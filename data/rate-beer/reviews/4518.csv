Its got a great bristly noble hop edge to it that makes it slice through the palate cleanly. The malt development gives it good structure and the lingering bite of the hops is satisfying. However, this didnt live up to my expectations. Its good, very good, but its not dazzling, vibrant, and vivacious. It doesnt have dark corners seeking to be found.

Poured on draft at The Trappist into a Trappist glass. 

A: Fantastic mix of sweet, grainy aroma and hops. Mixed citrus (mostly orange and lemon) and flower/herbal hop aroma. Hints of a bready malt aroma also lurk.
A: Pours a pale gold with a thin white head that leaves decent lacing. 
T: Extremely crisp, clean, dry, and smooth, yet still interesting. Slightly sweet light malt with yeast bread flavors enhanced by floral, grassy and citrus hop notes, as the nose suggested. 
P: Light body with substantial carbonation and a smooth feel. Moderately bitter finish.

And the crisp inviting grassy hops taste clean and smooth too. Excellent lingering grassy finish. Nice body. First impressions arent everything though. After a little while, the aroma gets a little grainy and the hops dont express as fully ss they could. It ends up having some unfinished wood character too and just doesnt hold up well as it warms. However, its a good effort, is well-constructed, and is better than most Americans can manage. The funny thing is, I felt the whole time this was more Germanic than Czech.

T - Starts off with a mix of light lemon flavor and some bready yeast flavor. There is just a bit of corn that comes in soon after. Through the middle, a touch of hops comes through and the yeast flavor grows a bit. The finish is a mix of lemon, corn, and yeast that lingers nicely.

Flavor is light dough, crisp cracker, slight mineral in the end with lots of fresh grassy and spicy saaz hops- clean finish and very easy drinking.

T: A good amount of grain matched against the noble hops, but nothing terribly special. Maybe its the hype, but this one really didnt live up to my expectations. Nothing really set it apart from other pilsners that Ive had.

4518,"2010-06-28",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
This Bohemian-style Pilsener displays snazzy Saaz over, within and after crisp pils malt crackers, building as authentic a pint of the style youll find this side of the Atlantic.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A fluffy sheet of foam covers the transparent golden. 
-If the nose had been more engaging (brighter hops), this would have been world-class.
-That spicy Saaz zing creates wonderful bitterness.
-The overall flavour profile is balanced.  
-Drinkability is optimal, even if one is used to lighter-bodied German examples.

4518,"2007-07-29",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 3, 2009 On tap, multiple locations.  Transparent pour of pale gold with a tall head of foamy white.  Clean herbal hop aroma that sits atop a solid pale malt bready base with firm bitterness.  Wonderful, rich melanoidin characters from the pils malt give it a light, green raisin character.  Clean, yeast-wise.  Light bodied, crisply carbonated mouthfeel with a soft, velvety texture.  Rich pils malt flavors overwhelm the palate immediately, high in maltiness but low in sugar.  The hops arrive mid-palate, providing a clean herbal and lightly spicy noble hop flavor.  A moderate hop bitterness lingers in the finish, drying up the palate nicely, quenching thirst.  Incredible malt complexity overall considering the simplicity; this has such a wonderful pils malt flavor that isnt matched by many other beers.  The softness on the palate really seems to accentuate the melanoidin qualities as well as the freshness of the hop flavors - there arent any harsh minerally qualities providing any unwanted astringency.  Wonderful Bo Pils.  When this is on, its pretty tough to beat.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
4518,"2007-07-25",3.4,"On tap at Toronado in San Francisco, ordered by our less-adventuresome beer buddy. Bright clear straw yellow with a robust white head demonstrating excellent retention. Very clean, fresh aroma of leafy/stemmy hops and grain. Crisp clean palate generously hopped and properly bittered. An excellent representation of the style.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
4518,"2007-07-23",3.5,"On tap at CIty Beer Store in S.F.  Thanks to Craig for the sample of this.  Smell was somehow of a spiced cream corn, and not corn in the way that cheap beers smell or taste of corn.  Light clearish yellow color with a unique taste to match the smell.  Has a nice almost spiced maybe subtle bitter bite to it, and was quite nice.  An interesting beer worth trying if you can get a shot at it.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"
4518,"2007-07-20",3.6,"Tap. Pours with a nice yellow color and a decent head. Probably one of the best US pilseners I have tasted. great nose of hops and grains. Very nice flavors of grains, malts and some hops. Maybe a bit bigger bodied than most European pilseners, but very clean tasting.","Bay Area, California, USA","HopheadHans"

4518,"2007-07-11",4.3,"Super fresh pint obtained at Lanesplitter in Berkeley.  Best bohemian style Pilsener Ive ever had.  Great saaz hop nose.  Very drinkable, very clean.  Fresh grain in the smell and the flavor.  A very simple brew, but so well made.  The yeast strain that Brians using for this brew seems to spit out a lot of sulphur, so sometimes youll get that in the nose too..  Unfortunately the kegs of this dont seem to age well, as Ive unfortunately had some old tasting pints of this around town.  Great, high quality session-able Pilsener.  Head and shoulders above Trumer.","Oakland, California, USA","nahthan"

4518,"2007-05-06",3.7,"(on tap @ toronado)yellow body with a white head.dry hay,sourdough bread,and a small hop profile make up the aroma and flavor.honestly is simple but really damn good.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Odeed"
4518,"2007-04-27",3.6,"At the brewery - fresh - with lots of hops beside me - a bit farty in the nose but also frehs crushed grain, which is also tastable. Fizzy carbonation, golden color, Enjoyable.","New Jersey, USA","YogiBeera"
4518,"2007-04-06",3.3,"(On tap - Toronado) Clear, pilsener golden with a small, white head leaving laces. Clean, malty aroma. Medium body with a very clean malt profile and then a dry, floral and rather hop-bitter finish. 250307","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"
4518,"2006-07-20",3.6,"Draught. Clear golden color with thin off white head that left no lace. Aroma was dominated by grassy hops, presumably saaz. The noble hops came out again in the flavor and were balanced nicely with a delicate biscuity malt note. Crisp, bubbly finish.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"
4518,"2006-02-24",4.8,"(on tap @ Flavor) pint is a hazy yellow with a nice head that retains and laces well. aroma is awesome - a big dose of noble hops overtop grainy/grassy malt notes. I cant say how much I like this nose - its what Prima wished it smelled like. flavor is clean and balanced, with both the hop and malt coming through clearly. finish is again excellent - very crisp and clean. again, I cant say enough for the drinkability, as it finishes with the perfect dryness and lightness to go in for more.","Oakland, California, USA","irishsnake"
4518,"2006-02-15",3.7,"Wonderful big grassy noble hop nose with a touch of honeyed malt. Soft yet full and rich mouthfeel with good bitterness. Very good conditioning with nice lacing. Big lingering finish of grass and gues what, even more grass.","manteca, California, USA","aspidites"
4518,"2005-10-26",3.7,"Draft. Light golden beer with a short white head. Nice spicy noble hop aroma and very fresh smelling. Lots of hops in this - its what you would imagine a super-hopped pils to be like. Some noble hop flavor with a kick off grassiness and some citrus. A touch of sweet malt backing. Hops linger. Nice aftertaste. Gone too fast.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
4518,"2005-09-25",4.5,"Getting to try this beer at a beer/food tasting in San Francisco was magical. Meeting Brian (AKA many other aliases) was great. He knows hell be missed at the GABF.Beautiful golden hue, bright and slightly floral aroma. Perfect hop accent with little sweetness and round, full grain flavor. I loved the subdued maltiness and the delightful lingering finish that somehow turned out to be juicy and rich. Almost perfect.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
4518,"2005-08-22",3.8,"Very fresh, crisp, and super hoppy. Cali-Czeck, if I may. An aroma that could find its way into my stubborn nose and battle all else in the cool room with holding tanks. Brian is a trip and he handed me a glass and a ticket to Pilsn. Thanks.","austin, Tejas, Texas, USA","fly"
