Quite hazy.Light pine, juicy mango and a hint of vanilla and honey. Definitely seems on the sweet side, again, from the nose, and again has a dull, bready, sort of tired/stale quality to it.

Anyhow, this one had some more bright fruit notes in the nose than the papaya with no alcohol or flaw.Sweet mango up front is complemented by moderately bitter simcoe hop notes of grapefruit, cherry, melon and pine.

4228,"2013-03-31",4.5,"Tired Hands Brewing Company is a small microbrew pub just outside of Philadelphia that was just rated as the #2 new brewery in the world by RateBeer.com. I had to check it out and give their lineup a try to see if it lived up to the hype. I was not disappointed! They dont bottle and have little, if any distribution, so good luck getting your hands on some of this unless you get out to the pub. The beers were all well above average and the food, atmosphere and workers were great too. Check out their website, and I encourage a visit anytime you get out towards Philly.

This brew is an American IPA with mangos called Mago Tago, that was a brewpub only release, and it only lasted a couple of days. I just happened to stop in when it was available, and after trying it, I had to take some home! The brewer must be into obscure progressive rock, the name of this brew has to be an homage to the German rock group Cans album Tago Mago. Here is my take on this glorious beer!
 
Apperance: It pours to a very cloudy, opaque straw yellow color with a bright white 1″ head, with tight bubbles that dropped down fairly quickly to about 1/4″ and stayed there through the rest of the beer, hanging on to the side of the glass, lacing like a quality Belgian Ale.
 
Aroma: Its a full-on frontal assault with ripe mango and tropical hop aroma hitting hard in the beginning, some sweet candied orange, a slight alcohol warmth, a light breadiness and some sour notes that I can only attribute to the fruit or wheat used when brewing. It wasnt off-putting at all, just minor background I picked up after swirling the beer a little.
 
Flavor:The sweet mango comes first again followed by a crisp tropical hop bite and a little sweet malt and wheat. A mild bitterness from the hops and low alcohol warmth hang on the back for just the right amount of time, creating a fantastic balanced finish. Finally, there is a pleasant tropical fruity tartness that stays on your tongue.
 
Mouthfeel: It has a very creamy mouthfeel from the wheat used in the brewing process, high carbonation and very dry finish. There is also a mild astringency caused by the fruit, but works perfectly with the medium body and dryness overall.
 
Overall: Tremendous balance in this brew, with the mango and tropical hops leading the way, the creamy texture and high carbonation brought it all together, toning down any bitterness and making this a special beer that I hope to see Tired Hands expand its production and maybe bottle for sale in the future. Think Zombie Dust or Alpha King by 3 Floyds Brewing Company with the perfect mix  of mangos! Awesome Stuff!","","Beergelden"

4228,"2013-03-29",3.8,"Draft. Pours a hazy, straw yellow color with a nice white head. Coming from Minneapolis I am used to Town Halls Mango Mama so I am interested to see what another Mango IPA is like. The nose is slightly fruity with minimal hop notes. The Mango only adds a touch of aroma. The taste is good, not overbearing with fruit or overly sweet. Nice balance with not too much fruit or hops bitterness. For me Id rather see this get a little more aggressive on the fruit or the hop characteristic as it just falls a little short but it drinks really easily and I found myself ordering it over and over.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"
4228,"2013-03-28",3.9,"Growler thanks to Jason on the other site. Pours a glowing, hazy, floatie filled gold with very minimal white head. Looks awesome in the glass. Aroma is mild with tropical notes but not overwhelming mango. Grass, some wet hay and some slight hop presence. Taste is more muted fruit with a nice IPA hoppiness. The mango works better as the beer warms and overall the earthiness of the mango comes through. Almost more of a meaty mango taste than the traditional sugary citrus approach we are used to with the fruit. Overall, a very nicely done beer but Id put this more on the IPA side than on the Fruit beer side. Not sure I would have known that there was actual mango in this if I didnt read about it first.","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"
