3269,"2016-12-18",3.7,"Pours a huge bubbly head but quickly dissipates and leaves a very thin layer. Ok lacing. Has a cloudy amber appearance with sediments clearly visible. Aromas are of citrus hops, some yeasty notes with mild spices and mild malts. Has a strong bitter citrus flavour, notes of coriander and orange peel. Some spices, mildly sour. Has a bit of tartiness. Bready malts. Full bodied mouthfeel with a slight tingling, nice warming feeling. Lively carbonation. Sort of a thick yeasty feeling on the palate. The 10%abv is not really noticeable at first. Goes down fairly easy. Pretty good stuff.","Winchester, Ontario, CANADA","AleRider78"
3269,"2015-10-08",5.0,"First impression is a very sparkling beer with a foam that is almost too perfect! Beads of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass and foam build up at all times below the crown. Before I lift the glass to your nose, I can already sense a fruity aroma spread. It has a good and promising aromas of ripe fruit and citrus, coriander and other gentle spice.
The taste is sweet as light syrup, but mixes fairly quickly with a tart flavor of green apples. Hop bitterness is not much, but instead have the aftertaste very pleasant and as a stop-filled basket of fruit: apples, lemon and light summer berries. Palate is top notch and the mouth feeling is sparkling so its a completely delight.","Valby, DENMARK","TorbenJensen"

Nez agréable et intéressant, bien complexe et bien intense. En bouche, pétillement élevé sur la langue, onctuosité moyenne au palais, belle rondeur, corps soyeux et éthylique.

Cette triple à 10% dalcool que nous offre temporairement Unibroue recèle un bouquet fruité et malté où lon retrouve des notes dépices, de levure, de banane mûre et de pain. Somme toute, cest un nez assez standard à la ""Unibroue"". En bouche, cest une explosion de sucre et de levure. Petites notes de fruits séchés et de bananes encore une fois qui se laissent courtiser par des flaveurs dépices. Cette bière rappelle un peu la Fin du monde... Cest bien là un défaut dUnibroue : ils font des produits excellents, mais les levures distinctives quils utilisent pour les brasser font en sorte quil y a des similitudes agaçantes entre leurs bières ; par exemple, je me verrais mal ouvrir une Don de Dieu après avoir bu cette Fringante, ni linverse dailleurs.

3269,"2013-01-12",3.9,"This beer pours a medium golden honey in colour with a thin head that quickly dissipates. Bottle conditioned with continous champagne like bubbles rising to the top.

Aroma is floral and slightly herbal (although not as much as La Fin Du Monde) and lightly grassy. A bit like Saaz hops. 

The taste is unique; again the herbal character comes through, and there is a persistent bitterness/phenolic note which is not unpleasant. The alcohol is quite hidden so Im not sure if youd want to consume more than 1 12 oz bottle in a session. A lot of the flavour comes from the yeast, and I like Belgian yeast very much.

A bit numbing on the tongue.

Dont know if its there, but God it tastes like coriander was added in large quantities.

Overall a nice beer, and I maintain that this is still Canadas best brewery even if they dont brew IPAs :)

The look: Partly cloudy golden yellow, some small particles, small white head
In long: This is a floral beer with a big nose of grapefruits, dandelions and some spices.  Taste expands on the nose.  Tropical fruits, lots of mint, peaches, honey, bananas.  10% is unfortunately apparent. Typical Unibroue yeasty feeling and Belgian carbonation.  Closely related to Unibroue Edition 2004.

Ginger, vanilla, honey, slight toffee and yeast. High carbonation, much like a champagne that caresses my toungue lightly. Flavour is relatively sweet, but has a fruity sour backend. It is vinious, but not alcoholic. Malty and quite well spiced - some peppery bitterness settles with the warming alcohol. Very nice brew indeed.

Appearance is again of apple juice. More clear than some other unibroue offerings. Carbonation was there, but has appeared to weaken over the years. Actually improces drinkability as a result.

I have no idea what that means, but the exclamation mark suggests it seemed like a ""Eureka!"" moment at the time - a profound discovery that would echo down the ages. Fortunately, the rest of the notes are less oblique, if thin on detail. This muddy golden beer was thick with proteins and raised a thin corona. Phenolic aroma showed some good malts, plus marmalade and a sour nail varnish note. The soft, creamy mouthfeel was a major plus. The flavour mix was tart, with sour lambic notes, sweet oranges and sherbet lemon candies. By no means a bad beer but not one of Unibroues best.

Tasted: December 2008 (13/20)
I dont think this beer has changed dramatically over the past 18 months. Appearance as per previous notes although theres plenty of floaties now in the glass. Still a meaty, yeasty, cooked fruits style (ie very Belgian). Finish is relatively modest in terms of intensity although some mild burn from the alcohol lifts the palate a touch. Not sure there is much point cellaring beyond 4 years?
Bottled: November 2004
Tasted: July 2006 (14/20)
Matched the Duvel (glass?) shape well. Big fizzy head, quite creamy in texture early but settles over the 10 minutes and breaks up. Vibrant pale orange, a touch cloudy, very Belgian. Very Belgian again on the nose, rich yeasty notes, and perhaps a trace of nettles of herb hops? Powerful palate; meaty, vegemite like, extracted fruits, earthy malts drive a flavour profile that is also very balanced for a 10%er. Very appropriate fizz levels carry the beer well as I sense it would cloy without the lift from the bubbles. Intensity faded a little over time, forcing a 1 point notch back.","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"

3269,"2006-04-29",3.4,"Interesting brew that had me scratching my head. If taste is 90% aroma then by all accounts this should have been a drain-pour. Yet, aroma aside, it was quite tight, balanced and tasty in the mouth. Poured into a Unibroue chalice from a very dusty cork-caged bottle. I have no idea the age of the sample but I vaguely remember purchasing it more than 2 years ago. Short, compact, creamy white head formed, produced no lace but managed to last the length. The body of beer a hazy yellow-gold with fine, whispy carbonation. Initially it was all sulphury yeast and wads of butter in the aroma. This didnt wane but was joined by some toffee, caramel, bread crumbs and spicy alcohol. Not overly inviting to say the least (may be the age!?!). Creamy and smooth in the mouth in typical Unibroue fashion. Carbonation is soft and the body seems medium to medium-light. Tangy, sweet toffee upfront with a short burst of fresh melonous fruits before drying, pasty wheat-like malts (agree with eczematic) and yeast and alcohol spice finish it off. Swallow is warming, the alcohol is present in high form but for 10% is quite in balance. Gently vinous fruity once it warms and becomes a little nutty towards the dregs of the bottle. Third glass was cloudy like a Hefe-weizen, but lacked the same appeal. A nice slow sipper, have to obviously try my next one fresh off the shelf.

3269,"2006-02-07",3.7,"Pours a hazy, straw gold color that is topped by a frothy, two-finger thick pale off-white head.  The aroma has sweet grain note that I associate with wheat.  There is also a fruity green apple note and a bit of underlying spiciness (that is quite evident, and pervasive, but hard to describe) made up of an earthy-herbal note, a hint of ginger, and a dry yeasty notes.  The aroma is pretty straight forward, but definitely nice.

The taste is fairly sweet, which accentuates a strong fruity note made up of apples and even a bit of plum.  The beer is pretty well carbonated and tends to become frothy as it hits the tongue.  The carbonation helps to balance the upfront, and even lingering, sweetness.  There is a dry, peppery, ginger-like note that tends to dry out the finish quite a bit.  There is a bit of astringency in the finish that is definitely derived from yeast fermentation characteristics, reminds me a bit of a warm fermentation.

Aroma of wild flowers, honey, vanilla, light coriander and other herbs, and a dry, almost nutty yeast, quite clean.  Flavor is plenty of honey-almond, coriander adding dryness, with a warming sensation on the end, and a very apparent, but still well-done yeastiness.  Touch of that Unibroue corn-sourness on the end, with light phenols and plenty of spicy dryness.  But the alcohol is still well-hidden.  The body is thick and malty, but yet the blissful carbonation breaks it apart, giving it a zesty if somewhat chewy feel.  Really seems like these guys unexpectedly made one of the first Double-witbiers.  Granted its a little lacking on some characteristics of the double wit, but its remarkably similar for such an old recipe (old relative to how new double wits are).  Thanks again Stephen!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3269,"2005-08-27",4.0,"750ml bottle dated 03/03/2003. Lost control of this one on the pour; very easy to do. Ended up with about 3 inches of fluffy white head in my Duvel tulip, which I think managed to show the beer off to best effect. Under the head was a hazy light gold with plenty of lively bubble action. Not much lacing left behind as it disappeared (fairly rapidly, I must say). Aroma was a little muted, with hints of citrusy orange peel, a little vineous sourness, and some belgian yeasty funk. Taste to me seemed to lack a little depth and complexity (say, compared to a classic like Karmeleit). Dont get me wrong, there was plenty there, the high ABV was extremely well hidden, but it seemed like a dimension was missing. Having said that, there must have been a massive malt backbone to hide the ABV, which was really well balanced, with only a slight peppery finish giving it away. Hops were really well done as well, stuff all in the aroma, but balancing the malt sweetness almost perfectly in the finish. Palate was un-obtrusive, complemented the flavours, but was not in the ""rave"" catagory to me (like some of the De Dolles). This stuff is really easy to drink; I could easy have demolished another 750 (if I could afford it at AUD15 a bottle) and suffered the consequences.","Brisbane beer desert, AUSTRALIA","hefevice"

Undertones of wheat and yeast run throughout finishing fruity and displaying some subdued bitters. The feel is light, lively, and so refreshing masking any hint of the 10% ABV found within.

3269,"2005-06-05",3.9,"Ive had a few of these before but just realised I have never gotten around to rating it. Enticing non specific floral citrus nectar hits you immediately on opening the bottle. Pours as an attractive slightly hazy gold with a medium size short lasting pale yellow head. Ongoing aroma is still citrus floral but not as strong as first opening of the bottle, grainy wheat, faintly spicy and hint of celeriac like vegetable yeast. Palate is mellow soft and low carb. Flavour wise it reminds me of aged Duvel or a less cabonated Karmeliet. Medium honey and light sweetness, and yeast  manages to mask the high ABV surprisingly well but quickly warms the ears. Overall I kept looking for a touch more ooph but its not pretending to be anything other than a pleasant mellow ale.

The scent is as pleasing as anything I?ve ever had: lush wheaty lemons, coriander, lime, citric acid, and forcing a fruity and floral bouquet of sweet grains, alcohol and lemon zest into the nose.  The flavor is light and crisp citrus, lemons, wheat, semi-tart yeast and that wonderful house Unibroue flavor.  Perhaps I?m overrating, but I don?t think I can honestly find anything I don?t like about this beer.  Maybe it?s the witbier fan in me, because the lucious wheat and lemon flavors combined with a crisp and light body, even with this high of an alcohol content, are perfect.

Rastacouere is the Bad Ass Canadian Beer Trader that sent me this beer last December; this guy ROCKS! 

 Pours beautifully blond, with a slight hue of orange. The head is a billowing rocky  mass of cotton. 
Aroma is very much like the typical Triple style beer. Wait, but this is Not a Triple! Has a Full yeasty aroma, very much buttered & biscuity insanely long fruity notes of apple and cantaloupe. The flavor brings even more infinite suggestions of apple, cantaloupe, honeydew and cotton candy. This is like a Sunday morning fruit compote, but with a glass of champagne mixed in. Small notes of cardamom, basil, an black pepper are in the support, but truly massive notes of clove take control!  The palate is very airy and light but in the same instance, its sticky and velvety. I am very much enjoying this rarity!

3269,"2004-03-09",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2004 Head is initially average sized, fizzy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy medium yellow, bottle conditioned.

Flavor is heavily sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, velvety/syrupy texture, soft carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Well, I'll be damned, another strong Belgian-style golden ale from Unibroue, who'd'a thunk it?  Very good, very fruity and floral, as always a strong effort, but I definitely think Unibroue 11 was their best execution of this overdone (for them) style...pity that was a one-off.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Carbonation is tight and aroma of spice with usual Unibroue hops style. Taste of alcohol is not subtle and even too strong that it hides the mix of spice. This is definitely not the best from Unibroue and it seems to me that it is just another variation of their usual Belgian ale.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

Fine aromatic flavours around the main sweeter taste; flowery, spicey and sugar-preserved lemony. Very dry, but tingling sensation, related to the surrounding aromatic taste, is very remarkable.

Trace of soil and leaf.  Surprisingly, its sweeter than it is floral.  More of a clean Hallertauer earthiness, than the anticipated big Styrian Golding juiciness.

It poured a very light yellow, with a fairly large head and a wild wild sea of carbonation. The aroma was just brimming with spice...so much so that it got up my nose and burned the HELL out of something up there (hopefully not my brain..) It had hints of wood, spices, and yeast in the aroma specifically. The tatse was very yeasty, extremely spicey and peppery, with undertones of citrusy lemon hiding in there making for an extremely bittering experience. The carbonation made the drink very soda-like almost and really took away from the ability to distinguish and enjoy most of the flavors and spices this thing had to offer. This one ended very dry as expected, but also threw in a nice tartness right in the finish. I think the pepper was a bit overboard, but i really liked the lemon/citrus qualities here.
