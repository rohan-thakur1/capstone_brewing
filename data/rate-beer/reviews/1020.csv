1020,"2016-12-31",4.3,"From notes. Enjoyed at a tasting Kyle finally made it to at Mickeys on December 01. 750 mL bottle, batch 3. The pour is a lighter black with a thin ring of dark tan head and a couple spots of lace. The aroma is pretty good. There is a strong spiciness from the chilies and cinnamon, but the chocolate really mutes it. The barrel offers a further balance and a hint of vanilla. The light woodiness really adds a touch of sweetness that I like. The flavor is just as good. The complexity and depth really stand out. Chilies, cinnamon, chocolate, light vanilla, whiskey sweetness, and a light woodiness. This is just so complex and lovely. The mouth feel is light and not as viscous as Id want. The carbonation is on point, and the aftertaste is lingeringly sweet whiskey and spicy chocolate. Its really good. Damn.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
1020,"2016-11-05",4.1,"2015 bottle. Pours dark with almost no foam head. The aroma is full of cinnamon, spicy, good whiskey and oak notes, chocolate, roasted malts, and a sugary sweetness.

1020,"2016-09-30",4.7,"Draft at Snallygaster 2016. The only beer I have ever done an old man fast-walk to get in line for. Glad I did. Near black with small tan head. Dark chocolate, molasses, booze, vanilla, chili spice, cinnamon, all integrated perfectly. The quintessential spiced stout. Just an amazing beer.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","DCLawyer"
1020,"2016-09-18",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 24, 2016 Tap at Snallyghaster 2016 showing pitch black with quickly dissipating latte colored foam. 

The nose shows notes of vanilla and molasses. Upon warming up, a clear coconut profile comes out. 

The palate is full bodied and syrup slick showing barely any carbonation. Vanilla and clean coconut notes ring throughout the beer with the attack beginning with a mix of light chocolate, cinnamon, and tobacco. A very distinct alcoholic spiciness also appears in the front end. The mid palate shows intense coconut with a finish on light tobacco and burnt notes. Not bad at all, but I fully prefer the non-barrel aged version.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"
1020,"2016-05-27",4.8,"This is just so much better than regular Abraxas in every aspect. Not too much herb, much more cinnamon forward, thick mouthfeel, full body, crazy taste overall. Extremely complex beer. Rye whiskey barrel tastes fantastic!","","Hugetaste42"
1020,"2016-04-02",4.1,"Pours an opaque black from the bottle, motor oil thick with thin ring of bubbly tan brown head. Aroma of big barrel notes over hints of spice and roast.

1020,"2015-12-26",4.8,"This barrel aged example is one of the best stouts made today. The aroma smells like chocolate, chili and cinnamon. It has a dark appearance but not as black as many of the stouts. The taste is quite amazing with hints of the chillis, the cacao nibs, vanilla with that slightly spicy aftertaste. The Rye barrels fit it perfectly and the 11% is disguised quite well. Look forward to trying again soon. Cheers!","Illinois, USA","spycow"
1020,"2015-12-16",4.1,"Pitch black and completely opaque without even a trace of lighter color. Half finger dark mocha head that quickly settles into a thin ring. Minimal spotty lacing left behind. Nice color but has poor retention. Foam head fades and theres not much in the way of lacing. 

The nose on this beer is really incredible. Excellent barrel character that doesnt completely overpower the complex malt bill of the base. Perfectly integrated. A touch of damp oak and subtle toothpick but not too strong of a wood flavor. Really nice spirit with spicy whiskey/boozy bourbon flavor. Barrel also gives off a lot of vanilla bean, toasted coconut and gooey marshmallow. Underneath, there is a very nice blend of roasted and sweet, desert-like malts. Subtle roast but not overpowering with some coffee bean, burnt toast, smoke, oatmeal and bitter dark chocolate. This is countered by silky chocolate-like sweetness, caramel, milk chocolate, lactic cream, fudge and molasses. This beer smells crazy good. 

Full body with oily viscosity and a blast of boozy heat that lingers over the other barrel notes and complex malts into a dry, hot finish. Lots of alcohol flavor and the ABV isnt very well masked. spicy rye whiskey along with dry oak/toothpick. Barrel isnt as complex as in the nose. Spirit is really strong and it has a stronger wood flavor than I prefer. Some subtle vanilla/coconut sweetness. Malts flavors are still lingering underneath but they are blasted and overwhelmed by the heat/whiskey. Stronger roasted malt presence than expected with burnt sugary sweetness. Deeply roasted robust espresso/coffee flavor along with smoke, burnt wood, charred toast and bitter dark cocoa. As the palate adjusts the sweet fudge/bakers chocolate notes start to show. Pretty good but isnt as complex as expected. The chile spiciness and cinnamon show up after it warms but the palate needs to adjust to the overwhelming whiskey and heat. Smells great but its really hot and boozy and the malt bill is overly charred/roasted. Decent but kind of underwhelming considering the fanfare.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

1020,"2015-07-11",4.5,"750-ml 2014 bottle. The spices (red chiles, cinnamon, black pepper, and cumin) dominate the nose but a good amount of chocolate and whiskey manage to shine through the heat, followed by some anise.

Flavors of milk chocolate, incredibly smooth whiskey, a touch of oak woodiness, only moderate spiciness despite the hot nose, a hint of caramelized sugar, solid vanilla, and charred malt all dance on the tongue.

1020,"2014-12-27",4.6,"Thanks to Matt and Kevin, shared with my family on Christmas Eve.

Pours a viscous black color, with a small, fluffy, dark brown head, leaving back a perfect, thin lacing at the side of the glass.

Smells of sweetened cinnamon on top of earthy malts, bakers chocolate and a gentle amount of coffee. The Bourbon qualities arent too present on their own, but blend very well into the chili spices, adding heat and wood to the nose. Notes of molasses provide a sweetness to the brew, which gets supported by the omnipresent cinnamon spiciness outstandingly well. 

Begins with rich cinnamon flavors straight from the beginning, while earthy, toasted malts, as well as slightly bitter coffee build the foundation of this beer. The cinnamon gets a bit sticky and dusty, while it turns pretty intense on the palate, with molasses and toffee adding a lot of sweetness to its dominant spiciness. The Bourbon barrel, mirroring the nose, doesnt turn very present on its own, while it interacts perfectly well with the chilies, leaving the spicy cinnamon with an interesting, hot and complex touch on the palate. The sweetness gets balanced by a wooden Bourbon bite, which got a semi dry, bitter aspect to it, highlighting the earthy malts. 

Finishes with a sublte, spicy burn, while coffee becomes more present, still with a slick sweetness detectable, which is now calmed by the wooden maltiness, while the Bourbon shines through in its wooden, vanilla qualities, with a peppery bite. Has an incredible smooth mouthfeel, with a hot burn in the end. The beers body is incredible full and quite different to the normal version, while providing less coffee, way more cinnamon and the proper sweetness.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Pours incredibly black, inky, viscous, and ends up with a finger and a half of dark brown head, creamy looking, too. Incredible aroma of sweet chocolate and cinnamon, spicy rye whiskey, very very faint peppers, vanilla, roasted marshmallows. Its like cinnamon smores with whiskey, though the whiskey supports rather than overpowers the smell. Flavor follows with awesome cocoa powder and cinnamon, vanilla whiskey notes, ever so slight spice and warmth that lingers from a combination of the peppers and the alcohol. Thick and viscous, though not syrupy, low carbonation but enough bubbles to keep things thick, and very rich with a slightly roasty dry finish. I was expecting more whiskey on this one, but it melds into the beer so well. Seems very much worth the hype here.

Nothing is jumping out and dominating the palate, but each ingredient makes it;s presence known. Nice cocoa and vanilla sweetness that cuts the pepper heat and barrel character nicely.

A - Pours black with a nice one and a half finger tall tan head, quickly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small trails of lace down the sides of the glass.


S - Smells of warm bourbon, strong chili heat, room temperature chocolate, vanilla beans, fresh ground cinnamon and a bit of light booze. Was really hard to finish my glass because it smelled so incredible.


T - Starts off with a quick hit of chocolate, caramel and vanilla sweetness quickly being joined by hints of cinnamon, chillies, drying oak and smooth bourbon burn. Finish is pretty sweet with some heat, lingering for quite awhile. Not as intoxicating as the nose but still really damn good.


M - Heavy body with moderate carbonation. Despite the big, roasty body it was still really smooth, only a bit of booze creeping in at the end of each sip.


O - This might be the best chili stout I have ever had. It packs all of the flavors I enjoyed in the base beer and the bourbon was strong but not over the top.

1020,"2013-08-04",4.0,"Bottle (750 ml). From Mark, huge thanks for this one! Tasted a couple of beers after the regular Abraxas. Reddish black with a small dark reddish-brown head that leaves little to no lacing. Aroma is as described: lot of cinnamon, ancho chile, cacao, vanilla, whiskey and wood. Taste is about the same with the ancho chile being more present. At first, the bourbon and cinnamon are more present, then the dark chocolate and spices/chile take most of the place. Warming/spicy finish. Hot. Full bodied. Moderate carbonation. Oily mouthfeel. Very complex and absolutely unique. The balance is only average (quite good considering everything going on in there), but so much better than in the regular one. The barrel treatment really enhance this beer and make it multi-layered compared to the completely unidimensional regular Abraxas.

Somehow,  the time spent in the rye barrel with the cacao nibs, ancho chilies, vanilla beans, and cinnamon, results in a fantastic marriage of chocolate and peanut butter  think Funky Buddhas Dont Tell Reece or an imperialized Shorts Über Goober Oatmeal Stout - along with some more subtle notes of rye whiskey, pouch tobacco and cinnamon. Medium to full-bodied with a lightly creamy mouthfeel and jazzy carbonation. The flavor somewhat mirrors the nose  chocolate, peanut butter, vanilla and coconut accompanied by a pleasant measure of alcohol warmth. Peanuty, chocolaty, vanilla finish.

But this beer is every bit Hunahpus equal, but also distinctly different. Nose is big on chili and cinnamon mixed with chocolate the effect is almost peanut butter like. This beer is just silly with chocolate. Its prominant in the nose but its all over the flavor. The mouthfeel like Hunanpus is huge and thick. Silky Smooth on the palate and scarily drinkable. Finish with a flash of chocolate and lingering chili and cinnamon. One of the best beers Ive had in some time.

1020,"2013-03-12",4.6,"Bottle generously shared by Seth.  Dark brown/black pour with a chocolate head.  Great lacing.  Cinnamon, caramel and fudge blast the old sniffer.  Great body with big fudge, rich caramel, and cinnamon notes that give way to the heat from the ancho chilies.  Wow, a real stunner.  Good carbonation, good balance, great mouthfeel.  Its simply delicious,what more can I say...","Florida, USA","50belair"
1020,"2013-03-11",4.8,"Bottle. Pours pitch black with a nice brown head leaving some lacing. Aroma is intense chocolate bourbon vanilla cinnamon roasted malty a bit ashy. Flavor is just as great as the aroma; fullbodied velvety chocolate cake, vanilla, dryish rye and bitterness are great, a bit boozy, cinnamon and the chilies coming through nicely, too. Fantastic treat whoever had the bottle withhim to the Friday evening madhouse tasting.","SWEDEN","tkrjukoff"
1020,"2013-03-10",4.3,"Nice stuff! Aroma is bourbon, vanilla, mole, cinnamon, chocolate, and light roast. Pour is dark black, with a tan head. Taste is similar with dried chilis, fudge, some cinnamon, bourbon, vanilla, and tons of chocolate. Very nice treatment to this one.","Florida, USA","OmegaX"
1020,"2013-03-10",4.9,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2013 Black, dark brown head. Nose is rich dark chocolate cake, light spices and cinnamon. Taste is just huge artisan dark chocolate cake, vanilla, cherries and light spices in the background. Creamy mouthfeel. A work of art.","","knickskicks"
1020,"2013-03-09",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 21, 2013 Preismj! Black pour no head tan collar. Aroma of chocolate chli. Light body huge chili taste lingers.  Chocolate very tasty. Not much carbonation.","Sarasota, Florida, USA","stevencon"

1020,"2013-03-01",4.1,"Bottle provided by Cory himself. Ominous black in color of the pour with a small amount of cocoa colored head. Nose is incredibly complex, maple syrup, bourbon, cinnamon...it does actually smell like French toast or cinnamon toast crunch. Flavor is less complex and heavier on the cinnamon and spice.  There isnt a whole ton of barrel character, but there is enough spicy rye present. Moderately mouthfeel, a little oily, a lot of proper heat, and a moderate to long finish. This is a nice beer and definitely an improvement on the base. Great job guys!","Illinois, USA","Dunt"
1020,"2013-02-28",4.6,"Black pour, dark brown head. Way better than the original. Tons of cinnamon, chili, chocolate and sweet vanilla booze goodness. Oh yeah","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
1020,"2013-02-16",4.2,"Courtesy of dak. It pours murky deep mahogany with very little head. The aroma is full up fresh shredded coconut with dark roasted malts, molasses and chocolate brownie. The taste delivers some rich dark roasted malts mingling with a mild chili pepper like spiciness and then a cinnamon to ginger like note. Behind those flavors I get booze and chocolate fudge. Dandy.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
1020,"2013-02-08",4.7,"On tap. Pour is black with a sanguine brown head. Aroma is loaded with brown sugar, maple syrup, light roasted malt, cinnamon, light cocoa, vanIlla, and coconut. Flavor is also loaded with coconut, vanilla, maple, brown sugar, cinnamon, faint spice, and faint alcohol. This is amazing. I love huge, complex beers. This one fits the bill but is round and no one flavor dominates. A lot going on here but I love it.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"
1020,"2013-02-08",4.3,"From Dak.  Pours dark brown that practically stains the glass.  Aroma is chocolate, cinnamon, chili.  Taste is sweet with some heat.  Very good.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","dcschiller"
1020,"2013-02-07",4.7,"750 ml bottle from a great trader in St. Louis- thanks again, Kevin! Pours a midnight brown color, totally opaque, with a small brown head that instantly dissipates into a ring of somehow lighter tan color. Cinnamon and brown sugar immediately jump out of the aroma, with notes of vanilla, oak and rye whiskey, then a big dose of chocolate, and some roast and faint chile notes. Cant decide if it smells like gingerbread or Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Or cinnamon graham crackers. Very cool, whatever the comparison. Flavor of cinnamon, vanilla, coffee, cocoa beans, oak, rye whiskey, and chiles. Medium-bodied, with a smooth, sweet, then spicy mouthfeel and modest carbonation. Very rich, tasty, and complex. Wow. Great beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
1020,"2013-02-06",4.4,"Sampled at an rsbls tasting.  What a good looking pour.  Black.  A reddish tan head.  Thick looking.  The aroma is bourbon and malts.  Nice.  Maybe as thick as any berr I have had.  So rich.  Bourbon is a little more subtle than the aroma.  Big dark fruit including raisin.  Powdery chocolate.  There is so much going on in this beer.  Chilies late.  Wow.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
1020,"2013-02-03",4.1,"Sampled at FOBAB 12. Rich hot chocolate cinnamon aromas. Bourbon caramel and vanilla sweet flavors are interesting. A creamy sweet imperial stout thats earthy and nicely spiced. Really good. 9/4/8/4/16","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"
1020,"2013-01-28",3.3,"Dark head, spicy chile aroma , sweet taste. The regular Abraxas is better than the barrel aged version by a mile.

1020,"2013-01-24",4.4,"January 24, 2013 on tap at brewery. Okay so this looks like the regular and aroma is pretty close as well. Taste is not quite as good though. The rye whiskey probably was not the best choice as it adds more spice. Still enjoyed this, but different barrels might work better.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
1020,"2012-12-22",4.2,"Sample FOBAB 12 - description sold me on this one, as Im a huge fan of rittenhouse rye, and theres nothing wrong with cacao, cinnamon and ancho chiles!  Pour is brown/black with a medium sized tan head.  Aroma is...woah...cinnamon forward - but theres a lot else in there...sweet malt, chocolate, toffee, vanilla, smooth whiskey in the background - this stuff is pretty solid and definitely different!  Flavor is very intriguing and original as well - the cinnamon is still very prevalent, but theres a healthy dose of chocolate, spice, vanilla, roasted malt, and after a while, some gentle heat kicks in - I loved this aspect of the beer - the chile was there, but it didnt try to steal the show.  Barrel aging seemed to smooth things out in general, and the rye whiskey is also there, but not forward.  Palate seemed appropriate for the drink.  This one impressed - very solid beer and one Id LOVE to try again to appreciate it further!","Valparaiso, Indiana, USA","valpoaj"
1020,"2012-11-27",4.2,"Sampled at FoBAB 10 - 2012 (Chicago, IL). Pours a rich deep big blackish opaque pour, dark and thick with a creamy tannish head atop. Laces ok. Aromas are spicy cinnamon and mexican chocolate, gentle spirit, oak, vaniilla, toffee. Toast, some vanilla and cinnamon. Gentle spice. Initial is rich flavors, big spicy cinnamon, vanilla, pie spice. Vanilla, roasty, fudge and cocoa. Some toasty malts, barrel is gentle spice, kiss of heat. Rich sweet cakey fudge and flavors. A bit sweet. Backend and finish is vanilla, roast, toast, and toffee. Spicy cinnamon and mexica chocolate, luscious flavors. Nice damn beer. Perennial really won the day for me at FoBAB along with a couple other brewers.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
1020,"2012-11-23",4.1,"Fobab #3

Pours a black color with a small head that dissipates very quickly. 

The aroma is coconut and cinnamon for the most part. The beer is invitingly sweet smelling, pungent, and spicy. If you described it to me in these terms I would assume that I wouldnt like it, but its awesome. 

The flavor is spicy and sweet, very chocolaty with some nice espresso character, some roastiness, some charred oak, cinnamon and coconut. All around its pretty sweet beer.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
1020,"2012-11-20",3.8,"Sampled from the tap at FOBAB 2012. Pours black with a dark brown head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has cinnamon and light peppers with a backbone of sweet dark grains and rye barrel. Flavor has cinnamon throughout with a bit of heat from the peppers with backing dark grains and roasted malts.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
1020,"2012-11-17",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 24, 2013 The extra age turns this one into an almost cinnamon toast crunch beer. Super cinnamony and stroung whiskey notes.

In bottle it is even better.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
1020,"2012-11-16",4.6,"On tap:  The aroma is an outstanding combination of chocolate, cinnamon rolls, vanilla, and a touch of chili peppers.  Its a dark brown with some orange highlights and a one finger beige head with good retention.  There is some nice webbing left on the sides of the glass.  The flavor starts with a good dose of milk chocolate.  There is a good cinnamon roll backbone.  The finish has some roasted coffee, vanilla, and some light chili pepper heat.  Its medium bodied with mild carbonation and a soft mouthfeel.  Overall, this is only FoBAB eve, but this is going to be tough to beat for the weekend.  I really dug this.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
