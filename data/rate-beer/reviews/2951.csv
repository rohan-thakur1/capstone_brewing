Crisp and lasting apple sweetness on the flavor thats not too sugary, and doesnt have an obnoxious champagne yeast tone throughout. Just a plain and medium-sweet apple cider.

2951,"2016-08-13",3.2,"This draft Cider from a beer bar poured a very small sized head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that were very quickly diminishing and left behind a uncarbonated transparent weak yellow white colored body and a fair lacing. The mild aroma was green apple. The crisp mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a medium fruity aftertaste. The mild flavor contained notes of green apple. A decent one that I would consider drinking again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
2951,"2016-07-21",3.4,"This is kind of an adult version of Woodchuck or whatever soda pop cider you might come across. Its still a bit sweet but at a more subtle level, carbonation is high and there is a bit of the complexity you get out of actual fermented apple juice. There is a touch of smokiness from the yeast, some floral notes and a bit of white grape. It finishes clean and crisp w/ just a touch of tartness. I reckon this is a pretty reasonable thing to drink.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
