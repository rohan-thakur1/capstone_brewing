2110,"2016-07-21",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
This dry and bubbly hopheads brew shares citrus fruit galore and lemongrass allusions before green bitterness impersonates a few blades of grass.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sizeable head of foam covers the hazy blond.
-Im not sure this beer was intended to be that carbonated. In any case, it turned out to wonderfully complement the hop aroma and flavors.
-This brew has lots of personality.
-The citrus fruit allusions are impressive and not linear From lemons to starfruit, they are all juicy and fresh.

2110,"2016-04-19",3.8,"330 ml can bought at Great Food Hall in Pacific Place, Admiralty.
Looks: Cloudy hazy light golden with lumps of yeast particles; Less than one quarter finger head with soapy white foam which fades in 20 seconds; Excellent sticky lacing and zero carbonation.

Aroma: Strongly fragrant and sweet Ale malt, with passion fruits, papaya, mango, floral nectar, honey, yeast, lemon zest and strong fresh grass.

Taste: Mid to light sweet fair Ale malt, with strong grapefruits, strong floral, molasses, resins, dry biscuits, yeast, strong lemon, strong biter hops, strong sharp grass.

Body: Close to light body. Slick and fairly oozy palate.

Mouth Feel: Fairly good Ale maltyness in a thin but very slick background. Very intense citrus flavors in solid grapefruits, strong lemons and sharp grass. Low sweet, quite Oozy and yeasty. Very refreshing!

Hoppiness: Passion fruits, papaya, mango, floral nectar, lemon and fresh grass in nose. Strong grapefruits, floral, resins, strong lemon and sharp grass in taste; Bitterness is strong for a lasting, very high astringent bitter sweet finish.

After Taste: Dry. Citrusy and strong bitter to mouth.

Comments: The brewer wants us to guess the hops here (sans Riwaka), and my two cents are mixes of Motueka and Nelson Sauvin. Anyway, I am surprised by its intense sweet tropical fruit aroma, and very strong citrusy hoppy taste all the way. It looks light but nothing wimpy in all aspects. A winner!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

2110,"2015-01-20",3.6,"from Brewers Droop, Bristol
660ml Bottle [BBE:14NOV2015]
4.3% version

A favourite of the Bristol populous without a doubt. When I hear so much about a beer, I have a tendency to avoid it. I imagine it will lack interest and be a people pleaser, not an experimental or at least avant garde creation attempt. But after my experience with the same Brewerys Confidence I think it may be time to bite this bullet. Its a recent version - 4.3.% however, brewed at the new premises in Bristol.

First impressions for aroma are mandarin, citrus with some pineapple and even papaya like notes. Subtle hints of fairy liquid and tropical fruity flannels. The flavour is orange citrus with some lemon and a grainy caramel biscuit malt flavour. The overall impression is zingy, with tropical fruit flavours, sharp almost. This is balanced though, by the spotted malt backbone to bring the zing down to the ground and a peculiar dryness suggesting, as they mention, elderflower, or a white wine. Aside from being a bit more bitter than I expected, its a fairly safe beer, however it does bring some unique and exciting flavours to the table (or desk or floor) to warrant its place among what are considered more craft beers.

2110,"2009-10-10",4.4,"Mr Moor has done it again.  My first wow beer made with Kiwi hops was Roosters/Outlaw Wild Mule a couple of years back (I think) when all this green gooseberrylicious Marlborough Sauvignon flavour burst up my nose.  That was/is an excellent beer but Southern Star is better.  These hops are so focused and aromatic it would be shame not to use them for aromatic purposes.  A wonderful nose of gooseberry and citrus with a hint of honey/vanilla/malty character that is so appetizing. Green and grassy, as soon it enters your mouth a quick rush of hops engulfes (gently yet quickly) your entire mouth before rounded, soft, slightly sweet and assertive malt takes charge to form the base for the hops to shine.  And boy do they shine, just like the sexy, classy, green tinged, pale, golden colour of the beer itself, as if New Zealands sunniest day arrived alongside the racy Riwaka and jumped into the glass headfirst enjoying every second.  All the green flavours bounce around the palate before an immaculately measured bitterness kicks in and allows everything to linger for much longer.  Great sight, great smell, great taste, great finish - complexity and drinkability, aromatics and body, its all there.  Next week I get to try some thats unfined and I really cant wait!","Somerset, ENGLAND","Crunchie"
2110,"2009-09-16",3.9,"Cask-conditioned at the Bag ONails, Bristol 16/09/09. Golden in colour with a decent, frothy white head. Hoppy aroma of gooseberries, citrus and also some balancing sweetness. Very easy drinking, with plenty more fruity New Zealand Hop character, a touch of caramel and a lingering, dryish finish. Hugely drinkable.","Bristol, Gloucestershire, ENGLAND","downender"
