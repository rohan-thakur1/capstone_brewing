544,"2011-08-04",3.8,"On tap during MBF 2010, RBSG. Blaaaaaaack, good head - its raining, storming and lightning and pouring like you wouldnt believe - it is a MESS. The tents are getting hammered and everyone is soaked. Huge chocolate, smooth creamy chocolate, wheres the wheat? I cant hit that at all. All chocolate, bit of hops getting cooked up here, more of this sweetness and a bit of booze, smells good with a bit of fruit on the back end - young and fresh and finally a hit of wheat - its alright. Tastewise this could be better - chocolate, wheat, orange, slightly sour - getting lazy as I yell at my phone over the rain, Goes down good and finishes with more chocolate.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

Medium body with a oily smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy dark chocolate sweet flavor with a medium to heavy spice sweet finish of moderate to0 long duration.

544,"2010-07-29",4.2,"Draft RBSG 2010 This beer rocks! Clear, nearly black ale with a mid-sized, creamy, khaki head. Great retention. Crimson highlights dazzle when held up to light. The nose is big mocha, banana, vanilla and deeply roasted grains. Full-bodied and velvety with fizzy/airy carbonation. The hearty, nutty, mocha flavor lends additional essences of singed grains and banana. Leans toward the sweet side of balance, but not by much. Finishes crisp; but also filling and roasty. Unique world class beer!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

544,"2010-03-21",4.0,"On tap at brewpub. Dark brown, beige head, resembles an impy stout. Aroma is dominated by chocolate, has to warm quite a bit to get any banana, not getting the clove like others mentioned. Flavor again dominated by chocolate, really sweet, at times borderline cloying. Again only hints of banana, but there is some chewy/bready wheat. Huge body/mouthfeel, turns very oily slick. Sort of confusing at times, but works in a strange way. A stouties session beer dream.","Lincoln Park, Michigan, USA","Styles"
544,"2010-03-19",4.0,"Big wheaty and chocolatey nose, roasted notes. Some sweetness and nice wheat throughout. Black pour, nice creamy beige head. Chocolatey notes throughout, wheaty, touch of roast. Subtle but flavorful, well done. Good carbonation, very solid beer.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"

Nice blend of chocolate, bananas, light bubble gum and wheat...all so evident yet balanced.  The chocolate and banana wheat just work so well here.

544,"2010-03-16",4.4,"Godofthunder(I think?) Dark brown pour.  Fluffy tan head.  Aroma is milk chocolate, wheat, and roasted nuts.  Flavor is a unreal blend of chocolate, nuts, wheat.  Back and forth from chocolate to wheat.  What an amazing beer.  Part weizen, part chocolate beer, part stout! Unique and wonderful.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
544,"2010-03-09",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2010 Big Thanks to BBB63 for the heads up at the MI Winter Fest. Grabbed a full glass on our way out and was lucky to score a growler at the pub a week later.both were equally as good.Pours a dark brown with nice creamy khaki head. Nice lacing on my snifter.Aroma is quite nice with bananas, chocolate, cloves, and faint roasted coffee. The chocolate is the dominating aroma but it blends so nicely with the othersFlavor follows suit with more of the chocolate, bananas, and cloves.Nice creamy mouthfeel that helps the flavors linger for a while.I could seriously drink this beer everyday. Its like a great dunkelweizen with an extra layer of chocolate. This was one of the top beers at the fest that included all the MI brewing heavyweights and was quite the surprise considering most of the other Blue Tractor offerings have been quite boring. I sure hope they keep this one on for quite a while. I can see quite a few growler stops in the very near future. Thanks again Mike for the heads up and hopefully this becomes a standard brew instead of a one time seasonal.","Allen Park, Michigan, USA","northernbrews"
544,"2010-03-08",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2016 Growler from the brewpub. Pours black (a bit brown around the edges) with no head. Aroma is interesting with chocolate throughout but a light undertone of wheat. Flavor is full of dark chocolate but is amazingly light at the same time. Mouthfeel is just like a like a lighter version stout. It makes for a very unique and drinkable but chocolatey beer.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
544,"2010-03-05",4.3,"MiBG Winter Fest 2010: This deep brown beer was topped by a lasting foamy head that displayed a wonderful aroma of chocolate covered bananas and coffee with a bit of more weizen esters of clove and pepper, some smoke and roast, simply a WOW! I was worried that the flavor would not match the nose or be muddled and sweet but I was quickly surprised about how the profile of wheat and yeast characteristics matched the chocolate with a twangy fruit and bittersweet note backed by a light spiciness and coffee hint. The mouth feel is lively and aggressive, far more body than expected with the genre, oily as well and that is likely from the chocolate. SIMPLY SHOCKING, a surprise not only because of the wonderful hybrid tones of the brew but that this brewery had not shown much of interest in the past. The BEST OF SHOW and so good that I will be homebrewing a clone of this in the next few weeks.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
