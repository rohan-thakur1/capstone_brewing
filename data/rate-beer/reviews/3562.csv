It was a deep dark purple-ish red colour with a one finger purple-ish pink colour head that dissipated fairly quickly while leaving some sparse lacing. Tart and sour with a Ribena like aroma of blueberry, blackcurrant and grape with hints of grapefruit. Tastes tart and lightly sour. Again like the aroma, the Ribena comes through with blackcurrant, blueberry and grape. There is also hints of salt. Sourness increases towards the end along with acidity.

Refreshing and moreish, wish could drink a big jug of this in the summer. Just getting to the end of bottle here, would recommend giving the base a swirl - the dregs are fairly mind blowing.

3562,"2016-12-28",3.4,"0.33 l bottle from Beergium, best before April 2017. Clear, deep bordeaux with a thin, frothy, slowly diminishing, pinkish white head. Slightly sweetish, fruity-herbal aroma of blueberry, lemongrass and some pine. Rather sour, very fruity and a bit herbal-grassy taste of blueberry, elderberry, lemongrass, pine and a touch of tea leaves, followed by a medium long, rather tart, minerally-dry and a little salty finish. Thin to medium body, rather astringent and a bit effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Quite nice, I dig the idea but I think its not really what its supposed to be. Its a refreshing fruited Gose, but what has this to do with a Lassi? Its tasty nevertheless, but like the mango version not really my thing. I guess it totally up to the way its served, the bottle version is apparently very different than the one from a slushy machine.","Hagen / Bonn, GERMANY","Zlotta"

När jag häller upp sista slatten är det knappt en tendens till jästfällning, men i botten på flaskan ligger som ett tjockt, mörkblått skikt som försvinner först när jag sköljt ut flaskan några gånger. Syrlig och funkigt höig doft som drar åt svarta vinbär, blåbär och nästan lite körsbär. Både söta och friskt syrliga toner med stor bärighet. Kroppen är medelstor åt det något lättare hållet, med en ganska torr känsla och en syrlighet som får kinderna att strama åt. Smakmässigt en stor syrlighet som även ger ett litet utrymme åt det fruktigare bärtonerna. Smakar frisk och syrlig svarta vinbärssaft och lemonad med tydligt inslag av citronkoncentrat. Blåbär, torkade blåbär, med toner från blött hö. Smakar en del som fruktläder jag gjorde för längesen av blåbär, honung och pressad lime.
