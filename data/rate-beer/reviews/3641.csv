3641,"2016-06-14",3.6,"Bottle from Appellation Wines. 
Appearance - amber with a decent head. 
Nose - red and orange fruit. A touch ofshortbread. 
Taste - light red fruit and very faint biscuit. 
Palate - light to medium bodied with a creamy texture and a long dry finish. 
Overall - I think this is an amber ale. Its tasty. A bitter would have more biscuit notes. But its very enjoyable.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","AshtonMcCobb"

3641,"2012-04-06",3.5,"Bottle. Just as mentioned in previous comments, far too carbonated. Didnt stop foaming. When things died down, I was left with a nice looking unclear amber beer with a white head. Slightly buttery nose. Great flavour. Lovely grassy hops. Caramel. Bitter finish. Bone dry. Very good.","CZECH REPUBLIC","TheCametron"
3641,"2011-08-24",2.7,"Glad I was warned about the carbonation before I opened this gusher! I must have poured at least a third of this before the foam stopped pouring out of the bottle. Pours a cloudy golden colour with chunks of yeast that settle out. Settles to quite a decent pillowy beige head after the initial rush. Aroma of caramel and yeast. Similar flavours with some barley and treacle. Nice grassy finish. Quite a decent beer, just needs care when opening! Could do with halving the priming sugar.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","Benjii"

3641,"2011-08-07",3.6,"[500ml bottle, Cornelius Beer&Wine, Edinburgh] Gusher - erupted on opening. After salvaging what I could, was left with an opaque brown liquid with a thin head. Caramel, malty aromas, together with a bit of yeast on the nose from the volcanic opening. Gentle malty palate, with a touch of caramel sweetness. Toffee and brown sugar on the finish  sweet but not overly so, with a yeasty note that carried the smoothness on into the finish. Really very, very nice indeed [07082011]","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","BeerCast_Rich"
