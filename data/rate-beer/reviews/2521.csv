2521,"2017-04-29",2.9,"230417. This beer is a drivers beer and at any 2.8% ABV I imagine that you would be able to have a few without feeling any effects. While it may not be the most appealing beer to the eye it makes up for it in flavour with a fruit aftertaste that stays a while. Thin bodied and a little watery but overall not too bad.
