4392,"2014-07-18",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Raisins and toasted bread crumbs thrive within a pillowy texture, as a citrusy angles and a bitter herbal touch conclude this memorable dark lager.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam sits atop the brown-edged blackness.
-The mouthfeel is creamy yet not sweet or heavy. 
-This is not a lagered Porter recipe, thankfully.
-The flavour profile is balanced.
-This is far from linear, contrary to most dark lagers on the market.

4392,"2014-05-25",3.5,"Bottle in Italy. It says on the bottle ¬íblacker than the blackest black¬í, but it¬ís more like a dark brown pour.

Interesting brew.","Den Haag, NETHERLANDS","Vaiz"
4392,"2014-05-20",4.1,"330 ml bottle served in a goblett glass. Dark brown, can¬ít see through it, with a nice, ""marshmallowy"" and persistent light beige head. Powerful and rich aroma, very very hoppy (mainly citrus and pine), slightly roasted with notes of coffee powder, light toasted malts and roots/earth. It does smell way more like an BIPA than a Schwarz, wich I personally don¬ít mind. Liquid espresso coffee during the first sip, smooth and velvety, moderately sweet upfront, preceding a nice, citrusy and resinous bitterness. Solid malty backbone, even though it¬ís so easy to drink and slightly watery as it should be. Lingering chocolaty and hoppy aftertaste. By no means a traditional dark lager, but a pretty damn tasty experiment!","Rome / Lecce, ITALY","Ragnampiza"

4392,"2014-03-10",3.8,"Una bella dark lager. Di colore granato scuro, quasi nera con una buona schiuma pannosa. Al naso gli odori erbacei del luppolo tostato le conferiscono un odore alternativo alle sorelle Black ipa, forse pi√π intrigante, anche se pu√≤ apparire come una trovata commerciale. In bocca la tostatura dei malti si sposa bene con il floreale e l¬íerbaceo del luppolo che comunque gioca un ruolo di primo piano. Il fatto che sia una bassa fermentazione le conferisce a mio parere quel tocco di secchezza in pi√π che aiuta facendo in modo che non risulti alla lunga stancante.","Firenze, ITALY","TommyFi"
