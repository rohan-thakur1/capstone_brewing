1435,"2013-03-13",3.0,"Pours dark chestnut brown with a 2 finger, creamy tan head. Aroma of sweet grain, nutty toffee, floral hops, light pine and earthy, fruity notes. Flavor is full of cereal, toffee and booze, a little chocolate and floral and pine hops to the finish. As it warms it oddly becomes a little less boozy. Medium and creamy feel on entry that immediately drys and thins for a somewhat astringent dry and oddly acidic, slightly metallic finish. Decent overall, a litttle boozy and dry.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

1435,"2012-11-28",3.1,"Dark brown pour with red/brown hue,kind of like a beer bottle.

There could be a dark roasted malt astrignecy with the bitter as well.

1435,"2012-10-19",3.6,"Purchased at Binnys in Chicago, IL; enjoyed on a Friday night before heading out of the country next weekend.  Appearance is a very, very dark brown with a thin white head that rims around the glass, moderate thickness.  Aroma is mostly malty but also a bit faint, slight bit of sweetness/toffee.  Taste is interesting, notes of chocolate malt, bit of caramel, bit of plum, its complex but also faint, as Im not getting a ton out of the flavor, but it still goes down pretty nicely.

1435,"2008-08-10",3.9,"Bomber from Armanetti’s on Lincoln, Chicago.  I thought that this was originally just going to be a one off but judging by the most recent ratings it looks like this is the second batch they have done of it.

Sweet, boozy vanilla upfront in the flavor with bread and nuttiness, also mollases, perfume and some smoke.  Medium body with nice carbonation.  This beer is better than I remembered and might be one of the better ones that they have done, that being said though the flavor is a little too boozy and perfumey for me and the body could be a little fuller or atleast could have some more creaminess to round it out.","Grand Rapids/Chicago, Michigan, USA","xnoxhatex"

Some clingy lace was left around the glass.  The aroma of the beer was made up of toasted caramel, light chocolate, brown sugar, and some fruit.  The flavor consisted of bittersweet chocolate, lightly bitter roasted malts, caramelized sugar, dark fruits, and a bit of alcohol.  The mouthfeel was medium to full-bodied with minimal carbonation.  Different and a little unusual.  Way over the top for the style, but thats what the brewer intended.","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"

1435,"2007-12-10",3.1,"Bomber.  Poured clear, garnety brown with a short-lived cap of beige head.  My first impression from the aroma was a sour, vinegary note.. not pervasive, but unsettling nevertheless.. caramels and dark fruits provided a sweet base, accented by some herbal and metallic notes.  Tart darker fruits and light metallic notes tingle the tip of the tongue with drawn caramel and semi-sweet chocolates rolling over the middle of the mouth.. chocolate and caramel sweetness plus mild herbal bitterness are marred slightly by the sour notes on the finish.. but Im gonna ignore that for the most part in my score.  Medium-bodied on the palate with a nice drawn malty sweetness throughout.. its hard to ignore the sour off-notes at the finish.. its a bummer that this degraded as much as it did in less than a year.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

1435,"2007-09-18",3.2,"Bottle.  Faintly sweetish roast aroma with deeply-embedded red fruit and a sooth, mild funk from the hops.  Some Bockish notes but a bit earthier.  Very dark mahogany red, color only determined by exposure to light; head is soapy and bubbly and lightly tanned.  Very malty taste, medially bitter (but very dry and slightly more bitter in the aftertaste - sweetness isnt cranked up enough to balance) with that fruit and a few splashes of perfume.  Definitely not your normal Alt, hops and malt are probably doubled in the recipe, citrus and a touch of grapefruit to boot.  Medium body.  Struggles to find its own character - would easily fit into our catch-all American Strong Ale category.  Does not rattle my world, but enjoyable enough.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

1435,"2007-06-27",4.1,"22 oz bomber poured into a small goblet glass. Pours very dark brown with a small head.  Aroma is just amazing, first I get strong chocolate brownie, straight up, not exaggerating.  Then combine that with a straight laced (but stronger) no thrills German malt sweetness thats wrapped around some light esters.  And searching beneath that there is even a light earthy, floral hop presence.  Toasted aspect all around the aroma.  Taste definitely has an American twist on the Alt with a strong hop profile, though definitely German floral hops.  Then there is a lightly sweetened with chocolate cereal (think chocolate chex).  Just a feeling of alcohol, nothing strong but as you drink you definitely feel its a beer yet nothing aversive comes out of it.  Finishes very light and understated. Low bitterness and extremely quaffable.  So surprising how drinkable this is. Feels like I could drink this forever.

1435,"2007-05-24",3.5,"Pours a dark brownish red with a light brown (though somehow not tan) head that gave way quickly.  The nose is toasty (which I dont generaly like).  A big toasted malt sweetness with a big chocolate tinge to it.  A bit of caramel.  Somewhat creamy.  A rather sweet, though not overbearing malt backbone on this beer.  Again rather toasty, but not unclean.  Chocolate again noticeable.  a bit of alcohol in the taste, though thats not necessarily a bad thing.  Something a tiny touch milky or lactic, though perhaps thats just a smidge of roast I taste.    Some floral hops and a touch of diacetyl in the finish giving way to a toast, caramel aftertaste.  Not a bad beer, tastes like a slightly cleaner Double Bag.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"
1435,"2007-05-22",3.3,"22oz bottle.  Very dark for an altbier, dark brown and reddish in color.  Toast colored brown head.  Pretty nice nose, with lots of maple and red apple scents, lightly hoppy, lightly doughy, almost a bread crust and toast smell.  Wet and lightly sweet up front, more coarse with toasted grains and lighter maple in the back, finishes slightly dry over the back.  Good, but lacking depth, and it’s more of a generic strong amber ale than an altbier.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Medium body with a satiny crisp carbonation. Taste adds some doppelbock character with dark fruits joining the red apple.

Hearty dark roast malt smell noticed from two feet away. Hearty, yes, thats how Id describe it. Lightly coffeed and toffeed. Chewy like caramel, but not as sweet. Bits of anise instead. Noble hops really keep sweetness in check, or else the higher alcohol means its finishing much drier.  Very earthy. Definitely no GHT here.

It pours a coffee brown with a very minimal head (less than a cm).  Aroma is light, pleasant, and toffee-ish.  Flavor is slightly sour and heavily caramel-y...more like a bock than I expected.  The sourness seems slightly off to me, and I must say that the mouthfeel is over-carbonated, which is odd given the small amount of head when I poured it.  This beer is also sticky in your mouth, which in my opinion is consistent with the style.  Still, I must say i was a bit disappointed with the flavor of this beer.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

Starts out a bit pedestrian, but as the palate adjusts and the beer warms there is a nice hop finish. This is an excellent beer; smooth but with a back bone of semi-sweet chocolate.

Fairly sweet nose with cherry-wood, caramel and a dark rye bread coming to mind. Woody malts and dark german breads come to mind in the first moments.

Two Brothers MemoriAle is clean and clear dark brown (nearly opaque) with a deanse, foamy, slowly diminishing tan/dark beige head that leaves average lacing.  The aroma is fruit malt and nutty with something darker lurking in the background (weak coffee).  The flavor is full of malt, nuts, some vague coffee/chocolate, and a touch of alcohol.  Roasted malt and a mild bitterness (spicy) last through the finish.  This beer has a medium body, a moderate level of carbonation, and is quite smooth on the palate.
