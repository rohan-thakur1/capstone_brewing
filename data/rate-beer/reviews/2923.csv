2923,"2016-01-12",3.8,"Bomber from Total Wine, Tampa.
Doré, léger voile, col blanc très effervescent et disparaissant vite, normal cest du cidre.
Arôme est très bien fruité, ample pomme, petit rétro biscuité, bourbon sur une pointe de vanille, retrouve un ajout organique du miel. Sherry perce assez bien.
Palais est bien effervescent, crisp, note de pomme finement acerbe mais renforcé par une douceur des différents casks. Note une impression de chair de pomme, râpeux en bouche et un agréable profil Bourbon. Côté Porto/Sherry ajoute cette sensation de caramélisé-grillé vin chaud.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
2923,"2015-11-10",3.7,"Hazed golden color with a quickly diminished head. Light aromas with apples, oak and bits of spiced rye. Flavor are abundant, with apples, rye, port, oak, light cinnamon, ad hint of alcohol. Semi dry finish with a bit of marzipan and agave. Not your mothers cider, more like your grandmothers cider (the grandmother who had a flask of whiskey in her apron).","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
2923,"2015-07-29",5.0,"Hands down best cider Ive ever had. Whats not to love great flavor great color and out of bounds taste and a smooth silky mouth feel. Best crispin product ever made.","Colfax, California, USA","Blackdog55"
2923,"2015-06-04",4.1,"22oz bottle. Pours an almost-clear pale orange with no head. Aroma is attention-grabbing. Fruity and sweet. Almost dessert-wine in character. Surprisingly clean in flavor, given the sweet aroma. Light candy finish and a touch of the barrel they resided in. Very impressive.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","shadey"
2923,"2015-05-20",3.1,"Bomber. Paler medium golden with no appreciable head. The aroma picked up a while lot of barrel, with bourbon and sherry leading.. rich apples beneath. The flavor found tart oak, sherry, and a touch of Port upfront, with meaty apples following.. mostly grape barrels on the finish. Medium-bodied with low carbonation.. too barrel-focused, but still tasty.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
2923,"2015-04-17",3.7,"Sample at the Jackie Os Staff Bottle Tasting Part 1 on 04/11/2015. This Cider pours a cloudy straw-gold color with a medium white head that evaporates steadily to a film. Short strings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of applies, oak and spices. Medium body with flavors of tart apples, oaky vanilla and sweet spices. The finish is fruity with a woody and apple aftertaste. Above average overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
2923,"2015-03-26",3.7,"Bottle. Pours gold with a thin head. Rich apple sweetness, vanilla, light bourbony sweetness, and some nice festive spices. Good stuff.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
2923,"2015-03-07",3.8,"Aroma is apples, mild bandaid and cinnamon. The flavor is Apples, fruit, slight bandaid, tropical fruit and a tart/slightly sweet finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
2923,"2015-02-18",3.2,"My wife was a big fan of this but I wasnt quite as taken with it. Cloudy and attractive appearance. Apple, vanilla, moderately sweet, a flavor like rum coming through, then a little bourbon and wood late. But I felt a little flat about the balance of flavors and the palate. Interesting but not compelling this time. Bottle.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
2923,"2015-02-18",3.9,"Bomber to snifter (shared with the Mrs.). Looks solid; a mildly cloudy pineapple with white head that steadily dissipates into thin lacing. Smells good; vanilla-forward with a nice balance of honey, apples, and a blend of barrels in the background. Tastes like it smells with a smooth medium-bodied mouthfeel. A great take on a cider.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
2923,"2015-02-13",4.0,"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the cider pours a cloudy gold color with a thin white head that didnt stay around very long. The aroma is very sweet, it smells like honey, sweet apples, vanilla, bourbon, pears, and sweet spices. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like sweet apples, honey, vanilla, oak, sweet spices (cinnamon), sherry, and a bit of pear. To me it seems like the honey, vanilla, sherry and sweet apple flavors are the strongest and tend to overpower the other flavors. With that being said, I think its a sweet and tasty cider! Mouthfeel/body is medium, its coating with a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was good, its definitely a sweeter tasting cider. I wouldnt mind buying this again!","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
2923,"2015-02-11",4.0,"Bottle. Cloudy, golden color. Aromas of Apple, brown sugar, bourbon, cherry, and grape with honey and cinnamon notes; very complex nose. Sweet Apple with slight tartness upfront. Bourbon noticeable in the finish. Excellent.

2923,"2015-02-02",3.8,"Had a cider fan buy a bottle of this for me. She was excited for me to try it. Im usually not much of a cider fan, but I have to say this one was decent. It reminded me of a chilled hot toddy. Good amount of apple cinnamon taste and actually a really nice blend of barrel tastes.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","kkleu357"
2923,"2015-01-29",3.9,"Clear pale yellow pour with a fleeting bubbly white head...mild haze. Aroma is a bit like an apple wine with hints of vanilla and spice...some wildflower honey notes. Flavor is slightly sweet and appley with great bourbon, vanilla and spice but also has nice very subtle lush dark fruits. Mouthfeel is light and the finish is slightly bourbony and appley fading to light oak.","The dub c, Pennsylvania, USA","reggiedunlop"
2923,"2015-01-24",3.8,"Bottle from FoBAB leftovers. Poured gold no head. Aroma of sweet apple pear cinnamon pie. Light carb med bod. Taste is mellow apple pie crust.","New York, New York, USA","charule"
2923,"2015-01-23",3.3,"Bottle from Total Wine.
Straw-yellow pour, lingering white bubbles around the edges of the glass. Powerful barrel nose overwhelms even the apple. Bourbon vanilla, but also lots and lots of wood, some wine. The flavors are quite sweet but the mouthfeel manages to stop short of sticky, leaving a cider that is almost quaffable. Again tons of barrel flavor, plenty of vanilla, sweetness above and beyond the apples. Apple as well, of course, like in a danish. This could have been absolutely amazing (with about 10% chance) or absolutely horrible (with about 60%) chance. Instead, its in the middle somewhere. Drinkable, enjoyable even, but ultimately a gimmick rather than a well crafted cider. Maybe early BA stouts were like this (heck, many current BA stouts are like this) but this one screams ""hey look at me, Im aged in a barrel"" rather than using the barrel aging to develop an integrated complexity.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2923,"2015-01-23",3.6,"(bottle - 22 oz) Cloudy gold with no head. Very sweet apple jam and honey aroma. Lots of different barrel notes when you first taste it. Tons of honey and vanilla with a lot of wood notes. Fades quickly and lightly sweet.","Henrietta, New York, USA","zach8270"
2923,"2015-01-11",3.8,"Refrigerated brown bomber poured into a white wine glass. Aroma is nice rich apple with some bourbon, medium body, low carbonation, and no lacing. Taste is rich apples, vanilla, honey, rye, and bourbon.  Complex this is a nice fall, spring, or winter sipper; not a summer session.","Charleston Area, West Virginia, USA","weihenweizen"
2923,"2014-12-22",3.8,"Bottle - Pours hazy golden with next to no head. Nose isnt strong, with apple, tart skin, caramel, a little bourbon, red grape, and a little whiskey. Taste is sweet apple, caramel, a little spice, light bourbon and whiskey, tart apple peel, and pear. Thin-bodied, slick, with medium carbonation.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
2923,"2014-12-18",4.0,"Owned by MC or not, this is THE most complex cider Ive ever had. With everything going on, the tart bite is taken off the apple, but it still imparts a fresh apple aroma and flavor. You can pick out just about every cask used, though bourbon, sherry and the honey and vanilla overperform the shiraz and rye just a little. Very well received from everyone, even bourbon and cider haters :)","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
2923,"2014-12-14",4.1,"From a bottle at fobab. Pours a clear orangey golden yellow. Aromas of sour apples, white wine, vanilla, bourbon. Taste is sweet with a slight bourbon heat. Was not expecting this to be as good as it was. Loving it.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Art"
2923,"2014-12-06",3.8,"This poured a hazy pale straw yellow with a white head. Aroma was of oak, wine character, light bourbon and apples. Flavor similar, very well mended, hard to pick out the individual barrels, but certainly contribute to complexity. A really nice experimental cider.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
2923,"2014-11-25",3.7,"Bomber from Beer Run, opened 10/30/14.Pours a hazy yellow with not much of a head. Aroma of dry apples, whiskey, rye, wood, citrus, vanilla.

2923,"2014-11-14",3.6,"Bottle. Pours a cloudy amber, with no head, and somewhat light aroma of vanilla and apples in balance. Flavor is lighter than expected, leaning dry, with light cider, and an interest but very subtle vanilla and maybe cask flavors. A bit thin on the palate. Not as complex as I would like. Nice, but was hoping for a little more.","Bothell, Washington, USA","michaelinwa"
2923,"2014-11-10",3.5,"Applejack nose, bourbon and apple. Opaque amber, abundant carbonation visible. Bourbon and applesauce flavor, the bourbon fades. Light body. I dont like bourbon, but it goes well with cider.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
2923,"2014-10-26",3.8,"sample from bottle at 2014 houston big brew fest. Sweet apples with bourbon, vanilla and butterscotch. Quite complex, and somehow the intense sweetness isnt overwhelming.

2923,"2014-10-24",3.9,"Bomber from Total Wine in Sacramento, CA. Pours a hazy perry/cider mixed color. Aroma is woody and apple. Maybe a bourbon hint. Med body. Theres wood, mixed flavors, including a touch of bourbon, and perhaps some rye spice. Complicated, but its not overdone. Gets just a hint of tart/wood towards the finish. Really quite nice, finishing towards dry.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

2923,"2014-10-07",4.0,"Appearance is cloudy yellowish-orange. Aroma is almost straight bourbon, which is killer. Taste is a mix of sweet from the sherry, fruity from the port and dry from the shiraz, all underscored by decent oakiness. The finish is dominated by the rye whiskey, bourbon, and more oak. A very good, unique cider, with an interesting harmony of flavors.","Kennesaw, Georgia, USA","LeRoytheAlien"
2923,"2014-09-29",4.3,"This cider is very, very good. Crispin has a history of being generally dry, but this special edition Steel Town is incredibly smooth, shockingly sweet without being overwhelming at all, and has a very unique creaminess to it. There is an after-taste of vanilla which is impressively tasty. Very fine cider.","","Freakwerks"
2923,"2014-09-27",3.6,"Hazy golden yellow. Smells like a barrelhouse, aromas of wood, earthy, fermented fruits. Slightly sweet slightly tart. Honey sweetness and vanilla. Finish is crisp and a bit sweet. Not noticeably boozy. Very nice for a cider.","Maryland, USA","Maxbier"
2923,"2014-09-24",4.7,"UPDATED: SEP 25, 2014 AR: You definitely smell the barrels, but they are a bit hard to pick out. Not sure if I could identify them all going in blind. The bourbon is hard to miss, as is the spice of the rye. The 3 wines are definitely noticeable in the fruitiness and tiny bit of astringency.
AP: Muddled dirty blonde, like straw.
T: Just phenomenal taste. Butterbean honey and vanilla are stamped on the front, but it doesnt say how they are used in the cider (added to the barrels or what). Ive had butterbean honey before and it is quite sweet, which you can taste here but downed down a lot. I dont get much vanilla, but it seems to bring a smoothness to it. The barrels arent noticed here as much as in the nose, but the bourbon is present towards the end of a sip.
P: Smooth as hell, almost velevety with a bit of fuzz. There is only the slightest wisp of carbonation.
O: All of their limited releases are phenomenal, degrees above their regular offerings (even the bombers). This might be my favorite one yet.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","gillagorilla"
