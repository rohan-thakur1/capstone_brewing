1252,"2017-05-14",4.1,"Taps opaque coffee with a thin light tan head. Aroma delivers roast malt, dark fruit and caramel tones. Bold flavor presents sweet fig and other dark fruit, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, and subtle woody hops. Mouthfeel has firm body, decent fizz, and a roasty and woody finish. Very nice!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
1252,"2017-03-04",3.8,"Draft at Cappys. Pours a dark cola brown color with a small beige head. The aroma has some roasted malt and dark chocolate with additional dark fruit. The flavor is roasted malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, almost as roasted as their imperial stout with better mouthfeel and body, just enough of the 10% to keep it interesting, works pretty well with this cool March afternoon.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
1252,"2017-02-23",3.8,"Draft. Poured hazy dark brown color with an average frothy tan head that lasted with good lacing. Good toasted dark malt and dark fruit aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth thick texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy sweet toasted flavor with a medium to heavy smooth dark sweet finish of moderate duration. Very good bock.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1252,"2017-01-07",3.9,"Pours the deepest mahogany into the glass, almost opaque, with the deepest of walnut-ruby fringes. The initial eggshell tan soapy head reduces to no lacing of which to speak. The nose is of cotton candy, candy circus peanuts, caramel and dates/figs. Flavors are of burnt toffee, toast, roasted caramel, banana, candied dates, toasted figs, mixed bakers and bittersweet dark chocolate bark, and finishes with a well-hidden alcohol intermingling with dark esters and bitter chocolates. The palate is indeed extremely smooth for the ABV, lagered appropriately for the style (and intent). A light diacetyl note creeps up at the very end of the pull, providing a full-bodied, substantial and complex palate, with a reminder of the dangerous ABV hidden ever-so-well in this smooth Doppelbock. One of the best Hi-Wire brews to date, for sure!","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"
1252,"2017-01-01",3.7,"On tap, International Cafe North Myrtle Beach. Smooth chocolaty doppel, clean, well-made. The alcohol comes across pretty clearly, but at 10%, not surprising. Surprisingly easy to drink with the balanced bitterness, dark malts and aroma. Chocolate, dark stewed fruits, some coffee.  Bravo Highwire, not German in taste, and a bit high alcohol, but a well-made, first class effort.","Radford, Virginia, USA","EKGoldings"
1252,"2016-12-21",3.2,"Pour is a near black with a small tan head. Aroma is really not much. Some sugary malts with a hint of dark fruit. Flavor is sweet malt with again a ever so slight dark fruit . Some roast malt and alcohol follow up after the swallow. This was way sweeter than I would like a dopplebock to be. It was ok not great.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
1252,"2016-12-06",3.9,"Pours a deep, dark ruby-amber with quick white lacing. Nose is thin with a little caramel and European hops. Flavor is much richer with a nice burst of brown sugar and dark fruits with subtle smoke and star anise. Carbonation is deceptively sharp. Finish is sticky and a little spicy. Warm but not boozy. Quite good.","Georgia, USA","kingaugusta"
1252,"2016-11-23",4.0,"Draft. Clear deep brown color, almost opaque, beige head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of burnt caramel, cocoa, dark fruit. Taste is sweet, boozy fig, date, caramel. Very tasty.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
1252,"2016-03-17",4.2,"On tap at Hi-wire. Nearly black with thin brown head. Aroma of roasted malts, with plums and ""lager"". Taste is great. Coffee and chocolate and dark fruits. Sweet but not overwhelmingly so. My favorite Ive tried from these guys so far.","Waterloo, Ontario, CANADA","kevinsenn"
1252,"2015-12-28",3.5,"12 oz. Hazy mahogany brew with a thin creamy topping of bubbles. Nose is chocolate mocha, dry grass, booze, toasted nut and cardboard. Flavors of chocolate mocha, soy, dried grass, iron, scorched popcorn and earthy potatoes. Medium-heavy body has a smooth medium carbonation and a nice balance.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
1252,"2015-12-07",3.6,"Very smooth. Great flavor but a bit of aharsh and bitter finish or I would rate it a lot higher.","Virginia, USA","bigben873"
1252,"2015-11-25",4.0,"Bottle. Oh my, this is a wonderful beer. Very dark brown, almost black. Nice head for a dopplebock. Aroma is darkly roasted grains, chocolate with very subtle fruity hints and ever so lightly boozey. Taste was really flavorful with light notes of fruit and nice chocolate.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","tnkw01"
