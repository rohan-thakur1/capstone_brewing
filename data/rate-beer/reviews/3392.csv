3392,"2017-06-18",4.0,"(375ml bottle from boxbeers.dk) Pours a slightly hazy ruby-brown with a quite large cream head that fades slowly leaving lace. Aroma of quite sour cherries, lots of wood, red wine vinegar, cherry pits, horseblanket Brett, lemon, spicebox, light caramel malt sweetness. Flavour of tart cherry, lemon, quite strongly woody, tangy astringent quality, some dusty yeast, light caramel sweetness, soft spice notes, maybe a touch of hard cheese. Finish is dry, low lingering fruity tartness, lots of oak. Light to medium bodied with smooth soft carbonation. The overall feeling does belie the relatively low ABV, but with that under consideration its a quite drinkable sour red.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

Not nearly as complex as any of the Rodenbachs or even a Duchesse. If this beer tasted anywhere near its aroma it would be world class, but as it stands it is an above average but crazy overpriced sour brown (a Rodenbach Grand Cru can be had for less than 1/3 the price).

3392,"2015-07-09",4.3,"375 ml bottle from Ammersin Centerstore, Brunn/Gebirge.
Dark copper body, with a medium, fizzy, dissipating, slightly pink head.
Wonderful, complex aroma of oak, wine, vanilla, berries, cherries, funk, some ripe fruits.
Taste is also delicious, indeed with poppy seed, funk, oak, wine, vanilla, sour berries and cherries, apples, overripe fruits, some vinegar.
Medium mouthfeel, with a fizzy carbonation.
Finishes smooth, sour, dry, a bit funky, with oak and fruit notes.

Clearly the best Sour Red/Brown Ive had so far, offering everything great from this style, but with the unique twist of the poppy seeds that works really well. Extra point for the low ABV compared to other world class beers of this style. Amazing stuff!","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"
3392,"2015-06-22",4.5,"3300th review! 375 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2015 vintage bottling. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big sour black cherry, cranberry, green apple, lemon, red grape, cider vinegar, caramel, toasted oak, hay, straw, peppercorn, musty funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of sour cherry, fruity/funky/spicy yeast, dark malt, and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big sour black cherry, cranberry, green apple, lemon, red grape, cider vinegar, caramel, toasted oak, hay, straw, peppercorn, musty funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity/acidic tartness and yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of black cherry, cranberry, green apple, lemon, red grape, cider vinegar, caramel, toasted oak, hay, straw, peppercorn, musty funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and balance of sour cherry, fruity/funky/spicy yeast, dark malt, and oak barrel flavors; with an pretty much perfect malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is incredible. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a world class Flanders red ale style. All around fantastic complexity and balance of sour cherry, fruity/funky/spicy yeast, dark malt, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink with the balanced acidity. An insanely amazing offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

3392,"2014-12-03",4.5,"May 4th, 2013 - Losy Abbeys Amerosa is a hard act to follow, but the Red Poppy steps up proudly. Like the previous brew, its got a deep, crimson glow, though more transparent and with a thinner head. My sample glasss head has already deflated, letting off a wonderful smell. Its sour and very similar to La Folie, but smoother, oilier, sleeker and even a little smug. The oily touch resembles the smell of cashew butter, and the tangy sweetness brings in the goopy sweet of agave syrup and the unique smell of tequila. A sweet, smooth succulent palate embraces the drinker. While low and dense, it is also quenching, with a barrel aged sourness and a custard richness. In many ways it is like a cream ale, but then on another sip it tastes like a beer-iified version of dulce de leech or sweeten condensed beer.

3392,"2014-06-28",4.2,"Cherryish, murky brown color with a decent head. Intense vinous aromas, along with ripe sour-cherries, which get covered up by a tart sourness and oakiness, giving a lot of character to the nose, resulting in a more-wine-than-beer impression, very intriguing melange.

Begins with a fantastic tart sourness, which strikes the palate from the very first moment. Comes along with a lively carbonation, leading to a refreshing fruit impression, as cherries become detectable. This taste gets mixed up with earthy, wooden oak in a very convincing way, while a sparkling wine impression still adds up with the gentle cherry sweetness, which tastes almost like marmelade. All ingredients are in fantastic balance to each other, the cherries to not dominate the palate, due to a very leathery oak presence, coated up by buttery malts. At the same time acidic sourness gives the cherries a zingy fruitiness, with results in a complex vinous body, containing hints of vinegar. Enjoyable, matured, mild cherries define the finish, supported by earth, soft malts. This beer has a great taste, which is defined by a complex, fantastic composition.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3392,"2014-03-29",3.7,"Vintage 2013 on draught at Publick House, 3/20/14 and bottle, drunk 3/29/14In both, the appearance is a dark, ruby/black cherry tinted brown beer with a smattering of beige head that shows poor retention. Good clarity.Definite sharp acetic tones produce some near acetone-like notes and certainly lend an aggressive feel to the nose. Oak character contributes tannins and plenty of vanilla and dry black pepper-like phenols. Cherries just seem to be left as an essence here, much like the Framboise, being completely attenuated. With warming and breathing, more lactic notes emerge, softening things somewhat. Traces of toffee and caramel add some pleasant sweet notes to all of this heavily dry, tart nose. Love the relatively low alcohol content though, and none of it shows through.Intensely sour and dry in the mouth. Phew, this is a lot of barrel tannin, acetic acid and very sharp malic acids from the cherries. The draught version hadnt been as far attenuated as the bottle, still having more soft malt notes to smooth out some of this intense acidity. I like the flavors going on, for the most part, but there isnt enough malt body or sweetness to balance this intensely sharp acetone-like character that lingers on the finish. I do like that the sourness/tartness is not really cherry-driven, however. Not just a glass of cherry juice. Very phenolic, dry and just a bit too unbalanced on the sour side, even for a sour addict such as myself.Interestingly enough, the draught version was not as bright and the sediment still in solution helped balance some of the sharpness/heavy tannin, and sure enough, pouring a little bit of sediment from the bottom of the bottle actually helped dull the sharpness without really comprimising the flavor. Good and still very drinkable on account of the dryness and low alcohol but Ive got to imagine this hasnt been their best vintage.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3392,"2012-09-11",4.0,"Aroma is a funky/barnyard/sour cherries extravaganza. A deep reddish copper pour with a lively but mostly diminishing tan head and no lacing. Tastes of tart sour cherries and barnyard yeast. The sour taste  grabs your tongue and shouts  ""I'M HERE! ENJOY!"" A bit of a sweet/sour aftertaste. Light bodied and high in carbonation. Crisp. Overall, this is an excellent sour ale.

2009 vintage.

The beer appears a crimson sunburst hue, with an eighth inch of head that quickly settles to a thin layer and holds. The aroma is fabulous, with funk, cherries, wild yeast, and oak. The taste follows suit, and makes my cheeks pucker in delight upon the first sip. Insanely good, I want to trade for more of this immediately. The finish contains a healthy dose of vinegar and acetic notes, but is no way harsh. Quite the opposite, I wish I had a growler of this. My new favorite Flanders Oud Bruin.

Super tart flavor, mildly acidic like lacto acidophilous yogurt, citrus rind, cherries again, nuts, subdued malts and caramelized brown sugar. Excellent hardwood characteristics: tannins, resin, vanilla, minor beneficial oxidation. Will pointed out it was headed toward that vaguely vinegary, soy saucy place, but it stopped just short.

Appearance: Pours a deep mahogany brown with cherry red highlights, a little bit of gold around the edges and a little bit of sediment floating around.Features a thick, bubbly light tan head which sticks around for a while. Decent lacing. 

Smell: Tart cherries, wine grape hulls, sweet oak and vinegar and a touch of funk.

Mouthfeel: Light-to-medium-bodied with a high amount of prickly carbonation. The tartness, while not really puckering, coats the mouth in a film - in a good way.

Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. This is very enjoyable. I just wish I had more.

Aroma- A nicely done aroma here! Sour/Tart attributes including cherries, oak, and a medium amount of funk comes and goes. Very sharp but appropriate for the style. 

Appearance- Pours a .5 finger head that dies quickly.  Has a deep red colored body with good clarity.  Leaves a good amount of suds behind. 

Flavor- A very oaked cherry taste starts this one off in the most subtle way.  The acidity isnt too overpowering but more easy going and sweet. Complexed and has a long, dry finish.  

Mouthfeel- Light Bodied, Lightest Carbonation to the point of almost a flat beer, and has a crisp finish on the palate. 

Overall Impression- Wow, what a treat. Not too sour or tart on the taste or mouthfeel but rather on the nose.  Enjoyed the subtle character, giving it more of sweet and profound cherry notes.  Will be looking for another bottle of this and hopefully going to age!","Ballwin, Missouri, USA","DConMan"

3392,"2012-03-18",4.4,"Have had this on tap a couple times at the brewery and recently at Downtown Johnny Browns.

Has a nice dark rose tint with a pinkish thin head. Looks fruity.

Hints of tart fruits, of course cherries, and a little sweet cranberry smell.

Upon first sip, I was hit with a great sour, tart oak sensation. Then dark cherries roll in and dance on the tongue with a little effervescence. Tastes like I was drinking out of a miniature oak barrel for a glass. Very tasty.

Mouthfeel is just right. Medium bodied with a perfect amount of carbonation.

Glad I can still find this on tap every once in awhile. Looking forward to the next bottle release.","San Diego, California, USA","cocoapuph"

3392,"2012-03-06",3.6,"From notes.  First reviewed 7/25/2011.  Poured from a 375 mL bottle into a tulip. 2010 Vintage. Thanks to readbaron for opening this with me.

This pours a hazy medium dark brown with a murky beet red tint that is more obvious at the edges. Although I started the pour gently, it took an aggressive pour right into the center of the glass to populate a foamy tan head with small but visible bubbles. The head fades at its leisure, eventually leaving a ring around the edge of the glass and a few spots of lace down the side.

The aroma is the strength of this beer. Although for a Flanders Red Ale I would normally expect the aroma and flavor to be quite similar, the nose on this is actually more complex than the flavor. Obvious tart cherries are the first entrant into my olfactory system, but as I adjust I sense some oak, balsamic vinegar, and a bit of cinnamon. With a few swirls of the glass, a vibrant funk rises into my nostrils, adding further complexity.

A blast of tart cherries assaults my tongue up front with just a touch of balsamic sweetness, more of a pure sour flavor than I am used to in a Flanders Red. Once my palate acquaints itself with the flavor, I get nuances of oak and red wine in the middle, but the flavor pretty much has one gear -- sour and cherry. This bottle has a year on it already, which I imagine has led to it being more sour than when it was fresh, and I cant help but wonder if it would get better with even more time to develop. 

The tartness up front causes my mouth to salivate profusely right away. There is no doubt that this has a strong vinegar character and a fairly acidic feel. Lots of tannins present at the end. The body is actually a bit lighter than I would expect from a beer of this style, with the carbonation falling into the abyss somewhere between creamy and crisp. A bit of creamy, relaxed carbonation would suit this a bit better. 

When the bottle was opened I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the aroma, only to be let down a little bit by the flavor. It was good, but nothing about this truly differentiated itself from other beers in the style. Why spend the effort to track this down and pay premium money for this when there are better options that are both cheaper and more readily available?","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"
3392,"2012-03-04",4.3,"2009 Bottling
Tasted on 3/4/12 from a 375mL corked and caged bottle obtained in a trade.  Pours a very dark, nearly opaque amber/mahogany with a very thin, bubbly beige head that slowly disappears, revealing a thin collar of lace.  The nose is really stellar, with a caramel maltiness that melds into a sour cherry aroma with hints of coconut, chocolate malt, vanilla, lemon acidity, and just a touch of balsamic vinegar and barnyard funk.  The flavor is quite nice, but doesnt quite live up to the nose, with more sour lemon and cherry, the caramel and chocolate malt dialed way back, but still the very nice touches of vanilla, coconut, barnyard and balsamic.  The body is light with a sticky tannic texture, light carbonation, and a very long finish that includes the sour notes, caramel and chocolate malt, but the oaky vanilla and coconut notes really shine through on the finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"

This is a very sour beer if you ask me.  With that said, its very tasty and is good fresh or aged.

The taste is similar to the aroma, but theres also some red grapes noticeable too.  Theres also a long lasting tart finish.

However, a slight bump or swirl again covers the top with a layer of head.  Lacing is equally an interesting phenomenon - thick but quick.  So the body is a little homely, but the head and lacing are top class.
The aroma is cherry from an arms length (45⁰) and like cough syrup and fruit cake with a lemon hint under the nose.  There is an earthy note like wine.
Tase is salty and sour.
Palate is airy like champagne.
This is a sour ale, and these dont appeal to me as much as I would hope to like them.  They remind me too much of a pop brew with a squeeze of lemon.  OK but not worth the $14 / 375ml bottle that I paid.","California, USA","yackery"

The flavor is very tart cherry and cranberry, which intensifies in its sourness on the finish.  As the beer warms, the oak comes out more, with log cabin on the finish.  Quite a nice sour, but I actually get more complexity out of the aroma than the flavor.  It is so sour that it kind of assaults your palate, and although it tastes very good it is almost one dimensional in its flavor.

Pretty heavy on the oak.  Odd peanut butter note too.  Plenty of sourness, but the woody bitterness is a tad off-putting.  Solid but rather rough-edged and not terribly exciting.

The flavor is similar but a bit overwhelmed by the high acidity; still cherry pits, some toasted oak, light brown sugar, some bretty funk, and wet earth.  The palate is light to medium, drying, somewhat silky, prickly initial liveliness, and a somewhat quenching acidity.  The finish is very quick, acidic, drying, and full of cherry pits.  Quite a lot going on for a 5% beer; very sour, very funky, and balanced by a bit of malt and oak presence.

Pours a rufous, rust-like reddish brown. A half-finger of head leaves some decent lacing.

Nose is of cherry vinegar, with minor oakiness. Vibrant berry presence. Tastes similar to a restrained version of RR Supplication for me. Theres a strong cherry presence, along with raspberries, vanilla, citrus, and a tart juiciness that reminds me of licking my fingers after picking blackberries.

A-pours an extremely cloudy lighter brown color with strong red hues shined next to light.  The head is rather thick and off white to light tan.

S-the nose has notes of balsamic up front, hints of green olives behind, there is a fair bit of dry oak giving way to a light touch of brett, light acidity and bits of sour cherries.

T-the taste has a stronger acidity and more balsamic, the oak is stronger and more present as the brett works in with the sour cherries.  There is some acetic acid towards the back that detracts from the brightness of the cherries.

M-lighter to medium body, slightly grainy on the palate and rather juicy throughout.  the finish is slightly undercarbonated and a little flabby also lacking the driness you would like to see with all the acidity.

D-this has some issues, the cherries are overshadowed by oak and acidity, notes of acetic acid in the finish and some random brett notes make this an overly sour slightly muddled beer.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"

3392,"2010-08-08",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
This powerful Sour Ale takes eloquent cherries into acetic acid for a long, sour and funky finish.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A thin ring of foam circles the cloudy dark mahogany.
-The flavor profile is much more intense than the nose, making this rather difficult to drink.
-Carbonation is very low, making drinkability even more of a challenge; this is a serious Sour Ale for aficionados only. Good thing I am one!
-The vinous finish is redolent of balsamic vinegar.
-This is not nearly as polished as their Cuvée de Tomme, for example.

Drinkability: For a tart sour and dry brew its fairly drinkable.

3392,"2010-05-21",4.3,"Brouwers Sour Ale Fest 10. Pours deep brown with red hue when held up to light. Small off white head initially, and quickly dies down to rest just above the surface. The nose is wonderful; sour cherries, balsamic vinegar, Brett, oak, and lemon. The taste is actually a relatively mild sour. Cherries attack your tongue and the oak aging coats your mouth with a slick but sticky Brett/lemon funk. The lactic acid burns your throat like vinegar but is very tolerable. This is an amazing sour ale. One to cellar for sure. Reminds me of RR Consecration but not in a bad way.","Washington, USA","waltersrj"

Great cherry flavor, only about halfway through did some of the less desirable brett notes come through, I can see why the bottles are winning some awards this year.  Chalky finish, vitamin C aftertaste, long harsh acidic backfire, I prefer the bottle to the draft and this is much better than the last vintage.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"
3392,"2010-04-26",4.6,"375 ml bottle poured into my snifter.

A- Body is a very murky light muddy brown color. Pours with an approximately 1 finger white head that pretty much subsides immediately. No lacing is left behind in the glass. Cloudiness is thick and dynamic and whirls about the beer with some white yeast particles visible at the bottom.

S-An acidic tartness is the highlight of the nose and the first to hit it. Below this is a complex balance of sweet molasses, earthy mustiness, oak, and cherries.

T- Much like the nose-a pleasant sour tartness hits the front of the tongue immediately. There is a lot going on here as the cherry and oak become present underneath this and funky yeast comes through as well. The oak and cherries come through a bit more for the finish but a fantastic balance and complexity is still there. What lingers is a faint presence of the whole flavor.

P-Well carbonated and a smooth yeasty, velvety body.

O-This beer is awesome. I love it. Its a bit pricey; but well worth it (if I lived somewhere where it were available). My first of the special Lost Abbey Releases and it makes me want to find and try more of them. Very well done and perfectly drinkable.

Nose is cherries and hint of lactic acid tart, hints of oaky wood and vanilla, light spices and something akin to cocoa.

3392,"2009-11-23",3.7,"A strangely looking murky reddish brown color with a minimal tanned head that quickly fades away to a small ring of lacings.

The smell is of tart cherry notes and an interesting mix of bretty funk and oak barrels. The barrel notes are more prominent than expected. Hints of other fruity notes and caramel reminiscent of an Oud bruin. An interesting and to large extent good smell, but its not excellent.

The taste is actually quite acidic with sour cherry notes from start to finish. Some complementary caramel-like sweetness. Notes of wood and oak barrels. Mild funky notes and notes of berries. The finish is tart with notes of brett and cherries and a hint of minerals. After a while, the acidity mellows out a bit, letting more sweetness come through.

The body is quite light, too light I think. The carbonation is slightly too mellow, I would have liked it to be a little livelier and sparkling.

A good beer, but not fantastic. Ive come across many comments about this one comparing it to a lambic, but too me, it is more of a sour, fruit-infused Oud bruin than a fruit lambic. Its not as complex as some of the better comparable Belgians, but still a very impressive beer. Nice bland of tartness, barrel character and fruit flavors.

S - smells of cherries and esters

T&M - pretty outstanding, Ive had quit a few wild ales from Jolly Pumpkin Brewery. This beer is not as sour as those beers, but I think that compared to 90% of those beers this one is easier to drink. Tastes of sour cherries, very smooth on the mouth.

Almost a sour patch kid sort of puckeriness on first sip that you get slightly used to as you get through your drink.

Pours hazy deep red with a small, frothy, off-white head that actually stays for quite a bit. Lovely tart aroma. Cherries, oak, peach, apples, caramel sweetness as well. Medium carbonation, lovely frothy and creamy mouthfeel. Flavour is very elegant, lots of oak, caramel, some sweetness, cherries, raspberries, red apples. Long, lingering tartness. There are notes of sherry, toffee, flowers, vanilla, raisins. Really lovely. Reminds me of Rodenback Grand Cru, actually. Mostly in its ability to impress simply because it is so elegant and subdued.

It pours a cloudy orangish-brown with lots of sediment and a small off-whitr head.  The flavor starts with a quick dose of sweet cherry and faint yeastiness.

Flavor starts incredibly mild, much like Phunky Duck.  When the flavors do show themselves, it balances strong oaky, vanilla notes with a back-end vinegar and dark dried fruit.  Very balanced, contemplative.  Id like to sit on the porch on a cold day, sipping and thinking about this one. 3.9.
update, 2009 bottle on 6/2/10:  Better than the first time for sure.  Pours dark amber-brown, frothy small creamy tan head.  Nice pop to the cork upon opening.  Aroma is a creamy blend of vanilla, tart cherry, green strawberries, lemon lime, straw-funk.  Very deep.  Flavor starts with a very balanced cherry-led punch, then mellows and diversifies with a brilliant array of almond, almond-float, syranam cherries, oak.  Finish gains slightly in acidity (acetic and lactic), but it is all so well integrated.  I love the heightened acidity to this bottle, to me it rounds the almond-oak flavor more than younger versions.  Loved it.) 4.4.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"
3392,"2009-09-28",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 30, 2009 2009 bottle from TheEpeeist. Thanks, Chris! Pours a dark rusty murky hue, red and brown mesh well, as light hits the edges, a small offwhite head that dies to a tiny film that clings to the edges, minimal lacing. Aromas are a nice melange of sour and sweet cherries, French oak and brett, a touch of vanilla, vinegar, and a pretty nice sourness, aromas present across the room with caramel malts buried underneath. Initial is lighter medium on the palate, light carbonation, a good sourness, nothing overbearing, sour cherries and a touch lemon, wet wood, faint vanilla, and a bit of acidic vinegar feel. That stays on the backend, coats the mouth well. This is a beer I could drink a lot of, but could use more body and frankly Im just a touch dissapointed it doesnt. I guess for 5 percent abv, this isnt meant to be heavy, instead a lighter quite quaffable sour. A bit more carbonation (I know, I know.. Same old argument.. But really!) Could go a long way!

3392,"2009-09-01",3.6,"2008 edition: Rusty mahogany. Vigorous poor yields a small tiny-bubbled head. Acetic acid, prune, port-steeped raisin aromas with subtle notes of iron, oak, almond (cherry pits), minerals, and leather. Minor oxidation (sherry). Soft prickles of loose carbonation. Soft and well-rounded, initially, with a tart and juicy interplay of lactic and acetic acid. Oak exercises restraint as while uniting with the brisk mineralic twinge which absorbs much of the resounding juiciness. Snug oak-derived tannins contribute faint vanilla, though the wood acts merely as a platform so as to highlight rather than pummel the lustrous fruit character. Malt is dry, though virtually nonexistent. Cherries showcase immense depth, all the way from the slick texture of the skin and the succulent flesh, on down to the light almondy character extracted from the pit. Finishes raspy with iron along with a brush of oaken dryness yet still slick and fairly moist with lingering cherry skin and acetic acid. While I certainly enjoy the juicy lactic and acetic notes, Id love to see those particular characters complemented by some phenolic/Brett action. Nicely structured, as well, though more a *bit* more dryness would help. Pretty good stuff.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Tons of cherry, burnt caramelized banana, dark fruit, caramel and marzipan.

3392,"2009-05-29",3.9,"I couldve swore that Id rated this before. Sampled a 2008 and 2009 thanks to rustychiles. Initially, the 2008 is much more interesting to me, where I find far more different flavors, particularly a nice chocolate/cherry pairing that I liked, compared to the newer 2009 that just tasted sour. However, as I drank more of both, that same chocolatey quality in the 2008 really glued itself to my palate, became a hinderance to all other tastes, and got quite annoying. However, as I sampled more of the 2009, I began to really appreciate the depth of flavor in the sourness with some nice cherry to back it up. Definitely not a melt-your-face-off sour like a Cantillon either, I could still taste other parts of the beer and appreciate it. A great offering from the Lost Abbey, and Im quite happy that I ponied up the money for 4 bottles from this year.

I was expecting a very funky sour, but instead was met by a ton of fresh fruit like sour cherries, dried apricot, and a hint of funk.  I found it to be a bit thin and unbalanced.

3392,"2009-05-04",4.0,"2009 bottle from Perrys in Livermore--I believe they charged me at over $30 for this 12.7oz bottle.  Clear light brown with a thick ring of beige bubbles for a head and a tiny film--looks pretty flat.  Agitation does render a 1/2 finger fine beige head, though still has relatively low retention.  Pretty strong aroma of sour dark cherry skin and flesh, as well as a bit of lemon pulp.  Dry oak and vanilla in the backend.  This reminds me (though slightly) of cherry yogurt, though definitely more sour.  Flavor adds some dark caramel and earthy notes. Still plenty sour--6/10.  The finish is dry, yet the sourness turns my salivary glands on high.  Light carbonation with a light to medium body.  A very tasty beer, especially considering all the animosity towards LA lately.  I dunno what they charged for it at the Lost Abbey, but at Perrys, this beer would have been well over $60 for a 750--highway robbery, that is.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

Lambic nose with lots of citrus, mango, and cherry, also something odd, an earthy meat note. Loads of fruit in the flavor, really terrific blend, and not quite as tart . Theres still an odd note though, a really bitter spice and semi-rotting, and it comes through more here than the flavor. Very dry palate, moderately carbonated. Like this a lot.

As it is, this is a less-complex lambic, and as much fruit as there is, it could use more. 847416After several other bottles, not nearly as impressed. muddy red with a frothy tan head.

Aroma is tart cherry skin, rice wine vinegar, and a light naturally sweetened grape juice.  Flavor is lemon zest, sour unripened cherries, and acidic citrus.  This beer didnt absorb much, if not any, of the oak barrels...would have benefited from the wood influence in terms of added complexity.  A little funk to accompany the sour would have been welcomed also.  Pretty descent mouthfeel due, in large part, to ample carbonation.  Good beer.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"

This is probably the first brew of this type where I can actually detect cherry aroma and not just straight acid or funk.  Very nice.  Palate is medium thin with just a little bit of carbonation.  Flavor is mouth puckering, sour, sour cherry, oak, acid, funky, and all around nice.  The only knock on this brew is the palate and the low levels of carbonation for the style.

3392,"2009-03-23",3.9,"375ml bottle - first installment from the 09 sinners club. Pours a reddish brown with no head - at least at first. A center pour from 12 inches resulted in zero, but after (literally) about 10 seconds, a wave of very tiny bubbles started to rise to the top. Formed a dense, but still thin layer of foam on top. Weird, weird pour. Cranberries, cherries, unripe blackberries and some light brown sugar in the aroma. Definitely give this one time to warm up a bit - the flavors really come out of hibernation. Almost completely flat - extremely little carbonation - which is very weird, given how effervescent Im used to sours being. Only if you hold it in your mouth does the tartness really show - otherwise its pretty faint. Cherry certainly comes out in the flavor, as well as the oak from the barrels, making it a little musty / funky. Its certainly good, and the bottle is beautiful... but Im a little disappointed with this one. Well see what a bit of age does with the other bottle.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

Taste: Sour cherries, oak barrel, a small taste of funky yeast, a little bit of cranberry-like bitterness and a subtle hint of spice in the finish.

Mouthfeel: Juicy and puckering.

Overall: A great adventure into the barrel itself. I really am able to pick out more flavors in this, than in Cuvee de Tomme. I know they are two completely different beers, but I think of them as cousins perhaps.  The level of wood presence is perfect, the sour cherries make for an enjoyable sip after sip drinking session.  I would imagine this would go with a meal or a chocolate based dessert.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"

Sourness is nice, not overwhelming at all.  Very, very drinkable.  Medium bodied and quite twangy mouthfeel. Finish is a nice lingering musty wood dryness.  Super tasty.

3392,"2009-02-02",3.7,"idk where this bottle came from but its been in my fridge for a year now (2008). muchas gracias to the soul who left it behind...
its been sitting so long that the cork bomb was no issue... dark orange brown color with no head and lots of clumpy yeast.
smells a bit like pickling spice/pickles or that strange funkiness that a lot of red burgundies get before they get a chance to open up... cinnamon, wet cement, fruity/cherry tart though not quite sour and malty sugars yet its very dry.
it tastes very green from young barrels and quite tannic. though im not sure whether the tannins dominate from the wood or cherry skins (it really doesnt matter)... also, faintly malty and oaky with a cinnamon-y brett-like stink on the finish which lingers on. medium body lacks a bit of richness. the mouth feel it is prickly and dry as it cleans the palate entirely.
not a whole bunch going on... seems as if something is missing. though, it is in no way a bad beer! 7/4/7/4/15/3.7","scottsdale über alles, Arizona, USA","hellbilly"

3392,"2009-01-19",4.8,"Wow. wow. wow.  I really, really like this beer.  I like Red Poppy, but I love double Red Poppy.  Is it because of recipe tweaks between 2008 and 2009?  Is it that the additional cherry juice lends additional sweetness?  A wonderful acetic tartness, which reminds me of balsamic vinegar.  Lots of cherry notes. Insanely drinkable.

One wonderful glass.Earlier Rating: 8/26/2007 Total Score: 4.5Tasted at Lost Abbey 1st Annual Barrel Tasting on 8/25/07.  Used to be named Le Woody Brune at Solano Beach Pizza Port.  4 barrels/100 cases were made, but wont be released until Spring?  Made in old 1997 red wine barrels with subdued oak characteristics.  4oz sample from barrel was flat and at room temperature:  need to re-rate when bottles are released in Spring.  I expect it to be better and more sour then.  Made with Dawn Patrol Dark as a base, and I think I heard it was blended with a barrel aged Amigo Lager.  Deep red color approaching black.  No head, which I would expect to reduce aroma, but still had a wonderful sour cherry aroma I could smell all day.  Made with Brettanomyces yeast, which is a super attenuator, so I expected the beer to be dry, but there is still a nice hint of sweetness. Mild pleasant sourness, that I think even sour haters would like.  Normally beers are better with cheese, but I like this beer by itself, because cheese over powers the wonderful flavors.  Extremely pleasant to drink.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"

3392,"2009-01-09",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2009 In short: A dirty and unusual not-so-sour brown ale.  Interesting
How: Bottle 375ml, consumed when about 1 year old (the aging I like to give to most sour ales).  Sent to me by my generous buddy WeeHeavySD.  Thanks a lot Jon!
The look: A small beige head over an ugly opaque dirty brown body with particles
In long: Nose is rather musty and not the nice funky-musty.  Taste improves a lot on the nose.  Very woody, but not typical sour-ale oak-like wood, more like the big mahogany wood used for classy furniture.  A lot of horse blanket.  The beer is also quite earthy.  Some red apples, some band-aids, some cherries, some chestnuts, some caramel.  Very musty but more pleasantly musty than the rotten musty nose.  Dirty yeast all over the place.  Actually this has to be the dirtiest sour(ish) ale Ive ever had. Sourness level is somewhat low for a Sour-Ale.  The beer is actually quite complex in the way it brings together a lot of flavour elements but it is also a bit all over the place.  This beer is very interesting in a thats pretty fucked-up kind of way.  This is like a classic flemish sour that has been dragged in the mud and then left in a smelly barnyard to dry.  A very good beer but not the what I was expecting, I think I should have drank this one fresher.  I wish I could go back in time to late 2007 and have it when it was fresh.  And sell my stock port-folio for treasury bonds while Im there.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Very prominent horse blanket/barnyard brettanomyces aromas with some acidic qualities and a very subtle, soft, sweet malt background with cherries, wood, and spice.  The aromatic qualities flow directly into the flavor.  There is more overt cherry flavor present and some more spice as well.  The oak aging really softens things out pleasantly integrating the bold flavor characteristics together well into a coherent flavor profile.  The body is light and delivers the many dimensions of this beer well as a straightforward presence in the mouth.  The alcohol is appropriately mild and hardly noticeable making this a refreshingly complex and funky drinking experience.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with just a slight acidity and great pinpoint carbonation.  Overall, this was quite good, but I can’t help but measure it by the yardstick of Russian River sours, and this one doesn’t quite measure up.

The taste leans more on the sour side with less of the sweetness and more of the funk.  The vinegar is more prevalent in the taste than the aroma though there was a bit of brown sugar underneath.

3392,"2008-10-17",3.7,"375ml bottle thanks to MrBendo.  Pours a muddy, extremely cloudy brown/orange with sediment floating around.  A small, bubbly white head half-assedly forms then disappears for the most part.  Aroma is highly acetic and fruity.  Sour cherries definitely evident among red wine vinegar-type aromas.  Nice, juicy cherry aroma.  This reminds me a lot of a JP La Roja, though a little more cherry flavor.  No funkiness or brett character displayed in the aroma (was this even brewed with Brett?).  Im digging this aroma though.  Some vanilla and oak, though subtle, are noted as the beer warms. Taste is a little watery up front that fades to a cherry juice middle and a quick, dry finish that doesnt stick around long.  The flavor is a disappointment compared to the aroma which promised things the taste did not deliver.  Sourness is pretty evident, the beer is even refreshing.  The beer is just a little too watery at this point, I dont know if it was better fresh or not.

This is going to be the November-December 2008 release of red poppy. As this beer was tapped well before its release it was somewhat under-carbonated. Color was a reddish-orange-brown with a no head. The aroma was complex with many sour fruits, sour cherries, raspberries, cranberries and oak. The taste was brilliantly sour, with the cherries taking center stage, complexities of malted grains, wood and sour grapes. The mouthfeel was light but satisfying. The finish was long and sour. Overall: The first sour of the tasting and what a way to start, this is one of the greats.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"

First thing that I notice is the unmistakeable aroma of sour cherries with some wet woodiness as well. Initially you get some good cheek sucking in moments, as the sourness of the cherries kicks in. There is slight diluted sweetness to soften the shapness of those cherries, some spikey vanilla and just a mere streak of jiffy lemon juice, lovely!","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"

I could have smelled this one all night and been perfectly happy.  Cider like aroma that leaves no doubt this is going to be a sour ale.  Sour fruit is easy to pick out, apple, pear and cherry.  Yum.  Sour fruit is the most obvious thing you get but the wood is right behind is and well blended.  The wood ultimately overpowers the fruit leaving the mouth feel drier than expected but ultimately that goes away leaving you with a wet refreshing finish.  Enjoyable all the way around.  The only thing that would have made this better in my opinion would be more fruit and less wood.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

Aroma of sour cherry and some nice woody earthiness.  The nose is not nearly as aggressive as I was suspecting.  Subdued, yet still very engaging. Funky, sour, really complex.   Taste tart, sour cherries.  Both elements of fresh cherries and musty old cherry are present, and nicely blended.  The cherry fruit is dominant early, then gives way to the wood and earthiness.  The aftertaste has some black pepper spiciness that sort of came out of nowhere.  The funk is muted in the taste.  As this warms, it takes on a cherry juice taste and loses most of the funk.

3392,"2008-04-13",4.3,"Reddened mahogany and very hazy pour; an off white crown leaves a skirting ring around the edge rather quickly.  Soft cherry and funky balsamic aroma with dry aged cheeses, steamed artichoke, overripe citrus and bandaids.  Hanging back a bit, but altogether really interesting and strange; more multidimensional than it lets on.  Flavor is less so; more a perky, tart refreshment than it is confronting, sour bewilderment.  Red apples, red grapes and brown sugar intermingle the cherry pie and funk characters; theres a bit of chardonnay and what would be a pomegranate sangria effect happening as this touchy tartness lingers toward delicate fruity sweetness more often that it does toward firey sourness.  Likeable.  Sawdust, dry grass and some musty farmhouse like qualities in a mid palate that gives mostly buried flavors of peppery spices.  Medium palate is velvety and polished; the typical and appealing rough edge is mild here.  Finish pulses of lemon and cherry juice; fading amicably.  Not an unforgiving element to this example, which in others is sometimes stunning and other times fairly superfluous.  Here, it makes for a winning character of restraint in this most friendly of sours.  Thanks, Andy!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

3392,"2008-04-06",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 2, 2009 Original Rating: 750ml bottle generously shared by bockyhorsey on a beautiful 80-85F day in phoenix. Poured a murky red-brown with plenty of chunks and cherry bits floating around (bill had to remove one in his glass that was the skin of about half of a cherry!). Aroma was wonderful leathery funky tart cherries. The flavor followed suit, gentle and smooth in flavor and mouthfeel, not harsh, yet assertively sour. Finished with a bit of a spice bite, created at least by the high attenuation and acidity, presumably no real spicing? A very nice brew, although Ill take the CdT over this - such decisions I wish I could actually be forced to make in life. Thanks, Bill! Re-rate, bottle from Swolf or Gabe as beer number six in a killer July 09 Super Secret Sour State Line Tasting (SSSSLT) featuring (first to last by my counts): Supplication, Consecration, La Folie, Dissident, Cuvee de Castleton, Red Poppy, Lambic de Hill, Festina Lente, Panil. Cherries are the forte here, oaky and only softly tart, highly drinkable, not incredibly tart. Very inoffensive, gentle sourness and again, cherries. A nice brew.","","User37895"

The aroma hits you with vinegar and lots of aceto sourness.  Then there is some pity, musky cherry. The vinegar is original as well and its very nose-tickling.  Taste is not as ""crazy sour"" as the nose makes on think.  Bit its still nicely sour, with light acidity on the tail end. A short, light sweet cherry with \dry finish that doesnt stick around for long. Love the sourness, particularly in the nose.

Pours a rich warm red-accented brown in a most head. Lovely nose with tons going on: sour cherries, woody tannins, heavy funk mingling with prominent young oak.

Glorious, well-balanced flavor. Plenty of funk and lactic sourness, but never overwhelming, cut by the mild cherry and caramel sweetness, oak swirling around, leather through the middle and cherry pits on the far late end. Glorious mouthfeel, lightly sparkling, refreshing, never too sour so as to burn the sinuses, but consistently sour enough to pucker the mouth. 

This is an absolutely delightful sour ale, and the whole thing - rich flavors and endless complexity - is packed into 5.5% ABV which really is a heck of an accomplishment. I joined to sinners club for a shot at this beer --- and it was amply worth it. Wonderful.

2008 Bottle 2/25/2014 I didnt mean to let this one sit so very long without trying it, but oh well, here we are. Opens with the slightest puff, pours red-brown and near-to-flat. Really awesome nose: cherries, lemon, and latrine with balsamic Flemish-red elements in the back seat. Flavor of lemon juice and wood, goat cheese from the midpoint on, tannins, sour cherries cutting through unmistakable but never syrupy or sweet.
Im not sure this is quite as good as it was the first time around, but age has done little harm and perhaps mellowed some of the oak character. I agree with what I wrote before; this is a wonderful beer. Original rating stands.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

3392,"2008-03-23",3.9,"Pours a lightly hazy crimson red color.  A moderate, foamy tan head settles to a splotchy film with a prominent edge.  Minimal spotty lacing noted.  The aroma is a complex blend of sour cherries, tannic, vinous red grapes, mild lactic sourness, aggressive new oak, and some mild, Belgian barnyard funk.  Reading the review just before mine as I drink this, I can see how notes of leather would also come to mind.  Flavors are again based on sour cherries, with the new oak showing quite strong.  The lactic element subsides to the point where it is barely noticeable, while the barnyard funk intensifies to my liking.  Held in the mouth and rolled across the tongue, the sourness really kicks into high gear, bordering on mouth-puckering.  Medium bodied and well carbonated, the mouthfeel just lacks the silkyness that I was expecting.  Finishes dry and sour on the tongue, as it should.  This is a very good sour ale.  Is it worth the hefty pricetag and all the hype?  That is debatable.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
3392,"2008-03-23",3.7,"Thanks to toncatcher for this - split with my lady for Easter - a good beer for a holiday - very cloudy red beer, with somewhat low carbonation - aroma of sour cherries, and tannic and funky fruit skins - moderate earthy, leathery notes, some pretty well-developed brett character, and mild oak - oak is much more prominent in the flavor, and dominates the beer quite a bit - a nice cheesy, leathery, almost briny, lambic-like funkiness to it - moderate fruit acidity, and some not-quite-developed tannic character - some lacto character combines with the cherry and occasionally reminds me of yogurt - a bit of cranberry and fruit seeds - the oak and funk does seem to get in the way of any other complexity the base beer may have had, but this is still a pretty solid sour ale.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
3392,"2008-03-23",3.9,"Dark brown with minimal head. Very soft alluring nose of funky cherries and a mild tannic grapeskin note.

3392,"2008-03-21",3.7,"Pours with a frothy, initially one-finger thick, tan colored head.  The beer is a very dark, concentrated cherry color, but shows an almost brilliantly clear, ruby-red color when held up to the light.  The aroma is sour and funky; aromas of over-ripe cheese, lactic acid notes, a touch of an acetic edge and funky / woody mushroom notes.  Underneath this initial funk is a noticeable fruit character that provides characteristic cherry aromas, but also a touch of cranberry and some sour plum.  The aroma is on the sharp side as it seems just a touch too funky, if that makes sense; at first it seems that the beer is a little too wild even compared to a Lambic, though actually now that I think of it, a lot of this sharp character is a mix of the funkiness and a substantial oak character.  The oak contributes bourbon-like spiciness, buttery-oak aromatics and a touch of vanillin, each of which seem to clash a bit with the up front funk.

Tart tasting, predominantly lactic, though there does seem to be a tart cherry contribution too.  The carbonation, while not wildly effervescent, provides enough zip to tickle the tongue as the beer runs down my throat.  The oak flavors are soft at first, but pick up steam as I take a few more sips; spicy wood and ample buttery oak pick up steam in the middle and into the finish were a touch of vanillin is also noticed.  Tannins & fruit contribute to a cherry skin flavor and texture up front as well as some bright, cherry flesh notes.  The cherries definitely add to the complexity of this brew, yet I wouldnt say this as a fruit beer necessarily; this beer doesnt scream cherry, instead the fruit is really well integrated with the other flavor components.  This is quite light and quaffable, the wood / tannis provides some texture to keep this from being anything near thin; the texture may in fact be tone of the best things about this beer.

While the oak is never overwhelming here, it does seem to get in the way of the funky-fermentation notes and the base, beer-ingredient driven flavors & complexities; I think about a quarter of the oak character would be perfect for this beer, keeping it nice and subtle and in more of a supporting role.  The buttery oak notes really seem to dominate the aroma of this brew after a bit, though I wouldnt say that it get over-whelming, it just does overwhelm all the other aromatic components.  Not bad, even quite good, but the dominant oak keeps it from being incredible for me, though I must admit that I love seeing all this flavor packed into a beer of only 5%abv.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Thanks to whomever popped this open just before we transitioned to Chriss house.  I wasnt really expecting to get to try so many Lost Abbey/Port brews in one shot so this was icing on the cake.  Its not the most intense sour ale.  I may still have problems finishing up a bottle alone but that wouldnt stop me from trying.
Aroma / Appearance - The cloudy reddish brown body gave off strawberries, raspberries and cherries.  This fruity barrage was undercut by a focused sourness which gave a very bright aspect to the aroma.
Flavor / Palate - The dryness hits the mouth soon after the first sip (much like La Folie).  Sour raspberries blend with strawberries and other fruits in a liquid form of sour patch kids.  For a sour ale it was easy going and light on the palate.  I could certainly take my time with this one and make an hour of it.  Lost Abbey has a winner on its hands with this release.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Theres a LOT of yeast on the bottom of this one.  I thought I was pouring slowly but still ended up with big yeast flakes.  Not that I mind, but it was a bit much when I actually plucked a huge glob of yeast off the top of the liquid in my glass.  It looked good until that happened in the 2nd half of my pour.  Anyway, it smells of wild yeast and tart cherries.  The flavor is led by that wild yeast with some malt presence and quite mild cherries.  Theres a hint of oak character that I noticed mostly in the finish.  I actually found the body just a little on the watery side even after letting it warm.  It finishes dry.  Is it good?  Yep.

The flavor is particularly tart and sour with a thin and low profile of cherry.

From the Sinners club. 4 of us split a membership, and are paying a crapload of money to get these beers to Florida, so this better be worth it. Pours out a combo of red and purple, sort of looks like a bruised piece of fleshy citrus fruit. Small head, light brown, about 1/2 finger thick. Some retention and spot lacing. The nose is wonderful, and the best part of this beer. I spent a good 20 minutes smelling it and taking everything in before I ever took a sip. Sour ripe cherries, cherry pie filling, balsamic vinegar, wood and oak notes and some nice earthiness. Tastes very good as well, maybe a bit less enjoyable than the aroma, but we are just picking nits here, and its more to do with the fact this smells so damn good than any fault of the flavor. Sour cherry mash, cherry candy and pie filling, oak, musty earth and balsamic vinegar again all make a showing. Not sure if any Brett was used in this beer, because the sourness comes more from the cherries and the vinegar notes to me, but I could be off there. Medium bodied, slightly sticky, clings to the tongue. Average carbonation but overall this is very fun to drink, and very satisying as well. Long finish, full of the cherries and vinegar, and always keeping that earthiness and woody notes. I want more, now.

3392,"2008-02-25",4.0,"Sampled from 12.7-oz bottle and shared by Brewfiend. Pours a hazy reddish/brown amber brew with a fast dissolving and fizzy off-white head that dissipates to a thin film and ring. Aroma of subdued yeast funk, dark cherries, some red licorice, tart apples and a touch of oak wood. Taste is medium bodied, some carbonation with a slight metallic tart cherry apple flavor with some additional sour and dark fruits. Finish is mildly sour with a light tart cherry aftertaste with some yeast. The oak barrel aging does some nice work on this sour ale.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"

Dont really get Le Woody out of this brew...but then again the Le Woody I had was a few years into age.  Never the less this was a quality brew.  Some oak and cherry in the aroma mixed with some toasted biscuit maltiness along with a little yeast and nuttiness.  The flavor had a little funk mixed nicely with some cherry.  Not really lots of acetic cherry or tartness that I was expecting or hoping for in this brew.  Instead it was a nicely balanced and very smooth softer sour cherry ale.

3392,"2008-02-24",4.2,"Appearance: Pours a hazy, reddish-brown body with a small, short-lived white head.

Smell: Bright, funky aroma of wine-macerated cherries and planks of toasted oak.

Taste: Whoa! Tart, juicy, lightly acidic cherry flavor at the forefront with hints of the sweet brown maltiness used as this fine beers foundation. Distinct, well-placed tastes of oaky wood. True, its funky, but contented to reside on the lighter end of the funk spectrum. Drying, lightly minerally finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium, soft carbonation.

Drinkability: A very well executed sour ale, and what a top-notch, classy bottle.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
3392,"2008-02-24",4.1,"Bottled. Interesting that this is a bigger batch of Le Woody Brune, one of my favorite beers ever. While this is fairly close, it doesnt match the finesse or perfection of its parent. Perhaps though it helps that that bottle was 3 years old. Pours dark brown with little head, a touch of chunky yeast. Flavor is a dark lemony tartness, basil and surprisingly a big kick of alcohol. Licorice and pumpernickel are noticed, too. Complexity is good, though overall the aroma is a bit acrid. Flavor of biscuity malts in light sourness, a dry fresh baked bread finish. Not as much going on in the flavor. This reminds me a lot of Rodenbach original. The cherries are only lightly presented, though there is a good vinegariness in the flavor. Ive had to give this a 0.1 bump in the score as the 13oz bottle is not near enough to properly enjoy this brew. Ive got another bottle, Ill be saving it for a few years.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
3392,"2008-02-23",4.4,"EBF 08.  My favorite beer of the entire weekend by far.  I must have had 10-15 samples of this.  Pours a nice woody red with almost a violet hue, and a thin diminishing head.  Aroma is very complex- sour, fruity and woody- tons of tart cherry, cherry skin and pit- giving almost an almond like character- lots of brett bruxx giving a fruitiness- with some sour apple and cherry with some nice stinky funk, but kept in check.  Flavor is nicely sour, but not rediculously sour- everything in balance and just very complex and enjoyable- fresh tart red cherries, astringent pits, ligth sweetness cut by the acidity of the funky yeasts and bacteria- lactic sourness and some fruitiness all around.

Downrated from 4.3 to 4.0. Original: Very loooong finish on this beer, quite ptity and stony. Similar in body ( a bit thick actually) to the NG Enigma. Deeply, naturally cherry flavored, mixed with some acetic acid (a bit like the sourness of Petrus Aged Pale). A tiny bit of artificial sweeter harshness too.

Very pleasant woody / toasty oak presence in the aroma, coupled to medium-tannic red wine (pinot, zinfandel) and overly ripe bing cherries; reminds me of the relaxed sour character of something like NG Enigma; slight tartness allows a solid wood-aging and red fruit character to show through.  Relaxed carbonation.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: lightly toasted oak, tart citrus (nothing overly acidic); ripe / overripe cherries and strawberries and pitty red fruits; Id like to see a fair bit more tartness in this and slightly enhanced carbonation; time will serve this well.

3392,"2008-02-13",4.1,"From a 375mL Bottle.  A healthy crack greets the ears upon un-corking.  Pours a mostly transparent, ruddy amber color with a thick finger of tight bubbled, beige head.  A cobwebby brett blanket entangles the filling from Thanksgivings cherry pie.  Subdued, yet distinct, the cherry character maintains a softness that settles in cohesively with the barrel funk and light oak spice.  A small glimpse of ripened apple skins sharpens the bouquet up with just a dash of acetic bite.  Medium light bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel with a moderate level of tangy acidity.  Flavors of ripened cherry skins, frosty with wild yeast, accompanied by a gentle cidery acidity.  A joyful balance between fruit and acid.  Notes of peppery oak and musty horseblanket.  Toward the finish, the brett and oak work together to scrub the palate clean, leaving behind a subtle tannic dryness.  The flavors are satisfying, but the body seems to fall flat a bit quickly, losing the brightness of the initial acidity a bit quickly, not sticking around long enough to enjoy the flavors left in the finish.  All the flavor/aroma dimensions of the beer are displayed in an impressive fashion, but the body doesnt stand up to the other achievements, preventing this from achieving ""masterpiece"" status.  Regardless, an overall marvelous beer.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

3392,"2008-02-10",4.0,"Pours a very attractive cloudy rusty red-brown with a small but infinitely long lasting off-white head.  Aroma is an earthy sort of tart when the beers colder; reminiscent of mustard, hay, vinegar, grass clippings and such.  As it warms, the mustard subsides and a subtle, incredibly unsweetened fruit takes its place, then becoming a bit more distinctly ""cherry"".  Some oak barrel in there as well, very well rounded aroma overall.  Very brief cherry flavor gives way to an old dry mustard earthiness, vinegar, oak, unsweet cherry; its certainly tart enough for me.  Finishes with a bit more fruit coming out (still subtle) and then a lot of bitter oak and an almost tingling dry sensation on the back.  My mouth feels a bit ""cloyed"" but I tend to feel that way with sour beers.  Almost light bodied texture, medium to high carbonation, but the beer feels nice and full, whereas I find that sours tend to feel ""empty"" bodied sometimes.

3392,"2007-12-05",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 21, 2009 RERATE (3.9) from 2008 bottle and shared with Shawn: Not nearly as impressive as the first pre-release bottle I had at the PP SAF but still it was a very nice Sour Ale with twangy fruit and acidic tones, moderate funk and mineral components. A bit plastic and medicinal as it warmed. I still would enjoy this anytime. I am splitting the difference with the scores to produce a 4.1 active rating.  ORIGINAL RATING (4.3) 2007 PP SAF Bottles provided by the man Tomme Arthur: Mahogany hue with small head and sticky lace. The aroma has notes of funk, wood, sour cherry and grape, grassy and a touch catty. The taste has a big fruity acidic front with light funk and wood. I also get some wheat, grass, and tannic finish. The mouth feel is smooth yet twangy, sprite and refreshing. Already near a masterpiece and I would love to try this when released full time. Big taste is a sessionable beer!","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

3392,"2007-12-01",4.3,"The funkiest beer yet from the FunkMeister himself. Light white wine barrel action goes refreshingly well with garlic and artichoke pizza. Grapes and apples along with sweet Belgian yeast (yes, I said sweet yeast).","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"

Re-sampled in bottle on 2/9/08 - thanks a ton for crackin this J.  This was the first sample in DM #3 with myself and Hapjydeuce.  A perfect start.  This put forth a soft and soothing palate - a touch of conditioning did this wonders.  Tart, but not jackhammer sour - which I more thoroughly enjoy.  Tart cherries meet head on with an arrogance of oaky goodness and a smirk of stubborn bret.  Excellent brew!  Truly some artwork...","San Francisco, California, USA","jarspag"
