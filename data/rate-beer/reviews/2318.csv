Alcohol is there, but well hidden considering the ABV. Overall, I was looking for something richer and fruitier.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

Pours a very dark chocolate brown color with very slight mahogany edges when held to a light source and a two finger frothy beige head that has excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that coats the goblet with rings and streaks of soapy lacing.

Roasted malt aroma with hints of sweet dark chocolate, peppery spice, licorice, citrus peel and dark fruit notes. Im picking up a bit of dark cherry as well as some plum, raisin and fig.

On the heavier end of medium bodied with some tingling tight carbonation up front. Lots of peppery, zesty spice notes ip front as well which are countered by a dark roasted chocolate maltiness mid-palate. Im also picking up slight burnt toast as well as hints of cinnamon, pepper, licorice and citrus peel. Again, the dark fruit notes make an appearance, most notably cherry, raisin, fig and plum before finishing off slightly bitter and dry.

The flavor is surprisingly well balanced for such a big beer, not overly sweet of boozy at all.   Chocolate and fruit again make an appearance, with a drying finish that is actually pretty light.   Alcohol sticks out a little in the finish as well, and just keeps this from being really drinkable (not that you necessarily want that in a beer like this).   Good stuff for the most part, a darker, chocolatey take on the style, though not something that I would get again given the price.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

22 oz bottle poured into my Chimay Chalice.

A- Body is a very dark brown, hazy, translucent cola color. Pours with an immense 3 finger+ billowing foamy dream colored head. head eventually fades to 1/2 finger and has good retention from there.

S- A complex balance of spicy Belgian yeast, anise, and an essence of rootbeer, with some deep malt added in. The spicy yeast is probably the main character here; but just barely.

T-Upfront spicy Belgian yeast is definitely the main character. This is is balanced with a backbone of black licorice, plums, and a hint of sweetness. The spicy Belgian yeast comes through even more for the finish- a mild dose of booziness also adds to the finish. What is left to linger is a balance of spiciness, an essence of root beer, and a mild alcohol heat-especially as it warms.

P-Moderate carbonation and a thick, heavy yeasty body. Phenolic consistency can be mildly detected within the body.

O- This is a very good BSDA. Quite tasty and one I would love to have again. I love the spicy yeast character of it. One of the great American examples of a quality Belgian ale. ABV is detectable-but drinks more like an 8.5% vs 11.5% so it can still be deceiving. Wonderful job overall by midnight sun.

Interesting nose to be sure, but a bit muddled. Taste is light soured black ckerry skin, followed by a smoky roasty malt, finishing with a spiced, almost banana yeastiness.

6/18/2009:  The color of Midnight Sun Monks Mistress Belgian-Style Special Dark Ale is a dark caramelized amber-brown and has an opaque appearance.  There is a dark beige-colored head that is foamy like a mocha would have.  The aroma contains caramelized malt, is delicately roasty like toasted coffee beans, and has a hint of dry smoke.

A slight cocoa is evident as well as intense maltiness.  Some cola as well.  Complex is the word.  Pannepot also comes to mind.  Flavor is intense plum and chocolate, DRY thank god, with a nice floral and fruity finish.  Thankfully this is fully attenuated as Ive had lots of American examples that are too sweet.

Flavor has a mild roasted character with just the right amount of candi sugar to compliment but not overwhelm the pastry and bread malt, a sparkling of those earthy hops, great smoky, semi-sweet chocolate, especially at the finish. The palate was the weakest aspect of the beer as it was just an ever-so-slight touch soda-like, but I only complain because the rest of it was so good so I wanted it to approach perfection.

How: Bottle 660ml.  Sent to me by JCB, thanks a lot Jason.
The look: Dark burgundy topped by a medium beige head
In long: A strong malty nose with roasted wood, roasted almonds and coal.  I like my dubbles very nutty and this one delivers on the nutty side.  Chestnuts mainly but also peanuts, almonds, and more All those nutty flavours wrapped in a rich dark caramel, some molasses and notes of brown sugar.  Fruity notes of dark fruits concentrate remain subtle in the back.  Hops that taste like peppery tobacco leaves.  Round and full body with an extra-lively carbonation.  Maybe its the exaggeratedly lively carbonation that was too much but I found the whole to be less than the sum of its parts.  reading myself its like Im describing the perfect Dubble when in reality it was just a very good beer.

Thanks to someone for sending me this in a trade quite a while ago.  I wish I would have tried it sooner; the time in the cellar does not seem to have done it much good.  Its still decent but based on other peoples ratings my expectations were just a little higher than the actual experience.

Aroma / Appearance - A two finger clingy head bobbed above a deep black and fluid body.  Walnuts, blackberries, slightly off milk, and other malty characteristics make this one acceptable.  Its not quite what I thought as if something was just mildly off kilter.

Flavor / Palate - The viscous mouthfeel was odd.  Black olives, rich dark chocolate, and almonds are not a combination you taste every day.  Uneven as it transitions to a malty finish this has some weaknesses.  Despite being good overall I dont think I will be avidly seeking this out again.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Aroma has a huge roasted malt base with some Belgian yeast thrown in.  Dark fruit are also evident with raisins and grapes clearly present as well as a spicy character throughout.  Maybe even a hint of tart in the nose as well, but only a hint.

Taste has an overall cola flavor with the roasted malts forming the backbone.  The dark fruit sweetness pop up front, but the spiciness takes over in the finish and shows itself much more than in the aroma.  Belgian yeasts and candied sugars round out this very complex taste.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with huge carbonation that fizzes all over the palate.

First taste had some roasty barley and creamy notes, making me think of a strong porter or stout, but then the Belgian yeast and candied sugar made its presence known, hitting with some notes of malt, cotton-candy, burnt sugar, and stewed fruits.

2318,"2008-02-10",4.1,"This beauty pours a very dark, inky looking mahogany that is very nearly black in color.  A large, foamy tan head settles rather quickly to a thin layer with a disproportionately large edge.  Each swirl of the viscous liquid yields sudsy lacing that slowly oozes its way back to the body.  The aroma shows a bevy of dark fruits, particularly plums and dates.  There is a good dose of scorched caramel and bakers chocolate, as well as a large serving of darkly toasted grains. Sweet molasses and stewed raisons round out the deep, inviting nose.  The flavor is a seamless continuation of the theme, further proving that this one defies the traditional definition of a dubbel.  The rich, malty chocolate and caramel are again accompanied by various dark fruits, this time with some dry woodsy notes and a light floral hoppiness as well. Finishes somewhat spicy, adding yet another layer of depth.  Easily the best dubbel Ive encountered to date.  Excellent.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Dark fruit aromas dominate from the start, and theres quite a lot of raisin and fig in the initial taste.

2318,"2008-01-12",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2008 Bottled August 2007; Sampled January 2008
Quite well carbonated, a very careful pour produces a fat, five finger thick, light brown colored head that grows above the top of my tulip glass.  The beer is quite dark, with an opaque, deeply burnt brown color that shows some clear, ruby hued highlights around the edges when held up to the lightly.  Earthy, concentrated notes of dark fruit is the most evident part of the aroma; aromas of roasted, slightly burnt raisins is definitely noticeable.  Quite spicy as well with notes of white pepper, substantial clove, some allspice, touches of mace and a woody, slightly savory note similar to a cross between sarsaparilla, birch and a touch of cinnamon bark.  Quite aromatic, one of those beers whose aroma jumps out of the glass.  This seems like quite a decadent tipple based on the aroma.  Even 5 minutes later I still have four fingers of head on this brew, that is why I love tulip glasses as I can still easily get a sip of the brew under all this foam.  This does leave quite a few patches of sticky foam on the sides of my glass as I slowly work my way through the beer.

Sweet tasting and quite redolent of dark fruit; raisin puree, prunes, dried figs and perhaps a touch of dried cherry and dried cranberry.  The beer finishes with a cola like spiciness as well as a dusty, browned malt note, notes of cocoa powder and a touch of hop bitterness.  While fairly sweet the beer is actually some what light feeling, at least it is light feeling for a beer of this strength and sweetness as this is most definitely a sipping brew.  It is thick enough that the slightly excessive carbonation is barely noticed.  The carbonation does add a peppery, carbonic bit to this brew though.  There is quite a bit of dark malt character here; from toasty grain notes, to touches of chocolate, a dusting of roast coffee, lots of brown sugar notes and darkly caramelized, sweet malt.  The beer has a touch of tartness to it in the finish that seems a product of both the dark grain and some yeast by products.

As the beer warms up a bit and loses more of the carbonation, it actually seems to get a bit lighter on the palate, becomes a bit less sweet with more of a balance to the chocolate/cocoa dark malt notes.  A hint of tamarind becomes noticeable as it couples with the soft tartness in the finish.  This has a lot more dark malt character than one would typically get in a beer from Belgium, but I like that added dimension in this brew (after all this isnt Belgian).  The dark malt helps to balance the huge, dark fruit character.  This is quite a good beer; it can be a bit sweet at first and perhaps a bit on the thin side after a while, but it is definitely enjoyable.

Initial flavor of ashen coffee grounds and cola bitterness; very dark with powerful black licorice and caramelized onion sweetness, which provides an awesome, unique temperament to complement the more normal tones of banana esters, peppermint, and pear.  Dry, woodsy bitterness frames a kind of elusive maple and nutty sweetness; hazelnut, bark, hints of raspberry and even strawberry.

Dense en bouche, impressionnante épaisseur, caractère malté à en boire et à en mastiquer, chocolat amère, discrète fumée, et sucre initial se métamorphosant graduellement vers lacidité.  Un mordant dalcool devient de plus en plus apparent et nous réchauffe sûrement.  Texture crémeuse et soyeuse, carbonatation piquante et vigoureuse, longue finale exposant de douces levures typiquement belges.  Une bonne raison dêtre moine!","Quebec, CANADA","OlivierMTL"

2318,"2005-06-25",4.4,"06.25.05  22oz bottle thanks to footbalm.   Label claims bottled in second week of July, but no year mentioned (probably 2004).  Truly dirty dark brown pour with a naughty khaki head that insists on making me wait to smell and taste the brew.  Damn is it ever worth it!  Rich is the word of the day with deep prune, rum, vanilla, nougat, and cocoa aromas.  On top of that, and behind it, I smell burnt bananas, bourbon soaked cherries, cookie dough, and 5:AM in a bakery.  Damn, I didnt expect it to be this good.  Flavor is full of veggies and old fruit.  But the one flavor/aroma I cant shake is some kind of candy Ive had--Im not sure what it is, maybe Charleston chew, maybe Three Musketeers, maybe Almond Joy (theres certianly a hint of coconut if I think about it).  Whatever, its outstanding.  I can only imagine Chimay aspiring to be a sweet, balanced, tasty, and smooth as this Alaskan concoction.  Kudos!  I had no idea what to expect with this brew and had not indulged in reading any of the reviews before sampling, but Im not too surprised to see that the main cirticism was sweetness while I tend to love sweeter beers when they have good balance.  My only complaint is that theres more carbonation than it needs, but smaller sips and higher temps seem to elude that problem.  Thanks a million to Eric for this surprise nectar!","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

2318,"2005-02-02",3.9,"July 02 dating, snifter.  Mountainous light brown head that puts nitro cans to shame in form and persistence.  A deep blood red to purple hue is visually enticing.  More simply could not have been asked for in this respect.  Sharp caramel, dark chocolate, and a hint of walnuts are the brunt of the malt aroma.  Hops are light, but distinctly of a floral and herb aroma.  Yeast comes across quite leathery.  Other aromas include red grapes, plums, prunes, cassis, port and a touch of alcohol.  The yeast profile keeps me from scoring this higher.  Flavor does not deviate from the aroma in any significant manner.  As expected, the beer starts off heavily sweet and then backs off a bit as a tinge of acidity and bitterness jump in.  A bit of vodka-like alcohol sharpness is an unwelcome presence.  Body is thinner than expected, albeit still moderately heavy, but in hindsight it seems that candi sugar might have been used quite liberally in this beer.  Carbonation is average.  Overall, a bit watery.  The bottom line is: Looks good/smells good/tastes good/feels goodbut, the yeast and the alcohol really hurt this beer.

 Rating # 570
Bottle dated 1st week of September 2003
 This beer was carbonated like none other! I popped the cap and FSSSSSSIT, a loud gust of carbonation. Pours a shadowy dark amber body.. almost brown in color. The head is a massive and rocky kaki foam. The lacing is ridiculous it cloaks the inner glass with the finniest film and lacey bubbles. 
This beer is nothing like I was expecting! Actually, I dont know what I was expecting but I dont think it was this? The aroma is sweet with chocolate, toffee, and molasses and lightly smoky Fruity notes of figs, dates, and chocolate covered orange sections. Man, you dont have many Belgian Strong Ales with such a character of a porter style beer. Im finding large notes of coffee in the flavor but with that yeasty, spicy and doughy flavor that typifies the BSAs. There are such immense suggestions of chocolate and vanilla in the brew its incredible! There are also big suggestions of raisins, black pepper and tangerine zests. Honestly, I think this could be a Belgian style Imperial Stout! 
The palate is very sticky but velvety. I dont know what was done differently to this beer but the carbonation is as awesome sensation! The finish is filled a smoky molasses. Yeah, this is a superb brew!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

Creamy, frothy, super-dense carbonation clinging to the glass to form a parabolic shape in my glass.  An aroma from a foot away, rich sweet caramel, roasted cocoa, grape, fruits and malts in weird combinations.  The palate was a mouth explosion, though with a few thin spots as it warmed, a half-life decay.  The alcohol drives too much of the flavor, though it remains fruity and malty in abundance.

The flavor is strong apple/grape peel, minus the sour, mixed with very earthy yeasts and a hint of bitter like hard water but very balanced and an almost inpercievable sweetness. The carbonationis excellent. There are hints of cinnamon roll and the palate could not be smoother. A water clean finish that leaves the mouth tingling.

Very perfumey and fruity aroma with banana, raisin, toffee, spices, and perhaps raspberry.  The flavor began with a potent yeasty, intensely bready aspect that led to a tart, strong prune and raisin fruitiness with caramel, cherry, and a touch of chocolate before finishing with ethanol (which enhanced the complexity nicely) and a dash of cinnamon as well as candi sugar.

2318,"2004-04-09",4.4,"Much darker than I expected, deep purple with reddish highlights that produces a big frothy off-white head and excellent lacing. The aroma hints of barnyard and earthy yeast esters, figs, blueberry, banana, smoked malts, candi sugars, sweet spices (who knows what, I smell them but can't place them) and moderate phenols. The taste starts sweet and yeasty, get a lot of caramel tones, ripen fruits and yeasty overtones. Depth is provided by the spices (pepper and caramom?), mild bitter hops, and some earthy tones. The finish is not as overpowering as some Belgium strongs, smoother yet still packs quite a punch. A woody dryness with a fruity semi-sweet tone. The mouthfeel is lively yet rich, only slightly warming, way too easy to drink! This is a top-notch beer, nearly every bit as good as the traditional Strongs. A must try for any ratebeerian!

2318,"2004-03-22",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2006 9% Abv bottle from the second week of January 2003.  Pours a mocha brown with some darker browns, light hints of red and orange and everything between.  Good beige head that sticks around and is quite fizzy.  Aroma is of dry raisins, figs, and slight hints of coffee beans.  Light, but good with a hint of hops as well.  Flavor begins quite carbonated, yet I dont see any sediment and it looks quite clear.  Flavor has woodiness in it, hints of dark fruit and tons of dry raisin flavor, with a solid offering of belgian yeast.  The flavor is good enough to style and reminds me of Rocheforte 10, but as I keep drinking, the flavor remains too dry, too filtered tasting and ultimately, never develops enough complexity/depth of malt.  Finish is odd as well, too much bitter hops apparency detracts from the style, and it has a bit of an acidic bite to it.  Lots of astringency, and just kind of lifeless feeling, like theyve filtered all of the good stuff out. Medium body, with some thinning as it warms. Quite disappointed, perhaps the 8.2 version was much better, I think I have a bottle of that aging, and along with my 3 bottles of the 9 abv aging, Im really hoping this stuff improves.  Rerate.  Tried another bottle, hoping for an improvement and there was.  I actually saw traces of sediment, the flavor was less dry, some esters and malt.  This bottle had some life in it, but Im still not sold.  Would like to see a lot less filtration, and a LOT MORE malt/yeast complexity.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Complex is the word that comes to mind. More malts and hops than in the nose. The raisin and grape start to fade moreso into a wine like flavor. Alcohol is strong, but is balanced by the other flavors. Spices show up as well. Coriander makes itself known. A bit of caramel is present. There is the doughiness around too.

2318,"2004-02-16",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2004 Very dark brown hue with a light brown head that quickly turns into a ring. Aroma is rather overwhelmed by alcohol and you seriously have to pass over that flavour to be able to appreciate the rest which consists in bready dark malts (smoke, cigar) and good malt strenght (dark chocolate, plums). In mouth, it's a little more interesting, but still very strong alcohol wise for a 9% beer this highly rated. Mostly on the sweet side with touches of several dark fruits (bays, prunes, blackberries, cherries), quite yeasty also. Not much hops or bitterness to balance the alcohol sweetness which keeps going a long time in the aftertaste, but obvious notes of fireplace and ashes keep it from being too much. Body is very creamy and quite carbonated. What's up with this beer? Everyone seems to love it and every 4 of my tasting buddies were severly disappointed. Bad bottle? It didn't seem like it. Perhaps it's too young, so I'd suggest laying this down a bit before tasting it because it sure as hell is usually my type of beer.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Full body, syrupy/velvety texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

The aroma of ripe cherries, maybe even pineapple, nice sweet malt under pinning, fresh, clean and very inviting, a portent of things to come, start is rich in malt, ambrosial with a middling to full top. Stingingly acidic is the finish with the hops mighty in their spiciness, vinous aftertaste and a bit of tummy warming from the 8.20 percent ABV, another fine brew from a most excellent brewery.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
2318,"2003-11-13",4.4,"Among the best Abbey Dubbel/Belgian Strongs you'll find - absolutley indistinguishable from belgians. Equal to Allagash's Dubbel reserve. Thinnish, but crisp and a bit smoky, with great mixtures of caramel malt and a crisp hop close, this is close to Westy 8 territory. Delicious. A sipper for a whole evening. Delight in the yeast development from tart and citric to full and bready as the beer warms. Pepper + breadiness as raindog says, and as joet says this could kick total ass with cheeses. Yummmmmmm....this brewery is doing things right.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
2318,"2003-11-13",4.3,"Pours a dark mohagany brown with a thick pillowy dark tan head.  Sweet dark bready Belgian malt aroma with some hints of sourness and dark fruits.  Body has all the flavor and complexity of it's Belgian counterparts.  Rich, sweet and robust, with plenty of caramel, toffee, and dark fruit, especially red grape flavor.  Sweet bready viscous oily body is everything a Belgian strong should be.  I have loved everything I've tried from this brewery!","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
2318,"2003-11-10",4.1,"Deep brown, pours with a big head.  Peppery, sweet, slightly bready aroma.  Flavor is somewhat brown sugar sweet and slight alcoholic.  Balanced.  Sweet finish.  Good and Strong","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
2318,"2003-11-05",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2005 Re-rate:Yep,this is a favorite of mine. Earthy,sweet,yeasty....delicious!!! Deep,dark,brown.Red hues. Huge,khaki,head. The slowest pour doesnt help.Dense and very creamy. Extremely aromatic. Fresh yeast(peppery),dark fruit,bready/sweet malts,in the aroma. The sofest carbonation,and very creamy mouthfeel. Full body. Great bisciut,fruity,malts in the flavors.Slightly yeasty,and medicinal.  Finish is bready,fruity with lingering pepper(yeast). Alcohol is pleasent and warming. Was buzzing half way through the bottle. The alcohol sticks out a bit much in the aroma,and thats about the only complaint.In a blind tasting there would be no doubt this was made in Belgium. Excellent Us made Belgian!!","Evansville, Indiana, USA","raindog"
2318,"2003-10-29",4.4,"GABF 2003:Oh man... this one is demanding multiple tastings. Excellent complexities, all of tangy, sour fruit -- apples and peaches, alcoholic, pretty in appearance, alcoholic, soft and subtle, perfect for picnics with mild cheeses, breads and light non-citrus fruits. wow! this is very impressive. One of the top 5 beers I've tasted at GABF 2003.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
2318,"2003-10-13",4.7,"Pours with a thick, 5-finger plus, light brown head that gradually fades slowly, leaves hardly any lace.  Takes 15 minutes just to pour.   Dark, brown color.  Nose is very sweet and malty.  Heavy bodied but light carbonation.  Starts sweet, finishes smooth and sweet with just a trace of hops.  An excellent Belgian style ale.  $8.99 for a 22oz bottle.  The ABV is 9.0% now.","Bow, New Hampshire, USA","jimhilt"
2318,"2003-09-30",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 22, 2004 Deep brown with a dark ruby-redness and a sudsy, off-white head. Estery aromas of yeast. Effervescent carbonation; smooth and creamy body. Slightly burnt and a little spicy. Malty (caramel, roasted nuts, bitter chocolate) with a sugary (Belgian candi) base. Had elements of cooked molasses. Warming alcohol. Moderately bitter hops (grassy). Really nice flavors of caramel and toffee linger well into the aftertaste. Tasty and interesting.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
2318,"2003-09-16",4.5,"Very dark brown color with a lingering, off-white, creamy thick head. Aroma of dark fruits and malts. Full body with high carbonation and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is very rich with plums and caramel notes. Also, a very rich and full maltiness is present. Hops are secondary to the big malt and dark fruit flavors. Has some yeastiness. Very creamy and delicious, the head retention is magnificent. Wow, avery nice strong ale with both Belgian and American influences.","Greenville, South Carolina, USA","Uglyradio"
2318,"2003-08-23",4.1,"Oh boy, here we go.  Deep ruby, garnet, brown hue.  Big pale tan head.  Giant effervesence.  Fruity, yeast, roasted?, spice nose.  Estery, sweet, caramelized sugar, faint smoke/toasted flavor.  Light-footed palate feel, yet definately assaulting the taste buds.  Yeasty, sweet, molasses, finishing dark and dry, with a lingering flavor hard for me to describe...This stuff is expensive in MASSACHUSETTS!","Amherst, Massachusetts, USA","Hopistotle420"
2318,"2003-08-11",4.3,"Bottled version, seemingly bottled in July 2003:Very dark ruby brown, with a tan, ""whole wheat"" looking head; Prune and fig aroma, with some over-ripe nectarine and a touch of wet cardboard. Spicy and slightly(ever so) roasty in the mouth, with a deep, creamy body and noticeable alchohol. Slight alcohol burn as it goes down, but also some bitter spicey elements, orange peel, cinnamon and cherry esther amongst them. Pretty impressive stuff, let's see how this ages.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Perkeo"
2318,"2003-03-02",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 24, 2004 On tap at the 2004 Great Alaska Beer and Barley Wine Festival.  Murky brown with a foamy tan head.  Spicey candi sugar nose.  Molasses, dark brown sugar, raisin and wood flavors.  Well balanced and easy to drink.  It makes you grin when you drink it.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
