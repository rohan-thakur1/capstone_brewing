722,"2017-04-27",3.4,"Bottle from brewery. Caramel aroma. Spicy taste, herbal hoppiness. Dry finish with caramel notes.","Waterloo, Ontario, CANADA","kevinsenn"
722,"2016-06-29",3.6,"Torn on this. The flavor is quite good, some caramel mixed with hops, but the alcohol is very very noticeable. Too much so to be truly enjoyable.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
722,"2015-02-26",4.1,"This was a joint tasting with Strykzone via Facebook Chat. This was purchased at Pauls Market in McCall, Idaho. It seemed to have been on the shelf for a year so was well aged. It poured a dark amber color with big creamy long lasting off-white head that left thick lacing in my Stone Old Guardian goblet. Nose is is rich caramel malts with floral hops. Medium plus in body with a smooth creamy mouth feel. Some alcohol detected but not objectionable. The flavor is like a barley wine that seems mixed with a DIPA. There is lot rye but it blends perfectly with the malts and hops. Lot of complexity here with fruit, and some bitterness. The finish shows every thing and this just is a shame to come to an end. It is just so drinkable. Overall this is a a very well crafted beer. I give Moab high marks for this one.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
722,"2015-02-26",4.1,"Bomber from Hayduke that we had together via facebook chat. The beer is amber in hue and cloudy. A big beige foam that leaves thick and cool looking lacing. A really nice aroma of caramel, fruit, and rye. The flavor has rye, floral and fruit plus caramel. So much richness here. Rich fruit that doesnt really fit into a citrus description. Some tropical fruit that includes pineapple. Ron informs me he let this set on the shelf for at least a year. It does have barley wine flavor with a little oxidation. But it might have found a sweet spot. Everything worked so well together. Perhaps the rye brought everything out. This was a delight to drink!","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
722,"2014-06-17",3.9,"Its an American strong red ale made with rye, but really it sits somewhere in the common set of Barley Wine and Double IPA. Aroma is apple crumble and maraschino cherry, touches of alcohol but without any hot ethanol notes. Gingerbread, seeds, hay, pepper and caramelized sugar. Rich and full body with fine natural carbonation. Sugar is braced by hop acidity / bitterness, while carbonation gives a proper burst of life. Sugar is in that sweet spot, providing ample juiciness without any fatiguing unfermentables... it does quickly dry out in the finish and finally shows its forceful hop bitterness. From bottle, with orange-ruby tones and a fine and lasting head.   Theres a lot more depth here than you typically find in Barley Wine-strength hoppy red ale.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
722,"2014-06-06",3.7,"Pours reddish/amber with small head. Rye grain adds some nuttiness to the flavor and overall presentation. No grain sourness detected, overall very smooth.","Boise, Idaho, USA","stevoj"

Ladies and gents, we have a winner! This is my first experience with Moab and they certainly knocked this one out of the park...enticing, clean, and balanced, you really couldnt ask for much more out of this style (an ASA heading towards Barleywine, or Imperial Red for trendy folks...Ive never liked our Specialty Grain ""style"" since since its not a style; it tells you absolutely nothing about the beer character). The aroma is an enticing explosion of rich sweet malts and tropical fruit galore, with no trace at all of icky resinous/raw hops. Think Green Flash Barleywine or Eel River Triple Exultation or Humboldt 500 BC. Its almost perfectly balanced in the mouth (for this kind of beer) and thus extraordinarily drinkable...the alcohol burn is a touch strong, but honestly that is my *only* gripe with this (otherwise it might be a 5 for the mouthfeel). It starts lusciously sweet, but finishes with bone-dry bitterness (without astringency or strong acidity, this is ginsu-blade bitterness here). And most surprising of all...so clean! No husks or off notes whatsoever to my nose...really well-made. And despite the alcohol burn, it is insanely quaffable due to the extraordinary flavor balance. This is one of those occasions where I could hardly write a review before drinking two full glasses. Major kudos to this brewer for making me like something in a style that I usually hate.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

722,"2014-03-31",4.2,"Very very nice. I always have a hard time describing rye ales, but this is a good one. With the hops, you get a nice extra twist, with surprisingly not overwhelming bitterness. I like it.","Gilbert, Arizona, USA","mikedR"
722,"2014-02-25",3.9,"Poured a muddy looking brownish color with a medium-sized off-white head. Nice aroma with lots of rye, molasses, spruce, and resin. Taste is full flavored with lots of good hoppy notes. Good malty backbone with a slightly nutty flavor. Honey and rye blend well with pine and caramel. Overall very nice!","Maryland, USA","scottw86"

Pours a medium, well retained ivory head, withh some lacing, over a slightly hazy dark amber (SRM 15) body....nose is rye, light dried fruits including fig, light pine, hints of citrus....taste is rye, lightly sweet with toffee/caramel tones, hints of floral honey, finishing with a lingering pine,resin, citrus peel bitterness....mouth feel medium, soft, light alcohol warmth, carbonation low. with a mildly acid finish.

722,"2013-08-08",3.8,"Poured from a large, tall bottle into a pint glass to drink. The beer had a cloudy deep, hazy amber color with a big foamy and creamy deep off-white head that had great retention, and very good cling and lacing. Its aroma featured a blend of rye, pine, floral and citrus hops, along with some grainy and earthy hops and lighter bits of caramel malt and spice. Its taste was a mix of bitter hops and rye, with a significant amount of spice, and a bit of sour characteristic. It had a somewhat wet and watery body, but a very full and thick mouthfeel with ample carbonation and life, and a dry finish. Thank you Scott & Tab for the great birthday present!","Denver, Colorado, USA","Derek881"
722,"2013-07-14",3.8,"Bottle from Whole Foods P Street. Clear amber color, medium white head. Aroma of citrus, light pine, subtle toast. Taste is malty and fruity with a bit of spice. Decent.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
722,"2013-06-29",3.4,"Pineapple and toffee entice the nose of the drinker. Although caramel and toffee dominate, there is a nice hop balance finishing surprisingly dry with spicy rye notes.","Georgia, USA","TheBeerWenchGA"
722,"2013-06-24",4.0,"50cl swing top bottle (8.59% ABV) pours with a dark clear amber body that supports a tan head of foam. The modest aroma offers up sweet malts and then faint levels of musty brown sugar covered prunes and then some vague resiny hop notes. The taste is smooth sweet and then more and more resiny bitter hops. The more I drink I think the more I like. It has smooth sweet soft malts, a dash of prunes, raisins and booze and toward the finish a resiny hoppiness grows and grows and dominates at the end. This is pretty darn nice.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
722,"2013-06-24",3.2,"Bottle at a tasting.

Aroma: Eh average malt aroma. Couldnt tell it was rye. Piney, citrus-y hops though!

Appearance: Dark amber body. Large frothy off-white head, excellent lacing.

Taste: Ok, the rye is more present in the flavor. Its quite present, actually. Almost overpowers the hops, which are there, but kind of get lost.

Palate: Light/medium body. Medium finish.

Overall: Definitely a rye beer, but its no Wookey Jack.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","wildbeercat"
