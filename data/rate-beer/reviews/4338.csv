Poured into a handled bar stein it gives a dark amber body with a fairly slim almost white top. Fairly light on scent I do smell grain and sourdough.

4338,"2016-04-24",3.2,"12 oz. bottled poured into a pint glass. Originally reviewed 6/1/2011.
Small off-white head tops a dark amber body. Clear and very dark. Not much lacing on this at all.
 I dont get much hops. I get some pine aroma, but its second to the malt, which is quite toasty.
Follows the smell. Not much hops up front. Goes right into a burnt toast malt flavor. Very bready. Its accentuated by a strong bitter aftertaste.

Heavier mouthfeel than I was expecting. Strong bitter finish makes it feel heavier than it really is as well. Its not really smooth or easy drinking at all.

Interesting take on an ESB. The flavors are overwhelming in a negative sort of way. Too bitter of a finish and the malts are too burnt tasting. I get that its a double ESB, I just dont love how it comes together.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

Pours a hazy caramel with a soid foamy head that recedes to a swirl along the top.

Heavy caramel malt sweetness with some toast and lit earthy hop bitterness.  There is a bit of pine resin and medicinal character as it warms.

The taste has lots bitter hops up front, especially for an ESB.  The caramel malts dominate the backbone with a more prominent biscuit flavor than in the aroma.

The mouthfeel is pretty full bodied for an ESB, prickly from the hops and with strong carbonation.

This is an amped up ESB to be sure and I wouldnt call it terribly drinkable for the style but it more complex than most, so I would certainly recommend it.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
4338,"2011-04-18",4.2,"Aroma is sweet resin-hop with alcohol definitely present. Also contains strong fruity notes that resemble fruity pebbles cereal..... or fruit roll-ups, if you will (Do they still make those?) A beautiful reddish-amber color with a clear complexion. Develops an impressive white frothy head that quickly diminishes after the pour. Very minimal lacing occurs (more like spotting... again, if you will). Heavy bitter taste (much like an IPA) with a fruit notes gathering in the nose. Medium-bodied that is impressive as far as ales go, with a slick texture. Fizzy carbonation in the mouth with a lingering bitter finish that is a bit biting. Not a bad brew, although Im not jumping off the couch to buy more.","Oklahoma, USA","HopsIPAndDrunk"

4338,"2011-04-02",3.2,"A: The pour is a dark copper color with a soapy off-white head and minimal lacing.

S: This one pretty much just smells like toast and toasted malts.  I was expecting a bit more hop character at least, but apparently Im not going to get it.  Maybe a touch of earthy and floral hops if you really strain yourself.

T: Like the nose, this beer is all about the toast/toasted malt.  Mildly sweet but a fair amount of bitterness is present as well.  Not a ton of hop flavor, either.  Like with the nose there are just hints of floral and earthy hops.

M: Nice and medium-full in body with a moderate level of carbonation.

Pours a medium brown colored body, clearish with a big creamy off-white head. Hoppy grapefruity aroma, very bitter and dry smelling. Creamy, hoppy bitter dry taste. Some strawberry maltiness too. Letting it warm up a bit for some more flavor...Some more flavor. Not too bad. Much more flavor. No aftertaste, it just fades.","Houston, Texas, USA","jujubeast6000"

4338,"2008-06-14",3.7,"(On tap at Draught House on June 14, 2008)  I seem to be drinking all the new beers today.  English strong ale, huh?  Lets see... bartender said its a bit too malty.  Ill try to ignore that comment so my tongue isnt tainted.  Color is murky brown with a tint of orange.  Yep... looks malty.  Its look/color reminds me of wort.  Fine off-white head (alot like a Guiness head).  Nose is lightly sweet and floral.  One question... why is a winter seasonal first poking its head out in the summer?  Taste is malty, but not so bad... pretty dense and heavy, but has a light flavor.  Has a bit of a pick-me-up for a heavier winter brew.  Palate is dense, but theres a bit of its lightness that seeps toward my cheeks.  Very interesting.  Neat recipe, Real Ale... no aftertaste, so I find myself drinking a bit faster.  My friend says its hoppy but I just drank an IPA, so its hard to tell at this point.  I like it... its got some heft.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"
4338,"2008-03-21",3.5,"The beer is classified as an English Strong Ale, it weighs in at 6.6% ABV with 50 IBU. This is Real Ales winter seasonal which smacks of English style but with a distinctively Texas taste.
The Beer has a very light nose. It might because I have a slight cold or it might be that the beer keeps all of its flavor for your palate but got very little nose off of my initial investigation. I believe that just as you eat with your eyes you also drink with your eyes. So the question becomes does this beer say pick me up and drink me?  This is a great looking beer. It has a white creamy head that has great lacing that hangs all the way down the glass. The body is fairly clear with an amber black color. 
Real Ale claims that this this ale is about hops. The blend of English hops, highlighted by its namesake, Phoenix, yields a complex hop character that dominates this special brew. I hope that my recent IPA bingeing hasnt left my palate overly shocked, because I didnt really get hoppy bitterness off the beer. But I did get some light hoppy floral notes, which could mean that the brewers were going with a sweeter less bitter hoppy approach which is a much welcomed change from the rest of the ESBs Ive had of late. What I did get was a rich yet balanced malty flavor. This taste comes from the English crystal malt which brings with it a light toffee and caramel undertone. The ale has a very short lived finish, which is great because as much as I like IPAs and ESBs I dont like to taste them in the morning. This beer has a medium body with a very light and watery mouth feel.
Overall I would call this a very well balanced flavorful beer and is a great way to start off the night.","Sugarland, Texas, USA","texasbartender"

Mouth has a thickish feel with good flavoring on the finish.  A very smooth, easy drinking beer-could be a mini-session beer if they bottled it.

Aroma is pretty strong and biting, with a lot of citrus hops and burnt roasty malt.  Taste has a similar ""American strong"" quality about it, with a lot of caramel and toast malt tastes and bitter, almost stinging hop flavor.  Towards swallowing I taste a lot of pears, which makes it obvious that this is the same brewer that does Sisyphus.  Finish has an odd amount of fruit flavor and the bitterness is citrus and woody at the same time.  Interesting, but the pear taste is kinda off to me.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"
