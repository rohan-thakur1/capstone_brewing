In the mouth its not too sweet, but burnt and dark sugars suggest sweetness. The clean, dry finish does it great favours and keeps it from being sickly. Could definitely session this. The body is rather flat, but perhaps they were aiming for the famous carbonation (or lack thereof) of British ales, so Ill allow it!

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts, caramel and nuts; ends slightly bitter and dry with roasted malts and coffee.

Overall:

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. Does everything that a brown ale needs to do. Funny that it says the beer only has 17 IBU, because it feels as more. The aroma could have been stronger, but that is the only flaw.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Mouthfeel is pretty good ( a tad fuller for a Brown) plus side of medium. How awesome can you really make a brown ale?

Equally nutty taste of hazelnuts, chestnuts, peanuts, roasted malt, cocoa, bitter orange, rusty metal and a touch of tartness.

I was disappointed by this over-the-top nutty beer. Beyond a certain level of intensity, the nuts add an astringency and do not se m to blend well with the other bitter flavors in this beer.

2010,"2013-08-14",4.0,"Pours a mahogany brown with a soft gold hue around the edges when held to the light. Has a fat head of loose beige foam that fell slowly enough to a cap and ring. Body is clear and carbonation constantly refreshes. Nose is nits, and toasted malts. Theres a light sweet caramel underneath, some rich toffee and a nice light biscuit. The nutty qualities are diverse and this has more than just peanuts. It shows a little gentle cashew smoothness and a some pecan as well. Touch of saltiness for authenticity. As it warms a hint of cocoa comes out and its toasty. Shows an earthy hop floral on the nose as well. Taste is great. Creamy body that is thin and pretty light for all the fat malt. Toasted, earthy, nutty, light sweetness from the caramel. leaves a dry finish with enough hop bitter at the back and leaves a bit of dark fruit back there too. 

All in all this a terrific nut brown ale thats got a low abv so its great for sessioning. Its a good beer for cooler weather when a fruity hoppy beer is not what you really want. The balance is perfection as per usual with alesmith beers and this one grants enough sweetness to reward the palate and enough bitter to keep you wanting more.","New York, USA","pinkie"

2010,"2013-04-16",3.8,"0.65l bottle. This is a blurry deep dark ruby red beer with a small quite quickly fading and side sticking off-white islandy top. The aroma is not what I would call extreme.

Think I will leave it in the glass for a while to see if it gets a bit more present when it gets some temperature.
OK, it has been in the glass for about half an hour, and the aroma has developed a bit. The roastiness is clearer, and some nice chocolate paper mixed with traces of tobacco has sprung out. It has a really comfortable light almost cloudy mouthfeel this, and the carbonation is about average. Light roasted flavors, it has a nice soft sweetness, traces of cold coffee but Im missing the nutty flavor I was expecting. I have to admit that its extremely light drinkable this.

Perhaps some oatmeal raisin cookie as well.  Its strange, but I enjoy it.  The flavor refutes my previous convictions of infection, as its nothing but an even-keeled journey through roast, cocoa, and toasted nut territory, with no whirlpools of tartness to be found.  Light roasted coffee flits in and livens the party.  The finish is a nice tone of roastiness which lingers well on after consumption.

2010,"2007-11-17",3.3,"Sometimes you find good beer in the strangest places.  Last night, a buddy and I ventured off to a place called the Kava Lounge, Downtown San Diego.  We went to see a DJ (Who is kind of a friend of a friend).  Anyway, the music sucked, the place was strange, but good god they had an awesome tap list.  Anyway, I have had this several times in the past couple years, but have yet to rate it.    Im really not much of a brown ale fan, but needed something to cool the engines last night after having 3 speedway stouts - given the fact that I was the driver and a DUI would have been no bueno.  So, this beer is what it is - an easy drinking, rather uneventful brown ale.   Its probably not smart to have something like this right after a monster beer like Speedway, because Nautical is fairly light and watery.  Not bad, not great.

2010,"2007-10-16",3.7,"In short: Superior yet classic nutty Brown-Ale
How: Hand-bottled flip-top brought to Montreal by WeeHeavySD.  Thanks Jon.
The look: Clear ruby brown body with a short-lived beige head (Im sure a fresh pint on tap would have a good head retention)
In long: Very nutty on the note.  Body felt rather full and presented flavours of toasted nuts, crisp caramel and toasted bread.  Leafy hops were not very tasty and were happy just to do their balancing job without interfering with the malt flavours.  The beer felt creamy yet crisp at the same time.  The carbonation wasnt very lively but that was to be expected with a days-old hand-bottled flip-top.  Despite the hand-bottled this was one of the best session Brown Ale Ive had so I can easily imagine how good a fresh pint from a tap must be.  The bottle we drank was a 3.5 but because of the hand-bottled thing Ill be as generous as an oil tycoon to a republican campaign.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
2010,"2007-10-15",3.4,"My Bottom Line:
This quenching Brown Ale is ripe with nutty caramel and bready tones, a chewy cornucopia of malt flavors for such a low gravity ale which eventually gets balanced out by supporting hop bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the burgundy brown.
-Maltiness reaches chocolate sweetness too.
-The body is lean, but rather round for a beer this gravity.
-I will definitely try this again on tap at the brewery, as it must be excellent fresh.

2010,"2007-04-15",3.5,"draft at alesmith - a tale of 2 beers. immediately at first taste i think of an american brown ale. slightly nutty and sweet toffee-like maltiness with a bit of hop bite. nothing over the top, but prominent. however, as the beer warmed the hop flavor disappeared and the soft nuttiness and sweetness you get from an english brown became more and more prevalent. nice sessionable beer.","Los Angeles, California, USA","DirtyMartini"
2010,"2007-04-04",3.9,"Draught samples at the brewery on 3/23/07Mildly hazy medium-brown with darker cola tints and a bit of chestnut.  Beige head is medium-sized, leaving light lacing and showing moderate-to-strong retention.Crusty bread fills in the small gaps left in the sweet, richly extracted maltiness.  Definitely nutty and filled with light chocolate, faint bits of mild roast and a lingering note of vanilla and light fruitiness (dark fruits).  Warming allows more of the fruitiness to emerge, giving more of a poignant, slightly bitter note and leaning the balance more on the dry side, but the malt never falters and lightly sweet chocolate and caramel continue to soften things and provide a great backbone.  No flaws or alcohol noted, medium to medium-high strength of aroma.Dry, lightly milky chocolate notes combine with soft caramel and light cola/fruit suggestions to give a strong balance to the flavor.  A lightly roasted, almost hazelnut-like flavor adds intrigue through the middle and the beer finishes on a dry note, with some breadiness/toastiness and a dry caramel maltiness, with light suggestions of fresh, green hoppiness that is minimally bitter.  Leafy and with a mild floral/citric quality to it, it adds more complexity without detracting from the main show of the malt.  Very supple texture, as always, from AleSmith, with medium-low carbonation and no flaws or alcohol.  Perhaps a bit too much dry nuttiness/toastiness, but only a minimal complaint.  Otherwise this stuff is very drinkable and very well-done.  AleSmith gets so much attention for their big beers, but their lower gravity stuff is every bit as solid.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The aroma is as advertised, extreme toasted hazelnut, walnut and wheat bread along with hints of milk chocolate, molasses, and other husky esters. The taste is a smooth malty overtone with backing qualities of chocolate syrup (but the beer is NOT syrupy) and a quick hit of plum like twangy flavors. The finish has a note of herbal and piney hops along with a slap of espresso bitterness. The mouth feel is lush and dry, outstanding for a brown ale.

2010,"2003-09-08",2.8,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2003 Very dissapointed by this beer.  The color and head looked perfect when I got it on tap, but when I tasted it, it was a little too flavorless.  A little too dry and not malty enough","San Diego, California, USA","Sickboy282"

2010,"2003-05-10",4.1,"Put a keg of this beauty in my kegerator yesterday and it is a wonderful brew. A deep, dark chestnut brown pour with a creamy off white head. Enticing malty nose redolent with nuttiness with ever so slight chocolate notes. Full bodied regardless of the low abv. Flavor is up there with some of the best browns. Crisp and clean finish makes this an excellent session.","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"
2010,"2003-04-03",4.5,"I had a sample of this on tap at the AleSmith brewery and really enjoyed it. It has a delicous, nutty flavor to it, almost like peanutbutter. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. Beautiful color and head. An excellent ale.","San Diego, California, USA","BeerRunner"

6/2/05: Fresh from the tap of my corny keg...Murky mohogany color with a generous creamy beige head. Aroma is nutty with some cocoa. Flavor followed the nut and cocoa with maybe a hint of smoke with a lightly dry and lightly bitter finish. Palate is smooth, but a little thin. A very easy drinking brew.","San Diego (Mira Mesa), California, USA","papajohn"
2010,"2003-03-14",3.7,"Poured a clear dark brown with a short-lived, thin tan head. Aroma of nuts and malt. Flavor nutty, malty with a light hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Light vanilla and chocolate present as well. Moderate carbonation and a dry finish.","San Diego, California, USA","rodolito"
2010,"2003-02-26",3.5,"Very thick and dark, a very coccoa color to it.  Looked like it would pack alot, but was only 4.8. A nutty buterscotch smell filled the air.  The taste of roasted walnuts and peanuts shared the flavor with the bitter chocolate, which really makes its presence felt halfway thruogh.  A nice crisp finish. A damn fine Nut Brown Ale.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"

2010,"2003-02-24",3.7,"The 2003 Version is here!!!!  A lovely brown color with a light brown head that lasts and lasts.  the flacor is nice and rasty and malty sweet.  just a hint of hops in both the flavor and nose.  the aroma has the roastiness featured quite well.  this is a session beer if ever there was one.  I felt a little weird ordering these ot O'Brien's, the land of IPAs, but i was glad to have it and cant wait to have some more.","San Diego, California, USA","akinm"

2010,"2000-11-22",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2004 Draught @ Papago Brewery
The beer as it spills for the keg into the appropriate container a transparent brown, the head prodigious in size and the texture spumous, the color a toothsome tan with the lace a thick and sticky sheet to obscure the glass. Nose is slightly floral, nice nutty malt sweetness, fresh and crisp with the start somewhat sweet, thickly malted and the top fair to middling in feel. Finish has a nice moderate carbonation and the hops pleasingly spicy as the beer warms to the room and the glass, quite dry and a decent drinking beer, certainly not the worst Brown Ale Ive tasted, but do like most all the other Alesmith beers better than this one, still worth a sample.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
