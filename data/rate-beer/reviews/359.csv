359,"2016-12-29",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed on draft at Moeder Lambic  Fontainas on November 10 with Kathleen. This was listed as Spontaneous Blend #1. The pour is a nice cloudy golden yellow with a thicker white head that falls down slowly, leaving a good bit of lace behind. The aroma is funky for sure. Lots of dusty barnyard, bitter citrus, light fruit skins, and a hint of horse blanket. The flavor is much of the same. Its nice and funky, its got a great sourness to it as well. The dusty barnyard and horse blanket kind of meld together, and it balances nicely. The mouth feel is a little heavier than I would like, but its nicely carbonated and leaves a nice lingeringly sour funk and dustiness on the tongue. Pretty damn good. Well done, Jester King!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

359,"2016-05-20",4.0,"Draft @ ML Fontainas, with a side by side sample of Cantillon Gueuze. Wow, Jester is doing something quite interesting here.
Orangée, léger trouble, col fin blanc.
Arôme au nez léger de funk, petite pointe de grains rappelant presque le rice-crispies, Rétro sur des effluves de cave, toile-vieux cellier, cuir et fin citronné.
Palais est sec avec un léger palais terreux, fruité citronné et herbacé. Touche de douceur en fin de bouche qui est amoindrie par le profil sauvage donné par ce côté coolship que je trouve moins dominant que leur levure maison. Cependant, Jester King assure la maitrise du procédé. Le résultat est très convainquant, ne tombant pas dans loverkill comme nombre de brasseries US qui mise sur le lactique. Je note aussi un fin malté entre céréales et biscuité mais balancés par le côté aigrelet.
