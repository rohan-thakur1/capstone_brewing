3373,"2017-03-16",3.7,"From notes. Enjoyed on draft at Hunahpus Day 2017 on March 11. The pour is a little bit more of a clear-ish darker yellow with a thin ring of white head that seems to stick around for the duration with a good lace. The aroma is actually pretty lax. There is a nice citrus to it, with a hint of hop leaf and a decent malt backbone throughout. There is a bit of lemongrass and a bitter pine with it as well. This is pretty disappointing. The flavor is much of the same. There is citrus present, some light lemongrass. The malts are a little surprising, but the juiciness is half-heartedly there. The mouth feel is a little light and watery with a brighter carbonation and a lingeringly bitter pine and citrus finish. This is decent for a session, but I was hoping for something with a little more to it.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

In the mouth its medium-light bodied, strongly bitter but with enough malt body, a proper balance for these sub-5% ales that are so often thin.

3373,"2016-06-27",3.6,"Cloudy pineapple yellow color. Medium meringue of head. Good carbonation of tiny bubbles. Looks more like a witbier.

Aroma is the grains of paradise (slight) and a oily, woody hop. Perfumey aroma. Hop-forward, to be sure. A little basement must, a little mint leaf. A tiny off-aroma of plastic but I get that with a lot of sesh-IPAs.

The flavor is a pretty standard hop; the malts are prickly bitter. Just a hint of blood orange and lemon zest. The citra hops add a very bitter finish. 

The feel of the beer is a bit pillowy, and with some carbonated bounce. Its a fine, one-note beer that wouldnt be my first choice but could do in a pinch.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

3373,"2016-06-24",3.5,"Taster pour at Sierra Nevada Beer Camp Across America. Aroma is corn chip, strong pine, light resin. Appearance is pale yellow (urine-like) with small white fizzy head. Taste is similar to aroma. Palate is light bodied with thin texture, average carbonation and balanced sweet/bitter, dry finish. Overall, nice, light refreshing session beer with good aroma and taste.","Fremont, New Hampshire, USA","tfontana"
3373,"2016-05-27",3.6,"can. Hop flavored citra seltzer. Meh, too light and carb is too high. The carb takes over, citra is the rest. No malts.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
3373,"2016-05-27",3.0,"Ok session beer. Bit watery for my taste but overall goes down nicely with some hop in the background.

3373,"2016-05-26",3.8,"12 oz. can. Yellow and a little hazy with a medium white head. Smells of nice citra hops. A little grain. Taste also has a nice citra hop flavor. Bright orange and a little lemon. Pleasant cracker and sweet pale malt. Moderate bitterness. Light body. Well carbonated. Tasty and really easy to drink.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
3373,"2016-05-25",3.7,"Crisp dry pine citrus hop aroma. Hazy yellow body topped with a snow white soap bubbly head. Mild bitterness with a dry resin and citrus taste. Clean crisp finish and refreshing.","Foxboro, Massachusetts, USA","rjplumer"
3373,"2016-05-14",3.5,"Can from Colonial Spirits in Acton.
Mostly clear light golden color with a huge persisting bubbly white head. Earthy spicy and pine with a solid shot of tropical fruits, some mineral water, and a touch of crackery maltiness. the flavor is more earthy pine than fruit but they both share the stage. Faint malty character and dryness could be amped up a bit just to counter the shear lupulin presence. Probably my favorite LH beer so far.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
3373,"2016-05-14",3.8,"Can. Funky hop aroma--earthy red onion, garlic, moss--rounded out by sugar cookies and sweet tangerine. Flavor adds some grapefruit pith to this blend, leading with citrus but fading into the sweaty hop notes. Finishes with low bitterness and a flash of citrusy flavor. Very flavorful, clean and crushable.","","PartyFowle"
3373,"2016-05-14",3.8,"Poured a slightly hazy light gold color. Smelled of grassy and piny hops. Tastes mostly of subtle hops and light citrus. While it may lack in flavor, it is super smooth and crisp.","Massachusetts, USA","bavarian81"
3373,"2016-05-06",3.5,"12oz can from Redstone. Pours yellow gold with a big white head. Aroma is light grains, lemon, grapefruit. Flavor is biscuit, lemon, grapefruit. Grapefruit peel bitterness in the finish. Flavors are good, but this is noticeably thin. Still, this might be the best Lord Hobo has to offer.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
3373,"2016-04-28",4.3,"Smells of huge citrus hops with some dry malts on the back of the nostils. Awesome slightly cloudy yellow color me favorite. Taste starts of dry then getting huge rind flavor and bitterness coming through then finishing off smooth and dry. Med body with zesty crisp carbonation. Very tasty session ipa love all your brews thous far looking for a stout from you guys. Nice work.","milton, Vermont, USA","polo_marco"
3373,"2016-04-25",3.2,"12 oz. can without any date coding. Hazy yellow with very thin lasting legs of lacing. Aroma is a great level of lemons, grapefruit and citrus rind. Really promising on the nose. 
The aroma was leading me to believe that I would receive a blast of citrus goodness. Well, it falls flat. The grapefruit is here without a doubt but it becomes overly astringent. And as far as the session IPA style goes, most 4.5% brews come off as watery. This body falls into the same watery classification as does 90 % of all other in the ""session"" category. For me this is mediocre at best.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3373,"2016-03-25",3.6,"Poured from can hazy golden color with a thin fading white head. Aromas of biscuit light honey and fresh Citra hops. Taste is mildly sweet with notes of caramel and biscuit as well as a lingering bitterness.","Middleton, Massachusetts, USA","Chalumeaux"
3373,"2016-03-15",4.1,"Beautifully hopped, with lots of grapefruit and lemon zest. Nice and dry, with a wheat finish. Will definitely buy again.","","HurricaneManda"
3373,"2016-03-13",3.8,"Undated can from Fort Point Market, drunk 3/12/16.Lightly hazy pour is golden-copper with a large white head that settles to one finger with moderately strong retention.Citra is prevalent in the nose, as one would expect from a citra IPA. But its free from cat urine or other ammonia compounds and isnt heavy on the grapefruit rind nor is there any resin. Pretty nice! Lots of biscuit and very light honey with no alcohol or flaws.Great texture emerges from well-attenuated malts and light honey and biscuit character. Lemon, orange rind and hints of softer fruitiness, with dry pineapple. All classic citra, but done about as well as can be. Kind of reminds me of citra sunshine slacker, though less dusty/earthy/weird than that one, but still just as drinkable. Great carbonation and no alcohol or flaws. Gets just a touch too bitter and grapefruit-heavy for my liking, near the end of the glass, but otherwise much, much improvement from LH Brewing.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3373,"2016-03-09",3.8,"From the can. Grapefruit and tropical fruit aromas. Soft with bitter, earthy grapefruit pith front to back. Dry, medium length finish. Not bad.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
