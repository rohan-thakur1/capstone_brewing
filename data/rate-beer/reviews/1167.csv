1167,"2017-04-13",4.0,"750ml growler (thx, Jonathan J.!). Growlered on 2016-04-01. Pours a cloudy blond with a white head. Aroma is dank, tropical fruits. Taste is similar. This one is quite similar to the beers which Twin Sails, Boombox or Superflux brew in BC. Maybe it is just a little bit better balanced than the beers of the mentioned breweries, which is not a surprise taking into account for how long HF brews this. It is definitely not something from the next level of brewing, since, for example, Superflux Colour and Shape b1 and b4 maybe taste even better.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","beerplace"

1167,"2016-11-06",3.9,"Pours an orange, hazed color with a decent, bubbly white head.

Smells of a pleasant tropical crispness, defined by orange pulp, tangerine and lemon zest, topped off by a chunk of juicy blood orange and pineapple. Cakey malts, white bread crust and wet grass, together with a note of blueberry bush build up the subtle malt balance in this, creating a nose which comes very well together.

Drinks silk, incredibly soft with a nice, juice accompanied hop bite, which gets wrapped up by toffee malts with a prevailing, long lasting dryness on the tongue. Drinks very gentle with no indication of the higher abv apart from the noteable malt backbone during the finish.

Tastes of a nice lemon crispness, which gets a fruity quality due to fresh peeled oranges and wet grass with an immediate dry bite. The hop bite gets tamed by the fluffy, soft mouthfeel and bready malts, which turn cakey sweet during the mid palate. Develops a prickly kiwi sourness during the finish, soothed by blood orange and juicy, dry lemon with an ongoing, supportive malt foundation.

Not overly complex but well brewed with an awesomly soft mouthfeel and a pungent, well nuanced hop punch.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1167,"2016-04-07",4.3,"(20 cl on tap @ Mikkeller Bar) Poured at fridge temperature into a Mikkeller signature glass reveals a cloudy golden body with what could easily be two fingers of creamy, white head that shows good retention and leaves beautiful lace. Good regeneration. Initial aroma seems to bring out citra-like hop notes but as it warms I get more lime, which could be Motueka. Further along it gets a bit more resiny. Either way it is - as always - a harmonious blend that brings tropical fruit juice to mind in a good way. Pretty gentle on the palate. Bitterness is marvellously subdued for the style - just lingering as a driness on the palate. The booze kind of shows its fangs ever so slightly on the sides but considering that its 8 pct ABV and with very little residual sweetness its quite impressive how its been integrated in the juice. Society and Solitude is an apt name for this glass that I enjoy standing on my own in the Mikkeller Bar, while the rest of the Copenhagen craft beer society is standing in the bar for another round of Hill Farmstead.

1167,"2015-10-23",3.9,"On tap at The Reservoir, Waterbury, VT.
At least this was poured into closest respected/correct glassware, a snifter.
The appearance was a moderately hazy burnt orange color with a bar pours kind of slim looking film of a white head. Barely any lacing.
The smell had a sweet pulpy grapefruit bursting over some bitter pine and subtle lemon rind.
The taste takes the previously mentioned flavors and adds a nice drying effect on into the aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a good sipping quality about it. Carbonation seemed good with enough harsh bitterness on my tongue to definitely show some great DIPA effects.
Overall, this was a very nice DIPA that I would have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

1167,"2015-08-22",4.4,"Draught at Armbsy Abbey, 8/16/15.Not quite the usual appearance of most Hill Farmsteads. Still looks good, but the haziness is stronger and the head retention/size a little weaker.But as far as the rest of the beer, Shawns done it again...What a subtle, reserved, delicious, drinkable beer. The aroma shows light candied orange peel, lemon zest, a touch of pine underneath and vibrant lime juice notes. Malt is well-attenuated and adds only a touch of honey/bread dough. No alcohol or flaw.The texture is felt first; soft, but with a subtly tight, engaging carbonation. A bit of bitterness emerges, with light lime, white grapefruit and sweet orange all balancing each other. Interesting notes of rose petal, lilac and lemon zest, with dry pine on the finish, showing no resin or acidity whatsoever. Clean, wonderfully characterful yeast and light minerality. Hard to describe why its so enjoyable. The reserved nature is a lot of it, for me. Much like Legitimacy, it isnt flashy or anywhere near overdone. Not a ""big"" beer, which is great. Had a full glass, but demands more. A very thoughtfully done beer!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

There is a fruity grapefruit presence and the IPA notes mesh greatly. The flavor is following in similar fashion. The middle of the body is a little sweet but very well mixed with fruitiness and dryness. The mouth feel is a little thin, and that's about all I can knock it on. Very good imperial IPA.

A - Pours a fuzzy peach color with a nice one and a half finger tall white head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving spotty trails of lace down the sides of the glass.


S - Smells of strong grapefruit pith, fresh cut grass, pale malt and a touch of sweetness. The fruit / grass combo is killer, makes this one a joy to smell.


T - Starts off with the intense fruitiness, mostly grapefruit and other citric rind, slowly giving way to the grassy hop bitterness, pine needles, pale malt and a touch of caramel sweetness. The balance of flavors is great yet intense, hard to pull off. Finish is pretty dry, lingering long after the finish.


M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Fruity, bitter feel throughout with a but if dryness at the end of each sip.

Poured into a HF becker glass.

A-Cloudy orange yellow color with a 2 finger fluffy white head. decent retention and amazing lacing. 

S-Grapefruit, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, some grassy notes, and a feint bready character on the back end. 

T- Huge hop aroma- more grapefruit and mango mixed with some grass and pine resin. This kind of tastes like Abner. There is a big bitter note mixed in with some caramel on the back end. No alcohol or other flaws that I can note. Very close to the perfect IPA in my opinion. 

M- Carbonated to the perfect level. You can barely notice it, indicating it is right where it should be. Dry, but not overly so. The long bitter finish encourages you to keep drinking.

O- Amazing beer. I think this is my favorite of the society series, and maybe of all the HF IPAs and pales I have had so far. Amazing hop flavor and aroma that smacks you in the face but doesnt overtake the malt balance whatsoever. I could drink a 2L growler of this by myself in a night easily, despite the alcohol.

1167,"2013-01-18",4.2,"In short: An intensely grapefruity/citrusy pale IPA.
How: Tap at brewery, Growlers at home.
The look: Cloudy pale blond body topped by a persistent small white head. 
In long: Nose is intensely grapefruity with some other citrusy and tropical fruits hiding in the back.  Taste has the typical pale IPA HF cushiony bready/crackery pale malts totally dominated by the intense fresh grapefruity/citrusy flavor.  No alcohol presence whatsoever.  When first released this beer was the closest thing Ive had to grapefruit juice from a beer.  I had another growler filled at the brewery one or two months later and it was a little less over-the-top grapefruity.  Still, I have a hard time believing that a beer can taste so much like fresh grapefruits without including a actual citrus fruits in the recipe.  When I had it on tap the first time at the brewery (one glass) I thought it was just about the best IPA ever brewed by HF, but after a few growlers I changed my mind, theres a sweetness sensation that piles up when drinking large quantities of this beer, something I never got from HF IPAs.  As excellent as HF IPA should be but a little less easy to drink a full growler than with their best offerings.  Im surprised at how much I have enjoyed the four Society & Solitude Ive had so far, I never had the #1 so I was afraid I wouldnt understand the #2 through #5.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

A - Pours a very cloudy and light yellow body. Never seen a DIPA so light, it almost looks like a murky berliner weisse or something. Massive white head forms with just an unreal amount of sticky lacing and retention. Looks perfect.

S - Mango and grapefruit juice. The smell is just so oily and juicy with a touch of dankness on the very end. One of the best hop aromas I have ever smelled. I typically lean towards grapefruit and tropical notes over the dank/resinous/piney beers so this is just right up my alley.

T - Bitter grapefruit and mango juice. Like drinking a glass of oily and super fresh citrus juice. The taste is just so perfect. Bitterness is intense but never overwhelming and the juicy citrus finishes dry and pleasantly. Again, perfect.

M - Medium bodied with light and prickly carbonation. Highly drinkable.

Flavor has hay, flowers, and tons of citrus, grapefruit.  As is typical of this brewerys takes on the style, this is light on resin and bitter attack, and heavy on herbs, flowers, fruits; on the lighter side, but boldly showcasing its hop foundation.

Slick, medium to heavy palate; finishes with lots of pith and a sweet, floral honey texture.  Its initial curiosities didnt really take off into something memorable, but it was great nonetheless.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Also a touch of spice on the back end. This is sticky. This is great overall. I cant quite explain it, but I fell like it was almost a little restrained. Its huge and delicious, but I feel like it was one step away from perfection. Maybe just a touch more sweetness.

1167,"2012-10-08",4.0,"My Bottom Line :  
Boastful citrus fruit, from grapefruit to starfruit, dominate this Double IPAs aroma and flavor profile, as sand-y allusions (cat litter?) and green resins slowly rise in the second half.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A slice of foam covers the cloudy pale straw.
-The soft effervescence makes the citrus flavors feel even more juicier.
-Alcohol is a no show, which is great.
-I can easily see someone find this tiring if citrus is not a favorite flavor.
