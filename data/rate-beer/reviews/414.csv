414,"2017-04-27",3.4,"Bottle... Pours clear and yellow with a short-lived white head. This cream ale (in a completely uncharacteristic fashion) is all about the hops - juicy melons, muskiness and white pepper. Medium-bodied with prickly carbonation. The flavor offers smooth cereal grains and a modest level of citrusy, musky, rindy bitterness. Finished dry and raspy. An oddity, this one, but tasty nonetheless. Bottle courtesy of ygtbsm94!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
414,"2017-04-14",3.4,"Very light yellow color, but copious head and lacing. Smells like a light IPA, hops, straw, not much else... Taste is hops, straw, grass... bitter with a creamy palate. Its not bad. A perfect craft beer for the summer.","Delaware, USA","Bricks"
414,"2016-06-15",3.2,"A mineral floral hop aroma, pours a clear light gold color with a thin white well laced head. A refreshing taste of floral hops with a dry feel very refreshing with a floral hop finish.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","Luvystypotables"

414,"2016-06-05",3.0,"Clear golden coloured body with a slight orange and copper glow, all with a half centimetre tall rather funky looking tan head. Aroma of rich fresh hops, some subdued grassy and herbal elements and a touch of malt with alcohol. Medium-bodied; Assertive grassy and herbal hoppy flavour with a big kick of alcohol, bitterness and pungency on the finish especially with a touch of fruits, some light grain and a ton of grassy and malt elements noticeable. Aftertaste is deep and bitter from the hops, but more bitterness from the malt shows through. Overall, an interesting beer with a nice aroma, but the flavour and especially the palate leave just a bit too much bitterness and funky flavours from the malt and offensive side of things. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Giant Food in Falls Church, Virginia on 04-March-2016 for US$1,75 sampled at home in Washington on 04-June-2016.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
414,"2016-05-10",3.8,"appearance: clear medium gold, creamy white head, decent lacing.  aroma: big, unique aromas; kind of grassy and peppery like a pils, but with some grapefruit, but also some dense, catty notes; under this is some popcorn and cracker.  taste: 	sharply hoppy at first (peppery), but then the danker hops come out with catty, herbal notes, then some pine, with a subtle but firm malt undertone of cracker and biscuit.  finish: the peppery, dank hops linger a bit, thinning out a creamy palate and keeping things lively.  notes: Creative take on the cream ale, which can be meh. Enjoyable. Bottle from the Beer & Wine Cellar in Rockville, Maryland.","Maryland, USA","JDBaker11058"

414,"2016-04-12",3.1,"Closer to a session IPA than a cream ale, sporting heavy grapefruit and pine aromas. Hoppy throughout, but ends mildly with a soft lightly creamy fade. A good hot weather quencher that delivers lots of hop character sans agressive bitterness. Some nice cornbread notes in the background.","Thomasville, North Carolina, USA","freekyp"

414,"2016-02-02",3.4,"Collab pack. Pours a clear yellow, good white head. Aroma of sweetish pale malt and grapefruit plus dank hops. Faint hint of rubber. Flavor is initially sweetish corny malt, followed by the hops that match the nose. As it warms, the hops go down and the malts come up. There is a hint of something vaguely DMS or rubber like floating up at times, but then disappearing. Not bad, but overall this one wasnt working for me. Needed to be just a touch cleaner I think.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

414,"2016-01-23",3.7,"12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter. The beer is a crystal clear gold color with a white head of foam that dissipates at a moderate rate. The beer has mild tropical fruit notes with a touch of doughy character coming through. Mostly a sweet beer, but there is some dry, floral and mildly piny bitterness as well. Higher carbonation and a lighter body. Pretty interesting beer. Better than the other imperial or double cream ales Ive had in the past.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
