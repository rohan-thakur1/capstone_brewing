3605,"2016-06-23",3.9,"July 19th, 2014 - I come to the end of another Beer Camp box, wrapping up with the There and Back ESB, a frilly, foamy and clear beer with a lot of sizzle and perk. The aroma is light and sweet, with sticky caramel and toffee and a touch of a botanical note, relatively sweet for an ESB. The taste is on the sweeter side, though more mineral tasting up front, with clove and all-spice kicking in later on. Theres also a mineral water finish, with a pinch of those sugared almonds, and ending with a curious whip of smoke. Really excellent and engaging for an ESB, this is a worthy finish to the box.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
3605,"2016-01-24",3.5,"12 oz bottle from Beer Camp series. Pours a mostly clear, deep Amber color and topped by a small layer of off white foam that settles into a thin film. The aroma shows notes of floral hops, hints of citrus fruit, biscuits, toffee and caramel malts. There is also some pine hop resin on the back end. The flavor follows and is malty up front with notes of toasted bread, biscuits, caramel and toffee and balanced out nicely with some floral and piney hop bitterness. Medium bodied and smooth with balanced carbonation that leads to a slightly sweet and bitter finish. Not really my favorite style, but still solid and well done.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

3605,"2014-09-12",3.7,"Box dated 6/19/2014. Beer itself dated 5/22/14.
This was poured into a pint glass.
The appearance was a hazy dark orange to brown color with a one finger white rocky head that held for a good minute before slowly dieing a decent pace. Somewhat speckled and foamy lacing was left in the wake.
The smell has the ""English Bitter"" standard of the light soapy and sticky toffee malts that can be construed as ""bittered"" in a nice way.
The taste was mainly malty sweet through a delicate caramel and toffee crispness.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability to it. The carbonation was mild but still there toying with my tongue but allowing a nice sticky creamy coating of toffee sweetness.
Overall, another winner for the style by SN and New Glarus.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3605,"2014-08-20",3.4,"Appearance: A very brilliantly clear bronze bodied beer with a vibrantly fluffy white cloud head that looks like meringue topping on a pie. Good lacing on the glass. Truly a perfect looking beer. 

Aroma: I get a bit of spicy hop aroma; some woody and wet moss hop character.

Taste: At first it has a very rustic bread quality to it. I get a bread crust flavor followed by a bit of hop bitterness. Perhaps even a rye-like quality to it. I feel it is important to note that all of the malt flavor is bready and there is no caramel-like flavor that I pick up.

Palate: It has a good mild amount of bitterness and a slight twinge from the malt and hops. I would say it rests at an even keel of a medium bodied beer with a slight rough edge.

Overall: Overall it is a good beer. I think it put a good spin on the English Bitter style while keeping things inline. It is very easy to drink and quite enjoyable. I recommend it.","","teromous"

I had higher hopes for a Sierra Nevada / New Glarus collaboration than this. While it was a fine bitter I found it hard to get too excited. Compared to the regular session releases that come out of New Glarus this feels half hearted. Even so it is a good chance for national exposure that I hope translates into more excitement for two world class brewers.

Aroma / Appearance - A caramel semitranslucent base has a short lived head that soon fades to nothing. Red vines, cheap Wurthers hard candy, and cream soda are a shadow that teases the senses. Despite all that it lacks the soul of a bitter that the best examples have.

Flavor / Palate - A blend of light cinnamon, apple pie, and mild bitterness provides an all American take on a British style. The gentle fluid mouthfeel opens up with time. Ultimately though it becomes forgettable until by the time the glass is empty you are ready for a new beer. I cant fault the effort but something here falls short of many of the other offerings in the box.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3605,"2014-08-14",3.2,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours an orange-amber color with a thick one finger white head that has fantastic retention. The head slowly fades over a long time to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
 Smell  The nose of the beer is sweet and malty with tons of caramel and toffee sweetness as well as a good deal of a grainy and toasted bready malt smell. Along with these aromas comes some smells of a sweeter fruitiness as well as a bit of an earthy and piney hop smell.
 Taste  The taste begins much drier then I would have anticipated from the smell with a toasted malt flavor along with just a bit of a more caramel sweet taste. The bit of sweetness that is present upfront fades as the taste advances with just a hint of a lighter butterscotch flavor taking its place. Joining the toasted malt flavor are some flavors of grain and a bit of a hay-like malty taste. Hop flavors are largely absent upfront, but as the taste advances some flavors of an earthy and herbal hop flavor come to the tongue. Along with a little bit of nut and a very light happening of some toffee, one is left with a malty and slightly dank hopped and sweetened flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side for a brew of only 5.6 % abv. For the style and tastes of the brew, which consist of malty and dank hops, the thicker body and lower carbonation level are rather well fitting and make for a nice mouth coating feel.
 Overall  A decent bitter overall, but really nothing all that fantastic.","","Darkmagus82"

The flavor profile is initial soft bitter, moving to a hint of astringent, moving to bread and light floral presence - The hazelnut presence moves to a lingering sweetness near the finish line.

3605,"2014-07-29",3.4,"Pours a light brown amber/copper color, like a redwood stain. The beer might be a touch hazy, or perhaps, its just the color.

A touch of cough syrup. Bready malt, a bit simple but nice. Some fruitiness, mostly strawberries, grapes, cherries and raspberries, but all sweet with no acidity. Mild hoppiness, some sort of herbal, earthy, mineral-ish spice in the background. Taste is fairly sweet. The malt is nice, but the sweetness climbs a bit much and takes on an off character with that cough syrup flavor, which Ive noticed in other English-style beers, as well. That same sweet fruitiness and mild hop flavor. Its a fruity, earthy flavor. Finish dries out some, ending with a mineral finish. Mouthfeel is quite full. Carbonation is fairly low.

There is a subtle malt sweetness hate and a bit of fruit that seems to come from the yeast. It is full bodied and mildly carbonated, which suits the mild flavor in this case. It finishes with form bitterness and some lingering fruitiness. This is a tasty beer.

3605,"2014-07-25",3.7,"Sampled from a bottle, 
this beer had a amber, burnt orange pour and presented an initial large, foamy white and some off-white bubbles that receded to a lasting layer, there was generous carbonation in the glass with many lively streams of bubbles, and it left nice spots and partial rings of lacing on the sides, 

it had aromas of light fruit that resembled raisin and pear, toasted malt, light citrus hops, and some malt sweetness, 

the flavors were nice toasted malt, faint caramel notes and light raisin fruit with light citrus and spice hops, 
the finish had a light hop bitterness with toasted malt following, the bitterness lingers a little afterwards, 

this drink was light and felt a little creamy on the mouth, and it had average carbonation, 

a very nice drink.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"
3605,"2014-07-25",3.7,"Bottled May 22, 2014.
Appearance: The body is clear with a light amber hue. The head is tall, dense and rocky with a light tan hue and good persistence.
Aroma: The aroma is mild with light orange marmalade overtones and hints of malty sweetness. A dash of caramel is noted. The aroma is balanced and smells nice, though it could use more strength.
Taste: Mildly bitter with orange marmalade coming through cleanly over a cracker malt base, slightly toasty with a mild sweet edge to it. Mildly sweet with a lingering mild hop bite on the finish. This is balanced nicely, very drinkable.
Palate: Slightly thick, nearing crisp though with moderate carbonation.
Overall: This should definitely be classified as an ESB, not a bitter. The ABV is off too far to be a standard bitter. Even so, this is a nice beer, one that I put up there with any other ESB that Ive had. Well done.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"
3605,"2014-07-25",3.7,"Nice, bready, woody malt aroma from a clear light orange/copper body with a medium white head. The aroma follows straight into the body with a light creaminess. Theres a dryness around the sides of the tongue and some leafy bitterness that settles in the middle, both of which are a nice contrast to the very light roasted grain sweetness with a touch of corn. At first this seems to be a fairly bland, watery beer, but as you drink it the flavor seems to build until it becomes a very enjoyable brew. By the time you reach the bottom of the glass, you want another one.

3605,"2014-07-17",3.7,"12 oz. bottle from Wilburs. Appearance: finger slightly off-white head that does not last too long, copper color, slightly cloudy, light to no lacing. Aroma: malt, molasses, oats, biscuity, light floral, hay. Palate: light body, average carbonation, bitter finish, oily and sticky texture. Taste: sweet deep malts, that melds into a nice hops bitterness almost too seamlessly. Overall, very nice beer, simple but very well done. My new favorite for the style.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","HIGHB4LL"
3605,"2014-07-17",3.5,"Bottle into a SN glass. Pours a nice copper with a half-inch of off-white head. Aroma is a pleasant mix of cereal, light malty sweetness, and hints of grass, citrus, and roast.

3605,"2014-07-17",3.6,"Bottle # 1 out of 12 from this here Beer Camp Box that I procured from Binnys (thanks again, Alex). Pours a medium golden-amber, generous fluffy white head with excellent retention and lacing. Nose is toasty malt, roasted nuttiness, tad mineral/metallic. Mouth is medium bodied, lightly sweet and malty up front, good balancing bitterness kicks in mid range. Caramel, toasted bread, suggestions of dates and raisins lurking in the background. A very nice Bitter (and I dig me some Bitter... even if its middle of summer and not raining). 1 down, 11 more to go.","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"

3605,"2014-07-16",3.8,"Bottle. Pours with a clear burnt orange hue and a medium sized off-white head with decent retention. Aromas are of citrusy and slightly floral hops, apple peel, toasty, rich base malt, grassy, medium fruity esters. Flavors are fruity, floral, toasty and dry with a long fruity finish. Apples skins, mild stone fruit, herbal citrus flavors of hops and yeast interplay well with a great toasted malt back bone. Nearly neutral balance with a slight nod to bitterness that helps round out the finish. Medium dry (overall, quite dry to style), slightly higher than expected carbonation. Really well made as expected, this might be a top 3 of the 12 pack for me!","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

3605,"2014-07-12",3.8,"12 oz bottle from the Beer Camp Across America variety pack. Aroma is malty, gun metal, root beer barrels (??), floral notes (Im reminded of honeysuckle), earthy. Pours hazy orange with a medium-sized off-white head that falls into a skiff of foam after a minute. Taste starts out sweet before turning spicy, finishing with a mild bitterness; toasty. Perfect palate--finely carbonated, medium body. Okay, once again, as with the Three Floyds collaboration, this is a great tasting finely crafted beer, but given the talent involved, why an ESB of all things? Ive never had the opportunity to try a New Glarus beer and the first thing to reach these taste buds is a fucking ESB?? Now, I love Fullers to death. I was hoping that of the 100+ beer styles out there these two breweries could have collaborated on, they chose ESB for a good reason. I really wanted a Fullers type of quality here if thats what the style they decided on was. This doesnt live up to it. Im rambling now, but the point is, I wanted something along the lines of what New Glarus is famous for, not this. This is good, but I was really hoping for something more in line with what theyre known for. Good beer, though.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"
