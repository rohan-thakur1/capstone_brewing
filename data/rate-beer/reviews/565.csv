565,"2016-11-11",4.4,"Bells Hell Hath No Fury enters some strange territory but it does so with a sense of cohesion. There are a few breweries that have tried pairing darkness with Belgian flavors (Ommegang and Stillwater are the more successful ones that come to mind) but its rarely been so well as with Hell Hath No Fury. Theres notes of coffee roast, char, earth, cocoa, cherry, candy, fruit cake, and Belgian spices. Full-bodied but not heavy feel. Not your typical Abbey Dubbel but a rather tasty one.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Pours a very dark molasses color, nearly opaque, with a massive light crème brulee head that takes minutes to dissipate, leaving mostly clean glass as it decays...light yeasty nose with touches of toffee, faint grapiness...sweet body offers candy or brown sugar and a growing roasty character, with again fairly light yeast throughout, turning to somewhat bitter, a touch drier (thought still somewhat sweet) and burnt at the finish...milky texture to the mouthfeel, strong-ish, lively carbonation.

It?s smooth, with foamy, soft carbonation. The texture is like that of a light weight syrup with a medium body.

565,"2015-10-28",3.6,"Theres no recognized style of Belgian Stout, though if there was I suppose Bells Hell Hath No Fury Ale might be a good example of one. It appears to be a rather typical strong stout thats fermented with traditional Abbey yeast. The net result is a beer thats at worst good, and at best interesting. 

I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 8/28/15 and cost $4.35 ($0.36 per ounce).

Appearance: Dark black body all around. Initially pours to a large, brown, foamy head, but it evaporates quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass.

Smell: Familiar stout scent with notes of roasted malt, but a noticeable fruity presence as well from the yeast esters.

Taste: Since this beer is rather experimental in style, its a little difficult to wrap my head around it. On one hand it tastes like a classic American stout: plenty of sweet dark maltiness along with some roasted notes. On the other hand, its a bit more continental with the presence of rum-soaked raisins, plum, and treacle. I even detect a smokey astringency on the finish. Theres a bit of alcohol in here as well, though its not entirely distracting. I enjoy the sweet and stout-like characteristics here, but that finish is rather odd. All in all, its a fine beer but nothing amazing.

Drinkability: The palette to Bells Hell Hath No Fury Ale is an odd duck to be sure, though the palate itself is not. The mouthfeel is fairly thick, but in no way viscous or sticky. Not quite velvety smooth like a pub stout on nitro; though it is still smooth going down. I do notice the 7.5% ABV in the form of flavor and warmth. It finishes surprisingly clean. Id enjoy this as a dessert.

There is a nice roast and a little coffee. The Belgian dubbel aspects of this are just huge. I'm not a fan at all. Here we go. The flavor is heavy on roast and dark chocolate. There is a definite clove and Belgian yeast. It does fall off pretty quickly. The mouth feel is thin and light with a soft carbonation that you would expect to be much thicker.

565,"2013-03-20",3.5,"Appearance: I poured as aggressively as I could, but it made no difference. Poured like a cola, and the head fizzled away with the sound of one. The color of the beer is just a pitch black, laceless, headless disappointment. Hell Hath No Fury is unfiltered, and some sediment can be seen, which helps a little bit.

Smell: HHNF smells strange, but it smells really good. Such an interesting aroma... I get a clove smell mostly, and some malts. A very sweet smell.

Taste/feel: Has a taste of coriander and clove... it really just tastes a lot like a witbier or dunkelweizen to me, just with a dark malt aftertaste. Keep in mind, Im not at all familiar with the style ""Belgian Strong Dark"", so this could very well be typical. Thats just what I get. It doesnt taste like I thought this would at all -- its very sweet, with a verrry slight bitterness and sourness on the finish (the latter no doubt due to the Belgian yeast). It doesnt have a super interesting depth of flavor, but its still tasty. However, a single bottle is more than enough for me during a session. The sweetness and overall feeling of this one is too thick and heavy for me to have too much of. By the bottom of the glass, it almost feels syrupy.

Decent heft in body. Carbonation is a bit spritzy at times. Moderately thick. The roasted qualities come out in full flavor. Toasted bread, chocolate, and some faint espresso noted.

565,"2012-02-28",2.9,"From notes.  First reviewed 11/23/2010.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip.

Wow, Hell Hath No Fury is a surprisingly dark, mocha brown color with tins of cherry at the edges of the glass. A small, 2 cm brown head forms, but fades rather quickly. A bit of lace spiderwebs on the glass.

Roasted malt character, with muted figs, raisins, and some spices wander into the nose. Mild earthy hops finish.

It tastes like a combination of a Belgian dark and a porter, and maybe the subtlety is lost on me, but the porter takes over and sort of quashes the Belgian dark flavors. Chocolate and roasted malt, sweet toffee, some Belgian spicy yeast notes, and some muted dark fruits up front - I wish these flavors revealed themselves a bit more. Soft earthy hops try to provide a foil, but come up a bit short. Finishes sweet and roasted, with a jolt of alcohol.

The body is very full, and a sticky syrup coats the mouth immediately after the first sip. Light on the carbonation, it seems like it could do with more. 

This was an interesting experiment, and I would continue to try really any new offering from Bells, but the combination of flavors really did not demand that I have this particular ale again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

The finish oscillates back to dark fruitiness and warms all the way down the throat. Thick and smooth in the mouth, with a little overaggressive carbonation, but thats a small nit. Very good stuff when youre in the mood for something a little bolder and sweeter than the traditional dubbel.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
565,"2011-12-13",4.2,"12 oz bottle (10/18/11 on the label, sampled Dec 2011): pours extremely dark brown with a off-tan that collects at the edges, but doesnt go away 100%...aroma like a milk stout: roasted chocolate malts and bitter tanins...subtle banana undertones.  Great, lively palate attached to fruity plum and roasted coffee flavours.  One of the first unique beers I have had in ages...the combination of roasted malts and sweet fruit combines the things I like most from stouts and Belgian Dubbels: the roasted aroma of the stouts and the raisiny fruit flavour of the dubbel...this works!

Roasted notes follow this with some very light chocolate and dark fruit notes. Finishes with a slight hot alcohol kick. Body is thick with a modest carbonation rate the consists of fine bubbles.

565,"2011-11-28",4.1,"12 ounce bottle - $2.99 at Total Wine & More in Alpharetta, Georgia. Batch #10735.

Appearance: Pours a dark brown, near black body with a moderate-sized, beige head.

Smell: Roasty and fairly sweet-scented all around, implying sugary promises of gooey chocolates and caramels rounded with cooked fruits, phenolic spices, drizzled molasses and a small shot of alcohol.

Taste: Sweet chocolate morsels and coffee dosed with a fair amount of table sugar evolve into tastes of smoky molasses brushed berries, plump raisins, toasted pumpernickel, cracked cloves, and understated resins. Restrained bitterness. Some burnt caramel opening up as it warms. Drying, fruity, spicy finish thats reasonably smooth.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation. A little bit chewy, even.

Overall: Something different, I liked it, and the overall flavor profile made me think of a Schmaltz anniversary brew. I went in a bit uncertain of the style, merely buying it as Im a fan of Bells, but enjoyed the malt-forward, stout-like elements blended with the Belgian qualities for a beer that seemed bigger than the listed 7.7%.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

It ours a dense, dark brown/black with a foamy tan head that sticks for a good bit. It is very firm and persistent. 

The smell is kind of all over the place. It almost reminds me of a dunkelweizen rather than a belgian strong dark. It has a significant amount of bubblegum and banana in the scent. There is also some fruitiness and clovy spice. There is the slightest hint of black malts.

The flavor is all over the place as well. Lots of bubblegum, some chocolate, clove, coffee. It just isnt a flavor that i can get in tune with.

The mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery.

A - Dark mahogany with a smaller than average, creamy, sticky, sandy head. Average retention with a nice layer of lace left.

S - Usual Belgian Dark Ale. Sweet dark malt, with a nice molasses and dark candi sugar sweetness. A nice bubblegum, and some phenol aroma. Hints of dark fruit, but not as much as I would expect. Also some sweet chocolate in there.

T - Less of a dark Belgian ale flavor than the nose suggest, and a little less flavorful. Still dark sweet malt and molasses/dark candi sugar, but it is more subdued. More chocolate and some coffee flavors coming out compared to the nose. Also a healthy amount of yeast comes out in the flavor, especially toward the finish. Phenol flavors moderate strength with only a little bubblegum. Malt, chocolate, coffee, and yeast all together outweigh the rest of the Belgian flavors. Some Belgian spice (especially clove) also present.

M - Moderate body with about average carbonation. Pretty smooth and creamy feel. Really nice feel.

D - Pretty drinkable with nice flavor (although a little lacking). Great body and feel though. Easy to drink and has a nice lingering taste.

Notes: Not a bad BSDA, and definitely had potential. Unfortunately the taste fell just a bit short for me. As it warmed, the flavor improved and had more Belgiany flavors (outside the yeast which was always pretty strong). I liked it, but probably wont get it unless it is on sale. Worth a try though.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

This one packs a punch in a good way, tastes like a high ABV brew but not in an overpowering way.  Smooth with a bit of a bite in terms of a slight spice appearance, with the Belgian yeast, coffee, and clove present in the mix.

Body is lighter than anticipated with a nice touch of black malt, burnt, and, surprisingly enough, a distinctive smokiness.

565,"2010-10-12",2.8,"I am always sort of fascinated by things that are exactly equal to the sum of their parts. Here we have a strong porter or perhaps a strong dry stout brewed w/ a Belgian yeast. It tastes pretty much exactly like what youd expect such a thing to taste like, which is neither as bad as you might fear nor as good as you might hope. The appearance is definitely that of a stout, nearly black w/ a tan head which lasts just a minute and leaves behind only a few spots of lace. Clove-like Belgian fruitiness is backed by a coffee-like roasted grain character. The flavor is pretty much the same mish-mash, paired w/ a medium to heavy body w/ somewhat spritzy carbonation. No magic--for good or for evil--comes to be as the joining of these sets of flavors.  Honestly, the main good I think this might do in the beer world is saving a few open minded homebrewers the trouble of doing something like this themselves just to see.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

There are licorice and raspberry flavors that I wasnt expecting. Its sweeter without quite enough complex yeast flavors, but its still rather enjoyable. A little thin for the style.

This pours damn near black. I wasnt quite expecting that. Big espresso foam colored head. Retention is fairly good. Lacing is all the way around and slightly sticky.

This smells like a cake in a glass. Very yeasty and sugarey. Huge brown sugar presence. Lots of molasses, also. Dark fruits, mostly figs, wrapped in caramel. A decent level of maltines comes through. Mild hints of chocolate.

Taste is very dark and not nearly as sweet as the nose leads you to believe. 
Roasted malts come out, in a big way. Lots of dark fruits are here, but they are covered in bittersweet chocolate and sprinkled with ground coffee beans. Mild notes of molasses and licorice.

The feel is smooth, but the carbonation is wrong, for this style. Way too sharp and cutting. This should be much creamier.

If this one were creamier, it could be a go-to beer. As it is, its a bit too sharp to enjoy all of the time.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","coldmeat23"

It is tasty, and the ABV is well hidden until right at the very tail end of the palate.  Its an almost metallic quality that Ive encountered in a few beers of late and makes me wonder if something hasnt gone slightly wrong with this one.  Still, the emphasis should be on ""slighty"".

565,"2009-08-08",3.9,"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.


Certainly a terminology all of us are familiar with. Bells Brewing out of Comstock, Michigan fully understands that there is no hell like the hell born of a woman scorned, hence their delightfully dark and stormy ale, Hell Hath No Fury. One of the few beers of Bells I have not quaffed yet, it was graciously gifted to me by a near and dear beer friend. Truly, friends are one of a beer geeks greatest assets. That being said, enough blathering, it is time to get to drinking.


She descended a deep dark brown with a furious head of brown thunderclouds hanging low and ominous upon my helpless person frozen in fear. As I hunker down for the long haul, she crackles across my glass with veritable lightning strikes of brown lace. Like all Bells beers, she is not filtered, so I make sure to further aggravate her person and gaze in lip-smacking delight as little chunky bits float suspended, dissolving slowly as they descend to the bottom of my glass. With no end in sight, her nose slaps me in the face, splitting a huge grin of delight from ear to ear. Prunes, prune juice, black licorice, figs, plums, black cherries, pineapple raw and spiky, and bakers chocolate ride atop a wave of graham crackers, pure cracked cacao beans, tobacco leaves which exude cigar humidor esters, and finally, tree bark, dry and earthy. Heavy and rich, I wilt under the weight, descending into her blackish brown depths where none have escaped. Immediately mouth-coating, she doesnt leave much lace, but instead a thin film of brown tears immediately coat my glass. Prunes, prune juice, figs, dates, and pitted black cherries lead into licorice root and tobacco leaves that linger long into the finish. Licking my lips, I revel in creamy milk chocolate, truffle powder, and brilliantly bitter bakers chocolate. As my palate slowly starts to dry, earth and bark keep me grounded as her watershed of exhilarating flavors threatens to sweep me away. If this is Hells Fury, then I have nothing to fear but fear itself. Each quaff layers on the brown tears while she sticks to the back of my throat with further tobacco leaf notes. I would love to pair this beer with a hearty, rich, and earthy cigar. A faint presence of spice lingers in my breath, a final kiss as I bid my Hell Hath No Fury good-bye.


I had no idea what to expect going into this beer, and everything was a pleasant surprise. While no one in their right mind would ever want to cross the wrong woman, I will gladly cross this one any day of the week. I lived through the storm once; I am sure I can weather another and another and another.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

As the beer warms up some dark fruits start coming through.  The medium carbonation and soft mouthfeel may not feel very Belgian but the flavours elements are very cohesive and spot-on.

565,"2009-03-17",3.7,"Bottle, batch 8739.  Pours a really dark mahogany brown with a glint of chestnut translucency at the outer edges.  The head is foamy and tan in color, receding quickly to a wispy film and leaving minimal spots behind.  The nose has alot going on, and shows more like a dubbel/porter hybrid than anything else, I would say.  Darkly roasted caramel and hints of smoky molasses are accompanied by notes of worn leather, tobacco, and earthen dark fruits.  Dark cocoa malts and hints of espresso beans bring in some of the aforementioned porter elements.  Flavors show more of the same, walking the tightrope between sweet and earthy dark fruits and choco-caramel roast.  The palate is smooth and substantial, hitting sweet peaks and dry valleys en route to an ultra-long, roasted finish.  Rating to style, this would not score well.  But I rate to my liking, and this is tasty stuff.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

565,"2009-02-22",3.5,"When i first had this (fresh) something just wasnt balanced right.  The dark fruits were almost fighting against the heartier, chocolate and malty flavors.  Just a little age (its Feb 22 and this was brewed on Sept 22) has done it well.  The aroma is still an even balance of fruit and chocolate but the flavor is now primarily chocolate with a creamy palate.  It actually reminds me of a chocolate malt, like you would get at DQ.  The dark fruits are still there in the background, helping to balance and round out rather than confuse.  This is definitely not a standard abbey dubbel, so if thats what youre looking for steer clear.

lots of chocolate in the flavor along with caramel, dark fruit/raisins/cherries/plums, molasses(what?), coffee, florals and some cola (im thinking cherry coke, maybe dr. pepper)... theres an ashy charred note toward the finish which leads to a bunch of luscious rich coffee in the aftertaste. the medium body is slick and full of soft carbonation which makes the mouth feel crazy creamy.

Pours dark, dark brown with only the slightest amount of light passing through the edges. An aggressive pour produced a one-inch thick mocha head that dissipated to a small ring immediately leaving very little lacing.

The smoke is most distinctive part of the aroma as it is present throughout. There are also some dark roasted malts and chocolate with some sugary sweetness and dark fruits on top. All of this is underpinned by hints of yeast in the nose.

The taste starts out much sweeter than the aroma indicates with lots of candi sugar and dark fruits. The are generous sweeter dark malts and sweet chocolate in the middle. The smoke comes back in the finish and lingers on the palate between sips along with a hints of spices.

The mouthfeel is smooth with decent carbonation and has a dry, smoky feel in the finish.

565,"2008-11-20",3.6,"Based on the description, I expected a somewhat light beer.  Boy, when I poured it, I was surprised.  Dark, with a tan head.  Aromas of dried fruits and sweet roasted malts. Flavor is fruits, with a dose of chocolate. Another success from Bells.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
565,"2008-11-19",4.6,"I hate to gush but what an amazing beer!  Rich, smoky deep flavors that keep going and going.  Plenty of everything including a gorgeous brown head, sweet malt, medium hopped, and carbonated slightly more than average.

Medium-body, initial taste of deep roasted malt, some coffee and ripe fruits.  FInishes bittersweet, kind of a black licorice taste with a slight warming feeling.  Like countless others have said this is very complex and its hard to tell what taste Bells was going for.  Not bad though and certainly worth a try.","Macomb, Michigan, USA","johnnyoski"

Tastes of chocolate, molassas, fruit, and coffee.  Dry finish.  Weird mixture of sweet and bitter.  Read a number of the previous posts.  Glad to see that others agree that his is one strange beer.  All sorts of flavors mixed together.  Been wanting to try this for awhile and Im glad I picked up this 6 pack, but Im not in love with it.  Its like all the complexity gets mushed together and what is left is a hard to define.  I’ve drank two now.  Hopefully Maybe I’ll learn something new when drinking the last four.","Coldwater, Michigan, USA","wmubronco1992"
565,"2008-10-31",3.5,"First off, is this really an abbey dubel? Huh? Pours a deep brown with a creamy light brown head. Aroma is very smokey and malty with some pronounced oatmeal and dark roasted barley. Some leather and very earthy. I didn’t really get any fruitiness, maybe some raisin, maybe. Flavor is very sweet malty. Some of the smokiness carries into the flavor. Lots of baked biscuit or cookie flavors. Has a bit of a spice kick towards the finish that is abbey dubel-esque. Finishes very sweet and doesn’t really linger. Medium-full body and low-average carbonation. Not a bad beer but just very strange. Tastes like this beer is fresh from the oven!!!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","FunkyBrewster"
565,"2008-10-30",4.1,"Pours a very dark brown (complete with suspended yeast), with a lacing, tan head.  Sweet aroma of freshly ground coffee definitely doesn’t scream Belgian Dubbel to me, but nevertheless is excellent.  Big mouthfeel, lots of roasted goodness here, brown sugar, coffee, bread, its all in there.  Great finish...  the worst part is when its all gone!  One of the best I’ve had in a while!","Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","f351c4v"
565,"2008-10-29",3.7,"As a dubbel, this beer is puzzling.  As a beer, it’s pretty damned good!  It doesn’t meet some of what I’d expect from a dubbel, but has other nice aspects that most dubbels lack.  So, I’ll judge it as it is.  Nose is really quite nice.  Sweet and rich, with strong notes of chocolate and a hint of  maple syrup.  Flavors are brown sugar, spice and dark fruits, with a nice carbonation.  

If considered as a dubbel, this beer might perplex.  And I’m willing to bet that its ratings have suffered for such a label.  But it is quite good, and one I’ll likely seek out again.","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","WabashMan"
565,"2008-10-29",3.3,"Strangest tasting beer I have had from Bells.  This does not taste much like a Abbey Dubbel to me.  The aftertaste is actually much better than the beer itself.  I might have drank this one at a temperature that was too low to bring out the complexity of the brew.  A mildly smokey flavor.  It definitely has some cherry fig and prune undertones.  The first sip of this beer was not pleasant but by the end it developed into a interesting mashup.  Pours way to dark for a Abbey Dubbel with a small medium tan head.  Carbonation is minimal and kind of flat.","Apple Valley, Minnesota, USA","tedovertu"

Another impressive brew by Bells, and welcome back to Illinois!","Saint Charles, Illinois, USA","gws57"
565,"2008-10-27",3.4,"Tap @ Hopleaf. Poured dark, which was unexpected. Nice bubbly like brown head. Aroma of barley, malt, spice,  maple, and sugar. Flavor sugary at the start, roasty, chocolately. Hints of barley, nice malty backbone. Fruity (raisens and figs). Medium bodied. Carbonation was solid, as it tingled my tongue every so often. Easy to drink.

565,"2008-10-25",3.5,"I would say this beer is best described as a mind fuck It’s label says it’s a dubbel, but it looks kinda like a stout. The flavor is sweet and subtle kinda like a heffet. I don’t know, maybe I haven’t had enough dubbel’s. Despite all this, I really like this beer. It’s definitely the most perplexing beer I’ve ever had, but what can you expect from a brewer that has a place called the Eccentric Cafe. Cheers!","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","BeerBaron617"
565,"2008-10-25",3.3,"12oz  bottle, pours a really dark brown, close to black... has a tan head that dissipates quickly.  Flavors of chocolate, malt, coffee, cinnamon and smoke.  Starts a touch sweet and finishes dry.  Relatively low carbonation, which is good for this style.  This is a good beer, but the Belgian dubbels (e.g. Westmalle, Chimay Rouge) are far superior.  At $15 per 6, it’s also a bit expensive.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","illkarate"
565,"2008-10-25",3.5,"Woopty Woop! Great name, great beer. Pours a thick muddy dark brownish black colour with no head. Lacing left behind is sticky, resinous and turns crusty within a couple minutes of emptying the glass. Aroma is of smoke, oak, black licorice, coffee beans and earth. Taste is full, sweet, thick on the palate- again dark fruits and bbq, coffee notes and caramel. I only drank half of it before i accidentally kicked it all over the living room floor.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","phishpond417"

Bells may very well be on top of that Michigan list and Hell indeed has some fury.  Thick brown to black in color with a beige head that slowly fades away as I wait for this to warm just a touch.  Aroma is Dubbel all the way with fruit, raison, nuts, brown sugar and toasted malt.  Complex is the cliché, and complex it is.  The taste is solid with brown sugar, fruit, nuts and spice.  Sweet, but not too sweet, just another in the long line of quality beers from Kalamazoo.","Oak Creek, Wisconsin, USA","esjaygee"
565,"2008-10-24",3.5,"UPDATED: FEB 1, 2009 Bottle.  Aroma of yeast, candy sugar, bread, banana, raisins.  Black in the glass with an average sized light tan head that mostly diminished and left some lace.  Flavor is sweet and malty with yeasty musk on the short finish.  Palate has a watery light-medium body with some soft-lively carbonation.  Not bad for a Eurotrash style.","Saginaw, Michigan, USA","polomagnifico"
565,"2008-10-24",3.6,"Bottle. Dark colored like a porter, with a somewhat bubbly espresso colored head. Flavor is bready malts, candy sugar, some yeastiness, banana, raisins, ripe fruit.

Yum.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","WisconsinBeer"

Body is creamy with medium carbonation.","Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA","Tripplebrew"

Pours dark brown with a brownish-tan head, nose incorporates carmel and smokey malt, flavors of smoked malt with coffee and cacoa, finishes bitter with more smoke.

565,"2008-10-22",3.7,"12oz bottle courtesy of Gurst.  Pours a deep brown with a big but fleeting tan head.  Aroma is sweet and full, with hints of dark fruit, chocolate, brown sugar, and a slight bit of syrupy hops.  Taste is full and smooth, with an initially sweet flavor of chocolate, brown sugar, and coffee giving way to a crisper finish of roasted malt, warming alcohol, anise, and spices.  As much stout as dubbel with lovely results.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","WallyWalrus"
565,"2008-10-22",3.8,"A definite anise-like aroma that reveals hints of toasted pecan and apple. Appearance is like that of cola with a deep tan head that quickly dissipates.
A remarkable flavor best likened to that of the acidity of cold press but with rich, savory, and smokey notes finishing into a thin minerality. Certainly a departure from the usual Dubbels, lacking the characteristic butterscotch-sweetness and light carbonation.
Hell Hath No Fury has a dense and complex flavor - match it with an equally complex cheese, maybe Grayson or Selles sur Chere.","Minnesota, USA","Elizavyeta"

565,"2008-10-22",3.6,"Bottle.  Hazy brown body with a thin, quickly diminishing tan head. The aroma is fruity and sweet with only a faint undertone of hoppy bitterness. Plums, raisins, brown sugar, ripe apples, whole-grain bread, fruity esters and a bit of cocoa. The body is full and smooth, with an elegant velvet sweep across the tongue. Starting sweet, the flavor shows malty depth all the way through. Sweet up front and transitioning into a nice, mild roasted malt finish. The alcohol is mostly imperceptible, but does lend a bit of licorice and a pleasing warmth. A different, but enjoyable, beer. Another good option from Kalamazoo.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

565,"2008-10-21",3.9,"(bottle) Pours dark brown with a tan head.  The aroma is more like a weizenbock than an abbey dubbel, with a lot of chocolate, clove, and dark fruits.  Banana lurks underneath as well.  There’s also this light tart scent which I believe is wheat, and further leads me to believe this is a weizenbock.  This sometimes lends a lemon-like component to the aroma.  The taste is quite nice, a lot of dark fruit, candi sugar, banana, and chocolate. There’s a slight roast component here too.  The finish is lightly yeasty with that tartness in the aroma now showing up in the finish to give it a crisp ending.  Really quite drinkable.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

565,"2008-10-20",4.1,"A little underrated, this one was quite tasty. Pours a nice, deep purple, with a red hue. Minimal, but nice, lacing. Aroma is awesome, yeast, candy sugar, clove, and dark fruits. Flavor was quite the same, lots of yeast, with strong candy sugar and fruits. Nice touches of clove and spice. Maybe a dash of bannana and chocolate. Also noticed some barley notes. Very thick, with a creamy mouthfeel that never became overly sticky. Almost like biting into fruitbread. Delicious.","Indiana, USA","StFun"
565,"2008-10-20",3.5,"$13.99 a sixer and looks almost as dark as Expedition Stout and with a similar minimal brown head. I’m not sure I’ve ever had an abbey dubbel but I certainly enjoy this one. Feels luxurious in the mouth and tastes, as others have described it, as a bit roasted and spicy. There’s a lot of nuance here but I can’t see myself spending $13.99 for a sixer of this again (maybe when I’m rich--that’ll be the day).","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","lweiberg"

565,"2008-10-18",3.7,"When I poured it, I immediately knew I shouldn’t have put a bottle in the fridge. Aroma is almonds, other nuts, molasses, fruit, maybe some tobacco.

Roast and chocolate, maybe some oatmeal, dark fruits, lightly nutty.  Finishes slightly smokey.    Long lasting coffee dry bitterness.   Reminds me of a dark-chocolate covered chocolate girl-scout cookie.  A little too weird for me, its either the alcohol or yeast that really throws it off.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"

Strong espresso, smoke, candi sugar, wood, yeast, dark fruit and alcohol.  All these combine to grab the taste buds with an initial zing that fades a bit in the mouth.

Sticky caramel ring of head, even on plasic cup.  Aroma is raisin and prunes.  Little bit of alcohol in the nose.  Creamy roasted maltiness with the underlying Belgian yeast we’re familiar with.

Moderately thin mouthfeel. Toasted flavor comes through moderately strong, clove, coffee, and leaves with a dryish, moderately bitter finish. Seems a little more like a mild stout than the yeasty, fruity dubbels that I’m used to.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","MatSciGuy"

Smell is a bit of smoky, roasty malts.  Only a hint of the typical belgian yeast characteristic is there.  Really difficult to put my finger on this one.  You get a lot more of the Dubbel flavors, characteristics in the taste.  Mouthfeel is a bit bigger as well.  This is entirely different than anything I have ever had, and I kind of like it.  
There is a bit of dark fruit, raisin flavors.  Also a bit of a cola flavor as well.  Decent, full mouthfeel.  Decent beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AllAboutStout"

Flavor is very roasty with notes of dark fruits, brown bread and some bitter sweet notes as if some one dipped a slightly rotting strawberry in bakers chocolate. Once again Bells does not disappoint but come on an Abbey Dubbel, more like an Abbey Stout.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"

565,"2008-03-08",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 27, 2008 Re-rate.  8739.  12oz.  Pours pretty dark brown/black, certainly Porter territory with a small, off-white head with poor retention.  The darkest of the style I have seen thus far.  Aroma is plum, chocolate, spicy, burnt sugar, slight popcorn.  The popcorn component is not buttery or diacetyl related, it is more like a burnt popcorn when you leave it in the microwave too long.  Interesting aroma overall, pretty roasty/chocolatey for the style but some estery fruity notes are definitely hidden underneath.  The taste is winey, fruity with a slick, smooth, thick mouthfeel.  Quick finish, quite slippery this one feels on the tongue.  This is like a good marriage of stout and Dubbel.  Super smooth and creamy.

The nose is roasty, grainy, and chocolatey with notes of caramel apples, raspberries, raisins and red wine and wine yeast. The flavor isnt very inviting, mostly because its overly sweet and lopsided. Mild spice is introduced just as mellow roast takes a nosedive under caramel malt. hints of smoke quickly succumb to the fruity onslaught. On the backside, roast returns and leads into an off-dry finish. Roasted grains, dark fruits and alcohol burn linger, as well as touches of smoked tobacco.

The flavor is roasted choco, some even burnt choco, light ash, dark fruits, licorice, dry light sprucey / pine needle type spices at the end. Mouthfeel is a little acidic and dry, perhaps not as fully attenuated as it could be, yet not candi-sugared up.

Finish is sweet and tart with dark fruits, roast, and alcohol. This is the 6th of a six pack I bought a LONG time ago. I didnt have a problem drinking the first 5 beers, but I never got around to rating this. Im sure many people have mentioned that it is not to style for an abbey dubbel, but that doesnt bother me in the least. My rating is based on my enjoyment of the beer and despite being a nice drinking beer, it is fairly simple and the roast seems to muddle the other flavors.

Aroma brings red wine, dark chocolate, yeast, sweet cherry and dark fruits. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, light but full, small bubbly carbonation (bottle conditioned?). Rings of lacing form and then melt away. Flavor is dark chocolate on top of Belgian yeast dark fruitiness. Dark chocolate merges together wonderfully with the sweet and dark fruit taste. Ive drank stouts that have tried to merge the chocolate and fruity flavors together but this beer does it much better presumably by skillful use of the yeast and elimination of the roastiness and coffee flavor of the stouts.

565,"2007-05-18",3.7,"12oz bottle that poured out dark and very stout like with light brown head. I noticed a brown slick of sediment left behind in the bottle. Initially the aroma is stout like with malt roastiness, sweetness and smoke. Then I get a bit of spice and yeast and alcohol and faint lemony tartness and some funk. Like the aroma the flavor starts with rich molasses sweetness, some malt roastiness and some fruitiness. Then near midway I get some tart notes along with a hint of Lambic funk and a sense of alcohol. As the finish of the taste approaches a plum note becomes more pronounced. Once that begins to fade I get a burlap sack sense. Into the after taste a very nice stout flavor returns with sweet molasses mixed with highly roasted to burnt malts. Very interesting brew with lots and lots going on.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

After passing this one over many-a-time, today I decided to give it a try and I left feeling quite pleased although Im sure the 9% the Fury packs helped me out. The beer poured an opaque black with a creamy, inviting tan head which faded to a small ring around the glass. The initial smell is roasted malts and coffee. At first the taste followed and then a cola-like sweetness developed about half way through. Not as thick as some of the others like Expedition (mmm!), but still a solid body on this one. The cola flavor also became evident in the smell as did a tangy sour extension to the roastiness.

565,"2007-03-17",3.4,"Pretty good beer.  Lots going on, maybe too much.  Sweet spiceyness, like jamaican BBQ(not the heat of course).  Molasses with some all spice noted malts?? is that right.  my guess.  seems to be a porter to me.","Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, USA","Spliffy"
565,"2007-03-17",3.5,"Sampled February 2007
Pours with a three finger thick, light brown cooled head that sits atop a perfectly porter colored beer.  That is the beer is quite dark, really almost a perfect black color, that showed a dark brown, clear hue as I was pouring it.  The aroma has fruity notes of plum to it up front, plus some roasted / burnt notes to it.  Some faint earthy spice notes round things out; a sort of damp earth and clove amalgam of aromatic notes.

The beer is quite sweet and thick, in fact it is very chewy.  Way too thick for a Belgian Dubbel, but hey this was already a beer outside any stylistic guides from the get go.  The flavor is finished off by a burnt fig / raisin note, as well as notes of blackened caramel.  While this is fairly sweet, I would not describe it in any way as saccharinely sweet.  Instead the sweetness is from a plethora of complex malt sugars, which also serve to make this beer quite chewy.  Light notes of clove, a touch of allspice, some hints of white pepper all fight to be noticed as they are buried underneath all of the malt.  The malt character is at times toasty, definitely caramel like, with touches of toffee and burnt bread crust, really it reminds me in some ways of a traditional, black, German, holiday sweet bread.

If I had not been forewarned, I would have been sorely disappointed in this beer as it is so far from a traditional Belgian Ale, much less a Dubbel.  Having said that though, I actually enjoyed this brew.  Its biggest flaw is that it is too thick, it is almost a meal and even calling it chewy underestimates it.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
565,"2007-03-16",3.8,"12 oz bottle, courtesy of StompBrockmore - pours almost black and without the huuuuuge head that usually complements a dubbel.  Actually resembles a stout.  Tons of floating chunks that settle and coat the bottom of the glass.  Aroma of dark fruits and some smokiness as well - very faintly yeasty, as befits a dubbel.  Has that dry roasty finish of an imperial stout as well.  Sweet roasted malt, dry cocoa and some very subtle spice in the mouth.  Sort of thin mouthfeel.  Alcohol is present.  Really seems like a strong yeasty spiced stout rather than a dubbel, but hey, names are just names and this is pretty darn delicious.  I like it!","Parkdale, Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","VeloVampire"

I thought this was going to be an IPA--probably my mental confusion with the recent Tyranena Bitter Woman From Hell Extra IPA.  So when it came out black with a large dark brown head...whoa.  This is a kitchen-sink brew: not that it is going down the kitchen sink but rather that there is everything except the kitchen sink in here.  Molasses, smoke, hops, candi sugar; dark fruit is overwhelmed.  Tastes more like the Bells Batch 6000 (Double IPA/Barleywine + Imperial Stout).

I smell a fair amount more than what I think I should get with a dubbel.  This is a bit too cold right now, but before warming it up all I really smell is Belgian yeast and roasty malts.  After warming I get dark fruits (raisins and figs), faint honey, a bit of char.  Flavor has char up front with some roasted malts, some vinous presence that makes the alcohol wamer than it probably is.  The yeast takes a bit of a back seat to the big roast, though the fruits fare a little better.  Body is medium with soft carbonation.  Not too bad of a beer at all.

Some yeast in the nose, as well.  Impenetrable black color, fully opaque with a fading, tan head and minimal lacing.  Flavor is about what the aroma would suggest, roasty and full of semi-sweet chocolate character, a degree of tanginess noted here, along with more molasses on the finish and suggestions of black walnut, fig and a certain unfamiliar spiciness.  Smoothly carbonated and drying mouthfeel, with a long-lingering roasty aftertaste.  Body is medium-full.

565,"2007-01-07",3.7,"The first thing I notice about this heavy dark brown brew is that it sort of looks like a porter and lacks the large head that I expect from a Dubbel. No matter, Im more concerned with how it tastes. The aroma is at once sort of chocolatey while hinting at a bit of dark fruit and sweet bread. The flavor is somewhat yeasty but not really Belgian tasting. Hints of chocolate, almond, brown sugar, and fresh bread come through the most. Lively carbonation tickles the tongue with each sip. I wouldnt guess this one to be a Dubbel but I still found this incredibly enjoyable.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","Magjayran"
565,"2007-01-06",3.7,"12 oz bottle
This was picked up on a run to Kentucky since the price was right ($1.50).  I may have to pick up some more before supplies dry out - this was an excellent Abbey Dubbel from someone I would not have expected it from.  Granted, most Bells releases are solid so maybe I should not have been so suprised.
Aroma / Appearance - The tropical nose released roasted malts, peaches, hazel, cocoa and berries to my eager nose.  The body giving off these wonderful scents was a deep brown with a sandy head.
Flavor / Palate - A creamy thick mouthfeel coated the insides of my mouth.  The first hit was pure coffee but it soon faded to cream, smoke, chocolate truffles and raisins.  In some ways it felt more like an imperial stout than an abbey dubbel.  The aftertaste was very smoky with a trace of peanut butter and cherry liquer.  Despite being extremely dense it was also easy to drink.  While still a sipping beer, this is one that you do not need to spend an hour on unless you want to enjoy the complexity.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

565,"2006-12-29",3.1,"2006 bottle consumed on 11/22/06Medium-beige head is rather well-aerated/fluffy, only about one-finger in height and recedes to cover fairly quickly.  Retention is moderate, not as great as is usual from Bells.  Still, sediment I present on the bottom, and the beer is a dark maroon-purple-mahogany, with crimson and beige hues as well.  Pleny of carbonation in the liquid.  Light lacing left on the glass.Dry roast and peppery phenols dot the nose as first with a definite helping of bananas overtop mushy walnut/almond flavored brown bread.  The roast helps enliven or harden, I should say, the otherwise sluggish maltiness, while little hops are present, as it should be.  Reminds me of the wheat series, particularly wheat 8.  Nothing over-the-top in any category, and some definite berry skins, clove, banana and light raisins as expected from a dubbel.  Warming brings with it a light touch of fusels, but I see this in almost every dubbel Ive ever had.  Not incredibly aromatic, with the phenolic dryness and husky roast/toasted malt giving a slight blandness and quick finish.Chewy prunes and lighter plum notes open up the flavor as sharp, but light acids dig in to the back of the palate.  A rather oily texture, with somewhat prickly carbonation does not seem to help form any softness.  And softness would seem much needed.  I get a bit of pale malt sweetness, but its quickly dissolved by a harder roastiness and strong clove-pepper phenolic dryness.  Light bananas and some fusels sit awkwardly on the finish, with a bit of piquant raisins (which unfortunately throw more astringency/oiliness out).  All in all, it seems to have the right flavors for a dubbel, but everything seems rather unrefined and disjointed.  Not too impressed with the texture/carbonation either.  Thats usually a bright spot with Bells beer.  Maybe another month or two will help even things out.  Will revisit.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Bourbon and smoky charred plums, soy sauce, dates and nuts in the nose.  A large dose of motor oil and burnt malts galore.  A bit pale and bland, not Belgian like, just a bit empty on the tongue, a bit brash and simple.  Resembles a robust or smoked porter.

On tap at the Bocktown Bar in the Robinson Township shopping complex.  Interesting label of a man being belittled and put into the dog house by a woman who is apparently his wife. Veary pleasing aroma - almost like good sugary candy of some sort.  Pours very dark, possibley black in my glass.  Nice darkish head. Very burnt roasty initial flavor like it was filtered in a barrel that was charred inside. Almost like lye soap and dont ask how I know what that taste like.

565,"2006-12-16",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 21, 2008 What a confusing beer.  Im not sure what style this is, but I am fairly confident it is not a dubbel.  Pours almost black with a garnet hue when held to the light and a head that is rich dark orange / brown.  This looks strikingly like many of their stouts.  The aroma has heavily roasted malt, some Belgium earthiness, candi sugar, hints of dark fruits and some cocoa.  Most of the flavors listed are fairly hidden behind the thick malt.  Body is slightly heavier than medium and fairly smooth with light semi-sharp carbonation.  Flavors start with lots of the roasted malt and traces of the Belgium earthiness.  It is quite dry.  There are some lightly detectable dark fruits.  The finish of the beer has more of a roasted taste that is close to tasting charred.  Further down it starts getting chalking and starts tasting like a cross between a porter and a stout than it does anything Belgium.  The body starts to lose some of its sturdiness as well.  This was a nice to try and experience, but I wouldnt want much.  It started off good and seemed to drop in enjoyment for me the whole way down. (8/3/7/3/14 - 3.5)   Rerate notes:  I guess I’m ’getting’ this more in 2008.  Aroma this year has no candi sugar notes, slight coffee and over the top roast.  Most of the notes previously are still accurate, but I feel the numbers need to be bumped up for the enjoyability and overall uniqueness.  Why this is still listed a a dubbel is baffling.  Not sure exactly what it is, but dubbel is nowhere near the top of the list.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

Um, it smells nice, but not typically dubbel-like.  Esters emerge with temp and so do the yumy dark fruits, raisin, prune, bandaid, bubblegum.  Creamy and full bodied, maybe more than expected and maybe too full, but its nice nonetheless and lastingly coating.  Its the kind of beer that causes me to make up adverbs like lastingly.

Very dark, with only a subtle tannic acid hue to keep this from being completely opaque.  A light yeasty character wafts from the glass, bringing some doughy gingerbread cookies and bubblegummy pheonlic characters as well - smooth and not spicy.  Smells like the Chimay strain to me.  A nice round of caramels and chocolate nougat blends with a hint of lightly roasted coffee, creating a fantastic malty base.  Medium bodied, silky mouthfeel.  Rich, dark malty body that brings out flavors of pumpernickel bread, unsweetened belgian cocoa, a hint of tobacco, and a smidgen of molasses.  A mellowed, yet distinctly belgian yeasty character smooths out the finish, eliminating the possibility of any dry malty edges and ending without spice in a velvety final smack.

565,"2006-12-05",4.2,"From bottle. Batch 7673. Poured dark, which was unexpected.  Nice bubbly like brown head.  Aroma of barley, malt, spice, cardamon, maple, and sugar.  Flavor sugary at the start, roasty, chocolately.  Hints of barley, nice malt backbone.  Fruity (raisens and figs), and a nutmeg tingle on the tongue.  Medium bodied. Carbonation was solid, as it tingled my tongue every so often.  Easy to drink.  Nice alcohol warming, perfect for a chilly night.

Aroma is initially toasty malt and clovey/peppery yeast, but the yeast is a minor roll.  Some bready malts;  the hint of plum fruitiness is a bit disappointing as I was expecting more, however the overall character of the aroma is quite pleasant.  Breay and toasty malt flavor in the well balanced beer, drier finish, with some dark fruity flavors (plums, hint of raisins) but they are really light!  Well balanced overall, and it takes a little bit for the dry finish to grow on you, but its nice.  Medium carbonation, Id prefer it to be higher for an abbey dubbel, medium full mouthfeel, and well hidden alcohol contribute to a smooth, velvety mouthfeel.

I agree that this is an unusual dubbel and wouldve thought stout if it werent for the huge candied sugar taste.  Nice deep black color.  Sharp hop and fusel aroma with hints of caramel.  Whoa, too much alcohol present which then gives way to an overly aggressive hop presence.  Bizarre that I taste so much fusel oils considering this isnt what I would consider a ""Big Beer"".  Later, raisens, figs and dark candi sugar make their presence known.  Decent mouthfeel, but my palate was disappointed by the lack of complexity which I so love in this style.  I enjoy the fact that they obviously experemented away from a traditional dubbel and give them points for that.  However, Id advise against drinking this young.  Perhaps a good year on this will tone down the fusel oils and aggressive hop profile.

A dense, but thin head laces a bit as it dies down.  Ahh... the first sip.  The smoke is back, and then the peat and a bit of that alcohol burn as it goes down.

The flavor is sweet and chocolatey with a slight lemony sourness and floral accents. It is very nice for a malt-accented brew, but I need more hops. It tastes like a cross between a sweet stout and a doppelbock. I would not have identified it as an abbey dubbel if not for the ratebeer.com designation, although it does have a bit of the hard-to-describe spiciness that I have come to expect in most Belgian styles, especially in the aroma. It is smooth and medium-bodied to the palate in a nice but unremarkable way. The aftertaste has a coffee bitterness that the main taste lacks. This is clearly a well made brew. It is a bit sweet for my tastes, but not in a cloying or nauseating way. Its worth a try, but it is not an every day beer. It loses a point or two in my overall score because it is a bit of a challenge to finish. I have found that the best Belgian-type beers, no matter how high in alcohol content, are eminently drinkable.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

11/18/2006:  Bells Hell Hath No Fury pours a very opaque, very dark brown color.  It pretty much looks black in the glass.  The head is large, foamy, and brown in color.  There is a scant amount of lacing.  At colder temperatures the aroma is cherry and charred wood.  I have noticed that the aroma becomes more earthy and scents of roasted fruit and some alcohol come out at warmer temperatures.  The semi-sweet flavor is a wonderful meddly of rich malt, smoke, roasted fruits, some molasses, and a weak chocolate/coffee blend.  The flavor profile is really quite deep and complex, so its difficult to explain all of the different flavors in this beer!  Some alcohol flavor is present as well, but it complements the other flavors nicely.  There is a slight dry bitterness in the long, warming finish.  Very nice!  As far as mouthfeel and palate, this beer coats the entire mouth and is medium to full bodied.  It is quite smooth and very enjoyable!  I am impressed with the depth, richness, and complexity of this beer.  Hell Hath No Fury might not be as fruity as other Dubbels, but Bells interpretation of the style is very favorable, in my opinion!  Overall, Bells Hell Hath No Fury is quite rich and complex.  At warmer temperatures the aroma is more earthy and contains roasted fruits.

8/24/2008:  This stuff is still holding on quite well!  As indicated by the think cola-brown pour, this beer has a medium-full body and low level of carbonation.  A fleeting tan head dissipates quickly.  The aroma and flavor exhibit a sweet, earthy and licorice quality.  There is also chocolate, dark caramelized candi sugar, char, as well as some dark fruits that have been cooked down, dried, and then aged!  The flavor is truly unique and difficult to describe.  This beer also has a good strength, seem balanced, and is slightly sticky on the lips.  I think it is still just as good if not better than it was when it was released in 2006...

Not to say that they dont make fine examples of the styles...Im just a bot bored with yeast, orange peel, and coriander sometimes with sweet or fruity maltiness. Although some stand out either with great balance of flavor(like Pannepot or some of the South Hampton brews) or just something different, which would be this brew here. Pours an oily dark brown with a fizzy and somewhat creamy mocha head. A good bit of yeast fills the aroma and is backed with some smoke, roasted malts, some rasin, some spice...pretty earthy. The flavor has a nice roasted malt quality...some smokiness that I think gives the usual fruity sweetness and yeast profile some breathing room to where they arent as dominate as I wouldve expected. Nice body, rich and slick with a solid amount of carbonation that doesnt go overboard and works very nicely with the roasted malt character. Tons of malt with hints of fruit ove the tounge with a almost chocolately/roasty/dry finish.

Mellows and dries out after a few moments.  Touch of lactose before the dry and richly malty aftertaste leaves the impression of velvety dark chocolate.

565,"2006-11-04",3.9,"Mmmmm, yummy! This was very dark, kind of surprised me for some reason. The colour was mostly brown, and you couldnt see through it even when up to a light source. The head was pretty large even after a controlled pour and had a nice off white head. the aroma contained spices of clove and others of unknown name. This was light but creamy feeling, filled more with flavour than body, but could never be considered thin or watery. the flavour was predominatly tasty up front malts with some spice lending a nice flavour balanced outg by a bit of a hop note, but that seems to merely balance this beer rather than add its own flavour profile. there was a bit of a lingering feeling that made me feel more like I should drink more, opposed to making me feel like I can nurse it.

Second sip was less clove & hefe-like. Big bold malt, smoke, sweet spice and even some citrus & hoppy earthiness began to creep through.   Aftertaste was a lingering hops, malt and a hint of spice.

Poured black, with brown highlights, with an average frothy mostly diminishing light brown head with a tiny ring of lacing.

Smelt of smoked game, earthy, burnt malt.

Taste was upfront moderate sweet and bitter coffee roast and earthy yeast, followed by a moderate bitter soy sauce and dark dark chocolate sweetness on a  long smokey finish.  Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied, syrupy and velvety, softly carbonated, with light astringency.

Poured dark with a light brown head, faint chocolate, dark malt and stout fragrances, roasted aroma,
the smoke fragrance was there but appeared to have weakened some, the malt and roasted fragrances have improved, there was light alcohol in the background, the alcohol did not grow as the beer warmed, this was thick on the palate, I enjoyed this more this time then last Fall.  Rating-7/4/7/4/13

----- a tan head when poured,
thick black ale, when held up to a light, no light gets through,
a hint of red in the blackness at the edges of the glass, lots of tan lacing on the glass,
aroma of semi-sweet chocolate, roasted chocolate, licorice, smoke, dark malt, faint sweet cream,
these aromas were weak, gave me the impression of a weak stout,
taste of coffee, burnt sugar, some smoke, carbonation, different then any dubbel I have tried, the sweetness comes on stronger as it warms up, like a stout recipe that used half the ingredients,
the mouth feel is medium, and the finish is a sticky dry, I may age some of the bottles to see if it improves,
something may be missing or this is not to my liking, 
I wouldnt buy this again except maybe next years batch to see if it is different,

Surprisingly impenetrable pour of dark ruby, with a rim of tan cream. Flavor is a rich warm alcohol, with vibrant plum creams and bold charred currant sauce. The dark flavor of soy and burnt lamb skin seems a little heavy for the style. But, the sweet molasses character and rising bread notes create a marvelous symphony of fruit character. Elsewhere in the profile is an epiphany of alcoholic savory robustness that speaks of refined culinary detail. Far away, some lemongrass throws aside a cast of drying balance. This grows into a berry like hop character with sweet resins leaving a delightful long smack. Another very interesting Bells beer and an absolute delight.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

565,"2006-05-16",3.4,"UPDATED: DEC 4, 2008 12 oz bottle - Almost black color with almost non-existant dark tan head. Aroma is slightly roasty, a bit smoky, roasted caramel, bit of ash, dark cherries. Flavor is slightly smokey, dry roastyness, bit of vanilla, with a balanced finish. Overall a decent brew, but not amazing. As has been said, this is not really a double, more of a belgian-style stout.  

Tap &&#35;64; cafe: Very dark brown color with almost no head. Aroma is sticky, hints of smoke, roasted caramel, dark grapes. Flavor is chewy, malty, caramel, grape, dry finish. An alright beer, but not really a dubbel. Too dark in color, no real esters in the aroma. Smokeyness is interesting, but out of place in this brew.","Salt Lake City, Utah, USA","JasonG"
565,"2006-03-02",3.9,"On tap at the brewpub.  This one pours like a thin stout... almost jet black with a thin beige head.  Smoke surrounded by dried dark fruit and bananas all wraped up in a mildly sweet finish.  No trace of the high alcohol content at all.  A fine brew.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ElBorracho"
565,"2006-02-23",3.5,"Strong roasted caramel malt and yeastiness in the aroma.  Fairly prominent caramel/toffee malt with dried fruits... figs/dates/raisins ...and a yeasty quality in the background.   Some undertones of Belgian spicing as well.   Very well hidden ABV.  Pleasantly drinkable but not a home run.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"
565,"2006-02-19",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2007 tap - This one made me think Belgian Strong Ale more than anything, but a Dubbel?  Alright.  Its dark brown with a thin head.  Flavor is of dark fruits and malt with a dry finish.  The palate is full bodied with slight yeasty bitterness in the finish.  And hey, it has a great name.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"
565,"2006-02-18",3.7,"On tap @ the Eccentric Cafe.  Poured to a dark brown/black color.  The aroma was spices and fruits.  Not really sure what the flavor was, exactly, other than very good.  Id definitely have it again.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","Hollywoodt"

565,"2005-10-09",3.5,"On tap at brewery: Deep murky brown hue with a small frothy head and good lace. The aroma has notes of earthy and fruity yeast esters, carmelized and smoky malting, and some peppery undertones, a bit weaker than I would want. The taste starts quite fruity (plum, starfruitr, and pear) with a nice dark and sweet malt base. A light smoke and subdued lactic twang greets you towards the finish. The feel is smooth and lightly oily, quite drinkable for 9% ABV. Refreshing and dry finish with a light aftertaste. A soild and enjoyable brew even if a bit muddled and not to style.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
565,"2005-10-04",3.1,"Tap @ Great taste of the Midwest- Dark murky brown color. Small light brown head. Flavor is thin, toffee, caramel, other strange things. Not really my thing personally.","Mississippi, USA","Mangino"
565,"2005-09-19",3.9,"On Tap at the Eccentric Cafe. Dark opaque brown colour with a rapidly dissapating beige head. Anise, tobacco and belgian yeast dominate the nose. Body is full , fruity and yeasty with toasty chocolate maltyness. Dangerously yummy stuff for 9%.","Peoria, Illinois, USA","Alcoholist"
565,"2005-09-11",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 21, 2006 Draft at bells 20th anniversary party. Pours a speckled brown color with a nice off white head. Nose is yeasty and bready, some light caramel and malt. Its actually quite intriguing. Taste comes through with yeast, dough and some light malt, maybe raisins and plums mixed about as well. Finishes slightly bitter and with your mouth questioning itself. 
The nose and taste both contain some cinnamon stick like qualities.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","SuIIy"
565,"2005-09-11",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 6, 2006 Pours a nearly opaque murky dark mahogany with a thin-lacing, frothy, dark tan head.  Aroma of sweet wheat and dark caramel malt with some bready Belgian yeast and light fruitiness.  Starts with a pleasant malty sweetness and good viscous, bready texture toward a drier, toasty, dark chocolate finish.  Pretty true to style and enjoyable.

On tap at the 2005 Great Taste of the Midwest:  Barely transparent, dark, cloudy brown pour with a nice, lightly-lacing, light brown head.  Has a rich, complex malty and bready Belgian yeasty aroma.  Body starts full and sweet with some mild dark fruit complexity and good Belgian yeasty character.  Nicely-balanced and complex, this beer should age very well.

565,"2005-08-14",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2006 Tap @ GTMW, and follow up goblet in December 2005 at the Eccentric Cafe.  Deep, hazy chestnut brown with nice lacing as we go.  Anise, cloves and pepper are the backdrop for a crescendo coming from chocolate and bananas.  Flavor transitions as expected, with chocolate, banana, pepper and cloves.  Creamy and well balanced.  Hints of anise on the underbelly.  On tap at the brewery, coffee nodes played a primary role with chocolate and bananas coming in as secondary flavors.  Pretty tasty stuff.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
565,"2005-08-14",3.3,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2006 Sampled at GTMW.  The appearance is a dark brown body with a tan head.  The aroma is barley and roasted malts.  A little weak.  The flavor is coffee and barley wine type flavors.  Light chocolate.

565,"2005-07-15",3.3,"Sampled on draught @ Bells Eccentric Cafe in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  Very dark brown color with a small and quickly diminishing white head.  Quite dark, considering they call it a Belgian Dubbel.  Really gentle aroma, with a light hint of molasses, chocolate and red fruit, but it is very subtle.  Upon tasting, this is more like a Belgian stout.  Really roasty, with molasses, chocolate and coffee notes and heavily yeasty, leathery tones.  Light cassis and port wine flavors as well, though very light, considering they consider this beer a Dubbel.  But, what makes this beer so special is its heavenly body.  Its so creamy and thick and really brings out the flavors.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"

565,"2005-01-02",3.7,"On tap at the Eccentric Cafe.  Deep brown (pretty much opaque) body with a thin, dissipating off-white head.  Orangey-red highlights at the edges.  Toasty aroma with residual sugars and dark fruit, light because the beer was served too cold.  Flavor was initially quite dry and toasty with plenty of chocolate, giving the beer an English Strong Ale feel, but as the beer warmed the vinous red grape finish opened up along with hints of cola, licorice, and bready yeast.  Cherry flavors also developed at warmer temperatures.  Alcohol was evident in the finish.  Another excellent beer in the tap room.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
565,"2004-12-12",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 10, 2006 draft at eccentric day 2004.  looks a lot like a doppelbock--no head, deep brown.  soy saucy, salty, spicy.  reminds me a little of samichlaus somehow. medium tingly body.bottled now, and its much the same.  dark brown/black with a tan head  and a roasted smoky aroma and flavor.  a smoked dubbel (this fits nowhere, i suppose dubbel is the closest there is) - no alcohol notes but plenty of unique earthen flavors despite a minimal hops presence.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
565,"2004-11-24",3.9,"On tap: Dark, mahogoney color.  Quite a bit of carbonation initially.  Alcohol, I thought was well concealed.  Fairly sweet, molasses-y.  Some cloves and fruit.
