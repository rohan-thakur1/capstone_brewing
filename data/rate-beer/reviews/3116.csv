3116,"2016-09-02",4.0,"On tap from Hanks Oyster Bar. Pure smoked malts with a strain of lager hops. Finish is clean.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","brownaler"
3116,"2016-08-02",3.6,"On tap at Scion in Silver Spring, MD. 

Clear, straw-yellow with a small near white head and good lacing. 

Aroma of citrus, smoked meat, grain and pale malt. 

Taste of smoke, pale malt, sweet light fruit and citrus. 

Medium body and medium carbonation with a smooth mouthfeel. 

The smoke flavor, while obvious, is far from overwhelming. Indeed, it is virtually nicely balanced by sweet malts and a touch of citrus. Definitely no ""lick the ash tray"" feeling from this rauchbier. Very nicely done.

3116,"2016-03-17",3.5,"The smoke manifests as peat, brine, minerals, smoldering fire pit, with mild trace of honey-ham meatiness. Medium bodied, semi-sweet, lightly salty / brine-y, savory malt texture with velvet fine carbonation, finishing with lip-smacking sweetness and quenching and salivating mild acidity.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3116,"2016-03-15",3.9,"Pours dark orange/copperish. Aroma: nice smoke aroma, malt, some cherry, earth. Taste: very well balanced, including a clear smoke domination but also elements of a proper pale ale, such as maltiness. Well done.","Berlin, GERMANY","dambor"
3116,"2016-02-24",3.7,"On tap at R.F.D in DC. Nice subtle smoked elements to this pale beer. Light, hazy golden pour. Malts in the nose, more smoke/ashy taste comes out in the flavor. While not a full blown rauch, this would be a great gateway to the style.","Boise, Idaho, USA","stevoj"
3116,"2016-01-30",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 31, 2016 Draft. Pale, unpromising yellow. No lace. Aroma of cherry wood, which is one of the two woods that rauched this bier. Flavors start with a tart, sweet spritz of kiwi, followed by some chewy, high register smoke and some faint sweet orange. Absolutely terrific.","","TylerGreenDC"
