1096,"2010-03-20",3.4,"From a polypin at the Bristol beer festival, 19/03/10. Slightly hazy gold in colour. Aroma of slightly sweet pear juice, with a jarring hint of paraffin.

1096,"2007-07-20",3.5,"From the barrel at Catford Beer Festival, June 2006. Hazy, peachy straw colour. Big petrol aroma, with a touch of acetone. The flavour is rather at odds with the aroma - sweet, juicy and fruity, but with plenty of tannin to provide backbone and just a fleeting impression of the ketonic elements apparent in the aroma. A delicious tasting Perry that is only undermined by the less appealing aroma.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
