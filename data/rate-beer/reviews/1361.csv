1361,"2015-01-23",3.5,"500ml bottle. Appearance: Murky, dark brown with a thick, off white foam head. 
Aroma: Toast an bread crust, with a hint of roasted malt. 
Taste: toast and bread crust dominates, with hints of chocolate and roasted malt. Seems a little roastier than other Dunkels. Hop character doesnt add any noticeable flavors, but balances the malt. 
Mouthfeel: Medium with a light to moderate bitterness. 
Finish: Crisp, with a lingering toasty flavor on the tongue. 
Overall: Great Dunkel. Maybe slightly roastier than the style indicates, but strong Munich and Vienna malt flavors dominate","","TH28"

1361,"2012-10-08",3.7,"While dunkel is not generally one of my favorite styles, this is really solid for the style.  Pours hazy brown with a light tan smallish head.  The aroma has toffee, caramel, rich toasty malt, smooth lager-ness and some hazelnut.  Medium body with a good amount of gentle, but assertive and sharp, carbonation.  The flavor starts drier than the aroma, but still has toffee, caramel and nuttiness.  Also it has a bit cereal taste and more nuttiness.  It finishes with some spiciness that probably is coming from the hops. Really well done.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
