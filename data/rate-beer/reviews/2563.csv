2563,"2015-10-11",4.2,"Location: 750 ml bottle from the brewery, 10/11/15, Blend 1 (6/19/15)


Aroma: The aroma is the pinot barrels, oak, some fruit and wheat, and a little green apple

Appearance: Slightly hazed yellowish-good with a fizzy white head and light, spotty lace

Flavor: The taste is fruity and a little grassy, tart, the red wine and oak are more subtle

Palate: This one is medium bodied, bright and drinkable with a lovely carbonation

Overall Impression: 
This is quite interesting. Its a kinda fruity and bright beer with a freshness to it thats fairly unexpected. Yet it also has an oaked / aged feel too. Theres a lot going on here, rather complex. The more I drink of it the better I think it works. Most of the time a 5 oz sample is plenty to get a feel for a beer, but this is one of those exceptions to the rule. I needed a lot more to decide that this is a really nice, complex, skillfully created brew. Really nicely done.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
2563,"2015-09-25",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 26, 2015 Bottle shared with Leighton et al. It pours hazy orange with a small white head. The nose is fresh, juicy, gin action, juniper, creaminess, floral, wood, orange peel and earth. The taste is crisp, sweet - sour, funky, minerals, orange sherbet, booze, some alcohol heat, acidity, lime zest, wood, pepper, G & T, white grape and chewy wood with a boozy finish. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Crazy stuff. Bizarre, but rather nice.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"

2563,"2015-08-18",3.9,"Draught at OEC SourFest, 8/15/15.Another golden-blonde ale, with good clarity (light haze) and a small but fairly well-retained white head.The gin botanicals come out quite prominently in the nose, but, importantly, they arent harsh nor are there any astringent, dominant wood tannins. Rather, light honey/bread-like malt notes join light vanilla and soft, floral and tart acids to yield the first gin-barrel beer I actually like. I will say, the gin sorta sits there front and center, but that seems to be the case with all of the gin-beers Ive tried so I guess thats just par for the course. But the good acidity, malt and moderate funk do enough to add complexity to the nose. No alcohol or flaw noted.The flavor is less given to the gin/botanicals. Theyre certainly there, but a proper maltiness adds a supple texture while ample carbonation helps maintain levity and the the acidity levels are enjoyable but not overdone. No grainy wood character or booziness and quite drinkable. Would love some more of this (couldnt buy a bottle of everything, sadly...)","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
