4064,"2016-12-29",3.0,"From notes. Enjoyed on draft at the Drie Fonteinen Restaurant on November 12. This one had an advertised age of 6 months. The pour is a dark orange, almost brown, with no head at all. This is syrupy and looks nothing like I was expecting for a lambic. The aroma is very sugary sweet. There is a strange bitter malt going on. There is a light Bandaid thing happening, but its just interestingly sweet. The flavor is definitely syrupy. This is sugar sweetness, a strong barrel, and just a strange flavor overall. The mouth feel is very heavy and syrupy. There is no carbonation and a lingering medicinal sweetness.

4064,"2010-09-17",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2011 Sampled at the Drie Fonteinen Cafe, 2001
This was the second straight Lambic that I had ever had, it was again far mellower than I was expecting.  Of course it was sans-carbonation (say it with a Cajun man accent its much more fun that way) and had a quite noticeable acidic aroma.  The acidity promised in the nose was surprisingly subdued in the taste.  It was much more of a balanced / mellow acidity, which I am surmising, was the result of a bit of age that helps to smooth out Lambics.  The beer itself was quite a revelation.  There was a fair amount of musty character, and an appetizing hint of mushroom and a bit of character nabbed from a proper strong stinky farmhouse cheese.  All in all it was a great aperitif for the impending gastronomic exercise that I was about to have.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

4064,"2010-05-20",4.0,"In short: A dusty lambik with a dry woody cider character.  Excellent
How: From the barrel at LambikOdroom (3 Fonteinen adjacent pub).  Graciously served free of charge by Armand himself.  
The look: Clear dark blonde body topped with almost no head
In long: According to Armand this is a 3 year old lambik, brewed march 2007.  Nose is dusty, musty, some apples.  Taste is some kind of dry cider, light funk, some leather, sour young red + green apples, wood.  Finish is quite woody dry.  A light astringent acidity but nothing like a Gueuze.  Typical oude lambic sparse carbonation.  During my second visit to Belgium I had many different draft Oude Lambics and this one was my favourite.  I still prefer assembled lambics but this beer almost made re-evaluate this statement.  Drinking this beer, served by the brewer, was a great moment but also a sad moment since I knew I was drinking from what might be the last barrel of lambic brewed by 3 Fonteinen.

What could be more removed from a malty session ale than a Lambik I thought. I wasnt disappointed - this beer is shockingly different alright. Tastes of freshly squeezed lime and lemon juice and delivered with a puckering sourness that instantly dried the inside of my mouth, trapping me in a wonderfuly vicious circle of having to take another sip to quench the thirst this beer creates.

4064,"2004-09-06",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 8, 2005 Brewed march 03, straight from the oak cask in a one litre swing top bottle. Brownish orange color, very cloudy, no head. Sedate citrus aroma, lovely honeyish citrus flavor. A fair deal of citric sourness. Cherry and just a hint of oak. A bit milky. Some walnut bitterness. Very complex lambic, especially in the flavor, with a very drinkable and refreshing character. This one is pretty good!!
Re-rate lambic from januari 04, according to Armand De Belder, who filled my litre swing top bottle with this magic stuff. Orange color, just a bit hazy. lemon, mandarin and wood in the nose. Citrus in the flavor, strong woody tones. Just a bit milky. Hint of metal. Honey and mandarin. Just a bit sour. Complex and delicious. (8 3 8 5 17 = 4.1).","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"

4064,"2004-07-07",4.7,"(sampled cask- conditioned (it was a handpump, anyway) at Akkurat, Stockholm, Sweden) Cloudy golden orange appearance with a rich frothy white head. Strong but smooth and elegant aroma of lemon, wood, soap, stable and grapefruit. Soft but very tasty and complex flavour of lemon and grapefruit. Slightly woody and sour finish but it is slightly overshadowed by the soft, juicy fruity body. Creamy mouthfeel with a flat carbonation. Very nice summerbeer. I will never forget the taste of this glorious brew.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","ante"

Medium body with relatively soft but complex palate.  Mild citrus sour start fading quickly to mellow medium bitter/sour middle and moving to a faint fragrant balsamic vinegar flavoured refreshing dry finish.

Aroma:warm rubber wheels and the normal sourness. A sour tingling feeling at the back of the tongue in an otherwise very soft beer. I had this on a very warm summer day.","Mol, BELGIUM","Kåstå"
