2554,"2017-03-14",5.0,"Alright, I am finally getting around to rating this one. I have to admit that I utterly love this beer, and I have ever since I had my first sip of it about 2 years ago. 
Pouring it in the glass it already looks great. Very similar to an imperial stout in appearance - completely black with a small mocha-coloured head. The aroma is farther removed from an impy though. While it has the same kind of complexity and intensity of the former, the Bracia is not as roasty and boasts a unique aroma due to the addition of chestnut honey. This makes it sweet but adds a twist normal honey wouldnt. The chestnut honey aroma also blends perfectly with the malt base, which is dark and chocolatey and I even smell the peat (but that may be cause I know its in there). 
Mouthfeel is rather thick and oily and rich. Flavours are intense and complex with many layers, just like the aroma. Not as sweet as the latter the chestnut honey still shines through. Other flavours include coffee and licorice, a bit of a woody and a peaty note and also chocolate notes from the dark malts. Finishes long and caramelly/toasty with a bittersweet twist. The chestnut honey flavour remains. 
What an amazing beer.","SWITZERLAND","BenL8"

 Kolor:  Czarny, nieprzejrzysty. 
 Piana:  Patrząc z góry wygląda jak potężna czapa pianki na wzorowo zaparzonym cappuccino.
Budują ją średnie i duże oczka. Ma ona ładny beżowy kolor i powolutku osuwa się w dół po krawędziach TeKu. 
Po dolaniu kolejnej porcji ponownie podnosi się do góry.
Po każdym łyku pozostaje krążek na szkle. Wzorowo! 
 Zapach:  Miazga, dosłownie miazga. Aromat jest tak słodki i tak przyjemny, że aż trudno odkleić nos od butelki.
Bardzo dużo tutaj się dzieje. Tak wyraźnej lukrecji dawno już nie czułem. 
Co niemiara tutaj kasztanów, miodu, śliwek, przypalonego karmelu i słodkiej czekolady z nadzieniem.

 Wysycenie:  Średnie. 
 Podsumowanie: 

Bracia to tradycyjne celtyckie, mocne Dark Ale wywodzące się z Epoki Żelaza.
Niewiele wiadomo o pierwotnej recepturze tego trunku. Pewne jest jednak, że było mocno alkoholowe, warzone z dodatkiem płatków zbożowych, miodu oraz kasztanów.

Fantastyczne piwo. Wiele ma wspólnego z RIS-em, ale także wieloma cechami się od niego różni.
Od samego początku fascynuje swoją dostojnością.
Sama etykieta wydaje się już bardzo królewska, szlachetna, której być może bliżej do wina, niż do piwa, ale za to już na starcie podkreśla klasę trunku.
Samo piwo jest niesamowicie zbalansowwane, wielowymiarowe.
Takie piwo, które zapamiętujesz na długi czas.
Nie sposób wymienić wszystkie jego składowe. Skupię się na zaledwie kilku, tych nietypowych.
Ogromna porcja miodu, kasztanów i cała masa lukrecji.

2554,"2015-10-27",4.1,"10%ABV. Srong Ale.

Poured out of the bottle a rich black-brown. 40ºSRM.

Nose has some very pleasant bourbon-like aromas. There is are pinot grapes in the nose. There are some nice honeyed date aromas. There is a nice sweet, wheaty slightly umami aroma, like yakitori (makes perfect sense really when you consider wheat, sugar and fire are common ingredients). Im going to take the grilled meat analogy one step further and suggest that the nose has that won There are very subtle oak and smoke flavors as well. Maybe its just my whiskey palate sneakig in here...


Mouthfeel is carbonated. Well balanced. The body on this thing is heftty and resplendent with full bodied deeply roasted sweet malts. The sweet embrace of the malts are relinquished to an almost startling bitter palate with hops, alcohol and a clean charcoal astringency. This is a beautifully calculated move to allow the palate to bloom and develop, producing nice hot coccoa, hand brewed coffee and more generic flavors of caramel, toffee and some tobacco.

Overall not a very shocking or interesting experience. 
The entire experience was predictable, but not in boring way, and more consistent with being comforting, reassuring and a feeling of being in your mothers warm embrace. A very solid rendition of a strong dark ale. Thoroughly well resourced which shows in the nose, the palate and the finish.

Completely enjoyable!

Well, I had the horrible barrel aged version of this, which was way too sweet, and like sun-tan lotion, so I decided to let this age for about a year before trying it, so that it had time to mellow. Sweet mashy aroma, a little raw and under-attentuated. Lovely dark brown, persistent tight tan head. Was just a joy to pour and look at afterwards, the viscosity and tighness of the bubbles was beautiful. Full smooth palate, sweetish. Tons of toasted coconut, pleasant sweet caramelly malts. Covers the alcohol better than it covers the Sorachi Ace. Not quite the toasted coconut of a Maui Coconut Porter, alas, its still the sun-cream aspect I dont like. As it warms it stays mellow, but doesnt become too sweet or sticky. Do like the toastiness in the finish, and also a very nice dry bitterness. Alas it goes in waves, sometimes the sorachi ace is just horrific.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

2554,"2014-05-13",4.5,"Very dark brown color with dark brown head that fads away at a moderate pace without lacing. The nose shows immense intensity of dark chocolate, tobacco leaves, roasted malt, molasses, peat, smoke, wood and dark fruit. Amazing depth. The body is not as full as I excepted with lots of tar, peat, dark chocolate, smoke, dark fruit, raisins, molasses. Modestly sweet. The honey balance out the flavors. Very intense, but for 10% the alcohol is well hidden in the mouth until you get to the finish and it has a very warming sensation that just lasts and lasts. Moderately aggressive hop bitterness in the end with lots of dark chocolate and roasted malt and a touch of honey. A true masterpiece that I would only fault for lacking the body I want, but otherwise a world class imperial stout. I need to cellar some of these.

I am rating again 30 minutes into the beer. The beer has more body as it warms, but also becomes more sweet, on the verge of too sweet. Also, I notice more port characters. I wont change my rating, but interesting to see how things change.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"

Pitch black with a mahoosive dirty tan head - utter filth in fact, this subsided after a few mintutes to leave a covering and edgework, finally ending up as the shape of a scary hedgehog.
Nose is chocolate malt, spice, herbal tang, chocolate biscuits, dark fruits on the turn.
Taste comprises bitter chocolate, earthy hopped backbone, spice, herbal, light shades of that Hungarian Zwak affair a la light creosote, bitter dark fruit rinds.
Medium bodied carbonation is a little prickly but helps this 10% number drink more easily.
So I let this one warm up over an hour or so and it didnt improve the flavours massively.

Very complex stuff - firewood, dark chocolate, powdered chocolate, sweet & sticky honey, peat, toffee. Finishes with a very caramelised/honey forward peatiness right on the back end with a touch of coconut. Works extremely well and I can see why this is so highly regarded. Very solid stuff","Perth, AUSTRALIA","maneliquor"
2554,"2013-08-13",3.9,"Bottle at mane liquor thornbridge tasting night. Pours a dark brown/black with a frothy tanned head. Nose is quite interesting. Nutmeg and bitter chocolate with dark roasty malts. Taste is much more of the same. Heaps of dark chocolate malts coming through even a touch of coconut towards the end of the palate. Fucking interesting beer Im finding it hard to describe. Would definitely recommend trying for pure complexity.

2554,"2013-01-07",4.0,"2013.01.07 - Thornbridge Bracia - 16.9oz bottle in pint glass.   I'm a fan of braggots and things made with honey so I have high hopes.  

Pours dark with a caramel head, visually looking like a stout.  Head goes quickly, little evident cabonation.  Aroma as it poured almost gave a bit of a minty fragrance.  As it warms up it moves more towards a generalized sweetness, no hops, no yeast; maybe a bit of coffee.  

First drink, roast like a stout is obvious but disappears very quickly and is replaced by sweetness.  Label mentions liquorice, might not have noticed if it didn't say so but I can definitely pick it out now.   This reminds me a bit of some of the things in the ""Black Saison"" category like New Holland Four Witches.  Mouthfeel is a bit creamy, little carbonation.   

Overall, good.  A bit expensive for any repeat purchase, but this is the only bottle I've ever seen so it may not be an option anyway.  A bit more roast/peat sort of favors than expected but definitely good and interesting.  Not as good as braggots I enjoy but definitely tasty.

2554,"2013-01-01",4.4,"Fresh bottle straight from the brewery.  Pours a dark black, with a nice foamy head which resides. Aroma is sweet honey chestnut. This beer is incredibly smooth, the 10% alcohol is well hidden and does not come out in the slightest. Very well balanced beer, having honey in it I expected it sweeter, but the slight bitter finish creates a great balance. Not a beer to drink everyday but great stuff for the holidays!","","Jimmythespoon"

2554,"2012-11-24",3.7,"Appearance:
Dark blacks under a dark espresso crema head. A thick head of crema hued foam fades into a thick collar which also swirls thick. A very alluring image of a beer.

Nose:
Berries and honey. Honey glazed and flambéed over a brilliant red-hot flame, the honey crackling and sizzling as they cooked along with the strawberries and raspberries. Sweet dark breads packed with juicy plump raisins  pumpernickel if you please. Black licorice root. Mulberries. Root beer candies.

Palate:
Interesting from start to finish. Dark fruits abound  plums, raisins, and prunes  covered in honey and berry glaze. Fresh  no artificial preservatives and additives need apply. Smokey and rooty in the back and along the edges  tendrils. Black licorice also in the back swallow. Burnt caramel. A parching finish of black cacao powder, ash, and charcoal. Delicate berries covered in chocolate greet me at the beginning of each taste. More dry dark chocolates in the middle.

Final Thoughts:
Delicious! Interestingly delicious! I had heard good things about Englands Thornbridge brewery and it would seem they were true. This is my second beer from Thornbridge and hopefully it wont be my last. Quintessentially classically English. Cheerio!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

2554,"2012-06-21",4.5,"Black and wearing a gentle beige head. Very complex and interestingly integrated nose with lots of stuff going on at once. An evident honeyed richness reminiscent of Polish mjods is first noticeable, but quickly uplifted by a roastiness that is never extreme and borders toastiness. Peated malt pairs with molasses and licorice to bring dark and leathery flavours forth. Plenty of raisins, plums and dates join the smoke in its dance, adding subtly vinous notes that are complex aplenty. It grows even more aromatic as it warms and in mouth, possesses enough tightness to evenlop and carry coherently all those flavors. A full and satisfying body punctuated by efficient, gently drying carbonation. The smoke, fruit, gentle acidity and roast all contribute to diminishing the sugary impressions and make the beer more approachable.

2554,"2012-04-19",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 28, 2013 My Bottom Line:
Pine and eucalyptus aromatics pervade this super rich strong ale, adding to a seamless mélange of molasses, peat smoke, figs, raisins, roasted malts and honey. Complex AND unique. Wow.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-Sizeable foam recedes to a slim veil atop the darkness.
-The aroma on this one is like no other strong ale Ive ever had.
-Hop resins are quite loquacious in the second half.
-The mouthfeel is dense and sticky, but not as viscous as some underattenuated Cigar City brews (for example).
-That bitter chestnut honey must be something else!
-If you served an Imperial Stout in a eucalyptus-filled sauna, it might taste like this. Then again, maybe not...
-A touch of alcohol warms each sip.

Opens a bit flat but then picks up. Chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, prunes. Only a touch of bitterness, but more from the bitter honey (?) than from the hops. It's very, very balanced in its character. Finish is super long, with a hint of coffee lingering forever. Incredibly full and rich, yet not overly imposing.

In long: Highly unusual nose that I would describe as burnt spicy wood with some cacao and a sweet pastry.  Taste is very roasted, burnt chocolate chips cookies, roasted nuts, crusty brownies, honey, peppery spiciness, burnt brown sugar, burnt tree bark, cocoa powder.  A little alcohol bite in the finish.  Aftertaste is roasted nuts, honey and cacao powder.  Overall the sweetness and high roastiness level were keeping each other in check and the beer remained quite drinkable for a 10% brew.  There was something very unusual about the entire thing that I dont think I was able to put into words, the beer was simply different.

2554,"2011-02-23",1.7,"I either have a bad batch of bottles or everyone has gone bonkers for liking this beer.  For the record I am drinking batch bottled Winter 2010.
It pours out beautifully, real dark ruby with dense creamy tan head.  The 1st sign of disaster is the nose, there is some classic caramel, oats & coffee but its overpowered by this weird gluey varnish character.  On tasting , the body is lovely & rounded, great conditioning, lovely rich nutty, chocolate & cocoa.  There is plenty of sweetness, but this is tempered nicely, but then the absolute disaster kicks in on the finish.  There is a really vile chemical varnish flavour going on where the honey has obvioulsy completely clashed, it says in the commercial description theres some peat on the finish, god knows where this peat would have come from, what would have been more honest is to say there is a vile glue flavour on the finish.

2554,"2009-05-01",4.1,"Bottle. Almost black with a huge, light brown head. Roasted and rummy aromas as well as some peat. Complex flavours, hints of honey, nuts, lots of chocolate and some coffee. Even a bit of milk. Nice full body without being too heavy, noticeable alcohol. Very complex and unique.","Oslo, NORWAY","thebeertourist"
2554,"2009-04-27",3.6,"Bottle shared by cgarvieuk, thanks man. Oddish burrito and chalk aroma, a bit of smoke. Sweetish, malty, and slightly hoppy flavor, very light carbonation. Thickish, charcoal flavor. Not sure what to make of this one. Would probably fare better with a full glass in front of me on a quiet weeknight, but one does not always have that luxury.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
2554,"2009-04-27",3.8,"Thanks to Craig for opening this!  Poured thick near-black with a well-retained cap of deep tan head.  The aroma picked up toasted caramel, honey, and nutty notes with some prickly earthy accents.. almost syrupy, but well-balanced.  The flavor found rick dark chocolate, currants, and vanilla sweetness with earth, vinous, and smoky accents around.. spicy, strong, and slightly sour finish with some residual sweetness.. tasty!  Heavier-bodied with solid carbonation and spicy warmth well through the finish.  I enjoyed this much!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
2554,"2009-04-21",4.2,"Bottle from BEERmerchants.
Purs like black molasses, head like whipped milk chocolate mousse. Rahter sweet base, malt, molasses, spcy rum. A little sourness, some raosted grain. Fantastic. Made for slow sipping.","Oslo, NORWAY","KnutAlbert"
2554,"2009-03-31",4.6,"Bottled from the brewery. Into the glass, Bracia bursts forth with molasses and creamy coffee. An initially sticky beige head came unglued into a frogspawn of stubborn bubbles above a burnished brown body. And onto the nose, in waves, came honey like no other. Not sickly sweet, not funky fresh comb, just wafts of that chestnutty tang.

A first sip revealed softer sensations, the chestnut flavoutr carried sharper on the underpeel feel of a waning oraange, all tempered by easy honey rewarming on the palate. Fifteen minutes later - yes, I can actually leave a beer this long - rewards are reaped as the crema topping is capable of being whipped up again and flavours of damp honeycomb and milky chocolate come through. Like a Crunchie dipped in cold coffee, the beer left some lovely cream on the lips with a prickle of sweetness at the end and enveloping nuttiness on the way down.

After half and hour, flavours even out to a coffe-laced sorbet with honeycomb flakes, a soft and frothy praline ebb and an assured sweetness that melts away in the mouth.

What an epic beer. There was virtuoso honey, subtleties of nuts and coffee revelling in a fantasia of flavours. It had taken me an hour to enjoy the bottle; the next one was polished off within thirty minutes but by then I knew the tune. Bracia offered a bittersweet symphony; I look forward to the same notes (albeit not neccessarily in the same order) when I try another bottle in a few months time.","Derby, Derbyshire, ENGLAND","haddonsman"

Poured an abyss like black. Nostrils were infused with a chooclate n nut aroma with traces of honey. Slipped down super smoothly. Similar things going on in the flavour department. All comes together very well indeed.","Wirral, Merseyside, ENGLAND","wyzzywyz22"

2554,"2009-02-13",4.4,"Bottle at home with mesandsim and then again cask at the rake with mesandsim, ian and chris. Alround rating: Chocolate, sweet, the nuttyness is like strange but grows to a good sweet but balancing smoothness, the honey is floral but not over powering, mocha coffee kind of hangover cure, no hops. Just a massivly great, super drinkable peice of amazing brewing.","bantervile, Bedfordshire, ENGLAND","DonMagi"
2554,"2009-02-12",4.2,"Bottle.  Pitch black beer with a very strong brown head.  The aroma is deeply coffee and roasted, and the flavour is deeply bitter, roasted coffee with a milky feel, and very dry at the finish.

2554,"2009-01-29",4.5,"Tried in bottle.  Aromas of coffee and liquorice. Pours very dark, with a beige head that last until the end of the glass. Sweetness of the honey and maltiness balance well.  Leaves a nice sticky feeling on the lips.  Overall a superbly balanced ale, infact I have to say that this has gone to the top of my dark beer list!

2554,"2009-01-25",4.2,"Bottle, at the tasting at the Rake, 17th Jan 09, with harrisoni and chriso. Like Ian, Ive got a bottle to savour at home, so expect an update to this rate. Black with a yellowy tan head. Great aroma - loads of cereal notes and that wonderful chestnut honey plus the multitude of hops. Oily yet smooth palate. The strength is fully felt too. Great stuff.","Los Angeles, California, USA","Ethereal"
2554,"2009-01-25",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2017   Bottle one of two from The University Club, Oxford, Saturday 4th March 2017, shared with Jssint,  John C, Ian, Loz and Glen. We had this and remembered  Simon (Haddonsman) cheers Simon!   This deserved a re-rate it really is a far, far better beer than I initially scored it at. As Ian mentions there is plenty of praline, but it is the wonderful bitter sweetness of the chestnut honey that rules here, it is wonderfully complex with chocolate, coffee and lots of nuts but It is also a beer to just sip and marvel at just how good it is. I love this and at £8.95 a bottle to drink in or take away excellent value.  A9 A5 F9 P4 Ov18 4.5 , I first had this some years ago a   Bottle that was very kindly passed onto me by Simon (Haddonsman) cheers mate, consumed 24-01-09   Pours shark eye black with a tan head, quite a big cushion of foam. Aroma is a little nutty and also the honey is showing as this warms in my hands. This is quite strikingly bitter on first taste, Im quite sure that I can pick out that Sorachi hop there was a little reminisence of an Oakham beer I had last year with that hop. Some dark, dark bitter cocoa, a few coffee grains and some good quality liqourice, but that honey really comes through at times. I liked this and shared it with my dad, who Im quite sure if he rated beers would have given this a full 5/5 he absolutely loved it. I really, really liked it but would like to try it again on my own. Once again many thanks to Simon for this.  A7 A4 F8 P4 OV15   3.9","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"
2554,"2009-01-21",4.8,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2013 Served from the bottle at the Thornbridge tasting at The Rake.  I have a whole bottle to myself to enjoy one evening, so this is just a foretaste of a longer rate.  Hazelnut aroma.  Velvety smooth in the mouth without being oily.  White chocolate and praline truffle flavours.  I was left pretty much speechless by this. 4.4/5.  Re-rate bottle at The Rake.  This is just better than I remember even.  The nut, the praline, the texture in the mouth all are fabulous
Cask The Rake  almost leapt over the bar when I saw that this was on cask. Black as night, thin tan head. Really does smell of chestnuts, maybe a bit of plastic. Chestnuts and impty stout in mouth, but lovely velvety smooth. It really is nutty throughout. Bit bizarre, bit oily but smooth at the same time, even a little grainy on the finish. Praline finish is amazing. Bit rawer than when I had it in a bottle. Bit more tarry. Lovely though. A couple of people didnt like it, so I finished theirs off for them too 4/5.
Re-rate.  Simons online wake.  Id kinda forgotten how good this beer was.  Ive not had anything like it.  And that praline hit, Ive never had from another beer.  Its rich magical and Im not sure Ill ever have another beer like this.  From the original batch c. 2009.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
2554,"2009-01-17",4.4,"A Mes rate. Bottle from Uto thanks to Tom. Ok, this stuff is pretty bloody impressive. Obsidian blackbird McKnight with a thick, pillowy dark tan head that is almost solid. Full on chocolate covered nut aroma, lashings of chocolate, some shoe polish and just a faint lick of booze. Equally adorable flavour. Rich, sumptuous and warming. Creamy, nutty ice cream is the best way I can describe it. Stunning cocoa notes. Faint herbs and fruit developing late. Peppery alcohol in the finish with some faint pineapple sweetness and a lingering aftertaste of bitter chocolate. Bloody awesome stuff but the best thing about it is the mouthfeel. Very thick yet slick, silky smooth and not at all cloying. Im sure the honey helps here. The honey also adds the faint musty notes that mix so well with the nuts but thankfully it is never close to the front and integrates so well. A really, really good beer. A bloody good start to the year by Thornbridge and it doesnt take a genius to predict a very very good rest of the year too. Thornbridge kick ass.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
