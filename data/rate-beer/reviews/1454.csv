1454,"2017-02-28",4.3,"Draft pour multiple times. Pours a nearly pitch black in color and topped by a small, smooth tan colored head of foam that shows good retention while settling slowly to a thin film and leaving streaks of lace around the glass. The aroma is really nice and shows a wide range of depth with notes of rich maple syrup, roasted coffee, smoky, salty bacon, bourbon, oak laden vanilla, and a touch of booze. A lot going on with this one. The flavor follows suit with the rich maple syrup, roasted coffee beans, smoky, meaty bacon, and bourbon all blended together nicely. Some oaky vanilla lends further depth while the toasted caramel and chocolate malts tie everything together. Very rich, decadent, and sweet with some balancing roasty bitterness on the back end to keep this from being cloying. Full bodied, oily slick, and very smooth on the mouthfeel with soft carbonation that leads to a lengthy sweet maple and roasty finish. An excellent imperial Porter that shows a wide range and depth of flavors. Really delicious stuff but best enjoyed in smaller doses as it starts to get very sweet as it warms up. Great beer that I really enjoyed.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

1454,"2016-12-07",4.5,"650 ml. bottled 10/25/2016 and indicating 13% abv, not 12 as currently listed. Big nose of sugar maple, dark chocolate and vanilla. Some mild notes of coffee and whiskey underneath. Im thinking I only just conjured up a hint of bacon because I wanted it to be there. Look is opaque jet black with a lasting film of tan cream. Flavors of dark chocolate, maple syrup, vanilla, whiskey and toasted barrel. Later sips develop varying touches of blackstrap molasses, char, roasted peanut and soy. Heavy body leans sweet, but never cloying. Well-cloaked 13% and a smooth low-medium carbonation makes this one dangerously drinkable. Mildly disappointed in not getting any smoke or bacon flavor, yet Id be contented to sip this all evening (or morning).","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"

Pours black , stable and thick grey head. overpowering scent of coffee, sweetness, and maple syrup. Oh my gosh what a scent ! Taste is thick, heavy, bourbon ( mild notes) maple syrup ( damn I am pretty sure I loved EVERY black beer with maple syrup so far ) heavy dark malts, sweet, very mild bitter touch. Man oh man what a beer ! The only downside is its on the rather thin side, and shile the carbonation is perfect in quantity, I think its a bit to sharp, for this style of beer ( perhaps this would be less prominent is the body was a bit thicker) . Than again, even in the category Im talking about, this is a very subtile negativity , and to bitch about something as little, in a great beer like this, well, is just pointless. Just drink it, enjoy it, and share it only with the ones you really love, cause you will regret not having drank the rest if you dont :)","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"

The aroma comes off a touch too sweet as the maple syrup dominates. After the first sip its instantly apparent this beer is to thin to hold up completely well. Its also almost too roasty. Its a beer of extremes, too sweet, yet too roasty, and too thin. The finish provides a very nice touch of vanilla that saves it. I warm up to this as I go, and its very drinkable.

1454,"2015-12-30",4.7,"Pours a black color, with a dark brown, thick, bubbly head. Its head doesnt collapse at all, while revealing more and more huge bubbles among its pitch black surface after giving the glass a swirl.

Has fantastic aromas to it, offering lots of slightly smoked, chocolate infused malts, among caramel and melting toffee. Atop of this foundation settle fresh cold pressed coffee beans, blending perfectly into the already established sweetness. Maple syrup provides a soothing quality, tying the flavors outstandingly well together, balanced by a wooden vanilla oakiness. 

Drinks very smooth throughout, while featuring a spicy warmth during its finish, exhibiting the beers huge body in a perfect fashion. The tongue gets coated by mocha and bakers chocolate for minutes, showcasing a thick, rich softness on the tongue.

Creates its taste foundation by bringing maple syrup coated, fresh crushed coffee beans, toffee and roasty malts to the palate. This creates a great interplay between uprising milk chocolate, whipped cream, espresso and cinnamon coated wood bark. Once established, the flavors mainly evolve due to the genuine integrated Bourbon barrel, adding vanilla, coconut bark, mellowed by the syrup. Coffee bitterness maintains enough character to cut through, soothed by whipped cream, becoming even richer, when a subtle smokiness arises from the malts, effectivly blending into the barrels spiciness. Finishes with milk chocolate, softening the beers warmer Bourbon bite, featuring an enjoyable espresso bean bitterness during the aftertaste, remaining on the palate for a while.

Fantastic beer, with an intense, far reaching flavor profile, slowly adding complexity till the very end, resulting in a complex, very smooth stout. All the different adjuncts get integrated outstandingly great, entangled into the beers luscious milk chocolate, whipped cream foundation.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1454,"2015-12-18",4.2,"22 oz. bottle shared by some guy Id never met at a tasting that sort of formed around me as I was sitting in the back of Ei8ht Balls tasting room. The bottle was wet when I got it, so I poured myself a pinch (Danish style), and as I passed it to the next guy it slipped out of my hand, tilted sideways, and didnt spill. But it knocked over a guys almost-empty taster, with the beer going on to the table. The weird guy who shared it jumped out of his seat as if Id dropped a week-old infant and made a huge scene as he used his hand to mop the maybe less than one ounce of this into his glass (a big snifter - he gave himself the lions share) while chastising me and while refusing to make eye contact as I stood there, alarmed and apologetic, grabbing a rag that I wound up not needing because of his antics. I sat down at the table and grumbled something like, ""Have some decency, man"" as he went back to his table and the guys around me just kind of mumbled- although I couldnt tell if they thought I was the asshole or if he was. Regardless, I left after finishing this because I have a decreasing tolerance for grown-ass beer nerd men who cant handle themselves in a social setting. And Im going to get a fucking rate off of this because I deserve it. It pours a near-black opaque coffee brown with a moderate dark tan head that settles into a ring. Its exactly what I thought it would be - big coffee, big maple, big charred oak, big caramel and vanilla, big toasted brown sugar, and enough of a smokiness to add that bacon aspect. Medium-full bodied, with a sweet, sticky mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Sorry for spilling a half ounce of your beer, dickhead.

1454,"2015-09-24",4.8,"From notes. Enjoyed on September 19 at Travis house. Tommy brought this gem, and I will thank him incredulously. This poured from a 22 oz bottle the way a heavy stout would. It was used motor oil gulping out of the bottle. There was a dark tan finger of head that slowly dissipated to a small film. The aromas. Holy hell. There is an amazing maple dominance. There were hints of chocolate, light roast, and a barely-there coffee presence. No bacon or smoke on this one. The bourbon is a little present on the end, but thats what you want. The flavor is great. Again, the maple is the heavy hitter covering up a nice coffee in there. Chocolate, vanilla notes, and light bourbon are afterthoughts. The maple is sweet and sticky and the coffee is the only other pickable flavor. The mouth feel is light. Its soft carbonation makes it nice and creamy, but it is pretty light. The aftertaste is lingeringly maple heavy with a light coffee dragging out the finish. This thing is what Id imagine Mornin Delight Light would be.

1454,"2015-06-23",4.6,"On-tap at the Funky Buddhas 2nd Anniversary Party. Served in a Funky Buddha snifter. Like Wide Awake, its black without being inky. Some wisps of khaki bubbles. Slightly sticky. Like Wide Awake, it has a great coffee aroma blended with the smoked malts, but the barrel mellows both. Bourbon with just the slightest hint of earthiness and oak. Subtle barrel character. Barrel character is subtle in the taste, too. Its definitely not overpowering with the bourbon. Its there, but it blends with the coffee and mutes the acidity. It amplifies the earthy character of the coffee and amplifies the maple. The smoke acts as a counterpart to the sweetness and reminds me just a little bit of CBS. Its phenomenal. Drinks really easily for an imperial stout. Heavy, but drinkable. Really wanted to get a second pour of it, but it was long gone.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

1454,"2015-06-04",4.2,"On tap at Churchville, great beers but the worst ran event I have experienced in 8-9 years. Pours black color with notes of espresso, marshmallow, hazelnut, maple syrup, cold pressed coffee, and light sugars. Deadly for the percent. Not much bacon or smoke which is fine by me but surprising since wide awake and maple bacon had the meat/rauch quality. Rich java bean smell and flavor as it continued to warm, Medium stickiness. Awesome stuff but my third favorite of the day behind French toast, and diamonds and virgins from TH.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
1454,"2015-06-04",4.7,"Draft. Black pour with tan head. Sweet maple, candy, bourbon, french toast like aromas. Sweet malty tones, French toast, maple, chocolate sweet flavors.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"

Reviewed from notes at NotB this past weekend [Feb 2012]. Was fortunate enough to enjoy ~2.5 pours of this gem before it kicked.

Extremely viscous and pitch-black body. Mounds of dark brown head stew on the surface, clutching the sides of my tasting cup for dear life. Hard to believe this isnt nitro.

Freshly roasted coffee erupts from the foam, turning heads across the room. Roasty malts and caramel sugar join the fray. Reminds me of a fresh mocha espresso drink from my favorite coffee shop. Easily one of the best aromas Ive ever smelled from *any* beverage, let alone a beer.

Taste is nothing short of revolutionary. Everything from the nose is here in full force with unbelievable depth of flavor and complexity at every corner. Whiskey barrels impart just the right amount of flavor; many brewers these days go nuts and over-emphasize the barrel character, but this was just right.

Huge, creamy body carries the torrent of flavors home flawlessly. Morning Wood is on the sweeter side of the spectrum, but still balances exceptionally well. The litmus test for this is my brother (who despises sweetness in beer, stouts in particular), and his illuminated face confirmed my suspicion that this was his new favorite beer.

Its easy to get caught up in the fury of this magical nectar while youre drinking it and make superlative claims left and right, which is why I decided to wait until after the weekend to collect my thoughts. That said, I can confidently say this is the best beer Ive ever had. Morning Wood is simply on another level from every other stout.

How Funky Buddha managed to outclass every single other brewer at NotB & EBF is a mystery, but that isnt important; I just need more of this beer!","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"
1454,"2012-10-05",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 27, 2016 Tap at Funky Buddhas 2nd year anniversary. Black coffee color. Nose is coffee, maple syrup, smoke, whiskey, peanuts, perspiration, wood. Taste is coffee, maple syrup, whiskey, peanuts, and chocolate. Very smooth, great mouthfeel. Cleans up some of the roughness in Wide Awake. 

Bottle: black pour, tan head. Nose is huge maple syrup, some smoke. Taste is very sweet maple syrup. Not much whiskey, no coffee. Ash and smoke on the finish. Dry mouthfeel. The loung version I had a few years ago was much better, although the nose was still incredible.","","knickskicks"
1454,"2012-09-30",4.6,"Draft at the Buddhas 2nd Anniversary Party - Pours black with little head and carbonation, Smells of bourbon, oak, a little vanilla, coffee, and slight smoke, Taste like I poured a maple syrup aged in bourbon barrels over my pancakes and bacon, plus some bourbon in my coffee, All of the flavors are perfectly balanced. Its not overly bourboned and at over 11%, no boozy taste and smell. This is a top notch beer!!!","Port St. Lucie, Florida, USA","biggsbowler"
1454,"2012-03-05",4.7,"4 samples at NOtB - by far the best beer at the fest, and the first to kick. Dark brown with a velvet brown head. You get huge smooth coffee, subtle bacon, vanilla, oak that massages the rest of the flavours; velvet and smooth on the palate, moderate carbonation and full body, a great balance of sweet without overwhelming. I havent had the base beer so cant comment on how it compares but I the BA seems to impart an extra dimension without overwhelming and to be honest it was probably one of the best beers I have had...period. If you can try this, or any variation do so.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"
1454,"2012-02-15",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 1, 2012 Draft This beer rocks! Pours black with a small, creamy, beige head. The bouquet delivers huge Cuban-roast coffee with a mild smoked bacon component and a hint of maple syrup. Full-bodied, thick and chewy with modest carbonation. The flavor offers big-time mocha, heavy espresso and light smoke. Sweet, but not overly so. Finishes like a double café con leche. The bacon and maple components are lessened by the time spent chillin on bourbon-soaked oak, but its still WIDE AWAKE, so the base beer and coffee component remain beyond-amazing. World class brew!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1454,"2012-02-08",4.3,"NotB, EBF 2012. Got a reasonable pour, 3+ ounces from a pitcher. Body was pitch black with a creamy tan head. The nose is fresh ground organic grade A sumatra espresso. Its amazing how bright and clear the coffee came through in the nose. Mouthfeel was creamy and silky with a good amount of weight, but did not turn sluggy in my small tasting.  Flavors were of bright fresh coffee, bitter dark chocolate, mellow complementary oak notes (not sure if its oak or what wood) and some agave/maple syrup/vanilla sweetness that evens out any of the bitter coffee notes.","Hyde Park, Massachusetts, USA","ElDuderino"
1454,"2012-02-05",5.0,"On tap for Night of the Barrels. Traveled all the way from FL to show the Buddha support and to try this beer. Well the Buddha didnt disappoint in the slightest. Easily the best non sour beer at NOTB. The coffee, maple, whiskey barrel character was all there and very well balanced. Way to kill em Buddha!!!",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"
