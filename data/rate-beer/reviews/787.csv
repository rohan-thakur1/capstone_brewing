787,"2012-04-28",3.4,"Bottle by 08.06.12.  Pleasant nose with good phenol/ester balance and a little chocolaty malt.  Dark red body looks murky brown, creamy/rocky tan head.  Thin and watery, restrained sweetness with low bitterness, clove/bubblegum picking up to outpace banana, which is effectively buried.  Really heavy orange rind, and quite acidic for a DW.  I tend to murder this style but theres nothing to go after here!","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

787,"2007-07-09",3.3,"(bottle) Cloudy, chestnut colour with a big but non-persistent foamy off-white head. Yeasty, slightly sweet, moderately wheaty nose with light toasted and fruity notes (citrus, prunes), also light clovy phenols and a touch of cacao. Light sweet flavour with a whiff of acidity, light to medium bodied with a lively carbonated mouthfeel. Slightly toasted, restrained fruity taste with moderate wheat-character and a touch of vanilla; slightly sweet and sour, wheaty finish with rounded phenolic spice (cloves, Muscat). Solid Dunkelweizen.","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"
787,"2006-05-10",3.2,"Bottled. Pours a dark brown with ample head.  The aroma is of caramel and malt.  This is a medium bodied beer that is so smooth and has a taste of caramel and a slight hint of banana.  The flavor disappears on the tongue quickly and has little or no after-taste.  I also got mine from Hi-Time wine in Costa Mesa!","USA","warriorx99"
787,"2006-04-10",3.7,"Dark, dark chestnut in color with a light beige head that dimishes into a ring too quickly, this tasty brew has a sweet caramel aroma accented by banana and a huge wad of bubblegum.  Soft mouthfeel.  A Wheaties taste comes forward in the flavor, but its dominated by the sweet caramel and bubblegum from the nose.  The finish is a bit rusty, but the banana and bubblegum fill the mouth at the very end.  Very nice.  We need this distributed in Chicago.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp? Wine Cellars, Costa Mesa CA<font size=-1>","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
787,"2005-09-17",3.6,"(500 ml bottle: $2.09 at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA) Yet another very attractive Dunkelweizen, it seems they all are.  This one pours a medium ruddy brown that is fully cloudy, and theres just an amazing display as I watch the carbonation bubbles form on the side of the glass, then releasing, beginning their quick ascent up through the liquid in great numbers.  The tan head pours to over an inch in height, and thanks in part to the army of carbonation bubbles, very slowly recedes to a thin, but full layer.  The nose is sweet, caramel, dark malts, banana and some wheat.  Lots of sweet caramel maltiness, banana, bubble gum, and wheat in the flavor.  Plenty of malt in this beer to give it solid medium ""plus"" body, though it does seem to thin out a bit in the finish.  Despite the massive assault by the carbonation bubbles, the mouthfeel is only lightly carbonated and very soft and smooth.  Overall, a very nice beer, though perhaps just a touch too sweet, or lacking a lightly tart contrast in the finish.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
787,"2005-07-21",3.6,"Spicy banana dominate this one, not overly sweet, I like that. A pretty good Dunkelweizen, good on this hot California day,full bodied, but still good on a hot day, I will try more dunkelweizens when its hot like today!","Saarlouis, GERMANY","Saarlander"
787,"2005-01-12",3.9,"Head is initially large, frothy, off-white, fully lasting. Body is hazy dark amber, bottle conditioned. Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, toasted grain/bread), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with notes of orange, banana, and clove. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation.  The best of the three Will-Brau weissbiers.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
