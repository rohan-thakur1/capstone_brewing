Aroma is a violent clash between toasted malt, and grassy floral hops, and a yeasty spiciness. Taste is mildly hoppy, resinous grassy floral and noble hop notes tempered with a pleasant coffee, chocolate, burnt sugar sweetness of the toasted malt which is the dominant player - roast forwar. Scotch whisky barrel smooths out some of the alcohol but removes the sharpness of the bitterness, aging process has the floral hop nose diminished.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","bulldogops"

Oh yeah - that is some serious shit right there. Run, dont walk, yadda yadda yadda. To Øl Sort Mælk RIS blended with Brewdog Hardcore DIPA: you get the full creamy character of an RIS, combined with the floral hops of a DIPA - whats not to like? (And, this might be an example of weaknesses cancelling out - in particular, Ive found the Brewdog Hardcore to be a bit too malt forward for my preference, but in this collab/blend, that somewhat minor sin gets washed out by the heavy sweetness of the RIS anyway, so it doesnt really count for much.) Yes, its a bit of a kitchen sink of flavours, and its not something youre likely to session - at least, not for very long - but it is something youre gonna want to try. Given the fact that this is actually a blend, Im not completely sure this is really a true ""Black IPA,"" but if it is, its probably one of my favourites of the style. (17/20)","CANADA","UXO"

The nose shows a lot of the scotch and wood with small hints of peat. The wood adds a slight brightness (most likely vanilla). 

The palate shows high carbonation. The first impression shows a slight sweetness and a very nice brightness from the vanilla. These flavors in combination with the milk sugar makes it taste like a vanilla chocolate shake. The carbonation and consistency are enough to remind one it is an ale though. The bitterness mostly comes from the hops but it is barely noticeable. The scotch is shown prominently in the background throughout the beer and gives it an extra dimension.

BBE 03/12/15 - Pours pitch black with a smooth brown head. Aroma of fruits, roasty malts, lactic notes, licorice, coffee, oak, wood and hints of berries. Taste is smooth, hoppy and roasty with notes of coffee with milk, licorice, hints of oak, vanilla, wood and ash. Finish is roasty, bitter and sweetish with some milky coffee notes, licorice, oak, whisky and fruity hops. Quite untypical, but works surprisingly well. Each sip tastes like a different beer.

3963,"2015-01-07",4.2,"Hoppy nose (citrus, pineapple, grass) with some underlying dark roasted malts. Extremely smooth over the tongue this beer is a mish mash of flavours (as I guess you'd expect), however it works rather well with the light fruity start giving way to a long bitter finish of coffee & hops. An exceptional beer made all the better by its experimental nature.

I have sunk more Hardcores than any other IIPA - Also a firm favourite. With the Hardcore Maelk, Im a wee bit conflicted. Its tasty but I have to say its worth less than the sum of its parts. Tastes great like it was brewed by a world class brewer but Id rather you served me two halves of the base beers than one whole of this.","CZECH REPUBLIC","TheCametron"
