1063,"2005-09-16",4.0,"Top perry of the festival for me - Spicy, intensely fruity bouquet invites you in for a sip.  Hazy yellow golden coloured body.  Fairly sweet flavour is bursting with fresh pears with a lightly sour barnyard undercurrent.  Fairly straight-forward bu very enjoyable.  Medium body is a bit sticky with mild alcohol warming.  Barrel (6.5%) sampled at GBBF 2005.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
1063,"2005-09-06",3.5,"6.5% according to my notes, but cider and perry does tend to vary from batch to batch. Pale straw colour, with a slight haze and a characteristic perry peachy tinge. This is a pretty decent perry that manages to combine intense fruit and a reasonable amount of traditional character (although perry doesnt tend to develop the depth of barnyard aroma that cider can).  Clean and fresh. Nice, but not the most demanding.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
1063,"2005-08-04",2.6,"Gravity @ Derby BF. Big on pears to the point of overload; found the aroma to be harsh. Harsh tasting too, very dry, flavours seem to fly by.","Derby, Derbyshire, ENGLAND","haddonsman"
1063,"2005-07-11",3.7,"Cask conditioned - gravity - Derby BF.  A reasonably clear greenish streaw coloured perry.  The aroma is full of pears and pear skins and is noticeable from a fair distance.   It is quenching, farmyardy and inviting.  The taste is snappy and full of pears.  It is on the dry side.  Clean and juicy with a medium body.  Tasty, moreish and spanking!","Wootton, Northampton, Northamptonshire, ENGLAND","maeib"
