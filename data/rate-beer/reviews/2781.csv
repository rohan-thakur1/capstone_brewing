2781,"2014-01-07",4.0,"Tapped at the brewpub. Adjusted recipe. This semi dark lager is fantastic! The smell of minor rostaed malt, malt and hops reminds me of a standard lager by Zamocky brewery. However, some good notes of sliced wild apples. The aroma is great, no doubt! 
The taste is a blend of malt, roasted malt and hops and overall very well balanced with some really minor notes of warming alcohol and pleasant hops and some roasted malt in the end. Maybe a bit sweet in the aftertaste, but nothing disturbing.
Overall a very good semi dark lager, probably the best I have drunk in the region of Slovakia and the Czech Republic in the past 2 years.","SLOVAK REPUBLIC","Karol"

Yeasy tones and modest hops. Taste has a strong caramel-sweetnes with notes of brown sugar and molasses. A refreshing fruity acidity underneath. Mild bitter endnotes. Drinks good, a tad too sweet to stand out. [12.04.13]","Oslo, NORWAY","OleR"
