3344,"2017-05-07",3.7,"Bottle. Light bronze, orange hue with frothy, well retained head. Muted tropical fruit aromas with malt backing. Strong grapefruit flavours, with tropical and stone fruits. Quite bitter and only malt hints towards the finish. Without the malt it lacks a little bit of balance, but has plenty of flavour with no hollow points synonymous with session IPA.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","M_Sack"
3344,"2017-04-29",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 29, 2017 This is a real teeat. Deep hazy orange colour. Very plesant sweet citris pineapple fruity and slightly pungent aroma. Extensive lacing on the glass. Upfront malty flavours with hoppy bitterness too. Sweet fruit flavours. Creamy mouthfeel. Medium body. Super easy drinking. A delight.","AUSTRALIA","danjs5"

3344,"2017-01-19",4.0,"On tap at Aether Brewing. Burnt yellow appearance with white head and fruity hop nose. Smooth bitterness from start to finish. Solid malt backing for a session beer.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","ANZUShophunter"
3344,"2016-12-08",3.8,"Bottle from Craftissimo. Drank w Matt at home. Pours a cloudy bright orange-tan with white creamy foamy head. Smells of juicy piny hop, loads of citrus, lime leaves, toasty malt, bit of bubblegum and tangerine sorbet, smooth faint floral/vanilla. Taste is moderate to heavy piny hop, quite dry, slightly peppery light toasty malt. Body is creamy, moderately bitter, very lightly chewy/frothy at the finish. Very good. Possibly the best session IPA Ive tried. Great aroma.","HONG KONG","CacheManyHose"
3344,"2016-12-08",3.8,"Bottle from Craftissimo at home. Hazy orange yellow pour with thin white head. Really nice fruity orange aroma with a bit of zest. Delicious. Taste is orangey and pretty bitter, has a bit of the session IPA empty taste. Nice. Light palate. Really good for a light IPA.","HONG KONG","HKdIPA"
3344,"2016-10-12",3.2,"Bottle, bb 4/18 (!). 10C. Pale orangish amber with a white head that settles to a cm. Aroma of mango, passionfruit, pepper, crackers, some caramel. Light bodied, moderate carbonation. Some crackers but really all about the hops - enough though I guess that its neither empty nor harsh for the first couple of swigs. Surprisingly as much spicy as fruity: the tropical fruit come early, the spices arrive at the dry and fairly bitter end. The bottle says only 25IBU but it is edging up on too bitter for its body for me.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
3344,"2016-09-20",4.4,"Pours a nice golden colour with a small tight head. Aroma on the nose is full of tropical fruits. pallet is the typical pacific hop build with a lot of stone fruit character. good length and the typical IPA bitterness that is shorter than normal, but as it says, its a session IPA","AUSTRALIA","beerdevine"
3344,"2016-09-20",4.2,"Followed the Stone Go to with this. A lot bigger in profile, lots of tropical notes o the nose. Bitterness solid and the stone fruit flavours flow through to the taste. Finishes like an IPA should.","ITALY","Gio72"
3344,"2016-09-19",4.1,"Not a bad session IPA. the market seems to be flooded with them and find half to be more Pale Ales than IPAs. Nomad has delivered a beer with a nice hop profile obviously using a tropical blend like Galaxy and VIC Secret. Pours a lovely amber, nice full mouth of hops and stone fruit, finishes bitter just like an IPA should, but the length is short so the session ability is perfect.","NEW ZEALAND","Keza61"
3344,"2016-09-19",4.2,"No. 6 in the tasting session and was a welcome break from the Big ABV beers. Lovely tropical fruit aroma on the nose and a nice clean mouth delivering the traditional IPA punch. Good length and great session ABV","AUSTRALIA","lharts"
3344,"2016-09-19",4.5,"You can taste the Aussie hop blend in this baby. Its got a big nose and pallet and drinks like a full strength IPA, finishing with that bitterness you know you want when you have a proper IPA. Finishes leaving a slight bitter finish with good length, but not too long so you cant keep going for more.","AUSTRALIA","Peterhops"
3344,"2016-09-18",4.8,"A real IPA! Ive had both batches and the 2nd batch is much more balanced and delivers a great IPA tasting experience, without the big ABV.","AUSTRALIA","jlatta7"
3344,"2016-09-18",4.8,"Finally a session IPA that tastes like a real IPA and not a watered down pale ale.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","thewalker"
3344,"2016-09-10",3.5,"Bottle from Greenslopes Cellars 080916. Its all in the name with this beer - an easy to drink session IPA that hits the spot and has just enough hoppiness to keep you interested.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"
3344,"2016-06-18",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 23, 2016 Taster at Brothers Beer. Clean and hoppy with tropical notes. Smells absolutely divine.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","explosivedog"
3344,"2016-05-21",3.4,"On tap at Nomad, pours a hazy copper golden with a medium beige head. Aroma brings out crisp crackery malt and some dry hopping. Flavour is unusual for a session IPA, with lots of citrus hops, quite pronounced dry hopping, and crisp crackery malt. Quite a strong astringency on the finish. Works well for what it is. Nice one.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
