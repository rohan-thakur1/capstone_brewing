Pours thick and completely cloudy. Light yellowish tinge to it. Pretty sure this didnt come from a horse breeding facility, but it looks like it might have. Aroma of white rice, glue, fruit, coconut. Taste is smooth coconut and rice, light glue notes. Not my favorite nigori, but ok.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","hershiser2"

886,"2012-03-11",4.4,"A very good Nigori with a bit of a sharp edge to it, not from the alcohol, but from the citris flavors.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","bpreo"

The palate is sweet and well hidden alcohol.  Very delicate and clean finish.  I though this was amazing stuff.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
886,"2011-02-11",3.5,"Pours a chalky white color. Sweet yet dry mouthfeel. Notes of licorice, honey dew, pepper, and alcohol. Bold flavors. Kind of like it.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
886,"2010-04-27",3.6,"Glass at Kabuki - Wakefield, RI. This was impeccably cloudy and coconut flesh white, with a sheen of pearl. Aroma glowed in coconut cream, asian pear, and lychee. Soft and supply. The palate was creamy and dense, but not heavy or too sugary. Balanced and enjoyable, but not deep. I thought for the price and presentation, it was a nice example. The alcohols edge a nip fuseled, but compared to lower grade rocket fuel, this stuff comes across as awful refined.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
886,"2010-03-12",2.8,"The aroma is light for a 16% with both coconut and rice. The appearance is cloudy white and still. The taste is sweet and like the aroma. The palate is both oily and chalky. The sake is solid but pretty standard for the style.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
886,"2010-03-12",3.0,"very fruity all the way, slightly oily on the palate along with grass ans some floral characteristics. heavy on the rice and coconut flavor.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
886,"2010-01-06",3.2,"750ml bottle.  Pours a cloudy, grayish ivory color with tiny striations of slightly lighter particulate.  The viscosity appears standard for a nigori.  Aromas include banana pudding, cream, coconut water, and light koji.  Flavors are similar, showing tapioca and banana, lactic cream, lychee, and koji.  The palate is initially creamy, moving towards somewhat grainy, sweet, and warm.  Overall, its a decent nigori, though thats no major accomplishment.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
886,"2009-06-16",3.5,"Bottle: Pours a lychee colored off-white with a hint of beige. Not very sticky for a nigori and Im not seeing a lot of particles. The nose is bright and minerally with a pronounced fruitiness for a nigori. Lots of banana and kiwi. The flavor is mellow; light impact and (for a nigori) and lightly creamy mouthfeel that doesnt try to choke you with rice. Very light alcohol notes and a lower acidity that I like. Similar to the other organic from Momokawa, this one has a little grace different than their other sakes. A little more rounded and quaffable. Im no nigori fan but this one put a smile on my face.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
886,"2008-10-07",3.2,"Pour is white will subtle hints of yellow...smell is sweet with coconut, almonds, and peanuts...taste is very sweet with lots of coconut flavor...lots...a creamy texture for sure, but a lot grittier than other Nigoris....","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"
