2166,"2016-10-01",3.5,"Really unique. Pours golden yellow, low head. Nose is some farmhouse funk, banana, a little juniper. Taste is a blend of saison breadiness, rye spice, and some pine too. Finishes slightly bitter and spicy.

2166,"2016-09-26",4.0,"Draught sample at the brewpub, September 23rd. Fully lasting creamy white head tops a translucent amber body...nose of smoked corn at first, faint molassess sweetness...carroway-rye develops with a few minutes nosing; if theres juniper here, I cant really tell, but its a nice light welcoming nose in any case...body is dry and light-textured throughout, rye bread soaking up faint wisps of honey and spice, with the finish a bit smoky, burnt, tart...velvety-soft, I might even say cushiony or feather-soft mouthfeel, with strong effervescent carbonation. Hugely drinkable and, as the description says, ""refreshing"". Ive only had a few sahtis, and none for several years; this may well be a stylistic outlier and be totally ""wrong"" for all I know - but I have to be a ratings outlier here and say I just loved this, true and correct or not. Easily the best thing I had at Vintage that day (though not the best Vintage beer I had that day, strangely enough).","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
2166,"2016-08-12",3.2,"Hazy yellow pour at the brewery. Slightly herbal and malty nose. Sweet, herbal, interesting bitterness in the finish.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
2166,"2016-08-12",3.0,"Sampled from the tap at the brewpub. Pours a near clear mellow gold with a white head that lasts throughout the beer. Aroma has earthy grain, straw and bitter juniper backing. Flavor has earthy juniper supported by sweet grains and hay.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
2166,"2016-08-12",2.9,"Keg @ Vintage. Hazy old with a small head. Nose has mellow smoke. Homeyed berry. Toasted wood. Flavor is mildly smoky. Berry skin. A touch cloying on the finish. Light body, pillowy.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
2166,"2016-06-27",3.2,"Draft. Light apple, banana, caramel malt and juniper aroma. Cloudy amber with small head. Lightly sweet apple/orange, caramel malt, and mildly bitter juniper flavor. Good body. Good juniper presence but not much fruitiness.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
2166,"2012-04-11",3.3,"Draft at Vintage.  Hazy, dull browned amber.  Thin head.  Non-descript mellow aroma.  I havent had too many Sahtis, but this comes off more like brown ale met sahti.  Kind of odd, the juniper attempts to even it out, but doesnt quite make it.  Medium bodied, nut brown.  Interesting and relatively well executed, comes off a little homebrewish.  OK, nothing to seek out.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
2166,"2011-10-19",3.5,"On tap at Vintage brewpub.  Clear amber with a thin off-white head.  Aroma of juniper, spices, rye and malt.  Taste is herbal and spicy with light rye, caramel and nuts.  Havent had the style much, but this one seems decent.","Oak Creek, Wisconsin, USA","esjaygee"
2166,"2011-09-05",3.2,"Tap at the brewpub. Clear light amber pour with a thin white head. Rye and grain on the nose. Medium palate. Taste was juniper, rye, and a touch of gin.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
2166,"2011-08-23",3.4,"On draught at the Vintage brewpub in Western Madison, Wisconsin. Pours a clear copper amber colored brew with a thick and creamy off white head the slowly dissipates and leaves behind some spotty lacing. Aroma of multi-grain malt, piney juniper berries, and a hint of toffee. Taste is medium bodied, multi-directional with flavors of multi-grain malt, a touch more rye noted in flavor than aroma, some iced tea and juniper berries. Finish is smooth, some sweet malt aftertaste with plenty of juniper berries, than a crisp semi-dry bitter aftertaste.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
2166,"2011-08-14",2.9,"Draft on tap the brewpub (Madison, WI). Pours a crisp amber hue, good glow with some copper life, touches of haze and an inviting frothy offwhite head atop, dies to a thicker ring. Aromas are sweeter malts, crisp biscuits and toffee, bread, and toast with a faint spice and light lingering Juniper qualities. A bit dull. Initial is sweeter up front, sweeter toffee, biscuits, toast, some sticky sweet malts with growing touches of dry pine, juniper berries. A bit dry in the finish, but the sweet malts cut through pretty well. Some touches of dough, sweeter malts, a touch of cake. The backend offers that dry Juniper, but not strong enough for me leaving this as a sweeter offering. Ok, interesting, but not my favorite. I do get a touch of lingering Juniper and dry florals, with some tinges of gin. But a bit weird.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Ordering a flight of several inviting beers I know that I will be back here for the pre-GTMW gala. The caliber of beers that have been coming out every time I visit just blow my mind. The quality of this sahti was among the best I have had. Slightly tart with a rusty bite the result is excellent.

Aroma / Appearance - The cloudy body was the color of watery maple syrup. Rusty figs, sour juniper, and a tartness like cranberry juice give it a bright aspect which feels almost rustic.

Flavor / Palate - Rye, juniper, and a light sourness bite at the back of the throat. Cooling like a homemade iced tea the beer lights up the senses. Like a natural soda it doesnt have any artificial or forced feel. A refreshing summer beer this is a great way to start a flight.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
2166,"2011-08-04",3.1,"On tap at the brewpub - Wasnt a big fan of last years sahti, and this wasnt really my thing, but it seemed put together better and I could actually see it growing on me. It pours with very little head on top a reddish-brown pour. Smell is light juniper, dusty yeast, and light malt. Not very pungent. Taste is a bit tart, with the spicy juniper and a little sweet maltiness taking center stage. Theres a bit of gin in the finish, which comes in rather abruptly, but thankfully isnt very hot. Interesting. Sharp carbonation detracts, but I would say overall this is intriguing and if I drank enough of these I might acquire the taste.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
2166,"2011-07-20",3.5,"On tap at Vintage 7/20/11, only been on tap for a few days so far, pours a clear dark orange with a thin head, aroma is full of rye with a hint of fruit on the nose, the flavor has a nice backing of rye with a finish of pine from the juniper berries, it has a nice dry finish with a little bit of tartness, interesting brew, I enjoyed this one.","Quad Cities, Illinois, USA","cbfobes"
