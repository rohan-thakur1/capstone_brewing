2579,"2017-02-22",3.6,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is fruity with some acidity. Some citrus notes with golden raisins, green grapes, tropical fruit, pineapple and melon. Some light oak and tannins. Light phenolics with some light ethyl acetate notes. Some floral and herbal notes as well. 
Pours a slightly hazy copper color with a small, thin, white head that recedes quickly to the edges where it lingers for a little bit before disappearing. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor is fairly acidic with a light sharpness to it and a hint of sweetness. Lots of citrus and pineapple in the acidity. Some green grape, golden raisin and unripe tropical fruit and melon notes. Light herbal notes with hints of oak and tannins. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium low carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, an alright beer. The acidity is too strong and kind of overwhelms the herbal notes of the gruit. The barrel character is fairly well balanced though. I just wish the acidity was dialed back by about 50%.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

2579,"2014-08-13",3.9,"> Unblended lambic type of citric sour with underripe nectarine and leathery palate
[ Bottle ][ 75cl ][ brainlair ][ Trade ][ Reidel Reisling Glass ][ 8.12.14 ]
>> Lower carbonation, hazy deep orange pour, wispy lacing. Nose is muted, apple cider vinegar, flowers, underripe green peach, some apple oxidation. Taste is extremely sour, mega citric, spicy almost, some apple cider vinegar. Big prickly bubbles. Not bad. Muted buttery oak. Super sour underripe green nectarine, leathery fruit skin. Palate is super leathery, hugely lactic, mildly salty. Green peach juice, highly acidic. On the verge of lacerating on the citric acid scale. Still, very good- and much more akin to an unblended lambic than saison or gruit. Not much spice or adjunct character, would never peg it as a gruit.
>!< highly citric, a bit over the top","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
