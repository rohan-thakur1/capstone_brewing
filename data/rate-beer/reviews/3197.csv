That is to say, Anchor California Lager is beer at its most basic, recognizable form, a step up from macro swill yet tracing a direct line from cheap industrial crap to craft quality. Hits all the lager requirements: moderately sweet malts, fruity apple notes coming from the yeast, mild Euro-hop finish tightening up the back end. A beer-tasting beer, without any noticeable flaws yet also lacking any discernible traits to make it stand out. Not bad, not by a long shot. Just normal.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

Id tend to prefer something like this to have more noticeable notes of grains involved, but this is pretty good for a crisp light drinker if youre not in the mood for a hop bomb.

3197,"2016-06-08",3.7,"355ml can from Tesco. Served cold from the fridge as befits a beer drunk for refreshment. There is a pleasant fruitiness to this which suggests a more active yeast than is commonly used in lagers, or perhaps the temperature was slightly hotter during fermentation, or they didnt ferment out fully. Whatever, its nice to get some malt character in a lager. The old fashioned hop, Cluster, is my kind of hop. Balanced and restrained and subtle. It is earthy and floral and fruity - bringing in a dusty and thirst-quenching bitterness, but also imparting a bright thin fruit, which complements and enhances the fruitiness of the malt. This beer doesnt taste American at all - this is like something from Syria or Africa. It has a wild and wonderful crudeness and character and genuine flavour. It tastes of beer, not of hops, and the malt is rough and complex and quite delightful. I havent enjoyed a lager this much for ages. Not that Im getting carried away, but I certainly would be interested in trying this again at a warmer temperature to see what it really tastes like.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

I head over there at 6:00 and the place is fucking packed, and Im like, ""nope, not waiting in a line to spend too much on beer."" So I went back to my hotel, watched some football, talked to my family, and ironed my poster for tomorrow. By 8:30 Im thinking I should give food another go, and since I dont have a better plan I go back to Mikkeller again. I dont even know why -- theres nothing on draft Im dying to try and I dont even like the place to tell you the truth. But whatever, Im in a rut, so I head back. And its less busy now ... but still way too busy. So Im all ""fuck this, Im gonna go get food somewhere else,"" and I head into the Tenderloin in search of food. I never found any, but I found something better -- Emperor Nortons Boozeland. This place is chill, and even though there are no empty spots at the first bar around the other side is mostly empty. I stake out a spot and order this beer. And its fucking great. Cold, crisp, refreshing, crushable. I could drink this all night. Seriously, the feeling drinking this is that its the best beer Ive had all trip, and that says something considering I was at Russian River and City Beer yesterday. Now all thats missing is somebody to talk to. Im sitting all alone in my own little corner of the bar (while still being *at* the bar ... just half behind a wall). And so Im sitting there, crushing this fucking great beer that I could drink all night, staring off into a corner thinking about what an introverted weirdo Ive turned out to be, when out of nowhere a guy in an ill-fitting suit walks over to me, and says, ""hey ... you here all alone? I dont want to impose, I mean, who knows, maybe this what you want to do. But Im here with a bunch of people, we just had a work christmas party, and were all on the other side of that wall -- you know, if you want to hang out and talk to people."" I shit you not, this is what he said to me, just as Im reflecting on how lonely the night is turning out to be and my inexplicable inability to just reach out and connect with another human being. Im not sure if hes hitting on me or not, but we chat for a few minutes and it all seems cool before he reiterates the invite and heads back to his party, and Im thinking this sounds like it could be exactly what tonight needs. The bartender sees my empty glass and asks if I want another, to which I reply, ""I ... dont know. Maybe? ... No, think Ill call it a night.""","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

3197,"2015-09-20",3.9,"Sampled November 2014
A soft pour from the can into my globe glass produces a three-finger thick, light tan colored head; the head is quite dense, and has lots of staying power, including leaving some lacing patterns on the sides of my glass. The beer is a nice golden copper hue that shows a clear, bright golden hue when held up to the light. The aroma is hop dominant, though the overall effect is low; notes of black currants, a slight metallic hop character, grassy herbal notes, and a touch of menthol are all noticeable. The hop aromatics are backed by cracker leaning, with just a touch of English biscuit maltiness.

Nicely balanced between malt and hop in the flavor, the beer has a nice clean flavor to it, except towards the finish where the hop character has an herbal, sort of metallic edge to it that is nice. The bitterness is nicely bitting from beginning to end, and this balances the light, chewy, cracker / bread like malt sweetness that is here. Touches of menthol, a bit of black currant, with a grassy herbal character, and even a touch of bright citrus zest round out the hop notes here. The body has a touch of viscosity to it that provides some palate heft, yet is still eminently quaffable, just as it should be.

Flavor profile is pretty well balanced with a good bit of spicy hoppiness throughout, more crackery/biscuity malt here as well as a fairly strong dosage of hop bitterness towards the finish, this straying a bit towards metallic. Palate is quite dry and high in carbonation, body is light-medium. Surprisingly flavorful. Very nice as a warm-weather quencher and all-around general purpose lager.  Unsurprisingly, tastes like what you might imagine a beer from the 19th century would.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

3197,"2015-05-30",3.0,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2015 Bottle as a gift from Helsinki. BB 1.2017. Pale straw colour with minimal haze and off-white, slightly creamy foam. The head drops fast, leaving a film and very little lace. The nose strikes at first as an abundantly hopped lager, not unlike so many others with lots of straw - but then after its been sitting for some minutes a more interesting character starts to reveal itselft. The aroma is somewhat milky or creamy, and also spicy and herbal - a curious mix. It tastes of straw, indistinct herbs and some peachy fruity notes with perhaps a drop of citrus and a tiny bit of honey sweetness. Smooth soft texture with very thin but active carbonation and herbal bitter finish. Its not bad but I would (knowing I shouldnt) probably make less of it without the accompanying texts.

3197,"2015-02-20",3.2,"Tasted as Anchor California Lager. I guess Anchor wouldnt be Anchor if no Californian tradition, in this case the Cluster hops, would be attached to it somehow. Pours a deep old gold colour, yellow blonde with an ever so subtle olive hue, very slightly hazy and with calm but steady sparkling; the very lightly greyish white head, medium thick and moussy, stays closed and densely packed the whole time and makes a clearly audible crackling sound for minutes on end. Weak and pretty straightforward, but pleasant and sweet aroma of freshly baked cake, perhaps a suggestion of dried apricot, white bread, baked banana, honey, leafy and earthy hops. Neutral onset, very lightly metallic, with sharpish carbonation, quickly becoming sourish and minerally, tingling on the palate and tongue and even numbing them for a moment, proceeding in a light but delicately bready malt sweetishness and ending in a fairly hoppy, quenching finish, leafy and grassy, pretty floral too (almost honeyish), bittering and of medium length. Worthy premium lager, and if this class is to be considered as the next best thing to a classical Pilsener, Im willing to stand up for classifying this as a genuine Pilsener - and a good one at that. The Anchor brewery, as the grandfather of American craft beer culture, has always more or less restrained from wild experiments and keeps thing simple, but never disappoints. Very decent, to say the least.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

 Appearance  The beer pours a golden amber color with a two finger head of just off-white colored head. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave a fantastic level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma of the beer is light overall with just some hints of a bready and graininess mixed with a very small amount of a floral and grassy hops. 

 Taste  The taste begins a mix of a drier cracker and bready taste as well as a little bit of a caramel and floral flavors. The caramel fades more and more as the taste advances with a bit more of a floral hop and some grassy notes taking its place. Some graininess and a slight hay-like flavor join the taste profile at the end, leaving one with a very crisp and dry, but rather clean taste to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer quite thin with a carbonation level that is a little on the higher side. Both are perfect for the lighter abv. and very crisp flavors of the brew, making for a nice easy drinking lager.,

 Overall  Crisp, crackery and somewhat moderately hopped for a lager. This is a nice summer time brew with a good flavor, but having a quite refreshing taste and feel.","","Darkmagus82"

3197,"2014-03-02",2.6,"This tastes to me basically like Pilsner in which the traditional noble hops were substituted for American cluster hops. That is all well and good but, honestly, clusters are just not very good tasting hops. I am not sure how this escaped the notice of Anchors ""Zymasters"" but apparently someone was asleep at the switch. I do like the idea of recreating a traditional and forgotten American style in theory but you dont wind up drinking the idea and this beer is just not all that great. 


As mentioned, it is somewhat along the lines of a Czech Pilsener. There is just a touch of malt character and a good amount of hops in both the nose in the finish. The hop character itself is sort of strangely tutt-fruity and the bitterness in the finish is astringent, giving this a drying quality on the tongue. It strikes me as well made beer in general in that there doesnt seem to be any oxidation or any kind of flaws that might be the result of poor process control but it simply doesnt taste all that great at the end of the day.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
3197,"2014-03-01",3.0,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours a clear golden color. The head is about one fingers high, and barely off-white. Retention is acceptable, and the lacing is thin yet consistent.

S: Typically lager-y: tons of cracker, a touch of lemon, and some grass generally comprise the aroma. No twists, turns, or excitement here; it is well-done though.

T: Apart from the crackery malts, there are some diacetyl elements right before the finish: they neither take away nor take it to the next level. The finish is slightly lemony. Not much to say about this one, really.

M: The malt backbone seems to cut in during the swallow, creating a brew thats just a hair too full. Meanwhile, its hoppiness does a reasonable job of drying the (otherwise sweetish) finish out. Carbonation - if not low - is at least gentle.

Pours crystal clear pale golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of cracker, bread, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very pleasant, clean, and well balanced malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness without feeling watery, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pale lager style. Well balanced hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Aroma strongly bready, and very subtle floral/grassy notes. Aroma is similarly bready and just a tiny bit fruity and bright. Thin mouthfeel; abrasive carbonation. If were going to compare this to Budweiser, then yeah, this is 10 times better. Versus almost anything else, this is pretty unimpressive. 95th percentile for the style, yes; but folks are sucking the Anchor teet pretty hard for this to be 70th percentile overall.

3197,"2014-02-12",3.3,"Bottle. Nose is very pleasantly malty in a very traditional way, some notes of caramel, toffee, earth, even getting some good yeast character, but really its just depth of malt thats wowing me. Clear golden pour, very effervescent with a dense sudsy off-white head. Taste is medium bitter, semi-dry with some earthen and resinous moods, malt with cigarette ash underpinnings, corn, and thin but sticky caramel that seems to have been stretched into long ribbons. Light-medium body not what Im looking for, but does help the drinkability here. Theres this Anchor soda thing going on, this one note I sometimes find in between their bubbles, usually chalking up to house character that is a negative tweak Im able to overlook. Some weird things going on here, and a second opinion might call this unclean instead of unique; it does share some qualities with dirty German and Polish lagers Ive had, but in the current marketplace, Im enthused!","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

Taste - the taste is pleasant, but not super bold. There is a hop profile typical to quality lagers, the taste is slightly spiced as well.

Clear golden orange colour; One quarter finger head and soapy white foam which fades in 30 seconds; Small sticky lacing with notable soft carbonation; Aroma of light full malt, with light honey, fresh loaf, avocado, hint of dark fruit and lemony trace; Fairly light sweet taste of malt, with moderate lemon, light yeast, fairly light liquorices, and thin grassy hops; Medium body, quite thick to oily palate; Taste profile is premium lager on the light side - full maltyness is rather thin, with good shades of buttery (not a fault) avocado, good yeast and doughty; Hoppiness is very light lemon nose and initially very low grass. Astringency gets longer and better with further sips, with light liquorices all the way to a neat, lasting finish; Slightly dry after taste, fairly easy and refreshing to mouth.

Comments: Not as big and heavy like most premium lager, this one is light, refreshing without compromising the maltyness.

3197,"2013-06-13",1.6,"Unmistakable cluster tang in the nose, also very yeast, almost banana-like, some rough cereal scents. Flavor is a dead ringer for just about any macro lager. IT has quite a bit more malt coming through and more bitterness, but the flavor itself is quite similar. I dont know if I can say this is better aside from that it isnt produced by bmc. I is definitely more cloying. Cant rate it too high simply because it isnt an amazing lager and it is aimed at replicating macro brews which I dont think is the way to go. If I want a clean lager Im gonna go pils or helles every time.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

Taste is quite soapy hoppy, sticky orange, a bit too soapy with lemon. Not a lot of quenching biscuity malt or fresh, zesty hop balance. Disappointing.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3197,"2013-06-02",4.4,"From a 12 oz. bottle, pours a beautiful light golden color with a fluffy white head. Aroma of sweet malt and light hops with a nice lager yeast character. Light mouthfeel with an appropriate amount of carbonation. Flavor of soft malt and delicate hops lead to a subtle sulphur lager finish. Great summer beer. It's too bad it's only available in Cali.

3197,"2013-04-11",3.6,"UPDATED: APR 12, 2013 If I was purely rating to style, my score would be even higher. This beer is very clean, light and refreshing with no real off-flavors. On top of that, it doesnt cheat by loading the beer up with hops and comes in at a low price point. Its a good looking lager, too. Nice bright yellow-gold color with a creamy white head that sticks around for quite a long time. Perfectly transparent. The aroma is so clean that Im not quite sure how to rate it. Theres a little bit of sweetly yeasty, doughy malt flavor and a touch of floral/herbal hops, maybe a tad bit citric. The taste starts sweet with squeaky clean, fresh, bright malt. Quickly, an herbal hop bitterness combines with a tart yeast flavor to dry the beer out. The finish is lightly malt sweet with more hop flavor/bitterness and tart yeastiness. It reminds me of a toned down German pilsener with that refreshing hard water crispness. The finish particularly has a lingering mineral character. The beer drinks very easily and sits on the palate as light as can be. Im not exactly about to run out to the store to buy more, but if I needed a macro lager substitute, I would go with this beer.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

More malty than other lagers, but still light. Nice creamy mouthfeel when you swirl it around. Its not spectacular and I think that Liberty Ale is more interesting, but Id probably prefer this to Steam (pretty much just a lighter version of it).","California, USA","jibby"

3197,"2013-03-05",3.1,"bought this one because i had never seen it before.  Im not really much of an anchor fan, but I buy their stuff because its been around for a long time and represents SF.  After getting home and actually reading the packaging, Im a little weary of the label because it says 2012.  It is now March of 2013.  ABV is less than a bud, and bud claims to stay ok for 4 months.. hopefully this one was made in december.  Pours clear yelllow orange tan.  REtains a small film and a ring of tiny bubbles.  Has an import beer smell.  maybe not terribly skunked but getting there.  Again, smells like the beer my uncles would give me on fishing trips 20 years ago,  I dont mind it.  Taste pretty much follows suit.  slight sweet, bit of lemon, then lemon peel, then pretty much light bitter finish.  Im thinking that fresh, this might be one of the best anchor beers.pretty simple, but refreshing I just cant deal with that old vegetable skunk smell at this point.  Not worth 10 dollars for 6.  probably why nobody bought them.  Ill buy again as soon as i see the 2013 label, and ill be keeping an eye out for it.","Concord, California, USA","sickassmick"

The aroma offers up sweet and lagery notes with a sort of Bohemian Pilsener sort of feel as well as a bit of floral hops. The taste is pleasing and refreshing as it delivers some fresh bready to grainy malts and then it gets a thin pulse of modestly bitter hops coming to the surface.
