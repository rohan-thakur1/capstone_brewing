3966,"2015-04-23",4.5,"Picked this one up at a hoppines,Koper. I loved the name and the label of this one, seemed very original. Poured into a pint glass.

This beer wears a tuxedo of dark brown, almost black body with a tan head. It is fleeting and mysterious. Leaves excellent and sturdy lacing no doubt from the protein content achieved from the hemp seeds.
 Very complex aroma consisting of coffe,chocolate, fruity hops, brown sugar, caramel, and faint pine. Its the smell of a great stout and a great IPA all at once.
Bursting with tropical fruit flavors from the hops with resounding and strong roasted malt characteristics. The hops are juicy in nature and deliver tantalizing flavors of tropical fruits, pineapple, mango, and pine. The malts give way to caramel, tobacco, black tea, and chocolate. It genuinely is like an amazing IPA and porter all at once, with the weight of the body hiding the alcohol perfectly. This strong beast drinks like a 6% but is a whopping 8,1%. Extremely satisfying and delicious. 

This beer is perfect and satisfying. It fulfills expectations from both Imperial IPAs and porter, which is no easy task. One of the best beers.
