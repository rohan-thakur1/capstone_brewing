378,"2017-02-19",3.5,"33.5 cl partagée avec la BXL tasting crew, merci Pierre T.
Dorée sur léger voile, col blanc modéré.
Arôme au nez assez subtil de barrique, funk avec une petite note presque abricot en rétro-nasal. Jai un peu de mal à croire en la complexité de lhistoire de la bière où les levures sauvages contenues dans une barrique de sherry auraient trouvés refuge dans une autre barrique neutre en emmenant leur caractère de sherry.
Palais est sec, grains, citornné un peu de côté cartonné avec un caractère de boisé perdurant et léger funk. Ok correct sans vraiment comprendre le prix vs. résultat.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

378,"2016-12-31",4.4,"(375ml bottle) cloudy gold, yeast chunks, fine offwhite bubbles. Nose of sherry, forest floor, gueuze funk, lemon zest, horseblanket and aged hops. Complex in every way. Restrained nicely. Reminds of a traditional gueuze with a unique sherry element. Taste of lemon zest, funk, seltzer, aged hops, touch of moss, tastes absolutely delicious. So easy to drink.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
378,"2016-12-16",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 17, 2016 On draft at the source. Pours dark gold color. Small hint of sherry, oak. Light mouthfeel. Peach, lemon juice. If you have this beer dont crack it out of the fridge let it come closer to room temperature to help bring out the sherry character. This beer might also benefit from decanting.","Bellaire, Texas, USA","gephross100"
378,"2016-11-03",4.3,"Pour from a 375 ml bottle at the Shelton Brothers Festival. Pours a hazy gold color with a small white head that settles into a patchy film and a ring. Notes of sawdust, lemon, vanilla, stone fruits, wheat and dry grains, grass, herbs, and a relatively sharp acidic note throughout. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a tart, funky, musty mouthfeel. Excellent stuff. Id love to track these SPON bottles down and spend some more time with them.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
