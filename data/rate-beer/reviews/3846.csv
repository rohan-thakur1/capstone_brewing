3846,"2016-01-31",4.1,"16 oz can shared with ebone1988. Got this gem from Eddie in a trade and I'm happy to share. The pour is a darker orange color with a thin white head and a lingering soapy lace. It looks pretty good. The aroma is pretty good as well. There is a lot of pine and resin bitterness. The hops are present and dank for sure. It's nicely fruity and bitter. I'm a fan. The flavor is really good. There is a great hop bitterness. The dank fruitiness brings up the rear and it's a little layered and delicious. It's juicy and lovely. The mouth feel is a little thicker and well carbonated. It's got a lingeringly juicy fruit hop that is wonderful. I'm a fan of this!

The aroma explodes with lots stone and tropical fruit. Mango, melon, pineapple, papaya with some background citrus notes of grapefruit and orange. Very potent and juicy. The flavor is pretty much the same with loads of pineapple, mango, peach and melon. Light grassy astringency in the finish, no doubt from all the hops. Very light bready malt character, but the body feels rather full with some light honey and spice notes. The finish is medium to strongly bitter with more citrus, grass and tropical fruit.

3846,"2015-12-12",4.5,"Fresh cans, only a few days old, drunk 12/11/15.Ok, so I was very suspicious of the whole New England cloudy IPA thing when it first started being a thing at HF, Tree House and Trillium. It just seems so anti what a good pale ale should be; these arent hefeweizens, after all. But 2 years later, whatever the case, Im a believer. And to go even farther than that, Trilliums recent ""clarity problem"", the problem being that their pales and ipas are now nearly clear, is actually concerning. As it seems like there has been a drop in quality that has come exactly with this new clarity. Of course, maybe the two things are completely unrelated, but I dont think so....Anyways, thats a very long-winded way of saying how much I appreciate the heavily hazy character still found at Tree House. Alter Ego is a very sunset-hued, hazy orange-golden beer with a small white head and moderate retention.Melon, pineapple, stonefruits, juicy tangerine, pretty much all the best characteristics these hops have to offer and little/none of the bad stuff. No punch/tang, no resin, no green onion (or very minimal, at most). Light biscuits and honey from the malt, which is delicately done and plays only a small role, as it should. No alcohol or flaw.Flavor follows suit. Bright citrus, dank, leafy, green notes, tropical fruits and a lingering, heavily retronasal watermelon note. Perfect attenuation and balance with a good, but not overdone bitterness. This, like most of the other beers at Tree House, is some of the very best beer being brewed on this planet. Always a treat! Cheers to Nate and the rest of the gang. (Also the guy a few reviews down that says this ""dosent hold up to Julius"" should definitely go ahead and read up on what this beer is.....)","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The mosaic isnt as strong, but cuts the sweet orange happiness. Orange flavor really comes through in the back end. Low bitterness. Really drinkable. Creamy carbonation. Medium body. Absolutely delicious. Makes me feel like Ive never given Julius a fair shake.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

3846,"2015-06-12",4.0,"750ml growler thanks to Reynolds and Ernesto. Pours hazy golden with a white head. Aroma of strong fruity hops like Julius, some light malts, and light dough. Flavor dominated by the strong citrusy and fruity hops. Average texture. A cool beer, basically Julius.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
