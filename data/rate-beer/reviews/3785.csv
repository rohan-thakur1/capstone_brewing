3785,"2012-03-26",3.7,"Pour on tap at the brewery, dark brown pour with nice off white head, aroma brought notes of big banana and clove with a rich caramel and toffee, hints of dark fruits mixing with the fruity esters, smells nice!  Taste is just as nice, with nice banana and clove, hints of esters with a nice spicy middle touch of caramel and dark fruits, finishing fairly sweet but dries nicely.  Not quite at the level of the classic German ones, but very tasty.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
3785,"2012-02-12",3.6,"A nice amber color, with a smooth Belgian like taste that is not overly sweet. Very drinkable even for the higher alcohol content.","Farmington, Minnesota, USA","XmnwildX12"

3785,"2005-12-10",3.9,"Sampled from a growler courtesy of kms399: Pours a transparent orange copper with a thin off-white head.  Spicy clove, bubble gum and bready yeast aroma has a nice caramel presence.  Body starts with a good, sweet, toasty, and dry caramel maltiness with lots of yeasty esters and good authenticity.  Hides the abv very well.  Thanks ken!","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3785,"2005-12-03",3.7,"Murky apple and orange brown pour, with no head, but an opalescent film. Lucious malty wheat and lemon; classic, but deep and sweet with brown sugar. Really full of hexane, but backed with a gentle sourness that I somewhat seek in this style. Sweet and clingy. Finish is strong with some alcohol with some rounding background. Lacks some of the toothy chewiness that I like in the style.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3785,"2005-11-28",3.8,"Growler- Thanks Tom!- Pours a dark brown color, slightly amber, no head, but lots of bubbles rushing up!  Aroma of sweet malts, dark fruits, spice, and banana. Flavor is sweet fruit, beautiful marriage of the two styles, licorice, caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, Tasty!","Mississippi, USA","Mangino"
3785,"2005-11-28",3.9,"Growler shared ala CaptainCougar. Dark amber to copper color  smaller head that settles to a small lid of tan bubbles. Bananas foster along with a sweet hearty fruit bread aroma . Sweet wheat start with nuances of fruit and mild spice. Thick and chewy feel. Very smooth and drinkable for the heft. Perhaps too sweet and chewy at times but still a very nice offering.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
3785,"2005-11-28",3.9,"Growler shared by CaptainCougar - thanks, Tom!  Glowing, translucent scarlet brown in color with no head and little movement elsewhere.  Pepper and bananas leap out of the glass with a supporting cast of cloves, cinnamon and spicy eccentricity.  Toned carbonation and a sweet syrupy vibe that bodes oh so well.  Fried bananas in brown sugar.  Pepper and cloves for an impressive spiced oomph.  Caramel and mild toffee further the sweet symphonic rendition while a syrupy element continues the chorus.  Well done!","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
3785,"2005-11-16",3.3,"3 oz taster at the brewery with the DanmanMilk. Great head initially then dead still. Great wonderful full-out black pepper in the nose, clove too. The flavor was sweet and cloying, with big clove and raw sugar elements. The palate was sticky. Good but not all the way there. Light in color too, befitting its incompleteness. The aroma was killer though.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
3785,"2005-11-14",4.1,"Deep, dark mahogany appearance with a sweet banana aroma. The taste is of dark fruit, wheat and banana on the nose. The palate is wonderful- thick and lush and creamy. Not a hint of the abv until you feel it 3/4 through the pint. Truly enjoyable. Happy 8th anniversary Town Hall.","Mt Kisco, New York, USA","Brewso"
3785,"2005-11-13",3.3,"Dark Brown Coloring.  Wheat and Banana Aroma.  Many Flavors Coupled into This Brew...Malts and Grains...Light Spice....Notably Some Warming, Medium Mouthfeel and Overall Well Done and Quite Enjoyable.","Minnesota, USA","robertsreality"
3785,"2005-11-10",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 29, 2008 This was labelled as ""8"" and ""Hefe Weizen"" by the brewery. Cheers to Tavernjef for sending. My second home run with this brewery in two at bats. A trip to the freezing city is being contemplated. Creamy mouthfeel. Intense complex flavour excellently malted. Barleywine appearance with an enormous retained head.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"

3785,"2005-11-03",3.9,"8th Anniversary for Town Hall, time for a new one-time beer to celebrate, and this time its a weizenbock. Hooray for celebrations!

Dark amber hue, nearly a crimson color, short-lived head in the glass...

Aroma is sweet, wheaty, hints of banana and spices, very lively and up;lifting, I like it, I like it...elevating, almost...quite nice.

Taste: Fruity and tasty, a big leap on the palate, then smooth and delicious, very mild-mannered texture, but not shy, not light, not afraid of flooding the mouth with flavor...which it does, to a degree.
I can drink this all night long, but not everyone can, it is an acquired taste...one I prefer, of course, and while it could be better, this is an excellent execution. 

This makes an admirable addition to the Anniversary canon, but some may find it wanting, and they are those that demand perfection in every endeavor and shock-and-awe around every corner...theres plenty of that in so many other offerings from these folks, that it seems ridiculous to expect that of them contantly. Especially since it seems that theyve covered nearly every style you can name, and made a few up along the way!

So, Happy 8th Town Hall, Ill enjoy this weizonbock while I may, ...then get back into my hop jones, man!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
3785,"2005-11-03",4.2,"Fresh growler 11/2/05: Darkly glowing scarlet gem with a loosely puffed light brown capping. Thins out quickly to nothing but a super skinny collar. Very minimal lacing in drippy spottings.

Aroma is peppered with a yeasty spiced presence of floral ethanol.
Light background of toasted toffee and a pinch of mint. Takes a darker fruity turn as it warms bringing dates and figs.

Taste is eager in light malts that are of a darker realm in the fruity areas of the palate. Peppery areas grab the overall then dash away. Although will return later...Very tender and mildly set with a great length of character. Slippery front with light toasted toffee, middle is where the fruits become larger with dates, banana, raisin, and figs. Nice bready undercarriage. Very raisin bread-like but candyish coated with dark sugars. Lofty long finish with lightly drying floral yeast and spice fading into one lovingly warm warmth. Tiny nuances of cinnamon, mint, and peppered candy sneak into the warming areas as it finishes. Challenging complex and changing.

Feel is medium bodied and lightly spiced and peppery with yeast. Very smooth and lightly creamy with a very delicate carbonation and calming malt base. Mildly sugar coated and spiced throughout and one very welcome warming finish.

A very nice brew. A hard style to keep from going in all sorts of directions. This seems very distinguished and well made. More will be needed as its drinkability is quite fine and pleasantly warming.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
3785,"2005-10-31",4.1,"Slightly hazy, red/maroon color.  Delicious front, beautiful aroma, raisins, wheat, and like others said ""no banana"" but I wasnt really in need of it.  Moderate carbonation, not fluffy but exciting nevertheless.  Hard to describe with excellent robust flavors.  This is a style I dont know a ton about, so I wasnt really making a style-driven comparison, and I think that was a good thing, as this was hedonistically very easy to drink and enjoy.  (on tap at brewpub)","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
3785,"2005-10-30",3.9,"8th anniversary release. I was there when JK and Badgerben were sampling this brew and neither really liked it. I dont know what they were thinking. I thought it was outstanding. Definitely some banana and wheat in the nose but also some pale lager. I sampled from Bens glass, as he left early to go back to work. It was completely flat, no head, no lace, no carb. But this did not translate to the mouthfeel. Beautiful reddish amber. High alcohol profile. There is a definite carbonation zing on the tongue; kind of an electricity. This is really tasty.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
3785,"2005-10-29",3.4,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2006 The beer was served too cold and lacked all character; it was nearly indistinguishable from the Belgian ale they were serving at the same time.  As it warmed the qualities started to show.  The beer is cloudy brown with a small white head.  The aroma has some wheat and light citrus; the aroma leads to the expectation of a sweet beer.  This is like a light dunkelweizen.  All appropriate aromas and flavors are there but a little lighter than they should be. Still a fairly good beer when it has a chance to warm.  This one will be available for a while, and it is great to see TH branch out into another style.  -----A month after my first taste, the beer has had some time to mature and subtle flavors of wheat and citrus and more abundant, but still seem underdone.  The alcohol bite remains. Good.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
3785,"2005-10-29",3.4,"Town Hall 8th Anniversary, Saturday release:  Deep red color with no head.  Very good wheaty and banana aroma.  It actually smells a little syrupy too.  The taste gets funky.  Dry wheat and malt show up in abundance, but the banana disappears which really is part of the signature for this style.  Almost a little sour, too.  Not bad, but outshone by the other beers released this week.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
