Aroma is barnyard action, oak barrel, vanilla, tart, acidic, yeast, grape. Medium bodied, acidic, tart (not overly so - really nice balance of flavors) with of course brett with some barrel sweetness to round it out.","California, USA","ABUSEDGOAT"
3129,"2016-05-25",4.4,"Lactic sour, oaky Woody, dry grape, white wine aroma and flavor. Not too sour, maybe 4 or 5 of 10 sour and virtually all lactic, but with a little earthy funk in the finish. Carbonation dies fast. Really complex and balanced and a solid sour. A notch below the greats I think with the low dying carbonation and the earthy funk in the finish ( but the earthy funk does compliment the dry oaky white wine and balances with the lactic sour, the earthy funk balance may be a benefit for some... And the more I drink the more I like the balance the slight funk provides). Bumping up a notch the more I have. So complex and so good, only negative now is the lack of carbonation.

Aroma of white wine, lemon juice, oak, herbs and spices, dusty grains, plum skins, wildflowers - really sharp and fresh and tart. Flavor of white wine, plums, lemon, wet hay, grass, mild spices, vanilla, wildflowers, apple, funk, and tannins. Medium-bodied, with modest carbonation and a fruity, vinous, funky, tart mouthfeel that starts cleaner and muddles up over time. Really good but I was picky on this one since Ive been excited for it for a long time.

3129,"2016-02-18",3.7,"Draught at the Merchant, 2/9/16.Bright flaxen-yellow body shows a light to moderate haze and is topped by a medium-sized white head that slowly fades to cover.Spice and herbs come out in the nose, up front, and are joined by a buttery oak character that is mitigated somewhat by a strong lemon-like citrus element. Hay and wheat-like graininess in the background is pleasing and helps keep things light and beer-like, while the grape character seems only lightly apparent from the nose (more estery and spicy than tremendously wine-like). Brett shows key limes, pineapple and soft guava notes, lending brightness.Buttery oak and rich, developed brett acids contend with a lightly grainy maltiness that adds a crispness in concert with the tart acidity and light grape must qualities. Light sweetness helps balance (a light, honey-like pale malt) and though its quite woody and barrel-influenced, its never astringent/husky. Floral and fruity notes emerge with warming, but I can never quite shake the slight overabundance of buttery oak that does not go well at all with what the bright, tart, lighthearted brett and grape notes are trying to do. Carbonation is moderately tight, though a touch loose at times. Texture ranges from grainy to softly malty with a touch of oak slickness to it as well. Perhaps this seemed more revolutionary 8 years ago? Its certainly a very competent sour, but doesnt strike me as the best of the best.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Pours a crystal clear deep golden color with a huge white head that dissipates like the head on a diet soda. I can smell the funk as soon as I pop the cap on this one. Lemony tartness mixed with a sour grape fruitiness along with a mild bit of sweet candy malts and a solid hit of barnyard funkiness make up the aroma. The flavor is extreme lemony citric tartness. The grape flavor comes through a little along with a hint of sweet candy like malts and barnyard funk, but this one is all about the tart.

Batch 4

A: The beer is a golden hue, which comes as no surprise as this is labeled as a golden ale. There is a white, bubbly head that fizzes away almost immediately after pouring. The beer is mostly clear, with only a slight haze.

S: Apples, grapes, funk, wild yeast, oak,wine, tart fruits.

T: A really delicious sour ale. Apples, grapes and pears balance well with notes of oak and a prominent wild yeast component. There is a tannic presence as well, reminiscent of a fine French sauvignon blanc. Well done.

M: Very tart. Nice feel with a fairly low carbonation level. Alcohol hidden pretty well.

D: A delectable treat. I hope I have the pleasure of indulging in this fine beverage again in the near future. It would be worth driving to the release and waiting in line to obtain this.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

Ive been gradually growing into sours over the last year or so.  If I wasnt fully aboard the sour bandwagon yet, this one did the trick.  If you dont like this beer, you hate sours (note: you may actually hate beer) Its up there with the best and rightfully so.  Tons of tart, funky fruit, grapes, white wine, and yeast come together to create an amazing beer. The citrus and acidity are spot on for me. Theres not much fault that I could find in this beer.

My Super Bowl beer, tasted on 2/5/12 from a capped 375mL bottle obtained in a trade.  Pours hazy golden with a thin, bubbly white head, that recedes fairly quickly to nothing at all.

The flavor is sour lemon peel up front, with a lightly sweet grape note, moving to the barnyard funk which is similar to some wild ciders I have tried.  The body is medium with a nice tannic structure, lighter than average carbonation, and a very long sour grape and funky barnyard finish.

3129,"2011-06-06",4.0,"Partial vertical made possible by three separate people. I am reviewing batch 2, 3, and 4.

Beers were poured into wine glasses side by side. None of them had a head or lacing. All were light yellow in color.

Batch 2 - very cloudy and hazy. Im not convinced that it was yeast from being disturbed from the bottom of the bottle. The aroma was quite bretty, Brett b I think mostly, quite funky with a hint of acetic tinge. Beer is oddly thin with a good forward lactic acid, no sweetness, mild tartness.

Batch 3 - very clear and highly carbonated. It looked like champagne in the glass. Very bright. This beers aroma was quite sweeter with cherries and oak. Beer was still quite sour, less brett and funky, dominant lactic with a trail of acetic.

Batch 4 - The newest batch just released a few weeks ago. This beer is cloudy again, moderately carbonated. Aroma is strongly sweet, much much sweeter than the other two. Mostly lactic, not much acetic in this one. The aroma is the strongest out of the three, nice. This beer has quite the brett bite to it, good funk, some oakiness I didnt detect in the others.

3129,"2011-03-29",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 24, 2011 BATCH 4 375ml bottle shared with MartinT. 
Appearance : Clear yellow with a small head. Short retentino, no lacing.

Aroma : Awesome tropical brett with nice sourness and citrusy tartness. A bit acetic.

Taste : Awesome tropical fruits, citrusy tartness. A bit acetic, carbonation is a bit soft. 

Overall : Wow very nice beer. The acetic notes are not to my taste but its not too much in this case. Awesome brett flavours, great tartness. Not as good as batch 1 which seemed more bretty (tropical fruits) and slightly less acetic but its still a grand beer. Im lowering my rating to reflect this batch more recent batch. Appearance slightly disapointing.
 
BATCH 1 750ml bottle at saturday night hotel tasting. EBF 2011. 
Appearance : Hazy pale yellow.

Aroma : Awesome citrusy and funky with nice tropical fruits. A little bit lactic and tannic. Best nose ever.

Taste : Great tartness with a nice sourness. Light lactic and tannic. Awesome funk with light dust. Awesome tropical fruits. 

Overall : Cant believe that the first Cuvée de Castleton I try is the batch 1. Thanks to Mike for bringing this. Nose is just divine. One of the most sure 10 I gave until now. Tropical fruits with citrusy tartness is just so perfect. Nice light funk with a little bit of lactic acid and tannins. Taste is also amazing.

3129,"2011-03-28",3.3,"375ml bottle into my De Struise glass. Batch 4...A light honey gold pour, decent carbonation at first but falls quickly with very light lacing...The aroma is pretty nice, Brute lite; acidic but lightly bready, small oak notes, white wine (sauvigon blanc) characteristics (light grass)...The taste is a bit of let down, displays too many of the white wine qualities in taste and feel. The more you drink the more vinous it gets, more oak and light feeling wine pour through. Weird alcohol finish, but pretty flat.

Earthy funk aroma with lots of bretty effervescence, barnyard mustiness, oak and light fruit notes.

3129,"2010-12-29",4.5,"Batch 4. Shared by a local BA on 09.23.2010.

Pours a hazy, but vibrant aureolin. Liquid peaches.

This is a case of how different something can smell depending on your perspective. My tasting partner said peaches, and I got a good bit of that, but for me the dominating aroma was urea, probably from the muscat grapes. Lots of citrus: lemon myrtle, lemon curd, some tangerine from the esters. My guess is that they used Orange Muscat grapes here, but thats just a guess based on the nose. Brett balances this one out. In the mouth, this is almost a fruit salad: peach, lemon, orange. Some floral attributes as well. A lactic tang keeps me coming back for more. Refreshingly tart. 

I cant help but give this top marks.

We (beerloco, mrs. beerloco, myself, and pythonhgr) tried a Batch 3 and Batch 2 bottle side by side today. As predicted, the batch 2 is much drier with more pronounced wild yeast notes. The fruity citric quality is disappearing on the batch 2 though.

7/19/09 REVIEW BATCH 3
Batch 3 bottle (375ml) picked up at the release today which was a blast!

Appearance: Cloudy light golden hue with a 1 finger white crown that dissipates rapidly and leaves little lacing.

Smell: A whirlwind of brett, muscat grapes, oak, and green apples.

Taste: Good amount of tartness and sourness. I cant wait to see what that component is like with some age on the bottle. Brett dominates while green apples and muscat grapes round out this wild golden ale.

Mouthfeel: Med-thin bodied with active carbonation.

Drinkability: I want to drink this all nigh long but if you are prone to heart burn Id say avoid that idea.

Home Run Captain Lawrence...

Flavor is very juice-like with more sweet elder flowers and quite an acidic bite followed by a long dry finish with lingering oak, brertt and bitter tannins, vinous, lively and very complex.

3129,"2009-12-19",4.2,"375 ml bottle courtesy of many possible people. I opted to go with the Batch 3 over the Batch 2s I have, largely just because I wanted to save the Batch 2s a bit longer and I wanted to continue my bottle series of 375s put out by Captain Lawrence (2 on display, 2 more to open!). Pours a champagnesque golden hue, well hazed with a big white carbonation driven head that dies to next to nothing, laces minimally. Very carbonated, the beer gives off some very pleasant aromas: a nice funkiness greets the palate, with barnyard, a touch of vinegar, acidic citrus and chardonnay hit the nose pretty strong, with fuzzy peach and pineapple pushing even further ahead of them, a touch dry, the oak comes through well, wet wood dancing on the nose and drying the beer out, vey much like champagne. The funkiness lingers more, of hay and soft cheese at this point. , the sweeter Muscat grapes come into play, a big blast of pineapple I feel, but still leave the brew dry, tart, oaky, with a decent funk on the nose. Initial is medium bodied, letting a good carbonation and prickly sourness dance on the palate. A good fruit body throws white grapes, some pear, and citrusy fruits on pretty strong, light peach, wet wood as well, and a dry champagne yeast feel. The fruit and sourness blend well, with any funk playing second fiddle on the backend. Still, a touch of barnyard brett does come into play, a lively carbonation, and tartness really push it further into the fold though. Some cereal grains, a faint vanilla, and the oak come back. This is really a great beer, especially for a champagne drinker like myself. Dry and fruity, yet well carbonated and sour, although not overbearing like many sours or lambics. The funk, while restrained, still makes its presence felt. This beer has great aging potential and leaves me very excited to open a Batch 2 and see how things progressed over more time. Cheers!","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Lovely beer and the one that probably, more than the rest, put CL on the map in terms of beer geek lust.  This bottle has been sitting for a couple years and in that time has cleared considerably from how I remember it fresh, now a bright though pale golden color with only slight haze.  Aroma is a burst of grape and floral yeast, very tropical and citrus with lemon, lime, pineapple, mango, and also slight cheesy funk.  Very sour, more than I recall from this batch, with some pronounced, tart vinous character beneath it all.  Not much hop bitterness.  Some lingering cheesy funk.  Nice beer.

Flavor reveals the muscats beautifully, and is surrounded by preserved lemon-rind, fireweed honey, and brett notes.  Not overly sour, but there is a nice tartness to counterbalance the sweet elements.  I dare say I can detect, and am thoroughly enjoying, a buttery chardonnay oakiness.

The flavor follows and strikes a good balance between tart fruits and lactic sweetness. Soured grapefruit, tart peaches, and muscat grapes rush forward on the flavors and the french oak really ties everything together by adding a nice vinous feel to it all. The funk is definitely there, but I could see this getting funkier over time. Medium bodied and smooth mouthfeel with fine carbonation that leads to a dry and very refreshing finish.

3129,"2009-08-24",4.1,"375ml bottle thanks to bret27 (another awesome little bottle for belgian-style homebrew).   Hazy blond color with a somewhat fizzy, yet lasting white head.   The aroma is an intense blast of zesty and sour lemons and other fruit, but also has a nice soft sweetness that rounds it out and keeps your nose returning for more.   The flavor has a relatively simple tart, lemony yoghurt, and apple flavor, with a very acidic finish.   The oak and grapes play second fiddle to the bacteria, but add nice nuance.   Almost creamy in texture with soft carbonation.   This is really sour stuff, but has a soft, balanced feel overall that makes it very drinkable and inviting.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

Smell is fabulously tart and funky. Initial palate has very good tingle. Initially the taste is really enjoyable and sour, then it morphs, with each sip into something a little more bitter. Sour yes, but also malty and hoppy at the same time.  The bitterness does not override the session but fer certain it has its presence. Not a whole lot of funky in this brew, as with many real lambics. Hides the 6% alky content well. Bitterness keeps poking at the back of my throat after each slug.  At times, I think it is even getting bile-ish to an extent. Tho very sour & solid, Could have much less bitterness on the finish. I think, however, it was designed into the brewing of this beer.

Flavor is mostly tangy sourness with a little bit of citrus fruit and some green apple. Citrus is much more apparent in the aroma. Oak aging adds some depth to the flavor and chills all the sourness out a bit. Gives it some wood flavors working way in the background. On first sip you get some grapes and fruit up front but that fades into a sour tanginess that stays on your lips for a while.

A - Pours a mirky yellow/orange color...reminds me of a mimosa. Very fizzy champagne-esk head. It quickly vanishes and leaves no lacing whatsoever. The beer looks flat (but isnt at all).

S - Tart lip-puckering sour notes. Sour apples, grapes, oak woodiness. Some sweetness in there as well, but nothing I can pick off the top of my head. Maybe some oranges or sweet cirtus of some kind, not exactly sure here.

T - Sour apples, grapes, oak. The sour and oak notes meld together well. A nice tart finish but not extreme like other examples of this style. Im really digging this one.

M - Light in body. Nice fizzy carbonation on the palate with a dry/clean finish. Like Ive said above, reminds me a lot of a fine champagne (in a good way).

Strong aroma with lots of green tart apples, sourness, wet leather and I guess what some would call horse blanket (or sweaty farmyard animal).  Color is a clear bright yellow.  Light sourness that is not overpowering.  Just enough to make the mouth salivate constantly.  More green apples, lemon, tartness and white grapes.  Very reminiscent of a dry white wine.

Appearance: Pours a cloudy, pale yellow body with an initially large white head, though it soon dissipates. Though, even a modest swirl of the glass easily revives it.

Smell: Pleasantly scented nose of sweetish malts, lightly tart, well-oaked white wine, lavender, funky Brett notes, and with a distinct whiff of Matts 1978 Gas Line Lemonade.

Taste: Sweet pale maltiness alongside a sharp taste of lemon sherbet with a pop of bright acidity. Thin ripples of lavender. Muscat grapes marinated in white wine and honeydew melon juice laced with subtly funky flourishes of Brett. Zip of spicy oak character. Finishes dry, acidic, and with a final bump of tart fruitiness.

Thanks to Paul for cracking this open before the real tasting started.  If it had come out later I would not have appreciated it nearly as much.  From Batch 2 it has held up well in the time between bottling and now.

Aroma / Appearance - Cloudy and golden the fluid body hugged the curves of the glass.  Hazy and thick it released a nice mix of white grape, orange citrus, and dry champagne-like aspects.  Reminding me more of a wine than a sour ale it certainly is different from the norm.

Flavor / Palate - Grape, sourdough, and non-carbonated champagne fill the mouth with a dryness that leaves you wanting more.  This is one of the best sours I have tried although a few we opened later in the night blew even this away.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Perhaps a Scottish or Irish brew for my heritage or something from my homestate of NJ but alas I have no new Heavyweights to rate and did not bring back anything from my trip abroad a few years ago.

(If I was the sentimental type this is where that little tear would form in the corner of my eye but luckily Im Scottish and other then anger and drunkenness my senses are dead.) The day ended with a stop off at Oak Tree Buy Rite on the ride home. The only way this day could have been better is if I could have stayed longer at the CL party. Now onto the beer:....Pours like a hazy champagne with a milky gold body and an ample bubbly mostly white head that once it disipates its gone, sort of like a young girls virginity. The aroma is funky, barnyard, sour white grapes, slight oak and some underlying smoke from the barrel. Palate is spot on with nice bubbly carbonation that fills your mouth as you swallow, but not overpowering, slight sourness on the finish yet very refreshing. Flavor is dominated by funkiness with the sourness kicking in nicely to remind you that this is no first timers beer. Citrus, sl","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"

Not much oak character at all or fruit. Very poor appearance, poorly lasting head and a gusher. I had batch 1 several times and didnt like it. I guess I just dont understand this beer. It doesnt seem to have much finesse.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
3129,"2009-01-30",3.5,"750ml bottle batch 2 courtesy of Tayner. This immediately gushed but I didnt lose hardly any because I had my glass ready. Cloudy, dull yellow with a white head that disappeared instantaneously. The smell is faint and sour, spice, urine? Biting sour flavor with a slight hint of a lemon at the end and brett. Overall this was pretty sour but it didnt really hit the right note for me, maybe it needs more time in the bottle. The one thing I did really like about this beer is that it had the faintest taste of Capn Crunchs Crunch Berries, which was cool.

A pale dirty yellow brown with a white head that vanished almost instantly. Full on lemon aroma, there is some excellent barrelly sourness and wooden notes but it’s completely overridden by the citrus. The flavour is similar. Just way too much lemon. To be honest, it’s a bit of a charlatan if you ask me. It’s just a pretty standard blonde with lots of tarty lemon added. It seems to be the only source of acidity and tartness. Even the dryness feels forced. The finish is excellent but it’s just lemon again. Don’t get me wrong this is a nice beer all round (apart from the looks) but it’s certainly one dimensional and rated far to high if you ask me.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

The muscat grapes come through as well (those are fantastic grapes). Very tart - almost candy tart - but I can certainly see this being one I’d like better every time I got the opportunity to try it.

3129,"2008-10-31",4.8,"Batch 1, aged about 1.5 years.  Courtesy Morgan from Great Orlando Beer Festival. Holy Mother is this beer fantastic!  The body is a cloudy, glowing, yellowish-tangerine color.  A tiny white cap of foam recedes quickly to a swirly film, minimal, spotty lacing marking the glass.  Tiny, effervescing streams of micro-bubbles pool into the surface of what otherwise might resemble some sort of tropical fruit punch.This might very well be the best smelling beer I have ever come across.  Fresh, tart, citric grapefruits, both ruby red and standard white varieties, take center stage.  Ascorbic lemon enters the fold, followed by tart peach, sweet mango, and hints of orange peel.  Signature French oak and mildly funky, wild yeast finish off the nose, which ultimately comes off as a beautiful hybrid of tropical Sauvignon Blanc, Muscat, and sour ale.Its hard to imagine a flavor that could match the sweet symphony of aromas that this beauty emits, but this one achieves it.  Somehow, puckering tartness and fruity, tropical sweetness strike a perfect balance.  Theres so much funky fruit going on here, its hard to take it all in.  Sour grapefruit, sweet-tart peach, mango, Muscat grapes, and perhaps even some pineapple all shine.  The barrel influence is just right, imparting a very wine-like feel to the end product, while the wild, funky yeast lets you know it is ale.Ultra-fine, Champagne-like carbonation tickles the tongue ever so gently after each breathtaking sip.  The light, vinous body is so refreshing, it is incredible.  Dry, ascorbic, puckering and soft, this simply begs to be drunk.Quite simply put, this beer is world-class.  Period.  Point blank.  WORLD CLASS.  Easily one of the best ales I have ever laid nose or lip to.  I can hear Batch 2 calling out to me from the cellar, tempting me, daring me to drink it.  It is taking every ounce of restraint I can muster to wait for the right time to crack that bad boy open.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

It pours almost no head with a carbonation like soda pop and a clear yellow color. The smell is slightly sour with some white wine characteristics and dry bouquet. Taste is a dry white wine with some subtle sour flavors in the background. Still a good mouthfeel with carbonation not overpowering, but giving a good soft acidity.

Light of body, serciously acidic and still, with an almost puckeringly sour/dry aftertaste.

The flavor is very vinous, spicy oak, yeasty, the tart/sour character isn’t dominating and plays a nice complimentary role in the beer. The grapes and spices show also show well. Very lively and exciting mouthfeel, the carbonation is very tactile and the overall body of the beer does not disappoint either.

Ive been saving this one for a special occasion, and rating #1000 seems as good an occasion as any. It opens with a puff and begins slowly gushing foam until I pour it out hazy and golden, with more large clumps of orange-ish floaty material than I would like to see. Fascinating nose: the muscat grapes come on strong here, lots of passionfruit and some pineapple, golden raisins. Flavor like scooping passionfruit seeds out of a fresh fruit that has been drizzled with lemon juice, quite strongly acidic but not overly so. And then chardonnay-like oak and grapes adding complexity, plenty of sweetness (but not enough to make this a sweet-tart sour) to keep things diverse. It took my palate eight ounces or so to adjust relative to the dry, minerally, lactic beers Ive been drinking, but now that Ive  made the switch this one is really coming off as very good. Unfortunately, as it warms there is this rancid mandarin orange thing going on that is not a virtue, and near room temperature that almost dominates. . Light and refreshing (though never watery) on the tongue, great lemon close. Its a very different beer from sour gems coming off the West  Coast, but once one puts those expectations aside this thing is an artwork in its own right.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Nice, but not overwhelming.  Complex, but not as world-class as I would think by the ratings.
I think the understated nature of this beer is what is getting people.  Has a load of complexity, grapes, sourness, oak, everything.  
Its growing on me.  847516
----- Batch 3 consumed relatively fresh------- is very intense muscat grape and residual sweetness, funk, horse, citrus, honey suckle....
Taste is a bit flabby, sweet and sprite with some mouth puckering sourness, muscat grape, and funk.
Finish is still a bit sweet, more grape, and some acidity.  
Needs a few years.  Rating unchanged","Kirkwood, Missouri, USA","xmarcnolanx"
3129,"2008-07-28",3.8,"Bottle from the brewery on the release day. It smelled incredible, so much going on, it was wonderful, definite sour smell, the taste is fruity but tart with some spice and a lot going on. I don’t really know much about sour ales and probably wouldn’t buy this again or drink again by choice but it is an incredibly complex beer that I would love to try again once I’ve learned more about sours.","The World of Beer, Texas, USA","Haslinger"
3129,"2008-07-27",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2009 Bottle, batch 2 sampled the day of the release.  Pours a cloudy light orange with a fizzy white head (careful when opening!).  Aroma of tart sour fruits (apple, pear), oak/barrel, and some grapey wine notes, especially as the beer warms.  Flavor of sweet tart oak, same fruits as in the aroma.  I have to admit that I havent been impressed with some of Captain Lawrences special release beers, but thankfully this beer lived up to its reputation and more!  An awesome sour, super drinkable, very complex and interesting.  Excellent and well crafted.
Update 7/27/2009.  Batch 3.  Aroma is super lemony and citrus, perhaps there are some grapes in there too.  Flavor is funky and sour upfront with a wheaty finish.  Not as fruity as the aroma (although still fruity).  Very drinkable as well.  Very very similar to Batch 2 I think.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LilBeerDoctor"
3129,"2008-07-26",4.9,"UPDATED: SEP 4, 2009 batch 3 bottle the same stellar beer! wonderful aroma that has a little less of the sweet grape but more funk and sourness. leans a little more dry but waters the mouth with amazing flavors. still fantastic for me and the carbonation is spot on. 

750 bottle batch#2 picked up fresh today at the release. poured a slightly hazed yellow golden color with small bubbles of light carbonation when swished in the glass. aroma has plenty of horse blanket, sour white grapes, underlying citrus peels, dry white wine, and a touch of wood and wine from the barrels. simply unbelievable what the wood and brett does to this one. mouth feel is smooth and light with just enough carbonation to push it across. flavor shows off the white grapes up against the sourness from the brett, oak lies in the background, light spices,  horse blanket, touch of citrus, and an almost creamy richness. this pulls the taste in so many directions, sweet, sour, and dry. finish goes dry with a lingering white grape and sour punch. this is so well balanced and drinkable. i have to admit i drank the first bottle of the four all to myself.","Connecticut, USA","blklab2007"
3129,"2008-07-26",4.4,"Bottle, Batch 2 fresh from the brewery. Aroma of sour green grapes, horseblanket funk (distinct yet relaxed and pleasant), liquoricy funk, lemon/pineapple. Flavor definitely retains those tart grapes and has some interesting tart herbal qualities. Unbelievably drinkable, fairly laid back carbonation after the pour, little to no vinegary aspects, clean finish. An absolute pleasure.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
3129,"2008-07-26",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2008 Bought four bottles at the brewery today! Pours a translucent yellow/cream colour with a wispy white head that leaves minimal lacing. The nose ruminates from the glass, leding to impressions of horseblanket, sharp citrus, sour white grapes, ultra-funky Brettanomyces, wood and acetic acid. The flavour is sharp, tart and funky, with some residual bitterness in the finish. Notes of lemon, barnyard funk, tart grapes, cardamom? and loads of Brett yeast. The sourness is less harsh than the Cantillion classic Gueuze, making it far more drinkable than many Belgian examples. There is a creaminess to the palate, which nicely counters the sharp, sour flavours. It is softly, yet amply carbonated. Another magnificent brew from a great brewery.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Drink4Satan"

3129,"2008-06-12",4.8,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2011 Bottle sampled at blind tiger with BrianK.  This was the first time that i truely enjoyed drinking a sour ale.  A light yellow with darker hues and a light head.  Aroma is sour grapes, oak, acidity in your nostrals, light fruit lemony citrus.  Has a dry mouth puckering sourness that is reminicent of apples and grapes, woodiness in the flavor helps to balance this one out.  A very enjoyable sour, i cant wait to have batch 2.  4.3

3129,"2008-06-04",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 25, 2008 Batch 1:
Bright yellow color with quickly receding white head, little lacing.  Aroma has lemon, oak, somewhat acidic, pineapple, and some chardonnay.  Taste is quite acidic, but full of interesting flavors like oak, lemon, hay, chardonnay, and pineapple.  Very dry and light on the palate with fairly high carbonation.  A very, very good sour.


Batch 2:  Yellow with a white head that dissipates fairly quickly, leaving no lacing.  Oak in the aroma, along with some lemon and other citrus aromas.  Not very intense, rather delicate, but interesting and well done.  White wine taste, lemon tartness, oak, peaches, and maybe a hint of apricot.  Medium carbonation and light body, finish is fairly dry.  Not nearly as sour as the first batch, but it has nice flavors and is still a nice sour.  4 - 9 - 9 - 4 - 17 = 4.3","Iowa, USA","badbeer"

3129,"2008-05-07",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2013 750mL Bottle. Batch Number 1. Wildly complex nose. Lavender and pink peppercorns immediately come to mind. Dry oak is definitely present. Somehow Im transported to the Sycamore canyons of southeastern Arizona. Musky and fruity. Complex and unique. The beer pours a raging, lightly hazed golden. Prickling with carbonation and producing a white head that behaves weirdly. It holds at first and then subsides quickly into the beer, leaving nothing behind. Clean. At first, Im mulling on these flavors and wondering why this is so highly regarded. Is my palate missing the boat here? I give it time. I mean, its a vibrant, brightly flavored fruity dry beer, with unique character and nice acids. The grapes are what really end up doing it. There is certain white grape fruit juice, but its more refined. In a white port kind of way. A bit of apple juice takes me to the vineyards of Switzerland and I imagine the sun is warming my face. This is a really interesting beer. Lightly sweet, with apple juice and white grape character, showing an oaked finished and very clean acids. Mature and refined. I would never expect a beer to really behave this way, like wine. And maybe thats why Im struggling with it a little. This may have crossed the line for me a little bit. My second pour from the bottle is insanely cloudy. The first was brilliantly clear. The carbonation must have brought a lot of yeast up. The beer develops some more softness, light spice and general fruitiness. White figs play a role at this point. This beer is refreshing and delicious. Theres a harder-to-describe vibrant fruitiness riding over the top of this beer that I cant quite latch on to. Okay, this beer is awesome. The bright, fresh acids, the balanced sweetness, the oak, the finish in complex, spicy fruits, and the carbonation. I just dont want to put the glass down, its too good. Dry. Its not so much that any single element of this beer is ragingly amazing or unique, but that the beer as a whole is rather perfect and delightful. The grapes certainly give it panache, but the real excellent here is in how clean and fresh the acids blend with the beer. Nice job Scott. More: Im not giving this beer enough credit. It really is pretty phenomenal. One reason is that the barrel influence is perfect and thats hard to accomplish. Also, the flavors are just sustaining, like nothing else. This is world class.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Heavenly aroma. Tart, fruity and funky all at once. The brett is beautiful. Pineapple, white grape skin, new oak. Absolutely intoxicating aroma. Pours a bright, cloudy yellow with a thin ring of a white head. Loads of bretty tartness on the palate. Quite crisp and refreshing. Almost gueuze-like in its funk, but not as intense. Lemon zest, lots and lots of white grape skin, oak tannin... theres enough of a malty base, though that holds down the funk. Lively and vibrant on the tongue. Mildly tart and acidic finish with some lemon zest sourness that lasts forever... Insanely drinkable for how massively complex this beer is. Top notch and superb all the way! Thank you ever so much for your wonderful generosity Ken!
Re-rate. 10/11/08 Everything about this beer is magical and transcendent. Its radiant and glowing color. The beautifully tart, funky and insanely complex aroma. The taste sends goosebumbs up and down my spine. Wickedly complex and utterly drinkable. Everything... malt, yeast, hops, barrel... is in perfect harmony. Ripe and prickly mouth feel with a finish that goes on forever. I cant see how beer can possibly get better than this. A true experience for the senses. Truly a masterpiece. 
March 09 batch 2. Less acidic. Less barrel and a much flabbier and less snappy body. Lacks the vibrancy of batch 1 and other batch 2s. Hmmm...
May 09 batch 2. The last 2 bottles Ive opened have been a bit ""off"" but this last one is back... spot on! Amazing acidity and seems to be drying out quite a bit. Full mouthfeel and a wonderfully lengthy finish. Cant wait for batch three!
Another Batch 2 May 09. Out of a cardboard cup in Northern Minnesota while camping with the family. Still insanely delicious. Getting more and more tart the longer the bottles age. 

 Unfortunately, have to dock it .1 because some (not all, and not that many) of the batch 3 and batch 4s have been a ***bit*** off. Slightly flabby mouthfeel, musty nose and lacking the amazing zestiness and crispness of ""on"" bottles. Still amazing, but consistent bottles are a must for a perfect 5.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"

3129,"2008-02-12",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 2, 2009 Original rating: Bottle from jjpm74, a very generous dude. The pour was hazy golden in color, head initially pretty spritzy, gushing, quickly diminishing to a thin head to nothing. Aroma is super aromatic, smelled far away from the bottle, in the glass though a nice blend of grapes, sour citrus, and wood notes. Funk and horse blankets pretty soft, though. The flavor was muscrat grapes with lemon tartness, bret notes, finishing with a yeasty bready malt support that was pretty phenomenal. I love the malt support in these sours, and this didnt take the amber to brown track, but sure was enjoyable. Mouthfeel was spritzy, pretty drinkable within style.

3129,"2007-11-27",4.1,"Cloudy, opaque golden pour covered by a quickly departing white foam. That was an original and most interesting ale in the mold of Petrus aged pale. It attacks straight on with pungent lemon and attenuated fruit acids. Sharp and vibrant acidity feels vinous enough, but the woodiness remains understated. I could not find it a particularly complex or deep profile, its yeast remains too easy-going while its sourness is strong enough to overwhelm some of its layers + the finish is pure citric acid, astringent and perhaps not as sustained as some. Extraordinary, this is granted, but the suppleness might yet be improved in the rough finish as the introduction  a sugary, fleshy, nuanced botrytis-like nose was glorious. I certainly do love how the sweetness and acidity rely on each other, up until the very end when the sweetness has given up  especially under that rather hard regimen imposed by the intense carbonation.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

How: Montreal-crew sour beer tasting session.  Bottle that I acquired in person from Dickinsonbeer (a million thanks from me and the Montreal crew Paul !!), first batch, 6 months old
The look: cloudy dark yellow body with almost no head
In long: Nose is complex and intense with funky tropical fruits and strong acidic notes.  The funky character of this one is quite something.  No really bretty-like funky, not really lambic-like funky, but somewhere between the two.  Needless to say this is one for the wild beers lovers.  Fruity flavours include lemons, grapefruit and peach but no grapes although it is the one fruit used to make the beer.  No barrel/woody flavour either.  Magic happened with those grapes inside those barrels and end-result is intensely acidic/sour/tart yet highly drinkable in large quantities.  Oh man!

Lemonade colored with just about no head, it turned a bit more orangey and opaque when I got a refill.

Lavander and litchi fruit, the kind you usually find in a nice dessert white wine - Ive seen it in ice cider as well - but with a interesting horseblanket backdrop that is just enough to please lambic lovers without scaring off those who dont.

Fabulously intense acidity, almost lime-like with a bit of mandarine oranges. The carbonation levels and flavor reminds me of Federweisser, a partially fermented white wine served in the Franconian region. Lots of lemon rind twang that dries up the back of your tongue.

3129,"2007-11-18",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2011 My Bottom Line:
Tropical fruit flourish from the salient sourness of this expertly-crafted and compelling Sour Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam surrounds the cloudy blond.
-The very complex fruitiness develops pineapples, litchis, green apples, and the white grape character is delicate.
-The soft prickliness and perfectly-sculpted body make for a smashing mouthfeel.
-The tartness is lengthy and gripping, yet doesnt exaggerate.
-The white grape character is not as obvious in this one as it is in Russian Rivers Depuration, but this Castleton seemed more harmonious throughout and was simply more enticing.
-Brettanomyces anomalus (and/or clausenii) seems to have been used to embolden the tropical fruitiness. In any case, the flavor profile is entirely harmonious. Bravo!

3129,"2007-10-09",4.7,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2008 From a 750mL Bottle.  Rating based on a combination of multiple tastings.  Pours a slightly hazy, pale golden color with a small, but firm bubbled head of brilliant white.  Amazing brett aroma, dripping with tropical fruits, heavy on the papaya, but also has some more lightly acidic citric pineapple brett notes as well.  Some spicy pink grapefruit flesh adds a citric acid dimension that smells incredibly like freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, full of acidity, but lacking any of the pithy bitterness that accompany hop-induced grapefruit aromatics.  Theres a subtle earthy, woody note that comes through in the nose, but it comes across as nutty papaya seeds when intertwined with the brett.  Light bodied, moderately acidic, mildly effervescent mouthfeel.  The initial burst of crisp acidity is actually a bit of a surprise after smelling the less-acidic-dimensioned brett.  Almost seems borderline lactic at first.  The palate is nice and dry, but loaded with more tropical fruit brett notes that interplay nicely with the underlying grape quality.  The muscat grapes are thankfully held in check, laying low in the background in flavor and sweetness, allowing the wonderful brett flavors to work their magic.  Extended, dry and bretty finish, bringing out a bit more musty characters and a bit less of the acidity and fruit notes found on the front of the palate.  Exceptionally unique, especially in the pleasing amount of citric acid that comes through on the palate, creating a unique, complex, and refreshing taste experience.  I find this beer to be wonderful in every sense.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Pours hazy yellow with no head. Slight apple and acidic/citric aroma. Light to medium bodied. Flavour is sour with a minor sweetness lurking through. Not really wellbalanced.

3129,"2007-08-28",4.0,"25 oz bottle, via puzzl.  Pours a very cloudy yellowish orange body with a very fizzy bright white head.  Kinda reminds me of a mamosa with the champagne like carbonation visible.  The nose is tart apples and fruitiness with an undercurrent of brett and sweet-tarts.  Not quite a Flemish Sour, not quite a Gueuze.  Lemon rind, apricot, raw oak, and a little grapefruit.  The flavor is as sharp as a razor, with biting acidic lemons and lime zest.  Kinda reminds me of taking a shot of tequila with the salt and lemon.  Brett derived funk and musty finish is reminiscent of a gueuze.  I dont get too much oak, but there is some mid swallow before the finish washes it away.  The muscat grapes leave their presence known as well.  Theres alot going on here that you can pick out as specifics, but the real beauty is how they all meld together, that is much harder to describe.  Mouthfeel is pretty full despite the obvious high level of attenuation.  Even though its tart, acidic, and dry, theres a stickiness that makes the acidity linger in the mouth.  While the carbonation was very fizzy and prickly at first, it really blew off alot of it as it sat, maybe compounded by the Duvel glass?  Overall, quite an odd result to this experiment.  I gotta say that I like it, but i dont all-out love it.  Very glad to have the chance to try it though, and Id gladly try anything else from these guys.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Delivers the flavor nicely in a very complimentary way - more sour grape, grapefruit, lemon zest, a touch of yeastiness, and just enough sweet and sour to make it work well together.

This beer has a wonderful aroma full of grapes, lemony citrus, and even some zestiness and spice.  All of which meld very well with the oak and wine nose that comes through...and then all kicked in the face with the brett aroma that makes its presence very well known but all the while very welcome and enjoyable in the beer.  The flavors of this beer are where the beer somewhat falls short...it is still good but no where near what I was expecting after falling in love with the aroma of this beer.  The flavor is a nice sweet and sour mix of lemon mixed with a nice dryness from the wine oak barrel.  And while it is nice it is somewhat one dimensional and doesnt see much change throughout the beer, and there is just not as much complexity as I was hoping for.

3129,"2007-07-20",4.2,"Batch Number 1, Sampled July 2007
Topped by a large bubbled, pale, white froth, that starts out about a finger and a half in height, but disappears fairly quickly to a thin, not quite layer of froth.  The beer is deeply hazy, despite having rested in my fridge for a month, and is an orange-tinged, straw color.  The aroma is distinctively funky, with notes of uriatic acid, bitter mushrooms, musty-tea-infused damp leather and a distinct nutty note.  The nutty note comes on towards the end and reminds me of a woody mix of almonds and Brazil nuts.  An acidity / tartness reminiscent of a funky Sauvignon Blanc makes me wonder if this is contributed by the yeast or by the Muscat grapes.  The nutty note, while distinct at times, is at other times overwhelmed by the Brett aromatics.  I think that nuttiness may ultimately be some woody / spicy oak character coming through.

A prickly carbonation, which despite its bountiful presence, is probably at a medium level of carbonation.  Somehow, despite being quite dry seeming, this beer has a medium fullness to it; the body of this brew somehow sticks to the mouth, yet never seems sweet, or even remotely cloying.  Perhaps it is best described as being a light beer with a viscous quality to it that allows the beer to cling to the palate.  Tart, with lots of green grape notes; slightly herbal, yet with hints of kiwi, a touch of lime (the mix is something like star-fruit actually), and some green apple notes as well.  A backdrop of funky Brett character finishes the flavor profile of this beer off; musty cotton balls, moldy leather, and sharp, mushroom-like fungal character are among the Brett contributed notes.  As my palate gets used to the first few sips, a soft, green-fruit sweetness becomes noticeable; this helps to accentuate the fruit notes previously mentioned as well as accenting some notes of apricot.  Hints of oak character around the edges combine with some of the fruit notes to evoke thoughts of nutty apricot pits.

The apricot notes and thus the sweetness become more noticeable as I work my way through this bottle; the sweetness never becomes overt though.  The aroma also pick ups some dry, toasty grain notes that are reminiscent of biscuits & soda crackers.

The oak character in this beer is absolutely stunning; I dont think I have ever had a beer that got the oak character so perfectly.  It is not intrusive, nor is it even overtly noticeable, but it adds another layer of flavor to this beer that is an integral part of this complexly compelling brew.  I also find it quite interesting how the grapes have added a sort of viscous quality to this brew without making it overtly sweet.  A definitely interesting brew, in fact it is the best marriage of white grape and beer I have had yet.  The best thing about this beer  I get to go pour myself another glass right now!","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Very nice, very complex.  Has nice characteristics of a tart and funky beer but the grape and wine characteristics make it unique  and I dont even like wine that much.  Thin, tart, acidic taste and body.  Complex and flavorful but easy to drink.  This one was a beauty.  Cant think of any flaws.  Certainly worth the hype.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

3129,"2007-07-17",4.1,"Courtesy of Boboski. The aroma is incredibly intense and concentrated and features a sour lambic like note with hints of oak,  grapefruits and what I can only describe is pickled baby chinese baby corn. It smells very Belgian and lambic like (not Flemish Sour, but funky real Lambic). The body is an opaque yellow/orange and the head settles quickly to the point that the beer is basically headless. It looks like a glass of grapefruit, which works with the very grapefruity aroma. The first sip reminds me of pickled chinese baby corn. Grapefruit, mega sour with a palate reseeting tart twang.  Very juicy with fresh citrus notes at time, but still quite lambicesque in flavor. I cant believe this was made in America. Amazing.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"

I almost want to say that its salty as well.   Lightly puckery citric acid sourness.

3129,"2007-07-04",4.8,"UPDATED: JAN 13, 2008 New rating, Jan 13, 2008: Had a bottle last night (after having the beer first in June, I think), next to to other muscat grape beers, blind to which was which (a newer Vigneronne and a DFH Midas Touch). The Castleton was a virtual volcano, seethingly, weirdly luminescent; just a thick bubbling, organic and volatile example of a beer.

The sheer amount of bugs in this beer is incredible - it ups Mo Betta Bretta by several notches in the stringy, pineapple Brett department. The huge grape/peach fruitiness is still there (in my opinion, contrary to recent reports of its demise) with earthy, funky Chardonnay notes, and the beer is just jam packed with ingredients. Grapefruit finish as many have noted, but I just dont get the complaints of unidimensional sourness.

Mostly, though, the beer is just a different animal altogether. There are not many beers like it that I have encountered in the past six years, if any, really. I guess I can see a complaint that it is too ""engineered"" or something like that, a big science experiment, but I feel the exact opposite, that you dont know what it is going to show you. Phenomenal beer. I wondered last night what the GABF judges who were faced with this beer were thinking...
Original rating, 4.5, July 4th: In the Im Not Worthy pack from willblake. Let me just say I see what the fuss is about, and the only thing this beer needs to be absolutely perfect is time. Glowing golden, unbelievably intense in the orangey gold. Why, oh why, wasnt there a bunch of bottles made of this? Right now, this young, all the flavor components are separable - you have a ton of fruit, coming out here as ripe peaches and apricot (I wouldnt have guessed muscat grape if blind), intense but unidentifiable spice (perhaps a bit of the spiciness of grains of paradise) and serious brett stank - and I mean stank. Barnyard stank. You drink it and it comes together in your mouth. It is a bit sweet and fruitier than I supposed but yet totally natural, and not fatiguing. If this beer could settle in the cellar for a year and get all melded together it would be among the finest beers I have ever had. Aroma curls your nostrils with the fresh hay, spice and peach, and diaper. Again, wow, and huge thanks to Jon.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"

3129,"2007-06-25",4.7,"UPDATED: AUG 3, 2008 Batch 2.  Pale golden straw coloured brew with a fast-fading white head.  Aroma is just lovely.  Rich soft lactic tartness.  A bit of lemony citrus as well.  As the nose adjusts to this, you begin to notice all of the more subtle characteristics going on in back.  Rich and softly tart with a nice malic white grape tartness as well.  Soft fruitiness over a soft pilsner malt base that is still perceptible.  The pineapple character that was so prominent in last years version is nowhere near as pronounced here.  There is also a soft rich vanilla oakiness that adds yet another layer of complexity.  Flavour is rich with perhaps a perfect balance of tartness and soft wild funkiness.  White grapes, pink grapefruit, oak, white pepper and a soft lactic tartness that wraps in all up in thirst-quenching goodness.  Truly a world-class brew.  A softly lingering cooling spearminty character.  Last years brew was so new and different from anything else that I think that accounted for a great deal of the high ratings (mine included)... this one is one of the best beers Ive ever tasted.  I hope this is a prelude to the Rosso coming out this winter... cant wait for more stuff from these guys. 

Batch 1.  Thanks to beastiefan2k for breaking this one out.  Very pale cloudy beer, light yellow with a thick white head.  Aroma is incredibly bright and fresh with loads of lactic/malic acid, tart fruit, pineapple and a hint of white grapiness.  White pepper and loads of tart acidity.  Very complex nose, with lots of wildness and a suggestion of brett as well.  Warming gives a cooling spearmint flavour that is quite interesting as well.  Wheaty and not unlike a very sour Berliner weisse.  Tart apple, pineapple and pear flavours that back the tart bacterial sourness.  Warming intensifies the sourness and the complexity... this stuff is world class and I cant wait to try it with another year on it

3129,"2007-06-25",4.8,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2007 The only real disappointment with my trip to Captain Lawrence was the fact that they were out of this wonderful, yet very rare beer.  Supposedly this wasnt even distributed - only available at the brewery and ""accidentally"" sent to Lazy Boy in White Plains.  So I made the trip, and despite having to consume on premises, I managed to get one of the last available bottles.  The appearance is a yellowish-fizzy color (poured into a Duvel glass).  The aroma is captivating - A wonderful sour-tart mix of grape, lemon, lime, Brett - one of the best smelling beers ever.  The taste has lots of tart citrus upfront, but mellows and goes down quite smoothly - citrus, sour/sugary flavors, wood, and Brett dominate this bad boy.  Wonderful mouthfeel.  Truly an experience - maybe Ill be able to snag another one someday...........7/2/07 - Whaddayaknow  - I end up in NYC at Blind Tiger and manage to find another bottle.  Still amazing, what a beer.

3129,"2007-06-24",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 30, 2007 Thanks Andrew (hophead75) for getting this for me from the brewery.  750ml bottle with a mangled label.  Pours lemon juice yellow, such a light colored beer with absolutely no clarity in it.  Full of yellow light but cannot see through it at all.  Aroma was strong of bretty lemon juice for me.  Smelled like lemon musk.  Taste was cazy acidic and full of lemon brett.  Think lemon juice, add white grapes with a mix of brett.  It should have been called lemonade brett.  Light and refreshing overall.  Spritzy, spiky mouthfeel, tickling my cheeks. Very dry and acidic finish. Update: was able to sample again, bottle at Blind Tiger.  Despite my state at the tijme of the above rating, my notes were actually spot on.  I wanted to add that when you get your snooze in there and really take it in there is also a cherry aroma that comes off of fresh brett.  Also definite grapefruit juice flavors.

3129,"2007-06-24",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 1, 2008 Batch 2 - this batch is much more balanced, refined, and subtle than the first - the aroma is quite sour up front, but deeper whiffs reveal the muscat grapes in all their glory, with lovely, soft oak behind it, and subtle herbs - the flavor progresses in much the some way - quite tart and acidic up fron, but once this washes away, the oak comes through strong, but not overpowering, smoothing out the other elements of the beer and pulling them together - this oak quality works really well with the muscat grape flavor that swells up behind it, adding a wonderful, tannic, white wine dimension - but wait, there’s more - there are some herbs coming up from underneath that - thyme, saffron, jasmine - man, now THIS is what I was hoping the first batch would be like! - (batch 1 rating, 3.5)[had this a second time at Blind Tiger, again, thanks to Eugene - I must say after having more of this I really dont get the super-high ratings - there is a huge lemon presence, at times making the beer taste very much like lemonade - the sourness seems to lack the earthy complexities usually associated with wild yeast - quite acidic on the back end - I know all the locals will crucify me for this, but I have to go against the grain on this one] Thanks to beastiefan2k for sharing - very cloudy yellow pour, with fizzy head/carbonation, and a few flecks of chunky sediment floating around - huge lemon, brett, and bacteria aroma, with a very lactic, berliner weisse-like presence (as dickinsonbeer points out), peppery notes - very dry, but with a refreshing tartness - pear, apple and grape skins take a back seat to the sourness and well-developed brett funk (which will probably be huge with a little aging) - mild white pepper spice, pineapple and lemon verbena round things out - while I cant call this beer an earth-shattering drinking experience, I do love what this brewer is doing.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

3129,"2007-06-14",4.1,"Batch 1. Extra point and esteem held for a very interesting appearance. Looks just like spritzy, white grapefruit juice. Very cloudy body and a fully diminishing and extremely short-lived white head. Grassy notes are a soft prelude to a smashing onslaught of grape juice and oaken barrels that amalgamate to simulate a grapefruit juice component that is heady, though far more pleasant and diverse in complexities than the real juice is. Notes of vanilla and acidic lemon rinds creep forward as if pushed from behind. This sample is very fresh and the Brettanomyces has yet to become forceful. Flowery noble hops emerge as the sample warms to near room temperature. Spicy acidity bites at the senses. On a night of sampling much greater than average beers, this aroma is unique enough to ingrain itself into my sensory memory for years to come. The flavor is intoxicating long before alcohol takes its standard hold upon my palate and mindset. Sweetness is held in check by the brett looming in the shadows, as well as the tannic vanilla bean touches. The finish is very acidic and mostly lemony, with oak notes and vanilla and grape lingering for a great while. Carbonation is spritzy and well integrated into the whole experience. The mouthfeel is sugggestive of a Mimosa: spritzy carbonation angrily mingling with pulpy juices. Palate is light bodied, syrupy at times but mostly lively and refreshing, very tart. This definitely doesnt fit into any traditional style category....just one more reason to love it. Captain Lawrence does it again. An awesome experience.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
3129,"2007-06-13",4.1,"750mL bottle, batch 1; many thanks to Scott for this one!  The carbonation on this is a bit nuts: I spent the last few minutes covering the top of the bottle while trying to wash out a tulip glass with one hand.  Very fizzy pour, with carbonation reminiscent of pouring a soda: fizzy, effervescent, and quickly gone, leaving a cloudy, dull golden color without any sign of head: almost like grapefruit juice.  Everything afterwards is exquisite.  Dense, layered aroma, showing some brett and funk and sour cherries and grapefruit; mouthwatering tartness, with a pleasant citrus and fruity core.  Average carbonation.  Generous mouthfeel: dense, jaw-poking tartness at the forefront, with plenty of lively citrus and grapefruit and cherries; excellent density of fruit, with some tropical stuff in there as well: pineapple and passion fruit; some toasty vanilla and buttery notes find their way in from the barrel, along with the wonderful, generous fruit profile.  Lengthy, tart citrus and light oak finish.  Definitely an interesting take on the style: less cherries than usual, with a lively citrus spritziness and a pleasant tropical fruit twist, and an effervescence suggesting Champagne.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

Some wood hints emerge after a few minutes.  Tastes very tarte with lipsmacking sourness.  Palate is tarte with the finish slightly bitter.  One of CLs best beers to date!","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
3129,"2007-05-20",4.5,"Bottle from the brewery.  Very hazy golden in appearance with a medium off white head.  Aroma is awesome, tons of grape, brett, funky, oaky, with alot of fruit, citrus, lemon, pineapple are just some that come to mind.  Taste, is alot of tart fruit right off the bat as well as soft oak.  Lemon, mango, white grapes, with just the right amount of sweetness to compliment the harsh (but pleasant) sourness.  Some musty yeast makes an appearance in the taste as well.  Finshes mouth puckeringly tart.  A unique, and downright amazing creation from Scott Vacarro.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
3129,"2007-05-20",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 2, 2007 Bottle shared with jjpm and IMtheOptimator, provided by... me! Second sample of this beer, actually. Very pale yellow pour, with a wit like appearance, and still having little bits of grape floating around. Awesome. Pineapple lemon funk aroma, acidic, lactic acid, a touch of fruit juice sweetness. The fruit really comes out in the flavor, though, with a perfect residual sweetness to compliment the big tartness. Pineapple, guava, white grape. Sourness really shows in the finish, with the fruit undertones carrying it through. Very unique in its blend of sweet and sour, and an absolute pleasure to drink. Very well done beer!","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
3129,"2007-05-20",4.3,"Bottle shared with jjpm74 and puzzl.  Poured a pale golden with a fizzy white head.  Aroma of pineapple, pine needles, lemony citrus, some woodiness... very unusual.  I smelled this beer for a good two or three minutes before I took my first sip.  Flavor does not disappoint from the aroma.  Pineapple juice, lemon, white wine, and grassy and piney hops all come through with a good degree of tartness that hits the back of your throat.  Wow.  Really, really unique and delicious.  One of the most innovative and tasty beers Ive had in a long time, and Im still getting over the fact that it came from a brewer I had previously considered overrated.  I guess I take it back.  These guys know what theyre doing.  Awesome stuff, and so incredibly drinkable I could have finished the whole 750 by myself, but Im glad I saved room for the beers to come...","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"
3129,"2007-05-10",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 21, 2008 Bottle Batch 1 attained at the brewery: Pours a bright yellowish golden, very cloudy in appearance and is topped by a thin white head that becomes a ring. The aroma is very rich and fruity. Has evident brett, muscat grapes, lots a vinous qualities, bright citrus notes, oak, white pepper like spiciness. Nice and complex. The flavor is no let down, this stuff is deliciously complex! Has an initial tartness on the tongue. A bright & fresh acidity with lots of vinous qualities. The sweet muscat grape flavors mesh perfectly with the tart lemon citruses and acidity. Rich citrus depth has some evident brett flavors, musty oak and residual spices like white pepper, (juniper or sage?), and maybe a coriander note in there as well. Theres also a fresh yeast bite in the body. The finish is clean, fruity and dryish. An amazing Belgian Ale with subtle complexities and a refreshing tartness. Scott is a genius.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"
