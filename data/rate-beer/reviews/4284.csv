4284,"2017-01-16",3.5,"33cl MHD08/2017, Maruhn. - Clearly the stellar brew of the newfangled trilogy. Fluffy eggwhite pour, natural soapy foam bubbles. Immensely aromatic and sweetly perfumed, mostly sweet lychee, canned in sweet syrup along with its peel. Sustains that lychee exotics in flavours, adding some canned gooseberry and sweet white grape: putting the ?Citra to work really well. Almost reminiscent of fruit whey, exotic Fruchtmolke sans the lacto tang. Body, bubbles and ABV at the service of that single perfume mission. Very light and summery, drinks like a natural mix. This should have been branded their Super Lager. - Paired with: spicy 3-cup chicken - too delicate for that. Thai basil is an IPA or brown ale fiend?","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"
