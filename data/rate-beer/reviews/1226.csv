1226,"2014-12-15",5.0,"Without a doubt, my favorite beer of all time. Its hard to get, as Capital only offers it around August and September of each year. Fortunately, Im only about 50 miles away from the brewery, so I can usually find it during that period. I love beers that set the mood for the season. This one certainly does that. Im not sure what it is, but sitting around a campfire with a few of these as the leaves are starting to fall in autumn is what life is all about. Its a big beer. If you plan on drinking quite a few of them, make sure you have a ""designated carrier"" that can drag you into the tent or camper at the end of the session. And try not to fall into the campfire.","","jeffkendall"

1226,"2014-10-29",4.2,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2012 vintage bottling. Pours slightly hazy deep reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, raisin, plum, fig, date, brown sugar, light nuttiness, light chocolate, slight tobacco/leather and yeast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark fruit and dark/bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, raisin, plum, fig, date, brown sugar, light nuttiness, light chocolate, slight leather/tobacco, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, raisin, plum, fig, date, brown sugar, light nuttiness/chocolate, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of big dark fruit and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/dark fruit balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and slightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome doppelbock style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of big dark fruit and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
1226,"2014-10-21",4.4,"12 oz bottle, poured into a bell glass at approximately 40 degrees F.

A: Pours a honey-gold that is not unlike the color of fresh synthetic motor oil, and settles into the glass as a beautifully clear light amber. I half expected to see some sort of mosquito trapped within the beer, waiting to for us to unlock the genetic secrets of the velociraptor from within it. It formed a decently thick head of perhaps a finger and a half, which quickly died away in a rush of fizzy sounds to leave only a slight white ring around the edges of the glass. No lacing was left to speak of. Bubbles rise steadily from the bottom of the glass the entire time it sits in said glass.

S: Sweet and yeasty, the nose is not unlike glazed bread, reminiscent of some sort of honeyed doughnut. Theres some hints of cherry and I daresay banana faintly in the nose as well.

T: Definitely a sweet beer, with caramel and honey bun flavors striking right out of the gate. A yeastiness makes itself known as the beer moves across the tongue, and the sweetness fades a little to let some cherry and cinnamon in along the sides. This beer finishes with a burst of cherry and raisin, and some faint hints of wood, beneath the last of the honey bun sweetness.

M: Smooth and creamy, this beer drinks like a runny syrup, clinging to the teeth and tongue well after the swallow. Its almost full enough to warrant a ""chewy"" descriptor, but not quite.

O: As a raging malt addict, I am a fan of this beer. The blend of doppelbock and Oktoberfest works well to create a full-flavored, complex profile that is refreshingly devoid of any noticeable hop presence. I see myself picking this up annually during trips to Chitown, and enjoying it every time.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

1226,"2014-10-04",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 5, 2014 12 oz bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. The aroma is initially play-doh like, followed by some cookie dough qualities. After this, a strong jolly rancher note comes through with secondary notes of caramel, vanilla beans, peanuts, and cooked sugar. It pours an effervescent, clear oily orange-yellow (a bit more on the orange side than yellow) with an off-white, dense and creamy head. The head reduces down to a thin ring, with a silky and filmy surface that eventually becomes oily, and it leaves behind an above average amount of dense, snowdrift lace. The taste is a medium bitter and sweet, leaning a bit towards the bitter side. The medium-full malt bodied beer has a creamy texture with a light, soda-like carbonation. Toasted nuts and caramel are the initial flavors picked up, with a slightly burnt or overly-roasted quality. It finishes a touch dry, but clean, with pine, spice, and bread crust and it leaves behind a roasted nut and slight bitter citrus (lime and grapefruit) aftertaste.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

1226,"2014-02-20",3.1,"20-Feb-14 (12-oz bottle)This beer pours a hazy, medium-brown body with a thin, light-tan head that dissipates quickly. The nose is sweet and caramely with dried fruits, some tropical, almost banana-like fruitiness, and brown sugar, but it lacks the classic toasty, melanoidin character of German examples. Its sweet, very malty, and caramely on the palate, a lot more emphasis on the sugary and malty side with less fruitiness than the aroma shows, but again, whats missing is that German melanoidin character that domestic Doppelbocks just cant seem to nail. Its medium-plus in weight, sweet but not to the point of being cloying, light-medium in carbonation, and pretty smooth on the palate. Overall, this is a fine domestic Doppelbock, deliciously malty, but falls short of excellence when compared to its German counterparts.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Appearance: The body is crystal clear with an amber to copper hue, accompanied by a dense light tan head that sticks around for a bit.
Aroma: The aroma is how I like my doppelbocks, mildly fruity with big malts. I get a lot of sticky caramel and brown sugar with a fig fruitiness. The aroma is sweet and pleasant with good strength.
Taste: The flavor matches the aroma. The intro is big sweet malts that run through, becoming bigger by the finish. The finish becomes a blend of raisins and caramel, very enjoyable. The finish is quick though leaving a raisin and caramel afterthought.
Palate: Full-bodied, a sticky feel to it, with mild carbonation.
Overall: This is a good doppelbock, I have no complaints about it. The only reason Im not enamored with this is that I feel Troegenator is ultimately a better beer.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

1226,"2013-05-17",4.3,"Capital Autumnal Fire, aged 3 years 7 months in my beer cellar, 7.8% ABV
A 12oz bottle and poured into a Capital Brewery Snifter.
Appearance: Poured ruby brown with a very little head and lacing.
Smell:  Toasted malt and caramel notes, no pronounced hop presence, no obvious off flavors.
Taste:  Dried fruit and cognac sweetness.  A molasses finish lingers.  There is also a slight aftertaste of old leather, but not unpleasant.
Mouth feel:  Medium body and low carbonation, coating the back of the tongue and upper palette with black licorice.  Also a nice warming alcohol finish.
Overall: Capital was the first American craft breweries to combine the Oktoberfest and Doppelbock styles into one amazingly drinkable strong beer.  The cellar aging has brought forward the more bitter flavors to balance with strong sweetness of the young beer.  This is a great cognac-like after diner beverage to enjoy by an open fire with a maduro leaf cigar.","Illinois, USA","YoDude"

5. Evaluate - Overall, this is a quality beer that has an initial sweet malty flavor with a dry metallic finish and loaded with alcohol.  Give it a try and eat with a bratwurst.","Palos Park, Illinois, USA","pjwalsh2"

Aroma: Its got that smell which seems to be held in common amongst lagers; its not a very strong smell and, to tell the truth, its kind of hard to define.

Appearance: The pour is clear and moderately deep amber. The head on top of the pour is a very thin off white color.

Taste: Similar to the smell comments that Ive made, theres that lingering taste which runs across many lager styles (which is hard for me to define). The malty flavors are strong in this one, with just a tiny amount of hoppy bite. Its got a bit of a flush of sweetness (not too strong, mind you) on the aftertaste, which is nice.

Palate: Very smooth on the palate with a moderate to moderatly thick body to it. Theres also a noticeable amount of carbonation going on here.

Overall: For some reason, I want to describe this beer with the word ""warm"". A thick and hearty doppelbock which I wont mind going after again.","Wisconsin, USA","AbsoluterZero"

1226,"2010-12-09",3.7,"From a 12oz Bottle.  Pours a transparent, ruddy copper colored body with a thin finger of off-white foam.  Malty, melanoidin rich aroma of raisins and toast.  Honey and grape.  Mild alcohol warmth, clean, and no hops noted.  Medium bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel with a chewy malt texture.  Rich malt flavors of toast, raisin, and light leather.  Light herbal hop bitterness in the finish, along with a moderate alcohol warmth that also adds some bitterness perception to balance the malt sweetness.  Rich malt sweetness, but well attenuated, ensuring adequate drinkability.  The commercial description of a beefed up oktoberfest is accurate, but conceptually doesnt work as well as blond doppelbocks or traditional darker doppelbocks for my palate.  I dont find the flavors to be any more complex than an oktoberfest, but the drinkability is decreased.  Regardless, its still a well made beer with an impressive malt flavor.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Moderate carbonation, with a creamy, chewy body that isnt as chalky as some Doppelbocks are. A slight warmth serves as a reminder about the alcohol.

Aromas of raisins, caramel, some alcohol, rather brandy-like.  Flavor comparatively muted.  Dark flavors, caramel, chocolate, very much there.  What could be a nice malt complexity, cider, raisins, fading towards plums, completes for attention with the alcohol and its residual warmth, and the beer suffers for this.

Doughy, and warm, with a fulsome, nutty malt character beneath the sugars and pitty fruits.  Almost wine-like with a temporanillo texture at times.  The right malts rightly balanced.

Flavor is chunky and deep.  Figs, raisins, brown sugar, molasses bread, and softly cooling spices.  Alcohol present and calm.  Malts staying quite bready, and there’s a slightly herbal touch of hops that lingers near the back, but the syrupy quality of the sweetness tends to whisk that away.  Dirty sugars of maple syrup, and unfortunately, corn, which seems woefully out of place amidst the rest of the malt flavors, which are genuinely well-formed.

Full palate; soft, and oily, even greasy, almost.  Finishes on candy sugar, vague fruits and some hickory wood barbecue tang.  Honey marinade, and sugar cookie dough.  For the most part the beer seems too blonde; while the malt structure seems so firm and polished, it hollows out a bit into sugar and lets the alcohol through too readily.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

1226,"2008-01-28",4.1,"The aroma on this brew is great. It has a strong malty scent. The great thing about the aroma on this beer is that it smells almost exactly like that smell that permeates the air as you walk up to any brewery.... with notes of caramel (respectively).

Pours with a generous white head that diminishes but for a small head that sticks around. 
Taste is fantastic. Very malty, just very lightly fruity some good cherry flavors, it is however predominantly dry with some bitterness on the sides of the tongue. This glass is served a little cold, so the alcohol does show itself; this is pleasant enough as it is in no way overpowering. However when served at room temperature (as I have in the past) the alcohol is very much hidden.

1226,"2007-10-06",3.8,"I am not the biggest fan of doppelbocks, and I found this one to be very enjoyable, which I would call high praise.  This beer had a very nice blend of malt character (not too much, as is frequently my opinion of this style), just a bit of cerealness, and a very pleasant mouthfeel.

It poured a rich caramel color with a thick tan head.  Aroma was malty, with a bit of caramel.  Flavor was pleasingly sweet, but not overwhelming, maltiness.  There was just a touch of cereal-ness, which is what I typically object to, but it was in a very nice moderation in this beer.  Mouthfeel was smooth, substantial, and good.

I would definitely recommend this ber.

Autumnal Fire poured a clear glowing caramel brown. A 2 finger khaki head formed on the pour quickly falling to 1 finger that lasts. A glassful of large carbonation bubbles rise to the head. Leaves patchy lacing.

The nose is complex but subtle. Big hint of banana bread off the bat which is definately appealing. Subtle caramel maltiness in the background. Doughiness combines nicely with the other aromas. Every now and then I get a slight metallic twang that doesnt detract from the beer.

Flavor is much the same as the aroma. Banana bread up front mixed with a mild but spicy alcohol that lingers in the back throughout. Caramel sweetness comes through mid palate with the alcohol getting spicier on the finish. Mild fumes rise through the nose. 

Good medium body with a rich texture. Velvety smooth with mellow carbonation. 

For such a high abv this beer is surprisingly drinkable. Enough sweetnees to mask the alcohol without becoming cloying.

Autumnal Fire is an excellent doppelbock from Capital. Enjoyable, easy drinking, and great flavor. The high point, without taking anything away from the flavor, is the mouthfeel.

cellar aged 1 year. wont adjust rating since Capital brews beer meant for consuming fresh. nose is mostly toffee and some cookie. flavor is very malty, toffee, toasted biscuit, and cookie finish. the hops have faded but those never played a big role in this beer. the malt seems to not be quite as robust as it is fresh which perhaps is why this doesnt seem as sweet. dont notice the alcohol either. this beer really hasnt changed much, i wouldnt say its better, but maybe not worse either. didnt notice any oxidized notes though. kinda curious to see it at 2 years but do i have one in the cellar? not sure...A solid doppelbock at a fair price!

Taste has a rich malt backing that is tough to pick up before it warms.  Sweet fruits and a nice tangy alcohol burn are present.  This is very different from other beers Ive tried, especially lagers.  This satisfies a barleywine-like craving.  My favorite D-Bock so far.","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"

Clear, light copper color with an ivory colored head.  Amoma is caramel, some hop bitterness, and a bit of dry alcohol.  Flavor is malt, deep caramel, and alcohol.  Medium body and smooth.

UPDATE (1/02/2007):  Today was a LONG day at work, so tonight is Doppelbock night!  The line up consists of Bells Consecrator Doppelbock, Capital Autumnal Fire, and Two Brothers Incinerator Blonde Doppelbock.  First up was the Bells.  Now its on to the Capital...

Ive been wanting to have some more of this great brew eer since I first had it at a beer tasting back in October 2006.  A friend that lives in the Chicago area was in Wisconsin on business and picked up a 6-pack for me.  Thanks!  -- 

Hazy amber color (on the darker end of the amber spectrum) with a modest tan head.  It has a yeasty aroma at first, but after the head falls more of the  underlying maltiness and some fruit and molasses characteristics become apparent.  The flavor is a bit cleaner than the Bells Consecrator and .  There is also a warming alcohol in the finish.  Rich malty flavor infused with other flavors including sugary caramel (reminds me a little bit of ""Sugar Daddy"" candy), roasted nuts, and some faint undeterminable fruitiness.  Overall this beer is on the sweeter side, but has a nice bitterness that brings everything into balance.  This Doppelbock is also thicker than average medium-bodied beer and goes down smoothly.  Overall I quite thoroughly enjoyed trying this beer again.  Now Im definitely looking forward to the other 5 bottles left in the pack!

Aroma is full of banana esthers, light hints of bubblegum, some cooked pear, and lots of rich caramel stirred into muffin batter.  Thick, viscous, even unctuous mouthfeel is a delight in all its alcoholic and malty warmth.  Not so subtle overtones of pear, golden raisin, pear nectar, and walnut.

Gorgeous brilliant ruby copper color -- one of the lovliest beers Ive laid eyes on. Medium white head forms on pour and a thin head sits on top until the liquid beneath it is gone. Huge sweet caramel malt nose. Big sweet caramel flavor as well with some alcohol showing, though not enough to betray its 8.5% ABV. Medium hop presence is almost overwhelmed by the complex malt. Mouthfeel almost thin for how intense this beer is. Thick, slightly cloying palate. The best American-made German beer Ive had yet. Consistently excellent year after year, on tap or in bottles.

Sweet malt flavor with hints of toffee and caramel. A lasting sweet flavor is left in your mouth. Very easy to drink, with the alcohol being hidden.","New Lenox, Illinois, USA","HopsOrDie"
1226,"2005-09-06",3.4,"An odd, stale aroma.  Sweet maltiness with a slight alcohol twang.  Fairly low ""warming"" quality for something dubbed as fire.  Thick and sweet, but not entirely great.  A good doppelbock, but not the best from the Capital stable.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","Gurst"
1226,"2005-08-31",3.8,"12 oz bottle.  When drinking this I had no idea of its 8.5%abv.  Alcohol is hidden very well behind all the malt.  Pours a deep amber, very clear with a nice thin lasting head.  Aroma is bready and very malty, lots of munich-like sweetness in the smell.  Flavor is also moderately sweet yet not cloying, loaded with malts and finished off with a bit of hops.  One of the brewers (Pat?) who gave me this beer said it was kind of a cross between a maerzen and a doppelbock.  I can see where the marzen comes in with the lighter red color, and more subdued big bready malts and some chocolate that straight up doppels have.  The mouthfeel was in the middle range making this very easy to drink- differentiating it from many doppels which can be almost too thick, sweet, and cloying to drink much of.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
1226,"2005-08-25",3.4,"GTM. Really bad aroma, macro lagerish. Dark, brownish orange with a large off-white head. Very beautiful beer. Malty flavor. Not sure what the buzz is about. Then again, this was something like beer #25 among the Midwests best beers. Something off in the flavor I really didnt enjoy. If this is Capitals best brew, I confirm my long time notion that either Capital is simply not that great a brewer or perhaps that their Germanocentrric products dont hit home with me.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
1226,"2005-08-15",3.8,"Sampled at the Great Taste of the Midwest, Madison, 8/13/2005. My wife opted for Octokberfest while I sampled Autumnal Fire, and I was surprised how similar they were to one another. This offers a nice dried cranberry and raisin profile, with a good viscosity on the palate. Great malt backbone gives it is caramel and butter notes. My favorite of the series is still the Blonde Doppelbock, but this is probably a close second for me. Having this spend some time on bourbon would make it exceptional.","Illinois, USA","Philip"

The bottom line is that this beer is unique -- try as I might I simply cannot discern aroma/flavor elements other than caramel malt and a touch of alcohol. A bit of hops in the finish.

Nose of deep caramel, mixed with the light floral notes you would expect in this style.  Pleasant, and Im not even a bit fan of bock beers in general.  Floral hop palate fades into a sweet caramel and molasses tinged finish, with a touch of honey.  Not totally my thing, but enjoyable.  I would think most fans of bock beers would be drooling over this one.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
1226,"2005-02-19",3.8,"Bottle. Thanks to joeybgood for another one! Pours a gorgeous copper with a small off white head. Light permeates this and it looks like an autumn sunset. Nose is very malty with light alcohol, ripe fruits, honey, and toffee. Smells very rich and very sweet. WOW! Taste is very fruity and sweet with toffee, brown sugar, light alcohol, honey, light spiciness, and syrup. Body is sticky and thick. Leaning towards being too syrupy but is still creamy and slick. Mild carbonation feel. Finish is more toffee, alcohol, honey and malts with light fruit. Indeed a snifter beer!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
1226,"2005-02-13",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 14, 2005 On tap at the brewery. They found a keg of this autumn release somewhere, and had it on tap. Dark amber, nearly brown in color. Very little head. Aromas of honey and caramel. It is very thick and syrupy, with coffee, caramel and toffee-style sweetness. There is some spicyness in the finish, although the syrupy sweetness overrides. A little over-sweet in my opinion, but very worth having a bottle or two.","Knoxville, Iowa, USA","Aureth"

I am now more impressed.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","ChrisPants"
1226,"2005-02-03",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2007 2004 bottle Huge thanks to Heemer77 for getting this one for me.  Had been wanting to try it for a long time.  Good auburn mixed with amber colored body on it, clear, with a small dark yellow/light tan head.  Fruity notes are given off, as is a thick, robust caramel malt.  Notes of alcohol are well intertwined with the sweetness, producing a fiery, rich smell.  Flavor is much the same, though perhaps even more sweet than the aroma had set me up for.  Sticky, coating caramel and toffee sweetness, with a light fruitiness in the background.  Light creamy maple fudge notes add to the sweetness.  Alcohol attempts to dry out the body, but dosent succeed in doing so.  Spicy notes mix with the candied sweetness on the end and the finish is relatively quick.  Medium body, with more flavor, sweetness, alcohol and hops than the body seems to support.  Not overly complex, but pretty tastey.  The Fish Tale Doppelbock later in the night would prove to be more complex.Aged bottle from Styles drunk in early March 07Not exactly sure how old, but it definitely shows no negative signs of aging.  Actually one of the best German beers Ive had and much better than the more fresh bottle I had.  I guess it couldnt be more than a 1.5 years old as it still poured a large head and was retained well.The flavor and mouthfeel were about as perfect as I can imagine for a doppelbock.  Delicious mix of light fruitiness, vanilla-cream maltiness, slight bits of toffee chewiness, moderate caramel and just a hint of spicy hops (earth, herbs, leafiness, clove) to give it a pinch of bitterness.  Sweetness is perfect.  Enough to give it a wonderful malty-creamy texture but not to the point of being cloying or inhibiting drinkability.  Even a bit of red fruitiness (red apples, berries, cherries) to add complexity.  Breadiness and acidity seem to have vanished (not that they are that persistent in this beer to begin with).  I really like that, who needs all the sourness/breadiness/acidity?  I dont see what it adds, other than maybe a more authentic feel.  Mouthfeel is perfect on this.  I think I drank my glass in 4 sips and almost opened the second bottle that Chris sent me.  Score is for this bottle.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1226,"2005-01-28",3.8,"Pours a ruby orange color...very strong sweet malt aroma.  Sweet flavors of carmel and brown sugar.  Nice and warm in the mouth with a hint of bitterness in the finish.

1226,"2005-01-24",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 24, 2005 Minor rating update.  2005 bottle seemed more separated than the 2004 batch - alcohol was more discernable and the balance was a bit more off, thus the rerate where Ive bumped the overall from 17 to 15.  Nevertheless, the 2004 full review...Pours an amber brown, reminiscent of an Oktoberfest. Smell and taste are rightly matched: rich and sweet. This beer matches its description well: a doppelbock with an Oktoberfest personality. Elements of caramel, malt, brown sugar and toasted cinnamon are predominant. This beer is very warming - even coming straight from the fridge, this beer doesnt taste or feel cold - a testament to the subtlety high alcohol-by-volume content. Different, but good. Personally, I prefer Capitals Dark Doppelbock.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

The pour is very non-carbonated...headless with no lacing to speak of. Clear deep amber color with an aroma of malt, brandy, and a citrusy apricot. The flavor is very malty, sweet and dry in the finish. Medium to full bodied mouthfeel, non carbonated but very sticky and almost cloying.

Aroma is deep, malty, very fruity and somehow delicately farmy in its herbal and earthy suggestions. Diplomatic and gentle melon, peaches and several fruit notes yet not hiding its substance (8.5% after all). Mango and not quite ready greenish oranges accompany obvious leather tones. Very approachable at first, but developping into a surprisingly bold fruitiness and more alcohol at it reaches room temperature. Medium bodied, light-medium carbonation is appropriate.

As smooth a palate as any Doppelbock I have tried, creamy with a subtle effervescence that gives the tongue a slight tingleA strong cotton candy sweetness masks a good deal of the alcohol initially while the strong, fruity (apples, pears, raisins, and melons) malts coat the tongue.

It was a little thin, which suprised me. The flavour was decent, but nothing to write home about. It was a bit sticky and it had a good balance. I guess it just wasnt as flavourful as I had hoped.

1226,"2004-10-09",3.8,"10/8/04.  Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, obtained in a trade with DavidP from RateBeer 10/1/04.  Pours a glistening ruby-caramel color, transparent but seeming slick.  Nice little tuft of a tan head, lingering moderately with some blotchiness and fairly good, lightly patchy, lightly shimmering lacing.  Sweet leafy caramel malt aroma with some spiced pumpkin and superripe banana.  Taste is surprisingly sharply bitter with a tinge of acrid black malt and a sticky sappiness to go along with medium-sharp German malts.  Sweetness and very slight nuttiness, and while theres a lot going on, its not really that interesting or special.  Some mulchy flavors and a touch of acidity as well.  I like the spice, but all of the flavors seems to be parallel and direct, not really overlapping or intertwining in any elegant way, and with very little depth or breadth.  Finish has a haunting butter caramel, a bit too much lingering dark marshmallowy sweetness.  Sticky dried sap on the lips, medium body with a smooth transition to the finish, but the flavors arent exactly what Im looking for in a doppelbock.  I must confess, however, that Im a sucker for the style.  I love me some doppelbocks.

The 04 version just came out and has some new wrinkles.  A rich tan head crowns this ebony beer, darker than previous versions.  Nice aroma of malts, with a biscuit and toasted flavor.  Sweetness is much better disguised in this version by the balanced hops.  Excellent overall.  I thought the previous versions were a bit too sweet.

This brew pouyred a medium sized head of fine to medium sized mostly lasting light brown colored bubbles that left behind a fair lacing and a hazy brown colored body with no visible carbonation.  The nose is made  up of a rice caramel malt with an essence of hop to it.  The mouthfeel starts off smoothm, tingles in the middle and finishes with a mild alcohol hop bite.  The alcohol mouthfeel increases as it warms and begins to burn slightly as it goes down.  The flavor is a very tasty vinuous caramel malt hop one with its alcohol content overpowering the other flavors.  Was that a hint of maple in the background?  I copped a decent buzz of of one bottle.  I wonder what the ABV of this brew is.  I would guess around 8-10%.  It definately has some kick to it.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1226,"2003-09-23",4.2,"Amazing color, brightly deep, ruby reddish fire color with a hint of brownish tone darkening it up a bit more. Maybe thats where they came up with the name 'Autumnal Fire'. Vigorous pour produced a hefty dark ivory, smoothened head with some bigger bubbles and little divets, slowly draining down to a fine skim always present and some sticky thick stringed lace and spots.
Aroma is that of most Capital brews, a familiar malty sweetness with some notes of thick starfuit and very dulled dark citrusy-like plums and melons, roastyness is light and very subdued and lends some caramel. 
Taste is also very much like other Capital brews, with the familiar malty sweetness, reminds me of the Maibock and Blonde Dopplebock, sweetness is incredibly smooth and buttery with good amounts of caramel malts, furnishing some toffee and very dulled fruits; starfruit, light plum, over ripe melon, and fig. Not all that complex, but loaded full of malts, just as a good dopple should be, as this is. Lightly chewy and sticky, but smooth over all, medium body feel with a lingering sweetness in the finish.

1226,"2002-10-15",3.4,"Didnt really seem like any doppelbock that I had had before.  Strong, but not that  much body. Not quite a ""brandy snifter"" beer, but warmer than many.  The flavors (beyond a powerful sweetness) are subdued, a little too subdued for my taste.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","mjmurphy2"
1226,"2002-10-05",4.3,"(bottle) Interesting dark reddish-amber color.  Nice initial head that thins out fairly quickly, but sticks around to the end of the glass.  Son of a gun, this stuff is a malt-lovers dream.  Very sweet.  I honestly cant detect much in the way of hops but that isnt such a big deal--theres enough depth to this brew without it.  This beer has plenty of body and heft.  The sweetness is almost syrupy, but not unpleasant in the least.  S M O O T H, with just the right amount of carbonation.  Drank this a few hours after sampling a Spaten Optimator dopplebock; have to say theyre neck & neck as far as my tastebuds go...","Wisconsin, USA","NeonLX"
1226,"2002-09-26",4.1,"It is called Autumnal Fire for a reason.  I would agree with the commercial description of a ""Brandy Snifter beer"", it puts some fire in your belly.  Has a slight fruit taste to it.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
1226,"2002-09-26",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2003 Hazy redish copper color,fruity candy like aroma, taste of light maple syrup and cotten candy, sweet but balanced , thick, heavy and very tasty, another great one from this great brewery.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MaxPower"
1226,"2002-09-25",4.4,"Huge cap explosion.Color of a fall leaf.Head vanishes quickly.Fruit,caramel,alcohol,raisins all in aroma.Little vanilla in there also.Carbonation is perfect which lets this slide right over the tounge.Flavors are stronger than aromas but match perfectly.Really thick,strong,and warming.Heading out to the porch swing to finish mine.Great Suprise!","Evansville, Indiana, USA","raindog"
1226,"2002-09-24",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 30, 2007 Clear dark copper color with a tall small bubbled tan head.  Fall aromas of caramel apples along with hearty malt ad tinge of alcohol.  Smooth feel as you first sip that leads to the alcohols evaporating on the tongue and whafting to the nose.  Ahh... the smell of Fall in the air.  Light fruit, toffee, dark rum find there way on the palate.  Finishs slightly warming with a presents of deep malt flavors.  Later the flavors of husky grain still lingers as the alcohol really starts to to it synapse misfiring.  Watch the leaves turn and sunset as you enjoy this one. Rerate: Seems to have lost a touch of the depth. Much like the Winter Skol, this one has had its better years. A decent autumn dopplebock. Not quite out of favor, just not quite as flavorful and deep.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1226,"2002-09-22",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2006 Creamy white head turns rocky.  Meaty doppelbock aroma of cotton candy, brown sugar, black cherry, prune, and spicy alcohol.  Not too complex, but the evidence is here to show what a carefully nurtured brew in the making this was.  Velvety carbonation provides dreaminess to my palate;  absolutely perfect.  Alcohol warmth turned my face red.  Flavors are quite refined.  Raisin, caramel, grape, and toffee.  Jet puffed  marshmallow cream texture and flavors to boot.  Just lovely!  Finshes with maple, caramel, and vanilla with a burnt sugar tingle.  My thumbs go up to Capital for making this quite the Autumn seasonal.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

1226,"2002-01-20",3.7,"Seems really close to a maerzen, really out of place among doppelbocks--strong, almost fruity malt character, with a decent dose of hops. A solid session beer, though Im not usually a fan of lagers of this ilk.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
1226,"2001-12-02",4.1,"Is this a Dobblebock, a Festbeer, a winter warmer, or what?  Whatever it is it is quite fine. A beautiful dense off-white head sits atop a marverously colored beer of reds and scorched copper
  Usually I dont like quite as much caramel character in my lager, but this one has such vigor that I dont mind.   Moderatly sweet for a strong lager with hints of toffie and a restrained bitterness.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","Northernbrewer"
