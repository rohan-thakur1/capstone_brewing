Clarté nette. Bulles fines partout vives.

Sip : Low to medium density with a medium carbonation ; really easy to drink. Sweet with a kick of grapefruit and lemon zest bitterness that lats untill the aftertaste. Damn its a sofisticated citrusy taste ! The grapefruit for bitterness, the lemon zest for spikes and orange to balance it into a great finish. Im really surprised ! Great taste !
