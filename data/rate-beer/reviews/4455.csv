Kriek ma barwę czerwonego wina, soku wiśniowego.
Piana na początku dość obfita, jasnoróżowa, z średnim tempem redukująca się do obrączki wokół szkła.
W aromacie na pierwszy plan wysuwa się przyjemna nuta wiśni, takich w całości ze skórką i pestką w środku, pachnie niczym przefermentowane czerwone wino, następnie dochodzi cała masa dzikich akcentów, takich jak świeża skóra, końska derka, lekkie nuty stajenne, zwietrzałe siano, ujawnia się także owocowa kwaśność wraz z pestkowścią wpadającą w lekki migdał. Pachnie świetnie.
W smaku dają o sobie znać wiśnie, takie lekko kwaśne, ale zarazem soczyste w środku. Kwaśność jest na umiarkowanym poziomie nie za mała i nie przesadzona. Oprócz tego dochodzą nuty funk oraz wcześniej wspomniana owocowa kwaśność. Na samym końcu można poczuć przyjemną pestkowość wpadającą miejscami w migdał.
Finisz pozostaje w tonie winno-cierpkim.
Wysycenie jest średnie, a każdy łyk piwa w ustach przyjemnie musuje na całym podniebieniu.
Całość jest pięknie zbalansowana, świetnie orzeźwia, odświeża, a pomimo dość sporego ""waltażu"" bardzo pijalna.
Podsumowując jest to bardzo dobry kriek, zdecydowanie lepszy od wersji oude(bez Mariage Parfait) z tego samego browaru.","Szczecin, POLAND","BrewGuide32"

4455,"2017-03-22",4.5,"2013 bottle sampled in 2017. I need to drink stuff like this more often! Poured a rich ruby-purple color, initially clear but I poured the dregs, so its a cloudier richer purpler color. Nose is complex, cherries sure, but cherry stone, oak, old stale cheese, hay/straw, old barn, .Dry and tart, with dry cherry and oak, fairly tannic. Just a little kiss of sweetness in there near the finish. So drinkable I just want to gulp it but I must fight that so I can savor. Carbonation is fine, a little stinging carbonic acidity. Finish reminds of the old barn and straw notes from the nose. Theres one more thing in the aroma/flavor that I cant quite distinguish - seems like a spice of some sort (not that its spiced but just something funky and reminiscent of a spice, like cardamom or something.

Slightly funky aroma thats bursting with intense cherry flavor. Theres some lactic acid, funky bugs, horse blanket and barnyard character but its really fruit forward, to the point where Im picking up the skin and pit of the fruit. Slightly damp smelling with cobweb and ancient oak but not as intensely funky as other lambic. Mostly because of the prominent fruit. 

Full bodied, intensely tart and puckering with a much funkier flavor than the aroma suggests. Lots of barnyard, sour acidity and lactic funk along with damp, toasted oak and a sweet vinous fruit character. Slightly syrupy and sweet with a strong cherry/cherry juice flavor. Very organic tasting with cherry skin and juicy fruit flavor balancing out the funk and acetic acid. Again, the pit from the fruit is evident, complimenting the funk and charred oak. Subtle acetic vinegar lingering in the bone dry finish but its not harsh or solvent like at all with plenty of juicy cherry fruit flavor balancing things out.

Yields a beautiful, half finger broad, pink head, slowly collapsing into the ruby red beer, while leaving with a fizzy sound. Sheets of lacing gather at the edge of the glass, complimenting the glowing, red grape juice colored beer.

Packs a good amount of funk and lemon zest, settling on top of a ripe cherry foundation, together with arid forest earth. Rusty blue cheese and old leather enhance the cherry character, as well as the tartness, while the beer doesnt turn overly sour at all. The nose features a beautifully balanced lambic, with a very intriguing cherry complexity, mainly defined by mellow stone pith qualities, lemon peel and more earth. 

Highly carbonated, sprizzy beer, leaving the palate with lively bubbles. The beers medium body comes well together, while the mineral defined carbonation introduces tart funk to the palate, easily balanced by well pronounced malts. Drinks fairly easy and clean, no note of the higher abv, other than the distinct maltiness.

Tastes of a bubbly minerality from the high carbonation which sets the course for tart lemon peel and cherry pulp. Cherry gets accompanied by scented wood and earthen malts, which produce an unusual toffee note during the long lasting finish, turning more prominent than the sourness itself after the swallow. Reaches its sour peak right at the middle during drinking, becomes the most funky while swallowing and turns very malty and sweet, but not cherry sweet during the finish, accompanied by a lemony minerality.

Well made, very clean tasting lambic which is a bit surprising for the higher abv it packs. The finish bothers me though, it is way too malty and sweet. While it still succeds at including a lemony note during the aftertaste, the cherries fade too soon, getting replaced by dusty toffee malts.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Deep dark ruby coloured body with a very fast-dying pink and rosey head. Aroma of yeast, bread, light cherries, grass, malt, wheat and tons of oak notes - more of the wood scents than any fruit. Medium-bodied; Assertive effervescence with a very pleasant yeast character, some subdued wheat and malt notes, but the very noticeable and puckering cherry flavour followed by a complex and definitive oak and cedar flavour at the end. Aftertaste is very pleasant with a light grassy and herbal flavour, but the sour cherry notes come through with an emphasis on the structured yeast characteristics.

4455,"2014-09-06",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2015 One of the greats among old krieks, with malse lambic and a higher ABV - and higher cherry dosis than is customary. Re-rating based on a 2 year old bottle; this was actually the first traditional lambic beer I ever had, many years ago, when I had no experience with them whatsoever so it is about time to revisit it.  Quite some pressure on the bottle upon removing the cork.  Remarkably thick, regular, dense and moussy, off-pink head, colour is a beautifully deep bright ruby red, a tad darker than usual for the style (probably a combination of the above average amount of cherries on the one hand and the above average ABV for the style on the other hand).  Rich and appetizing aroma of macerated cherries of course, but also blueberry, blackberry and strawberry, sour yoghurt, some wood, old sherry, wet leather, more subtle hints of the rosy smell of fresh menure (but in a good way, this is lambic!), horse stable, yellow passion fruit - in all, the delightful fruit overload is shown off to a much greater extent than the lambic funkiness, and this is exactly how Frank Boon intended it to be.  Crisp, estery, sour onset, a little bit puckering even with a lemony edge, but mostly a ton of sour cherries and all kinds of red and dark berries, even a little bit sweet in an otherwise sour context; champagne-like, refined carbonation adds liveliness just the way it should be.  Softer lactic acidity takes over and the deep soapy wheat and bready barley structure supports a conveyor belt of rich, juicy fruitiness right down to the finish, where everything comes together in a perfectly balanced manner: the sugars of the fruit (even a bit strawberry-like), the grain bill, the wild fermentation effects with leathery, hayish and yoghurt-like retronasal effects, a hint of drying woodiness but not as much as usual in this style, a very subtle hint of earthy hops but not interfering with all this fruit lambic complexity, and even some warming, liqueurish alcohol far away in the background, very pleasing.  I remember how shocked I was by its acidity the first time I tasted this without any experience, but in retrospect, this is actually a soft, malse cherry lambic, elegant yet lush and thick, a true masterpiece in the league of traditional fruit lambics.  However subtle and graceful it may be, it has a personality of its own.  Highly recommendable if you are after richness combined with subtlety and balance.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

08 375ml bottle.


A - Pours ruby red with a fizzy half finger tall white head, dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving no lace at all down the glass. Much like the geuze, it went totally flat within minutes.


S - Smells of ripe sour cherries, damp earth, basement must, bit of barnyard funk, lactic sourness, oak and some wet grass. Not as earthy as the geuze thanks to the addition of the cherries but it still just doesnt jump out at me like others in the style.


T - Starts off with the sour cherries quickly giving way to a mix of sharp lactic sourness, musty funk, grass and a touch of sweetness help round it all together. Finish is quite dry, lingering long after the finish. Liking how much the cherries come through here compared to the nose.


M - Medium body with spritzy carbonation. While the geuze was more tart this is a bit more sour, still has plenty of dryness after each sip. 


O - I enjoyed this one a bit more than the geuze but it still wasnt worth what I had to pay for them. I think their are better examples of the style but if the price was right I would definitely pick up another bottle.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

What a gorgeous beer. A simply perfect appearance. Radiant ruby hues with soft pink accents when held to the light. Pinkish purple head that measures over a half inch thick. Excellent retention and lacing. A joy to observe.

The aroma is top notch as well. Sour cherries take center stage, with funky, musty, oak in supporting roles.

Lots of cherry flavor. Just the right amount of funk and sour presence. Enough to induce the slightest pucker, but so smooth I could drink several glasses and not grow weary of it. Homemade cherry pie? One of the most easy drinking fruit lambics I have had in a while.

8% abv? Difficult to believe. Alcohol content is masterfully disguised. Ridiculously smooth on palate, with a lingering aftertaste of tart cherries.

Overall, fantastic. So glad I was able to get a few of these. A must have for the lambic connoisseur.

S - Intensely sour cherries, oaky tannins, and some spices. A bit of warming alcohol on the end.

Pours a really nice red color with a beautiful pink head that sticks around for quite some time, leaving behind ample lacing. The nose has a bit of a dry herbal character along with some oak and cherries. Mild acid in there as well. The flavor has more dry earthiness and an odd herbal character. Cherries are fairly minimal. Bit of an oak presence with a touch of tannin. Dry finish without too much acid. Nowhere near as good as the plain Mariage Parfait.

4455,"2011-04-10",3.5,"375 ml from TheEpeeist. Thanks, Chris! We dont seem to get this around these parts. Just the Gueze. Pours a murky deep berry hue, purple and red, well hazed, with big cakey pink head atop, dies down slowly, a thicker film, ok lacing overall. Deep red berry like cranberry juice. Aromas are sour cherries, cherry skins, wet oak, touches of lactic acid, yogurt, some light touches of vinegar, touches of more sour cherries, malty breads, and touches of funky brett, dust, and hay grow as it warms more. Initial is lighter bodied, with some light sour cherries, faint vinegar, a bit sweeter for my liking. Some cherry juice, touches of wet oak, vanilla tannins, a touch of cough drops (but not full blown cough syrup). A touch more spritzy tartness on the backend, cherry skins, and bready malts, light bretty funk, dryness. The beer isnt too sweet, but it lacks the oomph of some of my favorite Krieks.

The aroma is well balanced, showing a light, dusty, bretty barrel funk over a rainbow of cherry varietals, from sweet and dark to light and acidic.  Flavors follow suit, again coming across sweet-tart with fleshy dark cherry and softly tannic skins, all with a nod to aging barnyard wood and farmhouse dust.  Sour acidity is there, but its kept well in check at this age (though I expect that it would continue to funk/sour up).

4455,"2010-07-15",3.5,"2007 Vintage bottle, at In de Verzekering tegen de Grote Dorst; July 2010
The beer pours from the bottle with a deep red, brilliantly clear color.  The head is a pink, frothy, initially two-finger thick head.  This smells of berries, a complex, jam-like cherry flesh and rich cherry skin aromatics.  There are some sharp woody mushroom notes, a cherry acidity as well as some notes of childrens aspirin.  It is interesting how fast the huge cherry aromatics disappear; the nose is still all about the cherry notes, but it is not nearly as pungent as when this was first poured.

The beer tastes sweet up front, then tart and it finishes with a complex, chewy, cherry skin fruit character.  There is a fizzy, carbonic acid bite to this beer that helps to lighten up the texture; it still has a certain chewiness to it, at least for a Lambic, though it is not in any way heavy.  The acidity is tart, not aggressively sour, but still enough that I can feel it in my stomach; it is actually somewhat soft, but some cherry acid notes make it not entirely soft and it has a sort of interesting dichotomy between the Lactic and cherry acid notes.

This is quite nice, I definitely prefer a bit more funkiness and complexity in my Lambics, but this definitely gets the job done.  It is very quaffable, though perhaps just a touch heavier than I prefer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

This is dusty, extra-sour, extra-tart and especially extra-dry.  Never though Id find a beer drier than 3 Fonteinen Framboos but here we are.

4455,"2008-03-16",3.7,"Cleveland tasting - 750 ml bottle
I got a small sample of this towards the end of the night.  There was a little sign of this one being over the hill but overall it wasnt bad.  I have now had the trifecta of Framboise, Kriek and Gueuze; the Framboise is still my favorite.
Aroma / Appearance - A murky red body swirled fluidly around the glass producing no carbonation or head.  The scent of stale cherries blended with an extremely mellow sourness to form something that was less powerful than I was expecting.  A few years ago this was probably pretty potent stuff.  For now the edge is gone.
Flavor / Palate - Even after twenty other imperial stouts, gueuzes and sour beers this was easy to drink.  It has definitely mellowed over time and is in decline if you are looking for that lambic kick.  On the other hand there is still just a bit of cherriness left to make it worthwhile.  It was better than some of the feeble attempts at fruit beers but Id rather have tried this in its prime.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

There is a massive amount of sediment that has permanently attached itself to the side of the bottle, which is proof that it has been resting on its side for quite some time.

Flavor is a mind blower. Slight sour tones. Kriek character is still going fairly strong. Cherry characteristics seem to be mixed in with a wood tone. Feel is silly smooth. 

Unbelievably drinkable. Its almost sherry or port like. But an aged version. This was my first seriously aged beer, so I am sure my naiveté is making a difference here.

Lacing is a uniform layer that slides and doesnt stick, but stays together in a sheet of bubbles that stack together and just wait until you equalize a tilted glass to make their way down.  Smell is almost over-ripe cherries in almost equal proportion to yeasty brett.  Cherries dont make their appearance in the flavor until right after the swallow; before that, the sourness is almost exactly like an intense Italian ice (more citric than Cantillon).  Delicious, but not as complex as it could be.  Finish is a lingering acid and brett, with the acid breaking in waves and then resting in intermitent brettty driness.  Occassionally, an earthy prick hits the back of the tongue and adds a nice counterpoint to hte sour.

Strong, fresh, sweet raspberry flavour with balanced, tart acidic finish and plenty of funk.  Medium body with soft, collapsing effervescence that engages the tongue and cheeks.

Dull reddish-brown body with thin, white, fully-diminishing head and plenty of floating protein chunks.  Im not sure how you all can give this such high appearance scores, it really did not look at all appealing to me.  Sour cherries, farmhouse and leathery character are still there in the flavour but struggle to the surface through iron, dust, cardboard and a unidimensional acidity.  Flavour dies very quickly in the mouth.  Body feels thin, dry and lifeless with almost no carbonation and a rather watery texture.

Dully, dirty, muddy reddish-brown, dried blood with little head...mostly sour fruit in the nose, cherries and a bit of apples, dusty and decayed...very low carbonation flattens the flavor profile, dusky old cherries and dried grasses warding off challenges of light bitter chocolate and licorice...funkiness in the background does not erase general lack of impact.

Just a shame it doesnt go everywhere with the same intensity.  Aroma is light, dry and corky, spiced with a touch of nutmeg, very tart cherry and some wood.  Very lovely.  Flavor is tart to start, with dark cherry, a hint of dirt and moss, not enough funk.  Still, it grows on you, but its a bit underwhelming.  Body is slightly watery, a bit too slick.

This old kriek was very aromatic, and its inimitable bouquet was full with hints of red fruits, ( noorderkrieken )= sour cherrys, ambrosial beetrooth, old Pinot Noir and some fresh mint. It had a marvallous sour flavour with a touch of mulberry and some pear in red wine with a tiny hint of clove. It had a very long afthertaste but the sourness was taking the upperhand in the end.

Classic lambic aroma, very sour and tart with musty cheese rind notes.  Cleary the sourest lambic I've tried, with an almost puckering sour, tart, woody flavor with cheese rind and dust.  The cherries added to the tartness but their presence was surprisingly subdued; this is no ""sweet"" lambic, and the fruit flavor has all but vanished in the sour depths.
