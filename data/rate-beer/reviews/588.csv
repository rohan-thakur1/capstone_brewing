588,"2016-09-15",3.4,"Une double après une smoked. Une fois le défilé des camions de pompiers qui nen finissaient plus de courir aux incendies terminé, on ferme la Caserne 30 puis on se lance dans la double. Comment heurter mes habitudes biéristiques. Robe ambrée plutôt pâlotte surmonté dune anneau mousseux. Malts caramélisés, prune rouge, touche dépices, corps moyen, effervescence plaisante. Une dubbel qui ne vient clairement pas de Belgique mais dont linterprétation de ce style me ravit. Aucun arrière-goût, les saveurs sont brèves, délicates et agréables. Son manque de profondeur en fait une dubbel de soif, aussi étrange cela puisse-t-il être.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

588,"2009-10-12",3.1,"Tap @ DDC. A dissapointing beer by this brewer. Maybe because its called a double I expected it to be one but it isnt. Quite out of style, the nose is full of american hops, lacks malt sweetness in the nose and in the taste and lacks the promised ""Belgian-ness"" That being said its quite drinkable, just lacks identity.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

Pungently bitter aroma of slightly burnt roast malt and cranberry - mildly spicy.  Taste is the same - strongly bitter, near-burnt caramel malt with tart fruit admixed.  Pretty decent body and it has a long carbonized linger and aftertaste, with some odd pungent herbal/spice notes left on the tongue.  I didnt get much chocolate, but it was reasonably complex and I would gladly drink it again.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

588,"2007-10-23",3.5,"Large weizen glass at the brewery on 9/29/07Clear, with a light chill-haze and a magnificent auburn-chestnut-mahogany color with a very prominent, well-retained, beige head that laces wonderfully.  A very lovely draught appearance on a Belgian beer.Nose is first sweet and fruity, with raisins, dates, plums and bits of piquant currants perking up, as light clove phenols begin to weave dryness in to the nose.  Tentative roasted notes are well-integrated in to the softer malts, which allow chocolate and caramel to not become a burden on the lighter pale malts.  Minimal hoppiness, as per the style, and more and more cherry skin-like esters as the beer warms and breathes.  Quite Belgian in nature, with a proper yeast.  Exceedingly clean and well-brewed with light cola notes lingering on the finish.  No alcohol or flaws, medium to medium-high strength of aroma.Soft and chewy, with plenty of raisin and a tasteful amount of anise and clove to balance.  Caramel and vanilla-like sweetness are certainly present, but the carbonation is strong enough to cleanse the palate, and, with aid of the light roasted/toasted malt notes, it provides a perfect foil to the sweetness.  Cherry, cola, almond and all the dark fruits you would want out of a dubbel, are represented here well.  My only criticism would be the excessive cleanness of the beer, but thats hardly something you can fault the brewer on.  Further, Id like to see a little less creamy-soft sweetness, as the raisiny-caramel notes do build slightly, by the end (and as the carbonation dies off and the beer warms).  More attenuation would help pronounce and lend more poignancy to the tart, fruity esters.  Great stuff, though.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
588,"2007-10-18",3.5,"11 of 13 tasters, and the beer that my friends drank full glasses of while I sifted through the full roster of amazingly varied and damn nice beer.  Pours dark orange amber brown with a bright white ring.  Nose was sweet, sticky, and full of malts that are reminiscent of belgian beers.  Sweet mild slightly strange taste that I sometimes get with certain dubbels and belgian strongs.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
588,"2007-09-24",3.5,"Cloudy copper-orangey body with a small off-white head.  Autumn 2007 batch is 6.5%.  Name leads us to believe that this is a Dubbel but I think the generic Belgian Strong Ale ratebeer is more appropriate (Belgian Ale would be even better imho).  Far from the creamy/nutty of a trappist-style dubbel this is a refreshing fruity Belgian ale.  Full typical Belgian body, very yeasty with lots of different fruit flavours co-existing (berries, prunes, citrus, tropical fruits, cherries).  The caramelized malt backbone remains discreet.  Light but nice tartness and cherry-ish sourness.  Somewhat sweet.  Overall impression of drinking a fruity pie made with those multi-fruits breakfast jam.  A more generous and expressive hopping and that could have been excellent.  Renewed my love o fthis pub.  I had this one after a pint of their Neuvaine experiment and it felt like makeup sex after a big dispute.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

588,"2003-09-27",2.9,"UPDATED: OCT 25, 2003 I expected a lot, but as MartinT pointed me out, it's far from a typical dubbel and I'm happy not to see it in that style on the site database. It's basically dark brown with very fugacious head, well-laced nevertheless. Neglectable carbonation. The nose reminds of chocolate milk. Weird malt taste.. I don't know how to qualify it, flat malt comes to mind. The texture reminds of coke, somewhat powdery, but very smooth and sliding on the tongue. Overly sweet and definitely not one that impressed me.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

21-Sep-03: 5-3-7-5-16-3.6 Big aroma - malty with something funky in there... Definitely odd although not necessarily bad. Beautiful deep brown colour with a finger of head of tight small dense bubbles. Some lacing. Good malt flavour roasted malts initially apparent rounded out by asweet caramel flavour with a touch of alcohol warming in the finish. Mouthfeel of this beer is absolutely fantastic.
