220,"2014-03-08",3.4,"Appearance: Nearly clear, gold body with a smallish, white head.

Smell: Strong top note of grain, like a just-opened malt sack. A little hinted sweetness, a little grape ester on deeper sniffs.

Taste: Sweetish, honeyish cereal maltiness. Lightly husky, crusty breadiness. A light spice, a sliver herb, and an altogether faint fruitiness. Modestly bitter. Drying finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium-low carbonation.

Overall: Decent enough, would prefer a livelier effervescence. Cant we go back to their 1st generation Kolsch?","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
