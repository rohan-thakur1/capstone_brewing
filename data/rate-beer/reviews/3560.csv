3560,"2016-12-11",4.2,"750ml bottle acquired via deyholla. Thanks as always, dude. One Ive been keeping an eye on because I gotta get me those Clevar rews. Pours a hazy golden straw hue, lively cascading bubbles through the body with a faint smoked orange honey glow. Bright white head atop is sizable, crowns and sticks around well. Nice lacing and retention, pretty stuff. Aromas show a tangy tart lactic appeal, bready malts and straw meet some decent to firm smoked appeal. Woody, slightly meaty with a peppery and bacon like jerky feel. Mellow yogurty, oak and char elements seem energized here. Initial is tart, fruity, a bit of apple and firm lemon meet some pleasant acidity, yogurt and smokey essence. Bready malts, smokepit and fire meet bacon, mesquite, and meaty appeal. Campfire without being too aggressive or overwhelming, but still holding the reigns firm. Decent oak, firm sourness and some gentle bready malt, cereal appeal at times. Some tangy smoked meat, wood, campfire and outdoor woody appeal. Crisp and cool, flavorful and rich with still being pretty light in body, manageable on the palate. Firm lactic tang, oak, pleasant tapering smokey appeal as we press on. Oaky, woody elements linger a bit back here with some cereal grains, firm acidity and tangy citric and lactic appeal. Earthy, a bit bready, some oat and lingering barrel elements. Very delicious stuff. Perhaps not for everyone but Id have to say an inviting alluring nose, pretty pour, delicious flavors that really pop and a melding of all these strikingly different elements together is quite masterful stuff. Bravo.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

3560,"2016-10-30",3.8,"October 2016 - Bottle share at CBC Islington as Fair State Lichtenhainer. Thanks to JK for this one. Possibly my first ever Lichtenhainer. I cant remember one anyway. Pity its not from Germany, but beggars cant be choosers. Hazy yellow, opaque with a foamy off-white head. Aroma is bacon up front, smokey, light citrus. Body is smooth with tingly carbonation, slightly foamy. Taste has more lemon drizzled bacon, light sugary malt, smooth with some smoke, touches of blue cheese. Really interesting. I like the sour and smoke combination. Can we have more of these please? (3.8)","Richmond, Greater London, ENGLAND","The_Osprey"

3560,"2016-10-04",3.9,"Pour is gold with little to no head. Unique aroma of tart lemon, barnyard funk, grass, and smoke. The flavor is a bit unusual, but in a good way. The in your face smokiness kind of mellows out the puckering sourness, not totally but somewhat. Interesting beer and not for the faint of heart.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
3560,"2016-10-03",4.3,"Rating from notes: Massive funky bacon nose. Sour with just the right amount of smoke. Love this beer, crushable.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
3560,"2016-09-30",4.2,"Gorgeous aroma! One of the best. Beautiful brett complemented by the smoke. Thinnish body (not its strong suit), light feeling. Could be more sour but the smoke...wow, wow, wow. Light yellow color, hazy. (Poured at the Ale Jail beer festival, St. Paul)","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
3560,"2016-09-20",4.1,"Bottle. Hazy pale yellow color with a small head. Very pungent bacony smoke aroma, verging on artificial. Such a funky flavor... Rampant oak, smoke, and bacon, coupled with a strong lemony tartness. Damn is this a unique beer. Pretty acidic. Dry, tart finish. Fairly light bodied.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
3560,"2016-09-10",4.1,"8 oz. pour, on tap at the brewerys taproom in Nordeast Minneapolis, Minnesota. Consumed on 9-9-16. Hazy, pale orange/gold. Small amount of beige head. Pleasant color and the right amount of haziness. Smoky, medicinal aroma. Somewhere between peaty scotch and classic rauchbier. Very nice smell. Lemon juice tartness in aroma. Quite smoky. A touch of urine, which isnt as bad as it sounds but detracts slightly from an otherwise excellent aroma. Hot dog with bun in aroma and flavor. Really nice, smoky, medicinal, iodine flavor. It does remind me of an Islay scotch. Quite lemony tart too. Really nice base sour with an excellent, sophisticated smoke overlay. Quite delicious. The medicinal quality I interpret more in an iodine-like way and not as a flaw. Peach and mixed berry. Good, acidic aftertaste. Lively and frothy. Light body. Nothing special in the palate after the aftertaste. Really powerful in flavor. A contender for the best Fair State beer I have had. Superb and delicious.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
3560,"2016-09-04",3.8,"Keg @ Fair State. Hazy gold pour with a small head. Nose has nice earthy smoke character. Nice funky citrus tang supporting more meaty smoky flavors. Nice and crisp. Eminently crushable. Light and zippy. Nice lichtenhainer.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
3560,"2016-06-30",3.9,"On tap at the brewery. Pours a cloudy light yellow gold with a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a light wheat smoke note with a decent amount of a lemony sour note. Flavor has strong sour lemon with some bitterness supported by a light smokiness.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
3560,"2016-06-26",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 20, 2017 At Fair State Mixed Culture event. Orange color. Lots of smoke in the aroma and the flavor. Sour yeast. Smoke flavor and a bacon character, which has become a cliche description for smoked beers, and a flavor I seldom perceive, but I do it get it here. Good beer.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
