2706,"2017-05-24",3.3,"12 oz bottle, now named ""Thristie Mutilator."" Pours golden with a few particles. Aroma has pale malt and some yeatiness. Easy-drinking pale malt flavor with citrus hops and yeast around the edges, a touch of green grape toward the finish. Good at what it does.","Northville, Michigan, USA","flatmatt"
2706,"2015-03-07",3.5,"Bottle. Cloudy yellow with thick white head that quickly disappates. Smells of bread dough with slight hint of citrus. Thin body, moderate carbonation, and crisp finish. Tastes of bread, fruit, and a little bitterness. Very enjoyable.","Michigan, USA","eaglebones"
2706,"2015-02-14",3.5,"Cloudy straw color. Fine blend of malt and hops. Avoids excess sweetness. 12 ounce bottle for $1.00 on special.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","milewide"
2706,"2014-12-31",3.4,"Bottle to pint. Looks good; a hazy pineapple with white head. Smells bready with notes of lager yeast and light esters. Tastes like it smells with some pleasant hop notes that makes the flavor much more balanced. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied. Solid beer that smells better than it tastes.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
2706,"2014-12-26",3.7,"(Identified as a Helles style lager on the bottle) Bready/doughy aroma to start with, and it pours a mostly clear light straw with a full white head. Malt forward, with dough and bread flavors starting it off, then fading to a nice crisp bitterness. This is a nice, light drinking, flavorful lager.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","Nephilium"
2706,"2014-12-13",3.7,"Pours a slightly hazy light peach color with an off-white head. Nose is light, mostly bread and cereal, some hints of citrus. Medium to light body, nice smooth mouthfeel, Medium carbonation, slightly sweet biscuit. Very nice, really does remind me of a Munich helles.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","bigtaster"
2706,"2014-12-05",3.9,"Lager like smell and look with lasting head, this tastes like a light beer with flavor that still has the abv that you desire, good stuff","Howell, Michigan, USA","lukedarock"
2706,"2014-11-22",3.8,"12 oz bottle...a slightly cloudy straw yellow color and pure white head. Taste is a blend of sourdough bread and lemons. Very refreshing and finishes with a spicy bite. Well done.","Peoples Republic of Bloomington, Indiana, USA","paintedmaple"
2706,"2014-11-21",3.4,"Pour from a 12oz bottle, part of a Shorts sampler. Hazy yellow brew with thick creamy (and fore ever lasting) head. Aroma is grain, bread, lemon, a little grass. Taste is a nice slightly sweet malt at the start with a modest lemon/grass finish. Lingering sweetness and a bit of ethanol at the end of the swallow. Very enjoyable.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","Onslow"
2706,"2014-11-20",3.3,"ahh, idiocracy - a fine movie. out of the 12 oz bottle, straw and sourdough notes dominate, a golden hazy liquid with light carbonation and little head. more dough and toast in the body and some nice floral hops to keep things in check. nicely balanced but leaning towards a little alcohol heat, lacking a crispness that many pilsners have - perhaps from just a touch too much sweetness? a pretty decent brew regardless.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
2706,"2014-11-16",2.9,"Hazy golden orange color. Grains and some light lemon citrus in the aroma. Taste of grains, grassiness and lemon.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","fattybladdy"
2706,"2014-11-16",3.7,"12oz bottle, huge thanks to umich03jm. Wow, instant points for the label. One of the most fantastic I have ever seen. It is literally a My Little Pony with chainsaw arms. The blurb on the label -- ""Its not just light, its extremely electro-light!"" Love that. Combined with the name of the beer, this whole thing is a clear reference to the cult classic film ""Idiocracy"", which is much appreciated. Date on the neck of the bottle is 10/13/14. Almost an entirely hazy golden orange color. White head nearly fills the head space of the shaker pint, slowly reduces to a good thin amount, that retains and leaves good splotches and dots of lace. Medium body. Smooth, kind of fluffy full texture. Crisp, light to moderate bright tingly carbonation. Lightly slick texture. Fantastic big citrusy aroma, get some strawberry, some nice saaz hop pepperiness, much appreciated. Super complex interesting aroma for a lager, tons of interesting fruit nuances in there, which lend to the refreshing aspect of it. Yeah, its bigger ABV and bodied than expected for something advertised as ""extremely light"", but its as refreshing as anyone could hope for, especially with that complex, bright flavor. Moderate to bigger sweet taste, light bitter, and a light tanginess. A bit more bitter than your typical helles, but it works and I dig it. Indeed, super-refreshing, especially towards the end. Bigger body, but tons of bright flavor to back it up. Wonderful take on a helles. And possibly the best label ever... Definitely keeping this bottle.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
2706,"2014-11-15",3.8,"bottle. golden with one finger head. very light pleasant body with some lemon. grassy flavor. better than the sum of its parts -- this is an excellent beer.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"
2706,"2014-11-11",3.7,"Bottle: Fuzzy & cloudy golden, bright yellow body with lots of small bubble streams headed towards the silky off-white head perched on top; long lasting, slow to settle, leaving plenty of sheety lacing on the glass as it recedes. Bright aroma with slightly sweet pilsner malt, freshly baked bread, slightly spicy Noble hops, mild lemon-lime zest, lager yeast, & a very mild hint of DMS... Fresh & inviting. Very drinkable. Moderately sweet pilsner malts & mild grains with the lightest hint of cereal, splashes of lemon zest combatted by a slightly earthy, slightly herbal hop bite. Sweetbread, citrus, lemon-lime, a touch of chewy lager yeast, & a small bit of staunch, spicy hop that lingers in the after taste alongside the malt. Fresh, crisp mouth feel. Im a sucker for a good Munich Helles... This was quite tasty, super drinkable.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
2706,"2014-11-08",3.8,"Bottle. Cloudy amber pour with a small head that fades to a ring and leaves some decent lacing. Aroma is packed with grains, lemons, hay, grass, and bread dough. Tastes like fresh grains and bread mixed with lemon-y and hay-like hops. Like eating lemon bread, very cool. Some spicy hops in the finish as well. Medium body. High, sharp carbonation. Very enjoyable and unique pils.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
2706,"2014-11-01",3.9,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 10/13/2014. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean flavors with minimal yeast esters noticeable. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Munich helles style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
2706,"2014-10-31",3.9,"Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate dusty straw, light pilsner malt, lemon/lemon peel, and a touch of grass. It pours a transparent gold with a two finger white head that fades to a thin film outlined by a slightly thicker ring. There is some soapy lacing left on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with light-moderate honey and a touch of pilsner malt. The finish has light caramel, straw/grass, and a hint of lemon peel. Its light-medium bodied with soft carbonation and a somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is some really tasty stuff. Id like to see this bottled on its own in 6-packs.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
2706,"2013-05-18",3.4,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a murky gold with a white head. Crisp aroma, of yeast and malt. Taste is very sparkly and bright yeast and a hint of sweeter malt. Lingering sparkliness. Very refreshing.","San Diego, California, USA","dalekliz"
2706,"2013-04-22",3.4,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a pale gold with a thin head. Light grain aroma and taste with a slight hint of hops. A good session beer.","Bellaire, Michigan, USA","bpar73"
