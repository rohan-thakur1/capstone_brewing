1548,"2013-08-21",3.8,"On tap at Barrel & Grain for the CCB tap takeover. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. Lemon zest aromas. Mild lemon and citrus with tasty grain, oat, and German yeast? notes. Great mouthfeel, good body, and balance. The best wheat beer Ive had to date.","Florida, USA","50belair"
1548,"2013-01-31",3.4,"Draft... Hazy light-golden ale with a small, creamy, white head. The nose is both floral and citrusy. Medium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and middling carbonation. The flavor is certainly hoppy. This is essentially a medium-bitter American wheat ale. No sweetness and lots of citrusy bitterness. Finishes bitter and then Mojave-dry.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1548,"2013-01-18",3.6,"Draft.  Medium off-white head atop lightly hazed apple juice body, nice lacing.  Aroma is moderately sweet, orange, some grapefruit, wheat.  Taste is moderately sweet, orange, grapefruit.  Light body, quite drinkable.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
1548,"2013-01-10",3.6,"A hazed blonde ale with a thin lacing off white head. In aroma, a good dose of catty hops, Nelson Sauvin, wheat base, nice and smooth. In mouth, a nice smooth crisp wheaty malt with citrusy hops, nice and balanced. On tap at brewery, Dec. 9 2012.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
1548,"2013-01-06",3.6,"Good stuff. Aroma is wheat, citrus hops, and grain. Color is amber with a fluffy white head. Taste is all wheat and hops. Grainy citrus. Excellent and sessionable.","Florida, USA","OmegaX"
1548,"2013-01-01",3.8,"On tap at Green Room. Hazy yellow pour with a touch of orange under a nice off-white head that sticks and coats the glass. Pungent hoppy aroma with lots of bitterness, dankness, and fruitiness. Plenty of hop character in the flavor as well, again very dank and fruity. A pale, wheaty graininess lingers underneath. Not bad!","Georgia, USA","drowland"
1548,"2012-12-24",3.6,"On draft at Cigar City Tap Room. Hops...they werent kidding. Struck me more as a pale ale then anything. The wheaty flavor does come through here but the hops are pretty dominating here.",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"
1548,"2012-12-14",3.6,"Pint at the brewery. Pours a cloudy light gold. The aroma is absolutely great. There is a fresh citrus blast from the super potent hops. This hoppiness does not translate exactly in the flavor as the wheat overtakes things. There are some zesty citrus/pine notes but they battle to be noticed against the wheat. The finish is something like apricots. This was alright.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

1548,"2012-12-13",3.7,"On draft at Cigar City, poured a cloudy golden yellow color with aromas of straw, light wheat, citrus, and some hops.  Flavors are light grain with some wheat, and citrus hops.  This is a little hoppy for most wheat beers that I normally enjoy, but it worked well.  Kudos to CCB.","Florida, USA","burg326"
