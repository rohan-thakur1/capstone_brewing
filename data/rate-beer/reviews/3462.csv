3462,"2017-01-16",3.4,"Yields a coal black color with a huge, creamy dark brown head.

Smells of sweet cold brew coffee, lots of milk chocolate and just a little hint of roast. Molasses and spicy licorice mingle into this foundation, producing a milk chocolate powder aroma.

Has a thinner, velvet mouthfeel, with flavors ranging from sweet to dry, without a lot of nuances in between, tied together by a lower carbonation. 

Tastes of rock sugar and hot chocolate, molasses, surprisingly thin on the palate, with a slowly evolving coffee dryness. Once the coffee takes over, this begins to taste interesting, bringing flavors of dried herbs, earth, wood bark and sugared espresso beans to the palate, pungent and harmonious. Finishes bitter, bready and rustic, with its initial silkness.

If it wasn¬ít for the thin mouthfeel, with just a little more complexity to it, the beer could become mighty fine. As it stands, there is quite a bit unused potential to be found in here.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Drove out of my way after seeing Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Speedway Stout was on tap downtown at Monkey Paw. Turns out it was just the regular version. Still might have made the trip regardless. Really looking forward to this one as the taster I tried over the summer at AleSmith was really good.

Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of dark, khaki tan, frothy head when I got it. Great amount of circular spiderwweb lacing on the sides of the glass. Above average retention on the top all the way down. (Sight - 4.25)

Smelled dark espresso, toffee, caramel, chocolate milk, smooth coffee malts, dark chocolate and some cocoa. (Smell - 4.25)

Tasted smooth chocolate, roasted coffee beans, so much smoother than the Kona variant, Mudslide cocktail, vanilla, dark espresso, chocolate milk, hot chocolate, cocoa syrup, caramel and toffee. Tasted nowhere near 12 percent alcohol. (Taste - 4.75)

Full body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 4.50)

This was just as good as I hoped with a full review. Can¬ít wait to try the barrel-aged version. Probably my favorite Speedway Stout variant, although I need to try a non-hot BBA version. (Overall - 4.50)

While nothing short of excellent this version pales in comparison to the original. Something about the way that it amps up the coffee profile to an extreme unbalances the results just a little. I¬íd still drink it if offered but it just goes to show that quantity does not always mean quality.

Aroma / Appearance - A long boozy sheet of ice slides downwards in the same oily black core that is present in all Speedway variants. Black coffee, a splash of creamer, and little else densely hang in the air like a thick morning fog.

Flavor / Palate - Coffee, creamer, and hazel warm the throat. The sweetness that carries into a malty finish makes it different than your average version. With a little more balance it could be more than a slightly above average imperial stout. If you¬íve got the choice save your money and choose a different variant.

Absolutely ridiculous nose on this beer. Tons of perfectly roasted gourmet coffee along with lactose cream, condensed milk and sweet fudge-y chocolate malt. Deeply roasted with tons of coffee character but never approaches smelling burnt or acrid. Holy shit this beer smells good! 

Medium bodied with slight viscosity and really nice roasted black coffee/espresso bean flavor countered by sweet lactose creaminess and dessert like chocolate malt. Burnt toast and robust gourmet coffee flavor with oatmeal and bittersweet dark chocolate. That lactose presence is really, really nice and is very reminiscent of the condensed milk on the bottom of a cup of Vietnamese coffee. Well balanced but still roasty as hell.

3462,"2015-10-31",3.0,"UPDATED: NOV 12, 2015 Draught at Publick House, 10/26/15.Seemingly opaque ebony. Light tan head atop is small but quite well-retained.Vanilla, creamy-sweet sugars and plentiful coffee in the nose definitely makes a pretty true impression of a Vietnamese coffee. Sweet, but not too much so, with dry vanilla, lightly roasted coffee and some alcohol dryness as well. I guess you could say, what it lacks in complexity it makes up for in sheer strength. Down to the last drop it¬ís enjoyably sniffable, though the alcohol really gets quite assertive as it warms and breathes, unsurprisingly.The flavor is a much different beast. Where I was expecting a creamy-sweet, rich vanilla and chocolate flavored coffee character, based on the nose, it¬ís quite a bit dissimilar to that. Dry, very liquorous, and just outrageously boozy. The alcohol cuts at the palate to the point of astringency, highlighting the bitter roast, dry vanilla and such. Sweetness, quite fleeting, comes in the form of light caramel and sweet chocolate, but even with warming, it never achieves a balance. I love a dry beer, but with this level of alcohol, it just needs more malt sweetness to balance. I don¬ít remember Speedway being this damned boozy and I even just had a 2013 BA Speedway about six months ago, which was out of this world and far less boozy than this. The texture is competent, with tight carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel with some oiliness/slickness from the roasted malts and coffee. Even taking about 20 minutes to finish a 10 ounce glass, it still took a lot of effort to drink.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3462,"2015-06-28",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 12, 2015 Re-rated. 750 mL bottle shared by Gus at his tasting. The pour is equal, with a lesser head. The aroma is much better. Good coffee and roast with a nice solid licorice backing it up. A little boozy. The flavor is good. Nice chocolate and hints of vanilla throughout. As Gus would say,
""I¬ím happy I put this in my mouth."" The mouth feel is a little lighter than I was hoping with a nice thick carbonation and a good lingeringly chocolatey finish. Really good. Original rating - 750 mL bottle shared with ebone1988. The pour is a dark oily black with a large, way too large, fluffy dark khaki colored head and some solid lacing. The aroma is incredibly disappointing. It¬ís got a metallic aspect that seems to dominate it. Behind it I can pick up some roasted malts and a licorice bitterness, but there isn¬ít any coffee which is just a sad thing. The flavor is incredibly disappointing as well. There is a lot of chocolate and roasted malt. Decent licorice carries and there is a light metallic twinge on the finish. The mouth feel is light, the amount of head didn¬ít translate to carbonation level and the aftertaste is roasty chocolate malt with a light metallic hit. I believe there is something wrong with this bottle.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3462,"2015-06-25",4.4,"32 oz. growler poured into a snifter. Inky black. Good dark khaki head. Settles to a collar. Intense coffee. Initially seems to be the same a regular Speedway, but it has a lighter almost fruity characteristic to the coffee. The coffee has a much lighter and intense flavor than the other variants that I¬íve had. This one is less earthy and more fruity. Roasty malts and bitterness at the end. Light, but present, caramel malt flavor. Roasty and bitter. Well carbonated. Medium -heavy body. As heavy as it should be. The coffee is interesting and a surprisingly unique flavor. I figured this would taste the same as regular Speedway. The perceived delicacy of the coffee flavor means the depth of the coffee and malt flavor suffers a skosh, but I enjoy it just as much as regular Speedway.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

I have not had Vietnamese coffee before, but this blend comes off with more smooth and creamy sweet sugars--almost like a lactose addition, though I know it has been confirmed there is not lactose added here--and vanilla than big bold spicy coffee notes.

A - Pours jet black with a nice one finger tall tan head, quickly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small streaks of lace down the sides of the glass.


S - Smells of intense fresh brewed coffee, bit of bakers chocolate, dash of vanilla extract, molasses, dark fruits, plenty of dark roast and some light booze. The coffee is intense and yet it doesn¬ít completely overshadow the supporting aromas.


T - Starts off with with a huge blast of fresh brewed vietnamese coffee that never really fades away. Hints of vanilla, molasses, bakers chocolate, dark fruits and plenty of dark roast help round it all out. Booze grows as it warms up but never really gets in the way of the flavors. Finish is pretty roasty with a bit of sweetness, lingering long after the finish.


M - Heavy body with moderate carbonation. Heavy, roasty feel from start to finish. Pretty easy to consume all things considered.


O - I have wanted to try this one for a long time and I am really glad it lived up to my expectations. The coffee was stronger than the Kopi version which was a pleasant surprise, yet it was still pretty easy to consume.

3462,"2014-01-06",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2014 Bottle: Essentially a fully black pour with only the very edges showing signs of deep, deep brown. Fluffy, thick, chunky mocha head sits on top & slowly recedes leaving some nice webbing in its path. Aroma is magnificent & carries that signature Speedway smell. Lots of different coffee aromas in this one, though. Roasty, creamy, sweet, smooth, & robust, all at once. Notes of cream & sugar (from the lactose, I assume), roasted coffee beans, faint charred espresso, & even a light fruitiness as it warms up - perhaps black cherry-esque? Hints of cocoa in the back with lighter reminders of brown sugar & even caramelized sugar. The taste is roasted up front, with a light undertaking of creamy sweetness that crescendos into the finale. Faint vanilla, brown sugar, some bittersweet & dark chocolate with an aftertaste that¬ís both roasted & sweet for balance. Lightly acrid at times, but never overbearing. Gets a little sweeter with warmth, also a little boozier, but nothing too bad for 12% ABV. Another great addition to the Speedway series... Not my favorite, but damn good nonetheless.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

The spice level is also expectedly amped up, with strong hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. While those spices are often used for Xmas and pumpkin beers, the heavy coffee flavor of this beer keeps them grounded in a non-seasonal profile. Good stuff.

Aroma is full of rich creamy coffee with hints of vanilla, chocolate and roast. As it warns there is a faint hint of alcohol heat. I¬ím amazed how creamy this is without adding lactose. 
Pour is black with a slightly thin tan head that recedes fairly quickly. No lacing and moderate legs. 
Flavor is full of rich chocolate with really nice coffee character. The coffee is really creamy and is not vegetal at all. Alcohol more apparent as it warms with some light bitterness. Lingering alcohol, coffee and chocolate.
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium low carbonation. Very low astringency, somewhat surprising considering the style of beer. Low alcohol warmth.
Overall an amazingly enjoyable coffee stout. Most likely my favorite coffee stout I have tried. The coffee is so rich and creamy without being astringent, vegetal or green. This beer is what other coffee stouts should strive for.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

3462,"2013-05-31",3.7,"Growler filled last week, pill-bottle slightly leaky enjoyed in a tulip at 55F

A -  Almost midnight black, Nice 1 finger brown head that fades slowly to a nice rack of lacing.

S - Roasted milk chocolate, very earthy - nutty aroma of old espresso beans. Not bright and fruity, just earthy, dark, malty and big aroma of a latte that¬ís sat out for a few hours but still smells nice. It may just be the Vietnamese coffee is not bright like latin american or african beans are

T -  Well, it¬ís most certainly a speedway stout. Big chocolate and roasted coconut along with some vanilla. The coffee is good but it¬ís very old, tannic, acidic, bitter and sort of like cough syrup in the middle and finish. This alone is a turn off. Everything else about speedway really shines but the coffee used in this actually takes away from a great stout.

M - Heavy body, low carbonation (of course due to leakage). Dry and stringent boozy finish.

O - It¬ís easy to get caught up in hype and the fact I¬ím reviewing this as it¬ís currently #50 on the top beers list for RateBeer. Don¬ít misunderstand, it¬ís a great tasting stout but it¬ís not a top 50 stout. A solid 4 but I just can¬ít rate it higher and it could be the coffee type used but it is a coffee stout so I guess that¬ís part of the problem.

In fact I know the growler lost some carbonation but the mouthfeel is heavy on the alcohol which detracts from the nice coffee flavors. Lots of lactose sugar notes.

3462,"2013-05-25",4.5,"Poured into a snifter from a 32 oz. growler. Huge thanks to anotherjoe for this.

4.5 A: Black color. Two fingers of mainly cream, minorly frothy tan head. Retention is pretty good given the ABV and plenty of lacing is left, which is impressive given the coffee.

5.0 S: This smells amazing. I can¬ít really remember what the regular Speedway smells like at the moment, but I¬ím just going to say that this is different and better. The coffee is sweeter and more chocolatety. Supple roast, caramel, light molasses, chocolate, sweet neutral maltiness. Big pithy coconut, vanilla, and a lactose-like creaminess. 

4.5 T: Tastes mainly like the nose, but isn¬ít quite as powerful and impressive. Chocolate, roastiness, neutral maltiness, caramel, molasses, coconut, lactose, coconut, vanilla. Coffee is tangy, super smooth, chocolatety, and wonderfully roasty. Quite tasty.

4.0 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Super smooth and goes down incredibly easy. My only complaint is that it¬ís not quite creamy enough. Still good here though.

4.5 D: Definitely a winner. I love the original Speedway, but wasn¬ít impressed with the barrel aged version, but now I¬ím all about trying variants of this again.

Flavor is less pronounced than the nose, cinnamon sugar graham crackers, light roast, and a finish like a watered down iced americano.  I have always loved speedway so this was a
Real treat.  I'm gonna give this beer the benefit of the doubt in terms of palate and appearance scores and round up each 1 point from what id give it if it had been a fresh sample.  Will rerate if possible.

3462,"2012-09-17",4.7,"Excellent, super smooth version of speedway.  Coffee is less bitter, very smooth with hazelnut and chocolate flavors.  Aroma is fantastic.  Goes down way too easy for the alcohol.  It¬ís thick and rich and fantastically easy to drink a super huge beer.","Bethesda, Maryland, USA","dbarnold"
3462,"2012-09-15",4.1,"Winter 2011 - This is the third version of of the Speedway Stout I¬íve sampled. The first was the original. Second came the Speedway Stout with BA blend. Now is time for the Vietnamese coffee, which I¬ím hoping will brighten up an otherwise dark and oily palate. The aroma smells similar. So similar in fact that between these bold and brooding beers I can¬ít pick out a significant difference. However, the flavor is noticeably softer, and sweeter like a Thai iced tea. Its creamier, with a discrete sweetness I find most familiar in milk stouts. There¬ís also a heavier emphasis on a dark chocolate flavor, 80% plus, and trickling throughout the flavor sensation. It¬ís amazing, but they just keep making the Speedway Stout better and better. What¬ís next in the list of permutations for this hallmark brew?","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
3462,"2012-08-29",4.2,"Black in color with a finger of khaki colored head. Super strong and rich coffee aroma to this. Strong creaminess in te form of chocolate, a light vanilla note, and a good roasted malt character. Light graham cracker sweetness to it as well. The coffee really dominates the flavor as well. A touch of ash, lots of roast, and some bitter dark chocolate. Not as sweet as the nose, but nice toffee and molasses flavor.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3462,"2012-08-12",4.5,"On tap at the brewery. Pours black with a small tan head. Aroma of rich roasty coffee, dark chocolate, espresso, some dark fruit and a sweet cocoa. Flavor has much the same, very rich chocolate and sweet cocoa, the coffee really adds a nice new level to an already very good beer. Full body and a soft carbonation. Excellent","Chicago, Illinois, USA","FunkyBrewster"
3462,"2012-08-03",4.6,"This stout looks and smells like the other speedway versions since all contain coffee, but the Vietnamese coffee adds a really nice flavor not in the others. This was a cask version that had a well balanced carbonation level. Coffee is prominent with a very good contrast to the chocolate and roasted flavors. Best coffee adddition. Wish this was available in the bottle.","LAS VEGAS, Nevada, USA","kathouse"
3462,"2012-08-01",3.7,"Tasted at the alesmith tasting room.  Jet black with little head, this tastes just like the standard speedway stout to me. ie. damn good!","TAIWAN","mephisto"
3462,"2012-07-28",4.3,"On draught and cask at Alesmith.  Pours near black with an espresso head.  Cask engine pour holds the head beautifully.  Aroma has coffee, cocoa a bit of spiciness. I""m told its feom the chicory.  Nice.  It has a kick from it.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","dcschiller"
3462,"2012-05-08",4.0,"On tap at the brewery (along side Kopi Speedway, Regular Speedway and a cask of Barrel Aged Speedway). Rating #6400. Pours with a pitch black hued body with a lasting tan head. Full duration, great lace, glass (...err, cup) coating body. Aromas are of coffee, cocoa, earthy, leather, lactose, light esters, fudge  and vanilla. Flavors are of lactose, leather, strong and slightly gritty coffee flavors, cocoa, chocolate, earthy and nutty. As always with speedway, the Alcohol is well hidden. Medium carbonation, velvety body. Always fun to try a new variation of Speedway, especially in Alesmith¬ís new and fancy looking tap room.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
3462,"2012-04-26",4.1,"On tap at brewery.  Pours just shy of pitch black with a creamy layer of brown foam.  Aroma of arabica coffee with dusty and acidic notes along with toasted wet malts and creamy dark chocolate.  Flavor of fudge brownie, dark roasted cocoa powder, dry earthy dark coffee, and anise.  A distinct coffee bitterness (like tasting the grounds) in the finish.  Like all versions of Speedway, this hides the huge ABV very well.  Well done, but having been to Vietnam on three separate occasions (for a total of more than three months), I didn¬ít find the coffee aspect so ""Vietnamese.""  I guess I think of the coffee prepared the traditional way -- made with a little tin apparatus that sits atop your glass.  The coffee is intensely strong and brewed directly over a thick layer of sweetened condensed milk which takes some of the edge off.  I guess I expected the super-intense coffee flavor (and perhaps the sweetness of the real Vietnamese coffee?).  Still very good as all of these Speedway variants are.

3462,"2012-04-20",4.3,"Draught @ AleSmith. Black pour, coffee head. Strong coffee notes. Layered bitterness - first in the front of the mouth, a wave throughout the palate towards the end. Chocolate, roasty. Slick, oily mouthfeel. Long sustain. Significantly differentiated variation of the source beer.","","aleph"
3462,"2012-04-13",4.4,"This variant was definitely sweeter than the original and the coffee wasn¬ít as prominent in my opinion.  Still a great beer as all the Speedway Variants are.","San Diego, California, USA","Vac"
3462,"2012-04-06",4.8,"On tap at the brewery: The familiar, awesome strong coffee, dark chocolate Speedway with a hint of chicory, a full creamy mouthfeel and a lingering chicory/coffee bitter sweet finish..","San Diego (Mira Mesa), California, USA","papajohn"
3462,"2012-04-04",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 5, 2012 On tap at brewery. Black with dense brown head. Nose coffee and sweet roast malt. Sticky. Taste is huge. Big sweet pungent coffee. Long and strong bitter back. Coffee and cocoa. Gooey as hell. Dry cocoa palate in finish. Rerating up from 4.1.  Just super rich and thick, sharp and smooth and gooey all at the same time.","San Diego, California, USA","Lagunitasfan"

Dark toasty malts, light sweetness, touch of dark fruit, light bitterness, and creamy body.

3462,"2011-11-19",4.3,"Served on tap at O¬íbrien¬ís Night of a Million Zillion Speedways 2011. The appearance is the usual Speedway deep black hue with a medium roasty brown head. The aromas are full of rich roasted coffee that has a mild spice edge. The flavors are a rich sweet and lightly spice coffee, oily, some chocolate too. The mouth is full with a bit more carbonation feel then creaminess because of the spice maybe. I¬ím not so sure I have ever knowingly had Vietnamese coffee but after this it is time to find some.","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"
