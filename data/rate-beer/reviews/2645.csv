2645,"2017-03-12",3.4,"I bought this bottle in the Edenka supermarket in Freiburg. I drank it yesterday in the flat, in Freiburg. In my point of view, it is an average kristallbier, nothing exciting but it makes the job to be refresh. The taste is with wheat, some malt, bready, banana, some hop, if I compare with a hefe-weizen, the taste
is a bit more crispy and not so sweet, I observe this small point.","Lausanne/Sevilla/Lima, SWITZERLAND","caribou43"

Slightly sweet and slightly acidic malt aroma with a little wheat-character and a fruity touch of overripe citrus-fruits. Light-sweet and acidic flavour, light to medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Slim malty base, which feels a bit empty, especially towards the finish; rudimental fruity accents and a touch of nutmeg, but nothing more. Rather disappointing as the whole style.","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"
