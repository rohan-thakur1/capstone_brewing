264,"2017-02-04",4.7,"I had the Nigori version, which was significantly less in alcohol content (8% I believe). It was still worth it for the amazing flavor.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","bpreo"
264,"2016-09-18",3.0,"Subtle flavors of melon and rice with similar smells as well. Quite a light sake for the style. Nicely inexpensive. Pretty good though not amazing.","Fair Lawn, New Jersey, USA","KoRoBeNiKi"
264,"2016-08-26",3.5,"SoThis is probably the 2nd or 3rd sake Ive had and I have no knowledge at all of whether this is per style. That said, I enjoyed this . Had cold, almost no aroma, very clear color, like water. The finish is a little weird but its pretty easy to drink. Excited to try some others at our new sushi place.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"

264,"2016-02-28",3.8,"Some of the more delicious saké I have tried recently; enjoyed a bottle of this paired with a couple different meals from standard fried rice with seaweed to tuna steaks, very versatile in pairing. Slightly grainy yellow color, aroma of mango and sweet alcohol. Medium-bodied with an excellent full flavor of fruit and rice-grain, peppery agave finish. Very prominent alcohol tinge throughout, but not in an offensive way. Overall quite enjoyable.","South Carolina, USA","eRock_2013"
264,"2015-03-28",3.4,"Bottle thanks to Yuriko. Clear pour with good legs. Sampled with Dassai 50 and Dassai 23 for comparison. This was the harshest of the bunch, but still quite smooth and drinkable compared to other sakes ive had before. Slightly fruity and apple notes, and what I would have described as clean if I had not had the others for comparison. Slight burning as it goes down, but very faint. Enjoyable, but I still prefer nigori or the Junmai Daiginjo.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Butters"
264,"2013-11-18",3.6,"Pour out of bottle, clear straw yellow with no head, aroma brought grass, rice, hints of peach, pear, nice earthy, oaky tones, touch of sweet orange as well. Taste is sweet orange, grape, peach, some hints of tropical fruits into some rice, earth, slight spice notes, finishing sweet. Pretty nice.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
264,"2012-11-20",3.3,"Bottle shared by bhensonb. Pours clear white with a subtle melon-like aroma. Its very dry with a delicate rice and melon flavor.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
264,"2012-11-04",3.2,"Bottle from World Market. Pours rather perry color. Aroma is clean, no fusils, and there are hints of plum and/or green melon. Med body or nearly. The flavor is very clean for a sake, and the fruit is decent. Smooth, dry and clean. Rivals a decent chardonnay.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
264,"2012-10-18",3.3,"Bottle. Pours clear, nice legs. Aroma of light fruit and melon. Flavor seems a bit dumbed down but pleasant, very slight butter. medium mouthfeel. Nice.","Mata Gorda, Texas, USA","SphinxTX"
264,"2012-10-07",3.3,"Clear without any trace of color.  Aroma of grapes, faint alcohol.  Tastes of alcohol and faint tree fruit flavors.  Intersting, but again, Im not a sake guy.","State College, Pennsylvania, USA","can8ianben"
264,"2012-09-29",3.0,"Bottle. Pours with a clear hued body with some legs. Aromas are of lychee, nutty, marzipan, a bit meaty, koji, minerals, peanut butter, melon. Flavors are nutty, melon, umami, medium mineral, warming, honey, biscuit like starch character. Some floral notes that could just be alcohol byproducts. Big and viscous mouthfeel.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
264,"2012-08-03",2.8,"(750ml bottle, courtesy of BMan1113VR)  Pours a transparent body with nice legs.  Aroma of vanilla, florals, Styrofoam, melon rind, and marzipan.  Flavor of florals, marzipan, and rice.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
264,"2012-03-05",3.2,"bottle pour.  more of the typical muddled yogurt yeast, creamed rice and fruit cocktail / canned pear flavor and syrupiness. moderately rough with plastic and ethanol notes growing too strong late.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
264,"2011-10-13",2.8,"Butterscotch and vanilla creme nose. Clear, yellowish. honey and cantaloupe flavor, only slightly buttery. Very hot. Finishes more like honeydew melons.Somewhat mead-like actually for a sake, but has definite melon characteristics. Surprising complexity.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
264,"2011-06-21",3.0,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2011 Light yellow. Musky, melons, banana aromas. Flavor is lightly sweet, somewhat fruity and a bit dank.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
264,"2011-03-19",3.4,"750, screwtop. Chilled at Izumi. Clear pale gold. For me, sake is always so light. Such subdued flavors...and this one is no different. There is lemon, and maybe a mild mossy note, and a tiny bit of salt air tanginess. Delicious and drinkable.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
264,"2010-10-16",3.1,"Bottle. Pours a clear color more of less. Water like mouthfeel. Notes of fresh linen, sugar cane, and berries. Simple.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
264,"2009-01-28",3.3,"Served Warm at Noodles at Bellagio.  Sharp sweet nose yellowish pour taste sweet tasty I admittedly no nothing about sake ratings, but i thought this was pretty good.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
264,"2008-11-19",2.7,"Clear and still, with a light, dusty tint and a watery consistency.  It almost looks like dirty tap water.  I don’t often deviate from a ""3"" for sake appearance, but this one is on the ugly side of normal.  The aroma is sweet, almost like a dessert beverage, showing notes of cream, mild koji, green melon, and honeydew.  Flavors follow suit, showing sweet cream, alcohol soaked melon, and rice pudding.  The palate is watery, with a searing, alcoholic burn.  There’s not a whole lot of positives to speak of here.  I’m not impressed.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
264,"2008-07-23",2.9,"Clear.  Straightforward woody, koji aroma with a hint of pear.  The body is smooth, light, with a splash of acidity.  Fairly light, vibrant, toasty, some juicy-citrusy notes.  Not sure I like how it dies in the finish, though.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
264,"2008-04-23",2.9,"Pour is clear with light yellow...faint sweet floral aroma with some alcohol...sweet flral flavor with lots of sweet alcohol...","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"
264,"2007-11-17",2.8,"Thanks to David for bringing the bottle!  Poured clear, almost water-like with a faint yellow tint to it.. short, but well-formed legs on the glass.  The aroma was very upfront with rougher rice notes and some medium-skinned fruits.. a bit crass, but not bad.  The flavor had harsher alcohol-fueled peach notes with somehow sweetened rice.. left a long, brash finish.  Slick on the palate, finishing with an ugly feel on the finish.  Thanks David!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
264,"2007-11-03",3.5,"1.8 L bottle - boy thats a big one.  Aroma is of nail polish remover, apples and peach.  A nice punch of flavor, pretty sweet at first, but balanced by a dry peppery finish.  No off tastes, just simple and delicious, nothing special but a crowd pleaser. Anything but refined, this sake is quite good warm.  Although sweeter at higher temperatures, many more flavors become evident and the finish comes out well.  Overall, I recommend given the low pricepoint and originality.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","jlf278"
264,"2007-10-08",3.2,"10/6/07 at Sushi.com in Spokane, Wa.  Aroma is a slightly meaty scent with a sour rice wash note, similar to the rinse that comes off of rice grains you are cleaning.  Appearance has a very faint light green tinge, noticed this on the white glasses.  Flavor is slightly resiny, with a creamy flavor. I didnt consider it very sweet, but my wife liked the sweetness, a lot, so that might appeal to some.","Renton, Washington, USA","Bradrcr"
264,"2007-02-11",2.2,"300mL Bottle: An off beige clear color with thick legs. The nose is ripe with rice and koji, light alcohol and a dusty peach and granite. The flavor is sharp, lots of dry acidity and bitterness, but the alcohol is still in check. This is fairly good if you consider how its made and how this ""style"" of sake tastes. A good piece of history in each bottle, the taste tells you why they dont really do this type of sake anymore though. Funny that it would ever be used as a house sake with such intensive labor required for this brewing method. The tail is chalky and long. Fairly bad, but light alcohol, if thats something worth noting.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
264,"2005-02-19",1.6,"Extremely rough and crude.  This is the ""house sake"" at a local Japanese restaurant, and its cheap.  Now I know why.  Interestingly, this sake is made using the traditional Kimoto method, which is extremely rare and once was its own style on RateBeer until Senor Admin came to his senses.  Harshly alcoholic, this junmai is like getting punched in the face, but still is better than a glass of Futsu-shu.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
264,"2004-05-22",3.3,"Aroma is pear and lemons. Appearance is a clear yellowish color. Flavor is somewhat sour with a bite of citrus and vanilla. Aftertaste is slightly sweet. This has a little more flavor than some sake Ive had.","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
264,"2004-03-09",2.9,"Slightly dirty water color. Tall legs, but not very attractive. Light plum, vanilla and coconut milk, with the typical undetone of alcohol in the aroma. Light gin flavors with a initial dirty grain start. Alcohol does not seem to serve a purpose.  Not warming or very flavorful. Just ""alcohol"". Late finish of mild coconut.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
