1239,"2014-09-08",3.7,"Reviewing a doppelbock at the end of summer might not be a completely fair review. However, I have had Spaten Optimator many times in the past and its only been slightly better than the bottle Im reviewing now. This is definitely a German doppelbock personified  plenty of sweet malty notes, slightly nutty, but some bitterness to balance it out. Not bad for an InBev product.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a mug. It was bottled on 2/2/14 and cost $2.50 ($0.21 per ounce).

Appearance: Beautiful chestnut/mahogany hue. Translucent with carbonation visible. Pours to a two-finger, tan, foamy head which laces and retains somewhat well.

Smell: Slight skunkiness from the green bottle; otherwise very malty with an overt lager character.

Taste: The first thing I notice here is the classic macro lager character. While Im quite sure Spaten Optimator is an all-malt brew, theres something to it that screams lager! as soon as it touches the tongue. Its actually quite tangy at first, maybe even a little sour (Im chalking that up to green bottle and lightstrike), but its easily overlooked. Once I get invested in the palette I start to notice flavors of roasted peanuts, a touch of caramel, maybe toffee. The doppelbock style is actually not too far off from the brown ale style in terms of flavor characteristics and this beer is a good example of that. Theres still some bitterness here, but actual hop flavor is mild. Slightly dry, maybe even a bit metallic. Again, this is a fairly old bottle, so Ill bet a fresh serving would be more complex and less flawed, but as it stands its still pretty good for a relatively inexpensive import made by a macro brewery.

Drinkability: Spaten Optimator may taste like and ale, but it drinks like the lager it is. The mouthfeel is thin and crisp, but not overly fizzy. Theres a slightly slick or sour aftertaste, but I dont mind it. At 7.6% ABV there is mild warmth from the alcohol, and it does play a factor in the taste as well. It doesnt feel as heavy as those numbers would indicate, but one serving is satisfactory to be sure.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Once you get this doppelbock out of the shitty green bottle it has a seductive dark body with a generous tan head. The aroma consists of warm booze and fruity, complex malt tones. The flavor is rich and slightly roasty at the start. At the middle of the mouth, theres a hell of a lot going on - candy-like sweetness, dark fruit, toffee, chocolate - its all there. Finish is a little spicy which is nice because it helps to offset the maltiness. I was very impressed by the variety of aromas and tastes that this lager had to offer.

Very bitter on the back of the palate, theres something lacking the balance of the beer. If the beer tasted more like the sweet, somewhat roasty front end and less like the needlessly bitter back, it would be a very good beer.

Poured from bottle into pint glass

Appearance  Pours a brown with a big billowy off white head. The head fades to a thin film, with some nice lacing on the glass.
Smell  Bready and sweet, with a heavy roasted malt aroma mixed with quite a bit of caramel.

Taste  Bready with a roasted malt flavor initially. This is soon met with some sweet brown sugar and caramel flavors in the middle of the taste. The sweetness intensifies at the taste experience advances with it leaving a very pleasant sugar flavor on the tongue as the last drops of the beer work their way down your throat. A nice dopplebock flavor.

Mouthfeel The body is creamy and the carbonation is quite right. The body of the beer coats the mouth without too much stickiness; making it very drinkable. The carbonation only enhances the drinkability; it complements the thicker-smooth body with a lighter carbonation which tingles the tongue in just the right way. 

Overall  Very drinkable and enjoyable. A classic dopplebock in my opinion.","","Darkmagus82"

1239,"2012-09-08",3.5,"Roasty malt aroma yielding to toasted brown sugar and bock yeast. Taste is similar, but more rich and sweet raisin fruitiness than the nose emits. Good doppelbock yeast tang balances the sweetness of the malt. Not heavy or syrupy on the palate, so relatively easy to drink. This is about the nth time Ive had this beer, but in tasting it for the purposes of rating, Im noticing a slight sourness very near the end of the finish that I hadnt thought about before. Not sure if the bottle (purchased at a Safeway grocery in California, USA) was mistreated, or if I just hadnt noticed it before.

The malts are extremely prominent: rich and toasty, with caramel and molasses overtones, and a hint of dark, brown bread on the finish.  A moderate carbonation level doesnt quite eclipse the dash of bitter that sets off the malty sweetness very nicely.  Its very very assertive, but not cloying in terms of sweetness.

1239,"2012-04-09",3.2,"A: Pours a dark brown color that turns ruby red when put up to the light. The head is a three-finger light mocha color with mediocre retention/lacing.

S: Honestly, it smells a little skunky. There is a bit of maltiness and hop character, but the skunk (sadly) wins out. Seriously, brewers, STOP USING GREEN BOTTLES!

T: Thankfully, not nearly as skunky as the nose. Opens up with flavors of toffee, molasses, and roasty malts, but finishes a zesty hop bite. Theres the faintest hint of booze on both the back end and going down the throat, but its well hidden otherwise. Not an easy beer to drink, but decently flavorful.

M: The carbonation starts off intense, but fades rather quickly. Im only halfway through the beer and its already (nearly) flat. In addition, while its decently thick, it isnt creamy enough to counteract the fading carbonation. Otherwise, it isnt bad at all on the palate.

O: Im a bit conflicted on this one. I like the way it tastes, but I dont like the skunk profile I get on the nose. Eh, what the hell, give it a shot, its well priced for a rather big beer.

1239,"2012-02-29",3.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/29/2010.  On tap in a pint glass.

At first glance, the color is black, but upon further inspection it is lightly transparent ruby throughout. Nice creamy foamy off-white head. Foamy lace drips forms and drips away down the glass.

Molasses, roasted malt, and ripe dark fruits comprise the aroma. A touch of spice wafts into the nose as well.

Molasses, plums, raisins, a light general spiciness - all spice or nutmeg maybe. Along with a roasted malt, these flavors form the basis of the flavor. Earthy hops sneak up on me, making themselves known as the sip comes to a close. Finishes lightly bitter. 

The carbonation fizzes and bubbles away in my mouth, eventually relenting to a creamy feel. Lightly sticky, with above average carbonation wrapped in a fuller than medium body.

Although I am not usually a lager person, I have been getting more into Doppelbocks recently, and this is a nice example of the style. Really drinkable at 7.2%. Definitely better as it warms.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Medium bodied, moderate coarse carbonation in the mouthfeel.  Yeah, the caramel isnt dominating the flavor either, its moderate and balanced with a considerable amount of easy-going noble hop flavor and bitterness.  Hmmm.

A - Deeper amber color, but for the style it is a little light. Smaller than average sized, foamy, creamy, off-white head. Disappears pretty fast with a thin ring of lace.

S - Slightly burnt caramel and carob. Plenty of sweet dark fruit, especially raisin along with a plumy aroma and slightly jamy. Some dark, sweet bready malt as well. Some fruity, apple along with a hint of alcohol.

T - Like the nose, there is a good amount of dark fruit with raisin and a plumy flavor as well as a touch of apple. Also a fair amount of molasses and carob. Quite malty and some dark, sweet bread along with some slightly torched caramel. A touch of nuttiness.

M - Lighter side of medium (pretty light for the style) with about average carbonation. Smooth and a touch creamy, but just a little too thin for my liking.

1239,"2010-01-03",2.8,"I am not a fan of Spaten; most of their beers are mediocre and I am standing by my opinion as such. The only beer of theirs I have supped so far that was respectable was their Premium Lager. Up to bat today is their Optimator, a German Doppelbock which I hope will also be respectable seeing as I enjoy doppelbocks in general.


He poured a deep dark mix of burgundies, browns, and mahogany while a thin khaki head quickly retreats into oblivion; a thin collar is all that remains.  Lifting the glass to my nose, a thick and syrupy assault of molasses and maple syrup weighs upon my senses. This isnt the finest of the finest; this is the artificially saturated syrup which comes in gallon jugs at a sleek price to appease all the non-discerning general public. Floating in that tub of sickenly thick and artificially sweet maple and molasses are raisins, prunes, cinnamon sticks, and sliced apples. At the back of his nose is a painful hit of alcohol heat. Already I feel my rather limited respect for Spaten in general and their Optimator specifically quickly spiraling into the usual pit of disappointment. My first quaff is sweet and surprisingly a touch dry, a fact his nose certainly didnt reveal. Dry cinnamon powder and brown sugar ground super-fine are most evident atop my tongue while his body is thick and heavy with artificially sweetened molasses and maple syrup. The further I quaff, a growing sense of staleness works its fingers into his palate much like a poison slowly spreading through the body of its victim. Stale breads such as rye and pumpernickel unfortunately linger in the background, growing ever more apparent as the maple and molasses also starts to go sour. It could also be that the sweetness is just so overwhelming, so heavy, so thick, and so dominating that I can only handle so much before my body starts to reject what I am apparently trying to torture it with. Ive tasted enough and I would rather the Spaten Optimator not come back later to haunt me. There are no fond farewells here, just an immediate exit strategy expertly executed.


What can I say but yet another disappointment from a brewery which I have very low expectations for anyway. If you come across any Spaten other than the lager, avoid it like the plague. No more need be said.

Taste/Mouth Feel: The flavor has a big sweet malty character and full body with notes of caramel roasted grain and toffee. Hop bitterness is very light and really only comes out a little bit in the finish. There is also the slight presence of a mellow alcohol that adds a little more complexity to the overall character.

Fantastic stylish beer. It sizzles my tongue and palate just a little bit, and the malt almost threatens to be a bit treacly but then it  kicks the right amount and shape of hops at me to keep the dynamic interplay of this beer so fascinating.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DerWeg"

1239,"2007-08-22",5.0,"Spaten Optimator is simply my favorite beer in the world. I was first referred to it by a friend in South Bend, Indiana since I had described what type of beer that I like and he thought that I might like this one. Optimator, to me, is a ""heavy"" beer (especially the bottled version) meaning that it is alcoholic and I personally can only drink two of them in an evening. 

The appearance is excellent. An amber ""body"" with a lighter orange, yellowish head. The smell is chocolatey and even is a bit like a mocha. Taste is even more like a mocha with a very dry middle taste but then a very pleasing smooth after taste. ""Mouthfeel"" which is something that I had not even thought of before is very good as Optimator is very smooth. To me, it is more like a meal in and of itself so if you are eating while drinking this then you will get very full very fast. 

Again, it is my favorite beer of all time. I drank the draft version at Chef Pauls Bavarian House in Lisle, Illinois while visiting with family there and I actually prefer the draft to the bottle since it is a bit lighter. I cannot say enough good things about Optimator.","Ohio, USA","adamette"

Little to no hop bitterness.  Carbonation is quite apparent on the palate, and it leaves a bit of a tingling sensation in the back of the throat for a few seconds after the swallow.

But this is not my main concern: as one drinks this more, an unpleasant character emerges, a sort of strong biting taste, a foul taste.

Quite tasty with a hint of alcohol on the exhale, this is a nice doppelbock, but its not even in the same league with Ayingers Celebrator.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"

But no, theres no such thing Spaten Dark, Spatens bock beers are all helles type, and Im sure this is too dark and the wrong season for an Oktoberfest, it must be Optimator.Body is indeed doppelbock dark, under a brown creamy head. Dark rich malt flavor, accented by a slight yeast bite. Comes across as creamy, perhaps a touch oversweet, but then with a slight milky sourness. Nice heady hit of alcohol.

One of my favorite amber colored beers.  If you are a fan of Oktoberfest/Maerzen give this a try.  Itll change your perspective.  At US$ 10.99/12-12oz bottles (same price as most German/Czech/Aussie/Mexican lagers) its a bargain.  Have a few and become one with the recliner.","USA","locarboy"

1239,"2006-10-14",3.2,"Bottle.  This beer was a dark ruby red pour, not opaque, and had a huge tan head, but which shrank to a thin film.  Sweet aroma of dark fruit.  Flavor of fruit again, specifically cherries, bread, some toffee in there I think, but flavor is not as sweet as the aroma would have you believe.  Medium body.  Warming alcohol in the finish.  Overall, too much flavor for me.  Needed some roast to balance it out.","Burbank, California, USA","mcnally"
1239,"2006-10-07",4.3,"Tipical doppel-bock appearence, off-white head with no longevity at all, very dark caramel color, almost no visible gas.
Also tipical is the strong body and a complex sweet aroma. Most-obvious touchs are of caramel and toffee. The taste is even stronger and although sweet, not as much as the aroma is. When drinking the rich mouthfull feeling reveals nuts and raisins. The body is very dense, a coffee biterness stay on the tongue, but with all its complexity, totally diferent from a dunkel or irish dark beer for example. Maybe too sweet for some ocasions, but still a very enjoyable strong beer. I had difficulties for feeling the alcohol on the taste (despite of its 7,2% ABV), what can be good for many people and for many ocasions even for me. Maybe not the number one, but still fantastic!!!","Niterói, BRAZIL","BrunoStehling"

A toffee and raisin hint kicks in during the body which moves into a lightly alcohol finish.  Medium bodied to syrupy.  Was really not roasty at all, for a doppelbock, or for how the market it.

1239,"2006-08-27",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2006 450th German.  Green bottle - ugh!  Nice double spade, at least.  Aroma is sweet, syrupy, sugary bock maltiness.  Light fruitiness.  Have to give it due, its potent.  Pours a rich dark ruby with a short, lacing tan head.  Strong visible carbonation.  Tastes mostly malty, though not syrupy as expected, with grape, red berry, and a little grit.  Crisp, medium-full bodied but finishes somewhat lighter.  Toffee and brown sugar in the dry aftertaste.  Could use additional hoppy bitterness to balance the malty sweetness, and even a little more body, but, hey now, this is still one of the better in style.  Its not on the level of the Andechser or the Ayinger (nowhere near as complex), probably closer to the Triumphator and the Salvator.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
1239,"2006-08-18",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 5, 2008 Color is dark amber with near-white head. Aroma is faint - some malt, some fruit, mostly yeasty. Flavor is a balance of malts, spicey hops, alcohol, and hints of something sour (not objectionably sour - perhaps not the freshest sample). Also slightly roasted, almost savory, flavors.  The beer feels cloying between the middle and the finish, but finally finishes somewhat dry. The body is heavily carbonated (even after a vigorous pour to release most of it).

Re-rate 1/4/2008: 50cl bottle. Poured a deep, clear, dark brown with amber/red highlights and a medium-sized tan head. The aroma was bready and very sweet with malts. There were also hints of caramel-covered fruit in the aroma. The flavor followed the aroma: very sweet and malty, very light level of bittering hops, and unexpectedly fruity. The fruit character really made the beer taste almost like a strong, malty, brown ale - but it was not objectionable, just unexpected from a German lager bier. The mouthful is full-bodied and well-carbonated. The carbonation was high enough to feel spritzy on the tip of the tongue, but creamy towards the middle and back of the palate. Overall, a more pleasant experience that I remember from last time (previous rating was a total score of 3.3 - Aroma, Palate, and Overall Impression each received an extra point, resulting in a new total of 3.6).","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

The palate is as smooth, firm, and mouth-fiiling as Pamela Andersons left breast. Fine, tingly carbonation dances on the tongue.

1239,"2006-03-07",3.7,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pilsner glass Optimator looked a reddish brown color when held up to a light. There was a tan head of about an inch with large bubbles in it.
My 1st whiff was beer! Must be some hops in there. After the 1st sniff all I could get was the malt and a very slight metallic smell.
The taste was malty and a bit sweet but not overly so. If you let it sit in your mouth too long youll get a metallic taste. The 7.2% ABV is not noticeable, so, this Doppelbock can sneak up on you and go Boo!

The mouth feel was a bit thin for something that is supposed to be full-bodied. It is smooth and very drinkable with sufficient carbonation.

This is the first Doppelbock I ever had. I had it on tap at the Village Corner in historic Stone Mountain Village, GA. I must say that I prefer it on tap.

1239,"2006-01-28",4.6,"I was happy to enjoy a Spaten Optimator at the Spatenhof which is the downtown Munich outlet for Spaten beers. This is a very well done example of dopple bock, and one that can be found in a number of US markets both in bottles and on draught. It can actually be found year round in the US, but I really enjoy this one during the cold, winter months, as a rich, hearty, malty lager to sit and relax with. 

Spaten Optimator pours to a beautiful, bright, chestnut color with a thick and creamy head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is rich and sweet with lots of big sweet malty, nutty, and toasty aromas with hints of peppery alcohol. The palate is rich and full on the tongue, with lots of big sweet malt, toast, and nut flavors, on a firm, polished body. Optimator finishes with more sweet malt and toasty flavors up front, then ends a bit cloying with more sweet malt, and a peppery alcohol burn that lingers. 

This is an delicious, very welll made example of dopple bock, and is a personal favorite of mine, though there are other examples that I enjoy more. I enjoy the fact that this beer, along with Paulaner Salvator is one the most accessible German dopples on the US market, and is a very good introduction to the style. It isnt the most impressive dopple bock I have sampled, but the Germans have set the bar very high on this particular style, so at the very least this beer can be called excellent. 

Optimator is a wonderful before or after dinner drink, and its sweet and toasty character makes it an ideal desert beer. At the Spatenhof, this beer was a phenomenal match to a dessert of Weissbier Creme, which was a delicious custard made with Franziskaner Weissbier served with fresh whipped cream, fruit and berries. It was to die for, and the sweet and malty Optimator really cut the tart wheat flavors of the weissebier cream, fruit, and berries.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

I had high expectations for this beer, since from my limited experiance German beers are quit tastey. Well, it let me down. The main thing for me was its high alcohol content, which made the flavor a little too strong for me. This paired with that darn bitter hops and well i just dont like the taste.

Appearance is dark reddish brown, translucent if held up to the light but opaque otherwise.  A small head develops on the pour that dissolves fairly quick, leaving a wafer-thin layer of foam on the beer for the remainder of the glass.  The flavor is like the aroma, sweet malt with a hint of roasting that floats right on the edge of detection.  A slight bitterness (very mild hops and again roastiness) surfaces after you swallow, and then disappears.  The palate is full and creamy, with mild carbonation that manifests itself in exquisite tiny bubbles.  An exceptional beer, and a great example of the traditional doppel.","Le Mars, Iowa, USA","bbrock81"

Tastes of dark malt, burnt malt flavors. Sweet and (again) malty. Molasses flavors with a light bitter finish. Feels thick on the palate. The taste kind of slides down the back of your throat like a raw oyster. Warming as it goes down.

Quite drinkable to me, especially when the weather gets to changing up here. Smooth enough to have on a regular basis and a solid doppelbock.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","lagermonkey"

1239,"2005-03-14",3.8,"Aroma is mild and wavering of dark caramel, slightly roasty toffee, dark cherry notes, and touches of molasses. 

Clear ruby-copper color up to the light, amongst the shadows it lurks as chestnut brown. Thin tan cap delevops late after the pour, surmounting down quickly to a very thin collar. Minimal spotty lacing which melts away.

Flavors are nice, starts a bit slow and wet but builds to some lightly chewy and medium richness of slender roasted caramel and toffee. Drops of sweet dark fruity things. Nice sticky finish of sweet caramel malts lingering.

Feel is about medium with a thicker sticking finish, a bit subdued and slim. Not as thick the whole way through nor as creamy as I wouldve liked to seen. This seemed just a bit weaker then I imagined it would be. Expectations sometimes are never met. Still good, just not great; so Id have this again.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Medium to dark amber, moderate to heavy viscosity and rich chocolate and caramel malts.  There have been several times when Ive had this one when the flavor hasnt been consistent and its been somewhat muted, taking on a more bubblegum flavor and deviating from the malt onslaught that I enjoy about this one, and hold it to each time.  At its best, this could be a 4.5 as a result of its fine use of caramel and chocolate malts to sweeten it to a brown sugar-laden liquid bread.

Smells strongly of molasses, sugar, and nice gentle, noble hops, some roasted vegetables. Smells like a Dopplebock. Initial taste is quite pleasant. Smooth and creamy across the palate, but not so much so that it bogs down my tongue. Rather delightful, with tastes of molasses and chocolate, coupled with a nice balancing bitterness. To me, this holds up with some of the better beers Ive had. Definitely drinkable and enjoyable, as the finish does not linger and the alcohol lets you know it is there.

The beer is malty sweet with a smooth finish that has a hint of dark malt character reminiscent of chocolate.   The beer is quite a bit more tasty than the aroma suggests.  Somewhat light on the palate, though only in so much as I was expecting it to be a bit thicker, it is actually about medium full in the body.

1239,"2004-07-23",4.0,"12 oz. green, longneck bottle. No freshness date noted, but none should be needed at this ABV. Poured out a dark amber, light brown color, with a short lived, tan colored head. It slid back to a thin ring of foam around the rim of the glass. Aromas are of easy roasted coffee, the kind you used to have on Saturday mornings.
Slight yeastiness, along with maltiness galore. It has the appearance of a fine, dark rum, as it is very clear. Tastes are of roasted malts, dark honey, some fruity notes, mainly figs, and dates. Very aromatic, and the aromas change as it warms slightly.
Medium thick mouthfeel is deceptive. Coats the tongue with maltiness, but never cloying. Finishes semi-sec, and with a note of hops in the final draw. A well made, if mainstream doppelbock.
Hides its alcohol very well. Deceptively drinkable.","","Cobra"
1239,"2004-07-18",3.7,"Reddish brown body is the color of cola with a fizzy beige head that is not around for very long.  The aroma is roasted cracked grains and dry fruits mixed with powdered chocolate.  The taste is sweetly malty, fruity (figs, raspberries, and apple), musty, and faintly smoky.  The flavors dont meld together quite well and mouthfeel is one step on the harsh side of creamy.  The alcohol is not well covered, but is not strong enough to be a distraction.  Hop bitterness is well in check, and only presents itself in the dry aftertaste.  A good deal at under $2 for a 500 ml. bottle at Greens on Buford Highway.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Liquid is clear, ""merlot"" colored in glass, dark brown with red enough to put it somewhere between cherry and mahogany.

As beer warms, it smells like bananas foster and cloves with intensely malty aroma bringing out the caramel from bananas foster(alcohol too).  Drinking this was very nice.

1239,"2004-03-25",3.4,"I think fellow Iowa City beer-meisters Heemer and HeyKevin pretty much hit it on the head in their reviews below. I was also disappointed in this. My little beer-loving soul made a tiny leap for joy when I walked into the beer room at John's today and saw cases of this on display. (Has this ever been available around here?) I managed to calm down enough to refrain first from springing for a case and then from picking up a six pack, choosing the cautious route of going with just a single bottle at $1.79 for sampling purposes. It's too sweet, not cloying like Sam Adams Double Bock, but just a hair's breadth away from that unpleasantness. It has a pretty good full mouthfeel, the kind you expect from an authentic German beer, but the taste just wasn't all that pleasant. Like Heemer, I think my first thought was also how nice it would be to find a cheaper version of Ayinger Celebrator. But the money spent on Celebrator is worth it. If nothing else, this beer has increased my appreciation for Celebrator, as well as for Kulmbacher Eisbock and Aventinus Weizen eisbock. As I think Heemer and HeyKevin note, there is indeed a certain sweaty sock smell/taste or sourness here that is a bit difficult to identify. Is it in the malt, the yeast? I notice this in just about everything by Spaten, though, even in their relatively more satisfying Oktoberfest-Ur-Marzen. It's a distinguishing characteristic about Spaten and an unpleasant one at that, not unlike a slightly skunked fake German beer like Becks or St. Pauli Girl. I'm glad I tried this, to satisfy my curiosity, but this isn't worth the 10 bucks a six pack it's going for at Johns. (Side note: at the same time I picked this up I also got a single of Capital's WInter Skål, because of the good things I've read lately about the beer and my own inability to remember exaclty what this tasted like. I was surprised to find that I liked the Capital bottle better than the Spaten doppelbock. Go figure.)","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","Gmku"

1239,"2004-03-19",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2004 I was let down by this one. After reading reviews and raves, I thought, great a cheaper way to get something along the lines of Celebrator.

1239,"2003-11-14",4.3,"Aroma: Rich crystal-choco malty tones with pleasing alcohol sweetness.  No hop aroma perceived.  On warming, there is plum, black current, then turning towards dried fruit, & I think I just want to crawl inside the glass!

Appearance: Very dark brown with ruby highlights & clear as one can tell.  Low tan head that persists & is creamy.  The carbonation is very fine & well-done.  Yum is an understatement!

Flavor: Rich semi-sweet choco-malty with hints of tobacco hop flavor.  Residual crystal-like sweetness approaching cloying but steering clear at the finish.  Definite alcohol warming.  A very faint acidic-fruity sherry character denoting of oxidation: I am impressed that this should be so well preserved from Safeway (well  I did grab from the very back of the shelf).  Bittering is enough to support the malt for the style & is not obvious.  On warming, the malt flavor slides more towards a light blend of molasses & not overtly heavy; even later this matures to raisin with a hint of diacetyl which I am willing to accept.

Mouthfeel is generously full & round with a nice creamy texture, moderate carbonation, & a hint of grain astringency that in my perception complements the delicate balance & supportive of the dominate malt signature.

Overall, this is another of my favorite styles & it is well represented in Spaten as oppose to Paulaner which has thinned over the recent years.  Truly a meal into itself, but I shall save some to have with my dinnermaybe :o)

Initial taste is strong like a grainy/liquor flavor with some malt coming in quickly.  Body is sweet and medium full.  Thins quickly towards the finish, which is roasty and medium dry.  I keep thinking about straw and that dry liquory taste, but that is from the high alcohol content no doubt.  A good beer, and drinkable at all temperatures, to my surprise.  Could use some more hop character, as it is very astringent and needs the alcohol masked better.

Good sized head complete with a beige head leaving a slight bit of lacing on my glass.. a nice looking dark. The flavor however was a bit funky to say the least. At first the dark fruits and malt blended into a somewhat nutty taste..very strange. It then matured into the beer i was expecting which was a heavy dose of malt supported by a cast of plum, and grapefruit flavors..very nice indeed. It is a dopplebock, but geez the malt was a bit in excess here..i didnt care to much for the ending where the fruityness subsided.

The aroma is inviting, malty, and sweet with a hint of molasses.  The color is dark, gorgeous and welcoming, teasing you with just the most obscure view of what""""s on the other side of the glass.  There was little head to speak of, and it disappeared rather quickly.  The brew was very active and bubbled like champagne through to the last swallow.  I expected a thicker, more maliable palate, but was very disappointed.  It was thin and seemed to want to leave the mouth before it""""s time.  The flavor was rich and sharp, with initial chocolaty roasted malts coming through but quickly being overtaken by hoppiness and alcohol.  The aftertaste was alcoholic and a little medicinal for my taste.  Overall, a good beer, but somewhat disappointing compared to many of it""""s doppelbock cousins.","Rowlett, Texas, USA","RDeschain"

Fine beads of bubbles contribute to a small, lingering head, which leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass.  The aroma is full of sweet, woody malt.  Mouthfeel is sticky with a slight tinge of carbonation.  The flavor is dominated by sweet/slightly sour malt, which could be a bit cloying, but is balanced well by a touch of hops in the finish.

Heavily dependent on the roasted chocolate malt flavor, could be a bit more complex as the finish thins out a bit, but the abv is covered well and this serves as a perfect winter warmer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
1239,"2001-05-14",3.9,"Rich and malty with a nice maple taste. A little thick and sticky. Settle quite nicely. Warms as it goes down.","Lancaster, California, USA","weeicemon"

A bit too sweet for my tastes.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","scrawfis"

1239,"2001-04-23",4.1,"This beer is a bit outclassed by its peers.  Generally I have found crisper tastes in other dopplebocks.  The flavor is very nice, with almost a toffee edge, but it rounds off quickly.","Ohio, USA","cartel99"
1239,"2001-04-09",3.3,"UPDATED: FEB 6, 2004 Sweet, malty but surprisingly faint aroma, some caramel and licorice.  Dark red-brown in color, with a lasting, fine, creamy head and very nice lacing.  Flavor is just a bit of sweet, caramel maltiness with a slightly bready, toasty, bittersweet finish.  Medium-full body, slightly watery palate.  Not nearly as flavorful as I recall from my last sampling years ago.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
1239,"2001-04-08",5.0,"This is my personal favorite! The Perfect amount of carbonation. I converted my old fridge into a keg fridge and its the only beer i will put in there.","Seminole, Florida, USA","keiko99"

1239,"2001-02-18",4.7,"Quite possibly the best widely available, reasonably priced beer available in the States.  If you want a great beer and dont want to pay $5 per bottle, buy a sixer of this terrific dopple for $7!  Has the great caramel/toffee taste we all know and love, as well as a great balancing, tea-like hop finish.  This beer is almost always in my fridge.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
1239,"2001-02-07",3.9,"Not a terribly complex doppelbock, but very smooth.  Alcohol in the aroma, but not obvious in the flavor or finish.  This is a very good doppelbock overall.  It may be more suited for a beginning doppelbock drinker, but can certainly be enjoyed by a doppelbock veteran.","Acworth, Georgia, USA","billb"
1239,"2000-12-15",4.5,"While I agree that this doesnt have the chewiness and complexity of other dopplebocks I still consider it a world classic.  Its smooth and has a great clean malty flavor and aroma.  It packs a punch, and gives me an ear to ear shit eatin grin every time.  When I think of great beer, Optimator never fails to come to my mind.  If youre looking for the raisin/prune thick chewy dopplebock this may not be your ticket.  But if youre looking for a fuller, richer Marzen or Oktoberfest then this is your beer!","Sandy, Utah, USA","opiate"
1239,"2000-11-29",3.9,"A german classic - dark ruby color short spotted head, rich warming taste - another yardstick for doppels - perhaps not the best of its class - but its certainly up there! For that matter - I havent found the best yet either!  Cheers!","Palm Beach Gardens, FL, Florida, USA","blatz"
1239,"2000-11-18",2.9,"Im not huge on this beer.  Its all right, but it lacks the stylishness that makes doppelbocks like Celebrator or Andechs so amazing.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1239,"2000-11-06",4.0,"A well crafted German Dopplebock. Maybe not the best out there, but top 5 material. Dark ruby red color; rich malty nose; very chewey mouthfeel with an intense blast of fruity, sweet malt flavor; maintains its flavor intensity right to the finish. In general, not as hefty as Salvator or some other Dopples.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

1239,"2000-09-24",4.5,"Thank God for ratebeer - the reviews convinced me to try this, and it did NOT dissapoint.  Dark ruby red/bronze color, beautifully balanced yet strong malty aroma and flavor, and one of the best aftertastes Ive experienced.  I need to try more doppelbocks now...love at first sight!","Portland, Maine, USA","Sammys"
1239,"2000-08-31",4.0,"Ok, this is one great beer.  A very malty sweet flavor.  This was definitely a note worthy beer.","Old Town, Maine, USA","beerman991979"
1239,"2000-08-29",4.5,"Fabulous beer.  I had to try one based on its favorable reviews and this beer did not disappoint.  Great malt character, very smooth, and deceptively strong.  Take their Oktoberfest and kick it
up two notches and you will have Optimator.  The malt profile is very clean and balanced-- for this reason I prefer Optimtor to Paulaner Salvator.","Manhattan, Kansas, USA","marc77"

nicely full-bodied sweet malt flavor.
Strong but not overwhelming.  Very good - one
of the top doppelbocks (but see Celebrator).
It's main appeal is a strongly clean and light, perhaps highly attenuated palate.  Has real appeal as a malt-monster.  Darkish amber, small head.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
