2693,"2017-04-27",4.2,"6 oz pour at Ale Arsenal in San Carlos, CA. Pours a oily black-brown with absolutely no head, not even a bubble. Aroma is roasted grains, cocoa, ground coffee, some raisin and light vanilla. Taste is dark chocolate with a mix of dry cocoa and dried cherries or raisins, slight bourbon heat with vanilla and oak mixed in.

2693,"2017-04-23",3.7,"Draught at Ale Arsenal. Deep brown with no head. Aroma and flavor are moderate chocolate, deep fruit and slight booze. A little restrained in all of the flavor aspects.","Redwood City, California, USA","Zymurgeist2"
2693,"2017-04-17",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Raisiny and chocolatey angles are met by mild roast and oxidation, as alcohol heat controls the aftertaste.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the copper-hued darkness.
-Oxidation at this early stage in a strong ales development is worrying.
-The mouthfeel is rather luxurious.
-Bourbon barrel isnt overdone.
