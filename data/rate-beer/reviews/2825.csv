Zesty citrus, herbal lengths and bread crumbs whirl about in this fluffy, unfiltered Pilsener.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A foam cumulus leaves patches all around the pint glass, decorating the cloudy straw blond.
-Corn-like angles are imagined here and there.
-Herbal hop bitterness balances out the finish.
-Mouthfeel is pleasantly dry and bubbles are plump.
-Trou du Diables lagers are very much in the same mold.
-Drinkability is really high, as expected.
-I am impressed by the condition of this beer having gone through Quebecs import system (private import, but still through the SAQ monopoly) with nary a scratch. Its best by date, in November, may point to the brewers high confidence in his product as well....

Taste is much better than the smell of the beer, as it is defined by malt, wheat, straw, fresh cut grass and lemon peel, which adds a recognizable floral hop note. The beer has a decent complexity, and still remains being easy drinkable. Especially the noble hops stand out in this beer, as they go very well with the Pilsener character, while adding a well-focused, refreshing bitterness and subtle dry mouthfeel. Carbonation is very lively and supports the ligh session-character.","GERMANY","aleigator"

The aroma offers up a dash of sugary candy malts and the it quickly gets to business with hoppy notes like soft lime citrus, spicy hops and a bit of flowery herb like floral hops. The taste is similar where it starts with a flash of neutral malt sweetness and a moment later modest lime citrus turns into a good dose of grapefruit bitter and flavor hops. To midway it picks up herbal and flowery hops that are on the bitter side and blended pretty well with the nearly tart grapefruit hop bitterness. This is light and refreshing and firm with hoppy bitter goodness from front to back. Due to the load of hops in this it doesnt seem all that Pils like but the great taste is hard to ignore so I wont. Nice beer.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Unfiltered, with smooth remnants of a yeast profile making for a mild and easy drinking experience despite the assertive late wet hop bitterness.

Pours pale golden with a hint of haziness and sports a white head with big bubbles and good retention. The nose consists primarily of notes from orthodox German noble hops: floral, earthy, woody, spicy, and subtly citric; nice bouquet, but could be more intense. The flavor of the malt is white-bready up front. On the mid-palate, it gets steadily overwritten by the noble hops with all of the notes from the nose. The bitterness is sharply snappy and stays in the very clean finish along the bready barley malt; the malt which had been there all along, only being upstaged by the hops. The carbonation is above average for a pilsener, which is a welcome twist. Pretty damn decent pilsener.","Berlin, GERMANY","Schnabelhund"
