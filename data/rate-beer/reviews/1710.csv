1710,"2017-02-19",3.5,"440ml can. Pours pale, clear and with a good head. Lemon, banana, pepper, white chocolate, little creaminess, some sweet dough. Surprising level of alcohol heat given the not gigantic strength. Not bad.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","explosivedog"
1710,"2016-11-06",3.5,"Spicy citrus aroma in a hazy yellow pour. Similar flavor profile, with lemon and cloves predominating. Crisp clean finish only adds to the moreishness.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","beer-yum"
1710,"2016-10-13",4.0,"I loved this beer. Aroma was as strong as an IPA, but quite lemony. The taste was refreshing and a lovely reinforcement of the citrus, this time with lemongrass dominating.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","tombutlin"
1710,"2016-08-05",3.8,"Can - pours hazy yellow with a pillowy white head. Aroma is cloves, bubblegum, citrus and lots of spice. Lots of spice and bubblegum, bit sweet up front then a dryer finish. Nice beer.","AUSTRALIA","Dervock"
1710,"2016-05-22",3.5,"Tap. Hazy, golden, frothy, white foam, light sweetness, medium bitterness, medium body, oily feel, fizzy, & bitter finish.","Jakarta, INDONESIA","Ngejo"
1710,"2016-04-12",3.9,"A great looking beer, hazy gold with a lasting white foamy with good lacing. Taste of Belgian yeast, banana, clove and spice. Medium body with a spicy hop finish.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","Luvystypotables"
1710,"2016-03-11",3.7,"Pours a clear golden with abundant white head. Good thing this isnt labelled as a hefeweizen, its as clear as a bell. Nose is fragrant banana, clove, passion fruit, pineapple. A mix of hoppy and hefe. Flavor is lots of clove, a little banana, more tropical fruit, and am assertive bitterness on the back palate that you wouldnt normally find in a hefe. Medium body, fizzy. Not bad. I feel like the hefe portion of a hefeweizen would have helped give a little more body and complexity here. But pretty delicious fusion of styles otherwise.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Niksko"
1710,"2016-01-25",3.9,"Love this beer, should be more of these styles around. Nose is wheat-malt esters, bit of candied banana with a bit of piney allure, palate is a generous wheat malt drink with nice mid-palate hop flavour and bitter finish. Great drink, sip or skol!","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","lliams"
1710,"2016-01-08",3.4,"Very good wheat beer, did not expect that to come from a can, smooth citrus muted by bitterness.

Would drink again, not too much aroma, but really nice.","","GarrettGotu"
1710,"2015-09-10",4.1,"Can from Archive Beer Boutique 100915. Yet another great can and an equally great beer. Clear amber colour with a fluffy pillow of white foam. Banana and grapefruit aromas. We need more of these beers.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"
1710,"2015-07-02",3.6,"Obviously a story attached to this one and it sounds like a belter. The beer itself is hazy golden with a rocky white head and has trails of carbonation slowly wafting to the top of the body. The aroma is dry, which is usually anomalous to the style of German weiss in my experience. No banana, not much spicy clove, not a suggestion of either bubblegum or a Singaporean Policeman ready to arrest thoughtless discard of said bubblegum. It is a dry spice with maybe touches of meringue. The flavour has that gentle spiciness (I say gentle, I had a penang curry for dinner) as well as a sweetish maltiness before it hits the tongue, evaporates and leaves a tangy orange zest character behind. It tastes true to style and I rather like this. 
Now to hit wikipedia and find out who this bloke was.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
1710,"2015-06-18",3.5,"Pours gold with a large head.
Nose shows doughy wheat, spicy and herbal hops and some peppery notes.
Similar flavours; doughy wheat, banana and herbal hops.
Carbonation seems a bit aggressive.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Davros"
1710,"2015-06-11",3.7,"Can, 9C. Barely hazy pale gold with a large white head that lasts well. Wheaty and spicy aroma with some vanilla, zest and a little banana, gentle floral and passionfruit notes . Light bodied, high carbonation. Not much sweetness. Tangy wheat, cloves, vanilla, oranges, tropical. Dry and quite bitter at the end, leaving a mouthful of spices. Good stuff.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
1710,"2015-05-19",3.6,"Pours hazy yellow with thin white head. Strong esthery aromas; big banana, bubblegum, raspberry, and the hops come through in the nose as well. Taste is similar, sweet at first with plenty of yeasty banana, then the hops come through on the finish and provide a moderately bitter aftertaste. This is possibly NZs first Hopfenweisse, and it has set the bar quite high.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","Vannerator"
