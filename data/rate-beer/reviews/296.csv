In the landscape of Imperial IPAs, there are many that can be called intriguing, but only a select few can truly be described as beautiful. Maine Beer Dinner is one of those few. Yellow-orange pour with lots of haze, head, and lacing. Tropical and piney nose - bright with zest and resin. Grapefruit, pineapple, orange, melon, and tangerine flavors. Some pine, too. Lots of juicy fruit flavors yet very little bitterness. Bone dry finish. This is like an East coast Pliny the Elder. Its perfect.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

296,"2016-01-24",3.7,"Bottled July 2015, drunk early August 15 and again mid-January 16.Great appearance, with a moderate haze to the lime-tinted bronze body. Large white head shows strong retention.It was interesting to try the beer under a month old and then six months old. It may seem ridiculous to even bother noting its character at six months of age, but Id actually say that with the massive, massive amount of hops, acid/bitterness and yeast character in this thing, it didnt hurt to keep it (very cold fridged) for a while. Young the stuff is just a plethora of every possible hop characteristics; pineapple, wintergreen, dank marajuana, earthiness, pine, citrus. There is some definite yeast stink to it but the alcohol is fairly well-concealed (though a touch of heat, for sure). In the flavor, its quite bitter, though perhaps not anything absurd for a DIPA. Lots of grapefruit, some grassiness, pineapple and tangerine. The carapils and C40 do add some toasted character, but its not too much of an interference. Texture shows soft, well-attenuated maltiness and tight carbonation.In the end, Id opine its probably a bit better to give this thing a month or so to have the yeastiness and strong bitterness some time to fade. Certainly a well-made beer, though aggressive, as MBC hoppy beers are.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Head is initially average sized to large, frothy, white, mostly lasting.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.

Medium body, velvety/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

Not enjoyable...big time oniony nose, probably caused by shitty ol Simcoe (Mosaic can smell like that sometimes too, though, but thats probably whats yielding the melon note). A drain pour but I still love my Clarky Bear!","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Has a glowing orange color, with a soon collapsing, bubbly head.

Got an intense, fruity nose, with lots of juicy oranges, among herbs and glazed malts. The orange yields a glue like aspect, as well as prickly kiwi notes, with a resinous impact, blending well into the sweeter smells.

Taste is more herbaceous than the nose revealed, with a gentle influence of fresh cut grass, balanced by pine and wooden, slightly biscuity malts. On top of that settles the orange fruitiness, with lots of white peel being noteable, while an enjoyable hop bitterness becomes visible, getting easily balanced by the earthy malts and a lower, well fitting carbonation, which provides a very smooth mouthfeel. The present malt backbone gets joined by a slick, semi dry kiwi punch, among chunks of grapefruit during the finish, pulling the beer into a hoppier direction. Amazingly balanced, easy drinkable double IPA, with an ever evolving, gentle hop character.","GERMANY","aleigator"

296,"2014-08-07",4.2,"The beer pours a gorgeous, golden, orange, settling into the glass with a creamy, off-white head of minuscule bubbles that lasts at a fingers width above the beer. The head leaves sticky fat fluff of lacing when it rescinds. In body, the beer is a nearly opaque murk of tiny particulates and haze. On the nose is where this beer is king. From the moment you pop the bottle you know you are in for a tropical fruit bomb. Even from a foot away, my glass is oozing fruit salad scent across the nose, but when I get my nostrils nicely in the glasss bulb, Im met with decadent and complex hop aromas. Pine resin blends with pineapple, mango, soft melon, and fruity caramel. Alcohol does prickle at the edges of the nose, but only if you search for it, and as a whole the nose just comes off smelling like a hugely aromatic fruit salad with accents of pine. This has got one damn fine nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet up front, but with definite bitter balance that builds into the middle and finish of the beer wonderfully. Booze makes its presence known towards the finish of the sip, punching through some of the decadent hop notes while acidity is faintly present on the fringes of the tongue. In flavor the beer begins as pineapple juice, moving more towards pine with flashes of medicinal hops, bright grass, lemon citrus, and grapefruit juice. Slight alcohol and caramel hops enter in the middle of the sip, but the finish of the beer is straight ruby red grapefruit juice with just a hint of booze. The aftertaste is of piney/grapefruity hops. In the mouth, the beer feels medium to full bodied, with a middling carb that provides a healthy scrub to the tongue. Mouthfeel is crisp and effervescent, if a touch heavy towards the finish of the sip. Overall, this is a hell of a Double IPA. Ive already heard it compared to the Headys and Plinys of the world (gasp) but I think that was a forgone conclusion. MBC makes some damn fine hoppy beer and this is no exception. This beer strikes towards the top of the DIPA list for sure, and is a true work of art in terms of juicy, tropical fruit hops. I do have some quibbles with it, however, as I do with any beers. For starters, I think the booze could be a little better integrated, as it does add a bit too much heat towards the back of the sip. I also feel that the nose far outweighs the taste in terms of overall decadence and hop character, which can be argued as an attribute of DIPAs, but since we are talking God-Tier DIPAs I must say that others of this plateau have met that balance more so than Dinner. The nose is where Dinner is a winner, for sure, and she is a damn fine winner. Drink the beer fresh. Enjoy it. Wait in line for three hours if you want to. Its a nice beer.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

Taste is off the charts oily hops & a mess of fruit rinds; mild hemp oil dank notes with wave after wave of pungent mango juice, guava, grapefruit, tangerine... The tropical assault continues relentlessly. Hidden green onion freshness with the finish more focused on zesty, floral hops, tangerine peel, & hop oils. You almost dont notice due to the juiciness of the brew, but the aftertaste leaves a pleasantly strong bitterness on the palate. Finishes quite dry, as do most of MBCs hoppy brews, leaving a mild resinous feeling behind. Maine has already impressed me previously; Dinner is incredible. They NEED to produce this beer more often & in larger quantity.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

296,"2014-06-09",3.8,"Pours golden orange with medium white head and some lacing. Aroma: tropical fruits all around (mangos, peaches, grapefruits, lemon), flowers, and hops. Fruity bitterness. Alcohol is well hidden, a very nice DIPA","New Brunswick, CANADA","jdobbs"
296,"2014-06-08",4.0,"500 mL bottle supplied by WillRunForBeer. Many thanks! To long-stemmed tulip, it pours a hazy bright orange with which a whitish-ringed head 1 finger in length stood. Aromas of lemon peels, Oude Bruin dregs, marsh rosemary, California fresh white sage, lavender, sweet basil, West coast hops, green hay, and corn. Tastes the same with the addition of blueberry leaves, sweat, leeks, and bay leaves. Smells paints a picture that was going to be a masterpiece, but the flavors didnt meld fully together. Still a wonderful, juicy DIPA, but just not in the whale-level of awesomeness I was expecting.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"

296,"2014-05-29",4.0,"Slightly hazy orangish-gold color; dense, frothy white head. Orange, grapefruit, mango, and floral notes. The sliver of initial sweetness quickly becomes dried citrus peel bitter. Lively, not quite medium bodied, with a very long resin finish.","California, USA","Ataraxia"
296,"2014-05-27",4.3,"Bottle from trade, thanks Nick! Pours pale yellow gold with a big white head that clings. Aroma of tropical fruit fills the room when this is poured - mango, tangerine, some pine as well. Soft mouthfeel, just a touch of caramel in a pale malt backbone that supports waves of juicy hop. Flavors are again tropical, mango, tangerine. Pine resin bitterness in the finish.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"

Flavor will not disappoint. Im not going to be long winded here, if you can get this fresh, do so. This is like fresh squeezed hop juice and fruit. Top tier for the style. Juicy, grassy and just a hint of resin. Tons of bright citrus! Bitterness does not linger at all, here and gone. Just plain juicy.
