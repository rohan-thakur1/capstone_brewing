Lingering grassy, herbal tone on the finish. Smoothly but generously effervescent on the palate lending a smooth, creamy feel, body is medium.

3693,"2012-11-01",3.9,"22oz Bottle. The pour was a cloudy reddish amber with an average (1-2 finger) light cream colored frothy head that had great retention, eventually reducing to a thick puddled film with an extra large collar thus producing excellent sheets of lacing.

The aroma was of a sweet caramel malt, herbal hops and a light earthy yeast with notes of citrus (grapefruit), toffee and a light tropical fruity ester (pineapple and mango).

The taste was lightly sweet and rather malty with a nice toffee sweetness early on, and then became mildly hoppy with a bold grapefruit presence and had a nice mild tropical fruitiness towards the end. The flavor hung around for a good long while after the swallow which allowed the hoppy fruity taste to settle in on the taste buds.

Mouthfeel was just past the middle of light to medium in body and was rather dry in texture with a almost ticklish carbonation.

3693,"2012-09-06",4.5,"22oz bottle into a pint glass.

Pours a hazy orange-red with a huge billowy head. Absolutely amazing head retention and lacing. Really some of the best I have ever seen.

Aroma has lots of piney hops perfectly balance by caramel malt. A little toffee as well along with a slight bit of citrus.

The flavor has a shot of piny/citrus hops up front quickly followed by a breeze of coffee before toffee and caramel take hold. Wonderful toast and caramel perfectly balanced by both hop flavor and bitterness. Bitterness is on the high side but doesnt overpower a wonderful toasty finish.

Overall, this really is a wonderful beer. The balance is really as close to perfect as I think you can get. This is my first beer from Three Floyds after finally tracking some down in KY.

3693,"2012-04-02",3.9,"Served on tap in a pint glass.

The trademark Three Floyds signature creamy cap sits on top of the fuzzy amber beer.  Tightly wound sheets of lace leave a beer level history down the side of the glass.

The aroma is not outrageously hoppy per se, but it does have a much hoppier nose than the Irish Red style it supposedly is.  Toasted bread and caramel bring in some spice, juicy grapefruit, and a bit of tropical fruit.

The flavors really pack a punch, especially considering the comparatively low ABV.  Toaste grain and bread really control the flavor, with some caramel and toffee notes adding a touch of sweetness.  Next the hops really begin to take off.  There is a nice grapefruit citrus kick with a strong pineapple and general tropical fruit presence.  The hops are bitter, but they never entirely take over, leaving a strongly flavored, hop-centric but balanced Irish Red in the end.

Compared to the style, the body feels on the fuller, creamier side.  The carbonation is smooth and gently scrubs the remaining hop oils off the tongue after each sip.  

This does not get the name recognition as some of the other Three Floyds beers do, but it is definitely a solid Irish Ale.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

4.5 A: Clear medium orange color. Two and a half fingers of off-white, dense creamy head. Retention is better than average and plenty of lacing is left.

4.5 S: This is hopped to hell and back. Mango and pineapple dominate the nose. Underneath there is a slight amount of toffee, oat, and caramel. Super clean. Not the most complex, but thats because the hops cover up mostly everything. Smells wonderful nonetheless.

3.5 T: Tasty, but its lacking the typical red ale flavors for the most part. The hops again dominate, leaving little room for caramel and toffee to shine. Mild bitterness. Pineapple and mango hop flavor, but not nearly as intense as the nose. Oats are detectable, at least more so than the caramel and toffee. Surprisingly not very toasty.

3.5 M: Lighter medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Reasonably creamy for how light the body is.

3.5 D: This is more like Alpha King than an actual Irish Red Ale. Oh well, its tasty, but I was expecting an Irish ale so Im a bit disappointed.

Definitely worth a try if its in your vicinity/price range/whatever.

3693,"2012-03-17",4.1,"22oz bottle with no freshness date. Come on FFF! I happen to know that this is a fresh bottle, but still. That being said, I couldnt think of a better beer to kick off my B-day (which also happens to be St. Patricks Day). Cheers!

Pours an amber-red color with one finger of off-white head. The head has settled quite a bit after 7 minutes or so, but theres some pretty good lacing and retention. Pretty good clarity, although there is a slight haze to it.

Nice citrus notes in the aroma following the pour. Im definitely getting orange and grapefruit along with a good amount of toasted malt and grains. Very impressive.

The malts actually hit the palate first, but it isnt long before that citrus from the aroma starts provide some bite and flavor. Theres some bitterness, but it doesnt linger. The malts surface again near the back end making for a rather traditional Irish Red finish with the hops lingering just a bit.

Medium bodied mouthfeel with a carbonation that sits between medium and high.

Overall, this is the best Irish Red that Ive ever had by far and away.

The malt profile proves pleasant and toasty, but there is a touch of pineapple and lemon in the nose that seems off somehow.

Thanks for flying this one from Chicago to Hoboken for me Sammy!  These guys have a slightly different interpretation of some styles.  They seem to make a lot of styles taste like IPAs.  Not that Im complaining, Im a fan, but that typical 3Floyds hop feel in this one doesnt really make it taste much like an Irish Red.

T- Big juicy citrus flavors upfront with some exotic fruit in there as well. The backbone contains a good dose of sweet caramel malt and a sugary sweetness that seems to be a little bit off. The malt comes through a little bit more for the finish but the flavor profile seems to be more about the hops.

P- Medium carbonation and smooth oily medium weight body.

O- Quite interesting to have this very hoppy Irish Red Ale. As much as this brew is pretty much blasphemy to a traditional representation of the style- drinkable, irish red filled with smooth and creamy caramel malt; I still really enjoyed this beer although I am pretty hesitant to call it an Irish Red. Another well done, but strange brew from FFF.

3693,"2010-04-14",3.8,"Pours from the 22oz bottle a deep amber red color, very clear and a bubbly off-white head. Aroma has a strong Amarillo hops really hits your nose first, and smells like you just opened a fresh bag of hop leaf. Mild caramel/toffee sweetness but mostly hops in the nose. Flavor a strong Amarillo hops orange citrus flavor, mild caramel/toffee malt presence in the middle, a solid leafy hops ending. Body was modest with a very smooth texture, low carbonation and nice lacing. Overall a very enjoyable brwe with a tone of hops nose and flavor. Malt comes through on a light/mild note making it not a typical Irish ale with the extreme high hips presence.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"
3693,"2010-03-29",3.9,"Bomber shared with my brother-in-law. I absolutely love Three Floyds and was excited to see this on the shelf at my local liquor store. It pours a deep mahogany color with a one finger with tan head that disappears quickly. The aroma really took me by surprise... it was loaded with fresh hops, pine, citrus, and caramel malt! This is easily the most complex and pleasant red ale that I have had. The taste is along the same lines as the aroma with fresh hops, pine, and hints of citrus. Finishes very smooth and leaves you wanting more. Easily the best red ale I have had... leave it to Three Floyds to accomplish that feat!","Streator, Illinois, USA","General66"

Original Rating (3/19/10): 22oz from Three Cellars.  This beer is good, and definately worth the hunt (took me a while to find it).

3693,"2010-03-17",4.2,"22 oz. bottle from the Party Source.  Great to see Three Floyds now in Kentucky.  Pours a clear, deep rubycolor with a centimeter-thick beige head.

Flavor of piney hops, resin, grapefruit and orange citrus, toast, herbal notes, and caramel malts.  Light-medium bodied, with average carbonation and a dry, bitter finish.  Crisp, refreshing, and so well-balanced.  Perfect amount of hops and bitterness.  Im actually surprised to see this at under 6% ABV, so its definitely sessionable.

There is also some great carmel flavour in here.  The more I sip the more I realize the sweet flavor of tropical fruits staying with me long after Ive drank it.

The taste is actually mild for what I was expecting from the smell.  The caramel malts come through with a toasted toffee character.  The hops are there, but seem to fade quickly with just a hint of the grapefruit flavor.  There is a doughy yeast characteristic as well.  The palate is almost creamy, and very lasting with average carbonation.  The caramel flavor lasts for a while on the aftertaste.  Overall, this is a very easy beer to drink.

I founf this beer to be very enjoyable.  It has a stronger hop character than I would have expected from an Irish Ale, but I think that really adds to it.  I agree with Bigmmartin with it not being a very complex beer, but I think it is one of the better Irish Ales I have ever had.

Pours a nice orange reddish amber with off white head.  Under certain light it looks very deep red.  The aroma is roasty and malty with notes of fruit and a maybe a bready yeast aroma.  The flavor matches the aroma and is malty, nutty, lightly bitter, and a little milky.  The mouthfeel reminds of a less sticky milk stout, very smooth and creamy.

Hopped, but still malt forward, surprising for a FFF brew, but very logical. Finishes smooth, flavors remaining on the palate, but still light enough to be a session brew.

Initial sweet toffee malts and more of the berry candies. Slowly moves to a mild citrus bitterness mixed with a earthy maple syrup before finishing malty sweet, slightly tart, a little nutty, and juicy pineapple. Dry in finish with a light citrusy sweet linger. Full bodied, smooth, and syrupy. Overall, a really nice Irish Red, but maybe a little too sweet to put this over the top.

Lower carbonation and light to medium bodied. It was a decent beer and loved the smell, but I can’t say I’d search this out.

3693,"2008-05-27",3.6,"Glassy crimson pour produces a thin bubbled beige head, quickly retreating and gathering itself in a shallow patch at the surface center.  Pineapple aroma leaps out in front, declaratively.  Strawberry jam, caramel, citrus aroma; warm, rotund toasted malts offer a swelling, rich sweetness that provides a strident complement to these particular notes of vibrant hops.  Rich balanced flavor, brisk and autumnal; hops integrated, not bandied about.  Red tea, toasted malt toffee, citrus rinds, some distant sweet-tartness of blackberry.  There isnt, interestingly, very much to gather from it, while concurrently the flavor seems full, compressed and polished.  Its dug out a path to satiating balance with hardly a single deviance in the interest of complexity.  A quick, sweet flutter of florals mid palate.  Medium body is somewhat slick and softly carbonated; finishes with a length of earthy, mulchy malt and gentle bitterness.

Some cereal grains enhance the authenticity of the style as well.  Flavors are well balanced, not too hoppy or too sweet.  Grapefruit really asserts itself as the dominant bittering component, while toffee and toasted bread show the caramel who is boss.  Medium bodied and smooth, there is a slightly lactic creaminess to the mouthfeel that really works well in this brew.

Mmmm this might be my favorite Three Floyds yet.  Floyds has really great hop combinations but this is pretty fantastic the way the malts are played off of them.  Really rich slightly toasted malts.  Flavors of maple and slightly burnt brown sugar.  It goes about as far sugary as it can without being sticky.  Really soft easy drinking yet very full mouthful too.  Some woodiness in the finish.

[Rerate fresh 09 bottle 3.12.09]  Pours a magnificent rich glowing almost clear red with a frothy white head.  Aroma of fresh dirty earthy green oily hops, not so much the pineapple malty brown sugar aroma as before which is a shame as I really loved that.  The flavor although indicates a bit of that.  Not quite as rich and malty as I remember.  Earthy green oily hops over a sugary malt base without so much toffee/caramel character as should be.

3693,"2008-02-25",4.2,"Poured into the usual tulip, this beer is red, duh. It leaves some nice sticky lacing. I could tell you that this beer is from Three Floyds with one whiff. Pineappley, citrusy hops abound. Some toasty, bready, sweet malt sticks out too. 

The taste is somewhat mild for Three Floyds. The hops arent as plentiful as the smell would lead me to believe. They are the driving force behind this beer, however. The sweet malt doesnt get totally left behind. This is a very refreshing beer. 

The mouthfeel is light, yet somewhat syrupy, from the hops most likely. The carbonation is mid-level. The drinkability is fantastic, due to the low ABV and clean finish. Other than the hoppiness, which seems to increase as the beer warms, this might be a good introduction to craft beer for the nonbeliever.

How: Mtl-crew beer-and-spagatt Tasting.  Bottle from acquired through dmac621.  Thanks a lot Dave.
The look: Cloudy amber body with a very small beige head.
In long: The crisp caramel is balanced-off by crisp citrusy hops with a little pine-tree twist.  Never too sweet, never bitter, always drinkable.  The caramel maltiness knows where to stop so that the hops can dry it out just enough.  Not surprisingly this is currently ratebeer #1 Irish Ale, a very simple and more often than not very boring style.  But this is a top-notch session beer, a perfect example of quality despite simplicity.

Alcohol is marvelously disguised. The flavor is mildly hoppy, with low to mild bitterness and very low acidity. Sweetness is medium, toffee introduces itself after caramel flavors subside. This is incredibly drinkable, albeit one dimensional due to such soft integration of like-minded flavors. The finish is lightly bitter, soft and fruity/flowery. The palate is very smooth, mildly but adequately carbonated, medium bodied and excellently organized in a soothing mouthfeel.

Brian Boru poured a slightly hazed dark crimson. The beer glows a caramel red/brown when held to the light. minimal head formed until I poured a little more aggressively. 1 finger of slightly off white head formed but faded rather quickly. Left sheet lacing after the drop.

Smell is big on the caramel backbone. What really comes up front though is a solid dose of pine sap and pineapple hops. Pine sap and ripe grapefruit to be exact. I drank this last year when it came out but I dont remember such a pronounced juicy pineapple aroma. Makes my mouth water.

Ripe pinapple is in the flavor as well. Caramel is still the malt backbone but theres a juicy, fresh, ripe pineapple character thats really refreshing. Pine needles are present mid-palate.The pineapple doesnt hit till the finish but lingers on and melds with minor hints of pine needles. Pine needles are present mid-palate before the pineapple and appear again.

Body is on the light side of medium. My only complaint is its a little too light. Nice hop bitterness gets the tongue a little thick. As this beer warms the body gets a hoppy oily feel on the tongue. Finishes dry.

Very refreshing and enjoyable beer. The lighter body actually helps the drinkability. One bomber isnt enough.

Three Floyds does some amazing things with hops. The get big juicy fruit flavor from hops that I havent expierenced from other breweries. Another winner from them. This would be a good one to be able to buy by the 6-pack.

Rounded, clean, and quite hoppy on the nose. No real surprise from 3F. Softly orange with a wafty pine scent intermingling well with just a touch of floral resins and pollen.

Taste is quick, clean, and rounded with a centered toasted bread dough tone and a slightly sticky toffee surrounded by a nice firm display of dully citric oily hoppyness. Kinda orangey, semi oily to nearly full, slippery in bitterness with a rounded off leafy pineyness. Soft, supple, and a good amount of flavor profile. A nice balance f both malt and hops makes this a nice treat.

Feel is clean, quite clean in fact, with a smooth oily slide to its nature thats very inviting and a very soft finish of lightly toasted malt sweetness and an orangey oilyness. Long lofty pine oil notes the finish late.

3693,"2006-09-30",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2007 Pours a hazy red brown with a dense light tan head, dwindling gradually.  The nose is big, rich and round.  Malty goodness ranging from lightly sweet to caramel and even a bit toasty without being cloying in the least balanced by a lovely tropical fruit sort of hoppiness.  Really pleasant mouthfeel as well, rich and full and creamy, though not particularly thick and heavy.  And the best part is the taste still!  The flavors are big and bold and well rounded, just as the aroma would indicate.  Sweet caramel malt and a big of toastiness blends in with the big, though not annoying, hops.  Theres almost a chocolatey element towards the end of this one.  The lingering aftertaste is a pineapple/guava sort of hops and dry toasty hops.  And to think, this was only 3 bucks, a bomber... I have to run back to the store and buy them out!

After much consideration, I had to knock the overall and flavor down one each.

Lots of thick toffee, nuts, light roast and some breadiness on the palate. Great medium body with medium carb and a lightly bitter finish.

3693,"2006-09-26",3.7,"bottle. Ah, I love Three Floyds attitude. I can see by the label that this is going to be an Irish red ale. Ive had enough of their offerings to know that this probably wont be the product of textbook brewing. I poured the bomber into a tall mug which reveals a quite cloudy amber body, and a firm, large white head. So, I take a whiff. Only because its 3 Floyds am I not surprised to find large amounts of hops. The prospect of an Irish ale overly hopped American style really amuses me, then I start to notice how awesome the aroma really is. Its got plenty of sweet lemon, pine, some pineapple, and dinner rolls in the aroma. Great boquet on this stuff. The flavor is the slightest let down, but really just because this beer smells so damn good. More biscuits come out it in the flavor and usher a hint of burned caramel along. The finish brings out a bit of bark and finishes citrusy sweet. Good citrus notes all around, really, very zesty. The hops are less noticed in the mouth than the nose, (but not subtle) giving focus to the group of malts. I find Irish-style Ales to be usually boring but easy to session drink any time. Brian Boru has an amazing drinkability and has its own quirky, unique take on the style. Its not normal.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Theres lotas of hops in the aroma, which is both strange but suprisingly welcome for a beer in this style. Fruity aromas take second place, and win the silver medal. Third place goes to caramel and burnt malts. But hops win the oscar. Sweet fruit and bold hops are the main flavour contenders, and suragy malt, burnt molasses have decided to tag along. Boru finishes sweet with good length of bitterness and ripe citrus. Id drink Irish Ales all day log if this was the archetype. Really very well done. Again Philip, you have my thanks. Great!","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"

3693,"2006-04-29",4.5,"Now here in an excellent domestic example of a classic Irish Red ale, but with an American twist. In typical Three Floyds fashion, this beer is bolder in aroma and flavor, than a classic example of an Irish Red.  In my opinion, this beer is an excellent tribute to a beer style that is near and dear to me. Brian Boru pours to a beautiful, bright, ruby red color, with a soapy, tan head, and a moderate carbonation. The nose on this beer is excellent, with lots of zesty, citrus hop aroma, paired with some estery fruity pineapple aroma, and some caramel malt sweetness. The palate is firm, with really good sweet and caramel malt, and toffee flavor, paired with a nice back drop of fruity pineapple estery flavor. Mouthfeel is slightly slick and ""buttery"", which is key element in an authentic Irish Red. Brain Boru finishes with more really good toffee, carmel, and fruit up front, then ends with a tangy burst of citrus hop bitterness. Delicious, drinkable, bursting with aroma and flavor, this is an outstanding example of Irish Red. The American hop aroma and bitteress is a nice addition, and while Im a sucker for a traditional example, Brain Boru really impressed me. Another great beer from FFF.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

Very pineapple and grapefruity hops, with a lot of high quality marijuana herbal bits in there (thank you hippie roommate!).  I dont think Ive ever gotten that much or that distinct weed in a beer.  There is also some caramel toffee--moreso caramel--and a bit of yeasty bread.

While Brian Boru spent his entire life fighting and eventually defeating the invading Vikings, I am quite content to let that maurading band from Three Floyds invade my San Diego homeland with their superb beer.  And Three Floyds has done it again, bottling yet another winner for us to revel in.  Compared to most amber/red ales, this offering is brimming with flavor, so much so that it clearly falls into that semi-official ""double red"" category for me in terms of flavor, yet apparently keeping the alcohol percentage down.  Lots of sweet, caramely malts provide a substantial base for this beer, with tea, tropical fruits and moderately bitter hops rounding out this very balanced beer.  The fruitiness is especially noticeable on the first few sips, but once the hops get a chance to saturate the palate, the fruitiness tends to get lost in the shuffle.  Sweet caramel and tea dominate the nose, but the beer doesnt smell especially hoppy.  No matter, this beer smells great.  Medium-full bodied, all corners of my mouth are fully awash in the beers smooth, velvety textures.  Deep ruddy amber color shows a bit of haze, and the light tan head pours to almost an inch before slowly settling to a filmy layer.  Modest lacing congregates in a few scattered patches about the glass.  Just an excellent beer in every way, but honestly, its totally unfair to compare this to other ""regular"" amber ales.

The aroma is dazzling; light hints of smoky malts, hints of caramelized brown sugar, a gentle nuttiness, but mostly a grand fruitiness and prefect balance of hops!

The flavor is malty up front, with some hops, fruit, berries, toffee, and nuts as it crosses the palate.  Medium palate, with good complexity and balance.

It has a darker than average cream color, stays around a while and produces a good lace. The citrus from the aroma shows up in the initial taste, but dissipates. There is no piney flavor to this one (to me, thats a good thing). It is colored like iced tea with a hint of amber. The taste is only average. Its not bad by any means, but there is more to the appearence and aroma than to the flavor. Only an initial hint of malt then slightly appealing bitterness.

Im pretty sure I smell cat piss, too, but that might just be the neighbors cat.  The body is thin, typical for an amber, I guess, but not what I expected for my seven bucks.  Its not just thin, its fleeting.  The punch of hops is short-lived as well, quickly giving way to a mild and disoriented earth/grape/sulfur sweetness.  Oh, I definitely smell cat piss in this beer.  Finishes with wet paper notes laced with sticky pineapple, mineral, and honeyed tea.  Lingering sweatsock.

Very subtle notes of lemon zest, and pungently earthy hops. Loosely woven carbonation. Opens with a gritty resin flash, but mostly slickly fruity with dull berry and tropical fruit notes. Smooth-edged nuttiness curbs the sharper roasted malt hull underlay. Glassy acidic tingle at the sides of the cheeks. Slight chalky airiness disperses much of the bodys denseness. Malts become quite husky as it warms, compounding the mushy body and undefined hop character. Finishes timidly hoppy, with an equilibrium of bready, nutty malt accents. Faint citrus hop burps. Overall, the hops severely lack that FFFs hallmark definition, and the body is too mushy. Pretty straightforward.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Pours a clear red-orange-amber, not particularly deep or hugely colorful, tending more towards ambery-copper.  Small off-white head is not long retained.  Aroma of dry hops, lightly floral, hints of grapefruit rind, a touch of biscuits and very brief glimpses of caramel.  Flavor begins with strong, drying hops.  Dry, very NOT flavorful and just astringent.  Some notes of biscuits, stale brown bread and lightly toasted grains.  Hints of grapefruit rind again, faint touches of honey and then water. . .soda water, that is (too much carbonation).  Medium-light body, lack of malt kills any chance of me getting excited about this.  Reminds me of Robert the Bruce (wheres the thick malting!).  I dont know what excuse there could be, this bottle was no doubt taken care of and it is only a few months old.  Maybe they just wanted to brew a grapefruit rind beer.

Very dry palate boasting more astringent hops than is recommendable. Very earthy, herbal (lichen, algae)..

Body is medium with moderate carbonation and light lingering bitterness. Finish produces a reduced hop profile, some earthy notes, light caramel and some pleasant sweet maltiness.

There arent this many hops in all of Ireland, unless of course they replaced the potatoes with hops and that is why they had that famine. Anyhow... The flavor is not as nice as the aroma caramel and light bread trying to come through but like a street urchin in the hands of a drunk Irish cop the malt is being bashed into oblivion by the heavy hand of sire OHoppolly.

3693,"2005-03-06",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2005 From the 3F tap:  This big-headed Irish starts off with a fragrant, well hopped aroma that doesnt completely cover the rich, fruity malts.  Its good and malty as an Irish should be, though heavier on the fruity flavors than  the caramel.  The hops, for 3F, arent overwheming but give a good, solid, pine and citric balance of bitterness.  Finishes on a snappy, bitter note.  Good stuff.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp? Floyds Brewing Company, Munster, IN<font size=-1>","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
3693,"2005-03-05",3.7,"Over the top, highly hopped Irish Red that has a very creamy mouthfeel...surprisingly bitter base with a sweet  malty balance that I really enjoyed.  Fresh from the tap at the brewery.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"
3693,"2005-03-05",3.3,"The more 3F I try the more similar all there beers seem.  Upon first popping the top to the bomber I had to look twice as the aroma was exactly like Gumbalhead.  Pours amber with a large thick tan head.  Typical 3F amarillo hop aroma.  Creamy mouthfeel.  Oily hop, caramel taste.  A quality beer that I am finding the brewers hop profile to be one dimensional after tasting 7 of their beers, IMO.","USA","kane"
3693,"2005-02-28",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2005 Re -rate, from bottle Brian is back for 05! The beer pours a reddish amber with a strong, floral, piney aroma. Strong, persistent, foamy head. Good, strong malty flavor with a bit of a carmelly aftertaste. The beer is not as bitter as you might expect from the aroma; the hops are mostly in the background, which is a nice change from FFFs normal stuff (not that Im complaining!)","Knoxville, Iowa, USA","Aureth"
3693,"2004-05-20",3.6,"I managed to have the last half pint at Bone Dry Bar (near FFF).  It was my first beer all year, ok, first ""half beer"".  Copper color with surprisingly fruity nose.  Malty first sip was caramelly and rich, I had almost forgotten what beer tasted like.  Finish was pure FFF heaven, plenty of lingering strong hops and an aftertaste that stayed hoppy for an hour.  This could lead me straight down the path to beergeek again in no time,  Thanks Nick... maybe Ill go back up to XXl in shirt size...","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
3693,"2004-04-20",3.5,"On tap, Bone Dry, Highland, IN. A lot more going on than you would think in a red. Medium-full body, white head, deep red coloring. Very floral up front and in the nose. Smooth in the middle diminshing dry at the end. Quite surprising and quite drinkable.","Highland, Indiana, USA","BATLMULLET"
3693,"2004-04-19",3.6,"Pours a reddish copper with an off-white head.  Very hoppy aroma with citrus tones.  Creamy mouthfeel. Sweet, caramel, toffee flavor. A very good brew.  This was from a growler shared by ""jables"" from his keg.  Many thanks.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
3693,"2004-03-26",4.2,"Aroma:  very sweet, kiwi fruit scents and pine with a small musty aroma

Appearance:  dark brown with a small head

Flavor:  kiwi fruits, pine, bubble gum, and slight musty flavor.  loaded with hops, very fruity--small hoppy/piney aftertaste.  a very drinkable beer

Palate:  dry, bitterness at the back of the tongue and roof of the mouth.  very flavorful.  carbonation just perfect.

Overall:  a very enjoyable beer","Adamstown, Maryland, USA","lilannie"
3693,"2004-03-22",4.0,"Sampled at the brewery.  Very sweet pineapple, kiwi, and sweet lime hopped aroma.  Good caramel malty flavors, overall very hopped, as usual from FFF.  Lingering hop finish of sweet pineapple and kiwi fruit.  A mellow beer, the hops arent as punch-you-in-the-face as other offerings.  Sweet bubblebum flavor.  Color is a deep brown with a tan head, slightly cloudy.  Very drinkable.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3693,"2004-03-17",4.1,"I was with three other people and they all agreed that this was a very good beer.It was thick with caramel amber body.It has a  good hopped aroma. There were citrus elements.With a smooth and creamy mouthfeel.","Hammond, Indiana, USA","rdog"
3693,"2004-03-16",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2004 On tap at the brewery (and at home, ha,ha,ha). Tons of hop character for a red ale. Piney and grapefruity aroma. Very good. Not a typical red ale, but a red pale ale.","New Lenox, Illinois, USA","HopsOrDie"
3693,"2004-03-16",3.3,"Draft at the brewery.  Murky brown with a thin head.  The nose was so pungent with hops that it reminded me of b.o.  I must have got all the grain astringency out of hey_kevin's sample.  Very hoppy for an amber with lots of celery greens.  This beer seemed one dimensional to me, and it wasn't the amber/red dimension.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
3693,"2004-03-16",3.1,"This reddish color beer had a smoky scent, which was evident in the taste as well. Very smooth.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","Pjones6738"
3693,"2004-03-14",4.7,"A treat when arriving to pick u the long awaited Dark Lord. Sweet pine fragrance, medium mouthfeel, crisp, less hoppy hen most of the other FFF brews, and beautiful auburn color. Nick can't find enoguh time to make more of these gemstoo bad. Great Irish red ale.","Valparaiso, Indiana, USA","novice"
3693,"2004-03-14",3.9,"Deep amber.  Huge intense amarillo hop aroma, mangoes and apricots.  As always with 3F, excellent hop flavor.  Not out of balance toward bitterness either.  Pleasant caramel malt character, without a trace of roasty astringency.  A good example of what I consider a non-style (irish ale) made interesting, bravo!","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
3693,"2004-03-14",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 18, 2005 Thick, caramel amber body with a full, fluffy white head.  Heavily hopped aroma with strong citrus elements and a underlying pine.  Also elements of caramel and toffee deep underneath.  Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, this doesnt feel as thick as it really is.  Sweet, sticky caramel and toffee malt lays at the base while strong hoppy grapefruit, orange and pine resin come through.  Another hoppy beer from Three Floyds, however, I think they always mix it up enough to make it interesting.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
3693,"2004-03-13",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2005 this is a smooooth and sweet ale. piney, orange, aftertaste. cremey palate. mostly hops, alas, but ya know. hadnt i shared my growler id give you a better review, however, it doesnt matter just know that its good. UPDATE 4/24/05 & 4/25/05: this is different than i remember. spicy, citrus/orange, floral hops. toffee, sweet malts. a little earthy. a little watery palate, but the mouthfeel is lively, and paradoxically slightly cremey... as if to balance it out in an old Irish way? Meh... anyway... it is smooth, and delicious. personally, a strong and wonderful session brew!","Petaluma, California, USA","steview"
3693,"2004-03-13",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 2, 2005 It was like a lopsided battle, like none ever seen before. On one side was a host of purported Irish paragons; Killians, Caffreys, & Finnegans. Standing alone, wind whipping through his hair, was Brian Boru. He was brashly-hoppily American, yet grounded as only a grounded malty Irishman could be. A legendary warrior with a holy hop scepter rumored to be blessed by the American Hop-Goddess herself.

Unexpectedly Boru sprung forth at his red Irish opponents. He was bitter, where they were mellow. He had a backbone strengthened by pure malt, where they were barely supported by misappropriated adjuncts. Borus scepter swept forth like a clean lemon acidity separating & curdling milk. They fled before Boru, the beast that was suckled at the teat of the hop nectar goddess.

Before friends Boru was sweet, but, quiver all ye foes for he shall unleash his bitter wrath upon all who displease him.

The women loved him, for when he passed lusty remembrances of rolling in the hay, with scents of pine needles, citrus, roses, and fruit waft through their minds.

In the end it is the unique dichotomy between the Irish & American that makes Boru so likeable, hoppily brash, yet smoothly malty, what is not to like.

So far only availible at the brewery, go out and get some if you have the chance.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
3693,"2004-03-13",3.7,"Growler from Munster: creamy red caramel poured from the jug, offering a large orange/brown waterfall of bubbles.  Characteristic Three Floyds piney aroma, but with more sugary sweetness.  Also reminded me of orange and grapefruit penny candy. . .creamy palate, with toasted pine cones, tangy grapefruit and orange zest.  Not as bitter as Dreadnaught or AK, but plenty of hop flavour.  I noticed the malt more as my glass warmed: wheaty bread and toasted rye.  After thoughts of gooey caramel and a bit of vanilla.  I wonderfully drinkable beer for me.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
3693,"2004-03-13",3.5,"Draft at brewery. Bit of a murky brown red body with an off-white head. Very VERY piney aroma. It may as well be a pine tree. Tastes has... piney hops with some orange citrus in it.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
3693,"2004-03-13",3.9,"My mouth still tasted like the Warrior hops in this bad boy,this morining. Murky,brown-first glass had specks. Green,sappy,hop aroma. I just couldn't smell any malt,very hoppy. Creamy,well carbonated,medium body. Some malt(toasty,bready),with tons of grapfruit. Finish is resiny,sappy. Very drinkable, though,hopped all to hell. I had a few!","Evansville, Indiana, USA","raindog"
3693,"2004-03-12",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 23, 2005 Small biscuity malt with spruce and orange citrus hops.  This rating isnt very descriptive, but the beer was enjoyable to drink.  It reminded me of a malty APA featuring sprucy hops.

Re-rate 5/23/05.  Bottle.  Clear but dark brown-red body.  Nutmeg/coriander spicy spruce hop aroma with a brownie, deep caramel and butterscot candy malt backing.  Wonderful aroma!  The flavor is a bit of a letdown after the tempting aroma.  The same hops are there but the malt backbone isnt on the same level as in the aroma.  Bitter hops and a bit of dry peat in the finish.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
3693,"2004-03-12",3.5,"On tap: Muddy brownish red with off-white head and good lace. Nice piney and juicy nose with additional hints of caramel, nutty, celery, light spice and earthy yeast esters. The taste starts bitter and buttery. A spicy and toasted malt midsection. The finish was slightly chalky and hinted of grapefruit. Lively and refreshing mouthfeel, smooth. A solid amber to celebrate the upcoming St. Patrick day. Recommended.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
