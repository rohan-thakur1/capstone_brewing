Pours nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big nutty dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, and toasted dark bread; with lighter notes of raisin, plum, currant, vanilla, smoke, char, herbal, wood, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big nutty dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, and toasted dark bread; with lighter notes of raisin, plum, currant, vanilla, smoke, char, herbal, wood, and roast/toasted earthiness. Moderate roast and herbal hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, toasted dark bread, herbal, wood, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; with a great roast/hop bitter/sweet balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from hop/roast bitterness as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding Baltic porter! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Poured out dark brown black. 38ºSRM.

Nose has coffee, charcoal, dark stone fruit, black cherries, honeyed dates.

Mouthfeel is light soap. Palate has black bread, cookie dough, honeyed graham cracker, dates, raw honey. There are flavors of charcoal, burnt barley toast, and a very faint lightly dry ume finish. Burn at the back of the throat. Light phenol right at the very very end, faintly. I do so like the light date tea like flavor, sweet and fruity on the front of the palate. There are also roasted azuki flavors on the palate.

Finish is carbon bitter with the character of good charcoal. Overall, like an aggressive espresso roast. In this Im not sure the ristretto comparison works because the clean bitter, roasted flavors predominate rather than floral or fruity which ristrettos tend to boast.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing.
Body is dark brown to black.

Medium to full body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic. 

Starts out pretty nice with delightful coffee expression and roasty/chocolatey malts in the nose, certainly enticing if too coffee-centric and limited in complexity. In the mouth its harder to enjoy, where the flavor balance is rather harsh (lots of sugar, lots of finishing bitterness, but thankfully fairly low acidity) and the mouthfeel rather thick and syrupy. But...doesnt ""ristretto"" mean confined/limited/narrow in Italian?

This was poured into an English pint glass.
The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a thin white to off white foamy thin head. Semi-thin foamy lacing glosses around the sides of the glass nicely.
The smell had a rich dark espresso to milky chocolate/semi-sweet cocoa bean but also somewhat burnt coffee bean. Decent roast.
The taste tried to follow through on the wanted flavor. Mainly had that roasty to burnt flavor rolling on into the aftertaste. Slight dry/roasty/burnt finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with the burnt/roasty/espresso sort of feel hitting my tongue decently. Hmmm...theres a part of me that wants to say ""excessively,"" hmmm...not bad.

Taste is a weird burnt coffee flavor up front leading to the Belgian-style flavor on the back end. Body is average, not standing out in any way. Honestly Im not a big fan.

1818,"2015-06-02",4.0,"For the un-caffeinated, ristretto is a short shot of espresso with roughly half the amount of water, but the same coffee content as a standard shot. It is to espresso as espresso is to coffee: bolder, fuller, more intense. A pour for coffee purists. The beers colored deep black, topped with a thick layer of froth the density and color of latte foam. Oily coffee beans, molasses, dark chocolate and burnt toast swirl in the nose. The coffee note is knife-sharp, with a hint of tangy fruitiness. Chocolate malts contribute a more cocoa-focused flavor, with nutty, peppery coffee still present, albeit in lesser amounts. Fuzzy carbonation excites the medium-light body, while the alcohol delivers soft, peppery heat and a bit of numbness. A must-try for coffee-lovers.","","PartyFowle"
