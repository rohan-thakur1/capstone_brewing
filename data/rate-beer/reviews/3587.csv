Very light straw colored. Aroma is mild rice aroma, with hints of hay, yeast and some fruits. Taste is slightly dry, yet kind of mild with a round rice flavor, hay, minerals, yeast. Nice warming mild boozy mouthfeel. Fair enough.","Loddefjord, NORWAY","Inbreak"
3587,"2015-06-26",3.1,"A bit fruitier in terms of citrus than most other Sakes. Very popular and generally pretty low priced due to this.

Otherwise some melon and some alcohol. Solid if not super interesting outside of the strong citrus note.

Semi-recommended for fans of heffweizen.","Fair Lawn, New Jersey, USA","KoRoBeNiKi"

3587,"2013-08-13",3.6,"720ml. my fist Saké ever. absolutely clear in the glass, the nose is very fruity (pears, fresh apples, melon, probably banana). The Saké starts dry, fruity, clean. The main part is very fresh and full with fresh fruit aromas like green apples, melons, just like the nose. At the end there appears a bit warming alcohol. The fruityness stays very long till the end of the long aftertaste. 
--> very interesting!!
