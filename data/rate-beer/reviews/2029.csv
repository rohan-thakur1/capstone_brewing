2029,"2015-10-18",3.4,"Love the pink panther! .. . Pours crayon brown .. mild head .. lacing is spotty .. dirt, old coffee grounds, and light chocolate malt .. . pervert .. . Mouth is light and airy, a decent brown but not up to Alaskan quality .. . . You cant just pick and choose which laws to follow. Sure Id like to tape a baseball game without the express written consent of major league baseball, but thats just not the way it works.",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"
2029,"2015-10-15",4.0,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 3/2/2016. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby red/brownish color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, coffee, toast, brown bread, light chocolate/nuttiness, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malts, coffee, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, coffee, toast, brown bread, light chocolate/nuttiness, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/roasted coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, coffee, toast, brown bread, light chocolate/nuttiness, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, coffee, and light earthy hops flavors; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice English coffee brown ale style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, coffee, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
2029,"2015-10-13",3.8,"It pours a clear garnet Brown with a two-finger head of foam. The foam is long-lasting and it leaves some nice lacing behind.

The smell has some caramel malt, some nutty notes, & a touch of coffee. Overall, the sweet wins out.

The taste has some caramel malt sweetness, bit of a nutty character to it, and light coffee. And very much resembles American brown ale, which was what the base beer is.

Creamy smooth mouth feel and its very drinkable.

I am glad the beer allows the Brown Ale to shine through with just the right amount of coffee to make this an interesting brew.

For sure, worthy of trying.","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"
2029,"2015-10-12",3.8,"Bottle: Poured a murky doo doo brown with a carbonated filled tan head. Aroma is malty, spicy, and coffee. Taste is spicy, with rugged coffee and balancing sweet malt.","Wasilla, Alaska, USA","SHIG"
2029,"2015-10-05",3.4,"Bottle, dark amber, cream colored head faded. Aroma coffee, dark chocolate. Taste is coffee, chocolate, cola. Palate is light, carbonation moderate. This is a touch sweet, more like soda than beer, but it does work, and it is tasty.","Eagle River, Alaska, USA","furthur"

2029,"2013-11-24",3.8,"Draft from the latest batch. Clear light brown with a small light tan head. Aroma of doughy malt, coffee, nuts and light cocoa. Flavor is more doughy malt, robust coffee and rich malt. Medium body with a soft, smooth mouth fee. Really nice beer, very malty all around but the coffee adds a nice balance and drinkability.","Anchorage, Alaska, USA","savnac"
2029,"2013-11-07",3.3,"Picked up a growler at Breeze In/Lemon Creek location, here goes:
The appearance is somewhat dark brown colored body with a slight transparency to the body, no head whatsoever no matter how many times I pour it, no worries, its all good, barely any lacing; the aroma has so much coffee in front of all of the malts, nuts, and chocolate, the taste is a smooth sort of Chocolate coffee flavoring, somewhat like someone poured the creamer in the coffee and then poured it in the brew, hmmm ... ok, no worries, its all good for the most part, its very easy on the palate and there is nothing obscure overall, good coffee forward English Brown Ale, Im just wondering how everyone before me has had this when this thing doesnt leave the Juneau area, hmmm ... make me wonder....

2029,"2008-05-14",3.5,"Sample in the Alaskan tap room. This beer is a mostly clear brownish-amber color with a medium beige head that has decent retention. Thin rings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of coffee, roasted malt and nuts. Medium, smooth body with roasted coffee, malt and caramel flavors with some hops in the background. The finish is mild coffee with a lingering roastiness. Pretty good overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
2029,"2008-04-18",3.3,"on tap @ Humpys - I was excited when I heard they were releasing this again.  I thought I might never have a chance to try it.  Pours a amberish brown color, with some ruby highlights, and a small creamy head.  Slightly roasted malty aroma, with some caramel highlights, and a bit of malty sweetbness, followed by some coffee roastiness that I found to be somewhat tame, I was expecting a little more robust bitterness.  A decent effort.","Gulf Shores, Alabama, USA","BlackDonald"
2029,"2007-07-09",3.3,"On tap at Humpys. Confirmed three times by the bar tender that this was a beer made by Alaskan Brewing Co. Was surprised since I had not hear of it before.  Pours a translucent ruby amber/brownish with a smaller off white lacing head.  Aroma of coffee ice cream, some malty sweetness, light roasted malts. Flavor of the same with more nuttiness, hints of coffee, malty sweet yet on the thin side.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
