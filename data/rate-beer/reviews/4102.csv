Poured a lightly hazy medium orange with a small white lingering head and some spotty lace. Aroma has a sweet caramel core, sulfurous wet forest floor funk, lemon and orange, oak is woody but still somehow fresh, with lots of cut grass and leaves. The palate has berries, orange, lemon, green apple, light cider vinegar, a bit of lactic yoghurt builds later on. Lots of oak and even light vanilla in the finish. Funk is kind of weak but present, earthy barnyard character. Light to medium body with that unusually high frothy effervescent carb, must be from the gas setup or some changes in the keg after tapping. Not a bad lambic at all, maybe a bit weak on the finish and not crazy complex or funky, but nice balance of wood, fruit and grass notes.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

4102,"2012-08-06",3.9,"So I bought 5L straight from the brewery to use this for a blend. The lambic was 6 months old then. Somehow I forgot this barrel and it stayed on pretty high temperatures for 6 months (16-17°). So at first I thought that this was going to be all acetic acid but that is certainly not the case. This turned out to be one very good old lambic!
Pours out with a bit of foam due to the barrel pressure but disapears within seconds. Quite normal since this is an older lambic ... .
So the beer is dark orange hazy and quite thick, a bit like an older cantillon lambic. And well, speaking about Cantillon lambic, this one really compares to it. This is really a perfect balance between the sourness, lactic acid (cantillon!) and the barnyard stuff you need in a lambic. Quite dry finish which stays on your tongue far a while.

A big strawberry aromatic note is brought out by a touch of acetic acid in the nose.  The beer is a clearish, copper hue that is quite traditionally flat.  There is a hint of musty yeastiness in the nose as well as a bright pear aromatic note towards the finish and this has a typical Lambic, dank sweaty quality to it.

The beer feels very smooth as it first hits my palate.  It finishes with a light tartness, some oak astringency and a biting quality that is quite light.  Fruit flavors linger with notes of apple and some pear that is even more noticeable.  This has a nice lactic character to it, though it is not quite as apparent as the Mort Subite Oude Lambik that I just had.  A sip of Cantillon Lambic brings out some musty yeast character in this beer.  This really has a nice, subtle, but influencing oak character that seems fairly noticeable.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
