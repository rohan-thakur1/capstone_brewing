1862,"2015-10-24",3.5,"750 swingtop bottle as pictured. Faint aroma of malts and grains. Taste is malt forward with toffee and hay followed up by spicy noble hops. Finishes long and satisfying. Decent brew.","California, USA","X"
1862,"2015-02-25",3.7,"$4.89 750ml swingtop from Costco. Nose is malty and sweet with hints of banana, bubblegum, and floral. Very lightly hazy gold with a medium offwhite head. Flavor is lightly sweet, fruity, and a hint of bitter. Pretty decent take on a heller bock. Consumed alongside an Aventinus for my reference to good bock beers.","Bakersfield, California, USA","IrishBoy"
1862,"2015-02-18",3.5,"Bottle in my hotel room. Pours cloudy deep orange with a large, frothy white head, medium retention with light lacing. Aroma is sweet biscuit and cracker malt, light earthy and spicy hops and a clean lager character. Flavor is moderate sweet malt dominant, light spicy hops and bitterness with a clean lager character and a sweet finish. Medium-full body and medium carbonation.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
1862,"2015-01-04",3.5,"Bottle from Safeway. It pours a nice lightly hazed golden color with an off white head that dissipates rather quickly. The aroma is decent with some lightly toasted grains, hints of honey and very light floral/earthy hops. Pretty well balanced and clean but sorta meh overall. The flavor is better with strong pale malt flavor with touches of honey and medium to strong noble hops. Mostly lemongrass and florals. Seems hallertau driven to me. Pretty crisp, medium bitter finish. The mouthfeel is full, but not too thick considering the ABV. The alcohol is felt a little in the finish, but it actually drinks pretty easy for a high gravity lager. I liked it.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a lightly hazed orange amber color with a huge head of a foamy and thick off white color. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave lots of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is strongest of a wheat and bready smell mixed with a bit of honey sweetness. Along with these aromas are some grainy smells as well as an aroma of hay and some grass. A very light lemon and yeasty smell are there as well, mixing with the rest to produce a somewhat odd and unbalanced aroma.

 Taste  The taste begins with a smooth bready and somewhat sweeter taste with some flavors of lighter fruits and a bit of honey. The lighter fruits are heaviest of orange, but contain other tastes of pear and apricot as well. As the taste advances, some of the wheaty and grainy flavors begin coming to the tongue along with a little bit of a yeasty taste. As the taste advances even further toward the end, some of the grass, hay and lemon that were in the nose come to the tongue as well, with the flavors in the end, unlike the nose, leaving a smooth, somewhat sweet, wheaty and fruity flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is average in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is a bit on the lower side. The body of the beer and lower carbonation are fantastic for the mix of wheat and fruit and make for a wonderfully drinkable and smooth beer.

 Overall  Other than a somewhat odd and unbalanced nose, this was one fantastic and easy drinking brew. Very tasty.","","Darkmagus82"

1862,"2014-05-09",4.3,"750ML ($5.99) This is a seasonal and is pretty good stuff, would like to see this become a regular offering. Really drinkable and a tasty beer. Its obvious why they sell it in such a big bottle :) and the ceramic topper is a nice affect.","California, USA","AAEA"
1862,"2014-05-02",3.4,"Aroma of banana, biscuit, lemon, orange and yeast funk. Appears an orange with a three finger foam. Taste is yeast, biscuit, bready malts, orange, banana and citrus notes. Finish is sugary with hints of caramel. Overall, pretty interesting brew and for over 7% the alcohol is pretty well hidden. Some yeast funk overtones. B rating.","Los Angeles, CA, California, USA","Thisis12ptfont"
1862,"2014-03-13",3.4,"Aroma is very malt forward with a lot of bread and dough character. Hints of toasted bread and cracker. Fairly yeasty aroma with some clove phenolics and faint banana and floral esters. Very light noble hop character. 
Pours a slightly cloudy, golden orange with hints of copper and a very large, pillowy white head that has really good retention. Medium lacing and small legs. 
Flavor is slightly sweet with a strong malt character. Lots of bread, dough and crackers with a slight toasted and graham cracker note. Medium light clove phenolic note with lighter banana and bubblegum. Medium light bitterness and medium light floral, noble hop notes. Light alcohol spice in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is slightly slick. 
Overall an alright beer, but definitely not my favorite style. It is fairly clean without too much yeast character though the aroma is somewhat yeasty. As it warms it becomes sweeter and I pick up more fruitiness. One more style I have rated.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

1862,"2013-09-09",3.1,"Bottle. Super bready aroma, doughy even. Orange-amber beer with a sudsy consistency. An easy drinker I suppose, but definitely dominated by the malt, and a filling drink as you go. Hides its 7.3% pretty well, certainly coming across as a session beer.

1862,"2013-02-07",3.5,"Bottle from Pacific Liquor: Poured a glowing yellow hue with thick amounts of sediment floating around while a creamy smooth white head blew up on top. Aroma is lively with quality malts and yeast and really has me salivating to take my first sip. The drink is bold with grainy malts and slight taste of alcohol and sort of reminded me of an imperial pilsner.  Minor notes of sweetness but has somewhat of a harsh finish. Alcohol gives off a good buzz so it won me over in that sense.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"
