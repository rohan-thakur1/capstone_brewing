1214,"2007-07-09",3.3,"UPDATED: SEP 12, 2007 This actually looks sweet. The body is a blend of dark red, grainy mahogany and shimmering gold. A creamy beige head tops the body and fades slowly, never fully. The aroma is very sweet and moderately alcoholic. Notes of various citrus and nuts are dwarfed by looming ethanol. Anise and vanilla in fleeting clumps. Caramel is pleasant, as is a sturdy hop profile. Light toast conncludes the sensory delve. The alcohol is also too prominent in the flavor. Incredibly heavy sweetness throughout. Other than that, the flavor is lightly bitter and quite good. Caramel and grain notes are top notch. Finishes cloying, sticky and warm, caramel lingering a short while. The mouthfeel is velvety and substantial. Good carbonation level, medium-full body, incredibly sticky and clinging.

1214,"2007-06-25",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2016 Original rating, 7-17-07:

<P>Approximately 4 or 5 oz. pour on tap at the Surly Brewing Company brewery tour as part of the RateBeer Summer Gathering in the Twin Cities, MN on June 23, 2007. Thanks to Omar (MrSurly) for the free sample. I thought I had missed this one and would never get the chance to try it. When I heard that Omar was busting out some ""RateBeer favorites"" for a special tasting after the tour during the Summer Gathering, I was hoping this would be one of the ones featured (no pun intended). While everyone else was drooling over the possibility of trying Darkness, I was drooling over the possibility of finally trying One. (Darkness is awesome, but I had tasted it for the second time just a few days before). My wish was granted. And oh by the way, the tour, general tasting, and RBSG tasting at the brewery were a blast!

<P>Yeasty, floral aroma that is less sweet than I expected. Vanilla scent. Chocolate hints. Certainly not hoppy. Pours a clear, red/amber-brown with a moderate amount of light tan / dark beige head. Produces extensive lacing. Sweet, sugary taste. Fruit punch and berry juice flavors. Reminds me of Barley Johns Barrel-Aged Rosies Ale (Batch 2), which I had tried the previous day; One, however, is not as strong. Perhaps a tad too sweet, if I have one complaint, but by no means offensively sweet. A touch of hops in the finish. Liqueur-like. Very smooth, syrupy, and sticky in the palate. Full-bodied; amazingly thick for a lager (thickest lager Ive ever had). Could stand to be a bit crisper; otherwise, I would have given it a perfect score in the palate segment. If I didnt know this was a lager, I would have sworn it was a sweet barley wine. One is strong across the board and yet another success from Surly, which has quickly and rightfully earned a reputation as one of the best breweries in the world.

<P>Original rating: 7/4/8/4/17=>4.0

<P>Revised review, 2-26-16:

<P>4 oz. pour of the re-brewed version, on tap at Surly Beer Hall. Consumed on 2-18-16. Dark amber. Beige head. Nice color. Dusty, sweet, malty aroma. Plum scent. Malty-sweet flavor. Belgian/German taste. Vanilla. Plum. Dusty. A bit meaty. Medium body, quite light for the ABV. Good, crisp, lager palate. Im not thrilled, but its still a decent beer.

1214,"2007-06-23",3.5,"Omar generously poured this for all of us at the RVSG 2007. It was very dark ruby, not quite brown with a small head of tan. Sweet ripened fruit and brown sugar.

1214,"2007-04-18",3.9,"I remember standing in line at the brewery in Brooklyn Center at 10 am on that very cold Saturday February morning hoping to get one of the Growlers of One. When the brewery finally opened their doors at 12 noon, I was told that only 29 growlers were packaged for that Saturday Gowler Day. Since I was #30 in line, you can guess how I fared out that day.  Luckily it would be two months later when I got to try Surlys One Anniversary brew. Fresh, on tap at the Blue Nile in Minneapolis, (thank you Pigfoot!) Surly One pours a dark cola density brown with virtually no foam head and very low carbonation. Only a sparcely, oily white film appears at the top. Aroma is intense sweet with scents of raisin, overly ripe figs, sweet apple juice, brown sugar, plums, and some black cherry. Flavor is smooth and silky with enormous about of candy sugar and an aftertaste of roasted hazelnuts. Very thick and chewy. Hard to say if this is an American Dark Lager. Its somewhere between a doppleock and a sweet Belgian dark ale. Happy  First Anniversary Surly! Happy to have shared this with you.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"

1214,"2007-01-27",4.0,"On-tap at the Blue Nile, who knew: A limpid ruby brown with nary a head to be found. Hmmm...I sense a malty ""One"", perhaps a skimpy collar and a whispy residue is strewn across the top of the liquid. Lacing minimal within a few strings and spots, but mostly a clear oily-like film is covering alll areas the liquid touches.

Aroma is sweet with a ample dispaly of freshly squeezed fig and raisin paste and a slice of dark candied bread.

Taste is more sweet to go with the smell...and a whole lot more. Its Doppelbock meets Belgain Dark with a good load of super fresh raisin and fig innards, squishy sweet and sticky with dark fruit gum and glues. Nice dark Belgian candy-like tendencies spark and develope as it draws out through the finish. Leaving long sticky sweet stuff all over the palate. Not drenchingly so like mollases or syrup, but with a high, dark sweetness that encompasses the Doppelbock realm. Yet the candy flavors mixed within pull from the malt flavors more then what they can make up for and make for a nice drinkable lager. Or is it an Ale due to its Belgian likeness? Well, what ever you want to call it, or label it, or decide to call it or label it, its a sweet ride, as in sweet with a whole bunch of malts and candy goodness. Its tender and longing with a big sweetness all across its character.

Body is super smooth and silky sticky with all sorts of stuff holding on to your cheeks making for a sweet and heavy, yet, smooth bodied brew. This ""One"" is completely drinkable! The overall sweetness in flavor is a little much after a while, but somehow not bothersome at all as this was still downable enough and really quickly due to its finely crafted soft silky smoothness. Its a pretty decent Doppelbockish-Belgain Dark-thingy-lagered-ale.

1214,"2007-01-27",4.0,"On tap at the Blue Nile. Faint tangy malt, with some wheat sugars and a number of rested cherry pits. Dark ruby and mahogany pour, with little head. Clear and deep. Flavor is an intense chewy amalgamation of brown sugar, bourbon, molasses, black cherry ice cream, nips of cold sherry and lots of bold hazlenut, with wisps of aged pipe tobacco. Fantastic, especially for a lager. The nuttiness is complex and complementing to the bravado of the fruit character, which stays mid-range and sweet. Texture is silky, liquid smooth and bright. Lots of residual sweetness and the candi sugar shows, but it doesnt have any unpleasent cloying qualities. Hops appear as a bit of an afterthought with some long vegetal quality. Theres been some discussion as to what this really is and I think it can be best described as a Belgian Dark Lager. If that makes any sense. I just get a real grasp of the chewy, rich malt complexity of darker belgian beers, with the piquant fruitiness of German Lager techniques, yet a mouthfeel somewhere in between.

The thing I liked the most about this is the way it acted like a chameleon as it passes from the front to the back of the pallete and into the aftertaste.  Plum/raisen up front to sweet molases in the middle with the best part hitting the back with fruit and a very nice, not to strong  alchohol burn which warms your insides but isnt overbearing.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","undsioux7"
1214,"2007-01-20",3.8,"Enjoyed this beer at Winterfest 2007.  I had some trouble picking out the nose on this one, which is surprising for a Surly beer, which usually is defined by its signature hoppy aroma.  Flavor of sweet honey, vanilla, plum/raisin.  Very interesting and different.  Very sweet flavor profile, and while initially not cloying, I reckon it could become that way after a few of these.  Slight alcoholic bite, although nothing off-putting.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"

1214,"2007-01-10",4.1,"""One"", an anniversary lager. (""But dont call it a doppelbock."")
Brewed July 2006, with a blend of 7 different malts and candi sugar.  9% abv, 28 IBU. 

Sample bottle poured into a wide-mouth Belgian chalice. 

Deep mahogany hue. (""Tawny brown"", says the brewer, but were both right.) Slim whitish head.

Aroma: nice and malty, lightly spicy, with prominent notes of raisin and plum. Molasses isnt far off, either. Delicate sweetness.

Taste away: Mmmmm. Thats all Ill say: Mmmmmm

...

...

...okay, seriously, this is quite a slick, delicious treat, and theyre right its not a doppelbock, its unlike anything I can think of at the moment, and I think its brilliant. 
Those dark fruit flavors ride on top, coated with a candyish sheen  and its jostles the realm of the syrupy, but not quite. It grabs hold of the palate with each new sip, drips this sweet concoction all over the palate, coats the senses, then softly fades back, though the beautiful flavor never quite quits. 

Alcohol is not as forward as youd think, going into a 9% lager, but I still would advise against tippling too many!
Finish is long, body is medium to full, and the taste is well-tempered, very sweet, but not too much so, at least not to me. Those who cant  stand a touch of sweetness may not like it. Their loss. 

Happy 1st Anniversary Surly!
