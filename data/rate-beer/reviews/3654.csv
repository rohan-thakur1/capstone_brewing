The finish has light-moderate roast, smoke, and a touch of tobacco. Its medium-full bodied with soft carbonation and mouthfeel.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3654,"2013-07-07",4.5,"Bottle # 01483 and served in my Iechyd Da snifter: Pours a nearly black colour with a fading frothy beige head and minimal lace but some oily tears. The aroma is a symphony of smoke, oak, roast, char, leather, pipe tobacco, bakers chocolate, star anise and peaty earthiness. The taste supports the nose completely with lush malty overtones, fantastic barrel added complexity, smoke and ash, chocolate and sweet pipe tobacco. Hint of nutty and dark fruit appears as well. The mouth feel is slick and lush, warming of course but still remains shocking drinkable. This is a world class beer and a perfect match with almost any rich and heavy Maduro cigar. Get ya some before they are gone.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

The aroma has moderately roasty and oaky notes (more sherry than whisky), hints of soy sauce, liquorice and blackstrap syrup. The flavour is not to sweet, roasty with coffee and liquorice notes, distinct oaky notes, you get an idea that this beer has been matured in a whisky barrel, hints of sherry again. Just a hint of peat smoke. Warming mouthfeel. Very good..","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"

3654,"2013-06-22",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 1, 2015 Bottle #1439. Pours black with very little head that collects at the edges and grabs the glass well. Nice complex aroma of soy, smoke, earthy hops, vanilla, roasted malt and light whiskey. Taste is moderately sweet with lots of soy, whiskey barrel notes, and smoke. Spicy and earthy hop kick in the finish. Well balanced beer. Thin to medium body, oily slick mouthfeel. Overall, its really good stuff. A little thin but goes down so easy for the high abv.  Re-rate 10/1/15 - 2 year old bottle.  Still good but not as good.  Mostly whiskey and smoke now.  Thin body but goes down easy.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
