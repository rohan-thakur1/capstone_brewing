Aroma: Hard to describe. I dont really get any malt or typical aromas, I get a bit of a vinegar smell. Not like a spoiled vinegar, just a very tart sort of aroma presumably from barrels. 6/10

Taste: light to medium sour 6/10

Palate: medium body, oily feel, soft carbonation, sour finish. 3/5

Overall: meh. I love a lot of the Ovila beers, this is kind of a miss for me. Im drinking it and it isnt horrible but I likely wouldnt buy it if it was (still) on the market. The regular dubbel was OK but just a bit off, not nearly as good as Quad. Making that taste more like wine is not a great combo for me. If this had been bourbon or brandy aged Id probably be singing a different tune.

554,"2013-04-06",4.1,"Pours a deep reddish brown, a nice mahogany color. The head is small and beige-ish. Just a thin blanket of bubbles. I dont see any haze or sediment. Once the head fades away, it looks like a glass of brandy or bourbon with a fine ring of bubbles around the edge. The aroma is excellent. It reminds me of Russian River Supplication, more than anything. There are berry and red wine flavors on top of sweet caramels, peaches and an earthy yeast note. It smells like a fancy dessert, maybe a piece of bread pudding with a wine reduction sauce. The taste doesnt quite live up to the aroma, but its close. This is probably the best non-sour wine barrel aged beer that Ive tried. It starts with sweet stone fruits, and caramel malt flavors builds up more refined sweetness. The barrel adds mildly tannic vinous and oak notes. It balances the sweetness wonderfully. It tastes like a non-sour take on a Russian River sour, somewhere between Supplication and Consecration. The finish is caramel, merlot and oak. Mouthfeel is effervescent but not harsh. About medium in total carbonation but it prickles the palate nicely. I came to this beer with relatively low expectations. I havent been a big fan of the previous Ovila beers that Ive tried. They all seemed a bit safe and not quite refined enough. However, this beer is a definite winner. The base beer works excellently with the barrel-aging, and the barrel-aging is particularly well done.

Pours a deep reddish brown with a small-ish head and nice lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is oaky, lightly tart, and fruity. There are notes of cherry and red apple with a nice rich woodiness. 

The flavor is sweet but not cloying, spicy and nicely tart. Some brown sugar and cherry notes along with plenty of oaky character, but everything is balanced and well nuanced.

The aroma is tart but lacto in caracter, possibly the only vineous thing per se.  Caramelish and cofeeish and malty. Strong in alcohol content. A hit to the head if you havent eaten anything.
