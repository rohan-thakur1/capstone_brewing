409,"2017-05-20",3.9,"Aroma is creamy, pine, grassy hops, light citrus, wheat. Appearance is golden, off white head, mostly clear. Taste is pine, cream, wheat, citrus, grass, floral, pretty hoppy and good, wheat and slight malt at the end. Mouthfeel is light crisp carbonation, very spritzy, light body, wheat and pine bitterness aftertaste. Overall, this one is very solid for the style.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"

409,"2017-02-19",3.3,"Clear golden beer. Nice grain flavor. Very clean, slight citrus. Light bodied and smooth, very well made and refreahing, kind of weird and simple at the same time.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Listigovers"
409,"2016-11-06",3.7,"Pour from a 12oz can.Six pack from the Sawyer Garden Center, round back behind Greenbush Brewpub.  Clear golden brew with frothy white head and excellent lacing. Aroma of crisp hops, nice blend of grass and green fruit. Taste has the moderate bready malt that distinguishes a fine cream ale followed by a complex but not overbearing hoppiness bringing crisp fruit, a little grass and spice into the mix. This is really a great cream ale in that it truly preserves the essence of the style while updating the hops profile to reflect current preferences. Outstanding.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","Onslow"
409,"2016-08-19",3.3,"Picked up six-pack from Ridgeview Liquors in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Pours a semi-clear golden pale colored brew with an average sized head that quickly dissipates to a film top and white ring. Aroma of citrus zest, golden grain malt, and a touch of corn. Taste is light bodied, average carbonation with flavors of lemon zest, golden grain malt and a hint of grassy hops. Finish is semi-sweet, typical cream ale with a a touch of lemon zest and grassy hops.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"

409,"2016-07-25",3.7,"Just an awesome unpretentious beer to enjoy while golfing, fishing or enjoying life in sweet summer. Just enough hops to remind you its not Bush Light, just enough cream of corn to make you realize its a real cream ale. Love it.","Garden City, Michigan, USA","UnsofistaCat"
409,"2016-04-14",2.8,"I like it! Maybe its the clever little picture of angry Rabbits on the can, or perhaps the play on words ""Grand Rabbits""...get it Michigan? Well, do you?!

But when you are ready to leap out of the pen that holds you in a lepus like death grip and get your bad self a bellyful of hassenpfeffer down a case of Blatz and before you know it, your ears will be twitching, your nose will be sniffing and you will be willing to go from ""HOLE to HOLE"" like any good rabbit is wont to do.

409,"2015-08-14",3.8,"Not at all consistent with a cream ale (hop-influenced aroma and taste) but quite delicious. Makes me wish my nephews blowout wedding reception in Marquette, MI, was upcoming rather than five years ago so we could visit the brewery (because, really, check out a map and tell me anyone but a Yooper does a Marquette road trip). Enjoyed from a can.",".08 Junction, Wisconsin, USA","mrjaxson"
409,"2015-08-13",3.4,"12oz can from trade with umich03jm. Thanks, Jason! Pours yellow gold with a big lingering white head. Aroma is lemon and fresh cut grass.

409,"2015-06-06",3.4,"Sampled from a can, 
this beer had a medium yellow-gold pour with a touch of haze and presented a white, lasting head for a cover, it left nice spots and rings of lacing on the glass, 

the aromas were average /medium lemon and citrus hops with a little herb, light bread with a bit of grain, and a faint powder sugar like sweetness in the background, 

it had flavors of citrus and spice hops with light bread/grain, and a light sweetness, 
the finish had a light to medium hop bitterness with light malt notes, 

the mouth feel was light and easy, it had average carbonation, 

a light cream beer with nice hops that are very present on the nose and add a nice bitterness to the finish, I thought the hops gave a nice balance to the bread and grain flavors, 
there was little sweetness in this cream ale which I thought made this beer a good drink for when working in the yard, a nice thirst quencher.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"
409,"2015-01-05",3.1,"12oz can poured into a plastic cup. The aroma has a stone / mineral water quality to it, as well as light, dry spices, and oranges late. Its kinda murky and pale with a foamy, creamy white head that leaves lot of lace and retains a thick ring. The taste is a medium bitter and medium sweet. The creamy, oily beer as a soft fizz carbonation, and  a medium light body with flavors of bread, citrus, and mineral water. Theres a light spicy, clove note as well as a crisp tonic water note to the finish finish. Its kinda dry and the finishing notes linger lightly for a brief period joined by a grain-like hint. Clean and refreshing.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"
409,"2014-08-22",3.5,"Can. Pours a hazy pale yellow with a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has notes of citrus and tropical fruits with a sweet grain and a hint of cookie backing. Flavor has sweet citrus with a touch of grass and a creamy grain backbone.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
409,"2014-08-18",3.6,"12oz Can at The Fitzgerald - Eagle River, MI. First of what will be many cans, I hope. This is working for me. A slight orange citrus aroma hop burst right away and then an easy, light and refreshing clean cream ale base follows, without undo bitterness. My memory lacks detail on the malt character, but I remember a lack of house character and straightforward clean pale malt flavor. Looking forward to revisiting.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
409,"2014-07-04",3.1,"Can. First off, funniest name either. Body is a light gold with lots of carbonation and a thin film of a head. Aromas of light lemon and a little honey. Flavor is weak and beery but uninteresting.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"
409,"2014-04-24",3.8,"12 ounce can into pint glass, no canning date. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy golden straw color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, bread, cracker, light honey, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of citrus hop and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of tangerine, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, bread, cracker, light honey, and floral earthiness. Slight earthy floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, bread, cracker, light honey, and floral earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and robustness of citrus hops and pale malt flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good cream ale. Good balance and robustness of citrus hop and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
