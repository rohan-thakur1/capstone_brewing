58,"2015-04-09",3.7,"Bottle, just earlier, @ dining room table. 
Pours black with a small head and some lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is roasty with some chocolate & woodiness. The bourbon presence is mild but certainly detectable in the aroma.

The flavor is nicely bitter & only mildly sweet... most of that sweetness seemingly coming from the vanilla like characteristics of the barrel. Its got a good roasty maltiness and just a mild hint of pepper, but most of the heat here is gone. The bourbon is well integrated, not especially loud, but a decent balancing flavor in the beer as a whole.

58,"2014-02-06",4.0,"The beer pours black with a good-sized light brown head. As I poured, the stream of liquid appeared a dark magenta/reddish brown, and the head kicked up pretty quickly. The aroma is coffee, caramel and cocoa beans with a little peppery kick. Considering the abv, it smells strikingly rich, way bigger than Id expect out of 6.6% abv. The taste similarly seems too big and rich for the alcohol content. Theres a lot of chocolate and a stronger pepper presence. Im not a fan of pepper for peppers sake, but it works in this beer. The pepper blends in nicely with the sweetness, probably adding to that richness by covering lighter flavors, and never gets intense enough to mar the other flavors. The aftertaste has gentle pepper heat, chocolate and coffee. Not to keep revisiting the same theme, but the mouthfeel also feels a lot thicker than Id expect from a beer of this strength. Its rich and full. Just a big mouthful of stout/porter. I tried a barrel-aged of this beer on tap, and while it was good, I definitely prefer this bottle.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Body is huge and carbonation is medium. Overall this a fantastic stout, world class, my disappointment comes in there is little chipotle chili pepper taste, that is what I want in this beer, nice beer, but If this would have had a full pepper taste this would have been one of my highest rated beers.","Idaho, USA","Beerdrinker79"

Side by side with the texas ranger, I was frankly expecting more from the barrel treatment, for what thats worth. The nose provides a caramel, roast, cocoa bean element, but lacking the chili and the bourbon frankly. The flavor profile provides a robust mouthfeel for the abv, like the base beer, but it frankly lacks much zest from the chilis, and much bourbon from the barrel treatment.

When I enter ""Mikkeller Chipotle Porter"" into the Ratebeer search engine, only two options show up: Mikkeller Chipotle Porter and Mikkeller Chipotle Porter (Eagle Rare Edition), so its the latter that Im going with here since this is barrel-aged. The label is yellow with a pistol on it. Says ""Ale Brewed with Chipotle Chili & Aged in Bourbon Whiskey Barrels"" on the left side of the label. Someone correct me if Im wrong. Aroma consists of chocolate, chilies, black coffee. Completely black pour with one of the darkest tan heads Ive ever seen on a beer; after it recedes after a few minutes, decorative lacework is left on the glass. Taste is the same as the aroma descriptors, but the bitter chocolate flavor is strongest; theres a faint spicy burn in the finish. Tobacco and leather flavors come out after it warms up a bit.

58,"2013-05-26",4.1,"Appearance:
Dark burnt blacks and charcoal under a decent tan head which fades into a thin collar bordering specs of foam. Swirls with a bit of lace while releasing a massive nose.

Nose:
Massive roast and toast and charred notes. Black chocolate, cacao nibs, chocolate brittle, black stone fruits. Leather and char. Dried and slightly charred chipotle peppers glide along the edges.

Palate:
Medium weight with a creamy mouthfeel; a trait I have noticed in past Mikkeller beers that I find truly enjoyable. Chipotle heat in the back is a gentle caress of fire-roasted peppers dipped in dark chocolate. Generic burnt roastiness in the finish. Tongue tingles with lingering warmth and spice. Brittle roasted cacao nibs underneath. Dark stone fruits dipped in chocolate in the middle and on top.

Final Thoughts:
Another fine brew from Mikkeller, the Wandering Brewster. Seriously, this gentlemans beers are always unique and always out of the world delicious. Neither overly complex nor too simple, the Texas Ranger Barrel Aged brew was just right and packed with flavor. If you happen to come across this beer, or any Mikkeller beer for that matter, buy as many as you can. Your tastebuds will thank you for it.

The 37.5cl bottle pours with a nice deep dark body that supports a nearly creamy mocha head of foam that leaves behind spotty lacing. The aroma offers up dark roasted malts, chocolate and rich milk chocolate milk shake. This smells mighty nice. The taste is rich and deep and silky with velvety dark chocolate mixing with dark roasted malts and some malt sweetness. To midway it picks up additional notes of modest chili pepper, sweet smooth and mild bourbon booze notes and wood as well as a bit of a mineral sensation. Into the finish the chili pepper gives up just a dash of warmth in the throat. This comes together pretty darn well.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Vinous, sweet brandy, Bourbon; black chocolate, charcoal, but also something fresh, as cilandro. In the background an aroma that is partly vanilla, partly red chilli pepper. Inviting - dangerous. Black chocolate, tobacco, roasted. Fairly sweet. Deep-roasted malts, vanilla and only faraway peppery impression - quite restrained, which is good. Capsicum flavour retronasal. Tittilating, hot-ish & warming, very slick; medium to well bodied. Quite good indeed.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

58,"2013-03-01",3.6,"375 bottle (BB Brevinga, Riga)
Initial aroma after pouring is full of the bourbon barrel vanilla with a touch of butter, later it fades to digestive biscuits - sweet biscuity grains, and even some saltiness. Apple retronasals, some burnt roast, bit of butter too. In the mouth theres way more roast, that dominates - its nice and sweet. Smooth palate, gentle carbonation. Slight milky creaminess (is that a hint more vanilla?) in the finish, and a gentle chilli hint. Not well integrated, and not as good as the normal texas ranger. Now I want the original to rerate, as Im sure it was more than .1 better than this. Not that this is bad, its very nice, but its a perfect example of barrel ageing not making things better.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

Une série qui continue à ma faire plaisir et me réconcilie un peu avec Mikkeller. Comme quoi on peu boire qcq chose de complexe sans pour cela être noyé dans des bières fortes.
Couleur brune, col crémeux moka épais.
Arôme est malté, note de bourbon bien là avec un bouquet de piment juste en bon dosage. Le tout couplé deffluves chocolatées qui se mélangent superbement à lEagle Rare/bourbon et ce léger côté boisé avec en retrait un subtile ajout fumé/tourbe. 
Palais est impressionnant, et me plaît plus que larôme. Le bourbon est en retrait mais assez présent que pour donner une dimension agréable à la bière. Profil malté chocolaté avec un fini terreux, pointe dépice et de piquant venant des différents chillies utilisés; notamment chipotle pour une fin de bouche réchauffante. Touche de barrique, malt grillé, caramel, pointe de biscuité et chocolat, le tout entremêlés avec ce profil boisé/chêne et bourbon. Sur la fin, le bourbon couplé avec les malts devient presque noisette-vanille avec un léger fini chocolaté.

Bref, un vrai plaisir à déguster, le tout lentement avec un bon morceau de chocolat.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
