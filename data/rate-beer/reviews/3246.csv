3246,"2017-03-21",3.2,"I am supposed to be enjoying this but hmmmmm. 

Thought I'd try this triple tipple, and boy it looks lovely in the glass. With a pleasing fizz and ever so slightly hazy, the amber liquid has a tinge of an orange hue. The two finger frothy off white head lasted longer than Willy Wonkers gobstopper. 

The nose is bubblegum and bread with a inkling of indistinct malty aromas. 

The sparkling appearance translates into the mouth with a medium body and a burst of bubbles that pleases the palate. 

The hops bring a sharp, acerbic attack up front, whilst this persists throughout, closely behind is metallic dryness on the tongue like the bottom of a parrot cage. Slowly some subtle malt hints of caramel glide in and then gently warming spices but not enough to dismiss the bitterness. 

 Although it scores high in the popular perception of classic Belgian beer somehow I am less than impressed, I expect it's just a personal preference.","Nottinghamshire, ENGLAND","Onesimus"

Entre puissance et douceur, cette triple sait trouver un équilibre juste. De couleur blond doré et paré dun léger voile, elle est surmontée dune mousse blanc crème de 2 à 3 cm dépaisseur saffaissant au long de la dégustation pour se maintenir à quelques mm en fin de dégustation. Le nez est avant tout sur les céréales avec un brin de coriandre. Lattaque est toute en souplesse et douceur sur les céréales et avec des arômes de fruits rouges. La deuxième attaque est splendide. En parallèle apparaissent 1.la puissance de lamertume, sur des arômes dorange et de girofle, tout en intensité et 2. des arômes de sucre candi et de fruits jaunes donnant de lampleur à la bière, tout en douceur et suavité. Lensemble est dune parfaite homogénéité avec des arômes sintégrant parfaitement. La corpulence est excellente avec un sucre résiduel bien présent (un tantinet trop à mon goût, mais cela ne peut en rien être objecté à notre triple) et lalcool sintègre parfaitement, montant crescendo vers un final long présentant quelques notes épicées.

3246,"2016-06-30",3.7,"Chimay Tripel, with its typical golden colour, its slightly hazy appearance and its fine head is especially characterised by its aroma which results from an agreeable combination of fresh hops and yeast. The beers flavour, as sensed in the mouth, comes from the smell of hops: above all it is the fruity notes of muscat and raisins that give this beer a particularly attractive aroma. The aroma complements the touch of bitterness. There is no acidity, but an after-bitterness which melts in the mouth. This top fermented Trappist beer, refermented in the bottle, is not pasteurised.

3246,"2014-12-30",3.8,"11.2 oz bottle into a Chimay goblet.

A: Pours a murky copper color. The head is about two fingers high, and off-white in shade. Im really impressed with its retention in particular. A decent amount of lacing is left behind.

S: This has a very pleasant creamy aroma compared to other tripels - having said that, it seems to subdue some of the fruity esters some. There are some good banana notes, though. Black pepper and doughy yeast help round out the aroma. Im a little disappointed over the fact that it doesnt really open up when allowed to sit.

T: The flavor of this tends to lean more toward peppery than fruity. After the initial pepper flavors, it finishes with a nice cream note. I swear theres also something on the back end suggesting noble hops, too. Or maybe its just clove. Whatever it is, I really enjoy this beers mellow bitterness and subdued sweetness; my only real complaint here is that the fruit esters tend to be too understated at times.

M: Like most good Belgian ales, the dry finish is really pleasing. The relatively full body helps take the edge off of the intense carbonation, too. This isnt particularly chuggable, but it is very easy to sip. It certainly doesnt taste/feel like 8% by any means.

O: Honestly, this might be my favorite of the three Chimay beers. And to think I expected this one to be my least favorite! It isnt terribly complex, but it is very enjoyable to savor. This is the only one Id go back to on a regular basis.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Strong, yeasty aroma with scents of orange, lemon, honey, challah, and apple cider. Pours an initially clear, dark gold. Highly effervescent. Large amount of creamy, off-white head. Produces good lacing. About as good-looking as a golden-colored beer can get. The latter pour is cloudy tan and with much suspended particulate and thick head. The latter pour also looks quite appetizing and appealing in a different way. Bready, vegetal, dry, sophisticated, very nice taste. Flavors of tobacco, candy sugar, caramel, orange, and a touch of booze. Dry finish. Medium body. Fluffy and frothy in the palate. Good Belgian ale palate effects. This is the type of beer that is brewed only in Belgium and makes all but the best American takes on Belgian-style beers look like pale imitations. It has been too long since I have had a Trappiste ale outside of my Orval and Rochefort staples. This beer reminds me that, with all the innovative beers young American breweries are pumping out, Belgian monks still make some of the best beers on the planet. Chimay White is a lovely and complex classic with no weaknesses. Its nice when a beer has those flavors that you cant actually describe but that you can ascribe only to a great brew.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

3246,"2014-10-11",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 25, 2014 The former white Chimay (Blanche), renamed Triple some years ago to avoid confusion with witbier. Poured in its own glass, it shows a thick, cream white, dense and moussy head with good retention and leaving delicate lacing on the edges. Colour is a beautifully warm orange blond, cristal clear with a steady column of bubbles rising up from the bottom and supporting the opulent head; with deposit, it becomes an equally clouded, light and warm orange. Strong and characterful aroma, impressions of both fresh oranges and orange peel, ripe peaches, rosemary, cheese, thyme, single malt, soap, cloves, grass, banana, coriander, strawberry, some sweaty grains as it warms up and a very faint kind of saltiness. In the mouth, citrus freshness and exotic fruits constitute the onset, with a sharpish, sourish, minerally carbonation, after which a tangy spiciness takes over (coriander is quite noticeable), all built on a smooth, soft, mellow, caramelly maltiness with the very vague salty touch from the aroma peeping through; the finish is long and well-structured, with some spices and citrus persisting, but dominated by a peppery, leafy hop bitterness drying the throat along with some warming, whisky-like alcohol. I know this brewery has received criticism for speeding up brewing in order to increase sales, and making compromises on quality in the process; though I cannot but agree with this criticism, I still recognize this beer as one of the leading examples of its style. This is what a tripel ought to be: malty, fruity, rich and opulent, with enough hops in the finish to balance out the sweetness. I did not find any obvious flaws - and I do not expect to find those, considering the reputation trappist beers have to live up to. Great classic, also in the 75 cl version called ""Cinq Cents"", which has good ageing potential (though I usually recommend to consume tripels at young age, there are other beer styles more suitable for ageing - Chimay Grande Réserve, for example).","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

 Poured from bottle into a chalice glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a cloudy yellow-orange amber color with a one finger white head of a more fizzy nature. The head has a lighter level of retention, fading over about a one minute time frame, to leave a light level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is of a bready and biscuit nature mixed with a moderately strong yeasty and orange citrus smell. The yeast with it bring some nice spice aromas of coriander and clove mixing with some banana smells as well.

 Taste  The taste begins with a lighter bready flavor mixed with a moderate amount of orange citrus flavor. As the taste moves on the orange dries out some with lots of yeast and spice of clove and coriander coming to the tongue. As the orange gets lighter it is replaced by a light banana taste as well as some grassy and herbal hop flavors. Overall the taste gets rather dry at the end and when combining with a bit of an alcohol flavor it leaves a dry and yeasty bread taste to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the medium to slightly thinner side for a brew of 8 % abv with a carbonation level that is on the higher side with tons of prickly carbonation bubbles. The feel is very nice for the style with the slightly thinner body making it very drinkable and light in composure and with the prickly carbonation level accentuating the spice and hop taste all in all making for a more exciting drier champagne like feel which match the tastes well.

 Overall  A classic triple for a reason. It is dry and yet exciting brew with a drier, moderately yeasty, lightly hopped and nicely spiced flavor.","","Darkmagus82"

3246,"2014-09-14",4.3,"This is my least favorite Chimay....which means it is better than over 90% of beers anyone will ever have. Pours a hazy straw color with a head that never seems to truly go away. There is always more than a lacing. It is a sweet beer with malt, but there is a slight presence of hops, and a feeling on the tongue that I can only describe as peppery. Unsure if that is the carbonation in it that makes that tongue tip tingle slightly or not. 

I have had this a few times, and usually when I get a Trappist beer, this is not the one I choose (Grande Reserve usually gets grabbed first), but I am glad I did grab this one along with some cheeses I bought. Paired nicely and it reminded me that this still is a stellar beer.

3246,"2014-06-06",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 8, 2014 Several times on tap, now getting some review notes from the bottle. Pours a large nice creamy head, dark golden hazy colour. Actually doesnt smell neither tastes nothing special or particularly definite, rather than typical belgian tripel notes: malts, yeasts, sweet notes, spices turning to a good balanced bitter.
I find the tap version to be a lot more intresting, complex, tastier and better overall, sort of more spiced and aromatic. I dont have any specific notes about it, but the on tap version is easily among my preferred tripels. The score is almost entirely due to the tap version, actually I finded the couple of bottles I tried a bit disappointing compared to the draught.","ITALY","brianza_ale"

Mysterious perfumed Belgian flavour with the impression of mandarin and maybe passion fruit hop but all from yeast and spices of course. Coriander, kumquat and lace. Bitter and husk-hinting for a Trappist; kind of a Trappist DIPA.

3246,"2014-02-08",3.8,"11.2oz bottle poured into a goblet. Strong banana and clove aromas jump out right after I finished pouring. This was accompanied by the smell of fresh baked bread, some hints of vanilla and some spices (some black pepper perhaps?). Near mid-glass, the dominant aromas turns to raisin and honey. It pours a hazy, straw gold color with a creamy, pillowy white head that retains well and leaves a decent amount of lacing down the side of the glass. Medium levels of sweet and bitter balance nicely on the tongue with maybe a touch of sour (maybe a touch of astringency?) tucked away in there. Its a medium-full body beer that feels syrupy smooth, creamy and buttery going down - helped in part by a soft carbonation. Some buttery and caramel flavors come forward on the tongue with some berry and light fruit flavors. It finishes somewhat dry, but clean, with a mellow roastiness and some resin qualities as well as a light alcohol warmth. The roasted and resin qualities stick around for awhile in the aftertaste.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

3246,"2014-02-02",3.1,"Bottle in Jerusalem. Exp date: 2014. Already looks hazy even in the bottle, with lots of sediment floating near the bottom. Pours a pale lemony orange, hazy, with a finger of yellowish white frothy head. Carbonation in the glass is calm. Aroma is subdued initially -- some skunk, more vegetables, spicy, some grassy hopes as well. Not particularly appealing and even somewhat unappealing. As the beer warms, though, it develops a soft butter-on-a-fresh-roll aroma thats quite rich and pleasant. Taste is lemony and champagne-like with a mildly bitter finish that leaves a slightly sour note on the back of the tongue. However, it becomes sweeter as the beer warms, suggesting butterscotch, but not really anything to write home about. Body is medium with high carbonation. Lacing is decent.

She pours a decent hazy golden orange color and leaves the same colored body with a finger and a halfs worth of foamy head that rises just a bit and falls leaving some sporadic foamy lacing in its wake.
The aroma is bready and fruity - more so with that normal ""iced apples"" thing I always get in most Tripels. Light spices round her out a bit.
The taste is spicy and sweet all the way through the entire beer with an ""iced apple"" aftertaste and a dry spicy finish. On the palate, she sits about a light to medium, comes across somewhat sessionable. The ABV seems to hide itself pretty well. The carbonation is there but still has a nice smooth quality to it but not so much as the harshness is there but not overly done.

Snagged this a couple of years cheaply due to mislabelling; obvious yeast coming into suspension in the bottle.
Pours a murky orange gold body holding a dense white head.
Spicy aroma; white pepper, clove, stewed apple and pear, sour cream, light candy sugar, bit of Camembert funk and cereal grain.
Thin on the palate, distinctly so, age taking its toll. Dry overall, the abv is an afterthought.
Palate doesnt deliver as much as the nose promises, but still plenty of spicy phenolics, light fruity esters, and mild cheesy funk. Low bitterness to finish, dryness to finish.

Flavor starts of light acidic with fruits, then goes to yeasty to finish off with bitter and warming alcohol. A very good and enjoyable tripel.
Together with Chimay a la biere cheese the yeast of the beer is pushed away and most of the bitter, leaving a very fruity beer. The cheese also loses bitterness and becomes softer and more fruity. A fresh combination, but complexity of the beer is lost.

The beer is on the chewy side of medium bodied with a very smooth mouthfeel and a velvet finish.","Eastanollee, Georgia, USA","Malty_MacHops"

3246,"2012-05-12",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 6, 2012 ORIGINAL MAY SAMPLING NOTES: Pours to an impressive white head and nice light, golden color at the bottom of the glass.  Smell is yeast, nutmeg, and citrus, in that order of pungency.  Flavor is light initially, yeast and nutmeg, then more of a hops-kick (yet not overly bitter), and more of the same.  Super crisp.  Perhaps not quite as complex as their Grande Réserve or Première, but still outstanding.  After-flavors are banana clove and bread.  OCTOBER TASTING: Once again impressed.  Head is again fantastic - very billowy, and great carbonation with this one.  Lacing is more sporadic.  Aroma is so clean and pure - yeast and nutmeg, as I mentioned before, although the hops are less citrusy this time for me and more grassy.  Alcohol also hits harder than I recalled - really get a burn in the finish.  Still, cant complain too much about this one - a well-balanced tripel that doesnt over-assault with acidity as some in the style can tend toward.  Probably still my second favorite in the style after Corsendonks - I liked Samuel Adams New World a lot as well, but its a bit dark and peppery for the style label.","Missouri, USA","kdm1984"

Its just bread, cereal, nuts, toast, roast, coffee, hay... all but nothing too much. The fruitiness isnt too raisin-like, its more like spruce - fresh, but very mildly. The end is a bit bitter, but I guess you cant help it, and its still very mildly bitter.

3246,"2012-03-13",3.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/10/2011.  Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a Chimay branded chalice.

My pour out of the bottle has a murky faded golden color with a tangerine tint. An ever-rising taupe head that exhibits a typically Trappist bubbly carbonation. Sheets of lace coat the glass on the way down.

The aroma has a full bready aroma. Full cereal grains, honey, Belgian spicy yeast, and some cloves.

The grains come on pretty strong to begin each sip. Somewhere between biscuity and bready, some honey and light caramel sweetness comes in next. The estery yeast adds a nice spiciness, but the flavor loses steam toward the end. There is an annoying metallic taste that comes in toward the end, and the malt sweetness seems to have run out of steam. I noticed the same metallic taste on tap, but I figured I would give a bottle a chance in case it was a one time problem. It is not.

The carbonation here follows the typical lively Belgian style. Very full and bubbly, it almost seems to scrub the tongue and remain somewhat creamy at the same time. There is a rugged graininess that is a clear result of the brewing style. Overall the body is on the fuller side of medium, but it is smooth enough to drink fairly easy.

Chimay had such a cache for me when I first started into the craft beer scene. But after having quite a few great Belgians and trying some of the more creative American styles, this tripel just leaves a bit to be desired. The carbonation is a bit out of control, and the slight metallic flavor towards the end is a turn off as well. At this point there are a few readily available tripels I would rather have.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

19/09/2012 ho riassaggiato questa chimay alla spina..la conclusione è che la birra in bottiglia che ho assaggiato tempo prima (giudizio sopra) aveva qualcosa che non andava,forse avendola tenuta in magazzino e in cattive condizioni si è rovinata (ipercoop) perchè quella che ho assaggiato ieri sera è LA tripel..è assurda,partendo dallaroma che sviluppa (lieviti,luppolo fresco,malto profumato,fruttata, leggermente alcolica,perfettamente da tripel),passando per il gusto (pieno,dolce,luppolato,ha davvero tutto) e finendo col retrogusto,del quale non mi stancherei mai,lungo e bilanciato tra dolce e luppolato...altissimi livelli,una birra storica che cambia totalmente il mio giudizio!

A pleasant flavour but not really full enough, tastes of sustained gentle bitterness, grassy hops, well masked alcohol, cereal, malts in the back and a white pepper taste which is a bit too prominent and the aftertaste is mainly bitter hops and cereal.

Banana & clove mix upfront coupled with some yeast and a lot of spice. Not what I was expecting when I picked this one up but very nice indeed. There is some nice citrus and good hops to round this one off.

Hazy golden orange colour with a massive, part foamy and part bubbly white head that looks quite rough. It slowly recedes in size from about three-fingers width to about a thin lace.

Citrus & clove to start with followed by some hops and Belgian yeast. There is a lot going on with this beer, some strong dark fruit flavours hit around the middle and maybe some pear too.

Medium, smooth and well carbonated, there is also a nice citrus sting upfront with this beer. It has a strong hops presence and also has a good feel to it.

Chimay never disappoints. Perhaps not there strongest offering when compared with the Rouge or the near perfect Bleue, this is by no means a failure and goes down very well indeed.

Nose : Hop freshness with some light notes of fruits like peach and apple. Honey aroma reveals sweetness of malt. 
Sip : Nice body with a fine carbonation that might get fluffy if poured gently. Malt goes out in a bearable sweetness of a typical tripple beer and ends up with a little pinch of bitterness. Its like a signal that weares off leaving a great harmony. After couple more sips I sense some little banana and pepper notes too which doesnt surprise me neither for this kind of beer. 
What I enjoy in it is mostly the richness of micro aromas that I could dig and dig but all that contained in an intelligent brew (read harmonious) and still refreshing. Its like Yoda of tripple beers.","Warszawa, POLAND","Swaroga"

Back then, I was 4 months into my beer journey, a sucker for classic hype beers, and generally just excited to find a decent rateable craft beer while I was overseas. Seems like Im due for a revisit. 750ml bottle, from Dutchs. Cork is dated 2014. Enjoyed from my Chimay Goblet. Mostly clear orange color. Hazy in later pour, with some dark sediment at the bottom. Bigger, finger.5 white head, kind of foamy, retains well. Leaves nice splotches of lace. Really does look great. Flavor is mild and uninteresting, though. Just kind of bready, kind of spicy, peppery, mildly musty, not really much else to it. Just a touch of funk. Mild paperiness. Drinks like a slightly rough saison, with a little more malt sweetness. Not much in the way of fruity ester or complexity sadly. Bigger sweet taste, light to moderate bitter. Dry finish, very mild warmth on the finish. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, kind of soft, light carbonation. Touch of roughness to the texture, overly dry maybe. A touch of orchard fruit comes out later. Just disappointing. Why is the added sugar necessary? It feels a little noticeable. Maybe its better fresh? I doubt it. I think this is just what you get when you mass-produce and rely on ""trappist"" marketing for sales.

It pours a hazy deep golden/amber liquid with little yeast particles everywhere and a precious and huge not-entirely-white pillowy head that lasts throughout the beer and leaves some lacing. One of the best-looking pale beers. The aroma is extremely complex, with hints of green grapes (muscat) , citron (both lemon and orange), grassy and floral hops, loads of yeast, raisins, and a very nice malty base, with some distant notes of coffee. I can even smell a little pineapple and strawberries when it has settled for a while. The flavour is very strong: muscat and citron, dough, grassy hops and a notorious honey/caramel maltiness that compensates deliciously the general hoppiness of this brew. It is somehow sweet, with a very nicely scented palate and both lively and softly carbonated. It finishes dry, leaving a very bitter aftertaste, with grassy and floral hops.

Im not sure if this is the most visually appealing beer ever made, or if it
was my newly bought trappist chalice that made this brew look so gorgeous: a white, creamy, fully lasting head floats on top of the beautiful medium amber,almost clear body. Spices, perfume, citrus, pine and yeast in the aroma. The taste is light bitter, but somehow it magically transforms into a long, sweet aftertaste with honey flavours. Also a hint of banana in the flavour. Medium body, lively carbonation.

To celebrate our new house I open a Chimay Triple, knowing that Im in for a treat. It turns out that I like this beer even better now than when I first rated it. Not surprisingly it looks rather similar to what it did last time, even it I would describe the body as slightly hazy. The lacing is excellent. How I could give this a 6 for the aroma is beyond my belief, its fantastic! Spices, yeast, citrus, herbs, honey, light fruits, banana, peach, pineapple and vanilla! Both sweet and dry with spicy herbs. Wow, thats what I call complex! Up from 6 to 8. Moderate bitter initial taste, along with a light bitterness and a vague touch of acidity. The acidic touch is also present in the finish, but a medium to light bitterness dominates. Very long aftertaste with a peppery dryness. The flavours are as plentiful as the aromas: spices, herbs, resin, honey, and light fruit. The alcohol is clearly present and Im glad it isnt hidden: it gives the brew a vinous exclusiveness that makes me want a Chimay Triple for next new years eve instead of a champagne. I think I prefer the beer at the warmer end of the recommended temperature scale, i.e. at least 8ºC, since this brings forward the sweet honey flavours. Taste up from 7 to 8. Medium to full body, oily to sirupy texture and medium to lively carbonation. A good mouthfeel, but I dont think it deserves a 5: Palate down to 4. Overall up from 14 to 15. A magnificent beer!

3246,"2011-02-07",3.4,"Served on tap.  A slightly hazy golden beer with the usual triple head shortened by the rather chilled pour.  Nose is firstly of candied sugar and spices then comes the rich yeast backbone, all fruity and soft.  There is a light buttery character that works well with the yeast and this develops in the mouth.  Here the spices are joined by an almost herbal flavour; then the malt comes back with a honey edge, merging into that candied sugar.  The mouth feel is medium with a soft carbonation.  It finishes towards the malts and yeast, edging towards an almost bitter mid-palate.  Finally theres a return to the spices.  Very nice.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","theSlipperyPen"

3246,"2010-11-13",3.8,"Transcription of an old BA review from 01-04-2010, with scores adjusted to RB scale. Will re-rate...someday.

The label says best before 2012. Into Chimay calice.
Effervescent ,mostly clear honeyish golden-orange fluid topped with rich white head that retreats until a firm thick lacy coating is left. The scent is a composite of peppery phenolics, aromas of peach /apricot, refined sugar and quite evident spicy alcohol. Somewhat yeasty with peppery phenolics and flavors of peach /apricott incorporated into the malty body balanced by some hops and subdued spicy alcohol. High carbonation is leading into dry finish with prominent bitter aftertaste that seemingly lasts forever. Although the beer seems hoppier in character than most trappist ales, hoppiness is quite shy until the aftertaste phase when reveals itself as an everlasting bitterness. This beer is a shirk which escapes my attempts to evaluate it: aromas and flavors are somehow hard to take hold of. The apparent absence of citrusy esters so typical of a triple and the pronounced dryness remind me more of a golden strong ale than a triple. Sharp-edged,prickly on the palate and rather dry the Chimay White is my least favorite of the three brothers.","SLOVENIA","EvilBuddha"
3246,"2010-11-09",3.6,"Pours out a hazy golden colour with a creamy white head, great retention and ok lacing. Aroma is pretty sweet. Im getting floral hops, candy apple, raisins, and fresh pear.

3246,"2010-10-30",4.1,"750 ml bottle poured into tumbler, compared side by side with Westmalle Tripel and the rest of the Trappist beers Ive drank tonight.

Retention is awesome. Aroma is woody, cheesy, ripe fruit, citrus powder drink, a bit phenolic, funky; complex. Taste is lightly sweet with no bitterness; could use more flavor--I was expecting more after the aroma. More highly carbonated than the Westmalle, but still just a medium level of it. Medium-high body. Overall, pretty equal to the Westmalle in quality, but definitely different. This was always my least favorite Chimay.

A - Hazy golden orange color, somewhat like a dark cream soda. Fairly large, foamy, creamy white head. Decent retention with a thin patchy bubbly lacing.

S - Fairly typical Tripel aroma with some peachy, apricot, and other golden fruit. Good amount of orange citrus and floral aroma. Sweet honey and malt aroma also present with some yeast and spice.

T - Starts with an apple and pear taste with some light pale malt in the background. This gives way to more of a peach and apricot fruitiness. Mid to late sip some floral and earthy hops come out along with some spice (coriander, clove, and pepper). Underneath all that is a slight candi sugar/honey sweetness and some Belgian yeast. Touch of alcohol taste on the finish.

M - Medium body with a lot of carbonation. Warming, tingly feel.

D - Decently drinkable. A bit more spiced/hot and less sweet and fruity than others in the style. These dont overpower the palate, but they definitely make their presence felt. Pretty well balanced and could drink another just fine.

Notes: Vintage 2009. More spiced/herbed/hot version of a Tripel with less fruity/peachy sweetness. Its a good beer and enjoyable to drink but it isnt really my favorite Tripel.

The hops are marginally more pronounced in the finish, but it is still far too sweet. The ingredients list for this beer does include added sugar; significantly it comes above the hops, which are not in fact actual hops, but merely an extract. Hence, it is hardly surprising that this tastes far more like a sticky wine than a beer. I must confess, I am disappointed by this. Having read the reviews, and heard good things about Trappist abbey ales, I was expecting something pretty excellent, and this just isnt. It is passable, but it really isnt that great. I guess it makes a good argument for secularism really. It certainly makes the separation of church and beer seem a good idea.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"

Pretty light aroma with some grass, citrus, and yeasty funk.  Malty, medium bodied, and crisp.  The hops contribute a bitter shimmer that lingers into the aftertaste.  Earthy, malty and affectionately bitter.  Unlike most abbey ales this has no esters to speak of.  A good brew whose quality is pretty close to the other Chimays.","USA","Slipstream"

Medium bodied on the palate, with a moderate to strong bitterness in the finish. Considering the high ABV (8%), it is quite smooth and does not taste of alcohol as strongly as I expected.

3246,"2010-04-20",4.4,"A- Translucent golden yellow body with 1/2 finger creamy white head. Great head retention-lasted through the entire glass. Leaves plenty of lacing behind. Lots of tiny bubbles can be seen rising to the top giving this tripel a very champagne-like appearance. Tiny yeast flakes can be seen suspended within the body.

S- Grapes dominate the nose. Behind the grapes is a balance of spicy yeast, floral hops, and citrus, peppery spices, and alcohol.

T- This flavor is full and complex. Sweet fruitiness of grapes and citrus is upfront-but is not dominant as the nose suggests. It is very well balanced with a background of spicy belgian yeast. Spices and the taste of floral hops present themselves for the finish but quickly disappear. Sweet, bready yeast lingers with a very low alcohol after burn.

P- Light carbonation and medium weight body. Smooth and creamy.

O- This was a very delicious brew but after one I was ready to move on to something else. This was excellent and my first Trappist beer. I will definitely have this one again. I even bought myself a Chimay chalice to enjoy it in at home.

3246,"2010-02-20",4.0,"Another Trappist classic, the Chimay Blanc (White) is a tripel which is, first and foremost among the most drinkable of all the tripel beers. It is fruity, sprouting with funky yeasts and hops, while still retaining the sweetness level needed for almost anyone to ""get into the groove"". Because this is a groovy Trappist beer. I can only imagine the monks getting out on a bright summer day, praising the Lord as they collect the hops and malts to break out this brew. It is mild, yet heavy on the palate - just to remind you of its 8% ABV which couldve been easily ignored otherwise. Really tasty and a great introduction to the world of triples - or Trappist beers in general. People say the Westmalle Tripel is the original tripel (and therein lies an expectation of greatness), but this is way better in my view.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"
3246,"2010-02-19",4.4,"If you ever want to sound like a beer snob simply drop the word Trappist into conversation and youll be immediately dubbed a connoisseur by anyone within earshot. Of course, this really only works if the persons hearing that word know that Trappist beers are often ranked among the best of the best of the best beers in the world, and as such they are for discriminating tastes only (or so the hegemony would have us believe).I think its a shame that a product with a rich, complex palate is something to be frowned upon by the mainstream (this is why I believe the average person prefers drinkability to genuine satisfaction  but thats a subject for another sermon). For all the people that would think that way I would point them to Chimay White. This is an authentic Belgian Trappist beer that is indeed rich and complex. However, what separates it from most brews of the style is how drinker-friendly it is. This is a tasty, smooth beer that masks its potency extremely well. You dont have to be a connoisseur to enjoy it, just someone that likes a delicious beer.APPEARANCE AND AROMABeing the beer geek that I am I poured a 750ml bottle of Chimay White into my official Chimay chalice and was surprised the beer produced a thick layer of off-white, spongy head. The body is bright orange but extremely hazy, although no sediment is present. Carbonation is noticeable, but is obscured due to the foggy appearance.The aroma is rather sweet and fruity  like a basket of peaches and nectarines. I also get a slight floral scent from the hops and some hints of spice (probably clove) from the yeast and malts. Despite its potency, alcohol is not detectable in the nose at all.TASTEI have had a few North American-style tripels before and while I enjoyed the complexity to their palates, I was a little off-put by the intensity of their palate. Chimay White is similar to those beers in taste, but its actual palate is much more inviting.Off the bat I get a soft creaminess from the head, followed by a sweet and somewhat citrusy body that is quite refreshing, actually. I assumed this beer would have a crisp, spicy palate but what I got was actually quite the opposite. Its very rich with a genuine fruity taste of peach, raisin and just a bit of orange. The description on Chimays website also mentions Muscat (a sweet white grape) and its no lie.The more I drink the more this beer opens up to me. Eventually the yeast makes itself known adding some powdery spice to the palate. I also get a slight banana and clove taste reminiscent of an authentic hefeweizen, but not nearly as strong. It all adds up for a very tasty and very satisfying beer.DRINKABILITYUnlike other tripels Ive tried, the spiciness of Chimay White doesnt overwhelm. This is a beer I can actually drink in gulps rather than confined to sips. The mouthfeel itself is extremely soft, whereas others Ive had were crisp making them a challenge to drink.The only caveat to this beer is its density. Chimay White weighs in at 8% ABV and it does make itself known after one serving (but not until AFTER the serving). There is NO trace of alcohol in the taste or aftertaste, which is all the more impressive considering its high potency. Regardless, I think if drank at the proper pace, Chimay White could be a session beer of sorts. At the very least its a very rewarding after-dinner treat.FINAL THOUGHTSAs of this writing my experience with Trappist beers is still fairly limited. However, I think its safe to say that Chimay White would be an excellent starter beer for the drinker looking for a higher-end beer with true drinkability.

Its definitely musty, but in a better way than the Westmalle tripel.  Finishes dry with apricot, clove, and mango notes.

3246,"2010-01-03",4.3,"Leaving the debate of whether or not to lay down corked Belgian 750ml bottles, of which Chimay quite literally and visually warns against doing on their labels, there is also the debate of when their three different beers are best enjoyed by. The Grand Reserve is truly the most age worthy; gaining fine notes of port and rich vinous qualities the longer she safely rests in her bottle. The Premier and Cinq Cents though are a different story. Chimay themselves advice to enjoy both within a year of their life-time, maybe a little more than a year on the Cinq Cents, a Belgian Tripel, but no more than that. Should I take that as the written gospel and adhere not for fear of some divine retribution? Gospel was written to be challenged and broken when needed, in my not so humble opinion, and I shall explain to you exactly why.


Exiting stage right and entering stage left is my corked 750ml bottle of Chimay Cinq Cents, a Belgian Tripel of heavenly proportions. As I undo her wire cage, I always take mind to keep a finger atop the cork to save myself a rocket launch of spectacularly messy proportions. Cage removed, I free her cork with a pop and gaze lovingly at the sensual mist slowly crawling out of the bottles neck, free at last and ready to please. Now, many have asked me how/where one can find the age on a Chimay bottle and save for the life of me you wont find it anywhere readily noticeable on the bottle. Verily, the bottle date is on the top rim of the cork, an unfortunate placement because more often than not that very important wire cage is covering the date with its cap. Thats ok though; I do enjoy a healthy dosing of surprise in my life which upon closer inspection of this cork is what I received. Fellow friends, family, beer geeks, and Chimay spokespersons, I have before me a 2006 Chimay Cinq Cents and my excitement level just went from giddy to full on beer geek ecstasy. I tell you, I couldnt pour her fast enough into my glass, hands atremble in excited anticipation. Illustrious hazy orange, straw, and gold depths with a splattering of amber sit beautifully under a huge puffy pithy head of the orange variety. She fades in splendid regalia, leaving lace every where she touches. A slow stream of bubbles laze their way to the surface, bursting in joyous abandon. There is a smidgen of dregs resting in the cusp of my glass, and without further ado I fully embrace her nose for all her worth. Spice, yeast, and dough ride atop banana cream while flurries of nutmeg and cinnamon tickle. Whole oranges lay before me, and as I slice into their ripe depths, juices flow and pithy esters mingle. For a playful nip in the finish, white pepper and green pepper, to mismatched cousins that manage to mingle harmonious with each other and the whole of my Cenq Cents nose. I feel like a kid at Christmas morning, hands at the ready to rip into her presents aglow with mystery and delight, and so I do. Drawing deep for the first of many amazing quaffs, green pepper and white pepper tickle and tease the front of my tongue which grins happily under a crunchy interplay of sliced and toasted Italian bread upon. Adding to the dryness of her palate is green grass and fresh bales of hay drying in the warm summer sun. The dryness could be attributed to her age, but it is far from detrimental to her palate. My breath is peppered with coriander and orange pith while an undercurrent of honeycomb sweetness carries her palate from start to finish. Her finish is dry and brittle with cinnamon, nutmeg, and dried flowers. Filling out the meat of her palate are oranges, pith, and bananas with their skins included. Warmth slowly starts to spread her supple fingers through my throat and into my chest, a wonderful counterbalance to the dryness of her palate which is simply divine. Setting pen and paper down, I divulge my full attentions upon this aged masterpiece.


There is no doubt that the 2006 Chimay Cinq Cents was far drier than a fresher bottle, and I am OK with that. I love the rich sweetness of a fresh Cinq Cents, but what age offers to this Trappist beauty is sophistication blessed with the perfect measure of dry earthiness. By all means, sup on a fresh one, but dont be afraid to defy the Chimay dictum and age one for a few years and fall in love all over again as I did.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"
3246,"2010-01-02",3.9,"Vintage 2008. Serving date: 2009-01-23. Served in snifter.

Presentation: 330 ml bottle with freshness date (Best before end of 2010) and recommended serving temperature, glassware and cellaring procedure on the label.

Golden yellow with brownish hues. Rather hazy. A semi-hard pour into my large-bodied snifter creates a big white head that looks creamy and thick. The head settles rather slowly and leaves a nice coat and some lacings.

Citric notes and fruity aromas (mostly bananas I think) in the smell. Some wheat and subtle yeast aromas are here as well.

Citric and banana-like fruit flavors. Yeast and wheat provides a nice grainy and earthy character. The alcohol is present and leaves a little twang, but its unbelievably well-balanced. The big and long finish is a bit dry, slightly alcoholic and has a distinct but gentle bitterness that sits side by side with a pleasant spices and white pepper. The finish is really good on this one, and its semi-dry spicy character seems everlasting.

Rather smooth and creamy considering its medium body and the generous amount of carbonation.

Another great Belgian classic, and all in all a wonderful beer. The aromas are perhaps not overly interesting, but the taste is so well-balanced and complex. As for the alcohol, you definitely notice it, but it fits into the overall character.

Aroma is of grapefruit and coriander. Medium-bodied Belgian tripel with ok, but not really substantial mouth feel. Medium carbonation.

Taste of herbal spices, yeast and, again, coriander - much, much less sweet than the aroma indicated. Sweet and sour finish, spicy herbal after taste. More sessionable than many other Belgian tripels (Grimbergen, for one, comes to mind), agreeably non-sweetish. And no perfume either!

3246,"2009-11-02",4.0,"Once I cracked the beer open, I got a very pungent smell of yeast and sweetness. This was a very misleading start for the beer. In the glass, the beer had a very murky, translucent appearance. It had a golden appearance (it looked just as expensive as it is) with a white-ish head. But, the head was very small signifying a lighter beer (EDIT: I poured a glass a couple days later in a pilsner glass and the head was so big that I only poured 70% of the glass out and the head overflowed). The carbonation is also pretty consistent within the beer but it doesnt form into a head - it just falls up and down within the beer. As for the taste, Chimay White starts off very sharp. It hits you right off the bat with the taste of alcohol and the roasted barley and yeast. It eventually mellows out with the smoothness of the brew but as you swallow it, the bitterness kicks in again, just like most other European beers. This was not nearly as fruity as any of the other Chimay brews but it did have a slight citrus bite. In terms of texture, the beer flowed from bitter, to smooth, to bitter again - a very interesting curve in the palate.","Long Valley, New Jersey, USA","dekeq"

However, the darker color evidences its worth in the aroma, as the beer shows malt first, perhaps Munich or a heavy hand with Aromatic.  A nice melange of yeast-derived esters add some dark fruits to that mix.  The palate is malty up front, tasting almost of a Vienna lager.  Malt carries through the mid- and late palate, complimented by a nice hop balance, and supporting fruity (but not over-the-top) yeast notes.  The finish is neutral to slightly sweet, but certainly not cloying.  As I work through the glass, I am greeted by a pleasant warmth that is welcomed, even on a warm day.

On tap at The Sugarbowl bitches! God damn deep fried anchovy stuffed olives fucking rule. 3 orders in and my sodium intake is at 700%. Another great pour with a large fluffy white head that leaves stupid lacing. The aroma is a little hard to place but Ive picked up some things: the orange candy with spices is stellar, so refreshing that it seems to open up my nasal passage. Its a warm orange - similar to soccer slices in a plastic bag at half time. This beer excels to a level that surprised me big time as the flavours are so in my face. The yeast is fairly prominent but not overpowering even if it is leading feature here. Spicy orange candy followed by plenty of yeasty lingerings. So good. Incredible on tap.

Review from summer 08
Yay! Aged Chimay! Poured out a very nice amber / orange brew with a large, thick off white puffy cap, 360 degrees of lacing throughout and a huge amount of sediment. Slightly sour nose, huge yeast that is very prominent. Man, this has massive aroma. Slightly musty, some citurs (ripe pinapple), mid to mid range spices, a touch of smoke??? (huh?) - a very fresh smelling beer indeed. Pretty tasty too. No alcohol to be found, nice medium spicy yeast, soft mild pepper, noticable malts when warmer. Not a thick tasting beer thats for sure. I just dumped in all the sediment and, as expected, there was a big increase in the potentcy of the spices. Lots of smooth carbonation, medium light bodied. Has a nice yeasty, spicy blend in the after taste to go along with a hard bitter finish that is not overpowering. A very tasty, mouth watering beer. 
*****
Edmonton swillfest in my basement with the usual dolts - very excited to get a hold of another bottle of the white (it had been about 3 years). Impressive solid fluffy head perched on top a light orangish brew. A little weak on the aroma - floral (although this may have been beercronicsheros perfume) and quite yeasty - a little dissapointing. First flavour to hit my mouth was some soft yeast which seemed to stronger followed by a suprising bitterness, more than I expected and some sour undertones. Bitterness was quite spicy too (tis a good thing!)and I never really noticed the 8%. Interesting taste that Im not sure I liked. Finished empty. Quite dissapointing - maybe not the beer to sample following Rochefort 10, but when you expect a beer to be unreal, you can get unreal results. Need another bottle to re-sample.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

Bottle brown, 330 ml
Appearance: Pours bright amber, honey like, sunny, orangy - reddish body, carbonation is natural and rather weak, body is very muddy due to a high yeast sediment resulting from long aging, head is off - white, slightly beige and whipped cream like in colour, deep, dense, compact, initially medium and slowly decreasing to small, there is a quite nice lacing.
Aroma: Very nice bitterness and dryness coming from the background, at front there is a gentle, milky, creamy, soft, silky, crispy aroma of malt, white bread, dough and gentle touch of cookies, yeasts and kind of tart wood, probably from aging, notes of raisin, muscat, orange, orange peal, champaigne, white wine grapes, coriander, perfumy touch of spices, quite assertive.
Flavour: Very strong and essential taste from the very beginning like in the example of Chimay Rouge, very strong and bitter hops which together with astringent spices contribute to the dry character of the beer, solid grainy base with notes of wheat and barley, dryness is balanced by smooth yeast contributing to the mellow texture. Nice alcoholic warmth in the aftertaste, alcohol doesnt spoil the taste. Champaigne, white wine grapes, raisin, coriander, lemon, orange peal, earthy touches, dough and cookies, corn, long and pleasant finish. The great representative of its style.
Palate: Body is full, texture is dry, carbonation on palate is weak, finish feel is highly astringent, moderately alcoholic despite its 8%, very clean, aromatic hoppy, spicy.","Zawiercie/Sosnowiec, POLAND","sirPino"

3246,"2009-03-31",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2012 
Location: 12 oz bottle, 8/6/12


Aroma: The aroma is full of Belgian yeast and spice, with notes of fruit and caramel

Appearance: It pours a dark golden color with a large frothy foam of off-white head and heavy lace

Flavor: The taste is mid-plus sweet and mid-plus spicy, similar to the nose component-wise

Palate: The body is medium-plus, it has a tingly mouthfeel to it, and it drinks nicely with a dry finish

Overall Impression: 
This one definitely needed a re-rate, as I was lacking quite a bit in the details.  Anyway, this one is a classic.  I dont drink it that often, mostly due to the regular price point, but it is still a really good beer that I always enjoy when I drink one.  I think the score is about right, so Im going to leave it where it is.

Location: 750 from Rodmans, October 08


Overall Impression: 
Nice, enjoyable tripel, not the absolute top of its style, but its a great style. Old Score: 8/4/8/3/15","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

RE-RATE 3/28/11 Bottle from World Market.  I poured this beer very slowly, so as to leave the yeast sediment in the bottom of the bottle.   I am actually cultivating this yeast for a homebrew beer I am planning on doing later this week.  Even pouring it slowly, the beer still develops a nice frothy white head.  The color starts at a light orange yellow near the stem of the glass and gradually grows to a darker amber color as it nears the head.  Lots of suspended sediment can be seen in this as well.  That is to be expected however.

The aroma is fairly yeasty, with lots of banana and clove esters.  Very much a Belgian fruit aroma.  Sweet notes and fruit are the main things that I can smell for sure.

The flavor is fruity, like sugary fruit snacks that tingle the tongue.  The alcohol levels can certainly be felt through the tingles and its overall mouthfeel.  Flavorful and tasty, this starts off well and has a slightly bitter/fruity-dry finish.  Lots of other spicy notes in this, like clove and zesty flavors.  Very nice and better than I remembered.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"

Appearance: It has a slightly hazy, peachy golden colored body with a thick, heavenly, white and foamy head. It is supported by an active carbonation and it very slowly recedes to a much thinner creamy layer of foam that leaves behind sticky white lacing.

Smell: The aroma has delicate fruity character with dry yeast notes and a just a hint of medicinal phenols and hops in the distance.

Taste/Mouth feel: The flavor has mellow fruity notes of Muscat, golden raison and apple mixing with pale malted grain and dry earthy yeast. Hop flavor is mild but adds a mild slash of herbal spice and mellow bitterness. Its 8%abv is well hidden but adds to the overall complexity and smooth rounded mouth feel. It finishes with some light phenol flavors and mild spicy hops fading off the tongue.

I struggled to pin down what bugged me about it.  By contrast, both the St. Bernardus and the Westmalle seemed to be ""continuous"" and ""integrated"", with all the elements holding together:  In Westmalle the ester profile gives way naturally to the alcohol then malt, then hop bitterness and dryness---each element seems to anticipate the next.  In Chimay white though, I get the chimay yeast banana ester profile, then CLUNK the malt, then CLUNK the hop bitterness.  St. Bernardus Tripel fell between the Chimay and the Westmalle, being more like  the Chimay in flavors and aromas, but with better integration.",", California, USA","Simcoe"

Instead, this beer has a much more full body, a cloudy, deep golden head with a nice and lasting beige head, and a really fruity, yet balanced aroma and flavor.  There is a distinct citrus presence in the flavor as well as sweet, fruity malt and yeastiness in the front, some light spice, bread, and dry grape-like quality in the middle, and then just enough hoppy flavor and bitterness in the finish to balance everything out and add some complexity.  The strength of the alcohol is lost in all of the other wonderful flavors.   This is a great beer that really exceeded my expectations.

Lots of herbs (coriander of course), and oranges and lemons abound. Extremely fizzy; dancing on the tongue like raindrops bouncing off tarmac.

This is a kind of beer that gets better after you’ve already supped a few.  There was a trace of freshly mown grass.  Quite sharp on the finish and the alcohol gets more intense as you reach the bottom of the glass. A smattering of banana?

It coats the inside of my mouth and leaves a nice lingering bitterness.  Let this one warm a bit and its great.UPDATE:  I finally got some real Chimay glasses and had some of this beer on hand.  I have to say that the proper glassware made a great difference in an already great beer.  The etching in the bottom keeps that fine head throughout the short life of the glass and the open top really brings out the brighter flavors in the aroma.

The aroma is surprisingly hoppy with a underlying sweet malt and hints of fruit. The aromas are precursors to the flavor palette. A complex blend of hoppy, fruity and yeasty. There are a range of spices lingering in there as well; pepper, cinnamon are noted. A faint candy sweetness waits in the background.

There is also some malt present. The taste is very spicy and has a solid alcohol backing. Very hoppy as well. The taste is like a white beer that has been very generously dosed with hops.

Aroma of pepper, grass, hay, coriander (even if its not actually in this brew), a little doughy malt and just a little pleasant alcohol heat.  Smooth flavor is a bit more caramelly at first, with some grapes(chardonnay-like)  to follow.  Some wheat and grass flavors occur, followed by bitter pepper and spice.  Finishes with a slight bit of doughy malt and that grassy bitter pepper flavor.  Some sort of sweetish earthy flavor in there too, but the aftertaste is rather pepper.

3246,"2007-09-27",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2007 Bottle conditioned and courtesy of the LCBO. Drank before after the Chimay Rouge so I could compare these two styles from the monastery. Pours a burnished gold with an effervescent white head, which diminishes to leave moderate lacing. Smells of fruit and spice, but lighter than the rouge. Initial mouthfeel is very pleasant and reminded me of raisins and grapefruit. Bitterness kicks in as the liquid hits the back of the mouth, and I imagine this would be a good accompaniment to rich foods, as it would clean the palate of any fats. Its tough to pick between the white and the red, as they are both well-made and complex beers, but my personal preference leans towards the spicier taste of the red.

It is interesting to not the yeast differences which translate to subtle taste differences, though pretty straight-forward.  also, as the ale warms, the flavor profile changes; the sweetness increases, but so does the hop presence.

3246,"2007-09-05",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2010 33cl bottle from systembolaget in Lund.   Pours a murky golden amber with a lasting white head that leaves good lacing.   Aroma of banana, caramel, and cinamon, with a pronounced yeasty doughiness.   Flavor is much of the same, but with a cloying sweetness that takes over and runs with the flavor.  Theres some hop presence, but overall not enough to balance the sweetness out.   Body is thick and smooth, with lively carbonation.   This is a decent brew, but my least favorite of the Chimays.   Red is smoother, and blue is more complex.   This is my first tripel, so maybe Ill give it another shot. 

Rerate:   Draught at The Red.   My tastes have definitely changes since first sampling this back in Lund.   Nice tropical fruit and spice in the nose.   Definitely not cloying like I thought back then, but not dry for the style.   Probably my favorite of the three now.(8,4,7,4,15=38)

Cloudy gold-orange with a medium-large white head that leaves some lasting foam and light lace in my Duvel Green tulip.   My first impression is of the mouthfeel--it is quite chalky and dry.   Bitterness seems to stand out, as well as alcohol.   The aroma is quite yeasty with some banana and orange peel, along with some herbal and spicy hops.   The flavor is lightly sweet up front and then herbal and quite bitter in the finish.   Dry and chalky in the end, with a touch of alcohol.   Its pretty funny to look back on my original review and see that my complaint about the beer was that it was sweet, though maybe it was much fresher in europe than over here. Definitely not as clean feeling as the draught version.   (7,4,7,3,14=3.5)","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

Sams Downers Grove

Chimays tripel pours a murky, hazy orange that turns more golden when held to the light. Some sediment but its very small and just makes for a hazy body. 1+ finger white creamy head that recedes to a half finger and leaves lacing on its way down. Thick drink lines after each sip.

Smell is quite fruity with peach being the main component along with pear and green apple. A doughy rye bread maltiness struts around in the background. Yeasty spiciness swirls around and is subtle at times while standing out at other times. Theres a darker somewhat heavy sugar quality along with wildflower petals.

Flavors transition seamlessly up front. Peach and pear start things off along with a helping of candi sugar. Even some creamy banana. Doughy malts and a mix of spicy alcohol and a spiciness from the yeast show up mid palate. The spiciness follows through to the finish where it meets up with a slightly sticky sweetness. Dusty yeast character on the swallow.

Medium body with a creamy texture as it hits the tongue. A little too sticky for a tripel, for my liking anyways. 

Easy drinking tripel. My glass is disappearing pretty quick. Good fruity flavors make for an enjoyable sipper.

A solid tripel from one of the few remaining Trappist Breweries. An enjoyable treat when in the mood for a slightly heavier bodied tripel.

Also, contrary to the commercial description, I found that the smell was slightly acidic, but that didnt really matter to me. The taste carried sweet fruits at first: peaches, nectarines, and raisins, if I were to put a name to the flavors. The finish was slightly bready and bitter, and all of this was surrounded by a general spiciness and mild/moderate banana tones. I liked it all very much. It was pleasant, dynamic, and refreshing.

Coriander and nutmeg. Fruity (banana). Bitter finish. (More coriander showing up). Third rerate: A great example of a tripel in my opinion. But quite heavy on the clove component... Good bitterness.

Nose is quite nice with dominant floral notes, lots of yeast and esters; smaller notes of herbs, orange citrus, and subtle spicing.  Flavor is more potent and more bitter than I would have thought; starts with sweet candi sugar and orange with yeast, but a bitterness just over medium takes over with floral and herbal notes leading to the finish.  Palate is medium, lively, a tad dry with a silky, not quite creamy, feel.  Finishes mostly bitter with minimal candi sugar and quite a bit of earthy herbs (maybe thyme) with a moderate dryness.  Quite nice tripel and more bitterness than most, but overall, the floral and herbal notes are nice and add a strange character.  Something different and refreshing, as far as light Belgians go, but that is expected from Chimay.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a cloudy, dark amber with an average-sized, white head. The aroma was light to moderate herb hops and light to moderate yeast, some white wine and light fruits. The initial flavor was light sweetness and moderate bitterness, whilt the finish was modeately sweet with an average to long duration.

3246,"2007-02-20",3.1,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2008  I had this at the Sharp Edge Creek House in Pittsburgh, thanks to mtoast.  Pour is a golden yellow, like any other ubiquitous American pale yellow beer. For the aroma, I think I detect a hint of fruity sweetness in the brew but it is not like the sickening sweetness of so many other trippels Ive tasted, very mild and laid back. Other than that it is the smell of your typical yeasty beer. I am surprised at the aroma and the look, I guess I was expecting something really different. It masquerades as a typical beer before you taste it. This has a nice white head that stays and keeps going, it does not fade. The first taste impression is very interesting; never had anything like this before. It has a unique personality of a well behaved gentleman. You can barely taste the alky, this is so much better than any other trippel I have had.  Perhaps Grimbergen Blonde is close to this but this Chimay is just plain likeable. The alky is so well hidden, other less refined trippels are in your face.  This is miles above Southern Tier Trippel, Golden Monkey and Weyers Merry Monks.  There is a little hoppy bitterness in there but I almost refuse to call it bitterness, it is so well controlled that the positive hoppy flavors remain while the bitterness seems to be extracted some how.  I think I am now getting the feel of what makes good beer good. The flavor also has a bit of unexpected staleness or mustiness to it but it is not in a negative manner, if that is possible.  It only contributes to the complexities of this brew. Finish is not offensive in the least bit. It lacks the nasty alky linger that is so common with all those big beer styles. This is a very refined trippel. Now I know what a good trippel should be like; pleasant, enjoyable and repeatable. All those other trippels now seem harsh compared to this. Im moving on, not looking back!","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

There was a definate complex taste, with a sort of fruitiness that I could not immediately identify (they say it is muscat, but I have no clue what that is). Complexity is defined by the three (maybe more) stages of taste. The   first taste, is different than the second, then the third has a definate dry bite, but it is not of alcohol, slightly hoppy i suppose.

Pour produced the signature hazed orange ale with the killer cap that stacks out of my new Chimay chalice...Moderate effervescence.

Very pleasing nose...all the spices and fruit and phenols are there...very complex...I will attempt to simplify by simply saying it has the aroma of a poached apricot ( flambeau) in candied-spiced brandy.

The aging went well on this bottle...the fusil and phenol tastes of a young bottle were subdued and the fully blended flavors came forward with a relaxed smoothness and mellow character. 

Up front there was a lot of thick sweet malt which was balanced off with the fruit-herbs and spice tones leaving an impression of frozen cinnamon bun dough with tangerine slices, mid palate these flavors evolve into a more complex taste senasation which is more spice pronounced then the long finish where gradual drying takes place and the phenominal hop mixture shows up to complicate the end of this drink by peppering it with metallic-fruity-medicinal-herbal tastes which fight against the near cloying malts and sugars...everything in balance on this drink...very pleasurable to sip on...particualrly on this damp chilly evening...thanks Rob...wonderful birthday gift...thanks.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"

Very good, as its reputation declares, but this is probably my least favourite of the 3 Chimay offerings. Its quite hoppy for an Abbey beer and perhaps that took me by surprise. Not as robust as I think I want it to be, and a little bit thin in flavour. The finish is, as others have mentioned, long and dry.

Flavor is the same with a little bit of candy sugar added.  Dry bitter finish.  With the exception of La Chouffes Houblon, this is the hoppiest tripel Ive had.  A little bit of warming ETOH noted.  Highly carbonated, a little lighter bodied than I had expected.  This was a little bit of a letdown for me.  I think that some of the reason for my low score is for the lack of complexity.

3246,"2006-08-31",3.3,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2007 Last year Chimay marketed a bundle in the United States that included the Chimay Red, White, Blue and a Chimay glass.  Feeling generous (and at the same time, greedy) I bought the collection as a self-addressed Christmas gift.  I had had the Blue once before and greatly enjoyed it, even if it was startlingly new, but now I had the Chimay triumvirate sitting around  for a long time.  For months my Chimay glass never held its own claim to grace, bearing the beer of foreign brewers rather than its native Chimays.  Only now have those three bottles insisted on being given a chance.  I decided the first to oblige was the Abbey Tripel.  Like the others it came in an unassuming, chromatically eponymous bottle that alluded to something lighter.  The Chimay Blue was a pretty astounding beer, but I had no hint or indication that the quality of one of their beers would carry to its others.  Just a month before, I had received two phone messages of a friend of mine recently gotten into Belgians.  Garrett, this is K, look theyre serving the white SHEE-MAY at this restaurant.  Thats the good stuff right?  Ohmigawd, this is awesome, its on TAP!  Second message: K againwow, that was really disappointing.  Didnt taste anything like I expected.  IwellI justwell talk later.  I dont usually invest much in his beer-oriented opinions (see ramblings), but the messages left some doubt.  Pushing my mercurial friends review aside I poured the beer and took it to task.  It poured a nice, deep and earth tone rich color and sat in the glass thick and viscous looking like clover honey.  The thin and wane cream colored head bobbed flimsily above the denser liquid below, from which a simple but pleasant scent or orange, hops, wheat, flowers and pine resin wafted.  There was a noticeable difference between the aroma and flavors, however.  Most of the sweeter and more playful tastes are absent.  Instead the Chimay White relies on a balanced blend of malt and bland hops, buzzing with centered flavors and ending high and dry.  Other tripels have been sweeter, most memorably like New Belgiums.  Now I cant figure out whether NBs candy Tripel or Chimays sophisticated version is the exception, and which one is the rule.  This tasting merits more samplings in the style to characterize the full breadth of tripels.  While not a bad beer at all, it tastes like its lacking some sui generis quality that would make its class stand out amongst others.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
3246,"2006-08-31",3.9,"Pours golden with a thin foamy beige head.

3246,"2006-08-29",3.6,"333 ml bottle in big Italian Wine glass - BB 2009. Pours a deep frothy white head that stays forever. Pale amber. Geyser-like carbonation with dust-devel like yeast swirls. Looks great. Nose is of ripe peaches and pears backed by earthy yeast notes. The beers crispness hits up front coupled with a big rush of alcohol warmth on the initial swallow - definitive of an Abbey beer brewed with candy sugar. Mid presentation is malty sweet with a hint or caramel but ends dry and very clean with a hint of oranges in the final swallow. An exellent beer but I think a bit overstated in use of candisugar vs real malt. I would like to see more body in the beer to carry the complex flavour profile. I think the dark version, Chimay Blue is a better balanced beer.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","brewgirlca"

Its body is a murky amber-orange, which carries a fine, off-white frothy head.  If you put your nose to it, you may smell a moderate hoppiness combined with a light yeastiness and overtones of apple and alcohol.  As you begin to taste it, you will likely find it lightly sweet and acidic.  This initial tagteam becomes more powerful toward the finish, which is average - long.

Huge amounts of pils malt with Belgian candi sugar, light citrus, dusty golden raisins, honey, apricots, flowers, and spicey pepper.
Taste is of the same aromas with a bit of bitter hops that comes across as bitter lemon rind, & orange peel with a touch of coriander...American hops in there?
Medium bodied brew with a mild dustiness touching upon sweetness, and bitterness. Its sort of like mixing some white sugar with some watered down honey and throwing in some dandelions with a shake of pepper. Now shake it all up in a dusty mug and swallow.

Aroma / Appearance - Rich bitter chocolate, bread yeast, a hint of fruitiness and some barnyard tones.  The body is a deep walnut brown with a one-finger head that foams then dies.

Flavor / Palate - Buttery coca, subtle hop esthers and a low-key bitterness precede the main flavors of creamy caramel and sweetness.  The alcohol is distinct but not overpowering.  Every sip grasps the corners of my mouth and refuses to let go for minutes.  This was extremly easy to drink with a dry, creamy finish.

Yeasty aromas of lemon and spice are accompanied by a nice bouquet of fresh pineapple and white grape skins.

Aroma is wheat and a hoppy citrus with a distinct citrus scent.  Initial flavor is nutty and sweetly peppery, then transitions right into fruity citrus flavors including green apple, raisin, and an array of other subtle dark fruits.  Underlying honey and understated port round things out.  Finished long with fruit (mostly raisin and green apple) and a mild bitterness.

Strong Tripel aroma with a fruity character that presents light notes of caramel and brown sugar and hints of honey, vanilla, peaches, apricots, pears and even some spicy touches. The hops give it some resin and pine notes. Well-disguised alcohol. The flavor is well rounded and complex as the smell. It starts sweet and powerful, ending with a nice soft bittersweet and alcoholic combination with some bread, that leaves a great aftertaste. Strong for a tripel, almost full bodied, it is however incredibly smooth and has a syrupy texture. The carbonation is soft and doesnt detracts from the flavors. The end is moderately alcoholic.

Initial aroma is very yeasty and fruity, like a hefeweizen. Yup, yeast and wheat dominate the aroma, with maybe just a hint of pear and even less of white grape. Taste hits you with the malt up front. The overall flavor is really dominated by it, but some of the pear and yeast come through as well. There are some other super subtitle notes, perhaps floral, but Im just not able to pinpoint them right now. Mouth feel is pretty great; milk consistency and smooth, the ever present head makes it feel even more luxurious than it would otherwise. Warms the chest quite a bit. Finishes with wheat, floral hoppiness, a tad of apple peel, and alcohol. Well, its a Chimay. You get a really freakin good beer. Just isnt a revolutionary really freakin good beer.

Spicy, floral ambitions in the aroma with some stark lemon rind, buttercream, shortbread, pepper, starch and coriander to boot.  Whole wheat bread flavor toys with baguettes.  Biscuity mouth feel progresses alongside detectable alcohol, all in cahoots with a curt barnyard (bordering) funk composure.  Sharp palate sting, then a yeasty recession.  An elemental understanding of the harsh reality of how to hop a Trappist tripel to spicy bitterness.  Forceful, delectable palate battle that simultaneously stays creamy and clean.  Spicy hops and a dirty little yeast strain lead to a finish capsulated by peppered grain and herbal buttered sourdough.  A good benchmark for the style.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

[Oct 3, 2007] 

Had this on tap again. Pretty good stuff. It lacks a bit of the cohesiveness or depth of a few outstanding tripels, but this is a pleasing quaff any time.

 Sampled in a blind tasting. This was the darkest of the four tripels, though crystalline, with a very tall white head. The nose on this was flat and muted by comparison. It was slightly metallic and acrid with less yeast character. The flavor redeems the beer with hints of sweet rolls, honey, and mild spices. The level of esteriness is fair. This is a good beer, but definitely was lacking next to the competition.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

It even has a hint of a chemical odour that is at least mildly off-putting. Thought the taste and mouthfeel might redeem aforementioned wrongs... nope. Hints at fruits but gives way almost instantly to persistant bitterness. The drink is coarse. Overall, a big let down in the world of Trappists.

Poured a medium sized creamy and thick white head that never fully went away, beautiful misty orange (standard tripel) colour, with lovely streams of carbonation near the top. The nose was an assault of coriander and ""orange juice"". Tastewise, it didnt impress me. I never felt that it was the best tripel Ive had (close though). Grapeseed bitterness is the main taste here, and its mixed with pronounced spiciness. Interesting two-front assault, but it perhaps needs a more pronounced malty background to prove to me its ""classic"" status. It felt too harsh, and overhopped.

3246,"2005-07-03",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 21, 2005 Quite surprised by this one, wouldnt go out of my way to call it a Tripel, it seemed too unique for any classification. Held one in the cellar for a year or so, and poured it (12-14 degrees) into a stumpy tulip glass. A big dense two layered whitish head formed from the pour, atop a hazy peach body, with a lot of fine yeast that remained captured in suspension. Sweet toffee, lemon and orange peel nose with a balance of vanilla and drying herbal and floral hops. Aroma followed each mouthful well. Smooth, yet high in carbonation (not biting), very fruity and yeasty. Lightly spiced, husky and mellowing; light fruity smooth swallow, long and a little warming. Beautifully balanced and well rounded in its sweetish flavours throughout, smooth and very dry in the mouth (driest of the chimays) it, honestly, deserves another sip, more complex than my notes, this was a lovely beer that shouldnt be labelled a tripel.

Strong spice aroma, some alcohol present as well.  Strong sharp citrus taste.  Thin to medium mouthfeel.  Strong alcohol in taste, especially as it warms.  It  doesnt look it, but this feels very carbonated - almost too much, detracts from the flavour.  Flavour is certainly more one dimensional than the Blue.

Definantly a world classic beer.  A fine example of what yeast can do.  Absolutley spectacular color in the goblet, thick frothy head that will not budge unless the sweet nectar below it is sipped.  A complex plateau of what must be sterling hops and exotic citrus and asian spices. Very clean malt balance and crisp refreshing finish that pleads with the drinker to have another sip.

From there it goes downhill though, appearance is orangey with a gassy head. I didnt really taste much complexity or interest at all in this one, just an overly carbonated mouthful and pleasantly bitter hops with a sweet aftertaste.

Flavor is less complex than my other experiences with the style.  This one comes across as sweet, has the requisite full body and very strong malty flavor, as well as a nice bitterness, but the alcohol wears out its welcome in the flavor.  It covers up so much, that Im missing much of the spice and fruit that I expect in this style. I catch a little banana and clove right at the end, but thats all.   While it may in fact be a Tripple, its missing most of the best things about the style.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","sethdude"

Nose is spicey and spritzy - you can feel the carbonation in your nostrils!  Some hints of breadiness.  
Flavour is peppery sweet, slightly winey and definitely yeasty; and is delivered in a light but soft mouthfeel that carries millions of tight tiny bubbles.

It is leaner cleaner and more interstingly complex than either and has a fabulous refreshing mouthful of hops!  This is the first beer I have rated here.  I’ve given it the maximum rating in every department because over many years of trying and comparing hundreds of beers, this is my absolute favourite and has been so for a long time...Duvel is similar in some ways and is second in my personal ratings, but does not have the almost miraculous WOW factor of the white-cap Chimay.","ENGLAND","cmalc"

Possibly best showing for me. Bitter orange rind, abusers, candy fruit late. Serious beer and cant always accuse a triple of that trait.
Bottled: 2007
Tasted: January 2009 (13/20)
I havent had a great track record cellaring triples and this is no exception. Looks fantastic; massive billowing head, pure white, and a nice apricot coloured body. Chunky lacing too. Nose shows mild malt sweetness, some spice and a touch of aniseed. All very faint. Palate is dominated by fizz and light, but dirty, sweet malt character. Finishes surprisingly dry with a mild aniseed edge. Not much to advocate further cellaring, let alone hanging onto it for as long as I did.
Vintage: 2004
Consumed: Feb 2005
Good head, spongy, thick.  Cloudy burnt orange in the glass - nice. Subtle nose, some clove and spcie but not overt. Palate weight is a surprise given the nose; more spice, alcohol sweetness, some heat, big mouthfeel and drive.  Does get progressively lighter through the palate.  I felt it also had some ale characters hanging around the side which added to the complexity.","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"

Initial palate is slightly sweet, fruity and characteristic of white grape raisin, orange rind and spice.  The finish is tart with light hop bitterness and hint of alcohol.

Appearance; thickly opaque dark orange hue, with a full-flowering head of foam that dwindles and disappears almost immediately.
Aroma: sharp citrus, yeast, sour, must, ...thats it...
Taste: rather blase, little going on with the flavor, nothing to busy the palate.
Malt, yeast, thick citric, orangey feel, but little else, small, if any, hops, and fading flavor. Too sharp, too spicy, with little in the body and texture to balance that out. Feels drab, really, leaden, cardboard-y, actually. I dont re-visit this ale too often, so my memory is fuzzy whether this is supposed to taste so dreary.
Over halfway in, the fruitiness is broader, with more flavors swimming about, juicy, tropical fruits,pineapple, sweet, spicy, kicky...a far cry from the best tripels of Belgium. I may actually look into it, again, to investigate whether this sampling was inferior, and perhaps the brew was meant to taste much more amazingly. Until then...Chimays is an underwhelming tripel experience.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

A versatile beer, it can take the place of chardonay with a spicey or fishy dish.  In fact, some wine notes carry over from nose to flavor.  Hops are, as advertised, nicely intertwined with the yeasts, but this beer might just be too hoppy for its own good...its only downfall, IMO.  The beer is so fresh tasting, so grassy, peppery, floral, fruity; the finishing betterness adds to the fresh effect.

Initially slightly sweet taste (honey & water) is followed by flavors of spice, wood, and cowfield.

3246,"2004-01-14",2.9,"UPDATED: AUG 24, 2015 Bottled (330ml). Colour is attractive deep gold underscored by a suggestion of orange. It has a moderate fluffy head, which quickly subsides. The aroma is dominated by yeast and Demerara sugar, with an undercurrent of wheat and malt. Spritzy on the tongue, but relatively light bodied. The flavour is dominated by lemons with some underlying sweetness, but the two aspects are not especially well integrated  imagine adding sugar to neat lemon juice. Well hopped, but the hops announce their presence a tad aggressively and without subtlety. There is sharpness on the finish that lingers and tends towards astringency. I certainly wouldnt say that the after-bitterness melts in the mouth as claimed. This beer is crisp and quaffable for a Trappist, but somewhat straightforward and uncomplicated. None of this is to say that I actively dislike the beer; I just cant really see what everyone raves about.

3246,"2003-10-28",3.6,"UPDATED: AUG 12, 2007 Creamy, bright beige head over a deep bright amber liquid. Quite nice really!

Wintery, fruity aroma that had me thinking about vanilla icecream with almonds! Maybe Im losing it...

First impression is somewhat overpowering. Noticable alcohol and the beer feels big in the mouth at first and complex. A hint of sweetness can be found, but mostly its a pretty dry, spicy beer that leaves a nice bitter finish. A nice one!

Revisited 12th of August, 2007: Interesting how I still think some of my description is spot on but other things make me wonder. I thought this was a complex beer? Obviously I wasnt completely weened of Stella.

The aroma doesnt strike me as wintery, but I notice sweet and spicy orange. Perhaps thats coriander Im picking up?

In fact I think its more the flavour thats wintery. Theres a certain flatness in there that reminds me of a lot of Hefeweisses. Citrusy sting, perhaps grapefruit, along with alcohol and there might be a bit of pepper to the aftertaste along with... some greens that linger?

Anyway, it laces nicely, has strings of carbonation and is quite enjoyable. Im going to shave OA down from 15 to 14. Its nice but Im not quite as easily impressed four years on.","Falun, SWEDEN","Kalli"

This has a nice semi-dry taste to it..you can taste the alcohol..its pretty spicy.

3246,"2003-10-19",3.9,"Decent head from the pour which is nice and frothy on top.  Huge carbonation.  Aroma is mainly yeast with a touch of citrus.  Color is a medium orange/amber and is slightly hazy.  Flavor is full but not that complex.  More yeast and citrus with some spices added.  The finish is the best part of this beer in my opinion.  Nice and smooth with a slight hops bitterness and a nice alcohol warming.  Very easy drinking, which could get you into trouble.  A good quality triple.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"

It's well carbonated with a bitter touch on the end, but the flavor doesn't live up to the nose.  I could probably use one more year of aging to round off the edges.  Tasty none the less.

Highly carbonated, because the cork nearly shot out of the bottle as I opened it. Poured a cloudy orange color, with major chill haze.
Frothy white head never did subside. I had to spoon it out just so I could smell it. Peppery aroma right off the bat. Typical funky Belgian yeast smell to it as well. Kind of horsey actually. Not quite as bad as a lambic, but not far off, either. Not much in the hops department. Aroma or taste wise. Malt & lactic wheat tastes to this (apparently) popular Belgian. Thin mouthfeel, highly carbonated, almost too much so. Has a phenolic character to it as well. Not my favorite Belgian, but then again, not too awful bad.","","Cobra"
3246,"2003-09-05",4.1,"75 cL bottle, goblet, 10/01 bottling, 57 degrees.  Gigantic, fizzy, frothy, white head lasts well and leaves great lacing.  Body is an amber-orange and is hazy from a dense collection of tiny and small particles.  Light toasted light bread and toasted grain malt aroma; medium flowery, sprucey, citric (lime) hop aroma; light cobweb yeast aroma; light white grapes, rome apples, clove and alcohol aromas.  The aroma is much lighter than I was expecting.  I am immediately stunned by how smooth this is for a hoppier beer and how well the dryness builds from start to aftertaste.  Impressive.  Moderately sweet, lightly bitter flavor becomes a lightly sweet, moderately bitter finish.  Absolutely no acidity.  The aftertaste grows more dry as the malt falls away from the hops.  Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation.  For me, this one is more about the mouthfeel than the taste.  The flavor is quite simple compared to the aroma.  The bottom line is: excellent looking and a great example of how a ""lighter"" beer can have great mouthfeel.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

3246,"2003-08-29",4.3,"It was Valentines Day, the day for all lovers to show their true feelings. My wife was having her favorite wine with dinner. I was having dinner with my mistressa good beer. I chose a bottle of Chimay White for my evening, I had enjoyed the Chimay Red and wanted to try something different but something I was reasonably sure would be good.

After opening the bottle, which is pretty fun actually (uncorking a bottle of beer is something you dont do everyday in the states), I poured the nectar into my glass. It poured a cloudy light amber, bordering on orange. The head was ample, but descended in a short couple of minutes.

For a beer with an 8% alcohol content, I was surprised that the aroma was so subdued. I was also struck by a subtle citrus smell.

At first taste, I noticed a sweet, fruity flavor that was as subtle as the aroma. The aftertaste was short-lasting. There really is no overpowering flavor here, a combination of fruit, malt and a creamy spiciness that made for a very satisfying mouthfeel. 

This is a superb beer. I imagine it would be excellent either at the dinner table or the bar. It is one of the most satisfying ales I have ever had, because of its subtle combination of flavors and its smooth drinkability. A world class beer.","Addison, Texas, USA","kindestcut"

You MUST DRINK THIS at the right temperature (56-57ish) or the flavor will not come out and you will not get the true experience.  Just tried this in the small bottle. WOW! This is the best tripel Ive had to date(RERATE.  Ive tried alot more tripels, this is still good, but not as good as some of the best ones).  It didnt suffer from the overly yeasty/grainy flavor I see in so many belgians.  Had a great floral flavor at points and I even thought I tasted some citrus notes.  The alcohol was not reserved for the finish and was pleasantly present throughout and adds to a huge yeasty/raisiny complex body.  While I was drinking this, I kept thinking of an abbey pale and even an american pale.  It had a wonderfully even body which I did not find myself wanting more of at the end, which is usually the case with most beers.  This is one of the better beers Ive tried in fact and many brewers could learn a lesson from this.  Only things detracting from this beer is its need of a little extra kick of something in the main body, though I should reiterate, it does have a wonderful medium- full body. I have looked, and I do not taste any metallic bitterness on the finish.  Rerate, it dosent have nearly as much flavor as many smaller brewed belgians and is a bit astringent.  This one is much more on the drier side, could stand more malt/bubble gum.  Good sharp lemon/hops/citrus mix on the aroma.Draught tulip at redbones, January 2006Fairly aggressive yeastiness, plenty of perfumey alcohol esters and lots of dry, grainy biscuity malt.  Dry fruits on the end, but could use something to anchor it, ie. more malt and body.  Seemed a little too aerated and bubbly, with too much sharpness.  Not quite as much finesse or sheer flavor as some of the best in the class, but I need to get a 750mL bottle and sit down and give it a better review.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

It also has a very mild aroma that is hard to notice. It reminded me of nothing in particular. The carbonation rolled off my tongue yet the taste was mostly of that carbonation with a mild fore and after taste. I liked the taste though. This is a beer I could get drunk on.

Nose is lovely.  Often the nose of a beer improves as it warms and the nose here was immediately pronounced, sweet and enticing.  Flavor, especially when compared with the nose, is unexpectedly dry, perhaps a bit too heavy on the carbonation, and lightly bitter.  After such a sweet nose, this is very surprising.

I dont like this quite as much as I do the Premiere or the Reserve, probably due to the less intensive maltiness I love so much in Belgian ales. As well complimented as the bitterness is, I think the esters and fruit are a bit lost in the flavor. This doesnt quite sit on the palate like a nice fluffy Belgian should (in my opinion that is).

3246,"2002-07-17",3.9,"750ml bottle dated 03/00. Hazy peach. Tons of sediment. Fat and frothy white head. Turbulent carbonation. Healthy aroma doused with yeast, spicy notes and sugary hints. Wisps of sour acidity. Surprisingly mellow, despite the carbonation. Slightly airy but tolerable. Spicy and zesty with a nice hop charge. Lingering yeast aftertaste. Medium body. Musty and damp with traces of sweetness. The spiciness is playful and tempers the yeast flavor a bit, at times. Mushiness creeps in as it sits, as does pin pricks of alcohol. Fairly balanced between sweetness and acidity.  Typically large Chimay yeast pour adds sharp yeast overtones, countering the spicy nature. Thickens the body and adds a cottony nature. Finishes spicy, hoppy yet mushy and bland. A fan of Chimay I am not, and never will be.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"

Head is not as rich as the Rouge and the alcoholic essence is a wee bit overpowering here.  The palate, too, is slightly askew--too much carbonation.  I liked the hint of floral/fruit in the flavor, as well as the yeastiness in the aroma.

Flavor starts off with some sweet malt tripel-type flavors, but quickly some spicy flavors and even a bit of hops are thrown into the mix.  Mouthfeel is a bit on the dry side, body is medium.  Finish has a touch of sweetness, but overall is very citrusy, peppery and spicy.  Quite a different Tripel than my mind had formed a gastric picture of, but certainly tasty.  Nice lacing, too.  Pretty good!  Lacking a certain degree of complexity that I was sort of hoping for, however, likely bred by the excellence of the ubiquitous Blue and Red.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

On tap its also very nice to drink. Maybe just a bit more sweet, less carbonation, less harsh hops and fuller. re-rate 03-16-2003: Re-rated this once again and still I it doesnt do it for me. Technically an ok beer, but the flavors, texture, carbonation and palate just arent mine. 03-18-1999, 2.7: Maybe I had an offday but I dont think its that great compared to the other Chimay beers.","Delft, NETHERLANDS","jbrus"

3246,"2001-08-27",3.7,"Big chunks of yeast are suspended in this red-orange, cloudy brew.  Reminded me of a pina colada in many respects, including flavor and aftertaste.  There are definite pineapple-coconut highlights and a white rum aftertaste.  Some bitterness, but overall a bit watery.  After sampling the final of three, I would say Red, Blue, and White in order from best to least.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"

Lots of malt and yeast in flavor and aroma which gives it a bready / fruity profile. The high alcohol is well balanced and not overwhelming. Served at cellar temperature brings out its complexities well. World class and worth the $$$.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

3246,"2000-04-26",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 7, 2003 Nominally in the tripel style, but so tart as to be quite different than most other tripels I've tried.  Aroma was pungent with green apples and fresh bread dough.  Copper-tinted yellow, fairly cloudy with suspended yeast, heavily carbonated with large foamy head, and thick heavy lace clinging all the way down the glass.  Head remained in bottom of glass.  Flavor is initially tart with more green apples, and a yeasty sourdough presence.  Finish is quite dry.  Like others of its style, this beer works well at a variety of temps.  When on the cold side, it has a tart refreshing crispness.  I prefer less cool, more at cellar temps, where the light sweetness comes through, balancing the tartness.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
