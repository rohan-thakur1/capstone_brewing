2507,"2015-05-24",3.1,"From 500 ml bottle. Pours a dark cola-like brown with a thin tan head that disappears almost entirely. Aromas of chocolate, black coffee, cinnamon and a little pine. Taste is smooth chocolate up front before a pine and coffee bean bitterness washes through. The body is pretty thin so it all falls away at the end, leaving a gentle fruity aftertaste.

Flavour is rather mild with roasted malts, cream, some bitterness, unpleasant earthy notes and harsh grains. Light bodied, thin mouthfeel and hard carbonation.

Of course the mouthfeel wasnt as strong as a chunky stout, but thats not the point. The idea (similarly to the Black Isle Breakfast Beer) is to create something that has some oomph in the tastebud-department to bridge against that low alcohol. 2 Craigs does that brilliantly.

2507,"2013-06-12",3.4,"Bottle at Anderson, Fortrose [100613] - Cheers Jonah!
Dark ruby brown, big frothy white head, some lacing
Aroma of pine and grapefruit hops, some lemon, the roast isnt coming through yet, good aroma for the abv
Taste of grassy hops, now the dark chocolate malts is coming through, touch of nettle hops, more chocolate malt and less lemon.
Palate - Yes its thin but theres a bit of oiliness from the oats, bit overcarbonated. Finish as main flavour, soft clean finish
Overall - Its only 2% so a thin texture is unavoidable and a degree of wateryness. It could probably be improved with a little touch more sweet dark malt in there - but overall its very good for such a low abv beer and certainly a good alternative for standard weaker beer","Near Carrick-on-Shannon, IRELAND","stravale"

Overall, really good - considering its low alcohol.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","AshtonMcCobb"
2507,"2013-05-30",3.8,"Cola brown body with an equally vicious carbonation hidden away, producing a porous sizeable tan head. The nose is on the peppery Porter side of things, rather than a creamy stout. Roast and oat straight away, but tied tight with a hoppy twine. Some chocolate as things soften up later on.
Initial taste is a bit of a loop-de-loop. Forcing a blind tasting of this on folk would be tonnes of fun. Kicks of rye and oat into a gravel spitting start before diffusing a lovely milky malt backbone and clean hop sweet spot. The flavours floated by the carbonation arent being pegged up with piney hops or weighed down with a creamy dark malt framework. This is the real jarring beauty here. Theres a woody roast trickle to the finish that youre expecting the entire rest of the time drinking this that in a weirdly frustrating way you just dont stumble across until the end. 
It took about 1/3rd of the bottle to really even things out taste wise with a ""watered down"" chocolate which was more like the awesome flavoured milk/Coco-Pops combo reward you get for letting your brain settle into things whilst still providing a sweet brown sugar sweet tang along with hops that stood firm across the board.
Really, really weird and really really excellent at the same time. I think the oats are tapered right on the money so it provides a superb refreshment whilst not overwhelming a spritely flavourful gear change for the finish. To not rely on a hop overhaul to make you forget the ABV and to still allow so many layers of flavour to shine through? Amazing work.
