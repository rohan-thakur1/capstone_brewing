692,"2016-05-18",3.3,"Nice deep brown coloured body with a large, off-white head, about four centimetres tall. Aroma of roasted malt, nuts, earth and a good dose of caramel sweetness from pure sugars. Medium-bodied; Assertive nutty and earthy flavour from the malt with a touch of sugar, some light mushroom and musty flavours and some subdued chocolate flavours. Aftertaste is fairly minimal with just malt and a little sweetness and mostly toasted malt flavours, all with a relatively thin body. Overall, a decent beer, but not showing much complexity, or depth in flavours - just the malt and sugars and not much else. Still, nice to try, and im sure the age helped mute the flavours to some degree. I sampled this 75 cL bottle purchased from Super Market Liqours in Fort Collins, Colorado on 17-March-2016 for US$6,99 sampled at Shenandoah National Park on 14-May-2016.

Medium bodied and malty, with modest but suitable carbonation, the taste was similar to the nose, remained lightly roasted and moderately sweet, and further added defining notes of light peat smoke, toffee, and caramel, balanced by a moderate, earthy hop bitterness.

Smell: A grainy edge atop sweetish caramel, figs, and, oddly enough, a hint of orange peel. Moistened cardboard and spirits round out the Sheep Eater.

Taste: A similar grainy start to the taste, some caramel brushed toast slices, and that papery, oxidized element jumping right in. Lightly fruity. Some alcohol hints, seemingly more than one would expect given the listed ABV percentage. Faint spiciness, some curious woodsy tones, and a smidgen of peat. All these things are butting their heads, disjointedly vying for your attention in finish. It culminates into just an odd taste.

Loved that even with all the malts and sweetish notes, it want nearly as overpoweringly sweet as the style can sometimes get.
