2981,"2015-06-04",2.2,"Sampled on draft at the source with Paul. After drinking Vermont beers for the weekend this was pretty harsh on the palate. Pours a clear golden body with no head; very light white lacing. Mouthfeel is sweet, thin and boozy with notes of dry, abrasive alcohol, spice, grain and sweet alcohol. It was tough to get this down. They do offer a shandy version with added lemonade, but Id rather just have lemonade.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
2981,"2012-03-10",2.8,"Bottle. Pours copper with white head. Nose/taste of sweet malt, corn and light white pepper. Mild lactose sourness. Medium body. Not bad.",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
2981,"2011-06-18",2.5,"Thanks to Alex... low carbonation, dark gold... sweet with a unique alcohol finish... the taste is really dead, almost boring but easy to drink so that could be a good thing","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
2981,"2011-04-22",3.0,"Awesome 40oz plastic capped bottle.  Pours a clear light copper body with a small fizzy white head that faded quickly.  The nose is quite a bit more pleasant than most Malt Liquors, some toasty malt, corn, and a light amount of alcohol.  The flavor is still pretty ""authentic"" to the classics of the style though.  Wet soggy grains and corn with a minimal alcohol flavor at least.  A good bit more tolerable than most, but still not a beer Id purchase with regularity.  Glad to have a go at it all the same.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
2981,"2011-03-17",3.0,"A - Pours a clear pale-golden color with just a touch of fizzy white head. The head quickly reduces to a ring leaving behind just a tad of lacing.

S - Aroma is very sweet, with the sweet malty aroma really dominating. There is also just a touch of apple and booze mixed in as well.

T - Starts off with a lot of sweetness coming from the carmel malt and also some corn syrup. Through the middle a touch of bitterness pops up but is quickly overtaken by the strong sweetness that stays around. The finish is the same carmel sweetness with just a touch of hop bitterness that lingers for a bit.

M - Fairly light bodied with a moderate-low amount of carbonation. There is also a real syrupy feel to the beer that really comes through in the aftertaste. It almost feel thick. However, it is still fairly crisp.

D - Fairly drinkable. The sweetness can come to be a bit much (considering it is a 40oz), but that being said it is a fairly pleasant malt liquor. The touch of hop taste really does help cut the bitterness a tad which is very nice.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"
2981,"2011-03-09",3.0,"Malt Liquor Appreciation Day 2011; 40 oz. bottle; thanks to dogfish120love for the trade over a year ago; SO this has been refrigerator aged to near perfection; pours clear, dark gold with thin white head; aromas of stale apples, thin malt, dry honey; grassy corn and dry cereal; pretty bland overall to me and nothing really jumps out; perhaps due to the lack of cancer causing chemicals, craft malt liquors cant age for decades like the BMC ones w/o any flavor drop off","Seattle, Washington, USA","SuzyGreenberg"
2981,"2011-03-06",3.6,"Nose of corn, sweet cereal grains, lightly fruity, a touch tangy. Pours golden orange, thin head, lots of floaties. The flavor is grainy and corny with light grassy hops, a touch of tangy fruit, more sweet grain. Rather authentic stuff here. Nice!","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
2981,"2011-01-29",2.7,"Hazy orange pour, fizzy white head.  Some corn and grainy malt in the aroma, touch of grass.  Taste has notes of corn and cereal, with a touch of hops and some sweetness.  Overall, not bad for malt liquor.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
2981,"2011-01-28",2.9,"40.  Poured hazy medium golden with a nice, looser-bubbled white head.. looked fairly well in the glass.  The aroma picked up sweet, syrupy corn syrup, cereal, and pale malts, with light floral and vanilla accents.. fairly well balanced and not too strong.  The flavor found ground corn, pale malts, and lighter fruity notes at the core.. more peppery notes and some tangy notes around.. finished slightly warm with flaked corn and peppery notes.  Medium-bodied with lower carbonation on the palate.. balance was solid, and this was quite drinkable.  Id drink it again.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
2981,"2011-01-28",3.0,"Thanks Jason.  The beer pours to a hazy golden body with a thin white head.  Sexy glowing vibrancy.  The aroma is average malts and some light grassy hops.  The flavor is sweet corn and barley with some grassy hops.  The palate is medium-light bodied.  A little grainy.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
2981,"2010-01-27",3.2,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2010 I love even being able to rate this style as a craft beer enthuisiate. This lovely beer pours a golden  bright yellow with very little head. The aroma is strong  and filled with adjuncts like corn and cereal. I dont really know how to rate this. Smells like corn and cereal. For what i is, its tasty","Westfield, Massachusetts, USA","dogfish120love"
2981,"2010-01-03",3.7,"Consumed out of the limited 40oz bottle (very glad to have this bottle in my collection). Very perfumy, hoppy taste. Not typically malt liquor-like in the sense that it is craft-brewed and not macro-brewed but the essence is there. Low carbonation leads me to believe I should have left it for about 6 months before trying it.","Ontario, CANADA","d07c0m"
2981,"2009-12-27",2.3,"Clear amber, thin white head. Aroma is lemon and skunky earthy grain. Flavor is slightly bitter with a lot of sweetness. Thin body.","Washington, USA","Beerona97"
2981,"2009-12-07",3.5,"this is really the best malt liquor i have ever had.nice malty backbone with a slight wheat finish.good stuff indeed.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Odeed"
2981,"2009-11-01",3.1,"Large, soda-pop styled bubbles during the pour. Short lasting; some spots of lace on the glass.  Slightly hazy.  Gold color

Earthy aroma; dry.

The flavor is much like the smell.  Quite dry.  If I were blindfolded, I would think of this as a malty pale ale.  Good body.  No notable alcohol characteristics.  Mild hop.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","smcolw"
2981,"2009-08-15",3.0,"Bottle sample at Noogfest High 5. Poured pale with a white head that settled to a ring. Earthy wood aroma with light spices, hops and a hint of rubbing alcohol. Flavor found pepper maltiness. Light body.","Huntsville, Alabama, USA","BeerHawk"
2981,"2009-08-06",1.9,"Sampled at Noogfest High 5.  Let me start by saying that I am normally a big malt liqour fan.  But this beer did not do it for me. Pours a clear yellow with no real head to speak of. Lots of corniness, and very sweet and metallic with huge amounts of alcohol flavor and butter and pepper.  Reminded me of rubbing alcohol.  For only 7.5%, this was rediculously alcoholic.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Butters"
2981,"2009-07-19",2.7,"Pours with virtually no head.  Color is darkish brass.  Light fruit cocktail, a little banana in the aroma.  Flavor is lightly sweet with alcohol and not much else. Not bad for a malt liquor.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","RCL"

Poured clear copper color with a moderate frothy white head that mostly lasting with fair lacing. Medium grainy  sweet aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium grainy sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration.

2981,"2009-07-06",3.2,"I tend to rate malt liqour to style sorry bout that but this is one of the top dogs. Woof Woof! A golden color with a malty corn, grass, and lemon filled aroma. The flavor is also rather malty with little alchol detected. Some grassy notes and corn show through. Overall this would be a hell of a 40 to sip with yo home boys!","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
2981,"2009-07-05",2.1,"Noogfest High 5. The body was bright gold with with thin white head on top. The aroma was corn and soybeans with not much else to smell. The flavor was strongly bitter with raw corn. There was grass and lots of booze. Pretty good for a malt liquor.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
2981,"2009-07-01",2.7,"Sampled at Noogfest High 5. Pours clear yellow with a hint of white head. The aroma is corn husk, funk, grain, and hay. The flavor is fruit and corn, hayish hops, and a weird laundry detergent note. This is hilarious if nothing else.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"
2981,"2009-06-24",2.9,"Quick review:
40oz brown glass plastic resealable top. No date.
Poured into an imperial pint with no head at all. Medium amber color. Nose is clean and light with some dry-hop notes, but rather closed. Palate is a flash of sweetness up front and then dry, almost British-like hops clean house. Not a bitter beer, but not a sweet strong lager either. Hops keep all in check and bottle conditioning probably makes a major difference here in terms of not being a sweet strong-lager.

The best malt liquor Ive had yet, but Im still not hugely impressed.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","SFLpunk"
