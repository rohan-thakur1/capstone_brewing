Aftertaste of the same, accompanied by a slight hint of red wine. Overall, this one is a bit too sweet for my liking, but the qualities underlying this sweetness still make this brew shine.

2340,"2016-08-25",3.2,"33cl bottle at Sportbar Time Out, Waarschoot (24 VIII 2016). Listed on the beer map as ""Carolus Donker"". This is the ""classic"" Malines brown ale, which has already yielded worldwide recognition and hence global beer awards. The appearance is a lovely smooth black ale with reddish gloom. On top there is a quite long lasting, yellow pale beige coloured collar. The brew already has a kind off sticky body - which looks appealing. The nose contains huge amounts of malts, a lingering bitterness, dish water and a coffee backbone. These coffee flavoures actually are downtuned towards a cup of watery, weak coffee. Also, the nose is flavoured with keen yeast features, brown sugar, and some cellar, dust, dirt and even turf notes - making this a truly Belgian styled brown ale. Apart from the interesting coffee touch, I would not value this ale as an appealing world-class brew. Im glad the taste is the trump card for this Gouden Carolus Classic. The mouthfeel is rather medium than heavy sweet, with a firm dextrose hint. One can even discover standard sugar cubes, making the sweetness rather artificial. The body itself does not account for a super strong backbone. The malts have a crisp grains feeling, on the tongue there is a certain degree of oxydation: I know this brew can age very well, yet I would drink this bottle fresh without metallic annoyances. The mouthfeel also has a fruityness, alas with a too abrupt finish, but it is allright. Think of dry fruit, blue berries even, unripe strawberries. Almost too subtle, there are sour dashes present. The warming alcohol feature is perfectly balanced, built around the taste sensation. All in all, this wellknown brew is not top notch. But the looks and taste arent bad, for sure, with well balanced coffee and fruity aspects.","Waarschoot, BELGIUM","Hamirubi"

2340,"2016-03-10",3.7,"Pours very dark from the bottle with a thin tan head that turns wispy before fading away. The aroma is characterized by a strong malt presence, something in the direction of resin and, more unfortunately, rubbing alcohol. With exposure to air the more malodorous aspects lessen a a steady caramel aroma asserts itself. First taste is prickly, sweet, and the palate full and robust. Burnt caramel malt and bread dominate, with a chocolate undertone, and a light candy sweetness. The 8.5 ABV is well disguised, both on the initial quaff and the long caramel sweet finish. The range of taste is not particularly broad. A faint cherry fruitiness, once or twice hinted at, fails for example to make it out from under the burnt caramel overtone. Still this beer is, despite its flaws, a pleasure to drink and any qualms might be described as suffering at a high level. Interesting and quite good.","Butzbach, Hesse, GERMANY","hauxe"

Aspecto: De color ambarino muy oscuro, situándose en la gama de tonos que se encuentran a medio camino entre los marrones y los rojizos, similar a un brandy. Presenta un aspecto muy atractivo con una capa de espuma blanca y esponjosa, con buena amplitud, pero que sin embargo no tarda mucho en desaparecer.
Aroma: Compleja, desprende aromas afrutados, entre los que destacan frutos dulces como las ciruelas, higos, e incluso un punto de plátano, junto con otros algo más ácidos como cerezas y curaçao. También destacan notas de malta y caramelo, con un punto de miel, nuez moscada, levadura, y muy levemente aparecen los lúpulos por debajo de toda esta capa de aromas frutales y dulzones.
Sabor y textura: Se trata de una cerveza de cuerpo medio, y carbonatación no muy elevada, aunque se aprecia cierto cosquilleo y picor en la lengua, apoyado por las especias. De sabor potente, donde aparece la malta por encima de los demás, y los sabores dulces a pasas y frutos oscuros, se experimentan sensaciones que nos recuerdan a los aromas detectados anteriormente, acercándonos al gusto de un vino oporto.

La Gouden Carolus Classic laisse apparaitre dans le nez des arômes maltés et très fruités qui évoque le caramel, les prunes et les raisins. Une touche anisée est également perceptible.
On découvre ensuite sur le palais des saveurs elles aussi maltées et fruitées avec un aspect un peu liquoreux. Des notes torréfiées accompagnent des saveurs de fruits noirs et de fruits secs. On retrouve notamment des notes de prunes, de pruneaux, de raisins et de raisins secs. Associées à l'alcool, ces saveurs de fruits noirs rappellent certaines liqueurs de fruits.

2340,"2014-11-07",3.7,"Classic in every sense of the word, this beer has been in existence since the fifties, but underwent a certain change in the late nineties. Allegedly a derivative of the Mechelsen bruynen emperor Charles V enjoyed back in the sixteenth century, this is the flagship of Flanders oldest brewery. The current version displays a pale beige, sticky, lacing, thinnish but stable head and a clear wine-red colour with little to no visible fizz. Strongly perfumed aroma of cookie dough, port wine, butterscotch, chocolate liqueur, orange peel, coriander seed, cooked corn, baked banana, liquorice, cardamom, star aniseed, apple cake, gingerbread, old cognac, raisins, hints of sour yoghurt, meat and fresh paint, as well as a (luckily) very, very weak hint of nail polish remover. Taste reveals a truckload of candied fruits, sweet in a sugary and spicy kind of way, resinous and smooth mouthfeel with soft carbonation, ubiquitous toffee-like and caramelly malts, a bit oily, candi syrup sweetness cloying a bit, insufficiently balanced with leafy, drying hop bitterness and warming, port-like alcohol. The candi sugary sweetness lingers too much, making it hard for me to pour down and sticking to tongue and throat, yet the aroma is fantastic. I remember this in its old guise, without the weary corn, refermented in the bottle and with the old label; it was equally sweet, but yeastier and more natural back then, but in its current form, this is still an important Belgian, one of those old-time favorites and a must taste. I do not like overtly sweet beers but in this case, the complex aroma makes it easy to forgive; it would benefit from less sugar, though. Lets see how the three remaining bottles age in the cellar: if they become anything like that special 58 version I tasted of this, Im sure I have invested in a certain amount of happiness five or more years from now...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

2340,"2014-09-07",3.6,"Transfer from BA review on 4-13-13-

 Poured from bottle into a chalice glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a dark brown color with a one finger cream colored head that fades relatively quickly. Upon fading, over about a one minute time period, a lighter level of lace is left on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is a mix of a lightly roasted and bready malt as well as aromas of sweet sugary and darker fruit smell. The heaviest of the malt is a roasted barley malt but there are notes of chocolate and coffee mixed within as well. The sugary smells are mainly of a caramel nature and are mixed with fruit aromas of a raisin, prune and fig. Rounding out all these are aromas of some alcohol as well as some spicy smells and a bit of an earthy hop smell.

 Taste  The taste begins sweet with flavors of a caramel and a whole lot of dark fruits. The dark fruits are mainly of a prune flavor but have some hints of a raisin and fig flavors mixed within. There are flavors of a roasted malt breadiness upfront as well, which ends up fading ever so slightly as the flavor advances. As the breadines fades, a coffee and chocolate taste begins taking its place. While the flavor advances further, so too comes some of the spice flavors that were detected in the nose (nutmeg and cinnamon). A rather decent potent rum flavor as well as a bit of a woody and earthy flavor then come to the tongue more at the end where it melds well with the prune and darker chocolate and coffee flavors to leave an odd warming flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel- The beer is on the medium side in terms of its thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the average side. A little lighter of a body may actually have suited the odd mix of fruity flavor and darker flavors better due to the complementation of the fruit and drinkability and lessening of the chocolate and coffee flavors.

 Overall  The chocolate and coffee flavors were a little odd in this brew and took away from the nice blend of fruit, malt and rum tastes. Not bad, but not the best Belgian strong dark out there","","Darkmagus82"

A nice pop when I pulled the cork but no gushing, thankfully, it pours a clear? deep mahogany with a 2 finger hof and of course, nice lacing.

Lots of caramel malt, mixed with some toffee and fruity notes in the smell. Pitted fruits, me thinks. No, Im thinking of a Bartlett. Anywho, its a very nice aroma going on.

I do appreciate the pear flavour Im getting straight off. Toffee follows and something semi sweet..Ill read the label...molasses? Okay. Nothing realy on the bitter side going on but this is not an overly sweet brew either. 

Sipping further in, I get a mild heat from the alcohol but its not a huge distraction.

Pops with a decent noise, but not fierce by any means. Poured unclear dark brown/amber with thin and quick dissolving head. Smell is plums, dark fruits, touch leather and some known oxidation notes. Taste is, well, over the hill for sure. Dark fruits are still there, but it is quickly dominated by soy, cardboard, syrup soaked leather (weird right). Well, now comes the time to rate the beer and I hate to bc this is merely a shell of its former self. However, my measly rate will not ding the 1164 ratings that preceded me. Bottom line.

2340,"2013-09-17",4.2,"11.2 oz bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours a murky dark brown color. The head is a two finger mocha shade, settling down to one finger relatively quick. Nonetheless, general retention is good, as is the soft, creamy texture. Thin streaks of lacing are left on the glass.

S: There are plenty of plums on the aroma, as well plenty of milk chocolate. Caramel and brown sugar also abound in conjunction with a well balanced note of bready yeast, pears, and apples. Really, its not far off from a great quad - or Keizer Blauw for that matter.

T: Opening flavors are very strong in brown sugar sweetness. Its caramely in a good way. Dark fruit flavors (plums, raisins, and the like) build up in the midtaste before the dry finish...thats also laden with dark fruits. While its fairly sugary, its balanced just enough so to become non-cloying. Complexity is only lacking next to the aforementioned Keizer Blauw: this still has very good depth, even within the style.

M: The back end is moderately dry. I like that, by the way - it helps quash some (if not all) of the sweetness. Not a hint of alcohol is felt or tasted on the palate, but there is a slight warming sensation down the esophagus.

O: Excellent. Not sure why I held onto this single for so long, because Im really digging this. Very flavorful and sweet, yet approachable and balanced enough. Fantastic dessert beer, and I wish I had more than a single of this.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

overall: I must say, my first one didnt really do it for me. So it probably depends on my mood. The second one was very enjoyable. Its a very easy and sweet beer. You dont get much of the alcohol due the sweetness. I like the yeasty, dark fruit and brown sugar and nutty aroma combo. If i had to criticize it, it would probably be that its maybe too sweet.

Very impressive appearance! Deep brown colour, with a beige head, three fingers tall, thick and with excellent retention. Heavy lacing around the glass. Red grapes on the aroma, sugars, plums, just a bit of alcohol on the back and another bit of vanilla.

Perfect mouthfeel, if not for the style, surely for my taste. Full, thick body,  oily but at the same time somewhat sticky on the palate, and the perfect amount of carbonation.

The aroma is enticing with its Belgian sugars, brown sugar, dark malts, yeast, plum, and vaguest of alcohol bite. The body is bold.  The taste begins sweet and malty with well-integrated alcohol and a peppery, slightly lingering finish. Prime stuff.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"

2340,"2012-07-12",4.4,"Bière emblématique de la brasserie, et une véritable énigme.
Cette classique ne lest en effet que dans le nom, parce que sa dominante est 
assurément exotique...
Alors que veut dire classique ? Selon toute vraisemblance, on signifie par là 
que la brune est la première bière par choix esthétique dans la gamme.
On ne peut que saluer le très haut score de cette bière, sans ambigüité au niveau
du choix des dégustateurs, mais on sait que les pils sont les bières les plus vendues 
dans le monde...
Donc essayons de comprendre...
Couleur foncée très jolie, mousse beige qui nappe bien, malgré 8 mois de plus que la 
date limite pour mon exemplaire... (mais le brasseur parle de conservation illimitée!!!).
Arômes de noix, champignons humides, bois de teck, pain bis. 
Volume soyeux. Tout va se jouer maintenant dans la 1ère gorgée...
Ce 1er goût est vraiment surprenant : une pointe de genièvre sur du fruit très mûr, avec
du pruneau au vin rouge, de la pêche de vigne et une pointe de porto tawny...
2ème bouche sur la groseille noire, le raisin sec et le cassis. Pas du tout déquilibre.
3ème bouche sur le vin de noix, le sureau, les haricots blancs et le cassis encore.
Le bois exotique en arrière bouche.
La levure est pourtant très douce pour ce type de bière !!!
Le nez suivant fait apparaître un peu de pain complet... Les céréales vont-elles arriver
à transparaître ? Oui, dans la longueur lorge malté arrive, du genre bien sûr torréfié et
chocolaté, mais il est là. Le houblon par contre est vraiment un élément mystérieux ici.
Sans doute dans la pointe de sureau, mais je voudrais connaître la variété...
La finale fait ressentir en bouche un goût de fût de maturation, avec un côté vin de
garde, sous-bois dautomne.
Lalcool vient soutenir ces sensations, mais sur un niveau sans trop de chaleur (8,5 abv),
présent sans exagération.
Donc on ne peut parler de classique, pas du tout, mais dune bière au contraire originale.
Mais le mot « original » se réfère aussi aux « origines », donc classique... On ne va pas

Dunkelbraunes, hefiges Bier mit schöner Schaumkrone. Dunkle Schokoladen- und Kakaonoten neben der Hefigkeit. Vollmundiger Antrunk, voluminöse Malznoten im Mittelteil und leicht nachbitternd im Abgang mit leichter Fruchtigkeit nach Brombeeren. Einziger Kritikpunkt ist der zu hohe Alk-Gehalt, der teilweise zu dominant ist und die Süffigkeit trübt. Weniger wäre hier mehr gewesen. Nichtsdestotrotz ein gutes Dubbel!

If youve ever had coffee syrup to mix in milk, you will recognize the sweet aged molasses taste of this beer. Its less hoppy than some of the other Carolus beers, or at least it has more malt.

It includes lots of raisins, prunes and, caramel, plus molasses, toffee, tobacco, roasted malt, chocolate, and a little yeast spiciness. At first the taste was too sweet for me, but it got more interesting as it warmed up.  The first sip made me wonder if this was beer or a sweet wine.  Has a drier but malty finish.. Carbonation is light to moderate and bodiy is almost full.  Mouthfeel is creamy and slick but enjoyable.    Alcohol is noticeable only on the first whiff and when your are finished.   Overall a very enjoyable, special, and complex brew no matter what syle you call it.  Its taste, complexity, and buzz  remind me of my all-time favorite: Schneider-Aventinus Weizen Eisbock.

A brown 33cl bottle, best before 12st Oct 2011, drank on a damp and cold Jan evening in 2009. Poured into a Corsendonk tulip shapped glass. Deep red, dark ruby when held to a light source with a good solid foaming head, tan in colour. Sweet liquorice hits my nose, candy without the floss, a realy interesting aroma. The sweet liquorice smell is in the taste too, very prominent. Red and Blackberry tones bring the sweetness into check and the beer is a fine blend of differing flavours which merge into a great tasting beer. The 8.5% ABV isnt masked completely, but it is well hidden by the richness of the beers body adding a luscious, sumptuous, mellow feel to the experience. An elaborate and elegant, highly-flavoured beer that was a joy to drink and review. There are not many beers better than this out there!

Quite sweet stuff, and if Ive understood my Master of Tasting (i.e. ClubGonzo) correctly, the sweet sugary caramel thing is dark candi sugar. Any objections? Anyway, a very pleasant aroma indeed! The sweetness is obvious in the taste as well: moderate to heavy sweet initial taste while this finish is moderate to light bitter. Flavours of alcoholic dried dark fruits with dark caramel. Goody!

buona intensità, con lieviti in primo piano che si mescolano con note di caramello, frutta secca (fico, prugna) e sullo sfondo qualche nota alcolica che fornisce una sensazione quasi vinosa			
[ GUSTO ]			
inzia con un dolce pronunciato che cede poco a poco spazio a sapori di frutta matura, quasi candita; rimangono evidenti i lieviti ed un leggero tocco acidulo conduce al finale dove entrano in scena soavemente gli 8.5 gradi che dinamicizzano un poco il palato con note piccantine. il dolce rimane comunque persistente e si prolunga nel retrogusto dove a fatica si ritrova qualche nota amara.			
[ TEXTURE ]			
corpo medio, morbida in bocca, caronatazione nella media, alcohol avvertito sopratutto nel finale  e retrogusto			
COMMENTO FINALE			
dopo la versione natalizia, questa classica risulta maggiormente proiettata verso note dolci (strano ma vero); colpa 
forse di un un fruttato meno intenso e complesso, una alcolicità più soave, che se da una parte la rende più scorrevole e morbida al palato, dallaltra priva di un giusto bilanciamento le note dolci, mancando quel tocco amaro-speziato ritrovato nella christmas . A mio giudizio personale, un pelino sotto la natalizia, rimanendo come preferita la Gouden Carolus Hopsinjoor.","(Madrid","molly75"

2340,"2011-12-27",4.2,"This is a very pleasant Belgian Strong, the 5th Ive tried in this style. Its not quite on par with Rochefort 8, which has a better nose on it, anyway I digress. I had Rochefort 8 in a Trappist glass, this in a large goblet like wine glass maybe that changed this. The nose is sweet, rich, dark fruits, sherry like but not as heavy. The appearance is dark brown, an initial frothy head goes to a lace. The taste of this is beautiful, roasty, fruity, brown sugar. On the palate its a medium carbonation which puts me off giving it a full 5/5, oily on the tongue but its full bodied, the high alcohol presence is obvious reminding me of Duvel. Its a good beer, for £3.14 a bottle in Micro Bar, Manchester a bargain, very happy to have tried this one.","Chapel en le Frith, Derbyshire, ENGLAND","AleManTom"

2340,"2011-08-20",4.0,"33cl bottle. Pours a chestnut colour with a red hue. There is a decent head but not quite what you expect from a well executed Belgian strong ale. The nose has very intense aromas of stewed apples, raisins and spice (ginger and nutmeg I think). The taste has massive notes of dates and raisins, this very slowly falls away and there is ginger cake and then liquorice on the end. The palate is huge on entry and it keeps going for a long time but halfway through there is a tangy note which eventually cleans the palate if the sweetness. It only just hides the alcohol but as they say by such small measures are battles lost or in this case won. A very complex and weighty beer!","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","AshtonMcCobb"

2340,"2010-06-22",4.0,"330ml bottle - $3.99 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours out an opaque, darkened walnut brown body with a modest-sized, short-lived, ivory-hued head.

Smell: A bright, spirited nose, smelling of muscovado sugar, chocolate, freshly-grated spices, rum raisin ice cream, and fruit jams both lightly tart and sweet.

Taste: A sweet, sweet beginning, with chocolate stirred up with sticky, sugary treacle. A slideshow of various tastes carouses the tongue: sweet cherries, dates, macerated raisins, black licorice, and a teensy weensy hint of spearmint gum. After some minutes, it starts to even hint at Mr. Pibb. Notable alcohol warmth on the fruity, semi-dry finish.

Other flavors are nuts, resin, bubblegum, and dough. This beer was easy to drink and complex. I could see myself drinking 2 or 3 because of the complexity and flavor.

A - Dark mahogany amber color with a large, thicky, creamy, frothy, very light beige head. Very good retention and a nice thick creamy lacing left.

S - Nice mix of fruit and spiced (orange, some dark fruit, coriander, and clove) and some dark malt, molasses/brown sugar, caramel, and some rum soaked fruit.

T - Initially fairly sweet with a good amount of caramel and toffee malt, some banana and bubblegum (similar to a dunkelwizen), and some fruitiness (both citrusy and dark fruit along with some golden fruit). Then some of the spices (clove in particular but also coriander and other typical Belgian spices) come out and there is a bit more of a kick. Faint hints of chocolate and licorice in the background, not much but just enough to be detected every once in a while. Finishes with a good amount of fruity flavors and the malt lingers a bit after the sip.

M - Light to medium body, pretty light for the style, with slightly above average carbonation. Somewhat sticky flavors but the beer is a little smooth, not really creamy though.

D - Good drinkability. Good amount of fruit and sweetness but not cloying or over the top. Easy to drink with a nice mix and balance of flavors. A bit of a sipper, but the alcohol is very well hidden.

Notes: A very nice beer to sip on. A good amount of full fruity flavors including dark fruit, golden fruit, and citrus all mixing (dark most prominent). It is a bit digestif liqueur/port like in that it is pretty fruity and full flavors. Very enjoyable easy to drink beer.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Now for a more recent rating: Garnet brown pour with 1.5 fingers of lively foam.

Appearance: Very deep amber brown color with a small, foamy, tan head.
Aroma: Big, boozy, wine-like nose.  Red wine notes, wood, and berries.
Flavor: Sweet, malty, and rich.  Vinous notes, a bit of red grape, blackberry, sweet dark honey, dark brown sugar, some earth and wood.  A touch on the sweet side but still quite delicious.
Palate: High carbonation gives it a somewhat lighter mouthfee and cuts through some of the richness.  A medium-short, sweet finish.
Overall: Truly a classic and worth trying for sure.  Not quite to the level of a Struise Pannepot or Rochefort 8, but good none the less.  Recommended.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

Opened the bottle and foam spewed out of it, despite it having been stored carefully upright with no major movement.

Smell was huge, sweet malty and dark druits. Alcohol too. Great smell. However taste not quite so huge. Had a sharp mouthfeel (probably because of the sediment) with licorice, chocolate and sweet biscuit overtones. Sharpness distracted from the taste substantially.

2340,"2008-06-28",3.8,"Little bottle. Pours fairly dark, kind of a mahogany and a decent head even in a Trappist glass. The aroma is sweet, malty, with light esters. Subtle hints of clove, coriander, banana, chocolate pudding are all hinted. Its a soft, rounded aroma with little to no sharpness or bitterness. The flavor is much the same with a sweet, malty back bone highlighted by yeasty notes. The only suggestion of dryness is faint in the finish, this is definitely a juicy brew. Along with the spicy esters I get delicate hints of fruits: pears, grapes. This is a very well executed Belgian brew.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

2340,"2008-04-22",3.6,"33cl. bottle at home: Ok, confused... its says unfiltered and bottle-conditioned, yet the bottle has absolutely no sediment on the bottom and the beer is gorgeously clear! Rich brilliant deep red/garnet color with an almost perfect creamy tan head, if only it could stick around a bit longer. Powerful aromas of dark rich fruits in sweet delcious cake... I suppose we would call that fruitcake. Plums, raisin, dried berries mixed with winter spices and light-molasses or treacle. Just a bit of dark Havana rum soaked deeply into the fruitcake. Quite sweet taste with black grapes and mixed dark fruit infused tea leading way to an almost lactose sugar quality. Just as it crosses the ""too-sweet"" threshold it pulls back into deep malt, dark caramel and burnt sugar. Finally reaching into light coffee and a slight herbal yeast. Considering its upfront sweetness, it dries out enough in the end to not be sticky sweet. Halfway down the glass and that upfront sweetness does start to fade (or you get used to it) and the beer benefits from that. Alcohol fades in and out through burnt sugars.","Brasschaat, BELGIUM","CapedBrewsader"

2340,"2006-10-03",3.6,"Concentrated notes of sweet plums and raisins waft from my glass as I pour this beer, there is also a touch of something like rum.  The beer is quite well carbonated and produces a frothy, easily three-finger thick, tan colored head even after carefully pouring this into my tulip glass.  The beer is a hazy, dark amber color that has deep purple overtones.  An interesting aroma is on this one; it certainly smells rich and decadent.  Notes of concentrated, caramelized brown sugar lead to something akin to cinnamon (though not quite) and some definite prune like notes.  Woody fig notes lend a sort of dryness here, but the more you delve into the aroma the more concentrated and varied the rich concentrated fruit notes get.  The concentrated fruit character never takes on a sharp, exaggerated fruitiness, but instead remains rounded by the caramelized malt core that makes up this beer.

Definitely sweet, this beer has a heft to it that sticks to the palate and in fact coats it as the beer passes through my mouth.  It finishes with a certain chalkiness that makes me think that this might have started to oxidize.  It has not reached the point of cardboard, but it may have started down that path.  Perhaps cardboard is not the best descriptor as this beer still has ample room to move towards much more pleasing notes of sherry, which I definitely get hints of already.  Rum like notes of brown sugar and molasses linger on the tongue as a touch of alcohol warms my chest.  This has lots of concentrated, caramelized malt flavors.  It is almost has a toffee like edge to it, but with only a touch of the butter character.

This is quite the sipping brew, each sip is rich and complex enough to be contemplative, and it is certainly thick enough that quaffing large draughts of this at a time would not be pleasant.  It is right on the edge of being too sweet; it has achieved a great amount of richness without being overly sweet, but just so as any more would be sticky and cloying.  In the end I think this is a touch too sweet, it has certainly been an enjoyable way to end the evening though.

2340,"2006-06-24",3.9,"As its name supposes the Carolus Classic is indeed a true archetype of the dark Belgian ales. Its mesmerizing lateritious hue is subtly clouded and rises to an oat-colored creamy head, exemplary of the style. An overwhelming fragrance of bananas emerges initially and follows in a suite of dried pears, raisins and figs. The warm, vinous touch offers a definite density to the nose, one supported by the indubitable scent of walnuts, pepper and the candy-like aroma of artificial cherries. Fruits are equally pronounced in the flavor, particularly in the recurrent vehemence of dried bananas, followed by plums and cherries again. The sweet, sticky almost syrupy texture contributes a certain weight to the dark malt background of coffee, roasted chocolate and caramel weaving an immaculate framework for the assertive nutmeg and anise tonalities. Alcohol is certainly present but does not burn, and for a turophile like myself gives the apropos strength to perfectly match a Chabichou or a similarly soft goat cheese. The aftertaste leads to a beautiful evolution starting with coffee and marrons glacés that finishes with the lingering piquant of licorice.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

2340,"2006-06-11",3.8,"My 900th review and not a bad one. Poured a red-brown color with a nice pillowy tan head in the tulip glass. The lacing was great on the way down, a combination of rings and spotty foam. Aroma was super rich from the pop of the cap, rich dark fruits permeating the air with lots of strength and a touch of caramel. Delicious smelling. Flavor wasnt as good (hey, its got lots of competition within style), but decent. Flavor gets credit for complexity, anyway: dark fruits, (raisins and plums), caramel, molasses, and light chocolate underneath. A bit sharp in the flavor, maybe even slightly astringent and vinous. Put this one away for years and it would probably improve much. But, for now, its nothing like the Kaizer, and, well... the flavor of the Noel was much better.","","User37895"

Easy to forget the classics. Sweet milk chocolate early, some Belgian stink, low fizz, very smooth. Cant drink em all day but great fun.
Vintage: September 2006
Consumed: January 2009
3 years looks about right for this beer. Fresh bottlings have shown a heavy palate with plenty of stewed fruit malts but some medium term cellaring has certainly lightened the beer up. Aromas show a lot of life with funky, meaty, stinky malts and a hint of sarsparella. Chocolate, licorice and cola flavours emerge early in the palate but the intensity thins out as a woody note kicks in. Nice sliver of chocalate runs right through the palate. Not convinced additional cellaring will enhance the beer further.
Vintage: unknown
Consumed: September 2005
Thin head, light coffee in colour.  Body is very dark brown. Shows ok lacing. Nose is quite rich, candied, heavy, slightly stewed malts. Heavy weight palate with lots going on, good complexity. Starts out relatively light early in the palate with more heavy, slightly roasted malts but then transcends to some excellent licorice. People talk about licorice in shiraz but this beer shows much better (and obvious) flavour definition. Finishes just a touch short with some alcohol burn, this in itself is not a deal breaker.","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"

Very enjoyable though not my favourite from this fine brewery.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
2340,"2005-09-10",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2005 Bottle (330ml).  Poured a murky orange-brown, some sediment, decent creamy tan head - leaves a pretty light tan lacing behind.  Aroma oaky, resiny, with masses of musty, brown sugary, caramel malt, some sour wine, oil-based paint, various fruits and spices, some alcohol, even a hint of peat - very woody and mysterious.  Taste is extremely malty, toffee/caramel, brown sugar; the alcohol asserts itself quickly, but settles into a decent balance with the malt and a medley of spices and fruits, also a bit leafy and woody.  But this is *malt*, my friends - ""suffer or leave"".  Mouthfeel is primarily alcholic and sticky, but its got decent body too, as well as enough carbonation to suit me.  Id rate this higher, but I was expecting more complexity based on the nose.  Still highly recommended.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

Draught @ PBF. Excellent. Wonderful dubbel - amber type looks with thick tan head that lasts very well. One of the best looking beers I have seen. Typical Gouden Carolus behaviour all round.

2340,"2005-08-02",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2006 Best before 07/12/06.  Dark brown beer with a ruby tint.  Nice sweet fruity and malty aroma, plum/prune, caramel/toffee apple, black pepper and cardamon.  Full bodies, malty sweetness, plummy with heavy notes of bread and toast.  Lingering yeasty spice, a bit of wheaty tartness and some other fruity acidity.  Nice complexity.

Tap at Mugs Ale House.  I wanted to re-rate this with a few more years on it, so here it is.  Deep brown with a ruby tint.  Nose is peppery and lightly alcoholic over sweet slightly oxidized malts.  Sherryish and pruney with sweet dried fruit in back.  Plums and raisins on the nose.  The flavour is still very sweet with brown sugar and dried fruits.  Slightly alcoholic which helps cut the sweetness, but its still too sweet and chewy.  I thought that some age would have dried this out, but it doesnt seem to have done that.  It has added some nice sherry character to the sweet maltiness.  I dont think its going to improve with any more age on it though.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

Update (12/1/2011):  This beer is needs the right vessel.  I used the Chimay goblet-style glass.

Very dynamic flavor. Licorice characteristics up front, red and black, but mainly black. Caramel and toffee come about next and shortly there after, it moves to the fruit with plums and candied coated raisins.

 Probably my palate had evolved, but this is a fantastic beer. It tastes like X-mas. Rum raisin flavors predominate, but malty bread pudding is in there too. This is quickly becoming a favorite.

Bottle courtesy of Matta. Thanks. Sweet slightly spicy, alcoholic aroma. Beautiful  dark brown color. Almost looks like heavily concentrated tea. Sweet and incredibly smooth taste. Highly drinkable and even has a bit of a hop finish. Real nice beer.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"

2340,"2004-09-03",3.3,"Pours almost black with a creamy tan head.  Aroma heavy on yeast and sweet caramel.  Flavor is sweet and malty, with a fruity/vinous character and a hoppy, dry finish.  Nothing spectacular, but a good, solid Belgian.","Melbourne, Florida, USA","desurfer"
2340,"2004-09-01",3.8,"Pours a substantial, full and frothy head that dissipates rather quickly. A golden orange color with some haze, and an adequate amount of CO2. A resilient clinging lace. Rich fruity smell, with some hints of orange and yeast. The flavor is fruity sweet, almost syrupy, yet tart, with a lasting biting finish. The alcohol is well hidden, yet the warming effects can be felt quickly. The mouth feel was effervescent, lively and also creamy. A good beer with a distinct character, although I do not really care for the contrasting bite.","New Mexico, USA","igel"

2340,"2004-08-05",4.1,"Clear ruby-brown pour. Medium light brown head with decent lacing. Huge malty nose, tons of dark fruits, toasted notes, chocolatey richness, maybe even coffee, caramel and grapes reminiscent flavors, very estery anyway. Very appealing and powerful. In mouth, the typical initial Het Anker rich sweetness is luxuriously accompanied by drying out yeast. Smoky, woody and mineral long finish full of memories with an ever so slight alcohol hint and noble hop bitterness. Medium-full bodied, moderate to high carbonation, rich mouthfeel. Fantastic malty belgian, almost like a doppelbock, enormous level of sweetness included. Still, more balanced if not as rich as the grand cru, but perhaps less exciting than the noël as far as Im concerned. Thats a bit like comparing napoleon and alexander the great though. A must.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

2340,"2004-05-27",3.8,"Hazy, earthen, copper body with a thin, tan head.  Apples are all over the nose.  Im beginning to see that most of the beers from Het Anker.  Red grape, plum, apricot, fig, caramel, dark candy sugar, whole wheat bread and a light touch of alcohol.  Really, just very fruity.  The body is appropriately thick without becoming cumbersome.  The flavor resides mostly within the realm of sweetness.  A touch of roasted or bitter malt (or the crust of wheat bread) pops in and out, trying to balance.  The bitterness of the hops also try to enter the fray, without much success.  Ultimately, this is a decent Belgian, but one that could use a bit more balance.  Take your time with this one, for time will heal all wounds.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

Yeastiness fairly prominent in the taste alongside a huge caramel malt profile; if I didnt know this was Belgian Id swear it was a doppelbock.

Deep brownish red color, opaque, with a fine and intricately patterned head.  Flavor derives primarily from malt and yeast, with an overriding, vinous, estery fruitiness, dark sugar and faintly spicy hop.  Finish is long, tangy, bittersweet and gently alcoholic.

2340,"2003-02-16",3.8,"The dark caramel color looked fabulous in the official Gouden Carolus glasses.  The head was healthy and entertaining (I like to watch it settle).  The aroma was subtle and pleasing to the nose.  The assault on the tongue was slow, and the caramel and oak flavors eventually subsided to the spike of the carbonation that lingered on the tongue afterwards.  About half way through the glass, there was a noticable oily feel left on the roof of the mouth and tongue.  I imagine that was what caused the flavor to linger like it did.","San Francisco, California, USA","omnivore"

2340,"2002-11-24",4.0,"On the pour, the beer appears to be a somewhat caliginous cherry red color, the head Bunyanesque in size, the texture creamy, with sticky sheets of lace to caress the glass. Nose is fruit sweet, over ripe apples and or banana comes to mind, malt tones and light caramel hints also present a treat for the old honker to sniff. The start is honey sweet, the top lean, the finish is pleasantly acidic, cheerfully hopped, dry and somewhat alcohol bitter aftertaste. Yes, it does Warm the Tummy, and should definitely be put in the Winter Warmer category. If you like strong high ABV beer this is a must try, but you may find it a bit pricey at $10.49 a 750ml bottle. Personally I dont mind the price, because Im Worth It Baby!
