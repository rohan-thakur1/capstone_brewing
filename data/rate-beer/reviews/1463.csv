1463,"2016-04-30",3.8,"How crazy is it to find an 8-year-old bottle of Devil Over a Barrel in the back of the beer cellar? (Bottled on 09APR08) Not a lot of pop when removing the cap (duh!) but still a respectable head when poured (though it dissipated quickly). Coffee and vanilla are both very pronounced in the aroma initially. After sitting for a bit, the aroma also has charred wood and dark chocolate. A little flat carbonation but body still has respectable weight and the texture is silky smooth. Nicely sweet over the tongue and on the finish. Will have to get a new bottle to accurately update the rating because, really, normal people arent going to let this intentionally sit for 8 years.",".08 Junction, Wisconsin, USA","mrjaxson"

1463,"2010-04-26",4.3,"Delicious beer, incredible aroma.  I would have loved to try a fresh bottle, but I have no complaints about it aged.  Appearance and feel probably have gone down hill a bit, but the aroma and flavor have the wonderful melded character that comes from age.  The beer pours black, ruby at the edges, with a very small, light brown, dissipating head.  The aroma is chock full of chocolate, coffee, sweet mild bourbon, vanilla beans, oak, wood ash and pleasant alcohol heat.  Its easily the best aroma on a porter Ive encountered and up there even amongst impy stouts.  The flavor is a bit hot but theres also lots of excellent aged malt sweetness, vanilla-y oak and a roasty bitter finish.  The mouthfeel is a tad thin, but it coats the mouth, quite pleasantly.  Wonderful.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
1463,"2010-04-26",4.5,"A-Body is a completely opaque, dark, deep brown, nearly black color. Beautiful body...but...where is the head? A tiny fizzy <1/2 finger brown head emerges for a few seconds then quickly disappears.

S-Perfect. Exactly what I would want and more in this brew. The nose is on the sweeter side but mixes roasted coffee bitterness, bourbon sweetness, with and added extra hint of vanilla and toffee to top it all off. Smells like a perfectly blended flavored coffee with a shot of bourbon in it?

T-Wonderful. The oak really comes out upfront as well as a big roasted malt background. Its actually much more bitter upfront than at the finish. The bitterness tapers off for the finish where the bourbon and vanilla oak characters really come through. A wonderfully balanced blend of roasted malt, vanilla, toffee, oak, and bourbon flavors linger and a wrapped in a soft warm alcohol blanket.

P-Good, but not as impressive as the taste and smell. Medium to high carbonation and a quite smooth medium weight body. A bit of alcohol comes through in the body.

O-The ABV in this brew is there but pretty well hidden. Overall this is a wonderfully blended beer and probably the best porter that I have ever had. I would trade for it again without hesitation. A really big thanks to EGledhill for this one!

2008 Vintage
12/12/2010:  Tyranena ""Devil Over A Barrel"" Imperial Oatmeal Porter brewed with Coffee Beans and aged in Bourbon Barrels...  Aroma:  Milky blend of mocha, vanilla, bourbon-soaked barrel char.  Pours out like used motor oil; very little carbonation; dark, murky brown color like sludgy plain coffee; off-white to beige-colored bubbles scattered on the surface.  Appearance:  Flavor:  Coffee with a splash of bourbon and hints of vanilla; soft and smooth chocolate oatmeal in the middle; faint roasty char in the thin, sweet coffee finish; bourbon pops out a bit more clearly as the beer warms; espresso-like bitterness.  Palate:  Medium-full; smooth; maybe a touch thin at times.  Overall:  Interesting flavor combination of coffee, oatmeal, and bourbon; the regular, non barrel-aged quivalent (Tyranena The Devil Made Me Do It) is better in just about every way.

Bottle : Strong roasted coffee aroma along with caramel, bourbon, and fruit.  The aromas seem to clash rather than blend together very well.  It pours a dark brown with no transparency and a small beige head.  The flavor starts with chocolate and a fruity backbone.  The finish has some watery bourbon flavors and mild roasted coffee.

1463,"2009-03-26",3.5,"12 oz bottle graciously given to me by beastiefan2k.  Pour is mostly clear black, brown with some ruby notes.  Nice one inch tan head.  Nice looking beer.  Aroma of roasted coffee maltiness, Bourbon, wood and some pine hoppiness, though that is very slight and in the background.  The nose is mostly about the coffee and Bourbon.  Taste is sharp Bourbon and wood initially, then a blast of fairly flat coffee.  Behind that is a nice roasty maltiness, some silky oatmeal, finishing with the pine bitter hops.  There is a lot of flavor in this beer, and it makes transitions between flavors well enough.  However, the coffee flavor was just a little too stale for me to love it and the Bourbon was a bit to upfront for me.  Palate is medium, slick and does not entirely cover the perceived alcohol burn from the Bourbon.  This was a well made beer, just not entirely my thing.  Thanks for giving me this one Eugene.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

1463,"2009-02-12",4.1,"Dont get me wrong, this is a good brew.  The line between porter and stout is further brewed, but I guess it really comes across in the mouth as this is thinner than I had hoped.  The bourbon is not very prominent, but does make an appearance.  If you like Peche Mortel, youll like this one.  Its basically a more coffee forward version of that.","Donora, Pennsylvania, USA","Sonicdescent"
1463,"2009-02-03",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
Bounteous coffee surrounds the caramel malts and vanilla-like bourbon notes in this lascivious and silky strong ale creation for sweet teeth.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the blackness.
-The aroma is pretty much as enticing as Péché Mortels own coffee-laden nose.
-Carbonation is relatively smooth, letting all the malts express themselves thoroughly.
-Roasted malts diversify the sweet malt profile.
-Is it me or are oatmeal and coffee often a match made in heaven in these strong dark ales?

Tyranena Brewer Gone Wild! releases have always been top notch.  This is close to the top of a competitive selection of releases.  I wish there were more people making imperial porters as I could drink them every day of the week.

Aroma / Appearance - A one finger head graced a fluid midnight black body with a sheen of lacing along the sides.  Black coffee, bitter chocolate, vanilla, oatmeal, smoke and other flavors remind me of an imperial stout just minus the plum aspect.

Flavor / Palate - Rich black coffee, vanilla, and warm alcohol crawls smoothly towards the throat.  The punch is offset by oatmeal and oak.  Thick bodied and creamy it fills the mouth.  This might be a candidate for mild aging though I dont know if I could hang on to it that long.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

I’ve really enjoyed the Brewers Gone Wild Series so far so I’ve been looking forward to this one. Devil Over a Barrel pours an impenetrable black. Not a hint of light can fight its way through. Wait, there is a touch of shoe leather brown when directly backlit but I have to look awfully hard. The head falls to a thick cap and leaves some wide, webbed lacing on its way down. Good start.

The aroma is incredible. I’ve fallen for these coffee infused beers and can’t get enough of them. With the head down to a cap deep dark chocolate keeps up with the freshly brewed coffee. Each swirl brings huge amounts of coffee, by huge I mean waking up to freshly brewed coffee huge. This stuff makes me want to dive right in. The aroma is on par with KBS.

The bourbon isn’t noticeable in the aroma but hits quickly but mildly as soon as this beer hits my tongue. Sweet roasty malts and dark chocolate combine with top quality, freshly brewed coffee. A touch of bourbon heat rolls through on the swallow. This really is an excellent beer and probably my favorite from the series.

The body is medium and grows in heft to lean toward the heavier side of the spectrum on the swallow. My only complaint, and it’s a little one, would be the body is a touch thin but then I remember I’m drinking a porter. There is a great silkiness...as this beer gets close to room temperature the mouthfeel becomes tremendous. The body got became more viscous just like I hoped for and the silky smoothness just hits the spot.

The drinkability is outstanding. I’m not sure of the abv in this beer because the alcohol is almost nonexistent but I could see this beer getting myself in trouble. I find myself taking drink after drink.

Wow! This is a great beer from the guys at Tyranena and my favorite from their lineup. One of the best coffee beers I’ve had to date. Devil Over a Barrel is an enjoyable experience to say the least. I can never wait to get my hands on the newest Brewers Gone Wild series.

Nose is a rich and robust scent similar to an Arabic/Turkish coffee or perhaps a dark black Hawaiian coffee bean. The palate is simply amazing with its refined and silky smooth texture that leaves behind a thick creamy mouth feel.  The flavor is as rich and dark of coffee as the aroma had promised and it also adds a creamy half and half taste.

The smell is rich like baked goods, so decadent and enjoyable. I get a lot of coffee, toffee, caramel, and chocolate.

Whiskey and a chocolate, nice roasted nuts and caramel in the finish. The palate is perfect for this beer: full, rich, stimulating, and balanced. Great stuff!","Austin, Texas, USA","oreogobbler"

Aroma is bourbon and coffee, with some light chocolate and caramel notes. The thickness of the oatmeal is intense, chewy and powerful. There is a huge depth of flavor. Coffee roastiness balances out the slight burn of alcohol and bourbon, with deep dark chocolate and caramel notes rounding it all out. The alcohol is a bit too present for 8%, but its very hard to find fault with this beer. Really just a phenomenal beer.","Austin, Texas, USA","slimchill"

There is a nice hint of bourbon and sweet malt characteristics to offset the bitterness of the coffee and keep the aroma nice and balanced.  Flavor is, well, mighty good!  Coffee is what the flavor is centered around, but there are heavy doses of oatmeal, sweet bourbon, caramel malts, and an overall very sweet presence...wow is this good!  Very smooth and far from overbearing on the palate, this one drinks very easily compared to many of its cousins...I think that Tyranena does a wonderful job keeping their ’heavier’ beers very, very drinkable.

The aromas of coffee and bourbon are strong on this one along with the sweetness of the oatmeal. The aroma is really nice and adds to the overall greatness of this brew 

The coffee flavor jumps right out of this brew.  It reminds me of how I used to drink my coffee in my dorm room, black with as much sugar as I could steal from the cafeteria the night before. The oatmeal helps keep this from being more espresso like by keeping the bitterness in check.
The bourbon quality is just the icing on the cake in my book nice thick mouthfeel light carbonation just enough to keep it from feeling flat

Now that is a stonking good smell. Rich dark chocolate malt, chewy oatmeal, superb vanilla and oak from the barrel and lo and behold just a faint lick of bourbon. Hooray! Once in the mouth the bourbon comes through a little more but it balances out perfectly with the sumptuous chocolate and coffee which bring with them glorious notes of proper Italian vanilla ice cream and oatmeal. A fantastic wash of earthy wood and moss really hits the spot too. Sadly the bourbon gives it a slightly raw kick of alcohol in the finish and leaves a slight hint of cardboard in the aftertaste. It also thins the palate out a little but the good width and creamy feel still qualify it for a 4. Other than the finish everything else is luscious. Well balanced and a fine piece of brewage. Yum.

1463,"2008-08-09",2.5,"A wall of deeply roasted coffee aromatics hits my nostrils as I vigorously pour this into my 25cl tulip.  The head initially forms a fat, three-finger thick, creamy, brownish, dark tan colored head.  The beer is a deep black color that shows flashes of burnt ruby if held up directly to the light.  A more focused inspection of the aroma yields more coffee; sour, burnt and charcoal like at first, but then some toasted bread notes, dark chocolate, spicy oak, a slight mustiness and ample, dusty, almost astringent, burnt grain husk aromas.  Actual Bourbon notes are hard to pick out from the aroma, but it is hard to really tell with all of the roasted grain and coffee notes here.  This has an interesting aroma, it is a bit too dominated by the coffee, which at times can make this seem a bit one-dimensional.  There is a lot going on in the aroma though, you just need to dig around for it.

Creamy tasting up front, with a rich, dark malt, light sweetness.  The finish washes the sweetness and richness out of my mouth though with its sour burnt focus, huge dark-roast coffee notes and just plain down right astringent, roasted bitterness.  The bitterness from the coffee and grain here is huge and quite unbalanced.  The finish actually makes me grimace a bit; this is mostly due to the overly roasted character, but some tannic, oak notes also contribute to the astringency of the finish.  In the middle there is actually some nice, dark chocolate flavors and maybe a touch of vanillin, but this is fleeting.  Boozy, somewhat hot, alcohol notes seem the biggest Bourbon contribution; while not overwhelming the alcohol definitely seems a bit more noticeable than I would expect from an 8% brew.  Some toasted malt notes add a bit to this brew and there is of course a huge, dark coffee flavor here.  Tastes a bit like drinking concentrated, slightly stale, long cold, black coffee, especially in the finish.

The flavors in this are huge, I can see how this is so likeable by those who like extremes, but there is just no finesse here, no real semblance of balance.  This ends up being much more of a chore to drink than it should be & I am now regretting that I chose to write about this beer instead of just cracking open a Blind Pig.  I feel really bad about it, but this beer just sucks; this is actually objectionable (especially towards the finish) and as such achieves something that is quite rare in a beer for me.  Actually if it wasnt for the harsh finish, this wouldnt be all that bad.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Flavor is quite different than I remember, also better than the severely oxidized bottle I brought with me to share in Belgium, creamy chocolate, light coffee with a oat and bourbon aftertaste, actually has turned the corner and aged nicely, the coffee is basically gone which was the most astringent part back in when I tasted this vintage in Feburary, light sour cream, watered down coffee, finishing with dark chocolate and a lasting boozy bourbon burn, but in general everything is much toned done and way smoother.

How: Bottle 12oz, thanks to the simultaneous generosity of 4 or 5 traders, you know who you are.
The look: Black body topped by a large tan head with medium retention
In long: Nose of freshly baked chocolate cake.  Body is full, as full as Ive felt for a beer of that gravity.  Taste has the usual elements of the stout/porter genre, roastiness, roasted coffee beans, cacao, dark fruits and everything.  Simply describing the flavour spectrum doesnt do this beer justice.  It is really rich in flavour and each flavour element finds its own little spot.  Rich cake mouthfeel.  Rich malted body perfectly balanced by a strong bitter finish.  But wait theres more.  A lot of hops and then some more.  The hopping has this fresh green hops flavour.  Surprising astringency in the finish.  Drink it soon as I think its fresh hopping feeling is what makes it go from an excellent stout/porter to a fantastic stout/porter.  Wow, what a kick-ass session stout/porter.  Totally satisfying.

1463,"2008-07-03",3.8,"12oz bottle from Mrthirstyneck - thanks, Shane! I’ve really been looking forward to this one, as I love coffee, dark beers, and barrel aging (yes, for a ""fad"" I’m still on board). While I confess to being mildly disappointed, I’m pretty sure my expectations were way too high. So, the positives. This is a very well balanced beer in terms of the barrel presence, with very subtle notes of wood and bourbon that don’t at all interfere with the base beer. The same holds true for the coffee, which isn’t quite as sharp and roasty as I prefer but which is nicely integrated all the same. My basic sense is that this one doesn’t have quite enough personality at the base to sustain it - Dirty Old Man and Devil Made Me Do It come across better as porters, whereas this one is a bit too top-heavy as it were. Clearly I still think it’s very good, since I’m giving it a 3.8, but it’s not quite the home run I was hoping for.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

1463,"2008-06-21",3.6,"12oz Bottle. Noses in an acidic church coffee, backed with slightly stale espresso beans coated in cheap, grainy carob-chocolate. Its not the worst coffee aroma ever, but its a harsh, acidic, slightly old and dusty and not entirely desirable. Its fresh, but in a Dunkin Donuts way, not the just fresh-roasted around the corner from top grade Peruvian stock way. Meh. Pours rather deep black-brown, with a mahogany fringe and a nicely lacing tannish head. Flavor starts from that okay coffee flavor and builds some character. The harshness of the beans still carries through and mars what I think is a decent layer of chocolate cake, oatmeal cookies, and cream. Decent malt profile signed with a strong bit of oak. A good leaf of hop comes fast on the backend for immediate balance. Im mildly perplexed by this beer. The relatively lighter bodied lets some of the fruitier coffee characters show. I dont know. Coffee for coffees sake isnt really worth it. Its got to be great coffee flavor. Im not a fan of coffee beers that use beans, theres just the wrong kind of extraction. I also find the gummier, juicier hop flavors wax over the lingering malt and barrel character in the end. A little bit of mess really. Youve got the sub-par coffee flavor starting first and riding over the top, a decent malt bill fighting for attention, barrel character searching for a home and rather out of place amount of hops muddling up the back end. This is pretty much Wisconsins tamer version of Founder Kentucky Bourbon Breakfast Stout. At least the alcohol stays tame in this one.

The coffee doesnt take over, nor does the bourbon and oakiness. A little sweet in flavor, but with a dry finish. A touch thin in the mouth. I get a kick of hops at the end, where a slight numbness/tingle from the hops sets in. This is just fantastic.

Theres really not a whole lot of actual bourbon flavor, which is completely fine by me, its just a subtle nuance instead of overpowering the Porter.  The finish reminds me of that last sip of coffee from the last cup from the pot when the filter collapses and you get a bunch of grounds that pass through, or maybe chocolate covered espresso beans.  The body is smooth and full with perfect soft carbonation and a lingering finish.  This was truly awesome, it has to be up there with my favorite coffee beers.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
1463,"2008-06-16",4.1,"12oz bottle, no date--thanks to Colin (General_Gao) for getting me this.  This fool is black with a 1/2 finger tan head that fades to a thick creamy ring and film.  Aroma is full of cold coffee and sweet caramel with some roasted malts, and a brown sugary vanilla bourbon background.  Bourbon notes are definitely stronger in the flavor, but not dominating--merely serving as a complement to the base beer.  Plenty of coffee and roasted malts are still dominating, Bone dry finish with bitterness peaking at a 2-3 and the alcohol being masked very well.  Burps coffee and sweet  bourbon.  Medium-full creamy body with light carbonation.  I loved the regular Devil, but cant really tell if I like it aged in a barrel or not.  That said, I believe this is the second barrel aged blend that Tyranena has done, and I think its the way to go as opposed to gambling with overdone and underdone barrels.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

Finishes slightly more bitter, dry and roasty with enjoyable lingering dark chocolate flavors.  Very nicely balanced, smooth and dangerously drinkable.

Freshly ground, roasted coffee beans dominate the foreground of the aroma, causing the nostrils to flare, and allowing for complimentary notes of dark cocoa and cream to be enjoyed.  Flavors include darkly roasted, nearly burnt coffee, lactose, rich chocolate, and earthy, bitter hops.  I pick up just the faintest possible bourbon note in the finish.  Roasty espresso lingers on the finish.  The mouthfeel is smooth, velvety, and moderately carbonated.  This is dangerously drinkable, and a coffee lovers dream.

The flavor followed wonderfully the aroma, excellent coffee, cocoa underneath, some roasty notes, and only a touch of vanilla / slight bourbon.

I remember this as being an awesome beer before, and when its in the barrel, it might even be better.  I typically do not jack off over barrel beers, but this may be one to crank to.

1463,"2008-06-02",3.1,"12 oz. bottle. Aroma of bourbon followed quickly by sweet coffee and mocha. Smells like actual coffee beans, not the coffee-esque smell typical of porters and stouts. Vanilla scent as well (likely from the oak). The aroma is strong, and, unlike the smell of coffee itself, it isnt disgusting, but Im not much of a fan of coffee odors in general. Pours a dark brown, almost a rich, dark amber, with a dark copper hue. Moderate amount of sable-colored head. Produces good lacing. Coffee and bourbon dominate the flavor. The taste is surprisingly sweet and sugary. Reminds me of coffee with hazelnut and grenadine added. Lemon and orange in the finish. The flavors are strong but not particularly complex. Coffee aftertaste, Medium to heavy body. Oily in the palate. At first, I found this beer surprisingly easy to drink, but it became a challenge upon multiple sips. Devil Over a Barrel is a pleasant enough brew, but its just not my kind of beer. Coffee beans simply dont belong near human palates.

Smooth caramel, coffee, malty, maybe some molasses as well.  Thick body.

The mouth feel is soft and yet somewhat refreshing due to the thinner palate of the porter and barrel aging.

First whiff is an impressively bright and green coffee aroma, along with some peppery chocolate malt, some peaty compost and gritty earthiness.  Flavor is another chapter in this story: significantly more of a chocolate syrup note, along with bourbon and some dried, charred wood.  Overall very decadent and delicious, the coffee is bright and green, which sometimes I dont like so much but I can dig it in this beer.

Theres also some chocolate that makes a presence, but the nice bourbon scent that was there in the beginning has not really come back.

Flavor is very nice, with coffee being the most prominent intially which fades in favor of well balanced bourbon.

1463,"2008-04-24",3.2,"Leaving work.  About to seek out a beer Im likely to hate.  My preconceived dismissal of anything rashly attempting to harness the subtleties of coffee through a hopeless medium or to siphon away unpleasantries through bourbon aging just seems envisioned for this one alone.  Stop myself, thinking why after all; I dont care about rocking the boat or going against the grain.  For the experience, possibly.  For the reassurance that my personal biases are in fact those that I imagine to be most correct.  For a new experience with malt, hops and yeast, and affectations.  Most of all, for the intriguing opportunuity to have those biases proven too limited and too uninformed; to have my haughtiness undercut by something that seems so much a caricature of itself and of brewing in general and to have my vision broadened.  The discovery begins with a tap pour at the Happy Gnome. 

Pours dark brown with ruby highlights and a brimming ring of tanned cream.  Aroma first brings coffee ice cream and espresso machines being cleaned.  Tart presence of dark chocolate with berry leanings and some cinnamon and vanilla impartation.  Burst of german chocolate cake warming through the closing half.  Acrid, certainly; coffee of an oxidized stripe, while bourbon settles it a bit, and plays no unfavorable part of its own.  Flavor is impish and inexpressively sweet; lots of toasted coconut and vanilla, bakers chocolate, old coffee thats taken on the character of a wet brown bag, and some healthy, juicy roastiness.  Mid palate is mostly vegetal tartness and cloying hints of burnt milk and oversugared coffee.  Texture is frothy and of a medium body, with an obnoxiously jagged base beneath a silky surface.  Throughout, the immediate tones of aroma and flavor are quite pleasant, but as the beer breathes these retreat and wither; the acridity and ugly buttery sweetness enfolding with a suffocating, grotesque force.  Altogether, the bourbon aging seems more to soften things a bit than to provide any kind of dominant flavors, which is salutary for the overall impression.  Finishes with lots of sweetened coffee, burnt caramel, and a warming, rich hint of seared rare steak that lingers quite beautifully, providing a bit of restitution there.  


Unfulfilled curiousity settles in.  An odd challenge approached with an open mind, while not fully predictable in its outcome, produced in the end a very ordinary result; this does nothing to push the boundaries or to show what possibilties there are for brewing with coffee for uniqueness or stashing in a barrel for slow sophistication or for temperance.  Admittedly, theres no reason why that should have been the point, but its certainly the reason why for me, my biases are proven justified in this case.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
1463,"2008-04-24",3.6,"12oz bottle. Aroma of under roasted cold press, green pepper, chocolate and a fairly heavy charred wood presence. Pours a dark, near opaque brown with a dense mocha head. Charred wood, bakers chocolate, cold press on the tongue. Theres a touch of steel and toasted vanilla bean. Fairly silky on the tongue. Good carbonation. The finish is a tad weak.

Smooth and lightly oily on the palate. This one glides very gently across the tongue. Quite sweet with sugared coffee, light caramel, toasted malt and hint of vanilla. Bourbon takes its time coming out in this one and only really sticks out in the vanilla and when held on the tongue for a significant period of time. Nice blend.

The flavor was also centered around heavy coffee maltage, and picked up a lovely complement of drier dark chocolate.. the edges showcased fresh coffee bitterness, fresh oak, vanilla, and light bourbon sugars.. everything came together perfectly.. long, drawn-out coffee finish with a little more of that vanilla.  Medium-plus bodied with moderate coffee bitterness throughout.. it doesnt seem like this was in the barrel for long, but the light bourbon impression worked well.

Roasted malts and that creamy slightly sweet coffee wash around the palate,and then and only then in the swallow ,the smooth traces of bourbon finishes it off.
