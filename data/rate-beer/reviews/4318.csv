Lovely fruity aroma, some apricot and peachy fleshiness even as I pour. In the glass a more woody strong ale aroma, smells serious, but not strong. Very english. Lovely rich amber, tight head, fairly persistent. Full palate, smooth from residual sugars, pleasant carbonation, feels a bit force carbonated. Taste a bit more potent than the aroma implies, lots of fruity esters, malty with quite a bit of woodiness, some almond, some alcohol. Finishes with the almond becoming more cherry-like, and dang - it does become cherry bakewell tart eventually. Gently warming, but not boozy.

I look forward to the new version each year (and sometimes distribution makes me wait for 2 years), and it is so nice to have it in a reasonably fresh state. As time passes, its making me think of white grapes turned into, dare I say it? I dare. It really begins to suggest a solera woodiness and maybe even brandy. And now I can parse out some heat.

Pours clear orange to chestnut brown with almost no head. Nose is the usual rich caraml, toffee, earthy hop, wet leaves, barley sugar, slight leather, but theres a new world hop in there which is adding lychee, bubblegum, herbal and berry fruits. On the taste theres quite a lot of tropical fruit mixing with berry fruit, caramel, toffee, barley sugar, ripe fruit, dried apricot. Its quite hard so itll be interesting to see how this might soften with age. This is definitely the most interesting version of this Ive tasted.

4318,"2016-11-27",3.9,"500ml Bottle #78106 from LCBO. Yup, seems Im still rating. As always with FVA, a gorgeous pour - bright and clear ruby-amber with a decent straw-coloured fizzy/foamy head. The usual biscuit and ""red"" fruit aroma, with no sourness and more sharp floral and somewhat funky bitterness - very appealing. Taste follows, a little sourness creeping in but I swear its just the lush UK hops in the mix riding over top of everything else - and as always definitely alcohol presence. Fairly light body, but not watery - good an lively with some astringency - finishes about medium - plenty of bitterness, but it doesnt assault the palate and hang on grimly - surprisingly drinkable for such a moderately big brew ... I think I will go get more of these - not sure they will age well at all, but fresh they are very pleasant.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
