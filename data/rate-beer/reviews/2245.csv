Bit sugary sweetness in onset, aromatic herbs (star aniseed?), smooth and somewhat thin mouthfeel, light acidity, subtle lambic character, clearly diluted by a normal beer, light bitterness in the end.

pours clear copper, very small foam ( more like a layer on the beer than a foam) and a weakened faro-smell. taste is not TOO bad. i still can taste the bad aspects of the firardin faro ( the harshness drinkability, sourness in a bad way.. if anyone understands dutch  -- een wrange smaak-- (however you say that in english) but the good sides of it come more forward. like in any faro so far i have a very specific , aplle-all-over taste ( that seems to be onley with me, while its so straight that.. weird) that i like and that comes better to the front in this one. 
also is more drinkable.

i would say this is a better version of their faro ( becouse its weeker in taste) but it doesnt get close to the other i drank ( lindemans and straffe winter).. im gonna try to finish a whole bottle of this, wish me luck !","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"

Aroma of cherries, apples, caramel and madeira wine as well. Hardly any bitterness, but some some acidity and sweetness. Moderate and tolerable sweetness at first, that becomes stronger with time and is  an important part of the aftertaste. I guess thats what the sucralose does, that can be found on the list of ingredients. I would have preferred a tart and drier finish, but then it probably would not pass as a Faro. I was still pleasantly surprised by this beer, that to me tastes like a mixture of oud bruin and lambic. I dont get the pilsener part, though - is that really in the mix?

2245,"2012-01-18",3.8,"In short: A slightly sweet acidic lambic with an unexpected red-fruits flavor.  Very original
How: Bottle 750ml.  Exact age unknown
The look: Slightly cloudy light-copper body topped by a small beige head
In long: Nose is musty, rustic, a bit funky and with a good amount of unexpected red fruits.  This is supposed to be a faro (according to ratebeer current style) so I was really surprised by the color and aromas.  Taste has a little sweetness but it is a lot less sweet than what I expect from a faro.  The sweetness felt like red fruits sweetness.  In a blind tasting I would have sworn this was a fruit-lambic with an unusual fruit (some exotic red fruit of some kind).  The beer ends with a sharp acidic tartness that is a bit reminiscent of raspberry pits.  Acidity level is pretty much the same as a regular fruit Lambic but there is no almost no sourness.  This was a strange beast for sure and drinking a full bottle was actually quite easy (compared to most lambics).  I think this beer is both underrated and probably wrongly classified as a Faro (which could explain the underrated part).  Thats my opinion and unless someone tells me the things I write in my ratings dont make any sense I will continue macerating spongy clocks in the noisy lights of the coral reef.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2245,"2010-07-25",3.4,"2010 on the cork; sampled July 2010
A soft pour produces a two-finger thick, lightly tan tinged head.  The beer is a dark, burnt amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, brown honey color when held up to the light.  The aroma smells like caramelized fruit, a mix of pear and apple really, as well as a touch of sweet-tea notes, some anchoring tartness as well as some dark grain cracker like notes in the finish if you really dig around for a while.  A touch of urea ties in the Lambic origin as do some faint musty and even mushroom like earthy notes.  It almost seems to have a sugary smokiness to it at times, though this is quite fleeting.

Because fairly warm the beer is not overwhelmingly sweet; it does have a sweetness though, and one that lingers in the finish with a fruity, caramelized candi sugar note.  Lightly tart up front and it has a zippy carbonation that makes it a bit carbonic, all of these help to balance the candi-sugar flavors.  Fruity flavors of candied pears, perhaps a touch of sweetened lemon (more like crystal light than actual lemons though) and perhaps a tart berry like flavor are all accentuated by the sweetness.

Not a bad Faro, it could use some more funkiness, as it is completely devoid of this character in the flavor.  The sweetness is not too overwhelming here and I could almost see myself drinking this again, though it doesnt hold a candle to the 3 Fonteinen Faro.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2245,"2009-11-13",3.1,"Slighly hazy yellowish orange color with small red hues. A rather big off-white head that actually stays around for quite a while (not very common when it comes to lambics) and leaves nice lacings.

The smell is refreshing and pleasant with quite a lot of sweet fruit aromas (tangerines and peaches) that reside on and suppress some rustic aromas of hay, yeast and malts. Hints of fudge and caramel. The classic lambic character in this one is light and mellow, but its noticeable.

The taste is mild and easy-going. The malty backbone is quite prominent with plenty of flavors of fudge and caramel. Some semi-sweet fruit aromas. Hints of grass, yeast and hay, and perhaps a minimal note of oak barrel. The finish has a mild lemony tartness to it and this helps to balance the otherwise rather sweet taste. The finish is short and one-sided with a light maltiness and some fruit.

Moderate body. Slightly stickier than expected and the finish lacks the dryness of most lambics.

Im not sure about this one. Its tasty and easy to drink, but its a bit restrained and uninteresting. Its a bit on the sweet side and has quite an unusual composition of flavors (lots of malts and caramel) considering that its a lambic. I would have liked more character and en edgier profile with less sweetness.
