Barva samotného piva je jiskrně měděná. Chuť je výrazná, karamelová s nádechem přezrálého ovoce, fini je výrazně hořký a drící. V ústech pivo působí plně, má střední říz a je dobře pitelné. Jedná se o zajímavý ale který bych svou chutí zařadil spíe do stylu bitter.","Hostivice, CZECH REPUBLIC","Jamedra"

1919,"2013-01-30",3.8,"Bottle from Maria, Kraków. In short, this beer has an English feel with an American punch. Pronounced caramelly malty base, apple esters, citrusy and floral hops. Quite a full body, the maltiness is apparent and very pleasant. Strong bitterness with resiny and citrusy notes, although some earthy hints are also present, meaning there could also be some English hops in there. Creamy mouthfeel. Would be even better if it wasnt slightly oxidised. A great crossover ale!","Mikołów, POLAND","ElDesmadre"

1919,"2012-09-26",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2014 Colour hazy darker amber. Small off-white head. Aroma unexpected fruity, almost no hops. Later floral hops aroma. Taste light heavy hoppy bitter, medium malty sweet. Finish muddy grassy medium bitter. 6 4 7 4 14 Rerate at RJ. Aroma mostly hoppy, with light malty background. I get fruits, undiscernable. Almost all of them, in a good way. Taste is initially balanced. Moderate bitterness. Gets more bitter towards finish, maltiness vanishes, leaving fruity hoppy aftertaste. One of the better czech ales, hops being overally fruit-forward.","Bratislava, SLOVAK REPUBLIC","Gurthnar"
