3490,"2015-11-09",3.5,"12 oz tulip draft at the brewpub in Portland, Oregon. The pour is a hazed golden yellow with a small white head. The aroma is light grass hop along with a bit of cracker malt. The taste is the cracker malt up front, thinner, with grass soft citrus behind. The palate is light bodied with soft carbonation and a clean dry finish. Crisp easy drinking. Glad I could try.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

3490,"2013-02-25",3.5,"Draft @ HOTD. Pours a hazy, orange-copper color with a modest off-white head. Refreshing, lightly piney and herbaceous aroma; hop-forward in the nose, with a hint of crystalline sugar. Nose follows suit: a lean, piney, and reasonably bitter pale-ish ale with a lightly coarse core; hints of candy sugar and a lingering, dry, crackly toastiness emergent and lingering in the finish. A touch rough, but plenty of enjoyable piney bitterness.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

3490,"2012-12-29",3.6,"Served in a tulip glass. Half finger of head on a cloudy, medium straw colored body.
It smells like wet grain and hay, in the best possible way.
The taste is nice: wet grain and mild bitterness.
Fizzy texture with moderate carbonation and medium body.
Pretty good flavor and drinkable.","Corbett, Oregon, USA","Fatehunter"
3490,"2012-12-06",3.6,"A hazed amber ale with a thin lacing off white head. In aroma, nice grainy malt with nice herbal British hops, lightly floral. In mouth, a nice roasted malt with light treacle, grassy and lightly piney hops, very nice and pleasant. On tap at brewery, Oct. 7 2012.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
3490,"2012-12-02",4.0,"hazy tan, small bubbled white head, large ring remains. Deceptively  complex nose is sweet tangerine and honey, bit dusty. Bready flavor, crusty with light dough front, merging to grass and light pine mid, lightly resinous. Awesome, dry profile. Expected more flavor, but supremely balanced and delicate, controlled.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
3490,"2012-12-01",3.7,"On tap at the brewpub in Portland, OR. Pours a cloudy, deeper golden-orange colored body with an inch thick, dense and frothy, off-white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is grassy and piney grapefruits with some floral citruses and a lightly sweetened, biscuity caramel malt sweetness. Flavor is bready malts with a grassy citrus. A few straw melon notes, light pines and florals, and a touch of toasty caramel. Finishes dry and moderately bitter with a bit of a toasted, bready sweetness. Lengthy aftertaste following a light body and a medium, crisp carbonation. Overall, a pretty damn good mild ale. Well hopped, enough of a malt presence, dry, and very easy drinking. Good one.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
3490,"2012-11-24",4.1,"Growler thanks to brainlair. Pours low haze orange with a thick creamy head. Weaker retention. Nose is grassy and herbal hops, toffee, fresh honey biscuit, butterscotch, caramel chews. Taste is extremely soft, nicely hopped and bitter.  Toffee, fresh bread, pizza crust. Soft dough in the background.  Insanely soft palate. A masterpiece in malt extraction and liberal hopping. A Ryan Artuso beer x1000. Perhaps a Michael James beer as well.

3490,"2012-11-24",3.8,"Growler courtesy of BrainLair.  Pours a hazy pale brown with a thick fluffy light tan head.  Hoppy aroma - lots of pine and and herb.  A slight note of toasted nutty malt behind the hops. Flavor is dry with toasted malts.  Notes of nuts, rye bread, and chocolate.  Nice bitter hoppiness on the finish.   Grassy and a bit piny.  Really smooth and easy to drink.","Seattle, Washington, USA","EricE"

Flavor of honey, melon, pale and sweet malts, straw, grass, and herbs. Light-bodied, with medium, deceptively sharp, carbonation and a crisp mouthfeel. Excellent session ale.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3490,"2011-12-29",3.3,"Tap at HOTD.  Pours to a super hazy darky chestnut colored body with a gorgeously laced white head.  The aroma is hoppy with a big grassy component.  The flavor is more toasty malts with grassy hops.  Doesnt have that big alcoholic kick like most beer.  The palate is light bodied but still substantial.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
3490,"2011-12-16",3.1,"Turbid brown/orange appearance. Thin and wispy head. Darker than the ""bitters"" Im used to drinking. Strong orange citrus aroma. Its quite pungent. Touch of caramel malt. Im not sold on the aroma. A very odd malt flavor lingers, and it attempts to meld with the Sharp citrus flavor. Seems to be more grapefruit on the tongue, and orange on the nose. Not really a good representation of the ""Little Dog"" series.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"
3490,"2011-12-16",4.4,"Turbid orange pour - thick, soapy lace - nose of minerals, leafy, floral hops, Biscuity malt, caramel - flavor is very hefty and rich for the abv - rolled oats, caramel richness despite the crisp, crackery maltiness - earthy hop flavor - floral and peppery bitterness - simple but complex and goddamned awesome.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
3490,"2011-11-18",3.4,"On tap at the brewery. Pours a cloudy orange/brown, with a small white head. Aroma of piney hops, citrus fruits - very much like an IPA, caramel. Flavour of bitter citrus fruits, orange peel and hops. A dry and bitter beer. Very fresh tasting.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Matts_Property"
3490,"2011-11-13",3.3,"On tap at Hair of the Dog, split with Matts_Property, pours a hazy dark golden orange with a medium off-white head. Aroma of bitter hops, caramel, sort of like an IPA. Flavour is very dry, with somewhat bitter hops, roasted / burnt bread, sort of an English quality with American hops. Very well-made for the style.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
3490,"2011-10-29",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 8, 2011 draft at the brewery, fall 2011 batch. unfiltered and cloudy orange body with an off-white patchy bubbled head. bright, prickly high-acid dry hopped nose, its astoundingly fresh, grassy and green without any excessive resinous / oil from the cones.  this is hop soup, yup. comes across similar to the first batch of Little Dog Fred, with its bright, snappy, zesty and prickly hop acids, but its fuller-bodied with stronger esters.  of course its impossible to make a comparison to Doggie Claws as it lacks the sweet / sugary / waxy / soap ester character and obviously is nowhere near as full-bodied and chewy. yeast is doughy and english in nature, i think this is what really ties it all together and propels this beer (and the first LD Fred batch) to mid-to-upper 4 levels. i had to bring in a small pour of the current LD Fred batch to compare, and yes, the Fred version as it is now isnt as bright, fresh, grassy and vibrant as the Doggie Claws, and is a shadow of what i found back in January.  but this release, this is it once again. incredible and vibrant hop flavor; toasted / cracked pale malt; rustic yeast; strongly bitter without reaching what id call astringent.  back end is entirely dry, body is light, pillowy and firm and does not at all seem like its under 4%.   a stunning achievement.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3490,"2011-10-09",3.9,"Draft at the pub.  This was described as a dry, hoppy amber which about sums it up. Cloudy.  Aroma shows nice floral hops, recognizable as HotD with the traditional house character to back it up.  Taste is super dry with a nice hop flavor and quick finish.  Certainly unrecognizable from Doggie Claws with no sweetness or alcohol.  Super drinkable.  This is one of the best versions of Little Dog.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"
3490,"2011-03-28",4.0,"First off if its a little dog it has paws, end rant.   Growler pours  a golden body with a white head.  Very herbal, nice grass tones, tropical fruit flavors.  Citrus a bit sweet grass, and light herbs.  Sure the body is thin but dang i couldnt stop sucking down the growler.  Really quaffable for sure.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
3490,"2011-03-22",3.3,"Gathering at Pauls house.  Ive always wanted to try a ""small"" beer, made with the leftover  mash from another ""big"" beer.  The aroma is fruity, floral hops.  The appearance is a clear gold color, small white head.  The flavor is like the aroma.  The finish is floral hops.  Thin/medium in body.  Decent, interesting.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"
3490,"2011-03-06",3.5,"Growler at the double 5k tasting courtesy of Trevor.  Pours a clear gold with just the faintest touches of haze.  Floral on the nose, light grainy sweetness and citrus.

3490,"2011-02-26",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2016 Growler shared by someone at Paul and Ryans 5000 celebration, thanks! Poured a hazy orange amber with a white head that dissipated slowly to the edges. Aroma was full of tropical fruit, citrus, flora and a bit of backing bitter grapefruit. Flavor began with citrus and a bit of tropical fruit and became more bitter as grapefruit grew. There was a bit of a grain backbone. Nice!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
3490,"2011-02-25",3.6,"Lightly sweet, cracker malt nose. Taste is lightly sweet, lightly bitter, light honey and dough, some herbal hops. Rather nice.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"
3490,"2011-02-12",3.8,"Tap @ Hair of the Dog...  This small beer from Doggie Claws poured vibrant, hazy golden/yellow with a white head.  Floral hops on the nose with a biscuity grain character.  Cascade hops maybe?  Very floral, earthy, aromatic, piney.  Cracker-like, toasted grains.  Smooth drinking, great hop presence.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
