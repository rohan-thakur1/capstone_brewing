Pours the deepest darkest brown into black with a short-lived, fizzy large bubbled brown head that settles to a ring and leaves a couple spots of lace.

Aroma is rich, sweet cherry juice meets bourbon-soaked oak chips. Lots of cherry, bourbon, roasted malt, mild vanilla. Sweet, faintly tart, a little syrupy, and very decadent. The taste includes plenty of sweet cherry juice over a background of warming bourbon, oak, and light tannins. Some prunes come alongside the cherries with a very light tartness. Vanilla, oak, dark cocoa, and some molasses come to play as well. Never gets too sweet, too tart, or too hot. Good barrel and fruit meshing with the stout flavors...

453,"2012-09-25",3.0,"12 oz. bottle of unknown age (probably a few years old), generously bonusd by northernbrews (thanks a lot, Jeff). Pours black with a reddish tinge and a small beige head. Aroma brings out the cherry on top, boozified by the bourbon barrels, with notes of oak and liqueur - basically like a sweet cherry liqueur. Flavour is a fair bit tart due to the cherries, with some mild bourbon coming through, but is almost completely outdone by the tart cherry juice. There is no booze to be detected - perhaps age has concealed it. Medium-bodied, with the tartness becoming more and more prominent with each successive sip. Not sure a whole 12 oz. bottle of this is warranted for one person drinking it - wouldve rather split it. Anyway, not really my type of stout due to the sourness (not a good combination to me).","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

Batch 7777.

The beer is a deep, dark brown with minimal head. The aroma brings a lot of barrel characteristics, with a subtle fruitiness from the cherries. The flavor is excellent, and right away I am impressed with the balance of the beer and cohesiveness of all the flavors. The cherries are not incredibly forward, though they are present. Instead, they play a supporting role and meld beautifully into the overall profile. The feel is smooth, with alcohol content quite subdued, likely do to four years of aging. Plenty of good carbonation still exists. Overall, a really tasty brew. I definitely recommend it.

But although the distinct flavors are clearly present, the beer is nicely balanced and each sip surprises again. The cherry is not overdone, and gives the heavy bourbon BA RIS a sweet and fruity edge, but also in some way makes it refreshing and more easy drinkable (which can be a killer combo though).

Medium-bodied with more carbonation than I remember from the regular Cherry Stout and a boozy vanilla finish.  I enjoyed the cherry stout a lot, and thought the tartness and roastiness balanced well.

The cherries and light carbonation give it an interesting mouthfeel.  The initial flavor is of soft wood and chocolate.  It isnt until the aftertase that the cherries and coffee accents really push through.  Very complex flavor.

They are a bit more subdued here and have more chocolate overtones. Its fairly sweet with lots of malt, but its balanced out by some woody flavour and a bit of roast. Cherry is there, again subdued. Its really much better balanced than the regular version but I still feel like the cherry ruins the stout a bit.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"

453,"2009-07-28",4.1,"I wasnt a huge fan of the Cherry Stout beer to begin with, as I thought it lacked any cherry character to begin with.  This beer followed the same thing, except now its got a huge bourbon character in both the aroma and flavor which bumps it up a few levels.

The beer pours out an inky black color, coating my glass with a molasses-like color and a 1"" creamy brown head.  Aroma is clearly bourbon dominant, with lots of wood, toffee, light smoke, vanilla and dark chocolate.  Flavor is full-on bourbon like someone poured a quick shot in my bottle.  Oak flavors, vanilla, tart malt/fruit (although I couldnt get cherry, but could see the association of tartness with the cherries), Red Vines and a bit of tobacco.  Very enjoyable beer and erases the memory of the Cherry Stout from my mind.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"
453,"2009-07-27",4.1,"12oz bottle courtesy of armchairboogie poured into a tulip.

Pours opaque black in the glass with a big bubbly mocha head that dissipates pretty quickly to a solid ring and leaves only patchy lacing.

The aroma is basically bourbon-soaked cherries dipped in chocolate.  The cherries are slightly tart with lots of dark chocolate sweetness.  The bourbon is not overpowering but definitely present.

The taste starts out with a big blast of tart and sweet cherries.  Its definitely got more of a sour kick than the aroma.  The backbone is sweet, dark roasted malts.  Theres only a hint of bourbon in the finish and the taste is definitely bigger on cherries than the aroma.

The mouthfeel is slick and medium to full-bodied with a soft carbonation that leaves the palate sticky with cherry sweetness with a hint of puckering tartness, though just a touch.

This is a very nice cherry stout that has plenty of body and stout character, but its the cherries that really make the taste stand out.  Another great stout from Bells.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Taste is strong bourbon, too, along with tart fruits, roasted malt, oak, and vanilla. Thick bodied and chewy with more tartness from the cherries.

Ive never had a bourbon barreled beer from Bells, but they appear to do them quite well. This beer, however was an absolute mess. Aroma of molasses, rotting wood, plenty of soy, alcohol, a bit of charred malt, wet, rotting wood, musty cherry juice... ugh. Pours a thick, impenetrable dark brown with a creamy and quickly dissolving dark khaki head. Flavor is just as messy as the aroma. Boozy cherry liqueur, assloads of offputting wood tannin, charred malt, vanilla extract.  A bit of bitter chocolate, more molasses, soy sauce, fusel alcohol. Palate entry is initially rather thick and relatively creamy but by the finish the beer becomes watery and totally boozy. Finishes with a very brash tannic wood note and plenty of alcohol hotness.

Flavor, however, made up for that with a deep rich malt character, roasted malts, and cherry in the background.  I had this put up next to the original cherry and the cherry in this one was a bit more hidden due to the high alcohol content and the flavors associated with it.

A large tart nose thats quickly robbed by a burning bourbon.  Pours very black with minimal head.  When fresh, its almost a bourbon stout with a hint of cherry, and when aged, its a muddle of cherry and smokey bourbon.  I think i prefer it fresh so the flavors dont overlap and get in the way of each other.  The bourbon barrel used is a unique flavor and smell.  Palate is cream and thick.

453,"2009-03-05",3.7,"Bottle, batch 7777. Aroma quite buttery and woody with sweet notes from the bourbon, almost candied sugar-like. Flavor contrasts the sweet bourbon notes with the tart cherry notes, with the butter/wood taking more of a back seat. I thought the tartness of the cherry was far too prominent in the regular cherry stout, and the bourbon and wood were nice compliments. However, by the end of the glass, the tartness was really starting build, not quite to the point of sour milk as I found in the regular, but still overriding the balancing components. Certainly an improvement for me though.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"

Cherry liquor aromas do not scream bourbon and neither to the flavors, which are featuring solid black cherry goodness more than wood or bourbon. Liked it a lot.

Nose is intense cherry with some woody smoky notes, the complexity in the flavor is slightly lacking in the taste. Taste is like Raspberry Eisbock levels of amazing decadence. Chocolate covered cherries, little to no carbonation though there is a little natural carb, but its just perfect for what feels like the ultimate desert beer. I had 3 pours of this, everyone who tried it instantly fell in love with it that I saw and it really became better and more complex with each sip.

453,"2009-01-24",3.1,"At the pub and then from a bottle and there was a consensus. I cannot understand how this is so popular while to me, this brewery produces at least two dozens more interesting brews. The pitch black pour with its medium tan head does not generate that evocative a smells. The balance immediately leans toward the name of the product, cherries and bourbon and the result provides lots of fruity acidity that more or less fits the roastiness. Pleasant smokiness if the finish does not quite catch up as the heavy fruitiness makes it feels awkward and juicy. Never clashing, but with every sip, it makes me wonder why I dont step over to change the content of my glass.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

453,"2008-12-27",4.2,"Bottle from personal stash- last years batch. Pours thick, dark, reddish/brown, with a light reddish/brown head that is foamy but discipates quickly, leaving a small ring and light, intermittent lace. Nose is of vanilla, a little caramel, and a lot of sweet, red wine/cherries. The initial taste is moderately astringent and tangy with the wine/cherry, and semi-sweet chocolate following. The alcohol, as soft bourbon, is present and warming behind the above, bolder flavors. Nice stout variation for some quality sitting and sipping.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

Initial taste of cherry, bourbon overlaying a syrupy vanilla and mollasses. Mid palate becomes slightly vinous with touches of cocoa. Finishing with good palate duration of alcohol warmth and bourbon. The rich sweet malt is some what shocking to the palate at first, but as you the sip further into this brew it becomes quite intriguing.","Norwood, Massachusetts, USA","Alldaydrinker"

453,"2008-11-30",2.6,"UPDATED: FEB 13, 2009 In short: Bourbon Barrels, sweet cherries and stout clash with each other more than they work together.   A bad idea.
How: Bottle 12oz, consumed when about 4 months old.  From CharlesDarwin, thanks a lot buddy.
The look: Black body topped by a very small tan head
In long: Light-medium roastiness level.  Taste of concentrate cherry juice, some other red fruits, black liquorice and a whole lot of bourbon barrels.  Vanilla and more vanilla, the barrels here contributed way too much vanilla.  Syrupy limy body.  No hops presence.  This beer is what it says it is, bourbon barrels and cherry stout.  Cherry character is really sweet maraschino cherries and not fresh tart cherries and that doesnt work with the bourbon barrel at all.  Tonight I had my only two Bourbon Barrel Cherry Stouts (this one and the Central Waters) and while not the total mess that was the Central Waters this beer was less than convincing.  I now believe that Bourbon Barrels, Cherries and Stout are three elements that blend together as well as bananas, ketchup and maple syrup.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
453,"2008-11-20",4.1,"Courtesy of CharlesDarwin, thanks buddy, this was a special treat. Pours deep darkness with dark mocha to brown head. The aroma starts with mild bourbon that moves toward smooth oak, hints of roasty malts, faint alcohol heat and some dark ripe cherries riding around in the background (causing trouble, no doubt). The taste hits all at once with an array of notes of malty goodness, roasted malts and bourbon and then followed by sweet ripe cherries, chocolate, molasses and vanilla. This is just plain yummy.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
453,"2008-11-16",3.2,"My Bottom Line:
Anisey bourbon is emboldened by vinous cherries, as fruity tartness, chocolate and caramel attempt to coexist. This rich creation is the home for many voluble flavors, but I fear I do not see them as being as harmonious and pleasant as most here.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam crowns the velvety black.
-Although there are a few crunchy biscuity notes, most of the flavors are expressed in the sweet realm of things.
-The body is as voluptuous as most of Bell’s big beers.
-The finish isnt too long, but that makes the beer much more drinkable.
-Alcohol hits quite seriously midway.
-The sequence of flavors is just bizarre to my tastes, although I admit I thought bourbon and cherries would work better together. My loss, I guess.

453,"2008-10-31",3.9,"Bottle, once more, with thanks from nbutler11.  Smells great: thick sweet bourbon, vanilla-caramel, chocolate-covered cherries.  The flavor is more subdued than the un-aged version.  By that I mean that while the bourbon overlaps with both the cherry and stout elements, it enhances neither.  While it may not eliminate both (and my first instinct was to say so), it certainly competes with both, often to the point of interference.  But fattie cheers on a unique brew.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"

Flavors follow suit, hot from the bourbon, with a huge, bittersweet chocolate profile and semi-sour cherries.  On the finish, sour heat coats the tongue and stays there for a good while.  The body is thick and viscous, but gets to be cloying pretty quickly, coating the mouth in sugar.  The various elements just aren’t sitting right with me.

Pours dark brown with a small beige head. Nose has huge vanilla/butterscotch element with strong alcohol, chocolate, and minor cherry or in other words, this smells like bad memories of Cuervo Gold, and cheap tequila is probably my least favorite  drink. Summoning all my courage, I get big alcohol in the taste, more cherries, and less of that cloying vanilla/butterscotch terror. At room temp, ""the horror. the horror"" fades a little more, and the taste actually becomes coordinated,  though the aftertaste is still painful. Even if I subjectively hate cheap tequila and should disregard that, I still dont like BBBACS much.

The taste was more of the same, chocolate covered sweet cherries with a moderate boozy and tannic background. What bitterness is found is the results of a espresso like astringent nature than hops.

I must say for some time I couldnt get over that butterscotch, its in the flavor too. After a bit I noticed more cherries, a sweet chocolate finish and a smooth rich body.

453,"2008-07-17",4.1,"Bottle sampled at sliffy’s and again at mgumby10’s - thanks guys:  The aroma of this beer reminds me of cartoons, where there is a pie in the window and the tantalizing, animated steam coming off of that pie wafts into the nose of an unsuspecting passerby and it blissfully lifts him off of the ground and he floats, salivating, through the air toward said pie in the anticipation that the olfactory deliciousness of the aroma could hope to match the taste of it.  That kind of sums up this beer for me.  If you could capture the aroma of this beer into an extract, it would be the best-selling candle at Bob Evans.  Tart and sweet cherry pie filling, perfectly spiced with just the right amount of warm vanilla wafts on top of lightly bourbon-soaked oak.  It smells at first like pie, then like icing.  The flavor is just as complex, with dark malts swirling with vanilla, tart cherry, and light bourbon.  Dry character.  A very interesting blend that far surpasses the plain Cherry Stout.","I F&ckin hate those guys from, Ohio, USA","Rogueone"

453,"2008-07-14",3.6,"From a 12oz Bottle, Batch #7777.  Bottle courtesy of CharlesDarwin.  Dark black, chalky opaque colored pour, edged in ruby, topped with a creamy finger of tan foam.  A butterscotch diacetyl aroma jumps out in the nose right away, but after the initial negative impression, it starts to fade into the background.  Doughy, pretzely bourbon notes accompany tart black cherry skins and some dry dark chocolate.  Lots of cherry in the nose, along with some harsher higher alcohols.  Medium full bodied, creamy carbonated mouthfeel with a slick, velvety texture.  The diacteyl, while still present, seems to be much more restrained in the flavors, leading to a more enjoyable drinking experience.  Rich mid-malt flavors of toffee and caramel up front on the palate, along with some lighter vanilla barrel notes.  Chewy fudge and hints of plum come out mid-palate.  The cherry comes out strong on the back end, along with bourbon soaked caramel flavors.  The combination of bourbon and cherry seemed a little strange to my palate at first, but I really warmed up to the flavor combination as I sipped this beer.  Both bold traits seem to be well balanced and work well together.  Unfortunately for me, the diacetyl was a major detractor, but I would imagine another clean batch of this would be simply stellar.  It seems very uncharacteristic of Bells (at least in my tasting experience) to sell a beer with an obvious flaw, especially one that was likely present before the beer even went into the barrel.  Nonetheless, I really hope this beer gets brewed again, as I can imagine batch 2 being a real treat.  Thanks a ton, Tom!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

A- Pours a deep brown, almost black with a small, brown head which fades quickly.

S- Smell is extremely enticing. A candied cherry scent with some bourbon on the back end. Like no other beer I have ever smelled.

T- Taste is a sublime mix between a deep, sweet stout character (chocolate, roasted malt, smooth sweetness) and a strong cherry characteristic. The cherry rides on top of the flavor but doesnt overpower the stout and then transitions seamlessly into hints of bourbon on the back end.

M- Medium bodied, quite a bit of carbonation.

D- This is not only extremely drinkable but very interesting. There is a barrage of flavors without having an extremely high alcohol content. Bells should start producing this on a bigger scale. By far the best beer ive ever tasted from this brewery.","California, USA","Lothore"

Pours dark black with a short lived tan head.  Smell is dark cherry, bourbon, oak, and extremely buttery, and perhaps butterschotch like.  Really nice at first until the buttery element really started to become a bit offputting.  Taste is as advertised with cherry, light roastiness as well, chocolate and some oak and bourbon with no real alcohol flavor or burn.  Much better than the regular cherry stout to me, but still a bit too buttery in the flavor.  Rating went from 4.3 to 3.9 from the 1st half to 2nd half of the bottle from that.

453,"2008-06-20",4.2,"Bottle picked up at the Bells General Store.  Black pour with slight crimson edging.  Two finger tan head that quickly vanishes into a bubbling cascade of lace.  Appears to have lots of carbonation.  Cherries, dark fruit, vanilla, and some earthiness in the aroma.  Some oak pressence as well.  Wow, awesome flavor.  Bourbon shows up but does not overpower.  Cherry provides both sweet and sourness that nicely balances the beer.  Now that Im getting into it some chocolate is showing itself.  Medium/full mouthfeel, a treat for the palate.  Warming finish.  Great beer!","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hopslovin"
453,"2008-06-20",4.2,"12oz bottle from cpferris - thanks, Chad! What a pure delight to try this one, a feather in Bells already distinguished cap. The cherry stout has never been my absolute favorite, but to say this one is on a different level is a pretty fair understatement. A nice thick pour with a crisp head and a massive butterscotch aroma. I fell in love before the first sip. The cherrys there when you start to taste it, very dry and well integrated into the whole, with woody notes present, along with smooth chocolate. Top notch.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
453,"2008-06-20",4.2,"Many thanks to JCB for sharing this one. Thanks Jason! Pours a dark black allowing no light in the pour. Has a thin dark tan head. The nose is very pungent. Jason put his finger on it with butterscotch, sweet, light alcohol, chocolate, woody, oaky vanilla, light cherry skins. The flavor is very rich, chocolate, warm alcohol, butterscotch, cherry skins, the oak and bourbon are fun to pick out and become evident with repeat sipping. The palate is creamy and smooth with little carbonation. Finishes warm with oak flavors. Fantastic stout.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
453,"2008-06-19",3.9,"Bottle shared by Crosling, thanks Nick.  Pours opaque with an average, fizzy, dark brown head, lasting with good lacing.  Aroma is heavy malt (coffee, toasted, burnt, nutty), average hops (grass), heavy yeast (sweat, leather, cheese, musty) with notes of cherry, light alcohol, wood, and soy sauce.  Full bodied, creamy texture, soft carbonation, and a bitter finish.  Long duration, light sweetness, moderate acidity and bitterness.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
453,"2008-06-19",4.1,"12oz. bottle, with much appreciation to cpferris for the hookup!  Pours a thick dark brown with a foamy brown two finger head. minimal lacing.  Aroma is chocolate covered cherry, vanilla, and light charred oak and bourbon.  Flavor is more chocolate covered cherry, vanilla and light roast, with a nice lingering tartness mingled with a subtle oaky bourbon finish.  This sure worked for me, and found the bourbon barrel to compliment well.  Thanks again Chad!","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"
453,"2008-06-18",4.1,"Pours dark brown, with a brown head. Aroma is bourbon, cherries, chocolate, and vanilla.  Flavor is bourbon, cherries, chocolate, malt, vanilla and alcohol.

453,"2008-06-18",2.5,"Bottle shared by Pud, thanks Dave.   Pours nearly black with the slightest of red tones, tan colored head.   Aroma is oak, bourbon, vanilla, almond, tart cherries, the nose is the only redeeming characteristic.   Flavor is ALL bourbon, slightest hint of roast, light oak, I really gotta work hard to find the cherries.   Palate is full bodied, light carbonation, finished HOT, really HOT!   I found this to be quite horrid.   I cant understand all the high ratings for something so horribly unbalanced.   The original beer, the cherry stout, is not even distinguishable in this offering.   Total miss, nearly undrinkable as it warms.   I hate to totally slam a beer graciouosly shared by a friend, but this SUCKED!   Cant wait til Moejuck get hold of this one!","Ohio, USA","ogglethorp"
453,"2008-06-16",4.1,"Pours a wicked dark reddish-brown with a small tan head that struggles for survival.  The cherry cordial aroma found in Bells standard Cherry Stout is made more complex by the sweet bourbon and woody notes.  Phenomenally tasty - the flavor is much more complex and integrated than that of the off-the-shelf Cherry Stout.  Bourbon flavors become more pronounced as it warms up.  Most of the shortcomings of the standard CS are improved by barrel aging, but still could stand a little bit more body.","Williamston, Michigan, USA","sleestak"
453,"2008-06-15",4.2,"Bottle shared by Crosling.  Poured a deep ruby-brown color with a thin beige head that diminished to a ring.  Aroma of charred oak, bourbon, chocolate malt, and some moderately tart cherries.  Lightly tart cherry entry leads into a smooth chocolate flavor with a moderate oak presence moving into a light bourbon finish with a light tart cherry flavor in the finish.  Smooth with a nice oak bite and acidity from the cherries.  Sweet, thanks for sharing Nick.","Aurora, Colorado, USA","BlackForestCO"
453,"2008-06-14",4.1,"Very complex nose, with caramel, cocoa, tiramisu, bourbon soaked wood and cherry.    Dark brown color with a light tan head, just like regular cherry stout.  Flavors are well intergrated, dominated by chocolate and cherry juice notes, but also some vanilla, fudge  Only a light hint of the barrel.  Thin body, which is somewhat disappointing.  Overall, pretty happy with it and looking forward to seeing it progress.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
453,"2008-06-14",3.8,"Pours black with a reddish tan head that clings to the rim of the glass. Aroma is cherries, oak, vanilla, and whiskey. Much of the stout notes are lost in the flavor, leaving a cherry bourbon taste. The roastiness of the stout emerges and the flavors begin to mesh better as it warms. Im not convinced the bourbon barrel aging adds to the beer, but it doesnt make it worse.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
453,"2008-06-12",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 28, 2008 Bottle, batch #7777.  Black pour with a brown head that fades quickly.  Aroma is lots of bourbon with notes of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and subtle tart cherries.  Sweet blend of cherry, vanilla and bourbon in the flavor with a touch of butterscotch, chocolate,coffee and a slight vinous note in the finish.  Oily full body with lots of carbonation and a bit astringent.  Rich, a little cloying and the carbonation is a little too much but still delicious.","Berkley, Michigan, USA","punkrkr27"
453,"2008-06-11",4.1,"Batch #7777, bottle. Opaque deep brown-black body, oily, thin brown head. Buttery oak nose, tart, with cherry and roasted malts, but primarily barrel. Bourbony oak body, more bourbon than I picked up in the nose, soaking the roasted malts and not subtle but not strong tart cherry notes. Just a touch of roasty dryness in the finish. A rich slow sipper.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
453,"2008-06-11",3.7,"Batch 7777 bottle.  Pours very dark brown with only the faintest bit of light showing at the bottom of the glass.  huge and heavy nose of buttered oak, with the bourbon notes somewhat hidden or just plain light overall.  Sugary sweet butter and brie, with a small note of black cherries.  Sharp and rich on the palate, buttered bourbon is heavy, overall the beer is coarse and somewhat dry and rough.  Tannic almond/amaretto and stinky cheese/butter in the finish.  Interesting.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Pours a very dark, dense chocolate-cola color; fluffy medium-dark brown head with web-like lacing.  Chocolate-covered cherries and strongly toasted and vanilla-laden oak character (like a heavily oaked chardonnay) in the aroma; some sweet butteriness, with dark chocolate and ripe cherries lurking beneath.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: chewy, intense chocolate cherries, roasted malts, buttery bourbon, and solid chocolate presence; very generous, clearly expressed barrel character melded well with a beer I normally dont care for; just enough cherry coming through to make this an especially interesting beer; really great stuff, and the barrel character works nicely here.  Damn tasty.  Lengthy finish: dark chocolate, fudge, and some lingering red fruits at the far end; decadent.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
453,"2008-06-10",4.2,"Big thanks to Anwar for this bottle!
I dont know what it is, but Larry has a knack for picking the right barrels and amount of time for his beers.  This along with the BA Expo/DC, BA Java, BA Third Coast are all exceptionally done.
The balance between bourbon and cherry is perfect.  Only on a few sips did the bourbon dominate.  Mostly they were neck and neck fighting for the forefront.  Delicious mouthfeel.  Very good BA undertones.  The oak, vanilla everything melds well together with the cherry.  Good mouthfeel.
Im still waiting on the straight BA Expedition!  Bottle some of that for a brotha!","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AllAboutStout"

453,"2008-06-09",4.5,"One of the most unique aromas I have encountered in a long time. BBA roasted coffee grounds,distinct oak, and a butterscotch ,caramel finish. This defintely smells more like warm bakery then beer. Cherry not that evident. Chocolate and rich malts,with more roastedness and now some cherry in flavor,smooth and creamy,slight detraction is a little acrid bitter finish,like you would get from old coffee,plus I was never a fan of whatever Bells is using to get that cherry flavor,but I quibble. Absolutely remarkable in its complexity and barrel flavors. Thanks Kingpin","Muskego, Wisconsin, USA","brewblackhole"
453,"2008-06-08",4.6,"Pours out rich and dark with a deep carmel head that dissapates quickely. The aroma is startling and overwhelming. Odd and fantastic at the same time. It smells like an inky cabernet.
You get chocolate , cherry, vanilla, charred oak, and oh yeah you get the bourbon aspect as well. Its funky, yet... one sip and you know you want more. It coats the mouth with thick cocoa, subtle tart black cherry, and the alcohol . Its not hidden. well done but my guess was 8.5abv. and hey, It is what it is.

This is a great beer.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","fiver29"
453,"2008-06-04",4.3,"12oz bottle (thanks Derek!!!). Poured a dark black with brown edges and an averaged sized brown head. Aromas of wood/oak, vanilla, the cherries were present but not overpowering, some bourbon, and light smoke. Tastes of cherries (starts out sweet and ends lightly tart), vanilla, oak, bourbon, some roastiness, and light chocolate. Creamy body with the alcohol well hidden. Cherry burps. I found neither the cherries or bourbon was over done and worked well together. I had this one after dinner and it made a great dessert.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
453,"2008-06-03",4.1,"I am not a huge fan of the normal cherry stout or fruit stouts in general, so I wondered how this one would fair.  Aroma was a rich vanilla bourbon with a hint of cherries.  Taste was much the same, great velvety mouthfeel, big and rich vanilla cream, with a balancing cherry tartness and some roast as well.  I actually liked the amount of bourbon in this one.  Almost vinous at times.  I think my only problems are more with the fact that this is a fruit stout, but overall, this was great.","Holt, Michigan, USA","masonjer"
453,"2008-05-31",4.2,"12oz  Bottle. Noses a strong currant-tinted bourbon. Light roast backs up a warm alcohol sensation. Well blended and melded. Dappled with middle red fruits, pluots and cranberry. Not overly complex, but a little cold. Pours a rim in tan, with a deep black-mahogany and a brown rim. Palate starts out really oaky and dry, but then gracefully slides into a strong Mexican vanilla flan, custard and cream. Sweet, but not too much. A touch too barreled for me, but not bad. Im not drawing a ton of the beer base through some of the bourbon, but its expression is pretty decent. Vinous, some aged sherry and wine character. A touch curt as you keep drinking. Finish is impressive. Long, tart fruity. Complex. Just awesome as it develops. Really intricate and layered. Lots of different flavor. Excellent use of a barrel. Finishes forever in roast, cherry juice, bourbon and candy. Delightful! Thanks Sean!","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

453,"2007-08-14",4.1,"Tap @ GTMW 2007. Opaque and black with a lasting, thinning tan head. Aroma is alive with sinuous and decadent blackberries, cherries, raspberries, bourbon laced chocolate and truffles. Flavor dances with tart cherries and a hint of black cherries. The chocolate manifests in a tart, lactic order that cures palatary lust. Tart, balanced and altruistic, with red raspberry kernels melting into raspberry java juice. Soft, subtle carbonation accentuates the supple slick body while cherry talc slips through a sleek palate remembrance. Black raspberries and cocoa planted black cherries finish out the show.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
453,"2007-08-14",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 15, 2007 GTMW. Bourbon Barrel Cherry Stout. Poured from a mannequin dressed as Waldo. The odd thing about this beer was that Im not particularly fond of the non barrel aged cherry stout, but I happened to be near the Bells tent when this was being poured, and so who can resist a sample. Im glad I gave into temptation. Nose is bourbon and imperial stout, with a hint of fruit. Palate was thick and chewy, with flavors of malted milk balls, sour cherry, French roast, and a slight sweetness on the finish. It seems as though the components I didnt like about the cherry stout were much more rounded out and balanced here. Perhaps both the aging process and the bourbon together resulted in this being a fabulous beer.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
453,"2007-07-23",3.9,"Something I had in the middle of the Indiana Brewers Guild fest.  Dark Dark brown with a thin tan head.  Nary a sign of cherry initially. There is a big healthy bourbon stout nose though.  Sweet alcohol nose over a slightly cherry to oaky nose.  As this warms, the cherry comes out.  Thin body without much fizz of body, but this only makes this more drinkable, not watery.  Cherry obviates itself with warming.  Bourbon stout up front when cold though.  Roast, alcohol, and cherry beats out the sweetness, driving the balance out, but this isnt a bad thing in my opinion.  My only concern is that bourbon barrel aged cherry stout is something different than the oak aged cherry stout...","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"
