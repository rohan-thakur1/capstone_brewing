2866,"2017-06-17",4.1,"A surprise and happy acquisition on an out-of-town journey. If I had a Rochefort Trappistes glass I would have used it. I do not so a Chimay glass fills in. The 11.2 oz. bottle pours a very dark amber and delivers a frothy, finely bubbled, light tan head. The scent is red licorice, yeast and hard candy. With a drink I find malt, dark plum, raisin and a touch of spiciness. A small amount of bitterness comes at the end. I recall the 10 I drank as being sweeter than this and more complex. 8 is quite fine but I prefer other Belgians.","Midland, Texas, USA","KevinReddirt"
2866,"2017-06-14",4.2,"2012 bottle (expiration date 9/2017)
Appearance: pours a murky amber/brown color with a nice half inch tan colored head that dissipates rather quickly. very light lacing is observed.
Aroma: all about dark fruits, figs, plums and a hint of raisins. earthy phenolilc spices. a bit of toasted bread. dark candy sugar sweetness.
Taste: Lots of complex dark fruity flavors combine with deep candy and caramel sweetness. bitterness is bold without being harsh.
Palate: medium bodied with a rich texture, pronounced astringency and almost effervescent carbonation. Finishes malty sweet and smooth. Sensations, specially the astringency, diminish over time.
Overall: aging an almost perfect beer... is difficult. remains an outstanding beer but I would have to have a fresh one to side-by-side judge. its appearance is probably degrades somewhat, but despite its still bold flavors, its a smooth drinker.","Miami, Florida, USA","Rumbero"

The flavors off, though; alcohol comes across surprisingly pronounced, offsetting the hearty raisin/dried apricot/caramel sweetness with an unpleasant medicinal bitterness.

2866,"2017-03-25",4.4,"This is my favourite beer. Other commentators have already elucidated upon the aroma and taste of this Trappist, so let me clarify why I hold this beer among the giants of Ale. Rochefort 8, although not as strong and full of taste as the 10, has a certain ""aristocracy"" about it. It is noble in the humble way, never pretending, never boasting. No flashy signals claiming to be the best, just an old-school, classy label which in itself tells one that the bottle contains nothing short of the cream of the crop. This beer, while clocking in at a disheartening 9.2% ABV, is thirst-quenching. It is also a beer that makes itself known. One of few beers with which I can easily spend an hour. It is almost as if the taste, alongside its medieval-esque label, invites one to just relax and contemplate for an hour or so. As if the beer itself makes one think and sit back. Rochefort 8 is, for me, the perfect balance between taste and ABV, between price and quality, silently being just as powerful as it is inconspicious. A fine Ale, and nothing less.","NETHERLANDS","Kriddie"

W smaku jest silnie słodowo, oleiście. Piwo jest od średnio mocno do mocno pełnego. Pojawiają się jeszcze wyraźniej ciemne owoce, do tego dochodzi pralina, belgijska czekolada, karmel, opiekany cukier, słodycz trochę chmielowej ziołwości.

Après la Trappistes Rochefort 10, qui est une des références, voir LA référence en matière de bières Belges, je vais matteler à déguster sa petite sur, la 8, qui na rien dune petite avec ses quelques 9.2 bourrins sous le capot ! Rousse/Brune à la versée, troublée, avec une grosse mousse ivoire type Champagne qui redescend lentement mais sûrement. Arômes enivrant de pâtisseries, malts chocolat et en moindre quantité malts café, lait, noisette, cassis, mûre, cerise noire, fraise, pruneau, vanille, figue et banane séchées, mirabelle, poire, pomme bien sucrée, fond sur lorange, la mandarine et le citron vert, pain dépices, sirop dérable, cannelle, poivre, notes de mangue et de goyave, un peu de fumé, de bois, de notes acidulées, de cola... Limpression de renifler un bon Porto ! Sublimissime ! Rien à jeter, même pas lalcool qui ne vient pas jouer les trouble-fêtes... La carbonatation est plutôt élevée, pétillante, lalcool est vivace en bouche et tout schuss à la descente, la texture bien huileuse, capiteuse à souhait... Première main sur les malts avec toutes les saveurs sucrées quils entrainent, légère amertume cacaoté, pointes acidulés vivifiantes avec les agrumes et alcool liquoreux rappelant la prune ou la mirabelle. Seconde bouche avec un côté plus farineux, riche, ce qui me fait dire que cette bière à la tête bien faite mais aussi bien pleine. La troisième bouche rappelle quelques vins pétillants avec ce côté acidulé très présent et cette amertume sous-jacente, jamais ostentatoire mais qui ne nous quitte jamais vraiment. Le final est doux, apaisé, il arrondit lensemble et se pose en conclusion de la plus belle des manières. Petit côté cidre de pomme brut par certains aspects, bière qui ira finalement très bien à une bonne dégustation de crêpes un soir dhiver. La levure est superbe, bien noble, bien tenue. Cette bière est quelque part un savant mélange entre une bière brune, un Porto, un vin pétillant et un cidre. Et pas des plus mauvais ! Tout simplement exceptionnel... Une fois de plus la Brasserie Rochefort, ce nest pas nimporte quelle brasserie... Largement au niveau de la grande sur, et je me demande laquelle je vais finalement demander en mariage !

Il naso, all?inizio, ha un che di agrumato, netto, e nel complesso dimostra una forte caratteristica fruttata, spiccata e quasi sciropposa, con una evoluzione maltata, molto caramellata. Nonostante i 9,2°, questa 8 rivela un corpo importante, ma non eccessivamente consistente, con un impatto piacevolmente frizzante. Il sapore iniziale ricorda la liquirizia, con spezie in secondo piano, e una corsa finale morbida e calda.

Thanks, Tom!

My wifes uncle, Tom, brought this as a gift, along with Founders KBS and Acoustic Ales Instant Triple Karma. Unbelievably nice as I hadnt had the chance so have either. Have always wanted to try these Trappistes Rochefort beers, but this will be my first. 

Poured an auburn, murky color with 1-to-2 fingers of frothy, khaki head. Light bubbles coming up from the bottom. Minimal wet lacing. Average retention. (Sight - 4.00)

Smelled that 9.2 pct. ABV right away. Once that settled, got spoiled plum, toffee, some candied caramel, red apple, purple grape, raisins, prunes and more dark fruits. Funky overall. (Smell - 4.00)

Taste was a bit better, but still on those funky notes. Got roasted toffee, candied caramel, spoiled plum, raisins, prune juice, dates, rye bread, purple grape, red apple, some blackberry, hints of rum, light notes of chocolate and some wintry spices. (Taste - 4.00)

Medium body. Oily texture. Average-to-lively carbonation. Long, warming finish. (Feel - 4.25)

I really wanted to like this one but probably ended up overrating it as a result. It was good, but not something I would need to try again. Its not like Ive never tried a Belgian Strong Dark Ale (this was my 12th) but it was just good, not great. Maybe this is supposed to be the standard, but I reviewed it as is. (Overall - 4.00)

2866,"2016-03-05",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 17, 2016 Short lasting rocky white foam. Aroma of stone fruit and caramel. No chocolate, no nut and no coffee at all despite its color which is about 16 SRM, so that I guess its all due by brown candy sugar additions. Very very attenuated (I measured its FG: its 1006! Ridiculous! It means the OG is equal to 1072 and the attenuation is about 92%!), its ethylic feel is more than just subtle: its actually invasive and a bit unpleasant. Really high carbonation. Bodys just absent. Im a fan of Rochefort 10, a huge one, but this beer lacks the big sisters complexity. They used more sugar than malt. Why? Do the monks have any money issues?

2866,"2016-02-29",3.7,"That cheesecake beer pairing guide I shared a few weeks ago recommended pairing it with a Dubbel so I hit up Ohtsuki for a Trappistes Rochefort 8 (9.2%) and picked up some cheesecake to give it a try.

The rochefort is a dark oaky brown with minimal head and a rich raisins, bready cinnamon bun sweetness while the cheesecake contributes a creamy cheese and baked Graham crust in the aroma. Mouthwatering.

Full bodied but with a sharp carbonation and a bone dry finish the Rochefort presents boozy stone fruit, woodsiness and a herbal hop character. 

The cheesecake counteracts some of the dryness with its rich flavor and accentuates the spices and fruits. I get an image in my mind of eating butter cookies while drinking eggnog.

Heavy-hitting scent of caramel, Christmas cake, beet, molassess, ripe plums, dry figs, raisins, clove and nutmeg. Really great and intense, comparable to the Rochefort 10 and, just like it, even intimidating aroma, suggesting an onslaught of flavors. The promise falls slightly short. The taste is intense and powerful, but undermined a tiny bit by excessive dryness and a lighter than expected mouthfeel. Classic Belgian tartness dominates, its much less sweeter than the 10. Nutty flavors arise after a while, providing another dimension of flavor. I sense a fizzy carbonation and a mouthfeel thats too dry to feel this chewy Belgian bomb I was expecting. I like it a lot anyway. The finish and the aftertaste are a little bit dull. Even though I am slightly dissapointed, I can sense traces of grateness in-between the Champagne-like fizziness and dry character. This one is unripe.

Aroma is alot more subdued on this one compared to the 10, less of everything is what hits me! Still rich dark fruits, plums, figs.

Taste follows the same road of shadowing it´s big brother in awe i can imagine as it lacks something in all the categories compared to the 10, the difference in price and abv is just not justifiable to me to choose this over the 10 at any time if you can have any of them! If the 10 is not available the 8 suddenly becomes a top class belgian dark strong beer! 
Perfect example of living in the shadow of something better!

In addition to a malty aroma I can smell both flower and fruit as well as slightly perfumed aroma. It has an extremely complex flavor where both caramel malt and lots of fruit (plum, raisin) mixes with a little flower. It has a bit perfurmed taste. I can usually hate this tasty perfume, but in this splendid beer is so little to the other good flavors overtones it. The alcohol is present in the taste, but is by no means. Palate is huge and I can taste the beer for a very long time. As several other reviewers have already written, I would also strongly recommend that this beer can not be enjoyed too cold.

2866,"2015-05-27",4.2,"11.2 oz bottle, poured into an oversized wine glass at ~40 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours an almost opaquely murky red-brown, like a dingy bronze metal. Forms a relatively thin head of almost-white bubbles, which dies fairly quickly into a ring and a patchy cap. Lacing is adequate, somewhat patchy islands which slowly sink back down into the body of the beer.

Smell: Sweet candi sugar entwined with caramel and toffee wells out of the glass, bringing along some very faint hints of what might possibly be fruit - banana, raisin.

Taste: Caramel and toffee swirl to form the core of this beer, with slightly sour cherries filling in the lines where they twist together. Raisin and fig can be found as well, playing along the edges, with occasional cameo appearances by some faint banana notes. There is a sharp edge to the flavors, courtesy of the carbonation levels, but no real alcohol heat involved. The finish leaves behind a lingering ghost of caramel and bread.

Mouthfeel: This beer is loaded with incredibly prickly carbonation, and is quite lively indeed. Beneath the carbonation, theres a creamy, medium-bodied beer.

2866,"2015-05-24",4.8,"Pours a hazy, orangey dark amber with large, dense tan head that reduces very slowly but eventually leaves skim rather than lacing.
Despite the large head, the aroma is enormous: nuts, figs, rum, malt. You dont have to drink this beer to enjoy it, just drink it in. The taste builds on the nose, with chocolate, chestnuts, dates, pepper, bread, raisins, oak, vanilla.
The carbonation adds a creaminess that serves to clear these various notes, letting them stand out in turn and leads to almost neutral yet warm finish, less dense and sweet than its monumental sibling, number 10.
The 9.2 ABV suggests care should be taken, though it is not debilitating. But this is built to top off a meal, a liquid dessert, and makes a great finish to an evening.","","Pumpkin87"

I let this one warm for a bit from the fridge before opening, to maximize the tastes, which echo the aromas. There is a fairly thick mouthfeel,with a slight viscosity as it glides over the tongue. Its highly complex, and keeps adding to its repertoire with each sip. Definitely some alcohol presence entering the mix. Now getting some sweet nuttiness, and prune juice.

Aroma is syrupy sweet with fruity resin and a noticeable hint of booze with a single note of what I can currently only think to describe as brown. The carbonation gives a dry sense which is an interesting juxtaposition with the impression of sweetness provided by the fruity, fairly complex hop profile. Its big and mouthfilling and it truly is a great beer but its reasonably intense and varied nature makes it necessarily a one-off enjoyment.","Bristol, Somerset, ENGLAND","leebotton"

2866,"2014-12-28",5.0,"330ml bottle served around 15 degrees in a tulip glass:

Deep brown pour reminding one of prune juice exposing rich cherrywood highlights. The tanned head feels foamy, onctuous and settles down as a porous layer offering great lacing. The nose is nutty and has a lot going on with sugar cane, roasted malts, plums, dattes and even hickory and some smoke way in the back. The taste also has a lot to offer with a sweet attack from the sugar cane paired with the malts, resulting in a nutty chocolate presence with a subtle alcohol backbone. You get a medium lasting finish with a somewhat woody feature. On the tongue, this fine brew feels foamy as it explodes in your mouth and develops a nice oily texture. This is why I love tasting beer because once in a while you put your hands on a brew that just throws you off your chair (and for a good reason).

Grainy and bready flavours, with layers of caramel, toffee, red berries, plums, green grapes, some root beer/kvass traits, somewhat reminiscent of a toasty and chocolatey Scottish ale.

Overall, slightly thin texture for me, and the booze is not overly well hidden, but I know it is not meant to be. For the style, a little light, but very good tastes and aromas.

2866,"2014-09-16",4.3,"Transfer from BA review on 6-28-13-

 Poured from bottle into a chalice glass

 Appearance- Pours as a very hazy mahogany color with a big and billowy off white head. The head has a moderate level of retention, fading over time to leave a decent level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell- Initially when poured the beer has a more brown bread aroma mixed with a more mild dark fruit aroma of cherry and raisin. Mixed with these smells is a lighter yeasty 
smell. As the brew warms the darker fruits become more potent in aroma at the expense of the more bready smell. The cherry in particular begins to shine more with the yeasty aromas intensifying as well. This mixes with a bit of spice and a lighter boozy aroma to produce a rather classic and delicious Belgian strong dark like smell.

 Taste  The taste begins with a bready flavor mixed with a good dark fruit mix of cherry, raisin and plum. As the flavors advance the cherry grows stronger in flavor with more yeasty and spice flavors of coriander and clove coming to the tongue. Along this time a light boozy flavor starts working its way to the taste buds, remaining at a low constant level throughout the remainder of the taste. In the end a little bit of an almost grassy like bitter flavor comes to the tongue to leave a satisfying mix of warming alcohol and dark fruit flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel The body of the beer is on the averages side in terms of creaminess and thickness with a rather high level of carbonation. The higher carbonation mixed with the medium body create a rather crisper feel even for a brew of 9.2 % nicely complimenting the dark fruit flavors of the beer.

 Overall-A quite tasty brew overall. Not quite to the level of the 10 but extremely tasty none the less.","","Darkmagus82"

2866,"2014-01-25",3.3,"Reviewed from notes. She pours a dark brown and leaves the same colored body with some purple edges - interesting. There is a one finger white foamy head - very pillowy looking clings for a good minute and slowly dies leaving adequate lacing but the lacing dies within a good minute. The smell has a lot of booze up front, candied fruits (a combination of cherries and plums) with some figs and clove well presented. The taste has a wholly sweet flavoring all the way through and lots of booze. It has a boozy/slightly candied fruit aftertaste with a thick candied fruit sticky finish. On the palate, she sits about a medium to heavy. The ABV is definitely felt and in no way is remotely sessionable. The carbonation seems good. Overall, wow, what a booze bomb, just wondering how fresh this is, wonder what 290616 means. Im wishing I shouldve let this age for a bit as I think I had this way too early, next time I will definitely let this sit way longer.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Appearance: The body is a muddy brown to garnet in hue, with a towering, absolutely towering, foamy light tan head. The head has excellent retention, forming uneven craters as it slowly dissipates.
Aroma: The aroma is strong of carbonic acid, along with figs and caramel. The aroma leans sweet with brown sugar in addition to the figs and caramel, perhaps a touch of floral hops.
Taste: Big caramel throughout, becoming dark caramel by the finish with brown sugar lingering. Fruity notes are throughout, apple and fig come to mind. This is malty and fruity in all the right ways.
Palate: Big carbonation turns the thick body into a bready foamy body.
Overall: I might get flack for this, but this reminds me of a doppebock in many ways. Big maltiness of caramel and brown sugar with a big fruitiness.

2866,"2013-11-25",4.2,"Bière brune, trouble et mousseuse, aux reflets rougeâtres. Le nez offre du sucre dorge, beaucoup de fraîcheur malgré les apparences, du caramel, de lalcool et quelques vapeurs épicées. En bouche, lintensité se confirme, mais sans démesure. Tout est dans le dosage. Lacidité frappe en entrée, mais elle satténue rapidement au profit dun sucre résiduel qui nous enrobe les papilles. Des notes anisées flirtent avec lalcool, du palais à la langue, alors quun lit de sucre cuit sétale sur laxe horizontal (je suis très cartésien dans la dégustation, si si). La rondeur du produit est indéniable. Quelque chose de plus sec vient toutefois clore le débat avec des arguments clés comme «ouais, ça finit sec!».

Best by: 24JAN18
The usual look of dark caramel with a solid quilt of creamy tan foam. Smells of co2, buttered graham crackers, some bits of resin and almost mint, some grass and nuts as it warms. Flavor is malty, some nice nougat and sweet notes. Theres still a bit of the resiny, almost skunky character that is a little overpowering. Honestly the beer seems a little medicinal at this point. Medium bodied with moderate carb and an off dry finish. Having had this beer multiple times, and at different ages, it appears I most like this one around the two year mark. Considering buying a couple bottles to test this theory....

Last review: 15DEC12: 3.5/3/3/3.5/3 - 3.08
Bb: 01FEB17
Pours toasted caramel with plenty of light toasted cream foam (I spent a few minutes just killing foam so I could get beer). Smells of co2, light toasted nuts, some yeast and a little bit of malt - but really not appealing this fresh at all.... Taste is sweet with banana, alcohol, some sugar, some hints of toasted malts; again, really surprised how little I respect this today. Feels really thin and lacks the body Id expect from the beer, the carb is hi initially, but Ive mechanically removed much of it. Really disappointed in this right now. Maybe too young...

A: Pours a dark mahogany ale, murky (due to yeast). Three finger head of light latte falls to sheet of the same. Good, coarse lacing. S: Malt, Brown sugar, raisins, dark fruits, figs, molasses. Dark, intriguing. Very nice and complex. Malts are excellent here.T: Above, then add graham and beautiful, bready yeast into the mix. Outstanding flavor. M: Full body and high carbonation. Wish the carb was a little high on this one. Too bad. O: Absolutely gorgeous beer. No question Rochefort is among the top five Trappist breweries.","Spokane, Washington, USA","harrymel"

2866,"2013-10-26",4.0,"(bottle from LCBO) Pours a clouded reddish brown, orange around the edges, head of big white bubbles is short-lived without lace. Aroma is rich and complex as anything: fruit and some spice, makes me thing of cooked plums, maraschino cherry, spiced apple sauce, marzipan, vanilla, burnt sugar/toffee, sometimes seems like just a hint of cocoa/roast. On the palate it initially has a little sweetness, black cherry with a bit of caramel, light spice. In the middle it dries out and becomes a little vinous, earthy, a bit more spice. Finishes quite dry, persisting alcohol, somewhat bitter, noble-type hops and a sweet/tart fruit core, really mineral aftertaste. Body medium, carb is effervescent, not hard but palate-scrubbing, bit of alcohol from mid-palate on. This is good stuff, no doubt. In the mouth it seems to be cleared up by the bitter/mineral/carb nature of the finish. Maybe its that Rochefort water? Love the nose, wish the palate had more concentration later on.

Very complex but not an overwhelming taste that features malty and nutty flavors. Concludes with a dark chocolate aftertaste. Oakiness is noticeable throughout. This beer can go for $13 a bottle at a bar but is worth every penny. It's an authentic traditional beer style worth trying, and at 9%+ it's a hefty double the average alcohol content.

De smaak ligt ook hier in het verlengde van het aroma. Deze is aangenaam licht doch rijk genoeg om met fijne accenten het geurrijk pallet in smaak om te zetten. En subtiele gebrande mout smaak maakt het helemaal af.
Het mondgevoel is aangenaam en spontaan en vooral lichter verteerbaar dan de Rochefort 10, dewelke overigens tot 1 van mijn absolute favorieten behoort.

Colour is deep dark orange all the way to dark brown with a nice big blonde head leaving lacing. Aromas and flavors are sweet toffee, anise, pear kind of Belgian yeast and raisiny dark fruits. Mouthfeel is thicker than medium with a heavy carbonation. Finish is long with a fair amount of bitterness, pepper, raisin and anise. Has a feel of alcohol but not the taste. Not quite complex. The bottle has aged for a year. The anise is much stronger than the last time, I dont like it. 
Original Rating from 2013
Colour is reddish brown with some nice foamy head and lively carbonation. There is lots of sweetness and dark fruits typical to a dark Trappist beer and also a fair amount of hopping in the finish. Is a bit lighter and less complex than the Rochefort 10. 7+4+8+4+15=38","Tampere, FINLAND","Andy_"

Like 6, pours a frothy tan head (had to be quick as the bottle surged as soon as the cap popped).  More of a dark reddish amber. Initial aroma surprisingly mild - subtle dark caramel with a bit of grass/wood. Poured into goblet and with warming, cocoa, and earthy aromas arise. Maybe some hints of dark fruit as well. Alcohol rises up as well. Carbonation falls quickly leaving a nice lacing.  Taste is mildly sweet with some raisin and dark chocolate. Sourness noted with slight astringency. Bitterness is lingering and is light as well. Definitely more alcohol heat than in the 6. Mouthfeel is creamy and creaminess lingers in the finish.

Taste is slightly sweet with a bit of dark cocoa and again a reminder of dark fruit. Alcohol heat with each sip noted. Mouthfeel is quite thin with an oily feel remaining. A lightly bitter and boozy (pleasant like dark rum) aftertaste remains on between sips. A nice dubbel at a decent price.

Mittel- bis dunkelbraun mit reichlich Schaum; einen Rot-Ton kann ich nicht feststellen. Das Aroma ist sehr gelungen. Zuerst eine weinigartige Note wie griech. Mavrodaphne, auf jeden Fall einem mediterranem Likörwein ähnlich. Dann auch eine schöne beerige Fruchtigkeit und darüber hinaus auch veritabler Aromahopfen, einfach geil! Der Antrunk ist voll, aber nicht scharf nach Alkohol. Die Hefe zwar zu erschmecken, aber nicht dominant. Vielmehr ist der Geschmack einem Früchtekuchen ähnlich, getreidig und gegen Ende auch herber nach Hopfen. Die 9,2% drücken zwar auf die Süffigkeit, sind aber nie penetrant oder gar scharf. Etwas mehr Geduld und ich hätte bestimmt ein noch besseres Trappisten-Bier vor mir! Fazit: Genießer-Stoff!

Aroma: Very fragment and sweet dark malt, with strong caramel, strong toffee, strong plums, figs, vanilla, light liquor, strong sugar, strong Bel yeast, faint lemon and light grass.

Taste: Strong sweet dark malt, with caramel, sticky toffee, burnt toast, strong dark chocolates, plums, Sherry, strong alcohol, strong liquorices, strong sugar, strong yeast, lemon, quite strong bitter hops and grass.

Body: Full body. Thick and slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Very good dark maltyness in a very stout background. Good caramel, toffee, burnt toast and plums with strong shaves of dark chocolate. Quite a joy! Yeastyness is somehow not as powerful as other BSA or Trappists. Nice treat overall. 

Booze: Very strong liquor with flashes of Sherry. Lots of liquorices for to beef up the bitterness and balance the sugary palate. A bit too strong, though, a fast hitter!

Hoppiness: Faint lemon and light grass in nose, and stronger in taste. Bitterness is mostly liquorices-induced for an abrupt, strong astringent sweet malty finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Very boozy and strong sweet-bitter to mouth.

Comments: With Rochefort 10s strong whiskyness, this 8 falls into the strong boozy BSA category with some good Sherry and dark chocolate tastes, but its overtly boozy without the creaminess of Chimay Blue. Its hard hitting for sure, but also a bit overboard without the sophistication. Very good but not great.

Dark ale brown colour; Medium head and frothy, cappuccino colour foam with very good carbonation (still bubbling while in the glass for a long time); Fine smell of caramel, orange peel, vanilla, yeast, malt with trace of alcohol; hops taste minimal; Smooth to mouth with medium body; Sweet taste throughout, with lingering taste of toffee; lacing is minimal compare to Chimays; Hop taste is minimally subtle, which quickly give way to strong alcohol feel to the mouth. At abv 9.2%, its strong and explicit, but it doesnt have the kind of sudden rush Chimay Blue has until after 10 minutes or so.

Comment: the 8 has all the making of a stylish Trappist beer - good colour and body, suitable lacing, pleasant strong ale taste, and boozy. Compare to Chimay Blue, however, its sweeter, less smooth in body, and a stronger alcohol character, Its very decent by all means, but Chimay Blues palatable smoothness won my heart. Will see whats like in the ultimate 10.

Aroma is composed of a little licorice with fruity elements, definitely sweet with a malty backbone featuring nuts, caramel, and some alcohol. Malty yet bitter in taste just some hidden sweetness, easily comparable to the scent but it loses some of the characteristic fruitiness. Really elaborate, burnt sugar, wood, delicate plums hard to describe everything with all that stuff coming at you at once.

Hides the alcohol very well, but you know it is there by that happy viscosity that coats your tongue when you take a sip - excellent thick, creamy mouthfeel, without feeling like you have to chew it.

2866,"2012-07-15",3.8,"I poured an 11.2oz bottle into a Trappist chalice.

Appearance: Dark brown color, proper. Plenty of spastic carbonation visible. Forms a large, beige, foamy head which doesnt fizzle away completely  but doesnt leave much lacing on the glass.

Smell: Surprisingly milder nose with a generic Trappist ale scent. Some dark fruits and hints of clear liquor sweetness. A hint of rum or vanilla, some alcohol.

Taste: Both the Trappistes Rochefort 6 and 8 are technically ""Belgian Strong Dark Ales"" as opposed to ""dubbel"" proper, but it shows in their taste. Whereas the 6 was overtly sweet and on the lighter side, the 8 is a little more intense all around. Quite mild up front with only a hint of bitterness, the 8 finishes with a very different palate than it begins with. A milk chocolate and almost tart fruitiness finish the palate here. Similar to a chocolate covered cherry or some kind of Starbucks concoction. While sweeter on the ending than the beginning, this beer still ends with more of a thud on the palate. Rum-like flavors combined with tart fruit make for a more ""serious"" drinking experience. Theres a sweetness to be found,  and its delectable for sure, but seems to be a bit lacking considering the strength of the beer. 

Drinkability: Whereas the 6 felt and drank like flat soda, Trappistes Rochefort 8 drinks like a traditional Trappist brew - spastic and peppery across the tongue with plenty of carbonation building up in the throat. Its not a sipper, but theres more of an aftertaste and an alcohol presence - which isnt surprising considering its quite hefty at 9.2% ABV. Yet theres no alcohol warmth and only a mild dryness to the palate. Not sweet enough to qualify as a dessert beer, this is more of a nightcap.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

2866,"2012-04-15",5.0,"A Rochefort, on est généreux ! En effet, la ""10"" fait 11,3 abv , la ""6"" fait 7,5,
et notre amie daujourdhui la ""8"" fait 9,2 % abv....
Donc on fait plus efficace que ce quon annonce sur létiquette.
Voilà une philosophie que beaucoup de brasseurs feraient bien de méditer !!! 
Pour ce qui est de la pratique du goût et des saveurs, jai toujours trouvé 
que cette ""petite"" soeur de la grande 10, navait rien à envier à elle.
Je la trouve hyper complète dans les sensations, parfois même, sous
certains côtés plus fine, plus capiteuse, plus ronde, plus déliée et somme toute plus équilibrée. 
Mais nous naviguons dans les très hautes sphères. Nous sommes au
sommet de lart du brassage, il faut le savoir, et nous parlons donc dinfimes détails qui peuvent constituer une petite différence...
Pour ce qui est du rating, puisque cest ce qui nous occupe, je suis pour ma part à 300 sur 100 pour la ""10"".
(voir ma critique de cette bière).  Donc en termes de nuances, la compétition va être difficile... Pour lanecdote, mais ceci vaut la peine dêtre mentionné, jai dégusté la dernière fois la 8 chez des amis
en Belgique avec un repas où la maîtresse de maison est une très fine
cuisinière, qui a touché aux repas professionnels etc., et jai choisi la 8 dans la cave de mes hôtes pour 
lassemblage de cette bière à un repas de belle composition. Cétait absolument sublime, et confinait à ce que lon trouve de mieux dans le 
mariage vins et plats. Encore une fois, soulignons que la 
bière na rien à envier au vin sur laccompagnement à la nourriture, et 
jai ce soir-là été en pure admiration de cette bière qui représentait une
sorte de plénitude, au sens propre du terme. Un état de béatitude.
Nous lavons comparée avec mes hôtes aux meilleures vendanges tardives, par exemple de lAlsace
ou du Pacherenc du Vic Bilh.
Nhésitons jamais à faire ce genre de mariage dans les beaux repas de
famille, et même bien sûr de cuisiner à la bière, qui est un ingrédient dune très grande noblesse pour parfaire les senteurs dun vrai repas.
Je rappelle que les grands chefs ont en tout des dizaines de recettes très fines avec les meilleures bières, et principalement avec les trappistes qui sont un sommet dans les arômes que lon peut trouver dans le domaine de la bière.... Fin de mon appel à ce bonheur de vivre !!
Revenons à la 8.
Cette bière est en fait une ambrée foncée. Donc elle est plus claire que sa grande soeur.
Rappelons aussi que Rochefort est la seule trappiste à sortir toutes ses bières en brunes, ce nest pas 
anecdotique...
Merveilleuse mousse beige et grande vitalité du pétillant.
Arômes dune finesse profonde et dune sorte de velouté, que lon ne trouve pas dans la 10.
La prise en bouche est extraordinaire, et révèle immédiatement le niveau auquel on se situe.
On est dans les tops du top... A ce propos, je dois dire que je ne comprends pas comment nous
navons que 24 notes maximales à 5/5 au rate, alors quil y en a 127 avec la mienne pour la 10 !!
A mon sens nous devrions avoir exactement autant de notes maximales pour cette 8, parce quelle
est en tous points comparables, voire supérieure...
Le problème est que supérieur au supérieur est très difficile en termes humains.
Heureusement, nous sommes ici en présence dune bière divine. Donc nous pouvons surenchérir !!
La 2ème et la 3ème bouche monte en amplitude... Donc nous avons la preuve matérielle que lon
peut faire mieux que mieux. La levure est sublime (je la connais dailleurs en version naturelle !)
La finale nous révèle une bière dun niveau astronomique... Nous sommes au 7ème ciel...
Léquilibre est magistral. La plénitude se retrouve à la dégustation, exactement comme dans le
repas chez mes amis. Preuve dune bière complète en elle-même.
Et en effet ne dit-on pas que la bière est du pain liquide ? 
Le degré dalcool est plus adapté ici à la dégustation que la 10 qui titre quand même à 11,3 !!
Ici à 9,2 abv, on est au niveau supérieur du qualitatif, sans être assommant.
De plus, on trouve ici des notes de miel de châtaignier, de dattes, damandes que lon ne trouve
pas dans la 10, et qui en font un fleuron du savoir-faire trappiste du plus haut niveau.

Best before 8th Nov this year, I poured it slowly into a Westmalle chalice, ensuring no sediment left the bottle. The body was a deep amber brown colour, murky and moody looking, the thin head of small bubbles just about covered the whole glass, with stronger depth around the rim forming a collar.

The smell was of old sweaty, yet sweet molasses and treacle.

The taste is also old/sweet, a strange combination of flavours, difficult to differentiate or seperate without waffling.

The rich maltiness from those sweaty molasses contains the alcohol content very well, I had real problems picking up the 9.2% ABV this beer has.

The head is an incredible light gray color with top caliber retention and lacing, and how the carbonation rises up from the body to form the head just looks right. Its almost impossible to fault the aesthetic presentation of this one.

S: Pear, clove, coriander, raisins, figs, and a hint of chocolate create an incredibly complex and grand aroma.

T: Taste follows the aroma, with impressive complexities yet top-notch balance. Tart pear, raisins, figs, black currants, touches of dark chocolate, and I swear theres some cherry notes in there somewhere. Its true hallmark is how each sip yields a subtle change in flavor. Also, the yeast profile is just right, it gives a backing contribution to the bodys complexity without getting too much in the way and becoming overly chalky. As great as this beer is, I kind of expected a little more, to be honest.

M: Medium-heavy bodied with a smooth, vaguely dry finish. The yeasty astringency is kept perfectly in check, giving it surprising drinkability factor. Lowish carbonation.

2866,"2012-03-31",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2012 (First Taste, Home, 330mL Bottle, Vintage Apr. 2011, Tulip, 9.2% ABV, Cellar Temp, 31/03/12. #30.)


Appearance (3/5): Pours a cloudy, muddy brown color, with an average sized, creamy brown head that fully diminishes and leaves little lacing. Lots of sediment.

Aroma (8/10): Incredibly complex. Dominant dried fruit and spices: raisin, fig, cloves, and cardamom. Additional notes of citrus, toffee, molasses, and rum. Alcohol is quite notable on the nose.

Taste (9/10): Initially acidic green apple, then very sweet raisin, fig, and chocolate, then roasty molasses, toffee, and spices grow into a lightly bitter finish that lasts quite a while and unfolds over time. Something here reminds me of rum, especially when it warms.

Palate (4/5): Medium body with lively carbonation. The texture is interesting; not quite thick enough to be creamy, but very slick and oily. Silky. Almost light, ""vanishing"" finish with a delightful warmth.

Overall (18/20): Surprisingly drinkable, especially considering the 9.2% ABV, which is well hidden on the tongue. The aroma is very good, but maybe a little too much alcohol presence. Appearance is honestly nothing special. The palate borders on excellence, but needs a little more body to get there. Taste is layers upon layers of goodness. Very well balanced, very delicious. Im excited to try the 10.

Drinkability: 3/5. Character: 5/5. Buy Again: Definitely Yes.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","jrizko"
2866,"2012-03-30",4.3,"330 ml bottle into chalice, best by 5/11/2016.  Pours super murky dark reddish brown color with a nice 1 finger dense khaki head that reduces to a thin cap that lingers.  Spotty lacing on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up.  Aromas of huge raisin, plum, grape, banana, molasses, pepper, clove, biscuit, toasted grains, and huge yeast spices.  Incredible aromas with a ton of complexity.  Taste of big caramel, molasses, plum, raisin, biscuit, banana, clove, pepper, and yeast spices.  Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, banana, pepper, and yeast spice on the finish for a good bit.  Great flavor balance and complexity.  Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel with a bit of prickly carbonation.  Quite smooth to drink at 9.2%, but is still a sipper.  Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish noticed.  Overall this is a fantastic Dubbel.  Big complexity and balance; and extremely enjoyable.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

2866,"2012-03-08",3.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 9/8/2011.  Poured from a 33 cl bottle into a Rochefort chalice. It feels right that the inaugural pour into the glass is a Rochefort.

The color is a deep, murky cherry brown. The bubbles on the frothy off-white head visibly burst and the head fades to nothing quickly.

This is an exotic aroma. A strange tartness is not the most dominant, but it is the most noticeable. After thinking about it for a few minutes, I think it is green apple and tart cherries. Combined with some rum, red grapes, plums and figs, this is quite interesting.

The flavor starts sweet and boozy. Rum, plums, sweet cherries, and figs start out with some caramel malt. A light tartness in the middle, white grape, green apple, some tart cherries. The end has some ethyl alcohol.

The mouthfeel kind of irks me. It has the beginning of a creamy feel, but then some obnoxious heavy carbonation overwhelms everything. The body feels on the lighter side of medium despite the ABV.

This is interesting and different, but the carbonation and rum flavor really drop this for me. Kind of disappointed.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Clear brown with minimal, evanescent head. Aroma of dried fruits which, after much debate we decided was dominated by fig and additional dark cereal notes, toast, hint of molasses cookie and soy. Second sniffs got us thinking about herbs and spices. Descriptors aside, the combination is beguiling-you want to smell it again and find out more. 
Theres a bit of sweetness balanced by barely enough bitterness. The palate is creamy and balanced by a generous carbonation. The finish is exceptionally long with malt dominating along with some sort of berry fruit.  I expect Ill still be tasting this beer tomorrow morning.

Ar- The aroma is a rich spicey fruit cake. Nice caramel, fig and cider aromas. A bit of peppery yeast brings it together with alcohol.

Ap- The body of the beer is a dark mahogany with ruby highlights to light. Yes if you dont back light this beer you are missing out. 

T- The beer delivers on the aroma big time. The spices open up a bit more cardamon, cinnamon, and nutmeg. A but more frutiyness fig, raisins, dark berries. The finish dries out due to spice, peppery yeast and alcohol.

P- The body seems to be light but I think this is due to a scrubing nature to carbonation. The alcohol is a bit hot. I think the heat would fall out with a little age.

Flavor is a blend of candied fruits and slight boozy character that fades into a touch of alcoholic heat on the tongue.  Carbonation is surprisingly soft and lends a very thin and almost watery palate to the beer; though there is complexity enough in the flavor to balance it out overall.  Dangerously drinkable for the style, and I quickly envisioned pairing this beer with a fine cigar.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Lanchester"

The dark fruit aromas have got a lot stronger, same thing with the liquorice. Some similarities with Mikkeller Santas Little Helper 2008. The sweet elements on the flavor seemed to have smoothened a bit too. Still very complex brew, definitely have to save some bottles for near bbe date tasting.

Pours dark ruby red with large head which leaves a little lacing. Theres a lot going on in the aroma, orange peel, earthy malts, belgian yeast, sugar candy, caramel and some prunes and raisins. The taste does not fall short with its complexity, dark malts, yeast, sugar candy, caramel, orange and raisins. Additionally, a bit of toffee and licorice at the end. Lots of carbonation, some sourness, a bit sticky palate and a bitter finish. Full-bodied, complex and very enjoyable.

A world-class beer, even. But its not the 10...  Pours dark brown with a medium tan head. You really have to hold this beer to a light to appreciate the complexity. Its murky, not fizzy. Theres so much sediment, so much stuff in there. The color changes depending on the light... As with the 10, its an easy 5/5 on looks alone. Aroma is rich, with lots of dried dark fruit: prunes, raisins. Theres port wine there, and alcohol which is surprisingly present (much more than in the 10...). Also brown sugar, pepper and a hint of dark chocolate. Taste is malty and sweet yet complex with a very subtle yet clearly present bitterness lingering in the background. The alcohol, again, is quite present.

It completely blew me away. It is every bit as good as they say it is. Aroma is a bit of leather mixed with a bready, yeasty. Appearance is brownish red with a cream colored head that doesnt die.

2866,"2011-04-27",5.0,"UPDATED: JAN 2, 2013 Aroma: Sour, like vinegar...a little reminiscent of a lambic. Earthy, complemented by a subdued smell of candied sugar and raisins. Malts and booze arrive at the party but arent the main guests. 

Appearance: Ive had this beer in a few different glasses and the slim Trappistes Rochefort tulip thingy makes this beer look ace, though the aroma is slightly sacrificed. How you pour it will have a direct effect on the amount of sediment, clarity and color of the beer...its usually a murky brown, but I was careful and got a clear, dark blood red/brown. Some carbonation. Head is off-white, very active and diminishes quick, though that is very dependent on how old the bottle is. Beer looks very dark and sinister and scares all but the most curious away.

Taste: Caramel, dark chocolate, bit of coffee, earthy, woody flavors with a somewhat yeasty finish...this is like drinking a fruitcake. You can find lots more if you take the time and ""hmm"" and ""ahh"" about it. Complex and well balanced.

Palate: Oily and clingy...but it complements the beer well. Nice carbonation too thats tingly, though its appearance has you thinking otherwise. Alcohol isnt transparent but it does have a bit part to play in the character of the beer.

Overall: Stands in the shadow of the 10? How could you. Each grade has a different feel to it...different moods or occasions will call for whichever one I want at the moment. Nobody makes a better beverage than Rochefort...I hope theyre proud!","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","RD400F"

Spicy, medium body, sweet and peppery (is that allowed in a beer review). Beer bites me at first, a big shock. Im thinking I should grab a few of these and age them for years. Drinkability is good and mouthfeel is good. Second taste, beer is a little thin for my expectation, taste is pretty good, a little bready / biscuity, not as aromatic or honey like as I expected. Overall a good beer but not my favorite trappist.

The mouthfeel was spot on for this beer. It was medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A little agitation bring a nice collar throughout the drink.

Re-rating, 2011-06-24, 8-4-8-4-16=4
When I started my ratebeer career 4 months ago I thought the Rochefort 8 was the best beer ever. 130 ratings later Im eager to check if this still is pure perfection.
Poured into a Rochefort chalice this is a beautiful beer, with an everlasting tan head, excellent lacing. True, it is a bit murky with large lumps of sediments settling at the bottom of the glass, but still the appearance is upgraded from 3 to 4. I remembered this beer to be far more intense, both in aroma and flavours. Medium sweet taste with a very light bitterness, or is it the alcohol that is biting? Aroma stays at 8, taste is downgraded from 9 to 8. Medium body, lively carbonation. Overall is down from 18 to 16. Ouch. It is still a remarkable beer, but Im no longer sure if this is The Best Beer Ever, the beer that all other beers should be compared to. Does it really give me more than e.g. Nøgne Ø #100? Or Mikeller Beer Geek Breakfast? Or more relevant, Rochefort 10? One thing is for sure, I better re-rate Rochefort 10, maybe that one is as intense as I remembered Rochefort 8 to be...

4.5 A: Murky medium brown color, like apple cider or something. Two fingers of light brown head with excellent retention and lots of lacing.

3.0 S: Aroma really isnt that impressive. Its pleasant, but not strong enough. A bit of dark fruity esters. Not really any spiciness. Pretty boring.

3.0 T: Caramel malt, some dark fruit. The yeast characteristics are really subdued. Im not getting any spiciness. A little boozy, which mellows toward the end. This is a very one dimensional brew. This really doesnt do it for me like the 10 does.

4.0 M: Lighter medium body. Carbonation could be a bit more spritzy. Really creamy.

3.5 D: Why this beer is in the top 100 is beyond me. I liked it, but it cost way too much for how mediocre this is.

If I didnt know better, after the first whiff Id think I was about to drink falls fresh apple cider.  Apple cider is also the first thing that comes to mind upon drinking.  There is also some sweetness from dark fruit flavors that sort of counters the spice and vinegar of the apple cider flavors, and just a bit of very subtle belgian yeast, too.  Theres not even a hint of the ABV, on the other hand.  The mouthfeel is great, as theres plenty of carbonation, something that is often lacking with many a Belgian Strong Ales.

Nose: whole grains, cracked wheat, bran, rye seeds; amazingly bready in a crunchy versus chewy way. Raw brown sugar. Marzipan. Fruitcake, dates, candied sugars. Dried grapes and apricots. Cardamom and paprika; spice more in the back as a whisper then as an active trait. Gentle sweetness up front fades into the crunchy breads.

Palate: wow. How I love Trappist soft frothy mouthfeel for a full breadiness without the harsh abrasiveness of raw carbonation. Stab of sweetness sin the back of each swallow; fruitcake, candied sugars, dried dates. Spices weave in and out, blossoming best in the finish with cinnamon, paprika, and cardamom. Practically floats across tastebuds she is so gentle. Lovely addition of dried apricots and grapes. Dab of bark and dry fall leaves for a whispery presence of earth. Plum and grape skins in the back; tart. Doesnt dry nor does it coat. Cooked brown sugars mingle with marzipan for a glazed sweetness kissed in caramel. ABV is nowhere apparent or intrusive. As warms apples make a showing, more juice then flesh or skin. Beautiful.

On the other hand, I feel that its lighter body cant support the high alcohol content as well as the bigger brothers intense character does. Re-rate: Bottle from the cellar, 19 months old. Colour is clear amber - much lighter than I remember it to be, almost as light as a fresh ""Rochefort 6"". Compared to a fresh bottle the aroma has faded quite a lot. Taste seems to have mellowed out quite a bit: the fresh vanilla-like aspects have faded but so has the alcohol intensity. Its just subtle and incredibly smooth in every aspect now. The fresher bottles can have a bit too high carbonation but on the other hand I really like the intense vanilla/dark berry aroma of a fresh bottle.

Au goût, dans la continuité totale des arômes : le malt est fortement présent, lalcool est piquant avec son caractère très poivré et les fruits se définissent davantage : des saveurs de raisin et de figue explosent sur la langue.  Aussi, présence de sucre brun qui donne, mélangé avec lalcool, des petites pointes de vieux rhum.  En bouche, le liquide est de densité moyenne et sa texture est crémeuse.

The taste is a step above the aroma with an array of flavors hitting me all at once.  There is an initial sweet fruit and yeasty sweetness which gives way to the chewy malts and candi sugar forming the backbone.  The finish is sweet and rich with a boozy presence and a lightly dry finish.

The nose seems closer to the Six than to the Ten, though this is may be due to the softer alcohol presence.  There is a bouquet of raisins, grapes, dates and apples, which is given some heft by the candied sugar.  Mouth feel is medium thick and honey like with a fine carbonation.  Taste is of the nose: sweet, perfectly balanced and just a hint of alcohol heat.  Finish is long and complex with the fruit developing into old, earthen hops.

2866,"2010-06-02",4.5,"Bottle.

A - Dark cloudy redish-brown color with a fair amount of yeast. Beautiful, large foamy, meringue like, off-white/very light beige head with great retention

S - A lot of juicy dark fruit with raisin, plum, fig and date (loaded with them all) with just the slightest hint of them being rum soaked. Some dark malt and plenty of spice. Also a strong phenol/medicinal aroma. Overall the strongest is a juicy plum/raisin smell with a fair amount of phenol.

T - Plenty of dark fruit (as in the nose) with a plumy taste being pretty strong. Nice dark malt base with hints of chocolate and a good amount of licorice coming out. Well spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, and other spices. Phenol/medicinal flavor is fairly present, not quite as strong as the nose, but definitely there. Also a touch of earthy bitterness.

M - Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Pretty smooth and creamy.

D - Very drinkable beer, especially given the ABV and style. Lots of juicy and jamy fruit flavors along with a nice balance of malt and phenol/bitterness. Alcohol is well hidden.

Notes: Best before 14/10/14. Very nice beer that I very much enjoyed. Plenty of fruit and some dark malt have a wonderful taste and are well balanced making a good example for the style. A good amount of phenol/medicinal taste also present, but adds a bit of a kick. Licorice is fairly strong for the style. Overall a very enjoyable and solid beer from a great brewery.

2866,"2010-04-22",4.1,"I got this as an extra in a trade with DLucky...and it is definitely an awesome extra...really excited for this one. Aged 11.2 oz bottle poured into my Chimay chalice (both brewed by monks...right?). Best by June (or maybe March) 09. Rochefort has limited availability in PA and is very expensive.

A- This is a beautiful beer. Pours perfectly into my chimay chalice with a 1/2 finger head with perfect retention. Traces of lacing are left all the way down the glass.

S- The nose is very pungent and at first loaded with a nauseating grain alcohol odor with a big barleywine-like maltiness (Im not a fan of most barleywines). It was hard to put up to my nose at first...but upon further inspection the nose is quite complex. Strong phenols are definitely upfront and what I noticed initially. Fermented grapes/raisins, a sweet bready yeast, funk, and a soft spiciness come through almost as equal upon further inspection.

T- Fermented grapes raisins and/or plums upfront with a soft spicy yeast backbone. The gingerbread spiciness comes through a little more for the finish along with a slight alcohol warmth. A slight soft spiciness lingers on the back of the palate.

P-The mouthfeel is perfect. Low carbonation and medium to lightweight body loaded with yeast. Extraordinarily smooth.

O- This is an awesome beer that took me a few sips to warm up to. At first I didnt know what to think about this beer but it very quickly grew on me. It is a nice, well put together Belgian that is complex and very smooth. Im sure the aging process has helped a lot with the mouthfeel and maybe has hindered the nose. After some aging its still a bit boozy and it would be hard to drink more than this bottle. One I will have again (if found at a decent price).

The aroma is floral and earthy with notes of cherries, some nuts, and some sweet chocolaty malt. There really isnt as much to say about the aroma of this one as I found to say about the other two, but the beer is damn pungent and everything is so clearly defined and pleasant that this one smells damn near perfect. The flavor is dry, far drier than the aroma lets on, I was expecting a far fruitier and sweeter beer so at first the alcohol presence seemed a bit overwhelming but after a few sips it seems to perfectly balance a lot of other things that are going on in the flavor here. The beer is summed up pretty well in three words fruity, nutty, and earthy. To be more specific on the fruit though there are certainly the sort of expected dry/dark plum and raisin type fruit things going on but there are some rich almost pie cherry like notes in there as well along with some apple. Im not getting any pear which is a bit of a disappointment as the pear notes were one of the coolest things about the Rochefort 6, but I suppose they make three different beers for a reason right? There are of course the rich earthy tones that work well with a cavendish like tobacco flavor and the lighter chocolate tones.

2866,"2009-11-24",3.8,"33cl bottle, as pictured.

Pours a cloudy dark brown with a medium beige head. Ok retention, decent lacing.

Aroma of fig, banana and liquor - with a citric edge. 

Fairly active carbonation in a heavy-bodied strong ale. Full, but fizzy mouth feel.

Taste strongly reminiscent of Jamaican rum(!), but its not too sweet. Fig and banana are as evident here as they are in the aroma, and the malty bitterness nicely balances the fruit and alcohol. Lots of interesting herbal spices in the mix, the whole thing reminds me somehow of a Christmas desert. Herbaceous finish and mildly alcoholic after taste.

This is a most agreeable, superbly balanced Belgian strong ale that shows that basic sweetness can be a plus as long there are enough bitterness and spice to compensate. Very likeable.","Offenbach, GERMANY","sound67"
2866,"2009-11-23",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2010 One exceptional brew. Full in complexity of taste. Extremely full bodied in nature. Poured warm into my old stlye Rochefort glass with yellow writing on. Smells of figg; prunes, dried fruits. raisins and candi sugar.

Texture is pure black tar. Red is settled at the bottem. Tastes of carmael; figs, raisins, prunes candi sugar and well measured roasted malts. Very complex brew. Lovely to sit there and contemplate theory of life with. Not as good as the 10 but very close. Lovely boozy and heart-warming finish which is fruity and not burning, just a stunning winter drink. Smoother and more easier going than the 10 as it carries less alcohol.","Essex, ENGLAND","tdtm82"
2866,"2009-11-22",3.8,"11/22/2009:  Trappistes Rochefort 8...  Aroma:  A bit sweeter than the Rochefort 6; dark caramelized fruits and malt sugars; other characteristics like that of deep red wine; maybe a hint of something herbal or even like peppermint.  Appearance:  Dull brown color; murky/cloudy and opaque; frothy beige-colored crown.  Flavor:  ""Darker"" tasting and more rich than the Rochefort 6; caramel; dark brown sugar; roasted chesnuts; hints of chocolate; notes of creamy sherry or other liqueur; something that I can only desribe as watermelon; a splash of vanilla; more alcohol, but all of the flavors are also heightened as well; oxidation is starting to set in and is detracting a little bit from the overall flavor...  Palate:  Medium to medium-full carbonation; good level of carbonation; slightly sticky on the lips.  Overall:  Definitely obvious that this is the bigger brother to Rochefort 6 since the characteristics are similar, but everything is bigger; this a very good beer priced at $4.99+tax/bottle!

2866,"2009-11-02",4.3,"This brew poured with a pretty neutral brown hue. It was pretty murky - probably because I got the end of the bottle, so bits of barley were in the head and in the brew - it made it look like coffee. There was also a fantastic off-white head that lasted for quite a while. It had a pretty sweet scent with a hint of coffee and hops in it. Strangely, on first taste, the first thing I got was alcohol. This is pretty strange considering most brews will have the alcohol taste at the end. It reminded me strongly of a thick cappuccino and it ended very sweet. This was wildly different than most other high-alcohol brews that we have where it starts alcoholic and ends sweet.

Somehow it manages to be both completely dark AND cloudy, though how you can see clouds through the dark, I dont know. But this beer does it somehow. The flavour is so smooth at first your sort of waiting around for it to pick up and then its all up from there.

2866,"2009-09-16",4.1,"Cloudy, deep brown in appearance with a generous head. Unsure if beer is naturally hazy or if I disturbed the yeast a bit too much

Nose is the real treat with this beer. Reminds me of a clean brewery, some unfamiliar smells along with the yeasty bready aromas that you love. Take that and combine it with many desert spices that are elusive, maybe brown sugar, nutmeg, Christmas pudding, and Irish bread pudding with amaretto topping.

On the palate the beer is noticeably thin bodied and carbonated well but youre just so enchanted by the nose that you dont care what else there is. Yes, I cant get past the nose. No need to comment on taste.

Looks like rootbeer. Has a 1/4"", very thick tan head. Excellent 360 degree lacing. Tons of muck and a good amount of granual like sediment. The aroma is awesome. Intense spice, dates, burnt sugar, soft liquid banana flavouring, I swear I can smell candied orange rind. Dont drink it yet...keep smelling...ahhhh. It just keeps changing. So very comples. The 8 has an amazing blend and balance of the spice and fruit. Tasty yeast and seems almost meaty. THere is a good ammount of alcohol along with the caramel, licorice, plum or date, oranges (weak).... I think thats it. Incredibly smooth and full bodied. The harsh spice seems to turn soft - soft harsh spice that has turned soft, sweet and chewy yeasty stuff. Mild but lengthy aftertaste that has left my mouth soft. How many times did I type soft? Hard bitter last sip with all that sediment that ended up getting a bit sour.

First off, it looked dead in my glass -- a syrupy amber with suspended floaties that dont move. It looked solid. The smell, admittedly, is incredible. Theres toffee, plum, even a little menthol (?) -- its big and sweet and reminded me of a barley wine. The flavor is pretty good, too -- sweet malt, dark fruit, and candy. Theres a good deal of booze in there too -- its a little hot. The body makes it hard to taste the beer -- its syrupy and the carbonation is jacked up.

Moderate carbonated head mostly diminishing, but not as much as the 6.  Lacing throughout as opposed to zero for the 6.  I agree with another reviewer - the aroma is pretty mellow, more to me than the 6.  Malty, figs, raisin, alcohol evident on the palate and in the finish.    With that said this is quite an enjoyable brew - wow!  Update Jan 16, 2011.  Same purchase date as one drank May 2009.  Wanted to cellar for two years to see how this one turned out.  Trying to find much update, other than it is an exceptional offering.  I truly understand why many prefer this to the ""10"".

2866,"2009-04-29",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 1, 2009 This thing is a religious experience. I prefer it to the ten, I find it more balanced and 3-dimensional. On the one hand: This thing was all soft edges, slick in the mouth, soft rich maltiness, pruneau or something, a little bit of smooth (debittered) chocolate. On the other hand: very spicy and dry, with a firm bitterness. Unmasked hot alcohol, at one moment even too much; very warming, with phenols reminiscent of spicy cinnamon (pungent cinnamon, not powdered) and even cardamom. Oh my god. I expect the people I was staying with thought I was crazy. I was doing stuff like sniffing my sleeve to clear my nose, swirling it and covering the top to collect volatiles, rolling it around my mouth. Neither of them wanted any (!!).

Appearance - deep dark color with alot of freaking head geez.
Typical for belgiums I guess.

Nose. Well excatly what you expect from a very good belgium dark ale. Reminds me of westy 12 and abt 12 on the nose/

The mouthfeel is of spice and plums and raisin. Very freaking smooth

Drinkabilty this is a beer that could hurt someone very easily.

Belgiums are not my favorite style and I could only do one of these but from an abstract review this is a very good beer if you like the typical belgium strong ales.

However, when my novitiate introductions to ""good beer"" are limited to Belgians (i.e. Chimay Blue) and the like, I think Im doing okay.  I excitedly imbibed Rochefort 8s in Cleveland (at Melt Bar and Grilled, where they also have 10s available) this past St. Patricks Day, having heard legends and tales about these beers from Ratebeer, Beeradvocate, and elsewhere.  I wasnt disappointed.  Served in its intended glass, the 8s aroma instantly whispered of rich darkness, fruit undertones, and a syrupy alcohol burn (all of which were enhanced when I took my first sip of the dark, reddish-brown elixir).  An initial burst of effervessence, quickly tapering off into a smooth, lasting alcohol burn that, while present, didnt distract or delay the other flavors - dark fruits, dark sugars, caramels, and an overall sense of depth and complexity.  A head that lingered without being overly frothy.  While I enjoy my Chimay, this took the experience of that beer and amplified its awesomeness to a further degree.  A truly delicious beer, which I understand to be a weakling in wonder next to its older, 10 brother.  I cant wait to venture forth into further Rochefort experiences.","Ohio, USA","breathinghope"

Sampling Notes:
Served lightly chilled in chalice.
Pours pretty much perfectly! Dense rocky pale tan head atop a murky, effervescent, chunk-laden, deep mahogany body.
Interesting and deeply complex nose; plenty of earthy spice in the foreground, clove, cinnamon, pepper, possibly even nutmeg! Has a citrus zestiness about it, a tobacco leafiness too, leading onto more malt driven aromatics of brown sugar and bread/cookie dough. Faint vinous red/black fruits emerge with warmth.
Lucious velvet-like texture, length is very good maybe not as much as the 10, low creamy carbonation. Body dries out eventually but very well hidden alcohol.
Fruit cake-like body, with all of the trimmings! Brown sugar, dough, almonds, clove and cinamon, brandy, sultana, dark cherries and blackberry, a bit of lime and bitter citrus rind seems to lift the palate. Goes down warming, somehow the alcohol alludes all other perception. Lingering dryness with a mishmash of flavours once again reminding me of fruit cake.
Once again a ridiculously complex beer from those crazy monks at Rochefort. Definately need this one to breath and warm up a bit before tasting, it smooths out and becomes far more coherent...and delicious.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

Fortunately the metal doesnt carry through into the flavour, which is raisins, chocolate, banana and port.  Despite the strength, these flavours are not wiped out by an alcohol burn - this is a well balanced beer.  Despite the too-high carbonation, it is actually incredibly smooth to drink.

Good, and remarkably drinkable for its ABV.","Maryland, USA","NomDeBeer"
2866,"2008-10-27",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2014 I have seen and heard a lot about this beer but was somewhat skeptical. Usually the highly rated Belgians are flat beers full of alcohol, thin and cola tasting. This was definitely not the case with this beer. There was a good amount of carbonation, a healthy head and an opaque cherry wood hue. The smell was a spicy carrot cake and the initial flavor was sweet molasses and ginger. The aftertaste wasnt lingering or alcohol laden for a beer of over 9% ABV. Caramel and syrup gradually became more apparent, almost the palate of malt extract, very delicious. This is one of the most complex, varied beers Ive tried. Looking forward to the 10.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","jebb12"

2866,"2008-10-25",4.0,"330ml from Forest City in CT.  Settles a dark brown chestnut with a pearly beige head.  Aroma of barley, grapes, dry wine, and bread.  Palate has a nice substantial thickness to it, complemented by prickly carbonation.  Upon sipping, I immediately recognize this is a beer about subtlety:  unlike most other beers of this ABV, Rocheforts flavors are content to simmer, hint, and layer.  Consequently, it is hard for me to put my finger on what I am tasting.  OK, so there is definitely bread, brown sugar, and dried fruit.  But there is much more.  I can see where people are getting cherry and vanilla notes from the body.  By half way through the bottle, I had begun treating this beer more like an Old Ale or Barley Wine.  It is earthy, old, and mellow.  Notably, if you give Rochefort time to sit, it responds by revealing all of its character.  My opinion:  tasty, but not on par with the RB rating.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"

It could be the licorice element which stands out a little too prominently for me  - I’m not a fan of Licorice at all so points lost there.

2866,"2008-08-02",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2009 Bottle. So I didnt put a lot of effort into rating this one, but after 1500+ other ratings, its probably alright. Already rated the 10 and the 6, and, well, this one smells like a Rochefort, same earthy yeastiness, yeasty breadiness, same rich fruitiness, just in between the other two. Lots of figs, apples, raisins, pears, prunes, etc., some nuttiness, lots of toffee, its a Rochefort, nothing Im going to say is going to change anything. I will say that I dont understand why some folks prefer this to the 10 because to me the 10 is magic, and this is just a breath away in pretty much every regard (hence my numerical rating of 1 point less in each category than the 10). ...Rerate Ive basically decided it smells and looks as good as the 10 but falls short once it gets in the mouth in terms of filling the mouth with all goodness the 10 does....

Light alcohol burn but certainly not as boozy as the 10 (which I love, but youve got to be in the mood for boozy).

2866,"2008-07-12",3.8,"I had quite high hopes for this beer, and to be honest, was slightly dissapointed. I was certainly not wowed. Pours hazy brown with lots of residuals. Aroma is of fruity yeast, apricot, and spice. Evident, but not profound. Flavor is of cider, fruit, cherry, and nuts with some fruity esters in the back. Malt is evident and quite complex, but not as hard hitting as I was hoping for- much more subtle. Palate is really quite incredible- prickly at first, but subsides to become incredible smooth and unassuming.

Mildly fusely flavor with winy yeasty notes and twinge of yeast sourness on finish. Lacks the complexity I would expect and desire of a beer of this style, though otherwise, this is a very good Belgian Strong Ale. Well crafted--especially considering the knock-you-over-the-head alcohol content! Re-rate: 5/17/10: Viscous auburn-tressed amber. Candi malt presence with higher crystal malts and hints of bubblegum.

Taste is creamy and full, with a flavor that starts out as sweeter syrupy hops, some dark fruit, caramel, and molasses before opening up into a dry finish of wood, spices, and a twinge of warming alcohol.  Unlike Chimay, Bernardus, or any of the other Belgians, there doesnt seem to be much difference between this one and its big brother the 10.  While its still delicious, it cant help but feel a bit like a somewhat less mature version of the 10.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","WallyWalrus"

First: Very cluttered deposits, surely due to age. Does not hurt the taste very much if at all. In pouring, the color went from rather clear red, to a ruby, to an inpenetrable dark brown. Head was fleeting at best, though hangs on to a thin film. Again, likely due to age. Notes of cherry, alcohol, nuts, yeast, and peach. A very layered set of flavors, and very nice. Hoppy and aromatic. Whiffs of dust and cardboard. Nice lacing. Palate is crisp, sandy, and subtle. Long lasting fruity finish. A very nice beer. I think that a fresher one will do even better.

The nose is exceptionally complex, so much so that I have difficulty pulling out individual notes. My best shot at describing it would be: spice cake, light chocolate, and a combination of peppery, floral, and fruity spice notes. Medium-bodied with assertive, fine carbonation and a dry, spicy and moderately astringent finish; chest-warming alcohol follows the swallow. The flavor more-or-less follows the nose with a lot of pepper and a flinty, dry finish. I can appreciate this one as a well crafted beer, but I have an aversion to heavily spiced brews. This one is just way too spicy for my liking. Perhaps with a bit of age, it would mellow. The date code on the front of the label reads 160812. I assume that means August 2012.

I dont know why so many people like these beers? Is it the percentage of alcohol that fuzzes the clear thoughts?

Taste is also very complex. Dark malt and yeast provide a foundation while several flavor notes dance upon it, including caramel, raisin, fig, pepper, exotic nuts, caramel, chocolate, and peat.

Mouthfeel takes a hit because its too carbonated. The 6 and the 8 have this problem, while the 10 seems to have it under better control. The carbonation is distracting, yet fine enough to make the beer go down quite smoothly. Great full body.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

[Rerated 3.15.09]  So for a mere 1.25 Euro I received a 15cl pour of this at ZBF, who could pass that up?  Unfortunately, everyone who tasted it around me thought it was quite off, a sugary mess, obviously very young, so this begs for a rerate. From bottle,  pours a clear glowing reddish brown that is way too dark to see thru with a small thick fizzy dense patchy froth.  Fantastic aroma, quite rich and doughy, dark fruits, bitter and yeasty draws parallels to the westy.  First taste is very dry with a touch of alcohol, bitter, then sweet and nutty.  This is quite fantastic and Im glad what I tasted at ZBF was not completely representative.   Flavor again has similarities to the westy 8.  As is warms flavors become nearly burnt toffee, candi sugar, alcohol blends nicely, nutty, doughy, with a bitter dark fruit plum yeasty finish, almost licorice. A tad too much alcohol and flavors maybe too subdued.  Full mouthful, medium/full body with sharp abundant medium fluffy carbonation, a bit too airy at first but then it settles down.  Im starting to think that I actually like the 6 the best??? oy (I have a few aging so maybe itll make its way back into my top 10 in good time)

I assume this might be similar to a barley wine situation... have to get them over that harsh oxidation hump... maybe.  Seems to bit sweeter and quite round, fruity, near cloying, less character than before, enormous amounts tobacco in both the aroma and flavor.  Lots of protein floaties. The body on this aged 8 is absolutely perfect, fluffy, full, medium viscous, great soft abundant carbonation... really nice.  Much better as is warms, the tobacco is so interesting but its all starting to brighten up a bit and it actually pretty damn tasty.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"

Flavours are just as complex, with fruit and toffee sweetness upfront, a bit of chocolate, and then a strong licorice finish. The thing that really holds this beer back is the palate, is just found it a little thin, and watery to be holding all those flavours. I like this beer, but I was expecting more.","Guelph, CANADA","wilderthanyou"

2866,"2007-12-29",4.0,"Maybe it was the hype of the name, but I just wasnt as knocked out by this beer as I expected.  It is no doubt a solid brew, with a gorgeous fluffy head that stays to just cover the beer and add some lacing.  I didnt really get a lot of different flavors in this.  It was simply a good, straightforward beer for the most part.  My wife sampled it and likened it to beef stew with a heavy dose of cooked carrots.  I didnt exactly agree, but think it would pair really well with that meal.  This beer does have an exceptional mouthfeel.  The amount of malt sweetness, carbonation, and hops are perfect.  It is so smooth for this high of an ABV.  You dont notice the alcohol in the taste, but you sure feel it in your head.  This is an extremely drinkable beer for this high of an alcohol content.  It is no doubt a world class brew, but it wasnt my particular favorite.  I did drink it by itself at around lunch time.  Maybe like Chimay Blue with barbecue, it really shines with a meal?  Again, not my favorite, but certainly worth a try, and definitely brewed with love.","Canton, Ohio, USA","TyRip"

A light scent of very sweet and hoppy Belgium ale that smells carbonated and warms you up right away. The hoppiness is very noticeable and balances well, it has a very light orange undertone with a super slight coffee smell after it leaves the tongue, and it becomes more prominant as it warms.

Flavor is that of figs, allspice, and a hint of what might be juniper soaked in dark, sweet wine (really, thats what I came up with).

The taste was, at the start, quite disappointing but after a while different tastes like chocolate, coffee, toffee, raisins, dark fruit and berries  appear. A sweet beer, with some alcoholic taste and a oily feeling I think. Very good!

26/3/08: This one is almost as good as its stronger brother, but not really. Compley, heavy beer. Vinous. Notes of the typical yeast. Taste is sweet, with much berries, plums, raisins, chocolate, toffee, caramel and brown sugar.
 
09/1/09: I also had this during a blind tasting (or more of half blind tasting, I knew what beers I would be tasting but not which one) together with the 10. Didnt take any serious notes but it felt thinner than big brother. This bottle was 1 ½ year old at it felt balanced, vinous and aged. Those dried fruit flavours which tends to come out better with aged was there. Also some fudge... I dont know if this one won that much by aging. Its a good beer but nothing like the 10!","Karlstad, SWEDEN","Ljunkan"

I dont know how to describe the taste; it tastes a little different every time I take a drink. It gets mellower and more citrusy as you get through it. Its getting better as it goes along, which is a first. Most of the beers Ive rated lose their flavor, but this just keeps growing on me. I went from a 3.3 to a 4.1 as I upped the flavor and overall from 7-8 and 17-18. Appearance: pours a deep, amber brown with a good head, good head retention.

This is all comes to an end with a alcohol feel.

Thick and yeasty, but doesnt overwhelm the mouth. A little more of the alcohol and a warming going on, much more evident, whereas the 10 sneaks up on you. Finishes very clean, maybe a hint of fruit on the tongue. A classic.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"

2866,"2007-11-18",4.3,"Dark brown with a big creamy quite lasting tan head. Strong aroma of roasted, coffee, ripe fruits, such as figs or whatsoever, vanilla, some earthiness, a floral touch, chocolate. A slight bitterness and a hint of acidity, due to roasted malts, and a complex mix of what  ive already mention in aroma. I found it a more bit rough in mouth than is little sister 6. Warming indeed, and very nice.","Lovere, ITALY","Scauca"
2866,"2007-11-17",4.3,"33cl bottle. Pours dark clear ruby with massive dense and creamy offwhite head. Could sit and watch the lacing for hours.  Mildly spicy and cocoa-like, somewhat floral, with a pleasant fruity tone and some earth notes. Perhaps the best thing about this beer is how well-rounded it is; nothing jumps out above anything else.  Mouthfeel is one of the best around: deluxe, velvety, oh so smooth and finishes very clean for an ale, a slight herbal bitterness clinging to very little yeasty bite.  Alcohol starts to warm towards the finish, but in a very welcoming way.  If anyones figured out the new marking method (mine has L130612 08:08 imprinted on it) please message me.

2866,"2007-10-29",3.3,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2008 Black like the monks vow of silence the beer pours into the glass bowing its  dense head. A solemn but weak aroma of overripe fruits and raisins covers a port like beer with liqourice, caramel, fruits, syrup, candy sugar, alchol and spice in the flavour. The carbonation is electric with lots of tiny air bubbles that prevents you from tasting much until you swallow. Somehow this results in a little throat fire towards the end of the beer, leaving me aching for a Westvleteren or a Chimay instead.","Odense, DENMARK","Blom"

Excellent beer, simply fantastic.","Split, CROATIA","heavy"

The taste mirrors all the that I find in the nose.  Its really weird to think of this beer and Duvel in the same category.

2866,"2007-10-26",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2007 33cl bottle from Systembolaget.   A dark red/brown beer with a clear body and a good sized lasting head that matches the label.   Streams of bubbles trail up the glass toward the surface.   This is at this point in time probably the best aroma of any beer Ive had.   Its simply amazing: raisins, cherries, grapes and yeast come leaping out at you, and then an extremely potent cotton candy/toffee aroma last till the very end.   The flavor is not as complex, but is very inviting, with porty/winey character.   Its sweet, but not cloying, with very restrained bitterness.   Maybe the best part is that its not to thick; a little syrupy, but overall finishes clean and easy.   I would drink a few more of these if I could, which is dangerous considering the alcohol, which only makes itself known with a warming in the throat.   This is an amazing beer.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"
2866,"2007-10-23",3.8,"Pours with a huge head, I had to pour it in sections the head is so huge, and longlasting. Good lacing throughout. Smells somewhat like raisins, reminiscent of wine in a way. I must admit to not being the biggest fan of fruity tasting beers but this one is really good. Smooth with just a slight hint of the alcohol in the aftertaste, well done.

As others have mentioned, there is a strong smell of raisins in the aroma, but I also picked up port. The flavour is full of dried fruit, spices, and well-concealed alcohol. Like a Christmas pudding soaked in rum. The body is smooth and almost creamy, leading into a surprisingly dry finish that almost hinted at oak.

Similar to the Rochefort 10 in colour and texture, a nice dark amber tone, creamy head that is off white, and doesnt dissipate too quickly less lacing qualities to the Rochefort 10, but still good. It also has a great aroma to it, very fruit and nutty which is also noticable in the taste of it..

I did notice some sediment at the bottom of the glass.  The aroma is not strong, by any means.  It is masked at first by the pillowy head, but it eventually opens up to reveal some dark fruit and cola-like smells.

The nose does not tell much. Smells like a spiced sugar cookie. Indeed, this buttery sugar cookie note is one of the key elements. This beer is definitely a sweet after-dinner treat! Vanilla notes strengthen the sugar cookie resemblance. Spicy notes of cloves and hops. Some fruits in this liquid cookie, but theyre hard to pinpoint--prunes, raisins, black cherries, perhaps figs as another suggests.

Extremely complex -- everything from red wine to flowers in the flavor.  A beer thats kind of like a Tarantino flick: I probably need to drink it again to pick up subtleties I missed.

Rochefort 8 poured the darkest murkiest brown into my goblet. When held to the light there are small mahogany highlights where you can see frantic carbonation and some tiny floating yeasties. A 1 finger slightly off white head formed on the pour that stayed put and left moderate lacing. This is one of those murky belgians that looks like it will be loaded with flavor.

This beer is packed full of strong dark aromas. Too many for me to list accurately. Brown sugar and rum soaked raisins are what come to mind first. Big doughiness along with dark fruits such as figs and blackberries. More fruits are in there too but theyre difficult to put a finger on. Mild yeasty powderiness. Smells delicious.

Flavor is rich and complex. Brown sugar and raisins are present in the flavor as well. Strong doughy background that allows all the other flavors to really pop. I find myelf repeating the aromas but theyre in the flavors. Figs and very mild blackberries are a couple of the darker fruits along with ripe plums. Powdery yeast on the finish. Alcohol warmth and fumes in the throat but no signs in the flavor. Fruity sweetness lingers.

A very fine, strong carbonation turns the body frothy when it enters the mouth. My only complaint, and its a very minor one, is it turns frothy to quick. Id like it a bit farther back on the palate.

Wonderful flavor and smell make this beer a pleasure to sip away.

A great beer from Rochefort. One to be pondered after each sip with all the complexity. Truly enjoyable.

Flavor: yeast start with earthy notes. More complex and agreeable that the aroma. Toast malts, brown sugar, candy, toffee, truffle, wood and light smoke taste. Fruitiness like plums, figs and dark raisins. Sweet beginning that progresses to the hot tone of the alcoholic graduation and finishes in a slight bitterness of hop.

I would say less of an aroma than 6. The smell is a litte spicey and the tast is noticeablely spicey. Fuller body feel than 6, maybe to hide the stronger alcohol%. Besides spicey, maybe a hint of some kind of sweetener like choclate. Sweet start, smootth throughout the tasting. Even as I finish the bottle poured to a glass, it maintains the spiceyness.

Flavor of candied fruits, pale caramel malt, yeast, lemon zest...a bit of pepper perhaps...but quite controlled...a few other spices and some light booze.

2866,"2007-04-09",3.4,"Pours a muddy dark brown with a large fluffy long-lasting off-white head.  Aroma is surprisingly subdued in my opinion.  Its dominated by the earthy spiciness from the yeast, with some cloves, grapes and maybe vanilla.  The rest of the beer experience is thoroughly dry.  Taste of more clove-like spice, some toast, caramel, raisin and perhaps a few other bitter/yeasty flavors that I cant quite pick apart.  Finishes dry and bitter at first, but the bitterness doesnt linger in a hoppy way.  I guess its just from the yeast.  Mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is super-high, so some glass swirling helps.  I appreciate the complexity, but the dryness overwhelms me and counters the sweetness too much.

Not letting this beer warm in the glass is a waste. Notes of herbs, wood, dates, butter and light alcohol were also prevalent and a fairly strong element of dough. Head is off-white and frothy with good lacing. Color was a hazy brown. Flavor is initially sweet and acidic with an average length finish which is both bitter and acidic.

Notes of more berries(mostly strawberry and huckleberry), dark fruits, yeast, hefty malts and copious candi sugar are seemlessly blended.

Re-rate.  I tried all Rocheforts together in one tasting.  Since then I have had the 10 again many, many times but Ive yet to try the 8 or 6 again.  At the time I thought the 8 and 10 were equally good, though different.  I now have my doubts.

This beer is remarkably similar to the 10.  It contains most of the same aromatics though this is sweeter and is yeastier.  The ten is more complex and has some darker characteristics and a little bit of pine while this is fruiter.  They both smell great though.  The taste is the big difference for me.  The mouthfeel and flavor of this are just not near the 10 in terms of quality or complexity.  Side by side this seems almost watery though it is more drinkable.  Alcohol hidden well.

The foam lasts a long time in a quarter-inch layer on top of the beer.  Flavor is dominated by sweet malt.  Hop presence is minor.  There is also fruit and some wine, as well as wild game.

Flavor erupts on the palate in a seltzer foam of dried cranberries and effusive plums. Very carbonated on the palate. A nip of honey and some extremely volatile alcohols evaporate into the humours with some scotch-like elements. After a brief thin sweetness, this beer dissolves into a lightly oaky crispness, with pale sugary pipe tobaccos, woodsy tannins and plant leaves.

Pours a hazy muddy brown with a dense two finger head, that fades slowly to a thick cap that never entirely fades, leaving behind a thick sheeting of lace.

Smell; lots of dark fruits present with figs and prunes, with some apples and pears. Molasses and chocolate are present, as well as a bunch of spices.

Taste; good malty sweetness with hints of chocolate and molasses, with a little bit of candied sugar. The fruits become more pronounced once this warms, with prunes, figs, apples and some apricots. This finishes with a bit of a peppery spiciness, and a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, and very easy to drink.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

The mouthfeel was rather carbonated. The flavour had roses, roasted malt, plum, raisin, pear, nuts, a bit of cinnamon, resin and alcohol. The finish had light bitterness and alcohol. Overall impression was a bit perfumed, but nice.
The next was 24½ months old and the alcohol was still present - but not nearly as much and the prickly mouth feel was gone together with the perfumed notes. Aroma: fruit (apple among others), caramel, candy sugar and roasted malt. The flavour has notes of dark fruit, plum and others, roasted malt, caramel, nuts, sweetness and a nice citrus as counterweight and towards the end a bit of licorice or dark chocolate.

I have been waiting for a special occasion to open this and rating #400 seemed as good a reason as any.  Ive been sitting on it for about two years now so it should be near its peak.  Perhaps I will drink another bottle fresh to compare if I can find it for less then $6.99.
Aroma / Appearance - The half finger eggshell colored head sat beautifully on top of a body the color and consistancy of maple syrup.  A creamy ring of lacing stuck to the sides like rings of age on a redwood.  The aroma was very complex.  It started with pecans and vanilla.  Soon it morphed to honey, white chocolate and hazel.  By the time I was ready to take sip it took on the scent of fresh smores.  It was very sweet, balanced and inviting.
Flavor / Palate - The vinous mouthfeel permeates every corner of the mouth.  A peppery combination of graham crackers and marshmellows washes over the senses first.  It then transforms into cocoa, caramel, honey, pears and cinnamon. Once it finally begins to fade the taste of toasted rye sits on the tongue.  The alcohol is well hidden, only coming out only at the very end.  This is almost on par with the Rochefort 10 and just as good as Westy 8 in my opinion.  If it were cheaper than $6.99 a bottle I would pick it up every once in a while.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Dried fruit also.... complex aroma.   Flavor matches up with the nose well, except there is much more dark fruit (plums, prunes, figs, etc.) and caramel malts.  Light, refreshing bitterness counters the sweetness well.  Hugely bubbly palate, a tad oily.  Its easy to see why this is a world class beer.

Flavor: Not as complex, but the flavor is very nice. High alcohol content is well-hidden, and oxidative sherryish notes along with a sweetish, candyish flavor make for an interesting flavor. Some berry notes in the finish, as well as light vanilla notes.

2866,"2006-11-08",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 25, 2006 The aroma is sweet and sherry-like, but subdued. The beer is a deep, mild brown in color, with a thick, cream/light tan, sparkling head. The flavor is sweet and spicy. It is so complex as to be almost indescribable. The texture is silky smooth, but it maintains a kick. This is a very drinkable brew, especially for one so high in alcohol. I continually had to remind myself to slow down and make it last. Rochefort Trappistes 8 surpassed my lofty expectations. I think I dreamed this beer, and drinking it was a dream come true. I can honeslty say that this is the best beer that I have ever had.

The nose only hints at is what to come, but the flavor and the mouthfeel is what makes this beer sssooo incredible, somewhere between the best brown and a yeasty double, this beer is wonderful!

2866,"2006-10-28",4.4,"While I loved 10 I like this one better - this is newly an all time favorite of mine.  Poured very dark amber brown with a creamy light tan head.  The aroma is incredible containing cream, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cocoa and lactic qualities.  It reminds me of a cross between a trappist ale and a very high quality sweet stout.  Medium / full body with quite a bit of carbonation that is very non-intrusive to the flavors.  Taste starts with milk chocolate, toffee, caramel, light bits of earthiness.  For the combination on the taste I am reminded of a cross between a top quality scotch ale with chocolate given a Trappist twist.  The finish adds some spiciness that seems to be from hops.  Oddly enough with as rich and full flavored as this is the finish is crisp.  It comes across incredible.  There is a small lingering toffee taste left in the mouth.  You could never tell this is 9.2% except for the effect it leaves, it is hidden exceptionally well.  This is a top beer in my book.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

Much like my ChrisTania, proof that there is indeed a heaven...Nice, diminishing head with sticky lacing.  Can serve cold right out of the fridge with little or no bitterness or bite.  Head diminishes but never completely.  Each swish of the glass reveals a complex, heavenly bouquet of light bananas, sweetbread, spices, friuts, and caramel.  Flavor follows suit and is quite incredible - if this doesnt make you smile then I cant say what would...Mouthfeel is silky and drinkability is top notch.

2866,"2006-10-14",4.1,"330. Pours deep ebony, closer to black than any real brown. Thick, moussy, highly bubbly tannish head that sticks around a good long while, but after a couple of minutes it stops trying to be the 800 pound gorilla it is during the pour. Leaves a thick waffle batter lederhosen of lace down the glass as it falls. Any jingoistic pride ye Belgians feel for the term ""Belgian lace"" is well served by this beer. Enormous green apples on the nose, mixed with cherries and the tiniest bits of funky hay and grass. Great combo. Thick, foamy mouthfeel with a decent spritz of honest CO2. Attack has more of the sour tree fruit along with some highly roasted notes--the roast snowballs across the tongue and leaves an amost acridly bitter char to the finish. Crazy combinations of flavors everywhere with this one. Hard to imagine it being any more perfectly what it is.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

Dried fruit, apples and apricots, some citrus, honey.  A bit of metal in the taste, but otherwise incredible. Obviously strong with sweet dried fruit and also some bitterness.  Very dry and a bit too fizzy, but it goes down smooth with relatively little alcohol bite and a very long old fruit finish.  Very complex interesting flavor but not perfect.","New York, USA","kopher"

Nose is nice, Belgian chocolate, roasted nuts, raisin, and plum, maybe even a maple note.  Flavor is dominated by the Belgian chocolate richness but never becoming cloying with smaller notes of dark caramel, raisin, pine nuts, and fig.  Palate is medium to full and soft, with a round, almost chewy texture.  Finally finishes fairly long and still sweet, but drying out just a hair with notes of maple, fig, and faint pine nuts.  This one is less complex than the 10, but is more approachable and hides the alcohol incredibly well.  More emphasis on the Belgian chocolate than the additional fruit flavors.

I know that might seem a bit sinful to say, but the cats already out of the bag. Aroma was dark fruit but very withdrawn for my liking. It didnt reach out and grab my nosehairs like I thought it might and twist them into a knot. Instead it sort of wafted about like a stroll thru the park, minding its own business. Appearance was a dark read in color, nice head with good lacing. Mouthfeel was a bit carbonated for my liking, full bodied and strong with a nice alcohol bite.

The mouthfeel is quite nice - it isnt nearly as thick as other strong, sweet beers - no doubt due to a fair amount of belgian candi sugar used to thin the body.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Aromas of rum cake spices, fruity, pears and ripe figs and nice fruity esters, the alcohol whiffs are quite pleasant.

Good fizzy carbonation and a crisp, dry, carbonated smooth light bodied mouthfeel.

Delicious tasting, rum cake malty, a good rum spiciness, caramelized sugary, sweet baked apples and figs fruitiness, the alcohol is spicy and provides a nice warmth in the palate and a dry, sweet spicy, fig and bread malty finish, excellent Belgian drinkability, very quaffable for a strong ale.

2866,"2006-07-08",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2007 It is hard to write about the Trappistes 8, because everything that can be said about it has already been said.  Its notoriety has elevated it to an exalted position for most avid American drinkers.  Its plentiful, available and sacred by origin.  Flavor complexity and an apparent capriciousness have given the Rochefort Trappistes 8, and its brewery a well deserved reputation for mystique and sedulousness.  For these reasons, and countless others, the Rochefort series (10, 8, 6) have been well discussed.  No remark I could make would be new, no clever repartee would be witty, no observation would be astute.  This does not, however, deprive me of the power of emphasis.  With my writers hands tied Im left to comment on what readers have said before, combing through their reviews and picking out the most verisimilous ones.  To this task I will choose one: temperature.  The Rochefort 8 is a fine example of brewing art; a dimly glowing harvest moon brown head slowly morphing atop a dusty, antique wood brown body.  The smell is begat from apples, oak, smoke, flowers, mist, star anise, blackberries, butter and cinnamon  a comparatively full roster.  The taste is equally profound, replete with bananas, chopped nuts, espresso and hazelnut, all within an overarching grand cacophony of toasted and roasted malts.  The key to this flavor, one unlike anything Ive had before, is the temperature.  Before its allowed to flux to room temperature the Rochefort 8 is a tongue numbing rake of roasted malts.  Mellowing slowly wins the heart of this beers true flavor, uncovering richer and enigmatic tones of flavor.  Give it a sip when its still cold, but dont let your reaction give way to early and unfair judgment.  A little cooking to room temperature and suddenly the Rochefort 8 blossoms into a brew worthy of its reputation.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Laces gorgeously, is playfully fluffy, and is full enough...well, is full enough to bounce a few quarters.  Pours a dark brown.  Nose is sweetly malty, with dried fruit (mostly berry), yeast, spice, and caramel.  Really, not the most complex aroma in the world, but certainly among the most beautiful.  Taste is otherworldly.  Soft and luscious, slightly sweet, loooads of malt.  Slight chocolate, more red berry.  Strong spice is evident toward the end, as is the barely-there alcohol.  Still, extremely full-bodied, a stream of oil amidst the cream.  A hint of cloves.  Soft and velvety.  And there is even a nice hoppy swallow.  Quite an experience!

Nose is dark and figgy, very little toffee; burnt raisins flambéed in rum; dates and faint banana, light phenols and alcohol; very richly malty with sweet red fruit in the bg; pretty perfect and style-defining aroma.  Pours deep, dark garnet with a huge and noisy oily-soapy beige head that fades quickly.  Taste starts sweet with the lovely strong honey-candy character of the 6, lightly floral with marshmallow and vanilla; goes through singed caramel with deeper fig and date, faint grape and cherry, light mineral contribution and spice.  Some orange peel,  light lavender, very mild alcohol (stunning how well-integrated it is!) which reminds of high-quality gin.  Ultra-smooth medium body, light caress of warmth and oil from the booze.  I cant help but marvel at how much more vibrant and alive these last two bottles of Rochefort have been; maybe the bottles I had 8.75 years ago had been sitting on a shelf for too long? Despite its size, this one seems somehow smaller, and very digestible (I dare say dry!); its a sipper that doesnt wear on the palate, and despite my wolfish celerity Im surprised at how much remains in the bottle -- as if this were the famed ""süßer Brei!""

2866,"2006-06-12",4.4,"A beautiful deep ruby-brown pour with lovely lace in a large cream-colored head.  Amazing head for the ABV.  A decidedly Belgian aroma, hop spice, malt, not as much sweetness as expected, yet intriguingly complex.  As I taste, a soft velvety light dry balance in the palate.  Flavor is nutty and hop spices with a slight malt character.  Complex, very nice. Drier that Ive had in this style before.  Lingering floral bouquet and malts in the aftertaste.  Do NOT drink too cold, this one gets better and better as it warms.","Centennial, Colorado, USA","segfault"

2866,"2006-06-11",4.6,"I hadnt had a beer in a few days when I cracked this one open for dinner this evening (I had some other stuff for dinner too-- less important stuff).  I was blown away.  Every now and again youll have a beer, the first sip of which will just make you stop and think, hey, this is why I drink beer.  This was certainly one of those beers.  The complexity of flavor meshed perfectly with the beers mouthfeel, and appearance.  I tasted everything from plum and cherry to some chocolate and nuttiness, even to some candy sweetness (I think this was probably induced by the higher alcohol content).  The beer is a fantastic nut brown color, with a head that lasts to the very end.  The beer has a pleasant, tart finish which mellows as the beer warms.  The carbonation is understated, and the alcohol is what really dominates the palate (not in a bad way though).  Belgian beer is not beer to be pounded day in and day out like folks drink Pabst or even some of the stronger american ales.  In fact, Id say, these stronger Belgians are MUCH better if you only have one every month or so.  It makes you appreciate the flavor (which is strong and ultra-complex) a lot more than you would otherwise.  In other words, its great beer, but Ill probably only drink one bottle of belgian strong ale for every ten or fifteen bottles of other beers.  Thats all it takes.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Fish"

2866,"2006-04-18",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2016 4/18/06: Pours a very dark, yet not opaque brown amber.  A huge light khaki head slowly dissipates and sticks along the way down for a nice lacing. Aroma is yeaty and spicy.  Much like the 10, this is incredibly complex.  Initial bitterness leads quickly into an array of dark fruits, maybe most prevelently plums.  Also banana.  Black licorice flavor was suprising and pleasant.  A great spicyness leads into a soft bitterness in the finish.  Light mouthfeel is accompanied by soft yet lively carbonation.  Once again, a fanatstic brew from the Trappists.  Almost as good as the 10, but Im still partial.  Still one of the best Ive ever had.

Aroma is malty, with alcohol, raisins, candi sugar and cocoa. Sweet, malty flavor with warming alcohol, raisins and bitterness. Full to medium body and a finish with alcohol and lasting bitterness. Its a shame this classic costs almost $8 in Norway. Rating: 8-5-8-4-17-4.2. 060218Bottle, BB 130813. Wauw! I really love the smell when pouring this one, always putting my face right above the glass when pouring. Prunes, cellar, dried apricots, alcohol, some roasted malts and yeast and even more dried fruits, and a lovely tobacco-like spicyness escapes the glass. When finished, at least for a while, sniffing the beer, I see a wonderful creamy, two-finger thick, beige head on top of an unclear, brown body. The head stays, and leaves some pretty lacings as the beer goes down my throat. In the mouth its full-bodied and warming, silky smooth and quite carbonated, but not feeling fizzy at any level. The flavor is sweet and malty, filled with dried fruits and some spicyness. Dried apricots, rum raisin and prunes at least. Theres some bitterness as well, and that cellar and yeast found in the aroma are also chiming in. Some peppery notes also finds its way down the throat. The finish is of the lasting kind, warming, sweet yet dry, bitter, lightly roasted and spiced, and with a lovely peppery touch in the very end. I have to admit I was really in the mood for a good Belgian tonight, and I knew this one would live up to my wishes. In that light my rating might be too high, but right now its worth every point.

The aroma is predominantly of vine fruit and alcohol (rum n raisin?), and masses of fruit. I can sense ripe banana, pears and figs. There are also hints of cherries, plums and molasses - the aroma rich and dark. 

Its full-bodied with a smooth-as-silk, yet bubbly mouthfeel that is very easy to drink. Big and malty, the taste has all sorts of complexity. There are bread flavours, some mild coffee, and a little bit of toffee. As with the aroma, fruit makes its presence felt in a big way with apples, pears and vine fruit being the most prominent, but there are some vague traces of more tropical fruit. Its phenolic, even slightly medicinal, with a hint of cloves to add a spicy touch to the sweet-ish finish.

2866,"2006-01-09",4.7,"Bottle. Pours an opaque cloudy brown that only lets a little light through. Roughly the color of dark  toffee with a good off white head, which looks very creamy. Lacing in the side of the glass is super consistent and hangs around for a good long while. Aroma of grapefruit, pear, strawberry. Dandelion? Perhaps. Flavor very malty, with heavy caramel and toffee notes, and slightly nutty. Like peanut brittle. Strawberry, pear, rosewater also in there somewhere. Finishes with creamy caramel, roasted coffee, carnation, hazelnut. Body is about what I expect out of a good porter, but the malty bubbliness actually makes it feel ice-creamy. Melted root beer float, perhaps. Warms the chest nicely without making the face ht. Holy crap this is good. May not be a complex as the 10, but a much more pleasant experience overall. This one just tastes better than the 10 in my opinion. Wonderful. Almost as good as Orval. Go monks.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","FistFullOfCats"

Rich, roasted malt aroma with a very pronounced yeastiness.  This is another beer I could simply smell for an hour or so; it seems to have many different subtleties and they even seem to change around a bit.  The taste is somewhat spicy, somewhat roasty, somewhat floral, somewhat nutty, somewhat minty and somewhat sweet.  Very dry finish.","Concord, California, USA","ChillCoat"

Medium bodied that starts with light malt sweetness, peppery alcohol and slight medicinal (adhesive bandage) flavors. Finishes dry with light malt aftertaste.

2866,"2006-01-01",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2013 Fresh bottle 1/1/06.
Pours a murky dark red-brown with a lovely fine and long-lasting light-brown head. The aroma is honey, molassas, lightly toasted almonds, and a hint of pineapple. The flavor is brown sugar, oak, plums, kiwi, and slight spice, with a smooth bitter finish. The mouthfeel is luxurious, amply carbonated, almost like cognac without the alcohol burn (this beer hides its 9% well). My only complaint is that it goes a bit thin as the beer warms and the carbonation departs. 8/4/9/4/16

Rerate 11/7/13. Pours into my Koningshoeven goblet in a caramel brown with a fluffy contoured pillowy head and a reasonable amount of sand-grain-sized sediment. Cotton candy in the aroma with fruitcake and spice. Spicy flavor as well -- something akin to ginger and cinnamon -- cola flavors, modest but not overpowering sweetness drying out late. Smooth, creamy mouthful hiding the high ABV until it warms the back of ones throat. This one is without technical flaw, but it really feels to me as if it is holding something back. Probably not one to buy on a regular basis; there are other classic Belgians that I prefer (de Dolle, Im looking at you). Id going to drop the rating to 4.0 though Id have gone 3.9 or even 3.8 on this bottle right after finishing it. That said, an interesting thing happens when I open a Rochefort 10 immediately following this one. The big boozy sweet 10 makes me suddenly appreciate the absence of alcohol in the nose and the dry finish of this one. The 4.0 is deserved after all.   7/4/8/5/15

2866,"2005-12-08",4.8,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2006 Re-rate:- Earlier bottle (21/03/09) making it god knows how old. Speckled chestnut-brown body with a tight, creamy tan head that laced a wicked pattern over the glass. Aroma was similar, but it was much richer in the mouth, almost treacly smooth and well in control flavour-wise. Very earthy, almost nutty and woody with a rich loam top soil flavour to add complexity atop layers of gritty bitter/sweet chocolate and staling musty hops. This is still a pleasure to drink. Long, well rounded, meticulously brewed. Firkin lovely. Look forward to my next. AHHHH, I could be St. Remys biggest fan as far as their enchanting beers go! Absolute enjoyment, its taken several bottles over several months just to rate it. Poured into its own chalice, around cellar temperature. Deep, chestnut brown; its thick yeast pack dispersing at the end of pouring making it opaque and muddy. Across the glass the very, very fine carbonation raised slowly towards a dense, creamy 1"" tan head that remained in its place for the length and left intricately patterned lace down the sides. Rich, yet quite controlled, deep, dark fruit nose reminiscent of aged figs, plums and savoury sultanas. Lightly, bready with a feint roundness of bitter/sweet chocolate and a touch of brandy. Lightly spicy, the inviting aroma preceded each sip perfectly. In the mouth it drifts from the enticing aroma, taking my palate in a new direction, a new journey. Intensely spicy, rich and yet dry flavours of cocoa, prunes, cinnamon and light clove-like spice. Warming alcohol towards the back mingles with pleasantry amongst herbal and grassy, bitter hops before a long, dry and thickly malty swallow. So smooth, it had the mouthfeel of Irish cream Liqueur with the kick to go with it. Liquid bread, nicely balanced and a treat for the senses. Like its bigger and shorter brother this was exceptional.

Superior balance of the all the candy dish, raisin, cedary  aromas and the the enticing carmelized brown sugar platform (not as a fermentable thought).  For the abbot rather than the brothers.  This bottle shows some rather refreshing hoppiness hand in hand with a slight spice.  Rochefort being the only Trappist brewery to commercially release a beer spiced with anything, coriander here.   As always, this beer is balanced and seamless from introduction on.  The abv. strength is well hidden as the malt sweetness forms a velvet glove around a bourbon ""sour mash,"" tanginess.

Gum candy could be felt, and dark malts, and some berry coated in brown sugar, even some lemon could be felt in the last few sips. EVen this lovely herbal yet fruity taste I identified in Orval as aloe vera is there. Alcohol is well hidden, and what little could be felt actually improved the taste.

Im greeteed by predominantly earthy aromas accompanied by prunes or dates, cherries, flowers, yeast, gingerbread, and bubblegum wrapper. Inside, I meet a blur of flavors: walnut, fruit (plum, rum-raisin, gooseberry?, orange gumdrops), and wood. Everpresent ethanol hovers nearby, and confettis my head with fuzzy static. Shy candied citrus and anise peek from the background. I sip the secret liquid, and her pangaean lace veil discretely lava-lamps into eldritch foam amoebas. Her touch is fluffy, cottony on my tongue; an alcohol snowflake. The abrupt farewell is bone dry, spicily bitter, peppery, and strongly tannic.

Taste is very strong, nipping the back of the throat with the potency of cutting-sharp hops and alcohol. After the initial crack comes sweet pit fruits, brown sugar, which fades to a more subtle roasted malt, dried orange peel, drying hops, and a bit of anise. Alcohol really dries things out, lingers for quite awhile. As I said, a very strong beer, however the body is actually rather thin. It does contain a healthy bit of carbonation that turns into tiny bubbles on the tongue, helping the flavors permeate even more. But it is thin, not thick or oily as I might have expected, to translate this much flavor. All flavors mesh well, nothing out of place. Well crafted beer here, could drink on it all night.","Cochabamba, BOLIVIA","JonR888710"

Anticipated carbonation tingles like seltzer on a mustache.  Dry chocolate quality evolves into specialty chocolate covered prunes.  One of the more impressive spicing displays, with phenols stemming from pepper, poppy seeds, cloves and a small scattering of nutmeg.  A little loose in body but nothing too distracting, while it favors dryness to creaminess, making the flavor seem depleted at times.

I noticed dark chocolate, roasted caramel, yeast along with some fruity notes that remind of plums, prunes and red wine.  The experience is very reminescent of the 10 but more airy and open. The balance touches perfection. A velvety creaminess first soothes the tongue with a slight tingle from the mild carbonation. As you begin to ""chew"" the liquid, the body reveals itself: smooth roasted malts and the distinctive ""Rochefort"" flavor.

This has a great taste that isnt too overpowering or have a sting that would represent its true alcohol content. Very complex, with true Belgian ale flavor and a wonderful ""Coca Cola-like"" color.

A very light aroma compared to its big bro #10.  Taste is also a bit lighter and dare I say more enjoyable then the #10.  This is a beer that is high in alcohol but doesnt let you know that it is.  Tastes of dark fruit, raisins, green grape, malt,  and a bit of wood.  The green grape is more apparent in the finish as it warms over the tongue.  Very complex but enjoyable.

2866,"2005-06-08",4.1,"Sampled the spectacular Westvleteren 8 last night and it edges this fine 8 from Rochefort. However, Im going to commit heresy by saying that neither quite matched Achel 8 Bruin IMHO. This poured a teak colour with a tight, prodigious tan head that left great reefs of lacework as it receded. The aroma is fairly restrained for the 9.2% abv. Its malt-driven and yeasty with a dash of nose-prickling alcohol, a hint of espresso and grape bubblegum. The mouthfeel is briefly fizzy, fading to a smooth, almost oily texture that slides down beautifully. The last bottle of the 10 that I tasted seemed over-carbonated but this is perfect. There are delicious intense Christmas flavours in there - raisins, nuts, port and cinammon - before that big warming dry finish. As with many ales above 8%, I find the finish a touch phenolic, but thats a minor criticism. Another outstanding ale from Rochefort.

The amazing thing is from how far away you can pick up the scent.  Tasting begins a lengthy trek on the palate.  Only after you drink down the sharp, carbonated, somewhat malty beer do you begin to really TASTE it.  Yeast, smooth hops of dark fruit, nutty and caramel malts, and a coffee-like finish.  I would time the finish, but after several minutes, I want another sip so badly I never seem to reach the end.  A stand-alone strong ale that surpassed my expectations.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","jefcon"

2866,"2005-05-31",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 26, 2005 Necessary re-rate for fresher product, in tumbler, slightly cooled. This is much better if you dont stun it in a fridge for 5 years. Deep sugary/malty flavor imbued with dried dark fruit, nice dry edge of hops and alcohol. Still an austere, demanding beer but not one unrewarding. The 24 case I got is actually better then the last sixer I picked up, so there is a real batch inconsistency - the latter six are more harshly dry/exposed alcohol and lack depth, body and balance, overall unpleasant! Rating is for better examples. <P>5 year old bottle hisses open with slight vinegar aroma that quickly dissipate. Free of much suspended particles this Rochefort pours almost clear tea brown. Tan, fine bubble head and ample, sustained carbonation. Aroma is not so intense, a touch estery. Taste peppery, slight citric bite over some dark dried fruits. Warming alcohol feel. Full flavored but by no means a sweet Belgian at this stage! Firm malt/hop structure underpinned by assertive but controlled alcohol presence. Long sustained malty finish tempered with smoothly attenuated hop presence. Grain... caramel.... dry yet supple. So this is what a matured Trappist may taste like. Powerful aroma on the sediment I later rinse from the bottle - I would rate this 8 very differently were it not so settled out (and had more unruly young flavors present.)

The beer has a sweetish aroma of dark fruit (raisins. plums), some spiciness (almost peppery), vanilla, and some mysterious bright notes. The mouthfeel is huge and it is the first thing you notice when you take a sip of the beer. The taste is fruity and mildly chocolaty with a dry, slightly bitter finish that keeps it from being cloying. There is a touch of alcohol at the finish when it warms up quite a bit. I poured the remainder into the glass and neither the aroma, appearance, or flavor changed, but I did find some ground pepper sized particles at the bottom of the glass. This is tasty, but a bit underwhelming. This tastes more like what I would imagine the table beer for the monks to drink than the not-so-little brother of the wonderful Rochefort 10.

Beer was a murky tea brown, with a few yeast floaties present.  Aroma was pleasantly malty and full of caramel, with just a wisp of alcohol to remind you of its strength.  Taste was a composite of malty sweetness, mixed with warming alcohol; the end is surprisingly bitter - but I was not sure if this was due to yeast bite or hops.

I can smell the dark fruit waft my way out of my Ommegang Trappist glass.  I could smell this all day.  Definite barleywine essence on the nose.  Fruity, boozy, prickly on the tongue.  Very complex, just a hint of skunkiness in the end.  I am gonna let this warm a little...whew!  The skunkiness went away, and the complexity doubled.

2866,"2005-02-21",4.5,"So I finally located the only store in Freakville that carries more than a couple of the esoteric top 50 beers, and at great expense purchased this example (as well as the Rochefort 10) of the Trappists art.  Not being in possesion of a Rochefort glass, I chose a gold rimmed Koningshoven trappist glass in which to do the honors.  Deep orange brown pour with a creamy head that fizzes up and then recedes, upon which I am treated to a delightful aroma of fruity booze.  The flavor is striking and unlike any other beer I have encountered thus far.  Extremely deep and complex with even the first sip.  Light in the mouth with tingly sparkling carbonation, yet chewy with rich dark fruit flavors. Spices and herbal flavors go everywhere and defy description. The 9.2% alcohol does not detract at all, but adds to the complexity and fullness of the brew.  You can always recognise a winner, and here we have one.  Definitely not an everyday beer, but Awesome!","Orange Park, Florida, USA","yayforbeer"

2866,"2005-01-24",4.0,"This is a classic example of everything that a Belgian can do right, but it falls marginally behind its big brother, the Rochefort 10. Not too much of a complaint though, because these are among the two best beers out there. Unfortunately, neither is readily available in Toronto, but occasionally Ill come across one.

Talk about racking ones brain. Was drinking this while listening to a Guided by Voices. phew! Nice big murky brown body. Nice creamy head. Flavours that hit you are roasted coffee, chocolate, some nasal opening aromatic taste....(did they pour Amol into this too?

The nose has a real vanilla hit with a pleasant mellow chocolate coated plum. Once again, a bit harsh in the first instance but this settles well.  While doing this rating I looked back at the one for the 10 and found that it rated highly but there was a concern about the monstrous 11.3% of that one. At the ABV of this one it certainly is a monster too, but a little bit more manageable. Truly delightful beer that once again demonstrates that there must be a God.

The aroma is like one of those rarities, a good holiday fruit cake, dark fruits and candied fruits with a hint of malt to hold it together.  This is very soft in the mouth.

Pours a beautiful mahoganey brown with medium, creamy head.  I left the big chunks in the bottle this time, but I have four more bottles to experiment with later.  Aroma is chewy and vinous, port wine, raisin and rum, infused dark fruits.  Damn, this beer is all fruit and booze...I think Im in love.  Flavor is big and chocolatey and raisiny and deeply port-ish and luscious and more cocoa powder and hits of white pepper.  At the instant of the sip, the body feels unfortunately wet, watery almost, with a graininess to the texture; but that all goes away as the beer settles and smooths out over the palate.  Certainly not as soft as a quad, but still very nice, more refreshing.  Alcohol is certianly present but never over steps its bounds.  Monks rule.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

Crispy mouthfeel, yet lots of malt ""substance"" - assertive.  Complex sweet flavours with sharp hop bite at the end.

Incredibly fresh cookie or gingerbread dough, with loads of spices (definitely allspice and cinnamon but a few others I couldnt quite pick out), orange peel and whatever they use to spice Hahn Witbier and Emersons Taieri George. Theres jasmine and other floral, perfumey stuff in the background. More fresh doughy flavours, though it is very light and lean in the mouth. Loads of spice flavours coming from all directions, fresh but light maltiness, light bitterness and alcohol with a touch of chocolate in the finish but it sure doesnt seem like its 9%. I found it a touch too fizzy early on and whilst it was really good, it was perhaps a touch too light on malt flavours to be my ultimate Belgian. Onya beer_ledgend!

The other side of me wants to quaff it down because it is so fuckin delish.This one goes in my book as near godly status. Every bit worth the $.
 Re rate based on several sub avg bottles and the one I wish I could be enjoying now. The looks and aroma have not really changed. The aroma on this one is actually sweeter than past bottles. It started out with a nice mix of chocolate and dark dried fruits but the finish(again) killed it. Like someone had used my glass as a spitoon or for old cigar butts. Ill pass from now on,too inconsistant.","Lake Zurich, Illinois, USA","Metalhead"
2866,"2004-09-27",3.5,"I am a big fan of Roc No 10 and was actually disappointed with this beer. It has a strange and strong aroma with hints of medicin, herbs, jougurt and malt - all though strange, impressive! It has a muddy body without no clear collor! The taste is a bit sour, bitter and vinous with hints of malt, nuts and plums. Burns a bit, and the taste of alc is a bit dominant. A good beer, but nothing compared to No. 10!","KBH K, DENMARK","Mathis"

Best before 27 12 12; Tasted December 12, 2009:  This one started odd.  Never had a Trappist beer start do the slow-mo gusher routine.  My surprise was compounded by the first pour, which had the consistancy of a milkshake.  The bottle hadnt been moved in a year, so how all the freaking yeast got stirred up like I played a soccer game with the bottle, I have no idea.  Cloudy brown color with a meidum head that fades immediately.  Massive sediment.  Aroma of Munich malt, caramel, brown sugar and a bit of biscuit character.  Taste is really odd... The rum, molasses and caramel would suggest that Id love this beer to death.  The carbonation like Champagne, cooked veggies and celery indicate this was actually brewed by the moronic brew pub in the backwoods that thinks adding brown food coloring to sewer water makes it beer.  Ive never been more turned off by a Trappist, including my hate-accept-loathe relationship with Orval.  It gets one more try... 7/2/6/2/14","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"

The aroma is refreshing, though not very unusual, with a strong malt and spice presence.  Initial taste is very balanced spice and malt.  The body is full and very-well carbonated (i.e. a good carbonation presence without overdoing it).  Amazingly, the taste soon turns to sweet in your mouth and then disappears, leaving behind an extremely clean finish.

Pounds and pounds of flavor! Is it supposed to be a Tripel? The strength and the rather firm, full texture are a drawback to drinkability.
Other drawback is that the only place Ive been able to buy this was in a wine shop that overprices and undersells its quality beer. It was in a clearance bin, marked down. Maybe a better cared for bottle would have tasted differently?","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

2866,"2004-07-26",4.2,"7/26/04.  Poured out of 330 mL bottle, bought at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA 7/25/04.  Pours a murky dark red-brown with wonderfully fluffy, dense cream-colored head.  Lacing is tight and sticks like a web.  Superb.  Aroma is lovely as well-- rich cake, figs, syrup, only lightly alcoholic.  First taste reveals some of that subdued alcohol, a clovey and sort of cinnamon/nutmeg dry spiced quality, a touch of cocoa powder, and a bit of a foggy, smoky (tobacco?), cakey dark fruit flavor; but theres also a somewhat cloying sweetness that creeps in around the back.  Otherwise itd be very subtle and very drinkable.  I just wish I could nip that cloying edge.  Full body with a nicely drying, chewy palate.  A bit sticky at the same time.  Long finish, and I love that hint of cooca, but I hate the oversweetness that threats to take over.  Very nice to feel in the mouth, still.  Its a damn shame.  But its still damn good.  I think I even like it more than the 10 at this young stage, because its much more drinkable and still richly complex and delicious.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

The head was about an inch in height and died down pretty quickly.  There was a generous amount of lace on the sides of the glass.  The aroma was sweet-sour with cherries, licorice, molasses, and Belgian horse blanket smells wafting through.  The taste was a balance between dark skinned dried fruits and dry peppery spiciness.  The malt exhibited a roasty burnt quality, but not to a degree found in a stout or a porter.  A more pronounced hop bitterness than that typically found in Belgian strong ales was also detectable.  The beer was medium thick on the palette, and never felt watered down compared to its bigger and bolder brethren.  This is one masterful brew thanks to those Trappist monks.  If they did not require celibacy, Id have joined the order a long time ago.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

""yes, yes, it IS!"" you slurp it loudly and languorously over the tongue like the wine tasters do-- to savor every molecule of encapsulated trappist wisdom-- and still you curse yourself for selfishly swallowing it.  another dollars worth is gone... and so it goes. a tug of war to carefully catalogue the intricacies versus the overwhelming impulse to drain it away. amazing. where else will you smell cranberry and chocolate in the same sniff? its the very deffinition of complexity in a masterful libation: few essences are overbearing, and nearly any taste can be offered as a reasonable discriptor: mint and raisin? sure.  haunting verisimilitudes weave in and out: ""was that mustard and cheddar?  hmmm, maybe... plum jam and peasant bread? yes. bourbon and lemon tea? honeycomb and cedarwood?  yes. all of the above"". peppery chunks of yeast settle out like buckshot; carbonation is the gently roiling air upon which the butterflys of flavor can play, this ale is milky textured and sweet with moderate bitterness.  the alcohol dots the is and crosses the ts, and ultimately crosses your eyes as well, and by the time you get to four dollars fifty cents worth, youve tossed aside the notes and given in to the hypnotic flow of flavors. sweet dreams.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"

Key differences:  1) Kept me slightly more sober to write this review. 2) Seemed more carbonated and lively on the palate 3) More hint of red in the hue  4)Seemed to have been even more ""ripe"" (fruits have mellowed in flavor and heightened in aroma), as this sample was 5 months older than the ""10"" tasted previously.  This ""8"" has the highest production at Rochefort, and I can see why.  A product worth driving to get (in my case, nearly 400 miles to Lexington KY).

2866,"2004-03-23",4.3,"Served at room temperature.  Very effervescent, poured with a fizzy white head that settled down into a few wisps on top of a dark amber beer.  Aroma and taste are very complex.  At first I thought it was not very good, but after a few sips it built on me and I quickly changed my mind.  Initial taste is that of dried fruit, something like a prune/date/fig/raisin, followed up pretty quickly by some moderate bitterness/burn that  then quickly changes back into fruitness that slowly fades into the back of your mouth.  Full body.  One to enjoy sipping on as the flavors gradually change as the glass warms in your hand.  

Serving temp and how you taste it will definitly have an impact onyour enjoyment of this beer.  A small sip that can barely touch your tongue will leave a much different impression form one that you let run across your cheeks, teeth, gums and most importantly all of your tongue.","montvale, New Jersey, USA","ruffian"

2866,"2004-03-08",3.9,"BB 2008.  Very drab dark chestnut brown with plenty of greys and lighter yellows.  Big foamy off-white head.  Served quite warm, 53-55 degrees.  Bottle conditioned.  Aroma of sweet dates, rum raisins and some faint hops? or perhaps that's just the yeast.  Aroma fairly faint overall.  Begins extremely delicate, walnuts, green raisins and a touch of chocolate.  Body has some lively effervesence and finish ends on a nice yeasty bite.  Texture of English soda bread.  Body very restrained and a good medium.  Light candied sugars throughout, some plant/root flavors and alcohol is quite apparent on the finish while warm.  This seems more of a dubbel, though perhaps a bit more hops and yeast apparency.  Anyways, much better than Westmalle dubbel in my book, and a step up in complexity from New Belgium's Abbey.  Fine stuff.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Plum, raisin, clove and black pepper obvious in the nose at first pass.  Taste is fairly alcoholic (maybe because of age), but it's not unbalanced as a result like some others.  I get some light candi sugar, caramel, and warm spices.  Slightly bready with a long warm finish.  Not nearly as complex as the 10 I had earlier this year, but then I shouldn't have expected it to be.  Still a fantastic beer.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

Light tan head, brown, deep garnet color when held up to light.  Aroma of raisins, figs, hint of cherry, and a light spiciness that includes notes of allspice, mace, and that spice that is cherry like.  First taste so well integrated, and so intensely tasty, that I am glad that this is not like the last one that I had.  The taste is redolent of bright fig notes, subtle spiciness, raisins, and  a hint of cherry like acidity.  It sort of reminds me of a rich hearty German black bread that is rich with notes of molasses.  Also there are some very smooth, subtle notes of the finest rums.  This is just so well integrated, so smooth, and so tasty.
Expiration Date April 2008, Sampled January 2004Pours a beautiful ruby color.  It is vry highly carbonated, which creates a thick creamy light brown-tan head.  Aromas of dark fruit, rum, a certain spiciness, faintly musty, and alcolohol are all to be found in the nose.  The taste is lightly sweet up front and finishes with a kick of alcohol.  This beer has a light body considering the strength (as is characteristic of many Belgian beers), though it is perhaps is on the thin side.  This beer does not even come close to the character & depth of either the 6 or the 10 from Rochefort.  A bit dissapointing really.  There is some dark fruitiness in the taste, but it is somewhat muted, and there is a musty, perhaps wet cardboard, flavor, which makes me think that perhaps this beer has been mistreated.  I can't quite place it as oxidation damage though.  This beer should be strong enough to shrug off any rough treatment it recieves during importation though.  I will definitely have to try another sample later for a rerate.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Flavors include chocolate, big fat ripe black cherries, figs, raisins, wood and varnish. The body is big, chewy and loaded with flavor and texture. This beer is downright native.

If it weren't for a fast fading head it would recieve a 5 for sure, but it crumpled away pretty darn quick, it looked impressive for about 2 seconds, big, fluffy, dark ivory in color, leaves a skim and lace is in stringy patches that doesn't last either.

Aroma is quite complex of dark fruits and has a quality close to a dark wine, very rich & lush, alcohol is lightly present, I get mostly plum and figs, with notes mixing with raisins, banana, with a nice caramel candied sweetness of yummy malts with a bit of nuttyness in there as well, excellent subtlities in this nose.

Taste is super smooth and silky, a nice creamy sensation comes through right away, flows right in and starts laying down complex malts of caramel sweetness, toffee, and nuts, with a huge rich fruityness mixing in of banana bread, figs, raisins, and nice little light kick of spice hinting in a dark mandorine orange peel or similar to some kind of citrus peel, cloves maybe too? The alcohol makes a slight hindering towards the end. But especially after you get about half way through, head swimmingly goodness, ooooh yeah. One nice complex and subtle brew, amazing to think this is beer.

2866,"2003-06-15",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2003 Bottle #2:
Dark brown with a prominent ruby tint. Dense light-tan head, fairly thin. Very musty aroma of pit fruit, malt, raisins, caramel and a slight spiceyness. Medium-bodied; Very carbonated; Inital strong flavours, fades quickly into a subtle taste. Aftertaste shows the musty character as well as some sweetness. Overall, a nicer nose than the first bottle, just lacking in taste a bit to me. Values for this rating: 9,4,7,3,15.

Bottle #1:
Hazy dark brown in colour with a very nice small-bubbled tan head. The smell is very sweet, ripe fruit and sugar dominate the aroma and make your mouth water. This one smells a lot less malty than Rochefort 10, which in my book would be a good thing. The taste is very fruity, but also very malty. The carbonation lingers on the tongue for quite a while and at the same time some other flavours (yeast & spices) linger on the palate. This beer is pretty similar to Rochefort 10 aside from the smell, with this having a little less malt overload and more fruity complexity. As 'hotstuff' said, I prefer Westy 12 to either Rochefort 10 or 8. A good beer, but not the best...in my books, that still belongs to Westy 12.

Re-rate 2004: I had to re-rate this beer when I had it at the Greenwich in Brussels.

2866,"2003-05-28",4.8,"This beer was something of a surprise. The aroma was splendid with the hops coming through very pleasingly. The appearance was marred not by the beautiful head but the white floaties found in the dark beer after pouring. Beware when you enjoy yours, leave some behind and pour completely. If you don't let the white floaties bother your palate... I don't, then you'll find the flavor to be one of the most pleasing, complexities you've ever experienced. The malty, coffee hints of this strong ale do such a great job of giving exceptional character to this relatively high ABV beer. The sweetness can get in the way at times if you don't care for lingering sweets. Some inexperienced American brewers get the high alcohol but it ends up tasting that way. Not with this fine Belgian example of a great strong ale. If you like this GO FOR THE WESTVLETEREN! It only gets better.","West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA","plalo"

The aroma hits with a grainy goodness like fresh cooked homemade bread straight out of the oven with a fresh steaming cup of coffee on the side, but in way that makes you want to stick your face straight into it. The dance that executes across the tounge is amazing. This is no mere beer; this is a masterpiece. A finely crafted delicate dance of malt, yeast, and hops that emphasizes none before the other, but combines them in a refined balance of spice and caramel mellowness.

The body is not too thin, as some sugars are still present, but the flavor lacks of depth, there is just some simple caramel, and the total lack of bitterness accentuates that; the alcohol feeling is evident; somehow it developed a mild metallic trait.Still, for a 15 years old beer its much better than expected.2016-07-14,  bb 071216, 5 years old, 6-4-6-2-12=30Highly carbonated, huge head; as a result, the body is very thin, already visible while pouring; tired malts flavor, and an oxidisation level that I would quantify as ""50%"".Too old, nothing like it should be when at its best.2013-02-19,L 220715, 2½ years old, 8-4-8-3-16=39Clear dark mahogany color with generous frothy head, well carbonated. Nice aroma of caramel with a earthy (soil) touch, light spices, very light yeast. Soft mouthfeel, the body starts to thin; very good malt and caramel flavor, with light nuttiness, low bitterness, and comforting alcohol feeling. In the final there is some rare sweetness, a fine spicy touch, and a shade of oxidization.Mature, very good.2013-02-12, L 060606, 11½ years old, 7-4-7-3-15=36Chestnut color, with small sized head, not as compact. Mild aroma, caramel and light honey. Lean body, with some caramel flavor, very low residual sweetness, almost absent bitterness, some alcohol, very light fruity touch.Apparently the last sugars have been fermented; its a simple version of the original beer, still pleasant and with just minimal signs of Madeirization.Should be drank with the yeast deposit that increases the mouthfeel and provides very light final astringency (one point extra).2011-08-30, L 100215 10:17, 1½ years old, 8-5-7-4-15=39The aroma is almost cheesy, with brown sugar, caramel. The body is lean; there is caramel flavor, with moderate sweetness, and light liquorice impression; apparently its not mature enough. Low bitterness, and light alcohol perception too. Lacking of depth.2011-05-03, L 220715 10:38, 1 year old, 7-4-7-3-14=35Its overly carbonated, it pours a gigantic head. Initially there is some yeast smell; later followed by the expected caramel. Having lost most of the carbonation, the mouthfeel is quite soft, but the body is thinner than expected; good flavor, some malt and caramel, maybe with too much accent on the oxidization; traces of liquorice. The bitterness is already quite low, and the final is rather weak. Good Belgian, but nothing special (yet).2011-02-25, L 200912 10:30, 4 years old, 8-5-8-3-16=40Very dark brown color; generous head, reducing to a thinner layer, compact and persistent. The aroma is unusually spicy, peppery, with some malt and caramel, and Chinotto (a special citrus fruit from Liguria). The mouthfeel is very smooth (because of the initial high carbonation), then round (a bit later); there is a good flavor of malt and caramel, with clear spicy side; correct bitterness.

Correct bitterness. Too old.2003-05-08, 8-5-9-4-17=43Dark amber color. Aroma of malt, bread, candi sugar, lightly fruity (strawberries).

2866,"2002-12-19",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2014 Where and how:  LCBO, bottle 330 ml
Aroma quiet Belgian, softer than most. Floral, hint of vanilla, red apple and chamomile. Molasses with herbal hops. Rounded with Belgian phenolic yeast vibe.
 Appearance :
Top: large lasting tanned cap, rings with lace.
Base: hazy amber.
Palate :  medium bodied with lighter but not this walls. Nice bite to it (top end). 
Taste: wow. One of those ""wow"" beers. Seemingly just solid and after second you will realize that this is no ordinary Belgian. Soft with bubbly dryness. Silky texture with prickly heat of alcohol. All in perfect balance.
 Other notes  who says you need bold beer to be top notch?
2002 review 
Another great classic that I had chance of trying tonight. The aroma was friendly to me, slightly warm. Outside was getting dark, Christmas lights were on. The cloudy amber type look, the white head on the top, the snow outside on the street. Flavour was full of intensivity, full of complexity. There was some bitterness, some marzipan sweetness. You could notice some dry fruits as well. Very complex yet specific. Overall nicely balanced.","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"
2866,"2002-12-15",4.5,"When pouring this beer in my glass the aroma is strong and heavy, fruits, sweet and chocolate, a beautifull head develops which remains till the beer has vanished into my body. I noticed that while drinking, the beautifull head actually cleans the glass. Remarkable...The taste is definately good, but certainly not as complex as its big brother, the number 10. Though its well balanced just like the 10. Sweet taste, alchol well masked, just in the finished its better noticed. palate could be better. Overall great!","Baarn, NETHERLANDS","skortila"
2866,"2002-12-12",4.3,"This is the first Trappist product that I have not been disapointed by.  Generally, I find that the Trappist Ales, for whatever reason, just cant live up to the hype.  Although I had some carbonation problems, this one was quite good.  Incredible peppery, cinnamony aroma.  It was overcarbonated on the pour, but once it settled down it seemed to be OK.  Deep brown colour that turns to a magnificient glowing orange when held up to the light.  Immense, rocky, beige head.  Beatiful balance: failry sweet and fruity (I taste banana)at the begining, with a bitterness and warmth developing late.","San Diego, California, USA","Kaya161"

Deep, dark opaque red-brown in color, very solid-looking, with a fluffy, tan head, large bubbles.  Flavor is appropriately complex, with a large amount of milk chocolate sweetness, spice cake and fresh, doughy bread.  Finish is tangy, nutty, faintly fruity (tangerine??) yeasty, lightly alcoholic and longer than long.  Wondrous development, subtle nuances reveal themselves continously.

2866,"2002-11-28",4.7,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2004 And another update:  I tasted this side by side with St. Bernardus Prior 8.  Rochefort is a lot less viscous in comparison, but I think this actually helps me identify the complex flavors a bit more easily.  This sample had a lot of cigar-tobacco flavors which I liked quite a bit.  Update:  Elegant and restrained banana, clove, wood and grape aromas and flavors in the perfect smooth, creamy body.  I rather like how nicely the esters are restained (banana can become too much).  Hugely complex with an astonishingly long finish.

Old:  I have zero interest in being an iconoclast, but I simply could not find enough flavor in this beer to give it very high marks.  It is rather nice and well balanced with acidic tartness providing a nice finish.  Head lasts throughout.  I fear that I am simply blind to the charms of the Belgians.

2866,"2002-09-20",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 4, 2004 I am a   fan of big dark beers such as Baltic Porters, Sri Lanka's Lion Stout, any Imperial Stout, a good vintage Ale such as that produced by Traquair, and almost anything by the Titanic brewery, but I do have a little problem with the Trappist ales of Belgium. It's not that I don't enjoy them, it's just that the praise they get seems absurd when they are compared with some of the ales I have mentioned above. But this - a product of the lesser known and more difficult to get of the five breweries - is certainly a handsome beer. Full of dark flavours and aromas such as chocolate, port, red fruits, enlived with (in my young bottle - bought and laid down a mere 6 months ago) a gentle fizz or life. The after-taste is surprising dry - almost dusty or chalky, which contrasts well with the alcohol fruit of the nose. The alcohol intrudes a bit, but in an all embracing, gentle and benign manner, and not as much as one would expect from a 9.2% abv. Mix the yeast in and it produces an invigorating explosion of flavours that is quite exciting. It's a damn good beer, but does it live up to the hype? Mine is still five years from it's best before date, and it's bloody good now - but it's not the nectar of the gods. It's a good beer, quite heady, flavoursome, soft and very enjoyable (and moreish - I wish I another one!) - but one of the best beers in the world? Mmmmm. Could well be. Yes. Could well be! [4.4]  Part of the Tripel Taste Test. Conclusion: This one was the most interesting and involved.

As its swallowed and the flavor lengthens, the finish becomes long and toasty with a lingering sweetness of apples and pears, with a final smack of smokiness and faint chocolate.  Very complex, worthy of the Trappist label, but I do with the alcohol was a mite more muted--has a bit too much burn to it.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"

Decided to rate it side by side w. a Westy 8. This one was the better beer. Color identical, good head, less than Westy though. Beautiful aroma of fruity yeast, bread, and a perfumy, violet-like, almost soapy fragrance that I couldnt identify, but  somehow fit. Sweet malty richness, wine, brandy, anise, chocolate. Alcohol prominent but not so much as the Westy 8. Sweet finish w. no hops present. I leave the description to ecrvich, who is way beyond me here.

2866,"2002-04-02",3.3,"UPDATED: SEP 12, 2016 Bottle (BB Oct 2020, so about 1 year old).

Head is initially large, frothy/fizzy, light brown, mostly diminishing.
Body is cloudy medium orange-brown, bottle conditioned.

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (cookie, caramel), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with notes of raisin, cola, orange peel.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery/syrupy texture, fizzy carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

I once loved this as much as anyone else, but the reality is that its just not that special. The mouthfeels of all three Rocheforts suffer the same problem...theyre watery and fizzy and unsatisfying to drink. They smell nice enough, if not all the way to great, and the flavor balance is decent enough for the styles, but again not particularly rich or satisfying. Every 4 or 5 years I try them all again, and always I am mildly disappointed. And so it is again here in 2016. Orval and Westvleteren are still the only notable Trappists.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Big malt start, the middle is medium, the finish is nicely hopped, the Alcohol definately rears its head at the finish as it warms you pleasantly.

This changed my opinion about how long a beer can be safely aged; at 26 years old, it had completely transcended beer and had an almost Sherry-like quality, very complex with prune/plum/chocolate undertones and wasnt overly alcohol tasting.  Very little head (to be expected) and lots of chunks meant drinking this through my clenched teeth chunky bits filter.  Was almost a religious experience tot he very end, so if you have the opportunity to enjoy a well-aged beer, I highly recommend it.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","pruckelshaus99"

Feisty carbonation is firm but steadily softens. Lush malts are quickly lifted by a dry sweep of alcohol and dusty dryness.   Supple notes of raisins and fruitcake offset the dryness to a degree. Intensely rummy, but the attenuation is so high, the body suffers a bit. Finishes with lingering notes of dates, figs, and soft hints of wood and medicinal alcohol.
