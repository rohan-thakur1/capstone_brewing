Not that I really had any good reason to expect a big juice bomb but this is anything but. Perfume for days, mimicking honeysuckle, with delicate dots of honey and very light biscuit notes. Seems to mostly driven by citra, which are here done better than most, with no cat (not even the good cat) and little, if any, dustiness or scallion. Mild mango character and bits of dry nectarine from the other two hops but absolutely pine free. Its great when simcoe is done right. Anyhow, I just sat and sniffed my glass for 5 minutes or so. Uncannily honeysuckle-aromatics are delightful and linger delicately.Perfect texture/carbonation, as always, with no alcohol/flaw nor surplus of bitterness. Dry, with some dextrine or wheat-like chewiness to it with soft honey notes emerging more and more with warming and lots of lemon, light pineapple and grapefruit lingering wonderfully. Doesnt even matter if they got the exact hop aromatics/flavors they wanted; the yeast, water and malt bring up the slack easily.  God damn.

4037,"2016-05-14",4.1,"(on tap @ CBC 2016) If I cant have Susan I can always have Sumner - the overlooked beer at the CBCs blue session since this had been poured already the day before during the Warpigs HF tap takeover.

Aroma has notes of peach, mango and pineapple juice and perhaps a hint of spruce. Mouthfeel shows oily texture, medium carbonation, a medium to light body and a relatively crisp, dry and flavourful finish. Flavour follows the nose with moderate tropical fruite and subdued bitterness. I could easily drink 40 times as much as the 5 cl offered but the key lies in moderation I suppose.

This was poured into a tulip. 
The appearance was a hazy burnt orange color with a slim fingers worth of a bar pours kind of head. Adequate lacing sticks and then slides after quick dissipation of the head.
The smell had a sweet orange juice bitterness with subtle zest, extra citrus, light grassy, somewhat grapefruit pulp and rind blending for full effect. 
The taste was a balanced bitter to sweet citrus / grapefruit bitter rind. Citrus full in effect in the aftertaste and bitter finish.

Cette bière qui à laveugle ne pourrait provenir dailleurs que de la colline vermontoise, ma gagné par son fabuleux bouquet olfactif sur une base de grains frais. À ce grain blond, des houblons fruités ajoutent une touche estivale et festive. Ça sent lété! Saveurs moins réjouissantes pour moi. Les houblons sont mi fruités, mi résineux. Saveurs de foin, de campagne, de vieille grange. En fait, cette bière mapparaît beaucoup plus aromatique que réellement savoureuse. Pour toute saveurs, au-delà dune présence de grains et de houblons pamplemoussés, le reste mapparaît manque de mordant.
