2292,"2017-05-20",4.1,"Tap at Arendsnest. Oak bomb. Really cool beer. Cuts through the Quad aspect a lot. Filtered, really almost thin somehow. Really great example of oak ageing. Super clean for the ABV.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
2292,"2017-05-14",3.6,"Bottled. Thanks Benzai. 20cl sample. The aroma has caramel, white wine. Bit hazy, brown coloured beer with a thin head. The taste is light-moderate sweet and has caramel and white wine. Okay.","Baarn, NETHERLANDS","skortila"
2292,"2017-04-28",4.2,"Oranje ondoorzichtig bier met een kleine witte schuim kraag. Ruikt naar vanille, hout, druiven, alcohol. Smaakt naar vanille, hout, wijn, druiven en een klein beetje alcohol. Lekkah","s-Hertogenbosch, NETHERLANDS","Abijen"
2292,"2017-04-18",4.5,"From tap. A very beautiful amber colour. Fruity, dried fruit, strong oak flavour giving a scotch flavour : its like a whiskey beer. One of the most tasteful beer I ever drank (but Im not sure what batch it was : April 2017)","Nantes, FRANCE","buddybutch"
2292,"2017-03-30",3.2,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2017 Bottle, 12:56 (from hetbiermoment). Pours ruby amber with beige head. The head stays. Aroma is intese, fruits, malt, oak, grapes, apples. Flavor is sweet and bitter, caramel, fruits, apples, grapes, sugar, malt, rubber. Finish is sweet and malty with some oaky-white whine notes. Overall: this is easily the worst la trappe quad oaked I have tried... and its even one of the worst la trappe beers I have tried. Maybe its too fresh and will improve with age?!","Tallinn, ESTONIA","martjoobolut"
2292,"2017-03-19",4.0,"Mooie oranje bruine kleur met een goede kraag. Ruikt enerzijds fruitig witte wijn, anderzijds vanille, crème. Smaakt vol vanille, crème, houtig, tikkeltje witte wijn.","Gemonde, NETHERLANDS","Bosbouw"
2292,"2017-02-19",4.0,"Fles (37.5 cl) gedeeld met familie. Donker amberkleurig, troebel bier. Aroma is fruitig en kruidig. Ook de wijn komt goed in de geur naar boven. Smaak is zoetig, houtig, fruitig en kruidig. Nasmaak is iets wrang van de wijn. Ietsje bittere nasmaak.","Oirschot, NETHERLANDS","Inoven"
2292,"2017-02-19",4.2,"Fles gedeeld door Inoven, geprobeerd met Bart en Joep. Het is een heerlijk bier met t zure van de wijn lekker aanwezig.","NETHERLANDS","TomHendriksen"
2292,"2017-02-19",3.8,"Bottle shared by Benzai, BB 09-2041, 10 cl sample. Hazy amber color, short frothy head. Aroma of typical La Trappe Quad caramel and spicy yeast, some white wine and a bit of oak. Bit sweet in taste, white wine, oak wood. Bit dry in the finish. Good.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
2292,"2017-02-17",3.1,"Bottle shared with Caesar and Skortila @ Caesar. Clear light amber color, average sized beige head. Smell and taste malts, sweetness, sugary, some alcohol, light oak. Hmm, not great this one. Decent.","Oirschot, THE NETHERLANDS, NETHERLANDS","Benzai"
2292,"2017-01-31",4.4,"Bottle from online Kloosterwinkel La Trappe. Beautiful dark brown/chestnut colour. Medium carbonation. Sweet nose of white wine, plums, chocolate, cognac, vanilla. Well balanced, sweet and light vinous. Still a bit young but this beer will develop great!","Oosterzele, BELGIUM","JefVerstraete"
2292,"2017-01-29",4.5,"Aroma:

Heavy aroma of malts, caramel, Belgian yeast, wood, vanilla, fruit and white wine.

Appearance:

Turbid/opaque red/dark brown beer with a slight/medium beige head.

Taste/Palate:

Medium/heavy sweet with malts, caramel, Belgian yeast, wood, vanilla, fruit and white wine.

2292,"2016-12-30",4.9,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2017 Bottled, bought at the monastery. Clear red brown colored, small beige head. Very powerful complex nose as soon as you open the bottle. Absolutely beautiful, lots of wood, vanilla, smoky notes, complex white wine, malts from the quadrupel shining through, ethanol, some sherry, hint of apples. Extremely smooth flavor, strongly reminds me of ""Steen op Hout"" South African white wine, which dominates, but with the quadrupel blending in extremely nice, wood, smoke, and tannins (thats rare in beer), carbonation, which is relatively high level but adds to the complexity. Wow. Just wow. This is phenomenal, better than many wines that are twice the price of this already pretty expensive beer. Such a shame these guys only make different versions every time. This is one they should redo, over and over again.","Bussum, NETHERLANDS","jerohen"
