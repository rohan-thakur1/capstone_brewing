73,"2015-06-23",4.2,"Draft at Go Tavern. This is probably the best Pipeworks beer Ive had. Fermentation was super clean, alcohol was restrained, impressive balance of passion fruit, hops, and Fresno chili. Really getting great subtle contribution from everything showing great finesse. Damn impressive. the chili is a touch green but thats to be expected, heat never builds up and it works with the fruitiness of the beer. This was a really cool beer and works well.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
73,"2015-05-05",3.5,"Bomber. Pours a murky, light orangey-gold, medium frothy white head with decent retention and lacing. Nose is passion fruit, green chilis, playing ping pong with the hops. Also getting some white pepper, citrus and mango, but the chilis and passion fruit are definitely in command. Mouth is medium bodied, creamy and dry, the chilis are in the foreground and mix with everything else as well (and by everything else, I mean tropical fruit, some crackery malt, mild bitterness, grapefruit). This would go well with Mexican chow... so I guess its good that I got a big old pot of carnitas simmering away in their own fat on the stove ... it is Cinco de Mayo after all. Odd brew, but not in a bad way. I missed this the first time around. Was worth waiting for.","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"
73,"2014-10-31",3.8,"Pretty clear gold pour with a white head. I really enjoyed the playfulness of this beer. The hops, passionfruit and peppers actually were in harmony more than I would have figured. Not overly spicy or fruity, just pretty much spot on. Well done guys.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
73,"2014-04-18",3.8,"Orange clear pour from 22oz bottle. Aroma is mostly chilies. Fruity peppery taste. Tart. Mild hops. Really unique. Grew on me thru the bottle","Chicago, Illinois, USA","kaser"
73,"2014-04-02",3.9,"Pours a murky golden orange color with small off white head. Solid fruity aroma nothing I can pinpoint. Some lacing. What the beer lacks in ""looks"" it more than makes up for in flavor. Usually beers with peppers lack balance but this beer has really nice balance with the passion fruit and iipa body. Really creative I'm liking it. Keep me coming pipeworks.

73,"2014-03-31",3.9,"A- pours an opaque and milky orange with lighter gold edges. One finger of foamy egg shell white head with decent lacing and solid retention. S- passion fruit and wild jalapeño peppers. Some mustiness, lemon juice, lime juice, orange, grass, pine resin and arid earth. Also has a slight chile relleno or sweet green chilies. Sourdough. M- tacky medium body with an acidic and spicy medium to full palate. Good carbonation. T- green chilies, butter and passion fruit are all forward. Grapefruit, lemon and mango cone next. Pine is interspersed throughout with coupled more malty characteristics. The malts and acidic quality of the fruits holds the pepper capsaicin in check nicely. Ending is dry and relatively quick for a pepper infused beer. Good lemon and lime notes. Some mild soda water, grass and soap. Pepper holds only slightly at the end and does not over stay its welcome.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
73,"2014-03-22",4.0,"Ugh, I hate to buy Pipeworks and especially having to pay $9 for 10oz. Got a small sample but it was the bomb. Strong passion fruit puree, which I love. It fresh natural fruity tropical sweet, just awesome. A hint of dry pepper. Flavor follows suit, nice stuff, super adjuncty but I love it. Great pepper kick at the end, like dry jalapeno but no burn. Thick glowing orange , low clarity. Slightly lower carbonation.-- rated with beerbasher/winphone","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
73,"2014-03-19",4.1,"A: Orange and copper in color. Light head, and fairly hazy. 

S: The Chiles hit you right in the nose at the start, you can smell the heat. Theres some sweetness in there but cant really pick anything out. A nice change of pace, nothing I have smelled in a beer yet.

T: At the first taste you get that huge nice sweetness from the passion fruit, then fades into the nice taste of the chili without any detection of heat. Pleasantly surprised after smelling it. Love it.

M: Light, and sweet. Really easy to drink beer.

O: I was worried with the smell that it would have a bite of heat but ended up being really nice and fruity with the flavor of the pepper. Im a big fan of heat and all and quite sensitive of heat but love the flavor of peppers, which I got in this beer. Love this beer.","Illinois, USA","CraftBeerLvr41"
73,"2014-03-13",3.8,"Batch #318 319, bottled February 10, 2014.
Appearance: The body is a vibrant orange with a milky haze in it. The head has awful retention and settles to a thin coating with bubbly off-white edges.
Aroma: Whoa, this is pretty fucking great smelling. From far away the aroma is very fruity, I got some mango and big citrus aromas of all kinds. Up close the peppers really take a prominent role giving heat, an earthiness and hints of smoke. Holy cow this smells wonderful.
Taste: The flavor isnt quite as bold as the aroma, but that may be a good thing. The intro is of orange but the peppers add a mild heat and a raw jalapeno flavor starting with the mid-taste. Ive never had passion fruit, but I assume thats whats really balancing the pepper beneath it. Towards the end I get some mango with sweet orange, the peppers mostly fade by the finish. Lingering Im left with some pepper skin and orange.
Palate: Full-bodied, a slight slimy texture, with mild carbonation.
Overall: This is one of the best pepper beers Ive had. Im going through a 650ml bottle by myself with no problems. I love the huge aroma and the flavor nearly matches it. There are so many food pairing possibilities with this also. I would love to try various Mexican dishes with this as well as some deserts.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"
73,"2014-03-03",3.7,"Pours a very hazy, deep orange color with almost no head. Aroma is a pronounced orangy nose with a hot, jalapeno type peppery spice to it. Flavor is very unique. I dont feel any spice (my spice tolerance is really high) but the fresh cut pepper flavor really comes through first and is cut by the sweet citra orange flavor of the hops. Flavors are balanced well with it favoring the pepper flavor a tad bit more. Body is modest with a lower amount of carbonation and a lot of pepper/yeast sediment comes out on the last pour from the bottle. Overall a very unique, well done brew but its definitely a one try brew. The passion fruit I am not sure where that works into the flavor as the brew seems sweetened more from the malt/citra hops than from the fruit.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"
73,"2014-03-01",3.8,"Thats a spicy pale ale from pipeworks. Made with green chillies it leaves you with a sweet hot finish. Has a nice kick of hopps in there. Had this at home.

73,"2014-02-25",3.6,"22 oz bomber crushed with my Honkeybra. Hazy orange pour with a white head. Initial hit of chilies and green pepper. Get some of the citrus and passion fruits after a minute. Flavor is mostly sweet, get some green pepper as well, but no real heat from the chilies. Very interesting.","Colorado, USA","That1Guy"
73,"2014-02-19",3.1,"Bottle from Binnys southloop. Poured hazy yellow orange with min head. Aroma of hop resin. light carb med bod. Taste mainly of green pepper with grapefruit spice. Not the best from Pipeworks.","New York, New York, USA","charule"
73,"2014-02-15",3.6,"Batch 318/319. Bomber. A quite hazy yellowish slightly orange color. Almost wit looking. Aroma is fruity hops, very tropical smelling like tropical a mixed fruit juice with quite a bit I fresh fruity pepper. Taste is up front with the pepper. No real hear in the pepper but lots of pepper flavor somewhere between eating a raw green bell pepper and eating one of those peppers you get from papa johns. Pepper taste is followed by a very fruity hops. They say the fruit is added but it seems very natural and blend very well with the citra packed in. Pepper and tropical fruits slowly fade. This was very interesting. Certainly one of the more unique beers Ive had in my day, and seemed to pair well with the sushi I had for dinner. Definitely a bottle to split. The flavors are very strong and it gets to be a little to much after half the bottle.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
73,"2014-02-12",3.8,"22 oz. bottle. My most sought after Pipeworks beer. I was excited to try it when I heard about it originally and was disappointed I couldnt find a bottle. Pours a hazed orang color with a small sparse white head. Aroma of tropical fruits, passion fruit, chiles, mild heat detectable from the nostrils. Flavor is fruity, but the sweetness is cut by chile and mild chile heat. Medium bodied, average-- but appropriate-- carbonation.This is a refreshing take on a pepper beer: focusing less on heat and more on the overall enjoyability. I enjoyed it.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
73,"2014-02-01",4.0,"Bottle and served in PW snifter: Pours a hazy golden hue with a lasting head, good lace. Wonderful tropical fruits and spices supported by biscuity and caramel malts. Lots of the standard PW yeast and hop character but the moderate pepper upon the finish sets this apart from most IPA.DIPA.
