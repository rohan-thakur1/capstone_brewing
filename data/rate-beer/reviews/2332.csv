Highly carbonated, the cork popped of with barely a nudge. The heavy carbonation gives it a lighter palate than I was expecting. Lots of dark fruit, spice, the oak comes through near the end.

Aroma features plum, raisin, brown sugar, and maybe a little caramel. Taste is very complex. Dark fruits - raisin and plum definitely come through. A strong rush of sugary malts as the sip progresses. Alcohol presence felt bringing with it a bourbon-like mouthfeel and warmth. The finish is very unique...almost a toasted marshmallow quality and a tingling mouthfeel that lingers during the aftertaste.

2332,"2016-03-19",4.8,"Its a muddy, murky brown pour with an off white, foamy head reminiscent of the one that Rochefort 10 produces. Aromas are complex with everything from raisins to mint entering the mix. On the tongue, there are figs, dates, raisins,and a smidgen of booziness. Some vanilla on the swallow too.
Overall, this is a very complex beer, best sipped (and not just because of the high ABV) to get the full enjoyment out of, especially considering how it morphs and evolves as ambient room temperature effects it. This is a truly outstanding brew out of Canada and one very well worth your effort to track down.","","Randy4Beer"

Big nose of molasses, oak, rum, banana, spice, dark fruit. On the palate, cherries, raisins and prunes step up to replace the banana, and the spice note resolves into cinnamon, allspice, white pepper. Maple syrup jousts with a bit of bitter heat, as is added to a young port.
Its a wonderfully complex, evolving brew. The 2013 bottle Im drinking at the moment started out almost too big, but moderated with aeration. The alcohol remains subordinate to the flavors, but Im glad Im not driving anywhere later.","","Pumpkin87"

The aroma is rich & reasonably fruit forward defiantly has some pear & dried cherry maybe a little prune. Its a touch nutty and certainly pretty woody, & lightly roasty. 

Well this is a complex beast of a beer, theres no doubt that there is oak in there, maybe a little more than Id normally like but with everything else going on it works about as well as it could. Its nutty, lightly bitter, and quite fruit forward with plenty of pear, plum, and dark cherry. The alcohol is on all accounts a part of the flavor, it drinks like a 10%er but thats not to say this element is unpleasant at all, it gives it a sort of ""warming"" character that works well with the fruit, wood, etc. As it warms some chocolate, roast, & dark brown sugar come forward a bit. It seems like its spiced, and it seems a reasonable proposition that it might... its got some bitter orange peel if I were to guess, but beyond that Im having a hard time putting my finger on anything specifically. 

The palate is heavy, but the texture is velvety.

2332,"2015-02-21",3.8,"ENG: 750ml bottle from Liquor Mart, Winnipeg. Dated 2014, No. 2013-38240. Poured into the tulip, gives very hazy / opalescent dark brown color, like a earl grey tea but mixed with honey or something hazy. Thick, creamy tan head and some lacing. In aromas there are cloves, bananas, champagne, caramel and notes of herbal hops. Tastes sweet champagne with banana flavor, a bit smoky, caramel and malty. Heavy sour then woody to bitter aftertaste. A lot of booze feeling, high carbonation, medium to high body.

I sound like a broken record when talking about Unibroue, but they really do a very impressive job of the Belgian styles. This thing is complex and has benefited from nearly a year in my cellar (and nearly two in the bottle), mellowing the ABV and tempering the woody and vinous notes. Lots of dark rich fruit, and an almost nutty finish. I could have thrown a lot more aroma comparisons in there: bubblegum, cinnamon, citrus peel, raisins, bread dough - basically, if you can think it, you can find it in there, especially as it warms and opens up. Yet, for all the complexity of flavour, its not heavy or syrupy. Extremely well done. (18/20)","CANADA","UXO"

It's full flavored with a slightly nutty malt base, bubble-gummy yeast, and lingering tannic bitterness. The beer has a rich winter-weather approved malt base, but is stretched thin by a big yeast fruit presence, bitter oak astringency, and double digit abv. The beer's generous carbonation helps oxy-clean some of those heavy flavors off the palate, but it still sits heavier than expected.

Off-white/tan finger’s-worth of lacy head that does not dissipate and clings well to the sides of the glass. No visible carbonation.

Fairly dark brown with a large light beige head that fades to a lasting coat. Aroma of stewed and dried fruit - plums, prunes, muscatels - Port, some mocha, an earthy and doughy yeastiness thats a bit surprisingly far in the background (although it creeps up a bit). Bittersweet chocolate registers as much as the fruit in the taste. Has that bottom-end rumble that can make intense fruit flavours more easily drinkable without seeming lush. Fullish bodied and fairly sweet, but it dries out a bit and theres a spiciness to the bitterness and I guess the oak at the end. Suggestion of Armagnac-like booze there too, but nothing hot.

2332,"2014-07-26",4.2,"Poured from bottle into a snifter glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a very murky brownish-red color with a small foam head of an off white tan color. The head fades moderately fast leaving only a decent level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the beer is massive and sweet with tons of darker fruits. The darker fruit smells are heaviest of a raisin smell, but contain other aromas of plum and fig as well. Along with the dark fruit are some rather strong smells of candied sugar as well as some smells of molasses. Other Belgian aromas of a yeasty smell as well as a decent showing of spice of a coriander, clove, and pepper aroma are there. Some banana smells and a bit of a boozy red wine smell mix with the sweeter Belgian strong dark smells nicely to produce a sweet and inviting aroma overall.
 Taste  The taste begins much drier then would have been anticipated from the nose, but does begin with many of the flavors that may have been expected. Some darker fruit flavors of a raisin and fig taste mix with a decent showing of a toasted grain and spiced flavor of coriander and clove. As the taste advances, the darker fruit fade some, but are replaced by a bit of brown sugar and molasses, maintaining an overall moderate sweetness. All the while, the roasted flavors increase some and are joined by some rum and some grapy red wine flavors. Some woody flavors also come to the tongue more toward the end, mixing the more boozy rum and red wine flavors nicely and bringing in the barrel aged flavor the would be expected from the label. A bit of a cocoa and yeasty flavor come more toward the end as well, and with them bringing a light spicy earthy flavor, to overall in the end, leave a darker fruity, more lightly sweetened, Belgian strong dark flavor with a nice heavy warming feel to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the slightly thicker side with a carbonation level that is higher and pricklier. The bigger body is nice for the darker and boozy flavors of the beer all while the prickly carbonation is fantastic for the fruity, yeasty spiced, and sweet flavors of the beer. Overall, well done.
 Overall  like most of Unibroues beers, this is a very enjoyable and quite tasty brew with lots of robust flavors that blend rather well with each other. A very tasty Belgian strong dark.","","Darkmagus82"

2332,"2014-06-30",3.7,"October 2nd, 20120 - Unibroue was a keystone to my early beer drinking days. Plowing through all four of the core bottles, I learned several important lessons about craft beer which I carry with me today. First, craft beer is good. Second, different styles taste differently. Third, foreign countries make excellent craft beer. Simple lessons, yes, but while they may be parsimonious, they are profound, and essentially the hooks by which I was caught into this now admittedly expensive hobby. Opening the Unibroue 17 was a kind of lap marker, pointing me back to those college days where I had to scrape together enough money to enjoy half a bomber per week, but it was always money well spent, as is the 17. Cherrywood and a light, parmesan cheese umami form around a core aroma of cherry sourness, wet moss and a tang of greek yogurt. The scent is like a sour, but not quite so dramatic, and a little more tanginess than Id expect in a sour. While the aroma is effervescent, and even bubbly with its quirky mixture of scents, the taste is a little flatter and staid - more parmesan and yogurt, with herbal touches akin to dill and parsley. These are grouped with the taste of gingerbread and clove, though all of it subtle, and never too loud or cloying.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

I poured this into a chalice.
The appearance was a nice ruddy brown color with a one finger white foamy head that leaves some nice adequate somewhat clingy lacing.
The smell had the Belgian spicy sweetness carrying over into a vast array of dark sugar coated candied fruits such as plums and raisins.
The taste was exceptionally sweet through the plums and raisins but the Belgian spices tend to take a back seat here. There is a super long sweet dark fruity aftertaste with a long dark fruity and somewhat sticky finish.
On the palate, it sits about a medium to heavy on the body and maintains a mostly sipper sort of fashion about it. The carbonation is very smooth and silky coating my mouth and tongue, although, this could be due to the age of this beer as well.
Overall, though theres a good almost two years on this beer, I say this is still very well done and if youre willing to pay the money for it, dont pass it up if you like/love the Belgian spicy sweets.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Colour is a beyond-gorgeous deep, deep red with a foamy off-white head that looks to be in no hurry to go down. Nose has a smokey quality to it, along with the regular sweet richness of the Belgian yeast. Flavour is somewhat metallic, surprisingly on the light side compared to some of their other offerings. Ripe fruit, smokey oak, slight orange peel, slightest hint of gingerbread. Its strength is completely hidden, that is certain. Not one of my favourite offerings from Unibroue, but still quite good. I wonder what a bit of extra aging will do.

2332,"2013-11-11",3.8,"Après en avoir dégusté plusieurs bouteilles au cours des trois dernières années, (mêmes des bouteilles vieillies), voici un espèce de résumé de mes observations:
Olfactif: Tous les échantillons présentaient un nez complexe aux arômes de caramel, dépices, de cannelle, de clou de girofle, de menthe poivrée, de mélasse et de sucre de canne. Des notes danis, de réglisse et de cerises sont également présentes. Un nez extrêmement complexe, aromatique et puissant.
Visuel: De couleur brune, très floue, avec beaucoup de particules de levure. La mousse est de moyenne à abondante, beige, effervescente et persistante. Elle colle également très bien au verre. 
Gustatif: Le poivre sort énormément en attaque avec des notes de tabac, laissant ensuite place au caramel. Leffervescence est continue en bouche. Lalcool est marquée et enveloppante. Les saveurs ont beaucoup de difficultés à sinstaller a cause de la trop forte présence des notes de poivre et de tabac. Dommage, ça aurait pu être une grande bière.

2332,"2013-10-06",4.5,"Presentation: It was poured from a corked and caged 750ml bottle into a tulip glass. The bottle lists the abv at 10%.

Appearance: The body has a deep brown color with dark crimson highlights. A thick and creamy off white head stands on top. This head hangs on very well and leaves nice lace patterns on the glass.

Smell: There is an interesting blend of sweet malts, dark fruits, grapes, funky yeast, and earthy old leather. The 10% abv is very noticeable but in an inviting way. Just noticeable underneath everything else I pick up some very slight herbal hop notes. 

Taste/Palate: The flavor notes are well blended and backed up with some serious but tasty booziness. Just like the nose suggests it has dark fruit and wine like grape notes with malty sweetness and earthy yeast. Hops are light and add a touch of leafy spice and herbal character off in the distance. The palate has a firm full feel and body with plenty of carbonation to keep it lively and drinkable.

Aroma is an instant hit of musty grape, oak, stale bread, faint chocolate, and some unidentifiable spice (cinnamon?).  Becomes more identifiable with warming and I believe it is cinnamon along with some clove.  Further warming dampens the aroma oddly enough.  The flavor holds some nice chocolate flavors with dark fruit (blackberry) in the front and oak in the finish thats coupled with the chocolate.  The mouthfeel is really nice, and with the large head I thought that this would be overcarbed, but its softly carbonated which does wonders to the subtle finish.

2332,"2013-02-23",3.6,"750ml from Sams, Durham. Felt sure I had rated this before, but Im always happy to grab a brew from these folks since the quality is almost always high (especially when compared to the price). Dusky dark brown pour, billowing head, and plenty carb as per usual. Love the house yeast and dark fruits in the nose, surprisingly bright in places like Gouden Carolus. Ripe and yeasty everywhere, but not in the mellowed old ale sense. The abundant hops and dry finish relieve any possibility there.

Palate leads with fruit (citrus, fig), caramel, oaky vanilla, and some spice. Fades into dark bread, more woody characters, orange rind, pepper, finishing with a little alcohol heat and some bitterness mixed with the remains of the wine-like acidity that is present throughout - not a sugar bomb at all.

Pours a mostly opaque medium dark brown, above average carbonation and off-white head.  Settles to sudsy, foamy cap and laces with lots of carbonated bubbles. 

Aroma is a bit peppery and a little bready yeast to my nose. 

Mouthfeel is mid creamy and mildly fizzy carbonation. 

Taste.  Too complex for me to really pin down anything but it basically has a taste pretty similar to Trous Pistoles.  That same specific spice (coriander?) that is obvious in TP.  Maybe add some fruits like plums or figs...  All I know is that it is quite tasty.

2332,"2012-12-31",3.7,"Best by 12-12-2016; Sampled December 2012
A steady pour into my Bruery Tulip produces a two finger thick, light amber tinged, tan color. The beer is a concentrated amber color that shows a mostly clear, red-plum hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells of dark fruit notes like plums, red grapes, a savory raisin note, and perhaps a touch of dates. There is a rich maltiness here that has caramelized overtones to it, touches of English biscuit, and some brown bread like character and, in combination with a light woody note, adds some savory character to this beer. 

The beer has a soft carbonation that provides some nice prickly character, and the body has a medium fullness to it though it lightens up pretty well in the finish. The finish has a nice savory character to it, rich concentrated plum notes, brown grain crackers, a light woody, toasted oak, and a touch of spicy, oaky, astringency. Clove features prominently here, and there is an earthiness to the spice character that is a bit like coriander, and this also has some cardamom like notes to it. Hints of chocolate mix quite well with dark fruit notes, touches of roses, and perhaps some carnations. The finish has quite a phenolic spiciness to it as the beer warms up. 

The best part of this beer is that it is very well balanced, and quite integrated. The complaint, though it isnt very significant, is that there isnt really anything that pops here; the beer is a low rumble of goodness, with quite a bit of complexity, but is so well balanced and integrated that everything just works.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Unibroue blijft een interessante brouwerij voor mij, hun bieren vind ik wel over het algemeen goed en interessant maar ik vind het onmogelijk om wat zij doen Belgisch te noemen, geïnspireerd misschien maar ook niet volledig, origineel vind hen wel. Fin du Monde is bevoordeeld hoe ik het ook niet bekijk een hefe een geen tripel wat ik denk de bedoeling was. In tegenstelling tot Belgische bieren kunnen hun bieren echt niet oud worden wat wel de bedoeling is denk ik. Ik geniet gewoonlijk wel van hun spul maar ik denk niet dat ik extra moeite zal doen om eraan te geraken. Dit is bevoordeeld heel goed en origineel maar een quad is het niet maar dat hoeft dit ook niet te zijn voor mij, ik denk dat het vooral een kwestie is van hoe ik denk dat zij zich profileren als brouwerij. Donker rood amber, gebruinde kraag. Ruikt naar brood, zoet gerookt, hout in de zin van gewoon bomen, lichte soja / vlees ding, lichte zoete karamel, donker fruit.

Interesting offering, with some nice complexity.  It would probably improve with some age, but at this point it is a touch to syrupy, a touch too boozy, and a touch too sweet.

2332,"2012-09-02",3.3,"Eh, this was alright. I get the feeling that this is a beer that while they may ""suggest"" that you cellar it for a few years what that really means is ""If you dont cellar this for a few years it wont be very good."" Really fizzy upon first pouring it. It gets better as it warms but the oak character isnt what I thought it would be and it just tasted overall not matured. Not a bad brew but just not what I was expecting. Id be interested to know what it would taste like if it were allowed to age.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","NeoHippie2"

Medium solid off-white head. Nose: Deep malt that boasts spaghetti and meatballs aroma. Wet forest earth, distant mint, pecan pie filling. Complex but balanced. Taste: Medium-light sweet, medium-light bitter, medium sour. Initially hints of cola. A dryed malt middle that spits some spice, cinnamon and cranberry.

Le nouveau brassin ouvre le bal : jobserve une robe brune couverte par une mousse épaisse et dégénérative.  Une dentelle qui semble vouloir se dessiner sur la paroi.  Un premier nez de bananes mûres et dépices.  Une présence du chêne qui me semble être grimpé par les champignons et finement touché par la vanille.  Une levure qui porte les stigmates de la maison.  Un goût accaparé par les épices et par les notes surettes.  Des élans doux qui traversent cette marée belgo-germanique.  Une bouche bien crémeuse, légère et aérienne.  Une finale marquée par les épices et par certaines caractéristiques du chêne.  Un alcool habilement caché qui se manifeste, en fin de parcours, avec une chaude gentillesse.  La suite des choses est beaucoup plus spectaculaire.  On ouvre cette vieille bouteille de 2007 chez Yan.  À première vue, la robe est magnifique, beaucoup plus foncée que celle portée par sa jeune sur.  La mousse beige fait une remarquable entrée.  Elle est crémeuse, dense et indestructible.  Le premier nez est ravissant.  Il est fait de fruits confits avec des cerises et des raisins.  Le second et les suivants offrent une belle complexité.  Quelques notes surettes qui flottent dans latmosphère tandis que des vapeurs chocolatées qui séchappent vers les cieux.  Je note la naissance délicate de parfums de réglisse et dépices.  Peut-être est-ce le girofle qui donne cette impression de réglisse?  Des notes subtiles de la barrique qui simmiscent dans la conversation.  Sont-ce les quelques traces doxydation qui montent vers mes narines?  Les saveurs confirment cette sensation démerveillement.  La bouche est fruitée - goûteuse en cerises et en raisins confits - sucrée et aigrelette, chocolatée et épicée.  Un vrai régal.  On peut même penser ici à certaines grandes Belges.  Il y a du Rochefort, du Struise et du De Dolle dans cette mixture québécoise.  La sensation que laisse le liquide sur le palais est aussi très réussie.  Le liquide est encore bien voluptueux.  Son corps est bien présent.  Le pétillement nest pas atteint par lâge.  Les bulles sont vivantes et participent adéquatement.  La texture est bien crémeuse, presque molletonneuse.  La finale?  Une empreinte boisée sur des fruits complexifiés par les malts.  Un véritable coup de cur.  Une magnifique bouteille.  Ce soir, nous avons été chanceux.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

A little surprising, as theres so much, and I was under the assumption that French Oak was more subtle than the heavy handed American oak.  Dry finish with bitterness peaking at a 2, a little alcohol noted.  Aftertaste of some dusty raisins, tinge of roast. Medium high carbonation with a medium body.  very solid, though pretty heavy on the oak, which didnt bother me.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

Loads of sweet malts and Belgian candi sugar. Very nice beer, the guy at the cash said since it was 10% alcohol it must be good, and I am in no position to oppose him.

2332,"2011-05-13",4.5,"Presentation: It was poured from a corked and caged 750ml bottle into a tulip glass. The bottle lists the abv at 10%.

Appearance: The body has a deep brown color with dark crimson highlights. A thick and creamy off white head stands on top. This head hangs on very well and leaves nice lace patterns on the glass.

Smell: There is an interesting blend of sweet malts, dark fruits, grapes, funky yeast, and earthy old leather. The 10% abv is very noticeable but in an inviting way. Just noticeable underneath everything else I pick up some very slight herbal hop notes. 

Taste/Palate: The flavor notes are well blended and backed up with some serious but tasty booziness. Just like the nose suggests it has dark fruit and wine like grape notes with malty sweetness and earthy yeast. Hops are light and add a touch of leafy spice and herbal character off in the distance. The palate has a firm full feel and body with plenty of carbonation to keep it lively and drinkable.

Notes: Overall this is an outstanding and very well made big Belgian Dark Ale. It ages very well and brings lots of interesting complexity to the palate. Its too bad that this is only a limited one time brew.","Alden, New York, USA","rampmaster"

dark murky brown with cinnamon highlights. Thick 3-4 finger fluffy eggshell colored head.

smells of sweet bread with cinamin, raisin, little hits of chocolate. the smells are somewhat muted and blended as there is a lot going on in here. as it warmed and i swirled it i pulled some hints of bourbon.

I take my first sip and it rolls over te tongue with a pudding-like feel. Its thick and creamy, but yet on the edges and as it rolls the crazy carbonation bubbles wisp the pudding sensation away. 

My tongue pulls sweet doughy bread, now i want to eat a doughy slice of cinamin bread.. mmm cinamin and raisins with some dried cherries and even a bit of chocolate pudding. lets make a chocolate pudding center in our doughy sweet cinamon bread and plaster it with raisins and dried cherries. There is more in here, Im not quite sure what it all is, but there is a nice whirlwind of flavor in here.

I could drink a whole bottle of this with some christmas cookies or with some of that bread I was describing up above. I think if you want it with a meal im thinking seared duck breast with cherry sauce, nicoise salad, and Wild Rice. 

overall im thinking this is a fine beer from unibroue once again. If i could change anything, it would be to strengthen a few of these flavors and smells as the doughy sweet bread seems to take center stage for me.","Bloomington, Minnesota, USA","SourNotes"

2332,"2010-09-07",4.4,"In short: A fantastic hoppy Belgian dark ale.
How: Bottle 750ml.  Many many times.  This rating for a bottle about 2 
years after the beer release
The look: Almost clear ruby-brown body topped by a medium beige head with good retention. The body becomes a bit cloudy towards the end of the bottle
In long: Nose is fruit cakes and freshly baked brown bread.  Taste of berries, raisin bread, caramel, molasses, signature Unibroue yeast, lots of earth, woody hops, tobacco leafs, light spicy notes.  It is quite something how this beer has morphed over its two first years of existence.  Very fresh it was a hop bomb (not in an american way) and the beer was kind of all over the place.  A few years later it has settled down and it now tastes like a world class not-so-hoppy belgian strong ale.  It is amazing how ""fresh"" this beer tastes at two years of age.  My favourite Unibroue ever.  It was very good fresh but now I think it has peaked.  If you have any left, now is the time to drink them.  As with everything else, its all about timing, because you know, even the best Monday 7am really sucks ass compared to an average Friday 5pm.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Overall: This is one of the very best Belgian ales Ive ever had. After this 17th anniversary ale, the series has not been continued. The ones I had were 15th, 16th, and 17th anniversary, and all were equally phenomenal! Years later, Im having the 17th anniversary ale again. Fortunately, since it is a bottle-conditioned, Belgian ale, it improves with aging, rather than spoiling. So, it is just as good now, as it was when it was first released. Either that, or this beer has been brewed again since its first release.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","keokani"
2332,"2010-08-11",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2010 750 ml Bottle says DECEMBER 2010.  Deep chestnut translucent with big head. Smells of cherries and spice, alcohol, lemon. Taste those flavors and an almost mulled fruit quality, with dark berries and cinnamon. I am drinking this warm, probably a big mistake. May add more notes later with chilled portion **** Cooled off (actually ignored a while) this comes up aces. The palate firms up with an attractive dryness, and the dark cherry & dry fruit comes across almost a bit wine-like, maybe some rustic Ripasso process red wine from Italy. Still a challenging and strange beer but I respect it a bit more overall.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DerWeg"
2332,"2010-07-28",3.7,"A: The pour is a sort of muddy brownish amber color with a couple of fingers worth of khaki colored foam.

T: The flavor is quite similar to the nose, displaying a very solid fruit character. There are some cherries in addition to the raisins, plums, figs, pears and probably some others that Im missing. The malt is fairly bready with a molasses-like sweetness that is quite mild.

M: The body is more toward the full side with a really great carbonation that fills the mouth.

2332,"2010-04-22",4.2,"750ml bottle poured into my snifter.

A- Murky chocolate colored body that pours with a large 2 finger + foamy, light tan head. After the pour the head builds more and more and takes a long time to settle at a nice one finger head. The glass is loaded with lacing the entire way down (a white film sticks to the glass essentially). The thick, dynamic cloudiness can see billowing about when held up to the light and bubbles can be seen rising to the top. Perfect appearance for a BSDA.

S- Smell is interesting and good. Dark fruits like plums and grapes arise first as well as a root-beer like essence.

T- Upfront is a lot of plum, some grape, and a root beer cola flavor. A hint of spiciness is added for the finish but the flavor is pretty uniform throughout.

P- Low carbonation and a smooth, yeasty, yet syrupy mouthfeel. Medium to heavy body.

O- This is an awesome BSDA. It reminds me of a Canadian version of the Trappist beers. Its complex and the alcohol is well hidden. I will definitely pick this one up when I see it again. Another great offering from Unibroue.

2332,"2009-10-13",3.8,"75cl bottle that has been sitting at 41st Ave. Liquors forever.   For some reason, I figured I would give it a try after all this time.   My first impression upon tasting this is that it tastes like Unibroue.   Their house yeast is just too distinctive to think otherwise.   It works pretty well in this case though.   The color is a darker brown with an almost purple hue and a fizzy head that has some size at first, dies, and then settles into a lasting slick with some lace.   yeast chunks also abound after a less-than-perfectly-neat pour.   Brown sugar, plum, cinnamon, rosemary; the aroma is really what I want to call ""brightly fruity"" with some herbal spice in there too.   Sure, there is a more liquorous dried fruit quality, but generic berry with a light strawberry hint and some passion fruit are there too.   As much as I get out of the nose, the flavor seems to be more straightforward, with a sweet fruitiness and drying alcohol in good balance.   Spices seem to be giving a lot here as well; but who knows how much of that is the yeast.   I want to say rosemary, but I think that is just what is on my mind.   There is a woody dryness and some tobacco in the finish, with light bitterness and vaguely muted hop flavor that is more of a token than anything meaningful.   The body is on the light side, with typical Unibroue fizz and a healthy alcohol bite that dries out the tongue and helps scrape the residual sugars from the palate.   As much as there is in this that I want to scrutinize, namely the spice and roughness, this is a really interesting beer that manages to come together in a pretty drinkable package.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

Nose is nice and fairly complex; almost fruit cake-like with plenty of doughy yeast and fruity notes of dates, figs, blueberries, and raisins with other notes of dark chocolate, bundt cake, anise, and lots of baking spices (nutmeg, allspice).  Very similar flavor but more cake-like than anything else; the yeast is still very doughy, not quite bready, but less fruity than the nose.  Other notes of dark chocolate, faint coffee, anise, still lots of nutmeg and allspice, pecans, and lighter fruit notes of dates and blueberries.  Palate is near perfect with a full body, mild warmth, creamy/velvety/round feel, and a soft to lively carbonation.  Finishes with some light earthy bitterness, coffee notes which adds some light bitterness, dark chocolate which is also lightly bitter; a completely malt forward beer but finishes with a moderately low bitterness in a long progression leaving some cake and baking spices on the tongue.  Maybe it is the fact that I waited more than a year to try this one but everything was put together very well in this one.  It was complex with plenty of malt and yeast but still managed to create a nice bitterness in the finish which complimented the rest of the beer.  Not quite as good as 16 but still a very nice BSA.

Always a good thing when you pop the cork and its smoky off the bottle :)  It poured a really pretty garnet/mahogany color with a steady thick tan head (really, 15 minutes later this head is still hanging out and ready to roll).  Aroma was intense, different, and really exciting.  Its really bitter on the nose, candlewax (odd, but its the truth), cider, sour, carame;, and chocolate.    It tastes incredible.  Really something different for a Belgian style ale.  Its almost like a combination brown ale and Belgian...really something great..  Its got a mildly heavy mouthfeel - maybe a tad syrupy.  Its got a bit of the alcohol burn on the finish, but it doesnt distract too much from the greatness that is in this bottle.  Its creamy. and has a bit of a punch.

2332,"2009-07-08",4.5,"This poured out a dark and mysterious brown fluid, capped by a rocky off-white head of between and two fingers thickness.  Ive rarely seen a head like this, as it stayed and stayed and stayed like the thing that wouldnt leave, and as well the longer it hung around the creamier it became.  Great stuff, this.  The aroma was much more gentle that expected, featuring what I guess to be dark fruits and some spices.  Tasted like dark fruits and spices, too (dont ask me which ones, as Ive not got a bloody clue).  Also ""tastable"" (is that a word?) was the alcohol.  Solid mouthfeel and a nice finish make this a pleasure to drink.  Good thing Ive got another of these in the beer fridge, right next to a Unibroue 16.  Yeah, I screwed up and drank this one out of order.","Delta, British Columbia, CANADA","MrRoss"

2332,"2009-06-29",4.1,"***review from Aug 4, 2008***
Ive finally manned up and opened this sucker - I figure that if Im on 3 hours of sleep now is the time.
Pop of the cork gave a nice beer smoke that I inhaled - love that beer smoke! Poured out a nicely sized slightly foamy tan head that gives out lots of ropy lacing throughout - retained wonderfully - remember, this is 10%, and the whole thing sits on top of a mid to mid dark brown brew which was a colour that I had not expected. This beer looks awesome! The aroma is quite different than the what is usually expected from Unibroue: softer spiced yeast, almost completely lacks the standard Uni smell, soft raisin, I have no idea what the malts are here - its almost a Rum Butter"" ice cream aroma, the sweetness is somewhere between brown sugar and burnt sugar, dark candylike fruit... so much here on the aroma. The taste is different as well: sweet, spicy, mystery malts that I will just assume are there, plum, faint chocolate (maybe - I found this same idea in the aroma but could not give it to chocolate), something that is nutty without being nutty, condensed caramel, brown sugar, sour cherry just hit for the first time, seems smoky but isnt - this beer is just one big freaking mystery. The mouth feel is really good now, my marks keep climbing. Solid spice through out, over medium bodied, fluffy carbonation, nothing too harsh on the aftertaste: the spice has staying power but its not over the top. Interesting beer that is probably not worthy of a 4.2, Ill get another bottle or two. Unibroue has come up with something different and that is good.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"
2332,"2009-06-27",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2012 Strong, rich Belgian, though not very interesting nor complex. Pours dark and attractive, with a retained white head. The Belgian yeast aroma checks in.

Two fingers of off-white head quickly dissipates to a thin but persistent layer.  Aroma is complex and difficult to separate the components but here goes: yeast (less than many others from Unibroue), banana, plum, sweet grainy-ness, and some level of spice (clove and ginger?).  Flavor is similarly complex with wood, caramel, dark fruit, and a very nice level of molasses-like sweetness.  There is also a distinct ash/campfire flavor toward the end.  The 10% ABV is almost completely concealed.","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"

Flavor is a strong sweet dark cherry note with some light estery flavors, lots of sweet caramel malt, slight chocolate flavor at the very end and alcohol does come through a little as well at the end. Density is great and very heavy of sugar, carbonation is high and the head is just wicked, leaving behind a very thick and dense coating on the glass.

Aroma is wheat, yeast, perfume, summer fruit (peach maybe) and just a hint of the 10% alcohol. Very smooth flavor built on a wheat back bone, vanilla, yeast, plums, and tons of perfume all make into the taste. The alcohol starts to come out a bit too much when warmer but nothing too harsh.

2332,"2008-10-23",4.4,"Each year Unibroue brews a new Anniversary beer to celebrate, well, their anniversary. This year around I am helping Unibroue to celebrate their 17th Anniversary. A Belgian strong ale in terms of style, while the ABV may be high, 17 is delicate, whimsical, and personally one of the best beers I have tasted lately and can enjoy on a regular basis.

Sharing my bottle with my girlfriend, my 17 poured once more with an indomitable head of foam which occupied more space than the actual liquid brew herself. I always pour my beers slowly, but I was still amazed at how quickly her head almost toppled over the rim of my glass. Never one to rush a good thing, I waited for the head to fade before slowly topping her off. Of course, each step down, the head left soft and puffy layers of brussels lace along the sides. A light khaki in color, she covers my 17 below which is a lightly see-through brown. Bubbles cling to the side and slowly rise to the surface. In her nose I detect caramel, nuts, and fresh rye bread. My first few quaffs reveal a crisp effervescence that is marked by a full mouthfeel and thick body. Toffee, licorice, and crisp red apples are finished by a light bitter hop presence of grapefruit. Her finish is only mildly dry, choosing to leave instead a soft, decadent reminder of her sweet, chewy, bready body marked by apple notes and spice. A tinge of spice comes into play as my brew warms and I near the end of my glass. Very clean, tasty, smooth and full with just the right bite to round her off.

My only regret is that because the Unibroue 17 is an anniversary beer, once she is gone then she is gone and I shan’t ever partake of her deliciousness ever again. Of course, in preparation of that inevitability, I plan on setting aside at least one bottle to savor at an unknown later date. I could rave forever about Unibroue’s 17th Anniversary Belgian Strong Ale, but I would rather the uninitiated taste it themselves and discover the wonder contained within a 750ml corked bottle.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Surprisingly good. The aroma is a bit mild, but whats there is quite pleasant...spices very much in the cinnamon/clove/etc. vein, but not in a *spiced* way...subtle and mild, as if from the yeast rather than spice additions.  I had this side-by-side with the 2008 Lost Abbey Ten Commandments, and despite this not being an absolute blockbuster, it totally demolished the Lost Abbey.  Not even close.  A much better yeast strain, much better carbonation level, and much better flavor balance. Not quite a world-beater, but a delightful, solid, strong Belgian-styled brown ale that was remarkably difficult to keep from quaffing, as if it might be a 5% brown ale.  I doubt theyll ever match the beauty of the Unibroue 11, but this is a highly commendable effort.  Its difficult to win me over with strong Belgian browns, but this one has done it.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Also rater fruity and soft vinous with tones of dark grapes, cherries, apples, pears, plums/prunes and hints of banana. Just a whisper of wood, oak, flowers, citrus peel and earth are also notable. The flavour is caramelly/chocolate malty, complex spicy (ginger, nutmeg, white pepper and cardamom), yeasty, fruity/citric, earthy and light acidic. Quite lingering sweet with a tiny dry finish. The sweetness is syrup and sticky with notes of liquid brown sugar and over ripe dark fruits. The mouthfeel and body is quite full, well carbonated and light creamy.

2332,"2008-09-24",4.4,"750ml bottle, barely chilled. A foamy brown pour coalesces into half chocolate-hued liquid and half energetic, sandy cauliflower foam. Stiff 3D lace sticks to glass and lips with equal fervor. The bouquet enchants with spicy-citric-fresh hay hops, frolicsome oaky Chardonnay and yeasty wine cellar, seductive caramel and Merlot, and piquant orange soda and cotton candy scents. Sipping reveals oaky/malty and nutmeg/allspice flavors… also qualities of pistachio and reedy chamomile. A nipping alcohol sting adds elvish complexity. The palate proves a study of creamy fullness sharpened by fizzy carbonation and crabapple tartness. A smooth woody/fruity finish glides effortlessly into a buttery lychee aftertaste that smarts with overripe orchard fruit and leatherclad bondage. I would love to taste this hopped to IPA or DIPA proportions. Distantly similar, but far superior to- Unibroue’s previous caramel apple and sweaty-tasting anniversary ales.

Aroma of dried fruits, a bit yeasty and spicey, but also some unpleasant notes of leafs (almost rotten leaf). Not that pleasant and I wonder why I felt this way, since I have heard many good things about this beer. I shared it with a friend and he felt exactly the same. A bad  bottle, or did just some stupid imagination? Flavour is pretty sweet, quite vinous with a caramely maltiness but most of all dried fruits. It tastes better than the smell, but got some weak notes of these rotten leafs. Palate is a bit thin with quite much carbonation. This years biggest dissapointment. I have one bottle left, so lets hope the next one tastes good. 5/4/7/3/13=3,2

20090610: Second tasting. Pours a darkbrown color with a fantastic amber head. Aroma is really nice and vinous (mulled wine/redwine) with black and red currants, black currant leafs (not rotten, what was I thinking about last time?). Some caramel and sugar also. Flavour is quite sweet and malty but somehow the vinousity makes it balanced and I really love the black currant notes. Lightly yeasty. Very nice, smooth mouthfeel. Fullbodied and filling.

Medium body, watery texture turning slightly sticky. Lively carbonation. An interesting, flavorful Belgian-style beer. The downside is that the strong alcohol presence is a little too much.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"

It seems rather sharp but with a gentle fruit backdrop. The flavor is pretty aggressive coming from Unibroue. Lots of pronounced spiced and sharp notes cut through the mellow bready sweetness. I get hints at cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg,  coriander, licorice. I’m not sure if spices were actually used, but it makes me wonder. The palate is nicely heavy, not too sticky, but adequate.  The 10 % is very well hidden. It’s good to see Unibroue coming out swinging with this one. It’s strong and unique.

The flavor is peppery at first, with some licorice and alcohol, but it is quickly tempered by a very soft fudge-like flavor. There is a lemon zest note that comes and goes.

The taste begins with some mildly sweet apples, apricots and plums and then moving toward raisins and semi tart cherries. As the fruitiness transitions near midway a solid wheated malt note surfaces to break up the sweet and tart fruit. I seem to get both bandAid, a faint note of wood into the finish and a medicinal quality along the same lines as the band-aid note.

2332,"2008-08-20",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 21, 2008 Caged corked 750 ml. bottle, the date (December, 2010) along the right side of the bottle, on the cork is (REF 0706), sampled in a tulip glass.

L: Opaque reddish brown with some copper highlights near the stem of the glass, a tight creamy tan colored head that receded into a sudsy ring. Swirling the glass a few times causes the head to rise again. Splotchy layers of swiss cheese-like lace spirals around the brim of the tulip glass. 17 is quite attractive, an appealing, taste inducing appearance.

S: Sweetly lush aroma that opens up the nostrils. Smells of dark cherries, bubble gum, brown sugar and roasted pecans. Further whiffs brings out light touches of peppery spices. The alcohol has a rubber glue solvent scent. The nose is delectable enough to encourage me to have a taste.

F: Airy and moderate bodied, 17 has a smooth and rounded feel in the palate, the kind of quality mouthfeel one expects from Unibroue. The carbonation is active while being softly spry.

T: The taste, thankfully, is not as sweet as the nose portends, that is a mild sour acidity to it. Once again, dried dark sour cherries, spicy dark malts, chocolate nougat and brown sugar crystals. The alcohol is well hidden behind a warming peppery spiciness. A crisp and dry long lasting finish of sour cherries, nougat and roasted pecans, the nutty flavor really lingers in the mouth. 17 just screams dessert beer.

D: Im not sure if Seventeenth Anniversary ale will age as well as Fifteen or Sixteen, I think it is pretty close to ready right now. 17 is a nice departure from the other Unibroue Anniversary ales, unique and delicious tasting. I have no problem with recommending to anyone who likes Belgian Dark Strong Ales to pick up a few bottles, one to try now and a couple to store.  I plan to open a bottle of 17 during the coming Christmas holidays.","East Central, Georgia, USA","jpm30"

This is definitely one of the richest and fruitiest of the Unibroues and the yeast tastes quite different here than it did in any of the other anniversary beers.  there is a definite wheaty/weizenbocky quality to this brew, especially as it starts to warm up.  Smoky and wheaty with lots of molasses and fruity/rummy spiciness.  Very vineous and rich tasting.  As it warms you start to get a bit of cocoa and raisins.  Id like to try it again with a year or so on it, but its still pretty solid.  Further warming really brings it together though, a light minty/herbal quality picks up and integrates very nicely with all of the other  spicy/malty elements.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

2332,"2008-06-27",4.0,"75cl bottle courtesy of sandman2222. Pours a dark brown, almost black color with a thick, frothy tan head that recedes quickly but still provides lacing on the glass. Aroma is aged oak, malt, raisin, dark ripe fruit, barley. There is a slightly musty nature about it. Has a very creamy mouthfeel and notes of floral spice, sweet maltiness, hints of molasses. There is a note of sugar at the tip of the tongue but a slight sour finish. Notes of oak and wood emerge as the finish  unfolds and lingers. We also had the chance to sample bottles of Unibroue 15 and 16 with this bottle of 17. The 15 presented as very sweet with an overpowering phenol taste compared to the 17. The 16 presented as the perfect balance of sweetness, maltiness, and alcohol content. Color varied widely with the 15 the lightest (a yellow honey color) and the 16 presesting as a dark amber-caramel color. Overall, the 16 was our favorite of the three on this tasting.","Tampa, Florida, USA","kiefdog"
2332,"2008-06-25",4.0,"THOUGHTS: A wonderful beer. One of Unis better beers. This one might be really nice with some aging.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a nearly opaque, medium to dark brown with hints of orange and a huge, creamy, off-white head that slowly diminished and left good lacing. The aroma was moderate yeast, dark fruit, spices, maybe some port wine, slight alcohol and very light chocolate malt as it warmed. The initial flavor was lightly sweet, light to moderately acidic, and a little sour; while the finish was moderately sweet, lightly acidic and bitter, and sour with an average duration. There was dark fruit, then dark, sour fruit, spices and a little yeast. Maybe some brandy too and slight chocolate as it warmed. The medium to full body was syrupy up front then dry with rather fizzy carbonation and a lightly astringent and alcoholic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

Theres almost a canned tomato richness of malt...lots of toffee...and a slightly woody alcohol note like a light rye whiskey.  Just a stack of aromas layered, at once distinct but at the same time stuck together like a gooey baklava.  The flavour has a rich, deep fruitiness that melds brilliantly with toffeeish, almost oxidized malts.  Theres almost a sherry vinegar taste to this, but without the acidity.  Chocolate nuances come through with rum-soaked bread pudding. A firm and slightly hot alcohol note carves through the finish, not clean like usual but like a dull machete through jungle.  All the while, more layers are revealed, like a little gooseberry tartness and some brown sugar.  A fun beer showing a degree of style and nuance I havent seen from Unibroue in years, and yet still feeling like  Unibroue beer.  Spritziness makes for a finish thats a somewhat weak counterpart to the crazy fun the rest of the way through this beer.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

Almost like they took Terrible and added some to this (Terrible always has been very mushroomy for me). Flavors of earth and wood dominate, with a minor kick of fruits. Malts were sweet as well.

The malts are fruity and sweet, the malt flavors seem a little unsettled, as if they cant quite figure out what the balance of caramel to sweet should be. The hops are earthy. There is a slightly odd flavor here, it may be the beer needs more bottle aging, but it just doesnt seem to have that Unibroue character to it, it has the Unibroue yeast character but not the malt character.

A big bold nose of yeasty spices packed with a fruity and undeniable malt aroma. The flavor is so confusing and all over the map I dont even know where to begin. First, there is the large profile of yeast that ranges from wild farmhouse styled yeast towards a lab created spicy yeast that shows signs of pepper, clove and some kind of green leaf that has been dried and added in addition. There is also a strong dosage of smokey flavor and perhaps a barrel aged wood aftertaste of some sort that causes some scrambled messages to my head. The delivery of alcohol is so strong yet smooth just hits the spot and does the trick making it well worth the price for the bottle. Lastly, the appearance was a dark brown with small signs of sediment showing up towards the end of the bottle, and has a sticky layer of foam that leaves behind a trail of lacing all along the Trappist glass.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

There is dark malt, funky yeast, sourness, dark berry fruits, tart cherries and tannic aspects.  Very interesting.  Medium smooth body with quite a bit of carbonation.  The flavor starts with thick sourness that strikes me as a red wine backbone to the beer.  There is also some woodiness, graininess and abv warmth that is delicious and fitting.  The finish is very dry with leathery / tobacco traits.  This is a very complex and enjoyable brew.  Like mentioned earlier, this is not a typical beer for Unibroue, but it is excellent and stands up with the very best of their line.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

It poured very dark, and had a strong scent of roast malt and hop bitterness.

I cannot understand where they hide the alcohol in some of these beers, barely taste it. I believe I will pick up some to age. Tasty in a restrained flavourful manner.

Light and effervescent across the palate, nearly to much fizz in this one. A little more rigorous pour helps this one. Light caramel start with some vanilla and oak in the middle. Alcohol does show up a bit in flavors, but more so in the burn in the back of the throat. Some wheat and light acidity in the finish. Light white pepper in the linger. My second bottle, and I must admit that the first time I had it (approx. 3 weeks ago) I enjoyed it much more than I am right now. I caught more flavors the first time and the strength didnt seem to be as evident. As it stand now, a strong belgian ale with few faults, but but not grabbing my attention. I just realized that I am trying this one at a warmer temperature than last time. perhaps the alcohol does come out more as it warms and masks some of the flavors, but that does seem to go against conventional wisdom.

The flavour is equally complex, with intial impressions of coconut, and caramelized nuts, most notably almonds and pralines. Flavours of white grapes and apple also. The hops are very herbal and aromatic. Spices of corriander and possibly cardamom? The palate is a little hot and could use some aging. Other than that, this is a near-flawless Belgian strong.

The aroma is spikey from the immense alcohol rush that attacks the olfactory like the KISS Army at a Terre Haute, IN radio station.  Nice beige lacing clings to the glass to the final moment, its fingernail indentions leaving a delicate latticework of satiny lingirie strips around the Maudite tulip glass into which it was poured.  A rush of floral cherry bombards the taste buds, leaving orange peel and cinnamon in its wake.  The alcohol is noticeable, but never overpowering.  In fact, it serves to accentuate the delicate balance of flavors in this brew.  As the beer warms, a touch of cedar emerges and settles nicely on the tongue.  Thick, velvety mouthfeel.

2332,"2008-04-20",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Tart cherry fruitiness and chocolate maltiness waltz into raisiny territory in this intelligently spicy and rich Belgian-style Strong Ale. Another gem of the BSA style by Unibroue!

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sticky head of foam protects the dark brown.
-The yeasty touch is eloquent and works wonders with the maltiness.
-Expressive carbonation is detached at first, but a little breathing gets it back in line.
-That tart fruitiness evolves into salient black grapes.
-Mild alcohol brushes against the palate.
-Caramel sweetness protrudes from the chocolatey grain bill.
-This almost tastes like a Sour Ale was blended in a bigger Dark Belgian-style Strong Ale, in 20/80 proportions. Whatever the method used, the result is fantastic.

Eventually touches of chocolate, dark fruit, nuts and candi can be discerned, but I had to work for it. The finish is more sweet than dry, and theres definitely bitter.

Stong spiciness comes through in the flavour. Fruit, prune sweetness, warming alcohol. What I found different here from the previous Unibroue numbered seasonals is quite a bit of tartness.

2332,"2008-03-31",4.0,"Gingerbread, chocolate cookie dough, cinnamon, brown sugar, sweet floral characteristics and dark fruit notes all blend together with a touch of alcohol in the very inviting nose.  Opaque and somewhat muddy brown colour is topped by a generous, large bubbled, tan-cream coloured head that recedes slowly to a thick but partial cover with some spotty lacing.  Flavour offers some toasted malt and plenty of yeasty cookie dough and chocolate characteristics.  Fair bitterness reigns in the sweetness and keeps it from becoming cloying.  Plenty of dark fruitiness especially in the aftertaste.  Medium body with rather insistent but not unpleasant carbonation that really awakens the tongue.  Im finding this quite expressive although Im drinking it rather warm.  It only sat in the cellar for a couple of hours between purchase at room temperature and opening the bottle so its still quite warm.  Will be interesting to compare to the second bottle which Ill wait to cool down first.  Tulip glass.  Just below room temperature. (Brewery Creek, Mar-08).","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"

The flavor starts with lots of banana and light Unibroue yeastiness. The finish has an increased banana presence, brown sugar, dark fruit, nuts, apple, light alcohol, and a hint of smoke.  There is a very slight burn in the finish.  Medium bodied with moderate-heavy soft carbonation, which gives it a creamy mouth feel.  Obviously in the minority, but Im really digging this.

Either this needs aging for about 5 years, or it needs reformulated at the brewery. Alcohol hits you like a ton of bricks in the end.
Hey, Unibroue, hows about making a decent tripel instead of all these damn dubbels & dark ales? I think youre trying to cover up a flaw in your brewing process with all these dark ales.","","Cobra"

2332,"2008-03-02",3.0,"Objectively speaking:
A new brown Unibroue anniversary beer that plays a concerto of strong cereal nuances atop the usual yeastiness, but surprisingly limited in fruitiness. Not vinous, but still liquorous.


I like:
The usual authentic unibroue palate with lively, yet uniform carbonation. Relatively drinkable. Interesting cerealic (straight barley, wheat, vanilla touched oatmeal) leaning, though a bit unidirectional for now. Quite toasty.



I dislike:
Belgianesque beige head departs quicker than is usual for a Unibroue. Frankly not much complexity for a beer of this magnitude. Lacking in fruit notes. Very sweet cereal syrup feel.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
