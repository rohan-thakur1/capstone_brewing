4120,"2015-02-20",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2015 Bottle (375 ml). 2½ oz pour + 1 oz the day after opening the bottle. Thanks to Matt for the bottle!

Appearance: Deep purple with really nice legs. 

Aroma: A good amount of alcohol at first, but it then settle down as it breathe. Vibrant fresh tart cherries presence with some spiciness, herbal notes and honeyed sweetness. 

Taste: Sweet, but almost perfectly balanced by the acidity and the tartness of the cherries. Here again the cherries are fresh and vibrants. Light to moderate spiciness, honey, a bit boozy and some herbal presence. 

Palate: Medium to full body. Syrupy. Dryer than expected with a nice warming finish from the alcohol and the light spices. Despite being somewhat dry, theres still some lingering sweetness too (not cloying). 

Overall: This is a damn fine drink! A perfect sipper, except for the fact that its too drinkable. Its probably nearly impossible to do a better job at showcasing the Schaarbeek cherries. Complex, warming and so tasty! The only ""bad"" thing I can say about this one is that, for the price, its certainly not 3-4 x better than Black Agnes (in fact I would say that Black Agnes is almost as good if not as good). Now I cant wait to try Heart of Darkness. 

NOTE: It was as good if not better the day after we opened the bottle.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Tastes the same with the addition of mint honey (I know this ingredient was not used), caramel apples, and blueberry mixed drink.

Really nice almost no booze, great sweetness that matches well with the sour cherries certainly a top tier cherry used in this beer.

So juicy, so fresh, so pure; you get the sweetness of the flesh layered with the light tart-acidic aspect of the skins; a mild sharp, spicy tone with a strong, honey finish. The taste is incredible. Lovely combination of both sweet & tart. Fresh, ripe cherries & cherry juice, bursting with flavor.
