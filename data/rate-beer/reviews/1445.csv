A bit of a strange beer: the sweetness is relatively low and the bitterness relatively high, but theres not a lot of depth of flavour to back it up, so it comes across a bit thin. Smells sort of like a holiday ale, but the taste and body are more like a lager. Which, I guess, is bang dead nuts-on for the style, since alts are supposed to be brewed with ale yeast at lagering temperatures, giving a lager-ish flavour - but despite the relatively high bitterness, I cant say Im a big fan. Letting it warm didnt seem to improve it a whole lot. At best, a not uninteresting alternative to the same old - but I wont be stampeding out to buy it again. (12/20)","CANADA","UXO"

1445,"2014-12-25",3.5,"A deep copper, the brew pours clear and is finalized with a finger-deep, off-white cap. The foam is insignificant in minutes, but leaves a lacy trace of itself on the glass as it sinks.
The aroma is light banana, a nutty toast; and the flavor in the first sip is accented again with the banana, but I experience a dark fruit along with it. If it werent for the malty, alcohol afterward, I could almost imagine a fruit/yogurt/granola cup. Black currants sit foremost in the flavor for me, but touched with roasted nuts.
The palate is light, clean, and crisp; clearing from my taste buds in record time, but leaving a slight sere on my tongue. This isnt dry enough to be unpleasant, and the aftertaste sits as long as the dryness and then boom...gone. Nice trick, Ninkasi!
Im more impressed with this presentation from Ninkasi than I have been with some of their other styles, and I am glad to have found this.

1445,"2014-10-30",3.8,"Poured from bomber into a pint glass

Appearance  The beer pours a deep ruby red color, nearing on looking light brown, with a huge and creamy tan colored head that has an amazing level of retention. The head very slowly fades over time to leave a fantastic level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

Smell  The aroma of the beer is super heavy of a spent grainy smell mixed with some fruity aromas of a more dark stone fruit nature containing smells of cherry, plum, and fig. Along with these aromas come some notes of a roasted malt as well as a bit of molasses.

Taste  The taste begins drier then would have been expected from the nose, but just as grainy and malty as I would have expected. It begins with a slightly roasted and very grainy malt taste mixed with some light molasses sweetness. The graininess gets even more intense with a bit more roast and some hay coming to the tongue toward the end. Along with these flavors so too comes a bit of a warming alcohol taste as well as a loss of most of the molasses. In the end, with the transitions that occur, one is left with a very grainy and malty spent grain flavor to linger on the tongue.

Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the slightly thinner side for an altbier of 7.2 % abv. with a carbonation level that is on the average side. For the style a little bit of a thicker body may have been more traditional, but in light of the rather massive spent grain flavor, the lighter body was actually quite nice. 

Overall  Very malty and grainy with a lower level of sweetness. Not a bad altbier, but not the easiest drinking either. A nice one to try and good if you are not feeling anything sweet.","","Darkmagus82"

1445,"2014-01-26",3.2,"Reviewed from notes. Consumed 11/16/13.
The appearance is a fairly dark copper/brown colored body with a somewhat thin less than a fingers worth of head that dies practically within thirty seconds and leaves a decent amount of sticky lacing that eventually slides into the body.
The smell has a somewhat rich dark malty nuttiness, there seems to be some spice that I cant really tell what it is, just a sort of spiciness
The taste is a mostly malty sweet, the spice from the aroma comes back to balance it a bit, an ""altbier-like"" malty aftertaste, somewhat dry finish.
The palate is about a medium, somewhat sessionable, carbonation is good for the style and for me as its just not harsh or smooth, just right on.
Overall, good altbier for the most part, that I think I would come back to, unsure if Id actually buy it again, but just overall good","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

By itself I wouldnt pick this one as my drink of choice, but oddly enough when I began to drink it with food, I just happened to be eating Kerry Gold Dubliner Cheese and a Gala Apple, it was much more tolerable.

Nose strikes me as having quite a bit of leather and maybe some tobacco notes... prominent dark fruits with not as much caramel as I was expecting.

Flavor has more of the fruitiness at the front of the palate.. not as malty as I was hoping for either, but still pretty classy.. good complexities that I am having a hard time describing well.. it all mirrors the nose pretty much, I guess... the body is light given the bigger ABV.. but the carbonation really helps the drinkability.","Boise, Idaho, USA","JohnGalt1"

1445,"2012-09-18",3.2,"12/17/2009 - Not every beer at Christmas time can be an elegant Belgian concoction. The American brewers are hard at work too, and frankly, they probably know more about what you want than some faraway Europeans. Maybe. Santas European after all. If we dont quibble about nationalities though, its easy to find some merit in the American Christmas staples. Every season brewers release a slew of dark winter warmers. The variance between beers slims down considerably so that each glass is more like the last, but its a consistently good flavor, like that family recipe that gets reused every year. Its with this attitude of comfort (and complacency) that I begin to conquer a bottle of Ninkasis Sleighr Dark Double Alt beer. Its a dark beer, but colored more like a porter, with a cola looking brightness, and little to no head. The aromatic profile has a light smoke, a sprinkling of sweet, baked raisins, some dry but flavorful jerky, and a cool creaminess familiar to different kinds of savory dishes - mole, for example. The flavor is sweet at first, but the sugars quickly retreat. A blend of bitter hops and malts fill the void, bringing with them dark chocolates and unground coffee beans, followed by a sort of rasping, almost choking aftertaste that is generically bitter, and denuded of all the interesting flavors from earlier in the taste. For that reason I see pairing well with some other kinds of seasonal treats - brownies or nougat or something else that comes out of an oven with a 5 figure calorie count.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

1445,"2011-03-08",3.5,"03-May-10 (22-oz bottle: Purchased 30-Dec-09 for $5.80 at liquidsolutions.net) This beer is very caramely with fairly strong notes of dark chocolate, nuts, and a grassy hop bite with lingering, medium bitterness.  Even though the beer is decidedly malty, the resiny, hop bitterness is a bit harsh compared to the smooth, rich maltiness.  Medium in body and somewhat dry in the finish, but the carbonation is a bit on the prickly side.  Plenty of chocolaty malts in the nose, with some piney and grassy hop aromas much further in the background.  The beer pours over an inch of off-white head capping the very hazy, amber brown body.  Retention is solid, as the head settles slowly to a thin layer and wide ring while leaving plenty of dense, patchy lacing on the glass.

A moderate head of smooth, slightly spongy, dark khaki foam leaves sticky, broken bands of lacing on the glass.  The aroma is deliciously malty, yet dry, as notes of caramelized bread crust and yeasty, toasted dough lay a nice backdrop for complimentary chocolate, roasted nuts, and peppery, herbal spice notes.  Flavors follow that pattern, though seem brighter and more distinct, with a bevy of dark, dry bread and dough yeast notes being met with clips of biscuit, tea leaves, and dark fruits.  Theres a surprisingly staunch, peppery hop bite on the finish, intensified by the lively carbonation.  Just a shade shy of medium bodied, the palate tiptoes the line of substance and dryness beautifully.  Overall, I quite enjoyed this big lager.

1445,"2009-12-27",3.3,"Everyone in Portland was raving about this beer... I hadnt heard of Ninkasi until just this month... a fairly new brewery from Eugene.  I was told this was comparable to Jubelale and some people said it was superior.  I have to disagree... I think its possible that because Jubel has become such a Portland staple around Xmas that people were suffering from ""the new girl in the class"" attraction to Sleighr.  It isnt even the same style as Jubel for starters, so it is difficult to compare that way.  This is a very sweet double alt, and for my taste, it is too sweet, not enough hops, and it just felt a little flat to me.  Id drink it again if it were being served, but wouldnt go out of my way to buy it.  Disappointed in this offering.","Los Angeles, California, USA","slimweebs"

1445,"2009-11-27",3.2,"pours deep ruby brown with lasting white head. nice aroma of chestnut and biscuit malt. as i take a sip it is somewhat flat on the flavor. some hints of sweet dark fruit but it quickly cuts out. no finish at all. not bad but not a fav winter.","Vail, Arizona, USA","highibus"
1445,"2009-11-27",2.6,"Nice vanilla and licorice nose, but overwhelming alcohol backbone made it hard for these flavors to come forward.  Needs more chewable malt characterisitcs.","Seattle, Washington, USA","HungTuna"
1445,"2009-11-20",3.5,"Roasty, toasty malty backbone. Nice winter warmer with a lot of  body. A little caramelly, a little hoppy. Really fizzy on the tongue. Pretty solid, though I prefer their IPAs.","Washington, USA","killjoy966"
1445,"2009-11-19",3.3,"Pours mahogany into a pint glass (unfortunately, I have yet to find an alt).  Abundant but dissipating head.  Slight hop presence on the nose, little malty sweetness, spices, apple.  Man, oh man is this beer an oddball.  No detectable hops despite the aroma, only mild malty sweetness.  The prevailing taste is spiced apples.  Could really use some extra sweetness to balance out the spice.  Soft carbonation, fairly drinkable.  Doesnt seem to sit well on the stomach; bit too watery for the slightly detectable alcohol presence.  This would be great if it was richer and sweeter.  Not something to drink much of.  Perhaps relative, but this brew doesnt make me feel well at all.  Almost nothing doesnt sit well in my gut.  Disappointing end.","Idaho, USA","TLNash886"
1445,"2009-07-18",3.7,"Caramel, wheat toast, nutmeg (? some spice), a mlid mix of citrus and pine hops.
Almost brown, hazy, thin of white head. Light and crisp in the mouth (sharp contrast to the characteristically murky Jubel, Christmas in July at Micky Finns. (Black Butte XXI was there yesterday; Terminal Gravity Festivale waiting for the next open tap).
Take a schwarzbier, add spice, more hops than German, clean finish.","Portland, Oregon, USA","raphael"
1445,"2009-04-10",2.8,"Pint  Eastside Club Tavern  Olympia, WA
Aroma: Malty with a light hops aroma. Some spices where getting through.  
Appearance: Amber in color, Hazy with a thin head.  
Flavor: This had a very odd flavor for being a Alt this should have had more flavor. 
Palate: Dry finish, with a Odd Mouthfeel.  
Overall: I was not right with this beer it had something wrong either it was a bad keg or mixed and had the wrong stuff in it.  I think it was a mixed keg of two beers.","Olympia, Washington, USA","BrewDad"
1445,"2008-12-30",3.7,"Dark brown with a nice beige head. Roasty, toasty, bready aroma. Is pretty roasty with some light sweetness. A light fruity yeast is in this one too. A little warming sensation from the booze too.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"

1445,"2008-12-20",3.2,"Woody brown amber with evanescent top. Amber malt with a hint of hop aroma. Medium-bodied with some residual sugars. Fairly well-balanced, mildly hopped. More of an amber than anything. Not a bad change of pace seasonal selection. Quite drinkable. Pleasantly and mildly flavored.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
1445,"2008-12-04",3.6,"Holiday Ale Fest 08...  Poured brownish-ruby with an off-white head.  Aroma of brown sugar.  Very sweet with malt, cocoa flavors and had a chalky, dry finish.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
1445,"2008-11-29",3.7,"Green Dragon. Dark red/brown with a thin eggshell white head. Melted caramel, bready, and milk chocolate. Balanced hops in the finish, more bitter then floral. As the beer warms a bit of cherry shows.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
1445,"2008-11-20",3.3,"UPDATED: DEC 22, 2008 First review for this beer!!! Sampled on tap as my first birthday beer of the year at Good Times in Eugene this past monday. Very malty smelling and tasting and a little bit too sweet for my liking. Very warm and filling though, if not as complex as I would have liked. Not as good as Ninkasis IPAs or Oatis, but superior to Schwag, Spank Dog and the like. I imagine Ill be drinking more of these and possibly altering my rating later this winter.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","Beardface"
