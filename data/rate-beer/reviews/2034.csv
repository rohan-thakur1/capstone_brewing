2034,"2015-10-03",3.9,"Draft at Ei8ht Ball, served in a flight. Pours a deep cloudy brown with a small tan head that settles into a ring and island of film, leaving lace streaks in the glass. Very malty - roasted, toasted, chocolate, caramel - with nuts, earth, oak, light vanilla, and tobacco. Medium-bodied, with low to moderate carbonation and a toasty, rich mouthfeel. Its already a big, rich brown ale and that character isnt overpowered here. Its a subtle barrel treatment. Nice.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
2034,"2015-08-11",4.0,"Tap at brewery. Orange brown with thin ring. Brown sugar, oak, molasses and smoked malts. Taste is lightly sweet with a smoky dry finish. Body is medium with a sticky feel.","St Paul, Minnesota, USA","Nsanders"
2034,"2015-04-23",4.0,"Draught at Whole Foods, Lexington. This was really good. Very rich with deep chocolate and whiskey notes. Creamy mouthfeel. Taste really lingers.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
2034,"2015-02-23",3.9,"Tap at Republic. Thick sweet chocolate nose, burnt wood, ash, some good barrel notes, and just a touch of light sweet coffee. Black, with a creamy dark tan head. Very pretty. Chocolate, serious roast malt, mild hop. The barrel is very nice, not overdone. Medium body, creamy, and smooth on the tongue. This drinks like a heavy porter or light stout rather than a brown ale. Delicious.","Hirakata, JAPAN","maekchu"
2034,"2015-02-22",3.7,"Pour on tap at Republic, dark brownish pour with tan head, aroma brought smoke, bourbon, caramel, some vanilla into a bit of cocoa powder, dark fruits, touch of nutty notes. Taste was a mix of caramel, toffee, oak, bourbon into a bit of cocoa, slight earth into some nutty notes, finishing smoky, slightly sweet.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
2034,"2015-01-04",3.8,"Sampled from the tap at the brewery. Pours black with a brown head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has bread and a bit of dark grains backed by a bit of whiskey/sweetness. Flavor has dark bread and dark grains with a nice whiskey finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
2034,"2014-09-13",3.9,"Opaque, chestnut hued pour. Bourbon oriented aroma with raisins, cherry, vanilla and coconut. Butterscotch, toffee, and milk chocolate detail the rich malt foundation. A bright bathing of citrus lingers in the way that sneakily high hop levels can go unnoticed in a beer like this. Resin and brown sugar drippings; there is seemingly a lot of everything here, and the balance that is calmly maintained is impressive.
Bittersweet, oily hazelnut skin flavor; less barrel influence than the noisy nose. Chocolate, musty earth, sackcloth. Amidst the decadent, regal sweetness there is a definitive rustic edge that lends character and depth. Prune, beet, and maple syrup interact with orange zest and pine to again illustrate the surprising assertiveness of hops here.

Carbonation is ample and the body has a spirited velvety quality, without being sticky or cloying. The finish lands on an earthy note of oak that extends dryly for a good while. The assertiveness of this example can seem too gregarious at times, but if considered as a strong brown ale, it isnt fair to consider this a flaw. This is interesting, confident, provocative stuff that seems to define this brewery as one with both the desire and the competency to challenge boundaries and horizons.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
2034,"2014-07-04",3.4,"4 or 5 oz. pour, on tap at the brewerys taproom. Consumed on 7-3-14. Pours dark brown with beige head. Produces nice lacing. Raisin dominates the aroma. In fact, this is one of the most raisin-like beers I have ever smelled. Tart cherry and vanilla scents. Dark chocolate with tart cherries and a touch of coffee in the flavor. Raisin and bread pudding flavor elements. Boozier than ideal but otherwise tastes interesting and good. Alcohol heat in the finish. Becomes lighter, fruitier, and worse upon multiple sips, verging toward Fruity Pebbles. Medium body. Lively, soft, and frothy in the palate. My main takeaway is that this beer is too ""hot."" Its immature and requires more aging.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
2034,"2014-06-27",4.0,"Tap at Hammerheart. Super dark pour with a spotty head. Sweet whiskey on the aroma. Some nuttiness and then more whiskey late on the taste. Decadent.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
2034,"2014-06-14",4.0,"As expected this is very much like the original, with the nice subtleties of the whiskey barrels evident in the aroma and the taste. Its nice because you arent clobbered over the head with the barrel additions, but rather the brown ale qualities still come through in the end. The taste moves into a mild cocoa finish, drying out with some chalkiness. Very nice overall.","Minnesota, USA","Ericular"
