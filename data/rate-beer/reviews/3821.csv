3821,"2016-06-06",4.3,"750mL bottle at a tasting. Pours a glowing, hazy, bright pink with light pink erupting foam. Sweet pink grapefruit nose is zesty and fresh hitting that perfect aroma for me. I guess Brett plus berries here creates that more sweet grapefruit aroma. Flavor is acid and bubbles up front, moving to nondescript berry medley in the mid. Quicker finish with good balance - not a citric lemon bomb. Really loved this one.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3821,"2016-02-28",3.9,"Bottle @ RBWG 2016. Thanks to Joe for this. Bright reddish beer that does indeed look like fruit punch. A layer of pink foam, too. Theres a whole lot of blackberry, cherry, and lemon. A bit acetic, but the fruits really dominate and shine. Maybe a light spice and pie filling thing going on. I dig it.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

3821,"2015-10-31",3.3,"750 ml bottle thanks to AdamC. Hazy Amber/ red pour, almost no head. Aroma is very acidic oak with hints of blackberry. Wow... Sharp acidic notes, oak tannin with sharp pucker in the taste buds. Red wine vinegar... If you just want to drink vinegar go to your local supermarket and grab some off the shelf. How high is this rated? What? Why? I really like this brewery and have been in person but not sure what the huge deal is here. This is NOT a saison... Sour wild ale... Yes.

3821,"2015-10-31",3.5,"750ML acquired in a trade. Zero gushing and split 6 ways at fridge temp.

A - The appearance is like a strawberry / cherry juice. Hazy, a little yellow appearance. a 2 finger head that fades fast to a thin line with some bigger bubbles. 

S - The aroma is acidic, sharp, juicy and a lot of berry in this one. I get a bit of hat oak from the cask 200 puncheon. 

T - The berry fruit salad is certainly presence. Sharp, acidic and too sour for me but the fruitiness is really interesting and Im enjoying the berliner weisse. oak and wine characters at the end.

M - Thin, a very sharp bubbly feeling and an oily finish.

O - I expected this to be too sour. Some of the base Cask 200 variants when fresh were pretty awesome and after some time, they get a bit too sour and I think the berries just took it over the edge.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

3821,"2015-10-28",3.5,"Pours a cloudy red with a small rim that leaves low lacing. Nose is of rubber, fruits and vinegar. Taste is of red fruits and moderately acid. Like natural unsweetened raspberry juice. Lemony. Body is light to medium, carbonation moderate and mouthfeel is certainly vinous. Acidity level is almost sharp and I found it to be lacking a bit of complexity. I did not enjoy it that much in the end because of all that...A good american sour maybe, but a saison?","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

3821,"2015-06-15",4.2,"Bottle thanks to Jared.
Light red pour with quickly dissipating head. 

Very tart, with lots of berry flavors, IT tastes a few ounces for your palate to adjust to the tartness, great berry aroma. 

The tartness however doesnt balance the fruit and im afraid some of the delicate nuances in the boysenberries and blackberries are destroyed. That is what is preventing this from entering the 4.4+ rating area.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"

Aromas and flavor are blackberry, strawberry jam, sweet tarts, sour blueberries, pink lemonade and funky oak. Mouth watering tart minerals and ultra clean rock salts left behind in the mouth.

3821,"2015-04-25",4.2,"750 ml. bottle at home. It pours a nice deep strawberry red color with a small, fizzy pink head. The aroma jumps out with a surprising amount of funk, barnyard, cheese and of course lots of fruity dark berries. The flavor is definitely Cantillon-like with huge puckering acidity, great fruit character and mild background notes of funky cheese. Theres not really any strong mineral character to the mouthfeel, and it actually has a little bit of body due to the higher gravity I suppose. No acetic acid or solvents. The finish is spectacularly tart and fruity. As it warms it becomes more and more apparant how perfectly this beer is named. Fruit Punch is spot on. While this is undoubtedly a GREAT American sour beer, none of the four rateable categories blew my mind, however the overall beer is greater than the sum of its parts if that makes any sense... Delicious stuff.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3821,"2015-04-10",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2015 Bottle at the brewery. Aroma is rather fruity with a great berry character, but also a light poopy, sulfur aroma. Some light tropical fruit and citrus with a hint of phenolics. Pours a cloudy purple red with a small, moderately thick, pinkish head with decent retention as it recedes to the edges. Medium lacing and small legs. Flavor has medium light acidity with quite a bit of berry fruit notes. Light pale malt notes with some light citrus and tropical fruit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Overall, a very delicious berry saison. Lots of jammy, berry notes but the base beer?s character shows through nicely.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3821,"2015-04-10",4.5,"Bottle. Pours quite hazy deep magenta, small pink head, good lacing. Aroma is cantillon like, funky, horse blanket, basement, fruity, but no real specificity. More raspberry than anything. Flavor is medium tart, dry, light plus funk, super fruity, blueberries and other fruits, really smooth. Nice lingering tart funkiness. This is Saras answer to Lou Pepe, and it competes well. Kudos.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3821,"2015-03-12",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 24, 2015 Half pour on draft (March 1, 2015) and from the bottle. Aroma has medium jammy quality, with an edge toward the boysenberries, than seedy blackberry. There is a nice stone fruit presence as well which I take as the base beer poking through a bit.  Not much funk coming through on draft but the bottle has huge barnyard funk to the tune of Cantillon Lou Pepe Framboise. The beer pours hazy purple/red with off white head that goes to the sides of the glass. Taste is berry pie, berry preserves, light tropical fruit note, lacto/brett funk, and rich boysenberry. The blackberry comes through in the form of the seedy jam. Nice mélange of berry flavors with moderate drying oak tannin. The body is medium-full with medium-high carbonation. After taste is funky berry, medium acid. Awesome beer and even better out of the bottle!","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
3821,"2015-02-14",4.2,"On tap at Lupulo. Pours crimson purple with a whitish pink head. Funky jammy aroma with egg tarts and berry pie. Flavor follows, soft greek yogurt with blackberries and a bit of blueberry skins. Delightful!","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
