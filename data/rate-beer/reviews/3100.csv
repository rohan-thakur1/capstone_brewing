Taste/Palate:

3100,"2016-09-26",4.0,"This was poured into a becher pint glass.
The appearance was a dark chocolate milky looking color with a sly brown tint to it. A thin edged off white to white foamy head started and dissipated. Spotty lacing runs here and there.
The aroma starts off with some roasty coffee bean blending with some smoked malts. Sly sweet meat slides in to balance nicely.
The flavor starts sweet and leads to a nice balance of smoke. Meaty portion tends to blend subtly with a crisp sweet aftertaste. Nice sweet and smoky finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionably smooth sweet feel just rolling stealthily over my tongue. Beautifully and wonderfully done mouthfeel! Carbonation seems to hit spot on.

Theres nothing else here to balance out the prominent bandaid/phenols which are really unpleasant. Almost all of the other dark malt notes are completely overshadowed. 

Full bodied with a slightly creamy texture and a very intense burnt/smoke flavor. Really overwhelming with strong acrid unpleasantness. Everything tastes like burning! Charred toast, burnt malt, charcoal burnt wood and ashtray. Really strong but the phenol presence isnt as bad as expected. Its there but not as offensive as it is in the aroma.

3100,"2015-08-13",5.0,"Large beautiful and impressive light brown foam. I love Jeppe s (master brewer) own description of this beer: Unlikely viscous, seductive dark and smoking good. Yes a real heartbreaker. We recommend that only really trained beerchamps can take on this fiendishly addictive and overwhelming good smoked stout. Beware, many experience a slight placebo effect if swallowed.
Am I a well-trained beerchamp? I do not know, for it is not a term I have used on myself. Otherwise, I fully agree with the description. It is viscous and seductive and really smoked. It is a Nils Oscar Rökporter and a Aecht Schlenkerla at the same time, namely with a good deal of smoked malt. A little to the cool side, where you almost feel what it must feel like to lick the skin from a smoked eel. Overwhelming good, it is also because there is left room for coffee flavor and dark bitter chocolate. Addictive I would also like to join. Especially on a cold autumn or winter evening. It brings namely warmth and comfort throughout the body, and it is certainly addictive in the long term. The placebo effect is immediately worse to relate to, for is it not something that, for example. ill patients may feel themselves healthy just by the belief that the doctor prescribed calcium tablets is a newly developed wonderful medicine? If Jeppe therefore believe that beer drinkers can be tricked into thinking that Ashtray Heart is a profound delicate smoked stout, which in reality is brewed from coincidences, then he is mistaken. I can taste that this is really good and well-brewed craft beer. So maybe Im actually a well-trained beer champ!","Valby, DENMARK","TorbenJensen"

It might pour the solid unrelieved black of a politicians heart, but it has far less smoke than Id expect of such an organ.

It settles with more than two thirds foam atop an inky back body. Highly carbonated (well unexpected), the head is fuelled for the length and this gives the palate a prickly, champagne-like effervescence. Good body underneath, but remains masked. Hot, fusel alcohol burn to the finish is a little harsh. Smoky, ash-tray and charred, smoke-house meats dominate the flavour. Peaty, earthy and robust. Lasting with woody, nutty notes coming through and a little dried, mace and cassia bark spice lingering on the tongue keeping it lively. This is the first Evil Twin Ive actually enjoyed.

What an odd commercial description...this is anything but rich or overpowering. The reality is its a fairly plain, simple, easy-going porter, despite the high ABV. And labeling this as a Smoked beer is misleading, as there is virtually no smoke at all that I can detect.

Once again thanks to malrubius for opening this nice smoked beer. Always a fan of Evil Twins work I do not get a chance to drink them that often because of the price point. However as long as they keep making their way overseas I will be sure to pick up a draft from time to time to support one of the best in the business today.

Aroma / Appearance - The inky black base was sticky with a tan mocha head. Heavy and thick it sticks in the glass like an oily fog. Ash, cigarettes, dark chocolate, and little bits of olive are a combination of mostly dark and mysterious characteristics.

Flavor / Palate - Ash, chocolate, and peat linger in the air. The dry transition carries the experience to a profile like the air in a seedy nightclub just after closing time at 4 AM. Musty and chewy waves of texture are perfect for a beer of this caliber. All told it is a world class release although one that I would probably pass on again just because of the price.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3100,"2013-09-01",3.6,"Bottle. Very lively near-black pour, finely bubbled medium brown head that eventually settles into a rocky flotsam. Aroma is ashy-smoke with underlying sweetness. The palate is smoke-dominated, and the term ashtray isnt too far off the mark. There is an acrid quality to the smoke here, but this is buffered by silky smooth and sweet malts, chocolate and dark caramel and molasses. Nice, but the balance could be a bit better, or maybe its the quality of the smoke that I find less than ideal.

3100,"2013-06-16",3.5,"11.2oz bottle, from Party Town for $9. Best before 2015. Black body. Super-huge brown head. Ah... I see this was brewed at De Molen. Should have poured more carefully. Looks great anyway, despite being awkward to drink. Surprisingly sweet taste, very sweet. Its like they took a sweet stout, maybe a double milk chocolate one, and added a buttload of smoked malts to it. I love the huge amount of smoke in this, but Id much rather it be in a big roasty bitter reasonably hoppy imperial stout. Some light molasses type flavor adds a bit of unpleasantness to the cloying sweet for me. Bigger body. Lighter, smooth kind of creamy carbonation. Lightly sticky in the finish. Ive heard some people say that this tastes like an ashtray. No, not really. Id say its moderate to stronger strength smoke - I could imagine smokier. Its not the smoke that bothers me about this beer though, surprisingly, its the heavy sweetness that makes this harder to drink. Still delicious though. I really like smoked beers.

Tones of both chocolate and leather as well. Milk chocolate actually. When tasting it, the smoky ashy tones really makes its way in the flavor. Its almost like a stingy-cigar, quite warming with lots of licorice. Quite interesting and tasty with a soft, silky almost cloying texture. Not because its to sweet, but it just got a bit much in the end. Actually struggled towards the finish with this one.

3100,"2012-04-06",3.5,"11.2 oz and served in my Ommegang tulip: Pours nearly opaque with a huge fluffy tan head which left okay lacework upon the glassware. The aroma has a intense aroma of peated malt, herbal and grassy hops, some chocolate, coffee, woody, earthy, leathery and prune esters. The taste displays a robust smoky quality and some classic iodine peat notes along with a twangy dark fruit presence. Honestly I was afraid this would be overbearing right from the get go but the smoked malts do allow for some of the richer sweet malts to make a appearance as well as some hop bitterness. It is upon the long finish that you do get knocked about the head by the smoky peat tones.  The mouth feel is a tad oily and surprising thin for the genre, ashy as expected and a tad metallic as well. Really, I like this beer for the first part of the glass but find drinking more than 6 ounces a bit of an effort as it starts to become one note and palate fatiguing, reduced the overall score to a lack of drinkability.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Tremendously huge head (despite my best efforts to control it during the pour) that is dark tan in color and pillowy, yet dense in texture.  As head settles somewhat, a good bit of lacing remains.  Aroma is of peat and licorice, with some piney, resinous character in the background.  Smoky, but not in a salty, rauchbier way.  As pronounced as the aroma was, I was completely unprepared the for wallop of flavor.  Strong doesnt even begin to describe how it hit me--flavor of sour cherries mixed with smoked wood.  Some roasted malts are evident, as is hop bitterness, but there is really a sour-sweet flavor taste driving the beer.  Its rather unexpected to be honest.  Although the alcohol is not--very forward.  Palate is also unexpected, as the beer is surprisingly watery.  In sum: A flavorful smoked stout, but one that may not be to everyones liking.

I highly doubt it will be ""overpowering"" enough to ""make invalids out of supermen"" as Evil Twin puts it. The initial pour into the tulip glass is very nice. Its an extra dark beer with a mountainous, rocky tan head. The aroma is not very smoky, considering the style. Ive smelled imperial stouts just as roasty and meaty as this which dont actually employ smoked malt. The aroma is a little fruity and tart with notes of cacao, nuts and espresso. There is a bit more smoke in the flavor, but its not standout. It just provides some oomph to the already roasty character of the malts. There is this weird sort-of metallic and acidic flavor that I find in a lot of Danish beers. This beer has a lot of potential and is ultimately enjoyable  but is rough around the edges. Also, this needs more smoke. See Yazoo Sue to learn how a black smoked ale should be.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Medium to fuller bodied with a sticky, somewhat thick palate that dazzles the tongue with just a tad of carbonation and a huge amount of heat from the smoke. The flavor leans heavily upon the smoke flavors, but they are quite nuanced, and some hints of the cherry, coffee, and chocolate show up, as well as a very modestly sour or tart finish from the creamy lactose. The alcohol is hidden in plain view, but youd be damned to guess it was close to 9%. This is definitely a sipper, and meant to be shared on a cold night.
