3520,"2013-08-07",3.3,"On tap at Hair of the Dog. Hazy deep amber. Aroma reminds me of black-currant candy. Taste is smoky, malty, slightly sour with a clean dry finish. Thin and watery body. Different from the types of milds Im used to, but not bad.","Waterloo, Ontario, CANADA","kevinsenn"
3520,"2013-07-06",3.2,"Draft at the source. Hazy amber color, thick tan head. Aroma of lightly burnt toast. Taste is similar. OK.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
3520,"2013-06-02",3.3,"Draft at HOTD.  Pours dark brown (not quite so dark as adam, but pretty close) with ample off white head.  Aroma of ... well, Adam, but dialed back 70%.  Smoke, leather, tobacco, etc.  Taste is a little rough and muddled, following the nose, hitting the tongue in a way that isnt particularly strong -- middle of the road with regards to sweetness and bitterness, not leaving a big impression.  Light/medium body, average carb, smooth texture is a little bit thin.  Wouldnt quite call it refreshing, and wouldnt quite call it crisp, but it would be awfully easy and pleasant to drink several of these.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
3520,"2013-03-06",3.3,"On tap, orange color with some frothy foam, aroma is malty dry fruit, sweet light flavors of malt, earthy, grain and leather, better than the description sounds","Dallas, Texas, USA","blutt59"
3520,"2012-12-06",3.4,"A hazed dirty brown ale wit a thin off white head. In aroma, nice grainy malt with light British hops. In mouth, a nice roasted malt with grainy notes, light rye, British herbal hops, nice. On tap at brewery, Oct. 7 2012.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
3520,"2012-11-14",3.1,"Tap at Hair Of The Dog, Portland - 06/11/12. 
Murky chestnut brown with a thin off white head that soon clears to the edge.
Nose of leather, tobacco, toffee, sweet sugars and light honey tones.
Taste follows and also incorporates light wood, toffee and a pinch more tobacco.
Light body with little carbonation a little on the thin side.
A bit of a let down in all honesty.","Hazlemere, the lower Xhitlerns, Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Theydon_Bois"
3520,"2012-10-26",3.5,"Draft at the brewery. Pours a muddy brown with a small white head that leaves a slight ring and film. Light aroma. Notes of nuts, chocolate, toast, and leather. Flavor of light smoke, leather, chocolate, nuts, and earth. Light bodied, with moderate carbonation and a light, earthy mouthfeel. Nice mild ale.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3520,"2012-06-28",3.8,"had at the tap room. Poured from tap into a pint glass. Pours a great amber color with a real good head.

Well balanced and classic bitter notes of toffee, caramel, malts and some biscuits. Very nice depth considering the abv.

Very good feel, but lacking some depth on the flavors of malts, toffee, and caramel.

Its shocking how much flavor is brought at 3.2%. Seriously, its a massive achievement and this is just a real good beer on the whole. This is a picture perfect session brew.","","Newk"
3520,"2012-04-23",3.1,"My Bottom Line:
Resinous hops and light, earthy malts surround discreet fruit and straightforward yeast flavors.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the turbid reddish brown.
-This is not nearly as interesting as the best Mild Ales or Bitters out there. Then again, it might not have been in the best condition either. Its hard to tell. The first glasses from this keg were nearly all yeast...
-Adams complex malts are sadly impossible to identify.
-Wooden hop bitterness is much higher than expected.

On tap at the Siboire, in Sherbrooke.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
3520,"2012-04-22",3.2,"Verre de 10 oz, dun fût au Siboire. Arômes de malt légèrement torréfiés et fumés et de houblons terreux et boisés. Robe brunâtre très trouble, peu de mousse et effervescence moyenne. En bouche, le houblonnage se montre très présent mais pas particulièrement attrayant, contribuant des notes terreuses et épicées. Il y a également beaucoup de levure en suspension, ce qui engendre une certaine astringence et diminue la fraîcheur des autres saveurs. Le malt, très svelte, apporte des notes torréfiées et chocolatées. Finale relativement amère de houblon terreux. Je mattendais à beaucoup plus de cette bière.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MJGG"
3520,"2012-04-10",3.0,"3 oz. sample at Hair of the Dog tasting room, pours a dark amber / orange brown with a small off-white head. Aroma of leather, dry rye malt and maybe some horse blanket. Flavour of dry rye malt, leather and quite a musty, dirty note on the finish. Smooth, but with a bitter finish. My least favourite of the Little Dogs (thus far). Decent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
3520,"2012-04-04",3.7,"12oz pour at HotD. Pours a hazy, brown colr with a big light tan head and lots of lacing. Aroma is malty, bread. Medium on the palate with soft, creamy carbonation. Flavor is sweet, malty, smokey, nutty, with a nice smokey finish that lingers. Very tasty, and at 3.2%, very drinkable.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","sherm1016"

3520,"2011-06-25",3.5,"On tap @ Hair of the Dog. Clear amber brown with a beige head that leaves some lacing. Aroma of toast and bread dough with light smoke and herbal hops. Flavor is more toasty malt with a mellow hop bitterness. Light body with average carbonation and a slightly watery mouth feel. Pretty good session beer, nice and light but full of flavor.","Anchorage, Alaska, USA","savnac"
3520,"2011-06-07",3.6,"On tap at the tasting room.  Pours dark brown with a compact, foamy white head.  The appearance is pretty dark, only shades of mahogany are visible when you hold it up to the light, otherwise from the right angle this looks like normal Adam.  Aroma is grassy hops and peat.  Normal Adam smokiness is apparent underneath the herbal contribution from hops.  Does not have the deep, complex malt flavors normal Adam does, just the smoke.  Flavor is bitter, slightly chocolate and malty with a prickly mouthfeel from the hops and smoke.  Fairly light bodied.  This is certainly the hoppiest little dog I can remember having.  Interesting and very different than regular Adam.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"
3520,"2011-05-24",4.2,"Draft @ brewpub: Deep pumpernickel. Staggering nose of Toffifay candy, bread crust, pipe tobacco, candied pecans, cacao nibs, vibrant peat, molasses and prunes. Robust wafting of earthy hops, as well. Firm prickles of carbonation. Soft earthy malt gives way to a voluptuously layered toffee-glazed nuttiness and earthy peat-and-pipe-tobacco fusion. Malt persists and lends a bread crust bitterness which mirrors the pungent but clean apricot-tinged hop punch. Whispers of smoke reverberate gracefully beneath the beefy malt. Surreally complex, yet immensely quaffable due to the delicate underlying maltiness as well as a nice counterpoint of hop acids, molasses-doused prunes and polished esters. Malt continues to blanket the palate, bolstering the endless layers of grassy peat and pipe tobacco with dabs of cacao nibs and dry chocolate. The divine texture of the malt, with its soft and sumptuous nut-and-vanilla-cookie interplay, cannot be overstated. Gorgeous marriage of gentle char and gritty caramelized sugar comprise the finish. Take Adam, one of the worlds most flavorsome and characterful beers, and reduce it to circa 4% while achieving the same astonishing complexity? This is a masterpiece of low-gravity brewing, and an extraordinary accomplishment. Im gonna have to move Portland.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

3520,"2011-03-30",3.6,"Thanks to Kan for this growler... Pours a medium brown, hint of dark orange. A light top head, nice collar, a thin cap. Ok lacing... The aroma is like a light smoked lager, great smoke that you cant get enough, doesnt overpower. A hint of rye and tea... The taste is super light, not much flavor except for the finish which is lightly smoked. A litter bitter quality, and tea finish. Not a huge fan of the taste, but considering its a 3.5% great taste... The mouthfeel is really nice, medium bodied, not light at all... Crushable.

This is a great and flavorful session beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
3520,"2011-02-24",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2011 Tap @ HotD...  Poured a brownish/amber with a thin, off-white head.  Aroma was malty with a decent yeast spice.  Hops were mild, in background for balance and slightly floral. Still a decent smoked/leather tone similar to Adam.  A grainy finish with hints of cocoa and light esters.  Quite the true session beer. I think the English would approve.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
3520,"2011-02-21",4.0,"Growler from Kan! Pours hazy ruby with small head. Aroma has a really nice cherry wood smoked malt quality, hints of brown sugar and plums. Flavor follows through with the cherry wood smoked malt character, licorice, plum skin, and tobacco. Resiny hop bitterness finishes. Watery feel, long palate as this beer packs a wallop of flavor at 3.5abv. Pretty amazing really but perhaps it shouldnt be all that surprising with how great the malt bill has always been. Just a little surprised by the smokiness. Great session brew!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
3520,"2011-02-21",3.8,"Growler fill courtesy of my main Portland trading partner... Pours a medium transparent orangey caramel brown with a thin soapy whit head that quickly dissipates to a thin wispy haze... Light smokey aroma with semi-sweet grainy/fruity bent to it. Light and not too assertive... Flavors are along a similar framework with a tad more than assertive smokey feel, light grains through the middle, some pale fruit akin to apple, and a semi-dry fruity type of bitterness. Thin bodied, obviously, with a lighter consistency. Carbonation has held up as well. Very easy drinking and resembles a very light smoked lager.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
