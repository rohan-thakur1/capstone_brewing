1904,"2014-06-23",2.9,"This beer is a cloudy orange brown color in the class. Its head is small and made of fine bubbles. There is a bit of hops in the nose. I am maybe even getting a bit of citrus which is odd for the style but not bad. I notice this has a bit of a buttery thing going on which I dont think is intentional but also isnt disastrous. It is nice and dry w/ a firm bitter finish. These guys are a great brewery but this one missed the mark just a bit for me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

1904,"2014-01-09",4.2,"This is a major go-to beer for me. Ive had it at the Wolpertinger and Heritage fests, at bars and restaurants, from growlers, and many times at the brewpub. If I see it, Im drinking it, and its always reliably delicious. Poured into a nonic pint glass like the good lord intended it: a light golden amber colour with thin but persistent white head, lasting with nice lacing. Way more flavour than youre used to with American Pale Ales, in the malt department (VERY biscuity, toasty, nutty, faint caramel and slight residual sweetness) and the hops department (perfect bittering balance, English-style orange marmalade flavour, but with some subtle grassy, black-pepper, black-currant flavours and aromas.) Pleasant fruity esters. Light-medium body, average carbonation, exquisite mineral water and tea like tannin aspects, with a lingering bittersweet aftertaste. A damn-near perfect pint o bitter, and fresh as fuck. Mmmmm.Earlier Rating: 11/2/2012 Total Score: 3.6Tasted on tap at brewpub in nonic half-pint glass. It poured a nice orange color with a little chill haze, thin but persistent white head and lots of lace. 100% true-to-style aromas and flavors: malty, biscuity, nutty, great tangy balance of Centennial and EKG hops, earthy, flowery, citrusy, with distinctly English fruity ale yeast esters. American bittering hops (not too much grapefruit) + English aroma hops = best of both worlds. Low-medium body and carbonation, bready and well-rounded mouthfeel, very crisp snap at the finish. Nicely done. Id love to taste a cask-conditioned version.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"

The aroma is grainy rough malt, a bit of iced tea character and spicy floral hops fainter in the back.  The taste is mostly the malt, lightly sweet, grainy rough, and more of the iced tea type flavor.  The hops are present towards the end, giving it some floral and drying out the finish.
