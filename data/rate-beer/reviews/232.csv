232,"2017-06-17",3.5,"Pint can. Clear penny copper color with a fading white head and large bubbles. The aroma hits you with cucumber and mint, backed up with a touch of hay. The flavor is like the water at a nice hotel, cukey and minty. Some sweet bready malt plays a supporting role. The palate is smooth like silk, with just a touch of prickly carbies. For this beer, may or may not be your cup of...um...cuke water, but the mission they set out to accomplish was accomplished. If youre looking to cuke til you puke, this is the cuke you want.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
232,"2017-05-21",3.7,"It pours quite dark for a Kolsch, almost amber. The aroma has a lot of fresh bright cucumber, mild malt and mild spice. It has a light crisp body with semi sharp carbonation. The taste has more of a beer taste to it with more spice, cracker malt, mild sulfur and herbs. The cucumber is the but more of a minor component. Tasty.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
232,"2017-03-17",2.6,"Dark golden clear pour with quick white foam. Strong cucumber in the nose with some faint malt and hops. Light body, active fizz, moderately crisp finish. The cucumber flavor is strong but never quite harmonizes with the hops. The malt is in the background. I never tasted any coconut flavors. The taste never quite came through for me.","Pennsylvania, USA","PanMarek"
232,"2017-02-18",3.6,"16oz can pours with a crystal clear pale gold body that supports a thin white head of foam. The aroma offers up plenty of cucumber and it seems the cucumber skin is noticeable as well. Well behind that note is a sense of malts and vague to spicy hops. The taste delivers a pleasing degree of cucumber flavor that seems refreshing until the overly sweet and less crisp and clean maltiness comes forward to side track the Kolsch experience Im trying to have. Into the finish the cucumber notes persist and allow a sneak peek at some faint floral to spicy hoppiness. The level of cucumber and cucumber flavor are really nice but the beer behind it is just too sweet and sluggish for a Kolsch. Darn.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
232,"2016-10-31",3.5,"Can, slightly hazy amber beer, decent white head, some lace. Aroma is malt and squash, touch of honey. Taste is malt, squash, cucumber. Palate is light, carbonation moderate.","Eagle River, Alaska, USA","furthur"
232,"2016-10-27",2.6,"Sampled at GABF 2016 with Paul and Larry. Pours a light golden body with thin lace. Nose is super light and muted - maybe some spice and light sweetness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with notes of veggies, spice and wheat.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
232,"2016-09-10",4.0,"Can courtesy of Ibrew2or3. Cheers, Dave! Pours a clear yellow with a white head. Nose is big cucumber and coconut with mild floral and slight bitterness. Flavor is big coconut and cucumber with light floral. Light to medium in body and delightful overall.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
232,"2016-08-19",3.1,"On tap at Hop Devine. It pours a clear light golden color with a white head. The aroma has nice pale malitness, hints of corn, mint and cucumber. The flavor is very strong with the cucumber and lighter notes of pale malt and a little hop spice in the finish. Light bodied. The cucumber was a bit overdone... in fact a LOT overdone on this one. Not offensive though. Decent drinking.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
232,"2016-08-18",3.8,"16 ounce Can from Daneys in Monterey, CA for $3.25. Cream soda colored pour. Nose is fresh cut cucumber, maybe a little lemon and noble hops. Flavor is cucumber, noble hops, bread like malt, and light coconut. Finish is slightly bitter, but a slight fruitiness also lingers on the tongue. This is a well put together beer with quality ingredients.","California, USA","MattH"
232,"2016-08-05",3.6,"16 oz can, purchased at Special Brews. So intrigued by this beer. Its like there was no way this beer wuldnt be refreshing, even though its a High Water beer, in a 16 oz can that looks like a homebrew label, and its a beer that sounds like a homebrew idea. Who cares. Its good. I didnt pour this. Instead, I enjoyed it from the can, while pretending to know how to work on my car. If the gas gauge says empty, I know how to fix it, but the line sorta gets drawn there. Fruity aroma. Flavor is exremedy refreshing, though a bit of a watered down feel. The kind of beer I would want to take with me on a hiking trip through the illustration on the can. Tasty stuff here. Another positive cucumber beer story.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
232,"2016-06-28",3.3,"Pours a finger of head on a clear straw body.
Aroma is mild cucumber and dry grain.
Taste is mildly sweet overall. A nice drink for a hot day.
The texture is crisp.","Corbett, Oregon, USA","Fatehunter"
232,"2016-06-26",3.4,"On tap @ Taps Barrel House. Slightly hazed golden beer with a short lived white head. Tons of cucumber both on the aroma and flavor. Theres some sweet biscuit malt, cracker, and coconut. Light bitterness of floral and earthy hops. Finishes a bit husky and grainy. Pretty sweet overall. Its an interesting beer, but a small pour is fine, I think.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
232,"2016-06-20",3.7,"16 oz can from Total Wine. Pours yellow gold with q transient white head and an herbal aroma. There is a refreshing pale malt flavor with a lot of cucumber and a hint of coconut. Very refreshing.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
232,"2016-06-20",3.7,"Can shared by Marcus. Pours gold with a transient white head. Aroma of cucumber and something spicy. Med body almost. Flavor is cucumber, spicy hop, and maybe a coconut hint maybe not.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
232,"2016-06-17",3.8,"Pours clear gold, low white head. I do get the cucumber in the aroma, earthiness too. Much sweeter than expected in the tongue.....celery, radish, cucumber.... Smooth and refreshing.","Katy, Texas, USA","Andrew196"
232,"2016-06-04",3.5,"Quite refreshing - nose of sweet malt, cucumber and light noble hops. Body is light and crisp. Flavor is cucumber essence, grainy malt, and a splash of coconut. Great w BBQ.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
