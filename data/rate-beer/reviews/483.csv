483,"2011-08-21",4.4,"Pours black with medium beige head.

Aroma is moderately roasty with a bit of chocolate and coffee qualities coming through.  Much the same in the flavors, with a bit of earthy and floral hop characters.  Maybe dial back the bittering IBUs a few points, but not bad.

Mouthfeel is a little creamy and not overpowered by the roastiness.  Overall, a very nice American stout.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","RateandPillage"
483,"2011-08-02",3.9,"First foray with the new atlanta brew pub and a heck of an experience it was. Solid line up of beers to appeal to a wide variety of tastes and the couple I had were well made and unique enough to keep you entertained. This stout here is no slouch. Nice black pour with a bit of a tan head to add some creaminess. A nice amount of roasty chocolate malt and a pleasant bitterness on the back end. A little sticky sweet that lasts with you for some time. Easily drinkable. Easily accessible. This place is going to do well.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
483,"2011-07-31",5.0,"Comes out of the tap an opaque warm sable with a fine-bubbled tan head that leave some substantial lacing. Smoky, chocolaty aroma has a tone of quality coffee and hints of caramel and licorice. Rich flavor has tones of unsweet chocolate, premium roast coffee and caramel, along with hints of licorice, toffee and molasses and just a whisper of hops. Fizzy, lively texture leaves a nice smoky tingle. If you live in Atlanta, or if ever you visit, this one is a must!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"

483,"2011-06-26",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2011 16 ounce pint - $5.50 at the Wrecking Bar Brewpub in Atlanta, Georgia.

Appearance: Delivered to my corner seat at the bar a near-black body with a bubbly, blotched head displaying a medium sandy-toned hue. Very thin smattering of lace on the way down.

Smell: Noted notes of chocolate and toasted loaf bread, a splash of chilled coffee, a singular drop of vanilla, and a very minute background hint of fruity citrus.

Taste: Sweet-tasting chocolate mixed with sugar-sweetened coffee and layered over lightly toasted bread. Faint hint of licorice. Some dark fruitiness lingering within. Modestly bitter, with the hops yielding a bit of candied lemon. Drying and with a bit more citrus and chocolate on the smooth finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Its good, its tasty, and plenty flavorful without needing to stoop to the tawdry lows of cheap tricks and base gimmickry.

Update (7/26/11): Seems the second batch has upped the citrus character and hop bitterness, which I didnt care for as much.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
