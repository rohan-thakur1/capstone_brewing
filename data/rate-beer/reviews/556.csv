556,"2011-03-07",4.0,"A: Pours essentially black, maybe some reddish-brown highlights to it.  A small tan head sits on top.

S: Intense is a great way to describe this beer.  Really strong on the dark fruits up front, particularly plums, with a nice black cherry note to it as well.  The bourbon follows offering a pleasant booziness in addition to oak and vanilla aromas.  Just a touch of roasted malt (or perhaps charred oak) is in there.

T: Sweet malt, sugar, and dark fruits are there to remind you that this is a Belgian beer.  The plums are again quite strong and there is a touch of banana and raisin.  Bourbon barrel really provides a lot of the flavor and gives the beer a solid oak, vanilla, and booze profile.

M: Medium to full in body with a moderate carbonation.

556,"2011-02-16",4.1,"At tap at the Bells Fermented Eclipse event at Stub and Herbs back in June. Fantastic event.

Pours near black with a nice tan head and a bit of lacing. Not too bad considering the heft on this. Nose is loaded with dark fruits, cherries, molasses, bourbon, and some fruity esters. Hints of roast going forward as well. The bourbon takes over the taste a bit and isnt as integrated as the nose, but still is quite good. Mouthfeel is full and fairly heavy, although not overly boozy. Drinks very well, and was one of my favorites of the event. Would like to try this again.

556,"2010-09-30",4.0,"Total blackness in the glass, nice brown ring above, slowly slipping down in size.
Aroma reeks of bourbon, Big molasses and vanilla, sweet, rich, and decadent. Cocoa and dark fruit below, a bit.
Taste: Succulent and sweet, juicy, palpably pulpy, rolls away and dries off some. Dark fruit, fig, raisin, dates, maybe...a wonderful port wine quality asserts itself. Realigns, edges into moderation, evens out, ends light and dry on the palate. Flavor still lingers lightly.
If theres a flaw in this, its that you cant really discern the character of the dubbel beneath the bourbon in this, but its too excellent a combination to quibble over such things. If you love bourbon barrel brews, this one does the trick. The base beer holds its own, and the bourbon truly shines.

Moderate to heavy malty, woody, bourbon, yeast aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy bourbon sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to long duration. Standout brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
556,"2010-06-15",4.2,"Draft at the Brickstore. I love you guys. At first it was served a bit too cold and the bourbon was a little off putting. As it warmed though it was liquid goodness. An incredible vanilla flavor with a touch of bourbon alcohol up front. That fades into a malty nutty rich mouth coating experience. The finish leaves you with a slight sweetness and touch of fruit. Complex where each sip gives you a different element. Really nice drink here.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
556,"2010-06-14",4.1,"draft at City Tap House for their ""Bells 31 Flavors"" event.
Poured a very dark brown with caramel-colored edges and a mocha two-finger head which dissapated quickly to a frothy coating. Nose is Dark fruits, Belgian yeast and sweet malt. The taste is roasted malt up front followed by dark fruits, vanilla and the brown, sugar-like sweet malt. There is also evidence of the yeast and some spice. Mouthfeel is medium, smooth - not a lot of carbonation evident, and very dry. This is a nice, comfortable brew and I liked the level of warmth and influence of the bourbon barrel. A good sipper for sure but the dryness might not argue for making it session-able for me.","Havertown, Pennsylvania, USA","regspeir"
556,"2010-06-08",5.0,"This beer almost had the texture of liquid molasses, that may not sound appealing but it was amazing.  Its aged for months in bourbon barrels which brings out the strong vanilla and coconut flavors.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","delirium11"
556,"2010-06-07",4.5,"Served on draft at Jose Pistolas.

Pours pitch black and completely opaque with a massive three finger dark mocha head that slowly fades into a lasting cap. Minimal spots of lacing left behind.

Sweet malty aroma with a huge bourbon character in the nose. Slight earthy oak and vanilla from the barrel aging complimen the bourbon and dark malt notes. Hints of dark fruit and subtle spice. Picking up tart dark cherry, fig and plum. So far this beer looks and smells amazing.

Incredibly smooth drinking with the perfect amount of sweet bourbon and heat balancing out the dark raster malt notes and sweet tart dark fruit. Chewy and slightly viscous with zesty peppery spice and alcohol heat. As in he aroma, the barrel aging adds complexity giving off hi ts of vanilla and earthy oak. This beer is incredibly complex and even though the bourbon gives off some heat and warmth in the finish, the ABV is decently masked, making this dangerously drnkable. Highly recommnded!!!!","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

556,"2010-04-07",3.5,"On tap at Crunchys, East Lansing. Deep, murky brown body, tight tan head. Nose of potent bourbon and buttery oak with chocolate, plum, pear and a hint of pickle. Bourbon-dominated body, hot, with vanilla and tannic oak in addition to chocolate, prune, licorice, and spices from the base beer. The barrel aging shifted the emphasis of this beer to the bourbon and oak, with mixed results; some of the subtleties of the beer were lost to the tannic booziness.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

Aroma of bourbon, coconut, chocolate, a hint of toasted dark malt, candi sugar and some dry raisin. Taste is medium bodied with the bourbon over-powering the Belgian dubbel character. Finish is a touch rough and the bourbonization may be overpowering. At least it will make the bourbon fans happy.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"

556,"2010-02-12",3.8,"Growler from miketd

I believe mike shared this in lieu of his presence at the start of a winter tasting.  The bourbon was a bit much for my tastes making me think this one needs time to settle (if that is possible).  If you like bourbon bombs hunt it down.  Otherwise you will still find a solid release that enhances an already amazing beer but it wont be like some of the other Bells barrel aged releases.

Aroma / Appearance - The body looks like Hell Hath No Fury except maybe a bit more sluggish and flat.  Whether this was due to the age of the growler or the beer itself is hard to say.  It definitely is different in appearance than an imperial stout (more brownish) but still murky and dark.  The nose was a little too rich in bourbon for my tastes.  I would have liked it toned down and this would have instantly been my favorite beer of the night.  As it is I would love to give this another try at the Beer Engine or somewhere else for a special event.

Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel was thick and chewy.  For the profile of the base beer see my other rating.  This one adds a heavy bourbon aspect that borders on cloying.  A growler alone would be a tough challenge.  I think in the end this is a beer that is well made but suffers a little from the ""everything barrel aged"" approach that has been making the rounds for the last few years.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
556,"2010-02-06",3.0,"Growler shared by George.  Thanks George!  Pours black/dark brown with tan head.  Aroma is dark fruit, nail polish, vanilla, booze, and yeast.   The aroma is really hard to take.  It simply doesnt smell that good.  Medium mouthfeel.  Flavor follows the nose and is a bit better.  In other words, it tastes better than it smells.  Hard liquor upfront with vanilla, yeast, dark fruit, and nail polish meld together.  I think the barrel used must have been a sour mash whiskey because thats what it tastes like.  Just a little too boozy for me overall and I really like the boozy ones.  Just not this one.  Its average.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","fiver29"

Nose is vanilla and bourbon with some chocolate and fruit. Bourbon and vanilla hit the tongue first with the chocolate creeping in on the back end. The Belgian aspects of this beer are kinda getting masked by the barrel-aging and I couldnt be happier. Tasty stuff!","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"

The aroma picked up sour apricot and other fruity notes over some darker herbal and odd yeasty character.. bourbon and toasted oak accents.. interesting, but just OK.  The flavor was tangy with the expected sourness from the nose (but sporting more pear than apricot).. bourbon was light overall, but building and spicy.. darker Belgian-inspired yeast in there too.. nice hit of chocolate on the back.  Medium-plus bodied with a creamy middle, but too much sourness and astringency.. this either didnt take well to the barrel or it needs more aging time outside the barrel.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
