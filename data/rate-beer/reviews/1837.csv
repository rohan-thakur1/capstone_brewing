1837,"2017-05-19",4.0,"Bottle from Rizmajer bar, Budapest. Hazy copper bronze off white suds. Toffee, caramel, metallic aroma. Filling big body, sticky caramel malt with balanced bitterness. Sweet and dry, big but balanced. Ive been trying to get my hands on this one for sometime and it was worth the wait.","Budapest, HUNGARY","Cristobal37"
1837,"2017-05-11",3.4,"On tap @ Rizmajer Sorhaz. Deep golden with white head. Its a medium to heavy bodied, malts based beer with no strong aroma and long sweetish finish. Not a supercomplex beer, but its a quite well made one.","Balassagyarmat, HUNGARY","midovark"
1837,"2015-05-20",4.2,"500ml bottle. It is actually my favourite beer this time. It has long lasting rock foam. The bock is sweet smelling, very sticky bodied nice beer. Aroma is quite simple, sweetness and nice bitter hop, not grassy, not citric, not earthy just good. Light purple coloured and unfiltered.","Szeged, HUNGARY","dr.dod"

1837,"2013-11-05",3.4,"(Bottle from Csak a Jó Sör, Budapest)
Refreshing, slightly grassy hop aroma with light toasty-malt feel. (6+) 
A mid-orange-brown beer with beige head. (3+) 
Great mix of really grainy malts and hops. Hints of honey bot not at
all too sweet. Clearly tastes of what beer should have in it. Nice
Old World hop finish.
Unusually, Phil did not share this.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

1837,"2013-06-25",4.1,"0.5l bottle. Beautiful hazy orange body, off-white head. Aroma of caramel, ripe orange, honey and grassy hops. Taste of caramel, peach, toast, honey and grassy hops. Very well balanced betweent the sweet malts and the hop bitterness, the finish is more towards the hops. Awesome beer.","Budapest, HUNGARY","kapusil"
1837,"2013-06-11",4.2,"gyönyörű borostyánszín megjelenése magában is elvarázsolja az embert és mindezt a mézes, sűrűn malátás, gyümölcsös illat és íz csak tovább fokozza megspékelve némi komlós keserűsséggel. Csak gratulálni lehet hozzá.","","zenonn"
1837,"2013-06-05",3.7,"Mély, borostyán sárga színe van, ami belül enyhén opálos. Habja világos bézs színű, jó kötésű, kemény, tekintélyes nagyságú és kitartású. Illata malátás, mézes, aszalt fügés és barackos, édeskés és kellemesen komlós. Ízében is ott a méz, méghozzá karamellizálva, derék adag maláta, egy kis aszalt gyümölcs. Egy ilyen édeskés kezdés után aztán csatlakozik ehhez a társasághoz egy derekas adag zafír komló, aminek a keserűje és finom aromája szépen kiegyensúlyozza, felturbózza az ízélményt. Elég testes, de nem nehéz, közepesen élénk. Utóíze keserédes, kissé száraz, gyümölcsös és hosszan tart. Remek kis május köszöntő itóka ez! Ne igyuk túlhűtve és lassan kortyolgassuk.","Budapest, HUNGARY","ogreface"
1837,"2013-06-02",3.8,"0.5l bottle from Rizmajer Sörház. Hazy dark orange color, bit of red. Aroma is fruity, bit of citrus. Foam is thick, tastes bittersweet, maybe honey. Lasts relatively long and leaves some proper laces. Taste is dominated by malty and fruity (banana, citrus) sweetness,  Also some honey. Compensated by mild bitterness, mostly in the aftertaste. Very harmonic. In the end the lacing is gone and the taste becomes a bit sirupy, bit overall this is a well-done Bavarian Bock. The best from the brewery so far.","HUNGARY","promontor"
1837,"2013-05-28",3.9,"Gyönyörű Maibock, csodás (aroma)komlózással, mézesen édeskés, telt malátás testtel, lenyűgöző opálos narancsszínnel és - bock ellenére - igencsak tartós, szép habbal. Remek sör.","HUNGARY","pif"
