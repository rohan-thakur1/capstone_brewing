3413,"2017-03-11",4.6,"The Six (and last before the big one) Beer of my #6000 celebration (#6 of 13 - six beers on either side of 6000 and the milestone itself). Crisp deep amber and brown coloured body with a fast-dying tan head, that starts at three centimetres and fades to just about nothing. Aroma of sour grapes, raspberries, strawberries, oak, dry malt, lemons, yeast, cedar, brett and a ton of more sour cherry flavours - super pungent and very nice, definitely mouthwatering! Light to Medium-bodied; Assertive dry oaky cherry flavours at first with a definite sour quality, but a ton of complexity with oak, cedar, grain, alcohol, raspberry, lemon and grapes coming through as well, ending with yeast, strawberries, old wood and a healthy dose of cherries - very nice and robust throughout. Aftertaste is quite pungent with the cherry sour flavours dominating, but other fruit flavours, some lemons, hints of dry oak, cedar and more yeast is very noticeable, but a mouthwatering finish makes you wish for the next sip after just a few seconds. Overall, a great beer that makes you feel like you are in Flanders, but shows so much complexity and depth that any price you paid for the bottle, is probably worthwhile, given the effort, ingredients and care that went into this one. Definitely worth trying if you can find it, and perhaps even better to take some space in your place to cellar it for a while to let the flavours develop a touch and then mellow out.

3413,"2016-08-20",4.0,"Pours a dark mahogany with an off-white creamy head. The nose feels authentically Flemish, hitting the expected oaky vanilla and sour cherry notes synonymous with this style. Smells like a musty attic, but filled with brown sugar, dried apricot, red apple, and grape candy. It first hits the tongue with sharp, dry oak that overwhelms the otherwise refreshing and juicy flavor. Again, Oude Tart seems to come straight out of the Rodenbach playbook. With warmth it develops a chewy, cherry-filled character. Blackberries, leather, a hint of iron. Ends on a sticky oaky note that could have used more subtlety. Difficult to criticize such a spot-on effort but its over-oaked quality holds it back from joining the ranks of La Folie which remains my favorite of the American takes on this style.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

3413,"2015-08-01",3.9,"Classic Bruery beer, an oud bruin aged on oak barrels, in the style of western Flemish Vlaams rood. Light gushing, but only a loose, unstable head remained, light beige in colour and reduced to islands of foam after a while; colour of the beer is a misty, translucid chestnut brown with reddish bronze hue. Complex aroma in which the wood (old furniture) hits the nose first, after which a whole array of impressions follows: brambleberries, blueberries, passionfruit, raisins, unsweetened yoghurt, leather, wine vinegar, caramel, sour apple, sherry, blue cheese, red wine, vanilla... Taste is fruit sour in onset, redcurrant, blueberries, passionfruit, green apple peel, soft carbonation, drying acidity - a bit sharp on the green apple acid or even vinegar acid at first, relieved by a more sedate lactic tartness spread over a smooth caramelly backbone which comes across as a bit less bready than in original Flemish red beers like Rodenbach, but still very pleasant, with a vinous mouthfeel; complex and quenching finish of strong oaky woodiness but low vanilla-like tannins, lingering drying fruit tartness, a bit sharp still, juicy malts and a faraway reminder of a deep, leafy, earthy hop bitterishness, noticeable for only a brief moment (whereas in fact it should have stayed hidden completely). Interesting beer with a label that appeals to Dutch language speakers (oude taart being a derogatory name for an old lady); the word verzuur particularly struck me and my fellow taster as a weird corruption of Dutch language. Complex and woody, but maybe a bit too sharply acidic for an oud bruin; still, for me personally, this is the closest American attempt so far at rivalling the greatness of the Flemish red tradition.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

3413,"2015-07-30",4.1,"I am so excited to pull this out of the cooler tonight. I love this style, but have never had the opportunity to taste this particular beer. I pull out my favorite tulip glass and crack the cap. The aroma leaps from the neck, its rich bite on my sinuses taking me aback; the deep, sour fruits already leaving me a bit tongue-tied. I pour a few inches of rich fluid; a subtle, golden foam rises with the mahogany cascade; large flecks of sediment finding their way through the brew and its soft head, some to settle on the bottom, some to be enjoyed by the drinker. Me. The head dies back quickly, leaving the defenseless brew naked to my eager advances. -- 
The aroma is earthy, but sharp, and teeming with over-ripe cherries. It overwhelms my olfactory senses, and my aching, needy taste buds are flooded with moisture in anticipation of the first draw. -- I pull greedily at the sour beer, filling my mouth with the stuff, using it to saturate every exposed surface for the experience. The flavor is the aroma, a replica intensified ten times over, and flush with complexity. The sour has an added accent of vanilla in certain mouthfuls, and is teasing only the tip of my tongue now, although it began by abusing my entire mouth. I suppose that by the end of this glass, it will be a glorious beverage still, but with much less punch than at the beginning.
The finish is dry, rounded and though so many sours will leave you with too much funk for way too long, this one is fairly clean in a few minutes. The medium body is buoyed comfortably by the perfect carbonation, and one that lasts as long as that Casanova you knew in college, but didnt want to take home to your dad.
The beer is fantastic. I dont even think I can close with anything but ""I want more"".","USA","lightbias"

I sincerely enjoyed this beer but I wish they would sell it in mini-bottles. I wouldnt buy a bomber again unless it was for a much larger party. This has a very sour wine-like (not spoiled) quality about it.","","teromous"

3413,"2014-08-18",3.4,"My Bottom Line:
Cherry-flavored caramel meld into delicate balsamic acidity in this otherwise musty Flanders Red interpretation.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam surrounds the muddy pale brown.
-Earthiness is also found in the finish.
-The caramelized fruitiness tends to take away from my enjoyment of this brew.
-The flavor profile is certainly pleasant, but it is not entirely successful to me.

3413,"2014-07-11",2.5,"Visual: Pours dark cherry red with a smallish dissipating creamy head, thin ringed retention, micro bubbles, several steady streams.

Summary: The intense sour tartness is very taxing on the palate. The first glass is tough to sip, moreso as it warms up. The fruit flavour is okay, but Im not too fond of the pukey flavour that creeps up near the finish. I prefer the Duchess de Bourgogne; its much more palatable.","","sulawang"

3413,"2014-01-25",3.0,"Reviewed from notes. She pours a mostly dark brown and leaves the same colored body with less than a fingers worth of slightly foamy head that dies within a minute, some slightly clingy lacing mainly slides into the body. The smell has tart cherries up front, slight hints of oakiness. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma adds a fairly extreme sour element invading my taste buds. There is a tart cherry aftertaste, and somewhat of a dry finish. 
On the palate, she sits about a medium, and comes across fairly sessionable - perhaps. Carbonation pounds my mouth and tongue, but honestly Im not sure how this compares to others of its style, good I guess.
Overall, I know this is my first Flanders Red ale for review on here, so uh... sure, Ill say good for the style but for me, its extremely tart and sour, Ill have to look into more of this style to see how they compare if I seek any more at all.

It's hard to taste past the lemony sourness, but I get a touch of Brett, and grape.

Fruity notes seem to jump out at random points, leading to an incoherent flavor profile.  Slightly medicinal with an unrefined overall structure.

Ive given Oude Tart a number of chances from various bottled batches, and having it on tap again at Blind Tiger the other day confirms: Im not a fan of this beer.

This is a very tough style to nail -- even moreso than fruit lambics IMO. Oude Tart is a great example of a brewery with a well-regarded sour program struggling with the Oude Bruin style.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"
3413,"2012-11-27",4.0,"A very nice blood red color with a moderate, creamy, khaki head which is somewhat lasting and leaves some frothy lace; much better head than most Flemishs.  The nose is nice with worn leather, some balsamic, figs, Craisins, certainly toasty oak and caramel, subtle spice, and hints at some sweet basil.  The flavor is more tart than the nose led on with Craisins and tart bing cherries, still a balsamic note, very slight sour funk, dry and toast oak, and a more than moderate acidity.  The palate is somewhat puckering with a quenching acidity, light to medium, and lively.  Not overly complex, overly acidic, overly sweet, overly funky, or overly oaky, but very well balanced between all aspects.

A - Pours a still and murky dark/brown red body. A thin tan cap of foam forms but disappears quickly leaving behind absolutely nothing. Lacing is non-existent.

T - Super tart and sour. Mouth puckering cherries and red grapes. The end is vinegar and vanilla rich oak. The finish is quick with just some barrel tannins left in the aftertaste. Quite tasty with a lot of bright and vibrant fruit notes.

Ive been wanting to try this beer for a while. I was pretty excited that it showed up at this tasting. Oude Tart appears a brown shade with an average sized head and adequate lacing. The beer has a very pleasant aroma with scents of brettanomyces and a hint of sweetness. This is a very tasty beer, no doubt. There is a slight vinegar edge to the finish that I find to be a tad harsh, though not totally distracting by any means.

Pour is wildly divergent: mine is dark brown, my wifes is dark red, from different levels of the bottle. Nose is big oak, raspberries, cherries, tart. Nice start. 

Oude Tart cuts through the barrels like a German tank division through Polish cavalry. Huge oak notes trade light chatter with the searing tartness that lines the brew. Drought-dry. Fruit so present in the nose is tame to the point of absence. Earthy, slight vinegar, green apple, a bit leathery. Sippable.

3413,"2011-12-18",3.3,"b>In short: A Flemish Sour style ale with a focus on red-wine barrels and vinegar.  Decent sipper, below average for the style.
How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed when approximately 1 year of age.  Bottle sent to me by kegbear, thanks a lot Craig
The look: Cloudy ruby-copper body topped by a medium beige head that quickly recedes to a ring of foam
In long: Nose is very tannic, red-wine barrels, cherry skin, a bit musty, light port wine notes.  Basically it does smell like a classic Flemish Sour but with a focus on the oak/red-wine barrels.  Taste follows through.  A lot of oak, a lot of tannins, vinegar, berries, cherry skin, raspberry seeds, grains, lots of lacto and all that tied together by a nice caramel.  Sour level is pretty high.  The beer is unfortunately too much vinegary to be considered an good example of the style, Im talking pure acetic acid here.  I found that drinking a full 750ml to be a challenge, by the end I was really looking forward to opening something totally different.  Intense it is, easy to drink it is not.  The fruity version (Bruery Sour Cherry Oude Tart) was a lot better despite its lack of carbonation.   Anyway, to me this is just another example that any vinegary American Sour Ale gets good ratings.

3413,"2011-03-18",3.8,"A steady pour into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces a three-finger thick, pale brown tinged, dark tan colored head.  The beer is a concentrated, dark brown-amber color that shows a hazed, cranberry red hue when held up to the light.  The aroma is huge with a bright, tart, super fruity, berry like character that is backed by a touch of nutty oxidation like character.  The tartness is all lactic at first, but once I start to dig around there is a hint of acetic acid spiciness that also boosts a touch of vinegar (not quite as rich as balsamic, but certainly fruit leaning) character in the finish.  The finish has a dry, cracker like grain character as well as a toasted whole grain note that adds a wholesome bread like character to the nose.  Other than the tartness, this beer is relatively clean; meaning it isnt overly funky, which is certainly in line with a traditional Flemish inspired beer (at least modern examples of such).  The malt, oxidation and tartness all combine to provide a character that I want to describe as earthy for some reason.  As the beer warms some acetone like character starts to become noticeable in the finish.

This still has quite the spritzy carbonation despite sitting in my glass for the last 10 minutes; it foams up a fair amount as it rolls across the tongue, which counteracts the viscous character from the oak and lactic acid contribution that provides this beer a definite texture.  The dominant lactic tartness throughout is again anchored by a hint of acetic acidity in the finish that is fairly light and at just about the perfect amount (it is far less than that found in Rodenbach Grand Cru).  There is a toasted oak character that provides a woodiness as well as some tannic astringency towards the finish.  The red wine barrels come through quite well here, not just with the oak, but also with a deep, supporting fruitiness that provides a definite berry character that is understated but powerful in some way.  The toasted oak character mixes with a solid toasted malt character that tastes of brown, whole grain bread and whole grain cracker notes that seem caramelized, but without any real sweetness (if that makes any sense).  This beer tastes quite dry to me, but I have a feeling that is because I had a chocolate chip cookie a half hour ago.  The whole grain / dry-caramelized malt character starts to come out more as the beer warms up.  

My second pour of this sees me noticing the fruitiness quite a bit more again, b/c it is still cool and there is also a hint of sweetness to this brew that my palate is finally able to detect; flavors of strawberry (accentuated by the touch of acetic acid noticeable here) as well as the red-wine notes are noticeable.  When the beer is cooler the astringent oak character is a bit more noticeable, it really softens up quite a bit as it warms.  Actually the red wine character is quite a bit more noticeable when the beer is on the cool side too; really the maltiness comes out quite a bit more as the beer warms up and helps to soften up the other notes (which isnt necessarily a good thing, depending on what your preference is).

Tasty enough, though I wouldnt mind a touch more funkiness from something like Brettanomyces, but that would certainly put this outside the modern interpretation of a Flemish sour.  I definitely like the body of this brew, it has some texture to it, but it is still fairly quaffable and the zippy carbonation helps to lighten things up enough.  I feel like I shouldnt like this as much as I am as it seems to be lacking in complexity, but damn, I am enjoying this quite a bit.  The flavors are so well integrated and the oak / wine notes are at such a soft, integrated level that just makes this beer work quite well.  Really it is the oak / wine notes that make this beer in the end, without them this beer would really need something or it wouldnt be nearly as tasty as it is.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3413,"2010-04-16",3.8,"Bottle from my main man Jon and served in a Corsendonk glass: Deep ruby and mahogany hue with a lasting fizzy and frothy slightly off-white head with nice lace. The aroma is wild yeast vinegar and damp basement vapours, tart cherry and peaches, floral and dusty esters with a moderate french oak note. The taste is surprisingly not as tart or funky as the nose let on. Moderate fruity acidity, wheat husks, biscuity and caramel malt, well balanced but missing the knockout punch I thought would be here. The fruit character seems more pitty and aspirin like on the tannic oak finish. Some brett and cheesy tones are hidden but hint of their presence. The mouth feel is quite lively and moderately refreshing but does seem to medicinal and tannic at this moment. Perhaps time will smooth this out and also allow for new characteristics to come into play. For now it is a good but not earth shattering brew.

3413,"2010-03-05",4.2,"This one becomes increasingly murky with each pour, with a reddish brown body and a big clumpy beige head that recedes slowly with small foam spots on the top and some lacing on the sides.

The aroma is brown sugar, tart cherries and hints of funky brett.  On top of this is the wood character, definitely some oak.

The taste is more of the tart cherries, seemingly sweeter than the aroma would indicate and, though the brett is present, the finish is sweeter than I was expecting.  Its dry, just not as dry as others Ive tried.

The mouthfeel is extremely clean and crisp with a pleasant tartness and light funk in the finish.

I think this is an excellent Flanders as its plenty sweet with the cherries with enough brett to balance it, but not so much as to dominate.  Excellent.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

M: The body is medium with a very effervescent feel on the tongue.

D: A very nice example of a Flanders red/brown ale. Some people compared it to Rodenbach Grand Cru, but I found it to be a little less oaky and vinous, and a bit more drinkable. I plan to drink these bottles fairly soon as they taste wonderful now.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

3413,"2010-02-18",3.5,"750mL bottle. Pours a very hazy, dark, murky brownish-plum color; light-tan head with medium bubbles, decent retention, and solid lacing; theres an oily yellowish color at the edges of the liquid; slightly muddled presentation. Lightly tart aroma of red fruits (cherries, strawberries, especially), hints of a toasted barrel character, and a vinous, zinfandel / jammy presence that, in my opinion, not only shows the wine barrel character prominently, but also seems to be going down that difficult road approaching a band-aid / medicinal / antiseptic character that occurs so frustratingly often in these wine-barrel-aged beers; its not there yet, but this doesnt strike me at all as something to keep in ones cellar; jammy, plummy, lightly tannic. Medium body: lively carbonation, tempered by a medium presence of tannins and rich red fruits; lots of red wine character (berries, jam) upfront, very moderately tart (nothing overtly sour about this), with touches of lively acidity and seemingly lactic citrus notes; as in the appearance, this is certainly muddled, messy, and (while pleasant enough) almost destined to head downhill quickly; call it a hunch. This reminds me a lot of some of Averys barrel-aged sour experiments: lightly medicinal, moderate tannins, scattered way of doing things. Medium finish of red fruits, light toastiness, soft tannins.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

3413,"2010-02-11",4.0,"Courtesy TheCheeseman, direct from Patrick Rue himself.  A cloudy, ruddy, reddish-brown to sienna colored body is crowned with a small, foamy, tan head.  Settling down to a chunky film with a  thin edge, the foam leaves some nice, diagonal flares of lacing on the glass.  The nose is enticingly fruity and juicy, showing notes of jammy strawberry, sweet-tart cherry, and just a hint of fig, all wrapped in a shroud of mild, softly soured and buggy oak.  The balance between fresh, fruity-tart juice and the woody barrel is incredible.  Flavors show a bit more sourness, with some citric acidity emerging, but again remain deliciously balanced.  Hints of green apple join the sweet-tart cherry-berry fun. Certainly young right now, I think some more acetic character could develop with time.  The palate is medium bodied, crisp, and refreshing, with a little residual sugar slickness and a soft, lively carbonation. Very good brew.  If I had access, Id buy a case.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

I get just a tiny hint of acetone.  Moderate sour acidity in the flavor with most of the aforementioned aromas in pretty much the same quantities.  My gf thought this was as sour as the Cantillon St. Lamvinus we had, but I disagree.  I feel this has a pretty big malt backbone that keeps the sourness at bay, peaking at a 4, with earthy bitterness at a 3.  Moderate carbonation with a medium body.

Pours with a tan head that sticks for a while over a beautiful deep brown to red body. Aroma of red wine, light acetic acid, beautiful sourness and some perfumey floral notes.

Good tartness, with some nice wine barrel backing. Medium effervescence. I really cant help thinking to my self that this is La Folie: Light version (I am speaking about a decently aged 750ml, not the new 22oz, which this blows away). This beer is still young, and I can see it reaching that level of amazingness in a year or so. In short, probably the second best American made Flemish Red ever made (behind the old La Folies...absolutely blows the new La Folies and Dissident, et al, out of the water).
