3000,"2014-09-11",2.2,"Watery yellow with a disappearing white head. Sweet grain aroma. I was a bit surprised by how inoffensive it is, actually. Tastes sweet, cereal grain, and a bit of booze in the back end. Overall, very sweet. Finish is round and slightly hot. Full, smooth body. I wouldnt drink this again, however I have had much worse malt liquors. This one gets the job done without being fiery or taste of garbage truck juice. I guess that makes for a win.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"

3000,"2007-07-28",2.8,"I think Kalyani may be the best beer label in India.  Even the strong seems more like a beer despite the Malt Liquor designation.  Very nice color and tone, certainly not quite international standards yet, but its better than most!","USA","javatestcase"
