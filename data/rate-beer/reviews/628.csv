628,"2017-02-23",4.0,"22 oz bottle, dated 1/13/17. Pours dark brown with a medium creamy tan head that retains well and laces the glass.

The aroma is sweet lactose and chocolate malt with a lot of roast coffee.

The flavor is sweet lactose and chocolate malt with a big roast coffee finish. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with smooth carbonation.

Overall, a nice coffee stout. I think Id prefer it without lactose.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"
628,"2017-02-18",4.5,"Black pour with a thin tan foamy head. Big earthy cocoa and espresso nose with a Italian creamy undertone that makes the whole brew smell amazingly like tiramisu. Full and clean flavor that features lots of earthy cocoa and earthy coffee toasty tones with a sweet finish of cream and subtle chocolate cake and a whisper of creamy coffee. A tad earthy and bitter with cocoa bittersweetness and slightly acrid coffee but is overall damn good.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

628,"2017-01-29",3.4,"Bomber. Strong coffee aroma with notes of chocolate, roasted malt and milk sugar. Pours deep brown with about one finger of mocha brown head that has excellent retention and good lacing. Starts with rich roasted malt as well as chocolate and milk sugar sweetness to go along with the full body and creamy mouthfeel. Finishes smooth and a bit dry with a lot of roast coffee flavor that lingers in the palate after each sip. Pretty nice, but has quite a bit of coffee for my liking.","","zoucrew102"

628,"2015-05-14",3.6,"Bottle. Dark chocolate-brown, thick and opaque. An inch of cocoa powder-colored froth recedes slowly. The nose: tangy, oily coffee, bitter toast, some sweet caramel and milk. The flavor is equally coffee-forward, delivering biting dark roast. Soft caramel smooths things out and anise spices up the finish. Hefty medium body, like coffee with lots of cream. Mild prickly carbonation. Decent.","","PartyFowle"

628,"2015-01-21",3.4,"bottle on a lazy snowy afternoon. dark brown body with a grey head. yep, there is coffee in this. smelled while cracking the cap. aroma is mainly coffee with a mild smoke and a good bit of marshmallow sweetness. bitter coffee taste hits first, gives way to a latte like sweetness and a milky finish. developes into a nice iced coffee flavor as it warms.would personally like a bit more sweetness and a more subdued bitter roast, but it is a nice beer that i will likely buy again now that i know it. more of an easy sipper after work than a midday respite.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
