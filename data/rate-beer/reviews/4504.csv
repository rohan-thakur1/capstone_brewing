4504,"2017-06-21",3.5,"Pours dark amber from the bottle and leaves a thin, creamy head that lingers. Aroma is strongly of caramel, with hints of turpentine. Taste is sweet with strong notes of butterscotch in the finish. Thick, sticky, very warming, but the ABV remains largely hidden. Overall, not bad. Would have no doubt been more agreeable on a cooler day.","Butzbach, Hesse, GERMANY","hauxe"

4504,"2017-05-08",2.7,"Die Idee mag zwar hervorragend sein, aber die Umsetzung erinnert mich stark an ein billiges polnisches Imperial Pils. Ordentlich Sirup mit einer gewissen Portion an Lakritze und derber Süße gemeinsam mit einem erstaunlich bitteren Abgang stellen hier nicht wirklich ein rundes Bild dar. Zu unausgewogen.","Wanne-Eickel, GERMANY","MichaelAwesome"
4504,"2017-04-28",3.6,"0.33 cl bottle. Pours a dark hazy amber with a lot of tan foam. Aroma of yeast with grassy tones mixed in. The taste is malty with toffee and hints of peach but only a subtle amount of alcohol that really comes through. Decently tart in the finish.","Hamburg, GERMANY","jkbier"

4504,"2017-04-17",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2017 Bottle. Orange-copper colored with a small creamy head. Fruity notes of plum, grapes, peach and a sherry/brandy note, with spices and vanilla. Malty notes as well, biscuits and caramel. Medium sweet taste with a light balancing bitter finish. Quite pleasent. Full thick body, low carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel. Complex flavor with a wide array of distinctive fruity and malty notes, plum, grapes, peach, sherry, biscuits, caramel and yeast. Nevertheless very harmonic. Warm, alcoholic finish without strong spicy/peppery notes. Very good.","GERMANY","bartholos"

4504,"2017-04-11",3.2,"33cl bb11/2018, Maruhn. - Makes easy sipping from a heavyset style without any real surplus to make a case for it: Calypso adds some peach/mirabelle and candied lemon jam to the honey biscuit compote, but buries it malt-deep. Less alcoholic, syrupy and maltstarchy ""mastig"" than many a 7%ish Bock.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

4504,"2017-02-05",3.4,"0.33 l bottle from the brewerys web shop, best before January 2019. Clear, reddish amber with a medium large, frothy, almost stable, off-white head. Faint, sweetish-malty and a bit fruity aroma of caramel, honey, orange jam and hints of pine. Rather sweet, malty, slightly fruity and a little resiny taste of caramel, honey, straw, dried apricots, orange jam and hints of pine, followed by a medium long, moderately bitter, slightly resiny and a bit warming-alcoholic finish. Medium to full body, slightly oily and quite effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Quite tasty, a bit too much carbonation maybe, but the result could likely have been achieved with less alcohol I guess.","Hagen / Bonn, GERMANY","Zlotta"
