The mouthfeel is pure, thick mango juice with a sharper citrus sting and general tropical sweetness. Its sweet i would say, but the hop sting brings it down and theres actually a small tad of alcohol in the end. This was a pure mouthgasm, and the only thing I can say is not superb is that late alcohol sting, otherwise it would have been a pure fiver.","Örebro, SWEDEN","Hopmaestro"

 Kolor:  Przepiękny pomarańczowo-brzoskwiniowy kolor. Piwo jest mętne i gęste jak kisiel. 
 Piana:  Ten element mnie trochę zawiódł. Piana jest po prostu słabiutka.
Zaraz po przelaniu do szkła redukuje się z prędkością wystrzału z karabinu maszynowego.
Opada do milimetrowego łańcuszka.
Po paru chwilach i on znika bez powrotu.
Trudno określić jej kolor i strukturę. 
 Zapach:  Nie mogłem się już doczekać tego aromatu. Zapach bardzo przyjemny, trwały.
Pierwsze skojarzenia to cytrusy: świeże, dojrzałe mandarynki, pomarańcze i grejpfruty. Potem kapka melona i anansa.
W drugim rzucie sporo iglastych, leśnych klimatów.
Na koniec ziołowa woń i potem znowu chmiel.
Aromat nie odpuszcza nawet na chwilę. Po przelaniu do szkła nie traci na intensywności. 
Rewelacja! 
 Smak:  W smaku intensywne, bogata i niewiarygodnie soczyste. Poziom conajmniej Stigbergets Bryggeri i ich flagowego GBG Beer Week, tylko że tamto to standardowa wersja, a tutaj mamy podwójną.
Piwo miażdży intensywnością owoców cytrusowych. Całe kilogramy grejpfrutów, mandarynek, pomelo, ananasów i melonów rozpływają się po języku i podniebieniu.
Żywica skapuje po krawędziach szkła niczym po korze drzewa sosnowego.
Niesamowite ziołowe posmaki doskonale współgrają z krótką, żywiczną goryczką.
Goryczka jest niewiarygodnie harmonijna. Znika jeszcze przed kolejnym łykiem. Tekstura jak wyżej wspomniałem przypomina kisiel owocowy.
Tak rewelacyjne ukrycie procentów może przyprawiać o zawrót głowy. Doskonała pijalność.
Genialny trunek! Klasa światowa. 
 Wysycenie:  Średnie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

No Moi Drodzy! Rośnie wielki konkurent dla takich gigantów jak Pliny The Younger z Russian River Brewing Company, czy Heady Topper z The Alchemist.
Dla mnie poza lanym Pliny w Russian River w Santa Rosa to jest najlepsze Double IPA jakie piłem.
Co tak na prawdę wyróżnia go w tłumie?
Nieprawdopodobna soczystość, niewiarygodne ukrycie procentów, balans poszczególnych składowych i duże natężenie chmielu, przy jednoczesnym zachowaniu krótkiej, harmonijnej goryczki. 
Rewelacyjne piwo bez dwóch zdań. Uczta dla moich kubków smakowych.

Dzięki raz jeszcze Kamil R. za to piwko ;-)))","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

293,"2017-05-17",3.2,"Special lunchtime trip to Brewdog Clerkenwell to sample on keg. Initially shocked by the cloudy appearance that was more like a milkshake or fruit smoothie. Nose was all hops and the same went for the flavour; pine, hops and more pine followed by extra hops. I didnt get the subtle fruit that I have encountered with previous Cloudwater DIPA releases. The texture was thick and the mouthfeel was dominated by the hop oils that lingered long after I got back to the office (it was a cheeky lunchtime trip after all)! Overall I admire the beer, but I really didnt like it. To me it lacks the subtlety that I have encountered with my favourite DIPA - Brew By Numbers 55/01 - and the range of fruit flavours that I got from Cloudwater DIPA V6. This was more akin to being assaulted by hops, although I wont be pressing charges.","Hertford, Hertfordshire, ENGLAND","Davros IX"

Some creamy sweetness from the malts as they battle through the hop onslaught. Light dry spicy finish leaves a spicy bitter linger. Excellent stuff, a little more bitter than the numbered run of DIPAs. Not quite as complex as Id like it but I reckon this will develop more over the next 7 days or so. 4.1 Mother Kellys. Keg. Instant impression of a brighter fresher beer. Stunning combo of orange, lemon and grapefruit citrus supremely well joined up with mango led tropical fruits.

293,"2017-05-10",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2017 May 2017 - 440ml can at home in Richmond, picked up in Realale Twickenham, as Cloudwater NW DIPA Citra, 9%, hit the shops yesterday and its BB date is in 3 weeks time! Pours an opaque cloudy orange, initial foamy off-white head dies quickly. Aroma is really fruity - lots of apricot, pineapple, grapefruit and some simple syrup alongside grassy hops. Body is quite light, tingly carbonation, touch frothy. Taste is assertive grassy hops, peachy sugars, like biting into some sort of bitter peach, mango and floral hops, warming booze showing up but not offputting. The Lees yeast gets a little distracting in the finish - maybe overly spicy and sticks in the throat a touch.  But what I love about this is that its properly hoppy in a way a lot of New England IPAs arent. It is currently averaging 4.4 and I didnt think there was any way it could meet that kind of expectation. But I was wrong. Wow. (4.4)
May 2017 - Another can at home watching The Staircase documentary.  Picked up at Hop, Burns and Black.  Seems even spicier than last time.  Not quite showing the fruity vibrancy.  Probably wouldnt rate this as highly.","Richmond, Greater London, ENGLAND","The_Osprey"

293,"2017-05-04",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2017 Can fresh from the brewery via eebria, out of the box, into the fridge, straight in my face. It pours turbid, mega cloudy golden - orange with a decent white head.

The taste is crisp, dry, good bitter bite upfront and throughout, green, grassy, danky, pine needles, resinous, tannin, dried mango, guava, dragonfruit, passion fruit, good alcohol hit and some decent spice through the finish.

Drank side by side with Trillium Citra Cutting Tiles (canned 3/4/17)
Murky turbid burnt orange appearance. Foamy head, dissipating moderately quickly. Huge nose, over ripe papaya, mango and citrus, floral sweet honey as warms. 
Taste is overpowering! More overripe tropical/citrus fruit, followed rapidly by massive dank chewy resin and an almost acrid aftertaste. Malts barely get a look in. Tongue coating hop oils and a thick luxurious, slightly grainy, mouth feel.
