The aroma is malty, its got a nice toasty character, some red apple & some nice caramel. Its got a touch of booziness to the nose, but never really comes across as a terribly sweet smelling. 

The flavor is big on the malt & booze in a similar way to how the aroma is. Its got a tastiness, some rich caramel, & some lightly tart fruit most particularly red apple. It pulls off the malt forward thing while staying far away from cloying sweetness, which is a charming touch. For a beer of 5.2% alcohol this one really comes across considerably boozier than it is, which is a real pity as it sort of throws off the balance of an otherwise very pleasant beer.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

1308,"2014-03-07",4.2,"12oz bottle poured into an thin Allagash tulip. No date on bottle. Label different than the current picture on this site. Has a small but strong long lasting head, never fully fades. Body is dark brown, cannot see through it. Aroma is strong: earthy yeast notes surrounded by dry and bitter brown malts. Smells as a Scottish should: strong but earthy with just a wee bit of toffee/butterscotch. Flavor blows my mind: the right kind of caramel with a present bitter malt character. Not sugary but sweet caramel that is powerful and absolutely counteracted by a dry, well attenuated flavor and malt bitterness. The bitterness sticks around as the drying aftertaste of earth, bark, and soil mix with a nicely lean body. I can taste the beer for minutes on in after a sip. Just amazingly well made and one of the best Scottish-style ales I have ever had. Filtered beer as I see nothing at the bottom of the bottle.

Mouthfeel is medium light to light with medium low carbonation that helps the mouthfeel feel bigger. Low astringency with low alcohol warmth.

1308,"2012-08-20",3.0,"Appearance: Sláinte pours a dark brown with some blood red at the edges, especially when held to the light. It had an awesome three fingers worth of head that is khaki brown and is retained a fairly long time before it settles to a film on the beer. Lacing is light to moderate and carbonation does seem evident. 

Smell: Upfront I smell a sweet malty beer. I am getting toasted bread, caramel and some smoke in there, too. 

Taste: A bready toasted note with a sweet malty taste is the prominent flavors here. Im also getting molasses and a brown sugar mixed with a finish of smoke and a slight bitterness. 

Mouthfeel: Creamy feel to this one. It does go down easy and has a nice amount of carbonation that seems to help cut some of the sweetness. There is no note of the alcohol. 

Overall: Not my favorite style I must admit but this one is enjoyable if youre in the mood for a rich, sweet, malty beer.","Illinois, USA","Sleuthdogg"
1308,"2012-07-20",3.8,"Aroma is malts, fruit and a hint of coffee and nuttiness.  The flavor is malts, mild vinous/dark fruit notes and a mix of sweet and tart in the finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
1308,"2012-07-07",3.7,"Chicago bottle from Binnys downtown. Dark brown pour with ruby highlights and a thin brown head. Huge aroma that I can smell from the nightstand: rich, sweet malts with a little molasses. Creamy mouthfeel. Pretty classic Scottish ale with sweet, caramelly goodness and hints of smoke. Very nice.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BelgianBeerGal"
1308,"2012-06-08",3.7,"bottle and served in my La Chouffe tulip:  Pours a rich brown hue with ruby highlights topped by a nice creamy off-white head that left excellent lace upon the glassware. The aroma has notes of caramel, chocolate, roast, bready malts along with some dark fruit, earthy tobacco and minerals with just a hint of smoke. The taste is malt forward as expected with some twangy fruit and herbal hops. There is a nice brash earthiness upon the slightly smoky finish. Surprisingly noticeable alcohol for something that is only 5.3 % ABV. The mouth feel is oily and ashy but must say not as lush or sticky as I would like, I think the aggressive carbonation is the blame. Overall I think this is a fine beer and something I would try again.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
1308,"2012-05-24",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2014 Dark brown color with a medium head.  Biscuit and light chocolate aroma.  Strong biscuit flavor.  Light alcohol.  Tastes a bit like very dry crackers.

Rerating 1/14/13: dark brown with a medium head.  Light caramel and biscuit aroma.  Deep molasses, caramel and malt flavors.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
1308,"2012-05-14",3.6,"12 oz bottle from the Binnys Singles Rack (Naperville, IL). Pours a rich deep brownish ruby hue, healthy haze, deeper dark brown body shows some flashes of red in edges and bottom, dark and inviting with a cakey brownish head atop, stays as a firm layer and laces ok. Aromas are sticky sweet caramel, touches of red stone fruit, cherries and toffee, toast and biscuits. A gentle peaty essence gives some life as more toast, biscuits, and sweet sticky malts come on board. A bit creamy, gentle kiss of earth and faint dusting of cocoa. Initial is heavier end of medium bodied offering a firm toast and dryness up front, biscuits and carmelized malts meet touches of dry earthy hops, a gentle kiss of heat. Brown malts, earthy and toasty, tobacco, cocoa, and more firm toasty malts into the middle. A touch of sweet sticky girthy quality rears its head, some caramel, toffee, and dark fruit. A lot more credit is due here.. Not just the sticky sweet typical one, offering some peaty dryness, carmelization yet still a firm body, deeper darker malts, sticky yet not cloying or too heavy. A touch of heat, signature brown malt feel. Solid beer. Almost a brown porter for my money though..","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
1308,"2012-04-29",3.8,"Picked up a single 12-oz bottle from Heritage Liquors in Maplewood, MN. Pours a dark orangish brown copper ale with a thick beige head that slowly dissipates to a clean disk with some minor spotty lacing. Aroma of heavy caramel malt, a hint of toffee-like fudge, and a little white pepper. Taste is quite smooth, medium to full bodied, flavors of some lightly smoked dark malts, chocolate, caramel and light vanilla. Finish is still smooth with an aftertaste of dark caramel, with  a touch of white pepper and mild bitterness. A touch more body and spicy bitterness compared to the retired CW Loch Ness Scotch Ale.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
1308,"2012-04-15",3.3,"Pours clear espresso brown with frothy tan tinged head that dissipates. Aroma is nutty raisin, earthy woods and faint peat. Flavor is mild raisin, peat, vanilla and mild smokiness. Body is light with medium carbonation.","Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA","Tripplebrew"
1308,"2012-03-18",3.5,"An average beer in a good style--that is, this isnt a great Scottish ale but it possesses most of the qualities of what is a rich style, so its a decent beer. Dark brown, decent deep beige head. Moderate carbonation and body. Rich malts, caramel, and a notable hop presence. Good. Bottle.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

1308,"2012-03-14",3.7,"Full body and malt flavor, nice finish though could have a smoother after-palate. A beer fitting with most meats and most women :)

Thanks to madvike for providing me with another Wisconsin fix. One of the primary reasons was to sample this new (to the bottle) release from Central Waters. They tend to have a track record of success. This is no exception and while it might not be the best it is very close.

Aroma / Appearance - The minimal head sits like the last pieces of ice melting on a frozen lake. Creamy long legs crawl down the sides. Reddish purple in color the deepness indicates that this is not going to lay down and be yet another scottish ale. Chocolate pudding, plums, flat cola, and malt drive the attention towards the sweet fruity aspects of this beer.

Flavor / Palate - Warm and boozy from the start this has a memorable impression from the first sip. Chocolate dipped cherry twizzlers chased by a piece of slightly burnt toast warms the back of the throat. Creamy and full this is sweet and smoky at the same time. Once again Central Waters has done a great job of crafting a solid release.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
1308,"2012-03-12",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2014 Bottle. Very dark pour with a nice light tan head. Nose is rather mild - some caramel malts. Nice smooth palate with good density. Taste is great - smooth chocolate, caramel, malty - nice balance and character. Very well done!","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
1308,"2012-02-18",3.6,"12oz bottle from ncmussel. Pouts dark toffee brown with tan head. Aromas of peat, chocolate, caramel, and earthy malts. Flavors of toffee, caramel, bit of peat, nice malty base, and a touch of bitterness in the finish. Pretty nice ale overall.","Mount Prospect, Illinois, USA","msante79"

1308,"2012-02-05",3.7,"12oz bottle. Pours a deep brown, slightly ruby tinted body with a finger-width, creamy, brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a lots of pretty lacing throughout. Aroma is deep malts with a moderate caramel sweetness, bready toast, and a good amount of dark fruit raisins. Some cocoa, molasses, and a touch of smoke and roast. Flavor is creamy chocolates and caramels with some bready toast up front before a good amount of raisin dark fruits, toffee, and a nice smokey roast come in. Finishes toasty, slightly roasty with a hint of peat smoke, and slightly dry with a light bitterness and a really creamy, smooth, chocolate, dark fruit, leathery caramel and toffee maltiness before leaving a lengthy aftertaste. Medium, very creamy and smooth body with a soft, creamy, moderate carbonation. Overall, a very nice Scottish Ale. Rich, creamy, and malty smooth with a really nice toasty, roasty, cocoa malt backing. Very easy drinking and enjoyable. Good beer.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
1308,"2012-01-29",3.3,"Poured a dark brown-red with a minimal mocha head that faded to very light lacing.  Aroma was of malts - slight roasted hues.  Taste was very nice - a sweet malt start with a slightly smokey, moderate hop finish.  Palate was nice.  Overall a nice scottish ale.  Nice job Central Waters!","Town of Maple Creek, Wisconsin, USA","dekester1"
1308,"2012-01-19",3.6,"This is something of a strong bitter or perhaps an American amber. It is a dark, cloudy red beer w/ a small tan head of evenly sized bubbles. This is a rich, malt-accented brew w/ a touch of roasted character. Lower levels of carbonation make it come across as full-bodied, especially for a lower gravity brew. There is a bit of plum and cherry-like fruitiness and a subtle but firm bitterness in the finish. This is a really nice brew that works for wintertime slow-sipping despite its moderate alcohol content.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
1308,"2012-01-17",3.6,"Pours dark with a creamy tan head that disipates rather quick. There is a strong raosted aroma and a flavor that has hints of caramel and chocolate. The finish is dry and bitter but the body is smooth and rich. Central Waters always seems to deliver and their new scotch ale is no exception. Slainte!","Neenah, Wisconsin, USA","mcjay"
1308,"2012-01-16",3.7,"Bottle. Pours a mahogany brown with a khaki colored head that fades to a wispy film and soapy collar. Aroma has some chocolate leather and tobacco. Taste has a bitterness of malt and chocolate, molasses, leather and tobacco. Palate is medium a little watery and chalky with a dry finish. I enjoyed this one good flavor and drinkable!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"

1308,"2012-01-07",3.7,"Bottle - Pours deep mahogany with a fluffy tan head. Big and malty aroma, with molasses notes, a bit of smoky peat, a fleeting metal note, and a touch of alcohol. Pretty blah nose. Taste is much better--big, bold malt notes with vanilla, toffee, hints of coffee and smoke. Whiff of whiskey and some warmth through the finish. Pretty thick and smooth. Lots going on here. Isnt my style, but I really liked it.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
1308,"2011-12-23",3.4,"Nto my favorite style but I tried it anyways. nice rich color and taste. Pretty roasty for a scotch ale imo and also not as sweet, more of a sessionable beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
1308,"2011-12-20",3.8,"Deep, deep brown with red hues and yellow/tan head.  Aroma of roasted and toasted malt, dark fruit, raisin, toasted bread, mild brown sugar.  Initial toasted malt sweetness/some dark fruit followed by a moderate roasted malt character and mild plum/raisin in the background.  Could have used a little less of the roast and a bit more of the caramelized fruit/maltiness for the style.  Residual roasted malt and some burnt biscuit.  Some sticky malt.  A semi- lop-sided version of the style that, with all things considered, is pretty flavorful and a successful offering.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
1308,"2011-12-19",3.9,"12oz bottle.  Unfiltered, deep, opaque, amber-brown.  Thick, creamy, beige head.  Mellow malty aroma, maybe a touch of fruity vanilla, amber malt.  Wow, this is really quite well done.  Creamy, smooth caramel and chocolate malt tones, very rich.  Relatively true to style, maybe a little heavier on the specialty malts.  Some red fruit and nuttiness.  A lot of depth, well made beer.  Solid.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
