1464,"2017-05-21",3.9,"Apparence : Pas totalement noire, léger col brun, peu ou pas de rétention, ne laissant quun petit anneau sur le contour du verre. 
Nez : Torréfaction, légère fumée, chocolat noir, toffee. 
Goût : Torréfaction, toffee un peu sucré, bois astringent, finale sur un chocolat noir et des notes brûlées et amères. 
Sensation : Corps moyen, longue finale, aspect piquant qui ne me semble pas provenir de leffervescence, peut-être plus du bois ou encore des notes fumées. 
Bref : Le nez est bien invitant, cest bon en bouche, mais les notes dun bois astringent, voire âcre, sont un trop prononcées à mon goût; comme si le nez avait su sharmoniser davantage que le liquide. Une fois vraiment chambrée, ces excès disparaissent : la bière est plus accessible, mais perd alors son caractère unique. Cette finale brûlée peut dailleurs rappeler ce que jai perçu avec la Abyss Rye.","Quebec, CANADA","Adamsville"

Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready/peat malt, vanilla/orange peel spice, and bourbon/scotch barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/scotch/oak spiciness; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from bitter/spiciness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/silky, and lightly sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden; a mild pleasing warmth after the finish, with zero barrel booziness. Overall this is an outstanding imperial porter style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready/peat malt, vanilla/orange peel spice, and bourbon/scotch barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV. Amazing balance and integration of all flavors; with great barrel presence for only being a 50% blend. The Bourbon and Scotch barrels come through with perfectly equal balance.
