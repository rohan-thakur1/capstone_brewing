2334,"2016-01-23",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 24, 2016 New (and expensive) oak aged version of Chimay Grande R√©serve, from ¬ínew¬í oak casks according to the label. Thick, creamy, pale yellowish beige, lacing head over a misty deep brownish bronze coloured beer, looking the same as the original. Lovely and rich quad aroma of fig, peach, banana bread, red cabbage with brown sugar, oaky vanilla-like tannins, some wet wood, caramel, candied cherry, ruby port, honey, bayleaf, beef stock, jasmine, amaretto. Soft sweetish fruity onset of candied cherry, raisin, fig and banana with a subtle blackberry sourishness, softish carbo, full, mellow and ¬ífluffy¬í body of sweetish caramelly and honeyish malts, thick and smooth with a slight nutty edge, evolving into a complex, satisfying finish of ongoing creamy malt sweetness and dito candi sugar sweetness, drying wood effects with retronasal vanilla tannins, light spicy hops for bittering balance and warming, whisky-like alcohol all the way at the back. Chimay Grande R√©serve is rich and flavourful enough as it is, especially at a certain age, but in this case, the wooden barrels have effectively made it better: contrary to e.g. Sint-Bernardus Oak Aged, there is no added liquor flavour here, just the tannin-rich oak adding a subtle drought and an extra layer of aroma and taste. There is no doubt that this, like its regular version, can age beautifully if properly cellared for a few years.  Overwhelming, rounded, opulent: this is everything one can expect from a trappist quadrupel.

Nice warming sensation. Medium body and carbonation. Quite pleasant.","Oirschot, THE NETHERLANDS, NETHERLANDS","Benzai"
2334,"2015-12-20",3.9,"Bottle at the Essen Winter Beer Festival, 2015. Poured a murky medium brown with a frothy round off white head. The aroma is coconut, vanilla, red berry fruit. The flavour is moderate sweet with a rich fruity oak alcoholic bitter palate. Medium bodied with lively carbonation and a bubbly mouthfeel.","Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA","jmgreenuk"
2334,"2015-12-20",4.2,"I tried this special edition of Chimay yesterday and I must say: not bad, not bad at all... Dark brown beer (as we know), beige header. High carbonation, medium body. Aroma is sweet, complex, banana, raisins, vanilla. You can taste the wooden cask. Aftertaste is about the same. There¬ís too much taste of alcohol, I must say.","Bruges, BELGIUM","Centje"

Could¬íve been first... damn you back log!

Taste: dried fruits, raisins, bit oxidized, spicy touch. Aftertaste: caramel, fruity, malty, raisins, some vanilla, little bitter.","Gent, BELGIUM","tderoeck"
2334,"2015-12-02",2.8,"750 ml bottle at home. Pours dark amber with a small head. Nice vanilla oak aroma, but alcohol reveals itself quite quickly. Differentiates very little to the 20-like variations of La Trappe Oak Aged series. Light palate (where is the malt base we used to know from the Bleu Chimay?!), high on alcohol, not very amused. It really is unagreeable, some salty harsch taste is the only thing that counters a bit the alcohol burn (tastes gradually from fridge temeprature to room t¬∞). Dissapointed.","Linden, BELGIUM","gEUS"

Par rapport √† la chimay bleue classique, celle ci poss√®de un nez d¬íune complexit√© remarquable, des notes √©pic√©es, fruit√©es et torr√©fi√©es auxquelles s¬íajoute la vanille du f√ªt neuf et une pointe de pain grill√©. En bouche la puissance est √©norme, la mat√®re imposante et la complexit√© impressionnante. La longueur et kilom√©trique et l¬í√©quilibre parfait. Une des plus grandes bi√®res que j¬íai eu l¬íoccasion de d√©guster.","Mons, BELGIUM","Ysok02"
