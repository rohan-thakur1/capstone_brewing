3330,"2013-12-31",3.1,"Bottle, at Nærbø Ølfestival 2013. A crystal clear, dark golden beer topped by a very small, white head. The aroma has pale malts and grassy hops, with a note of hay and some piney hops. Sweetish and fruity on the palate, medium bodied and semidry with an ok carbonation. Some citrusy hops too in the flavor. Dry, bitter and fruity-sweet finish. A quite nice one, even better fresh I guess. 131019","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
3330,"2013-12-29",2.9,"Vom Faß in Bruckmayers Biergarten, Pottenstein (Sept. 2013). Das Faß trug den Schriftzug vom Weismainer Pülsbräu. Auf meine Nachfrage hin bestätigte mir die Kellnerin, das Bier werde in Weismain gebraut, ""nach unserem Rezept"". Dieses Bier wird also nicht mehr bei St. Georgen in Buttenheim gebraut - und das schmeckt man leider! - Enorm zäher Schaum, der auch nach 5 Minuten Zuwartens nicht verschwunden war. Antrunk fruchtig-herb-hopfig wie bei einem guten Ungespundeten. Schwach rezent. Nachtrunk bitter, aber weniger aromatisch als bei diesem Antrunk erwartet. - Insgesamt ein mittelmäßiges, arg einspuriges Kellerbier ohne die sortentypische Aromenfülle.","Beijing, CHINA","Moravius"

3330,"2012-11-20",2.9,"Bottle from Cotteridge Wines, Birmingham. For once, the Bish appears to be talking some sense. This is all about bread; wholemeal sweet bread. Rather a flat, lifeless, minerally, boring finish, with some cornflakes box. Didnt really deliver the after-work, Lager recuperation I was looking for. On the plus side, I do love these unpretentious labels, which are utterly indifferent to zeitgeist, coolness or marketing. This label is so dull, that it actually comes back round to brilliant again.","Birmingham (via Leicester), West Midlands, ENGLAND","DanielBrown"

Der Hopfen bewirkt einen weiteren positiven Schub, untertönig wenig röstig, stimmig. Das Bier bleibt nun konstant, die urige Würzigkeit bleibt aber noch sehr lange bestehen.

I ordered a St Georgen Kellerbier and motelpogo ordered this - we both smelled our beers and simultaneously looked up at eachother and said ""Wow"". This one was an orangey copper colour, clear with good foam. Big peach and apricot fruit, German hops, glue, sweet sweet malt and a chalky finish. Massive flavours and massive deliciousness.

(0.5l mug on tap at the Bruckmayer brewery inn, which claimed they made it. This was 2005-09-01, so maybe things have changed since 2003. Not sure.)

Probably named after the famous Teufelshöhle (devils cave) just outside Pottenstein.","Oslo, NORWAY","larsga"
3330,"2003-07-06",4.4,"Pilsener, it says on the label, and there is no alcohol percentage mentioned. Beer, brewed by St Georgen for the brand new Wagner Brewery in Pottenstein. The old one was closed a few years ago and then taken over by a local entrepreneur.
Is it a pilsener? I have some doubts. The color is on the dark side. But it is a top class beer! Big creamy head. Lovely hops, citrus and mango aroma. Very hoppy, almost oily, citric flavor with vanilla. Long citric bitter finish. It tastes a bit like a Poperings Hommelbier, in fact it tastes even better than that!","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
