3590,"2016-08-24",3.7,"This bottled Sake from a bottle shop poured a extremely small sized head of frothy medium sized clear colored bubbles that were very quickly diminishing and left behind a uncarbonated transparent clear colored body and no lacing. The strong aroma was green apple musty and mild vinous. The mildly vinous clean mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish with a lingering vinous aftertaste. The balanced flavor contained notes of polished rice and vinous. A decent one that I would consider drinking again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

3590,"2012-02-05",2.2,"Bottle. No head (still). Body is colorless. Aroma is notes of potato, grain/rice, glue, alcohol. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, no carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic, lightly astringent. Pretty bad...typical cheap sake odors with some raw potato to boot.  Not much to balance the sweetness, watery texture, and a hot/burning finish.  The only thing nice about it is the bottle it comes in, sadly.  Swill sake despite the price.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

3590,"2008-06-07",2.9,"Bottle.  Aroma is lightly tapiocaish with a bit of pear and melon, but otherwise there isnt a whole lot going on in here.  Light black pepper and a bit of graininess.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

3590,"2006-10-14",3.2,"Being the first person to rate a sake makes a tyro like me nervous, but here goes - -  The pour is crystal clear and thin, barely clinging to the sides of the glass.  The aroma is newly mown grassess with a touch of musk melon and the warmth of alcohol.  Its not much thicker than water in the mouth, the alcohol only making its presence known by a light peppery feel on the tongue.  The flavor is more subtle than other sakes that Ive tried, mainly sweet grassess, melon rind, and a suggestion of banana, all warmed by the alcohol.  The finish is fairly dry.  Milder in flavor than most that Ive tasted, I think this sake bears repeating.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?
