583,"2016-12-30",4.2,"{From 2011 notes). 11.2 oz distinctive and heavy bottle served in pint glass. Best by date 1 full year in the future (3/2012). Different labeling: now sold as a brune 8 rather than a dubbel 8. Still described on the reverse as a Belgian dubbel. 

light pour produced nearly 4 cm of head, causing the need for a 2nd pour. Moderately thick and quite sticky light tan head has excellent retention and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass all the way down. Slightly hazy, dark mahogany color.

The subtle spicy aroma is not the strong point of this beer. The flavor is more bold, rich and complex than what I could pick up from the scent. Aroma does convey higher ABV and ample malt. Back to that complex flavor. There is a lot going on here, with a terrific dynamic interplay of well-balanced flavor components from the sweet spicy start through to the toasted malt, spice, earthiness and mild bitterness of the finish. 

M - medium/full body, creamy with a nice dryness in the finish.

It¬ís everything I love about a quad, advertised in a dubbel. Great sweet malts, and a lovely raisin and caramel balance really set this one up to be good. It¬ís sweet, but not overly so, and there are plenty of fruits to help balance it out. The flavor is definitely more robust. There is a strong maltiness to it. It¬ís a nice bitter roasty malt. It¬ís got a nice burnt chocolate malt that really rounds it out nicely. There is a nice fruitiness that is lovely.

583,"2016-06-02",3.4,"33cl bottle at home (2 VI 2016). A classic abbey dubbel from Belgium, dark almost black coloured yet with a dark red gloom. A huge frothy beige collar tops the brew and is quite long lasting. The nose already spots the alcoholic body, with port, red wine and dark red fruits hints. Belgian yeasts and some malts are very present too. There is sweetness in the flavours with a caramel, toffee or chocolate roundness. This nose is very inviting for sure. The mouthfeel actually is quite sweet. The sugar and alcohol comes in first; not subtle at all. A medium carbonation and a softening bitterness follows. The spiritful body is rather dry, hinting at cognac or whisky, even brandy. The ending is not that long lasting. The fruity and chocolate features now appear to be artificial - which I dislike in this brew. There is some leather in there as well, maybe some nuts (hinting at that dryness).

Opens with a decent puff and pours brown with a good-sized foamy head and red-orange highlights into my Duvel tulip. Aroma is in part what one would expect of a dubbel -- spices, cola, apple, sweet brown bread -- but also an ample part of stale skunked lager, like the way a trash bag of crushed empties used to smell when as a kid I would collect cans for the 10 cent refund after Michigan games in the Big House. 

The flavor is also pretty much as expected. A bit sweet early, ricola-drop spices, dry yeast notes with tannic red grape skins late, earthy/mouldy. Missing the flavor intensity that one might hope for.  Pretty nice mouthfeel, spot on for the style: effervescent on the tongue, little heat from the 8%.

Poured from bottle to New Belgium tulip.

A:Deep cherry red; no visible ribbons. Light crosses thru beer with good clarity. Loose bubbles hold a foamy cap, which is light tan in color.

S: Roasted barley complimented by slight lacto-bacil pungency. Slight almond/praline tone.

T: Deep, roasted chocolate with hints of praline. Light espresso aftertaste. Toward the end, ale was a bit sour. Alcohol faintly available in taste.

M: Medium body with sharp, stinging carbonation.

583,"2013-12-07",3.3,"330ml bottle bought at Craftissmo in Tsim Sha Tsui East.
Translucent dark copper brown colour with dirt like yeast sediments; One finger head and crumpet off-white foam which lasts for 2 minutes; Excellent lacing and notable small bubbly carbonation; Aroma of malt, with light alcohol, sugar, caramel, dark chocolate, cream and light grass; Medium sweet and tart taste of malt, with sour cherries, red fruits, sugar, alcohol, Bel yeast, strong lime, liquorices and herbal hops; Mid to light body; watery palate; Mouthfeel is thin and alcoholic, also sour cherry taste is quite unexpected but pretty nice, balancing the sweetness and booze quite handsomely. Not as rich or spicy as other Dubbels, it¬ís made up by the strong booze, fruitiness and adequate Bel yeast, a bit like Leffe¬ís Biere de Noel without the spicyness¬Ö Cherry tartness is quite expressive, adds up pretty well with the sugar and hops; Hoppiness is strong cherry and slight grass in nose, very strong lime and moderate herbal grass in taste. Liquorices is just-right for a low bitterness to counter the sugar very well. Abrupt finish; Slightly dry after taste. Easy and boozy to mouth.

Comments: This one has unique sour cheery taste a la English Strong Ale, and potent yet nice booze to boost. However its body is thin and watery, taste elements is rather scarce, and not enough spicyness to be top. An interesting Dubbel cum ESA, slightly above the middle packs, still worth a try.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

Visual: Clear brown, with a thick, creamy and dense head, lasting several minutes and presenting a very nice lacing.
Taste: Attack is presenting a lot of yeasty accents with a sustained acidity. Very subtle notes of wood and field berries. Wild yeasts are dominant with a continuous acidity accompanied with orange and lemon notes. Bittering hops are combining with acidity to offer a slightly unpleasant finish.

583,"2013-09-28",4.1,"Pours a chestnut brown with ruby hues. Deep color that slightly hazed. Fat tan head of creamy foam that falls to a thick cap and wet lace. 

Nose is subtle and gentle. It has dark fruit like plum and a light sweet molasses. The grains are toasted and there is a bit of  bread. The lightest scent of cocoa can be found but no alcohol. Yeast is earthy and it has a bit of spice. As it warms the spices come out more and the character lets itself be seen only slowly. Touch of clove and a bit of mineral. No alcohol on the nose. 

Taste is smooth and gentle. The dried fruit and the chocolate are inseparable and the chocolate is terribly light. It makes you reach a little to find it and that brings you to a delightful middle. There¬ís some anise but it¬ís not sharp and some drying alcohol as well as a dry malt character that is a touch bitter in itself. The hops give a light gentle bitter for accent and the finish is earthy and lightly sweet. 

The body of this beer is soft and yet it¬ís full without heaviness. The alcohol is sturdy so be careful because it drinks so easily. There is the faintest hint of smoke in the finish and you will take three or four more sips before your are sure. The anise on this is spectacular. I was expecting chocolate and when I realized the anise lightly permeating the drink I was delighted. This beer is like a gentle breath.

The spices and malts develop and are joined by clove and orange flavours, (perhaps a bit of bruised apple?) but these recede towards a dry finish, returning to the leafy hops and bittering character.

583,"2012-10-02",3.9,"ABV 8%
Bottle of 330 ml at home, poured into a chalice, after letting it warm up a bit. It gave me one and a half fingers of beige head, with average retention and I mean by that that biggest part of the foam went away but a quite thick layer of it stayed on the surface. Heavy lacing around the glass. What I really liked was the colour, very very deep bruin, it looked almost black while sitting on the table and no light was held agianst it.
Aroma: When I opened the bottle I smelled some dark fruits. Now that the beer sits in the glass, I smell caramel and roasted malts mostly and less than before the fruits. An excellent aroma.
The roasted malts are very notable on the taste too, one could say that they overtake any other element of the beer¬ís flavour. Slighty bitter though, leaves behind an iron aftertaste. Reminded me faintly of Guiness and the fact that the alcohol is so finely concealed surely help. It¬ís like you¬íre drinking a beer with at least 3% less alcohol. 
A full, thick body, with a light amount of carbonation.
It¬ís been a while since I had the other two of the Maredsous family. but I don¬ít remember them impressing me as much as this one. A really great beer and as it warms up becomes better, has now got rid of the metallic aftertaste and it goes down very smoothly. I will recommend and buy again.","Arnhem, NETHERLANDS","Christos"

Rather hard to describe the aroma as I had a slight cold at the time of tasting... It¬ís pretty fresh with most clearly hops but more complex aromas underneath, a bit of caramel and something fruity. In the background I pick up some alcohol.
At first the taste is a little light for an 8% beer but it does have a special glow to it, not merely alcoholic but more in the vein of a barley wine. A little bit metallic on the tongue, not unpleasant but as it takes away from the overall fullness of the taste it leads to that impression of a lighter beer.
The aftertaste consists of a lingering bitter touch, something metallic bordering on grassy, lightly alcoholic, almost the soapiness of a tripel but considerably sweeter and rounder.","All over Belgium, BELGIUM","Noctilucus"

Der Abgang ist leider etwas nichtssagend, hier fehlt f√ºr meinen Geschmack ganz klar Hopfen. Insgesamt ein untypisches Braunes, das mit erfrischender Note punkten kann und nicht alkoholdeftig ist! Vom Typ her eher ein gehaltvolles Hefe-Weizen, gelungen!

Irresistable flavors, too: rich malt sweetness balanced by tangy hops, toffee, sweet bread, fruit cake, toasted whole-grain bread, plum sauce, raisins, dried apricots, complex tannis reminiscent of wood, nuts, tea. Medium body and carbonation, sticky pudding mouthfeel, everlasting fruity and bready aftertaste. Alcohol was apparent, but not at all harsh, like a fine aged port or brandy.

583,"2011-11-11",3.5,"Location: 11.2. Bottle at Cap Ale, 9/10/11


Aroma: The aroma is fairly malts, some roast, caramel, and brown sugar

Appearance: The pour is a brown color, with a slight red hue, and a tan head

Flavor: The taste is medium (plus) sweet, heavy malty, with a light-medium bitterness

Palate: The body is medium-full, with a fairly long duration, light heat, and a somewhat dry finish

Overall Impression: 
I¬ím sure I¬íve said this in enough ratings at this point, but I can¬ít believe I¬íve never rated this one before.  I¬ím pretty sure I¬íve had a few of these just in the last 6 months, but I never jotted down any notes or a rating until this one, because I just assumed I¬íd already rated it.

4.5 S: Lovely dark fruits, especially plum, some raisin, some tobacco to cap it off.

5.0 T: All the crap in the nose is in the taste too, though tobacco takes a back seat. Then there is a wave of flavors that result from the yeast. Spiciness with lots of pepper hitting you hard. A little medicinal, but not in a bad way. Alcohol shows up to the party too, but isn¬ít overwhelming. This beer is incredibly complex and I¬ím not sure I could find a better dubbel.

Brown color with reddish hues. Small, ivory-colored and thick head. Some lacings.

The smell is quite nice. Fruits of the forest. Chocolate covered soft banana-flavored candy. Plenty of yeast. Caramel malts. A rather big, powerful and interesting smell.

The taste is not nearly as interesting as the smell, nor is it as powerful and dense. Plenty of bread-like malts. Some caramel and chocolate covered soft banana-flavored candy. Butterscotch. The finish is actually quite dull and short - it¬ís minimally bitter and has some faint candy-like flavors and spicy alcohol.

Lighter body and more carbonation than expected. It almost feels somewhat bland.

It drinks quite easily, but it wasn¬ít that great. The taste was somewhat of a letdown considering the smell. I¬íve had this one served in bottle as well and the bottled version is far better than this one.

Flavor is mostly of roasted malt, and that¬ís about it. Just a lot of neutral malt flavor. Creamy but fizzy mouthfeel, medium viscosity. I was a little underwhelmed here and definitely prefer the 10 to this one. Decent, but very forgettable. Overall, good.","California, USA","Gypsy19"
583,"2009-09-21",3.6,"Pours a slightly hazy dark ruby tinted brown with a tall, chunky light tan head that has excellent retention. Aroma is dark caramel, dark fruits, yeasty bread dough, almond and spice. Flavor is caramel, woody notes, dark fruits, overripe peaches, some vinous notes, and maybe a little roast. Finishes woody, dark fruit and molasses cookies, there is a lightly roasty, molasses fade. Palate is medium bodied, pretty heavily carbonated, dry entry, kinda syrupy for a bit in the middle and an oddly very dry finish, a little too dry with the sharp carbonation. Overall this is pretty good stuff, there are a few problems with it, notably that the alcohol gets a bit too strong as it warms, but it¬ís pretty tasty overall.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

Appealing aromas of red licorice, roses (I¬ím not the only one), a faceless blend of dark fruits, candy, background caramel - once I finally noticed it it was there, lingering like an unwanted relative (which in this case was good) - a dull sweetness and spice quality. All of that took a lot of smelling and imagination though - I would have preferred if these aromas would have been a little more upfront. Later on everything just blends together and I am left with a subdued aroma.

It looks as though Maredsous has updated their labels. Good for them. Best Before: 06 2011. Close call!

Appearance: Pours a chestnut-hued body with some reddish hints to it and a tall, though short-lived, light khaki-colored head.

Smell: Blend of rich, dark malts layered in plenty of fruit notes: green apple, plum, poached figs, black cherry, even a generous splash of Cointreau.

Taste: Flavorful, malty mixture of dark caramel, spiced brown sugar, cocoa, and a drop or two of milk stout. Mild sweetness that¬ís quickly tempered by a dose of dusty, earthy spices, punchy blend of fruit liqueurs, and slight bitterness. Drying, warming, even roasty finish. Oh, and it¬ís pretty crisp, too!

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Moderate carbonation.

Drinkability: It¬ís tasty and enjoyable enough to hold my interest throughout each of the 11.2 ounces. Well, that was a fairly fine dubbel. I ought to be damned ashamed of myself for waiting nearly four years since the last one. Recommended.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Very nice aroma. I sense both strawberries and cherries in this beer, and also a load of chocolate. The aroma is close to 8 instead of 7. The appearance isn‚Äôt worse either, actually the brown colour is very beautiful, and the head lasts nearly forever. It even becomes more dense if you leave it be for a while. 
Now to the important stuff:
The taste. At first it seems quite sweet and chololaty, but then the alcohol goes through, together with a taste that reminds me of matured beer on casks. Some might say that the alcohol is too obvious, but I actually find it pleasing. It creates some kind of harmony, with the sweetness allthough the taste unfortunately isn‚Äôt as complex as I hoped for.

583,"2008-08-24",4.3,"After reading Michael Jackson‚Äôs book Great Beers of Belgium and reading his raves about Maredsous and their beers, I of course had to jump at the opportunity to try one which the venerable Beer Hunter himself rated as one of his all-time favorite Belgian beers.

Pours a gorgeous rich moist earthen brown, like fresh soil, with a beautiful tan head at least 2 fingers thick. It takes a couple minutes for the head to settle into a luscious thin layer with brussels lace already gracing the sides of my glass. Sweet malty nose with hints of caramel, prunes, and some winter spices, nutmeg maybe. With great anticipation I take my first quaff. Sweet with a full body and mouthfeel. She is highlighted by the typical and spectacular Belgian effervescence which always keeps their beers dancing effortlessly on my palate. Sweet malts and chewy yeasts up front with caramel and prunes rounding out my initial impression. A dry finish with a growing warmth which highlights the spices I detect, nutmeg and some cinnamon. A richly complex dubbel from Maredsous, Brussels lace continues to coat my glass as I continue to quaff her luscious brew. The further I go, the more she mellows into a fabulous blend of sweet malts versus rich bitter nuts and warm winter spices with a hint of hop bitterness in the finish.

A fantastic beer from the Maredsous and right up there with other fine dubbels I have enjoyed in the last couple years. An easy drinking anytime beer, there is no question I could sit down at anytime and enjoy a Maredsous 8 by itself or with some rich creamy cheese and crackers.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

The aroma is complex - soft fruit, dark toast, alcohol, peppery spice, tobacco, wood, and sweet malts. The flavor follows the aroma - starting bready with some residual sweetness, some dark toast melanoidins, fruity esters, and yeast. At mid-tongue, the beer dries out with yeast, subtle flowery hops, and peppery/spicey esters gaining strength. The beer finishes dry and spicy with just a hint of dark toast and residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is vigorously carbonated - very sparkley. Swishing the beer in the mouth and releasing the carbon-dioxide reveals a medium-body with a slightly oily texture.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark redish brown with a huge, foamy, off-white head that just about fully lasted and left excellent lacing. You could see the head building from the bottom as it shrank from the top. The aroma, which was nice, but weak, was moderate carmel malt, light yeast, brown sugar, a little alcohol, some bourbon and almost a liqour smell. The initial vlavor was moderately sweet, while the finish was heavily sweet and a little sour with a short duration. The dominant flavor was caramel and a slight bit of bourbon. It was also a little metallic. It was kind of like watery beer poured into whiskey.

583,"2007-01-22",4.1,"Far behind in my ratings I tasted this alongside the forgettable Blonde around 9 months ago, so luckily I took some good notes. It pours a wonderful shade of deepest ruby that shimmers in the light like a fine Merlot. The body emanates viscosity and depth, the carbonation minute and streaming in fine lines up to the 2"" crown above that held all rocky and dense, frosting over the glass as it ebbed. Rich, savoury and sweet fruits on the nose, typically forest-cake-like, a nice mellowing waft yielding some ripe berries, raisins and sultanas, figs and peppery, sherryish alcohol with just a touch of biscuity, doughy malts to make it thick. In the mouth it doesn¬ít disappoint. Rich and flavoursome, big fruity and malty palate. Nice creamy, liqueurish mix of body, the carbonation light and unhindering. Burnt bitter and savoury fruit strike at layers of chocolaty malts and a toffeeish sweetness which lies well defined upfront. Yeasty, dry woodiness and smoke hidden underneath the flavour lingers long in the aftertaste as does some more burnt fruit and phenolic, spicy alcohol which adds a nice warmth to the swallow. It is long, velvety down the back. The flavour amplifies as it warms, not one to be tasted cold. It is not the most complex of beers but the fantastic balance of flavour and aroma is undeniable.

Malty grain sweetness and fig in the aroma as well as alcohol and light spices.  The malty grains are dominant in the taste with notes of molasses and vague hints of coco.  Figgyness, as in the aroma, but it¬ís drowned out with alcohol at the end (which leaves me thinking of apple rum/brandy).  Also a light spiciness.  The mouth feel is slow and sluggish, and heavy despite ample carbonation (I burped quite a bit while drinking this one).  My wife decided that this style of beer (i.e., malty) is more her style.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

Starts a bit harsh and dry but evolves towards a pleasant fruity and slightly sour taste (red grapes, cherries) toped with some earthy spices.  Alcohol presence too much for an 8% abv and that¬ís where it loses a lot of points for me.  Not a bad beer.

(Someone please...send me a diagram of that last sentence!)   Nuts  candy sugar and dried fruits in the flavor...but at this point in the festivities, who needed flavors at all!

Generic prickly and slightly sourish foreground, mingling with a boring nutty background and burnt malt aftertaste.

583,"2004-10-02",2.9,"This beer comes in an impressive 75 cl bottle with cork and wire cage.

The colour is brown with a shade of red; the liquid is cloudy. The gigantic beige foam slowly descends into a small, almost hard ball of foam.

The smell is mild with somewhat acid notes. There are also some sour-sweet flavours of hops. There is a typical air of Belgian ale over the smell, and some alcohol in the background. Complex? Yes. 

The carbonation is quite strong, but not excessive. The small bubbles almost resembles of sparkling wine. 

The dominant taste is sweet-burned, with a lot of fruity notes. I could find some nuts and almonds, some dough (yeast) and a touch of chemicals and spices (caraway? coriander?) and blue cheese. 

The aftertaste is full of bitterness, and a surprisingly dry one too. I could perceive some tomes of fresh cucumber and metal.

The taste is very complex, and there were lots of flavours that tried to draw my attention. They worked fine together, but I found it just too much, it was more like drinking aged red wine than beer. Maredsous 8 is unquestionable a fine craft beer, but it is simply not one for me.","Link√∂ping, SWEDEN","bark"

It is lightly sweet up front, which turns into a rich fruity maltiness, and finishes with a bit of yeast driven spiciness.
