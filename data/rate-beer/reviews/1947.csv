1947,"2017-02-14",4.3,"Appearance: Nice cola-colored body with massive light brown head and a nice cascading effect.

Smell: As i was pouring, aroma was already all around. Dried fruits but the major coffee and cocoa kicks in. Smell a little like fresh-brewed coffee but more roasted than bitter. Some hops in there for good measure.

Taste: Sweet chocolate, very strong taste. Not as roasted as the smell, more on the malt side. A good hop presence near the middle to the end. Coffee in there also. Very good balance between sweet & bitter. Quite harmonious.

The finish had a nice dry intensity, there was a nice bitterness, and lastly the malts were lasting on my palate. It was a good finish but not great.

1947,"2012-05-03",4.0,"I received a 22oz bottle in a trade with a friend (thanks, Joe!). I split it with a friend. We each poured it into imperial pint glasses.

Appearance: Opaque, seemingly black body (actually very dark ruby red). Forms a very large, fluffy, tightly compacted, dark tan head which retains and laces extremely well.

Smell: Piney, resiny hops are definitely the most prominent aroma. A subtle, typical stout scent is underlying, though.

Taste: Three Floyds is a brewery known for experimenting with styles and Black Sun Stout is definitely not your average beer. Supposedly its a dry stout, but a swig or two into it makes that a little difficult to believe. Its by far the hoppiest and most bitter ""dry stout"" Ive ever encountered. Sweet black licorice up front with a fairly generic, and rather mild stout palate. It changes on a dime as all the piney hops come rushing in with a strong burst of sappy, resiny, earthiness. Whats interesting is that they fade away quickly as the beer reverts back to the opening salvo of standard stout. Theres not much in the way of roasted malts, although there is a discernible coffee-like taste, but it doesnt last long. The beer finishes fairly clean, although the hops do add up by the end. Overall, a very interesting tasting experience. Not one that blew my mind, but it did give my taste buds something to talk about.

Drinkability: While this beer may be too complex and robust to truly be considered a dry stout, it definitely has the drinkability of one. The mouthfeel is on the thinner side with a low amount of carbonation. It goes down very smooth - so smooth in fact that its easy to drink in big gulps. Not that its refreshing or as delicious as a dessert beer, just a fun, original take on an otherwise pub style brew. Three Floyds website indicates its 6.5% ABV, but that seems a little high as it has the weight of something slightly smaller. I could see the average drinker enjoying multiple servings of this without being overwhelmed or bored.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

1947,"2012-03-12",4.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/3/2011.  2011 22 oz. bottle poured into a tulip.

Black Sun Stout is a deep ebony color with a small tan head that fades to a few wispy islands after a minute, leaving no real lace.

The aroma is full of rich dark chocolate and chocolate malt, roast coffee, roasted malt, a bit of anise, and some soft spicy pine in the background.

The flavor starts with a blast of dark roasted malt, dark burnt chocolate, and roast espresso. The flavor maintains and a creamy milkiness comes in midway, before a now faded level of citrus and pine hops. The finish is somewhat sweet, with chocolate flavors dominating, but with some citrusy hops also present.

It is tough to believe that this is 5.25% ABV, as this drinks much bigger. A rich, smooth, milky, creamy mouthfeel is very impressive. Slightly sticky on the lips. The remaining hops create some salivation and a light spicy prickle on the tongue. 

Especially compared to some of the more popular beers in the style (Guinness), this drinks bigger, has a bolder flavor, and is just better overall.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Backing that up is a good amount of roasted malt, caramel, brown sugar, and a small amount of coffee. A really nice big smell for a lower abv stout.

Taste is just as good.  Its slightly dry and chewy.  The dark chocolate gives off a bit of a bitter taste.  The coffee shows up a little bit more then it did in the smell.

Bomber pours an opaque very dark brown, almost black, with a frothy and lingering tan head.  The first whiff was full of piney hops, like so many other good FFF brews.  Aroma is more what I would expect from a stout: rasted coffee, roasted malts and perhaps a bit of chocolate. Taste is almost bitter on the tongue but the long satisfying finish is malty and chocolate.  This one got even better as it warmed up.

Pours near black with a big tan-mocha head. Quite creamy and sticks around for a good period of time before falling into a nice cap and leaving some spotty lacing. The nose is pretty underwhelming with some roasted notes and a bit of coffee. The taste amps things up a bit with some stronger roast and espresso notes plus a bit of dark chocolate. Body is medium without any noticeable alcohol and has a fairly-dry finish. Pretty drinkable and one of the better versions of this style that Ive had, but nothing earth-shattering.

Nose seems to suggest some sweetness for whatever reason...some roastiness, licorice,  and some caramel.  Flavors are relaxingly mellow and smooth...certainly a lot more sweetness than one would expect in a ""dry"" stout..medium body is able to carry the flavors well...but its got a lot of caramel, licorice, and just overall malt sweetness to be labeled a dry stout.

1947,"2011-01-06",4.4,"Poured this from a 22oz bomber into a goblet glass. Pours an extremely dark brown, almost pitch black, with a 2-fingers worth of head. Eventually dissolves and leaves about a fingers worth.

On the nose, Im getting dark chocolate right away. Im also picking up some roasted malts. The hops come through on this stout. I like that. A little grapefruit in there.

The taste is a bittersweet chocolate. This is followed by a mellow coffee roastiness. A touch of grapefruit, just like the aroma. Finishes with a nice kick of hops. Just enough kick to let you know they are there. Not as ""hidden"" like in a sweeter stout but not ""in-your-face"" like an Imperial.

Medium-bodied. A little creamy but still drinkable. Had the whole bomber and it still left me wanting more!

How: Bottle 22oz.  Consumed when about 6 months of age.  Sent to me by Shawn213, thanks a lot Shawn
The look: Near black body topped by a quickly diminishing medium beige head
In long: Nose is highly roasted.  Taste of char, coal, burnt molasses, a little smoky touch, a lot of hops, mint, milk-chocolate, a cup of black coffee.  Cacao in the comeback.  The beer is very dry and quite hoppy.  Finish is a bit abrasive with the high roastiness joining a harsh resinous grassy bitterness.  The beer is very tasty for a 5% stout (which is not a bad thing) but it came through as a bit rough.  All in all it is quite good and certainly not boring, just not very classy.

Absolutely amazing smell. Very distinct hop character. Almost hard to believe that a dry stout can smell like this. Fresh hops, pine-needles and resins. The hops are mixed with a smooth roasted malt character, chocolate and a faint smoky note.

The taste is almost better than the smell. I havent had many stouts with such a fantastic and distinct hop character. Its fresh with plenty of resins and grass, and even some notes of grapefruit. Underneath the hops lies a smooth stout character. Sweet malts, dark bread and some chocolate. The stout flavors go really well with the hops, a true work of art, Id guess. A gentle tart note in the middle. The finish is rather bitter with some wood, hop resins and sweet malts.

Semi-full body, plenty or carbonation. Finishes somewhat dry.

1947,"2009-11-21",3.3,"22 oz bottle. Pours super dark brown with a bubbly tan head that fizzes out to nothing rather quickly. Aroma is dark roasted grains, boozy vanilla and a light smoky wood scent. The flavor is very bitter coffee roast with some light sweet chocolate flavors. Medium to full body with a lively carbonation and a chalky dry finish. This is good but Im thinking this is an old bottle or possible slightly infected due to the short lived head, strange mouth feel and the somewhat acidic bite.

Not much hop spice, but a nice sweet, chocolatey flavor. Pours black with just a little head, going away really quickly.  Has that trademark Three Floyds flavor - which is comforting.

Way the label is right: ""Its not normal"" - I completely agree!  Bordering on black as you pour, definitely black at the bottom of the bottle.  Faint ruby edges held up to the light, with a big bumpy tan head.  So far, its normal...then I took a whiff!  Who put hops in my stout?  There are a ton of hops in this beer, and they share the aroma spotlight with smoky malt and a bit of cocoa.  Flavor is also boldly hoppy up front, fading through light coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, vanilla, and more of that smoky malt.

Its next to black in the glass, and topped by a small, good-looking tan head.

Having received this in a trade earlier in the year I was eager to finally give it a try.  Id passed it on the shelves so many times that Three Floyds pulled out of both Wisconsin and Ohio.  If Id known what I was missing I would have grabbed at least a single bottle to try along with Gumbalhead.  This is a decent stout in the style of Guinness but given the choice I would buy local (Midwestern).  Theres a reason it is near the top of its category.

Aroma / Appearance - The fading head actually consumes some of the liquid as it cascades downwards.  Transparent at the edges the body becomes dark and mysterious by the bottom.  A little hoppy it nonetheless has the stout aspects I expected to find including coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts.  The hoppy aspect reminds me of ivy which has just been trimmed off a tree where it was not wanted.

Flavor / Palate - The fluid mixture that clears the palate includes fresh chocolate, ash, coffee, and woody mulch.  Finishing with a dry smoky aspect it sits deftly between the tongue and throat.  Very mellow and sessionable I would recommend this to anyone looking to get their feet wet with what a stout should be.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1947,"2009-03-27",3.7,"Black in colour with a quickly dissipating tan head, light lacing.  The aroma is quite sweet, is very roasty, lots of oatmeal and quite malty.  The flavour has incredible amounts of oatmeal, rather sweet, creamy with lots of roast, light alcohol and chocolate malts.  Roasty mouthfeel, medium/large body, medium/high carbonation.  Finishes long, creamy and roasty.
This is very filling considering the amount of oatmeal that I got out of this, roasty and chocolaty.  At times this got a bit harsh.

Caramel and more bitter coffee comes forth with a nice sort of subdued dark fruits that stay in the background. Very dry in the aftertaste and coffee like bitterness.

1947,"2009-03-10",3.9,"3/10/2009:  My general impression of Three Floyds beers are that they are good, but over-priced (at least the bottle is FULL).  However, that having been said, I now see why I still buy a bottle of their beer every now and then.  They are rich and full of flavor.  They also dont hold back on those glorious, flavorful hops!  Black Sun Stout is no exception.  Its aroma is super hoppy; lots of FRESH pine and floral hops.  Underneath that green, fresh, lively hoppiness is a rich, chocoate maltiness.  The flavor is very similar.  The super fresh and substaintial hop flavor gives way to a moderately bitter-sweet roasted maltiness with significat hints of chocolate and coffee.  Delicate threads of citrusy orange hops and candy-like flavors can also be found in the mid-palate.  The finish is just a touch dry and the roasted coffee with some char flavor draws me back in for drink after drink.  All of this beer flavor and aroma goodness is presented in a nearly black, smooth, medium-full bodied liquid that has a frothy beige to tan-colored head.  This is a really nicely done stout.  Maybe my real problem with 3F is that the beer just disappears too quickly since its quite good leaving me $10+ lighter in the wallet much faster than I would have liked to be!

1947,"2009-03-02",4.2,"22oz bottle. Pours a jet black body with a fizzy, dark brown, quickly dissipating head that leaves an oily and runny lace. Aroma is very hoppy for the style, which is surprising except for the fact that this is a FFF beer, which doesnt surprise me one bit. Lots of the typical floral hops from FFF as well as a juicy citrus. Moderate amount of roasted dry coffee grounds, some ripe cherries, and a woody backing. Lots of sweet caramels and bittersweet chocolate. Flavor is very similar and right on track with the aroma. Roasted coffee and floral hops dominate from beginning to end. Quite sweet up front with the mellow dark chocolate and vast amount of caramel malts. Finishes very dry and woody with a touch of citrus. Lingers for quite a long time.

1947,"2009-02-28",3.5,"Bomber shared with soccer290. As always, I was extremely excited to have a different brew from FFF. This beer poured a dark black color with mahogany tints around the edges and was accompanied by a one finger width tan head. The aroma really got me excited... there was a lot of dark dried fruit accents with a lot of roasted malts and some bitter chocolate. The taste was good but was very typical for a stout. There was bitter chocolate hints with some coffee, dried fruits, and nutty malts. This stout had a fairly light mouthfeel which was disappointing in my opinion. Finished bitter with some metallic hints. Overall a good stout but nothing to get too excited about.","Streator, Illinois, USA","General66"

After an initial whiff i find it hard to believe that this actually a stout since there is such a significant hop profile in the aroma, which definitely peaks my interest immediately, so i have to give some extra points for that alone.  Notes of highly floral hops, sweet fruits, and good amount of dry roasted coffee malts.  This is a very attractive stout as well, with a small layer of cappuccino cream head, and medium looking 
dark mahogany color.  A very appealing looking and smelling beer.  The taste fits nicely into how i  expected it based on the smell.  Lots of roasted malts, including coffee, nuts, and minor sweet caramel, come through from the start and stay strong through out.  Of course what makes this one a very unique and highly enjoyable beer is the 3fs floral hop bitterness that completely add to the experience of a traditionally malty alcoholic beverage.

It is a very dark brown, not quite black. There was little to no head, with a little lacing. It has great clarity, but looks a little thin. Note- I dont really care that much about appearance.
Aroma- friggin awesome. I know this sounds really corny, but it reminded me of a forest in the rain. It was a fresh aroma, woody with vanilla in front; roast malt in the back. I smelled this beer for awhile.
Taste- Really nice balance between aroma hops and malt, with a hop bite at the end. Not too hoppy at all. Vanilla was still there, with lots of roasted barley.
Mouthfeel, the beer was lighter in body, which made it easy to drink.

Lots of hops, chocolate, and some burnt cardboard notes. The initial flavours are rather interestin as well, because some werent noticeable in the aroma. All kinds of citrus is apparent, from darker citrus, to a little pineapple, apple, and kiwi. Hops make a big appearance with the citrus. Some roasted notes start to creep through along with a slight bitterness. Towards the finish, chocolate becomes more apparent. The roasted notes bursts, complementing the chocolate quite well. Citrus becomes overwhelmed by the other flavours, but is still noticeable towards the end. Apple seems to be the flavour that becomes more apparent than the rest.

The nose is as hoppy as a stout can possibly be, with crushing pine and spruce notes dominating what seems to be a roasty, chocolate and coffee background.  The flavor is just as hoppy, with pine resin overpowering the malty elements.  Bakers chocolate and espresso come through in the background, but serve more as afterthoughts to the intense bitterness.  The mouthfeel is substantial, but very dry and overly carbonated.

Very interesting aroma for a stout - some of the familiar notes are there in the form of chocolate and subtle dark fruits, but these are covered up by a peppery hop aroma. The flavor is starts bitter-sweet with some nice coffee and dark chocolate notes, and finishes nicely bitter and dry with the spicy hops taking over (although I must say that there is a lingering milk chocolate sweetness on the tongue once the hops have faded). The mouthfeel is a little pit prickly for a stout, but works given the dry spicy flavors of the brew.

1947,"2008-02-29",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 11, 2009 Bomber courtesy of tjthresh. This is a very cool looking bottle, probably my favorite label for a 3F brew. It pours black with a dense, creamy, tan head. Picture perfect. The nose is an interesting and fairly enticing blend of: coffee, roast malt, piny hops, bing cherries and faint chocolate. Light to medium-bodied and fairly aqueous, it transitions to a lightly dry and mildly bitter finish. It is a bit thinner than Id expected, but it is supremely quaffable. Sweet, dark roast and coffee are followed quickly by floral and lightly piny hops and notes of caramel, cherries and light chocolate, very much like the nose. Quite nice and beautifully balanced. This is easily my favorite dry stout and one of the most flavorful and drinkable stouts that I have tried. It combines the thinner quaffability of Guinness with the flavor of a 3F brew.

Recieved this in a trade from my RB Secret Santa, thanks Melvin. An aggressive pour brought about a fingers worth of tan creamy head that settled to a thick crown. Black body with no light coming throuhg at any point. Leaves patchy lacing here and there. 

Although the aroma is fairly simple its no less appetizing. Theres a light roastiness with a mild nuttiness and mild lactic creaminess. Theres also some dark fruit, as it warms, adding a sweetness that compliments the roastiness nicely. There a hint of the nuttiness throught but its faint. 

Black Sun is medium bodied with a slightly prickly carbonation which at certain times feels a little too prickly. 

This is a beer I could enjoy all night. Big flavor from a more standard abv stout. The abv really helps the drinkability. 

Another good beer from Three Floyds. Ive always passed this beer up because the pricetag is pretty hefty considering the abv. Im glad I got to give it a shot. Although the price tag is high I would pick a bottle of this up occasionally.

This is a solid stout from Three Floyds. The aroma translates pretty well into the flavor. Light roastiness is the canvas with a splash of lactic creaminess here and dark fruit there. The dark fruit shows up on the backend.

1947,"2007-08-22",3.5,"My third bomber of Black Sun, as far as I can recall, and Im still not feeling it as much as most raters. Im a fan of the brewery and the style, but I feel that this one - while very solid and generally above average - sort of falls short of the mark. First, theres a trace of oxidation. While I was looking for that lovely, gentle roast that you get in the best dry stouts, I found something too close to a thinly hopped bitterness. Not bad, but not what I want. Second, since the brew moves away from classic dry stout qualities, its also surprisingly thin in the body, with an insubstantial presence that undercuts the malt presence. Like I said, its a solid brew but I find it short of expectations.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Sweet malty aroma with impy notes (chocolate and roast levels are that high) leaning toward milk chocolate, with surprising hoppiness.  Opaque motor oil pour with a foamy dark brown head.  Initial taste is strong sourness, soon overtaken by stronger bittersweet roast coffee.  Chocolate creeps in but stays behind that salty roast. Rather light-bodied, very drinkable.  Slight hop tingle begins on the tip of the tongue and lasts into the throat.  Dryish, bitterish, slightly sourish finish with milk chocolate and medium-strength grapefruit tones lingering in the aftertaste.  The hops make it a stylish brew, and the grapefruit notes really do harmonize.

Light sweetness and light astringency coupled with bold roastiness gently subdue much of the hops; balance at this velocity of flavor seems unlikely though.

The aroma is sweet and fruity with a definite medicinal flourish.  I guess 5% is relatively high for a stout, but on the first swallow I might guess this to be a higher gravity brew.  This drinks with a strong java roastiness but theres also a ethylene viscosity, while not as robust as a Baltic Porter, at least reminded me of one.  This is delicious, if not a bit thin for the body in the flavor.  (#2684, 2/4/2007)","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"

Taste is a pleasant, almost creamy mix of chocolates, coffee, and dark roasted grains.  Hop flavor is very prominent - almost at the level of a Victory Storm King.  As with other 3Fs beers, they really push the boundaries of a style by adding a little extra - namely hop flavor - to styles not known for hoppiness (Gumballhead as a Wheat and Robert the Bruce as a Scottish Ale come to mind).

Smell is roasted malt and hops. Im not a hop-head and prefer my stouts on the non-hoppy side, but the nitro tap takes care of most of this. This beer is so creamy and smooth, its very, very good. Very good dark choco taste with a perfect amount of hops coming through in the taste. This is a very solid offering from FFF.

1947,"2006-10-26",4.2,"Bottle. Pours very dark opaque ruby with a nice tan head. Now, as Im looking at this brew in my large glass here is the curiosity on my mind: what do I expect? I mean, Three Floyds is so unpredictable. Most of their brews are quirky, yet some of them are faithful representations of a particular style. For some reason Im thinking this is going to be a solidly executed, textbook dry stout. Nope. A sniff brings that signature Floyd hop assault to my nose. I grin with satisfaction. Amid the defined, rounded, zesty pine are notes of soy sauce, chocolate, walnuts. The flavor has a very good Irish stout character. Its drying in the finish, plenty of coffee to be found. A hint of meaty notes is detected. This could stand on its own as a solid dry stout, but Three Floyds deemed it necessary to hop the shit out of it. Well, my hat off to them for chosing to do that. It comes across like a charred forest with embers glowing in the damp earth. . .with coffee. Theyve created a solid, tasty, and simultaneously unique beverage. The finish brings out coconuts and more floral aspects which battle with a wash of creamy, drying bittersweetness.  Its not normal.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Aroma?  Oh hell yes, what a smell too.  Who would have thought this blackness would smell so strongly of fresh pungent and funky hops?  Anyway, aroma is hoppy, with a planty vegetable quality rather than any pine or citrus quality; also with some caramel and mocha/coffee tones.  Do I smell something vaguely cheesy too?  I think so.  Aroma is still detectable right after tasting too.  Flavor is chocolaty, with some burnt coffee tastes, and a slight acidity.  Hop flavor compliments the coffee pretty well.  Finishes caramelly, followed by roast, and some of that hop flavor that I detected in the aroma.  Hints of cigar smoke in the finish too.  Pretty thick for a regular stout, low carbonation.

Sweet oily aroma of orange oils, pine tar, blackened stuff, and slight peppery spice.

Taste is round, big, and bold with a big jump of flavor on the buds with charred roasted malt tone mixed, almost balanced, but not quite, with a orangey pine oil. Slimming bite and bitterness. Semi tangy, mostly charred-like, peppy, lip smacking, smokey dryness really sticks it right on the palate and doesnt move from there. Finish is a mix of complex notions with blackened, charred, smokey, ashy things with a sliver of coffee and oily wood and orange.

Feel is sooo nice...quite big and everlasting in body. Richly set in lasting and well rounded big roasty/charred malts and tone with a semi plush tang underneath it. The hops really make for a unique experience as they add both an extra dimension of flavor and finish within the tone of charred malts. Theres an oily side to it that stays just to the back and around the sides, letting the blackened stuff stay up front and heavy on the tongue. Complex as hell; I tell ya what...

An exceptional stout. A mind over matter...of drinking the hell out of the bomber type of brew that exhumes itself from the depths of obscured stout sessioning. What the hell Im I talking about?

The taste was very smoky with the coffee, toffee, and chocolate flavors being most prominent, followed by dense and citric hop bitterness.

Appearance is something of a let down- thin thin head atop a watery looking black body. Flavor is hard to pin down- it starts off like Alpha King mixed with a normal stout... not so tasty. As it warms, the stout character comes out a bit more, but the hops still stay there in the finish. This creates a sort of skanky taste. Finally, this is possibly the lightest bodied stout Ive ever had from a Microbrewery. Not 3Fs best beer... but that didnt stop them from charging $11 for a bomber.","minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","IPAndy"

Taste transfers over. Yummy yum yum. Big warm hops welcome you in, very dry, backed up by almost-as-strong dry, roasted bitter stout malts.

Caramel, chocolate and vanilla. The thin to medium body is well carbonated and the mouthfeel is juicier than other dry stouts I have had. Clean throughout with a lingering taste of citrus. Heck, if dAchouffe can throw citrusy hops at a tripel, why cant 3F hop up a dry stout? The combination of IPA and tripel works better for me.

1947,"2006-04-03",4.8,"For my 500th rating I celebrated by journeying to Dayton to visit Belmont Party supply.  I
had to go there to secure a special brew to commemorate the landmark rating:  Three
Floyds Black Sun Stout.  To be perfectly honest, I originally wanted to rate the Dark Lord
for my 500th, but since they didnt have it, the Black Sun would have to be substituted.  I
guess Ill have to reserve the Dark Lord for rating 666.  Im proud to say that not only did
I leave the store with the Black Sun, but I liberated an additional 85 bottles, and a growler
to be sampled at a later time.  OK back to the Black Sun.  As usual from this master
brewer, the spicy nose is heavy on grapefruit; just the way I like it.  In addition, notes of
flowers and brown sugar abound.  Usually when rating, we speak of a brews complexity
as it relates to taste.  This brew might have the most complex nose Ive encountered to
date.  The brew pours black.  The sweet casual cascade meanders slowly into a fluffy
rocky brown head that leaves hunks of lace on my glass.  The retention is fair.  Espresso,
lots and lots of espresso.  The brew has a roasted, acidic and mighty mighty bitter taste
with tons of character - then again, what else would you expect from the Floyds Three?

A little surprised about the hop aroma but it blends together nicely.  Flavor starts off sweet with roasted malts, chocolate and a hint of coffee.  Finishes with hops that blend well with the sweet, malty flavor.  Taste lingers for a while but the sweet, roasted malts compliment  the hops better then I expected.

Aspects of coffee, burnt fruits, and caramel with an astringent burnt finish.  Mouthfeel is pretty full-bodied for a Dry Stout, with an oily texture.  Carbonation is a little fizzy but not to excess.  A nice take on a usually boring and unimpressive style.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Aroma of piney hops, roasted malts, a hint of ash, anise, and light toffee.  Flavor is piney and roasty up front with moderate piney sweetness and caramel sweetness (the hops and malts meld thatwell).  Roasty ashy bitter finish.    Carbonation is almost nil, though the body is still smooth.  I could drink quite a bit of this stuff, though its too damn expensive--my problem with most 3F brews--though this isnt strong enough to warrant the high price tag like their other brews.  Old rating follows.22oz. bomber, no date.  Pours a dark brown with a mod-sized tan head.  Aroma of 3Fs hops, consisting of pine and grapefruit and grass--not that thats a bad thing.  Can also pick up some coffee and bitter chocolate.  Seems to be almost too hoppy for a stout--not true to style, but still good.  The hops pretty take over the whole taste until the finish, which is dry, as expected.

Deep black body in my shaker glass, with a half inch of brown foam the dwindles to a ring of lace. Now theres a roasty coffee aroma, with a bit of cocoa.

1947,"2006-03-13",3.3,"Ok, so can 3F make a beer that isnt loaded with beautiful citrusy hops?  I mean come on, this stout pours deep brown with a mocha head and screams stout from the get go.  I give the glass a slight swirl and the hops just punch you in the nose.  Orange, grapefuit, mango are combined with lesser notes of grass and lemon.  The strong hop presence actually makes that nice malt profile hard to notice in the aroma.  The hops continue in the body, almost acting out of balance with the nice, roasty profile.   More citrus, more perfume and more floral notes cover the nice mocha body.  Maybe some time would help mellow this, but as is it seems out of whack for me.  Of course, I love 3F hops, so I cant rate this too low.  Give me Alpha Klaus everyday and thrice on Sunday over this.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

The body is thinner than I expected, a bit disappointing, but the flavour makes up for it - a great combination of coffee, hops, roast malt and smoke. Mmmmm.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
1947,"2006-03-13",3.3,"Light beige head covers the very deep brown colored body. Strong malt-strangling hops come across very piney, green, foresty and playing around the chocolate powdered malts. Hop focused Three Floyds without the greatness of Alpha Klaus, but packing as much dry-hopping as legitimacy allows in a really drinkable, low-gravity stout. Miraculously avoids astringency. Supporting malt is supple, not really flavour contributing at all besides the roastiness, but at least keeping things in order and perspective. Obviously not designed for me, but doing what Three Floyds are renowned for and as clean as it gets. Do you like American hops or not?","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1947,"2006-03-13",3.6,"Any first impressions?
-A faint ring haloes the opaque blackness.
-Intricate roastiness and silky vanilla zigzag around the portentous citrusy hoppiness.
-Multifarious citrusy hops blend admirably with the chocolatey sweetness and roasty firmness.
-A luscious mouthfeel for the style remains drinkable while exposing its malty wealth.

What if you dig deeper?
-Finishes with a calculated dose of malt roastiness and hop bitterness.
-The dark chocolate continues into the finish to make sure youre not taken advantage of.
-Very intense, but somehow near equilibrium in that intensity; there is enough malt to back up all the hops.
-Stunningly cohesive and very flavorful, while never going overboard. Another 3Floyds success in my book.

1947,"2006-03-12",3.9,"Thanks to JPDIPSO for trading. Pitch black. Modest, creamy, khaki carbonation. Smells like poison. Burnt licorice and grapefruit, roasty malt, and a touch of smoke. Flavors are big, resinous, citrus hops up front followed by bittersweet chocolate and licorice and burnt malt. Everything crams together for one hell of an aftertaste. Medium body, just to the smoother side of balanced. Oily afterpalate. One of the hoppiest dark brews Ive had, well done.","Florida, USA","SoLan"

1947,"2006-03-10",4.1,"Is this a rich, dark, malt-laden IPA... or is this a stout for hopheads? Call it what you will, the hop/malt ratio is definitely off-kilter for a ""dry stout"". So, refrain from ""rating to style"" and enjoy this for what it is... whatever it is.
Pours black with blood-red highlights. A creamy, tan head settles slowly and laces nicely before resting in an oily film. Aroma finds an immediate onslaught of pine, which is eventually found to cover deep, roasted coffee, an undertow of chocolate syrup and a chemical-dash of ""new car smell"". A buttery/savory palate makes my mouth water while it discovers the flavors of Hersheys Special Dark Chocolate complemented with twangy citrus notes. Sweetness and piney hops intensify independently as the beer warms and make me wish I would have shared the bomber as the last ounces are hard to swallow.What this is, I decide, is simply another tasty, hopped-up offering from the notorious Brothers Floyd. With the intense hop signature they apply to virtually every beer, some have called them a ""one trick pony"". That may be, but if you like the pony, youll keep riding it. Or... insert a better analogy about ponies.

Pretty near impenetrable blackness in the glass, topped by a slow-fading moderate dark tan head leaving faint lacing....dark chocolate and coffee not surprisingly dominate the nose, but a pungent hoppiness is present in spades as well....overall, its not terribly overt, surprising from this brewer....lightly sweet front, lots of dry roasted malts throughout, burnt brown sugar barely softens the strong bitterness equally contributed by the roast espresso and woody hoppiness....some sharp, pine-needle character towards the finish and a touch of acrid smoke and shy dry herbs (tarragon, thyme)....quite full body, carbonation level a bit high.

Aroma - holy *&$%, hops!  Lush, almost overwhelming resiny hops, roastiness and chocolate begin to compete as it warms, but its mostly about the hops; maybe this isnt balanced but its awesome.  Taste of deep roast coffee, chocolate, and waves of funky resiny hops, almost sweet they were so pungen - like fresh-crushed mint leaves.  This had a long, bitter, slightly grassy finish, with a bitter, flat mouthfeel and a slightly thin body - The consensus was we all really liked it, but the body left it a little short of an outstanding dry stout - and unique in our experience.

Clean crisp citrus hop bitterness goes great with the bitterness that emerges from the coffee flavors.  The finish is shared by a nice dryness and a citric hop bitterness.  Unique stout.

1947,"2006-01-01",3.7,"2005 bomber from Rooftoprogue, drunk on 12/31/05.  Pours a dark brownish-black, transluscent-to-transparent, with tan edges and an initially large tan head.  Begins like a typical dry stout, appearance-wise, but the head, while it never diminishes completely, does recede rather quickly to cover with no lacing.  Would like to have seen better head retention, especially on a dry stout, but hey, thats the price you pay for fake carbonation and filtration.  The aroma is bursting with fuzzy hops.  Green, mossy, quite floral and just really interesting.  Almost like an herbal-spiciness with touches of conifer in the background.  I didnt get any smoke out of the nose, but there is a light espresso, salty roast and hint of vanilla creaminess.  The hops are really aromatic, rather dominating the nose, but hey, at least its a dry stout you can smell!  The flavor begins with an equal burst of fuzzy, green, leafy hops, quite flavorful and dry, with some minty-pine notes, hickory nuts and notes of orange zest.  Behind the hops is a distinct coffee note, that is nowhere near overdone and adds bits of vanilla and creamy malt.  The hops recede and leave in place a brace of caramel malt sweetness, ending on a roasted bitterness, well-controlled and lacking any acrid/acidic notes.  With continued drinking and warming, the hops remain strong in the flavor, never too bitter, with more chocolate and a light playfulness of cherries and dates, though overshadowed greatly by the vanilla and coffee notes.  Everything seems well-placed, with the ingredients being easily identified and staggered for effect.  The texture is lightly creamy, the malts soft on the palate, and the carbonation, while a bit prickly at times, does not seem to disrupt the body significantly.  The sweetness is certainly there, not in force, but I dont find the body thin or lacking.  A unique interpretation of the style (would not expect anything less from 3Fs), carefully constructed with no alcohol apparency.  Thanks so much Rob!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Opaque ebony color with a fine, slight head and sparse lacing.  Flavor profile features an influx of spicy hop flavor up front, more fresh pine and earth overlaying the dark, roasty malt foundation which does indeed provide a dry, rather short finish and featuring a lingering blend of cocoa bean and hop flavor.  Bitterness is light-medium, as is the body.  Mouthfeel is is effervescent and perhaps just a tad thin.

The nose on this is super hoppy, if I was blind I would think it to be an IPA! Lot of pine resin and grapefruit (similar to that of Alpha Klaus but more pronounced), light roasted coffee and chocolate esters, and a hit of black patent malt. The taste is not has hoppy as the aroma thank goodness but you can still get some piney and citric qualities towards the finish. The forefront is more towards burnt and sweet malts with a espresso like bitter undertone and even a hint of walnut. The feel is lively and quite smooth with the exception of a metallic astrengent and dry finish. Quite drinkable really, it will be much like Alpha Klaus and Gumballhead for me, when I seek something in a style that is more towards a hoppy than malty or wheaty character. It will be interesting to see how much the hop nature mellows over time.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

A good but not great stout.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drainey"

Aroma smells like a cross between plastic, burning rubber and vinyl. Normally Id be worried, but the last beer I had that had that aroma was Gonzo Imperial Porter and I loved that. Deep black with a huge two finger thick mocha head. Fore is dominated by intense hops. I dont know what kind of hops they used, but it has an almost plastic-like flavor. Very roasty in the middle with some chocolate notes, but the hops carry allt he way through to the finish. A Year ago I would have thought this was way too hoppy, but it works well in this beer....though I will say i wish i could taste a little bit more of the malt base...its hard when the hops linger so long through all the flavor ranges.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"
1947,"2005-12-28",2.8,"Draft - odd aroma for a stout.  Next to nothing but grassy hops.  Nearly black body with a medium brown head.  The hops fight with the chocolate/coffee malt.  Far from my favorite.","New Albany, Indiana, USA","smoosh"
1947,"2005-12-28",3.5,"Black Suns brownish black color and dark tan head could stand up to most imperial stouts in terms of darkness. Its nose is mostly citric American hops w/ a chocolate roast character not far in the background. As per their description this is somewhat light bodied yet still quite full flavored and not all watery. Mild carbonation w/ a crisp astringent bite from the roasted grains backed up by a lingering hoppy bitterness in the finish.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
1947,"2005-12-25",3.4,"heemer brought this bomber to the 2005 Christmas gatering at hey_kevins.  a black motor oil pour with strong hoppy aroma.  flavor was rather harsh with dark roasted malt, slightly burnt coffee and piney hops.  not what I was expecting, some age might help this one but I doubt it.","Quad-Cities, Illinois, USA","barleyPops"
1947,"2005-12-25",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2006 Rerate from a bottle.  Even better.  The aromas and flavors are much better balanced.  3F should get rid of the nitro in the brewpub.

Nitro pour in Dec 2005.  Black as black can be with a brown nitro head.  Huge hop aroma.  Grass and citrus.  Would be better if some or the roast came through.  You can get a light dry roasted character, but the hops are the showcase.  Piney, grassy.  A touch sweet up front with a nice dry finish.  Light body, very smooth due to the nitro.  Id say this is basicly a typical Irish stout with amped up hops.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
1947,"2005-12-24",3.4,"from a 22 oz. bottle thanks to heemer77.  sampled at hey_kevins christmas gathering.  Dark opaque pour with a dark tan head that stuck around the edge.  Piney aroma, as well as coffee, and some dark, earthy smells.  Taste was mainly coffee, with some caramel and nuts too.  The hoppy finish was harsh though.  This needs some more balance and it would be better.  Thanks Eric","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","Illini08"
1947,"2005-12-24",2.4,"Bomber. Blackish with some tan head, somewhat transparent. Why oh why must they filter and force carbonate? Nose is pure American Cascades and alcohol along with some scant mocha. Flavor is strange. The cascades are defintely a different touch, but dont really mesh well with the minimal malts in this one. Very dry. And why is the alcohol so dominant in this one? Is it really only 5.25% ABV, if so, that is not good. Needs balance.","Detroit, Michigan, USA","JoshuaB"
1947,"2005-12-24",2.7,"22oz bomber from JoshuaB. Pours a thin black with a ligh tan head. Nose is light chocolate and alcohol, some mild toffee notes. Taste is thin, watery, light chocolate, more alcohol, a dry bitter off sensation. This just didnt sit well with me, but I cant put my finger on this feature that just made the beer not good. It had kind of a bland, watered down and just not fitting taste.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","SuIIy"
1947,"2005-12-23",3.8,"From the bottling in late 2005. This poured with a black body topped by a peach and orange colored head. The aroma was grassy with pine and coffee. It is obviously another hopped up 3Fs brew. The mouthfeel was smooth and slick. The taste had coffee and bitter dark chocolate. There was also some tobacco. Nicely done and interesting, but certainly not close to style.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
1947,"2005-12-21",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 22, 2005 Poured an opaque black color with a medium sized, tan head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of dry roasted malts, vanilla, some smoke, pine, grass, and citrus fruits.  Smoke, hazelnuts, chocolate, and roasted malt in the taste, bitter hoppy finish.  Dry finish, but thin mouthfeel.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
1947,"2005-12-21",3.9,"On tap at the brewery. Black with big long lasting brown tan frothy head. Nose is full and sweet with alcohol, fructose and maybe just a dab of ketones which is probably the hops that is pretty present. Roasted malts alcohol cheries and cofee grounds in the taste. THere is a bit of cream here and there. Overall I liked this one a lot.","Saint Louis, Missouri, USA","SubstanceT"
1947,"2005-12-21",3.1,"Deep, intense black with a moderately fluffy tan head.  A hoppy nose reminiscent of Alpha Klaus.  Piney, resinous aroma walft out of the glass with underlying notes of caramel, cocoa, nuts, roasted coffee and some burnt toast elements.  The body is pretty thick and full, with mild carbonation proffering little prickling sensations on the tongue.  The flavor shows the fairly unique profile shown by Three Floyds.  The combination of fairly roasted malt with ultra bitter hops.  While I do enjoy the combination of flavors here, Im getting confused on the variation from other beers.  This could honestly be labled Alpha Klaus and I would believe it.  Almost, if not exactly, the same.  Good flavor, but boring in its lack of originality...","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
1947,"2005-12-20",3.2,"Lots of roasted coffee with some apricot hops.  Very much like alpha klaus.  Dark, dark black with a thin, brown head.

I didnt like the combination of dryness and hops.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"
1947,"2005-12-20",3.5,"Milwaukee YEHa!05, brought by DavidP and 1FastSTi.  Dark brown body, light brown/tan head.  Huge Three Floyds ""house"" hops aroma- big pines and medicinal notes, with chocolate (overpowered by hops) in the background.  Really, a dead-ringer for Alpha Klaus.  But the flavor was quite different than the former beer, with licorice, toast, and chocolate leaving a sweet candy-like feel on the palate before, BAM!  The huge piney, medicinal hops slam the door on the palate and close out the beer on a bitter note.  The fruity aspect, almost reminiscent of cherry cordials or chocolate wafers, is unique.  Strange.  I cant really figure it out, but I liked this.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
1947,"2005-12-20",3.6,"Bottle @ Milwaukee YeHa. Silky black body with a taller tan head. Aromas jump from the glass with fresh hops and a hint of roasted malt. Think Alpha Klaus, with a drier, chalkier character. A hoppy stout for sure.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

Dry and sweet, the flavor is restrained, yet emphasized by the Guiness like stout charachteristics. A very interesting take on a dry stout.","Mississippi, USA","Mangino"
1947,"2005-12-17",3.8,"Bottle... Pitch black ale with a small, creamy, light brown head. Very good retention. The nose delivers strong notes of chocolate and pine needles with lesser notes of caramel and vanilla.  The flavor is medium bitter and burnt. No residual sweetness... cocoa powder, coffee grounds and a pinch of salt. Light to medium-bodied with an astringent mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Finishes burnt, bitter then bone dry.

1947,"2005-12-17",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 17, 2008 I say WAY back that Id rerate this from the bottle, since my original rating was based on the muted nitro version that they always serve at the 3F brewpub.  The bottle version is very nice, allowing an aroma of resinous pine and some citric notes to shine through.  The flavor is also much more alive with a fresh hoppy bitterness.  Way better bottles... or probably draft, too, if they every drop the nitro crap.Original Rating 12/17/2005 - 7/3/6/3/15 - 3.4-------- />
Nitro at the FFF Pub:  I suspect my ratings will go up with the bottle that Ill pop later, cause nitroed beers are muted in aroma and taste.  Quite creamy to drink.  Heavily roasted malts and a solid floral/herbal hopping make for a good combination, but it tames the character of the brew when it nitros out of the spout.  Somewhat smokey, highly malted - its good, for sure.  But tamed.  Ill rerate on my bottle.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?

Dry and creamy.  The aroma is very hoppy with tons of PNW hops.  Also, dry and malty roastedness.  The flavor makes me think they took a Guinness and dry hopped the shit out of it.

1947,"2005-12-12",4.0,"Nitro at the brew pub (with a forthcoming review of the bottled version - sit tight.)  Opaque and black in the imperial pint with a booming, dense and creamy khaki looking head that recedes to blanketing vellum lacing.  Black licorice and burnt espresso grinds paint the aromatic picture of a big roasty stout, with ample contributions from black currant, pepper, burnt rubber and oil streaks.  Some accentuations from Good & Plenty candy pieces as well.  ""Roasted"" is one way to say it; ""singed"" and ""burnt"" would be a more accurate descriptor, and, here, that gets you points in my book.  Iced coffee bitterness sinks into the taste buds, taking on a parallel flavor persona to one of those bottled frappuccinos sold in the supermarket.  Bitter, dark chocolate shavings melded to melted cappuccino ice cream.  Creamy and smooth character transitions to a prickly and lively (bitter) outtake with black jellybeans encapsulating the palates domain.  Nitro might rob some of the boisterous sentiments that I expect to find in the bottle version, and we all know theres one sure fire way to find that out.  Dense, chocolate brownies sprinkled with French roast coffee grinds takes us from flavor to finish.  Another admirable, style leading rendition by one of the worlds best.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
