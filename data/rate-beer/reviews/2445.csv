Sampled on June 17, 2017.Clear golden to amber color, thick very slow beautiful legs. Sweet, apple, warm, wood, alcohol scent. Sweet, apple, some raisin like, wood taste. Intense sweet apple aftertaste. Warming alcohol. Full smooth lovely mouthfeel. Some less alcohol toch in scent and it would be a full 5.0 total for me I guess. Lovely lovely stuff, if not for the price I could really see myself getting plenty more bottles of this!Rather sweet indeed though, so for the not so much sweet lovers could be too sweet perhaps?","Mölndal, SWEDEN","gnoff"

2445,"2017-04-19",4.0,"Enormous thanks Viktor for the two-sip-dip bottle! Lovely viscous dark golden body. The aroma jumps around indecisively but interesting between fresh and fermented green apples, before throwing some coconut around and finally showing the boozy barrel touches, some raw alcohol, vaguely pukey touches. Its all over the place, not always pleasant, but lovely when it is. The taste is a surprise then, the chewy appley tartness kicks in and is mellowed by a background sweetness that melds seamlessly with it. Its kinda like one of those sweet chewing gums that have a sour filling that kids ""tricked"" other people with for the most part. And then the lovely, ""noble"" dryish apple taste bursts forwards. Clean, clean, clean. The alcohol is very, very hidden in the taste, showing on the tongue for a second in the finish. This is the single most tart ice cider Ive had, but its no less tasty. Woody tannins show up in the aftertaste, otherwise a quick fight to the death between the tart, dry and sweet appley notes. A fascinating beverage, unique among the ones Ive had so far.","Split / Zagreb, CROATIA","Marko"
