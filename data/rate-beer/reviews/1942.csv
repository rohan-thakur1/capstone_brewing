1942,"2014-10-25",3.0,"I get the hype but dont buy it. This is all barrel, and I know threat pappy van winkle is good whiskey. But this is beer, and a stout, and should taste like one first and foremost. Tastes like whiskey dregs. Classic example of hype over substance. People seem to be rating this for the whiskey, not for the beer. Light bitter finish and some roast, but sense of stout is faint. Bottle pour at Churchkeys fifth anniversary.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"
1942,"2014-09-18",4.3,"""split a bottle of this rarity after passing on my own bottle at $16 per 375. Not that it isnt worthy, but Portlan beckons, and I dont have the coin to do more than $1 per ounce very often. Anyway, reminiscnt of the Ola Dubh series in look and feel especially. Black, a little thin, but smooth as silk. The aroma is wood, smoke, roast, bourbon, with only slight hints of chocolate and vanilla. Flavor much the same, and on the back of the smooth feel it rolls off the tongue. Very nice!""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

1942,"2014-05-02",4.1,"bottle via trade. poured into snifter. Aroma of strong vanilla and oak, almost dreamy. not very boozy on the whiffer, but a ton of just good alcohol character. Taste is smooth and silky with what seems like a ton of rye character. Dont think Pappy has rye in it, but this has that smooth pepper character than reminds me of the finer rye whiskeys. this is quite the pleasant beer.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"

The palate is nice and follows the nose nicely. This beer really need a couple minutes to open up from the bottle as the first couple sips seemed tight and a little underwhelming... but after a couple minutes and some nice swirls in the glass the dark fruity, roasty chocolate notes started really shining. Nice medium mouthfeel added to the complexity with a decent carbonation to brighten up the fruit and keep the boozy barrel flavors in the background.

1942,"2012-11-21",5.0,"Bottle at City Beer. Wow!  This is simply outstanding!  Black with a nice thick creamy off white head. Beware: I hear some bottles are flat, but this one is perfect. Beautiful floral bourbon, caramel, chocolate, and candy aroma. Nice silky palate, which tends lightly to the oily side.  Tastes of super smooth, mellow, buttery bourbon, milk chocolate, salted caramel, and tangy fruit notes with an amazing chocolate and oak finish. This pairs well with the Jamon Iberico I happen to be eating right now. This also happens to be seriously under rated. Ive only given a perfect score once before, but this is as good as it gets. Maybe I got an outstanding bottle, but I hope yours matches. Outstanding.","Berkeley, California, USA","badlizard"
1942,"2012-10-21",2.9,"Ive held off on reviewing this until I had a few samples for reasons that will become obvious.  Tried a bottle at Of Love and Regret, at my residence and on draft at Maxs.

Pours a still, opaque dark black with minimal tan head.  Looks like a stout.  Smells like bourbon and... bourbon.  Tastes like a glass of bourbon on the rocks that has been sitting around for two hours.  Literally, no trace of the base beer in any sample Ive had of this, just straight up, watery bourbon.  Held off reviewing after the first two bottle samples, but this on draft today was actually more disappointing than the bottles were.  The JD version of Folklore (that was sold in 750s) was infinitely more interesting and enjoyable than this was.  Get a grip everyone.  Aghing in PvW does not automatically make something amazing.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","yourefragile"

1942,"2012-10-13",3.8,"375ml bottle from Pinocchios.  Pours a jet black color with little to no head.  Aroma is bourbon, and not much else. Medium on the palate with almost zero carbonation.  I wont say its flat, but its close. Flavor is sweet, roasted malt, bourbon, oak, vanilla, more bourbon, with a nice roasty finish.  This is a tasty beer, but the barrel dominates. Im guessing that would be the case with most foreign stouts. A little more carbonation would be nice too.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","sherm1016"
1942,"2012-09-23",4.0,"375mL at Of Love & Regret. Deep pour with ruby highlights. Small mocha foam. Nose is sweeter golden raisins, small tomato paste, toasted sweet coconut, Irish coffee, fresh strawberry shortcake, vanilla bean ice cream, dark baked cherries. Taste is bitter, sharper dark and bittersweet chocolate, butter cream frosting, German chocolate cake. Small lemon acid. Clean, drinkable. Medium to lighter palate. Nicely bitter and tart. Lighter than expected. Palate is a bit papery- the weak point.

1942,"2012-09-09",4.2,"Bottle at Of Love and Regret. Dark brown, thin tan large bubbled head reduces to wisps and collar ring. Nose is brash pappy, peach and he harsh wood up front with rich dessert vanilla and chocolate heat through the end. Flavor shows brash wood and alcohol up front, becomes green apple fruit candy with delicate chalkiness accentuating sugar and honey before dry stout cocoa, woody bourbon finish. Bit thin, heat draws finish out even longer, warming through the rich dessert profile that rolls on, apple shooting in and out. Bourbon highlighted, light malt and marriage is one-sided, but balance and alcohol allow for exciting interplay, almost sessionable in fact.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

1942,"2012-08-19",2.7,"Bottle split with Amyliz4 and yourefragile at Of Love & Regret last night.  Served in stemware.  Pours nearly ink-jet black with a few bubbles of a head that quickly recede.  The nose carries loads of whiskey.  Its a nice whiskey, but theres nothing else really below it.  I wouldnt be able to say whether the base was a black saison, imperial stout, or whatever else had I not already known.  The same goes for the flavor.  Body is a bit hot, but not beyond the 8.4%.  Overall, this really just tastes like watered down whiskey with a bit of carbonation.  I think this could have turned out much better if it were blended back quite a bit.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"

1942,"2012-08-17",3.8,"Apparently, this is a different beer than the bourbon barrel Folklore, as the label specifically cites the Pappy Van Winkle barrels. 

The beer is dark brown with a viscous beige head that leaves ample lacing on the wine glass. The aroma offers roast, oak, bourbon. The flavor brings a silky smooth bourbon character with mild roast and a touch of chocolate. A nice bready character is in there as well. Really easy drinking with an outstanding feel on the palate. Hard to go wrong with PVW barrels. A nice offering from Stillwater.
