2562,"2017-05-20",3.9,"Top50. Miejsce 10-te.  
 Data ważności:  27.11.2017 
 Batch:  941 
 Kolor:  Błotny brązowy, piwo jest mętne i słabo przejrzyste. 
 Piana:  Na początku wysoka, zbita o drobnej strukturze i kremowym kolorze. Redukuje się do chmurki i świetnie krążkuje na szkle. 
 Zapach:  Aromat jest bardzo ciekawy. Z pewnością[ wybitnie słodowy. Czuć przypieczoną skórkę od chleba, toffi, sporo melanoidowych detali.
Jest lekka czekolada i sporo nut korzennych i przyprawowych. Całość okrasza delikatna ogniskowa, dymna wędzonka.
Fajnie ;) 
 Smak: Kosmos! Kompletny kosmos dla kubków smakowych. To piwo to jak mieszanka wielu stylów. Ogromna porcja słodów: karmel, przypieczony pszenny chleb, tosty, toffi. Dalej nuty gorzkiej czekolady i minimalna paloność przypominająca delikatną białą kawę.
W oddali masa ciemnych owoców, w szczególności wędzonych śliwek. Wędzonka dymna, śliwkowa, przechodzi w woń palonego drewna z ogniska. Daleko na szarym końcu piramidy nuty torfowe.
Goryczka średniej siły, dość wyraźna z dymionym tłem.
Ciało pełne, tekstura gęsta.
Alkohol dobrze wkomponowany.
Dość zapychające, ale smaczne.  

 Wysycenie:  Średnie. 
 Podsumowanie:  <br/)

Traditional Ale to bardzo ciekawy typ piw łączący ze sobą cechy historycznych i zapomnianych stylów piwnych.
Bestefar to piwo bogate, wielowymiarowe o mocnym słodowym charakterze. Łączy ze sobą cechy słodów z dość wyraźną dymioną, a nawet i torfową wędzonką. 
Fajne, nietypowa piwko.
W sam raz jako odskocznia od popularnych piwnych stylów.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

2562,"2017-04-08",4.2,"Aromat: piękny, intensywny aromat suszonych śliwek i czekolady, delikatna i bardzo aromatyczna wędzonka pochodząca od wędzonych słodkich owoców.
Wygląd: ciemnomiedziane, nieprzejrzyste, z ładną centymetrową warstwą piany, po chwili redukującej się do obwódki na powierzchni
Smak: słodkie, gęste, jest tu dużo gorzkiej czekolady, suszone owoce, wędzona śliwka, łagodna i bardzo harmonijna wędzonka, świetnie pasująca do całości. Dalej mamy pralinki, kakao, likierowość i paloną i kawową goryczkę w kontrze. Wysycenie niskie, bardzo przyjemny finisz gorzkiej czekolady rozpuszczającej się w ustach i trochę kawowej cierpkości.

Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a very dark brown color with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice and smoky, the brew smells like smoked malt, molasses, chocolate, and dark fruit. For the most part I think the taste is like the aroma, but theres also some woodiness and Tootsie Roll flavors noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit slick and smooth with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. I think its a good overall brew, I liked the smokiness in it. The smoke is there, but it doesnt overpower the rest of the brew. Definitely worth picking up! $8.99 a bottle.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
2562,"2016-12-04",4.7,"Most of the American brewing winter market tends to hearken to the English Strong Ale tradition with brown-colored (and often spiced) catch-all Winter Warmers.

It tastes like cured, smoked meat with lots of rich malt to go along with it. It would work beautifully as a companion to the Christmas ham, or it could be enjoyed all by itself as an evening closer.

3.25 T: Taste isnt quite as good as the nose. Chocolate, an almost tangy caramel, and a light spiciness. Nuts, pine, and molasses. Not nearly as dry as the nose. Indeed it verges on sweet. Its okay, but Im not a huge fan of the tanginess.

3.0 M: Lighter medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Light creaminess. The big complaint here is that its quite sticky and causes some amylase balling.

2562,"2015-02-09",4.1,"1 pint 9 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at approximately 45 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a deep mahogany brown, which doesnt let much light through in an ordinarily-lit room. Forms a decent-sized pale tan head with good retention, though little to no lacing.

Smell: Thats interesting. Theres more than a hint of some Belgian-esque yeast, with dark fruit and banana in the nose, atop a sweet malty backbone. Theres a just a faint hint of something musty beneath. This smells not unlike a quad, or BSDA.

Taste: Sour springs forth instantly as it touches the tongue, a dry, acetic sour that reminds one of a balsamic vinegar. The sourness floats atop a richly sweet malt, which itself contains dark fruits - hints of plum and black cherry. Through the middle, tones of fireplace ashes and leaves appear and disappear. The finish leaves a touch of the balsamic vinegar, mingled with an almost soda-like sweetness and a trace of burnt wood.

Mouthfeel: Very carbonated, almost sharp to drink, which the vinegar sourness plays off of.

Overall: An interesting beer, definitely of a sort I have never encountered before - much like a Flanders Red or Oud Bruin meeting a quadrupel. I dont know that I would repeat it, but it made for a fascinating experience.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

2562,"2013-01-02",3.6,"Finally a christmas beer that isnt dark brown with a red tint! This one pours a black body, with a light-brown head that sticks around for quite some time before reducing to a very thin layer and a foamy ring that leaves some lacing. The aroma is strong and roasted with coffee, dried dark fruits and faint sweet berries, smoky notes in the back and the usual Haandbryggeriet sour touch. An inviting aroma that isnt that different from the aroma of Nissefar? The taste is moderate sweet and the finish has a rather heavy bitterness bordering to astringent, that combined with a salty liquorice feeling and a strange acidity makes this a bit too rough. The finish is long with heavily roasted notes, coffee and smoke. Close to full body, oily texture and soft carbonation and some dryness in the finish. A strong, complex and powerful beer, and by sipping Im able to overcome the roughness.

2562,"2012-10-29",2.8,"A bit of a gusher upon opening uncapping. A large beige tower remains atop the dark chesnut pour forever. Tartish, whether voluntarily or not, gently smokey, very nutty, a bit burnt ale with a leafy, iodine touched late palate bearing the softest bitterness for a beer of its magnitude. Going a bit everywhere after its smooth, silky and neat  Marris Otter mouth entrance. Brown flavours quickly follow, being pushed around by agressive bubbliness which destroy the winter warmer aspirations. While the carbonation contributes to drying the caramel touches out, the gentle acidity feels a bit out of context without any fruitiness to lie unto. For my money, this was fairly under average for Haandbryggeriet. The uncontrolled carbonation, sludgey bottom and flavors that go in every direction felt a bit chaotic rather than their usual controlled, rational folly.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

2562,"2012-09-25",4.0,"500ml bottle from 2010. Slow gusher but emerges as a menacing jet black with lots of brown foam. Aroma is comprised of roasted malt, chocolate, berry fruit, campfire notes and bonfire toffee. The first thing I noticed was that it was quite thick and viscous on the tongue, but soon I started to pick up on the unexpected minty and peppery flavours that worked very well in this sort of beer. I also expected sweetness but found much more bitterness. Its a good thing I like surprises, so this beer really won me over.","Cheshire, ENGLAND","Nocturne"
2562,"2012-09-24",3.6,"My Bottom Line :  
Roasted malts, prunes, cloves and caramel swirl within this strong ales slender body, leading to peppery hops, chocolate and a rather storyless aftertaste.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A tower of foam rises atop the darkness.
-This brew needed time to breathe. Incoming infection, or improper bottle conditioning?
-Alcohol warmth appears in the finish.
-Mouthfeel was drier than expected; intense effervescence might have been indicative of something still going on in the bottle?

Dark, sweet aromas abound on the nose, with burnt caramel, treacle, some sweet spice and some lurking lighter fruit notes featuring. Spicy and herbal hops give quite a bitter start to the beer, moving into a dark and bitter body of coffee, supplemented by an almost cola-like sweetness. Berry notes are mixed with bitter herbs in the finish. This is, like so many Haandbryggeriet products, distinctly odd. In many ways it is quite like a stout, but much more herbal in taste, and a bit lighter in feel. It doesnt quite hit the mark in the way that some of their other efforts do, although it is still a very interesting and quite a rewarding beer.

2562,"2011-06-29",4.0,"Bottle. A steady, brown head forms as the dark brown, next to black beer fills the glass. Nice lacings occur as I sink it. Wehn poured, a nice spiced and roasted scent spreads, and a deeper inspection reveals faint notes of licorice, rather anise maybe, smoke and dark chocolate. As it warms up, I took it right from the fridge, some molasses aroma escapes the glass, followed by juniper and a faint alcohol touch. Its too sweet on the palate I think. Not too much sweet, but too sweet anyway. Molasses, licorice, roasted and burnt notes as well as a spiced touch and warming alcohol coates the mouth, before the bubbles try to clean it up. Its a quite heavily carbonated beer, especially considering the body fullness and ABV, and that is a bit negative on the drinkability. Not that its supposed to be a thirst quencher drank in mass glasses, but its nevertheless too carbonated. The alcohol finally get to show off in the finish, where it gives that lovely calm and relaxed feeling a night cap beer should give. I dont know if its supposed to serve this kind of purpose, it will be equally well suited with some nuts and dried fruits late Christmas eve, or with a good book in your favorite chair, preferrably by the fire in the dark time of year. To sum it up, Ive been a bit reluctant to try this one.

2562,"2011-06-17",3.7,"Bottle courtesy of heyta. Initially poured from a 16.9-ounce bottle at fridge temperature into a Mikasa tulip and allowed to warm. 

Pour yields a brew that is nearly black. Foam immediately shoots up to form a dense light mocha head with good lasting power, as it stays at a half-finger for most of my session with it. Some spotty lacing on the edges of the glass. The nose carries a good amount of wintry spice and what seems like a bit of juniper. The flavor is a nice combination of juniper and what seems similar to clove, if not that itself. A bit of roast there as well and a nice chocolate presence. Medium to full body with low-to-medium carbonation. Solid brew. A nice nearly-Summer treat.

Have been looking forward to trying this for quite some time now, thou I must admit that tasting this outside, mid-June in a park when its 26° was initially not how I intended to taste this for the first time, but right now I couldt care less. Here we go: Pours a deep deep brown near black body with some big dark sediments and a small lasting chocolate head. Aroma is surprisingly hopy and of course quite malt-roasty with some nice dark fruits, hints of smoke and something that my imaginations tells me is junipers(but its most likely not...). Lively carbonated, has a sticky oily mouthfeeling and can only be described as medium- to full-bodied. The flavors are not quite what I had expected; Tastes sweet-fruity with a dark and salty licorice twist. I also find some notes of smoke in the taste, but quite subtle. Perhaps a little leather in here as well, and in the end the typical Haandbryggeriet yeast-profile kicks in as it often does in their dark brews.

2562,"2011-05-14",3.8,"Born under the Taurus sign, this beer was destined for the throne. Two generations of men born and bred in good faith have passed away under its rule, and it is now reigning over the third. ""Give the Bestefar an inch and itll take a light-year,"" ejaculated brewmaster Sam Waterston upon concocting this she-devil of a libation. But would you trust a thrice-convicted dynamite fisherman? Methinks not. The Bestefar may sound like a carnival, but it smells like a beer. I am not at liberty to discuss the aroma any further than this. I am, however, free to discuss the properties of its appearance as much as necessary. Its a dark looking beer. The aroma? New car, musty doghouse, Islam, ammonia, and cliffs of dover. The taste? Otherworldly. That is to say it tastes earthy. The Bestefars got more rhymes than the church got ""ooh lords.""
