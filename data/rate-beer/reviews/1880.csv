Aroma: A rather sweet nose, malts, some apple, bread, and some sort candied sugary sweetness

Appearance: It pours a mostly clear golden color with a small white head and some spotty lacing

Flavor: Taste is heavy sweet, the components are the same as the nose, with a grain/bread finish

Palate: The body is medium, it has a slightly cloying, smooth feel, and just a hint of heat on the finish

Overall Impression: 
I didnt love this one.  They were a little heavy handed with the sweetness for my taste, and there was something fake sugary about the feel that also took away from it for me.  Overall, this wasnt terrible, but it certainly wasnt for me.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

My first impression of the aroma is lots of spicy noble hops, with a light citrus undertone.   Then I get a nice malty honey and doughy yeast aroma as well.   The flavor is malty with a little sweetness at first, and then finishes with a powerful hop spice and long bitter finish.   Simple, clean malt flavors, with a touch of alcohol hotness.   This takes the balance and drinkability of a good pils and takes it up a couple notches.   The super clean malt flavors avoid the sticky, cloying sweetness that can happen in the style, but there is still a substantial enough body to let you know you are drinking a stronger beer.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

It is light copper gold with a dense, creamy, off-white head steadily shrinking to a thin head.  The smell is raisiny with fruity grain and some hops, honey, bread dough, hay, a bit alcoholic, but smoothly so.

1880,"2007-09-25",3.6,"Bottle Date of 03.22.07, Sampled September 2007
This beer sits in my glass with a brilliantly clear, pretty, copper color, when held up to the light it shows an orange tinged, gold color.  The head starts out almost three-fingers in height and is a pale tan color.  The aroma has a nice grain character to it up front and is finished with some lightly herbal hop notes mixed in.  Aromatic notes of biscuits, sweet honey-like grain, hints of orange flower nectar, lightly caramelized bread crust, and a green, herbaceous note intermingle in the nose, with none really being dominant.

Lightly sweet, but with an immediately noticeable, slightly astringent, bitterness.  The beer finishes with a doughy malt character as well as some caramelized grain sugar notes.  Uncharacteristically these notes seem to linger more than the bitterness that was found mostly up front in this beer.  Fairly thick and rich, though the lightly zesty carbonation helps to temper this a bit.  Some touches of honey character as well as a minty hop note in the finish.

This is quite tasty and I really like the touch with the noticeable hop character; it is perhaps a touch more than traditional German examples, but it is a welcome addition.  I have always welcomed the hoppy pale bocks (something I really consider this ""new"" Double Pilsner thing to be a part of).  This beer is quite easy to drink, in some ways I wish it had a bit more character, but it seems to want to be quaffed by the liter, which would be quite dangerous.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Just as tasty as ever.  Sweet, caramely, malty nose with a lager feel to it, just like what a good Maibock should smell like.  The sweet, caramel is alive in the flavor, dominating all else.  Very gently bitter, the balance is very much tilted toward the malty end.  Mild alcohol seems to come out in the finish.  Full bodied, sweet, rich, and fairly sticky on the long-lasting palate.  Bright amber in color and fully clear of course, with a sizeable, off-white head to start.  As the head fades to a small halo, it leaves a few wide, intricate rings at the top of the glass.

Nice malty taste. There is jus a touch of aluminum going on but the sweetness just about covers it up. Nice flavor.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
1880,"2004-05-25",3.4,"Sandy auburn, delicate head. Aroma is fresh herbs and shredded salad--zesty and earthy. A little bit of baseline sweetness contributed by the malts. Flavor is initially sweet, any sugariness is propelled away by a nice bitting hoppy dryness and a smidgeon of tasteful EtOH. This is a nice one. The sixer says 16.5 Plato OG, which Im guessing translates to about 6.5% ABV. A good lighter bock.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","grant"
1880,"2004-05-23",3.8,"Medium gold color. Small white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. A medium bodied bock. Malts are fruity and very sweet, caramel and malts. Hops are slightly spicy. Nicely balanced, big bold bock. Alcohol is very evident and the alcohol oiliness is very noticeable. Nicely balanced. Smooth taste. Hints of wood and smoke in the middle, Finishing crisp and biting. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

The beer upon its release from the 12-ounce brown bottles set in the glass a slightly hazy amber color with a moderate in size bright white head the is semi-creamy in texture and as it evaporates the lace formed is a fine sealing sheet. Nose is malt laden, sweet, quite crisp and clean with the start lightly sweet and nicely malted with the top light. Finish is stern in its acidity and the hops delectable in their spiciness, very dry aftertaste and a nice drinking beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
