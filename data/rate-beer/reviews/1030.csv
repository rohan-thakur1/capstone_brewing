1030,"2016-10-01",4.2,"Crowler... This beer rocks! Pours murky and black with no head. Smells great  a chocolate bomb; featuring a decadent mélange of fudge, chocolate chips and chocolate crème flanked by lesser notes of leather, vanilla and coconut. Full-bodied and silky with minimal carbonation. The flavor offers a collage of chocolate crème and brownie brittle with nuances of vanilla and caramel. Lightly roasty and faintly sweet in the fatty, velvety finish. Kudos to landhoney for supplying this world class bottle of beer!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

1030,"2016-03-09",4.8,"Much thanks to Kraddel! Crowler sampled. Yay my first crowler. Beer is in an amazing condition considering that there are a few months on this crowler. I think that it would a smidgeon better if it were in a bottle but it still tastes really amazing. Pours black, head is instantly gone. Nose is massive thick syrup, warming, vanilla, mocha, thick warming bourbon syrup, sugar, Taste is gorgeous thick syrup, sweet sugar, warming, chocolate syrup, massively thick & sludgy in the best way, chocolate sugar, finish carries lingering vanilla & sweet vanilla bourbon. Amazingly thick & syrupy. When Cycle is good, they are really good. Chugged the bottom of the crowler, not recommended, it is warming when you sip but when you chug it really starts tasting massively alcoholic.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

1030,"2015-11-22",5.0,"Tap at Cycle. Aroma is just insanely good. Huge cookie dough, vanilla, sugar cookies, bourbon, chocolate cake, burnt caramel and marshmallow. Tastes incredible too. Perfect mellow sweetness to counter the bourbon. Burnt marshmallow, cookie dough, chocolate cake, molasses, oak, vanilla, and light rye spiciness. Seriously tastes like bourbon soaked smores.
