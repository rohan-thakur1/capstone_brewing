709,"2015-03-22",3.7,"Bottled on 12/17/14. Just a tad nervous as I started and thought about the date.
This was poured into a pint glass. 
The appearance was a black color with a quickly dissipating one finger white foamy head that didnt leave any lacing. 
The smell had a sweet sticky roasty coffee and light citrus bitterness combining nicely. 
The taste took those previously mentioned flavors to combine and spark in a light roasted edged citrus aftertaste leading into a slightly sticky finish. There also was a light spice in the initial taste probably from the rye.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sipping quality to it. Alcohol not felt but might have assisted in preserving the mouthfeel a bit as a light spice came rolling out over my tongue.

709,"2015-02-15",4.2,"12oz bottle, from Dutchs. Bottled 12/30/2014, rated about 3 weeks ago.. Black color, with a good finger of khaki head. Leaves decent bits of lace. Great roast and earthy hop character. Nice bit of coffee. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, crisp, lighter carbonation. Good chewy texture. Lightly slick finish. Nice moderate to bigger bitter taste. Lighter to moderate sweet taste. Love this. Super smooth, easy-drinking and flavorful. All of the earthy hops and roast, coffee malt flavors that I love from a perfect black IPA. Mild spicy grain rye is a perfect addition; rye repeatedly proves that its at home in a black IPA. I heard this was good, but it beat my expectations. Fantastic super-long finish. The malt profile and body kind of reminds me of Founders Porter -- these guys really know how to brew a dark beer. Glad they decided to distribute this one.

709,"2015-01-20",4.2,"Founders Black Rye is apparently an older recipe in the days before Black IPAs were en vogue. Drinking it today it seems exactly like a beer of that style rather than the supposedly unclassifiable brew it purports to be. The rye is subtle here; subtle to the point that its an afterthought rather than one of the central flavor characteristics. Though, its a beer like this that goes to show that styles really dont mean jack, and an excellent beer should be appreciated for its excellence.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a goblet. It was bottled on 12/12/14 and cost $4.95 ($0.41 per ounce).

Appearance: Ink black color with blood red highlights. Pours to a small, tan, foamy head which retains and laces fairly well.

Smell: Strong dank/piney hops plus dark malt character.

Taste: Theres a certain flavor combination of hops and dark malt that works so well. That synergy of dank, resiny, piney hop bitterness and bitter, roasted malt just work wonders together. Both are present immediately on the palette here. Up front theres dank bitterness followed by bittersweet dark chocolate flavor with a hint of espresso through the middle. As good as the first half is, the second half is even better with strong bitterness and an almost luscious piney/sappy taste. The label indicates the beer is 78 IBUs and its quite clear thats no exaggeration. The hops certainly are the focal point, though the malt base is strong enough to keep the palette balanced. Oddly enough, there isnt much distinct rye character except for some spiciness on the finish. Its a good way to end this delectable palette, though Id like to see it used more prominently (especially considering the name of the beer).

Drinkability: This is probably the kind of beer most people would consider to be on the bigger side. At 7.5% ABV, Founders Black Rye isnt exactly a session brew. That being said, its not gentle sipper, either. Its full-bodied for sure, but the mouthfeel is a bit crisper and cleaner than youd expect. No sticky, syrupy texture to speak of, and a good amount of carbonation to scrub itself clean. Works great as a nightcap, though I could see it pairing well with a savory dinner.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

709,"2015-01-20",3.2,"Founders Black Rye has a thin, beige head, a black (with ruby highlights, under direct sunlight) appearance, and splotchy lacing left on the glass. The aroma is of piney & citrusy hop resin, and thats about it. Taste is of standard hop resin, some char, and a bit of sweet malt. Bitterness might be rated at 78 IBU, but this beer is NOT particularly bitter. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Founders Black Rye finishes semi-dry and drinkable. No alcohol showing up in the aroma or flavor. If I did not know this beer contained rye, Id never think of it. This beer is similar to many other run-of-the mill, hop-resin ales of the last four or five years. I would not pick this one to introduce a Coors Light drinker to craft beers, since Coors Light is arguably better than this. Yes, I think it is better, on second thought.

709,"2007-11-26",4.3,"Pours a dark chocolate brown (almost black) with an enormous, dense, frothy, tan head that leaves sticky, glass-coating, creamy lace, once it eventually recedes. With a proper pour, a half inch of liquid yields a glassful of head; it reminds me of what you get from pouring root beer over vanilla ice cream. Patience is a virtue with this beer, as you will  be waiting a while for the head to diminish. Once it does, the aroma is quite enticing: chocolate, toffee and spicy rye notes commingle in a sweet-toasty harmony. Medium-bodied and creamy-slick with a moderately bitter, toasted finish. The flavor is of chocolate, chestnuts and mildly spicy rye with a supremely well-integrated hop finish. I really like Reds Rye, and this beer is even better.

The name doesnt lie. Black Rye pours black, some faint dark brown highlights shine through around the edges. A tan creamy 1+ finger head formed on the pour and stayed put for the remainder. Leaves sheet lacing. Good looking brew.

Unique aroma. Lightly roasted malts are the soul behind this beer but the real highlight comes from the dry-hopping and addition of rye. Mild chocolate hangs around with those lightly roasted malts but the spiciness of the rye and citrus (grapefruit rind) of the hops take over.

The flavor might be even more unique than the aroma. Lightly roasted malts lead into a black malt acidity that just before it becomes too much (and you think it will) the chocolate and mild lactic character take over. Spicy rye comes through mid-palate along wit ha nice hopping that adds some spice and bitterness until the swallow. Excellent!

Medium body with a light smoothness. Mild tingling bitterness from the rye and hop load. Carbonation somewat tingles the tongue.

Definately an easy drinker. The myriad of flavors make this one to sip and sip and sip trying to figure it all out. Not hugely complex but definately layred expertly.

Founders comes through with another winner. This beer is so unique and delicious I cant wait to drink another. The brewers at Founders are some of the best in the country at brewing so many different styles, everyone of them excellent.

The finish is dry with some rye bitterness.  I had the Red Rye earlier in the evening and enjoyed it very much, but this one is even better.  Definetly more going on here.

A thin, fizzy head lasted for a few moments, then faded into a few lingering bubbles.  The aroma consisted of roasted chocolate malts, nuts, and a bit of light piney hops sitting in the background.  The flavor was slightly biting, and bitter at the start.  Then it was followed up by some chocolate and coffee notes that lingered.  The mouthfeel was lightly carbonated and medium-bodied.

709,"2007-05-29",1.5,"Founders Black Rye, in a 12 oz brown stubby bottle with a twist off cap. Smell is slightly strong, like you know you are going to get an impact on your taste buds. Pour is very black with barely an orange tinge on the edges. The taste is extremely rude, like and impy stout or Baltic porter. The only other specialty grain I have to compare this to was also made by founders.  However, the red rye was much more palatable than this.  If you like those impy stouts or Baltic porters you better put this on your list to try. Medicinal back of the throat bitterness that just dont quit.  Think of beer filtered thru an old wet campfire or the taste of lye on the palate. Very difficult to enjoy for a lager lover. Will not buy again, but OK to try once. Somebody please get an Old Heathen to wash this down with. Rude and acrid, like an imp stout. If you are trying dark beer for the first time better stay away from this. Almost as bad as Lion Stout, Bells Expedition or Old Rasputen. No manners and very offensive.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

This has happened on several occasions with Founders Rye beers (Reds and Black).  Appearance is black - very stout-looking.  Huge fluffly off white head.  Very much a well balanced IPA or possible a strong ale, in my opinion, with a dark color and rye highlights.  The rye is not overpowering at all very subtley balanced.

Dark Rye pours a dark crimson body and a tall tan head, lacing the inner glass from start to finish. The aroma shows some oats and a nice playing on the Rye. The use of Chocolate Malts are profound, a big dose of black coffee, and bakers chocolate. The flavor is full of chocolaty bitterness with an accompanying spicy hop character that adds a long dry citric finish. A black IPA this is indeed as it reminds me alot of Averys New World porter, which was already an immense favorite of mine!

There is no doubt that this beer is grainy, which isnt usually a good thing, but in this case I feel it establishes a solid backbone for the rest of the flavours. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but I dont feel this takes away much from the awesomeness that is Founders Black Rye. From the aroma to the taste, this beer is intense, just as beer should be.

709,"2007-03-26",3.3,"Tap at Boston Brookline Publick House.  Almost black body with an almost-see-through soft-drink appearance.  Some liquorice and lime on the nose.  Rather light body surprisingly lacking in the malt department.  Dark malts without the roasted flavours, some figs notes.  Despite being a black beer theres nothing heavy in the body.  Nothing creamy, no chocolate or coffee flavours.  Hops are of the citrusy type and provide a nice tartness.  Even at 7% thats a light black beer meant to be drank in large quantity.  Pleasant beer but at the Brookline Publick House they had both the Founders Black Rye and the Founders Breakfast Stout on tap.  The Black Rye cant hold a candle to the Breakfast Stout unless of course you have a bottle of both side by side and you stick a candle in the Black Rye bottle.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

This beer shared more qualities with an Imperial Stout than with any other style IMO, though there are some differences.  Color was dark brown with ruby hightlights.  Aroma was roasted malts and bitter chocolate.  Flavor was burnt malts, chocolate, hops, but was a little bit watered-down.  I would have liked more vibrant flavors in a beer like this.

The aroma is bitter chocolate and roasted malt.  The taste is very similar: very, very roasted malt, burnt pizza crust, and a nice bitter chocolate.  The finish is very dry and leaves a bit of a burnt malt flavor on the palate.  I really, really enjoy this beer.  It reminds me a bit of Three Floyds Alpha Klaus, but its quite a bit cheaper, making it an excellent choice.  Another great Founders brew.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","surlysober"

Deep ruby-black pour with a soapy light brown head.  Taste is bitter roast, not intimidating, but strong enough to drive its point home.  Hops are there as the base, seem refined.  Light nuttiness.  Medium-light body.  Finish is smooth cream and malt and pleasantly - and gently - warming.  After a few ounces, nuanced grapefruit begins to squirt through.

One of the best American Strong Ales that I have had to date.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","Illini08"
709,"2007-01-14",4.0,"Pours a very dark with just sme hints of ruby highlights around the edged. Theres a two finger head that settles slowly to a thick cap, leaving behind thick clumps of foam on my glass.

Smell; spicy rye up front, that I find very inviting. Chocolate and coffee notes are present, as well as some hints of hops.

Taste; the rye really stands, and brings a nice spiciness to this. The chocolate is a little stronger than I expected, and is joined by a little coffee and a nice roasted, nutty maltiness. Theres also a bit of a floral hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is nice and full, and almost dangerously drinkable.

Ive had this on tap before, and the bottled version is just about as good as I remember it being on tap. Hopefully Ill be able to pick up another sixer of this next year.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"
709,"2007-01-12",4.0,"Pours from bottle to snifter a dark brown, almost black color with sone copper-orange highlights. Produces an immense, rocky tan head which slowly settles to a durable 1/4"" coating. An amazingly complex aroma greets the nose with upfront notes of dusty/earthy hops, spicy crushed caraway seeds, rye, dark roasted malts and cocoa. Found the palate to be full, but was way too spritzy for the style. Less CO2 would have provided a silkier mouthfeel. Flavors seemed a bit more subdued as compared to the aromas. However, lots semi-sweet  burnt malt and chocolate initially, followed by a firm hit of an earthy and citrusy hop presence. A subtle taste of spicy rye grain is left on the tongue in the finish. A very unique and pleasing dark ale. Perhaps a dark IPA to be more precise. Worth seeking out for sure.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

The head was very large and seemed to have quite a bit of foam that collapsed very quickly. I have never seen anything like it, but I am pretty sure its nothing like an infection. Smell is very interesting too. Theres a smell of a bit of candy, I think. Also seems to have a bit of nuttiness in this one. I can defintely smell the rye in this one.

Nose reminds me of chocolate covered cherries (with liquer).  Oh my this tastes so good!  The initial taste is roasted caramel and some fuit.  Then it becomes more sweet and chocolate-like.  The finish is slightly roasted, bitter rye.  The after taste reminds me of dark roast espresso.  The alcohol starts to peek out more as the beer warms up some.  This beer has a medium body, but the mouthfeel is rich, smooth, and almost creamy.  I just love rye beers (and rye bourbon), especially if it is a Founders rye beer!  Both the Founders Red Rye and Black Rye are awesome and unforgettable!  I think that the black rye might even be more impressive and complex than the red rye.

709,"2006-06-19",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2006 Rerate: Had on tap and the hops were much more dominant. Hurt the complexity of the beer.

Smells like dark chocolate wrapped in hops. This bottle is about six months old, so the hops have diminished a bit from when I had it last, so the aroma isnt getting top scores, but I think the age has improved the flavor! Tastes like chocolate, some nuttiness, rye, some sourness, some alcohol. Finishes rich, creamy, and smokey with perfect bitterness. This is exactly what Ive been looking for- a complex beer that isnt 10% plus alcohol and it comes in a 12 oz bottle for under $2 per!

This is smooth and creamy on the tongue with a bit of viscosity on its own and a slight alcohol warming.  Truly pleasant to drink!  The flavor is incredible in my opinion.  A big sweet somewhat chocolately malt backdrop overwhich there is the roasty charcoal, spicy rye, liberal hopping, and touches of alcohol.  I feel like each of these flavors pick up where the other left off forming something like a chord or a ""wall of flavor"".  Really complimentary flavors with complexity not solely for the sake of complexity, but to genuinely be enjoyed.  Theres also a bit of smoke and the slightest touch of dark fruit.  As the flavor lingers the charcoal, hops, and rye taper off very nicely together.  I really lament that this is my only bottle... I will have to hunt down some more, without question!!
rerate: 20 July 2007
I still enjoy this beer.  Its appeared in the area regularly though, so Ive gotten to drink a good deal more of this stuff, and some flaws have become apparent, though this is still a very lovely beer.
4 for appearance still.  Dark dark brown with a subtle tan head, not much though.  9 for aroma.  A strongly piney rye pungently dominates.  Alcohol and a well proportioned malt sweetness.  A bit of roast fills in to give this some balance.  A still think this is a unique set of odor sensations, just like the first time.  4 for palate.  A subdued body low in CO2 but still a bit creamy.  8 for flavor.  Roast, sweetness, piney rye all vie for attention.  Sweet malt backbone, some caramel, though with diacetyl butteryness, give this a creaminess, though it works largely.  A hint of coffee and maybe chocolate.  A silky smooth creamy finish.  18 overall.  I can still drink this at least once a week, but its hard to call this as so close to perfection now.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"
709,"2006-06-17",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 31, 2006 Dark colour, with a small bubbly head.  The aroma is my favorite part of this beer.  Its chocolatey, malty, with rye, roasty, and a bit hoppy.  There is a lot going on in the aroma, but it all works really well together.  In the flavour you get less of the chocolate (though its still definitely there!), less malt, and more of the roasty flavours, a lot more hops, the rye really comes out nicely and some nutty flavours.  Finishes with toasted nuts and some bitterness.  A great beer!","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","tcruicks"

The nuttiness came through stronger in this tasting, along with a light citrus under the piney hops, and then the dry rye finish stands out the most in combination with the hops. Original rating: Poured black with very thin brown edges. Nice intial head and great lacing, a pretty beer. The aroma was grainy and light wheat or rye. The flavor was of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, and some resinous hops. Was unable to pick up the rye in the flavor until this warmed a little, then the rye bread / wheaty flavors came out more, especially in the aftertaste.

Theres a solid hop bitterness at the finish resulting in a mouth dryness that lasts a long time, teasing you. It also has a backbone chocolate milk sweetness that really isnt too sweet at all.

709,"2006-01-30",3.7,"Bottle from Archer Liquors. One of those beers that is very enjoyable yet its hard to get the numbers up to the relative level of enjoyment. It could have something to do with my inherent fascination with rye beers and that this is pretty much the best, and that Ive finally got the bottle that I cant at all get locally... I mean, rye is such a great grain! Rye bread, rye whiskey, rye beer... what more could you ask for. Its important that I mention this fascination because this may very well be one of those cases where something is so exciting in concept that I love it before I even try it and refuse to accept that its actually just mostly average in the end. 

OK, onto the beer. Pours deep, stout-like black with a big, crisp head and great lacing. Aroma is very grainy, with nice rye, sprouts, almonds, a touch of hopping at the end. Taste is kinda harsh grains. Rye is definitely noticable, with bitter hops in the finish. Palate is thin though also buttery and very drinkable.

709,"2006-01-28",3.7,"From a bottle that I had left in my friends fridge for a very long time, maybe a year or more!  There was a little off flavor in the beers Id had before, probably due to poor storage, but it seems to have mellowed out! This beer is much like the description.  Its extremely dark, moreso than the average stout or porter, with a light tan head for me.  Aroma is a mix of roastiness and hops with something almsot a little spicey inbetween the two.  Flavour is the same, roastiness with chocolate, malt, a little nuttiness and toffee, and behind that comes a slightly herby/floral, ever so slightly piney hop character, mostly in the nose.  As someone before me said, its kind of a pumpernickel effect (Id call it a little spicey, perhaps thats the sharpness of the rye coming in)  For how dark it is, you expect it to be maybe a bit richer in flavour, and heavier in body, so thats a bit...weird.

Medium-bodied and smooth across the palate, with a sticky, spicy, almost cloying chocolate finish.  Residual bitterness around the tongue and at the top of the throat.

Cant pick up any specifics in the hops with all this lip-smacking malt around. Yet its nicely dried but not soured, and theres a touch of walnut torte in the finish.

709,"2005-10-11",3.8,"(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with Pailhead, thanks Kevin!) Having just sampled Founders American Black Ale, the Black Rye isn’t quite matching up for me.  It smells more like a dry stout to me; it’s roasty, but not as roasty as most stouts.  It also smells moderately hoppy and grassy, and also a bit yeasty to me.  The flavor is very roasty, fairly bitter, and even a bit hoppy while showing only a mild sweetness.  Medium ""plus"" in body, with a dry palate throughout, and a fairly crisp finish.  Dark brown in color, with mahogany highlights at the edges, the body is capped by a small, quarter-inch head, light-tan in color, and that demonstrates amazing persistence.  I’ve taken my sweet time savoring this beer, yet there is still a full coating atop the beer.  Lacing is modestly dense for awhile before dissipating to spottiness.  A relatively straightforward, but solid, well-crafted beer that’s been pleasant and enjoyable.  However, it’s close enough to your basic dry stout that I don’t feel the need to trade for more bottles.  I can get something ""similar enough"" in local stores.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Flagrant rye does combat with a motherload of freshly harvested hops.  Some chocolate, dark cigar wrappers and wet birch wood harmoniously assault my nose as well.  Flavor seals the deal.  Rye and chocolate malts are curt, layering on black licorice in a silent but deadly sequence.  Some burnt pumpernickel dinner rolls, rye Chex Mix chips and a hearty Turkish coffee bite.  Oozy fluidity and a palate rapist.  Everything balance-wise is amped-up like it should be, almost as if I special ordered it.  Burnt walnuts come in on the finish, along with bittering agents, espresso sludge and an oily layer on the palatary playing field.  Very impressive.  I dont think this beer could have been brewed any better.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Beautiful aroma of bountifully fluffed espresso roast and roasted rye. Dry fudge, charred chocolate, and green hop bitterness of spruce all make favorable encounters within. Its not huge by any means, just solidly present and fresh. Love it.

Taste is wildly decadent with dark bittering tones of char, chocolate, espresso, dry spruce pine, spicey toasted rye bread, vanilla, and dry fudge. Great roasted edge the whole way through as well as the all encompassing chocolate undertone that sets the stage for the charred stuff and bitterness. A near perfect blend of darkly roasted flavors, moderate bitterness, and subtle dryness.

Clean and roastified medium quick body. Low and even set carbonation and slick even while the roast and bitterness take its hold.

Poured nearly pitch black with a nice medium sized chocolate ice cream-colored head.  There were a few floaties in it -- Im not sure where they came from -- but other than that the beer looked very appetizing.  The aroma was big on bittersweet chocolate, coffee (so I guess Id call it ""mocha"") and resinous hops.  A little sour and vinous smelling -- maybe the rye?  Flavors are strong, chocolately, with roasty sweetness up front and coffee and sourish, sticky hops in back.  A little fizzy.  I certainly did not give this beer the highest marks, but it definitely is good -- Ive enjoyed the three bottles that Ive had so far.

The aroma lends itself to a hoppy bitterness, but the roasted bitterness up front takes one by surprise.  Once recovering, a moderate sweetness comes across the tongue.  Despite this, the layered bitterness of the hops join the roasted malt to make it really interesting.  Things keep confusing the senses, but each change is pleasant and welcome.

709,"2005-04-05",3.7,"Dark brown body, short-lived head.  Interesting aroma, with the tartness of the citric hops mingling with chocolate and coffee.  Good lush mouthfeel.  Unique flavors.  Nutty, slightly chocolatey, some stale coffee, good bitterness to balance the sweetness.  Interesting grainy aftertaste, I suppose from the rye?  Satisfying.","DeForest, Wisconsin, USA","howie"
709,"2005-04-02",3.9,"Bottle courtesy of Styles: Dark brown that appears black when in the glass; small tan head.  The aroma coming from this one is dominated by roasted malt & chocolate scents, with some coffee, spicy rye, penut shells, and a hint of citrus & grass.  Medium-full bodied and  softly carbonated.  It tastes quite bitter up front with notes of cocoa powder, roasted malt, and peppery rye.  Towards the middle I get a hint of caramel buried in there somewhere, as well as vanilla, and some citrus/grass hops that give off some light fruit notes if you hold it in your mouth for a bit.  Finishes dry with a bitter roasted nut flavor and tons of roasted malt & rye.  The mouthfeel and carbonation are excellent and the use of rye really adds some extra depth to the taste and smell.  I really enjoy this and reds rye from Founders.  Edit: If you let it breathe for a bit and warm to room temperature youll notice some nice fruity, sweet hop notes in the flavor & finish intermingling with the rye.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

Interesting twist of aromas here with notes of roasted coffee, rye, dusty cocoa, with dried citrus fruit backing it up.

Roasty malt flavor to start, a hint of hop bitterness in the middle, and a wonderful choco-roasty-malt finish.  The rye lends a beautiful bitterness in the finish also.  This is another incredible beer from the folks at Founders.  The sweetness just before the roasty bitter finish is impeccable.

Mellow grapefruit undertones. Well balanced palate thanks to the absence of acidity fmo those big hops. Expressive rye, well-hidden alcohol leads to a treachorously easy to drink beer. Light roastiness kicks in and overcomes the hops, so its hardly piney nor grapefruity in the finish. I enjoyed that. Smooth and mellow creamy texture brings coke memories with its big biting bubbles.

709,"2005-03-04",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2005 Its surprising how distinct the rye flavor is in this one. Aroma is similar to a roasty porter, but the distinction comes in the flavor and aftertaste. Up front there is a dry roasted grain flavor with notes of hops and chocolate. In the end there is a deep rye flavor that complements very well. A little more body would help IMO, but this makes you want to continuosly drink as the dryness of the rye overtakes you.

The taste was the equal of the aroma with the hops at the forefront and a solid malty and chocolatey background. Coffee, smoke and hazelnut notes also appear.

709,"2004-12-20",4.0,"2004 bottle.  Wonderful deep burgundy-violet hued brown ale, with some darker, almost black tinges and a small off-white, old piano key colored head.  Aroma of sweet milk chocolate, light roasted notes, pieces of hops hit the nose as well.  Some dry, herbal/anise-like notes on the end.  Flavor begins, quite unexpectedly, with a dose of very sweet toffee and light rye notes.  The beer progresses through a thick bodied godiva liqueur-like flavor with toasted malts providing some nutty nuances.  Syrupy (almost) caramel and roasted grains round out the finish, with some very bitter citric hops.  Kind of tastes like one of those chocolate oranges that you smack and then they break apart.

Flavor is an interesting blend of American hops and dark roasted grains, think porter hopped like an American IPA.

709,"2004-09-27",3.9,"Color of a classic porter (brownish/black with deep, ruby highlights).  Head is tan.  Solid, black malt roast, cream, just-picked, spicy, floral hops, and perfumey rye aroma.  Flavor is much the same (good) with black malt dryness dominating at mid-palate then hop flavor and rye malt in the long finish.  The flaked rye creates a slightly gelatinous mouthfeel that is complemented by the hop flavor but is sharply contrasted and dried out by the black malt.  A little more hop acidity would clean this up even more.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","AlchemistZ"

i was surprised by how flavorful this beer was...spicy, hoppy, and citrus-like flavor complementing its dark roasted taste.  Very pleased!","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","badnewsbeers"
709,"2004-09-24",3.6,"We have a winner. Great rye bite, slight sourness, and piney hops on top of smoky malting. Body a tad thin. Flavorful. Not subtle by any stretch!","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
709,"2004-09-22",3.8,"On tap at Founders and also newly bottled (the first new bottled Founders beer in some time).  This is a rather aggressively hopped dark rye beer; the crisp, spicy, piney hops complement the tingly, spicy, and somewhat fruity rye malt.  The flavor profile is quite dense and almost takes on a roasted character.  I think this will be popular once its distributed.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
