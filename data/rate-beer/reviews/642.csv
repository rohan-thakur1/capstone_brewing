642,"2017-03-27",3.8,"Pint at the brewery. Black beer with a tan head. The coffee character exceeds my expectation, immediately jumping out in the aroma. Its ashy, fruity like berries, and gives reasonable roast. The mouthfeel is full, supporting the massive latte flavors. Milky sweetness balances things out in the flavor with hints at chocolate with a far-off ashtray finish. I like the bold use of coffee, great example of the style.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
642,"2017-03-24",4.9,"Everything is awesome about this beer. Great balance. Great flavor. The body is very heavy. If it was a bit lighter on the palate... you got a perfect beer. That coffee... so good.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Jamesthebrit"

642,"2016-12-30",3.8,"Sample at the taproom (as ""Tin Cup Camp Stout""). Brown-black color with a medium foamy tan head that diminishes steadily to an outer ring. Partial rings of lacing. Roast malt, coffee and chocolate aroma. Light to medium body with a roasty coffee and malt character, with some milk chocolate in the background. The The finish is roasty coffee and chocolate. Pretty good overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
642,"2016-11-15",3.9,"On the menu at The Porter as ""Tin Cup Camp Stout"". Pours a deep brownish black on tap with fluffy tan brown head that leaves moderate lace. Aroma of a hint of smoke under big dark roast coffee notes and a touch of earth. Taste follows, but add a bit of sweet milk chocolate. Really nicely balanced stout, tasty.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","jbruner"

642,"2016-08-22",3.5,"On tap at the brewery listed as ""Tin Cup Coffee Stout"" same 5.6%. Black with a tan head. Aroma is cold coffee. Taste is lots of very bitter coffee, almost like drinking a very powerful cold roast. Touch of chocolate and roast. Definitely more coffee than beer. Body is coffee thin, low carbonation.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
642,"2016-07-17",3.5,"Nice stout. A little on the thin side for a stout, but nice roastiness and coffee.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

642,"2015-12-30",4.4,"On tap at the brewery taproom. Listed as 7% ABV and 44 IBU.

Pours essentially black with a good head and very good lacing.

Aroma: exceptionally fine coffee with a trace of black bread. 

Flavor: supreme coffee flavor. Just the right amount of mild bitterness.  his is the best tasting coffee beer Ive ever had! The coffee flavor is fairly strong and dominant but not too strong: theres some nice dark bread elements too. 

Very smooth, near full body with low but near perfect carbonation. 

Overall: superb coffee stout!","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
642,"2015-12-23",4.1,"Draft at taproom. Pours black with a thin khaki head. Leaves some lacing in the glass. Big bitter coffee notes on the nose. I can't say I'm getting much of the lactose but I love the bitterness of the coffee. I find that bitterness refreshing compared to most of the style. Nice.

642,"2015-12-14",4.0,"Growler from the brewery. Pours jet black into the glass with a nice tan head that leaves trace lacing. The nose is of nice morning coffee... just beautiful! Flavors of roasted coffee, bitter chocolates, dark berries and lactose sugars finish with a hint of ginger and licorice. The mouthfeel is beautifully crafted; smooth and coffee-esque, deeply complex and substantial. Just a gorgeous cross between a rich coffee stout and smooth, easy-drinking milk stout. Have your coffee and cream in this awesome offering! Keep it up, Burial. The best beer in Asheville, Ill say it again. Nothing but quality from this superb brewery.","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"
