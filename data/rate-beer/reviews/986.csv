Hazy maize pour with a big fluffy white head. Spicy, leathery nose. Flavor brings an enormous dose of band-aid -- this has to be the most band-aidy beer Ive ever had. At first I think ""how can I drink this"", but then I realize its just what I need as I sit here trying to write on a summers evening: a beer that fits summer but is entirely not designed for quaffing. As hard as I try I just cant fall in love with Ommegangs yeast, but this is an interesting beer and I dont really regret having a glass half full of it in front of me. That said, its so far from a 99th percentile Belgian ale that I fear for the beer-youth of America, even if Ommegang is an old-school kind of overrated.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

986,"2015-07-02",4.0,"BBD 06/15. Hazy (due to yeast) golden pour. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

World class nose of floral hops, lemon notes, subtle clove phenols from the yeast and a biscuit background.

Light medium body with a smooth texture that has just a hint of creaminess. Perfect carbonation with effervescence from the middle on and a rousing prickly finish.

The almost outstanding flavor profile is intense, fairly complex but fails to completely cover the alcohol and lacks enough biscuit to balance. Floral hops lead coupled with a bit of lemon. The middle brings a mild bitterness and subtle and fleeting biscuit sweetness. The sweetness is quickly overpowered by clove with alcohol underneath. As the clove subsides in the finish, alcohol becomes dominate.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"
986,"2015-06-27",3.2,"Draught at Methuselah, Pittsfield, 6/26/15Very lightly hazed light amber with some burnished copper highlights and a small, white head that recedes quickly to cover.Nicely phenolic nose starts things off peppery and dry while honey and vanilla emanate from the malt, balancing and creating a solid palette for the not-all-that-hoppy hop notes. They are indeed light and playful, adding bits of citrus, light red fruits and a touch of spicy/floral character. It works well, complementing, but not outdoing the yeast while no alcohol or flaws are apparent.Sweet, though not overly so, with soft, honey-like pils malt giving a slightly sticky texture that is then broken up by the dry estery/phenolic Belgian yeast and very minimal bitterness from the hops. Quite drinkable on account of the sweet, easygoing flavors, light wateriness and brisk carbonation. For a beer with the word hop in the name, its not all that hoppy, but for a lighthearted summer ale, it works. Maybe just a bit too much cake/icing sweetness on the finish, with slightly over-doughy maltiness bogging down the palate. Still, clean and drinkable, but the alcohol and tendency towards sweet/malty are a bit at odds with the lighter, hoppy summer session ale intentions here.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

 Served on tap in a fluted glass

 Appearance  The beer is served a hazy orange-yellow color with a nice thick one finger white head. The head has a good level of retention, fading slowly over time to leave a nice level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell- The aroma is a mix of fruit, wheat, and grass with a bit of yeast. The strong wheaty smell is mixed with fruits of orange and lemon with grassy and some floral notes rounding out the aroma along with a touch of yeast.

 Taste  The taste is wheaty and slightly yeasty up front with a moderate amount of orange citrus. The lemon citrus flavor develops more toward the middle of the taste with the wheat becoming more grainy in flavor as the taste advances further forward. The hops that were detected in the nose begin coming in more toward the middle of the taste with the grassy hop flavors starting off the hop entrance and the floral hop then coming in later. In the end a crisp and slightly sour lemon wheat flavor is left to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel- The body of the beer is on the lighter side in terms of thickness with a carbonation level that is slightly on the higher side with lots of little carbonation bubbles. Both are quite fitting for the style and make for a more refreshing feel on the tongue.

 Overall  A crisp, refreshing and flavorful brew. Very enjoyable and great for the summer weather.","","Darkmagus82"

986,"2014-08-17",4.5,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. The label lists the abv at 6.8 % abv and there is a nice short description of the beer. 
Appearance: The look of the body is cloudy and the color is a light golden hue. Its head is tall bright white in color and long lasting. It slowly settles to a thin creamy foam covering which leaves nice lace patterns on the glass. 
Smell: Fleur De Houblon has a classic Belgian character. Pale light grain with classic spicey Ommegang yeast mixed with some light citrusy, grassy and spicy hops. 
Taste / Palate: The nose and tongue are right on the same page. The base is light pale grain with white pepper and clove like spicy yeast. It also brings a light and pleasant Belgian funk/barnyard note to the mix. Hops add a touch of dryness and mild bitterness along with balanced grassy, floral and citrusy lemon flavor notes. The palate is on and very easy drinking. It feels smooth and creamy yet still lively with carbonation.

986,"2013-08-21",3.9,"A steady pour into my Sierra Nevada IPA glass produces a one finger thick, pale, off-white colored head. The beer is a nice gold color that shows a hazy, straw-gold hue when held up to the light. The aroma has a solid herbal / floral note and also has a yeast derived spiciness that leans towards earthy spices, clove, and perhaps a touch of coriander. Soft fruit notes of honey-dew melon, pear, and perhaps some kiwi like character are balanced by an almost woody pepper note, a musty herbal character, and a general woodiness towards the finish.

This has a spritzy carbonation to it, and is quite light bodied and refreshing on this hot summers day. There is a soft Meyer lemon zest character and hint of tartness up front, while an herbal and spicy character lingers throughout the palate. A soft, chewy grain character adds a nice, noticeable backbone to the flavor; it contributes notes of saltine crackers, straw like grain, and, along with the hops, a dried floral character that has lots of wildflower spiciness and grassy character to it. The grain character contributes a soft chewy sweetness that accentuates a green, ripe, fruit character that suggests at pears and melons perhaps.

This is quite nice and easy drinking, I love the mix of herbal / lemony hops, the pale grain character and the characterful yeast character. Once again I find I am a sucker for beers that are nicely hoppy, and not so high in alcohol, that it gets in the way of the dance of malt, hop, and yeast character. In the end this is far more tasty than I was expecting.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

986,"2013-07-10",4.2,"Pours hazy and pale. The color of gentle, golden rays of sunshine. A tall billowing head of foam that falls ever so slowly and never quite leaves because of all the streaming effervescence. Leaves plenty of soapy lace and a thick cap and ring. Nose is like rain. First because there are tiny bubbles jumping out of the glass but also because its lush with floral and citrus perfume. Theres Belgian yeast and spice, a bit of pepper, lemon, lime and light banana. Theres a touch of clove and light green apple. The malt is pale. Cracker and light honey. Sweet and tempting alongside the fruit. Golden wheat. It drinks like the nose. Sparkling clean, and a travels the palate with style. All that fruit in perfect harmony with the spices. The yeast a touch sour, the citrus a bit tart but sweet overall, like a bushel of ripe fruits. The balance is perfection as all the aspects come together in their complexity to from a drink that is simple and pure goodness. The cracker and wheat are dry in the finish and the hops, which have been shy until just now peek their heads out. They have contributed a powerful floral  perfume and in the finish they leave just a small and delicate bitter. Finishes dry. 

Ommegang never fails to delight and this is a refreshing and well made summer ale that will quench your thirst and delight the palate. Elegant yet earthy. The citrus makes your mouth water and then the apple quenches your thirst. The hops are gentle to the drink and accentuate the fruit , especially the lime.

986,"2013-07-05",3.7,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 4/10/13 and cost $3.99 ($0.33 per ounce).

Appearance: A bright yellow, akin to a lemon skin. Cloudy, but plenty of visible carbonation. Forms a huge, bright white, fluffy head similar to Duvel. It retains and laces quite well.

Smell: Classic Belgian yeast esters, plus flowers, a hint of spice, and some citrus.

Taste: The best way to sum up Ommegang Fleur de Houblon would be a cross between a Belgian pale ale and an American pale ale. Its got the base Belgian character down pat: the yeast character with its esters and spicy flavors, along with significant (but restrained) hop flavor and bitterness. 

The palette begins like a lot of standard Belgian pale ales (or ""singles""): dry bitterness, some lemon zest and fruit flavors, followed by true hop character at the apex. The label indicates its ""hopped to perfection"" with whole cone Bravo hops, but if youre expecting an all-out hop bomb you may be a bit disappointed. The hops here add a light flowery component as well as some dry spicy character as well. I get a hint of ground black pepper on the finish, plus a bit more lemon rind or grains of paradise sort of taste (though its nowhere near being a generic American pale wheat ale).

Drinkability:. The mouthfeel is classic Belgian in every way with fine, scrubbing carbonation bubbles, though its pretty easy to get down. While Fleur de Houblon is rather bitter and dry, it does leave a fairly clean aftertaste, though I wouldnt describe it as a refreshing beer per se. Im not sure why they opted for a hefty weight of 6.8% ABV, but then again Ommegang rarely brews small, sessionable beers, so I guess a summer seasonal from them would be rather strong (thankfully, it doesnt feel or drink like something that big).","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

986,"2013-05-11",3.5,"5/11/13. 12oz bottle from Grassroots. Hazy golden pour with a small off-white head. Light floral, earthy hop presence in the aroma with dusty malts and definite fruity Belgian yeast. Dry, slightly bitter flavor, but with a sweet fruity, malty and yeast middle. Lingering floral hops, bitterness, and grainy malts. Not bad.","Georgia, USA","drowland"

986,"2013-05-04",3.6,"Pour is a cloudy blonde with a ginormus white head.  Aroma is a nice hoppy floral with a bit of citrus.  Flavor is Belgian esters with a nice green hop.  After the swallow comes a bit of spicyness.  This was a fine Belgian ale.  Plenty of flavor and the carbonation was not as bad as I thought.  Easy drinking summer ale.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
986,"2013-05-01",4.1,"12oz bottle poured into a small Duvel glass.  Even the first half of the bottle pours very cloudy with a big thick head.  Good head retention with a decent lacing.  Color is yellowy golden.  Aroma is strong on floral hops, stingy and then lots of strong Belgian yeast (airy, doughy).  Aroma bottom line: spiky floral-hop-airy-doughness.   Flavor very similar, a bit collapsed with less individualized on each of those elements.  A bit of light-moderate bitterness rounds it off.  Thicker mouthfeel with ample felt carbonation.  I really liked this, for a hoppy Belgian its right up my alley.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
986,"2013-05-01",2.8,"Pours a hazy golden orange with a large bubbly white head that left spotty lacing.  Aroma of chouffe yeast, floral, citrus and soap.  Flavor was very soapy to me.  Lots of flowers...and I guess I just dont dig that in my beers.  Has that classic chouffe yeast profile.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
986,"2013-05-01",3.7,"Bottle. Poured cloudy yellow color with an average to large frothy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate to heavy floral, fruit and yeast aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy spice sweet flavor with a medium spice sweet finish of moderate duration. I would recommend this to a friend.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
986,"2013-04-29",3.3,"Smell is very earthy and belgiany.  It is really refreshing and light. Not a ton of Belgian flavor, has a little bit of spicyness, pretty dry.  A solid summer beer

Very floral and notes of citrus - hop flavor doesnt end bitter but rounds out nice with the belgian yeast.  Perfect for a summer day.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","falco242"

Very nice! Has a bit of bread on the tongue with a light hoppiness. Finishes clean. Love Ommegang and this is why.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"
986,"2013-04-26",3.5,"12oz bottle - pours deep gold with honey cloudiness, huge white head and spotty lacing.  Nose is yeast and grass.  Flavor adds saison-like spiciness.

986,"2013-04-22",4.2,"Pours a hazy bright yellow with a massive white fluffy head that threatens to top the glass even with the gentlest pour.  Great retention and lacing.  The aroma is immediately bubblegum and Belgian yeast with lemon and underlying hints of barnyard.  The taste is exactly what I wanted with the floral hops, lemon and a bit of sweetness from the malt.  The yeast adds to the complexity with some spiciness and a little funk, ending with a subdued bitterness that fades away.  Mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing with a somewhat creamy body and medium/high carbonation that helps make the beer finish dry.  This could very well be my go to summer beer as indicated on the bottle.  Delicious and very drinkable and Belgian Pale Ales are quickly becoming my favorite style.

986,"2013-04-21",3.5,"On tap. Uniformly hazy yellow-orange color. Good thin white head, with great retention. It just stays. Leaves nice lace. Pretty good-looking beer. Belgian yeast aroma evident in the nose, but the flavor is satisfyingly hoppy. Good floral hop notes, some fresh fruit. Pretty refreshing flavor profile. Medium-plus body. Good, smooth carbonation. Just a light bitter taste, light bit of tart. Pretty good belgian pale ale. Smooth, easy to drink, refreshing, and satisfyingly hoppy. I dont usually care much for the style, but this is a solid belgian pale ale.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
986,"2013-04-21",3.4,"Draft to taster. Looks solid; a hazy gold with white lacing. Smells yeasty and doughy with some hops. Tastes like it smells, only better, and with a more notable hop presence. Nice on the palate. Enjoyable.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
