Dark ruddy-brown, almost no head. Very heady aroma, Anna maps it onto glue, but for me its just heady, not solventy. Plenty of grainy malts. Simple grainy malty body too, flat and dead feel, not so good. Rich enough to cover the alcohol, but thats about as positive as I can be, its not totally covered. Taking a big sip, you do get a ton of esters, quite heady, and some sense of the alcohol, but you also get a fuller nutty and bitter experience. Better, but scarier. Once its warmed even a bit the alcohol burn ramps up quite scarily - woof!","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
