Gravicask at GBBF. Superb looking beer. Dark dark brown with an awesome tan head. Tip top condition. Lovely raspberry tinged old ale aroma with some delicate smoky malt underneath. Bags of fruityness and a delicate sour note. Flavour follows on well from the aroma but is not quite so complex. Very slightly thin in the palate but still has a nice feel. Drinks above its strength.

3512,"2005-09-08",4.0,"Cask (gravity dispense), Chelmsford Beer Festival, July 2005. A beer that is very hard to classify, style-wise. Its down as a mild, but Duff and I both noted intense fruity notes. So fruity, in fact, that I contacted the brewer to find out whether there is any fruit added. He confirmed there is some fruit in it, but raspberries (not a huge amount), rather than the blackcurrants that I guessed. He also said that it had appeared on the Cambridge Festival list as Forest Mild but he didnt know why. He didnt really think it was a mild either, but didnt really know what style to call it. But with a beer this good, style is irrelevant. Rich, deep ruby colour. Intense cassis aroma. Subtly sharp and yeasty in an almost Belgian style. Some tart cherry character. Also some dark chocolate and roasty malt. Good grip - not sweet, not blowsy. Very succulent. Lingering, fruity aftertaste. Superb stuff.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
