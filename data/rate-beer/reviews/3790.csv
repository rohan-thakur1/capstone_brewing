Pours a thick, tiny bubbled, well retained, beige head, over a clear, dark brown (SRM 25) body.....nose is heavy banana/bubblegum, light cocoa, hints of chocolate, no hops, balance to the yeast........taste is slightly sweet, with very heavy banana/bubblegum, barest hints of clove, from the yeast, cocoa, chocolate from the roasted malts, finishing almost dry with minimal hop additions....mouth feel, medium, sticky, light alcohol warmth, carbonation adds creaminess. This is a very yeast dominated confection, with the banana/bubblegum, quite light clove notes, almost overwhelming the other backbones of malt and hops.

3790,"2012-10-03",3.5,"From notes, 12/18/11:

Served on-tap at the brewery into the complimentary Ugly Pug Pint Glass.

A: Medium-to-dark brown with lighter hues around the edges. Poured with no head, and therefore, no lacing.

S: Fruity yeast upfront - banana & also some bubble-gum. Sweet, but not cloying, wheat malts and a bit of caramel.

T: Banana, caramel, and mild hop bitterness.

M: I only have Vitus to compare as far as the style; this was a bit thinner, but not by much.

O: Really enjoyed this one fresh at the brewery. They only tapped one keg and it went fairly quick: wanted a second pint, but it had already kicked. Will look for this in bottle.","Austin, Texas, USA","videofrog"
