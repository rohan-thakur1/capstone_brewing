2335,"2016-06-10",3.4,"From notes. Enjoyed this one at the Brew Crew Bash in Ann Arbor on May 21. This one was poured from a 750 mL bottle. The pour is a darker fuzzy golden orange with a pretty thick and effervescent off-white colored head that roils down pretty quickly. There are some decent soapy legs left on the glass. The aroma is complex, and strange. There is a strong grapefruit zest up front, but then it fades through a strange Belgian influenced yeast and malt. There is a strong earthiness and a defined spiciness. Its almost like a bright, Belgian champagne. Im not digging it. The flavor mimics this. There is a grapey presence at the front, and then the Belgian yeast and malts just move in. The spicy malt is definitely a turn off here. Its vinous and has a light hop on the back end. Its weird. The mouth feel is a little thinner, but the big champagne carbonation is something I dont care for. I know theyre going to something like it, but Im not too keen. The aftertaste is spicy and malty with a hint of acidic citrus. Interesting beer, but its not my thing.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Very smooth and easy to drink, despite the hop bitterness and high strength. Alcohol is masked well. The hops have a lovely cheesey, cat urine taste/aroma to them (seriously). Lots of good flavours overall. There is just something very slightly unbalanced about it which would stop me from saying that this is perfect.

>>> Fantastic wine-forward Belgian Strong Ale with a nice fruitiness added by the Riesling grapes. As good as the regular version. 

+  Like the ""regular"" version, this is one of the most ""wine forward"" beer I have ever tasted 
+  The addition of Riesling grapes to an already winey beer makes an interesting result, especially with the aroma where it gave a super perfumy grapes profile
 
+  While its really complex, its also rather drinkable for an 9% abv beer.

Pour a clear dark amber, with a small white head. 
Aroma definately has some barrel to it, sith some woody tanins to it. Grape peel, apple skin, faint apple juice, slight grass, weak hop aromas, the white stuff between the fruit and the peel of an orange. Taste is somewhat sweet up front, with some bitter notes to it. Ever so slight sour notes somewhere in the mix. Surprisingly full and sticky body, with a rather flat carbonation. I quite like this.","Aalborg, DENMARK","MotherBrother"
