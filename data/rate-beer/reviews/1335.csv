1335,"2017-02-18",2.8,"Nice peaty aroma that very clearly gave away the Islay scotch heritage. As to the flavor? Oh my word! This has to be one of the most undrinkable barrel-aged beers Ive ever had. Felt like I had taken a mouthful of peat. Absolutely killed my taste buds for the rest of the evening. Make sure that if you include this on your tasting flight that its the very last one. Perhaps itll be better after being laid down for a while.","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"

1335,"2017-01-25",2.9,"Overall, I have to agree with BeerLogic below. A very strange and rather undrinkable beer. Most people familiar with peat smoked beers know how offensive they can be, but this one ups the ante at 11.3% ABV! Whoa. Talk about palate overload. With that said, the adventurous side of me cant help but appreciate the fact that this beer smells and tastes like no other beer Ive experienced in all my thousands of samples. It pours a very dark amber color with a tan head. The aroma is massive smoky, earthy, dirty peat. Tons of Islay whiskey barrel. Maybe the most potent peat smell Ive experienced outside of a single malt Scotch. The flavor is incredibly dirty, phenolic and smoky with charred wood and distant notes of dark fruity plum and caramel. Low bitterness and oily on the palate. Pretty offensive really, but something Ill remember for a while, so it gets points for that. Drinker beware though.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
1335,"2017-01-15",0.8,"Scotch/Scottish ale flavors and aromas non existent as this is so peat smokey that all you taste is the flavors of a hot fire put out by cold water... smoke, smoke and more smoke. Resembles nothing of a rauch bier... its liquid smoke. Buy a bottle... not of this beer, but liquid smoke and youll be able to check it in on untappd. 

Love Sierra Nevada and appreciate people liking different beers, but I cant embrace this, especially for the price. I love you Sierra Nevada, but I cant give you love on this one.","","BeerLogic"
1335,"2017-01-02",3.7,"Bottle shared by bhensonb. Pours dark brown with a thick tan head and a smoky aroma. There is a hearty caramel malt flavor with a lot of smoke and a lot of scotch.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
1335,"2016-12-30",4.0,"750 c&c from the Chico SN brewery gift shop. Pours brown with a tan head. Aroma is very peaty. Med ++ body. Flavor is peat, wood, and some not easy to pick out caramel. It is much less peaty than the Stone Uncut. Thats good for me. Its not exactly dry, and the peat takes the place of hop. As earlier review stated, you need to like peat to really, really like this ale. Reminds of Brew Dog Paradox IS ales.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1335,"2016-12-30",4.2,"Tawny pour. Big smoke aroma and flavor, not boozy - but very assertive scotch smoke and sweetish malt. Really really nice if youre a big peated scotch fan, probably way over the top of youre not - like Stones scotch bastard, with a little more restraint.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
1335,"2016-12-25",2.1,"Bottle from the source - Im not liking this one at all. I get the barrel aging, but it is dominated by medicinal, toothpaste like after taste that I just cant abid.","Virginia, USA","magsinva"
1335,"2016-12-24",4.0,"Bottle from Sierra Nevada Mills River. Pours Coca Cola brown with an inch of khaki foam. Lots of wood barrel notes on the nose. Rich and malty on the tongue with a fair amount of scotch. Hides its booze well. Nice.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"
1335,"2016-12-18",5.0,"Faced with slightly declining sales, Sierra Nevada has responded by taking some risks, creating ""nichier"" beers like Tropical Torpedo. This beer is even nichier...it literally wreaks of peat from Islay (pronounced ""eye-la"" in Gaelic, I believe) Scotch whisky barrels. If you love Islay single malt as much as I do, youre going to love this beer. As you drink it, some of the fog burns off. But theres still plenty of smoke left when your glass is empty...heavenly stuff! Would love to compare this with Harviestoun Ola Dubh.","Mountain View, California, USA","dpitinga"
