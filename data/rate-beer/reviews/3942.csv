3942,"2017-03-09",4.0,"On draft at Mermaid Tavern in Tampa. The pour is a darker foggy golden orange color with a thicker white head and a good lace as it falls. The aroma is beautiful. There is a heavy tart strawberry throughout. There is a light banana and this almost smells like a damn tart smoothie, its spectacular. The flavor is just as good. Tart crisp strawberry and a light banana on the finish. Its a lightly wheaty tart smoothie. I cant get over it. The mouth feel is a little heavier and still crisp with a softer carbonation and a lingeringly tart strawberry finish. This is great. One of the better strawberry sours out there.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
