Slightly bland aroma with bready yeast, light fruit and faint floral hops. Theres a touch of grassy hops along with some apple, pear, bread and biscuit. 

Fuller bodied than expected and a lot more interesting than the nose suggests. Subtle crisp hop bite up front with some grassy saaz flavor along with some hay, subtle earthy resins and pine needle. This is followed by bready yeast and sweet light fruit notes, notably apple and pear. Not terribly complex but well balanced, crisp, refreshing and decently drinkable.

My first sample was a pint of the Biere de Garde. Nicely done this was a decent example of the style. I dont know how Bells can brew across so many different styles so well. However they do it I know the chances of being disappointed are very slim when I get a chance to try something new.

Aroma / Appearance - Carbonated golden bubbles sparkled like champagne. A clean white head shine like a spotlight above the surface. Hay, wheat, yeast, and other aromas feel like sitting sitting on a farm as a summer breeze blows across the fields.

Flavor / Palate - Wheat, hay which has been trampled flat, and cereal grains mix into a summery haze. A little bit of alcohol leaks through in the finish. This is very balanced and had there not been other exceptional choices this would have made a solid go to for the rest of the evening.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
