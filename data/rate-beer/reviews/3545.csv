3545,"2016-05-15",4.0,"750 ml bottle to snifter (thanks Ferris). Looks good; a very cloudy apricot with fluffy eggshell head. Smells good too: tart, funky, and mildly lactic with LOADS of Amarillo in the backbone. Tastes like it smells with some salt and a fairly lively, juice-like medium-bodied mouthfeel. Tasty!","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
3545,"2015-09-09",3.5,"Pours a hazy golden orange with no head. Aroma of citrus, sour wheat, oak and funk. Taste follows, very sour vinegar, oak wheat and funk.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","jcartamdg"
3545,"2015-07-25",3.4,"Bottle. Muddy peach fuzz hue with very little head. Aroma is pure Amarillo: lemon peel, hay, fresh cut grass. Flavor has more gose tartness and salinity, with fruity Amarillo-based pineapple, sunflower, grass and pear laced in. Acidity is huge, taking the enamel off my teeth. Very little carbonation; medium body. Nice use of Amarillo, but the sourness is a little overbearing.","","PartyFowle"
3545,"2015-07-24",4.0,"The beer is a yellowish tan color. Clouded over entirely. Medium white head, fairly fizzy. Little to no lacing. The aroma is oranges, lemons, pineapple, mango on top of a laco sourness. Maybe a touch of spice lurking in the background. Big, juicy citrus sourness. I think theres some coriander. Mild salty tang. Very good balance of sweet fruity flavors and lactic acidity. Its refreshing and easy to drink. Medium body with a decent pucker at the finish. Lingering citrus flavor. Very enjoyable.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Hoppy, lots of coriander, lemon, lemon peel, salty, lactic yoghurt. Taste is tart and salty, light, crisp and tasty. Same spices here as well. Nice, but didnt live up to the aroma, which is almost like grape soda! High carbonation and a light and crisp body.","Aarhus C, DENMARK","Vestergaard"

3545,"2015-07-01",4.1,"Poured from a bottle. Aroma has a light acidity with some medium light citrus notes. Quite a bit of pineapple with some mango and peach. Very fruity with some light, pale malt notes. Pours a hazy, pale golden straw with a medium high, fairly thick, white head that slowly recedes to the edges then lingers as a thin film. Low lacing and small legs. Flavor is somewhat sweet with a balanced acidity as well. Lots of pineapple with lighter grapefruit, orange and mango notes. Faint peach and stone fruit with low bitterness. Low malt notes. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringnecy and low alcohol warmth. Overall, a yummy beer with a lot of hop flavor and aroma. Very fruity with nice malt notes and balanced acidity. I love these dry hopped goses from de Garde.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Pours hazy whitish blond with low-medium white head. Aroma is of spices, tea, herbs, leaves. Taste is of citrus, fruits, acid, leaves. Palate: Light body. Medium carbonation. Overall: A tad too acid for the stomach. Pretty nice beer.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","Minderbinder"
3545,"2015-05-30",4.0,"Bottle (750 ml). From kcherney, thanks! Split with the Québec crew.

Appearance: Cloudy yellow with a small white head, surprisingly good retention for the style and little lacing. 

Aroma: Less intense and way more balanced than the Citra version we had just before. Its still quite citric and zesty, but theres a pleasant grassy presence, mild oak features and light spiciness. 

Taste: Also citric, zesty and quite tart with grassy presence, oak, mild salty notes and hints of coriander. 

Palate: Light body (feels a bit lighter than the Citra version). Medium carbonation. Rather dry. Citric, coriander and mild saltiness in the finish. 

Overall: The best from the Hose series so far. Its quite citric and zesty, but it remains super drinkable and enjoyable. One of the good De Garde so far. Tasty stuff.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
3545,"2015-05-29",3.7,"Pours a cloudy yellow with a thin white head that leaves some/low lacing. Nose is of acid fruits, a little gastric acid and grass. Taste is citrusy and indeed really tart, not quite bracingly so but really pushing my limit. Still, really refreshing because of that so its all OK. Body is light, carbonation moderate. Overall a simple but good gose, I think I preferred the Citra version though.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
