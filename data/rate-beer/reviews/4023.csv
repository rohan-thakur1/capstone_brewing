4023,"2015-09-14",3.9,"Its funny reading through the comments of all these TH IPAs - all peachy and mangoey, all citrusy and pineapply - all good, and all different to each drinker, although RateBeer could probably disperse various TH IPA descriptions among various IPAs and not notice. This one has a touch of orange drink in it to me - truly juicy. I tried 6 pale ales/IPAs on my most recent visit, and this was probably the best, although my ratings are all more or less the same.",", New Jersey, USA","pressboxjoe"

4023,"2015-05-12",4.2,"Growler: Thanks, Steve. Light-straw body with a cloudy haze throughout. Big, bright white head caps things off nicely, mild lacing left behind. Beautiful aroma of pineapple, orange, mango, grapefruit, pungent hop oils, pine needles, mild resin, a small hint of florals, & just a kiss of back-end dankness. Only a touch of pale cracker malt in the flavor, allowing the onslaught of hops to stand out even more. Bitter pine, lupulin oils, dry florals, fresh pineapple, tangerine peel, mango, grapefruit rind, a touch of green onion & freshly cut grass in the finish. Lingers with a kiss of lightly sweet pale malt, perfume, & juicy tangerine. Dry, thirst quenching. Delicious pale ale, super impressed by this... Fantastic stuff.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

4023,"2013-07-18",4.2,"Served on-tap at the brewpub. Reviewed from notes.


A - Pours pale yellow with a frothy one finger tall white head leaving small trails of lace down part of the glass.


S - Smells of super fresh clementine pulp and zest, juicy citric hops, grass and some pale malt. The nose is incredible on this one.


T - Starts off with the intense citric hop bitterness quickly giving way to the strong clementine fruitiness, chewy pale malt and some of the fresh cut grass. Finish is a touch chewy with plenty of hop bitterness, not lingering on the palate for very long at all.


M - Medium-Light body with moderate carbonation. Smooth, chewy feel with plenty of bitterness. 


O - I have had both batches of this one and both have been excellent. It remains one of my favorite Tired Hands beers to date. One of my favorite APAs to date.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

4023,"2013-04-14",4.0,"On tap at TH.  Pours a beautiful straw/light yellow.  Filtered but with a touch of yeast.  An inch or so of light white head which dissipates into almost nothing.  Aroma of peach, lemon and grass.  Mouthfeel is very light.  Not really crisp, but very light and smooth and bright.  Taste is dry and citrusy.  Lots of lemon, pear, peach, mild grapefruit rind and orange.  A fantastic APA that drinks perfectly over and over again.","Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","dagimp"

Simple, crisp and clean.  Juicy medium body with a soft, sexy tingle.  Finishes crisp, dry and pithy.  Taste is the same clementine and pine with the zest adding a beautiful bitter note more hoppy than citrus.

4023,"2013-03-19",3.5,"UPDATED: APR 22, 2013 Re-rate 32 oz growler... The clementines seem to come through much more in this batch... or maybe its the smaller, flip-top growler that did a better job of preserving the beers freshness and subsequent fruitiness. Although a bit thin, this is an enjoyable and thirst-quenching pale ale. Super bright and refreshing with energetic carbonation. Fresh growler courtesy of a very generous boamr!

Original rating
64oz Growler... Cloudy light yellow pour with no head. The nose furnishes fruity hops and clementine accompanied by a rumor of musky, funky hops. Light-bodied with modest carbonation. The flavor is perfectly-balanced, mildly fruity and stupid drinkable. However, all-in-all, this brew is fairly bland with a short, crisp, clean finish. Flawless, but unremarkable. Big-time thanks to landhoney for sharing this ridiculously refreshing pale ale with the South Florida Brew Crew!Original score = 3.2","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
4023,"2013-02-08",4.1,"Growler: The aroma consists of moderate-heavy citrus, pineapple, light grapefruit, and grass. It pours a hazy dull yellow with a one finger white head.

Its light bodied with moderate carbonation.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
4023,"2013-02-07",3.9,"Draft at the brewpub after the Hand Farm release. Poured a rather ugly super cloudy milky straw gold with an average sized foamy white head. Aroma is JUICY, loads of citrus pulp and some rind along with slight toast and grassy hops. Smooth body overall with light carbonation and average to lighter carbonation. Flavor is much like the aroma with a slight addition of lightly buttered popcorn hiding behind loads of juicy citrus fruits. Great stuff.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"

4023,"2013-01-30",4.3,"Pours a hazy golden yellow straw color with nice thin white head. Doesnt seem to stick around much though.

The color of the beer was unlike any I have seen, really did resemble a murky mountain dew as another reviewer stated. Aromas and taste of light grapefruit, clementines, and other zesty orange notes. Not getting much Nelson out of it, but i do detect some amarillo. Well carbonated, lighter bodied. I liked this one but not as much as others did. Re-rate, this newer batch is killer, all kinds of fruit juice and hop notes, more balanced and juiced out this time around. Liking this hop juice.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
4023,"2013-01-23",4.1,"Growler thanks to GT2! Pour looks about as close to Mountain Dew as any beer Ive seen other than maybe Magic Ghost.

Maybe the beer needed some time to settle. Anyway--pours a pale yellowish orange straw with a thin film of mildly sticky white lace.  Nose is fresh citrus, lots of lemon and lime, clementines are evident. The Nelson Sauvin hops really stand out but so does the Clementine juice and zest. Flavor is more orange juice, lemon, lime, light toffee.  Finishes zesty, bitter and juicy, with a soft creaminess that works surprisingly well.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

Finish is insane: whipped cream, pineapple, key lime, bitter orange rind. Tastes like liquid key lime pie. Easy 4.2 level APA but Im digging this super soft, fresh key lime pie flavor.
