Smells like a common coffee roast - think Colombian. Oh my, this beer goes beyond to meet my expectations. The palate is clean and silky. Initial flavors are of husky grains and coffee, then dark-chocolate and mild pepper come out during the follow through. A nice refreshing coffee infused cream ale. My experience is limited with these beers using coffee as a flavoring to golden and pale ale beers, but gotta say it seems best with styles that are not too hop forward. Victory and Modist do good takes using coffee in their golden brews.","","balloonbuffoon"

The taste is coffee up front, smooth and creamy, a bit of malt, grass, coffee is really the only flavor that stands out here, the cream ale they used is a bit too thin to support such a robust flavor.

432,"2017-02-26",4.0,"Bottle. Nose has some Smarties / sweet-tart fruity esters that hang around before the damp coffee rises and muddles; theres light nuttiness and pale roast, seemingly also some cream (though Im not getting that from the style or name). Pour rich golden just leaning toward glowing orange, clear with average carbonation and a noisy, hissing beige head that fizzes itself out. Taste medium sweet and never cloying, lots more of that pseudo-cream character, even lactose, with some pale coffee but not too much (more of a feel thing) and generic but significant fruity esters, dash of honey, brief and surprising warm-bready finish. Crisp and refreshing, bit of a chalky swipe on the tongue that I dont like, though I wouldnt call it astringency or over-mineralization, low bitterness, mild alcohol warmth, and lots of clean maltiness to make some lagerheads jealous. The subtle graininess is more like hops than coffee, though I cant tell its source, and if you close your eyes, you can imagine a little porter character, as well. Holds true to self: a textbook cream ale with appropriate coffee accent rather than a coffee-based beer fermented warm.  Really a fun one to unpack, has a little bit of a lot of things.
