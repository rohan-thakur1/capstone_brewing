3750,"2017-02-25",2.7,"Weizen Bock dun blond paille (EBC aux alentours de 15), parée dun léger voile et surmontée dune mousse blanche dun centimètre dépaisseur provenant dune multitude de fines bulles très jolies en verre, cette Weihenstephaner Vitus se démarque malheureusement surtout par son côté douceâtre la rendant à la longue écurante et par son manque de complexité la rendant peu intéressante. Au nez, cest le blé, la coriandre et la banane relevés dune pointe citronnée qui se révèlent. Lattaque est plutôt bien réussie, suave, sur des arômes fruités et fleuris, mais bien équilibrée par une légère présence houblonnée. Dès la deuxième bouche, sur une présence très sucrée, les arômes se font plus lourds en bouche avec, à cet instant des notes de miel et dépices douces. La troisième bouche laisse quant à elle sexprimer lamertume sur la retenue tout de même avec un faible IBU de 17 et des arômes de céréales. Larrière bouche par chance est un peu plus fraîche sur des notes fleuries. Lalcool, malgré un titrage de 7,7 % Abv, ne se fait absolument pas sentir tant le niveau de sucre est élevé. Ce manque de présence de lalcool couplé à une amertume peu développée ne permet aucun essor des arômes et mène sur un final toujours sur la douceur, un brin épicé et des arômes de banane. Les quelques notes acidulées surprenantes, ne permettront même pas de faire oublier la bouche pâteuse en fin de dégustation. En conclusion, si vous êtes amateurs de boissons très sucrées et simples, cette Weihenstephaner Vitus vous plaira très certainement. Ceci nest pas mon cas....","FRANCE","jybi"

Im surprised that it took me so long to get around to this, but Im sure glad I did; while it probably doesnt replace Aventinus among commonly-available examples of the style, its a good competitor and I suspect Ill be getting a few more this fall.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

A slight hint of banana as well, which is what makes this one of my favorite german beers. Its light-medium bodied, with a nice bit of sweetness from the malt.

The taste is a bright, medium high sweet and medium bitter combination. The beers texture is creamy and thick, smooth, with a soft fuzz carbonation and a medium full body. Flvaors of lemon, clove, banana, and a hint alcohol hit the palate first, and it finishes crisp with a lemon and orange acidity and a zippy spice.

3750,"2015-05-07",4.7,"16.9 oz bottle, poured into a tulip glass at ~45 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a somewhat cloudy (fingers visible but blurry on the opposite side of the glass) brilliant golden yellow, and forms a massively fluffy white head that barely collapses even when drunk - I dont know that it ever went below a half-finger in height, with appropriately off-the-chain lacing. Carbonation streams continuously through the beer as tiny bubbles.

Smell: Pure ester heaven. Rich notes of banana and clove swell out of the glass, with hints of coriander, peaches, and lush ripe wheat.

Taste: Coriander citrus opens the flavor profile, and is swiftly joined by banana and spicy clove. A spot of peach flavor enters as it moves along, and bits of white pepper emerge at close to the same time. Underlying it all is a light biscuit-cracker malt, which comes more to the front at the finish, leaving behind a lingering mixture of wheaten malt, banana, and peach after the swallow.

Mouthfeel: Light-bodied yet silky, this is an easy-drinking beer, not unlike the feel of a good hefeweizen.

Overall: Less ""imperial dunkelweizen"" and more ""imperial hefeweizen"", this is definitely what one would expect from Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Turbo Edition. Im quite the fan, though ultimately I give the nod to Tap 6 Aventinus for Best Weizenbock Ever.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

3750,"2014-08-22",4.1,"Transfer from BA review on 1-10-13-
 Served on tap in a pint glass

 Appearance Served a hazy golden-yellow colored brew with a one finger thick white head. The head fades slowly to leave a great level of lacing.

 Smell - The aroma is a mix of wheat and yeast with a light citrus smell, consisting mostly a mix of orange and a lighter lemon smell. With these aromas are notes of coriander and clove as well as some banana smells. 

 Taste The taste has many of the flavors that were detected in the nose. It starts out wheaty and bready with a moderate yeasty taste upfront. A sweeter citrus flavor also greets the tongue initially almost entirely orange in nature. The citrus flavor lessens some more toward the middle of the taste while flavors of banana, coriander and clove come to the tongue. These flavors take the taste to its end where an almost candy/bubblegum like sweetness joins the flavor as well as a very light alcohol taste, leaving a nice sweet wheat banana bready flavor to be left on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel The body of the brew is on the slightly thicker and chewier side with a carbonation level that is on the slightly higher side as well. The chewier body is quite nice for the wheaty flavors while the carbonation is very nice for keeping it drinkable and for accentuating the spice and fruit flavors of the brew. 

 Overall  It is kind of like a souped up hefeweizen or maybe like a hefenweizen-grand cru hybrid. It is great tasting and potent but very drinkable. Rather well done.","","Darkmagus82"

3750,"2013-07-21",3.9,"(bottle) Pours a hazy yellow with a towering white head that retains for quite a long time and leaves significant lacing. Based on appearance alone, one would guess that this is a regular hefe. Aroma holds all of the characteristic components of a solid weizenbock. The bananas are here in spades, mostly of the dried stripe, with further scents of yeast, light vanilla, clove, and some cinnamon all come into play. Think I got some peppermint too and something that reminded me of floor cleaner. Shades of Dancing Man. The flavor is also nicely done, and continues the dried banana theme, with further flavors of baked bread, clove, and tart wheat that really shears off the finish and makes it crisp. Alcohol is only subtly perceived. Mouthfeel is full and creamy and the carbonation is lively. Overall this is a quality weizenbock.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

3750,"2013-06-12",3.9,"Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle into a Weihenstephaner Vitus chalice. 

Vitus pours a dark and cloudy golden straw color. A frothy off-white foam matures gracefully as I pour the bottle, never quite reaching the cusp of the glass. 

The nose on this is like an imperial version of their hefeweizen - bold and crisp (at least by 500 year old German brewing standards), with a bouquet of banana, clove, and light fruity esters. No dark fruit in this Weizenbock, though.

Banana sweetness and clove spiciness really dominate the flavor of this beer. A syrupy honey sweetness comes into play first, with the banana and clove coming in next, and then there is a long, slow finish as the beer tries to diminish the sweetness. The finish is a bit drier than the start, but it is still a rather sweet beer.

There is a light and crisp feel to the beer from the carbonation with a little bit of syrupy sweetness on the back end. Overall the mouthfeel is very clean, though. There is no residual sweetness on the lips or tongue after each sip. 

I think the regular Hefeweizen is the better beer; it still packs a flavor punch but has a lower ABV and the mouthfeel is a bit superior. Still, it is not surprising that this beer is quite drinkable. I could have a few glasses of this anytime.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

3750,"2013-04-01",3.3,"16.9 oz bottle. Nicely labelled. Served in a weissbier glass at a temperature of about 45F. . 

Pours a pale golden color with a slight haze. A lot of mixed-size carbonation is apparent in the rising bubbles. The massive off-white head is remarkably thick, has great retention, and leaves batches of sudsy lacing clinging to the glass. The aroma is yeasty and bready, with a strong but not overwhelming amount of cloves and banana. The flavor is a bit stronger than the aroma, although the qualities are about what I expected after sniffing it. Mildly sweet thanks to some nice tartness from mid-taste on. Remarkably well hidden alcohol; drinks like ~ 3% ABV!

Good feel albeit a bit too thin  Not fizzy or too lively despite what looks like generous carbonation.

Appearance: A towering fluffy white head explodes on the pour with great retention. The head towers over a murky golden body. This is a great looking beer, it just takes a bit to settle down.
Aroma: The yeast is strong providing banana and spice aromas. Supporting the yeast is a slightly sweet doughy aroma. The aroma is a bit muddled, but smells great regardless.
Taste: This is complex throughout the sip. On the intro the malts provide a sweetness to this, a touch of caramel, while apples and banana come through during the mid taste. The finish adds a touch of spice, very mild.
Palate: Medium bodied with a creamy full texture, soft carbonation.

3750,"2012-12-27",4.3,"Reviewed 10/30/2012. Thanks to Momar42 for the bottle! About 10 oz poured into a pint glass.

A: Pours a very cloudy amber color. The head is a two finger off white shade with one of the most beautiful general textures Ive seen in a head before. Shame the lacing is low, though.

S: I half expected bananarama, and thats what I got. What sends it over the top is the complex notes of tangerine, cloves, bubblegum, and light grass intermingling with the banana that turns it into a real aromatic winner.

T: This takes what made Weihenstephaners hefeweizen so great, and amps it up to 11. Light banana to start, before giving way to some earthy, wheaty notes. I love how it isnt overly sweet (a problem I found in both Ayingers and Schneiders weizenbocks) The finishing flavor, in particular, is superbly wheat forward. It manages to be balanced, smooth, and complex all at the same time,

M: I only have one problem with the beer - the finish is just too astringent and chalky. The smooth, slick body is excellent right up until then, however. The carbonation, just like the texture, is fantastically controlled up until the midtaste, but is also a little too intrusive on the back end. However, both tighten up quite well after several sips.

O: An excellent beer in general - but not quite as great as the regular hefeweizen. To be fair, thats one of the best beers *ever* in my opinion, so it makes me a little sad that this is merely fantastic, rather than utterly transcendental. But still, the fact that its gotten to a point where Im chiding a beer for only being excellent means that Vitus should be searched out and consumed immediately.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

It has a creamy hay aroma but I?m not convinced by the word banana to describe this. It doesn?t seem at all sweet, but has an appreciable bitterness and that distinct wheat-y sourness. It?s a strong, full bodied drink with a satisfyingly thick texture, plenty of fizz and a bitter, slightly sour aftertaste. Overall this is a refreshingly cloudy drink. While I wasn?t taken too much by the aroma, the appearance, taste and palate befit this as a strong wheat beer. It is surprisingly refreshing and leaves a lovely wheat flavour in the mouth.

3750,"2012-05-27",4.1,"Appearance: Vitus pours a hazy, golden, light amber. Held to the light, oranges and yellow burst from the haze and almost make it glow. Superior. The head here is a finger and a half high mass of stark white, tiny bubbled foam. The thickness takes its time dissipating. It makes for an attractive and ""classic"" beer look. What should I expect from the oldest brewery in the world though? 

Smell: Cloves and bananas are the first things I detect. They dominate at first but theres a sweetness here followed by a wheat tang. Its neat, you can actually smell each layer come apart. Underneath everything is a peppery-ness to it all. Theres also a faint peach or apricot aroma...quite intoxicating. 

Mouthfeel: Very light. Vitus goes down incredibly smooth. Theres a weight here though, almost like a ""cereal"" texture inside it all. 

Taste: The first taste that hits has a creamy banana taste and quality. Its light but it lays on the tongue with confidence. As the creaminess fades and the beer moves to the middle of the tongue, theres a peppery-ness and the strong flavor of cloves. Each layer here is very simple and distinct. Its really something of beauty. As the beer finishes, everything smooths out and goes down as if it had never happened. Too drinkable. 

Overall: A reasonably price beer that looks, smells, feels and tastes amazing from the oldest brewery in the world. Could a beer lover ask for more? Id say no. Vitus is an all time favorite and a real showstopper for me. Pick this beer up. You will not be dissappointed.","Anna, Illinois, USA","mtlasley"

3750,"2012-04-16",4.4,"One of the worlds great beers and I meet up for the first time, we have somehow missed each other over the years. We come together in Cork, Ireland of all places during Nov 2010: I saw and bought this bottle in The Abbots Ale House, and reviewed it in my hotel lounge. Sadly the glass used was a half-pint tumbler, I would have loved the correct glass.

The beer poured a lovely lemony yellow, slightly cloudy, almost murky. A pure white head sat on top for both pours, the beer a darker lemon colour on the second pour.

The smells were a fantastic mix, yeast, vanilla, sweet banana and semi-sour cooking apples all rolled into one.

The taste held all the aroma ingrediants along with some grapefruit citrus hints added. Unusually for this style, a maltiness could also be found in the wonderful amalgamation of flavours.

I was at one with the world while drinking this beauty. The 7.7%ABV just sits within the flavours without being noticed, a truely amazing and one-off beer (as ColoradoBobs has been telling me for years).","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"
3750,"2012-04-15",3.7,"Yellow, quite cloudy body with an orange tint, supporting a large, creamy, white head that reduces to a fully lasting .5 cm layer rather quickly. Fair lacing. Did I mention that this was a gusher? Very strong sweet fruity and yeasty aroma with firm malty and hoppy notes. The banana is overwhelming, also spices, soap, perfume and hints of vanilla. The taste is initially very sweet indeed, followed by a light acidity and bitterness. Strong sweet flavours of sugary banana, citrus, spices, soap, perfume, also sweet honey and alcohol in the back. The body is surprisingly full (this is my first wizen bock, I was prepared for the usual light hefeweizen body), a smooth and syrupy texture with a very faint dryness in the aftertaste. An intense and highly enjoyable beer, barely on the right side of ""not too sweet"".

3750,"2012-02-28",3.7,"Pours a large, fluffy, off-white head, many centimeters in height and made up of medium-sized bubbles, creating a dense, sponge-like effect.  Head declines over several minutes to a persistent cap atop the beer.  Leaves small spots of lacing, nothing exciting.  Body is lighter than Aventinus, this a dark and hazy yellow-gold with orange and yellow highlights when held to the light. Hazy to the point of barely being able to see my hand through the glass, but can still make out some modest carbonation.

Aroma of wheat malt, old bananas, vanilla, and some bread. Not noticing phenolics or spices; wouldnt even be thinking about them if others hadnt mentioned detecting them. Seems simpler, less complex, than Aventinus.

Taste opens with sweetness and tanginess from wheat malt, dense banana bread, noticeable phenolics such as nutmeg and clove. Transitions midway to large amounts of pale wheat and barley malt sweetness with intense bananas, reduced phenolics, vanilla, and caramelized sugar.  Taste closes out with slight ethanol and some mild, but noticeable chocolate notes, which is a little unexpected, but interesting.

Body is medium to medium-heavy with modest carbonation, allowing for a smooth, creamy mouthfeel with just a bit of foaming up on the palate. Finish is dry, slightly sticky from sweetness.  Instead of being obviously smelt or tasted, alcohol burn is felt in the back of the mouth, throat, after each sip.","Wyoming, USA","tibicinoid"

3750,"2012-01-29",3.4,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2015 16.9 fl oz bottle, $4 from BellaVino. Half-hazy faded yellow color. A very nice one-finger amount of persisting foamy white head.

After sampling a few weizenbocks from lesser-known breweries and really enjoying them, Im disappointed by this offering from Weihenstephaner.

Medium to bigger body. Smooth, kind of crisp moderate carbonation. Sort of an abrupt texture. Mild dry finish. Nice big banana, mild spice, some nutty character.

The head was so long-lasting, I had to stop and wait several times in order to pour the entire bottle. This was my first Weizenbock. Ive been impressed with everything from Weihenstephaner, the worlds oldest brewery. Famous for their lager yeast, and their definitive German lager style beers, I just assumed this was one as well. It turns out, despite regular bocks being lagers, Weizenbock is an ale style. To me, Weihenstephaner ale yeast exhibits many of the same memorable characteristics as their lagers, just more of them: clouds of fruit, clove, pepper, even some banana. Very full-bodied malt-sweetness, balanced by noble bittering hops, virtually no aroma hops. Nice soft, round effect from the wheat. Sparkling carbonation, lasting pleasant aftertaste.

Appearance is hazy bright yellow. Tall foamy head. Big carbonation. Sunny.

The flavor is strong bubblegum and flowers. Touch of citrus and alcohol. Spicy clove. A sugary (but not too sweet) malt base grounds it -- a real backbone. The astringent alcohol (it IS 7.7%, after all), is the last flavor.

The palate is creamy, chewy, with a solvent-like finish. You can drink this chilled or warm. Its a well-grounded, not too sweet, not too banana-y, dark-flavored hef. You could call it Hef-Wei between.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

Bright, heady aroma awash with banana candy, green cardamom, lemon curd tart and botanical, Belgian-like suggestions. Thick, peppery, banana and reindeer beater-dominated flavour wafting with ground coriander and cardamom-like exoticism despite the reinheitsgewhatsit. A refresher, a summerbier, a beer you could sink by the mass on a balmy Bavarian evening. Or just an evening.

Interesting clove-like spice up front in the flavor gives way to a muted banana and wheaty/grainy profile.  Extremely effervescent, yet the carbonation is not prickly and really smooths out on the palate.  Finishes a little dry but is quite refreshing.  Alcohol is well-masked.

The aroma is a little muted, thanks to the head, but there are some typical weizen notes lurking in there, predominantly cloves and banana. Spicy hops up front introduce a smooth weizen body, with a fairly standard sweet finish. There is nothing at all wrong with this, but it is a bit too similar to many other weizens, and doesnt really stand out in the way that other weizen bocks, Erdinger Pikantus being a good example, do.

3750,"2011-01-25",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2011 500 ml, BB date reads 15.September 2011 therefore quite a fresh one, into tulip.
Hazy straw-yellow colored body topped by thick, rather low white head that slowly recedes and sticks to the walls. Weizenbock is essentially a Dunkelweizen brewed to the strength of a (Doppel)bock, however, the pale visual appearance of Vitus is reminiscent more of a Hefeweizen than Dunkleweizen. Aroma is Doppelbock-like sweetness with banana esters, clove phenolics and bready malt. A careful sniffing session reveals plum & raisin-like fruitiness that gets more prominent as the beer warms. Very faint alcohol shines through. Flavor is rich sweetness (suggesting the malt hasnt beet fermented thoroughly) with banana, clove and wheat. Hop flavor is virtually absent and the finish is somewhat balanced by light hoppy bitterness and very faint alcohol. The palate is sweet, body medium-full with very smooth creamy texture and moderate carbonation. As stated above, the appearance of Vitus resembles a good Hefeweizen although it is easily distinguished from the later by having a minor head and fuller body. There could be more melanoidin & dark fruit character but its a very decent beer nevertheless.","SLOVENIA","EvilBuddha"

Teh aroma is of dough, spices, banana, citrus- peach and apricot, pineapple. Teh appearance is nice dark gold yellow, with a tinge of amber in the light. The taste is complex. I sense, banana bread first, peaches, apricot, ginger, wheat and spices. Even a little pineapple after a swallow. The remnants left on the palate are a treat rather than a drag.

3750,"2011-01-19",4.2,"Not a weizenbock so much as an imperial hefeweizen; a variation of the classic Weihenstephan hefe turned up to 11. Both beers share much in their cloudy straw appearance and the familiar banana and clove nose. The biggest eyebrow-raiser with the Vitus is the assertive spiciness (which work beautifully with the other hefe yeast aromas) and the well-hidden-but-warming alcohol. Seems to transport better than the regular hefe as well, which for us in Australia makes a difference in terms of consistency; I can only hope it stays readily available.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","beardfear"
3750,"2011-01-18",3.9,"500 ml Btl.  Poured into a weizen glass, pours slightly hazy, almost completely opaque golden orange.  When the last 1/3 of the bottle was swirled and poured straight on top this beer becomes a masterpiece.  Swirling, cloudy, dense orange with a few stray particles floating under a massive frothy dome of puffy white head with droplets of brown yeast residue here and there.  Absolutely 5/5 on appearance!  Unfortunately, the head dies fast, leaving little lacing, but small alcohol ""legs"" on the glass as it recedes.  Aroma is wonderful and very complex: big spices, clove, wheat, grass, banana, yeast, bread, dough, funk, malt, slight acidity and mild alcohol.  Taste is very much the same, smooth and almost creamy upfront with a strong wheatiness throughout - then followed by the banana/clove flavor and at last rounded out by a rather sizable spicy bite on the tail end and into the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is light to medium; creamy, smooth, and then a little more abrasive and hot (I think mostly via the carbonation or a combination of carbonation, spices and alcohol) at the end.  After it warms a little it gets more mellow - although the abrasiveness and heat in the end are reasonable (at 7.7%) and a bit unique - they keep it from getting a higher score from me.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","WolfsBlood84"

A- Body is a uniformly cloudy pale yellow hue. Pours with a massice 3 figner+ foamy white head-which eventually fades to a retains nicely at one finger. Some lacing is left behind in the glass. A constant stream of bubbles can be seen steadily rising to the top.

S- This brew pretty much has the nose of a classic German Hefe. Bready yeast is the main character-but a mild amount of clove and banana come through as well-the overall impression of the nose is soft.

T- Clove is the main character upfront with a mild banana and bready yeast backbone. The finish is dry and slightly peppery with a hint of floral hops and a nice smooth bready yeast backbone-and a touch of dry alcohol heat.

M- High tingly carbonation and a lightweight smooth and slightly bready body.

D- This beer is a winner- I cant believe I didnt try it until now- The overall profile is very similar to this brewerys hefe weizen-only its the imperial version- the broadness of the weizenbock style never ceases to amaze me-but if there were a classic example-this would be it!

I wasnt sure how this would work out but at $2.99 I was willing to roll the dice. If it had turned out to be subpar theres no shame in pouring the rest down the drain. As it turns out I finished all but the very bottom of the bottle. I should get around to trying more of these affordable German beers to stretch the budget. They might not be the greatest beers but the combination of price and quality is hard to beat.

Aroma / Appearance - Exceptionally foamy the pour took a long time to settle down. When it did I was left with a rosy golden body that was the color of the midday sun. Lemon icing, white bread, and basic hops are pretty plain but not awful. It did however exceed my expectations.

Flavor / Palate - Honey, graham crackers, and a trace of dried ham were not exactly the combination I was prepared for. Somehow though it all came together into something that was more than the sum of its parts. While I wasnt exactly rushing to refill my glass I drank more than I thought I would. Given the price point and other factors it gets high all around marks. Eventually I may get around to trying more but I doubt it will be soon.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3750,"2010-06-12",4.5,"Aroma: Bananas and cloves are the main scents with a very big emphasis on the fruit. There is a slight yeast scent blended in there and maybe even a bit nutmeg to add to the complexity.
Appearance: I gave the beer a vigorous pour and there was initially a large, rocky and abundant head but that faded quickly and my glass is left with a solid layer of frothy foam. The color is hazy straw/ golden. The beer is not so hazy that I cant watch some bubbles stream to the top and replenish the head though. The head is a bit of a disappointment since I do expect a bit more from a German Weizen, but the fact that it is a bock may have something to do with it. I love the lightness in color though. Im drinking the beer from my Aventinus glass and the difference in color could not be more striking between the two beers of similar style.
Taste/Palate: Very full of esters with big up front yeast and fruit. This bock is rich, hearty and sweet feeling with residual sugar throughout. The beer is not cloying though due to the amazing carbonation and acidity with really washes my mouth clean of any sugar feeling, leaves me refreshed and my saliva glads anticipating the next sip. The label says we have a 7.7% beer here and Im hear to say that none of that big alcohol shines through. If I didnt know better I would have thought this beer to be a very full and rich hefeweizen with robust character. After a while the banana fades into a fruit smoothie with oranges and spice.
Overall: I kept thinking about brunch tomorrow and how this would be a great substitute for the omnipresent mimosa. The bock is lively and rich which would be an outstanding pair to breakfast foods and theres just enough alcohol to get your Sunday morning juices flowing.","USA","Bludwig"

very nice wheaty slighlty tart, flowery and peach+banana fruity aroma. even though fruity also appears quenching , dry and slightly citrussy. a little more sweet malty alc. aroma than what is in an ordinary wheat beer.
flavor is wheaty, sweet malty, alcohol, banana in the background, citrussy note from the aroma not there anymore. The stronger alc and malt flavor doesnt really do any good to the delicate wheat flavor. Perhaps it would be better if You had it very cold. You dont really notice the 7.7% abv that much.

Wasnt dark enough or malty enough to be a true Weizen Bock, made it a little muddled for me. This wasnt terrible, Id call it solid & drinkable, but not really true to style.

3750,"2008-08-02",3.8,"Pours dirty gold straw with a fluffy white head, eventually dissipating to a small layer of foam.  Aroma is very much like their wonderful hefe, with an emphasis on pungent grass, hay, clove, smoke, cheese, mushrooms, with a toasty and slight caramel quality.  Flavor has pretty sweet caramel, light toast, bread and white chocolate malt that mixes well with the pungent grass, cloves, hay and mushroom.  Good combo of malt and yeast.  High carbonation medium bodied, the beer feels good, but not heavy.  Only vaguely warming on the throat.  As enjoyable as this is, it’s just too similar to their regular wheat beer for me.  I’d prefer a weizenbock to be a bit MORE different, but nonetheless this is very good and emphasizes the things I like in a wheat beer.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

3750,"2008-05-09",3.8,"Golden yellow. Creamy, rocky stark-white head with superb density. Glowing clove-dusted lemon, melon, pineapple, green banana and floral hop aromas. Suggestion of bubblegum and vanilla. Expansive carbonation deposits a slightly fuzzy residue as it settles on the tongue. Vibrant and spicy with clove and an explosive medley of fruity esters ranging from pineapple, honeydew melon and dessert apples. Fluffy notes of bubblegum are beautifully composed and understated, and serve to soften the body while absorbing some of the slippery fruitiness. Wavering yet poignant clove flavors tickle the palate while augmenting the dryness. Tangy wheat lurks in the background, bolstering the body and gently caressing the yeast-driven fruitiness. Floral hops match the juiciness of the esters as an uplifting flash of acidity emerges. Quite uplifting despite its strength. Yeast pour  imparts a nutty quality which enhances the body and impressively brightens the nuances. Alcohol gently scratches the throat at the swallow while lightly warming the gullet. Finishes with a banana-pudding effect as the lengthy wheat tailing, which takes on a breadier, straw-like quality, fuses with the creamy banana esters. Bubblegum, pineapple, and clove linger on the palate for quite some time.

Rather pleasant.","Oregon, USA","Beerly There"

3750,"2008-03-04",3.7,"This is pretty well carbonated as a soft pour still yields a full three-finger thick, frothy, pale tan colored head.  The beer is a light gold color and shows a very lightly hazed, straw gold color when held up to the light.  The aroma is distinctly full of clove phenolics, even seeming a bit fruity in its clove character.  Wheat like grain notes provide a touch of bread aromatics, some light tartness and some cracker-malt notes.  Banana esters mix in with the clove notes, but are definitely noticed as well.  There are also some plum like notes as well as a touch of apple aromatics.

Well carbonated, yet still creamy like many a good Hefeweizen; this does have a touch more body than your standard Hefe, but so far if I was presented this blind I would be hard pressed to guess that this is something other than a normal Hefeweizen.  The strength of this brew shows up in the esters that are noticeable; this is a bit more fruity than your typical strength Hefe with flavors of plum, Macintosh apples and green raisins.  This fruitiness is backed by a spicy, phenolic finish reminiscent of the turpenes particular to cloves.  As the beer loses some of its zippy carbonation and warms up just a touch it begins to pick up a lightly concentrated banana note in the middle.  This has a light tartness to it than helps to accentuate the various fruit components a bit.

The last pour that has some yeast sediment to it, adds a bit more yeasted tartness to this brew, which is a nice added dimension.  I really like this take on the Weizenbock; it really is just a slightly amped up version of a well made Hefeweizen with the increased gravity producing more interesting esters and phenolics.

3750,"2007-12-30",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 13, 2013 My Bottom Line:
This pale Weizenbock harbors a most complex fusion of sweet pears, bananas, spicy phenols and citrusy wheat in a nourishing and drinkable body. This brewery is as solid as they get.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the cloudy straw yellow.
-Effervescence is smooth and lively, increasing drinkability.
-The flavor profile is diverse yet balanced.
-The full mouthfeel is marvelous because it remains quaffable and its residual sugars are beautifully lifted by cuddly carbonation.
-Complex and elegant, this Weizenbock showcases this prolific yeasts (and brewers) many talents.

3750,"2007-12-28",3.6,"500 mL bottle.  Poured into a 500 mL Franziskaner wheat beer glass.  Hazy yellow pour with a tinge of orange as well.  Even with a slow pour, I had to pour half, then let it sit to allow the head to dissipate before I finished pouring.  Aroma matched that of most standard hefe-weizens: estery banana, spicy clove, maybe some coriander.  Flavor was similar, but with considerably more maltiness than a hefe and a thicker mouthfeel to it.  This almost seemed chewy to me and took away from the beer.  Probably due to the higher abv.  Im a huge fan of wheat beers, and even though this was good, its not one Ill seek out again.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","Illini08"
3750,"2007-12-26",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 27, 2009 Ive had two of these within the last few weeks. The first one I had at the in laws house and poured in a semi-appropriate glass (a pilsner), The second was at the Lava Lounge in Waterloo, IA a few days ago and was served to me with a Trappist chalice?!?!?!?!? I will say this much, that this beer ought to be served in appropriate glassware, as it does affect the taste. 
This is (regardless of glassware) a very delicious beer. Pours a hazy golden color with a nice soft billowy head. The aroma is that old familiar weizen banana/clove scent. The taste of course compliments and to some degree matches this, however not as much so as in a hefe. The beer has a very good sweet/dry balance, and has a defined alcohol flavor that compliments the beer quite well. There is a faint hop presence.

3750,"2007-12-21",4.2,"500 ml. euro bottle, freshness date in the bottom center of the back label, sampled in a weizen glass.

Cloudy appearance and bright yellowish orange in color, robust white head of frothy, creamy foam that has good retentive powers with a fair amount of curtain-like sticky lace. You could say that this looks like a premium hefeweizen.

A delectable nose of banana, clove and lemons, hints of peppery spice and a backing of white wheat flour malts. The alcohol is quite estery smelling.

Creamy, lush medium feeling body buoyed by the active carbonation, this is very lively in the palate. Barley grains and malted wheat, bananas and lemons, earthy spices and clove, you get hit with a lot of flavors at once. The yeast becomes more nutty towards the end. Mellow hop spiciness that adds to the yeasty and cracker-like finish, a dry and clean finish that leaves you wanting more. The alcohol is noticeable through out the taste, low fruity warmth before turning spicy in the finale.

3750,"2007-12-01",4.0,"I guess for some reason I was so biased, I really expected this to be a dark beer, I am just so trained to think a Weizen Bock to be like Aventinus, dark.  I was highly surprised to see this pour a thick golden color with a thick head.  No clarity in the beer at all, just too thick.  The head fades rather quickly but leaves a surface covering lacing that is pretty sticky. Aroma first hits you with a sweet bubblegum and light banana and followed by other tropical fruits in light syrup.  Aroma is syrupy, sweet, strong, but yet it is very German.  Taste is not as sweet as the aroma suggested.  It turns into a sunshine-floral yeastiness with light sugar candy edges. The beer is well carbonated and a very spiky mouthfeel, which sets off the rather heavy body and the strong esters in the beer. The beer finishes fizzy with light lemon zinginess all over.  Basically, an American brewer would call this an Imperial Hefe but I see this as Weihenstephaners answer to the Schneider-Brooklyner collaboration without the American hoppiness. I love it when the Germans let there yeast to take over and work its magic, subdued can become so boring.

Strong peachy-apricot sweetness, with even some succulent mango notes.  A very uniform, smooth malt sweetness takes on an aroma of vanilla-cream.  Quite sweet, as others mention, but its a German strong ale, would you expect it to not be richly malted?  Trailing nicely on the end is a dry, highly aromatic, rustic even, hay-like wheat character that takes some of the focus off the sweetness.  Alcohol was well enough concealed and no flaws noted.  Medium-high strength of aroma.Half way between chewy and sticky, is the malt body on this, with round, succulent ripe nectarine and apricot fruitiness and a rich honey-tinted vanilla cream sweetness from the wonderfully extracted (but perhaps somewhat underattenuated malts).  Im not going to say too much more about the sweetness, despite my preference for dry beers.  Sometimes the beer is just meant to be a sweet dessert sipper, as in this case.  Its not like Weihenstephaner yeast dosent ferment the beer well, if it needs to, and certainly the brewers know enough how to.  Obviously intentional is the sweetness, then, and soft and supportive it feels on the palate.  Even a little bit of wheat or yeast-like tartness on the finish....

3750,"2007-10-17",4.0,"500 mL bottle purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston.  Pours a perfect cloudy straw.  I probably would have given a perfect score for appearance if this was a hefeweizen and not a weizenbock, as this is the lightest weizenbock I have ever seen.  Definitely not to style.  Nice wheaty and yeasty aroma.  It certainly does fit the weizenbock profile in its flavour though.  Strong flavours - wheat, yeast, banana.  The alcohol feels evident - or that could just be the aftereffects of the Indian dinner.  I am liking this significantly better than Weihenstephaners dunkelweizen, but then again, Im a big fan of this style.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","sstackho"

Lightly alcoholic, but the spritzy mouthfeel keeps it from being too apparent.

Great mouthfeel/palate. Very soft and smooth. Not what I expected in a weizenbock but tasty brew nonetheless.

3750,"2007-06-02",3.8,"A new drop from the lads at Weihenstephan Universitat/brauerei is always welcome, this one hit the spot nicely, I must say.The picture of good health on the pour. Inches and inches of solidly expansive, snow-white head adorned a hazy, dull, yellowy-gold body filled with rampant effervescence. The retention is phenomenal, the lacing a medley of fine white lines. Big banana smoothie nose with underpinning lemon and lime notes, a little strawberry in there too as some rough cloves and fresh cracked pepper. The palate compliments the nose, it is hefeweissbier-hell in perfect form only pressingly stronger. Big whack of cloves, some alcohol spice, in amongst so much ripe banana and sourish malts. A little vanilla and pine peaks in. It is clean, the body misleadingly light and fuelled by plenty of rushing carbonation. A little warmth on the swallow - the alcohol is held back well, very controlled - the finish has juicy, tangy, sourish fruit, cloves and strong woody, wheat-malt notes. I can say I also got notes of mocha on the nose and on the palate though this seems a little leftfield of a beer so pale. It is balanced very nicely and for a beer of such strength it is indeed a refreshing quaffer. It does however lack the complexity of most Dunkel Weizenbocks but you could say that is a plus - this bad-boy creeps up on you. A nice drop; not extraordinary but deserving of apt appreciation.
