2287,"2017-06-13",4.7,"Bottle 0,75L at Gas Station, Ljubljana. Shared with Kita. Dark brown color with some reddish hue with small, frothy, light brown head. Aroma of wood, cognac, dried fruits, caramel and a touch of Belgian yeasts. Semi sweet taste with dried fruits, burnt sugar and light bitter finish with woody notes. Excellent brew! Thanks to Kita for sharing.","Ilirska Bistrica, SLOVENIA","CanCrusher"
2287,"2017-06-07",5.0,"Bottle, 0.75l, shared with CanCrusher. Pours hazy dark brown color with thick creamy light brown head and sparkling appearance. Aroma of wood, cognac, vanilla, yeast and dried fruit. Taste starts with sweet and rich toasted malt, dried fruit and burnt sugar, follows by rich woody and vanilla notes, mouthfeel is warming alcoholic, while finish is mild bitter. Full body, creamy texture and average carbonation in palate. I know it¬ís not so perfect as my rating is, but I just liked it so much...","Koper, SLOVENIA","Kita"
2287,"2017-05-10",3.6,"Bottle shared with Koelschtrinker, Beerhunter111 & Zlotta. Fresh malty beginning. The wood is low, the beer is nice as usual. Dried dark fruit, quite dry, very fresh and smooth. The body is mild, smooth malty, alcoholic-woody in the aftertaste. Nice but not as round as expected.","Wuppertal, GERMANY","Erzengel"

2287,"2017-04-29",3.7,"Sampled from 0.75 l bottle from ¬íSpeciaalbierpakket.nl¬í, bottled in August 2016. Clear, dark reddish brown with a medium large, frothy, slowly diminishing, off-white head. Sweetish, malty, slightly fruity and a bit yeasty-spicy aroma of prunes, raisins, caramel, vanilla, oak and some Cognac. Moderately sweet, malty, slightly fruity and a bit yeasty-spicy taste of caramel, prunes, raisins, vanilla, oak, marzipan and Cognac, followed by a medium long, moderately bitter, slightly yeasty-spicy, a bit woody-dry and minimally warming-alcoholic finish. Medium body, slightly creamy and moderately effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Very nice, decent sipper, although again not as great as hoped, lacks intensity and complexity, comes across as a bit simple for what it promises to be.","Hagen / Bonn, GERMANY","Zlotta"

2287,"2017-04-02",4.3,"Bottle from a Dutch ¬íslijterij¬í shared with Craftmember and Hinke, tasted alongside the October 2016 (""2016/2"") version in the same series, from which it apparently differs in the more modest cognac barrel part and an added chestnut barrel part. Like the 2016/2, the bottle opens under a lot of pressure, more so even than the 2016/2, with a very loud bang and smoke escaping from it, but no gushing whatsoever. Thick, very moussy, bit irregular but very stable head, a tad darker beige than the 2016/2 and thicker; colour is similar too (burgundy hazy bronze) but with much more visibly fierce sparkling. Lovely perfumey bouquet, clearly different from the 2016/2, with impressions of ¬ícherry pralines¬í, caramel sauce, tawny port, honey-glazed spareribs, banana, wet oak wood, chestnuts, toffee, brandy, marzipan, in all sweeter and less tannic than the 2016/2 but with a distinctive ¬ímeaty¬í note to it. Fruity onset, lots of candied fruit and residual brown sugar in a very noble way, slightly more outspoken berry-like sourishness and a meaty umami aspect which was not present in the 2016/2; more fizzy carbonation as well. Rich caramelly malt middle with lots of residual candi sweetness, a tad more sticky and less tannic-dry than the 2016/2, with subtle and beautiful candied orange and (even more subtle) cognac flavors added in the end; the red berry-like sourishness lingers along with herbal hop bitterness, wood aspects and warming, port-like alcohol. The difference with the 2016/2 next to it is a lot more obvious than expected, both clearly have their own personality, with this one being perhaps a tad closer to a regular Grande R√©serve, carrying less tannins but adding an unexpected, but very pleasant meat-like (protein) accent. Difficult to determine which one is best, technically they are clearly at equal height, but purely out of personal preference, I tend to put the 2016/2 slightly above this one. Both beers impressed more than expected, for sure, and made all tasters curious for the new 2017 version. A series to watch closely, that much is certain.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

2287,"2017-03-24",4.5,"Deep brown with amber edges and a soft pillowy off-white head. Sweet caramelized sugar aroma. Soft texture. Sweet, burnt sugar with Belgian yeast dried fruit character; woody, oaky, tannin notes with light cognac booze edges. Really cool to taste one of the best most revered beers with a modern edge. 

Notes: bottle carried back from Brussels in September '16, opened in March '17.

2287,"2017-03-20",3.5,"Shared 750 ml bottle with my brothers. Pours clear dark brown with a small weak tan head. Woody aroma with dark malts, caramel, dark fruits. Taste is much of the same, dominated by wooden malts, moderate sweet, dark sugars, noticeable alcohol at the weak dry finish. Nice one, but nothing out of this world.","Sandnes, NORWAY","gunnar"

Nice fizzy-creamy mediumlasting head, dark amber color. Aroma is slightly sweet mineraly, candi sugar, minerals, grass, raisins, oak, almonds, toast, fruit stones, toffee. Taste is slightly sour-ish mineraly, oak, weeds, minerals, raisins, fruit stones, candi sugar, almonds, butterscotch, grass, toast, toffee.
