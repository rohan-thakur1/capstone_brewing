4193,"2017-04-02",3.3,"Bottle. Pours a clear brown body with a one finger fizzy beige head. The nose is sweet with caramel and light coffee with some husky grain. The flavor is on the sweeter side with a little toasty and husky maltiness. Some light-roast coffee, a little chocolate, finishes with burnt caramel. Medium bodied with light soft carbonation and a little cling to the finish. Decent, but I gotta think theres lots of good Dunkler Bocks across the pond better than what we get here in bottles.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
4193,"2017-01-14",3.6,"Germany. Clear mahogany pour with a beige head and good retention. Color turns cloudy brown. Decent lacing. Good dark malt dominant flavor interrupted by a boozy finish. 8.4 ABV is somewhat hidden.","The Beach, Florida, USA","Kleg"
4193,"2016-12-08",3.6,"Pours a brown with a medium beige head. The aroma seems sweet and consists of toffee, raisin, cherry, nuts, and spice. The taste remains sweet. Here I find brown sugar, toasted malts, bread, cherry, and caramel. The brown sugar is a constant flavor is most pronounced. The aftertaste is mild and is caramel and cherry. This one is medium in body, thin in texture, and has some fizzy carbonation. This doesnt have the feeling that its as strong as it actually is. Solid.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"
4193,"2016-12-04",3.9,"Pours a clear garnet/amber with a full rocky light tan head that laces. Aroma is malt and a spicy earthiness. Taste is sweet caramel malt, buttered biscuits, toffee, a bit of sweet chewing tobacco and mild hoppiness. This is wonderful and the ABV goes unnoticed.","OFallon, Illinois, USA","wxman"
4193,"2016-11-28",3.9,"330 ml green bottle. Pours brown with tall, long lasting, fluffy, off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of noble hops, dark fruit
and toasted malt. Body is medium and smooth. Grassy hops, spices, toasted malt and dry fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long and spicy. Tasty brew.",", New Jersey, USA","mike67"
4193,"2016-11-25",3.7,"12oz-ish bottle pours hazy amber with a large khaki head that lasts. Aroma is toffee, date, prune, and toast. Medium sweet flavor, malty, caramel and toffee, mild roast. Medium-full bodied, average carbonation, clean feel. Really solid dunkler bock.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
4193,"2016-10-18",3.6,"Bottle from Gourmet Haus Staudt in Redwood City, CA. Aroma is malts, bread, some raisins. Taste is malty and a bit sweet, bready, earthy / herbal finish. Had back-to-back with the Hofbräu Maibock which was a bigger, more complex and tastier version of this beer.","Redwood City, California, USA","tightslice"
4193,"2016-09-11",2.8,"From Hipercor. In Teku glass. After dinner. A bit alcoholic, with nothing more than the alcoholic feeling. Not unpleasant but boring, without much taste","SPAIN","josanguapo"

4193,"2016-04-19",3.4,"Pour is a murky brown with a large tan head. Aroma is a decent roasted nut with some molasses sweetness. Flavor is a nice helping of dark fruit and more of the thick molasses type malt. Leaves a nice raison juice on the tongue as this goes down. Pretty flavorful German winter warmer.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
4193,"2016-03-22",3.5,"11.2 oz bottle pours amber with an off white head. Aroma of toffee, caramel and grains. Taste is nutty and caramel.","nashville, Tennessee, USA","edgallow"
4193,"2016-03-12",3.6,"11.2oz bottle - nose is nutty and toasty. When I saw this bottle on the shelf being described as the Delicator, I was hoping it was a Doppelbock, but nope. This is a nice consolation beer. Complex maltiness.","Taylor Mill, Kentucky, USA","Chudwick"
4193,"2016-03-08",3.7,"Deep dark nutty Amber with a fading ivory head. Earthy and boozy Germanic dark nose, and a touch of clove. Smooth and semisweet dark malty flavor. Nice subtle alcohol that lingers. Basically a strong winter brown ale, with a kiss of semisweet earthy cocoa.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
4193,"2016-02-25",3.6,"Bottle:
Cloudy, dark brown, with a short, off-white head.
Earthy, caramel, nutty aroma.
Taste is rich, slightly bitter caramel malt, dried nuts.
An herbal/earthy bittering.
Tasty.
Nice to drink a Winter Festbier thats not totally consumed with spices for a change.","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"
4193,"2016-02-19",3.9,"Bottle. Nutty toffee malt and astringent alcohol aroma. Dark amber with small head. Sweet nutty toffee malt and mildly bitter/astringent herbal hay and alcohol flavor. Nice body. Very good.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
4193,"2016-02-10",3.4,"bottle @ Party Town / Florence KY --- Aroma of dark malt. Clear amber brown color, smooth 1"" beige head, strips and streaks of lace. Taste is full-bodied dark malt that adds mild carbonation on the swallow before moving to a lightly hopped finish. If this is 8.4%, it hides it incredibly well. A robust malt-centered brew, but light in the stomach and easy to quaff. I like it.","Lakeside Park, Kentucky, USA","rondphoto"
4193,"2016-02-08",3.1,"Green glass. Nose of heavy cola, caramel, dark malt, hint of smoke and a lot of grain. Pours dark mahogany and supports a soapy tan head. Taste lightly sweet, malty but murky, smoke and roast are there, no coffee, much more thick and gooey caramel with cola, some red berry in the background. Full body a little lifeless, sluggish, with clean medium bitterness offering just a wisp of balance. Alcohol pretty well controlled, but theres a sense of stripped industrialism. I like the inherent malt soul but the caramel just muddles everything to the point of non-recognition. [2016.02.08: 3.1]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

4193,"2016-01-17",3.5,"This is a big, sweet doppelbock-ish lager. Its clear and deep amber w/ a short lived head and little spots of lacing on the side of the glass. The malt character here is really nice, deep and raisiny w/ some nutty, toasty highlights. It is a bit on the sweet side but not to the point of being cloying due to the firm hand of bitterness in the finish. I actually wasnt expecting much from this green bottle German brew but its a pretty damn good beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
4193,"2016-01-12",3.5,"Sampled from a 12 oz green bottle this beer poured a dark nut brown with a bit of an orange hue and a large fluffy beige head that left a bit of lacing. The aroma was sweet and malty with toffee and mild fruitiness. The flavor was sweet and toasty malts, tobacco, cola, toffee, dark fruits and a bit of bread. Nicely complex yet subdued. Medium length finish. Medium body and smooth. Pleasant.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"
4193,"2016-01-10",3.4,"12 oz. bottle from Liquor Barn (Jefferson Commons); shared with my Boo. Aroma: Moderate tootsie roll chocolate; moderate spiced bread; lighter nutty impressions. Appearance: Darker chestnut brown pour with a foamy bone head that settles into a ring. Flavor: Rich, spiced bread up front with more chocolate/nutty notes thereafter, leading to a lingering herbal hop finish; some raisiny character develops as this warms. Palate: Medium body, sticky texture, soft carbonation, long finish. Overall: This is a pretty nice winter seasonal, and is definitely one that lovers of bock biers should try.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"
