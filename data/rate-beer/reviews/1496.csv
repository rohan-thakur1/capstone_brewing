1496,"2016-11-30",3.8,"Bottle, sampled in a glass, 
this ale had a black-brown pour, I could see through this beer at the edge of the glass, and the pour made a one half to one finger head of tan colored bubbles, the head receded quickly to a quarter size island and ring, head was made up of tiny bubbles with some larger bubbles, swirling the glass made a thicker cover, the beer was dark and looked an Imperial Stout, swirling the glass left a dark film of beer on the side of the glass, this beer left some spots and small fingers of lacing on the sides of the glass, there was a wide ring (about 3/4) of sediment on the bottom of the bottle, 

the nose had lots of toasted and dry roasted malt with some roasted grain, chocolate and dry dark chocolate, some toasted grain, 
some dark fruit in the background (dark tart cherry?), 

the flavors were roasted malt and grain, dark tart cherry, faint chocolate, hint of licorice, some roasted malt and caramel like sweetness, 
molasses flavor with much less sweetness than molasses, 
the finish was dark cherry and some malt bitterness trailing, maybe some malt astringency in this drink, the malt astringency was not enough to take away from the enjoyment of this drink, 
there was no alcohol flavor but I cold tell this beer had 9% alc., the alcohol was hidden well.

mouth feel was more than medium, some creaminess on the palate, 

the aroma and flavor had lots of big roasted malt and grain, a nice drink.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

1496,"2015-05-14",3.8,"Bottle: Pours inky black & semi-thick, slightly translucent brown edges. Deep, leathery tan head slowly forms on top after pouring. Aroma is very heavy & robust. Mildly sweet & half-charred roasted malt, licorice, anise, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, a hint of dark fruits, prunes, dates, with even a very small hint of vinousness in the periphery. Small touch of warming alcohol. Taste is much heavier on the booze; very warming with a modest fusel essence. Dark chocolate, fudge cake, roasted malts, burnt coffee beans. Starts off each sip with creamy-sweet & quickly transitions into more roasty-bitter. Hops add a tiny bit of herbal ashiness to the back-end. Finishes with burnt malt sugars, roast, mild char, coffee, & dense chocolate. Thick, silky body with low carbonation. A damn fine porter from Shorts.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

1496,"2014-09-07",4.1,"Yet another Shorts Imperial bottle from Deuanes basement shared with StormKing47 and myself.


A - Pours opaque black with a nice one and a half finger tall mocha colored head leaving light lace down the glass.


S - Smells of dark roasted chocolate malt, dry oak, molasses, licorice, and some light berry twang at the very end of each sniff. Quite complex really.


T - Starts off with a big dose of sweet chocolate malt quickly giving way to a mix of even sweeter molasses, dark fruits, watered down espresso, licorice, and dry oak tannins. The finish is a mix of light sweetness and a slight berry twang, lingering on the pallet for a short period of time. This one is complex yet quite balanced. Very nice English porter.


M - Medium-Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Smooth, creamy, feel with a small twang at the very end. Very nice feel.


O - Every time I drink a Shorts beer in a small bottle they leave me a bit let down but then we drink one of these imperial bottles and they quickly win me back. I hope to try some of the other imperials some day...","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

1496,"2014-03-25",4.4,"Bottling dates disappeared. $2 single poured into a Perfect Pint.

Appearance: Pitch black. Looks more like a stout than a porter. Brown head leaving very good lacing. Nice pour.

Smell: Very dark. It just smells bitter. Black coffee/roast, dark chocolate, a char sort of aroma as well. Good stuff.

Taste/feel: 9.15% is something that really surprises me about this beer. It drinks like itd be 6.5-7%. A robust flavor thats not typically seen in a porter. Heavy dark chocolate and roast like the aroma would suggest, with a sort of char-like finish with a lingering bitterness. Theres a bit of sweetness in the sip, almost one that seems to be offered up by a dark fruit kind of flavor. The aftertaste is roasty and a bit smokey even. Lingers a good while. The body is great. Medium mouthfeel with a medium/high carbonation, so it really is more like a porter than a stout in my mind.

I had to bump up the taste and overall rating of this brew a tick for the simple fact that it (somehow) only costs $2 for a single. This is a big, big, delicious porter thats dangerously drinkable. Its big on flavor, but never too rich, and an absolute delight to drink. 

I honestly feel like this is Shorts best beer, and I doubt they could top this one. Brilliant brew.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

1496,"2013-04-25",3.4,"In short: A sweet biscuity-chocolaty porter without much personality and lacking in the mouthfeel department.  Just a decent beer overall.
How: Bottle 12oz.  Consumed when around 6 months of age.  Bottle from sarro, thanks a lot Kyle.
The look: Black body topped by a persistent small tan head.
In long: Nose is medium roasty and some chocolaty pastry.  Malt bill brings forward a strong grainy cookies sensation, chocolate cookies, caramel cookies.  Also noted some char, a bit of coffee, some wet tobacco.  A thick juicy mouthfeel sensation but without almost any fruity flavors.  Low-medium carbonation level, could have used more bubbles.  For a near 9% brew I thought this stale juicy mouthfeel was unsatisfying.  A mild bittersweet black chocolate bitterness.  Feels rather sweet.  Alcohol is mostly well hidden.  Nothing bad in this beer but also nothing remarkable.  Well brewed but unexciting, a straightforward big black beer that I found inoffensively drinkable, somethings missing.  In nowadays beer scene this beer seems trailing behind a bit, old-fashioned and behind its time this beer should be called Republican Porter.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

I didnt even realize this was an imperial porter until I looked at the specs here. Now that Im looking for it, I get a little alc. warmth in the finish, but this isnt my first beer of the night, so I didnt really notice it (I was trying to slow down!). Its making a great pairing with my lamb-meat meatball sub right now, though. Bigger, chewier body. Light, smooth, and even crisp carbonation. Alcohol taste might be noticeable when I think about it, but like I mentioned, for the first couple sips I had no idea that this was even an imperial. Just a bigger bodied ale, which works for great for the porter style. Light alcohol warmth, big bitter taste, light sweet - more what youd call bittersweet. In the way that bittersweet chocolate is. Theres a nice dark chocolate aroma here. Good darker roast coffee aromas. Minimal dark fruit. I get the little herbal hops. Great imperial porter. Huge, big delicious taste.

A good representation of the style I guess but Im not a big fan.  Re-rate 2/13/13.  I think my tastes have changed in a year.  I dont really get smoke out of this beer anymore.

1496,"2012-03-13",4.0,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/3/2011.  Served on tap in a tulip at Redcoat Tavern.

My glass arrives with an ebony, nearly black viscous beer with a wispy off-white film on top. Totally dark with no light getting through anywhere. The light head might be more due to the pour than the beer itself. We may never know.

The aroma is full of robust roasted malts. Dark, bitter chocolate really stands out, with some espresso, tobacco, and light vanilla sweetness.

The flavor starts with a full, slightly sweet and fairly bitter roast malt flavor, and the complexity gradually unfolds. Dark bitter chocolate is the most dominant flavor, with coffee and deep, fully roasted grainy malt coming in next. A bit of earthy bitterness at the end, but it is very subdued. The result is a balanced beer at the end.

For a porter, this is very full bodied. The carbonation is light, like it is reduced and smoothed out by the full body. Rich and creamy best describes the feel overall.

Every time I come to Michigan is another chance to try a new Shorts beer, if I can find them on tap. I really enjoyed this full flavorful porter and would definitely drink it again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Its a little hot, and theres some sugary aspects to it that present in bright tropical and summery fruits, like watermelon especially.  Underneath all this its just very, very chocolate-heavy.

It tastes now like a calm, english imperial stout, maybe it was like that to start with, but again it just feels so settled down to me.  The malts are just smooth as velvet , rich with blackberry and deeply bitter anise flavors, swimming in chocolate and dark roasted coffee and christmas puddings.  Its really a pure anise taste.  But, because the beer has such a fulsome, healthy malt flavor the bitter-spicy anise taste comes across only as a an accent touch, if a heavy one.  It works fantastically.  The underlying doughiness and soft spice of the yeast is what makes a well-made english imperial stout a thing to behold, and its what makes the flavor of this one so outstanding, accepting that its listed as it is.


The palate is delicate and rich, and it has an uncommon smoothness that velvety really doesnt describe; it almost shimmers.  Its spectacularly clean for a beer of this kind; theres not a trace of hollowed out malt bitterness; rather, this feels like every edge has been rubbed smooth. 

If theres one shortcoming, its that it tends to feel a little hollow right after swallowing; at this point its smoothness seems to taper briefly into thinness, if only slightly.  Then, a peppery, red wine-like jamminess sits heavily in the back of my mouth, and some mineral-like tannic bitterness also settles in.  Finally, as there has been throughout, theres just a huge cavendish flavor; smoky, raisiny, and hot in a good, visceral way.

This would be an ideal autumn-and-pipe beer if I could get it easily.  Thanks so much for the opportunity, to Derek, easily one of the very finest.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Pours completely black in the glass with a big creamy tan head that clings to the side of the glass and leaves great lacing. The head hangs on as a cap for the duration. Beautiful looking beer for the style.

The taste doesnt quite live up to the aroma (tough ask for me). Its got the dark chocolate malts forming a backbone underneath the caramel, vanilla and coffee. Definitely some licorice in there as well.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation and dry cocoa-like finish.

1496,"2009-03-22",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 17, 2012 750mL Bottle. Thanks Andy! Aroma casts a fresh, bristling dark roast. Classic and deep. Rich, nuanced and detailed aroma, backed with chocolate, a slight twinge of age and some house yeast character that works for this beer. Pours black, with a well-lacking creamy tan rim. Piquant and darkly tangy roast edge to this. A really intense rich roast in the porter tradition, backed with some lightly piney hops. Prickly and coppery. Vibrant, with a unique blend of hop resin and roast character that melds well into the roast, yeast, and alcohol characters. Still vibrantly hoppy two years in. The roast hasnt gotten mushy or oxidized. This is a fantastic example of the style.

12oz Bottle. Thanks Sean! Re-rated 03.17.2012. I still believe this is one of the best examples of this style ever. The porter and dark malt qualities of this beer are fantastic.

The taste has some rich milk chocolate and quality coffee. There is also a little bit soybeans. The finish is toasted with some almonds. The body is silky smooth and lightly carbonated. A nice version of the style.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

The nice smooth aroma contained brown malt notes. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a mild malt bite and a malty aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of roasted malt and sweet. Delicious and one I would certainly buy again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

1496,"2006-07-24",4.2,"Michigan BGF 06 Day 2: One of my favorites of the weekend. Nearly opaque with purple-ish highlights topped by a small beige head. The aroma has notes of Irish Whisky, heavy toasted and peaty malt vapors, liquorice, wild berry, slightly nutty and earthy yeast esters. Brilliant!!! The palate found a nice whisky bite on top of a sweet sticky malt base. The finish has a light bitterness, plum, and a smoky aftertaste. Very well balanced and yummy.  The mouth feel is smooth, oily and lush with just enough sharpness around the edges to keep you engrossed. I am not sure the ABV but it well hidden. A wonderful expression of brewers art. I hope they brew this again. Almost Baltic in nature and such a lovely sipping brew.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
