946,"2012-07-24",3.5,"On tap at the brewpub.  Deep amber-copper color.  Nose is lightly sweet caramel and toasted malt.  Flavor initially showcases the caramel/toasted malt backbone but gives way to an herbal/wood/earthy hop flavor that cuts through the mild sweetness and draws out into the finish.  Nice character and palate presence.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
946,"2012-06-09",4.1,"A light brown clear with lacing off white head.  Smell of hints of carmel and spicy notes.  A well drinkable beer.","","whitebear"
946,"2009-12-08",3.1,"(Draught)  Pours a clear golden body with a medium off-white head.  Aroma of mustiness, grain, grass, and nuts.  Flavor of nuts, grain, biscuit, and caramel malt with a dry, bitter finish.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
946,"2009-09-20",4.0,"Draft at the OF.  Orange brown-tan color, looks filtered.  Nice foamy beige head.  Malty aroma with a touch of citrus fruit.  Crisp and woody, with a nice sandy dark malt sharp aftertaste.  This really hits the spot, capturing the best parts of Brown Ale, Lager, and hoppy APA all in one.  Quite astringent and soapy at times, but still achieves an excellent balance with the deeper dark malts.  This is a great California Common!","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"

Full of nutty and lager-like aromas it is lightly carbonated, and rich in malt flavor. a very long, lingering hop finish compliments this fairly strong tasting beer.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","phishpond417"

946,"2007-11-23",3.6,"Got the last glass served on draught at the brewpub/restaurant in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Pours a semi-clear amber brew with a fast dissolving off-white head that leaves behind a fine film and thin ring. Some spotty lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel and light bread malt, a touch of citrus zest and some dried light fruit. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonation with fruity flavors of caramel malt and light citrus zest. Finish is slightly dry at first and then clean cut.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
