4403,"2017-03-08",3.4,"Good brownish beige head, stable, over brownish highlighted black beer. Sweet, and melanoidinrich nose, molasses, faint roasted coffee, Haagse Hopjes . Bitter, dry, felt, melanoidins, husks - perpendicular on the nose. Long bitterish, even hoppy aftertaste; only the MF hinting at smooth and dark malts or sugar, with even a hint at lactose. Dry, medium carbonation. I dont like the nose pointing so much in the wrong direction. But it is out of discussion that I do like the flavours. Whatever the explanation, the name of the beer is silly.  Thanks, Jezza!","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
