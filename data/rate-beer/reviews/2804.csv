2804,"2017-06-15",2.9,"On tap @ The Gingerman. This one has a blurry golden colored body. A nice big lasting just off-white head, hefty in the lacing department. On the nose its surprisingly pleasant. Not for a HF beer, but for a larger. Soft hay, a little grain. Hop presence, even some malts. Not a massive aroma but it smells nice. Thin stuff in the taste. Well, both in the taste and in the mouth actually. Watery texture vise and about averages on the carbonation. Thin grainy and quote soapy in the taste. Have to admit it tastes clean though.

In the mouth the hops become more present playing a counter-balancing, bittering role to the malt. The flavour is quite assertive and relatively well-balanced making it a rare bird for the style. At first I mistook the assertiveness for farmhouse but recalibration of the palate with water enabled me to recognise the cereals and noble hop bitterness for what it was.

Taste is quite a bit hoppier. Earthy and a little grassy. Grainy malts. Follows the nose with much more intense hop flavor. Bitter throughout the back end.
 Medium carbonation. Grainy finish. Intensely bitter, at least it seems to me. Pleasantly dry.

-The ingredients may well be German, but the mouthfeel is definitely Hill Farmstead.
-The aroma is very enticing.
-Malts also share a bite of doughy bread.
-Hops also have citrusy angles.

2804,"2014-06-11",4.6,"Growler bought 4 days ago. Very pale veiled yellow pour covered with a vigorous, stable white head. Its all there in the nose, the inviting sulphury, stoney, minty, egg shell notes which remain subtle and clean, the surprisingly aromatic hops showcasing citrus fruits and tree fruits alike (lemon, lime, grapefruit, but also pear and maybe even passion fruit) - yet these are not myrcene laden American varietals and in mouth, this starts making more sense as a green grassiness, a general herbaceous and spicy side kick in and takes a lot of room, culminating into a clean, yet firm bitterness, perhaps accentuating (or accentuated by?) the general dryness. This dryness is interesting though, as the beer, while feeling quaffable thanks in large part to the elegant crispiness, is pretty malty indeed. In spite of feeling dry on the tongue, it feels round, not filling, but certainly cerealic, bready and gently chewy rather than chubby - all this in spite of the fairly active carbonation, especially for a growler. Cool stuff, I had high expectations and this did not disappoint. While a bit stronger than your average pils, it manages to compensate its extra maltiness by well-integrated fragrant hops, and a refined texture.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

2804,"2013-05-06",4.2,"In short: An exemplary hoppy blond lager, german pilsner for the American palate.
How: Tap at Blackback Pub, Waterbury VT. (later a few growlers home).
The look: Cloudy yellow-blond body topped by a medium white head that quickly recedes to a persistent small layer of foam leaving lots of lacings on the glass.
In long: Nose is fresh cereals, noble-ish hops that emanates dry yellowed grass, lemons and even some grapefruits.  Not the usual aromatic bomb that are Hill Farmstead draught beers, this is nonetheless an very inviting aroma with an overall great freshness sensation.  Taste has the signature Hill Farmstead malt/water/mouthfeel signature similar to most of their single hop IPAs, fresh cereals (bakery bread and crackers), chewy but not doughy, low sweetness, plenty of very soft bubbles creating a voluptuous super-comfortable monthfeel.  Also a light boiled egg-white sensation which is something I somehow often get from lager yeast.  A generous hopping that is very soft on the palate, some lemongrass, sundried yellowed grass, bitter grapefruits, lemon juice.  Since Mary is a pils by the hops-obsessed Hill Farmstead I expected a denaturized hop-bomb of a pilsner, not the case here, although certainly americanized over-hopped by german pils standards I find that a fresh Prima Pils has a more assertive hop bitterness than Mary.  A superb session beer that I would like to see become a regular next to Edward in HF lineup. I ordered my beer by telling the waitress at Blackback please MARY me! and I laughed and laughed and it truly scares me how often Id punch myself in the face if I wasnt me.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2804,"2013-03-18",3.5,"750 ml growler from the HFS. Tall pils glass shows a lightly hazy straw color with ample carbonation. Sticky spider web lacing down the side.  Nose is light malt and grain. A mild hoppiness is upfront with a grassy, hay flavor and a moderate level of sweetness. Lemon and honey notes. Mild  lingering bitterness. Very light body and very refreshing. I got to say this is the best American pilsner I have ever sampled. The only other American pilsner I remember being this good was Cigar City Patio Pils. Well done Mr. Hill.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
2804,"2013-03-17",4.0,"Growler @ Rachels place, shared by Steve_0. Thanks so much- Ive been wanting to try this one for a while! Pours a hazy, light yellow orange appearance with an off white head. Sweet fruity yeasty, lemon, light tropical fruity, sweet toasted malty, cracker, lightly herbal aroma. A bit more on the sweeter/fruity side than some Pilseners, but still very enticing. Very refreshing flavor that again is a bit more on the sweet side, but I think that makes it a great session beer during a hot summer day. Lemon, light fruit cocktail, a bit grassy, somewhat herbal, light mango, quite yeasty flavor with a bit of acidity on the finish. Soft carbonation. Not what I was expecting, but fuck it (butt fuck it?), its a damn nice beer and probably would be fun as fuck to beer bong (or use for beer pong). Can you imagine filling your solo cups with this during beer pong? Holy hell, that would be an experience. Thanks again, Stephen!","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"

2804,"2013-03-16",3.8,"750 mL, swing-top at home, courtesy of Frank. Thanks again man! Pour is slightly hazy straw-colored with a big fluffy white head and great lacing. Snappy, crackery, somewhat spicy aroma - with lighter notes of grass, lemon zest, straw and biscuit. Taste is much the same - biscuity, bready, grainy, almost chewy - grass, earthy/spicy hops, lemon peel, a touch of flowers, and honey with a lightly bitter finish. Full, yet airy mouthfeel with high carbonation. I am not a huge fan of Pilseners, but this one was super-easy drinking and tasted extremely fresh. It makes me want to go to Germany and experience what a real lager is like.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"

Flavour is uber-dry, with loads of puckeringly dry grassy hops, German lager yeast quite highly pronounced, and some citric notes. Extremely dry with quite a harsh astringency. Super-refreshing with high drinkability. Excellent stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

Des saveurs délicieuses de houblons en herbes, de céréales campagnardes et de fleurs citronnées.  Une bouche légère et bien aérée.

Pours glowing straw gold with awesome miniscule bubbled head, great lasting ability and lacing. Notes were very crisp and dry, spicy pilsener, earthy hops, light malt, and a light body. Not a huge pils fan since they all taste similiar and bland for the most part, but this HF version was definitely an exception to the rule.

The nose carries a good dose of grain and barley with some light floral and perfume notes. Really well-integrated. Light but fairly complex. Really impressive and on par with the best American pilsners Ive had, which mainly consist of those coming very fresh from Victory on tap.
