3736,"2010-08-08",3.4,"Draught at the brewpub.   Dark amber brown with an off-white head.   The aroma is malty and pretty expected, with toasted grain, lightly burnt caramel, and a touch of hops.   The flavor has a malt profile that follows the aroma with toasty malt and rich dark caramel that borders on roast.   Light on the hops and sweet in balance, though not overly so.   Medium bodied with medium carbonation.   An alright amber ale with a nice rich malt profile that brings a very light roast.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

3736,"2008-10-31",3.4,"Draft @ Raccoon Lodge.  Pours the color of a penny; clear, deep copper-tan; light tan head with fine-bubbled lacing.  Wet biscuity malts and a light citrus presence in the aroma; basic and crisp.  Medium mouthfeel: biscuity maltiness, light cola, and brown sugar forming the core of things; solid malt center while staying crisp; minerals and a very light citrus at the perimeter.  I could see drinking a lot of this, but it doesn’t quite have enough to keep things interesting.  Medium finish: toasty / bready malts and minerals; nicely dry.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

3736,"2004-11-13",3.5,"2004 draught.  Thought this was an alt, it had a nice muted nutty flavor, some dusty notes, but I guess after thinking about it, there was little to no yeast apparency, no sourness.  Pretty light for an EPA, hops nowhere to be found.  Light roasted malt, mostly dry with some hints of caramel on the finish.  Great session beer, no major problems.  Medium-light body.  Aroma is lightly nutty with a soft even malt.  Great deep reddish-orange color with small off-white head.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
