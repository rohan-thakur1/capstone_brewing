3952,"2016-10-23",3.6,"Bottle - Tons of pear notes with some peel. Clear. Pear notes but the sake does pull through in the background and comes through. This is good for the style as the pear dominated but doesnt obliterate the taste of sake.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
3952,"2016-09-14",2.2,"300ml bottle, pours a pale colour. Very sweet synthetic pear nose. Flavour similar, but fairly hot. New to sake, but this should barely count. Alcopop.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiery_1"
3952,"2016-09-14",2.5,"Tasting at Matts; 12% ABVVery pale color, almost water. Aroma of pear and green walnut, rather artificial. Soft mouthfeel, rather sweet for a Sake, the pear comes through in a very artificial way, it highlights the alcohol notes; some candied fruit, green nuts, too much glue in the end.Weird.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
3952,"2016-09-14",2.1,"300mL bottle, pours a clear blonde. Aroma brings out notes of pears, white vinegar, and light boozy rice. Flavour brings out notes of glue, lots of phenols and artificial pears. Phenolic, fruity finish. Not terrible, but really cheap tasting and lacking any depth.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

3952,"2016-09-14",1.7,"Very pale. Maybe a touch of green, but other than that, clear. The pear is artificial, candyish, just not good. The base sake is bland, and god help me the fruit character is trash.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
3952,"2016-08-03",3.1,"300ml bottle from Swirl & Sip in Mosaic. Guinomi. Chilled. Clear, slightly yellowish tinge. A: fruity, definite pear presence. Nice. T: pear, melon, floral notes. Oily and boozy. OK.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","DCLawyer"
3952,"2015-01-29",3.0,"I dont really know how to judge sake as Im not a big sake drinker on the norm. This was nice clean and clear. Hints of melon and fruit with some rice.","North Dakota, USA","GreatDane1632"
3952,"2014-12-07",3.4,"Ive had this bottle of sake for quite some years now. Id pretty much forgotten about it, but saw it tonight and thought what the heck. I dont recall where I got this bottle, but I dont think it was from when I toured the sake company in 2011. The sake pours to a chardonnay wine colored body with long lasting legs. The aroma is mostly floral rice and Jasmin. The flavor is floral rice with very subtle fruity pear and melon. Palate isnt lingering or overbearingly sweet.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
3952,"2014-11-27",3.1,"Simple, typical clear pour, nice pear enhancing a typical sake flavor. Good with sushi and Korean.","Ephrata, Pennsylvania, USA","djaquay"
3952,"2014-05-18",3.8,"Moonstone Asian Pear Sake is a pretty tasty beverage. Intoxicating pear aroma coming from the clear, slightly yellow liquid. The pear taste comes through with a slight alcohol bite. Not bad for a Thai restaurant drink.","Orlando, Florida, USA","sloshgator"
3952,"2013-02-26",2.0,"this pours clear light white wine yellow. Notes of rice wine and apple juice on the nose. Drinks with rice wine up front, 1/10-sweetnes (quite dry), then this heavy onset of aggressive alcohol - though not burning but invasive, mixed with aromas of red apple, kinda-pear-kinda-not, and a roughish alcoholic rice wine finish. This doesnt taste very vibrant/bright/fresh/elegant. Do not like.","","sulawang"
3952,"2012-08-01",1.8,"Pours clear oily, maybe a tint of olive. Smell strong pear and candy, passionfruit and guava. Taste strong boozy with a hint of fruit. Overpowering mouthfeel. Not a fan.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Smurf2055"
3952,"2012-05-03",2.2,"Bottle. Cold. Strong asian pear aroma. Taste develops a bit with some vanilla, lychee and melon notes. The flavors read thin and artificial.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","NikkTwist"

3952,"2011-04-09",3.0,"Clear pour tiny legs looks like sake. Aroma of pear skins & a touch of candied sugar along with hints if alcohol and an odd back if the nose astringency.  Pal is a bit thin.  Tastes are mellow soft and sweet.  A good amount of pear sweet in the swallow but more subtle on first sip.  A decent but not great sake.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"

3952,"2010-12-28",2.7,"Clear. Aroma is vanilla, rice and a little bit of pear. Flavor is rice and alcohol with a touch of pear and apple sweetness. The fruit component is much less than in any of the other infused sakes I have had. Not bad, but nothing to seek out.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
3952,"2010-12-28",2.7,"Bottle courtesy mora2000. Pours very clear. No real coloring to this or carbonation. Aroma is faint, but slightly fruity. Flavor is dry fruit, some tartness and dry paper. Weird finish.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"
3952,"2010-01-23",3.1,"(750 ml bottle from Hallowell Seafood) Pours clear very pale yellow. Aroma of apple/pear, yeast, rice and bread. Mouthfeel smooth, light, kind of warm and lightly sticky. Flavor is sweet with notes of light fruit - apple and pear. A bit of yeast, rice and alcohol. Fairly quickly fatiguing palate - one sip does not necessarily invite another. The ""infused""/flavored part is not really that objectionable. I think its more that the basic sake component here is not that great.","Boothbay, Maine, USA","porterhouse"
3952,"2008-10-19",1.9,"This is the other infused sake available at my local grocery store, and definitely an inferior species compared to the Moonstone Plum sake.  It is a completely clear brew accompanied by an incredibly scant scent of light cream and an almost intangible light pear sweetness, but not recognizable as a fruit of any kind.  It certainly isnt as sweet as the plum wine, as if its brewing was led by an entirely different team with entirely different goals.  This sake tastes more faint, boozy and strangely, somewhat soapy.  Again, the pear flavor is but a shadow of its original fruit self, warped into an unrecognizable phenotype by the sake brewing process.  The sweetness takes the first half of the taste, then dips into a complete, textured blank.  The Asian Pear Sake finishes with a long unripe pear flavor, then settles into a whispered soapy off-taste.  Although this is more recognizably sake than the plum sake, thats not saying much.  Its  definitely doesnt deserve a place in sake collection.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
3952,"2008-07-22",3.1,"Bottle, served chilled.  Clear pour with a fruity aroma that is not much different from a ’normal’ sake.  Has a sweet fruity flavor, texture is a little different, seems a little thicker than most.  Pretty good, not harsh at all.","Tallahassee (and Poconos, PA), Florida, USA","Guinness4Duff"
3952,"2008-07-08",3.6,"Very clear pour.  This could easily be mistaken for water.  Very enjoyable aroma.  Musty and clean at the same time (I dont know how else to say that) with just a light fruit presence.  The flavor is pretty clean as well.  Fruity and floral but delicately so.  Its good.  Clean wet mouth feel.  Id drink this again.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"
3952,"2008-07-07",2.6,"Pours still and clear with a yellow tint.  Spells of sweet rice, vanilla, some pear.  Tastes like a rice wine with some hint of pear.  Meh.  I tried a whole bunch of these but this is the only one that had an English label and I have no desire to figure out what the others were just for a ""tick"".","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
3952,"2008-04-09",3.1,"Pours non-bubbly champagne color. Aroma is rice, malt, soy sauce, faint pear. Taste is sort of the same but kind of like a rice flavored perry without the sweetness or carbonation. Overall this is very mellow. My parents would love this because its pleasingly soft to the senses and palate.","Washington DC, USA","zebracakes"
3952,"2008-03-22",3.4,"Courtesy of Naka. So Ive tried many saké before this, but Ive never rated one. The bottle has been passed around and was open for a bit, but stored in the fridge until this evening, when I took it out to come to room temperature before enjoying. This one has a delicate aroma, with a bit of alcohol vapor, pear juice, and mild vanilla. Also perhaps a bit of jasmine or honeysuckle in there, too. Light and enjoyable nose. Crystal clear body, with just a bit of yellowish tint to it, light white grape juice but not even as dark. Mild watery body, like a white wine, with obvioulsy no carbonation. Very smooth, with no snappy acidity or odd bitterness on the palate. Starts fairly sweet and fruity, with vanilla, oak, and pear being the predominant flavors. Just a little bit of fruity acidity, but mild. Light alcoholic warming toward the end. Watery and mild, but very enjoyable. Leaves a light fruity taste, with even a bit of rose water. Im going to have to seek out more saké to try.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"
3952,"2008-02-21",3.9,"Courtesy of Naka.  This is my first Sake rating/experience with good Sake.  Pours clear with yellow tint.  Sweet nose with hints of apple and pear, and what must be rice.  Some alcohol also on the nose.  Taste is sweet fruit, pear, apple, and cherry, with what I guess is rice and some alcohol warmth.  Tasty offering.  Im now officially interested in Sake.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","dpjuart"
3952,"2008-02-15",3.2,"Color of light green tea.  Very faint.  Light cherry and pear aroma with rice and alcohol.  A very mild peachy plum flavor with a good deal of alcohol taste.  Odd mouthfeel that seems watery to start, but then has a sort of syrupy finish.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Naka"

3952,"2007-12-07",1.5,"Bottle: Pours with the appearance of water. Completely lucid, and almost colorless. Sweet medicinal aroma. The fruitiness is predominately banana, with old rotted fruit suggestions. Theres some band-aid in there as well. The flavor is mild, but medicinal. Has lots of rotted fruits (banana predomintely) and some edd grainy rice note in the finish. Didnt really get much pear in there. One of my first times trying a Sake, and my first to rate. Perhaps my taste for Sakes needs to develop...","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"
3952,"2007-10-09",3.0,"Didnt detect a whole lot of pear in the aroma. Lots of sweet rice, though. Only  the tiniest hint of pear must. Pouring into the glass almost looked like water. The smallest hint of shimmering yellow when held up to the light. Sweet creamy rice on the palate with some tropical notes. Just a bit of pear flavor detected. Soft and creamy on the palate. Finishes quite dry with a small alcohol bite.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
3952,"2007-09-08",3.1,"This infused Sake pours a nearly clear, but there is a touch of yellowish green tint, from a corked 200ml bottle. No head. Aroma is melons, some pears and some wood. Light body. Flavors seem more melon and wood than pear. The pear is there but kind of subtly drift in and out the mix. Very clean tasting. The 13% alcohol is only noticeable at the very finish or when you swish some around in your mouth. Subtle flavors, starts sweet, with a dry middle and a clean finish. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet with a lingering alcohol taste","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

3952,"2007-06-08",2.9,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2008 The aroma is fantastic for a sake. There is a soft fruity element that contains the requisite  pear and also rice. The appearance is yellow clear. The flavor is sweet and fruity with pear dominating. The palate is thin and light. This is almost like a perry. Nice.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
3952,"2007-01-01",4.6,"Pale green, ever so slightly hazy body.  Extremely delicate scent of pear.  Water-like palate and faint flavour of rice and pear with a breath of alcohol on the end.  A very reserved, proper sort of sake.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","starfireming"

3952,"2006-05-24",2.7,"From my notes, April 06. Clear color, fruity aroma. Very sweet sake, almost no dry sensation. Asian pear is definitely an underlying flavor, not prominent at all. Still a good sake though. Medicine-like palate, but not in a bad way.

Slight alcohol in the aroma with some ripening melons in the back end. Flavor has some ""pears soaked in vodka"" taste to it with some sweet sugary, fruity candy notes - odd for a sake. Clean, even mouthfeel, 13.5% abv hidden extremely well. Overall, decent.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
3952,"2005-10-02",3.1,"Bottle.  Pours with just the slightest hint of straw/golden color.  Light pear aroma, I assume that the pear addition is mellowing out the stereotypical ""jet-fuel"" sake aroma.  Very mellow smelling.  Light in flavor and mouthfeel.  A bit of pear in taste.  Alcohol is blended in quite nicely.  Nothing super exciting, but easy to drink.","Alabama, USA","11026"
