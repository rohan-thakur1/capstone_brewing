3678,"2017-03-11",3.6,"Bottle, 22oz, shared by bergstaden. Its an unclear dark reddish colored beer with a dense, minimal sized off-white head. Hop-dusty, piney and resiny aroma with toffee and roasted malts. Some dried fruits, prunes and raisins. Its full-bodied, warming and smooth on the palate, with a decent bitterness. Roasted malts, booze, toffee and dried fruits in the flavor, then even more bitterness chiming in. Lasting finish with lots of booze and bitterness. Sweetness too, but not too much. Delicious indeed, but Id prefer it at a lower ABV. 170311","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

3678,"2016-01-27",4.7,"(En fût à Stout Burger L.A): Le liquide est magnifique avec sa couleur sang/acajou et sa mousse onctueuse et tenace. En bouche une tarte aux pommes et cerises, des houblons épicés et une pâte damandes sortie de nulle part atténue la chaleur mordante. La vanilline de barrique enrobe tellement adéquatement. World class.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"

3678,"2015-11-19",4.0,"Bomber from Bine & Vine. Pours ruddy, very hazy, brownish with a slight tan head. Aroma of ""freshly oxidized"" malt, darkish fruits, and bourbon. Full bodied or nearly. Its bourbon and alcohol forward, with lots of darker fruit; the oxidized part seems to not be present? Damn tasty stuff. Dark fruits soaked in bourbon with some treacle enhancement. Liking it!","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
3678,"2015-11-06",4.1,"Sampled at GABF 2015. In the tasting glass clear reed with a tan head. Nose of caramel malts, wood, dark ripe fruit, citrus, and bourbon. Full body. Flavor is really rich and fruit is first, then oak wood, followed by bourbon on a smooth roasted caramel malt base. Well balanced and delicious. Love this one. When I get home I will pick up some bottles as this is local.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
