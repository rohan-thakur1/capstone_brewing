No head, just some bubbles, nice slightly cloudy reddish golden color. Aroma is slightly sweet yeasty, very ripe banana, yeast, minerals, sap, overripe yellow apples, grass, caramel, bubblegum. Taste is slightly sweet fruity, yeast, fruit stones, minerals, banana, weeds, grass, hay, almond essence, banana peel, sap, bark, sugar. Medium bitterness, slightly harsh yeasty mouthfeel.

2168,"2017-05-02",3.0,"500ml PET bottle courtesy of japppp for EU local swap 2/2017, cheers Jussi!murky bright amber-brown with no head. quite sweet and full of esters on the nose. to taste theres spicy grainy notes, a touch of musty oxidation, lots of sweetness and some herbal juniper notes. Quite a lot of clovey yeast phenolics resulting in something a bit like a sweet dunkelhefe. Definitely interesting to try but will reserve judgement on style until i try some other examples - perhaps on draught.","NORTHERN IRELAND","Beersiveknown"
2168,"2017-04-12",3.6,"0,75cl PET bb02/2017, sampled 03/2017, merci Mirka! - This one might have slightly turned in transit, but is still drinkable with enough oddness to hold the attention: its landed somewhere between a dusty Weizenbock and a harsh geuze, both pepped behind the scenes of their respective terroir brown bars with a shot of genever. - - Expectedly no-nonsense in the looks dpt, beige dough with lots of UFOs and trub. - Lovely doughy bread flavours and most of that banana sweetness devoured by lacto, not a bad thing overall. Sweet bread, dry heather honey, juniper sneaking in from the back and staying around. The wild dimension here is very shrubby, else hard to place and only partly superseded by the new lacto sourness. Ergo: enjoyed half a bottle, used the other half to spice up & make more vivid beers that were too sweet...Glad to have finally tried this.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

I know it is the style but the combination of cold, flat and watery doesnt sit so well in the mouth. The ABV is evident in the finish and aftertaste.

>> Pours a flatter murky/opaque burnt amber with essentially no foam and little to no carbonation. Nose at first is quite estery with baked apple, dark bread, and browned banana. Hefeweizen came to mind for all that sampled this with me. Taste..at first it was quite sweaty, a tad metallic, and really sweet approaching cloying. Wife picked up a Gin and juniper bite but I did not. Really thought it lacked balanced. Flavors came through of dark bread roll, brown sugar, and brown banana. No fusel alcohol, but abv is apparent while sampling with some obvious warming. As it sahti gets to room temperature, I think the sourness in the finish really comes through. The palate gains an almost rustic, dark Berliner Weisse flavor. Flashes of sour mash grain, lemon, lime. The acid balancing this one out finally. It becomes quite enjoyable. To be honest, I ended up finishing everyones glass because they did not like it, but I really did. Funny, since from the first sip I was not initially impressed.

A fair amount of trub in the feet of the bottle... A gentle pour yields a honey amber that is still slightly hazy.  Unfortunatly as I alluded to above, the beer was still.  This fact did subtract from the total score.  First taste was taken with some trepidation since most still beers turn out to be absolute swill.  This was not the case with this brew.  Clove and banana in nose an body.  finish was led by sweet lemon cookie citrus.  8% was not noticable.  Caramel malts abounded.  Carbonation would have made this a great beer.

As with its bigger sibling theres lots of banana and clove in the aroma, but this one is a touch softer overall with no notable alcohol to my nose.  Waves of cotton candy, juniper and light smoke run across the aroma, followed by plums, tannins, butterscotch and caramel.  The butterscotch-diacetyl aroma strengthens with warmth.  Also, a strong honey-waxy element comes into its own.  The flavour begins very sweet, a touch smoky and heavily fruity (bananas, peaches) and transitions to a slightly drier and still fruity, smoky finish with a light dose of warming alcohol.  Medium-full body with a slick texture and no carbonation.  Bananas, butterscotch, juniper and smoke linger long into the finish.  Interesting just like the strong sahti, perhaps a little more drinkable, still nothing that truly resonates with me.

2168,"2005-11-15",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 16, 2005 (750 ml bottle: Obtained in trade with bogdi1, thanks Juha!, and shared with SDbruboy) This is easily one of the most incredible treats Ive experienced since I began rating beer twelve years ago.  Not only because this is wonderfully delicious, but also because tasting a traditional Sahti is a brand new experience for me, and its such a rare treat to get to taste this on this side of the Atlantic.  Ive tasted an American beer that is inspired by Sahti (Southampton Juhlia) but while that Southampton beer is very tasty, its quite different from what Juha has sent me from Finland.  Understanding that freshness is of the utmost importance with this style, I must point out that Juha bought this bottle immediately prior to mailing it to me, it took at most a week to arrive, and its being consumed another week later, so this bottle cant be more than three weeks old.  I cant speak the language, but I see ""Parasta Ennen: 13 -11-"" on the label, so Im making the assumption that this should be consumed by, well, TODAY!  Woohoo!  Anyway, pouring this into a tulip glass, its dark orange-amber in color and very cloudy, and a small half-inch off-white head forms within a few seconds.  I took my first sniff and initially thought ""Saison"", but I quickly realized that this is much closer to a German Hefeweizen, but with a twist.  It shows an amazing aroma of sweet, ripe banana and spices that seem close to clove and nutmeg to me, but there is also a pleasant sour aroma to balance out the sweetness.  Very aromatic indeed, unique, savory, I can just keep sniffing my Sahti all night.  Continuing on with this delectable Finnish gift, the flavor shows similar characteristics, lots of sweet banana and bubblegum, plenty of spice, but the citrus and green apple tartness is more apparent on the tongue than in the nose, easily balancing the sweetness.  The sweet banana tends to fade a bit toward the finish, and while the spices hold steady, the tartness exerts a bit of muscle, showing some dominance in the finish.  I also get a slight smokiness in the finish after awhile.  So not only does the tartness balance the sweetness, it keeps the palate refreshed.  Body seems about medium ""plus"" to me, but again, the tartness seems to help lighten the body somewhat.  Carbonation is good and theres a bit of zest and tang on the palate as well.  Though the head settles to a filmy layer, there is plenty of patchy and spotty lacing scattered all over the glass.  Sadly, Ive come to the end of this session as I only have an ounce left in my glass, and then finally pouring the liquidy sediment into my glass, hoping for another taste, this is now amazingly sour, wow!  Its sad how Im trying to savor this, preserve the last remaining drops for as long as possible, knowing it will be quite a long time before I get to partake in this wonderful Finnish beverage again, and hopefully its a matter of when, not if.  Thank you, Juha, once again for sending this to me, you will forever be a friend.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Flavor is also sweet and fruity with banana up front and then turning somewhat sour as the sweetness fades into tart fruits  Full body, smooth mouthfeel and mildly carbonated.  Quite nice!","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"
2168,"2005-10-04",3.8,"Sweet, woody aroma with some yeastiness.  Opaque browned copper body is still and somewhat viscous and oily looking.  Very sweet, woody, floral flavour with strong cakelike yeast.  Medium body with smooth, sticky texture and no carbonation.  I think I like it, but would love to try some more to be sure.  Bottle sampled at RBESG 2005.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"

2168,"2005-09-27",4.0,"Ya, ya, I know, its irresponsible to review this style, especially having been shipped across the Atlantic and given that this is a style that is a definite ""must consume fresh"". Oh well, I want to share my thoughts on the beer, so Im going to. Sampled this bottle courtesy of my friend Juha over in Finland, at Candace and Todds wedding party on 9/24/2005.
Pours a rather cloudy (you cant get this beer to become clear, no matter how long it sits, we tried), but yet bright, orange-yellow, medium-large sized bubbles breaking to the surface, lazily, here and there. Smattering of white bubbles on the edges, and some wispy foam on top that disippates almost immediately. There is some sparse lacing, more like sticky liquid coating down the glass than actual white foam. Aroma has the lovely sour, vinegar-like acidity, rotten pears and peaches, light woodiness and moss, with a hint of vanilla, spoiled tangerines and of course the huge shot of juniper spiciness (tartness, really). Lightly funky, a touch of cheesiness and really quite inviting to yours truly.
The beer poured at the top of the bottle was quite bright flavored, still very vinegary/sour and full of juniper and light cheese, but the flavors go well with a light, moderately sweet, not-quite-caramel flavor, a bit of light bready/doughiness and some lemon sugar cookies. But then its quickly back to the sour citric elements, strong vinegar and almost wet, oily cedarwood like notes. Mouthfeel is fairly loose, with large bubbles giving it a fairly broken feel; this is no tightly carbonated gueuze. But no matter, it does not seem watery or thin, just lightly bubbly and a little loose on the edges.
At the bottom of the bottle its a different story, mixing in the MASSIVE amount of sediment, which can not be helped. Muddy, completely opaque and very challenging in appearance, the beer takes on not what I would have expected (a dull, blander quality), a massively more sour, bitter and astringent flavor. Yikes! This is some seriously sour stuff at the end and makes yours truly cringe after finishing it. Oily, highly sour/tart. Like biting in to unripened juniper berries, perhaps. Still, there is a lightly bittersweet flavor that somehow allows me to enjoy it.
Very interesting stuff, I enjoyed it more than the Strong Sahti, to be honest.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
2168,"2005-09-13",3.0,"Bottle. A bit more bareable than the strong version. This is still quite sweet and sticky, with a clovey character, and lots of banana esters. Perhaps a touch to sweet for me.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"

2168,"2004-06-11",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2014 Bottle conditioned (BB 07/2004)
Dark hazy orange amber color. No head. Smokey strong banana flavor. Dry but sweetish palate: banana, juniper and alcohol dominate the flavor. Aftertaste is warm and this gives a dry mouthfeel. (7/2/3/2/8 2.2)
Re-rate:
after keeping half empty bottle in the fridge two days, sweet banana flavor came up and palate got more balanced, so those ratings came up a bit. (7/2/5/3/11 2.8)
The beer of the year in HBF 1999 and 2003.
Re-rate at brewery. 
Since the earlier ratings this has changed location and brewer. I have had it few times on tap. Now extremely drinkable. Banana with nice juniper spiceyness in balance.","Pori, FINLAND","TBone"

Sweet and malty, strongly bananaish, grainy and ryeish flavor with dried fruit and some ashy smokiness in the finish. Quite well-hidden alcohol. Medium-bodied, rough (particles) palate with flat carbonation. A pleasant and balanced, easily drinkable sahti.
