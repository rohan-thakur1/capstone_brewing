Creamy body, smooth, velvety, hides that big 10% amongst layers of sticky malt & complexity.
Lovely body - plenty of sweetness with notes of sultana, prune, dark sugars & burnt caramels, toast & nuts, counterpointed tangy plum & cherry esters & somewhat savoury clove, pepper & nutmeg spice. Bitterness lifted for style but well measured, warming but very subtle on a long smooth finish.

A krémesség foka egyre nő, ízjegyek formájában elevenednek meg az előbbi hangulatok, s már az első korty alkalmával elismerően nyugtázhatjuk, mennyire értenek a belgák a letisztult vonalak alkalmazásához főzeteik szerkezetének kialakításakor. Csípőskés testét quadrupel-szerű karakterek tarkítják, vaníliás lepelbe burkolt aszalványok sorakoznak fel, vörösboros pátosz nehezedik rájuk, a gabonás alapokon így csúsznak tovább selymesen és könnyedén, légiesnek tüntetve fel a mázsás súlyú főzetet.","HUNGARY","adster"

2321,"2014-10-15",3.7,"Location: Draft at Morrisons, 10/15/14, Palindromic Rating #4004!


Aroma: This ale has a very sweet aroma, there is heavy toffee, with some caramel, and dark fruit

Appearance: It pours a reddish brown color with a tan head and some drippy, coating lace

Flavor: Tastes heavy sweet, similar to the nose component-wise, with no bitterness to speak of

Palate: This is a rather full bodied offering, it feels fairly sticky, and finishes with some mild heat

Overall Impression: 
I love me some palindromic rating numbers!  Anyway, this is a solid, strong, sweet brew.  The alcohol hides well under the heavy sweetness, which is impressive at 10-12% (was listed at 12% on the chalk board at the bar, and is listed as 10% on here).

A: Aggressive carbonation when opened. The foam practically jumped off the bottle... However, after pouring it, the beige head was medium with small retention and no lacings are left. As a traditional Des Rocs, the body is dense and dirty full of yeasts floating around
S: Traditional Belgian dark ale. Very fruity and yeasty. Notes of plums. Bready too. Shake it a bit and the perfume jumps out to the nose. Caramel malts and some hops. Bit liquorous. Pure pleasure
T: Taste follows the nose. Quite fruity. Plums and raisins are there. Complex and spicy. Sweet upfront. Light bitter end. Strong taste of Belgian yeasts and a peculiar ash aftertaste

Taste: very sweet, with caramel, toffee, crème brulee, cherries in heavy syrup, candi sugar, raisins, prunes, fig, light bourbon, clove, and cinnamon spice.  Finish: lingering sweet flavors like an oatmeal raisin cookie, with yeasty notes growing more prominent.  Notes: Bottle was best before 2-22-2014, so about 7 months past. Possibly explains the gusher and appearance, although at 10% youd think it would keep a little better. In spite of the frankly gross appearance, this had a great aroma and wonderful, deep flavors.

2321,"2014-04-10",4.1,"This is a very complex, intriguing dark tripel. Pours amber/orange with a thick beige head that lingers, lots of sediment when you hold it to the light. Aroma is of caramel, sweet malt, dark bread, nuts, plum, cherry, and an attic in an old house. Taste is medium sweet and mildly bitter, very fruity, complex, and balanced. Has a silky mouthfeel, although it looks aggressively carbonated in the glass. Has vinous qualities, like a good port. Long, mellow, sweet finish. Has a best before date of Feb 16, 2013 on the bottle but I think it isnt too old, the age has probably improved the flavor.

Thanks to tastybeer for sharing this with b3shine and myself. Despite a considerable amount of sediment in the bottle this was a solid beer. I thought I had tried it before but it must be one of those beers Ive always walked past until it was no longer for sale.

Aroma / Appearance - Heavy chunks of yeast from a year or more of aging give it an unappealing look. When it finally (somewhat) clears the body has a pleasant caramel color. Cherry pie, red vines, caramel brownies, and dark fruits provide a mixture of good flavors from which to start.

Flavor / Palate - Caramel, spice, and chocolate are very smooth when not swallowing a chunk of thick yeast. Working around that it leads to a warm finish. The booziness isnt too intense yet manages to become evident about halfway through the glass. If not for the issue of sediment this would be a clear 4.0+.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The aroma featured a nice array of floral notes mixed with some dark fruits and a candy and sugar effect as well, but could have been a bit more pronounced.

A: Pours a dark reddish amber with a finger of off-white head. The head quickly recedes to a lasting partial coat and ring. Even the first pour provided a load of suspended sediment, some of which rose and fell in swirls due to the carbonation. Very peculiar looking and not so appealing. The sediment was not detectable by feel. 

S: Very complex aroma; one of those rare beers where it seems a bit different every time a take a sniff/sip. The high ABV is most apparent here, being quite well hidden in tasting and in the gently warming feel. 

T: Mildly spicy and sweet, with hints of dark honey, nutmeg, cinnamon, dark bread, figs, and roast nuts. Very nice balance between dark fruitiness, mild sweetness and spices.

M: Medium-full thickness; creamy smooth; medium and very soft carbonation.

Even worst than the rusty water tasting hops I despise. After a few sips, it thankfully goes away and shows some caramel malt, hints of dark fruits, toffee and nuts. All mild, nicely not being too sweet. No show of alcohol, so no burning. Weird to see a dark Tripel (feels more like a Quadrupel).

4.0 S: This is a lot less tame than the Bruin I just had, but still smells great. Lots of fruits including apple, vinous red grape and raisin, plum, and currant. A little boozy, but nothing not to be expected. Toasty, grainy malts. Faintly spicy with pepper and some yeastiness.

4.0 T: Again this is vinous and perhaps surprisingly so. Muscat grape, raisin, plum, currant, red apple, and dates. Light booze. Toasty and grainy malts. Light, but sufficient sweetness. Light pepper spiciness. Yeast.

5.0 M: Light body. Very nice spritzy carbonation. Nice and creamy. Super smooth. Great here.

2321,"2012-05-21",4.9,"To brew good beer, you have to drink good beer. While I believe that I could possibly clone this beer at some point in the future, I spent last weeks Saturday brewing a pale and enjoying a bottle of this fine Belgian. 

First, this is unfiltered to some extremity. Typically, the first step in creating a clone is in acquiring its yeast; that wouldnt be a problem with this brew. Yeast was suspended throughout the beer, pendling a high viscosity and tremendous mouthfeel and body, even with little or no agitation. There is no way to avoid having a mouthful of bread-tan culture lodged in the teeth after consumption. 

Appearance was deep, opaque amber, with natural yeast carbonation, mostly from the walls of the glass.

Big, mildly roasted malt character, with an emphasis of toasted nuts and raisins, without losing the candi sugar character that should dominate the style. While I have read reviews with leather, banana, sulfur-ish, and skunky flavors present, I wonder how many received a mistreated masterpiece. No off-flavors present to my palate.

Hops were almost entirely muted, barely riding the finish of the beer after a long and complex transition. 

Aroma was intense and prevailed in bread and an effervescent citrus. 

LOL Paired well with hamburgers. Everything does? We had no choice in the matter, as our host brewer has prepared ahead of time and had no prior knowledge of pairing. 

I look forward to my next bottle and will ranch the yeast to prepare for exercises in futility. Anyone out there speak Flemish?","","bearhandfu"

The head never quite makes it all the way across the top of the glass and what is there vanishes quick.  Looks like cola.  Smells like rum cake, dried dark fruit, dried figs, and very raisiny as it warms up.  The flavor is a little tinny with lots of dark fruit and sweetness up front.  Surprisingly dry on the back end for how viscous it feels up front.  Beside the raisin notes, there is tobacco, and there is a sort of scorched gingerbread flavor.  Rich mouthfeel with low carbonation leading to weird, slightly bitter finish.  I keep trying to figure this one out, but never get there.

Aroma is full of tobacco, dark fruit, dough, spiced bread, toffee, molasses, basement/wet leaf/earthy yeast. Taste is sweeter than expected with a light tart element. Im not really sure about this one. I had built it up a lot in my mind because the Brune was insanely awesome. Now that I go back to the aroma after taking a few sips, I am getting more funky lemon tartness from it. Maybe an off bottle, I will definitely try this again. Still good, but I really dont think this is a perfect representation of the beer. Medium-light body, kind of thin texture, high carbonation.

Either way the spiciness is striking and the beer has a bit of alcohol hotness right up front that eventually melds its self better into the beer becoming a nice complimentary flavor. The beer is really pretty dry for all the fruitiness and alcoholic strength. Plenty of autumnal nuttiness and mild roastiness show up as the beer warms this all sort of progresses into fruity pear and cherry notes. The mouthfeel is full but this doesnt come off as particularly viscous. 
My goodness I forget how much I enjoy some of these dark Belgian Strong Ales. This is a beautiful beer.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

Nose is molasses/syrup, apples, brown sugar, and a touch of belgian yeast and hops. Flavor is a rich clinic in sugars and yeast (not at all a surprise given the amount of sediment), with the malt more similar to a simple medley of sugars than to frutiness. Some bread quality is also present. Backside is both a little spiced and a little sour. Never noticed the 10% ABV in the flavor. Finish is very sticky and sweet.

2321,"2011-06-27",4.1,"As a caveat, the bottle Im reviewing expired a year and a half ago. Nothing seemed to be terribly wrong,  or skunked, but mouthfeel and the chunkiness of the yeast may have been a little off.

Pours a medium brown with modest cream-colored head that disappeared quickly. Very large chunks of yeast (?) floating around and sticking to the sides of the glass. Looked a little gross, but I honestly couldnt detect the large chunks as I drank it.

Aroma is awesome: dried fruits like raisin, dark cherry, apple. Flavor is again dried fruit, with sugars and caramel, a little spiciness. Wonderfully rich and balanced.

Very mild finish. Alcohol taste almost completely absent.

2321,"2011-06-20",3.8,"750 ml Bottle; Pour is the most ridiculous thus far in my career. I open the bottle, tilt it to pour, and the liquid pauses in spite of gravity in the neck for a moment. Why? Because this bottle has so many giant turds of yeast present that I actually pulled out a strainer for it to pull out the big, brown pieces floating around. I was thinking to myself; ""perhaps they added raisins to each bottle..... no, that cant be right"" Anyway - This brew is murky brown with amber highlights in this glass ; the beige head starts off modestly and doesnt retain well at all; very light, spotty lacing is present in this glass. Because of my straining, the amount of yeast present went from giant dark brown blobs to more typical beige sediment, at least more typical for me. Anyway - The nose is dark fruits and light spices, coupled with belgian sugars. The flavor profile brings out some of this yeast; raisins, light booze, belgian sugars, and a light breadiness is present as well. I enjoyed the beer as I expected, and would be interested to try it again from a smaller, newer bottle honestly.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

Pours dark brown with a slight head that falls to a thin collar and a galaxy cap. Spins out to a thin collar throughout. The nose is not clearly as sweet as the Brune. There is a stronger plum/prune character with some very slight spice. There is some grape in the nose. The taste is dry without too much sweetness. A bit of mild earthy character; maybe some slight hints of tobacco. There are plum and dark fruits as well. Mild date character. The finish is a bit too dry and mildly astringent. Strange, somewhat-sharp dryness there. No booze at all, which is quite impressive. Drinkable but nowhere near the level of the Brune.

2321,"2011-01-02",4.0,"300 ml bottle, BB date reads 20. December 2012, into baby Chimay (180 ml) chalice. Pours sparkling beige head that slowly recedes (later pours exhibit less head retention) to a firm cloth atop of hazy, deep coppery-brown body with loads of tiny yeast particles. The floaties are not loathsome by any means and only enhance the natural aspects of the beer. Aroma is rich malty sweetness with honeyish notes, fruity esters of plum, raisin and dried cherries, nutmeg-like spiciness, faint peppery phenolics and nearly imperceptible alcohol. Flavor is rich, almost Mucih-type like malty sweetness with bready overtones, dried dark fruits, nutmeg and subtle bitterness, however, the balance is entirely towards the malt. Finishes sweet. Medium to full bodied, viscous and creamy with soft carbonation, tends to coat the lips with gooish sweet film.

2321,"2010-01-22",4.0,"( 750ml bottle) This beer pours an absolutely beautiful ruby/rust/orange color, but only a 1 finger head. Lacing is impeccable. Nose of caramel, sweet malt, and hints of dark fruit. Alcohol is present as well, but subdued. Taste of caramel, sweet malt, mild hoppy bitterness that is exceptionally balanced with the malt almost where it isnt detectable, and it is sweet. Maybe slightly too much towards the sweet side, but very enjoyable. One more knock on this one was a relative lack of complexity. Mostly straightforward sweet, but I do like this in a beer so I found it very enjoyable. The alcohol at 10% is some of the most well hidden Ive come across. Mouthfeel is very creamy, coats my mouth and near perfect carbonation.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"

Each sip incites an ambrosial feast; I gorge myself on pineapple and creme brulee, gingerbread and honey... and flavors practically dripping with exotic perfumes of jasmine and incense. The libation concludes on a bawdier, sweet-throaty chuckle of cola, cognac and lime that impulsively French kisses into a giddy green raisin and macadamia aftertaste.

The body was pretty full, with good carbonation, but the protein chunks added a slight chewiness that became a bit much at the end.

The aroma of this beer is incredibly rich. It is of cinnamon, figs, brown sugar, and rum cake. The taste is no letdown. Raisins and figs combine with ripe cherries upfront. Nutmeg and cinnamon, and banana bread with nuts in it round out the flavors. Soak all of this in dark rum, and you start to get an idea as to what this tastes like. The alcohol is slightly noticeable.

If it werent for the two inches of yeast at the bottom of the 750, this would be a nearly perfect beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Davinci"

2321,"2008-02-24",3.3,"I really thought the bartendress brought me the wrong beer when I took a whiff and then a sip of this beer.  It is not like a Triple in any way, but I guess its ""imperial,"" so you can do what you want with it.  This beer is cerealy and sweet, which is a flavor I tend to avoid/dislike, but in this case it is carried off reasonably well.  Still, mixed feelings on this one and I wouldnt call it a favorite of mine.

It poured a muddy brown with a medium head.  Aroma is very malted-milk-ball-like, with a lot of grainy sweet cereal smell to it backed with some fruitiness.  Taste was similar, with some additional complexity in the malt flavor becoming clear after a few sips and after it warmed a bit.  There was no spice flavor that I usually associate with triples, and the fruitiness that was present was pretty minimal and confined to the finish of this beer.  The beer in no way tasted alcohol-y, particularly for a beer with 10% ABV.  Mouthfeel was smooth and good.

Im a bit conflicted; this beer was not true to style (as I understand the style), exhibited a flavor that I usually dislike, but managed to pull it off in a way I thought was kind of pleasant.  So I will recommend this beer.

2321,"2007-10-22",3.8,"Luminous, volcanic red pour, the first being fully transparent and the second fully obscure, with a lovely head of very light beige that stays the course.  Aroma suggests apples, cinnamon, pine, and walnuts; tropical fruits fill in the back while heat settles in with a spiced rum and red pepper punch, becoming estery with banana notes and steamed vegetal tones upon the second and third pours.  Crisp, full and rich flavor of spruce, bitter chocolate, tangy table wine.  Thoroughly dark and fruity; intimations of raisin, plum, and cranberry, chocolate covered for the most part.  Lightly tart, but more vinous.    Yeast weighs in with wet, bready strength, tinted with caraway and pear.  Finishing flavor is of peat and candy sugar, very dark.  Palate is full and thick, though sprightly in that uniquely belgian sense.  Blossoms with warmth and dirty honey sweetness in an extended pulse, with a pine note that nearly overpowers.  Lacking surprises, certainly, but to no dissapointing effect.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

After wrestling to pour the geyser I am left with a beautiful ruby brown ale with a small but fluffy light tan head. Strong and semi-sweet aroma of apricot, flat cola, and an earthy/musty undertone. Kind of weird, but interesting and pleasant. Flavor is almost syrupy sweet, and kind of what I expected from the aroma, but not necessarily what I really wanted to get. The fruity notes are pleasant although a bit too sweet for my taste, but I also taste a good bit of that flat cola I got in the aroma. Its not all that bad, but doesnt balance out the sweet fruity flavors that are so prevalent. There is a really nice undertone of cinnamon though. The palate is medium/full, semi-sweet, with a long finish, and some slightly sharp carbonation.

Best before 2007

Triple Imperiale poured into a snifter as the chunkiest beer I have ever seen. Poured a dark murky amber with big chunky yeasties even after a careful pour. A 2 finger dense creamy beige head formed and had some staying power but eventually fell to half finger. The head formed solid drink lines after each sip. There was no stopping the yeast chunks. They started plopping out a quarter of the way through the pour. Some as big as dimes. The yeast broke up in the glass and suspended throughout. Looks good but the chunks take away from the appearence slightly.

The smell is big with aromas of candy sugar and a number of fruits. Mainly pear, cherries, and muscat grapes. Theres hints of doughy and caramel maltiness. All the smells meld together seamlessly to create a mouthwatering aroma. Complex and very enjoyable.

The flavor is much the same with hints of all the aromas. Its difficult to pick apart because all the transitions are absolutely flawless. A light caramel maltiness lays the foundation for the wave of fruits that soon follow. Again, as in the aroma pear, sweet cherries and muscat grapes flow through with a sweetness from the candy sugar. Super smooth and complex. Absolutely zero sign of alcohol in the flavor.

The mouthfeel is as good as it gets. For a 10% abv beer the body is on the lighter side of medium which is, to me, unbelievable. The carbonation is lively and awakens every tastebud it comes into contact with and turns the beer into a wonderful creamy frothiness.

Drinkability is outstanding. Theres is no sign of alcohol in any aspect of this beer. This could easily get you in trouble.

This is an outstanding beer. A new favorite of mine. Its so well made and so easy to drink. So far on my beer travels this is the best Belgian to date and it will be tough to find something I enjoy more. But I will keep searching.

2321,"2007-05-13",3.8,"750 ml bottle: Drank on April 28th, 2007. Purchased @ Southbay Liquor. 
The abbaye ale pours a medium brown color that is near opaque through the Trappist glass.  Sweet olfaction of sugar cane and light yeast is detected in the nose.  The palate is very finely carbonated and gives the mouth feel a more relaxed drink. Flavor is a sweet and sugary taste of brown sugar or white powdered sugar. Aftertaste is sticky and leave a sweet residue around the lips like a swisher sweet cigar.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

2321,"2007-05-06",3.9,"330ml bottle, big gusher!, once the fireworks died down I was surprised I still had enough to fill my trappist glass; pours a cloudy dark brown with ruby highlights, thin tan head, good lacing.  Strong, sweet aroma of plums, raisins, molasses, and candied fruits.  Very tasty, with sweetness but not overboard; dates, raisins, and dried fruits, some yeastiness.  Palate is medium with some stickiness, and a lighter carbonation than expected, especially after the gusher.  The sweetness is light, but if youre sensitive to it, this may become a bit overbearing as it did to me.  Overall a nice belgian strong, and another solid one from Abbaye des Rocs.","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"

2321,"2007-04-19",3.9,"330ml bottle with a best before end of 2008.

Pours a very hazy red tinged brown with a dense two finger head. The foam takes nearly ten minutes to fade to a thick cap, leaving behind a solid sheet behind on the glass.

Smell; melons, dates and plums show off a nice fruitiness, that fits very well with some brown sugar, caramel, and bready malts. Theres also a bit of a earthy/charred aroma as well as some spicy alcohol in the nose.

Taste; very fruity upfront, with the dates and plums being dominant, but the melons and some cloves are present as well. Caramel, brown sugar toffee are all there, but for me, they come off as overly sweet. On the plus side, the alcohol is nearly impossible to detect in the flavor at all.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a very smooth natural carbonation, and despite the sweetness, the drinkability is pretty darn good. Im glad that this is only a 33ml bottle, as I dont think i could drink a large bottle of this due to the sweetness.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

The head was big with a helping of tiny bubbles that would burst out with flavor.  I smelled malt, dried fruit.  The taste was very sweet with fruit, malt and carmel dominating.  Very enjoyable beer by des Rocs, not as good as the Brune, but very good indeed.","New Jersey, USA","RiverHorse"
2321,"2007-04-07",2.8,"Pours a nice dark brown with a reddish hue. A nice quarter inch of head thats still there as Im drinking it. When held to the light you can see a red hue throughout. Oh my, there are some chunks in this! This beer reminds me of a tv screen while playing asteroids!
Smell is a very fruity, high in alcohol beer. There is a subtle yeasty smell. But the raisiny fruit flavor really comes through. Reminds me more of a wine smell.
I dont know if I picked up an older bottle, but the mouthfeel and taste is more subdued than I expected. Hardly no carbonation at all, matter of fact, its taking on a old english ale taste. Reminds me of a JW Lees Harvest Ale. Not the sharp, carbonated belgian I was expecting. Interesting.

2321,"2007-03-28",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 13, 2007 Date on bottle is worn of, BB 200?.  Pours a beautiful dark burgandy color with minimal clarity.  Head is very full and fluffy at first, then settles to a mostly full, canvas-colored, fluffy/creamy bit; excellent longevity and lacing is minmal, despite the wonderful head (might be the glass).  Excellent, inticing nose with lots of fruits coming into play; plum, prune, apricot, even some crab apple over the top of a nice yeasty, lighly banana, and sugary base.  Some cinnamon and clove find their way as well.  Flavor starts like the nose suggested but turns away from the prominant notes; flavors seem a little obscure compared to the nose.  Plum is still the most dominant with some apricot, banana, and light sugar and cinnamon.  The flavor progresses to a sour flash (maybe sour apple), some caramelly notes, and lends itself to some earthy bitterness and some darker malts almost filtering out the fruity flavors from the beginning flavors.  Palate is lively, but does have a creamy, soft feel and a viscous, moderately-full body.  Finish is earthy with some almost molasses-like flavor and a moderately long finish for a Strong Belgian.  Certainly a very good beer from Rocs with the initial portion (appearance, nose, first half of the flavor) being nothing short of outstanding.  The second half of the flavor and the palate are not the same, but stil good enough for a wonderful beer.

2321,"2006-10-27",4.5,"750 mL bottle w/ Best By 2006 stamped on label...
Appears a murky, dark chestnut toned brown with a huge, pillowy, light tan head that slowly fades out and leaves lots of lacing around the glass. The only down side to the appearance of this brew is the over abundance of the yeast & protein floaties that are moving up and down in the glass and sticking along the sides and the pillowy, rocky cap. Unsightly stuff to look at IMO and Ive seen some nasty stuff during my time homebrewing.
Smell is outstanding. Plenty of rich, nutty, cocoa, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, light cinnamon, vanilla, ripe plums, figs, and raisins. Jeez...I could smell this stuff all night.
Taste is just as addictive as the aromas. An array of caramelized, sweet flavors explode along the palate, yet the light, citrusy hop profile buried in the background prevents it from coming close to cloying. There is a little spice evident in the flavor as well. Its like a cinnamon, clove, and coriander mix.
Mouthfeel is sweet, borderline syrupy richness, medium bodied, smooth, boozy, slick, and semi-dry. Again, those darn proteins and yeasty floaties are ruining the brew for me. I actually took it and ran it through a tea strainer and it was much better minus the head.
Overall, this one holds its own against any of the big boys from Belgium(minus the abundance of floaties).","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"

2321,"2006-10-22",4.2,"Although this is listed as a BSA, I think it is closer to its name (Imperial Triple). Hazy amber with beautiful, lasting off-white head.  Good carbonation.  Nose catches initial wiff of dark fruits and sweet malts (very evident in the Brune and Grand Cru) but also has an added flavor of spices and a bit of tartnes like you taste in a good tripel.

2321,"2006-10-17",3.9,"Beautifully filled goblet brings us a safire-hazelnut hue underneath a dense, stiff and one inch tall, thick and milky tan head.  Some bubbles morph at the surface.  Prunes, plums and dark fruited figs fill the nose with benevolent depth. A touch of freesia and cotton compliment the brandied dates and cello-strummed currant jam resting aromatically upon crispy spiced scones.  A touch of cinder gives a brief aromatic interlude.  Sweet flavored treat indeed, harkening on plum butter, cinnamon, nutmeg and caramelized raisin bread.  Deceptively light, dropping gravity points with a refreshing spiced standpoint while the caramelized beets take care of the dark sugared depth.  Mulled raisins weave in and out of subtle black currant.  Concord and toasted graham crust fill in the rest.  Anise creeps into the sweet syrupy cloister while a plum crème brulee personifies the broiled dark hearted nature within.  Figgy pudding imbeds an underling and undying flavor accord.  Broiled pistachios dipped in plum butter give a commendable syrupy sweetness in the finish while some dates absolve the distance between candi and nuts for a satisfying outtake.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Flavors are fuller than your usual Tripel with banana, stone fruit, spice, honey, vanilla, and heavy cream. This is truely awsome. Well balanced, no alcohol detection though its 10%, wow!

2321,"2006-06-08",4.6,"envision for a moment the continuum of beer styles as a stellar sphere:  the core being the hyper-compacted essence of the brewing sciences-- the very guts of high gravity malts and the hungry origins of colonial newborn yeasts.  stretch then outward through the umber browns and oranges to the yellow and bland lighter products-- radiating in ever thinner filaments-- going forever into space and extending eventually out to the cold and barely discernible deep space dust known as budweiser. in that continuum,  this product from des rocs dwells certainly somewhere within the hottest, most radiant nuclear firmament.  its alive with yeast, hyperactive with foam, and as studded with particulate matter as a frozen margarita, but oh, so much tastier.  part sweet wine and part chocolate, the beer is chunky enough to choke a boa with its puree´ of puttied yeast floating insouciantly in the mustard-leather toned liquid.  the foam is like a marvel of zymurological steroids, foaming and over flowing the bottle even after id decanted half the contents.  inside the bottle orbs of co-mingled foam and yeast were like nebulas of crinkled cellophane-- and in the glass a chipmunk tan head was as tall and firm as wyomings devils tower. there was an aroma of rhubarb, root beer, mars bar, pencil wood and orange marmalade.  the flavor has enough grit and grain to sustain a plow horse-- its got the candy malt that male clydesdales give to their honeys.  its mississippi river-bottom soil drenched with apple butter, bourbon, and anjou pear--  it is as sweet as sauterne wine-- sweeter than bread pudding, and has both the attics and cellars of cobwebby uncooked dough. the alcohol is there in a circumspect profile but influential position, it gives heft in the absence of heavy bitterness. this doesnt match the golden-grained profile of usual triple, its a quadruple-- possibly a pentuple-- and so near the origins of the universe, you can be sure the creator gave it special attention.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"

2321,"2006-06-06",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 25, 2006 Poured a rather dark color for a ""triple"" that I was expecting: amber-red to brownish, much like a dubbel. Head wasnt over done, but kept a half centimeter thickness the entire time. Sedimentation was severe, and it didnt settle in the glass (well suspended). The aroma was of dark fruits, sweet/malty, and spiced. The flavor was more roasted for a ""triple"" (must not be one) than others, some caramel flavors, definite alcohol presence, with spices and dark fruits (plums?) present in the base. Mouthfeel was a little acidic. The finish was bitter enough from some hopping, probably the most ""triple"" thing about the beer. Re-rate, 6/25/06: Definite darker appearance than a standard triple, but this time really really fizzy, carbonated, and as soon as the cap was popped, bottle overflow all over everywhere before I tilted it into my goblet. Pour was easier to deal with, same head experience as before (persistent and a half centimeter at all times, not hard to get into the glass). Body was hard to see through, not nearly as much sedimentation as last time. The aroma was very similar to my earlier description, more yeast perhaps and caramel. Flavor again was comparable, strong caramel. Mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy with carbonation tickling the tongue. A nice bitter finish to the whole experience. This one packs a strong punch. Up a few ticks, due to the nice mouthfeel.","","User37895"

Some lighter citrusy tangerine zest and herbal incense found only in a head shop.  Medium bodied mouthfeel with a silky smooth texture.  Flavors of smokey oak ash and bitter belgian chocolate, spiced with some freshly ground white pepper.  At first, I couldnt help but think this tasted a bit like clove cigarettes, but my impression slowly improved over time as I got used to the bitter, ashy spiciness.

Bottle produces the same, pulpy snowglobe of yeasts as in other beers from this brewer, which may indicate they have a problem worth investigating. Ive had many unfiltered beers that have not looked this godawful. Brasserie de lAbbaye des Rocs should suggest to serve their beers only in lidded steins. Otherwise, we find a reddish-mahogany body with a large khaki head that fades rather quickly to a thick film and halo. Aroma rings of a barleywine with thick, sweet malts alongside orangy citrus. Complex flavor profile with cherry, anise, lemon, cookie dough, Chloraseptic, stale caramel, etc. Mid-bodied with mild astringence finishing dry, but chunky yeasty bits put me off. A nice dessert beer filled with surprises.

2321,"2006-05-02",1.7,"A serious dissapointment. I had a 750 of this stuff and was really looking forward to it.

First aroma: Alcohol. Second aroma: Alcohol. First taste: Alcohol. Tasted like a nice imperial stout with a dash of Everclear in it. I didnt feel the 10% ABV either, which was ironic. 

Lots of floaties in the bottle. I tried really hard to keep them in the bottle, but they were not flocculating out like yeast, so I dont know (or want to know) what they were. 

It was a job to finish the bottle. Perhaps it would have been better in another 6-12 months. 

Based on the 99% rating, I might try it again but this bottle was not worth the try.","Minneola, Florida, USA","cchubb"

This is probably one of the most lively beers Ive encountered...I hate to think of how it would have gushed had it not been in my fridge for a day.  Even after pouring two glasses out of a 750ml...the foam climbed its way out of the bottle.  Aroma is malt, sweet syrup, spice, and vanilla.  Taste is chocolate, vanilla, and spice...not too different from their xmas beer...except much more heavy on the malt and light on the spice.  Mouthfeel was exceptionally creamy...delicious.  I need to get myself some more of this stuff.","","CMUBEERMAN"

2321,"2006-04-16",4.2,"Bottle/best before end of 2006. Pours a deep amber-burgundy color with a tight, dense and long-lasting beige head. Fairly mild, but complex aromas of raisn, fig, honey, pumpernickel bread, ripe apple and caramel are noted. Amazingly silky smooth, creamy palate for a Belgian due to the chewy, full body and the subdued carbonation. Initial flavors are sweet and rich reminiscent of ripe dark fruits, dark rum, caramel and buckwheat honey followed quickly by the presence of some moderate spicy notes of rye seeds, licorice, coriander and black pepper. Tons of floaties in the chalice, especially at the end of the bottle; quite ""sludge-like"" appearance.

Coriander licorice sweet n spicy sauce arome is powerful.  It has a very nice touch, a delicate balance.  An excellent woody licorice pinish.  Thats preceded by a bittersweet licorice bark coriander seed with medium body.  Not overpoweringly hot, though detectably strong.  Unlike many belgian strongs they clearly didnt just dump in maximum amounts of special ingredients, the combination here is artful.  Its full of dark fruits and humidor wood, fruity like a sangria, reminiscent of one of my favorites, the trois pistoles.  This is certainly a beer I must become better friends with.","Paleolithic, Pennsylvania, USA","xproudfoot"

Subdued aroma notes sweet fruits and figgy sweetness, but also quite a bit of yeast funkiness.  Earthy and almost meaty at times.  Full bodied, with lots of dark, overripe fruits.  The carbonation is a bit flat, which kind of muddles the complexity.  Pretty solid.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

Pour is a very dark amber with white head that diminishes fairly quickly with a layer remaining for lacing.  Aroma is of clean earthiness, bread and toffee - there is also dark fruits in the background.  Lots of sediment is in the bottle as well.  Taste is very smooth, roasted malt flavor with lots of spice, carbonation, earthy Belgium yeast qualities, pepper, slight bit of chocolate, I could go on, but in a word complex - a lot is going on here, but very drinkable.  Finish has a little bit of tartness, but even more a dark buttery and dark fruit qualities.  The more beers I have from this brewery the more I realize how exceptional they are.

Appears a hazy orange-brown, with a thick creamy tan head that minimizes quickly but lasts.  Flavor is sweet citrus and spiced fruitcake over a bready malty backbone.  Palate is thick and creamy.  Overall, this beer has the experience of drinking a liquid fruitcake or bread pudding, and so it has the flavor of a perfect Christmas brew; and, it is equal to the sum of its parts.","Thousand Oaks, California, USA","dhlesq"

2321,"2006-03-25",4.3,"I stated a few months ago that I wanted to get a better impression of lAbbaye des Rocs after tasting their two showpiece beers. The result has, so far, been astounding and indeed completely obliterated my expectations. Some of these are, in my opinion terribly underrated and seem far more worthy of the Top 50 than the Brune and Grand Cru, which, mind you, are still exceptional products. Triple Impériale begins at the explosive pop of the cork as a cascade of puffy custard foam fills the glass and reduces to a creamy layer above the deep cloudy mahogany body. A wonderful hue that seems to oscillate between Bordeaux and nearly purple highlights. The thick aroma of fresh bread is immediately apparent. Progressively spices and malts build the complex character of the nose. Orange, ginger, cardamom, cinnamon, black pepper and apple scented soap, interact with the rich but soft sweetness of caramel, butter, white and milk chocolate, cappuccino and steamed white rice. As the liquid warms, the sweetness is further expressed by an eruption of strawberries and cherries. Again the yeasty qualities are first noticeable in the flavor but as you let the tongue explore each sip, the unctuous qualities begin to shine. A very subtle combination of chocolate and coffee create the basic savor which is complemented by butter, red wine, cookie dough and a sweet creaminess. The soft carbonation gives a mellow and velvety texture to the liquid that soothes the tongue as it slips suavely down the throat. The finish begins with a yeasty contour slowly dissolving to reveal a soft cappuccino and chocolate aftertaste that coats the mouth forever. A remarkable effort that simply leaves me in great anticipation of my next Abbaye des Rocs!","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

2321,"2006-03-07",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 1, 2013 Fresh Bottle March 7th 2006. Pours a dark tan with a reasonable head with strong lacing; from some bottles, a huge amount of gelatinous floating matter drifts in my chalice like a school of jellyfish, prevelant to the point that I prefer not to look too closely. The vast aroma is dominated by sweet muscat grapes, with a bit of grapefruit rind and hints of cloves, plenty of brown sugar. 
The flavor is a sweet, rich creme brule, followed by a spectrum of tangerine and citrus, leading into the yeasts and ultimately revealing its hops which add spice to the sweetness but never cut it entirely. 
The mouthfeel is simultaneously prickly (from the high level of fine-bubbled carbonation) and voluptuous (from the way that the thick oily liquid melts into a frothy rich foam on the tongue).

This is a very nice beer in the sweet strong Belgian vein; its overall character is ialso elusive for me, not so much in its overall complexity as in my inability to grasp  any single sip the totality of what it has to offer. 8/3/8/4/16=3.9

Two year old bottle Feb 12 08. A bit of a gusher as with other aged des Rocs 11.2 oz bottles, but not out of control like some. The usual jellyfish swarm floating in my glass.  Most of the muscat and grapefruit is gone now; the carbonation is actually subdued, and Im left a beer that is very sweet in a candy-sugar sort of way, rather thin for the ABV, and flavored mostly by the spicy house yeast. Its not overwhelming in this condition at all and I can only conjecture that doesnt age particularly well. Thats an understatement: two years has eviscerated this beer. Im looking at something like a 7/3/7/3/14=3.4 --- and thats being generous with a 4 for appearance.

Five year old bottle This is pretty good, actually, if one is in the mood for a sweet dark tripel. Brown sugar and kumquat peel, muscat and and creme brule. A curious and somewhat unpleasant bitterness late. Huge floaty masses clumped together more than ever; I filtered this through a gold filter (with considerably loss of carbonation, unfortunately) because the pill-sized lumps were just too much. 9/2/8/2/16 
Draft Jan 24, 2007. Brouwers in Seattle). Lovely smooth and sweet dark tripel, dominated by brown sugar and caramel, intriguing under-flavors of vanilla and tropical fruit; adequately spicy finish never turns dry but closes out the sweet flavor profile nicely.  8/4/9/4/17=4.2
Summary. After several experiences with this beer from 11.2 oz bottles and several with it on tap, Im getting a pretty significant divergence between the quality of the two. I really prefer this one on tap; my rating reflects the average of the two.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Rosted chestnut mahogany. Pale white head. Hazy and red. IT looks fabulous. Chicken bullion in the nose. This beer has that strange malty, salty thing going for it. This slides into a nuttiness that is quite chestnutty. Underneath it all is a mssive fruity yeast that is exquisite. Flavors pouind the palate. A sledgehammer o complexity and sweetness. Cane sugar sweetness at first. Saltiness looms silently in the background and then screams in the back of your mouth.

This beer had a lot of richness, with honey-soaked fruits of all descriptions dancing in and out of contact with my taste buds.  There was also a heavy tobacco note entwined with caramel and wrapped around the main fruity theme.

2321,"2006-01-06",4.5,"From a bottle into a snifter. Pours a clear, medium amber with a small, creamy, white mostly diminishing head. The aroma is really pretty: Moderately malty of fully-roasted grain, lightly hoppy with a note of pine/resin and a moderate yeasty note of cellar and full of compelling miscellaneous aromas of rosehips, clove, corriander and -- maybe Im crazy -- there seems to be a note of aspen bark/sap lightly present as well. The flavor starts heavily sweet and lightly bitter and goes into an average-length finish that is both lightly bitter and lightly sweet. The palate is pure meow. The body is full-to-medium, the texture is cream and the carbonation is fizzy. The high-alcohol content is nearly imperceptable. Danger. :) The last signal-flare of carbonation and creamy texture matches well with the mellow, balanced finish and just sends me. B-e-a-utiful!","Boulder, Colorado, USA","luckygirl"

The flavor is quite woody, but it doesnt get unpleasantly tannic because of the balance with the caramelly, raisiny malt. There are also some unsweet fruit tones, something like, erm, pomegranate maybe. The finish is dry with just a whiff of hops. The alcohol warmth is there, but not overwhelming.

Poured into Trappist glass. Thick white-chocolate head sits atop cloudy ruby/mahogany body. Fair carbonation. Cloudier toward middle, thick enough to block light.

2321,"2005-09-28",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 29, 2005 Best by 2008, Sampled September 2005
This beer is incredibly well carbonated, which produces a pale tan colored head that is two fingers thick and a layered lacing as I drink from my glass.  The beer is a hazy amber color that shows ruby highlights when held up to the light.  The aroma is rich and malty, and I mean rich and malty.  Notes of concentrated caramel, rich toffee, a backdrop of fruits like cherry and fig.  What an olfactory experience, definitely take a minute to enjoy the aromatic notes coming off this beer.

The beer is quite dry up front, almost surprisingly so, but it quickly moves to a full sweet flavor that dominates the beer through to the finish. There is a nutty, almond note here, think of Amaretto, that really comes out with the sweetness. I also get hints of cherry, vanilla, toffee, caramel, clove.  The finish has a light astringency to it that is quickly followed by a light bitterness that makes a faint attempt at balancing the sweetness. This beer is definitely quite rich, and actually has quite a similar flavor profile to the other beers I have had from this brewery.  It is perhaps a bit too sweet though, which seems to drown out what might otherwise be a pretty complex beer.  Though it is certainly is drinkable, almost as an after dinner desert.

The finish is long and lingering, full of caramel flavors, while the alcohol makes its presence known throughout the flavor profile, but in a very subtle and elegant way.  I like this beer, a lot.  These Belgian beers just do it for me.  I cant help it.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"

The aroma is really BIG with lots of really dark, dried fruit, especially fig and raisins, some alcohol, some yeast, and a bit of earth.  It is amazine to me how complex beer can be at times, and this is one of those times.  This beer has layers and layers of flavors.  Initially the taste is sweet of the malt with a little roastiness.  There are lots of candied dark fruit flavors.  As the flavors progress there is an earthy, yeastiness.  As the flavors calm and expand becoming more subtle they seem more refined.  There is a bit of dry, peppery flavor in the finish.  I really should have shared this but the DFW crew is not getting together often enough right now.

It poured a very large sized head of fine to large sized mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a yeasty transparent dark brown colored body and a thick clingy lacing.  The wonderful aroma was malty with mild vinous notes caramel grass and yeast.  The mouth feel was perfect with a tingly smooth start and a even smoother mellow finish.  The aftertaste left nice caramel malt and dark malt notes to coax the hand to raise once again and pour more.  The flavor was awesome with good dark malty notes and a nice caramel punch to it.

Aroma comes across pretty thick with big fruits and light spices. Lush and booming, yet soft and delicate as bread. Spicy dates and figs coated in oily earthy seeds of black licorice, poppy, pepper, ginger, and corriander. Small inticingly little tid bits of orange and raisin oil along with some touches of tobacco bring more complexities as it sits. 

Flavors are big too; thick, lush, full body, favorable breadyness about its weight. Dark fruits decorate most of the tastes with rich and oily dates, figs, and raisins. Some dark orange touches the finishing qualities. Nicely handled and mild toned spices decorate the areas where the fruits leave off. So very well placed and a perfect compliment to the fruits. Cracked pepper, black licorice, ginger root, smokey vanilla, and tobacco are all put lightly in there place as not to distract from the fruit cake thickness.

Big full body, lush, rich, tender, fruity and spicy, oily in some respects closer to the leftover finishing characteristics. Very actively full from start to finish. Boisterously so. A truly enjoyable sipper. Take your time with this one, its worth it. Extravagantly fantastic stuff!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Theres a lot of large sediment floating around.  It would be a 5 in appearance, but the large ""chunked"" sediment doesnt look all that appealing (even though I dont mind drinking it).  The flavor starts with a moderate yeast and pineapple combination.  It finishes with some light raisin, peach, and a touch of citrus tanginess.

2321,"2005-04-08",4.3,"Dark amber color and a deep tan head that dissipates to a film layer with plenty of lacing. Aroma is quite fruity with strong elements of pear and sweet apple, but these elements do not subdue the malt itself as with some Belgians. Flavor is very hearty, with a meaty element present in the strong maltiness. There also seem to be more hops present than in the typical tripel. Besides the basic fruity esters naturally present and a strong element of caramel, I have trouble detecting complex nuances in the flavor of this beer -- its still great though. Alcohol is extremely well hidden and hits in the back of the throat where it should. Found a slight disappointment with the mouthfeel of this beer in that it seems runny and with not quite enough carbonation for a Belgian (not to say that there arent plenty of bubbles), also a slightly syrupy finish, but I only will deduct 1 point instead of 2 because these problems seem to be largely ""a price to pay"" for the alcohol % of a tripel in general. All in all, this is a highly recommended Trappist beer. And remember, if someone finishes the big bottle and wants to rate some more beers tonight, youve just drunk almost the equivalent of a bottle of wine so you might in all fairness want to hold off on the next ratings until tomorrow!

Undertones of sublime spice and light fruit veins throughout the tasting. Get a hint of brine and peat moss on the finish. The feel is sticky, smooth, and lush.

2321,"2005-03-29",4.0,"3/7/05.  Poured out of 750 mL bottle, bought at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA 3/2/05.  Deep brown-red with orange shading.  Dense, fluffy head.  Great, slow and sticky lacing on a medium-tan head.  Aroma has fruits galore and spices all over with that beautiful house yeast.  Reminds me greatly of the other des Rocs beers (with I love), but also has a strange vegetal scent, somewhat like Traquair Jacobite.  Taste is slowly blossoming; oily texture with teasing sweeetness and fluffy carbonation, a shade of alcohol burn in the back.  Finishes with a soft plant-like sweetness, a medley of fruits, and a dark, fluffy residue, somewhat drying.  Great balance between sweet and dry.  Very fruity and dry finish.  Really well made, but some of the flavors (promised exactly in the nose) dont quite agree with me.  Finish is long and delicate-- almost no alcohol presence-- but again does not quite go where I want it to.  No terribly surprising deviations from the rest of the beer.  Very tidy and good, and I cant even seem to find much aesthetic fault-- the only ""problem"" is that it doesnt surprise or excite me in any great way.  Very, very good beer.

Aroma of strong yeast, dark fruits, dark candi sugar and rum-soaked raisins.  Flavor begins with a fruity sweetness, with more residual candi-like sugar on the way.

2321,"2005-01-17",3.9,"I liked the dark golden color of this Belgian Strong and the little yeast floaties in the beer.

2321,"2005-01-17",4.2,"The cap was crusted on, the cork is soaked and their was zero pop when I opened the beer, is this a bad sign? Answer absolutely not! There is a ton of carbonation on the pour that forms a dense tan head. Whoa the body looks like a beer in the middle of a primary fermentation. Huge chunks journeying round and round in dark brown/ruby liquid. Geez, you would think that I had shaken the bottle to death. The aroma is pleasing, sweet malt, raisins, pineapple, and hints of mint. The flavor is big. Sweet caramel and raisin malts hit you first then a dose of earthiness and finally herbal hoppy bitterness and light alcohol.  Body is medium-full and creamy. It leaves a thick coating in your mouth. Lingering yeastiness. Quite the brew from quite the brewer. A real good match for the weather outside, 14 degrees F and dropping.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"

The liquid beneath lay a darkish red/brown and harbored a family of nasty yeast floaters...the aroma was sweet with spice, yeast, and dried fruit.

Intriguing flavor, incredibly rich toffee mixed with raisin and molasses, thick and syrupy.  Some oak and vanilla, nice depth, candy sugar sweet at the swallow.  Yeasty and vinous as well.

Medium-light  body, bubbly, lush, expansive in mouth with flavors of  caramel, vanilla, fruity esters, yeast and oddly,quite herbal. Almost a hint of mint and oregano. It actually plays nice with the sweetness. Finishes sweet, slighty herbal and a touch of alcohol and a kiss of hops.. Great, unique brew. Merry Xmas to me:)","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"

Full-bodied and creamy with medium-carbonation.  Lengthy, sweet, caramel finish. A maltheads dream. Malty and sweet, but not cloyingly so. Its like drinking liquid caramel.

I collect beer labels so I have the label from this bottle which MATCHES THE PICTURE OF THE BOTTLE SHOWN ON THIS SITE FOR ANYONE DOUBTING WHETHER I HAVE OR HAVE NOT RATED THIS BEER. This beer poured a huge ivory head on first pour and a frothy head on the 2nd pour. Carbonated, yeasty on the 2nd pour, hazy, and an orange brown hue. Malty, caramel, sweet, spicy, and alcohol aroma. Wonderful!  But wait! The flavor is one to behold! Oh my gosh! Sweet, malty, caramel, and spicy. Makes me think Ive died and gone to heaven!  Absolutely wonder! More please! Tingly mouthfeel.

2321,"2004-11-25",4.0,"New beer in town! 
I shared a 750 with the dude at the Brew Shack. 
 Poured a murky amber body with edges of gold. The head on this beer is sensational; its a massive light tan  eggshell hue with amazing lace that fully drapes the glass! The aroma and flavor are massively fruity but with a nice little suggestion of that lovely county barnyard likeness that I tend to enjoy sooo very much!  . Insanely large malty notes of plums, apple, dates, figs, and brown sugar engulf ones senses. There is that sweet and smoky note of molasses there in the back end, along with a toasty bready-ness.  The bottom ¼ of the bottle has freaking excessively large chunks of yeast and sediment This beer takes Triples to an entirely NEW level!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
2321,"2004-11-21",3.7,"It appears this beer has slipped under the radar a bit.  Hazy red body with abundant suspended rather nefarious-looking floaties (something Ive come to expect from this brewer), medium-thick tan head.  Heres another brewer with a distinctive house yeast character, this time becoming apparent immediately in the aroma with its strong perfumey (yarrow?), petaly character.  Also a bit caramely and leathery.  The flavor is quite sweet, with dark candi sugar, strong herbal and perfumey yeast flavors, a touch of pepper and a spoonful of plum.  Finishes with a rather dirty bitterness.  Not all that different from the original Abbaye (now Brasserie) des Rocs.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
2321,"2004-11-19",3.9,"Very dark, slightly cloudy brown. A huge tan head tops this one. Aroma is pears and nutmeg. It also has bread. Less fruit aromas than some Tripels. The flavor is a solid pear with some cinnamon spice in the aftertaste. It also has a nice slightly funky barnyard flavor. There are both sour and some sweet things going on here. Hard to pinpoint flavors. Overall, an enjoyable experience.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
2321,"2004-11-16",4.5,"Light brown color with lots of chunks - NICE!. Tall, rich and thick light tan head: somewhat rocky - that settles to a finger of dense foam. Fruit (raisins, pears, passion fruit, banana, and pineapple), minty herbs (light wintergreen, and rosemary), and light caramel in an aroma, that gets richer as it warms. This does remind me of the Grand Cru.  I may have to do a side by side.  Quite sweet throughout. More stewed fruit in the flavors. Light vanilla, and cinnamon.  Mild herbal hops take back the sweetness late in the quaff. LIght oily feel. Linger is not strong malt and herbs seem to jump around. Has a real aperitif quality.  This is one of those brews that continues to grow on me.  Now that im nearly done, I really want another, a touch scary considering I dont taste, but are starting to feel the effects of the 10% ABV. This is a brew that will find its way to my holiday table!!!","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
