I recently tried their Hazelutely Choctabulous, but hadnt tried its 40% component, so decided Id give it a shot. And, having closed the circle on this, it all makes sense now. This is dominated by bitter chocolate, with no hint of milk chocolate sweetness, making it not as one-dimensional as the 60% component Hazelnut Nectar, but definitely simple. Combining this ones bitterness and chocolate flavours with the nutty sweetness of the Hazelnut Nectar basically provide all the components for a candy bar, and makes Hazelutely Choctabulous greater than the sum of its parts. (And yes, I retained some of both components and mixed them myself. Calling it magic might be gilding the lily a tad, but its definitely worth doing, if you can lay hands on both components but not the blended bottle.) (14/20)","CANADA","UXO"

The chocolate is less sweet on the palate, its dark and bitter with additional dry and dark roasted malt to further contrast the sweetness. Also fruits in the background, together with wood, and lactic sugar and brown sugar. Moderate to light sweet taste with a moderate bitter finish.

Theres a fine rich, chocolate finish that is about as good as it gets, with a nice bit of dark roasted malt flavor, a faint hint of coffee, and a touch of spicy hops. The beer is mildly hoppy throughout at a level that is well matched to the malt and chocolate. The last statement applies to both the aroma and the flavor.

Byłoby genialne, ale skoro to wynik dodanych aromatów? Równie dobrze może pachnieć Chanel No5.
Pierwszy łyk i... zaskoczenie - piwo jest lekko kwaskowate i wytrawne. Wprost odwrotnie do zapachu. Straszliwa niespójność. Po takim aromacie spodziewałem się czegoś słodkiego, nic bardziej mylnego.

OCZY : piwo jest ciemnobrązowe ale nie jest przejrzyste i z daleka wygląda na czarne jak smoła. Piana jest średniej wielkości i jest brązowa. 

NOS : piwo ma rewelacyjne aromaty ciemnych palonych słodów i czekolady. Czekolada wychodzi na pierwszy plan, do tego sporo śmietany i wanilii, toffi... niesamowity zapach mlecznej czekolady i ciepłych lodów. Do tego delikatnie orzechy, sernik, lody bananowe, skórka pomarańczy... zapach ogólnie urzeka. 

USTA : piwo jest mało nasycone o konsystencji kakaa. 
Piwo jest faktycznie dosyć słodkie o dominujących nutach ciasta, czekolady i pianki śmietankowej. Gorycz jest subtelna na początku i staje się coraz bardziej wyraźna. Nuty podobne są w części do palonych nut kawy ale tylko w części bo reszta zasługi należy się chmielom. Chmiele są na tyle niezapomniane, że udaje im się wydobyć spod tak mocnego charakteru słodowego tego piwa. Są to nuty podobne do pestki grejpfruta i skórki pomarańczy. Posmak jest subtelny i nie zalega tak jak w tym stylu potrafią piwa. Tutaj mamy do czynienia z typowa cierpkością podobna do popielniczki i gorzkiej czekolady. 

ODCZUCIA : piwo zrobiło na mnie wrażenie. Jest to pierwsze tak bardzo autentyczne czekoladowe piwo jakie piłem. Oprócz tego jest łatwe w piciu i świetnie zbalansowane.

Pours a dark brown with a tan head that endures well over a couple of minutes and leaves great lacing everywhere. 

Dark malt sweetness on entry but not overly sweet, The bitterness will always be present. On the palate the bitterness pops out very nicely, perhaps a bit exaggerated, but it works well given the other elements present here.

When it warms up enough, the chocolate aromas shine more than the coffee ones. However the bitterness will stay on the palate for a rather long time, unless youre having a rich chocolate dessert with this, which I feel is what it was made for. An outstanding bittersweet example of this style and would probably be a great component in a cocktail.","Miami, Florida, USA","MiamiBarman"

Comments: This one is a close match against Youngs Double Chocolate Stout. Whereas Youngs tends to be creamier, this one is all chocolate - more dark than milk - both in nose and taste.

618,"2014-06-19",4.1,"Transfer from BA review from 6-6-12- 
Served in a 10 oz chalice glass

Appearance  Served a deep-deep brown color with a very small light tan head. The head faded very fast leaving almost no lacing.

Smell  A nice aroma of chocolate with some roasted malt notes mixed in are the biggest. These create a slightly semi-sweet chocolate smell when mixed with a lighter sweeter aroma of toffee and milk.

Taste  The taste is of a roasted malt with a good deal of dark chocolate up front. As the taste advances it sweetens some with the toffee flavors coming to the tongue. This toffee creates a more milk chocolate/semi-sweet chocolate bar like flavor in the middle of the taste which, as time advances further continues to strengthen. It is a very satisfying flavor that carries to the end, where some coffee flavors bitter the taste a bit and leave a very satisfying coffee infused dark chocolate flavor on the tongue.

Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the creamier side with the carbonation level being on the lower side. Both suit the flavor profile of the beer quite well and allow all the chocolaty flavors to be sensed by the tongue.

Overall A very nice chocolate stout that is very easy to drink. Rouge has done a nice job with this one and I would recommend.","","Darkmagus82"

618,"2014-06-14",3.3,"Aroma: 4/10. Smells of burnt malt and hops, very metallic aroma characteristic of those terrible hops Rogue insists on using.

Appearance: 5/5. Looks like I want my stouts to look like; opaque black with a medium-thick gray-tan head that lasts.

Taste: 6/10. Burnt malt, bitter coffee, notes of cocoa (not chocolate, just cocoa, and burnt-tasting cocoa at that.) Too much hops used (just like everything else Ive had from Rogue, sigh.) Metallic. More like a Guiness-style dry stout than the sweet treats Im used to.

Palate: 4/5. Nice mouthfeel, creamy head, smooth on the tongue. Lingering roast/burnt malt flavor and hoppy bitterness. 

Overall: 14/20. A really well-crafted beer that, unfortunately, makes that same classical Rogue breweries problem: Letting the hops run wild over everything good about the beer. If you prefer Guiness-style dry stouts to traditional sweet stouts, youll probably rate this a lot higher.

A: Pours a nice dark brown ale with a single finger of fine latte head. This dissipates over several minutes to a thick sheet of the same. cobweb lacing. Excellent clarity when one can see light.

S: Milk chocolate, cocoa, dark malts. Sweet, raisins, some hints of prune. Slightest metallic scent. A little yeast on the finish.

T: Nose>taste. Dry, dirty, slightly bitter. Some coffee grounds. The milk chocolate is left behind and only the bittersweet bakers chocolate is left in the finish. For a stout the flavors dont add up to much IMO.

M: Medium to thin with moderate carbonation. Would like to see more creaminess in the body, a bit too dry on the palate. 

O: Everything seems to go great until the taste, then things dont go so well. I think the flavor is a bit one-dimensional and fails to highlight the chocolate as adverted. The body is thin and forgetful. Not a beer of fame for me.

618,"2013-08-11",4.0,"I poured a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass. It had no freshness date. It cost $7.49 ($0.34 per ounce).

Appearance: Deep shade of black out of the bottle. Pours to a large, brown, frothy head which retains and laces very well.

Smell: Dark chocolate candy, some roasted malt.

Taste: When a beer is named ""Chocolate Stout,"" you go in with an expectation. And while Rogue Chocolate Stout is plenty chocolaty, its not all chocolate all the time. Its more of a strong stout that happens to have a bitter dark chocolate taste on the finish. Its also quite bitter with significant hop presence throughout. 

The thing about big stouts is that theyre pretty bitter from the roasted barley. Theres a taste akin to burnt toast right away here. Its dry and slightly astringent, but theres an underlying sweetness. It doesnt change much at the apex, though the second half of the swig is the best part as thats when all the chocolate is revealed. Its a bitter dark chocolate, and not particularly sweet or milky. A hint of vanilla can be detected, as well as some minor citrus flavors from the Cascade hops. At 69 IBUs, theres a reason the hops are prominent here. Theres a minor oatmeal sweetness on the aftertaste, though it fades quickly. A solid, well-balanced stout, though I cant help but want even more chocolate.

Drinkability: While Rogue Chocolate Stout is no session beer, its not imperial beast, either. Its a full-bodied beer for sure, though the mouthfeel seems a little thin for the style. Its comfortable, though, and its goes down smooth. A slightly dry residual aftertaste, but its tolerable. At 6% ABV its a relatively strong beer, though most drinkers should have no trouble handling all 22oz themselves.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

618,"2012-08-05",4.3,"A: The appearance is outstanding. The beer appears opaque and jet black, with a towering, thick beige head over an inch thick. After several minutes, the head slowly begins to dissipate, leaving ample lacing all over the tulip glass.

S: The aroma is fabulous, with dominant scents of chocolates and chocolate syrup, followed by a roasted malt character.

T: The taste does not disappoint. Chocolate syrup and melted chocolates consume the palate without ever being overly sweet. Roast and coffee flavors come in behind, creating a wonderful and delicate dance.

M: The feel is great. Smooth and creamy, with just the right carbonation level.

D: I honestly didnt think I could drink so much of this beer and still want more. I drank most of the bomber by myself, and was a bit bummed when it ran out. A superb marriage of chocolate and beer - highly recommended.

Aroma: The nose is full of rich, sweet chocolate, accompanied by a bit of roasted malt and coffee

I just recently realized how many of the major Rogue beers I havent rated to this point, and I figured that it would be as good an excuse as any to revisit some of them.

618,"2012-03-20",3.0,"This beers nose is amazing. It is a temptingly rich chocolate that is reminiscent of some of the best smelling chocolate I can think of. Sadly though, the beer itself is a bit thin and one dimensional. With its nose, one would think that it would open up to symphony of chocolate flavors that match its aroma with unreal depth, but sadly this is not the case. It is not that this is a bad beer, it just is that it is not a very remarkable beer. In its finish, it leaves very little to remember it by.","Florida, USA","pari6819"

618,"2012-03-01",3.6,"From notes.  First reviewed 1/24/2011.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

This pours nearly black, with a few tints of ruby. A nice tan creamy head maintains well and leaves interrupted webs of lace down the glass.

The aroma is very chocolately, with roasted malt as support. Soft aroma overall, except the chocolate, with even softer earthy hop notes.

Dark chocolate starts the sip and works well with the roasted malt. Some light bitterness exists at the edge of the malt flavor and there is a smokey quality there as well. Muted earthy hops help to smooth it out. The light level of hops work well with the unsweetened taste and 

Creamy, with enough carbonation to maintain the head. Slightly sticky. Medium to full body.

Solid overall, this is a pretty good chocolate stout and worth coming back to.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

The aroma is of dark chocolate syrup with a floral hop aroma. It tastes upfront like a sweet milkshake made with chocolate syrup instead of chocolate icecream.

Pitch black, pours a massive, creamy head.

Aroma
Chocolate, unsurprisingly. Malt, light toasty notes. And some more chocolate!

Taste
Well, Im going to go out on a limb here and say that I taste some chocolate Its a rather milky combination of chocolate and malt though, rather than the very dark, roasted chocolate flavour that you get with some Chocolate Stouts (I have Youngs Double Chocolate Stout in mind in particular). The beer supposedly packs a lot of hops as well, but I cant really taste them, the chocolate and malt are overwhelming. Perhaps there is a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste, but that as well is dominated by notes of roasted malt.

Overall
This is my first sampling of the Chocolate Stout, and I was expecting not to be disappointed  I wasnt! The beer is rated extremely highly, but there are some very valid competitors in this category...","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","Arborescence"

Cool milk chocolate/cocoa aroma, very intense, that overpowers some cereal, herbs components. The taste is cocoa/milk chocolate mostly; some licorice on the background. Really smooth mouthfeel, a little bit watery. medium/low carbonation. The light body doesnt support the intense aroma and taste but it isnt a big issue; the beer is a lot enjoyable anyway. sadly The finish is really short. Im really surprised about this beer but i think the total score result has been too way generous this time. To summarize:  even if i had a lot of chocolate beers (ok, i love chocolate) better than this, the Rogue CS is definitely a must try","Berlin & Rome, GERMANY","INDASTRIA"

Picked up a bomber at the store.

Pours a solid black with a thick fluffy tan head that stuck around for most of the experience. Initially the smell was all citrus hops, but as it warmed a bit I started getting some chocolate and some coffee. As I write this the chocolate is taking over, smells like hersheys special dark. There is a roast bitterness in the taste, but I think some of that bitterness comes from the chocolate as well. I once home brewed a chocolate stout with pure cacao nibs, and this has that taste that I got. Taste has some hops in it as well as that silky chocolate taste. Mouthfeel gets better as it warms, I initially thought it a bit thin. Great brew, Im glad I chose it today.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"

On the nose its all chocolate and some faint hop notes.

The flavor is dominated by chocolate which is to expected. It also has some roasted notes.  I guess it depends on what type of chocolate you like. This is very cocoa influenced. Its pretty creamy over all but very simple.

It finishes with some faints hops and a little dry but nothing that hangs around. Its hard to believe this even beer really. This is so easy drinking. I would have to say that this would be a stout to start with if you are trying the style for the first time.","Alberta, CANADA","Scubaguy"

618,"2011-01-19",3.8,"Sampled at the BrewHaHa in Grand Rapids.  A solid chocolate stout that tastes strongly of chocolate, oddly enough.  One of the highlight beers of the night.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","manny57"
618,"2011-01-14",2.8,"Poured into a pint glass.

4.0 A: Pitch black color. Two fingers of brown head, which starts out really foamy and dies down to frothy. Good retention and lots of lacing.

4.5 S: Nose is full of bittersweet chocolate. Real chocolate, not artificial. I feel like Im in Hershey, PA. Pretty one dimensional, but its a good dimension.

3.0 T: Taste is a huge letdown. The burst of chocolate in the nose is nowhere as strong as I expected or would have liked. I would liken it to drinking a Coke with ice and letting all the ice melt. The diluted coke is worse than either coke or water. Thus, this beer would be better if the chocolate were ramped up or completely removed. Suprisingly bitter and much less malty than I would have expected.

2.5 M: Light body, which is the exact opposite of what I would want in a chocolate beer. A bit overly carbonated too. Not creamy at all.

2.5 D: Based on the appearance and smell I was expecting something akin to ST Choklat. The taste and mouthfeel eliminated that thought on the first sip. This is a bad beer, which could easily be salvaged by ramping up the chocolate flavors and thickening the mouthfeel.

Very chocolatey on the nose. Sweet milk chocolate notes, some floral hop notes, and a solid roastiness. This is indeed one of the most chocolatey-smelling beers out there!

As much as the smell reminded me of sweet milk chocolate, the taste couldnt be further away from it. At first, bitter chocolate notes dominated, followed by a solid roastiness, with a touch of coffee. Some earthy hops were also present The finish was dry and fairly bitter, with just a hint of chocolate lingering on. After some time, I began noticing a little more sweetness appearing, which really boosted the drinkability for me.

Medium body to it; fairly crisply carbonated. Quite smooth; nicely coats your palate. No trace of alcohol.

Overall, this is a very drinkable stout. Definitely smoother and more drinker-friendly than a typical dry stout. The chocolate really makes a difference. If you are a fan of stout, youll probably enjoy this a lot. This could even make a session stout.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","DenisLD"

618,"2010-01-31",4.2,"Pours pure black. I see no light or color coming through. The head is almost three fingers and looks somewhat soapy. Big bubbles popping and leave a nice lacing on my Guinness tulip pint glass.

Smell is pure hersheys syrup. Good grief this smells delicious. Dive in deeper and i get some major hops hidden initially by the chocolate. Some floral notes.

This beer is pretty much chocolate hops. Lots of chocolate sweetness as one would expect but the finish is nice a bitter and hoppy. The hops balance it out nicely or the chocolate might be too out of control.

Smooth and silky. Nice mouthfeel just a bit of carbonation present. I would call this medium to heavy bodied.

Drinkability is good. Slightly heavy so i could only drink one bomber. But it is delicious and great for dessert.

Overall this is a really good beer and a really good chocolate. I really dont have any other chocolate stouts to compare it to. I would recommend this one definitely.","Pennsylvania, USA","BigMike"

The beer isnt too sweet or too chocolatey. There are good mineral and earthy hop notes. The malt backbone is big and strong.

The aroma brings characters of chocolate milk, followed by subtle roasted malt.  The palate again begins with a nice natural-tasting chocolate character, followed by some middle to high crystal roasted malt flavor.

618,"2009-11-18",3.4,"Pitch black with a surprisingly big, brown head that settles into great looking lacings.

The aromas is basically just of sweet chocolate mixed with distinct yet not overly powerful roasted malts. Some chocolate syrup, chocolate powder and a faint milky note. Not bad, but certainly not very complex.

Very distinct flavor of sweet chocolate from start to finish. The chocolate flavors arent that luxurious though, they taste more like cheep dark chocolate, milk chocolate and chocolate syrup. Some dark toffee. Just a hint of dark fruits (plums?). Plenty of roasted malts, not very powerful though and they certainly are overshadowed by the chocolate. In the finish coffee flavors make a fairly good attempt at balancing the sweet chocolate flavors and gives the beer somewhat of a mochaccino edge to it. Some very gentle chocolate bitterness and mild grassy hops in the finish as well, and of course more chocolate. Unfortunately, the finish came out a bit short and boring to me, nothing really takes the lead and the taste just fades away too quickly.

Medium body, actually thinner than I had expected. Quite a lot of carbonation. However, it seems like some time in the snifter serves this one well since it gets a little rounder and and the mouthfeel gets somewhat smoother after a while.

A good beer, but I dont think it managed to live up to my expectations. Indeed, there is a lot of sweet chocolate flavors going on here and thats the way it should be, but it would have been nice with a little more complexity and a bigger body. Still recommended, though.

Heavy dark chocolate/cocoa aroma with a sweet almost sinewy and lingering finish.

And more importantly they were able to keep the abv down to just above 6%, some of the other imperial choc stouts are a bit high in abv to really enjoy thoroughly.

The brewpub often serves it a tad on the cold side, I like to let it warm up quite a bit and it becomes more complex conjuring up clouds of anise and licorice.

Tastes like cocoa powder and water, oats, barley, and fresh hops. Leaves a bitter filmy after-taste.

It pours a very nice deep brown color. Very nice tan head. The aroma alone makes you want to jump into this brew for a swim. Let the beer rest for a minute after the pour. et the head reach about one inch of thickness untill you take your first sip. 
Just like the aroma, the first sip leaves you very happy. A clean and well balanced chocolate and coffee undertone, complements the oats and malts so well, it leaves you stareing at the glass and bottle while enjoying it.

618,"2009-10-06",4.0,"Bottle. Pours pretty much jet black with a decent sized tan head that leaves a lot of lacing. Obviously chocolate is upfront in the aroma with some roasted malt and a little caramel, but surprisingly enough there is a fairly strong presence of floral hops. The flavour also has chocolate upfront but it seems more like bitter dark chocolate than the aroma where it seems sweeter. There is also the roasted malt and a little nuttiness. Overall, with its exceptionally smooth, creamy mouthfeel and a little bitterness, this is a great chocolate stout where everything is balanced just right.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","BeerChaser0078"

Sweet malt flavors, very heavy chocolate in the malt. Roasted but not burnt or bitter. A taste more like liquid chocolate than like a stout. Warmth gives a hint of roasted bitterness.

Flavor was similarly over-sweet chocolate milk, cocoa powder, cream, hint of vanilla, but then excessively hopped which produced a strange salt water taffy flavor. Palate was actually somewhat light but produced a good amount of lacing. Not great on its own but pretty good with a cigar.","Glenside, Pennsylvania, USA","Jsawyer"

The smell of this stuff is almost pure bakers chocolate, with maybe some bitter coffee, and I think I can smell some hops witch is giving this brew a soapy aroma. On my first sip the first thing that came to mind was ""mmmmmm........Easter Bunny"" very chocolatey flavor that leaves a very bitter after taste, but then I can also taste hops, I hate hops in a stout it ruins the taste for me dont get me wrong I like beers with a ton of hops in them just not in stouts and porters. This was a O.K. beer but in my opinion it dosnt live up to its legend, maybe take out the hops and then this would be a beer I would love","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","Cirrhosis"

618,"2009-06-02",3.8,"The aroma of this beer makes me salivate. Strong warm chocolate rules in beer! This has enough of that. Fresh smelling too. The only negative is that it has a slight powdery smell and could be more complex. Other slights: alcohol, malt and the hops. Something in there makes me think of port. Youd have to say that this brew is black. Its got a good chocolate milk cap - poured pretty good, but its dropped to a thin line....one that wont go away. Ok lacing, but its spotty. Taste needs to have way more chocolate. Very bitter chocolate flavour (that bakers stuff that youd get all exited about when you were young - until you took that first big bite), maybe a slight coffee touch (maybe) and too many hops. The hops do well in this beer - soft, background, but what exists is still too bitter for me in this type of beer (barely... after another one of these Im sure Ill take that back). I like the chocolate bitter and hop bitter is good, but a soft bitter. Pretty straight forward flavour. Mouthfeel is smooth, tasty (malts and hops leave traces) and has a bitterness that is quiet. Concidering Cascade hops have been used, they have been controlled well. Good beer. Still doesnt defeat the mighty Youngs.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

618,"2009-01-23",3.7,"22oz bottle. Pours a black body with a finger-width, creamy, dark chocolate brown head that dissipates slowly and remains moderately lacy with a nice swirl on the surface. Aroma of dense, dark, chocolate truffle. Very rich chocolate cocoa. A light burnt roast as well as a light bitter backing. Taste is initially a quick sweet, smooth, rich chocolate that quickly moves to a light to moderate bitterness that lasts through the ending. Finishes slightly burnt with a light creamy chocolate touch and a carbonated feel. Palate is medium bodied and a mix between smooth and choppy. Pretty dry in the finish. Overall, the touch of burnt roast is more evident than a hop bitterness and to me is just a tad off. Could use a little more of that initial creamy rich chocolate throughout.

Smell: holy chocolate! Smells like a chocolatier’s shop with a hint of coffee.

The first taste to hit is a bit of roasted malt, but is immediately followed the the rich and creamy chocolate flavor mixed with a touch of mocha. The mix of these two principle flavors is what makes this truly spectacular. Very well-balanced.

This brew goes down very smooth and creamy. It reminds me of nice creamy Swiss/Italian chocolate. I would say it is a medium-full body...not too full, but still has a lot to it.

I could drink this one until I am stuffed. An excellent brew. This is the best stout that I have had to date without a doubt.

618,"2008-10-05",3.9,"There are certain pleasurable experiences that separately are divine. Put them together and you open yourself to a mind-blowing sensual experience. A delectable stout and chocolate is one of them. A good stout on its own will have varying levels of chocolate notes, so when you add real chocolate to the mix, it gets dangerously close to beervana.

Coming to me today on draft is the Rogue Chocolate Stout. So far, my only other chocolate stout experience has been the Young’s Double Chocolate Stout which is sinfully delicious. My Rogue came to me a dark murky black with hints of burnt earth peeking through along the sides and bottom of my glass. The nose is an immediate immersion in a warm vat of milk chocolate with a hint of cherries in the mix. Chocolate covered cherries, anyone? A dark beer does not necessarily denote a heavy or thick beer, and the Rogue Chocolate Stout is neither too thick nor too heavy. A pleasing medium body and a lightly drying palate leaves no cloying presence, but instead a refreshing and sweet experience. Rich succulent milk and dark chocolate notes mingle together in harmony as a bitter bite nibbles on the top and sides of my tongue after each quaff. Smooth and creamy sweet, she starts and finishes in an enveloping aroma and body of milk chocolate temptation with a hint of espresso.

Pours a deep brown, almost black, with very little light coming through with a big bubbly brown coca-cola-esque head that is definitely staying around. Aromas are sweet creamy chocolate with almost a hot chocolate lure. Initial is smooth, a medium bodied brew that slowly slides into chocolate creamy heaven. Finish sneaks in a touch of hoppy bitterness, stout dryness, and roasted malts. Very inviting brew that leaves a very enjoyable aftertaste and could be a wonderful gateway brew to lure people in (While still being a special, remarkable brew on its own).

618,"2008-04-07",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2008 Original rating 3/6/05.  Pours a very black color, moderate tan head that doesn’t last long. Chocolate, malty aroma, although not all that strong. The flavor is pretty nice with dark chocolate right away with subtle malts and bitter hop notes following. This seems more like a dessert. Hell, maybe it can be. I can’t drink too many of these chocolate beers though. A simple 12 ounce would have been fine. 

Re-rate 10/31/08. A nice one for Halloween. Black color with a little amber sneaking through with a thin head, even with an aggressive pour. Wonderful aroma, lots of cocoa. The beer starts off rather tame but quickly turns to a nice mix of milk and dark chocolate flavors. Roasted malts, light hop bitterness and coffee notes prevent this from being too one dimensional. Chocolate lingers long into the aftertaste. Easy drinking stout... no problem finishing a bomber this time.

This beer is balanced remarkably well, with all the flavors existing together quite harmoniously. The mouthfeel is little sharp for the style, but is still very nicely full bodied.

Taste is fairly bitter from the citrusy hops up front, but then transitions into a deep roast with a surprisingly small amount of chocolate present.

618,"2008-03-09",4.2,"Bomber poured into a pint glass.  Poured a thick black with a tan beige head that was fluffy and lasting and lead to nice lacing.  Aroma: wow!  For me, this was by far the most appealing aspect of this beer.  It wasn;t extremely complex, it was just unbelievable delicious smelling: rich chocolate, coffee, and sugar.  The chocolate worked much better with the aroma the flavor; the flavor was still good, but it tasted kind of like watered down dark chocolate, and the focus on the chocolate style kind of takes away from the other typical stout aspect that one might normally be able to pick up on.  There were small hints of oak and alcohol.  The palate was nice and rich, smooth and creamy and dark.  It leaves a warm stickiness coating the palate.   This was a great beer in my books.  
 
WARNING: I just noticed (upon getting to the bottom of the bottle) that there is a thick layer of residue/sediment settled on the bottom of my bottle.  This is probably because the bottle was sitting for a long time and i didnt remember to stir it or agitate it in the bottle before pouring it.  Be warned to agitate the bottle so as to abstract all of the beers intended flavors.  Perhaps this accounted for the ""watered"" down chocolate flavor.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

618,"2008-02-24",3.5,"Near black colored, little brown head. Well, chocolate dominates this overly sweet aroma, slight hops, mild caramel and roastiness also there. Medium bodied.

618,"2008-02-08",4.5,"Rogue Chocolate Stout
ABV: 6.3%
Volume: 1 PT 6 FL. OZ.
Glass: okocim .5L curved glass
Purchased at: Jacks Wine Sense
Consumed on: 02/08/08

first impression: Absolutely beautiful in sight and smell. A rich cocoa scent with dark undertones. Head is fabulous and three fingers. Three slow pours to fill the half liter glass. Only visible color change is at the thinnest edge, where its a deep purplish red. I could smell it all day long, but on to tasting. Its like a deep dark chocolate cocoa with strong hop overtones. A glorious mix of bitter and sweet. The tastes are hardly sweet, but so very delicious.

Visuals -- Color, depth, belgian lace, legs: The edge of the stout where color peeks through is more orange than red, and it seems angry. The taste isnt exactly happy either - its beating the hell out of my palate, but its wonderful. Head dies down after a few long sips, but still very present. The lace is nice and stays with you.

Olfactory -- Aroma: While the other aspects of this stout are delectable, the aroma is maybe its best feature. It is heavenly.

Taste -- Hoppiness, bite, maltiness, flavor: The hops are surprisingly present. If this beer was smoother or sweeter, it wouldnt be such a powerful presence. The hops are here and obvious, but not overpowering, and not the point. The point is the chocolate flavor.

Tactile -- weight, mouthfeel: Its heavy in the hand, the eye, and the wrist. Its heavy in the air and on the tongue. Its undeniable. Crispy and dry with a smoother finish.

second impression: What a delight. Easily one of the best beers Ive had in this family.","Trenton, New Jersey, USA","lemasney"
618,"2008-02-07",3.6,"Nice slightly bitter chocolate aroma.  Pours an opaque black, with a big tan head.  Flavor is hints of chocolate, roast, and a touch of a sour taste.

618,"2008-02-03",3.8,"Bottle. Pours a deep dark brown with dark brown head. Aroma is of hersheys chocolate syrup with some hints of roasted malt and oat. Flavor is rich and chocolaty with a cocoa powder bitter edge to it leading to a dryer bittersweet finish. Mouthfeel is not thin by any means but thinner than the rich flavor would lead you to expect, making it easy drinking. I was pleased to find it balancing towards bitter more than sweet.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","MadMan"

Flavor is pretty sweet, roasted malts, lots of hops and what I am led to believe is chocolate but Im not sold on that flavor standing out like I expected.  Best closer to room temperature, this lends itself towards a creaminess with some good sherry-like nuttiness.

Head is frothy, light brown, has fair lacing, and is mostly lasting. Color is opaque black. Flavor starts lightly sweet and acidic, and the long finish is lightly acidic and heavily bitter like semisweet chocolate. Palate is light to medium, dry yet creamy, has a lively carbonation, and finishes moderately astringent and very dry. This reminds me of an after dinner espresso.

I know what it is. It smells exactly like chocolate Ovaltine. Like right on the button. This is a bed time beer, 100%.

618,"2008-01-09",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 10, 2008 I guess Im man enough to confess that I got pwn3d by this beer.

Not pwn3d the way I got pwn3d by a bottle of the Abyss that I opened after getting home from a hard night Uber. No, this was worse. It started off almost boring; this was the last of the ""accessible top 50"" for me, even though its in most every grocery store around here, andI figured I may as well tried it. I bought a bottle, and while I didnt really look forward to drinking it, the prospect of panning it in my review here gave me at least something enjoyable to anticipate.

Why? Chalk it up to some combination of character flaws on my part, perhaps best explained with reference to Seattle coffee-geek culture. Along with beer, Im a bit of a coffee geek as well, continually obsessing over the latest pro-series rotary pump espresso machines and conical burr grinders, procuring my espresso beans only from ultra-geek David Schomer (Espresso Vivace), going through a half-dozen shots in the morning to calibrate extraction times, the whole nine yards. So anyway, seeing this beer on the accessible top 50 list was like when some colleague of mine finds out that Im into coffee and wants to take me to try the amazing one she found the other day and we get there and it turns out to be a Starbucks and then she orders me a double decaf soy frappaccino with Irish Cream syrup and if she wasnt such a babe Id either be laughing in her face or dumping the coffee into a potted plant and instead Im setting there across the table from her trying to choke the damn thing down while keeping my eyes at or above the horizontal.  

Yeah, so a seemingly-highly rated Rogue concoction with ""natural chocolate flavor."" Could there be a more perfect set for the ultimate drainpour slam review? Basically, this one was floating up there soft and gentle, just hovering above the net, the perfect set. And I was Karch Kiraly looming in to spike this baby home and bury it two feet in the sand and leave the two bastards on the either side of the net looking around for their now-stained jockstraps. 

And I crack it open, and pour it into a snifter, and I inhale, its a perfect facsimile of a chocolate milkshake from Johnny Rockets and I burst out laughing because its all too perfect and damn am I going to slam this thing on Ratebeer for being a syrup-added pseudo-stout for the Bartles & James set. So I take a sip, getting ready to pound that last nail into the coffin, and wait....

...what the hell is this....?

I like it....its got a serious hop bite on the finish that actually compensates for all that darn chocolate, maybe even almost complements it...nah....its got to be a first sip sorta thing, all of the flaws are going to come out in the second sip and man Im going to trash this thing on ratebeer, and then I take a second sip, and a third, and all the flaws are there, and the chocolate is syrupy indeed, but damn this is a pretty enjoyable beer anyway, and then Im 18 ounces in, and almost regretting -- no, I am regretting -- that there are only a few sips left and wondering what to drink next and not really feeling quite in the mood for my usual favorites like a saison or belgian ale, they seem too...challenging right at the moment after this wonderful chocolate syrupbeersoda, and I get up, and carry glass across the room, and I look in the mirror, and there I see a beer geek struggling to hang on to the last vestiges of self respect by pouring this one down the drain....but instead the bastard gulps down the last few sips and stands there like an idiot, smiling at how good it tastes.

Aroma: obvious roastiness, chocolate malts and flavoring, mud and cocoa powder. Flavor was fairly sweet, like the end of a cup of hot coca or chocolate milk.

Was also disappointed with the aftertaste: seemed too short and not deep enough. I expected a longer, more robust, richer, roasted flavor throughout: a bigger body in other words. Would also have liked more bitterness, but hey, Im not the brewer. After my initial impressions wore off I started to really appreciate this beer.

Oats are apparent but not overwhelming. Medium body. Palate is long lasting with a surrounding grassy hop with mixing of chocolate.

Pours very dark brown/black with a large brown head that leaves globs of lacing and reduces to a rocky island and ring.  Aroma features layers of chocolate, dark chocolate, bakers chocolate, chocolate syrup, chocolate milk.  There is a bit of earthy hops, coffee, roasted malt and bread underneath all that chocolate.  Sometimes there is a bit of a sour milk and smoke characteristic on the nose.  Flavor is quite chocolaty, not as strong as the nose, fair amount of bitterness, some caramel, roasted malt, a bit acidic.  Mouthfeel is a little thin, but soft, low carbonation.  Good for a chocolate fix.

618,"2007-07-05",3.9,"1000th rater.  Been waiting a bit for this honey.  22oz bomber, not terribly fresh, picked it up in a store I figure has had it for more than a year on the self.  As usual I love the silk screen bottles and the community aspect this brewery provides. I pour it into my Chimay Goblet glass, I just think this beer (and most Rogue beers) deserve better than the English pint as suggested by Ratebeer or the mug that is hoisted on the label.  Pours black with a small but present tan head.  It soon fades to a strong lacing that is super sticky to the sides of this goblet.  A very presentable beer from bottle to glass.  Aroma is strong and what hits me first, surprisingly, is actually a stinging hop bite of pine trees.  Then comes the rush of chocolate, which comes as a shock because it was hops that my nose first picked up.  The chocolate overwhelms any sense of hoppiness.  And its not just your regular candy bar chocolate but a very bittersweet, naturally creamy, and a bit harsh kind of chocolate.  Its a type of chocolate that little kids would kind of not enjoy.  Taking a step back to the hoppiness I pick up, I am always amazed how Rogues hop profile stands up to age.  Its as if they threw in a whole lots of hops and said well lets pack as much damn chocolate in here as possible.  Trying to see what they can fill the beer up more with, hops or choclate.  Not that the chocolate is overbearing but again when its not artificial it can only be good.  So overall its a chocolate stout with a forest feel that comes from the piney hops and the real, bitter chocolate.  Now to the taste.  Does not start off with an onslaught of chocolate as one would think. More like creamy chocolate accented thick maltiness (thick shake beer), which then rolls off into a lighter, piney, excited spiky flavor.  Starts off soothing and sweet with a felt presence on the palate and ends up light and wild jumping all over your cheeks, from the hops.  Mouthfeel is nice, a very creamy texture almost like chocolate milk but then halfway down one feels the carbonation and it ends with a medium-light hop bitterness to round it off an bring it all back into the beer realm.  Leaves a long, lightly chocolate milk, and lightly piney expressive aftertaste.  One downside, I get a slight mineral quality at the end of the taste.  Its this battle between chocolate and piney hops that embodies the whole beer and the brewers at Rogue found the best middle ground so they can both shine.  This is also probably where other ""chocolate"" beers go astray, they forget to offset the chocolate.  No hint of alcohol at all, one could drink this and completely forget that its really above a session beers abv, I think I am starting to feel it now.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

618,"2007-06-07",4.2,"Appearance: Pours black with brown highlights and a sizeable cappuccino head, which while its initially rather pillowly, doesnt last for very long.

Smell: I havent had one of these in awhile, but friends, I can tell you quite categorically... it smelled exactly as I remembered.

Largely black roasted malts blended with toasted caramel, a rich earthiness, and just the merest amount of hops.

Taste: Sweeping chocolate taste (as in a bakers chocolate, not the overly sweet chocolate youd get at Easter as a kid), with a dash of espresso and a hint of almond. The finish is slightly bitter and plentiful, reminiscent of a fresh espresso or a fine cocoa powder.

Mouthfeel: Medium-thin; a bit lighter than I would prefer. Thankfully, its not overly fizzy, keeping it creamier on the tongue.

Drinkability: Phenomenally well-balanced, and very drinkable. A good stout is tough to beat, thats for sure. 

Still though, you put a gun to my head and say ""name your #1""? I dunno. Gotta go, like, double stout. Or strong ale. Or a nice lambic. Or a good juicy IPA.

Mouthfeel is much thinner than anticipated, finish is primarily bitter. Flavor is decent, the chocolate doesnt come through as much as in the aroma and the bittering hops seem to have a tight grasp on the taste. Overall this is not one of my top picks, kind of bummed out. The regular Shakespeare is much better.

618,"2007-05-27",3.6,"Bomber in Atlanta, shared with Clinton, served cold in a wine glass. MA05/07.
App.:  BLACK, no light transmission, decent tight mocha head.
  
Aroma:  initial impression is vinous and fruity, sour cherries and tangy; milk chocolate-ish aroma after that; some vanilla and darker chocolate/cocoa as it warms.
  
Palate:  Medium-full body, soft carbonation with some sharpness, light powderiness but smooth overall.
  
Flav.:  lots of chocolate, but not all in a good way; some licorice and molasses, dark roasted malts; finishes with more obvious chocolate, some stone fruits, cocoa and darker chocolate; somewhat powdery with good bitterness.

Drinkable, but a bit simple and underwhelming.  I question using added flavours...","Nepean, Ontario, CANADA","probstblueribbon"

Finally getting around to trying this. Its been on my list to pick up many times but I always seem to pass it by, since its always available, in favor of seasonals or special releases. Poured black with a big 3 finger brown, creamy, ruddy head. I cant see a thing through this beer. Leaves spotty lacing throughout the entire drink.

This stuff smells amazing. Big notes of chocolate and cream. Mildly roasted barley and a small hint of coffe beans. Smells like dessert in a bottle. Fantastic.

Flavor has all the qualities of the aroma with a little extra. Starts off with the creamy milk chocolate. Roasted malts and coffee grounds come through mid-palate as the chocolate starts to fall back. On the swallow theres a mild hop spiciness and coffee ground bitterness. 

Medium bodied and somewhat creamy. Lively in the back of the throat. My only complaint, and its a very small one, is the mouthfeel could stand to be a little more creamy. Still very nice though.

This chocolate stout is an easy one to put back. Wonderful flavor and aromas make it a pleasure to drink.

Im surprised at how good this stout really is. I wasnt sure if it could live to the hype or not. I wish I would have picked this up sooner. Another great beer from Rogue.

Tight carbonated body, with a nice roasty flavor throughout. Dark chocolate malts mesh nicely with a surprisingly hoppy character; especially for a sweet stout.

Good amout of bittering balancing the sweet.  Not really a sipper, but not something youd want to slam either; drinkability is excellent.  A little heavy on the belly, but its a chocolate stout, so thats understandable.  Great quality; nothing fake or cloying here. Definitely would try again!

Taste is more of bittersweet chocolate due to the roasted malts and barley.  I thought the body would be thicker and smooth, and perhaps would leave an oily coating on the palate.  However, the body is of medium thickness and  there is a slight fizz on the tongue at the finish.  I was in the mood for chocolate ice cream so this worked well.

Appearance: Pours a jet black with a beautiful, creamy, red tinted 2 finger head that dissipates within a few minutes and leaves some lacing around the edge of my glass. This stout is pure eye candy.

Smell: Coffee, chocolate, and brown sugar. 

Taste: An initial very rich dark chocolate with minor hop bitterness thrown in, followed up by a pure cocoa powder. This is called Chocolate Stout for a reason. 

Mouthfeel: If there is a weak point to this stout, it has to be the mouthfeel. This one is on the thin side. It is not a bad mouthfeel by any means, I was just expecting (and hoping) for a creamier, fuller body. 

Drinkability: This stout is pretty drinkable, especially if you are a chocolate lover. I, myself, am not a huge chocolate fan, but I will have no problem drinking this 22oz bottle.

Aroma of milk & dark chocolate, dark malt, and vodka/alcohol. Had to sit down to drink this, as it made my knees weak. WOW. Great malting, seamlessly incorporates chocolate flavouring. Oats evident in both taste and body. Not too shy on the hops, either - grassy, almost Fugglicious but apparently not (Cascade? Really?) Taste starts out with sweet chocolate and crystal malts, segues into teriyaki & hops, evens out with roasted barley, chocolate malt, hops, and brown rice. Carbonation perfect, body creamy and thick. There are some late hop additions here, which make it rather bold for a sweet stout. My first American craft-brew, and I am very impressed!

Taste; as with the smell the chocolate is the dominant flavor, which isnt surprising since this is a chocolate stout. A touch of coffee bitterness is oresent, as well as a little bit of a smokey quality. this isnt to complex in the flaovr department, but it is still very good.

618,"2006-11-16",3.9,"Ebony pour produces a mocha head equal in height to the liquid; the lather displays the density and longevity of foam rubber. Nose initially exhibits briery berry and vinous notes, but soon settles into a phenominal fanfare of rich milk chocolate, cocoa powder, toasted almonds, clove, grape jam, Jaegermeister, and mint. (Toward the end of the glass, the bouquet fluctuates between the former and the latter like that girl that looks hot one day and gnarly the next.) Similarly, the first sip is startlingly fruitycranberry? crabapple? before finding a comfortable balance of decadent dark chocolate, nutty barley, dried fig, and truffles. Tartness and carbonation provide a tangy finish. Mouthfeel starts out luxurious and frothy, but develops into a firm yet slimy snaily buildup by the bottles end. Concludes with a deep aftertaste of bitter chocolate, expresso, and smoke that completely saturates the senses. One can actually feel the chocolate molecules augering into the brain and infusing into the carotid .

There are a few stouts that are really great but are a little bit too rich to enjoy on a regular basis (not to mention over the top expensive.  This brew is not only accessible but inexpensive.

Aroma is so enticing to this chocolate lover: smells slightly malty at first, but then the nose is immediately take over by dark chocolate, cocoa, and even brownie mix aromas.  So nice!  These are not weak aromas either.  Taste follows a simliar fashion: some light malt flavors right before the brownie mix kicks in and coats your mouth with its delicious creamy goodness.  Beer is not quite as thick as youd expect, but its still nice and creamy, neiter sticky nor cloying.  Finish is not what youd expect and has a noticable hop taste.  The hops meld with the cocoa flavors very nicely and dont feel tacked on.  Still, these are the smoothest 69 IBUs Ive ever tasted.  Yummy!","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

Chocolate absolutely everywhere in the mouth, front to back, both bittersweet and milk chocolate. Some roast, too, a little sharpness of coffee and some bitters in the finish. Thick body but not sticky or syrupy, and the chocolate flavors do *not* come with overwhelming sweetness. Very refreshing and drinkable, especially by stout standards.

I then waitesd 20 minutes, and what a difference. Great aroma of chocolate and toffee, smelled like fresh made Turtle candy. Taste was more of the malty chocolate, but finely balanced by enough hops to not be too sweet.

The aroma was of chocolate. The flavor was an initially sweet and roasted chocolate that turned lightly bitter. Hops were detectable and nice, certainly not overpowering.

A good balance between the chocolate, bitterness and sweetness.  But, the third bottle tasted completely out of whack.  The choco-sweetness was somewhat nauseating.

This makes a great dessert!","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","tcruicks"
618,"2006-05-23",4.2,"Pours brownish black with a dense foamy tan head.  I cant think of a darker non-imperial stout.  The nose is bittersweet chocolate up front with roasty semisweet malt and a liberal (for the style) piney hop note.  Tiny foamy little bubbles on the tongue take this average viscosity beer and really make it very smooth and pleasant in the mouth.  The flavors are also extremely enjoyable.  The malty sweetness up front with obvious dark rich roasted notes and chocolate following.  Theres also some of those piney cascade notes coming through just after the chocolate, and it works in a strange way.  Theres something slightly acidic (stronger than Coke) about this brew, which I tend not to enjoy in general, but feels appropriate against the backdrop of the roasty lingering charcoal aftertaste.  This is mighty bold for a sweetstout, perhaps why its my favorite so far!","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

How: Bottle 660ml, consumed fresh a few weeks after purchase
The look: Black body topped by a small beige head
In long: Liquid black chocolate.  Nice hopping with what appear to be some citric hops bringing a light astringency.  The problem is mainly the body that I find a bit thin for the style.  I expect a chocolate stout to be creamy and full, this one is light bodied and a bit floury dry.  Light fruity salad notes as the beer warms up.  Despite its lack of oomph this is a very good beer.  As simple as a Hollywood movie plot but quite enjoyable.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

618,"2006-03-13",4.5,"On tap.Pours a thick dark brown-black; forms a thinnish mocha head that slowly dissipates to a persistent thin layer on top. Beautiful aroma that is at once chocolatey, spicy and a bit piney. Flavor is nice tight bakers chocolate, medium roast coffee, sweet yet dry malt. Spicy, somewhat piney hops add an interesting element. If someone were to describe to me a chocolate stout with notable piney notes, Id imagine it tasting kind of gross. But the piney and spicy nature of the hops unexpectedly complements rather than detracts from the base chocolate character. Rogue seems to strike a perfect balance here and my guess is that any attempt by anyone else to replicate it would likely come off tasting awkward. Palate is impossibly smooth as it slides down like a chocolate milkshake.

Starts sharp and bitter, then quickly mellows to a roasted malty flavor and in between one finds the chocolate. Finishes a bit like a good ipa, the bitter chocolate blends well with the floral hops. Very good; this is MY kind of stout. Looking forward to it again next year.","Pocatello, Idaho, USA","paulmetzger"

Aroma, distincly burnt dark chocalate was not impressive to me, but mine was slightly cooler than it should be to start.

Very tastily enjoyed during the Superbowl with dark chocolate being the overriding theme with hop bitterness noticeable throughout.  The aftertaste was surprisingly minimal.  Would drink again, perhaps as a dessert beer.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","kseecs16"

618,"2006-01-27",4.5,"Rogue Chocolate Stout pours to a beautiful deep ebony color, with a thick, creamy tan head, and a soft carbonation. The first thing that strikes you with this beer is the nose. Incredible chocolate aromas of cocoa, dark chocolate, and roast, flood the nose. The palate is luxuriously delicious. Flavors of bitter sweet dark chocolate, roasted barley, and sweet maltiness coat the tongue. A portion of oats is used in this beer, making it silky smooth and creamy, as it slides down the throat. Rogue Chocolate Stout finishes as impressive as it started. More bitter sweet chocolate flavors up front, followed by some coffee flavor, bitter roastiness, and just a kiss of hop bitterness to balance out this exceptional brew. 

WOW. This beer is like drinking a chocolate truffle. There is chocolate in this beer, and you can tell. This beer as an absolute must for chocolate lovers. A perfect desert beer that would match extremely well with, what else? Chocolate. Pair this glorious beer with milk chocolates, or perhaps a rich and decadent death by chocolate cake. The roasty flavors in this beer, really are wonderful when you pair it with a sweet and creamy chocolate desert. Stout and chocolate is a match made in heaven. I highly recommend this beer.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

Other aromas include oats, caramel, licorice, vanilla, sweet cigar/pipe tobacco.  Very mouth-watering aroma.  Wow, incredible flavor.  Initially sweet and earthy with a strong taste of oats and ultra smooth floral hops, and finishes like a really good coffee (bitter, but not overly so) with rich dark chocolate in the aftertaste.  This beer has so many complex flavors in it - in addition to the ones mentioned in the aroma, there is brown sugar, molasses, espresso, raisins, and butterscotch, and a smoky finish.  In addition to the gratifying hop kick, the texture is silky smooth and creamy.","Holly Springs, North Carolina, USA","bmanning"

This beer pours a jet black and leaves a silky brown head that looks like you poured too much vanilla in your whipped cream. As I smell this beer all the aromas I talked about milk chocolate, brown butter(butterscotch), coffee, floural hops, caramel, sugar, vanilla, are all on display in this beer. The taste of this beer just explodes on your palate. It starts with a vanilla chocolate sweetness then moves to a bitter hop kick followed by a coffee essence and finally finishes with a silky smooth butterscotch aftertaste.

Starts out pretty roasty, with some coffee and dry chocolate notes. Strange, I was expecting this to be sweeter. Finishes rather bitter, with some hops and alcohol coming out at the end. Pretty dry overall, wondering why this is a sweet stout. Lacking a bit in the body. A bit too much carbonation on the end, a big pet peeve of mine. Mediocre.","Detroit, Michigan, USA","JoshuaB"

Its my regular beer now and Ive had a few times to revisit this. The pour is a nice very dark brown with a rocky tan head. It probably looks black in most normal light, but on the sun-shiny deck of the Fox & Parrot, I can see some brown. Aroma packs sweet chocolate, but then theres the firm, bright hop presence. Same thing in the mouth: rich chocolate, some coffee, and a surprising amount of hoppy biterness for sweet stout.

618,"2005-09-26",4.2,"If there was an Iron Chef of brewing, and the secret ingredient was chocolate, this brew would wow the judges.  Tons of chocolate on the nose.  Sweet chocolate, swiss chocolate, Hersheys cocoa, and oats, oats, oats!  Impermeable dark brown beer with little to no head, but who cares?  The chocolate is the star here.  Tasting involves the nose as much as the palate.  Hops up front, melding into a cake-like chocolate center.  The earthiness of the oats rounds out the chocolate and malts finish the job.  Palate is my only complaint.  Not too creamy for a milk stout, and I miss the length of Mackeson in the olden days.  But for the treatment of a single ingredient, this is a blue ribbon beer.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","jefcon"

It smells grainy, doughy, with notes of chocolate and coffee.    The head is creamy but fairly short in height and life.  The taste is very layered, with sweetness first, then the malt and hops.  Its layered, but balanced.  Not too much of anything in there, with a nice black coffee finish.  The alcohol is there too, but its mostly hidden amongst the layers.  A good brew for sure!

It becomes a rather monstrous stout actually, chocolate flavored or not. I love you Rogue. Now Im wondering if I shoulda ordered TWO cases of the Tsarina Katerina...

<P>Pours ever so dark with fine tall head... Wow...memories of St-Ambroise (another oatmeal stout with a variety of dark malts and hops.) Well-made stout although the dry cocoa aroma from the added ""chocolate flavoring"" is a bit up there and in-your-nostrils. Too much of a good thing? -or- would I just complain if it werent so kookoo for cocoa puffs? I have to scrounge up a few more to qualify a less Newbie opinion of this one. Miles of lingering pleasant bitter finish.

618,"2005-08-14",4.1,"22 oz bottle, cellared for about 1&1/2 years.  Pours a nice thick black pint with a craggy chocolate brown head.  Smells wonderful with lots of roasted barley and chocolate.  Had to get my nose in there real deep to suck up the wonderful aroma.  Thick full-bodied mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation.  Packed full of flavor, reminds me of dessert in a glass.  The chocolate really comes out in this brew but not in a sickening sweet way.  The finish hangs out for a long time and sets you up for the next sip nicely.  This is one of my favorites, Ive been drinking this for about 3 years since I tried it at a beerfest where it was served by the woman on the bottle herself.  Cellaring  has certainly not hurt this one.  I find that it has led to a lot of sedimentation that has left the beer a lot brighter and cleaner tasting.  This one deserves a try if you come across it.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
618,"2005-08-09",3.7,"Tap. Had this in a sampler yesterday. I didnt take notes but remember a black color with a good sized brown head.

Dark chocolate accents help to balance bitterness.  One of the best bitter-edged stouts Ive had in awhile.  Seems to be a less aggressive version of their Imperial Stout.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Appearance: black, brown-tan head that has OK retention, good lacing and noticable sub-surface ""racing.""  Flavor was of burnt sugar, burnt roast bitterness emerging in the finish, which was nicely long.  NIce level of sweetness and a creamy/buttery mouthfeel.  Not enough body though, and too fizzy; it wasnt ""stout"" enough, more like a porter with a stout level of flavor.  Overall: very enjoyable.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Light brown head. Lovely little bubbles. Body is thick - lacing the glass and leaving the bubbles behind. Initial smells are a bit of the roasted malts, mostly chocolate though. And after your first taste, all you smell or taste is the dark chocolate. Its as if you took a piece of 80% cocoa lindt chocolate and just let it dissolve on your tongue. Delicious.

Initially a sweet milk chocolate, and richer, darker chocolate as the glass progresses. Great creamy palate. Good roast and coffee flavors. A surprisingly dry finish, with lingering, bitter dark-chocolate. A solid stout with some nice chocolate notes, rather than a chocolate drink with stout hiding somewhere underneath.

Pours black with a fizzy dark brown head, almost as dark as the beer itself.  The aroma smells like fresh baked semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Probably the chocolatiest aroma Ive smelled yet.  Taste is of some roasted malt with a sweet dark chocolate taste, with very little bitterness.  More chocolatey than Youngs Double Chocolate.  I can envision it now, some dark brown cartoon character with a strange accent, holding a bottle and saying, ""Everyone wants to get a hold of my Rogue Chocolate Stout!""  Body feels somewhat thin and undercarbonated, the weakest point of the beer.

618,"2005-02-07",3.8,"2004 bomber.  Fantastic pour as usual, per Rogue.  Bottle conditioned, unpasteurised, tons of sediment and a creamy, tan colored head.  Aroma hints at the chocolate, with minor notes of roast, yeast and barley.  Not much hops apparency in the nose, and as I drink it, not much hops apparency in the flavor either.  Which is fine with me.  Strange, though, because it says this has 69 IBUs.  Starts out with a very light mocha coffee flavor, some roasted barley notes emerge, followed by a light chocolate syrup flavor.  Finish has yeast, mineral water, some chalk and more roast and chocolate.  Altogether, the chocolate is well-controlled, with no syrupy sweetness or artificial flavors, but the body is very light for a stout.  I agree exactly with bitter, if they would have upped the OG a bit more, it would have made this much more satisfyingly stoutish.  I think I prefer the more complex, salty, roasty Shakespeare.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

That last other two beers I tasted tonight had no heads so I poured glass #1 a bit too hard and got a HUGE head that was fun to watch fall into billowy, cloud-like shapes. #2 poured a nice 2 finger head that stuck around for a miute or two and left me with a nice ""coating"" head. Head was mocha brown. I got nice lacing throughout the glass. The nose is roasted malt, extra bitter 70% chocolate with some tart fruit undertones. The nose was much more pronounced on glass #2, no doubt because of the raise in temp. Roasty flavor, a hint of turkish coffee, and extra-bitter 70% chocolate that melds into a sweeter  (bittersweet, not sweet)  chocolate taste. Some backing hops that give it orange peel? notes .

618,"2004-11-29",4.5,"22oz Bomber. This one pours a nice black color with a great dark brown frothy head with good size. Head retention is good and it leaves a nice brown lacing about the glass. The aroma coming of this one is of heavy chocolate with a slight floral hoppiness mingling about. Some coffee can also be detected in the smell. The taste was excellent all the great qualities of a stout were present with the taste of dark chocolate. It seems the coffee flavor can out on the backside as an after taste; also there was some bitterness present. Mouthfeel was full bodies and creamy. Overall all this is a truly great beer, the chocolate is defiantly there but no overwhelming. This second half of the bomber went great with some good dark chocolate. Highly recommended, rogue does a magnificent job again.","Sterling, Virginia, USA","meathookjones"

Fairly big hop aroma up front mixed with the roasty malt and dark chocolate notes reminds me a lot of the Olfabrikken Porter I had earlier today. The body is ruby/black with a lasting, craggy, mocha colored head. Big chocolate, graham cracker, cocoa, ginger bread (I swear) flavor on the fore. I taste hints of green branches and herbal hop notes int he finish. Smooth with a great mouthfeel, but not even remotely how I remember this beer tasting.

Some caramel, some espresso notes, but its all about the chocolate in this one.  Low fruitiness.  Very chocolatey flavor w/ some dark grain & hop bitterness. Light roastiness in the finish and has a light hop flavor in the aftertaste. Also has hints of caramel, but again, chocolate dominates.  Higher medium carbonation(possibly from being on tap), prickly m/f, medium body and smooth after it warms.  Sort of 1dimensional in the fact that the dominant flavor and aroma is chocolate.  It pretty much masks a lot of the other malts and grains that were probably used.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

I guess Id just love it more would another less citric hop replace those astringent cascades.

The last time I had this stout it wasnt as chocolatey as I remembered it.  Before that I would have said it was one of my top 5 brews but now I think it dropped down.  Still a really good stout and a must-try.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","biznizness"
618,"2004-07-08",4.3,"A delicious treat.  Pours out black with a frothy tan head.  The aroma was chocolate laced with roasted coffee.  There was some astringency in the mouth but it was creamy and smooth and full bodied.  The flavor was a carry over from the aroma: chocolate laced with coffee.  Perhaps one-dimensional but its a great dimension.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"

Pours a jet-black color with an enticing brown head, similar to what you would see atop a freshing stirred glass of chocolate milk.  Which leads to the predomintate essence of this beer...chocolate.

Flavor is mostly chocolate with coffee.  The chocolate flavor is more of a dark chocolate.  Finishes a little on the  bitter side.  Very smooth mouthfeel.  Bitter and coffee aftertaste that is relatively long lasting.  Ive only had one other chocolate stout that I liked a lot (Youngs Double Chocolate Stout) and that one seemed to have more of a creamy chocolate flavor as opposed to the dark chocolate.  This ones good, but is not nearly as good as the Youngs.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
618,"2004-05-19",4.1,"Rogue does it again with this wonderful example of the style! Pours an extremely dark body. Looks almost black. Head is a foamy brown masterpeice. Some sediment at the bottom of my glass as well. Aroma is roasted chocolate magnificence with a slight hoppy edge. Taste is chocolate with some roasted hints in it. Smooth mouthfeel, followed by a pleasant bitter bite on the palate. Nice one Rogue! Thanks goes out to IPFreely for grabbing me a bottle of this.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"
618,"2004-05-16",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 9, 2007 Pours black with a giant brown head of smoothe texture, lumpy as it fades.  Foam coats the glass as you drink; lacing improves dramatically when beer is not overly cold and creates a tan curtain(my curtain has vanished, mostly! ahhh!).  Aroma is very yeasty in an earthy way, strong milk chocolate malts.  Little carbonation, but silky; on the full side of medium body, slightly watery finish, not very dry.  Side note: a large amount of sediment came out of the bottle upon rinsing.  Definite toasty bitter throughout, strong milk chocolate malts hold the top and the finish is almost balanced; bitter, chocolaty, long lasting, slightly abrasive and almost ""yucky"" as it goes down, but the aftertaste is still pleasant, beer is smoothe.

9/9/2007
Bottled.  Filthy motor oil topped with a fluffy, big brown head, eventually leaving behind thick sheets of lace.  Head turns into a small ring and stops lacing.  Aroma of cream soda plus milk-chocolate (i.e. theres a lot of vanilla in there), oats, molasses, along with some yeasty grass and earth notes.  Very sweet aroma.  Tons of foamy carbonation on a light-but-full (right around creamy, but a bit thin) mouthfeel and a pleasantly dry finish.  Flavor is sour with yeast--sweat, grass, and wood; bitter with hops--toasted barley, and something almost grape-fruit rindy, but not...its close to pine, but its not (the alcohol is hiding in here, being rather transparent, but definitely contributing some astringence); malty like oats and milk chocolate.  Strong chocolate finish with a bitter, hop aftertaste.  Surprisingly sour.  Its funny to go three years without wanting something and then to suddenly crave it.  This has pretty well hit the spot.  Overall, its a sickening combo of something really sweet, sour, and bitter all rolled into one.  Enjoyed.","Reno, Nevada, USA","0o9i"
618,"2004-05-15",4.1,"The chocolate is dominating.  Sweet, not bitter.  Has some characteristics of an oatmeal stout.  Creamy but a little chewy/chalky.  No roasted/coffee notes at all which was a good for a change.","Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania, USA","SiddFinch"

Tastes very malty, with dark chocolate, vanilla, and slight anise at the finish.  This one reminds me a lot of the Ortliebs vanilla porter and the Valley Forge Georges porter.  I think our local PA guys have mimicked Rogue pretty well on this one.  A marvelous brew.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"

618,"2004-05-07",4.6,"WOW! What a stout! It is definitely one of the best stouts around. Ive had a cask-conditioned version of this chocolate stout previously but I have to say that the bottled version is definitely superior in every way.

This stout poured an almost opaque dark brown, almost like espresso coffee. The head was minimal and tan-colored, leaving only the slightest trace of lacing.

The aroma was VERY promising. Chocolate and hops all the way! The ultimate fulfillment was that first swig.... all chocolate and definitely delicious! It is a fabulous stout which I would highly recommend to any chocaholics like me! ;-)","New York, USA","BeerVixen"

Smooth, very smooth, and tasty. Chocolate taste is not shy, and lingers in the mouth.
Goodness gravy, this is delicious!

618,"2004-03-22",3.4,"Opening this bottle was a little like walking into a chocolate factory, the smell was everywhere.  While this may appear to be a good thing, it was detrimental to my opinion of this selection.  I did not enjoy the intense chocolate-y-ness of this one, way too much.  Tasted like other chocolate stouts, and had a rich creamy palate which was quite enjoyable.  Overall I think Rogue relied too much on creating the sense of drinking melted chocolate for this to be a great beer.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","jde123"
618,"2004-03-20",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 21, 2004  feel like Homer Simpson right now. Mmm.... Chocolate. The first smell after opening the 22 oz bottle was a bit hoppy with a hint of coffee, similar to the Shakespeare Stout. A deeper breath and the smell of Chocolate broke through quite clearly. When poured in a pint glass, it looked the part with an opaque brown body topped with a rough brown head. The taste is dominated by the presence of chocolate. Because of the strong flavoring, other tastes are a bit hard to distinguish. I can detect a bit of coffee, and burnt toast. Quite dry and a tad too harsh in the mouthfeel department, I think. It left me wishing for more maltyness and a smoother and sweeter body. This is definitely not to be chugged, but sipped and allowed to coat your throat and tongue as it goes down.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Distinct chocolate aroma, along with cola and a hint of coffee.  Color is black.  Flavor is quite good with a note of chocolate again.  The bitterness in the flavor and the finish surprised me though.  Was not expecting that.  Bitter and dry palate either from the bitter dark chocolate or some hops presence.  A good quality ""sweet stout"" which is not as sweet as you would expect.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"

Superb version.","New York, USA","DCopperfields"

Smooth and creamy, which makes it go down pretty easily.  However, I wouldn't recommend drinking this quickly, since it's more like eating a meal than drinking a beer.  The amount of hops were perfect to eep it from being overwhelmingly chocolatey.  Overall, a delicious find; one that I'll buy again and again.","Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, USA","rhapsouldize"

Original Rating : 1.8 Aroma 6, Appearance 5, Taste 2, Palate 1, and OVerall 4.Poured a nice dark brown with an awesome tan head. Aroma was of bitter chocolate and hops.

First taste tasted like it smelt...Fake, cheap chocolate. Nice rich malt flavour finishing with a slight flavour of roasted coffee. Palate... leaves flavour of roasted malts and that bad taste of chocolate again. If you can overlook the Quik flavour this stout isn't too bad but I couldn't.

BLACK in the glass (though it's a really really dark down when it pours) with a HUGE dark brown head. Looks creamy & frothy, like some sort of fancy coffee I've never had. Looks VERY chocolatey.

Sweet, roasted, nutty chocolate maltiness in the nose. Very nice.

BIG bite! tastes like cold coffee, with a hint of unsweetened chocolatey bitterness. Big and frothy, yet tender, like a gentle giant who just wants to pick a person up to look at them instead of eating them.

Not my favorite style by any means (I'm not a fan of chocolate), but this is one helluva beer. GREAT for it's style, and easily drinkable for all of those who can handle a hearty beer.

I don't drink much fancy coffee, but I'm sure this tastes like some kind of mocha roast latte-achino-spresso thing.  It makes me wish I did drink coffee.  Complimentary aromas of caramel, cream, and roasted chocolate malts are not lost in the mix.  The flavors are a decadent array of smooth and soft cocoas, burnt roasted marshmallow and fried banana.

The taste was at first of a creamy chocolate then ended with powdered cocoa or dark chocolate.  I greatly despise dark chocolate and dislike powdered cocoa.  All of the chocolate was tasted under the alcohol.

The head is like biting into the lightest, fluffiest, slightly sweet chocolate mousse.  The aroma is strongly of chocolate, it dominates the aroma of this beer.  Quite a creamy body, lightly sweet as well.  This beer finishes with a bit of dark malt and a subdued bitterness.  Just like the aroma, the chocolate is dominant in the taste of the beer as well.

Appearance: Think used motor oil with a light brown head. There is *no* light going through this glass.

Smells like malty chocolate with a hint of hops.

Taste...um, chocolate? Not crappy Hershey's or any other milk chocolates. It's definately imported dark chocolate. It's far from being too sweet, though, even with the roasted malt tastes. There's enough hops to keep it well balanced.

Mouthfeel is heavenly. Thick and well-carbonated.

Drinkability... Like I said, I'm not really into chocolate so I wouldn't be able to drink many of these. I've now had my chocolate fix that should last for another few months.

I felt like I was licking the inside of a carton that had a beer busted open inside of it.  Blech.  Once reached room temperature some chocolate emerged, but too little too late.

Opaque, deep black covered by a mammoth light brown head that is slow to fade.  Lots of sticky lace.  Powdered chocolate, day old chocolate licorice, and leafy hops make up its soft and rounded aroma.  Starts with a hoppy bang, then fades to a bittersweet chocolate center.  A leafy, green hop flavor and bitterness is present throughout, but is well balanced, keeping the chocolate in check.  The finish is fairly astringent, with a strong citric tang and firm bitterness that lasts and lasts  A bit light in body, but thats not surprising considering their high level of yeast attenuation...there's a reason they call it Pacman yeast!

Much much better than the Shakespeare Stout.  Sampled this with a bunch of buds and all of us immediately were shocked and in love.  Paid 8 dollars for a bottle at a rip-off place in Pennsy (you guys got to get real beer stores, not just cases and rip-offs). Amazingly great and infinitely better than the Young's Chocolate as well.

The malts are restrained, however, and do not overpower the senses. Had a decent 3 fingered head when poured, and slowly faded back to generous lacing down the sides of the glass. Tastes are of cocoa, chocolate malts, and earthy hops. It has a surprizing amount of hops bitterness for a beer of this style. Smooth, creamy texture, not thick & chewy like some.

I friend brought some over last week for my birthday party, and I was in love from first sip.  It smells like choclate milk.  It tastes like chocolate espresso with cream.  Mouthful is thick and creamy.  Initial malty chocolatey sweetness followed by bitter, burnt aftertaste.  Kind of like a Young's Double Chocolate Stout on steroids.","Fallbrook, California, USA","Kasteelfreak"

618,"2003-08-06",4.1,"Black as tar color,nice small but creamy brown head that lasted for quite awhile.The first whiff of this brew is astonishingly hops,with a mild fruit hint and the chocolate comes in last place.The malty aroma is quite subdued and faint,but there is definately a sweet qualitity coming through.It might just be that it's still a little colder then it should be for optimum aroma.Definately warmed up enough now,The chocolate comes through very loud and clear almost to the point of drinking nestle quick(chocolate of course)the hops aren't as prolific as they where in the aroma and there is no fruit in this that i can make out.The after taste is what else but chocolate with a slight bitter side to it and maybe some hops but it's hard to say with such an overwhelming amount of chocolate in the way it manages to stay quite hidden.I've never been a real big chocolate fan but this is something i could definately drink a lot of.It very well done and even though one sided IMO it is quite good.Well worth trying .","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"

It pours with a dark black color, but not completely opaque.  The aroma was of slight chocolate and a bit of coffee.  The aroma was disappointing as I expected more chocolate being a chocolate stout and all.  There was a bit more chocolate in the flavoring, but not all that much.  The beer is drinkable - much more than your usual stout - but that's not what I'm looking for.  It should be heavy, with complex flavors - but all you get here is a hint of chocolate and a little bit of hops and malt.  An interesting brew, and one I might drink again, but not something I'd hunt down.","Orange, California, USA","Blake"

Deep black hue is a coffee-brown under the scrutiny of a bright light.  Aroma is almost entirely of semi-sweet and milk chocolate.  Hints of roast, condensed milk, and peanuts.  Ever so slight floral hop aroma.  Oily sweetness up front with a tingling blend of carbonation and roasty acidity.  Finishes with a distinct malt taste (like whoppers) and a light floral-citric hop profile.  Medium body with a very watery texture and moderate carbonation.  Metallic/mineral feel to the beer.  Wow, has my palate ever changed.  Heavy cookie, chocolate(light and dark), and coffee malt aroma.  Hops are almost missing in the nose.  Light, sweat yeaty smell with a hint of vanilla perhaps.  Average creamy, light-brown head and opaque, black body are very tempting.  Flavor starts out extremely sweet  and the bitterness and acidity kick up a little at the end.  Chocolate all the way through.  Creamy, full texture with a moderate amount of carbonation.  Almost feels like soda with chocolate syrup added.  Thank goodness the cascades are hidden so well.  Cake...in a bottle.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

Taste is fluffy semi-sweet chocolate and chocolate milk with sweet soda like carbonation with a nice chocolatey sweet twinge, trace of hops, breadish in the finish thats tangy with a light thinning dryness. Favorable to chocolate milk with coco-puffs cereal. What a treat!

618,"2003-05-31",3.2,"I enjoy  good chocolate and stout so I was really looking forward to this one. The initial smell was disappointing,  reminiscent of a stale Hershey bar. A second inhalation revealed some hop aroma and rich roasted and malty notes, but not much chocolate  The  beer was a deep black in color, and the head, which was very slow to dissipate, was a rich medium brown, milk chocolate on top of dark. There was considerable thick lacing. The flavor was lightly bitter and hoppy with overtones of malt, espresso coffee and, yes, chocolate. The chocolate flavor was weak, and I wonder why the people at Rogue chose to call this a chocolate stout. This is more of a mocha stout in my opinion, since the coffee flavor definitely dominates. In texture and mouthfeel this beer was a lot lighter than other chocolate stouts I have tried, approaching a porter. Not a bad brew but for a chocolate lover like me definitely disappointing.","east falmouth, Massachusetts, USA","Lizabeth"

Gretchen there on the bottle didn't transfer well to a painted label -- though I'm sure that she's a charming young lady in person. Cocoa, roast, coffee bittering and moderate hops. A little sugary sweet both in aroma and flavor for me -- it almost came off as artificial or extractive -- somewhat similar to my experience with their Hazelnut, which everyone else seems to rave about, but also disappoints me.

This beer poured black as the night and formed a huge foamy dark tan head the left an almost full coat of lace on the sides as is subsided. Okay, the aroma smells of malt and chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate. Coca comes out the the sweet chocolate to offset it a bit. The flavor was of malt, burnt chocolate and a touch of coffee. The finish was fairly light for this style and had a slight bitterness to it. I prefer this to Young's any day of the week","Ohio, USA","Gunshy"

618,"2003-01-20",4.4,"This is the most chocolatey beer I have ever had! I sampled a little chocolate with it. I think my chocolate was too cheap, it didn't compliment very well. Dark black-brown that will not let the light through. Dark brown head and a bitter sweet finish. With a chocolatey nose to it. All make this stout great. Everything compliments each other quite well. By far one of the better brews I have had. Excellent job.","Brantford, Ontario, CANADA","Cartoonkhaki"

618,"2003-01-15",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 8, 2013 Draft & bottle, multiple times - Pours a rich dark brown with a light brown head, not very long lasting.  Smells of caramel?  First taste on my tongue was mild and slightly sweet.  Midway through the mouthfull the richness of the stout makes its entrance, but by the end of the drink, your mouth is punched by the fist of sour.  Im re-rating it now, because Ive feel in love with it.  The semi-sweet richness in both the drink and the finish is such a wonderful feeling.  Drink this with a chocolate bar and youll love it.  Smokey, rich, not too sweet, with what I would think is a fairly complex finish consisting of subtle roasted malts, big chocolate malts, and some semi-sour baking chocolate characteristics.  One of my favorites now.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

618,"2003-01-05",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2003  Sampled from 46 deg to 58 deg F.
Absolutely one of the best sweet stouts I've ever had! The color was an ominous blackened brown with a dark beige head. The aroma was dominated by bittersweet chocolate, but still had some nice hops (Cascade) citrusy tones, lactic acidity, and a sweet malty character. The flavor was chocolaty, malty, hoppy (more so than the aroma) with just a slight roasted coffee tone. The mouthfeel is this beer's only drawback...it is not bad, just not perfect. A little on the watery side...just needing a little bit more carbonation. The aftertaste is this beer's best asset...pure chocolate goodness...very much like chocolate milk. I figure if you're going to make a chocolate stout, then you might as well go all the way. Rogue hit a homerun with this one!","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"

Great thick pour, a true motor oil beer with a dark tan head reminescent of St. Ambroise or perhaps even darker; roasted oatmeal/chocolate aroma with a bitter palate right up front - perhaps strangely bitter for the style.  Extremely dry finish.  THICK.  Im a stout drinker and there was something small left to be desired after this one - Ill re-rate it in a  few weeks just to make sure I didnt catch my palate on a bad day.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","jpknight22"
618,"2003-01-04",4.6,"The aroma of this one floored me (in a good way!) as soon as I opened the bottle: rich, dark, bitter-sweet chocolate.

Very good stout!","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
618,"2003-01-04",3.5,"Having been disappointed by these guys in the past, I must admit I battle a Rogur prejudice when I sample their brews.

The lace seemed to match the head. The aroma was of chocolate, malt, and with hints of hops and fruit. The flavor was chocolate, slightly bitter, and malty. Then a small wave of a slight sweet fruit came up and then left. The finish was chocolaty and some hops showed. A very tasty beer that is named correctly. I wish I had more.",", USA","CherokeeJarod"

Dark chocolate and milk chocolate too.  Tastes like a rich, creamy hershey kiss.  I could drink this all night long.  The hops do a good job of balancing out the whole package, but I'll remember it for the chocolate, which is all over the aroma, the flavor and the finish. Later on the same night I drank a half of a Butte creek porter and a bit of a Deschutes Jubelale and I could still taste the Chocolate stout over 'em all!!!  Love this stuff!!","Richmond, Virginia, USA","GermanBrews76"
618,"2002-12-01",4.1,"The reason this beer is so good is that it is not sweet for the sake of being sweet, and it is balanced. The traditional Rogue hoppiness is the fronline of this beer, after the tip of your tongue recoils from the initial hop shock, a rich chocolatiness blankets the palate and then you realize...this is really good. Chocolate malts and licquor flavors are everywhere in this beer, the aroma, the flavor, it even looks like chocolate. Very good.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"

Roasty chocolate flavor with a very apparent cocoa component, lightly sweet and with a hoppy finish.  Aftertaste is chocolate and fading to a light bitterness.  Creamy consistency.  Um, its okay, but to me the chocolate tastes extremely fake, again like a Tootsie Roll.  I know its real chocolate, but it doesnt taste like it to me.  22 ozs. of this was far too much for me.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

Huge blackberry and bubblegum nose and undernotes of cocoa, phenolic hints, leafy hop, and a whisper of alcohol.  Very unfamiliar grape bubblegum flavors lead most of the way before the onslaught of dry, bitter chocolate and tea-like notes and some softness.  Pleasantly subtle acidity in the finish with lingering traits of bakers chocolate.  The palate is surprisingly rather thinner than I remember it.  I am surprised how unintersting this tasted.  I remember the chocolate and palate being much bigger.  Still a beer I like to enjoy a few times a year.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

The aroma, flavor and aftertaste have a wonderful dark chocolate flavor, sorta like the semi-sweet chocolate morsels used in homemede cookies .  Hop bitterness is noticed in the first few sips, which complemented the flavor nicely. It tasted better as I drank it (probably was a bit too cold at first).

I have looked into the abyss... All the light in the room was sucked right into the glass. A large, tan, rocky head. Completely lasting with excellent lacing. The flavor surprised me. I detected no hops in the nose (give a brother a break, Im just now getting over an upper respiratory viral infection), but BANG, there they were in the flavor. Moderately malty and chocolatey up front. Moderately bitter and very lightly sweet and sour on the backside... mostly sour. Chinese food anyone? Full-bodied with mild carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel. A lengthy, very dry, crisp finish. Another small burst of milk chocolate on the tail end of the finish. A little too heavily hopped for my taste regarding the style. At 69 IBUs, this is definitely a HopHeads chocolate stout. Very good beer.

I need to buy beer that's too old more often.  Lovely, lovely stuff.  Deep and dark color, with a firm, thick chocolate milk-colored head that lasts for a looooong time.  Nose is amazing--could smell the chocolate from several feet away.  Just fills the head with rich coffee, with little hints of toffee and caramel.  Flavor is lovely.  Tastes like a huge, thick chocolate malted that's had rich roasts added to it.  Was pleasantly surprised by the hoppiness of the finish.  Great mouthfeel, very reminscent of (not surprisingly) chocolate milk--it's smooth and refreshing, and thoroughly coats your mouth and tongue.  This reminds me of some sort of stout-on-stout black-and-tan combo thing, maybe a black-and-deep brown.

618,"2002-01-11",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 24, 2004 Dark black with a brown head. Rich sweet chocolate aroma.  Flavor of chocolate and roasted malt.  Long bitter dark chocolate finish.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Darkover"

618,"2001-10-29",3.1,"Sweet chocolate aroma.  Good bitter/sweet chocolate tastes.  Too much carbo.  Unbalanced, I thought that the chocolate taste was weak.","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","daboskabouter"
618,"2001-10-28",3.1,"Black; a lot of chocolate on the nose - like a creamy, well-structured cafe mocha; astringent palate though, clashing the bitterness of the dark chocolate with the roastiness of the stout.  Not a match made in heaven.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
618,"2001-10-04",4.2,"This may be the darkest beer I have ever seen. Smells like a mocha coffee. Strong chocolate malt taste. Nice bitter balance. A bit thin and fizzy on the tongue.","Canton, Michigan, USA","johnson2020"
618,"2001-10-03",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2003 Wow..black with a big creamy brown head with a nose of pure chocolate and hints of cascades. This is wonderful, palate is smooth with chocolate and  chocolate malt,some light oaty notes as well, finishes with a dose of cascades..not intense but a very plentiful amount with another trace of chocolate running down your throat, perfect bittersweet finish..Take Young's and Storm king, put them together and add more chocolate and this is what you would get......fantastic.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"

618,"2001-07-14",4.1,"Who melted godiva chocolate in my stout? Seriously, I have never had such a chocolatey beer in my life, with just the right level of sweetness.  Followed by a slightly roasted aftertaste, this could be used to convert anyone who says they dont like beer (and likes chocolate).  They wont believe this is beer.  Just a bit too bubbly for a stout, though. Unique nonetheless.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
618,"2001-07-14",4.4,"Two words, CHOCHO-LATE. This is one of the most chocolaty creations ever, very nice. I cant wait to try it again.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"
618,"2001-07-06",4.0,"This is probably the best stout made in the US. Loaded with chocolate malt and very hoppy for a stout. Balanced out very nicely with no bitter aftertaste whatsoever due to the overhopping. A meal.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"

618,"2001-02-26",4.1,"Another Rogue treat!  A complex stout with bitter and sweet flavors.  The chocolate was very apparent, but not overwhelming.  The bitterness lingers a long time after finishing.  The chocolate and malty flavors compliment each other nicely.  Note, this is a heavy brew.  I split a 22oz with a friend and I was too full to have anymore beer (and this was my first one).  So be sure to drink this on a weeknight when youre just going to have one.  Enjoy!","Acworth, Georgia, USA","billb"
618,"2001-02-21",4.0,"Bold flavor; smooth character. Velvet-like chocolate flavor glides across your tongue. If you like chocolate and you like stouts, youll love this. Strong milk chocolate flavor exudes; not burnt, but soft, sweet and smooth. A great after-dinner dessert drink. Real flavorful. Rogue rules.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
