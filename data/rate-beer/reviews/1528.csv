1528,"2016-01-14",3.3,"Draft... Pours clear and yellow with golden highlights and a small, fizzy white head. The aroma is restrained, but I am able to gather some grapefruit, tropical fruits and pale grains. An incredibly full-bodied and buttery mouthfeel for a 4.4% abv beer. Tingly carbonation. The flavor features spicy grains and medium hop bitterness. Crisp, moderately bitter, Sahara-dry finish.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1528,"2015-04-10",3.8,"Draft. Pours gold with a white head. Grassy and light fruity hops, mild bitterness, relatively clean wheaty malty base, and a quick and lightly hoppy finish. Balanced; drinkable; a clean and tasty chugger.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
1528,"2015-03-28",4.2,"Świetna pszenica, o wyjątkowo dobrym odczuciu w ustach. Super gładka, super przyjemna, super pijalna. Brakuje nieco mocniejszego aromatu citry, ale ogólnie piwo jest świetne.","Poznan, POLAND","adasko"
1528,"2015-03-22",4.1,"Poured a Kush. Lightly hazed gold, white head. A really nice hoppy wheat beer. This is good. Reminds me of the wheat IPA that my local(Fate) brews. Wheat is a nice balance to the hops in this one. And if you are in the Wynwood area, stop by Kush. Food, beer and service are top notch!","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"

1528,"2015-02-18",3.7,"Draft - Sweet Mandarin and tropical fruit. Hazy gold with a decent white head. Vanilla, pepto bismal, tropical fruit and. An ice bitterness. Doesnt sound good, but I actually quite like it.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
1528,"2014-12-30",3.8,"Poured a place or anguish yellow color with aromas of wheat, citrus and some hops. Flavors are crisp citrus and hops and light cracked wheat. Light yeast solid and enjoyable. Labeled ""BTM Wheat"" at the bar.","Florida, USA","burg326"
1528,"2014-08-30",4.2,"A pretty damn good hoppy wheat beer. Nose has a decent amount of tropical fruits, flavor is the same with mild sweetness and a ton of hop character. Flavorful, drinkable, a great summer beer. Shame the name is so fucking terrible.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
1528,"2014-06-13",3.6,"Poured from a tap. Clear golden color, large white frothy head with nice lacing. Strong floral and simco hops aroma, smells like a nice IPA over a wheat beer. Light body with a mild hop flavor and a mild finish.

1528,"2014-05-05",4.1,"Houblons astringents, résine cinglante dans une bombe aromatique à la buvabilité vigoureuse. Sans contredits la plus intéressante de la liste.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
1528,"2014-03-24",3.7,"Une dentelle collante gracieuseté dune mousse épaisse refuse de quitter le verre se remplissant dun liquide jaune paille et limpide. Les houblons dégageant des arômes dagrumes et le blé constituent le bouquet un peu floral de cette bière. Très douce en bouche, elle est toutefois très goûteuse avec son goût dagrumes et céréales sucrées. Désaltérante à souhait.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","RickTheRick"
