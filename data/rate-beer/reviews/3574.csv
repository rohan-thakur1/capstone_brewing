3574,"2017-02-18",4.0,"750 ml bottle. Pours a clear golden orange color and topped by a nice, smooth head of off white foam that quickly settles to a thin film with some solid lacing. The aroma shows notes of tart and juicy grapefruit, salinity from the salt, crisp wheat, some earthy minerals, and lactic sourness. The flavor follows with the juicy red grapefruit, some lemon, crisp wheat, earthy minerals, some lactic sourness, yogurt, and a nice saltiness on the finish. The sourness is there but not overpowering. Light in body with ample carbonation that leads to a tart, salty, and juicy grapefruit finish. Very crisp, refreshing, easy to drink and definitely crushable. Every sip dries out and begs for another. Really tasty stuff and a top notch Gose.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
3574,"2017-02-17",3.7,"Draft at Brouwerij Lane in Brooklyn. Clear golden color with a small white head. Aroma is nice grapefruit, damp earth, salt. Nicely tart, fruity, and mildly salty flavor. Medium bodied, fairly lively feel, some bite. Good.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
3574,"2017-01-31",3.8,"750ml bottled acquired via Homer321. Thanks as always, Sean. Pours a darker lightly hazed pour of gold, a kiss of ruby red glow and some dulled fall glow on the edges. Frothy whitish head atop leaves a decent film, good ringer that laces solid. Aromas are lactic, punchy, citric. A bit of salinity, earthy mineral appeal with punchy lemon and grapefruit, pithy appeal, straw and mellow bready malts. Clean, fun, a touch of lime. Initial is light bodied, salty and sour. Punchy lactic appeal is pleasant, grapefruit and lemon, a bit of straw, yogurt, some sea salt earthy salinity. Straw, wheat, a yogurty trail and punchy lactic punch. Limes, grapefruit, bitter rind, tart pithy fruit. A decent sour kick but no interfering acidity. A touch flabby on the carbonation front, but this one works pretty well as far as flavors go. Tart, sour, dry, a salty touch, citric life, mellow crushable body overall. Solid nose and pour, much more on point flavors and flow as far as its strength. Enjoyable stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
