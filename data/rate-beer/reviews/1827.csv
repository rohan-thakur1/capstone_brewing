1827,"2017-05-24",3.3,"0.65l bottle @ Hotel Room. This is a deeper brown looking one only a small quickly islandy dark beige head in the top. Smells really nice. It has a good darker roasted aroma. Acidic hints, cold dark coffee. Nice. Its really on the sweeter path this. Not cloying but not too far off either. Its mild oily in the mouth and about average on the carbonation. Sweetish coffee. Like its been added brown sugar. Traces of vanilla and cream. Ends with a throat warming flak roasted taste. The first few sips were nice, but now almost finished with the bottle Im not sure if I would want to drink more of this. 20.06.2015","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate molasses, chocolate, and espresso. It pours a dark brown with barely any orange highlights. It has a small beige head that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a slightly thicker ring. The flavor starts with moderate chocolate, molasses, and a hint of caramel. The finish has light espresso and roast. Its a medium bodied with light-moderate carbonation. Overall, its a little sweeter than I prefer.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

1827,"2015-11-14",3.5,"Pours pitch black and completely opaque with very faint mahogany edges when held to a light source. Half finger off-white head that quickly settles into a thin ring. Minimal spotty lacing left behind. 

Slightly smokey, deeply roasted dark malt aroma with a robust gourmet coffee presence thats nicely integrated without obliterating every other characteristic of the beer. Some smoked meat and charcoal along with burnt toast, fresh espresso bean and bitter dark chocolate. Theres also a subtle lactic presence along with some sweet desert-like bakers chocolate. Smells kind of like flour less chocolate cake. 

On the lower end of medium body with tight carbonation and a bitter, deeply roasted espresso/coffee bean flavor that dominates the palate. Doesnt live up to the aroma with a light mouthfeel, a bit too much carbonation and slightly one dimensional flavor profile. Dry and bitter with a slightly burnt, acrid espresso flavor with hints of smoke, charcoal, barbecued meat and burnt toast. Under all of the roast, there is some nice coffee flavor and sweeter chocolate malt notes. The high ABV is well masked but its still a bit too harsh and roasted/burnt tasting for my preference.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Taste: VERY sweet and almost syrupy, with espresso-chocolate syrup, slightly burnt black bread with honey butter, tons of blackstrap molasses and vanilla, with just a hint of mint.  Finish: fulsome with lingering chewy sweetness; the palate on this thing was a monster. Notes: A gigantic beer, but the alcohol was almost completely hidden in the palate, which was almost more like drinking an espresso milkshake as opposed to drinking a beer.

1827,"2014-04-27",4.3,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance well, all I have to say youll never see any Schwarzbier that pours a smoother jet black color than this beer, holy smoothness - pure black, awesome one finger white to off white - maybe somewhat of a tan colored head, no lacing whatsoever.
The smell had a dark and very roasty espresso up front, some light milky chocolate does come out eventually.
The taste was smooth espresso and milk chocolate flavoring that pierces the taste buds in a fine sort of way; smooth espresso aftertaste, dry espresso/chocolate finish.
On the palate, this wants to be somewhat light, but due to the ABV and the darkness of it - I wanna say it actually sits pretty ""medium"" on the mouth. I say awesome try to Midnight Sun to try to make a somewhat sessionable Schwarzbier of that ABV, but this does hit ya after a while - this beast does show its strength - dont think this is any ""kitten."" Carbonation - wow exceptionally smooth - boy oh boy, personally I dont think Ive ever tried any Schwarzbier this smooth if I ever find any Schwarzbier so smooth I will definitely seek this one just to compare.
Overall, Schwarzbier, this is a Schwarzbier (I wish someone could actually hear my tone right now), ok, Schwarzbier really? I need an emoticon in this review, but I dont know how else to say it, but this is one odd Schwarzbier to rate to style, though I absolutely love it for me as the espresso just overpowers everything else for the most part and the smoothness of a normal Schwarzbier comes out, the ABV does ""bite"" just enough to say ""go easy with this"" - its a beast in disguise that really says ""dont take me for granted.""

However, Im trying to figure out why this is labeled a ""doppelbock"" on this website. Oh well, not my problem. Its a schwarzbier which is nowhere close to a true doppelbock.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Dense Tootsie-Roll notes, caramel, and well-roasted coffee in the aroma; some pronounced, vinous alcohol as well, slightly warming. Schwarzbier is a stretch here. Medium-full body; light CO2; hefty, slightly viscous mouthfeel. A big, on-point black lager with well-integrated coffee additions (the coffee plays a role, but doesnt steal the show) along with plenty of caramel, fruity alcohol, and some darker smoky malts as a tertiary note; a bit of oxidation.

The coffee just oozes around the edges. Aspects of sweet dark fruit are stronger. Full bodied. Flavor is chocolate and espresso, with treacle and a good dose of dark fruit. Espresso vs coffee: its a strong, gritty coffee, not unlike the rough stuff I make in the morning. Which comes out of an espresso machine. This is certainly not dry. It still seems to have a lot of treacle. But it is one incredible drink. Power to the flavor. And this is a schwarzbier? Whither goest das reinheitsgebot? :)","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

1827,"2010-08-18",3.9,"Bomber.  This is probably the most intense Schwarzbier (well, Imperial Schwarz....if thats a style), that Ive ever had.  The pour is as black and dense as just about any imperial stout, shutting light out completely, and supporting a small head of steadfast mocha froth.  Minimal, spotty lacing dots the glass.  Aromas include huge notes of cafe mocha roast, sweet dark chocolate, stewed raisins, and a bit of earthy, smoky molasses.  It smells like it is quite nicely balanced between the bitter roast and the choco-caramel sweetness, and it even throws a little curveball with a hint of spicy red pepper flake.  Flavors are deliciously chocolaty and fruity, almost like black sapote (pudding fruit), with secondary notes of caramel-mocha, coffee roast, and molasses.  Mmmm mmmm good.  The palate doesnt disappoint, delivering the malty, roasty depths with surprisingly ample substance, a smooth consistency, and a mildly sticky finish.  This is some tasty stuff.  Im surprised more brewers havent attempted monster black lagers like this, as popular as imperial stouts have become.  Very nice beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

1827,"2009-08-23",3.4,"Pours a thick dark black with a tan head. Strong coffee aroma with slight notes of caramel/toffee maltyness. Taste is big bold coffee. The beer is smooth and creamy. Easy to drink for a big coffee beer. The name says it all.","Anchorage/ Vista,CA, Alaska, USA","Aggy360"
1827,"2009-07-30",3.5,"Impervious ebony. Creamy beige froth holds extremely well. Smoky, raisiny, espresso-laden aromas with charcoal,  alcohol-steeped prunes and dabs of scorched custard. Soft carbonic prickles wash over the tongue. Bottle conditioned. Full-bodied. Explosively rich, round and sugary with a viscous fudge-drenched espresso bean and mashed plum foundation. Espresso is slightly gritty and vegetal, though the moderate smokiness compensates nicely. Clean peppery alcohol generates a mild scratch as it stings the palate before fusing with the snug metallic-tinged espresso tingle which disperses the tacky residual sugars. Resoundingly soft, succulent, and sweetly portlike in the ester department, though it does teeter on medicinal at times as the molasses twang compounds the potent cassis and overripe plum tandem. Relentless, tongue-numbing espresso sufficiently staves off the flabbiness, however, as it continually deposits smoky- and tar-rich underpinnings. Finishes with a sublime sweet and sour fusion of dark fruits, black licorice and espresso-drenched chocolate wafers cleansed by a late surge of brisk alcohol.  Midnight Sun claims this is a lager, and if this is true, it is undoubtedly the fruitiest lager Ive ever encountered. Not exactly a whole lot of character to this,  kinda kitchen-sinkish in some ways, and fairly muddled/poorly structured/boozy as a result. But lots of complexity. Not bad.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1827,"2009-07-24",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2009 22 oz bottle. Pitch black with a tan head. Massive aroma of coffee, roasted grain, caramel, smoke and alcohol. The flavor is big and sweet with a bitterness that comes from the coffee and roasted grain. Full body with a thick creamy mouth feel and a mild carbonation. As this warmed up the coffee and roasty flavors really came out, the alcohol aroma came out more as well.","Anchorage, Alaska, USA","savnac"
1827,"2009-07-22",3.8,"22 oz bottle.  Dark brown with a foamy tan head.  Nose is malted milk balls, espresso beans, light grass and some caramel.  Rich and creamy with buzzy carb and an alcohol kick.  Taste is prunes, molasses, tobacco and Greek coffee.  A impressive melange of massive flavors.  Lingering coffee and vodka with an odd vegetal note, maybe chard.  Could be great with some aging.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"

1827,"2009-06-07",4.1,"Sampled during Deliriumfests Graduation tasting at Heritage Liquors in Maplewood, MN. Shared by Deliriumfest. Pours an opaque dark brown colored brew with a thick beige head that slowly dissipates to a thin beige ring. Aroma of strong coffee grounds, toasted dark malt, a hint of tangerine and chocolate. Taste is full bodied, very little carbonation with flavors of toasted dark malt, coffee, a hint of chocolate and caramel . Finish has a sharp bittern bite with some alcohol warmth with a lingering coffee and chocolate aftertaste. Nice.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"

1827,"2009-05-13",4.2,"Tenth rating of this bad boy, lets lock it in!  I had the chance to be right in the front of the line when this finally got tapped at FredFest 09.  Pour a clear but very dark black with a decent light tan head.  Raising this one to my nose I got just kicked with deep rich coffee, and not they sweet crappy smelling coffee in many beers that utilize beans.  Coffee again just stands out as I sip on this one, but I do pick up some hints of some malt and chocolate.  I cant say as though I have had another Schwarzbier that tasted like this and I would also say this is the best use of coffee in any beer I have had.  More please!","Washington, USA","bvc"

Appearance: Black in color, Clear with a thin head.  
Flavor: This was one of the best beers in years.  The flavor was huge and the smoke and coffee where thick and smooth.  
Palate: Dry coffee/smokey finish, with a Good Mouthfeel.  
Overall: I loved this beer I will seek this and drink many more time in my life.  AWESOME.","Olympia, Washington, USA","BrewDad"
1827,"2009-05-10",4.2,"Draft at Fredfest 09 at Hair of the Dog. Gorgeous deep black with rubied ebony highlights in the corners. Burnt tan, fizzy head that falls quickly away to not much. Humongous coffee nose, rich and bright and acidic, carrying over some roasty malt. Luscious medium creamy body, soft carb, plenty of thickness to it but not sticky or overwhelming (beautifully balanced yeast). Coffee swirls against a great malt base, hops stay out of the way, and a nice sweet coffee classic is born. For you coffee-bomb lovers, this should be a new standard.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
1827,"2009-04-26",4.0,"Bottle sample at local BA gathering.

Poured a dark brown color with an average frothy brown head that was mostly lasting and produced excellent lacing. Moderate roasted malt, bread and alcohol aroma. Medium body with a dry smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy roasted dark cofee flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish of moderate to long duration.

Solid standout brew and very good for style.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1827,"2009-04-25",4.2,"Big thanks to Ira for this bomber, poured into a tulip.

This one comes out of the bottles dark brown but looks pretty close to black in the glass. The head is big and tan, receding fairly quickly and leaving decent lacing.

The aroma is massive with the roasted espresso dominating from start to finish. There are hints of sweet malts in the background, but honestly its all about the espresso.

The taste dials back the espresso just a bit. Its still there but there is a lot more sweetness than the aroma would suggest. Plenty of sweet malts forming a backbone with some chocolate sweetness and even a bit of molasses in the finish balancing the espresso bitterness.

The mouthfeel is on the fuller side of things for the style and thick on the palate with soft carbonation just coating the mouth completely.

Honestly, this one really blew me away. Its certainly the most original and probably the best schwarzbier Ive had.  Just another great beer from Midnight Sun and Im really excited about the new series.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
1827,"2009-04-12",3.9,"Got to sample a bottle of this courtesy of, ""AKfaust"". Colour... DARK brown with essentially no head. Nose.... Yowza! Did someone lock me in the coffee roaster at Kaladi Bros.?! Palate... lots of coffee up front and plenty of roasty malt. Not much hop bitterness, but thats OK, the coffee makes up for it. Nice long finish thats reminiscent of an Americano with a dab of milk. Mmmmm... mmmm!","Portland, Oregon, USA","neepsntatties"
1827,"2009-03-21",3.8,"Bottle pours black with tan head that dissipates quickly.  Aroma is mainly strong dark coffee.  Some roasted malt shine through a little, but mainly coffee.  Medium-thin mouthfeel with a lot of carbonation.  The high carbonation makes this a somewhat sharp or bitter brew on the finish.  A bit spicy.  Flavor was strong coffee, roasted malt, and again finished on the bitter side.  A solid brew.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","fiver29"
1827,"2009-03-20",3.4,"i dig it. though its not the most ideal shwarz the originality that went into crafting this brew sold me enough to buy it again. on the second take i can say my appreciation has increased since my first go.  the color is the slightest bit translucent with a starkly coffee color and thin millet head.  the appearance is magnified by the nose, which to an unsuspecting passerby could be perceived to be pure espresso, yet the malty notes and caramel flush with bitter chocolate are there if only disguised slightly.  The effect on the palate is equivalent, masking any semblance of alcohol or its true ingredients with bitter, roasted colombian bean taking the forefront and maintaining an unrelenting stance.  this beer is enjoyable though many of its enjoyable qualities come from the fact that it is more coffee than beer and it will get you feeling a bit silly after 22 oz. or so.  Well balanced and not too overwhelming any coffee drinker looking for a fun, tasty breakfast brew will find solace in this crew brew from midnight sun (whose brewery is located exactly 200 yards from my apartment so i might be a tad partial).  good job jeremiah, I look forward to the next installment of this series.","Anchorage, Alaska, USA","chuck316"
1827,"2009-02-26",3.8,"Wow...big coffee aroma...nice on the nose though..triple shot espresso please. Dark nut brown in color with a very nicely balanced coffee/malt flavor, surprising easy on the palate considering how much coffee must have went into this thing.
