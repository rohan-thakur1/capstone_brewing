268,"2017-03-08",1.3,"Nice flowery sweet aroma. Wow this is not enjoyable. Just a very strong grain alcohol flavor. All the flavor of Everclear with a fraction of the punch. Ick. As I force myself to drink it gets a little better but not much","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
268,"2016-10-12",3.3,"Bottle at home always figured reasonable prices sake bottles would run dry but keep finding new ones. Not prettiest pour of oily yellow. Nose is rice and light melon. Tastes of honey dew, vanilla, rice water, walnuts some peppery tones. Alcohol hidden well and palate is spot on with creamy texture.","New York, USA","Jow"
268,"2013-07-23",3.3,"Nose is creamy, sweet with vanilla.  
Crystal clear.

Simple, medium, clean. Melon, vanilla, with a little fennel and green tea,  then the back palate is similar but creamier and introduces a slight acidity.  Finishes slightly harsh with almond, earth, citrus rind and alcohol.","California, USA","mixmaster"
268,"2013-02-16",3.6,"Stylish bottle caught my attention and im glad it did. Aroma is melon and sweet rice. Palate is medium. There is just enough thickness to it to complement the sweet/balanced creaminess of the flavor, which matches the nose with melon and lightly sweet rice. Not a lot of complexity, but tasty, especially for the price. I could drink this regularly.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","Inebelation"
268,"2011-06-29",3.2,"bottle thanks to mora2000.  poured clear with decent legs.  marzipan, fruits, florals, and light alcohol.  very light on the palate, fruits, vanilla, light florals, and no sign of alcohol.","Dallas, Texas, USA","mar"
268,"2011-04-24",2.9,"(300ml bottle thanks to Mora2000) clear, still with no coating or legs. Nose of maple, caramel and honey. Taste of alcohol, melon, and caramel. Thin body with an alcoholic finish.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
268,"2011-02-06",3.2,"Sampled at Japanese Pavilion at Epcot. Pours clear. Dry, grainy aroma with a touch of melon. Taste is very dry with rice, vanilla and melon all popping up.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
268,"2011-01-25",3.2,"bottle, thanks to mora2000, clear pour with aroma of rice, coconut milk, flavor is a mix of paste and fruit cocktail","Dallas, Texas, USA","blutt59"
268,"2011-01-06",3.1,"(300ml bottle, courtesy of Mora2000)  Pours a transparent body.  Aroma of vanilla, melon, and rice milk.  Flavor of vanilla, almond, and light florals.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
268,"2010-12-28",3.2,"Clear. Aroma is rice and alcohol with not too much else going on. The flavor is more complex. I get some rice and some alcohol, but I also get some melon and vanilla notes. Pretty good.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
268,"2010-12-28",2.7,"Bottle courtesy mora2000. Very clear. No color at all or carbonation. Aroma is slightly sweet and ricey. Paper pulp nose also. Flavor is slightly sweet with rice and big alcohol sting. Finishes with cardboard and harsh tingles.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"
268,"2009-09-20",2.6,"Bottle. No head. Colorless. Aroma is notes of glue, melon rind, mold, alcohol. Flavor is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic. Light to medium body, creamy/watery texture, flat carbonation. Not much to recommend, pretty straightforward.  Mouthfeel is somewhat silky, probably its best feature. Sweet and mild.  Bought this to cook with, based on the price and small bottle size ( 300 mL ), and got pretty much what I expected...not bilge water but not something Id drink either.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
268,"2008-03-30",3.5,"Thanks to ilovedarkbeer for this nice one. Clear body with strong legs left on the glass. Aroma of rice and wrotten pineapple. Tastee is sweet, but a bit watery at 14.5% and a little watery. Kind of a buttery mouthfeel. Very smooth drinking.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
268,"2008-03-29",3.6,"Pours a pale yellow color that is brilliant and clear. Super smooth, to the point of being like sugar water. I was amazed by the smoothness. Notice the acidity levels in the description, anyone who does not give this beer a 4 or 5 on palate is a fool. Taste is sweet, dry, a bit fruity and very ricey. I liked this one but was not super impressed in the taste department.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
268,"2006-05-16",3.1,"300mL Bottle: Clear color, nose is sweet with light koji and grainy notes, a bit of alcohol. The flavor is nutty and a bit acidic and harsh but not completely bad. Moderate alcohol, harsh koji and a noticed lack of fruity melon characteristics and a buttery mouthfeel. Decent, but not that great. the line between the two is large.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
268,"2004-04-27",3.5,"Quite drinkable, and my favorite sake of about 4 tried so far. Quite like the unpasteurized one I had, this is delightfully sweet (walnut nut meat) and flowery. Very drinkable. The aroma components I just plain old can't get to (too much alcohol) but that alcohol presence is really barely detectable in the flavor. Yes!","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
