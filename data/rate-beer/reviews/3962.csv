3962,"2017-03-21",3.9,"Pours a gorgeous deep black underneath a giant beige head leaving tons of lace. Nose is citrus-mocha, roasted and fruity with a notable hoppy back. Taste walks the line between hoppy porter and black IPA (as do most entrants in the style), with a huge roasted malt base topped by loads of citric-pine hop madness. Mild sweetness gets quickly overrun by the massive waves of resinous, clingy hop vitriol. Good but a bit abrasive. (5/2011)","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"
3962,"2016-11-02",2.0,"this review is for a 2013 model, so more than 3 years old. didnt expect much since Ive had it fresh and its amazing. but found this and gave it a shot. - pours opaque brown with minimal crema-like colored thin head. on the nose, dates, plums, stale wet cardboard, some umami and soy sauce. not good.
taste is muted roasted malts, toffee, molasses with off-flavors of wet cardboard. bitterness is still prominent but in a very harsh way. mouth feel is medium full, with medium carbonation and oily, rich texture. the aftertaste is a lingering bitter harshness. -","Miami, Florida, USA","Rumbero"
3962,"2016-10-13",3.2,"Bottle into tulip. Black w decent head. Strong resinous hop aroma and taste. Some muting of the hop by the dark malt but still unmistakably an IPA. I am not a huge hop fan but thought to give it a whirl. I Will not go back to it any time soon as too hoppy but can see why hop heads like it.

3962,"2016-09-22",3.9,"A dense, unwavering dark pour that holds up a brightly sandy head. Beautiful. Notes of roasted coffee and chocolate waft from a distance. A closer nose reveals the amazing tropical citrus, mango, papaya, and floral lemon. The flavor starts round and robustly dark, medium plus body, chocolate and light roast coffee, all surrendering to a floral, lemon, tangerine and lifted pine. The floral, rindy, and dark chocolate linger echo beyond the sip. Ive had this one fresh, and Ive had this one not-so-fresh. Both have been great.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","mambossa"

Palate is medium-to-full bodied, with airy/foamy texture, lively carbonation and mix of sweet and bitter roasted finish.

Aroma is some trademark Stone resin, but a lot of dark somewhat musty malt too - like the Brewcraft shop almost. Perhaps a bit off.

Disappointed, of course, but then I actually found a bottle - in the cellar of my late friends broher-in-law. He graciously accepted to share it with me.

3962,"2016-02-26",3.9,"Well, this is fairly ridiculous. I thought I was looking this up to reminisce about this beer and see what I said about it, but apparently I never got around to rating it! Im enjoying my last bottle of it since it is now gone forever (but replaced by Enjoy By Black IPA which is also excellent). This was a great early beer by Stone and Im guessing they may do a ""Encore Performance"" run of it some day like theyre doing for others. Anyway, nice roasted malt aroma with lots of hoppyness coming out of a very dark brown but crystal clear body with a light tan head. Dark chocolate and cocoa up front with biting astringency following this which I think is both the hops and the alcohol working together. Earthy and citrusy, the hops really round out the dark roasted husky malt. Ends with more chocolate and cocoa on the tongue with a lasting bitter burn in the back. Farewell you sublimely self-righteous bastard, you will be missed and remembered.","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"

Aroma is a violent clash between toasted malt, and floral piney hops.

Unreal hoppy black beauty.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","bulldogops"

Piny, tobacco, slight strawberry, licorice, black currants. Taste suffers surprisingly little from the ageing. Sweet, malty, piny and grassy up front, bitter roasted and hoppy finish.

3962,"2015-09-24",3.7,"From notes. Enjoyed on September 19 at Travis house. Poured from a 22 oz bottle labeled as Stone 11th Anniversary that was produced in 2007. Should be interesting. The pour is great. Its a dark brown with some ruby or garnet shining through and a couple fingers of an off white head that leaves some decently soapy lace. The aroma is definitely oxidized up front. There is some leather, and a little bland old hoppiness. There is a good roast present, and a light bitterness that is sure to have faded over time. I would have liked to try this fresh, but I suppose I can go buy a Sublimely Self Righteous if I feel the need. The flavor is more oxidized. There is a little hoppiness, and maybe some decent roast, but this one had just blended together into a roasty, oxidized fluid with a hint of bitterness. Its disappointing. The mouth feel is thin and light with an off carbonation and a lingeringly roasted, oxidized finish. Might need to get a Sublimely...","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Taste is bitter as an IPA should be but it is difficult to tell if this bitterness is coming from hops or from burnt roastiness. I guess they fit together almost perfectly. Body is there but not too much or not too little. There is burnt rye, hops by the basket, dark fruits and finish is actually quite short and leaves some burnt rye bread taste to linger for a while. Alcohol should be significant - it has after all 8,7% - but is almost not noticeable. This is very very nice, too bad that Stone has decided to discontinue this beer.","ESTONIA","jinroh"

3962,"2014-10-12",4.3,"Transfer from BA review on 3-18-14-

 Poured from bottle into a snifter

 Appearance  The beer pours a very deep brown color bordering on black with a one finger of tan colored head. The head has a fantastic level of retention, slowly fading to leave a great level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma of the beer is big and robust of some nice hoppy and roasted smells. There are lots of roasted malt smell as well as some other darker aromas of a bit of coffee. Along with the darker aromas is a great dose of hop, with a grapefruit hop aroma the heaviest, but being accompanied by some nice pine and earthy hop smells as well. Rounding out the smell is just some hints of sweeter aromas with some light orange smells as a hint of molasses.

 Taste  The taste starts with a rather roasty malt flavor with some coffee and a bit of a caramel sweetness. An earthy and pine hop flavor are present right from the start, beginning the taste with a rather decent hop flavor. As the taste advances, the hop grows more and more intense with the lighter level of caramel sweetness that was also present right at the start of the flavor fading a bit. A bit of a grapefruit hop flavor grows on the tongue as the flavor advances, but the biggest hop flavor increase comes with the pine flavors as they really grow quite potent toward the end of the taste. Along with the increase in the hop, the roasted flavors grow stronger as well as growing a bit grainier and burnt in nature. With the mix of roasted flavors and the rather big pine and other hop flavors, one is left with a rather robust, darkly hopped flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and chewier side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. Both are very nice for the mix of pine hop and darker flavors and make for a great sipping, but still very drinkable dark IPA.

 Overall  A rather tasty and moderately stronger black IPA. It had a nice blend of big pine hop flavors and roasted malt that would leave one craving either of these flavors (if not both) rather satisfied.","","Darkmagus82"

3962,"2014-07-22",3.6,"Reviewed from notes. 
This was poured into a pint glass and a tulip. There was barely any difference between the two glasses. 
The appearance was a black color with a one finger white to off white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute leaving some light lacing sliding into the beer. 
The smell had a nice roasty bitter coffee to sweet citrusy pine aroma with a rolling light chocolate underneath. 
The taste was sweet citrus to roasty and had the chocolate only come out really underneath. 
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat sharp but not overbearing.
Overall, I say this was a pretty good black IPA Id have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3962,"2014-07-20",4.0,"Pours obsidian with a creamy tan head; the appearance and aromas foreshadow the richness and depth to come.

Sweet hoppy notes on the nose with molasses, roasted coffee, and burnt sugar. The aroma almost makes me think of an IPA mating with a Barleywine ale. 

This is a strong one which has deep bitterness that hangs on a bit. It's a black IPA that is better than most. 

This beer doesn't want to be too cold. About 55d-60d seems ideal.

3962,"2014-07-18",4.5,"The body has an opaque dark black color with a thick light tan head on top. The head is long lasting and makes for tons of cool lacing on the glass. The aroma has solid roasted and toasted maltiness with caramel like sweetness backed up by equally solid citrusy hops. Its deep maltiness sets up a firm base for the hops to work there bitter magic. From the base malt I get firm toasted and roasted character with loads of caramel like sweetness that weaves in and out of the dominate hops. The hops bring a big hit of citrus and pine like bitterness. Notes of grapefruit, lime, bitter orange and pine resin hang onto the tongue long into the slow fading finish. The big full body brings a heavy slow sipping and sticky texture with just enough carbonation to keep things from getting cloying.","New York, USA","generallee08"

3962,"2014-03-25",4.3,"$6 bottle from Three Blind Mice in Mt. Clemens, Michigan. Enjoy By date was a week ago at most, but thats not enough to make me whine to the waitress or owner.

Appearance: Opaque black, it seems. Nice tan sort of head on top with fantastic sip-by-sip lacing for the most part.

Smell: A bit of char, but definitely piled with hops... definitely a black IPA on the nose. No fruitiness that I can tell, just earthy, piney hops and some roast.

Taste/feel: The piney/earthy hops are definitely there, but some sort of citrus is in the flavor that I didnt get in the aroma. The hops dominate at the forefront, with a roast/char aftertaste. A nice body on this one as well, with a carbonation thats maybe medium-high.

Later on, a slight mildew aroma hits the nose as well as a melon-like sweetness. It pours a dark opaque red-brown (caramel?) color - maybe more brown than red - with a cloudy head that leaves an alright lacing. Its highly bitter with a mellow, medium sweetness coming through as a secondary note on the tongue. The full bodied beer hits the palate with a very burnt toast start that mellows into some mild dark fruits (I want to say currants). Theres a soft, but abundant carbonation that has this leaning towards creaminess (not quite) but definitely slick. The burnt notes linger throughout the swallow, finishing with dark, dried fruits.

Bb: 8/10/11 (bottled 5/10/11)

A: Pours a dark maduro ale with a single finger of latte head which dissipates to a quilt of the same. Excellent clarity albeit difficult to assess given the malt profile. Spotty lacing.

S: Wowzy! Lots of hops! This is the most hoppy of the ABAs Ive had. Plenty of pine, citrus rinds, hints of resin, grapefruit. Malts are there, but subdued. Lets hope that isnt the case in my mouth.

T: Bitter, from malts and hops; hard to say which. plenty of Black malty goodness interwoven with a solid west-coast hoppyness. Hints of dark chocolate on the far back end. Really a pleasant beer.

M: More viscous than many Ive had in the style, and in a good way. The feel is velvety and low in carbonation allowing for optimal flavor resonance and punctuation. 

O: I can see why this one is among the best. Not my favorite ABA, but I would argue better crafted than my favorite ABA (mad River Serious Madness). This one is easily had, year around, has the best body Ive had in the style, and comes from a reputable brewery with their eyes on QA.

Big piney hops with citrus, pineapple, mango, earthy dark roast with caramel, coffee. Taste is unique, burnt sugar, coffee plus a hop wallop and bitterness. The sweetness of the pineapple and caramel and bitterness of the coffee and hops play off each other very well. As it warms I am getting a chocolate note as well. Very hop forward but the subtle notes that make up the malt are not lost. Mouthfeel is medium, slightly viscous, smooth carbonation.

3962,"2013-11-03",4.5,"FROM NOTES: July 22, 12
Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into stone glassware. 

A: A very bold hoppiness dominates, but the sweet malts are there in the nose as well.. Nice citrus smell (grapefruit). Chocolate presence and maybe some very faint coffee flavors. 
A: Pours almost black, just barely opaque, with a creamy, thick, tan three-fingered head that slowly dissipates, leaving a very substantial cap and sticky lacing. They dont look much better than this!
T: A beautiful blend of the roasty, chocolate porter-type flavors with the aggressively hopped IPA. Ive tasted a LOT of American Black Ales and while they all strive to reach this delicate balance, few do it as well as Sublimely Self-Righteous. Initially, there is a porter-like taste, but the hoppier citrus flavors blend in and dominate the finish. The roast and chocolate flavors show up sublimely in the aftertaste. 
P: Medium leaning towards the thicker side with a bit creaminess with the hoppy aftertaste. Great carbonation with subtle warming notes of the alcohol. 
O: I am in love with this beer, it is the best Black I have had to date. I am so moved by it that I am on the verge of becoming a full-on fanboi of Stone!","New Jersey, USA","ClassyBeagle"
3962,"2013-11-02",3.6,"Pours boot black with a very thick fluffy light tan head. Some lacing. Aroma is pine, citrus, biscuity - intriguing and quite nice.

3962,"2013-09-05",4.2,"Pours a beautiful black walnut color with just a bit of a lighter hue that comes through at the bottom and around the edges. The foam is the color of light brown sugar. Sits atop this dark body like a cloud and falls slowly to a cap and ring with a film on top. Laces well and constantly refreshes. 

Nose is out of this world. Its citrus. Grapefruit and pineapple. Some pine and a faint oniony quality. On the nose the malt is just nicely toasted with a good helping of brown sugar. It smells big and beautiful. 

Taste follows the nose to perfection. The malt is burnt and toasted, roasted goodness. Smooth and flowing underneath all that hop character. The pineapple is sweet, the grapefruit is tart. Theres some orange and some tangerine; pith and all to go with the pine. The onion quality is not bothersome on the nose nor in the drink. The malt is a little nutty and deeply sweet to hold up a very enormous bitter. The pine is sticky with resin and the bitter is dry. Floral hops are everywhere in this beer. 

Stone has really outdone itself if you ask me. This is one great beer that brings together dark malt with a bit of bitter of its own from the burnt and charred qualities and its signature hop bitter. This was fruity and tremendously sweet.

The spot on grapefruit and floral hop flavors (hibiscus and lavender?) wash over the tongue. The coffee and bittersweet chocolate follow in nice balance. This is a substantial but approachable ale. The 8.7 ABV is hidden very well in the taste. The bitterness of the hops lingers pleasantly after the swallow and the underlying citrus is quite tasty. With all the flavors going on this is sublimely balanced. I think I would love this with like a beef stew or a roast beef with a horseradish sauce.

S - Resinous pine surrounded by grapefruit zest and sweet tropical fruit. Perfume-like alcohol vapors, hits of roasted dark malts and cocoa.

T - Oily piney hop juice all the way to the middle then instantly turns to aggressive grapefruit pith, tropical fruits, and mint. All the while the roasted, almost burnt malt holds on and adds some smoky sweetness. Bitter fruit and slightly sweet with burnt chocolate on the finish. Aftertaste seems different with every drink but grapefruit seems to dominate.

M - Full bodied, very rich and creamy, moderate carbonation hops coat the mouth with bitterness.

A multitude of hop flavors with good black malts behind it. This is on the edge of being unbalanced on the hops side but the malt comes through just enough.

Mouthfeel is between medium and full-bodied - very nice. 
The taste follows the nose fairly well, but here, the hops are clearer though, which is nice but its not a hop monster. Roasted malts, coffee, dark and sweet chocolate, and a slight touch of the alcohol and earthy notes. In the aftertaste you get a nice bitterness that I suppose is from the hops.

3962,"2013-01-07",3.9,"Poured into a pint glass out of a 22oz bomber.

Pours a nearly opaque dark reddish-brown with a one finger tan head. Despite the smallish head there is outstanding head retention and nearly a solid wall of lace all the way around.

Aroma punches hard with pine resin and some tree bark. There is also a slight influence from tropical fruit but it is far behind the pine. There is a pleasant malt base with dark caramel, toast, and just a slight hint of coffee.

Tons of hops upon tasting. Pine mixed with a little bit of orange and lemon really dominates hardly letting any malt flavor through at all. Some sweet caramel along with dark toast and a faint hint of cocoa. Not nearly as much roast as I would expect given the dark color. The dark malt really shows more in the sweeter, heavier mouthfeel than in roastyness. Very bitter along with a full, somewhat sticky mouthfeel.

3962,"2012-11-29",3.4,"August 14th, 2011 - I love Stones commercial descriptions. They were my model for beer reviews when I first started writing them, and they still entertain me today. Some breweries take themselves too seriously, but Stone obviously doesnt, and they have a small empire with which they could be very serious about. As for the Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale - it is the synthesis of the dreams of black IPA fans, moon shine distillers and alcoholics. This is, by far, the booziest black IPA Ive ever had. And thats not a bad thing. With its dark mahogany glow it practically growls with alcohol induced rage, and its scent is boozy, with a dry, old wood aroma and a cranberry dryness and bitterness. The taste is no less forgiving, with its dark, musty dryness, a sharp edge, considerable graininess and maltiness, and not too much in the way of residual sugars to lighten the load. THe bulk of this beers sharp anger is strictly on you, the drinker, which makes this tough and intense drinking.

3962,"2012-11-06",4.3,"I always tend to associate piney hops with the East Coast and citrusy hops with the West. So its really surprising that Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale is one of the pineyist beers Ive ever considering this brewery is the king of the left coast. Its a nice change of pace coming from them and its a delicious beer to boot.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Opaque black body with a large, khaki colored, creamy head which is slow to dissipate and leaves gorgeous lacing on the glass.

Smell: Strong pine needle aroma with a subtle coffee scent. Some sweet orange juice concentrate as well.

Taste: Its been a while since I had an IPA that really accentuated the piney hops, so Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale really caught me off guard. As soon as it hits the tongue theres intense bitterness that only increases as the swig follows through. Light and rustic at first like pine needles which gives way to a richer, stickier, bittersweet flavor of pine sap and a hint of dark chocolate. The ending is just like the beginning with even more sharp dry bitterness that lingers on the tip of the tongue and leaves a dry aftertaste. 

This is definitely the kind of uber-hoppy brew you expect from Stone. It doesnt let your palate rest, thats for sure. Though not very complex this palate never grows old. The only flaw, if I had to find one, is that it drinks so much like a regular IPA I almost forget its a black IPA. Though there are subtle coffee and dark chocolate flavors theyre not as overt as most brews of the style. 

Drinkability: This is definitely not a beer for beginners. Between the intense bitterness and robust palate its not something you simply gulp down. Though the mouthfeel is comfortable with a slightly creamy texture, it still has a strong presence. The hops definitely linger so this isnt a refreshing beer, though it would stand up to hearty meals well. At 8.7% ABV Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale is actually light on its toes as it has no alcohol presence in the palate and doesnt go straight to your head, either.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

3962,"2012-08-25",3.1,"Bout time I review this, Ive been glossing it over for a few months now, and I hope this is as killer as the 15th anniversary ale Stone did. 22 oz. bottle poured into a tumbler pint glass.

A: Pours a very dark brown color with faint hints of light coming through the body. The head is a two finger light mocha color with a great creamy texture and excellent retention. Nice rings of lacing are left on the glass.

S: Grapefruity. Im a little disappointed Im not getting more roast/coffee/chocolate - in fact, it smells mostly like a generic IPA, not just from the citrus rind/pine/herbal hop tones, but honestly a bit from the malt backbone, as well. It smells more bright than roasted, although theres a faint hint of chocolate to remind me its still a black IPA. Dont get me wrong, I really like how it smells, but I want a little more black and a little less IPA. Then again, I thought the exact same about Storm King, and I absolutely loved that one...

T: This is really drinking like a normal IPA to me, sadly...initial flavors are strong in grapefruit and orange rind, before giving way to a medium finishing bitterness. However, the hop profile is very well executed. Chocolate malt starts to make its appearance after several sips, helping smooth out the hops and providing a burnt, ashy (even vegetal, at times) edge to the finish. Still, it doesnt mesh together in the way Stones 15th does, and it becomes slightly too boozy as it warms up - drink this one cold, in other words.

M: Rather thin, with a dryness coming more from the hops rather than the roast. Theres a bit of malt stickiness throughout. Alcohol can be felt slightly on the tongue and stomach once it warms up, and it just feels weird all around. Drinkability is disappointingly low.

O: Im really disappointed its only okay instead of mindblowing like its (sorely missed) big brother. Im thinking maybe oldish bottle, but the Stone 15th I had was 6 months old, and it still blew me away. To be fair, that was clearly more malt driven - so Ill try this again fresh, or maybe on tap.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Both have of tastes of roast, chocolate, and coffee, but again the aged is very barleywine-esque with flavors of, raisins, fig, and a light bitter finish. Fresh there are flavors of juicy hops, grapefruit, pine, big roast, and a moderately bitter finish. Also, alcohol is much more present in the aged bottle, but it held up really well. The body has really thinned out with age, but the Sublimely has a creamy texture with soft carbonation. I am basing my rating on the fresh version which is a well-crafted IPA, but the aged Anniversary ale is delicious in its own right, like a roasty American Barleywine. Very interesting comparison and a job well-done by Stone. Cheers!","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"

Its almost a little intimidating. Theres a great dark beige head that towers at three fingers. The bubbles are massive and they stick around forever. Looks great in the glass.

Smell: The hop profile is strong on top but this beer has got secrets. Theres caramel, malt and a smooth breadiness that are lying just under the surface, playing over a strong smoke scent. Stone really knows how to make some aromatic beers and Self-Righteous teases the nose with the best of them. 

Mouthfeel: Rich. Theres a refreshing, crisp quality here that still manages to be creamy.

Taste: Hops hit first and refresh more than anything. I was expecting a much more bitter hop expression and while theres bitterness here, its just smooth and clean. The tartness of them help hold the beer together. Lots of grapefruit and tangerine. A bit of lime is hiding in there too. As it passes the center of the mouth, the caramel, malt and smoke steal the show. Really, really well balanced. As it warms, I start to sense a coffee flavor. The beer ends as refreshingly as it began with a tart hop profile. Very enjoyable.

Dark brown with a 2 inch tan head that recedes to an inch and is foamy. Lacing is sticky. Aroma is toasted barley, citrus, coffee, and light floral notes. Taste is of toasted barley and light bittersweet chocolate. Orange peel, lemon, and strong citrus is there too. There is a bitterness that is dark coffee mixed with grapefruit. This beer is a malt and hop bomb. Mouthfeel is medium and a slight bitterness lingers. This is only my second BIPA but I think it will be one to judge others against.

3962,"2012-03-25",2.9,"Poured into a snifter. I admit Im not a fan of Black IPAs, but I figured Id give this one a go anyway.

3.5 A: Black color. Two fingers of frothy tan head. Retention is average for style and plenty of lacing is left.

4.0 S: Pleasant marriage of citrusy hops and roastiness. The two seem to get along better in this than in morst BIPAs. Lots of orange with pine and grapefruit in the background. Roastiness without muc chocolate or caramel.

3.0 T: The taste doesnt work too well though. Citrus with roasty burntness simply isnt a tasty combination. At least this isnt overly bitter like a lot of the style. Roasty foremost, orange and grapefruit second, and pine and char last. 

3.0 M: Lighter medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Lacking the creaminess that most BIPAs seem to have. 

3.0 D: Average for a below average style.

Serving type: bottle

3962,"2012-03-14",4.0,"0.65l bottle from myBrewerytap. I really like the these bombers from Stone. Much for the design on the bottle, and the long and always interesting text written on them, but mostly for the content. This one pours a deep dark dark brown body with a massive almost fluffy everlasting chocolate head. Lovely hoppy on the aroma, but also subtle roasted tones with chocolate, licorice, espresso powder and a hint of mint (hehe). Surprisingly low on the carbonation this. Almost flat, but I think that suits the somewhat thick and oily texture. Oh, yeah. Its a India Black Ale alright; Tons of grassy hops blended with chocolaty malts, licorice and hints of cold coffee. Reminds me a bit of mineral water - like so many IBAs often do. Ends with a hint of bitter-burned coffee beans that goes and for ever and ever.

3962,"2012-02-23",3.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 5/9/2010.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass. 

This pours a dark mahogany with a cherry tint, with a rocky light brown head. A thin film cap remains the entire time, with some sticky lace as well.

Typical Stone punch-in-the-nose strength. Strong grapefruit hops, with a distinct pine notes as well. 

Taste: A little bit unbalanced for me. I always expect monster hops with Stone brews, but a little more balance would do this one good. It starts off bitter, but black malt, roast coffee, and dark fruit have a subtle presence, before a citrus hop bite sinks in. A bitter pine finish. 

Creamy, medium carbonation wrapped in a nice full body. Alcohol is not present in the taste, but warms on the way down. 

The feel of this beer is great and helps make it evaporate, but this is a bit hop-heavy and does not really have any distinguishing characteristics over Arrogant Bastard or other strong ales for me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"
3962,"2012-02-23",3.5,"Been looking for this ale for sometime after seeing it on their site. First reaction was that it had a great head on the beer. After tasting it was really strong with the taste. Heavy on the hops and even deeper in complexity. Obviously not something I would drink to much without a steak or dinner. This is to me is a meal beer. Something on its own would really be to powerful for the average drinker thats used to lighter beers.","Santa Maria, California, USA","Achilleos"
3962,"2012-02-22",4.5,"1 Pt. 6 Fl. Oz. bottle purchased from Ale Yeah! in Decatur, Georgia. 

Ar - Immediately bombards you with a nose full of citrusy-piney hops. This is followed by a brilliant sweet, malty caramel and chocolate smell. For me, after a while the chocolate smell really starts to come through. 
Ap - Exactly what I would want a Black IPA or, as I prefer, Cascadian Dark Ale to look like. Thick and dark and when you hold it up to the light, an orange-red hue shines through the darkness. Poured a nice sandy tan head that dissipates to a thin covering. 
T - Amazing. Starts out with that great piney-citrus hop combo then gives way to the sweet chocolate notes and then finishes with some awesome hop bitterness and slight alcohol burn that balances out the beer. 
P - The palate is perfect on this for me. It has a thick smoothness with just the right amount of carbonation to make it not feel like sludge running through your mouth. 
O - Overall a home run for me. One of the best beers I have had so far and the best Black IPA (that I have had). It is everything I want from this style. The hops and the malts pair nicely with each other and are melded together with the perfect amount of carbonation to make this a fantastic beer.","Alabama, USA","HuntHops"

3962,"2012-02-11",3.4,"[660ml bottle shared with Simon at the Bootlegger, High Wycombe] Black with a moderate beige head and a light fizz.  Dominated by piney hops that verge at times on loo cleaner.  Theres a citrus hint in there too, but really its all about the pine.  The dark malts add surprisingly little other than a hint of coffee and a rich toffee mouthfeel - theres none of the roasted/burnt flavour youd normally associate with them.  The alcohol was rather too evident in a finish that was sweeter than I expected, although still with some dryness to it.  For me, the pine in this beer was a bit over the top, and it lacked balance as a result; however, after a poor start it grew on me and I was quite enjoying it by the end.

Aroma: The best I have ever experienced in a beer. Smells exactly like I opened a package of hops and stuck my nose in it. Perfect!

Appearance. Pours black with a thicker tan head that quickly dissipaters to a thin layer. Moderate lacing noted. 

Taste: Finally a Black IPA that suits me. Taste is firm hop bitterness equivalent to a DIPA. Tart grapefruit notes balance perfectly with a solid malt back bone. Very balanced. Would of liked just a tad less bitterness to appreciate the malt profile. 

Palate. Decent mouth feel with a strong finish. I get that smack you up side the hop head sensation even though I dont find this beer overly bitter. I think this is from the fantastic aroma gives the sensation there are more hops there. 

Overall I truly enjoyed this beer. It was simple but yet complex. I very much enjoyed the perfect hop aroma. It is very well balanced and finally showed me that a balanced Black IPA could exist.","Louisiana, USA","Smurfe"

3962,"2011-09-06",4.2,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Nonic Imperial Point.

Appearance: Near black with thick foamy tan head and nice lacing rings.

Aroma: Very hoppy and roasted aroma. Pine, citrus and molasses are at the forefront. Somewhat floral as well, like roses.

Taste: Roasted malt backbone with molasses and coffee. Complex, bitter hops override the malts, especially on the finish with loads of pine and grapefruit. Doesnt mesh quite as well as I hoped.

Palate: Moderate carbonation, pretty smooth body with a dry, warming finish.

Overall: This is a style that I really like when it strikes the proper balance between roasted malts and citrusy hops. This one just misses that balance, but is very good nevertheless.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"
3962,"2011-09-05",4.0,"65 cl bottle @ Euston Tap, London.
Rated on 20110721.
Pours dark hazy red colour with small off-white head. Aroma is licorice, dark roasted malts, orange peel, mandarin, mango, caramel and distant notes of toffee at the end. Flavour of licorice, roasted malts, orange, mandarin, caramel and a bit of vanilla. I have to admit my expectations on this one were quite high, sadly there werent anything that would have separated this from other good black IPAs, but definitely one of the best Ive had. Sort of like a mix of Nøgne Ø #100 and #500.

3962,"2011-08-26",3.7,"A: Dark brown body with a darker off white head that approaches a soft sand-khaki. Spotty lacing remains as the head slowly subsided.

S: Roasted malt, chocolate, pine, fresh grass, and bark.

T: I am really not sure what the appeal is with these ""black IPAs."" The nose hinted at a harmonious marriage of darker roasted, toasted, and earthy malts with earthy, resinous, pine hops. Unfortunately, the flavor doesnt really come together as well. The malts used here added a bit too much sweetness and contrasted a bit harshly with the hops which sliced their way forward, but with a bit inconsistency.

When dealing with IPAs/dIPAs I like to think of malt as a canvas and the hops as paint. A quality canvas is necessary for the paint to adhere to, standout from, and leave a lasting impression. That said, the malts dont need to be bland, boring and hidden. But the canvas cant be full of ridges and valleys that alternately shed and pool the paint. Here the malt did just that, spiking out at times with too much malt, and at times just assaulting with bitter hops.

All said, it wasnt unpleasant. Just a tad frustrating with what ""could"" have been done here.

M: Medium bodied. Prickly carbonation. A bit of excess sweetness in the finish that could have been more crisp and defined.

D: A good, style-bending beer. Not sure if the experiment works for me in the long run though.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"

Taste is much the same, dominated by a rich and refreshing bitterness from the hops, yet with a subtle underlying touch of roasted malt, caramel and maybe a hint of cocoa.

3962,"2011-07-18",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 3, 2012 Bottle pour ---> Goblet. Rich smooth black pour with a nice silky head. Aromas were pungent of pine, hops, grapefruit (ZEST) and some spices. Id say it smelled like a fresh Christmas tree. The flavor was intense of hops, both bitter AND roasty that gave it a sour twang to it, awaking the tastebuds. The alcohol wasnt well hidden, and that helped the roasted malts provide a robust deep sweet spiciness. Unlike anything Ive drank or smelled - and a beer that has to be tried at least once.","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"
3962,"2011-07-17",3.9,"22 oz bottle from Binnys (Bolingbrook, IL). Finally grabbed this. Just never committed since its always around. Pours a pretty blackish hue with dark suntea brown bottom and edges. Not opaque, letting a brownish glow come through the bottom and edges well. A decent sized lighter brown frothy head stays as a decent layer, laces ok overall. Aromas are a prominent citrusy hopping. Grapefruit meets roasted malts, some toffee, cocoa. A light coffee appeal with more lemons and fresh green hops. Dry florals. Really nice, as the sweetness makes an appearance and the roast doesnt become overbearing. Initial is medium bodied offering that telltale clash of bitter green hops, lots of grapefruit and citrus mixing with roasted malts, dry florals, and dry roasty coffee. Touches of cocoa as the middle sweetens things up a bit more, caramel and toffee, sweet and sticky with cocoa lingering on. Drys up more and remains roasty in the finish, though I feel the hops take control over the roast, which I rather enjoy. A lot of people dont really get this style or like it.. but I think this is a great beer, great example of the style offering a healthy hopping that hangs on for the ride and doesnt let the roast or toast overtake it. Its about the hops, not the roast and coffee, cocoa and sweetness. Well done.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

3962,"2011-07-15",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2014 It does pour like a porter, espresso black but not crude oilthick like a stout, and develops a decent head that accurately hints at the level of carbonation that will come once you sip the stuff. The aroma is rich of piney hops but also sweeter, fruitier ones, yielding notes of pine needles as well as peach, mango, and citrus. Theres also the roasted character, with burnt sugar, some caramel, hints of coffee, and a touch of dark chocolate. The taste follows, with lots of bitterness balanced out by a nice sweet character. Its really powerful. The hops handily overpower the roasted malts. The body is not thin but not thick, either, with soft carbonation that gives it a creamy palate feel.

Aroma comes across as this dank and earthy hop character, with big notes of pine.  Its huge!  Roasted grain and chocolate are buried in the nose.  You have to work your way past the incredible hop aroma but theyre in there.  Then theres the whole matter of taste.  Hops shatter the palate first, with a prolonged bitterness in the finish. The first taste is all hops.  As you acclimate youll be able to start to pick at the malt profile a bit more, but the first taste is jarring.  I like the mouthfeel as well.  Its slick and despite all the hops never gets sticky.  This beer finishes very dry (something Ive noticed with most Stone beers), as the malt character never goes overboard into sweet territory.  Instead it opts for roasted and nutty, with a slight bitter coffee note.  Thats not the best description.  Let me put it this way Ive toasted pine nuts, getting them to the point where theyre almost too dark, and thats what this malt flavor reminds me of.  Its not burnt, but is right there on the edge.  Theres also some definite alcohol warmth but Im not picking up any fusels in the nose or taste, very impressive.  Its not often that I find a beer that lives up to my expectations when trying it, but Sublimely Self-Righteous does that and then some.  Not sure if its possible, but this is a textbook example of an emerging style.",", Missouri, USA","VengefulOdin"

Bitter, chocolate crystal malt sweetness to the finish. Palate is medium bodied, creamy, neutral entry, moderate, not to sharp carbonation and dry somewhat astringent finish.

I came across this gem at the Avenue Pub on St. Charles Ave. in New Orleans while on vacation.  If you like hoppy Pale Ales, do yourself a big favor and try this one.

The flavor did reveal some actual dry dark chocolate (more than I expected) as it warmed, though there was still plenty of hop bitterness dominating the profile. Reasonably dry, though I had also had a taster of the Double Dry Hopped Sublimely next to it, and that was not markedly but sufficiently different--softer in palate (was it casked?) and quite a bit softer in its hop profile too.  That was surprising; much less an IPA, more of a sense of it being a sophisticated DIPA.

Aroma is heavy pine and citrus rind with nutty roasted notes and touch of dark chocolate. Pine aroma overpowers, but a nice swirl brings out the malt nose. Taste of candied nut quickly leads way to resinous, piney hops.  With a rather bitter, though not at all unpleasant finish.

Aroma is pretty strong of piney and citrus hops, with plenty of grapefruit, light lemon, and some orange zest.  Slightly resinous.  Mint shows up to the party.  Does resemble OFF bugspray from time to time with the heavy hopping, and the malts are really dialed down, with only a suggestion of roasted malt peeking out underneath the hops.  Malts are more prominent in the flavor, with a roasty and chocolate undertone pairing well with the otherwise Double-IPA like flavors.  Pine, grapefruit rind, and juniper all show up here, and the finish is appropriately bitter.  Mouthfeel is medium to slightly full, with toned-down carbonation.

3962,"2011-03-30",4.0,"Bottle, thanks to my parents for bringing this back from Vegas for me. Ive been trying to track this one down for a while. Pours very dark brown, though not quite black; excellent clarity, thick pale tan head, very nice lacing - which seems to be rather a hallmark for Stone. Nose is big grapefruit and sharp pine notes, which is fine as I feel the softer hop notes are hidden by the darker malts, as opposed to being entirely absent. I get just tiny flashes of florals or stonefruit, but its gone just as I try to pin it down... Further nosing reveals dark roast, lightly soapy, which seems to be playing off a bit of soapiness from the hops as well as the malt. Flavours of big bitter grapefruit, light soap, some really intense pine notes, roast is way in the background, and comes out as a lightly coffeeish note in the finish, though it is present all the way through. Strikes me as Arrogant Bastard with more Roasted malts, and more pine-driven hops, as opposed to softer, more citrus-juice driven ones. Well-balanced, clean finished. Just another beer in the ""Stone Hoppy Beers"" spectrum, which is as predictable as it is excellent.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","Savvy1982"

Some sweet malts makes this remind me of a barley wine. Very hoppy, slight citrus with a very sweet yet subtle malt characteristic. Great grapefruit taste. This makes me crave a barley wine for comparison. Definitely more hoppy than a barley wine but the malts are wonderful in this.

The taste is bitter and hoppy, with some slight coffee character. It is slightly metallic as well. The hops are piney and mix with the metallicness to create a flavor im not too keen on.

The so called black IPAs seem to be more gimmicks than anything, it seems like no brewers have taken the time to make the perfect recipe for it.

3962,"2011-02-25",3.7,"22 oz bomber.  Pours dark brown, almost the color of a porter but a bit more translucent.  Thin, tan head.  Interesting to drink a beer this dark and have it be this hoppy.  I expected the maltiness to balance out the hoppyness but the hops come through a lot more, although this isnt a bad thing.  The usual citrus, pine, floral notes of an IPA dont come through near as much in this beer, but the bitterness is definitely there. I thought it would be a little sweeter, given the alcohol content.   Subtle hints of dry chocolate, licorice, cough syrup and resin are present also.  Not the most amazing beer Ive ever had but one of the more interesting and creative ones.  Thumbs up for sure.","Montana, USA","kev1001"
3962,"2011-02-25",3.7,"On tap at the Meddlesome Moth, Dallas. It pours jet black with a thick tan head. The nose is rich-roast coffee, toffee, brown sugar, marshmallow and pine. The taste is of burnt sugar, toast, bread, coffee, molasses, soy, pine and hay. It has a medium to thick body and the finish is burnt, smokey and mighty bitter. I find it perhaps a bit too savoury, but enjoyable none the less.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"

3962,"2011-02-09",4.1,"Draft from Coalhouse Pizza, Stamford, CT. Served in a pitcher and sipped in mason jars. This is a dark brown brew with a brown head with wonderful lacing. Aroma? To be honest, I have a cold, so I couldnt smell much, but this beer had a sweet tobacco, dark fruit, caramel, and even a cherry hint. Despite its ABV and color, this wasnt too strong of a beer, and it went well with my chicken wings. Hoppy, but not irritating, like how some Stone brews are a little too intense. I really like this .","Connecticut, USA","joebudzjoe"
3962,"2011-02-09",4.0,"The hoppy aroma is so intense, youre eyes will water. Just behind it is a malt that smells similar to a strong rye bread. The mixture of the two sensations is unusual and amazing. The head is off-white and fades after a time. The brew is a dark caramel, letting only the slightest light pass through. The taste is unapologetic in its extreme hoppyness. The malts rye quality is right there to back it up. Silky and milky on the palate, the bitterness of the hops continues into the aftertaste, but does not take anything away from your enjoyment.","Villa Park, Illinois, USA","Wolfenkopf"

3962,"2011-02-06",3.9,"Rating #300. 650 mL bottle from Premier Gourmet in Buffalo, served in an English pint glass. Pours clear reddish black with a moderate, dense tan head. The head mostly remains, leaving behind a small amount of fine lace. The nose has huge hoppy notes of citrus and pine, along with grain, biscuit malts, roasted malts, flowers and a touch of chocolate. The flavour is intensely bitter throughout, with a slight roasty sweetness. There are notes of citrus, flowers and chocolate carried over from the aroma, along with a moderate peppery spiciness. On the palate, it is full in body with a smooth, milky texture and average carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent black IPA. It is smooth and subtle, very harmonious. High-alpha hops are paired elegantly with complex roasted malts. Another delight from Stone. 2011-02-06","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"
3962,"2011-02-01",4.3,"This is a go to beer for me. When the 11th anniversary came out I must have drank 20 bottles. It was my first time with a black ipa and frankly I never looked back. Though I feel the 11th was better than the sublimely I was still stoked to have it available year round.

It bours black with a root beer hue. The head is an inviting tan. Smell is pure hops and I love it. The subtle toasted malt are present as well. This beer is the definition of an iba. The color is black bit it drinks like an ipa. Super hoppy and delicious. Nothing bad to say about this other than the smaller batch of the 11th was better. I still have 4 bottles of the 11th and I drank one the other day. The profile is completely different as youd expect. The piney hop flavors are gone and the malt flavors are huge, its almost choclatey. It is a completely different beer but still delicious!","Carlsbad, California, USA","HopMasterFlex"

3962,"2011-01-29",3.9,"Definite hop-bomb on the nose -- smells a lot like what you might imagine a bottle of IPA extract would smell like, if such a thing did exist.  Poured into an old jelly glass, it was coal black, although a tinge of a ruby/mahogany-like tint may show through if you hit the other side with a 500 watt halogen shop light, or maybe the tip of a plasma cutter.  A relatively thick tan-khaki head forms, slowly dissipating to a thin layer that laces all the way down.  I imagine a scoop of the initial froth would make a decent medium-strength adhesive.  Initial taste is reminiscent of that time when I was 6 or 7 years old and I accepted a dare to stop a spinning bicycle tire with my tongue.  It made the perfectly mediocre Honduran cigar I had lit at the time taste like I was sucking on an unlit toilet paper tube.  After the alcohol hit and the hop assault rendered that particular part of my palate comatose, I noticed the piney, grapefruity-citrus notes, and a malty presence that is hard to define, much like trying to discuss the subtlety of the triangle players performance during the last section of a performance of the 1812 Overture.  With real cannons.  Mouthfeel is truly sublime -- a silky, velvety envelopment awaits you, once the first few kilotons of hop yield completely overwhelm that aspect of your senses.  I have no trouble admitting that my palate needs further development before I can wax poetic about this beers awesomeness.  My Uncle Marvin (Yes, Him -- Marvin Edgeworth) might be disappointed in me since he called Arrogant Bastard ""...a moderately hoppy beer"", but at this point I can only say that this one is a ""once or twice a year"" beer for me.  Stunningly complex.  Nuclear hoppiness.  At this point in my beer education, its just a bit much. But I like it, even though Im not sure why...","Canyon Lake, Texas, USA","JSG4dFan"

Near perfect use of hops in my opinion-not too much of any one flavor. Coats my entire mouth and just the right carbonation.

But the taste, ahh Full boatload of those amazingly bitter USs hops (the web site mentions Simcoe and Amarillo, and that I can find easily). Black malts show most prominently on my lips as a bitter buzz, then some at the back of my throat, combining the qualities of coffee roast stout and black lager. No oily smoothness like an imperial stout. So the alcohol goes down imperceptibly. The roasty malts almost make one forget the huge hop load here. So its stout and IPA, two great tastes that taste great together!","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

Taste if bitter chocolate and Big earthy hops, the dark fruits &  malts lend some sweet notes, some yeasts add to a good complexity, alcohol more present as it warms. Full body with good zesty carbonation start to finish, good hop bite and dry finish. A good bold brew (not for the pale ale crowd).

A: Pours a dark molasses from the bottle with a large, two-finger tan head. The brew was barely transparent as it was being poured, and is opaque in the glass. Plenty of carbonation apparent, and the lacing is tremendous.

S: Very rich malt is the initial scent. Raisins and dates are apparent, but molasses, dark malt, and a tiny bit of brown sugar are the most prevalent here. Excellent. Hops are still there as well.

T: Deliciously rich! Malt and molasses are immediately apparent, as are all of the dark fruit undertones. Some hop bitterness remains. I dont know what this was like when initially released, but it is an absolute delight now, at what I assume is around two years of age?

M: Incredibly smooth with moderate carbonation, creamy mouthfeel, medium to full body, and just the right alcohol pinch.

D: Pretty high abv and a lot to handle. I think a single bomber of this is definitely enough, although it probably wont last in my glass for too long.

3962,"2010-10-24",3.9,"I thought that this brew was extremely interesting style. So I had to try the stone take on it. Again Stone tends to take their hops seriously I figured a black IPA form them would be one to try.

Bottle pored into a stone IMP pint glass produced a gracious two finger off white to brown head on top of a dark brown body. The head turned into a nice lace that followed the body of the brew down the glass.

There is a huge hop nose on this brew you just cant get past it. This wasnt to much of a shock coming from stone. Big old grapefruit with a tad bit of roast in the end. The flavor was interesting to say the least. You get a good bitter hop flavor with a slight roasted bitter coming thru in the end. That basically sums it up.

Smell: Piney hops with a hint of pineapple to go along with a background of roasted malt.

Taste: Extremely hoppy throughout but there are a few flavors poking through which make this quite complex. Citrus up front followed by a little roasted malt in the middle then a blast of bitter grapefruit at the finish. Aftertaste is lemon zest.

Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Feels creamy and prickly at the same time. Hops are pretty sticky.

Drinkability: High drinkability. I wouldnt recommend pounding bomber after bomber but this is a beer you wont get tired of too quickly.

Appearance: The body has an opaque dark black color with a thick light tan head on top. The head is long lasting and makes for tons of cool lacing on the glass. 

Smell: The aroma has solid roasted and toasted maltiness with caramel like sweetness backed up by equally solid citrusy hops. 

Taste/Palate: Its deep maltiness sets up a firm base for the hops to work there bitter magic. From the base malt I get firm toasted and roasted character with loads of caramel like sweetness that weaves in and out of the dominate hops. The hops bring a big hit of citrus and pine like bitterness. Notes of grapefruit, lime, bitter orange and pine resin hang onto the tongue long into the slow fading finish. The big full body brings a heavy slow sipping and sticky texture with just enough carbonation to keep things from getting cloying.

Pleasantly hoppy flavor with a nice bitter floral strain that melds with a stream of lightly roasted chocolate, mostly absent any acrid roast notes. Sour bitter roast and hop twang on the finish.

Toasted malts also come through.  The palate is lightly hoppy in the approach and mid-palate, reminiscent of an English pale ale; pleasant, but again evidence of being over-aged.

OK.. so 

A. Pours out black with a nice light tan head. Nice lacing. Not much light comes through the black. Maybe a bit, with a tad dark brown and ruby highlights... but faint. 

S. Roasted malt, Hops, and a hint of cherry. Very compelling. 

T. Fist comes the roasted malt, followed immediately by fresh hops, then finishing with a black cherry followed by bitterness that sticks for a bit. Very nice. 

M. Medium body, Creamy, Slightly sticky, with a well balanced carbonation.

3962,"2010-08-17",4.0,"Bottle from summer secret santa, thanks santa! Opens with a nice pop, pours black with red highlights and a thick, light brown head that slowly fades to a ring, leaving plenty of sticky lacing. Aroma mostly dominated by citric hops, but with some grain, some vague coffee and roasted notes, a hint of liquorice, raisins or prunes. The hops add a bit of floral fruitiness to the flavour of it, instead of pure citrus like the nose gave away. Starts off fruity, goes basically straight into the hop juiciness. Definitely some burnt and roasted malts in here, a mixture of burnt espresso like bitterness and hoppy bitterness in the finish. Well balanced with the sweetness of the malts, which doesnt come through as grainy as in the aroma. More pure roasted and burnt malts, but perhaps a baked or toasted bread/cookie sort of thing going on. A bit of alcohol burn when it warms. Ample carbonation, but not agressive, making the body nice and full, with a creamy mouthfeel. Reading my review this far, theres nothing I really pin down as bad or unpleasant apart from the alcohol when it warms. Still, its not really striking me as an outstanding brew. Its complex, melds together well, good balance, good mouthfeel, but still not really striking me as fantastic. I think its because I like more floral, fruity and juicy IPAs, and this black IPA business might not be entirely my thing. Still, its a very good brew.","Årnes, NORWAY","Kestral"

Medium full body, carbonation is complementary, coats tongue slightly.  Overall, quite good - the flavors and aromas play nice with each other.

3962,"2010-07-07",4.3,"Although I have already rated this beer, I did so from memory and basic field notes. So, in the name of fairness and total legitimacy, Ive decided to rate this great beer again with it right in front of me - the only side note being: that this, I assume is a new batch, as I first tasted the beer a year ago, and the place I get it from has only just restocked it, along with the new 2010 Old Guardian Barley Wine. So here goes: What an aroma! This beer has a nose that is just sensational. So much to take in - be in no doubt, this may look like a stout, pouring black with red hues at the edge of the glass, but its big IIPA hops to the fore! Along with highly resinous, earthy smelling hops theres some grapefruit, loads of caramel and toffee, treacle, pepper - almost a note of celery... Theres also a good bit of sweetness in the background reminiscent of candy-floss or boiled sweets. Flavour is pretty darn mental. First up the hops definitely do the talking with loads of resinous flavours, bordering on rubber/leather, then theres is an element of smoke and mineral, a truly roasted, pretty much charcoal bitterness. There are also ark fruit flavours such as bitter plum and blackberry, though without much citric tartness, having said that though, there is still a flavour reminiscent of grapefruit. There are some sweeter notes, once again more candied than anything else, I want to avoid using words like ""chocolate"" and ""coffee"" as that would be too easy under the circumstances, as it may look black, but this is no stout. The finish is big BIG bitterness ( you could almost mistake the bitterness for espresso, but its most definitely alpha acids bringing the hit) More charcoal and wet stones/slate in the finish also, with the tiniest hint of fruit. Finish has considerable length, almost like a great mature cheddar. I have to admit, Ive hardly even scratched the surface as far as the complexity of this beer is concerned. But rest assured it has many levels to investigate, and shall reward any experimenter handsomely if you spend the necessary time with it. Truly wicked beer!","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"

A- Body is a nearly opaque black hue. When held up to the dim light some brown comes through around the edges. Served with a 1/2 finger or so off-white head which fades to a thin collar-traces of lacing are left behind in the glass.

S- An assault of grapefruit and pine come through initially with a much weaker, but still present roasted malt backbone.

T- Like many stone brews the flavor upfront is big. It offers a lot of white grapefruit flavor with a substantial roasted malt backbone. The hops are definitely the highlight of the flavor-but the dark roasted malt backbone isnt hiding. The finish adds a good amount of refreshing pine-as the bitterness builds. The lingering hop bitterness is moderate in strength and does not become cloying- the roasted malt flavors linger for about the same amount of time but are slightly milder.

P- Medium to high tingly carbonation with a medium to heavy weight, full, oily body.

O- In summary-This is a very hoppy black IPA-I wouldnt say its balanced-but the malt is not hiding. And with anything IPA I expect it to be very hoppy. This brew is pretty aggressive and very good overall. ABV is completely hidden by the flavors this brew exceeds my expectations for this hybrid style.

There is some good stability in a medium mouthfeel.  The taste is both sugary like molasses and hoppy.  But it is not too bitterly hopped.  It really seemed mild considering it is supposed to be a strong ale.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
3962,"2010-05-22",5.0,"Let em start by saying Im Irish, and damned proud of it. I gre up with great European beers, even though I never had a tase for lighter beverages, I appreciated them. But Guinness and Warstainer Dunkel were always my drinks of choice. 
Then, one glorious day, I had my first Arrogant Bastard Ale. What was this?, I asked. An american brew with actual character, bitterness, distinction and real FLAVOR. I was hooked. Since that day I have enjoyed Stone products without reserve. Then this, the apex of the art of brewing, the pinnacle of malt perfection. Amazing. From the appearence, resembling Tyra banks in a glass, to the phenomenal bitterness that recalls a fresh, hurtful divorce, to the finale of aftertaste that is remeniscient of the afterglow of a first sexual experience, this f*&^er rocks. I am only sorry that its not readily available on tap. A downer for sure, but I am content, for that moment to indulge in one of the other remakable Stone products while watching the ignorant masses let the yellow runnings of lesser productions wash over their tongues like so much hobo urine over the abandoned city curbs in a derelict metropolis.","USA","celticindian"

But as the pour is finished, I hold it up to the light only to see a very small amount of light escaping through this black concotion.  An attractive tan and creamy head forms lasting for the whole glass.  Beautiful lacing is left behind just hanging on the glass.  Thick resinous hops fill the air as the beer is poured.  A wonderful mixture of sweet citrusy tropical fruits like mangoes and nectarines are very easy to notice.  There is a bit of an underlying roasted malt with chocolate character that is really quite terrific.  It has a somewhat viscous and oily mouthfeel to it and yet, its very smooth and creamy, almost silky on the tongue.  Wonderful mouthfeel!  Wow, the hops are just powerful in this!  As the flavors come it, I pick up a small note of the roasted barley balancing out the very bitter hops.  The hops show several different flavors of pine, earth, and some citrusy fruits as well.  The finish is long and bitter.  Very unique, but very good!","North Canton, Ohio, USA","beerchugger"

3962,"2010-05-09",4.3,"In 2007 as Stone 11th Anniversary Ale, from a 22oz bottle...

The look is pitch black. Has a large bubbly light brown head. Looks like a stout more than anything. Absolutely opaque. Contains a thick swath of lace as it is emptied.

The smell is of a citrusy IPA, with bitter, woody hops. No stout smell at all. There are magnificently complex hops here (grapefruit, pine, other citrus) with mild dry-English malt thrown in. Its perfect. A real bouquet. Hops are oily and rich. Its a traffic-stopper. Has a hint of dark chocolate.

So it looks like a stout, smells like an IPA. What next?

The taste is major bitter hops, but with a unique burnt coffee malt. Like an India Pale Porter/Stout. Oily bitter hops and dry bitter malt both fight it out. Hops come out strong, and malt takes the later rounds. Rich malt steps up as it warms, with hops as an accent more than anything. It evolves with the temp change.

Thick, smooth, oily feel. Dry roasted malt finish. Its motor oil. Overall its a big, thick, oily, dark, hoppy, nutty, roasted brew. Too big for all night long, but absolutely perfect for one bottles worth.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

Flavor a battle between those piney hops and a good dose of caramel/light toffee/slightly roasted malt sweetness.  Lingering bitter finish lasts until the next sip.

The flavors are richly malty, with some chocolate, toffee, light coffee and caramel, but they are toward the finish of the flavors.

Taste was complicated.  There was a distinct sweetness that reminded me of a dubbel or trippel, but the hops or dark malt or whatever was in it managed to keep a terrific bitterness that kept it from being too sweet.   Note: nowhere close to as bitter as Arrogant Bastard or any of the Stone IPAs.  Had a light smokey flavor that sticks with you.  Ive given high marks simply because it isnt like anything else Ive run into.","Alabama, USA","horto008"

Normally you would expect a beer this dark to be sweet and heavy. But this one comes across like some crazy hybrid of just about everything Stone does well and the result is awesome. Pours fairly thick, like a porter say, and as dark as a stout but with more carbonation. A nice, thick toasted brown head forms. The scent is almost all hops with notes of chocolate and roasted malt. The taste is a beautiful melange of hops, dark chocolate, coffee, and raisins. Not too sweet and not too bitter.

Not only is the aroma very pleasant, but is quite strong as well.  Flavor follows suit, heaps of hop bitterness, pine and citrus, contrasted with a lot of rich chocolate malt in the middle, some caramel, anise, toffee, alcohol.  Big and bold.

The aroma consists of dark dried fruit, floral hops, and some sweet notes. The taste had the same characteristics as the aroma with some roasted malt thrown in for good measure.

3962,"2010-04-13",3.5,"Bomber into pint glass.  Pours a dark brown, almost black with a decently dense dirty tan/off-white head.  The aroma is a bit confusing.  It has a solid hop presence, but the malt/yeast profile just seems a bit muddled and amorphous (i.e. not fitting of any traditional style... making it suitable to be classified in the amorphous category ""American Ale"").  Dont get me wrong, it smells good, with the hops and all, just a bit confusing on the whole.  The flavor is equally confusing.  Again, the hops shine through nicely, but it also has a very roasty character and an almost acidic overtone.  The alcohol is hidden well.  I may be getting a bit of oxidation here, but it might just be the character of the strange malt bill.  It is medium to full body on the palate with minimal smooth carbonation.  Overall: this is a solid beer, but even after the entire bomber, it still confuses me, which speaks to its uniqueness I guess.

The dudes at Stone can afford to be cocky, cuz they back it up with epic ales.  Im usually not that into super dark, heavy beers, but by giving it a hoppy IPA-edge, it winds up being the best of both worlds.  8.7% ABV?  Yes, please.","San Francisco, California, USA","JW32Hoops"
3962,"2010-04-05",3.3,"Black. Tan head of very fine bubbles lasts the duration and leaves splotches of lacing the whole way through the glass. Nose, at first, is just big American hops w/ a load of pine but w/ a strong underpinning of an acrid burnt coffee nature. It almost works but it doesnt quite. The flavor is actually a bit lighter than I expected and much less bitter. it tends more towards the coffee-like elements of the flavor. Really nice thick but soft mouthfeel though the alcohol is a bit distracting here as its rather hot. Dark fruit notes come out as it warms and the warming also seems to accentuated and soften the coffee in the nose. Finishes quick and clean w/o any lingering sweetness and just a touch of coffee-like bitterness. Interesting beer though, honestly, it kind of seems like something that sounded good on paper and maybe doesnt quite work as well in practice.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

The finish remains pretty heavy on the medicinal sweetness and bitter punch.  Mouthfeel is almost a disservice as it is a bit coating so therefore leaves the taste to linger a bit longer than it should.

3962,"2010-03-29",3.9,"Stone Brewing, how I love thee, let me count the ways


(The back of each and every Stone beer may tell you absolutely nothing about the beer in question but its a humorous delight to read even so.)


He poured his self-righteous self into my snifter in a gloriously arrogant display of deeply burnt browns tinged by earthen blacks and topped by a flamboyant cappuccino head that shamelessly flaunts itself. Lingering in the spotlight, his head cannot diminish the gloriously dark beauty looming beneath. Polished obsidian, earthen browns, and black licorice delights lend their beauty to his irresistible charms. One would not expect to be greeted by freshly picked hops when gazing upon his dark charms, but one should also know never to expect the expected from Stone. Fresh hop cones bleed between my fingers now sticky with pungent oils. I may live in Florida, but at this very moment I have stepped foot into a lush forest of pine, fir, and evergreen as far as the eye can see. Grapefruit whispers upon a mid-morning breeze faintly damp with dew and carrying upon it golden toast, freshly mowed grass, black licorice, and more gentle esters of grapefruit pith. Taking pause to simply savor the moment, I then move on to tasting the moment. Clean and hoppy, he flows smoothly from pine to burnt toast to black licorice then back to more pine before fading into a grapefruit pithy finish. Whole hop cones abound, their oils and resins enhancing the moment while black sweetness is a velveteen river flowing underneath. My breath exudes toast slightly burnt along the edges, burnt caramel, bark, and whole black cherries. Bitter and yet not bitter, sweet and yet not sweet, the balance is on a level of quaffing divinity I have not supped until now. Each component works together in perfect harmony as if blessed by the heavens herself. I wholly understand now while after once crafting this slice of liquid beervana, Stone Brewing simply could not bring themselves to forever retire the Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale. After all, a little arrogance never hurt anyone.


I am not going to continue espousing greatness upon this beer. Simply take what I have said unto heart, seek out a bottle immediately, maybe two, and sup immediately. Dont rush. Do nothing. Just simply relax, pour, smell, savor, and sup. All will be revealed.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

The aroma is dark malts, dark chocolate, some sweetness, and citrus and pine hops.  The flavor has more dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, the malts provide a mild level of sweetness, and the hops have faded a bit but still provide some citrus and pine.  There is still a moderate amount of bitterness to this especially into the finish.  Medium to medium-full bodied and maybe a bit more dry than when fresh.  This is still a very nice beer.

I get the hoppiness but then as someone in an earlier rating pointed out, I get a faint sense of horseradish, a little sting to the nose that nudges the aroma along..  Initial hit to the palate is pure stone.. I mean forget the color, this is not a malt dominated ale, this thing hops like a rabbit wearing springs..  A bitter pine, earthy  hop, with some roasted, toasty flavoring at the end.  the first sip was overpowering and surprising but it settles in nicely as it warms..  The bitterness lingers a little too long for my likeing but I know thats just stone tagging their name..

Notes of grape and alfalfa come into play as well.  Caramel and coffee notes seep into the aroma as it warms.  Mouth-feel is smooth and silky contrasting the flavor which is aggressive.  Tastes of American hops which begin with pine but become almost like horseradish, mint leaves, toffee and bourbon.  The flavor is also quite woody with lavender and violet notes.  finishes less forcefully than I would have expected but still strong and bitter balanced by traces of the dark malt and vanilla.  This is as very complex and interesting beer.  Not to be drank casually but it is excellent as a challenge to ones analytical powers.","Houston, Texas, USA","RickTStiles"

It looks like an imperial stout at first. Opaque dark brown body, with a nice light brown head and some visible carbonation. Good lacing and head retention. 

The aroma brings you an incredible combination of floral, juicy citrus-like hoppiness, with some caramel tones, and a nice rich roastiness, with hints of dark chocolate and espresso.
From the first sip, you might mistake it for a nice, full-flavoured west-coast IPA, with a good hop bite and some juicy grapefruit notes. The finish, however, has both the bitterness and some nice lingering chocolatey and coffee-like notes. There is also some dark fruit undertones, and a little bit of smokiness, too. Simply outstanding and extremely satisfying!

The beer coats the palate, very pleasant in the mouth! For a 8.9% beer, the alcohol is very well-masked!

Just because it is so full-flavoured and intense, the drinkability is unlike that of a session ale. But, mind you, it drinks very smoothly and with little effort.

3962,"2010-01-15",4.8,"Im always a little intrigued when a friend describes something as a ""black IPA,"" bit usually a little on the disappointed side when I try it.  Both descriptors set an expectation that is a touch contradictory; something that is hoppy-sweet and citrusy while at the same time roasty and malty.  The two tastes are powerful ones, and balance between the two is frequently perceived by me as a touch boring.  And RISs that shout about their hop content dont usually taste hoppy to me - just too much going on to pick up the more nuanced note of bitterness, even if they dumped bushels of high-alpha hops into the mix, my tongue just cant seem to enjoy them for everything else going on.

Wow - that is a long lead in to say that this beer is unique to say that it does this integration very well.  It pulls off the balancing act without being boring; in fact it pulls it off so well it does the opposite - this beer is intriguing.  It is dark and there is a dark-roasty-malt note to it, but it is also lightly sweet and citrus-y with pronounced bitterness.  Both notes are there, but Stone has figured a way to make them play well together.  If anything, the hops are more pronounced than the roast, which is the outcome I wouldve chosen (if given a choice).  Appearance is quite pretty with a black-red body and tall white head.  Aroma is as Ive described flavor, and mouthfeel is like a solid IPA - not slick like a DIPA might be or cloying like a RIS frequently is.

All the way around - this is a heck of a beer, and I need to see if I can find some of it here in C-bus.

Ive also had the pleasure to get a taste of the 13th Anniversary, and based on these two I now do vow to taste every one from here on out. This is an excellent beer. I can best describe it as an imperial IPA disguised as a brown ale. Or maybe a black IPA? Whatever the classification it scores big with me. The hop aroma comes charging out of the bottle as soon as it opens and the hop taste stays throughout along with many other complex flavors. Highly recommended.",", Massachusetts, USA","BroSpud"

3962,"2009-10-25",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 9, 2011 First sampled at Flying Saucers Second Annual Fall Beer Festival in Austin on October 24, 2009.  Most fortunately, now available on Texas shelves.  First off, this has a really good-looking super-fine, bold head thats very strong and thick and dense and big... when you shake the glass the head wobbles back and forth, in-tact.  A very strong head, and beautiful lacing.  Although it looks dark-brown as it pours, it has a deep, silky black color in the glass.  Black and beautiful.  Ana loves the artwork.  Aroma of expected Stone hoppiness.  The color is misleading (youd think I would have adjusted to the whole idea of black IPAs by now so I wouldnt be so shocked)... at this darkness at first I would have expected some roasted malts in the nose, but its mostly all hops - fresh and green - with an almost hay-like character.  Although dominated by hops, there is a bit of sweetness in the aroma.  In the mouth, it reminds me of a malty (but not roasted) IPA, more on the double IPA end of the spectrum with a caramelly-syrupy malt that teams up with a double IPA hop strength.  What roasted malts that have come through has given it just a hint of roast character, just enough darkness in the flavor so it doesnt take away from the hoppiness.  I think if Stone made a beer that was any more malty, well, it wouldnt seem like a true Stone beer.  When it first enters your mouth theres almost a pungent, peppermint or candy cane-like flavor that carries through.  Its very soft and creeamy in the mouth.  The malts do add just enough to the finish, though, with a roasted bitterness and a fumey-roasted hop experience that comes up the throat and into the nose.  Overall, it has a very unique roasted character to it, probably thanks to the fine selection and quantity of hops teamed up with the specialty malts used in this beer.  Proof that Stone is truly a fine brewer.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

(ReRate 10/9/09) SSR Growler from Stone. What an amazing beer. This one made it back on the flight from SD to IND and actually waited patiently in the growler for 19 days before I finally popped the swing top...not to worry, I was amazed at the freshness considering the traveling distance and time passed. Compared to the XI bottle, this had a much stronger fresh hop aroma that dominated the nose. Taste was very fresh as well with an excellent citrus hop flavor. If you close your eyes you swear its an ipa, but if you just look at it without smelling or tasting you would expect at least SOME roasted malt of coffee/chocolate. This is one of the greatest/wierdest beers Ive ever had....HOW did they get it SO dark without it tasting like a dark beer? Now I am curious to revisit the XI bottle (and age an SSR bottle) to see if it just takes time for the dark flavors to come out. After tasting the SSR from tap and all the hops it brought with it, Im not convinced it wasnt my imagination that picked out the dark flavors in the XI bottle I previously rated. Im mezmorized right now.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","awiseman01"

Second smell from the glass is chocolate and hops! This one is weird, has a chocolate taste, some hops with fruitiness and roastiness at the end. Good stuff and makes me want to revisit Averys 14th anniversary ale. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy but I am not sure that I could drink more than one bomber. For some reason the chocolate and hop combination makes me think of chocolate mints.

At first taste the bitterness from the hops make you cringe but if you have ever tried other Stone beers they do not hold back when it comes to flavor. After you get over the initial burst of hops you get a good taste of the malts. I feel as of they mixed a smoked porter with a ton of hops and came up with this beautiful mixture.

3962,"2009-08-11",4.5,"I had been staring at this beer in my refrigerator all weekend, then I finally got a chance to open last night and it was well worth the wait. The brewers at the Stone Brewing Company, located in Escondido, CA, pride themselves on being able to consistently produce such fine works of art like this truly self-righteous ale. This beer was first produced in 2007 as their annual anniversary edition release and was such a huge hit they had to make more. When you poor it into the glass the color is black as pitch with nose that similar to most imperial IPAs with notes of grapefruit that dissipate to hints of red fruits. The palate was bitter, but a balanced bitterness that comes from both the hops and malts, with hints of cranberries in the beginning and finishes long and dry.

3962,"2009-08-01",3.8,"22oz bomber. Pours black with subtle dark brown highlights and an immense, soft, pocked tan head that leaves a few thin but wide sheets of lace on the glass. The aroma starts with a pungent blast of hops. It smells like Chinook (and I should know because I still have Chinook resin on my fingers from harvesting them from my own plant this afternoon). There are other notes in there, too - perhaps grapefruit (centennial or amarillo?). And there is some alcohol and a touch of dry, dark roasted grain (like a background note of espresso). The flavor starts hoppy and bitter (since bitterness is usually registered at the back of the tongue, this must be some tannic/astringent mouthfeel influencing the flavor). This is some serious stuff. It is very hoppy - tingly pine needles and resin all over the tongue. After a few sips, fruity notes (prunes with chocolate?) appear up front. Instead of being balanced by malt sweetness (or at least a wave of bready, even if dry, malts), it is instead backed by a wave of drying roasty coffee-ish blackness. Intense. Its assault on the palate does not let up. At mid-palate, there are subtle smoky, almost woody, notes along with a very slight chocolatey/caramel malt sweetness. But the sweetness is brief. There is some fruity ester quality deftly tucked in there, but it is subtle. The finish is oh-so-dry with a big wave of roasty intense stoutiness following by surges of insane hop bitterness. This beer is very bitter. The mouthfeel is unbelievably good - velvety, full-body with a luscious loftiness from just the right level of carbonation. There is also a peculiar dryness and light astringency all over - but not enough to detract from the otherwise brilliant texture. Overall, slightly disappointing. Dont get me wrong - it seems like a wonderful beer in most aspects, but overall it is just not balanced enough. Ruination was intensely bitter but provided better balance. With a touch of sweetness somewhere in there, this could have been so much better. It is still a very nice beer, but the more I drink the more I find myself wishing it were a little less astringent - a little less brutal. Perhaps I only feel this way because Im drinking the whole bomber by myself. Had I been just drinking 11ounces, my palate might not be feeling so abused right now...","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

3962,"2009-07-20",4.0,"500 mL bottle into tulip. Pours a deep brown almost black with a two-finger tan head that has good retention and leaves some spotty lacing. Aroma is very powerful: lots of dark fruits, prunes, molasses, dark chocolate, strawberries, and big grapefruit hops that makes for an odd combination like a Belgian Strong Ale and IPA combined. Taste is just that: refreshing grapefruit hops are most prominent but as this warms it becomes more about dates, prunes and then moves to coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, and some smokiness.

3962,"2009-07-12",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2009 On tap at Stone Bistro.  Appears dark brown with a cream-colored head  just a shade lighter than your average stout.  Aroma is brightly floral with a hint of black-ashy malt.  Lemonade and bubblegum come to mind in the nose.  The palate is medium-light, allowing this ale to swish easily over ones tongue.  Self-Righteous starts with a blend of floral hops and crème brulee (a toasted/caramel blend of flavors).  The finish is indeed quite bitter and clean-tasting, with some late smoke.  Overall, this is a pretty interesting concoction, much like Southern Tiers Iniquity but better.  It is a fantastic drinking experience for its ability to shock you with the juxtaposition of black coloration and floral, IPA like body.  Reminded me of a black Arrogant Bastard with a bit more smoke!
update on Stone 11th Anniversary Ale 11/1/09 notes: bomber.  Pours brown with heavy lacing and a beige head.  Aroma is dried strawberries, pine, and milk chocolate.  Palate is medium, very lightly carbonated.  Flavor is a interesting blend, very hard to put a finger on.  Piney hops, semisweet dark chocolate, honeydew, dark malt, bubble gum sweetness.  Well, Im not sure if my rating of this beer should affect its near-finalized score; it is clearly a hoppy beer that has been matured to its detriment.  And I knew that coming in, but it was worth a try.  At this point, Sublimely Self Righteous is a way more satisfying black IPA. 3.4.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"

The mouthfeel is thick, syrupy, with noticable carbonation - nice.  The finish is where the piney hops dominate, and linger for a while.  Nicely crafted brew, very enjoyable.

Pineapples, pears, grapefruit, melon, and some faint berries. Flavor is very similar. Big, malty body with lots of aggressive fruits and earthy bitterness. Lots of dark caramels and some light toasted breads. Finishes dry with an intense lingering bitterness. Full bodied and very well balanced for such an assertive beer.

3962,"2009-05-01",2.9,"Pours near opaque, but actually very dark cola color when held to light. Off-white head dissipates quickly with a thin rim lace.

Nose is a mixture of light fruits, perhaps tropical in nature, and a sweet roasty-doughy component that almost reminds me of a fresh batch of donuts with chocolate icing.

Palate offers assertive grapefruity hops up front that bully the palate, with a malt in the background that has long ago submitted to the hop domination. Dark color somewhat betrays the flavor profile in the sense that if you drank it blind I suspect you would just wager that it is a DIPA. Finish is a little tart and the hops pucker the mouth a little too much.

3962,"2009-04-28",3.0,"This is an older bottle of 11th, so take this review somewhat in stride. However, fresh this beer didnt impress me either as opposed to the vast majority of people. Pours a very dark brown with a fairly hefty tan head. Aroma is of clean American hops - Centennial, Cascade, and Simcoe, as well as some very minor roast lurking behind the hops. Taste is mostly bitterness (now, fresh had a much more grapefruit bouquet), and a touch roasty. Not terribly exciting and I dont know why they deemed it worthy of being done again. Why not 6th? This isnt as complex, delicious, or enjoyable as straight Stone IPA, and the mild roastiness clashes with the hops in this case. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt, but I always applaud them for trying new things.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Avengedpoet"
3962,"2009-04-28",3.8,"On tap at Deep Ellum.  Body is black with very little light at the corners.  A tall creamy tan head had good resiliency and leaves spotty lacing.  The nose and initial flavor is full of fresh crisp hops, with citrus peel, grapefruit and watery pine notes.  The body feels heavy on the tongue, roasty and malty with lots of toasted nuts and chewy bread, but the hops and the carbonation carry this beer.  I sometimes think Stones carbonation detracts from the beer, being too lively and acting as a thinning agent on my pallate, but it works to their advantage with this beer and allows the hops to break through the roasty body and come alive.  Really nice.","Hyde Park, Massachusetts, USA","ElDuderino"

Very stoutish in appearance.  The flavor, that isnt so stouty.  It is wonderfully bitter.  Unusual for Stone to make such a bitter beer that doesnt hurt to drink.  The bitterness is just the right level until the finish which just closed it out nicely.  In the middle the malt flavor is actually... simple.  Not overly done or too one-sided.

3962,"2009-02-12",3.7,"Bottle courtesy of sholland119 poured into a tulip.  Its the original Stone 11th Anny, not the newer incarnation.

Pours a dark mahogany that settles in almost-black in the glass underneath a huge three-finger tan head that sticks to the glass impressively as it recedes to a small cap.

The aroma has retained quite a bit of its hops despite being well over a year old.  Its mostly citrus hops in the nose with lots of grapefruit.  Hints of caramel malts, but not too much.

The taste has some of the citrus hops up front but hasnt retained the hops quite as well as the aroma indicated.  There is more of a malty base with some caramel sweetness and a slight floral hop bitterness in the finish.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and sticky, with what remains of the hops stinging the palate in the finish.

This is still a very good beer, but Ill definitely be looking for the new version to see what it tastes like fresh.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

S- Nose is distinctly ""Stone IPA"" with big bold swaths of pine and citrus hops cutting through the olfactory senses, some sweet malts along for the ride in the background and modest alcohol presence that will not be overlooked (I also caught a bit of smoke, vanilla, and wood as it warmed up)
T- Initial taste hits you with a strong push of grapefruit/pine hops and a bit of vanilla and slowly transitions to some sweet malts, finish is lasting and characterized by dry bitterness and alcohol warming down the throat
M- Medium/full bodied ale with smooth and slick mouthfeel backed by a good amount of carbonation
D- Getting close to 9% abv means you have to watch yourself with this beer, the aroma carries more alcohol presence than the actual flavors, but this specialty release deserves to be enjoyed slowly (not in mass quantities)","San Diego, California, USA","BrotherGrendel"

I was pretty wasted when trying this, but I was still extremely impressed with the dark color. I also loved the balance between the hops and the malts. The beer was surprisingly hoppy to me. I was expecting the malts to dominate, but there was an extremely awesome balance. Very nice palate that is creamy and smooth. I have to say, this is better than most of the Stone beers. I want to try the Self Righteous version and see if it is different than the 11th anniversary edition. Overall, an amazin ASA that has an excellent palate and aroma.

3962,"2008-11-29",4.5,"This supposedly retired beer arrived in Georgia a year late, but that was OK by me.  The pour surprised me at first, because I had not read the full blurb on the back of the silk screened label, and was expecting an IPA.  But the last line gave the clue to what this looked like, dark, pitch dark.  When held up against the light, some ruby highlights showed up, but otherwise this was pretty much a black beer in terms of look.  The head atop seemed small but stable, and was quite light in color, which was in stark contrast to the body.  The smell was like a hop field, which pine and grapefruit smells being quite prominent.  Underneath them, there was some chocolate lurking there.  The taste was quite hoppy indeed, which made me wonder if this was not a year old bottle, but rather a fresh brewed batch for us on the East coast.  The spicy, prickly, earthy hoppyness was just as intense as any IPA, however the black patent malt astringency, and some chocolate flavor were unusual, but went surprisingly well with that.  The body was more in line with IPA than the looks suggested, and this was very drinkable for me, since I like hoppy beers.  Quite a unique combination, but it works.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

3962,"2008-08-21",4.4,"22oz bottle labeled Sept. 2007. Pours beautiful black, with tan head that lingers. Nice, glimmering lacing. Roasty-smell, taste also reflects roasty toasty-ness(?), dark fruits, and perhaps some coffee or chocolate? Very complex beer, tastes amazing, good amount of carbonation for a beer this dark. Finishes smooth, and the aftertaste produces varying flavors to savor as you watch your Trappist glass empty!

3962,"2008-08-19",4.2,"22 oz bottle around its release date and around July 20th, 2008.  Ahhhh, I love it when beers are this good.  This pours a silky looking black with lots of carbonation leading to a nice tar looking retentive head.  Some of my fondest beer aroma memories come from allowing my nose to open up to the sweet yet bitter and roasty notes of the aroma that comes blasting off this one.  Its like a blended of hoppy banana almost...absolutely amazing!  The flavor continues to impress bringing a thick malt coating to the palate before balancing it out with tons of roasted malt mixed with a HUGE hop blast!  You can reeeeally tell this one is dry-hopped, even a year on it didn’t take away from the bliss!  Almost liquoricey in the finish...this beer is just that GOOD.  Now I just need to find more!

Also tried @ RBSG, on cask with wet simcoe hops (my score still reflects the bottle), which kicked in a robust hop aroma, and tipped the scales to the hop side, but still worked wonderfully.","Florida, USA","JMFG"

I even poured this into the same trappist glass from the original rating to see how well I had done early on in the rating and the rating was pretty accurate and I still think this is a really nice beer.

Definitely not a porter or stout, this is something different.  Tarrish finish that sticks with you pretty good.

I could see the potential for this to be a black IPA, but it came more across as a very hoppy porter, regardless of the commercial description. Immensely bitter, the aroma and hop flavor has diminished and the roasted grains really press through at this point, some coffee and molasses.

There are some hops in the nose, but it is much more of a sweeter maltiness, that follows through onto the palate where the hops become much more pronounced.  This is a really unclassifiable style for me, it is kind of between a couple of them, a hybrid of sorts.  It works though, this is really well balanced and a little on the rich side, but then follows through with some dry bitterness in the finish.

The remarkable feat of a clean, sharply hopped roasty ale with no edges. A great success from Stone.


I like:
Still boastful hop aroma despite quite a few months of age. No roasty/hop clash at all. Very refreshing for a 8.7% beer, it drinks very, very easily. Rather complex hop profile, reaching towards citrus, piney and woodsy territories. No stickiness in the body. No overly agressive bitterness, focused on aromas.

Smell is reminiscent of Arrogant Bastard, but with the roasted overtones of the dark malt.  Flavor is hops obviously (Stones specialty)- but with a rich chocolate malt background that is missing in the bastard series, or ruination series.  Bottle was 8 months old when I had it, and I guess it would age well, as that is the suggestion.  Im not sure I would consider this an aging beer (of course, I never keep any around long enough to officially call them ""cellared"").

The head is toffee coloured,  frothy, and I like how long it lasted in my Stone IPA glass. This beer shows aromas of fresh hop flowers, coffee beans, vanilla, grapefruit, and some smokey, dark chocolate. The flavour profile is uniquely Stones. Theres a hop/grapefruit/citrus component leading into a porter like dark chocolate/coffee middle. It is also quite roasty with just a small amount of toffee sweetness towards the end.

Pours nearly black with just a touch of garnet highlight, near the stem of the glass, and a dense, creamy, pitted tan head that leaves sticky lace behind. Very pretty. The nose is a total disconnect from the appearance: a solid hop front (citric and piny hops) are layered over solid chocolate and roasted malt notes. Medium-bodied with a thin creaminess, transitioning to a dry, almost woody, bitter hopped finish that lingers for quite a while. A nice balance of pine and citrus over a solid malt backbone. Its difficult to pull out any discernible malt ""flavors"" behind the hop notes, but the malt does contribute significantly towards body and balance.

The malts, however, are dark, rich chocolaty malts that battle for your tongues attention in the war that is going on in this bottle. The aroma is a fairly typical yeasty dark ale type aroma.

Fairly mild and unusual aroma, featuring notes of dark toffee and roasty, sweet malts, even some faint cocoa, along with juicy, fresh pineapple, orange, raspberry and doughy black bread.  Deep, dark brown in color with mahogany highlights and a fine, thin, subsiding head.  Flavor profile reflects a far greater amount of hops than indicated by the nose, with a lasting, pronounced bitterness and citric character, combining with the darkly toasted, sugary malts, finishing with a light amount of raisin and chocolate to go along with the persistent, earthy hop presence and slight peppery alcohol that creeps in late.  Semi-dry, prickly and well-carbonated on the palate with a full body.

How: 22oz bomber, 3 months old.  Thanks to dmac621.  A HUGE MEGA thanks for this one.
The look: Dark burgundy body with a rather big tan head
In long: Superb nose of citrus, dark fruits, pine-tree and roastiness.  This is a tasty beer.  As roasted as it is fruity.  Dates, blueberries, dark grapes and sweet jam on top of a chocolate cake with everything swimming in citrus juice and a lot of molasses.  Then comes the complex hops profile that is grapefruit, citrus, pine-tree, floral and grassy.  Round and flavourful bitterness of medium intensity.  Tasty but never aggressive.  More roastiness develops as the beer warms up.  Creamy body and smooth carbonation.  Perfectly balanced.  Very light alcohol presence.  Im very much into that new India Dark Ale trend and this one is my favourite so far.  The traditional world of IPA used to be dominated by paler ales so this beer appears like the Tiger Woods in the mostly-white PGA.

Aroma: bright hops, mixed with rich, dark malt...ripe fruit melds with cocoa and coffee tones...interesting, to say the least...and I like it!

In the taste, big hop smack, taking a dark turn, feeling hot, roasted, and full. Tangy, twangy, tingly hops, meet roasted malt...overloaded with character and confidence. Some trickles of molasses and a hint of spice linger in as well...hops are everywhere, this is in IPA territory, definitely, but those dark malts take somewhere else entirely...and I like that!

3962,"2008-01-14",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2008 Bottle. Dark, translucent body with rapidly accumulating tan head. Aroma pretty much just piney hops, not much else going on, and even the pine sort of took a back seat to mere bitterness. Flavor was also one-dimensional for the most part, but at least it was a stronger, more pleasing one dimension than the nose. As it warmed, some malt poked through, but by that time the nice hops were less of a factor and it still didnt really come together. For a clearly IPA-based beer, I actually thought the palate was the only saving grace here, really filling the mouth with as much of that hop presence as it could, strong but not out-of-place carbonation, no thinness at all. Aside from that though, not much going on.  Wasnt bad to drink, but I wouldnt go for it again. 5-4-6-5-12 Rerate 7/5/08 So I did go for it again, and the age has really smoothed things out. In the nose, some piney and citrus hops work beautifully with roasted malt light on the roast, heavy on sweet fruitiness that blends with the hops. Flavor just brings out further intriguing complexities of the dark IPA with fairly sweet chocolate, a tart fruity coffee finish joining the rest. Easy drinking, at times creamy on the way down. Very nice.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
3962,"2008-01-13",2.7,"Deep dark brown coloured body with a super dense tan head. Neat looking, almost 100% opaque - but that didnt look like it would be when I was pouring it. Aroma of super strong hops, potent citrus & piney hops with a bit of alcohol, malt, yeast, spruce and even a slight touch of roasted coffee. Medium-bodied; Very mild taste of hops up front with hardly anything else. Some nuts and coffee show near the end, but not much else. Aftertaste shows more hops than anything else - a bit of underbalanced malt and some light bitter tastes, but thats about it. Overall, way overrated and probably not even worth sampling. This doesnt fit a style aside from ASA - its overly hopped (almost all stone beers are), under malted and under flavoured. Pass on this one, if you can bring yourself to do it.

I have had this bottle for a while.  After finding out it is not likely to age well I cracked it open.  Im glad I did.  It seems to have lost just a little bit based on previous ratings but was still excellent.  If this were not a one time release that is not likely to survive more than another year I would buy more.  Pick it up in the near future if you can and try it fresh.
Aroma / Appearance - A two finger head toned beige surged from the bottle then slowly settled.  The body underneath was stoutlike in it fluidity and darkness.
Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel felt like a black and tan.  Plum, chocolate and pine resin played against each other to see which would stand out the most.  A lingering bitterness stuck around long after the other flavors had faded.  Sticking tenaciously to the throat it took quite a while to subside.

3962,"2007-12-30",4.0,"Pours a very dark brown with a reddish tint when held to the light. Dense but thinnish, brownish head. Smells like an IPA with some spicy citrus and grass notes. There is a bit of a different kind of sweetness to the nose. I taste everything youd expect from a good DiPa. Lots of hops and that citrusy bitterness but again, there is something different that hits me in the back of the roof of the mouth. Kind of a malty sweetness that lingers on the finish.
Surprisingly thin and watery smooth. Not that watery is a bad thing just thinner than expected. Coats the mouth a bit. Pretty damn good brew, and Im very glad to have a black IPA at my disposal now rather than the Port/Liars Club Black Lie that seemed to be only available on tap.","San Diego, California, USA","doubleo"

Not sure if it was top vs bottom or snifter vs trappist, but the snifter version was more IIPA like, while the trappist was more Imp Stout like. I was expecting this to be dark, but it was darn near pitch black. Good lacing. Aroma: Grapefruit & earthy/sprucy hops; Dark malts underlying, but they dont jump out at you. Taste: Silky dark malts hit you right away, which are soon pushed aside by citrusy hops. Then in the finish, the malt bitterness and the hop bitterness blend seamlessly together for a very nice effect. In the trappist glass, the malts come through much more in the aroma & finish. It finishes w/ a nice chalky bitter chocolate/coffee combo. The trappist part seemed a bit smoother too, not surprisingly. All in all, I think I preferred the bottom/trappist part.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","ketchepillar"

The aroma is is filled with grapefruity hops that dominate pretty much every Stone beers nose.  The flavor is quite interesting.  There is a lot of hop bitterness with the citrusy floral notes of the hops being the most prominent flavor, but there is also the sweet, complex, and rich chocolate and roasty malt flavors balancing in the background.

3962,"2007-11-17",3.4,"Thanks to Styles for the 22 ounce bottle.  This one pours a deep brown mahogany color with a reddish-ruby edge when held up to the light.  Sitting atop the body is a beige head of creamy foam, lasting quite a while and settling down to oily lace which lasts to the bottom of the glass.  The nose is earthy at the onset, but upon further inspection pine resin and grapefruit hop aromas waft upward from the glass.  After allowing the much anticipated elixir to settle quietly in the glass, the first sampling reveals a multitude of flavors.  Up front the rich and earthy characteristics from the base malts dominate with flavors of dark roast, bittersweet chocolate and some espresso.  In the middle, the flavors become a bit muddled as caramel sweetness, peppery spices and hop bitterness compete for attention.  As the flavors begin to fade, a warming alcoholic presence is noted.   Rounding out the taste sensation is a creamy smooth, almost oily mouth-feel with mild carbonation.   Of the black IPAs Ive had the pleasure of trying in the past six months, the Hoppin Frog Bodacious Black and Tan stands out as the best so far.

I didnt get much in the way of roasted/harsh/burnt notes or twangy dark malt notes that I would have expected, and perhaps that was the point.

Cant say that I really care for the flavor though.  The heavy handed piney hops hops dont meld too well with the nutty roasted dry malts.  Id like some sweetness to balance this out.

3962,"2007-11-08",4.1,"22oz Bomber

September 2007

Recieved from the excellent trader known as errantnight. Thanks for looking out Derek. A black IPA? This should be interesting. Stones 11th Anniversary pours black with some faint garnet highlights along the bottom and up the sides of the glass. A two finger beige head formed on the pour that does not disappear. This head sticks around throughout the glass and leaves big sticky patches as the beer disappears. Really good looking brew.

The nose starts, continues, and ends in hoppy goodness. Theres not a whole lot of malt coming through but what does comes in the form of sweet caramel. Theres also hints of caramalized-to-slightly-scorched sugar in there. Who cares about the malt right? The hops are where its at with this beer. Brown sugar coated grapefruit pushes through quickly and leads throughout. My mouth waters as I smell this beer.

This beer tastes just like brown sugar coated grapefruit from the second it hits the tongue till the swallow. That sweet caramel and lightly scorched sugar trys to work through the grapefruit but falls far short. As a matter of fact this beer tastes identical to the way it smells. This beer will do a number on the tongue. You will be numb by the end of a bomber...After this beer gets closer to maybe 55 a mild bittersweet chocolate character comes through that adds a nice depth.

Medium body with a light creamy mouthfeel. I cant believe the weight (or lack there of) of a beer with this high an abv. Good lingering bitterness on the swallow sticks around until the next sip.

This beer is going down far to easy and far to quickly. Amazingly easy to drink for a high abv like this beer has. I would only drink one bomber at a time for the simple fact that your tongue takes a beating and Id feel like I wouldnt getthe most out of the second bomber.

Another great beer from Stone. I dont think these guys do anything wrong. A black IPA is a cool concept that I hope to see again in the future. Keep it up over there at Stone. I have yet to not be crazy about any of your brews.

Really good.

Original rating (it was early in my rating career): Clearly I didnt like it.  Ive had three bombers just to be sure.

The middle flavor was a great, fullmouthed rush of hops, but not overwhelming. Just a pinch of coffee underpins the hops. After swallowing, I could feel the hops flavor ebb and flow not unlike distant cannonfire, while a faint frothy cream lingered on the back of my tongue. Overall, this beer is really damn good. Surprisingly, it doesnt taste as strong as the 8.2% alcohol, but boy did I feel it after drinking the whole bomber.","Ft. Collins, Colorado, USA","NephrenKa"
3962,"2007-11-03",3.8,"The aroma was more malty than hoppy.  Doesnt quite pass the 60 watt test, theres a bit of light that creeps through, being a really dark amber with a nice thick light head.   I didnt taste the citrus they say is in it, but it might be my palate.  I did get quite a bit of sweet roasted flavors, followed by bitterness on the back of my tongue.  This was a nice beer to drink and a chilly, rainy night in New England.","EL SALVADOR","PeterA"
3962,"2007-11-03",3.2,"UPDATED: NOV 4, 2007 Draught tulip at Sunset Grill on 10/6/07A clear mahogany-chestnut brown, with plentiful large bubbles in the liquid and a foamy beige head that shows moderate retention, light lacing.Very fruity nose, with obvious amarillo dominance, which is nice, but as TAR so elegantly notes, it dosent end quite as pleasantly, with tacky, sticky, nose and palate-dulling resin.  Just unnecessary, and all it needs is the amarillo hop notes, without all the simcoe bitterness.  Chocolate and biscuit malts sort of scratch at the nose, though some stickiness and base malt sugars do keep it fairly substantial.  Gets rather peachy-bready on the finish, and conjures up memories of Avery 14....But if you focus on the chocolate and caramel notes and the interesting fruitiness up front, its passable.  No flaws, light alcohol warmth, medium to medium-high strength of aroma.Sweet and sticky, with gooey caramel sticking all over the palate.  Flakes of dry chocolate are added to this and lush, tropical fruits emanate from the hops, growing juicier, to the point of fatigue, on the finsh.  Bitterness is never a problem, but it just seems too peachy-sweet and gooey, for lack of a more elegant description.  Roast courses through, but combines with a minty hoppiness that just dosent work, in my opinion, showing too much stark, dry contrast to the sweet caramel.  Phenolic as well (black pepper).  Carbonation is moderate and some butteriness is apparent on the end (not diacetyl) with light alcohol warmth.  Eh, its certainly a step up from Avery 14, but I was far from enamoured.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

There are some faint suggestions of bread and honey mixed in there, but this is a hopheads brew.  As it warms, balance appears, allowing a stronger malt profile to emerge.  Reminds of pumpernickel bread or a dash of mocha.  Strong as it leaves the mouth with a lasting bitter finish.","","User57106"

3962,"2007-10-31",3.4,"Dark chestnut. Clingy khaki head deposits patchy lace as the head retreats. Good retention. Mango, resin, mandarin orange, and chocolate pudding fill the nose. Hints of grass, spruce, black currants, dark berries and gluey yeast. Tight creaminess graces the palate. Bottle conditioned. Juicy from the get-go with a well-integrated assault of bitter hop oils and succulent hop flavors reminiscent of pineapple, mango, and assorted citrus (peach, orange, grapefruit). Malt reveals a silky chocolate quality as well as a tinge of biscuity sweetness. Fairly fluffy and defined, as well, yet lends a lovely cottony coarseness to contrast with the juicy hop character. Medium dryness displaces a small portion of the oppressive resins, but, as do the gluey yeast remnants, they still happen to impart too much gooey weight which obscures the more-nuanced hop derivatives. Esters evoke thoughts of plums, black licorice and fresh peaches. Hops flash a fresh dankness, but quickly succumb to the resins. Finishes with an integration of minty alcohol and spicy sprucelike hops which augment the dryness. Roasty bitterness kisses the lingering resins to amplify the spiciness, but an unpleasant aspirinlike astringency remains. Not too shabby, as a whole. Its just  unfortunate that the gluey yeast and resins tarnish what would otherwise be a bright and clean aroma and flavor. Solid mouthfeel and appearance. Fairly enjoyable.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

The flavour is spicier and deeper, with pine mingling with the citrus, some roastier malt, and dark fruit.

3962,"2007-10-23",4.5,"22 oz bomber - oh man, I cant believe I stumbled across a bottle of this in Michigan recently.  A true coup for me.  Anyway, the beer pours a gorgeous dark dark brown, just a shade lighter than black, with some ruby highlights at the edges of the glass.  A huge rocky crown sits atop the glorious liquid and leaves a thick layer of lace on the inside of the glass.  Massive pine and citrus notes in the aroma - very fresh seeming, like smelling a Christmas tree.  Nothing subtle here.  There is also a sour layer in there and, unlike some of Stones other big beers, a surprisingly good amount of malt.  Mmmmmm, I just cant stop smelling this.  Big hops to start in the mouth, but again, probably a massive amount of malted barley to keep it this (surprisingly) balanced.  Not to say that it is some subtle British mild - everything about this beer is stupidly over the top and I love it.  Long bitter finish that comes and goes in waves, but theres a sweetness in there too from all that malt, and a sort of dry chocolaty character as well.  Alcohol comes in a bit in the mid-palate, but is very well-integrated.  I felt like the enamel was being stripped from my teeth while drinking this.

Its hard to tell if that bitterness is just from hops, or if its a malt issue.  Smoky, but a bit more like ash and charcoal than smoked malt.  Sweetness is knocked out quick with the bitterness.  Mouthfeel is silky smooth and dense.  Big alcohol burn all over the mouth.  Stone has not been hiding the alcohol well, particularly on the anniversary beers.  Mouthfeel: check.  Complexity: moderate.  Balance: lacking.  Alcohol burn: present and accounted for.  A noble experiment, but not much of a crafted beer.

Lying underneath the hops is a bit of sweet toasty bread and honey.  The flavor is interesting, with notes of roasted coffee and chocolate backing up a strong IPA-like hoppiness with predominantly piney and grassy flavors, with perhaps a touch of citrus.  A reasonable cross between some sort of malty ASA or perhaps even a stout witih an IPA. However, Im not sure the flavors are sharing a synergistic relationship.  Theyre decent together, but might have been better separate, and perhaps might even be getting in the way of each other.  A decent idea that was well-made, but almost a bit too much contrast for this to be amongst my favorite Stone brews.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

3962,"2007-10-21",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 5, 2010 My Bottom Line:
Earthy, wooden and citrusy hops proliferate atop the delicate roasted malts in this highly flavorful and quenching strong Black IPA. This is just another high quality Stone offering.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam decorates the brown-sleeved black.
-The blackness in this IPA is more a visual treat than an important contributor to the flavor profile.
-Carbonation is frothy and comfy, increasing drinkability.
-Alcohol does not really appear in the flavor profile.
-Roasted malts and resinous hops lend plenty of bitterness to the finish.
-Caramel sweetness is well integrated, but does not quite balance out the hoppiness in a young bottle.

I was thinking de-husked carafa or chocolate malt before reading the description - I guess thats pretty close to what we have here. Definitely not bitter dark malts, no roasted barley.  The citrus qualities make this a bit like a fruit flavored chocolate, in the best ways.  Chinook and Amarillo are pretty apparent,  I wouldnt have guessed Simcoe though.  The signature simcoe citrus grapefruit blends interestingly with the darker malts.   The finish is pretty smooth, I think they had pretty good attenuation on this one.  The slight hot alcohol will probably improve with age, as well as the melding of hop profile with the darker malts.  Id like to see Stone do this IPA with a British IPA hop strategy in the bittering and a little Stone touch in the  finish.  I couldnt drink this every day, but it was tasty.","Oakland, California, USA","nahthan"

3962,"2007-10-20",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2007 Bottle poured into a trappist glass; poured a dark brown with a nice sized light brown head.  Aroma was very nice; alot of citrus and grapefruit; also some toffee, pine and melon.  Well done and interesting concept.  Well balanced between the citrus/pine finish and the darker roasted elements.  One thing that lessened my rating was the dark and malt elements of the beer faded away as the citrus and pine became more assertive.  Hop bitterness was strong and good.  All in all it is a very good beer.","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"
3962,"2007-10-20",4.0,"Bottle via trade with Jake65. Loads and loads of pine on the nose. Tangerine and mango. Very one sided. Not a lot of malt but, damn, I sure like it! Pours rich, deep, dark brown, almost black with some mahogany attempting to shine through. Frothy, rich, ruby off-white head. Bountiful citrus and pine on the palate. Pleasantly bitter with some malt to balance. Mildly floral as well. Full bodied and creamy on the palate. Very nice stuff! Thanks Jake!","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
3962,"2007-10-19",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 31, 2009 Bomber. Pours a really dark ruby color that basically looks black in normal light. A good tan head builds up then fades away to a small topping. I take a whiff, this stuff smells  friggin awesome. Ive had a few IPAs lately, trying to find this kind of aroma. Its bright and very well defined with juicy citrus, not quite grapefruit, biting pine, and melon. There is a bit of sweetness in there too, but I cant get anything definite through the delightful hoppy notes. After taking a sip, I decide this stuff tastes amazing in a surprisingly different way. I get many sweeter, breadier flavors that I couldnt find any real traces of in the aroma. I get berries, a bit of chocolate, oak, biscuits, and of course, more drying, sappy, spicy notes of pine , ganja, and citrus. The malts are fairly hearty but not roasty enough to make me think porter or stout, even though this sure as hell looks like one. This reminds me of Arrogant Bastard but with much  more complexity in both the malt and hop qualities, and without necessarily being more intense. Stone definitely has a theme in the majority of their ales. They are a brewery that is so proficient in making robust American-styled ales, that they dont suffer, in my opinion, from not branching out. This is in the same vein as AB or their IPA, but its just slightly different. This is completely solid in its own right and is another welcome offering.

Pours dark, near black actually. This is super hoppy and clean with defined pine and grapefruit. Pretty much signature Stone in the aroma. This is a bitter beer with huge hops everywhere, lots of herbal and citrus notes. The malty backbone is cool, clashes well with the insane hops.  This is almost roasty with bittersweet chocolate, hints at earth and wood. This is remarkably clean and hugely flavorful. This works well. It is distinctly American and distinctly Stone.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
3962,"2007-10-19",3.7,"Pours a barely transparent dark copper mahogany with a spotty-lacing tan head.  Aroma of faintly piny hoppy and slightly toasty dark caramel malt.  I expected the aroma to be hoppier but its about average for big IPAs.  Starts sweet and dark caramely malty with some grapefruity hop balance and overall pretty drinkable toward a crisp, bittersweet finish.  A nice dark IPA, but nothing that special.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3962,"2007-10-19",3.7,"22oz bottle pours out a dark brown topped with a tan head. A first all I could smell were a sweet floral hops. Then some roast. Tast of hops, roast malt and a little sweetness. Pretty good. But I think the 10th was better. I be happy to tast next years.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"
3962,"2007-10-19",3.6,"If anything, Stone suffers from its lack of an identity crisis. I was enticed by the idea of an IPA paired with dark malts, as these beers often please my palate (see Founders Black Rye). Unfortunately, the Stone ""signature"" dominates 11th Anniversary Ale, by which I mean a thick, oily body dominated by resiny, biting, citrusy and piney hops that are strong enough to make this a failed differentiation from their regular IPA products. The chocolaty, dark malt characteristics are present, but not assertive enough. Its as if Stone tried to branch out but decided to pull back and make another safe, unchallenging beer. On a positive note, the deep, translucent garnet red-brown body is a beauty. To my dismay, this elegance subsided to above-average but not intriguing upon imbibition.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
3962,"2007-10-19",3.9,"Pours dark, real dark with a foamy white head that slowly fades. This one is hoppy, no question about it.  This was quite a surprise, I had a dfh 90 minute before this and it is extremely similar, well as far as the hops go.

Pour is a hazed brown auburn with a somewhat loose two inch khaki head. Lasting head, falls with pretty lacing. Aroma is fresh orange citrus and pine hops, along with a gently roasted malt.  Fresh and clean nose.  Taste is the pine hops, along with the roast malt finishing with a pretty weird peanut shell taste and some hot booze. The after taste is dry, with notes of straw. The palate is medium bodied, though thins out at the finish, which has residual alcohol and entirely dries up the beer.

Aroma of bright pine and citrus hops, with some malty graininess in the background.  Taste features more malt than hop, though the hop shines through midway with some nice clean, bright, pine hoppiness.  The citrus hop from the nose are also present.  The after taste has a nice burnt - roast malt smokiness to it, and is very dry.  This tasted as good as I had remembered, and was a bit surprised the hop character was still as strong as it was.

Flavor:  Some roasty flavors upfront with notes of toffee, smoke, cocoa.  Hops kick in big with a bunch of citrus and mango, pine and resin, floral and light grass.  Lots of sticky bitterness.

Aroma caught me a bit off guard, roasted malt is there, not as much hop aroma as Id expect, but also an aroma of Belgian-esque candy which I did not expect from an American Strong out of Stone.  Taste was heavy, multidimensional hops.  Lemon, grapefruit, fresh grass, pine, sour orange.  Hop flavors are mellowed by the sweetness of the roasted sugary malt.  Finish is lasting hope bitterness and a little heat on the tongue.  As the beer warms a bit there is also an aroma and flavor of mint that is refreshing.

Beneath that, a mild roastiness is detected, and a bit of chocolate, but lets call a spade a spade - this is all about the bitter hop. The finish is achingly bitter, the kind that creeps up from the back corners of your mouth and tingles behind your ears. A mild warming is deep in the gullet.

Its like they hopped up an advetinus or a reall good porter, which in my book is outstanding. The flavor has alot going on, starts with carmel,chocolate, and hints pf maple, tthen the hops kick in and you geat the whole array of citrus,and hints of spruce and it finishes with a nice bitterness.All in all a must try for hop heads, as stone once again pushes the envelope in a great way....","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","beerbobWFM"

3962,"2007-10-07",4.8,"Very dark, with burgundy edges. Lasting tan head and clingy lace. Intriguing, inviting nose alludes to dark chocolate and spruce tips. Full body, but not too thick or syrupy. Nice carbonation to boot. Wonderful symphony of flavors and aromas ... rich chocolate, aromatic pine, juicy citrus, caramel, grass, maple, black licorice, dark fruit, roast ... I didnt think they would, but I found the flavors and aromas in this beer to all meld very well. Hell, even the grapefruit! A healthy amount of bitterness cleaved off the sugary-stark black patent-like sweetness. I really love how Stone pushes the envelope, and this is a perfect example ... which happened to turn out extremely great, in my opinion.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
3962,"2007-10-07",4.1,"would be great for blind tasting, as who would expect that fresh hope aroma from darkest brown with a grey tan head, but theres a little molasses and oak fragrance, and the mouth knows dark, despite the hops, which do not clash. the dark is not heavy on the roast, more bittersweet chocolate. what so impresses me is the balance here, avoiding extremes of hop and malt flavors, while the total taste with some alcohol and warming, raisin, and still the hops. clean finish.","Portland, Oregon, USA","raphael"

Taste impact is quite IPA-ish. Im puzzled because its a dark beer that tastes like IPA. Not only IPA, but possibly even the taste of an imperial IPA. Now I feel flavors of imp stout peaking thru. How confusing. Barely any carbonation in this brew. OK, this must be why its an American Strong Ale on this site. Strong alky presence in your face.

The smooth roasted malt provides a strong, heavy sweet malt base that serves as the backdrop for an overloaded pine, citrus explosion highlighted by the strong dry-hop punch at the end. It does have some fig or plum in there as well. Its hard to dig thru this drink as every layer is piled under a heap of some hop presence.","Washington, USA","19Ei8hty"

Initially, hops dominate the aroma and the malts are barely detectable.  Flavour is also very hoppy with loads of fresh pine and citrus.  There is a light milk chocolate aroma that comes up as the temperature does.  There is a bit of coffee flavour in here as well.  Further warming brings out the fruiter citrusy/juicy character of the hops.  Peppery and fairly alcoholic.  Very creamy texture with chocolate coming out a little bit as well.  Malts appear to be fairly well developed although the hops never leave IIPA territory.  Sticky and resiny with a lingering pine finish.  Nice beer.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

Lots of citrusy grapefruit and pine cone hoppiness. A hint of anise underneath. Sharp bitterness as it warms seems to stem from dark roasty malts and hops. No hint of the alcohol.

3962,"2007-10-02",4.1,"This beer is another example of a beer I cant quite seem to understand or wrap my head around, so I had to buy a few bottles before I felt confident enough I could rate it. The deep dark brown ale creates a large fluff of head that lingers around for a long period of time. I smell a light roast malt aroma along with some noticeable hops that has me interested to take a taste. As I begin to define the flavor, Ill safely say its a strange cross pollination sort of speak of lightly toasted malt and classic west coast signature hops. A truly interesting drink with originality, it is surely anniversary ale that will stand out in Stones catalog of anniversary ales.

A little of the slightly roasted malts but not enough to throw it off from the IPA that it is. Flavor was very bitter, and the malts were influenced by the roasted componant.

3962,"2007-09-30",4.3,"Got a bomber of this ""Black IPA"" as soon as it hit the shelf at the local store. Man this beer looks intense, almost intimidating. Rich dark opaque brown pour, practically black with a huge frothy tan head and killer lacing. Looks like a stout. Dominant hop aroma, familiar to Stones brews and very welcoming. Citrus fruits and fresh bitter pine. Aroma is somewhat one dimensional centered around the hops, and its an eye opener. Thick mouth feel due to a really malty body. Extremely bitter and chewy, I love it. The bitterness does get overpowering at times. At first the taste buds are subjected to fresh floral and bittering hops. Im curious as the the IBU count of this beer. After the initial hop burst a slinky and complex malt bill shakes things up. Heavy and slick the malts seem to take charge. Nice blend of roasted malt with burnt molasses and a nutty earthiness. Bitter...yes, hoppy...very much so, complex....absolutely. I give this beauty a hearty round of applause.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"

Big dark fruit and malt flavor with a perfectly balanced resin hop finish.  Very smooth overall.

Minimal lacing shows in the form of randomly placed snake-like lines of foam.  Holy pine resin, Batman!  This thing isnt even close to balanced, and I love it.  Intense piney and citrus hops flood the nose from a full arm length away.  Hops dominate this one so much, its difficult to decipher other scents.  The flavor is explosively hoppy, with pine resin and grapefruit providing ample bitter goodness.  Burnt caramel malts and toasty cereal grains try to make themselves known, but theres no mistaking the fact that they play second fiddle for this hop monster.

3962,"2007-09-29",4.0,"Bottle.  Odd thing about this is that the aroma and the appearance have nothing to do with eachother.  Im looking at this almost black body with a massive tan head, but the aromas I pick up are of pine, grapefruit and pineapple hops.  So Im a little confused on first sip as I pull back and enjoy that hops experience that is so Stone.  Reminiscent of last years model, the hops are the main focus, and I find it hard to pick up any of the malts.  Im sure that it must be roasty, but with all that hops I cant pick up on anything much.  That said, the hops are balanced nicely and never get out of control.  Different, thats for sure.

Awesome carbonation that leaps up the side of the glass.  Lots of bitter citrus in the nose and body that lends itself to grapefruit if you are so inclined.  Intense malt and hop that integrates well with citrus, and hides the alcohol extremely well.  Fairly original in its flavor profile coupled with such a  refreshing body.

Pretty inviting smelling.  The taste was very sharp, pretty big carbonation, fizzled in the mouth alot.  There was a mix of grapefruit hops, sweet cinnamon and caramel malts.

Nice.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
3962,"2007-09-28",3.5,"Dark brown with impressive light brown head formation and retention. Interesting aroma - some fairly prominent crystal malts light citric hops and a weird wet leaf/pumpkin aroma that I dont care for.  Flavor is much more in line with what Id expect. Somehow the roasted malt notes stay subdued and integrate with the bright, juicy citric hop flavors fairly well. There are problems with the citric acidity and the roast being a bit overwhelming together .This is sort of the same concept as Drakes Expedition, only the hops come through more prominently in the flavor here, although the Drakes is more drinkable. I do love this concept though. Sharply carbonated finish; a richer, creamier palate would have helped here.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","grant"

3962,"2007-09-28",3.4,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2008 Bottle from Whole Foods in Vienna, VA. Pours a cola brown with a tan head. Aroma of Fruity hops, nuts, and roast. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Initial flavor of dark malts and sap that transitions to an aggressive grapefruit and pine bitterness. Bitter finish is dry with notes of peanut shells and grapefruit rind. This tastes a little green to me. I am also not a fan of dark roast blended with aggressive bitterness. I hope this will improve with some cellar time, so that  the flavors can meld.  Now I just need to find another bottle so I can find out.   I opened one of these in June 2008, and the hop presence is still there, and the flavors have melded, improving this a bit in my book.  I am still not loving the concept of a Black IPA , but one year is better than fresh for me. I wish I had another to cellar for another year, but we do not get many cases in Nashville CASK VERSION WITH WET SIMCOE HOPS. Totally different beer and should be allowed on a beer database, but I guess Stone is not in the UK. Greg Koch was nice enough to grab me a pint. Pours dark brown with a light beige creamy head. Great fruity wet hop aroma. Medium to light bodied with a creamy texture and soft carbonation. Taste? Wow. All of the flavors melded nicely on this one. The tame malt backbone of milk chocolate and caramel really blends nicely with the mellowed hop bitterness. The finish is semi dry with subtle accents of roast. No alcohol whatsoever. Very British in character, but with a bit more texture and complexity. Outstanding beer, and one of the best ones of RBSG. Too bad this has to be buried in another rating.

Tastes initially of hops, the grapefruity kind and the underlying malt leaves some dark chocolate to go along with the quite bitter finish.  Im not huge on double IPAs but I could get used to this ""dark"" ipa thing!  The malt doesnt overshadow the hops (this thing has so much hops, i wonder what the IBU on this shit is) but it gives it the backbone it needs and adds complexity.

Underneath, the farbe malting hasnt removed any black malt astringency, although its maybe dulled it a bit.  Ashy french roast grind soaks in over the slick citrus sweetness, and fairly typical shampoo taste.  Some cola.  Quiet green apple tartness is well-placed, preceding a sweet lick of brownies with a bit of salt.  An outside touch of watermelon sugar, which is lovely.  This has the texture quality of an almost unroasted south american coffee; citrusy acidity dominates.  A leafy hint of mint and sandy dark chocolate at the finish, and a burnt espresso flowering; the density of the dark malts leaves the slightest lingering of acrid touch.  A surprisingly successful fusion of two elements, in themselves ripe with the possibility of unbelievable astringency.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
3962,"2007-09-27",4.9,"Loved this guy. It really is like a black IPA, with a great hoppy aroma, but a dark complex roasty flavor. Just a truly yummy tasty beer.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
3962,"2007-09-27",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2009 Poured from a bomber.  Pours a beautiful deep brown (black) color with a moderate tan head that slowly diminished.  Aroma of hops with underlying malts.  Slight malt flavor leads into a hop explosion in the middle that lets  out a bit of fruit flavor.  Roastiness comes out more as the beer warms.  Nice lacing and full on the palate.  Seems like it would be awesome aged for a while to balance out the hops, I will have to see if I can find another to keep.  Awesome.","Aurora, Colorado, USA","BlackForestCO"
3962,"2007-09-27",3.8,"22oz. bomber. Deep, dark brown color with a fairly large sudsy tan head that wouldnt go away. Fruity hop aroma that is heavy on the grapefruit, with a bit of stone fruit as well. A bit of sweet doughy malt in the background. Flavor starts off quite bitter, with the flavor of grapefruit pith and some pine. In the middle a bit of malt sweetness tries to emerge before being smacked back down by the hop bitterness. A touch of alcohol on the finish. Good, but just a bit too bitter for my tastes, which 2 years ago I would have said was impossible. Tastes change.","Nutley, New Jersey, USA","jimmack"
3962,"2007-09-27",3.8,"Extremely dark brown pour with a monster head.  Lots of citrus hops in the aroma with a hint of roasted malts.

3962,"2007-09-27",4.0,"Bottle. Rich garnet-brown beer with a light brown head. Big grapefruit/summer/trpical fruit aroma. Big grapefruit, slight pine, lychee and other tropical fruit flavor with backing darker malt - chocolate and coffee with caramel. LIngering pine and fruit with that darker malt. Medium body. Nice bitterness. Refreshing at first, then the other flavors and the bitterness come at you to make a nice beer.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
3962,"2007-09-27",4.8,"UPDATED: MAY 10, 2009 Pours black with brown penetrating the edges, decent head.  The aroma is an absolute bow shot of pure grapefruit, amazing.  Flavor is solidly hop oriented with grapefruit being the big note.  Faint pine emerges as it warms, along with a very faint note of roast that I might not have even noticed if I wasnt looking for it.  Malt sweetness to balance, but solidly a hop bomb.  Just fantastic, best thing Stone has dropped on us in a while.  Perhaps not as complex as others, but just awesome flavors.  RERATE:  Just had a bottle as the Sublimely Self Righteous on 5/9/09, as spectacular as I remembered it.  I bumped it up a couple of points because I truly think this deserves a spot in my to beers.  I flat love this stuff.  Thank you sir, may I have another.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
3962,"2007-09-27",4.9,"OK, First let me qualify the score: A) Im a BIG fan of Stones products and B) I love beers with Simcoe hops!  This beer is a WOW!!!  I heard/read all the hype before the release and was mildly excited.  I remembered the 10th and it was really good.  The 11th was beyond my expectations.  You open the bottle and the room fills with grapefruit/citrus aromas.  Pours black like a good stout, but make no mistake this is NO stout.  Its all IPA!  The first sip is an assault on the palate not unlike Ruination with grapefruit and citrus flavors which are explosive on the tongue.  You would expect from all these hops that the finish would be bitter and drying, but not so fast.  The roasted malts kick in which seem to subdue bitterness and leave you with a little mocha chocolate flavor.  A truly fantastic beer!  Im buying a case and trying one every few months to see how it ages or maybe they wont last that long.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","GandGKevin"

Citrus hops are very strong, probably more citrusy than any beer Ive ever smelled. Intense but nice.

3962,"2007-09-26",4.5,"Wow - Stone really outdid themselves with this one.  You crack the bottle and expect to see gold (even though you know it will be dark) and you see a porterish-looking brew with a tan head.  Aroma on this one is very fresh and sweet with citrus and pine.  Flavor has some sticky-sweet citrus and pine hops, some roasty-sweet malt and maybe some chocolate in there.  Really nice mouthfeel - sticky, but smooth.  Im just hoping to hide some from myself and try it again in 3-6 month intervals.  Awesome!","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"

3962,"2007-09-26",4.9,"Wonderful reproduction of the Stone IPA aromas. If you were to do a blind smell you wouldnt be able to decide which is which. Full of grapefruit, citrus, pine, and slightly floral. The pour is smooth and heavy. Not much head until I swirl the beer and then a tan head and all the aromas burst out. The initial and mid-flavor is 180 degrees from an IPA, smokey, carmel, chocolate with a small malty sweetness. Finally in the aftertaste you taste those wonderful hops you smelled and with their taste the bitterness also takes the field slowly dominating the malty sweetness. Their is a wonderful juxaposition between the hops/aroma and malt/flavor that will be perfect for any fall or winter evening.","San Diego, California, USA","adrenalinenova"

3962,"2007-09-26",4.4,"This is VERY dark. Really didnt expect such a dark color for an IPA, but I guess its a special recipe. Very frothy head. Aroma is of fresh hops. I can see the hops rubbed in my hands like you see Jim Koch do in those Sam Adams commercials! Niocely balanced hops in the flavor, with a bit of sweetness in the background. Body is not very heavy like a stout or porter. Not ultra thin, but just enough there to know youre not drinking something the consistency of water. Lots of hops in the aftertaste, even minutes are taking the first tastes. This is the only real flaw I could come up with. Wish it didnt last as long as it did on the tongue. Not sure Id classify this as a Strong Ale with the amount of bitterness. Could easily call this an IPA instead.","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"
3962,"2007-09-25",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2009 (Had back in the day as Stone 11th).  Rating no. 1350.  Bottle.  C-hops and caramel in the nose, lots of grapefruit and pine - delicious!  Near-pitch pour with a luscious, lacing, rocky, wiggly, creamy tanned - dark brown head - gorgeous!  Very dry (bone dry) hoppy taste, lots and lots of resin with medium bitterness; the overall effect is of smoothness rather than grit, though.  Warming in the throat from the alky, but the juice is so well-integrated, it took a while to notice.  Makes me smile like a child, big toothy grin.  Hops are key here, but caramel is also very strong (this does taste like a lot of other Stone offerings) as does a lesser note of chocolate.  Late-coming citrus well blended.  Medium body.  This is super quaffable, despite the heft; creamy, velvety texture with a very robust taste and a very dry, saliva-inducing aftertaste.  Again, this is nothing new from Stone (and I dont get all the porter nonsense, this is as much a porter as Arrogant Bastard or Ruination), but it is a winner!","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

Lots of hops in the flavor.  More citrus in nature now with more tangerine.  Little bit of roasted malts and some dry chalkyness.  Hops become more subdued as the brew warms.  Light alcohol presence but not realy noticable.  Kind of reminds me of a smoother and lighter Gonzo porter.  Finishes bitter but very clean and smooth.  A damn fine brew from Stone again!","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"

Piney and citrus hops in the aroma, with a nice wet resiny character to the pine; the malt presence is underplayed at this point, showing only mild licorice and dull caramel notes; you can get from aroma alone that this will benefit with some age behind it.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: this feels kind of tight and tannic in the mouth at first, with a sharp pine / citrus hoppiness and a very reserved malt presence; taste follows the nose; theres some watery coffee and roasted malts in there, but this just doesnt come together quite yet; the malts weak and the hops are slightly astringent; an unremarkable american strong ale.

Fresh whole hop leaf is nice and assertive. Has a great lemony fruit middle with plenty of grapefruit bitterness. The malt is present, but is just enough to supply a rich body without being sweet or full of caramel like many ASAs. This allows you to appreciate the hops without it being complete hop juice.

Taste had an excellent balance - starting out with a hops overtone and seamlessly sliding over to the malt end of the spectrum and accompanied by a pleasant, complex mouthfeel.

3962,"2007-09-22",4.2,"Pours very deep ruby-brown with a huge beige head that sticks around for awhile. Initial aroma is big citrus and pine. As the head fades the dark malt shows through, first faint chocolate then stronger toffee. The hop aromas, however, are dominant throughout. In the flavor, though, the dark malt shines: chewy toffee and caramel. Seconds after the sip the hop flavors begin to grow steadily, a lento crescendo to a delicious tart citrus coda. Both the hops and the toastiness of the beginning are present in the long finish. A very Stone-ish and very successful experiment.","Winchester, Virginia, USA","jmuhops"
3962,"2007-09-22",3.9,"This beer is one little gem I found at Whole Foods and snatched up instantly. Pours out a deep deep ruby red, almost black with a thick tan head about two fingers thick. In a second my nose is invaded by all sorts or citrus flavors, it is really kind of crazy this has the citrus elements of a highly hopped IPA but the looks of a porter or stout. However this is not a total hop bomb as there is a sweet aroma that fills the air as well. Upon first taste all you get is a huge smack of hops with grapefruit and pine charging in. However very soon after you get a slight roasted flavor almost like a porter but paired with the sweetness of a sweet or breakfast stout. This is a very good beer, I dont think this beer was meant to age though as this is an extreme hybrid of lots of hops and roasty and chocolatey malts. Good little experiment from Stone. Some people dont like Stone that much anymore but I call bullshit, they produce quality beer and this one is proof. This is honestley a beer that is a great blend of styles and unique all in its own right. Good job Stone!","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","rayg1"
3962,"2007-09-22",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 6, 2011 Labelled as Stone 11. I was curious to try this one but I managed to wait a week after buying it before diving it. Opening the bottle, I already get a huge whiff of grapefruit; the beer pours like dark cola with a modest tan head into my tulip glass. Now theres more in the aroma: still that grapefruit blast, but also some molasses and roasty notes, mostly an IIPA aroma but with maybe a slight twist. But the flavor is a long way from straight-forward IIPA. The dark malts come in strong, coupling the IPA aroma and resins with something extra, chocolate and pumpernickel. The mouthfeel is ridiculously smooth; the 8.7% is covered over entirely between the powerful hops and the dark malt and I might have called this one at 7% if I hadnt known to expect more from Stone.

Im quite impressed here, more so than I expected to be by yet another Stone IPA. This one goes in an interesting direction, and does so with far more grace than the recent Avery 14th in a somewhat similar vein. Im quite eager to see what happens to the three other bottles Ive got in the cellar as the hops start to fade. If the malts balance in without bringing on too much hop oxidation, this could be really nice with a year or two on it. 8/4/8/4/15=3.9

Oct 24 07 - I couldnt resist cracking another bottle (stone 11) to compare to the 10th anniversary. No comparison; this one is really blood great, that one was crap. This could even go 8/4/8/4/16.

March 13, 2010. Drank my last 2007 bottle of this beauty. The age has done wonderful things; aged barleywine goodness mingles with dark chocolate toffee flavors, plenty of hop zing hanging around to round it out. Spendid; certainly 4.0, maybe 4.1. Definitely worth laying a bottle or two of SSSRA down for a few years. Ill bump to 4.0.

March 6, 2011. Labeled as SSRA, approximately one year old. Spendid nose of chocolate-covered pineappele. Too much cocoa, not enough hop juice. Maybe thats my own fault for letting it sit for a year, but its more in the 3.8 range this go around.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

3962,"2007-09-22",3.1,"Pours opaque brown with a nice light tan head.  Stong hoppy nose, which almost tilts towards penicillin for me.  There are other things in there, including roasty malts.  I can see how for somebody whose nose doesnt associate that smell with penicillin it would be very interesting and alluring, but for me it was a warning bell.  In the mouth, the warning was on target.  Its not as bad as, say the Goose Island IIPA, which was undrinkable, but for me it was distracting.  I understand how people like this one, but I would take a 10th any day before this.","Seattle, Washington, USA","acertain"

Nice and strong flavor. Definitely tasted citrus, hops, and a strong roasted flavor all blended. Also think there were berries in there somewhere. All this conglomerates to a pleasant bitterness on your palate and a smile on your face followed by a pleasant warming sensation in your throat...
Consumed from a bottle so I cant comment on the color or head.
Texture was pretty thick but not stout thick. 

Fits nicely between IPA and Stout. Not the best ale to introduce your college buddies to if they prefer crap...","Massachusetts, USA","alandudeman"

The taste is quite unique with a strong malt component balanced with the bitter hop flavor to produce a taste that is original (at least to my tastebuds). The hops really explode in the finish with a taste that may ruin my tongue for the other beer I chose for tonight. Not in a bad way, mind you, just in a way that makes me wish I had another bottle of this.","Ohio, USA","thoramel"

3962,"2007-09-21",4.2,"Bomber. Black pour with a light-ish tan head that turns to a sticky film around my $1 piece of fine glassware. Aromas of lightly smokey roasted malt, tropical fruits, light pine and citrus all seem to be present...a bit of yeast and just a touch of bakers chocolate. In the flavor theres also a nice roasty malt flavor with a tinge of vinous dryness but they seem to take a bit of a back seat once the strong citrus/tropical fruit/pine hops come through...quite a whallop midway till it reaches the back giving even ground to the roasted malt character. Medium bodied with solid carbonation...starts roasty and bouces back and from resiny and bitter to roasty, somewhat dry, somewhat smokey...in the very end as the bitter hop finish dissapates the roasty character comes back and smooths it out subtly. Really nice brew which should be interesting and more than likely almost a different beer in a year...then again those hops were pretty strong.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"

Very strong flavors, lots of hops throughout.  You  can really taste the roast and the malt in the finish and aftertaste.  You can also taste a lot of citrus.

Nice balance of bitterness and sweetness in the flavor.  Bold citrus characteristic, roasty flavors.  Medium to full body with a oily/creamy mouthfeel.

3962,"2007-09-20",3.6,"From a 22oz Bottle.  Pours a very dark, mostly transparent brown color with some ruby hues and a thick layer of foamy gray-ish tan head.  Huge hop nose, bursting with leafy Chinook and catty Simcoe.  I think Im getting a hint of nutty malts, but its mainly just dank.  Medium bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel with a cutting hop edginess.  Very odd texture considering the aroma.  It has a distintly soft maltiness coupled with a harsh hop bite.  I think I might actually enjoy this a lot more with a different hop selection.  Some chewy chocolate nougat and smooth caramels rest gently on the palate, while a prickling assault of pulpy grapefruit hop pith tingles the top and sides of my mouth.  The citrus definitely overwelms the roasty flavors.  I find myself wanting to become more intimately familiar with the malt bill, but the hops, a one dimensional white grapefruit bomb, keeps interupting the introduction.  I just breathed in some of this elixir, and I now feel like somebody just tried to drown me in late winter spruce resin.  Regaining my senses, I find some gentler, more tobacco-like caramels floating in before it finishes with a final hop blow.  Well constructed, but definitely strives for polarity rather than harmony.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Poured VERY dark brown, nice cream head. This was GOOD. Truly! Sweet roasted malt taste up front. Some sort of fruity taste in the middle, and followed by hops, but not OVERLY hoppy which is usually the problem I have with IPAs...This was truly a delightful brew!","Pickerington, Ohio, USA","BeerVirgin72"

9/19/2007:  I was quite surprised when we opened up the bottle of Stone 11th Anniversary Ale and starting pouring it.  I figured it would be a lighter/golden color, but it wasnt it.  This beer is deep brown in color and is opaque in the glass as it absorbs most of the surrounding light.  The pour also creates a big, cascading, dense tan/brown-colored head that then leaves slicky, foamy lacing on the glass.  After admiring the appearance for awhile, the aroma shocked me as it was also unexpected at first (and then I read the bottle).  HOPS!  Tons of fresh hop cones with a tinge of alcohol and citrus underneath the fresh, green hoppiness.  The flavor is a dichotomy and slightly confused.  First comes the thick, dark caramel maltiness.  Then the sicky, piny hops hit.  It has a medium-full to full body and is smooth on the palate.  It isnt creamy and syrupy, but it sure coats the mouth well.  This is a BIG beer!  Its good right now, but I think this beer has the potential to be awesome in 6 months to a year or more.  Time to hunt down a few bottles for the cellar...

9/01/2009:  Stone XI 11th Anniversary Ale...  Aroma:  Wonderful caramelized maltiness with a hefty citrus hoppiness.  Appearance:  Golden brown color with a dense darge beige/ivory-colored head that is long lasting and leaves attactive lacing.  Flavor:  Really nice blend of sweet malts and bitter hops; bitterness is citrusy (grapefruit) along with some sweeter candied orange; moderate bitterness overall; really nice lightly coffee-like finish (roasty, slightly acidic, coffee bitterness) with a hint of apricot and tobacco; each drink makes you come back for another!  Palate:  Medium to mediuum-full, milky texture, extremely smooth, slightly creamy.  Overall:  This is a great dark IPA and really a definitive example of the style.

hard candy; semi-sweet chocolate syrup.  Appearance:  Jewel brown
color thats mostly opaque; no lasting foam on top.  Flavor:  Sweet
chocolate and citrus syrup/hard candy; decent bitterness that fades
off rapidly; king of a flash in the pan, but still good; more leafy

alcohol.  Palate:  Medium body; slightly sticky on the lips; silky
smooth going down; a bit low on carbonation (would really help to make
this pop again).  Overall:  Good and easy to drink, but lacking its
original complexity.

There are hints of brightness and coffee roasted sweetness that are hard to pin down.  Very enjoyable though.  The flavor is even a bit better than the aroma suggests.  A well balanced but potent flavor combination that is very well integrated.  Roasted grain with citrus hops, tons of spruce and hints of coco.

The hops pretty much over power everything else in this beer except for a little bit of sweet roasted malt, a little bit of yeasty notes, and the alcohol. Dry mouthfeel.

Some excellent lacing was left around the glass.  The beer could easily be mistaken for a stout based on appearance alone.  The aroma of the beer was made up of grapefruit, lightly roasted malts, and some faint milk chocolate.  The flavor was filled with bitting grapefruit, roasted malts, and dark fruits.  The mouthfeel was medium-boded with very light carbonation.  This beer was an interesting twist on an IPA.  The dark malts used held their own behind the large hop presence.

3962,"2007-09-15",3.4,"UPDATED: SEP 16, 2007 The color is a nice brown and i use the basic term ""brown"" intentionally as its not a shade of brown in this instance; its not ""chestnut"", its not ""burnt Sienna"", its not ""Dark Copper""; its just plain, ""brown"". The nose has some interesting depth...at first you get the background thickness of the darker malt...but softly sneaking in is this thicker, molasses-like hop essence, immediately followed by a nostril clearing alcohol heat. Once sipped though, it certainly changes shape.  Pine-sap like hops are poured over a chocolaty but slightly grainy & muddled backdrop..the bitterness clings, sharply...moving towards  the back of the throat and leaving it grasping for wetness.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"

3962,"2007-09-15",4.3,"I always look forward to the Stone anniversary beers but after reading the descriptions of this years offering I was even more eagerly anticipating this one - and it did not disappoint!  Pours a deep dark brown with glints of ruby and supports a firm medium tan head with good lacing.  Bright aroma of grapefruit and pine.  Classic Stone IPA flavor profile but with extra depth and and character.  Slight notes of smoke and milk chocolate compliment the citrusy, hoppy center.  Texture is velvety smooth and the finish is crisp and bitter.  One can only hope Greg and the rest of the Stone Gods eventually add this to the year-round releases.  Happy Anniversary Stone!!","Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA","GuilTTy"
3962,"2007-09-15",4.2,"bomber - Ah, its another Stone special release.  It pours very dark brown, which is certainly unusual for the style.  Speaking of style, I really think this one should be listed as an Imperial IPA.  The hop profile is definitely that of an IPA and its an amped of version of one.  But anyway, it has a big, light tan head that lingers and leaves some great lacing.  Theres an excellent citrus hops aroma that includes a little pine as well.  The flavor is of course very big on the hops and citrusy.  Theres some malt hiding under all that hops though to be honest I didnt pick up on it being significantly different than other Stone IPAs despite the darker color that indicates roasted malts.  Its medium to full bodied and has a long, bitter finish.  The only drawback, if I really hunted for something, was a slightly off bitter taste in the finish, but even with that its still an excellent beer.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"
3962,"2007-09-14",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 26, 2007 22. Pours black with a thin white head. Moderate lacing. Sharply piney nose--luscious. Nutty, roasty, smoky, ashy notes hit you right up front on the attack. Its a medium body with tingly carb, but the flavors take over right from the jump. Plenty of swirling flavors all over the mid-palate, lots of intense activity--all the same ones from the attack. Mid-palate does unfortunately go a fair bit hollow though. The finish settles into a big ashy wash. Not sure this is a world-beater but its pleasant enough.
Cracked another bomber of this last night (9-25-07), and this time it was properly chilled. Made all the difference. Tart, citric, refreshing, bracing--all the things it wasnt when it was a bit too warm. Evidently I need to learn how to drink beer, because I was definitely drinking this one wrong.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
3962,"2007-09-14",3.9,"A dark IPA--now this is an interesting one.  It definitely has the normal Stone hop profile, but with a definitely roasted malt undertone.  Quite a unique and interesting combination, and I think I like it.","Sammamish, Washington, USA","mreeves"
3962,"2007-09-14",4.4,"22 oz bottle.  Almost black with a large tan head that leaves some lacing once its gone down a bit.  Aroma is strong, very hoppy and citrusy like a nice IPA, but then it has a subtle roasty character to it.  Great flavor, again very bitter and hoppy, but with a subtle roasted maltiness that comes out mostly in the finish.  Interesting beer, good choice for an anniversary ale I think.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","DeweyDell"
3962,"2007-09-14",3.7,"Bomber.  Pours dark brown with a large, foamy tan head.  Aroma is earthy, resiny hops with a strong malt background.  A bit of chalkiness.  Warmer temperature reveal a fruity smell, some citrus.  I want to say there is a roasty or chocolate aroma but I think thats just a strange synaesthetic response to the appearance.  Without looking at the beer this could pass as a normal strong, balanced IPA or IIPA.   Taste is different.  Interesting and unique.  Not too bitter.  Creamy mouthfeel.  I dont even know how to describe the taste really.  Theres definitely some roastiness in the finish, though subtle.  The hops present in the aroma dont present themselves in the taste too much.  Weird beer.  This is good though.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"
3962,"2007-09-14",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2007 Bomber.  Poured a stout-like dark brown with a big frothy beige head.  Initial aroma was like a potpourri of aromatic finishing/dry hops providing tantalizing scents of peach, tangerine, pineapple and sweet tea, before settling into more piney and sassafras-like notes.  Flavor at the first sip was essentially like chewing on a pine twig--strong whole hop flavors completely blanket and saturate underlying dark toffee (approaching chocolate) malts.  After a while, however, the beer settles into what seems like a rotating swirl of flavors from earthy and malty to floral and citrusy.  Nice and full bodied but with lively carbonation as well.  This one definitely ""goes to 11."" A beautiful monster.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","sheatripper"
3962,"2007-09-14",4.7,"Pours a dark brown, large beige head.  Hops dominates the aroma.  Flavor is strong hops, but you pick up the malt afterwards which makes it a little creamier.  Fantastic beer, Stone is unbeatable.","Massachusetts, USA","phiconners"

3962,"2007-09-14",4.0,"Bomber. Ive been looking forward to this beer since last years 10th. Stone wins again. This is very similar to what I tasted a while ago at the brewery, they called it Smokin Indian, maybe 80% IPA and 20% Porter. I make that mix often now and its great. This 11th is very similar to that. Its cool because for such a dark beer, it tastes like a clean strong IPA. Its like a mix of Ruination and Porter. I like it. I bought a case and might go buy another one!","Oceanside, California, USA","ChazMania"

Aroma is pungent with hops, grapefruit, oranges and walnuts. Flavor is ripe with oranges, green cedar,  burnt toast and bittersweet chocolate; all set in a biter hops backdrop. Mouthfeel is full and creamy with light but distinct carbonation. Finish is more biter-sweet chocolate and hops. This concoction tastes (to me) like  a three-way cross between Arrogant Bastard, Ruination IPA and Smoked Porter. I love it. I may  get a case to stash away, this should age very well.

Fresh hoppy nose of pine and cedar that sit on soft waves of roasted earthiness, citrus, and hints of ripe melon.  Flavor was more of the same with loads of dark piney and fruity notes with a just touch of balancing malt sweetness.  Medium bodied, medium carbonation, dry bitter finish.

Strong pine and resinous hop aroma, with a definite malt backbone, but I cant quite make it out through the hops. Flavor fallows suit nicely with huge piny hops right upfront, then the malt fights its way through the hops to reveal a bit of dark bakers chocolate, a hint of dark berries, and then a bit of citrus towards the finish.

Sticky, fruity, resinous hops. Dark malts are here, but play a minor role to the hops. Medium to light bodied, some alcohol as I found the body to be a tad light.

3962,"2007-09-13",4.3,"Bomber from Spirits in Red Bank for $5.99.  Pours a deep dark brown, almost black in the glass, but you can see some amber highlights on the edges- nice beige lasting tight head.  Aroma is tons chinook which tends to dominate everthing, but is balanced out with some nice citrus, sappy resinous and fruity hops- chinook definitely dominates the amarillo and simcoe though which I like.  Flavor is the same- just tons of resinous harsh high cohumulone bitterness, pine and cold smokey sap.  Malt profile throughout seems like it is very light on the crystal malts, just a light sweetness throughout, but enough malt to back up the hops, yet still lets through the harsh bitterness.  Im guessing they used either carafa III or maybe even that black extract that Weyerman makes, because there is no roast of chocolate aroma or flavor, or if they are in there, they are so covered up with wet resinous chinook.  If you love chinook like I do, you willl love this beer.  So freakin smooth too.  Awesome!

3962,"2007-09-13",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2008 Pours nearly black with deep garnet highlights to the lights with a beige, mostly full, creamy-pillowy head; longevity is great and lacing is appealing.  Nose is decent and quite fragrant with noticable alcohol; notes of pine, grapefruit peel, dark chocolate, and toasted notes with a hint of smoke.  Flavor is less like an IPA then the nose would have suggested, it has more malt depth.  Pine is noticed first but filters into the background behind grapefruit and grapefruit rind, burnt caramel, and dark chocolate.  As the flavor progresses, the malts become darker and almost roasty in character and the hops keep lingering pine resins and grapefruit peel.  Palate is prickly at the start, moderately full, soft to lively, warm, and round, a bit velvety.  Palate would be perfect for an IIPA but seemed not quite enough to handle the dark malt notes.  By the finish the pine is almost cedar-like, grapefruit peel is still there, and a smoke note is found as well; also, the light roast adds to the hops and decent alcohol warmth to create a moderately high, somewhat dry bitterness.  Black IPA (or IIPA) is a great description as opposed to Imp stout or Baltic porter; the hops dont just add bitterness but plenty of complexity as they do in IIPAs.  Certainly unique and well constructed with dark malt depth and plenty of hop character.  Stone just continues to extend the boundaries of beer styles.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Head retention is superb slowly reducing to reveal a full downy canopy of thick, sticky lacing. The aroma tells the tale of a full blown IPA complete w/ generous citrus rind overtones accompanied by only mild whiffs of malt. The aroma doesnt match the color. I expected some roast component to factor in but its just not there. Im not complaining though. Its the Criss Angel mind freak show. Full nectar w/ creamy soft residual effers. Its like drinking heavy cream. Nice! Now thats what Im talkin bout. Texture goes a long way w/ me and this ones there all the way. Its mildly sweet like my third grade teacher but throws copper at you when arroused. A big roasted malty backbone supports the colony while Robo Hop hacks down the sludge walls with his electrified pole arm. As the fight ensues nuances are laid waste yet accounted for by my accute palate. Theres a defined chunky chocolate creep in the shadows that creates a diversion from the backbone and clobbers Robo Hop in the face on the way down. Nuances of molases, beef jerkey, leather, slight smoke, and grapefruit citrus rind. Could this be the ""Smoked Indian"" Ive heard about ? The finish is so well balanced w/ perfect bittering of all the decadent slop.

3962,"2007-09-01",4.1,"Sampled September 2007
Well carbonated, even a careful pour produces a five-finger thick head in my Tulip glass.  The head is a creamy light brown color and leaves spotty lacing patterns on the sides of my glass as it slowly recedes back into the beer.  The beer is an opaque, almost black color that shows brilliantly clear, chocolate brown notes around the edges.  As expected the aroma is quite hop focused.  Dominant citrus / floral hop notes mix with pine-like / menthol-esque hop aromatics.  When you dig for it, noticeable toasted malt aromatics become noticeable, but the dark malt character is certainly well masked by the hop onslaught.  Interestingly enough, even up front there seems to be a noticeable chocolate character; it is extremely subtle & I almost wonder if my eyes are trying to pull a fast one on my nose.  I dont think so though, there is a slight note of chocolate that intermingles with notes of grapefruit, freshly zested tangelo skins and lychee.  With time the sharper pine / menthol hop aromatics seem to fade a bit.  The hops here really capture the essence of freshly zested citrus peel, I almost feel like I got to close to the grater while zesting some sweet citrus fruits and ended up with a nose full of citrus oil.

The beer is served cool at about 58ºF (14ºC), this produces an almost creamy mouthfeel up front, but of course the hop character is the most noticeable aspect here.  Bracingly hoppy from the get go, towards the middle with a little malt help the sweet citrus notes become really noticeable.  The finish has a bitterness that only becomes more biting & sharp the longer the beer has been gone from my mouth; almost as if the bitterness sticks harshly to my palate while the malt character melts away.  The bitterness in the finish seems to be accentuated a bit by some dark malt derived acidity; in fact this is where the dark malt character seems to come into play.  The dark malt flavors are drowned out by the hops.  This is quite easy drinking, there is a sort of creaminess to the beer, but it is still quite quaffable if not quite light.  I would not even guess this was almost 9% alcohol, as it captures the drinkability & relatively light body of a West Coast IPA.  The citrus hop flavors are definitely the dominant flavor contributor here.  They are not quite so over the top as the aroma was (that citrus oil character is muted a bit), but still ample notes of tangelo, ruby-red grapefruit, orange zest, and lychee are quite noticeable.  As the beer warms and my palate gets used to it, subtle notes of roast coffee and chocolate start to become noticeable.

This is most definitely an IPA inspired beer; the lingering, tongue flagellating bitterness in this beer is huge.  Astringent at times, bracing, palate dominating, but thoroughly enjoyable for the hop heads out there.  I really hope this beer lasts longer than the 10th anniversary beer; for some reason that one had a 2 week window where it was a zesty hop bomb, but after that it became a train wreck of flavors (though Ill have to revisit it as some have said it has mellowed recently).  Anyway, if you only have one bottle drink it now, cause it is at its peak fresh hoppiness right now.   It will be interesting to see how the dark malt character plays out; it is very subtle right now and if this was put in a blind IPA tasting (you would actually have to be blind folded though), most would have a hard time guessing this was not a typical, albeit supper hoppy IPA.

3962,"2007-09-01",4.0,"22oz bottle from Plaza Liquors, making the first two reviews on here from the same place! 
Pours a nearly opaque very dark brown. Pours a quickly fading hefty head with good lacing.
Aroma is very intriguing and unique. The typical dry hoppy aroma with a little less citrusy factor of Stones IPAs mixed with a richly malty background.
A nice balanced flavor, mostly bitter Stone IPA married to rich complimentary roasted malts porter/stout-like character. Undertones are cloying and difficult to discern, there is a slight sweetness that may be mocha malts and black liquorice that compliment the body very well.
Mild fading aftertaste of mildly citrusy dry hops and sweetness. 
A rich robust but not too thick mouthfeel, if you concentrate really hard you can sense some alcohol but it is not overly apparant. This is a nice solid beer that is very close to being a completely new style. I like.","Arizona, USA","ragesaq"
3962,"2007-09-01",3.9,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2007 22 oz. bottle from Plaza Liquors - Pours a dark brown color with a one and a half finger thick tan head.  Nice lacing.  Has your typical IPA aromas - citrus, floral, and pine hops with only a slight hint of malt.  The flavor is only slightly more balanced.  The hops lead the way with a tad bit of roasted malt bringing up the rear.  Palate is kinda dry with a slight bitter aftertaste.  Medium body.  Alcohol is noticeable, but doesnt take anything away from the beer.  Overall, a good, enjoyable beer.","BFE, Arizona, USA","cbkschubert"
