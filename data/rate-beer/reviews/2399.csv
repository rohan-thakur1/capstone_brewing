2399,"2016-12-07",3.7,"Tap at Kamikaze. A clear deep amber with a beige head of tightly packed bubbles and nice lacing. Aroma of toasted malt with caramel and hopping. Subdued at first but emerges after a few minutes. The flavour hits straight up, a nice surprise of rich earthy malt and lightly charred caramel, a good balance with brighter piney hop notes. Good medium feel, almost too soda spritzy but with a good malty feel lingering with easy bitterness. Well put together.","Osaka, JAPAN","mrjez"

2399,"2016-08-11",4.3,"Its easy to undersell a beer like this, because its not an IPA or a bold Stout. What it is is an incredibly nice malty Amber with sweet caramel fading even into light milk chocolate while finishing mildly bitter with good citrus notes. Its actually just a fucking good beer that would be elite even in America.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"

2399,"2011-06-19",3.5,"Yen 1150 on tap at Ushi Tora. Full flavoured and plenty of fruits make this a nice deviation from the standard pedestrian style often seen in amber ales. Good layer of fizz too. Really bordering on pale ale in style given the fruit expression. Lovely beer.Earlier Rating: 6/16/2011 Total Score: 3.7Fantastic  house brew. Excellent effort with wonderful toffee malts, subtle yet meaningful grassy hops and some unexpected lift from some low key fizz. Some very attractive fruit sweetness kicks in late.

2399,"2007-08-11",4.0,"Deep mahogany amber color with grapefruits, citrusy, hoppy nose. Very hoppy for the style, but you wont hear me complain. The mouth starts incredibly hoppy then glides into sweet maltiness, still definitely hop accented. West Coast all the way. Grapefruit citrusy, mouth definitely cascade. Slightly dry hoppy finish. 

Note: This beer is known as the Aldgate Amber at the Aldgate pub in Shibuya.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
2399,"2007-08-02",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Flirting hop resins swirl around the seduced peachy caramel malts, as earthy, wooden hop flavors soon take control of the highly amusing dance. If more Amber Ales were like this one, the style might get a lot more respect from craft beer lovers.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A large, frothy head of foam bobs atop the hazy dark amber.
-Caramel malts accompany the hops into the vibrant finale.
-As someone else has said, this is indeed a convincing nod to PNW hop quencher.
-The body is well-malted, and drinkability remains the key.

2399,"2006-04-17",4.2,"12-ounce bottle left over from WBC. Wow. What an awesome beer. Big sand-colored bubbly head, gorgeous amber/garnet orange-y body. Kind of Belgian-esque on the nose, has to be the yeast, that little combination of bread and bubblegum some of the lighter B ales have. Pleasantly surprising complexity for one so mild, especially given the travel involved--sour malt on the attack with a toasty, buttery contrast. Crisp floral hop finish with some real sustain to the bitters. Absolutely a credible nod to PNW hoppy ales. Nicely done.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
