2319,"2017-04-17",4.2,"Got in a BIF from Roguer. 375 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/14/2016. Pours slightly hazy pinkish golden/orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big juicy strawberries, lightly tart lemon, green apple, raspberry, cherry, red grape, brown sugar, and toasted oak; with light hay, leather, musty funk, bourbon, pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of strawberries, malt/sugars, oak barrel, and light-moderate fruity/funky yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tart/sour raspberry, strawberry, lemon, green apple, red grape, brown sugar, and toasted oak; with light hay, leather, musty funk, bourbon, vanilla, pepper, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate fruity/lactic sourness and light yeast/oak spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of sour raspberry, strawberry, lemon, green apple, red grape, brown sugar, toasted oak, red wine vinegar, light musty funk, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, strawberries, malt/sugars, and oak barrel flavors; with a great malt/sourness balance. Lightly puckering, but not astringent after the finish. Moderate dryness from acidity/oak tannins, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately acidic/tannic/grainy balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Mildly warming alcohol for 9.7%. Overall this is an outstanding fruited sour ale! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, strawberries, malt/sugars, and oak barrel flavors; very smooth and easy to sip on for the big ABV; and despite the increasingly lactic/tannic/drying finish. Interesting contrast between aromas and flavors. Nose was very sweet and juicy on fruit notes, with much less funk/sourness; but the taste was much more in line with what I expected for a sour ale on flavor complexity. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

2319,"2017-04-10",3.9,"Poured from a 375 ml bottle dated July 14, 2016. 
Aroma is nice and fairly strawberry forward. Some cherry, and other berry notes with a bit of fig and raisin. Light oak notes with some hints of bourbon and alcohol spice. Some light caramel and toffee notes. 
Pours a slightly murky, reddish brown with a small, somewhat thin, tan head that quickly recedes and disappears. No lacing and moderate length legs. 
Flavor is fairly sweet with some moderate acidity in the finish. Medium light strawberry notes with tart cherries, berries, raisin and figs. Light caramel and toffee notes with a bit of biscuit and cracker malt notes as well. Some light oak with hints of bourbon and some light alcohol spice in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to medium high carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, one of the best strawberry beers I have had. It does not have even a hint of the weird phenolic note that so many strawberry beers get and the strawberry character is fairly well pronounced, especially in the aroma. Nice fruity notes in the acidity and the bourbon and oak notes are light and add some nice complexity in the background.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

I enjoy many types of robust beers and enjoy about any type of beer that is unique albeit I lack the acceptable terms for what it smells/tastes like. Again, Im sorry for my lack of the proper terms among true beer connoisseurs ... but this was absolutely TERRIBLE! What a terrible, fruity, sour mess. This must only be considered ""beer"" by the definition of the brewing process vs other alcoholic beverages only. It is absolutely foul and undrinkable.

The beer is light brown with subtle highlights of crimson and pink. The aroma brings a grandiose scent of strawberries soaked in alcohol. Subtle notes of oak. While the beer brings some potent flavor, the swetness of the alcohol and strawberries, a naturally sweet fruit, together is a bit overbearing. Medium bodied with moderately light carbonation. Alcohol presence is bold throughout. Mostly sweet with a touch of tartness. Overall, this was OK.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

2319,"2011-05-18",3.4,"375ml bottle with several months on it.  The pour yields a rather hazy, deep garnet colored body with a glowing amber edge that shows when backlit.  A frothy head is initially tall and rocky, slowly collapsing to a smoothed out, dense, lasting blanket with ramped up edges.  Random skinny flares and jagged paint-splatter splotches of lace mark the glass.The nose is initially a bit funky, hinting at some plastic band-aid.  After walking away from the glass for a good twenty minutes or so, however, it mostly blows off to reveal a sweet-tart, rustic, slightly earthy dark Belgian aroma.  The brown candy sugar base sports a darkly caramelized edge, working with burnt molasses and peanutty barrel wood to lend some toastiness.  Strawberries are distinct, yet mostly subdued, giving an air of red berry tartness that works nicely with dusty brett that has also crept in.  In short, if you can wait for the plastic note to dissipate, it smells pretty damn nice, but you shouldnt have to do that.Flavors are a bit different.  The brett really asserts itself, suggesting of dusty funk and even some grilled green apple, while the strawberries concentrate quite a bit more than the nose would suggest.  Caramel, blackened candy sugar, and burnt molasses are all fairly well attenuated, having been eaten up by the brett.  Sharp, twangy, sour mash bourbon shows true character of the buggy, old wood.  I thought it might get clean away from the plastic elements, but then I burped and got a mouth full of band-aid....yuck.For a brew of this magnitude, the palate comes across rather dry, sporting a lively, peppery carbonation up front, moving towards a dry, slightly oxidized finish that I actually like a great deal.  There is very little in the way of cloying sugar.Overall, Id say this beer was a great idea that unfortunately suffers a bit from quality control (or lack thereof).  The band-aid notes, while not as overt as many other infected beers that Ive had, are unforgivable nonetheless.  Its too bad, because wed be talking elite 4.0+ status if it were cleaner.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

2319,"2007-11-28",3.7,"Tap at Blind Tiger: Deep amber pour, with a fading head. The aroma has a lot of oak character. Somewhat boozy and woody, with bourbon suggestions, but no strawberries. The flavor has lots of woody and oakey flavors, with underlying dark berry notes. Later on the palate theres some toasted toffee followed by more smooth oak suggestions. A nice experiment, with an ideal amount of oak character.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"
2319,"2007-07-17",4.3,"Sample @ EBF 2/2007.  Pours a cloudy reddish-orange with an off-white head.  Aroma is strawberry and oak with some slight notes of spice and acid as well.  Taste is tart but smooth, with detectable strawberry, oak, vanilla, and other subtle characteristics.  I absolutely loved this beer and hope they begin to sell it commercially; it takes their excellent Four to another level.","North Bellmore, New York, USA","thenick"
2319,"2007-03-12",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 29, 2009 Tap at Boston EBF 2007.  Cloudy copper body topped by a small beige head.  Unless you piss in the barrels you really cant make a bad beer if you base it on the excellent Allagash Four.  Although this is the Allagash Four aged with strawberries I didnt get much, if any, strawberry flavours.  What I got was my faithful Allagash Four with an added unfocussed fruity tartness and a carbonation that seemed a bit too lively.  The drinkability was increased but it wasnt as round or deep as the original.  Still very good but something tells me that it was put together without putting much thought into it.  I mean, they even misspelled Avancée","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
2319,"2007-03-11",4.2,"EBF 07.  Pours a muddled dull dark copper with a slight lasting head.  Aroma is slightly sour with some lacto, frutiy sweetness, but kept in check with some tart quality and some oak and vanilla.  Nice full flavor with hints of strawberry, oak, vanilla, earthy phenols, spicy yeast, and a great crisp slightly tart finish.  Light sour qualities from the acids in the fruit make this much better than the original Four.  Completely different beer.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
2319,"2007-02-18",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 19, 2014 2007 draught at EBF Feb 10thDark, moderately hazy brown body has tan edges and a small dull-tan head that fades rather quickly to partial cover, leaving light lacing behind.Soft, sumptuous malts lick the nose, delivering chocolate, sweet raisins, easygoing vanilla creaminess and only a slight streak of fruitiness that can not be noted as strawberry (which most certainly fully fermented).  Oak gives a touch of zestiness, but the vinousness is very controlled, leaving a clean, smooth, Belgian yeastiness on the end.  Toffee and more chocolate-covered raisins continue to ease the nose as a hint of acids are notable on the finish, after warming.  Refreshingly dry, but extremely reserved (fitting well with the nature of the beer), it only seems to take the light prune/currant vinousness and run with it, adding just a hint of sourishness that is wrapped about dry caramel.  Medium to medium-high strength of aroma, but not forceful in any way.  Really a shame they arent going to release this.  You could really sit down with a bottle and expand your mind!  Alcohol not noted, other than some minor drying notes that are folded nicely in with the vinousness and light acidic dryness.Aroma dosent prepare for the flavor, nor does having had Four or Bourbon Four.  This is nothing like it.  Not too much like a quadruppel, but maybe sweet enough to put you in the ballpark of something like westy 12.  The yeast isnt quite as refined and isolated in the flavor, as that one, of course, and the barrel adds light molasses/caramel/vanilla notes.  But what really struck me the most is the absolute velvety softness of the texture/malt.  Medium-sweet chocolate, with light dark fruit/berry notes and soft, comforting oakiness.  Carbonation is low, allowing it to really stick to the palate, but a very light yeast tartness on the finish helps give it some balance.  All sorts of chocolates, caramels and toffees can be discerned with warming/breathing.  Sweeter than I remember four being, with less apparent alcohol and sharp esters.  Probably more a Belgian Dark Strong, but the lines blur.  8/4/8/4/172014 draught at Publick House, March 14th.Ha, had the last one over 7 years ago...wow.My review seems pretty close to my feelings on the new one.  Having not remembered what this beer was about while having it the second time, I was ready to write-off the sweetness as too much both from malt and fruit sugar, but realizing that this, after all, a Quad, it seems a little more apt.  Granted, I still think the beer is a bit too heavy on the sweet and sour aspect (with too much acetic/citric acid) but you cant just look at this as a straight Sour golden with strawberries.  Anyways, certainly still enjoyable and seems like it would be even better in 6 months to a year after some of the intensity mellows and things congeal.  8/4/8/3/15.Score is an average of both years.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
2319,"2007-02-14",3.7,"EBF 2007: Hazy brown with a loose tan head. Aroma, vanilla and caramel, some oak. Flavor, sweet and oaky, some caramel, yeast, a hint of strawberries, and bit of sourness. This did well, I wasnt a very big fan of the Four, but this was almost a completely new beer.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sliffy"
2319,"2007-02-12",3.9,"ebf 07. this beer was banging. not overly sweet or thick like a lot of quads. the oak and strawberries hooked this the fuck up. it was mellow(for a quad) but sour with a trace of strawberry.","caldwell, New Jersey, USA","hiphops"
2319,"2007-02-11",3.9,"EBF 2007 - this is one of the first beers I tried at this event - unlike some of the other barrel-aged beers these guys brought, this one was not that overpoweringly woody - the regular Four is rather sweet, but the time spent in the barrels mellowed that out quite a bit - there is a gentle tart, almost sour quality to the beer, which most certainly comes from the strawberries (which are quite present, but far in the background), but one might almost mistake it for a little brett character (since it gives the beer a slight flemish sour character) - quite dry, with the wood coming in late - Four is a rather aggressive ale, but after aging on the fruit, it has become quite delicate, with slight white wine flavor (probably also from the fruit) - quite nice.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
