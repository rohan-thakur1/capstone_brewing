This one pours a dark ruby/brown colour with some soft carbonation and little head. Smokey aroma of charcoal. The flavour in smokey malts and surprisingly a little sweet. Smooth, silky body.

Looks: Clear deep amber brown colour; Two-finger head with crumpety off-white foam which lasts for 3 minutes; Excellent sticky lacing with fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant full smoked malt which can be smelt a foot away, with well-done bacon, toast, caramel, strong cherry, red fruits, floral, molasses, bread, lemon and fresh grass. Yum!

Taste: Close to medium sweet rich malt, with potent bacon smoke, moderate ash, light soot, caramel, burnt toast, floral, molasses, earth, strong dough, lemon, medium bitter hops and grass.

Body: Close to medium body; Dry and creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: Rich maltyness in a thick background, very creamy and chewy (nice!). Smokiness is potent but not overbearing, full of nice bacon, light ashes and bit sooty. Fairly toasty with lots of caramel. Flowery with good sweetness. Earthy doughty with lemon to round. Fantastic!

Hoppiness: Floral, lemon and fresh grass in nose. Earth, floral, lemon and grass. in taste; Bitterness is fairly strong for a lasting, medium astringent meaty malty finish.

Mine de rien, ce nez est gourmand et invite à la dégustation. En bouche, la bière est souple, légère, la carbonatation est moyenne avec un alcool à peine perceptible, lamertume est équilibrée, et le final est très porté sur la tourbe et les végétaux avec une pointe de levure. Le fumé donne vraiment un goût proche du bacon, ce qui ne ravira pas les végétariens (profitez, ce sont des végétaux !)

3108,"2015-11-05",4.9,"~1 pint bottle, poured into a nonic pint at ~45 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a deep, clear garnet red, which can but barely be seen through without light on the opposite side of the glass. Forms a couple fingers of slighty-tan head, which dies to a thick ring and cap in short order. Lacing is quite present.

Smell: Heady smoke and ash greet the nose straightaway, redolent with the scent of a campsite in the fall. Greasy, charred meat aromas are also present, as if fresh out of 16+ hours in a low-temperature slow smoker. Beneath the wreath of smoke, a blend of honeyed toast and old leather form a solid malt base.

Taste: Smoked meat, of the pork belly and coldwater fish variety, fills the mouth from the first sip, wrapped in a fluffy, thick layer of campfire ash. Honey-drenched toast manifests more as the beer moves along, from an underlying support to a full partner with the dense, smoky flavor. Leather, polished wood, savory, faint white pepper, and some dark toffee also appear through the middle. The finish is all sweet toast and smoke, leaving the mouth coated and salivating for some proper barbecue.

Mouthfeel: A full-bodied lager indeed.

3108,"2015-10-11",4.0,"Uniquely exotic and more sophisticated than its critics give it credit for, this most renowned rauchbier in the world provides a distinctive and enjoyable Marzen experience featuring the classic Bamberg smokiness that defines this style. From an imported bottle, this beer pours a rich caramel brown color with a generous khaki-white foamy head, looks more like a solid marzen than most marzens I have seen, impressive appearance. The aroma gives off a strong and blunt ""smoked ham"" flavor that may be understandably off-putting to some, but this overt and overwhelming smokiness does not carry over into the flavor, which to be sure has a strong smoky element but without the meaty ham notes. Indeed, the flavor reveals an excellent interplay of smoky and classic caramel malty notes, along with some subtle cocoa in the finish. Truly, other than in the aroma, the smokiness is not overpowering and allows the classic marzen flavors to show through. A delightful culinary experience overall.","South Carolina, USA","eRock_2013"

3108,"2015-09-24",4.0,"500 ml bottle from Beervana, thanks to my lovely wife, Natalia. Pours a clear mahogany color with crimson hues and a big, beautiful creamy, lingering light-tan head which leaves a gorgeous lacing. Fantastic, superb smokey aroma with some dense bready and woody maltiness. Huge notes of smoked ham, bacon, tar, bbq sauce, roast beef, oak wood and peaty Islay single-malt whisky. Nice hints of Lapsang Souchong tea and Pumpernickel rye bread. Taste is not as heavy-driven as the aroma but its a powerhouse on its own. Bitter, and smokey, almost roasty, with very low sweetness and a soft tart touch. Smoke dominates by far, with woody maltiness and very faint hops. Massive smokey aftertaste. Similar to what you get after a BBQ with good beef pieces. Medium body, it lacks maybe a more heavy, creamy texture. It has just the right amount of carbonation. Good. Great even.

3108,"2015-09-19",3.3,"(In Bavaria from 2012 notes).
Note at the outset that, as a whole, rauch beers are not my favorites and that they too often seem to me to have too much smoke flavor. This particular version is certainly above average and great looking, but does border on too much smoke flavor. In this case, my objection is more the masking of the other flavors rather than the sheer quantity of smokiness. 

The clear brown body has a lasting tan head that leaves exceptional lacing. As suggested above, the aroma is very smokey; ominously so IMO. Fortunately, there is proportionately less smoke in the flavor and some malt and light spice shows. Still, the primary impression is more similar to smoked meat than to a typical lager.

3108,"2015-08-05",4.0,"When it comes to smoked beers or rauchbiers as theyre called in Germany, Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Märzen is probably the king of them. Ive been drinking good beer for many years but for whatever reason I never got around to this one until now. Im sorry I did because this isnt just some novelty brew, its a legitimate, well-rounded and well-crafted beer.

I poured a 500ml bottle into a nonic pint glass. There was no freshness date and it cost $4.99 ($0.30 per ounce).

Appearance: Seemingly dark brown but actually a pretty shade of mahogany. Pours to a two-finger, beige, foamy head which laces and retains well.

Smell: A meaty smoke scene; similar to that of a campfire. A hint of sweetness as well.

Taste: Theres a lot going on in this palette, which is surprising for two reasons. First of all, this is a Märzen, which is the same as an Oktoberfest lager and that style isnt known for being complex or full of flavor. Secondly, its a rauchbier and the smoke tends to override the rest of the palette. This is more than simply a smokey lager, though. Theres a nice taste of dark malts throughout the first half. Lightly confectionery-tasting and a bit nutty. Through the middle I detect a surprisingly strong chocolate presence, which becomes stronger on the finish. The smoke is noticeable right away, but it really emerges on the finish. It adds a light bitterness and a bit of astringency. It actually seems to hold all these flavors together and transition between them very well. Im impressed by how it all works together.

Drinkability: Im sure plenty of newbies might have trouble getting used to the taste of this beer, but seasoned drinkers will not. The mouthfeel isnt quite as crisp as I was expecting; it drinks more like a strong ale with a full body and slightly tepid mouthfeel. The flavors dont linger, however, which is nice. At 5.2% ABV its got enough body so that a single pint is quite satisfying.

3108,"2015-04-01",4.5,"Kolor: Mocnej herbaty. Piwo jest klarowne.
Piana: Drobnopęcherzykowa, obfita, trwała. Pięknie oblepia szkło.
Aromat: Wędzonka bukowa, zapach grilla, kiełbasy, boczku. Aromat jest przyjemny i dość intensywny. Minimalna nutka żelazista. Na teście skórnym wyłazi ewidentne żelazo.
Smak: Niska goryczka. Mocna wędzonka z domieszką krwi. Żelazo jest niestety wyraźnie wyczuwalne, ale w kombinacji z mocną wędzonką nie przeszkadza. Piwo jest pół-słodkie. Niska goryczka moim zdaniem nie kontruje tej słodyczy w wystarczającym stopniu.
Wysycenie: Średnie - w porządku.
Opakowanie: Ładna etykieta w niemieckim stylu. Minus za brak dokładnych informacji o zasypie, chmieleniu i drożdżach.

Bardzo dobry rauchbier. Jestem trochę zaskoczony obecnością żelaza w piwie. Mimo to jest to jedno z najlepszych piw dymionych jakie miałem okazję pić.

""Smoked beer ... come on, this is going to be terrible.""

Yet there I was, so I ordered one with a plate of Limburger cheese. The wooden keg in the corner provided a nice glass with a great volume of foam. Very clear beer coming from a wooden keg I was somewhat surprised. Smell is smoky, but not overly so. Surprisingly drinkable and went perfectly with the cheese, which was served with a sweet vinegar sauce and onions. It was so good I had another for dessert.

3108,"2014-09-13",4.0,"Transfer from BA review on 6-1-13-

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a reddish - copper color with a two finger billowy beige head. The head fades relatively quickly to leave some spotty lacing on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The nose is smacked with tons of big smokiness with some aromas of char. It smells of a fire and with hints of a salty aroma as well as a little bit of grass it gives an almost smoked meat like smell overall.

 Taste  While the nose was massive in smoke the taste was a little tuned down, although still nice and smoky. The taste starts out with some smoky and malty flavors mixed with a bit of a lighter fruit taste. The smoke as well as the fruit grow a bit stronger in nature and mix with some lighter grassy flavors. A bit of a almost salty meat flavor develop more toward the middle to the end and when mixed with the smoky flavors produce a smoked ham sandwich like taste with a little bit of fruit flavor. Odd, but interesting.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is medium to slightly thicker side for a brew of only 5.4 % with a carbonation level that is rather average. Both are rather nice for the style with the slightly chewier body very nicely complimenting the smoked flavors, while the moderate carbonation was great for the overall drinkability.

 Overall  Quite a tasty Rachbier with a huge smoky nose but yet rather palatable and pleasing blend of flavors beyond just smoke.","","Darkmagus82"

Not as smoky as I was expecting, to be honest. The bottle claims an ""intense smoky aroma and flavour"", but Id say its at most moderately smoky. It might very well be overwhelming or shocking to someone who wasnt expecting it, but I found it to be quite well-behaved and approachable.

3108,"2014-08-04",3.7,"Bottle, 500 ml. Pours dark reddish amber with half a finger of thick off-white head. As expected, very smokey on the nose, the smoke note being a mixture of woodsmoke and smoked meat from what I can tell, probably bacon. Beneath the pillow of smoke theres a cereal malt base and a bit of (smoked) cheesy yeast. Taste-wise, the smokey character remains but is less overpowering than before, being confined to the middle at the top of the palate alongside aforementioned cheesy yeast, making this one really taste strongly of smoked cheese. Little bit of caramel malt and a tiny fruity note of uncertain character are detectable as well to even out the main smoked body, and the aftertaste is mostly cereal following a rather dry finish. Pretty easy on the palate with minimal carbonation, a good medium body (though a little watery sometimes IMO) and a smooth texture.

3108,"2014-07-30",3.8,"Pours dark copper. The beer sports a tan head of medium size and medium-long lifetime and manages to leave a little lacing behind. The nose is mainly smoky - the kind of smoke youd expect from Black Forest ham - while notes of sweetish caramel malts are hidden underneath. The flavor pretty much follows the bouquet: sweet caramel malts overpowered by smoke, grassy hop on the mid-palate overpowered by smoke, woody flavor overpowered by smoke, leading to a meaty ham finish with a lot of smoke. I find it interesting how much I associate the flavor with ham although the beer actually tastes nothing like pork. Its just that this particular kind of smokiness is such a prominent component in both this beer and German raw ham. Just a side note. Man, this beer is smoky. The smoke almost made the creamy texture, medium body, and soft carbonation escape me. OK, obviously not everybody will like this, and the score (in my case 3.8) is even less meaningful than usual.

3108,"2014-07-16",3.9,"The most classic of the old German Rauchbiers, applying a 16th-century Bamberg production method of smoking malt over a fire of beechwood. Pale beige, irregular, not very stable foam over a clear, deep bronze colour. Extremely powerful aroma which can hardly be mistaken for anything else (except for the two other Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbiers, that is); I will never forget my first encounter with this brew and my amazement of finding smoked ham, smoked herring, smoldering ashes of beech wood, broth and charcoal in the aroma, adorned by subtle tones of sweet malt and peppery hops. Tastes begins softly malty with a mineral-like accent but is quickly overpowered by the assertive smokiness, woodiness, peatiness and meatiness, to the extent that one could even describe its main character as almost salty, a taste rarely found in any beverage... Finish adds some grassy hops, but the smokiness remains overpowering till the last gulp, utterly dry and very, very long. An acquired taste and one Ill never forget, but a delightfully old-fashioned world classic from Bavaria.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

A: Dark brown and deep ruby. No head. No visible bubbles. Excellent clarity.

S: Smells like a campfire. Very comforting and embodying of outdoors experience. I would argue, for the style, over smoked.

T: Super smokey. Great for pairing with sausage lunch. Would pair well with sauerkraut or other acidic foods. Mostly like liquid smoke.

M: When chilled, a bit awkward as the body is medium light with quite a dry finish. Much more enjoyable as the beer warms - the smoke is more appropriate as it warms.

D: Good beer for times when longing for the outdoors, childhood memories and for occassional novelty beer. Nice, nice beer. Not among the top of the smoke beers IMO. Although, having been to Geramany, the rauchbiers are much better there.

A - Dark brown with amber highlights, 2 fingers of sturdy off-white head, the head is moundy and clings to the edges of the galss.

S - Very smokey aroma, some lye soap aroma, burnt grass, smoked Canadian bacon, bbq wood smoke, smells like sweet black pepper bbq sauce.

T - Smoked bamboo stalks, smoldered grass, some sugary fruit in the background, grassy hops invade the smoke toward the finish. Some burnt caramel lies underneath the smoke. Savory smoked meats come to mind. Finishes quick with a swift but dry smokey note.

M - Lush carbonation and feel, medium to light body, dry smokey finish.

Very focused on the smoke obviously but lets the other flavors play out. The aroma is much stronger in smoke than the flavor. The aroma has more of a bbq smell, while the taste has more of a smoked grass flavor. Awesome if you like smoked beers.

3108,"2013-07-02",3.5,"Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle into a tulip.

Out of the bottle this has a dark raisin brown base color with a dark copper edge. A fluffy white head rises an inch or so up, leaving some lace down the sides of the glass as it fades.

The smokiness is very apparent in the nose. It is different than American beers that simply use smoked malts. This has a cured nature to it, almost like a spicy cured meat. At first it smells like there is something wrong with it, but the smell is beginning to grow on me. There are some light sweet malt notes underneath the smoke.

There is a moment where the flavor on the tongue is more malt than smoke, but that flavor does not last long. There is a soft bready sweetness with a gentle suggestion of dark fruits. Throughout the rest of the sip, however, the smoke really dominates, washing over the malt and controlling the flavor. It reminds me of a well-smoked meat.

The body of this beer is rather light, as it does only have a 5.4% ABV. The carbonation is appropriately smooth while still slightly crisp. There is not much in the way of residual stickiness or flavor.

This is one of my first forays into rauchbiers, and I have to say I enjoyed it. I would not drink this all of the time, but I appreciate just how different it is compared to some traditional styles.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

This is my first taste of the style and I am very surprised that nose smells just like meat! Ham or bacon. Smoky, salty, charred. Its not what I expected in the beer glass. Theres a faint underlying malt sweetness and some hop floral. Taste is a blend of smoke and full malt. Its so darn smooth for what is on the nose. The malt is deep and rich and balances the smoke and char. Little toffee, little bread and finishes with a small hop bitter and almost dry. The smoke flavor fades pretty quickly from the aftertaste and the smoke quality adds to the slight dry finish.

3108,"2013-05-17",4.6,"The first time I tried this beer was in its very original Bamberg. The city was in the midst of some local festival, with music, flowers, colours, sizzling sausages, polka dances, buxom girls carrying trays with an unbelievable amount beer ""steins"", smiley faces, red noses, and plenty of laughter. Had I not known I was in Germany, I could have sworn we had been dropped in Middle Earths Erebor. We made our way through the sea of Lederhosen without even cringing, until we finally found the brewery. And this is when I was born again. 
The beer was reddish brown, with a lovely sand-coloured head, very much as the bottled version that I took home and now, as I appreciate a new bottle. The aroma is a killer. The most heavenly smoked bacon, more specifically grün Speck. I love the spices and herbs that come with it, perhaps carraway, peppercorns and marjoram, not too pungent, always well hidden by the smoked pork. Yes, a full Franconian kitchen. In addition to the malts, that are sweet as love, the flavour is loaded with peat, smoke and wood again, and I cannot tell what type of lumber it is, but I can guarantee that it is one of the most formidable beer experiences. You should find some indications of fruits left in the cellar, the spices and that glorious smoked pork belly and all the salt that comes with it, bringing the beer to a notch up (or more) above the so many others. The hops are lost in this glorious dream of medieval carnivals and foolishness, but they come out in the bitter finish. This is an earthy, but smooth beer, perfectly balanced. I can perfectly sympathise with a moment of reckoning as one drinks it for the first time.

Nice in the fact that it is first and foremost a smoked beer, and a marzen close behind which suits the smokiness. Gives it a refreshing edge, compared to most of the more stouty smoked beer Ive tried. A light mouthfeel but suitable. Heavy smoke aromas and flavours; hickory wood chips. Small unobtrusive touch of cured deli meat; perhaps salami. Notes of leather. A great accompaniment for Oktoberfest fare and/or heavy deli sandwiches (ie: smoked blue cheese and all-out spicy salami.

Appearance: The body is a beautiful deep garnet/mahogany color that looks clear, but is dark enough to block light from passing though, the head is thick and tan with average retention, it leaves minimal lacing and a messy coating on the surface.
Aroma: Boy this is a smoked beer, the aroma is completely dominated by smoked meats, it reminds me of my clothes after a night at a campfire. Im able to pick a malt base under the smoke, but boy its hard the smoke is strong and assertive.
Taste: The smoke is prominent here with a smoked meat flavor from start to finish leaving a lingering flavor on the tongue, but the mid-taste has some light malts, some fruity esters, and light earthy hops. This is nice.

3108,"2012-11-05",1.8,"500ml Bottle from Peckhams, Glasgow (£2.75):
The strangest smelling beer I have ever had and that was my opinion without giving it a proper whiff. There was an overpowering ham aroma right off the bat and that was almost putting me off trying it. It was quite smoky and had a  little bit of wood in there once it began to open up a little. The only thing that was noticeable without really close inspection was the strong smell of cured ham and it wasnt all that pleasant.

Reddish brown to mahogany colour with an inch tall, slightly off -white head that is quite bubbly and manages to stay quite well with only a slight reduction in size over the course of a few minutes. 

A strong smoked taste to begin with, there is also some of the cured ham but thankfully it wasnt as strong as the aroma. There was a malty base to it along with some peat and wood to it. The meaty taste is one that lingers for some time after the sip and overall it was quite a strong flavoured beer and has quite a strong oak flavour to it.

Smooth and medium bodied with a strong wood feel to it. There is also a lingering meat and bitter flavour.

Not a good beer at all, this one had such a strange and unusual taste that it wasnt enjoyable at all. It was a hard one to get your head round as it basically tasted like a ham or broth and nothing like  a beer for the most part. There was a smoky flavour in there but it wasnt a beer that I liked at all.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

3108,"2012-08-25",4.3,"16.9 fl oz bottle poured into a regular glass.

A: Pours a dark burgundy color with great translucence in spite of its shade. The head is a two finger light mocha color with lowish retention, but a nice texture. Spotty patches of lacing left on the glass.

S: Holy crap, this is smoky. Admittedly, Im no bacon fan, but this definitely has a bacon vibe to it. Tons of wood, saltiness, and of course smoke come across strongly on the aroma. Wonderfully augmented by its subtle marzen sweetness from the malt.

T: Initial flavors are, of course, smoky. Lots of beechwood and bacon-y sweetness open the initial sips. Also, its not as phenolic as I feared, thankfully. The rauch profile calms down as more of the beer is imbibed, allowing its marzen roots to shine through - the way the flavor progresses gradually from rauchbier to marzen is almost masterful, as before long, the flavor profile switches to a caramely, nutty composition where the smoke only augments things. However, its a slow sipper, if only because it behooves the drinker to find differing subtleties in the flavor from sip to sip. For what its worth, its the most complex lager Ive ever had, and its balanced like a champ to boot.

M: Well textured (not too thick or too thin), with a light bittersweet dryness. Carbonation is near perfect.

O: If this was my first beer of the night, I likely would have gone ""LOL BACON SUX I NO LIEK THIS BEER"" and given it something along the lines of a 2.55 overall. Luckily, I came into this after having a few beers, and they helped smooth this out brilliantly.

Add some chocolate malt and youve got a smore.  The palate is on the thick side with some lingering stickyness that doesnt present as sweet so much as just thick or sticky.

Sadly they didnt have any of the correct glasses or steins, so I poured it into a Becks Vier glass which actually suited it well. It showed off the body and head nicely and allowed the smoky aromas to waft out.

Really is an acquired taste and my wife hates this beer (weve been to Bamberg a few times). I am not a smoked bacon guy, nor do I smoke or eat much smoked ham or cheeses, but I do like this beer.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

I hope I didnt spare myself from not having on draft there, figured to have this fresh from the brewery would be as good, and it is very good.  Appearance is surprisingly clear, dark amber, rich off white head.  Aroma of burnt wood, bacon, ash, I can only imagine how many known carcinogens Im ingesting right now.  Taste is purely classic.  Its intense without being too potent, doesnt taste like Im drinking ash, I can even get a bit of lager yeast in the flavor, along with the wood and bacon flavor.

Actually quite subtle. First and foremost, clean and light like a traditional marzen, mainly caramel and biscuit malt tastes. Smoke flavor is more accoutrement than entree. Adds an extra depth that most lagers lack. Finishes slightly dry, with a lingering smokey aftertaste like the smell of your clothing after a bonfire. Quite delicious.

3108,"2012-03-23",2.8,"Clear, dark brown body, or maybe deep amber, with a large, creamy, long-lived tan head that ends up in a nice layer and lots of lacing. Very strong aroma with plenty of smoke and camp fire, but most of all I get meat. Smoked ham, smoked sausages, cured ham, smoked pork chops and other meaty products. All good dishes, but as a beer? Moderate sweet taste with just a hint of bitterness in the finish. I also find it quite salty, but Im not sure if that taste is real, or if its just the salty smoky meaty flavours that trick me. The flavours are as powerful as the aroma, and although there are no off-flavours I cant say Im that thrilled about liquid meat. I would probably have liked it better if the smoke and the faint peaty notes were much stronger and the meat less obvious. The carbonation is too soft for such a light bodied and watery beer, and there is also a very faint metallic feel to the beer. I dont think I know of a good english antonym to ""refreshing"", but I think Ill start saying ""Schlenkerla Rauchbier Märzen"".

My first experience with Rauchbier and I had no idea of whether Id like it since Ive hear how polarizing they can be.  Well...I really loved it and am so happy to find something truly different within the somewhat restrictive brewing laws of Germany...

Poured dark with a hint of amber look and a very small head.  Naturally, the smoky smell is strong, but then one tastes it and it is decidedly lighter in body than I expected.  The smokiness is fantastic and while it is certainly noticeable, it is not overwhelming as some might say and it absolutely rocks with something like a pork knuckle.  The aftertaste is wonderful with the looming smokiness, but it never really feels like you just ate a big smoked salmon or a smoky cheese.

I have always described the taste as smoked ham or smoked gouda to those trying it for the first time, looking for a description that compares to something theyre familiar with. This is one of those beers that I have seen many different people love and hate.

Sounds unappetizing, but is really quite a nice smell, and doesnt smell like any beer Ive encountered before.  Taste of smoke doesnt hit you at first, but then it develops on your tongue and just keeps going. You smell it inside your mouth as much as taste it. Odd sensation, but nice. 
Aside for the smoke, this feels like a fairly dry stout, and after the initial palate it settles into  being just sort of an oddly flavored stout. I think that with the right food this would be a phenomenal beer, but it definitely needs that to be complete, as on its own it feels like theres a bit missing.","ISRAEL","ThreeCats"

Pours a clear dark brown with ruby highlights and a creamy beige head that recedes to a cap but sticks around forever. Smells like a brisket thats been smoking away for 14 hours. Well actually it smells more like the smoke than the brisket. I strain and maybe think I find some caramel or toffee underneath, but the smoke is powerful and hides anything else that is in there. I now understand why some people say smoked smells like bacon. The taste is rich malty and creamy with a heavy hand of smoke. There are some sweet malts in there; caramel, toffee, and maybe some brown sugar in the taste. Lightly carbonated, medium body. I would have to say this must be an acquired taste.

The flavor also has some fruity maltiness.

3108,"2011-02-20",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2016 How: Draught from a wooden cask.
Where: At the brewpub.
Appearance: Brown colour with a brown head.
Aroma: Smoke, smoked malt, sausages, ham, wood.
Body: Full body, medium carbonation.
Flavour: Smoke, burned wood, smoked malt, sausage.
Comment: Had this from bottle, draught and from the wooden cask at the brewery. The wood cask if far superior, smoother, more balanced. The bottle is a bit too unbalanced, rough. Rating is a blend between the bottle and cask. The bottle is slightly lower in score, the cask slightly higher.

Original rating: 3-2-3-2-5
Aroma: smoke. Taste: medium bitterness, light sweetness, strong smokey taste. Overall a beer that didnt suit my taste.","Huddinge, SWEDEN","AndySnow"

Pours a moderately dark copper color with an off white head. The nose brings smoke, smoke, and smoke. Smoked wood chips and a bit of char; almost meaty. The taste confirms this latter scent, as this really starts to taste like bacon thats been a tad bit overdone. Mouthfeel is nice and smoky with a pleasant finish. Considering what it is, this drinks really well.

The aroma was of a heavy smoked malt, a very light bitter hop and a moldy leathery yeast with a heavy note of smoke and meat (like a smoked ham). 

It tasted a little acidic and mildly malty and a little bitter with an intense smoky flavor from start to finish. The flavor lasted an extremely long time and all I could taste was the liquid smoke that was left behind on the taste buds. 

Mouthfeel was about half way to medium in body with a watery yet creamy texture and a soft carbonation. 

Overall a very different brew than what I am used to, it was kind of like drinking liquid smoke straight out of the bottle. I have had other Smoked Beers but none this intense.

Aromas of beechwood, smoke, malt and bacon  the flavours really strengthen on the palate with that smoky bacon crisp taste really evident  it also lasts with a very stubborn aftertaste.

Gotta upgrade my scores. Carbonation is medium. Texture is creamy. Has a nice spicy aftertaste. This is my first rauchbier. I like it. Ive never been a big fan of the marzen style.

3108,"2010-04-13",4.0,"Bottle. My first Smokebeer/Rauchbier. I was told to check out this beer if i wanted something different, and that i should expect an orgy of smoke reminding one of meat. Pours a nice ruby red/ brown color, with a tan head that looks fairly creamy, but slowly fades away and becomes more of a lacing. The aroma is very smokey and reminds me alot of smoked sausage, the smoke also reminds me of the smoke you would get from a camp fire whilst grilling marshmellows. There is also a sweet malty note in the aroma. The flavour is very smokey and reminds me a whole lot of bacon and again smoked sausage, there is also some caramely, sweet malty and woody notes aswell. The body is light to medium yet creamy in the mouth, with a medium carbonation level. Overall a quite uniqe and different beer that i like alot, especially that it reminds one/ tastes so much of meat. I imagine this would be great for a BBQ. I think will check out some more Smokebeers/Rauchbier!","Nørresundby, DENMARK","beerisgoodforu"

Aroma of brunswick stew (combination of smoked pork, corn, peas), smoked apple, wood smoke, water.  Taste is of the same aforementioned smokiness, but underlying it is a foundation of roasted malt, peat, dark chocolate, and coffee tones on the finish.  This beer is medium bodied, and its surprising how much flavor and complexity it retains given its relative thinness - yet still with a full creamy feel.

A - Dark copper and ruby. Pretty full, cream colored head.

S - Reminds me of smoked bacon or pork of some kind.

T - Follows the scent, smoked meat (specifically bacon or pork) is dominating flavor. There is a touch of woodiness that comes from the smoky flavor. The background/base of this is caramel/toffee and some roasted malt. This gives a slight sweetness that goes pretty well with the smokiness.

M - Medium body. Fairly creamy, with medium to low carbonation.

D - I had trouble with this. I think that the smokiness would get to be a bit much if I drank more than one or two in a sitting. However, one a day to day basis this would be drinkable.

Notes: I really liked the smoked meat aspect of this beer, but it seems like that would be a bit more subject on the person. I could see this going well in the summer with a barbecue or just some meat in general.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Slightly creamier than expected. Pours red-to-brown. Has a slightly salty taste, predominant taste is otherwise sweet, brown-sugarish style.

Judging by the lips, it is very, very sweet beer. Otherwise, notes of smoked fish (herring, again!) are still predominant. Maybe some chocolate, not spicy at all. Smoke basically takes all the room there is - everything else is extremely subtile. 

While it is not the best smoked beer I drank -- that title belongs to the Corps Mort, from À labri de la Tempête -- it is probably the smokiest one than I ever drank. I havent drank it with any kind of food, so its not like I can suggest anything in that department. There are better smoked beers, but if you feel like drinking a smoked beer, that one is for you.

Nothing Ive sniffed is quite like this. The flavor is simply orgasmic- anyone who cant throw massive amounts of this glorious liquid back is kidding themselves (or is a bitch).

Initial is fairly light bodied, giving good smoked malts, meaty ham, caramel and a touch of brown sugar. Sticks a light sweetness, smoked sticks moderately to the palate. Not too cloying overall, goes down quite nicely. As a fan of smoked beers, I like this and it is quite drinkable. Light bitterness on the backend, a touch of florals, run over with campfire, ham, and a touch of ash with some light caramel, toffee, and toast, largely bready with a touch of spiciness. I liked this.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Potent smoked bacon aroma with some detectable noble hops. Clear dark garnet under a thin, bubbly off-white. Meaty smoke flavour is strong and in your face at first. Once the palate recalibrates itself there is plenty of sweet base malt flavour as well as a smidgen of noble hops. Moderately salty smoke transcends, though. Medium body, moderate carbonation, moderate bitterness balances the sweetness well.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"

Really makes you want to fire up the grill and char some proteins. Color is slightly darker than most Marzens. the taste is heavy on the smoke, but the body is relatively light. Kind of throws you.

Glassy red-brown. Thick, bu tlight does pass through. Head disappears fast. Not bud but not amazing.

Initially, its a dark lager on the front of the tongue, but the smoky flavor sits on the tongue long into the aftertaste. That aftertaste is intense and improves with warmth.

Heavy too, even after emptied (but what do  the Germans make thats not meant to last a lifetime?). Pours a deep brown with a medium beige head. Aroma is indeed of smoke; it dominates, like too much artificial smoke meat seasoning. Flavor is again with the liquid smoke meat marinade, and it tricks the mind into perceiving it as meat flavor. Gets a little less offensive after a few sips. Thick, chewy mouthfeel, bubbly finish. One things for sure: There is no lack of flavor here. Its just not my kind of flavor. I love meat, and I love big ass beers, but when you combine the two it just doesnt work for me for some reason. This is one rare instance when Id actually prefer less flavor - the woodchip/smoke/beef jerky flavor specifically. I wish I could like this more but I just cant. Ill still finish the bottle though; its better than no beer at all, so no-harm no-foul. Overall, fair. My apologies to the other RBian who recommended this for me :(","California, USA","Gypsy19"

Deep chestnut brown, light tan head is thin, nice ropy lacing. The aroma is a lot of smoke. Soooo much smoke.. but this time, unlike years ago, I can go beyond and see what else this beer has to offer. Burning logs that have had a bucket of water tossed on them, lots of salt.. in fact this beer is very beef jerky. Damn! That is it! There is also an underlying fruit that may be plum? So much salt - that is really making this beer awesome for me. The flavour is immediately NOT smoke. Serious. Plums I think hit first or something similar... have I just killed my taste buds? The smoke is much more mellow on the taste. My breath, however, will tell a different story. A story that includes 3 packs of cigarettes. Notable hops hit early on as well. A milder version of liquid smoke makes an appearance finally, solid bitterness... very solid - more than I expected. Lots of malts now, almost a dull chocolate but Im drunk so who really knows what Im tasting. More fruit that is a bit different now, ash, tobacco, tons of roasted malts.. what else? kitchen sink. Light medium bodied, a bit thin on a couple of sips but other than that its smooth and soft with some lingering bitterness shadow and what Im assuming is a months worth of going to a Blues bar of smoke in my mouth. My dump tomorrow will be of epic proportion. Maybe Ill just shit out a pack of Players. Very good beer. So much beyond that overwhelming smoke aroma. A real beer exists under that blanket.

3108,"2009-07-15",3.4,"500cl. First Rauchbier, the smoky smell is phenomenal, Id rate the aroma an 11 if I could. Aroma is smoked meat, slightly woody, and a bit of alcohol. EXTREMELY aromatic. Pours out dark, orangy red when held up to light. Moderate to large head which disappears quickly. Very smooth, the smoky flavour is thick and builds with each sip, dont be fooled if the smokiness doesnt blow you away in the first mouthful. Interesting beer, I am drinking it slightly too warm and wish I let it cool down a little longer. Overall, quite good.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Listigovers"

The smell almost brought to my knees with the over powering scent of smoke, kinda the way your clothes smell after a weekend of camping, it stabs you like a knife to the nose. The sharp smoky taste hits you the second you pour this brew into your mouth, this definitely is not a smooth beer you can slam back or drink more then one in a evening. Its definitely a full bodied taste thats not watered down. I guess for its style its good, but I dont think Im a fan of the style.

3108,"2009-05-12",3.8,"1 pint .09 fl oz bottle. Really quite appealing aroma and not too overpowering on the smoky side of things, as it obviously hits you right away but doesnt take over the experience.  Some smoked meat and gouda, but not as meaty as I was expecting.  A good amount of hickory-oak fire wood, toasted cereal grains, and baked caramels.  A small, dense, Styrofoam white head on the pour, and slightly lighter bright sangria color.  Even from the first sip, this beer to me is more well-rounded than the ur-bock.  Not as much smoky dominance, and a nice balance of full malt and hop flavors.  Lighter on the body, yet still rather creamy smooth, with a little more zing in the more bitter finish.  Oak and smoky cereal grains and toast are big, with some caramels and and even some light medium fruits.  Hops are fairly earthy grass, with little bit of herbalness.

Sampling Notes:
Served chilled in goblet.
Pours a deep near-brown bronze body with a dense sort of off-white collar.
Woah, confronting aroma definately. Have to say smokey from the get go with still-burning wood and bacon hitting hard, a malty richness lingers in the background.
Reasonably lean body, moderate carbonation, sticky sort of texture. Burnt astringency dries out body quite a bit, contributing to the overall bitterness.
Decent malt body bringing some caramel, then a smack of smokiness. Wood, charcoal, cured meats, bbq marinade, burnt toast. Finish is reasonably bitter, drying smokiness that lingers for a bit.
Probably not everyones cup of tea, but its deeply complex and has a really meaty smokiness that I find really interesting and appealing.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

3108,"2009-01-14",3.5,"Drank outdoors. A beer that was drank in reverse temperature. Started around 65 ended around 35. Interesting experience. 

Pours an amber brown color similar to a brown ale. Not much head but what is there is light tan and fizzy. Nose is bacon, animal fat, and cheap gouda cheese. Taste is pretty much the same thing. This beer is not as thick, rich, complex, or delicious as its older brother. It has some merit but it comes off a bit one dimensional and that dimension is smoked animals. 

I should note that tasting warm to cold is a real eye opening experience because its easier to detect what you have lost rather than what you have gained.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
3108,"2009-01-11",3.9,"50cl bottle. Pours a dark amber brown maple syrup colored body with hints of red. Inch thick, beige, fizzy head that dissipates quickly and leaves a moderate lacing. Slightly darker in color and less laced than the urbock. Aroma is the least smoky out of the urbock and weizen, but still has that bonfire touch. This beer, in opposition, seems to have more berry fruit malts up front and the smoked character seems to balance out the malts rather than occupying most of the aroma like the urbock and weizen. No real roast smell, unlike the urbock. Flavor is sweeter than the urbock too. Initial pale malt flavors, light caramel sweet middle, and a balancing smoky finish. Still seems like the least smoke flavored out of the three. Finishes very lightly bitter, less than the urbock, but more malty sweet and a bit of a berry touch. Slightly woody and salty. Palate is medium to full, smooth, clean, and a little higher in carbonation that the other two, but not by much. Dry, but definitely the least dry of the three. Overall, if I was to introduce someone to a smoked beer, I think I would do it with this one. Its not an over the top smokiness like the weizen and its not as bitter as the urbock. I like the sweetness of this and the fact that the smoke seems to balance the malts very nicely, while still remaining pronounced. I would put this just under the urbock.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Generally speaking however this stuff moves fast enough that you will usually get a good bottle, at least this is the case in my experience. 
The smoke on the aroma here is very nice, it smells a little bit like smoked meat, with some autumnal leaf aromas along with some malty sweetness. The beer looks very nice, it has a good auburn color with a nice white head. The flavor follows the aroma very well with plenty of smoke, sometimes a bit too much smoke which causes a slight lack of balance with the lighter sweet malts, there is a overall dryness that makes this a very appealing brew.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

Aroma is bacon, honey ham, baked beans, and smoke. Much more watery on the palate compared to the Urbock with less of a punch. Taste is actually fairly light with some sweet malt in there with the barbecue flavors. Smoked malt and campfire pervade throughout. Very little in the way of balancing hops. Fairly long aftertaste of smoke, bacon water, baked beans, and ham. Pretty interesting but Im not sure if I would try it again. Perhaps my bottle is old since there is no carbonation whatsoever. But probably will stick to the Urbock nevertheless. 10/30/2008 8/3/7/3/14=3.5500mL courtesy of MrChopin. Quickly Kevin and I are realizing that the Marzen is the best of the Aecht beers.

3108,"2008-10-27",4.0,"Appearance: Pours a chestnut brown body with a thin, thinning, bubbly white head.

Smell: Bacon, though definitely top-quality bacon. You know me, I’m definitely down with the bacon.

Taste: Sweetish, rich dark caramel maltiness prior to the smoked meat flavor hitting hard and fast. There’s some dark fruits present, but, again, you gotta look long and hard past those smoked malts. Thin vein of roastiness and even woody character throughout. Never much in the way of hops or substantial bitterness though. Oh, the ham. Oh, the sweet barbecue flavors. Finishes ultimately smoke with a mouthful of cub scout campfire ashes.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-low carbonation.

Drinkability: An enjoyable beer, a smoke-minded treat even, but not one I could down on a daily basis.

3108,"2008-08-24",3.3,"Another smoke beer?  But, the one I just had from Brauerei Heller-Trum was smoked too.  Is there a perpetual fire in Bamberg or something?  I guess the onus of this review is to figure out exactly how this smoked brew differs from the other equally smoky brutes.  Through a haze of intense, eye-watering fragrance I can make out a thin, fuzzy light brown head atop a deep mahogany and bubbly beer.  The bubbles are almost imperceptible in the deep shadows of the Rauchbier Marzen.  A meathook’s worth of ham slams into the nose with a more smoked flavor than sweet.  Hammmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.  While the aroma is tolerably meaty (a lot like smelling a bag full of deli sliced ham) the taste is too strong and too raucous.  It’s just a primal oinking that mellows into a burnt and charcoaled ham flavors and, eventually, a semi-sweet barbeque aftertaste.  But that first half through is just too busy, like I’m vying for space at the only trough in the whole sty.  If you look closely, you mind find the occasional taste of clove, but this is summarily eliminated by a policing ham, honey and charcoal flavor mix.  I don’t think this is kosher.  At least its not as smoky as it could have been.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

3108,"2008-08-23",3.8,"Pours beer bottle brown with thin white head that fades to a ring, no lacing. Hard to move past the inviting smoke aroma, but caramel, figs and wet limestone accompany it. Flavor is Is all smoke at first, then a nice slightly sweet malt a bit like grilled peaches and caramel, but very faint. Then more smoke, thicker this time reminds me of smoked sturgeon, sounds bad for a drink, but somehow it works-wonderfully. A very sudden bitter smokey hops finish that lasts and really is unique in my experience. This is only the third smoke beer I have tried but definitely the best!  I have really developed a terrible hunger for smoked salmon while writing this.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

3108,"2008-08-22",4.3,"When I was growing up, there was a point where we had an outside smoker at home. It was great. We would smoke a small turkey during thanksgiving, and year-round we would smoke fresh caught fish. I also grew up deep sea fishing and certain fish were simply divine when smoked versus cooked. Add to that my love of smoked salmon, cheese, and a variety of other things, to know there was a smoked beer style; I simple had to find me one to try.

The Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen is one of the most classic examples of a rauchbier, aka, a smoked beer. With great anticipation and love, I pour her dark soil brown body into my glass. Slightly opaque yet clear enough for light to shine through and show off her beautifully rich smoky brown curves. A soft head fades into a thin ring around my glass as I lift her up for a whiff of the nose. Rich, woodsy, sweet and smoky, like I had just stepped outside to check on our smoker and the delectable contents within. As I swirl and quaff my Schlenkerla Rauchbier, fine trails of Brussels lace trickle down the side. For such delicate smoke intensity in the palate, the body is refreshingly light and does not weight the beer down at all. Later on I detect a hint of caramel malts in with the still woodsy aroma and palate reminiscent of cedar. A bit of a bite in the back reminds me that there are still hops present in this beer as they also add a slightly resinous oily texture to the overall body. I finish my Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen with a flourish of smoky campfire and woodsy aromas and flavor.

I couldn’t be more pleased or impressed with this stellar example of a Rauchbier. Granted it is the first I have had the privilege to try, but it will most certainly not be the last. Anyone who is a fan of anything smoked will love this beer.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Had decent carbonation, medium mouth feel, and a long smooth finish.  This is a very unique and tasty beer.  The smokiness is not overwhelming, it plays with the other flavors well and has complexity.

Bottle brown, 500 ml
Appearance: Pours amber red to violet with brown shades, carbonation of the body is initially lively but more like reminding a fizzy drink and body quickly decarbonates. Head is initially small to medium, decreasing and finally disappearing after about 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Head is fizzy, grey in colour, unstable, bubbly.
Aroma: Nice intense and focused aroma of strongly smoked malt. This aroma is dominating over the other additional accents of sweetness of a Märzen like beer lying somewhere at the background. Hard to distinguish in terms of hoppyness as the hoppy aroma is violated by smoke. No alcohol present.
Flavour: Nice focused smokyness, a bit wattery. Soft front but that only makes the beer lighter and invites you to the easy going drinking. Really superior Smoked beer as compared to ’Nessie Whisky Malt Red Beer’. Finish is sandy, slightly bitter and slightly salty on palate with notes of smoked meat. Very good with red meat dishes, veal.
Palate: Body is medium, texture is wattery, carbonation on palate is soft, finish feel is smoky, ashy, gently chalky.","Zawiercie/Sosnowiec, POLAND","sirPino"

The flavor is strange; definitely dominated by wood smoke and roasted malt with an almost metallic undertone.  The flavor is weird because it is potent but at the same time pretty subtle, because of the brews very light and watery mouth feel.  The is no hint of alcohol on the flavor.

When Im in the mood for a Rauchbier I usually reach for Schlenkerlas Marzen. Pours a beautiful chestnut brown with ribbons of mahogany when backlit. Tiny streams of carbonation rise to the surface as theres tiny sediment suspended throughout. A one finger beige head formed on the pour and rather quickly fell to a solid cap. No lacing was left after the head fell but each sip did leave some decent lacing.

The aroma is that of a good hardwood smoked bacon. Theres a strong presence of smoke once your nose is stuck in the glass but there is a solid caramel and fresh grain base that reminds you youre smelling beer and not breakfast.

While the smokiness is certainly there and in your face its tastefully done without being overwhelming. The initial flavor of smoked bacon is upfront but quickly levels out to include a caramel sweetness mid-palate and a a clean graininess toward the finish. Its hard to believe but this beer, even with all the smoke, is fragile. All the flavors come together without one outdoing the other. 

I do really enjoy the mouthfeel of this beer. Seems to have a moderate body but the carbonation creates an incredibly smooth creamy finish. This beer just glides through my mouth effortlessly.

This is a beer I find myself in the mood for every now and then but its best enjoyed with certain types of food. Smoked salmon is a great choice. That said one in a sitting is enough for me but that one bottle goes down pretty easy.

Like I said earlier, if Im in the mood for something a little off the beaten path this is what I pick up. One of the world class rauchbiers.

Bottle in a side by side with Schlenkerla Urbock. The pour is a cloudy dark red with a tall off white head. Ah, theres the familiar smoky, meaty aroma. Of course, both of these bad boy are among the smokiest of beers Ive ever encountered. This one seems to lead more towards a sharper nose, like bacon with plenty of genuine smoke hitting my nostrils. Its like standing over a campfire, allowing the clouds to waft directly into my olfactory glands. The mouthfeel is reasonable and fairly carbonated, just a hair lighter than the urbock. Again, sharp, defined, and delightful smoky qualities tantalize my palate. Lots of bacon, campfire, and cigars are noted. There is no real indication that this beer was intended to be a marzen. This is 100% about the smoke. I search high and low for more smoked brews but Schlenkerla continues to prove its dominance in the style. Nothing else even touches the intensity here.

[December 20, 2010]

Brauerei Heller is the undisputed champion of smoked beers. The hardest part for me is to actually pick a favorite one. The marzen, eiche, fastenbier, and urbock are all contenders. It is hard to find one negative thing to say about these truly beautiful creations. They are all very subtly different from one another while still maintaining a nearly identical, powerful and unmatched smokiness. The marzen may be one of my preferred because of its lack of any character to get in the way of the magnificent smoked qualities. The sparse and accessible canvas of a marzen is enough to really hit home the smoky goodness.

3108,"2007-11-02",5.0,"UPDATED: OCT 12, 2010 Wooden barrels at Schlenkerla and from bottles. I thought the Urbock was my shit but after studious critical analysis, this is it. Emerges dark chestnut, nearly opaque but for the ruby tint. A big, alive, lasting and aromatic head. Pure, deep, and delicately smoked malt aromas entice. The drinkable body sells an in-your-face smokiness, which yields to a rich and rounded body. The artful fullness transcends the cheeky smoke, which never comes close to being charred. Balanced and genuinely woody, especially at the bottom of the barrel. Well-developed malt sugars are kept in check by illusory salt from the smoke and are also corrected by a skillful addition of subtle German hops. One of the most drinkable and giving beers on the planet. The lower gravity marzen goes down faster than the urbock without sacrificing a lick of pleasure, and thats why this edges ahead of its heavier sister. Begs for years of contemplation.

3108,"2007-08-17",3.3,"I had this poured into a glass from a cold bottle. I think the review would be slightly different if I waited a while for the beer to warm up and open up a littlle bit.

My first smokebeer or rauchbier to taste or review. The beer pours a very dark almost opaque brown or dark amber. There was almost no head (possibly because the bottle it came in was cold?)
It has a very smoky and woody smell and similar dark smoky taste that stays in your mouth for a while after taking a sip. It is not overwhelming though and even though it is smoky it is still somewhat lighter than I would have expected.

 A lighter body than I would have though and little bits of carbonation as well.

3108,"2007-08-13",3.5,"UPDATED: SEP 17, 2007 As we head into the summer months, the yearning for BBQ is building. Well if you are like me and live an apartment in which you have no place to BBQ, fret not apartment dwellers for the beer gods bring you Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen (It sure it is mouthful and almost ridiculous to pronounce)! For those you that have never heard of or tasted a smoke beer, it is an experience. Smoked beers get their name because they expose the malt to the intense, aromatic smoke of burning beech-wood logs. 
It actually tastes like smoked meats  seriously, it is like bottled BBQ. The beers aroma was like standing next to a BBQ smoker. The finish was refreshing and quite pleasant though. It is actually difficult to describe anything else but the strong flavor of BBQ. 
This is not a beer which I recommend anyone to buy a whole case of  matter of fact it is one of the few beers I would tell someone to have just once in a while. That being said, it is something which I wont forgot and Ill be sure to pick up some next time the BBQ blues hit me.","http://westchesterbeer.com, USA","DeadGuyFrank"

Watery dark-malt taste followed by a rich smoke & ash aftertaste with that sweetness that makes me think of salmon or sweet meat. Thin ferric hops - metallic and not pleasant.

The herby-bitter hops show up a little later to turn the glass towards a balancing act of herbal spices, smooth and earth-rich molasses, jerky, and of course the overarching heart-of-wood smoke.

This time, I had the Marzen with grilled brats on a hot summers eve, complete with spicy mustard and kraut. If Im ever going to like it, nows the time, I figured.

Unfortunately, the intense smoky aspect totally dominated the aroma, flavor and finish, to the point where I was alternating bites of Brat with sips of beer, just to get it down.

I have somewhat enjoyed beers with a smoky tint (Great Lakes Engine 20 comes to mind), but the smoke is much too dominant in this Aecht Schlenkerla line for me.

This beer has some elements of tar in the nose too.. Flavors: Wow! The taste just blew me away! (to much to discribe...) This beer is wonderful! Slightly salty and extremly drinkable. I have just drunk a outstanding beer! I just hope this smoked has a long finish, and sure enough it has! By the way, I really enjoy a good single malt (especially those with a strong peaty, smoky character).. Does this smoked beer have anything in common? Sure, this beer is very different to a peaty single malt, but I think you can compare the smoky character. I really love the smokiness, (whether in whisky or in beer...) this beer proves it! I found a new outstanding beer! I m going to buy a lot of these beers as quick as possible! This Schlenkerla was really a wonderful experience! If you loved this beer, I would recommend you to taste some single malts. If you havent yet, you should really consider tasting some (especially those from the Island of Islay) ...(for example the Lagavulin 16 years or the Laphroaig 10 years, which are excellent single malt expressions with a strong peatiness).

I decided before I even drank this one that I had to grill out while I drank it, and I can honestly say that the smell of the charcoal grill was just about the same as the smell of the beer. Amazing.  Anyway, the taste itself was of course caramelly and malty like any marzen style and the smoked flavors made for a nice, mellow, rounded finish.  I had read many times about the initial shock of trying a smoked beer so I wasnt too shocked when i actually did, just pleasantly surprised.

A pleasant, occasional experience.","Bristol, Gloucestershire, ENGLAND","downender"
3108,"2007-04-25",4.3,"Dark, clear, coppery color, the perfect hue for a marzen, with abundant foam atop, creamy, and leaving lace. Beautiful looking glass of beer.
Aroma: bacon. Big malt, sweetness, but mostly smoke, cured ham, smoked salmon, memories of meat.
This continues into the taste, and joins the palate most pleasantly. Crowds the mouth with sensation. Juicy malt, a fine marzen lies underneath, and is treated well with the smoking. 
Much milder than other rauchbiers, the smoke playing gently, its at the fore, but never too much.
Medium bodied, but fully flavored, with a mild, malty finish. Tasty.

Interestingly good.","Houston, Texas, USA","Zinister"
3108,"2007-04-21",3.1,"500ml bottle Shipped straight from the brewery to my door. Pours a brialliant deep garnet with amber around the edges. Tight creamy head with larger bubbles popping up. Upon cracking the cap, the smell of honey glazed bacon on the grill bowls you over. At first this was too strong and off putting. After the beer breathes a little the odor calms and lets some malt through, but the smoked meat remains dominant. Head  has now dissapated to a thin film that seems to want to climb up the glass and escape to freedom. Flavor is quite complex. At first your tongue and cheeks are slightly confused. Then a slight sweetness comes in followed by soy sauce, then roasted grains and a definite bite, and finally the smoke comes back in. Smoke, and a hint of something must, linger for a while. Soy seems to come and go in the end. Half way throught the bottle and the aroma now seems to become quite apetizing and the flavors mellow out. Not an everyday beer but it definitely has its charm. Getting to the end of the glass there are now some more subtle flavors coming through. Slight burnt chocolate, maybe something grassy, and I want to say that there is a dark berry hiding back there someplace, perhaps too affraid of the smoke to show itself. My description may not seem too flattering but I think that this is a beer to try... and if you dont like it, add some honey and this would make a killer marinade for a nice pork loin!","Brasschaat, BELGIUM","CapedBrewsader"

Looks lovely, a dark amber or mahogany colour with a barrage of bubbles clinging to the glass but its all a ruse. Aroma of smoked cheese, hickory bacon and smokey roasted malts. Taste is dominated by the smoked character with a sort of stout like quality. Gassy with a long slightly watery smokey hop finish. Reminds me of the smell stuck in your nose after lingering over the bar b q pit too long, as I tend to...

3108,"2007-04-14",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 26, 2012 Score is for overall impression over many bottles and out of the oakwood keg at the Brauhaus in Bamberg, where it was likely the best smoked beer Ive ever had.  Notes below are old and need revision.


The nose is almost entirely smoked salmon and smoked cheddar, very forthright and direct with the creamy, almost milky smoke scent.  Smooth liquid and creamy texture, lightly biting with the smoked grains and salmon flavors, finishing with a touch of sweetness and a wallop of liquid smoke.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

3108,"2007-04-05",3.4,"Bottled.  Poured a clear reddish-brown with a well-maintained cap of beige head... thick, thorough lacing.  The aroma was remniscent of a smoldering campfire and well-smoked sausage... deeper down were caramel, mild alcohol, and fresh autumn leaves...  nice stuff.  The flavor was a tad sharper and less refined.. brown sugar, caramel, and intensely-smoked malts... salty with some very well-smoked lunchmeat.. sharp around the edges (I was struggling with the source, and I think BeerBelcher hit it with seawater).  Medium-bodied... left salty bacon on a long finish.  Solid drink.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
3108,"2007-04-04",3.0,"This was the smokiest rauchbier Ive ever had, and that isnt necessarily a good thing!  It is very substantial, and has a flavor remiscent of eating fresh bacon inside a smokehouse, but not enough beer character for me.  Not very drinkable, but very interesting.

It boured a sparkling red color with a medium amount of head.  It had a salty, smokey, meaty smell.  It was downright bacon-like in flavor, but I wish had more beer character.  I felt the beer-flavor in this beer was totally overwhelmed by this bacon flavor.  It had a salty mouthfeel, like a mouthful of seawater.  Not very drinkable.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

Tastes of smoked ham, a bit astringent and some toasted malts at the end. Solid, balanced and catchy smoked character. MF is medium, although the smoke factor affects drinkability from my point of view. Interesting and evidently well crafted, but not something I would drink everyday.","Santiago, CHILE","Fukito"

(original rate- 3.6) Bottled, Pipers End Beer Festival.  Startlingly smoky, Viking Jorvik Centre nose, according to some of my samplers. This is really wrinkling a few nostrils. An ancient, waxy, bootpolishy, but above all, beechwoody smokiness. A definite hint of museum. Considering the nose, pours with a surprisingly clear red transparency. Still, flattish mouthfeel. Smoky but creamy, like Austian smoked cheese. Cant help but think of smoked hams and Bratwurst. Massively evocative nose. The smokiness in the flavour is only marginally more assertive than in Black Cat or Cains Dark Mild. Got to try this with food next time. Completely unique, and wonderfully offensive to outsiders.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"

3108,"2007-03-08",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 11, 2010 Mahogany body with a medium beige head.  I just drank a bottle of the Marzen and a bottle of the Urbock side-by-side.  Smoke-time!!!  Although their Urbock is supposed to be the reference for the Smoked genre I thought the Marzen more than held its own.  Aroma was campfire smoke for the Marzen and smoked bacon for the Urbock.  Smoke intensity in mouth was comparable (very high for both).  The Marzen has a lighter body with flavours of roasted malts, candies, light caramel and a surprise lemony twist.  The finish was refreshing and even a little tart.  The Urbock on the other hand has flavours of creamy malts, thick caramel, molasses with a long and intense finish of molasses.  Its a draw.  Overall the Urbock is more intense but because of its heavy side I wouldnt drink two pints in a row.  While with the Marzen after one pint I was craving for more and more.  Full of smoke and addictive, makes you wonder what they put in it","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

3108,"2007-02-24",3.1,"500ml bottle purchased from LCBO in Toronto.  Pours a clear, medium brown with no head and a bit of carbonation.  Aroma reminiscent of a smoky fireplace.  Taste is of malts, quickly replaced by a smoky aftertaste, which is not as dominating as I was fearing.  The beer went down pretty nicely in the end, and I must admit I was a bit terrified about drinking this one based on some of the reviews I read.  On the other hand, my wife just told me that I smell like cigarettes.  Not my cup of tea (or pack of smokes), but interesting to try.  Would love to see what their smoky weizen is like.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","sstackho"

It has all the elements of a fine smoked beer, great aroma, fantastic flavor,  a deep ruby appearance. Unfortunately however most smoked beers (even the very good ones) can be very overpowering, creating a love-hate relationship with most drinkers. This however goes where no smoked beer (that I have tried) has gone before. It provides such exceptional drinkability and balance, its mind boggling to to think how this is possible with so much flavor  in the mix. This then isnt just a smoked beer for the fans of the style but a beer for everyone to enjoy and appreciate. A fantastic pairing with BBQ.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","StateofTrance"

Pours a deep chestnut brown, reddish hued, with a disappearing off-white head.  Strong ashy notes on the nose - Brendon calls it ""a glass of smoky bacon bits"" and Fritha calls it ""billy tea"" (campfire tea, not the dearly departed NZ comedian). Whatever you call it, and both of them are quite apt, I like it.  Also has a rich background of Munich malt. In the mouth it is creamy, with med-low carbonation and a med-full weight.  This allows a lovely, clean, toasty Munich richness to dominate. Lowly hopped, and the ash notes arent noted on the tongue.  Its pretty fresh but I can imagine it even fresher.  World Class.

The aroma of this stuff is like being out in the woods with an open fire, burning freshly chopped wood, smoked ham. It captures an open fire character with such accuracy. Amazing malt depth is evident in the smoky layers of meaty & chewy flavors. The Smokiness of this is a bit less pronounced than the Ur Bock, but its presence is perfect. Robust wood character smothers the malt the entire way through. Smoky beef jerky , hickory rub, and tons of beechwood smoke. Perfectly balanced and creamy.

Smokey, malty taste with full flavours of smoked ham or sausages, tar, hints of chocolate and discreet notes of spicy hops in a fairly dry finish. A lot better unfiltered, more of everything and still better balance.","Hässelby, SWEDEN","Svesse"
3108,"2007-01-21",2.0,"The smoke seemed almost artificial, as if someone poured a bottle of liquid smoke into a decently made octoberfest.  Ten sips into it, and my gut turned.  Im not afraid of smoke.  I grew up making country hams in my familys smoke house.  Ive cooked a slab of ribs over hickory for ten hours.  But with those, the smoke doesnt overwhelm as it does in this beer.  Perhaps Im not man enough for this beer, but then,  maybe some people are too manly for their own good.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","Zymologist"

3108,"2007-01-19",3.7,"500 ml botte. Best before date 2004-05. I’ve had this one lying around for while. Dark brown colour with a deep reddish hue. Medium sized mixed off-white head. Grainy and wort-like aroma at first then strong pungent bacon aroma. Well-rounded texture. Seemingly little carbonation. Feels quite bready, much like pumpernickel. Not really sweet, but not particularly dry either. Flavourwise there isn’t much smoke (or bacon if you will) to be detected, but rye instead. Burping makes the room smell of pumpernickel. This is something very special. An acquired taste for sure. I didn’t like it the first time, but this time it wasn’t that bad. I have a fresh bottle in the fridge as well, so I’ll try that one soon to compare. There’s nothing wrong with this vintage, rather the opposite as it is quite rounded and mellow.","Oslo, NORWAY","Gr0ve"
3108,"2007-01-18",1.8,"After hearing about smoked biers, I had to give it a try, and, well, maybe Im not a true beer aficionado, but I did not care for this taste in the least.  First, the scent of smoke upon opening the bottle was overwhelming, and not particularly pleasant either.  The pour is deep mahogany color, with little head.  The flavor and scent throughout the entire glass was that of a smoldering campfire.  To be perfectly honest, I would have rated this beer lower, due to my personal preferences, but do not want to do damage to the rating that currently stands, as I am one of many opinions, though I find it hard to believe that nobody else strongly dislikes this beer","Valparaiso, Indiana, USA","valpoaj"
3108,"2007-01-16",3.3,"Like nothing I have ever tasted before. Brown with a fading white head, although the second pour was vigorous and puffed up quite a bit. Aroma is quite assertive, with smoked pork, charred wood, liquid smoke, some smoked chile peppers - really the essence of a campfire, with a bit of brown sugar or sweet caramel malt in there for some balance and good measure.  The taste is not overpowering, with smoke predominant but balanced well by a subtle but clean hop bitterness and an overlying caramel malt presence.  Finishes with a slightly metallic touch. Becomes much more mild as it warms, developing a greater bitterness and an easy drinkability. On the tongue, nothing special but nothing to critique.  Not exactly my favorite - I just cant ever see turning to this one another time, but it was definitely worth a try to see just what this smoke beer thing is all about.","Ithaca, New York, USA","dmradus"
3108,"2007-01-16",3.8,"Dark brown/amber pour topped with a foamy, creamy off-white head.  Great lace.  Wonderful smoke and coffee aroma.  Smooth mouthfeel with a pleasing smoky aftertaste.  The perfect complement to my ""Bubba Burger""!","Boone, North Carolina, USA","BiochemProf"
3108,"2007-01-14",3.6,"Pours a deep dark brown, with frothy one finger head that recedes slowly to a spotty cap and thick ring, leaving behind a nice webbing of lace.

Smell; this smells strongly of smoked pork. I also get some caramel malts, with a little sweetness in there.

Taste; interesting smokey flavors that I associate with homemade smoked pork. Theres those sweet caramel, and toffee malts that mingles very nicely with the smoked flavors, with just some hints of hop bitterness in the finish.

Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, but the drinkability is higher than I was expecting. This is only the second true Rauchbier that Ive had, and I cant believe how good it is. I have a couple more different ones to sample, and now i cant wait to try them.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"
3108,"2007-01-13",3.5,"Pours a clear dark maple with a thick head and large slow moving bubbles.  Aroma and flavor is very smokey, almost too smokey for my palate.

3108,"2007-01-13",4.0,"Pours a clear brownish ruby color, with about half an inch of light tan head. The foam dies back in about a minute to a thick ring and a thin top layer. Surprisingly effervesent. No lacing. Strong smoky scent even before I start to pour the contents into my glass. 

First sip is medium heavy on that liquid smoke, but after a couple sips, I notice the malty character beneath the smoke. The maltiness is mildly sweet and a little bready. Hops are in there too, though only a fleeting taste right at the end. The smokiness lingers for several minutes in the aftertaste.

3108,"2007-01-07",2.8,"UPDATED: JUN 3, 2009 Dark brown pour with a minimal off-white head. Smokey malt aroma, smokey sour malt flavor. The finish? Smokey. I hate to call this a one-note beer, because it was obviously made with skill and talent, but the smoke overpowers everything to me. Thats okay, though. It is what it is and its tasty ... if you like smoke. Nice for the novelty, but definitely not my style. Tastes like a house fire smells.","Cullman, Alabama, USA","RichJ7"
3108,"2007-01-07",3.2,"Wooooow!!! HELP, HELP - where is the fire extinguisher???? - smoke comes out of my bottle!! Well OK, if I have to be honest, its only smoke aroma or should I rather call it smell... The color of the beer is mahogany red/brown, almost black and the head is OK. My previous experience with smoked beer was at this point only Highlander, and it seems like an infant compared to this one, that is a senior citizen... When my nose reaches the glass I feel like Im in a smokehouse, but I also sense notes of wharf and tar. The flavour is not salt, but otherwise it is smoked foods I taste. There is a lot of smoked meat, Danish salami and smoked eel skin in the above order. I cannot find any other notes, and I briefly get the idea that this might be the ideal way to loose weight for lovers of smoke - stop eating and start drinking, but then again LOL. No, honestly, it was a great experience to taste this beer, and I actually drank all of it myself. I also tried it with my dinner, but that wasnt a pleasure. This has to be a beer that you either love or hate, and right now (medio July 05) Im not sure where I belong, Ill have to taste it again some day to know for sure...","Thisted, DENMARK","Maria"

3108,"2007-01-01",3.8,"Dark mahogany with quickly dissappearing head. The same smoky malt aroma as the other Schlenkerla offerings, somewhat milder than the Urbock and a bit more twangy/spicy than the Weizen. Really enjoyable. Overall it was more balanced than the others, also in the taste which was lighter than the Urbock but heavier & more dry than the Weizen. Good mouthfeel, fits the rest of the brew very well. A nice alternative to the heavier & rougher Urbock, it just lacked a bit of intensity. Nonetheless a great rauchbier.","Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","iep"

Nice aroma that reminds me of a crisp fall day.  I didnt pick it up at first, but after Sir Brockmore shoved a bottle of Laphroaig under my nasal passage, I did certainly detect a similar peatiness to the scotch.  Nice.

Smokey, peaty malt in the aroma which reminded me quite specifically of Laphroaig scotch. Flavour is again quite smoky, but not overwhelmingly so, with a good amount of sweet malt in the background for balance. The aroma is actually stronger than the flavour, at least as far as the intensity of the smoke is concerned. Not really a beer for the uninitiated to the style, but interesting nonetheless, and the best of the style (of which Im not really a fan) that Ive had to date.

This is a superb rauchbier.  Color is dark brown (cola) and is surprisingly clear.  Aroma and flavor are both an amazing smoke with a hint of meatiness behind it.  The smokiness is rich and completely permiates this brew, but its a bit hard to describe.  It isnt like burned or charred wood, it isnt artificial in taste or smell, and it isnt overpowering.  It is meatly, rich, and satisfying.  The finish is dry, slight char, and some bittering hops come through.  Medium body, but full on the tongue.  Overall, this beer has a rich and complex malt base and deep smokiness to it.  It is a wonderful sipping beer and would probably be well acoompanied by fine cigar and would also go great with many types of food.  I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and look forward to trying it again, the other rauchbier offerings from this brewery (they also make a wheat and ur-bock version), and other smoked beers in gerneral.

Moderate carbonation, clean, but with the lingering aftertaste of smoke and bitter hops. Dry in the end.

Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, very long finish with medium bitterness.

Just a pinch of bitterng on the finish. This one improves upon warming. I bought two bottles. I anticipated drinking only one of them. I drank one cold then the other made the hour trek home in a paper sack. It was so delicious I couldnt resist. The temperature of bottle two was perfect. This brew rocks. Its so easy to drink with perfect balance of flavor.Its funny how an aroma will evoke such childhood memories. I highly recommend this brew. DONT BE SCARED OFF BY THE STRONG AROMA.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"
3108,"2006-09-10",3.0,"500ml Bottle: My 101st review, only hours after #100.  This was supposed to be my century mark but it scared me to so I waited until dinner.  Pours ruby red with an off-white head that quickly faded to significant lacing.  Aroma of liquid smoke, if youre familiar with that, much like hickory although were told its beechwood.  As it warms you get touches of sweet malt.  Initial ice cold flavour is just dominated by smoke, this is one you must allow to warm.  Once it was only cool the malts and hops were brought out, but the smoke is still prominent.  Excellent workmanship, and I can respect the effort, but Ill never drink one again.  Take that for what you will.","Bolton, Ontario, CANADA","Slacks"

3108,"2006-09-01",2.7,"Brown hue.  Smells like smoked salami or gouda to me (smoked of course).

Aroma dominated by sweet smoked meat, maybe some caramel if you really dig. Mouthfeel smooth, lightly prickly, a bit dry. Sloppy, spotty lacing. Flavor is highly smoke-driven, hard to pick out much underneath. Sweet smoked meat with a malt backbone buried in there is about best I can describe. Finishes somewhat bitter, and aftertaste is more bitter than smokey. Texture and taste-wise, I enjoyed the Urbock and Lagerbier more than this.","Boothbay, Maine, USA","porterhouse"

Poured a rudy hued dark brown with a foamy off-white/beige head that settled into a thin lacing, small amount of sticking.

The right amount of moderate carbonation and a crisp, chewy and smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.

Delicious smokey tasty, a nice meatiness, a caramelized sugary maltiness, a vanilla oak woodiness, the hops provide a soft bitterness in the middle, and a smokey malt with touches of caramel finish, smooth, good drinkability.

This is what Beechwood aging is really supposed to mean - just kidding this is smoked with beech not fermented in it.

Sweet maltiness upfront ending with dark toastiness from Munich malts yieldiing a satisfying dryness to wrap it up.

Pours precisely the same colour and carbonation as a glass of coke, with a faint offwhite head. The aroma is of smoke pure and simple, with some malts present. Tastes obviously smokey, like a strange mixture of malt beer and a smoked meat. Gotta admit its a bit too smokey for my tastes. The aftertaste is as if you were chewing on charcoal from a fire.

The flavor is an amazing deadringer for bacon.  As a vegetarian willing to make exceptions for things like bacon and pastrami, I think I might be able to cross bacon off of the list entirely thanks to the flavors in this beer.

It begins with a light malty hint which moves into a very heavily smoked malts and bacon.  The smoked bacon flavor lingers for quiet some time.  A tiny hop bitterness hits near the end, but is very quickly covered in the smoked bacon.  Fairly smooth, not too carbonated.  Not my favorite style, but I had to try one from Aecht.

Ive had this one sitting in my cellar for six months or so; I was inspired by Oakes latest column ( http://www.ratebeer.com/Beer-News/Article-621.htm ) to pull it out and give it a taste.

Pours an elegant clear caramel brown without much head. Smoked malt of course dominates the aroma, with a bit of dry-cleaners shop in there as well.  The flavor is not as powerfully smoky as the aroma, at least on the front side of each sip. This gives the caramel malts a chance come through, rich and slightly sweet, before the smoke intermingles with mild bitter hops to provide the finish.

Im relative newcomer to smoked beers; in some ways the smoked malts remind me of a strongly dry-hopped IPA in the mouth-drying finish. I cant say that Im to the point where I prefer the smoke to the hops, but this is interesting and enjoyable as well.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

3108,"2006-05-08",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2006 Wow, interesting beer. I dont think I can drink more than 4 or 5 oz a day. The smoke flavor just becomes too much. Poured out clear amber in color with a small khaki head. Aroma is pure smoke. Smells like a small fire is smoldering in my glass. There is just a hint of malt hidden behind the smoke aroma and really no hop presence. Taste is smoky and sweet malts. The smoke flavor seems similar to that of an Oak Cask aged Irish whiskey like Jameson Gold. But instead of the bright fresh wood taste and smell this is more charred wood embers in the flavor. I do taste some hops on the tongue and some bitterness does remain in the aftertaste. But the key player here is the smoke infused malts present throughout the taste profile. No mistake about it, its a smoke beer. For me this beer should shine when accompanied with the correct food. It goes OK with sharp cheddar cheese.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

by opening the bottle,the beer has a really intensive smoke smell ,as if one would sit on the fire-place(like smoke from wood).in the glass too,that smoke smell is there,but when smelling longer,something malty is hidden behind(very hidden)
by drinking the smoke impression is still there,but now,it remembers more smoked pork than wood.but not only smoky, it s a bit hoppy in the mouth, and even a little bit of malt comes trough.Fizzy little bubbles.
tasts more refreshing than one expects by smelling.
Aftertaste smoky,and an interesting bitterness.
I would not drink it for accompagnating smoked meat,that would be a bit too much smoked things the same time.(such a meal wouldlack of contrasts!perhaps one could try it with something other)
for me,thats a beer one can drink with some friends at an evening or so,with friends,to discuss about it.

I was expecting to find a layer of fat in this beer. Other than the shock factor of this beer, it tasted a lot better than it smelled and was very smooth in the mouth.

Dark ruby brown pour, full beige head.  Intense, intense woody smokiness, big aroma.  A little burning in my nose and eyes at first, maybe its just the sensory memories of sitting too close to the fire on a chilly night.  Could spend a half hour just smelling this.  Smoked bacon or ham, also in the taste.  Full, thick body.  Balanced.  Dry finish and a lasting, slightly more subtle smoke aftertaste.

3108,"2006-04-12",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 24, 2010 Bottle. Pours to a rich dark brown, with a small white head. Mild carbonation. Aroma is very smokey, but is heightened with smokey meat scents like bacon and ham, as well as ash. Compared to the Urbock, the Marzen is cleaner to the palate, not as thick, and not as smokey, but still retains wonderful character and body. Smokey and roasted malt flavor is detectable, but the dominent smoke and bacon, and wood-smoke flavors make for a well rounded and enjoyable Rauchbier. I feel the Urbock has a slight edge, but this is a wonderful example for the style. I do not drink Rauchbier often, but Schlenkerla makes a great product and I am pleased that it is widely available.","New Windsor, New York, USA","beerscout"
3108,"2006-04-10",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2006 Draft.  WOW! Aroma is in every way similar to a smokehouse full of ham! Pretty light orange semi-cloudy color with a decent off-white head.  Drinks easily even with probably a higher carbonation than Id like but I will forgive them! Taste is an essence of smoked whitefish (in my opinion) but definite hops presence is noticeable. The woody BBQ-like flavor never diminshes yet does not overpower. Every bit the conversation piece as well as an enjoyable drink. Im in love.
Re-Rate for BOTTLED sample. Hmmm. Not nearly as delightful as on draft. Less aroma. Obvious metallic taste that I did not get from the draft. Odd.","Southside, Richmond, Virginia, USA","Norton"

Medium carbonation was nice,  The sweetness of the malt is very well balanced with the smokey taste.  The aftertaste is also very pleasant, perhaps a little spicey, reminiscent of a fine smoked gouda cheese.  At any rate, this is a style Ill need to look at more closely in the future.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Fish"

The flavor is also nice and smoky with malt, bacon, & very little bitterness detectable.  It is very smooth and medium-bodied.  It goes down easy!  Especially after a 9.5 hour flight and a 2.5 hour train ride through the snow!

smoked pork chops.  A little much at first but calmed down somewhat after the brew had
a chance to breath.  Pours a dark garnet.  The average creamy off white head has fair
lacing and retention.  The flavor is primarily sweet.  The caramel malt is underlying an
intense grilled smoke tone.  Complex to be sure.  The medium body is creamy and soft.

If anything, I wound up finding this an interesting, surprisingly drinkable take on the concept of beer, if not exactly delicious. This experimental beer strikes me as something typically German, and my timing couldnt have been better as I drank it along to a meal of sauerkraut, dumplings, and pork hock! Needless to say, it fit in beautifully given the context and I actually enjoyed it. Still, its more of a novelty beer that I wouldnt drink with any real regularity.

A phenomenal rauchbier, and a classic example of the style. As with the Spezial, the aromas and flavors are just so much fresher and brighter than the bottled and exported draught versions we get in the US. You cant go wrong with any version of this beer, but to enjoy half liter after half liter of this beer in the Altstadt, and in Bamberg, is really something special for a beer lover. As much as I love this one, it is not for everyone. Some beer drinkers just cant get past the smoke in this beer, and find the aromas and flavors just too much. But for those who love this style, Schlenkerla is as world class, as a beer can get. This one works extremely well with hearty German fare, and is a wonderful beer to just drink and enjoy.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

3108,"2006-01-18",3.6,"(500 ml bottle: $3.50 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) With the powerful aroma of smoked meats, especially ham, you know exactly what this beer is going to be about just on one quick sniff.  I cant pick up anything else in the nose, but then again, I dont have the most sensitive sense of smell.  While the flavor is most certainly very smoky, the lightly sweet and caramely malt is there initially, but tends to get lost very quickly because the smoke really picks up and finishes very strongly.  So the only chance to really taste the malt is immediately after sipping the beer, and only when the beer warms up.  Otherwise, its lightly roasty, somewhat bitter, and the smokiness makes for a slight harshness in the finish (but in a good way).  Body is medium, but just seems thin for how much flavor this beer is packing.  Carbonation is about average for beer, but keeps the smokiness from weighing down the palate.  Deep amber in color with excellent clarity.  Over an inch of light tan head forms on the pour, gradually settling to a thin but complete layer, leaving patchy lacing behind in the process.  All in all, very enjoyable, especially the lingering smokiness on the palate.  Although I think I enjoyed the flavor of the Märzen a bit more than the Weizen, the Weizen had more complexity.  The smoke and caramely malts of the Märzen seem to go hand in hand, but the wheat offered more of a counterpoint to the smoke.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Unlike any brew Ive ever smelled before.  Flavor is not quite as smokey, though it is still very smokey.  There is some faint roastiness in there, but then the smokey cheese and sausage takes over.

3108,"2006-01-09",4.0,"I half-suspect that if you shat in a glass, these blokes could add smokemalt, ferment it and come back with something tasty. Damn, theyre good. This one doesnt quite match the Urbock IMO, but its still a superb beer. Teak colour with a fat layer of foam that painted the glass beige on the way down. Theres a depth and intensity to their smokemalt that no other rauchbier (that Ive sampled) matches. This has a rich aroma of hickory, oak cask, smoky bacon crisps and a meaty Christmas ham note. Doesnt quite live up to the promise of the aroma. There was a hint of acetone and lemonade in the first sip before the smokemalt took over. Then it developed typical rauch burnt wood flavours, long and dry in the finish. For a rauch, this is ridiculously sessionable. Medium bodied and very rounded.

Only two apparent smells are dark roasted malt and smoked pork. You may think you dont want your beer smelling like meat but this ones kosher, believe me.

Thin and watery on the tongue, moderate carbonation - the smoke flavor picks up immediately before youve even had a chance to swallow. Tastes almost entirely of smoky, roasted malt - almost no hop presence whatsoever (nor any trace of meat flavoring, thank Whomever). Altogether extremely smoky, but not in a ""burnt"" sort of way.

3108,"2005-11-13",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2008 Bottled. Brown and low on carbonation with tan head. Aroma is dominated by smoked elements. Smoked pork and campfire. Light maltaroma. Flavor has baconaroma-like elements and caramel. A special beer! Rating: 6-3-6-3-12-3(051028)Bottle. Pours a beautiful clear, copper body with a small, dense beige head leaving some lacings. The nose has a nice fruityness that I havent noticed earlier when rating it, and of course theres a roasted, bonfire-burnt, ashy aroma with the touch of bacon always detected. Theres caramel too. Its a bit thin in the mouth, but that of course makes it suited for a long night of drinking. Flavorwise it finishes with a flavor reminding of when removing ash from the oven and theres a flavor reminding of broadleaved wood as well. The beer reveals a fruityness hard to sense the first times drinking it, as its far from as pushing as the smoked flavors. The caramel sweetness is also in the background. It finishes with a lasting sweetness, and of course lots of burnt down bonfire and something bacon-like. The fruityness is also present. Sure lovely.This is a beer surely needing some time to get familiar with, but when familiar, it sure is quaffable and quenching. I remember the first time I had it, at the Schlenkerla tavern. Even though the ambience is wonderful, the beer didnt suit my palate, I think I needed almost an hour finishing my glass. Time for sure changes the palate.

Some raters noted beef jerky flavors and I have to agree, particularly in the finish.  What a unique style of beer!

Smells of smoking wood, bacon, my sweatshirt after sitting by a campfire, with some buried bales of hay.

The mouthfeel is slightly slick with a low amount of carbonation.

Taste?  Smoky.  The whole thing is like a mouthful of wood smoke.  This smoky taste lingers on into the aftertaste, becoming the aftertaste.  This aftertaste lingers on in your mouth, causing your wife to make comments about eating bacon this late at night.  Part way through, the smokiness seems to get filtered out somewhat by my brain, allowing me to discern a touch of honey sweetness.

Its ok.  Looks good, smells pretty much as expected etc etc.  In general, an interesting rauchbier, but not distinguished enough for me.  Just better than average in most regards, but still just a run of the mill brew as far as Im concerned.","Corner Brook, Newfoundland, CANADA","JustinBathurst"

3108,"2005-08-09",4.8,"This one was an absolute pleasure to drink. So much so I was side-tracked on my first tasting a few weeks ago and ended up reading through the Schlenkerla website rather than focusing on the rating. I have since stock-piled my cellar with bottles of this in the fear it may not be available in Oz for too much longer. Poured into a chalice glass, a thin bubbly, dense pad of beige foam settled atop a clear, deep russet-brown body. Head lasted for the length and left a little legs. Unique and initially overwhelming aroma of cured pork and beef, pickled anchovies, smoky, roasted malt and ash, peppery spices and an unusual hint of dark dried and aged fruits. The aroma set the mood nicely and continued to waft from the glass as I sipped. Lighter than expected body, extremely flavoursome and well rounded, unbelievably smooth and as complex as the aroma. Quite smoky and woody, the light spritzy carbonation bounces the cured meats, roasted grain, bready yeast, zesty dried fruits and husky ash flavours across the palate and manages to invade every orifice of the mouth, before finishing off with a long, dry and mouth watering, burnt grain swallow. The beer seemed to alter its character as I went along, but remained and absolute treat for the senses. Refreshing, explosive, mellowing and unique, all at the same time. This became an instant favourite on my first sip and gets better with every bottle since. A love it or hate it beer, but for me its a winner. Lovely!!! (500mL, Intl beer shop, W.

3108,"2005-08-06",3.4,"Thanks to MJames and his Baconut forum for finally get me off my ass and rating this beer. I was rating while enjoying a maple cured bacon, sharp cheddar, egg, and homemade pumpernickel bread sammich. YIPPIE 4 Beer!  Displays a nice mahogany hue with fading fizzy head and some lace.  The aroma comes right out and lets you know what to expect with a heavy smoked bacon and burnt wood overtone and some esters of salt, minerals, and caramel. The taste follows suit mostly with a big woody  and meaty overtone with just a dose of light bitters to keep ya interested. One-dimensional, sure, but it does it spot on. The feel is actually thin and fore giving which allows you to finish the whole bottle. (I think the sammich is helping here as well). Good and the paring worked well with my 1st dinner. Still I like the Weizen and Urbock better (and the Fastenbier, well that was other-worldly)","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
3108,"2005-08-04",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2005 Bottle (500ml).  I have had this a few times, now I will attempt to rate it.  You have to be in the mood for this one.  Right from the cap-pop, theres a lovely smoky bacon aroma in the air.  Poured deep ruby-brown, with a very large, foamy, bubbly light tan head.  Aroma is smoke, raw meat (sorry!), iron-tangy like thick blood, fresh-hewn harwood, some heavy yeast and various strong earthy notes - dirt, mulch, mushrooms.  Taste is mosty smoke - campfire, smoke-house, wet ashes - and a little sweet malt getting through.  Most of the normal tasting vernacular just doesnt apply to this one.  Mouthfeel is oily and a little thin-bodied for the colour and aroma.  As it warms, I have to hold my breath to drink it - the butcher-shop aroma gets almost overpowering.  Hard to finish and I dare you to have TWO.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
3108,"2005-08-01",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2007 I was pretty excited to find this at Acland Cellars only about a month after I was drinking the stuff at the pub in Bamberg. Ahh... the memories... I actually didnt really like the bottled version when I had it in Sweden but this one didnt disappoint. I love the colour of this stuff - dark ruby-brown, beautiful. Head retentions only OK. Aroma is beautifully woody and smoky, with a nice maltiness and some vanilla in behind it. This is the one smoked beer that doesnt smell or taste like meat to me. First time I had this I was surprised at how light-bodied it was, but in a lot of ways this is a real feature of the beer. Taste starts quite woody, malt is there but its not thick at all like some others. Nicely dry with a fair bitterness at the end which really works. I really like how its not sweet at all (which was my main problem with the Spezial beers). Its a stupid cliche but this is one beer that really does get better the more you drink of it.RR: I think Ive spent enough time there now to say that this is the best beer in Bamberg, which is really annoying because I can buy it at home in pretty good nick, but obviously its not the same as drinking it at the brewery tap. Ive tried a bunch of rauchbiers now and still havent found anything as good as this. Absolutely classic.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

3108,"2005-06-24",3.3,"UPDATED: JUN 25, 2005 Bottled.  Pours a brownish amber, with a light beige head that quickly dissipates.  Aroma is of major smoke and kielbasa sausage and canadian bacon and maybe some malt squeezing its way through.  Upfront, the flavor is fairly intensely smokey but it mellows into a pleasantly malty sweet flavor and finishes dry.  Im getting a slight bit of hop bitternes though no hop flavor can compete with the smoke.  Body is on the thin side but the carbonation is perfect.  Decent beer for the style though I highly doubt I could drink more than one per.....year.  Wish I had some eggs to go with this beer.

3108,"2005-06-20",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2014 Fiery bronze. Fully sustained rocky wisp of head. Resplendent nose of anise-spiced smoked poultry, tobacco, and perfectly ripe black plums. Wafts of straw and clean lager yeast sneak into the nose. Creamy, but with an equal amount of chalkiness to match. Understated medicinal sharpness quells the deceptive fruitiness. Dab of caramelized malt and maple glaze sweetness lies sandwiched between the chalky-edged dryness and smoky bacon. Intensity of the smoke, coupled with the spiciness of the hops, leave the palate numb. So polished and elegant, but magically rustic, as well. Lush malt notes deposit tongue hugging starches and lightly husky malts (Pils?) which act as an eternal undergird to the body. Dangerously quaffable due to the impeccable attenuation, but, amazing, it retains its satisfyingly smoky and bready girth. Firm, depth-lending punch of minerals compounds the dry, herbal twinge of hops, along with the gentler fruitiness that lurks beneath. Finishes commandingly bready and perpetually smoky with a crowning stroke of straw. Hail to the wonders of double-decoction mashing. After all these years, this still hails as THE quintessential Rauchbier.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Flavor is smoky of course yet malty compares to a porter yet lacks the sweetness of one but very full of roasted flavor.  As you get deeper into the beer the strong smoke flavor seems to fade and the malts grow stronger.  On the palate it is a little dry but very smooth.

3108,"2005-05-12",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 22, 2005 These original smoked beers are quite different from the smoked porters which are popular in America right now.  This marzen has a thin head and the distinctive aroma of campfire and some metallic elements in the aroma and flavor.  It has a lighter mouth feel and would pair perfectly with some grilled German sausages.  This is a good beer--much lighter drinking than the smoked porters, but also less sweet and with a more pronounced campfire smokiness.  The first time is a bit of a challenge, but after that the cravings kick in.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"
3108,"2005-05-10",4.1,"Pours a dark ruby but thats not really the color. Looks like the water at Blackwater Falls in WV. If youve been, you know. If not I apologize for my lack of color vocabulary. Sort of a ruby-brown I guess. A good sized tan head but it quickly dissipates. Some light lacing. Smells like pork rinds. Thats all I can smell. Its smoky and porky and smells just like pork rinds to my nose.

Taste is overwhelmingly smoky to my palate. I mean, I have had rauchbier before but only American versions. This is the smokiest damn beer ever. Smoked pork, smoked shrimp are the flavors that come to mind. As I slowly get my tongue around the smoke, it is a nice malty marzen in there somewhere. Not sticky but a smooth maltiness. A very defined cigar aftertaste but I like cigars so thats cool with me. Not too drinkable for me, a sipper for sure but an experience in itself. As a beer advocate, you usually have some sort of reference for a style but this beer is unique to me.

Im preferring this to a lot of the dime-a-dozen dunkels because when this finishes (where dime-a-dozen dunkels leave little resonating), this one leaves smoked malt tracts.  Very palpable.

My dad is on his way to Germany and is going to bring me back some great beers, so  I thought I might pull this out of my cellar and give it a try  to celebrate the nearing arrival of my German beer. Served at 57° in my NB worthy glass. Pours reddish brown with a light off white head. No sediment apparent. Amazingly enough, the aroma is smokey, like smoked ham. It seems to be both sweet and smokey. The aroma is sweet at first, then the smoked ham flavor kicks in. This is my 2nd smoked beer, the first was a smoked  porter, which seemed a easier vessel in which to take the smoke flavor, this is just a lighter beer and the smoke takes center stage. Besides the smoke, which, by the way, is not over the top, there is a nice malty flavor with some notes of brown sugar. The finish is smokey. Mouthfeel is about medium, not light, but not very heavy either. I feel that I should re-rate this after I get more experience with smoked beers, which might prove to be somewhat difficult...

Thin bodied, taste begins very smokey but is simultaneously encountered by a sweet, watery, malt background that includes some light chocolate. Aftertaste is sweet malt and smoked cedar. This beer is not that great. Im guessing it has such a high rating because this is the first smoked beer people have had, as this beer is readily available in most places. Luckily I had the opportunity to try the Altenmünster Rauchenfelser Steinbier last weekend and I was treated to a much better smoked flavor without the annoying sweetness that this beer has.

3108,"2004-11-09",3.9,"The first thing I noticed was the aroma. Never seen (smelled) a beer with such a potent aroma, and certainly never felt the smell of smoked pork bacon in a beer ! The head was light brown, pretty high and slow to disppear. The body was a beautiful deep, dark ruby red, and very promising. The flavour confirmed the aroma impression : very smoky, very filling too. Why I almost felt like I was drinking a whole meal! There was also a caramel second taste well concealed under the smoky first taste. My conclusion is, this is a very good beer for long Winter evening, in front of a fireplace, preferably sitting at my Stammtisch (habitual table) in a Bamberg restaurant !

It is simply delectable, and perhaps the most unique taste I have ever tasted.  Palate is medium, and the finish is smooth, smoky, and crisp.

Flavor starts off with dark caramel, a pinch of roastiness then, a ton of smokehaus wood/meat, bread and a hint of pipe tobacco. Pleasant light level of sweetness; very well-balanced. Ends with an earthy/herbal noble hop character and a tinge of pepper. Medium bodied with a smooth texture and perfect lively yet, non-prickly carbonation. Leaves great lacework.

3108,"2004-10-02",3.0,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2005 Bottle. The beer is clear with a deep copper-red colour, and the large (but quickly dissolving) foam is white with small bubbles.

The smell resembles the smell of fine smoked ham. There are also notes that make me think of fresh spruce wood, a pine-forest after a shower, and an old house with tar on the wooden roof. Yes, even the smell of nights at the campfire.

The carbon dioxide is just right  soft, pleasing and yet of firm character.

The taste is fresh; it got all the qualities of a fine dark lager beer with a soft taste of smoke curing, and it could be described as eating a sandwich made of dark rye bread and a really smoked ham. Yes, there is even a little touch of salt. Except for the smoke, there are notes of sour malts, mild hops and wood tar. The aftertaste is a mixture of dry hops, some fruity notes, a little burned taste and some mild smoke. The aftertaste vanishes surprisingly fast, leaving just a tar-ish taste, just like a young Islay whisky. 

A very nice and special beer, that I think is best enjoyed by itself. The very special smell and taste will probably dominate any sort of food or even snacks.","Linköping, SWEDEN","bark"

I was duly warned that this was funky, but just like other horrors in life, pre-notification is nothing like the first shock of experience.  Now I know that I am disgusted by smoked beers, which was an important lesson I guess, and how Im consoling myself with this.  I had about four sips (three too many, but I wanted to give it a chance), and then it went down the sink.  The smell, objectively, wasnt bad.  I like hickory smoke, it reminds me of BBQ and campfires.  Since this is attached to the sense of taste, though, the smell was weird and gross.  In the glass, it was orange-red and deep ruby, clear with no visible carbonation, some small lacing from the initially sizable frothy head.

As I sit tonight enjoying yet another, I realize that Ive yet to make any notes about the stuff - a testament to how wrapped up I get in Schlenkerla every time I drink one.  I find this beer to be nearly perfect in every way.  The appearance is a truly dignified burnt copper looking gold, like some ancient but charred fossil-amber.  The head is small, but it lasts throughout the glass.  The aromas are magnificent.  This beer reminds of my summers in Montana, campfires, forest fires in neighboring valleys, and enjoying smoked and cured meats from last seasons hunt.  The flavors are big and roasted and full of more smoke.  At the beer rounds out on the palate, a brine emerges and drops of with a resounding bitterness.  Yet smoke reigns throughout and there is never a question the intent of this beer.  On of my very favorite beers.  Amazing.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
3108,"2004-06-29",3.8,"The pour starts with a tan head and the nose is like campfire or bbq in the glass. The taste is the same way smoky all the way, with a definite taste of bacon.

This smells very much like a side of bacon that has been cured, smoked and aged.  Flavor is dead on with the aroma.  Smoke flavor, but also lots of meatiness, canadian bacon maybe.  Enjoyable beer, but I wouldnt drink more than one at a time.","Bedford, Texas, USA","TChrome"

3108,"2004-06-11",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2006 Poured a rich reddish-copper (almost like crystal cola) in the glass. A 2 finger tan fine pored head sprang up but reduced  to  a surface clinging 2cm cap that laced on the glass. Not overly carbonated. overriding aroma is of smoke...some some grainy-bready malt under the good food processing type smoke.. like birch or hardwood, reminiscent of smoke house meats. The first gulp the smoke overpowers your senses..all go blotto on the smoke signals...but after you have a sip or two or you finish a couple of pieces of cheese or oysters, the smoke power wanes and you get the mellow character of this delicate marzen...and it is delicate... with lots of subtle complexity (well made) you just dont get there on the first couple of gulps because its cloaked by the smoke. All in all this is a toughie of a beer to slot...great beer but too damn strong on smoke to be useful for anything else than a drink with similar strong tasting foods to off set them....like Jalapeno-infused anything or a strong tasting fish meal or mutton....I really liked this beer but I would never drink it on its own in a session with out food ....I had smoke taste up my nostrils and on the palate the next day...thought I slept through a fire in the complex....go easy on this brew...to be taken with food of a similar strength only!!","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"

Flavour is also smoky but less so, with malt, woodiness, and faint fruit before heading into a crisp finish.  As the beer warms, the smoke fades leaving even more fruit and wood flavour in the glass with some nuttiness becoming apparent as well.  Some spicy hops seem to come out as well.

Doesnt look like much - opaque and brown, but what a strong flavour!  The scent of smoke as it is sipped and a bizarre tingly explosion of flavour.  Aftertaste is dry and smoky. The first time I tried this beer, I struggled manfully and then wrote an appreciation.  This time, I was more realistic, and all through the drinking (which took a lot longer than it should have) I was thinking ""Id love to have a nice ale right now"".

Lots of lacing.  Smells of sweet malt, slight smoked woodiness.  No sediment of any sort and mostly clear, or I would have given it a 5 for appearance.  Taste starts out with a semi-sweet, ultra balanced marzen flavor; light honey, good nutty hops, caramel malt.  The smokiness comes on in the middle and slowly builds into a wonderful finish of smoke, smoke and more smoke.  Like smoking a nice cuban while eating a bacon, and smoked gouda sandwich on brown bread (ok no one actually does that, but you get the point).  Smoke is not subtle, but I did enjoy the fact that the flavors were layered and the marzen flavor was there at the start.  Medium body, didnt get any thinning.

Satisfying and continually refreshing; a quaffable contemplative pint.

50 cl bottle, best before November 2008.

Rerated on 11 January 08.  Much different than my experience many beers ago.  Sure, theres still plenty of smoke -- rich and sultry -- but refined, bready malts can easily be detected behind the glowing, ashy remnants of a previous evenings campfire.  Light mineral presence in the aroma along with barely noticeable earthy hops.  Rich, light brown hue with a medium, frothy, khaki head.  The flavor is smoky and dry throughout with a malty, almost toffee-like, sweetness in the background.  Feels a bit acidic, or perhaps its just the smoke playing tricks on my tongue.  Iodine and Bakelite notes emerge with some warmth.  I still get a little bit of fruitiness from this one, but it seems more like pears this time around.  A bit of smoothness is gained from a little more warmth.  Medium bodied with an oily texture and moderate carbonation.  A little experience has gone a long way in my enjoyment of this beer.  Previous score of 7,4,7,3,14=3.5.

50 cL bottle, goblet.  No real Märzen qualities show themselves in the aroma.  Theres lots of smoke, but nothing nasty like liquid smoke.  Even though its absurdly over the top, its quality.  A thick, creamy, white head is short and sits on a deep maroon body.  Moderately sweet, lightly acidic flavor becomes a moderately sweet, lightly bitter, lightly astringent finish.  Theres actually some nice caramel-apple Märzen flavors under the smokiness.  Hard to tell too much about it though.  Medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation.  The bottom line is: its good, but do I have to like it?","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"
3108,"2004-01-13",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2004 RE-RATE: My opinions on the aroma and flavor of this beer have changed quite a lot since I gave it an overall of 6 out of 20 some time ago.  Pours a clear maple syrup brown, with a large but diminishing foamy off white head.  Leaves a good lacing. 

Smells strongly of smoked meats, salt, hints of ripe apples underneath, and a touch of light floral sweetness.  Yummy.    

The flavor to me is reminiscent of a stout, but definately not the same thing.
There is some light honey sweetness, good maltiness, and of course, the smoke, with a nice bitterness in the long finish.

The mouthfeel is of medium thickness, with fine tingling carbonation.

3108,"2004-01-09",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2004 This may seem odd but my main comment is a warning to vegetarians, or simply those who don't like the smell of meat: don't try this beer. I tried to rate this beer objectively according to the quality I felt it offers but it is difficult for me to get past the meaty aroma and taste. Aside from my own reaction though I have to say this seems like an incrediblely well-crafted smoked beer. Campfire and smokehouse waft out of the bottleas soon as the cap is off of it and it doesn't relent. You'll feel like you are curing pepperoni or salami as you look into this deep brown beer. An acquired taste I would say....","Oshawa, Ontario, CANADA","beerhugger"

3108,"2003-12-28",4.0,"Dark auburn color with curling tendrils of head. High carbonation is evident through sporadic firing of bubble salvos up through the liquid. Aroma is a complex smokiness underpinned by cocoa, ovaltine, hickory, and walnuts. Flavor is sweeter than one might expect (although not really given the marzen base), and starts sweet while finishing quite dry. Charred meat, campfire, and burning sugar types of smokiness are all present. Some hop presence, but this is scared off by the bitter, smoky astringency. Interdigitated malt structure (caramel, pecans and molasses) comes through the wall of flavors. Overcarbonation keeps this beer from being all it could be (problem remedied ad hoc by decanting beer and leaving in fridge for 30 minute or so).","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","grant"
3108,"2003-12-26",3.2,"The head when poured had a darker toffee colour. Not the best head, disappeared quickly. Heavy hickory scent and taste. Small amount of toffee and roasted coffee.

3108,"2003-12-16",3.8,"Bottle, imported.

My first rauchbier, so take it for what it's worth.

Dark brown color, almost opaque.

Initial nose is instantly a musty, pungent smoke aroma, like a damp campfire from the night before, followed by a solid maltness like that of a doppelbock.

The cream colored head is cmposed of fine bubbles, but it fades quickly leaving a residual ring at the side of the glass and bits of brussels lace on the sides of the glass.  I had to pour aggressively to get any head at all.

The taste is first and foremost heavy smoke--not bitter and acidic like liquid smoke, but like a smoked brisket--deep, subtle and flavorful.  There's a bit of maltiness to it as well, but not as much as there is in the nose.  The smoke dominates everything, leaving an enduring smoky aftertaste.

A good, solid beer.  I can see why some people like rauchbier so much.

Wonderful taste..i like the dry smokiness it leaves on the back of my mouth..i can taste some nicely roasted malts beneath..but no hops to speak of, maybe the smokiness covers them..but this is good stuff.

Dark malts, burning wood, smoldering earth, and a smoked sausage hint. The burnt wood seems to stand out more that I recall. Taste is smoky malts, burnt wood, lighter notes of smoked meat, light spices and hints of smoked cheese. The body is medium with moderate carbonation and a lingering smokiness.

3108,"2003-10-10",5.0,"UPDATED: APR 7, 2010 The beer pours reddish copper in a Don de Dieu glass. Nice foamy head, it diminishes pretty fast though, but holds the glass fairly well. Surprising aroma, definitely a new class for me, meaty with bacon and ham, salty sausages. The flavors developments are quite unrivaled. Let me explain.. first that intense smokiness (long dry smoky/bitter finish)is kind of a guardian over the journey that tasting this beer is. Its also one of the not so typical beers that holds the 4 basic flavors. Mouth entrance is very malty and moderatly sweet with the body being medium to full. Then, those smoked malts develop into a salty (bacon is salty after all) taste. Slightly tart at the same time. The finish is intense and bitter, woody, earthy, peaty. I wouldnt drink this everyday, but I can see this doing wonders paired with multiple meals (pancakes, poultry, pepper beef etc.) I changed my mind and would definitely drink this everyday. An everyday intensely smoked and highly drinkable beer that goes well with most meals just as much as by itself. Blimey, if it aint a 5","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

3108,"2003-10-04",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 6, 2003 A tad smokier than their Urbock, and much smokier than the Weizen. Color is a very dark red, nearly black. The aroma is bacon. Seriously, it just smells like bacon, and little else. Hints of ham or other meats maybe, but not much of the usual malt/hop aromas of non-smoked beers. The flavor is also very meaty. I enjoyed the flavor, but the problem is that there isn't much of a hop presence, or even maltiness, to balance the smoke... so it really just tastes like smoke in a bottle. If you're in the mood for a beer like this it's great, but if you're not it's a bit too intense. I prefer the Urbock.","Newington, Connecticut, USA","fishonmyplane"

Aromatically, it certainly lives up to its Rauchbier name. Nose is intensely smokey and that's it. Reminds me of barbecue pork. Just a bit more going on in terms of flavor. Some acidic tartness, sweet malts, and of course loads of campfire smoke. Creamy mouthfeel reminiscent of a stout or full bodied porter. Just a touch of bittering hops in the finish.

3108,"2003-03-21",2.2,"(500 ml bottle). Well, any idiot can recognize that this beer has MORE aroma than (nearly) any other beer, and MORE flavour than a lot of beers. But to make a 100% honest rating, I have to ask myself: Do I actually LIKE the overpowering smell of smoked meat? Sadly, the answer is NO. I'm a beer drinker, not a goddamn sausage maker! The flavour is not quite as overpowering smoky as the aroma - at least you get a notion that you're drinking a beer and not just liquid smoked meat. Still, it tastes like something that has just been saved out of the burnt-out ruins of a brewery. Like any Marzen, it is quite light bodied (when you try to ignore the smokiness, of course). I probably have to admit that Rauchbiers are not my cup of tea - sorry, beer - but would still like to sample the Urbock as I imagine that a heavier beer would carry the smokiness better than a Marzen.

3108,"2002-12-11",3.3,"UPDATED: SEP 12, 2009 Dec, 2002 Bottle  Smokey and greasy - bacon then turkey with a touch of kippers. A little Lapsong Souchong (my favourite tea). The progression in the nose is: smoke (wow!) rancid bacon (ugh!) then sweetness like a decaying corpse (interesting!). The body is smoke (now a little chemical) grease (and here you reflect on all the smoked food products youve tried) and then the hops come in with the Lapsong tea taste (mmmm). The body is thin and is at odds with the power of the smoke. At one time all beers would have been smoke flavoured, but that would have been balanced against a very sweet ale malt base. Using the traditional malt smoking with the more recent cold lagering results in a pigs ear of a beer - neither fish nor smoked red herring. Interesting? No doubt about it. Your favourite beer? Quite possibly. World class? Jackson thinks so, and this is the most famous example of a smoked beer, so its certainly a must have beer. [2.9]

Sept, 2009 Bottle at Greenwich Union. Bottle had been kept in very cold fridge, so this took a long time to warm and find the flavours. The aroma is famous, and deservedly so - all sorts of smoke - wood, bacon, smoked mackerel. Taste (when it came) was chocolate - smooth and almost stout like. No awareness of hop bitterness, the bitterness balance coming from the smoke. There were old trainers and burnt rubber and treacle and malted milk biscuits and caramel. The flavour is decent enough, and I enjoyed the flavour more than on previous occasions. [3.5]","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

3108,"2002-09-24",3.6,"Well, I never thought I would EVER even come close to enjoying any kind of rauchbier.  The first time I tried it, 2 years ago (a different beer though I dont remember the name) it tasted absolutely vile.  The only reason my brother in law and I finished what we pourred was that we had paid 9$ for a 1/2L.  I got this same impression again - when i started drinking it (and smelling it).  Its like going over a smokey wet fire and taking a deep breath.  Once your palate gets accustomed (or saturated), you start to notice all kinds of rich malt flavours.  Im new to the style so it is hard to describe, but by the end of the bottle it was quite enjoyable and I could probably have been persuaded to have another. :)","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","dhurtubise"
3108,"2002-09-18",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 23, 2004 6/23/2004: The smoke character is still as I remember it, but the body seems drier and less sweet.  Smooth, thick and warming body finishes roasty and woody.  A very nice rauchbier.
9/18/2002: Pours a rich dark brown with tan head.  Upon pouring, smoke fills the room.  This style takes some getting used to, but by the end of the bottle, you only want more.  This beer would be even better if I could enjoy it with some sort of processed meat. Wait, I just remembered I have some Johnsonville Stadium-Style Brats in the fridge.  MMMMmmmm.  I microwaved them, but while drinking this beer I could've sworn they were grilled.  Nice balance of sweet malt with the smoke flavor.  Better mixture of flavors than the Aecht Schlenkerla Weiss.  This is a very respectable brew and a must try.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

The tap version at the Schlenkerla Ausschank in Bamberg is even a little smokier if you can imagine that, but also very drinkable. The lingering, coating smoke is beautifully blended with quaffability, and the finishing drying effect just makes you want to have more. As good as the bottle, though more quenching.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

I noticed that it got the lowest rating of the three, and I have to agree with this.  While this rauchbier is  very good, the other two are better.  This one is not as complex as the others.  It is very smoky, with a bitter smoke finish, but the beer itself is not tasted as much as with the other Schlenkerla offerings.  Still, I would take this over almost any beer in the world.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
3108,"2002-08-18",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2010 Bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly lasting. Body is medium to dark brown. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted dark bread, roasted grain), with a strong note of savory smoke (meat and wood). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Finally the Maerzen and Urbock are back in fine form after several years of getting poor samples locally...Id almost lost all hope.  The Urbock is assuredly more satisfying, and the Weizen more interesting/unique, but the Maerzen is a perfectly serviceable smoked lager, and more suited to quaffing than the Urbock.  Very high quality smoke character, combo of sweet charred wood and smoked meat...none of the acrid, cigarette ash smoke smell of lesser examples.  Yummy.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Flavour reminds me of a 10year old  Laphroigh (which I tried with the beer - nice pairing). Earthy, smoky, roasty on a nice maltbase. Is maybe a little thin bodied.

Clear burnt orange color with a tall lasting dry bone colored head. Smoked ham and cheese all over the aroma. Light sweetness up front, much akin to a glazed smoked ham. Enough malt in the front to ease the smoke in. Light dry finish with a mild linger of malt and coals.

3108,"2001-09-30",5.0,"One of my favorite beers.  This is the defining standard for all rauchbier.  Pronounced SCHLENK er la.  Most Americans dont like...leaves more for me!","USA","coloradobeerguy99"
3108,"2001-08-27",3.7,"Smells like an extinguished campfire, very much like peat and beef jerky.  Deep, dark cherry red, I was taken aback by the first sip, which left a lingering smoky aftertaste. As time passed, the smoky offensiveness did as well, leaving a tasty, smoked-ham beer with a creamy tan head.  The underlying sweetness never breaks through, surpressed throughout by the bullying burtness that gives this beer an identity unlike any other.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
3108,"2001-08-27",2.8,"Excellent cherry red color. Smells like smoked meat. Tastes like Lebanon bologna. If can get past that it isnt bad. Very smokey. Try it as something different, not on my to try again list though.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"
3108,"2001-08-11",3.6,"My friends and I refer to this as 
das hambier.  The first sip is 
completely disgusting.  After about 3
or so, you get into it a bit more.  Would
go well with sausages and/or cheese.  Not 
my bag.  I like weird beer, but not this one.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","booyaatribe"

The first sip is like inhaling a campfire...i didnt think i would like it...then as i have heard before on this beer...the smoke takes a back seat and becomes a compliment to the beer...which has a very decent malt palate and a smooth drinkability and finish...damn good beer!","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"

3108,"2001-07-29",4.0,"As was mentioned previously, theres a definite sense of bacon going on here. Ive had this before with Scotch where it wasnt a bad thing, and it wasnt a bad thing here. The smokiness balances nicely with the malt flavor, and it leaves a very light, smooth aftertaste.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
3108,"2001-07-26",4.5,"Aroma and flavor are wonderful, though I think a bit less complex than the Urbock.  More woody on the nose and hoppy on the tongue, a gorgeous deep red hue, and wonderfully smooth and silky going down.  This could be the best brewery in the world, folks.  Now for that Weiss . . .","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

3108,"2001-06-15",4.2,"This beer (and its sisters) are lovingly made by the Trums of Bamberg. They even malt their own barley, and kiln it over a Bocha (beechwood) fire. If youre ever in Bamberg, be sure to visit the Schlenkerla Ausschank, where this is served from the Holzfaß (wooden keg). Much more aggressively smoked than their Weizenbier (which is destined to also be a world classic).","New York, USA","lovibond"

3108,"2001-01-16",4.2,"Wow. I have to agree with an earlier posting regarding this a liquid smoke in a bottle.  What a different experience this was.  So much so, that I had to go out and get another bottle of it!  Very good.  Drink this while eating something heavy, like a pot roast or venison.  Very good.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","proc"
3108,"2000-11-08",3.3,"Zbrew said it: like liquid smoke in a bottle. I cooked with liquid smoke once and accidentally put too much on the meat - made me wanna puke. Thus, smoked beers always conjure up that memory - therefore they arent my favorite style. However, I can appreciate this beer for how well-made it is. I liked everything about it, except I thought the smoke flavor was too dominant and overpowering.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
3108,"2000-07-26",5.0,"First I will assume that this is the Marzen that we are evaluating. The brewery also makes an smoked Ur Bock, a smoked Wheat, as well as an unsmoked helles.

With that said, this is the standard that all other Rauchbiers are judged against. It has a wonderful smoked flavor that grows on you with each glass. It is the perfect beer to complement any smoked meat. Freshness is always a concern, although I have found that this beer does not suffer from age as badly as most.","Missouri, USA","Gambrinus99"
3108,"2000-06-23",5.0,"UPDATED: JUL 19, 2009 There are few pleasures in this world like Schlenkerla Marzen from the wood.  Oh sure, Ill take the bottles, but lets not kid ourselves, those are only a 4.7 or 4.8.  When you go to the ausschank in the Bamberg Altstadt, its different.  The glass lands in front of you. The appearance of the beer is a unique reddish-brown, nice and dark with a thick but not overstated head.  The aroma is pure smoke goodness, nothing more nothing less.  The palate shows incredible balance.  Yes, the smoke is huge, but so are the chewy, earthy malts.  The wood finishes the beer, lending it impeccable balance and drinkability.  Theres no need for writing expansively about the nuances and the subtleties...this is simply the perfect beverage. Perfect looks, great aroma, great flavour, perfect balance...finishes brilliantly.  The most perfect beer on the planet, on gravity from the wood like real beer should be.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

3108,"2000-05-09",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 5, 2005 Rerate deleting my naive first rating and first experience with smoked beer.  Aroma milder than I remembered, campfire for sure, make some smoked sausage, or the clothes of someone who spent too much time near the fireplace.  Flavor less sweet than I expected for a marzen, smoked or not.  Actually the palate was somewhat light and only semi-sweet.  I would say smooth, not watery, though.  Smoke presence clearly predominates.  Attractive dark ruby almost purple color, firm creamy head.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
