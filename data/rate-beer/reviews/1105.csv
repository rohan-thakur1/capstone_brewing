Aroma is fresh raspberry, vanilla, almonds, but in an extremely intense way, you can smell it from a distance. Taste is pure raspberry goodness with almonds and vanilla (but not really sweet), lots of depth and a citric sourness. Medium carbonation. An excellent raspberry lambic with lots of pure jam goodness, but also a good amount of depth!","Garching b. München, GERMANY","SinH4"
1105,"2017-04-16",4.4,"Bottle split 5-ways at Grote Dorst. Pours hazy red with a big pink head. Aromas of sweet and acidic raspberries, lots of vanilla, almond, light lactic notes and a subtle wet forrest-like funk in the back. Taste is very tart, lactic, vanilla, almondy sweetness, citric, lemony, sweet raspberries. Theres something about the vanilla and tartness that blends in a way I dont particularly love - not only in this but in vanilla sours in general. This is one of the beers where it works out better than usually, for me atleast. Still prefer the puur of all the framboos though!","Aarhus N, DENMARK","Klimaet"

Also some lactic cheesecake being noticed. Not good especially when I have access to multiple 3 Font and Cantillons at this establishment. Thin to medium bodied with ample carbonation. Bottle was also 45 euros when 7 year old golden blend was 20 and fresh oude geuze was 5 euro. Yup, Ill drink those.
