918,"2016-10-09",3.1,"Draft at Pi Pizzeria, Bethesda, MD on 10/07/16.  Arrived at the table a slightly hazy rust color with a skim of a beige head.  The smell was a little stale with some wet cardboard, orange juice, caramel, and a bit of a graininess.  Went down thin to medium-bodied.  Tasted like it smelled - stale/skunky and watered-down.  Some caramel and sweet grains were present upfront.  There was a little orange juice and some zesty citrus rinds at the end.  Completely forgettable.","Washington DC, USA","lamas"

918,"2012-02-16",3.9,"Tasted on tap at Pi restaurant in Kirkwood, Missouri, USA into shaker. Poured a nice, clear orangish-copper color with fluffy white foam which subsided to a persistent layer of bubbles and lots of lace. Brewed in the California Common style, one of the only true American originals, a historical technique to emulate popular lagers in warmer ambient California temperatures, typified by Anchor Steam of San Francisco. Spicier hops than I expected, and in interesting ways: mint, cedar and licorice-root from the Marynka and piney citrus rind of Chinook. Great well-rounded mouthfeel, even a hint of rye-like sharpness. Overall, an excellent true-to-style recipe. As delicious and complex as Anchor Steam, which is saying A LOT, albeit in slightly different ways. Anyone who expects more from this beer really doesnt understand the style. I also like the double meaning of ""Common,"" keeping with Pis mathematics theme. I dont care what anyone says: all things considered, this is another ""uncommonly"" tasty Schlafly brew. The ultimate pizza beer, which was the whole point. Recommended.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"

Pours a moderate golden color with a good white head and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose carries some light grain and perhaps a touch of fruit.
