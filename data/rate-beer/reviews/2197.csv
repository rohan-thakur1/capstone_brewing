Light sweet, light bitter finish, straw. Not your typical Märzen, but to be honest Id prefer this take on the style above a more traditional example any time.","Baarle-Nassau, NETHERLANDS","Martinus"

Flavor is light malty sweet, light bitter, some fruity sourness. Light bodied, but not thin. Finishes with grain and a moderate bitterness.
