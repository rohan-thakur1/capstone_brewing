1910,"2016-11-13",3.3,"Bottle. Fresh grapefruit aroma. Pours golden with a medium sized frothy white head. Mild bitter flavour with notes of grapefruit and limes. Medium body with a crisp bitter finish.","Calgary, Alberta, CANADA","RobBestwick"
1910,"2016-10-14",3.7,"Bottle, sampled at Medicine Hat Beerfest 2016 and several times thereafter. Light orange, off white head. Bright zesty citrus hop character, kind of made me think of lemon-lime, with lean malt structure and a dry finish with mild bitterness. A touch thin, but very bright and drinkable.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
1910,"2016-09-21",3.7,"Appearance: clear medium gold with one finger of rocky white head, good retention and moderate lacing. (4/5) Aroma: bright pithy citrus, vinous, biscuity pale malt, tropical and stone fruit, grass. (8/10) Taste: moderate sweet, moderate bitter. (7/10) Medium body tending slightly watery, moderate carbonation, short mildly bitter finish. (3/5)

This starts off quite promising, with bright fruity hop aromas dominating upon decapping. The flavours dont quite deliver on that, though, and the body tends slightly to the watery. This remains the case through the entire pint: the aromas stay bright and promising, but it stays just a little light on the tongue. Ultimately, it sort of comes across as a somewhat watered-down IPA (albeit a really good IPA). The APA style has always struck me as being a bit of a challenge, and this beer definitely characterizes that. I enjoyed it, but kept feeling it could have been better. (15/20)","CANADA","UXO"
1910,"2012-10-08",3.8,"pours cloudy amd amber with a thin white head. Bold hop aroma, very pacific North west.Very creamy, citrus, grassy bitter. It is a buffet of hop character. An excellent brew.",", Alberta, CANADA","Cole"
1910,"2012-09-27",3.8,"Draft at Wild Rose. Pours cloudy deep orange, with a decidedly green cast, which makes me excited because it means HOPS!!! Nose is quite hoppy, lots of grass and cedar but there is some snappy hop juiciness here too. Flavours of big hop bitterness, nice yeast, nice malt bill, really earthy snappy hops here. Really nice!","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","Savvy1982"
1910,"2012-09-12",3.2,"Keg at National beer hall. It pours slightly hazy orange-amber, with a small white head. The nose is citrus pith, cereal, dough, soap, peach and lemon. The taste is hay, straw, weak citrus fruit, lemon, grapefruit and light soap, with a bitter-citric finish. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Alright.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
1910,"2011-05-27",3.6,"A really nice pale ale; fresh and hoppy taste. The pour is a light golden orange, mostly clear with a thick finger of creamy white head that dies to a thin cap. Tons of lacing remains well after the head has disappeared.  The aroma is hoppy upfront with a good amount of citrus hops and a moderate malt backbone. The finish is bitter and lingers for  a little while. A delicious and tasty pale ale (especially when as fresh as possible).","Alberta, CANADA","patricks110"
1910,"2010-08-28",3.2,"Quite hoppy, nice red colour, a lot more flavourfull than expected, its almost an IPA. Quite dry, very tasty, fades out clean.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","TheHulk"
1910,"2010-07-25",3.5,"Medium amber color. Nice hoppy aroma with floral notes. Fairly hop forward, easy drinking, lingering bitter finish. Not overly complex, but just a nice go to Pale Ale. Was great on a hot summers day at the brewery.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
1910,"2010-05-30",3.5,"On tap at the Ship and Anchor. Pours a clear golden yellow with a thin white head and medium carb. Good citrusy nose with just a hint of caramel underneath, but the aroma was not as big as I was expecting. Grapefruit, orange and a biscuit-like sweetness start off the flavour before transitioning into herbal, green leady hops and a moderate bitter finish. Not at bad pale ale at all.","Calgary, Alberta, CANADA","Maltybones"
1910,"2010-05-11",3.0,"I was kind of looking forward to this event. The weather did not hold up and luckily we got a table inside. Luck of the draw I had the very nice cask version first. My rating is based on the less desirable tap version. The cask with ""different hops"" was very good, very nice fruity hop flavour and dusty airy malt. The regular version on cask was more malt, less hops and forgettable.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
1910,"2010-05-08",4.1,"Had this last night at its Official Release at the Wild Rose Taproom. Wow. Poured a light golden orange. Nose is filled to the brim and overflowing with an absolute melting pot of herbs and candied fruit. No change at all from nose to mouth. Explosion of the freshest herbs and spices coat every inch of the mouth. The hops are dominant yet not even remotely over-powering. Long worn leather mixes in slightly with a definite kick of maltose. Sweetness is abundant by the back of the palate but the finish digresses to forest plants and warm spice. This one truly was fresh and green and was a pleasure to explore! Only complaint was the ever-so-slight slight over-sweetness.","Calgary, Alberta, CANADA","Powertrip"
