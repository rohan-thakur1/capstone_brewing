This may be the best Dark Lord I've had considering the circumstances as well as how it wasn't as thick as the Malort aged but was way more potent and burning, and more flavorful to boot. Really, this one was a treat and I'm lucky to have stuck around to try this rare brew. Would have again but probably won't have again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"

The aroma is big chocolate malts and bourbon. A lot of oakiness and vanilla. Heavy soy comes through on the end, especially as it warms. The flavor is good, but its dominated by soy sauce. There is a nice malt and chocolate with a great bourbon coming through. Oak and vanilla are delicious but the soy sauce is a touch off putting. The mouth feel is thick and viscous with a heavy soft carbonation. The soy sauce dominates. Lingeringly thick and chewy with a completely controlling soy sauce again on the way out.

5.19.15 2015 bottle lots of sweetness but it takes away the harsh overly sugary molasses of the regular dark lord. Touch of Cherry. Not much barrel character in there.  Liked the 12 with 2 years age on it better. Seems to be about when these peak.

Black pour with a thin light brown collar. Thick oily residue left in the glass. Very thick ABV legs

Nose is dark fruits, vanilla, bourbon, wood, chocolate, caramel,coconut, and subtle soy sauce. Some alcohol but well subdued. Fruits really stand out well.

Might as well just copy and paste the above remarks. Barrel really shines in this beer and hides what makes Dark Lord a meh beer. Dark fruits, chocolate, vanilla, coconut, caramel and other fun notes. 

Thick and coating. Low carbonation, big body, well balanced. ABV is there but it is later that it catches up to me. 

Bad ass beer. One of the best bourbon treatments I have had.

2010 vintage, served side by side with Dark Lord and Vanilla Bean Dark Lord.

Oak Aged Dark Lord pours a near jet black, with hints of brown visible at the upper edges of the glass when held to the light. Head and lacing are somewhat subdued, but given the serving medium, I couldnt ask for more. A great big aroma of rich roasted malt and oak barrels. Wow. Dark Lord is one of my favorite beers, and I find the addition of oak barrels to be quite wonderful. There is a prominent licorice note in the taste. Someone described the feel as ""oil slick in the gulf"" and I have to agree. Thick and chewy, this beer leaves a coating of stout residue in your mouth that utterly blankets the palate. This is remarkably smooth, given the high alcohol (it is higher this year than previous vintages), and gives a nice, warm burn as it slides down. I really hope I can go to DLD next year and get some of this fresh from the tap.

Pint in a plastic glass at darklord day. Dark viscous black with a nice creamy mocha head. This was like dark lord on steroids. Lots of booze, oak, vanilla, chocolate. I really felt that this overwhelmed the original version - and at least the vanilla bean version balanced things out. Definitely a full body, no idea on the carbonation since the mouthfeel was highly viscous, like motor oil, sweet and alcohol on the palate, long lasting but quite powerful finish. I know that people love this beer, and maybe its become more balanced over time, or maybe newer versions are just better, but I actually gave away parts of both cups I got during the fest because I just found them to be overwhelming - and this was after I had been sampling beer for 4 hours!

Its apparent that the Dark Lord improves with age as the sweet notes that were once overpowering become more subdued letting other flavors share the limelight - rich, dark chocolate, cherries, molasses, light tobacco, smoke, and of course coffee notes. With the Bourbon-aging, the DL is perfected.

The nose is darkly roasted malt, molasses, brown sugar, light coffee, and the vanilla, cinnamon, barrel, and bourbon flavors underlying.  The flavor is lightly sweet up front with vanilla and molasses, moving to the more roasted malt flavor of dark chocolate, and finishing with more vanilla, cinnamon, oak, and whiskey, with no real coffee flavor to speak of.

The aroma is really decadent and complex with soft whiskey and oak laden vanilla all atop a nice blend of burnt caramel malt, dark chocolate, and mocha coffee. Hints of star anise adds some nice balancing spice. This thing just smells fantastic. The flavor follows and maybe not quite as impressive as the nose, but still fantastic with notes of dark chocolate cake, burnt caramel, roasted coffee followed by the whiskey boozy influence. The anise adds some nice spice, and the oak imparts its signature vanilla character. Full bodied, dense, and oily, but slightly thinned from regular Dark Lord and very minimal carbonation no doubt due to the hand bottling. Roasted coffee and bourbon soaked oak linger on the finish.

This was a very nice imp stout, but it gets no where near the quality and depth of the vanilla bean version. Hard to say to what it is about those vanilla beans. On the aroma, notes of strong bourbon, sweet vanilla, rich chocolate candy bars, mixed powdery wafer malts, and a wonderful nutty caramel. It definitely intrigues you from the start. The appearance of this is basically identical to the vanilla bean version so Ill copy and paste that description: ""Zero head from the pour. Black. A dark wood colored outer ring with some small stagnant carbonation bubbles. As thick as it gets, and rather mysterious looking."" The palate here is slightly harsher than the other two versions. Thick and creamy, but much more boozy. To describe the taste, its like sweet vanilla chocolate cake, cream on the top, consumed with a big glass of bourbon/whiskey. Bold.

Huge aroma of chocolate, fudge, chocolate cake, chocolate syrup, vanilla and caramel. Inhaling anywhere near the vicinity of a glass of this is like walking into a chocolatier. Unbelievably sweet and decadent. Oak and bourbon are noticeable, but the chocolate/caramel/vanilla trifecta is dominant. The taste is brimming with rich chocolate and vanilla, molasses, licorice and oaky tannins. Bourbon is there too, well-integrated and balanced with the base beer. The body is thick and viscous, carbonation non-existent. The finish is mildly tannic, roasty and semi-dry, coffee lingering on the palate. Its amazing what a little -bal aging will do to a beer.

Draft. Poured a pitch black color with minimal head (Im sure the plastic cup helped with that). Smells like DL but with huge hints of the oak barrels. Subtle sweetness. Slight smokiness. Adding the DL to the Oak barrels was a great move that only added additional complexity to this beer. Would be great to see it bottled instead of having to drink it from a plastic cup at DLD.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"
3437,"2010-06-05",4.3,"Sampled at the 3 Floyds event at the Brickskeller.  The brewer described the flavor as ""umami.""  Pours a totally viscous, opaque black with zero head.  Initially it smelled like cough syrup, once it opened up you also got vanilla, heavy wood, whiskey, licorice, burnt toast.  Flavor is nutty, wood, brown sugar, chocolate, dark fruits, toasted breads, strong bourbon, cherry juice.  Finish is full bodied and still a touch hot.

The pour is darker than dark with a brown swirly head on top. This stuff is so thick it sticks to the side of the glass. The smell is incredible; tons of chocolate, roasted coffee, oak, vanilla, bourbon, a nutty smell, a sweet sugar-like smell. The flavor is so complex and and layered, with one smell/flavor coming one after the next; the layering is so incredible. So full bodied that your mouth feels sticky afterwards, but so tasty too. It is an extraordinary beer. However, I wish it could be aged, because after drinking an aged normal bottle of DL compared to an unaged bottle of normal, there is such a difference.

3437,"2010-05-13",4.0,"A: The pour is viscous and black with just a bit of tan foam around the edge of the glass.

S: A definite oak and bourbon presence to the nose without the intense sweetness Dark Lord usually has. Certainly some sweet chocolate and vanilla with a bit of dark fruits.

T: The oak aging gives this one a bit of a tannic character and some bitterness that the original does not exhibit. The bourbon, vanilla, and oak flavors are quite strong but still allow the chocolate, roast, licorice, and dark fruits to show.

M: The body is thick and chewy with a low, smooth carbonation.

I savored this sample for the next 30-45 minutes, as I made my way through the crowds.  The pour was thick and brown-black like molasses.  The aroma was intoxicating, with a faint whiff of alcohol, coffee, dried fruit, and caramel.  The malty sweetness combined with the coffee notes was superb.  Heck, Id almost put a bit of this on a bowl of high quality vanilla ice cream (if I was insane, that is).

I didnt have to wait in line for it.  I switched it over from the plastic cup to my Duvel glass, not that it was going to make a huge difference.  Pours a super dark brown; I didnt see the pour itself to appreciate the motor oil stream that the Dark Lord normally demonstrates, but it sat in the glass opaque, with nice rich brown highlights on the edges and a little brown head.  Damn near perfect on aroma and flavor.  Notes of rich dark chocolate and creamy milk chocolate, molasses, coffee, dark fruits, brown sugar, peat, and incredible oak and bourbon notes from the Woodford Reserve barrel.  Not much vanilla came through for me, but the wood seems to be mellowing the sweetness of the normal Dark Lord.  Low carbonation, and a smooth, rich, woody, oily mouthfeel.  Full-bodied, though Shawn and Mike are saying this is thinner than last years version because it uses the 2009 vintage and not the 2008; Ill buy that, having done a 5-year DL vertical with them, and thats probably the only thing keeping this from being a perfect 5 for me- well, and the plastic cup.  Its so close, though; this is one of the best things Ive ever tasted. Re-Rate: 2012 release, bottle 505/688. Its a little sweeter and not as good as the 2011 version, which I tried a few nights earlier and confirmed my rating. The 2012 is still amazing stuff but wouldnt rate as highly.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3437,"2010-05-02",4.3,"Served on tap at the FFF brewpub on DLD. I was fortunate enough to get a seat at the bar to sample the 2 big one-offs. The oak aged poured a high gloss midnight black with no real head (This were being pre-poured so any head that was there had not lasted.) The aromas pour out of the glass with heavy bourbon, almost as strong a a glass of the Woodford Reserve on the rocks. The flavors are also overpowered with the bourbon initially. Loads of rich roasted malts, vanilla, espresso, chocolate.  As the beer continued to warm the bourbon subsides more and more (or intoxicates more and more). It is truly a shame that this isnt bottled because an extra year mellowing out the bourbon and letting the complexities to continue to grow would make this brew even more out of this world. A true treat and worth the trip from SoCal.","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"

Bourbon and oak flavors dominate the aroma. More bourbon and oak in the taste, with notes of chocolate and alcohol. Thick and syrupy mouthfeel with a dry cocoa finish. More alcohol flavors in the finish. I realize drinkability and availability are different, but given the beer is only available 1 day a year for a 3 oz serving, Im not sure how drinkable you can rate the beer. Saying that it pairs really well with my Italian Sub that I got standing in line doesnt quite sound right.","Miamisburg, Ohio, USA","chaz01"

Poured a deep dark oily jet black with a thin tan head, though mostly only visible with faint agitation.  Not so much bourbon as vanilla on the nose, chocolate and light coffee.  Chewy dark fruit and big chewy tannins.  This was so very, very good.  Worked out that I liked this one better and my friend liked the vanilla, so once wed tried both, it made sharing very easy.  Chocolate and cherries, toffee.  A bit warm on the finish, light vanilla notes.  Huge dry oak lingers around long afterward.  Very good.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

Pours as black as the BeerAdvocate website background, and as thick as Aunt Jemima syrup. A well-formed brown head sits on top and leaves some lacing on the glass...er...plastic cup.

The nose on this one is out of this world. So much going on. It smells like a rich chocolate cake, along with coffee, roastiness, candied fruits, oak, and bourbon. Even puts regular Dark Lord to shame here.

Flavor is similarly amazing. The sweetness of Dark Lord really mellows out with the oak aging. Lots of milk and dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, brown sugar, and candied plums and raisins. Oak and bourbon blend seamlessly and do not overwhelm in the least bit.

Incredibly full-bodied and rich on the palate. Carbonation level is medium-low, exactly as appropriate for a beer like this.

Overall, wow, this is unbelievably good. Ill knock it down a half-point on the drinkability just because its so overwhelming, but as drunk and full as I was, I had no problem taking down the 6oz pour. (Wish it hadnt been so easy!)

As I swirled this around the cup, it left an oily residue on the sides... this stuff is definitely thick and viscous. The aroma is amazing... you really need to take 5 minutes just to try to pick out all of the smells in it. I was able to smell a lot of chocolate and fresh coffee, bourbon, oak, burnt wood, vanilla, nuts, and sweet sugars. The taste is also brilliantly complex. It has a wonderful sweetness that balances out all the other complexities. I picked out a lot of bourbon and oak at the beginning and some vanilla, chocolate, dark dried fruit, nuts, and burnt wood. I was floored with how well all of these flavors meshed together... this beer is almost too easy to drink.

3437,"2010-03-21",4.1,"Ive had this two years in a row in a plastic cup pour. I took some brief notes this year, so here it goes - a lot of this will be complementary to my review of Dark Lord (when I finally get around to reviewing the regular variety). Some of this text is borrowed from my Vanilla-bean review, where appropriate.

A - Think quick-dissolving mocha foam, nice ring of lace, pitch black with a hint of red at the edges. Its about all I expect from a 13% RIS.

S - Oak-barrel, but not the stupid amount I experienced in oak-aged Behemoth. Theres also a touch of vanilla and almond that I get from most good barrel-aged brews, plus the cadre of ""regular"" Dark Lord smells. Its different from regular Dark Lord, but not a huge improvement.

T - I found the oak-aging to simplify the taste of Dark Lord in a way that wasnt altogether positive. The oak-aging really brings out the booziness and heat and smooths out a lot of the really interesting flavors from the regular Dark Lord. Its still pretty delicious, but just slightly acerbic.

M - Thick, near milk-shake consistency, with tons of residual stickiness, and low carbonation. This is the way RISes should be down - other brewers take note.

D - This is a mild step in the wrong direction - takes the least drinkable elements of Dark Lord and amplifies them a little bit. Its hot, palate-beating, and not really much more interesting than the regular variety. Worth trying, but not worth waiting hours in line to try.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","MasterSki"

3437,"2009-10-03",4.4,"Nip handbottle, courtesy StFun. Pours completely pitch black, thick and viscous looking with a tiny patch of dark brown bubbles at the head. There is no lace, though the sheeting practically stains the glass brown. The aroma is absolutely incredible. Vanilla bean creme brûlée immediately comes to mind, as do notes of softened whiskey and oak, all atop an already decadent blend of burnt caramel, chocolate cake, and mocha cafe. Hints of licorice and anise lend ample spice, completing the near-perfect  nose. The flavor has the nearly impossible task of living up to the beautiful scents that eminate from the glass, and accordingly, it falls a bit short.  Still delicious, and based in rich chocolate, caramel, and roasty coffee, the sharpness of the whiskey barrel and the anise tends to come across on the boozy side. Sweet, scorched marshmallow works nicely with the vanilla laden, toasted oak barrel notes. Very faintly carbonated (though that is no doubt the handbottle talking), the palate is dense and oily, ever so slightly thinned as compared to the base beer. Coffee, anise, and bourbony wood intensify on the sharp finish. Though the barrel influence changes the character of the brew considerably, it remains signature Dark Lord through and through.

Nose was a very potent and pleasant mix of aged wood, pourbon, chocolate, toffee and caramel, and as it warmed, the alcohol snuck in as well. Mouthfeel was full, a tad biting and oily. Taste was the highlight, as it took all the scents of the nose and blended them into a very complex taste where every sip seemed to accentuate a different aspect.

Finish was log, smooth and warming. FFF served this in small cups, which was a good thing, given the various beers to be tasted and the 14% abv.","Dacula, Georgia, USA","kimcgolf"
3437,"2009-05-02",4.1,"On tap at DLD 09. Pours a black body with virtually no head. Just a slight brown lacing on the edge with some nice, soapy lacing on the glass. Aroma is quite similar to the regular DL, but with much more of a bourbon woodiness than vanilla. The vanilla is still clearly evident, but its much more subdued. Some silky chocolate and woody hops with a mild citrus bite. The flavor is very mellow from the barrel aging. Nice, smooth wood-bourbon, rich chocolate (although not nearly as rich as the regular DL), some mild background roastiness, and a light to moderate amount of bittering hops balance this out nicely. Never gets extremely bitter. Good amount of molasses, but not nearly as big of a flavor compared to the regular DL. I also found the fig stood out a little more in this one. The flavors stay bold and balanced without approaching an over-the-top status. Full bodied with a slow, drying finish. Much softer than the other two DLs. Lingering aftertaste of very rich wood, bourbon, and vanilla-cocoa. Overall, a very solid beer. The oak and bourbon are pretty big, but IMO work nicely with this monster and accompany the complex assortment of flavors quite well.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

The oak aged DL is darkness embodied, of course. The entire glass is stained, top to bottom by the residules. Almost no head. Just a lace ring around the top. Tastes of bourbon, butter toffee, black figs, leather, smoke. But really, its like trying to describe the ocean if youve only ever experienced a puddle.

3437,"2009-04-27",3.3,"On tap at DLD. Here we go again. I first had this hand-bottled (or Factod, you might say) two years ago, and though I enjoyed it, it was clearly unrateable. Ive finally had a chance to try it for real and was actually less impressed than from the hand-bottle.

Lets get something straight here. I really, really want to like this beer. I want to love this beer. Id be happy with it in my top 10, because Dark Lord remains one of my favorites to this day, and this has every opportunity to make it better.

But it doesnt, of course. In fact, it makes it much, much worse. It nearly ruins it. Complexity is not normally a word you throw around with 14% imperial stouts, but after tasting this you will recognize that the unaged version is indeed complex, if only because this is so utterly dominant in boozy and bourbon characteristics in both flavor and aroma that almost nothing else can be sensed. A bit of sweetness, perhaps. A touch of roast. But thats about it. This is as strong, harsh, and brutal as they come, unforgiving and ruined by the barrel. 

I guess it is to be expected that an unrestrained beer would have a barrel treatment as unrestrained as the initial brew, but it doesnt change my opinion that no matter how big the beer, going light on the bourbon barrel does far more good than using a heavy hand.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

Flavor follows suit, with bourbon, vanilla, wood, and chocolate nicely balanced in the forefront, with dark fruit and espresso notes in the background. Huge bodied and very smooth.

Flavor is an explosion of the same - dark chocolate covered cherries, coffee,  with oak and bourbon.  It starts sweet and then slowly the bitterness of the roasted malt and hops kick in for an incredible finish.  Mouthfeel is as thick as it gets, but leaves you wanting more... incredibly drinkable.

Initial is smooth, emphasizing sweetness and coffee much like regular Dark Lord, but pushing some nice vanilla, oak, and whiskey. Refreshing, not overly boozy, great body that is thick and palate sticking. Leaves a lingering sweetness and roast bitterness on the palate, full and good flavors and very good body.

The flavors are intense and include roasted malt, chocolate,coffee, caramel, vanilla,oak, bourbon, and anise.  There is a dark chocolate like bitterness.

Which in my book is just thin enough to prevent you from being able to use a fork to eat it and no thinner.  Which is exactly how thick this beer was.  Unlike most bourbon aged beers, this one was perfectly balanced.  The earthiness of the oak completely took over the beer while the dark lord’s original flavor seems to have muted the bourbon’s typically buscuit-like flavor.

In long: Bourbon is overwhelming and kills all the complexity that the regular Dark Lord has.  Gone are the rich fruity flavours, chocolate and all.  All I was left with was some kind of lifeless port wine with a shot of expresso.  Very flat carbonation.  Alcohol more apparent than in the regular Dark Lord.  One hour later I even got myself a second 6oz sample thinking there was something wrong with my first sample.  Nope, same simple brutal beer (and I use the term beer very loosely).

So, much hype with this beer, makes it hard to rate, but here I go nonetheless.  Poured black (duh), aroma is molasses and bourbon.  Taste is much the same, big and sweet, heavenly mouthfeel, more of a wall of taste than anything, hard to pick the flavor apart brick by brick.

MASSIVE oak and bourbon nose but surprisingly did not cover up the other subtleties...dark fruits, vanilla, dark malts, tobacco and coffee.

Left thick brown film on the glass as you swirled it. The smell was almost nothing but bourbon. The smells underneath were very good vanilla and some dried fruit if you could find them under the bourbon. Flavor was almost one deminsional: Bourbon. At first you picked up very sweet sugar and some vanilla masked with bourbon but within seconds your whole palate tasted bourbon and the taste lingered longer than anything ive ever had. The mouthfeel was wonderful, almost like syrup or a melted milkshake, very sticky. If you got this on your hands it was like pancake syrup. Overall, nice experience, but way too much bourbon, i wanted to taste beer.","San Diego, California, USA","tool2scream"
3437,"2008-04-28",4.5,"Sample at DLD 08.  Extremely black with no head.  Swirling leaves the plastic cup stained brown.  Thick looking.  Bourbon is the first thing apparent in the aroma.  The bourbon definitely overpowers the other aromas but it is not overdone, the aroma is still quite pleasant.  Same old Dark Lord smell underneath if you focus on it.  Very balanced smell.  Taste is an explosion of sticky sweetness and mouth coating goo.  The bourbon is immediately apparent then the chewy, chocolatey malts finish.  Perhaps the longest finish of any beer Ive ever had.  I was licking my gums for minutes tasting this stuff.  Obscenely full bodied.  I dont know how but this seemed like the thickest DL Ive yet encountered.  The flavor is a little over the top.  The sweetness of the bourbon combines with the already sweet beer to become a little much.  I kept envisioning drinking corn syrup and the texture doesnt help eliminate this image.  The bourbon flavor also kind of overpowered any of the subtleties of the regular (yes, there are some subtleties) and made the beer less complex.  All in all this was quite incredible but the drinkability is certainly very low.  I had to share my little cup.  I am very glad to have gotten to try this but I prefer the regular version.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

Update:  8-5-11 Huge thanks to Brian for sharing the Pappy.  Funny this is lumped in with all bourbon variants.  So why does bourbon county rare get its own?  Makes no sense.

The nose was huge and filled with expresso, chocolate and porty overtones.  In the mouth it was the most dense, thick, syrupy, oily beer I have every tasted.  While the alcohol lever is high (15%) and you know it is there, it is never hot.  The flavors from the nose burst into the palate covering every nook and cranny.

Nice aromas of vanilla and bourbon, with oak coming into play as well. There was also some roastiness, but the vanilla and bourbon seemed to be the strongest. Taste is a blending of vanilla, maple syrup, bourbon, wood, with a finish of some coffee and bourbon. Mouthfeel is thick and very smooth, the bourbon seems to almost lighten it up just a tad, however. Carbonation was on the lower side of medium. Great beer, and probably even more enjoyed in the winter months by a fire, but this sample was enjoyed out in the sun at DLD.

Take a base of one of the most brilliant imperial stouts and do a masterful job of bourbon-barrel aging.  The bourbon doesnt overpower, but rather compliments.  Layer upon layer of complexities slowly reveal themselves from the first sip to minutes after the final drops have left your palate.  The brilliance lies in the fact that each flavour component does not outshine the other.  Hops stand up to balance out the malt backbone.  The bourbon makes an appearance to lend a hand complimenting the oily viscosity on the palate.  The finish is left with vanilla, oak and a residual stickiness that allows one to enjoy the experience well after the fact.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"

Aroma: BOURBON, sweet anise, chicory, slight oakiness, alcohol...  I cant wait to try this stuff!
Appearance: BLACK, no head at all.  Thick and syrupy.  It looks like it would stick to anything and is doing a pretty good job coating the entire inside of the cup!
Flavor: WOW!  Instense and complex all the way...  Roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, chicory/coffee, anise, vanilla, wood, a hint of smoke.  Mild bitterness level.  The finish has a very dark chocolate flavor and is a bit more dry than expected, but still wonderful and it helps to balance out the initial sweetness.
Palate: FULL bodied.  It is as thick as it looks with an oily texture that really does cling to everything.  Needless to say, it coats the mouth nicely for a lingering flavor and long-lasting enjoyment.
Overall: AMAZING!  Truly phenomenal and well worth the drive, standing in line, and the cost!  This is a MUST try for all beer aficionados!","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"

All the flavors are foreshadowed by the aroma perfectly.  I love the balance here--and the barrel aging doesnt ruin the already great taste of Dark Lord--but enhances it.

Four absolutely amazing beers in a row.  And this my friends topped them all. ........  Pours a thick thick black clinging to the glass with thin brown head.  Nose of cherries, red fruit, chocolate, roast, oak, bourbon, molasses, and so many other rich scents.  So complex and rich.  Full bodied, viscious like pudding, creamy smooth.  Chocolate, fruit, coffee, molasses, espresso, all the notes in the nose but bursting now on my tongue.  This beer is so alive and intense on my tongue the thick black espresso to red and ripe fruit.  Why did I not drink this until I could no longer stand.  That is my only regret of that day.   The best beer I have ever had to date. 9/5/9/5/19


Ive had many versions of this over the years.  As DL seems to go down, not surprisingly, this has too.  I thought 10 DL was some of the worst to date, and therefore at DLD11s BA version of the DL also suffered.

3437,"2007-05-02",4.6,"Draught split with Tronraner during my Dark Lord excursion. How do I approach something with this much hype? I excitedly received my glass of this ambrosia and marveled at how solid and black this stuff is. Ive seen only a handful of imperial stouts approach a level of this opacity and viscosity. Even standing out in the sun light, there is not even a real red hue to speak of. The aroma is powerful, just huge of molasses, vanilla, espresso, hickory, chocolate. Yes, its very obviously barrel aged, but when the original characteristics of the brew are so bold, its hard for this to be too mellow or too much like just sipping bourbon. So, excellent balance in this blast to my nose is achieved. Taking a sip of this is almost like sipping paste, but the most delicious paste Ive ever tasted. There are things that really appeal to me in a beer and its as if 3F brewed this specifically for people like me. Roasty espresso hits the mouth with rich molasses, madelines, chocolate, hickory, soil, and some light piny hops buried in the wave of rich, heavier flavors. This is a damn fine example of hiding the flavor of alcohol. It just warms up my sinuses a little bit, only adding to the experience. The most impressive thing about this beer is that despite the sheer magnitude of aroma and flavor, perfect balance is accomplished and nothing becomes cloying. Some people say that its just too rich, but for me, its the perfect threshold of intensity.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
3437,"2007-05-02",4.3,"Draft at DLD.
Served dark as night with only a slight ring of head around the perimeter of the glass.  Smell is absolutley luxurious.  Deep roasted malts, chocolate, and bourbon are the front runners. This is a big beer, no doubt, the alcohol is there and warming.
This beer is mellowed a bit by the oak aging.  Not the brute that the DL bottle is.  This is a great beer, but not huge and robust as say a GI BCS.
The guys at FFF have taken barrel aging to a whole nother level.  Other brewers could take notes from them.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AllAboutStout"
3437,"2007-05-01",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2011 Draught at 3F at Dark Lord Day. Pours pitch black with an orange-brown head and intense lacing. The aroma is unbelievably appetizing. Molasses and bourbon dominate, but there are plenty of espresso and smoke notes as well, some dark honey, and maybe chocolate and vanilla. The flavor is intense molasses, espresso, and roasted nuts. Bourbon barrel char comes through, but it has to work to compete with all the other strong flavors. Tons of earthy hops, earth in general (peat?), and super-smooth whisky come out in the finish, which leaves an aftertaste that doesnt ever seem to go away. A nice vanilla smoothness rounds off the edges. Its very impressive that all these strong, potentially overwhelming flavors can be brought together so harmoniously.

3437,"2006-09-15",4.4,"When every one lined up to get their bottles, I headed straight to the bar to get a little low-ball of a terrific beer.

This beer came a mirrored obsidian with a small collar of tan and copper head. There were also a few mysterious wisps of head swirling about the surface. 

Smelled of gentle fruity bourbon, dark creamy chocolate, maple syrup, chocolate pudding and a warm, aromatic alcohol that hid behind the bourbon and an oak dryness. As it warmed, the alcohol became very (overly?) prominent, but carried with it a sweet vanilla. 

Tasted of pasty, rich chocolate pudding that took root in my tongue and turned it brown (seriously, I checked). Through this floated an electric tingly sting of flowing woody bourbon, fresh cut oak and a Jagermeister-like herbiness. I also got some sweet marachino cherry and creamy oak burps! Never had a stout do that before! Sadly, the alcohol was hot to the point of becoming distracting. 

The mouth feel was heavy as hell with a thick creamy viscosity added by a micro-fine carbonation giving this the feel of pudding. Wheres my spoon! 

This ones just a trip. The alcohol was a little much and could stand to be aged for a while. Hopefully, FFF has a keg of this sitting somewhere waiting to be cracked in a year or so. A cool version of this would be off the charts!","South Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","DTB"

The nose on this was pure Heaven... deep, dark, and remarkably evil Heaven... rich espresso, bakers chocolate, vanilla, oaky woodiness, sweet bourbon sugars, and wisps of dried cherry skins... couldnt have asked for any more.  The flavor was carried by rich and expertly-blended dark malts (the aforementioned bakers chocolate and burnt espresso, prunes, figs, and cherries), older oak, sweet vanilla, and hints of bourbon.  Fiendishly smooth on the palate with waves of its underlying power accenting during the drink and warming through the finish.

Theres definitely an oaky, bourbon kick to it, but the bitter chocolate and roasted coffee flavors still take the stage similar to the bottled Dark Lord.

3437,"2006-06-16",3.5,"Draft: Browned ebony. Tight and creamy caramel foam. Deeply toasted oak, vanilla fudge, marshmallow, and caramelized sugar aroma. Nasal searing bourbon and perfumey tannins. Body is colossal. Oily and viscous. Carbonation is overly prickly, though, and a hindrance to the bodys sensuous viscosity. Chewy onset of fudge is tempered by tingly tannins and a vibrant toasted oak dryness. Clings to the lips and seals them shut after a single sip. Charred malts steadily heighten and interact with the underlying oaky echoes while ink doused plums and molasses saturate the palate. Bourbon is prominent throughout and the alcohol weighs heavily on the palate as the flavors progress. Consequently, the pronounced char goes by the wayside. Rich java never loses its strength, however. Finishes continually tingly with tannins and a burnt caramel backdrop accompanied by a mere glimpse of roasty dryness. Rather redundant in terms of the molasses and overt fruitiness. That, coupled with the prickly carbonation and the fact that the bourbon and alcohol overshadow the nuances and a large portion of the malt goodness, leaves something to be desired. A nice treat to have on a special occasion, but not much more than that.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

The bourbon was there, no doubting it, but it didnt overwhelm every other flavor like some of the other BB aged beers i had that weekend.  the body was beyond thick, it was so viscous and chewy that i think a stirring straw could have stood up straight in the middle.  i managed to drink 2 cups of this, and dont think i could have handled any more, its one of those beers that is very very good, but there is too much of a good thing if this were bottled.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","richlikebeer"

Your fingers get sticky on the outside of the glass.  This must be sipped.  Flavors of dark dusty chocolate, bourbon barrel, vanilla and coffee.  This is almost too thick to drink comfortably.

I was worried that after tasting so many brews, that my palate would be destroyed by the time the doors opened. A bunch of water and some bread helped out alot though. I was lucky enough to get a sample before they started serving it in plastic cups. Anywho, aroma is fan-f*@#$ing-tastic. Loads of bitter chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oak, bourbon and hints of fruit. PERFECT. There was little to no head, just a faint swirl of carbonation at the center of the glass. I was surprised to find that the beer almost seemed a tad thinner than the regular Dark Lord, which would mean that it is still thicker than anything youve had. The flavor is very surprising. The aging really mellows out all the complexities that Dark Lord is so well known for. But dont let that make you think that this isnt a phenomenal brew. The flavor is still wonderfully complex. An abundance of bittersweet chocolates, dark caramels, fruits, vanilla, molasses, and finally bourbon followed by a nice hoppy bitterness and somewhat port-like sweet finish. This brew is fantastic.

One of the better barrel beers that Ive had. I dont give out perfect scores, and the only detractor was that a small fleeting head would have fit the style better. Undoubtedly this was from the re-bottle so figure my appearance score upwards in your head if you choose to.
Black, oily and coating the glass as its swirled.
Rich alcoholic yet restrained bourbon aroma. Notes of licorice and raisins come easily. This is one that can be enjoyed for the aroma alone. I dont like bourbon, but there is plenty of good Imperial Stout aroma so that the bourbon doesnt take this one over.
Thick, sweet, smooth and very well balanced by roasty bitterness. Again, very well done and one of the better attempts to meld a Big Imperial Stout and a barrel that Ive had. Thanks Matt for the chance to share and try this one!","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"

That said, this beer is far from bad with its black hole opaque vision and beautiful oily cling to my snifter. The nose detected black strap molasses, vanilla and almond extract, french oak, raspberry, salty and mineral vapors with of the Dark Lord character of bakers chocolate and espresso.  The flavor is rich on mocha components blended with the high octane bourbon overtones. Just some of the flavors found were vanilla, walnut, snappy hops and charred espresso beans. Lots of alcohol too, perhaps too much which seemed to take away from the wonderful lingering aftertaste I have associated with DL. It seems to have thinned out the palate as well. That was Dark Lord domain, over-the-top lushness and oily sticky coating. Now it just seems like a good imperial, not all that.

Beautifully complex aroma of roasted coffee, bakers chocolate, bourbon, oak, raisins, brown sugar, molasses, and Im sure Ive missed something other than the plastic from the cup.  Full and robust body but, alas, still missing that oily mouthfeel that made the 2004 Dark Lord so exceptional and caused you to continue tasting it long after you swallowed.  So many things gong on in the flavor, teasing and tantalizing ones taste buds.  Rich and full notes of coffee and chocolate and bourbon.

3437,"2006-05-03",5.0,"Sipping a big goblet full of this black, oily, hazy topped berzerker, I pondered the whole madness surrounding the recent Dark Lord release fiasco.  The forum threads had a circus-like atmosphere with ugly attitudes and greedy tones that made me feel like I was reading a forum completely foreign to me.  I wanted a case of Dark Lord and I wanted to try this barrel aged beer, which contains every bit of chocolatey, rough espresso edged goodness I expected, delivered in a malty, oaky, alcoholic envelope of teeth clenching bourbon., warming my stomach and sticking like glue to the sides of my tongue.   Personally, Id rather not stand in line for $180 worth of beer that I used to get in $20 growlers, but I completely understand supply and demand (I often spend $250 on an urban vinyl toy that sold-out for $100 just minutes before).  I rather enjoy when the pub is filled up and rowdy, too, almost as much as I enjoy its quiter moments, but the thought of seeing the people who had recently caused such goofy fury on the forums and being directly associated with that forum made me rethink the reasons why Ive been a member of ratebeer for the last 50 months.  For the first time I didnt want to go to Three Floyds directly because of my association to Ratebeer!  Rating beer was a lot of fun, meeting people was tenfold the fun but now I feel that the ratings and racking of numbers and boorish forum behavior has cheapened the experience for me.  I can honestly say that I didnt want to be a part of the Ratebeer group that rallied at the Pub last weekend.  I value many of you as friends on an individual basis, so I hope Im not coming off sounding elitist or rude. I have met a ton of great people because of Ratebeer and will continue to keep in touch with many of the people here, but through emails and other routes.  I also found myself using Ratebeer forums as an outlet for my own grumpiness sometimes and thats not what this site is supposed to be about.  Im not putting anybody down here, these are my personal thoughts and nobody is being singled out.  I will move along through the World of new beers on my own, with fond memories of the great times here at Ratebeer.  Joe & Admins, keep up the great work and Ill continue to point people to this site, like I have for over 4 years now.  Ill buy you all pints when I run into you!

A thick,dark black with creamy dark brown head. Mild bourbon, dark chocolate and alcoholic aroma. Bourbon immediately hits as you drink...but the coffee, chocolate and vanilla flavors come soon after. Very, very tasty. Thick as hell and the taste lasts forever. 
 Im loving the BA stouts...and this is right up there with Full Sail Black Gold as one of my favorites so far.","Seattle, Washington, USA","glkaiser"
3437,"2006-05-01",4.4,"Enjoyed two glasses of this stuff at the Floyds.  Black body, dark brown head.  Sweet hersheys dark chocolate aroma with tangy roast underneath.  Some bourbon fruitiness.  Big acidic dark chocoalte plus deep sweet milk chocolate, some dry roast in the finish.  Theres a big caramel sweetness in there as well but theres a lot of other stuff (chocolate, roast and bourbon) to mask it.  Patent acidity and bouron pear/apple fruit as well as alcohol heat, too.  A classic examplar of the BA Imperial Stout style. Its not pushing any boundaries but no matter - its delicious.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
3437,"2006-05-01",4.3,"I did enjoy this malty beast for more than an hour, savoring all it had to offer. 
Aroma: Bourbon, mocha, bitter chocolate, toffee, vanilla and slight burnt cherries.
Appearance: Opaque with dark brown head and some sticky fine webbed lacing.
Flavor: Bursting with dark chocolate, mocha and powerful bourbon. slight notes of vanilla came through on the palate as well. The body seemed to be a little more lean than the original.
Palate: Full in body with sticky sweet malt that had a slight warming effect as it ran down the palate.
Overall: A fantastic variation of the original and I hope to tase many more BA Darklords in the future!

 I would say this one certainly lived up to its expectations.  pour was as black as night with a tan head which faded quickly.  as people walked around the 3F parking lot it was readily apparent whenever someone had the Oak Aged DL.  nose was in the cup and a smile on their face.  a great balanced blend of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, oak and brown sugar.  not quite the full-mouthfeel I expected but still had a nice slick, oily feel to it.  delicious!","Quad-Cities, Illinois, USA","barleyPops"
3437,"2006-05-01",4.6,"What can I say that hasnt been said?  I spent about 30 mins at least sipping my 6oz.  It poured a slick oily black with a dark thick head.  Aroma was chocolate and bourbon mixed with coffee and caramel.  Flavor was bourbon chocolate truffle.  A nice bite toward the finish lets you know theres a lot happening in there.  Overall I cant argue against it.","Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA","Firemoose15"
3437,"2006-05-01",4.8,"Impenetrable.  Opaque.  Obsidian, blanketing the glass and seemingly sucking light from all thats around it.  A creamy, thin, deep khaki tan head resides on top.  Dark mocha fudge hits the nose, paralleled with tracts of bourbon and Godiva liqueur pumped into delicatessen dark chocolate, caramel laden turtle candies.  The bourbon is a major player, but its more of a first violinist rather than a soliloquy.  The currant, tar and other black earth elements from the non-barrel aged vintage dont consciously resonate.  That being said, its still salvation for the nose.Letting the liquid gracefully enter the mouth, we can effectively say that this is a perfectly barrel-aged beer.  Dry hop bite and black patent seem to take a steak knife to the tongue.  Thick, oily toss of the fluid seems to make it ooze even more slowly over the tongue.  Espresso grinds come up big, sweetened by this dark chocolate liquor accommodation.  Its oppressive, but a welcomed tyrannical dictatorship.  Heavy caramel accents intertwine with a bitter dark chocolate character for a hearty espresso grinders day in paradise.  When it fades out from the mildly carbonated and chewy bourbon/chocolate sluice, weve got some dense pound cake qualities thats choc full of flavor and enhanced with greasy mocha grinds, not to mention the dark chocolate fudge and liqueur-laden Dove chocolate bars.  Quite a bitter and fiery flick at the tongues tip on its way out, and it seems to devilishly pry open a few of the tongues weaker taste buds and ignite them with a peppery flare.  Thick, palatable justice in the hard-to-halt viscosity.An absolute pleasure (and thanks to my wife for her allotment as well!)  The barrel does supplant some of the intricacies that help to orchestrate the cadences within the traditional Dark Lord vintage, though this barrel aged beer would be any delicatessens dream to craft an ale in such an awe-inspiring manner.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

3437,"2006-05-01",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 4, 2006 I wanted to like this more. Even with the massive Dark Lord and the big tastes there, the bourbon still managed to play a big role in this beer. I also found Surly Klaus to be dominated by the barrel aging. On tap at the brewpub 3Fs DL day 2006. The body was black with a thin orange head. The aroma was mushrooms, molasses and some strong bourbon. I also got the coffee notes. The taste was dark chocolate and too much bourbon. There was also coffee and a woody dryness in the finish. I prefer the regular Dark Lord.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

Anyway, poured a pitch black oily color with a very thick creamy brownish beige head.  Aroma was a beautiful combination of slightly burnt molasses, dark rich chocolate, cherries,vanilla,bourbon,oak and alcohol.  Flavor was a complex and very rich combination of dark chocolate,marashino cherries,expresso,vanilla, oaked bourbon and warm alcohol.  Excellent !!!  This needs to be bottled and produced in larger quantities.","Doylestown, PA, USA","adrian910ss"
3437,"2006-04-30",4.0,"Draught, 2005 version  sampled after a year in the barrel: darkly opaque black garnet with a strong and full, chocolate head.  Fairly complex aroma: burnt coffee bitterness, dark chocolate, vanilla and molasses soaked in alcohol and exuding bourbon sweetness.  A year in the wood has created an incredibly soft, smooth and velvety textured liquid.  On the tongue, a significant amount of the high-alcohol harshness has been retained, along with underlying charred malts and some residual hop bitterness.  Light sour cherries mix with vanilla and bourbon sweetness.  Pretty impressive that a beer can actually hold up this well for a whole year in a whisky barrel, but if anything could.very enjoyable, but I do like the regular Dark Lord a bit better","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"

3437,"2006-04-30",4.0,"On tap at the brewpub.  Pitch black and as dence as a Hooters waitress this beer packs a significant punch, albeit one dimensional.  Bourbon and oak are present and not overbearing as I feared but the complexity seems to be limited to the barrel aged attributes and the original stout qualities become to muted.  Solid beer but indistinguishable from other barrel aged stouts.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ElBorracho"

The bourbon is there, but its done right -- not overwhelming, enhancing and rich. Its rich and viscose with plenty of semi-sweet chocolate, mocha fudge brownie. If theres one flaw, its that its hot on the finish. Still, excellent, and hopefully well see bottles of this next year. There were a few bourbon barrels stacked behind grain.","Illinois, USA","Philip"

Black as hell. Just dark, and oily. The smell is coffee, caramel, nuts, hops (go figure) and acrid bitters. Hint of anise too.
The taste is rather balanced. Thick as hell too. A lot like Founders KBB in its bourbon/coffee balance. I really thought this would have a lot more grip to it, but it is deadly smooth.

3437,"2006-04-30",4.1,"My bias was that this would be overwhelmed by the oak and bourbon, but that was a foolish concern...The Dark Lord does not need his hand held.  The 05 vintage had mellowed a tad, not quite as aggresive in the alcohol burn of the finish.   Some oak and bourbon notes, becoming more prominent as it warms.   My only negative, and it is a small one, is the texture seems to have thinned out just a touch.   But certainly a very fine example of the brewers art.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"

Very tight brown head with black appearance. Highly viscous mouthfeel. Temperature effects did accentuate the bourbon nature as time went by, but only enhanced the deepness of flavors in another direction. From chocolate-coffee-cherry to oak-leather-alcohol bitterness.

3437,"2006-04-30",4.2,"Thick, robust black with a huge, charred brown head.  The aroma was pretty sweet, full of bourbon, vanilla, burnt grains, light coffee, tons of cocoa, some light caramel, mild carbon/charcoal, woody tannins and more whiskey/alcohol.  The body is big, syrupy and smooth as hell, with definite barrel-aged smoothness.  The flavor is sweet with definite signs of whiskey-barrel aging; however, the charred malts and coffee elements still maintain some presence.  Im generally not a huge fan of whiskey-barrel aged anything, but this has been one of the better examples.  The hugeness of the base Dark Lord is enough that it is probably the best candidate for long-term aging in these sorts of barrels.  Pretty damn good.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

3437,"2006-04-29",4.4,"The fact that this beer was served far too cold, in a small plastic cup, and STILL tasted awesome is a testament to its greatness - rather than making it ""bourbon flavored Dark Lord,"" the barrel aging made this an entirely different beer (if I went in cold, I would not have guessed it was DL) - the extreme hop profile and dry, piney character was replaced with a smooth, semi-sweet vanilla and mild oak flavor - the brashness of the original, probably toned down by normal aging, was mellowed even more, leaving it just as flavorful, but much more delicate (dont worry, its still hardcore enough to kick the living crap out of you) - however, I think the beer may have been left in the barrels just a bit too long - as the beer warmed, the bourbon actually began to overpower the beer - now, I love bourbon, so this didnt phase me, but for some, that may be a negative - overall, probably not as good as regular Dark Lord, but still a hell of a beer.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
3437,"2006-04-29",4.4,"I was a bit dissapointed by the choice of plastic cups for this beer, and at $6 for a 5 ounce pour I wasnt too excited. Thats neither here-nore-there and has no bearing on the wonderful taste that gripped my tounge.

The aroma on this filled my nose with deep oak and burbon notes, some hints of chocolate and an ever so slight hint of cherries. Dark almost roast like flavour with a bit more chcolate and heavy notes of burbon soaked wood. I detected some coffee in there, maybe a bit of vanilla as well. Having the privledge of trying this next to 04, 05, 06, I cant say i liked it as well as the 04. it did add a lot of wonderful notes and gave it a great character with tons of complexity.

With great trepidation, I got my 5 oz plastic cup of Barrel Aged Dark Lord and transferred into my new tasting goblet.  The result was a light sucking black colored liquid with a beautiful tan head that stubbornly stuck to the side of the glass.  After admiring it, I took a timid sniff.  A very rich and complex bouquet of coffee, caramel, cherries, fresh sugar cane, vanilla and Makers Mark greeted my eager nose.
After much debate, my first sip bestowed many pleasures upon my virgin tongue.  There was first a wave of freshly whipped high grade chocolate, ground Kona expresso beans and bourbon.  Next came impressions of vanilla beans, more bourbon notes and dehydrated cherries.  On the third wave came creamy smooth expresso blended with figs.  Finally, after all that, there was a long lingering combination of everything wrapped up in a sublime package.  Its too bad that I was only able to try this once.  It was an extremely amazing experience that is all the more special because it is so hard to come by.  It also happens to be my first perfect rating after a few months of exploring the universe of fermented beverages.

Black as night with a brown head.  Chocolate flavor, sweet and roasty with a bourbon soaked cherries, caramel, dried fruit and a warming finish.  The fruitiness grows and the cherry flavor is a little overwhealming after half a glass.  The finish has an earthy, roasted feel to it.  Full bodied and very creamy.  The barrel aging is a good thing for Dark Lord.
