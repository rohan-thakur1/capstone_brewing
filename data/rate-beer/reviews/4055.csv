Unfortunately its a bit old bottled in February. Would like to rerate if possible. Pours bright orange hue with a small rocky soapy white head and sparse lacing. Nose is floral citric and slightly oxidized. Im sure this was a very bright beer when fresh. Citric slightly astringent hop flavors . Long big citric bitterness on the finish with lingering pale malt husks. The hop combination would have been great when fresh.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
