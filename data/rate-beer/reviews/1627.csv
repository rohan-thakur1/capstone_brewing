1627,"2015-07-06",3.9,"[ Bottle ][ 4oz ][ Sushi Kaito Encinitas ][ $8 ][ Sake Shooter/Bento ][ 6.15.15 ]
>> Clear water color, delicate aroma of lavender, cantaloupe, honeydew, rose. Taste is super clean with no bite, no vodka like flavor, mild rose and lavender, low sugar and cantaloupe fruitiness. Super easy to drink with a longer, lightly tangy aftertaste. Really great sake for pairing with sushi.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
1627,"2014-05-16",3.2,"Bottle, 18cl. It pours a clear, oily body, completely colorless. Citrus notes, some alcohol and rice, litchi and pears in the aroma. Pretty pleasant, but the flavor even more. Theres citrus and litchi in the mouth as well, some canned pears and rice, as well as a sublte anise and cellar note. Its oily, full-bodied and lighlty warming on the palate, finishing mostly fruity. A tasteful and complex one, well worth a revisit. 140515","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
1627,"2012-03-12",3.1,"got this bottle b/c is was small.. still managed to get my 90 pound girl friend drunk after a few glasses though. Pour is crystal clear, grains and rice on the nose and booze. Some light fruity characteristics, but mostly its just clean and clear. Paired with sushi, of course.","New York, New York, USA","zdk"
1627,"2011-11-20",1.9,"First sake so this might not be a proper review. 300ml green twist off

It pours clear with no head and a few bubbles on top.

Smell is decent. Light sugar, maraschino cherry, some fruitiness.

The taste is decent. It is very dry, not too much sweetness, but it is there. It does taste like sugar though. Lots of alcohol and ripened fruit. Smooth, uncarbonated mouthfeel.

Ehh, this sake stuff is okay, this one seems a bit meh though.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
1627,"2010-08-08",2.0,"Absolutely clear, like water. Very faint aroma: light sweetness... indiscernible. Flavor is light rice, glue, and light fruit. Watery - feels thinned out. Very very light.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","hershiser2"
1627,"2009-06-01",3.1,"Pours clear with a hint of yellow. Aroma of rice and yeast with a touch fruit. Smooth grainy rice body with hints of sweet fruit, slightly dusty fruity taste. Decent ginjo.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
1627,"2008-10-14",3.0,"180 ml bottle in NYC.
Clear, a little yellow.
Fruity, lemon zest, a little vinegar. 
A hint of over-ripe fruit.
Very clean flavour, but it ends up too sour for me.","Oslo, NORWAY","KnutAlbert"
1627,"2008-05-14",3.2,"Pour is clear...lightly alcoholic and sweet nose...very perfumey alcoholic flavor...hot...","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"
1627,"2008-03-17",2.8,"Very clear with some well defined legs on the glass. Strong alcohol aroma with maybe some pinapple. Taste is very strong alcohol with a bit of banana and vanilla to round it off. Somewhat unbalanced and not too pleasing to drink.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1627,"2008-03-08",3.0,"(Bottle)  Pours a transparent body with a very slight green/yellow tinge.  Mild aroma of alcohol, steamed brown rice, chestnuts, and  light grass.  Flavor is mostly alcohol with  vanilla, hard water, and almond.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
1627,"2008-02-25",3.5,"Nose is sweet and sour. Pours a clear color. Tastes like citrus a bit and is very sweet and soft, almost watery. Alcohol content is amazingly hidden. Pretty nice but I am no saki expert.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
1627,"2008-02-08",3.3,"cocnut, some rice, very light alcohol aroma also....clear as can be ... quite sweet and pleasant, but lacks something.. alcohol is hidden very well, for 15-16 it is a dream ... i can see this going well with a spicy dish... overall: a nice easy going simple sake but i have had better for cheaper, a good starter sack!",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"
1627,"2007-09-03",2.6,"Clear still white.  Nose held light fruity notes with touches of flroals and steamed white rice.  Initial rubbing alcohol flavors slowly warm to anise and ricey notes.  Light bodied with loads of alcohol.  Might as well have been the standard warm Ozeki.  Way to rough around around the edges...","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
1627,"2007-06-23",2.6,"(180ml bottle) Purchased at the BC Liquor Store. Pours a clear, lightly viscous body with a nutty (waterchestnut) and alcohol nose. Flavour is mildly syrupy but a wet almond nuttiness.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
1627,"2007-04-01",2.8,"Slight greenish hue.  Aroma is fruity, woody and alcoholic, with light florals.  Dry palate with straightforward notes of alcohol, light rice and only a hint of wood/florals.  Its all sort of vague, which is not a good thing...too simple.  The dryness handles wasabi well but overall the experience both with and without nigiri is a bit flat.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1627,"2007-01-29",3.5,"UPDATED: FEB 11, 2007 180mL Bottle: Drank out of a masu (my first time). Poured a clear color. Nose of clean banana and koji, light pine (compliments of my tasting vessel) and some sweet peach skin notes. The flavor has a moderate alcohol feel to it with a balanced acidity and a touch of umami. Neutral seimaibuai too. Fairly bland, which to some could be a good thing. Alcohol and light butter in the tail. I like a bit more umami to my sakes.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
