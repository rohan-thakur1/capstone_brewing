2382,"2016-07-21",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Piney hops and toasted wood allusions summon quite the forest, all the way to a minty fresh bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A healthy head of foam covers the shiny amber haze.
-The soft richness of the mouthfeel is one of the beers best features.
-Hops also share oranges and flowers.
-Its a shame oxidation seems to be setting in even though there are 9 months left before the best before date, according to the label.
-This must be excellent fresh, on tap.
