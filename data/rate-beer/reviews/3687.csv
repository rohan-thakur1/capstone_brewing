3687,"2016-01-04",3.9,"Bottle, thanks to grownfool. Reddish., with no head to speak of. Smells nice - bourbon and vanilla. Taste is winey-er than I expected, some grape, some more bourbon. dry, woody finish.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
3687,"2015-02-03",2.7,"Bottle into a snifter. Muddy milk chocolate-brown. Bubbles come and go within seconds, leaving a still-looking liquid below. Smells almost sour. Lots of vinegar, green oak, green apple, white grapes, caramel, cherry. The flavor, however, is kind of light, not much to it. A green apple tartness. Splash of sour cherry. Very highly carbonated -- its almost hard to pick up the flavor with all these bubbles keeping the beer off my tongue. Light body, no noticeable alcohol. Meh. Too highly carbonated, weak flavor.","","PartyFowle"

3687,"2014-07-16",4.0,"Bottle. Clear red amber, large beige head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving some lacing. Aroma is vinous, red wine, oak, cherries, supplication, perhaps a touch of funk. Really nice. Flavor is not quite up to aroma, but still very nice, Oaky vinous, tart cherry notes. Light initial sweetness dries out quickly, leaving light tartness. Minimal funk. Lightish body. High carbonation is a distraction. Let this one sit a bit. Ahh, gains a bit of funk from the dregs, as well as a cloudiness. Better rounded flavors that way.

Mild weight with some dryness in the finish. Carbonation was a little below average. Good mix of flavors with a tartness being ever present. Grainy notes with a fruitiness that was subtle. Not much of a hops presence. Interesting.","The Colony, Texas, USA","kevinator"

3687,"2013-04-06",3.4,"Cloudy dark amber beer that pours with a small to non-existent ring for a head. It has an enticing clean aroma like lichens on a stone after a sweet rain. The taste is perceived as sour malt with an oaky red wine character. The mouthfeel has a strong punchy bite thats fizzy, subdued, and a little tart. I cant even tell how strong this is so its easily drinkable esp. b/c the initial taste reminds me of a sour presukably from the wine barrel aging. Very good.","austin, Texas, USA","kidmartinek"

3687,"2013-03-08",3.8,"Not much head results from a pour of this barrel-aged beer, even when vigorously poured.  It looks just like a Christmas Ale, deep, thick amber in color but nowhere as clear as the original Christmas Ale is.  It smells rich with cherries, but shy of a cherry-like sour red ale, somewhat thin on the nose but potent and still easy, smooth.  A light, pleasant wild yeast aroma adds to the noses complexity, but doesnt control it.  The beer is light-bodied, but powerful in the mouth.  The flavor is controlled by a slightly soured cherry flavor that ends up complimenting the beers winter warmer-like malt body very well, almost as if Saint Arnold Christmas Ale was mixed with a sour red.  What a great idea that would be, and although thats not what they did, it sure tastes like it.  Kudos to Saint Arnold for doing all of that rough legwork in taste-testing all those barreled beers, mixing and matching them, and for having the good taste in deciding on this mix.  Totally unlike Bishops Barrel #1, this is another great idea for barrel aging, yet still not too out of this world, obnoxious, or a far stretch at all.  Modest and easy, but still still of character and manages to pull off a clean and clearness despite the short-lived sour, wild finish.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"
3687,"2013-03-02",4.3,"12 oz. bottled poured into an imperial pint glass. Served room temperature. Tasted on 2/1/13.

Appearance: Head is nearly nonexistent, and what there is of it diminishes very quickly. There is no lacing. The body is a clear ruby. This is all absolutely consistent with the type of beer. The acidity in the cherries kills head retention, so that is to be expected.

Aroma: A fairly one dimensional nose consisting mostly of sour cherry, or cherry and some citrus acidity. However, the cask wood, which is present, does pleasantly bring the nose back to balance.

Palate: An excellent light body, which makes it very drinkable. The same mouthfeel as a Pinot Noir. The texture is thin with a slight effervescent tingle at the front end.

Flavor: The flavor lingers, which is great. It is moderately sweet to balance the cherry, but not so sweet that you lose the funk. It is appropriately funky and acidic; there is nothing too harsh.

Overall: I would drink this beer again and again. Im thoroughly impressed by this beer. This is the best thing I have tasted from St. Arnolds, which is something, because everything they make is wonderful.","Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA","LaTrappeMonk"
