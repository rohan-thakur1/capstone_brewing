Almost none existent head. Malty with a high roasted aroma. The roasted taste malt milder in the taste with a firm bitterness and small caramel touch.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","TEJA"
3289,"2015-12-10",4.0,"Draft at Zoiglstube Kramer-Wolf: Orangish golden with some haze. Broken, nonuniform white head. Clean and enticing aroma of minerals, airy phenols, lemon cookie, aniseed hoppiness, marmalade, honeysuckle and dusty, claylike yeast. Brisk, slightly spritzy carbonation. Bracing minerals link up with lively hop acids and sweet honeyed toast on initial sip. Fluffy underpinning of pils malt supports the weightier cookie notes. Very ripe and nearly ""green"" hoppiness infuses the body with an abundance of nectar, while peach puree esters bump up the succulence. Lemony oils sizzle as they disperse their elegant, mouthwatering juices. Spicy, tealike hop bitterness continually provides perfect balance, with hints of lemon beneath. Saliva-inducing long-boil piecrust flavors emerge from the deep and refined pils malt. Staunch minerals bring more firmness to the notably lean body. Malt supplements the leanness with a host of body-building starches and rich cookie. Finishes dry, haylike, and dusty, with subtle marmalade stickiness capped with an abundance of oily hop nectar and mild melanoidin presence. Belches beautifully, as rustic sulfur and peppery phenols appear late. A Hallertau-charged lemon and flower BOMB that juggles elegance and rusticity as adeptly as any Zoigl to be found in Oberfalz. Top-tier stuff right here!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

3289,"2014-11-12",4.2,"Draft at Zoiglstube Kramer-Wolf in Falkenberg, from the front of a barrel but likely a bladder or line to keg. Hazy gold with a large bubbled white head. Clean, semi sweet with pronounced bread crustiness, a strong core of toasted grain livened by apricot jam Noble hoppiness. Herbal / floral touches with quiet sulfuric mineral character. Medium bitterness and medium+ acid, its hearty and rustic while staying clean, delivered by fine, creamy carbonation leading to a rich, lengthy malt sugar finish. Savory with lip smacking crispness and lingering nuttiness of shaved almond and caramel-drizzled pastries.
