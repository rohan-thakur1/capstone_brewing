522,"2017-01-22",4.5,"Got in a trade with The-Adjunct-Hippie. 12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/15/2016. Pours slightly hazy reddish/pinkish/orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light pink head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big tart/tangy cranberry, raspberry, cherry, lemon, green apple, red grape, hay, straw, grass, pepper, oak, wheat, cracker, light leathery funk/vanilla, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of cranberries, fruity/funky/acidic yeast, oak barrel, and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart/tangy cranberry, raspberry, cherry, lemon, green apple, red grape, hay, straw, grass, pepper, oak, wheat, cracker, light leathery funk/vanilla, and yeast/oak earthiness. Moderate fruity/lactic tartness and light yeast/tannic oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart/tangy cranberry, raspberry, cherry, lemon, green apple, red grape, hay, straw, grass, pepper, wheat, cracker, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of cranberries, fruity/funky/acidic yeast, oak barrel, and moderate pale malt flavors; with an amazing malt/tartness balance, and zero astringent/puckering flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp/dry, acidic/creamy/grainy, and lightly tannic mouthfeel that is insane. Absolutely perfectly balanced. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 6%. Overall this is an insane fruited sour ale! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of cranberries, fruity/funky/acidic yeast, oak barrel, and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the modest acidity. Absolutely perfectly balanced flavors with incredible complexity. A highly amazing offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

The palate is light bodied and highly carbonated. Flavors of strong cranberry with a light sweetness and moderate tartness. Not puckering - well balanced flavors all around and fruit forward enough to keep it interesting.

522,"2016-08-15",4.0,"12 ounce bottle from Woodmans in Beloit, WI (July 2016) sampled cold from the refrigerator in a New Glarus flute. Pours a fine-bubbled translucent dark pink with largish fizzy diminishing head, fine lacing; looks sort of like watermelon juice or I suppose watery cranberry juice....nose is prominently tart/sour/funky, with fresh fruit aroma there, but subdued, along with a little dry honey and thyme...while the aroma is perhaps a little more lambic or sour, I think the designation as a fruit beer will show to be correct to most people when they get to tasting, as the sweet-and-sour cranberry dominates from the start, with an initial lightly honeyish sweetness fading rapidly as a huge tartness comes in to finish, with a light white wine character intruding upon the nasal passages as the beer slips down the throat, and a touch of pepper lingering...strong carbonation, juicy, medium-bodied mouthfeel. For me this is not quite on par with this brewerys best fruit beers, but it is pretty special in its own right, and the finishing mixture of huge tartness, white wine dryness, and peppery spiciness is really something quite wonderful. This is my second four-pack and Ill likely get a couple more; most of their fruit beers age quite well and interestingly, and this is likely no exception.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
522,"2016-08-14",3.8,"12 oz bottle I got as a extra for proxying a trade for Brian. Shared with ebone1988. 2016 vintage. The pour is a darker ruby color, lightly foggy, with a light pinkish head that falls to a collar leaving a good bit of aoapynlace behind. The aroma is interesting. There is a soft cranberry and a nice tart sourness. The fruit is nice and juicy and the tartness light and crisp. The flavor is really sweet. I was hoping for something that was a lot more tart. The cranberry is definitely there and in high volume, but its too sweet. The tartness really is relaxed, and this is almost like a sugar-heavy juice. The mouth feel is lighter and pretty syrupy. The carbonation is light and a little softer. The aftertaste is definitely sweet cranberry, and carries a little tartness. Its an interesting beer for sure.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

522,"2016-07-26",4.0,"Bottle poured in tulip. Deep reddish pink. Light pink head that dissipates rather quick to a thin ring. Smells of tart cranberries and faint funk. Grass, old danky wood. That dry lambic smell you love. Tastes of mild sour cranberries and starts out semi sweet from the fruit but balances out to be quite dry as it finishes. Mouth puckering at the end but just enough. Could be more sour but that's just me. Medium to high carbonation and light body. Nice beer.

Aroma of toffee, caramel, oak, even some chocolate, along with the expected cranberry fruit. Smells pretty rich, not a huge lacto tartness here that I would expect from something claiming to be in the lambic style. Flavor is lots of funky cranberries, plenty of sweet caramel malt, oak, and a bit of metallic oxidation. On the sweeter side with light tartness from the fruit. Medium plus body with high prickly carbonation. Very much in the style if their big fruit beers, and less so in the lambic/wild/sour category. nevertheless, a nice little fruit beer.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"

To oversized cognac snifter, it pours a peach-tinted clear goldenrod yellow with which a whitish-ringed head stood. Froth soon dissipates leaving behind a syrupy, sparkling soda-liquid liquid.

Tastes the same (save for wallpaper and electrical tape), raspberry chewable vitamins, blue agave syrup, elderberries, and dandelion petals. Alfafa blossom honey, candle wax, and, strangely, tomatoes experienced at swallow. No kidding - definitely tasted umami by its sticky finish.

522,"2014-10-07",3.3,"The beer is an oddly bright coppery orange. Theres a reddish, pinkish hue to it, particularly evident on the small head. It seems to be rather clear, which I didnt expect. The aroma has a very nice sour quality. Cranberry is just a bit much, and a tiny touch of cough syrup comes out from the sweetness of the fruit. Otherwise, the beer has a very nice funky, fruity sour aroma. Very mild malt note. Light oak. The taste does not live up to the aroma for me. Its sharply acidic. Theres also too much sweetness and more of that fruit cough syrup flavoring to it. It just has a funny sweet and sour character that I dont particularly like. It tastes like someone put a funny fruit syrup in a strongly acidic but decent sour. The sharp bite and lingering sweetness drown out the initial bright fruit and funk/oak complexity. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky with a sharp vinegar acidity in the back of the throat. Just doesnt work for me.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

522,"2012-11-01",3.9,"April 16th, 2011 - The capital R next to beers Ive loved and enjoyed is always a sad sight. Dusty bottles of the stuff may be aging in far-flung basements, but in the here and now, its unlikely Ill ever see that beer again. Its not unlike saying goodbye to an old friend, with a kind of permanence that is rare in todays connected world. Outside of death, its a rare feeling for my generation. So, Ratebeers R makes me unusually maudlin when I see it, and even more so when I see it pinned to a great brew, like the New Glarus Cran-bic. White head with a pink blush, and a fox-orange body with some pink hues at its core, its a pretty beer, all gussied up for the ball. The sharp smell of cranberry, true to the beers name, defines the character of the bouquet, but doest monopolize it. A shot of cherry can be found, too, and the sweet smell of strawberry preserves. The flavor, like a Tolkein dwarf, is short and fuzzy, and less like a Tolkein dwarf, watery with a refreshing aftertaste. Its the perfect balance of fruity sugars and a kiss of cranberry, with a tight, crisp aftertaste and overall refreshing quality.

T - Tart and sour cranberry juice initially. This is followed by barrel notes of vanilla and oak. The finish is yeasty with a bit of spice and cinnamon. Funky notes linger around with the mouth puckering tartness. Mouth feel is spritzy and medium bodied, almost syrupy. 

O - New Glarus makes some of the best fruit beers in America in my opinion. This is an awesome cranberry wild ale. Really tart and refreshing. I wish I had access to this stuff.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Nice crisp body to this beer. Light carbonation on the tongue. Flavors of tart cranberries, green apples, barn funk, and a touch of wood on the finish. This was really good.

The flavor has plenty of cranberry character, but also a good amount of cherry.  Sweet, tart and acidic with some subtle spices thrown in.  Noticeable carbonation.  This was a treat!","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
522,"2012-03-23",4.1,"Poured a hazy, yet glowing golden orange. Very small head that disappeared quickly. Smells of cranberries, tart, slight yeast, and a little funk. Starts out semi-sweet and tart, nice creamy mouthfeel, and a moderately tart/sour finish. I wasnt getting much of the cranberries at first, but as it warmed they became much more apparent. Very nice sour and what a great value. Delicious, pour me another glass please.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"

Its a subtle and pleasing aroma.  Taste is initially apple vinegar, but after a sip or two the cranberries show up.  Its tart, bordering on the edge of sour and finishes with a blend of vitamin C and apples.  Quite refreshing.  Palate is nice - crisp, dry, somewhat high carbonation.  Seek this one out.  Its delicious!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","readbaron"

Funk, hints of barnyard, some cheesy notes, but all with a beautiful fruity note - this is pristine!  Oh, wait, I actually have to drink this to fully rate it?  Incredible combination of raspberry/cranberry/tart fruit and the sourness one would expect.  There is a sweetness to this that complements the tartness/sour nature of this brew - again, amazing.  Palate is just about right - medium to borderline full for the style and just the right amount of carbonation.  Sweet on the palate, lasts with a residual dryness.  Came into this with high hopes, and left stunned - great beer!","Valparaiso, Indiana, USA","valpoaj"
522,"2012-03-07",3.4,"From notes.  First reviewed 8/29/2011.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip. 2011 batch.

Cran-bic has an amber cherry color with a tint of peach when the light hits the glass right. The bubbles of a medium white cap pop and fade fairly quickly, but there is some lace left behind.

Cranberry is the most prominent in the nose, but there a few other aromas here. A light, sweet aroma is not identifiable but definitely there. Some spicy woody notes are there as well.

Up front the flavor is fairly sweet. The flavor does impart a nice tartness, although the cranberries do not contribute a very robust flavor. It tastes almost like cherries or green apples as well. There is a light spicy oak flavor and a little vanilla toward the end, and the finish is a slightly sour general fruitiness.

The carbonation is crisp, almost fizzy, and cuts through the flavor of each sip to keep the tongue fresh. Accompanying the sweetness up front is a tart juiciness that turns lightly dry by the end. A buttery oakiness in noticeable in the middle. The body is on the light side of medium.

This is sweeter than I would have expected, especially since cranberries are tart to begin with. I found it easy to drink and could easily have a few more bottles.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"
522,"2012-02-27",4.6,"I cant remember if I have had this one before so figured I would review a bottle from last year. Poured a clearish orange color, with no lacing or head. Aroma is a mix of rasp tart and belgian red, with more woody flavors, and extra sourness from the cranberry. There was also some subtle vanilla spice in the nose. Taste is a perfectly balanced sour lambic with one of the softest mouths you can encounter. Excellent beer from the Legends of fruit based brews.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
522,"2012-02-03",4.2,"Cranic pours a mixture of light red and amber.  Really a beautiful color that you can see in the pic.  A small head forms but quickly fizzes away like a champagne.  First thing I noticed in the smell is a light fresh dose of Cranberries.  Mixed in their is a small amount of acidity and tartness that makes your nose sting just a tad.  In the end is a hint of malt and oak.  Its just a very light smelling beer.  Heck if you can even call it a beer.  To me its more like a mixture of a beer and wine.

The taste came in three parts for me.  The first part was definitely tart and slightly funky on the palette.  As the ale hits the middle of your mouth it starts getting richer.  The cranberries start to really come in.  Mix that in with the oak and its a nice rich deep taste.  Then in the end the tartness comes back a tad mixed in with some bitterness.  Just a beautiful beer.  Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with the perfect amount of carbonation.  Just a joy to drink.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","drunkenpolack"

The carbonation reminds me of partially fermented fruit juice when you leave a bottle of cider in the fridge for too long.  But really its a good thing.  Tart cherry /cranberry flavors - theres a light sweetness thats underneath.  But the spritzy tartness keeps this bright with richer cherry flavors in the finish. I dont particularly get all cranberry more of an assortment mostly cherry and a little apple.  Its tasting really well right now.

Pours a dark rosé color with golden orange hues and a one finger, frothy white head that quickly settles into a lasting ring. Sporadic streaks of lacing left behind. 

Earthy, slightly funky aroma with a strong barrel presence and prominent fruit presence. Lots of earthy oak in the nose with musty funk and a ton of cranberry. The dry, tart character of the cranberry is complimented really nicely by the toasted oak and funky bugs. Like other NG fruit beers, the fruit is very prominent in the nose but it doesnt overpower the other characteristics. 

Medium bodied with a slight creamy texture as well as a bone dry, tart mouthfeel. Dry and funky with lots of tart cranberry sweetness thats puckering without being harsh or acidic. Theres also a strong oak presence that compliments the dryness of the fruit and the musty funk. The fruit character dominates giving the beer more of a dry sweetness than acetic sourness. There is some lingering vinegar-y sourness in the finish but it never becomes overly harsh or unpleasant. 

Overall this was an interesting experiment that paid off. The cranberries worked really well in this hybrid fruit/sour beer because of their natural tart and dry flavor. If you enjoy cranberries than you will probably love this beer. If not, I suggest that you skip trying this beer altogether.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

522,"2011-09-19",4.0,"Purchased at Breeze Thru Liquors in Milwaukee, WI; enjoyed on one of the last meteorological nights of the summer after making replacement keys for my lady, only to find the lost keys within 2 minutes of getting home.  Appearance is like carbonated juice, ruby red with light brown hues, slightly cloudy, no head at all, tiny carbonation bubbles rising to the top.  Aroma of vinegar, sour, cranberries, slight oak, some previous reviews state it smells like horseblanket, and I have no idea what that is so I Googled it, and Im not sure if its a real word.  Is that some descriptor that fancy beer raters just came up with to sound smarter, or is it an actual thing?  Anyways, I think it smells rather nice.  Taste is definitely sour, the sourness doesnt dominate but it does linger, along with a nice cranberry juice flavor that adds a very subtle bitterness to it and a touch of sweetness.  Light to medium body, medium to high carbonation.  Soda like quality to it but you can tell its still beer.  Tastes like the blanket of 10,000 horses.

Oak, oak and oak. I get a slight fruit in the nose, but it is overpowered quickly with oak. I opened this and thought I felled a tree.
Oak up front. A little piney, which is weird. Slight tart green apple. I dont really get the cranberry taste. Just the sensation of tartness. I was really hoping for a bit of cranberry to overpower the oak, but didnt happen. Almost tastes like a bourbon. But not as strong. And it isnt all that bad, unexpectedly.
Tartness stays in the mouth, both from the fruit and the oak. The oak stays longer, making it seem as if you took a bite out of a barrel. Low carbonation makes it seem like it has more mouth-feel than is really there.
A little hard to drink a whole 12oz. bottle, but it is surprisingly good. And has grown on me over the course of the bottle. I still would only drink one every now and then, but wouldnt push it away if offered it. I just wont be seeking it out to buy, or trade. Overall a decent unique beer.

Pours into my Champagne flute with a papaya mango glisten and a small soft white head.

Smell is pretty funky. I smell hits of cranberry, wax, oak, and sourness.

Taste is pretty funky too. Very large farmhouse style presence. Not too tart or sour, pretty sweet actually. Very oaky, which is rigid against the cranberry taste, it doesnt work for me. The is a ripe fruit sweetness about this that irks me to, maybe a bit too wine like.

Overall it isnt what I enjoy in this style, their other fruit beers are certainly better. It isnt tart enough for a cranberry beer and just seems overly funky despite being very fresh. On the other hand it is very light and easy to suck down. NG: Go back to Eisbock.

My first quaff is a generous mouthful and if I close my eyes, I can very easily taste the fresh homemade cranberry pie, crust still warm, as it enters my mouth and makes sweet love to my tastebuds.

522,"2010-08-20",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Bubblegum phenols and cranberry juice aplenty move into pleasant sourness, as mineral qualities peer through once in a while.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the clear amber.
-The nose is rather powerful, reminiscent of cake icing and fruit candy.
-Mild wheat biscuits are found underneath.
-The overtly juicy character makes this quenching.

In long: Intense nose blending maraschino cherries, fresh berries and a spiciness reminding me of those they use in Halloween pumpkin beers.  Taste is very fruity and very juicy.  I noted a bunch of red juicy fruits (cherries, raspberries, wild berries, strawberries, litchis, cranberries) as well as a lot of kiwis and some vanilla.  The beer is a bit sweet with a sweetness that feels like white-sugar.  Strong nutmeg and cinnamon spiciness.  Finish is very tart and sharp and that totally washes the sweetness and spiciness away.  Medium acidity from start to finish.  Carbonation is very active, almost aggressive.  This is an intense beer, almost a sipper.  It is also a very original one, I cannot really think of another beer even remotely similar to this one.  Kick-ass stuff.  God, I love to drink beer.  And no, I dont have a problem with alcohol.

522,"2010-06-15",3.3,"A solid pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a two-finger thick, pale tan colored head.  The beer is a brilliantly clear, red color with gold around the edges.  As I pour this notes of tart cranberry aromatics are noticeable; a more focused inspection of the nose yields a more concentrated version of the same, but also noticeable is a musty, spicy, woody oak notes as well as some buttery oak character, toasted wood notes and even some vanillin aromatics.  Of the base beer not much of anything is noticeable, but the oak does a good job of balancing the cranberry notes; at least in the nose.

This is sweet tasting, though not as aggressively as the Wisconsin Belgian Red.  The cranberries contribute a tartness as well as a general fruitiness, but arent actually all that noticeable as a characteristic cranberry flavor; actually now that I think about it the fruitiness in the nose is pretty non-descript as well.  Some acetic-like acidity adds a piquancy to this beer, which helps to mitigate the sweetness just a bit.  The oak is a bit more subtle than it was in the nose, but is definitely a big part of the flavor profile; a subtle spicy oak character, some raw woody notes, and some buttery oak flavors are joined by a hint of vanillin.  There is a certain tannic astringency to this beer that makes me think of cranberries, but is more likely contributed by the oak character.  The flavors remind me of apple juice, or perhaps cran-apple juice.  The residual sugars contribute to a medium fullness to the body.

Not a bad beer, I like that it is not too aggressively sweet tasting, but it certainly doesnt have a characteristic flavor or aroma of cranberries; if I hadnt already known about the cranberries I likely would have guessed that another fruit, or even none at all was used in this beer.  This was about what I expected, but man what I wouldnt give for New Glarus to produce a traditional, funky, fruited sour beer.  The heavy filtering that this beer has seen definitely has had an effect on the flavor of this beer.  This isnt remotely close to a traditional Lambic though does compare well if compared with the Lindemans of the world.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

522,"2010-04-11",4.0,"Received via a trade, drank in a New Glarus Flute Glass (also via this trade).  The aroma is sweet on the nose with hints of cranberry, lemon, and a slight floral hint.  The beers is orangy amber in appearance with little to no head, but leave a slight resin on the side of the glass as it is consumed. Taste is a little sour, with a strong cranberry taste. It is a little bubbly on the palate very lively and a little bitter.  Overall this is exactly what I expected, a good one off by a great brewery.","North Carolina, USA","DankBrews"
522,"2010-04-09",3.8,"Pours deep clear red with white head, aroma is nice cranberry, vanilla, oak and some funk.

522,"2010-04-08",3.8,"Bottle from Matt (madvike). Translucent pinkish-orange body, thin off-white head. Tart nose with cranberry, sugar, vinaigrette, and sour funk. The body reminds me a lot of the Raspberry Tart and Belgian Red, tart yet not quite puckering, mildly sweet with a firm, biting grassy bitterness in the finish and the tannic, fleeting nature of delicious ripe cranberries. Dry oaky notes complement the fruit and funk. Very good; this would have been suited for the larger bottle treatment its cherry and raspberry East Egg cousins receive.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
522,"2010-04-06",3.8,"Pours to a bright orange brassy body with a quickly dissipating fizzy white head.  Rapid carbonation is visible from many feet away.  The aroma is sour and full of cranberry with sour mash and a light hay.  The flavor is tart and tangy with cranberry, slightly sweet on the finish, some sweet oat.  Id say that if General Mills made a Cranberry Cheerios, that this is what it would taste like.  Perhaps not the sharp sourness up front, but that hearty grain packed cranberry mixture on the finish.  The palate is very sour up front but has a sweeter lingering back end.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
522,"2010-04-02",3.4,"Bottle thanks to pantanap. Bright red and clear. Nose is lambic-ky and tart. Taste starts off sweet and the sour and bitterness kicks in.

522,"2010-04-01",3.8,"Thanks to Exiled for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a clear, light amber color with a white head. The aroma is strong cranberry which not much else coming through. The flavor is a little more complex, but still heavy on the fruit. The beginning is sweet cranberrys and that is followed with some tart cranberry and oak characters. The beer is slightly puckering but is not as sour as some other beers. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice American lambic that really showcases cranberries while not tasting like a wine cooler or some of the lower rated fruit lambics that you see on the shelves.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
522,"2010-03-29",3.8,"12 oz. bottle from the brewery.  Pours a clear reddish amber color with a tiny beige head that leaves little trace.  Aroma of berries and other fruits- cranberry, cherry, grape, apple- and vanilla, with notes of minerals, butter, and wood.  Flavor of tart, juicy cranberries, cherries, apples, grapes, acidic notes, wild yeast, vanilla, and metallic and mineral notes.  Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a juicy mouthfeel.  A really cool, unusual fruit beer.  New Glarus seems to be the best at these.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

Also grass, candi sugar, and acid.  Flavor does have the round fruitiness of Enigma - that sort of tart red juiciness - but ultimately this ends with much more peel and less pulp than that beer does, which makes sense given the fruit choice.  The tartness is mostly subsumed, but outlasts the fruit by a hair.  Light pickle also in the finish.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"

Sweet and sour define the flavor, but with depth and balance that is unbelievable. The inherent tartness of the fruit provides most of the sourness which gives it a very pleasant and natural feel.

522,"2010-03-02",3.9,"12oz. bottle.  A crystal clear, dark pinkish-crimson colored body is crowned with a tall, decently retained head of ivory-beige froth.  After slowly settling to a thin film with a pronounced, bubbly edge, the head leaves skinny, diagonal flares and random spots of lacing behind.  The aroma features ultra-juicy, sweet-tart red berry notes, including the full lineup from cranberries and strawberries to rich cherry.  Vanilla is prominent, just like it is in Belgian Red.  Somehow, it refrains from seeming medicinal, a flaw that probably 90% of fruit beers are prone to.  The flavor follows suit, exploding with juicy cherry-berry notes, showing mostly sweet but with a slightly wild, tart yeast-twang on the back end.  Vanilla is the other major component, though its more of the sweet bean variety than the woody oak type.  On the palate, the body gets some welcomed heft from the residual sugar, while fine, lively carbonation distributes the fruity tartness evenly.  This is most certainly nothing like a true lambic, but throwing stylistic guidelines out the window, its a damn delicious beer.  Cran-bic is further proof that Daniel Carey it the master of the non-lambic fruit beer, amongst other styles.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Rich, sweet cranberry flavor, some grass and lactic sourness providing and odd combination. Stinging carbonation accompanies the thin body and short cranberry and fruit-skin finish. Its nice, but this isnt Raspberry Tart, and the sweetness here sticks in the finish, making even the thin body seem syrupy.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

S: The smell is interesting. There is a mild tartness, cranberry, and also a sweet aroma. A slight bit of spice is also in the background.

T: This one is really full of cranberry, as you might expect. There is a mild tartness, but definitely not up to par with what you might think of when you hear a bear labeled as a *-bic. The sweetness is mild at first, but becomes more pronounced throughout the drinking experience.

M: There is a very nice, crisp feeling on the tongue, with plentiful carbonation.

D: The beer is fairly drinkable, but becomes just too sweet as you get through the glass.

Another interesting beer from New Glarus, but a bit more of a sugary beer than I was expecting. Its definitely not a lambic, but its still significantly better than Sam Adams offering.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

Tons of juicy cranberry, almost syrupy, with some dry wood and light lacto tartness.  Not overly complex or super funky but it smells like there could be some sour in there.  A bit of tart metallic up front that quickly moves into lots of flavorful cranberry fruitiness that is almost equally sweet as it is tart.  The oak isnt very prevalent, but I suppose it dose add some dryness, a touch of chalk as well a hint of earthiness.  Another solid fruit beer from one of the best.

Flavor is oaky vanilla, some cherry, more cranberry although light and fermented out quite a bit- some farmhouse funk, strange off- acids, barnyard light plastic, earth, cherry pits, tannic and more oak.  Not too bad, but not as great as I had hoped.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

Flavor starts a little sweet, wine-coolerish, then the tart comes around rapidly after that and stomps out most of the sweetness. Creaminess comes again in the middle and finishes it out. Cranberry and strawberry flavors are apparent the whole time. The flavor is pretty cloying even though it is subdued by the tart and other flavors - it is right below the surface the whole time, loads of sugar seemingly. Light mouthfeel, lower-medium carbonation. Enjoyable. I couldnt have more than one but I still dig the one Im having. Overall, good to very good.","California, USA","Gypsy19"

522,"2010-01-19",3.7,"12oz bottle, courtesy of MatSciGuy. Thanks, Levi! Pours a deep, medium pinkish-orange / ruby color; beautiful tint on this; thin off-white head with light retention and patchy, fine-bubbled lacing. Pleasant show of oily red fruits, very light tannins and grape skins, similar levels of diacetyl and softly toasted oak in the aroma; everything buttressed by a sparkling red berry character; similar to the Enigma, the light butter and vanilla-tinged oak (minimal overt wood) give this a touch of an overripe character; this is still quite lovely in the nose: great fruit, hints of cinnamon or clove as well. Medium mouthfeel: medium amounts of acidity, slightly oily character, and relaxed carbonation on this; somewhat slick feeling in the mouth; lots of red fruits (cherries, strawberries, cranberries) showing up here, with certainly a berry character overall, but it doesnt come across with quite the same sharp acidity or tannins of other cranberries beers that come to mind (there arent many); lively amounts of tartness, lightly soured and a very pleasant and clear show of the fruit in this; again, more mixed red fruits than cranberries alone, and theres a touch of purposeful diacetyl alongside toasted wood and light vanilla and grape skins; this has a lot of the same character as Enigma originally did in terms of the barrel notes and the slick feel in the mouth: similarly pleasant, but mixed with a melange of red fruits and hints of red wine character (from the tannins, of course, but even more than that); not my favorite New Glarus Unplugged, but definitely refreshing and showing an excellent fruit character. Lasting finish of oakiness and cinnamon and red berries; nice toastiness appears at the far end; balanced ending.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

Good amount of fruitiness that seems more like cherries and apple juice, and a little chocolate and leathery funk.  Faint spices (cinnamon), moderate oak influence noted.  Flavor has more sourness and the fruit does change somewhat though blindly, I dont think I could claim cranberry.  Fairly sweet, like all of NGs fruit beers.

522,"2010-01-03",4.1,"Thanks Santa!  Pours looking like cherry 7-up with only a wisp of a slightly pink head.  A bunch of oakis the first thing I notice in the nose: rich round caramels, vanilla, honey.  While I wouldnt necessarily know the fruit here was cranberry it still smells damn good.  To me it seems more like a combination between cherries & strawberries.  There is a bit of tartness, but less than I expected - it is along the level of tartness that is found in their Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart.  When it hits my tongue I get more of that big oakey hit which quickly gives way to a slightly tart cherry, strawberry and red grape rush.  The tartness is a bit more pronounced here, and definitely recognizable as being sourced from cranberries.  The oak, tartness and sweeter fruit notes all mingle perfectly, creating a beverage that is as hard to pin down as NGs other fruit beers.  That of tannic zing that cranberries have comes out a bit in the finish, along with continuing fruit juice notes.  This is amazing stuff, and certainly in the same league as the Belgian Red & Raspberry Tart.  Carbonation is light but that works wonderfully here, leaving a really nice fruity finish.","Buffalo, New York, USA","rudolf"

Pours a bubbly very clear and surprisingly pale deep rose, moving from ochre at the fringes to florid in the center. A thin white rim. Flavor is somehow less satisfying than the aroma let on. Still good, but not as dense as I expected. Gentle cereal-sweetness, a splash of cranberry sauce, and some lambic bottle dregs. This has a very pillowy fruit character that immediately reminds me of Belgian Red. In reality, this beer really is like a blend of Belgian Red, Enigma, and the Berliner Weisse. The house character is strong. The dimensions are all nice, but a little shallow. It must be really light on the alcohol, because it tastes much like sparkling raspberry-apple cider.

Thanks to Jason for sending me two four packs of this.  It will be tough not to drink them in quick succession since this tastes like a fabulous blend of Enigma, Raspberry Tart, and cranberry relish.  This might just go down as the best Unplugged entry to date.  Clearly the Careys have not lost their touch; I cannot wait to see what comes out of the new building in 2010.

Aroma / Appearance - Looking like carbonated cranberry juice the short lived dirty white head glimmers in the daylight.  Sour and tart like Enigma with a few months on it this has a background of cranberry.  Sweetness accents the sour aspect which is a bit like either Belgian Red or Raspberry Tart in nature.

Flavor / Palate - Fruity brown cedar snaps the palate awake.  Sour like a Flemish brown it brings to memory previous entries such as Sour Brown and Enigma in the way it fills the mouth with a wonderful woody texture.  Thick but not cloying it is nice to sit on this one for a while just savoring the experience.  This is the perfect Thanksgiving / Christmas seasonal.  Stock up while you can; this one should be good for a couple of years to come.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Taste is the sweet, semi tart fruit of the cranberry up front, followed by the oak and vanilla notes from the nose. The fruit is the main story, and it is very natural and clean.  The palate is medium, with a fair amount of spritzy carbonation. The finish is long with the cranberry fruit and then the vanilla oak.

Lots of cranberry in the flavor, but actually less tart than cranberry juice, though not as sweet either.

522,"2009-11-28",4.2,"Pours a rich rose color with thin light pink head.  Aroma is of sour yeast, ripe fruit, cranberry, oak and vanilla.  Taste is tart fruit up front which gives way to a sweet fruit, tangy cranberries, and if left to warm, you get a nice oak flavor which leaves the tongue with a nice flavor of vanilla.  Carbonation is well appointed (moderate) and the sourness of the yeast and the tang of the cranberry are very well balanced.  Another fine fruit beer from Dan Carey.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Juelze"

Aroma:  Raspberry, cranberry and ever so slight funk.

Taste: Cranberry, raspberry, brown sugar, lemon and some industrial yeast notes.

There is a stream of tiny bubbles continuously rising to the surface.  This beer really looks beautiful in the glass.  Very pleasant aroma of cranberry along with some mild oak and just a bit of funk.  The flavor is both tart and sweet with cranberry, a bit of lemon, mild oak and just a bit of funk. Bright and lively on the palate.  Simply put, this beer is a delight.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
522,"2009-11-26",3.8,"(bottle) Pours light brownish-red with a white head and good lacing.  Aroma is slightly musty, but when swirled more of the tart and sweet cranberry is displayed.  A little bit of oak and vanilla is present as well, but not too complex on the nose.  Taste is very good, with a nice balance between sweet and tart, a lot of cranberry flavor and lemon zest, which yields to a subtle oak and earthy undertone on the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is lively.  Not terribly complex, but its very drinkable and tasty nonetheless.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

522,"2009-11-23",3.9,"aroma is stench of tart cranberries and gigantic wood. appearance is wonderfully translucent light red bordering on regular old amber.  flavor is a blast of wood and cranberry simultaneously, so that no pure ocean spray style juice flavor ever shows its face alone. hit of sourness and funk appears in the aftertaste, subtle and fleeting. wood muck lingers for a good while must to my enjoyment.  no cloying fruit sweetness, no overwhelming fruit character or fruit juice type of approach. big big wood and just a classy hit of sourness.","River Grove, Illinois, USA","satan165"
522,"2009-11-22",3.9,"12 oz bottle from Roys Market (New Glarus, WI). Pours a bit of a reddish gold, tinged with the brighter berry touch, really quitw taken by the hue, very faint haze, well carbonated, decent white head that dies to a small film, clings to the edges. Aromas are some nice wet wood, tart cranberries, dry oak, a touch of champagne and light malty sweetness. A touch of vanilla, faint spice, the cranberry comes in a bit, tart yet mildly sweet. Initial is a wonderful balance of cranberry and lighter grainy sweetness, a touch of honey and vanilla, almost yogurt with a nice light sourness, subtle and smooth, moving into an enjoyable tartness that sticks to the palate, good carbonation on the palate, sourness grows a bit as I get further in, but it certainly is balanced with good sweetness, as cranberry really makes the nature of this beer, tart and sweet in harmony. Dry, a touch prickly. I liked this, but interested to see what kind of dying out of the fruit and dryness this beer might get with age. Very nice, a subtle sour fruit beer, more delicate but layered flavors.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
522,"2009-11-22",3.9,"Wonderful fruity tartness and sourness in aroma,sure could be cranberry, my mouth waters just smelling it as my jowls anticipate the sourness. Taste,wow that sure is sweet, not as tart or sour as the aroma leads you to believe it would be. plenty of sucker like cherry/cranberry sweetness. Some oak shows up in the aftertaste,medium body a little to much emphasis on the sweetness,could use a little more sourness in flavor to be more like a true lambic. Mostly a desert or summer sipper","Muskego, Wisconsin, USA","brewblackhole"

Very light and easy drinking, which is very true to style I suppose.  A little light in the ABV department and very sweet, a slightly better version of all the cheaper Belgian fruit Lambics, albeit with that rugged test tube sourness.  The sour aftertaste really sticks with you.

522,"2009-11-18",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 7, 2011 [rated 11.18.09]  12oz bottle.  Pours a clear glowing... well... cranberry juice color with a nice thick frothy white foam.  Aroma is strong lactic, yogurt, saw dust, some cranberry, but overall thats a hard aroma to place, mostly lightly tart yogurt, similar to some of Uplands lambics in aroma.  Flavor at first is sharp and very tart crisp cranberry, very bright, immediately followed by smooth yogurt and cedar, finishing like cranberry yogurt, very nice, quick finish with a tart and quite sour aftertaste, leaves nice sourness on the gums.  Medium bodied with very sharp and crisp sizzling carbonation.  7.5.8.4.16.  . . . . . . . . . . . . [bottle 6.8.10]  Pours a cranberry color that seems to have faded slightly to now include orange brown notes, still with thick frothy white head.  Aroma is more of saw dust, very woody.  Flavor is still quite sweet of cranberries but seems to have gotten a bit more tart, cedar, light yogurt, great cranberry flavor, finishes candy like.   I cant tell if I like it more or less now, but I suppose Ill rate it more conservatively this time out.  8.4.7.4.15 ......

Aroma abounds with fresh tart cranberries and buttery, woody oak along with some light horseblanket funk.  Starts with a soft pale malty sweetness with good fruit balance and lots of tart oaky flavor before a slightly puckering drier finish.  Reminds me a light of their Unplugged Enigma with a lighter fruit character.  Good complexity throughout and should age very well.  A great beer and a steal for the price.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

522,"2009-11-10",4.3,"Wow.  Mellow, dreamy but still biting and punchy.  As lambics go, the cranberry factor is BRILLIANT.  Tart, potently yeasty, it smacks around the palate.  Not only that, but the color is incredible.  You just have to keep staring at this beer (pick a nice glass) because it fits so amazingly the autumn-rich / fruit-potency of the flavor.  So very unique - - a mind-blowingl conflagration of style, care, skill, and ingredient.","USA","alassio"

This fades quickly to be replaced by a sweet, creamy wild yeast funk. Initially tart flavor, fruity, but anything distinctly of cranberry is very subdued.

Theres actually some cherry smell in there too. Not sure what thats about. Theres a bit of tart, but mostly its sweet. Taste is more tart, with a little sourness on the finish. Itll be interesting to see if this dries out over time, because its pretty sweet now. Its a bit syrupy, but the velvety carbonation makes for a nice mouthfeel.
