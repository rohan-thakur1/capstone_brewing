4603,"2017-01-19",4.0,"Bottle at Bens over christmas. What a drink! Garvie just kind of grabbed it and started opening it. I though he was joking until it was clear that he wasnt. A totally wonderful cider with a pure undistilled apple flavour. So delicious and festive on a cold evening. Cheers Ben.","CZECH REPUBLIC","TheCametron"

4603,"2015-12-08",3.2,"En fût à la brasserie. La bière est bien blanche et affiche une mousse peu tenace qui se réduit rapidement à un mince anneau blanc sur le liquide dénudé. La première neige est toujours fondante il fait croire. Nez de fortes épices de Noël; de la cannelle, du clou de girofle à profusion, la noix de muscade. Liquide mince en bouche qui me semble même aqueux. Heureusement que le pétillement est au rendez-vous... La banane encore et encore,impossible de passer à côté. Le reste est houblon et jeune céréale blinde et poudreuse. Tiens, une finale légèrement citronnée me surprend et me plaît bien.  ---Rated via Beer Buddy for Android","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
4603,"2014-07-19",3.3,"Bottle @ tasting. Aroma is malty apples with caramel, toffee and more apple. Flavour is huge sugary apple caramel alcohol tangy fruity zesty madness. Wow. Not sure if I like this, but definitely special.","Den Haag, NETHERLANDS","dEnk"
4603,"2013-04-18",3.6,"On tap at Dieu du ciel. The color is a hazy gold with a thick beige head.The aroma is of herbs and fruits.The taste also of herbs like anis,nutmeg and others as for fruits it was mostly bananas.The finish in the mouth was bitter but not to much.","Ste-Therese, Quebec, CANADA","LadySusan"
4603,"2013-01-13",3.6,"Un verre à Montréal.  5.3%.  Une robe jaunâtre et opaque.  Un col mousseux modérément généreux.  Une dentelle.  Un nez bien occupé par les épices.  Un doux parfum de blé acidulé.  Une banane écrasée, des herbes et du citron. Une fois bien tempéré, lanis se dévoile davantage que la muscade.  Des saveurs a priori fortes en muscade et pratiquement mentholées par la présence de lanis.  Des houblons qui surprennent et toujours cette banane qui traverse le chemin de mes papilles.  Un blé accompagnateur et mordant.  En bouche, un corps construit selon les normes de la maison.  Une finale totalement dominée par les épices et par une amertume marquée par des houblons herbeux.  Pas un fou de la muscade mais, dans ce cas-ci, cela fonctionne très bien.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
4603,"2011-01-09",3.7,"Dégustée en fût sur place. De couleur dorée-jaune et opaque. Nez de levures fruitées (agrumes, abricots, notes de bananes et de pêches), dépices (moyen de clou de girofle, notes de  cannelle, traces de muscade), moyen de blé avec des notes de sucre bonbon et des traces de gommes balloune. Moyennement ronde en bouche avec un pétillement moyen et une texture un peu crémeuse. Goût de levures épicées (moyen de clou de girofle, notes de gingembre et de cannelle, traces de muscade) et fruitées (abricots sucrés, moyen dagrumes, traces de bananes) lors de lentrée en bouche  auquel se rajoute un goût de blé légèrement asséchant avec des notes de sucre bonbon et des traces de pain puis en finale lon retrouve une légère amertume de levures avec des notes herbeuses. Post-goût moyen et aux notes sèches, composé de notes amères de levures fruitées (zest dagrumes) et épicées avec quelques traces dalcool. (automne 2006)","Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Viper666"
4603,"2010-02-01",3.0,"Aroma as mentioned has anise, some bitters and gin, (didnt get nutmeg) hazy yellow, tiny white head, lace. Flavour of wheat is overwhelmed by anise and nutmeg mix, seems like lemon gin, a bit unusual, for my taste, but I applaud the novelty here. Another unique offering.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DougShoemaker"
4603,"2009-01-08",3.4,"Tap at the Brewpub: Pours cloudy light yellow with minimal white head. Zesty wheat dominates the nose, with a touch of old lemon peel and dusty phenols. Crispy feel with a perfumy/citric flavor. Touch of lemon peel here as well, with a anisette suggestion and a white pepper presence as well. Pretty good, not great.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"
4603,"2006-12-16",3.9,"Lightly hazy golden yellow body with a creamy white head (3+). Moderate licorice and anise notes in the aroma, tough to tease apart spices. Stronger anise in the flavour, with a milder nutmeg partners, and light bitterness in the finish lingers in to the aftertaste along with the anise.  (8+) Average palate is pleasantly effervescent. I very much liked this one, but I dont know that I could consume more than a glass or two in a sitting.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
4603,"2006-11-27",3.3,"Bu sur place en fut (10 oz). Jaune blanche très pale et peu brumeuse, mince collet. Arome légé de blé et de muscade. Petit goût de muscade, un peu de blé, pas si épicé mais amère.","Boisbriand, Quebec, CANADA","Quevillon"
4603,"2006-11-23",3.7,"Hazy yellow honey hue, with a small white head, wheaten bananaish nose, with a nice anise spicy accent, completed by a faint absinth liquorish note, with a citrus fruitiness follows through on a medium-bodied palate with a zesty wheaty, spicy character, of anise, nutmeg, with a gingerbread and a subtle liquorice note, a mild milkiness mouthfeeling, with a citrus fruits tones, leading towards a wheaten spiciness finish.","montréal, Quebec, CANADA","rederic"
4603,"2006-11-21",3.8,"Very cloudy yellow body with a small white head.  Aroma of spicy banana, very herbal with anis other herbaceous plants.  Body is rather full for a witbier, full of bready malts, cereals and wheat.  Very yeasty too, really felt alive with banana, lemon and peach flavours.  The spices that I got in the nose also appear in the taste but are not as dominant.  This is a superior witbier that breaks the boundaries of the style.  Seems to brewed only once a year during the early days of winter hence its name First Snow (Première Neige).  Important Warning: in Montreal saying out loud that you are looking forward for the First Snow may generate violent reactions from the locals.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4603,"2005-12-25",3.5,"Hazy golden ale with a creamy lacing whit head. Herbal aroma, with anis and light banana notes. In mouth creamy bananas with cloves, very smoth and silky, classy wit. Enjoyed with M_Heine and GonzoBeer, on Dec. 17th, 2005 (YeHaa).","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
4603,"2005-12-20",3.2,"draught. hazy white-golden coloured body with a medium creamy white head. the aroma leads me to believe that I like the combination though Im not usually too fond of anise. there is typical orange zest, dusty yeast, and mild licorice lingering in the back. Then I taste it and have my original qualms about the spice. the body is light and doughy with the aforementioned anise playing a large role. its also somewhat spritzy and efferevescent with a mildly astringent peppery texture. I think overall its lacking character and could possibly be more...I suppose I should try this again on a warm summer day though I cant imagine that anise has any thirst quenching properties.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"
4603,"2005-12-18",3.6,"Robe blonde légèrement voilée surmontée dune mousse blanche qui sestompe. Arômes de banane, de citron, de curaçao et dépices. Saveurs de blé, de levure et de citron.","Saint-Ours, Quebec, CANADA","Miguel"
4603,"2005-03-11",3.2,"Hazy warm yellow color with creamy snow white head. Mild aromas of black fruit with fine touches of soft spices, coriander; dry bread, wheat, and hints of neutral fresh made risoto. Taste is also soft and smooth with accents of herbs, wheat, dry toasts with fresh butter, faint touch of lemon skin ending in a light bitter refreshing body. Thanks Daniel for sending this one over.","St Idesbald, BELGIUM","lachesis"
4603,"2005-01-04",3.8,"Pale cloudy yellow to gold. Appealing lemon and spices aroma filling your mind with dreams of a shining sun in the darkest night. Forming a pleasant mix between the german weizen and belgian spiced wit in its very wheaty almost banana-like flavor profile married with crisp tiny bubbles texture while being enhanced by desserty nutmeg, anise, lemongrass and almost vanilla reminiscent tones. Deeply pleasant, almost as good as the blanche neige.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
4603,"2005-01-04",3.4,"Hazy blonde color, thin creamy white head. Aroma of citrus, nutmeg, anise and wheat. Flavor of citrus, nutmeg, anise and wheat with a sweet finish. Light to medium body, slightly oily texture, soft carbonation.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
4603,"2004-12-29",3.5,"The beer starts with an Anise assault which proves refreshing and entertaining. I am not a real fan of white beers when its -40 degrees outside. However, this is a good winter white ale because of the spice blends. They prove warming and effective despite the beers refreshing characteristics.","Quebec, CANADA","PrimeMinister"
4603,"2004-12-29",3.2,"Pale gold cloudy body with thin and lasting creamy head that leaves a good lacing. Very pleasant amise aroma with flowery and citrusy hints. Taste is refreshing. Has a good sweet attack with spicy notes, but then it gets thinner and leaves a short and timid bitter aftertaste. Good stuff, but I was expecting a bit more.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"
4603,"2004-02-25",3.4,"Hazy pale yellow.  Aroma of huge amounts of spice, pepper, lots of lemon.  Flavour was spicy, citrusy, quite sweet with some bananas.  Finish is very dry, mild bitterness.","Peterborough, Ontario, CANADA","radiomgb"
4603,"2004-02-21",4.1,"Big sweet banana aroma. Cloudy white body with thick, pillowy white head that lasts and lasts. Mild spiciness on a sweet refreshing beer. Just a bit over-carbonated but nice creamy mouthfeel. On tap.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
4603,"2004-02-16",3.5,"Beautiful nose, pungent and sweet, bananas & a hint of pie spicing.  Odd bits of spice stick to the tongue, swirls of floatiness, just a touch thin, but very good overall.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
4603,"2002-12-16",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 19, 2006 Nouveau witbier...Palpable banana fragrance and imbedded wheat...A spicy and plump yeasty sieve yields an emancipating star anise and supporting nutmeg...A surrealist interpretation which remains a belgian wit at its core, but offers creative spiciness which takes the style to further realms...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
4603,"2002-12-16",4.4,"Pale hazy yellow.  In the aroma I got a nice fresh lemon, coriander, a touch of anise and a peppery note.  This beer goes on forever.  You taste coriander, fresh bread and lemon at first, then comes an anise burst and when you think the beer is gonna fall, you get a nice drizzle of nutmeg.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","SimonPatrice"
4603,"2002-12-16",4.0,"A very interesting interpretation of the style.  After the stout (Déesse Nocture), this was my favorite from their offering. Nice refreshing tart wit but spiced differently with nutmeg and anise and pepper taking the brunt of the flavour profile.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","dhurtubise"
