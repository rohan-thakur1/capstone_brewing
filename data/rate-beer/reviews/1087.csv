1087,"2016-09-06",3.8,"Clear bright golden with a very thin white cap. Bright pear and earthy booze funk on the nose. Smooth and delightfully sweet on the palate thats got some pear, sugar, and a light appley backbone. Crisp yet sweet and playful, but a little one dimensional. Not bad by any means, actually quite damn good.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
1087,"2016-08-26",3.2,"[24/12/15] Bottle from Clackamas Town Center: Golden body. Nose is floral, apples. Taste is sweet, pears, fruits. Tart in the finish.","Chevy Chase, Maryland, USA","altonbrownd"
1087,"2016-08-01",2.7,"Light pear aroma, but not overwhelming like many other perries. Not much else picked up, however. Pours almost clear, with no head. Complex taste, but remains balanced. Not too sweet, which is a fatal flaw for many offerings with pear. Very refreshing, crisp, light.","Dallas, Texas, USA","Intricate08"
1087,"2016-07-23",3.3,"Appearance: Pours a very clear, scantly yellow body with some stray white suds.

Smell: Sweetish, lightly tart-scented pear.

Taste: A one-two pear apple flavor, lightly sweet, lightly tart and not really that different from just about any other of these products out there. Lightly crisp close.

Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Its fine. Really, its fine. Nice summertime refreshment albeit nothing altogether special or memorable.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
1087,"2015-09-21",3.4,"Bottle. Pours a clear almost totally clear in fact pour, a bit of fizzy white bubbles. A nice sweet fruity pear nose. Light dry flavors dominate, light sugary sweet clear pear. Very dry, tannins. Solid.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"

1087,"2014-10-27",3.3,"sample from bottle at 2014 houston big brew fest. Pale straw with minimal head. Sweet pear cider. Pretty average for a perry. Could use a bit more flavor.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"

1087,"2014-09-01",3.4,"Draught at Alibi Room, VancouverBlond color. The aroma is quite strong, it gets to the nose while the glass is still on the counter. Fine Perry, off-dry but not weak, appreciated for its light vinous character and mild acidity. I guess its apple and pear though.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
1087,"2014-08-31",3.4,"On tap at the Alibi Room, pours a clear pale yellow with a small white head. Aroma brings out lots of pears, with medium sweetness. Flavour reveals notes of pear (duh), with medium sweetness and a very high drinkability. Very well-balanced and easy drinking. Nice stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

1087,"2014-05-28",2.9,"Hazy yellow. Milder aroma. Not too sweet. Flavor is full and finishes tart. Tartness lingers with a lengthy aftertaste. Comes off overall as a more natural pear cider.","austin, Texas, USA","kidmartinek"
1087,"2013-11-14",3.3,"On tap at August Jack's. Clear, straw yellow. Good, solid pear aroma. More of an overripe pear smell. Taste is pretty good ripened pear, and white wine.","British Columbia, CANADA","XaenDovet"

1087,"2013-02-04",3.1,"Bottle.  Pours a clear golden amber with a bit of a thin white head on the edges.  Lightly vinous pear on the nose, a bit of banana yeast.  Medium bodied, a bit empty overall.  Slightly tart and with a light acidity, but not much going on.  Tasty and drinkable, but not a lot of depth.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

1087,"2013-01-22",3.2,"Bomber from Made in Oregon. Pours clear light gold. Aroma is somewhat tart pear - like skin. Not too thin for perry. It starts a little sweet, moves to ripe pear and ends tart like skin. Decent drink.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1087,"2012-11-15",3.4,"Bomber from Total Wine Virginia Beach. Pours a clear pale yellow color with a hint of head. Aroma of tart pears, vinous, with a sweet finish. The taste is sweet pears, apples and a lightly tart finish. Medium bodied. Decent.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
1087,"2012-09-19",3.5,"Batch 19 bottle from New Beer. Served in a rounded tumbler.

Clear, fizzy, bright, pale wheat body.

Grassy, skin-y, minty, juicy apple scent.

Fleshy, chalky apple flavor. Sweet, but not abusively so. Green pear perfume starts to come up on me. Moderately acidic. Skin. Low carbonation. Some leftover yeast. Not quite, quite considered thin. Subtle minty tartness & alcohol on the finish.

A surprisingly decent 6-pack-style cider made on the cheap from casual supermarket produce.","FT: Stale Polotmavý in Queens, New York, USA","MicroGrog"
1087,"2012-09-16",3.3,"Bottle with Ann. Clear yellow pour with no head. Nice apple and pear aroma. Taste is decidedly more apple than pear. Fizzy aftertaste and has plenty of sweetness.","Ambler, Pennsylvania, USA","DeputyAndy"
1087,"2012-08-18",2.8,"Pear nose, but with signifcant apple character. Crystal clear yellow, some carbonation. Pretty dry, not exceedingly tart apple and pear flavor. Not easily recognizable as a perry as a perry rather than a cider. No off-flavors, but little happening with this semi-dry cider/perry.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
1087,"2012-07-27",3.4,"The pour is a clear golden color with a small white head.  Nose is quite sweet and sugary.  Lots of pear aroma, sugar, and a hint of spice and apple, too.  The flavor is pretty much the same as the aroma.  Its simple and quite sweet.  Lots of pear, a hint of apple, some light tartness in the background, too.  A touch of yeast and maybe a little bit of sulfur.  Just a little too sweet for me.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

1087,"2012-07-10",2.8,"Pretty good pear, great pear aroma, almost the best part. Good pear taste, though not super forward, with sweetness and not too much tartness.","Portland, Oregon, USA","stchloe"
1087,"2012-06-30",3.3,"Pours a clear golden color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of pears and sugar. The flavor is similar with the sweet pear notes really coming through. There is the lightest hint of tartness. Not bad.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
1087,"2012-06-14",3.4,"Bottle (batch 21 from 4/6/2012). Pours with a crystal clear, very pale golden hued body with a quick to fade white head that settles as a small ring. Aromas are dry, sulfur, pear, lightly candied. Very light phenol (coriander or clove), medium acid, light apple notes, musty. Some floral sweetness. Flavors are decently dry (demi-sec), pear and apple qualities. Acid comes a cross a bit tangy; balancing but not dominating. Missing the complexity of the Wandering Aengus line. Very light tannin, low sulfur. Some low sweetness. Tangy acid in a candy/jolly rancher sort of way. Medium to medium high carbonation. Mostly dry on the finish. Playful, low bodied. Somewhat forgettable. This cider can and does routinely make better ciders.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
