The appearance was a hazy burnt red color with a quickly dissipating barely there white cap of a head. Bar pour, rating adjust appropriately.

The taste was sour with touches of sweet, bitter and tart through the previously mentioned flavors. A semi-sour apple aftertaste leads into the finish.

Rustic charm, genre-spanning, very interesting and characterful, but balanced and very drinkable (medium body at most but nooo sign of alcohol and theres an intense zesty freshness that reminds of citrus rind and pith).

2329,"2013-09-05",3.6,"October 2012 bottle (11 months old).
Appearance: The body is amber with a light haze. The head is short and thin with poor retention. This isnt a very appealing beer.
Aroma: The aroma is slightly of red wine vinegar with hints of cherry and a backing of lightly tart lemon and leather, there are also hints of oak tannins and dry red wine. The aroma is mild, but smells nice.
Taste: The intro is of tannins, dry red wine and hints of alcohol, but it is taken over by leathery and dry Brett. Oak is big throughout, but not overbearing and the Brett has really taken hold. The finish is of Brett, alcohol and tannins, hints of cherry, with a light warming sensation lingering.
Palate: Light to medium bodied with high carbonation.
Overall: I remember liking this a lot more, I remember a lot more fruitiness of cherries and a lot more sweetness along with hints of sour. I need to try this fresher, before the Brett has changed this too much. This is still a good beer, just not something I would pay $20 for in this state.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

2329,"2013-01-21",3.4,"A golden ale with moderate carbonation and no head retention.  Soft aroma of fruity bubble gum with 50% more grape sticks!  A soft cidery aroma was noticed by the end of the bottle.  The flavor is clean and boozy with slightly woody red grape notes and a hint of malt.  Smooth.  Mild sweetness. Low bitterness. The brett provides a mild tangy quality, but no barnyard which is fine.  Overall its good, but slightly disappointing given the price tag.  It could be a little more robust in aroma and flavor, but it isnt weak.  It does nice things to my throat and tongue and tastes better as I near the end of the bottle.

The nose is the highlight for this brew ; its a fruity bouquet, coupled with a vinous note, mineral water, caramel malt, and honey. Im very impressed  - The flavor profile impresses initially as well ; the fruitiness from the belgian side as well as the wine barrel treatment does wonders for this brew - there is apricot, pear, and grapeskin present, with a golden belgian strong peeking through with the caramel malty side, bread, and some earthen ware from the barrel treatment. Its crisp, and dry, and perhaps too carbonated for my liking. One nearly forgets that this was conditioned with brett ; I would also prefer more light funk, if their house yeast is capable of imparting that element like some brett infused brews bring to the table, to balance out the fruity sweetness - but overall a fantastic attempt","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

2329,"2012-05-06",3.2,"I like sour beers, mostly because they taste like candy. Ive never encountered one that didnt have some complexity, that is until I tried Allagash Interlude. The description makes it sound like an absolute winner: a Belgian strong pale ale aged in red wine barrels with Brettanomyces yeast for souring. But the net product is a beer that tastes like little more than an extremely dry cider.

I received a 750ml caged and corked bottle from a friend in a trade (thanks, Joseph!). I split it with a friend. We each poured it into tulip glasses.

Appearance: Bright, almost glowing shade of orange. Peach skin or honey hue. Noticeably cloudy but with plenty of visible carbonation. Forms a small, white, soapy head which retains and laces well enough.

Smell: Strong sour yeast esters with hints of a white grape vinous fragrance (which is ironic considering its aged in red wine barrels). 

Taste: Im always looking for a beer to surprise me and Allagash Interlude definitely did with its sour palate. Immediate dry sourness hits the tongue right away, giving way to a tart green apple or white grape flavor and then reverts back to the sharp dry tartness of the beginning. It finishes mostly clean with just a bit of a dryness in the aftertaste. The problem is the palate is simply little more than sheer sourness and not enough fruity qualities or other flavors to balance it out. As it warms I do get a bit of an apple juice or cider flavor, but thats quite subtle as the dry sourness overshadows it for sure. Theres also an acidic taste here, almost in the league of vinegar. All this beer needs is some fruitiness to balance it out as theres really not a lot of taste to really enjoy and absorb.

Drinkability: While Allagash Interlude is a pretty big beer at 9.5% ABV its not the alcohol that makes it a sipper (although there is some noticeable warmth) - its the sourness. A thin, very crisp mouthfeel is an ideal delivery method for this type of palate. But the sheer sharp sourness and dryness had me pulling back on the sip very quickly. The effervescence made it difficult to drink in more than a sip at a time anyway.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

An almost sour-like aroma... not that much oak in the nose, mostly sour like a Belgian-style sour ale with a little grain and sweetness present.  It really gets up in your nostrils... very, very good!  I could whiff this all day long and be happy as a clam.  It has a very yeasty-sour mouth feel.  You can tell theres alot of alcohol here.  An interesting, really unique mouth feel.  What an amazing palate!  The oak barrel is very light, no doubt subsided a little after a couple of years (this is probably a good thing).  Really good, but really heavy.  The yeast hits the stomach pretty hard, so be prepared.  Although strong in the yeast department, I would almost say this is actually a little thin and easy to drink.... which is great, because I love the idea of a Belgian but  I dont like how they can weigh down your stomach at times.

The aroma is complex with lots of fruit (grape, cherry, and perhaps some apple/pear) along with fruisty balsamic, spicy barrel, and quite a bit of Brett.  The flavor has lots of juicy-grapey-wine notes and also lots of barrel and wood flavors.  There are some sharp notes of funk and also flavors of sour bread but this leans more toward tangy than being overly sour.  The finish is semi-dry (perhaps from the wine tannins?) with some lingering bretty funk toward the back of the tongue.  The high ABV is mostly hidden under all the exotic flavors.

2329,"2010-10-25",3.6,"750ml bottle, 2006 vintage consumed in 2010.  The pour gives a cloudy, dark, dusky orange-amber body with a thin, swirly, off-white cap of foam.  A wet, spotted wash mostly rejoins the pool below, failing to form hard lace.  The nose is very earthy, clearly showing the effects of 4+ years of brett influence.  Tart, musty crab apples are joined by dry caramel sugars, cinnamon-sugar dessert bread, and some funky grain.  Farmhouse wood and fading, vinous fruitiness play off of one another, lending depth.  Flavors are a little more muddled, but they run along the same lines.  Sweet-tart apple mash is met with caramelized bread, grain, grapes, and some fig.  Oak isnt prominent, but its there.  Brett has consumed a lot of the sugars, infusing some must and earth in their place, but it still largely remains fruity and sweet.  The palate sports lively, fine carbonation throughout the medium-full body, finishing dusty, scratchy, and somewhat oxidized.  Overall, its a good brew, but its probably a little long in the tooth.  I think this might have been more complex and pulled together a year or two ago.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

2329,"2010-07-11",4.0,"2006 vintage bottle thanks to Footbalm. Pours a clear golden with a medium white head. The aroma is a intense sour and funky barrel note. The flavor is great; initially overwhelming Brett and funk, light sour and lots of vinous qualities, the best aspect is a drop-off massive dryness that literally sucks the liquid off of your palate. Like a fragile and think piece of cotton candy that falls apart. Wonderful.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
2329,"2010-07-11",3.8,"Vintage 2007 bottle. Pour was a very cloudy orange with a thin white head. The nost is quite heavy on the bretamayaces yeast, in short meaning it makes it seem like this would be a sour ale. Taste is quite different. A good bit of fruit-like sweetness is heavy up front with a decent amount of that belgian sourness on the aftertaste. Overall a very decent belgian ale that hides the alcohol. The tartness starts to open up as the beer gets warmer. Overall the sweet and the sour have a nice balance.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","ruskiimperial"
2329,"2010-07-06",4.5,"Appearance: This beer poured a nice golden-ruby reddish color with a huge fluffy off white cloud of head.

Smell: The smell was dominated by a musty funkiness(in a good way) with nice hints of fruit and yeast.

Taste: Despite the strong funkiness of the beer I was still able to detect a vinous quality which I assume was from the Merlot and Sirah barrels. The wine added hints of white grapes while the yeast used added a nice sourness to it. Nice hints of cloves and pepper were also detected.

Mouthfeel: Nice crisp and tart finish with a medium body.

2329,"2010-04-26",4.0,"Have been looking forward to it for awhile. 2008 750 ml bottle poured into my snifter. I also have a vintage 2005...which that review will be combined with this and added eventually.

A-Body is a very cloudy orange/amber. Pours with an approximately 1-2 finger white foamy head which eventually fades to a thick collar. Leaves some traces of lacing behind in the glass. When held up to the light one can see that the body has a dynamic cloudiness.

S- Mild Belgian floral hops hit the nose first. This is followed by a balance of oak and exotic fruit (peach, mango, pineapple, apple...etc). A slight phenolic presence along with a hefty bready yeast linger in the background. Overall impression of the nose is definitely on the sweet side.

T-The initial taste is rather mild an offers a slight presence of a slightly tart exotic fruit flavors(as described above) with a distinctive oak presence along with a slight bready yeast backbone. I would say that the oak is the highlight of the initial flavor. A good dose of floral hops come through for the finish as well as a good bit (but not over the top) of alcohol astringency making the finish rather dry. The initial flavors fade completely for the finish. Nothing lingers but a slight alcohol heat.

M-Low to medium slightly tingly carbonation and light body with a balance of yeast and phenols. Body seems very wet upfront but finishes very dry.

D- This is my first experience with this beer. It is good but not quite what I expected. Its quite dry and the hops seem to have faded though the oak makes itself known. Allagash always does a nice job with their beers and this one is no different.

2329,"2010-02-03",4.3,"750 ml. bottle from Macs on West Peachtree. I am not opposed in any way to pay $20 for a bottle of beer, in the case that it is spectacular. Light brown and dark orange in color. Head fades away rather quickly, but this brew still has a pleasant look to it. Wow, this is a fairly aromatic brew. I am about a foot away from it and my nostrils are filled with its stench. A wonderful touch of a brett and sour funk aroma. I am getting a light red wine and cherry fruit aroma. I might be confusing the cherry fruit, but there is an underlying sweetness in that aroma. The brett stands out most to me. Usually, I dont see Belgian Strong beers with the brett characteristic(s). Maybe with time the oak would come through more, but it is very subdued. Sweet caramel malts coming out more as the beer warms. Wow, a nice balance between the sour and brett. The brett hits my taste buds at first and then a very fruity/sour red wine flavor splashes the tongue, and feels like it coats it rather well. Sweet cherry and fruit flavors are coming through in waves. Flavor is so nuanced; its as if every gulp is different. Oak is not very noticeable, but I wouldnt want anything taking away from the sour and brett flavors.

Funk profile intermingles with a savory juicy ripe fruitiness in ways that simply titillate the senses. Allagash yeast is fully recognizable and welcomed.

Aroma holds tons of nectarine, apricot, strawberry, wine, and definite funk notes from the Brett. Juicy smell is rife with grape, raspberry and pear, and a touch of wood from the aging seems to come through as well. Flavor has two facets that are both phenomenally presented. One is the mixed berry from the aroma, and though sweet it is extremely well balanced and not cloying in any way. The other facet is the Brett; boldly evident both at the start and the finish, it complements the fruit punch aspect of this beer impeccably. Intertwined with both of these major sides of the flavor are notes of Belgian spice, yeast, and clear vinous notes fro the wine barrels. The palate is as intriguing to the tongue as the flavor is, but not overdone in any way; the Brett is strong, but not overpowering.

2329,"2009-10-31",4.1,"Rating #2000, 2006 bottle - Pours slightly hazy orange with a small white head.  Fresh out of the fridge, the aroma is led by very wine like grape notes and a little underlying malt.  As it warms the brett comes out more and more.  The flavor includes dry red wine characteristics mixed with sweet malt and some farmhouse flavors.  As it warms the oak becomes more apparent and, between a warmer temperature and more yeast from pours further down in the bottle, the brett really starts taking over and earthy notes emerge.  Its medium bodied with lively carbonation.  Theres a lot of complexity here and considerable variance with temperature and quantity of yeast in the pour.  Its a very interesting and enjoyable brew.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"

Nuts, caramel, brown bread, and other more pedestrian notes struggle for identity under a big blast of balsamic, berries, and red wine on the mid-palate.

2329,"2008-06-21",4.8,"750ml caged&corked bottle. Pours a deep russet with brilliant orange and auburn highlights and a medium-sized, short-lived, off-white head. The aroma is strong - I caught a smell immediately after opening, before pouring and without even bringing my nose close to the bottle lip. The first thing that jumps out is the sour - not overwhelming or vinegar-like, but pleasant like tart raspberries. There is also a great cracker/biscuit malt character in the aroma that blends harmoniously with the sour berry aroma. There are other smells in there too - dust/must, strawberries, dessert wine, and toffee. The flavor starts with a nice duo of berries and cereal grains. It gains in earthiness and fruity funk towards mid-palate with a definite red wine note slowly making itself known. The berries strengthen on the middle of the tongue, and there is some new funk at that point, too: earthy and musty like old leather (a hallmark of Brett). The finish is dry and spicy with some woody flavors and notes of dark currant jelly. The mouthfeel is full and fluid, creamy and slippery. The high carbonation gives the impression of strawberry soda at mid-rear of the tongue. Overall - holy crap is this good!!! I wouldnt have believed I could taste so fine a fluid three times in two days (Ive also been treated to Allagash Hugh Mallone and Brooklyner-Schneider Hopfen Weisse last night and today).

Extremely sour with a hint of lemon and possible some light fruits, though its tough to get through the funk.   Well, Im certainly intrigued by this one.

2329,"2008-04-26",3.7,"A- 750 ml Bottle, corked and caged. When opened a jet of bubbles overflows and leaves one running for the sink. It pours a beautiful tangerine color with a small, unassuming eggshell head which fades to just about nothing. Looks like a tropical sunset.

S- Smell is fainter than that of other brews with brett although it does have a sour cidery nose with hints of apple and pear along with a touch of sweetness.

T- Tastes predominately of mixed fruits apple is at the forefront followed by citrusey tangerine tones that end fairly sour. Bready and earthy with hints of its boozy nature hiding beneath the bouquet of flavors.

M- Mouthfeel is sticky and fairly viscous with a bubbly champagne like carbonation even after quite a bit escaped when it was opened and with a hearty pour.

D- This is so complex its hard to say that it is drinkable. As others have said I think there is a bit too much going on with this one. The Belgian pale aspect of it has some amazing flavors that get a little undercut by the brett. If one focuses just on the wild ale characteristics of this brew still something is left to be desired with balance. I think this one comes close but falls short in the fact that it is just trying too hard to be too many things. I like complexity but sometimes its good to master simple things then throwing a bunch of different fairly good aspects together. While I am pretty hard on this brew, it was excellent and I commend the people at Allagash for putting it together. With some minor adjustments it could be up there with some of the better Russian River wild Ales. Was it worth $20? Id say probably not but if youve got the itch sometimes you just have to scratch it. I might buy this one again if it were in the 12 dollar range.","California, USA","Lothore"

Smell: Aroma dominated by Brett with a dailed up musk factor and old, tired oak vessels with a lesser note of sour apple.

It pours a golden ruddy color with a good head, nice lacing, and a continuous stream of fine bubbles.  Big aroma dominated by oak and Belgian-y floral notes.  More of the same flavor-wise, with some late fruity notes (cherry?  peach?) and maybe a little anise.  A pleasantly bracing sharpness hits the back of the palate late.

L: Cloudy sunburnt orange with a frothy beige head that slowly receded into a thin layer of creamy foam. Splotchy lace rings the glass, this is off to a good start.

S: Light aromas of musty leather that bring forth a aromatic vinous fruitiness, scents of a dry sirah, along with a little green pear. Framing the edges is clove, earthy spices and touches of oak.

F&T: Just the right amount of carbonation to a firm creamy feel in the mouth, giving the light body a little heft. The yeast provides a spicy tartness to balance the sweet tastes of caramel, red grapes and green, not quite ripen pears. Towards the end sticky clove and a Brett earth mustiness emerges to go along with mild hop spiciness. The oak barrel tastes are pretty restrained, bare traces of green wood nuttiness. Finishes with a quenching dryness, lingering tastes of red grapes and crusty bread. Through out the taste is a mild acidity, giving the fruity flavors a soft bite.

Taste is tart, sweet and well rounded with lots of fruit and wine like character.  Its pretty amazing how much red wine character comes through and builds through this beer.  The rich flavors of red wine come through in a beer that is both slightly sour and also kind of sweet.

My nose catches a big shot of vinous champagne aroma. White grapes, brett, funky apple. 

A round sourness is the result of the brettanomyces here. Spicy, lemony, a bit oaky, citrus zest. Very complex and very delicious. 

The champagney carbonation really works nicely here. The body is light but not flimsy. Very crisp and clean finish.

2329,"2007-10-24",4.4,"2006 - Nicely deep toned orangey rusted color. Thickly firm medium sized capping of dusty yellowed foam plants itself well on top for a good length. Keeps a heavy skim and large foamed up collar always present. Thin sheets of lace and long stretchy strings coat the glass with nice decor.

Funky Brett sourness pours from the bottle and can be wiffed with ease. But getting past that is hard as its potency is quite booming. White wine, high ended sour stuff with a bit of funky bardyard notes of fresh hay and the animals that eat it. Some apple and berry tendencies emerge as it settles with time and warmth as does a bit of alcoholic warmth. 

Thankfully the taste is far more balanced and quite nice here. Geez, where to start...its well-rounded, full, bold, spicy, zingy, and full of fun popping flavors. A nice array of mild going sourness and funky spice balances very well together with a pleasingly complex fruit salad of grapes, apple, berries, citric peels, and melon. The dryness is perfect, it lets loose as it finishes letting more of the sweet fruityness shine through along with a bit of soured funk twinge and bite. They balance is amazing and very welcome in a beer like this.

Body is quite full, if not more so. Boldly forward and always developing more and more character and body as it goes. Delicately sour and dry, and If I dare say, its very handsome.

So...i get sour cherries..sour apples..sour oak....even sour strawberries...no malts or hops whatsoever. Body is medium, carbonation is high. As far as enjoyment....it is ok, but i think the oak and the sour flavors sort of work against each other on this one. Maybe aging would help? I have no idea.

Almonds and alcohol leading to a dry and warming finish. Full mouth feel and soft delightful carbonation.

Good fruity mix of Belgain malts and light funk to start the taste.  The finish is a little spicy and funky, and the alcohol is a bit detectable.

Hazy orange golden with a one finger off-white head, lots of streams of bubbles making their way to the top.  First whiff gives way to wonderful brett, followed by some vanilla and oak.  Granny smith apples with tart and bitter grapefruit, a moderate amount of caramel and yeast.  The brett stays strong in the flavor and continues to the semidry finish.  This wasnt quite as sweet as the aroma led on, but the aroma was not all that sweet to begin with.  Oak and vanilla was still apparent, as was a good amount of fruitiness again.  There is also some light spices.  Overall bitterness was low--mainly lightly sweet and tart.  Alcohol very well hidden.  Moderate carbonation with a medium body.  This was quite a tasty brew, very enjoyable.  Rerate January 2007 vintage--more of an update, really.  Basically theres tons of fruity pineapple, grapefruit and leathery Brett at this point.  Even a little grapey.  Very dry, some alcohol still noted, still low bitterness.  Still a great beer--I wish I had a fresh bottle to compare, but as it is, a stupendous Brett bomb.  Im keeping the rating the same--this is holding up very very well.

January 2007 Bottling

Interlude poured a hazy copper that glowed orange when held to the light. A 1 finger white head formed on the pour that faded to a thin cap with chunky edges. Minimal slow rising carbonation bubbles. Leaves chunky drink lines after each sip.

Scent begins with goldenrod and that barnyard funkiness. Mild tart cherries and a touch of lemony citrus. Maybe its my imagination but when I take deep whiffs I pick up mild oak. Very complex aromas that Ive only scratched the surface on.

The flavor is more complex than the aroma. Things begin with a slight lemon rind bitterness. Mid palate I get hit with a wave of that funkiness along with hay. Mild citric flavors come through toward the end finishing up with orange rind and a solid hop snap on the swallow. Again, Ive only scratched the surface on the complexity of flavors.

Lighter body with a slight stickinesson the tongue. Mild alcohol on the swallow as this beer warms.

The flavor makes this an easy drinker but the complex flavors will wear out the tastebuds.

A truly complex beer with a great idea behind it. Im looking forward to trying Allagashs other special releases. A really great concept behind this beer that I look forward to drinking again.

Aroma is decent - brett, orange peel, green pepper, slight spiciness, interesting light malt backbone that adds a pleasant sweetness.  I thought this beer was way to acidic at first, but it grew on me.  Lots of apple and grapefruit in the flavor - theres a decent spicy component, but it seems to block some of the other complexities here.  I can hardly taste any oak, and I dont get any red wine flavors either, but maybe thats a good thing.  Decent finish, I wish there was a bit more bitterness, but that spiciness dominates.

2329,"2007-04-26",4.2,"Yes indeed. $20 a bottle. Ouch. Pours a lot darker than expected -- but not that dark -- but the aroma was just as I imagined it: heavenly. It seems with the top notch belgians, the aroma really is the place for the beer to shine, and shine Interlude does. Buttery vanilla, funky hay, tart grapes, and white chocolate dipped strawberries, the complexity and brilliance of the aroma is near unmatched. 

Sadly though, its all downhill from there. But does that surprise anyone? Thats not to say this tastes bad -- not even close. Ive just yet to find a world-class beer whos flavor can match the subtle complexity of its aroma. Flavor is a lot more herbal, dry, buttery and bretty than the aroma, but lacks any sort of tartness. Big on the savory herbal qualities, but missing any sort of fruit. Yeast dominated, perhaps, but who can complain about that?

This truly is a world class beer, and I knew going in to it that I should probably cellar this bottle -- 6 months old -- for at least a year longer. But I couldnt help myself, and now, I am no doubt another $20 in the hole, because to not buy another one of these and cellar it would be plain foolish.

2329,"2007-04-17",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 9, 2008 2007 - Great looking cloudy peach and rusty golden orange colored body.  Nose of old oranges, but that’s a small part of it – really it is mostly a musty yogurt and brett scent, soft and muddy, lightly acidic on the nose, but muddled would be the best word… it doesn’t really do much, just sits there muddled and the orange and brett smells don’t work together at all.  Mildly crisp with a doughy orange and peach flavor, a little lactic, only slightly sour.  Again it just doesn’t work, like it’s trying too many things, and it’s stuck between being a sour ale and being a sweet yeast-heavy Belgian golden.  Still it certainly tastes good but it’s no godsend, it has it’s problems.  The light yogurt and tannic flavors are nice, though.  


2006 - a lot of apple, not green apple that you’d associate with acetylhyde, but a crisp red apple smell and flavor throughout the drink.  Lots of biscuits and red apple skins, and a prickly and spicy brett character.  I’m surprised at how different this is compared to both the 2007 and 2005... those two were more similar to each other, while this one is pretty different with all of the strange apple and candy sugar flavors. 


2005 - Soft bretty nose, sweaty and fruity and spicy all at the same time - tart, dried fruit, banana and pineapple, lightly prickly and dry, Full, frothy, a bit of sweet honey as well.  Quite good, but not huge development of brett.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Continuous C02 release from the bottom of the glass. Fore of the tongue is tart, slightly to medium astringency, some oak notes. Back of the tongue is banana, tartness, yeast, funk.

The first impressions on the nose are of the vinous and oak variety.. some spicy, dry yeast and Brett behind... lighter fruits and more deeply-rooted vinous character to round it out... more aging influence than underlying brew, but quite nice!  The flavor picked up plenty of vinous and oaky notes, too.. with a wonderful addition of dried cherries.. sour at times, with some overt alcohol on the back-end.. funky and tasty!  Lively on the palate with warming, bubbly vinous esters tingling the gums... dries out as it nears the finish, leaving lenghty wine and funky Brett notes.

2329,"2007-03-30",4.2,"Deep golden cloudy body, oily in appearance. Tall frothy off white head, recession reluctant. Lacing is thick and arc shaped. Aroma is sweet and moderately tart, with notes of oranges, brettanomyces, oak, red wine grapes, cherry, light caramel and cumin-based spice and a touch of must and vanilla beans. Truly exciting nose, though more reserved than Id like. All reservations are cast aside in a flavor that is similar, but dialed up several notches. Brett is crushing in its sourness, fading quickly to pleasurable levels that dont throw the rest of the quaff into acetic dissarray. Yeast is moderately funky and well blended into the mold, a beer that is clearly Belgian in inspiration, even moreso in a farmhouse-rooted expression. Vibrant but never overwhelming carbonation pushes forth a tart citric acidity that is refreshing and complex. Finishes bold and medium dry. Alcohol is dutifully masked throughout. Palate is light to medium bodied, dry with sweet intervals and biting pepper notes. Very refreshing, a daring example. Another lesson from Allagash, I hope many American brewers experimenting with Belgian styles are taking notes. This is how you do it.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Flavor misses the mark a bit for me with a funky corn-adjunct-like sour-mash flavor that seemed out of place. Other flavors taking their turn were a subdued but prickly hop bitterness, grassy grains, clover, a touch of acetic acid and plenty of candy-sweet malts.

The wine side leans more towards the fruit forward Sirah.  Fan-fn-tastic aroma.  Medium / full body that is lush and rich with some unobtrusive sharp carbonation.  The flavor starts with a mix of Belgium style earthiness and dry red wine that still seems more Sirah than Merlot - and thats fine with me since I like Sirahs better.  There is also some nectarine and pepper like spice along with a tannin aspect.  There is a light sweetness, but this is mainly drhy.  The finish is sharp and wine-like with earthy malt and yeast and spicy hops becoming noticable.  What a succesful experiment.

Light crisp and tart with a succulent fruity flavor (definate vinuous notes) that makes the mouth salivate.  More wet red oak and sourness.  Sourness lasts through late swallow and leaves with a distince ethanol flavor.  Quite strong actually and a little overpowering.

Further olfactory processing reveals some woodiness and vinous notes. Letting the taste buds in on the fun is well worth the wait. Funky barnyard flavors come out at first then some more vinous flavors, especially post swallow. The palate is wine like, other than the fact that is is carbonated of course. I like this one a lot.

Crisp tart apples, oak, attic/dry barn floral soap and apple peels all come to mind with a sniff of this one. Reminds me of my youth and going to the apple orchard to pick up apples in the fall and watching the sorting and making of fresh apple cider. Should likely get another point just for that, but Ill refrain. The first sip is a real eye-opener. Not the sweet cider flavors I was expecting. Just looked at Oakes notes and I concur, but I will continue. Light sweet malt is quickly swept away by a rush dust from the granary. This really does leave a nice sheet of foam on the glass.  Light citric backdrop which keeps this one lively. This has some of the qualities of RR Temptation, but lacks some of the depth. Enjoyable, but missing that little something extra.

Lovely Brett stylings of hay, mango, vanilla, honey, vanilla, oak, earthy Noble hop resin, fresh dough, sweet oranges and some light spice like grains of paradise.  The body is lively and fairly smooth considering the ample carbonation.  The flavor is sweet up front with layered malt smoothed by oak and vanilla.  The Brett adds a fruity, tart yeast element before a rather pronounced hop bitterness at the end.  Upon further examination, there is virtually no detectable alcohol presence whatsoever.  This is a smooth, flavorful, elegant yet aggressive, beauty from Allagash.  All the Belgian Brett lovers will dig on this something fierce, I would think.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

2005 vintage bottle sampled in late June, 2008.  The beer pours to a dark golden bronzed amber body with tons of visible carbonation and a thin fizzy white head.  Sexy color and vibrancy.  Love the carbonation.  The aroma is amazing!  Sour starfruit is perfectly blended with oak, Belgian yeasts that aren’t overly done, and lightly vinous notes.  Smells kind of like a gueuze/kriek/saison.  The flavor is very, very nice.  Tart leathery acid up front that blends into an Orval-like saison and yeasty tart starfruit.  Pears, orange rind, lemons meets oaken red grapes.  No one component is too sharp.  Superbly balanced.  The palate is surprisingly not over carbonated for this beer.

Brett in the nose is balanced with the vinuous qualities: tartness and red wine; full, appetizing, complex nose.  The belgian profile underneath seems to suggest an abbey tripel: plenty of spice, pepper, yeast; all of which is well-balanced by the barrel aging and secondary fermentation; the tartness is engaging without being overwhelming (shows the reserve of Russian River); the vinuous qualities are well-blended, showing Burgundy/Merlot qualities, light tannins, and oak.

Wow the wine comes through, not in the best way, astringent yeast, then dry and bitter while not the greatest it still aint bad and is drinkable. This is too dry and doesnt allow the flavors to merge. The wine taste fights the other boozy wood flavors. Some cherry & strawberry & honey are there but they are overshadowed.

Wow, dark fruits, cherries, some slightly sweet notes in there, dry, oaky, tannins, vinous/red wine, brett funk, slight tartness. Just a great ""bruin"" type flavor with that Orval-brett type thing supporing the base beer. Fantastic even if pricey! Original rating: By far, this is the best Allagash brew Ive had to date. Poured an amber color with a small modest head that didnt lace impressively. Appearance was the most plain part of the beer. The aroma was excellent, cherries, grapes, and apples with a touch of funk as it warmed. The flavor was way complex, cherries, vanilla, some hints of wine, and oak. The funk was almost absent initially (50F) outside of some musty presence. As it warmed, a very light and subtle barnhouse funk came out, but it certainly wasnt the feature. Mouthfeel was intially thick and syruppy, but this thing thinned and became a delight after a few minutes (55F?). The carbonation was moderately done.","","User37895"

Smooth oak appetencies line the mouth by means of flavor.  Lemon rinds give an acidic sweetness while mushy bananas (easy on the sugar) help to round it out.  Vanilla and cloves help with the smoothing, yet, lest to say, the chardonnay & pinot grape-like flavors pull the ale in a significantly souring manner.  Orange and cotton blossoms impart a pillowy floralness with substance.  Pepper, lilacs, coriander, lemon chiffon and winey oak keep adding nuances.  Effervescence is at its zenith, invoking enjoyable titillations when parried with the margarine-like coating of the mouth.  Complexity and perplexity intertwine.

As I pour this beer I get an intense, bright, fruity aromatic note that most reminds me of strawberries.  The beer appearance is an orangish, red-gold color, fairly hazy and topped by a frothy tan colored head.  The up front fruitiness, while still in the nose, is drowned out by the austere, funky Brett notes in the main nose of this beer.  Notes of berries intermingle with notes of earth and damp wood, as well as a note of sour acidity that is almost, though not quite, reminiscent of lemons.  The intense fruitiness is really the striking thing, at least to me, about the aroma the typical funky Brett notes are of course here, but that intense, sweet berry fruit character is quite a pleasant balance to the funkiness.

The taste is initially pretty darn tart.  I was not expecting this level of sour, though it is quite mild for most intentionally soured beers, but not necessarily ones that advertise the use of Brettanomyces.  Again that berry note is here in the taste, it starts up in the middle of a quaff and lingers on through to the finish.  Notes of green grapes and tart apples join the fresh berry notes to round out the fruit flavors that I find in the flavors.  I wonder if the berry notes are from the aging in the wine barrels, but it seems so vibrant that I am just not convinced that it is from the wine barrel aging.  The beer is fairly light, especially when one considers the alcohol content, and is easily quaffed, yet tends to linger and lightly stick to the palate.  Of course there is a solid Brett character here as well, though it is not as prominent in the flavor as it was in the nose.  Notes of  musty cobwebs linger on almost ephemerally in the mouth as sharp almost urea-like notes cut through, but can not quite vanquish them entirely.

What an enjoyable brew this is.  The balance of this beer is enlightening; fresh vibrant fruit notes intermingle with the funky wild yeast notes and provide an entirety to this tipple that the individual components could not hope to achieve.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2329,"2006-04-11",4.3,"Bottle from Super Saver, Somerville, NJ.  Lovely bottle with hang tag.  As I uncork this one, the pressure is so intense that the cork flies at about 100 mph after a ear-ringing pop, hitting the ceiling, then the floor, then the door.  I did my best Fred Eckhardt impression and ""listened"" to this beer, and as the head dissipated, the beer made a sound not unlike the sound a womans nether region makes when she gets nude and turned on and then repeatedly closes and opens her legs.  Lovely, indeed.  The pour was impressive, a hazy coppery color with some ruby hints, showing a 1-finger off-white head.  The aroma is intense, and starts with a big cherry/berry blast to the olfactory cells, followed by a nice oaky bourbony funky burst, and some lambicy cobwebby malts, cabernet, and a large dose of that Cantillon smell.  The flavor is fruity, on the citric funky side, with a solid mid-palate oaky bourbon element, and also some caberney hints.  This one, as it warms, assumes multiple taste qualities, at one time or another resembling a lambic, a cabernet, and finishing as an oaky bourbony creation resembling Makers Mark as it warms to ambient temperature.  The only comparable beers I can think of would be Stewarts Decathlon and Cherry Bourbathon.  This one is unique, delicious, and worth the 17 bucks I paid for it.

The wine oak aging can definitely be notice but does not overtake the beer. Funky Brett brings a nice finish to this beer.

Soft carbonation gently prickles the palate. Understatedly sharp, initially, with an herbal snap of yeast blanketed by a pillow-soft malt and buttery oak foundation. Brett character is short-lived, but packs enough force to cut the softness, depositing dusty crushed-mineral grittiness to the prominent malt huskiness. Lightly toasted hay harmonizes with the buttery oak. Immensely juicy and vinous, but the presence of tannins is minimal, which allows a supple medley of tropical fruitiness to glow. Carbonation softens and the silkiness peaks at higher temperatures. Malt character is exceptionally focused, rich and bright, and accentuates a late hint of tart pineapple as the flavors evolve. Finishes much fluffier than it is dry, with full-fledged pepper dusted malts and lingering bandage phenols. Just a superb beer thats highly appetizing due to the subtle acidity and fairly light weight, but equally satisfying due to the restrained dryness and assertive malt richness. More sour depth is all this really needs. Thanks, Clark!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

The brett tickles the nose with its dryish pineapple, limey, exotic musty flavors, while the wine barrels offer a different floral to look at. Im at first surprised by the syrah and merlot declared origins as the grape character certainly seem paler, tarter, not overly tannic and juicy enough. Gentle mineral character remind of salt briefly, but the fruits offer flavours to match, notably in the shape of sweet berries, banana, apple. Crunchy in its yeastiness, like an elaborated pie crunch slowly heads toward sourdough territory as the tartness grows, remaining centered on the vinous fruitiness and oaky elegance. Soft rounded body drinks easily, light-medium in size with delicate if very active carbonation. Despite the juicy profile being pretty sweet initially, it dries out a fair bit toward the finish. Restrained, peaceful. This is delicious and a revelation to one who thought their barrel experiments never approached the originals, I may not enjoy it as much as their triple, but few other brewers would have this as my second favourite of their lineup.

-A lumpy veil of creamy head remains over a galvanized, metallic orange.

-Sweet orange zests in perfect harmony with the wooden wilderness, a masterful, orchestral deployment.
-Body is full, and not completely clean, which is lots of fun for such a strong ale; this is a hefty number.

What if you dig deeper?
-White wine fruitiness is perfectly integrated to the well-balanced flavors.
-The aftertaste is mellow, maybe too much so since I would have liked the flavors to be prolonged.
-Caramel sweetness, mild tartness, and alcohol warmth develop with each sip, building complexity.
-The brewers intricate and passionate mind is easily palpable.

Will this nascent wild ale abundance be a fad?
-If they all can reach the beauty of Ommegeddon, MoBetta Bretta, Nerdlinger, Interlude, Le Woody, etc., I really dont mind!

The third combines the two beautifully; fruity red wine pushing around some funky banana, with a very small hint of sweet toffee and diacetyl lurking in the background. Swirling brings out that Allagash yeast aroma.  The wine and beer notes blend just as well in the flavor. It starts slightly funky, with backing pear, banana, and light cloves. The wine comes in near the middle, with light berry, grape, and oak flavors. The finish is dry, with some oak and a tiny hint of alcohol. Oily mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation.

Theres a point just before the finish at which the Saison and wine flavors dont mix well. Flavor -1. Still excellent the rest of the way through.","Winchester, Virginia, USA","jmuhops"
2329,"2006-02-08",4.4,"750 mL bottle.  Over time, Ive learned to go into these new beers with a reserved sense of anticipation.  Read into the hype, and youre just asking to be let down.  Reading about the price tag of this one made me apprehensive, so when I found it for $12, I jumped.  To my surprise, the cork didnt pop with a thunder, and it didnt spill all over as other saisons and other Allagash has done.  When slightly chilled, this is pretty good.  Aroma is mostly horseblanket and musk, but theres an underlying banana and breadiness that arises as it warms.  The flavor and mouthfeel really take off with the temperature.  In fact, I regret not letting the bottle get to room temp before indulging.  The brett is first and foremost.  Splendid.  Dry, lip puckering and sweet, all at once.  Banana, candi sugar, white grape and even a little cherry are in the flavor.  This is 9.5%, you say?  Normally the alcohol content comes marching through in the Allagash brews, but this is hidden nicely. Excellent job by Allagash.  Id like to see them add this to the normal rotation.  Now, time to get a few more bottles for storage.","Windsor, Connecticut, USA","SwedeDog"

2329,"2006-02-06",3.9,"A Saison?  It tastes to me like an oak aged lambic.  Almost no head with a light cognac caramel coloring.  Sour nose with spice red wine notes.  Avalilable at Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA","Massachusetts, USA","fluids"
2329,"2006-02-05",4.0,"Bottle, shared with Hopscotch and WHKinger.  Cloudy orange with a huge off-white foamy head.  Strong aroma of nice merlot with background of cherry, oak and leather.  Fruity tartness up front with a medium dry finish.  Stil just a bit much alcohol coming through to be a great beer.  I plan on picking another up to cellar for a year or two before trying it again.","West Virginia, USA","growler"

2329,"2006-02-04",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2008 (2/23/08, 750ml bottle, 2005 vintage) Given how much as my wife and I loved this beer the first time we tried it, I had to acquire another bottle from that initial batch, which we let sit for far too long (even though part of the delay was due to Kathy getting pregnant and then being a nursing mother).  Aroma is medium sweet, the brett is stronger than the wine now, but theres still some pear/cabernet sauvignon, together with some tropical fruit, funk, light lemon.  Taste is mild sweet, oaky white wine, some Brett, berry, tropical fruit.  Some alcohol warming in the finish.  Medium-full body with some syrup, light acidity.  With the disappearance of the red wine characteristics, my appreciation of this beer is sadly diminished.  Nevertheless, it still is a lovely beer.  (8/4/7/4/15)

(2/4/06, 750ml bottle, 2005 vintage) Cloudy golden body with small off-white head.  Aroma is medium sweet, vinous (grape, plum, some cherry, light tannins), light duskiness.  Taste is medium sweet, vinous (merlot), some oak, brettanomyces, dusky, white grape.  Very fruity, and the brett imparts a white wine characteristic.  Medium body, some effervescence.  Truly a fusion of beer and wine -- unique just how much the wine qualities are imparted in this beer, well beyond what a wine cask can provide.  (9/3/8/4/17)","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
2329,"2006-02-04",4.5,"This beer was enough to bring me out of hibernation, for the time being, at least.  I enjoy wine, though Im not a connoisseur, so this beer was wonderful to me.  The appearance is innocent looking -- innocuous -- with a quickly dispersing head and a bright, inviting ruby-tan color.  Its kind of the color of tanned leather.  The aroma has a lambic quality, with some cherry sourness and hints of the Syrah from the barrels used to age the beer.  Very winey.  The flavor is bright, but rich.  Its a little like a cross between a sauvingon blanc (bright, crisp, peary) or champagne and a merlot (oaky, rich, serious).  There are still beer qualities, though, especially with the yeastiness that you dont find as much in wine.  The palate is crisp.  The beer dances across the tongue like a bright white wine or champagne.  Theres a little bit of pear and sauvingnon blanc in the palate, as well.  Its nicely balanced and lovely.  Mmmmm.","Washington DC, USA","Kathy"
2329,"2006-02-03",4.0,"Okay, if you are a brettanomyces fan this is a very excellent beer, I some what and I found it very interesting.  Mine is orange and pretty cloudy.  It had a moderate white head when it was pour, but that is a distance memory now.    Tart fruity aroma, grapes are apparent as is the barn yard leathery flavors found in many Brett beers.  Well carbonated, bubbly.  Dry finish almost like a dry champange.  Save a bottle or two of this one, I think its going to be interesting.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
2329,"2006-02-01",4.6,"After opening with a nice ""thud,"" aromas of citrus, bananas and beautiful tarte sugar immediately permiated the air.  The head, which was a creamy white, is generously fed by the carbonation below generated by the Duvel tupil this one was poured into.  The color was a crystal clear amber with no trace of haze to be seen.  Smells of citrus, peaches, tarte malt, grapes, and some spices.  Tastes lightly sour with some peppery splashes.  Somewhat nutty, but lacking the fruity qualities with the exception of some bananas and tarte cherries.  Mouthfeel is splashy with some tingliness to it.  Finish is lightly sour, but not as much so as I was hoping.  The alcohol is well masked in this one, making it yet another excellent limited offering from Allagash.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
2329,"2006-01-31",4.4,"hazy, pinkish, fizzy with a small white head.  sweet, fruity aroma.  very complex taste, a bit tart with some cherry overtones, a bit sweet and citrusy, a wide variety of fruit tastes.  some really great stuff.  i cant wait to age some.","USA","hatchy"
2329,"2006-01-25",4.3,"2005 bottle. 750 mL. As soon as I popped the cork on this bad boy I noticed a distinct wine like smell wafting my way. Hazy medium orange color with hints of pink and a short lasting fizzy white head. Gorgeous color really. Aroma has notes of peaches, cherries, and oak with just a hint of farmhouse saison smells and obvious wine. I really dont know a damn thing about wine. I wouldnt know the difference between a merlot and a syrah if my life depended on it. What I do know is that there is a definite wine flavor and aroma contributing to this beer. In this particular beer, you can faintly detect what is probably a fairly generic Saison and a fairly generic wine. When the slightly peppery and lemony saison flavors mix with cherry and oak flavors from the barrels you are left with an incredibly complex and challenging beer. The challenge is detecting every single slight flavor note. I get cherry, peach, black pepper, bread, lemon, and red grapes out of this. Im sure a different person with a different palate could get a myriad of different flavors. One thing Im sure of is that you cant get a full idea of what this beer has to offer from a small sample at a beer festival. Highly recommended. I truly hope that Allagash continues to make this gem..","Durham, North Carolina, USA","Magjayran"

2329,"2006-01-08",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2007 2007 750mL Bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy/fizzy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy medium amber.

Medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic. Seems a bit different (and better) than what I had at the Jan 06 Vail fest; darker and more alcoholic.

November 2005. Bottle at the brewery. Dark amber body with a small but full white head. Mild funk in the aroma is backed up with a lot of moderate fruit and malt. Flavour has pervasive fruit notes with a pleasant mild sourness giving your mouth a bit of a wake up call. Lingering mild booziness in the finish belies the strength of the brew but is not at all unpleasant. Medium bodied palate. Im not a sour beer lover but this was quite nice. Notes are a bit lacking, distracted by the brewery surroundings.  Thanks again Rob! 7/3/7/4/15-3.6","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
2329,"2005-11-05",3.7,"On draught at NEBF, 10/29/2005.  Pours a very foamy head and an unfiltered deep golden-orange body.  Head is off-white and very well-retained, with plenty of lacing present.  Aroma begins with brett, but also the Allagash signature yeast, quite thick, reminding me somewhat of the trippels aroma.  Some white pepper notes, light fruits and a hint of caramel and cookie like sweetness.  The brett is significantly less expressive than, say, Ommegeddon, but its a bit different of a beer.  Hops presence is marginally apparent, as in most Allagash beers.  Flavor begins sweet and malty, with a huge yeast chewiness (saccharomyces) followed by peppery notes of brett dryness, light cherries, almonds and vanilla.  Spicy, bready, earthy notes emerge as it warms, on the finish, with a fairly warming character and a real chewy, bordering meaty texture.  Body is surprisingly medium-full for the style with a bit too much Allagash signature yeast apparency.  The carbonation is low, but its a draught sample, so its not the nice bottle conditioned carbonation that should help the texture, when bottled.  Hoping that the brett continues to ferment the beer and some of the thick, boderline meaty yeast dies off in apparency.  Very solid beer though, I think Im just biased because I love huge amounts of brett and this one is much more reserved in its brett character.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
