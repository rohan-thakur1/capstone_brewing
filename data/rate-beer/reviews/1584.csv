1584,"2017-06-21",3.1,"Bottle - Light creamy yeast notes. Very thick and rich on the palate. Booze and creamy notes dominate. Almost milkshake like.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
1584,"2016-12-14",3.4,"Very nice nigori sold at local Japanese markets. A little on the boozy side but wonderful rich mouth feel and sweet fruity undertones. Easy drinking.","California, USA","John_hmstr"
1584,"2015-12-29",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2015 Slightly different bottle, I think mine was a year-end version. Sample at Aki-Oki Chabara regional goods shop. It poured a cloudy white had a sweet fruity aroma. Well balanced flavor, sweet without being cloying.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
1584,"2015-10-08",3.4,"Bottle sample. Thanks rayaron. Cloudy white color. Aroma of coconut, liquor, vanilla and mlik. Very sweet, with flavors of milk, coconut, banana, pineapple and alcohol. Full-bodied, rough texture. Boozy but interesting.","ISRAEL","zvsn"
1584,"2015-09-28",3.6,"Bottle at Taizu restaurant, Tel Aviv. As ""Kikusui Perfect Snow"". Opaque white. Fruity aroma (pineapple, pear) with rice and hint of coconut milk. Sweetish flavor with notes of grapefruit, pineapple and rice, a bit alcoholic but I couldnt guess its 21% abv. Very nice Sake.","Kfar Saba, ISRAEL","rayaron"
1584,"2015-07-10",3.0,"Bottle at home. Pours cloudy white and still. Aroma is sweet rice, light banana notes and alcohol. Flavor is sweet rice and banana, spicy alcohol and a dry finish. Full body.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
1584,"2014-09-29",3.3,"Bottle for poker. Pours milky white. Nose is tropical fruit and rice. Tastes of pineapple rine, coconut, talc, rice, and some almonds. Grainy rough mouthfeel and touch of harsh alcohol on finish.","New York, USA","Jow"
1584,"2013-01-05",3.8,"180 ml can. Poured ice cold.  Very cloudy, milky, with rice particles. Creamy vanilla nose, nutmeg, rice pudding. Very sweet and thuck, very strong alcohol burn, light mint, coconut, pineapple, pina colada-like, alcoholic rice pudding. It is very strange and strong, though i dig it. A dessert sake, maybe, more like a sweet creamy cocktail. Crazy and great.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
1584,"2012-07-23",3.6,"Bottle shared with Vi at Ippudo. Went very well with the spicy root appetizer, and I feel this Sake would go great with spicy food in general. Pours a thick, milky white body with spotty grainy sediment. Mouthfeel is thick and rich with notes of sweet fruit, light yeast, rice and booze in the finish.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
1584,"2006-08-03",3.3,"300mL Bottle: Super duper thick and chunky, like poridge. Coats the side of the glass in various size grains. The nose is a bit musky with some barny character along with the sweet coconut koji note. The nose isnt that bad actually. The flavor is about half the battle with a syrupy sweet alcohol enriched taste and a grainy rice and texture. Some light bamboo and cedar notes. Whoa, the sweetness, alcoholness and chewyness make this quite a load to drink all in one session, especially when youre racing the clock to drink it while chilled before the alcohol starts to wake up and beat you up. Thanks to Dan for this sweet warm cloudy dream.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1584,"2004-10-27",3.1,"Typical cloudy Nigori, strong alcohol smell with sweet grainy scent. Sweet tasting, a bit chewy...slight wood flavor. Well, now a strong wood flavor but that is due to the ""Masu"" (traditional square cedar drinking bowls). Best not to swirl this around, the alcohol becomes overwhelming when warm. Nigoris are at their best chilled. Ive had many better sakes but then again a few worse. If youre a sake fan, or better yet, a Nigorizake fan, give this a try.
