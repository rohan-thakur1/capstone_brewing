515,"2017-05-28",4.6,"Pite na Urusie. Jak dla mnie najfajniesze piwo bottlesharingu. W zapachu deserowo - miąsz z malin plus soczek. W smaku naturalne intensywne do bólu maliny. Po prostu cudo.","Grodków, POLAND","mygeekway"
515,"2017-05-25",4.0,"Aromat: świetny i intensywny, brandy i świeże maliny, suszone owoce- śliwki, figi, karmel. Aromat maliny bardzo owocowy i naturalny.
Wygląd: brunatne z czerwonawymi odcieniami, piana na centymetr, grubopęcherzykowa, jasnobeżowa, dosyć szybko zanika.
Smak: bardzo złożony, na początku świeża słodycz malin, dalej słodycz od karmelu, słodkie owoce, figi, daktyle, rodzynki, suszona śliwka. Później wchodzi cierpkość świeżych malin, cierpki sok z owoców leśnych, malin, żurawiny, borówki, jeżyny, nuty wytrawnego wina. Na koniec zaś atakuje ostre brandy i drewno od beczki, wywołujące odczucie silnego ściągania na języku. Bardzo dobrze ułożone i zbalansowane, splatają się tu słodycz, cierpkość i gorycz owoców leśnych, taka jak od czerwonych borówek. Laktozy na szczęście w ogóle tu nie czuje, ale piwo jest bardzo gładkie i zdradliwie wydaje się być dosyć lekkie. Finisz słodko kwaśno gorzki, cały czas ściąganie na języku. W smaku i zapachu trochę jak malinowa nalewka, ale jest zdecydowanie bardziej wykwintne i cierpkie. Piwo niezwykle ciekawe i bogate, smakowało mi zdecydowanie.","Kraków, POLAND","bjorn77"

Nice quad (as expected) but heavy on the raspberry. Not really able to detect anybody the brandy barrel. A nice drink but a tad too fruity, and too expensive.
