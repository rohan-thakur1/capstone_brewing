1073,"2017-04-24",3.2,"16oz bottle - First off Ill say I dont really drink ciders and such. The pour is a clear light bubbly med gold with virtually no head, just a white ring. The aroma is pear syrup, apple juice, light floral yeast and nectar. Effervescent mouthfeel. Lots of sweet pear and apple upfront with a fruity but drier finish.","Bayfield, Colorado, USA","CObiased"

Appearance: Transparent pale yellow pour with very soft carbonation holding a ring of bubbly, thin head.
