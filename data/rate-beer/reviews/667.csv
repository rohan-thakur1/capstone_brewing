667,"2017-05-30",4.1,"I seem to have stumbled upon a Real Ale tap takeover at Hughies as only 6 of the 20 taps are other brands. This one is hazy auburn with a finger of tan foam. Big aroma of dried cherries and other dark fruits, caramel and toffee. Taste is more of the same plus a strong boozy kick.","Houston, Texas, USA","dfinney23"
667,"2016-08-31",4.1,"Tap at Petrol - murky, brown, wimpy head. Nice aroma, dark fruits, tea leaves, caramel. Very good on the tongue.... Caramel, earthiness, wood, slight booziness, very well done. One of their best.","Katy, Texas, USA","Andrew196"
667,"2016-07-27",3.7,"Draft at whip-in. Pours a cloudy brownish red color. Quarter inch white head. Paint thinner and plums. Currant and plums flavor. Medium mouthfeel. Light sourness.","Bellaire, Texas, USA","gephross100"
667,"2016-03-26",3.2,"Tap at Real Ale brewery. Aroma: Malty, Scotch aroma; Appearance: dark amber with white head; Taste: definitely boozy as if from Scotch barrel; malty, sweet; Palate: odd aftertaste that wasnt completely pleasant; heavy body: Overall: disappointing; would probably not get again.","Round Rock, Texas, USA","darbeer75"
667,"2016-01-12",4.1,"(En fût à Hopfields): Ça goûte exactement le Porto. Douceur boisée, tabac, épices, purée de mûres et une agréable légèreté.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
667,"2015-04-13",4.1,"On tap at the Big Texas Beer Fest. Poured an unfiltered murky brown with a beige head. Taste of caramel malts, sweet, dark fruits, with a warming boozy finish. Average carbonation, medium body. Damn good brew!","Garland, Texas, USA","TizzleJizzle"
667,"2015-04-05",4.6,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2015 Take a whiff only if youre willing to drown in strong raisins, caramel, Guinness fudge, and oaky vanilla notes. Oh, Son of Mary. Unlike anything else. It continues with plums, preserved figs, and other dried fruits that give way to some of the breadier malty notes and a hint of peat and booze. The mouthfeel is firm but silky, with low carbonation and a dense body. The sugary, fruity sweetness overpowers the bitterness on the palate and conceals the alcohol well. Would make a hearty followup to a nice chunk of ribeye. A sumptuous dessert and a dangerous beast unto itself. Silly good.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"
667,"2014-06-19",4.0,"Pours a reddish brown color with off-white head. Oak, dark fruits, scotch, sweetness, and some nuts on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes warming.","Dallas, Texas, USA","TXBadger"

667,"2013-11-11",3.6,"Hand bottle thanks to errl. Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours a murky brown with a thin, beige head of foam. The aroma is very wine forward and initially made me think this was going to be sour. The taste lent nothing of the sort. Being into that sort of thing, I was just slightly let down about that. The taste was more red wine and earthy sweetness. Some fruity complexities snuck in there as well. Nice barrel treatment. Kind of wish I had opened it a little sooner.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
667,"2013-11-06",3.9,"Hand bottle extra from errl. Youre the man. Deep cloudy brown. Thought this was bourbon barrel aged from the initial nose....lots of vanilla barrel characteristics and super caramel and toffee malts, light smoke maybe some dried orange peel. Taste is sweet malty core but cleansing red wine tannins and tardiness shows through with a lingering peaty smokiness. Really unique and all works well together. Tad hot.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"
667,"2013-09-19",3.9,"Murky red brown pour with no head. Aroma is tart berries, caramel, and strong barrel. Tart has an initial tart fruitiness to that goes into caramel and brown sugar sweetness. Wood and some tannic qualities are also in there. Slick texture. This is an interesting beer.","Corinth, Texas, USA","jhamp9"
667,"2013-07-25",4.0,"Nice twist on the real heavy. Pleasant sweet malt aroma associated with Scotch Ale with an additional fruity twist. Very dark brown with a minimal head. Smooth and oily. Sharp caramel flavors with an alcohol bite. The oak became apparent about half-way through with a mix of dryness I guess came from the wine barrel. Good strong stuff.","The Colony, Texas, USA","kevinator"
667,"2013-07-20",3.9,"Draft at Mellow Mushroom Spring TX. Brown and murky with no head. Its ugly. But one sniff of the big barrel aging brings this to life. Taste is full of barrel, some sweetness thats not offputting (not a fan of too sweet beers) and goes down way too easy. Alcohol is present but fits in. Very nice!","Seattle still not near Beersel., Washington, USA","bleeng"
667,"2013-06-12",3.7,"Muddy brownish color with a thin head. Aroma full of fruit and wood. Taste is sweet malt and fruit with plenty of wood and some booze. Nice.","Richmond, Texas, USA","rougeau13"

667,"2010-10-21",3.9,"On tap at the RealTail party.  Poured a clear, glowing scotch-colored (go figure) body and some off-white head.  Red wine, caramel, peat and some smoke on the nose.  Flavors were toasty, peaty, alcoholy, some sour and some whiskey.  Coarse, active carbonation with a medium mouthfeel.  A good choice for barrel aging.","San Antonio, Texas, USA","BarZigKin"
667,"2010-07-19",3.9,"Tap at Freetail. A caramel brown color beer with no head. The aroma is sweet, vanilla, and a really nice bourbon scent that was not overpowering but just enough to be there. I really could not stop smelling this. The taste was sweet, boubon, caramel, port or sherry like and was my favorite of the Real Ale barrel aged beers that day.","San Antonio, Texas, USA","Hopper"

667,"2010-07-17",4.1,"On tap at RealTail at Freetail Brewing Co in San Antonio on July 17, 2010.  Ive waited a ling time for this.  Highlander has an orange-mahogany color, no carbonation, and a white head.  Nose of oak, malt, and moss.  A divine smell!  Thin mouth feel, but a wacky delicious flavor with dark sugars, a little sour bite at the back of the jaw, and hints of raisins or currants with rum.  Super-sized oak portions with a long-lasting alcoholic malt finish.  Thinner than the standard Real Heavy from what I remember.  Worth waiting for.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"
667,"2010-06-07",4.1,"Draught. Nose is very sweet with lots of fruit and oak character. Cherries, strawberry, fig. Pours ruby with no head. Sweet and heavy, but still drinkable. Cherries, peaches, various citrus fruits, figs, oak, sherry, and caramel malt. All in good balance. Chewy, thick, alcoholic, but not overbearing.","Austin, Texas, USA","slimchill"

Smelling some wood, but not oak specifically. I almost hate to say it but I am pulling a cider quality here. Apple juice scents. Thick mouthfeel. Immediate alcohol flavor, wood, heavy fruit. Some dry malts near the end accompanied with a prompt alcohol burn. Stronger than actual taste. Wow.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"

Some very light oak tannins in the finish. Oak, brown sugar, raisins, vinous, tons of dark fruit, cherry, slightest hint of smoke. Brandy. Creamy carbonation.
