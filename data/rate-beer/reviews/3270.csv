3270,"2017-03-26",3.9,"Bottle from Bacchanalia, Cambridge. This is the first cloudwater beer i have genuinely liked, which is odd as it is not a style i have much love for. Pours cloudy orAnd with an off white head. Malt, yeast and caramel aroma. Bourbon is there, but subtle. Two things stick out; first, combination was pretty soft and not the fizzy nightmare you often get with the style. Second, there is some sweetness, but it is quite subtle and tinged with bourbon vanilla, i.e. not that in your face bubblegum sweetness you get from some more traditional versions. Viscous, oily texture with some nice bitterness. Really good stuff.","Belfast, NORTHERN IRELAND","LRonCupboard"

Aroma has a definite, lightly toasted coconut vibe. Quite Sorachi-like. Herbal. Lemon. Pineapple is there too. Toffee fudge. A touch of wood and booze but not too hot.

Smooth and beautifully full mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Fruity, bitter and warming finish. Interesting. One to savour.","Aberdour, SCOTLAND","JackMandarin"

3270,"2016-11-27",4.0,"Bottle sample @ Vine Birre Ribelli 16. And Clouwater strikes again, phenomenal.
Dorée, col blanc.
Arôme intense mais offrant un savant alliage entre le bouquet belge, qui se note via la levure, et le Bourbon qui apporte de fines effluves de vanille en rétro. Retrouve un houblonné plutôt noble dans le fleuri et léger citronné.
Palais est plaisant et complexe, le tout offre assez de caractère du Bourbon tout en gardant la base belge dune triple bien maitrisée. Lusage de chêne américain offre aussi cette pointe de douceur avec une petite pointe de sucre résiduel tirant vers le style abbaye belge. Lamertume reste plus en retrait.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
