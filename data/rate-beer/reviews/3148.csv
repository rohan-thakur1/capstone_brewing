Looks like a great NE style IPA. Smells fruity, peachy sweet with a nice apricot dry finish. Acidic and smooth nose. Tastes fruity. Strong peach and apricot.

3148,"2017-03-13",4.2,"Draught at EBF, 2/3/17.Hazy, pale-golden with some deeper bronze hues and a beige/yellow-flecked, off-white head showing strong retention for the style.Juicy and yet tart/acidic stone fruits in the nose are backed by a pinch of acetic acid, moderate oak and beautifully expressive Brett and lactic acid. Vanillla, honey and biscuit emanate from the malts, balancing somewhat, while horsey Brett deepens the funk and juicy peach lingers on the finish. No alcohol or flaw.Dry and yet quite malty in the mouth with tight, champagne-like carbonation and tons of lactic acid mixing with light acetic acid and strong oak tones. A slick-to-malty texture with infinitely juicy stone fruits providing fuzzy, skin-like flavors and acids along with tart and fruity Brett adding more complex fruits to the mix. Sour and inviting, with a lip-smacking finish, good dryness and no alcohol or flaw whatsoever.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
