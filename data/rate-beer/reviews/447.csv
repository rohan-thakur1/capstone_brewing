447,"2011-04-16",2.3,"Bottle. A clear, almost colorless sake. Rice cooking water and alcohol dominates the aroma, with some fruityness. The flavor is a bit heavy on the alcohol and rice, but theres some fruityness too. Yellow apples and pears too. Warming and full-bodied. A bit too warming and ricey for my likings, but its far from bad eventhough. 110416","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
