1201,"2016-01-24",5.0,"This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a hazy almost burnt orange color with a one finger white head that dissipated immediately. Lacing spider webbed and became spotty.
The smell started off with sweet onion, subtle sweet grassy, sticky citrus leads into a light grapefruit portion blending wonderfully. Light mango and resinous pine slides in underneath.
The taste was more bitter than sweet, but the sweetness does come out in the warming of the beer. Dry floral quality adds to the quality of this beer. Light citrus smooth aftertaste runs into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with more of a sipping quality to it. Carbonation runs at a nice pace along my tongue allowing the bitterness to hit just all around really spectacular.

1201,"2014-07-31",5.0,"Triple Sunshine
Lawson's finest liquid
Double/triple ipa 
10.5% ABV 

APPEARANCE: Pours a hazy over ripe tangerine fruit color, with bright 24k gold sparkling highlights. Has a beautiful loose, billowy off white head that sticks around for the long term with some super retention. 

AROMA: Fresh squeezed tropical fruit juice that has spilled into a damp jungle floor. Pineapple, mango, guava peel. Some very interesting earthy, minty notes that get rounded out by sweet bready, doughy malts. 

TASTE: Wow! Juicy mango burst right away. Followed by sweet ripe pineapple and peaches. Huge dank, wet earthy flavors that give way to a very layered hop profile. The malty sweetness on the nose comes into play only to give way to the crashing bitterness that hits on the backend. I can't believe this is 10.5% absolutely no heat and so easy to drink. 

MOUTHFEEL: Medium body, medium prickly carbonation. Lovely expansive creaminess that coats the whole mouth before retracting super quick with the dry snappy finish. 

OVERALL: I received this a few months after release it had been properly cellared. I honestly can't imagine how good this must have been fresh. This has blown my mind. This may be the best double/triple ipa I've had to date. So balanced but full of explosive flavors at the same time. I super confident in my rating of this truly masterful work of art!

RATING: 5/5 Zombie Heads!

1201,"2014-06-22",4.5,"Bottle: Thanks, Ed. And Tim, for my own bottle. Thick, opaque, radiant yellow-amber body with a soapy, stark white film & chunky collar on top. Mind numbing aroma of wet, fruity hops, mango, pineapple, hop oil, passion fruit, guava, tangerine... Good god. Mild sweetness underneath. So damn juicy. Taste is the same - juicy as fuck with a dextrose-esque sweetness similar to that of Abrasive or Ephraim. Pineapple, guava, mango, passion fruit - everything in the aroma translates. Lightly bitter hop bite, some dripping pine & hop oil. Perfect sweetness, orange & sugar cookie in the finish. A hint of alcohol but nowhere near 10.5% ABV. Moderately sticky. This is a world-class, fantastic DIPA. Better than Double Sunshine... its close. If anything, I will have to give the edge to Double Sunshine due to the slightly higher presence of pine that I enjoy, as well as a cleaner, more dry finish.

1201,"2014-05-26",4.3,"22 oz bottle served in a Lawsons Willi.

Pours a hazed, dark golden apricot with a thick, fluffy off white head. Long lasting retention and thick sheets of lace. Intensely tropical, leafy, green oily hoppy nose. First few sips is still a bit of a chore, particularly on finish with an immediate, strong boozy warming in the gullet. Not quite a burn, and not surprising for the style, but still an obvious reminder this isnt just a fresh batch of Double Sunshine. Otherwise, the flavor does follow most of what I love about Double Sunshine, with an additional Sunshine thrown in the mix. Body is still a little lighter and crisper than some other ""triple"" IPAs like Ephraim or Younger. Flavor is all hops, sweet and sugary up front, pineapple and mango, before a drier, pleasantly bitter finish with a hint of spice and grass. Bottle was a much better experience than cask (previous review below). In small doses this amazing, but over the course of the bottle I miss the relative ""balance"" and ""subtlety"" of Double Sunshine, particularly with regards to the booziness. 

Original Review...

Served on cask at Mad Taco in a small orange juice glass. 

Pours a hazy golden orange color with a thick ring of large cream colored bubbles. Nose is dominated by tropical fruit juice with a light alcohol punch. Not much malt presence or bitterness in flavor, just waves of tropical fruit sweeteness, guava, pineapple, orange, grapefruit, etc. Cask treatment isnt doing many favors for the complexity of this beer and there is a ridiculous amount of alcohol heat that builds up in the finish, ravaging your throat. Will revisit review from a bottle, but on cask MOAR SUNSHINE did not improve on the at times perfect Double Sunshine.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","yourefragile"
