1278,"2015-07-22",3.7,"This beer pours a copper color with a small ring around the top. The nose is citrusy hops, so much so its IPA like the moderate caramel malty backbone shows up after it warms. The flavor is pretty spot on with that nose, with the hops showing at first but then the bready caramel malts take over. Everything is pretty mellow, smooth with a touch of bitterness.

Red-amber; clear; very good tan head; excellent lacing.

1278,"2014-02-06",3.9,"Welcome back, old friend! It has been far too long.

An amazing clear deep copper produces a long lasting off white head that leaves behind beautiful lacing.... One of the prettiest beers ever.

Nose is big floral hops with some light grassy hoppiness... plenty of dry toast/dry caramel maltiness that helps balance but never smells sweet... perhaps a light fruity ester, but that could be in my imagination.

Flavor is very well balanced... dark caramel presence meshes well with the floral hops and some background earthy hoppiness.. significantly more bitterness lets you know this is of PNW origin and gives a nod to the Continental ESBs... With warmth a light nutty element arises and adds to the complexities.

Smooth with a light carbonation.

1278,"2007-09-15",3.7,"Bottle Code of A082007, Sampled September 2007
Pours with a brilliantly clear, deep, ruby-red color and is topped by a frothy, initially three-finger thick, amber-tinged, tan colored head that leaves some lacing on the sides of the glass as it slowly recedes.  The beer has an interesting aroma of strawberries that I notice as I am pouring this brew into my tulip glass.  Closer inspection of the aroma makes out that fruity note to be hop derived, though it seems more like a combination of candied citrus peel and berries than of the initial strawberry note.  A herbal / pine like hoppiness is also here, and at time is fairly noticeable.  This really has an enticingly hoppy nose to it; I am quite enjoying it.  Sweet, caramelized malt sugar notes and toasty grain aromatics form a backdrop to the up front, more dominant hop character.

A slightly creamy mouthfeel, that has a touch of fizziness from the carbonation.  The beer is quite quaffable, fairly light, yet substantial enough to be noticed as it sits in the mouth.  The beer finishes with a solid bitterness as well as a menthol like herbal flavor, both of which contribute to a lingering astringency on the tongue.  The beer is only lightly sweet (though I had a lemonade recently so take that for what it is), but has a rich caramelized grain character.  There also seems to be a touch of toasted malt, almost even chocolate character here; this is fairly subtle, but adds a nice, extra dimension to the malt.  The hops and malt combine to give this beer a nice fruitiness that reminds me of oranges, berries and maybe even raisins.

This is quite a nice beer; it is very quaffable and I would definitely be happy drinking quite a few pints of these (before I know it, my 12oz pour is gone).  I really like the hop character here and how it combines with the substantial, yet secondary, malt character.

1278,"2007-08-12",3.5,"8/12/2007:  Alaskan ESB produces a nice pour.  It is a beautiful, clear rich honey/amber-orange color with a lasting, frothy beige head.

This really doesnt seem like a pleasant blend, especially when repeated nosing yields a burned caramel character that starts to overtake what awkward hop profile already made its case to the court. The flavor is a bit more pleasing but its also rather muddled. Bitterness is moderate, sweetness is as well. Astringency grows steadily. There are some nice cake icing notes that develop after each sip. Finishes mildly bitter, fading to caramel, weird and vegetal.

Smell: The aroma is toasty and malty with hints of caramel. The hops are very reserved but present as a light grassy attribute. There is also a hint of diacytel in the nose along with a slight smell of egg whites.

Taste: This is a very balanced beer with a nice toasty caramel malt flavor. There seemed to be hints of dough early in the flavor. There is a nice light hint of fruit along side a very bready body. As it warms the diacytel and a tea like character showed up more. I got distracted with my babies waking each other up and it did get a bit too warmed in the mid of my tasting. However, I was very pleased with the beer and found it to be very easy drinking. The orange-ish hops showed up more in the finish and the aftertaste. 

Mouthfeel: Magnificently smooth mouthfeel that is near perfect except the medium body goes a bit limp through the center. Still, very creamy and quaffable.

Drinkability: Simply put, this beer is irresistible! Simple and yet elegant in that simplicity; this is a very well crafted drinking beer!

Lacing is scattered, but plentiful.  ESBs tend to be a more subtle and perhaps refined, if I can use that word, but this one is very bold.  This is a much darker roasted beer than most ESBs, and just packed with flavor, and maybe thats why Im liking this so much.  Good stuff.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Limited aroma but a nice drinkable bitters; amply hopped with a pleasant if relatively straightforward flavor and finish.

Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation, moderately astringent.

Its a bit abrasive in the mouth, being fairly citric and astringent, and the hops arent really my style (not all bad, but a little too green/resinous for me).  But it does have a pretty good malt presence too.  Good.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

It has a fullness, not watery and is quite nicely dry...no sweet aftertastes that I dont like.  One of my Alaskan favorites.

A fresh-crushed caramel malt and a yeasty fruitiness with a touch of acrid (good) black malt complete the rest of the complex aroma.  Red/ orange in color with a light tan head that dissipates quickly.  Flavor is nicely balanced between a light caramel maltiness and pungent, sweet hops, though the overall impression is that the beer is quite dry.  Nicely bitter and malty at the same time.

1278,"2001-09-30",3.9,"Chewy malts, earthen flavors and a bitter bite at the end.  The best American ESB that Ive had, and the star of the local beer festival I attended.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
1278,"2001-08-22",3.8,"Decent ESB. Nice looking. Loads of caramel malts with a subtle mix of earthy hoppiness and some Cascade notes as well. Very crisp yet sweet and drinkable.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"
1278,"2001-08-11",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2007 I though this was very fresh and tasty.  My mom brought some back from Oregon along with their others offerings.  I found it rich in malts and hops in the aroma and semi-chewy with good body and decent head after a hard poor.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1278,"2001-07-28",4.3,"Caramel malt nose and flavour with some hop bitterness to balance.  This is one of the top US ESBs that I have tried.","San Diego, California, USA","Kaya161"

1278,"2000-11-22",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2003 The color on the pour is a limpid burnished copper, the head modest, frothy and the color a light beige with the lace a fine covering sheet. Nose is floral, buttery, crisp and clean, a real sniffer with the start sweet and full of malt, top is middling in feel. Finish has a delectable hop presence, acidity moderate and the aftertaste quite dry, and a real credit to the style.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
