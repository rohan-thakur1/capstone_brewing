466,"2015-08-04",3.7,"Draught @ WarPigs. Pours blackish dark brown with a small creamy mocha head that leaves a small trace on the glass while dissipating. Smell is malty and roasty with roasted malts, sweet dark bread, heavy espresso coffee, bitter cocoa powder, liquorice fudge, moist soil and minerals. Taste is sweet, bitter, malty and roasty. Mouthfeel is soft, round, slightly velvety, tiny roasted astringent and medium bodied. Finish is slightly sweet and bitter with roasted malts, dark bread, espresso coffee, cocoa powder and moist soil. Insane coffee character packed with high quality espresso beans. Gets a bit plain though with that same great coffee knocking out most of the other components of the beer and hides the malts and roast. Tasty but needs some balance.","G√∂teborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"
