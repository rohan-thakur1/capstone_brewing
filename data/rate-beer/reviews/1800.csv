Bottled 12/18/2012.
Brune foncée, col crémeux café au lait et doré au verre.
Arôme offre un bouquet épais au niveau malté, retrouve as mal de chocolat, le tout gardant un léger rétro fruité noir/rouge.
Palais est maté également assez épais, caramel dont les 10% se font bien sentir. Le tout reste sec, petite touche rappelant le tourbé et une fin de bouche réchauffante. Pas grand chose en terme houblonné amertume mais un côté fruité noir indique que lon est bien dans un style baltique.

1800,"2014-07-01",3.9,"Reviewed from notes. This was received in a trade.
This was poured into a nonic pint glass and a snifter.
There wasnt any difference between the two glasses.
The appearance was a fairly decent dark brown to black color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute gracing the glass with some fairly nice clinging lacing in a spider web fashion.
The smell had a good about of licorice, light coffee, light milk chocolate with some booziness swirling around together underneath my nose.
The taste was sweet and boozy around the chocolate, coffee and alcohol. There was a light sticky boozy chocolate aftertaste and a dry coffee/chocolatey finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with more of a sippers type of quality to it. The carbonation seemed fairly light, but thats okay, its nothing that was bad.
Overall, what a nice Baltic Porter I would have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

T: A ton of roasted malts, some char and a touch of cocoa bean. Bitter dark chocolate with some light fruity yeast in the background. Definitely seems like an amped up Baltic porter due to the yeast strain. Enjoyable.

M: Low carbonation. Silky smooth across the palate. Medium bodied. Finish is chocolate and big roast.

O: This a big and roasty beer, but the yeast strain drops subtle hints that its still got some Baltic porter bloodlines at heart. Its pretty ready to go now with the booze well hidden. Dont really see this benefiting from any extended aging. Maybe a year if you want the robust roasted malts to die down a bit.
