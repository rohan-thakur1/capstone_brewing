3495,"2016-11-10",3.7,"Piana dość obfita, drobna i średnia, utrzymuje się w postaci mięsistej chmurki. Barwa bursztynowa, mętna. W aromacie przyjemny karmel połączony z kandyzowanymi owocami i jasnym, dojrzałym winogronem, delikatne zioła. W smaku półwytrawne, choć posmak wydaje się słodki, w typie syropu klonowego, akacji, cukru kandyzowanego. Goryczka niska, ziołowo pikantna, głogowy aftertejs, niewielkie wysycenie, bardzo pijalne i lekkie (nie wodniste) w odbiorze.

Ciekawe piwo, brytyjska alternatywa dla amerykańskich APA czy niemieckich pilsów Fajne.","Kalisz, POLAND","alteregoo"
3495,"2016-08-01",3.6,"29th July 2016Hazy amber beer, good cream colour head. Palate is light and semi dry, modest fine carbonation. Light malts, nice caramel, and modest creamy sweetness. Tangy dried fruits. Touches of sweet floralness and marmalade. Light finish brings a pretty mild bitterness. There is a definite olde worlde feel and charm about this beer. Very drinkable.",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"

3495,"2016-06-15",4.2,"Bottle at home in London - picked up at the brewery. Pours totally clear orange-gold, lightly effervescent, with a thick, frothy off-white head; looks excellent. Theres a bit of English yeast in the nose, some bready malts, light toffee, subtle toasted honey, a whisper of citrus. Medium sweet flavour with rather delicious creamy toffee character, mellow bitter toasted hay, biscuits, faint leaves, some sun-kissed pale malts. Light bodied with rich, massaging carbonation that echoes nicely the creaminess in the flavour. Well balanced on the finsh, with further pronounced bready malt character, nips of butterscotch and toffee, soft bitterness, a dash of vanilla. Well, this is some delicious stuff. Supremely well balanced, and massively drinkable.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

Lovely mouthfeel. Wow, I have to say that is lovely. I could drink that all day. I love the malty biscuit. Delicious.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

Tastes similar, quite rich, malty, caramel, fruity, slightly bitter with a hint of sweetness in there too. Decent beer but the score would have been much higher if wasnt served so warm. CPK should know better.","Northwood, Greater London, ENGLAND","evergreen0199"
