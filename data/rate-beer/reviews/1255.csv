1255,"2017-04-28",4.0,"0.65l bottle shared with The Tasting Crew. Only my cat like reflexes saved this from fountain ingen over the table. No gusher, but wants out and it has a massive really good looking near fluffy everlasting off-white head. All this on top of a cloudy deep orangey warm body. Looks nice and smells really nice as well. Lots of malty and fruity nuances. Hard to describe this aroma. Its almost yeast nutty with a rush of red berries and sweet melon. Yeah, wish every enn could smell like this. This is tasty. Super car smelly and somewhat sweet all this without being too much. Its spot on the carbonation and it has a fantastic feeling in the mouth as well. Lots of ripe fruity touches with minerally rocks and earth. There is lots of wet rocks and even a little bit of spicy licorice here. So much flavor! My expectations were quite low before popping the cap on this, but wow. This is one amazing esb. 23.10.2013","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"
1255,"2016-08-31",3.6,"Deep, super hazy brown and toffee coloured body with a great, three centimetre tall light brown head that looks nice and tops the beer even better. Aroma of toasted malt, toffee, earth, grain, rye, german/english hops and a bit of alcohol - rather pungent in the nose. Medium-bodied; Very earthy and toffee-y flavours up front with a lot of toasted malt, grain, rye and english hops with some sugars and a lot of alcohol noticeable. Aftertaste shows the grain and earth more than anything else, but the lighter alpha acid hops show through along with the earthy sugars and a touch of fruit. Overall, a decent ESB with some good qualities, but nothing too impressive or out of the ordinary. Definitely not a must-have beer or worth spending a lot on - but nice to finally sample.

1255,"2016-01-22",3.7,"BOD 9/24/15. Clear amber pour with a slight garnet cast. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

Rather light but nice nose of citrus (orange), a touch of spruce spiciness, tea and grainy biscuit with a bit of caramel.

Light medium body that is smooth with a touch of oiliness. Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a stronger burst in the finish.

Quite nice flavor profile, but not quite up to snuff compared to the outstanding classic English bitters, such as Fullers (which is world class). Hop flavors present are predominately tea, whilst light citrus floats around a bit. The rich heavily caramel background is a bit out of balance lending the bitterness to not cut and slash in a sharp crisp fashion characteristic of the style. Do a side by side with Fullers ESB and youll taste what Im saying. The middle bitterness is a bit muted for the style and does add apricot flavor, as advertised. The finish is a slow sweet fade. This beer is quite nice and very flavorful. As a pale ale I would score it outstanding, but as an ESB - it misses the mark.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

1255,"2015-12-26",3.7,"22 oz bottle shared by ebone1988. The pour is a deep ruby mahogany color
With a nice off white head that fades to a film and thicker collar, leaving some good lace behind. The aroma is very fruity. There is a lot of apricot and juiciness to accompany a lightly bitter malt on the back end. It's not really the bitter I was expecting, but it's different... Kind of like everything Three Floyds does. Not necessarily a good thing. The flavor is interesting. There is a little bittering to the malt that happens on the back end that reminds me of an unsweetened tea. It's got a decent flavor and a light bittering to it. It's sweet up front and then slowly over through a lightly bitter finish. It's not bad. Not that great. The mouth feel is a little viscous and lightly carbonated with a lingering sweet malt backed up by a light bitter.

In long: Nose is bursting with fresh leafy hops over fresh cookies.  Taste has a lot of cookies, toasted crusty bread, smooth caramel and of course lots and lots of fresh leafy hops that sometimes get into citrusy territory.  The bitterness is of medium intensity and the finish is clean and a bit dry.  A beer to be consumed uber-fresh.  This beer is especially fun because uber-hoppy beers rarely have that hop bill.  Im sure there were American hops also in there but overall it felt different than most American IPAs.  A bit reminiscent of a lower gravity version of Three Floyds own BlackHeart.

...my backbone is shot through. 

A bright fulvous beer, the color of Horatio Nelsons badges Im sure, with a somewhat disappointing half-finger head and lacing.

I came into this one blind, and Ill leave it blind, but the nose is full of an overwhelming array tropical fruit hoppiness. I dont know the style well, but this particular beer is strong and bitter, as the style suggests. A sharp mango, citrusy hoppiness meets with a minor bready malt backbone. Grapefruit rind, resin, orange. 

Creamy, but a bit thin, though highly drinkable. I drink a third of the Admiral, wonder if I can finish the glass after a few other FFF beers, and all of a sudden, Nelson is dead. He is gone, but he has gone bravely. Unsurprisingly, this is an excellent beer.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"

Poured a dark copper with a nice creamy head, although not as much as is normal for the style. The nose is definitely dominated by some great citrus hops atop semi-sweet caramel malt. The taste was very similar to an IPA, but with a decidedly English influence, though still different from an English IPA. Medium body with good carbonation, the drinkability on this was excellent, and Im really looking forward to being able to try the bottled edition.

That version is very enjoyable, but twice it has not been.  Once from the tap and once from a bottle it has had a slighty offensive grassy aroma and more pronounced grassy taste.

Strong juicy citrus, piny tangerine and other tropical fruity quaffs. Hop perfume. Not sure if that is point-worthy anymore. Caramel. Some slight hints of English malt. [A] Pours clear orangish-yellow. The head on the first 1/2 was truly beautiful. Capped until the bottom of the glass. Off-white frothy foam. Excellent retention. Few soapy bubbles. Bottle art kicks ass. [F] - Mouth hits with a strong dose of hops. Mid-body is caramel. Very light bready malt. Fruity with a bitter linger. Not very much depth. Not very ""English"" to me, either. [P] Bottle served close to cask temperature. Mouth is very thin & hoppy with tingly carbonation. Drinkable. Soft feel, but sharp bite. Not boozy, but astringent enough that you never forget youre drinking a beer. Highly drinkable in the long run. Cask does sound delicious. [O] 55 IBUs come off a bit stronger than posted. Good thing? I must say I am a tad disappointed in this for some reason. But blindly, it was a nice 3F brew. Bitter where it should be, I guess. Just more normal than ""not normal"" for me.

1255,"2010-03-03",4.1,"Bomber.  Pours mostly clear, with a dark reddish-amber hue.  A massive column of rocky, ivory tinted froth is excellently retained, and it leaves thick, sticky sheets and splotches of lacing all over the glass.  Distinctly Brittish in composition, with loads of caramelized biscuit and fresh, doughy bread notes, the aroma applies the signature Three Floyds approach in monstrous hopping, showing loads of fresh, juicy grapefruit, bright lemon peel, and peppery grass.  The flavor is just as well constructed, again showing luscious caramel, biscuit, and spiced bread malts that are countered with zesty, bitter grasses and bright grapefruit.  Delicious stuff!  The palate also strikes excellent balance, carrying enough heft and creaminess to satiate the mouth, yet somehow remaining delicate enough to pose as a session brew.  Carbonation is fine and moderate, while the finish shows on the drying side. I could drink this stuff every day and be perfectly happy.  Great beer!

Taste is floral, perfumed, resin and pine, hops outpacing the malt.  Malty and dense with an extremely sticky medium body.  Light caramel and lighter earth, some juicy citrus and balanced dry bitterness.  Alcohol well-hidden, just a touch of structure without the taste or warmth.  Intense flavor, too much for a session beer, and no trace of its English origins (an American original, as they say - basically a sticky APA with some Fuggles).

Medium body, watery texture that turns slightly chewy in the finish, moderate carbonation that is slightly raspy in the aftertaste. Bright, juicy hop taste is long lasting, but the beer is not overly bitter. The nice caramel profile of classic English ESBs is missing here, pretty much run over by the hops.

1255,"2010-02-02",3.8,"Bottle. Pours a clear dark amber with a thick white head that lasts and laces quite nicely. Aroma has notes of resin and pine with a bit of an undertone of grains. The hops give a nice bitter pine flavor with an undertone of smooth grains and cereal. Strong beer.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
1255,"2010-02-01",4.0,"22oz bottle.  Pours a clear glowing rich bright amber with a nice dense white froth.  Aroma of amarillo, hint of banana, very fresh and nicely balanced.  Strong juicy hop flavor, citrus, tea bitterness, malt flour, long lasting bitter finish/aftertaste, touch of banana/bubble-gum, hint of nuttiness, medium/strong sweet, a nice hybrid.  Medium bodied, chalky on the finish, malt flour, great ESB aftertaste.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"
1255,"2010-01-31",3.9,"Huge head sits atop a clear,light,amber beer. Potent floral,fruity,hop aromas pretty much dominate the underlying malty aromas,which in this case isnt a bad thing. Little caramel,bread. Medium texture,and body. Very smooth,and clean. Upfront bready,caramel,malt flavors are overpowered by the floral,pine,hops. Hops just sit on the tounge. FInish is more florals,and tropical fruit lingering with bready malts. Very clean,tasty, and more fresh than anything Ive had from them in some time.This is not a European style ESB,but I do like.","Evansville, Indiana, USA","raindog"
1255,"2010-01-29",3.8,"Bottle by way of StFun  thanks again Josh!  Pours a highly carbonated amber with a 2 finger foamy off-white head that leaves coating lacing.  The nose is fresh citrus, malt and pine.  The taste is apricots, citrus, caramel malt and a light grapefruity finish.  Medium mouthfeel.  Highly drinkable stuff  thanks Big J!","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","Sparky"
1255,"2010-01-28",3.6,"First bottling, picked up at Kahns. Pours crystal clear amber/brown with minimal white head. Nose is FFF hops with citrus/grapefruit going on. Flavor is sharp, dry, bitter, characteristic of ESB but with a nicely balanced twist of lemon, peach, mango hops.  Definitely not my favorite style by far, but MAJOR kudos to FFF for making this drinkable through the use of their trademark hopping style.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","awiseman01"
1255,"2010-01-23",3.7,"I like bitter!  Nice brew - I dont have enough experience rating ESBs as a style, but this seemed much like an American IPA. Piney and citrus nose and flavor. I did pick up notes of caramel. Great hop flavor. Nice caramel color and good frothy head with lacing. This is a very drinkable, enjoyable beer.","Indiana, USA","BigBang"
1255,"2010-01-22",3.8,"Bottle.  Pour is clear deep brown with a beige head.  Aroma is resin and pine hops with rich caramel malt and a lightly metallic aroma.  Flavor is resin and citrus hops with a caramel malt backbone.  Its tasty and well balanced.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"
1255,"2009-12-22",3.2,"StLHops tasting.  Whiskey appearance.  Not a big aroma but hops are prominent along with some fruit.  Flavor is huge biting hops that are incredibly intense.  The beer warms and brings some caramel and grapes.  Also some very welcome smoothness.  Hop heads will love this one but it was too intense for my tastes.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
1255,"2009-12-09",3.5,"aroma of strong pine, flavor is dry with grapefruit, pine and resin.  deep amber piour with reducing head and great lacing.  ultra drinkable beer that provides my hop fix but far too brash to be any kind of ESB, good or bad.","River Grove, Illinois, USA","satan165"
1255,"2008-11-02",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2010 11/2/2008: Pint at the brew pub. Really great, creamy bitter aroma. Flavor is pretty great: lots of great bitter hops balances with the caramel malts. Mouthfeel was creamy, and, overall, this is an excellent ESB.

Re-rate: 1/23/10.  22 oz bottle from the brewery.  This is a stoundout ESB.  The head stays atop this thing forever.  Cookie dough malts mixed with flavorful hops.  Perfect creamy texture.  Bumped it up a couple points.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
1255,"2008-10-29",3.6,"This version seemed like a cross between an ESB and an American IPA. The aroma is very citusy, though the yeast gives the beer a smoother palate than an IPA. All around it’s a pretty good beer, just not what I expect from an ESB.","highland, Indiana, USA","inkubus27"
1255,"2008-10-22",3.8,"Imperial Pint on tap at the Brewpub. 6 Words: One of the Best ESBs Ever. Maybe its the super floral bouquet, or maybe the abundance of hops. But this brew nearly tops all other ESBs Ive had. The malt bill is a little light, therefore the balance doesnt necessarily win points, but how can you pour enough malty sweetness into a brew with such a deep, abiding hoppiness. Maybe it is the IPA fan in me, but this one and the Brutal are neck and neck, and are both extremely different. Dark amber body with a decent offwhite / tannish head. Aromas are a wonderous floral bouquet coupled with a lighter malty sweetness. The hoppy nose steals the show with this beer. Head laces well. Taste is similar, large hoppiness up front, moving to a small malt bill sweetness, moving again to a bitter, but smooth finish. Remarkable. Cheers!","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
1255,"2007-11-06",3.1,"A nice ESB.  For me the ESB standard is Anvil, but this was even slightly smoother.  The expected downside was an absence of the characteristic caramel notes, but pleasant nonetheless.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"
1255,"2007-10-02",3.3,"On tap @ 3F for Andrews Bachelor Party.  Pours orange with a clear beige head.  Light hops and carmel in the nose.  Orange citrus with a light sweet creaminess.  Some spicy/noble hops from underneath the malt.  Tasty for the style.  I dont think it deserved first at NotLA, but Im happy to try it again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"
1255,"2007-08-29",3.7,"Tap at Spuyten Duyvil.  Deep amber with a thick off-white head that lasts and lasts.  Great fresh tangerine citrus notes right away but there is also a lovely earthy, crackery UK-type maltiness in back.  Bread crust and light caramel.  While the hops are the first thing that you notice with this beer, the attention to the malts really sell it.  There is lots of hop aroma and flavour, but the bitterness is quite restrained.  Soft caramel integrates nicely with the sweet malts.  Earthy hop finish in spite of all of the citrus up front.  One of the first US-style bitters Ive had that really lives up the character of the style.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1255,"2007-08-25",3.4,"Rather dark amber pour...releasing a pretty potent aroma of American hops... pine resiny and a bit catty.  big caramely/biscuity maltiness to sweeten it up. This is very sessionable.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"
1255,"2007-07-30",3.6,"On tap at 3F during RBSG Road Trip 2007. Slightly hazy brown with an off white head. Nice lace. Very citrusy nose, somewhat tannic. Flavor more relaxed, citrusy but with a nutty malt balance.","Virginia Beach, USA","Immy"
1255,"2007-07-16",3.8,"On tap at the brewpub.  Red-brown with small white head.  Piney, grain aroma.  Pine, sweet substantial malt, and cherry flavor. Full-med body.  Very nice ESB.","Grand Rapids/Chicago, Michigan, USA","xnoxhatex"
1255,"2007-07-07",3.4,"Tap at brewery: Rich coppery hue with golden highlight, small lasting head and okay lace. The aroma has notes of pale and biscuity malt, floral grassy and slightly piney hops,  light citric notes, and an earthy quality to the nose. The taste starts mildly malty before a rush of hop bitterness comes forth. Sort of a hybrid with equal part classic hop and an Americanized piney overtone. Even a bit nutty at some point. Finished with some metallic notes and mostly dry on the aftertaste. An easy drinker but larger than a normal session brew. Not your standard ESB, more akin to an APA, tasty never the less.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
1255,"2007-07-01",3.8,"On tap at the brewpub. Slightly hazy copper body with a large creamy off-white head. Strong sweet citrus hops aroma with a tea-like maltiness in the background.

Grapefruit hops and toffee flavours. Hoppy but not a Fullers ESB. Hops push back the malts.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
1255,"2007-05-23",3.5,"Draught.  At the brewpub.  Dropped in on my way to Chicago.  Poured hazy amber with a decent head.  Aroma is a little up-front hoppy for an ESB, but green and nicely pungent - a little sweet, nicely herbal - had fresh euro pils character.  Nice malt/light funk fresh hop flavour, nice, reminds me a lot of their ""mild"" ale - very drinkable.  Average body, good carbonation, lightly bitter - very good!","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

1255,"2007-04-02",3.8,"On tap at 3F.  Poured a clear, deeper amber with 1"" of creamy off-white head.. sticky lacing followed it down.  The aroma found soft caramel with heavy floral hoppage.. some pineapple too.. sweet and alluring.  Flavor was of a hella-hopped bitter... soft caramel, toffee, and light fruity sweetness (peach, pineapple, and mango) base with a juicy bitterness surrounding... lingering floral and fruity bitterness at the finish.  Medium-bodied.. smooth, sweeter base was well-balanced with all the bitterness around it.  Good stuff!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

1255,"2007-03-17",3.9,"Imperial pint draft at Floyds. British? Hah! Despite assurances its got all British ale hops, its still at the usual 3Fs strength: a rush of lime, pineapple, pine tree and cat box. A lovely brown English beer color, though, just a bit hazy with a light scrum of foam. Hop hit is cheek by jowl to a hearty English malt bill, sweet and chewy as a fresh baked cookie. Nelsons body could have preferred to be shipped home in a barrel of this, instead of French brandy!""Kiss me, Hardy!""","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

1255,"2007-03-09",3.7,"Theres a noticable viscosity to a light-hazed amber body under a sudsy head. Sharp, peppery grapefruit in the nose with a touch of dishwater if I inhale too deeply. An IPA with that English tilt, hops get balanced but still shine with a strong peppery punch. An award winner tonight, and deservedly so.

Obviously different enough and well made enough to be the peoples favorite.  It had a tremendous hop smell.  The taste was pure grapefruit.  If you want that in a beer, this is for you.  Nice enough to sample but not one that Id drink a whole lot of...and Im a 3 Floyds fan.","USA","locarboy"
