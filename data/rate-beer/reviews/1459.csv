1459,"2017-04-01",3.1,"DOB: ?2015 BJCP Category: 33B Specialty Wood-Aged Beer (base style: 20A American Porter)
AROMA: Intense vanilla and sugary sweetness. Strong bourbon and wood character from the barrel. Very sweet nose with sight cinnamon-like spicy presence. Plenty of dark malt. No distinct hops. 8/12APPEARANCE: Inky opaque black. Small dark tan foam retains well for the ABV. 2/3FLAVOR: Highly sweet vanilla is the dominate flavor with chocolate and coconut emerging briefly. There is gentle bitterness and a slight cinnamon-like spice (but no hop flavor per se). Bourbon and wood flavors are consistently in the background along with a strong boozy taste and warmth. Finishes with a cherry cough syrup or Dr. Pepper flavor that lingers momentarily. Hard to discern any specialty or roasted malt; just a general dark maltiness. Though tasty, it is cloying and unbalanced. 14/20MOUTHFEEL: Full-bodied with low carbonation. Smooth texture with alcohol heat that is difficult to ignore. The 15% ABV is impossible to overlook and makes the beer a sipper. Sugary/medicine-like aftertaste is tolerable. 2/5OVERALL IMPRESSION: Though enjoyable, its unapologetically unbalanced and cloying.

Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like coconut, chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, bourbon, nuts, and some coffee. Kinda reminds me of an Almond Joy bar. Mostly sweet but the barrel character isnt strong, Im guessing the overall sweetness of this beer just overpowers everything else.

Nose is coconut-heavy and fudgy, first and foremost. Some spicy brown sugar notes appear vibrantly, with very Mexican-chocolate notes and mocha essences. Actually an extremely dessert-like nose. Beautifully aromatic. The flavor boasts a noticeable hotness with very sweet cinnamon and brown sugar, definitely not a dry porter to say the least. The turninado, cinnamon, and vanilla from the oak add a profound dessert-like quality to this beer. With a fairly slick, full body and ephemeral carbonation, this brew is quite confusing. I cant tell whether I love or hate it. To say the least, its a ""dessert beer"". Spiced, sugary, oaked, a perfect after-dinner beer to lull you into a lovely fuzziness of a buzz.

Overall: this is way too sweet. Not a beer for diabetes! They would probably die after the first sip. I?m glad I had this beer as not being part of a session. I would probably have drained pour it for sure. But, as a second beer it?s ok. It?s a shame since I thought the flavor of this one was really good.

Overall: anyone who likes barrel aged stouts or porters, this is a must have. Its so good that I cannot say I have had anything better. It is sweet and a little boozy. You would not guess it at 15 abv though. When you love beer, this is one of the beers that life is made of.","rochester hills, Michigan, USA","libertine"

1459,"2015-12-04",3.6,"Bomber, assumedly recent, shared by WillRunforbeer on 11/28/15.Dark mahogany/ebony pour has a tan head that is small and shows moderate to low retention. Did not check clarity.Hugely rich, almost candy-sweet nose does not burn with alcohol, but seems quite estery. Coconut adds to the overall rich/sweet character and the turbinado fermentation adds more esters and candy character. Bourbon is notable, but not overdone, with prominent spice and vanilla emerging. Dosent smell as much like an Imperial Stout/Porter so much as it does a big huge barleywine. Kind of like an amped up JW Lees, or something like that (with bourbon and coconut).Rich, strong, sweet, candyish and estery/fruity in the mouth, it has a massively soft, sugary texture, though the alcohol prevents it from being syrupy or cloying. Difficult to rate, as its not ""overdone"" in the usual sense of an Imperial. The barrel aging is done pretty well, its not a booze bomb, especially given the massive abv and its not underfermented. But I just dont think theres quite enough dry/acidc balance to it (some tannin and heavy toasted oak lingers, but not exactly pleasantly). If youre putting a beer in a bourbon barrel, why are you also adding coconut? Furthermore, why the hell do you need to turbinado this thing up to 15% abv??? Jesus christ, isnt 12% way more than enough??","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1459,"2015-11-30",4.3,"Pours a night black color, with a surprisingly huge, bubbly mohagony head.

Smells of an earth supported, profound cinnamon spiciness, together with sweet, slightly wooden coconut, toasted pecans and a whiff of lemon peel. These aromas blend into burned toffee, tied together by bakers chocolate and raisins. Its sweet qualities turn quite distinct, topped off by molasses, which get balanced by a rich bourbon soaked appearance, adding vanilla and a warming punch to the nose.

Has a lower carbonation, with a luscious smoothness to it, showcasing the beers huge body beautifully, while finishing with a great blend of spicy, bourbon soaked truffles.

Mirrors the spicy truffle impression from the nose, while adding a fair amount of scorched malts and walnut shells to it. Its malt qualities are multi layered, very rich, to be able to balance the beers bourbon quality, revealing toffee, caramel and molasses, tied together by roasted coconut. Bourbon adds a flowery vanilla flavor, blending perfectly into the already established cinnamon woodeness, enriching the beer by a hot wood bark note, adding a pungent dryness to the sweetness. Finishes outstandingly smooth, with boozy, chocolate coated caramel and lots of whipped cream. 

Its smoothness balances the hot bourbon bite easily, while providing well fitting adjuncts, coming together due to a rich maltiness. While this is certainly a sipper, it reveals its huge abv only embedded in the warming, flowery Bourbon barrel.","GERMANY","aleigator"

The flavor shows a great myriad of flavors. Vanilla, cinnamon, oak and a nice melded bourbon. Damn the mouthfeel is awesome!! Oily with a mild bourbon burn.

A - The appearance is like an oily and slick black...not a thick mess but its really good looking. A nice dark tan head. 

S - This is a coconut bomb. I absolutely think it smells stupid good. table sugar, cinnamon, brown sugar, coconut and vanilla.

T - Thick, like a chocolate cake dessert with toasted coconut and a lot of bakers chocolate with a little bit of brown sugar at the finish. Loaded with flavor and vanilla...but for 15% beer, the booze isnt even present. Its just very refined.

1459,"2015-11-12",4.3,"On draft at HopCat in Ann Arbor. In prep for Rare Day tomorrow. The pour is a pitch black, oily and no head. There is a little wispy lace as it empties. The aroma is heavy booze. It's a bit to get past that. Lots of coconut and barrel influence on this one. The cinnamon comes through on the back end. It smells sweet. Almost like a syrup. Brown sugar and molasses is present in the back end. The flavor is good. The cinnamon really pops on the flavor. The coconut takes a back seat and it's a little more bracing and bitter than the scent leads on. The mouth feel is thin. It pours much thicker than it feels. There is a decent carbonation but it falls off the tongue and out of the mouth quickly. Aftertaste is lingeringly sweet cinnamon. Pretty good. Finally got to try it!
