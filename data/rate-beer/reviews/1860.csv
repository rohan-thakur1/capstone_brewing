1860,"2015-08-17",3.4,"On tap.
Very interesting. Certainly one of the most flavorful and complex lagers Ive had and, not coincidentally, about the only barrel aged one. Plenty of barrel aging impact but not so much so as to mask some of the underlying lager character.

Palate: medium body, light light bitter finish, average carbonation, slightly dry. Taste: sweet molasses to a slightly hoppy bitter finish; sweetness is slightly cloying.

1860,"2014-04-30",3.4,"750ml botlle: Pours a deep golden near amber hue with even a touch of ruby highlights near the edges, fading frothy head and good lace. The aroma has notes of caramel, biscuit, bread, herbal and grassy hops, a hint of pear and crabapple esters. A faint hint of white pepper and cornmeal as well. The taste is somewhat sweet but not overly so, light spicy bitterness and subdued fruit. Yep there is a slight veggie note as well but not anything to ruin the experience. The mouth feel is solid, a filling but overly heavy body, slight minerally finish. This is more like the common bock than the Hacker-Pschorr Hubertus Bock I had before it. I liked that one a bit more but this is more than drinkable, actually one of the better Grand Teton beers I have had in many years. Too bad it was bottled in January, I would have liked to seen this bottled less than 30 days ago.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

1860,"2014-04-13",4.1,"It pours a sparkling clear 24k gold with a large head of foam that shrinks slowly.

The nose has notes of sweet malt, grain, with some spicy notes that I guess are from the use of German hops. A bit of booze sneaks through as well.

I get a big burst of sweetness on the first sip followed by big bready notes. The spicy hops comes in with flavours of oranges, not blood oranges mind you ;^) but they add a nice dimension to what I think is a smooth drinking brew. The sweet notes also almost have a honey like quality to them. The bottled on date shows 21/14.

Like I said, this is a smooth drinker and smooth describes the mouthfeel as well. It feels really good in the old yack machine.

Well, overall, I really enjoy drinking this Maibock. Notice I said drinking; yes, Im still sipping as it does feel a bit stronger than the 7.8% abv that it is. Not a bad way to stretch out a session with a beer I like, eh?","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"
