1410,"2011-07-10",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 2, 2011 My Bottom Line :  
Subtly toasted and caramelized malts are seduced by wooden, earthy hops in this slender and perfectly harmonious Altbier. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A veil of foam draws lots of lacing atop the deep amber. 
-The fluffy natural carbonation and overall dryness make for great drinkability. 
-This is a great example of ingredients that can blend into one another seamlessly. 
-This feels a tad drier than Ueriges own wondrous Altbier. The malt profile may not have as much depth either. Nonetheless, I have to say Schlüssel makes a world-class Alt I would love to have access to in this form.

1410,"2011-01-05",3.9,"This one is a bit over the best before date but was quickly proven to be good nonetheless. 500 ml, BB 22.October 2010, into tulip. A vigorous pour creates deep amber to bronze body with good clarity, topped by thick firm off-white head with excellent retention that clings to the walls and, although slowly subsides, virtually never dies. The nose is rich malt with caramel and toasty notes, peppery spiciness that probably originates from noble hops, fruity esters of plum and raisins.
Flavor starts with prominent hoppy bitterness counterbalanced by crisp, well attenuated malt. Fruity esters are virtually absent, slightly nutty finish is quite dry allowing hoppy bitterness to persist into the aftertaste. Medium bodied, soft carbonated with slight astringency.

In short: a sessional lagered ale with assertive hoppy bitterness and a good dosage of attenuated malt.","SLOVENIA","EvilBuddha"

The palate, crispy as hell with a tickeling feeling and very little carbonation.

I guess this is the very best place to have this beer, where you can have it and drink it within minuttes of the pour - it still have the freshness and crispyness that make these beers so good. I guess that you loose alot of that in the bottled versions.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","lassem"

Gently bready to calm the game. Fresh make that Fresh again so the message comes through. Despite the generosity of its maltiness, this impressive artwork appears quite dry on the palate, partly because of its exquisite toastiness, partly because of its very smooth, yet crisp carbonation, active and a constant reminder of the beers sincere desire to refresh.

Second day here, what more to do during the World Cup than, sadly, shop! Having none of that, I protested with a bevvie break, a lucky find I might add. This poured a paled, chestnut brown, bright and sparkling, sweating outside the glass in the searing heat. Some Schinken Scheiben to accompany it, I was hungry. Woody, though toffeeish, biscuity malts on the nose. A hint of cola, light roasted malt twitch and just a sprinkle of old, dried herbs on edge. The aroma failed to desist as I quaffed, always prominent, pronounced. It is smooth on the tongue, sweet and juicy, arousing the salival glands, exciting the nerve endings. Big malts in this one, woody, earthy and biscuity, clean and free of tannins. Munich malt seems in essence. Light spice mid-palate, remains sweet until it fades into musty, earthy hop heaven in the very back. Finish is floral for all of one second before it drops off sweet, bitter and slightly citric. Shows good length, doing the palate justice. Tasty no question, balanced beyond belief and lip-smacking good. Now whered the wife go!!!!","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

1410,"2006-08-06",4.8,"I struggled to find fault with this beer, but have to stick with the high numbers, as it was just fabulous and is from one of my favorite styles of beer. The aroma was malty, caramel, nuts, although not easy to pick up. I thought I detected a touch of bubblegum too. The appearance was beautiful, pouring as pretty as any altbier, light copper color with a nice fluffy head, and superb lacing on the way down. Flavor was tilted more to the malty side than Uerige of Fucshcen, but as with any fine alt, still with some display of the hoppy bitter balance. Touches of nuts were behind a fruitiness that was quite pleasant. Wood barrells easily detectable and very pleasant in the flavor. Mouthfeel was perfect, smooth, tilted a touch to the moderately heavy side for the style. I had to stop after 3 of these only to save some steam for the next two stops of the night, but if you hit Im Schlussel in Dusseldorf and nothing else, youve done just fine.

1410,"2006-01-28",5.0,"If and when you venture to Dusseldorf, you must visit Hausbrauerei Zum Schlussel located in the Altstadt, and enjoy some glasses of Zum Schlussel Altbier. Like all the altbiers poured at the various brewery/brewpubs this beer is poured by gravity from a wooden barrel. Zum Schlussel altbier was one of the most impressive I tasted on my trip to Dusseldorf, and rivals Zum Uerige, the bench mark example of altbier. 

Zum Schlussel altbier pours to a beautiful, bright, deep copper color with a bright white head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is very inviting with herbal/grassy hop aromas. The leads into a palate of clean, smooth, light nutty malt flavors, that give way to tangy/estery fruit flavors. Schlussel finishes with more clean malty and fruity flavors up front, then ends with a snappy herbal hop bitterness that lingers. 

Wow! This was such an enjoyable, delicious beer that was just packed with aromas and flavors of malt, hop, and fruit, and on such a fresh, clean, smooth body. I can not over state the freshness of this beer, and all the alts I tried. The character is just so amazingly bright and clean at its source, something you just dont get in the bottled versions of these beers. I really enjoyed the nice contrast of malt and fruit character in this beer, and the fruitiness of Schlussel distinguishes this beer from other examples of alt. Zum Uerige is still my personal favorite, but Zum Schlussel was a very close second. This beer is not exported to the United States, so to try this one, you will need to venture to Dusseldorf. A journey anyone who truly loves beer will be more than willing to make.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

That first smell and taste was absolutely stunning.  It was definitely up there with one of the best beers that I have ever had.  I was definitely not expecting this taste experience.
