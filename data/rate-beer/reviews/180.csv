180,"2012-06-14",4.0,"Draft at Cigar City during Hunahpu Day 2012. 

Pours a dark chocolate brown color thats nearly opaque with slight mahogany edges and a 1.5 finger frothy beige head that quickly settles into a lasting ring. Sporadic spots of lace left behind. 

Very inviting aroma with a nice sweet desert character in the nose. The oatmeal cookie presence is pretty strong but is nicely countered by the silky malt and lactic cream notes. Hints of cinnamon and brown sugar along with some sweet vinous fruit. Underneath the oatmeal cookie there is some silky chocolate malt with subtle roast and hints of creamy milk. Smells really nice. 

Medium bodied with a decent balance of oatmeal cookie and milk porter but unfortunately doesnt live up to the aroma. Im not a big fan of the regular oatmeal cookie brown ale and it is stronger here than the nose suggests. The roasted and sweet malts are there as well as a delicate lactic cream flavor but its a bit too subtle for me, resulting in a lack of balance to the cookie character. This was a really interesting experiment that I was very excited to be able to try. It doesnt quite live up to the incredible nose but was still pretty tasty.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
180,"2012-05-22",3.9,"This is a blend of 50% oatmeal raison cookie and 50% imperial milk stout On cask at the bruery. Pours dark brown with a mocha head. Aroma is all oatmeal raison cookie, I dont detect the milk stout in the aroma at all. Taste is spicy, cinnamon, malty, sweet and creamy. Finishes with strong chocolate. Tastes like drinking a chocolate chip cookie, with some oatmeal raison notes. Its a good beer, it might have been better using more imperial milk stout and less oatmeal raison.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","jcartamdg"
180,"2012-03-26",4.2,"Draft CCBs Hunahpus Day 2012 This beer rocks! Pours clear and dark brown (nearly black) with a mid-sized, creamy, khaki head. Excellent retention. The bouquet is a wonderful marriage of oatmeal cookies and chocolate cake with vanilla icing. Medium to full-bodied with a silky mouthfeel and tickling carbonation. The flavor offers slightly burned oatmeal cookie, bittersweet dark chocolate and more than a trace of vanilla. Theres a pleasant sweetness here. Finishes singed and bittersweet. Ive been wanting to try this concoction for over a year. Despite my sky-high expectations, this world class blend did not disappoint!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
180,"2012-03-13",4.7,"On tap at Cigar City Huna Day 2012. This was probably the highlight of my day. What a terrific aroma of cookies and lactose milk flavor. Just another reason why Cigar City continues to impress me and blow my doors off.",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"
180,"2012-03-12",4.1,"On tap at Hunahpus Day 2012. Aroma of Cookies and Cream Ice Cream... exactly like that... Its very sweet on the front end and has a nice burnt cocoa aftertaste that really mellows down the sweet on the front. This was very good and would love to see it in bottles.","Orlando, Florida, USA","mlunger12"
180,"2012-03-11",3.9,"Pours a dark brown color, aromas of cinnamon, oatmeal, molasses, raisins, and some lactose.  Flavors are much like a nice cookie, and had some smooth texture like milk.  Real nice beer overall that I wish I could drink all day and everyday.","Florida, USA","burg326"
180,"2012-03-11",4.3,"Awesome beer. Wow. The aromas from this beer were incredible. Loads of cinnamon, raisins, molasses, and some chocolate. Too good. Pour was black with a light tan head. This one was creamy and coated the mouth. I could sip on this beer all day. Flavors of heavy cinnamon and spice were followed up by molasses and a hint of chocolate. Malt galore on this one. Love it.","Florida, USA","OmegaX"
180,"2012-03-10",3.9,"I loved this beer! The smell was rich of brown sugar, yeast, raisins and chocolate - very mellow altogether. The taste was more on the bready side with a hint of raisins, finishing with a lingering cocoa aftertaste. Not sure if its better than regular oatmeal raisin though...","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"
180,"2012-03-10",3.9,"Really awesome beer sampled at Hunahpus day. Pours a deep dark brown with a thin tan head which doesnt hold. Aroma is oatmeal, cinammon, raisins, and sweetness. Flavor is rich, sweet, milky and creamy with a mild bite from the oatmeal. This thing is righteous. Nice lingering flavor but not for long. Damn theres too many beers today.","Florida, USA","tricyclist"
180,"2012-03-10",4.4,"Wow this is awesome. Pours unclear dar brown with a huge creamy caramel head. The awesome flavors of the oatmeal cookie are there and skightly overtaken by the creamy flavor and body of the porter!","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"
180,"2011-07-15",4.0,"Pours a jet black with a tan head. Aroma is oatmeal, cinnamon, spice, roasted malt. Taste is much the same. Palate has a very milky mouthfeel to it.","Orlando, Florida, USA","steelcitybrew"
180,"2011-05-25",3.8,"Cask at CCB.  Pours a dark brown with a slight off-white head.  Nose is big cinnamon, vanilla, raisin, white sugar, brown sugar, and a quality that tastes best like sweet cream or sugar and lactose.  Flavor is pretty tasty: cinnamon, sugary raisins, vanilla, lactose, and pieces of chocolate.  Light to medium in body and it finishes with lingering vanilla and lactose.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
180,"2011-05-13",3.5,"Firkin pour at CCB with mahogany body and tan head. The aroma has a decent load of graham cracker cookie and cinnamon followed by some dark fruity esters like raisins and prunes as well as anise spice and some dark roasted maltiness. The taste starts with a mild level of dark roasted malts then some prunes and raisin notes rolling into bold cinnamon notes as well as a pinch or two of nutmeg and anise spiciness. Toward midway chocolate and graham cracker cookie join in too. To the finish more anise like spiciness surface and help take the nearly over powering cinnamon notes into the finish.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
