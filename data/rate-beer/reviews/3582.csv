Les couleurs sont proches du orangé ou même caramel et je perçois même quelques reflets verdâtres au travers de mon verre. Je suis très surpris. Mon verre est rempli de levures en suspension. Nez de pain frais qui une fois agrémenté de ce côté salin de la Gose, me fait penser à un Bretzel. Curieusement, en bouche le sel est manquant pour le style. Il était présent au nez mais en bouche trop discret. Javais peut-être trop dattentes. Beaucoup de ce sucre qui confère un corps curieusement rond à cette Gose, le reste est axé sur la coriandre et les levures.

3582,"2015-05-22",4.1,"Tart lactic aroma with salty, lemon and slight spice. Taste is wheaty, lemony, salty, and of sour. Fairly sour, maybe 4 of 10 but I would say this is slightly less sour than say Westbrook gose, maybe about the same, but definitely not over the top sour. It is balanced and full flavored, and feels like a very authentic gose. With how puckering some other cascade beers are I was thinking this one might be more sour, but still great. That being said this is one of the best gose I have had, with Westbrook maybe edging it out? Maybe a tie. But Westbrook is $12 a 6 pack vs $25 a bottle. So at a 3rd the cost Westbrook wins. I love cascade. My favorite brewery overall, but for the cost I will buy their more complex sours. The gose is a lighter, more session able beer and the cost is prohibitive here. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone","East Greenbush, New York, USA","Mep3222"

Aroma has a moderate coriander character with some medium light wheat notes. Faint fruit esters and just a hint of sourness. 
Pours a cloudy, pale yellow gold with a thin, pillowy, white head that subsides fairly quickly to the edges even though bubbles continue to rise and replenish it. Light lacing and faint legs. 
Flavor has a medium tartness with a moderate amount of salt; this is definitely one of the saltier Goses that I have had, but also delicious. Medium wheat notes and moderate coriander flavor. Light citrus and tropical fruit. Low bitterness and faint alcohol spice. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth.

Love that this is a ""slightly sour"" its like they never traveled to Leipzig and drank the beer. This bitch is way more sour than the native versions Ive had.

Diaphonous grainy yellow with off-white, fleeting foam. Nose is briny and sour with some hints of grain, salt, pepper and yeast. The flavor is sour for the style - lemon, grain, hints of triscuits. The finish is a littles saliated and gives off a green olive brine character dominated with lactic tart. Thin and wet. This is a tasty beer, and I purchased a grenade of it, but I wouldnt place it too high among Goses.

The beer is pale yellow and clear, with minimal head that rapidly fades to nothing, leaving no lacing. The aroma is slightly sour and funky, with notes of citrus. The flavor is a step up from the aroma, with more salt presence. Nice citrus flavors. Slight sourness, but not puckering. The body is fairly thin, with low carbonation. Overall, a tasty beer.

3582,"2010-07-25",4.0,"Half pint on tap at the brewpub.  Aroma is quite floral with some fruity peach/apricot-like esters present.  Lightly sweet and pretty quaffable.  Moderately hazy dark golden body with a quickly dissipating small white head.  Starts a little tart with a really fine, effervescent carbonation.  Almost champagne-like.  Has a nice wheat body with some lingering tartness.  Nice floral notes with some soft salty notes present to finish.  Very champagne-like,  Refreshing and enjoyable.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
3582,"2010-07-05",3.4,"Verre de 12 oz, au Raccoon Lodge. Arômes épicées et florales, bonne touche de céréales et légère pointe dacidité. Robe pêche et trouble, peu de mousse et effervescence moyenne. Plutôt mince en bouche, on retrouve une base de céréales sûrettes et une touche épicée. Le sel, normalement retrouvé dans ce style, napparaît pas vraiment. Finale légèrement lactique. Rafraîchissant et pas mauvais, mais jespérais mieux de Cascade.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MJGG"
3582,"2010-06-26",3.9,"Tap @ Cascade/Raccoon Lodge...  They really hit the mark with this one.  Far superior than the very first Gose the attempted last summer.  Poured golden with a thin white head into a stemmed glass.  Tart, tangy with notes of herbs, and subtle sourness that is always welcomed and familiar on Gansbergs great beers.Earlier Rating: 7/18/2009 Total Score: 3.3Tap @ PIB...  Poured a hazy, pale golden with a white head.  Funky, yeasty and wheat aroma.  Tangy flavors with wheat and spiced, weed-like notes.  Earthy and herbal and the salt created a nice balance.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"

3582,"2009-12-07",3.7,"On tap at the PIB. Cloudy gold with a tall white head. Big spicy nose of citrus zest, coriander, and pepper. Crisp and dry, I didnt find the salt left much of an impression, but had a nice tart finish to it, very refreshing.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
3582,"2009-09-16",3.7,"growler - thanks scrizzz!! clear, faint gold with fuzzy white head; tart on the nose with mild funk, orange, grain and grapes; soft, fuzzy texture that drinks like a heavy berliner weisse ; plenty of brine on the nose and creates a very dry finish; quite interesting and in the end, very tasty","Seattle, Washington, USA","SuzyGreenberg"
3582,"2009-09-08",3.6,"Had this on tap today at Belmont Station in Portland, OR.  Colour... very light golden with scarcely any head. Nose... funky, lightly sour and slightly citrusy. Palate... mod. C02, lightly tangy, mildly funky, sweaty and a salty somewhat citrusy crispness to the finish. Rather like a Berliner weiss.","Portland, Oregon, USA","neepsntatties"

3582,"2009-08-18",3.7,"Wheat, some salted notes, sone tart lactic notes underneath akin to a berlinner weiss. Hazy golden orange with a thin foamy head. Salty wheat malt, lactic tartnes.zesty lively carbonation. A little salt watery in the finish. Light, delicate, and refreshing with really nice subtle flavors.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
3582,"2009-07-26",2.6,"Mystery Tap at PIB. Was a light, hazy golden color with a small white head. Honestly, the only thing I could think of while drinking this beer was popcorn. It had the aroma and flavor of butter, salt and corn, and the overwhelming feeling from the palate was of butter. Quite the letdown, and possibly the beer I enjoyed least at the event.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","Beardface"
