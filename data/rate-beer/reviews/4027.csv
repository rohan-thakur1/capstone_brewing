4027,"2016-02-22",4.5,"On tap at the Blackback Pub, Waterbury, VT.
This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a bronzed orange color with a thin white foamy head that dissipated immediately. There was barely any lacing.
The smell took into juicy orange pulp to lay over top of a nice bitter orange rind-like quality. Aromas just absolutely combine superbly.
The taste was pretty much the same with a fully bittersweet combined juicy flavor just absolutely stinging my taste buds appropriately. Nice juicy aftertaste riding on into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium in body with a stellar sipping quality about it. Carbonation rides fairly low allowing the juicy aspects to just hit the palate just right. Sliding motion across the tongue - like pure juice.

This one shows off a bit more deeper orange-copper tones, though a similar moderate haziness and the same unyielding massive, creamy white head.Similar amarillo/citra hop nose is full of lighthearted citrus (lemon oil, tangerine, ripe orange) and tangy, yet mostly dry stone fruits. Crackery-like malts are much, much more dry here than in the Works, yet both have a strong, uninterrupted hop profile in the nose. As an afterthought, light minerals, hints of yeast esters and bits of soft sugariness take up the act of rounding out and balancing. Lovely tangerine pulpiness lingers; citric but juicy and light. No alcohol/flaws.Tangy orange notes combine with a hint of peach and zesty, leafy tea-like character (darjeeling-like) with stone fruit and candied lemon zest. The malts are dry, wonderfully attenuated and perfectly integrated with the hops, leading to a drinkable beer that neither overdoes the hop bitterness nor malt sweetness.
