Hazy yellow-orange with a nice pillow of foam. Doesnt yield an impressive head, but sticks around long enough to compensate.

Nose is citrus acidity. Orange is the best descriptor. Grainy wheat with just a touch of funk in the aroma. Straightforward, but maybe lacking in some complexity.

Tastes of sour-forward citric flavors. Orangy and lemony. Oaky and a little bit of a white wine flavor. Definitely lacking in the complexity of some of the great gueuzes, but what it provides is exemplary.

Sweeter than other gueuzes. Not as dry. Very tart, but too much sugar to be spritzy.

369,"2016-02-02",4.7,"2008 Vintage: Consumed in JAN:2016.

Note: Bottle bought and consumed at Moeder Lambic. Stored in proper cellar conditions.

AROMA: More pronounced and refined than a fresh bottle. Maybe a hint more parmesan cheese and tropical fruit. Green apples also seemed to some through in smell and taste.

APPEARANCE: Deeper in colour less head retention. Oily, less lively.Possibly more lacing on the glass than the usual recent vintages.

TASTE: Oakier, Creamier, funkier, oilier, more balanced and refined. Green apples and tropical fruit. Noticed a slightly peppery note you might associate with Saisons, perhaps this is a by product of Brett being given additional time to develop?

PALATE: Less of a quencher and more of a sipper. Long lasting, creamy, thicker, slicker, cloying mouth feel. Just so much more balanced than a current vintage, though also Intense. Carbonation certainly took a back seat however it was still present though due to saturation. I believe it allowed other flavour notes to shine through more and become more or less pronounced.

OVERALL: Its a better beer when aged. Its different though retains the Cantillon stamp. Everything seems more concentrated and surprisingly the oak characters were much more pronounced. I like a fresh Gueuze very much but the 2008 Vintage is proof this is a beer which will refine when stored correctly.

369,"2015-08-21",4.3,"The most classic Cantillon product I presume, one of the great archetypes of the oude geuze style, and it says a lot about Jean Van Roy that he even refuses to use the legally designated phrase ""oude"", thereby ostentatiously ignoring the fact that there are many sweetened deviations from the original geuze. I must have enjoyed this one many dozens of times in the past fifteen-odd years, but suddenly noticed I hadnt even rated it here yet... Shame on me for overlooking such a world classic. Hazy peach golden colour with fine sparkling like a lambrusco, supporting a thin but moussy, off-white head, breaking open but (at least initially) retaining well on the edges and leaving a greyish veil over the liquid. Fairly strong and very funky aroma exactly like I remember it: wine vinegar, lemon juice, wet wood, fino sherry, white grape peel, wet hay, horseblanket, unripe stonefruit, musty cellar, stale sweat, steeped lentils, lots of redcurrant and gooseberries - an acquired taste, but as lambicy as can be. Puckering acidity in onset, very lemony, softening after a while but lasting till deep into the throat, with medium but finely tingling carbo again like lambrusco and paired with an array of fruity esters: redcurrant, white grape, green plum, starfruit. Lean and supple bready and wheaty middle phase upon which a complex of lasting fruity esters and a mellow, yoghurty lactic acidity are built; grows more and more woody in the end, drying along with the sourness, though a juicy, bready maltiness remains, as well as a powdery, dusty yeast feeling. A very deeply buried but palpable, very earthy old hop bitterness further dries the finish and lasts for quite a while, deaf and not providing any aroma, as is custom for the style. Unforgettable, this is just like I remember it, though I did have more acidic editions - or maybe that is just my palate having grown used to sour beers throughout the years. Whatever the case, this is one of those classics in every sense of the word, though perhaps not the most accessible example of its style. I hope it will stay around for a long time to come, as an advertisement of Belgian lambic culture, which was basically the last sour beer culture to survive before sour beer styles were taken up by the new craft beer movement.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Goudgele, honingachtige iets troebele kleur, met kleine en dunne witte schuimkraag die snel wegtrekt, een dunne ring van schuim blijft op het bier drijven. De geur is bijzonder, witte wijnachtig, bierkelder/barnyard, hooi, citroengras, zelfs ook kaasachtige aroma's. De smaak is complex, de eerste tonen zijn behoorlijk zuur en kort daarop vrij bitter. Door de behoorlijke carbonatie heeft het iets weg van brut champagne, maar dan met meer zuur en bitter erin. Tonen van citrusfruit; citroen, limoen en grapefruit. Witte wijnazijn en wat houtige tonen, met een zeer droge en subtiel bittere hopfinish. Fraai en erg mooi gebalanceerd Gueuze Lambic bier, ik ben benieuwd naar de andere Cantillon varianten die ik ook nog in het wijnrek heb liggen.

Speaking of which- upon your first time walking into the brewery youre hit with, what you later realize is the house terroir which this beer encompasses and embodies in all its greatness. Execution has been consistent for years, and this takes the nod as the beer that got me into lambic many years ago. One of the most solid, if not the best fresh gueuze available on the market. Aging does this wonders as well. Having sampled examples from the 70s through current, I can say without doubt that this gueuze certainly defies the test of time.

Cantillon gueuze 14 vintage

Pours a straw-yellow color, with a spongy, stable head, which is half a finger broad.

Exhibits an unbelievable balance between funky tartness, dusty wood and slightly spiced, citraic fruitiness. Reveals a plethora of subtle aromas, adding depth to the nose, a whiff of glue, old yogurt, vinegar and leather - leading to a unique smelling beer, full of little details.

Reveals a refreshing mouthfeel, due to the high carbonation, medium bodied beer.

Doesnt taste particular fruity in a sense of being specifically heavy on apples or very orange-like, while the beer does feature in fact a generous fruit note, with a lemony crispness to it. This impression gets balanced by musty, leathery malts, matured hops and vinegar, establishing a long lasting sourness. There is almost an explosion on the palate, as the carbonation hits the tongue, establishing an intense dryness, which is noteable until the very end. Finishes with a full-scale, crisp dryness, which doesnt numb the palate from receiving more subtle flavors though.

No fruits are needed to make this a great beer. I am astonished by its complexity, based on the beers lower abv. So much going on, while every aspect is artfully integrated in the beers taste, and interacts very well with its overall refreshing character.","GERMANY","aleigator"

369,"2013-12-05",3.9,"Rating from 25.3.2008: Mein Bier ist laut Korken 2002 abgefüllt, hat somit also 6 Jahre gelagert. 
Ich hab diese schon etwas ältere Variante vor ein paar Wochen durch Zufall in St. Vith im Delhaize gefunden - die hatten hinter den neuen Flaschen noch eine etwas älter aussehende Flasche, die noch kein Abfülldatum auf der Rückseite trug - also hab ich sie neben einer 2008er Flasche zum Ausprobieren mal mitgenommen. 
Nach entfernen der schwarzen Alufolie offenbarte sich mir ein total verrosteter Kronkorken. Ich weiß jetzt, warum die Biere noch einen echten Korken tragen - sonst hätte ich das Ganze nämlich wegschütten können. 
Nach entfernen des Kronkorkens musste ich unter fließendem Wasser ersteinmal den ganzen Rost von der Flasche schrubben... 
Der Korken war auch schon sichtlich gealtert und sah schlimmer aus als von nem 25jährigen Wein - immerhin war er nicht auseinandergebröselt... 
Jetzt aber zur Bierbewertung: 
Der deutlich ausgeprägte Geruch ist sehr frisch, lebendig, leicht fruchtig und nicht zu übersäuert. 
Auch bei meiner Variante hält sich der Schaum nicht sonderlich lange. 
Das Bier ist sehr CO²-haltig und beim ersten Schluck bei weitem nicht so sauer wie erwartet. Schon der Nachgeschmack des ersten Schluckes ist überwältigend - ich schmecke ein komplexes Frucht-Holz-Hefearoma, über dem eine leicht herbe Säuerlichkeit schwebt, die aber außer im Antrunk überhaupt nicht dominant auftritt. Schon der Hauptteil ist von einer milden Cremigkeit geprägt, der komplexe und schwierig zu beschreibende Nachgeschmack ist sehr lange anhaltend. 
Die 6 Jahre Lagerung - auch wenn es die unterste Etage eines Supermarktregales war, ist dem Bier doch sichtlich gut bekommen. 
Es ist natürlich vor allem im Antrunk noch immer sehr sauer, aber ich empfinde diese Saure Note als sehr angenehm und auch gut bekömmlich(im Gegensatz zu z.B. dem jungen Cantillon Kriek, was ich vor ein paar Wochen probiert habe). 
Es hat was mild-cremiges und ist dadurch auch sehr süffig. 
--> kann jedem nur empfehlen, seine Geuze auch mal ein paar Jahre (viell. dann besser im Keller) ruhen zu lassen!! Test vom 25.3.2008, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 12,13,12,14,13,13 - 12,90","Wuppertal, GERMANY","Erzengel"

369,"2013-08-08",4.1,"This is one of those beers that is a prime reason everybody should visit Brussels at least once. Ridiculously cheap if bought three or six at a time you are rewarded with a world classic lambic that could double as a daily drinker if you had the ability to get more regularly. 

Aroma / Appearance - The golden base had a cloudy tint due to some agitation of the bottle. Streams of fresh carbonation rise up like a nice champagne. A ring of white head adds to the beauty. The scent of spicy oranges and gym socks are present. Fresh the vinegar has yet to really sink in and as a result this is not completely sour.

Flavor / Palate - Vinegar and blue cheese fill the mouth with a crisp texture. Lemons and then a bubbly finish highlight a beer with plenty of complexity but not one that tries to be over the top. Like an excellent champagne it relies on subtlety to achieve its ends. I wish I had more room in my luggage to bring home more.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

369,"2013-04-29",4.6,"Picture this:
Youre standing in the door of a threshing barn, looking out over an orchard with apples, lemons and oranges.
The setting sun pours an amber haze over everything. You close your eyes and feel the suns warmth on your face, and the smells of the fruit - sweet and sour, almost stinging -, and barn - wood, somewhat mouldy, different cereals, dust, undefinable funk - swirl and mingle.
And you feel like youd want to stay there forever.

Thats Cantillon geuze: amber to golden colour, your expected barnyard funky smell, and a very sour bite to it, just enough alcohol to warm you without burning. Its a geuze, and i happen to love those, and this one is quite exceptional.

369,"2013-01-22",4.4,"Reviewed 12/31/2012. Thanks to Momar42 for all three gueuzes (and the kriek surprise afterwards!) This was part of the gueuze showdown, pitting Tilquins gueuze against the juggernaut duo known as Cantillon Gueuze and Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze. Part of a 750mL bottle poured into a Cantillon tulip. Notes from last nights Skins/Cowboys game.

A: Pours a hazy golden color. The head is a half finger white color with poor retention.

S: This one had the most balanced hybrid between winy fruit tartness and earthy funk. A very expressive aroma, and the best one of the three (by a small margin).

T: Acetic sourness comes on the palate fast and hard, and then afterwards cheesy, earthy funk...finishes the flavor profile fast and hard. This was the boldest and most complex of the three, yet it wasnt that much harsher than the 3F (certainly it was somehow more subtle than Tilquins offering). Shockingly easy to drink for me.

M: The finish is the dirtiest and most tannic of the three, closing the palate with big dryness, yet minimal harshness. This one is actually pretty thick in its texture, accentuating a fuller level of carbonation than the 3F Oude Geuze.

O: This was the winner in my book - but I wouldnt dare recommend this one to beginners. There is a sense of subtle delicacy to it; however the bigness of the acetic sourness, wet hay, and cheesy funk WILL scare off the average Fat Tire drinker the way a celery stalk scares off a fat kid. And moreso than the other two gueuzes, in fact. To those acclimated to the styles idiosyncrasies, this ones hard to beat.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"
369,"2013-01-22",4.1,"375ml Bottle from Good Spirits Co., Glasgow (£5.20):
Tarty initally with some sourness and a fair amount of lemon and sour grapes. There is a lot of different fruits noticeable on the nose; these include some apple and peach along with a strong acidic aroma.

Bright and cloudy, orange amber colour with a one centimetre tall, short lived head that was bubbly and disappeared fast leaving only a few bits of white lace around the circumference on the glass.
Acidic and tarty up front with a nice mix of lemon, some vinegar and sour grapes. There is some lemongrass and a nice acidic bite with plenty of additional sourness. The flavour is one that enhances tenfold once left to settle for a few minutes too.

Very smooth, sour and tarty on the palate with a light body, plenty of carbonation and a crisp finish.

Quite a good beer, but only after it opens up a little and has been left to settle for a couple of minutes to left the extremly sour and tarty flavours die down some. It was a great beer though with plenty of depth and character, it was also pretty much what I was expecting for the beer.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

369,"2013-01-13",3.9,"Vaaleankullankeltainen ja lähes kirkas olut omaa pienen vaahdon. Hiilihappoisuus on hyvin havaittavissa kuplien määrästä. Haju on hyvin happaman tallimainen.

Maku on jälleen hapan, tallimainen, hyvin sitruunainen/greippinen, mainen, nahkainen ja hieman marjainenkin. Suutuntuma on hyvin pirskahtelevan hiilihappoinen, mutta melko tasapainoinen. Yleensä lambiceissa on hiilihappoja melkeimpä liikaa, mutta nyt se on kurissa. Kokonaisuutena klassikko, joka ei petä.

Taste is sour and typical of gueuze. Brett, green apple and barnyard are also there. Mouthfeel is dry  and acidic. This one will compete with Girardin Black Label and 3F Oude Gueuze to be my go-to gueuze. Awesome balance while being quite complex and amazingly drinkable/refreshing! 

EDIT:  I tried the 02 and 13 side by side @ Cantillon Quintessence 2014. The appearance and the aroma were quite similar, though the 02 had a little more sourness. The main difference is in the taste, where the 02 was a lot more sour than the 13. It was still nicely balanced despite the sourness. It wasnt crazily sour either. The 13 was more lemony and hay forward. The 02 was a little dryer than the 13. I think I slightly preferred the 13 because the balance was a little better, but  my rating for both will stay the same as the rating above.

Alcohol VERY present, with a mild hint of sweetness teasing the tongue.  Complex and inviting, unlike most Guezes Ive tasted, which beat me over the head with sourness and never let me experience any other flavors.

369,"2012-10-14",4.0,"Bottle provided by Baron whilst watching football. Thanks for bringing the Loons bro, I love drinking dis shit. 2011 vintage poured into a New Belgium tulip. Poured a golden brown in color with about a fingers worth of tight white head. Its hazy in clarity. Nose is comprised of lemon and a ton of dirty funk. Its surprisingly funky for this stage in its development. There is must, horse blanket, wet hay, and some cat piss. Flavor is less funk focused, there is still some sweetness accompanied by the lemon rind. There is some funk on the finish, but not a bunch. Mouthfeel is light, carbonation is low, gentle acidity, and a moderate finish. I love Classic Gueuze/Gueuze BIO/etc., so I always think its a treat to have.

T-- More like lemonade in the taste. Slightly thin and under sugared lemonade with some lime and lemon grass. Loses the apple, straw and vinegar from the nose. 

M-- Bright and crisp with lively carbonation and feel. More like the smell. Lots of tart apple, lemon and other citrus. High amounts of acid with vinegar soaked straw in the mid and back palate. Long lasting tart lemon grass finish. Nice amount of funk with the acid in the finish. 

O-- Have had a few of the 09 cork dated bottles and have wanted to have this fresh so can compare. Prefer older vintages as just more complex and rounded. That being said a fresh 750 is easy to drink where an older one is just difficult with the acid and funk that develops. Great gueze but was just lacking in the taste for me.

369,"2012-05-20",5.0,"It should be noted this review relates to Cantillon Cuvée De Florian. 75cl bottle shared at Akkurat. Poured in a stemmed glass. Vintage: 1996; according to the bartender, this beer is the regular Cantillon Classic gueuze produced with an extra bit of love (i.e. the best lambic at the time) as it was named in honor of Jean Van Roys first born son, Florian. Sweet golden yellow. Half (bubbly white) fingernail head on gentle pour. Smells mostly of oak and aged cheese. Notes of classic Cantillon gueuze - barnyard funk, must, and lemon have held up amazing over time. This beer smells heavenly! Taste follows smell precisely. Nice balance of oak, cheese, straw, and funk with perfectly timed citrus note near the end. This beer is so easy drink, well-rounded, crisp and smooth. Not a single flaw in the taste. Absolutely beautiful! Light bodied with appropriate carbonation. Not too sharp or rounded; just right. This is exactly why I think Cantillon can withstand the test of time and develop beautifully with age. This beer is so balanced, crisp, and amazing.

369,"2012-03-12",4.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 9/28/2011.  Poured from a 350 mL bottle into a tulip. Thanks to bauermj for bringing this over.

The pour is a slightly hazy soft golden color with a small white cap.

The smell has a perfect balance of tart and funk. A fair funky aroma, full of barnyard, some must, horse blanket, lemon zest, and some leather. This is just an awesome aroma.

A soft start to the flavor has some light grains, then some strong tartness for the rest of the sip. Lemon zest and general citric tartness. The finish has some funk and stinky cheese to go along with a bit of woody oak. 

This is a light to medium body, with fairly delicate carbonation. Tart, lightly acidic, with a strong funk toward the end. Some tannic oak astringency toward the end. Fairly dry. The finish was lightly watery as well. 

This is a very nice gueuze. Sour and funky in a nice balance.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

In addition I also sence wheat, citric acid, horse blanket and something floral. The flavour also contains a fairly crisp acidity, not far from bitter berries, but also a nice amount of fruit.

Intense sour aroma, vinegar, rubberthis style is always lost on me but Im liking it more now than when I first had them.  Taste is better than I thought it would be. Sour white grape, darkness, old apples.  Dark aftertaste with a lingering better.

Aroma- Lots of citrus and barnyard funk in the aroma, very much what I would like in an elite gueuze.

Appearance- Orange/golden in color with some head, a few bubbles clung to the edge of the glass while drinking.

Taste- Up front, sour and funk, neither overpowering, but both contributing to a very enjoyable flavor. The aftertaste is where this beer separates itself from other beers in the style. The 3 yr. old portion was brewed by the Isabelle Proximus crew with Amarillo hops, and this comes through in the orange and peach flavors present in the finish. Excellent!

Palate- The citrus flavors linger nicely on the tongue. Very easy to drink without taxing the ol palate.

Overall- I (and my friends) could have ordered some more Fou Fone (2007 at that!) for the table to drink for our last round and we went with this instead. This was a great, inventive take on the gueuze style.","Pennsylvania, USA","phillybeer7779"

Look at my old original rating from 2011, I think this was by far my highest rated lambic and I rated it 3.1. Nowadays I love this beer. The essence is still the same though: I really love the balanced sour fruitiness in this beer. Very well done. -- Original rating: 6-3-6-3-13=3.1 - I dont like sourness in a beer. I dont like 99 out of 100 sour ales, wild ales, lambics or fruitbeers. But after tasting the Cantillon Kriek, which was way better and way more balanced then other krieken or lambics, I was very curious about other Cantillon brews. To other raters a 3.1 may be a low score. I found this beer to be pure sour and very very well balanced, but just too sour for me. I dont dislike it, but its just not my style.

I detect notes of funk, citrus, hay, cherries and limes.  Taste is puckeringly sour with notes of sourdough, french oak, hay, and the aforementioned fruits.

369,"2011-06-28",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2012 Bottling date of March 17, 2010. Got this 750ml via trade. After months of contemplating when to drink it...I finally cracked it on a random Tuesday when I was out of work early and its hot as hell out. Capped and corked bottle, absolutely love the label and look of this bottle. I cracked the cap and found some vile smelling yellow liquid sitting above the cork. Decided to give it a taste....straight acid. The spider webbed cork pulled out with a very faint pop. First glass was poured into a palm tulip at near cellar temperature. The rest of the bottle went into the fridge for some temperature variation. Pairing this with some fresh caprese salad drenched in balsamic vinegar.

A - Deep golden color, lots of bubbling, and a really impressive white, foamy head that died down slowly. Lacing was pretty dismal.

S - The first thing I thought of was sparkling apple cider...and then came the wall of funk. Lots of bretty goodness, hay, sour lemons, and oak.

T - Near perfect. The mouth feel is just so dry, lively and crisp. It just compliments the amazing flavors profile. Sour apples and lemon, barnyard funk, hay, grass, and light oak flavors. 

O - This just surpassed Drie Fonteinen oude as my favorite gueze. This is such a well crafted beer that was worth the wait.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

The color of this one is somewhat unusual to me. Its a golden-orange, but not in the way a ""normal"" beer is. This one ""looks thicker"", if that makes any sense. There is virtually no head, only tiny bubbles. Probably normal for this style? Next: aroma. At the first smell I definitely get what must be the barnyard funk Ive read so many times. Also, a bread-like component here, and a hint of something fruity, peach perhaps? And of course the expected sour vinegar-like aroma is in place. Otherwise, Im having difficulty finding the proper words here. So I take a sip. WHOA! What was that? I got some hop flavor there, and something else, I think its yeasty esters, and a MASSIVE sourness! And then some really well done, almost burnt barbecued meat?! Nope, didnt expect that!

The nose is hard to describe, sour with notes of apple and perhaps even a hint of salt. The taste confirms the nose with an apple vinegar start and middle and definitely a long note of salt on the end. The palate - how do you describe something that doesnt have the traditional constructs of structure, texture and bitterness. This is sour from start to finish and rather than making you thirsty to have another drink, it makes you contemplate it for a while and then take another sip.....never a gulp.

369,"2011-02-21",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2013 2008 Vintage, Green bottle with yellow label. ""Classic Gueuze"".

A careful pour into my Duvel glass produces a bright orange/amber/peach colored beer with a firm white head that dissipates rather quickly, with not much lacing.

The smell is bright and sour with hints of citrus, pear, apple peel, and some funk as well.

I almost coughed after the first huge quaff of this, something in here is really sinus clearing. It has a nice tart fruit tang, with some shock tart acid as well, though it isnt overly sour like some beers. It has a good subtle sweetness to balance out the sourness and a decent mouthfeel, if a tad bit watery. Hints of pale malt, green apple, and yeast come out in the aftertaste.

The object of a Gueuze shouldnt be making something unbearably sour, and this one isnt, it is almost a perfect gueuz,

The nose on this beer was unreal, like a super sharp cheese rind followed by a pervasive dry oak scent.  Taste was typical gueze with some barnyard funk and tart green apple notes.  Only real complaint was that the body was a little watery.  Hard to believe how dry this beer is, makes you feel like you need to keep an emergency glass of water on hand.  Oak and stale cheese flavors are found throughout.  The finish is dry and crisp.  I think this one benefited from some aging, it really sharpened the flavors compared to a fresh bottle.

369,"2010-08-24",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 25, 2012 2009 bottle.  So this is gueuze??  My first attempt at this crazy belgian concoction.  The smell, I dont wet dog, horse blanket, ass???  Yea, ill go with ass, sweaty, musty, dank ASS.  Amber in color with a tiny white head.  The taste is surprisingly pleasant, and to think that funk near the bottom of the cork made me a little hesitant.  Its light and refreshing with lots of tart green apples, lemon zest, and just a hint of funk.  Its very dry and kinda reminds me of cheap champagne, ehrr, I mean cheap sparkling wine.....

369,"2010-08-18",4.9,"12.7 oz bottle.  How has it take me so long to get to this beer?  Here we go.  Cork ready ""Bottle 2009"", so its somewhat fresh gueuze.  The cork was in there tight as a bugger.  Upon taking it out, it expanded so much that there would be absolutely no hope of fitting it back in the bottle.  Hazy orange pour with a descent white head that holds respectably well.  Best lace I have ever seen.  Just a wall of it, as if my glass had a white lining.  Very beautiful balance aroma that reminds me of my childhood for some reason unknown to me. Reminds me of the country.  Sour green apples, typical Cantillon acidity, and a hint of barnyard funk.  The aroma is more balanced and less extreme than most other top notch gueuzes Ive had.  The flavor is impeckable.  Perhaps one of the best gueuzes Ive had.  Not outrageously tart and acidic, but certainly tart and acidic.  Tons of green apples, fresh juicy lemons, and a bit of funk with a bone dry finish.  Not much lacto pedio cheesiness here.  So refreshing.  The mouth feel is OUTSTANDING.  It feels full bodied and lazy, and yet somehow has some very fine carbonation to tickle the throat after swallowing.  I absolutely LOVE how this is not over-carbonated like so many other lambics, gueuzes in particular.  Overall: If there is a heaven, God will most certainly have an eternal supply of this on tap.  I am giving this a 4.9 because I don;t have it in me to give a 5.0.  Maybe after a try it a few more times I will be confident to give it that status.  But, right now, there is no such thing as a 5.0 beer.  This really pushed that perception I hold though.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

369,"2010-07-31",4.6,"Bottled in 1996. Beer geeks tend to cellar bottles to commemorate the birth of their child. When youre the brewer of Cantillon I guess you have other options.

Looks like their standard gueuze, but has a metallic smell to go with the usual funk, oak, and woodsorrel. Tastes like -bal aged lemons with a little white wine. Ever smelled the scum that gets trapped under your fingernails? Thats what the finish tastes like. All aspects of the beer are crystal clear. A remarkably vivid gueuze for its age.

This was assembled with Cantillons ""best lambic"", according to the Akkurat bartender. As the only difference in label from the Classic Gueuze is a plain sticker that reads ""Cuvée de Florian"", this may be more of an exercise in psychology than brewing. Either way, any fourteen year old Cantillon product is nothing to sneeze at. This is truly a dynamic fluid.Earlier Rating: 7/31/2010 Total Score: 4.3750 ml of the 03 bottling courtesy of mikey711. Opened on my birthday, an aged gueuze for an aged guy. I wonder which of us has fared better these last seven years.

Were both wanner and funkier than before, but the gueuze is downright fruity. Notes of pear, chords of cider, and an opera of lemon. Age has mellowed us. Its smoother, but still sour. Suaver, but prickly yet. I was going to include something about lambic ""gaining wisdom"" in the barrels as a parallel to education, but this is getting too complicated.

I wasnt sure if the bottle would be worth opening, whether itd be palatable or in an unsavory state of flux. But its aging gracefully. Hopefully I can follow suit.","The Court of the Crimson King, California, USA","afrantzell"

369,"2010-07-28",4.3,"Draft, City Beer Store.  A wonderful beer and an excellent take on the style.  This isnt my favorite gueuze in the world, but thats hardly a real complaint.  This beer pours yellow-orange and fairly cloudy with a tight white cap.  Theres a ton of funk, fruit and grain in the nose.  It smells of barnyards, lemons, sour apples, hay, grass and leather.  The taste is dry with a big sour bite.  Ive had a couple bottles of this beer in the past, and the keg seemed a bit tarter, though I have no idea of its age.  The beer tastes like lemons and brett.

I simply cant believe I havent rated this one. I would have taken tasting notes! Oh well, plenty of bottles in the cellar. Pretty mellow, at least at this age, in terms of the beloved Cantillon house character. Wood is prominent in nose, some honey, an Orval-like herbalness. Lovely lemon joins the above in the flavors.  Not as aggressive as I might have expected, easy drinking in the sense that its very tasty but not overwhelmingly complex -- perhaps the relative youth of the bottle contributes to that.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

A-thin bubbly pure white head, surprisingly carbonated after all these years. Light orange in color with hues of a deep yellow. It is somewhat clear with a cloudiness floating around

S-the nose is very musky up front. Manure, mushrooms, earthy funkiness up front. Light notes of sourness in the back with little tartness.

T-the earthy musk lies up front but is faint and works with the rest of the beer. Sour funk takes over with some candied and sour fruits towards the back. Light hints of bitterness and vinegar at the finish.

M-smooth and creamy with a medium to light body and high carbonation (again a shock how well this is holding up). Crisp and prickly at the back with a dry finish

D-the sour/tartness with all the funk are interesting but make this not as drinkable as Id like. The complexity and big flavors, however, do a really nice job of gaining my interest and the smoothness on the palate do make it inviting.

369,"2010-06-17",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2012 Absolutely classic. Id probably take Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze and Girardin Black by a hair as far as everyday geuzes go though.  I have had many times both bottle and draft, but I finally got around to sitting down and reviewing one.

2009 Vintage opened Summer 2010.
A: Orange-gold body. Just the slightest bit of haze. Fairly large, 3 finger, bubbly head. Good retention and a nice soapy lacing.
S: On first whiff, this has all the barnyard funk of the brightest, mustiest saisons. Lemons, oranges, horsebanket, and a bit of earth. Then you start to sense the tartness and sourness that will come. Then you realize you are drinking a top flight gueuze.
T: Like the nose, there is lots of funk. Sour lemon. Fresh squeezed orange. Light breadyness. General acidic citrus notes. Complex and layered. Very nice.
M: Medium bodied. Lively, but not unrestrained carbonation. Nice zing on the tongue. Good sour/tart finish. I dont find it puckering, but it is an aggressive experience on the tongue.
O: Whenever I have a good gueuze I cant help but say to myself, I would like to wake up every weekend and drink one for breakfast with waffles, whipped cream and fresh fruit. Cantillon is highly regarded for a reason.... this is just one of many.

Since ratebeer lists the Cuvee De Monks also under this listing, my review of that is below (8/4/9/4/19).  One of the joys of living a few blocks from both Monks and the Belgian Cafe (sister bar of Monks)
A: Hazy orange-straw body. Moderate frothy egg-shell white head. Nice collar but no lacing left behind.
S: Sour green apples, acidic lemon blast, juicy orange and grapefruit. General wheat undercurrent and all-around funky goodness.
T: Very nice. Kicks it into a whole new level of funk. Tart lemons, sour green apples and grapes. Orange, grapefruit, and wheat round things out. Good lactic character pairs well with the oaky-earthy vibe.
M: Medium bodied. Exceptionally smooth. Nice lingering tart finish that doesnt distract from all the great flavors that came right before it. Remarkably refreshing.
O: The blend of lambics that Tom and Jean used to make this gueuze is nothing short of exceptional. Even more funky that the classic gueuze, but somehow keeps everything refined and sublime. This is one to track down... just come to Philly.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
369,"2010-06-14",3.8,"I tried the Cantillon Gueuze a few times while traveling through Belgium. The first time I had it with dinner (Ham and Kaas Toastie with eggs over easy on top). It was great to pair this beer with food. The smell is pungent and fruity with a dry twinge. The taste is sour, complex and comes in three waves of flavor. First sour, then fruity, then dry with a bitter finish. A really great beer to have with food. 

The second time I had the beer I had it in the Cantillon Brewery. It was as great as I remembered, but would prefer to drink this beer while eating some food. The beer is not quite crisp enough to go it alone. For this I would recommend the Gueuze Giardin.

Enjoyed this blend at Monks Cafe with beerloco, mrs. beerloco, deliriumfest, ms. delirumfest, and dbhog yesterday.

Appearance: The body is closer to straw than golden while the crown and lacing are minimal. Still a solid gueuze look imho.

Smell: Oh baby this one just sings! A touch of spicy meets a symphony of sourness and barnyard. It has its vinegar moments but they dont dominate whatsoever. More of the acidity in the nose comes in more of an extra bitter lemon manner.

Taste: Well refined sums it up. Loads of complexity here but tons of separation as well. Nice blended dose of sourness, citric notes and funk. More like leather than horseblanket.

Mouthfeel: fairly thin and lively carbonation.

Drinkability: This is a fantastic beverage that could serve you well all evening!

A-Body is a uniform translucent, very hazy golden yellow color. Pours with virtually no head.

S-The nose in this brew is quite interesting. At first all that comes through is a huge barnyard funk-filled with earthiness, mustiness, mossiness...etc...but once the nose has become accustomed to this assault a lot of apple comes through-tart, juicy, and sweet-this comes no where near balancing the funk-but its certainly there.

T-Flavor is pretty interesting as well. Lots of funk comes through across the board but there are accents of apple and some other fruity sweetness. A big lactic sourness-not at all noticeable in the nose comes through for the finish and overpowers the initial flavors.

P-Very low, cask-like carbonation. Body is light weight but very full-quite smooth.

O- What a great opportunity to try this 96 vintage! Lots of sour and funk still hanging around in this brew-it has really held up well. Id like to try this a bit fresher so I can look back and compare the experiences.

369,"2010-03-24",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 10, 2012 **Cantillon Monks Cafe Cuvee Gueuze**  Really a completely unique blend from the ""regular"" Cantillon Gueuze.  From a bottle, pours a clear orange gold with a white head that settles to a ring around the glass.  Nose is sharp, citrusy, and really funky.  A lot of lemon and barnyard to this, very sharp.  Not as sour as the regular gueuze, much less puckering.  Lemon, hay, some white vinegar, neatly integrated brett and funk.  Balanced and refined, kind of this lemony, funky burst in the back palate.  Really neat montage of flavors, especially the way it unfolds on the finish.  Awesome.

May 2012 Edit.  The regular Classic Gueuze is better than the Monks Cafe Gueuze.  Several 2006 bottles have been near perfect.

369,"2010-03-13",3.8,"This one is an old time classic and I have enyoed it soo many times. I have always avoided serving it to new comers to the lambic world cause I always have thought that it was a pretty agressive gueuze. Appearently I have never rated it - but here goes. 37 cl bottle from Ølbutikken (also availeble rather cheap at Ørsted Ølbar if you want it a night out) Corked and caped like always with Cantillons - pretty cool. Served in the small fluty cantillon glass. Pours a fizzy and sparkling hay yellow with a rather thick foamy crown. The nose is some how artificial. Cleaning spirits and soap long with some urinals, vinegar and sour green apples - I love it ;-). The taste is goo plane sour with a low key finish where the bitter- and sourness gets softened by some sweetness. I find this as I said rather agressive and actually unbalanced compared to other gueuzes. That doesnt change the fact that I really like this beer - its powerfull with a temper and it freshens you up way better than 10 Red Bulls.

369,"2010-03-07",3.9,"37.5 cl Bottle. Vintage 2009.

Appearance: Murky golden with tiny, champagne-like bubbles. Easily diminishing white foam.

Aroma: Sour cider vinagar with lemon peel dryness. Low to moderate barnyardy yeast notes.

Flavor: Vivid, lemony-grapefruity bittersweet tartness plays the leading part. Some muscat grapes and a low amount of musty yeast notes hiding under the sour surface.

Mouthfeel/Palate: Quite easy bodied, but the viscoustiy of the yeast makes it really dense. Moderately high carbonation.

Overall Impression: A classic, traditional gueuze with medium to high acidity and remarkably thirst quenching nature. Its still a really great experience to had it freshly. An older vintage of this would be insanely complex. 
A pairing with some aged, moded cheese could be a perfect choice.","Budapest, HUNGARY","judasbeer"

369,"2010-02-27",3.6,"First of all, lets just get it out there: So far, Im not a huge Lambic fan. Then again, I suspect that were talking about an acquired taste here, so I have decided to buy lambics now and then despite my poor previous experiences - just to give the genre a chance. Ive done this earlier with for example IPAs and coffee stouts, to great success: after a while, I usually ""get"" the taste; what the beer is trying to say, what it is all about. And usually, one beer turns it all around. Cantillon Gueze might be one such turning points for me. Aside from having an inviting fresh, cloudy orange body and a mellow smell of yeast and grapes, it tastes rather...good. Sour, but refreshing in a lemonade kind of way. It has a very champagne-like dryness but is way more drinkable; perhaps due to the lower ABV. Whoever blended (""geuzed"") this one together did an excellent job. Nevertheless, I just cant seem to free myself from the distracting thought that its not really beer Im drinking, but rather some warped form of sparkling white wine. I guess I still have a distance to go before I can truly say I appreciate lambics. Still, Cantillon Gueze has put its foot in the door opening up to the world of lambics - and Im not gonna close it...","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

So damn drinkable in fact I enjoyed the entire bottle by myself and still wanted more. A dry and drawn out sourness leads into lemon, orange, and grapefruit flavors followed by musty yeast and sour dough bread. Upfront barnyard funkiness that is well received.

S: Now this is a funky beverage. A ton of Brett character with a tinge of lactic sourness and oak.

T: As funky as the nose is, thats how sour it is on the tongue. There is a lot of lactic tartness and its very acidic. Theres a bit of lemon flavor and a lot of Brett. On the finish is a fair bit of oak.

M: Surprisingly this is not all that bubbly. Im used to Gueuze being a very bubbly beverage, but I suppose that could be due to a short maturation period (ie. my fault).

It pours a cloudy light orange almost amber with a thin, white head that leaves little lace. Looks like melted butter in the glass. Aroma is funky, sweaty, tangy sour, full of citrus complexity. Taste is watery at first, not too intense, moving to full lactic sourness, lemon yogurt, feet, and finishes very spicy, sweaty, oaky, and massively sour. Really complex if you give it a chance to warm up. Palate is zippy, peppery, lemony sour, full of lactic yogurt.

369,"2010-01-11",4.0,"Pale yellow straw color. Slightly hazy. A small white and rather sparkling head settles quickly into a small ring of lacings.

A fantastic fresh and fine tuned smell. Aromas of both tart and overripe apples, tart berries, fresh hay and some vinegar. Apart from some very faint funky aromas of wet hay and yeast, this could have been the smell of a fine cider or a sparkling white wine.

The taste is just as fresh and tart as the smell. Tart apples, lemon peel with semi-sweet nuances, fresh hay, grass and some yeast. Wheat and malted barley. A very balanced character throughout the experience. In the finish, the tartness develops into a more sharp sour taste with a prominent character of lemon. The finish is dry and has notes of barrel, lemon pits, some phenols, a minimal grassy bitterness and everlasting sour notes. The funkiness is very restrained, but becomes present every now and then in the form of wet hay.

Medium body with a dry finish. The carbonation is very lively and sparkling. Overall, the beer has a very sparkling character, again like a cider or like a sparkling white wine.

This is a world class gueuze, with a rich and refreshing character. Very easy to drink and surely a ""fine wine of the beer world"".

Upon tasting, first of all Ive gotta say, this is pretty damn tart, like biting into a lemon through the skin and all. A fair whack of acidity, with little in the way of balancing sweetness. Once youve got used to it some oak and funk comes through. Not bad after a couple of sips!

Aroma: Sour fruits, apple, lemon, some funky yeast, tart and fruity

Appearance: Clear golden-orange color, with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly

Flavor: Similar to the nose, sour, tart, fruit, yeast

Palate: Light and dry

Overall Impression:
My first Gueze, so maybe I just dont have the taste for these that others do, but I wasnt overly impressed.  It is an interesting beer, and I will try be sure to try this style again, but as of now, I must say, Im not sure its quite what I had hoped for.  I believe I have another Gueze in my bottle reserve, so Ill have to see if that one changes my mind.
As for this beer, I found it to be a bit light of body, and overly sour, limiting my enjoyment of it a bit.  Light, dry, funky, sour, and fruity.  Look, Ill give it plenty of credit for its complexity, and it is not a bad drink by any means, but it is not going to enter my upper-tier/favorite list.  On the other hand, Im curious enough by the raves this style receives to try a few more before I do anything as drastic as dismiss it.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

Its so sour that it almost borders on bitter, like youre tasting something that isnt ripened yet. Its medium-bodied and smooth--dry and with just enough carbonation.

369,"2009-03-21",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2009 My bottle was labeled Classic Gueuze Ale Aged In Oak Barrels. It has an orange yellow label and its the shadow of an old dude falling back off his chair while downing some gueuze. Full-size green bottle, about a quart; with a stopper that was really tuff to remove. I eventually got it out but now there is some cork in my brew; oh well, adds to the personality. Label is quite interesting but does not interest me as much as the rose de grambius label. Good fresh barn aroma with no ill olfactory and it comes across as farmy or something.  Tho farmy, the aroma is not overwhelming. Pour is swirling hazy amber, good show.  For a mental picture, think about grapefruit soda that was tinted with iced tea. Tremendous sour tart taste bud impact. Quite a lovely experience. Words cannot do justice for the realness of these lambics. Puckering at times; makes its acerbic position well. Would love to drink this kind of beer all the time instead of that IPA or impy stout stuff. Dee-lish!  This is one impressive beer, it rocks!  Cannot detect any real bitterness in there except perhaps a touch of fresh squeezed grapefruit juice in the finish, very acceptable. Does not get tiring to the taste buds even thru this whole bottle.

Sampling notes:
Served lightly chilled in pilsner glass.
Capped and corked, nice pop upon opening. Clean golden apple-juice coloured body, very fine beading leading up to a small but dense white collar.
Sharp aroma, pungent, deeply complex. Plenty of tart apple cider upfront, vinegar undertones, hay, grapefruit pith, light horse character, faint floral notes.
Lean body, soft lively carbonation prickles the tongue, high acidity yet somehow not as brutal as its framboise/kriek counterparts.
Vinegar seems to hit home straight off, cider vinegar possibly, definately has that crisp new season granny smith acid bite about it. Citrus works its way in, grapefruit is obvious but lemon and lime seem somehow present, hint of honey and hay sweetens and otherwise bonedry mouthful. Really get the impression of a very young dry Semillon straight up, followed by some serious funk towards the finish, sweat, dough, yoghurt, herbal tea, slight hint of horsy stink as the lingering dryness leads on and on, letting me ponder what other adjectives I could use.
I think I actually enjoyed this more than its fruit-laden brothers, which is the opposite of what ive delt with this high-end lambics thus far. Deeply complex, sharp, dry, acidic, but id say its not too brutal for those who dare to venture.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

369,"2009-01-17",4.2,"Bottle at Tupalevs, courtesy of Walter, big thanks to both. Well, my first REAL Gueuze (St. Louis, you dont count), I was quite excited about this one. Pours out an interesting hazy straw gold with no head. The aroma is just out of this wolrd bizzare, but not in an offensive way, at least to me. Smells dank, Bretty, like diapers, yet it works? Flavour is equally bizzare but in different ways. Lemon lime burst on the palate right away before a quick fizzling out into some weird armpit/sweatsock characteristics, yet it works? Almost a tad fruity, buried underneath all the Brett, but I did get some peach out of it. Very big puckering effect. Drinks excessively well for what it is, though this is not at all an accessible beer to someone who has no idea what it is, or any experience with Brett, who can be a bit of a jerk if he doesnt know you well enough yet. Crazy acidic, yet it works? Smells like a diaper, yet it works? Drinkable but at the same time impossible to drink for some, yet it works? Inhibits characteristics that would otherwise mean terrible beer, yet it works? Awesome stuff. I wish I could get so much more in the way of Gueze, but the LCBO doesnt really believe in Lambics.

I was informed that this beer was not for sale by the bartender. He must have sensed that I really wanted some because he generously GAVE me a 3 or 4 oz sample about a half hour later. My rating came out exactly the same this time around, but I thought the beer was different enough to merit another rating.

That little bottle had quite a ride until it got to my belly in a home on a dirt road in North Florida.

This is an incredibly well balanced guezue with palate that is quite dry but not offensively so.  Smell is so subjective.  Either you love or it reminds you of a sheep pen.  I love but then I kind of like the smells of a barnyard so take that at what its worth.  

It poured a beautiful amber with a very tiny and quickly evaporating head.  

Its an amazing beer.  I was a little worried about how this bottle had fared on its long journey.  Fear not, pilgrim. It was just as tasty as it was when I drank a bottle in Antwerp a few years ago that had had a much shorter trip.

Its very strong, with powerful ripe barley; Im actually a little intimidated by this one. It smells pretty ripe. The liquid falls into the glass forming a cloudy light orange body and only a whispy head. After breathing for only a minute, it has calmed down quite a bit. The sourness is still pronounced, but now much fruitier and wooden in nature, more like something naturally sour rather than overripe. The flavor is actually more tame. Yes, its dry and sour, but delicately sweet and cheesy at the same time.  There is some pleasing citrus/lime quality, a thinly veiled oakiness, sharp cheese, and a shy vinous backdrop (think champagne). This is really well done in its subtlety.

The aroma of the beer was made up of crab apples, white grapes, honey, oak, light citrus, and also some funky yeast.  The flavor consisted of a mouth puckering sourness, followed up by apple, pear, white wine, earthy yeast, and some mild citrus notes.  The mouthfeel was light, crisp, and dry with mild carbonation.  Complex and enjoyable.  I cant wait to get some more!","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"

Very much that dry musty flavor or apricots at the end.  A perfect thirst quenching summer beer.  The sourness sits on the tongue and as it fades slowly, leaving behind apricot all over the tongue, you just crave it all over again.  There is even a bit of floral hops giving off just the slightest suggestion of bitterness, which plays wonderfully with the wood and sourness.  A very nice example of the style.

369,"2007-11-30",4.2,"25 oz bottle, Stateline Liquors, 2005 vintage.  Pours an almost perfectly clear golden yellow body under a fizzy one finger white head that faded pretty quickly to a whispy thin covering.  The nose is full-on cheesy, stinky feet funk with some notes of oak, apple cider vinegar, light sulfer and a little musty cork.  Sour, acetic, and tart citrus fruitiness grab you right off the bat, its bone dry and wonderful.  A dry oakiness and lingering apple cider vinegar finish. The classic Cantillon acidity runs things from beginning to end.  Mouthfeel is slightly dusty up front, but finishes with almost a light doughy stickiness.  Great pinpoint prickly carbonation.  Overall, Ive had this previously quite a few times and some bottles are certainly better than others, but you can always expect an authentic and high quality experience.

369,"2007-11-12",4.0,"I have often enjoyed this beer to satiate my sour urges, whether it be the in a 375mL bottle or a full 750mL. Whether it be the ""organic"" labels or the yellow labels, and I really love this beer.  However, I sit down to rate it now because I got to try it on tap for the first time ever.  It was a surprise at the Blind Tiger and I figure I would combine all the experiences here.  The tap poured very still with no head and no visible carbonation.  The aroma is very musky and barnyard with just a hint of the signature Cantillon sourness.  This is the first hint that this keg is younger than the bottles (or at least conditions much slower).  The bottles are usually a greater assault of sour and acidity on the nose. Taste, on tap, is again a subdued Cantillon with a vinegar-barnyard-musk.  The mouthfeel is very original with a needles in syrup thang going for it.  Only a faint signature Cantillon acidity presents itself and in its place is a leftover doughy yeatiness, which I never find in the bottles.  There is a bit more body and sweetness to this young gueuze, which I do not often find in the bottles.  Very nice to see the spectrum of the Cantillon gueuze.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

There is a sweet & sour thing going on, with green apple and grape skin sourness overwhelming an underlying sweetness.  It is also a little spicy at the end.  Lingering, acidic finish.

Certainly tastes more citrusy and more acidic than I would have thought; lots of lemons and lemon peels, musty yeast, wet hay, funky barnyard notes, light peppery notes, even some bitters towards the end.

369,"2007-09-12",4.0,"This is my second experience with gueuzes, and I must say my first, which was with the Lindemans, was better. Pours a transluscent gold with a thin head that fades to a swirl of white film above the transluscent elixir. The aroma brought forth wet hay, along with other fimiliar barnyard scents, leather, some peppery notes, and towards the end of each wiff, a bit a pear sweetness. The flavour is immediately tart fruits leading quickly into sour lemon and ending with a bitter lingering, which is mild when compared to the acidic bite. The citrus flavours are surprisingly refreshing. Layered behind these intense palate rapers are all those wonderfully filthy barnyard notes along with some oak and peppery funk. Still there is nothing in this beer that seems to cut the intensity of the acidity. The palate is delightfully round full and tingly and finishes rather clean and dry, pulling moisture from the sides of the tongue.

Aroma is oak, sour and yeasty. Taste is glorious, initially its like biting into a stick of rhubarb not that there is any rhubarb flavour but just for that great sharp crisp bite. Wonderful sourness and complex flavours such gentle carbonation as well, its fruity, its lemony its funky, fab beer.","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"

369,"2007-07-23",4.1,"(Bottled in 2005 - Labeled Classic Gueuze) Light tart aroma, with hints of green apples.  It pours a clear straw like color with a white head that fades to a ring and some dusting.  Very sour taste, with hints of oak and apples in it.  Very long tart finish, with a lightness on the palate.  A very nice gueuze, I really need to get my hands on some of these to have my wine drinking friends try.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","Nephilium"
369,"2007-07-22",4.1,"Bottle. Somewhat hazy but clearer in color than other gueuzes. Aroma is a blend of citrus and hops. Balanced sour flavor with good amount of carbonation. A dry finish with fruity notes; apples, I would say. Great gueuze.","FINLAND","Proteus"
369,"2007-07-20",3.7,"Bottle.  Aroma is a woody, dry vinegar, lightly sour and acidic.  Pours golden with an ephemeral whitish head that quickly disappears.  Medium sour taste, very dry and woody, not overpowering and mouth-puckering as expected.  Notably acidic, though.  Mediumish body, and bone dry throughout.  In this bottle, at least, the Gueuze is easy-drinking and relaxed, leaving a long, dry, gentle aftertaste, acidic, yes, but delicious!","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
369,"2007-07-19",4.0,"Pour is apricot orange.  A tepid surface.  Aroma of a wet dog sleeping in wet shed.  Rainwater and mildew covering them both.  Rose petals and lemon rafts amidst a sharp vinegar sting.  Foremost on the tongue is a surprisingly sweet cherry note, which slowly resigns itself to a more sour peach character.  Hint of animal fur and leather.  Even quieter are moments of sweet, oak wrought vanilla  somewhat misplaced.  A wet sawdust and biting balsamic aftertaste, slow to blossom.  Palate is quite resigned in sharpness, but pleasingly dry.  Very professional and a fantastically refreshing sipper.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

369,"2007-07-12",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 18, 2009 Sampled n my visit to the brewery.  All style molds are thrown out the window with these lambics - and man does the place smell wonderful.  While I consider these beers extremely unique and intriguing, they still require a lot of ""acquiring"" for me.  Cut throat tart and sour to wear it sinks its teeth into your cheeks and gums with no plans of leaving.  I really enjoyed this, but for whatever reason I still have trouble drinking lambics in excess as it gets to my stomach.","San Francisco, California, USA","jarspag"
369,"2007-07-12",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2009 [rated 7.12.07] My first non-flavored lambic.  Bengal orange pour with minimal frothy white head.  Smells like dusty rubber or something... very unique.   Never tasted anything like this...  very very sour I dont even know what else to say... wow.   Like battery acid.    Im not even sure how to rate this...   3.4.7.4.14

[rerate 07 cork 4.17.09] Well... it has been quite a journey since my first misguided rating of this beer.  375ml bottle labeled Classic Gueuze.  Pours a  slightly hazy orange with a small fine white dense froth on top.  I find it funny that I gave the aroma a 3 the first go around.  Strong gueze aroma, dusty, moldy, smells quite potent, sour and fairly sweet, some lemon.   Flavor is much more mild than I expected.  FUCK... I remember not even being able to swallow this 2 years ago... now its extremely tame.  Actually fairly sweet, tangy... maybe my last bottle was a more mature vintage for the time.  This is delicious, such a treat and widely available.  Supremely blended, very sour, could use some more acidity though, not extremely sharp, definitely needs to dry out a bit, light bitterness, faintly metallic, just a hint of stomach bile, fairly grainy actually.  Great body, medium mouthful, very soft fine carbonation, dry feeling.  8.4.8.4.16","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"
369,"2007-07-11",3.8,"I uncorked this and realized I may have it a little cold.  It pours bright orange with a cloudy covering of yeasty head.  The aroma, exquisite ... Id describe it as ""Mediterranean"" -- very acidic, almost olive oily.  This is definitely a sipper ... sharply vinegary, lemony, bready, juicy, sour, oily.  Finishes dry.

369,"2007-07-06",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 9, 2008 spettacolare, a quanto ne so un vero classico della gueuze, sicuramente tra le cose più curiose e preziose (curioso dirlo di una miscela di lambic) che io abbia mai assaggiato. La prima impressione fu piuttosto brusca, ma cè voluto poco per innamorarmi. 
Assaggiata per la prima volta allIrish di Quinto (6), poi comprate due bottiglie da 33cl per un aperitivo da Ciobì (6.50 - !! - per ognuna) e poi ribevuto al pub del Duca (6) in una splendida serata iniziata con una titanica pizza ai peperoni a Campomorone.

After a heavy tour passing stouts and IIPAs this was a wonder. Sourness of grapefruits made me ready for further investigation at the festival. It cleaned my mouth in the best way, you can imagine. Ill never forget it. Maybe I should sample it neutral one day, but I think Ill give it the same rating. From now on Im lost in Cantillon!!!","Odense, DENMARK","BeerBiker"
369,"2007-07-04",3.7,"Original notes lost.
Smells soapy, citrusy and bretty. Nice and complex aroma with hints of green apple peel. Slightly leathery.
The flavour is not as sour as I prefer, but its adequate. Theres a vague saltiness which gives it a little more body.
Hazy, warm yellow with some pale foam.
Its quite soapy and light, yet slightly viscous to the palate. Nice carbonation.
All in all a nice but pretty light gueuze.","Landskrona, SWEDEN","Veer"
369,"2007-07-02",3.0,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2007 750ml corked and capped bottle, recommending I drink it before 2030. On this evidence, I could have waited. Pours a dull, faintly misty gold with a creamy white head receding to a halo. Nose is sherbety and sharp, with notes of lemon rind and sodden barrelwood. Pungent, shuddering, sour apple gobstopper sourness beyond the cheapest, nastiest, bone-driest champagne or white wine Ive ever encountered. But none of the wood-tinged dankness or fustiness needed to make the acidity interesting. Once the glass has stood for 10mins, the acidity becomes almost unbearable...but still I keep lifting the glass. No choice really as the g/f has just tipped hers into mine. There is a fruitbowl of sour apple, lemon and tangerine flavours swirling around somewhere in there, but overwhelmed by a burning, gastric acidity. The reason why a beer this dominated by one-dimensional sourness is hailed as a complex classic continues to elude me. A beer that challenged my senses from first swig until last, but not a beer I enjoyed.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"
369,"2007-07-02",4.3,"From a 375mL Bottle, 2006 Bottling Date.  Pours a transparent honey gold color with shades of naval orange skins and a finger of rocky, brilliant white head.  Crisp, tart, brilliantly acidic, funky aroma of fermented lemon peels and under-ripe mango flesh.  A wave of pineapple skins, granny smith apples, and anjou pear served on a cracked wheat cracker with a healthy spread of chevre cheese.  Lovely balance of natural fruit aromas and funky acidity in that the funkiness adds complexity without completely dominating the fruity characters from the wild fermentation.  Light bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel with a crisp acidity.  The palate starts out with some crisp lemon and husky rhubarb stalks.  White oak and dusty leather pile on, fruits remaining.  A dusting of cracked white pepper and lactic fermentation cheese finish off the flavor brilliance.  Fantastic example of the style; I like my gueuze to have a prickling carbonation to enhance the biting acidity of the beer - this particular bottle doesnt have this quality although its not flat by any means.  Everything else is rock solid and absolutely gorgeous, leading me to expect sheer beauty from a bottle with a well conditioned sizzle.  I will certainly keep searching eagerly for that bottle...","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

369,"2007-06-24",3.1,"UPDATED: JUL 19, 2007 Bottle, from Kolding Vinhandel. Bio. Pours a hazy yellow-orange with a fine medium white head. Flavour is a little underwhelming, sour berries and vinegar.

369,"2007-06-10",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2013 Bottle. A hazy and sparkling medium blonde body, with a large, fizzy, mostly diminishing white head.

The flavor is lightly sweet, heavily acidic, very lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation, dry finish with light to moderate bitterness.

369,"2007-06-08",3.6,"750mL bottle, Botteld in 2.005 on the cork--mine is a yellow label with the silhouette of a guy drinking in a chair.  Pours a clear orange yellow with a one finger yellowish white head that fades to a film after a short time.  Aroma of very sour lemons, oak, white pepper, unripened pears, leather, hay, and even got a fair amount of sulfur (reminds me of smoke bombs on the 4th of July).  Damn this is tart--and then my mouth waters like a mofo.  This isnt acidic with a vinegar taste--moreso fruity like lemons.  Some hay and A tinge of fruity sweetness shows up for but a moment.  Otherwise, theres the light pepper and a little funk.  Dry finish.  Mild carbonation with a light body.  Pretty good, though I cant kill the whole bottle myself.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
369,"2007-06-07",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2008 Unclear yellow body, moderately carbonated, topped by a spritzy thin head, disappearing to a light ring, barely anything. Quite funky aroma, barnyard, hay, apple, slight sulphur, horse shit in the background, but in a good way of course. First sip is a blast of classic lambic funkiness. Assertive sourness, noticeable dry-out effect. Very rustic, almost unclean, character all around. Close to being flat. Mellow, woodsy feel, slightly tannic. I can see that this might be a less approachable example of the style, but delicious to me and has a lot of class.

Flavor is sourness bigtime upfront which leads to light fruits like apples and pears then leads to a straight belgian funky irony taste that can only be in a belgian open-fermented beer.

Brett funk is very earthy with notes of hay and horse sweat.  Appearance:  Golden orange in color and clear.  Head was small, white and rocky and didnt linger long.  Not much lacing.  Flavor:  A light touch of wheat and bready malt.  Sourness is right on the money and very well balanced.  Funk has some of the earthy/barnyard notes from the aroma, but seems more tilted towards the sweat side of the spectrum.  A light oakiness and a small taste of honey right before the finish. Very dry finish.   Palate:  Medium-light bodied.  Medium-high carbonation.  Overall:  Very tasty.

Medium body with some semi-sharp carbonation.  The flavor starts with alka-seltzer flavor, sharp citric presence, sour lactic, sharp clean spice, wild yeast, horseblanket and more - quite complex.

Light honey esters. Finishes in a salty cherry pit cascade. Enjoyable for it is a lambic that speaks of the wheat in the beer and the base ingredients.

Aroma of wheat, lemon, and that funky sweat quality so difficult to pin down.

This is indeed ""classic"" in regard to its lambic character. Light bodied, and tart up front. Just tart enough to put the fear of God into you before playfully backing off. Bone dry with some acidity, probably from the carbonation.

Pours a pale rose gold, lightly hazy, with a creamy white head that disappates into a thin film. Musty dry aroma is mostly sour, quite citrus, with woody, floral and yeast hints that remind of champagne. A touch of seetness is perceived in the mouth, at first, but thats quickly wiped out by a dry sourness, slightly tannic in the middle to finish, and then a big citric tang on the palate (reminiscent of licking 9v batteries).  Slight fruity note in the lingering citric/tannic finish. Soft carbonation, which is needed to allow the prickly acidity through. Definitely reminds me of a very dry champagne, with a sour edge.

Pale gold in color with the classic, fat-bubbled, white head with aggressive carbonation bubbles rising through the body.  Aroma is absolutely inundated with acetobacters that almost take your breath away like malt vinegar sprayed on fish&chips.  It is a challenge in itself and  is classic Cantillon aroma.  Besides that, there is some warmed honey, damp earth, and bubblegum.  Flavor is bracing.  It is tart enough to wake a person in a coma.

This is both annoying and exiting, like dating a dumb hot cheerleader.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Flavor was slightly of vinegar, and lemon.  very sour.  medium palate.  it was okay I became more accostom to it as i drank it.

Re-Rate 2008: Sampled at Cantillon after the tour:  the beer poured a hazy golden with a head that built up but then became small. aroma is striking musty, sour, with lots of funk, and some wood.  Flavor is incredible and very complex.  Lots of musty lemon, grapefruit, wood, brett, delicious, and amazing when sampled in the brewery because its aroma is present most of the way through the tour.  When drinking this after the brewery tour one feel like they are absorbing part of the 100+ year old traditions and essence of the brewery.

I was a little weary as I hated the Timmermans but, phew, this is great. Funny enough once poured looks exactly like Red Bull in the glass. Sour fruity aroma and taste, similar to champagne.

Beer 12 Summer 2006 trip in Europe.  Drank on 7/1/06 from the bottle at Cantillon.  After the tour I was able to sample Cantillons most recogized brew and I was impressed.  This is a very intriguing unique brew and is easy to drink and very complex in flavor.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"

Bringing the glass close and the sour orange and lemon nose comes although not too strong, this lets you know this will be a very nice gueze.  The flavor is tart and sour with the bubbling carbonation at the tip of the tongue and moving back to the center.  Oranges, oak, grapefruit, aciditicy and a little yeast balance well on the palate with out knocking you out with sourness like most guezes do.

Souring cannons blitz with turning limejuice, footed on a bank of molded sharp white cheddar bricks.  Wooden crates aromatically drip with compounded granny smiths, supercharged with bacteria.  Delectable flavor sours but doesnt surge over the top of the tart stratosphere.  Liquid moves all around with infected oak playing to expired, sharp grapefruit and limejuice extremes.  The tongue presses to the roof of the mouth, hoping to extract additional palate spawn.  Supple carbonation meanders through the prairie park equipment shed and clings to the aging fence posts, allowing callow lily juice to adhere to the solemnly splendid sour rind performance.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

369,"2006-08-11",3.2,"Organic Gueuze on tap at the Maproom.  Poured a slightly hazy, medium golden with virtually no head to cap it off.  Nose was distinctively barnyard in nature... dusty cobwebs in the corner of an old barn, horse, vinegar, lemon zest, and farmhouse cheese.  The flavor was just too acidic and sour for my liking (and I am usually a solid backer of Cantillon)... lemon, dust, and funky cheese for the most part.. but man was it sour (think drinking a small glass of pulpy orange juice after brushing your teeth with bright mint paste).

I ended up getting the North Sea shrimp, which looked like a plate full of mealworms but tasted much better.  The gueuze was still a good match.

Very funky aroma at first (leather, horseblanket, wet leaves, earth, whathaveyou), but it starts to get a little sweet as it warms.  Very acidic in the mouth.  I like a nice tart lambic, but this borders on vinegar to me.  As it settles and warms, it starts to lose a bit of the tartness (just a bit), and gets a bit thirst quenching and mouth watering.  A very nice quality in a lambic.  Downright citrusy by the end of the glass.  In my limited knowledge of the style, its a pretty good gueuze.","Windsor, Connecticut, USA","SwedeDog"

The aroma is spot on to what you would have guessed for a Cantillon Gueuze, lots of barnyard ""aromatics"" of the funked out wild yeast: a splash of citric acid, olde world cheese and a touch of grassy hop. The flavor palate was also classic gueuze, extreme tartness and acidic supported by a ever present yeasty overtone and a courtship of bitterness. Dry but not bone dry finish which let the woody tannin shine through. Really, the funk is not a dominate in the creation as some others in the genre have been. The mouth feel is spirited and light allowing the drinker to develop the depth of flavors, again while dry upon the finish it is hardly jaw-dropping. A solid gueze but I think I would prefer the offerings of Drie Fonteinen or the Lou Pepe version over this.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Its amazing how an aroma like that can actually be a pretty good thing. This has a great mouthfeel, thick and chewy, but not overly so. The taste has a big initial hit of grassy barnyard that quickly disolves into a big sour explosion. There is some dryness to the finish as well as a bit of puckering. Again, its funny how something like this canbe so good. Most normal people would think its terrible.

Smells like a muscat but not fruity, with cobwebs of dusty brett on the sides.  Acid in the flavor is like proseco and almost as dry.  The middle is like Munster cheese, kind of chewy.  Finish is long and slightly bitter, dry, with Brett strong on the back of the tongue.

369,"2006-06-12",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2009 Bottled in 2004. Call me a heretic, but this wasnt at the top of my list of favorite Gueuzes. Sure it was hard core, but I like my gueuzes a little softer than this, as this was almost straight up lambic feeling to me (except for the carbonation). The aroma was lots of citrus and light funk. Flavor was mostly citrus lemons, slight brett, not a ton of funk, and no cheese. Mouthfeel was carbonated with a medium to light body. Refreshing while cutting the grass (although, geez, this is an expensive way to cut the grass), but not my favorite gueuze. Re-rate, July 09: On draft at Monks Café (w/ their label on it) just ahead of the Phils / Pirates game w/ pop and bro-in-law - our Fathers Day present. This time through I didnt find this offensive at all, probably a function of having come along in drinking maturity these past three years.

369,"2006-04-06",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 9, 2006 What do you say to a beer with a label featuring the Mannequin Pis urinating off a dais, staring blankly into a glass of Lambic. Adds a little bit of humour and solidarity to this very unique tasting Gueuze, though it is still a little leftfield. Poured from the crowned-corked bottle into a flute glass. Clarity was excellent until the thick yeast pack dispersed halfway through pouring making the beer extra cloudy. Orange-gold in body with very, very fine carbonation failing to raise anything more than a film of white. In the aroma, yeasty, barnyard dust and musty, hessian-sack notes balance a tight, acidic, biting lemon and white-wine base to make for one of the most unusually intriguing wafts I have yet to smell. It also had a varnished pine note that I seemed to pick up after each sip. First mouthful was undeniably sour and adjustment was slow. Instantly reminded me of a Lemon Warhead©, a candy we get here that is intensely sour (keeps the kiddies amused!). it settles down into a more vinous mode favouring the flavours of a wooded chardonnay. A short stay on the tongue and the flavours intensify and bite at every corner of the mouth revealing tart white-wine, lemons, limes, alcohol (?), Alka-Seltzer (also?), pine-wood and a soft musty yeast note that lingers with some acidic fruits long after the swallow. Quite mellowing for a beer with little body and effervescence like vintage champagne; its increasingly addictive after just a few sips. One to track down again. Unique and refreshing!!!

Very tart citric fruit flavor, with a dry and sour finish. This could use a little more sweetness to round it out, but still very decent.

Very sour and carbonated, hints of vinegar.  Points for uniqueness but not necessarily enjoyment.

Very barnyard/hay, citrusy apple, enveloped by a superb dusty aroma leading to an astonishing complexity that gets unleashed in the mouth with a sustained carbonation that causes a riot of tartness, acidity and sweetness with no manifest dominance. If by now youre not yet smiling, the sharp astringency will take care of it. 

Recent examples (bio) of this appear to be a little restrained and even if they lack that complexity, they are still great ambassadors of the style and the brewery. Barnyard/dust and apple acidity. Great mouth fell and nice astringency and finish.

The aroma and flavor bring nostalgic suggestions of wondering the farm looking for trouble on a late summers day. Aromas of cut wet hay and lemon zests. The beer presents a mild flavor that reminds me of, but doesnt attack the palate as harshly as, biting into a glossy ripened cumquat. I find it a bit funky and barnyard like.  It is almost as if one can feel the layers of vintage blended Gueuze on the palate, with several different variations in texture and complexity.  A gentle proposal of oak and leather find a home in tart yet well-rounded bone-dry finish.

Starts with a juicy stone fruit sweetness then becomes nice and firmly tart (and quite acetic) without ever getting out of control, followed by a nice cheesy, stale hop bitterness. Apple cores, too. Carbonation seems caught between the clarity of flavours delivered by a flat lambic and the extra life brought by the high carbonation in other gueuzes, which kinda leaves the beer with neither of these positives.

Tangy aroma, reminds me somewhat of a dry powdered chemical compund that the janitors used to put down on the floor to dry up vomit. A bit of ctric acidness mellows it a bit. Flavor is overwhelming sour. Just as imperial IPAs have stretched the boundaries on bitterness, it seems this style (even though it has been around for hundreds of years) just tries to make itself as sour as possible. No fruit to salvage it here like in Lambics. As sour as can be, which is what Im sure it is trying to aim at, so it is true to style and appreciated, just not my cup of tea.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"

Clear golden body, looks like a deceptive pale lager.  The lack of fizz doesnt translate to a lack of aroma.  Assertive burnt grapefruit / lactic acid with a benign sugar-cookie sweet malt hiding in the background.  The flavor is refreshing (its 82F and humid in my apartment, the tartness is welcome) and challenging at the same time.  Tart grapefruit peel, iron, strawberry leaf,  ""sour"" all over a now cowering pale malt.

Initially, the sour, acidic, almost vinegar-like smell overwhelms everything else. Slowly, cinnamon, leather, horse and lemon peel begin to show through. Very spicy, and just incredibly funky. Intensely sour flavors. Dry, astringent palate. Not sure what to make of this. Its weird aggresive stuff, like a brut champagne, but dryer still. Initially, I didnt like it very much. But as I sip through the bottle, it grows on me. (With the wild assortment of bacteria and yeast in here, its probably growing inside me too.) An expanding experience for my palate.

The first whiff from the bottle as I uncork it is just overloaded with tartness.  Aroma is quite sour with hints of lemon, sour grass, citrus, barnyard, dust, sour yeast, spicy pepper, sour peach, grapefruit rind, and some old wet oak.  The aroma is just filled with sourness, but somehow it still remains light.  When I take my first taste the tartness just completely overwhelms my palate and I have to take a break before I can go back for more.  I can taste potent sour lemons, tart wheat, grass clippings, acidic dried leaves, leather, barnyard, bread dough, stale hops, sour apples, mild peaches, and spicy yeast.  Finishes tart and dry, almost hurting the tongue with its sourness.  Later this changes to a sweet, slick coating all over the mouth tasting of fermented apples, lemon, sugary tea, and sour orange rind, finally finishing with notes of a white wine or sherry soaked aged wood and cinnamon.  This aftertaste just goes on for a long time.  Light to medium bodied, with an amazing creamy, smooth, and velvety mouth feel, and medium carbonation.

Bitter, tard and sourness beyond my capacity to appreciate, as good as it smells and looks, this beer is for the upper echelon of experts only.  I will gladly try this one again in a few years. Unripe bleuberries and alcohol, old grapes hint towards a biere de gqarde, in the traditional sense. This Geuze is noted to be kept beyond 2030, an amazing figure. Smells of of old unripe grapes, the acidity and tartness that ensures when biting on an unripe grape is litterally felt in the brew, just as the gambrinus Rosee of the same company, but less acidic to the nose.Playfully suspended yeast in this not quite translucent, orange-golden brew. The head is ethereal and dissipates very quickly, rising very thinly.Incredibly tart and sour beer. So much so its distracting and takes away from the old barrel-fermented flavors. The hops is very present for a gueuze. This beer, and the whole line from Cantillon is a very acquired taste. As much as I thought I knew about beer, this beer took me back and showed be a whole new world of tastes. So strrong it can wake the dead.Metallic finish to a small degree. I think it grows stronger and less tart with age, I would be MORE then wiling to age one bottle, should I ever be graced with one. After all this brewery only produces 700 hectoliters annually.

Ok, its not that extreme, but it sure is funky.  Band-aid phenols, pure, concentrated brett and light vinegar.  Its not moldy/cheesy smelling as much as it is dry and sharp smelling of yeast, dry leather, rich, oily tannins and acidic sourness.  The intensity of the aroma is second to none, as well.The beer looks perfect, with a wit-bier like appearance, cloudy yet brilliantly colored (pale gold, straw yellow and light copper tinges all swirl about).  White head sticks around, laying in clumps as it recedes.Flavor wise, this beer is difficult to prepare for.  Pure unadulterated tartness washes over the palate, sticky dough, and plenty of acid coats the mouth.  Perhaps the strangest phenomenon, is the way the acid attacks my teeth, much like eating a raw lemon.  I can only drink it a mouthfeel at a time and only after pausing to let my palate recover from the extreme sourness and tartness of it.  Finish shows great potential to come, with emergent notes of light cheese (camembert/brie type notes), light wood and earth notes and a touch of sweetness.  After letting my bottle breath and serving in a tumbler, the carbonation was perfect; it wasnt sharp or prickly, but was far from flat.  For me, this was mind-blowing stuff.  I dont know what it is, but this floored me.  I kept trying to get that effect from the Girardin Black Label, but it didnt do it.  I think I still have a lot to learn about the subtleties of gueuze, but I cant help loving this stuff right now.  Im betting that with age, the extreme acid attack mellows somewhat.  Ill test that prediction when I sample Bucknakeds 1996 bottle.Yep, the 1996 is about as good as it gets.  The aroma has mellowed out and softened a good deal, with tons of dryness working its way in.  Barnyard funk is there, of course, but not in your face.  Flavor is magnificent though.  Is this oxidized?  I sure couldnt tell.  The effects of age have done nothing bad to it.  Would drink this every day.Draught at Redbones October 2005.  Brett is more pungent/apparent.  Funk and mold and cheese in the aroma of course.  Not nearly as sour/acidic in flavor.  Much easier drinking.  But during the ballgame, I aint complainin.  Good lacing, seems cleaner in flavor.  Brett really wipes the palate clean after each sip.  Reminds me more of drie fonteinen.2004 bottle  Incredibly funky, barny aroma with light sulphur and tons of tartness.  Flavor is rustic, sour, tart, woody and dry.  I think the flavor and aroma are as good or better than any vintage, but the mouthfeel seems a little bit looser than the 2003.  No need to make any quick judgements though, time will be a better judge.2006 bottleDelicious as always, nice to know some things dont get worse over the years.  Reserved sourness, but still nice and tart.  Lots of lacto and plenty of fresh brett.  Sulphur, rubber, its all here.  Great texture, not as loose as the 2004 and 2005.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

369,"2004-12-13",3.0,"Purchased at Greens on Buford Hwy.  After pouring a thin head forms over the surface of the gueuze but disspates entires within seconds.  The color is a lightly cloudy orange gold.  Aroma is of strong barnyard (a quality I normally enjoy, but here it is a bit overpowering for my taste), sour cherry, apple,  and evergreen.  On the pallette the sourness hits first with a little carbonation.  The lemony apple tartness gives way to a slight (hoppy) dandelion taste on the sides of the toungue with the horseblanket coming back around in the finish, very dry throughout.  Tart and musty sums this experience up for me.  My first gueuze, not very enjoyable, but not a bad product either.  Will try again","Chicago, Illinois, USA","damienv10"

369,"2004-10-25",4.1,"Vintage 2002: Small bottle.  A mellow gueuze for certain. The most beautiful gueuze Ive ever poured. Light hazy flax with a reslilient foamy white head that mounts up like vesuvius. Massive and lovely. Nose is interesting. Green apple, oak and only a slight tinge of bretts. Very sour (lactic) and yet not very ""hot"" with bretts. No crackling fried pork smells, no hazy hot yeastiness, very mellow and subtle. I kind of like that. Flavors also reflect this. The horseblanket has really been put away on this one it is replaced with an overt green apple tartness and a hazy, dignified oakiness. The oak is beautifully round and intensely subtle. Exquisitely dry. The oak really contributes to this. Aftertaste is pungently apple-like. Grannysmith would be proud! At first this was sort of a dissapointment. As I sink my teeth into it it really impresses me. Not as good as the Lou Pepe for certain but a Damn Fine Gueuze.

369,"2004-05-21",4.0,"Purchased in a 12 oz. green bottle which was adorned with black foil neck wrapping.   Uncapping the bottle revealed a cork underneath, which seems to be a standard for Belgian premium beers.  The pour into a tumbler was a cloudy peachy orange color with an initial fizz of carbonation that disappeared very quickly.  The aroma was very unique.  Its hard to put into words what this beer smells like, but Ill try anyway.  I could detect wet grass, sour apples, green onions, and pickled vegetables.  As weird as it may sound, the smells actually got my mouth watering.  The taste is also extremely unique.  The beer exhibits a mouth puckering vinegary sourness at first sip.  The sourness is accompanied by a peppery spiciness and a hint of bitterness.   There is no sweetness to balance these tastes out, but sweet drinks are for babies any way.  As the beer warms, it gets a bit creamier on the palette, tempering the astringency.  The 5% ABV is so far down the radar, it slips past the tongue and only shows up as a warming sensation in the belly.  This is a light and refreshing traditional gueuze, which should be enjoyable in the upcoming summer months.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Big horsey smell when I finally got the slightly moldy cork out of the bottle. Kicked up a big foamy head when I poured it, that quickly subsided as I set up some crackers and blue cheese. Appearance is just like a pilsner, yet somehow more pleasing. That original smell went away, too. Taste combines aspects of a dry champagne and a sour grape juice. Sourness is not distracting, rather, allows more subtle traces of fruits. Cant pick up too much malts or hops, but color is like a good French farmhouse ale.

Substantial airiness carries the delicate flowers and haylike malt whispers along with a touch of honey sweetness and the signature peppery Cantillon yeast. First sip is gritty and spritzy, quickly turning creamy. Opens with sharp iron and dried apricot flavors underpinned by grass, honeydew, and flower petals. Light suggestions of lemon zest. Late burst of chewy brett accompanies the delicate hay and peppery yeast notes before a firm, puckering tartness takes effect. Finishes decadently musty and dry as a bone, as expected, while the brett and pale malts take a backseat to the wood and yeast remnants.

369,"2004-01-14",4.5,"Bottle of 1997 vintage.
My first Cantillon Gueuze, but not my first lambic.

Appearance is slightly cloudy, very effervescent with a huge creamy white head that recedes quickly into a thin layer of foam.  No lace on the glass to speak of.  The color is a pleasing honey golden hue, like sunshine in a glass--it's snowy here in Montana so you've gotta take what you can get!

The aroma hits you from several feet away--sharp, acidic, and puckery--like alum or lime juice.  There's a mustiness that reminds me of cobwebs and Dracula's castle--as though the beer spent a hundred years buried in a castle wine cellar somewhere.

The first taste is like no other I've ever had--really overwhelmingly sour--imagine drinking lime juice and that's sort of similar.  I cringed when it hit the back of my mouth--I've had lambics before, but this is much more sour--imagine a lime lambic maybe without sugar to sweeten it.  The sourness wakes you up and the mustiness sort of smoothes the edges a bit.  The gueuze gets easier to drink after a couple of swallows.

If you've never had this beer before, I would say it should be on your must have list.  You might not like it, but If you have the chance to drink it and pass it up, you've missed out on one helluva unique beer.","Billings, Montana, USA","wulfhere"

Im not sure I can even begin to describe all the aromas and flavors, horseblanket and sour  doesnt even come close to doing it justice.  Just so much going on.

With ageing however, the flavour develops to be less sharp and gains some complexity.

369,"2003-08-13",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 30, 2004 Cork date of 2001, Sampled November 2004
Pours a brilliantly clear copper orange color.  It is topped by a frothy light tan head, that is held up by a light but persistent carbonation.  Ah, the aroma is simply magnificent.  In the nose I get notes of lemon, grapefruit, an astringent woodiness, musty leather, vinegar, citric acid, a hint of ripe cheese, lemon zest, and hay.

The beer is creamy up front, but quickly moves to a bracing hit of sharp acidity that lingers through to the finish.  I get lots of notes of grapefruit up front, and the finish has an austere dry, mouth coating, tannic astringency which helps to balance the citrus character.  It is almost like chewing on a old piece of formerly musty but now dry leather, ooh how pleasant that sounds.

It is amazing how much one can get used to things, I hardly even notice the acidity in a traditional Lambic anymore.
Sampled 2001This one is quite sour smelling.  There is lots of acidity (one of the harder gueuzes out there) and tastes of grapefruit.  Well carbonated and has a woody finish, that is accompanied by a light bitterness.  Though quite sour this beer still manages to be well balanced with lots of different things going on.  A good traditional example of this style.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
369,"2003-08-04",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2006 An almost nonexistent, wispy white head reveals the near-still qualities of this hazy, golden-straw hued brew.  Upon assaulting the glass with my nose for the first time, I quickly realized that this is the absolute dankest, most pungent and vivid gueuze Ive ever encountered.  Yes, even barnyard-laden Hanssens Oude Gueuze would cry in shame before this monstrosity.  Simply put, this is an Imperial level of funk.  (True believers, ignore that last comment.)  Across the boardpungent barnyard, medicinal esters, band-aid phenols, sweat, dust, vinegar...all of the nasties are present in full force.  Beyond that, softer elements of hay and alfalfa provide a nimble base while hints of lemon rind tug the aroma about.  As it warms, a concentrated doughy center emerges along with a semi-bright overripe tropical fruit element.  The flavor is assertively sour throughout, owing much of that to pervasive grapefruit, lemon and lime citric tones.  Dough and straw are displayed at the forefront with the funky stuff coming on strong from mid-palate to the end of the aggressively dry and lengthy finish.  Despite the level of funktitude, there is quite a malt body present, and it seems to grow as the beer warms.  The body is rather reedy and carbonation minimal (there looked to be a bit of cork leakage), so, combined with the still oily texture the total mouthfeel comes off much closer to an unblended lambic rather than a traditional gueuze.  I dont think Ive ever referred to a beer as a food-beer before (similar to a food-wine), but this might be one for the books.  The thought of most any shellfish is terrifically appealing at this point, alas, I have none.  Still, this one goes down the gullet to mark my acceptance into a Masters program...so, cheers to me!  75cL bottle, Burgundy glass, 1996 vintage.  I dont enter ratings based on terribly old vintages (hence, my original numbers stand for now) but, for anyone that actually reads this and happens upon a 1996 bottle, Id give it a 10/4/9/4/19=4.6Old rating (8/4/8/4/17=4.1): 75 cL bottle, wine glass.  Fifth bottling, October 2000.  Deep, rich orange body is cloudy from tiny, dense particles.  Large, dense, frothy head diminishes quickly.  Powerful horseblanket / barnyard yeast aroma.  Grainy malts.  Some vinegar and dry wine aromas are present.  Lonts of delicious stench abounds.  Moderately sweet start turns into moderately acidic, puckeringly sour finish of long duration.  The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth.  The body is medium and oily.  Seems to be slightly less complex than Hannsens.  The bottom line is: theres lots of beautiful nastiness here.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

Hazy golden yellow body with a small foamy white head. 3+ Aroma is milder than I recall from previous samples, lemon seeds, musty dusty malt, it gains complexity as you go on. 7+ Flavour is sharply sour at first but subsequent sips are far more drinkable. Dramatically so in comparison to my past encounters with this beer. Lemon seed and a moderate sourness by Cantillon standards. Very light fun. Lemon accents in the finish are refreshing at times. 7+ Average palate. I found this surprisingly easy to drink for a beer I have previously described as pickle juice. Have I mastered my nemesis, or has it slowly beaten me into submission?!? 7+/3+/7+/3/16+ = 3.6+ Bottle at Cantillon, BrusselsSeptember 2006 Brewnosers Meeting, bottle at least a year old. Hazy yellow body with a small white head. Massively funky aroma, horseblanket. Powerfully sour acidity up front hints at lemons. Grows on me a little bit as the glass goes on, but I wouldnt want a whole bottle to my self. Average palate, effervescent. I have had a few unrated samples over the years, but this is slowly growing on me, but it is still a far cry from the complexity and drinkability of others. 6+/3/6+/3/14 - 3.3  
July 2003 Girlfriend brought me back a bottle from the brewery. Golden color,no head. Sour in the aroma and the aftertaste which lingers. Girlfriend really likes it. Me, not so much. Definitely a classic and worth trying though. 4/3/4/3/10 - 2.4","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"

369,"2003-07-04",4.5,"Bottled in 2002.  I had this side-by-side as an apertif with the Mort Subite gueuze, and while the comparison was favorable to the Cantillon, these were moderately different experiences.  For one, the Cantillon poured murkier and lighter in color.  While my glass kept a trace of head, and overall seemed to have more carbonation supporting it, it also flattened out a bit as well.  The aroma was more pure--barnyard and mold, for sure, with an ugly attractiveness.  Funny, I found similarly musty, cellared aromas tonight with the wine I had at dinner, one a 1998 St. Veran Chanson and another a 1996 Ochoa Tempranillo Garnache Tinot, though both of those didn't continue the vein into their dry flavors.  My friend Simon, with whom I have shared many good beers (from Abbaye des Rocs to Traquair Jacobite Ale) was, for the first time, repulsed by this beer.  ""Strained through an old man's socks"" was his expression.  Nevertheless, I didn't find the sourness and acidity so difficult to adjust to (compared to the Cantillon Kriek).  Nice strains of citric, very fresh lemon juice flavors.  Late bitterness under the jowels seemed to mark the end of the progression of senses and flavors that I got with each sip.  By the end, this was delightfully drinkable.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

I like moderate lambics, with the sour/barnyard notes in balance with malt or fruit or whatever (something half-way between this and Lindemans).  This beer is definitely at the extreme end of the sour/barnyard range.    I've tried several of Cantillon's styles, and they all have the same signature barnyard/sour/enteric/horsey characteristics. The sample I had was relatively young - 2001 - but I still think this beer is best left to the true lambic enthusiasts, as opposed to people like me who like a mild one now and again.  I realize this is a classic, if extreme, example of the style, so my rating reflects my personal tastes to a strong degree.","Boone, North Carolina, USA","Brodie"

Notably tart flavor, with some astringency in the finish and mild chest warming.  Fruitiness less apparent in the mouth than in the nose.  Could use a tad more carbonation, becomes borderline cloying, losing the refreshing edge this beer should have.

Nose is fantastic: barnyard, leather, stale cheddar, vinegar, rubber bads and bandaids.  This is by far one of the best brews I have yet to encounter.  Starts nice and perky.  Assertive sourness all the way through.  Creamy texture. Every sip yields to another flavor, unexplainably complex.  I dont want to spoil it, so get this one for yourself!

The taste offered an acidic battle of the tongue and cheek. Flavors of lemon and peach dominate with acidic citrus creating a beautiful souring finish. A bit rougher in the finish than the Oud Beersel tried earlier, but still this was a very respectible brew. Oak flavors also begin to come out as this one warms.

When cork was about halfway out we heard the hissing and rushed it over to the sink to protect the floor. Right about the time I got it to the sink the cork shot out (attached to one of those big cork screws with the handles to make it easier to get the cork out) and it hit the ceiling.Im just glad I had it aimed straight up and not towards my head or the window. The head was huge but faded quickly and unevenly. The scoring in the bottom of the glass left a thick column of tiny bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass so the head never completely went away. The smell was a bit musty with an aroma I have noticed with many darker belgian ales, especially the La Trappe Dubbel and Quadrupel. I had thought that until recently it was candy sugar, but Im not sure if thats what it is since I dont know if its used in this beer. In the flavor, the beginning is some maltiness, mustiness and a few other flavors I dont recognize. The finish is sour and a fairly lengthy aftertaste is also sour. The sourness is the largest part of the flavor profile but not as much as I had been led to believe. A very interesting experience, but it was a little difficult to drink more than a glass.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

369,"2002-06-20",3.9,"Drank with the family in the brewery while watching the World Cup. Fabulous, you can almost taste the history and funkiness of the brewery while you drink the beer. As they told us, Beer is meant to be acid, it should not be sweet! The flavors of this one are a great mix of sourness and acidiy without being overpowering. I really enjoyed this lambic.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Jake Barnes"
369,"2002-05-22",3.2,"Draught version.
Cloudy orange brown with a hint of red. Thin white head. Sour youghurtlike aroma. The flavor is sourcream like with hints of chives and bluecheese. Sourish finish. A middle of the road benchmark gueze","Solna Stockholm, SWEDEN","DrBeer"
369,"2002-05-06",4.6,"The only gueuze that is still brewed in Brussels.Extremely acidic..I LOVE it, I agree its not the most balanced of gueuze,but hard to find and worth the price","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","dirtymike"
369,"2002-05-03",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2003 Aroma has sulphur, grass, citrus, apple and oak. 
The apple and oak I found in the taste is dominated by an overpowering sourness. Dry mouthfeel. For experienced beer drinkers only. 
Vintage 2002: geuze-lambic bio. Fairly light color. Overwhelming aroma of sulphur, ctrus, oak, honey and cheese. Harsh sulphury sourness. Citrus, oak vanilla and apple in the flavor. Some vinegar and hops. Delicious and very complex geuze. Young and a bit harsh, but will ease down and get even more complex in a few years. Great beer!","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
369,"2002-04-30",4.0,"Served form tap. Pale amber coloured, hazy. Acidic nose. Tart, champagne like. Refreshing and complex. th edruaght version appears more mellow than the bottled.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
369,"2002-04-20",4.4,"one awesome lambic...the champagne characteristics are there in the aroma...the most tart beer ive ever tasted. yet it doesnt leave a sour taste on the palate....awesome!","Davenport, Iowa, USA","igneous1"
369,"2002-04-10",4.4,"On tap, Toronado (SF). I havent had this in many many years and this is much better than I remember it... You never cross the same beer twice. Beautiful headless grapefruit and golden color. Served less than 48°F Cloudy but no yeast bodies unlike most bottles Ive seen. Lively grapefruit and cider with sweet tart feel that doesnt command a pucker. Fairly tame -- I was expecting something much wilder. Now at the bottom of the glass Im certain I could drink 10 more.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
369,"2002-03-03",2.9,"I wanted to like this. I shoulda waited for a hot August day to try it...Very champagne like presentation out of the bottle except for the foamy persistence of the head. Winey, cidery, yogurty lactic aroma. Odd color seemingly golden at the top and more yellow at the bottom...an illusion? Very sour, grapefruity tart, not what I think of as beer. Ive had gueuze before but not this one. I thought I was ready for Cantillons gueuze but better stick to their fruit lambics from now on. Rating is out of respect, I didnt really enjoy this that much...didnt note great complexity, overwhelmed by tartness. After drinking it, I still wanted a beer.","Illinois, USA","DavefromChicago"

Probably the best cult beer in the world!

Really Great!!!","Vaasa, FINLAND","pete.nuutinen"
369,"2002-02-06",4.1,"Very nice and relatively persistant off-white head of foam over a typical, cloudy amber brew, with quite lively and very fine bubbles.
Subdued but typical gueuze aromas, barnyard, yeasty and cheesy aromas of adequate but not great intensity.
Very fine lacy mouthfoam, sour and of rather light intensity, with slight silkiness, clean and of good quality.
Rather light-bodied and not extremely long in the mouth, but fine and satisfying.
A very fine gueuze, quite civilized yet sour character.  I would say this one does not score in barnyard ecological as much as in the field of fine character, which is a meant to be a compliment in another sense!","Sterrebeek, BELGIUM","Belgik"
369,"2002-02-05",4.6,"I like lambic beer and I really enjoyed this.  Sour and acidic, so if you dont like these qualities then you wont like this.  Cloudy and yeasty, winelike, but it does not taste like wine per se, as some claim.  Overall, just delicious!  Will buy again.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
369,"2002-01-18",4.4,"this was great,the nose was woody,fruity,musty,it was golden,and cloudy in apperence,great flavor sour,tart,kind of like bitting into a grape seed very refreshingwith a dry finish","liverpool, New York, USA","hairy"
369,"2002-01-05",4.1,"A cloudy yellow, lots of fiz. Some head collapse but persistent. I love the aroma, I dont know what it is but makes my mouth water. Sour, fruity aromas that are immense. Acidic, tart,oak stands out.  Sour green apple flavors come out as well. Drying at first but becomes very juicy. Smooth, sharp and one hell of a body. Great stuff.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
369,"2001-12-18",4.7,"Here is a beer I havent been able to find for two years, yet I caught myself tasting it the other day after two years without...talk about finish.  Arguably one of the top Lambics.  A biting sour like a lemon with teeth.  This is a beer which makes a pipe smoker buck up.  Yet all exxageration aside, (though I am serious about tasting it two years after the fact)I am sipping it again now and I find it though tart quite round and smooth, bodied and oak flavoured.  A first rate Lambic!","taichung taiwan, TAIWAN","danich99"
369,"2001-11-07",3.5,"I wanted to like this more than I did.  It was definitely very complex, but the acidity really took a lot away from my ability to enjoy drinking this.  That said it was decent chasing a bowl of mussels down the hatch.  Better with food.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
