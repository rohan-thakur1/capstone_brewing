3290,"2016-09-04",3.9,"From tap, it is a clean, clear bronze with a carefully fashioned pillow of cream colored foam. The aroma is citric, herbal, and earthy, showing hints of mint, lemon zest and lemon thyme in addition to sourdough crust and iron; theres a faintness to it, or a lack of effusiveness, and a wet carpet like yeast muddle that colors things somewhat. But its minerallic flavors and citric tang are extremely attractive, becoming a muse, ultimately demanding helpless returns. The malt structure is firm enough, if somewhat wooden or even papery at times; it seems certain that at one point it was sumptuously nutty and honeyed.  Perfectly fulsome while cracklingly brisk. This version seems to fall in the middle of this lagers range of possibilities; given this, its quite excellent.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

3290,"2016-01-11",3.2,"A notable Kellerbier for its almost extreme bitterness. Fresh grain-sack malt nose with some whiffs of buttery diacetyl. A harsh bitterness that builds fairly quickly, making for a distinctive experience but poor drinkability. I found the bitter hop residue a bit sticky on the tongue, and building. Unrefined. But I cant say Id want them to change a thing. It stands out and Id travel back just to show someone else how different these beers can be.

3290,"2013-12-13",4.0,"Multiple liters vom fass at Knoblach in Dec. 2013: Slightly hazy orangish golden. Broken, tiny-bubbled white foam. Brightly fruity aromas mix with honey-drizzled toasted hay, wood-root-spice hops, herbs, piecrust, fresh bread, and minerals to comprise the mellow but refined nose. Soft prickles of subdued carbonation. Crunchy, nutty and malty, with toffee and oodles of toasted hay richness dovetailing with candyish, woody, deeply herbal bitterness. Potently grassy and herbal, throughout. Depth-lending residual sugars are beautifully tempered by the saliva-inducing minerals. Crisp notes of piecrust also help offset the sweetness and add to the elaborate maltiness. What it lacks in hop flavor is perfectly compensated by a succulent medley of fruity esters which support the stiff, salty, licorice-charged bitterness. Savory punch of hard lemon candy in there, as well. Continually richly malty and sturdy with profuse honey, toast, and lush hay notes at the finish, which is adorned with a captivatingly forceful zing of staunch bitterness. A ridiculously clean and bitter beer which stretches the boundaries of what is widely accepted as standard hopping rates in the region. Nearly impossible to stop drinking. Certainly rivals, if not surpasses, the exquisite hoppiness of Witzgall Landbier and Roppelt Kellerbier (when they are ""on"", that is), two of Franconias hoppiest.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

3290,"2013-11-29",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 4, 2015 Vom fass at the brewery in Schammelsdorf many times over the years, and at the FrankenBierFest in Rome in March 2015, when it was in absolutely stunning shape and stole the show (along with the Knoblach Fastentrunk). First impression: uncharacteristically hoppy Franconian lagerbier.
Green, grassy, lemon pithy / citrus Spalt hops. Incredibly rich and full maltiness with immense depth, suggesting toffee and baked bread and nutty pastries.  Its lip-smacking and bitter and sweet and demands gulps. Ive had duds before, yeasty and doughy and smelling of autolyzed yeast, but when its on it is hands-down one of the finest beers in the world and shows Michael Knoblach to be one of the best brewers in the world.  As for the score, Ive had this so many times, and like any Franconian beer it varies.  Ive had yeasty-muddy glasses that were difficult to finish (not bad due to fermentation or recipe but because the barrel was turbid), and Ive had exceptional barrels where Im convinced its one of the best 10 beers of my life.  Most glasses are in-between those two extremes, where the malt is lip smacking and savory and filling while the hops are sticky bitter and citric.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

3290,"2011-08-01",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 12, 2017 My Bottom Line :  
Quite herbal and peppery, this unfiltered blond lagers hop character thrives in a cushy, effervescent mouthfeel, slowly building a lovely spicy, bitter finish. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A creamy head of foam recedes to a veil in the krug. 
-The bitterness is refreshing and fits perfectly with the crisp mouthfeel. 
-Malts give some support, but this is mostly a noble hop showcase. 
-Drinkability is extremely high. The natural carbonation and svelte body, coupled with the engaging hop presence, make this poundable for any hop lover.
-A 2017 pint from the gravity barrel was very bitter and quite rustic.
