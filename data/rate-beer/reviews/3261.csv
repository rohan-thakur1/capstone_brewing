3261,"2017-03-05",4.5,"Quel bel hommage québécois aux triples dabbaye belges avec cette buteuse de la brasserie Le Trou du Diable. Les codes du genre sont scrupuleusement respectés, avec une bière tout en équilibre entre malt, houblon et alcool, et entre rondeur et puissance sur des arômes fruités et épicés. De couleur ambrée en verre (EBC de 30 environ), cette triple, limpide présente une multitude de très fines bulles et une mousse blanche dun centimètre dépaisseur. Le nez est splendide et dun équilibre splendieux. Céréales, miel, banane, coriandre et une pointe citronnée sassemblent avec en laissant sexprimer à la fois le malt et le houblon. A la dégustation, lattaque est fruitée et fraîche avec des arômes de pêche, poire et banane. Des notes poivrées permettent quant à elles de procurer un peu de peps et du relief à lensemble.La deuxième bouche soriente sur le malt et des arômes de miel, de pomme et de poire. Le sucre est très présent, donnant de la rondeur voire de lourdeur à cette triple, mais heureusement larrière bouche sur lamertume et les épices permettent de conférer un peu de légèreté. Lamertume devient plus franche en troisième bouche. Celle-ci dune intensité modérée est bien maîtrisée et sur une belle alliance avec lalcool. Les 10 % Abv se sentent peu, la cause à un sucre très présent. Le final sera dune longueur modérée. Lamertume y est cependant un peu plus saillante, sur des notes poivrées et des touches de genièvre. Un final un peu plus enlevé et long aurait été appréciable, mais lalcool et les arômes, un peu anesthésiés par le sucre, ne le permettent pas. Mais ces québécois ont de façon certaine des aïeux belges pour avoir donner à cette belle triple digne des Saint Feuillien ou Watou Triple.","FRANCE","jybi"

NOS : piwo emanuje aromatem biszkopta i typowych estrów belgijskich, przede wszystkim morela. Do tego mocne aromaty skórki cytryny, ciasta imbirowego i subtelne aromaty przypraw takich jak kardamon, kurkuma i szafran. Rozpuszczalnik.

USTA : piwo jest średnio gazowane i tłuste. 
Słodkie o mocnym smaku ciasta imbirowego z przyprawami i podkreślonych nutach moreli i owoców z puszki. Alkohol jest wyczuwalny ale nie czuć tych 10%. Gorzkość delikatna i mocno zdominowana.

3261,"2012-08-10",3.2,"On draft at Rustico in Alexandria, VA.

Full pour shared between me, Paul & Mike.

The beer appears a hazy, golden orange hue with a finger of head. As the head recedes, it leaves some good lacing in its wake. The aroma brings a heavy dose of spices and alcohol, followed by more subtle notes of yeast and citrus. The flavor is bold and forward - this is a big beer. The taste is decent, but I would guess / hope that spending a few years in the cellar would serve to improve this brew. As this was sampled on draft, that obviously wasnt an option at the time. In general, I found the beer to be a bit too hot, with flavors sort of running together, lacking cohesion. Id be interested to try the barrel-aged version, though at $30 per bottle, I dont imagine its worth it.

Pours a moderately-hazy golden color with a thin white head. The nose is really powerful and sends characteristics in all directions. There is some strong banana and clove plus loads of yeast spice. All of these components are quite strong and do not meld together very well. The same goes for the flavor, which dials things back a bit, but still isnt terribly pleasant. Spice, banana, light fruit, and some mild grain come together to present a final package that lacks coherence. Medium body with good carbonation. Okay, but not something Id look for again.

Light lacing ensues.Tremendously interesting yeast here!  I dont know what they used or how they fermented it, but its full of lovely esters and strong phenols, without being tacky or dominant (ie. its not a banana/clove bomb, nor do the phenols over-dry the nose/flavor).  Gives the effect of it being spiced with a variety of things, though I highly doubt there are any spices in it.  Notes of light vanilla, ginger, white pepper, tangerine juice and a tasteful amount of nectarine/peach esters fill this vivid aroma, with soft, well-attenuated pale malt sugars lying gently behind.  Terrifically balanced and with no sign of alcohol or flaw, I dont see any way for the flavor to not be as good.And Im not disappointed as a tight carbonation spreads spicy esters and light hops all over the palate, only to further dust it with a layer of honey-vanilla-like maltiness and finally end on a snappy, citric-like acidity, with soft hints of bubble gum and juicy fruits to add complexity.  Light alcohol warmth helps mitigate the effect of the sweet malts/esters and all the while, a distinctly Belgian yeast presence is fresh and endearing, adding depth to the flavor and authenticity to the style.  Really nice stuff, not aggressive with the alcohol or perfuminess, nor with the yeast character, but neither is it mellow in any category.  Well attenuated, preventing any syrupiness that some tripels succumb to.

-Multiple apples and pineapples lend their honeyed sweetness to the bready yeast and bulky cereal.
-An ample mouthfeel and rich texture benefit from the soft fluffy effervescence.

What if you dig deeper?
-I cannot recall the last time cereals came out so evidently when the body structure was so healthy.
-Alcohol is warming, but never aggressive.
-The yeast has worked overtime in this, loads of esters are developed, yet they dont feel strained.
-Decidedly, this apple crumbler of tripels is full of personality, and will please most Belgian lovers with a sweet tooth.
-A much younger tasting proved to be very hoppy and thus less fruity from the yeast. This batch appeared to have been drier as well, but that might have been an illusion from the increased hop presence throughout. I must say I preferred this freshness to the sweeter creature it usually is.
