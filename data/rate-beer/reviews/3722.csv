3722,"2010-09-03",2.8,"Bottle from Hophead22. Never been a fan of ""red beer"" or ""irish ales"" but hell... Ill give it a shot. Cask conditioned in a bottle?  Pours a red color, duh, no head to tell about it.. Aroma of some oak and vanilla. Taste is the same little oak and vanilla. Malty sweet... nothing bad or good. Texture is flat and oily... Overall just a below average beer, that i didnt finish. There is too many other good beers out there to drink this.","Newark, Delaware, USA","GMCC2181"
3722,"2010-07-08",3.2,"Crazy aroma: coconut bread, vanilla and dill.  Flavor has a hint of tartness up front then some creamy vanilla on the finish.  This beer is weird.  Im on the fence, but it seems like most people would love it or hate it.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","RCL"
3722,"2010-06-22",4.3,"Bottled 355ml. Courtesy of Saarlander. It pours a murky deep amber beer with a beautiful small light beige head which leaves an impecable lace. The nose is dominated by sublime american oak components which are flawlessly integrated with the malt profile- extremely inviting. Luscious milk chocolate, raisin, banana split and macadamia nuts apparent throughout. Malt accented. Sweet. Very low bitterness. The alcohol is remarkably well hidden. A little astringency adding to my apprecation of this beer. Medium bodied. Hardly any carbonation. More astringency on the swallow leading to a surprisingly dry (a lot less residual sugars than expected) finish which is reminiscent of oak, vanilla, raisin, licorice, macadamia nuts, clotted cream and banana split. Complex, mindblowingly delicious and definitely a beer possessing a huge amount of character. Big thanks to Aaron for bringing this beer from the city of gracious living!","SWITZERLAND","Embrouille"
3722,"2010-06-17",3.9,"Bottle from Total Wine. Pours a reddish amber color tiny lacey white head around the outside of the glass. Aroma is sugar cookies, faint bourbon and some defintie woody barrel. Taste is malty and tons of oakiness that is very nice in this beer with a very mild hint of maybe bourbon. Nice beer. This was way better than I though it would be.","Lake Arrowhead, California, USA","JoeTheYounger"
3722,"2010-04-21",4.0,"Slightly hazy red color, A nice Vanilla aroma. much tamer version of their red brew,  very crisp finish...theres bourbon here? I think so..or Im wrong? Slight wood, but mainly vanilla and  bourbon flavor...Going back tomorrow to buy all they have, so I can spread the wealth to Ratebeerians! Good job Curt!","Saarlouis, GERMANY","Saarlander"

3722,"2010-04-11",3.7,"12oz bottle from Total Wine. Rating #4. Slightly cloudy, darkish brown with a dirty white head. Slight woody aroma, I even pick up bit of bourbon maybe, I dont know what was in the barrel before they used it, but thats what I smell, very nice. Malty, a little more wood, very smooth and enjoyable. (1175)","Redlands, by way of Wisconsin,, California, USA","Hophead22"
3722,"2010-04-10",3.4,"Bottle; I think the first one of theirs I have seen in a 12 ounzer.  Poured a dark auburnish color with a khaki colored head.  Aroma of caramel, smoke/peat/roasted malt, bread, fruit, alcohol, cocoa and earth.  Flavor was pretty solid and tasty, but not mind blowing.  Caramel, earth, bread, roasted malt, with some fruit and yeast.  Impressive effort overall for the style.","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"
3722,"2010-03-25",3.6,"Caramel tasting, a very light hint of chocolate. Very lightly creamy. Hint of hoppiness to it.  A very good beer.","USA","Em"
