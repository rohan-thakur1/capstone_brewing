1653,"2016-06-28",3.9,"Cask at the lovely brewery, 6/11/16, listed at 3.7% abv.Dark mahogany-to-ebony body has light cola tints and shows a seemingly high clarity. Tan head is large and shows moderately strong retention.Big fruits in the nose mix with prune, dark chocolate, vanilla and a chalky-like minerality. Light treacle balances the creamy-honey base malts with more esters lingering on the end.Fruity again, in the mouth, with apple, strawberry, cherry-like esters as well as prunes and treacle to deepen things and add a bit of acidity. Roasted barley is not overdone, but adds a touch of char and lots of dark chocolate, as well. Soft, amply carbonated texture is slick at times and appropriately watery for quite a high drinkability. Love the abv, love the cleanliness and love the condition of the cask.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1653,"2016-06-01",3.8,"Pours jet black with a thick mocha head. Aroma of roast and chocolate. Taste follows, light yet flavorful.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","jcartamdg"
1653,"2016-05-01",3.6,"At the source: pours dark brown with a loose cask head. Aroma is roast, chocolate, and maybe a coffee. Taste is not very bitter or sweet. But it was a very nice dry stout. Mild and easy to drink. Good.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
1653,"2015-05-23",3.6,"On tap at the brewery. Pours a very dark brown with small beige head that diminishes to nothing. The aroma is roast, toffee, chocolate, wood. Thin mouthfeel, dark chocolate, roasted malt, lingering dryness, very good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
1653,"2015-05-03",3.6,"On tap at F and M. Pours black with medium mocha colored head. Very boring and chalky but a lot of English styles are like this. Wish it was hoppier but thats personal preference and didnt factor into the rate. Notes of peanut, coffee, dirty soil, cinnamon smooth malt. Its very clean and easy going but bland/light for todays hop crazed youth","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
1653,"2014-06-27",3.6,"Cask at the brewpub. Pours black with a medium sized brown head that dissipates slowly. The aroma has a smoky nose, a bit if dark chocolate. The taste has smoke, fire, really nice take on the style.","Spring City, Pennsylvania, USA","boxofrane"
1653,"2014-06-18",3.3,"On tap at the brewery on Fathers Day. Pours black in color with a small foamy tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, weak coffee, smoke, cinnamon, and booze. Taste of roasted malt, old coffee, cardboard, and hints of vanilla. On the flat side, like half the beers Ive tried here today!","Forked River, New Jersey, USA","Ed5388"
1653,"2014-05-06",2.9,"On tap at the brewpub, served in a tasting glass. Pours clear ruby-chestnut with a small tan head that fades to a thin remnant and leaves a moderate amount of fine lace. The nose has big coffee and roast malts with a touch of smoke. The flavour is dry with roasty notes, coffee and perhaps a touch of chocolate. The finish is short and soft with a nice roastiness. On the palate it is medium in body with a smooth, watery texture and soft carbonation. Overall this is a decent roasty ale with very smooth malts but a bit too light in body for the style. 2014-05-02","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"
