2999,"2016-03-11",1.7,"Funky lime green color with a diminished white head. Sells like a cheap margarita. Actually a bit more fruity than most. Sweet, sugary, cheap lime soda. Not catching the alcohol and Ill say Im not going to look for it either.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
2999,"2016-01-03",1.5,"24 ounce can from a 7-11 most likely. Weird pale lime color, hazy, thin fizzy white head, poor retention. Aroma of pale malt and lime. The taste is sweet lemon and lime, nothing else. Thin bodied, almost still.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
2999,"2015-09-19",1.6,"24oz can...neon green with a Bud Light margarita thing going on this is hardly a beer. If it was a beer it would be a crappy one. But as a cheap effervescent malt beverage it was not bad. I will even try the other flavors...this is our duty as beer raters even when the subjects arent beer.","Peoples Republic of Bloomington, Indiana, USA","paintedmaple"
2999,"2015-09-18",1.8,"24 oz can. Steel Reserve Alloy Series Margarita 211 is a lime green slightly hazy liquid with no real head. Nose is of wine cooler traditional lime margarita. Taste is about what youd expect, overly sweet fake lime. However, as Ive written around here before, Im a chump for fake chemical lime, so, in lieu of a real margarita, this is quite passable. Granted, Ive only ever seen them once at one store, real margaritas are infinitely more available.","Westerville, Ohio, USA","Panzuriel"
2999,"2015-09-08",2.8,"Looks like lemon aide with a green tint from a can, a 24 oz can. Taste is soda pop laced with some grain alky. What else can be said. On par with other SR fru fru fruity beers and better than straight up SR 211, fer sure. Hah, now I know what I was thinken; looks and smells like mountain dew.

2999,"2015-08-21",1.2,"24 ounce can. Salty lime and malt aroma. Hazy pale green with minimal head. Salty-sweet lime and light malt flavor.

2999,"2015-08-19",1.4,"Ummmm, does this really belong on RateBeer? And WTF is this, exactly? Margarita infused beer? I dont actually know I guess it tastes like a margarita, if youre already drunk it probably doesnt matter anyway. So who is this for? Women, teenagers and people who dont know better, and people like me who buy it out of curiosity. For what it is, it could be worse, I guess. Sickly pale green in color, very soda like in look, texture, and taste. No beer or alcohol taste, but instead sort of chemical taste. I cant say its my favorite","Oakland, California, USA","ffbot"
2999,"2015-08-14",2.1,"Tallboy. Aroma is margarita and beer, what else? Pours hazy pale green with a short lived white head. Taste is margarita-flavored malt liquor with no other flavors that I can detect. This isnt all that bad. Its not very good, either, but Its better than the putrid pineapple flavor.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"
2999,"2015-07-10",2.3,"Straight from a huge can. Aroma mostly of lime/citrus, grain, and metal. From the leftovers on top of the can, I can determine this beer is very light colored, bubbly, and has a light green tinge. Taste is of lime mostly and cardboard. Syrupy. Alcohol is undetected. Not bad, i guess.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","michcam8"

2999,"2015-05-06",4.0,"It looks like lime juice and smells like a margarita! The taste is not bad but more like one of those margaritas you get from the machine at the bar using a malt liquor instead of real tequila. On the plus side it is cheaper than getting one of those machine made margaritas. So overall... Its cheap, packs a punch, smells and looks like the real deal. Plan to get some more for when I am hanging out at the lake on a hot day.","Temple, Texas, USA","dlihcsnatas"
2999,"2015-04-29",2.3,"The money question on this one is if it is better than Bud Light Lime-A-Rita. The answer to that question is no, it is not. It tastes like a lime Popsicle, light a cheap margarita at some crap restaurant in Indiana only sweeter. It doesnt have any off flavors though so I guess if you are into sweet, sweet soda pop syrup that gets you drunk, this green machine might be your cup of tea.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

2999,"2015-04-15",2.6,"24 oz. can from anywhere. Pours a light, kind of cloudy lime green color with a fizzy mint green-tinted head that fades quickly into a ring. Its got a good margarita-like aroma but the flavor is weaker, relying on sugars and minerals. Light-medium bodied, with a sweet, mineralic mouthfeel and moderate to medium carbonation. Better than the Blk Berry and Spiked Punch, but not as good as Pineapple.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
2999,"2015-04-12",2.8,"Couldnt resist chasing all the steel reserve flavors. Doubt this one will be better than the pineapple. Pours Ecto Cooler lime green. Smells of sweet lime syrup and I may be imagining it but a hint of salt. Taste is actually pretty damn good and perhaps has the ablility to have the more than a can if in a certain pool-type situation. I think I like better than the pineapple. Lime, bit of boozy, huh.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"
2999,"2015-04-10",2.5,"24 oz. can pours a sickly light green with tiny fizzy white head and no lacing. Smells just like a lime margarita. Aroma has lime, Mountain Dew, and just a hint of corn to remind you that this is supposed to be a malt liquor. Taste is sweet all the way through with artificial lime sourness. Alcohol is well hidden. Medium body with a slightly sticky mouthfeel and lively carbonation. I have a perverse affinity for Steel Reserves Alloy alcopops, available at the finest gas stations near you, but this one was more disappointing than the other flavors Ive tried.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ccex"

Mouthfeel is artificially sticky.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"

2999,"2015-03-07",3.0,"Can, no thanks to HeyKevin... boosted in my dining room... just now.
Pours a very pale green color with a quick rise and fall head. 

The aroma really strikes that Margarita/Malt Liquor balance. Sure its got limes & salt, but its got graininess, grape, alcohol, and raw dough!

The flavor tips the scales towards margarita flavor... WHY NOT!?!?! Its salty and tart like a gose, sweet like a pre-packaged cocktail, and boozy, lightly corny, and brashly malty like a great Steel Reserve Malt Liquor.

2999,"2015-02-10",2.3,"First to rate! 2/10/15. I guess I should have waited one day to try this! 24oz can from the Kwik-E-Mart nearest my house, which tends to be my gold mine for this type of stuff. Anyway, this pours a hilarious pale neon green with a very short lived white-green had that sizzles to nothing, no lacing of course. After this teku I will just finish out of the can, most likely. Sweet margarita aroma, like a bottle of margarita syrup youd buy at a liquor store to mix with tequila and ice. A little tart, fake lime candy, a hint at orange juice - not as beery as the others, as I vaguely recall. The flavor is about the same, quite sweet, delivers on the margarita aspect again - lime, sweet, a hint at OJ. Really not too offensive aside from the sweetness. The flavor again lacks a sort of ""beer"" aspect. This is very similar to the Bud Lime-A-Rita except a bit less harsh, in my opinion. If marketed differently, this could give those A-Ritas a run for their money. I cant imagine myself pounding these all day like hoppy cask gold ales or anything, but all in all, Im not hating it. I might try the rest of my can on ice. It sure beats some of the local ""craft beer"" Ive had as of late.","Georgia, USA","drowland"
