795,"2012-03-14",3.2,"Dark black body with no head. Smells of wheat and a little lager? Tastes like a great mix of the two and it is a beautiful balance","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","brew3crew"
795,"2011-01-09",3.7,"Dark brown with a modest white head. Lots of yummy nectar fruits, a killer yeast character, and a slight hint of roasty malts make for a delectable quaff.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"
795,"2011-01-07",3.0,"Pours deep mahogany into a Sam glass. Mocha conglomerate head with good retention recedes leaving sheet lacing. Dark caramel aromas. Slightly thin with sweet bubblegum upfront turning to roasted caramel and sweet cloves before a lasting slightly sour smoke finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
795,"2010-09-03",5.0,"Got two 22oz bottles from the gift shop next to the brewpub. Came out of the bottle with a wonderful frothy head, almost like a nitro brew. Wonderful banana aromas. The flavor is well of banana and malts, with a little spice on the back side. This is a perfectly balanced, delicious and refreshing dunkelweizen. My idea of a ""perfect"" beer! (I also had it ontap at the brewpub, and it was equally great).","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","MaBeer1972"
795,"2010-08-21",3.3,"had a pint on Tap with liveFREEorRYE. Head was nearly gone by the time it got to the table. Deep dark amber color.  Aroma very nice malt. Lingers slightly on the finish.  One  of the better brews this place has to offer. A+","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
795,"2010-08-20",4.1,"Really excellent.  Aromas of clove, banana and milk chocolate - classic.  The flavor is lightly chocolaty, with notes of plantain and just enough spices to make it delicious and interesting with a full, rich mouth-feel.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","RCL"
795,"2010-07-21",4.0,"A darned fine example of the style.  Pour was chestnut brown, no head or lacing.  A nice rich dlavor of banana, roast and clove.  A typical description, but rich and a nice balance of all the classic flavors.  Well done.","Middletown, Delaware, USA","Goodgrief"
795,"2009-09-17",2.9,"Cloudy brown pour with a slight off-white head.. Aroma was sweet caramel malt with some sweet banana and clove up front.  Flavor was a little harsh, banana and clove spice that really was too phenolic at points. Some definite peatiness, as identified by FlacoAlto, but really a bit muddled.  An ultimately unsuccessful interpretation in my mind.","Chester, Vermont, USA","Jblauvs"
795,"2009-02-03",2.9,"Extremely aggressively carbonated as a very soft pour nets me seven fingers of foamy, lightly browned head (including one above the rim of my glass) and some foam overflow on my desk.  The beer is a dark plum color that shows a hazy, red amber color when held up to the light.  The aroma has lots of clove, a touch of up front banana, a toasty malt character and a definite smokiness in the finish.  The smokiness has overtones of burning plastic to it, though it never gets really out of hand and really reminds me of Peat smoked malt.  Definitely interesting, certainly not bad, but I was not expecting the smoke.

The taste has a sweetness to it up front with some light clove notes, the smokiness then kicks in adding smoky flavors as well as phenolic notes that seem to be a little harsh at times.  This has a rich maltiness to it up front that is quite nice (unfortunately this is quickly drowned out by the salty peat smoke).  The peat smoke really lingers on in the palate too and interferes with subsequent sips; it is really hard to pull out any other flavors because of this.  

A very interesting interpretation of a Dunkel Weizen.  I think that beech-wood smoked malt would have been a better choice here as it would have melded better with the traditional Weizen flavors (indeed I have had good smoked Weizens in Bamberg before).  Ultimately the Peat-smoked malt clashes with the rest of the beer, such that this really just doesnÂ’t work for me.  I do like the attempt though as it is an interesting try.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
795,"2009-01-03",3.9,"On tap at the brewpub. Murky, dirty brown with a small tan head. Wheat, caramel, bubblegum and light banana make for an interesting nose. Complex flavor too, all of the above plus an underlying spiciness and a whiff of smoke. Good stuff!","Virginia Beach, USA","Immy"
795,"2008-09-15",4.0,"draft @ brewery - ordered up a pint of this right after i finished the sampler; hazy brown with foamy tan head; sweet aromas of candy malts, caramel, cloves; lovely soft texture and full body; a little smoke and bananas show up in the flavors; very nice; my fav of the portsmouth stop","Seattle, Washington, USA","SuzyGreenberg"
795,"2008-08-28",3.4,"On tap at Portsmouth Brewey served in a pint glass clear brown on color with nan off-white head. Aroma was a light banana and caramel malt. Flavor was caramel malt with a touch of yeast/bread and some cloves.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","OldRaspy"
795,"2008-08-20",3.6,"[bottle and draft] Cloudy amber color, very nice white foam. Very hazy. Strong banana aroma, with some mild clove. Flavors are tart and spicy, with some slight caramel malt sweetness. Full of great weizen yeast character in the finish. Spot-on for the style.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","BitchesBrew"
795,"2008-08-20",1.9,"Way too many flavors for my liking.  It seemed like too many flavors can be a bad thing or atleast to my liking.","New York City, New York, USA","urnamesucks"
795,"2006-11-20",3.7,"Light amber in color with traditional wheat beer haze and a small white head. Aroma of banana,bubble gum, clove, mellow bready yeast, and wheat malt tang. Flavor is slightly sweet,wheat malt,banana,clove and spicy. Medium-full body for a wheat beer, feels great on the palate.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","dirtymike"
795,"2005-11-03",3.9,"Smoked version.  On draught at the brewery, 10/28/2005. Pours a very nicely unfiltered, nearly muddy beige-tan-amber with tons of well-retained caramel colored head, foamy and creating much lacing as it recedes. The aroma shows restrained smoked notes of light charred wood, bits of burnt bacon and a thick saltiness. On top of the smoke, which is more in the background, is a very vibrant weizen yeast with light cloves, bubble gum, white pepper and then a nice dose of caramel to finish. The flavor begins with a tremendous balance of bananas, cloves, and salty wood smoke. Smoked bananas?? Yum. Add to it a healthy dose of earthy malt flavors, a sweet buttercream note and then a dry, woody finish, with raisins, more smoke and light chocolate. Very complex as it warms up more, with more smoke apparency, though never over-the-top. Body is medium to medium full for the style with a slippery and at times creamy texture. Perhaps a little bit watery as it finishes, but that much more drinkable because of it. No alcohol apparency, moderate carbonation. As I drank it, I dubbed the mini-Schlenkerla Weizen.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
