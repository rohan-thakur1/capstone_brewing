3860,"2016-05-27",4.3,"500 ml bottle, born on date of 050316.

Aroma is really nice, the brew smells mostly like pine and citrusy (tropical fruit, grapefruit, peaches) hops, along with some bready malt. As soon as I poured this into the glass, the aroma was noticeable right away. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, its mainly pine and citrusy (tropical fruit, citrus peel, grapefruit) hops with a bit of bready maltiness. With the aroma I thought the tropical fruit/citrusy hops stood out more, but it seemed to me that there was more balance between the pine and tropical fruit/citrusy flavors.

There is such a lovely hoppiness. Such a good tropical fruit, hoppy juiciness, and a little bit of a malt sweetness on the back end. There is a subtle dankness on the back that I also love. The flavor is really piney and resin based up front. The bouquet of hops falls off drastically. The tropical fruits that existed become an afterthought. For a beer that started out with so much potential, it's disappointing. The mouth feel is slick and light with a decent carbonation, but then it just falls right off the tongue. The aftertaste has a lingering bite to it, but I can't tell if it's malt or hop. So disappointing.

That I was visiting from Idaho and just happened in that very day makes me think I should also have purchased Lotto.
I find a bright grapefruit; fresh, ripe apricots; a brilliant spruce accent as soon as the cap is lifted and the sweetness of the fruits are lifted up over the neck like a soft cloud of smells. I immediately want a fresh strawberry to add into the glass, but know that I would only cut my experience in half if I did it.
The liquid is cool on my tongue, the carbonation at perfect levels to deliver this brew. The head is soft and eggshell in color, dense and lacing the glass heavily, never actually disappearing, but diminishing slowly as I drink. The bitterness of this IPA is evenly distributed throughout my mouth, the carbonation helping it to find its way over and underneath my tongue, biting it steadily with its beautiful hops edge and then disappearing down my throat with a whisper of caramel and pine left behind. Its finish is gentle for an IPA, but Im sure that anything I drink immediately afterward will surely be twisted by the strength of this combination of taste and flavor.

Glass: Weyerbacher tulip.

3860,"2014-07-02",4.1,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a dark brown, nearly black color with a one finger head of a thick creamy head of an off white color. The head fades rather quickly leaving a little bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 
 Smell  The aroma of the beer is big of tropical fruit smell of tangerine, pineapple, and papaya mixed with a nice aroma of a ruby red grapefruit. Along with the grapefruit are aromas of a pine and slightly grassy smell.

 Taste  The taste begins a much drier than anticipated flavor with some slightly bready and crackery flavors mixed with a moderately strong grapefruit hop. As the taste advances, the grapefruit remains at a relatively constant level with the light level of sweetness that was present upfront (lighter tangerine and tropical fruit flavor) fading and being replaced by more hop flavors. The hop flavors that replace the sweet are a mix of a grassy and pine flavor, with the combination of flavors leaving a nice crisp somewhat drier blend of hop flavors to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is lighter side for a beer of 7 % abv with a carbonation level that was rather average. For the crisp feel of the brew, in conjunction with the drier flavors the slightly thinner body and moderate carbonation were quite nice as they made it quite refreshing and crisp all while not compromising the nice fruit and hop flavors of the brew.

 Overall  A nice and tasty IPA that is a bit on the drier side but has a great flavor and drinkability. Quite nice.","","Darkmagus82"

Ok, so Im highly suggestible, but what else was I supposed to do with a beer called ""Lunch"", other than have it with lunch? And it worked - it was a very pleasant IPA with lunch. This is a particularly good IPA: the hop profile is quite enthusiastic, to the point that its almost on par with a DIPA. Not a hop bomb or a palate wrecker by any means, but definitely hoppy and interesting, with just enough malt to balance the hop bitterness.

Pours golden and a bit hazy with medium white head and left plenty of lacing. Aroma of mango, some mild grapefruit and orange, maybe a hint of pine. Taste followed the smell and was amazing and very well-balanced. Hint of sweetness in there, but mainly a good amount of bitter and dry paired together.

The taste is more balanced than many west coast styled IPAs but it is not sweet either. The dankness luckily is more an accent than a ""maine"" character. Slight herbal and peppery finish.

Actually quite a nice juicy fruit aroma full of mangoes, pineapples, ruby red grapefruit and lychee. Very nice hop profile and with a good strength. Pine is light on the end and the honey and light sweet bread-like maltiness do a good job of balancing. As it warms, there is quite a bit more citrus, actually a lovely, light tangerine aroma.Zesty hoppiness in the mouth is not quite acidic, thankfully, but still very bitter and showing more citrus dryness on the finish than the nose lets on. Malts are dry, a touch bready and provide good body. Fruitiness and light pine linger very nicely.Despite their zealousness for hopping the hell out of their beers, its hard not to fall in love with the mouthfeel and near-perfect maltiness of MBCs beers.

3860,"2014-01-17",3.8,"Reviewed from notes. Bottled on 6/25/12. Consumed 6/26/12.
Into a pint glass.
The appearance is a hazy brown colored body giving a half finger white head that lasted for at least a minute. Some slight bubbles were seen speckling the sides of my pint glass. There was barely any lacing.
The smell was based around the pine and citrus with the hops pushing forward for a great combination. I smelled the alcohol once the beer warmed.
The taste had a piney with a bitter hoppy edge and some citrus coming out in second place.
On the palate it held about a sort of medium-ness balanced body somewhat between a wet and dry, somewhat sessionable - I could see this going with its respected food.
Overall, this was a mostly impressive beer that I would definitely have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Appearance: Burnt umber/rusty orange hue. So hazy that its opaque. Forms a large, white, frothy head which laces and retains wonderfully.

Smell: Stone fruit with significant vegetable component of garlic and other seasonings.

Taste: 2013 has been the year of the New England IPA for me. Ive had quite a few beers of the style from breweries Ive never been able to try before, and I notice theres an eerie similarity to their taste. However, what they also have in common is my enjoyment of them. And while Maine Beer Company Lunch is another great example of the regional style, I think Ive reached a point where it doesnt impress me as much as it once did.

Like the other New England IPAs, ""Lunch,"" is a palette of two distinctive movements. Up front its sweet and juicy with a tropical fruit flavor of passion fruit, guava and red grapefruit. Then it transforms on a dime to garlic and green onion with a residual flavor of spice rack seasonings (which become stronger as the beer warms). The bitterness is noticeable throughout, but restrained, and complements the palette nicely. Theres an arid dryness as it finishes, though it fades away quickly. The body is well-balanced with plenty of amber and pale maltiness, but I wouldnt consider it a sweet or malty beer per se. Overall, its a very good IPA, and Id probably rate it higher if I hadnt already had so many comparable beers prior. 

Drinkability: Though plenty robust and full-bodied, ""Lunch"" is a remarkably easy drinker. The mouthfeel is calm and soft, with an almost creamy texture and smooth finish. There is a slight aftertaste of spicy hops and general dryness, but its mild and tolerable. Each swig is refreshing for a short moment as it crosses the tongue. At 7% ABV its a strong beer, but not an obtuse one. Its also versatile as it can be enjoyed on its own or with a meal.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
3860,"2013-08-25",4.4,"Oh my is this ever good! Nose is a tropic fruit explosion with just a sweet malty touch in there.

3860,"2013-07-27",4.4,"I was at a Maine Beer night at the Blind Tiger Ale House about a month ago. I knew I would love this beer from the description so I left it for last. Big mistake...just when I got thru all the other Maine beers and asked for Lunch...the keg had kicked! I begged the bartender to splash some foam into a tasting glass and fortunately he did. From that I was able to tell a lot...especially the aroma (nice hoppy and citrusy smell) and a good sense of the palate & mouthfeel. Obviously I couldnt judge the appreance (other than ""empty""...LOL!). Low & behold a day later I wandered into Murrays Cheese Bar (the new bar/restaurant...not the store) and with only 6 taps there was Lunch just sitting there waiting to be pulled. Needless to say I availed myself of a couple. I then came back twice over the next 3 days until I pretty much killed it. Apparently no other beer geeks had discoved this place or its hidden jewel in the interim...LOL! Lucky me. So I can report that the appreance was very nice...a somewhat pale golden amber. I can also say that having drank as much of it as I did I became a big fan. I also had a chance to notice more of the flavors and character of this complex and very pleasing beer...to enjoy the hop smell and flavor. The beer is piney...but not as much as say a Heady Topper. Also flavors of fruits...something between an apricot and peach. My hat is off the Maine Beer company for this stellar effort.

3860,"2013-06-30",4.4,"500ml bottle into a New Belgium goblet.

A: Pours a hazy orange-copper color. Very hazy, actually. About two fingers of fluffy, off-white head is formed, and the retention is fabulous. The lacing left on the glass is both sudsy and plentiful.

S: Unsurprisingly, its loaded with citrusy hops. I notice grapefruit, mango, apricot, and melon alongside some more typical pine notes. Slight biscuity maltiness is evident, too. While it didnt quite blow me away like I expected it to, its still a great aroma, head-and-shoulders above many IPAs.

T: The citrus notes are even more evident on the flavor profile. A huge opening of fresh grapefruit, apricot, melon, and mango provides an evocative juiciness that I love. Mild pine bitterness and slight biscuity tones appear on an otherwise clean finish. This really does a fantastic job of showcasing fruity hops in a balanced manner.

M: Pretty much ideal here: clean, crisp, bone-dry, low bitterness, and light. Id call it easy to drink, but this is one of those beers I dont want to end. Soft carbonation adds to the wonderful mouthfeel.

O: Its easy to see why this is hyped. As far as east-coast IPAs go, I cant think of one thats on this level - maybe super-fresh Troegs Perpetual IPA or Flower Power? Obviously I havent sampled any of the (supposed) Vermont masterpieces, but Id still imagine this one is really high up the totem pole regardless. And to think I was ready to complain about MBC pricing before sampling this - Id gladly pay $8/500ml for this one again.

3860,"2013-06-16",4.2,"Pours bright like orange sunshine. Cloudy with an ample head that fell off amiably and slow. Good thick cap that never left, cascades of lace and great legs too. Nose is captivating and crisp with ripe fruits. Orange citrus, tangerine, tropical pineapple and a little lemon. With some light pine it smells juicy and dry at the same time. Floral. Malt is grainy and deeply sweet underneath and brings an icy quality that delights with a touch of sugar. Taste is positively vivid. Tropical fruits are ripe and juicy, a little tangy. The malt comes over the mid palate to delight with more bread than you were expecting. Hops are earthy and smooth. They announce themselves with a plucky bitter that takes you to a clean, dry finish. The aftertaste glows as much as the presentation. Theres some alcohol warmth for comfort after all that excitement. 

The body is creamy and has a texture unlike any other IPA. Its complex and full without heaviness. Not complex because it has too many things going on, but because each quality is deeply met and it has perfect balance. The fruits are succulent, the malt resounds. The hop perfume lasts and translates into the drink. The resin is light and the bitter is essential. Intense but not overdone. This IPA soars.","New York, USA","pinkie"

Aroma: The nose has lots of pine/resin, with some grapefruit/tropical fruit, and caramel notes

Appearance: This beer pours a hazed copper-orange color with a sticky, off-white head/lace

Flavor: The flavor is quite fresh and hoppy, it is light-medium sweet, and a medium-plus bitter

Palate: This one has a great, clean drinkability, a medium body, a soft carbonation, and a dry finish

Overall Impression: 
Obviously, I like the name, since lunch is when I do some of my best drinking!  Anyway, as for the beer, this one has a great IPA nose.  The pine/resin, grapefruit/tropical fruit, and caramel all work really well together.  The pour is quite nice as well.  The flavor is excellent, and unsurprisingly, the feel is quite good too.

S: Im getting great citrus and pear notes. Reminds me of a flowery fruit basket. Im getting the ever so slightest of the cracker malts as well. Again Im impressed so far.

T: A perfectly blended sweetness of fruits, apples and pears, and light flowers. The cracker malts lead in to the mild bitter hops on the finish and you have a simple yet elegant beer. Great.

M: Perfectly carbonated. Medium to light bodied with a great pear like fruitiness left on the palate.

Murky, light brown, with a small white head.  Seriously, thats the type of shits I took after eating those lunches.  Lightly fruity aroma with peach and nectarine.  Taste is malty with some orange and grapefruit coming through.  Mainly its just caramel and cardboard with a pine and lemon solvent-like finish.  Slightly astringent.

3860,"2012-07-07",4.5,"500mL Bottle, purchased at The Good Beer Store - Fryeburg, ME. Juicy strong papaya, pineapple, and passionfruit aroma. As good as youd want the tropical hop flavors to be in any wildly American IPA. Flavors turn towards pine, fir sap, fresh orange zest and herbs. Interesting to have such a difference between the aroma and flavor hops, usually brewers really blur those line.s Overall, the hop work is as good or better than most west coast hop bombs. Clean and balanced in malt sweetness. Another impeccable work from Maine Beer, my favorite New England brewery.

I lucked into this bottle because a good friend had my back, thanks Bert. Pours a slightly hazy deep golden amber color with a huge meringue like head that leaves lots of stickies on the way down. This smells incredible! Grapefruit, pine, resin, a bit of tangerine or orange, and hardly any barley to be found. The flavor follows the aroma obviously. Theres a splash of bready malt somewhere in the beginning before the resinous pine and citrus onslaught. Nice tropical fruit flavors coming through along side the dank sticky pine and resin. Finish is fairly dry with a pleasant lingering hoppy bite. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. If this beer wasnt so damn hard to get and so highly priced I would drink these all the time, its a beautiful beer.

3860,"2012-04-11",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 24, 2013 My Bottom Line:
Pine-y, floral and citrus-y hops are grounded in a cushion of a mouthfeel for a highly engaging, earthy IPA.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the misty pale amber.
-Resinous bitterness is leveled with the rest of the friendly flavor profile.
-The mouthfeel is quite dry, which increases drinkability.
-My first bottle (Spring 2012) had lots of sediment in it, and it was hard to pour a glass without getting too much of it. Subsequent bottles though have been impeccable on that front.
-Oranges peek through here and there.
-Dont look for complexity in this one. Its just a beautiful hop vehicle.

That of mango, pineapple, and oranges.  Some sticky pine notes mix in.  This has a solid caramel malt backbone without being too thick which allows the hops to be showcased.

3860,"2012-03-07",3.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 8/22/2011.  Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a tulip.

Lunch pours a murky brown color with bright golden edges. Kind of a different, darker look than I am used to seeing for an IPA. A nice rocky, foamy off-white head forms on top and leaves some nice lace on the glass.

The aroma is very hoppy and floral with some grapefruit and pineapple as well. 

Light biscuity malt starts off the flavor with a touch of sweetness, then a fairly flat grapefruit and pineapple hoppiness through the end. The finish has a light, lingering bitterness.

This has a light to medium body, with carbonation tilted toward the creamy side while retaining its bubbly nature. A resiny finish.

Throw a couple of hop pellets into any beer and I will most likely enjoy it at least a little bit. That said, this really did not blow me away as anything spectacular. Kind of an IPA with an even keel attitude.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Upon first sip of this beer I was highly disappointed.  But I let it sit for a while and as it warmed up, more and more taste came out.  In the end I enjoyed it.  Lemon once again rules the taste.

Pours a very hazy golden orange color with some darker tones. A thick, frothy head rests on top of the brew, retaining very well with nice legs. Spotty webs of lacing coat the glass while drinking.

Pretty inviting aroma with an enormous amount of citrus character. Grapefruit is right up front with some orange and pineapple notes. Hints of bread and caramel with very little warmth.

Bold and bitter up front with powerful juicy hop flavor. Grapefruit really sings on this one with juice and peel tones - pithy and pulpy accompanied by some orange tones. Touches of pineapple and more tropical tones add in some sweetness. Milder malt backbone adds in some biscuit and caramel touches. Not overly sweet at all, but the beer still manages to temper the hoppy citrus. Finishes bitter and very juicy.

Medium body, decent carbonation, explosive juiciness and sticky feel. In an avalanche of IPAs, this is one to remember - Id definitely like more of this. Im also a fan of the packaging, even though the pricing isnt the best.","Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","xnicknj"

T - Grapefruit and some resinous pine followed by a light caramel bready malt and some floral/earthiness. Extremely balanced and refreshing. The finish is lightly bitter. Mouth feel is medium and carbonation is moderate.

O - This was a very good IPA. Not worth the high price and its a bit of a pain tracking it down, but I am impressed by this beer.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

3860,"2011-10-14",4.0,"In short: An excellent citrusy/grapefruity IPA
How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed fresh a few weeks after purchase
The look: Cloudy dark amber body topped by a large off-white head with good retention
In long: Nose is high-alpha acids hops with plenty of grapefruity hops.  Taste is all mostly about the hops.  Maine Beer so-called amber ale (Zoe) had a sweet heavier malt bill but this Lunch IPA surprisingly has a low-profile malt bill.  Basic sweet pale malts with a neutral sugary white-bread flavor.  There was also quite a bit of yeast in the second half of the bottle which added to the bready sensation.  Hopping is very citrusy (mostly grapefruity) and also some notes of pineapples and watermelons.  Bitterness is sharp and short-lived, nothing resinous and sticky here.  I was hoping for something great, its not quite great, but I really loved that beer nonetheless.  I like this brewery and also respect what they stand for.  Maine Beer Brewing is an environment conscious brewery, member of the 1% For The Planet organization.  I approve.  People, please be respectful to our planet, re-use before recycling.

3860,"2011-10-11",3.8,"500ml bottle courtesy of Zane on the other site.  Pours a deep orange/amber with a white head that retains fairly well throughout the glass.  Aroma is hops with a fair amount of orange and some citrus zest.  Taste is not nearly as hop forward as the aroma leads one to believe.  Some hop bitterness but citrus with a tiny amount of pine. Some lemon and slight sweetness.  Mouth feel is thicker than a lot of IPAs which I dig.  Overall, this was a nice IPA that gets better and better as it warms up.  Still missing a little something to make it outstanding.","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"

Overall lovely and way better than my original rating.  


2012-----My 2nd stand out beer from Main Beer... brewing and branding...this company really seem to get it.   While not as complex or compelling as the Spring Peeper Ale this is as good of an IPA I can think of from New England.  Resin, pine, tangerine, floral hops are well balanced and nicely balanced and forward but not indulgent.  A dark orange clear orange with incredible lacing.  The lightly sweet biscuit malts are there in the aroma and taste.  It starts very bitter, becomes lightly sweet, and ends with warmth and spicey.  The mouth-feel is quite nice, something that I?m imagining will be their hallmark.  But in this beer all the elements, while each very nice, seem a bit disconnected.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","bmerz"

Freshly bottled on 7/1 and consumed on 7/11. Nice.  Way better than originally rated.  Nice catty citrus aspects throughout with some bready malt accents to go with the aforementioned.

3860,"2011-08-29",3.9,"500mL thanks to Travlr. Pours a clear orange amber with a massive, off-white head. Massive retention and giant lacing. Nose is fruity hops with squashy melons. Softer aroma than The Kernel ACC Pale Ale I just had, less aggressive in the nose. But this one has some subtle complexity like vanilla ice cream, peaches. Yum. Taste is a little sugary and sticky with vanilla, nutty bitterness, sugary strawberry. Gets a little cheesy. Probably not the freshest bottle, but very well made. One of those breweries that is under the radar but making top notch stuff.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

3860,"2011-08-25",3.5,"500ml bottle, LOT 072111, consumed about 1 month out from bottling.  I should preface this rating by saying that this brew was consumed in immediate succession to Maine Beer Cos stellar Peeper Ale.  Though it falls well short of that masterpiece, this is still a damn good IPA in its own right.The pour yields a cloudy, ruddy, brownish-orange amber body.  A billowing, thick head of eggshell colored froth settles slowly to a lilypad-esque clump.  Dense suds climb the walls of the glass, drying as hard, thick-banded swaths of lace.  The nose is peppery, touching on white grapefruit flesh and pith most prominently in the hop profile.  Malts are on the dry side, showing good attenuation, but the caramel sweetness of the crystal malt is still a bit too prominent for me.  Crusty bread and crackers also come to mind.  Flavors follow suit, drinking quite spicy, almost like a borderline Belgian IPA at points.  Subdued grapefruit meets drying, bready, grainy malt from start to finish.  The palate is substantive and moderately carbonated, with a long, bitter, drying finish.  Good, unique brew overall, but its little brother, The Peeper, destroys it.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
3860,"2011-08-25",4.0,"nice new ipa, this stuff is good and different. first off, the head is immense and very creamy and long lasting with tons of lacing. although the head is so large and lasts so long it gets in the way a bit maybe. Very floral, lots of fruits showing up, including berries faintly, lots of bittersweet citrus, just a huge and pure amount of hop presence here. its a lot, but its not overwhelmingly bitter or lingering. the body is creamy with carb, but thinner in the back which adds to its drinkability. the malt profile is very light, biscuits and crackers, and it really lets the hops shine.","Notown, California, USA","wavers1"
3860,"2011-08-20",3.6,"A decent offering from Maine Beer Co.  Pretty fresh, too, as the girl at the Market in downtown Portland said they had just got that in.  Pours an amber-orange, smells of tropical fruits, goes down with a nice bite.  Head retention is spot on.  Sure, Ive had better IPAs, but for this region, this is probably hands down the best IPA, other than Sebagos IPA, I had while in Maine.","Chesterton, Indiana, USA","jezmez68"
3860,"2011-08-18",3.7,"Beautiful cloudy deep amber liquid. The off-white head stis above it as if it were inseperable, dense and perfectly clinging. Rare are the unfiltered IPA that are such lookers. The first sniff unveils confident citrus, bright pink grapefruit and tangerine. It must be noted that those aromas, while forward, are not feeling agressive despite the soft toasted malts merely serving a support role. In mouth, its engaging carbonation lightens up the sweet crystal malts that would otherwise feel a little sugary and strong on the honeyed side. At the same time, the citrusy hops keep popping up, feeling perhaps a bit simple for such a broad array of hops used. The finishing bitterness plays in the bitter/acid department, but never agressively so, supported by a biscuity roundness. Filling mouthfeel, as seems to be the norm for Maine Brewing. Cool beer, in a very natural mold, but not quite enough hop complexity, nor dryness when paired with the high level of carbonation makes this less fun to drink than, for instance, their peeper. Still, very good stuff and far beyond average.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
3860,"2011-08-15",3.9,"[bottle]
Awesome aroma of pink grapefruit and faint pine and strawberry. Hops dominate the flavour with grapefruit and its peel followed by base malt and then strawberry accents.

3860,"2011-08-14",3.5,"Bottled sample shared with oakbluff. Medium orange in colour with fairly strong carboation and a bit of haze. Aromas are of pine sap, bready malts, navel orange, pink grapefruit, and light caramel. More pine sap and caramel in the mouth, along with a more vague citrus quality and black pepper. Medium bodied and fairly bitter. A well executed straight up IPA.

3860,"2011-08-09",3.8,"Hazy bronze pour gives a creamy, resinous aroma; highly normal and highly satisfying; low on details, some pears, some flowers.  Whiffs of perfume linger long, and good ripe pears eventually become pleasantly predominant.  Clean, citrusy flavor of fresh hops and the lightest pale malts showing in a simple honey flavor; its forward and full, and somewhat sweet.

Brisk, medium palate makes it easy to drink while its full flavor keeps the attention.  Finishes with a stickiness that I could do without, though the flavor remains rooted in those oily hops.  This is a high-level, well executed example that just doesnt quite suit my particular taste, but its very much worth seeking out.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Pours a somewhat-hazed copper color. Pretty bright, actually. The head sits at two-to-three fingers for awhile before falling down and leaving a cascade of thick lacing on the sides of the glass. Thin cap and collar throughout. Good looking beer. The nose brings a bit of citrus and a fair amount of tropical hops. Everything blends together quite well. Just a light bit of bread in the background.

The flavor starts off tropical with some mango, slight pineapple, and actually a bit of cantaloupe. Light orange there as well. Really smooth bitterness hits throughout. Medium body and only a slight hint of alcohol, which actually works its way in nicely with the bitterness. Average carbonation. Smooth going down again and again. Really nice beer. Cheers to the whale who inspired this brew.
