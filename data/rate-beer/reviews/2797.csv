2797,"2014-09-12",3.2,"Never thought I actually had the style defined as polotmavy on this site, till I stumbled upon an old rating of this one. Moussy, sticky head, brownish copper colour; caramelly aroma with spicy hops and some nuttiness. Malty taste, smooth, caramelly, hint of toasted bitterishness in the finish along with Bohemian, aromatic hops. Quite enjoyable and thirst-quenching.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
2797,"2014-06-21",3.5,"0.5 l botttle. Pours a clear red with a frothy tan head. Fairly mild aroma with some mild cereal grain and fig. Initial flavor is pretty mellow, with some light malt and raisin. Middle flavor is a lightly sweet, bready malt that slowly transforms into a mellow, herby hop bitterness. 
Light carbonation with a medium body and slick mouthfeel. Overall, nothing really outstanding in this beer, but very quafable. If given the option, I could see myself drinking this throughout the night and being perfectly happy.","NETHERLANDS","Mainuh_man"
