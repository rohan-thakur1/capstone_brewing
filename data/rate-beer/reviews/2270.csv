2270,"2016-01-17",4.3,"Az egyik legizgalmasabb típus a sörök világában véleményem szerint a belga stílusú darabok között keresendő, nevezetesen a quadrupel az, amely szédületes mélységek és szemkápráztató sokszínűség hordozója, ha pedig az egyébként is nehézsúlyú főzet érlelés alá kerül, onnantól nincs megállás a végtelenül sokrétű ízvilág létrejötte felé. Ez esetben vörösboros hordó szolgált otthonául nem kevés ideig a masszív italnak, ennek eredményeképpen pedig egy olyan szerkezet elevenedett meg, amely utánozhatatlan módon jeleníti meg mindazt, ami minden quadrupel sajátja kell, hogy legyen, annál azonban még jóval többet is, amely tulajdonságok azonban csak a legkivételesebb darabok sajátjai. A sötétségbe burkolózó ital krémes, bézs színű habbal a tetején festői képet ad, illatmolekulái pedig szinte mérhető súllyal rendelkeznek. A karaktere mázsás komponensek jelenlététől hangos, a desszertszerű ízvilág, melyre a címke is felhívja a figyelmünket, roskadozik az ízjegyek tömegétől. Zseniális, ahogyan a félédes vörösborok zamata adja meg az elegáns keretét a sörnek, amely bár szőlőt vélhetően igen keveset látott, e tulajdonsága mégsem gátolja meg abban, hogy a bor az első dolog legyen, amire asszociálhatunk ízét illetően. Az érlelés ez esetben valóban nemesítő jelleggel hatott a főzetre. A diós, zserbós és mazsolás hangulatok átjárnak minden kortyot, melyek teltebbek már nem is lehetnének, ezekre aztán egy likőrös, fekete cseresznyés, befőttes lepel kerül, hogy zárásként enyhe füstös, hamus és sültes képek tegyék még gazdagabbá a benyomások tárházát.

Nøgnes previous attempt at a red wine barrel aged quad, the over-carbonated Aurora Australis, wasnt that successful in my opinion. In that one the sour red wine notes were too intrusive and not well integrated with the quad notes. The one in my glass this evening however... It pours a very deep amber to brown body, with a small but fully lasting beige head that leaves some lacing on my glass. The aroma is complex and very strong, I get delicious notes of sweet fruits, raisins, cask wood, vanilla, leather and roasted malt. In the back I get some red wine, but also some bourbon-like notes (which I guess is due to the oak) and chocolate. Complex, stunning and strong flavour of dark dried fruits (now more prune-like instead of the raisins in the aroma), sweet generic fruits, roasted malt, caramel, wood and vanilla. Less obvious notes include port wine, red wine, white mould cheese and warming and pleasant alcohol. Its a very sweet brew indeed, and there is not much bitterness in the long-lasting finish, so youll have to have a sweet tooth to really enjoy this one. Amazing mouthfeel, its of course full-bodied, has a syrupy and smooth texture and is softly carbonated. By far the best red wine barrel aged beer Ive ever had! Instead of giving overwhelming notes of sour and cheap red wine, the barrels first of all give rise to a woody vanilla heaven that blends perfectly with the sweet fruity quad notes. Fantastic!

In either case, this version - as opposed to the very elegant and complex Aurora Australis (a natural comparison) - seems slightly ""crude""; too sweet in an almond/marzipan kind of way and with a red wine hue on top which feels badly integrated.

2270,"2015-05-13",4.8,"Quadrupel Fra Nøgne Ø er en dessertøl på 15,5% og 30IBU. Kjøpt for 88,50,- NOK på Vinmonopolet på Linderud. Fargen på det minimalistiske skummet er lys beige. Fargen på ølen er uklar mørkebrunt, nærmest som kaffe. Karbonering er myk og under middels. Aromaen inneholder røde plummer, svisker, rødvin og en anelse rosin. Smaken består av røstet malt, rødvin, mørk sjokolade og relativt søt. Ettersmaken er søt og alkoholen har en varmende følelse. Flott kropp på ølen.","Oslo, NORWAY","BerZerK64"

2270,"2015-04-28",4.1,"Bottle at Home from Saveur-Biere.com - Color: really dark clear brown beer with no carbonation and really small brown head. Smell: caramel and brown sugar, malt domination and bread. Taste: very good taste of a quadrupel, total control of the style. Good caramel taste and bread. Caramel finish and brown sugar. Aftertaste: good caramel finish. For a 15,5 ABV you dont feel this level of alcohol. Good job !!!","FRANCE","sir__v"

2270,"2014-12-31",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2015 Cask, at Whats Brewing. A brown beer, lightly unclear, and more or less headless. It has a vinous aroma with a light touch of acetone. Chocolate, more like cocoa actually, some dark dried fruits and a touch of dark sugar too. The flavor is quite sweet, with a healthy dose of alcohol. Red wine, cocoa, prunes and some dark sugar. Full-bodied, warming and soft on the palate, the carbonation level going well with this kind of beer. Lasting finish. Sure, its a bit too warming, but its a delicious beer I was stupid enough to have several glasses of. Rating: 8-3-8-4-16-3.9.141031Bottle. Very close to one year since I drank the cask edition of this beer, I found the time to look closer into the bottled edition. It looks more or less the same, except it has a cute little beige head on top. Some lacings too. Its vinous on the nose, more rounded than it was a year ago, even some months ago, and rather complex. Cocoa, red wine, prunes and raisins, some alcohol, a woody scent and some brown sugar. Its sweet on the palate, not unexpected considering the ABV, but its far from cloying. The alcohol cleans up quite a bit. Red wine, cocoa, dark dried fruits, dark sugar and some tannins and vanilla-ish wood in the flavor. Theres bitterness present, but very subdued, and it feels only lightly warming on the palate. Full body and a very smooth carbonation. Chocolate, roasted notes, dark dried fruits, red wine, alcohol and sweetness in the finish. Certainly a beer that did well from a year of cellaring, and of course it looks more sexy from a bottle than from cask. Just wonderful this one, just wonderful. 151029","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
