AROMA: Strong fruity hop aroma, especially of berry and citrus. Some piney notes as well. Low amber malt sweetness. 10/12APPEARANCE: Reddish copper/amber. Clear. Large off white soapy foam retains and laces very well. 3/3FLAVOR: Well-balanced palette of equal parts malty sweetness and dank hop bitterness and flavor. Base has a caramel/toffee-like taste not unlike an amber ale. Bitterness is dank rather than dry. Hops create light fruity notes on the first half (berry and citrus) followed by piney/resiny/smokey notes on the backend. Light clean alcohol flavor is not distracting. Slight residual sweetness and some drying bitterness make for a fine aftertaste. 17/20MOUTHFEEL: Medium body and carbonation. Texture is fairly soft, but not chewy or velvety. Finishes smooth.

2699,"2016-09-23",4.6,"Can from Beer Cartel 200916. Just the thought of an Imperial Red IPA is enough to make you rip into this beer but at 8.7% ABV it is best to tread carefully. Looks like a hybrid red ale and IPA with a full head of thick looking foam and a russett copper colour that invites you in. The aroma is all malt, sweet caramel and toffee and the flavour is even more malt with vanilla, toffee and again that caramel. This beer is dangerously drinkable and I think that it would creep up on you and bite you if you didn¬ít give it the respect that it deserves.

It doesn¬ít pack as powerful as a punch that you would find with well known examples of west coast IPAs but the flavor is there no doubt.

A - Pours a hazy light brown with a small one finger white head that leaves light lacing down the glass.

T - Huge sweetness from the malt right off the bat. The piney hops pick up where the sweetness left off. Hop flavors are similar to the nose with the addition of citrus fruits such as orange, lemon, and grapefruit. Alcohol is hidden well but is present in the finish. The bitterness from the hops are a welcome addition to this overly sweet offering.

Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

Appearance ¬ñ Served an amber red color with a thin off white head. The head faded fast to leave a moderate amount of lacing.

Smell ¬ñ The smell was a wonderful balance of sweet tropical fruit (mango, pineapple and a lighter peach) and malt mixed with some citrus and floral hop aromas. Overall very balanced.

Taste ¬ñ The taste as was the nose was- very balanced. It started out on the sweeter side with a good deal of tropical fruit and some bready features. These are quickly meet with some hop flavors of citrus nature. As the taste moves on and the sweetness fades a bit, one is left with a hoppy citrus, pine and grassy hop flavor on the tongue. 

Mouthfeel ¬ñ The body is quite creamy with the carbonation level on the lover side. Both really help to accentuate the sweeter and hoppy flavors of the beer and suit it quite well.

Overall ¬ñ A delicious and very enjoyable red IPA. It has flavor, aroma and feel in a very balanced manner. A wonderful brew and definitely one to try.","","Darkmagus82"

T - 9 - The taste is basically the same as the smell, like a nice, sweet citrus juice. The hops are so citrusy - with mango, papaya, pineapple, orange juice. The malt is so sweet with a nice caramely/sugary taste in the background. Sooo sweet, but not too sweet.

The masterful taste profile is complex and well balanced. It begins with the hop flavors of the nose, flows into a mild bitterness and ends with caramel sweetness.

Lots of hops with a lot tropical fruit notes and a mix of pine and floral hops. There is some citrus and sweetness for a variety of fruits, as well as some medium strength grapefruit and some caramel that gets more pronounced as you go on.

2699,"2013-09-17",3.6,"16 oz. can drunk straight. ¬íCourse, I poured a little into a regular glass to see what¬ís what.

A: Pours a radiant copper color. The head is a one finger offwhite shade featuring a soft texture and acceptable retention. This one leaves behind a nice streak of lacing as is - I can¬ít imagine how much it would leave poured into a full pint glass.

S: About what I expected: plenty of caramel malt sweetness, backed by some floral/piny hops. Black pepper and resin also pop up after a few whiffs. Standard, but well done.

T: Again, no real surprises in the flavor profile, except perhaps for the balance achieved. The hop flavors (no citrus/tropical fruit here, it¬ís all pine/floral/peppery) are strongest right before the finish, yet they never create a harsh spike of bitterness. The opening maltiness is typical: caramel, toffee, marzipan, earth, and maybe a touch of nut. Well balanced, almost to a fault - there¬ís little here to blow the mind, but the approachability is top-notch.

M: There is a decent dryness on the back end, which (somewhat) quashes the sweeter malts. Personally, it¬ís a tad undercarbonated for me, helping to create a touch of undesirable syrupiness at times - still, this one is easy drinking.

O: These amber/red ales (barring Nugget Nectar) never really do it for me. Having said that, this is a quality brew with a level of drinkability belying its 8.7% strength. Good one, but it¬ís a red...meaning this won¬ít be a regular in my fridge.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

A - looks amazing. Red/amber color with 2 fingers off white head that dissipates to 1 finger of lumpy head. Lacing the glass already without even taking a sip. Each swig leaves a perfect ring of lacing on the glass. 

S - Citrusy/floral hops balanced by caramel/bready malts. Little bit of brown sugar in there too. 

T - Sweet. A lot of caramel malt w/ nice hop fruitiness. A lot of orange/lemon/lime flavors along w/ strawberry in there. The ""red"" part of the ipa is giving a smoother and sweeter taste with this one, which I like. 

M - Light-medium. Carbonation is light-medium too. Alcohol completely hidden. Leaves a light bitter/fruity flavor from the hops in your mouth. 

O - Great beer. I love this beer and I think it's nearly as good as Ten FIdy. The fact that Oskar Blues cans their beers makes them portable almost anywhere, which is another important aspect. Within it's genre it's probably the best red IPA I've had.

Appearance: Like any other Oskar Blues product, crystal clear. This one has a color you¬íd expect -- red. The head is off-white, meringue-like, and about a finger high. Lacing is spotty but nice.
Smell: A very nice blend of hops, and it¬ís hard to pinpoint one aroma that I¬ím getting out of it ... the ""aftersmell"" is super sweet, which is the best part about it. After digging for a little while, I finally decided that this beer has a pretty significant pineapple and tropical fruit aroma.
Taste: Malty flavors coat the mouth quite a bit thanks to the fact that this is a red, but the intense amount of hops balance that sweetness extremely well. Peppery, spicy hops burn the back of the tongue just a little bit, and I find that it¬ís a great way to make sure the malt isn¬ít too dominant. The finish is a tad bitter, but the front is pretty sweet, so again, very nice balance here overall.
Feel: The feel on this one is nearly perfect -- it¬ís a pretty big beer (ABV wise and someone heavy in the feel as well), and it almost drinks like a meal. At the same time, the drinkability on this one is crazy high.
Overall: This could be my favorite Oskar Blues offering. Dale¬ís Pale is a great pale ale with a refreshing hop kick, Mama¬ís Little Yella is a must-try for anybody that¬ís a Bud Light only person (since it has a pretty light, but solid flavor), Deviant Dale¬ís is a huge, burning, whale of an IPA... but G¬íKnight is just better, despite how good all of those beers are.

2699,"2013-03-10",2.9,"Appear: clear amber pour with huge 2"" head that was white with orange/red hue. 

Aroma: very light aroma. Sweet citrus and maybe a little rye, very pleasant. 

Taste: pretty Light. Bitter, biscuity malt and rye hop flavor.

Palate: medium body. A little sticky. Finish is fairly clean. Leaves faint but complex flavor, rye for sure but perhaps more like pure caraway seeds. Interesting.

Overall: okay beer. Not worth the price of admission in my eyes. Needs stronger scent and flavor. Rye flavor more like caraway is notable.

Glass: Tulip
Canned on 4/28/11
Pours a 2cm head of off-white foam, densely packed small bubbles, very good retention.  Gradually falls to a thick ring around the glass with an island of foam atop the center of the body.  Leaves copious, thick lacing along sides of glass.  Body is semi-hazy red-brown in color, with light causing a transition to a palette of orange-brown with yellow highlights.  Carbonation is readily visible from the bottom of the glass.
Aroma of sweet, toffee-like malts with a delicious fresh, mango-apricot-grapefruit semi-bitter hop aroma.
Pleasant toffee, nutty malt with a strong grapefruit and citrus hop edge, the sweetness well-balanced by the bitterness.  Bitterness becomes noticeably pronounced at mid-palate, then declines from the back of the palate on, with malt sweetness taking over as more noticeable.  Faint ethanol in the close, leading to a lingering aftertaste of well-balanced malt sweetness and hop bitterness.
Beer is medium-heavy to heavy bodied, expected for an ¬ìimperial¬î style, with mid-level carbonation that manages to propel this along the palate very nicely.  Finish is dry and slightly sticky along the palate and lips.","Wyoming, USA","tibicinoid"

2699,"2012-03-05",3.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 6/28/2011.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip.

Gordon pours a full orange color with a raspberry tint throughout. Mostly transparent, a medium sized eggshell head leaves nice lacing down the glass. 

I appreciate a brew where I don¬ít need to waft and dip my nose in, the aroma just bursts right out of the can. Gordon does this. A ton of caramel comes through, with a good blend of citrus hoppiness - orange, grapefruit, and a bit of lemon. 

The flavor starts out incredibly sweet; I nearly overdose on the caramel malt. There is a light solventy character that steps in right after the sweetness, which I don¬ít care for. Grapefruit, orange, and a good amount of spruce give this a solid hop profile, with a light lingering bitterness. 

The body is a little bit light consdering this is an ¬íimperial.¬í Medium carbonation, lots of sticky resin coats my mouth after each hoppy sip.

The intense sweetness is a little bit much for me, even with the huge load of citrusy, resiny hops.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Hops are citrusy with emphasis on orange and grapefruit. Malts are full of caramel flavor and dark fruitiness like a barleywine. I smell lots of cherries and plums.

4.0 T: Initially this beer had me scratching my head. I didn¬ít know what the hell I was tasting. The malts (or maybe the hops) put a ""chalky"" flavor on the tip of my tongue, which isn¬ít necessarily unpleasant. The malts were a big disappointment as it wasn¬ít as complex as I would have liked.

2699,"2010-07-18",3.9,"First off this beer looks great. Bright reddish orange topped by a thick creamy head that retains throughout. While not overwhelmingly bursting with hoppy citrus aromas, the smell harmonizes fresh hop pine and sweetness resulting in an enticing and refreshing nose. I expected a mouthful of sticky hop bitterness, but was pleasantly surprised by a full load of caramel maltiness. Toffee, buttery biscuit malt flavors orchestrate the palate and are gracefully followed by a sharp hoppy aftertaste. Though I am typically less fond of malts overshadowing hops in an IPA, this dynamic works well for me. The soft piney hop flavors play off the caramel malt sweetness with a unique likeability. The beer feels smooth and rich and is quite drinkable. I can¬ít say I¬ím blown away, but definitely another impressive offering from Oskar Blues.","Pennsylvania, USA","sarahmarie"

The taste is similar to the aroma, however the bitter hops come out much more in the taste compared to the aroma which I thought was fruitier and sweeter.

And then, enter G¬íKnight in 2011.

G¬íKnight, 25 whole IBUs less bitter, is just as good.  It still boasts a dark orange color, but the body of the beer seems to have improved.  Its off-white head is thicker, stickier, and leaves behind gorgeous, thick lacing.  The aroma is of a soft, but acutely refreshing bouquet of gorgeous hops, coupled with the dark caramel sweetness of crystal malts.  It¬ís thin in the mouth, but extremely refreshing and easy to drink, leaving you with a sharp finish of bold, fresh hop cones and alcohol.  It feels like a hop flower has actually gotten stuck in my sinuses.  Ah, heaven.  The thick sweetness is well-balanced by the beer¬ís thin body and alcohol presence, and a great flavor profile of hops decorates the whole experience quite awesomely.  It¬ís an incredibly delicious beer and worthy of representing.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

2699,"2010-05-27",4.0,"I poured this 12 oz can (natch) into a snifter, the better to observe its deep orange-umber body and noticeable lacing. The beer raised a fleeting one-inch head, then settled into its attractive body. The nose is from the grassy side of hops rather than the citrus side (if that makes sense), but it¬ís clear that there are more than enough hops here to counteract the heavy malt spine. This goes down smoothly, with a lingering malt sweetness washing away both the hop bitterness and the abv burn. Without a doubt, this is my favorite offering from Oskar Blues.","Athens, Georgia, USA","bjt512"

Taste is right on with a wonderfully mellow palate, followed by lovely finish with just a tad bit of boozy taste.  This is a fantastic brew!  It is similar to Gubna, just not as much citrus, and the hops are there for taste, not to prickle the skin.

Not super bitter but consistently hoppy across the palate with a very subdued and light malt. Its not a resiny as a lot of DIPAs but the hops are still the the star of the show, staying fresh and piny on the tongue.

Absolutely among the best IPAs I had so far, it really does a great job at keeping a nice balance without muddling the flavours.

T- Citrus hops are first with a big grapefruit taste. The malt backing is strong and has a caramel character with hints of chocolate. The initial taste is smooth and well balanced. The finish is nearly all caramel malt with minimal hop bitterness. Sweet bready caramel malt lingers.

M- Low carbonation and rather thick body. Goes down smooth.

D- Great hybrid beer. The DIPA/ strong red combination really works here. Its got a big malty character with good hop flavor. Very easy to drink and the ABV is almost undetectable. Something I will have again.

I¬íve never had a canned craft beer before so this just seems weird.
Pours orange/amber color with a thumb worth of off white creamy head with above average retention.

Lots of candied hoppy goodness in the nose. Some tropical pineapple and sugar covered orange peel.

Lots of sweetness up front. Candy and sugared orange peel is the best i can explain it. A touch of pineapple too. In the finish there is a touch of bitterness and some mango-ish aftertaste.

Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and creamy. Little to no carbonation.

Drinkability is high. The 8.7%abv is verywell masked. I feel like i could drink a few of these. I would probably be tanked but its super easy to get down.

Overall, i was impressed with this canned beer. For a DIPA is leans a lot more towards the malty spectrum. I definitely prefer more of a hop bite but i can¬ít really say to much negative about it. Its smooth crisp and tasty. I would recommend this one to anybody and would definitely drink it again.","Pennsylvania, USA","BigMike"

Amber color with a small off-white head. Some lacings.

The smell is hoppy with notes ofpine-needles, grapefruit, caramel and vanilla. Rather balanced aroma actually.

2699,"2009-07-30",4.2,"Well, I have enjoyed this beer for a couple years now so here is one of my less-than-stellar reviews. Nice amber red color with a head that alludes to the gravity of the beer. Smells like fresh pines and hops. The taste is also very piney, hoppy with some tropical fruit flavors and reminds me a lot of Yulesmith winter. These two beers are helping me understand why people call them ""Imperial Red"" ales; they are much more malty than a standard DIPA but they still have a super hop element. This is definitely my favorite beer from Oskar Blues

Aroma is very pleasant as its hard to keep my nose away from the glass, but does not strike me as a true iipa, but more of American strong ale.  A bunch of fruits, melons, citrus, grapefruit, heavy fruits like dates, medium fruits like apples, also with a good nutty caramel and cereal grains.  The pour is decent, small creamy smooth head, little carbonation, decent lacing and retention, good clarity with a medium body, and good rusty orange color.  Tasting this beer confirms my belief that this is more toward the imperial amber side of the description, but no matter what you want to call it, there¬ís a bunch of quality things going on in this beer.  Balance is superb and the flavors here go very well together.  Rich roasted cereals malts and nutty caramel come up right away, paving the way for more some heavier fruits like melons, thicker citrus with lemony grapefruit, minor spices alongside some darker fruits, and then a finish that is more herbal earth and light citrus that still maintains some of the melon and other malty starting qualities to make a fairly wet and sticky linger.

Flavor is very well-blended, a pleasing mix of bitter and sweet all the way through. A little alcohol comes through. Pretty smooth, as well. Definitely well-made, though there isn¬ít anything particularly amazing that I¬ím finding in this brew.

Sweet, resiny, citrus flavor.  Smooth and hoppy, this one is very easy drinking.  Alcohol is very well hidden. Nowhere near as big as other DIPAs out there.

2699,"2009-03-19",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 19, 2012 Original Rating (3/19/2009): 12oz can. Pours a deep copper red color and see-through body with a big, two finger-width, soapy foamy, off-white head that takes forever to dissipate and leaves a lot of lacing. Lots to this aroma, just not as BIG as most DIPA¬ís. Lots of caramels and mild citrus hops. Lots of different kinds of fruits including grapefruits, sweet clementines, peaches, and melons. Some wood character to it and pine needles. Flavor is very round and sweet. Sweet bready and caramel malts give this a very full body while the mild, but piney citrus hops balance this out nicely. Some of the melon creeps in there along with the citrus. Finishes malty, slightly piney and woody, with lots of mild hop linger. Overall, lots of hop taste, but not the explosion like most DIPA¬ís. I like that about this. Its very flavorful, but subdued. I also love the fantastic soft body. Really nice stuff right here (7,4,8,5,16=4.0). Re-Rate (9/19/2012): 12oz can that I found buried in my cellar. So old it still says ""Gordon"" on the label with a stamped on canned on date of 10/17/09. Well...lets see how a 3 year old DIPA holds up. Okay...I¬ím not going to re-rate this, but its held up surprisingly well. Not nearly as well as my original rating, but still pretty tasty. The malts are still fairly sweet, but have a nice, caramelized breadiness giving off a slight toffee sugar note. There is still a decent amount of orange and grapefruit citruses, but the melon fruits and peaches certainly come through still. It finishes sweet and malty, but well balanced with a drier bitterness, despite the hops being a bit bland when it comes to flavor. Lengthy aftertaste following a full, somewhat chewy body and a creamy, medium-light carbonation. Overall, my shock at finding 2(!) cans of this in my cellar can only be topped by how drinkable and enjoyable it is after  3 years. Full bodied and malty with a nice caramelized aspect, yet bitter enough to balance without any of the stale hop taste I was expecting. Alright!","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
2699,"2009-03-16",3.7,"can thanks to boomer0813.  poured an dark amberish color with a soapy beige head that left ample lacing.  aroma was a sweet buttery caramel and some pine resin.  flavor was pine resin, hops, and some alcohol on the backend.  medium body with medium-high carbonation.  this was a good offering from oskar blues.","Denton, Texas, USA","Rosebud butternuts"
2699,"2009-03-10",3.6,"Canned. Nice lacy head and deep amber color. more hops on the nose than malt which is true for the taste as well. Definetley a hybrid with its hoppiness, but also a red with the distinctive malt they are known for. At 8.7% you wouldnt know it unless told ecspecialy when it is so light bodied and easy to drink.

2699,"2009-03-09",3.8,"While good craft beer does come in a can, that doesn¬ít mean I have to drink it out of the can if I don¬ít have to, and so I lovingly pour Gordon into my awaiting glass. Gordon exits his canned confines thick, syrupy, and deep umber red, quite a promising prelude of quaffing to come. A small head of perfection tops her off while lace clings stubbornly to the sides of her new home. Gordon puffs on command, releasing an explosion of sap, pine, hop oils and resin, orange peel, cut grass and spring flowers. Like a lab rat upon command, my mouth starts to water and I raise her deep amber depths to my lips for our very first kiss. A full mouthfeel thoroughly coats all inner surfaces as she goes down sweet and sticky with a crisp hop finish. My first impression is of honey, orange, and melon backed by caramel, malts, and toast. Following second are a plethora of hop delights; grass, pine, oils, and sap all ensconced in soft floral notes. Wait, did I just pour this out of a can? Why yes, Kristyn, there really is such a thing as a good canned beer. All hope of personal restraint gone, I hungrily enjoy every single swallow and sip of my Gordon from Oskar Blues. As he warms and I near the end of my glass, a network of laces marks his path while my mouth remains a sticky smorgasbord of orange pulp, grass, pine, and new to the mix, some grapefruit. Finishing her off is a solid balance of toasted and caramel malts.


I could pour Gordon blind for anyone and they would never guess he came from a can. As easy as it can be to cast aside prejudices and misconceptions, it can be as equally hard to let them go, consciously or subconsciously, when the price tag is the same as a 6 pack of bottled craft beer. But we are America, land of the free, the brave, and finally of damn good canned craft beer. Fear not the unknown, and instead embrace your inner can freak. Heck, it¬ís even good for the environment, along with your tastebuds, of course.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

2699,"2009-03-06",3.9,"Enjoyed via 12oz can.  Pours a deep copper.  Aroma is strong; one of American hops (Cascade, Centennial, Amarillo?).  Palate is pretty thoroughly dominated by hops, as one might expect.  However, nice notes of malt in the finish keep this example from being overly hoppy.  A dry finish makes it dangerously drinkable.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

Aroma dominated by orange, tangerine, nectarine, and a touch of tartness.  Flavor is unexpectedly sweet; at first sip I really am not sure what to make of this.  Where did all the hops go?  Carbonation is under-average, and mid-body emerges surprisingly mild.  Finish descends delicately back towards crushed-hop bitterness, but stops short of becoming sharply so.  Sweet fruit also lends good balance to the finishing palate.  BUT, as a hophead, I say leave the word ¬ìbalance¬î at the door.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"

Taste is characterized initially by those unique piney/floral hops and flowing quickly to biscuity/caramel malts, some sugary sweet spices, citrus, and chocolate pop up and this finishes mostly sweet and bitter.

Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, thick and oily texture coats the mouth, moderate carbonation.

Drinkability is moderate, I would like to have seen more of a hop presence here but it scores points for balance, the sweet profile is a little strange (like chocolate and candy mixed) and detracts a bit from drinking in larger quantities, i like Gordon but it definitely falls behind Dale‚Äôs and Old Chubb IMHO.","San Diego, California, USA","BrotherGrendel"

2699,"2008-08-17",4.1,"Four 12oz cans purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston for $12.  It‚Äôs not too often I get to enjoy Oskar Blues beers after having an Old Chubb explode in my checked suitcase on a flight.  But I was spending a full week in Boston this time, so I took the opportunity to drink some cans while in town.  I had to choose between the Gordon or the Ten Fidy, and was in a hop mood.  Pours a clear dark red with a big fluffy head and a hoppy aroma I can smell from over a foot away.  A plethora of lacing.  The flavour is well balanced with a solid malt base and hops that linger long after the beer is swallowed.  Taste is perhaps slightly lighter than expected for the alcohol level, but it‚Äôs still a nice bold brew.  I was planning to say that the beer perhaps didn‚Äôt warrant its $3/can pricetag, but this last one is making me rethink that.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","sstackho"

Hoppy nose; very pleasant if not utterly complex.  Loads of citrus and light pine.  A little sweet smelling.  Great balance of hops and malt... waaay too drinkable for an almost 9% beer.

2699,"2008-07-14",3.7,"Huh. How did I miss rating this? Can from Market Street Wineshop Downtown Charlottesville. The following is my review from cvillebeergeek.blogspot.com 


Appearance: Pours a dark, dark amber with a medium sized frothy head. The head doesn‚Äôt stick around but leaves a thick layer of lacing around the glass. This has the look of an imperial IPA. 4.0/5.0

Aroma: Big hop profile... mostly citrus but also some pine. Big hops, but not too assertive. Fairly well balanced. 3.5/5.0

Taste: The hops come through right up front. They have an assertive but soft character. This is balanced fairly well by a nice malty sweetness. I can‚Äôt detect any of the ""canniness"" that Chris fears so much. Still, there seems to be something missing. 3.5/5.0

Mouthfeel: The hops are strong, but not too sharp. That being said, if you‚Äôre not a fan of hoppy beers, this probably won‚Äôt be your cup of tea. Medium body with a sticky, oily texture. 4.0/5.0

Drinkability: The relatively high alcohol content is well hidden, and if you are a ""hop head,"" this one goes down easy. That being said, this is not a beer for the uninitiated. The stickyness leads to a heavy, warm feeling in the belly after a while. 4.0/5.0

Overall: 3.70/5.00. This is a good beer, but not outstanding. That being said, it‚Äôs the best beer I‚Äôve ever had out of a can. That being said, that‚Äôs not saying all that much. That being said, it‚Äôs still a mighty fine beer. It is a bit pricy. I can‚Äôt remember exactly, but I think I paid $3.69 for it at Market Street Wine Shop downtown.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"

It poured out beautifully, looking dark and rich like a barleywine with a very nice thick head.  Aroma left me a bit concerned about what this beer would taste like it was fruity but very malty, to the point of being cereal-y.  And the flavor was dominated by cereal maltiness, but I also detected some very nice flavor notes that reminded me of pears and cotton candy.  However, the malt backbone was definitely the dominant flavor.  Mouthfeel was rich and sticky and pretty good.  This beer followed a Stone Ruination, and maybe it just seems lack-luster by comparison, or my expectations (I thought it was a DIPA) were poorly oriented.

2699,"2008-06-10",4.0,"12 ounce can. Who knew that beer from a can could be so damn good?

The pour delivered a translucent copper-red body, an orange aura, and a thin white head. The lacing was good.

The nose was of caramel, graham cracker, orange, and a wee bit of alcohol. The flavor was of bitter orange, more orange than grapefruit. This was offset by light caramel, graham cracker, and an alcohol flavor that could almost convince me that Gordon was aged in oak casks. The alcohol bordered on lightly varnished wood, in a pleasing way. On the finish, there is a hint of sugary sweetness that reminds me of cotton candy. As Gordon warms, a faint grassiness emerges, both in the nose and in the palate.

The ale engages the entire mouth. In addition, the alcohol presence gave Gordon a minor ""heat"" that rests in the esophagus and upper stomach.

I liked this ale a lot. It was described as ""a dry-hopped hybrid strong ale somewhere between a Double IPA and and Imperial Amber Ale,"" and I think this is an accurate assessment. I liked the complexity of aroma and flavor. I liked its assertiveness. I liked that it is named Gordon. I will be having this again.

I will, however, probably have to rethink my whole ""better out of a bottle"" philosophy. I expect some canned craft beer exploration is in order.","Washington, USA","troysworktable"

When poured, it immediately releases lots of resiny and piney aromas, and a deeper investigation reveals a heavy maltyness, quite sweetish, and some citrus. It took me some time to let the aromas have a break and let the beer slip between my lips and teeth. Well, it sort of cleaned the teeth when passing, and without being all bitter, it soaked my tongue with sweetness for a starter, a wonderful balanced main course and a bitter dessert. And to top it, there was a little sweet to finish it. There were pine, citrus, resin, sugar and maltyness, but when swallowing, the hops givinig it its 85 IBUs claimed it¬ís rights to dominate. The amount of malt sure did its thing too, giving it a full body and a little stickyness in the mouth. It was a quite balanced beer, but sure on the hoppy side, and sure a treat.

2007-12-XX. Orangey amber body with a  small frothy beige head. (3+) Surprising amount of hops in the aroma, green and earthy, leafy. (6+) flavour has a decent amount of bitterness. Something about the malt profile I do not care for, or perhaps its the combination of the caramel malt character with the hops. I know I have tasted something similar before but do not know where.

Thanks to Beerlando for sending me this as a bonus in a recent trade.  I have seen it on the shelves before but never picked it up because of the cost.  I¬ím not likely to buy anymore for the same reason but it was an excellent release.  If you have someone to split a six-pack with this is worth trying.
Aroma / Appearance - The orangish-red body was fairly unusual after a number of Christmas ales and imperial stouts.  A short lived white ash head laced the top before collapsing in on itself.  Sticky chunks of lacing clung to the sides of my snifter.  The hoppiness was very strong but unable to totally overpower the combination of chocolate and oranges.  Glazed Krispy Kreme donuts sitting in a freshly painted room summarizes the experience nicely.
Flavor / Palate - Hopped up lemon meringue bars stand out first.  The bitterness and maltiness play against each other in stages.  First one will stand out before the other comes forward for a few seconds.  Finally after a while the vanilla, peach and pine finish wraps things up.  The mouthfeel is creamy (like Cool Whip).  This beer falls somewhere between a typical Imperial IPA and American Strong Ale like Arrogant Bastard.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Soft pleasing dark and rich aroma of slightly dried caramel malt, candish to a point, with a pinch of dried floral hoppiness, pine dust, and some dark fruity oils.

Nice well-rounded tone, flavor, and profile for a Dbl. IPA. Actually this is quite yummy with a good portion of medium fronted caramel candyness wrapped in a whirlwind of light dryishness, mild toasted grain, dark fruity raisin skin touches, and some floral hints and plenty of oily hoppynessa and pine hints with a titch of citrus-like pithy bitterenss to finish it off. 

Feel is quite smooth, rich, creamy, oily, with just the right kind of buzz of dryness and bitterness flying about within the malty realm of ggodness. A soaking enrichment of caramel and slightly toasted malt fills the palate while the hops add some attractive qualities of dark flowery oils and citric pithy dryness. 

A pleasantly unique and damn fine Dbl. IPA here. Nothing overwhemling here and at 8.7% makes it low on the scale of ABV for a beer that tastes as big as this.

Following Oakes¬í suggestion, I let this one warm to 55 degrees or more before tasting. It pours deep red with an ample fluffy head.

Gordon pours with an amber body with glowing orange highlights when backlit. A creamy one finger beige head formed on the pour that fell to a half finger while leaving sheet lacing that slowly falls back into the body leaving some stragglers.

Much bigger malt backbone than I expected. Huge caramel malt, actually some of the best smelling sweetest caramel malts I can recall. Juicy brown sugar sweetened grapefruit juice. Fairly simple and straight forward but delicious.

The can says this beer is ""Big. Red. Sticky."" Couldn¬ít have been said any better. Much like the aroma the flavor has that huge sweet smooth caramel maltiness. Brown sugar sweetened grapefruit add another layer of sweetness along with a mild bittering component. I¬ím usually more into the hop bombs but this is a masterful cretion of maltiness.

Medium bodied with an incredible lush smoothness. Slight alcohol fumes rise on the finish. Fantastic mouthfeel.

An incredibly easy drinking high abv beer. This beer would be in constant rotation if I lived in their distrobution area.

Another great beer from Oskar Blues. I¬íve tried three of their offering and everyone was great, not just good, great. Keep canning these brews, I want to try them all.

Some lemon cookies and citruses. The body/mouth feel is a bit lacking. There¬ís definitely lots of malt in the flavor though, giving it a slightly slick mouth feel. The hops are there yet don¬ít seem as robust as the aroma. Some what strange papery resin-ish finish. The flavors aren¬ít bad, but seem subdued or restrained somehow.

2699,"2007-06-21",3.7,"Can.  Ruby red pour with auburn highlights.  The big rich fruity nose reminds me of a barleywine.  A lot of hops in the flavor from beginning to end with fruit tones of cherry and ripe red grape in layers below.  The finishing hops add an almost rose petal while the bittering hops completely obscure the 8.7% ABV.  Very rich full flavor, but the body is only a medium-plus, so it¬ís not quite as ""sticky"" as the label indicates, but it does make it surprisingly refreshing for an American strong ale.  On a side note, as the beer breathed, the nose and palate seemed to reverse - the nose becoming all hop, while the flavor became more fruity.  This kept the beer complex and interesting through to the end.","Winter Springs, Florida, USA","jdhunt76"

2699,"2007-06-18",4.3,"Pours a deep amber with one and a helf finger head that settles slowly to a thick cap. The foam leaves behind a nice sheeting of lace.

Smell; piney hop resins with grapefruit and oranges shining through as well. Some nice caramel malt sweetness is present, with a very nice floral aroma floating around the fringes.

Taste; grapefruit and oranges dominate, but the pine is present right behind and there¬ís some other tropical fruits mixed in. Very hoppy, but not crushingly so. The malts do just enough to balance out the hops a little with some caramel and brown sugar. It¬ís a bit sweeter than I expected, but it seems to fit this beer very well.

Mouthfeel is fully bodied and oh so smooth and creamy. This is one of the smoothest beers that I¬íve had in a while, and that only increases the drinkability for me. I picked this up at total wine and more is Sterling, Va and I¬ím glad I finally had a chance to try it.

Smell: Ahh, finally an assertive nose demanding of one¬ís attention! Pacific Northwest hops bring pine and, to a lesser extent, grapefruit to the table, while the malts deliver some caramel, biscuitiness, and maybe even some brown sugar, too.

Taste: Begins with a sweet butterscotch maltiness that¬ís quickly succeeded by a myriad of fruit flavors including grapefruit, peaches, and blood oranges. Eventually, the pine and grassy hop flavors show up to welcome in the bitter, dry (but still somewhat sweet) finish.

Settling down quickly. Huge hop aroma typical hoppy IPA. Pine, citrus and caramel. Very smooth body and low carbonation. A bit chewy. Chocolate malt hit me right away, followed by intense bitter hops. Wow! Lots of hops in this one. Reminds me of fresh Bigfoot. Malt definitely present in flavor especially chocolate in the finish.

2699,"2007-03-30",3.7,"Tried from both draft and can today. Pours a copper-amber color with a very generous head. Lacing is about as good as it gets for an imperial ipa. The aroma was grapefruits and pine, light floral. The flavor followed suit, some resinous overtones that seemed to come out more in the aftertaste. With increasing temperatures, the malts got a little too strong, somewhat sweet and fruity, oranges and other light fruits and melons mixed in there. The mouthfeel was the main distinguishable difference between the tap and can, little creamier from the can (almost nitrogen-like), yet on par for the style from both. A nice but not excellent dIPA.","","User37895"

That same soapy malt flavor that the Dale¬ís has.  Comes off a bit flat.  No alcohol whatsoever.  No bitterness.  Tastes like an amber.  Rich caramel malt.  A little spicy, floral hops.  None of the sharp hop flavor I get from cascades; completely smoothed out by the malt.

The head was large and ""dry;"" it kind of floated atop the beer itself and moved around independently of it.

2699,"2007-03-23",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 17, 2007 12 oz. can. Hops dominate the superb aroma, which features lemon, pine, pomegranate, and grass notes. Pours a clear golden brown with a large amount of thick, uneven, cream/tan-colored head. Produces extensive lacing. The beautiful foam rivals that of top Belgians, but the liquid is rather ordinary in appearance. The taste is not nearly as hoppy as the aroma implies and is in fact very malty. The alcohol is noticeable but not overpowering or offputting. Soapy yeast elements complement the sweet carmel malt. Medium-bodied, smooth, and undercarbonated in the palate. Easy to drink. If a typical good amber ale is pleasant, then this ""imperial"" amber ale is very pleasant. Oskar Blues Gordon is memorable, unique, and exciting.

A reddish orange body with a tight bubbled creamy head with excellent lacing noted.  I also detect some caramel malts in the nose.  Flavor is not as hoppy and more malt forward, but regardless this is a very well balanced brew.  I¬ím thinking this is why it is categorized as an American strong ale vs. IIPA.  RIP Gordon Knight, they made a nice brew for you.  One last note...did I detect some mint?? in the finish.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"

He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado. Cheers to you Gordon. Pours a brilliant redish/orange with a huge frothy dirty white head. The aroma is hops, raisin, bready malt, and pine/herbal hops. The flavor doesn¬ít quite match up to the robustness of the aroma. Some herbal hop flavor going on with some earth notes. Pine and metallic notes make up the finish. The mouthfeel is a little sticky with some alcohol warming. Body is solid. Good hop character all around.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","eboats"

And the beer hides it¬ís alcohol deftly and with good higher alcohol support of the beer. It finishes clean and feels light and heavily drinkable.

Taste is somewhat sweet with very bready malts balancing gently with piney-herbal hops.  A bit thinner than expected.  It could be my imagination, but I do detect just a hint of metal in the aftertaste - I guess I¬íll have to try this on tap.  Definitely the best canned beer I¬íve ever had.  I¬ím just a bit confused as this beer was originally under the DIIPA category if I remember right.  Like Troegs Nugget Nectar, it calls itself ""Imperial Amber"", and I have to say its similar in many ways, but doesn¬ít quite match the superior NN in my opinion.

2699,"2007-03-15",4.0,"My new favorite canned beer!  A lovely warm clear amber with an offwhite head, thin. The nose is rather ridiculous.  Big nasty herbal resin.  The nose has some malt, but it just barely matches the herbal green hops.  Full and rich in the mouth, creamy and a bit sticky.  Really very nice.  The flavor are unfortunately a cut below the aroma, but mostly because this beer is so out of balance it isn¬ít even funny.  But it still is delicious.  Creamy green hop resin with a bit of sweet light malt.  This malt would need to be so round and sweet and cloying to balance the fresh resinous piney tones here that it would probably not really be all that drinkable, so it¬ís a double edged sword.  It¬ís not that this beer is bitter, or for that matter hoppy.  It¬ís that the hops that are here (in abundance) taste and smell exceedingly fresh.  There¬ís a little diacetyl in the finish, but I won¬ít hold that against it as the aftertaste becomes big with lingering hop resin shortly thereafter, and in a rather clean way.  As this warms, it loses its balance more so, getting more boozy and less malty.  Still a great brew.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

The flavor hits the senses with citrus hops. The moment you have enough time to sense and identify the hops a wide truck load of sweet, roasted and hints of biscuit malts take over the flavor. Yes, sizable malt. Then as the malts recede away the tasty citrus hops re-surface and usher you into the aftertaste.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

The body is full, sticky, and smacking with every penny of the high price tag.  The palate is long coated with this nectar and finishes more bitter, tacky, and pithy than dry or quick.  Now, call me crazy, but it seems that this beer has changed over the recent months.  The first cans I had were the sublime, full, sticky, and nearly perfect IIPAs I¬íve just described.  These were the can¬ís that first showed up in NJ and had a white adhesive label claiming 9.2 percent abv, but recently new fangled cans have arrived and the beer is absolutely not the same stuff.  Maybe it¬ís just batch inconsistency, but there¬ís also a curious change in that the abv appears to have decreased a half percent in recent months.

Flavor is citrus, oranges, pine, and an ending sweetness brought on by the cookie malts. The flavor ends pretty easy on the palate with no big taste of the alcohol or bitterness.

The nose is not as much of a bitter onslaught as I¬íd hope for, but it is certainly tasteful in its hoppy glory. Plenty of fresh, grassy scents and thick caramel are present along with citrus and faint cigar smoke. The malty foundation in this almost, almost, hints at a scotch ale with a bit of tobacco and earth. But, that¬ís easily overlooked with the robust caramel and tangy grapefruit and pine flavors. Body is sticky to balance out the acidity.

The jasmine in the aroma is definately there in the flavor too, which seems like a really unusual flavor component for an IIPA.

2699,"2007-01-13",3.7,"Courtesy of brewblackhole. Nice color, reddish amber and you can¬ít see through it. The head was there, not really thing per se (like an impy. stout or barley wine), just not really thick. The aroma is nice, piney and spicy hop, definitely smell bitterness, some malty sweetness. Wonderfully balanced aroma. However, I¬íve recently had several beers that let me down with taste after putting up a wonderful aroma so we¬íll see. Ok, tastes like a powerful IPA, makes sense, definitely bitter and dry, but it has a sweet fruit background to it thats appreciable. I rarely like something that is bitter to be bitter and the fact that this does something else makes me appreciate it. The palate was actually pretty harsh at first, waxy and attackingly bitter, but as you drink more it mellows out. The finish follows suite, bitter and a tad bit warm, this is the only area the supposed 9.2% comes in.

2699,"2007-01-08",4.0,"What is that I see floating amongst the bottles in my sea of craft beer?  Do my eyes deceive me or is that a CAN of beer?!  I believe it is!  How did that get in there?!  Wait, it¬ís a can of Oskar Blues Gordon...

I must admit that it feels a bit awkward pouring a Double IPA from a can into a tulip glass.  What is the can but a vessel to get it from the brewery to my mouth anyways?!  Who said great beer needs to come in a bottle?  After all, cans are lighter, cheaper, and more picnic friendly.  Wouldn¬ít it be great to take some really good beer such as this one on a camping or canoe trip with you and not have to worry about and deal with glass bottles?!  Hell yeah!  Now, back ti the actual rating...

Oskar Blues Gordon pours in a silky stream.  It is a clear red-copper color and has a creamy ivory head that settles down to a frothy crown that sticks to the glass (nice lacing).  A super fresh citrus and piney hops aroma bursts from the glass.  Further inspection reveals a sweet, caramel maltiness.  Oh, how the aroma draws me in!  That same sweet caramel maltiness is even deeper in the flavor.  It is also packed full of massive hop flavor (pine, some citrus peel) and bitterness (aggressive, yet smooth and pleasing).  A bit of complimentary alcohol comes through in the finish and is a good reminder of the higher alcohol content (8.7% ABV) of this fine brew.  Gordon is on the thicker side and clings to everything - the glass, your mouth, your tongue, and your throat!  It has a mild level of carbonation that makes it soft, smooth, and creamy on the palate.  Overall this beer is well balanced between its deep maltiness and bold hoppiness.  I would love to have a canned beer this good to throw in the backpack for trips!  --

By the way, I also snuck a few sips from the can just to see what it was like.  That too was a strange feeling - drinking a Double IPA directly from a can!  Regardless, it was pretty damn good straight from the can.  Why even bother pouring it?!  Well, the beautiful color is worth the pour...

Its flavourful as hell with the fresh leafy hop tannins coming right through,and there¬ís some mild spicy malts, with orange peel and lemons, but this one is pretty hop forward, and not about complete balance. Very creamy and way too easy to drink considering the ABV. Smooth as silk and I was left wanting hops for dinner. Thanks Kev.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"
2699,"2007-01-06",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2012 I was elated to find out that good, well respected beer can come in a can.  It always seemed unfair that the jacket of a beer should determine what¬ís inside, and I saw no reason, scientific or otherwise why a hard aluminum coating would discount the quality of the drink.  That, and I rather like the aluminum can.  It rolls for cheap entertainment, is more portable, has a lower center of gravity and doesn¬ít break into a million pieces when carelessly dropped.  And so my first experience with a good beer housed in a shining cylinder I chose (or rather, was given) a can of Gordon from Oskar Blues.  As Kepano mentioned to me at the time, it is extremely tempting to slurp it out of the can, but the benefactor who bequeathed it to me expressly warned against it.  Strange as it was, I poured it into a tulip glass anyway.  The head puffs and yawns to fill the whole thing, and I barely managed to keep it within the glass confines of its new abode.  I left for a bit and when I returned the head had settled into a maritime image, for lo, there was what appeared to be a pink chunk of coral floating in my drink.  It had pock marks both small and large that connected to each other in subterranean tunnels amidst a craggy terrain of ups and downs that reminded me of my few pieces of coral taken from beaches as souvenirs.  Beneath that strange ocean phenomenon is the Gordon itself, very similar to the description that adorns the lip of the can ¬ìRed.¬î  Succinct, but fair enough.  Granted, it is an Imperial IPA, so the aroma consists mostly of hops.  It¬ís a kind of hops that kindles interest, though, not caution.  There¬ís also the slightest shot of grapefruit to prod the palate with a little sweetness.  There¬ís also a third face to the beer here, and the one I find most interesting.  See, in Colorado we¬íre very proud of our mountains even though half our state is as flat as Rachel Ray¬ís sense of humor.  We¬íre even proud of the fact that we hollowed out a ton of them and filled the streams with chemical refuse.  We offer tours of these defunct tunnels into the earth, and the abundant minerals and soil combined with ample water has a very pleasing but peculiar smell to it, and I sort of catch it in the Gordon.  The taste has it too, though it¬ís more similar to mineral water than water dripping from stalactites.  The whole mouth profile opens with this metallic, mineral wave and then buckles down with an attenuated grapefruit note.  That flavor zigzags across the tongue on a downhill course towards the throat, where it crashes with another light mineral flavor before slipping down the throat.  After a few sips that all tell the same terrestrial story I begin to notice a tiny hint of porter qualities.  This may have been the malts coming out with a little thermal energy.  I immediately associated it with some chocolate and wine characters, which fit in rather nicely with the pre-dominant metallic substance that is the flavor standard-bearer for Gordon.  It¬ís slightly bitterer than I like, but just by a hair, and that astringency keeps reminding you that, even from a can you¬íre drinking a good beer that won¬ít let itself be ignored.

Updated notes from July 12th, 2011 - Thin head, hazy orange red. Light floral hops, with some mellow sweet pine aromas, a slight touch of graham. Medium, slightly heavy body, with some bitterness, but not too much. On the sweeter side, featuring pine, but also a more complex almost marmalade type sweetness with a long aftertaste that has a touch of pine, but more of a cognac, honey sweetness.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

2699,"2006-12-14",3.5,"Can. Translucent and fiery copper in color with a frothy, grayish tan head. Aroma emits a mean green hop machine, cleaved with sugar-crusted grapefruit rind. A touch of freesia flirts with brown sugar-basted apricots for an altogether bright, strawberry cotton, visceral, aromatic jolt. Caramel cubes slowly dissipate into a honey maple graham background flavor. Centennial sentiments treat with honeyed marigold sap. Nonconfrontational and extremely balanced, eliciting feelings of English toffee brittle and amaretto cheesecake under the tamed bitterness. Weaving praline dough confronts earl grey tea for a substantive base, but the alpha acids never take a curtain call. At the tip of the tongue, it¬ís is a touch more assertive, but elsewhere, it¬ís moderately hopped caramel sauce. Cherry cotton and a tamed, sweet bitterness ride alongside the consistent caramel cube all the way to the door.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
2699,"2006-12-14",3.2,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2012 Rerate: This is basically a barleywine.

The aroma of pine, grapefruit, citric zest, etc. , nearly drown out the sweet caramel at the base of the drink - -  and that¬ís just fine for this avowed hop-head.  There are some annoying caramel malt flavors as one begins drinking, but the hops rush forward, tipping the scale in favor of some serious PNW bitterness.

2699,"2006-10-03",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 4, 2007 Pours Deep amber with clarity and noticable effervescence; head is mostly full, off-white, pillowy, and lasts well with some lacing.  Nose is nice, certainly grapefruit citrus up front with piney hops and orange peel there too, and a faint malty-caramelly note.  Flavor is somewhat simple (for an imperial) but the flavors really ¬ícooperate¬í nicely.  Piney hops prickle the tongue at first with citrus hops dominating later all with a freshness to them.  The malt back bone really compliments the hops and their moderately high bitterness, with mostly a caramel sweetness and some toasty biscuits and a note of apricots.  Palate is medium in body with a creamy texture and is betwen soft and lively after the initial ¬íprickle.¬í  Finish is fairly long and mostly bitter with some caramelly sweetness sticking around and the alcohol making itself known, but not really in a bad way.  This is one of the simpler imperials I¬íve had, but everything worked so well together and it was incredibly drinkable.  Coming from someone who is not a hop-head, this was incredibly refreshing.  Oskar blues has shown me nothing but excellent beer.

After aging one year...  Less aggressive but with plenty of hop character still.  The apricot note is more apparent, the pine notes are more resinous, and the hop character is less ""fresh"" but still attractive.

Plentiful carbonation surges upwards, creating a foamy/rocky, white head that is well-retained, and creates minor lacing.Very dry, floral nose is lightly perfumed, quite bitter but not aggressively piney or resinous.  Moreso a dry white grapefruit and lemon/orange rind, with dry, leafy green hop bud notes and a touch of yeasty, dry/dusty and b-vitaminish notes.  Light peachiness and even a touch of melon emerges upon warming, as does a thick, but not bullish honey maltiness.  Very pale in its malt bill, with only light suggestions of caramel and dry at that.  Aroma strength is medium to medium-high, mostly consisting of hoppiness, but the dryness, without excessive acidity/astringent-bitterness, allows it to be a little more heavy on the hop/malt ratio without seeming too unbalanced.Dryness in the flavor is well carried over from the nose, showing a moderately grainy, pale malted texture that seems to have a fair amount of dextrins without mounds of sweetness/sugariness.  Hop bitterness is medium-high to high, and though pushing the limits of my palate, I could see it described as only moderate to some.  Grapefruit, heavy floral notes, lemons, tangerines, peaches and oranges all combine to keep things heavily dry to the last drop.  Moderate to high carbonation, some yeastiness (dry, bland, lighltly mineral-like, nutty), no alcohol, though a touch of light warming.

2699,"2006-07-05",3.4,"Sampled both can and draft while in CO:

12 oz. Can: Ruby red pour with a creamy head that quickly forms a ring around the tulip.  Nice balance of floral (rose petals) and citrusy (orange, grapefruit) hops in the nose.  Rubbing alcohol as well unfortunately.  Big mouthfeel - softly carbed and a bit on the mushy side.  Lots of great malt profile - toffee and caramel - but everything seems to collapse on itself for some reason.  Finishes really sweet and warm with alcohol.  As the previous poster noted - not as crisp as I had hoped.  Although soggy and clunky, it is still enjoyable.

Tap at Hop Devil Grill.  Copper-coloured beer, thin off-white head.  Aroma is hoppy, earthy and fruity at the same time.  A bit of chemically flavour that I definitely don¬ít care for.  Flavour is well-balanced, lightly resiny hops over a sweet caramel malt backbone.  Toasty malts with some fresh grassy/green hops in back.  OK, but a bit of a strange beast.

Substantial amount of malt in this one that still allows lots of hop character to come through. Flavor was actually a little underwhelming at the first sip but grew on me quickly once I got used to the rather harsh bitterness in the finish. Lots of grapefruit citrus and piney flavors in here.

2699,"2006-06-02",5.0,"UPDATED: JUL 19, 2007 Corked bottle, 2004 Vintage. Pours a dark, hazey brown color with full creamy froth that slowly subsides to shallow puddle of heavy cream. Aroma is malty w/ citrus and slightly salted biscuits. Full nectar w/ soft residual effers. Flavors of lime rind are upfront w/ caramel and biscuits intertwined w/ roasted cocoa. Freakin awsome. The finish is long w/ malted herbs, citrus, leather, and a dose of asprin. Overall: This IIPA is complex with the big hops showing the full sip from start to finish. No grapefruit citrus at all, pure lime rind. It¬ís well ballanced and the alcohol is dangerously well hidden. I highly recommended this for the connoisseur. **REVISION 12-1-06** I had this brew a few nights ago and it has totally changed. The chocolate malts are really pushing forward and has become more creamy. The lime rind has turned to mellow citrus. Even the froth has turned from a shallow puddle to a tall Belgian style island that sticks like a dense, Detroit snow fall. I found out this brew is two years old now. The last time I had it was six months ago. Big changes have taken place in a short amount of time. Get this while you can. This stuff is amazing.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"

2699,"2006-02-28",3.5,"From the 12 oz. can, I poured this beer into a standard 16 oz. pint glass. The beer came out very highly carbonated with a two to three finger tall head that prevented the emptying of the entire contents in on pour. The underlying body was reddish amber in color, which was a departure from standard issue DIPAs. There was also some yeast in suspended animation in the glass. The aroma was very mild for the style with a sweet toffee-ish nose and some spicy hops. The alcohol was also evident in a mildly fumy manner. Taste was little too sweet for what it was meant to be with the mildly bitter and earthy hops providing only a slight contrast. This beer had a pleasant caramelized and balanced taste, but much closer to a concentrated English Bitter in flavor profile than a bulked up American IPA. Nice toastiness and nutty flavors also reinforced the impression that this was off style by quite a bit. The cloyingly sticky and slick mouthfeel lacked the bright punch I so love in the real Western hop monsters built on pale malt base. Alcohol was also too detectable in the aftertaste. Enjoyable but flawed, and overpriced to boot.  A decent beer, but not a good DIPA.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Terrific OB malt identity, present from the beginning to the finish, actually so much that I lose the double IPA notion, but as an American strong ale, this is highly competent, showcasing expert bitterness development that balances toasted toffee maltiness. Not intensely aromatic in its hop dosage, it is certainly highly leafy, orangey, but finishes a bit short. Rounded medium body with superb support malt and excellent medium carbonation. A brewing class.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

The nose is very nice with toasty biscuit malt and a great harmony of malt flavors gracefully balanced with the intense citrusy hops of amarillo or simcoe origin. For me, this smell conjurs up memories of brewpub travelling. That occasional beer that¬ís so fresh and intense on tap, that it just flows into your veins faster than it does your stomach. Nastalgia! The flavor is VERY balanced with a lightly dry complex malt body followed by a non-bitter but intense dry-hopping flavor that blends perfectly. Nice pine dances with the caramel malts and the grassy hop notes blend with the toasty, creamy malt aspects. The finish is a bit dry, but the sweetness is there in just the right level anyways. Low carbonation so the flavors are fresh and clean, not too acidic feeling on the palate. This is such a surprise from a can beer.

2699,"2006-02-13",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2010 Any first impressions?
-Convenient lacing is drawn by the ring of head atop the hazy reddish glow.
-Fruity maltiness rises to the nose, alongside potent leafy and citrusy C-hops.
-Berries aplenty thrive in this resinous hop grove. 
-Soft effervescence is fitting, propelling all flavors in unison.

What if you dig deeper?
-Resinous hops give plenty of bitterness to satisfy the double IPA lover.
-The rich body and fruity, hop-inclined flavor profile seem to be a distant cousin of Bigfoot.
-Not your typical Double IPA at all; a well-malted, well-hopped strong ale which screams American Craft Brew Revolution.

The mouthfeel is medium-full with a good amount of carbonation, but a little watery.  The watery mouthfeel kind of washes out the flavor.  The alcohol is very well hidden.

Overall it¬ís a fine (if somewhat mellow) DIPA.  It¬ís nicely balanced, but I would prefer a little more hops.  It¬ís similar to the Dale¬ís, but I think Dale¬ís has more bitterness and flavor.  It¬ís a tad pricy ($10 for 4), so I think Dale¬ís is the much better value.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"

2699,"2005-05-07",4.4,"Reviewed from a 2003 750ml capped and corked bottle with a hefty price tag of 14 bucks. Wow this poured out very dark with a nearly opaque dark brown with red hues and it appeared black at times. The head was a tall beige one that had good retention and left sheets of lace around the glass through the session. The nose was of a bit of fruit with citric and floral hops jumping out at you. The flavor was great with caramel and chocolate standing out more than I would expect from a double ipa and citric hops still holding there own here. A very nice mix of flavors mingling here with an interesting caramel citric bitter finish to end it all. Mouthfeel is medium to full with a nice chewiness to it. This was one of the more interesting beers I have had in a while. The malt profile added greatly to this IPA was still maintaining the hoppiness expected from it. The 9.2% really made not sharp appearances even as this warmed. If not for the huge price of this I would enjoy this one much more frequently.","Sterling, Virginia, USA","meathookjones"

Taste is very heavy on the side of the roasty, toasty malts but also offers a equally massive amount of hops to balance out this brew.

This is hoppy, but not in the massively huge resin hoppiness of some other DIPAs...the malt is much more substantial and strikes me as being more like a barley wine or strong scotch ale...this beer gains a lot of complexity from its malt, and that makes it stand out.

2699,"2004-08-03",3.0,"Sorry guys, this isn¬ít an IPA. Especially a pale ale. It¬ís an amber ale. Too dark for an IPA, no matter what you want to call it. 750 ml. green champagne bottle. No freshness date noticed. Crowned and corked bottle. Cork was about twice the length needed, because it broke my favorite corkscrew opening it. Who told you guys a 2.5"" cork was needed for sealing a bottle of beer? I¬íll digress. Poured out a deep amber, light chocolate brown color. (Hence the amber ale reference.) Not pale by ANY stretch of the imagination. It even has a dark tan colored head. C¬ímon guys, a pale ale? NOT! 
Anyway, aromas are of mostly malts, with a Zeus or Warrior hops aroma backing up the malts.
""I¬ím not a sane businessman,"" Dale says. (From their website.)
Well pal, you¬íre not a sane brewer either. You have a lot of balls charging $14 for ONE bottle of this crap.
Tastes are of malts first, followed closely by the hops. Tastes are of green hops, right off the vine. They could use a little more drying out before using them in brewing, by the way. Too green and grassy for me. I bought this beer mostly on a lark, just to try it out once, so I could say I did. I¬ím sorry I did at this point. Although this beer has a lot of flaws, and could use some serious professional help it brewing it, it¬ís ok enough to try...ONCE.
I for one, won¬ít be buying it again, unless they drop the price by 1/2 at least.","","Cobra"

Still very bright. Semi-fuzzy carbonation. Medium-bodied. Tight piney hop flavors infused with succulent bready malts. Rounded coconut notes elegantly smoothen the piney bitterness amid ensuing hints of chocolate and toasted malts. Seductively soft and slick malt body. Muted alcohol presence throughout. Pine takes the backseat to the soft citrus midway through the swallow. Hops are continually juicy and bright and everlastingly chewy toward the end of the swallow. Sweet pine resin returns to negate the dryness. Slight airiness cuts the tangy leather and raisiny sweetness in the finish and releases hop leaves. Subtle roastiness precedes the piney hop belches.

Very fruity from the hop derived citrus notes.  A sharp bitter finish but not overly so.  This beer has quite a bit of malt character, which helps to balance the intense hoppiness.

Quite tasty actually.  There is a medium-bodied fullness, which compliments both the hop and malt contributions.
