1189,"2016-11-22",4.3,"On tap at the Blackback, Waterbury VT.
This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a muddled hazy burnt orange color with a thin fingers white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Streamy to stringy lacing rode around the glass appropriately.
The aroma bleeds with a super bittersweet orange juicy pulpiness. Bittersweet grassy hoppy tones invade but extend a certain balance to the evasive malt backbone. Yes, that malt backbone is there, but exceptionally light.
The flavor leads into the balance of the orangey bittersweet juicy hops to the malts. Practically, an absolute perfect blend. Juicy orangey aftertaste charging finely into the finish.
On the palate, this one leans towards a medium bodied somewhat sessionably crisp yet bitter gripping harshness penetrating the IBUs seemingly appropriate, still with a nice balance for the most part.

Very juicy and with only a touch of resin. Theres a touch of sourdough-like character that Im not sure belongs to the hops or a specialty malt, but it intrudes a little bit in to the overall enjoyment of the nose, but is fairly passing as the beer warms and breathes. Really takes on quite the dank and melon-filled character over time, leaving light biscuit and honey behind it and no alcohol or flaw.Fantastically soft, malty, tightly carbonated mouthfeel easily balances the moderate bitterness and pinch of pine/white grapefruit. Lots of pleasant, milder tangerin/orange/mango notes add loads of juiciness and theres a good shot of acidity on the end to give balance and clear the palate somewhat.

Light golden orange. Cloudy with a small head. Maybe due to the growler?

Smell is pine and then oodles of grapefruit. One-note Columbus hops. Grapefruit overload.

Taste is sweet and citrusy hops nearly giving it the tartness of a fresh grapefruit. I expect it to turn tart as if I was eating a grapefruit, but it turns very bitter, like the pith.

Very bitter flavor, medium-low carbonation. Lots of bitter hops make it tougher to drink that most IPAs.

The flavor offers a ridiculously smooth blanket of hops. Utterly chuggable. Not too sweet, with a ton of citrus. A touch of malt in the finish, but most definitely a showcase for the hops. This is exactly what I look for in a DIPA.

1189,"2012-08-13",4.4,"In short: A highly aromatic sharp citrusy blonde IPA.  Another home-run in the Double IPA HF lineup.
How: Fresh growler consumed the day of purchase from the brewery
The look: Cloudy dark blond body topped by a medium white head with good retention
In long: Nose is an explosion of fruity (mostly citrusy) hops with grassy undertones.  In mouth I immediately recognize the signature HF IIPA malt backbone which to me is like a fresh baguette and crisp crackers with just enough sugars to oppose the hops in a loosing but valiant effort.  Also typical of HF IIPA is the super mouthfeel with many very soft bubbles, a beer you enjoy to keep in your mouth.  Hopping is intense and very bright, very grapefruity with also other citrus fruits and grass.  Bitterness level is pretty high, very bright and just sharp enough to make it refreshing without being too aggressive.  Another Hill Farmstead Double IPA that I drank like a 5% session IPA.  Great stuff as usual.  Sometimes after I visit Hill Farmstead I like to close my eyes and imagine how great it would be if this brewery was locally available to me, and Im all like Wow, that would be so awesome and my wife is all like Watch the road!

Going down this is medium-bodied, getting a little doughy malt flavor underneath a blast of tropical fruity hops.  A bit herbal.  The finish has a lengthy dry and bitter finish with notes of pine.

1189,"2012-05-03",4.0,"Big thanks to Kan for sharing.  Excited to try another Hill Farmstead.  As this was my second Hill Farmstead, my impression overall of both of them was that they are very focused beers.  They seem to highlight the hops and thats about it, which is not a bad thing at all.  Extremely clean and both beers finished very dry.  I could really start to crave this straight forward bold style.  In the taste and aroma there is plenty of tropical fruit, piney resinous hops, pineapple and lemon.  Huge flavor but not too thick or too sweet.  Really just a well made beer.","Holt, Michigan, USA","masonjer"

1189,"2012-04-27",4.4,"750mL Bottle. Thanks for sharing, Emeline. Why, Shaun, why? Why do you beers have to be so damn good. Why cant they just be good, or great, or fine. Why fan-mother-fucking-world-class fantastic? This is hard to finger, but the best way to put it is emergent. Theres layer between this and all other Double IPAs. Theres something undefinable, unattainable, and unknowable that separate the qualities of this. Yeah, it smells like its got 3,000 pounds of fresh Simcoe in the aroma. Yeah, its super fresh, super potent, super clean, and super concentrated hop flavor. But, its also....something else. Something above and beyond. Something balance and something special. Its just a hoppy beer like none Ive ever had before and the line that makes it that is undefinable.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

A - Poured beautifully. Half a finger cream colored  head with some decent head lacing. The bubbles stuck around for a while. The beer is a beautiful orange gold color SRM of 3 with lots of clouds / haze in the glass. Really spectacular looking.

S - Shaun was right. Totally an Imperial Harlan by scent. Really nice hop profile that fills the nostrils. Ruby red grapefruit, nectarine and other great citrus scents. Hints of lemon as well with a wee bit of honey. Just the right amount of hoppiness.

T - Heavenly. Very few beers taste like they smell. Very rich grapefruit juice, tangerines and some melon. Great hop finish that covers the tongue and stays around for a while.

M - 95% carbonation on the mouth swish, medium body and very dry finish. Carbonation is almost champagne-like.

O - Society 2 was my favorite black IPA. Society 3 may be my favorite Double IPA. Another fantastic tasting beer from Shaun Hill. The only thing wrong with it is the lack of it being on tap at my house to drink every night.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

1189,"2012-04-11",4.3,"My Bottom Line:
Citrusy hop resins flourish within and atop this Imperial IPAs cushiony mouthfeel, as lengthy bitterness and a lightly sand-y nature add even more personality.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A fluffy head of foam decorates the cloudy beige-y golden.
-Hop flavor is multifaceted and beautifully bright.
-The focus on this one is more on the citrus than, say, a Heady Topper.
-The comfy, fluffy carbonation and lean residual sugars carve a perfect mouthfeel.
-Drinkability is through the roof for such a big brew.
