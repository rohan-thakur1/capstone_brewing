2934,"2016-11-26",4.0,"Pours a very clear golden with lots of fine bubbles. Nose is of farm ground. Not quite poopy but very close. A very interesting exploration of the farmhouse ciders of yesteryears. Taste is very lightly tart and ultra dry. Some apples. Tons of tannins. Body is light to medium, carbonation moderate. The dryness and tannins combined makes your mouthfeel really dry and ready for another sip. Id be curious to try one of these with more acidity on it. Really interesting!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
2934,"2016-06-01",3.8,"Bottle. Thanks to Tommy for this! Clear gold with lively white head. Extra funky aroma, with hints of cow dung, hay, and apple. Taste is funky undertones, light Apple, and mild tartness. Funky, dry finish. Really crushable stuff, well done!","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","kbudd19"
2934,"2016-05-25",3.8,"Bottle - Vintage 2013 - Funky farmhouse, vinegar with a touch of Apple. Clearish gold with nice fine bubbles. Lots of funk, cooked Apple and a light finish. Nice.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2934,"2016-03-12",4.0,"Un cidre campagnard jaune paille qui laisse monter des arômes de pommes touchées par un air détable, de ferme, de pied dathlète, de moulée, de fleurs blanches poussiéreuses, de rencontre estivale, de déhanchement, de chemise nouée à la taille et de coquille duf. Un goût de pommes légèrement recouvertes de cuir, doreilles légèrement salées, de terre sous les ongles dune dame sauvage. Une sensation en bouche qui mintéresse malgré cette texture plutôt aqueuse. Une finale sèche comme un heoga qui embrasse les longs cheveux des femmes en fleurs du pays Basque.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
2934,"2016-02-18",4.0,"pours unclear bright golden with a nice bubbly white head, reviving. barn-plenty, sweaty hay, crushable rustic cereals, delicate pear and apple flavors, hint of sweetness - spicy honey and candied ginger; hint of tartness as well - malic, citric, lactic acid et al.; spicy wood along with soft tannins; cheese, lots of minerals - salt and calcium for instance. bright carbonation, light body, semi-dry bretty-peppery-spicy finish. very good farmhouse cider.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
2934,"2016-02-12",4.1,"Bottle. Clear gold pour with white head that immediately fizzes out. Aroma is intensely funky, so much barnyard, wet hay, cow plop, light cidery aroma. Taste is much the same, very funky yet not acidic at all. Palate is light bodied with full on carbonation, bone dry. Tasty cider.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
2934,"2016-01-24",4.2,"Bottle (750 ml) at home. 2013 bottle. Split 4-ways. Slightly hazy deep bright golden leaving a nice little ring of white foam. Aroma is bright, funky and farmy with oak, musty notes, apples and herbal notes. Taste is a bit less expressive than the nose but still bright and farmy with nice funk and farmhouse character, oak, musty notes, dust, apples and herbal notes. Light to medium body, but leaning toward the ligther side. Moderate carbonation. Tannic, but less than Basa Jaun. Dry. So easy drinking and quenching. I loved the farmy character. Lambic-like in many aspects. Amazing product!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
2934,"2016-01-02",4.0,"Pours dull golden with a head that leaves quick and is mostly translucent. The aroma has musty apples, wild yeast, farmhouse-like and like peels are included. It has a medium body that starts with lots of carbonation on the start and then dies off and is very dry and leaves a powdery feel in the mouth. The taste starts with dry apples, sulfur, perks, hint of air sweetness, and an earthy quality that reminds me of a saison. The finish is bone dry and has dried herbs heavy. Excellent cider in every way.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
2934,"2015-11-08",4.1,"750 mL bottle poured, properly I might add. Had to take lessons, but I figured it out. Thanks to Chris for sharing. Pours an apple juice gold with a big bubble head. Smokey aroma and flavor, which was fantastic. Apple and white grape to compliment. What a unique, delicious addition to the cider lineup. Awesome.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
2934,"2015-10-24",4.0,"Bottle at Colony Clubs ANXO event. Clear golden yellow color, edge bubbles. Aroma of blue cheese, tannins, sweaty feet. Taste is very dusty and very very dry with tart tannins. Delicious.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
2934,"2015-10-23",3.5,"Bottle pour at Colony Club during the Anxo pop-up event. Shared by Travlr, thanks Gene! 2013 vintage. Hazy yellow. Aromas of funk and hay. Tastes of apples, funk, white wine. Light body with a dry finish.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","GenDV138"
2934,"2014-08-25",2.5,"Bottle. Head is initially small, fizzy, white, fully diminishing. Body is dark yellow. Aroma is notes of apple juice, band aid / plastic, caramel, cheese. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter, slightly unclean. Medium body, watery texture, fizzy carbonation, moderately astringent.

Pretty dirty...lots of plastic phenols make it kinda hard to enjoy the nose. Aftertaste also suffers. Fizzy and astringent too. All in all, a disappointment, since I usually enjoy French ciders.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2934,"2014-06-29",3.8,"Pour from a 2012 bottle at Perennial. Pours a semi-cloudy gold with a small eggshell white head. Aroma of apples, musty funk, florals (wildflowers, really), and faint herbs. The flavor is the same, with a more pronounced apple character. Some oak, too. Medium-bodied, with a dry mouthfeel and low carbonation. Really good.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
2934,"2014-06-24",2.8,"Pale amber body, no head and little visible effervescence. Musty apples, lightly malic and oak-y. Tart, semi-sweet, a bit sour and mealy with simplicity of grape juice. Watery body with low carbonation and faint plastic off-notes","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

2934,"2014-06-09",3.4,"Bottle might have been from Chamber Street Wines, picked it up last year when I started hunting some of the less obvious stuff down. 6% ABV on the label.
Chalice. Sweaty bottle. No salty snacks in sight. Watch out for that cork.
Pours out a spritzy, ever so slight murky mellow gold. Decent white wash head. 
Unusual combination that smells of pears & ink. The usual rubber notes are faint. Grape must. Yeasty crackers. Cream soda. Apple sauce.
Taste is rich & sweet upfront, while being very green/medicinal all the way through. Moderate acid, bit of a pucker, incredibly leafy. Leather.
Texture is full of sawdust & Asprin. Soda-like carbonation. Bit of dry mouth.
Seems a bit more pedestrian then Basa Jaun. Easier, way sweeter, less acidity, less funk, less harsh in general. Nothing special.","FT: Stale Polotmavý in Queens, New York, USA","MicroGrog"
2934,"2014-04-19",4.9,"Light musty apple aroma and cold gold color. A light fruity apple flavor with a touch of fizz. Lovely light cider.","Illinois, USA","jayzz"
2934,"2014-04-11",3.8,"750ml split with GT2. SImilar darker golden color to the Basa Jaun, quick fizz. Nose is fairly muted, some peach, more apple-juicy and simple. Taste is lightly acidic, no funk, bright apple juice and peach. Clean and refreshing, but nothing like the Basa Jaun.","Oceanside, California, USA","biggirlpanties"
2934,"2014-04-10",3.6,"> A bright, more apple-juicy cider with mild acid and major tannic skin and barrel character
[ Bottle ][ Beer Study Chapel Hill NC ][ 75cl ][ $16 ][ Lost Abbey Teku ][ 4/10/14 ]
>> After a stubborn champagne cork, the bottle pops with heavy carbonation. Bubbling, high carbonation pour yields a chill hazed deep orange gold like the Basa Jaun though slightly lighter color. Nose doesnt hold a candle to the Basa Jaun. It is simpler, mild peach, flash of peach vinegar, sweet sauerkraut, something meaty like honey ham. Taste is simple- clean apple juice, very tannic barrel, lots of dusty/woody character. Palate is lightly acidic, slightly too woody/skin tannic for me. Overall, when drinking this I am thinking ""cider"" the whole time. Seems silly but with the best ciders Ive had, Im never thinking that. Rather, my head spins with a thousand flavors and cider or apple juice is never one of them. In this vein, it reminds me more of an English or American cider, which in of themselves are a step below Basque, Norman, and Breton ciders.
>!< Very simple, big woody tannic and skin balance","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
2934,"2014-03-15",3.6,"Bottle at home with scallops, swordfish, and asparagus. Pours very effervescent, lightly hazy gold with a large, fizzy, rapidly diminishing white head. Aroma is heavy medicinal and band aid phenols, earthy apples and light biscuit. Flavor is heavy phenols, sweet and tart apples with a dry finish. Light body and moderate to high carbonation.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
2934,"2013-06-21",3.2,"Bottle. Pours a hazy deep orangish gold with a thin white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma is extremely funky with a roasted apple note and a decent amount of horse blanket. Flavor has a combination of horse blanket, earthy apples and a bit of roasted apples.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
2934,"2013-02-26",3.5,"Brett-heavy basque cider. Bright clarity, golden color. Crisp and effervescent, rapid carbonation visible. Tangy yeast, tart acidity from the apples. Sterile gauze in the aroma, wet musty hay, completely dry and attenuated. Flavors of washed rind cheese, apples with moderate acidity, its pretty dry overall with a dominating dry Brett aftertaste that lingers, wet hay farmhouse notes, cheesy. Recommended to Lambic & Wild Ale fans.","RIP Johnnies, Chicago, Illinois, USA","emerge077"
