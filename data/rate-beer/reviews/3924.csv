3924,"2015-05-01",4.1,"Bottle (750 ml). From Thomas, thanks! Split 5-ways.

Appearance: Slightly hazy bright pale yellow with a small white head and little lacing. 

Aroma: Bright citrusy/lemony aroma with lactic notes, a nice farmhouse character, interesting juicy hops and nice oak presence.

Taste: Quite lemony and lactic as well with nice juiciness (pineapples, lemon), light but effective grains backbone, some farmhouse characted and well integrated oak. Mild spiciness.

Palate: Very light body, but not watery. Moderate carbonation. Rather dry and quite lemony finish. 

Overall: Finally, another good De Garde. After so many letdown, its nice to get a nice surprise. Similar profile to Hill Farmstead/Mikkeller Wheat is the New Hops. Bright aroma, super easy drinking and quenching and so tasty that you could never tell this is only 2.3 % abv.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

3924,"2015-03-15",3.3,"Another 22shared at a tasting. I think I just dislike de Gardes hoppy stuff. The lactic and hop characters come off as pissy, cheesy, and soapy. Otherwise, the base berliner is stellar as usual.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

3924,"2015-03-08",3.9,"HMOG 2015. Big ups for ericteusink popping my de garde cherry. In a day where 10% was the norm this maybe the lowest alcohol beer Iver ever had (barring NAs). Tart citrus, grassy and citrus hops. Lively carbonation and a palate cutter when it was needed in the worst way. Love it for what it is and love the low alcohol. Now would I spend $10 a pop on these to drink all day? NO. But, certainly a fun thing to mix in.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"
