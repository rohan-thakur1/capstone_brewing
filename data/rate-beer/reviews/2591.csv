2591,"2014-09-27",3.5,"""I thought I knew what to expect, having had the ""subtle"" cedar in the Humidor IPA previously. Subtle meaning the dominating characteristic. Not that I minded. That beer was awesome. This one is an odd duck, which is both good and bad. It started out odd, and grew on me. Aroma of cedar, with a sweet fruity twang to it that I did not expect. The flavor is a little tart as well, which both clashes with and alternately compliments the cedar. This was ""a little wild"" right out of the gate, and that was last year when it was brewed. Wish I could have got a fresher batch, but either way, its unique and worth trying.""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

2591,"2013-08-28",3.9,"Medium sweet malt flavors kick things off and are joined quickly by grassy and slightly medicinal flavors. Midway through the sip the flavors dry out a bit and somewhat tart green apple and pear flavors join into things.

Aroma: Honey, Late Harvest Riesling, virgin strawberry daiquiri mixed
with a virgin margarita. Appearance: Cloudy orange color; minimal

Chianti-Riesling blend; sour twang (like fresh blackberry) in the

2591,"2010-12-22",3.3,"750mL at DC Elite. First of all, I am going to kill Ryan for changing the Cigar City trademark toasted Spanish cedar notes from smelling amazing to smelling like straight up V-8 juice at times. Actually, it is pretty uncanny how this beer smells exactly like V-8 juice. There, doesnt that ruin your day?The pour is a hazy orange to reddish amber with a thinning, white head. Aroma is beautiful cedar humidor, tropical fruits, sweet orange creamsickle, honey, orange blossom. However, after the reckoning; this does smell like V-8 juice. Godammit Ryan.

2591,"2010-12-02",3.8,"Appearance: orange with an off-white head and solid haze. Slow steady stream of carbonation while her receding head leaves a heavy network of lace along the way.

Nose: wow. Intriguing. Spices, dark earth, herbs, mossy, swampy. Wood meets anise meets sweet cedar meets wet leather and barnyard funk. Tree leaves and tree back, earthy and dusty. Star fruit, papaya skin, and guava skin. Thyme is the prominent herb while juniper dapples here and there. Less smoke with far more cedar freshly cut and aromatic.

Palate: full, chewy, and of the earth. Has an essence of old earth and a different time then our modern days. Herbs, moss, wet leather, over-ripe plantains. A short finish, her flavors are wholly centered in the middle though my breath does linger with thyme and juniper. Pungent all around. Star fruit and guava skins. Barnyard funk and wet leather, saddle bags come to mind, find old dank corners covered in moss and wet earth. Cedar is a gentle permeation throughout each flavor; never dominant but never overpowered.

Final Thoughts: for a beer which really didnt contain that many added herbs and such to honor her beer history origins of gruit, she was nonetheless replete in what I can only imagine a gruit back in old England smelling and tasting of. Very much a product of mother nature, if my eyes had been closed I would have easily been standing in the middle of a damp wet rainforest or the green rolling fields of England or Scotland. Fantastic.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"
2591,"2010-12-01",3.5,"Pours a bright orange with minimal white head...almost non-existent. Not much lace results. Aroma is very sweet tropical fruits along with a strong cedar presence. As the beer warms, miscellaneous, unascertained ""gruit herbs"" make their way into the picture. Very well balanced. The taste is a little bit more off, as the herbs and cedar take over too much and it ends up tasting a bit like a holiday beer. Mouthfeel is of a medium body with low carbonation. Good drinkability. Unique, but not one of my favorites from CCB. Either way, it shows what cedar can really do, as this was one of the better--if not more interesting--gruits that Ive come across.

Taste: Bready maltiness with a slight cookie-ish sweetness is cut by a surge of lemon juice and pinch of Fleur de Sel. Addling tastes of rubbed sage, pickled ginger, and medium-grade miso. A few palate jabbing phenols scrap the tongue. Flourish of spicy cedar character akin to finely-ground white pepper. Modest tartness and funkiness. A bit more spiciness and cedar for the drying finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Fairly low carbonation.

Drinkability: Yes, it is a gruit, alright, and a fitting one at that. Theyre definitely not for everybody. Even I only care for one on an odd occasion to mix things up, though I usually end up being thankful to not be living or drinking in medieval times. This one might pair well with something featuring a hearty, herbaceous tomato sauce.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Smells like nothing Ive ever smelled before -- Im guessing thats the cedar. It almost had some fish/cheese qualities, but it kept coming back to a mosaic of fruity/sweet flavors. Weird. Theres white grape, pepper, lemon rind, honey, and overripe melon in there. The taste is  a little more straightforward, with orange rind, overripe tropical fruit, honey, and a tart finish that has lots of lemon rind.

2591,"2010-06-13",3.6,"Source:750 mL bottle that was ponied up by Rustyham at a semi-impromptu tasting.  I dont rate much anymore, but I told him I would rate this.
Glass:Tripel Karmeliet tulip. 
Appearance:Slightly cloudy orange pour with a half finger of soapy white head.  Quickly dissipates into a scum on the surface, with very little lacing.  
Aroma:The nose is totally dominated by cedar.  This probably had some subtle spicy notes of sage and pepper that were COMPLETELY swallowed up by the dry spiciness of the cedar.  Dont get me wrong, I love smelling a good cigar box, but when it gets in the way of the natural tendencies of the beer, it becomes a draw-back. 
Flavor:The flavor TOTALLY blossomed on this.  Up front there is some spice, probably black pepper.  Through the middle, a distinct sweetness, almost a fruity sweetness like oranges.  The finish contains the cedar, but in an almost muted amount, and it doesnt linger as to destroy the flavor of subsequent sips. 
Palate:Medium/light bodied.  I think that the cedar notes actually make the Humidor series beers taste fuller bodied than they actually are.  Not a bad thing/not a good thing, just a thing.  Solid carbonation keeps the tongue continually refreshed.  
Overall:As much as I hate the Homer-ism from some of the Florida crew, this beer was definitely something new for me, and was very drinkable.  I wish that the cedar aging didnt totally dominate the nose, but you have to work with what youve got.  Big thanks to Rustyham for sharing this.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","nqualls"

Pours a opaque unfiltered cider like color with a surprisingly big head that quickly dissappears. 
The aroma is all cedar. Too much in my opinion. Not unlike the cedar aroma you get from the Jai Alai Humidor Series beer (minus the hops of course). Slight herb aroma as well.
The taste is hard describe as this beer is like no other I have ever really had before. The cedar is present but not as hard core as in the nose. Lager like taste. Woody from the cedar. Strange herb flavor as well. Slight bitterness at the end.
Mouthfeel is light/medium.

The aroma is heavy on the peppery and oliy cedar wood with notes of vegetal spices and cereal grain and bready malts. After the cedar the aroma is very different and funky. The flavor follows with a punch from the peppery, cedar wood and cedar oil, but it balances nicely with the clean, cereal and bready malts. There is some nice spices mixed in as well. The cedar wood really acts well with the void of hops. Medium bodied with balanced carbonation and a slick mouthfeel that lends well to sessioning.

2591,"2010-05-05",3.5,"Draft at Redlight Redlight.  Pours a clear, medium golden color with a small, smooth head of off-white foam.  Gaunt, droopy lines of lacing grip the glass softly.  The aroma booms with oily, peppery cedar, the intensity of which slowly subsides as notes of honey kissed cereal (think Golden Grahams) and doughy wheat emerge.  Like the nose, the flavor is simplistic, yet harmonic, as the strikingly peppery, woody, cedar oil element acquiesces to the bready, honey-cereal maltiness.  The cedar does a nice job of mimicking hops in that regard.  On the palate, this unique brew sports a medium body and a creamy, somewhat slick mouthfeel that is suitable for sessioning (if you can take the cedar intensity).  I could drink several pints of this back to back.  Nice, interesting brew.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
2591,"2010-05-01",3.7,"Thanks to Kevin for the growler!  Poured murky medium peach with a fine cap of off-white head.. set up nicely in the glass.  The aroma picked up black pepper and cedar above all else.. some mint and juniper beneath, joined by sour vinegary notes and whiter vinous character.. very odd, but intriguing.  The flavor found drier honey and apricots at the core with tart cedar and black pepper laced throughout.. minty notes and lemon pepper around.. finished with dry black pepper and sour barrel character.  Light-medium bodied with lovely interplay between the spicy cedar and the peppery base beer.. lots of pepper and fine sourness that lingered on the refreshing finish.. very interesting and enjoyable stuff!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
2591,"2010-05-01",3.1,"Nice light orange hue with a very nice bubbly head and that pleasant bubbling noise.  Smells and tastes like spicy Spanish cedar with some light sweet flavors, maybe dried mango or apricots?  Not exactly bad, and I like experiments, but I wish this was a bit less like drinking a cedar plank and had more diverse flavors.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
2591,"2010-04-29",3.5,"Bottle in the parking lot at Dark Lord Day courtesy of gunhaver I believe.  Pours a hazy gold with a medium sized white head.  Cedar, and fresh summer corn on the cob with butter and salt and pepper, and it works pretty well.  Sweet, corn and coriander on a medium body with a light citrus presence.  Pretty yummy.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
2591,"2010-04-29",3.9,"This is nice. Smells like a humidor with that rich cedary cigar box wood nose and flavor. Theres also a light funk and spiciness. Flavor is more funky than the nose, its lightly tart, slightly cheesy. Finish is cheesy, salty, woody. Really an adventure and definitely one of a kind. Copper color, fizzy head.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
2591,"2010-04-27",3.9,"Draft Cloudy orange ale with a small, creamy, white head that dissipates faster than you can say quick. The nose is meaty, lightly acidic and very peppery tons of humidor cedar. Full-bodied with medium carbonation. I cant believe there are no hops in here ok, I believe it, but I am astounded that this brew is not cloyingly sweet. Sure, it leans on the sweet side of balance, but just barely. The humidor cedar works pure magic here more so than with any other Humidor Series beer. The flavor is meaty, but in a good way. Theres bitterness here that I cant explain; not much, but its definitely present. Big time cedar. Woody, modestly bittersweet finish. Delicious and so original. I love trying traditional styles of beer. Thanks go out to CCB for doing something they certainly didnt have to do. A risk that paid off for me  much like Samuel Adams Traditional Ginger Honey Ale that no one, other than me, seemed to appreciate or enjoy. I could drink an awful lot of this one.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2591,"2010-04-27",3.2,"Draft at redlight redlight.  Pours an attractive bright though slightly tarnished gold.  Very cloudy.  White head with some nice lace.  The nose is intriguing with notes of cedar and leather, some subtle hints of cigar, strong notes of spice, which combine to make an almost cologne like aroma, which though aromatic is not necessarily entirely enticing.  Flavor is ok but something about the characteristics is not lining up the way it should.    Kind of tastes like something that wasnt intended for drinking, but tastes ok anyway.  Interesting beer, but not my favorite from Cigar City.  I would like to see them tweak it and try again.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Teege"
2591,"2010-04-27",3.3,"750 ml shared by gunhaver. Pours a nice hazy amber, nice offwhite head that dies to a thick film, laces ok. Aromas are cedar wood spice, pale malts, faint vanilla, light pepper. A bit vague but definitely cedar forward. Initial is  mellow, lighter side of medium bodied throwing a decent cedar wood spice, pale bready and doughy malts, vanilla, pepper and wet wood. Nice. Cedar comes into focus, although the brew is a bit vague overall. I taste cedar of course, I taste the malts... But was that all this was supposed to be? Ive got another bottle of this coming up so a re-rate is pending. I guess the goal was just to display cedar wood and what it does to a beer.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
2591,"2010-04-26",3.2,"Thanks to whoever shared this at DLD. Pours hazy yellow gold with white head. Aroma was cedar and earthy with some citrus notes. Flavors of cedar, musky grapes, some citrus, light tartness, and kind of earthy. Odd little brew. Very interesting and glad to have tried this.","Mount Prospect, Illinois, USA","msante79"
2591,"2010-04-26",3.2,"Got to try this at DLD 2010.  I want much of a fan, but I will say that this is one of the better guits that Ive tried.  It was lighter bodied than most of the sort Ive tried before.  Im still not a big fan of the herb and spice thing.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
2591,"2010-04-24",3.5,"Got to sample this thanks to a very generous member of the Florida crew at DLD2010.  Murky yellow pour with off white head.  Aroma is bready, cedar,  hard boiled eggs.  Flavor is pretty different.  Tough to describe: sweet, wood, spice, a bit of eggs.  Pretty cool to try regardless.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
2591,"2010-04-23",3.2,"Tap @ CCB.  Poured a hazy yellowish orange color with a thin egg shell head.  Earthy nose with notes cedar, juniper, honey, and a touch of bread.  Medium body with soft carbonation.  Flavor is spicy and earthy with primary notes of cedar, honey, and juniper, secondary notes of caramel, bread, and lemon.  Strange brew, dont know if I would order 2.","Tampa, Florida, USA","HOPSHUNTER"
2591,"2010-04-23",3.2,"Pours out a murky golden amber with some fizz that quickly settled. Smells sweet fruity with lots of cedar. Taste is more of the same with some spice and a mineral flavor. Thin-ish, but interesting brew. Different from anything Ive had. I would drink again.","Colorado, USA","djtimeless"
2591,"2010-04-23",3.5,"Draft at Redlight. Amber pour with a nice thin head. Huge pungent woody cedar aroma, very powerful. Woody, herbal, cedar and nice sweet malt taste. Not something I could drink a whole lot of, but unique and tasty.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
2591,"2010-04-19",1.6,"Let me start by saying I am a HUGE Cigar City fan.  But this was terrible.  Early aroma of hardboiled eggs and juniper.  Taste of the same.  As it warmed, more sulphur.  I could barely finish it.  Was burping up sulphur for hours.  Best comment ""Its missing something... what is it... oh yeah... brimstone...""","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","jedinord"
2591,"2010-04-17",3.5,"The aroma is a little weaker than I was expecting but I could still pick out cedar, caramel malt, and spice (juniper?). The appearance is a cloudy amber with a thin head that fades fast. The taste is very nice and very much like the aroma with a bit of funk but mostly sweet malt. The palate is smooth despite the apparent flat appearance. Overall I really liked this beer! Not exactly what I was expecting but it was very good.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
2591,"2010-04-16",3.5,"Flip top packed up from FL by ibrew, thanks Dave.  Light hazed dark honey golden with tight creamy head.  The cedar is huge on the nose...at first it is like gym clothes sweat, then sulfiric and now it is more of a corn nut cedar...hard to wrap my head around.  Very creamy mouth feel.  Salty, cedar, this weird earthy pepper bitterness with the cedar coming through more.  Hard to really figure this one out, but I kind of like it.","Washington, USA","bvc"
2591,"2010-04-16",3.3,"So this smells like cigars, cedar, salt, sulfur. Super odd nose. Spices are there, dust and musty notes as well. Murky orange brown pour with a foam ring around the edges. Cedar, cigars, sulfur, spicy musty notes with long lingering salt/sulfur. Some vanilla notes, light sweetness, but still get some salty sulfur. A super strange beer, odd stuff going on here. Every nose and flavor profile experience changes ¡y attempt. Very interesting.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
2591,"2010-04-16",2.6,"growler, thanks dave! cigars, sulphur, salt, and wood shavings on the nose. a little farty too. creamy flat body. egg yolks and cedar on the mid palate. mild sulphury finish.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2591,"2010-04-12",3.6,"UPDATED: APR 14, 2010 Growler. Pours hazy golden color with a decent white head. Aromas are full of pepper, spice, and big cedar aroma, almost to the point that you are smelling a cigar box. Flavors are the same as the nose with the cedar really standing out, and get the spices on the finish. Also a tad bit sweet. Finish is all about the cedar since it lingers for a while. Not a bad beer and definitely interesting.","Florida, USA","Tsotsi"
2591,"2010-04-11",3.6,"Growler from CCB. Pours a slightly hazy amber color with one finger fizzy white head that settles quickly. Aroma is pine, cedar, ash, funk, straw, yeast, some hints of caramel and honey. Flavor is sweet and floral with notes of pine, cedar, spice, caramel, honey, light floral esters, spice. Medium body and citrusy pine finish. Interesting ale.","Tampa, Florida, USA","kiefdog"
2591,"2010-04-10",3.8,"sampled on tap at the cigar city tasting room.  Hazy/murky light orange in color with a head that recedes - which not hopping it may have contributed to.  Alot of spicy and earthy cedar in the aroma mixed with bready yeast - a touch of sourdough, citrus, and some light honey malt sweetness.  Taste - is alot of earthy and spicy cedar up front.  While I thought it was a bit over the top in some of the humidor beers, I thought it worked well here. It balanced the sweet, pale malt backbone and bready, yeasty quality of this beer well.  I liked it. Finishes with lingering spicy cedar....","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
2591,"2010-04-10",3.7,"Sample at brewery.  Pours hazy yellow with a small white head.  nose is cedar, spice, some malt, and a slight citrus quality. Flavor is similar: some malt, definite cedar, spice, pepper, and a tiny bit of citrus.  I almost feel like there was one hop in the beer.  Interesting- ccb cedar ale without hops.  I think I could drink this occasionally.  It is not better or worse than the Midnight Sun Gruit, it is different, and not 12% ABV.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
2591,"2010-04-09",3.6,"Draft @ CCB. Pours a dark yellow with a fizzy white head. Nose is earthy, big spicy cedar, sweet fruit, grapes, musty basement. Flavor is sweaty, semi tart, moldy wood, spicy cedar, hints of fruit. Starts getting very odd as it warms. Definitely different.","Alaska, USA","gkost"
2591,"2010-04-09",3.0,"Thanks to Solan for the pour from a growler, though I couldnt finish it.  The aroma reminds me of a hot summers day, after mowing my lush lawn of the thickest and brightest green St. Augustine grass.  I get my fertilizer spreader out, and fill it with Scotts Turfbuilder for a quick feeding.  The lawn appreciates the feeding and will respond by looking fabulous well into the fall months.  I sit down to marvel at the turf I have built and take a deep breath through the nose.  Mmmmmm...  fresh cut grass, fertilizer and a little bug spray to keep those pesky chinch bugs away.  The flavor is lighter, a little sweet, and dry.  The cedar is forward, but if you were paying attention, youd think you were drinking that Scotts Turfbuilder.  I could see how others would like this.  It is odd and original.  It just isnt for me.","Orlando, Florida, USA","GodOfThunder"
2591,"2010-04-08",3.6,"growler shared by Solan (i think?).  Rotten wood cedar nose, somewhat musty, with a peppery spice.  Pours an amber golden with a thin white head.  Strong cedar flavor, peppery, citrus, bitter lemon peel, slightly vegetal, hints of vanilla, with a spicy malty finish.  Im not sure what I think of it, Ive definitely never had anything like it before!  I dont think I could drink it all the time but its growing on me.  Definitely one of a kind and a treat to sample.","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
