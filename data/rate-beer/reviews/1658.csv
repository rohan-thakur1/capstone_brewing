1658,"2014-06-18",3.5,"Reviewed from notes.
This was poured into a pint glass and a mug.
The appearance was a nice looking dark brown close to black color with a decent one finger white to off white foamy head that once it dissipates, theres a decent amount of white foamy lacing thats kinda light for the most part.
The smell had a nice dry roasted coffee aroma with some light chocolate trying to come through but stays in the background for the most part
The taste was mostly dry with a nice roasty sort of coffee-ness coming through.
On the palate, this one sits about a light to medium on the body and it has a fairly decent sessionable aspect about it.
Overall, I say this was a decent Irish Dry Stout worthy of having again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

1658,"2012-05-07",2.6,"Thanks to a generous Southern NH trader who sent me this. Kept it around for a week, poured into a Hill Farmstead glass at 55 Degrees F.

A - 1-Finger dark leathery head subsided to a quarter finger. Dark brown to black pour, reminds me of cheap motor oil.

S - Gigantic mal smells. Roasted and smoked malts with a bit of chocolate and german bock scent. Mild hop profile

T - Coffee and cocoa come through first, mild bit of wood but a fleeting sweetness and sour taste that hurts the beer at the back of the tongue. Starts off great, dies down fast to a bad taste.

M - 80/20 carbonation, light body

Appropriately black in color with a lasting, uneven, light tan head and plenty of thick lacing.

typcial stout appearance. a little lighter than the big boys but this is an irish dry. thin head though, was wanting a little more on top. 

smell is vanilla/oaky, some caramel and a lot of nuttiness. some roasted coffee, medium roast. i get some reminiscence of sunflower seeds. strange, but i like it.

Flavor is not as intense as the smell but still has that nice subtle roastiness, very nutty, a bit of woodiness and slight bits of chocolate. no hop character that i can find.

A rich roasted malt profile comes thru in the nose whit an ample hop presence. The flavors are more of the same, along with a slight coffee espresso note thrown in for good luck. Again the Nitro dose a lot for this brew and for sure it helps out in the way it feels in your mouth. Rich smooth and creamy are good adjectives for it.

1658,"2008-07-26",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 15, 2008 Draught (nitro) @ Portsmouth Brewpub. Pours opaque black with a moderate, creamy tan head. Nose is roasty, a bit of cocoa. Taste is round and smooth - cocoa and a bit of coffee, roasty malt, and a very light acidity to balance, very light roasty dryness on the smooth finish. Mouthfeel is creamy with a big round body. Delicious beer.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","JohnQPublic"
1658,"2008-06-24",3.4,"Dark brown.  Light head.  Fudgey, chocolatey and deep aroma - delicious.  Balanced, fudgey character.  Gets a bit thin and husky (common issue with this brewery).  I like the chocolate note, though.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1658,"2008-06-17",3.5,"Draught, sample @ brewpub. Opaque black with small white head and lacing. Rich roasted malt nose and flavors that permeate the body and linger nicely in the finish.

1658,"2008-04-05",3.8,"Pours a dark, almost burnt looking brown.  The aroma is nutty, roasted and seems to have a slight hint of smoke.  The flavor is an extension, with a bitterness that seems to round this one out nicely.","Saint Cloud, Florida, USA","CheesedMan"
1658,"2008-02-13",3.4,"Bottle from porterhouse and served in my Stone IRS snifter: Deep brown hue with a fading frothy tan head and left spotty lace in its wake. The aroma has notes of grapefruit and piney vapours, coffee, toasted and charred malt, some bittersweet chocolate too. The taste is a fine balance of sweet malt and bitter hops with a mild lactic twang. Coffee and a touch of smoke is also found within. The mouth feel is a tad thin and chalky (A problem I had with Kate the Great as well). Overall a very drinkable stout I had no problem finishing.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
1658,"2008-02-06",3.7,"Severely dark chestnut brown with a thin tan head.  Nutty hazelnut/chocolate, mild smoke on the aroma.  Smooth nutty taste, a little chocolate, lightly bitter finish.  Nice roasty smooth taste overall.  A good brew.","Florida, USA","JMFG"
1658,"2008-02-05",3.9,"Pours from the bomber to a dark black color with medium thick tan head that lingers well and leaves okay lacing. Aroma is a sweet blend of malt choclate, toffee and roasted nuts, with just a hint of hops. The only downside of this beer was the mouthfeel, which was fairly flat and watery, probably due in part to the low %abv. The taste  kicked back in with the same malty flavors found in the nose. This all rounded off to a nice pleasant finish. 
Not a bad beer at all.","Dacula, Georgia, USA","kimcgolf"

1658,"2007-11-06",3.6,"11/06/2007:  Black Cat Stout is a dark brown coffee color (looks black and opaque in the glass) with a pillowy tan head that lasts a surprisingly long time (based on the fizzy sound while pouring I figured it would just bubble away pretty quickly).  This beer really did produce a perfect pout into my English pint glass!  There is even detailed lacing left behind on the glass as the head settles down to a frothy, lasting crown.  The aroma is a bit funky with something slightly sour and smelling of sweet mold up front (hmmm, old milk?) with some chocolate nearly hidden in the middle and roasted malt in the back that I suspect crosses the line to being burnt.  Quite interesting.  Hopefully the flavor is fairs better...  The flavor is actually pretty rich and roasty with a bit of dry smoke that begins mid-palate and carries through the dry roasty and charred finish.  Some pleasing and balancing hop flavor (green/leafy and floral) and bitterness comes through in the finish and lingers on the palate.  It blends really nicely with the dry, roasty chocolate finish and after taste.  Yum!  The flavor is right on what I want in a Dry Irish-style Stout.  As far as mouthfeel goes, this beer has a a medium to medium-full body and is quite mellow and smooth.  In my opinion, thats a great palate for the style.  Overall I am quite satisfied with this beer.  Im not sure what that off smell is at first, but it seems to fade away as the beer warms and the flavor makes up for it in the end!  I highly recommend this stout for those that like the dry style and who can actually get their hands on a bottle! ... Wow, I took my time with this bottle (about an hour) and I am feeling it pretty good.  There is no way this is only 5% ABV.  Ive had this bottle since April 2007 or so, but it would have to have climbed a long way from 5% over the past 6-7 months to make me feel the way I do now!  Dang...

Very lightly bitter finish with a little weak brewed coffee.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with an oily slick texture and soft fizzy carbonation.  Overall, not the best Stout.

Aroma is heavy rich roasted coffee with some milk chocolate as well. Mouthfeel fairly smooth, pretty dry, esp. in finish. Nice heavy well-formed rings of lacing. Flavor is strongly coffee-ish - strong bitter coffee roast with some hints of dark bitter chocolate. Quite dry as I mentioned above. Some unfortunate soapy hints mean I have to knock this down a bit on flavor. Lingering bitterish coffee aftertaste. A pretty heavy duty stout.","Boothbay, Maine, USA","porterhouse"
