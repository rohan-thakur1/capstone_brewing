3893,"2016-11-10",3.9,"Draft pour on tap at the brewery (Capitola, CA). Pours a well hazed juicy pale golden hue, darker middle with frothy white ringer atop. Decent ringer laces solid. Aromas are potent and bitter, Galaxy leads the charge with some supporting tropical and grapefruit appeal, mellow cattiness, firm floral and powdery bitterness. Pithy citrus, tropical jab, firm dry bitter appeal. Initial is lighter bodied, a bit tropical and fruity with that telltale Galaxy earthy, cool, Southern Hemisphere appeal. Powdery, bitter, clean. A bit of juicy Five Alive soda appeal, mellow almost flabby carbonation but the flavors flow and kick nicely. A bit powdery, firmly bitter, this goes down nice and easy. A faint biscuity malt touch on the back but nowhere as big as the Time Sensitive base. The hop presence here doesnt slap you in the face, instead integrating very well, cleaner bitter finish, that Galaxy appeal firm and enjoyable without overwhelming. Tasty stuff. Really nice nose.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

The taste is smooth and slick with sessionable spicy earthy dank onion hoppiness going on where I just dont want to stop drinking this.

The aroma is juicy and full of excellent hop flavor. Theres pine, tangerine, grapefruit, peach, blackberry, lemon, grass. Nice dank aroma. As it warms, it gets increasingly juicy. Just a little bit of biscuity malt character. I probably wouldnt notice it without a taste, but the mineral flavor also comes through. Its a sorta chalky water note, hard to describe, but it seems to be common to the recent crop of excellent hoppy beers. The taste is juicy with the same dank hop flavor and a very pleasant mineral note. Very easy to drink. Enough sweetness to bring out the hop flavors, but the beer finishes dry. Moderately bitter. Lots of hop flavor in the taste. Smooth feel. Normal carbonation, though I guess thats to be expected as its a growler fill. Very good IPA. Extremely easy to drink. Refreshing. Lots of flavor.
