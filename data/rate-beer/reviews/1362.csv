Some metal/copper right at the end, slightly astringent. Toast, light chocolate. Taste: lightly sweet, lightly bitter finish. Overall: Enjoyable. Turns out I still dont know shit about lagers.

I want to learn.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
1362,"2015-01-27",3.7,"The beer is a medium-dark brown color. Its somewhat hazy. The head is tan foam. Some lacing, pretty good retention. The aroma is light caramel and toasty malt with a very pleasant nutty character. Mild sweet lemony, fruity note. The taste is lightly sweet with a touch of bitterness and very mild acidity. A little cocoa but much more of that toasty, nutty malt flavor. Finishes clean. Pleasant and easy to drink. Creamy and full for the strength of the beer.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

1362,"2013-02-17",3.6,"Tasted on 2/17/13 from a capped 650mL bomber bottle sent as an extra in a trade. Pours dark, nearly opaque amber with a thin tan head that slowly recedes to a decent collar of lace. The nose is malty, roasted, and nutty with lighter roasted coffee, cocoa nibs, and some nicely fresh and green hoppy aroma. The flavor is much the same with the nicely roasted notes up front with some nuttiness, moving to the more bitter notes of coffee and hops. The body is medium with average carbonation and a long nicely bitter roasted and hoppy finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
1362,"2012-12-21",2.6,"22 oz. bottle, pours a chestnut brown with an amber tinge and a small beige head. Aroma is very nutty, with some feint dried fruits. Flavour is quite nutty as well, with some subtle dark fruits, and some bready malts. Not sure why this is rated so high, as its fairly boring with a weak flavour palate. Drinkable, but generic.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1362,"2012-08-21",3.4,"650ml bottle pours brown in color with a 2 finger off-white head that leaves some nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma is nutty with hints of caramel and chocolate with some roasted and earthy notes as well.  Taste is a roasted nutty and earthy bitterness balanced nicely with a caramel and chocolate malty sweetness.  Lighter bodied than expected but with decent carbonation.  An easier drinking dunkel that is quite tasty.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"
1362,"2012-03-21",3.8,"22 oz bottle.  Clear copper brown with a pocked beige head.  Nose is dough, raisin, nuts and, deep down, blackberry pie.  Wow, this smells fantastic!  Not quite medium body but i wouldnt want it much heavier.  Soft carb with a silky finish.   Taste is subtle brown sugar, bitter almond and grass; cocoa powder and clove linger.  Each sip is a dunkel revelation.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
1362,"2012-03-19",4.9,"Translucent, rusty red-brown pour.  Thin tan head is tight-bead and creamy.  Sweet roasted hazelnut and  toasty brown bread in the nose.  Earthy, crisp, and mineral laden.  Mouthfeel is light and silky.  Soft carb enhances a smooth and highly drinkable body.  Subtle hopping shows itself as lightly bitter walnut skins that carry away the kilned grain like dried leaves on the wind.  This has all the mystery and charm of a cool autumn forest before the coming dark.","Wilderness, WA, USA, ","brewolf"
1362,"2012-03-19",4.0,"Bottle from brewolf...thanks Michael! - Man, everything I have from these guys so far has just knocked it out of the park, and this is no exception. Rosy brown pour with a thin filmy light tan head. Nose is toasted malt, a touch of milkiness, notes of burnt sugar, and just a hint of baking spice. The taste is a nice balance between toasted graham crackers and bread dough. Has a lingering medium bready roast flavor that lasts through the long finish. No hopping that I can taste, but that touch of milkiness is still there. A light body, but fluffed up with some ample carbonation. Excellent stuff--could drink in quantity.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

1362,"2011-12-24",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 28, 2016 Here we go again.  Exceptionally balanced, bright, earthy, toasty and fresh, leaning to the dry side. Mineral-rich and toasty with firm malt body and tight carbonation. Subtle and quiet, it doesnt come across as Americanized as the pils (which regardless is still amazing), rather it seems it could be right out of Bavaria, in fact for my tastes its a level above most dunkel Ive had in Germany.  Toasted grains, just-scorched crackers, bread crust, its this character throughout thats exceptionally flavorful and, more importantly, perfectly balanced.  Mild fruity esters compliment rather than detract, similar in nature to the Coastal vienna.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1362,"2011-08-28",2.9,"A reddish amber dunkel with a thin light moka head. In aroma, a nutty malt with light cinnamon notes, lightly meaty and musky.

1362,"2011-06-03",3.6,"Nicely done American dunkel.  Slightly banana, mild roast, hints of cocoa, lightly dark fruits...all blended together well.  This was a bit thinner than expected, from what else Ive had from these guys.  Lovely drink though!","Earth, Washington, USA","skoisirius"
1362,"2011-05-01",3.2,"Bottle: &nbsp Deep caramel pour, moderate to large foamy off-white head, fairly decent lacing. &nbsp Huge toasted malt nose, lots of nuttiness as well. &nbsp Big nuttiness on the tongue, dry, clean, but not a whole lot of caramel like malt. &nbsp Smells and tastes somewhat of a Brown Ale but without the Ale characteristics. &nbsp A little earthy on the backside. &nbsp Lingering toasted malts and nutiness. &nbsp Actually if I didnt know better I would I might consider this a Brown Ale. &nbsp Tiz okay, but not what I thought of as a Dunkle. &nbsp Needs more caramel malt characterm. &nbsp Also a touch thin. &nbsp Sessionable for sure.","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"

1362,"2010-07-25",3.6,"10 ounce sample on tap at The Horse Brass in Portland, OR.  Aroma is a bit fruity with berry notes before it takes on a little toasted and roasted character.  Dark amber transparent body with a light tan head and fair lacing.  Very nice, roasted, slightly burnt and chocolatey malts to start.  This is relatively full-bodied and nicely roasted.  Pretty good stuff.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
1362,"2010-01-27",3.9,"22. Pours an opaque dark ebony with a dense, creamy tan head that falls away to virtually nothing. Leaves occasionally webby strings of lace. Big roasty, chocolatey nose with some brown sugar--not impy stout big, but huge for the style, the yeast, the abv, the mash bill, and so on. Creamy medium body, nearly as big as an ale. Roasty, chocolatey, brown sugary mid-palate. Mild brown bread finish. Very tasty and satisfying.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
