3900,"2016-07-19",4.2,"From notes. Enjoyed at Dougs house for the Epic Peach and Apricot debacle of a tasting that happened on July 9. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a medium golden yellow color with a bright white head that falls down with no lace. The aroma is definitely apricot forward. Hell, the apricots just about dominate the whole thing. There is a light sourness on the nose and a little bit of a citric acid in there. The flavor is very similar. The apricots do very well. The light lemon citrus balances a good sour and there is a hint of funky wheat toward the back end. The mouth feel is crisp and light with a bright carbonation and a lingeringly dry apricot flesh with a big sourness on the aftertaste. This is pretty damn good.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
