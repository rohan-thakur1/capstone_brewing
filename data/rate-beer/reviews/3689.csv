3689,"2012-06-06",3.7,"13th February 2010Opaque black beer, no head. Aged malt nose - a little sour and with obvious barrel wood. Light crisp palate. Rich wood to the fore, very subtle and surprisingly subtle bourbon. Rich unsweet chocolate undertone. Light minerals in the finish. Nice beer but the barrelling destroys some of the complexities of the base beer. Nontheless this is a good beer in its own right.",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"

Good stuff overall. An interesting beer. I like that Kuhnhenn packages their big beers in 12-ouncers. That size is way more manageable than bombers/750s, and Im almost inclined to bump up the drinkability as a result of that.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

Very thin palate, kind of off putting for this beer though it does have a bit of a coating quality. Starts sweet, a bit like molasses or brown sugar.

3689,"2010-01-20",3.7,"12oz bottle courtesy of the ever-generous hoppymeal, poured into a snifter.

Pours a dark mahogany that looks deep copper when held up to the light.  The head is very short-lived and recedes to a small collar and leaves no lacing, just some boozy legs after each sip.

For lack of a better term, the aroma is thick...and boozy.  Its got a ton of brown sugar, plums, raisins, all soaked in bourbon.  There is a bit of sweet chocolate as well.  Definitely hot.

The taste is even hotter, I mean, wow, boozy as hell.  There is bourbon, bourbon and some more bourbon.  I think I can get some dark fruits and definitely molasses, but its hard to make out much of anything under the bourbon heat.

The mouthfeel is super sweet and heavy.  Seriously burns going down, full mouthfeel and very, very slick.

This is one big beer.  Its crazy sweet, crazy boozy and not all that drinkable.  Still, a memorable and unique effort from Kuhnhenn, though I definitely prefer the non-BA version.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

3689,"2009-11-21",3.2,"Vanilla, oak, bourbon, lots of dark fruit, including figs, plums, and some raisons.  A fairly intense aroma overall, but theres some definite alcohol presence coming through as well.  Color is very dark, though when held to light, it shows itself to be a dark reddish brown color.  No head and no lacing.  The taste immediately begins with tons of the dark fruit and some caramelized sugar flavors before leading into a rather hot finish.  There almost seems to be a decent bitter kick coming through and a little bit of oak, but just not all that pleasant tasting.  Sits pretty well on the tongue; thick, but not overly so and has a low to moderate amount of CO2.

3689,"2009-11-08",4.2,"Bottle, courtesy northernbrews. The pour yields a nearly still, lightly translucent, dark mahogany-mauve colored body. Theres virtually no head or lacing, though some sugary sheeting does show  on the glass. The nose is massively malty and complex. Initial components include burnt caramel, chewy nougat, rum raisin bread, figs, and sweet dates, all wrapped in a veil of oaky bourbon and vanilla. Further contemplation reveals hints of cinnamon and cocoa, along with a touch of roast that comes through with a saving balance. It smells absolutely fantastic, and as bold as it is, the bourbon is actually subtle when backed up by such massive amounts of malt. Flavors are of burnt honey, toasted caramel, cocoa and grain roast, along with bourbon soaked raisins, dark fruits, and hazelnuts. The saturated oak imparts more vanilla and spicy wood than boozy bourbon, though some delactable alcohol warmth shines through. The body is thick and full, showing a light, sherry-like oxidation and a warming, spicy, winter time finish. This excellent brew seems to be at its sweet spot right now, and its really a pleasing slow sipper. I sat on my front porch on a cool November night, enveloped in this complex brew and the surrounding darkness and quiet for a matter of a couple of hours.

The aroma is very complex, offering a wealth of olfactory delights  maple syrup, sorghum molasses, burnt rubber, oak and a splash of whisky. Full-bodied and a touch abrasive with soft carbonation. The flavor is red hot, alcohol-wise, and a touch rubbery, but there is an excellent, malty, carbonous and vinous vibe that Im totally digging here. Dried plum and caramel sweetness, earthy woodiness, red wine acidity and carbonous bitterness balance out very nicely. Tons of dark fruit  figs, dates, dried plums - and mocha .

The taste starts as liquid brown sugar with a heavy alcohol smack down while being backed up by earthy and leathery tones. The finish displays fruity notes and a light soy character.

3689,"2009-07-01",4.2,"Bottle:  The aroma consists of bourbon, caramel, maple syrup, vanilla, and chocolate.  In my opinion, the aroma is very reminiscent of Sam Adams Triple Bock.  It pours a dark brown with some red highlights of transparency with a minimal beige head that quickly fades to nothing.  The flavor starts with caramel and chocolate.  The finish comes on quickly with moderate maple syrup, vanilla, light fruit, and light bourbon.  Alcohol is noticeable in the finish with a nice warmth/burn and flavor.  While noticeable, I dont find it overbearing.  Medium-full bodied with a slick mouthfeel.  Overall, this really reminds me of Sam Adams Triple Bock with some light fruitiness and a less syrupy and thinner mouthfeel.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
