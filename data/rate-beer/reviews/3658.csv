It's sweet, boozy, and then strongly metallic. It's more old boozy oxidized Porter than old ale.

And color the beer itself a nearly impenetrably black, though a lift up to the lights does reveal the faintest streaks of brilliant crimson. A pretty aggressive pour begets a one-finger head with a nice, cocoa powder colored head. Sadly, however, the crown is quickly gone, leaving just a ring in its wake. Ah, scotch. Scotchy scotch scotch. The aroma is a celebration of the spirit, balanced with notes of dark chocolate as well as some sweeter fruity esters: currants, plums. A slight alcohol burn is also there, but its muted and blended nicely. Id say the scotch is even more subdued in the flavor than in the nose, but this isnt necessarily a bad thing. In fact, in interacts very well with the a heavy dark fruit sweetness. Amazing coffee notes from the malt hit at the finish and linger in the back of the throat for a while after the swallow. The mouthfeel seems to be the only downside to this beer. You would expect a brew whose name translates to ""black oil"" to be a little more viscous.

The taste is initially of roasted malts, with coffee and smokey flavours there as well. As the warmth of the alcohol spreads through the mouth a glow of whisky emerges, just as if there had been a good shot of Highland Park slipped into the beer. It does not have the strong vanilla flavours of the American Bourbon barrel-aged beers, but it does possess a really complex mix of beer and whisky flavours, with a pleasing bitterness at the end to match the initial caramel (mildly vanilla) sweetness. This is a really special beer and is highly drinkable.","","Cimbasso"

Body is medium-medium-heavy, oily, slightly syrupy, medium-light, medium-fine carbonation with touch of burn. Slightly soapy texture. Flavor is huge dark woods: hickory/oak, leather, hints of brine, licorice and touch of smoked bark, forest in snow. Overall- delicious. The scotch-barrel aging blends in such that one isnt always aware of it (as in heavy bourbon-barrel aging.) Dark earthy forest wood notes are the highlight. Very complex and a tad bit deceiving.

This beer is intense on the palate; savory from front to finish, pointing towards the direction of Worcester sauce, very roasty, dried porcino, dark chocolate, and definitely a caramellic-creamy - but not quite vanilla-ish - component. The medium-bitter finish declines slowly but steadily and is not as brash as you could reasonably expect.

Really intriguing; its definitely a successful merging of whiskey and porter, and manages not to come off too boozy or unbalanced, unlike others Ive had in the past (Brewdogs series comes to mind). Quite good.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"

3658,"2013-09-24",4.1,"Im really looking forward to this one. Black, with a medium-brown head, no surprise. The aroma... ah, theres the engine oil. But so much better - with whiskey! The nose is full of roasted malts, soft, woody whiskey, and a touch of peat and/or smoke. Its soft, complex, and very impressive. It may not be for everyone, but theres not enough of that peatiness to turn off those who dont care much for it, or smoke for that matter. Some soy and/or steak sauce comes through a little as well. 

Its slick, and although is fairly light, has enough body to stand up to its chewy palate. The flavor is jam packed with delicious notes of alcohol, wood, whiskey, peat, smoke, and heavily roasted malts, leaving a nice numbness on the tongue. The whiskey coats the throat deliciously, contributing to its unique roasted finish. It has all the great flavors of an awesome smoky Scottish stout.. er, old ale, but mellow and smooth. If this really is an old ale, its the darkest, smokiest, smoothest old ale Ive ever had. Very impressive! This would be great with a steak.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

Nice one-finger thick bubbly creamy light brown head, good retention and lace. Looks good. Kind of an interesting, savory nose... Beef jerky? Roasty malts. Whiskey not as strong as I expected in this, but its noticeable. Call it balanced, in the nose. Barrel and wood are noticeable in the flavor. Much less sweet vanilla notes that Im used to from American whiskey barrel-aged brews. Bigger body. Light, crisp carbonation. Nice light chewiness to the aroma, good body. Good dark chocolate note. Light roasty coffee. Very good!","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
3658,"2013-02-23",3.6,"Nice dark ale with a wee dram in the bottle. Oily indeed, thick dark brown, almost black, with a respectable brown head. Aromas of chocolate, coffee and peaty smoke  yes, I was not even sure if the single malts of Orkney were peaty, but I did get a strong peaty vein in that nose. Nice. But as the beer warms up the aroma turns pungent, stinging, almost repugnant, somewhat resembling what one would whiff at a Ukrainian roadside toilet. The flavours are comfy, chocolate, roasts, the peat, that wee dram of single malt. Woody, strong, but comfy. It is a mouthful of warmth, and the finish is quiet, until it irradiates that wooden warmth in all directions from the tongue. Not bad indeed, but I dont know if I would have it over a choice of a nice dark ale or a peaty single malt.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"

This beer is as black as they come and for some reason appears sharp + glassy to my eye. Huge tabacco and peat aromas wafting off this, Im assuming the highland park barrels have something to do with this. First sip reveals super complex flavors, smooth roasted chocolate on the front end transitioning to peaty scotch notes finishing in (dont take this the wrong way) cigarettes on the back end. There is so much going on here each sip reveals new experiences. Good lacing as it goes down, this beer is somewhere different in the whole barrel-age the fuck out of everything thing thats going on these days and I like it and will seek it out.

3.0 A: Black color. Maybe a quarter finger of frothy light brown head that quickly fell and left no lacing. Ill cut it some slack since its so old.

5.0 S: This may be the strongest smelling and booziest of the series and also the best smelling. Tangy caramel, loads of chocolate, light coffee, vanilla combine to form a creme brulee type aroma. Molasses, a formitable earthiness, and peat and oak from the whiskey and barrel. Supple roast underneath. I wouldnt ask for a much better nose, but if I did, Id ask for a little more sweetness. 

3.0 T: The frailty of the base beer is quite apparent in the taste. Aside from roastiness and some chocolate, the taste is dominated by the whiskey instead of the whiskey playing complement to the base. Most of the flavors found in the nose are still there, but in vastly reduced amounts with chocolate, molasses, and caramel taking the biggest hits. Still a decent amount of vanilla and oak from the barrel and peat from the whiskey. Earthy mineral from the water.

2.0 M: Light to ligher medium body. Whatever the descriptors, its too thin. A good bit undercarbonated, but not quite flat. Lacking creaminess. 

2.5 D: These beers smell great, but then ultimately disappoint. The base for these is weak and the barrel overshadows it by far too much. Only the 18 year to go, then Im done with this unsatisfying, overpriced series.

Sweet and with touches of whisky are quite noticeable to begin with along with some peat and a burnt wood finish. There is a strong, roasted malt aroma as well and a lot of alcohol on the nose.

A strong, opaque black colour with a thumb sized, brown and foamy head that seems to hold well. It very gradually reduces in size but leaves some good lacing on the glass and eventually settles to a thin & patchy, soapy lacing.

Very whisky like in flavour with a lot of peat and alcohol upfront. It has strong, burnt oak and very, rich dark chocolate flavour with some dark fruits. It had a few different flavours fighting to be noticed but it is the whisky taste that comes across strongest, and far to strongly for my liking sadly.

Medium bodied and with a slightly chewy feel to it. There is a massive alcohol taste and burn at the end and a lingering malt flavour. Carbonation is very low with this beer.

Complex beer but sadly not one that I enjoyed, I felt the whisky aroma was too strong for me to enjoy the beer. I found this beer a huge struggle to finish. The whisky was too strong with this one.

Slightly oily mouthfeel that just sticks a bit. The taste is pretty decent, but lacks the character the nose has.

3658,"2012-02-04",2.6,"Pensively, philosophically, I give this an appearance of ""4"".... the head just isnt amazing enough, the body still a murky red-black instead of a distinctive colour. Therefore, almost there, but not quite. The aroma? Wet and burnt barley, a hint of hops, nothing too exciting for this style of beer, but at least it smells. The flavour is much the same, barley and hops thrown together without a thought of how they might dance together; wet finish. A shame, really, - theres no finesse here, no ""je ne sais quoi"", there is simply a heavy barley malt and some hops boiled together to make a stout-type brew. Sure, it works, its all right, but it doesnt stop your heart - not even with the alcohol content! It is just, ultimately, and sadly,,,, - average.","Alberta, CANADA","DeanF"
3658,"2012-02-04",4.1,"Binnys LP 330ml ($9): Pours black with a brown head (surprise... not really). Aroma is wonderful. Its like getting all the positive aspects of a Scotch aroma combined with all the positive aspects of a beer aroma. In other words, it is smoky and has a nice roasted malt backbone to bolster it up properly. Upon tasting it, I was expecting something significantly more intense, but I was by no means displeased with the content of my first sip. The Scotch is subdued, rather than overbearing like some barrel-aged beers (perhaps because I have mostly had experience with Bourbon aged). The body is way lighter than I anticipated and again this is a good thing. The bitterness of Old Engine Oil is taken down a notch, but still manifests itself. In short, the balance is excellent. The beer turned out to be a substantially better sipper than I thought, and I have no regrets.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

3658,"2012-01-20",4.0,"My Bottom Line :  
Intertwining smoke, wood, roast, peat and blackberry flavors lead to a lightly charred roastiness in the finish and an elegantly peat-y aftertaste.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A sheet of foam lays atop the blackness with dark brown edges.
-A light chocolate undertow seeps from the malt mélange. 
-The soft effervescence lets all flavors express themselves at will. But, amazingly, all show restraint. Truly classy from aroma to finish. 
-I found this one softer and easier to sip on than the other versions of Ola Dubh. Just a wonderful lineup overall.

I love the whisky, and that this is cask aged. Highland Park is in my top ten whiskies (because asking me to choose between them is like asking me to choose my favourite niece or nephew).
Big and oily. This first thing that comes to mind as well as the second and third things. Its a little sweet and then theres full on plumminess, fruitcake and molasses. Brandy even?

APPEARANCE: Black.

Hues of espresso brown. 

Head is practically inexistent; just some thin and sparse large bubbles. 


AROMA: Toasted and roasted malts, whiskey that appears to have hardly any smoky character, dark bitter chocolate, coffee, vanilla, caramel, wood, soy sauce.

Hints of earthy character. 


TASTE: Coffee, earthy, licorice, earthy-ish whiskey, herbal notes, dark bitter chocolate, soy sauce. Roast bitterness on finish. 

Soy sauce hints more prevalent than preferred. 


MOUTH FEEL: Thinner than expected, yet fairly boozy from the whiskey. 


OVERALL: Like a café Americano with a splash of whiskey, a dash of rich soil (ie, pleasant earthiness), and an unpleasant accidental drop of soy sauce.

IT pours a dark brown/black, the head is a greyish/brownish/tan and it is nicely foamy. It recedes pretty quickly with not much lacing.

The smell is very smooth and subtle. It isnt an over the top bourbon bomb in the nose. It has notes of chocolate, peat, scotch, and wood.

The scotch is intensified in the flavor as it almost takes center stage. It has a lot of peatiness, smoke, and barrel notes. There are also notes of tobacco and earthiness. It is a very earthy, organic tasting brew. The sweetness of the brew gets more intense as you go. It tastes very rustic.

It is pretty good, I wonder if the other editions would be better or worse, or any different.

Black in body as night in the countryside...Fantastic creamy beige-brown head that never disappeares fully, allury laces on the surface. Cocoa and rum, vanilla and burnt woods, tobacco and dried dark fruits in the liqueric nose. Complex aroma...and flavor too. Smooooth mouthfeel, fine carbonation with microbubbles in the oily but light body. Light vinous character lurking behind the fruity character.

Nose: oily, smoky, licorice, black root. Sweet leather underneath and leather oils, oily wood. Charcoal, earth, smoke, ash. Chunks of fudge, truffles. Tobacco leaf, cigars. Marshmallow mingles with the fudge for some rocky road action.

Palate: creamy, silky, and oily mouthfeel. Fudges, melted caramels, truffles, turtles. Warmth of melted caramel and nougat in the back. Tar and ash in the finish, lingers on the top back of tongue. Brownies and more fudge. Tobacco leaf rounds it out with some spice, dirt, tobacco leaf, black earth and roots. Immediate and lingering warmth in breath.

3658,"2010-11-13",3.5,"An inky pour, that is indeed as black as engine oil, lifts a solid mocca head; this falls quickly and leaves not much lacing.  The nose wears its barrel aging on its sleeve, giving up peat, ash, vanilla, wood, chocolate and coffee.  And theres all the roasted malt youd expect of an imperial stout.  In the mouth this all continues to a honeyed, hoppy end.  The whiskey and peat is soft, with all of the edges being very rounded - almost to the point of my wanting just one discordant flavour to give it a bit of oomph.  But it wears its sweet simplicity well, finishing with a certain coffee note.  The peat disappears quickly, although a creamy vanilla remains.  As this is the 12 year old, I imagine everything grows in boldness and complexity as the series continues.  So its a good start.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","theSlipperyPen"

3658,"2009-06-03",4.3,"Bottle purchased at Buckeye Beer Engine.  I have been sitting on the 30 and 12 versions for quite a while now, so I decided to go out and get a 12 to try and see if I want to hold off on the other 2, or dive right in.  The aroma of this right off the bat was something else.  It reminded me of some good cured olives.  The pour is a deep dark black which required a rough pour to give it a wonderful thick cream head on top.  The aroma, once my nose got right up next to the beer is very smokey, lots of character is given off from the barrels, so much so that there robust smokey malt flavors from the Highland Scotch actually come through here.  Jesus, it has been years since I have had Scotch, but this brings me back.  The rest of this beer is just a huge malt profile that has been put to bed.  It is so smooth that it just goes down so smooth.  The alcohol is hidden completely, and the chocolaty malt flavors just get to come in like none other.  This has adopted the barrel conditioning better, and more drastically, than any other beer I can think of.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","MAP"

3658,"2009-03-07",3.3,"In short: An unclassifiable moderately roasted black beer with a nice flavour spectrum.  Not very tasty and lack of carbonation
How: Bottle 11.2oz.  Drank about 1 year after the beer release.  Side by side comparison of the Old Dubh 12, 16 and 30
The look: Almost black body with almost no head
In long: Light but interesting nose of peat, dirty wood, earth and date.  The whisky sure is not much apparent from on the nose.  Carbonation in my bottle was abnormally soft, dont know if its normal, but the 16 and 30 year old that I bought the very same day from the very same store had a soft carbonation but this 12 is cask-like soft.  Unlighted charcoal, burnt fresh wet wood, black liquorice, a whole lot of peat including freshly cut green grass.  Without a doubt the least interesting of the three.

Its a good looking beer. Fantastic aroma. The Highland Park is clearly evident and the Old Engine oil is equally apparent. They meld really well and the end result is wonderfully rich and verging on decadent. Sumptuous chocolate, full of dark dried fruit, slight caramel, good earthy notes, brown sugar, clear brandy and maybe a hint of marzipan. Complex and hugely sniffable. Well worth a nine. The flavour is not quite as elaborate as the nose and just never quite feels properly integrated. The whisky still feels a little raw and the end result is that of the standard Engine Oil (which I must say, is still a good beer) with a bit of the Highland Park added rather than it being imparted following maturation. I would certainly like it if there was a little more of the barrel showing. That said its certainly an enjoyable experience. The palate is excellent and the glowing warmth on the way down is a delight.

The finish has a firm bitterness from the hops and burnt malts, while the peaty smoke lasts through the long aftertaste.

As it is, theres a definite, but reserve note of alcohol, a bit of char and vanilla. A little cocoa underneath that.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

3658,"2008-05-08",3.6,"Bottle @ Vinordic 080426. Pours jet black and oily. In your face smokiness from the whisky and a lingering burnt licorice malt background. You can definately recognize the Highland Park on the heathery, salt smokiness. Some dried friuts and bitter orange marmalade is there. Thick mouthfeel, quite like its name - old engine oil. Not quite homogenous mix of stout and whisky, the beer comes through a bit too burnt and viscuous. Interesting though.","Mölndal, SWEDEN","Gusgus"

Moderately transparent mahogany body with a light tan head that disspates quicker than the 16 year.  Nice legs and slightly more transparent than the 16.

Roasty coffee flavors up front with a strong smokey scotch middle and a caramel/dark chocolate finish with a little bitterness. Reminscent of a smoked porter. Very very good but a sipper to be sure.

3658,"2008-04-21",4.0,"Bottle # 11243 and served in my NB worthy glass (vertical of 12/18/30): Nearly opaque with a fading but lasting head and minimal lace but some oily legs upon the glassware. The aroma has notes of charred wood and Black Patent malt, star anise, sun ripened prune, heavy liquid vanilla extract, massive alcohol vapours, and some lovely smoked peat bog.  The taste starts with a robust porter malt roundhouse followed by a right jab of twangy fruit finishing with a knockout uppercut of boozy scotch and wood flavors. What ever hop bitterness that may have been in the beer is long gone. Swallowed by a wonderful complex earthy and herbal character.  The mouth feel is sharp and oily with a noticeable warming about the chest.

3658,"2008-04-18",3.4,"Bottle 04111, September 2007 Date; sampled April 2008
A vigorous pour produces a two-finger thick, frothy, fairly large bubbled, creamed cocoa-brown colored head.  The beer is almost indistinguishable from black, but does show a touch of deep, dark, burnt-amber color if held up directly to the light.  Wow, this smells like a rich, savory candy that is a mix of teriyaki, sesame, and concentrated toffee.  Underneath this are substantial aromatic notes of prunes and dried figs that are joined by softer, but quite distinct notes of salty, smoky peat reek.  Molasses aromatics play a huge role, just a confluence of the sweet, concentrated malt and the savor malt and peat character.  This beer is dripping with umami aromatics; rich, savory, hearty & a concentrated, aged malt character that is just oozing drops of intense malt character.

Thick, but quite a bit lighter than might be suggested by the aroma; in fact it has a thinness that I was expecting before I cracked this beer and smelled the concentrate aroma.  Flavors of lightly sweet, yet rich, molasses, Hoisin sauce, concentrated graham crackers, buttery toffee and burnt salt-water taffy; really this beer is not all that sweet, but just enough to keep the richness in check.  The finish is dried out quite a bit by a lingering, slightly astringent, light bitter, burnt malt character that adds flavors of cold-pressed black coffee, .  The whisky notes are fairly soft here, I think it is mostly a salty, smoky peat-derived character that shows up; it most definitely adds to the richness of this brew.

The flavor of this beer is quite a bit better and richer if you take a few minutes rest between sips, without doing this the beer somehow comes off as being a bit thin.  The molasses like character of this brew is perhaps as big as I have ever tasted in a beer and this mixes quite well with a solid smokiness that is quite pleasing to my palate.  An interesting beer; I definitely like the balance and character that the barrel aging has brought as it is not too overwhelming here.

3658,"2008-04-17",4.6,"Here we go folks. This one pour blackish with a modest spattered head that reduces slowly leaving behind textbook lacework. The aroma is delicious  to say the least with an aroma I remember from childhood. It was a smoky marinade recipe for pork chops that my grandfather held close to his vest. It was an aroma that made my mouth water. Smoky Worcestershire, leather, iodine, grilled steak, and dough. Medium nectar and low carbonation with soft and creamy effers. Mildly sweet and smoky with a  moderate roast. A defined and penetrating bittering component adds to this complex brew a worthy drinkability. Flavors of smoky sweet malts, roasted peat and coffee bean, leather, iodine, Worcestershire sauce, cocoa, aspirin. The finish is bittered well and a smoky lingering like a fire put out stains my palate. Overall: this is a rather exotic brew with defined  barrel influence although mild. Its refined rather than over the top and very delicious indeed.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"

Dark chocolate flavors in the front with a touch of pale malt sweetness. A little light fruit and vanilla. Mild whisky, Im reminded of a single malt that has has a bit too much water added to cut it. FInish has some more dark chocolate and and some roasted malt.

3658,"2008-04-15",4.0,"Bottle from Brandon.  Thanks.  I have seen this in the stores, but never bought any- now that I know it is aged in a Scotch barrel, I will probably seek out the rest.  Very dark color, black almost, with a little bit of a tan head on it.  Smell is smoky peat, fruity, chocolate, some alcohol, but mostly dominated by peat.  Taste is smooth and very much like drinking a scotch.  The Highland Park really shows in this beer, and since I drink nothing but scotch, it is a very good thing to see a beer aged in a Scotch cask.  More brewers need to catch on and do this.  I could only imagine how much better this would be if it was actually aged in a good Scotch cask.  Very good stuff, a no brainer for me.

3658,"2008-04-09",3.7,"12oz bottle. Pours black, as in the name. In some ways this is like other whiskey-barrel aged beers (Goose Island Bourbon Stout, etc), but the use of Scotch -- Highland Park especially -- adds more depth, I think. Instead of being entirely about sweet wood, the beer, though fairly sweet, stays a little bit drier and has some smoke and peat to it. Other than that, notes of caramel, coffee, vanilla, nuts, toast. Ive only had this one, though it would be interesting to see how much the beer changes with the use of different Highland Park barrels.","New York, New York, USA","nparikh"

Flavor is great but just a bit too faint. The oak really stands out, melding well with the chocolate and roasted flavors. I dont detect any fruitiness, which is odd for an old ale.

The glaring thing about this beers mouthfeel is the thinness of body. It may look really viscous but its quite light.

3658,"2008-03-23",3.7,"The same appearance as the Special 16 and 30 editions, i.e., solid black with a typical Porter-ish beige head.  The smell, this time around, was more carob beans, chicory, and chocolate.  The taste was easy drinking with a lot of wood tannins and roast grains.  The body was kind of thin and underwhelming, but the finish was sprinkled with some spicy hops.  I guess I just prefer the obvious Whisky notes of 30 than the astringency of the 16 or the woodiness of the 1.  All of them are subtly different from each other, yet they ll succeed in their own way.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
3658,"2008-03-21",3.5,"Thanks to Dave from By The Bottle for this brew.  Poured a brown-black body with a small off-white/beige-grey head.  Nutty, bourbon nose with some dry wood esters.   Thin, watery mouth feel and finish.  Sweet, but couldnt get past watery factor.  Still, a very interesting beer, especially considering many UK beers can be boring.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Angeloregon"
3658,"2008-03-21",3.6,"12 oz bottle from Bev4less in Santee. Pours a blackish brown with a meager tan head that quickly fades to a tiny ring. The aroma was strong with anise, whiskey, dates, coffee liquor and molasses. The taste did not quite live up to the bold aroma. The flavors are subdued with whiskey, coffee and peat. Most of these flavors are on the  the sides of the tounge but the tip and back are never rounded out for a full palate experience. The mouthfeel was full and creamy. The finish abruptly fell off short with a lingering malt pastiness. Overall: This one showed a lot of promise and had one of the best noses ever, but the flavor was too subtle for me, and left me with an empty feeling.  I may age a bottle or two and re-evaluate later.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"
3658,"2008-03-21",4.4,"Bottle: 02048 Sept. 07:  The best of the three (12, 16, 30 year). A very nice smooth combination of fruitiness with nice Scotch maltiness.  Great munchiness in the taste. Ending is somewhat like coffee, but again with that lovely scotch accent.  Overall, the best of the three to balance taste variation with exoticness.  Very nice accents of peat, malt, dark fruits (plums, dates etc...), with a rich malt and almost caramel ending thats accented with a good 12 year Scotch (I recommend Glenlivets 12 year).  I really wish more breweries would age their beers in Scotch barrels as its my favorite whisky. *hopes*","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Numenor"

Wildflower honey in the finish. Not your typical Old Ale by any means. Finished like a Turkish coffee spiked with a shot of Scotch Whisky.

3658,"2008-03-17",4.2,"33cl bottle (numbered #10497). Pours an opaque black with a very thin, brown head. The head fades into a miniscule, uneven film of very tiny bubbles with a ring of bigger bubbles around the edges of the glass - quite attractive, actually. The aroma is strong and complex. It starts with some meaty, almost savory, notes that blend with a very earthy aroma of peat (soily and vegetal). There are also aromas of alcohol and of luxurious, thick, super-dark, bitter chocolate. A fantastic combination. The flavor starts sweet and roasty with some hints of smoke and peaty earth. The sweetness is dry and bitter, like strong coffee or espresso with sugar in it. The roast strengthens by mid-palate; and add to that notes of dark fruit (just a slight hint of acid?) and a earthy and fruity hop bitterness. The finish is full and dominated by roasty flavors of espresso and dark toast (though not burnt - less roasty and acrid than some stouts). The finish also has a decent bit of hop bitterness and fruity esters. The mouthfeel is quite full with a creamy and slightly oily feel to it. The carbonation is slight and is just enough to tickle the front of the tongue. Overall, a great beer - interesting and delicious.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

The flavor pretty peaty as well.  Definitely can tell its been scotch barrel aged.  Nice smooth chocolate and dark sweet malts seem to balance out the peat pretty well, although it certainly isnt the most prevalant character.  Very tasty brew.

3658,"2008-03-14",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 30, 2008 Bottle.

Pours dark rich brown, almost black, grey-tan head. Nice smoky peaty nose, barrel wood. The flavor nicely balances dark chocolates with the smoke, peat, and wood from the whisky. The flavors --- basically oil engine oil and peaty, smoky, whisky --- dont blend particularly much but they complement one another surprisingly well. It may not be the match made in heaven that takes the whole way beyond the sum of its parts, but it works as far more than a novelty, and Im pleased by that. The beer remains enjoyable throughout, a thick, rich, very nice mouthfeel, mildly carbonated, good body, gently warming more in the stomach than on the tongue or throat.

3658,"2008-03-12",3.8,"(bottle, thanks Badgerben!) Pours a dark brown with an off-white head.  Aroma is initially quite odd and smells just like a urinal cake, not too appealing.  Thankfully this is only a brief smell and as the beer warms it disappears.  The aroma then switches to barbecue sauce with some strong smokiness too.  The taste was also very smoky with chocolate appearing and strongly asserting itself in the mid-palate, which then yielded to an incredibly long smoked/peaty finish.  The mouthfeel is a little thin, and I wouldve scored the palate lower, but that incredibly long finish warranted a four.  Overall, a pretty good beer.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
