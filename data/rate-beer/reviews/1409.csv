1409,"2014-01-07",4.2,"The nose is spectacular. There is a malty bearing on the nose that promises richness and depth. It¬ís sweet but not cloying. It¬ís rich but not too nutty. There is a brilliant hop character on the nose that is at once both vibrant and restrained. It is as though a bountiful fruit character wants to explode from them but instead you have a perfect floral sweetness. A succulence that is the essence of the hops it self without embellishment. There is a bit of spice or pepper to the nose that is firm but not too loud. 

The mouthfeel is incredible. Smooth, full of flavor and yet light. It travels with ease over the palate with the grain sporting a bit of dapper complexity even thought it does not evidence many flavors. It has a layered sweet presence that deepens and enriches the beer. It is also a dry grain that takes the mid palate. There is a bounty of hops on the palate that never evidence any fruit you can name although they seem ready to burst forth. They are sweet and delectable in and of themselves and their restraint is no loss to the perfect balance of this beer. Smooth. Not bitter although you can taste the bitter from the hops subtly as if a shadow. A touch fo alcohol grazes the palate and it is finished now. 

This beer is pristine and wonderful. It is brewed with care and expertly in accord with the purity laws of 1516.

1409,"2013-12-21",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2017 Pours a dark brown clear color with glowing ember hints in it, and has a huge, fluffy eggshell head on top.

Smells of flowery grass, dried lemon peel and caramel. Its rustic bread maltiness defines the very inviting foundation in this, with an extra layer of herbal hops on top.

Very refreshing with a lively carbonation, countering sweet malts and dry hops and therefore establishes a very well working balance, disguising perfectly the higher octane level of the beer. 

Tastes of an aqueous softness which slowly develops whole grain bread, caramel, bakers chocolate and toasted nutshells. A split second after this becomes established, herbal, utmost dry hops hammer down on the palate. The immediate, uncompromising hop impact gets very well balanced by the cleaning effervescence and sweet toffee, creating a truly enjoyable drinking experience.

This is the Uerige Alt*2, featuring a remakable hop dryness, which you won¬ít find in any other traditional german top fermented ale. This is far away from being a malt defined Dunkel, this here comes in to kick some butt. It wouldn¬ít be a well crafted beer if despite its strong headed aporoach maintains a great easiness in drinking. Those two aspects combined together make up for a great beer.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Pours a fairly-hazy dark tawny-mahogany with a thick off-white head that lasts for awhile and leaves quite a bit of lacing behind. The nose brings forward a good amount of bread crust and some earthy hops. Dry malt and a slight bit of roast. The flavor brings some light malty toasted character and some bread crust. Along with that, there¬ís some earthy hops and an accompanying dryness. Light caramel character in there as it warms more, though the earthy hops really begin to take over, especially with the bitterness in the finish. Medium body and lighter carbonation.

This beer has no place in the low countries, it is as German as apple pie. But place it before a podium and slap a microphone in its hands and this beer will deliver a stump speech! It boasts as much head as the headless horseman, but twice as irreverent. Not to mention, the Eurige Sticke is very much the product of modern science, and has even been known to cure instances of bum leg. Picture the ethereal haze of the midlands at dusk, you¬íve captured its essence. Flavors of light berries, filbert nuts, circus peanuts, tousled hair, green iris, and Raid insecticide - and not in an unpleasant way. That is to say this beer is very unpleasant. But the kind of unpleasance that jostles you from your complacent ways and prompts you to travel the world!

6 RIch brown mushroomy aroma. A little savoury
4 Lovely deep hazy brown, small tight light-beige head.
6 Massive grainy husky barky taste - coming in at the malt levels of a doppelbock, but without quite the same level of sweetness. Maybe a touch yeasty, as I let a bit of the sediment come over. Some gentle hops too, but they can¬ít compete with the malts.
3 Full palate, decent carbonation. Finish carries both the barky aspects from the taste and the gentle bitterness. Feels like it might be a little drying, but doesn¬ít end up that way in the end, it¬ís not too sweet or to resiny.

The beer starts heavily roasted malt and pleasantly bitter and very spicy, slightly bitter chocolaty tones play in the background. By the further course, the hop bomb explodes more and more, and the beer reminds me on a good American IPA. The finish gets more chocolaty, and there, the hops are joining a long finish.

1409,"2009-12-21",3.6,"11.2 fl oz swing top bottle purchased at Lukas in Kansas City, Missouri. Bottled on 10.08 code 09.09. Opens with a pop. Pour is hazed orange copper brown with a lasting three inch creamy off white head. Head falls eventually with thick foamy lacing. Aroma of fresh grass, herbal hay and slight lemon citrus element. Under that is an almost minty grain element. The freshness of the nose really surprised me; given the age of this bottle(perhaps I am just misreading the bottled on, perhaps this is August 10th, not October 2008) I was expecting something a bit duller. Taste is clean grain biscuit sweet malt up front, followed quickly by the grass hay herbal and citrus of the nose. The finish has some nice yeast character to it, showing some clove and spice. Palate is medium, with active carbonation. Really satisfying and easy to drink.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

Carbonation is modest but gets the job done. This beer is exceptionally smooth. The light bitterness in the finish tempts you into the next sip.

1409,"2007-10-18",3.2,"Uerige Sticke¬ís distinctively craggy bottle and its ambiguously pointed super ""U"" give it a prominent place on the beer shelf no matter what height it sits at.  The long, gun-barrel pour whips up a clotted and webby head, its many bubbly threads clinging tenuously to the glass.  The acorn colored liquor is murky and hazy, hinting at a well developed and assertive flavor.  Verification comes in the aroma where an array of spices affix themselves to strong and obstreperous flavors - cinnamon with honey, raisin with leather, all-spice with wildflower.  The alcohol is strong too, accentuating the stinging leather flavor to a chemical burn.  The obligatory hops profile merges with the spices to produce Uerige¬ís distinctive tongue raking sensation, but is subtly tamed by a droplet or two of white grape juice sweetness.  Despite the Uerige¬ís aromatic assault, furiously engaging the olfactory with a barrage of intense, pungent rounds, the flavor is unusually plain and neutral.  A quick dip of the tongue in the beer invokes a springtime flowerbed, tempered by an unexpected cloud of chalk and dust.  This transmogrifies what would otherwise be a nice, pure floral note into a aged, senescent potpourri - not too palatable.  Hops and grapefruit escort Uerige the rest of the way to a brief aftertase, after which the beer¬ís extravagant carbonation muddles any remaining flavor, criss-crossing the taste with cutting bubbles.  It is yet another case of a beer¬ís internecine flavor profile, with an over eager carbonation vying against the delicate flavors for control of the palate.  The carbonation almost always wins.  With a mouthfeel wresting control of the flavor and hijacking my tastebuds I can¬ít help but think the beer is a bit of a bust, but let me tell you, the bottle makes an incredible infused oil container for those of you who are culinarily inclined.  Might even be worth the pricetag.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

The flavor is also malty, but not overly sweet.  The malt flavor in the Uerige Sticke is definitely darker tasting (not necessarily roasted; caramelized is probably most apropos) than the Uerige Alt.  The malt is balanced by a reserved hop presence and bitterness level.  There is also a little bit of fruit in the flavor that is difficult to describe (maybe dark berries?).

1409,"2007-02-03",4.2,"Poured into a tall, straight sided Gosser glass, the beer is a clear reddish copper color, with about an inch of creamy colored foam. Surprisingly effervescent, but the head dies down in short order to a thin cap. No lacing. Nice clean malt in the aroma, with just a touch of a canned peach scent in the aroma.

A bold, crisp, clean and almost toffee-like maltiness gives way to a subtle floral/spicy hop finish. Still rather prominent in the carbonation, but without a bite from the fizz. Great classic German flavor. The flavor did not hold up when paired with a bold Glouchester cheese, however. Then again, an English/German dynamic is sometimes better avoided.","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"

Taste; mmm..lots of malts, caramel and molasses. Dried figs, and cherries, walnuts and some allspice. There¬ís just a bit of a hop bitterness towards the end to balance it out a bit.

Bloody shame!Needless to say, this beer does not seem to hold up very well in the bottle, especially after one year. The aroma had pronounced notes of prune that must have been from oxidation.

<!-- p -->This is not the first I¬íve had this beer; it¬ís become a regular in the rotation.  I definitely prefer the stuff at a warmer temp, over 65F even, so I usually just chill it a bit and then let it sit in the glass for a while before drinking it.  The color is a soft, dark, honey-amber with thick and lasting off-white head leaving classic lace.  The aromas are addictive, concentrated, and bready with old grasses, peppery greenery (the stuff reminds me of shrubs and yardwork for some reason), and sourdough pancake batter, bubbly and raw.  Herbal and spice notes leap to the fore with the first sip with white pepper, anise, and allspice.  Smoothing out in the middle the beer introduces a toffee sweetness coating the mineral notes of a musty apple.  There¬ís a mild nuttiness that pervades, but more nutty like toasted bread than any particular sort of nut.  The eff is fine and adding to a creamy soft feel, rich and tending toward slick.  The finish is long and bready with a fresh tang that kicks in the last.  Really enjoyable stuff, plenty complex without going overboard in any arena.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

1409,"2005-10-12",3.5,"(330 ml swing-top bottle: $3.69 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) While not as impressive looking as the regular Uerige Alt, this one is far more tasty, so I¬íll gladly take that trade-off.  Malty, sweet, a bit earthy, only slightly bitter, and showing a pleasant nuttiness and a good bit of smokiness in the finish, this is reminding me of a really malty English ale.  The aromatic nose is malty, earthy and a bit smoky.  Medium in body and lightly carbonated, this goes down all too easy.  Light brown in color, just a shade darker than the Uerige Alt, and slightly hazy in appearance.  Very little actual head develops during or after the pour, just a sheen actually, but there are clumps of large bubbles that form during the pour.  So, not much of a looker, but this is delicious.

Aroma is quite good, heavy on malt, with plum, purne, a little bubblegum, and some resiny hop.  Flavor is very nice, very malty with a vinous finish on the first sip.  This has a really long lasting finish due to its mouth coating palate.  Mouthfeel is perfect, just the right amount of carbonation sot that it doesn¬ít interfere with tasting the flavor.  Hop bitterness comes out more as the beer warms and really balances the malt well.  This stuff¬ís pretty awesome, very recommended.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

I have to admit, I¬ím a bit of a ""bottle whore"" and that¬ís what attracted me to this beer...  a well crafted and unique swing-top with sparse labels and a healthy dose of raised lettering in the glass, including a line of braille at the bottom! Excellent!
Appearance was an almost-mahogany body, slightly hazed with a creamy, little head. Aromas were well malted with raisin, honey & caramel over grains and earthiness... an overall impression of a sweet breakfast cereal. Nicely balanced flavors with sweet malts proving dominance. Smooth and slightly thick on the tongue with a touch of alcohol at the end that made me smile. Quite delicious. Hoping to find a bigger bottle.

Pours a brilliantly clear ruby amber color that is topped by a frothy, thinnish, tan colored head.  The aroma is quite fruity with notes of brandy, and rum, hints of strawberry, citrus and lightly spicy notes.  Actually a fairly interesting aroma that is still intriguing after these 6 months.  The taste is lightly sweet and fairly malty with notes of caramel.  This is quite fruity as well with notes of cherry, raisins, and a bit of strawberry and some notes of bergemot as well.  For some reason the fruity character in an Alt I have always associated as an interesting mix of hop and malt character.  This has held up much better, in the voyage across the Atlantic, than the regular Alt did, though it stills suffers quite a bit from the voyage.

I was told that the Florida only got 14 cases for the entire state, and one of my local homebrew shops bought up 5 of those, which should last another couple of weeks. 

 Pours a dark copper body with a bountiful light tan head. The aroma and flavor offer a full dose of caramel malt and certainly a heap of pilsner malt. Slightly toasty, toffee notes, toasted wheat bread similarities. The hops are very refined.. I think they are more present in the aroma and then again in the lingering finish than anything else. Nice oaky woodsy suggestions. - Man.. Something just made me think about an old girlfriend I had many years ago¬Ö Every time I think of oak like flavors I always think of her for some odd reason.

This beer pours with a massive light tan head and a mostly transparent amber body.  Starts a bit sweet, and chewy with some caramel malty sweetness.  Light minerals and metallic hints are present in the middle.  Finishes with some diacetyl buttery character.  Mildly toasted finish.  The mouthfeel is a bit flat, and lacking carbonation.

Taste has some delicate nuances and subtleties, starts smooth and inviting with tame caramel and light toasty malts but gradually builds with nuts and grassy floral hop tones that are very mild on the bittering, but really nice to let unravel. Bits of whole grain toast make a nice appearance just past midway. Very lovely in that regards, real nice. Finishes with some sweeter candyish fruity malts mixing with the hop tones and toast and drys out very calmly. Super fine and yummy finish.

Rich layers of caramel, toast, brown sugar and hints of fruit (a touch of grape, a hint of cherry) led to a surprisingly bitter earthy hops finish with metallic notes.  As the beer warmed the sweet caramely malts and toast became more dominant.  Very rich mouthfeel- this is one smooth beverage.

1409,"2004-03-30",3.9,"I've been looking for a replacement for the awesome Blimp City Akron/Macon Ale since they went out of business, and I think I have found it! The beer is a dark brown/amber with an ultra thin off-white head. Very little lacing. The aroma is nice and full, with caramel, malt and sweet fruit. Medium-bodied and very drinkable with a pleasing blend of flavors such as malt, raisin, caramel and hops. The finish is the only place it falls off a little. There is a slight metallic tinge to the fruity finish that was out of character with the beer. A slightly bigger hops finish would make it nearly perfect. As it stands though, this is one of the better Alts I have had.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
1409,"2004-03-29",4.2,"A truly amazing alt bier that really impresses.  A nice malty caramel back bone with a good hop bitterness.  The hops are present but not at all obtrusive.  For 65IBU's one would never guess.  Truly a world classic.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","stefanberggren"
1409,"2004-03-29",4.1,"My bottle had the same numbers as the one at left (29.01 on top and 29.02 on the bottom).  Good soft light brown color, with some light ambers and fuzzy peaches.  Aroma of soft fuzzy hops, lightly sticky caramel malt and some damp musty basement notes.  The flavor was soft, mild and lightly warming, but the mouthfeel blew me away.  This is the epitome of soft, even delicateness, without being thin.  Lightly sweet throughout, (light caramel, light brown fruits) and a hint of brown sugar perhaps.    Hops are smooth and nowhere near as bitter as I would expect from this.  Extremely drinkable, supremely balanced and I can't say I noticed any alcohol.  Has a faint peachy warming sensation on the finish after it has warmed considerably.  Exquisite.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1409,"2004-03-28",4.4,"Bottled: Delightful, through and through.The aroma is soft chewy caramel and flowery hops, grassy. Yes, burnt plastic, slightly sweet maltiness abounds in the flavors (it's a hellofafine burnt plastic, this) - did someone say some peach?, yes, I concur. But the melding, the balance of the grassiness with the slightly acrid sweetish malt, is what astounds here. The only flaw is the slight alcoholic thinning at the full warm level. Shows how good Blimp City's version really was (Arbor Brewing #22 and McNeill's are off style comparitively, but in the case of the latter much fuller bodied and in the former too carbonated) - Damn, I love a hoppy alt (this is 65 IBUs, I think?) - I'm in love with this thing.","≈Å√≥d≈º, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"

1409,"2004-03-20",3.6,"Might be a case where the anticipation drowned out the the flavor.  Defintiely thinner than I antcipated, with a metallic hop presence that I found a little off-putting.

Toasty Mucich malt aroma w/a light roast and very, very light caramel;  Slight floral hop behind everything else as it warms.  Flavor starts out w/ toasty malt, very well balanced, but quickly turns pleasantly bitter that lasts well into the finish and aftertaste; light roasty w/ some hop flavor in the finish as well, finishes on the dry side.  Very clean and crisp.  Light medium body w/ low carbonation and a slightly prickly feeling from CO2, but very smooth overall.  This is what I imagined a D. Alt to taste like if I'd ever had one before this point.  Very clean and pleasantly bitter; It has Czech Pils rounded bitterness w/ a Munich Dunkel grain characteristic, but lighter and more delicate.  Great stuff!","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

Beautiful.","Reno, Nevada, USA","NVBeer232"

The hops lean more towards the grassy side than the outright bitter side. The malt is very grainy and ""cereal-like"" as another reviewer pointed out. Very pleasant and dangerously drinkable. Damn good beer! I'll need to stock up on this one. Surprisingly lighter mouthfeel than expected. It's almost whispy.

The color of the beer is light auburn. Carbonation levels are low, but this makes the beer easy to drink. I find the beer hard to describe, it reminds me of a light bock or a big dunkel.

Smooth malt balanced with a big hop bitterness. What I love about this the most is the way the incredible smooth malt lingers right through the lingering hop bitterness aftertaste. From homebrewing with the White Labs Dusseldorf Alt yeast a few times, this beer has the distinctive alt flavor that you would look for and the smoothness of a lager. Rant rant rave rave.

1409,"2004-02-25",2.8,"Massively bitter!  I'm talking DFH 90-minute IPA bitter, here, folks.  And it lingers, in a roasty, burnt malt with hops sort of way.  In fact, the hops taste as if they were badly charred before they went into the brew.  I, for one, can't handle it due to its having no other dimension but the hops (the malt seems to have taken the day off), but I'm sure others will love it.  I feel there's a huge disconnect between the beer I drank (pictured) and the ratings of others.  I have no idea why that is.

Almost an English ale in the nose with caramel, toffee and sweet malt and a delicate hoppiness. Good balance of butterscotch, banana and hop flavour in the mouth and a lingering long sweet caramel and hop bitter finish. This must be superb fresh from a wooden cask.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"
1409,"2003-10-27",3.7,"(bottled 2003 version) Chestnut brown, orange shine; yellow-brown head, not very ample. Nose is surprisingly dominated by caramel-aroma; some chocolate and a vague shrubbery aroma. Taste is very bitter; combination of hops and roasted malts, flavours of hopoil, black chocolate, cookies, but some cardboard too. Quite well-bodied, bitterness is not long-lasting but more instantaneous, coming up very hoppy and than fading away. It's my second time to taste Sticke, first time bottled. But the impression is the same as the draught on the premisses: I strangely prefer the regular Alt! That is more honest hops, and the ultimate drinking ale (Westmalle Extra possibly excluded). It's still extremely good all the same - shame about the lame nose.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
