4030,"2017-04-14",4.1,"16 oz. shared by Chalumeaux. The nose is mild grassy, grapefruits, mild lemons. The taste is very flavorful. Plenty of orange citrus, mild tropical fruits, light grass. Light-bodied, with moderate effervescent tingle. I will say that as far as flavor and gravity... It drinks more like a 7 percent or above. Tons of flavor. This is worthy of some hype. Not sure I am standing in a 3 hour line for it. But it IS the Treehouse I remember from before the hype train rolled into town.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

Good stuff.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
4030,"2017-03-04",3.9,"La canette souvre sur un liquide jaune orangé, complètement voilé, qui nous donne un bon doigt de carbonatation. Au nez cest complètement fruité, avec mangue, papaye et fruit de la passion qui domine complètement le terrain de jeu. Les arômes sont impressionnantes. En bouche, cest aussi fruité quau nez, avec des mangues et le fruit de la passion en attaque dès quon commence à boire. Cest littéralement un cocktail de fruits exotiques, sans amertume aucune, avec la petite signature Tree House en bouche qui mest difficile de décrire en mots. La bière est excellente, certes, mais il me manque un petit quelque chose, une complexité, pour quelle soit réellement mémorable.

4030,"2017-02-17",3.4,"Pours a cloudy golden with a small white heae that leaves good lacing. Nose didnt feel quite right to me with lots of cotton candy, burnt sugar and some candied citrus. Taste is more on the perfume side but you still get some burnt sugar. Moderately bitter. Body and carbonation are moderate, mouthfeel is a little juicy but not quite enough. Overall a weak pale ale for Tree House and Im starting to think there was a problem with our can. I didnt enjoy it much and would rather stick with Trillium (who seem to be much more consistent).","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

4030,"2017-01-20",2.4,"16oz can. Pours cloudy straw yellow with a small white head. Aroma is papaya, mango, dough, and pine. Taste is dough, mango, guava, pine, and just a hint of lemon. Moderate tropical fruit tartness up front. Finishes with a lot of resin-y pine. Relatively bitter. Yeast and pine linger unpleasantly. Medium Body. Medium carbonation - but it hits a little harshly. Oily but somewhat watery mouthfeel.","Massachusetts, USA","tapefuzz"
4030,"2016-09-25",4.3,"16 oz can. Pours a very hazy and turbid golden orange color that I stopped by a small, smooth layer of off white foam that settles slowly to a thin film. The aroma is bursting with fresh tropical fruits with mango, papaya, and fresh peach all noticeable along with grassy and dank pine notes over a soft, toasted bread malt base. The hops and tropical fruits are the star here though. The flavor follows with the fresh tropical and citrus fruits right up front with the mango, papaya, orange, and melon all shining to go with the dank grassy flavor from the hops. Very juicy with moderate hop bitterness and just enough malt backbone to balance things out and add some texture. Medium bodied with balanced carbonation and a soft, pillowy mouthfeel that leads to a dry, fruity, and slightly bitter finish. Incredibly drinkable with a near perfect mouthfeel and a crazy amount of fresh fruit. Pretty amazing the aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel that this beer achieves at such a low abv. Easily one of the best pale ales period and a true pleasure to drink.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

4030,"2016-08-05",4.2,"Une robe embrouillée mais pas aussi marécageuse que les IPAs de Tree House est surmontée dun col mousseux plutôt mince mais persistant. Des pêches, de la mangue bien mûre et juteuse et une pointe dagrumes percent les narines. Quelques notes plus végétales sont également détectées, mais rien dalarmant.

4030,"2016-08-02",3.7,"Can. The pour is a hazy orange with a thick head. The aroma is full of fruity hops, mostly papaya. The taste is good mix of hops and fruit.

4030,"2016-07-29",3.9,"Canned 07/22/16. Barely a week on it. Pours hazy unfiltered Tree House fruit juice, orange golden glow. Aroma is pine, dank orange juice, mango, peach, tangerine. Oh yea, thats a Tree House. Flavor is peach (I always seem to get peach in the Tree House beers Ive had so far), pine, mango. Papaya was subtle for me, but its there. Body is noticeably more effervescent, less soft than say, Julius, but still quite pillowy, and noticeable that its an APA than an IPA. But, as it gets warmer, it does become increasingly pillowy (though that could just be b/c ts losing carbonation). So, for an APA, I gotta say its amazing. And great artwork on the can too!","New York, USA","SG111"

4030,"2016-03-11",4.5,"Canned 2/8/16, drunk 3/10/16. Thanks to blisscent!Even after two weeks cold in the fridge, it still manages that signature haziness. Bright flaxen-gold with a large white head that is well-retained.Before even pouring the stuff, a ton of juicy watermelon rises up out of the can. Ok. This is going to be good. Pouring releases mango, lychee, various melon notes and some danker, lightly pine-accented aromatics as well. Malts are reserved to the background, as they should be, leaving only light honey and a touch of cracker. No alcohol or flaws. Watermelon lingering delightfully long.....Juicy, well-attenuated, but still malty enough to balance the hops and add a soft texture. Ultra-tight carbonation and just pure tropical fruit juiciness for days. Very low bitterness, with just a touch of light pine/grapefruit, which actually does help keep the beer on its toes. Lights On, at only 5.6%, achieves much, much more flavor and aroma than most beers in the 7% range, which is quite a feet, while still remaining ridiculously drinkable.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Restrained fruit notes up front, grainy pale malt then comes through and the finish has some mild peppery bittering notes. Decent.","Washington, USA","bvc"
4030,"2015-10-25",4.1,"Fully hazed luminous orange color, retaining a thin layer of white. Pungent aroma featuring unripe mango, guava, white grape, and a funky pairing of cattiness and hazy, cheesy mist. Gravelly, damp, out there. Rough edges of grainy grit are revealed, harmlessly, with some warmth. Outrageous guava flavor and super lean malts; Sauvignon Blanc as much as pale ale. Gorgeous tropical fruits, their skins and cores, lower on citrus, mystifying. Bitter cracked seeds briefly with some dirtiness. Soft and crystal clear palate, buoyant acidity. The pristine and primal fruit presentation of the early flavor does fade somewhat as the air sets in, but this is another inspiring, forward-thinking entry.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

4030,"2015-10-12",3.7,"Basically the 3 types of ale I bought on a recent trip to the brewery are Julius, the fresh hopped flagship of this brewery; Haze, the higher ABV version and Lights on, a somewhat milder and lighter version. They all look the same, have the same aroma, and taste pretty similar. It is another opaque orange colored wet hop bomb, but not as overwhelming as its big brothers. You do get that same fresh-hopped grassy flavor across all three. An unusual and new beer style for me that just blows me away.","Massachusetts, USA","migwell"
