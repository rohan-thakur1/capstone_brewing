4195,"2008-05-10",3.6,"On tap at the brewpub on 5/4/08: Transparent dark copper amber with a nicely-lacing frothy tan head.  Aroma of sweet caramely German malt and some mild noble hops.  Starts with decent fullness and sweet caramel maltiness with a good bittering hop balance before a smooth bittersweet finish with a touch of doughy yeast.  A nice bock.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
4195,"2008-04-06",3.4,"Full bodied with a slightly nutty and biscuity nose.  I found this to be extremely smooth and well balanced.  A bit of caramel sweetness follows throughout every taste.  Slightly dry and fruity in the finish.","Gulf Shores, Alabama, USA","BlackDonald"

4195,"2007-03-26",3.2,"Pours a deep mahogany brown color with a tan head.  Aroma is very light.  It is of caramel and bitter roasted malts.  Flavor is very malty with  bitter roasted malts.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","shp555"
4195,"2007-02-25",4.5,"A delicious bock whose dark red-brown color is exceptionally inviting. The smell is not strong, but I dont have an exceptional sniffer. Flavor is strong and hoppy, but not too bitter, with a little nutty undertone. This beer is smooth and tingly, and definitely worth more than a few sips. If ever you are in Atlanta during the spring and this is on tap, do ask for it!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
4195,"2006-03-29",3.5,"Draft @ the 5.  Poured a clear dark copper color with a thin beige head.  The aroma was light but mostly fruity.  Plums seemed to dominate the aroma.  Malty flavor with some more fruit.  The finish was semi-dry with a bitter hop finish.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
4195,"2006-02-12",3.4,"nice brown body with a thick head and Solid feel to it.  This was so full and rich.  Nice chocolate tones and a hint of nuttiness in the foreground.  it feels so good when it hits your lips.  lol.  no seriously, excellent beer.","Marietta, Ohio, USA","LilKem"
4195,"2006-02-05",3.4,"kind of had a brown tint to it. very nice malt thing going on in the body. Very thick and full. Solid brew.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"

4195,"2005-03-14",3.5,"Wow--very nice malt complexity--nuttiness, roast, plus sweetness.  Aroma typical bockish.  Little bitterness but the finish is not cloying.","Pennsylvania, USA","Probiere"
4195,"2005-03-13",3.1,"Pours dark amber to brown with a decent tan head.  Aromas of roasted malt.  Maltiness does not come through in the flavor at all like expected for a Bock beer.  Very dry for a bock.  Roasty, nutty flavor is also not expected for this style.  Almost like they crossed a Bock and a Nut Brown ale.  All this said, still a nice tasting beer.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","RateandPillage"
4195,"2005-03-07",3.2,"amber colored, with a malty sweet taste, this is a nice rendition of a bock.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
4195,"2005-03-07",3.6,"Deep amber color with a good head.
Malt aroma leading in to a malt flavor profile that is well balanced and smooth. 
Not an over the top Bock, but no real problems here and I wouldnt hesitate to drink another one.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"
4195,"2004-06-19",2.9,"Not much in the way of aroma.  Too much roastiness in the body for what I was expecting.  An o.k. brew but nithing great.","Acworth, Georgia, USA","belgianhomebrew"
4195,"2004-04-07",3.5,"Dark amber with tan head & lacing. The aroma is malty and smooth with some fruit & spice. Full bodied rich flavor with creamy light fruit and malt notes. Finishes dry & refreshing.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
4195,"2004-03-20",4.0,"Dark brown dense appearance with ruby red highlights. The small head died down quickly and latent carbonation was very low. Aroma is floral hops and caramel malts. The amount of hops in the beer when it was cool surprised me a bit. The hops lend this beer a spicy mellow character. As the beer warmed, the sweet caramel malts started coming through quite a bit more. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, and the body feels a bit watered down. Drinkability is very good.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
4195,"2004-02-27",2.8,"apparently as the Pub Crawl went on, my descriptions of beer became more vague so please forgive me.  anyway, this beer was dark red with a malty flavor and bitter aftertaste.","Asheville, North Carolina, USA","scoobyluv"
4195,"2004-02-22",3.9,"Lots o' malt in this one.  Very dark pour with a frothy tan head that was pretty well lasting.  Lots of chewy caramel flavors are present.  A good beer","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","biermonk"
4195,"2004-02-22",3.5,"Not sure what kind of glass this was.  Sweet malt goodness.  Deep brown body and no head.  Nice bock malt and hop bite.  Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.  The bottom line is: a great bock, but its just not my style.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"
4195,"2004-02-22",3.7,"Drank this one on the fly as it was time to leave the 5 Seasons as the first stop in the pub crawl. Dark appearance. Flavor is very malty with some sweet fruit and chocolate in the there. A very nice bock.","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
4195,"2004-02-22",3.8,"Poured dark brown with an offwhite head. It does go down smooth and I think this one bit me in the ass later on. Good maltiness and an all round good beer.","Nolanville, USA","MrRomero"
4195,"2004-02-21",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 21, 2004 A Classic bock, quite complete.  A Dark Reddish Brown color, with moderate, yet fullfy head.  Malty without seeming to be like food.  Went down smooth with constant taste from start to finish.  Not complex - just good.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","skaughty"
4195,"2003-02-03",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2003 Quite possibly the best thing I had here this time around. Nice black but far from opaque body (red hues). Large frothy head is just a little darker than off-white. Nice chewy malt leans heavily toward the chocolate end of the spectrum. Tasty but surprisingly drinkable beer.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
