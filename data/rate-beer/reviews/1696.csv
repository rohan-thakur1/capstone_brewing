1696,"2013-01-10",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2013 Bottle. Probably my favorite weizen in Japan, actually all of Fujizakuras beers are very well made. It has a nice aroma with hints of grass & spice. It poured with a nice head of white foam over a milky gold effervescent body. The foam left a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The flavor is a great balance between spicy & fruity.

1696,"2011-09-25",3.0,"Draught @ Bakushu Club Popeye, Tokyo. Rated on 05.09.2011
Looks like basic weizen. Aroma has sweetish banana, something stale and wheat notes. Palate is surprisingly low on CO2. Flavour is slightly sour, and somewhat weird. It has hints of solvent and no banana whatsoever. One weird weizen and not really nice. Might have been a bad keg now that Ive seen other ratings.","Tampere, FINLAND","laiti"
1696,"2011-01-21",3.8,"500 ml. sample bottle, poured to my 10 oz. tasting glass with a very clear, light golden hue, effervescent, rising bubbles, abundant, white bubbles and froth head foam, that slowly reduced to a persistent 1/2 inch layer, and wavy lacing. The aroma was light wheat and yeast, some candy sweetness, banana, hints of background spice as clove, and some complimentary bubblegum hints. The flavor added lively carbonation and light hop bitterness in a light bodied, but crisp and exceptionally sessionable brew. I was very impresssed by the light but very flavorful aspects, but also by the longevity of quality since first cellared back in April.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

1696,"2009-06-15",3.7,"Mondial 2009.  THanks to Dany for the reccomendation.  Solid Hefe.  Pours a nice very light golden- hazy and a nice foamy soapy head.  Aroma is phenolic, light soap, lemon zest, peppery, modest clove- ok fruity esters, banana, and doughy wheat.  Flavor is spritzy with lemon, lime hints, toasted malts, wheat, dough, phenolic spices, and good fruity esters banana- clove hints of vanilla, but seems a bit on the thin side as it warms up and the yeast itself doens tplay as much of a role in the body.  Pretty solid though and very well made.  Nice stuff.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
1696,"2009-06-15",4.4,"In short: My greatest most best favourite hefeweizen?  Probably.
How: From the bottle at Montreal Mondial de la Bière 2009 (many samples)
The look: Cloudy yellow body topped by a medium off-white head
In long: The intriguing nose mixes banana cake, lemon and a really nice wilderness (almost Saison-like wild).  Fantastic cushiony body.  A lot of wheat, a big fluffy cake, a wild character that sneaks in, good astringency without being acidic, very big body without apparent malt sweetness, leafy and grassy hops dry out the beer with very little bitterness.  Of course not the most tasty beer (its an hefe after-all) but there are very few beers I would like to drink in larger quantities than this one.  I went back many times to get more samples.  In a beer festival (Mondial de la Bière 2009) with all my favourite styles well represented I really didnt expect a hefeweizen come out as my #1 beer of the festival.  Nor did I expect to come out sober enough to stand on my feet.  I was surprised once.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The smell is fantastic citrus with yeast,  for me the smell of sausage was undeniable. Amazing nose! The taste is first a bit light and citrusy before moving to a long aftertaste of delicious wheat and yeast.  It fills the whole palate with a light fizz.

1696,"2007-09-20",3.7,"@ GJBF 2007.  Aroma of bananas, sugary malts, wheat, yeast, grass.  Flavor of spicy cloves, banana, fruits, sweet malt, some wheat, and I swear there is some vanilla in there, but it seemed fleeting.  I could go for a few more of these.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
1696,"2007-08-01",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Heavenly bananas top the angelfood cake, as doughy yeast is succulently emboldened into a whipped cream in this world-class Hefeweizen. Vanilla ice cream surfs the soft bubbling, and drinkability and nourishment are amazingly joined.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-An everlasting head of foam protects the cloudy, shiny blond golden.
-The nose and mouthfeel are supremely expressive and laid back at once.
-The soft bubbling lets the expertly extracted maltiness express itself.
-This one was the winner of a Hefeweizen face-off we did at Popeyes, against two other very tasty examples of the style in Hidatakayama Weizen and Hakusekikan Niwa-Weiss.

On tap at the brewery restaurant and at Popeyes.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

Clove > banana > German hops.  Hazy yellow wth a dense flanel blanket.  Very mild sweet malt in good balance with fermentation phenolic, though a bit weak.  Bubblegumy esters in the finish.
