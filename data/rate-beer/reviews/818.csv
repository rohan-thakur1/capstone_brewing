818,"2013-10-16",3.0,"750mL from Brouwers cafe in Seattle. Clear, sparkling straw with massive white foam. Ridiculous volcanic lacing. A bit overcarbonated. Celery like nose with lemon, pear, cidery esters. Taste is extremely dry, mild alcohol bite, celery bite, long grassy bitterness. Huge carbonation. A good Lager attempt, but needs work. Less Alcohol to start. Yeast character being estery is off for Lager styles.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
818,"2013-05-07",3.9,"Huge thanks to FalconA for hooking me up with this huge want of mine. 750 ml into a pint glass. Suppose this is from 2010.

A - Pours a hazy pale amber body. Tons of rising carbonation and and a billowing mass of white foam that overflows and has peaks to it. Takes quite a bit of time and effort to get a full pour. For a 3 year old beer this is pretty damn active.

S - The aroma is almost like a hefe. Cut grass, cereal grains, some sweet cracker malts, and lemons. It is pretty fruity and herbal and actually pretty complex. There is something a bit off and unpleasant towards the finish.  I understand that it was a pretty hoppy beer to begin with but that is all but faded now.

T - Follows the nose with cereal grains, lemons juice, and some spice. There is a bit of oxidation in the beer present in the form of a malt like sweetness with a bit of cardboard. It currently compliments the beer, but you can tell that this beer has nowhere to go but downhill. Very reminiscent of Dogfish Heads Golden Shower with age only with considerably less abv and intensity. Its actually pretty tasty. Creamy mouth feel but it feels like its missing some carbonation.

O - Beer wise it has held up considerably well. Ive only had one other aged imperial pilsner/lager and this is right there along side it. It works, its just obvious that the hops have faded and some oxidation is beginning to settle in. Oh, and the label. As a die hard Clash fan Im pretty much in love.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

There was definitely a career opportunity waiting to be made in brewing saisons for an audience so bored of the USA over-the-top IPAs and such. Upright capitalized; on this coast, theyre the leader, brewing Oregon subtly intstead of Washington bullets. For me, its the right profile. 

In the supermarket, I stumbled across this beer, turned it over and over, and couldnt figure out what it was; ""Whats my name?"" it practically screams; heck, Id even like a clue as to the style. Though I tempted to be a cheapskate, Uprights reputation carried the day here; one more time  Pours straw-yellow with an explosive white riot of whipped eggwhite head. Peppery, lemon, definite saison tones, though relatively subtle--Im not overpowered by funk. Im not down with the sticky imperial-pilsner feel, but I cant deny it, this is a good beer and its sure to land atop the premium lager category, even though I think its a bit of cheat to push that to 6.7%.

It definitely wants to be free like a butterfly--the mildest pour mounds it up and up. Nice white pepper notes on the nose. You go in suspecting saison overtones, you go in hearing about saison overtones, you get there and there are saison overtones. Orange peel, too. There go those saison overtones again. Fizzy body, just a positive eruption of carbonation down to the last drop. Crisp and light and airy. Lemons, oranges, and white pepper showing. Long peppery finish.

818,"2011-01-07",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2011 In short: A very sharp pilsner style beer that goes off the beaten path.  A strange but very enjoyable session beer.
How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed fresh about one month after purchase.  Bottle sent to me by mcberko, thanks a lot Matt
The look: Mostly clear yellow-blonde body (gets partially cloudy at the end of the bottle) topped by a HUGE white head with good retention leaving lots of lacings on the glass.
In long: Nose is full of yellowed grass, some lemongrass and with some hospital gloves style phenols.  The well malted body is filled with pale pils malts with a dry plain salty crackers taste.  Reminds me of salted Premium Plus crackers.  I got a lot of salt/minerals (borderline metallic) sensation from this beer that just added to the astringency and didnt feel out of place.  Then comes the hops with a strong yellowed grass and citric character.  Very sharp finish that is as citric and dry as it is bitter.  The last 10% of the bottle was quite different from the rest.  The doughy yeast changed everything.  My bottle was stored for two weeks horizontally in a wine cellar but that wasnt good enough.  I recommend turning the bottle upside-down to spread the yeast before opening.  There was some plastic/phenols from start to finish that lowers my overall score but by and large this is a wonderful session beer.  The scores are pretty low for this so obviously I like it much more than most people.  Im probably wrong, I have low self esteem, and thats all my fault..","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
818,"2011-01-06",3.8,"Shibby-dibby-doo. A 750 ml. bottle purchased from Malt and Vine. Its quite carbonated. In fact, Im having to wait quite a while just to imbibe. This has a most excellent aroma. From the description, they say they didnt use brettanomyces, but Im getting a brett-like aroma. It has a wonderfully crisp hop aroma that reminds me of the Duvel Triple-Hop. Wow, this aroma is pungent, and pleasing. This has a diaphanous golden/yellow appearance. Its looking pretty good, as well. Its VERY crisp and effervescent, texture-wise. Its quite different from what you would expect from your everyday pale lager. This has a pleasing hop flavor, with a grassy and dry finish. This does have a light honey flavor to it. Its very good, almost to the point where Id consider this a Saison. Ok, if youre going to consider this a pale lager, then Id say its the best.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

818,"2010-10-28",3.5,"750ml bottle, fairly fresh.  Opening clean, with a loud hiss, the bottle brings forth a downright cloudy, light golden-straw liquid with an absolutely massive, billowing head of off-white froth.  Tall and rocky, that foam takes ages to settle, and never fully goes away.  Twenty minutes go by before its down to a centimeter level.  Of course, tall, raging flares and jagged splotches mark the glass, resembling the waves from Hokusais masterpiece Kanagawa Oki Nami Ura. Its an absolutely beautiful beer, but the first whiff brings worry, as there are initial notes of plastic or bandaid, suggesting infection.  Though it did not gush those telltale signs of something gone afoul are unmistakable.  I walk away for a while to see if it will blow off, and indeed it does.  Having gained some clarity, the nose now reveals its true character, which is a harmonious blend of clean pilsner malt, golden wheat, cream, and peppery, lemony hops.  Wildflowers bring spicy zest and vigor, as fresh spring water and mountain air lend an earthy, mineral-rich contingent.  Nickel offers a sharp metallic element that slices through the softly sweet, doughy yeast.  As more time goes on, the more I am glad I let this one sit.  Flavors ring true, showing just a tiny bit of caramelized pils malt sweetness, with notes of raw bread dough and some lemon meringue.  From the mid point on, biting, zesty, peppery hops take over.  Bitter, bone dry grasses are accompanied by oily citrus rind and some lemon pith.  Distinctly Belgian yeast is both doughy and earthy, hinting at a wide range of elements, from flour crackers to stone and metal.  The palate, much like the flavor, quickly transitions from a very lightly sugared forefront to an absolutely bone dry, desert-like finish.  Scratchy carbonation bounces from roof to tongue and back again, sizzling like a drop of water on a hot pan.  This will be one polarizing brew.  I can see two distinct sets of beer fanatics both loving and hating it.  Me?  I fall somewhere in the middle.  I love the fully attenuated dryness and the play between the lemony hops and the clean pils malts.  I dont like, however, how temperamental the beer is overall, and I do ultimately feel that there is an infection setting in that will ultimately ruin the beer.  As it stands, in the state at which I consumed it, I liked it a good deal. My recommendation, however, is to drink this puppy as soon as you can if you have a bottle, and to allot a good amount of time for it even though the gravity is fairly low.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

A lager ah.. well I didnt know what to make of this one, but anything thats got The  Clash on the label has to have some balls. This one didnt disappoint.
