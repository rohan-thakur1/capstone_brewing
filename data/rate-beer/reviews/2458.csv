2458,"2017-01-29",3.8,"Draft... Pours clear and golden with a large, frothy, white head. Fantastic retention and scattered lacing. The suns features pilsner malt accompanied by spicy and floral hops. Medium to full-bodied with lively carbonation. The flavor features loads of spicy and peppery hop bitterness. Dough and pilsner malt components ride shotgun.Actually, its more like theyre sitting in the back seat. Finishes crisp, moderately bitter and then doughy.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

2458,"2016-10-20",4.1,"Draught at Armsby Abbey, 10/6/16.Good clarity throughout this sparkling, copper-tinted golden beer. White head atop is fluffy and well-retained.Strong herbs, flowers and honey are perceived in the nose. Lemon, lime and orange rind signify that this certainly has an American edge to it (I wasnt sure coming in to it) but thats fine. Little/no resin and lots of zesty, spicy, citrus and other yellow fuits. Honey and biscuit character backs it nicely, with charming house yeast and well water notes. No alcohol or flaws.Very hoppy up front, even more so than Mary, with more fruitiness, lots of citrus and even a hint of tropical fruit. Strong honey-like maltiness is nonetheless well-attenuated and the beer is dry and crisp on the end, with floral, spicy and citric hops lingering. Tight carbonation and no alcohol or flaw noted. Lovely.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2458,"2016-09-24",4.2,"Une Lager signée Shaun Hill, ça na rien dune Lager ordinaire. Je retrouve la Signature de Hill dans chacune des dimensions de cette bière et je ne retrouve justement pas ce qui me déplaît habituellement dune Lager. Il sagit pour moi de la Lager parfaite - si une telle chose existe vraiment. Majestueuse tête flottant sur un liquide à la densité dune Ale. Présence de houblons Vermontois sans quil ne sagisse pour autant dun houblonnage à la manière dune IPA. Très végétal et feuillu. Une touche terreuse cache les arômes de levures à fermentation basse. Bien croustillante et granuleuse, le houblon apporte un parfait équilibre à ces malts croquants. Jai du des brassins de la grand-mère Mary, qui avaient un caractère semblable. Très aromatique, légère, bien effervescente et au corps assez généreux, cette concoction ne pourrait venir dailleurs que de cette fameuse colline.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

Flavor of light cracker, gentle flower petals and a really decent spicy hop. Very clean, similar to HF Mary but hopped differently. Perhaps the same malt bill. Clean, refreshing, simple.

2458,"2015-09-06",4.0,"How: On tap (pint) at Parker Pie.

>>> Clean and easy drinking herbal forward hoppy lager with a nice citrusy hops touch. 

-  Clear golden with a small white head, good retention and heavy lacing. 
-  Its nicely hoppy (citrus, herbal), but not too intense so it doesnt hide the base beer. 
-  The beer is herbal forward along perfumy notes and mild spiciness. 
-  The malt backbone, while never sweet, is providing a solid support to the beer and is really interesting by itself. 
-  Body is medium and the mouthfeel is really fluffy. 
-  The finish is rather dry, but also feature herbal bitterness that lingers quite a bit. 

Flavors:  Herbal, perfumy, hoppy (citrus, herbal notes), mild spiciness, grains.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
2458,"2015-09-05",3.8,"On Draft at Hill Farmstead and later in a growler. Hazy, has a lemon juice like appearance. 1 finger head. Looks really nice. You can certainly smell a lager. Its similar to some of the hoppy offerings from Jacks Abbey (my only frame of reference). I get lemon, american hops, a bit juicy and citrus forward. Taste is similar to aroma but I get this interesting table sugar flavor at the finish. Very juicy, goo mouthful. the lager flavor isnt in your face and isnt detracting.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
2458,"2015-09-01",3.9,"750 ml growler shared by Chris - thanks again, Chris! The tag was marked with ""India Pale Lager,"" which was an unexpected sight for me. Pours a cloudy, pale bright gold with a small white head that settles into a film and ring, leaving a few lace spots in the glass. Notes of straw, husky grains, grass, bright florals, lemon peel, cereal, cracker, and a doughy, yeasty quality. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a mostly clean mouthfeel thats also dry, bitter, and malty. Really nice beer. I wouldnt mind seeing more experimentation in this category from them.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
2458,"2015-08-28",4.2,"750 ml growler filled today at the brewery. Very clear, orange pour with solid white head that isnt quite as vivacious nor long-lasting as most from the brewery, perhaps a function of the lager yeast. Nose is very clean, with hints of grainy husk mixing with a gorgeous hop profile; classic tangerine, white grapefruit, and lemongrass up front, but a big juicy pop of apricot and white plum on the finish. Flavor holds more citrus and stone fruit with an incredibly dry mouthfeel. Quenching and refreshing, but rich in flavor. Damn good.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
