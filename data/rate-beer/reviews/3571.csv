3571,"2016-11-18",3.2,"Bottle from a trade. Nose is very funky, way beyond just lacto. Farmy. Bretty. Not much hop presence. Crystal clear light yellow. Large white head. Dissipates quickly. Taste is less complex, no salt. Ok. Starts to be a touch puckery after a little.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
3571,"2016-09-05",3.8,"One of the better kent falls beers. Murkey hazy pale golden with minimal fizzy head. Aroma is grapefruit, melon, grassy, mineral, lemon, and a touch floral. Taste is tart hoppy and nicely balanced. Good stuff.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"

3571,"2016-07-28",3.9,"Pours deep straw into a tulip. Bright white head with medium retention recedes to skim surface. Heather and summer spice aromas. Sour rhubarb with salty robber upfront turning to mild meringue in the abrupt finish. Interesting.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"

Pours very hazy blond with no serious head. Aroma is of citrus, spices, nice yeast. Taste is of salt, citrus, yuzu, sourness, acidity, spices. Palate: Medium body, soft carbonation. Overall: Quite nice.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","Minderbinder"
3571,"2016-02-10",3.7,"On tap at The Tip Tap Room. Pours a really hazy golden with a really small white rim that leaves some lacing. Nose is of dilly hops (Sorachi?) and yogurt. A moderately high tartness leads into some lemony flavors along with cereals and a light saltiness. Body is light, carbonation medium-high and it is super refreshing and clean. A nice gose, way better than the Relic swill we had just before!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
3571,"2016-02-08",3.6,"500 mL bottle. Hazy pale yellow. Smells of tropical hops, wheat, and lemon acidity. Taste is quite tart. Tropical fruits. Lemon and lime. Wheat and a barely salty finish. Light, but strong on the sourness. Refreshing. Maybe a little too sour for what else it has going for it, though.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

3571,"2015-12-17",4.0,"On tap at Mikro, 12 oz tulip. Kent Falls does it again. Totally redeemed after the crazy/weird/bad Gardeners Tale, Alternate World is like a re-awakening. Cloudy straw color, little to no head, low carbonation. Nose leaves a little to be desired but the sour, funky, fruity hay taste makes up for that in spades. I want to say its almost a little hoppy, but honestly, its hard to pin the flavor down. Its definitely worth the buy. Its crazy good.","Hamden, Connecticut, USA","boofcheese"
3571,"2015-11-16",4.0,"A hazed golden ale with a thin white head. In aroma, sweet fruity malt with light lemon notes, light Brett, light lactic notes, very nice. In mouth, beautiful tart apples, light Brett , loads of lemon acidity, light chalky notes, light berries, very complex and beautiful. On tap at Ginger Man NYC.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
3571,"2015-10-24",3.9,"500ml bottle in a tulip. Pours cloudy golden with a white head. Aroma of sourness, fruity and floral hops, light malts and wheat, and some salt. Flavor the same with a nice blend. Average texture. Finally impressed by a Kent Falls beer - glad it finally happened.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
3571,"2015-10-23",4.0,"Nice floral citrus dry hop aroma with some lactic sour of the gose. Taste is a nice dry bitter hop finish with a lactic sour gose backing. Maybe a slight salty from the gose. Descent amount of sour for a gose, maybe 3 of 10 sour, less than Westbrook but more than most. I wouldnt pick it out as a gose if I didnt know. Like a dry hopped sour with some slightly peppery saison qualities. Different and unique beer, but quite nice.  The hops and the sour give it a big, juicy grapefruit like feel, or at least a big juicy hop feel. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone","East Greenbush, New York, USA","Mep3222"
3571,"2015-09-17",3.8,"Keg at Owl Farm. It pours cloudy light gold with a thick white head. The nose is fresh, earth, lemon zest, lime, bread, cracker and minerals. The taste is crisp, bitter, tart, minerals, light saltiness, good mouth-pucker, lemon, limeade and grapefruit with a dry finish. Medium body and fine carbonation. Crisp, tart and crushable. Great balance. Very nice gose.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
3571,"2015-09-17",3.6,"Hazy orange pour with thin off white head.

Light body. Tart, lemony throughout. Slighty oily finish.

Out of balance but tastes pretty good.Very very lemony","New York, New York, USA","mrmartin"
3571,"2015-08-29",3.9,"On draft as a guest tap at Cambridge House after their darned fine Kölsch. Pour was a hazy cloudy straw golden color with a weak but typical for the style head. Aroma of lemon heads candies, tart wheat grains. Flavor was tart dish detergent lemon, wheaty bready malt base. Tropical fruits do indeed complement every aspect of this beer, slight saltiness, yet citrusy lemons are the forefront through and through. Mouthfeel had some serious body, maybe the biggest bodied gose Ive experienced, and you know it is a style Ive probably conquered the world over. Fun indeed, lingering acidic and oily finish. A very fun beer. No doubt.","","User37895"
3571,"2015-08-13",4.0,"Draught at Publick House, 8/12/15.Much like the Medusa Fermette I just had, this bright tangerine-copper beer is moderately hazy and topped by a white head that steadily recedes to cover.Big juiciness in the nose emanates from both citrusy hop and brett notes. Soft lactic acids pretty well integrated and theres just enough graham cracker-like malt notes to add a little grain character. Not overly salty or intensely lemony, and with warming, varied tropical notes continue to emerge; kiwi, mango and pineapple. No alcohol or flaws.Lovely blend of citrusy hops and juicy, tart tropical fruit flavors from both brett and hop. Tight, ample carbonation helps distribute it about the palate and theres a lip smacking, oily, lactic acidity on the finish. Dry, but amply malted and while I think I caught a taste of diacetyl at one point, it was very minor. Really enjoyable. Tart, fruity and acidic without being obnoxiously so. These guys are really hittin their stride.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
