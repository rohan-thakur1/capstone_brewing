1812,"2015-04-09",3.5,"Bottle and served in tulip: The initial pour was very pretty but alas the head died too quickly. The nose has lots of liquorice, some vanilla, oak, smoke and faint coffee. The java character is more present on the palate but the malt tones are still dominate and the barrel notes add a layer of complexity but this screams for a bit more noble hop bitterness. Some dark chocolate and still more anise tones. Smooth and sticky but not overly heavy mouthfeel, for a coffee imbued and barrel aged beer it is damn solid palate. Overall, I really like parts of this brew but am left wanting sharper bitters and more lasting carbonation. Good to try once... Liked the Vanilla Bean version more.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Shared by a passer-by for a chance to hang around the campfire wed built. The pour is a really dark black with a small white head. I was expecting a darker head for a Baltic, but it let me down a touch. The aroma has a lot of alcohol up front. Behind that lies the coffee, lots of licorice, some hints of vanilla and toffee. The flavor is very similar. There is a bit more of a roasted malt in the flavor than the nose led on. The back end tails off into something much more bitter. Lots of coffee ad dark chocolate. The mouth feel is oily, yet slick. The carbonation is soft, but it disappears quickly. The aftertaste is lingeringly bitter and roasty. Nice Baltic Porter","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

1812,"2014-07-15",4.1,"I brought the whole 2012 set to our monthly tasting.


A - Pours pitch black with a nice one finger tall tan head, slowly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small streaks of lace down the sides of the glass.


S - Smells of strong coffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, coconut, chocolate and smokey dark malt. The coffee is quite strong while still being balanced with the other aromas, very nice work.


T - Starts off with the strong fresh brewed coffee slowly being joined by some mild sweetness, - mainly the chocolate and vanilla - toasted coconut, smoked malt and warming woody bourbon. Finish is pretty roasty with some mild sweetness, lingering long after the finish. Not as well balanced as the nose but still really nice.


M - Heavy body with moderate carbonation. Smooth, roasty feel with some nice sweetness to even it all out. A bit of tannins and very light booze dry the palate at the end of each sip.


O - This was probably my favorite of the three, just barely beating out the vanilla. The coffee really accentuated the base flavors and yet it remained easy to consume. Glad I could try this one and share it with everyone.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

Medium to full-bodied with tingly carbonation. The flavor is an acrid, roasty blend of charcoal, red-hot bourbon and dark-roast mocha. Finishes acrid and boozy. Bottle courtesy of landhoney!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1812,"2014-04-29",3.9,"50cl bottle sampled side by side with the Vanilla version. Pours an oily, opaque black with some cloudy, white head. Nose has a lot of coffee, bright coffee grounds, nutty, caramel, mild licorice. Flavor is the same, coffee, caramel, licorice, a fair amount of smoke.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
1812,"2014-04-27",4.3,"Bottle. Brown-black pour with a nice off-white head. Aroma is deep espresso and milk chocolate. I also find layers of butter and cream that makes it exquisite. Taste is roasted malts, coffee and cream. So rich without being cloying and overly sweet, oats adds a nice creamy touch. Extremely well balanced imperial stout. The most intense (and best) oat stout Ive had.","Quebec, CANADA","Luk_"
1812,"2014-04-27",3.9,"At Jacobs with group. Pour is black with a circle of white head. Aroma is pungent lightly roasted malt, smooth vanilla marshmallow notes. Taste is drinkable medium body roasted malt. Incredibly smooth, would pound all day. Could drink on a hot day, easy. Interesting for a drinkable beer.","Dallas, Texas, USA","Experiment_Ale"
1812,"2014-04-21",3.8,"Nice dark brown pour, very small head. Flavor is loaded with coffee, light hints of ash, barrel, toasted oak, bourbon, roast and a dry bitter finish.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
1812,"2014-03-26",3.7,"Bottle from trade. Pours milky black with nice tall tan head. Coffee aroma is great, some nutmeg and vanilla as well. Taste is big punch of coffee, some vanilla notes. Quite sweet. The alcohol is well hidden here. Great porter.","Wake Forest, North Carolina, USA","jdb288"
1812,"2014-03-25",4.0,"Bottle with thanks to Reynolds314! Pours opaque black with a nice small creamy tan head that dissipates slowly and laces well. Aroma is not overpowering, notes of coffee, roasted malts, a bit of ashtray, some bourbon. Flavor is boozier than the nose - bourbon prominent, some oak, nice chocolate and roasty coffee notes as well. Light to medium sweetness, medium bitterness and some acidity from the coffee as well the time in wood. Full, creamy body. A bit hot due to ABV. Gets a bit bitter with time as you drink it.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"

1812,"2014-03-11",3.4,"Fresh bottle, drunk 3/9/14Small tan head diminishes fairly rapidly, leaving a dark brown body, with deep garnet highlights.Thankfully far less bourbon in the nose than the Vanilla version showed. Still there, of course, but its not a mess of coconut and pineapple and actually allows the beer to break through. Raisins, black licorice and light chocolate with barrel notes providing vanilla, light buttercream and some sharper alcohol dryness. Probably the lightest thing in the nose is the coffee, which is limited to very light roast, dry, crunchy coffee grinds and more vanilla. No deep espresso or thick, juicy cold-pressed beans here.Light bourbon and rather dry, tannic wood notes lead the sweet caramel-vanilla maltiness while a touch of raisins and prunes give way to light coffee but no where near the amount of barrel character and vanilla that that version showed. Still, its fairly sweet, a little low on carbonation and somewhat simplistic.Slowly slogging my way through these massive Jacks Abby beers. This one is certainly better than the vanilla bottle I had and I fully expect the barrel-aged version to top that and the regular framinghammer to, in turn, top that. We shall see.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1812,"2014-03-09",4.3,"500ml bottle thanks to NHhophead! Pours dark almost opaque brown with 2 finger mocha head. Nose is rich earthy roasty coffee, cream, balanced fruity bourbon.

Fantastic.","Hampton Roads, Virginia, USA","JBPortland"
1812,"2014-03-07",4.1,"Bottle at home with friends. Pour is deep brown with a frothy tan head and good lacing. Coffee, green pepper, roasty, light cocoa, caramel, pie crust, burnt toffee, and toast in the aroma. Taste is rich earthy coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, bread, somewhat grassy, vanilla, pie crust, and marshmallows with a smooth roasted finish. Slick mouthfeel with soft carbonation.

1812,"2014-03-01",4.0,"Pours deep mahogany into a snifter. Mocha micro head with good retention recedes to hug rim. Chocolate and coffee aromas. Medium bodied with soy and coffee front to back. Lasting, dry and slightly sour licorice finish","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
1812,"2014-02-16",4.1,"2014 batch, 500 ml into a snifter. Pours a deep black body with two fingers of tan foam. Decent lacing. Aroma is light roasted coffee, chocolate, and some caramel malt. Almost fudgey. Taste is light coffee and chocolate washed away by bright chocolate and caramel malt. Some residual sugars and coffee bitterness/dryness on the finish but it drinks rather light given the high abv. Just a notion of oak and vanilla on the finish but this isnt very barrel heavy at all. Creamy medium bodied mouth feel. This is very drinkable and delicious. Of course its easy to draw parallells to a stout so if youre expecting a BCBCS then youll be let down. This is lighter and creamier and a really fantastic beer.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"
1812,"2014-02-13",4.0,"Dark brown, moderate beige head. Sticky caramel, coffee roast, milk chocolate, creme, light bourbon, traces of vanilla. Bittersweet rounded out with an unexpected wood flavor. A little more than medium-bodied but not by much. Finishes on a somewhat herbal note with a little booziness.","California, USA","Ataraxia"
1812,"2014-02-07",3.9,"Draft at the source. Pours black coffe brown with a beige head that fades to a thin coating and rims the glass. Aroma is coffee, vanilla, caramel malt. Less sweet than the Vanilla, the coffee is nice, giving this more balance. Undertone is still caramel, fig, soy, but the sweetness is balanced by a nice moderate coffee bitterness.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
1812,"2014-02-05",4.1,"500ml bottle in a teku. Pours black with a lacy, beige head. Aroma of coffee, roasted malts, some chocolate, some bourbon and oak, some dough, and hints of vanilla.

1812,"2014-02-04",4.3,"Slightly better then the vanilla but both are great. The coffee is roasty and very nice without being overpowering to the rest of the beer. The bourbon provides vanilla light boozyness and an oaky spicy back end. Great beer.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"

1812,"2013-10-27",4.3,"Pours a deep burnt umber with a finger of khaki foam. Lots of earthy coffee on the nose with traces of roasted chocolate malt and some bourbon too. The palate follows with alot more bourbon presence adding a nice heat and spice that balances the coffee nicely with a heavy chocolate roast backbone and a lingering bitter coffee finish. Really dialed in and well made beer !","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
1812,"2013-10-06",4.1,"Bottle, thanks Jao for an awesome night of ticks! Black-dark brown pour with off-white head. Aroma of cold pressed coffee, tons and tons of it, light roasty notes, a bit vegetal (like Kopi or cold brew). Taste is quite bitter, coffee, vanilla, very smooth flavor compared to the aroma that was a bit harsh. Palate is creamy, soft carbonation. Delicious.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
1812,"2013-09-02",3.8,"500 ml bottle shared by bsuedekum- thanks again, Blake! Looks just like the other two variants- deep coffee brown, not opaque, smallish beige head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, earth, nuts, oak, and toasted sugar. The flavor is a lighter version of the same. Toasty finish. Light-medium bodied, with a sweet, dry, malty mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. A little thinner than Id want. About even with the Vanilla Bean version.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

1812,"2013-06-04",4.1,"Thank you Chris for grabbing a bottle of each of these for me at the release. You rock man! 2 finger sticky, creamy leathery head. Pours almost black into the glass. Very much a porter appearance. Nose is creamy steamed milk latte with roasted cherries. Mind-blowingly big coffee taste. Like pouring myself an espresso, adding some milk and sugar and chugging. Great roasted notes finish, no burn, very drinkable. Loving the fact it tastes just like drinking a  carbonated espresso.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
1812,"2013-05-29",4.1,"Sampled at the Game 7 Hawks-Wings tasting. Pours black in color with some brown hues around the edges. Nose is packed with delicious coffee. Much better than coffee smoke and dagger. Flavor is similarly coffee forward with some backing barrel character. Some drying oak and just a hung of bourbon. Light mouthfeel, good carbonation, some sweetness, and a moderate finish. Absolutely awesome, one of my favorite Jacks Abbys to date, probably my favorite non-hoppy lager.","Illinois, USA","Dunt"
1812,"2013-05-27",3.9,"I picked up all three barrel aged variations at Julios Liquors on 4 May 2013 for the special release. I am now comparing Side- by Side- by- Side. Insanely dark pour with thin tan head. Massive retention.  Wonderful aromas of bourbon, wet oak, chocolate and burnt malt. The coffee is a nice addition, yet it seems to dominate all the other flavors. The barrel notes and bourbon are almost not even noticeable.  Lingering espresso bean notes. Mouthfeel is on the medium side. Dont get me wrong, I love this brew and if you know somebody who went to Julios or the special brewery release, by all mean try this. It is a wonderful coffee brew that any coffee beer lover will enjoy. I like it, I just think the vanilla bean was a bit better. But Im splitting hairs here. Still a fine brew.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
