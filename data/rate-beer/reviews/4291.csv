4291,"2015-10-08",3.1,"Draft to taster. Looks solid; a transparent deeper (borderline orangish) gold with white head that steadily dissipates into lacing. Smells solid too; smells of mild caramel and lager yeast. Tastes like it smells, but with more toffee than caramel. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied. Not bad, but forgettable.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
4291,"2015-10-04",3.5,"Draft to taster at Dutchs. Pours a clear golden color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have pale, lightly toasted bready malts, mild fruitiness, very light bitterness, decent beer for what it is, but not overly complex, I would try it again just for comparison sake.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"

Medium-plus body. Smooth, kind of soft, mildly effervescent light carbonation. Mild slick finish. Moderate sweet taste, lighter bitter. Solid bigger dortmunder. Satisfying. Nice to enjoy with my smoked chicken sandwich.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
