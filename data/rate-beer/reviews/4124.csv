4124,"2016-05-17",5.0,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2017 Tap @ CBC2016. Pours a deep dark purple, almost black. Oily, no bubbles, straight up slick stuff. Aromas of currants, sweet berries, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, subtle vanilla, sweet honey, icecream-like stuff, tannins. Taste is a huge bomb of fruits, icecream, vanilla, white chocolate, tannins, subtle tartness in the back. The sort of sometimes overwhelming honey sweetness is completely gone, and even though this is very sweet theres a huge balance from the subtle tartness, the fruity sweetness and the additional barrel sweetness. Incredible in every way. First 5 Ive ever given on ratebeer but I cant see how this shouldnt get a 5. Cant say I prefer this over the best beers Ive ever had, but for what it is, I cant see how this could be any better.","Aarhus N, DENMARK","Klimaet"

4124,"2015-09-14",4.1,"Pour at berry white day, this one has the most complexity of all the berry whites for sure, but it loosing a little of the charm of each of the components. The blackberry adds murkyness to the overall flavors. The white chocolate is still there, The strawberry and blueberry play off each other nicely. I think this can get fine tuned into something very unique, perhaps 4 parts strawberry: 2 blueberry, 1: blackberry ? IT would be fun to play with this one.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
