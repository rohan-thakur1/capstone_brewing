854,"2016-12-17",4.0,"Fantastically well balanced light sake. If you told me this was 8 or 9% alc. I would believe you. Melon fruit, lychee, musk, orange rind, green apples, semi dry finish. Rich. I have had better Daiginjos but aside from that sub style this is about as good as I have had.","JAPAN","jonno"
854,"2016-06-03",3.8,"Large format bottle pour into wine glass taster at Asano, Umeda, Osaka. Shared with biggirlpanties and KyotoLefty. Metallic blue calligraphy on white label, green glass. New bottle design or perhaps this is the Japanese bottle design.Clear water pour as expected, big legs. Softer aroma with moderate flowers and herbs. Taste begins hot, moves to spices and herbs. Mouthfeel is medium body but silky. Quick finish, no warming alcohol lingers. Definitely solid, but I much preferred the other sakes from this shuzouten.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
854,"2016-05-08",3.8,"Pours to a glassy yellow tinted body. Flavors are quite strong... in fact very forward. Cantaloupe and honeydew melon with a light starfruit. Aroma has minerality and melon. Medium body.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
854,"2014-11-16",3.6,"Bottle shared with my wife. Pours a clear yellow. Melon with a touch of banana and strawberries on the nose, warm rice. Medium bodied, big alcohol hits right away, warming and spicy. Rice on the finish, more fruity banana and yeast, then more warming lingering alcohol.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
854,"2014-06-24",3.8,"Bottle shared with Andrew and Brendan courtesy of Andrew, thanks Ellen. Pours a clear body with faint cloudy color and no lacing or bubbles. Aroma is full of fruits - strawberries, melon and peach, in addition to some floral tones and light alcohol character. Mouthfeel is a touch boozy upfront with notes of strawberry and peach following. Additional flavors include light flowers, grass, sweet rice wine and light fruity yeast.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
854,"2013-12-15",3.9,"720 ml bottle. Limited release nama version. fruity, slightly dusty ginjoka nose. Pears, apples, light banana. Clear, slightly icy and oily. Fruity fruity and rich. Melon, peach, light banana, pear. Drying alcohol heat in the finish balances the moderate sweetness. Full and smooth, though not heavy at all. Very nice. Interesting, dry, ethereal flavors coming out as well. Cant put my finger on it, but very original.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
854,"2013-05-06",3.4,"Bottle at Zenkichi in Brooklyn, 05/05/2013. Light, off-clear pour. Aroma is rice, peach and strawberry as advertised, sweet clean finish. Taste is clean rice, light fruity tanginess, touch of sour, sake yeast. Medium light palate, smooth finish. Nice, straightforward.","New York, USA","jbeatty"
854,"2013-02-06",4.7,"Incredible and still reasonable, tastes incredibly similar to the highly award winning/transcendental life changing batch of Dassai 23;

Its got a little more after burn, strong hints of pineapple, Delicious, ambrosia is incredible.  A+","North Carolina, USA","asg123"
854,"2011-05-22",4.0,"Pours clear and still with some nice legs on the glass.  Smells of rice, strawberries, some fruity hints, touches of honey.  Tastes sweet/dry with some nice fruity undertones and a hint of pears on the finish.  Enjoyable.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
854,"2011-01-17",3.5,"Bottle. Asian pear, white pepper, floral notes, and a very faint lactic or yogurty edge on the nose. Very light gold. Mostly dry, with juniper and herbal notes; it reminded me of gin at the front of the palate. Finish dries quickly and cleanly. Would make a great aperitif.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"
854,"2010-09-22",4.0,"300 ml bottle at Sake Gura.  Pour is still clear slight viscous- has some legs in the small glass.  Aroma is lots of peaches, grass, and lots of rose petals, light white grape must, and hints of strawberries.  Strawberry in the flavor comes out more than the aroma- especially when warm and blends well with the peach tones to create a peach/strawberry ice cream that I get at the sushi place near my work.  Finish is lightly sweet, floral, light rice winey- slight solvent, alcohol is hidden well in the thickness, but still dries out nicely in the end.  Very awesome Daiginjo and for $25 for 300ml at a high end restaurant seemed like a very good price for the quality.  Great stuff!  One of my new favorite Daiginjos.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
854,"2010-03-31",4.0,"Cellars Sake Seminar.  Clear color.  Great aroma of bananas and honey.  Big, floral taste.  The flavor of the rice really shines through.  Slightly sweet.  Yum.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
854,"2010-01-07",4.1,"Bottle at toncatchers 2.  Bottle from dasilky1.  Thanks!  Smells like flowers, wax lips, lightly sweet.  No alcohol burn for 16.5%. Very easy to drink.  Excellent.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"
854,"2009-12-26",3.8,"(720 ml bottle via trade with BMan1113VR, thanks Andrew!) Served lightly chilled. Pours light, pale yellow, appears mostly clear but perhaps has a very slight haze. Some very light bubbly effervescence appears briefly. Aroma of strawberry, peach and apricot. The aroma is kind of gentle and somehow not sweet or syrupy despite the fruit notes. Mouthfeel is light but has a nice yeasty fullness. Flavor of fruit - strawberry, peach and apricot. ABV is fairly well-covered, at least relative to other sakes Ive had. But this stuff packs quite a punch - wow! As it warms the fruit becomes a little more grapey, and a little more yeasty warmth emerges. Look forward to trying more of this style to compare.","Boothbay, Maine, USA","porterhouse"
854,"2009-09-11",3.0,"Not water-colored like many of the sakes Ive had; a bit off-yellow.  Distinctly sweet aroma of anise and exotic fruit, with more common fruits in the flavor, especially the melons.  Tart yet sweet.  Restrained alcohol.  I didnt particularly enjoy this, actually.  I had this on the patio at W.A. Frosts, St. Paul, MN.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
854,"2009-06-23",4.0,"Pewter yellow clear with some legs.  The aroma is of melon and grape, white chocolate.  The flavor is much the same, a bit dry, with a slightly sea like quality.  Overall, quite nice.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"

854,"2009-05-30",4.0,"Slightly yellow stained clear and still liquid.  Floral and ricey nose, with rubbing alcohol accented stepped on fruit, raspberries, maybe even pineapple.  Wow, smooth ghost-like cashmere mouthfeel leaving memories of soft, delicate fruits..Peaches & cream, a little funk, and a nice sweetness riding along.  This is stellar drinking right here.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"

854,"2008-11-16",4.3,"Pours almost completely clear with a faint yellow glow. Legs like glue. Nose is licorice, weed, blueberries, white peaches. Great mouthfeel like buttered water if that makes sense. (Water and silk maybe) Taste is the same as the nose with a nice fruity warming taste on the back end. Very good just layers of flavor that keep you coming back.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
854,"2008-11-16",4.3,"Pours a clear color with a slight green tinge. Ungodly alcohol legs...like nearly frozen vodka. Aroma is quite strong with peaches somee citrus, pineapples and berries. Taste is very fruity and well balanced. The strawberries come through with a hint of almond. Syrupy with a bit of well balanced alcohol. Great stuff!","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

Taste is quite smooth, silky with a sweetened rice that would compliment most sushi chefs. Finish is just as smooth and a decent neutral dry sweetness. Awesome!","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"

854,"2007-07-31",3.8,"Rated 7/29/07.  Served chilled at Social House in Las Vegas, NV.  Near colorless appearance with just the faintest light yellow tinge.  Very nice sweet fruity and floral aroma.  The flavor has a fair dose of pineapple, with lemon and ripe strawberries providing interesting complimentary flavors.  Silky smooth and a bit viscous on the palate.  Very nice ginjo that complimented spicy sushi just perfectly.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
