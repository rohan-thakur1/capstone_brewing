1732,"2016-03-27",2.7,"Draft pour at the Elysian bar, as part of my taking beer out of hiatus series. Transparent gold color with a short lived head. Near absent aroma. Flavor is a big yeast, apple, cool finish. No spice. Hints of a booziness, which surprised me. Apple linger. Weird hefe for me.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"

1732,"2009-08-17",3.3,"My mom offered me a taste of her hefe and I was glad I accepted.  Im not normally a big fan bu this one was pretty decent.  Hazy yellow with a thick head, has aromas of clove, banana, and malt, which managed to come through the lemon shed already squeezed into it.  Tastes were more of the same, with a fairly thick palate.  Finish of bitter wheat.","Portland, Oregon, USA","gracefullypunk"
1732,"2009-08-02",4.0,"On Tap At Elysian Fields Seattle. Pours out a hazy yellow topped with a tall head. Aroma was very nice lots of spice, banana, clove, and good malt. Taste was very nice as well.  The spice and malt. Thick body and just the right amount of sweetness. A very good Germ Hef. I think one of the best brew I have had from Elysian.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"
1732,"2008-08-22",3.6,"Shaker pint draft at the brewpub (Qwest field location). Pour is mostly clear orange ruby with a 1/2 inch pure white head. There are a couple of visible floaties. Aroma of banana, cloves, wheat and Hefe yeast.  Straight forward and solid hefe nose.  Taste is initially the wheat and banana, quickly followed by clove and coriander spiciness. There is also a fruit sour sweetness present which is nice. The finish has bit of hop bitterness that is nice and crisp, slightly tart and wheaty. Palate is light to medium, smooth and refreshing. Solid Hefe.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
1732,"2008-08-18",3.5,"Appealing cloudy straw-blonde with a creamy thick head. Wonderful aromatic bouquet of spicy phenolics, notably cloves and light banana with ample wheat and bread. Quite zesty. Nice wheaty and light banana and bread flavors, but the body is a bit flat, lacking effervescence. Sourish wheat finish. Not bad.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
1732,"2008-07-27",3.2,"V - cloudy pale orange

T - tart cloves, anise, fennel and coriander

1732,"2008-05-24",4.1,"5/2/08 on draught at Elysian Fields.  Aroma is highly phenolic and dominated by a plasticy clove note with light malt lingering in the background.  Appearance is a faintly hazy straw with a well maintained white head.  Flavor is peppery and fruity, very classic for the style.  Sweet malt blends evenly with the banana and pepper notes, right into medium noble hop bittering.  Mouthfeel is light medium bodied with a slightly spritzy carb bite.  Overall, very good with a great peppery bite you just miss when you put the glass down.","Renton, Washington, USA","Bradrcr"
1732,"2008-05-20",3.3,"Sample at the Pike Street location. This beer pours a mostly clear yellow-gold color with a thin white head that recedes steadily. Thin rings of lacing on the glass. The aroma is consists of bananas and wheat, along with a touch of yeast. Light, clean body with flavors of wheat, banana and mild hops, along with touches of fruit and clove. The finish is wheaty with a short fruity aftertaste that has a faint metallic tinge, not unlike the taste of Hi-C out of the can back in the day. Decent overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
1732,"2007-10-12",3.3,"on tap-pours a creamy retaining white head that laces and cloudy yellow color.  Aroma is banana, wheat, clove.  Taste is banana, wheat, clove, lemony, musty.  Nice.  Good effervescence.","Florida and, New Jersey, USA","jcwattsrugger"
1732,"2007-09-04",3.6,"Opaque vibrant yellow.  Big bubblegum nose with floral accents and lemon.  Full body, but not hugely sweet - some light fruit, light banana, yeast, maybe some wheaty tartness.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1732,"2007-07-30",3.7,"Draught sample at brewery. Nice Hefeweizen aroma with banana and cloves and mild bubblegum esters. Cloudy pale golden-butterscotch with foamy lacing white head. Meidum bodied with medium-light carbonation. Very smooth. Starts with nice yeasty-wheaty flavor. Banana and clove and Beemans gum. Good yeasty mild chalky finish with sweet banana-yeast after. Pretty decent Hefeweizen.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"
1732,"2007-07-28",4.6,"Sampled this one on draught at the brewery in Seattle, WA. This beer pours to a cloudy, deep golden color, with a tall, rocky head, and a vibrant carbonation. The nose on this beer is excellent, with good estery aromas of banan, pear, clove, and pear. The palate is excellent as well with good pale and tart wheat malt character, paired with fruity esters of banana, and green apple. This beer finishes with more excellent tart and thirst quenching wheat malt flavor up front, then ends with a spicy clove finish that lingers. Outstanding example of Bavarian hefeweizen, just packed with aromas and flavors. This beer is so quaffable and delicious, I could have spent an entire afternoon drinking this one at the bar at Elysian.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"
1732,"2007-07-13",3.5,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2007 Had this at Elysian Fields. Standard hefe color with a Bavarian Style aroma. Flavor was the same mostly clove and banana and some citrus due to the lemon that was added before it was given to me. Remember this being very smooth and easy to drink. I can appreciate this though because I have a good idea as to how good it is without the lemon in the glass.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
1732,"2007-06-02",3.8,"Draft at Elysian Fields. Pours depe murky gold with a thin white film that hands around the sides of the glass a bit. Mild banana on the nose, with more prominent bubblegum notes. Attack is mild except for the flavor--all the big banana, clove, and bubblegum you could ever want. Gorgeous and drinkable, just a wee bit on the thick side to be truly refreshing--but thats a pretty small hair to split.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
1732,"2007-02-12",4.2,"Draught sampler at Elysian Brewpub, Seattle. Hazy light golden with a small white head. Very nice yeast, citrus, bubblegum & spice notes in the aroma and flavour. Soft mouthfeel with a pleasant tingle on the back of the tongue. A fantastic hefe that completely kicks ass on the Pyramid Hefe I had the night before.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
1732,"2006-11-07",4.2,"On tap at Elysian, Capitol Hill, Seattle.  Orange gold colour with lasting white head.  Lemony flavour.  Good wheat presence.  Very competent, tasty hefe.  Good lemon, spice, esters, banana.  Very good quality German style hefe.  Couldnt pick it as not being German.  Bit of hop on end completes the picture.  Bit of bubblegum.  Nice esters on aroma.  Good lacing on glass.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
