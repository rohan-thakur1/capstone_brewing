2051,"2014-07-27",3.6,"Transfer from BA review on 8-17-12-
 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

 Appearance  Served a hazy golden orange color with a one finger white head. The head faded slowly over time to give a spotty lacing.

 Smell  The aroma is heaviest citrus and a sweeter malt smell. Mixed with these are aromas of a more woody and peaty nature as well as some lighter notes of yeast and spice.

 Taste  The taste begins with a nice caramel flavor with some hints of a citrus sweetness mixed within. As the flavor moves forward some buttery flavors comes to the tongue, with the caramel taste that was present in the beginning taking a more toffee like nature. This buttery flavor is also accompanied by some yeast as well as a nice oak like taste. These flavor blend well with the sweet and savory flavors the preceded their arrival and create a nice smooth taste. Toward the end, a light herbal flavor mixes with the rest to leave a nice lingering aftertaste on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer was on the average side with the carbonation level being slightly on the higher side. While a slightly thicker body may have been better for the toffee and buttery flavors, the carbonation did do a nice job with in making it a rather refreshing tasting brew. Overall a pretty good balance.

 Overall  A pretty easy drinking brew with some nice oak and yeasty flavors. Quite enjoyable.","","Darkmagus82"

2051,"2014-03-23",4.0,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance had a dark orange/brown body yielding a two and a half finger head in the chalice and closer to a one and a half finger head in the tulip, lightly clingy lacing in the chalice eventually spiderwebs after a good three minutes, closer to a minute of lacing spider-webbing in the tulip.
The smell had clove, subdued Belgian yeast/banana thing goin on, fruit, spice, combined maple/wood/syrup thing goin on startin to come out as the beer warms, noticeable pear as it continues to warm, honey - hmmm... unsure, alcohol not noted.
The taste was mainly sweet through previously mentioned flavors, slightly oaky and floral at different times, slightly bready as well.
The palate sits about a medium, slightly sessionable - mostly smooth, sticky sweet aftertaste and finish, adequate carbonation is felt, alcohol not felt.
Overall, though Ive had some Biere de gardes before I dont have much to compare to - as I continue to explore this style, very complex smell.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

2051,"2013-06-19",3.3,"In short: A yeasty amber ale with a bit of many things that do not add-up to a whole lot. Ok.
How: Bottle 750ml, consumed 2 months after purchase.
The look: Medium-cloudy amber body topped by a persistent small off-white head.
In long: Nose is yeasty fruity esters (ripe bananas, ripe apples, watermelons, more) along with a little dank-farmhouse sensation.  Taste is also quite fruity but with less of an overripe character as the aroma.  We start with lots of cookies then top them off with pears, watermelons, kiwis, and others.  All that swimming in yeasty mixture.  Then we add discreet but effective spicy-grassy-floral hops.  Pleasant Belgian-style mouthfeel.  No bitterness to speak of but the spicy-grassy hops dry out the finish nicely.  Almost no alcohol heat.  A light overall farmhouse character.  I cant find anything wrong with individual elements of the beer, yet the whole thing didnt overwhelmed me.  Just an ok beer, I expect better from Ommegang.

2051,"2012-12-14",3.4,"A steady pour into my Bruery tulip produces a two finger thick, pale amber tinged, tan colored head. The beer is a dark amber color that shows a hazy, bright, red tinged, dark straw color when held up to the light. The aroma smells quite a bit like pear as I pour this. A closer inspection yields the same, but backed by dusty pale malt, touches of woody notes, some oak like fruit character, a touch of woody spice, some melon like character. There is almost a savory quality to the toasty, cracker like malt in the nose here; as the beer warms up a nice nutty note starts to come out in the aroma.

The flavor has a firm spiciness from both the hop character and the oak. The finish is almost peppery, definitely a bit astringent, certainly woody, there is a light bitterness here that gets buried underneath the oak spiciness, and even a soft vanillin note that is noticeable from the beginning of each sip through to the end. There is a nice fruitiness here that reminds me of pears, perhaps a touch of floral apple, and even some grape (perhaps Chardonnay) like notes that are likely accentuated by the oak character. Some clove like notes are added from the yeast character, as well as accentuating some of the other spice notes. The beer has a certain heft to it, though it is quite quaffable, there is just enough body to provide a hint of palate lingering character. The oak does seem to accentuate a heat here that is easily mistaken for, or at least accentuates, the alcohol. Lightly caramelized, nicely whole grain cracker like malt notes form the backbone of the flavor profile.

The oak plays pretty well here in this beer, in fact it would likely be a lesser beer without it, but I cant help but feel that oak just gets in the way somehow. I dont get any sense of the maple wood, but then again, I have no idea what that would taste like.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2051,"2012-11-02",2.7,"Hazy orange ale covered by a gentle, mostly lasting white cover. Highly estery (melon, pear, banana...) yeast character is the focus point of the aroma, but theres also plenty of honeyed, almost biscuity malts in this ale in which the oak is not overbearing, but feeling purposeless from start to finish. That particular component has a negative bearing on many fronts to me, rendering the carbonation that seems well constituted with large, natural bubbles, but they seem largely eaten out by the aging and fade out rather quickly, leaving a flabby texture accentuating the generous residual sugar dosages which hamper drinkability. Indeed, sugary stewed fruits and vanilla fill the palate and are never sufficiently cut through by the seemingly fine, but insufficiently prominent spicy, flowery, herbal hops of noble character. Alcohol is quite noticeable, but Ommegang never really seemed to care about hiding it. To me, a rare subpar beer from Ommegang.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

2051,"2012-08-08",4.3,"Corked bottle and served in my Ommegang 10 Anno Tulip: Pours a deep golden near amber hue with a lovely frothy head that left very good lacework upon the glassware. The aroma has notes of herbal and grassy noble hops,  pils and aromatic malts, very light oak, and very so slight Herbs de Provence character that adds both a savory and flowery ester to the nose. Some golden candi sugar vapours as well. The taste starts with a ode to pale malts, plenty of pils malt snap along with some twangy sublime apricot notes. Very minimal tannic oak flavors and feel. I get a touch of crystal malt sweetness as this warms but also start getting some light pepper and lemon thyme.  It is one of those rare birds that seems very simple and unassuming but when you dig deeper you find some hidden complexities.  The best news is that it is not a ""soured"" farmhouse ale as so many American breweries think farmhouse ale need to be. While this could gain some lactic nature with age (due to wood aging), I think it would be a shame to let this get any older than 6 months and lose the crafted hop character.  The mouth feel is sprite and refreshing and the alcohol is so well hidden that it comes off as a session ale. Dry but overly dry finish. If I could I would give the palate a 6, it is so perfect to match the flavor profile.  Wow, I am more that happy with this brew, greatly exceeded my expections.

A little yeast shines through with the fruity esters being prominent. Finishes clean and surprisingly dry for how sweet it is. Not overly sweet, just on top of the spice and fruit for me. Pretty good.","Kingston, New York, USA","yobdoog"
2051,"2012-07-18",4.1,"Pour results in a two finger dense head composed of small bubbles that has decent retention, eventually settling into a solid thin cap. Sticky lacing abounds. The body is beautiful dark amber with ruby highlights and light trails of carbonation visible.Subtle and light nose. Nothing is going to knock you out. Mostly toasted malts, caramel and some biscuit. Hints of woody oak and some modest herbal hop notes are present. It finishes with a nice citrus sweetness. Sweeter than I would normally like in a Biere de Garde, but its somewhat restrained by a drying finish. There is an underlying tartness well-hidden under the fruitier, sweeter malt qualities. Theres a subtle clove and pepper that you might expect from this style. Im not really picking up the maple and oak notes, except for the dry finish.Medium-bodied with lively carbonation that prickles the tongue. Overall, clean and crisp.This has the potential to be outstanding ale with some cellaring. Its a collection of great components that just need some time to figure out where they fit in. One would think the oak and maple over time would tame some of the sweetness. Only time will tell.","South Euclid, Ohio, USA","DoublEE"

I know nothing about this style and didnt expect much, but this tastes fresh with a touch of sweet fruit and major Belgian yeast. A sharpness to it thats almost piney?","New York, New York, USA","hivemind"
2051,"2012-07-17",3.9,"Bottle from Julios. Pours out a deep sandy copper color, with a thick light tan head. Aroma of sweet pepper and burnt rubber. Flavor is complex. Dark plums, more burnt rubber, some cinnamon, wood, earth and yeast. Medium to heavy body, but very smooth overall.
