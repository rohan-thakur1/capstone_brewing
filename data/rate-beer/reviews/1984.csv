1984,"2017-01-18",4.1,"Ive certainly never had such a good brown ale. Immaculate balance and wonderfully subtle like good satire. Pecan and light caramel. A touch of graham cracker and chocolate. Brown pour with good head and lacing. Bittersweet finish. Tap at Churchkey.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"
1984,"2017-01-11",4.1,"On tap at the brewery. Brown appearance with a tan head. Aroma of nutty malts, caramel, toffee, vanilla and brown sugar. Similar flavor, rich and moderately sweet, balanced by a mild bitterness. Medium body with a smooth, creamy feel and a light dry, bittersweet finish. Wow, probably my favorite here so far.","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"
1984,"2016-12-13",3.9,"750 ml. bottle. Pours a cloudy brown with a nice beige head. Aroma of malt, vanilla, and nuts. Taste is roasted malt, vanilla, pecans, caramel, and maple. Tastes much better as it warms. Delicious.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
1984,"2016-11-12",4.1,"The beer pours murky brown with a beige head. The aroma had toasty malt, rich notes, light maple some vanilla. Very lush and inviting. It has lush full body with very soft carbonation. The taste has caramel, nuttiness, maple richness without cloying sweetness, vanilla, light spice and clean woodiness. Pretty much a wonderful beer than had a nice melding of all the aspects.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
1984,"2015-12-07",3.6,"Growler with thanks to Brian! Pours slightly hazy chestnut, medium creamy tan head, dissipates fairly slowly, great lacing. So far, so good. Aroma is roasty, nutty, dark sugars and light coffee, vanilla. Flavor is light plus sweet, mocha, nuts, roasted malts. Light bitterness and a light acidity from all the roast. Medium body, lingering bitterness gets stronger with time. Decent enough, but a four point beer?","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
1984,"2015-12-07",4.2,"Dark brown pour with light beige head. Aroma of roasted malts, maple syrup, pecans, vanilla and faint hops. Taste of sweet malts, pecans, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla and very faint hops. Medium bodied, perfect carbonation and mouthfeel, perfectly balanced. Not cloying at all and very drinkable, excellent beer!","Calgary, CANADA","maley1"
1984,"2015-11-20",4.0,"Poured a medium brown color with a white head. Aroma was of toasted malt, caramel, light chocolate, vanilla, inviting. Flavor similar, bold clean brown ale, with oder ate caramel and vanilla sweetness. Very well balanced and extremely flavorful for the abv.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
1984,"2015-05-12",3.8,"At first sip, its hard to see why people get so excited about this beer. Sure, a smooth nuttiness and roasty character play off the thin, medium-light body in a very drinkable way -- but overall, its a very standard, forgettable brew. But wait for the glass to warm and you will be rewarded. As the beer nears room temperature, the deep, sweet aromas of the season emerge. Maple syrup, unimpeded by American ale yeast, leads the way for other saccharine stuff like French vanilla and brown sugar. Mint, plum, alcohol and roasted pecan swirl in the background. When cold, Picacho Pecan Pies flavor is that of a straightforward brown ale: toasty and nutty. Even when warm, the roasty flavors of bread, pecans and mild coffee lead. Its after the swallow that things get interesting, with vanilla beans and pecan skins rising up to smooth out the beers edges. None of these flavors, however, are very powerful -- those looking for the sweet, intense flavors of a pecan pie should look elsewhere. No, this brew is about balance and drinkability with a subtle twist, which is how Wilderness brewers tend to operate.","","PartyFowle"
1984,"2015-03-29",3.1,"growler, this is was weird, a mix of sweet molasses, nougat, chocolate, roasty, but the balance was a little off for more, nontheless not offensive at all.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
1984,"2014-11-23",4.0,"Smells like a nut brown ale and tastes like a nice nut brown ale too. I can taste the pecans, but it is more of a roasted nut taste than an actual pecan pie. Medium body with medium carbonation.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
1984,"2014-11-05",4.3,"Draft at brewpub. Deep dark mahogany. Nice khaki head. Roasty. Cocoa. Bread crust. Vanilla. Pecan. Brown sugar. Light maple syrup. Delicious sweetness but bot overboard or cloying or sticky.. Not bitter. Good balance. Great drinkability. Slick medium body. A lot of character packed into neat, clean package.","Arizona, USA","beerbaaron"
1984,"2014-11-02",4.4,"On draft at AZWBC. Pours a deep brown with a light brown head. Aroma is molasses, Pecans, roasted malt. Taste is brown sugar, pecans, molasses, vanilla. Pecan pie in a glass. Nice brew.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Rusty"
1984,"2014-11-01",3.6,"Basic brown ale nose, leads to a thick, rich mouthfeel. As it warms, blasts of vanilla bean fill the palate. Really hard to find a hint of pecans, but the sweetness makes this a pleasant brew.","","beersighted"
1984,"2013-11-26",4.5,"Pours very dark brown out of tap at ratebeer sneek peak party. Aroma vanilla and brown sugar. Taste of roasted vanilla and subtle pecan. Very tasty!!","Alabama, USA","thebitterendaz"
1984,"2013-11-03",4.0,"Poured up on tap at Wilderness where it has a deep dark mahogany colored body that supports a thin tan head. The aroma offers up smooth notes of dark roasted malts, chocolate malts, earthy chocolate and as it warmed a nuttiness comes to the surface. The taste has malt sweetened dark roasted malts, some nice chocolate notes and then hitting about midway is a mild nuttiness. It ends as the roasted malt notes and sweet nutty malts move forward creating a smooth finish.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
1984,"2013-11-02",5.0,"UPDATED: NOV 4, 2013 Great aroma and taste. It pours an nice brown to almost black. You get the flavor of pecan and sweet.","Arizona, USA","storminorman"
1984,"2013-10-31",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 1, 2013 From a growler. Nice nutty nose of roasted pecans, hazelnuts, cinnamon sugar, and light maple syrup. Pours very dark brown with a big tan head that quickly dissipates to half its original size. Rich taste of brown sugar, vanilla, pie dough, the right amount of nuttiness (not overly bitter), caramel, and a delightful light touch of espresso. The flavor manages to be decadent while remaining light and very refreshing. The finish is sweet and long. Damn, another home run by Jon and Pat at AZWBC.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
1984,"2013-10-31",3.0,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2013 Over the top vanilla and sweet molasses notes. Dark brown color. Head dissapated quickly. Very little pecan flavor or nuttiness. I really wasnt impressed with this beer. Thought of it more like a homebrew experiment that came out with a drinkable beer but nothing like they wanted it to Had this again at Flannys. Comparing to other beers there made me want to rescore this. The beer is entirely too sweet to the point of being sickly sweet.","USA","bigbeersrule"
1984,"2013-10-31",4.2,"On tap at the Arizona Wilderness Brewery. Appearance is dark, almost black, with a rich cream colored head that slowly dissipates. Aroma is above all vanilla, with caramel, roasted malt, roasted nuts and subtle pecans. Taste is delicious, creamy vanilla, roasted malt and pecans, with some coffee. Finish is smooth and creamy. Another winner from Arizona Wilderness.","Gilbert, Arizona, USA","RB1"
1984,"2013-10-30",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2013 Dark brown pour. Aroma is hints of vanilla and dark chocolate. Flavors of roasted vanilla, toffee and pecans make this a great dessert beer. Becomes even more delicious as it warms to room temperature. Awesome!","Arizona, USA","StephTamiko"
1984,"2013-10-30",4.6,"Pours dark brown nearly black with a sexy off white head. Aroma is vanilla and perhaps molasses. Flavors are vanilla and slight nuttiness, as it warms a nice sweet, molasses/maple syrup flavor comes through with a touch of roast. Mouthfeel is very nice for a brown, not too heavy it sits well for a fall seasonal. Overall a standout beer I am going to OD on this!","Chandler, Arizona, USA","AZBennett"
1984,"2013-10-30",4.5,"Wow what a pleasant surprise! This beer is dark in color and rich in flavor. Aroma/. vanilla and pecans. Flavor profile is brought out more when it warms up. Taste: slightly smoky in flavor, with vanilla undertones. Pecan is more prominent on the back end. Slightly sweet with a hint of bitter, just like pecan pie should be.","","Kondominium"
1984,"2013-10-30",4.6,"Wow. Bark brown pour with lasting halo of toffee-colored head. Aromas of vanilla and semi-sweet nuttyness. Flavors of candied fruit and roasted nuts, caramel and vanilla cinnamon goodness. Absolutely delicious. Let this warm up!","Arizona, USA","JustDrinkIt"
1984,"2013-10-30",4.4,"That. Is. GOOD! I had no idea what to expect with this, and thinking about pecan pie... I expected it to be sweet. It was, but not overwhelmingly so. It was just the right amount of sweet that had a wonderful maple finish. The maple was added late, but it is a manageable maple. They used vanilla in this beer, too. It has a nice milk stout mouthfeel that I like... Everything from this brewery is good, and I am stoked that I was invited to try this before it was released to the public. Cheers to all my beer drinking buddies here!","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","rickyleepotts"
1984,"2013-10-30",4.5,"Hits you on the nose with nutty vanilla tones. Appearance is very dark, no real transparency. Taste is where this beer kicks on, vanilla up front nice, very dry finish with nuttiness. I greatly look forward to the possible bourbon barrel version.

1984,"2013-10-30",4.5,"Deep dark pour. Looks more like a porter than a brown, but who cares about that? This beer is delicious! Lovely slightly nutty aroma, with vanilla. Taste is of Vanilla, maple syrup, with a hint of pecans in the backbone. 

You can keep your pumpkin porters, I'll take this as a Fall beer any day of the week!

1984,"2013-10-30",4.5,"Pours a cola like brown with a nice tan head. Aromas remind me of grandmas kitchen during thanksgiving when she was baking pecan pies.
