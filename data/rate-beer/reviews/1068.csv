1068,"2016-12-29",3.7,"Bottle at WTF 3. Pours a hazy yellow with small white head that diminishes to nothing. The aroma is apple core, pear, oak. Medium body, apple, pear, nice sweetness, dry finish, very good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
1068,"2014-12-16",3.9,"Bottle, shared by me... in a location remote of my dining room.
Pours hazy with a pale straw color.

The aroma is lightly funky, bright and fruity with some modest sweetness. 

The flavor is nicely tart, even a touch sour at times. Its a touch sweeter than I would like it to be, but its far from anything Id call a ""sweet"" perry. Its got a nice fruitiness and some good minerallity. Its got some pear flavor but I genuinely suspect that its made wholly of pear varietials that Id simply not familiar with, so it doesnt really come off as overly ""pear-like"".

Absolutely delicious thought.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
1068,"2014-11-20",3.6,"Bottle @ The Festival 2014. Pale golden color with champagne fizz and carbonation. Smells of sweet candied pear and vanilla. Some mild acidity, yeast, and a slight pie crust note to it. Flavor has a pleasant sweetness to it, but is well balanced with acidity. A touch of yeast and sweet crust. Hints of vanilla, lemon zest, and potpourri.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

>> Hazy white pour. Weak foam. Wow- aroma of God, extremely fresh pear. Super rich green and yellow pear taste. Insane. Extreme carbonation. Bright and lively on the palate. Robust pear flavor exploding in your mouth. Intense acid brings that much needed balance that is usually lacking in Poire and abundant in Cidre Bruit. At this farmhouse, the reverse is true with their perry kicking the ciders butt on the acid balance front.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
1068,"2014-03-26",3.3,"Champagne cork bottle. Low fluffy and quickly disappearing white head. Hazy yellow golden body. Mild apples aroma. Powerful dry and a bit acidic apples flavor with a long finish.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Skinnyviking"
1068,"2013-06-22",3.9,"Bottle sample at The Festival. Hazy golden yellow color, few fluffy bubbles. Aroma of stonefruit, summer fruit. Taste is smooth, fresh fruit, dusty and peppery edges, very full body. Delicious.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
1068,"2013-02-24",3.8,"Sampled at the 2013 Chicago Cider Summit. Pours a clear pale gold with a white head that starts and remains at the edges with visible carbonation. Aroma has a perfumey pear note with a bit of tartness backing. Flavor starts with sweet pear that remains throughout and is joined by a touch of tartness.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
1068,"2012-11-03",3.0,"Tasting in between sessions at Sheltons ""The-Fest"". Clear straw body. Active. Smells of bruised pears & fresh compost. Not too potent or perfumey like other examples of Perry. Taste is sweet & quick. A bit tart, turning sour. Dry & airy. So-so carbonation from a near bottomed out bottle. Sierra Mist finish. Mellow.","FT: Stale Polotmavý in Queens, New York, USA","MicroGrog"
1068,"2012-10-08",2.8,"Bottle. Head is initially small, fizzy, white, fully diminishing. Body is hazy light yellow. Aroma is very light notes of oak, apple/pear, cork, mold. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Medium body, watery texture, fizzy carbonation, moderately astringent, lightly alcoholic. Well, after the amazing Demi-Sec cider, I figured this would be another 4+ gem, and certainly be in the ranks of Olivers Dry Perry, but alas, there is almost no aroma whatsoever...its almost like smelling water.  But in the mouth its very well balanced and enjoyable, surprisingly.  One of the most disparate nose/mouth scores I think Ive ever given.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1068,"2010-07-15",3.3,"Foggy white colour, plenty of head but it goes away fast. Aroma of apple and pear, some wood. Taste is very dry and sour apple, bitter finish.","Alberta, CANADA","DeanF"
