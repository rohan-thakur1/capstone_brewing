4105,"2015-07-09",2.9,"Certain for a fact I had this during Toer de Gueuze. Cask, served flat, very hazy, metallic aroma with some sulfur and wheat. Taste, very sour, vinegar, lemonade and a little bit of cheese. Of the Jonge Lambik, this doesnt rate too high for me.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

4105,"2014-08-21",3.7,"UPDATED: SEP 3, 2014 Blend of wort from other lambic brewers (Hanssens doesnt make lambic wort themselves) fermented at Hanssens and the basis of their kriek and geuze. Warm orange golden colour, quite neig character, very estery and fruity, lemon, orange, vinegar acidity, sharp but refreshing with a long finish.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
4105,"2014-05-26",3.1,"At WE of Spontaneous Fermentation 2014. Hazy yellow with a small off-white head and a light ring of foam. Aroma is buttery with some white wine, hay, grassy and cheesy. Taste is also of hay with light funky, buttery notes, some residual sugars, grapes and grassy notes. Light body. Flat. Dry finish. Decent unblended lambic, but a tad too buttery for my liking. Still quenching.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
4105,"2014-05-26",3.2,"From bag in a box at WoFS 2014. Hazy flat yellow pour. Cheesy aroma, grapes, really fruity/winey, grassy notes. Taste is tart, malty, funky, lemony, light gastric notes. Palate is light, almost watery. Good.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
4105,"2013-07-08",3.8,"From the barrel @Hanssens Artisanaal. Hazy golden body with some fine bubbles. Low fully diminishing white head. Lemon- and tropical-fruty acidic aroma with notes of barnyard, wet grass and cellar. 
Clean flavor. Sour-fruity with lemon zest, unripe apples and grapeskin. Bone dry sour-acidic bretty fruit ending. Very good. [Toer de Gueuze 2013]","Oslo, NORWAY","OleR"

Lightly fruity sweet with a touch of mustiness lambic with some flowers, mild mellow,. Fruity sweet, very round & mellow lambic with light moldiness, lowers, light peach, old hops and light herbal touch. Flat, touch fuller body, outstanding, much better than the messed up old one I have had before.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

Plenty of aromas and taste of citrus, bit of almond.","kontich, BELGIUM","cucuma"
4105,"2011-06-03",4.1,"Cask at City Beer Store.  I was told this was the Jonge, but Im not entirely sure.  It was quite cloudy but had little head - possibly in between 6 and 12 months old.  Wonderfully tart with some good funk.  Acidic, lemony, yogurty, bracing.  Had about four glasses and was definitely feeling some stomach burn.  Nearly flat.  Great pucker.  Some horseblanket, cheese.  A delicious young lambic with a sourness that forced me to sip slowly.  I would love to have another shot at this one.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
4105,"2011-02-13",3.6,"Cask at Maxs. Mostly clear, light amber body with no head. Funky nose with light horseblanket, some pineapple, light grapefruit and a touch of yogurt. Moderately tart taste, lightly sweet, citrus juice, grapefruit rind, cherry, light honey sweetness and a bit of lemon zest. Medium body is soft with no carbonation.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"
4105,"2009-03-26",3.9,"I was able to sample this on cask at Maxs Taphouse in Baltimore during Maxs Belgian fest.  Pours a clear amber, orange with absolutely zero head and very little visible carbonation.  Aroma of sweet tarts, oranges and wood.  Flavor is very similar, orange, wood pulp, sweet and tart, yeasty with some flavor of white grapes.  Very even and clean on the palate and just a touch syrupy.  One of my favorites of the day.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
4105,"2009-02-28",3.7,"On cask at Maxs Belgian Fest: Pours a transparent deep golden orange with a thin ring of white head. Aroma of fresh light citrus notes and complex hay and a touch of cheesy funk and oak.  Body starts with a hint of biscuity sweetness giving way to a fairly assertive tartness with some lemongrass and horseblanket character toward the finish.  Pretty enjoyable and complex for a young beer.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
4105,"2009-02-15",4.0,"Cask pour at Maxs.  Pours a still slightly hazy apple juice color- dull coppery orange- no head.  Aroma is prickly acidic, lactic, farmhousey funk, acetaldehyde green apple and some dms vegetal- characteristic of a jonge lambic- seems more rounded out and complex than any other jonge I have had before like girardin.  Acidity and sourness in the flavor are also coming along nicely- more apple, and dms, but there is still some sugary sweetness in the middle that will break down with time- great prickly lactic bite on the finish and pretty smooth.  Actually reminded me a bit of the jonge lambic cask pin that bstill and jason served at MASHOUT last year.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
4105,"2009-02-15",4.7,"Cask at Maxs 72 Hours of Belgium.  Vinegar and apple aroma.  Medium sourness and medium body.  Slight carbonation remains and very soft.  Various fruits in the body too.  Mostly apricot.  Slight barnyard funk at the end of the beer. Yum.  Good brunch lambic.","Maryland, USA","mwelsh13"
4105,"2007-09-02",3.0,"Amber of color, no head. An aroma with sour notes of apples. A dry flavor with apple notes and a dry finish.","Vadum, DENMARK","Enjoyit"
4105,"2007-04-15",3.6,"Orange amber coloured beer with no carbonation and no head. Fresh sour fruity aroma. Full sour fruity palate also. Finish is again light sour, with some fruity and herby touches. Nice balanced.","Brussels, BELGIUM","Bart"
4105,"2007-04-15",1.5,"yellow orange body with no head and a fruity fragrant aroma and a moderate acidic flavor  and a acidic finish  i dont like this bad taste","Weelde, BELGIUM","Wim"
4105,"2004-05-30",3.7,"Murky amber-orange body.  No head.  Horse-blanket aroma.  Moderately bitter, moderately acidic initial flavour.  Lightly acidic (long) finish which is quite dry.","Aarschot, BELGIUM","diabel"
4105,"2003-05-24",3.9,"(It might seem strange to have lambic from a non-brewer. It is however, quite normal, for the blenders to have a basic lambicblending from which they work to establish their final gueuze). Colour is pale amber. No head. Nose is wood, piney, 'horseblanket', lactic acid. Sweet taste, subdued, like a medium-sweet draught cider. Retronasal very much wood and sulphur. Dry effect, long woodiness in the aftertaste. Nice, strange, but quite pleasant sweetrest.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
