There is a thin ring of brown head that lingers without leaving any lace. The aroma is big chocolate bourbon fudge. There is a light vanilla, but the bourbon and fudginess are spectacular. The hops have faded, and youre just left with something smooth, deep, chocolatey, and sexy. The flavor is just as fantastic. I love how the hop bitterness is just gone. The sweet chocolate and fudge roll into a heavy oak and light char with the bourbon and leave a lingering hint of vanilla behind.
