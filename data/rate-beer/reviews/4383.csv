A - Pours very dark brown, bordering on black, with a nice one and a half finger tall off-white head leaving spotty lace down the glass.


S - Smells of lots of dark roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and the faintest hint of citric hops. I am pretty sure that if this was a bit fresher I would have liked this one even more.


T - Starts off with a big dose of dark roasted malt slowly giving way to hints of coffee, chocolate, dark fruits, and the faintest of hints of hop bitterness. The finish is a mix of dark roast and light sweetness, lingering for some time.


M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Dark, toasty, feel with plenty of it sticking around through the finish. A bit stale and one dimensional. It could have used a bit of that hop bitterness I detected in the nose.

4383,"2012-08-05",3.5,"Poured from a 355ml bottle into a Pforzheimer Hausbrauerei 0.3l handled glass (Mar 12).

Pours a light black colour, chestnut brown when held to the light with a huuuuge frothy tan/off-white head. The head subsided after a few minutes but retained a good finger pretty much thereafter.

Dark roasted malts predominate on the nose with a hint of chocolate and caramel in the background.

Roasted malts again at the forefront of the flavours allied to a little chocolate, a little smoke, slightly sweet and a slightly - but not overpowering - bitter finish.

Mouthfeel is as good as any beer Ive had of this style in Deutschland. Well balanced and just the right level of carbonation.

Burnt bread, a hearty malt side that ends with a little bitter bite at the end.

4383,"2012-05-01",4.1,"Originally reviewed: 8/12/10. This has been one of the more elusive bottled D-R offerings for me, so when I saw a case at City Bev last week, I happily grabbed a sixer. Best by November, 2010 notched on label. 12oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass.

Pours a dark ruby-tinted chocolate brown. There isnt a bit of light creeping through at all. Great thick look. A large tan head grows on top. Retains fair enough. Leaves some light sticky lace behind. Scents of chocolate powder, fresh dark breads, ground coffee, and a husky dryness on the finish. 

The mouth is the weakest part of this beer. Its a little too thin for my liking; could stand a bit more depth in this dept. All is forgotten when I taste this though! Wow! Great chocolate-y flavors, with some light bitterness. Warm bready flavors as well. Slightly roasted as well. Excellent finish. This is one of the best of the style Ive ever had.

Lurking in the back of the fridge was one of the only Duck Rabbit beers that I have not tried from their original lineup. It instantly reminded me of the asset that people in North Carolina has access to. Proof that you can succeed without trying to take over the world I look forward to the day that I can pick it up with a long road trip.

Aroma / Appearance - Fluid and inky this was the near twin of Willoughbys on tap offering in appearance. A mocha head graced the top like an insulating layer of foam. Dark chocolate, slightly overcooked popcorn, and figs create a different experience which stands up to closer scrutiny. Not quite what I was expecting it took some time to adjust. However the smokiness in the base was worth the patience.

Flavor / Palate - The smoke filled the mouth with the taste of runoff water from an ash tray filtered of butts. Also present was a chocolately taste like licking the inside of a mold after forming novelty treats. The fluid mouthfeel is filling and refreshing without being overbearing. Should I ever find myself in the area I know exactly what I will be doing in the Carolinas one evening - visiting this excellent brewery.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

4383,"2011-02-18",3.5,"Poured into a flute. Lot of carbonation going on here. First pour yielded four plus fingers of head.

3.5 A: Black color. Three fingers of frothy light tan head. Good retention, but just touches of spotty lacing.

4.0 S: Dark roast coffee, roasted barley, ashy toastiness, and grainy. Finally, a slight touch of funkiness similar to what you might find in a Berliner.

4.0 T: Taste is much like the nose. Dark roast black coffee, roasted malts, ashy, smoky toastiness, and grainy.

3.5 M: Lighter medium body. Too much carbonation, which gets really annoying trying to pour this one. Roasty aftertaste and reasonably smooth. Anyway, too much carbonation, but okay otherwise.

4.5 D: Solid beer. Ive had more than half a dozen of this style now and Im really starting to appreciate it. Each one has been noticeably different. This one is definitely the roastiest one and is something Id like to drink at least once a year. Anyway, good drinkability. Tasty and interesting enough to warrant another.

The flavor is driven by roasted malts. I can detect bits of nut, and bittersweet chocolate, maybe some mild coffee. The beer then mellows into a soft sweetened roast with a lingering hop bitterness. This has all the right qualities of a Schwarzbier. Its full of dark malty flavors found in a porter or stout, but it possesses the light body frame of a lager, smooth and easy drinking.","Pennsylvania, USA","sarahmarie"

4383,"2010-08-21",4.0,"16 ounce pint - $5.25 at Taco Mac in Roswell, Georgia.

Appearance: Dispensed a dark brown, near black body beneath a scant layering of foam the color of sandstone (according to TheLibrarianGirl).

Smell: Smells of brewed and subsequently chilled coffee with a notable roastiness to it and tag along notes of smoked licorice rope, unsweetened chocolate, and fruits of the dark variety.

Taste: DRS has a start of sweet roastiness akin to sugar-sweetened coffee dosed with a small lump of bakers chocolate and trailed by a hint of smoky burnt grains and a very, very light touch of dark caramel. Some time and warmth bring about a small amount of roasted grain astringency. Slight dark fruitiness of prunes. Earthy, roasty bitterness. Continued roastiness and some mild, lingering bitterness on the drying finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Has a nice smoothness to the mouthfeel.

Drinkability: A quality Schwarzbier with its light lager qualities but still plenty of roasty, malty goodness.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Slight Duck Rabbit Milk Stout sweetness coming from this thing. Very subtle chocolate aroma rides along side an aggressive roast aroma that just punches you in the face. Perfect sweet aroma to balance the roast, but the aroma doesnt have that many dimensions if you ask me. I know this is a lager, but the texture is too light for me to want to enjoy the whole beer. Very nice sweet milk flavor, but then that bittering hop and roast flavor take over, but not to the point where you arent enjoying the beer. Touches of subtle smoke compliment the roast.

4383,"2009-12-02",4.0,"12oz bottle poured into a tulip.

Pours very dark, almost completely black in the glass, but not quite.  Theres a thick one-inch tan head that recedes slowly and leaves a surprising amount of lacing.

The aroma is fantastic, dominated by some heavily toasted malts bread.  Theres also plenty of coffee, heavily roasted coffee, and a faint chocolate sweetness in the background, though the massive toasted character is dominant.

The taste is slightly sweeter than the aroma and really tastes almost like a mocha with an extra shot of espresso.  Theres some coffee bitterness but with a toasted malt backbone and hints of chocolate and even some earthy hops in the finish.

For a schwarzbier, the body is full with decent carbonation and a very dry roasted finish.

4383,"2009-09-18",3.9,"bottle, walnut brown with good tan foam, aroma of nutty cocoa, roasty, flavors are light roast coffee, chocolate cake, light finish","Dallas, Texas, USA","blutt59"
4383,"2009-09-16",3.9,"12 oz bottle from Capones. Pours a dark black body with an average size bubbly super light beige head. The aroma on this one was really really nice with lots of complexity, cola, chocolate, toast, freeze dried coffee grounds, even slight vanklla extract. The palate on this one had just too much fizziness for the medium body that it was paired with. The flavor on this one is much more raosty then the aroma lets on with more coffee showing up and less chocolate. It is finished off with some burnt toast and very very slight soy sauce. This one was really well done but whats up with the hidden ABV??","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
4383,"2009-09-16",3.4,"12oz. bottle, with thanks to dchmela for another great bonus!  Pours a cola brown with a moderate fizzy tan head.  Aroma is chocolate malts, light coffee, and roast.  Flavor is more chocolate, coffee and light roast.  A nice take on the style, thanks again Dave!","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"
4383,"2009-09-15",3.8,"12 oz. Opaque schwarz with a small ring of bubbles. Typical D-R nose of big chocolate, coffee, and char. Taste is the same, with some earthy nut. Long ash and coffee finish. Medium body is watery, smooth, highly drinkable and roasty dry. Not so subtle dark flavors that seem like a lager/mix version of other D-R porters and stouts. That isnt a bad thing though.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
4383,"2009-09-14",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2010 Always excited to try another Duck Rabbit beer. Pours a dark copper that sits black in the glass. Wisps of a light tan head show on their on and a swirl of the glass reveals a creamy one finger head of the same color. Nose shows some burnt popcorn and toast. Sweet caramelly notes jump in and out and grain isnt too hard to pick up. The flavor is dominated by roasted grain. Hop presence is very balanced and mildly present with some spicy notes. Some sweet malt flavors show with warmth. Also notice some mild astringency, not sure if it is from grain or hop. Palates is nicely balanced with showings of grain roast and sweetness along with a spicy hop character.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
4383,"2009-09-09",3.5,"Very dark, almost black with some amber light.  Small creamy, foamy lacing.  Coffee dominates aroma, with some hazelnut.  Short tasting with coffee bitterness in aftertaste.","North Carolina, USA","areyouinning"
4383,"2009-09-06",3.4,"UPDATED: SEP 12, 2010 Near black, with minimal head, copper at edges.  Smells like coffee and ash with chocolate nuts.  Taste is smokey and burnt with strong coffee/mocaish flavor, very light on the tongue, tastes kind of like a porter.  Finish is bitter quite like black coffee.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","TheGB"
4383,"2009-09-03",2.8,"Moderately strong coffe and oak nose. Cola colored with no head. Uncomplicated flavor of charred oak. Bark finish. Flat soda mouthfeel. Pretty straightforward, nothing outstanding.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"

4383,"2009-08-24",4.1,"Dark brown/black. Aroma of dark chocolate and espresso. Flavor is more of the same; very malty and roasty with just enough bitterness to let you know the hops are there. Just a hint of dark fruit, that reminds me of the DR Baltic Porter. Light-medium body with a very dry, clean finish. Perfect dark beer for the summer months. This is a top notch brew and will keep me content until their Baltic rears its head this fall.","Blowing Rock, North Carolina, USA","BleacherBum"

4383,"2009-08-23",4.2,"Pours black with an off white head that laces the rim of the glass.  Nice malty aroma.  The thin mouthfeel is offset by the overwhelming flavors of the dark malts bursting through with chocolate and coffee flavors.  Nice finish with a very mild hopping that ends each sip nicely.  A great Dark Beer for the Summertime!  Paul and the gang has hit this one out of the park!  Way to go, GUYS!!!!!","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","doboy"

Taste is on par with the aroma, with some tea and nuts mixed in. Not near as thin as I may have expected.

4383,"2009-08-19",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 24, 2010 Bottle. Slightly translucent black, big thick head. Smells fantastic with bittersweet chocolate and coffee. Starts off with a bit of sweetness, then follows with great roasted flavors. Great, clean finish with no unwanted sourness. I LOVED this beer.


RERATE: No change to the rating numbers here. Just a reminder to myself that this is a sick session beer to have available as much as possible. A dark malty break without being sticky or abrasive.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","DukeBrewDevil"
4383,"2009-08-18",3.7,"Draft at whole food fairfax. Pours dark with creamy tan head. Aroma is subtle of roasted malt. Mouthful is crisp with hints of cocoa. Finish is dry.","Fairfax Station, Virginia, USA","carl4beer"
4383,"2009-08-16",3.8,"Black and thin in the glass.  Aromas of roasted coffee and dark chocolate.  Plenty of malt.  The beer is fine and delicate on the tongue, with a light finish which pulls back on the flavors.  Lacking the acidity that would really make this beer special, but its still quite a feat to make a beer this dark and aromatic taste so light and refreshing.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","jefcon"
4383,"2009-08-09",4.1,"Bottle  Pours a nice dark brown almost black with a thin tan head.  The head lasts well and laces nicely.  Has good aroma of roast, chocolate, and coffee.  Has a good carbonation and a wonderful mouthfeel.  Has a good flavor.  Not too strong but just hearty enough.  Has a good medium body.  The texture is mildly thick but good.  Has a great finish with a good aftertaste.  This is another awesome beer from the DR.","Perkasie, Pennsylvania, USA","Birdiebeagle"
4383,"2009-08-07",3.9,"On tap at Milltown, with Turd, durhambeer, and some jackass who hates beer. Ethan, embrace the freedom embodied in the DR schwarz! Seriously, I really enjoyed this beer. A bold pour, with some moderate carbonation and a thick head. Big roasted malts and some campfire in the nose. Full body, very nice and gets the flavors playing nicely. Zesty even though its got a dark countenance. Another nice one from the Farmville crew.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
4383,"2009-08-07",3.9,"Lets make this official.   Draught at Milltown in the company of JCB, durhambeer, and emacgee.  Always enjoy drinking with my crew.

Pours black with light tan head that turns into a ring with nice lacing.  Smells roasty and chocolately in the best way... I usually dont dig chocolate flavors in beer, but this is perfect. Nuts and bitter cocoa and coffee and toffee notes.  Mild campfire/smoke, but not overpowering.  Light body. Dry finish. Really damn good.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","durhambeer"
4383,"2009-08-04",3.8,"Serving: Draft at Fireworks.
Appearance: Almost pitch black with a small, tan head.
Aroma: Raisins, roasted malt, and a bit of coffee.
Taste: Coffee, sharp burnt notes, and a malt sweetness that reminds me of very dark grapes.  A nice barbeque smokiness comes out as the beer warms.
Palate: Medium-high carbonation with a medium mouthfeel and a short, slightly dry finish.
Overall: I loved the barbeque notes.  Definitely worth trying.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"
4383,"2009-08-03",4.0,"On tap at Flying Saucer in Raleigh.  Dark cola-like pour.  Sweet aroma of caramel and maple syrup.  Flavor of roasted malt, toffee, and dark chocolate.  I dont have a lot of experience with this style but so far I am very impressed.  This is a great beer from a brewery I am becoming more and more impressed with.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","zizzybalubba"
4383,"2009-08-02",4.0,"Black pour with a slightly translucent body when held in light.  Tan head with lush spotty lace.  Big roasted aroma, which is on the verge of being smokey.  Medium bodied. Full roasty flavor with notable hints of coffee and chocolate.  Very well done!","raleigh, North Carolina, USA","ucusty"
4383,"2009-08-01",4.2,"Bottle pours black with off white head.  Aroma is coffee, chocolate, smoke,  almond, and some hops.  Silky mouthfeel.  Flavor follows the nose.  This brew has layers of complexity.  The smoke flavors play well with the chocolate and coffee flavors.  Finishes with a roast coffee note.  This is one smooth brew.  Nice job.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","fiver29"
4383,"2009-08-01",3.9,"Pours a fine dark brown with a short off white head.  Aromas of pine/citrus hops, slightly smoky roasted malt, and dark brown sugar.  Flavor is malty, toasty, and slightly hoppy with a bitter finish that is a bit too pronounced for my tastes.  It is, however, very crisp and refreshing and great as a session beer.  Another great brew from Duck-Rabbit!","Durham, North Carolina, USA","DMRz"
4383,"2009-08-01",4.0,"12 oz. bottle. Pours dark brown with garnet highlights - opaque due to color but otherwise very clear - and with a nice but short-lasting tan head. Aroma of toasted malt, some caramel, dark coffee, burnt molasses and some noble hops on the back. Rich, roasty flavor with lots of expresso, bakers chocolate, but a strong close of hops into a long, dry finish. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated; smooth. Excellent, full-flavored schwarzbier.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","surffisher"
4383,"2009-07-30",3.9,"12 oz.  Picked up a six of this at a local tasting and Im down to the last one so I better review it.
A somewhat transluscent black pour, some white bubbly head.  Good amount of chocolate, roast malt in the aroma, with some of that, lager smell, not sure quite what to call it.  Light/medium body not quite creamy, refreshing on the pallet.  Roasted chocolate malt, cocoa, burnt nut with some piney hints throughout.  Finish is just a bit of roast coffee.
A real good drinker of a Schwarzbier, like it should be.  One of Duck Rabbits best efforts, saying something considering their others are good as well.
I wish more breweries would focus on this style, this is the session beer for the dark beer fan.","from Michigan now in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","timsilvia32"
