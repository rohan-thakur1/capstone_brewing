The taste has a round, bitterness due to creamy mouthfeel with light citrus there and some grassy hops in the finish. Lingering bitterness and a very good mouthfeel.","Baarn, NETHERLANDS","skortila"
917,"2011-10-04",2.7,"330mL thanks to NoiZe. The pour is a hazy glowing gold with a massive, bright white head. Huge ice cream scoop retention and massive lace. Nose is odd: lime, melon, fresh lemon peel, doughy yeast..but moves to something weird like peanuts. Not sure what is going on. Taste is quite leafy, herbal. Gets quite astringent. Then moves to something odd like grape soda and saltwater. Im not sure what is going on here but it feels like it has been infected by something very odd that is just starting to manifest itself. Almost peanut butter and jelly in profile....strange.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
