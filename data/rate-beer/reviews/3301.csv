3301,"2017-02-11",4.2,"2 litre growler from the brewery shop, bb April 7 2017.
Golden, hazy body, with a big, fluffy, lacing, white head. 
Aroma of flowers, hay, grains, bread, some sweet fruits, some biscuit, even slight vanilla. 
Very smooth taste, with quite similar aromas, but with more of the smooth bread and biscuity sweetness, a subtle hop bitterness and a slight dryness. 
Medium, a bit oily mouthfeel, with an average carbonation. 
Finishes smooth, bready, floral, hoppy, a bit sweet, a bit dry. 

Wow, this is the perfect Zwickl! Never had another style example before, with such a depth and smoothness. The balance is outstanding, sweet, hoppy and bready notes in perfect harmony. And this is so quaffable, it shouldnt be difficult to empty the growler on my own I guess. Maybe Im crazy giving such a high score for a pale 5% ABV Lager beer, but I dont care, this is perfection in its category, cant imagine a better style example!","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"

3301,"2016-12-14",3.3,"Hazy yellow with medium white head. Aroma is some green stuff, grass, citrus, a little grainy hops. Taste is well rouded fresh citric sourness with some fruity sweetness. Slightly sparkly mouthfeel, but with little bubbles. Still easy to drink. Some uncanny citrus pips in the finish, which I dont like that much. Still decent.","GERMANY","Ritzn"

3301,"2016-09-25",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2017 Growler from the brewery, many thanks jonas! Hazy yellow color with big frothy white head. Aroma is citrusy, a bit apples, bready malts, juicy, some yeasts. Taste is juicy citrusy, grassy, biscuity, some honey, bready, incredibly balanced and lecker. Low natural carbonation, chewy mouthfeel. Similar to the Jahrhundert from the Holzfass - they?re both masterfully crafted. A beautiful and unpretentious beer. Jonas says this was more sulphuric a few hours ago.
Tap from the tank at the Zwicklbiertag. More milky, sulphuric, green than the growler version. But excellent!","Garching b. München, GERMANY","SinH4"

Growler ( filled 1/17): Great: The hayish and slightly piney hops do harmonize very well with the malty and a bit yeasty finish. Absolutely moreish...","Bochum, Porúří, GERMANY","pivnizub"
3301,"2014-12-12",3.9,"This is basically the Jahrundert Bier, unfiltered, right off the lagering cask at brewery tour. Delicacy.

Intense Golden color [cloudy] big [enormous] creamy white head, plenty of lacing. Very malty aroma due to relatively high gravity, white bread, floral noble hallertau hops. Cookies in hte beginning leading to a leafy hops bitterness. Taste is well balanced. Body medium to full, an helles couldny be thicker than this. Finish is aromatic, refreshing, hoppy with hints of honey. High carbonation.
Smooth, malty, still rather dry, alcohol shows his presence. Excellent hell on steroids.","ITALY","JaKeAFC"
