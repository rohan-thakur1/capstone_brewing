625,"2015-11-15",3.7,"Solid beer. Dark cola looking beer with an off-white head. Strong aromas of roasted coffee. Tastes of dark coffee, cacao nibs, and some hints of sweet vanilla. Sweet, lactic finish. Oily mouth feel yet very smooth and velvety. Not as sweet as I expected but quite enjoyable.","Florida, USA","ExpendableHero"

625,"2015-11-05",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 11, 2015 On tap at Epcot during F&W Fest 2015. Dark brown with thin beige head. Great coffee aroma with lots of cream and sugar, kinda like a Starbucks Frappucinno. Taste the same with lots of coffee aftertaste, mouthfeel really creamy. Carbonation low. Overall very good beer that kinda taste like fresh french vanilla coffee.","Laval, CANADA","AwaKe"
625,"2015-10-04",3.7,"Tap at Epcot. Brownish black pour. Huge espresso and vanilla nose, slightly oily aroma. Smooth malt body, not heavy with lots of vanilla and coffee taste. Good brew.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
625,"2013-05-23",4.3,"Draft at Funky Buddha. Snifter. Pours a jet black opaque with a caramel color medium head. Decent lacing throughout. Aroma of coffee (espresso), chocolate, and vanilla bean. Taste is mostly bitter coffee up front, creamy vanilla on the back end and a finish of velvety chocolate. The espresso flavor stays with you for the aftertaste. Better as it warms. Mouth is mostly very smooth and creamy. OH SO GOOD!!","Boca Raton, Florida, USA","Fritz123"

625,"2011-08-09",4.0,"Sampled at the Funky Buddha in February 2011.  I am still thinking about this beer.  Pours a dark sweet stout brown with an off-white head.  Nose is some roast, lactose, chocolate, coffee, oreo cookies, vanilla, and cafe com leche.  Flavor is similar- like oreo cookies with coffee and vanilla.  Very enjoyable and light to medium in body.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"

625,"2011-06-07",3.9,"Dark brown with a reddish tint.  The first thing that hits you is fresh roasted coffee that tails off into sweet vanilla, I dont get much else as far as aroma.  On the lighter side of medium bodied.  The flavor, once again I get the coffee up front and vanilla in the finish, if i look hard I might get some toffee and a hint of cotton candy.  The name says it all on this one.","USA","Slimbrundage"
625,"2011-06-04",4.0,"Thanks to Casy for this... dark  brown pour with a light tan head... the nose is strong roasted coffee with tons of vanilla, the vanilla notes are awesome... the taste is equally nice, perfect coffee and the vanilla is true to what its supposed to be, not generic at all, roasted vanilla coffee... recommend","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

625,"2011-01-18",4.4,"On draft at The Buddha. Thanks to Kevin at the Buddha for letting me taste some of this beautiful beer. Dark color with a thin bubbly white head. Aroma is full of coffee with hints of vanilla. The flavor is pretty much like the regular piti porter but with a slight vanilla flavor on the back end. This is an incredible treatment of the Piti Porter.",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"
625,"2010-12-09",3.7,"Growler  Pours dark brown with a brief, small, creamy, beige head. The nose presents coffee, chocolate and vanilla with the slightest suggestion of asparagus. Im fighting a severe cold and my sniffer, although clear, isnt in top-notch shape. Its possible I interpreted some of that acrid, very earthy coffee as asparagus. Medium-bodied with a skim-milk mouthfeel and modest carbonation. The flavor is sweet and chocolaty with a splash of espresso and some very nice vanilla. Sweet mocha finish. Give me more vanilla!

625,"2010-12-09",4.5,"What an amazing beer this one is. Totally unexpected since I wasnt even aware they were doing this treatment. The stages of flavor in this beer are so well defined, there is no muddiness to the flavor and everything is in perfect balance. The only thing lacking is the nose, in that the espresso dominates and aside from some light nut and chocolate you get no vanilla. Flavor profile starts off with chocolate covered nuts and moves into heavy espresso roast in the middle and finishes out with a sweet lingering vanilla aftertaste. I love vanilla so its no suprise I love this, but I was just really impressed with how well this was done. Best beer from the Buddha so far!","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
