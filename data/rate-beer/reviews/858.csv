Alcohol is very noticeable, but that is to be expected and it isnt excessive for what it is. Best sake Ive had to date.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"

Great warmth with a small alcohol bitter bite on the finish.  Silky smooth medium bodied that drys and seems to fold away.  Man I love Sake.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
858,"2008-05-13",3.7,"This has a nice nose as well, rich citrus fruits, and some fresh orchids.  Almost picking up some ripe red fruits on the palate, as well as a little bit of spice.  This is definitely more elegant than others I have tried.  Great acidity, and extremely smooth mouthfeel.  Very well done!","Gulf Shores, Alabama, USA","BlackDonald"

858,"2008-02-13",4.1,"Label says 16% ABV.  Pours a crystal clear yellowish tint that could pass for a very light Sauvignon Blanc.  A swirl of the still body reveals syrupy legs that droop slowly down the glass.  The aroma is very creamy and sweet, with notes of rice pudding, koji, and lightly fumy limoncello.  There is also a strong floral presence that lends a very calming effect.  The incredibly smooth, silky body distributes creamy lemon chiffon flavors evenly across the tongue.  Vanilla makes its presence known, and fits perfectly into the fold.  Finishes short and sweet.  This is an excellent sake.  Very enjoyable.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
858,"2008-02-01",3.6,"This pretty blue bottled sake from a bottle shop poured a small sized head of frothy medium sized clear colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a clear yet yellow hued body. The smooth aroma had a slight licorice note. The semi-thick mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a mild alcohol burn. The flavor contained notes of alcohol and licorice. Delicious and one I would certainly buy again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
