1928,"2016-12-26",3.2,"Rated on 9-30-2016 at Black Dog Pub, Fort Wayne, IN. (Draft) When served, the appearance is a small fizzy white head that is mostly lasting, lightly hazy pale yellow body, no visible carbonation noted, and a good amount of lacing. The aroma is light citrus hops, some fruit and sweet. The flavor mimics the aroma. The mouthfeel is smooth and this beer is light-medium bodied. This is an easy drinking beer but nothing really special about it stands out. It is not one of the better Dogfish Head beers that I have drank/rated.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"

1928,"2014-08-23",3.8,"20140823 Tap (growler) from State Line. This was a pleasant surprise. I asked for a sample and because the tap was next to some other pils, after my jello-shot sample of the stuff, I asked the young man if hed poured the right beer. This one seems out of place in the DFH lineup, with little of their house character, and plenty of clean and lovely marris otter malts. It is delightfully sweet, yet clean and crisp: saltines and raw white corn. The hops are soft and give the mildest ambrosia and hay-like dryness. the beer itself is a hazed pale golden with small but lingering white wisps that stick. Absolutely pleasant surprise, and perhaps overrated as a result, but Id buy this regularly by the 12 pack in cans.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

The Firefly poured a straw color with a decent-sized off-white head. The nose was bold and spicy some citrus notes.

1928,"2014-06-11",3.3,"Reviewed from notes. Consumed last April at the Rehoboth brewpub. 
It was served in a pint glass. 
The appearance was a nice light to somewhat hazy golden yellow to orange color. The bar pour didnt allow too much head but once the beer went down the lacing looked pretty nice as it trickled for the most part. 
The smell had a nice blend of sweet citrus fruits and allowed the normal amount of English pale malts to amplify a smooth take on the style. 
The taste was mainly sweet but light.
On the palate, this one sits about a light to medium with a decent sessionability running about it. The carbonation seems appropriately matched for the style as it shows a decent harshness but not overbearing. 
Overall, I say this was a pretty good English Pale Ale that went excellent with the Reuben I had.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

1928,"2012-09-16",3.5,"[BB] Lightly hazy golden color with a medium sized, white head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of floral hops, citrus, tea leaf, lemon, and toasted malts. Taste of citrus, lemon, herbal, and a grassy bitterness. Calypso seems similar to Sorachi.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
1928,"2012-08-01",3.0,"Light pale ale that wasnt particularly distinguishable from many others.  Barely hoppy, not much body, and little character to the malt.  Its fine as a summer beer, but not remarkable.","Bethesda, Maryland, USA","dbarnold"
1928,"2012-07-30",3.7,"Solid English pale with a nice delicate mix of the sweet British style malty edge and hops that add a nice bitterness but smooth things out. I sipped this quite a bit out of my wifes glass at Rehoboth. Some apple fruit  tones in flavor. A bit onnthe wet side as far as pallatte but perfect for 100 degree days in Delaware. Decent carbonation dries it out on the end.","East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","JFURYCAT"
1928,"2012-07-30",3.3,"Location/Date:Draft in Rehoboth on July 27th, 2012.
Appearance: Pours a clear gold. 
Aroma: Light citrus.
Taste: Light bitterness, some smalt.
Palate:Light body.
Summary: I cant believe they poured 11,000 pints any nobody added it to Ratebeer. I also am the first rater.  This was a solid Pale Ale, I wish I knew what to look for with the American Calypso hops, but overall a decent pale ale but not too aggresive.","Maryland, USA","jcos"
