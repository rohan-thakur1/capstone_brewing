4256,"2017-04-24",3.8,"Poured from a bottle over in Sydney. Nice golden colour, very carbonated, head fades. Strangely, Im not getting much in the way of aroma - a little bit of custardy sweetness but thats about it. Taste is straight away white grape, sauvignon blanc, hay. Comes on very bitter but not overwhelming. This really is a mashup of beer and wine, and the results are great. Very drinkable beer, while being interesting, too.

grapefruit notes. Dry resiny grapefruit taste with spicy herbal grape
notes. Mid-bodied. Mild, soft mouthfeel. Dryish resiny gooseberry

4256,"2014-12-13",3.6,"65cl bottle shared by Arve_Christian - thanks a lot! Pours clear golden with a white head. Surprisingly vinous aroma of white wine grapes, some herbal notes, mild grassy and malty with hints of sour fruits. Surprisingly grape dominated flavour, but well balanced and with a nice acidity and bitterness. Tasty one!","Tallinn, ESTONIA","visionthing"
4256,"2014-12-13",4.0,"On bottle from Vinmonopolet Hasle. Clear golden color,ok foam. Medium aroma intensity; very fruity, distinct grape ( the Sauvignon Blanc), some citrus. Medium body & complexity. SOme bitterness, balances very well. Very enjoyable- but of course Sauvignon Blanc is my favorite white wine grape","Oslo, NORWAY","Arve_Christian"
4256,"2014-11-22",4.0,"Bottle from Vika enjoyed at home
Pours golden clear with a creamy white head. Smell of sauvignon blanc grapes, fruity white wine aromas, spicy hops, light malts. Very refreshing. Moderate sweet, sauvignon grapes, some hints of acids, quite fruity, hints of spices and herbs, light malts, hints of grass. Moderate to medium bitter finish, some nice grassy and herbal tendensies. This beer sure is a blast. What a good idea to mix a nelson sauvin pilsener with the actual sauvignon grapes! It gets the best of two worlds. Should be a winner in the summer; and probably very good with sea food. Recommended","NORWAY","esp0r"

4256,"2014-10-26",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 16, 2016 Okay so I dont like lager but... Typical of GP, this a high quality brew and a fine drink - not at all cloying - a rich, fuller bodied, more complex and tasty pilsner with its own character. Very Sauv Blanc-ish.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","Hop_Hedonist"

4256,"2014-10-12",3.7,"Enjoyed at the 2014 Firestone Walker Invitational. It looks and smells like a pils, with a clear golden hue and peppery Czech hop aroma, but thats where similarities end. Wine grapes permeate the flavor, though the bitter hops and pale malt lend a snappy pilsner finish. Very tasty, very drinkable.","","PartyFowle"

4256,"2014-07-29",3.8,"Golden colour with a 1 finger white head. Sauvignon blanc notes are immediately apparent, along with citrus and pine.

4256,"2014-05-18",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 15, 2016 A brilliant beer that combines the crisp clean taste of a pilsner on the grain side with the similarly crisp clean taste of a Sav-blanc on the grape side. A different brew that ticks most of my aroma/taste boxes.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","beer-yum"
4256,"2014-04-22",4.1,"Bottle from Beervana 2013. Pale yellow-straw, fine white head, very fruity aroma, passionfruit, grape juice, apple, amazing fruity flavours, sweet but with a really well balanced bitterness, delicate and light but dry grassy bitterness, residual sweetness, light body, slightly sticky texture. Amazingly complex, very nice.","AUSTRALIA","ShaneJ"
4256,"2013-10-04",4.1,"For a not bitter beer this certainly has a bang of hops in it, no mistaking the grassy notes, but theyre a little magical in the delivery, this is altogether a bit clever. It carries a long soft bitter note but has a wonderfully moorish over-riding sweetness. Im lost to describe just how soft and welcome on the palate this is, its really good and youll kick yourself for missing it.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","Pdubyah"
4256,"2013-10-04",3.6,"Look is a pils heaven. Aroma is nelson sauvin hops galore! Taste is tangy bitterness with hoppy pils tang. Pretty intense and complex, but not to my palate. Overall, another interesting and drinkable brew from Garage Project.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","stoutnick"
4256,"2013-09-23",4.0,"Bottle from mane liquor. Pours a light straw yellow with no head. Nose is full of sav blanc!! Citric and grassy hop driven.

4256,"2013-09-06",3.5,"Pours gold with a fading head.
Nose shows potent Nelson passion fruit notes along with some cookie dough characters. Interesting stuff.
Similar flavours, big Nelson hop characters. Not much malt but there is a faint fruity sweetness. Finishes very dry and bitter. Almost sharp.
Carbonation could be a little higher.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Davros"
4256,"2013-09-02",4.3,"Bottle from Slowbeer. Pours golden yellow with a light, fluffy white head. Immediate pungent tropical fruit aromas - mango, passionfruit, kiwifruit with a hit of buttery resin. A light floral malt profile backed by a big white grape acidic sweet aroma. Taste is really smooth. Crisp floral and tropical notes carried by huge sauv blanc grape flavours, once again with sweet acidity. The wine hit isnt too sharp, but really adds some complexity to what tastes like a fucking good pilsner. Awesome beer.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","HopRedHead"

4256,"2013-07-28",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2013 ReRate after drinking 3rd bottle (oh, lucky me): Dunno whether its because I have a cleaner palate this time or whether this bottle is a bit long in the tooth, but the grape notes are a lot more to the fore this time, and the rich pilly notes of the first and second bottle are a bit more back seat. Slight spiciness and woodiness at the finish. Im actually sticking my little finger out as I drink this; I feel so, er, refined or sumsuch. Original Post: Look, Im not a polite fellow, and I normally only drink wine to be polite, so I know next to nothing about wine. Imagine my slight lack of enthusiasm when I cracked this ""wine-beer"" and sucked the smoke into my nostrils. First up, a hit of floral and fruity hops. Immediately subsumed by classic pilsner notes. I picked out some grape notes sneaking out through the pilsner, but as soon as I noticed them they would disappear, in a flash, into the malt pillow. Taste, at first, was like the aroma: a delicious, perfectly balanced pilsener with something fattening up the middle and a sharp, puckery aftertaste. Thats where I could really pick out the grape notes. Then, as the beer warmed and my palate adjusted, it all melded into one awesome pilsner. Its not a wine, its a beer. It held its flavour for as long as it took me to drink the bottle. Not only one of the best pilsners Ive ever had, but one of the best beers. Amen.","North Shore, Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","DylansDad"
4256,"2013-07-23",3.0,"A wine made like a beer? A beer made with wine? Whatever. Its interesting; sharp and bitter - the cat piss on a gooseberry bush characteristic of sav blanc is right there, front and centre, but the sweetness and funkiness of the beer side of this brew comes through strongly, ending almost in a Belgian fashion. Interesting.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","buzz_and_hum"
4256,"2013-07-03",3.1,"2013 vintage (which was a great wine vintage in NZ). Predominately pilsner on the nose with subtle grassy sauvignon blanc undertones. Pours very clean with little head. On the palate the sauv come through a bit more with a bit of acidity. Once again a nicely presented package and hopefully they make this again as I question adding beers when in reality they will not get to ten ratings due to the very small production run.","NEW ZEALAND","omega"
