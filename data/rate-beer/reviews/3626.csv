Citrusy hops build peppery bitterness, as subtle caramel and peaches create balance.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy sheet of foam settles atop the misty amber blond.
-The nose is nicely delicate, which doesnt really fit with the beers name.
-All flavours are well leveled.
-There is some hay in the malt flavors.
-The mouthfeel is lean and drinkability very high.
