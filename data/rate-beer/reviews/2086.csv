2086,"2004-12-09",4.3,"This beer poured a rich reddish brown w/ orange highlights and ok head w/ slight lacing.  Bananas and hazelnuts dominated the nose, while soury fermented fruit, grapefruit, and banana sweetness appeared in the mouth.  I found this beer to be dry on the palate and smooth, it coats the mouth.","San Diego, California, USA","Hairofthedog"

Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
2086,"2004-12-05",3.0,"At the Pizza Port Strong Ale Festival.  The first thing I noticed about this was that there was a minty/medicinal nose to it, which I didnt much care for.  There was a LOT of spice in the nose, which was interesting, but i guess it just threw me.  Other than that, this was very interesting indeed, wonderful spice flavor and a nice sweetness to the whole thing.  Aftertaste was the same.","Seattle, Washington, USA","joshpiledean"
2086,"2004-12-05",4.0,"Dark amber almost copper colored brew. Spicy nose. Clove seems to be one of the added spices. Sweet but well balanced with the spice. Another great brew from this brewer!","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"

2086,"2004-12-04",4.1,"Holy smokes.  Such an interesting beer.  Highlight of Strong Ale festival here.  Aroma and flavor were both very intriguing lemon and manrarin orange.  Cant remember much, but this stuff is damn good!","Huntington Beach, California, USA","jonwell"
2086,"2004-10-15",3.2,"UPDATED: NOV 6, 2004 Draught at Lucky Baldwins, Pasadena 
Murky brown in colour with a modest tan head. Sweet malty aroma with plenty of fruit and spice in the nose.  Thick, rich complex flavor with a bevy of fruit and spice. I drank this with chicken curry and the spice and flavor still managed to shine through. Nutmeg, cinnamon, clove. Some interesting fruit notes as well with a bit of grape skin astringentcy.","Lancaster, California, USA","Sven"
2086,"2004-10-04",3.7,"Light, sweet flavors of fruit, spices and flowers. Very smooth with the 8% ABV not detected. This was delicious, I wish Craftsman would bottle their beers!","L.A., California, USA","BigBastard"
2086,"2004-09-28",4.0,"Pours a hazy amber color with a thick creamy tan colored head.  The nose has a spicy note of clove to it that is joined by a nice malty background component, both of which make sure that they are not passed by.  The beer has a medium-bodied fullness to it, at least for a Bier De Garde.  The taste is quite spicy, I get notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, clove (dominant), and a certain sweet component to it.  There is a bit of fruitiness here as well that reminds me of apples, plums, and raisins.  This is definitely interesting, and I like how the fruitiness mixes with the spices, made more remarkable by the fact that there is only supposed to be a bit of rosemary in here as far as spices go.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
