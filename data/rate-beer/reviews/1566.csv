1566,"2013-12-15",3.8,"Bottle, purchased in Japan, 12/14/2013. Clear pour, light golden sheen apparent. Aroma is honeysuckle, rich melon, peach flesh, tropical candy sweetness, with a clean fresh finish. Taste is lightly fruity, not as heavy as the nose suggests, pear and melon, with clean rice mid-palate, anise finish. Silky body, touch of heat lingering on the breath. Lovely, nice and balanced.","New York, USA","jbeatty"

1566,"2004-09-19",3.8,"RBSG Portland 2004.  Virtually colorless. Aroma of flowers, grain, white peach, pumpkin, pear. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic. Light to medium body, watery texture, flat carbonation, moderately alcoholic. One of the few attractive and enjoyable sakes Ive tried (though I havent tried too many, especially in the upper tier; the typical aroma/flavor profile in sake doesnt appeal to me much, so Id sooner put $50 into a red wine).  Nice balance and pleasant aroma. Domo arigato to Jordan for letting me sample some of this!","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
