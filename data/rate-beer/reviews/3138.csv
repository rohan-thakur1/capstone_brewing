3138,"2017-06-11",3.9,"Bouteille 37.5cl, de et partagée avec Pierre T. Anno 2015.
Orange/cuivre, col beige blanc-cassé retombant rapidement.
Arôme au nez parfumé mettant bien en avant la cerise, le tout donne de fines effluves de funk avec un effet grains en rétro, retrouve des notes de boisé/foudre avec un côté rappelant un peu une veille brune et une pointe de caramélisé. Nez oscillant sur une Kriek Cantillon fraiche. 
Palais est plaisant, fruité avec un effet de griotte/Balaton qui procurent de belles notes aigrelettes, le tout,ce pendant, sous couvert dune petite douceur. Retrouve un élément tannique de la peau avec un effet vinaigre léger, séloignant ainsi de la marque de fabriquent de pas mal de brasseurs US.
Sécheresse en bouche avec effet de chêne et foudre, le tout finement aigre, sharp au niveau du fruité cerise en toute fin de bouche.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
3138,"2017-05-29",4.2,"(375ml 2015 bottle from kihoskh.dk) Pours a lightly hazed pink-tinged deep orange with a small but lasting white ring of bubbles and spotty lace. Aroma of bright sour cherries, cherry pit notes of almonds and cinnamon, quite tart, a little lemon, touches of funk and some soft oaky notes. Flavour is rather tart, lots of fairly bright sour cherry flesh, lemon zest, subtle acetic notes, fairly woody, lightly spiced with those cinnamon notes again towards the finish, a bit of almond in the finish as well, funk is extremely restrained. Hints of sweetness at times, a dry finish, lingering notes of cherry skins and spice. Medium bodied, light carbonation. Very nice, best of the handful of their beers Ive tried.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"
3138,"2017-05-29",4.0,"Pours a cloudy, dark amber colored beer with a flimsy, immediately disappearing head.

Smells of flowery, sugary sherry with a mellow stone pith quality, gently embraced by a well nuanced tartness. 

Tastes way more intense than the nose indicated, with a challenging, enjoyable flavor profile ranging from sweet to sour, while finishing sweet again, this time with a nice earthen quality to it. Turns quite sour, acidic, with a sparkly effervescence during mid palate, providing a nice softness on the palate overall. 

Tastes of sugared candy cherries, which turn immediately sour, once a lemon pulp sourness enters the palate. This leads to an almost tongue numbing intensity in terms of the sourness level, while the cherry never vanishes entirely from the flavors. Develops a short aqueous softness, moving away from the powerful sour punch, inviting a much more fragile and complex cherry goodness to unfold. Scented wood, cherry flowers, sunshine and ripe cherry pulp mingle together and establish a late, marvelous taste peak in this. The finish is soft and calm, long lasting with just a sour note.

Very well made AWA, pushing the boundaries as for its luscious cherry richness. Fruity sweet, at no point artificial or jam-like, this simply makes a lot of fun to drink. Its refreshing, rewarding and versatile with a very nice balance to it.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3138,"2016-12-10",4.1,"Bár nem vagyok egy fanyarság-fetisiszta, erre a főzetre kíváncsi voltam, s ha már a Prairie érintettsége közvetetten jelen van, valószínűleg nem nagyon lesz itt mellényúlás. Az aromák súlyáról szinte a kinézetet megelőzően kell beszélni, mivel a kitöltést követően azonnal arcul csapnak a fanyar illatnyalábok, az erősen savas, éretlen trópusi gyümölcsök fűszeres mondanivalója igencsak kikívánkozik a pohárból. Rosé színű teste alól cikázva röpködnek fel a meggyes, marcipános, szilvabefőttes, fahéjas aromák, részletgazdag, tartalmas és robbanékony, egy kevés lószőrrel megbolondított, amolyan kandalló tüze mellé vizionált, kenhető, pokrócos jegyek. Nem az a metsző savanyúság, igen simulékony a karakter, melyben a savas jelleg nem feltétlenül írja felül a gyümölcsös komponensek jelenlétét. A fanyar szilva, fahéj, a meggy jellege itt is uralja a vibráló terepet, a brettes szerkezetben a gyümölcsös él mentén egy halovány marhahúsos, vad színezet, s egy puha, hordós karakter is feloldódik. Igen összetett, érezhetően mély tartalom, talán túlságosan is az egy fanyar sörökkel csak ismerkedő kóstoló számára.

3138,"2016-10-01",4.9,"Poured from 375ml green bottle. Had a off white head and poured a pinkish red. Smell was overload of cherries that smacks you in the face with a left hook. Taste is a excellent tart sour cherry that puckers up your mouth on the back of your tongue. Cant wait for more.","Kansas, USA","GrandaddyKC"

3138,"2016-10-01",4.0,"Bottle shared by Brandon. Pour is near gold with a pink tinge. Minimal head. Aroma is light funk and light lacto with a clean cherry note. Flavor is tart up front with evolution to light spicy cherry and sweetness with lingering tartness in the finish. A bit more body would be nice but that is really getting picky. This is really nice.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"
3138,"2016-09-28",4.1,"(375ml bottle) clearish light pink/deep gold, soapy white bubbles. Nose of cinnamon, cherry pie filling, vanilla, pie crust. Taste of vanilla, medium tart cherry, not overwhelming fruit flavor but nice and balanced, touch of pie dough, medium tartness, linger of tart fruit but not overwhelming on the cherry.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
3138,"2016-09-22",4.1,"Poured from a 375 ml bottle. 
Aroma is nice with some moderately strong cherry notes with hints of citrus and acidity. Faint oak notes with some cherry pit character. Light tannins form the skins of the fruit. Faint tropical fruit. 
Pours a hazy, bright amber color with some golden hues and a medium sized, medium thick, slightly off white head that recedes quickly to the edges where it lingers slightly. 
Flavor is slightly to moderately acidic, but not sharp at all with a medium light sweetness to it. Light lemon notes with a bit more acidity as it warms as well as a touch of pineapple. Faint oak. Moderate cherry notes with some pit and skin character. Some light tannins. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, anotther nice beer from ASS. Im not sure if I like this or the base beer more, but seem equally nice. The fruit notes in this beer are really well balanced and not overpowering at all.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3138,"2016-09-14",4.5,"Tap/375 bottle: cloudy pink pour, very little head. Bright cherry aroma, acidic. Spiced. Prickly mouthfeel despite lack of carbonation. Tastes like sour cherry pie. Cherry, cinnamon, slightly bready.
Lingering tart finish.
Fantastic.","Arkansas, USA","gerby23"
3138,"2016-09-13",4.2,"375 ml bottle. The beer is a medium light amber lightly shaded with a pinkish red color. Smallish, fizzy head, amber-pinkish in color. Dissipates pretty quickly. No lacing. Fresh, bright cherries and cherry skins and pits in the aroma. Light vinous note. Solid oak adds a little vanilla. Maybe some cider action at the edges, but not too bad. Fairly light funk depth but its there and makes me curious about how the beer will age and the brewerys funk will develop with time. Lots of cherry juice, though. A touch of spice. Definite woody cinnamon when you go looking for it. Taste is straight cherry juice up front. Funk depth is still lacking somewhat but whats there is promising. The cherry juice is backed by a surprisingly gentle acidity. This is a fruity juicy sour but not an aggressive one. This is not going to strip the enamel from your teeth at all. Some cherry pie and vanilla sweetness at first, but the finish is fairly dry with a light touch of oak bitterness. Light body with some tanginess to it. The effervescent carbonation settles pretty quickly. Very nice beer. Nails the fruit and the funk will come with time. Well, American Solera is two for two in my book, so far.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
3138,"2016-09-10",4.1,"On tap at the brewery. Comes a pale red with a small white head. Aroma of cherries, wood, and funk. Taste is tart cherries, oak, and funk. Delicious.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
3138,"2016-09-08",4.2,"Bottle. Pours a cloudy pink with small off white head that diminishes to nothing. The aroma is strong sweet cherry, oak, funk. Thin body, funky, cherry pith, nice tartness, really enjoyed this.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3138,"2016-09-01",4.7,"Enjoyed this beautiful beer at the American Solera members party last weekend. Beautiful bright reddish pink color, minimal head retention which is expected for the style. Aroma is cherry pie! Mouthfeel is like a bubbly champagne. Taste is phenomenal at 55 to 60 you get straight sour cherry pie. Very happy to be a member of American Solera Society.","","OKBeerFan"
3138,"2016-09-01",4.3,"This is a really refreshing brewing. The color is like a cherry spritzer. It is dry and has a lingering taste, but is not cloying. I get heavy cherry skin with a great amount of tartness. The best advice I can give is to allow it to warm, you then get some sweet pie filling with cinnamon. Im holding on to a few of these to see how it ages.","Austin, Texas, USA","texascheesemonge"
3138,"2016-08-21",4.0,"Bottle at Culmination Fest 16: Poured a orange with pink haze, head was white. Aroma is sour pungent cherries and oak. Taste is similar with tart cherries, light spice, sourness, and dry finish.","Wasilla, Alaska, USA","SHIG"
