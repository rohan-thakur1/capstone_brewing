 Cola-dark brown liquid allows a haughtily manhandled sandy-beige flour-clump to perch atop as burnt bread, walnuts, sorghum molasses, toasted dates, blueberry leaves, used medium-roast coffee grounds, and sweat aromas erupt from within to a greater, visibly interested audience. 
 Good charcoal balance. A little fiery by its hot mid-palate. Almond milk chocolately sultriness accompanied with just-hit bong water, grilled apples, birch bark, and graham flour experienced most prominently at swallow. Menacingly swishable, and deadly. After the fourth swig I was feeling unquestionably hammered.

Taste: Dark roasted malt dominates, with a strong coffee bean and dark chocolate flavor. Light caramel and toffee in the background. Bitterness is moderate, just enough to balance the maltiness.

Finish: Dry, with dark roast and chocolate prominent and touch of astringency. 
Overall: Good robust Porter, heavier on the roast/coffee character than most other versions. Thankfully, the roast character isnt overly astringent. Caramel and toffee undertones balance out the sharp and bitter roast.","","TH28"

The aroma is big on light chocolate and good roasted malt. There is a little lactose in there, but for a porter, it's pretty good. The flavor starts off not very good. Way too much carbonation. There is a lot of bitter cocoa and roasted malt. There is a strange metallic aspect to a light fruit that I'm not too fond of. It's still not bad. The mouth feel isn't really good.

Vanilla and roasted coffee beans both come out of this Porters sweet flavour profile, lasting nicely well after the sip is finished.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy slab of foam tops the darkness.
-Mouthfeel is obviously quite smooth due to the nitrogen treatment, which works quite well with the level of residual sugars.
-Earthy hop resins balance out the finish.
-This is a very nice Porter for dessert lovers.

181,"2011-10-07",4.3,"Review from notes at World of Beer - Fort Myers on 9/29/11. 

Poured on draft into a snifter. 

Appearance: Pours a cola brown, almost black, with a 1 finger creamy light tan head. Excellent lacing.

Smell: Sweet and roasted malt with a touch of chocolate.

Taste: Fruity bitterness and roasted malt up front followed by chocolate in the middle before ending with hoppy bitterness and sweet malt at the finish. Aftertaste is bittersweet. Definitive CCB flavor comes through.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation.

Drinkability: Very good drinkability. The elevated ABV% would keep you from drinking multiples, but the flavor is very good.

Overall: Very good beer overall. This isnt your typical porter, so its more closely related to an imperial stout. Definitely try this one if you get the chance.","Fort Myers, Florida, USA","adam42381"

181,"2011-07-28",4.2,"Growler in a trade

thanks go out to a generous Florida trader for the unique 32 ounce growler that contained an amazing porter. Sometimes I wonder if Cigar City lives up to the hype but in this case the answer is yes. I can only hope that the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie is just as good. If it wasnt before Cigar City is now a must visit on any trip to Florida.

Aroma and appearance - Fluid and inky the body is murky like oily water. The light beige head was a soft accent. Sweet bakers chocolate, iced coffee, and fresh raspberries bite at the edge of the senses. Dark fruits and slightly overdone pie crust add a bit more depth.

Flavor and palate - Full bodied and rich the mouthfeel is strong for the style. Like frozen coffee cubes the beer melts in the mouth. Malt, bakers chocolate, coffee, and toasted white bread left a little too long in the toaster create an impression on the palate. Somehow though it is not overwhelming. Instead it strikes the perfect balance between depth and delicacy that makes it possible to polish off the growler without any troubles. Hats off to Cigar City for another home run.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

181,"2010-09-24",4.0,"Growler.  Having just tried the Jose Marti hoppy imperial porter from CCB, I can say that this is an entirely different beast....and its just as tasty in its own right.  Pouring a clear, dark mahogany color with glints of backlit reddish-brown hues, the body supports a small, swirly head of yellowish-tan foam.  Settling as a thin ring at the edge, the foam leaves smooth-edged splotches of lacing on the glass.  The nose displays excellent balance, showing rich, chocolaty, caramel brownie notes that are countered with hints of toasted and robust barley roast.  The stuff just smells damn good, and totally approachable.  Flavors follow suit, matching the aroma in depth and balance.  Choco-caramel is rich, yet sufficiently dry, never weighing things down with excess sugars.  Dark roast and toasty, nutty dessert bread notes bring things full circle.  Velvety smooth, with carbonation that is appropriately light to moderate in intensity, the palate shows grace and substance, never getting cloying or laborious.  Great, great porter.  This weighs in right behind Founders masterpiece for me.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

181,"2010-09-11",4.3,"I had the pleasure of experiencing Puppys Breath Porter on tap at Cigar City Brewing on the ninth day of September, 2010. Served in a shaker glass, notes of tart dark fruit, roastiness,  leather and a subtle charming sweetness emanated. Holding the glass up to the light quickly illustrated the impenetrability of the dark roasted hue and exhibited a deep brown nature, slightly lighter than your average Pepsi.  A short beige head followed the serving all the way to the end, leaving a thick coating of lacing behind.  The body was thick and characteristic of the style. Couple that with the gentle sweetness, bitter finish and spot on light carbonation, Puppys Breath Porter  made for a truly inspiring experience.  Delicious, nutritious, auspicious, and a few other positive adjectives  that end in ious. Cheers!","Tampa, Florida, USA","Odde"

Flavor is wonderful blend of chocolate, roast, dry roasted coffee, slight sweetness and a velvety mouthfeel.  Simply outstanding porter.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"

Full-bodied and creamy with medium carbonation. Well-balanced flavor. Very roasty with big-time espresso flanked by a nice chocolate element. Sweet mocha finish. World class porter!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

181,"2010-09-06",3.8,"9/4/10.  On tap at the brewery.  Solid black pour with red edges and a small dark tan head.  Big chalky chocolate aroma with hints of roast, reminds of a Guinness in a way.  The flavor is creamy, chalky chocolate with obvious roasted malts.  Not quite coffee, but plainly roasted.  Big creamy feel.","Georgia, USA","drowland"
181,"2010-09-03",4.0,"Jar filled up by Cigar City...  Poured dark brown -- near black -- with a light, tan head.  Lots of roast, robust aroma.  Chocolate, roasty, almonds, smoked wood, and some coffee too in the flavors.  Lots going on, but still very drinkable.  Nice bitterness that was enhanced by a molasses-like sweetness.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
