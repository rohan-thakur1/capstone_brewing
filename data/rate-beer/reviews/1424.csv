1424,"2016-08-23",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 24, 2016 Collab of Nogne O and Freigeist brewed at Vormann, intended as an imperial Alt, tasted at GBF. Irregular, moussy, pale greyish beige head over a deep brown-bronze copper coloured beer. Aroma of hazelnuts, caramel, burnt toast, smoked ham, burnt pipe tobacco, dried fig. Dried fruits in the mouth, restrainedly sweetish, very nutty malt middle with a caramelly sweetish edge but altogether on the dryish side, hayish and herbal (almost tea-like) hop bitterness in the end along with lingering toasted malt bittersweetness, the smoked meat factor returning and warming brandyish alcohol. Recognizably Alt in its core, but evidently at imperial ABV level. Altbier is seldom countered by modern craft brewers and if anyone is to do it, I guess Freigeist is the right candidate for the job. This one indeed extends the limits of the style while at the same time being conservative in keeping the typical nutty maltiness of a classic Alt intact. Beautifully done from a style and technical point of view - and a tasty beer in general.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
