Na zapleczu niewielka porcja gorzkiej czekolady. 
Jest tak poprawnie i stylowo, że aż ciężko w to uwierzyć. 
 Smak:  Dokładnie tak powinno smakować wzorowe Black IPA!
Intensywnie nachmielone Czarne Ale z gigantczną porcją ciemnych, palonych słodów. Podparte intensywną dawką iglaków z ociekającą wprost żywicą z ich kory. Ociera się wprost o absurd w swojej kremowości, gładkości na języku.
Akcenty prażonego słonecznika widoczne są jak na dłoni. W drugim rzucie wyczuwalne sugestie gorzkiej czekolady i nieziemski posmak orzechowego cappuccino, który powoduje natychmiastową chęć oblizywania się ze smakiem ;) 
Goryczka chociaż długa i dość intensywana, umiejętnie wpasowuje się w całość.
Pomimo pozornej słodyczy sam profil piwa jest wytrawny, smukły.
Piwo ma sporo ciała, oleistą, gęstą, jedwabistą kołderkę.
Z radością sięgam po kolejne łyki i obserwuje w jakim szybkim tempie to piwo znika z kielicha.
Wyborne Black IPA! Jadno z najlepszych jakie piłem. 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie na średnie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Jeśli ktoś by zapytał mnie o wzorowo skrojone Black IPA, takie które można polecić każdemu jako wyznacznik stylu, z całą pewnością poleciłbym to właśnie piwo.
Jest doskonale zbalansowane z odpowiednią porcją ciemnych słodów, stylowymi akcentami prażonego słonecznika, gorzkiej czekolady, orzechowego cappuccino. Przyprawione dużą dozą żywicy i iglaków z sosnowych lasów.
Kremowa, jedwabista tekstura, półpełne ciało i ogromna pijalność.
Dodatkowym atutem jest niska cena 11,7 PLN.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

Very nice aroma, dominated by tropical fruits (mango) and citrus notes (orange), in the background some strong, piney character. Light to medium roasted malts aroma, but definitely in the second row. When beer becomes warmer those roasted malts are more intense and noticeable (mainly coffee). Taste is medium bitter, but it quickly disappears and become more malty-semi-sweet. Medium body, creamy and slick texture, finish is semi-bitter, raw, harsh and dry. Summing up what to say, this beer is f.... fantastic. When you close the eyes its IPA, when you open black IPA.

 Tastes like a pretty near perfect version (for my taste) of a black IPA. Lots of coffee, a wee bit of choc to keep it from the too dry side and, rare indeed, the perfect amount of sticky/piney hop to hold its own handily against all that darkness. Perfect balance between burnt/sweet/bitter.
 Not over heavy on the palate for such a flavourful beer. Could easily go another one (or more if Id not only bought 2).

3979,"2013-06-20",3.7,"Darkest brown body, initially decent tan head dissipates to a ringed but lasting hoop and consistent bubbly film. I dont know if its the ABV or freshness, but I got little else but cellophane/parcel packaging with a touch of cheap coffee cream when it warmed up. 
Initial taste of weak brewed Ooolong, a small tang but a very smooth carb and slight bitterness is a wee bit disjointed - weirdly refreshing but a touch watery. Nae hops. No big palate impact for an imperial. Midway through is like a chocolate mousse, really creamy and devilishly moreish but lacking in any sweetness. Skitty bitterness on the finish, where this really salvages itself. Pacey coffee, chewy hops peek through and a wrap around of Sparking pepper linger as the CO2 holds firm.After an inauspicious start, this proved supremely drinkable. The hops are buried in a dark malt swell and took a while to work towards. Silky smooth underlayer of carbonation gives a righteous creamy mouthfeel. Theres plenty to enjoy but I wish was more frontloaded - I look forward to the other bottle in 6 months time.
