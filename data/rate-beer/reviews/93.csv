93,"2016-11-05",3.7,"Tap at the source, Warren. Pours pale dusty orange, white head and lacing. Aroma is lots of pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon nutmeg, allspice. Flavor is really nice pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, I quite like it. Nice pumpkin beer. Sort of a cola note, almost lemon-limey in a bizarre sort of way.","New York, USA","SG111"
93,"2014-10-06",3.9,"Growler... Pours hazy and dirty orange with a tiny, creamy, white head. Good retention. Opulent bouquet, consisting of graham and vanilla with loads of fresh autumn spices. Smells better than any other pumpkin beer Ive ever tried. Medium to full-bodied with lazy carbonation. Nice pumpkin pie flavor, but a bit watery and thin all the way through the lightly minerally finish. I wish the flavor lived up to the aromas promise. I cant complain much about something that smells this good and is thin, but is otherwise flawless.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
93,"2014-02-05",3.7,"Draft at the brewpub (notes). Pours a hazy deep orange color with a small off white head. The aroma has sweet brown sugar, a good amount of pumpkin and pumpkin spices, nice toasted pumpkin and squash. The flavor has pumpkin pie spices, molasses, sweet brown sugar, yeast, toasted, pumpkins, gingerbread cookies. Sweet, without being too much so.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
93,"2013-11-22",3.6,"Growler. Clear yellow pour. Pumpkin aromas. Pumpkin and mild spec notes. Decent body and mouthfeel.","Florida, USA","50belair"
93,"2013-11-14",3.9,"Draft at kuhnhenn event at torst with Andrew and Andy. Pours an orange amber body with thin white lacing. Aroma is perfect pumpkin pie drizzled with cinnamon and apple sauce. Mouthfeel is super light almost vapors the flavor away. Still strong cinnamon and crust in the finish.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
93,"2013-11-14",4.1,"Poured a pumpkin orange, no head or lacing

Smell is predominantly cinnamon where as the taste is thanksgiving spice with a lot of pumpkin. Great seasonal and reflection of a pumpkin ale","NYC, New York, USA","Godofthecellar"
93,"2013-11-04",3.8,"On tap at the brewery. Smells and taste like pumpkin pie. Lots of cinnamon. Really good pumpkin.","Michigan, USA","SpongeRuiner"
93,"2013-11-01",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2014 Tap: Opaque & turbid orange, like a liquid pumpkin with a khaki colored foam that softs rests on top of the brew. Aroma contains many of the spices that are expected; cinnamon, ginger, & light nutmeg being the most stand-out. However the aroma seems sweeter than other pumpkin ales Ive had... like an underlying, condensed milk sweetness. The taste agrees, with cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, bready malt, light graham cracker, & a resilient residual, brown sugary sweetness aspect that pushes this beer into ""pumpkin pie"" territory without getting too cloying. Large formats could wear you down, but smaller samples are quite nice. One of my top local autumn choices.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
93,"2013-10-25",4.2,"Very tasty pumpkin ale. Clean, non-abrasive spice like other pumpkin beers. On tap pours orange with a frothy cream head. Aroma of fresh pumpkin annutmeg. Light body, nice pumpkin brown sugar taste without the bitter finish. Great stuff.","Michigan, USA","BlowOffTube"
93,"2012-12-29",3.3,"Growler shared thanks to Dave...thanks man. Pours out a moderate amber color with a small off white head. Aroma is of sweet creamy pumpkin and light spices. Taste is light pumpkin spices, sweet malty notes, some vanilla, sugar and light spice in the finish. Overall solid, but nothing that makes it jump out.","Ocean County, New Jersey, USA","pineypower"
93,"2012-12-15",3.3,"Growler via growler swap part awesome. Poured a good looking clear burnt orange body with a full frothy off white head. Aroma is eartyhy pumpkin pulp with some light brown sugar and all spice, medium toast. Medium to full boided with average but lively carbonation that fills your mouth nicely and has a lingering carbonation tingle. Flavor falls a little flat. The pupkin notes are not really making themself known nor are the spices. What is left seem like an aber ale with a touch of spice in the background. Not my favorite Kuhnhenn or pumpkin beer by any means but I do appreciate the growler and giving me a chance to try it, thanks mikem409.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
93,"2012-11-18",3.9,"At the brewery, dark orange pour, small white head.  Aroma of brown sugar and a little pumpkin.  Taste is good with some brown sugar and cinnamon.  Pumpkin is present enough.  A good brew.","Chandler, Arizona, USA","JPDurden24"
93,"2012-11-12",2.8,"Sample draft at the brewery.  Pours a clear light orange color with almost no head.  Aroma is faint, light pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon and honey.  Taste has a decent pumpkin pie taste but it seems very watered down.  Disappointing for a 7% beer.  Very thin and watery mouthfeel.  Ive had many better pumpkin beers.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
93,"2012-11-11",3.6,"Draft. Pours a nice amber. The aroma is strong of pumpkin and nutmeg. The taste is really good. Probably the best pumpkin beer that I have had. The brown sugar help balances it.

93,"2012-11-10",4.1,"Inviting pumpkin pie nose, lots of squash, some toasty malts, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Orange pour, average head and retention.  Excellent balance of spice, pumpkin and malt in the flavor.  Very smooth, easily one of the best pumpkin beers Ive had.","Iowa, USA","ekoerper"
93,"2012-11-07",3.4,"Pours clear amber/orange with a medium tan head.  Aroma has crust and pumpkin with spices...pielike but mild.  Flavor has some earthy hops, lt spice, dry leaves, and notes of brown sugar and pumpkin.  Mouthfeel is lt/medium and the finish is spiced, hoppy, and dry.  Good but too subtle and subdued.","The dub c, Pennsylvania, USA","reggiedunlop"
93,"2012-10-30",3.8,"Growler thanks to MikeM !  Pours a rich copper color with a finger of eggshell foam.  Aromas are sweet spice, rich malt and a bit of pumpkin. On the palate it is a lot of the same with cinnamon being the most dominant flavor but its kept in check with a big full body pumpkin malt laced mid palate that is sweet but quite drinkable. It taste like it should be heavy and sticky but it has a pretty clean finish with big red gum notes that replace the hop bitterness with spicy cinnamon. Well done.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
93,"2012-05-28",4.2,"Growler.  Pours orange.  Aromas of fresh pumpkin pie.  Flavor is insane.  Rich pumpkin spice,  wonderful pumpkin and lactose.  Love it.  Traded for 2 growlers it was so good.","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"
93,"2011-11-26",3.4,"On tap at Kuhnhenn. Poured an orange color with a small sized head. Lots of spices - cinnamon (Big Red Gum). Pumpkin in there too, but heavy on the spice side (I prefer my pumpkin beers the other way...heavier on Pumpkin).","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
93,"2011-11-09",3.2,"growler... medium clarity on a dark orange, light tan ring forms... the aroma is  a bit of plastic, an infected peanut butter note, and fresh pumpkins, amazingly pumpkin beer that doesnt have a dominating spice note... the taste is all pumpkin, a bit of nutmeg, if youre looking for all pumpkin in a beer without the accents then grab this one","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

93,"2010-11-24",3.8,"Tap at hopcat. Orangish red pour. Minimal off white head. Aroma of burnt pumpkin, sweet potato, nutmeg and cream cheese frosting. Simply amazing and unique. Flavor of a cinnamon roll, pumpkin pie, burnt marshmallow, and raisin. Very impressive. Glad I had it.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","badnewsbeers"
93,"2010-11-01",3.9,"Outstanding pumpkin, enjoyed on tap at the brewpub with one of the Kuhnhenn ""boys"". Thick orange coloured body, lacey. Nutmeg and spicey aroma.Carbonation appropriate and right there. Nice balance and a nutritious lunch by itself.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
93,"2010-10-24",2.7,"Sampled from the tap at the 2010 MBG Fall Fest. Poured a cloudy orange with a near white head that dissipated to the edges. Aroma had tons of spice with cinnamon and brown sugar really coming through. A lot of apple as well, it really smelled similar to apple cider. Flavor was really sweet from the brown sugar with lots of spice that overwhelmed the after taste. Pumpkin really never came out in this beer and was overly sweet and spiced for my liking.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
93,"2010-02-22",3.7,"Tap @ Blind Tiger.  Poured a hazy deep golden orange color with a cream colored head.  Big cinnamon and brown sugar aroma  Some notes of pumpkin/squash.

93,"2010-01-10",3.9,"Tap at BT VSK night.  Pours a nice hazy deep orange with a thin head. Aroma is sweet brown sugar, lots of pumpkin spices with ginger in there as well- big toasted doughy pumpkin and squash.  Flavor of pumpkin pie spices, molasses, sweet brown sugar, burnt toffee doughy yeasty- baked and toasted sugar pumpkins, ginger spices, gingersnap cookies, and good full body and sweet yet not cloying finish.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
93,"2009-12-21",4.0,"Tap at Blind Tiger: Deep orange/copper pour with a fading head. The aroma is a fantastic richness of pecan pie, cinnamon, ginger bread and apple crisp. Smells like the holidays! Velvety body with a rich yet dry flavor. Has qualities of canned pumpkin, pecan pie, ginger bread and lots of cinnamon. This was pretty awesome.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"
93,"2009-12-20",3.9,"Tap at Blind Tiger VSK.  Deep amber beer with a thin white head.  The nose is really lovely.  Loaded with rich sweet malt character and a bright spicy nose.  Toffee and lots of gingerbread character.  Ginger, allspice and a touch of clove.  Rich and sweet with a nice chewy gingerbread character.  There is a lot of similarity to Pumking, but this is a substantially different beast quite lovely.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
93,"2009-11-25",4.2,"Tap at the Blind Tiger for VSK. Wow, ok, this was just off the wall awesome. The aroma was completely out of control spice, just perfectly executed, with wintergreen, yams, mint gum, nutmeg. Jesus. Hardly even beer any more but Ill forgive them if they pull it off like this. The flavor has white sugar, fresh mint, light pumpkin spice and a definite squash. Easy drinking. As good as a spice-based pumpkin beer can get I wager.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
93,"2009-11-20",4.4,"Draft.  Pours an amber brune body with an off white head.  Aroma is phenomenal, pumpkin pie, cloves, spices, cinnamon notes, and big red cinnamon gum like.

93,"2009-11-20",4.0,"On tap at the Blind Tigers VSK3 event. Pours a clean orange with a thin white head. Amazing aromas, flat out the best smelling spiced beers I have come across.  Loads of gingerbread cookies, pumpkin pie and spices, pie crust, malt, caramel. Flavor follows the nose, but has trouble keeping up.  Light malty sweetness with some light caramel, finishing up with a great pumpkin pie flavor.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

93,"2004-10-29",3.2,"I had never tried a pumpkin ale but Ive been seeing them all over the place.  This one looks great, a nice orange/amber color w/ a bit of haze.  Smells good, too.  Nutmeg, cinnamon, etc. The taste...for me...waaayy to sweet.  I discovered that I dont like to drink pumpkin.  I dont fault the brewer on this one, but my expectations for what a pumpkin ale tastes like, I guess.","Michigan, USA","Dextolen"
93,"2004-10-23",4.1,"was lucky enough to be the 1st one to get the 1st pull off the tap waited for 30 min. while they cleaned the lines so they could start serving this tonight.was told that they cook pie pumpkins and clean and put the meat into the mashwith other spices. pour a golden orange with a white head. aroma the normal pumpkin pie spices in just the right amounts nothing over powering a nice blend. the flavor the same. had a nicce smooth mouth feel. this is the best pumpkin beer I have had so far.","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","walleye"
93,"2004-03-01",3.6,"Deep orange-brown, quite dark and moderately clouded.  Big beige, orange-tinged head.  Smells of enormous amounts of pumpkin pie spices, sweet brown sugar and cinnamon; overpoweringly sweet.  Flavor begins lightly spicey, but quickly develops a huge pumpkin meat flavor.  This tastes like eating pumpkin pie, very earthy pumpkin, lighter on the spices, though very sweet.  Light thinning occurs on the finish, which dosent go well with the overly sweet flavor, but other than that, no complaints.  The pumpkin meat flavor is so good and fresh, very good take on this style.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
