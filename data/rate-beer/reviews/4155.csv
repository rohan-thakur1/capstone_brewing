4155,"2016-03-22",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2016 March 2016 - Sampled from bottle at The Beer Boutique, Putney. As Mabinogion Mead - Transformation to Eagle, 15%. Pale yellow, still, clear, no head. Aroma is mostly clove sweets, woody with some light pot pourri. Body is a little light, smooth. Taste is sweet, as expected. A nice balance between the honey and apple, more clove, lightly woody finish. Quite well balanced. Strong medicinal clove and incense vibe. Interesting. Again, its a bit sweet and one-dimensional for my taste but I can see why people really like it. (3.5)

4155,"2016-01-27",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2016 Sample tried thanks to Ceara @ Mab Mead.
Delicate woodesque aroma with a light flower blossom character and restrained sweetness. Really beautiful. Clear vibrant but light yellow in colour with a slightly thicker viscosity than water.
Wow! The flavour begins with an aromatic peppery warmth and continues on to elicit wood like and finally cinnamon stick flavours. Absolutely astounding and by far the best mead I have ever tasted! In the interest of balance I must admit that there is one slight flavour lurking which I am not sure of, but it is a soft one and hardly detectable - very slightly chloric - or perhaps better described as medicinal. Possibly the interplay of the many flavours creating an illusion. This is very possible as the flavour is morphing, Im just blown away by all of these unbelievable flavours! The sweetness is a perfect level.","Bristol, Somerset, ENGLAND","leebotton"
4155,"2016-01-26",4.8,"While the scent is at first too sweet, the flavour is robust from sip to sip. Warming on the palate, the flavour lingers. Can truly taste the wildness of the apples in this cyser.","Herefordshire, ENGLAND","Tgn"
4155,"2016-01-11",4.8,"What a splendid example of a spiced cyser. Color is a bright rose crystal clear, aroma is warm cinnamon with well balanced floral honey. The drinkability is wonderful and cinnamon is calm and balanced with a semi sweet mouth feel and medium body that finishes dry but fruity. Very pleased with this mead looking foreword to what they will create next.","Arizona, USA","SKnox13"

4155,"2015-12-26",4.5,"Aroma is quite sweet, but lets you know what you are getting into.

Although the sweet and apple was a bitch much for me, the spicing rounded it out. Was happy with the initially light mouthfeel, though this gets stronger and lingers as you continue to sip the drink.

Very beautiful colour, pours softly, and fun design.

Just what I was expecting from my first mead, so very happy overall.","","DarkCap"
4155,"2015-12-26",4.6,"A truly beautiful golden colour, this absolutely looks like proper mead.

Not as sicky sweet as many meads can be, and far from a liqueur. Easy drinking and a good way to have my friends try a new drink.

A light taste made it easy to sip all night, but the strong scent wafted through the room whenever it was poured. 

Nice and appley, this went well with Christmas ham, but the cinnamon undertones made it appropriate for pudding as well. 

After three or four sips, the flavour really settled on the tongue. The profile is much deeper and rich than the initial taster makes it to be.

Will consider as a warm weather staple, as the fruity aspect kept it light.","Cardiff, WALES","Lovecrash42"
