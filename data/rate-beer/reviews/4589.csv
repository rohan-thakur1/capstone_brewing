Amazing over-the-top fruit coctail aroma, quite spicy. Smooth palate, a little slick. A touch dull in the palate, mashy light grains, a bit stodgy. Hops are a little acidic, very full hops. Not exciting me, does cover the alcohol well, possibly smothering it with stickiness? The previous brown ale pressed my buttons more. Not exactly messy, but not a particularly coherent beer.

Looks rather dark for a Witbier. Murky brown colour with a tiny off-white head. Absolutely delicious aroma full of fruity hoppiness, juicy sweetness, mild yeast and some smooth malty wheatiness. The flavour is quite strongly alcoholic. There's sweet fruity hops, mild bitterness, malt, wheat and some sugary sweetness. The flavour is too sweet to be enjoyable. Mild hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste.

Just before moving on I settled on this release. Not quite sure what to expect except a big body I was surprised to find a very drinkable wit. While it definitely does not fall into the ""sessionable"" category I could happily drink a pint or two and call it a night.

Aroma / Appearance - The carbonated wispy head protects a dense cloudy body. Like a glass full of orange pulp it is thick and creamy. Wheat, rye, sugar, and cotton candy are a mixture of festival and farm. The white pepper bite only adds another layer of complexity.

Flavor / Palate - White pepper, grapefruit, and chewy jam thicken like sap as they move from tongue to throat. The mouthfeel is a bit like drinking watered down marmalade. The tangerine finish brings in this great tropical aspect that almost had me going back to another. Im sure this will not be my last Magic Rock draft.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
