571,"2017-03-09",3.9,"After drowning in quads, trippels, and the indomitable Belgian Strong Ale, we finally found a genuine abbey dubbel to rate and its pretty good! New Belgium is a brewery I am usually kind of lukewarm on so I was pleased to find this pleasant and enjoyable. It has that distinctive beligan yeast taste but in a more robust malty body that is evidenced by the dark brown pour. It is like a belgian version of a brown ale. Good for nibblin on Popeyes while cuddling up your lover as a string laden Joe Walsh song plays.","New Haven, Connecticut, USA","meccahh69lol"

Looks: Clearamber rubyOne-quarter finger head with soapy white foam which fades in 20 seconds; Very good sticky lacing with very slight carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and sweet, very Bock-ish amber malt, with strong banana, strong caramel, strong toffee, dark fruits, light vanilla, phenolic, floral, sugar, alcohol, light cloves, light earth, Bel yeast and light grass. 

Taste: Mid sweet amber malt, with strong roastyness, strong nuts, strong Bock-ishness, strong red fruits, floral, fair molasses, phenolic, Bel yeast, dry biscuits, sharp lemon, close to strong bitter hops and grass.

Body: Medium body; Quite thick and slick palate.

Hoppiness: Floral, light earth and light grass in nose. Lemon, floral and grass in taste. Bitterness is fairly strong for a lasting, mid to high astringent neat bitter malty finish.

After Taste: Quite dry. Bock-ish and strong bitter to mouth.

Comments: This one has fragrant banana ester and caramel aroma, and a strong Bock-ish amber taste. Very hoppy bitter and well-rounded nutty maltyness. A Dubbel with many pluses. Recommended!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

571,"2016-11-13",3.5,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance was a ruddy semi-dark burnt red color with an ample amount of dark brown hues molding it slightly to a darker side. Good fingers worth of white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Messy foamy lace.
The aroma has sweet bready notes rolling over Belgian spices. Some sweet red delicious apple leans against some brown sugar, raisins and dates.
The flavor was basically the same with a quick Belgian sweet sort of malty aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it. ABV seems to hit fairly low allowing this beer to be pretty easy going.
Overall, pretty good Americanized Dubbel that I could have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

571,"2016-10-24",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 17, 2017 It has been rather awhile since I had had an Abbey. Wondering why I waited so long. I like the New Belgium roster generally but this is my favorite of theirs. Poured into a Belgian chalice and gave it a good inch of ivory colored foam. Great dark red body. Very nice aroma, earthy, musky, dark cherry. The taste is even better. I detect chocolate, raspberry, significant but pleasing sweetness, quite complex for an American brewed dubbel. So you can spend a serious amount for a bottle of Chimay Red or you can get a six pack of Abbey for around ten bucks. I do both but also will take the Abbey much more often.","Midland, Texas, USA","KevinReddirt"

571,"2015-01-06",4.0,"Poured from bottle into a chalice glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a deep mahogany color with some ruby highlights and a small off white head of fizzy foam. The head fades rather fast leaving a bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the beer is huge of a nice big fruity smell of a darker fruit nature, with plenty of raisin, plum, and some cherry. Along with these aromas are a nice blend of a yeasty smell as well as some aromas of a more roasted malt smell with some aromas of a coriander and clove mixed in along side. A little bit of a boozy smell is there as well, creating a nice fruity and warming dubbel aroma overall.
 Taste  The taste begins with a good dark fruit flavor of raisin and plum predominantly, with some lighter hints of cherry as well. Along with the fruit there is a little bit of a roasted taste as well as a very light boozy flavor. As the taste advances, the booziness increases all while fruitiness decays a little bit. At the same time, some yeast and spice of coriander and clove and a hint of banana and bubblegum come to the tongue. Some boozy tastes and a resurgence of the dark fruit occur at the end, leaving one with a fruity and warming dubbel flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is rather average as well. For the mix of fruity, yeasty, and boozy flavor of the brew, the feel is rather nice and does a good job of balancing the booze with the sweet fruit, making for a good moderate pace drinking dubbel.

571,"2014-07-24",3.9,"12 oz bottle best before April 2015. Ive pretty much sworn off this style, especially from Americans. Im glad I gave this one a shot because it has opened me up to dubbels again. The pour is a lovely shade of red with a tall white head. Its pretty clear for the style. The aroma is so tasteful, complex and not overdone. It irks me when Belgian style beers are sticky, overly clovey and lacking the defining nuances and delicacy. New Belgium has nailed it. Its estery, but not aggressive. Its floral, fruity with a tasteful level of spices. Malts are complex as well, bready, sweet and almost chocolatey. The palate is fairly full, yet soft on the tongue. Rich notes of cherry come out which fade to a perfect level of clove. This is a fairly sweet beer, but done so well. I normally want dry, but man this is good. It never seems sugary or candyish. Its teeming with natural flavors of dessert such as sweet bread, pie, fruits and floral tea. All this is sprinkled with a tasteful level of spice from the yeast. Really great beer. I probably wouldnt want more than one in a session, but I could enjoy the one any time, any day.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

571,"2014-06-25",3.7,"I normally think of dubbels as being at least a bit cloudy but this is a crystal clear copper color. Its got a big, rocky head of mixed-sized bubbles that clings to the glass in big chunks. The nose hits me at first w/ a bit of oranges--possibly from corriander--but over a banana note from the yeast comes more to the fore as well as some earthy cloves. This avoids the trap of being heavy that a lot of American Belgian styles fall in but does come off on the sweet side due to lack of bitterness. The nice thing about this is how well the slightly toasty malt character is expressed along the side the very prominent yeasty notes. This is medium bodied w/ pretty mild carbonation--especially for a Belgian--and finishes w/ quick medicinal cherry note which in not altogether unpleasant. This is really a good example of the style.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Aroma: Dark fruits and caramel with a moderately pronounced Belgian yeast flair.  Nice, but a little lacking for a dubbel.

Appearance: Brilliantly clear dark copper with a 1 finger off white head that doesnt stick around for more than 30 seconds or so.  Moderate lacing, but nowhere near most Belgian dubbels.

Taste: Caramel maltiness with dark stone fruits (plum/prune, cherry), raisin, and fig, and a faint hop character in the background.  Good Belgian yeast character, but not as pronounced as it could be.  A small bit of peppery spice from the yeast.  Slight roast on the finish.  Character lacks some depth.

Palate: Medium-light body and moderate carbonation.  Easy drinking, a good sessionable dubbel.  Finish is just a hair on the bitter side.

Overall: Very good beer - wont compete with an authentic Belgian dubbel, but worth going after since American dubbels are hard to find and are significantly cheaper than authentic Belgians.

571,"2013-03-03",4.3,"Love it. Pours a dark amber with a reddish hue. The head is off white. The banana and yeast aromas hit you right away. The aromas mature a bit after one gets over the yeast and banana notes, then a malty sweetness becomes noticeable. Taste has strong yeast characteristics and also matures into the caramel malt notes mentioned in the aroma. The carbonation adds some slight bitterness and breaks up the sweetness. Finishes smooth. Overall it's really great!

En cuanto a su apariencia, color café claro, algo turbia, con notas rojas muy intensas a la luz. Corona de espuma ligera y de poca retención. Carbonatación media.

En boca, notas intensas y complejas, principalmente una intensa sequedad y una amargura elegante al final.

En general es una cerveza agradable, diferente a la gran mayoria de cervezas elaboradas en el continente americano. Buenos aromas y cierta complejidad en el sabor, sin embargo aun está lejos de igualar las grandes cervezas de este estilo que por lo general y tal como lo señala el nombre de esta cerveza, son de Belgica.

571,"2012-08-25",3.5,"Poured into a beer mug.

A: Pours a deep chestnut-copper color with excellent clarity only broken up by the slightest of yeast haze. The carbonation is vigorous, almost intense, as it rises upward to its frothy two finger light mocha color head leaving thick clumps of lacing on the glass as it slowly recedes. Little bits of yeast settle at the bottom of the mug. Generally beautiful.

S: Quite fruity, as expected - raisins, figs, dried pear, banana, and apples all come together in the aroma. Buried beneath is a subtle scent of chocolate. 

T: Not bad, but a downgrade from the scent. The first sip is loaded with chocolate, which smooths out into a slightly tart bouquet of fruit. Lighter fruits near the initial swig turn into darker fruits at the finish. A layer of caramel is interspersed evenly throughout the flavor progression. Make no mistake - this doesnt challenge the taste buds like some of the Belgian dubbels do, rather it chooses to be mellow and easy to drink with only a modicum of complexity. As such, its not as interesting.

M: A little on the heavy side in terms of body, with the yeast providing prickly astringency and a coarser tone. Well carbonated, but not overly so.

O: Whereas something like Rochefort 8 invites sips purely so one can pick out its subtleties and story-like progression of flavors, this invites sips simply because its likable and easy to drink. Not incredible, but a decent no-frills dubbel.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Pours a brilliant copper with creamy off-white head. Flawless. Belgian yeast aroma is a bit overpowering at first, but after the beer had a chance to settle, the aroma has become fairly pleasant. Aroma is mostly of apples and pears. Some phenolics. The Belgian flavor is not too pronounced. A big, malty backbone helps keep the yeast flavors in line. Some butterscotch flavors, too.

The aroma was of a mild caramel malt, a light resin hop and a sweet yeast with notes of banana, maple syrup and some dark fruit with a mild alcohol tinge.

It tasted malty sweet with a hint of caramel and a touch of syrup in the beginning and finished about the same but with notes of banana, some fruitiness and a mild alcohol warming at the end.

Aroma: The nose is has sweet and malty, with some fruit, caramel, spice, and yeast

Appearance: It pours a fairly dark brownish-orange with a creamy beige head and lots of lace

Flavor: It tastes mid sweet with similar components to the nose, minimal bitterness

Palate: The body is rather creamy with fairly soft carbonation, and with a medium-full mouthfeel

Overall Impression: 
Overall, this is a pretty good offering.  It has a good amount of sweetness to it and a lot of flavor, but it isnt overly sweet.  The sweetness works well for me in this one, Id drink it again, it is a nice example of the style.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

571,"2011-05-21",4.0,"12 ounce bottle - I lost my receipt! from Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia. Well, actually, I sent it through the shredder.

Appearance: Pours out a clear, darkened amber-hued body with a largely-sized, off-white head.

Smell: Fruity, spicy, smelling of mashed bananas, golden raisins, and ground cloves coated in a variety of sugars. Teensy hint of chewing gum.

Taste: Modest tastes of caramel, brown sugar, and one lone, lost chocolate sprinkle with a background bread crust element. Tangy, ever so slightly sourish fruity, spice mix. Again, the cloves and light pepper are arm in arm with the fruitiness tasting of raisins, dates, and ripe bananas. Very faint herbal tone. As with the nose, theres a small hint of gum wandering about. The hops are incidental, at best. A little candyish sweetness, some drying action taking place, some spice and fruit on the smooth finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Just a hair above medium carbonation.

Overall: Dubbel perfection? No, but its certainly one of the better American-born dubbels available and has been for quite some time.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

571,"2011-05-06",3.5,"12oz bottle served at cellar temperature.
Pours hazy brown with a two finger beige head that leaves some foamy lacing and holds a nice cap down the glass.
Aroma is yeast, bread, banana, apple, pear, pink bubblegum, a hint of raisins, dark fruit and spice.  Very good strength.
Flavor is strongest in the bubblegum, banana, yeast and bread categories, underlying dark fruits, some caramel, minimal alcohol, fair sweetness, low bitterness.  A tad weak compared to other Dubbels.  As it warms the bubblegum pretty much completely takes over.
Mouthfeel is on the light end of medium, somewhat soft but with some carbonation bite at times.
A good American-brewed Abbey Dubbel, particularly for the price and the fact that it comes in a 6-pack.  Not the biggest fan of bubblegum-forward beers so Ill probably be skipping past this for Ommegangs Abbey Ale in the future.","Ringgold/Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA","elgiacomo"

571,"2011-04-23",3.4,"I poured a 12 oz bottle into two snifters and was greeted with a tan colored two finger head that faded fast to a light lace. The body of the brew was a dark amber in color.
The aromas of dark fruit were first and foremost in this brew. Raisin and figs came to mind as I inhaled. The flavor was more of the same towards the sweet side I expect the few years of age might have something to do with that. It had a medium feel in the mouth with good carbonation. All around this was a nice example of a Belgian Dubbel brewed in the states the yeast strain was spot on for me and it was well worth the try.

Dark fruit, raisins, slightly sour malt. Not much spiciness, and not as complex as hoped for. Why didnt that great smell come across on my taste buds better?

Low carbonation, chewy but seems watery and thin. Every single New Belgium beer I have had seems thin, but I had hoped a Dubbel would be the exception - apparently not.

More of an easy drinking Dubbel than others I have had, which are more sippers. On the other hand, the lack of complexity and the thin body are an impediment, and prevent me from wanting more.

Other than the 1554 (which is also somewhat thin) and maybe the Mothership Wit, I may be done with New Belgium. They are not bad beers by any means; I can just get much better in the same styles.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

Medium mouthfeel: cloves and sweet Belgian esters again serve as the central point here: crackers, brown sugar, and a permeating banana character; a really nicely balanced, solid dubbel, if a touch straightforward: theres nothing denser underneath (or maybe there is, with a bit of vanilla and maple syrup; quite soft), but I could drinks loads of this. Nicely drinkable rendition. Lasting finish of breadiness, clove, and lightly toasted malts; well-balanced end.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

Inch thick, dense and foamy, light tan head that dissipates slowly and remains pretty heavily laced. Aroma is sweet Belgian candies with a nice fruity Belgian yeast strain. Quite malty and fruity with lots of dark fruits, cherries, and bananas as well as a nice, subtle spicing. Good amount of chocolate and caramel in there too. Flavor is similar in complexity, but not as sweet. More towards the chocolate malts and drier spicing. The spicing stays subdued and soft, but is more noticeable along with a bit of roasted malts. Caramels and darker fruits as well before a dry, yeasty, spicy finish with a long chocolate spice aftertaste. Palate is medium bodied with a soft carbonation. Overall, a nice example of a dubbel. More chocolatey than most with a nice balance of spices that are lighter than most. Im a fan of this. Complex assortment of malts (which still has a bit of that biscuity NB taste, but not nearly as much as usual...which is nice...because I tend to like their biscuit malt taste, but not in excess), fruits, and yeast that give it a more dessert-like dubbel taste which puts it right up my alley.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

So the beer pours out really stunning nut-brown/cherrywood color with a 2"" thick beige, creamy head. Sticky lacing left behind is really nice. Aroma has a multi pronged attack. First its sweet roasted malts, then dried Christmas-type fruitcake fruits show up, then it switches gears to show off the nice yeast profile. Very perfumy. Mouthfeel is slightly hot with alcohol, medium bodied but solid. Flavors are just bounding my tastebuds every-which-way. A toffee wrapped banana, peppery and cloves, and the explosion of dark pitted fruits is quite enjoyable. Perhaps the residual sweetness plays on my sweet-tooth.

How: Bottle 12oz, from BeerAndBlues2, thanks a lot Brad!  Drank some 6 months after the trade so the bottle probably was about 1 year old.
The look: Clear ruby body with a medium beige of head
In long: A unusual mix of flavours for a so-called Abbey Dubbel.  Barley candies, bananas, cloves, dark grapes, cinnamon and some cherries.  Body is a bit slimy/sticky and with some kind of tar feeling (not a compliment).  Finish has some cherries sourness and barley candies sweetness.  Not a bad really but this is not Abbey Dubbel.

It is a transparent pecan brown color and has a generous level of carbonation and a foamy lasting head.  The sweet aroma contains caramelized malt with some tropical and dark fruits and a touch of alcohol.  Caramel malts, some banana and spice, a well-integrated fruitiness, and a hint of peat/smoke blend together to form the complex and satisfying aroma.  It has a roasty finish with a touch of hoppy bitterness that lingers.  Some alcohol peaks out here and there but adds some character.  The body is medium-full and is pretty smooth on the palate.  This beer is fairly complex overall and quite good.  It definitely exceeded expectations.  I havent had an Abbey Dubbel for awhile and this one hit the spot.

571,"2007-04-15",3.3,"Sampled on tap at the brewery tasting room.  Cloudy dark brown with scant tan head.  Aroma is a bunch of bannana and bubllegum.  Medium bodied with light carbonation.  Flavor is not near as sweet as the nose suggests, slightly earthy.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","chef201atc"
571,"2007-03-31",3.5,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2007 12 Oz Bottle. Warm and fuming aroma of grain esters, replete with candied orange peel, chocolate coating, faint pear and banana and an air of higher alcohols coaxing a toothy glow. Crystal clear florid ruby, with a fringe of fire and a microbubble, coarse silking head in ivory. Flavor is a full, somewhat ascerbic bite, dancing with grainy esters in peach skin, old lemon juice, banana skin and mango. The yeast carries some thin bitterness, a bit peculiar and disconcerting. The flavors are bold and straightfoward, however a little off and displeasing. Im surprised. Smack brings the familiar golding-leaf lemon herb bite, but the balance is almost unwarranted in the face of already herbal and slightly bitter main flavor components. Down the road, apple cider and pear brandy arrive with lots of money in their suitcases and it feels clean. Bubblegum comes to mind. I guess I expected somethin with less higher yeast products and more bready warmth and a nip of darker malt and caramel for depth. Palate is full, somewhat sweet and quite chewy. Foams and fills the mouth. The flavors are growing on me a good bit, but still edge a little soapy. Im not sure what to say about this beer. I can tell the ingredients are high quality and the brewing was exacting, but I wasnt expecting this result. Confusing.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Taste; just as the aroma implies, nice and malty. Theres some coffee, a light presence of anise, with a little chocolate with hints of caramel, and a just touch of some hop bitterness.

Some allspice and cloves, spiced and candied pears, and thick, doughy, yeasty bread are also all apparent in the aroma. The flavor is mild and sweet at first, on the tip of the tongue - hints of malts, wildflower honey, and cloves. Lots of fruit enter the picture on the middle of the tongue - banana, figs, and perhaps hints of dried cherries.  The finish is full-bodied with some malt flavor, some cloves, and hints of cough syrup. There is also a very slight hop bitterness on the back of the tongue, hiding in the after-taste.

Sharp up front, a little dry in the finish.  Overall - This is good and enjoyable, but not great.  Its a pretty authentic dubbel, but lacks some complexity.

Along with the aroma elements, the flavor was of light caramel malts mixed in with some spicing (cinnamon, something else), light bready notes, and a lightly hopped somewhat nutty finished. Only downfall from making this a primo dubbel was the underplayed dark fruit presence in the flavor, otherwise outstanding.

Its lacking in body compared to Belgian dubbels and has a slightly funky after-palate.  Still, it is a perfectly drinkable beer with pronounced banana and other fruity notes.  Yeasty with a great head, almost creamy.  I think its more complex than I give it credit for, although I cant tell what else is going on.  The Abbey Grand Cru that you could only get at the brewery was way more fulfilling, richer, and more complex.  I would still give it a try if you like dubbels, just to compare to the real deal.

Yeasty fore tastes slightly vegetal savory like baby corn. Not getting the malt or raisin notes others got. Bad bottle possibly.

The aroma was heavily malty with notes of roasted grain; Light hop notes of herbs and pine; trace yeast notes of earth; and trace miscellaneous notes of wood, aspen bark, honey and cornflakes. The flavor was moderately sweet and lightly bitter with a long, slightly unclean moderately bitter finish. The body was medium-to-full, the texture was watery-to-velvety, the carbonation was soft and there was a light alcoholic feeling at the end.

571,"2006-01-30",3.9,"Translucent, magnifying copper-brown in color with a separated, grey foamy moss shaped head.  Aroma is spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg, along with additional accents from ginger spread over chocolate grahams, shortbread, cinnamon sticks and chai tea.  Flavor profile is larger than the aroma would indicate.  Maple and cinnamon sticks help to bring this one down to an earthen level, where chestnut shells just so happened to have fallen onto as well.  Chai tea (spice and sweetness) is very prevalent, although theres something that seems artificial.  Cocoa dust and nutmeg cover a condescending impulse.  Golden raisins pulled out of sweet vermouth.  Nearly syrupy on the palate, yet slick and slippery at the same time.  Belgian yeast and chocolate and caramel malts tend to tip the scale, finishing with nutty cola and the form of spicing that sits on top of the froth of a holiday cafe mocha.

Head adds a creamy taste to the already rich, sweet flavor.  A hint of hops, but mostly malt and yeast, which makes the beer very easy to drink (and filling).

Absolutely beautiful, pour, head, activity, and lacing.  Medium body and nice balance; but once again, altogether to sweet for my admittedly relatively non-sophisticated taste.  This one should have a warning on it; the alcohol presence is quite unobtrusive and I could easily imagine where several of these might sneak up on you in a very bad way.  All in all, still the best New Belgium Ive tried, in spite of what Ive rated Fat Tire previously.  Nice Belgian Double, but drink responsibly or pay the consequences.","Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA","BetterRedFred"

571,"2005-10-02",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 1, 2007 Even the most chiseled erudite can sit down for an episode of the Simpsons.  Fine, Italian opera librettos are sophisticated, but Homers vernacular humor appeals to everybody, not just the upper crust of educated muckity-mucks.  My mother once told me that a truly admirable man of intellect can speak to anybody, whether it be Walter Russel Meade or the janitor.  New Belgiums Abbey is much the same way.  It may not be as advanced as some of its Strong Belgian Ale cousins found in the higher price refrigerator, but it has the same basic taste and it appeals to a broader audience.  
Its not quite a working mans beer, but the Abbey has a dusky, lowdown feel while keeping a high brow aura.  It pours a dark auburn, with a fantastic off-white head.  The foam is thick and looks welcoming to an eager lip.  The beer feels very muscular as well and full on the first sip before fully developing its flavor.  As per the tradition of Belgian ales there is a lot of fruit to be found, but mostly apple.  The Abbey also seemed sweeter than other Belgian ales Ive had.  Most importantly, the beer provides that fruits of the earth taste, and seems to be appropriate for drinking in a low lit room.  Not necessarily a tavern mind you, but a settled and cozy room.  I do like this beer.  It is, so far, my favorite from New Belgium.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Dark red/brown, mahogany color with a smallish head that gives way to just a persistent light lace. Nice appearance.
Smell is definitely fruity (raspberry and cherry?) with some chocolate and fig.
Taste is chocolatey, sweetly dark and rich like figs, with a depth of toasted malt in the aftertaste. Also picked up some pepper and grapefruit (!). Not overly toasty, just warm and rich. Im sure there are some hops in there somewhere, but their presence is delightfully subtle. The alcohol is there but masked by the spicey fruit and pepper.
Mouthfeel is where this beer delights! So smooth and round, you want to swirl it around in your mouth! Mmmm.
Perhaps a bit too rich for drinking many of these --- two or three is the limit. The alcohol limits consumption a bit as well.

It has the typical Belgian chalk-like, yeasty mouthfeel but then evolves into a complex flowery yet malty aftertaste with a bit of dryness. I would not serve it too cold as it releases much of its flavor when it warms up. The 7.0% alcohol content definitely kicks in, even after just one of these.

In the past I have definitely seen this brewery as pretty hit or miss...I still think that is true, this brew though is excellent. Poured into a crystal goblet. Lovely dark brown dubbel hue topped with a nice white foamy head that really lingered, was also quit rocky. The nose on this beast is excellently complex...much more complex than some real trappist dubbels ive tasted. PErhaps this is because they add more candy sugars to this beast than they might be obliged to in Flanders country but nose is of, rum, raiisins, pecan pie, candied yams, and perhaps a cabernet...I know pretentious but its in there. On the tongue this brew is equally masterful. The mouthfeel is superb. Whereas some Dubbels seem to simply be too watery or paper like on the palate this one was really round and wet. Very refreshing. The tongue caught notes of Brown Sugar...lots of sweet...soo sweet. Others have mentioned bubblegum and that is certainly in there as well.

571,"2004-03-17",3.6,"Very good take on the style. Perhaps the only think ""lacking"" would be a bit of conditioning yeast. The first Belgian abbey (Chimay) that I had years ago bowled me over by having a flavor I had never experienced. Now I believe I am almost at a temporary burn out. Sure hope that's not the case. I would probably RAVE about this were it not for that sensation of not being excited about all the flavors in here that are dead on target. A definite job well done.","austin, Tejas, Texas, USA","fly"

571,"2004-02-25",4.6,"This is a wonderful Belgium ale. It reminds me of an ever-so-slightly diluted Chimay Red. AND when you consider the price (which nearly all human beer drinkers do) is about 25% of the Chimay, it seems to be the overall winner when choosing a beer to have on stock. I especially liked the awareness of hops while not being blown away by them. Nice discovery for me.","Houston, Texas, USA","donyboy"

Hints of marmalade, christmas ham, lemon pie, plum and mince pie.  The spice is light and mild, but warmilngly present; the citrus and sour (like sourdough) yeast dominates making this pleasingly complex.

Ill take their word for it, but it was fairly clear.  Aroma has a slight hint of vinegar.  I liked that, light malt sweetness.  Flavor is pretty stereotypical (but good) for a abbey dubbel.  Medium body, earthiness and some light brown sugar.  Some slight brown bread and that New Belgium yeast flavor.  Touches of spice on the finish. This is a very delicate beer.  Elegant and well-made.

571,"2003-12-24",4.1,"Dammit, I'm finally impressed by a beer from this brewery. 

Pours a dark amber. From glancing at the other reviews, everyone else seemed to get a nice head, but there was none with mine, nor was there any lace. It *could* be that mine was too cold, but I don't think that was it.

Smells like a fruity malt, bananas are present.

Tastes...too good to be from this brewery. The sweetness abounds, but it's not really malty. There's bananas and cloves floating around there. It's very pleasant, dammit.

Mouthfeel is full and foamy, with a clean aftertaste.

Drinkability is quite good.

Okay, I still have the tripel to try. If it's as good as this one is, I may have to reconsider my hatred of this brewery. But you've got to admit, Fat Tire really lacks character. As popular as it is, if it had *half* the taste this has, the rest of the beer-drinking world would understand how good beer could be.","Port Orchard, Washington, USA","Gromit"

Overall, a nice beer-very good to try four months after getting back from the trip! A good beer to try in comparision to Chimay (Rouge)!

You wouldn't get away with this in in old Belgium!

(second tasting bottled) Reveals the same characteristics, only less outspoken. Apart from the bubblegum flavour, there's also a very outspoken earthy-mushroom taste.

(third test - presumably draught) Special version for competition purposes? The bubblegum/banana is still very much there, but has had to yield the field to other and more different fruity esters. Still very aromatic, benzene-like, but with a lot more depth to it. Better, but it will never be my favourite.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

Worthy of a poem, ""Ode to a Belgian Head"".  The flavors, too, are nice, once it is allowed to warm up.  The strength of the banana, with the charm of the dried fruit (raisins, I do agree that fig is there), some grape to me, and only the slightest undercurrent of spiciness--fleeting, and overwhelmed by sweetness.  At times the sweetness was a bit too much.  More important, there were moments when it was too mellow, even a hint of watery flatness.  A pretty nice combination of flavors, but a bit disappointing overall.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.

Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

The aroma is almost headache inducing due to the strong sugary banana-gum smell...this smells more like bad soda pop than bad beer. Caramel/sugar and banana/gum and thats pretty much it.

Cloudy brown color with medium carbonation and head.  Crisp, slightly acidic hints give it a slightly sharp mouthfeel.  Slight rummy alcohol warmth in the finish.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
571,"2001-08-10",4.6,"This stands among the best Dubbels on from this contenent. Complex with abalanced fruity plum flavor, head for the mountains ...and turn right  for this beer.","Mt.Prospect, Illinois, USA","Drew Blood"
571,"2001-04-24",3.0,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2008 Is it just me, or did New Belgium start off with great beers and then abruptly slash the quality of their beers once they got their desired market share?

I originally had this beer rated as a 4.3 overall: either Ive matured (doubtful) or the quality has tanked. This beer lacks all complexity and has just the barest hint Belgium flavor and texture. 

Still better than your average swill, but its nothing special by any means.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
571,"2001-04-16",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2003 Nice dubbel style interpretation.  Malty sweetness and yeast are quite evident, as is some spiciness.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
571,"2000-12-07",4.5,"A classic interpretationof an Abbey Dubbel, rich and fruity especially in the nose. Nice warming alcohol in the finish. Just wish I could get more of it. Very fresh tase and smell.","hunt sta, New York, USA","chimay67"
571,"2000-06-07",4.3,"What a beautiful beer! Wonderful deep red amber. Smooth head contrasted with strong flavor. Spicy; complex aromas beg you to describe them, but you cant; too many to identify. Youll think this beer was brewed in Europe. It makes me want to become a monk.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
