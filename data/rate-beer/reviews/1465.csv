1465,"2017-05-01",3.9,"750 ml bottle shared by seeswo - thanks again, Chris! Pours an opaque brown, deep and dark, with a tan head that settles into a good-sized ring with a filmy inner ring. Loads of chocolate and dark fruits here. Cocoa, dark chocolate, fudge, raisins, dates, oak, vanilla, and residual sugars. Tannins, molasses, brown sugar. Medium-plus bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sweet, rich, coating, slightly warming mouthfeel. Decadent. Id have guessed the brewery blindfolded.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
1465,"2017-04-25",4.0,"Thanks to seeswo. Deep dark pour like syrup. Ring of brown bubbles. Loads of chocolate, light oxidation, raisins, a little soy. Alcohol is not hidden - viscous but not thick if that makes sense. As it warms there are hints of coconut and graham cracker. Exceptionally sweet, nice and warming. Slick oily texture. Long brown sugar and caramel in the finish. Nice beer!","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

1465,"2017-03-14",3.8,"Via Christmastime BIF. Pours like motor oil into kingly shifter. Its not drastically different from an imperial stout and my deserdeserved hatred along with it, but its close. Its just cloying an unfair amount. Harsh, thick, sweet, and huge. Anise, black licorice, molasses, chocolate malt, black bread, roasred apples, and smoked maple experienced throughout. Not bad.

1465,"2017-02-10",4.1,"On tap @ Copenhagen Beer Celebration 2016. This one has a deep darkish brown color, and on the top theres small islandy and softly lacing brown head. Wow! Lots of aroma. Its almost a little sharp boozy, a good amount of vanilla, lots of cocoa beans. Rich chocolate, cocoa, marzipan. Just a really intense and mighty aroma - and lots of it! And it tastes lovely as well. Superb salty licorice, muscovado and molasses combined with honey sweetness and a rich chocolaty base. Wow this was good all the way! Its thick and oily in the mouth and its soft prickling on the bubbles. A mighty one. 13.05.2016","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Tastes of sweet vanilla, chocolate syrup, toasted coconut, and bitter oak, bitter coffees, spicy cinnamon. Damn. Thick and chewy, syrupy, but surprisingly not too sweet. Or, rather, its sweetness isnt to be rejected. This is a tour de force of the usual stout suspects. Technically this is an imperial porter, but it could pass for the best of Bourbon County pours.

The pour is a dark black with a thin brown layer of head that recedes. This pours thick as hell, I love it. The aroma is awesome. There is a ton of roasted malts, chocolate, light vanilla, and a great bourbon addition. The oak adds a little of depth behind it and brings out a hint of dark fruits. This is complex and deep. The flavor is much of the same. The chocolate and roasted malt lead into the vanilla and light dark fruits with a great bourbon and oak tying it all together. The mouth feel is thick and viscous with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly chocolate bourbon for you to chew on as it lasts. This is spectacular.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
