3348,"2017-05-26",3.7,"Sample at MBCC 2017. Fruity and hoppy smell. Similar taste with citrus and grapefruit. Im surprised to see this was a session IPA as I wrote down boozy and strong bitterness on this beer.","Örebro, SWEDEN","olsvammel"

3348,"2016-09-19",4.2,"Draft at Ginger Man. Murky yellowish color with a thick, frothy foam of white head that sticks around for a while. Clean, fruity hop aroma. Lots of resin, pine, and cattiness. Dry, hoppy flavor, pithy and clean. Drinks great. Smooth, clean, dry. Not at all watery or thin. Really good.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
3348,"2016-09-17",3.7,"Draft at OH. Lots of grassy, green, pithy, dry hop taste. Lots of action on the palate. Very hopped up for a session IPA. Sweet, fairly complex aroma. Good.","USA","Slipstream"
3348,"2016-09-06",3.8,"Tap into a shot glass showing lightly filtered apricot yellow with a finger of clean white foam. 

The nose is subtle and barely any aroma upon pouring, needs time to warm up. Upon warming up light notes of grapefruit and cannabis begin to show. But my score stands due to the subtly. 

The palate is moderately carbonated and light bodied. Flavors of dry pineapple and cannabis with a light bitterness and a barely perceivable malt note on the linger.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"

3348,"2016-07-19",3.8,"rom notes. This one was enjoyed at Traviss house during a planned two-man IPA rampage on July 5. 16 oz can. The pour is a foggy golden yellow color with a large white head that falls down to a film, leaving a good bit of lace. The aroma is dank as fuck. There is a ton of citrus zest. Hoppy pine and zest. I love it. The flavor is just like it smells. This is incredible for a session. There is a lot more grain picked up in the taste, but its really well balanced. There is a nice juiciness that makes its way in and that decently large hop dankness. The mouth feel is light and crisp, with a softer carbonation and a lingeringly dank pine resin finish. This was surprisingly good.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3348,"2016-06-27",3.8,"Fresh can. Nice session IPA with a ton of hop aroma bursting out of the can. I was surprised, though, by how malty the actual beer tasted. Theres a nice grain taste, but I didnt get any overwhelming hop flavor like the nose promised.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

3348,"2014-07-21",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 12, 2016 Draft at the brewery with Brendan, Andrew, Ellen and streets. Fresh and dank. Sessionable and delicious. Pours a beautiful hazy murky orange body with thin white lacing. Aroma is floral and citrus hop, light bready character and a strange soapy flavor. The soapy character comes out much more on the palate and lingers a bit more than preferred but the other flavors of floral hop, pine and citrus fruits work nicely. Another really solid beer from Other Half. Cheers.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"

Nice big floral & tropical fruit hops up front, thick pine forest, fresh bread, and some super slinky skunky funky hop nonsense. Flavor is bready pale malt, bitter citrus peel & floral hop, fresh lemon zest. This thing is packed with hops but so fresh, clean and drinkable... Small green everything indeed. Crushed it. Top of the session ladder.  Batch 2 (2015) > Batch 1 (2014)... By a wide margin.","New York, USA","drsandman"
