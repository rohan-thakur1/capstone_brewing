For a non-alcoholic beer (and as such it should be judged) this is very good - be it from a glass or straight from the bottle. Its fruity, perfumey, citrusy, grapefruity, piney, grassy - aroma and taste are both quite strong and more sweet (maybe even overtly so) than bitter, its got a light body and medium carbonation, only slightly watery palate. It is admittedly better when cold.
