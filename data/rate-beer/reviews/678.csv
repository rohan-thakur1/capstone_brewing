678,"2016-09-04",4.2,"22oz bottle number 125. Pours out black topped with a small head. Nose is big roast malts bourbon barrel vanilla chocolate sweetness marshmallows coffee. Taste is more of the heavy barrel treatment marshmallow sweetness plenty of chocolate malts and roast.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"
678,"2016-01-04",4.0,"Pours a dark chocolate brown color thats nearly opaque with dark mocha/mahogany edges and a one finger beige head that quickly settles into a thin ring. Mediocre retention, disappearing mid way through the pour with minimal spotty lacing left behind. Carbonation looks low but this beer has nice color.

Sweet boozy aroma with a really nice barrel presence thats nicely integrated into the notes of the base. Slightly charred oak with sweet, boozy bourbon, toasted coconut and silky vanilla bean. Underneath, there is faint roast with coffee bean and burnt malt countered by luscious, dessert-like sweetness. Hints of bakers chocolate, fudge and licorice. Smells pretty nice with pleasant barrel notes but could use heavier roast.

Medium body, slightly viscous with soft carbonation and prominent barrel notes. Charred oak, spicy bourbon and vanilla stand out without obliterating the other flavors. Underneath, theres a nice balance of dark roast and lighter malt sweetness. Malt bill is more robust than nose hinted out but still less than expected. Charred toast, burnt sugar, coffee bean and bitter dark chocolate countered by caramel, toffee and dessert-like sweetness. Well balanced, complex and deceptively drinkable.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

678,"2015-07-16",2.9,"UPDATED: JUL 17, 2015 22oz bottle pours dark brown black with medium fizzy head. Nose is nice initially with some caramel, chocolate, and nutty sweetness. On the palate things fall apart, very thin watery body, some bitter nutty chocolate, light ashy chocolate, and cola, there is a bit of a tangy note creeping in that seems to be heading in a weird direction. Finishes thin, light roast, dark bitter chocolate, stale cola, a bit sticky. Past its prime and not very good anymore, unfortunately.","Hampton Roads, Virginia, USA","JBPortland"

678,"2015-04-09",4.0,"Bottle... This beer rocks! Pours about as dark as a stout. The aroma presents caramel, dark chocolate and a rumor of cinnamon. Ultra Full-bodied with a velvety mouthfeel and relaxed carbonation. The rich flavor is a malty and spicy swirl of sweet caramel, candied tree nuts and mocha with hints of cinnamon and maple preceding a warm bourbon component. Roasty-sweet, burnt marshmallow and bourbon finish. Kudos to landhoney for providing this world-class beer!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
678,"2015-02-16",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2015 Pours dark with a soft foam head that dissipates to hug my glass. The aroma is of inviting bourbon, oak, dark malt character, sweet burnt buttery caramel like syrup, and vanilla. Tasting I picked up on warming bourbon, a blending of malts and syrup sweetner. The balance between sweetness and bitterness was enjoyable with a pleasant dry boozy bite. I was surprised that this beverage did not affect my palate more. The finish was rather great. It was on the threshold of too much bourbon and too much booze but with the blending of ingredients it tamed those intensities. Overall a hell of a beverage. It is hard not to appreciate this.","Steubenville, Ohio, USA","Advocate_Ames"

678,"2014-08-22",3.5,"2014-08-16. Black body with a small tan head. 3++ Aroma of rich dark malt and bourbon. Flavour is similar with a sweet rich dark malt base and bourbon character throughout. Dryish roast and bourbon lingers. Smooth medium to full bodied palate, soft carbonation. Rich, but the base isnt sufficiently supportive of the bourbon at this point in the evening.

678,"2014-07-10",4.0,"Bottle. Pours a pure black color with a small beige head, almost no carb. The aroma is wonderful: huge barrel, oak, molasses, smoke. Sweet, woody, sugary, hot, boozy big sweet barrels, cherries, some smoke, vanilla, a bit of leather. Smoky and really it tastes oxidized in a way I like. A sort of unique take in total. Very good.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
678,"2014-06-21",4.1,"Woodshed 3.0! Big thanks to dak for saving this whole series and sharing with us. Awesome!! Bottle pours with a mahogany colored body that supports a tan head of foam. The aroma offers up sweet malts, chocolate, vanilla and then a mix of molasses and bourbon. The taste has malt and molasses smoothed over dark roasted malts and brown sugar dusted chocolate brownie. It then gets into a firm degree of bourbon and booze creating a nice balance to the sweetness. Tasty stuff as the roasted malts and barrel notes go together well here and surprising little sense of the big ole ABV.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

678,"2014-05-08",4.3,"Sampled on draft at Hou Thou this beer poured a black color with a small foamy beige head that faded quickly and left no lacing. The aroma was very strong bourbon, coconut, vanilla and almost hot peppers. The flavor was very strong bourbon, wood, coconut, chocolate, vanilla, port wine, sweet malts and a hint of anise. Astoundingly boozy but it worked for me. Just a incredible amount of depth to the flavor. Very long finish. Very thick and full body. Marvelous.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"

678,"2013-10-07",4.2,"Bottle, shared 5 ways about right, the pour is a dark black, maybe with a little purple. Light head, aroma was bourbon and heavy sweet malts. The taste was not as much bourbon as I would expected. Quite a heavy beer with heavy mouth feel. There was some licorice in there, some barley, and it finishes with bourbon. A lot like a barley wine. This is drinking well now but I can see this improving well with age","Ontario, CANADA","Ontbeertaster"
