1372,"2016-10-31",3.7,"Solid dunkel, especially since Im not a lager guy. Roasted, deep malt front fades into hints of caramel and cookie, yet a modest herbal hopping keeps the sweetness at bay. Not too carbonated, thick and smooth, yet refrains from growing cloy as it warms.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

Small, tan, foam eventually dissipates. 2/3FLAVOR: Surprisingly sweet for the style; dark, toasted malt (not burnt or deeply roasted). Slight nut character in the background. Finish with strong toffee/chocolate flavors. Mild spicy hop bitterness for balance. Delicious. 18/20MOUTHFEEL: Medium body, but still quite crisp. Sweet but not cloying. Smooth and highly quaffable. 5/5OVERALL IMPRESSION: Almost a perfect beer. Impressive considering so few American breweries make this style.

1372,"2016-07-09",3.5,"12oz bottle nose is toasty and roasty. Sip adds herbal and grassy bitterness. Goes down very easily almost like flat cola. Reminds me more of a schwartz bier. More than decent balance.","Taylor Mill, Kentucky, USA","Chudwick"

1372,"2015-08-27",3.4,"On tap at Alliance Brewing. Black, creamy beige head. Smells fruity and some roasted notes. Not as sweet as some dunkels, more roasted tasting. Some woody flavored, too. Pretty good...","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
1372,"2015-08-16",4.0,"Pint on tap. Near ebony body has some ruby tints. A lasting ring and small islands of cream on top. Nose is dark bread, espresso with touches of caramel and tart berry. Tastes of mocha, graham cracker and dark toast. Theres some berry, ash and marshmallow on the finish. Medium bodied with a medium-low carbonation and an excellent balance. Seems more of a Schwarzbier, but tasty no matter how you categorize it.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
