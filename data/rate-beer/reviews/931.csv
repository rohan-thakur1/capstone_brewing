931,"2011-06-18",4.0,"taken from notes: I enjoyed this on tap at the brewpub in New Albany, IN. Served cold in a tulip pint.

A - A deep copper burnished caramal w/ an inch of light cream that drops quickly. Has a fine bead. There is moderate stickage. The contrast between the red/amber and light tan head is striking as the rings of lace cling tenaciously.

S - Nice mellow simcoe and cascade citrus w/ subtle floral notes and tangerine/clementine-like juicy sweet aromas.

M - Very mild bitterness seamless malt and hop unity, the sweetness seems to be submerged at first but actually works in tandem w/ the slightly bitter and tart notes of the fresh hop notes riding the fruity and effervescent feel.

T - Very much like a pale ale w/ the accent ofn the flavor of the simcoe and the cascade along for the ride. I am very impressed w/ the 1st beer I have had at a brewpub in Indiana. Nice malt anchoring(no pun intended) the sweetness is restrained, but has a nice dry and lightly grainy mild roasteed flavor w/ subtle rye notes -kind of bready as it warms w/ a subtle astringency and the hop flavors remain all the way true to the end.

D - Described as a ""session beer"" on the menu, I cant exactly agree, but 5.6% is close enough. Very Drinkable, I could return to this without hesitation. For me this has a swiss army type of universal flavor. The malt smoothness and plenty of hop sweetness and citrus flavor. This ale is well crafted and hard to find fault with the quality.","York, Pennsylvania, USA","Slatetank"
931,"2010-09-05",3.2,"Served on tap at the brewpub. The appearance is a lighter amber with a white head. The nose is light caramel, and kisses of hops. The flavors are similar with the hops underwhelming a bit.. The mouth is medium carbed and bodied. Would like a touch more hops but a nice session-able beer.","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"
931,"2010-08-04",3.0,"On tap at the brepub.  Meh, this one was a bit off balance.  I am not too familiar with this style, but I would choose plenty of other offered beers over this one, as this NABC location has one of the best bottle lists in the world!","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"
931,"2010-06-19",3.2,"Draft. Hazy amber body. Off-white, frothy head, diminishing. Aroma of grain, pine, biscuit, citrus. The flavor is lightly to moderately bitter and lightly sweet. It finishes lightly sweet and moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Very much hop forward with bitterness throughout the sip. Earthy, yeasty notes in the finish.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"
931,"2010-05-13",3.1,"On tap. Pours a cloudy orange with an off-white head that laces nicely. Aroma has a strong pine hop profile with a slight undertone of biscuits. Flavor begins with a strong hop presence, but the biscuit note grows to a well balanced finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
931,"2010-02-24",3.8,"Draft at the New Albanian Public House.  Pours a slightly cloudy amber.  The nose is a nice blend of mild, though aromatic piny hops and bread like malts.  The flavor is likewise very well balanced.  A good solid hoppy bitterness dominates.  Not incredibly complex but an excellent session beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Teege"
931,"2010-02-14",3.1,"On tap at Steves Birthday bash at the Livery: Medium amber hued with a solid but small head. The aroma has notes of pale grains and some crystal malts, herbal and minty hops, a bit of pine, some buttery notes as well. The taste is pretty balanced between the common malts and moderate to light hop bitterness, fruity and a touch minty. The mouth feel is smooth and refreshing, a bit short upon the finish. A good brew but hardly what I think of when it comes to this style.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

This was my final pint of the day before moving onto the Bluegrass Brewing Company.  A decent enough way to wrap up the afternoon it was not quite what I was expecting.  Pretty average overall I don’t think I would choose this over the mild or Old 15 if either was available.  California Commons might be hard to find for a reason.

Aroma / Appearance - A half finger dense white head sat above the lively golden body.  Very transparent it smelled of lemon zest, pepper and apples.  A wheaty bse held everything together along with a crisp hoppiness.  It definitely gets better as it warms; let it get to room temperature for maximum enjoyment.

Flavor / Palate - Strongly bitter it is more aggressive than I anticipated.  Sticking to the back of tongue it gives more of an impression at warmer temperatures.  Too harsh for my tastes (at least for a non IPA) this is an interesting experiment.  If hoppy low alcohol beers are your thing order a pint.  If not check out the other offerings instead.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Pours fairly clear gold with a persistent off-white head.
The aroma has plenty of malt and citrus hops.
A dry bittereness leads off for the flavor profile and is quickly followed by some maltiness.
Well balanced and not too over the top. A good easy-drinking beer, especially for someone just becoming initiated into the realm of craft beer.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"
