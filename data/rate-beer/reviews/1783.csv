1783,"2015-04-22",2.5,"Pour on tap at the brewery, clear dark orange-red pour with white head, aroma brought notes of bread, dough, toast, some caramel, toffee into a bit of grass, slight herbal notes. Taste was a mix of caramel, toffee, bread, toast into a bit of grass, herbal notes, husky notes, with a slight yeast note, finishing fairly dry, slightly sweet.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
1783,"2012-06-21",3.7,"On tap. Pours with a crystal clear wooden-copper hued body with a large bone hued head that lasts and leaves good lace. Aromas are malty, bready, toasty, biscuity. Very clean. Light soap. No esters. Flavors are malty, bready, biscuity and clean. Lots of toasted malt character. Very nice. Medium to medium strong carbonation. Medium bodied. Crisp and clean.

Another excellent lager from Taps.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1783,"2012-06-18",3.5,"Pours a caramel orange color. Nice malty aroma. Taste is very toasty. Very pleasant. Good grain taste. A light base makes this very drinkable. Well balanced.","Glendale, California, USA","beersearcher"
1783,"2012-06-10",3.4,"On tap.  Reddish amber pour, with a light tannish head.  Toffee, toasted bread, some sweetness, and lightly dusty.  Pretty good for the style, but not something that interests me to much.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
1783,"2011-10-09",3.3,"dark copper. light scent flavor of malt and chocolate toffee. Not strong but tasty  sweeter than Mexican varieties","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
1783,"2011-04-29",3.8,"A: The pour is a dark amber color with a couple fingers of creamy, khaki colored head.

S: Nice aroma of toasted bread, toffee, and light caramel.  There is definitely some lager yeast in there and a touch of earthiness I would assume comes from the hops.  Perhaps a light floral note as well.

T: More of the same as I take a drink.  Nice toasted malt flavor with a really substantial breadiness.  Moderately sweet with some toffee.  There is a subtle earthiness to the beer and some yeastiness.  A very mild bitterness.

M: Medium in body with a nice crisp carbonation.

O: Quite refreshing and rather pleasant to drink.  One of the better Taps beers I can recall having.  Solid stuff.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

1783,"2009-04-23",3.5,"Tap at the Corona location. Dark brown pour.Roasted malt aroma, but on the light side of the roast scale. Flavor was light roast as well, like putting ice cubes in coffee. Very drinkable and pretty damn good too.","Redlands, by way of Wisconsin,, California, USA","Hophead22"
1783,"2005-06-10",3.4,"Chestnut brown brew with little head. Malty, caramel nose. Medium/light body with a burnt toast aspect to it. Very little in the way of hop bitterness. A decent brew to session with.","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"
1783,"2004-05-03",3.0,"I dont remember this beer too well, but I do remember a very carbonated mouthfeel which was slightly thin.  Was crisp with the finish but left a bad sweet aftertaste.","fremont, California, USA","y0cola"
