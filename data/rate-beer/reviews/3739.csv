Flavour of graininess, harsh bitterness, grass and some berries. Light bodied and harsh mouthfeel. A bit harsh carbonation too. Not my kind of a beer.","Tampere, FINLAND","lusikka"

3739,"2015-07-29",3.4,"On tap @ Half Door. Dark amber colored beer with white foam. Irish Red Ale with Citra hops? Okay, guy. Good malty aromas and flavors. Plenty of toasty bread and malts. Slight floral note along with some grapefruit and orange. Mild pine bitterness, too. A little bit of a fruity, estery character that I donÂ’t necessarily care for.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3739,"2015-07-06",3.5,"Draft. Pours amber gold with a white head. Rich bready malts, toast, faint earthy hoppiness, and a nice clean and toasted malty finish that dries out with little residual sweetness. Solid.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
