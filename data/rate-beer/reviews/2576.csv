2576,"2017-06-16",4.1,"500 ml. no bottling date apparent, but indicates it¬ís 8% abv and good for 969 years, the same as the biblical Methusalem. Pours a deep mahogany with a purple tint and sports a lasting topping of a creamy mauve film. Interesting aroma with rotating elements of earthy bread, coffee, smoked meat, blackberry and grape. Flavors of earthy smoke, blackberry, cocoa, fig, grape and prickly green herb. Medium-plus body has a fine, smooth medium carbonation and a very drinkable balance.
