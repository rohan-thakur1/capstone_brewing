Plenty of caramel dipped raisin. Lightly toasty. Subtle, earthy hop character. rich finish. Full body, smooth.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
3697,"2017-03-26",3.7,"Served from bottle into glass at home. Pours amber brown in color, ruby tinted, low clarity, with small tan colored head. Deep fruity aroma, like dried cherries, with caramel malt character. No hop aroma detected. Flavor is primarily clean caramel maltiness with some light fruitiness. Low bitterness and mild sweetness. No alcohol flavor detected. Medium full body with medium low carbonation. Overall this beer is interesting. The lack of hops in both aroma and flavor is surprising and results in a sweet malty beer. Intensity of flavor is also lacking for an imperial and the alcohol strength is not apparent. Even with the deviations from style expectations, this beer is enjoyable and easily drinkable.","Wisconsin, USA","handmuffin"
3697,"2017-02-11",4.0,"As delicious a red ale as Ive come across owing largely to the generous malt bill to give it a smooth, sweet character without coming across as heavy. Theres even the hops squinting through at the end with mild bitterness to further balance the effort. Ive not had many from Karben4 and this one makes me want to seek out more.",".08 Junction, Wisconsin, USA","mrjaxson"
3697,"2017-01-05",4.0,"Aroma is a mix of English malts and complex toffee, caramel and nutty. The flavor is nutty malts, toffee/caramel, fruit/dark fruit and a mix of tart and slight earthiness in the finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"

3697,"2016-07-14",2.6,"12 oz bottle, sampled in a rounded whisky glass, from 6 pack purchased at Willy St Co-Op (West), Middlteon WI. I guess I just have to face the fact that, after 37 tries and more than a decade, I just dont much like Irish Ales. Theres something sticky and disgusting and cloying about them, often; that or the opposite, a thin astringency; for whatever reason, I rarely find the sweet-dry balance in this style to work for me. This one alas is no exception. The color is nice enough, a deep red-burgundy, with just a bit of head which dissipates rapidly. Aroma of caramel, grape and vanilla is quite sweet and dessert-like, also lightly smoky, pleasing on its own but presaging problems to come...sipping it we get a mouthfeel that is simultaneously thick, cloying and syrupy - but grows rapidly watery towards the end. Very sweet, almost Port-like flavor, with some raisin and maple hints, and an unfortunate funky herbal/manure character that appears in the middle that is not in keeping with this style or the thickness of the front-palate experience. Its very hard to describe, to me this seems like a mixture between a Scotch ale and an unblended Lambic - and these are two great tastes that DO NOT taste great together. Hopefully the last Irish I try for a while. Well, beer anyway.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
3697,"2016-06-04",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2016 Pours dark mahogany, brief head. Light, malty aroma. Flavor, pleasantly smokey and lightly sweet, malty, faint hop finish.

3697,"2016-02-03",4.1,"Yup. Sexy as hell indeed. I didn't rate it at the time, but have had it at the brewery as well. Just as good in the bottle. Toffee and raisin, just got some bitter chocolate. Enough hop to balance it, but it almost gets too sweet. Almost. A very solid beer. Everything seems to get put into barrels these days, I'd be interested what this would do.

3697,"2015-05-04",3.6,"On tap at The Majestic Theatre bar for Derby viewing and the second day of Madisons Craft Beer Week. Dispensed to plastic, showing a deep, ruby highlighted, brown tone, with some quickly diminishing, tan head froth, but a persistent ring & film, and spots & streaks of lacing. The nose was toasted, with a touch of roastiness, light grain, subtle spice, and toffee. Medium bodied, with decent carbonation, the taste continued the pleasant malt, and dark caramel/toffee sweetness, and included a moderate, roasted & earthy hop bitterness. The plastic might not have done it full justice presentation-wise, but quite tasty, nonetheless.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

3697,"2014-04-19",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 2, 2014 On tap at brewery and later from growler. Yeah I had to buy a growler, so good sign there. This is a dark reddish beer with an off white head. The aroma can be of caramel, earthy hops, and sweetness. Taste is great, this is a very malty flavorful brew, much more dynamic malt flavor than I was expecting for a red ale. Caramel, hints of earth, raisin, faint probably Old world hops. Finish is a lingering malty sweetness, yet quite drinkable. I have noticed slight variations after having been exposed to this brew a few different times over the past year, but still always enjoyable. 6-2-2014 had in tap at Brews Brothers, this is becoming one of my favorite malty beers. Strong dynamic malt flavor and aroma. So good! ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone","Wisconsin, USA","akoeninger"
