Once we finally get the damn cork out of the bottle, we get a slight puff and a hazy straw-colored pour, decent head. Amazing, amazing aroma.

4088,"2016-09-27",3.1,"375mL bottled in 2015, drunk 9/16/16.Bright, golden-bronze body is topped by a medium-sized, white head showing moderate retention for the style. Good clarity, sediment left behind.The primary notes I get from De Troch are cork, leather, strong mineral, very light must/wool blanket and a hint of cheese. Theres some fruitiness there, as well, though its not intensely full of green apple, like Boon. So it smells ok to me, but its just such a far cry from the bright, fruity, band-aid-laden brett of 3F and controlled, yet intricate funky brightness of Cantillon, to name the best. I suppose it has its merits, but its not my cup of tea. There is some light malt/wheat character in there, as well, adding light honey/caramel. A touch of powdered sugar/vegetal character but not too heavy/problematic. No alcohol noted.I find it fares worse in the mouth, with more sweetness (not artificial, though there is some very light saccharine) than Id care for. Rather simplistic, with cork and mustiness not matching up to the great lambic houses very well, in my opinion. Kind of vegetal/sugary on the finish, with very light oak suggestions and lots of fruitiness. Carbonation is fairly engaging, natural, at least.

look: 3.75 smell: 4.25 taste: 4.5 feel: 4 overall: 4.25

First pour is a clear light gold colour with a small head of foam. No sound was made after I popped the cap and removed the cork. 

Big sourness grips my nose buds with every whiff. No fruit sourness that I can detect. Its all a wine like vinegar like sour. 

The taste is big sour. Again, theres a lot of winey vinegary tartness that explodes on my palate along with the woody notes from the French oak. And of course, the finish is ever so dry. 

More carbonation than I thought it would have after hearing zilch when I removed the cork. Not in excess by any means. 

I have 1 other beer from this brewery so when I saw this, I had to give it a go. I am glad I did.

Quite flat, the cork makes no pop, and the beer pours quite still with a few large bubbles. The beer is a clear, light amber color that shows some gold tinges when held up to the light. The aroma smells tart, earthy, and funky up front, and finishes with an interesting character that I cant quite place my finger on. The aroma has a soft, woody, slightly spicy, oak character to it, a lemony, sort of grapefruit, most definitely lactic tartness to it. Musty, damp, sunless earth and mushroom leaning notes anchors the nose here. Sun dried hay / straw, some wholesome pale grain notes.

The beer has just a hint of carbonation to it, though this is really just a hint, the body has a soft texture to it that is not watery, despite the lack of effervescence; it has a lactic slickness to it, and a touch of oaken structure. Tart, but not overly sour, woody oak flavors, soft grain notes reminiscent of sunbaked hay, and washed out wheat crackers, a hint of ""cat-pee"" like character, a fair amount of funky, earthy mushroom notes, and just a touch of stale sweat and barnyard character to round things out.

I certainly would have preferred this with some carbonation, a lively effervescence would have even been better; the extra zip would have made the aroma and flavor much more expressive than it is. Having said that, this is still quite tasty, and certain helps me with my Lambic fix / cravings.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

4088,"2015-03-24",3.7,"750 ml bottle acquired from Binnys South Loop (Chicago, Ill). Finally completing this series. Pours a glowing darker golden amber hue, a gentle haze with subtle darkness and dulled glow through the body. Frothy brighter white head was a good firmer layer and slow grower, firmer ringer with decent lacing. Aromas are quickly rubber and lactic, decent funk and sour fruit meet distinct yogurty sourness, citric lemony and acidic jabs meet straw, barnyard and funk. Some earth, vanilla, kiwi and sour fruit melange growing quickly. A bit rubbery, funky with jabs of oak, earth and popping sour life on the nose. Initial is a bit different, a touch flabby and still with just a kiss of dulled carbonation. Some sharper metallic and lactic notes grow slowly. Gentle bread, stale earth and grainy malts meet oak, creamy and tart yogurt. Citrus rind and juice jabs are lemony, a bit of grapefruit with gentle crab apple, funk and cobwebs compliment a bit more on the backend with slowly crawling oak, dry straw and decent funk. A bit slick and tart into the backend, some grainy malts, straw poke through a bit more as that initial sour front end tapers out a bit. Dry, some yogurt and firmer funk meet decent oak, wet wood and gentle vanilla soften this up. Tangy tartness lingers on the palate with stale bread, gentle sweet and sour apple elements, faint pear and frsh bread with just a kiss of spicy like Belgian yeast poking through at times. I really liked the assertive nose on this one while the palate flab on this one and a tapering profile as we get past the front makes it a bit more average overall. A touch of saltiness and mineral quality up front tapers off but overall this one is solid if lacking any sort of flash. Id like a bit more pop and spritz for my personal tastes (and I think the Lambickx Kriek is still the winner in this series and by default the Zenne series it is made with), this Gueuze is no slouch.

4088,"2014-03-02",3.6,"750 ml bottle shared by DrSilverworm - thanks again, Chris! Brew year 2008, bottle year 2011. Pours a clear gold color with no head. Notes of lemon, cheesecloth, dry grains, earth, oak, and plenty of funk. Light-bodied, with low carbonation and a flat, tart, acidic mouthfeel. The aroma really worked for me but the mouthfeel was just a little too flat overall for me. There was some debate about how the flatness was intentional, which I understand, but this was flatter and thinner than others in the style.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

4088,"2012-12-25",3.9,"750ml into a champagne flute.  Basically still, slightly hazy golden color pour.  Nose of tartness, funk, barnyard, earth, oak, although I did note it to be a bit muted.  Upon my first sip, I was extremely disappointed - it tasted watered down and very subtle to my overly spoiled lambic-craving palate. I let it sit and wandered off to do something else.  Please take my advice and let this decant or ""open up"" for several minutes before trying it - it will make a world of difference.  After a second sip several minutes later, much more sourness/tartness was apparent along with much more depth and complexity. All of the character slightly evident from the first nosing and tasting came out in fuller force - funkier and tarter with a long-lasting finish.  This is a much more delicate lambic than many - but still one worth seeking out.  Unfortunately, it also commands a fairly high price tag - $24 - but be aware there are only 2000 bottles.  There is another version with a nearly identical label with a 5000 bottle release, this is the better of the two - especially considering they are the same price.

Pours a rather hazy amber gold with a thin white head, sort of scummy looking bubbles that fall off quickly.  Big cheesy funk right away, lots of barnyard, funky old cheese, a touch of sweet old malt.  Not entirely still, but theres not much in the way of carbonation going on.  Cheesy, more funk, and a bit of a plastic pool toy aftertaste. My wife claims it tastes like orange juice gone really bad, and then watered down.  There is a nice acidity to it, and a good amount of cheesy funk, but the weird plastic note is off putting, especially as it tends to linger on the finish covering up the funkiness.  Fades away eventually and picks up some long acid notes.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
