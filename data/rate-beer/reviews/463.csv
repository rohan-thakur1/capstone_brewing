Really looking forward to this one. I like Bells and I like stouts. I think their six-packs are a bit overpriced out here, but I like the idea of just getting a chance to try it. Prediction is between a 3.90 and 4.00 range.

Poured a black color with 2-to-3 fingers of frothy, tan head. Below average, spotty, wet lacing. Below average retention. (Sight - 3.50)

Smelled a pleasant whiff of chocolate, cocoa, chocolate malt, roasty malts, some coffee malts, Whoppers candy and chocolate milk. Very nice. (Smell - 4.50)

Taste followed the nose nicely, although not quite as good. Got fresh chocolate brownies, sugary chocolate malt, smoky fire, char wood, bitter roasted coffee malts, dark chocolate, chocolate milk shake, milky cream and Cinnabon. (Taste - 4.00)

Full body. Creamy-to-chewy texture. Average carbonation. Long finish. (Feel - 4.00)

Really liked this beer, especially for the style. Definitely some artificial stuff in there, but it works. Special Double Cream Stout is perfect for the name. (Overall - 4.00)

I expected more cream and sweetness. Actually bitter. Ok...so I got a taste of Kalamazoo alongside, and now it's more thick, creamy. Just as a random thought, but it's amazing what they produce with the Black Note. The thick creaminess of this beer blends well with Expedition. If it's just for the purpose of Black Note, which is a top three stout for me, then this beer did it's job!

463,"2014-08-22",4.0,"Transfer from BA review on 1-15-13-
S erved on tap in a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer is served a nearly pitch black color with a fine, thin tan colored head. The head fades very fast to leave only a light level of lacing.

 Smell  The aroma is on the sweeter side with a good presence of chocolate and a nice sweet lactose/milk aroma. Mixed with these smells are notes of a light coffee smell as well.

 Taste  The taste begins with some flavors of a sweet milk chocolate and a roasted malt flavor. While upfront there is a good sweet milky presence, as the taste advances the sweet loses some of its ground and the flavor becomes more bitter and darker in nature. While this occurs, some lighter earthy hop flavors start coming to the tongue. These, in the end, when combined with the more roasted, lightly sweet, and darker chocolate flavors create a very nice roasty flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the slightly thicker and chewier side with a carbonation level that is rather average. The thicker body was quite nice for the darker and roasted flavor of the brew and made it drink more like an 8-9 % abv brew as opposed to its 6.1 % abv nature.

 Overall Quite a tasty brew. Its a not too overly sweet and fairly roasty cream stout. Well worth a try.","","Darkmagus82"

Tastes range from malty, roasted hop bitter, coffee, salty, caramel, low carbonation, finishes with just a slight roasted bitter, coffee. A little tiny hint of sour grape towards the end, but I may be crazy. Does have a creaminess to the mouthfeel. Flavors are fairly tame overall nothing jumps out too much, but that's not bad, it's kept pretty balanced. The roasted tones are nice and are what dominate overall. Very drinkable.

Batch 9985: 09/14/2010

Poured to NB globe.

A: Dark ale with limited translucency and little head. Only a centralized light peanut cap evidencing the carbonation in the beer. No lacing.

S: Nice, roasty scent. Malts with hints of figs, plums, raisin. These scents are, however, quite faint. Really expect more assertiveness on the nose with this type of beer.

T: Dry stout. Little resonance of the nose into the taste of the beer. Okay beer, prefer their kalamazoo stout.

M: medium body with high carbonation. Nothing too special here.

D: Drinkable, but there are better cream stouts out there. Get the feeling this one is rated well because its Bells, not because its great.

Pours pitch black with a thick two finger dark tan head. While the head does fade there is a constant thin cap over the beer throughout. Really nice lacing all the way around.

Dark chocolate, vanilla, and caramel immediately jump out at me in the aroma. There is definitely a healthy dose of roasted barley and chocolate malt in this. No hops detectable at all. This aroma is all malt.

Tons of roast right away in the flavor. Bitter bakers chocolate along with just a hint of vanilla and some caramel. There is almost a cappuccino-like quality to this although the coffee characteristics are quite faint. Some dark fruit floats around in the background and comes forward for a split second midway through the taste. No real hop flavor but lots of bitterness reminiscent of a good strong coffee or a piece of dark chocolate. Nice thick mouthfeel with a creamy sweetness.

As expected, the age on this added some complexity to the beer. Its aroma of prunes and roast malt now mingled subtly with flavors of stone fruit, espresso, and Belgian-ness.

Deep sniffs expose more of a richness and a deeper roast and a better milk feature. The oddness seems to hang around but if you breath so damn hard that you can actually manage to lift the beer up in the glass on negative pressure alone you can find your own personal nirvana.

The aroma reveals licorice, sweet milk chocolate, creamy coffee, mild buttery biscuit, and a touch of raisin. Roasty. An interesting fruity tasty up front becoming quickly mildly sweet and creamy like a rich sour cream. The bitterness deepens as the beer warms and breathes on the palate. There is a touch of alcohol but it burns off quickly leaving a dry finish thats loaded with lingering bitterness, dry coffee-like roastiness, and a light touch of mildy tart dark fruitiness.

T - Similar to the nose with strong coffee, vanilla, and cream/lactose flavors being the strongest flavors. Some roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate comes out as well.

A- Body is a thick, deep, dark brown hue. Is served with a wonderful 1/2 finger cream colored head that eventually fades to a thin collar and leaves little lacing behind in the glass.

S- Roasted malt, vanilla, cream, coffee, and a hint of chocolate. The slightest presence of phenols as well.

T- The flavor is more typical imperial stout than imperial milk stout. Roasted coffee flavors come through first along with a smooth creamy sweetness. The finish is pretty much all roasted malt-but this doesnt get overpowering or intense in any way. A minimal roasted malt bitterness lingers on the palate.

P- Low to medium carbonation and a pretty smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The feel is great-but for the style it is a but hindered by a slight phenolic presence.

O- This is a good milk stout. Certainly a much better imperial cream stout than creme brulee. Its good-but not as good as sessionable beers of the same character. I still do like this one and will have it again.

463,"2010-03-11",3.5,"One of my favorite things about drinking beer is the moments when I try a sweet stout to top off a good dinner. A beer like Bells Special Double Cream Stout can sometimes be even more satisfying than a piece of chocolate cake because its much more complex. While I wouldnt call this a chocolate stout per se, it definitely is one of the sweetest, creamiest stouts Ive encountered. Its also surprisingly lighter in body than youd expect which makes it highly drinkable and, I think, accessible to beer drinkers of all experience levels.APPEARANCE AND AROMAI poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. I was surprised to see this beer was a dark shade of completely opaque black (no ruby red highlights at all). It formed a thick, creamy, brown head which lasted throughout the life of the drink and left some decent lacing on the glass.The aroma was surprisingly mild, although it did live up to its name as the most noticeable scent was indeed cream. There were faint hints of milk chocolate, but otherwise the nose was rather quiet.TASTEI went into Bells Special Double Cream Stout with a bit of an expectation, but was a little surprised by what I actually got. The thick creamy head was quite roasty-tasting, while the beer itself was very sweet not unlike a cola. In fact, its so sweet it actually dried out my mouth and had me craving for a sip of milk or water between each swig. Whats weird is the beer is actually not quite as rich or intense as it may sound. There is a distinct cream and milk-like combination of flavors going on, but the overall palette is rather reserved. There is mild roasted malt flavors in the mouth, although they seem to gain strength in the aftertaste. There is only faint bitterness which I would attribute to subtle notes of chocolate.DRINKABILITYThis brew is more reminiscent of an Irish Dry Stout with a sweeter body than a traditional milk stout. Its actually quite light in body, but not watery like a Guinness Draught. Still, the mouthfeel itself is velvety and smooth and the aftertaste is strong and pleasing. At 6.1% ABV Bells Special Double Cream Stout is the type of beer Id rather drink on non-special occasions and probably in greater quantities than any kind of imperial stout. I think almost anyone would find this very drinkable since its not too intense and goes down so easily. FINAL THOUGHTSSpecial Double Cream Stout is, at the very least, a solid performer. It has everything I look for in a good beer and I think its the type that would appeal to pretty much anyone. Id be surprised if it didnt.NOTE: I cannot comment on the price of this beer since it is not available where I live and was a gift from a friend from Michigan. However, Id say upwards of $13 for a six-pack would be a good value.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Nose is definitely creamy, smells like whole milk, tight roastiness, chocolate. Mouth is rich and chocolatey, nice roast throughout, light on the coffee, the sweetness and choco-vanilla notes remind me of Aphrodisiaque, but not quite so over-the-top.

463,"2010-01-22",3.9,"12 oz. bottle from The Party Source.  All right, out of the gate, I just have to say that for such a nice beer, people arent putting any effort into the ratings.  This beauty pours a really dark brown, almost black, with a small tan head that leaves some really cool lacing behind.  Aroma of chocolate, coffee, earthy hops, dark fruits, coffee, a little smoke, vanilla, and molasses.  Flavor of chocolate, fudge, vanilla, earthy hops, berries, grass, sweet roasted malts, metal, and cola.  Medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a mouthfeel thats hard to characterize- maybe sweet roasted cherry juice.  That doesnt make any sense.  Anyway, this is a really nice sweet stout, and Im starting to wonder if I mix this and Expedition Stout if I will get the highly sought-after beer with such high ratings.  Maybe.  Expedition Stout is better by itself.  Im going to see what equal parts will do...","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

The nose gives hints of roasted malt, dark chocolate, some residual sweetness, and perhaps a touch of unfermented lactose.  The palate is quite smooth and pleasing.  It lacks the sometimes abrasive roasted character and hop bitterness exhibited by other strong/sweet stouts of American origin, and instead features a lightly malty note up front, followed by a nice balancing bitterness, and a slightly sweet and almost milk chocolate-like character through the mid-palate to the finish.  Some residual sweetness fills out the beers body.  Overall, well done.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

463,"2009-08-23",2.7,"Poured from bottle to pint glass. Thick, black color with Light brown head, surprisingly not creamy and minimal retention. What was left however left some decent lace. 

Smell leaves scets of caramel and roasted coffee, and a very sweet smelling milk scent. Very appetizing. 

Initial taste is oddly very vacant as my palate struggles to get past the overcarbonation. Aftertaste thankfully has some style with a nice milky coffee flavor. The hints of flavor come out more with each sip but never manages to overcome the bubbles. 

Mouthfeel is poor, I wanted thick and smooth but the carbonation created the opposite effect. Way too thin for something I expect to coat the mouth.

While this brew goes down way too easy, why even bother? I had high hopes for this one coming in but will likely not be purchasing it again.","Donora, Pennsylvania, USA","Sonicdescent"

In many ways, this beer really does taste like a sweeter and smoother version of Kalamazoo as advertised.  A lot of good roasted nuttiness to it that i like.  Also some coffee and cream mixed with some light cocoa cereal that lingers with the roasted nuts.  Also well balanced like Kalamazoo.

The aroma I found a litttle odd, not bad, just different with coffee, licorice, grains, some dark fruit and it just seemed a little strange. Pretty good tasting beer but I didnt think there was a whole lot going on, soft creamy coffee notes up front and it gets a bit roasty in the finish. Also some molasses and chocolate mixed in there.

I have been sitting on this for over a year.  Unintentionally aging it I still had a great time sitting down with this bottle.  Bells usually does not disappoint and this is no exception.  Now I know how the blend with Expedition Stout turned out so well - both beers stand alone on their merits.  Combine them and you get a gem.

<b>Aroma / Appearance</b> - The one finger dense head suffocated the dark brown viscous body underneath.  Sticky lacing clung to the sides leaving trails of dirty film.  Caramel, chocolate and coffee melded with a smokiness that held it all together.  Open and airy it smoothly provides an offering of what is to come.

<b>Flavor / Palate</b> - The fluid dark chocolate taste of the first sip gives way to caramel, black coffee, and malt.  A little thinner than Expedition this is still stoutlike.  The smoky finish highlights a sippable winter warmer.  This would be perfect with some fine chocolate.  I may just have to get some more in the future once I thin out the cellar.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

It is like dark chocolate with a boatload of sugar in it - lots of residual malt sweetness. At mid-palate, there is some fruity and chocolatey malt and yeast character, but the sweetness is still pervasive. Some balancing bitterness shows up in the end - clean and slightly fruity. The finish is full with a bunch of chocolate and sweetened coffee and some ester and hop character providing nice, complex undertones. The mouthfeel is very full and slick - almost oily. It is a bit spritzy after it is poured, but swirling in the mouth releases gas and reveals the very full body (almost reminds me of chocolate mousse). Overall, an enjoyable sweet stout, but it is missing something - not sure what, but there is some quality to it that fails to overwhelm...","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

463,"2008-08-21",3.9,"Bells is no stranger to the stout scene. Their Kalamazoo, Java, and Expedition stouts are each glorious examples of the various stout styles, and their Double Cream Stout is a succulently smooth entry into the cream stout category.

She pours a thick-brown black and a soft cappuccino head forms and slowly lingers down to a velvety ring around my glass. Sweet milk chocolate hits me in the nose, lightly buoyed by hints of half&half and some prunes. Considering how thick she poured, I take a couple quaffs expecting it to be very viscous and full-bodied but am instead pleasantly surprised to find Special Double Cream to be well-balanced and more medium-bodied. Smooth and creamy, she glides across my tastebuds. Smooth cream, not too overly sweet leaves a pleasant lingering dry bitterness hinting at rich chocolates and fresh espresso. Very little if any prune taste in the palate. A very pleasant finish which lingers and makes me crave another quaff. I happily oblige. Smooth, creamy, reminiscent of a cool chocolate milk coffee drink, though far better. I can’t get over the finish - sweet bitter chocolate espresso. I think I enjoy the finish of the Special Double Cream Stout as much as I enjoy the overall palate and flavor profile.

I am thoroughly impressed with this beer. Delicate, well-balanced palate resplendent with smooth chocolate and espresso coffee aromas and flavors. An amazing dry finish which lingers like a chocolate truffle on my lips. Beautiful! The only way Bells Special Double Cream Stout could be any better were if I had a side plate of milk chocolate truffles and dark chocolate covered strawberries.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

At heart, it has that same marshmallow creaminess that I love in its big brother, but sweeter and more prominent in this because of the lower alcohol and less intense flavors.  Deep dark pour, with a nice rising head.  Sweet coffee, milk chocolate, and malt on the nose.  Same on the palate, with creaminess really becoming prominent.

Pours dark and rich - almost oily - with a modest tan head. Pumpernickel bread drives the aroma, some roasty coffee and chocolate. Nestle quick flavors, full and rich but a bit too chocolate syrup for my taste, rather on the sweet side. Smooth, full-bodied mouthfeel is very nice and marvelously drinkable.

How: Bottle 12oz from elmatador00, thanks a lot my friend for proposing this to one to me.
The look: Black body with a large tan head
In long: What a wonderful surprise this beer was.  Nose is somewhat smoky with roastiness, ashes and old black coffee.  Taste was just great.  Instead of the expected black chocolate I got this definite sensation of grandmas fudge.  That fudge was melting in my mouth.  That fudge is covering earthy flavours, tree branches and dry grass.  Just the right amount of dry grassy hops to dry it out without taking away from the malt profile (the main attraction here).  Amazingly drinkable, I cant imagine it grossing me out even in the long run.  In the overcrowded world of stouts its refreshing and even surprising to come across one that stands out and manages to do something different.  Thats like a rap song coming up with a new rhyme with the word fuck.  No, even more original than that, a rap song without the word fuck.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Pours black with a foamy tan head.  Very subtle cream and roasty smell on the nose.  Nice but too subtle.  Some smoke in the nose and taste as it warms only.  Fairly creamy body with light notes of coffee with cream or milk, and a roasty maltiness.  Pretty smooth overall and easy drinking.  Bittersweet creamy roast pretty much sums it up with some Kalamazoo-esque smokiness coming through as it warms.  Nice beer.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"
463,"2007-12-31",4.0,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (Batch 8223) and served in an English pint glass.  This stout poured a solid black with a thin head of dark tan foam that faded away into a single layer of bubbles.  Just a touch of lacing was left around the glass.  The aroma of the beer was made up of rich milk chocolate notes, fresh coffee, and some burnt malts.  The flavor consisted of light burnt malts and a heavy dose of creamy dark chocolate.  The mouthfeel was creamy, smooth, and medium-bodied with a nice level of carbonation.  An awsome stout that is tasty and quite sessionable as well.  One of my favorites!","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"
463,"2007-12-31",4.1,"Sampled via 12-oz bottle at Cellars Wine & Spirits in St Paul, MN. Pours an opaque dark brown brew with a thin tan head that has some nice retention and lacing. Aroma of roasted dark malt with plenty of chocolate character. Taste is smooth, creamy, full bodied, with light carbonation and flavors of roasted dark malt, dark chocolate with a touch of cream. Finish is semi-sweet with a smooth/creamy chocolate malt aftertaste. This was a pleasant surprise for a sweet stout.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"

463,"2007-12-27",4.6,"Great job yet again Bells!  This stout is delicious.  Pours like a classic stout with a nice head.  Very dark and rich.  Flavors are barely stout-bitter because of the infusion of creams in the mix.  Its chocolaty, almost like a malty milkshake but with the bite of a well brewed stout.  Definitely a great addition to any dessert.","Brunswick, Maine, USA","BeerFanDan17"
463,"2007-12-26",3.7,"Larry Bell must love stout. Oily and black when it pours. Lots of roasted malts in the aroma and a hint of coffee. A tad sweet but not something sugary for the kids. The coffee and chocolate flavors make their presence felt with a hint of smokiness and a decent dose of vanilla. Not as thick and rich as the Java and not as classically awesome as the standard Kalamazoo. This is still a beer I would never turn down, not even in July!","Durham, North Carolina, USA","Magjayran"

A tasty brew.","Columbus, Maryland, USA","franksnbeans"
463,"2007-12-23",3.7,"This brew sports a totally opaque, deep, dark mahogany brown to black body.  A loose, foamy, dark khaki colored head leaves behind dense patches of sheet-like lacing.  The aroma is very malty, and fairly complex.  Coffee, dark chocolate, scorched caramel, and roasted barley are all present in the malt base.  Heavy ream, molasses, anise, and some earthy hops add depth to the nose.  Woodsy, earthy aromas emerge as this warms to room temperature.  The flavor is very roasty, yet sweet and sugary at the same time.  Coffee and bakers chocolate provide bitterness, adding a little balance to sugary notes of scorched caramel, cream, sugar, and marshmallows.  The medium-full body comes courtesy of the heavy sugar content, and it ends up slightly sticky and cloying.  Finishes moderately long and roasty.  Sweet Stouts are not my favorite, but this one is right near the top of the genre.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

The nose is a pleasant and relatively subtle blend of dark roasted malts (10 different kinds according to the bottle), chocolate and faint coffee. The mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied and, true-to-its-name, quite creamy. It has a pleasant lingering roasted finish that remains creamy without going dry or bitter like many stouts. The flavor follows the nose with a nice blend of dark roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and cream. The only complaint that I could possibly come up with, regarding this beer, is that it isnt available year-round.

Pleasant bittersweet chocolate sweetness upfront with well-balanced malt qualities toward the rear of the palate. Light/medium carbonation and medium/full body.

Double Cream Stout poured glossy black with very minor black coffee colored edges when held to the light. A two finger drown head was produced on the pour. After some waiting and this typing it fell to a half-finger creaminess. Looks good.

Smell is strong of bitter coffee grounds. Swirls of cream are mixed in with the black coffee. Heavily roasted malts combine with the coffee notes to for a robust smelling stout. 

The flavor is actually quite a bit different than I imagined from the smell. Big roasty flavors that show up in the front and again in the finish. A milky creamines comes through in the middle along with mild coffee ground bitterness that gets stronger until it meets with the roasted malts.

I really enjoy the mouthfeel on this beer. Its medium bodied but creamy like a heavier bodied beer. Somehow on the finish theres even a little frothiness. Very nice.

Drinkability is good for a bigger stout. I can drink a couple of these in the winter time but I have to be in the right mood. I have to be in the right mood for a lot of stouts though. When I enjoy them I really enjoy them. This one is very nice.

A good solid stout overall. I thought there would be more milk chocolatiness but I was clearly wrong about that. Very nice beer to have handy on a cold night like tonight.

The lacing is very good, it leaves a film from the top of the glass to the bottom, with a head that stays around for the whole beer.  When looking at the bottom of the bottle once it is poured, this one is bottle conditioned, but looking through the glass I couldnt tell because it pours so black.  The aroma in the hops isnt much, but the malt aroma is awsome!!!   There is a really nice roasted coffee aroma along with a slight hint of chocolate.  There is also a hint of brown sugar.  With the first taste it is very sweet with light bitterness.  Then the finish is also quite sweet with a little bitterness to back it up.  The duration of the finish is pretty long, (the bitterness is that of a medium roast coffee.)  The body is extreamly full with a silky smooth creamy texture and very soft carbonation.

463,"2007-04-14",2.3,"NorCal tasting Apr 07 - This is the 2nd beer from Bells that I really didnt care too much for. Pours out a jet black liquid with a nice off-white two-finger creamy head. Aroma that hit me first was a smokey character. After that, some chocolate, coffee and finally wound up smelling like a meat marinade of some kind. Flavor was lactic, dark chocolate, some coffee in there. It had an odd sourness to it that I found off-putting. Perhaps a bad bottle? Afterall I did receive it in a trade so I dont know how long it was made or where it was sitting. Bells makes too many other good beers for me to think any less of them.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

Slight head of dusk white, with lacing to frighten even the most pure of heart.  A sinister aroma of coffee-infused chocolate permeates the silence;  can you hear the creaking of the staircase?  Layers of velvety chocolate and coffee caress the tongue like the soft hands of a clock at midnight; the bell tolls for thee, my friend.  Notes of roasted nut and caramel seem to pierce the darkness.  The palate is tickled by spikes of nutty coffee and chocolate.

Some friends and I decided to have a beer tasting and discussion and this was one of my choices. I can say that I am glad I took a chance on this one. Opened a chilled bottle and poured into a large glass. The beer was dark and had a nice lighter color head. Once I let the foam settle, I took a sniff and was surprised that it didnt smell really burnt or roasted. Took a sip and was surprised at the smoothness. It didnt have a bitter taste or aftertaste to it. The flavor had hints of chocolate and coffee to it. A very enjoyable brew.","Redford, Michigan, USA","CanisFirebrand"

________________________________
I take back what I said! Turns out that the reason it tasted chalky is because I drank it out of mulike stein.  Much better in an eglish pint.  Very good sout.

463,"2007-02-05",3.4,"Poured a nice brown/black with a thin layer of bubbly tan head. At first the aroma seemed somewhat muted, but that was probably because it was too cold. As it warmed up, the beer revealed its lovely sweet coffee and milky aroma, with chocolate creeping in there at times. Unfortunately, the taste didnt quite follow through. I had to really swirl it around for a while before I could get a real definitive taste. Beforehand, it didnt really have much of a taste, maybe a faint milkiness at best. After doing so, there was a bit of coffee and malty sweetness. I let it warm up some more, but it didnt do much good. What it did do however, was accentuate the finish, which also ended up being very good. It was way more pronounced, yielding a delicious sweet coffee flavor without too much bitterness.  Based on the aroma I had high hopes for this one, but the taste just didnt deliver.  On the bright side, the finish was almost certainly the best aspect of this beer, suitable for all tastes (unless youre really averse to coffee). I just hope I got a subpar batch.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"

463,"2007-01-13",4.3,"This beer pours so dark, it is like a black hole - light may enter, but none escapes. I hold it up to the light in my kitchen, and absolutely no light passes through. I can tell by the bubbles that are in contact with the side of the glass that the beer is clear, however. The head is a pretty dark - about the same color as brown sugar. The head does not stick around, it diminishes to a scattering of various sized bubbles on the surface.

The smell is pretty good. For some reason, I expected it to be stronger, but still I detect a roastiness and alcohol scent. The alcohol reminds me of brandy.

Ahhh... the taste. Big bold unsweetened bitter chocolate, espresso, and a plum-brandy flavor. Fantastic. Sweet too - like brown sugar and maybe some kind of dark honey. There is a certain smokiness to it too, nothing like a rauchbier smokiness, more earthy. Maybe like tobacco (but a good cigar, not a Marlboro).

Thick bold mouthfeel, with very lttle presence of carbonation (though I can see its there).

The coffee/chocolate roastiness and some hops linger for a long time on my palate. A trace of maple?","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"

The aroma was sweet malt, alcohol, chocolate and roast.  The flavor was not as complex as i thought it would be.  I expected a stream of powerful flavors.  The alcohol wasnt as prominent as in the aroma.  It was more bitter than sweet with a lot of malty flavor.  There was a roasted taste as well.  The palate was medium thickness and the finish had a mineral/roasty taste.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","aubreya"
463,"2007-01-12",3.7,"Courtesy of brewblackhole. Pours a wonderful black, Id like for it to be a little more viscous to get that 5. The head is fairly generous (although my pint has a narrow top), creamy, and tan leaving a nice sliding lace. The aroma is not quite what I would like. Definite roast with some malt character,  and something that smells like cooked cereal. Not a bad aroma, just a little toned down. After it warms alcohol begins to rear its head The flavor follows, has serious potential but lacks that little umph that would put it over the top. Alright, lets describe. Definitely a roasted taste, no doubt about it, maybe some coffe, no detectable hop, and the alcohol shows itself if you wait a few seconds between sips. The palate is odd in that it is very full and smooth/velvety while at the same time having a lackluster thinness in the background, maybe Im imagining it. The finish is smooth as well with alcohol showing between sips as with flavor.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"

In fact, after twenty minutes of the glass being left to sit (poured far too cold), the head hadnt budged even the slightest. Aroma shines here, with an even, almost textbook blend of roasted, chocolate and caramel malts, and lesser hops and molasses and tobacco. This even smells creamy. Flavor is expectedly good, Bells pulls no punches with the stout family. Taste is just as evenly balanced as the aroma, sweet though it is. Palate is damn near perfect, carbonation is mouth-filling but not excessive. Finishes roasty with just enough dryness to bring me quickly back for another sip.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

463,"2006-12-22",3.8,"On tap at Capital Ale House - Innsbrook.  A very smooth stout.  Dark black in color with a very brown head.

463,"2006-12-19",3.1,"UPDATED: NOV 16, 2009 Batch 7250 ~ Packaged on February 14, 2006
12/19/2006:  Bells Special Double Cream Stout is nearly black in color with a large light brown head.  The aroma is mostly cream with just a hint of roasted malt.  The flavor is also very creamy with some chocolate and/or coffee (something dark and roasted).  There is a bit of something fruity midway through the flavor.  The finish has a slightly burnt, coffee-like acidic bitterness.  This beer has a medium body, moderate carbonation, and is very smooth and creamy on the palate.  This is a well balanced sweet stout and would probably go great with with some chocolate...  Actually, I just grabbed some semi-sweet chocolate and Im eating some now.  Now for another sip of this beer...  Interesting, but not so good.  A lot more of that fruity, sour  apple-like flavor and some alcohol come out.  I have also just discoverd a bunch of sludge in the bottom of my glass and it seems a bit overcarbonated.  I wonder if this bottle is past its prime?  I remember this brew being much better and richer than this...  I think I will have to seek out a fresher bottle next time and re-visit this beer!

Batch 7684 ~ Packaged on October 16, 2006
11/16/2009:  Bells Special Double Cream Stout...  Aroma:  Hints of chocolate, dark fruits, a hink of souring cream; slighty roasty.  Appearance:  Opaque, deep brown color (like the color of a milk chocolate bar) with a formidable and lasting tan-colored head.  Flavor:  Stale chocolate; some roasted malts; bittersweet; dry roasted malts; touches of sour dark fruits; roasted chesnut throughout the finish (nice!).  Palate: Medium-full body; smooth and milky; more body than typically for this style which is nice to see.  Overall:  Its still just okay; I am not a big fan of milk stouts and this one really doesnt do it for me either, but its better than most...

463,"2006-12-16",4.5,"Bells Special Double Cream Stout
12 oz bottle
Packaged 10/06, milked 12/06
Moderate pour in an English pint

Poured black with mahogany highlights with a light brown frothy mostly lasting head with good lacing.

Smelt of burnt grain, sour milk, dark coffee,  and dark chocolate, light fruity dark plums or blackberries,.

Taste was upfront strong bitter burnt taste and moderate sweet coffee and cream followed by a strong bittersweet dark chocolate, toffee , soy, and anise.   Palate was full bodied, softly carbonated, creamy, coating and silky smooth, with moderate astringency and light alcoholic feel.

Overall,  this is a great balance of sweet and bitter in a stout.  The flavors are exploding all over my tastebuds like a fireworks display.  Its the softest beer on the palate Ive yet to have, like licking a Playmates buttocks.  Creaminess is kinda odd though and reminds me of sour milk.  It all works wonderfully though.","Midland, MI, Michigan, USA","xav33"

The aroma isnt is sweet as Id have thought from the description.  Up front is dark, roasty malts and acidic coffee.   There is also some unsweetened cocoa.  The flavor is also pretty roasty, especially in the dry finish.  Sweetness does not dominate here, though makes an appearance up front and midway through.  Not as acidic as the aroma leads on.  I think I picked up on a bit of apples and sour cherries, though these are quite faint.  Medium to full bodied, light to moderate carbonation, creamy mouthfeel.

463,"2006-12-01",2.9,"Classified as a sweet stout and I generally like sweet stouts, however, I have been very let down with other highly rated Bell beers so I have some aprehension. Once I cracked the lid I didnt notice any outstanding aroma. 12 oz brown bottle pours thick and dark but not as thick and dark as Mackesons xxx.  First taste is not initially bitter, pretty smooth actually.  Does have some hop or malt hints. Not real bitter like other Bell stouts and is very acceptable.  Could have a bit more carbonation, but I think this level of carbonation is proper for a sweet stout. Finish is OK with a hint of lingering malty bitterness something like a Moretti La Rossa.  Just perhaps, this is a bit smoother than Sammy Adams Cream stout.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

Balanced attack of light sweetness and light bitterness with a splash of stout sourness in the bg.  End and aftertaste are dry and mildly bitter, gritty roast calmed by smooth creaminess.

Luxurious on the tongue, this beer is really very nice indeed.  It foams up, and theres a slight alcohol warming which I think always goes hand in hand with beers of substance.  Sweet, though not an all-out maltfest.  Theres again some of that berry, but its overwhelmed by the charcoal roast.  Some cream and lactic acidity again.  the finish is dry for such a sweet stout and dominated by charcoal.  I love a roasty beer, but this brew may go so far so as to obscure its more subtle points.

The finish brings out a little of that faintly vegetal note Ive noticed in their rye stout and more predominantly in their porter, but its not bad, I probably only noticed it because I was specifically weary of it after the porter.

463,"2006-02-02",4.1,"Deep malt aroma. Heavy on the chocolate malted milk, roasted-almost-burnt grains with a carbonic tang. Smoky undertones and coffee bitters infused with fresh milk. Dark brown-black clear with thin tan head that dissipates quickly. Pours like it gonna be thick, and thats confirmed in the first sips. Heavy bodied, not quite chewy but definitely a mouthful. Would be velvety if the carbonation were toned down just a bit. Starts thick with competing attention from roasted sweet maltiness, bitter coffee-chocolate mix, thin smokiness, and carbonic acidic tang. Sweetness prevails to the finish, with dry roasted bitterness and mild carbonic sourness to boot. Poured some of the sediment in and it was the difference between filtered and French press coffee. The taste didnt vary too much, other than to have a smoother, silkier finish and mouthfeel - got a little chewier. The bitterness and tang toned down a bit, and was replaced by more steady dry nuttiness to offset the chocolatey malts. Nice stout.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"

There is almost a melted ice cream feel to this in the aroma and also the taste. Its very creamy (though not as creamy as the name would lead you to beleive). There is virtually no bitterness or hops to this beer. I m almost at a loss to describe this further. Its full and tasty, but at the same time nearly devoid of anything signifigant or overpowering. As acertain said, its well balanced - neither sweet nor bitter. Dont get me wrong, its very good and seems fitting for its name.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"

I was expecting huge creaminess, afterall, just look at the name. The alcohol content is hard to detect, which I like. Nothing worse than a beer thats more like a hard liqour.

Much closer to their porter than the Kzoo stout. Mouthfeel is outstanding, lush and velvety. Nothing too complex, but solid. Cant believe this is 7.5% ABV. Begins to sweeten up a bit as it warms.

I havent had a lot of cream stouts, but among those I have had, this is the finest. The lack of roasted notes suprised me, although this allowed the chocolate and vanilla flavors to shine through.

463,"2005-10-04",3.2,"UPDATED: OCT 5, 2005 I was just telling my psychologist how I used to force grasshoppers to eat things when I was a kid. (Just kidding about the psychologist). Grasshoppers create this weird tobacco spit-froth while they eat. I suppose these are things you learn when you spend long summers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Anyhow, this stout reminded me of, yes, grasshopper spit.  Very dark with not much of a head. Very sticky. I could detect some alcohol in this one. Nice faint smell of roasted malt and molasses. Smooth down the pipe. Real smooth. Im embarrassed to admit this might be a little too earthy for me personally. Nice hop flavor on the front, backed up by pure malt. Great finish.  This is well done. Just a little bit over the top for my wimpy tastes.

Beautifully balanced flavors of dark chocolate, more roasted malt, smooth coffee and just a hint of alcohol.  Finish was long, sweet and had a touch of vanilla.  Bells brews are next to impossible to find in south jersey and I found this gem at the Foodery in Philly.  I know where Im going tomorrow.......","Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA","GuilTTy"
463,"2005-02-25",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 26, 2005 Thanks to Mr. Facto for this beer.

Ah, its been so long since Ive had a Bells Stout... Ive been looking forward to this.  As I open the bottle, I am instantly hit with the powerful aroma of cream and chocolate, with just the smallest hint of coffee.  Ive never smelled a stout quite like this.  It poured black with a creamy tan head.  (Should I expect anything less from Kalamazoo?)  As I bring the stout to my lips, something interesting happens.  Unlike Kalamazoo Stout or Expedition, which blanket the mouth, Double Cream slips like water on a ducks back across my tongue and down my throat.  Wow, this is the smoothest stout Ive ever had.  Its so smooth that I have to actually swish it in my mouth to get the full flavor, which is coffee with half and half and a touch of sugary chocolate.  This literally could supstitute a cafe breve (thats a cappuccino with steamed half and half instead of milk).  The aftertaste is mostly coffee.  In the world of the stouts, my alliance has always been most firmly with the camp of the sweet.  And this is the creamiest sweet stout Ive had the pleasure of trying.  If I have one complaint with this beer, its that I wish the body were as full as its aforementioned counterparts, Kalamzoo and Expedition.  If this beer had that body, it would truly be the holy grail of sweet stouts.  But being so damn close still makes this a beer worth seeking out.  Im now very thankful that Facto sent me two, for I have one to save for another occasion.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

463,"2005-02-20",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2006 RERATE: Im digging this more than last time. Pours black as death with a large light brown head. Aroma of mocha, roastiness, smoke, hops and a tinge of sourness. The flavor starts off with massive notes of mocha/chocolate, sweet caramel, roastiness then gives way to a little lactic sourness and a bit of saltiness - pretty interesting. Moderately sweet. Roasty coffee, chocolate ice cream aftertaste. Very creamy, lush and silky with lively small-beaded carbonation which makes the flavor gently ripple over your tongue. Lacing hangs on the glass in sheets, decent head retention. Great stuff. Bells gets my vote for King of Stout.","Ashburn, Virginia, USA","jasonp"
463,"2005-02-18",3.9,"Tap at Blue Nile, Minneapolis.  Gorgeous looking stout.  Couldnt discern much aroma.  I agree with Wawood that it feels nothing like 7.5% alcohol, as the lightly creamy body brings forth light milk chocolate and decaf folgers--not any alcohol flavor to be found.  Rather light in flavor for the rich name, but a tasty treat nonetheless.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","ChrisPants"

Minimal head that dissipates to a thin layer of dark amber bubbles.  Nose is awesome... just like walking into a real coffee shop (not Starbucks) that has 100 year old wooden walls and the old aromas have buried themselves in their surroundings and yet they still mesh with the new aromas from the freshly brewed coffees and teas of today and create a great atmosphere.... Thats the nose of this beer.   Sweet and malty and cocoa and vanilla, and .... Im missing something, but the aroma rocks.  Body is creamy and smooth with slight and fizzy carbonation. The taste is sweet with a slight twang that rides down the throat with the heavy espresso flavor... not perfect, but not bad.  Not sure what that twang is, and it doesnt ruin the brew, but it does keep from being top-notch in my book.  Not bad stuff, but doesnt finish as well as dry or imperial stouts.

463,"2004-12-30",3.6,"Jet black in colour with a small off white head. The aroma is dominated by sweet chocolate (think chocolate chips), with more subtle notes of espresso, roasted malt, and a fruit element that I cant quite identify (perhaps plum?). Upon drinking, the chocolate becomes a little less sweet, and takes on more of a powedered cocoa flavor. Theres also a bit of a yeasty note with a bit of leafy hop bitterness at the end. The sweetness is a little less than I expected, but well within stylistic guidelines. I had hoped for a bit more body too, but again, its not as if its thin.

Doesnt finish with much luster and makes me wonder whats missing.  Thank you for this treat, Jeff.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

463,"2003-12-16",3.6,"UPDATED: NOV 16, 2011 Sampled November 2011
A vigorous pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a three-finger thick, frothy textured, brown head that leaves lots of lacing on the sides of my glass. The beer is a black, concentrated brown color and  is quite opaque. Rich malt aromas of blackened caramel, concentrated coffee, slightly tart roast / burnt notes, some sort of rich, cold coffee drink, dark chocolate and cocoa are all quite noticeable in the nose.  There seem to be some touches of roasted butterscotch here as well.

The beer feels thick and viscous, but lightens up as moves across the palate. A dry and roasted note in the finish is what allows this to lighten up and it serves as a nice foil for the dark malt sweetness up front.  This beer is roasted, burnt and slightly bitter throughout the flavor profile, but, especially towards finish.  The finish has a lingering toasted / roasted brown grain-bread character to it that adds some whole grain wholesomeness to the beer.  The texture has a smooth and creamy feel to it up front, but the middle gets a touch prickly from the carbonation, but also it is accentuated by some burnt tartness. Burnt toffee flavors up front meld well with some roasted nutty notes. The finish has some tartness from the ample roast malt.

This is much nicer than my previous encounter with a much too buttery version of this beer. This definitely hits the spot if you are in the mood for an amply roasted, but chewy, smooth stout.
Sampled December, 2003
Previous Score = 3, 5/4/5/4/12
This beer pours a deep brown, almost a black, color.  It forms a thick brown head when swirled in my glass.  The aroma is of a buttery roast malt.  The butter seems to dominate the aroma.  The butter component is in the taste as well.  This beer is creamy in consistency.  It has definite roast character as well, though befitting a cream stout, it is a soft roast flavor.  The stout is fairly thick bodied, with notes of coffee and chocolate.  The butter flavor seems to dissipate with time, though I could just be getting used to it.  I am not sure if the butter character is supposed to be here (my guess is that it is not), but it is no so strong that it horribly detracts from this beer.  It even helps to boost the perceived fullness of this beer.  Though in the end this beer would be much better without the butter component.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Aroma doesnt climb out of the glass to meet you, but lingers, inviting, with definite aromas of chocolate and pine.  The flavors roll through the mouth, spruce in the beginning, followed by loads of semi-sweet and milk chocolates.  As it warms, the spruce fades, and black cherries begin to emerge.  I wish stuff like this was brewed in my area.  RERATE:  I have tried this repeatedly over the years, and I should note that I think my early exuberance for this beer is slowly fading a bit.  My palate has become jaded by a tidal wave of imperials that leave the more subtle complexities of this beer gasping for air.  So if I had to be totally objective, I probably would lower this rating.  And probably fairly significantly.

The beer pours DARK black with a small, light brown head.  The aroma, as with most stouts is of strong coffee and a slight sweetness.  The flavoring is amazing - coffee, chocolate, fruits, malt, vanilla, it's all there.  Finishes smoothly with a little alcohol on the tongue and a very slight bitter flavoring.

Not an exceptional aroma and not suggesting the strong burst of roasted, chocolate, almost mocha coffee-like flavors.  I thought this was much more dry than I expected.  A bit of tang, almost a hint of sour before the roasted bitterness takes over in the finish.  I attribute that to the cream but other than a hint in the aroma and this odd flavor combination, I didn't pick up as much cream as I would have thought (and I've had a good bit of high-quality cream in my day).","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

463,"2003-02-01",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 1, 2004 Updated 13 October 2003
Time to replace an earlier vague review.  Double Cream Stout is perhaps my favorite beer.  Pours deep brown with a thin tan head. Plenty of ""floaties."" Aroma is roasted malts with hints of sweet lactose.  The new label indicates this stout is brewed with 10 malts, so the flavor is quite interesting.  Roasted, slightly burnt chocolate rules the palate, and is infused with sweet and tangy notes of lactose and perhaps hints of dark fruit.  Licorice also peeks through the creamy morass.  Medium-thick body.  Always a treat and a major reason to look forward to fall.  However, what happened to the labels?  Bring back the orange and cream! 
Updated 1 November 2004.  On to the Fall 2004 release.  One thing about Bells is that their beers are not necessarily consistent year to year.  While I liked the 2003 Double Cream Stout, every bottle I sampled (from several sources) had a dominant licorice-like flavor that masked the roasted-sweet interplay, not what I remembered from 2002 and prior years, when this became my favorite beer.  The 2004 version is exactly as I first remember this beer.  Rich, soft roasted malts with hints of coffee and chocolate, much like the regular Kalamazoo Stout, but with a sweet, fruity (cherry) characteristic (lactose?) undeveloped in the former beer.  Rich, velvety, and amazing.  I can now once again state with confidence that this is my favorite beer.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

Excellent.  Very smooth all the way down and at 7.5% it is easy to get carried away with this beer because it goes down so well.  Recommended.","California, USA","stephen"

463,"2002-11-23",3.5,"UPDATED: SEP 19, 2016 Previous review from draft:  Huge roasted aroma with lots of caramel, raisin, cocoa, coffee, and plum.  A hint of leather is in there as well.  Super slick, velvety, creamy, and soft palate.  Complex flavors of chewy caramel and a roasted chocolate middle.  Finished with a mild acidic snap and a medicinal blue cheese richness.  The bitter chocolate rounds this out nicely. (8, 4, 8, 4 = 4.0)  A revisit still finds the body  a wee thin, and halfway through the bottle the sugars become semi-fatiguing. Blessedly soft maltiness shows faint complementary grip of roast, yet predominant prune, licorice and lactic notes detract from the richer maltiness and keep this from becoming decadent and luxurious.  Still quite solid and enjoyable, but its just too sweet for me to wanna revisit more than once or twice a year. Curiously thin, too, which leaves the drinker somewhat dissatisfied, even after the sugary onslaught.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

It is smoky for sure, just like their porter, but somehow less enjoyable in this.  Sure there are other qualities to this like chocolate and coffee but the smoked taste is a bit too much for me.  Ill go for their Expedition or if I want a little more sweetness, Sam Smiths Oatmeal is hard to beat.","Michigan, USA","softale"
463,"2002-10-13",3.9,"I had this at the brewery, and maybe something was off because I at first I thought this might have been a smoked beer.  The beer was as dark as a beer gets.  Started out with good notes of chocolate, roasted malt, alcohol, coffee, and sugar.  After the beer warmed I noticed distinct smoked flavors, like bacon.  It didnt detract from the beer, but was surprising.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"

463,"2002-07-12",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 22, 2005 Bells double cream stout is the perfect dessert beer.  This is the one beer that you would be most tempted to create an ice cream float with.  The chocolate and roasted barley blend perfectly to produce a well balanced malt flavor - excellent hop balance.  The head tend to be a lot darker than many stouts.  A friend of mine who is a confirmed Budweiser drinker, makes this his only exception.  This might rerate at a perfect 5 someday in the future.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","Inveigler"

I dont find this beer to be too sweet in the least, not sure this is much of a cream stout, but who cares, at 7.5% ABV and this taste, they could call it a shandy and i wouldnt care!  

2002 bottle.  Very strange yet good. Tons of black malt, oily, roasty, slightly bitter.  More like a porter this year, though surprisingly, the chocolate flavor is not sweet.  Quite bitter and lightly yeasty.  Different than the 2001, but still quite good.  

2003 bottle.  Wonderful it remains.  Some more roast than I remember, which is nice.  Good burnt flavor, like a smore without the marshmallow.  Nice chocolate flavor on the finish not overdone.  Much drier.  Great appearance, large dark oily brown head.  Maybe a touch of thinning as it warms.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

463,"2001-08-27",4.1,"So we had cans of Beamish, bottles of Anchor Porter, and this lovely stout - not a bad evening and the double cream held up well in the excellent company.  Its sharp and roasty at first and sweetens and softens as it goes, perhaps too much as at the end I was left feeling a bit cheated, missing some of the complexity of the top notch stouts Ive had.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
