1923,"2015-08-09",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 10, 2015 Pale ale from this classic Colorado brewery, pouring a clear, warm orange to almost amberish colour sustaining a big, frothy, rocky, thickly cobweb lacing, cream white head; adding the deposit leads to a warm cloudy amber robe. Inviting, fruity-hoppy aroma of orange peel, lots of fragrant field flowers, gooseberries, hint of roasted pine nuts, freshly cut grass and nettles (feeling a bit Belgian, actually), pleasantly meaty hint of chicken broth, pink grapefruit, green olives, toasted bread, tad lychee or melon from fruity hops. Clean, subduedly fruity onset, exotic touch but not overly so, hints of melon, lychee and kiwi, soft carbo, smooth, oily and slick mouthfeel, slick caramelly malt sweetishness, bit toasted, pleasant, leading to a finish of this malt sweetishness continuing but being countered with resiny, piney, fruity, citrussy hops, very aromatic retronasally with all those wonderful odours returning, as well as gently bittering, not harshly so, but in an English kind of way, providing some balance but allowing the smooth maltiness to finish it off, though the refined hoppiness, even leaving a kind of lime peel effect deep in the throat after swallowing, is obviously hard to ignore. Very agreeable beer, not boasting complexity or depth, but cleverly made with a perfect feeling for balance and not showing any flaws at all. Delightful on a summer afternoon and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to explore the regular pale ale style before (or after) venturing into the hoppier IPA culture. Though apparently labelled an EPA here, to me it still comes across more as an APA, but whatever the style, this is a lovely beer.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

A sharp bitter bite hits on the first sip but quickly mellows out, allowing a light caramel flavor to hold sway along with pine resin, prominent cereal grains, a touch of hay, and a minor (and surprising) rye-like spiciness. Despite the bitter start, the overall taste is well balanced. Likewise, the medium palate stays right down the middle with a slightly smooth texture and a moderate finish that concluded with a touch of bitterness.

1923,"2013-04-23",3.6,"12oz Bottle. The pour was a cloudy medium orange with an average (1-2 finger) off white creamy head that slowly reduced, down to a large puddle of foam with a medium collar which produced excellent streaky lacing.

The aroma was of biscuit malts, floral hops and an earthy yeast with notes of caramel, toffee, citrus (grapefruit and tangerine) and a light tropical fruity ester (pineapple).

The taste was lightly sweet and rather malty with a touch of caramel and a bold fruitiness from the start, but quickly progressed into a much hoppier taste with a superb bitter citrus ending. The flavor lasted for a long while proceeding the swallow with a light sweetness hanging on, but not to be overdone by the bitter citrus flavor that eventually outlasted and lingered for a while longer.

Mouthfeel was a step or two above light in body and distinctly dry in texture with a carbonation that was just about medium in intensity.

Thanks to someone for sending me this in a recent trade. I set it aside to open without delay because not only was a light sessionable beer it actually sounded appealing. After two or three offerings from Odell I have a feeling I will be seeking out more. How theyve flown under the radar for so long is really a mystery.

Aroma / Appearance - The mandarin orange body shimmered with life. Mostly foam at first it took a while to settle into something that resembled a beer. Chunks of head, like tan icebergs, remained. Bright melony hops mixed with orange glo and pine sol. Smelling like a freshly waxed hardwood floor it is vibrant and alive.

Flavor / Palate - Slightly resiny orange juice washed across the palate. Balanced with a bias towards the hops it sparkles on the tongue. Mildly bitter in the finish it leaves a mark instead of fading away feebly. If I opened the fridge to find a six pack of these it would not be the worst discovery.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Their IPA was mild enough, even for me, and so is this one, though the Barrel Pale Ale does have a slightly different flavor profile.  Off-white head, and a basic pale ale bronze color give body to the deep well of flavors.  Caramel, peanut butter, honey and a general roastiness give this only slightly hop edged beer a definitively good aroma.  Likewise, the flavor, mainly nuttiness, with black pepper and a little caramel keep the general taste alive but pacified, making this O’Dell a deeper, roastier version of the IPA with equal talent for easy but tasty drinking.

1923,"2006-12-10",3.4,"Pours with a frothy, slightly creamy consistency, initially two-finger thick, tan colored head.  The beer is a lightly hazy, red tinted, full amber color.  The aroma is nice and hoppy up front, about what one would expect for a hoppy pale ale.  The hops are clearly American with citrus notes of grapefruit, sweet orange peel and even a touch of apricot.  There are some chewy malt aromatics towards the end that remind me of caramelized crystal malts and some dry, toasty, biscuit malt character.

The taste is lightly sweet up front, more so from the citrus-like hop notes than from an overabundance of unfermented malt though.  Notes of grapefruit and tangerine define the citrus components but there is a touch of herbaceous pine as well as a hint of menthol in the finish.  This has a nice medium bitterness to it that causes my tongue to buzz a bit after the beer has left my mouth.  The malt plays a supporting role here, but there are some noticeable toffee notes as well as a generally caramelized malt character & even some biscuit like toasted malt notes peek out from time to time.

This beer is quite light and easy drinking.  I could definitely see myself knocking back a few of these during a session.  Of course it is light and interesting enough to be used as that beer that one starts out the night with, before moving on to more powerful beers.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Would like to see on tap.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
1923,"2005-09-25",3.2,"Cloudy orange pour that is inviting enough. The aroma is of hops and grain, though a bit muddled. Pleasant enough balance between bittering hops and sweet malts, but this flavor is not one to make your taste buds stand up and pay attention. There was a slight tendency toward a syrupy mouthfeel. Overall, nice drinking beer, slightly above average.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"
1923,"2005-09-19",2.7,"On tap at the Crescent Moon Alehouse. Pours the color of a glass of ice tea. Mild while head. Hoppy and slightly fruity aroma. But not the citrus type of fruit. Flavor is slightly uninspiring. Balance is not so great and it seems a litle watery. Well-hopped, but by no means a hop-head beer. Drinkable, but looks and tastes a little too much like a glass of ice tea.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","SledgeJr"
1923,"2005-09-15",4.5,"On tap from Wymans Number Five in Denver: Very hoppy with well-balanced bitterness and malty sweetness.Slight fruity notes. I wouldnt have known this existed if it werent for the coaster the waitress put down. Im glad she did. I need to find this in bottles and have them shipped to me in Nebraska.","USA","weisinator"
1923,"2005-09-03",3.4,"Just had the Cutthroat Pale Ale!  Now Im ready for the new kid on the block!  Light amber hue with good head at first, but little retention.  Sporadic medium bubbles clingling to the side of the glass.  Sweet, sweet hop nose with a lil maltiness bringing up the rear.  Man, flagrant hop aroma!  Word of the day, Hops!  Sweet hops, well, sweet and dry hops.  Very little malt notes, but somehow a coffee note crossed my palate.  More of an American pale as far as the hops are concerned.  Drying mouth feel.  As opposed to a malt/hop balance, I guess that a sweet/dry hop balance is in effect.  I still love this brewery and this beer is no exception!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","sneagrams3"
1923,"2005-08-29",3.1,"somewhat hoppy, carmel flavor, small head, and a bit weak for my taste, kind of plain for being so hoppy, nothing special","Westchester, New York, USA","PBOYNY"
1923,"2005-08-24",3.2,"Pour is orange with a small white head.  Aroma is of nice fresh hops.  Flavor is nice a hoppy and typical of the style.  Pretty decent and quite tasty.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
1923,"2005-07-30",2.7,"had both the regular and a nitro version at the brewery.  the nitro was actually more pleasant. that surprised me.im listing just my notes from the regular tap because i dont know if it was a one off with the nitro tap. this pours a light copper tan with a citrus aroma and a bit of tangerine. a tart almost sour lemon  lime  notes mix with something malty, but the malt loses in this battle, a grassy sweet and still bitter finish.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
1923,"2005-07-24",3.2,"On draft at Yia Yias in Lincoln NE.  Hazy dark orange with a wisp of a head.  Only a hint of any aroma; the flavor is citric and bitter, but with a smooth finish.  Average but fairly good American pale ale.","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"
1923,"2005-07-17",3.3,"Pours medium yellow with fair white head that quickly diminishes.  Nose is bright and floral, very hoppy.  The flavor is dominated by crystal hops, with some nice malt balance and just a hint of smokiness.  My bottle had little ascerbic ketone character.  Not complex but good.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","jgentgesdo"
1923,"2005-07-15",2.9,"Pours med. amber with a slightly off-white fluffy head. Aroma is of piney hops and some malty cookieness. Flavor is oxidized, med sweet with a fresh hopsack grassiness and alas a huge smack of diacetyl. Body is med light. Bitterness is there but restrained, maybe 30-35 IBUs. A bit more might help cover up the diacetyl problem.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","erway"
1923,"2005-07-11",2.7,"(Tap, Crescent Moon)  Pours an amber body with a small white head.  Aroma of vegetables, citrus, and a bit skunky.  Flavors of sweet and hoppy, but unbalanced.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
1923,"2005-07-05",3.4,"Bottled.  Fresh, flowery, fruity hop aroma with doughy, biscuity, faintly sweet malts in the background and hints of cedar.  Medum copper color, clear, with a fine, lasting, creamy head and densely spotted lace.  Hoppy, lightly citric, bitter and fruity flavor, progressing toward a balanced finish as some toasty, lightly sweet maltiness appears to mingle with the green, leafy hop and light, almost pear-like fruitiness.  Finely effervescent and refreshing palate with a medium body.  True, nothing too special but appropriate for this time of year in particular.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
1923,"2005-07-02",2.8,"12 oz bottle-pours a deep orange hue with a small white head.  metalic hop notes with notes of peppers-chipolte and berries.  odd aroma but its actually not bad.  Probably pretty good fresh as well.  flavors are where this beer goes wrong-very boring, bland and slightly oxidized as well.  no finsih to speak of.  this is definately a downfall from the decent cutthroat pale.  odell, you need HELP!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
1923,"2005-06-26",3.8,"Tap @ 16th Colorado Brewfest.  Pours copper to amber with a huge foamy off-white head.  Oaked caramel malt aroma with a fruity hop nose.  Pine hop and caramel malt flavor.  Medium bodied and creamy.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
1923,"2005-06-24",3.2,"On tap: Pours a clear copper with a thick, well-lacing off-white head.  Aroma has a nice, fresh hoppiness and hints of sweet caramel malt.  Body starts mildly sweet, thinning some toward a dry, semi-bitter, crisp hoppy finish.  Not much complexity or flavor going on here but it is quite drinkable.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1923,"2005-05-09",3.3,"Tap at FR.  Muted fruity hop aroma.  Hoppy for Odells I suppose(and that is what the bar tender said too)...some leafy-ness and toasty malt.  Excellant lace.  A good hoppy pale ale, but nothing more.","Nebraska, USA","mdi"
1923,"2005-03-21",2.8,"On tap at Falling Rock.  Pours a translucent amber color.  Aroma is of very light malts, and a tinge of floral hops.  Taste is nothing to get excited about...maybe some citrus hops, light malts.  Finishes up dry....nothing really bad---or great about this one.  It failed to offend.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BrockLanders"
1923,"2005-03-19",3.2,"My first, and only, rating so far in 2005.  I had one on tap.  Its a standard hoppy ale, nothing spectacular but it works.  And since I live near the brewery, my pint was very fresh and I think that a hoppy beer like this is best consumed fresh.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
1923,"2005-03-16",3.5,"Growler.  Pours a light amber with a medium off-white head.

The aroma is caramel malts and fresh hops.

The flavor is malts with some reserved green hops.  It has a nice dry-hopped finish that gives some good hop burps.  It is medium to light bodied.

Overall, its a good mild American Pale Ale.  The American hops differentiate it quite a bit from the English hops in the Cutthroat Pale.  I like the dry hopped flavor.  I wish it was even hoppier!","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"
1923,"2005-03-13",3.2,"Pours a light amber gold with an offwhite head.  Theres a definite citrus quality followed by perhaps a ""white grape"" bitterness (perhaps apricot) and a bit of caramel (ESB-ish).  This is thin for an APA, and it is a bit too acidicly sweet.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","KarmanGhia"
1923,"2005-02-28",3.1,"UPDATED: AUG 20, 2014 Bottle. Head is initially average sized, fizzy/frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is light amber. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain, cookie), moderately hoppy (orange, apricot, flowers). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively/soft carbonation, slightly metallic. Fairly nice aroma, but kinda thin and watery and a little sour and metallic too. Has potential, but also has problems.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1923,"2005-02-16",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 15, 2005 On tap at Falling Rock: Very clear and medium amber. Toasty malts. Flowery hops, with notes of citrusy orange and grass. Dryish finish. Hints of earth and yeast in the aftertaste.Very nicely balanced and rather easy to drink. Makes a great session beer.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
1923,"2005-02-04",2.7,"1/2 Gallon Growler.  Apparently this beer will soon replace the Cutthroat Pale in 6 Packs, or something like that.  The brewery is trying to appeal to adventurous craft beer drinkers...with this beer...???....???....Right...........A clear amber beer w/ a frothy and wispy, almost cobwebby, head of white foam.  Aroma is surprisingly malt accented, showing hints of  caramel, dough and biscuit, while the hops are a bit peppery and spicy, but mostly grassy above all.  In the flavor, an appealing malt presence is present providing chewy fruit flavors and caramel, along with the hops, which show a bit of peppery spice and a touch of grass.  Not enough hop bitterness to balance the malty sweetness and above all, this is just very boring overall.  Its nerve-racking how simple, straight-forward and dull Odells beers have been lately.  Everytime I visit the brewery I suffer from rapid eye movement and then my body just goes into a sudden and immediate trance from beer boredom.  I wish they brewed more challenging styles.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
