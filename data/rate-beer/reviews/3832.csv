The aroma is very bright lemony lactic, citric and tart raspberries with some hints of acetic acid. The flavor is super fruity with cherries, tart raspberries, mild funk with wine-like oak and puckering acidity with a very lemony finish. Super drinkable and delicious. One tenth of a point off for a minor harshness on the way down, otherwise brilliant stuff.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

Flavor is soooo yogurty, tons of Cask 200 foundation with a tart layer of fruit. Its not a berry pie sugary sour - its a saison clearly. Raspberry again on top of the profile with some black cherry and honeydew perfume character. Really nice stuff.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
3832,"2015-02-13",4.2,"Tap at Sara. Pours cloudy pinkish peach, small white head, decent lacing. Aroma is lightly funky, fruity, berries, lemon, barnyard. Flavor is dry, fruity, light tart, light plus funk, mineral water, stems and skins. Medium body, soft carbonation. Very good.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3832,"2015-02-12",4.3,"Draft at SARA. Dang! Pours a hazy pinkish orange. Big time fruit and funk both on the nose and taste. Nicely tart and complex. First SARA beer and not a disappointment!","Valley Village, California, USA","Ontape"
