A beer that looks like a coke, very dark brown with almost no head and a fair amount of carbonation. The aroma is quite appealing and has some dark malt, pepper and noble hop elements to it.

1358,"2012-05-10",3.7,"16th march 2008: Drinking round the world today, had a Malt lager from Kenya and an Ale from the UK so far. So a Black Lager from Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) isnt a bad third choice.

Brown 500ml bottle, loads of life left, well 8 months anyway.

Poured into one of my Thistle shaped Gordon glasses (twice).

Cracking look to it, really deep black/ruby red colour with a fantastic creamy, full, biege head on top. The thistle glass really shows it off well.

More aroma than most black beers Ive had, there is some burnt malts and more than a little Porter and Stout type smells too.

Again the burnt malts are the dominant factor, this time with a lager style sharpness added.

At 5.2% it sits nicely, there is a slight heaviness in the mouthfeel, but it isnt a thick beer by any means.

1358,"2008-01-20",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 14, 2008 A voluminous mocha head crowns a deeply sanguine coloured body.  Lush chocolate swirls with toffee, sweetened coffee and cream; only the faintest of flowery hops.  Balance is found, combining supple malts and moderate bitterness ending dry with a hint of roast.  Creamy, yet slender, motivated by quick carbonation.

Absurdly drinkable with gobs of flavour.  Entrancing.

50cl bottle, best before 19 February 2009.

Dark brown hue with rusty highlights and a frothy, mocha head.  Beautifully straightforward aroma of dark cocoa powder and oily, black coffee.  Underneath, dates and heavily caramelized, almost burnt, sugar.  Light note of grass is faintly detectable.  Flavour starts with elements of roasted coffee and dark, dry chocolate.  Resting in the mouth, a smoky sliver emerges.  The finish is bitter on three fronts, presenting a dark roast, tingling grass and softly fruity white pepper.  A thin stream of heavily caramelized sugar runs through the middle of it all.  Vanilla, ever so delicate in presence, accents the other elements.  Roughly medium-bodied with a very silky texture and plentiful yet gentle carbonation.  Nothing flashy here -- only simple, incredibly clean, delicious fun.

1358,"2006-01-25",4.5,"Czechs for centuries, have brewed dark lagers, the most famous coming from a 15th Century brewpub in Prague called U-Fleku. Herold Bohemian Black Lager comes out of that Czech dark lager traditon, and is a delicious, smooth, complex dark lager, very similar to German schwarzbier or ""black beer"". 

This beer is brewed with four different malts including pilsner, crystal, Munich, and black patent. It employs the decoction method of brewing, in which a portion of the mash is removed from the mash tun, heated to a higher temperature, and then returned to the mash. This step in the brewing process gives a beer deep, toasty, and nutty malt character. Herold Bohemian Black is an exceptionally smooth beer, being lagered from 75 to 80 days. This beer is hopped three times with one variety, the famous Bohemian Red, or Saaz hop. 

Herold Bohemian Black Lager pours to a deep brown/black color with a thick and creamy white head, and a soft carbonation. The nose on this beer is very complex with aromas of sweet malt, nuts, dark chocolate, a hint of roast, a touch of smoke, and grassy hop aromas. The palate is equally complex with a slick and clean mouth feel. Flavors of dark chocolate, sweet malt, nuts, toast, with slight hints of roast and smoke that coat the tongue. This beer is very smooth and drinkable, and weighs in at 5.2% abv. Bohemian Black finishes with more complex dark malt flavors up front, and ends with a slighty grassy/cedary hop bitterness, that balances this beer to perfection. 

This is an outstanding dark lager with tremendous flavor and character. The label states this beer is a schwarzbier, and indeed it is. However, it is a little different from German examples. Herold Bohemian Black is a bit richer and fuller on the palate than its German counterparts, and a bit more hoppy in aroma and bitterness. This beer would work well with a number of hearty dishes. I would match this with German fare, Barbecued or grilled meats, even Japanese cuisine. Herold Bohemian Black is available in 1/2 liter bottles, and retails for $1.98 a bottle, making it well worth seeking out. A beer of this quality, at that price, is a steal.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

Medium full mouthfeel with a richness and smoothness that surprises. The flavor is not as sweet as one might expect, but its certainly not bitter. Nice balance of burnt caramel, faint smoke, and roasted malts. A very slight bitterness at the end is more due to the dark roasted malts than hops I suspect. Actually, the complexity surprised me. Quite enjoyable and easy to drink. A good beer to introduce to people who claim that they dont like ""dark beer.""","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"
1358,"2006-01-06",3.6,"(500 ml bottle: Obtained in trade with whaleman, thanks David!) This shows a bit more complexity than the dark, black lagers Ive tried so far.  Like many of the others, theres the sweet and roasty maltiness, the fine smokiness in the midpalate and finish, the moderate molasses and brown sugar, and light bitterness with a bit of hops in the finish, but Im also getting a fair amount of earth and wood, plus some maple and even a hint of cherry too.  Lots of brown sugar and molasses in the nose, but less roast and smoke than in the flavor.  The body comes across as a bit thin to me, but the real problem is the carbonation levels are fairly low.  Accordingly, the light tan head is very small and filmy on the pour and fully dissipates within a few minutes.  The body is very dark brown with ruddy highlights on the edges.  It seems to have good clarity, but its dark enough that I still cant really see through the beer.  In the end, the beer is quite sweet and shows a lot of sugary sweetness to boot, but despite this, the added complexity is a pleasant surprise and the overall impression is a very positive one.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

As I drank the beer, it slowly grew on me.  The molasses became more welcoming, the taste of raw malt subsided, and the saaz ended up giving an almost fruity herbal quality in the very end.  Once I got past my surprise and wrapped myself around this beer, I was quite pleased.  Some could really love this beer.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

1358,"2004-12-01",4.0,"Bottle.  Very lovely colored dark black with some deep crimson mixed with mahogany tones.  Garnet highlights on the edges.  Moderate light tan head, rapidly disipating.  Decent lacing.  Aroma of large amounts of hops, good caramel, black pepper, dark earthy/rootiness.  Hints of vanilla extract mixed with toffee.  Flavor opens up with a wonderful full chewy caramel flavor that is well-integrated with the hops providing wonderful balance.  Medium body that is much more flavorful than it is filling.  Light roast notes, some black licorice and a smooth velvety dark chocolate round it out with a great dose of bitterness and hops apparency on the end.  Superb stuff.  A number of times after sipping, the finish was strangely sour/bitter and lightly alcoholic, some odd off flavors at any rate.  But as it warmed, this diminished and I couldnt really pinpoint it.  Still, it is a bit bitter on the end and very hoppy for a schwarzbier.  But wonderfully flavorful nonetheless.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Chocolate, brown sugar, roasted malt, yeast, maple syrup, the slightest of hops, plum, molasses, liquorice,  and damp cellar round out the aroma.  Taste focuses initially more on the molasses, brown sugar, roasted malt, with a nice little hop bitterness that hits about the same time you feel the carbonation.  From there youre into some darker malt notes, coffee, yeast, and some earthy notes.  Finishes with notes of earth, yeast, floral hops, and a good metal-like taste.  Very nice beer.
