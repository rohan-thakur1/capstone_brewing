448,"2017-06-08",3.9,"I really enjoyed the very dark black colour of this beer. The intentsive coffee taste makes the beer too bitter for me - almost like real coffee (I am not going to repeat rest of the usual description of taste that comes with this kind of imperial stouts. It is already done very well by others).

Considering that I prefer more sweet-like imperial stouts, it is not my very favourite imperial stout. Of course, it is not bad - specially if one enjoys the bitter coffe taste - and I would recommend it to everyone, who enjoys really good stout, but for me, this beer lacks spirit - just thick coffee tasted imp stout isnt it.

448,"2017-04-07",4.0,"330 ml bottle bought at IC Beer in Kwun Tong.
Looks: Opaque deep blackish brown colour with a faint trace of yeast sediments; Near zero head with residual soapy beige foam which fades in 10 seconds; Poor sticky lacing with zero carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant dark malt, with strong roastyness, strong blackcurrant, raisins, plums, strong caramel, sticky toffee, dark chocolates, coffee, rich cream, floral, sugar, spices, liquorices, bread, light lemon and grass. Layered and nice!

Taste: Close to medium sweet rich dark malt, with very strong roastyness, very strong tartness, strong burnt toast, strong ash, light caramel, toffee, Cola, light raisins, muted dark fruits, strong black coffee, strong dark chocolates, floral, sugar, strong spices, strong earth, biscuits, light yeast, strong lemon, strong bitter hops and sharp grass. Wow!

Body: Medium body; Oily and smooth palate.

Mouth Feel: Rich dark maltyness in a thick background. Viscous yet slightly watery. Very roasty from the get go with big tartness Ive ever tasted for the style, intricately linked with dynamic black coffee and burnt toast, which work so damn well I though this is a freshly grinded iced black coffee! Some decent dark fruit background, ashy with bitter dark chocolate with matching floral and medium sweetness. Spicy biscuity with strong lemon to round. Big and nice!

Hoppiness: Floral, spices, light lemon and grass in nose, Strong spices, earth, floral, strong lemon and sharp grass in taste; Bitterness - hops and burnt malt - is very strong for a lasting, very high astringent bitter-sweet dark malty finish.

After taste: Quite dry. Tart, roasty and strong bitter to mouth.

Comments: Its aroma is nice and delicate with dark berries and cream, but nothing prepares me for the whirlwind of hard hitting taste - burnt toast, ashy tartness, dark fruits, strong black coffee and lemony hops. This is Guinness FES with a strong punch. Complex and mind blasting, highly recommended!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

448,"2017-01-28",4.5,"Aroma:

Medium/heavy aroma of malts, caramel, dark fruit, chocolate, molasses, mocha, roasted malts, coffee and hops.

Appearance:

Opaque black beer with a dark brown head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts, caramel, dark fruit, chocolate, molasses and mocha; ends slightly bitter and dry with roasted malts, coffee and hops.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. This is by far the most complete stout there is. It has everything; malts, caramel, chocolate, roasted malts, coffee; and even hops. All the flaws I can think of have to do with the abv. Ohh to even think about writing them down. It could have been intenser and with more intensity, complexity and balance matter even more. Strange to imagine this is the highest rating I can give for this style and even stranger to imagine that there might be something better out there.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Piana : Czapowata, bardzo trwała i gęsta w kolorze écru. Formuje średnie i drobne oczka. Perfekcyjnie krążkuje. Do ostatniego łyka pozostawia ślady. 
Zapach : Po otworzeniu butelki nawet nie musiałem przykładać jej do nosa żeby poczuć potężny aromat kawy. Rozprzestrzenił się on po całym pokoju. Tony ziarenek kawy , gorzka czekolada, słodkie toffi , crème brulée. W kolejnych niuchach lekko dymiony i wędzony charakter.
Płatki owsiane oraz karmel. 
Smak : Poteżna dawka kawy ! 
Następnie słodkie klimaty : karmel, toffi, crem brulee, cukierki coś w klimacie polskich kukułek, ciasto typu Brownie.
Pojawiają się również sugestie ciemnych owoców.
Goryczka jest jak dynamit, który czujesz że zaraz wybuchnie. Jest długa, bardzo wyraźna , kompletnie nie zalega. Finisz ma chmielowo-kawowy charakter. Alkohol kompletnie niewyczuwalny.
Eksplozja smaku! 
 Wysycenie : Niskie - idealne! 
Podsumowanie: 

To na bank najlepszy stout owsiany jaki piłem i jeden z lepszych stautów w kontekście ogólnym.
Mikkeller to kultowy duński browar . Niektóre warki tego stouta warzone były w norweskim Nogne Ø. 
Perfekcyjny balans pomiędzy podstawą słodową, a goryczką. To piwo ma to co powinno znajdować się w doskonałym stoucie. Wszystko idealnie się komponuje. Pije się go nadwyraz przyjemnie, a odczucie w ustach jest pełne i aksamitne. 
Kilka procentów więcej i mógłby być również bardzo dobrym RIS-em. Przypomina niektóre imperialne stouty z De Molen i Emelisse i kompletnie od nich nie odstaje, a nawet w niektórych walorach je przewyższa.

A very nice coffee and oatmeal stout, but not quite as smooth as the Brunch Weasel. Theres a little bitterness in the finish that I found completely absent in the Brunch Weasel, and fact is, on a dollar-per-ABV basis, the price is about the same.

Samo piwo ciemno brazowe, przy nalewaniu zachowuje sie jakby bylo geste. Aromaty rzeczjasna kawowe, ale poza kawa czuc tez palonosc (wcale niemala), zbozowosc, troche nut zywicznych, troszke gorzkiej czekolady, jakies nuty ziemiste - o dziwo ta kompozycja wychodzi dosc rzeska. W smaku niemal to samo, w tej samej kolejnosci i moze nawet jeszcze fajniej sie komponuje. Jest lekko kwaskowate od slodow palonych pewnie, jest bardziej w strone wytrawna choc wcale nie jakos ekstremalnie, kawa na jezyku bardziej mi sie kojarzy z robusta niz z arabica.

The palate is thick, very smooth, somewhat foamy with very light carbonation. The first impression shows a lot of black coffee forwardness with a slight tartness akin to most coffee.

Flavor

As with the aroma the coffee is very intense and numbs the other flavors. Im picking up hints of chocolate, roasted malts and vanilla. There is also a noticeable grassy hoppy flavor present. Even if the coffee flavor is quite intense it does not ruin the beer at all. It works really well!

The carbonation level is higher which makes the mouth feel of the beer less smooth. Personally I would prefer lesser carbonation.

448,"2014-11-11",4.3,"(330ml bottle @ Pitchers, Linköping, Nov 11 2014) Pours black with basically no head. Great nose of dark malts, toasted or lightly burnt wood (not ashy), medium/dark roast coffee, some dark chocolate with hints of sweetness, soy is light but detectable. On the palate, cold pressed coffee, a little raw cane sugar sweetness at first, quickly fades. Some dry dark chocolate joins the coffee in the middle, a bit of dark malt character. Roast quite present from both coffee and malt, but it is not overpoweringly burnt, just nice and dry. Oat character helps support that dryness from the middle on. Lightly woody, but not in the barrel sense. Medium-full slick body with light prickly carb. Long finish of coffee and roast, dry with no booze.

El amargor es de intensidad y persistencia media, no solo por el lúpulo si no también por el tostado de la malta y el alto grado alcohólico aunque este último está muy bien camuflado y apenas es perceptible.

Strong roasted coffee flavor making it quite bitter; along with roasted oats, finishes dry and bitter. This is what Im ideally looking for in an Oatmeal Stout.

Roasted and burnt malts on the nose, with notes of cream, chocolate, citrus, pine resin and a subtle hint of coffee. Malts taste more burnt than on the nose, an impart a large degree of bitterness. Other than that, taste of coffee, nuts, a slightly earthen note and a fair amount of hops, imparting sour notes predominantly. Chocolate isnt quite as noticeable as Id have liked.

448,"2014-05-28",3.3,"The aroma is very complex; I was ready for that. It takes a few sniffs to get everything that is going on. Smells of oak, bourbon, light raisin, fig. Not as strong of a coffee aroma as one would expect. Dark chocolate undertones in the scent. Expensive dark chocolate, not artificial like in some beers. Some booze, not much. Black in color with a medium tan head. Leaves heavy lacing on the glass. Great looking stout. Taste is pleasant coffee, not overpowering. Hop bitterness comes through after the coffee. Flavor is not nearly as complex as the aroma. Surprisingly watery in texture - I was really expecting a richer palate. I can see why they say it goes well with breakfast. A stronger beer would be too much for the morning. Being that I never drink beer for breakfast, I really have no use for this. The palate is disappointing, its very expensive and the flavor doesnt give you much besides coffee and hops. Its not bad, but no way should it be 100 points. Perhaps I am biased because I like big, bold, rich stouts, and this is not one of those. For the price and reputation, I was expecting to be blown away.

OCZY : piwo jest ciemniejsze od smoły. Ma średniej wielkości piane o kolorze brązowym.

NOS : piwo ma mocne nuty palone podobne do świeżo palonej kawy, przypalonego tosta, dymu, słodkich płatków kukurydzianych. Pomimo dominujących nut podpalanych piwo ma również wyraźne aromaty chmielowe podobne do skórki cytryny. 

USTA : mało gazowane o silnym nasyceniu. Konsystencja podobna do tłustego mleka. 
Piwo jest dosyć słodkie jak czarna czekolada. Mocne nuty przypalane i dymione nadają piwu cierpkość ale nie do przesady. Piwo jest również gorzkie przy końcu bardziej jak kakao niż kawa bo nawet na końcu cierpkość jest świetnie pokryta głębokimi nutami oleistej czekolady i cukru. 

ODCZUCIA : mocne nuty kawowe i czekoladowe są świetnie wyeksponowane ale w przeciwieństwie wielu kawowych stoutów, cierpkość jest umiarkowana. Dzięki temu piwo łatwo się pije i pewnie świetnie smakuje po leżakowaniu w beczkach dębowych.

Strong aromatic smell of coffee, espresso, a little aggressive but wrapped up well in roasted malt sweetness with hazelnut.

Coffee is defining my first impression of tasting this beer. I find it very interesting, that the coffee flavor is troughout evolving and changing on my palate from the beginning to the end, which gives the beer a decent complexity with a medium-body. Coffee goes very well along with chocolate, perfect mingling together, to one creamy opening, which developes more bitter and malty to the end. The aftertaste is enormous, lasts for minutes and even longer as the beer warms up. Carbonation is higher than expected, but supports this style of stout easily, not too present giving this a fresher note. Coffee flavor is really great in this beer, sugar and malts are in perfect balance and support it, without making the beer too sweet or distract from the coffee, the main attraction. The development through different stages on the palate without loosing focus on the coffee impresses me, and it stays for such long time. Even the late uprising bitterness seems to go along with a remarcable smoothness, which gives this beer a soft, oily, appreciable mouthfeel. Chocolate becomes very present at the end and adds a yummy sweet note to the overall bitterness. This beer tastes great!","GERMANY","aleigator"

Extremely enticing, barely can withstand not drinking it. First taste brings dark chocolate and toasty oats. Reminds me of slightly burnt oatmeal and scorched brown sugar.

448,"2013-10-23",4.3,"FROM NOTES: June 29, 12
Served in cellar temerature from a 22 ounce bottle into brandy snifter. 

A: Espresso, roasted malt, dark chocolate notes and a little bit of yeast and alcohol. 
A: Pours pitch black with a big creamy, foamy light-brown head. 
T: Strong roasted malt with notes of chocolate. Strong coffee taste but blended well with other tastes. This goes down dangerously well. Very robust flavors. 
P: Thick and full bodied, yet so smooth. Velvety smooth and absolute delight! 
O: This is the best coffee stout Ive had in a very long time, maybe ever. While it is, in fact, an imperial oatmeal stout, the intricate mix of malts lends itself to an excellent mouth-feel and velvety smooth taste.

448,"2013-09-22",3.5,"Bottle from Cave a Bulles in Paris. Bottled in February 2012.

Aroma: Initial classic porter roastiness (freshly baked brown bread and roasted coriander) gives the stage to a strong, yet pleasant alcohol presence. True to the info provided by the guys in the shop, coffee aroma is very subdued and barely audible. 

Taste: Much less sweet than expected. Alcohol, so prominent in the aroma, is nowhere to be found. Coffee note, on the other hand, is quite accented, but doesnt overpower the mouth feel and contributes well to the overall roasty profile. 
In addition, here we are dealing with a strong, black and well-roasted coffee.Flaws? Well, the body feels a bit thin, wouldve loved it to be a thicker and chewier brew.

A very good brew, the least complex and, for the lack of better word, the most laid back of the Mikkeller RIS offerings I had thus far. And this is a good thing, if you ask me.

Taste: Very well orchestrated blend of coffee, chocolate, dark malts. No single component stands out other than the coffee, which is not overly dominant

Palate: Extremely smooth mouthfeel. Minimal carbonation. Mouth coating goodness

Overall: Excellent coffee stout. WnB is comparable, but this seems to end up more integrated, and with no acidity.","Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, USA","icehawk"

Walked on down after work. Full nonic pint of this bad-boy. A nice finger width creamy beige head on top. Excellent retention. Leaves perfect sip rings clinging to the glass, reminding me of what was. Nice potent chocolate aroma, melds well with coffee grounds, vanilla extract, and a slight earthy scent. I can tell this one is going to be rich. 

Creamy body. This is similar to a nitro-draft. Really mellow smooth mouthfeel. Good viscosity. Coffee flavors abound and really start this one off. I can see where the ""Breakfast"" comes from. This characteristic doesnt overpower though, as it fades into a milk chocolate sweetness with touches of vanilla and almond. Slight roasted aftertaste gives it a subtle smoky taste that I dig. 

This is a really well-made beer, and I can totally see how it gets the marks that it does. I never felt like pulling the trigger on the slightly expensive bottle whenever I see it, but Im glad I got it now.","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"

Undated eurodeuce.  Based on aroma, this bottle isnt fresh, but certainly not past its prime.   

Spectacular flavor.  One of the smoothest flavors in an oatmeal stout Ive ever had.  Coffee adds to the very dry bitterness, but provides no overwhelming coffee flavors.  (Presumably the product of coffee notes fading as the bottle has aged.)

Summarily, the mouthfeel provides a dry, flat bitterness that maintains gently but consistently. 

Overall, a standard of beer.  A standard of oatmeal stouts foremost, in my opinion, but also of beers with coffee in the bill.  The balance of this beer is unsurpassed within the style.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","gonzosauce"

Black with a large, three centimetre tall head that is part bubbly/part creamy looking and seems quite thick on first appearance. The colour of the head is a tan brown colour and the retention is okay with only a slight reduction.

Roasted malts, some cocoa and a nice helping of coffee. There is a lingering smokey aroma that I hadnt been expecting and some dark chocolate too.

Smooth with a medium to full body and stronger than expected carbonation although nothing to lively. The beer had quite a rich and creamy feel to it and it went down well with a nice, boozy alcohol finish.

448,"2012-11-08",4.2,"Bottle, traded with Cunningham. Lovely looks - like Irish coffee, black with a dense, creamy head. Lovely nose - a good dose of coffee intertwined with a rich dark maltiness, with notes of dusty, dark chocolate, and also dusty roasted grain, plus more subtle notes of licorice, wood and tobacco. Rich and deep aroma, while the coffee is not dominating. The mouthfeel is nothing short of excellent, almost more creamy than cream itself. Robust, thick body, smooth and oily palate. The taste is equally deep as the aroma, bitter with a somewhat dryish finish. Tons of dark maltiness - roasty and chocolatey - in the flavour. The coffee notes stand out in the aftertaste that carries with it the aroma of roast, wood and earth, plus more subtle hints of piney hops. What I miss here is at least some small hint of balancing sweetness that would draw this beer even closer to perfection.","Mikołów, POLAND","ElDesmadre"

Finish is a dry bitter.This is the second time I had the Beer Geek Breakfast. Again I am thinking, perhaps the #1 Ratebeer Stout ranking for this one affects my judgment. Overall, a complex enjoyable beer. A bit challenging for me, as it is on the dry and bitter side of stouts, as opposed to sweeter and/or hoppier imperial stouts I usually enjoy.

Aftertaste is roasted and mildly bitter. To be honest, the flavor was a bit of a letdown after the aroma. Its definitely not bad, but disappointing nonetheless.

Mouthfeel: Light-to-medium-bodied with a surprisingly high amount of prickly carbonation. Its a bit watered down compared to what I want in an Imperial Stout.

Drinkability: Good drinkability. The alcohol is well masked so you could easily finish a pint or two without much difficulty.

Overall: Pretty good beer overall. The flavor leaves a little to be desired and the mouthfeel is subpar. The aroma and appearance are right where you want them. While it doesnt compare well with many of the higher rated Imperial stouts or coffee stouts on the market, Id still say this one is worth trying.","Fort Myers, Florida, USA","adam42381"

Very rough and piercing, charred and burnt grains, and heavily roasted coffee beans on the nose with a considerably tainting note of paint stripper reaching through. There is just  the slightest nuances of vanilla-choc icecream, peppery hops and dark chocolate. Woody, tannic, puckering, harsh and bitter burnt malt and heavily roasted coffee bean flavours grip the palate. I could stop writing, as that is it. One dimensional and shed a tear sad!

448,"2012-02-21",4.9,"12oz bottle shared with the friends. Let me start be saying this this beer is  brewed with Civet Coffee, which as we all know, is coffee that is pooped out of a cat-weasel thing. Luckily, my buddy MADE me try it, as I couldnt get over the poop-in-my-beer aspect up to that point. And It was great! Complex, rich, huge nose. Coffee notes with hints of cocoa, butterscotch, and whiskey barrels. Taste follows the nose with a big creamy texture, coffee and smoke, cocoa and booze. I definitely realized instantly that I was drinking something special. Amazingly contemplative beer. We must have talked about it for 45min. Only reason I didnt give it a 5 was because it was brewed with poop.","Massachusetts, USA","Ilovehead"

Aroma emits a resinous dark chocolate and black coffee presence reminiscent of a nice french roast coffee. Roasty. Hints of smokiness waft up from the glass as well. Finally the first sip makes its way to my lips. At first I find a bitter cup of black coffee with a side of super dark chocolate. The bitterness slowly fades to a drying, less bitter espresso taste. Notes of toasted bread come through with a hints of somewhat burnt edges. Full and chewy body with just the right amount of coffee and chocolate aftertaste. I could drink/contemplate this beer all day. Fantastic!","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"

Now for some reason I thought I was going to be blasted with coffee in the nose but I didnt not that I was disappointed by that I didnt but I would of figured since it was called Beer Geek Breakfast that more coffee would be in there.  Usually my kind of breakfast is a nice latte from Starbucks =)  Instead I think the star of the aroma is another breakfast treat. Oats.  Nice oatmeal like aroma.  Backed up by espresso, roasted malt, and a tiny bit of a grassy hop aroma.

Taste is basically the same but things seem a bit more balanced.  The coffee and roasted malt notes I got from the smell definitely match up nice with the oats.  Its more 50/50.  The taste is slightly bitter from the coffee and slightly dry from the hops.

448,"2012-01-06",4.1,"Bottle from El Irlandés. Batch #582. This one appears in the glass with an impenetrable black color with a big rocky brown head that diminishes very slowly and laces well. Aroma is malty, deep, showing especially toasted coffee grains, bitter chocolate, oat, truffles and vanilla. Solid and elegant but as it warms you start getting slight hoppy notes of lemongrass that counterbalance in a heavenly way. Taste is roasted but finely supported by the malty sweetness. Generous strong coffee notes dominate everything else and persist even several minutes after the last sip. Under that there is a second layer with hints of chocolate, caramel malt, cereal, vanilla and a very soft trace of hop bitterness. I perceive this as a classic, prototypical oatmeal stout but with added complexity of hops. This stout showcases an oily texture, low carbonation and a tremendously smooth full body. In the end, a long and fine roasted finish leaves an intense aftertaste. A breakfast beer but you could still pair it with oysters, bacon and smoked ham. A perfectly made Danish stout that I would love to have for breakfast every day.","Hanga Roa, Easter Island, CHILE","Panzerfaust"

No lacing, but a nice cohesive head.  Aroma is big of darkly roasted malts, some chocolate and coffee/espresso along with some smaller amounts of dark fruits and just a hint of alcohol bite.  Flavor is also strong of the dark malts, chocolate malts and a fairly intense amount of hop bitterness.  Better than average palate, but not quite what I expected from the oatmeal.

448,"2011-09-09",4.0,"I poured a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass.Appearance: Pitch black body without any traces of red. A very dark, brown, whipped cream-like head which retains and laces extremely well.Smell: Light dairy-aisle aroma with minor notes of iced coffee. The nose is surprisingly tame, although it indicates it will be more sweet than bitter.Taste: Beer Geek Breakfast is one of those beers that starts off with a bang, but then seems to fall victim to the law of diminishing returns. The first few sips are incredible, actually. Strong flavors of a robust, imperial oatmeal stout. A light sweetness throughout the first half, very cream-like. Then suddenly the roasted malts appear out of nowhere for a big, bitter taste. Bitter dark chocolate also emerges between the two flavors and again as the roasty flavor transitions to a light iced coffee sweetness. This is a very impressive and tasty palate.As I drink on, the laws of entropy affect the palate. The sweetness mellows out, and the coffee bitterness fades a little. It certainly remains a quality oatmeal stout through and through, but the overall palate seems better when its not homogenized. I was also a little disappointed by the lack of real coffee flavor per se, although the coffee bitterness is plenty prominent. Mouthfeel: Soft, comfortable, and less thick than youd expect.Drinkability: This beer psyches you out. It looks, smells, and tastes a little like an imperial stout, but its not since its only 7.5% ABV. Its surprising just how easy it is to gulp down and just how velvety smooth the texture is. This is a good beer to have as a liquid dessert.Overall, Mikkeller Beer Geek Breakfast is a perfect example of a higher end oatmeal stout, although I dont think it justifies its higher end price point of $13 a bottle.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Active carbonation visible from the sides of the glass. Roasty, oat, chocolate, complex coffee aroma. Great coffee aftertaste that lasts and lasts. Great bitterness, with some sweet permeating all throughout. Wonderful full body and texture. The carbonation is stronger than I was expecting. A delicious and effective brew. Fantastic to enjoy outside in my backyard with my cat on this beautiful morning (Im supposed to drink this in the morning, right?). Quite large chunks at the very bottom of the glass.

Up front, I can quickly tell that I definitely dont like it as much as I recall liking the Nogne O version. Bit more metallic, kind of toasty and spicy, more of an astringent sort of coffee flavor. Moderate bitter taste, light to mdoerate sweet. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, kind of crisp light carbonation. Very dark brown color, near-black. Slightly translucent around the edges. Thin bubbly tan head, leaving decent bits of lace. A solid euro stout, but nowhere near as good as I remember. Cant tell if thats my frame of reference expanding, or the quality of the beer dropping. Probably the former. 7/3/4/7/15 UPDATE 6/21/15: This has been growing on me more and more as I return to the taps to take more sips.

448,"2011-06-11",4.1,"I have described other beers as ""black"", but this one is beyond black. This is like a black hole, without any Hawking radiation. Ok, thats not quite true: when held up against a 300 W light bulb its possible to discern a infinitesimally thin region close to the glass where the liquid is dark grey. When pouring the beer it seems very viscous, and out of this black lava a big, dense, creamy, brown head slowly emerges, its almost a bit creepy to watch. The only thing that isnt absolutely perfect with the look of this beer is that the head gets rather small fairly quickly, and it doesnt create huge amounts of lacing. Smelling the beer reveals a delicious malty aroma with lots of roasted notes, chocolate and strong coffee. A promising hoppy scent is lurking in the background. The taste is initially light to medium sweet and light bitter followed by a moderate bitter finish and a very long bitter and roasted aftertaste. The flavours are roasted with chocolate, coffee, raisins, some alcohol and also some very nice hints of pine and grapefruit. Full body, oily texture, soft+ carbonation. A fantastic beer!

Poured into a snifter. The color is a deep, dark brown with a short light mocha head and a kiss of lacing on the side of the glass. Im watching college basketball, so I think that reference is only appropriate.

The nose is really nice with a strong odor of fresh-roasted coffee along with a bit of roasted malt. While the latter is there, the coffee is definitely on the center stage and is quite tasty. A bit one dimensional and I could use more depth, but the coffee definitely gets this up to a 4.0. Nice slightly bitter and roasted feel. A really nice coffee brew.

Aroma is chocolate, earthy coffee, and a definite hoppy, citrusy aroma. Must be from the Cascade hops, because it smells like a double IPA. Flavor is much of the same: chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, and a slight citrusy hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, which is to be expected from an oatmeal stout.

It pours a tick, dark black. The head is tick, large and tan. It isnt as impressive as other Beer Geek Variations but it does work. Thick lacing rims the walls of the glass as the fluffy head slowly recedes.

The smell is roasty, a huge coffee note dominates. More sniffing introduces toffee, caramel, and chocolate.

The flavor is thick and roasty. Tons of roasted malt and coffee are in the flavor. There is surprisingly little malt to compete with the bitterness. There is a light bit of tartness and chocolate. It isnt as good as the variations that came out of it, but it is solid.

The smell is very appealing to a beer and coffee lover. You definitely smell some coffee but the dominating aroma is roasted malt. Other notes are of dark chocolate and perhaps a hint of licorice. This beer has been named appropriately.

First sip immediately reveals that the flavor profile of this brew is complex. Initially tastes of bitter dark chocolate which progresses to roasted malts and finishes with a definitive coffee aftertaste. I find that as this beer warms slightly the flavors really shine. I favor the coffee which comes out deliciously once the beer has sat a few minutes.

The beer is smooth and somewhat thick in the mouth with medium carbonation.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","gramity"

S- Smell is very good. RIS-like with coffee stout qualities as well. Roasted malt is the the main character with a big background of dark bittersweet chocolate, anise, and licorice.

T- Flavor is complex and gets much better as it warms. Upfront is bitter dark chocolate and a hint of licorice but with a really big roasted malt background. The finish is mostly roasted malt with a hint of the initial flavors lingering in there. A moderate roasted malt bitterness lingers with a hint of dark chocolate wrapped in a warm alcohol blanket. 

M- Medium to high carbonation and a moderately thick and smooth body.

D- At first this brew just comes off as all coffee and roasted malt-but it really shines as it warms. One of the better coffee stouts out there as well as one of the originals-Happy to finally try this brew!

Aroma: The nose is roasty with a bit of chocolate liqueur, a bit of flint, earth, and herbal hops. This brew smells outstanding. 
Appearance: It pours an almost pitch black with the slightest of ruby highlights and a large, dense, creamy, tan head.  To say this brew has head retention is an understatement.  The head lasts forever. 
Taste: Rich and roasty.  There is a deep bitterness from both the hops and the roasting.  There is a touch of underlying sweetness that brings dark caramel into play.  The coffee really comes through as well.  As the beer warms, a touch of raisin, soy, and smoke emerges. 
Palate: Very rich with a surprising amount of prickly carbonation leading to a very dry, burnt and bitter finish. 
Overall: If didnt know better, I would say this is an imperial stout.  This was a complex brew for sure, but the finish came across as a bit raw to me.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

Good thing I wasnt here yesterday as I noticed that site cancer hoser was here spoiling the air of the venue with his poisonous presence. Ok - I gotta do a full 360 on my original rating - even though I pointed out that I need to rate again. This.  Is.  Awesome.  Ultra thick creamy oatmeal and chocolate is amazing. The faint fruit and coffee background is just a bonus in the smelly treat. The taste is stellar with a moderate yet stiff coffee that gives way on all fronts to bitter super dark milky chocolate - jay imagine using half the container of brown cow and then filling the last third of the glass with milk and then stirring the fuck out of it. Not saying it tastes like that but it just has that much more choco goodness. Stellar oatmeal. Thickest dark choco imaginable. The bite is a mix of bitterness and a mild spice (sort of), light candy fruit, dryness on the finish - dry roasty grain. Super thick and smooth. It does taste better if I dont put too much thought into it. The finish isnt the greatest but the early impressions are. Oh - and plenty of time between sips makes a huge difference as I find that this shot reeks havoc on my palate. Balls. Updated from 7473 14:3.5


Black. Chocolatey brown cap with great retention and better than average lacing. Big coffee aroma with chocolate that cowers behind the wake of coffee destruction. Some sort of hops, lemon, smells pretty good but nothing amazing. The coffee is quite nice. Not a lot of complexity. Taste: bitterness, tartness, then coffee and chocolate - more chocolate than in the aroma, burnt malts and not much more. Drying and bitter - kind of boring. Maybe Ill think differently after another bottle is cracked.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

448,"2010-09-19",3.6,"[500ml bottle from Jim - cheers!] Black as you like, with the darkest brown head Ive ever seen on a beer - although oddly it noticeably lightened as I drank it.  Visibly thick, viscous and oily as you pour it.  Dominated by roasted malts that have one foot into the ""burnt"" camp.  Theres some liquorice in there and a bit of marmite.  The coffee is in there, but disappointingly subtle.  Very smooth in the mouth (mouthfeel of milk chocolate, although not the taste), but also a little too sticky at times.  The burnt/roasted malt is still by far the biggest taste at the end (still maybe a little too harsh and burnt), and strangely, and unusually for me, I felt it desperately needed a huge hit of lemony hops or something (maybe more coffee?) to make it less one-dimensional.  Its certainly not unpleasant, but I felt it fell far short of its reputation.","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","wheresthepath"

448,"2010-07-23",4.0,"Pours out a motor oil black with only the very most edge showing a dark walnut brown.  The head is thick and creamy.  When it lowers it leaves behind a tan lacing, which lasts for most of the drink.  The nose is all bitter coffee and earthy hops, chocolate, liquorice and a cola or cherry like presence.  There is also a wooded or dusty vanilla quality reminiscent of a barrel aged beer - this is impressive.  As it warms the flavours open up.  I can find that particular Mikkeller soy sauce note in this - which is so present in Black and Black Hole.  And now the hops tune up to become astringent.  One would be forgiven for thinking this had a much higher ABV than its 7.5%, not due to any heat but because the flavours are so dominating.  The finish is bitter and tapering with just a little malt sweetness creeping in.  A well made and enjoyable stout.  I popped the cap at 10.12AM.

A light medium body of the beer really surprised me and is the only reason why it is not rated higher, but the Beer Geek Breakfast Stout makes up for its lacking depth by offering a wide range of flavors to the palate.

Coffee in the flavor, but then what? a weird void of dry nothingness, and then acidic chocolate. What just happened? Some numbing effect in the middle of the tongue that makes me think that this is supposed to be some high concept zen experience masquerading as a beer. Okay, if thats the point that I get it. I respect you, Mikkeler, for being so expressive of the existentialist dilemma we face when trying to reconcile a lifestyle that pursues luxury while remaining rooted in an essentially rustic peasant food.

First sip is dark chocolate, slight roasted bitter/sour, dark roasted coffee mid-palate and espresso around the sides.  Not nearly as overpowering as I thought it would be given the color and aroma.  Slight vegetal after taste that compliments the roasty, chocolate goodness up front.   This is an excellent coffee stout that keeps getting better with every sip!","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"
448,"2010-05-15",3.9,"From the bottle.  Pours a deep black with a few finger coffee colored head, that slowly recedes.  Smells of bitter coffee and toasty and roasty malts.  The taste is more of burnt coffee / popcorn than any other flavor.   A hit of booze sneaks through.  Great creamy mouthfeel.  Overall a good beer, but the coffee has just been roasted a little too long","New York, USA","TheMantle"
448,"2010-05-14",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2017 [5/10] 500ml bottle. Black. Thick , quivering dome of crema head. Quite a few tiny bubbles. Gentle, enticing mocha and roasted malt aroma with some vanilla, porridge and dark berries.Oily verging on creamy mouthfeel with quite German sweetness and a hint of metal before roast and coffee bitterness kick in and linger. The main flavours are good and well balanced. The complex notes mesh well with the main flavours - almost like harmonics. And the beer is not overwhelming: it retains a sense of space as if listening to music in a room rather than through headphones. [8 4 9 5 18 =4.4][12/12] Pours a little gloopily but ends up looking the same. As before, except the metallic tinge is absent and citrus flavours - which are just slightly intrusive - are more obvious. Super balance, fairly powerful but easily manages to be inviting. [4/17] Can. US product. Black, tan head laces well. Lots of oats, moderate roast, coffee doesnt have a lot of ""top"". Very porridgish. Bitterness is firm, but hop aromatics ont do a whole lot.

Nose is quite nice, well balanced between coffee and chocolate notes, and a stronger alcohol note than might be expected from a 7.5% beer.  Flavors are nice, though perhaps too dominated by the coffee.  Not quite so well balanced and delicious as the nose would indicate.  As the beer warms, the coffee is overtaken by roast flavors and the bitterness of the beer picks up a bit.  Overall, a very good brew.","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","WabashMan"

448,"2010-05-02",4.2,"Bottle.

A - Deep, dark black, even on the edges. Large, thick, creamy, sticky sandy brown head. Very good retention with a thick, creamy layer of lacing left.

S - Rich malt aroma with espresso beans being dominant, they smell perfectly roasted. Also present is a good amount of dark chocolate and toasted oats along with some caramel and a hint of vanilla. Somewhere in between a strong coffee stout aroma and a regular stout.

T - At first, there was more bitterness and roasted flavors than I picked up in the nose. Strong roasted coffee and malt along with a load of roasted oat flavors up front along with some dark chocolate. Mid sip, some earthy and slight citrus hop flavors come out. However, there is still a large roasted presence. After it warms up and opens up for a little while, the flavors mesh a bit more. The strong roasted bitterness blends and becomes a bit more mellow. Oat, coffee, and chocolate mix with some caramel, lactose, and hints of vanilla. Coffee is definitely prominent but not dominant.

M - Slightly above medium body with moderate carbonation. Smooth, creamy and rich mouthfeel.

D - Quite a drinkable beer, especially after it warms and opens up a bit. Quite smooth and balanced. The coffee flavor is definitely there and present, but it is as strong and dominant as other coffee forward beers.

Notes: Batch No. 412 (Brewed on 17/03/09). Nice breakfasty beer. Coffee and oats are there and upfront but not dominant. Coffee mixes roasted bitter and sweet lactose well and oats make a smooth, slightly chewy enjoyable beer. Really nice when it opens up and becomes a bit more smooth and balanced. Not the best beer Ive had, but a good solid beer.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

448,"2010-04-30",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2010 Update 2010-05-08: Doing a new tasting, this time batch #464, brewed 2009-10-26. Wow! Is it me, or the beer? This is a quite different experience! This one is a lot more easy/soft, with no stingy rubber madness! Nose is still mainly coffee and chocolate. Aroma is mainly of coffee, caramel, malt, with some tobacco and slightly fruity edges. Earthy undertones, hints of nuts. A long, pleasantly bitter finish. A very welcome surprise!

Batch #357, brewed 2008-04-24, tasted 2010-04-30.

It poured a black brew, blacker than an extra black black hole on a moonless night! Light just doesnt pass through it - even holding a lighter on one side of the glass didnt help. Head was half a cm, brown and disappeared quickly.

Smell: Very nice, somewhat fresh actually, dominated by chocolate malt and coffee. Pretty much what Id imagined.

Then theres the taste and aroma. Which was quite something else than Id expected! The first sips felt like eating a whole sea urchin dipped in liquid rubber (!) - and I thought ""what? is there something wrong with my bottle?"" - but then I paired it with some dark chocolate (great pairing), and read some reviews here to see if other people described a stingy, heavy bitterness - which many did. Which again leads me to believe its supposed to taste like this. Now, after some more sips and a little more chocolate to balance out my mouth, Im starting to enjoy it, though Im still uncertain about it. The bitterness is just a bit overwhelming for me. Apart from that, the aroma is mainly coffee and rubber. Yeah, rubber. Like eating bicycle tires and having a cup of coffee at the same time. Im having trouble with this one, to be honest.

Im liking the palate though, which is full and thick and creamy. Carbonation is to me quite spot on - not too much and not too little. The long finish is bitter.

If this beer was a movie it would be a well-made(-but-not-my-taste) film noir, called ""The long, bitter finish"". 

Its definitely a complex, impressive brew nonetheless, but perhaps not my style. Well, I still have two more bottles, so Im gonna give it another shot later. Maybe its actually good for breakfast? Bacon, eggs, good cheese and this beer sounds like an interesting experiment!","NORWAY","abstractbeer"

Poured a dead black ale in the tulip with a massive mocha colored meringue cap....lasts the drink and laces well. 

Aroma is pungent roast with coffee tones but there is a layered cereal complexity under this giving a grainy sweetness under some hop spice bouquet.

- rich rounded mouth feel big bodied. 

Big body and malts meet the palate in the profile front side, then almost instantly coffee-hop light astringenscy flood the palate, seconds later the oats show with some nutty flavor a bit of cereal complexity...like oatmeal and raisins with espresso poured over it.....finish is long and wet with puckering bittering from hops and coffee.

The body on this is quite thin, considering the complexity, but not surprising because of the oats.  I detect everything in that I got from the nose, but the sour cherries were a brief flash at the beginning before making the vanishing act.

448,"2010-03-03",4.3,"Location: 500 ml bottle from Norms, 3/3/10 


Aroma: Tons of coffee on the nose, some chocolate, vanilla, theres smokiness there too

Appearance: This beer pours an opaque brown-black color with a somewhat thin, creamy brown head that leaves some drippy lace on the glass

Flavor: The taste is lots of roasted and burnt malts, some creamy coffee/chocolate, and earthy hop bitterness gives a nice balance to the burnt toast malt flavors

Palate: Its not as full as expected, say medium bodied, with a nice mouthfeel, it has a nice, not overly heavy, drinkability/feel to it that works pretty well, its pretty smooth, creamy, chewy, and has soft to average carbonation

Overall Impression: 
This is a really good brew.  One of the better stouts Ive even had, it has a wonderful complexity to it.  Drinks so nicely, it is somehow not the full bodied brew I was expecting, but manages to be just full enough.  I can see why this one gets so much hype, Id been holding onto it for a while, but today is a good day, so Ill celebrate with this incredible beer.

It actually made my brain stop thinking for almost 10 seconds. I was just caught in the moment, in the beautiful full, chewy chocolate coffee mouthfeel.

S: A rather tame nose. Mild aromas of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate.

T: The primary flavor is the roasted malt. The coffee is not quite as intense as I expected, but certainly present. A nice bitterness on the finish.

M: A smooth, creamy, full bodied feel on the tongue. The carbonation is fairly low, and helps to contribute to this silky feel.

D: The booze is not really present at all, which is good for an imperial stout, but not surprising since its only 7.5%. Good flavors, if not a bit underwhelming.

448,"2010-01-03",4.7,"Im a beer geek and proud of it. Yes. Yes, I am. Mikkeller understands this. Why else would they have an exquisitely divine oatmeal coffee stout named, aptly so, Beer Geek Breakfast. I also find it a bit ironic that Ive had their Beer Geek Brunch with Weasel before I had their Beer Geek Breakfast, the stout that started it all.


Black, thick, rich, and viscous, she pours velveteen and black as pitch. Equally thick, rich and smooth is her head which is a gorgeous espresso crema, lingering long and soft from the first to last quaff. Stretching her fingers up the sides of my glass, her nose gently envelops me. Just as her appearance promised, thick, rich, and smooth. There is a subtle creaminess which permeates her nose which oozes rich European chocolates, oatmeal, and freshly drawn espresso. I have the oatmeal to thank for her smoothness and creaminess which I just know will be even more evident when I finally sup on her liquid bounty. But before I do, there is more of her nose to tease and tantalize. Black licorice, plums, raisins, burnt wood, and rich black earth culminates in burnt black chocolate, espresso crema, and toasted oats. Divine. I could smell her nose all day, but then I would be denying myself the beauteous brew below. Eyes closed, our lips meetand the heavens open unto me. A shiver courses from the tip of my toe to the top of my head, tracing ecstasy every single step of the way. Beervana is surely made of this, the rivers running black with Mikkeller Beer Geek Breakfast while soft cappuccino clouds float by upon a breeze of chocolate esters and dark fruits. I forgo any reservations I might have had and draw deep for each subsequent quaff. Her body is melted chocolates and cream with a sprinkling of vanilla bean and licorice root, leaving nary a surface of my mouth untouched. The finish dries, lingering long with brittle chocolates, charred wood, burnt sugars, and a touch more espresso crema. Dried raisins and prunes decorate the middle of her palate and, as her body warms, the oats are toasted to dark brown proportions, a touch of char along their edges for good measure. Every single ounce of her palate melts together in precision and, for me, quaffing ecstasy. There are few beers I could quaff every day and not get tired of, and the Mikkeller Beer Geek Breakfast is one of those. Each mouth-filling quaff is liquid bliss: toast, oats, charred wood, black earth, dark fruits, licorice, espresso, vanilla, cream, and melted chocolate. I refuse to let this moment end, and eyes closed, I relive each moment that my empty glass no longer allows me to do.


Mikkeller, you have stolen my heart and I dont think I want it back. At least, not unless it comes with a complimentary bottle of Beer Geek Breakfast. Dont believe me? Sup on one yourself, and rediscover heavens nectar.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

I didnt think this one was excellent the first time mainly because I treated it like a high alcohol, low carbonation imperial stout. Chill to 45 degrees and pour with moderate head into a frosted glass and this one improves considerably. If served too warm, the carbonation overwhelms any real flavor. Great beer to introduce friends to big coffee-flavored stouts without slamming them with the high gravity stuff. 

Since this has an ABV of 7.5%, I consider the price pretty outrageous. Costs about as much as a pint at the Ritz Carlton.","Newport Beach, California, USA","mcbeyond"

The pour is opaque, oily black with with a clinging, chunky dark tan head that lingered throughout the whole beer.  The aroma was surprisingly mild with hints of roasted malts.  The flavor was a complex medley of deep roasted malts and dark roasted coffee.  This oatmeal stout had the body and complexity of an imperial but the drinkability of an oatmeal.  Creamy, oily and dry in the finish, this is a superb beer.","Kettering, Ohio, USA","Maddog"

Quite easy to drink, soft and quite high carbonation but it is nicely smooth. This beer based on strong roasted coffee, but still smooth and there are interesting nuancees.","Kaarina, FINLAND","TET"

Upon first tasting there is certainly a strong floral hop profile in addition to the chocolate, coffee and the roasted barley. On the aftertaste there is also a lingering taste of dark chocolate which has a slight sweetness to it, though the bitterness overall is more prevalent.  For a standard stout, this is very very delicious and complex. There are plenty of other great coffee tasting stouts out there but this one has more than just coffee going for it.

The finish has a slight hop bittering, piney, but is bittered from the roasted coffee as well.  Beautiful thick oliy mouthfeel.  Great beer, not as great as I expected.  I thought I was crazy when I first noticed a slight pilsner-like quality on the nose, until I read the label.  The oats come through on this to give a oatmeal aroma and thick mouthfeel.

Finishes without much lingering...so, its not much a lingerer..lingererer.

448,"2009-09-11",3.8,"This is a really nice imperial stout, but, once again, Im apparently a complete wimp when it comes to coffee stouts. The drinkability score is purely a reflection of my bodys annoying tendency to react strongly to the blending of alcohol and caffeine. At any rate, this beer pours dark and thick with a lasting mocha head. The aroma is a bit ashy and oddly mild compared to the flavor. The flavor is rich and full with big roasted malt, chocolate and coffee notes. Theres also a clear hop bitterness in the finish. The coffee flavor is not artificial like some coffee stouts but dark, complex and rich. The feel is smooth despite the bitter rich flavors. I just wish that my body didnt freak out so much when I drink coffee stouts. Its very odd because Im a regular coffee drinker and a regular beer drinker, but alas, here we are.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
448,"2009-09-10",4.4,"Bottle. Been wanting to try this for a while. Pours jet black, even held up to the light, with a big brown head that lasts for quite a while and leaves a lot of lacing. On the nose coffee and dark chocolate really stand out, but the notes of vanilla, roasted malt and cocoa are also very prominent, in addition to a little woodiness. In terms of flavour, the aroma says a lot of it, but the roasted grains are more at the forefront and there is an even stronger cocoa, or maybe mocha, presence. Smooth, creamy and very full bodied, this is a stout worth seeking out. The hype was just about spot on!","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","BeerChaser0078"
448,"2009-09-06",3.9,"Birthday beer purchased at the Davis Food Co-Op.  This aroma has a nice amount of burnt roastiness with some coffee hints, but not overly coffee-like.  There is an underlying sweet chocolate aroma present, which is nice.  Subtle hints of anise are also present.  Has a nice opaque dark brown/black body with a large, brown frothy head that leaves some really nice lacing.  Very attractive.  Roasty chocolate flavors dominate early, before it has a bit of an astringent acidity in the middle.  Finishes with the coffee flavors, which is nice.  A pretty flavorful brew, but the strange astringency in the middle hurts this beers score.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

Pours a deep black with a nice head.  It looks sexy, maybe the hype is right  So it begins.  The aroma was disappointing to say the least.  It was overpowered by a metallic hop.  Not at all what I was expecting from a big coffee stout.  You had to really get in there to get the coffee and chocolate.  Taste was WAY better than the smell.  There is  toasted oats, coffee, bitter dark chocolate, and hints of white chocolate.  Seems more like a chocolate stout than a coffee, until the finish.  There is a good bitter coffee finish.  Rounds out a rather complex beer.  Over all still a bit disappointing, but only because of the hype.  It is better than good, but not fantastic.","Waunakee, Wisconsin, USA","MrPickles"

448,"2009-09-03",4.6,"Rich aroma is like a fine roast coffee with a firm chocolate undertone and a hint of yeast. It pours a deep, opaque sable with a very thick cinnamon tan head that sticks around for a while. Flavor is more like fine mocha coffee than beer, but has hints of malt and yeast and a nutty touch so you know it is indeed brew. Flavor is oily smooth yet edgy, quite tingly and fizzy, leaving a smoky coffee finish that has an undertone of unsweetened chocolate.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
448,"2009-09-02",4.1,"Pours deep dark black with a hint of brown around the rim, huge fluffy tan coloured head. Nose has a heap of dark roasted malt, but not appearing astringent as some coffee beers do. The malt is perfectly rounded, some sweetness, some honeycomb, a touch of smoke & of course the coffee. Palate has surprisingly lively carbonation, not over the top but a touch more than i expected. Much like the nose, the malt is so well rounded. Has a bit of everything with the coffee standing out, but not overpowering. Finishes with rich coffee notes, but in no way astringent. Lively carbonation dries it up a touch as well. Hops are there, but play second fiddle to  the well controlled coffee notes. Awesome beer! Clearly alot of thought has gone into the malt selection and it has paid off, cant wait to try the weasel!!","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Chrism86"
448,"2009-09-01",4.0,"I have been wanting to try this beer since I first spotted it on the shelf and I finally plunked down the $14 to try a bomber. The pour is a not surprising inky-black with a dark brown head that reminds me of Bells Expedition it is so dark. The smell is heavy roasted coffee with oats lurking at the edges. The smell is really good if you like coffee. The taste seems to be more oat than coffee with some bitterness like dark chocolate at the end and then the coffee coming back to slap you in the face! The mouthfeel is neither too thin nor too syrupy, just right and the alcohol is well masked by the flavors of the beer. In my opinion this beats Founders Breakfast Stout by a hair or two. This was worth the price of admission but only for one viewing. If you are a coffee-beer fan then you should probably seek this one out.

448,"2009-08-22",3.8,"ust perfect in the appearance department. Incredibly thick and sticky head that changes color as it gets closer to the liquid. The liquid is used motor oil black and seems to pour pretty thick. This is the nicest looking pour Ive seen without a nitro widget.

Smells of oatmeal mash, meaning I have a thick mouthfeel to look foward to, but I digress. Coffee, roasted malts, light chocolate. Very good.

Taste is also the winner, exactly what I expected for a coffee oatmeal impy. With that said, Im guessing this one falls a little below the radar because similar drinks can be had a bit cheaper.

Mouth is thick, but not quite as thick as I had expected, and the drink is medium in carbonation.

With some other Coffee Oatmeal Imperials around here in easy supply, I dont think that Id go out of my way to trade for this one, but it is a damn good drink.","Donora, Pennsylvania, USA","Sonicdescent"

448,"2009-08-13",4.0,"The Norwegians have perfected the stout, and this is further proof.  The appearance is a very dark, oil black color totally opaque, with a well developed fully frothy brownish tan fluffy chocolate milk head that slowly subsides, into a thin 1/4 inch tan slice of foam, like all good head it comes to and, no pun intended, but with this head your close to spent by then.  Flavors range from a black coffee, hazlenut coffee, to tobacco, ultra dark roasty oak.  What it has in flavor it lacks in aroma, there remains a very earthy quality, with a somewhat present dark roasty barley malt alcohol aroma, as it warms to a more appropriate temperature the tobacco notes really become enhanced.  For such a flavorful beer the finish is utterly smooth, almost no char left in the palate, just a slight tinge of roasty bitter, as the beer warms to ideal temperature its tannins take on a more pronounced bitter flavor and finish.  As a side note, this beer is an excellent partner to a black and mild, or other chocolate dominant cigar.  Of course the better the cigar, the more intoxicating the experience.","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"

448,"2009-07-17",4.2,"500ml bottle.
Would have to say this is officially the first coffee stout ive ever tried, outside of the world of homebrew.

Perfect pour with a rocky brown head capping a sinfully black opaque body. Glass is painted brown all the way down.

Strong aroma, complex roasted malt; bitter cocoa, black coffee, burnt toast, smoke, stewed cereals, salty liquorice, charred wood. Some noticable hop citrus with undertones of vinous fruit and supporting alcohol.

Carbonation is relatively low, texture is velvet like, oily, very rich and thick, would be liqueur-like if wasnt counter-balanced with an obtrusive bitterness that seems to be both grain and hop derived.

Huge smack in the face of flavour on the body, like a shot of very strong and particularly fine espresso. Typical dark chocolate and burnt toffee in there bolstered by rich notes of toasted cereal, charred wood, smoked meat, earthy cinnamon, black grape tannin. Taste just lingers and lingers and then some, brutally drying and bitter, begging for more and enough to make you ignore the 7.5% alcohol in there.

Truely amazing stout. Totally not what I expected, yes, theres coffee in there and it does have the flavour of coffee, but theres so much more to it and the textures and complexities of flavour, well, you get the idea, its good!","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

448,"2009-07-09",4.2,"Original review date 6/3/2008...

Pours with ample carbonation. Jet-black root beer/motor oil body with huge pumpernickel head. Carbonation progresses slowly up through the lusciously viscous liquid.

Bittersweet chocolate malt, coffee and cinnamon sugar. Smells oily with some grassy/earthy hops. Nice stuff.

Slatey, dry stout feel-bitter coffee dominates at first when cold-a little more oiliness emerges with warmth.

Drinks silky-a little more shallow than expected, though. Charred bitter notes sustain through finish. Deeper and darker with warmth.

Pleasure to drink-a little lighter than expected. Solid, well-balanced and well-constructed.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

The aroma is superb with tons of rich chocolate and fresh coffee along with just a bit of roasted malt.  The flavor is much more heavily dominated by coffee than the aroma.  Its still quite nice, but much more one-sided.  Fresh coffee with roasted malt, tobacco and some chocolate.  Bitter coffee finish.

Nose is very roasty, with coffee, ash, oats, a savory woodsmoke note in there too. Palate is very coffeeish, nice mouthfeel, good acidity, nice fluffy ash character in the finish. Flavors of roast malt, smoke/hung meat. Absolutely no metallic or alcohol character at all. I find myself very susceptible to any metallic notes in a beer, especially dark beers.

Strong coffee flavours, NW hops, bitter cocoa, licorice and booze dominate the palate and linger, coating tooth and gum, sucking all moisture off the tongue and corners of the mouth.

448,"2009-04-26",4.2,"Appearance: Pours a deep black body with a large, creamy-looking, tan-head that, when I turned to look at the final moments of the film ""Monsieur Verdoux"", had grown to absolutely monstrous proportions. Good heavens!

Smell: Exceptionally roasty, aromatic nose of sweet-smelling dark chocolate-covered espresso beans, charred oats, and some oven-roasted caramel squares. Roast, roast and more roast.

Taste: The taste launches off with a sharp, highly roasted coffee extract flavor with malty touches of bittersweet chocolate, fire-scorched oats, chicory, and smoked black licorice. Lesser hint of vanilla. Faint blip of citrus hops buried under tons of roasted, malty rubble. The bold roasted bitterness ends up on a feedback loop as you drink. The aftertaste begins to turn a charry and acrid as it lingers almost indefinitely, but, as you make your way to the bottom of the bottle, the finish eventually smooths out, as flavors of sweet dark caramel, seared marshmallows, and burnt bread crumbs start to emerge. Finishes dry, very roasty, with a pure taste of chocolate-covered espresso beans carrying over from the aroma.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel.

Drinkability: As it begins to really hit its stride upon some very slight warming, the beer goes down unusually easy. It is very impressive, yes. Recommended.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

448,"2009-04-10",3.7,"A good looking stout with a very thick, dense head lighter in color than cinnamon.  The aroma (poured at appropriate temperature) was too hoppy.  Didnt actually smell much like Cascade hops or Centennial.  It surprised me to learn those were the hops used.  I think the best word to describe this brew is balance.   Every aroma and flavor worked together with nothing dominating.  For this price though, I was sort of looking to be dominated by something awesome (though technically I got it for free!).  I think the tiny amount of smoked malts was not noticeable, to my disappointment.  The oat really rounds out the flavor I think, imparting an ashy sort of greyness to the beer that I really enjoy.  I couldve used a bit more body too.  The superb balance of this beer led to the overall impression being high.",", Pennsylvania, USA","suchen"

Its complex but balanced, with coffee, dark roasted malt, campfire, light bourbon, vanilla, and caramel. Medium-bodied and creamy, though the harsh carbonation detracts a bit.

448,"2009-04-06",4.2,"500ml bottle. Pours a dark, opaque black with an immense brown head that is thick, tightly-bubbled, and long-lasting. It almost looks like a thick layer of mousse on top of a stout float. It slowly fades leaving huge chunks of foam on parts of the glass, like some sort of abstract sculpture. The aroma is rich and has a viscous, thick malt current and a very strong whiff of espresso. There are some semi-sweet chocolate, aromatic spice, dark fruit, ethanol, and light smoke components to the aroma, too. The flavor starts strong and very roasty - big on  coffee. There is an interesting quality - like some sort of aromatic spice - that is hard to identify. It is pleasant though and adds depth and complexity on the front of the tongue. The beer is mildly sweet at mid-tongue as some hop bitterness begins to enter - surprisingly earthy and spicy considering the description says Centennial and Cascade hops. At mid-palate, there is a lot of coffee and just a touch of citrus in the bitterness along with immense flavors of chocolate and very subtle caramel and dark fruit. The finish is dry and extremely roasty with a soft and pleasant citrusy bitter hop note (burps taste more like Centennial and Cascade that I recognize). The mouthfeel is full in body - thick and slippery but not quite syrupy - and has a medium level of carbonation that is crisp at first but soft as it goes down. Overall, a very interesting brew.

448,"2009-03-25",3.7,"Bottle. Enjoyed side by side with Founders Breakfast Stout. Stylistically, this struck me as more similar to some of the east coast stouts. This was noticeably thinner and less unctuous as the breakfast stout, but I respect it for not trying to overdo each component, but rather, to offer a well crafted, well extracted stout.  Flavors of soy, chicory, and a touch of smoke with Sumatran coffee on the finish. Nonetheless, it lacked the body and mouthfeel of what I equate with a stout ranked in the high 3s or low 4s on this site.

An abundance of mild black coffee beans throughout as well as a nice balancing chocolate and citrus hop backing. Finishes mild with a good lingering touch of all three main flavors. Palate is medium bodied, very smooth, and becomes more and more chewy as this warms up. Leaves a very fragile alcoholic burn on the tongue as it slightly warms on the way down.

448,"2009-02-14",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2011 500mL. Pours a very deep brown to near black with an extremely healthy tan head with infinite retention and big lace. Aroma is classic Danish stout: lots of olive brine, Kalamata, roast, spicy vanilla extract. Taste thankfully is only partially olive briny and adds lots of ultra bitter dark chocolate, cocoa powder, cocoa butter, slight roasted grain and earthy malt. Mouthfeel is soft and quite rich but this is on the high abv end for non-imperial stout.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Way too coffee in the nose, and a bit disturbing malt acidity. Coffee dominates flavour too. Why adding it when you can achieve the same and more elegant result with malt?

LOTS of bitter burnt coffee and moderate molasses taste. I could imagine hating this beer if I drunk it at the wrong time, but luckily today wasn’t such a time.

448,"2009-02-04",3.9,"the first thing you notice about this beer is how exceptionally dark it is. it pours quite violently with a dark chocolate head. the nose is roasted coffee and toasted malts with some latent bitter notes. much the same on the palate, the coffee is at the forefront but the chocolate and roast are also well presented. Finishes fairly hoppy with a lingering, heavy mouthfeel. great breakfast beer if your not eating much, as it is quite filling.","Anchorage, Alaska, USA","chuck316"

Smooth palate, with a little acidic or astringent bite coming from either coffee or black malts. Its heavy on oats so that too could contribute to some of the astringency here. Long roasted finish. Fairly dry, but not thinned out, which is good.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

448,"2009-02-01",3.6,"16.9 fl oz bottle.  Light and airy aroma, not as heavy on the coffee as maybe i was expecting, but definitely there, cereal malts, and some roasted black malts as well.  Head on the pour looks nice, medium sized and chocolate milk in color, stays pretty nicely, and the beer itself is rather coffee like in color and in the appearance of the body.  Much more coffee in the flavor than the smell, quite creamy, but not as many roasted notes as expected, also some mixed grains, cereal-like malt throughout, with a very malty malt finish if that makes any sense.  The beer was very well balanced though and very full bodied to point of almost having a consistency similar to a breakfast shake.  In all honesty i wasnt all that crazy about this one, but could how certain people would rate it pretty high.  This one just wasnt exactly to my liking, but i havent seemed to like much of this breakfast stout style either.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"
448,"2009-01-31",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 1, 2009 Aroma: A traditional stout smell hits you right away, but as you go deeper into the glass you really begin to notice the intense aroma of (duh!) coffee beans.  I seriously love the smell of dark-roasted bitter coffee and there is all kinds of it going on in this glass.  Another smell and I get a nice touch of molasses and a very faint smell of roasted almonds.  There is not a whole lot of chocolate in this one for me, which I suppose is just fine.  Appearance: This is the color youd expect for a stout  black.  I poured rather softly and still got about two or three fingers of nice warm light brown head.  A short but brisk swirl of the glass will bring back a nice little head to enjoy with the next sip.  Flavor: Yep, this is really full of coffee flavors that immediately hit my tongue.  Once down, it leaves behind the slightest bit of tartness, and Im certainly not tasting the 7.5% ABV.  So I guess all I need now is some waffles and bacon to wash this down.  Palate: Although this is an extremely flavorful stout, I really dont feel like its too heavy on the palate.  The thickness is moderate.  For as much intensity as it brings, it does a really nice job of moving along down your throat.  Overall Impression:  Beer Geek Breakfast is without a doubt the most appropriate name for this beer.  If you are any sort of a stout and/or strong coffee lover, you will not be let down by this brew.  Thank goodness I havent even made it half way through this bottle yet because Im felling pretty happy.   One thing I can assure you of is that the next time I open one of these beers, its going to be breakfast for dinner at my house.","Olathe, Kansas, USA","amneziak"

448,"2009-01-28",4.3,"What a great pour!  Thick and rich black beer with a big tan head akin to shaving cream.  Thick sticky lacing.  The nose is pleasant with roasted notes, coffee,chocolate, and dark fruit.  In the mouth the beer is thick and powdery.  It offers a hop based effervescent zing that causes pin pricks on the tongue.  Flavors are coffee, chocolate, spice, and a surprisingly big hop bite that meets the malt eye to eye.  This beer combines big flavors with amazing subtleties.

448,"2009-01-22",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 15, 2009 500mL bottle from a local group order. Pours out a beautiful pitch black, with a medium brown coloured head. The aroma is just awesome, exactly what I love in a stout. Roasty as hell, tons of coffee and burnt toast, but with a really nice piney hoppy edge and a sweet molasses component adding balance. Flavour perfectly reflects the aroma, with a very sharp biting bitterness that is just awesome. Theres a good 2cm of sludge at the bottom of the bottle, which on its own smells surprisingly hoppy and IMHO is delicious. A slight sour touch in the finish that seems to be from the yeast or oats, it fits. Goes great with the rest of the beer too. Awesome body what with the ample amount of oats,  and surprisingly carbonated. This is probably the best stout Ive had to date, theres just nothing not to like about it. It really would be a great breakfast beer!","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"
448,"2009-01-22",4.5,"Bottle. Poured black viscous body with a thick yet fluffy chocolate colored head that resembled the cellular structure of bread. Aroma was very pleasant and very sweet. Redolent of coffee obviously, chocolate, oak, vanilla, sweet oat malt and acidic hops - which blended together into a sort of maple syrup-citrus flavor which was amazing. The flavor was sweetly malty then strong bitter coffee (good), citric hops and a carbonated bite that left only a lingering bitter roast and oak finish. The palate was also intensely comforting; creamy and smooth without being heavy or soporific. I would eat this on my wheaties any day.","Glenside, Pennsylvania, USA","Jsawyer"

Lots of inviting roast in the nose. Full bodied, but not too thick with a smooth texture. Flavor of burnt malts, coffee, and unsweetened dark bakers chocolate. Not much residual sweetness. Some astringency on the dry finish, that leaves a lingering coffee ground bitterness on the palate .Bitterness mellows  at room temp, and is more enjoyable. Perhaps past its prime, but no signs of oxidation.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"

448,"2009-01-06",4.0,"07 bottle from Bottleworks. Pours a shiny black, with a dark mocha head. Thick pour. The aroma has a lot of coffee, layered over sugary cacao and vanilla. Flavor is definitely coffee-heavy, roasty, dark and bitter. There’s a surprising lack of chocolate in the flavor, which I’m so used to in big stouts. I could absolutely see having this with breakfast - coffee notes, and a somewhat mild flavor, all things considered. I simply think stouts need to be bigger than this.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"
448,"2009-01-05",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2010 My first beer of 2009 and this is certainly a good one. Pours black in color and generates a big fluffy brownish-tan head. Great head retention, lacing after each sip. At first the aroma consists of molasses, chocolate and toasty bold coffee beans. I taste those three flavors as well, however the molasses are rather mild compared to the heavy chocolate and coffee, which is bold and roasted but also a touch creamy. The beer is capped off by a generous dose of bitter piney hops which I also pick up in the aroma as the beer has warmed a bit. What I love about this beer is that is is packed with flavor while being very drinkable. Im not sure Im going to start drinking this for breakfast but I do look forward to having it again. Great start to the new year!","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"
448,"2009-01-05",4.2,"Drank from a 16.9 oz bottle. Poured a dark black (syrupy consistency) with a finger and a half of tan foam which stays for a while.  The smell is strongly of oatmeal, with a whiff of coffee at the end, very delightful.  After the first taste, I am surprised with how smoothly it goes down. Also, this is a true breakfest stout, with the main flavor being that traditional with an oatmeal stout, but it follows up with a coffee taste/aftertaste, which is very pleasing. Also, the lacing on this beer is nice, as it sticks to the glass quite well. Overall, a very good beer, and the best breakfest stout I have had (though I look forward to Founders Breakest Stout).","Highland Park, Illinois, USA","soccer290"

448,"2008-12-26",4.6,"Pours deep and dark almost black brown with thin ruby highlights. The head is a huge and long lasting creamy, capuccino colored froth. It really explodes as you pour (I ended up with a pretty decent puddle on the kitchen counter) and leaves a substantial amount of tan lacing. Aroma is coffee, roast, a hint of char, toffee, milk chocolate, nutty nougat and some herbal, bitter hops. Flavor starts off with a great coffee taste, better than most coffees I have had. The oats are definitely present, possibly stronger than I have tasted in any other stout along with a nice toasted malt and sweet fresh barley note. There are plenty of milk chocolate, nut and vanilla flavors- almost as if I am eating a box chocolates but without the sickeningly sweet part. The finish is chocolate, herbal hops, plenty of dark roast coffee and a little burnt sugar. Body is medium, with a dry start and finish but sweet, creamy middle, a touch of alcohol towards the end and a cream covered vlevet feel throughout. This is a great stout, I have wanted to try this for a long while and BAM! it just shows up in my local beer store one day....friggin sweet.

This is a beautiful beer.  The aroma is predominately oatmeal and a surprisingly noticeable hop sting.  The body is full, chewy and just a bit oily.  The oatmeal smoothness rounds out the coffee bitterness quite nicely. The medium-to-high alcohol content does not make an appearance in the flavor or palate, bringing down the complexity of the beer.  This does not detract from the beer as it is classified as a stout and not an imperial stout.  The finish is grainy and brings to mind course bread.  This would be a wonderful beer to drink with cheese soup.

Speaking of oat, where I see it contributing the most is to the body of this beer.  It is thick and almost grainy, which makes for an awesome drinking experience.

Thankfully, someone checked in the cellar and they had an extra bottle tucked away! This baby poured thick, deep, black, and ready to drink.

Super smooth mouthfeel, rounded flavours of coffee (not freeze-dried stuff, mind you; but freshly ground gourmet beans). Some hints of sweetness. Finish was amazing. Coffee, coffee, and more coffee....lasting way into the night and ruining the palate for any other beers that might have been consumed.

Oh, and more coffee. Acrid, even through the aftertaste. There are thankfully some minor grassy hops that keep it from it becoming lava, especially as it warms. Its definitely dry, perhaps creamy, and with some warmth comes carbonation, but is there such a thing as carbonated coffee?

Rich and coating in the mouth, not quite full bodied. Carbonation a bit too aggressive. The coffee comes to life in the taste, with assertive notes of espresso. Bittersweet chocolate and pine hops add to the dry and roasty profile. I can’t pick up any oatmeal notes.

448,"2008-05-23",4.3,"I was extremely pleased to see Mikkeller bringing their Beer Geek Breakfast Stout to my neck of the woods.  Everything from their reputation to their stylistic typography and label design favored an outstanding beer experience.  And I wasnt disappointed.  Though I didnt think a beer this would pare well with any breakfast (maybe an ogres breakfast) I didnt have second thoughts about it as a nightcap.  The head is a carnivorous ribeye cooked to rare pink color, with a little light brown round the periphery.  This head lasts about as long in my glass as perfectly cooked rare prime ribeye would, and thus settles to a light lily pad of brown fuzz.  The body is predictably black - deep sea darkness, engulfing both mentally and physically.  The pour matches the color with its oily slow-motion free fall into the goblet.  Along with the short-lived head, the pour produces a stunning gaseous mix, such that coffee, bourbon, black pepper, potters soil, yam, grilled sweet corn and mesquite put my senses under siege in a hazy and confused reverie of flavor.  In an act of mercy (though I do enjoy the aromatic punishment - beer masochism?) the flavor is plainer, though no less intense.  Coffee astringency is bolder, with more oozing dark chocolate and a heavier starch vegetable flavor base, also making up some of the perceived mouthfeel and body.  The beginning of the flavor run has the slightest edge of chocolate sweetness, but the rest is a hurtling through a gradually narrowing tunnel of dark, mostly bitter flavors.  I am reeling, desperate to fight my way out of the shroud of heavy flavors, struggling like a fish caught in a net, but find it mostly exhilarating.  When Im done and the glass has returned to its normal empty clarity (though with slivers of dark shadowy liquid here and there) I am relieved and regretful, much as an adventurer would be at the end of a harrowing journey of peril.  Also, I still cant imagine washing down eggs, toast and granola with Mikkellers take on chasm-colored beer.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
448,"2008-05-22",4.0,"Bottle purchased and enjoyed at Kulminator, Antwerp.  Smells of port, melted chocolate, and alcohol, with a bit of wet coffee bitterness testifying to the roasted malts and hops.  Taste is roasty at first on lively carbonation; the middle gets creamy with dark chocolate semi-sweetness and fuller body, the chocolate turning dry like Bakers chocolate until he dry coffee grounds in the finish.  Pours completely opaque with an unremarkable head, appetizing like all stouts but nothing special.  Tasty, but the feel was not as dynamic, smooth, or full as I like in my stouts (I guess its not as big as I thought at only 7.5%).  Id prefer Founders Breakfast or Peche Mortel.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"
448,"2008-05-21",4.4,"Bottle.  Wow this is a pretty beer!  Pours black with a dark brown head.  Aroma is awesome as well, dominated by coffee and chocolate.  The aroma is not overpowered by roast, as I often find with many other stouts.  Also a rich sweetness from the malt and unfermented sugars makes this aroma irresistable.  Flavor is lots of coffee, sweet malt, well-balanced.  This beer has a very nice mouthfeel with the richness of an imperial stout.  The first time that I had this beer, I was unimpressed.  But after having many other stouts, imperial stouts, and porters and trying this again, I was incredibly impressed!

448,"2008-04-13",3.9,"Bottle. Let me begin by saying that I had extremely high expectations for this beer due to A. The $$$$$ and B. the high review scores. It poured almost black with a nice tan head. Aroma strong of roasted malts and coffee. Flavor much the same as aroma, a little more of a dry roastiness than the creaminess that I taste in many oatmeal stouts. Not a bad beer, but seriously overhyped. It seems as though everyone wants to see some European beers come out that rival the best of the American craft super-brews(IIPAs, BWs, & RISs, etc.), but I havent had anything beyond a few assorted Belgians(and these are in distinctly Belgian styles and are sort of apples to oranges compared to tAmerican beers) that touch the American brews. They are, however, headed in the right direction.

Thanks to Drew for picking up a bottle of this for me a few months ago.  Ive just now gotten around to giving it a try in celebration of rating 775.  Im a little disappointed to find this is not a Top 50 beer.  Instead it is simply a solid coffee stout with some buzz.  At the cost of a bomber Im not likely to pick up another one unless it is for trade.
Aroma / Appearance - The black oily body was just as I expected a top flight stout to look.  The dark tan head lingered for a while before deciding to subside.  Chocolate, black coffee, anise and peanut butter mud pie intermingled in a solid but not earth shattering combination.  I was expecting just a little but more complexity but could not find it.
Flavor / Palate - Black coffee and plum tickle the tongue before the watery mouthfeel hits the throat.  Its not so thin as to be lifeless but did not meet my expectations.  The finish reminds me of a cheap breakfast of slightly overcooked toast, dry plain oatmeal and coffee made from beans which have been burned.  While it is a solid cohesive beer I was not blown away.  Still your mileage may vary so give it a try if you like stouts.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Flavor is heavy laden with coffee notes, with lots of dry bitter coffee beans dominating the palate.  Also present is some grassy hoppiness, perhaps only the slightest note of bitter chocolate, and some light alcohol.  Finishes quite bitter and roasty.  Body is farily full and quite soft.  A rich stout that has well-crafted flavors, though I would have liked some more sweetness to balance the bitterness of the beer.  Granted, I take sugar in my coffee, which might explain why the coffee bitterness, though well-executed, seemed somewhat overwhelming to me.   Well-made, even if marginally outside my range of preference.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"
448,"2008-02-22",4.1,"Bottle on 2/16/08. Black pour, creamy, medium,  light brown head that settles slowly. The coffee, dark and espresso like, is unmistakable, and ushers in dark chocolate, vanilla, and some pine notes as well. Smooth, rich, full mouthfeel complemented by light carbonation. Roasted malt flavors up front, with bitterness following quickly, but not too excess. Finishes dry without any significant stickiness.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"

It laces and laces and stays frothy. Initially, the nose is of mint leaves and coffee beans. But as it warms, it bursts with dark chocolate, American hops, vanilla, some oatmeal, wood, and roasted malts. In the flavour department, its full on bitter coffee, with minty herbal hops, dark chocolate, vanilla extract and roasted malts. Creamy, creamy, creamy. Very easy drinking with no hint of the ABV. Long, minty, bitter finish. This is very good. Outstanding. Thanks goes out to Greg Clow, who was kind enough to send me this bottle. I appreciate it!","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"

This is perhaps the most beautiful pour I have ever seen ... solidly black gold, mesmerizing cascade of tan foam rising and falling into a solid foam head of deep tan.  The aroma is killer ... robust roasted malt and sweet milk and sugar.  This drinks with a velvety smoothness.  The flavors are beautiful and complex, some kind of blend of bitter baking chocolate, java, licorice, and thick roast.  Like a good hot chocolate, this leaves a messy sludge at the finish.

Initial sip very smooth and thick.  Chocolate, coffee, malt, all in proportion and balance.

The finish is very nice, even with something as strong as this, there is nothing lingering out of place.  Very nice, especially if you like good dark coffee.","Alabama, USA","BrotherBenny"

Pours pitch black with a very dark tan head. Nose is definitely chocolate. Nice and dark cocoa tones to it. Flavor is pretty good, though I have to say I dont think it really holds up to the look and whiff of things. Definite thick malty goodness going on here. Roasted tones are there in a mild sense. Feel is thick on the liquid and has a lower carbonation. Id say it is what youd expect from the style. Overall a good beer.

448,"2008-01-17",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 13, 2009 Bottle. Aroma as good as it can get, hence the 10. Strong notes of typical stout aromas, coffee, chocolate, dark malts, lightly citrusy hop presence, but what puts this over the top is a luscious presence of rich, sweet alcohol meshing, blending, and supporting the other aromas. The flavor sort of falls back a bit. The same notes are there, but the alcohol seems to just sit there for me without adding and blending, leading to some sips tasting really, really good, other sips feeling a little light on flavor and heavy on alcohol. Palate also fluctuates from this odd alcohol presence, sometimes feeling weak, but by the end of the beer feels nothing other than rich and silky smooth. From the aroma, I was expecting a no-question Top 50 brew, but in the mouth I still had some questions. 10-5-7-4-14/4.0Rerate after having consumed many bottles, too lazy to say much, but there are many coffee beers and many stouts/impy stouts I prefer to this and it just doesnt get the job done in comparison for me.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"

448,"2008-01-14",3.4,"Cellar-aged two years: Penetrable black. Creamy beige ring of head surrounds a broken center. Decent aroma of ink, soy sauce, charcoal, and chocolate-covered espresso beans. Mild waft of smoke. Tight, spongy carbonation. Thin body. Quite airy with subtle phenols and dry roast, initially, yet bittersweet and succulent at the center, as chocolate-infused raisins and dried plums primarily exude. Whispers of smoke and bright java soon link up with the brisk char to deepen the rich malts. Substantial dryness lifts the fruity esters and unveils a forceful espresso and cocoa-tinged bitterness which remain strong throughout. Acidic twinge gently buckles the cheeks and lessens, rather than underscore, the malt complexity. Gritty char unrelentingly scratches at the fruity surface. Anticlimactic finish is curiously empty, as bittersweet espresso echoes hints of burnt cookies and metallic char. While some extra age hasnt necessarily hurt this, it certainly hasnt helped as its now overly dry, and hollow as a result. The high score is a bit puzzling. Sure, coffee and chocolate make for a savory combination, but it takes much more than that (finesse, balance, cleanness, etc.) for a beer to reach elite status. On top of that, the yeast fails to impart anything uniquely of character. Decent overall.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Dark black body with a massive creamy brown Aero bar like head. Fairly acidic roat in the aroma at first, plentiful accents of chocolate and mocha. Flavour is surprisingly bitter both from the hops and roast malt/coffee bitterness. Gets smoothed out by an underlying sweet malt and chocolate base. The bottle has been waiting for me for a while so I am wondering if the coffee has mellowed somewhat in the meantime. If so it was for the better in my opinion, I was expecting much more of a coffee-bomb, which would not have been to my liking as much. Smooth full bodied palate.

Fresh coffee roast, dappled with light barbecue and nibblings of tobacco. Rich and right there, but not out of control. An extremely decent coffee stout nose, detailed and inviting. Pours the color of ink, with a teak fringe and fast fading rim of espresso love. Flavor is a well built, yet quickly moving dry stout. Theres the palpable sea beans, bright saltine cracker, and clam juice intertwining with toffees, coffee-tinted chocolate and long roastiness. A real impression of dryness throughout, but not acidity, bitterness or harshness. No detectable alcohol. Some interesting yeast products, with some bites of ester that mingle with the fruitiness of the coffee and play off the salty, grain-earth dryness. A long draw sup of detectable minty hops mingle with a glass of sherry. If anything, phenomenal brewing. Surprisingly not overly bold, in my opinion. Tending towards a more restrained, mature presentation of a well integrated oatmeal coffee stout. Thanks Rudy!","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

A bold nose - initially citrus hoppy, but as it warms a bit the bouquet springs forward - dark chocolate and smooth black coffee, lightly roasted malts. The mouthfeel is very firm, one of the best bodies Ive ever experienced. I wish I were more eloquent - firm and full, but not oily or creamy. Like a dense bitter chocolate cake or something. Solid espresso flavors, mildly bitter, with some bittersweet chocolate and just a hint of citrus. Dry roasty coffee finish, some burnt chocolate and prune.

Great bitter finish.. Had this beer again at a tasting last month and it paired GREAT with a milk chocolate bar that I brought with me. Add this at the end of a meal with a rich chocolate tort or a slice of cheesecake and you will not be disappointed..

Flavor is purely roasted malts, coffee and cocoa, dusty and lightly sweet, bittersweet, then drying out substantially towards the finish.  A good bit of coffee throughout, here.

448,"2007-10-30",4.1,"Pours an oily, thick, viscous, black with no opacity whatsoever.  The hed is a shade akin to a Mahogany color, but slightly more brown than red. The aroma is a melange of roasted malts and dark roast columbian coffee. There is evidence of some piney, floral hops, however it is very light. The flavor at first is very astringent with the bitterness of both the roasted malts and the coffee flavors dominating the whole profile. After some warming, the sweetness of milk chocolate came through and played well with the bitterness of the coffee, which had toned itself down quite a bit. The body of the beer became very creamy and soft at this point. The beer just felt ultra luxurious. This is what you would drink to take you away from a bad day. The feeling will overwhelm any negativity that could stay with you through to the bottle opening. Strangely the hops that were evident on the nose are barely evident on the palate. Must be some creative timing of the hop additions to the boil.  My overall impression of this beer is that it actually doesnt provide good material for a review in this format. It is a decadent and rich expression of a strong, potentially overwhelming style of beer. It is much more than the some of its parts","Bloomfield, New Jersey, USA","dogfishho"

Some nice, thick lacing coated the entire inside of the glass.  The aroma of the brew consisted of milk chocolate, coffee, oats, and also roasted malts.  The flavor was made up of freshly ground coffee, rich dark chocolate, and burnt malts.  The flavor left a slightly lasting dry, roasty bitterness on the tounge.  The mouthfeel was very creamy and medium to full-bodied with light carbonation.  This was truly an excellent stout.  The rich coffee flavor with the soft, creamy mouthfeel makes for one great brew.

The expresso coffee ruled the day and coupled with the roast, dark chocolate and raisin characteristics in the background led to a complex and interesting aroma. The beer poured into the glass pitch black with a ruby highlight and a dark brown frothy head which fell slowly and coated the glass from start to finish.  The flavor was ultra smooth and silky with espresso coffee and roasted malts in excellent balance with nice chocolate and caramel. Raisins lurked in the flavor and that same nice grassy nature was present from the hops. The bittering was strong yet restrained by the malt. The finish was dry, but not bone dry, with lasting impressions of grass, coffee, chocolate and roast. The body was full and heading toward viscous with a less than moderate level of carbonation and an ultra smooth, silky and creamy texture on the palate.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Appearance dark, opaque black with a huge, foamy, tan head that mostly diminished. The aroma was heavy strong coffe malt, cream and salt. The initial flavor was lightly sweet, moderately bitter and salty, while the finsh was heavily sweet and bitter, and slaty with an average duration. The flavor had some chocolate but was mostly coffee. Its like a sweetened coffee. Just a little bit of almost soapy hop bitterness that keeps it from being perfect.

This beer poured a really nice brownish black with a great looking burnt brown head that lasted for just about the entirety of the beer.

Flavors area good combination of the chocolate and coffee, but just not as overpowering as I was hoping for in such a highly regarded coffee impy stout.  The flavor also not so great presence of unwanted coffee astringency.

Beer Geek Breakfast pours midnight black on a moonless night. No light pushes through the body of this beer. A two finger brown head rises on the pour and fades to a skimming leaving lacing on its way down. Thick silky patchy lacing is left behind after each sip.

Aroma begins with a roasty maltiness and a touch of lactic. Moderate room temp. coffee comes through in the middle along with something that reminds me of crayons. Piney and spicy hops along with bakers chocolate and a lactic quality come through on the backend. The aroma is very nice but a little more subdued than I wouldve liked.

Roasty malts kick things off and play a major role throughout. A little hop spiciness comes through in the middl getting even spicier with a quick flash of alcohol. Coffee bean, bakers chocolate and that mild lactic quality show themselves on the end along with a nice wave of mildly piney and spicy hops. Excellent flavor!

Mouthfeel may be a little on the thin side but Im still undecided. Its thinner than Id expect but I like it quite a bit. The more I sip the more Im starting to dig the mouthfeel. Leaves a mild lingering hop and roasty malt bitterness.

The thinner than expected mouthfeel makes this beer go down way too quickly. I keep having to slow myself down.

Good beer from Mikkeller. I sampled this right after sampling a Founders breakfast stout. The two are totally different beasts and I like the direction both of them have taken. Hopefully Ill be drinking some more Mikkeller brews in the future.

Bomber from SS summer 07
Pour thick and rich, pitch black with a foamy dense brown head.  The head lasts the length of the beer, and leaves behind some nice lace.
The initial aroma is of oats, strong coffee, and hops.  A bit of a lactic note, maybe.  There is certainly a bit of a twang.  I think the oat can give you a bit of that as well.
Strong coffee with creamer flavors from the initial taste all the way to the bitter finish.  As it warms up the hops come out fighting.  BAM!! Right in the fn teeth.
The mouthfeel is so full.  Very rich and dense.  I want to use the term thin pudding but that doesnt sound so nice.  But is is very thick so I suppose that get the point across.  There also quite a bit of carbonation.
This is easily on of the best beers Ive had the pleasure of drinking in quite a while.  To the folks at Mikkeller.  Outstanding show.  Please under no circumstance put this beer in a barrel.  That would be a crime to humanity.  And to SS, many thank you.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"

Let it warm for awhile and enjoy the full bodied darkly roasted experience.  Its also got moderately strong hops that are even more apparent in the finish.  This is not a sweet stout.

448,"2007-09-20",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2008 Black body with an initially medium tan head.  Aroma is very roasted, fresh citrusy hops and pastry dough.  Main flavours are the usual three amigos: roastiness, chocolate and coffee beans.  The chocolate flavour is not like black bitter chocolate, it is more like rich chocolate cake with a sweet chocolate cream.  The high roastiness level (may be a bit too roasted) detracts the attention away from the rich and smooth chocolate.  The roasted coffee beans flavour are there but not as upfront as with many breakfast stouts.  A very pleasant astringency lighten up the experience.  This generously hopped beer develops some kind of green apples flavour/astringency in the finish that makes a bottle go down even more quickly.  Full but silk body with soft carbonation.

Pour is really thick and blackish brown with a short-lived brown head that, with time dies down to a thin film on the surface with a few bubbles rising above the etched area on the bottom.  Aromas are strongly charcoal-ish with lots of peat and espresso.  Maybe there is a bit of an anise seed tilt to it, too.  Mouthfeel is silky and exquisit.  The smokey charcoal flavor leads the charge, but is quickly supported by some espresso, dark chocolate and peat... and I think that Im picking up some of that anise in the background.  Very smooth and I could probably drink several bombers of it before I realized what a bad idea that was.  For a plain Jane stout, this is fantastic... I must say that, while at first I was a little disappointed (expecting some sort of trumpet blast or other sort of epiphany/divine experience and not finding it) this really grew on me as I worked my way through the bottle... take your time, enjoy it and let it air and warm.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

Ive wanted to try this one for a long time. Pours a deep inky black with a relatively short-lived crema head that leaves behind intense lacing. The aroma is intense: roasty chocolate malts laced with blackberry juice and coffee icing. Heavy oat-stout flavors lead off the flavor profile, tasty but not too sweet, a slight lacto-sourness, hints of berry leading to a wonderful roundness of both flavor and palate through the middle before yielding to what one expects to be a imperial-stout hop close but instead offers a balanced bitterness driven entirely by the coffee, leaving one with the feeling that one has just down an espresso (from a roast that is dark but not at all burnt)  and is savoring the oils that linger on the tongue; baking chocolate and again hints of oat peek through in places and add interest to the finish.

The mouthfeel is excellent throughout. As smooth as can be, creamy but not heavy or oily, absolutely no alcohol presence on the tongue (though there is a hint in the aroma). Beautiful. 

Overall an excellent beer.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
448,"2007-08-31",4.6,"Bought this bottle from State Line a few weeks ago and opening it today in honor of Michael Jacksons passing.  Sticky-sweet coffee stout aroma with a huge, room-filling level of roast.  Chocolate and cocoa.  Soul-sucking, black hole black pour, as opaquely black as imaginable with a dark brown, fluffy head that richly reaches its way up the sides of the glass and offers a truly beautiful meniscus.  Taste of darkly roasted gourmet coffee with occasional flashes of chocolate and cocoa powder; very dry (water-sucking, quickly dehydrating) with a nearly unbelievably true-to-life espresso aftertaste - should I have served this in a tiny cup and consumed it with raised pinky?  Slightly burned with a touch of lactose, though I may be mistaking the latter for the oats.  Bitterness here is understated and tactful, with very faint hop prickling toward the back.  Great balance!  As for feel, one of the few beers to truly earn the term ""velvety"", as this is luscious and swirling smoothness in fullish-medium form.  Its not reaching to say the oatmeal adds a lot here - in both sultry smoothness and the occasional oaten note.  Alcohol here is so well integrated as to not be noticed, and therein lies the paradox; this big boy features all the robustness and flavor of a well-made imperial stout but without the potentially catastrophic hangover effects.  Classy yet decadent - it just blows the competition away!","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

448,"2007-08-25",3.8,"Pours a dark dark brown to black with a decent light brown to tan head, diminishing.  The nose is basic coffee stout.  Theres a full bodiedness to this beer that goes beyond weak as shit coffee stout, but this lacks the umph of a coffee imperial stout.  Rond sweetness, but still that acrid coffee sweetness like in Schlaflys Coffee Stout is still there.  Otherwise, the profile has more in common with Founders Breakfast Stout.    Thick on the palate without too much carbonation and decent viscosity.  The nose predicts the flavors well.  Too much of that coffee flavor that disagrees with me.  The oats give a soft sweetness, that I think should be slightly amped up.  Not that this is too harsh with sweetness.  The coffee roast comes on strong in a surprisingly dry clean finish.

The taste is at first one dimensional, but as the beer warms up the layers unfold and leave a profoundly thick and oily beer with varying levels of coffee and hop bitterness and a roundness that is only equaled in the worlds best beers.  This is one awesome beer.  Finally, as the beer is completely drunk the hop bitterness and slight citrus linger on the palate and mix with the residual coffee sourness for ages- and it makes me wish I had another one of these beers to drink.  Outstanding beer, but a little thin in the finish.","Kirkwood, Missouri, USA","xmarcnolanx"

448,"2007-07-02",4.2,"First thing thank you Ron for somehow obtaining this beer that just hit the U.S. less than a month ago. I brushed my teeth and took a shower before opening this to be in perfect form to indulge on what I expect to be one of the best beers Ive had yet. Complete black pour like a black hole suckin the lifeforce out of anything in its path, big finger thick dark brown head that fades to a small brown head and stays. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, mollassess, and oats when swirled. Now to finally taste..... A shot of espresso to the face, its so freakin roasty its like it was brewed 30 seconds ago. The espresso is there and it dominates but not to the point of being harsh or bitter its very smooth. More roasted coffee, it takes coffee to a whole nother level, you get a shot of espresso, freshly brewed coffee, it taste like coffee beans were in the secondary, it just has coffee in every way imaginable. Very smooth and creamy with a higher level of carbonation that tingles my tongue with coffee goodness, medium mouthfeel and very cloying leaving me licking my entire mouth. I cant stop sipping this beer. The other flavors are really being pushed aside by the coffee which is a little dissapointing but then again they made this to be a coffee beer for breakfast, chocolate sits in the background and the oats leave a grainy taste. A little on the sweet side as it warms with a touch of sugary chocolate coming through. I think I will take a brief intermission and allow this to warm..... Im liking how the chocolate is coming out more, milk chocolate all the way because of the slight sweetness and silky smoothness. Damn this beer is smooth. The coffee is still dominating I know its suppose to be this way but I do wish itd be a little more than just one-dimensional. I think the caffeine is hitting me, theres more oomph in this than the Folgers I had this morning thats for sure. Overall its coffee all the way, with light notes of chocolate and a slight sugary sweetness as well, but basically this is alcoholic coffee. As it warms even further a big charcoal smokiness comes through as well blending with the coffee like a madman. I liked it a lot but I have to say its not one of ""the"" best Ive ever had.

Essentially opaque oily brown-black, red around the edges, huge lasting foamy-creamy brown head, even lovely drapes of tan lace left behind.

The taste is very good - bakers chocolate, strong coffee, dry herbal hops, less lactose character, pretty solid deep roast bitterness by the end, moderate alcohol.  Silky, decently full but not thick body, almost oily, not sticky at all, feels great on the tongue, lasting but not coating, light astringency, more acidity than you initially think, with a smooth, long lingering finish - perhaps a little bit weak in the finish.

448,"2007-04-22",3.8,"Sampled March 2007
This is a very dark brew, it is quite opaque and is quite black as it sits in my glass.  It is topped by a billowing, easily three-finger thick, light chocolate brown colored head.  Ah, the aroma is so nicely roasted; smelling of chocolate, espresso, lightly roasted coffee, a touch of burnt grain husks.  It has this underlying, but always evident, decadent dark malt note that makes it smell like a lightly sweet, dense, dark dessert; perhaps a dessert that is a mix of chocolate and coffee, but there is an unmistakable, complex malty sweetness here in the aroma as well.  This just smells so decadent.  Up front the aroma smells quite burnt & perhaps a touch sharp, but it quickly picks up a richness that is just so compelling; this is certainly a beer that I can easily spend a few minutes sampling just the aroma.

The first sip hits my tongue, at first it seems a bit lighter in the body than I was expecting.  A roast acidity seems to lighten the effect of this brew, but then the malt kicks in and this brew becomes quite chewy and rich, just like the aroma promised.  It starts out with roasted coffee & barley malt notes, then picks up notes of chocolate and darkened malt sugars.  It finishes with a lingering sweet notes reminiscent of sweet dark chocolate and a touch of espresso acidity.  As my palate gets used to this brew it seems to lose a bit of that initial richness, perhaps the burnt acidity becomes a bit too acrid for the other competing flavors to compete with.  It is still quite tasty, though I might recommend not drinking this on an empty stomach, the acidity seems to be causing me some, though extremely mild, stomach discomfort.

While the flavor is quite nice, I think that the aroma is better; it is richer and fuller, with a better complexity to it.  If the complete beer lived up to the initial aroma this beer would be just about perfect.  The mouthfeel of this seemed to fizzle a bit after the first couple of sips.  Ultimately this is a great beer, it is just that after the first couple of sips this promised to be a stunning beauty of beer; or perhaps better said is started out so decadent and rich, but then took on a lighter tone.  As most beer geeks know, it is better to have the lighter less powerful beers first in a session and move ones way up to the more powerful brews; not the other way around like this brew seems to do.  As it is though, it is still a great beer, one which I would be happy to have easy access to.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

448,"2007-03-04",4.0,"20.5 oz bottle.  Pours a pitch black with a half-finger mahogany head.  The aroma is of roasted coffee and chocolate.

448,"2007-03-01",4.5,"66 cL bottle. Pours completely black with a huge creamy head, almost looks like chocolate cream. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee. I have to admit that the aroma is weak compared to the taste that follows - my oh my. creamy mouthfeel. Taste is very complex yet in perfect balance. First and foremost: Im so happy not to encounter yet another helltauer beer :). There is coffee and bitter hops together with tart bitterness of the chocolate that is providing a differentiated bitterness through a sip.  Starts hop bitter, then coffee followed by chocolate and ending in a characteristic coffee bitterness blended with hops. Chocolate and oatmeal also provide a sweetness and softness throughout. Aroma hops (cascade and centinnial) gives the beer a slight touch of freshness without at any time stealing the picture from this full coffee, chocolate and oatmeal breakfast.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"

448,"2007-02-18",4.0,"From a 22oz Bottle.  Opaque, murky black chocolate pour with a creamy layer of quickly dissipating lightly roasted tan head.  Loads of silky roasted coffee in the aroma that blends eloquently with shavings of dry bakers chocolate and toasted walnuts.  Great name, I want my morning cup of coffee to smell like this.  Nice aromatic balance between the chocolate, roast coffee, nutty, and caramel tones.  Each layer is carefully layered to prevent any single aspect from becoming too dominant.  Medium bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel.  Lots of dry chocolate and medium roast coffee initially invade my welcoming palate.  Some interesting coconut husk characters seem to be working a bit of a lighter, softer dimension onto the palate without giving up any of the bitter roast character.  A bit of toasted hazelnut lingers on the palate in the final smack along with more coffee beans.  I like how the edginess of the roast flavors is kept in check on the palate by the softness of the subtle toasted oatmeal in the mouthfeel.  Thanks, Jake!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Lots of expresso coffe bean in the flavour, which leaves an extremely bitter, burnt smoke and dry, dusty aftertaste. Not as sweet and gentle as, say, the Oak Aged Yeti, but a more menacing stout that tastes like one of those tiny cups of explosive coffee you get in an Italian cafe - with 7.5% of alcohol cleverly and quietly slipped in to it.","Umeå, SWEDEN","lagomswedish"

Aromas initially dominated by hopps but then roasted malts take over, but still this note of hopps lies beneath, which may be the reason why a person like me, who normally don´t like stouts can find a lot of interesting stuff in this beer.

Taste dominated by roasted malts with vague hints of hopps. And after a while the coffee becomes noteable. good and long finish. 

A very complex beer, but for breakfast ? 

By my opinion 66 cl is too much. The finish gets too dominating and after a while tasting gets impossible. I don´t find it harmonic, a little too much of everything and not so well balanced.

I get notes of bitter chocolate and coffe, and the sensation is so very balanced, that I even before I taste it know, that Im not going to share this one with anyone.... The flavour - Mamma mia.... I think this must be the best stout I ever sank my greedy teeth into, its thick and lovely - ready to be eaten with its notes of porridge and coffee with a hint of chocolate. The coffee flavour is simply wonderful and the oats gives a smooth and soft counterweight, and the balance is unique.

What did stand out, instead, was ease of drinkability, a Mikkeller strong suit. Poured dark black with a substantial and compacted dark tan cap. Soft aroma of brewing coffee, light chocolate, even lighter raspberries and oatmeal. Palate is soft and medium bodied. More coffee and chocolate bitterness in the initial taste. Very easy to drink, surprising how quaffable and light this goes down. Very complex, quite tasty, but nothing stands out besides the drinkability.

448,"2006-11-08",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 5, 2010 Bottled at Horsens Beerfestival. Jet black with a small, dense, brown head. Chocolate, mocha, roased/burnt malt, coffee and lots of citrusy and piney hops in the aroma. The flavor is much the same delight, but feels a bit more pronounced. Fullbodied, with a long coffee-bitter and burnt finish. A balanced, yet hoppy beer. A bit too much for breakfast maybe, but delightful. Rating: 8-4-8-5-17-4.2. 061028Bottle. Theres some brownish notes in this black beer. The head is tan and of moderate size, leaving lacings. Theres loads of freshly brewed black coffee on the nose, roasted and chocolatey, and with a lovely hoppyness giving some citrus and pine cones. The flavor is sweet with an underlying roasted bitterness. Black coffee, smooth heavily roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate and a fine citrusy, piney hop impact that leads my thoughts to a newly opened bag of hops. No molasses or dark sugars, no dried fruits. Still, its damn fantastic with all its complexity in a simple way. Can I write that? I mean, simple and complex in the same sentence. It might be a bit thin on the palate, but its damn smooth, quite dry and it slides down dangerously easy. And as it warms up a bit, everything is lifted up to an even higher level. Theres some alcohol too, all the way from the nose til after the last swallow, but its just there to compliment the beer, it adds to the complexity and is just pleasant, almost relaxing. Nothing like the boozy alcohol found in strong euro-lagers, just a smooth, sneaking touch of warmth that suits this dark, rainy day very well. And the finish, it just dont disappear. The coffee and dark chocolate just lasts and last, I had to drink some water to get rid of it. Well, I didnt want that, so I had another sip and quit drinking the water. Oh, what a lovely beer, Ill definitely have one with breakfast this weekend. I dont drink coffee, except when Mikkeller and other brewers put it in their beers, so a bacon, toast, marmalade, butter, milk and BGB breakfast will probably kickstart the day in wonderful way. I might even make some scrambled eggs and have some smoked salmon with it. Im hungry already! The last ten or twenty or so BGBs Ive had has sort of disappointed, probably due to the wonderfullness of its bigger brother Beer Geek Brunch Weasel. This BGB was the best Ive ever had, it stood out even though it was drank after two lovely porters at the same ABV level. The combo of dry, roasted malts and coffee and hops did it for me. Damn, Im glad I didnt just bring one bottle home. Cheers! 101005","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
448,"2006-11-08",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 23, 2007 Pours thick jet black with a creamy brown head, brilliant lace and retention. Aroma is very strong, of freshly ground coffee, caramel, fuggles hops and cocoa. As I sipped through the head, there seemed to be small chunks of coffee coming through, interesting but not all that nice... probably my biggest problem with the beer. Otherwise, it has a thick creamy feel in the mouth... Flavours of coffee, chicory, earthy hops, vegemite... its also very bitter from the hops, coffee and malts. The finish is long and bitter, roasty and warming. Great balance, amazing beer. In recent bottles Ive bought, the roastiness and hops seems flatter, and not as enjoyable.

Neither chewy nor oily nor creamy nor tart...I think the word solid best describes the body.  Its built like a brick shithouse.    The flavours start with an interplay between sweet & dark chocolate malts and insistent espresso roast.  There is a solid hoppy base for this intense, if simple, palate.  The finish is big with lingering roast, pungent alcohol and burnt fruitcake.  As it warms, it gets rather oaty (though not as fatty as most big oatmeal beers) and gains in milk chocolate character, which helps temper the intensity of the bitterness.  Well-made, rather interesting brew, especially considering the cliched concept.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

448,"2006-06-25",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 21, 2006 October 2005 bottle from Engelsmann shared with SuIIy May 2006Bountiful, dark olivine-tinged coal-black body supports a ash-rubbed dark sienna brown head.  Nearly immovable and fills the sides of the glass with sticky lace.  Plenty of sediment lies undisturbed at the bottom of the bottle.The nose is packed with rich, sweet toffee-like malt notes that mix with a strong milk chocolate (also sweet) before becoming lightly fruity (almost a roasted barley vinousness) and finally dried out by coffee (black, rich, french roast-like coffee notes).  Sweet, creamy, vanilla-like sugars seem to crowd the very beginning of the aroma and the transition from start to finish is very abrupt and shocking to my nose.  With extended warming and breathing, I get a trace of alcohol in the nose, on the very end, mixed in with the bitter black notes and roast.Sweet chocolate, tempered lightly by poigant roasted notes (dried figs, coffee beans, salty toffee) builds up quickly, and through the middle the creamy sweet caramel, chocolate and vanilla-cream sugars really hang on the palate.  But everything is blown away by the massively bitter, acidic and darkly malted finish, laden with both hop acids and black coffee notes.The carbonation was a touch too loose, or perhaps I just drank it too warm?  Odd because its naturally carbonated and formed a wonderful head (maybe more an influence from the oats?).  But residual sugars seemed to create a heaviness on the mouth, nearly syrupy with, perhaps, an oat-like gelatinousness? (though not cloying).  I love an unfiltered texture and a thick, rich body, but things just seemed a little too loose for all of the rich flavors.  I also was a little turned off by how powerful and forceful the flavors were.  It moves from very sweet to very bitter quickly.  Quite extreme, too much so for me, but certainly a well-made beer.  Id love to try another bottle (and hopefully will soon).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Aroma is big with quality roasted coffee and roasted malts. Hints of darker fruits and even a tinge of blueberry are also present. After this a lighter wave of dark chocolate follows. Quite a range of aromas here. Excellent smell that is made unique by that mild fruit/blueberry accent. Body is very slightly brown tinted black and the head is a full three fingers thick, creamy and bubbly, mocha affair that is quite lasting. Fore is tart and acidic then strongly bitter with a blast of coffee. That fruity sweetness from the aroma appears in the middle, but it is more sugar sweet than blueberry/fruit sweet. The coffee notes dominate and while this has a certain smoothness it doesnt immediately strike me as an oatmeal beer. The finish is a blast of dark chocolate and VERY bitter strong dark cofffee. I dont want to say it is a let down because it is a fine beer, but the overall package wasnt as sublime as I anticipated.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"

Ive rated this beer twice in my little black book  first rating was the last rating in a long line of ratings in one evening and Im still not sure as to what I wroteI ended up describing the palate as smooth-smooth. Guess thats velvet in wino-language? Second time I rated this resulted in a more readable handwriting: This beer is pitch black! In Vendelbomål (dialect in the northern part of Jutland) it would be swått. Head was like whipped chocolate  brown and delicious! Aroma of licorice, hops and treats! Yup, I was drivelling in pure expectation, knowing already what was in store for me. Taste is hoppy as Heaven, licorice as Paradise and palate is velvet as The Garden of Eden!

448,"2006-04-30",3.9,"Bottle provided by Mads Berg and shared with the crew at the Hampton Inn Friday night tasting: Nearly opaque with reddish highlights topped by a small frothy tan head and some lace. The aroma has coffee (duh), oats (duh), roasted and burnt malt, grassy hops, clove, white pepper, non-aromatic pipe tobacco, and hint of prune.  The taste starts with a balance of smoky and mocha malt with a hoppy bitterness. Undertones of walnut, oatmeal, and pine as well. The finish has a lot of coffee but it seems in check all told. The feel is lively and sharp, a tad thin for the oats added, some mineral component as well.  Darn good, really balanced till the finish and enjoyable. If the palate was a bit thicker, it would a 4+ beer for me.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
448,"2006-04-30",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2007 Bottle:  Another rarity courtesy of BBB63 at the Hampton Inn Tasting (Friday).  Also received a bottle from Secret Santa (July 07).  Aroma has lots of black licorice, chocolate, and the slightest hints of vanilla.  It pours black with a moderate brown head that lasts a minute or so.  The flavor starts with a quick dose of black licorice that is instantly followed by moderate chocolate and very faint vanilla.  The finish has moderate amounts of black coffee with some bitter burnt notes.  The mouthfeel is slick and slightly oily.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
448,"2006-04-28",4.4,"Dense black, thick creamy dark tan head.  No doubt this would be prefect for breakfast.  Rich nose of cocoa and toasted vanilla beans, soft espresso roast coffee, and hints of berry.  Flavor jumps out with Starbucks type espresso (burnt), more cocoa, touches of caramel and toast.  This gets a nice semi-bitter hop finish that keeps that crazy malt bill well in check.  Full bodied, super-soft carbonation, ultra creamy, bitter-sweet finish.  Best oatmeal stout I ever tried.  Straight up fantastic...","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
448,"2006-04-26",4.2,"Deep, opaque void with an enormous, persistent cocoa-colored head.  What an aromatic nose: cocoa, coffee, caramel, maple, piney hops, burnt grains, oily nuts, ash and probably a little molasses.  The body is thick and creamy, chuck full of soft, velvety carbonation.  The flavor doesnt seem huge due to the fact I usually drink Imperial Stouts when drinking stout, but its got plenty of flavor and has tons of balance.  The roasted malts and burnt coffee are wonderful with the piney hops and moderately sweet residual sugars.  The piney hop kick at the end adds some bitterness, but not quite enough to handle the intense sweetness.  This is a hell of a beer and just as good, if not better, than the Founders offering of the same ilk.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

Heavy force on the palate produces enough love to be considered a morning romance and get me out the door in the morning with an endless smile across my face.  Burnt oatmeal and broiled milk chocolate, left together and untended for two minutes too long, and theres no shying away from the flame.

Absolute darkness, with a near-perfect mocha head.  Call me mister bleak, but I just love the look of a good stout.
A very bold mixture of coffee and hops that dance along my nostril cavities, each taking the lead for a while then leaving the other in charge to do his thing.  Coffee smelled freshly torrefied with no acrid features, yet the hops were youthfull and green, sometimes piney, sometimes more citrucy with orange notes, and it works.
Malt profile is rich, roasted with plenty of dark high-cocoa content chocolate, and again the hops really make their presence known without messing things up.  I wouldnt have thought this mix would work, but then again I know tons of people who go for the one-two punch of a tall glass of OJ with an expresso chaser in the morning.  Kudos to the brewer who had the balls to give this a shot, make it turn out great, and name it with a friendly wink to his niche clientele.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"

Not the blackest, the highest in alcohol or the most powerfull of stouts, Bud IMO the best, most elegant and most complex one i ever had. Taste is soft, smooth, very long and perfectly balanced. When you say chocolat, it has impressions of the best of chocolats. When you say coffee, it is the best fresh torrified coffee you can fiend. The mouthfeel is sliky, very vanilla like, has a fine round body, of burned malts, honey, burned breadcrust and sugar bud also has a complex bitterness of hops and wild spring flowers.

448,"2006-02-27",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 2, 2014 Any first impressions?
-A fine cloth of foam lingers atop the near opaque darkness.
-Citrusy hops coexist in grateful harmony with the roasted coffee beans, married by a high chocolate priestess.
-Coffee beans and 90% dark chocolate blend admirably well.
-Dry roastiness reigns supreme in the 07 version.
-The relatively low carbonation suits the silky body perfectly, making it very drinkable while showcasing its wealth.

What if you dig deeper?
-Resinous, wooden hop bitterness subtly surfaces, adding complexity and diversity to this already unique creation.
-Raisins and vanilla dwell within the coffee.
-This isnt just another coffee stout, but rather a creative twist on oatmeal stouts, and a beautifully crafted one at that.
-Another stellar performance from a brewery I would definitely encourage often if I had the opportunity of sampling them more easily.
-The 07 might be a little thinner than the 06?
-At 2 years old, the 06 is still very drinkable but has definitely lost some of its vigor and complexity.

On the palate it is medium- to fullbodied, soft and with roasted notes of espresso coffee, grilled beef, smoke and some hoppiness in the background.

Were first greeted by a wave of massive roastiness, complemented by intensely aromatic hops. The inherent bitterness will later be a joint effort of those two forces and floor me by its realisation without any acidity, a stunning achievement for one so hoppy. So back to the nose, liquorice, ink, cocoa and earthy roastiness will blend with the vegetal, floral and eminently citrusy hops (even more in flavour) in what remains strikingly balanced. More orange and even more flowers burst upon the mouth entrance. Enormous amount of dark malts cant help, but create its renowned coffee leanings, ashey, balanced with the grapefruit by a process that escapes my preferences preconceptions, all dimensions working toward a common goal, independence of the flavour component being an alien concept turned to ridicule.

448,"2006-01-04",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2006 Shared a bottle with Jacob for breakfast... at 2 pm. Loads of coffee and cold fresh brewed espresso, slight sweetness, with hints of cocoa and milk chocolate. Jet black body with a dark tan head. Dryish and very roasty flavor, with some strong coffee notes. Very smooth mouthfeel and extremely drinkable.","Flagstaff, Arizona, USA","Dixen"
448,"2005-12-31",4.1,"Bottled. I had this as breakfast this morning. Black coloured with a brown head. Loads of coffee and roastiness in the aroma. Notes of hops and cocoa beans. Some sweetness in the flavour. Very dry, roasty and bitter. Coffee, very dark chocolate and hops all around. Soft mouthfeel. Medium to full bodied. Lingering hop bitter finish with some strong coffee sharpness. Very good.","København, DENMARK","Hildigöltur"
448,"2005-12-29",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2005 A pitch black beer with a huge dark brown head. The aroma is complex - quite sweet with dominating notes of dark chocolate and coffee, but also notes that reminds me of milk chocolate and oatmeal. The flavor is sweet, but not too much, with a complex palate of roasted malt, oatmeal, dark chocolate, as well as some coffee. The mouthfeel is fantastically smooth, and the aftertaste is sweet with a slight hint of the acidity like in a cup of coffee, combined with a slight bite from the alcohol - and it lingers for a long time. The aftertaste reminds me a great deal of drinking a great coffee.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"

448,"2005-12-22",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 21, 2006 50 cl. bottle.
Great classic stout aroma with a bit more coffee than usual. Appearance is just my kind of beer: pitch black with dark-brown foam. Flavor is excellent, again the coffee comes through. Mouthfeel nice and rough (like a good porter). Overall one of the best oat-based stouts Ive had.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Schioth"
448,"2005-12-21",3.8,"(on bottle) Pours a pitch and black beer,thick as oil, no white trim at all. Dark beige, fat head, wich sadly diapears. Very coffeeish aroma, but there IS a fume of grassy hops hovering over it, wich gives balance.. The extreme coffeetaste leaves little room for anything else - just the hard and dry taste of a heavy roasted coffee. The finish goes on for eons; after the cold coffee, there is a lash of 80+ chocolate. The coffeelovers new favorite.","DENMARK","JensenTaster"
