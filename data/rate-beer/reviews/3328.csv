An okay beer on the whole but far from impressive & that was doubly disappointing given the fact it was from the Weihenstephan brewery.

3328,"2016-05-18",4.1,"Bottle code 3056. Pours a hazy gold with a touch of amber. Outstanding head volume, quite outstanding retention and world class lacing.

Light bready nose that has a touch of spice, possibly coriander. Also present in this borderline outstanding nose is a light fruity background, probably pear.

Light medium body that has a light slickness to it. World class carbonation / body balance with a rousing mid-palate effervescent kick and a rollicking finely bubbled prickly finish that showcases the crispness.

The flavor profile is outstanding. Rather intense for the style, rather complex and outstandingly balanced are apt descriptors. Bread, cracker biscuit, subtle caramel, herbal hops and a light fruitiness (pear with a light lemon note) all appear. Bitterness is mild in general, but moderate for the style. This is a refreshingly crisp beer. The finish is a crisp slow fade of the above flavors with a grainy caramel underneath.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"
