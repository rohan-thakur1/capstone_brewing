4170,"2015-01-09",3.8,"Vom Faß in der Schalander-Hausbrauerei, Berlin. - Schwarzbraun mit leichtem Rotton, sahniger beigefarbener Schaum. - In der Nase dunkles Malz, Rosinen und eine kräftige aber elegante Mokka-Note. - Im Antrunk erstaunlich schlank mit kräftiger Kaffeenote, elegant aromatisch bitter durch holzige Hopfenherbe. Erinnerte an ein Stout, obwohl untergärig. Dezente Malzsüße und eine fein spritzige Säure. Für einen Bock ungewöhnlich schlank aber von kremiger Fülle. Im Abgang mittlere, leicht holzige Hopfenherbe. Längerer, kaffeebitterer Nachtrunk. - Angenehmer, elegant röstmalz-aromatischer Bock mit sehr schönen Kaffeearomen, perfekt ausbalanciert und überhaupt nicht dick. Ausgezeichnet!","Beijing, CHINA","Moravius"

4170,"2011-03-06",3.8,"Draft @ brewpub. Beautiful deep burgundy, a very dark and rich hue. Enticing and the loveliest looking of all the house beers. Lovely malt aroma. Not as fruity as expected but in a good way, more toasty malts, which are similar in character to the house dunkles. Nice carbonation level and quaffable palate. Excellent body. Smooth flavors. Not too much of anything. Finishes dry but has excellent malt flavors. Balanced, great.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
