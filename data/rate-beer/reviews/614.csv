614,"2015-11-22",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2017 Dark black. This tastes exactly like the deScription....cocoa, milky, some vanilla....salt is noticeable, and very peanuty. Its a butterfinger. Thx for the growler of this stuff ibrew2or3! I hope to try this next to a 4 Hands Absence of Light....or better yet, the peanuts make me want this with some pad thai from Pearl Cafe.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","gregwilsonstl"
614,"2015-08-03",3.8,"On draft at GABF 2014. Pours a stout brown with a tan head. Nose is some chocolate, sweet chocolate, salt, nougat, and vanilla. Flavor is similar with lots of chocolate, salt, nougat, and some caramel. Light in body and a nice sweet stout overall.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
614,"2015-05-08",3.8,"Growler. Deep black hue, chocolate milk-like. One finger of dense tan head fizzles away quickly, leaving behind an oil-slick top layer I assume is from the peanuts. Smells like a baby Ruth: fresh, unroasted peanuts, honey, nougat, milk chocolate. A little lactose, too. The flavor copies the nose with a soft blend of peanuts, chocolate, bitter roast and sourdough before a soft honey finish. Earthy English hops flash mid-palate. Medium body, mild carbonation, massaging bubbles. A bit of the peanut oiliness comes through in the mouthfeel and a hint of alcohol arives at the swallow. Mild chocolatey bitterness on the sides of the tongue. Each glass was better than the one before it -- the adjuncts seem to sink to the bottom of the growler. Very drinkable, but the flavors arent as bright and clear as some other reviews had me hoping for.","","PartyFowle"
614,"2015-02-23",3.7,"Thanks to Dakine for sending me a growler. A dark pour with a tan head. Aroma is peanuts, chocolate and sweetness. Taste is cocoa nibs, peanuts, some salt. Slight snickers bar flavor in the finish. Real tasty overall. So-so lacing.","Granville, Illinois, USA","GranvilleTim"
614,"2014-11-12",3.8,"Growler courtesy of BOLTZ7555, thanks J! Pours a semi-transparent black, with dark brown hues. A small mocha colored head that fades to a ring. Aromas of salty peanuts, light cocoa and a light vanilla and nougat. I imagine a Snickers bar. Taste is a nice balance of the cocoa and vanilla sweetness alongside the roasted nuttiness of the peanuts. Its just much thinner than I was hoping for. Its a good sweet stout but lacks some depth according to my palate. Kind of fades a bit in the finish.","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"
614,"2014-11-07",3.2,"Growler... Pours dark brown with a small, creamy, beige head. The faint aroma offers roasted peanuts accompanied by a watery, chocolate nuance. Medium-bodied with a thin mouthfeel and tingly carbonation. The flavor is sweet and roasty, but mirrors the nose with watery notes of chocolate and peanuts. Minerals in the finish. Its tasty, but thin. Im probably just spoiled by the excellence of Funky Buddhas and Cigar Citys boutique beers. Big thanks to daknole for sending this fresh growler my way!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
614,"2014-10-16",3.9,"Sampled at GABF 2014. Pours a deep black body. Aroma is dark chocolate, cocoa nibs and peanuts. Mouthfeel is medium to soft - light actually, with notes of chocolate covered peanuts, fudge, cocoa, soft vanilla and more nut character. Really nice.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
614,"2014-10-12",3.8,"GABF 2014 Rating (Denver, CO). Pours a nice darker blackish hue, good opaque body with just a gentle brownish glow on the edges. Firmer head atop stays frothy, light brown with good stick around, lacing. Aromas are nice and toasty, firmer chocolate elements and cocoa meet gentle vanilla, a touch of earthiness, nutty, toasty with biscuits. Bigger nose greets and pleases. Initial is medium bodied, a nice airy quality to the body makes this one go down easy. A bit creamy and chocolate driven as we enter, some fudge, cocoa nibs hit with gentle roast, nuts and earth coming on. A faint coffee waft, more chocolate, gentle vanilla and nougat. Airy, light and pretty crushable, this one packs on the flavor well without overburdening the palate with sticky or firm cloying body. Backend is dry, a bit toasty with some cleaner toast and roast, gentle dollop of sweetness. Pretty solid stuff here. Glad I finally got to try it. Flavors and palate and how they work together really is what makes this beer neate.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
614,"2014-08-20",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2014 Smells like a standard stout. Tastes like a pretty solid stout as well except for notes of peanut and chocolate in the aftertaste that are pretty nice. Body is medium and smooth.  I?ll happily order this one any time I see it available.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
614,"2013-11-24",4.0,"Growler with big thanks to Dak! My first AZ rate! Pours Coca Cola brown with just a little off white head. Aroma is peanuts, chocolate and caramel. Smells like a snickers tastes. Roasty stout flavors with chocolate and peanut. A bit of smoke in the finish.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
614,"2013-11-23",4.2,"Pours with a deep mahogany body that has amber edges and supports a light tan head of foam. The aroma is pretty big with molasses, vanilla, maybe some maple syrup, toffee, graham cracker and chocolate. There are dark roasted malts that are well off in the background and pretty well covered up by all the sweetness. The taste starts with a sweet mix of vanilla, molasses and then malt sweetened chocolate goodness. To midway some dark roasted malts and toffee drizzled dark toasted bread peak out amid a sea of various slick sweetness. Yummy.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
614,"2013-11-22",3.6,"Multiple pours at GABF. Pours a black color with tan head. Roasty, chocolate, peanuts, and caramel flavors. I was a bit skeptical about this beer, but it was pretty good; pretty good but not exceptional.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","jcnielsen"
614,"2013-11-16",4.1,"On tap @ Fate. Pours deep black with a tan mocha head. Aroma is peanuts, chocolate, cream, caramel and faint roasty smoked coffee.

614,"2013-11-15",2.3,"Multiple pours sampled at GABF2013. Pours black with a tan head. Oddly generic sweet aroma with a touch of saltiness. Some cheap milk chocolate notes. You know, the waxy kind you get at a gas station. Flavor is very sweet with mild roast and some salt. Very, very sweet. Medium bodied. This is just messy and not that good. Probably the worst example of hype Ive ever seen. This is barely mediocre.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
614,"2013-11-09",4.0,"On tap: The aroma consists of milk chocolate, peanuts, and light vanilla. Its a dark brown, virtually black, with a one finger creamy (nitro) head with good retention. Theres some sporadic webbing left on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with moderate milk chocolate and light vanilla. The finish has light-moderate peanuts with just a touch of salt. Its medium bodied with soft carbonation and mouthfeel. Overall, really tasty...Sweet without being too sweet.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
614,"2013-10-30",4.6,"Tapped again this past weekend for their Halloween party. Pour is black, taste is a great mix of sweet and salty. Ideal combo of chocolate, vanilla with a peanut butter undertone. Not too sweet.","","Kondominium"
614,"2013-10-19",2.9,"Pours a dark brown, thin and watery. Some chocolate in the nose. The taste has some chocolate with a faint saltiness. Dont really get any vanilla. Overall its tastes like an old candy bar that has been sitting on the shelf at a Walmart.","Port St. Lucie, Florida, USA","biggsbowler"
614,"2013-10-19",4.0,"Multiple pours at GABF. Pour is pitch black with a small tan head and good lacing. Big nutty and cocoa aroma - lighter notes of sweet peanut butter, coconut, coffee, and roast. Taste is chocolate peanut butter cups, heavy nutty, vanilla, espresso, a hint of wood and honey. So Delicious. Full mouthfeel with soft carbonation. Love the body on this beer and the sessionability. May be a little too sweet but really tasty stuff.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
614,"2013-10-17",3.5,"Sampled at GABF. Pours an inky black with some tan head. Nose of milk chocolate, nuts, malt, molasses. Smells like a melting Snickers. Tastes like a Snickers; chocolate, peanut, malt, caramel. Sweet finish. Good, but definitely a gimmick.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
614,"2013-10-15",3.6,"GABF 2013. Pours a fairly clear orangish brown appearance with a brown head. Aroma was full of peanut shells and milk chocolate which I guess could be construed as a Reeses Peanut Butter Cup. A touch thin body. Creamy chocolate, caramel, a touch salty, slightly roasty, a touch smoky, peanut butter flavor. Kind of a fun beer to drink - I got a ton of samples - but I wasnt overly impressed. The Fate booth certainly wasnt overly busy Thursday night (it was one of my first stops), but they were out of this beer later Thursday and most of (or all of) Friday. Glad to finally have tried it, but it doesnt blow my mind like some of the local ratings would have led me to believe.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
614,"2013-10-15",3.4,"Draft @ GABF. Pours a deep cola color; light-tan head with solid lacing. Loads of Snickers-like sweetness along with a bit of lightly green coffee in the nose. Green coffee leads in the mouth as well, with cola and heavy milk chocolate; a lot going on here, in terms of salinity and caramel and nuttiness, but it doesnt fit together into a seamless package; generous but messy.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
614,"2013-10-14",3.9,"On tap @ GABF. Black pour with a khaki head. Coconut, peanut butter, and roast on the nose. Coffee, dark chocolate, and some caramel. A touch of ash. Flavor is big on the peanut butter. Some coconut, caramel, and coffee. Dark chocolate, some bitter roast, and vanilla. A touch too bitter. Otherwise, good.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
614,"2013-10-12",2.5,"Draft at GABF 2013, two samples. Rating for Joet. Peanut and dog food malt with some dirty yeast notes (dish rag, mold, earthy soil, metal). Semi-sweet, seemingly full body for its size. Nutty, oily and dirty flavor with some earthy soil and skin sweat. Its also chalky and the malt seems husky too, though not enough to make it too rough. Vanilla doesnt come through.  Noticeable acid with leafy green hop bitterness. Also some chemicals and plastic notes. So how about this, huh? Maybe this was a yeasty sample and that accounts for the dirtiness. I get what theyre going for, Ive had a few similar products and even had another peanut / chocolate stout the same day and the resemblance in the nose was better, I would have given this other beer a 7 on nose, so Im not just hating on the peanut butter and chocolate bar angle.  My friend sampled this as well and she is not familiar with the brewery or the reputation of the beer, and she also said she would score it 2.5/5.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
614,"2013-10-11",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2014 Draft at GABF. Pours black with tan head. Nose and taste of roasted peanuts, vanilla bean, honey, roast chocolate and light milk sugar. Medium body.",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
614,"2013-10-10",4.5,"Tap at GABF. Thanks for the heads up about this one. Pours jet black. Sweet nose, lactose and chocolate. Very sweet mouth, chocolate, caramel, and a hint of nuttiness. Very smooth and balanced. An absolute joy.","Lakewood, Colorado, USA","theothermatt"
614,"2013-10-04",4.3,"Bomber with huge thanks and 1 million beer karma points to Daknole! Pours black with a small brown creamy head that dissipates slowly and laces well. Aroma is roasty, cocoa, peanut. Flavor is chocolatey, roasty, some peanut. Surprisingly light on the sweetness given the name, with a nice bitterness from the roasted malts. Medium body, very creamy lactic mouthfeel. This beer wont change the world, but I am guessing it is my new favorite non-imperial stout. Very very well done Fate!","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
614,"2013-09-30",4.2,"Tastes almost identical to a snickers bar. Chocolate, peanuts, and caramel are the dominant flavors. A bit thin and watery on the back end but if you make this beer imperial it will crush the world.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
614,"2013-09-30",4.0,"22oz capped bomber. Dark brown pour with a kaki head. Roasted malt and nut aromas. Roasted malts and peanut highlights. Some bitterness, but I think more from the malts than the hops. Solid body considering this is a stout, not an imperial stout. Solid mouthfeel. Im not really picking up the vanilla or lactose. It does have undercurrents of bakers chocolate though. Good balance. I suspect that on nitro, as I understand it was originally served, it would be much more creamy and chocolatey. In addition, it might tone down the tang a bit. Might need to book a flight to sample it in person that way. A big thank you to Dak and the brewer for sending a new sample of this to the Florida crew.......","Florida, USA","50belair"
614,"2013-09-21",4.4,"Wow; nice; truth in advertising! Fate's candy bar (milk) stout is just that! Good milk stout base, and the dairy comes through! Sweet, but not too sweet. Some chocolate, some vanilla, can't say I taste peanuts. Very good and very fun. Non roasty. Non complex. Just fun. Would love to see an imperial version! Solid A!

614,"2013-09-20",3.8,"32 oz. mini growler from Daknole. Thanks man! It pours a nice dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma has a ton of peanuts with some roasted malt and a little cocoa. It really does smell like a snickers bar. The flavor is more like a regular stout with roasted malt standing out and minor hints of salted peanuts. Not any more chocolaty that a regular stout and Im not picking up any vanilla. The body is a bit on the thin side for this kind of beer, but then again this isnt an imperial maybe it should be. All in all, its well made and satisfying and even though its a wild concept, it manages to be balanced and drinkable.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
614,"2013-09-17",4.5,"Had this a number of times, on location w/ and w/o nitro as well as a take home.

614,"2013-09-16",4.7,"Growler from dcschiller. 
Pours jet black with a 1 inch tan head that left a little lacing. Aroma is an incredible mix of roasty malt, chocolate, and nougat. Reminds me of a Snickers bar. Flavor is more rich chocolate, peanuts, and nougat. Absolutely delicious. The only knock I have is the body is a little thin. Otherwise, its a phenomenal beer.","Brownstown, Michigan, USA","rayl101"
614,"2013-09-13",4.3,"Pours dark brown/black with a medium tan head...nice lacing...lively. Aroma has notes of vanilla, chocolate, and just a touch of nuttiness. Flavor has nice roastiness topped with vanilla and dark chocolate...peanut buttery notes creep in as it warms. The mouthfeel is medium and creamy with a roasty dark chocolate finish that hints at distant peanut butter that agian increases as it warms. A damn nice beer but I must say I wish they went with real PB and more of it than the peanuts. But thats just the PB junkie in me.","The dub c, Pennsylvania, USA","reggiedunlop"
614,"2013-09-13",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 16, 2013 Draft at brewpub. Served in a goblet. Pours black with a half Inch of khaki foam. The dominant thing here are be peanuts. Theyre big on the nose and big on the tongue. Im not getting the lactose as much. It finishes fairly clean. It s flavorful and delicious but I think it would have been legendary with more lactose. Of course it tastes a lot better when consumed in conditions that are as close as possible to what the brewer intended.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"

614,"2013-09-02",3.6,"Pint on tap. Black (of course) color, good lacing, medium head. Nutty aroma, strong. Some roasted peanut, a little vanilla, not a lot of caramel, but a bunch of malts, not too sweet. Decent medium aftertaste. Very good rendition of a new popular style: points for originality, craft, style, and palate.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Caytinator"
614,"2013-09-01",3.5,"A bit underwhelmed with this one to be honest. It's good, just not great. I suppose chocolate stouts never have the aroma I want, taste is sweet, but not really as chocolate as I was hoping. I missed it on nitro unfortunately, I'm sure it's leagues better on nitro.

The Fate Chocolate Chili Stout still reigns supreme imo.

614,"2013-09-01",4.2,"Dark mahogany pour bordering ebony with a fluffy latte foam perched on top. Fragrant roasted Planters peanuts, rich Hersheys chocolate, gooey caramel, fresh split vanilla bean, and a touch of honey. Displays a lactic creaminess and the flavor matches the aroma beautifully. This isnt an aggressive brew. The subtleties and balance are what impress me here. Nicely executed and definitely best-in-class!","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"
614,"2013-08-31",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 17, 2014 Growler. Peanut butter and cookie dough come through first on the aroma along with a hint of coffee creamer. Pours a clear dark brown with a thin, khaki head; the beer coats the snifter with a very oily film. First sip features peanuts, nougat, slightly buttery pastry dough, and milk chocolate. Caramel joins the party late with a hint of vanilla, but the peanuts remain the backbone. Medium body with an oily mouthfeel and a sweet, slightly chalky finish. An aptly named stout; if I had to pick out one candy bar that most matches the flavor, Id have to say Baby Ruth with extra peanuts. I need to try it on nitro before passing final judgement, but its definitely one tasty brew.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
