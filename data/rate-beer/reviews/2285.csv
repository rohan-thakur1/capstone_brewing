2285,"2011-02-21",3.4,"750ml bottle from a generous trader.

Pours an opaque mahogany with nary a head to speak of.  There are some big bubbles that fade immediately after a vigorous pour.  No lacing but some boozy legs on the sides.

Aroma is massive, just massive.  Where to start...big sweet malt backbone with lots of candy sugar and dark fruits - figs, raisins, overripe plums.  Throw in a hint of lest her and some substantial oak and alcohol and youve got a stunning nose.

Taste is similar but the sweetness is so thick that it really gets cloying.  Molasses, brown sugar, caramelized fruits, all just coating the mouth completely.  The oak is present but cant find its way though the sweetness much.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with very little carbonation.  Its crazy sweet and cloying on the palate.

Well, the nose on this one is fantastic but the taste and mouthfeel dont quite stack up.  Over the top sweet with low carbonation, this is certainly not the most drinkable beer.  An enjoyable sipper.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
2285,"2011-01-31",2.3,"750mL @Pre-Sex 2011. Poured a hazy, brown amber with white bubbles and no head really forming.

Taste is just 100% bruised red apples so Im guessing some form of acetaldehyde. Drain pour.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

This smelled so complex and incredibly delicious. Taste of raisins, warming alcohol, rum, very sweet, vanilla, pipe tobacco, wood, cinnamon apples, maple, and caramel. The taste was as complex and delicious as ANY beer Ive ever had. The finish was creamy, carbonation was perfect, and the linger is extremely long. Tons of dried fruit flavor. What an AMAZING beer. I finally found one of the 5 island beers. Meaning, if someone asked what would be the 5 beers youd take with you to an island, this would definitely be one of them.

Aroma of brandy, oak, bourbon, raisins, dark fruits, richness, dates, leather, butter, spicy (heavy toasted) wood, currants and mass complexity. I could never imagine that the taste would live up to the aroma, but IT DID! Taste of straight madeira/sherry, rich brandy, toffee, dates, awesomeness, sweetness, richness, oak, vinous.

wet-wine character. Sugary. Alcohol lays down real well and lets a lot of sugar and spice flow forth.

It’s got a cloudy, somewhat dingy body which belies the complexity and vibrancy of the flavors. The base beer is a really well done quad. And if it doesn’t have any specifically distinguishing characteristics other than being top notch, it’s certainly given personality by the barrel aging, which imparts a sweetness that really nicely complements the style. The body might suffer just a tad from age, but this is really well done.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Dried figs. Candi sugar. Not a whole lot of barrel character though. Some vanilla and alcohol. Poura a pretty dark cherrywood with a quickly disappearing khaki head.

The aroma is really nice on this one with the dark fruits and candied sugar blending with sweet caramel and oaky vanilla. Plums, raisins, and figs push through and add depth to the sweet vanilla cream and oak laden flavors. The vanilla seems to soothe over the alcohol with only a hint of it on the back end. Full bodied and thick on the mouthfeel, but very smooth and creamy. This one went down smooth with a sweet vanilla finish. This one made good use of the oak and had a really nice flavor to it.

As soon as I poured this I knew I was in for a long night of drinking... rich mahogany hue with a slight frothy head but more important is the oily film it leaves upon the glass. Massive nose of prune and fig, peat, Belgian candi, vanilla and oak, pipe tobacco, and an slight meaty vapour, I am very interested in what the flavor profile may hold...  First impression of the taste is big sweet malt and over ripened fruits. Very liquor/ vinous approch upfront. Upon further inspection I find mild spicy qualities and a charred oak/peaty undertone. Some yeasty notes and very balanced alcohol upon the finish, The mouth feel is rich an velvety, coats the palate till the alcohol show up.

The aroma is significantly more smooth than the regular version, creamy, oaky vanilla lending a calming influence to the massively sweet candied sugar and dark fruity malts.  Flavors are sweet and malty, fig and raison again showing through prominently, but the vanilla component really draws everything together and seemingly negates the alcoholic burn present in the non-oaked version.  It really works well with the earthy spice notes as well.  Thick and sugary in the mouth, but not stepping too far over the line into cloying territory.  I enjoyed this one quite a bit.  Definitely a top notch Quad.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

2285,"2008-02-07",3.6,"A slightly aggressive pour yields a frothy, initially fat-one-finger thick, amber tinged, tan colored head that sits on top of an amber tinged, very dark brown colored brew.  When held up to the light the beer shows a brilliantly clear, jeweled, ruby color.  The aroma is clearly oak influenced; a bit like Bourbon with aromas of vanilla, soft butterscotch and a finish that has spicy oak notes as well as a bit of boozy alcohol to it.  Competing with the oak character, especially after my nose gets used to it, is noticeable a substantial malt and fermentation character; chewy notes of concentrated plum, brown sugar, toffee and towards the finish notes of toasted biscuits ad whole grain read crust; that last being quite substantial if you dig for it.  The aroma is definitely oak influenced as this is the most dominant note, but I like that you can get a sense of the other components too.

Somewhat thick feeling which nicely complements a sweetness that is not too cloying and seems a bit complex.  By complex I mean the sweetness incorporates flavors of fruit, caramelized sugar, and grain without being simplistically sweet (like table sugar).  The oak character is quite a bit more subdued in the flavor, which is a most welcome surprise, but it is still quite evident, especially towards the finish.  The beer ends with a spicy oak character, some tannic woodiness and some alcohol that combines with the oak to provide a bit of Bourbon character.  Soft vanillin flavors and light buttery oak combine up front with the malt sweetness.  Fruity notes of rum soaked raisins, concentrated plums (but still with some tartness), a touch of fresh jam-like berry notes and even a bit of tart / sweet cherry notes.

At times this beer can taste a bit thin, but a little bit of age should help this out.  Age would also add some aged-malt complexity to this brew that is perhaps a bit too simplistic in that department as it is missing the complexity and heft of the best Quads.  Dont get me wrong though this is quite a nice a beer.  This is one of those brews that proves that at least some American brewers are getting that oak does not have to be overwhelmingly noticeable; oak as only a component of the flavor palette is where it is at.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Retention is strong, and there is some lacing, more a film, left behind as it recedes.A whopper of a nose dictates robust cabernet/syrah (a bad guess, its actually merlot) notes powerfully contrasted with a dry, but very aromatic oakiness.  Chocolate pushes its way forth, sweet and thick, followed by raisins, prunes, orange rinds and medium-sweet vanilla and toffee.  Very high strength of aroma, with some light alcohol suggestions, though fairly under control in that department.Thick and chewy in the mouth, the palate is initially bombarded with strong oak flavors (though not too heavy on the tannins) and moderately acidic red wine notes.  Punchy and tart, it is matched well to the sweet chocolate and strong yeast esters.  The usual suspects: prunes, raisins, figs and vanilla, are of course present, helping to dry the finish, with aid of some alcohol.  Certainly not moderately done is the barrel-aging, despite the fact that the flavors are enjoyable.  But theyre just too much.  Belgian character is noticeable, though generally reserved.  Mostly esterized alcohol and yellow and dark fruit esters.  Light clove phenols, as well as a fair dose of acidity.  Attenuation seems pretty appropriate, though I always seem to prefer things more dry than most people.  Thick, borderline syrupy texture with low, but fairly tight carbonation.  I dont consider myself a good judge of this style, so my review should be taken with a grain of salt.  I do know that if they took it out of the barrel sooner, it would be a real treat.And as a sidenote, it was delicious with a cigar, which helped dry it out further and combat the barrel aging influence.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
