3266,"2014-04-07",3.6,"August 17th, 2012 - Midnight Sun Brewing Companys lasciviously named Panty Peeler might be the ""beer of trip"" up to Alaska. We picked it up in a small liquor store somewhere in Sitka, mostly on a lark. As tourists are ""curio lust"" was in full swing - our instincts demanded we by some kind of tasteless crap to commemorate the adventure to the tamest part of the untamed Alaskan wilderness. For me, the Panty Peeler fit the bill perfectly. The label and name were worth a boyish chortle and a guffaw, and it promised to be more enjoyable than a t-shirt covered in crude innuendo and half-hearted sexual puns. But the real treat was that the beer inside wasnt merely satisfactory, or even good. It was EXCELLENT. The nose has a twangy, funky fresh banana note, coupled with e Brettanomyces twang that resonates like a loud, plucked banjo string in a silent room. Clove creeps into the nose as well, though it trips itself up as it immerses deeper into the yeasty funk of this brews bouquet. On the tongue this beer is predominantly sudsy, and maybe even excessively so, but eventually the flavor musters the courage to step forward and express itself. When it does, theres lots of light orange and lemon flavors, decorated with a cherry sweetness, and the light tart tang of meringue. The body is light (reasonably so), demonstrating a good balance between mouthfeel and flavors. With a little time and patience, the carbonation is tempered, revealing a delicately balanced brew that once again shows off Alaskan proficiency in lighter brews.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Pours a beautiful hazed orange color with a cantalope melon hue. Just wonderful to look at. Not a whole lot of lace from my lazy pour and it fell fast to a thin ring. Nose is vivacious and has plenty of exotic tropical fruit. Sweet and juicy. Theres a touch of malt that hints at bread and offers just a light sweetness on the nose. No alcohol on the nose, but a nice bit of earthy coriander. The scent of orange is deep within the beer and is an all around orange fruitiness. 

Taste is wonderful. This beer offers a tremendous fruit sweetness with lush and heady tropical fruits and an all around orange flavor too. The malt suggests bread but does not become too heavy or too bready. Wonderful mouthfeel on this that is due to that malt. The coriander is earthy and lends a depth. There is a nice yeast dryness that takes the mid palate just as you are begining to swoon from all that wild tropical flavor. Then it finishes with a sweet and warming alcohol that has a spice and pepper of its own. A lingering fruity aftertaste.

This beer is a delight!","New York, USA","pinkie"

Taste is ripe bananas, excessive spiciness, yeast, strong medicinal notes, cake malts, dry apples.  This beer wasnt fun at all.  This is not the only disappointing Midnight Sun beer weve had lately.  It seems that the once wonderful Midnight Sun brewery may not be quite so wonderful anymore since the departure of their head-brewer in late 2010.  Or maybe it is just a bad coincidence.

The flavor shows most of the same components but is a bit odd.  Barnyard and straw notes are added with a good dose of orange peel, coriander, and Belgian yeasty flavors.  Fortunately, theres not a lot of alcoholic tang that sometimes (for me) is the downfall of the style.  In short, its pretty drinkable stuff.

Friggin solid beer. The best American Tripel? Quite possibly. Gorgeous thick full mouthfeel never approaches sticky. Carbonation is quite modest, but for this particular beer it works very well.

3266,"2010-06-17",3.5,"22oz bomber, bottled the second week of March, say the notches.  Bought from Healthy Spirits for like $12-13 or so.  Clear medium orange with a small yellowish white head, fair retention.  Belgian yeast up front with some citrus notes and spicy coriander and peppery notes behind.  Flavor is much doughier and actually almost buttery, though maybe I think Im getting the tiniest bit of leathery brett, so maybe thats the buttery thing thats going on.  Stronger orange notes and stronger coriander than the nose.  Finishes with some alcohol, dry, bitterness at a 3.  High carbonation with a medium body.  Not overly impressed, but not bad at all.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

3266,"2010-04-26",4.3,"Panty Peeler label

22 oz bottle poured into a large snifter.

A- Body is a thick, uniformly cloudy straw yellow hue. Pours with a soapy 2-3 finger frothing white head. Head has good retention once in fades to the 1 finger mark. Some small traces of lacing are left down the glass.

S- Floral hops, pale fruits, and phenols mix for the nose. The nose is slightly above average and the components do not blend as they should.

T- Apple and pear come through the most for the initial flavor and have both mild sweet and tart components while the backbone is a substantial spicy, sweet bready yeast flavor. Soft floral and noble hops come through for the finish and balance this brew out with a slight bitter and herbal component...the finish is mostly dry but a slight alcohol heat does come through.

P- a medium amount of soft carbonation and a light to moderate weight body that is very smooth secondary to the bready yeast.

O-This is a wonderful American brewed Belgian Tripel. It really hits all the necessary components of the style. The overall character is soft, smooth, and silky- but never thin or boring. The ABV is well hidden except in the nose. I would love to have this again and really wish this brewery were available in Pittsburgh.

The flavor was medium sweet but too much for me.  It’s not cloying or unpleasant, but the sweetness makes the beer feel simpler/shallower than it might otherwise.

6/18/2009:  The aroma of Midnight Sun Panty Peeler Belgian-Style Tripel is laden with heavy malt, orange citurs, hints of smoke and some really strange deli meat characteristic.  The flavor is also quite malty (chewy wheat) and moderately sweet.  It also has dried orange/grapefruit/apricot flavors that are reserved.  There is a hint of alcohol in the nose and a soft spiciness in the finish.  This beer has a deep marigold color and is cloudy with a foamy beige head that falls and remains a frothy crown.  In addition, the its body is medium-full and the beer has an average mouthfeel.  Overall this is not my taste for this style of beer!

Aroma is sweet notes of orange, banana, spices and yeast. Flavor delivers on what the aroma promised, spices, orange, mango and a touch of yeast. I realize they call this a triple, but with the curacao and coriander, this could easily pass for an Imperial Wit or a Triple Wit (too bad these styles dont exsist !)

3266,"2008-12-07",3.7,"2007 bomber, aged about one year.  The cloudy, orange-amber body is topped with a massive, frothy column of off white foam.  Displaying excellent retention, the head slowly settles, but not without leaving dense, sticky, cloud-like patches of foam on the glass.  Aromatics include light candy sugar, lemon chiffon, orange peel, and mild coriander.  There is a creaminess that smooths out some of the candy sugar sweetness, which I appreciate, along with a uniquely Belgian, doughy yeast profile.  Flavors, too, show a formidable candied orange and lemon zest element, which works nicely with the creamy, sugary sweetness and delicate, earthy spicing.  Nutmeg also emerges, lending further woodsy bitterness, while peppery, floral hops show strong on the finish.  Substantially bodied, with fizzy, lively carbonation, the sugary profile gets a bit heavy over time, but is sublime in low doses.  I am not a tripel fan, in general, but this one is right up there with the best that any American brewery I have sampled has to offer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

3266,"2008-11-20",3.7,"This one pours a deep golden orange with a fluffy white three-finger head that recedes to an inch-thick cap that lingers throughout. The lacing is very good.

The aroma is a spiced up version of a typical tripel. It has the generous Belgian yeast aroma and slight candied sugar presence. But on top of that I get a healthy dose of citrus hops, lemons and oranges, and coriander.

The taste starts out with the citrus hops, with a hint of lemony tartness in the background. The Belgian yeast is present as well and the finish has a touch of the lemon zest and a generous dose of spices. I also got an interested toasted grain presence throughout which I wasn’t expecting.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of carbonation with a slightly dry, toasty finish.

Sweetness is medium-high and soft. Bitterness is mild, astringency is soft and adequate. The finish is lightly tart and lingering with sweet malts. Soft and medium bodied palate, mild carbonation. A delicious example of a tough style.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Bottled the 2nd week of June according to bottle. 07 Im assuming

Epluche-culotte pours a deep golden with tiny floating particles you really have to look to notice which creates a slightly hazy appearence. Five or six streams of carbonation bubbles race to the surface. A one finger white head formed on the pour that quickly fell to a skim coat with a thicker ring around the glass. Leaves some patchy lacing.

This beer has a really uniue aroma for a tripel, one I wasnt at all expecting but is very welcomed. The aroma is loaded with a berry sweetness. Strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, and (last but most noticeable) blackberry. A mild spicy dose of alcohol compliments the berry medley. Very interesting aroma and something Im very fond of.

Flavor goes hand in hand with the aroma. Berry flavors abound. Blackberry kicks things off along with some mildly sweet raspberries. Strawberries come along on the finish with an appropriate pale/biscuity maltiness thats hardly noticeable but keeps things from being too fruity. 

Medium bodied with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Glides through very smoothly with a pleasant warmth on the swallow from the alcohol. 

I could drink this beer all night until I couldnt drink anymore. With all the berry flavors present I would think it would start to get too sweet but this beer hits the mark just before it turns too sugary.

A great tripel from Midnight Sun. Not at all what I was expecting from a tripel. The fruitiness is there but in a much different form from the fruitiness Im used to seeing in other tripels. Great example!

Again a couple years later:
Pours attractive, though light golden yellow, with abundant white head.  That head is musty funk initially, and then yeasty. Drinks very extreme corriander, orange in finish and aftertaste that is most satisfying.  Above average mouthfeel.

As the beer warms and you get the feel of the taste, different characters emerge - a faint hint of spice, a big buttery presence, and more fruit (even an occasional hint of apple).

3266,"2007-03-24",3.2,"UPDATED: JUN 1, 2008 Wow...I was expected a lot more from this beer. First, it is way too carbonated. I coundt keep it in the glass. Then, it smells just like a Euro Hefe. The flavor is much too sweet, and way to estery. From my way to limited experience with Belgian beer, they are known for their sublty and complexity. This is like getting hit over the head with tutti-fruity Kool-Aid. Im sorry kids, but Im rating to style here. And if you say Belgian Trippel, you better bring your A game. (And actually, I think that this is a witbier).

Medium bodied, prickling carbonated mouthfeel.  Lots of spice.  Flavors of plantain flesh, nutmeg, orange skins, and a touch of coconut husk.

Carbonation bubbles steadily rose to the top of the glass. The aroma stunned me with apples, cherries, and grapes coming through (Is this really a tripel?). The flavor had many of the same elements in the background, but was different. Pineapples were pretty strong with vanilla and honey also in the flavor (some pina-colada type tastes). Not overly sweet like some tripels, and the hop finish was there, but not pronounced. The wheat base was rather hidden.

3266,"2005-10-03",3.4,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2005 Bottled second Week of December, Sampled October 2005
This beer is highly carbonated, it shows no respect and after pouring with a four finger thick, tan head promptly oozes over the top of my glass.  The beer is a hazy orangish light amber color.  The aroma is sharp, spicy and herbal, when I go in for a deeper smell, I get notes of higher alcohols, and what seems like a bit of Brett; lightly musty, horse blanket, and even some barnyard character.  The head on this just won’t quite, I think this might be infected, though if it is it might work with this style of beer.

The taste is spritzy and quite sweet up front with notes of orange peel.  The finish is funky with a cotton mouth quality to it, notes of dandelion, ginger, hint of cardamom, some clove, lemons, ripe cheese, and a musty slightly moldy note.  This beer is quite interesting, I am pretty sure that the Brett character was not intended by the brewer, but, as in the case of Fantome, it works here.  The funky note is in the background, and adds to the complexity of the beer.  Though this is starting to be a pattern with the beers I have had from here recently.

This beer Characterizes the perfection of balance found in the Maitresse du Moines with a subtlety that is downright rare in North American Belgian ales. The dryness found in the aroma is counterbalanced with a wonderfully subtle fruitiness mixed with the Belgian yeast. The yeast here is a little overpowering, but blends in the flavor very well. The flavor is much sweeter than the aroma would indicate, swirling with dried fruit and esters and a dryness reminiscient of a nice merlot. Perhaps the most unique aspect of the beer I found was in the malt which is just awesome, smooth with perfect taffee-esque sweetness. Throughout all of this I found hardly any trace of the high alchohol percentage (I felt it though), it is incorporated seamlessly. The finish is primarily apples, light yeast, and a touch perfumy.

The flavor starts out malty, goes through to a yeasty domination, and finishes long and spicy; all the while sweetness dances in to tango with the other flavor sensations.  The palate is subdued carbonation over a rather smooth body.  Alcohol makes itself known as it warms, but still not offensive.  Overall, very nice!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"

Soft fluffy palate that offers both a delicate, clove/pepper spice at the back of the mouth and luscious fruits to the tongue.

The aroma was, well, odd, strong aged cheddar cheese. Normally this would be a bad sign, but we plunged on anyhow. The flavor was also that of aged cheddar. Given all of this cheese presence you might expect that the beer was terrible, well it was not. It was not great but far from terrible. Body was medium and dry.

3266,"2003-11-24",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2005 2003 bottle sampled 11/20/03 at Sunset Grille.  The entire glass was head at first. Had to wait a while.  Big and white, a very hazy straw yellow. Smells musty, with a hint of citrus (lemon mainly), has some honey in there and a good amount of peppery yeast.  Quite appealing.  Starts out with a light hops bitterness, there is some lemon and biscuit flavor as well.  Tons of malt comes out, hint of banana, good amount of bubble gum and very sweet.  All the while there is an earthy, almost mossy flavor on the back of the palate, almost rusty/coppery.  Medium body with some wateriness. Big sweet fruit esters/malt flavors dominate, but give way towards finish which is slightly watery but also much more crisp.  Lemon, hops, clove and a very nice peppery yeast.  Strangely there is also a sweet vanilla flavor that is unmistakeable.  Fuzzy texture, like angel food cake almost. carbonation is not a problem after it warms.  The beer comes together well, would really like to try again, though I must admit to it being a bit too sweet, would actually appreciate if the alcohol came out more, it is shockingly well hidden.2003 bottle 3/24/05 Downtown Liquors Trippel tasting.  Even after almost two years, this thing still has a good two-finger head, creamy, with great retention.  Not to mention the head has a light beige-yellow color that you do not see in most trippels.  My previous rating is pretty on par with how I felt this time, though I will say that I dont feel it was too sweet.  Lightly creamy, good body, slight notes of perfume with the distinct Belgian yeast lingering in the background.  Very complex, as remembered, with notes of pineapple, lemon, banana, vanilla, angel food cake, and even a musty, earthiness.  Probably a deeper flavor profile, with more sweet caramels, peaches and darker malts than a traditional Belgian Trippel, but when a beer is this flavorful and well-made, Im not one to take off points for going outside of style guidelines.  Quite the contrary, this stuff is fantastic and was probably my favorite trippel at the tasting.  How well it has aged certainly does not hurt my perception either.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

In my opinion, though, you have to ask yourself what kind of tripel you like - spicy or sweet. This is too sweet for my idiosyncratic tastebuds.
