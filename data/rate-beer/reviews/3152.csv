3152,"2012-11-10",4.5,"330ml bottle thanks to Auoracrisis. First off, this beer was fantastic, just wonderful but I am already biased towards the regular biere de mars which we rarely see in Colorado. Dark red with a healthy head at first that died quick. It smelled a lot like the regular version, sour flanders style beer. The taste however had a very pronounced and beautiful oak flavor to it that complemented the beer very well. Sour but full and not so much the lemon flavor I have detected in Biere De Mars. I was actually astonished by how much better it was with the extended oak aging. Fantastic beer.

The beer appears a slightly darker brown than the Biere de Mars, with a bit less head and lace. The aroma is funky, with a strong lactic, acetic presence. It smells similar to Russian River Consecration, which is definitely a good thing. Oak, slight vinegar, tart, Brettanomyces, acetic. Definitely worth a try if you are a fan of funky, sour beers.

My pour is a murky brown color;  the pour is a little darker, fuller, and less transparent than the regular beer.  A small off-white ring forms around the edge of the glass.

The aroma has a bit more vinegar burn than the regular Biere de Mars.  Lemon, 

The flavor is much more sour than the regular Biere de Mars.  The lactic sour notes are still presence, but there is a bit more vinegar sourness.  Lots of lemon steps in the front and really takes the place of the dried dark fruits.  A fit of faded caramel malt is noticeable in the background, but the full, robust sour flavor has really taken over in a delicious way.  

Being more sour than the regular Biere de Mars, it is no surprise that it is more puckering on the palate.  It starts out smooth and a bit sweet, with a lemony sourness that grows, peaks, and levels off  at the end, finishing cleanly.  The body and carbonation are both on the light side of medium.

Biere de Mars is a great beer, and the Grand Reserve improves it nicely.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

But a bit more restrained than I expected. Moderate funky farmyard character on the palate. There was a slightly odd edge that I thought seemed a bit like plastic but it didnt detract too much. Moderate sourness. Sharp mouthfeel. The bourbon aging contributed just a slight accent without overwhelming. Perhaps it smoothed things out a bit too. Good but I was expecting something a bit more extreme.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

Mouthfeel comes from both acetic and lactic sourness. Quite drinkable, although maybe a bit over the top in any relatively large quantity.

Brown pour, modest head despite an aggressive pour. Acetic acid and cherries on the nose, maybe some wood, but a surprisingly hard-to-find bourbon character (it picks up more on the aroma of the empty glass; I think perhaps the acetic acid covers).  Characteristic JP green apples, some cherry, of course very much an acetic Flemish-style sour though not sweet in the least; instead, one gets a mouth-puckering,drying tannin close. The midrange actually recalls Alexander (though perhaps Im just imagining that) in its tannic cherry intensity. Almost none of the caramel and brown sugar that makes the regular Biere de Mars so confusing stylistically. Over all, the beer is very good, but not quite the standout I might have hoped for.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

In short (batch 65 27 months in oak): A sharp, dry, sour, fruity ale with whiskey notes.  Kick-ass
How: Bottles 12oz.  Age unknown.  I drank both versions (16 months in oak & 27 months BA batch 65).  Multiple bottles from multiple sources (toncatcher/Dennis, Solan/Alan, ygtbsm94/Brad, others?).  Thanks to you all.
The look (16 months in oak): Cloudy dark amber ruby topped by a small persistent beige head
The look (batch 65 27 months in oak): Cloudy golden amber body topped by an off-white ring of foam 
In long 16 months in oak:First I was very surprised to notice a lot bourbon in the aroma of the 16 months BA version and very little bourbon in the 27 months BA version.  Go figure.  Nose has roasted wood and bourbon.  Taste is dry roasted malts, roasted wood, backed fruits, some red apples, lots of whiskey barrel, a tiny bit of smoke.  Very dry.  Barely sour, not really funky.  This beer does not resemble the regular JP BDM at all.  Did I get a bad bottle? 
 The look (batch 65 27 months in oak): First I was very surprised to notice a lot bourbon in the aroma of the 16 months BA version and very little bourbon in the 27 months BA version.  Go figure.  Nose has sharp funk.  Taste of 27 months BA is funky, lots of green sour apples, light single malt whisky notes, some vinegar.  Very dry.  The bourbon barrel in this one was really like sour oak and a drop whiskey, not whiskey barrel wood like with the 16 months BA.  The caramel of the regular JP BDM is really town down here.  I really like the regular JP BDM but if I can say one bad thing about it is that the caramel and funky sourness dont really work well together.  This beer is just as sharp, funky and sour as the regular JP BDM except that the caramel is toned down and the added bourbon notes are moderate.  So I found this one better than the regular BDM.
Score for (16 months in oak): 7-3-8-3-15 = 3.6
Score for  (batch 65 27 months in oak): 9-4-8-4-18 = 4.3
In conclusion: The 16 months version couldnt lace up the batch 65 boots.  Well, of course I know a beer doesnt really wear boots.  Its a figure of speech.  However, I like to put my bottles in a thong when I cellar them.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

3152,"2009-07-22",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 30, 2011 16 month bottle thanks to kryptic!Pours a little darker than the original, still semi-transparent mahogany with a beige head, slightly smaller. The bourbon knocks out some of the fruity nose of the regular and creates a creamier, more simple profile, but there is still ample brett influence in lemon, also some light wood and similar spice. The harmony in the brett-bourbon marriage is very impressive and is present in the nose and flavor. Mouth also is a hint sweeter, slightly more vanilla and bourbon to add to the tart notes. Very woody, also some refreshing lemon. Carbonation is lower, which is better given that it doesnt compete with the flavor. Shorter finish due to the lack of the fruit, but definite brett influence here as well. Overall still great, but I think the fruit qualities of the regular are lost here, and unfortunately the beer becomes less interesting as a result. 06/11 - 16 month looks nut brown, frothy small white head, little lacing. Dusty, peppery nose, plum and sugary bourbon, lighter vanilla and oak, bit sawdust and lotion. Flavor really oaky, light sugar and licorice, bit thin and hot. 948416.06/11 - 27month has similar pour as 16mo, white head dies a bit, tepid.

3152,"2008-12-31",4.3,"12 oz. bottle.  Batch 65.  Aged 27 months on oak.  Pours a very lightly hazy, burnt auburn-amber color.  A small, foamy, cream colored head settles to a wispy film with a fat edge.  Minimal, spread out, spotty lacing marks the glass.  The aroma is fantastic.  Sour, lightly pungent, funky wood notes permeate each and every nook and cranny in the nose.  Vanilla and dried out caramel work beautifully with wisps of sour mash bourbon, while tannic apple skins and sweet-tart Calvados elements add fruity depth.  Flavors are vinegary, with a big sour apple component and notes of tannic fruit skins.  Again, massive, funky oak plays a big role, with just a hint of bourbony twang lending some heat.  The finish is semi-dry and quite sour, with green apples lingering for ages.  The palate is substantial and puckering, if not just a shade overly carbonated and dusty towards the back of the throat.  Such a minor flaw can certainly be forgiven in a brew of this caliber.  This was an outstanding choice to ring in the new year.  Easily Jolly Pumpkin’s best beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

3152,"2008-05-31",4.0,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, batch 65.  Misty, rusty orange appearance; a thick web of white foam clinging only to the rim.  Creamy tart oak aroma; vanilla, coconut, peach, cherry.  Light vinegar and balsamic presence; seems potent, but balanced.  Flavor is sharp and sweet, hugely acetic and acidic, just bursting with cranberry acid and fruity vinaigrettes and raw funkiness.  Bourbon seems fairly removed when searching for its signature, while the tempering effect of the sweet oak on this flemish type of violent sourness is much more apparent and appreciable.  Floral honey, distant buttery warmth and vibrant citrus fruit flavors characterize that softening, and a touch of nutty sweetness.  Swallowing precipitates a slow tide of sharp, refined tartness blossoming in the back of the mouth; firey and full, like the best flemish reds with a dry burst of chocolate cherries and dry buttery sweetness.  Wooden palate is full and delicate; very soft and a bit syrupy with mild carbonation.  Finishing flavor of hot lemon juice, drawing out forcefully and smoothly.  The chewiness and general girth here seems less than ideal, but altogether this marriage of sour and bourbon is an amicable one, which is likely to improve and deepen with age.  Thanks Ken!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Some vanilla, some bourbon.  A lot of vinegar... its almost hard to differentiate between the bourbon and vinegar flavors.  I dont know what to say about this because it seems folks have rated it quite highly.  Its not among my favorites, or even among my favorite Jolly Pumpkins.

3152,"2008-05-23",4.3,"Thanks so much to amorphiss for including this as an extra!  12oz, aged in barrels 27 months.  Think this is batch 2.  Pours a muddy, dark reddish brown with a small trace of a white head.  Though the carbonation is apparently scarce it still manages to create decent lacing. Aroma is pretty potent acetic acid, slight vinnegar-like.  Reminds me a lot of a fresh Roja, actually.  Intensely fruity, lots of sour cherries.  Im searching for bourbon and I think I find it, though it certainly is more subdued than imagined, especially after 27 months worth of resting. A little bit of oaky vanilla is detectable underneath there as well. All of the characteristics blend together well, creating a powerful though subtle fusion of pleasant aromas.  Taste is pretty darn tart.  A real nice cherry flavor follows the intitial sour smack that fades into an acidic aftertaste.  A good level of sourness, certainly more than most of JPs brews.  A slight alcohol burn while going down but nothing distracting.  The bourbon isnt overpowering and hardly noticeable honestly.  I am a big fan of Jolly Pumpkin and this is certainly one of their greatest achievements.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

This was from the first batch and had a few years on it.  I needed something good to get out of a funk of predictable and safe beers.  A Grand Reserve release was just the ticket.  I consider this one of the best beers around if you can find any from the last bottling.  If not keeps your eyes open and pick it up when you can.  The sourness only gets better with time.
Aroma / Appearance - The caramelized opaque body suspended a trace of sediment below a sticky eggshell head.  Chocolate, oak and malt formed a very rich set of aromas with the sourness set to medium.  This was not super tart but obviously had a bit of funk to it.
Flavor / Palate - Oaky cola blended with dark truffles formed a very nice desertlike experience.  Chocolate and caramel preceded a carbonated moist aftertaste of plums and cherries.  The mouthfeel was full bodied, rich and complicated.  It was a nice capstone to wrap up a busy day.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3152,"2008-04-14",4.3,"Batch 65; Sampled April 2008
A vigorous pour produces only a half finger thick head that quickly disappears.  The beer is a ruddy, dark cherry color that shows a hazy, cranberry stained, amber color.  The aroma is interesting and funky & oh so characterful.  Tart, vinous, with a touch of sour-cherry, spicy oak, light balsamic, a touch of hot alcohol, lightly funky ripe cheese and barrel character that is quite reserved but plays a significant role.  The barrel character provides notes of spicy wood, buttery oak, and touches of very light bourbon aromatics (that hot alcohol mentioned earlier).  It is so easy to just keep smelling this beer for quite some time, but I feel I need to drink this before it loses all of its light carbonation.

Quite sour tasting, but tastes surprisingly distinctly of sour-cherries.  The carbonation is quite light, but adds a nice soft prickle to the tongue, just enough to perk up the texture.  The bourbon adds a bit of character to the finish, a touch of warming and some spiciness without being overwhelming.  Speaking of which, I am quite pleased by how soft of an impact the bourbon has here; I was worried that the bourbon would overwhelm this beer, but it is held well in check (I hope this is a trend that continues, over bourbond beers have been a bit overbearing lately for me).  Oak character provides mouth coating tannins and oak-heft that just make the texture feel so soft and inviting.  While quite tart, the sourness melds so well with the other flavors that it is not nearly as noticeable as it might be.  The tartness really accentuates a deep, tart, fruit character that is a mix of tannic cherries, rich plums and a touch tamarind.  As the beer warms up it picks up a phantom sweetness that accentuates the fruit character even that much more.

This is very nice, I was really expecting the Bourbon to be too much here, but instead it adds a bit more complexity without being over-bearing.  Too soon this beer is gone, a 12oz bottle was just not enough of this one.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3152,"2007-09-28",4.2,"A stirred bottle pours a very cloudy rust orange with yellowed amber glints. The color is largely unappealing but for the density. A thin light beige head recedes so slowly its barely worth noting. The nose exudes more initial complexity than previous encounters with JP barrel aged beers Ive sampled(Luciernaga and La Roja). Bourbon and wet wood lead, mild funk and spicy yeast thats peppery and sweet with boysenberry hints. The power of the nose is forceful to say the least, subjugating, tart wine vinous notes. Dark, very lightly toasted grains and surreal caramel are melded into a sticky canvas thats painted with heavy floral essences and honey. What was a sultry Bière de Garde has morphed into a multi-layered, lightly farmhouse flared malt bomb with subtle ties aplenty. This is a masterpiece...and that is no surprise. The flavor is more accessible and easily interpreted. Tartness is more evident and medium, quenching and releases a medium-high acidity that isnt cutting but sinks into the deep corners of the mouth nonetheless. Sweetness is writhing in semi-sweet caramel, medium-high overall, building. The yeast profile is peppery, dusty and farmy. Vinous notes are delicious. The finish is moderately tart, sweet and sumptious, full. Palate experience is ever-changing and fascinating, medium-full bodied, vividly but softly carbonated. I think this is great - aging something this complex and soft in something as barbaric as a bourbon barrel seems like an odd choice though, even at the hands of the master brewer and blender Ron Jeffries. I hope that future barrel aged beers see different types of barrels employed; bourbon is so ordinary in todays brewing climate.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

3152,"2006-11-23",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2010 12 Oz Bottle. Original Batch - 14 Months. Apple candy aroma, with a touch of apricots mellowed in ale, yet with some peculiar edges of old woman perfume. Some of the alcohol notes are deep and dark, with edges of caramel. Pour of a rich deep caramel, firey in glowing orange, with a thin rim of whitish. Flavor is a somewhat confused melange of bright awakening acidity in apple skin and white grape juice, with caramel syrup dangling with a fast flow of balsamic vinegar, between fading into a mellow fragrant lemon hop smack, yet remaining lightly subdues. Some of the nose-stinging acidity creates some balance. However, the flavor of this beer alights some muddiness and subtleness with a little less distinctive qualities, its still a deliciously complete package.

12oz Bottle. Second release - 27 months. Batch 65. Ah, theres that rich coconut husk and brown sugar delight I long for in a sour beer. Tangy, acidic and draped with lychee fruit. Tropical, slightly toasted, and restrained. Pours a rather clear firey red-orange, with a rim of soap in white. This is dense and maybe a little coarse. Shy of acetone for sure, but forward with vinegar-like acidity. Dry, but actually there are some toothy sugars that hold on and fight transformation, giving the acidity in this beer some serious balance. Morphing. Starts out with a sipping-necessary acid curtness, but then glides into a caramelized mango fruit flavor, before softening up (my tooth enamel) and glowing with a bit of oak and vanilla. Rather complex, but a bit tough to drink due to the searing acidity. Funk is composed of a light blue cheese bacteria, faint kefir, and cobwebs. Not too moldly or animal-like. This is interesting. The younger version isnt distinct enough in my brain to be able to compare, but this decent. Finishes with a spark of white grape pulp and brandy. Really surprised that any barrel character hasnt overwhelmed at this length. Dry oak character is balancing. Overall, interesting but a touch resistant to quaffing.


12oz Bottle - Third Release. All I really know about this release is that it was a really big bourbon bomb, which was enjoyable, but a bit one dimensional. Thanks Sean!


12oz stubby Bottle - Fourth Release. Thanks Sean! The lightest of the batch. Nose in plum, brandy, and acid, lactic mostly. Pours a hazed ruddy-brown, with a rim in white. Flavors are classic JP, funky bretts, dry cheese rind, hay, and springtime outdoors. Acidity and carbonation levels are good. Acids are bright and clean, a touch bitter and a touch dusty. The barrel chimes in nicely with some boozy depth and a smack of dry oakeness that really balances any residual sugars. Its one of the tighter and more balanced renditions in my book, but easily the lightest in terms of flavor depth and complexity.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Light bodied, highly carbonated, sparkling champagne-like mouthfeel.  Some nice grape tannins and spicy oak coat the tongue, somplimenting the bretts to create a clean, light fruit flavor impression.  Very nice balance between bretts, light fruits, and spicy oak, but the flavor dimensions are a bit subtle and arent overly complex.

A very drinkable and enjoyable beer, especially given its complexity.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3152,"2006-07-17",4.1,"Thanks to artusory. Warm amber body with light visible particulates and a scattering beige head. Great wild microbial characters in the nose with additional qualities suggesting ripe sour cherries, raspberry, vanilla and wood varnish. Flavor has lots of barnyard with a Balsamic vinegar note, medium acidity, and some sweet residual apple.  Very organic and pleasant. Another greatly enjoyed beauty from Jolly Pumpkin.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
3152,"2006-07-16",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2008 Rerate, 12oz bottle, batch 65, courtesy of Styles via artusory.  Thanks, guys!  So good to try this again after a long haitus.  Pours a murky dark brown with yellow edges; light tan head with fine-bubbled lacing; the addition of the yeast gives textured aggregates at the top.  Gorgeous aroma, showing plenty of bretty tartness, tropical fruits, and the slightest touch of warming vanilla and oak; some dried cherries, some funk.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: somewhat oily and lightly carbonated in the mouth; sour cherries, toasty oak and vanilla (minimal bourbony presence; adds a soft layer), tropical fruits and red fruits; the levels of acidity arent as intense as the regular version, which I see as a nice change; layered, intensely satisfying sour ale.  Just excellent, mouthwatering stuff.  Long finish: toasty oak, warming touch of bourbon and tart cherries; some funk that shows itself throughout.

Courtesy of artusory.  Wish I got more tasting notes down from this one.  Full-on sour nose; terribly drinkable approximation of a flemish sour (less puckering, with all the density).  Favorite JP so far; look forward to comparing it to the non-reserve. 9.4.8.4.17=4.2","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
3152,"2006-06-27",3.8,"Big 1cm lasting off-white head covers the cloudy deep burgundy pour. Immediately striking brett hits the nose, but as we reach saturation level, it appears very well integrated. Strangely woody in pointy manners, tartish cocoa blends into earthy minerals and various berries (raspberry, blueberry) amongst herbal and spicy tertiary flavours. Quite fruity in mouth, the barrel seems to impart growing amounts of alcohol which sucks the juiciness out of the berries. Light-medium bodied, rather attenuated, bretty and dark flavour profile, earthy. Lasting woody post taste gets a bit dominant. Gentle tight carbonation. Unique and intricating.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

A dark hazy caramel body with a smallish lasting white head provides....a nose that is all whisky smokiness and caramel at the front, gradually receding a bit to allow sour cherries and muted grapes an entrance.....on the tongue, its all Scotch whisky meets Flemish sour ale, sour/tart and smoky/woody at the same time, very edgy and powerful, lactic and musty, loads of cherries and grapes, but not really enough malt or the lovely vanilla-bourbon that for some reason I was expecting (duh, aged in bourbon...)....its a fascinating beer to be sure but the tastes and aromas seem more contrasting and at war than complimentary and friendly, to me....so, a near-miss.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

3152,"2006-05-18",4.3,"Bottle courtesy of Pailhead. Thanks, Kevin. As one who wasnt blown away by the non-reserve Biere de Mars, I was amazed at the reserve. This is impressive stuff. Theres so much going on on both the nose and the palate, that its frankly hard to describe. Theres the characteristic Montmorency cherry notes, and the raisan and wine, but theres also a great presence of spice. Finish is long-lasting and impressive.","Illinois, USA","Philip"

3152,"2006-05-10",4.0,"Garnet. Clingy dirty-white head displays a lathery thickness. Tangy and robustly vinous nose with notes of mangoes and balsamic vinegar. Faint notes of must, iron, and bourbon. Soft, finely conditioned carbonation. Watery body. Fairly depthless, initially, with a restrained sourness along with a loose tannic clutch. Tannins make a solid attempt at reinforcing the body, but fail to take foothold due to the wateriness. Delightfully composed bourbon offers a glimpse of sweetness which does strengthen the body a bit. Clean oakiness provides the palate with a gritty dryness as it gently skims the palate, but the flavors remain relatively simplistic up to this point. Extremely supple, however, with juicy tannins accentuating the ensuing succulent burst of melon and passion fruit. The lack of well-structured malt hurts the body somewhat, but the malts end up redeeming themselves by artfully underscoring the explosive juiciness with a straw-tinged backdrop. Finishes soft as satin with lingering hints of coconut and oaky tannins. Unlike many of their beers, which tend to be one-dimensional in their sourness and overrun by lactobacillus, this could actually use more acidity. Also needs a heftier body to coincide with the beautifully textured carbonation. With that said, the nose is particularly bright and aromatic (actually comes off as more of a Flemish Sour or Oud Bruin than anything else) and the flavors are a brilliant showcase of subtlety. Thanks, Styles.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3152,"2006-05-07",4.6,"Bottle from Styles.  Thanks VERY much.  The beer wanted very much to come out of the bottle.  I had to put my thumb over the top.  Fortunately, it was just a little extra carbonation and had no trouble after 10 seconds.  The beer pours to a red-hued brownish body thats hazy, carbonated, and has a dense off-white head.  It irradiates a glowing feel.  The aroma is lemons, cherries, brettanomyces, pie.  Interesting and nicely balanced.  I wouldnt say Bière de Garde at all.  More of a Flemish Sour mixed with an Old Ale given the aroma.  Either way, its really good.  The flavor is oak, dry leather, very-light bourbon, orange peel, pepper, tart cherries, floral hops.  I sampled this at room temperature.  Thank goodness too.  So many components of this might have been muddled by coldness.  I agree with Mike, this is perfect.  The palate is tart, medium-bodied, very easy drinking.  Warming feel even at only 7%.  Yet again, Jolly Pumpkin makes me a very happy person.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
3152,"2006-05-06",4.3,"Hmm, the carbonation level here is superb, leaving little organic islands. Love the color of this beer. The regular BdM is a great beer when its on, but lately with the second bottling Ive had some reduced carbonation and flat flavors. In an ideal sense the BdM should have a tart leatherness, as this version does (after all, its from the first run trough of this beer!). Almost 9 volt stinginess, plus some real fruitiness. Wonderful slippery, carbonated mouthfeel. But this one has more - it has a very nice bourbon presence that compliments and never overwhelms. Surprisingly good, about the same high level of craftsmanship seen in the Luciernaga Reserve. BBB63 is right, there are some flowery bits too.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
3152,"2006-05-05",4.5,"Thanks Chris for the hookup, served in my NB worthy glass: The brew pours a crimson imbued brown with a small tight fizzy head and very good lace. The nose detects brett and horseblanket, cherry and plum, tannin, rye and biscuit malt, mild cardamon and clove, and just a hit and run of bourbon, smell very inviting.  WOW, I was worried this would have become a brett sour bomb but it has kept just enough of its past life to make me really enjoy the new infusion of oak and bourbon which was done light handed, oh so YUMMY! Tart when it has to be and dry and flowery the next go around. THIS IS MORE A FLEMISH SOUR and a DAMN GOOD ONE!!! Some spice and even a bit a earthly yeast is noted as well. The mouth feel is light , airy and refreshing, much more approachable than many ""sour"" beers.  This is it Ron, please dont over do that aging, this is what I want....I NEED MORE!

The aroma is pretty awesome - light tart cherries with some notes of bittersweet chocolate, whiskey, and butterscotch. Interesting commingling of tart/acid fruits but certainly not as bretty and dry as the other varieties. Dark malt flavours with a good woody base and bourbon caramel softness. Sticky alcohol in the finish. Really nice balance and flavour integration. Thanks to Ron for the bottle!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"
3152,"2006-05-03",4.0,"Semi-translucent and deep reddish-amber in color with a thin grey sheaf for the head, recessing to an expansive ice overlay.  Profoundly ripe aroma rolls out sour, tannic cherries augmented by whiskey, rye, melba, smashed pinot grapes, lively peppered toffee, and pumpernickel soggied by a dry raspberry-chardonnay sauce.  Mighty dry and tart as we progress to the palate.  The course and harsh pils malt profile of the stock ale gives curt, husky resistance to the whiskey & rye bourbon composite.  Its flavorly forceful, imparting tart bordeaux cask qualities of turbid acidic accentuations.  Cackled white pepper meets hardened pumpernickel crust.  Citric acid of lemon rind scrapings impart sweet & sour tendencies with an earthen juncture interceding as if its been picked off the cotton farmers floor.  Effervescence is genial, body is mild mannered, and its got a stinging bite about it.  Semi-traditional hop prominence is accented by the dry, peppery rye persona, with a finish that commandeers attention, settling the score with oak, pinches of lime juice and chardonnay grapes going south.
