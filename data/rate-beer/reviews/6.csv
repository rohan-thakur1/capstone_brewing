Pouring a mostly clear light orange yellow with a dense, off-white head that falls off to a ring leaving little lacing, this looks solid. The nose is just incredible. Bright, juicy, fruity hops with a moderate amount of coriander, beautifully paired to amplify each others strengths along with a little bit of citron and lemon, this just smells incredible. In some ways, this is not unlike jal-jeera,. Coriander character is bright and fresh, lightly toasted. Salt is minimal. Some mild gin-like aromatics are also present.

The palate opens quite sour with a big citrusy sourness, lemony and moderately potent along with a mild coriander note. The citrus sourness pairs beautifully with the hops, juicy and fruity with a blend of citrus, tropical fruit (pineapple, mango, guava). Mildly briny on the finish along with some citrus sourness, this is incredible stuff. Highly recommended.","Oregon, USA","dyan"
6,"2014-10-23",3.9,"Bottle... Poured hazy, pale, yellow with a thin head. Aroma of oak, citrus, botanicals, and green, earthy hops. Some tart acidic notes with bitter hops which lent to a pickled greens flavor (in a great way). Drying and tart towards the finish with a hint of tangy, brine-like, coriander and spice in there too.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"

6,"2014-10-22",4.3,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. Aroma is super fruity with a ton of pineapple and mango and lighter papaya and guava. Moderate citrus notes of grapefruit, orange and lemon. Faint coriander and light oak. Pours a very hazy, pale yellow straw with a moderately thick, medium sized, white head with decent retention as it recedes to the edges. No lacing and faint legs. Flavor is lightly acidic with a lot of tropical fruit juiciness. Lots of grapefruit and pineapple with some lighter mango, guava and papaya. Moderate citrus character with some orange and lemon. Very light coriander and faint oak notes. Low bitterness. Light saltiness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Overall, a really delicious beer but it lacks the salinity that I expect a gose to have or the juiciness hides the salt. Super crushable. Lots of pineapple.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
6,"2014-10-17",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 18, 2014 Bottle with Paul and Linh. Pours a beautiful hazy peachy orange with thick white lacing. Aroma is the most perfected combination of lime, funk, lemonade and sea salt. Incredible nose - and essentially perfect for a Gose. Mouthfeel is delicate sour key lime pie, lemonade, funk, sour peaches, barn and light bacteria. Awesome - seek this out now.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"

6,"2014-09-28",4.5,"Bottle, thanks for hooking this one up Chris. Pours hazy golden with very thin head with tiny bubbles. Flavor is insanely juicy and rinded out yo. Notes of lemon, kiwi, red grapefruit, salt, earth, spruce/pine, and vitamins. All kinds of tropical minerality in this beauty of a brew. Prickly carbonation with a super tart peach finish. Top 3 Ive tried for the style.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
6,"2014-09-11",4.7,"Bottle, thanks Jack! Wow, this is some amazing drink. One of the best I have ever had. Funky, light salt, coriander, citrus, more funk. Flavor is similarvery drinkablelike Gose gone wild but a little more drinkable. This is magical. I dont what to say anymore. I always put in the worst ratings for my top rated shit cuz Im in so much awe I am speechless. Best De Garde to date, and that is saying a lot.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
