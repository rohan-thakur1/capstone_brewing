I love the meaty smoke laced with heavily caramelized malts and hints of chocolate. Appearance: Very dark brown, nearly black; mostly opaque; repestable tan-colored head. Flavor: Delicious blend of smoked meat, dark chocolate, roasted and caramelized malts with just the right amount of residual sweetness, roasted coffee beans and some cacao nibs in the finish mingled with some charred wood/charcoal flavors; FANTASTIC synergy of flavors! Palate: Medium-full body; slightly thick and creamy on the tongue; nice body that supports the flavors well.

Thick, viscous mouthfeel initially, but balanced at the finish. Taste is dark fruits, a touch of roast, dark caramel and light smoke. I would like the smoke flavor to be more pronounced.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"
1834,"2011-12-09",3.2,"In short: A moderately smoky porter with a few things I didnt like.  Just ok
How: Bottle 12oz.  Consumed approximately 8 months after first rating.  Was there many batches?  Anyway, at most 8 months old
The look: Black body topped by a large dark beige head that quickly recedes to a small layer of foam
In long: Nose is moderately smoky, nothing overwhelming here, and the smoke has a smoked pork character.  Taste is soft black liquorice candy, some figs, plums, roast, some boiled asparagus, some molasses, some tar.  And of course the smoke which added a strong smoked pull pork flavor to the beer.  Overall not a bad beer but there was a few things that didnt quite worked with me in this beer.  Another ordinary beer from Left Hand.  My love for this brewery knows bounds.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The aroma has lots of espresso and a meaty undertone, unfortunately pure smoke is not the most prominent flavor but there is enough to impart a very hearty, roasty nose on it.

The nose has some roasted malt character as well as some nice chocolate and espresso notes with a bit of dark fruit backing. Dark chocolate is the predominant character.

The taste is pretty congruent with the nose, as theres some roast up front followed by some slightly-bitter espresso as well as chocolate, and then finishing up with some dry bitterness.

Strengths include not letting the Cherrywood get too cloying, an all too common problem I find with that smoked malt.

Still, here I am drinking it on a 60 degree day. Very nice beer, a bit sweet, the cherrywood is in check.. Id prefer a different smoke, more meaty, and more dominant.

The smell has root beer, dark fruits, sugar, buttery malts, metal, and some chocolate. No smoke what so ever, is it a joke?

The flavor is a bit more believable. It is fruity and roasty. Still not smokey at all but at least there is a roasted flavor. I think they made a bad decision when they used a Baltic porter rather than an English, or American porter.

A vigorous pour yields just a small, creamy, mocha-khaki head that dissipates quickly.  The wispy film that remains gives tattered, feathery bands of lacing to the glass.  Aromas are well balanced, showing bitter, earthy, dark cacao nibs and roasted coffee in the foreground, with a sweetly smoky overtone and notes of grilled, dark, caramelized fruits.  Theres some plum in there and definitely some blackened fig, along with a good amount of scorched caramel.  The flavor largely mirrors the nose, showing a sharp, bitter chocolate bite with backup coffee roast, and blackened, caramelized sugars.  A bite of anise lends sharpness, while the smoke comes across mainly sweet and slightly nutty.  The palate is smooth and fairly light on carbonation, but it comes across as a bit sugary and sticky on the finish.  It sits pretty heavy and drinks slow.

1834,"2011-02-24",3.8,"This is quite an impressive brew, in all measures.
Pouring from the bottle to the glass, it looks like a beer that means business.....you cant get any closer to black. The cappucino tan head dissipates quickly, leaving an opening for you to gaze into the darkness.
Certainly a smoky malt aroma, hints of some stewed fruits, some browned caramels and a bit of alcohol. Very inviting.
Tastes of dark sugars, giving way to a sweet, smoky body with hints of vanilla.
The finish is like velvet, almost creamy, but still present is the smoky body and a nice warming alcohol slide. 
I really enjoyed this brew. It is wonderfully impressive, but restrainand in all the right areas. Even if youre not a fan of very dark, smoked malt brews, i encourage you to try it....you wont be disappointed.
If I smoked cigars, I would certainly have one with this beer too.","Houston, Texas, USA","stephenj007"

1834,"2011-02-22",3.9,"12 ounce bottle - $1.89 at Olde Crabapple Bottle Shoppe in Alpharetta, Georgia. Bottled on: 11/11/10.

Appearance: Pours out a black body topped with a medium-sized, tan-head that quietly slips out of existence, leaving behind a skimpy ring.

Smell: The Smoked Baltic Porter smells of chocolate, espresso powder, roasted malts, dark German rye bread, a bit of dark fruitiness, meats cooking over a campfire, and ground-up Whoppers candies.

Taste: Malty tastes of dark chocolate squares, callously burnt sugars, and scorched bread crusts given a generous sip of Italian roast coffee. Charcoal and smoked currants follow. Medium sweetness. Some underlying earthy hop character brings about a slight bitterness. Takes on more dark bready character as it warms. A chew of smoky beer jerky nearing the roasty finish with a bit of tangy Hershey chocolate bar in the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Light creaminess.

Drinkability: Its a good, well-crafted smoky brew. Sufficiently smoky for me, though some might consider it a bit too restrained. A nice addition to the burgeoning FtB series.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

The aroma is at first very similar to that of a mocha with chocolate and espresso tones but a good bit of smoky ash works its way in there as well, overall it smells powerfully roasty. The flavor mirrors much of the coffee, chocolate, and ash that was presented in the aroma. The smoke here is fairly subdued yet on the threshold of too high for a traditional baltic porter. I doubt that the intent here was to try to interpret a traditional baltic porter, and what were given is a beer that is basically a more strongly smoked version of the neo-baltic porters, that I admit to loving quite a bit. As it warms some earthiness presents its self both in a hoppy (leaves & woodyness) and malty (namely soil) sort of way.

The beer pours a very dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the chocolate and caramel malt, with some nice smoked notes mixed in. The beer is smokey without being overwhelming. Very nice.

The flavor is more of the same. I get a nice amount of smoke in the flavor, but I also get some chocolate and roasted malt. There is also a slight amount of coffee in the flavor. The smoke is not as meaty as with a lot of the smoked beers I have tried - such as the Aecht Schlenkerla beers - but it is still very enjoyable. 

Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice overall and a very good smoked beer for those that enjoy the style.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"

1834,"2011-01-10",4.1,"Bottle.

A - Cola brown/black with a creamy, good sized, thin meringue, fluffy, light cafe color. Really nice retention with a nice lace left.

S - Really nice and interesting aroma. Smoked meat and smokiness comes out first. Not super smoked meat aroma, but more balanced and smoked wood. Next whiff brings out some roasted coffee and a little bit of coffee and roasted malt. Hints of earthy and dark fruit aroma in the back.

T - Just like the nose, the flavor is a mix of smoked meat and wood and some roasted coffee and malt. The smoked wood flavor starts out the sip with it fading into more of a smoked meat. Not overly pork-like like some smoked meat flavors. Mid sip some more roasted coffee and malt along with some chocolate. Faint hints of tart dark fruit. Finishes with a slight tart flavor and faint hop bite. Slight bitterness on the finish.

M - Medium body with average carbonation. Pretty creamy fullish feel.

D - Nice beer to sip with a good balance between the smokiness and the porter flavors. Not one I would drink a lot of in a day but I would drink again.

Notes: Really nice balance between the smoked wood, smoked meat, and traditional porter flavors. Definitely has a smokey aspect, but that doesnt dominate the flavor. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. Not amazing but quite good.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

I wouldve had a second or third, had my wife not been nagging me to leave. Damn her.  Anyway, well done!","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","manny57"
1834,"2010-11-26",4.3,"bottle.  pours a nice deep black out of the bottle with some lighter brown highlights and a 1 finger tan head, which falls in a couple minutes leaving a thin tan lacing.  wonderful nose - the smoke level is perfect... it is not over the top in any way... layers of deep cherry, caramel, currants and roasted malts linger through the smoked malts.  medium to full body with a very smooth and soft palate.  lots of dark fruits including raisins, red grapes, cherries and plums coat the mouth with a perfect smoke malt presence lingering up top and to the back.  a general sweetness persists throughout.  chocolate, coffee and smoked malts fill the back of the mouth through the finish.  This is an excellent beer from Left Hand!","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","craftbeerdesign"
