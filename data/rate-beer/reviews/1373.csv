1373,"2016-01-21",3.8,"On tap (12 oz) at LAmère à Boire. Clear dark copper with a small off-white head leaving good lacing. Aroma is of fresh bread and fresh cereals along chocolatey notes, caramel, mild fruitiness and earthy notes. Taste is also fresh bread and fresh cereals along chocolate, nutty notes, mild fruitiness, caramel and minereal/earthy notes. Light to medium body. Medium to good carbonation. Rather dry finish. Short aftertaste. Nice malt depth despite the low abv and light-ish body. Extremely easy drinking and quenching while quite flavorful.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
1373,"2013-01-31",3.7,"Superbe arome de cereales fraichement broyés et de chocolat, vraiment frais et élégant pour une si petite bière. Ça se poursuit en bouche avec une agréable torréfaction et même une membrane houblonnée. Belle petite bête.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
1373,"2012-01-27",3.5,"Une robe acajou.  Une belle tête mousseuse.  Une dentelle collante.  Un nez étonnant.  Du bon pain grillé.  Des grains entiers.  Une touche de houblons.  Un accent chocolaté.  Des saveurs qui suivent les arômes.  Des céréales qui rappellent les pains slaves.  Des houblons et des malts foncés qui présentent un profil plutôt asséchant.  Une lointaine touche fruitée.  Un corps moyen avec un juste pétillement.  Une texture qui me rappelle la petite crème.  Une finale qui permet lémergence dune fine amertume.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
1373,"2011-02-10",3.3,"Une pinte sur place. 3,6% alc /vol. Bière brune foncée avec une belle mousse. Nez de houblon, léger, frais. Bouche agréable, rôtie, torréfaction légère, fraîche. Beaucoup de goût pour une bière avec si peu dalcool. Surprenante et très agréable.","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","rodenbach99"
1373,"2010-05-18",3.7,"Draught at LAmère à Boire. Pours a deep amber-brown with a small creamy tan head. Nice aroma,  its roasty along with some coffee, chocolate, caramel and a bit of cream. Flavour, Wow, its a touch watery but this is really flavourful for a 3.6% beer -- well done! Malty, chocolaty and a bit roasty. Average bodied. Great stuff, kudos for such a great Mild beer.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","blankboy"
1373,"2010-04-29",3.7,"Draught - April 23, 2009 - at LAmère à Boire.  Pulled from the elephant at the bar (sadly, not out of the elephants ass ...).  Holy crap this is a dark, opaque beer for well under 4% - pretty much solid black, with some red around the edges - and a solid creamy beige or darker head.  Has a really interesting aroma - long-dried wildflowers and very dry roast cocoa malt with a hint of dairy cream - not at all sweet - frankly, this seemed more a mild, but either way, roasty, no alcohol, appealing, and dry.  The taste follows, but its even more like a mild - less cocoa, still not sweet, and it has an almost scorched fresh dry grain taste too it - sessionable and outstanding either way.  Light-bodied, softly carbonated, absolutely no alcohol at all (I could drink buckets of this), and a nice dry, slightly bitter linger.  Wonderful light beer.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
1373,"2010-04-08",3.6,"Dark brown color, with a thick tan head, leaving some laces, nice light smooth chocolatey, cocoa, roasted, toasted malt nose with some hints chocolate praline, raw maltiness, and some light burnt fruitcake notes in the aroma follows through on a light-bodied palate with  a mild roasted, chocolate, toasted malt, mochaish, chocolatey praline character with some faint dark dried fruit, black coffee flavors and a hint of molasses, leading towards a soft roasted, chocolatey, lingering bitterness finish.","montréal, Quebec, CANADA","rederic"
1373,"2010-03-29",3.6,"Drank on tap (20 oz) at the brewpub, March 28, 2010. Dark nut brown, average pale beige head. Aroma of toasted malt, plenty of raw grains and nuts. Taste of sweet malt coffee,  slightly bitter, an aftertaste of bittersweet chocolate. Quite tasty and enjoyable for a -4%!","Boisbriand, Quebec, CANADA","Quevillon"
1373,"2010-03-12",3.0,"A deep dark reddish brown ale with a thin lacing dark moka head. An herbaceous grainy nutty malt aroma, a bit wild and off. In mouth, a smooth nutty and herbal malt, a bit ligt in body, served cask temperature. On tap at brewpub, Feb. 12  2010.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
1373,"2010-03-07",3.8,"On tap at the brewery.  Dark black with a thin head. Average retention. Aroma is chocolate, caramel, coffee and herbal notes. Flavor is Coffee, chocolate, cereals and some bitterness. Thin to medium body. I am amazed at the amount of flavor for a 3,5% abv beer. This is dangerously drinkable with a solid flavor profile. Very well done!","Mirabel, Quebec, CANADA","Diogène"
1373,"2010-02-05",3.9,"On tap. Beautiful black body with white lasting head. Aromas are roasted malts,anise, dark chocolate, grapes. Extremely flavourful for 3.5% beer; burn toast, old coffee. Taste like breakfast. Soft carbonation with a a dry bitter finish and above average mouthfeel. Excellent.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
1373,"2010-02-01",3.6,"Aroma has burnt malt and coffee notes, almost black, pours a small tan head. Flavour is toasted malt, dark bread, light coffee notes. Light bodied, very well balanced, especially smooth, and quite drinkable. Lovely! (The tap is Fantastic too!)","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DougShoemaker"
1373,"2010-01-26",3.7,"In short: A great 3.5% complex hoppy dark lager.  Authentic Czech Tmavé with hops cranked up a bit.
How: Tap at brewpub
The look: Clear mahogany-ruby body topped by a long-lasting medium tan head
In long: Nose rather authentic Tmavé except that this ones aroma has a strong woody and herbal hops.  A large number of flavours in this deceivingly complex little beer.  Chocolaty nuts, wood, some refreshing tropical fruits, some raisins, fruity cake.  Nice woody and herbal hops that offer a mild woody dryness and bitterness.  Wow, this is very satisfying for a 3.5% brew.  My favourite of the Elephant lineup.  Dumbo would have been proud had he not been sucked in by a jet engine.  God rest his soul.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1373,"2010-01-21",3.7,"En fût. Verre de 12 oz à la brasserie. Arôme: Odeur de céréales grillées avec une pointe de caramel. Apparence: La couleur est noire. Présence dun moyen col mousseux et dune fine dentelle sur le verre. Saveur: Goût de seigle noir avec une pointe de chocolat. Durée moyenne de larrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une texture légèrement crémeuse. Moyenne effervescence en bouche. Légère présence de céréales grillées en arrière goût. (Rating #2839)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","TaktikMTL"
1373,"2010-01-02",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Whiffs of cocoa and toasted caramel scent this refreshing Tmavé Vycepni, before delicate herbal hops and oncoming dryness claim the finish.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy sheet of foam draws plenty of lacing atop the black with blood red hues.
-Kudos to AABoire for trying a style that is virtually absent outside of the Czech Republic and doing it very well too!
-The light fruitiness of Munich-like malts is tasted.
-This is drier than I expected, and so absurdly drinkable.
-This has a very pleasant body despite the low alcohol.

On tap at the brewpub.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
