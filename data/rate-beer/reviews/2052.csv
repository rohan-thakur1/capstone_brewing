2052,"2017-02-26",3.6,"Bottle shared, hazy brown color with small but creamy top. Smell is rust, metal, dirty malt, and spit fruit. Flavor is apples, wine, and grape skins. Wet oak. Medium bodied with lighter carbonation. Not up to standards for Sara.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"

2052,"2015-01-22",4.0,"Bottle... This beer rocks! Pours murky and caramel-colored with a small, creamy, white head. Good retention. The nose is malty, fruity, leathery and acidic. Full-bodied and creamy with tickling carbonation. The flavor furnishes heavy tartness, mild caramel sweetness and light, tannic bitterness. Finishes malty, tart, and then dry with a tongue-numbing finale. Kudos to 50belair for sharing this world class bottle of beer!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2052,"2014-11-10",4.1,"750ml Bottle  reviewed from notes (May, June 2014). Aroma is tart cherry, light red apple and pear with a musty woodsy note as well. The tartness is more akin to a yogurt kind of rotting/over ripe fruit, but it works really well with the oaky, yeasty funk. The beer pours a brownish-red, copper color with a fluffy off-white head. The taste is really fruity and toasty, with the apple and cherry complimenting the malts. Reminds of a tart caramel apple, of sorts. The body is medium with medium carbonation. The finish is tart, fruit and earthy with just enough oak to balance everything out. Really delicious beer; those house bugs are something special!","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
2052,"2014-09-28",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 4, 2014 Bottle: Thanks, Chris. Rusty copper body, 99% opaque with a slightly off-white, soapy head & bubbly collar. Aroma of light toasty malt, lemon-y & slightly lactic tartness, a touch of yogurty lacto, mild grass, a bit of stone fruit skin acidity, & some mild berry-like sweetness. Nice, tart flavor. Plenty of lacto yeast & critters with a strong, yet mellow & well integrated woodiness. Lemon, peach, & some white grape skin that borders on vinous towards the finish. Hints of cobweb-y barnyard & woodsy funk underneath it all with a touch of lactic acid & yogurt in the finish. Light cherry skin & lemon lingering, too. Faint toasty malts. Really nice beer.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
2052,"2014-08-02",3.4,"Bottle thanks to Will. Pours a cloudy orange with small frothy white head. The aroma is strong rubber, bandaid, funk, oak. Medium mouthfeel with strong funk, veggie, oak and light fruit. Good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
2052,"2014-06-28",3.7,"750 mL bottle. 
Aroma is very fruity with quite a bit of overripe stone fruit, peaches, pears, red apple and citrus. Moderate toasted bread with hints of toffee and caramel. Hints of light phenolics and citrus.
Pours a murky, light brown with some copper hues and a thick, somewhat small, tan head that shows average retention as it recedes to the edges and lingers. Lacing is moderate with small legs. 
Flavor is slightly tart with quite a bit of fruit character. Lots of cherry, cassis, fig, prune and plum with some light red apple. Light acidity adds hints of lemon and orange. Medium light bitterness. Medium light malt notes of toasted bread with hints of toffee and caramel. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a pretty nice beer, but I have a hard time characterizing this as a Biere de Garde. It is missing the malt character that I would expect, but the fruit notes and the light acidity are great. This reminds me more of a fall/winter saison, but perhaps that is nitpicking","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
2052,"2014-02-18",4.0,"Bottle thanks to my friend from bay area. Light brownish pour with an off white head. Mild sour fruit aromas. Smooth and mellow with sour fruit and citrus highlights. Very good mouthfeel and body. Another solid bottle from SARA...","Florida, USA","50belair"
2052,"2014-01-31",3.8,"Bottle. shared @SARA. Pours cloudy chestnut, small tan head, decent lacing. Aroma is tart cherry, oaky, a bit of barnyard funk. Really opens up as it warms. Flavor is light sweet, light tart, some funkiness but not strong, lots of oak tannins, but not much astringence. Fairly light body, drying finish. Let this one breathe a bit if you want to enjoy it.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
2052,"2014-01-30",4.0,"Cloudy caramel color, not much foam but it laces. Light sour aroma, cherry. Flavor is tart up front, fruity, then lactic. Turns into a bread flavor in the finish. Mix of sweet and dry. Subtle, well-crafted beer.","California, USA","barn0216"
2052,"2014-01-30",3.6,"Nice beer, with a nice caramel color. Noticeable, but not over powering sour/funk flavor, but is a pleasant drink","","Indecipherable"
