606,"2016-10-16",4.2,"Got in a BIF from oline73. 500 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/13/2016. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense dark brown head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted oats, caramel, dark bread, toffee, herbal, and floral; with lighter notes of pepper, nuttiness, smoke, char, dark fruit, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, and moderate earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted oats, caramel, dark bread, toffee, herbal, and floral; with lighter notes of pepper, nuttiness, smoke, char, dark fruit, and roast/toasted earthiness. Moderate roast/char and herbal/spicy hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted oats, caramel, dark bread, toffee, herbal, floral, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, and moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great roast/hop bitter/sweet balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from roast/hop bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/bready, and lightly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding oatmeal stout! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, and moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink. The coffee has faded a fair amount as expected given the bottle dating; but this is still a wonderfully well balanced, complex, and spot on example of the style. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Poured at the usual too-cold fridge temperature into a Mikkeller signature glass reveals a mostly black body with one finger of toffee head that subsides after a while leaving little film but beautiful lace. Solid regeneration. Left to sit in the window sill for half an hour but still pretty cold during appreciation. Aroma is dominated by roasted malt with a notable absence of disharmonic notes and the roast itself being decidely augmented by the tangible yet not rough or unpleasant coffee notes. Coffee can take many forms in a beer and some of them make you think more of the coffee grounds. That is not the case for this beer where you get the best of the aroma notes from freshly roasted beans as far as I can tell. Its like the aeropress of stouts perhaps. Imbibing the brew reinforces the impression of a smooth, no-nonsense coffee stout. The mouthfeel is sufficiently oily to support the aroma and flavour yet not viscous in a bottom heavy sense. Oats have been dispensed competently of course. Is there sugar in this coffee? Well its certainly not harsh, ascerbic or rough but it would be a lie to say I could taste the sugar cube or that it got cloying in any way. This is a fine specimen for a coffee stout and it probably replaces Gammas La Cabra as my #1 contender for a breakfast beer in real life. It may not be as gratifying aromawise as the Maple Bacon but its certainly much more smooth, elegant and refined in the flavour and the mouthfeel.","DENMARK","humlelala"

606,"2016-03-30",3.8,"750mL growler filled 3/18/16 and drunk 3/25/16.Perfect pour as expected; massive tan head tops an ebony body with strong retention. Clarity undetermined.Rich and bready in the nose, with strong roast, vanilla and treacle suggestions. Very fudgey, especially with warming but the dry, cellar/plaster-like house yeast character helps allay some of this. The coffee is strong but not overbearing and pretty well integrated with the malt character. No alcohol or flaw noted.In the mouth its a bit more difficult to rate. The flavors are certainly rich and well-developed, with tons of chocolate fudge, espresso and vanilla. Coffee is not intensely bitter or heavily roasted and theres a fair amount of syrupy treacle-meets-marshmallow-meets-chocolate-toffee flavor. Carbonation is low though not particularly so for a stout. No alcohol or flaws with a very malty, somewhat syrupy texture. Though there is some amount of enjoyable ash/char, it could still use some more dryness and I dont think this is supposed to be a sweet stout, though it would work better as one of those. Nonetheless, quite drinkable and flawless in the flavor category.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

A - Pours jet black with a light one finger head, dissipating to small patches of head, leaving little to no lacing down the glass.

S - Lots of dark flavors in this one. Coffee, milk chocolate, and plenty of dark malt blend well. Some oatmeal and a bit of caramel sweetness creeps in as it begins to come to room temp. Good balance but nothing mind blowing.

T - A bit thin on entry. Quite a bit of dark smokiness up front giving way quickly to a mix of dark roasted coffee and chocolatey sweetness. Oatmeal adds a bit of chewiness and seems to help bring the body back up a bit. Finish is a huge blast of dark roast that lingers for some time. I liked how balanced all the flavors where.

M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. The feel is neither thin nor overly creamy, good balance again. Finish is a bit too roasty for my liking.

606,"2011-01-07",4.1,"Sampled on draft at Capones.

Pours pitch black and comletely opaque without even the slightest trace of lifhtercolor when held to a light source and a one finger mocha colored head that slowly disappears leaving sporadic spots of lacing behind.

Slightly roasted coffee bean aroma with silky chocolate malt, oatmeal, toffee and hazelnut. Its very refreshing to encounter a coffee stut that doesnt smell like a burnt coffee bomb. Im even picking up some slight citrus and earhy hops. Im excited to drink this one.

Chewy full body with a great balance of roasted coffee bean, silky, luscious dark chocolate, oatmeal, toffee and bitter hops. Slight lactic character adds creaminess and fullness to the body and greatly increases the drinkabilitu. Im actually surprised how well balanced this is. I was expected it to be more acrid and bitter even though the aroma didnt suggest that. Slight citrus and earthy pine hops add complexity. This is a very well crafted, extremely quaffable coffee beer. Not very extreme but damn good.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Flavor really brings the oatmeal to the forefront, though the vanilla and chocolate are present enough to provide a wonderful balance. A touch of hop character comes through as well. Palate is delightfully full-bodied and rich, particularly for a non-imperial stout. Amazing stuff.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

606,"2010-12-10",4.2,"In short: A roasted stout with plenty of coffee and plenty of refreshing fruity hops.  Wow!
How: Tap at the brewery
The look: Black body topped by a medium beige head
In long: The strong nose is an admirable mixture of roasted coffee beans and fruity hops that seems to be made for each-other.  Taste is has plenty of very roasted malts, plenty of coffee beans, burnt black cake, a lot of refreshing fruity hops (tropical fruits).  With all that roastiness and fruity hops the finish is both very dry and very refreshing.  Carbonation is appropriately lively.  I could drink this all night long.  I cant believe how well the hopping worked with the coffee in this beer.  First time I get that mixture of coffee and refreshing fruity hops.  This is unfortunately only available in growler at the moment.  A full growler is a lot.  And just because *I can* drink a full growler by myself doesnt mean I wont.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

606,"2010-09-06",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2012 On tap at the brewery. I really wish I knew how to make stout of Danish 

influence. Is it the water? Theres just something so 

delightfully intense about the viscosity, roast, and 

brightness of these kind of stouts. Its got an 

almost pine-like or juniper-scented roast character 

to it that gives it a real terroir. This example is 

very much similar to the Mikkeller Beer Geek, the 

Nogne beers, or the Olbutikken Porter, with really 

amazing density, roast flavor complexity, and a 

mature alcohol profile. Considering that I generally hate coffee in beer, this is a very remarkable example, with a clean, well-integrated and fresh presence thats enjoyable and flavorful. I craved this beer most of 

all at Hill Farmstead.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
