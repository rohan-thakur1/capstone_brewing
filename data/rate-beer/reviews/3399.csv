3399,"2017-01-29",4.3,"375 mL bottle. Deep red body with a medium off-white head. Smells of acidic red wine. Oak. A touch of vinegar and maltiness. Tastes pretty sour. Really strong red wine flavor that builds throughout. Sweet malts that come off as dark fruit get cut by some vinegar sourness. Strong oak presence. Dry finish. Medium heavy, but not sluggish. I did not expect this to be this good.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
3399,"2017-01-28",4.4,"Bottle. Clear light brown pour with a kaki head. Vinous aromas. Sour vinous, sour cherry, oak, vanilla, caramel malts, and very mild vinegar notes. Complex and delicious. A real stunner. Great body and mouthfeel.","Florida, USA","50belair"

3399,"2016-11-10",4.5,"Bottle shared by Blisscent on 11/5/16.Bright, cherry-auburn body is topped by a beige head with no retention.Huge estery cherry character with long, long oak mixing in; very rich and even. Great mix of maltiness (light caramel, date, fig, bread) and acetic acid. Really quite the perfect amount. No alcohol or yogurt rind/astringency. Wow, this is sublime and one of the better Flanders red ales Ive come across, certainly so for an American rendition.Soft body with the perfect amount of maltiness. Very impressive that this thing isnt over-dry, grainy and loose after six years. Far from it. Light honey-caramel, lots of black pepper and fruity, cherry pit-like spiciness. No sign of the alcohol here nor any flaw. Light wood character again in the flavor, but free from any toasty oakiness, as it should be. Low but tight carbonation. Really fucking phenomenal stuff. Not even saying that because of its rarity ;)","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3399,"2016-11-05",4.3,"375 mL bottle. from the aroma you can tell this beer is over 6 years old. Smell old and woody but in a good way. This is so vinous. Almost a red wine mouthfeel. You can taste the 50 months in the barrels this is very oaky but I really enjoy this. Nice tartness, red fruit, red wine and very long finish. So well balanced. Cant believe this beer is over 6 years old this is impressively delicious. Good job Hill farmstead!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Samact"
3399,"2016-10-31",4.4,"Six Years for Six Thousand ticks on Halloween. I figured this would be the perfect bottle for the special occasion. Pours a dark reddish brown color with tiny bubbled short lasting medium head. Lighter carb overall. Smell is dark grapes, berries, vinegar, plum juice and barrel. Flavor is brown sugar, grape skins, misc berries, oak, apples, dark plum vino and other wet wood complexities. Finishes as toffee grape juice with perfect acidity for the style. Warming behind the ears and back of the head. Medium to fuller in the mouthfeel. This treat was paired with fresh frozen, 90u OG Gorilla Haze full melt in case anyone was curious. Cheers","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
3399,"2016-10-19",4.3,"Pours a clear brown with a small offwhite head that leaves some lacing. Nose is of grapes, balsamic, trace acetone (not sure I should mention it as it was really like and not detracting at all), wine and brown sugar. Taste is more dark sugar and moderately tart and winey. Body is medium, carbonation moderate and it just feels vinous like a fuller than full bodied red wine if that makes sense. Never too intense and really classy. A really, really nice experience overall. Id be all over this stuff if it was (a lot) cheaper!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
3399,"2016-10-17",4.4,"Bottle (375 ml), shared. Beautiful deep amber with a small bubbly beige head leaving little lacing. Aroma is incredibly complex with oak, vinous presence, dark and red fruits, grapey, must, balsamic, caramel and earthy notes. Taste is , vanilla, moderately tart, quite oaky with fun balsamic presence, red wine, mild earthiness, caramel and grapes. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Oak mouthfeel. Gently tart and red wine finish. Incredibly complex, really well balanced for a six years old beer that spend 50 months in barrels. Lovely.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

3399,"2016-07-31",4.2,"375ML bottle, stored upright since purchase in May at 38F. Split 2 ways in Teku glassware. 

A - Dark reddish brown, wood-like color, 2 finger cream brown head. Its fully carbed but not intensely, good whisp of air on cap pop w/o gushing.

S - It smells like an ultra-aged Rodenbach Grand Cru Vintage with musty old grape, wine, citrus and apples.

T - Very nice! I honestly dont get any oxidation at all. Cherries, cinnamon, cardamom and apples. A ton of oak presence but not overpowering, ashy, or gross flavors. I honestly really like this a lot. wine is well integrated, everything is just balanced.

M - lightly carbonated even on a hard swish, has a dessert wine like oily-ness

O - Highly enjoyable. I would believe this was 24-36 months in a barrel. The fact that this spent 50 months in a barrel is absurd and hardly believable. This is possibly the best Flemish Red incarnation Ive ever consumed. Fantastic work. One of my favorite styles (when done right).","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
3399,"2016-07-31",4.1,"Dark brown pour with some nice fluffy off white head. Smells like cherries and dark fruits. Awesome mouthfeel - Im so glad this is well carbonated. Flavor is nice, light, a bit tart, and not overwhelmingly sour. This is so awesome for this beer style.","New Hampshire, USA","Heather_B"

3399,"2016-06-15",4.2,"375 mL bottle at Hill Farmstead with ebone1988 on the Beercation. So glad I got to try this. The pour is a dark reddish brown with a thin ring of light khaki colored head that leaves a couple spots of lace. There is a nice burgundy shining through the beer thats real nice. The aroma is very woody. There is a nice vinousness and a light oakiness in front of a little bit of darker fruits. Its really well balanced and I like that. The flavor is very oaky. There is a great sourness up front from the wine barrel, but the woodiness is nice. The wine is a little aggressive but its balanced by the sweet barrel. The mouth feel is thicker and well carbonated with a lovely lingering winey fruit on the findish. Lightly dry and lingering. I like this.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
