2378,"2012-05-20",3.5,"Bottle at home, 19th May. Cracked this without much hiss, wonder whether, bottle is OK, little or no head formed and carbo is very light. Red brown ale in the glass, smells good, taste is pineapple, some citrus and malt, I am a little put off by the flat beer, which is possibly to warm at the suggested 12 degrees. Will try another bottle from the fridge to check","London Town, Greater London, ENGLAND","CraftBeerNick"

2378,"2012-04-20",3.9,"Tried on cask. Looks ok, reddish brown with fluffy head, smells like a pine cleaner which is strange. Quite sweet but then bitter like grapefruit. Strange but tasty.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Charlieboy"
2378,"2012-04-18",3.8,"Bottle, Beer Ritz, Leeds. Very murky reddy brown pour with a dissipating yet ultimately lingering tan head. Nose had plenty of fruity hop alongside notes of sweet malt and vanilla. Fullish mouthfeel and relatively gentle carbonation. Flavour had some great fruitiness alongside sweet malts, a little spice and some well placed hop bitterness. Satisfyingly lingering bitter finish. Theres a solid vein of quality running throughout this brew, as indeed there is in most of the output eminating from the ever-improving Buxton stable. Nice one fellas. My 1500th Rate. Cheers !","Wirral, Merseyside, ENGLAND","wyzzywyz22"
2378,"2012-04-05",3.6,"Bottle shared with Nick at the Euston Tap, London on my birthday. Pours hazy red-golden-brown with a soft head. Some pine and toast in the nose. Big sweet flavor with some ripe fruits, grapefruit especially, sweet bread and pine. Medium in body with fine carbonation. Sticky sweet and resinous bitter finish, with lots of ripe citrus, caramel, toast and grass. The balance could be better, as right now it seems a bit too sweet.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
2378,"2012-03-29",3.6,"Bottle @ home. Aroma is lovely hops, lots of amarillo I guess. Fitting malt note with some caramel and bread.
Flavour is liquorice, bread, quite dry, not as much hops as in the aroma, but still a good punch. Nice beer.","Den Haag, NETHERLANDS","dEnk"

2378,"2011-12-17",3.2,"Pours deep amber with a thin light tan head. Aroma is sweet with hints of ginger. Flavour is initially smooth and sweet with hints of butteriness, giving way to an overly aggressive pine finish. Perhaps a bit too bitter for its own good, but once the prickling bitterness subsides a pleasing liquorice finish liners, accompanied by hints of coffee.","York, North Yorkshire, ENGLAND","omegamike"

2378,"2011-11-25",3.8,"Hand-labelled, pre-release bottle from the brewery. Pours a little muddy; orange-fringed, pale chestnut with a well-retained beige collar. Aroma has a little of everything thats good; passion fruit and blackcurrant lurking beneath a pungent waft of Black Jack and pastis, tobacco. Get a nostrilful of that. Soapy, floral hop upfront blending into deeper, huskier tones; liquorice, berry skin, redcurrant, earth,nut husk, digestives. Reminds me of a US brown ale; subtly fruity, biscuity, treacherous..unable to conceal its hop allegiances. Deep hops, deep malt...and so drinkable at the strength. As Harrisoni quite rightly asserts, lovely.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"
