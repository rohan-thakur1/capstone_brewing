1082,"2016-12-27",3.5,"Clear hay color with no head. Aroma is pear and clove, with a touch of dried apricot. Flavor is sweet, with a thick and sticky mouthfeel. Pretty good overall, very festive.","Berkeley, California, USA","Aquilo"
1082,"2015-05-25",3.3,"22oz bottle. Pours a golden color with very subtle carbonation. Fermented apple aroma, touch of vinegar in the nose. Mostly sweet flavor, combination of pear and apple. Light bodied and drinkable. Decent.","Apopka, Florida, USA","smaynard6000"
1082,"2015-04-22",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 13, 2015 Initial rating 4/22/15 Hazy tan pour, low carbonation. Aroma is bosc pear with the alcohol coming forward. Like most JK ciders, this one is shockingly sweet at the first sip with huge flavor intensity -- grainy bosc pear again with that yellow pearskin. Caramel backing. Again the alcohol seems prominent, though may be fooled in part by pear elements and in part by the massive and sweet flavor; you think youre drinking something like a >10% ice wine but this stuff is 5.5%. As you get used to the sweetness, its really hard to slow down and savor this stuff. Absolutely delicious. If youre in the mood for a sweet dessert cider/perry, its amazing. 7/3/8/4/16=3.8.

Revisit 5/11/15 Upon opening, Im expecting the sweetness but unprepared for that coarse alcohol grainy pear thing that comes on way too hard, and I find myself wondering why i enjoyed this so much previously. But after a few hours this seems to settle down, and on day two is much subdued. At that point, the perry really is delicious. Maybe the trick with this one is to open one day, have a few sips, and then set it aside in the refrigerator for a day or two. Upon opening yesterday I wanted to go 3.4 at the very highest; a couple of hours later, 3.5; today it was 3.7 or so. Ill bump down to there.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
1082,"2015-04-19",3.4,"(bottle - 22 oz) Clear gold with a fizzy white head. Very sweet and lightly tart aroma. Lots of pronounced pear and apple notes. Flavor is an interesting combination of apple and pear. Sweet but not too sweet, surprisingly so. Really smooth.","Henrietta, New York, USA","zach8270"
1082,"2015-04-05",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 14, 2015 Fruity smell, more pear than apple. Golden yellow pear color. Light carbonation with no foam and no head. Fairly similar to a wine. Not nearly as bad as everyone here is rating it. It is sweet, if you dont like sweet then avoid; but I found it enjoyable.","","MIapples"
1082,"2015-02-20",3.5,"Nice aroma and taste of pear from this cider - Pours in a nice gold with a bit of carbonation - A bit too sweet and sweeter than a lot of other pear ciders Ive had - Almost like candy with this :)","California, USA","Cidertron"
1082,"2014-12-25",3.2,"Pours deep gold into a shaker. No head. Sweet pear aromas. Sweet pear juice and mild carbonation. Tastes like drinking just turned pear juice from a can. Way too sweet for me, but well made.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
1082,"2014-10-17",3.7,"Refrigerated brown bomber poured into a glass. Pours hazy golden with small white head. Aroma is sweet pear/apples, medium body, low carbonation, and some small-bubble lacing. Taste is sweat, rich pears, rich apples. This is great, by far the best perry I have had.","Charleston Area, West Virginia, USA","weihenweizen"
1082,"2014-09-20",3.2,"Tallahassee, Fl - World Market - 22 oz bomber. Murky light orange pour, very quickly fading bubbly white head. Aroma has some pear juice notes, a touch of vanilla. Pleasant flavor with some sweet vanilla notes accenting quite well on the pear notes, a touch sour apple in the finish. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Pretty decent.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
1082,"2014-08-28",2.3,"Pours a hazy golden color with a small beady white head. Nose is vinegar and sweet grut. Taste is fruity and crazy sweet and musty. Gross.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"

1082,"2014-08-22",3.6,"Bomber from The Davis Beer Shoppe. Pours gold with a slight head. Mixed apple/pear aroma. Med body or so. It is rather sweet, but both apple and pear seem discernible. Not sure what else to say other than that its pretty drinkable. Almost like theres a touch of brown sugar.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1082,"2014-08-17",2.5,"Bottle.

Head is initially very small, fizzy, fully diminishing.
Body is dark yellow.

Aroma is notes of honey, caramel apples, alcohol.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic.

Medium body, syrupy/watery texture, fizzy carbonation, lightly astringent.

Reminds more of carbonated mead than cider...very honey-ish and caramelized, and very syrupy-sweet as well. While not quite unpleasant, its tough to really enjoy.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1082,"2014-06-08",4.0,"Incredible. Just incredible. I mean, I guess its incredible if youre talking about tasting full bodied sweet pears and apples perfectly blended together and all. Honestly, I just dont like English style cider. Its watery and tastes like I went bobbing for apples in my pee. Maybe not that bad. Anyways, this shit is amazing. Get it!","Earth, Washington, USA","skoisirius"
