2526,"2017-02-06",3.4,"20170205 draught at BAB. A good white foam layer. The yellow beer is slightly cloudy. Aroma is just somewhat malt with a clear citrus like hop aroma (grapefruit). Hardly no sweetness, which give beer a thin body. Direct we will taste some sour, which is fast take over by bitter. The bitter becomes dry. Fruity of yellow grapefruit, some peach and light citrus. Not bad for a 3.3% beer.","Nootdorp, NETHERLANDS","EugeneStraver"
