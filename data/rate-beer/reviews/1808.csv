1808,"2017-06-02",4.2,"Ar: Cocoa and dark caramels; treacle, cherry, and black pepper, all at medium-low intensity; a bit of hay. Ap: Deep brown, opaque; medium-large tan head with very good retention, leaving a web of foam as it subsides but retaining a thick, frothy cap of medium and small bubbles. T: Licorice, bourbon, and tar up front; rich dark chocolate and raisins, some rum spice; black currant and treacle; bitterness is medium, very herbal; medium sweetness throughout. P: Medium-full body with medium-high carbonation; finish is medium-dry. O: Absolutely spectacular; one of the best bourbon-barrel-aged beers Ive had; all of the classic Baltic porter flavors--dark caramel, dried red fruits, and chocolate--mingle beautifully with the rich, spicy flavor of the bourbon.","Plainfield, Vermont, USA","Jabic"

1808,"2017-05-25",4.0,"16.9 oz. bottle. Poured dark brown with a short lived off white head. No lace. Strong bourbon aroma with secondary chocolate, vanilla and oak tannin. Semi sweetness on the flavor. Everything in the nose is also present on the tongue. Pick up a hint of the brown sugar the label mentions. Bourbon notes keep the chocolate and caramel from being to sweet. Oats give the body smoothness. Medium bodied. This was nice!","Wilton, New Hampshire, USA","mcox90"
1808,"2017-05-21",4.4,"From the .5 liter bottle with no date that I can see. It pours a deep dark brown to near black with a moderate tan head that fades. The Bourbon barrel aging is most evident in the aroma along with roasted dark malts, sweet dark bread, and a low to no hop profile. But if you are looking for some barrel-aged sensation you will not be disappointed with this one. The body is smooth and around medium. The sweet roasted dark malts can be found more so in the taste along with that slightly boozy barrel aging sensation that sticks with the palate from start to finish. And yet it maintains the sweetness of a good Porter. Nice job Jacks Abby.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
1808,"2017-05-10",3.9,"Bottle via IP trade. Poured a medium to slightly fuller density of pitch black under an average sized tight foamy beige head. Aroma is a bit off. Light sour dark cherry notes are beginning to creep in over the dry dark chocolate and light woody bourbon. As the beer warms the sour disappears and some roasted coconut comes out. Flavor is very dry chocolate, light vanilla bourbon, wood, burnt toast, earthy. Fuller body, starts off syrupy but eventually it turns into an almost harsh dryness on the end. Nice once the sourness disappears.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"

1808,"2016-05-12",3.7,"Draught at the brewery, 4/23/16.For the record, my friend and I both had our own separate 6oz pours (the largest size) of every variant. We could have split a sampler rack of 2ozers, but thats not how I role.Light bourbon in the nose, very light. Nice. More wood and light bread and bitter chocolate. Liquorous, but not boozey, at least not at the start. Spicy whiskey notes are enjoyable and balanced, with a touch of coffee and more chocolate. Really nicely even and spread out amongst different aromas in the nose. Its neither too malty, spicy nor roasty.Light vanilla, some very dry bread and bitter chocolate form a vacuum, body-wise and it seems just a bit thin and over-attenuated at times. But nutty tannins as well as some caramel build, especially with warming. Spicey and quite whiskey/bourbon-like though without any dominance in that category. I like that it ends on the dry side with a slick-to-chewy texture and ample, engaging, low carbonation, to-boot. Good stuff and not overdone on the barrel, as with all of the recent variants. Im willing to bet the coffee and vanilla versions are more balanced now, as well, though I havent tried them recently. Fun to try alongside the port, double and regular versions. But the candy and brandy-character of the port version was the winner for me (as is usually my preference). Good stuff.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1808,"2015-06-05",3.7,"Draft at Bierstube during a Philly Beer Week event. Tulip. Opaque black pour with a tuft of khaki foam that left an impressive sheet of lace at the top (though someone next to me was drinking the same thing but there was no lace at all). Very lactic Baltic Porter. Big liquorice flavors. Dark roasted malts. Charred oak planks. Expected coffee/chocolate flavors are present but not defining. Burnt carob cake. Some Scotch Ale flavors - vegamite, artichokes, celery hearts and peat. Proved to be a clear dark brown color by the bottom of the glass. Thinking that this beer starts off great and could prove fantastic if it had some more interesting Stout notes (leather, vinyl, charcoal, cigarettes). It finishes too abruptly. Suspect that it us the lager base smoothing out too many extraordinary flavors.

It is heavy on the oak and booze up front with some vanilla and brown sugar in the finish followed by more of that woody oak character in a dry finish.

1808,"2014-11-02",4.0,"Dark sienna, almost black and mostly opaque pour. Earthy, leathery oak and booze barrel initial nose. Mineral notes and acrid green pepper skins. Chocolate and wooden sherry-like oxidized colors are consistently present, though in a way somewhat befitting the style in my opinion. Its earthy depth, in burnt caramel and bonfire and bark, and warmth of composition are also appropriate. Alcohol is a little overbearing; there is a surprising absence of dark fruit character, but for some Concord grape.

Super dense, Caribbean rum high grade cacao flavor. The bourbon flavor is never overwhelming here, presenting its vanilla, toasted coconut and butter toffee notes in slow parade. Dried and dark fruit flavors of black mission fig and black cherry, though quiet, are more informative here than in the aroma. Maple syrup and dry oak remain prevalent; still earth and leather and forest themed.

OIly mouthfeel with a tiny prickle of carbonation and thats all. The rich malt layering and balance of tempered heat makes for a luxurious but highly drinkable texture. It is often easy to forget that this is even a barrel-aged beer, and its stylistic integrity independent of this fact is firm. Relatively clean finish with a lingering effect of oak, molasses, sherry. Never stunning, but thoroughly excellent.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

1808,"2014-05-08",2.3,"500mL Bottle. I realize that my rating of this beer may come across as blasphemy, but I think theres some real homer, crowdthink going on with Jacks Abby beers lately, as Ive noticed some detectable brewing flaws that should have been commented on by other raters. I for one, dont think this is a very good beer. Noses heavy in booze, booze, booze, hot and raw bourbon. On the tongue, theres a complete lack of baltic porter base, instead bourbon alcohols ride over a sweet base and are joined by a distinct isovaleric, cheesy hop dominance, paired with a little tar and maple syrup. Out of balance from the barrel and marred by a distinct mid-palate cheesy hop note, this is not good barrel work and does nothing to improve the base beer.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Into a pint glass.
The appearance is a dark brown/black colored body with a fingers worth of head that quickly dies and leaves a film of lacing sticking to the glass.
The smell has chocolate malts, light coffee, dark fruits (plum, raisins and figs - more or less...??).
The taste is sweet and bitter at different times through the previously mentioned flavors with added vanilla and bourbon, dry sweet aftertaste and finish.
On the palate its about a medium and smooth, wow, how smooth, probably one of the smoothest Baltic Porters Ive ever had. Alcohol is hidden well. Carbonation is right on the mark

1808,"2013-09-21",3.9,"Bottle at Bruces, thanks to Leighton. It pours dark brown with a tiny bubbly off-white head. The nose is soft roast, toast, cocoa, caramel, coconut, wood and sweet vanilla. The taste is roasted malt, toast, ash, liquorice, decent bitterness, caramel, burnt notes, spice, meatiness, chocolate, vanilla, toasted coconut and light alcohol (but not that of 10%!) with a dry, roasty finish. Well hidden-alcohol. Nice bitter-sweet aspect. Rather delicious!","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"

1808,"2013-09-02",3.7,"500 ml bottle shared by bsuedekum- thanks again, Blake! Pours a deep coffee brown with a beige head. Aroma of chocolate, bourbon, coconut, earth, oats, and nuts. The flavor is the same, with more oak and toasted brown sugar. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a warming mouthfeel. Good, but didnt blow me away.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

1808,"2013-05-29",4.0,"Opened my last bottle with mishuggah and thetomg after the Movement Festival in Detroit. Probably not the greatest time for a tick, but gonna give it a go regardless. Poured into a non-descript plastic cup. Pours black in color with the smallest amount of creme colored head, not even a half fingers worth. The nose is comprised of bourbon, toffee, chocolate, and vanilla. The flavor follows the nose, with the bourbon and toffee being more prominent. Moderate mouthfeel with some general creaminess and moderate carbonation. The finish lingers nicely with just a touch of booze.  Another really nice offering from Jacks Abby. Very drinkable barrel aged lager, would definitely like to have more bottles of this.","Illinois, USA","Dunt"

1808,"2013-05-27",4.0,"I picked up all three barrel aged variations at Julios Liquors on 4 May 2013. I am now comparing Side- by Side- by- Side.  Deep dark black pour, no light breaks through even when held to the sun. Nose gives off a nice oak, burnt wood and molasses. Awesome flavor of roasted malts, chocolate, sweet mellow bourbon and vanilla booze notes. Alcohol warmth lingers down the throat. The 10% is harsh at all. Its an unbelievable barrel aged beer that downs down really easy. Unreal brew!","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

1808,"2013-04-28",3.5,"Bottle.  Liked the tap version of the base beer better than the barrel aged version.  Clean complex character of the base beer somewhat muffled by a doughed bourbon vanilla presence.  Still good.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
1808,"2013-04-27",4.3,"Ahh... Lager. 

Pours really, really dark for a lager... Even when held directly up to a light bulb only yields a little brown around the edges, not the usual red. Intense aromas of bourbon and oak. Rally meaty. Very round taste... Oaky and flavorful, while retaining a slight sweetness and a little boozy punch. Its quite good. Finishes with a lingering bourbon aftertaste that sticks in your mouth for ages. Nice. 
Another world class beer from what is quickly becoming my favorite brewery.","Victor, New York, USA","MacBoost"
1808,"2013-04-20",4.4,"Pours a deep umber black color with a two finger of mocha foam head that sticks nicely. On the nose its rich sweet chocolate, coconut cream and nice vanilla and roasted malts. The palate is dialed into perfection when it comes to bourbon flavor... Perfect mouthfeel, smooth, creamy rich yet highly drinkable too. This beer is really speaking to me. Sweet, smooth boozy...

1808,"2013-04-04",4.2,"NO WAY! 500 mL bottle purchased from Learys that I snatched for an excusable $5.50. To snifter it pours a deep rusted dark brown (black when up held to the light) with a trim, light yellow mustard head. Aromas of roasted pecans, raisins, booze, whiskey oak, lemongrass, sorghum molasses, cotton, black liquorice, American hops, Dutched chocolate, caraway seeds, and carob. Tastes simply astonishing: starts off with notes finely-ground espresso, dark chocolate/cocoa powder, and vanilla beans. From there, Im getting a lot of liquorice, carob, leather, and birch bark. Cocoa nibs, lager yeast, elderberry by swallow. Has an undercurrent of whiskey and booze. Unbelievably enjoyable.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"
1808,"2013-04-02",4.2,"Pours black into a tulip. Off-white head with medium retention recedes to hug rim. Sweet chocolate, vanilla and oak aromas. Thick with chocolate and bourbon upfront turning hot in the vanilla, espresso and oak finish. Nice.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
1808,"2013-03-31",4.0,"500ml bottle. Pours dark black with very little head. Bourbon notes are very subtle along with the more pronounced malt and vanilla flavors. Very tasty brew, one of Jacks best efforts to date.",", Massachusetts, USA","BroSpud"
1808,"2013-03-30",4.5,"March, 2013 vintage. 500ml bottle into a tulip glass.

A - Pours a dark brown body thats bordering on black. Lets a little bit of light through but very little. Three fingers of super dense and creamy mocha foam upon pouring. Settles into thick edging. Sticky lacing with some solid retention.

S - Loads of sweet and rich milk chocolate up front give way to some light anise and roasted malts. Finishes with subtle but smooth vanilla and bourbon. A bit of alcohol heat.

T - Follows the nose with a predominately chocolaty flavor with light anise and roasted malts. Bourbon is again pretty modest here with some light vanilla, oak, and butterscotch. Alcohol is pretty noticeable but very pleasant.

M - Probably the best part of this beer. Not sure what kind of voodoo magic these guys pull, but the beer is rich and creamy...but at the same time its light and highly drinkable. Really fantastic.

O - This is a very delicious beer. I know Baltic porters tend to warp the line between ales and lagers, but I adore anything that Jacks Abby does and this is no exception. The fact that they are experimenting with barrels now is just too awesome. Plus the $6 price tag is super reasonable.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

1808,"2012-07-21",3.8,"Tap at Meadhall for the Anniversary party.  Snifter  Very stil black pour with no head. Bourbon, roast, and faint caramel and vanilla make the nose. Taste is quite good. I know it's bourbon but the flavor reminds me more of dark rum.  Big time roast with just the right amount of booze. Not as much licorice as other Baltic Porters which works just fine. Sweetened black coffee flavor stays in the mouth Long with some alcohol warmth in the back of the throat. Nice beer...best in show tonight so far.

A light fruitiness in the background.  The palate also features the bourbon nicely along with some notes of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt.  Fairly simple and straight forward, but really nice.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
