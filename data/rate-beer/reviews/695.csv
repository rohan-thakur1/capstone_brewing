695,"2011-11-26",3.9,"Bottle: &nbsp Dark brown, deep caramel hues, large foamy light beige head, nice lacing. &nbsp Lovely bourbon, 

oak, and vanilla on the nose. &nbsp Hard to tell if its a Scotch Ale, Barley Wine, Doppelbock or something else as the 

barrel aging has been fairly strong on this one. &nbsp Somewhat peaty on the tongue. &nbsp All of the standard 

bourbon, oak, and vanilla notes as well. &nbsp Not as strong on the tongue as on the nose. &nbsp Picking up a little 

bit of campfire or charred wood. &nbsp Minor, but its there. &nbsp Finishes peaty, stronger Scotch Ale than at the 

start. &nbsp Lingering barrel aged notes. &nbsp A little spritzy on the tongue. &nbsp Clean, enjoyable. &nbsp Thanks

695,"2010-10-22",3.7,"750 ml bottle opened after a house cleaning. Courtesy of TheEpeeist. Pours a well carbonated dark brown, opaque, perhaps some lighter edges, a loose bubbled moderate sized tannish head, laces well and stays decent sized. Aromas are a big dose of Bourbon, warm heat, wet oak and vanilla, toffee and caramel, toast, light peaty smoke, sweet biscuits, toast. Nice, rich, a bit heavy on the barrel, but so far so good. Initial is medium bodied, pretty barrel thinned, warming bourbon and wet oak, vanilla, sweet toffee and caramel, biscuits and toast, a decent toastiness, light smoke grows on the palate. Warmth, heat grows. A touch of dark dried fruit, faint, the sweetness and toast take hold though, with pretty strong barrel element. Some flourishes of dark bakers chocolate move in, decent bitterness. Finish is quite nice, bitter and bourbon, sweetness. This really is quite nice, grows on me, only qualm might be it being a bit too barreled (or rather, thinned by said barrel).","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
695,"2010-03-29",3.3,"Backlog rating. Bottle from Capones, Norristown. Pours a dingy dark brown, with a body thats quite still. Hmmm. Faint carbonation at the outset, but its gone too quickly. Bourbon notes are quite understated and the base beer (which Ive not had on its own) smells quite mellow. Thin body, increasingly so over time. Sorta ashy and washed out scotch ale, and I felt that the barrel notes actually helped it a bit.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
695,"2009-12-10",4.2,"Brown pour.  Aroma of bourbon, coconut, vanila, toffee, oak, peat and some agave nectar.  Flavor is full of great bourbon notes, lots of vanilla and caramel and some light peat/wood.  Damn fine!!","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"

A little bit of chocolate in the flavor which is a nice touch.  It is still very dry and leafy oak.   Its pretty easy drinking cause its dry but has plenty of flavor.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

695,"2009-08-11",3.8,"750mL bottle. Pours very deep brown with a bit of a reddish hue, topped with a moderate sized tan head that fades fairly quickly. Really enticing aroma; vanilla and peat meld nicely in the forefront and are complimented by caramel, oak, brown sugar, and some alcohol. Barrel seems to dominate the flavor a bit. Vanilla, alcohol, and bourbon are the primary flavors, with chocolate, peat and brown sugar in the background. A bit thinner bodied than expected. Not bad, but it seems boozier than its 7%.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","kkearn"
695,"2009-07-28",4.3,"750ml bottle. Wow. I wasnt expecting to like this as much as I did. Pours a red brown with a creamy light brown head. Massive vanilla caramel nose with some light hints of cherry pits, and bourbon. Flavor is fantastically balanced. The barrel is just perfectly integrated. Seamless transition from chocolate, caramel, vanilla, bourbon, light cherry, and wood. Very very drinkable and tasty. This beer is really great.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"

695,"2009-07-14",3.9,"Bottle Pours hazy and very dark (a glimpse of burnt orange when held up to light) with a mid-sized, creamy, khaki head. Excellent retention. The rich aroma is a mélange of coconut, vanilla, sourmash, caramel, oak and toffee. Medium to full-bodied with very tingly carbonation.

695,"2009-07-12",3.4,"From a bottle, courtesy of hopscotch. Pours a dark reddish brown with a nice fuzzy tan head with a little lacing. Nose is nice bourbon, vanilla, wood, rich caramel and some fruitiness. The barrel seemed to take away the peat notes from the standard version. Rather thin in the mouth, low carb, a nice caramel, touch of roast and the bourbon is much more restrained in the flavor.","San Francisco, California, USA","cmillward"
695,"2009-07-10",4.2,"Bottle, thank you hopscotch!  Fantastic nose, woody with a touch of smoky whiskey and dark malts, a little raisiny roast, burnt figs.  Very dark brown color. Mildly sweet up front but a thinned up palate keeps it from being cloying. Lightly roasty with an oaky semi-dry finish.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
695,"2009-07-09",3.6,"Courtesy hopscotch. Pours a transparent, dark cola brown color with a small, foamy, light brown head. Settling in to a thin foam, the crown leaves minimal spots behind. The nose shows a nice amount of peaty smoke amidst dark caramel and hints of cocoa malt. The bourbon is smooth and woody, not overly warm. Flavors start with that same malt baseline of caramel, chocolate and peat, oaky vanilla and warm bourbon showing well. The body is a little thin and perhaps a little boozy, but not too bad. Good brew, but not mind blowing.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

695,"2009-02-19",3.3,"765ml bottle from trade with HopDog. Thanks Steve! Pours almost black, a bit of light coming through...thin beige, yellowish head. What the hell? This literally tastes like vodka and coke...maybe a smidge of malt...but it really doesnt taste like beer to me. Really smooth and easy to drink. Light mouthfeel and aftertaste like a shot of vodka. This beer is really weird...It really does not taste like beer to me. There is no doubt in my mind that vodka was involved in the brewing of this...I dont know...its somewhat enjoyable...but I was really let down by this one.","Spring Hill, Florida, USA","BrianDorry55"

Gets better as it warms, but kind of underwhelming.","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"

Aroma is sweet upfront with tons of caramelized malts, crystal and some munich toast in there as well- tons of fruity esters- apple, fig, raisin, date- bourbon is in moderate proportion and vanilla hades a bit.  More sweet malts throughout the flavor, a bit woody and dirty in the middle more fruits, candied sugar, oak and hints of vanilla- bourbon isnt out of control- light earthy tobacco int eh end as it warms.

695,"2009-01-10",4.1,"Thanks go out to a couple of wonderful Pennsylvian BA for this one Dim and Deuane (hey D&D I stopped there for coffee this morning). I poured my bottle into my Sam Addams Pint glass and watched as it produced a good two fingers worth of tan head that settled to a nice lace. The body was black in color with some nice reddish/brown highlights.

The first whiff I got was of peat followed by some bourbon and malts. This brew has a really nice nose true to it style but more pronounced do to the barrel ageing.

The flavors are close to the nose sweet malts are the first thing that I notice. The woodiness and earthiness are some of the best I have sampled in a scotch style. They help bring the malts into check and keep this brew from being too sweet. The body is medium and smooth with ample carbonation to keep it interesting.

This brew is going down amazingly well. I can tell as I continue to finish the bottle that this one may contain some alcohol but not from the nose or taste. Its more like the flushness in my cheeks LOL
A great brew I would seek it out and I am glad I have one to age a bit.","Skowhegan, Maine, USA","Pastor"
