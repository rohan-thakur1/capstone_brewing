2172,"2016-11-30",3.1,"Couldnt get to Gotland, so I made some myself, based on Charlie Papazians recipe. I used cherrywood smoked malt because apparently birchwood smoked isnt readily commercially available. Next time Ill smoke my own malt over birch. I got more bitterness from the juniper than actual flavor, and the smoke notes were mellower than I had hoped for. Was drinking too much on brew day and forgot to take a gravity reading, so I have no idea what the ABV is. I suspect its lower than I was shooting for, as this was my first all grain brew. Overall, I enjoyed this beer, but I imagine it can be done far better, and, since I have a whole pound of bread yeast in the freezer and a juniper plant in the front yard, I plan to do it a few more times until I get it right.","Pennsylvania, USA","EvanFriend"

2172,"2015-07-22",2.8,"Bottle. Did not know this was an entry on ratebeer. Had it at least twice, one with omhper snd once with larsniclas. I remember it as very murky, sour and smoked, fruity and with dough. More Interesting than tasty, but not totally bad.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rlgk"
2172,"2015-06-01",2.8,"April 25, 2015. Plastic jerry can, shared by omhper, thanks! 
Very cloudy yellow/grey. Aroma is smoked meat, peaty wood, juniper, slight phenolic plastic notes. Taste is somewhat sweet, slight sour with peat and some plastic notes. Medium bodied, flat. Taste much better than it looks...","Stockholm, SWEDEN","hackobock"
2172,"2015-05-23",3.2,"[4/25/15] Jerrycan sample at a tasting at omhpers place in Tyresö. Thanks omhper, AndySnow and hackobock for sharing great beers! Muddy brownish gray. Nice smoky aroma with a sourish fruit note. Sourish flavor, fruity, smoky, with a bit of spiciness, and wood. Medium-bodied. Not at its prime, as its not supposed to be sour, but still not bad and interesting. And I love the big plastic jerrycan it came out of!","Tel Aviv, ISRAEL","DSG"
2172,"2015-03-03",2.8,"Bottle (Thanks Omhper) - Cloudy and murky amber. Beech, tar, ash and some fruity notes in the aroma. Tangy, smoky and rather harsh taste with beech, tar and some biscuity notes.","Uppsala, SWEDEN","SaintMatty"
2172,"2015-02-21",3.1,"Bottled by omhper from farm st. Bol. Cloudy yellow body with no foam. Aroma has light roasty, almost bacon like profile, little bit yeasty, otherwise pretty clean. Taste has an overall roasty bacony character, with malty sweetness upfront, light acidic after taste, quite refreshing. Low to none bitterness. Little bit yeasty. I thought there will be more juniper. Body is medium, flat carbonation. Would go wonderful with Slovaks haluky :)","CZECH REPUBLIC","mmahut"

2172,"2014-04-06",3.1,"Several different samples at homebrew festivals throughout the years. Usually from a plastic container, sometimes from a cornelius keg. Usually a murky, brown liquid with minimal head. Aroma of wood, bread, smoke, ham, juniper and sometimes a little fruity esters from the yeast. The taste is usually light sweet and very light bitter with a spicy smokiness and bready malt. Light to medium bodied with very low or no carbonation. A bit hard to rate several beers at once.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","VsXsV"
2172,"2013-10-24",3.0,"Tried many versions of Dricka/Dricke/Drikku over the years. Some have been bottled, many have been served from plastic buckets or containers of various volumes. So how to rate something from many different brewers with so different character? Well more often than not have been dark brown with little to no head. Mainly sweet, malty, smoked, some juniper scent and taste. Medium to smooth mouthfeel, with low to very low CO2, usually no bitterness. Some have been rather bad, some very nice. Most have been pretty drinkable, but many others do not agree with me.","Mölndal, SWEDEN","gnoff"
2172,"2013-04-22",3.4,"How do you rate something with so many varieties. Quite easily available on Gotland. A lot of different variants, some commercial, most not. Usually brownish colour with no visible head. Aroma and flavour of juniper, spices.","Huddinge, SWEDEN","AndySnow"
2172,"2012-02-07",3.6,"Well...how do you describe this...
In the ""old days"" at Medeltidsveckan, you you get a sample here and there for a litte coin. Then it was not allowed to sell it, but they gave you one every time you bought  bun ( that you gave back).
Nowdays you can get a sample if you know any farmer at Gotland. It usually contains juniper and have a hazy orange something colour. The most experienced farmers make really good Gotlandsdricku. After working there some years I have tasted some really good :-)","Halden, NORWAY","Cunningham"
2172,"2010-09-29",3.1,"Different brews can vary wildly in style. From deep brown and tart to light and Wit-like. Very much an acquired taste and generally not appreciated by anyone except the islanders themselves. I have a story Id like to share. Back in the days of the cold war I was doing military service on the island. On new years eve about 20 or so of us had to stay while all the others went to celebrate with friends and family. Somehow one of the locals managed to conjure up about 40 liters of ""dricke"". We made a campfire on the beach looking out over a wintery Baltic sea and had one hell of a party. The evening ended with everyone not from the island (except me) being very sick. That is dricke for you, dangerous stuff! ",", SWEDEN","ulvbane"
2172,"2008-04-04",3.4,"From a plastic bottle.  Generously shared by cquiroga.  Cloudy, light caramel colored pour with a wispy 

head of off-white.  Fruity nose of pears, apples, and coconut milk, along with hints of muscat grapes and musty 

leather.  Lots of fruity esters and a honey like sweetness provide an almost ""juice""-like base, funked up with 

some barnyard notes and peppery phenols.  Medium light bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel with a gentle, 

tingling effervescence.  Sweet white grape and waterchestnut flavors up front, along with some ripened pear.  A 

mild smokey nuttiness tries to peek in, but is drowned out by the light fruits and horsey funk.  The wildness of 

the beer seems to have taken over some of the other spice nuances; it would be enlightening to try a fresh example 

side-by-side.  Thanks for the rare treat, Chris!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
2172,"2008-02-18",3.4,"Bottle @ Dr. Bills.  The brewer name kicks ass.  Poured a hazy amber color with no head.  Dry spiced aroma with notes of fruit and leather.  The flavor was tart and fruity.  Big leather and notes of pear.  Light tingle of carbonation on the tongue.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
2172,"2007-03-23",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 24, 2007 Courtesy of omhper and drank as a horizontal alongside Jackelsdricka for comparison.  Pours mahogany and more or less still with no bubbles and only a hint of tingliness on the tongue.  Smells strongly of juniper with hints of spruce, birch and mineral water.  Taste is like a gin might be if it were a fermented beverage with loads of juniper and lots of booziness.  Some hints of smoke are also present.  Palate is very thick and reminds me of the heavy mineral waters of Europe.  Finishes along the lines of sassafras.  Very different from everything else I tried during this tasting that included sahtis, and lots of traditional Scandanavian beers.  If sahti and lambic are the grandparents of beer, this is their great grand parent.  Thanks again for this rare treat!","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
2172,"2007-03-21",3.4,"Plastic bottle from omhper (big thanks, Ill try getting you some new sahtis for this one!). Hazy nutbrown colour, no head. Aroma is freshly cut juniperwood along with some spiced and xylitolish hints. Flavour is the same. Very refreshing! The bottle got lots of preassure in it so while letting a bit of it out, I also poured a small sample. Rest of the bottle is to be saved for PBF2007. Hides the alcohol very well!","Vasa, FINLAND","oh6gdx"
2172,"2006-08-17",3.2,"Fresh sample, brewed by my friends mom for a wedding. Sampled in a very traditional plastic mug ;-) Hazy orange, no head but residual bubbles. Huge aroma, yeasts, esters, fruit (not dark malty types) and a slight almost lambic-like funkiness. Taste is upfront sour, yeasty with a definite alcohol presence. Not sure if I can pick out the juniper.. Palate is rich, sticky with a loong finish. There is no carbonation. This is great stuff, really happy to have tried it.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","lgklotet"

2172,"2004-11-24",2.8,"Sampled with omhper, tiggmtl, MartinT, muzzlehatch, and Rastacouere in Montreal.  Thanks to Per for this amazing sample.  This I believe is from Burs (not sure if that is the some farmer, or a part of gotland).  Aroma is very smoked.  Smells like campfires/burning tires.  Vinous and very interesting aroma.  Hazy amber/honey color with a very small white head.  Smoked to start.  Fruity, campfirey, and leathey.  Thin bodied.  Quite strange and I am sure it requires a specific palate to enjoy this sub-style.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
2172,"2004-11-23",2.7,"Burning wood, hugely fuity (peach), smoked aroma. Opaque orange-tan coloured, heavy, still and viscous looking with no head at all. Charred blackened, salted peach flavour. Palate is oily, heavy and still. A very interesting experiment. Im glad to have had the chance to try this, but after the initial few sips, I found this difficult to consume.

Bright pale orange, no carbonation...smoky, funky cheeses and fruitwoods in the nose, wildy woody and farmy...simply fantastic aromas!  Very flat, smoky peaches and apricots in the flavor...the thin body allows the heavy smokiness and charred character to overwhelm.  Difficult to drink even a small sample, nonetheless its really amazing to be able to try this!","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
2172,"2004-11-20",3.6,"Burs version. Hazy orange apperance, almost still looking. Huge smokey aroma. Unique leather/juniper match, extremely meaty. Floral and wheaty (in the small acidity) feel. Apricot and peach pie flavors, a fieldish campfire on the tongue, this is strikingly tasty and demands all your concentration. Very weird as it has this farmhouse character combined with the deep smokiness of strict Bamberg styles. Thin-medium body, low carbonation. This style is a must seek!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2172,"2004-11-20",3.7,"(From Burs) : Sitting in a tree inhaling the intense smoke of a fruit-harboring wood cabin whose fire has just been extinguished by torrential rain...Very humid and woody smoke, impossible to escape from (Im not necessarily trying to), with a garrulous fruitiness of junipers (real) and apricots (fictive)...Honey impersonations and earthy bitterness rising in the end...Perhaps smokier than a Schlenkerla, an incredibly memorable experience which I hope to relive again...Immense thanks Per!!...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
2172,"2004-08-29",2.5,"An unclear brown beer with no head. The aroma is very smoked and with notes of rope and oranges. The flavor is sweet and is very smoked before ending on a dry note. Too simple a flavor.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
2172,"2004-08-21",3.4,"Thanks Per, again a very unusual beer.   Cloudy brown color, it looks like a fresh glass of apple cider.  No head what so ever.

2172,"2002-03-24",4.3,"Reddish brown and somewhat cloudy in both color and appearance. Creamy, well maintained off white head. Sharp burnt/smoky aroma and flavor with a pronounced alcohol mouthfeel.

2172,"2002-02-20",3.6,"Update 2002-02-20: The new batch I tried was more fresh, somewhat sparkling from the still ongoing fermentation in the bottle, and beautifully hazy. There are definitely some smokey juniper flavour. The main characteristics of the beer seem intact from the last batch I tried though.
Older comments:
This is actually the same version as Oakes tried. It was made on a farm in Stånga on central Gotland.
Nut-brown. Non carbonated, sweetish and soft, some bitterness, restrained smokiness, as compared to the few other versions Ive tried.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
2172,"2001-09-09",3.6,"Still, as per the style;  muddy dark amber (not very attractive, but true to style); aroma: smoke, pear, vanilla, lots of malt.  Palate: smokey up front, followed by sweet malts & a late hint of juniper.  A lot of rich fruitiness comes through as well, and it finishes slightly tart - complex and delicious.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
