2966,"2017-02-04",2.7,"On tap @ Beer Revolution. Another craft malt liquor, and this one is high boost. Clear yellow beer with some white foam. Tastes like corn pops mixed with proper malt liquor, actually. Very sweet and grainy but also has that cereal and booze quality that a high quality malt liquor would. Actually does have a little bit of a hop bitterness to it...slightly husky, too. Fun to try, but thats about it for me.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
