2264,"2016-07-02",4.0,"One of last years batches, bottle bought from a private collector, cheers Frank! Pale greyish beige, dense, very moussy, medium thick head leaving thick membranes of lacing around the glass, misty translucent bronze robe with pinkish-vermillion hue, dark dead yeast particles throughout. Powerful, perfumey, refinedly sweet bouquet of caramel candy, Belgian chocolates with liqueur filling, sweet cognac, vanilla, marzipan and even nougat, fudge, ruby port, cake dough, candied banana, kahlúa, Christmas pudding, dried ginger, lots of wet oak, honey, dry earth, hazelnut oil, candied cherries, marmelade and a volatile hint of fresh paint. Noble candied sweetness in the onset, pralines alongside residual brown sugar, banana and raisin hints beautifully balanced with an underlying dim sourishness, finely tingling carbonation. Supple, mouth-filling body, very caramelly and toffeeish, even honeyish malt sweetness with a nutty edge somewhere, while the intense but well-positioned candied sweetness from the onset continues; finish becomes ever more dry, adding lovely woody tannins balancing out the sweetness, as well as a big glow of warming, liqueurish and indeed brandy-like alcohol, which, however emphatic it may be, manages to refrain from astringency and instead adds flavor and drought. Herbal and earthy hop bitterish accent shows up too and woody and caramelly flavors line the throat after swallowing. Again, the wood effects made an otherwise overly sweet quad a whole lot better, though the sweetness - enhanced by the cognac, which has a basic sweetness by itself - is still a bit much here; Id prefer some of the drier (and non-cognac) versions of this magnificent trappist beer series over this particular edition. Still: wonderfully rich and opulent dessert beer, as any great quad should be.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

2264,"2015-12-05",4.2,"Robe brune, reflets ambrés, mousse peu persistante. Nez puissant et complexe sur la vanille, la fourrure, les épices douces, le caramel, le chocolat au lait. Bouche à lattaque élégante, finement boisée, milieu de bouche crémeux et longue finale à la fois fraîche et lactée. Une très belle bière de méditation au coin du feu.","Mons, BELGIUM","Ysok02"
2264,"2015-11-17",4.2,"Pours a small frothy off-white head that quickly disappeares. Body is mohogany brown.
Contains typical La Trappe Quadrupel aromas with additions of cognac, wood tannins and vanilla. Fruity in the beginning, boozy in the middle and soft in the finish. 
Complexity in flavors. Creamy and pleasant mouthfeel.
Another great Oak Aged Quadrupel from La Trappe but ot the best one Ive had. Perhaps time will improve it even more.","NETHERLANDS","langeveld12"
2264,"2015-11-16",2.7,"375 ml bottle at home. Pours deep amber red-brown with a thin off-white grey-ish head. Nutty aroma, wood and alcohol, quite harsch. Subtlety of other batches is a bit gone - sadly. Big body but a bit watery and way too much alcohol imo. Taste is bland, nutty. A bit of a bummer this one.","Linden, BELGIUM","gEUS"

2264,"2015-11-02",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 4, 2016 Fles gekocht bij de kloosterwinkel bij abdij De Koningshoeven, Batch 21. Licht troebel bruin mahonie kleurig bier met een kleine beige schuimkraag. Verfijnd en zacht aroma van: karamel, rozijnen, walnoot, amandel, eikenhout, vanille en cognac. Krachtige smaak met zoete tonen van karamel, gedroogd fruit, rood fruit, snoepgoed, verder houttannines, vanille, amandel, cognac, en licht gerookte invloeden. Volle zachte body met lichte carbonatie, en een verwarmende alcoholische afdronk van cognac en eikenhout. Wederom een geweldige batch quadrupel Oak Aged, hoewel ik de #20 net iets intenser en nog iets complexer van smaak vond. Ik kijk nu al uit naar de volgende batch. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone","Waalwijk, NETHERLANDS","Batavi"

2264,"2015-10-23",4.6,"375 ml. bottle. BBF 09-2040 (seriously, I have tried enough aged batches of OA to think that is a really ridiculous suggestion, these age really well, first one are already going clearly downhill at this point, I dont believe that this one is going to make it 25 years but brewers just keep putting insane dates like this & I suppose people keep buying it). One more side-note, this one has a real cork, am I insane or did batches 1  18 have plastic corks. Deep red brown amber, quickly gone light brown head. Nose is delicious vanilla wood, red fruits, strawberry, big sweet candy & oak, big sweetness + red fruits, very nice. Taste is reasonably big on alcohol, spirit, wood, huge overripe fruits, ripe strawberry, raisins, sweet red grapes, big red fruits, finish is light candy, light complimentary alcohol. Lacks a bit of balance but the taste is really interesting & nice, love the big candy & red fruit (including strawberry). Almost a touch watery body. Body is not perfect but I really love these flavours. Some really interesting & surprising notes in a great way. Really like it.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
