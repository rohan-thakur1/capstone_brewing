4377,"2017-06-14",4.1,"Bottle from Merchants. Aroma is bourbon barrel, roasted malt, bready, chocolate, not too boozy but enough of that bourbon aroma there to make it good. Appearance is dark dark brown, light brown head, Id say its clear but opaque. Taste is very nice, bourbon, roasted malt, milk chocolate, barrel, bready, not boozy but bourbony flavor, lovely. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy body, light carbonation, bourbon and roasted malt aftertaste. Overall, this is dangerously smooth and the bourbon does not overtake the Schwarzbier but compliments it greatly. Well done.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"

4377,"2016-01-31",4.1,"Appearance is dark and smells of chocolate and bourbon. It has a rich coffee and malt taste and the bourbon takes it to a new level. Very nice brew.","Michigan, USA","beerbaron90"

4377,"2015-12-30",3.9,"Pour out of 750 mL bottle, dark black pour with tan head, aroma brought notes of dark chocolate, bourbon, roast, hints of dark fruit, hints of coffee and slight vanilla. Taste was a mix of nice dark chocolate, coffee, and bourbon, more roasted malt comes with a hint of burnt notes, slight dark fruit, finishing slightly sweet, slightly bitter.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
4377,"2015-12-24",3.9,"Bottle: The aroma consists of light-moderate chocolate, lighter vanilla, roast, nuts, mild bourbon, and oak. It pours a dark brown with no transparency and minimal orange highlights. It has a two finger khaki head that eventually settles to a thick film outlined by a thicker ring. There are some dripping rings left behind with each sip. The flavor starts with moderate chocolate and caramel. There is some light roasted malt in the middle. The finish has light-moderate vanilla, light nuts, bourbon, and oak. Its medium bodied with mild carbonation and a somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Overall...a really nice barrel aged beer. The bourbon isnt overpowering leaving behind what I assume is solid base beer. Ive never had the non-barrel aged version.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
4377,"2015-12-21",4.1,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but was just released this month. Listed at 8.5% on the bottle. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted dark bread, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, light dark fruit/herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of roast/bready malt and moderate bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted dark bread, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, light dark fruit/herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, dark bread, molasses, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready malt and moderate bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish.  Very clean on lager flavors with minimal yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/silky, and slightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial Schwarzbier style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready malt and moderate bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth and easy to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

4377,"2015-03-12",3.4,"Tap at The Oak. Thin black pour with almost no head. Aroma is all bourbon but its pretty nice. Taste brings lots of bourbon and oak but remains fairly smooth. Thin body makes it go down easy but also makes it seem a tad watery.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
4377,"2014-08-19",4.3,"Sampled at the brewery. Bourbon and ginger ale nose. Dark black-brown clear with thin head. Medium body with smooth carbonation. Like watery bourbon and ginger ale. Big flavors with light chocolate notes. Huge bourbon presence, rum raisin ice cream. Warming and delicious.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"
4377,"2014-08-16",3.5,"From notes. On tap at Perrin on August 15. The pour is a thin black with a ring of large bubbly foam head and spotty lace. The aroma is mostly bourbon with a light malt to it barrel, bourbon and not a whole lot going on. The flavor is much if the same. There is a woody dominance with a strong bourbon barrel character. There is a little vanilla, but it's all woody bourbon. The mouth feel is quite thin, and there is minimal carbonation, so it's kinda meh. The aftertaste is a little strange. It's woody, but not bourboney, with a light body, and a soft quick aftertaste

4377,"2014-03-05",3.4,"tap. Near black with small head. Smooth black ale revved up with bourbon barrel aging. Slightly hot from the booze. Nothing subtle at all about this one.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"
4377,"2013-09-05",2.6,"People next to me assumed it was a stout. Does have a lighter hue when you look around the edge of the glass. Bourbon is not overwhelming. Feels like they used a higher end barrel than some other bourbon aged beers that I have had lately. I enjoyed it better as it warmed. At the end sometimes I got that bourbon alcohol feeling I am not a fan of, but bourbon fans enjoy. It is growing on me.","Salt Lake City, Utah, USA","fakebeersnob"
4377,"2013-09-02",3.9,"Draft at Perrin. Near black with a dark beige head. Bourbon, vanilla and caramel. Oily with dark, dried fruits. A bit boozy.","Michigan, USA","Mittenator"
4377,"2013-08-15",3.8,"Tap sample at MBGSF 2013. Poured a black color with a large frothy tan head that was mostly lasting and produced excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy roasted malt, bourbon, wood and vanilla aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy roasted malt, bourbon and wood sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to long duration. Solid drinkable brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
4377,"2013-05-31",3.9,"Had this on draft at the Perrin brewery. Crazy oak and sweet taste. Bourbon shines but isn't over the top. Well rounded and ABV is hidden nicely","Chicago, Illinois, USA","kaser"
