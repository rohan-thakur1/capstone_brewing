Taste brings in grapefruit rind bitterness but there is a definite malty/bread sweetness comprising the backbone. Hard candy comes to mind. Bitterness sticks around in the finish. Sticky and oily texture. Feels like it¬ís just shy of the well balanced effort I¬ím craving. I would call it overly bitter at the end.

2394,"2017-03-08",4.2,"FEB 2017. Hazy amber pour. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

Outstanding nose of citrus (orange, grapefruit), pine with a good dose of spruce, light pepper and spice over a solid caramel base of toasted biscuit.

Heavy medium body that almost achieves light full. This results in a smooth rich texture that is slick with distinct creamy aspects. World class carbonation / body balance that provides just the right amount of effervescence in both the middle and finish to allow flavor separation and support of the texture.

The flavor profile is outstanding. The balance is world class. Separation is an on going affair that occurs over a mild bitterness that is contrasted with a perfect amount of toasted / nutty sweetness. The citrus aspects of the nose aren¬ít prevalent, although orange rind is present. Orange becomes more pronounced as it warms, especially towards the finish as sweetness is ascending. Caramel is also less pronounced than expected with toasted biscuit being the base. Cold, spruce / pine hop flavors are most noted. As it warms, these become more competitive with orange rind. The finish is a slow fade of blended hops over a sweet base with a touch of lingering pepper.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

2394,"2017-02-20",3.2,"12 oz. bottle, consumed on 12-7-17. Pours a mostly clear but slightly hazy amber to copper with a very large amount of yellowish beige head. Uneven head. Substantial lacing. Would look good, but excessive head is an automatic minus one point for the appearance. Pleasant, biscuit and cracker aroma. Scents of grapefruit and apricot. The lack of sophistication in the aroma becomes more evident on multiple sniffs; it does smell good, but not as good as the first whiff suggested. Pencil shavings. Toast crust. Fruitiness upon multiple sips: Strawberries or raspberries and cream. Pretty darn dry. Flat liquid in the palate, likely due to the excessive head. Easy to drink. Essentially a red IPA, it seems. My kind of beer, but imperfectly executed. The hops are fruitier and juicier than I would prefer, a problem that afflicts all too many hoppy beers these days.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

2394,"2015-12-27",2.6,"Pours from can a beautiful reddish amber with soapy off-white head that looks frolicsome but doesn¬ít last long except for a wee bit of lacing.
The initial aroma is off-putting: pine, earth, soap, grass, salvaged by a hint of malt. As it warms, the nose opens up considerably to citrus and even peach.
Unfortunately, those more positive notes don¬ít turn up in the glass, where the flavor remains resinous pine oil, dank hops and the occasional brief burst of malt sweetness that does not mesh well into the prevailing bitterness. Thin bodied.
Searching the can for any suggestion of how this is global or warming. There¬ís nothing other than a suggestion not to use excessive energy through lengthy refrigeration.
Good advice, but just another pedestrian beer from the all you need is bitterness school. Still, kudos to the marketer.","","Pumpkin87"

Slightly spicy, earthy hop aroma with resinous oils and grassy pine needle character countered by a lightly roasted, sweet malt backbone. Floral with hints of cut grass, dank buds and subtle citrus sweetness followed by caramel malt, toast, and dark fruit notes. Nothing in the nose suggests winter but there¬ís a decent balance of fresh hops and sweet malt. The hop presence is slightly one dimensional and could use some citrus/tropical fruit character but the aroma is still somewhat inviting. 

On the fuller end of medium body with a blast of dank, sticky hop bitterness that dominates, lingering over the sweet malt notes into a bone dry finish. Earthy, resinous and slightly spicy with dry, grassy pine needle flavor and a touch of citrus sweetness, notably grapefruit and orange peel. Underneath, there¬ís a sweet caramel backbone balancing things out nicely with hints of toffee, hazelnut and vinous dark fruit.

2394,"2014-10-08",3.8,"Transfer from BA review on 1-7-14-

 Served on tap in a pint glass

 Appearance ¬ñ The beer is served with a medium amber color with a one finger of an off white colored head. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave a moderate level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell ¬ñ The aroma of the beer is strongest of a grapefruit and pine hop smell mixed with some other hop aromas of grass. Along with these smells are some sweeter aromas of a tropical fruit nature with tangerine and a bit of mango. A little bit of caramel and roasted malt smells are in there as well, rounding out the smell to produce a pretty smooth and nice IPA like aroma. 

 Taste ¬ñ The taste begins a lightly toasted malt taste with a relatively strong presence of grapefruit and pine hop right up front. Some sweetness of a caramel nature is upfront as well, giving the beer a moderate level of sweetness. As the taste advances the sweeter caramel is replaced by some sweeter tropical fruit flavors of tangerine, pineapple and mango. The grapefruit and pine hop flavors get more intense, bitter, and resinous in nature as the flavor advances to the end. With a little bit of grass joining the taste profile late in the taste, one is left with a rather strongly pine and grapefruity hopped and tropical fruity sweetened flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel ¬ñ The body of the beer is on the average side with a carbonation level that is average as well. The medium carbonation and body are nice for the blend of fruity and hoppy flavors and creates a rather nice easy drinking brew overall.

 Overall ¬ñ A rather tasty red IPA with a nice blend of grapefruit and pine hop mixed with a nice level of sweetness. A nice drinker overall.","","Darkmagus82"

2394,"2014-03-04",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Citrus fruit and floral hop aromatics are grounded in honeyed sugars before resinous bitterness settles this IPA-like brew.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam crowns the hazy amber.
-Malt character is lighter than expected.
-Drinkability is quite high.
-Mouthfeel is slender and carbonation is soft.
-This might not be the most memorable brew, but it is well made and enjoyable.

Pours hazy on the orange side of amber with a thick and foamy eggshell-colored head, lacing is a bit uneven - both large and small lace is present. The taste is medium caramel sweetness with a bit of hoppy bitterness at the swallow. There¬ís also a citrus presence throughout the drink, but I can¬ít quite place it - another review mentioned grapefruit, which seems fair. Relatively light body (considering the caramel / malty flavoring) which finishes creamy smooth with very little (if any) carbonation; however, some of the hoppiness sticks around at the finish; not overwhelming like some IPA¬ís, but the faint, thin grassy coating of the mouth is reminiscent; in fact, depending on food pairings, it may be beneficial. There¬ís an interesting umami-cheesy flavor (think aged parmesan) that pops up about mid drink as it begins to warms - I¬ím still relatively undecided on it, but it does give this beer a uniqueness to it. Overall, a drinkable session beer - careful though, that 7% has a way of sneaking up on ya. It¬ís relatively mild overall - some sweetness, but not overwhelming - so a good one to bring to a party, and surely a crowd pleaser.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

2394,"2013-12-11",3.9,"I poured a 12oz can into a goblet. It had a best before date of 3/27/14 and cost $3.30 ($0.28 per ounce).

Appearance: A hazy shade of dark amber, though carbonation can be seen at the middle of the glass. Pours to a small, off-white, frothy head which retains and laces well.

Smell: Fairly strong aroma of piney, resiny hops. Lightly sweet and floral.

Taste: With a name like ""Global Warmer"" and the fact it¬ís a winter seasonal, I was fully expecting Sixpoint¬ís latest canned offering to be a winter warmer. It¬ís actually a strong amber ale, which is a nice change of pace for the season and this brewery. Though Sixpoint is known for being hop-centric and this beer is no exception. Plenty of East Coast-style piney, resiny hop character to this one with some rustic malt backbone. Nothing especially ""wintry"" or ""Christmasy,"" but it¬ís certainly a big enough brew to complement colder weather.

Right away, the classic amber malt backbone emerges, though it¬ís not nearly as sweet as most of the style (though I actually prefer it this way). The palette changes nearly on a dime as it begins its decent. An intense, dank bitterness seems to manifest out of nowhere. A strong hop flavor of pine needles, pine sap and some rich earthy character as well. I tend to find this more often in black IPAs, so its presence here is unusual, but a nice change of pace. 

Drinkability: While Sixpoint Global Warmer is definitely the hop bomb at 70 IBUs, it¬ís not intimidating to drink. The mouthfeel is on the calmer, more tepid side and much thinner than it probably should be considering it¬ís a fairly big beer at 7% ABV. It¬ís smooth going down, though it does leave an astringent aftertaste. A good beer to stand up to a strong meal, but also tasty enough to appreciate on its own.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
