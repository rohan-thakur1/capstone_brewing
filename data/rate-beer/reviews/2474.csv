2474,"2017-04-05",4.9,"UPDATED: APR 10, 2017 This is lager?!?! Whoaaa....
This beer is out of this world. It competes easily with best IPAs, but it is Pils... This is purely genial invention. I simply love this beer.
Pours hazy, dark golden liquid, with medium white top.
Aroma - hops, grapefruit, spring flowers, blackcurrant and mango. 
Taste - bitter, but at the same time light and refreshing, altough hoppiness hits hard like a sledgehamer. But the bitterness is balanced by a slightly sour side taste and it gives a real grapefruit and tangerine mix with hints of spruce wax. And then tere is a subtle taste of malts somewhere... Really-really nice and warm feeling as it goes down. Again - ABV feels almost non-existent, making it a quite cunning drink :)
Aftertaste - hoppy, fruity and bittersweet. Aftertaste is strong and lasts for at least ten minutes, then it slowly fades away leaving a bit peppery memory.
Well, it is one of the best hoppy lagers out there IMHO. Juicy, refreshing and crazy.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","CaskSensei25"

2474,"2015-12-18",3.7,"Rated pe 18.12.2015.bottle. Amber, hazy unfiltered. Really intense hoppy aroma, filled pretty much the whole room with a citrussy grapefruity green berry, piney fragrance on opening. Med bodied, bitter, but still drinkable, balanced enough. Feels robust. Pale malts, but mostly hops. Resinous finish. Really nice, intense hoppy drink. Cant find much lager in it, but dont care either.-- bb","FINLAND","jookos"

2474,"2015-12-16",3.5,"Bottle. Hazy pale-ish amber beer, medium to small white head. Nose is a big hit of hops, resiny-fruity notes, pine, oranges and grapefruit, mango. Flavor is a heap of hops, more pine resin and oranges. Finishes with lots of grapefruit and yet more resin. This is the resiniest lager Ive ever had, its a bit silly, but it works. Naturally the pile of hops cover up the booze pretty nicely, although there is an inkling of the ABV in the finish and aftertaste.","ESTONIA","suurjuust"
2474,"2015-12-12",4.6,"Orange color with small white head. Wow, the aroma is over the top hoppy, fruity and piney. Taste is also overwhelmingly hoppy, fruity, flowery, grassy. Has to be the hoppiest beer on the market. Huge hit of bitterness yet still easy to drink. Truly magnificient beer","ESTONIA","Inci"

2474,"2015-12-07",4.8,"Hazy yellow pour with 1 finger of white foam. Massive aroma of citrus fruits, passion fruit, peach, orange and some dank fresh grass. Explosion of hoppy flavors in the mouth- mainly orange, citrus but also getting some sweet malts. Oily and sticky mouthfeel that coats the mouth with hoppy goodness. Low carbonation which helps hops and malts come through. Lager yeast makes this beer easily quaffable and lets the hops take the stage. Awesome!","","Eltz"
2474,"2015-12-06",3.3,"UPDATED: DEC 13, 2015 Tap (Koht, Tallinn) (5:3:5:3:10=2.6)
Big hoppy aroma, fruity and sweet, fleshy fruits. Quite musky, sweaty, even BO. Pretty potent and pungent in the mouth. Clear alcohol, and pungent stanky hops. Sweet, and a little sticky palate. A bit over the top and silly, but drinkable.
Rerate: 330ml bottle (Drink Baar, Tallinn) (6:4:6:4:13=3.3)
Much better. Bold bombastic hopping, fruity. Taste ditto. Has a balance to it, despite the over-the-toppiness. Cleaner hopping, less stank. I dont even like over-hopped beers, but I cant fault this at all - congratulations! Rerates are good!","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
2474,"2015-12-06",4.8,"Totally new style for me - India Pale Lager. And imperial. Hazy in appearance, but the aroma.. this is something special - fruity, floral and overhelming.. the taste is not that bitter at one would expect from aroma, but there is a strong bitterness which comes and comes in aftertaste","FINLAND","Mickey1965"
2474,"2015-12-06",4.5,"Pours a deep gold color, with nice carbonation that provides a white head. Aromas of citrus, grapefruit, fresh flowers and nice lager malt. Taste is glorious. Lovely harmony between the lagered yeast and the hops. Very bold flavor. A nice crisp, dry finish leaves me wanting more. Great beer!","Rae vald, ESTONIA","Armi"
2474,"2015-12-05",4.7,"Huge aroma of ripe pineapple and passionfruit. Light body with lots of hop oils. Bitterness is powerful and fruity, Citrus, and grassy. Tons glong on here. Unique and awesome beer.","ESTONIA","estoniancraft"
