4346,"2017-05-18",3.5,"A couple of bottles split with my father in law. This was an interesting experience -- I drank two bottles, and they were quite different. The first was sweet and a bit boozy, perhaps a bit more so than Id expect for a strong ale. The second was much more balanced with enough hop aroma to make it taste like an English IPA. It was so strange I had to do a double check of the bottles. Hard to rate because of the different experiences, but they both shared a classic English malt and yeast flavor profile.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

4346,"2017-04-15",3.5,"Botella en 99Cervezas.

De intensidad media en nariz, da inmediatamente notas de pan fresco, seguidas de un punto herbal, de manzana y suaves notas de lúpulo. Quizá también algo floral. Complejidad media.

Vierte en un precioso color dorado algo rojizo y totalmente transparente. Espuma media de un perfecto color blanco, con burbuja media-grande y persistencia moderada. Buena adherencia también. Una cerveza realmente agradable de ver.

De entre los sabores básicos, destaca en boca el salado, el amargo y el dulce a un tiempo. El salado desaparece rápidamente y el dulce va ganando importancia, aunque mantiene un buen equilibrio con un amargo muy suave y en absoluto agresivo o astringente. El pan vuelve a salir aquí. El conjunto es equilibrado y con un final dulce, pero no empalagoso.

En boca es de peso medio, algo sedosa y con una cierta sensación espumosa. De persistencia media, aunque el dulce parece acumularse con cada trago. Aun así resulta agradable. En todo caso, podría no ser la cerveza preferida de los que no les gustan con un final dulce.","Valencia, SPAIN","JuanCC"

This was poured into a mug.

4346,"2013-05-13",3.9,"500ml bottle bought at Olivers Delicatessen in Central.
Mostly clear amber honey colour, slightly cloudy hazy, with trace of dirt like yeast sediments; One finger head and crumpety off-white foam which last for 1 minute; Good sticky lacing and active carbonation; Very fragrant aroma of grapefruit, jackfruit, light pineapple, sweet tropical  fruits, malt, light caramel, sugar, fruit cake, and light grass. Trace of banana smell becomes evident as the beer warms; Pleasant, mid to light sweet taste of ale malt, with burnt caramel / toffee, light grapefruit, medium liquorices, dark fruits, strong lime, citrus and strong herbal grassy hops; Full body, slick and rich palate; Taste profile is medium sweet and very hoppy ale malt with good touch of burnt toffee, good blends of grapefruit and liquorices in between. Mouth feel is fulfilling and richer than most ales. Very nice! Hoppiness is another real deal here - complex and fragrant fruity aromas, strong, expressive, quite refreshing but not overbearing in bitterness, and surprisingly low in astringency for a short finish; Fairly dry after taste, very pleasant to mouth.

Comments: A very nice ale, with lots of emphasis being placed on sophisticated and fragrant aromas, rich and tasty ale body (thanks to re-pitching), and expressive yet low key bitterness. Taste-wise, its rather straight forward and lacks varieties, and its astringency should really be boosted up more to complement its already rich taste. Very enjoyable, but not quite mind-blowing.

Poured into a standard UK pint sleeve glass.

Slightly cloudy it was a tangerine orange/amber colour with a huge cauliflower head very like the ones seen at breweries on open fermenting tanks.

The yeast aroma from the head was very powerful and it overshaddowed the hops and malt smells trying to get out, very impressive.

A deep, traditional English Ale bitterness, grainy and a good balance of hops, malt and yeast.

Depth of flavours hide the alcohol very well and the whole beer seems to be a well balanced blend of good quality ingrediants.

A very good beer, now one of my favourites.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

A - Light orange amber color. Large, bubbly, foamy white head. Good retention with a decent amount of lacing left.

S - A bit of caramel malt as well as some fruit (apple, lemon, and orange). Slight hop smell.

T - A fair amount of caramel and toffee malt. Also a good amount of bready taste. Some fruit flavors, a lot of apple and a little berry. Also a good amount of lemon taste. Good amount of hops that are pretty prominent. Floral, herbal, and earthy taste. Good balance. Finishes with a little bit of a mineral and medicinal taste.

Rated:14.11.2007
Bottle 500ml, 16 P
Appearance: Pours deep lively, cloudy, unpasteurized, living and fermented body, with very lively carbonation reminding of a wheat, yeasty ale. What is really amazing and surprising is that despite the fact that the carbonation is really very lively, it is only natural with no artificial carbonation, very well fermented and naturally effervescent. Looks thick and full bodied, the head after you pour the beer is not big but firm, regularly structured and almoust completely lasting. Head is off white in colour with some shades of orange and light beige. Lacing is fair to medium.
Aroma: Very hoppy on the top, freshness of hops is kicking your nose, orange, citrusses, lime, cask wood, a hint of sauerkraut, carrot, fermented fruits, winy character, very mature and strong aroma of fermentation, juicy exotic fruits, mango, molasses, raisin, old  perfumes being out of date, resin, a hint of yeasts, generally accidic aroma, port wine, maple syrup, curdled milk, cucumber, very well blended aromas and perfectly balanced, complex and multidimentional.
Flavour: Accidic, sour, like sauercraut or cucumber fermented water, dry, no sugar note at all, hints of orange and banana from the lively fermentation of yeasts corelating with the lively and harsh carbonation tickling your tongue. You can really feel the beer in a way like you are touching something lively with your tongue. Than what comes is hoppy nose, alcohol is hidden somewhere between those planty unusual tastes, tangy, orange juice, fermented yeasts, cask wood wallnuts essence. Finish duration is average.
Palate: Body is medium, texture is tangy, accidic and dry, carbonation is lively on palate, finish feel is accidic and astringent.","Zawiercie/Sosnowiec, POLAND","sirPino"

This brew wound up being the overall winner, trumping other entries by a wide point spread. Pours a deep lightly cloudy amber with a thick resilient off-white head. Aroma is malt forward with toffee, bread and light floral notes. Nice thick mouthfeel and hides it ample alcohol content well. Finishes balanced, wavering back and forth between malt and hops.","Thomasville, North Carolina, USA","freekyp"

Best Before 8/06

I didnt think to check the bottle at the store so this ones a few months past its best by date. Youngs Special London Ale poured a crystal clear light caramel colored concoction. A 2+ finger frothy slightly off white head formed on the pour with a minimal amount of carbonation bubbles rising to the head. The head fell to a small island in the middle of my glass after a half-pint.

Mildly toasted grains come through in the smell first along with a slight vegetal aroma that actually compliments things. A deeper whiff pulls out hints of grapefruit rind and a caramel maltiness. Smells appetizing.

Flavor starts out with a nice dose of caramel that stays in the background. This first touch of caramel leads seamlessly into a toasted grains and grapefruit rind. Fineshes with the grapefruit growing somewhat stronger with a mild floral presence from the hops. A few wafts of alcohol are present on the swallow. Good stuff.

Medium bodied with some alcohol fumes on the finish. Smooth body that slides through effortlessly. I could sip the night away with this.

Overall this is an enjoyable ESB. Id like to try a fresher example and will update when I do. Even in its older form this is an easy drinking tasty ale.

Overall, kind of like a cream ale attack with a strong citrusy hops bitter finish.  Creamy texture, tickling carbonation, bitterness is medium-high, long finish.  Tasty beer, unlike most English beers this is not the kind of beer you want drink quickly with big sips.  This was Londons last brewery and it is now out of business.  So unfair, its the restaurants they need to close in London.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Lighter in colour than one would expect: chiefly an ambery copper.  6.4% in strength and tastes every percentile of that percentage.  Fairly enjoyable if quaffed slowly on a winter day, but not what I would call a session beer; if you tried to neck more than two of these mothers, youd be in big trouble!  Also, beware - this is a living ""real ale"", classified thus by CAMRA as it matures in the bottle.

Peaches, caramel and grapefruit in the taste. Some wild strawberries show up both in the nose and flavor. A strong hop presence with an extraordinary enjoyable strong bitter finish. Best served not to cool, almost at room temperature. Highly recommended! I love the form of the bottle and the design of the label too. It s a real pitty this ale has been retired.

Extremely pleasant. Rerate 4: (after dozens of samplings) Definetely one of the best beers I have had so far. A lot of vanilla notes. Sublime.

4346,"2006-10-08",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 20, 2010 {thoughts} Strongly biscuit-malty with bright fruity esters and a firm hop character --balanced and bold.

{elements} Deep brassy hue; short, white froth. Bold, biscuit malt nose, light toffee with substantial fruity esters of pears and grapes followed by honey. Off-dry, moderately acidic (carbonic), moderately bitter; fruity and toasty aftertaste. Creamy texture, full carbonation, medium body.  50 cl bottle, best before 16.07.11. Previous score was a 3. 

Tall, creamy and off white the head rests above a clear, medium amber-orange hued beer.  Big aromas of bread and cookie combine with a slightly milder toffee element.  A strong orange marmalade hop aroma rides above softer woodsy elements.  Slightly sour-citric and doughy yeast undertones round out the experience along with flinty edges.  Soft pale malts begin the flavor alongside a distinct pear like acidity and a light, leafy bitterness.  Rather doughy through the middle with a sharply acidic and firmly bitter finish.  Lingering orange rind flavor.  Medium weight with a slick texture and prickling carbonation.  Like a few other bottle-conditioned English Strong Ales Ive had, there is a pervasive sour element to this beer that Im not terrible fond of.
Original rating (6/3/7/4/13=3.3):  Pint bottle, snifter.  Average, creamy, frothy, white head is quickly diminishing.  Toasted grain, cookie, toffee malt (H); flower, perfume and orange hops (M); hint of ginger in the aroma.  Moderately sweet, lightly acidic flavor becomes a moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter finish.  Medium-full body, creamy texture, lively carbonation.  The bottom line is: aroma is really underpowered but the flavor is nice...still not enough oomph or subtlety.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

Light, somewhat single-dimensional carmel flavor that fades abruptly, leaving just a bit of lingering fruitiness. Soft, mouthfilling carbonation. A fine ale, with lots of the qualities that are endearing about British beer. Though disappointingly short in the finish, and a bit unimaginative in its malt profile, it has a certain charm.

4346,"2006-06-03",3.4,"Just better than average across the board. Poured an amber to light brown color with a nice head. The best part of the appearance was the long lasting trail of lace on the glass. The aroma was malty and somewhat buttery. The flavor was balanced between malts and hops, but I couldnt get past the butter that was just underneath the toffee, caramel malt base. Very light touch of fruits was noticeable, perhaps from the hops.","","User37895"
4346,"2006-06-01",3.5,"01-Jun-06 (500 ml bottle: $2.49 at BevMo in San Diego/Carmel Mountain, CA) Flavorful and well-balanced, this bottle-conditioned British ale is malty, sweet and fruity, but also moderately bitter with a touch alcoholic.  The sweet, malty nose suggests toasty grain, light caramel and some tea.  The medium-full body fills every crevice of the mouth and doesnt thin on the palate as the beer finishes.  Carbonation is moderate.  Slightly hazy, amber-colored body is capped by at least an inch of off-white head on the pour, but that gradually settles to a wide ring while leaving spotty lacing on the glass.   A good beer overall, quite enjoyable, but it still doesnt truly impress me.      06-Apr-05 (500 ml bottle) This Millennium Edition bottle has been sitting my fridge for, well, a long time.  Probably too long.  Mildly malty and fruity nose is pleasant, but too mild light overall to excite the senses.  The flavor is malty, fruity, a bit nutty and slightly bitter in the finsh, but this just isnt grabbing me.  Golden amber color, with a slight bit of haziness.  Small off-white head quickly fades to a rim and then to nothing.  Ill rerate this beer with a fresh bottle. (7, 3, 7, 3, 14 = 3.4)","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

4346,"2006-05-21",4.7,"This beer in my opinion is a classic English pale ale/IPA. This beer strikes an incredible balance of malt, hops, and esters, and makes for one fantatic drinking beer. Youngs Special London Ale pours to a beautiful, bright, amber color, with a creamy white head, and a moderate carbonation. The nose on this beer is excellent with lots of good flowery hop aromas, paired with some good pale malt aromas, and light esters of fruit. The palate is firm, with very good pale malt flavor, paired with some ""flinty"" flavor, and light, estery fruit flavor. SLA finishes with more good pale malt and esters up front, then ends with a very pleasing, flowery bittereness that balances this one out to perfection. Outstanding beer which would work well with classic pub grub, and hearty dishes. A classic.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

really refreshing for a beer of 6.4%vol.
first,i drank some of the content of the bottle in the way the brewery describes it,without pouring much sediment in the glass.then i tasted the rest of it with the sediment,then the colour is a little moretroubled,less bright,but nice too
the taste is abit yeastier then,but altough hoppy,spicy and orange-like.so,i dont understand,why the brewery suggests to let the sediment in the bottle.(i like unfiltered beers,but i know,some people dont do!but here it would be a pity to drink it without the sediment!)

Sticks around a while - nice, thick layer of foam that stays until the end.  Big lacing.  Aroma is malty, tiny bit spicy, getting a little of the mossy type aromas of the english (fuggles and EKG) type hops. I swear I wrote that before I read the commercial description here - Im getting good. ;)   Smell reminds me of a Fullers or Bodingtons.  Flavor is well balanced, bitter up front and in the finish, sweet and malty in the middle.  Although Im not picking up anything more specific than that, no distinct flavors.  Palate is very drinkable.  Light, high level of carbonation, and a little dry in the finish.  Overall a very good beer.  I thought it was an ESB until I logged on here - I guess the 6.4% puts it out of ESB range.  This is much better than any nitro english ale Ive ever had.  It grew on me as well.

4346,"2005-11-10",3.5,"The first of the Youngs bottled ales, that I have tasted, to atleast excite my taste buds. Held captive for half a year I feared it dead, but it lived up to label description and seemed fresh as ever. Poured into an English pint glass, quite cool. Clear, brilliant in fact, orangey copper body with very small spurts of fine carbonation raising up a thin, dense and creamy layer that lasted and left a little lace. It simply looked good and profoundly British in the pint. Clean, piney and grassy, orange and tangerine nose; fresh but simple. Quite citric and spicy in the mouth, fresh and quenching. Medium bodied and soft in carbonation. Flavours of tangy oranges and tangerines, grapefruit and pine nuts (it simply reminded me of a pine forest!), toffee upfront and perfumy, floral hops in the back that balanced it out with success. Finish is crisp, clean and lightly bitter with a lingering flavour similar to its simplistic palate. I didnt see the need for this to be so high in alcohol as it was a fairly simple ESB style beer, thirst quenching and easy drinking. Quite nice!! (50cL, 26/03/06, Intl Beer Shop, W.

Pours a slightly hazy orange-gold.  Head disappears so fast I can only just make out it was a yellowish off-white.  Oily rather than lacey.  Nose is hops and esters - I definitely get the maris otter malt but its mostly oranges, lemonade, spices, musty and the alcohol is quite pungent.  A hint vegetal in the background suggests this ones not 100%.  A dry, spicey, flavour is dominated by orange citrus and spice, after a candy-like opening.  As it warms a strong, toffee, toastiness comes through.  Alcohol is warm-to-hot in the mouth.  Medium mouthweight become quite creamy as it warms.  This is good but its lacking the smoothness of a very great belgian strong ale.  Its also not totally well-kept, I reckon.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","yalnikim"

Malt is up front with orange/citrus flavours, slight alcohol and a pleasant hoppy finish. RERATE: From 500ml brown bottle. Pours orange with a small tight persistent white cap. Aroma is toffee malt with a light note of alcohol, faint floral hops. Flavour first presents toffee malts, then hits a light yeasty note, some alcohol and fruitiness. Medium body with low, gentle level of carbonation. Not sure if the beer has changed, or my palate has, or both, but Im not detecting a whole lot of citrus this time around.

Fruity notes of plum and apples come through pleasantly.  Carbonation is also quite light.  The body is quite good, moderately full, and the finish moderately dry.

4346,"2005-02-07",3.6,"Over the past number of years, Ive bought at least 3 bottles of this (the larger size -16.9oz?) - Every single one of them was a gushing monster that left less than 1/2 the bottle to drink.  So, I never bothered rating it - it tasted ""off"".  Recently, I found 4 packs of this and other Youngs brews, so I thought Id give it another try.  Copper penny with a thin white head that settles down to a thin ring around the edges.  Malty, fruity, lightly herbal hoppy aroma.  Taste is pleasantly mellow, caramel, fruit sweetness, bready,  nutty implications of a brown ale.  Finishes with a mellow, nicely rounded hop bitterness and then a slight chalk texture.  The warmer the better on this one.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"

There is a pleasant sweet malt aroma met with hints of fruit (bananna?), nuts and toffee. Bursting with flavor. Initially bitter-sweet toffee and nuts. The malt sweetness balances nicely by the hop bitterness.

4346,"2004-07-03",3.4,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2016 
 July 2002. Bottle. Excellent beer. Plenty of body and a good mouthfeel to ground the wonderful zingy and very fruitful hop buzz. Drunk quite young so its slightly fizzy, and the malt base and the hop zip are a little too far apart. [3.3]
 July 2004.  Bottle conditioned. BBE Dec 04. Compared with  Orval and Freeminers Waterloo. Opens with a hiss and a little whiff of vapour. Aroma is fruit, some wet cardboard, vintage ale notes and some bitterness. Less attractive than the Orval but at this stage more range and variety. After pouring the aroma contains bananas and volatiles, then just prickly metallic volatiles. The appearance is the richest and most attractive of the three beers - a glowing copper amber, slightly dark, with a loose bubble head evenly covering the beer. Raw meat, metal and damp cardboard are now the noticeable aromas, to be followed by banana, and at this stage the Youngs is the most interesting. Mouthfeel is fatter and oiler than the Orval and is sustained through to the finish. A very fulsome and pleasurable feel - alcohol is hardly evident,  just malty flavours. Good mouthfeel, but the Freeminers mouthfeel is much better. Flavours are smooth and fruity with a dark woody bitterness coming along in the middle, finishing with wet cardboard. A strange mix of banana, malt bread, metal and damp cardboard. The initial brown sugar sweetness is very pleasant, and the bitterness is serious and old school, but the cardboard is simply unpleasant, though it eventually fades until the flavour becomes consistantly pleasant, developing more and more as the beer progresses. Even though the Orval and the Youngs share brewing methods (same triple fermentation - one week open, followed by three weeks over a bed of Goldings, and then reprimed in the bottle), its the special Brettanomyces yeast developed by the Orval Abbey that really makes the difference between the beers. The Orval being quite dry, while the Youngs is sweeter with caramel notes. I prefer my beers to have a touch of sweetness balanced by bitterness, so this comes in just ahead of the Orval, though not by much. [3.6] 
July 2004 A second taste comparison - this time with Fullers 1845 and  Greene Kings Hens Tooth. The fruity lightness compared poorly to the other two, and this was placed last. [3.3]
Dec 2011 Compared again with Fullers 1845, and again came off worse. Theres nothing really distinctive about this beer, and it comes over as a bit wishy washy and even a bit muddled. Drinkable for sure, and pleasant enough, but if youre getting a bottle conditioned strong ale from one of the big British brewers, then the Fullers one is more impressive. [3.2]
Oct, 2016 I have a fair degree of respect for Youngs SPecial London, and is been a while since I had it, so to see it on offer at Asda for the same price as some 4% beers, then I had to grab a few. And it was worth it. This is the first 100% Charles Wells version Ive had, and its fine. Im not sure how close they follow the original recipe, including the open fermentation, and there is perhaps a lack of depth and character about this to suggest they cut corners, but its still a decent brew. Nice sweet malt with good body, and well integrated with English hops. Old fashioned and very satisfying. Nice. [3.5]","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

4346,"2004-02-05",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 31, 2006 Best by November 2006
Pours with a lightly hazy, reddish amber color and is topped by a frothy, pale tan, creamy colored head.  The beer is a bit overcarbonated and even foams up after I popped the cap, this seems to be a problem with many of these, but often they are not overcarbonated.  The aroma is a mix of earthy spice, a touch of citrus and some herbal notes, malty notes of caramel and toasted grain.

The taste is sweet and malty; notes of caramel and toasted grain provide a solid backdrop to the dominant hop character.  Fruit notes area mix of a touch of bergamot, which adds a citrusy component to the flavors, and a nice berry note that seems to be from the combination of the hops and malt..  Notes of lemon verbena, perhaps a touch of basil like sharpness, a touch of black pepper and just a touch of menthol. The note of bergamot is magnified as the beer warms up.

This beer is rich and satisfying, yet still nice and quaffable; the hops and malt weave quite a balance together.  The maltiness really adds a richness to this brew, almost a touch of a meaty quality here.  But really this meaty quality seems to be a combination of the caramelized malt, ample melanoids and a toasted, bready grain character.  If you can find a fresh bottle of this brew here in the states, this is well worth it.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

I think this beer has enough flavour to make a good session beer but this is a strong ale. Orangey, caramel aroma - no real perceptible hop (but it had travelled half-way around the world). Nice hop flavour and excellent bitterness (though I wouldnt call it exceptionally bitter) but the malt was a bit flabby - too much crystal and not enough base malt maybe? Another nice, but unexceptional Youngs beer. RR: I still dont really like this stuff. Tastes pretty much like a bitter, only its 6.4%. Some plum pudding in there.

4346,"2003-10-03",3.5,"I have a special fondness for Youngs.  This has irrational dimensions and this beer was able to slice through that fog of reason, if only shining a light on the quality of British breweries to brew over a dozen beers which essentially condense into two or three recipes with only slight variations.  Here we have a ye old English strong ale, pushed nicely to 6.4%, but appearing throughly average: a big, irregular, beige head settling into a slightly syrupy-appearing, copper-orange body.  The aroma is fruity, slightly wooden and caramelly, but notably driven by effervescent alcohol.  The tasting pleases the palate, for although early on the large-form carbonation seems to get in the way, with time it settles down nicely, and even after a long time sitting and warming the palate remains good, in part due to the alcohol, which produces a sharpish tingle but also due to the malt base that provides a sweet silkiness.  The flavor has metallic edges to the caramel and yeasty/bready notes.  The finish is moderately bitter, but only at the back of my tongue and only toward the end; otherwise the alcoholic notes are more pronounced.  Overall, slightly above average in the style and enjoyable in its own ways, with credit for being a ""soul beer""  because it is from Youngs, but this doesn't deserve huge accolades.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

4346,"2002-04-15",4.2,"Had a bottle of this when I was grilling out today...Spring Is Here!!  This brew pours a
hazy/murky bottle conditioned orange amber.  The rocky/frothy off-white head is huge
and mostly lasting with fair lacing.  The nose is subtle and complex; mostly sweet and
spicy with hints of flowers, herbs, resin, cask wood, honey, ginger, clove, licorice, cola,
and alcohol.  The complex flowery, rich, warm,  flavor is somewhere between a
doppelbock and a Belgian strong ale.  The average to long finish is alcoholic with notes of
cask wood.  The light to medium dry/creamy body has lively carbonation.  Very nice.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"
4346,"2002-04-12",3.2,"Not bad but a 
disappointing beer.  Nice bitter start but left a vinegary taste in my mouth.  I will definitely try it again.","Memphis, Tennessee, USA","SmellGood"
4346,"2002-03-25",4.1,"Wow.  A truely pleasant combination of IPA with mild.  A nice amber almost orange color, mild carbonation, stong bitterness, a little bit of toffee, it keeps you coming back for more.","Nottingham, New Hampshire, USA","turtlehead"
4346,"2002-03-23",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 9, 2004 USA keg: Clear brownish amber appearance, decent head formation. Rich malty, fruity aroma. Sweet toffee/caramel malts, pretty hearty and robust, alcoholevident with a bitter citric bite that runs throughout. Somewhat of a cross between an ESB and an IPA. Top notch brew and a current personal favorite.","California, USA","BeerLimey"
4346,"2002-03-22",4.2,"Nice bitter  carmel malt taste. Some tea flavors also. It gets much smoother as it warms.","FLINT, Michigan, USA","pauliefrog99"
4346,"2002-03-07",4.0,"Nice golden color and clean, hoppy aroma.  The taste is bitter as expected but not too much so by any means, and malty caramel notes make for a nice finish.  This gets even smoother when it warms a bit, with some sweetness and maybe even a little really hoppy citrus.  I would have thought the ABV to be higher than it is, mainly because of the warming effect. Overall, my favorite of this style and one I try to have whenever possible!","Sherman, Texas, USA","unixweb"

4346,"2002-01-19",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2007 500ml bottle.  Fruity, lightly hoppy aroma, with notes of orange citrus,  cedar, grainy, gently sweet and toasty pale malts along with a blend of faint herbal spiciness and doughy yeast in the background.  Hazy medium-dark amber color with a lasting, creamy, off-white head that generated some impressive lacing.  Flavor profile is well balanced throughout, with a blend of sweet, lightly honeyish, toasty and nutty malts combined with a moderate amount of fruity hop flavor that also contributes a spicy, herbal, almost tea-like quality and medium amount of bitterness.  Finish is surprisingly long and juicy with plenty of hop tones.  Creamy and smoothly effervescent on the palate with a medium body.  Quite flavorful and drinkable.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

4346,"2002-01-02",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2004 Bottle conditioned, BBE March 2004. Amber, Initial flurry of white head soon disappears, quite low condition. Good fruit and caramel nose with hints of malt and good level of hop aromas, adding the yeast sediment improves the appeal. Full but soft in the mouth with delicate peppery hops and fruity malt, some traces of cardboard around the edges. Lots of toffee and hop bitterness in the finish with traces of yeast lingering.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"

4346,"2001-12-18",4.3,"Orange-red color, topped by a simply stunning thick-meringue head; nose full and flowery; flavor absolutely outstanding -- as many have commented, more hops than usual for an English ale, though still not a lot by USA standards-- but this is fine by me.  Caramel, orange flavors seem to dominate, but theres a lot going on.  Another winner from Youngs.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

4346,"2001-08-15",3.3,"Slight malt aroma.  Dark amber color.  Malt is subdued, not aggressive enough, which is okay for me.  But I export more with this type of British bitter/pale ale. Alcohol makes itself known after a few sips, along with bitterness. However, hop flavors are sadly missing. Certainly not an offensive brew, but I wouldnt go out of my way to try it again.","Rutland, Vermont, USA","canary dog"
4346,"2001-06-21",3.1,"Its good, but I dont see the greatness.  The chewy malt and earthy hops just dont quite come together for me.  A lot of good flavours, but they seem to fight each other.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
