2261,"2016-02-14",4.5,"Fles gekocht bij abdij De Koningshoeven, uitgeschonken in La Trappe Bokaal. Fraaie warme roodbruine kleur, met een lichte troebelheid, en een medium hoge crèmekleurige schuimkraag. Verfijnde aroma's van: karamel, rijpe banaan, amandelen, hazelnoten, licht rokerige eikenhout accenten en specerijen als vanille, gember en kaneel. Ook het smaakpallet is weer complex, en in deze batch #22 zacht en perfect gebalanceerd. Het zoete van de normale quadrupel wordt verzacht door de lagering op de verschillende eikenvaten. Met subtiele tonen van de Duitse whisky. Zachte en zoete karamel en honing notities, aangevuld met fruitige tonen van rijpe banaan, gedroogde appels en vijgen. Daarna komen de wat drogere tonen aan bod: amandelen, walnoten, houttannines en zachte subtiele whisky. De carbonatie is zacht prikkelend en de afdronk is moutig zoet, met verwarmende whisky elementen. Hoewel deze batch iets dichter bij het originele bier staat, verast in deze batch vooral de zachtheid en opbouwende complexiteit, met de Duitse whiskey duidelijk waarneembaar, in zowel aroma als smaakpallet. Mijn favoriete Oak Aged blijft tot nu toe batch #20, maar ook deze is weer van een uitmuntende kwaliteit.

2261,"2016-01-24",4.2,"Another new batch in this series, aged on German whisky barrels, with, as usual, a detailed explanation of the types of wood used, to be found on the website. Medium thick and stable, pale greyish beige, moussy, lacing head on top of a lightly hazy deep reddish bronze coloured beer with tiny bits of dead yeast already floating around everywhere. Rich bouquet of candied cherry, marmelade, caramel, dried banana, fig, faint coffee liqueur, clear but gentle whisky accent, vanilla-like tannins and wood, toasted bread, dates, brown sugar, port wine, ginger powder, violets, toffee, calvados, faint chicken broth, pear, cinnamon. Sweet, fruity onset of figs, dates and banana with a basic red berry sourishness; candi sugar presence elevates the sweetness but does not become cloying. Carbonation is medium and in fact a bit on the sharp side for this style, adding a slight numbing effect on the tongue. Rich, fluffy, rounded malt sweetness ensues, caramelly, honeyish and a tad nutty while the brown sugar and banana sweetness continues. Finishes malt sweet and full, yet dried by woody tannins, a notable whisky flavour (unsurprisingly) and a long afterglow of warming alcohol managing not to become too astringent, although it does burn a bit on the tongues surface. Hops, as in the basic beer, are not much more than a soft herbal bitterishness in the end providing balance and structure. Nice to see how the over-the-top caramel sweetness of the basic La Trappe Quadrupel is dried by the wood - and that is exactly what it needs, meaning these Oak Aged variants are far better than the regular. Yet in this one, the drying wood effect seems a bit more limited than in the preceding ones, so youll have to prefer your quads sweet in order to appreciate this. Id love to taste some of the previous issues against this one. The term quadrupel was launched by this brewery and this one sure is a great example of the style.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Nose is big on red fruits jam with bubblegum & sweet candy-like whiskey. Taste is explosive on bubblegum, vanilla, Jelly Belly candy, barrel is huge here, sweet dates, marzipan, syrup, sugar, red fruits jam, light overripe quality in the back, warming, Taste seems to lean closer to an Old Ale rather than a Quad. Lightly sparkling. This beer could be even thicker, it feels like with more malt this could have been a beautiful barley wine. Great stuff if you love beers with big sweet candy qualities. Nice desert beer. Not perfect que more thickness but a very lovely treat all the same, interesting, and another good one. Lightly warming in the back, curious about the whiskey used, must be a sweet & interesting treat. You need to love sweet malty beers in order to appreciate this one but despite the sweetness it isnt cloying nor does it feel overly heavy.

Ez az elegancia az ízében is maradéktalanul teljesülni látszik, tartalmas, de mégsem nehézkes, lágy és bársonyos kortyokba ágyazva bújnak meg a megszokott aszalványos-kompótos, cifra élesztős jegyek közé szőtt likőrös íznyalábok, mindez a megszokott vattacukros, rágógumis lepel alatt.
