4053,"2014-08-26",4.4,"Poured from a growler Into a Tree House Brewing stemmed glass.

The color is orange with yellow highlights with a finger of white head that leaves just a slight touch of lacing on the glass.

The smell has green grass aroma that gives some hints of earthy hops. There is a definite pine aroma in the nose that has some slight sweet candy aroma tied to it.

The taste is piney and resiny and really has a hop bite. There are touches of grapefruit and some citrus notes. The earthy spruce-tree flavor comes back toward the end and nips at the sides of your cheeks with bitterness.

The feel of this beer is medium bodied but does leave at times needing to really concentrate to wrap your head around this beer. There is a smooth drinkable feel that does offset an aftertaste that gives even more bitterness but does not wreck your palate.","Cumberland, Rhode Island, USA","Duhast500"

>> High Hill Farmstead like fill on the growler, no pop, consumed hours after filling from the brewery tap room, which could be renamed to ""growler filling station"" as that is all that Tree House is- same with Hill Farmstead. Pours a beautiful, full haze, deeper orange with thicker, rocky yellow foam. Nose is lightly sticky, butterscotch, vanilla, fruity papaya, funky and overripe melon, strawberry. Taste is mildly acidic, mildly sweet papaya smoothie, silky mouthfeel with an oats or rye chewiness/density. Silky and soft body. Extremely juicy and lightly bitter like grapefruit and papaya blended. Dry, but not chalky or papery. Hop forward but not bitter. Mild sugar remains to give it body and balance.

4053,"2014-03-04",4.5,"My Bottom Line:
Grapefruit juice, flower petals, orange zest and pine needles whirl about this Pale Ales dry and quenching mouthfeel, building up to a tantalizing tasting youd which would never stop.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam settles atop the misty golden.
-The resinous hop bitterness is swift, not too sticky. This, and the lean nature of the body, increases drinkability greatly.
-The hop character is so bright and juicy it is hard to get tired of it.
-This already tastes like a Pale Ale which is as accomplished as Hill Farmsteads Edward.

4053,"2014-01-26",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2016 750mL swingtop, bottled on 1/11/14, drunk 1/18/14Extremely tight carbonation produces a compact, creamy white head, atop a pale golden body, with a slight chill-haze to it. Head is well-retained. Pretty impressive appearance given the keg to swingtop production. Would certainly expect this from a bottle-conditioned beer. Appreciate the light haziness as well; its not filtered but has been given enough time to clear completely.Very strong aroma is all hoppiness...Mostly a citric IPA with navel oranges, white grapefruit and touches of lime. Perfectly attenuated malts give just a touch of honey on the end and balance the hop acids somewhat. With warming, I find tropical fruit notes; mango, pineapple and sweet lychee that add more depth to the hoppy presentation. No alcohol and most importantly no yeast stink, dirtiness or doughiness. AND no hop resin burn?? Literally not a touch of it. VERY impressive.Flavor follows from the nose. Tons of hoppiness, flavorful and moderately bitter, but the bitterness is spicy and citric, not resinous or alcoholic. Pale malts are soft and fully attenuated, giving the hops something to sink in to. Perfect balance and the mouthfeel, thanks to the tight carbonation, is creamy and supple.Really blown away by this stuff. Nothing flashy at all, just a wonderfully done pale ale. These guys have certainly made me a believer. The long wait-times to get their beer seem a little bit more understandable, having had this (and Julius, which is also stellar). Most impressed with the complete lack of resin burn (hop acid fatigue), yet without any sweet or thick maltiness. A study in balance.Rerate, canned 3/10/16, drunk 3/18/16.While this batch didnt live up to my memory of the previous batch I had, it was mostly that the carbonation was off, not so much any aspect of the aroma or flavor.  Just seemed a little loose and watery.  Granted this is not a big beer, but their growlers seem to have better carbonation than their cans, more often.  Really, really well-balanced beer and not flashy at all, as I remembered, with easygoing hoppiness and plenty of juiciness.  While this can certainly wasnt a 4.6, Im going to leave the score unchanged and chalk it up to the carbonation.  Will try again next back and see if this was just an anomaly.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
