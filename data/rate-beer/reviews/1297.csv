1297,"2016-06-08",3.3,"Tap at Bar Volo. Dark, reddish brown with thick, persistent light beige head. Dried and smoked dark fruits on the nose, some roastiness with an interestingly fun tropical candy element. Must be the Brett mixing in with all the rest. Tastes dry roasty sweet with a bitter fruity character. Very light on the palate, watery on the tongue and roasty dryish in the finish. A pretty interesting hybrid although Id honestly prefer a Orval or a good ESB instead. Was fun nevertheless.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Kauge"

1297,"2015-10-02",3.6,"Cask at Bar Volo. Somewhere between ruby and chestnut brown. Small white head. Definitely ESB in the nose, with maybe a little more brown sugar than usual. Flavour is Brithops, lightly toasted malts, fruity yeast, and there is an interesting bitterness in the finish. An ideal beer for the cask.","Cavan Monaghan, Ontario, CANADA","TheJester"
1297,"2014-07-16",3.2,"Smells good, chocolate and stouty. On cask at barvolo.
But very light. Passable beer. Better carbonated.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
1297,"2014-03-17",3.9,"On tap at Bar Volo, pours a super dark mahogany / dark brown / black with a small tan head. Aroma is like that the Fermium black IPA, with loads of roasted malt and resinous hops. Flavour is nothing like a traditional ESB and more like a black IPA with an English malt bill, with notes of English roasted malt, bready rye notes, and substantial piney hops. Full-flavoured and creamy on the mouthfeel. Excellent stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1297,"2013-04-06",3.5,"A dark reddish brown ale with a thin brown head. In aroma, a rather vinous malt with fruity esters, quasi Belgian qualities, burned caramel, very nice. In mouth, a smooth lightly peated malt, licorice and sweet fruity esters.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
1297,"2013-03-15",3.5,"On cask @ Bar Volo TO. Pours a near opaque brown with a patchy off-white head. Aroma is like banana bread (wow)!! Smells like...awesomeness. Taste is subtly sweet, some bread/yeast, mild bitterness, and some alcohol. Mouthfeel is creamy and extremely smooth with a very short and gentle bitter finish. Very unique brew with an amazing aroma but the taste doesn't live up to the aroma.

1297,"2012-11-23",3.8,"From notes, at Bar Volo. Pours a dark brown colours with a nice tan head. Aroma is biscuit malts. Flavour of herbal hop bitter and noticeable sweet malts. Chocolate notes as well and a nice lingering aftertaste.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","AGAquino"
1297,"2012-09-10",3.0,"Smells slighlty malty. Taste has some coffee bitter, a little nuttiness. Pour brownish red. Hand pulled so carbonation is low. Not much head or lacing. Very mild beer.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"
1297,"2012-01-05",3.6,"On cask at Volo.  Pours a dark brown with decent-sized off-white head.  Aroma is lightly roasty, mild caramel malt and modest citric hops.  Flavour roasty and hoppy with decent toffee maltiness.  Mellow carbonation.  Unique and interesting - almost like a restrained, sessionable black IPA.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Spab"
1297,"2011-11-15",3.9,"At volo, very nice beer, it has a nice black colour, with a really nice mix of bitter qualities with black beer qualities. nice offering would have this one again","Ontario, CANADA","Ontbeertaster"
1297,"2011-11-11",3.8,"ive never heard of a black ESB before, but this seems like it fit the bill perfectly. chocolate and roast character with a nice amount of hoppy bitterness and a lightish mouthfeel. very good","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","RayOhm"
1297,"2011-11-01",3.4,"Cask Days 2011, I think i now get this concept. In my notes i didnt feel there were too many ESB charcteristics here, A black ESB mixed with Run DMC. Seems more roasty porterish, Nice roast, mild bitterness. Interesting beer","Buffalo, New York, USA","swoopjones"

1297,"2011-04-02",3.7,"Deep brown pour with a light tan head. The aroma is slightly oxidized with a bit of nice Maris Otter crackery base. A bit earthy with some mushroomy savoury flavour as well. There is a fairly pronounced herbal hop character and the dark malts arent really toasty at all, but they add a bit of that clean carafa dark malt. As it warms up, there is a nice soft cocoa character that comes up. A bit of herbal flavour on the back as well. Its quite unique and pretty tasty.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1297,"2011-02-18",3.6,"Cask at Volo, New Years Eve 2010.  Thick-looking brown-black (like a porter) pour with a fairly large foamy mottled tan head.  Aroma is C-hop and cedar with mocha-toffee rich sweetness.  Taste follows - nougat and evergreen hops - not all that well meshed, but bitterness and sweetness do match and cancel each other fairly  well (not much alcohol intruding either).  Pretty thick, solid carbonation for a cask offering, quite malty to start, finishes with green bitterness and leaves a dry cocoa lingering coating on the tongue.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

1297,"2011-01-17",3.7,"Cask at Volo. Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a large frothy tan head and tons of chunks and floaties -- looks great! Great lacing. Mild aroma is lightly roasty along with leafy hops and hints of coffee and chocolate. Flavour of lightly roasted caramel malt, a decent amount of leafy hops, subtle touches of coffee and chocolate and a short bitter finish. Creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied. Very good stuff.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","blankboy"

1297,"2011-01-02",3.9,"2010-12-31. Black body with a small tan head and lace. 3+ Silky average plus bodied palate. 3+ Flavour is interesting, modest bitterness throughtout, sweet malt middle has an English character about it. whispers of caramel malt. Barest kiss of roast and subtle chocolate notes that could easily become caramel sweetness if not watched. Light bitterness and hops linger quietly in the finish and slowly grow stronger as the glass goes on. 7+ Modest aroma, light dusty sweet malt has a lingering caramel sweetness with modest green leafy hops trying to nudge it out of the way. 7+ Not sure I would reach for this often, but it just comes together really nicely, and would make for an exceptionally drinkable session beer.

1297,"2011-01-01",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2011 [3528-20101231] Cask. Grainy sand aroma has a sweet maple wood note that comes out as it warms. Hazy, dark black brown body with a long-lasting creamy tan head. More roast grain malt in the flavour with a hint of earthy poop. Interesting to sample, odd at first but good. (6/3/8/4/15) 3.6
