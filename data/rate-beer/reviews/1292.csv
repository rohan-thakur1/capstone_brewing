1292,"2009-01-28",3.9,"22oz brown glass pry-top w/out freshness date.

Appearance: A moderately hazy amber/brown with light tan head and no lacing.

Nose: Hop-candy. Pale malty sweetness combined with light citrus and a slight floral note. Candied orange comes to mind.

Palate: Medium-bodied and much more malty than I anticipated. Slick mouth-feel is then overtaken by hop-sharpness on the finish. Medium-caramel malt notes (like an alt) mingle with the citrus qualities of the hops and a little fruitiness from the yeast, and then are taken by the dry, bitter hops, and a little dried cannabis-like note on the finish.

Notes: A slightly off-balance bitter, if only because it seems like its just an exaggerated recipe. Its both big on the fruity notes and big on the bitter. Tasty and sessionable.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","SFLpunk"

She pours a burnt amber into my glass with a smidgen of a head which settles into a thin ring around my glass with little tufts of foam floating around on top. I love it when I can swirl my beer and she suds up nicely which Younger’s Special Bitter does. Brussels lace follows their way back down into the brew leaving the sides of the glass clean. The nose is resplendent with sweet malt notes: caramel, nuts, toffee, and a bit of freshly roasted rye bread. A bit of lemon lingers in the back, hinting at a pleasant hop balance to this special bitter. Smooth on the tongue and in the mouth. A medium-light body with little carbonation. Instead it flows like velvet with an almost creamy, buttery palate as it caresses and coats my mouth. Delicate malt character with particularly bright sweet nut and caramel flavors. The lemon hops I smelled in the nose give Younger’s Special Bitter a clean bite which works very well to balance the malts. A lingering bitterness and hints of malted nuts in the aftertaste. An interesting balance of mildly sweet malt notes, nuts, a buttery yet not too heavy body or mouthfeel which is given vibrancy and spark by a crisp bitter lemon hop bite.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

1292,"2006-06-12",3.1,"Any first impressions?
-A ring sits around the unfiltered dark orange.
-Shining resinous, wooden, herbal hops are muddled by the prevalent yeastiness.
-Caramel maltiness and walnuts are bothered by the manipulative yeast presence.
-You end up with the impression of a uniform flavoring in a near-flaccid mouthfeel.

What if you dig deeper?
-Wooden hop bitterness flattens out, as the yeast takes over the finish.
-The citrus fruit doesnt manage to alleviate the yeasty sweetness.
-This American take on the bitter style must be better when you get a cleaner bottle.

Soapy, citrusy, herbal and fruity (lemonade, honeymelon) hops nose is muted by the strongly yeasty profile comprising unfortunate metallic leanings. Otherwise, rather typical American crystal malts give a good sweet, almost toasty backbone that is competently attenuated. Powerful carbonation removes a bit from the English aspirations, making for a not quite aggressive, but certainly tongue-biting factor that cuts the flavour short.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Smells a little sweet, when i first poured it i was a little put off by the smell because it was kind of pleasant, but I didnt want it to taste like that.  Not to worry, it starts off with a nice bitter citrus hop flavor that matures into a slighly floral bitter, as it goes down you get this really nice kick of caramel at the end.

1292,"2005-10-18",3.2,"18-Oct-05 (22 oz bottles: $4 at Issaquah Brewery in Issaquah, WA) While visiting breweries all around the Pacific Northwest, I found bottles of Fat Heads Ale and Cliff Hanger Ale at the Issaquah Brewery, and since I collect bottles, I figured Id get these beers for my collection, even if they are the same beer as the Youngers Special Bitter.  I suspect my review of Youngers from 16 months ago is a bit off, which is part of the reason why Im doing a new rating here.  Even though Im not directly comparing them with the Youngers, I can definitely confirm that Fat Head and Cliff Hanger taste exactly the same.  Theyre mildly fruity, lightly sweet and toasty, and gently bitter though the bitterness tends to be the slightly dominant aspect.  Theres also a mild tartness in the background.  The nose is fairly toasty and dry, with a grassy aroma.  Medium bodied, and the carbonation levels are about average for beer.  Hazy, dark amber in color.  The off-white head pours pretty tall, and retention is solid, holding a thin layer for the entire session, although the Cliff Hanger is holding a good quarter-inch or more, and the lacing for that beer is wonderfully ringed.  Overall, this isnt bad, but still pretty mediocre by Rogue standards, and far from being one of my favorites.16-Jun-04 (22 oz bottle: Whole Foods in San Diego/Hillcrest) Like the Fullers ESB, the nose is woody and malty, and the flavor is fairly malty and fairly sweet, but that is where the similarities end.  The key difference is that this medium bodied ESB has the classic strong hops bitterness toward the finish that is typical of Rogue beers, and it tends to overpower the malt at that point.  The flavor also lacks any fruitiness.  There is also a fair amount of hoppiness in the nose.  Bright amber color.  Off-white head has excellent retention, but leaves only a modest amount of lacing.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
1292,"2005-10-17",3.2,"Picked up one of these in the discount singles bin at Sams Quickshop.  This is probably the best beer Ive found in the discount bin there before.  Generally I prefer IPAs to ESBs, but this beer definitely held its own.  Deep honey color, kind of opaque, not a whole lot of bubbles, but a creamy off-white head.  Aroma is sweet (toffee, some fruit).  Flavor starts sweet, malty, and ends up with a pleasant, medium-to-high bitter.  The hops dont really stick around long though.  There is a bit of a metallic ness to the bitter unfortunately, and the palatte is a bit on the watery side.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Fish"

Ok, first we get some malt... a little like an English pale ale with Kent Goldings, but they taste more like Fuggles.  Not overwhelming, but an Ok brew.  No real sweet maltiness to match the bitter.  Not very balanced.  Too much sour and bitter.  Overrated, probably because it has the Rogue name on it.  Worst one Ive had from them, but still not terrible.","Sligo","pjk33"

Taste is nice and mild, welcoming warm toasty malts favor from front to back. Some refined and soft malt sweetness of breads and dull fruit keep it smooth and tolerable to the palate. Theres a nice subtlety about its approach. Floating and caring malt character with the same amount of comfort with the hop profile which has very slight floral, citrus, and pine mindfully placed in different areas throughout the palate. Feel is light and fluffy with a firm and sturdy, smoother lighter body. Which seems to fit this here, making for a nice little drinker.

Nice and hoppy initial mouthfeel. Wonderful, doughy finish. Perhaps not sweet enough to be truly fine. Wonderful mouth feel, and a nice, long, pine-hop finish that is not harshly hoppy. For a brewer that makes such great painted label bottles, their paper label on this one is quite attractive. I could polish off a few of these in a sitting. Perhaps a little too hoppy to be a session brew, but it comes about as close as you could expect for a beer with this many IBUs.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"

1292,"2003-05-30",3.4,"Same beautiful color as Carlow Moling's Tradional Celtic beer. Lovely, crystal clear amber brew with orange highlights. Medium-sized, lightly-tanned, frothy head. Somewhat lasting with excellent lacework.
The nose is moderately malty and hoppy with wonderful notes of English toffee and caramel; flowers, evergreen and white pepper.
Perfectly balanced flavor up front with bursts of caramel, English toffee, butter, herbs and grass. The hops win out on the backside with a very pleasant, moderately bitter jab to my right eye. That's gonna leave a mark!
Light-bodied with a silky mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Lengthy, coppery, bitter and dry finish with a hefty dose of earth and evergreen wood at the wee end.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

1292,"2003-05-10",3.7,"That was very pleasant indeed! It pours a medium red, orange core with a dark yellow surrounding..fairly cloudy and a pearl white head which lasted 2-3 minutes. The aroma is filled with crystal malts..especially sweet with vanilla and caramel and a slight hint of peaches. The flavor has a definite peach/nectarine quality with vanilla and caramel crystal malt. It gets hoppy/bitter right in mid taste with a nice dry ending. Very malty dry ending...quite palatable with a low level of carbonation. Im happy! :)","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"

Pleasant aroma--very English--malty, slightly tart with hints of toffee and apples. Mild front. Medium bodied. Only the finest touch of carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel. A fruity malt backbone stands up well against a slightly dry, bitter, hoppy finish. Mild and exceedingly well balanced. Much better than many of Rogue's more visible brews.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Sweet hoppy aroma, citrusy, cascade maybe.  I like the painted bottles better than the paper labels because there are the bitterness units and ingredients and all.  Nice bitter flavor, not overdone.  Lots of hoppy flavor.  Floral and citrus.  Overall good, but I would have thought this would have been more bitter.","Denver, Colorado, USA","AustinMilbarge"

1292,"2003-03-10",4.0,"Very nice. A ""rounded"" hoppiness. It has the full bitter flavour of a highly hopped beer without that sharpness that makes you burp up bitterness or a week.

This is somewhat out of style, but it tastes very good.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

1292,"2003-01-21",3.7,"For what it is called, i was expecting a bitter brew, something along the lines of the anderson valley esb.  What i received was a very nice smelling brew(ipa-ish) but the taste was very very malty, not bitter at all.  I think its a great brew, but definately not really a bitter, more like their american amber ale without the hop bite.  Definately something i will try again.

Clear amber coloured body with ruby highlights. Aroma of caster sugar, light hops, cardboard and not much nice. Light-bodied; Funky sweet, nutty flavour that isn't pleasant. Aftertaste bitter, but not impressive. Overall, not great...and from this fact alone-we know it's a Rogue beer! I sampled this 65 cL bottle on 15-May-2004 at the May RB Party in Toronto, Ontario.

1292,"2002-07-15",3.7,"YSB is fairly commonly found on cask at Summits Wayside Tavern in Sandy Springs, GA, an unincorporated town that borders Atlanta to the north. Its usually on the beer list, but if you catch it in between casks, it may not actually be there. I was lucky this time and actually got a chance to try it (the last two times I was unsuccessful). The head was a thick meringue-like white foam and fought to stay around until the very end. When the beer had been brought out the head was perfect. By the time I finished my other beer and got around to tasting this one a few minutes later, it was still perfect. Even on the last few sips, the head was still there, seeming to stay in proportion to the rest of the contents of the glass. Im not a big fan of ESBs, though. I really liked Fullers with its rich maltiness. YSB seems more aggressively hopped (the hops came across as spicy/peppery) and less malty than the Fullers.

Grassy and floral. Dry and clean. Light toasty malt balance. Very clean and hoppy, but this needs more malt depth to be considered a solid ESB. Finishes drier and lightly fruity, with hints of nectarine juice. Decent, but lacking by Rogues standards. Even considering its their original.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"
1292,"2002-05-07",4.1,"Wonderful interpretation of the style, with Rogues tradmark firmly stamped on it. Hoppier than most Bitters, but thats a good thing!!","Asheville, North Carolina, USA","groovinhigh"
1292,"2002-04-15",3.7,"Weird aftertaste. Hoppy and bitter. Another great Rogue Product.","East Norriton, Pennsylvania, USA","Drinkingdan"
1292,"2002-04-07",4.0,"autumn oak leaves orange- russet in color; it has no more head than it has hooves, but makes up for it with a typically rogue-like burgeoning bouquet of sweet woody notes, almost like a haywagon in a nice dried grassy way. toasty, some bourbon, touch of fruit, apricot perhaps. great bitterness, dryer than expected, brisk body at first, finishes mellow.  typical rogue, which is to say: excellent.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"
1292,"2002-03-28",2.7,"nice hoppy aroma, not enough bitterness in the flavor. bit of a sweet perfumey aftertaste.","Davenport, Iowa, USA","igneous1"
1292,"2002-03-26",3.3,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2005 Im not sure how Rogue manages to support so many labels in its protfolio but it seems that every time I go to the store theres a new one. Many follow the same theme Rogue Red, Santas Reserve, Brutal Bitter and now YSB. Great aroma in this one, piney hops, woodsy, faint hints of smoke. Flavor is interesting with sweet caramel malts at the front that quickly gets overshadowed by a hop bitterness that runs throughout. Finishes with a good citric bitter quench. Another top rate Rogue, but having tried several similar brews from them nothing too exciting. [Update: once again typically Rogue, was disappointed to pick up Cliff Hanger and find it was the same brew, 2 points down on the overall for this reason, sorry guys, just be more honest, turning from a most loved brewery to a disliked brewery quickly]","California, USA","BeerLimey"
1292,"2002-03-26",4.2,"Wow! I am Lucky! Two good beers in a row (First Shoals Pale, now this one) Not too bitter, but with qa crisp aftertaste. Slightly cloudy, highly carbonated, Medium head, and orangish color. Crisp yet has a bit of complexity to it.... hints of allspice, carrot or cinnamon?  Will gladly buy more of it... I have just discovered how great Rogue beers are, and look forward to buying more oft hem in the future. A great beer, worth finding.","Toledo, Ohio, USA","LuckeyHaskins99"
1292,"2002-03-21",3.1,"Tangerine-amber color with a moderate foamy head. This english bitter has a most fruity/peachy hoppiness which becomes more flavorful as the beer warms.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
1292,"2002-03-11",3.5,"ESB... more like IPA.  Very floral aroma (American hops??) with a tough of malt.  As the beer warms, the malt begins to show itself behind the significant hop flavors.  Finishes very crisp and bitter.  Deep copper color with minimal head.  A good beer, but not top notch.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

1292,"2002-02-06",4.5,"Closest thing to a true english bitter around here.  Smooth, and you can drink many of these due to the low carbonation and less sweetness.","Corvallis, Oregon, USA","ttboy8099"
1292,"2002-01-24",3.8,"I had always considered this to be a lost beer in Rogues immense portfolio.  But when I had it last night, it opened my eyes.  Here was a hoppy but well-balanced session bitter that Id ignored far too often.  There arent any surprises here, but the rich, earthy bitterness and sound fundamental structure make this a lovely ale.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

1292,"2001-10-24",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 29, 2006 Clear light copper.  Off white foam of sticky froth.  Slightly subdued aroma of leaf, light phenol, lemon zest, buttery pale malts, and a touch of nuttiness.  Well carbonated palate, buttery, and round.  Intense buttered malts are all over the place and are perfectly complimented by earthy, hop leaf undertones.  The malt profile here is exquisite, which seems to linger for an eternity.  Slight phenolic aroma is its only downfall.  Regardless a textbook bitter.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

1292,"2001-09-06",3.7,"Bold yet refined, featuring a hoppy, fruit aroma, lots of floating yeast, and a cloudy, red-brown body.  Primary flavors are hops with some apple crispness.  Bitter finish witha head that lasts throughout.  Quite good.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"

1292,"2001-06-16",3.6,"Another great Ale from Rogue...strong apple flavor followed by a nice dose of hops that sticks around for awhile. The bitterness is balanced very well by the fruity flavor.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
1292,"2001-05-13",3.9,"Another fairly good offering from Rogue.  Good hop aroma and flavor.  Balanced mouthfeel with malt on the base of the tongue and hops on the side.  Just the right amount of carbonation.  Also passed the true test of a great brew, that being, as it got warmer, it got better!  Went well with the chicken and cheese hoagie I was enjoying with it.","Acworth, Georgia, USA","billb"
1292,"2000-12-13",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2003 For American bitters, this pretty much takes the cake.  Balanced extraordinarily, and refreshing.  Has just the right amount of haze to it, too.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
