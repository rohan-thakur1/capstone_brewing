944,"2014-11-19",3.1,"It tastes like a Pale Ale, but of course, it is not. The oats really come through in the aroma and palate.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","bpreo"
944,"2014-10-11",3.7,"Draught at St. Augustines, VancouverCloudy light amber color with creamy head. Mild oat aroma. Lean body, but the mouthfeel is sweet and a bit chewy; good malts and hops here, quite fruity too, with strong bitterness level.Very nice.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
944,"2014-08-25",3.2,"On tap @ Alibi Room. Amber pour with a white head. Bready malts and a touch of caramel on the nose. Quite toasty, too. A lot of floral and grassy hops. Some apple, a light citrus note, and some yeast. Taste is on the sweet side though there is a decent bitterness to it. Some cracker along with lots of bread and toast. Slightly floral hop profile with a fair bit of grass. Kind of a strange aftertaste as it warms a bit...maybe banana?","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
944,"2014-08-15",3.6,"Amber and hazy, thin head, floral hop, little chewy, touch of alcohol, really nice balance. On the palate, sweet front, again some nice floral hop, balanced crackery, slightly biscuity amber malt and the alcohol gains in prominence as you go. Odd on paper but a decent brew in practice. Its the second time lately Ive had an "" imperial california common"" and theyve both been pretty good.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
944,"2014-08-12",3.1,"On tap at St. Augustines, pours a cloudy darker orange with a small beige head. Aroma is pretty muffled, maybe some bready malts in there. Flavour is sharp, with lots of dry hops for the style - secondary notes of dry biscuity malt. Very dry palate with lots of bitterness on the finish. Not true to style by any means, but still nice.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
944,"2014-07-07",3.5,"At base camp with Steven. Pours orange murky bronze with him white lacing. Aroma is wheat wine sweetness, heavy earthy hops not bitter. Taste is full flavored Vienna malt, smooth, sweet light wheat in the background.","Dallas, Texas, USA","Experiment_Ale"
944,"2014-07-07",3.7,"On tap at the brewery. Pour is clear orange with a frothy tan head and great lacing. Fruity hoppy, orange peel, caramelly, bready, lemons, grass and sweet cookie malt in the aroma. Taste is fresh grapefruit, lemons, biscuit, doughy, grassy, and straw with a light bitter finish. Medium body with high carbonation. Really tasty stuff.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
944,"2014-06-20",3.4,"Golden in color clear with a thin white head. Nice easy drinking California common. This was a huge Oatmeal beer like the flavor and finish.","Olympia, Washington, USA","BrewDad"
944,"2014-06-09",3.7,"Sampled at the brewpub - Pours orange with a light haze and white head. The aroma has grapefruit, toasty malt, smoothness and noticeable alcohol. It has a medium / full body with semi-soft carbonation. The flavor starts out with toasty malt, harsh hoppiness and earthy/grapefruit notes. The finish is resiny, but smoothed out with a mal balance. Really nicely done.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
944,"2014-06-08",3.4,"On draught at base camp - pours bright copper with medium thick head. Nose is of strong grain - on the unpleasant side. Fortunately the taste makes up for smell with balanced sweet malt, grain, and bitter grass.

944,"2014-05-07",3.8,"At the brewery. Pours a clear copper color with a medium white head. A big fresh hop nose. An odd beast, but basically an IPA at heart with fresh fruity hops, medium bitterness, earthy finish. Very drinkable.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
