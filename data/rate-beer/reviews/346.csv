Pours hazy blond with low white head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is of fruits, funk, apricots. Taste is of acidity, sourness, apricots. Palate: Medium body, medium carbonation.

346,"2016-06-25",3.8,"Pours a hazy golden with no head and no lacing. Nose is of cheese, light oak and wine. Taste is tart and winey as well, oaky. White wine. Not quite a gueuze but still really enjoyable for what it is. Body is light to medium, carbonation moderate and I found it to be a little too puckering. A pretty good De Garde and a nice blended american sour.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

346,"2015-08-30",4.1,"Poured from a bottle courtesy of Snuffy. 
Aroma is slightly poopy, but it blows off. Nice tropical fruit notes with some lighter stone fruit character. Light oak notes with some citrus notes as well. Faint musty notes. Some light peppery phenolics.
Pours a hazy, pale golden hay color with a small, white head that quickly disappears. No lacing and small legs.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a pretty decent sour. Similar to DDG but acidity is a bit sharper and it has some de Garde funk.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

White wine, tannins, de grade yeasty tones, barrel character with a floral chemical tone. Fruity ending. Light medium body with a subtle tartness like a mellow lemon. Nice balancing act between sweet and sour and yeasty. Taste is citrusy fresh dominated by sweet lemony tones, de grade funk, and dried grasses. Floral and honey tones roll around with a bright white wine tone and barrel characteristics. Really good golden sour from de garde. Their best I've had yet.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
