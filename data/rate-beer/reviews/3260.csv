3260,"2016-02-29",3.3,"UPDATED: NOV 11, 2016 You havent been in Brugues if you havent been in De Garre and tasted this house beer of theirs, which has become something of an underground classic throughout the years. Very thick, rocky, dense, creamy, egg-white head, hazy peach blonde colour with slight ochre hue. Aroma of raw celery, bakers yeast, biscuit, caramel, canned peaches, jenever, some DMS (cooked cauliflower) and even DMTS (burnt rubber), banana, stewed rhubarb, cloves, white pepper, raw potato, young cheese, field flowers. Sweet onset, peach, banana, pear, pineapple with a sourish undercurrent, carbonation is medium and fit for the style; soft, fluffy caramelly and bready maltiness ensues, quite thick, with some spicy phenols on top. Finish continues this maltiness and adds a lot of slightly wry, jenever-like alcohol, lingering white candi sugar sweetness, earthy, herbal hops and that typical, somewhat wry Van Steenberge yeast bitterness. This is not the best tripel I had, not even the best Van Steenberge beer, so as far as Im concerned, this seems a bit overrated and overhyped. I have heard many theories concerning its true nature over the years: is it an original beer or not? My guess, which is as good as anyone elses, is that this is a refermented coupage of Augustijn Grand Cru with Piraat 10.5, or something close to that. Glad I tasted it, but I expected a bit more of it considering the - to me very clearly undeserved - hype.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

There are so many pleasing qualities about this beer - the aroma, the color, the glorious head...but, for me the thing that makes this beer stand out over others, not unlike the Westy XII, is the mouth feel.  Very 3D, the carbonation is sublimely tight and airy and the thick head mixes perfectly with the sweeter, creamy liquid as one drinks.  I highly recommend ordering one in Brugge if possible - Ive had this beer served in other locations (in the US) and it really does pale in comparison to the beer poured out of the wooden barrel at Staminee de Garre.

This brought me home, this is pretty much how I want my every day beer to taste. Pineapple and citrus, sherbert, very yeasty, some spice, little caramel. Also helps that it brings back memories of being sat in De Garre on my honeymoon. I loved this stuff. Very tasty and with the sheer knackers a good beer should have.

3260,"2005-01-04",4.0,"Draft: Gold with a lasting white large head. Malty (biscuity, caramel) aroma yet flowery and spicy too. Sweet caramel malt flavours in start with a clean spicy sugary finish. Very balanced and drinkable. Full bodied and smooth. Not as dry as I normally expect of a tripel, but a wonderful beer anyway!","Perth, Western Australia, AUSTRALIA","kook"
3260,"2004-12-22",4.6,"The only real way to have this appears to be from the glass in this tiny hard to find pub in Brugge. You can buy a 750ml bottle and glass for 20 euro but the fun is in the atmosphere. Thanks to Lonely Planet for helping me find this gem. This is an absolute beaut. At the ABV you would expect something OTT but it is brewed to such a great level of perfection that it has all the qualities of a fine Belgian tripel whilst having none of the potetnial cloying aftertaste or mouthfeel. There is caramel and smooth malts here excellently offset by the right amount of bitterness. Certainly one of the best draught beers I have ever had and a true star in a country where the competition is as common as frites with mayonnaise (ergh).","Potts Point, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA","Sully"
3260,"2004-11-13",4.3,"Draught, at de Garre, Brugge, Belgium. 
Bright golden body adorned, crowned even with a wonderful full, supper smooth and super creamy white head. It has been 4 maybe 5 years since I have had this beer and fare better then I ever remember (such is the pleasure that ratebeer has given me). I had more then one of these treasures and on both Saturday and Sunday. The richness and smoothness of the first sip is quite something to behold. Sweat bitterness is controlled and fortified by an underlying sourness.  Rich and decadent this is one of the best beers and beer experiences for a beer hunter to have. Dont overlook this little treasure when in Brugge.","Sydney, Greater London, AUSTRALIA","Spiesy"
3260,"2004-10-28",4.0,"Draft in Brugge, Belgium. Body was carbonated and transparent with a yellow gold hue. Aroma was malty, fruity, spicy and some coriander. Sweet, malty, hoppy and spicy flavor. Tingly mouthfeel. Good lacing. Well worth trying.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
3260,"2004-10-08",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2004 The DM & Hotstuffs European Honeymoon trip beer number 31. This bottled brew from the De Garre pub in Brugge poured a large sized  head of white colored foamy finely sized bubbles that left behind a transparent golden orange colored body and an excellent lacing.  The aroma was very nice with strong vinous malty notes and the mouth feel was also strongly vinous and malty then smoothened in the finish.  The vinous flavor contained notes of mild coriander fruit and malts.  This was a very tasty brew that I enjoyed a lot.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
3260,"2004-10-03",3.8,"Draft at Staminee de Garre. Peachy colored amber with a strong foamy white head. Nose is fruity and sweet with strong spice and light floral notes. Taste is spicy and yeasty with sweet malts, candy sugar and a nice hop bite. Body is lively carbonation with a spicy and hoppy bite. Finishes with fruit and hops and some carbonation bite. Light floral notes as well. Good beer!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
3260,"2004-09-21",3.1,"(draught) Orange-golden beer; mass of very fine yellow-tinted head. Very meaty, yeasty notes in the nose, strong estery smelling, maybe touch of coriander. Extremely scorched & alcoholic taste (would have guessed Huyghe!), bits of cookie malt, quite aggressive and sharp. Probably lots of sugar. Some citrus in the aftertaste. Alcoholburn, medium to well-bodied. Served - of course - from a ""small, secret brewery""... Not very distinctive.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
