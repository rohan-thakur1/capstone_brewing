2129,"2015-02-20",2.7,"Typical English golden ale with stable, moussy, irregular, snow white head over a very slightly hazy (but cloudy with deposit), ochre blonde beer with very subtle olive green hue. Unusual and, frankly, not too inviting aroma of biscuit and toasted bread, green olives, cervil soup, melting rubber, grass, buttermilk, crushed weeds, caramelized witloof, candied apricot, bread dough, raw Brussels sprouts, earth, old cake. Taste begins rather neutral (as usual in this style), some subdued fruitiness (cucumber, unripe berries), medium carbonation, grainy sourishness with even a slightly drying effect, somewhat yeasty and starchy but not overly so, rather thin body as expected, mineral water, toasted maltiness appearing quickly but not as much as in many darker coloured beers, bready, all restraining from actual sweetness and managing to do that very well; in the finish, a relieving, leafy and earthy, low hop bitterness appears, lasting quite long, with a bready, in fact almost sourdough-like graininess piercing through it all; this mild but persistent hop bitterness (fortunately) stays with you as the last impression, but remains too subtle to save the day.  I may have stumbled upon an old bottle - clearly this style is intended to be consumed fresh - but I must say, I expected more from this, this is actually quite unbalanced, boring and strange in a not very appealing kind of way...

Spicy hops and lightly honeyed malts are joined by citrus throughout this polished, quenching Golden Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam laces nicely atop the golden gown.
-The mouthfeel and flavour rendering are very professional. Smooth, creamy, bright and defined.
-The hops could be more characterful, or the body drier.
-The finish is balanced and delicate.
-Malts could be crunchier.
-Ill have to have this again from a different source, as I hope to see what the fuss is all about. This cask could have been a bit tired?

I finally tracked down a bottle of this liquid gold and having tried it understand the fuss. This is truly one of the best low gravity beers in the world hands down. Instead of throwing in lots of hops or a heavy malt bill it succeeds by balancing a soft mouthfeel with rich flavor. I will definitely be buying some to take home.

Aroma / Appearance - The golden body is radiant like a morning sunrise. Accompanying it is a crisp white head the color of bleached clothes. Fruity hops and lemon crisp smell like an open airy white wine. Bright and intense it strikes that perfect balance between ""too much"" and ""not enough.""

Flavor / Palate - Lemons and rosy hops sweeten the palate which begs for more. The sweetness turns dry over time until it rests on the back of the throat. A reasonable amount of finish makes it easy to remember the flavor profile without hanging like a cloud of smog. The bitterness is right on the razors edge of perfection. I would love to see some US brewers try to pull this off (like Stone or Against the Grain).","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Golden, honey blond with a small whisp of a white head, which stayed for a while then left the scene. 

Very floral in aroma, almost perfumed, not to my liking really. 

Nothing great about its taste considering it did so well again this year with CAMRA awards. 

All in all, a big disappointment for me, no real flavour to get hold of, I couldnt detect the Grapefruit, Melon or Pineapple hints, which it is supposed to have. The pub I had it in, is well known for its beer quality, so I dont think it was cellermanship that let the beer down.
