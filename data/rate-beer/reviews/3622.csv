3622,"2011-07-04",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2011 1) Cask handpull, The Stable Bar, Monsal Head Hotel, Monsal Head, Derbyshire. Resolving straw thick and milky with condition. Delicate lemony, wood sap, fresh hop aroma like the sticky dried hopcone Octo just found in the hedgerow, but with fresh lychee hints as the head subsides. Deep stewed spicy hop tea flavour with a lingering smoked creaminess. Hints of celery and bacon. Complex malt and hops, perfectly dovetailed. Beautiful. 848416=4. 
2) Hand-pulled by myself, Wolvey village hall, Wolvey- the afternoon after my wedding reception. And at least a gallon the night before. Different beer to in Derbyshire..even better. Aroma of pineapple jelly and cream, satsumas, lightly mouldy, grapefuit and lemonade. Pungent, resinous, almost shocking marmalade and tonic bitterness softening into satsuma and rich tea biscuit. Utterly brilliant pale gold soaked with condition and lace. Packed with hops and malt, character and sessionabilty. For me everything thats pure, sociable and beautiful about English beer compressed into a pint glass. Got me through the most stressful and emotional 15mins of my life- my grooms speech. Cheers Buxton.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"
