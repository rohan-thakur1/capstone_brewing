1120,"2016-12-29",4.5,"From notes. Enjoyed this at Mickeys 30th birthday bash on November 05. 375 mL bottle. Batch 6. The pour on this is a bright clear-ish golden yellow with a thin ring of white head that vanishes quickly. The aroma on this is really efffing good. There is a bright peach and a ton of funkiness to it. Just a bright sourness that makes my mouth water. The flavor is much of the same. Beautifully tart and crisp with a lingering sourness that just makes you want to dive in for more. There isnt a lot of complexity, but a subtle fruitiness on the tartness and light sour really make this awesome. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a great lingering sourness that is just clenching enough. Damn, I want to bathe in this.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
1120,"2016-11-02",4.2,"375mL bottled 3/25/15, drunk 10/16/16, thanks to JoeT for the trade.Beige head is medium-sized and fairly dense, with strong retention for a sour. Light ruby-golden body shows high clarity with the sediment left behind.Cherries, oak, vanilla, light balsamic notes and lots of toffee lingering makes for a very light rendition of a flemish sour. But more of the golden variety; like Petrus Aged Pale, perhaps. Funky barnyard deftly integrated and theres plentiful berry, cherry, apple and strawberry esters keeping it bright and lively and taking the focus from the strong acidity. Malts seem well-attenuated but still present and the oak contributes a bit of vanilla and tannin, without any strong toastiness. No alcohol or flaw.Even, soft, malty body with ample caramel-vanilla and lots of strong brett acids that give way to lactic and light acetic notes, as well. Fine carbonation keeps it light and the acid is lightly puckering on the finish. Very fruity and yet still balanced if leaning towards fairly acidic/sour. Yogurt, light barnyard lots of cherry-like acetic character and soft wood tannin linger on pleasantly. Its been soooo long since Ive had Batch 1/Ph1 but this seems to be very competent and enjoyable still.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1120,"2016-10-15",4.5,"Review #2000. Yay! 375 ml bottle. Bottled on 011012 (batch 5). The beer is a bright, clear gold. No haze apparent at all - I was rather gentle with the bottle. The head is fairly small and pure white. Some lacing, bubbles stick around for a good amount of time. The aroma has nice brett funk depth on top of a lacto-forward sourness and a pleasantly sweet herbal flavor. Theres good fruity complexity in there with notes of pineapple, lemon, apple, grape, cherry and blackberry. The barrel imparts a solid vinous flavor and moderate oakiness. Light dusty, farmhouse note in the background. The taste is dry and medium sour. Its still firmly tart, but I think this is a somewhat less sour batch of Beatification, though. Lots of barrel character comes through. The finish is woody and vinous with very mild oaky bitterness. Mouthfeel is light enough but still pretty round for a relatively low abv sour. Theres some body to it. Nice clean finish, though. Medium pucker. This is one of my favorite American sours, just a wonderful beer. Its strange that its taken me so long to review it.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Good dose of white peppery funk, but its not anywhere near as strong as the best Belgian lambics. First sip is tart, quite tart. Loads of lemon tang to it. Fades quickly, though. Wheat and hay permeate the flavor as it fades to a peppery funk in the end. Again, its not moldy cheese funky or nasty sweaty feet sock funky, but its a touch funky. Finishes crisply and without a puckering sour flavor. It actually retains a bit of a sweetness. Just a hint. Lingering flavors are excellent. This is a well crafted beer.

Pours sparkling clear light gold with tons of small bubbles clinging to the side of the glass. Aroma brings oak, vinegar, leather, and tons of white wine. Taste is holy wow bracingly tart. Sweet tarts, puckering, almost difficult to drink its so tart. Gonna have to take this slow. Lots of grape. Some apple cider. Medium body, slick coating texture, lively carbonation. Overall: This is surprisingly unimpressive (I mean, still quite good, but not 100th percentile good). Over the top sweet tart. Different than the older one by quite a bit, and almost not in the same class. Is this age, or batch variation, or something else entirely? 8/4/7/4/15. (3.8)  
 
Older bottle (batch 2, thanks Carl!): Murky cloudy pour, darker gold, no head, minimal carbonation. Lovely complex gueuze-like nose -- cob webs, rubber, musty basement, cheese, funk - theres maybe a little oak left, but not much, and also the grapes/wine have receded to nothingness. Taste brings some light sweetness with a really nice funky, fruity tartness. Less residual sugar in this dude, and everything just gels better. Could totally mistake this for one of the Belgians.

The aroma is compexity perfected...green apples, barnyard funk, sweet & sour, but not nearly as much sour as is in the taste...almost overpowers the other things going on, but not quite...and your palate adjusts as you go! the difference between this and flemish reds and browns is that this is a blonde, but you couldnt tell by the body. Creamy lactose body, although fairly highly carbonated. Had to agitate quite a bit just to get some white-ish head atop the cloudy bright yellow body.

Sourness gets unleashed on the palate in a wild way, tartness, lemon peel and unripe grapes, along with hints of orange and apple. Straw and wooden malt feather the sourness a bit, which still comes along pretty untameable. Sweet orange stays in a sharp contrast to zingy citrus, along with vinegar and Bretts lingering on the palate. High level of acidity is outstanding, chewy and raw, resulting in a very dry and crisp ending.

rerate:

Beatification batch 5

Pours a filtered, light yellow color and a fizzy, bubbly head, immediately dissapearing into small sheets of lacing.

Lower carbonated, with a very refreshing mouthfeel to it, due to fresh lemons and a balancing, wooden oak infusion. 

The aromas unfold just after popping open the bottle, filling the air in my room with a lovely, citrussy funkiness. Reveals even more ripe, juicy citrus when smelling at the actual beer, together with an immense tartness, bedded on glue, yogurt and old leather. Creates an interesting interplay between dough, soft old malts and prickly, crisp lemon, without becoming intriguingly complex.

The taste offers a good amount of lemon right from the very beginning, accompanied by easing, bready, musty malts and fermented wheat. Lemons get increasingly more body added, resulting in a very sour, funky tartness, almost numbing the front of my tongue during its peak. Finishes fruity, with fresh pressed lemons, revealing even lemon stones, as for how pronounced the fruit acidity gets, offering an acceptable dryness. 

The balancing oaky barrel vanishes completely during the beers finish, opening the palate up to pure, sour fruit lemonade. Hammers a bit too hard on the palate, regarding its acidic sourness, preventing the beer from showcasing its other, more subdued flavors.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Flavor is fruity at first, with the green apple, pineapple, very faint melon. Once the fruit plays out the sour kicks in, and its definitely a cheek turner. The funk is on the lower spectrum with more citrus coming through. Almost candied-lemon. Once it warms out more of the oak comes through the taste. The body is somewhat full for a sour, with high carbonation. The finish is citrus forward with sharp tartness that lingers. Though, the sour quality seems a bit more extreme as it warmed, it was surprisingly well balanced for a majority of the glass.

Upon popping the cork and sticking my nose at the bottle neck, my initial response was to say aloud, while alone, ""Why the shit is this not a regular?! Get your shit together Vinnie.""

This is a crispy golden beer with a solid, fluffy, white cap and a resilient central emission of carb rises from the bottom. Lemon zest, manure, hay, arugula, horse hair, soil, yogurt and hell yeah emit from the aqueous solution. One of the most tart beers Ive tasted, lemon juice, hints of bitterness, mud, weed roots, dandelion - this beer is insane. Medium bodied with higher carb than Id prefer (easily remedied with the amount of shaking and whiffing Im doing) and a semi dry, yet mouth watering finish.

1120,"2013-11-20",4.5,"Batch 5 - 011012 375mL bottle.
Aroma is great with a big barnyard funkiness and medium lactic acidity note. Hints of an herbal character are present and there is a faint oak note. Light fruit esters of cherry and pineapple. A really nice aroma - not truly gueuze-like but similar with a nice American sour quality to it.
Pours a cloudy pale yellow gold with a medium sized, thin, white head that recedes fairly quickly but a thin film lingers and is replenished by rising bubbles. No leaving our legs.
Flavor is very sour, more aggressive than most gueuzes. Medium low barnyard funkiness with a lot of citrus acidity. Some moderate herbal character with medium light oak notes. Fairly complex but lacking some of the fruitiness that the aroma had. Faint cherry and pineapple. 
Mouthfeel is medium light to light bodied with medium high carbonation. Low acidic astringency and low to medium low alcohol warmth.
Overall if you are comparing this to a gueuze Beatifaction would lose but it is an amazing sour. The beer has a lot of similarities to a traditional gueuze but with a bit more acidity and an American twang to it. It lacks the gracefulness that traditional beers have, but has more complexity and is more enjoyable than almost any American sour out there.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

I believe this is the sourest beer I have ever had. All sorts of acid, too: acetic, lactic and citric. This wasnt as polished as I thought it would be and a far cry from a good gueuze.

Getting the flaws out of the way, the aroma picks up a bit too much of the brett funky oddness and it is a tiny bit too sharp. Moving on, I can only say good things about it. An amazing brew, very sour with very little malt presence and the tartness overrides. A great and very clean malt ride along in the background to remind that this isnt some sort of wild cider. The base beer is perfect to support the wall of flavors created by the yeast n friends. Pretty damn funky. To top it off, very cool that it is fermented with local critters - a whole new level to drinking local.","USA","Nik925"
1120,"2013-10-01",4.6,"Batch 5, poured into HF Goblet 7-17-13 at 45-50 degrees. Reviewed over the course of an hour.

A- Pours a copper orange color with a fluffy white head that appears to be churning from the vigorous carbonation, almost as if it were boiling. Fairly cloudy appearance. The head falls quickly leaving a ring around the edge of the glass, and minimal lacing. 

S- I could smell how sour this thing was as soon as I popped the cork. Upon closer inspection, there are orange, lemon and apricot notes blended in with wet dirt, barnyard. and an amazing smelling yeast character that rounds it all out. It smells incredibly inviting.

T- Very sour right up front, dominated by lemon character. As the lemon fades, layers of funky barnyard, yeasty goodness, and a very enjoyable oak presence take over. The oak dries out the finish and leaves you wanting more of the fruit and funk character from the beginning. 

M- Nice prickly carbonation is right on for style. This beer certainly has a mouth feel of its own, that being an insane level of mouth puckering, sweat inducing sourness. The oak dries out everything at the end, yet isnt overpowering to the point where you feel like you need a sip of water to get rid of the cottonmouth. It is getting pretty close to that though...

O- Wow- I knew this would be good, but I didnt expect it to be this good. This beer is the definition of a beautifully crafted wile ale. Do whatever you can to get this beer, it is amazing.","","justforrazors"

1120,"2013-04-12",4.3,"Pours a beautiful golden apricot color with a thin creamy white head. Smells of an authentic gueuze, beautiful. Rich, sweet, sour, fresh. This nears the perfection of Drie Fonteinen. Buttery, silky, creamy smells mingle with crisp, sour apricots, apples, blood orange.  That juicy, zesty sweetness brings an exciting twist, not something I would expect from Brussels. Mouth-watering, though, and shows the terroir of the first true American lambic Ive ever smelled. Onto the palate and POW! That mouthfeel is intense. Carbonation is extremely fine, no fizz, more of a soft tingle accompanied by the punch of sourness. Again, big juicy apricot and blood orange are the surprising and welcome elements of this beer. This is the real deal. The flavors are intense, lambic-like certainly, but with their own dazzle. Rich, buttery, fruity. Beautiful sour raspberries appear as the beer opens up. As I drink it today, April 2013, this bottle (750ml batch #003) has lost some of its springy carbonation, but its safely among the best sour ales made today.

1120,"2012-11-03",3.7,"Batch 5. Clear golden with a thin white head that fades fairly quickly. Love the aroma - great combination of acidity/vinegar, funk, bit of barnyard, lemon zest, tart grapefruit. Mild carbonation and full acidic and vinegar body without much balance (puckering sour), become somewhat dry, so sour on the finish I almost get a bit of a sweetness. I guess I prefer my sours more like the aroma on this versus the incredibly vinegar palate that I get - not sure if it needs some more age of its just brewed this way but glad I got to try this.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"

The nose is light lemon peel and soft wood, some fruity sugars and light cheesy funk. The taste is funky fermenting apple skin, some sweet caramel and toffee. Theres a delicate acetic funk, notes of molding pear and grape. The beer grows more strongly acidic through the taste, with some citrus fruit coming through on the finish. Mild pillowy lactic flavors provide some depth. Medium body, smooth and quite drinkable, if tart. Overall, a very nice American sour. Pretty good.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"

1120,"2012-10-19",4.0,"C&C bottle served in a Deschutes tulip. Batch 5. Huge thanks again to Andrew (nasty31).

A: Pours with a light golden haze and frothy, airy white head. It recedes to a similar ring that leaves some splotches here and there.

S: Tartness and mild sourness. A mix of fresh tart fruit, mainly green apple and lemon grass with restrained funk.

T: Gueuze-ish with a slight restrained funk. Tart green apples, lemon grass, mild funk and some oak with a finish of vanilla sweetness that mixes with a little white grape sournes.

M: Zesty and spritzy. The body is light with a refreshing clean finish.

O: Delicious beer that borders on a gueuze IMO. If the funk wasnt so restrained in the backbround Id say this wasnt a wild ale, but very good none the less.

1120,"2012-10-12",3.8,"Poured into a tulip. Batch #5, bottled on 01/10/12.

3.0 A: Very faintly hazed concentrated urine color. Two and a half fingers of frothy white head. Retention is average at best and no lacing is left.

4.0 S: Pears, pears, and more pears. This is the peariest beer Ive ever smelled. Hay is the next most aggressive note. Moderately tart with more of the wild qualities being of the funk variety. Musty basement, dry-rotten sweatsocks, rotting wood, and dusty old barn. Lemon, vanilla, and oak to round this off. Its complex, but the aromas dont run very deep, if that makes any sense. 

4.5 T: Pears dominate the taste as well and it tastes great. Much more tart and acetic than the nose. Plenty of lemon and tart white grape with some lime underneath. The funk mentioned in the nose follows. The taste is both complex and deep. Its potent, yet quite refined. After having a bunch of Bruery sours lately, the quality of this one is that much more apparent. Although this is good and tart, its still nicely balanced.

4.0 M: Lighter medium body. Higher, but normal range, carbonation with a dry champagne-like spritziness as opposed to a sweet creaminess. Good here.

5.0 D: A couple categories were borderline with a higher score, so hence a 5.0 here. This is the first RR sour that has truly impressed me since I first had Tempation. Solid all around.

Nose is intensely funky and moderately acidic, with lots of the oak barrels showing off, lots of bretty funk, and some lambic-like tartness.

I wouldve thought such extreme tartness would make it undrinkable, but coupled with the oak barrels and the brett funk, the complexity is very high and the drinkability is quite high for a sour.

Beautiful lemon rind, oak, and slight soap at the beginning before a juicy rush of delicious grapefruit. Slight lactic acid bite with funk and plenty of lingering grapefruit. Its delightfully tangy, moderate acidity, mild funk, with mild lemon rind notes. Theres a gentle fade of the grapefruit, and the tang makes it lip-smacking good. I dont say this lightly: this is probably the best beer Ive ever had.

A - Pours hazy golden yellow with a small half finger tall white head leaving very small streaks of lace down a small portion of the glass.

S - Smells of lots of acidic sourness, white grape, lemons, green apples, oak and some barnyard funk. Batch #2 is mostly sourness at this point, Batch #3 has all the flavors in near perfect balance and  Batch #5 is probably the ""fruitiest"" of the three.

T - Starts off with an intense sourness that never really goes away. The fruit - the lemons, grapes and apples from the nose - combine with some musty barnyard funk and dry oak to offer some contrast  to the sourness but they can only do so much. Finish is quite dry, lingering on the palate long after consumption.

M - All three batches possess a light body with intense flavors and moderate to moderately low carbonation. Very sour, dry finish on all three batches.

O - All three of these were really awesome. My Batch #2 was definitely the most sour, Batch #3 was probably my favorite since it was the most balanced and Batch #5 just tasted a little raw compared to the other two. This was a seriously delicious test.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

Appearance: Pours a light honey gold with a 1-2 finger sudsy snow white head. There is a fair amount of sludgy buildup inside the bottle where the cork came out, but it doesnt seem to pour into the beer. The head dissipates quickly leaving a small ring around the edges before finally disappearing altogether. Little to no lacing once the head dissipates.

Smell: Tart, but not overpoweringly. There is a hint of barnyard funk to go along with apple cider, sweet white wine, lemon, vinegar and a touch of oak. Extremely complex aroma which balances sweetness with tartness.

Taste: Wow, thats one intensely tart array of flavors! Vinegar and wine grape hulls up front followed by sweet cider and touch of funk in the middle before ending with lemon zest and just a faint hint of oak. Aftertaste is bitter, tart and very dry with notes of earthiness, oak tannins and a little funk.

Mouthfeel: Light-to-medium-bodied with an very high amount of prickly carbonation. The mouth is coated by the puckering sourness.

Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. I could drink a lot of this beer if only I were lucky enough to have multiple bottles.

Still notes of lemon rind and some other citrus notes worked in.  Taste is tones of sour bite, some funky cheese elements and very dry compared to other RR sours.  All of this is based on the usual four, Supplication, Temptation, Consecration and Sanctification.  This is by far the best of those four from my experience, followed by Temptation.

Aroma is lemon, dry oak, sour, slight tart, and a definite cheese funk over a grainy malt presence and brett.  I do not get grapefruit but the sharp lemon and tart certainly suggests a sour citrus note.  Taste is tart, puckering, sour, grape rinds, cheese funk, lemon, and sharp tart reverberations through the finish.  The brett provides a nice dry backdrop but it does not get in the way of the other flavor components.  Mouthfeel is sharp and while not quite bone dry it has a clean presentation that showcases the tart/sour and funk very well.

A - Half-Finger head. Lacing is solid but dissipated to a very thin ring of carbonation almost instantly. Dark golden color, nice haziness, looks like a standard farmhouse style saison.

Beatification pours a dark, cloudy golden tangerine color with a small eggshell collar and no real lacing.

The aroma has some lactic and soft funky notes, but it is mostly sour. Lemon, peach, and grapefruit all provide the fruit tartness.

The flavor has an incredible sour flavor. It starts with lemon and grapefruit, with some peach, white grape, and a bit of cherry later on. Some grass and hay get lost with the light malt; if I really look for it I can get a little bit, but the tartness is overwhelming.

The carbonation and body are standard for the style, with an absolutely incredible tartness. Some light oak tannins dry it out a bit, but the sour is so deep and full that my mouth is constantly watering while I work through my glass.

The funkiness in the aroma is mouth-watering. Very tight, tart, and astringent mouthfeel on such a light, almost airy body. The sourness is overwhelming at first, but slowly fades and gives way to a plethora of tropical fruit flavors, pineapple and fresh lemons, a bit of earthiness, and tons of savory backbone to support it all. The finish is quite dry and yet complex; it reminds me a lot of a much more sour, wild Temptation with less champagne notes.

A ton of lemon zest, wet blanket, barnyard, dried grapefruit rind, and brett funk.  The level of acidity is on the higher end of the spectrum which is nice, because it counteracts the lack of carbonation and saves any sort of mouthfeel that is present.  Which by the way is DRY!  Big dry flavors of lemon juice, tart apple skin, hay, lemongrass, white grapes, and funk leads into a long tart finish.  Overall a wonderful wild.

Golden yellow with nice clarity. A one-finger head recedes and the beer is perfectly still, waiting.

Huge lemon-lime acidity. White vinegar. Some mushroom funkiness, hay, and light must.

Reminds me of a nice gueuze, though with an extra dose of citric acidity. A hint of oak lasts unattended for the first second, then a nice blend of lemon-juice acidity, green apple tang, and just a tiny bit of citrus (orange?) sweetness near the finish. Boundless cat pee. Very acidic, very tart, very vinegary  if B2 is every more acidic, Ill pass. Theres a discernible though almost overwhelmed oak tannic and mushroom earthiness throughout, most noticeable as a contrast to the sweeter notes. Mostly acidic though.

Medium, medium light and surprisingly slick, if not oily, the finish lingers on and on. Lower carbonation. When life gives you lemons 

One of the best wild ales out there, at least in my experience. The gueuze comparisons are inevitable, though this is less balanced and more overtly tart and less funky than befits that style. So clean and sharp, though not without its rawness. A treat, and one of the bars for the style.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"

The taste makes up for what is lacking in appearance and aroma. It is sweet to start then very tart, definetly a puckerer, the rest of the way but not so overwhelming you cant drink it.

The feel is tart and heavy and just coasts your tongue but crisp to drink and great drinkability for a sour beer.

Overall this wild ale is a good beer, partly just because I love sours. however, compared to other sours it is severly lacking in complexity and originality. Would I drink this beer again? Certainly. Would I go out of my to find it, trade something special to get it, or pay a lot at an auction site no.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

Notes from Batch 2
A-pours a bright golden yellow liquid that glows in the light with a creamy white head.

S-the nose is huge, tons of funk, lots of barnyard with notes of cheese.  there are earthy yeasts, a fair bit of sourness in the nose with light signs of acidity.  big fruits come in behind, tart lemons, sour peaches, juicy golden fruits.

T-this is very well integrated with great funk notes up front.  the earthy barnyard aromas carry right into the flavor, light flavors of cheese, hints of yeast.  juicy golden fruits are blended in with the funk with some tart lemon, light pear and peach flavors with a strong sourness to it.

M-the fel is livey and mouth puckering, medium to full body with a syrupy texture but soft and supple on the palate.  nice dry finish and still a persistent sour feel.

D-this is extremely well balanced with a great funk to it not seen in most american sours.  very gueuze like with plenty of fruit sweetness to add deep complexity and balance.

Batch 3-this is also very solid, would get a slightly lower rating.  it has the same complex funk to it that Batch 2 had.  It has slightly more acidity but still has the same assertive sourness. It also doesnt have the bright golden fruit presence that batch 2 has, it is there but not quite as vibrant.  Integrated well but slightly less complex.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"
1120,"2011-02-28",4.4,"Bottle, with huge thanks to oakbluff once again. Pours hazy gold, thin white head, spotty lacing. Nose is profoundly tart-smelling, with loads of sweat, acid, leather, lemon peel, brett. One of the finest aromas I have smelled on a beer to-date. Flavours are sweaty and very sour.

It had that typical horseblanket, citrus funk on the nose but there was an added level of complexity that I can only describe as a pleasant ""mustiness"". The flavors were the same and they were accompanied by an incredible, cheek puckering, sourness that I absolutely loved.

Strong, aggressive aroma of brett, barnyard, must and funk. Pure, unadulterated funk, as youd want in a wild ale.

1120,"2011-01-15",4.3,"750 ml Batch #2 bottle, courtesy cmillward. Thanks for cracking this open Chris! This pours a hazy, glowing golden orange color and crowned by a small off white head of foam that quickly recedes to a thin film leaving skinny rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is mouthwatering showing notes of sour lemon rinds, grapefruit, and orange followed by funky barnyard yeast, oak, and must. This smells as true to a Belgian gueuze lambic as you will find in the US. The flavor follows suit and is just as intensely sour as the nose lets on with the lemon, lime, and grapefruit dominating with the wild, musty yeast, and acetic acids coating the palate. The funky brettanomyces adds some nice dryness along with some earthy qualities. Clean oak and a hint of vanilla add beautiful balance to all the sourness. Medium bodied with perfect carbonation and nearly bone dry with a hint of sourness on the finish. This is great tasting beer that is completely refreshing.

Funky Brett aroma with hints of earthy oak, crisp light fruit, champagne yeast.

Medium bodied with a slightly puckering tart mouthfeel. Soft carbonation with some earthy oak notes as well as some puckering sour funk. The great thing about this beer is although it is sour and funky with dry bretty efervescence, it isnt acetic at all and is actually very well balanced by the citrus and light fruit notes.

Lovely sour lemon and brett aroma. The oak aging provides a distinct aroma that I have not smelled in a sour before. Both batches had a nice oaky, sour lemon, and brett bite to them.

1120,"2010-04-26",4.8,"Batch 003.

A- Body is a very cloudy (nearly opaque) hazy straw yellow. Pours with a hefty 2 finger+ foamy white head (it did gush some upon opening). Head retention is great...eventually fading to 1 finger and keeping that the rest of the way down.

S- The first thing that hits the nose is a big whiff of tart lemon. Lemon all over the place. Behind this is a very noticeable oak presence.

T- Much more wonderful and complex than the smell. Very tart and slightly sweet lemon zest is definitely the main character here. The acidic tartness puckers the lips slightly but a slight bready sweetness balances it out. The oak is definitely detectable but hides deep in the background and comes through a little more for the finish but never overshadows the main characters. What also comes forward for the finish is a saltiness. It finishes rather abruptly and is very dry-esp for a brew with a lower ABV.

M- Great medium to high carbonation and a light body with a balance of breadiness and citrus.

D- This was an excellent brew and one I would definitely trade for again. It ended a gathering with a few other BAs that turned out to be a Russian River night. These 3 beers (this deviation, and the younger) were definitely my favorite by this brewing co. so far and I look forward to trying other brews they have to offer.

T: The flavor picks up where the nose leaves off with a really intense lemon sourness. There are some flavors of green apple and white grape as the nose would indicate, but this bottle is not quite as puckering as others Ive had.

M: The lower level of carbonation provides a bit of a different mouthfeel and allows the acid to really come through. The finish is very sour and dry, as you would expect.

D: Ive always been a huge fan of the intense sourness that Beatification has, and this is no exception. I always enjoy the opportunity to open up a bottle.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

Appearance : Hazy golden with no head.

1120,"2010-02-06",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 26, 2010 750mL b3 courtesy of joeneugs. This beer froze in the mail, nearly exploded and now trying it, somehow it hasnt lost one bit of its spectacularity. The cork pops with good pressure, pours with good, spritzy carbonation leaving a small, white head that dissipates quickly. Looks cloudy, beautiful grapefruit juice in color like a top notch geuze. Aroma is similar to the best geuzes Ive tried: lemon sorbet, fresh grapefruit juice, grapefruit rind, white pepper. Taste is bright, fresh grapefruit and lemon with quenching tartness. Not very funky or horsey- more fresh citrus. Some oak, sour peaches, and Granny Smith apples shine through. The definite hit of our tasting. Thanks Joe!375mL b2 courtesy of MrChopin. Ive been debating about upping the score from 4.3 to 4.4 seeing that I dream of this beer on an almost constant basis. This, my third time trying the beer, has confirmed that it is time. Beatification b2 is so drying and so wildy complex with spicy cedar, drying oak, lemon/lime/orange, leather, peaches, apricots...it is an all encompassing sour experience that is never acedic, never citric. Just spot on perfection. My notes for this say, ""Its like the world ended and I was resurrected in paradise.""

Well, this is a purely subjective site, and given the price point of this beer, I think the voice of the opposition should be heard.  Many thanks to thedm and hotstuff for sharing this bottle, but damn it was awful.  Pale yellow in color with a thin nothing of a head.  An evil cloud of rotten hay, citrus compost and deer urine floated off the beer after I poured it.  This is a huge sour beer that physically caused me pain as my cheeks sucked into my head.

1120,"2009-12-06",4.5,"75cl bottle shared by photomike.   Just another animal entirely from the rest of the Russian River family.   The sourest beer that I have ever had, but somehow remained smooth and drinkable.   Im not even sure that I understand.   Ever since hearing Vinnie describe how they were brewing this beer while we were at the brewery for RBSG this past summer, Ive been dying to try it.   This truly is a Sonambic.   The funk, the acidity, the wood.   So intense from start to finish.   The pour is a relatively unassuming hazy yellow with a small fine head that leaves patchy lace behind.   The aroma is where things get interesting.   Its just the funkiest, sourest, most oaky thing to ever hit my nostrils.   Straight oaked lemon juice with brett.   The flavor is super dry, super sour, with yoghurt and lemons coming through, and quite oaky, though relatively clean tasting as well, without the the sharper cheesy funk flavors found in some Belgian lambics.   Light bodied with acid coasting the tongue.   I had burned my tongue the day before on some tea, and Beatification started to bring back the hurt with all that acid.   Pain for pleasure.   Honestly, this borders on too acidic, and I have a very high threshold for sour.   Though it is very well blended and smooth overall for how acidic it is.   This might not have been the most pleasurable beer of the tasting, but it was the most heavy of an impact.   Lacks the depth of Supplication, but the awesome sourness is unrivaled.   Killer shit.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"
1120,"2009-12-03",4.0,"Enjoyed a tasting of both batch 002 and 003 after a lovely Thanksgiving meal, thanks partly to the generosity of jrob21. Interesting and educational to taste two different batches.  Batch 2 was the better beer--sour and tart, but not over the top. Aroma of funk, citrus and related fruits, touch of peach.  Batch 2 was both wonderfully complex and delightfully balanced, with the harshest funky edges nicely mellowed.  Batch 3 was a little more wild, a little rougher around the edges--wondering if it will mature into a prime that can compete with 2.  Batch 3 had an underlying mustiness, almost dirt aftertaste that brought the beer down a notch in my book.  Still definitely worth having either batch.  Rating is for batch 2.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","AtlAggie"
1120,"2009-11-27",4.5,"Batch 2 and 3 paired together for a lovely thanksgiving treat that was truly educational and delicious. Batch 2 was far superior but I wonder if batch 3 wont be in another year or so. The sourness and fruit profile of 2 was far more developed. A work of art in my opinion. Big wild yeast aroma with some lightly toasted grain. Intense carbonation you can let sit and pop in your mouth. Lemon peel and juice citrus intensity with some apple working as well. Poured a light golden color that was slightly translucent. Batch 3 was not as intense sour wise or fruit wise and the density of the color was much more clear. Batch 2 gets a 4.5, batch 3 gets a 3.9 right now. Thats how big of a difference it is.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"

Has that round, eggy edge that some light Lost Abbey sours have.  Wow, extremely sour and puckering, maybe the most sour beer Ive had.  Very refined.  The sourness is centered on lemons and light citrus.  Candy-like at times.  Great for what it is, but perhaps the intense sourness kills some fruit complexity.  Russian River seems to be the king of sours in the USA.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

Bright, zingy tartness in the aroma.  Subdued brett fermentation notes along with a variety of other ""edgy"" fermentation characteristics including light lacto bacteria.  A bright, ripe, sweet-tart berry character also emerges with a soft, woody edge below it.  The flavor is very sour with a slight acetic quality supported by the influence of the barrel-aging.  Some spice and bitterness mingles with lemon pith is also present.  Clear, pure mouthfeel with waves of tartness that resonate across the palate and lift in the finish leaving  the physical sensation of the beer for minutes afterward.

Flavor is similar: white grapefruit, brett, vinegar, some slight sweetness (whats that doing here?) and more tartness.  Wine barrels (chardonnay/ Sav Blanc) used?  Very dry finish in the medium-bodied sour.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
1120,"2009-07-08",4.4,"Dunno how many bottles Ive drank of this.  Bottled I think in October of 2008, purchased from the brewery.  750mL bottle, Batch 3.  Clear yellow golden with a 1/2 finger white head, pretty good retention.  Big lemon pulp sourness up front with grapefruit rinds, leather, and funk behind.  There is also some dry wood.  Lots of sourness and acidity funk going on.  Flavor has some sour OJ right up front with lots of lacto behind.  Man, this is good.  Bone dry woody finish, sourness peaking around an 8 or so.  Very puckering.  Despite its acidity and sourness, it seems quite delicate.  I actually think this is underrated at a 4.0 average.  Light to medium body with moderate carbonation.  One of my favorite sours.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
1120,"2009-07-07",4.0,"Thanks to JVD for this 
A bottle of batch 2 pored into a challis produced a good finger worth of head that disappeared completely rather quickly. The body of the brew was a clear straw colored yellow.

The aroma reminded me of a gueuze in a lot of ways. The typical funk and sour citrus coming from the glass. The flavor was somewhat the same to me it remined me of a gueuze. I know Its a wild, but the sour citris and vinigar flavors were great. The mouthfeel was medium to light with almost no carbonation 

The bottle was quite enough for me but I will say I enjoyed every drop. I think the fact this is so hard to find will probably hinder me from looking forwad to driking this again . I was glad it reminded me of a gueuze so I can easly grab one to help remind me of the experiance

Its incredibly smooth and mellow for a beer that is also very sour. The Brett character is deliciously dirty and the citric complexity complements this.

Brett nose, lots of lemon and must, also more stinky feet than standard. Flavor surprisingly fruity, not quite as stinky as the nose, still very dusty and acidic, also somewhat bitter and woody. Finish is a little short but nice carbonation. As close to a lambic as Ive had in an American sour, not quite as complex or cohesive, and of the RR beers Ive had, probably the least distinguished from its competition, like its missing something from RR. Still, the sweet fruit in the nose and mouth help make it its own beer. 839417

10/2010 - b2 and b3, side by side. clear gold, bubbly with a thin, paper-white head. Heavy Brett in leather and a musky barn, also citrus, pale malt, and a strong salt presence. Flavor is very sour, puckering, lots of earthy hay and barn notes, very robust with strong malt and heavier, though spritzy, body than reg gueuze. b2 is a bit funkier, saltier, and with more acidity and barn character, the b3 being more light fruit.

The nose is really sour smelling, but also very clean and sharp.  Lots of lemon and grapefruit rinds with just a bit of stinky-feet like brett.  The vinegar note almost burns the nostrils a bit.  Very tart and sour at first, but the sharpness of the acidity recedes and lets the bretty funkiness emerge on the finish really well.  Tons and tons of that pixie stick like sugary tartness lingering well after swallowing.  This is exceedingly bright and citrusy up front, its a little surprising because alot of these ""Wild Ales"" tend to be a little softer and more muddled in the flavor, this is just sharp in every way.  Mouthfeel is dry and bitingly acidic at times just sucking the spit out of my cheeks.  Perfect bright lively carbonation keeps things dancing on the tongue.

1120,"2009-05-02",3.8,"375mL bottle, batch 2, poured into a tulip.

Pours an ever-so-slightly hazy golden orange with a creamy white head that settles in as a small cap fed by the bubbles continually streaming up from the bottom.  Lacing is good.

The aroma is a great mixture of tart and sweet fruits with a hint of funk.  The tartness comes from lemons up front before the sweetness of pears and maybe apples come in as well as a hint of light malts.  The funk is present but very, very faint.

The taste turns the tartness and funk up a notch over the aroma.  The initial blast on the tongue is a combination of tart lemons and vinegar acidity.  The sweet fruits are there but it takes the beer warming up a bit before I can pick out the sweeter aspects with pears again coming through.  The finish brings back the acidity and funk and leaves a puckering aftertaste.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of carbonation and extremely crisp, clean and dry in the finish.  Very white wine-like on the palate.

Bold, funky and heavily influenced by the more unique lambics. Pours at first a crystal clear pale gold, later a heavily murked milky golden, with a thin rim in white. Flavor is immediately reminiscent of gueze. Distinctive tartness runs on the side of lemon juice, other citric characters, and barnyardy goatness. Fresh. The barrel seems to lay back for me. Its more of an acid front, balanced with cotton and some of the base complexity. Grape skins and some old white grape juice come to mind. Delightful and complex overall.

The first sniff from the bottle is sour juiciness. The color is white-yellow with some sudsy bubbles. More sour juicy smell with a hint of musty funky acrid sweat. Dusty basement smells also. Brutal yet beautifully sour taste like lemonheads candy. Citrus lemon is mostly what I taste in addition to the sourness and some acidity. Overall, this is really awesome if you like sours. This also has more funkiness to it than the supplication I had a couple days ago. I thought the supplication was better.

really reminds me of gueuze, cheesy, funky aroma, puckering lemon juice sourness that contorts my face! Excellent beer and has aged well over the last year or so since release.

1120,"2009-01-18",4.2,"Id had this beer before, and enjoyed it immensely, at two different GABFs.  It was even better in the bottle - super sour, uncompromising, and delicious.  Very gueuze-like, which is not such a stretch once you read the description of this beer.

It poured a hazy straw color with an exuberant head which stuck around forever.  Aroma was very gueuze-like, and it was a touch champagne-like, but also rough, chalky, and very citrus-y.  Not understated like Cantillon - this stuff is assertive, very sour, not overly sweet (like Berlinerweisse) with a very rough and chalky mouthfeel.  If Cantillon was in Michigan rather than Brussels, then this is what gueuze would be known to taste like.  In addition to rough-ness, mouthfeel is also very carbonated.

Batch 002

Courtesy of errantnight, thanks Derek! Beatification pours a murky, pale straw yellow with a minimal head. The clean white head grew to a finger but fell rather quickly to a ring around the glass. Random carbonation bubbles rise here and there to the minimal head. I would have liked to see a better head on this beer. It’s almost nonexistent after it settles and swirls won’t even bring it forward.

The smell makes my mouth water immediately. A big hit of brett sourness right off the bat. Damp hay and earth are the first things I pick up, a bit of vinegar shows up half way through and becomes the dominant figure before being joined by a slight damp oakiness. Although the swirls don’t produce any head they do release enough carbonation to bring forward a peppery peachiness that only stays for a short time. Good depth with a great tart note.

Beatification will make you pucker. The puckering tartness hits immediately but calms down mid-palate. As this beer warms the flavors really start coming together nicely. The sourness shows signs of vinegar throughout but there’s a good deal of pepper and stone fruits. Not as much earthiness as the nose suggested but it is present. At first this was simply a decent beer, after more warming it becomes very tasty and much more flavor sneaks through the sourness.

The mouthfeel is a bit of a let down; I expected more carbonation and that light airy feel. The lack of carbonation leaves the mouthfeel a little heavier then expected. The body is medium and leaves a slight stick on the finish. Causes a nice pucker and makes my mouth water but I would like a bit more dryness. Just me being picky again I suppose.

Very easy drinking. The tartness leaves your mouth watering for another drink as soon as you swallow the last. It feels like I’ve been drinking this slowly but I look at my glass and it’s about gone.

A solid beer from Russian River. Not one of my favorites but all the flavor is there. Seems to me like a better carbonated brew would take care of most problems. I can’t wait to see what a couple years will do to these bottles

Looking at all three beers, this would be the one I would most want to drink. +1 over the other two.  Notes of moderate barnyard and musty esters, some vinegar acidity, berry and lemon, oak and hint of mineral water. The nose of this is milder than the other two but still is quite Lambic like in its nature.Much more acidic and aggressive than I would have expected, this has shockingly the most ""pucker power"" of all three in this tasting, some hints of grapefruit also noted. What it does not have is a much funk and barnyard character (oh it is still there). A bit medicinal and does display a light fresh oak finish.

Pours a golden/yellow body and no trace of head. Once the bottle is opened, an enticingly sour aroma wafts out and envelops the room. The mouthfeel is puckeringly sour with sour apples, citrus, and strong notes of vinegar. This is more sour than most gueuze I’ve tried. Medium carbonation and medium body. Enjoyable and incredibly intense. Five other people at the party could not handle the sourness, but SoLan and I were loving it.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","Floback"

Aroma was as expected funky/tart, brett coming through a lot, but it had it’s own sort of twist that is hard to put into words.  egajdzis passed on some of those Russian River oak chips that had been floating around home brew circles and I was getting a ton of the slurry that those chips created.

Aroma of barnyard funk, brett, with a little lemony citrus. The flavors are oustanding - the grapefruit is incredibly bold and up front. Very sour, but it comes across as predominately citric and lactic with minimal acetic qualities. More grape skins and peppery oak. Leathery brett comes through in the finish, as well as some sharp, aged cheese. The finish is extremely long and complex. Just gotta finish by saying WOW!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","hombrepalo"
1120,"2008-07-16",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 19, 2010 Rating #1100!  Enjoyed out on the boulevards.  Ive been holding onto this one for awhile.  Pours a cloudy mustard color yellow with a white head that lingers.  What a nose on this sour.  Sour sour. Oak, lemons, cherries are the first elements with earth and an almost wheaty funk coming through.  Within a short time this becomes rich and winey to balance out all of that sourness.  Green grapes, grape skins and a sugary sweetness.  The sourness on the tongue exceeds that of the nose and isnt quite as balanced in richness.  Crazy lactic acid, funky, oak, lemons, tart cherries, cherry pits, oranges, and grapes with an earthy herbal note.  The fruit, earthiness,  and oak together come off as leathery, which Id like to taste a little more above the sourness.  Finishes with a sour earthiness and slight funkiness.  This is almost a geuze, and almost too sour and lemony to reach the mind blowing territory that this yearns for.  None the less, an really damn good beer.

1120,"2008-07-12",3.9,"Appearance: Pours a clear, yellow body with, well, no head. 

Smell: A sour-scented aroma smelling of sour ole lemons, white grapes, and grandpa’s barnyard, all with a reasonably, understandably funky Brett component.

Taste: A sip of refreshing, oaky white wine and a bite of sharp cheese. Everpresent, underlying Bretty taste. Less a sour lemon taste and more of a taste of thick lemon rinds and a very puckering, almost grimacing wallop of acidity. Then a sip of a salty brine soak. Dry, sour finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. No real carbonation present.

Drinkability: Quite good, though I’d appreciate just a teensy bit of carbonation. I’d go so far as to say I’d cheerfully drink this each and every damn day. But sadly I don’t have easy access to Russian River beers.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

1120,"2008-07-10",4.4,"From a 375mL Bottle.  Mostly hazy, straw colored pour with a fleeting wisp of white head.  There was a 

faint crack upon un-corking, but the carbonation level is low and un-enthusiastic, even with a vigorous pour.  

I’ve opened a few of these now, and all seem to have the same carbonation issue; I’ve been storing them at room 

temperature in hopes that they would continue to bottle condition, but this seems to be all I’m going to get.  

Tart, musty aromas of chardonnay grape skins and oak.  Some sharper sour lemon rind notes come through, along 

with some softer apple and pear fruit characters.  Light bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel with a bold acidity.  The flavors are oustanding - the grapefruit is incredibly bold and up front.

Leathery brett comes through in the finish, as well as some sharp, aged cheese.  The finish is extremely long and complex, with a sourness depth that is rivaled by only the finest gueuze.

The head is small and quickly fleeting, leaving just a tiny, bubbly, pure white ring around the edge.  Minimal, sudsy spotting noted. The aroma comes as close to a true Belgian gueuze lambic as anything Ive ever encountered here in the U.S.  Sour notes of lemon, grapefruit, and tangelo hit first, followed immediately by funky barnyard notes, dust, and oak.  Flavors are mouth puckering and downright sour, perhaps the most sour of Vinnies creations that Ive tasted to date.

hazy golden straw color with a small white head which fades quickly to nothing. immediately smells very dry and tart... dusty, yeast, black pepper numbing, some savory woodiness and country time lemonade mix? i assume this to be lemon/grapefruit  pith and some mineral-y notes. there is little to no malt sweetness on the palate... mmm.

Pours a mellow gold with a very modest head. Stunningly good aroma: not much of the sourness comes through, but instead I get the cobwebbiest aroma Ive ever enjoyed, brett funk, rich yeastiness, mild oak. The flavor initially hits surprisingly sour, given that there was so little of the balsamic sourness on the nose. But instead its a powerful bretty sourness, thick and almost chalky, gentle barrel character, lemon juice and other citrus. 

This is a really great beer.

Revisit December 2014 Fresh vs. Aged. A fresh bottle--well, relatively fresh--bottled 9/13, up against an old batch 002 from 2008 or earlier. The new one porous perfectly clear bright yellow with short-lived white head, wine and oak on the nose, no cobwebs. The old one is a murky cloudy yellow-brown, no head and nary a puff when I open the bottle. This one has an aggressive old lambic nose, tons of rubber, some cheese, again those cobwebs. But its absolutely delicious thats rich and intense the way that only older lambics can be. All sugars are gone, its just lemon acidity and rich complex funk. It is so good that by comparison the younger one seems single dimensional, which is impressive because the younger beer--though sweet-tart by comparison--is very good in its own right. These both remain challenge beers, not easy drinking, what for their intense tartness. Its hard to believe that the old one is an American beer at all so much does it taste like a Belgian gueuze. The young one, much more American. I dont know how much is a change in batch and how much the aging, but the lack of cobwebs in the younger is probably batch where the drier flavors of the older is probably age. The old one would be a 4.2 or 4.3, the younger 3.9 or 4.0. Ill let the current rating stand but this one could easily edge upward if one were willing to cellar.

1120,"2008-05-20",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 2, 2009 My Bottom Line:
Whtie wine fruitiness and citrusy dignity levitate from a puckering sour flavor and finish, before dryness steals the beer and hides it in your gums. This wonderfully idiosyncratic Sour Ale feels like its at the intersection of Lambic, Champagne, and Beer.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A wispy head of foam slowly dissolves into the hazy pale straw blond.
-The prickly champagne-like carbonation increases drinkability.
-The sourness is rather intense, and thus recalls some of the best lambic out there. I dont think there is anything closer to Cantillon Gueuze in America than this.
-The wilderness within is almost as gripping as the fruity tartness. I get the impression this is going to become even more amazing a year or so down the road.

Some swirls rotate in the middle and the thinnest rim of bubbles circle the glass but the apparent carbonation on this is very low.  Aroma intensely funky and sour smelling, certainly more than its two brothers.  Were getting into Gueuze territory here.  Barnyard is heavy, something that was relatively light or non-existant in the Supplication and Temptation.  Huge brett presence, hay, horse, more barnyard funk, dog, creek (not kriek, creek, like rivers and mud and stuff)  Very powerful smell.  Lemons and other acidic fruits also make an appearance.  I can tell this thing is going to be sour just from the smell.  Taste is highly acidic and tart which fades into a lemony flavor which is even sourer then a dry finish.  This thing is like a lemonhead.  This is very, very lambic like.  I certainly would have guessed this is some type of Gueuze or unblended lambic had I not known what I was drinking.  While it is exciting drinking a 100% spontaneously fermented beverage from the US, and while this certainly holds up to its Belgian counterparts, and while it is delicous and awesome on its own, I think this is not on the same level of Temptation or Supplication.

1120,"2008-05-10",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 11, 2008 Poured from a 375 ml bottle.  First pour.  Misty gold.  Dandelion hue.  Funky nose full of minerals, musty cheeses, horse hints and searing pineapple and fresh cherry brett.  Fruit qualities lay back.  Rich vanilla oak.  Seems lightly milky and even floral at times.  Tinny fruit and funky sweat flavor.  White pepper, irish cheddar, pineapple, white grapes.  Almost a salty degree of earthy tanginess, like saltwater on a wet dog.  Minerals ring a little harshly and lend heavy strength to a kind of clangy sweetness that tugs against the tartness.  Full funk.  Lots of back and forth between pulsating acidity and cave like dryness in the finish.


Yeast thickens it up.  Pillowy, hawaiian bread sweetness develops in the nose.  Seems more delicate and more frontal.  Funkiness less hollowed out and more settled.  Brusque tone of white pepper on the cheesiness.  Very dry flavor with a subdued, feathery fruit texture enfolding the bacterial circus.  Infection really holds court here, really pressing the acids and rancid meats.  Grapefruit and pineapple acid.  Palate is pleasantly milky and soft, seeming to downplay the acidity that seems so recurrent throughout.  Bit of a mango presence or some type of very high acid tropical fruit.  Softens up pleasantly in a silky chardonnay like finish.  

 
Leaves me wanting more.  Seems to really find its center of finesse and funk somewhere toward the end, after plenty of breath, at which point the one third sample from this bottle is simply not enough, even on this night when my stomach seems opposed to the sours.  Thanks for sharing, Tyler!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
1120,"2008-05-10",4.4,"aroma is primarily funk, a little faint but pouring some of the yeast seems to awaken the funk. The flavour is immensly sour but in a really great way, grapefruit with lingering citric sour. Adding yeast muddles the flavour a bit and gives my mouth a thick coating
of lactic sourness, I liken it to the feeling you get after throwing up but dont mean it in a bad.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"
1120,"2008-05-10",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 12, 2008 Bottle. Initial review of the top half of the bottle before the yeast pours.

Holy shit! What a insanely funky and over the top nose! Tart, juicy citrus, white pepper, wood, brett, horse blanket, cow poop, farm. Absolutely wonderful in its complexity. Pours a clear gold. Nearly still. Nearly perfect. Shimmering in all its awesomeness. Flavor is tart and acidic beyond belief. Pineapple, brett, sour, funky. Awesome!
After the yeast. More musty notes emerge. More basement and less farm. Pungent and potent as all hell. White pepper notes emerge. Grapefruit skin. White grape skin and tannin.

1120,"2008-05-03",4.4,"Bottle generously shared by mreusch. This looks just like grapefruit juice (minus the pulp) with a tiny skin of white bubbles that disappear to a flat surface. The nose is bretty and nicely funky with a solid, tart grapefruit backbone. Medium-bodied and tart with a nice, sour and lightly dry finish. Big, tart and citric, the initial hit is amazing and the sourness lingers before transitioning to a sweet residual note in the aftertaste. This may not be the most complex sour that Ive tried, but it is nothing short of delicious. When this amazing brew first hit my tongue, I immediately thought of a quote Id heard on The Simpsons. ""Its like theres a party in my mouth, and everyones invited."" Thanks a ton for sharing this with me, Matt!","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"
1120,"2008-05-03",4.0,"I searched my whole house for my notes on this, so Im doing it from memory.  I bought a bottle from the brewery (via Tim).  I opened it at the bottle shop with Sean with Supplication.  I like Supplication better.  Ive heard this beer is very sour, but I find it to be medium sourness, like most gueuzes.  In fact I would call it an above average gueuze.  I dont it is as good as my memory of Batch 001.  I have all 3 bottles, so Ill have to do a tasting sometime.  Aroma of some hay and baryard funk.  Pretty nice.  Dryish.  Like others have mentioned, I would like to try this one aged.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"
1120,"2008-05-02",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 26, 2012 375ml bottle pours clear yellow when its done carefully, but you have to mix the yeast in this one, so my glass ends up cloudy soft, very appealing.  When really cold the aroma has some eggs/sulfur/mustard in it, but at proper temperature it disappears, and what you have is a musty barnyard and compost scented wheat, rye, cereal grain and funky, sharp, acidic lactic acid.  Taste is very bright and bitter - much like lemon juice, amazingly bitter and sharp on the tongue, developing a soft wheat smoothness over the middle, but entirely consumed in a lactic acidity.  Fruity but sour lemon zest and smooth, soothing wheat are the primary flavors, and the finish is a mix of throat-burning acid and soothing sweet lemon. Really good, but I dont think its fully developed yet.  Will revisit in one year.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1120,"2008-05-02",4.1,"Batch 002; Sampled May 2008
A light carbonation coupled with a soft pour produces only a half covering of frothy, wispy white froth.  The beer is a hazy, yellow-gold color and the aroma is quite divine.  Nicely tart with notes of grapefruit, lightly spicy oak, musty toe-cheese, light urea, light cedar, celery seed, light nail-polish-remover, a woody mushroom note and a slight, savory, cooked vegetable note that is actually quite nice.  While the nose does have a dominant tartness to it up front, the backdrop is what makes this so interesting; a solid base of funk has been layered in to this beer in a very subtle manner.

Very sour tasting, even more than the aroma would have suggested.  The carbonation is somewhat soft (especially if one is expecting Gueuze levels of CO2), but it does provide a nice tickle of texture to this beer.  Puckeringly sour with a mix of lemon and sour-grapefruit flavors, yet still eminently drinkable for this lover of sour beers.  This beer is almost devoid of malt sweetness and thus is fairly light bodied.  There is some texture to this beer though, it has a light velvet-like touch that seems to stem from some tannic presence that is especially noticeable in the finish as it clings to the roof of my mouth.  Really this has a perfect texture to it, quite light and quaffable yet with some structure an palate presence such that it is nothing like watery.  This is actually fairly clean tasting, the funk notes of the nose seem to not have really translated to the flavor, other than a sort of oral-nasal interaction during each sip.  The finish does have some interesting things going on, in addition to some light tannic oak, there is a soft, almost savory thing going on, that I cant quite pin down flavor wise.  Also there is a nice, supporting Brettanomyces funkiness here that provides some musty, moldy horse-blanket notes.

A 375ml bottle of this is not nearly enough, this is so drinkable that I find my self drinking from my glass quite frequently, enjoying the tart funkiness that is this beer.  I really should have put two bottles of this brew in the fridge, this just disappeared too quickly and leaves me wanting at least another glass.  It is not the most complex of beers (in fact the batch 001s where both more complex), but it is so drinkable, so well balanced, and such a pleasure to drink.  I cant wait to see how this & further batches evolve.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
1120,"2008-05-01",4.5,"This sour ale pours a slightly murky orange gold color from a 375ml bottle. Small sized white foamy head, with decent lacing. The aroma is funky, tart, yeasty, yet there is some fruitiness in there. A medium bodied sour ale. WOW. Its tart and sour and funky and then tart and acidic and funky some more. There is a lot going on here, the tartness sort of drowns everything out, but there is a nice funk and some yeast and fruit going on in the background. As with Batch 01 this beer is almost Berliner Weiss in its tartness. It will be interesting to see how this one ages. It has that Cantillon like quality to it. Very nice. Wish I still had some 01 to match it against. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is crisp and bond dry. Aftertaste is tart and sour.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

1120,"2008-04-22",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 1, 2008 Darkish yellow. Vigorous pour raises merely a thin cap of head which fully retains its tightly packed ring. Boisterous lemon, peach, melon, pencil eraser, musty cedar, horseblanket, and pineapple aromas. Relaxed, fluffy carbonation. Slippery body. Soft yet forceful iron- and lemon-tinged acidity is quick to buckle the cheeks as lustrous yet brilliantly composed oak gently grips the tongue before depositing a body-enhancing texture of creaminess. Remarkably radiant from the get-go. Soft, cleanly defined straw-tinged malt generates delicate sweetness as well as a touch of body while enhancing the acid which steadily, yet ever so lightly, tightens its clasp. Coarse acids stimulate the appetite and scrub the throat while sliding down the gullet. Body beautifully teeters on the verge of dryness, as its brisk and somewhat chalky, yet equally dense in its succulence and bright explosiveness. Impeccable cleanness of the beer enables background notes of sherbet, peach and fresh lime and lemon juice to exude vividly. Finishes artfully balanced with spicy brett, juicy flashes of fruitiness and clingy saliva-inducing acids swirled with lingering inklings of pineapple, lemon, dusty oak and bitter peach skin.

Aroma is very earthy with notes of wild yeast, cellar funk, wet grass, saddle leather, muscat grapes and lighter oak tones. I was surprised at how the barrel influence was subdued more so than Batch 001. Puckering, powerful sourness on the front of each sip, with lemon citrus and a hearty bready / biscuity finish. Yeasty and dry palate, modest carbonation. The oak is more noticeable at the end of the flavor fade. Seems like it needs time to mellow in the bottle.

First sip aaaand... WOW that is sour. My eye literally twitched after swallowing. The sourness tastes like grapefruit rind soaked in lemon juice. Easily sourer than any gueuze Ive had. Also a lot of wood here for added complexity. Wood and rind linger on the palate and lips for what seems like hours.

The head drops very quickly, however the aroma is still quite pungent.  Sour & tart fills the palate finishes wonderfully dry. As the beer warms the tart really becomes evident.  Of all the RRBC sour ales this one carries with it the most ""cantillion"" brettanomyces character of all of them.
