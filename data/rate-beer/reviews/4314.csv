4314,"2017-06-02",4.0,"Deep dark brown coloured body with a nice, albeit slightly thin tan head, very opaque, around 80% with a velvety violet glow. Aroma of toasted malt, oatmeal, pit fruits, earth, caramel, figs and bunches of cherries. Full-bodied; Super pungent malt kick with a lot of earth, some figs and hay and a dose of yeast all noticeable at first. Some alcohol, even more earth, a dry oaky characteristic and some pit fruits and figs finish everything out with a very nice roasty sweetness at the end along with a warmth from all the alcohol. Overall, a nice and pungent beer with a lot of flavours, a smooth complexity with a nice sweet finish and a lot of alcohol and booze too, but relatively well masked. Nice to sample, especially on draught and fresh! Im thinking this would age well, and if I find a bottle, ill try! I sampled this SIXTEEN ounce pour on draught for US$7,00 from Whole Foods in Pentagon City (Arlington), Virginia on 24-May-2017 sampled at the end of my driveway!","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
4314,"2017-05-21",3.4,"On the strength of the ratings (and decent price), I bought a bottle yesterday for my neighborhood card party, and my three friends really enjoyed this, but I didnt think it particularly impressive. Not quite an ""English strong ale"" vibe, though the caramel maltiness was obvious; it still felt very American. Dark amber with a hint of red in the light. Silky, oily texture. Muted alcohol. Totally fine, but I didnt get the kinds of depth from it that I wanted. Bottle.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

Sweet dark fruits. A bit leathery. Wet wood. Some boozy notes. Big body and moderate carbonation. I could see this beer doing well with age.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
4314,"2016-07-07",3.4,"Sampled on draft at 3R6P this beer poured an exceptionally dark brown color with a small foamy beige head that left decent lacing. The aroma was sweet and malty with notes of raisin, cherry and brandy. The flavor was very boozy with raisin, fig, brandy, molasses and toasted caramel. Long finish with lingering and growing booziness. Moderately full bodied but a bit flat. Interesting.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"
4314,"2016-07-02",3.3,"Smells like an ale...the best way to put it. Off plum color, the taste is honey, floral, malty, you sure can taste that 11% ABV. Nothing special about the taste, sweet and boozy. Not what I was hoping for from one of my favorite brewers, was hoping for something with a little heat to it...some kind of twist to a classic english ale.","long beach, California, USA","Mrnoluv"
4314,"2016-06-28",4.0,"It pours dark amber with a light brown moderate head and it also has legs. There are high fruit aromas from cherries and dried fruits. There are also aromas of alcohol, sherry, and toffee. There are flavors that are malty sweet They feature molasses and toffee. In addition alcohol, sherry, dried fruit and toffee are part of the array of flavors. It is full bodied and chewy with plenty of alcohol warming. It has a low-moderate carbonation. Overall, it is a complex malty blend with significant alcohol but not to the point of being hot.","Pinehurst, North Carolina, USA","hman43"
4314,"2016-06-19",3.1,"Draft taster at AleSmith into miniglobe. Clear red color with healthy yellow foam. Mega Banana ester nose is bananas fosters dessert, brown sugar, fermenting fruit, deep cherry. Flavor is super medicinal like cough syrup, bitterness is sharper than expected and not well integrated. Body is heavy but it comes across as two beers at once, Old Ale/Barleywine and Imperial Red. Maybe given enough time, the hop content will mellow out and the esters and medicinal character will dissipate. It is meant to be aged, so perhaps a fresh sample isnt a great indicator of what it is meant to become.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
4314,"2016-06-06",3.7,"Really excited to find this on draft at the Daily Pint Santa Monica. Dark chestnut color with ruby highlights and a small tan head with thick lacing. The aroma is molasses and a hint of chocolate. Bold flavor with dark malt, maple syrup, and coffee but finishes with an almost tart fruitiness. Really cool and well hidden ABV.

4314,"2016-06-05",3.9,"Similar enough to their olde ale to wonder why theyd make both. A touch lighter in color, but just a touch. Body is the same. Also a high octane malt driven brew with toast and dark fruit, leather and toffee and spice. Good stuff, but not quite their best and an expensive 750.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
4314,"2016-06-04",3.9,"Pours a deep brown, with middling head. Aromas of toffee, dark fruit, caramel, licorice. Flavors include licorice, dark fruit (i.e., plum, prune, etc.), some leather, caramel, coffee, a touch of chocolate. Fairly boozy beer (i.e., alcohol content not well-hidden). A touch too cloying in its overall sweetness. A beer to sip/savor.","Osseo, Minnesota, USA","bookman10"

4314,"2016-05-06",3.5,"Bottle from The Best Damn Beer Shop in San Diego (and it sort of is). Dark clear chestnut color with a small off white head. Big caramel and toffee aroma, dates, sugar plums, brown sugar. The flavor is very sweet and toffee-ish, lots of overripe candied fruits. Full and thick, syrupy. Good but gets to be a chore to drink.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
