966,"2015-09-04",4.0,"Sampled June 2014
A steady pour into my teku glass produces a three finger thick, pale tan colored head. The beer is a bright amber color that shows a golden-amber hue when held up to the light. As I pour this I can smell fruity, tropical hop notes mixed with phenolic, funky Brettanomyces notes. Peaches, kumquat zest and guava all play a prominent role up front, while funky fermentation notes contribute light touches of muskiness, mustiness, and curing plastic aromatics. 

The beer is quite light bodied and effervescent, and is eminently quaffable. The dominant character is the hops and it is quite distinct with ample notes of papaya, guava, concentrated peach nectar, tropical kumquat, and just a big, floral, tropical flower nectar like character that is almost more aromatic in the flavor than actual flavor. The beer is quite dry, yet still manages to have that hugely expressive fruit hop character. It does have a lightly biting bitterness, but this is actually fairly soft compared to how expressive the hop notes are. The Brett character contributes flavors of musty, barely musky, and slightly phenolic plastic character.

This is a really nice beer, it drinks too fast for a beer of this strength. I really like the New World hop character that is so expressive in this beer. This is likely a funky leaning, amply hopped, Saisonesque beer, that is really hitting the spot for me right now.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

966,"2015-05-30",3.9,"Bottle (750 ml) bought @ Craft Beer Cellar Waterbury. Gusher. Split with the Québec crew.

Appearance: I had the first pour out of the bottle and it was slightly hazy bright golden with a small white head, low retention and little lacing. The later pours were dirtier. 

Aroma: Herbal and leathery brettanomyces forward along peppery notes, Belgian yeast, mild to moderate frutiness and earthy notes. 

Taste: Herbals, leathery brettanomyces, yeasty presence, peppery notes, earthy notes, mild fruitiness, light resinous notes and mild bitterness. 

Palate: Medium body. Medium carbonation. Ample mouthfeel. Dry and herbal finish. 

Overall: Very tasty and easy drinking brett Belgian Ale. Theres definitely some strong similarities with Orval (and they even state it in the description of the beer), but this one feels a bit heavier despite having the same abv and doesnt have the same depth either. Dont get me wrong, this is a really nice and complex beer but considering the original is still quite a lot better than the ""copy"" and that I can get 4 x more quantity of Orval for the same price tag, the choice is easy.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

OCZY : piwo jest mętne o kolorze pomarańczowym z zółtymi prześwitami. Piana piwa jest spora i biała. 

NOS : aromat piwa wskazuje na nuty podobne do lambika : tarta, zielone jabłko, rabarbar, skórka cytryny, drewno, gotowana wiśnia, rabarbar i ocet winny. Ogólnie bardzo świeże w zapachu. Można wyczuć również czerstwy chleb, słodkie nuty przypominające coś między cukrem, karmelem i miodem. Do tego grejpfrut i obora. 

USTA : mocno gazowane o puszystej konsystencji podobnej do mleka. 
Piwo jest wielowymiarowe. Nie jest tak kwaśne jak zapowiadało się po aromacie. Tak na prawdę to jest świetnie wyważone i dzika kwaśność nie zdominowała tego piwa ale nadała mu kolejny wymiar. Piwo jest wytrawne i trzeba przyznać, przypomina Orvala. Nuty słodowe przypominają czerstwy chleb i słodką tarte z niuansami pestek dyni i słonecznika. Do tego cierpkie orzechy włoskie, surowy rabarbar. Przebija się również słodycz w postaci oranżady. Jest to wyczuwalne aż do końca. Gorzkość jest średnia i bardzo cytrusowa podobna do skórki pompelo i pestek mandarynki. Trzeba dodać również wyczuwalne nowe nuty cierpkie podobne do drewna. Posmak tego piwa jest przyjemny i przypomina kompot z rabarbaru, oranżadę, drewno, skórkę cytrusowa i goździki. 

ODCZUCIA : nieźle. Skurczybyki zrobili piwo prawie że idealnie pod mój gust. Przy okazji bardzo złożone i ORZEŹWIAJĄCE! Trudno o tak dobry miks. Polecam.

966,"2014-08-18",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
Citrus fruit, flowers and straw whirl about this Wild Ales elegant mouthfeel, creating quite an impression on the finishing bitter resins.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the cloudy beige.
-Carbonation is appropriately spritzy.
-This is as complex as it is drinkable.
-This is an obvious cousin of Orval.
