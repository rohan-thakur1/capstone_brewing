1417,"2017-02-16",4.1,"Super-malty, dark amber in color, a few notches above classic VT altbier by Long Trail Brewing. As flavorful as a nice Scottish ale, I need to eat a hearty meal while polishing a bomber off next time. Another nice job by Harpoon.","Miltonboro, Vermont, USA","vodka4blood"

1417,"2016-12-26",4.4,"Amazingly attractive brew - shimmering deep walnut color. Sweet malty nose and body. Notes of caramel, toasted grains, and a light peppery end. Great balance - smooth and full. Great job! After having Sticke Alt in Duesseldorf and area, this comes about as close as you can get to the original style.","GERMANY","pivo"
1417,"2016-11-24",3.7,"Ruby brown pour with aroma of bread, toffee, and some dark fruit. Flavorful with dark fruit and toffee sweetness with some bread and a subtle hop presence. Very nice.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","alobar"
1417,"2016-11-24",3.6,"Thanks to Jason for snagging this bottle for me! Best by date smeared so not sure but I think its September 2017. Pours a clear orange brown with a large tan head. I lived in Düsseldorf for 4 years and so far it looks the part.

The smell is roasted grain, some spicy hops and rich malt sweetness. The taste is toasty, rich and somewhat sweet up front with licorice ending with the spicy hops. Ive had plenty of Sticke and while this doesnt hang with the best it fits into the mix. Well done.

Body is medium with fine carbonation as it should be.","Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, ENGLAND","ThirstyBird"
1417,"2016-11-02",4.1,"Pours amber with thin tan cap. Aroma is caramel and lightly toasted malts. Flavor is similar with a really nice balance of caramel sweet offset by just the right amount of hop to finish clean. Very tasty, very smooth. Ill need to find this again.","New Hampshire, USA","tekstr1der"

1417,"2016-10-18",3.5,"Bomber with a low fill line, ENJOY BY 09/15/16 -- funny thats just recently been put out on shelves in this market, maybe they meant it as a born on date? Nose of skinny milk chocolate and cola, some toasty-roasty bock notes that threatened to be overdone soup. Pour dark copper darkening to rich mahogany in the glass, really pretty, with a large and sudsy yellow-tinted tan head. Taste light-medium bitter and near-cloying with intense, sweet caramel/toffee. Earth, wood, chocolate, cocoa, and some red berry and plum drifting through the background. Mouthfeel is pretty good, somewhere between light and medium but malty, only nick is a little undercarbonated. Some nice noble citrus from the hops as a rounding note, touches of cereal grain and dark bread crusts. Might be too fruity for me but thats certainly common of Altbiere on one side of that continuum, and the booze is quite subtle and complementary. Id say kick up the gas while toning down the caramel bomb and theres a winner here. [2016.10.18: 3.5]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
1417,"2016-10-06",3.9,"22 ounce bottle. Pours a chestnut brown color with a moderate sized rocky beige head. Nose has hints of baked bread and caramel. First sip brings a rich toasted maltiness that exudes caramel and nuts. Their is an underlying spicy hop character throughout that offers a nice balance to the rich maltiness. Overall, a nice interpretation of the classic German Alt style.","Hamilton Square, New Jersey, USA","gripweed57"

1417,"2016-09-29",3.4,"650 ml Bottle from Greg & Janes beer and Wine. With an unclear best by date on label. Clear mahogany color, light head nd retention. Aroma is earthy malt, house lager yeast, caramel, and maybe some fresh soil from that earthy tone. 

The flavor is about what you would expect from the style. Caramel and smashed nuts upfront with a mild lager yeast with a light fruit hint in the finish. Pretty simple style but this is brewed with no flaws. Exactly as it should be.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

Low hop profile. The body is medium. The taste has this overwhelming tobacco element to it and maybe a little cherry like fruitiness.

1417,"2016-07-07",2.7,"Draught at Bank of America Pavilion or whatever tf its called now, 6/24/16.Dark amber-mahogany body is highly carbonated and shows good clarity with a light tan head atop that is moderately well-retained.Some light herbs and grass in the background show just a smattering of hops as nutty, toffee and caramel-laden malts provide the dominant theme. Unfortunately, a shockingly high amount of banana ester and alcohol are also very present.Sweet, not horrendously so, at least, with a sticky-malty texture, tons of rather fizzy carbonation and a sharp, alcohol and ester-ridden finish. The caramel/toffee malts are at least modestly well-attenuated, if somewhat sluggish and heavily bready at times. Not too much complexity. Difficult to drink much as the ""house character"" sharpness and heavy grassiness makes it rather a chore to do so, as is it with most of their beers.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
