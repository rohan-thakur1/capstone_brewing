4246,"2016-10-09",3.5,"Tiny pour, on tap at Autumn Brew Review in Nordeast Minneapolis, Minnesota. Consumed on 9-17-16. 2016 edition. Bright, reddish copper with pink/beige head. Clear and shiny liquid. Looks very good. Cherry pie filling scent. Mineral aroma. Tart cherry pie filling flavor. Nice but subtler taste than I prefer. Light body. Lively and frothy in the palate. Good but nothing special, unfortunately.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
4246,"2014-09-20",4.0,"The aroma has both malt and cherry. The taste is perfectly tart and sour. The palate is somewhat strong bodied. Overall, a great beer. It be awesome if Fitgers would brew this as a regular beer.","Valley City, North Dakota, USA","benfergy"
4246,"2014-05-18",3.5,"Bottle... Clear dirty-orange pour with a small, fizzy, white head. Decent retention. The aroma is tough to pull, but I am finally rewarded by nice components of cherry and oak. Medium to full-bodied with fizzy carbonation. Both the flavor and finish are crisp, fruity and tangy. Bottle courtesy of biggsbowler!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
4246,"2014-01-03",3.4,"Bottled sample. Pale pink in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas are of sweet cherry candy and sugar cookies. Delicate floral cherry, vanilla, and grainy malts on the palate. Light bodied. Tasty enough, but whenever I have a beer like this I always wish I was drinking kriek instead.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
4246,"2013-11-10",3.3,"Pour on tap, dark reddish pour with thin off white head, aroma brought notes of big sugary cherry, cherry jam, hints of spicy cinnamon, slight booze notes, touch of slight vanilla in there as well, a bit too sweet. Taste is similar, touch of sweet sugary cherry, slight earth, bready notes, slight caramel, toffee, lots of vanilla, cinnamon, some other earthy spices, finishing slightly boozy, sweet.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"

4246,"2012-10-15",4.3,"GABF 2012. Multiple tastes. Pours a cloudy reddish appearance with a tan head. Tons of pie cherries in the nose with a light herbal and woody elements. Juicy pie cherry, fairly tart, a bit juicy flavor. A nice alternative to New Glarus Belgian Red. Great stuff!","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"

4246,"2012-10-13",4.2,"Sampled on 10/11/2012 at GABF. This fruity beer pours a medium to light amber gold color. Small to medium sized white foamy head. The aroma is fruity and sweet, tart cherries. A medium bodied fruity beer. The malts are fruity and sweet. The hops are earthy. Nice tart cherry flavors. Decent carbonation. Like the balance between the malts and the fruit. Very clean. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly tart.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
4246,"2012-09-16",3.6,"Had this at the 2012 Autumn Brew Review. Had a very big cherry taste with a nice tartness.","Farmington, Minnesota, USA","XmnwildX12"
4246,"2010-10-03",3.8,"Draft at Autumn Brew Review. Wow, pours a bright, clear maraschino cherry red color with a white wispy head. Very sweet chery pie filling like aroma and nothing else coming from this. Medium mouthfeel. The taste is like drinking liquid pie filling! Good, but pretty sweet overall. Not tart at all. As a fruit beer I think this is very successful but again the sweetness could be dialed down just a touch.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"

4246,"2008-10-04",4.0,"Autumn Brew Review 2008 
This is about as close as Ive tried to the New Glarus Belgian Red.  Slightly more tart, almost like a lambic, but the flavor was pretty exquisite.  Cherry pie in a beer.  Im normally not a huge fan of fruit beers, but this one was pretty damn good!  My wife loved this and was disappointed when they ran out.  They gave her the Cherry Stout instead and she was disappointed, as this beer was a special release around 3 PM in the afternoon.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
4246,"2008-09-30",4.2,"Autumn Brew Review 2008; 2008 Vintage.  What a fantastic surprise on the pouring list!  Dark pink color with no head.  Strong, sweet cherry aroma.  Man... it tastes like a cherry smoothie.  Light malt background taste.  The earthiness and nutiness of cherry pits stands out.  Delicious.  The only cherry beer that could run alongside New Glarus Belgian Red.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"

4246,"2007-10-08",4.1,"Draft ABR 07.  Poured a dark ruby red.  Nice earthy sweet and tart nose.  Not possible you say well it is.  Very nice flavor that exudes the earthy side of sweet cherries as well as a hint of brown sugar and tart cherry.","Farewell Minny; Hello Puyallup, Washington, USA","joebrew"
4246,"2007-10-06",3.9,"Sampled on draught at the ABR 07 in Minneapolis, MN. Pours a clear reddish amber brew with a light pink head that has good retention and lacing. Aroma of light bready malt with an abundance of Wilderness cherry pie filling scent. (Woo Hoo!) Taste is medium bodied, very light carbonation with a light bready and tart cherry flavor. Finish has a good balance of cherry tartness and hoppy bitterness that made this a very memorable beverage.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
4246,"2007-10-02",4.0,"2007 ABR.  Really good cherry beer.  Great cherry aroma and great cherry flavor.  Pink color.  A little sweet, some wheat flavor but mostly cherry with just a little sourness.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"

4246,"2007-10-01",3.7,"Draft at ABR under the name Cherry Batch 2200. Pretty, bright, tart, starburst cherry aroma. Poured a Bright pink wiht some brownish/amber highlights. Fairly dry and tart on the palate. Very crisp and refreshing. Just a hint of sourness on the finish. Crisp and lively with excellent carbonation.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
4246,"2007-09-23",3.2,"Draft at the Brewhouse.  Im going to classify the ""Cherry Batch 2200"" that I tried over the weekend under this label.  I loved the novelty of it; the color was a perfect cherry red and the aroma was pitch-perfect: sour cherries.  However, the predominant flavor of the beer was to similar to Robitussin or Vicks 44.  I havent had real Kriek yet but I assume its a little better than this.","Edina, Minnesota, USA","thomasacross"
4246,"2007-01-22",4.1,"It poured a cloudy, murky, pinkish tan, not an attractive color by any means, with about half an inch of pinkish white head. The appearance score is helped out by the excellent lacing it left behind. Prominent cherry in the aroma.

The taste is all cherry - both tart and sweet. Although I couldnt taste any underlying beer flavor, it certainly didnt taste like wine, mead, or cider. It was similar to New Glarus cherry ale, but a little less cherry (not much) and a little more tart. Very delicious in any event. Medium to full in body, carbonation is a little on the light side, but still solid.","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"
4246,"2005-10-10",3.5,"Tap,ABR.One of the delights at the ABR.Cloudy pink with a sour cherry nose.I was thinking this woilg be ""Lambic"" sour but it has a nice balance of sweet and sour. A little acidic buy tasty overall.","Western Minneapolis Suburbs, Minnesota, USA","footbalm"
4246,"2005-09-26",3.7,"A Vibrant Milky Red Glow Coloring with White Ring.  Light Sweet/Tart Cherry and Wheat Aroma. Big Cherry Hit...Very Tart but Still Sweet...Medium Mouthfeel and Elusive Dry Wheat Aftertaste.  Very Fruity - Tart-Heavy Brew.","Minnesota, USA","robertsreality"
4246,"2005-09-17",3.9,"Super murky ruby pour, tinged brownish. Beautiful top of rose colored head. Lucious black cherry aroma. Super tart cherry flavor. Right up there with New Glarus Belgian Red, but not quite. More saccarhin and lacking warm Abbey or alcohol tones.  Like fresh canned or candied cherries. Good use of the cherry flavor is beer. Ethereal quality with some undescribable tones.  Palate is both fruity sweet and yet pit dry. Lucious. A tinge ascerbic. Finish is tart, dry, sewet and wonderfully lingering. A nice toasted mellow hop run on the backend.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
