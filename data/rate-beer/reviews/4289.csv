Precioso color dorado brillante, perfectamente transparente. Espuma blanca extraordinariamente cremosa y aún más extraordinariamente persistente, de burbuja media, que deja un bonito encaje de Bruselas. Fantástica carbonatación, con multitud de hilos de burbujas subiendo a la superficie incluso muchos minutos después de haberla servido. Inmejorable a la vista.

De intensidad media en nariz, da notas suaves de plátano y de manzana (tipo Reineta). También notas de malta y de pan blanco fresco, así como notas de frescor. Complejidad media, aunque sorprendente para ser una Lager.

De entre los sabores básicos destaca el dulce, bastante suave y en absoluto empalagoso. Es un dulce como de malta o de pan blanco. De fondo se deja sentir el amargo, dando un buen equilibrio al dulce preponderante. En el retro-gusto vienen de nuevo las notas de plátano (muy suaves, insisto) y manzana.

A pesar de que el aspecto y el aroma sugieren una cerveza ligera en boca, es más bien de peso medio, quizá por la sensación acumulada que el dulce deja en la lengua. Textura vivaz y carácter refrescante. Persistencia muy considerable para ser una Lager.

Una cerveza muy agradable de beber por su aspecto, aroma y textura en boca. Muy refrescante e indudablemente de trago largo. Especialmente recomendable para aquellos que se inician en el mundo de la cerveza artesana, así como para los veteranos con gusto por la buena cerveza alemana.

A: Pours a straw color with slight trails of carbonation. Theres a fingers worth of white-colored head, lacking in retention. Not much lacing is left behind.

S: Immediately after pouring, it reveals a nicely balanced backbone of crackers and bread. Theres an underlying sweetness, and an even further underlying noble hop bite. As it warms, the malts become faintly nutty. The aroma doesnt blow me away, but it does its job admirably. 

T: The maltiness reveals itself immediately with tones of lemon, cream, and even a touch of nuts. There isnt a whole lot to this beer, but the finish dries up enough to keep it from being too sweet. That, and its few notes are interesting enough to make me care about this one. 

M: Its carbonation is powerful and easy to note - however, the actual texture is nicely soft. Perhaps even milky. Of course, being milky means its a bit on the heavy/sweet side, but like I said before, its dry enough to not be overly sweet.

O: Tasty lager is tasty. Okay, MAYBE it could be a bit hoppier. Now that Im done nitpicking, Id just like to say even though it isnt mega-cheap ($3/500ml isnt BAD, though), Id gladly buy it again for drinking duty in hot weather.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

 Appearance  The beer pours a clear straw-yellow color with a huge billowy white head. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave a moderate level of foamy lace islands on the sides of the glass.

Smell  The aroma of the beer is quite heavy of lightly toasted pale malt smell mixed with lots of a biscuit and some caramel smells. Along with these aromas comes some lighter grainy smells as well as a little bit of a grassy aroma
 Taste  The taste begins with a caramel and toffee sweeter flavor mixed with a nice doughty taste. As the taste moves from the initial, some light grainy tastes as well as a lighter fruity flavor of both a sweeter apple and pear but also some lighter bitter lemon flavors enters the taste. The sweeter flavors fade ever so slightly as the taste moves on more toward the end, and with some more bitter herbal and grassy hop tastes coming to the tongue, one if left with a moderately crisp and very smooth flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thinner side with a carbonation level that is on the higher side. Both are fantastic for creating the crisp and very easy drinking feel for the brew. This is a superb feel for the flavors.
 Overall  A clean and very refreshing brew. This is quite flavorful and very easy drinking with a great crisp taste.","","Darkmagus82"

It includes notes of white bread and butter from the malts as well as noble earthy-flowery notes from the hops. On the palate, Ayinger Jahrhundert starts off with the malts with muted sweetness, then proceeds to earthy hops on the mid-palate before light bitterness and astringency kick in, and finally leaves some spiciness behind in the dry finish. The body is light and spritzy; it could come off as watery if the subtleties escape you.

4289,"2014-07-12",4.2,"500 ml bottle bought at Gorgeous Wine & Cigar in Yuen Long.
Looks: Light golden yellowExplosive three-finger head and crumpety white foam which lasts for 4 minutes; Excellent sticky lacing with very fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant, light sweet malt, with light touch of floral, spices and honey, plus bread, strong yeast, lemon and light grass.

Taste: Medium sweet malt, with honey, molasses, floral, light bread, yeast, lemon and light bitter grassy hops.

Body: Mid to light; Very slick and slightly thick palate.

Mouth feel: Wow, its pretty right-on here: maltyness is moderate, not too full. Body has right thickness but not oily. Very pleasant sweetness of honey and molasses - light and expressive - the kind of sweetness I longed for a Lager is here. Yea! Flowery hops and light bread to round off. This is very neat and lovely!

Hoppiness: Light floral, honey and spice in nose. Floral, lemon and fairly light grass in taste. Bitterness is light to the style for a lasting, fairly low-fi astringent finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Nicely sweet and hoppy to mouth.

Comments: This is a nice and delicate Helles. Everything from aroma, taste and palate is meticulously prepared to please the casual drinkers as well as picky connoisseurs. It may not be the absolute best, but its right up there as the poster boy of the style. I love it!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

4289,"2014-02-24",2.0,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2014 There seems to be almost two versions of this beer out there. Some taste brewery-fresh, some seem to smack of a winey character. The good ones taste of wonderfully bread like malt, with a very good hop flavor and aroma in support. 
The bad ones have an aroma of grape wine, with an odd fragrance of hops that I dont recognize; perhaps it is the wine like aroma fouling things up in the nose. It all comes off almost like the smell of a barn that hasnt been cleaned in a while.

Good body, but the flavor is all wrong. A wine like flavor takes front and center, and what malt is there is overwhelmed by the former problems. Id be inclined to pass this off as a bad bottle, but Ive had this same type of experience with this beer on a number of other occasions. It may be a problem with how the beer is handled in transport, or how it is handled at the distributors, but this beer does not live up to its reputation.

Smell: The nose is modest and offers mellow notes of biscuity pale malt with a nice spicy/floral hop backing. 

Taste/Palate: It has a light snappy flavor. Its pale bready maltiness is balanced by spicy floral hops that add pleasant bitterness and a very slight sourness. The finish is dry and crisp on a light to moderate palate.

4289,"2012-04-24",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2013 my last rating was in 2004 so it appears this one is worth a revisit.   from an undated bottle stored in a dark cooler.  with a proper pour into a flute it seems the rocky white head could last for hours.  malt-focused nose of fresh baked crackers and biscuits with a touch of honey is extremely light and delicate. with the soft mineral yeast character the nose becomes wonderfully full of life.  mouthfeel is fuller than expected of helles, and this one has a distinctly round and full syrupiness of malt.  hop aroma and bitterness are, of course, mild.  this particular bottle is exceptionally clean and seems fresh enough that I understand clearly what this beer is trying to be.  however, the malt is a tad too chewy and syrupy for my tastes. flavors of toasted crackers and barely-caramelized honey are enjoyable but seem to becoming more amplified than I want in lager, and they turn more towards baked corn kernels the longer I drink it.  still, minor complaints.  for bottled german lager available in my area, kept cold and out of light, this seems to be one of the better products youll find.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

4289,"2011-04-22",3.4,"Picked this bottle up at Chevy Chase in DC. Served in a pilsner glass.

Pour yields a golden brew that is nearly completely-transparent and has loads and loads of visible carbonation bubbles. An eggshell head forms and reaches four fingers high, leaving behind a ridiculous amount of lacing after it finally falls. The head is incredibly slow to follow, exhibiting rocky, whipped-cream-like peaks. The nose is a bit grainy with some mild sweetness coming through. Bready it is.

The taste falls along similar lines--theres some bread and grain up front followed by a smooth bitterness. The bitterness comes toward the finish and doesnt rally come along with much hop flavor. Good balance between the malt and hops. Drinks quite well. This would be a great brew on a hot summer day.

Appearance: It has an extremely clear and light yellow gold color with tons of bubbly carbonation. From the pour I got a tall white foamy head. This head is light, fluffy and slowly settles down to a light wispy thin covering. On the way down the glass it leaves some spotty lacing.

Smell: The nose is modest and offers mellow notes of biscuity pale malt with a nice spicy/floral hop backing.

Taste/Palate: It has a light snappy flavor. Its pale bready maltiness is balanced by spicy floral hops that add pleasant bitterness and a very slight sourness. The finish is dry and crisp on a light to moderate palate.

Nose: bread crust, crunchy dinner rolls, and the summer essence of fields of grain and straw as far as the eye can see. Not overly sweet; sense of rolls fresh from the oven. Crisp in the middle. Spring grass damp with dew and lemon peel.

Palate: soft and full bodied. Just like biting into fresh home-made loaves of white bread. Lemon peel refreshes, supporting her airy body. Green grass and damp dew. Exquisitely balanced. Dry underneath. Love the soft full mouthfeel which is neither too heavy nor too light.

Final Thoughts: quite simply what a real German lager/helles should and can taste like. A classic in her own right, I could easily while away an afternoon in the biergarten drinking multiple glasses of Jarhundert.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

When I saw that they were serving this from the wood, there was just no other option (not that it does anything for the flavor, but its just cool). Previous rating was from a bottle in the US, so I was ready for a wholly different experience. They were serving this in stoneware krugs so appearance was questionable, though the foam was very good. Very clean and fat malt aroma with just a touch of fruitiness. Big rich malt flavor and mellow hops. Its hard to explain how rich and malty this was without being overly sweet or less drinkable because of it. Soft and silky body. Just a big and very flavorful helles with lots of malt and barely any noticeable hops. I cant imagine the style getting much better. 

Original Rate: 50cl bottle. Slightly hazy with a lasting frothy white head. Medium gold in color. Herbal malty and a touch papery in the aroma.

The palate picks up where the nose leaves off; unabashedly malty, without being out of balance.  Again, bread, biscuits, and the unmistakable character of Munich malt come through.

4289,"2010-03-08",3.5,"This is an interesting Helles.  Pours light gold, slightly hazy, with a large white head.  Flavors and mouthfeel are pleasant, balanced; sweetness with just a hint of acid and bitterness on the taste, a light mouthfeel with a bit of stickiness balanced by a slight astringency.  Aromas are what make this.  They are the aroma of a classic Helles - hay and malt and a bit of hops - with a twist:  there are distinct notes of warm spice (allspice?) and spearmint in the aroma.  Also a bit of peculiar muskiness.  For a lager, this is quite interestingly nuanced.  But I dont feel the combination is brilliant.  A very good, interesting beer; falls short of a classic.","Michigan, USA","jodah52"
4289,"2010-03-01",3.6,"33cl bottle from K&L Redwood City.

Clear blond in color with good head retention and lacing.

This is a sweet one for sure. The pilsner malt really stands out. Theres a little graininess and some mild grassy hops.

This is not a style thats going to blow you away, but considering that, this beer is pretty solid. Sweet pilsner malt and grain are well-balanced by grassy hop bitterness. The term ""liquid bread"" really describes this one well, as the taste is a lot like a fresh loaf.

This one drinks more or less like a helles lager should. Its clean, crisp, and refreshing with a body on the lighter side. The carbonation level is about average.

As usual, Ayinger has done a solid job at crafting a solid example of the style theyre going for. Im not the biggest fan of light lagers, but if youre going to tie me up and force one down my throat, I definitely wouldnt mind if it were this one.

A thick white lacing pins the semi-cloudy and golden beer to the glass.  A bright and bubbly body sends out aromatic messengers, bearing an odd scent of botanical mass, a pleasant kind of glue, and a lot like the health supplement and foul tasting spirulina.  I absolutely cannot account for my nose on these notes, except that these images were conjured immediately and with vivacity, eagerly pushing me into the taste to see if a beer can indeed be brewed to mimic a foul, teal, foamy health drink.  Thankfully, the flavor takes a different tact, tasting a lot like fried plantains, backed by a layer of bitterness.

The head eventually becomes ""spotty"" by that I mean like little clouds on top of the beer in different spots that last till the very bottom, a very weird head retention, and one which I have never seen before.
The aroma is pleasant but somewhat faint, good grainy malt notes, and some fruitiness. 
The flavor is crisp and clean, lightly sweet with malt and slightly citrusy, the major flavor that took me off guard with this one was copper; this tastes very strongly of copper at the back of the mouth, more so than any beer I have ever tasted. 
This is a pleasure to drink and is very smooth and refreshing without sacrificing very much in flavor, it is in no way complex but it is remarkably different.

There is a surprising contrast from the advertised aroma in this very citrus, very tangy.....yet sweet flavor? A strong alcohol presence that folds into a heavy bodied sugar after taste.

Taste is incredibly smooth, this is one of the easiest drinking beers Ive had in awhile. A doughy and malty beer is balanced with a slightly fruity flavor and just the right amount of bitterness. A really nice beer for an easy drinking experience. I will certainly get more of this when Im not in the mood for something over the top but still want a good beer.

4289,"2007-11-22",2.0,"First aroma, when you pop the lid of this 17 oz bottle, is yeasty slightly citrus and some veggie cabbage. First taste has some of the cabbage carry over from the aroma.  look is slightly hazy pale yellow american lager. Has some bitter palate that is unexpected. Has more personality than many helles/dorts Ive had.  Decent carbonation. Interesting aftertaste of volatile industry rises up the olfactory after each taste. Overall not nearlyas enjoyable as   Edenton Helles Angel nor is it as good as Lowenbrau.  Probably one of the less enjoyable Ayings Ive had, but certainly better than   Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold.  On par with   Buzzards Bay Lager, Hansa Export

Good hop / malt balance, neither one is shy (esp. for the deceivingly pale color).

-A fluffy head laces complacently over the lightly fogged-up sunrays.
-A gentle aroma of doughy malts is subtle and unidimensional.
-Bready, doughy malts take a lot of room in the flavor profile.
-The mouthfeel is well-rounded by these malts, and is carbonated by fat but spaced bubbles.

What if you dig deeper?
-The aftertaste is too shy for my tastes.
-Feeble citrus fruit are dissolved within the nourishing doughy malt sweetness.
-Blades of straw and drops of milk are found when nitpicking.
-Immensely drinkable while giving the feeling of being fed, but too one-directional for my pleasure. Its quality cannot be avoided though.

Much smoother, and a lot more flavor and a fuller body.  Very sweet lightly caramelized malt with a hint of continental hops in the aroma and in the aftertaste.

4289,"2004-09-15",3.7,"I was pleasantly surprised at the finesse of this somewhat average looking member of its class. It has a typical honey gold pale lager color and a brief, thin pinkish head. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin and could perhaps use just a tad fuller carbonation; nevertheless there is still an Alpine strength to Jahrhunderts character, as if its thinness is ""natural"" like air at 12,000 feet (Im not sure of Ayings altitude but this is sort of the kind of thing Id expect Germans to make if they opened a brewery in the Rocky Mountains). Aromas are subdued yet clear and high-altitude flowery. This beer possesses a untart-dried-fruit malty flavor that is meant to be savored at any altitude. Its own description of a ""clean and long lasting"" aftertaste is quite accurate; the aftertaste could also be called quite hoppy and, again, high-altitude.

Aroma seems promising, lots of thick white bread, crusty and lightly sweet (honey, light toffee).  Plenty of mildly spicy hops and a hint of earthiness with bitter touches.  Flavor however, starts out lightly sweet (table sugar, light lemon drop cookies) with some bubbly texture from the vast carbonation.  Hops are not bitter, but provide a sweet, light apple flavor along with a touch of boring grassy flavors.  It never really came together for me, staying too sweet, with a strange thickly sweet palate.  It ends on a lightly bitter, lightly sour, meaty/appley note.  It wasnt terrible, but it thinned as it warmed and just didnt have any qualities I really enjoy about this style.  Especially, this wansnt crisp and powerfully flavorful.

4289,"2004-07-11",3.9,"500 ml brown bottle. No freshness date seen anywhere. Poured out a light, golden yellow, straw color. It had a volumous, white head at first, but it slid back to a thin veil of clumpy foam on top of the beer. It left a generous lacing down the sides of the glass as well. Aromas right away are of 2-row malts. Sweet, fresh mown hay, and slight amounts of phenolics are present as well. Smells like freshly gound grain, straight from the malt mill. Tastes are of very fresh malts, some slight yeastiness, some phenolics, slightly clove-like. It has just enough hops to balance the malts, but it is not bitter by any means. Very slight aroma of noble hops, and a subdued hop flavor. Medium mouthfeel, not cloying at all. A very drinkable beer overall. Goes down almost too easily. Would make a great lawnmower beer if it werent so hard to find in my area.

This beer would pair well with a pumpernickel and onion sandwich.","","Cobra"

There seems to be a big difference between those that are and those that arent...as of July 2004, there are ""those with over 160 ratings"" and ""thsoe with under 30 ratings"".  Uhh.  Slightly hazy yellow appearance, decent head.  Clean and crisp; somewhat sour finish.  Dry wheatiness throughout.  Sweet, a bit hoppy.

4289,"2004-06-23",3.6,"06.22.04  half liter bottle.  Light blond color, slightly hazed; firm head with fabulous lacing.  Aromas remind of buttery wheat crackers like Triscuits and a sweetish light malt.  Mouthfeel is full, creamy, and sweet.  Somewhat papery but that is cut short by a (very mild) hop finish reminding of chewing on a blade of wheat.  Very nice, what else is new from Ayinger.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
4289,"2004-06-20",4.5,"This is one fine brew! Pouring the beer throws a large , dense, white head. The color is a hazy yellow. Classic ""Bavarian"" taste. Reminds me of Spaten helles, or Wurzburger helles, but, MUCH better.  I would love to replicate this beer in a homebrew recipe, but, those lager yeast strains are a pain to work with.  Those Bavarian folks are sure lucky to have these sorts of brews available as every day beers!","tallahassee, Florida, USA","ESBFREAK"
4289,"2004-06-15",4.1,"Hazey sidewalk chalk yellow with a loosely placed thin white cap that dissapates quickly. Earns its keep with some sticky strings of lace and a thin collar. 

Aroma has a fair amount of slightly baked biscuit, sweet bread doughy malts are mostly prominent with nice ascents of grassy herbal hops.

Taste comes across richer then youd think with a nice malt base with pleasant sweet bread tones, sticky and creamy throughout the duration. The munich malts do their thing with a healthy dose of tender breads with a baked in warming. Hops are soft and supple in their supply with slight herbal spice and grasses. A very nice little taster. Great balance and feel which is nearly full for a Helles with a great smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Crisp little edge to the finish with nice lingering qualities of bread and grass.

4289,"2004-06-14",4.0,"In the bottle. The best part of this lager is the aroma. Smells like newly mown hay. Take your time. Sit down with this beer and remember those summers when you would sit on the side of Mrs. Southerns hill and watch Dewey Burdine mow the fields with his blue Ford tractor. Poofy white head that hangs in there the way those Simpsons clouds did on that same day of making hay. Smooth and mellow to drink. Soft, in fact. As soft as the hillside fescue and clover mix Im sitting upon on that summer day. It must have been a hundered years ago...","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","SledgeJr"

Very fruity and cirtusy.  Maybe some banana.  Not much bitterness like some previous ratings suggest.  Short lived sweet aftertaste.  Id say the commercial description hits the nail on the head when they say ""The taste is pure malt"" but way off on the long lasting aftertaste.

Very clean, grainy, very malty, pale-toffeeish flavor with mild, grassy hops and some acidity. Long, moderately bitter and acidic finish. Medium-bodied, smooth and neutral, refreshing palate with soft carbonation. No signs of alcohol. Really a ""back to basics"" brew with clean, neutral maltiness, balancing (although somewhat sparingly dosed) hops, plus an awesome drinkability.

(Bottled, at the Helsinki Beer Festival 2004, was 7-2-7-3-14=3.3) Typical lager color, small head. Slightly sour and malty aroma. Original, malty flavor. Slightly sour and earthy (hay?). Not bad for a lager.","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"

This is a rather refreshing brew, probably excellent in the warmer months.  Finish is a bit quick for my tastes, and I would like a bit more carbonation.  Drink it quick, this didn't warm very well in my opinion. Overall, a respectable offering.","oxford, Georgia, USA","Hangover"

4289,"2004-03-14",3.1,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2004 This beer makes me want to cry after having an Ayinger Brau-Weisse.  The aroma would be more aptly called a smell.  The taste reminds me of a disturbing night of St. Pauli's girl.  Stick with the Brau-weisse.***Re-rate about six months or so later:
Wow!  It's really funny how your tastes change.  This is a really good beer.  In comparison to Brau-Weisse, maybe this isn't awesome, but it's a pretty good beer.
