Thanks, Chris!

To say I was excited about this would be the understatement of the century. Ever since I tried AleSmiths Barrel-Aged Wee Heavy, Ive been kind of obsessed with the style. Once Chris showed me that this was coming up from The Bruery in increments of six, 12 and 18 months, I instantly wanted to try all three. Cant wait to get this underway.

Poured an auburn, dark amber, murky color with two fingers of khaki tan, frothy head. Above average spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. Above average retention on the top all the way down. (Sight - 4.00)

Smelled sticky caramel, toffee, boozy bourbon up front, but mellowed out, light tobacco, faint dates, some butterscotch (wishful?) and brown sugar. (Smell - 4.00)

Taste followed the nose. This definitely needs some more time, coming in a tad hot. Getting caramel, toffee, somewhat boozy bourbon, brown sugar, vanilla (didnt recognize this on the nose), hints of dried tobacco, some oaky wood and muted butterscotch. (Taste - 4.00)

Medium body. Creamy texture. Average-to-lively carbonation. Long, boozy, warming finish. (Feel - 4.00)

God I wanted this one to be better. I think it will be with time, but not quite there yet. Looking forward to comparing with the 12 and 18-month versions. (Overall - 4.00)
