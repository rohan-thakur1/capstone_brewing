Looking forward to this one after seeing the overall rating on Beer Advocate about two minutes before writing this. Bought this basically because its Marble and I havent tried this one yet. Nice to not always have IPAs. 

Poured an auburn, clear color with two fingers of frothy, khaki head. Rather serene setting underneath the head. Very good lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.25)

Very nice on the smell, getting a great mix of malts and hops. Specifically getting caramel, toasted malts, buttery malts (but not overwhelming which I hate), Mosaic, spicy, dry Chinook, rye, iced tea, spoiled vegetables and light garbage. (Smell - 4.00)

Taste wasnt quite as good as the nose, but decent. Getting toasted malts, buttery caramel malts, dry rye hops, Mosaic, spicy Chinook, sweetened iced tea, spoiled green beans, hints of tropical notes, mainly passion fruit, bitter pine and some woody Nugget. (Taste - 3.75)

Medium body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt, toasty finish. (Feel - 3.75)

This one had its moments, but couldnt pull the trigger on higher ratings. Might have underrated the smell a tad. Decent beer though. (Overall - 3.75)

2375,"2016-01-19",3.9,"Pours reddish brown. Minimal little head. Aroma is pine, grapefruit/citrus, a little bread/dough-y and some caramel malts. But more hop than malt on the nose. The mouthfeel is a little more sharp than expected based on the aroma. The flavor is a little matlier than I expected, but is still yeasty and hoppy with citrus and pine.

Medium body, silky mouthfeel, above average carbonation, and a smooth slightly bitter finish. I never really enjoyed reds until I tried this one. Truly an amazing beer. The malty backbone is balanced perfectly by the clean hop bitterness, making this quite enjoyable. The fresh hops really come through in both aroma and taste.

Deep orange-brown pour with a modest head. Nose brings some of the metallics that previous raters were glad not to detect, along with spicy pine. The flavor is a very fine balance of c-hop drive with sweetish caramel malt backing. Prickly mouthfeel from the abundant carbonation.

The aroma is lots of fresh hops, lots of grapefruit, lots of floral stuff... not a lot else, but totally inviting and totally awesome smelling. 

The flavor follows as expected, very hoppy and on the higher end of bitterness. The hops are juicy and citrusy, the beer has some fresh crisp malt character without a lot of sweetness.

This would score higher if not for personal preferences...its not really flawed, per se, its just not the sort of execution I like.  First issue is the hop odor...just not a fan of that rough resinous-grapefruit rind treatment.  Just too reminiscent of floor polish etc.  Likewise, in the mouth its rather citric/acidic, which Im not a fan of, even though its overall well-balanced.  But its clean, looks great, and has a nice mouthfeel.

Coppery colour more than red. Excellent hop presence in the aroma - a good mix of pine, grapefruit and herbaceous. Just a touch of toffeeish malt.  Firm hoppy stuff on the palate too.

The malts are semisweet and solid, laying a nice, earthy foundation for the beer, but the all-star lineup of hops never makes an impression.  The citric and piney notes are subtle, too much so for such a heavy, caramel-leaning malt load.  Still, I find myself continuously sipping this pint, so dont take me too seriously.

2375,"2010-06-15",3.7,"A soft pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a one finger thick, nicely tanned head.  The beer is a dark, concentrated red hue that shows a clear, bright ruby hue when held up to the light.  Ahh, the aroma is explosively hoppy, this is most certainly not a malt focused, forgettable Red-Ale; packed with enough hops to scream look at me.  Aromas of dank herbaceousness, fresh cut pine needles, spicy-oily citrus, dirty grapefruit, lychee, big tangelo zest aromatics and, quite simply, a note that smells characteristically of hemp that it makes me think I have become lost in some hippy party.

The beer is quite bitter tasting, and much more light bodied than I was expecting; but that makes for extreme quaffability.  Despite the rich color the malt character plays a much subdued role here; much of this is just a perception because of the over-the-top hop character that contributes flavors of pine sap, dank hemp oil, green tobacco, and a biting herbal, peppery bitterness.  A secondary hop character of grapefruit, lychee, and bright bergamot is noticeable just behind the herbal hop character.  There is actually a little bit malty, even if it is quite subdued; there are touches of toasted malt, some light caramelized malt character as well as a nicely caramelized biscuit note that are just barely noticeable as the beer warms up a bit more.  The malt tends to linger in the finish after the abrasive hop character has had a chance to dissipate.

Wow, what an aggressively hoppy beer; I was expecting this to be hoppy, but the hop character has completely drowned out the malts that are only noticeable because of the rich color that this beer has.  This might even be more hoppy than the IPA, at least to my poor shocked tasted buds that were expecting a somewhat malt balanced beer.  This is a fantastically tasty, if you are a die-hard hophead.  This is definitely not the most balanced beer, nor is it delicate and soft, make not mistake this is an in your face, harsh, explosive, celebration of the hop.  This is a definitely must try session beer for the hop-heads out there.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

It pours with a frothy off-white head, under which a clear red-brown body glows with anticipation.  The aroma is hoppy, leaning toward herb, pine, and resin smells.  Minimal citrus character in the aroma.  Flavor is a sophisticated balance of sweet caramel and strong hops.  Once it hits your tongue, the grapefruit aspect of American hops can be detected, along with a more earthy bitterness.  This brew clings to your tongue and leaves a complex aftertaste that is clean and satisfying.  Good stuff.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","blazingspiral"
