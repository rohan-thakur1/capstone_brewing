2191,"2014-09-23",3.5,"""The only imperial octoberfest I can think to compare this to is the Kaiser, which was much sweeter. This managed a better balance of semi sweet caramel malt and a bigger dose of hops without being cloying. If not for the rather alcoholic finish, would have scored very high. Still the best new octoberfest of 2012?""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

2191,"2013-07-08",3.6,"Bomber, about $6 from Sprayberry Bottle Shoppe, Marietta (I think they still have some, if anyone wants to try to find this one). Pours a deep hazy red with about 2 fingers of off-white head. Aroma is big caramel and quasi-Belgian yeast. Taste is caramel malts, some yeastiness, and a peppery hop finish. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. I probably should have had this several months ago when I bought it, since this has not aged particularly well. Overall, this is a good beer for the money, but honestly tastes more like a ""Red IPA"" than an Oktoberfest.","Georgia, USA","finn1918"

The nose is somewhat nutty with a nice caramel and bread malt profile, and some lightly roasted bitterness and a bit of a creamy note as well. The flavor is pretty much the same with some nice caramel bread and more bitterness and nuttiness than the nose suggested.

Medium body, slick texture, carbonation isnt too high, but very active. Finish is pronounced and long with an excellent malt aftertaste. Certainly isnt very lager-ish.

Its pretty crisp and the alcohol is not noticeable. The flavor has caramel goodness with plenty of cereal and bittersweet wooden notes. The hops definitely manage to come through on this one, but arent extra strong. Pretty decent, especially for a Georgian brewery who specializes in ales.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
2191,"2012-10-28",2.9,"22 ounce bottle - $5.99 at Sherlocks in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours a good, clear body with a dark amber/copper vibe to it and a fairly sustained, frothy, off-white head.

Smell: Heavily toasted bready malts wrapped in candy-esque sweet-scented notes and some low-lying alcohol. Some growing notes of baked apple, brown sugar, and well-ground spice as it warms. Im a little nervous to continue, frankly. I mean, we could have another straight-up The Kaiser on our hands, folks.

Taste: Breadcrusts, well toasted, with some faint, faint dough and caramel. Lightly sweetish. Fruity touch of skins-on apples. Spicy, herbal hops (even a tad minty) with bitterness, but, thats when the traces of staunch alcohol crackle across the tongue. Dry, lightly bitter, warming finish with a whisper of untoasted nuts.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Not nearly as rough or as ghastly as Averys The Kaiser. Yes, folks, we dodged a The Kaiser on this one.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

The taste was a bit more concentrated than the typical Oktoberfest beer, which is to be anticipated considering the strength.  The toasted malts and clean lager character were spot on.

Aroma of toasted grains; grassy, wooded, earthy hop nose. A touch of oaky vanilla scent.  Smells like an oaked Vienna.  Loads of flavor, dispite not being carbonated, its tasty.  Loads of toasted barley flavor, sweet,  a touch of nuts, musty caramel, wood, and a spicy note blended in.  A touch on the boozie side.  Alcohol is noticable.  Nice lingering bitterness.  Hops are in quite an abundance.  Earthy, grass, wooded, and even some herbal spicy hops. The hop forward character of this beer. leads me to believe this is more of an Imperial Vienna.
