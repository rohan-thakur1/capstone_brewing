Nose is first to hint at the modern crossover style undertaken here: buttered brown bread meets jenever-marinated raisins, toffee and fruit jam caramels in mild doses - an impressionistic ""lager"" version of many a Belgian dark ale. - Taste is rich and layered, composing sticky toffee, caffe crema, dried figs and cassonade brune against a both malty and hop-derived grassy-herbal bitterness, reminding me of La Trappe, sealing the fruity-sweet deal before a rich milk chocolate and liquorice finale. - Slightly sticky mouthfeel like butterscotch, mild carbo. Long bittersweet, lipsmacking and astringently dry finish (chestnut peel). - Easily drinkable and moderately light, in comparison with many Doppelbricks of this strength. Abv very well hidden. Almost like a bottom-fermented RHG version of La Trappe IsidOr - (coincidentally maybe also the only Trappist brewry that still makes a bock?).

1217,"2010-09-29",3.5,"This was the only beer from Ettaler I was willing to try from the Binnys in Lincoln Park, Chicago. It was sitting on the top shelf in the warm section, exposed to ultra-bright fluorescent light and some of the labels on the other bottles showed signs of age and rough handling. That being said, the pour produced a crystal clear deep mahogany colour with a soapy beige head that I could only get to form with the most vigorous of pours. The nose, below some mineral notes (aluminum and iron), has some surprisingly pleasant aromas (given the condition of the bottle and improper storage) of black cherry, fig, rich caramel, toffee, a whisper of anise and faint chocolate. The flavour, while slightly skunked, still has a lot going for it. As it warms, full flavours of fig, cherry, cola, caramel, tobacco, licorice  and noble hops. The palate is chewy up front, slick in the finish, and the carbonation could use a little more psi and some finer bubbles. I will be in Munich in a month, so Ill re-rate then.

Aroma: The nose is a little skunky with some light roasted notes and a malt undercurrent. 
Appearance: It pours a ruddy brown with a sizeable foamy, light tan head.  Good head retention. 
Taste: Very malty with a twinge of a metallic note.  That note flows in and out amidst dark caramel, raisin, and pumpernickel notes. 
Palate: Medium to rich in body with a coating mouthfeel, lower carbonation, and a lingering raisin and dark malt finish. 
Overall: I can do without the metallic note, but this is a nice winter brew.  Rich and filling, its not one to session per se but to enjoy slowly.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

1217,"2010-08-19",3.6,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 1 pint .9oz bottle into a dimpled mug. The abv is listed at 9% and there is no freshness date.

Appearance: It has a dark brown, almost black body with deep reddish highlights. On top it has a small one finger tall tan head which quickly fades to a ring of foam around the edge of with a thin film covering. Buy the end there was no head at all and lacing was nil.

Smell: Deep malty sweetness dominates the nose. There are hints of burnt caramel, dark brown sugar and herbal earthy hops.

Taste/Palate: It has a firm full body with a heavy slick texture and light carbonation. This gives it a coating effect with its deep rich malty sweetness. For me it seems a bit too sweet but complex as well. It has notes of deep caramelized sugar, bread crust, light toast, brown sugar, raison and lots of prune notes. It finishes with lots of residual sweetness then a short herbal/leafy/earthy bitterness which struggles to add some sense of balance.

Picked up at Binnys in downtown Chicago I was looking forward to this.  Unfortunately I found it somewhat disappointing.  Whether it was a bit past its prime or my palate was not in the mood something did not concur with the opinion of many previous raters.  I think I may buy this again when I am in the mood for a run of doppelbocks and compare it to some others on the market.

Aroma / Appearance - Short lived and cascading downwards into the glass I observed a wonderful flow of reddish brown semi-opaque in character.  Chocolate dipped cherry pits, figs, malts, and something stale give it life.  Sourdough bread and red wine gave it a nice depth.  The total experience was solid but somehow less than what I was expecting at the time.

Flavor / Palate - Raisin bread, bitter chocolate, and warm muffins kick the palate awake.  Very dark and rich it might have been a bit too much at the time.  The letdown was the dry finish which lacked anything complex.  Ultimately this was not a terrible beer and revisiting it has me questioning my original feelings but unless this makes it to Ohio I will have to wait a while.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1217,"2009-10-25",4.0,"Location: .5 liter bottle from State Line, 10/25/09


Aroma: A complex aroma that includes berries, fig, toffee, caramel, coffee, raisin, bread, roasted malts, licorice, and more.  

Appearance: A nice brown color with a slight red hue, a thin tan head, and no lace.

Flavor: Flavor is quite similar to the nose in both complexity and make-up; however, I do note an increase in licorice and less fruitiness.  Still, the flavor is quite complex with an interesting mixture of sweet, malty flavors.

Palate: Medium in body and quite low in carbonation, this beer has a decent, though not outstanding mouthfeel

Overall Impression:
Really quite an interesting beer.  What a first impression it gives when you open it up and get a whiff.  Its hard to oversell the wonderful complexity of the nose on this one.  I really thought it was quite interesting, almost reminded me of a nice Belgian quad in that you just dont usually see a level of complexity like this one in many other styles.  I would definitely recommend trying this one out.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

I always jump at the chance to have a doppelbock I haven’t seen, in the hopes that there will be a challenger to Celebrator.  Alas, the search continues (although this got the closest of any).  Murky brown in the glass looks a little watery, the head is thin and barely lasting, but produces some nice ""racing.""  Smell doesn’t fill the sinuses like the best of them, but it’s pretty strong, and is kind of wonderful:  dark bread, toffee, caramel, and underneath is a wonderful winey fruitiness.  Fairly light bodied, definitely as thin as it looked, but the flavor buoys the feel to keep this from being watery: initial mouthful of bready, toffee malts that coat the whole mouth, pretty strightforward but delicious; then, they fade and you are about to ask, ""Is that it?"" when a second layer surges forward with darker, almost woody malt flavor that is reminiscent of the winey notes in the aroma with overripe fruits, fruitcake, and twigs.  It’s not dry, but I can’t seem to get any spittle on top of my tongue; maybe that’s the alcohol, but there isn’t any other indication of it.  Damn nice doppelbock.

1217,"2008-02-07",3.2,"A small off-white head quickly departs from the clear, darkish mahogany beverage. Whew! Rich nose, heady and warming just from the smell. Mostly focused on fruitiness. Theres obviously a fair toasted munich base, but your attention resides on fruity alcohol. I would not call it vinous, but the vapors are strong enough that it reminded of Cognac. Nutty and lightly roasty upon the finish. Neglectable hops. I was a bit surprised at the lightness of the palate, light-medium bodied at most, but the texture is silky. It flows and rolls on the tongue. Comfortable indeed, but the effervescent bite removes a bit from the enjoyable fruitiness. Its dark grapes, cherries and blackberries, with enough dark, almost roasted malts to avoid any juicy impression. Sweet, but certainly under control in that department, never cloying and more warming than anything, the body is light enough to avoid any stickiness. A serious and rich example that does not quite strike the sensible never with me. I prefer a very focused toastiness and less alcohol. Complex lager though.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

1217,"2007-12-08",3.9,"Recieved September 2006, Sampled December 2007
Pours with an initially, almost three-finger thick, lightly darkened, tan colored head that has a bit of staying power to it.  The beer sits in my glass a concentrated, blackened, amber tinged color but does show a brilliantly clear, concentrated ruby red color when held up to the light.  Rich, sweet malt aromatics define the nose of this beer.  Almost no hop aromatics, in fact I cant really smell any.  Aromas of figs, richly caramelized malt, broiled raisins, musty concentrated dark fruits.  The aroma has almost smells like it has cork taint, that musty, slightly off cork smell of TCA seems to be here, but I have no idea how that could be.  This may just be a bit of oxidation setting in, but it is a bit unusual for it to take this form.  Irregardless, the aroma is rich and malty enough that it is able to overcome this and still remain quite enjoyable.

Sweet and richly concentrated malt notes as well as brandy like warming alcohol flavors are noticeable in the first sip.  This is really rich and chewy, without being overly sweet though; the malt sugars here are complex enough that the sweetness is not cloying.  This is definitely a meal in a glass; the heft of this brew is impressive, it has both a viscous weight to it and a palate coating quality that sticks to the mouth even after a sip has been swallowed.  A touch more hoppy than the aroma suggested, there are hints of herbal (at times even menthol like), hop derived flavors here as well as a soft, fleeting, though lingering, hop bitterness in the finish.  Clearly though this beer is about the malt.  Concentrated & powerful, flavors of dark chocolate, toasted grain, lightly bitter burnt malt and dark whole grain toast provides a slight counterpoint to the sweeter malt flavors.  As the beer warms & loses the medium carbonation it becomes much more creamy feeling, though it also begins to pick up a touch of that TCA like mustiness from the aroma.

What a tasty, totally rich & satiating, thoroughly enjoyable beer, while the lack of that TCA like component would have made this perfection in a glass, it still does not hurt it enough to make this less that incredible.  This is exactly what I have been looking for in a Doppelbock lately.  If you are a malt lover, you have got to try this beer, it will totally satisfy any malt cravings you may have.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

1217,"2007-08-15",4.2,"Pours a clear blood red, absolutely gorgeous hue, resembling a filtered cabernet with blackberry syrup added. Really just an astonishing hue, in any medium. A creamy beige head with slight creamsicle hues fades slowly, never fully, leaving behind lacing that looks like oily paintings of dirty-snow-capped mountain ranges off in the distance. The aroma is loaded with character, malty as all get out and fun to attmept to break down. Notes of caramel, plums, licorice sticks, raisins, espresso beans, vanilla, toffee, hints of chocolate, peaches and banana. What a blend! The flavor is an understated competition crusher, bearing down on the palate without overdoing anything or becoming scattered, muffled or mismanaged. Dark fruits and roasty malts, plenty of cereal grains, light tartness and caramel galore all meld into a delightful flavor. Sweetness is medium-high and never nears cloying due to its endearing counterparts and loads of accomplices in this treasure of a taste. Bitterness is low to mild, no acidity but for the hints implicated by a light, tart fruitiness near the end of each sip. The level of grain present is somewhat surprising but doesnt jar the flavor into something less than easily enjoyable and easygoing. The finish is raisiny, sweet and completed by lingering caramel and chocolate notes, slight nuttiness too, drying out signifigantly. The mouthfeel is zippy with good carbonation(even though it doesnt feel very natural), medium-full body, very smooth and a touch clumped/sticky. Smooth as hell nonetheless. Very impressive; one of very few Dopplebocks I enjoy more than the cult standard, Ayinger Celebrator. Fantastic and underrated!","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Its a bit more bitter in the aftertaste than Id prefer as well, but it keeps it from being too sweet.  Id also like to see some dark fruit character, but as I said, maybe age had something to do with it.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

Aroma of raisins, toasted malts, toffee, brown sugar, and way in the background some slight anise and spearmint.  Flavor is slightly oxidized with some alcohol in addition to the aforementioned flavors.  This wasnt quite as sweet as the aroma led on and theres a pretty good amount of toast and molasses in the flavor.  Bitterness is low--3 on a 1-10 scale.

1217,"2007-02-02",3.6,"Dr. Pepper brown, dark yet clear with a lasting white head. Vegetal notes take a long time to fade above the dry, roasty malts below. A toffee sweetness also gets covered. It opens up late with additional ABV notes. Light stickiness to a smooth, middle-weight body. Theres no denying the alcohol which appears up-front in the flavor from the get-go. Sweet, caramely dark malts precede a quick finish of bitters. Oh yes. Finally. Let this warm.

Its more like a scotch ale.  Syrupy, tart, hints of smoke.  Not nearly a mouthfeel worthy of the worlds finest doppelbocks.  Wheres the cracklng, crisp flavor-burst at the finish?
Noteworthy points for appearance.  Not the deepest dark doppel, mind you, but a big fat head, exactly a thumbs width.  Doesnt live up to the appearance standards of Pamela Andersons GREAT ASS! in her prime, but by beer standards, its nevertheless wood-inducing.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"

1217,"2007-01-14",4.0,"Pours a very deep brown, almost black with a two finger head that settles quickly to a thin cap. Even with the head fading so quickly the cap stays around for a long time, and theres more lacing than I expected.

Smell; mild hints of chocolate with a sweetness that reminds me of honey. Darks fruits are definitely present, but I cant see to pick anything out specifically.

Taste; chocolate cake and prunes are the first things that come to mind on the first couple of sips. And Im surprised to say that the combination works for me. The honey-like sweetness is there, as well as a slightly nutty bitterness in the finish. This is different than any other dopplebock that Ive ever had, and I like it alot.

-A ring of foam circles the clear, regal burgundy.
-Black grapes, raisins, and figs are all slowly caramelizing in the nose.
-Roasted malts are accompanied by a plethora of dark fruit, namely blackberries and raisins.
-The healthy mouthfeel is helped by the smooth carbonation.

What if you dig deeper?
-Alcohol is very well hidden for this gravity, making this a rather drinkable doppelbock.
-The flavor spectrum isnt too large, but quite complex within its range.

Clear deep brown color with red highlights and a fine, receding off-white head.  Flavor seems to really come alive at around 60 deg.

Huge topping of dark ivory foam thats loose, puffy, fluffy, and thick. Didnt sit for too long before slipping to its always present thick skim and concentrated bubbly center. Lots of great looking inky lacing coats the glass. A beautiful bock to behold!
Aroma is tenderly dark and sweet with semi tanged molasses thats deeply centered in a root beer soaked fruit bread dusted with cooked brown sugar and currants.
Taste is seemingly similar to what the smell leads ya too. A good thing here as this is quite solid in taste, flavor, and body. Smooth and luscious in a thickly coating dark maltyness that brings in a nice molasses tang thats mildly tanged and slow. Nice notes of brown sugar, dark fruity chewy things, caramel, chocolate, and a good portion of length into the finish. By far the best area of the beer. It transcends into its own as it finishes very lengthy with a stretched out dark malty coating and tiny warming.
Nearly perfect for a Doppel in body. Nice easy front with a steady medium body gaining a very complex tone into the finish as the dark malts gain in flavor, body texture, and warmth. Very easy goin down with a great gooey little texture of smoothness. Ahhh, malts, malts, and more malts. Solidly good.
Drinkable and then some. Only a slight hint of warmth after a while begins to settle in as ya go and tends to slow it down. But for a Doppelbock, this is very solid and a showcase of the style.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Appears a deep mahogany toned brown with crimson toned edges when held to the light. A nice, fluffy, light tan head slowly fades out into a rocky film. Tiny speckles of lacing are left around the glass.
Smell is of rich, doughy, roasted nuts, brown sugar, vanilla, maple, molasses, caramel, cocoa, and even a hint of light cherries, along with tropical fruit highlighted by mango.
Taste is of the same wonderful aromas. It definitely lives up to the true German Doppelbocks that many crave in the U.S.
Low carbonation makes this one very smooth but at the same time a tad bit slick along the palate. It starts off biscuity sweet and sort of fades out with a mildly thin slickness that I wish had a bit more backbone for substantiation.

1217,"2006-09-18",4.0,"From a 1 pt. 9 oz. euro brown bottle with no bottled/freshness date.

Poured a ruby hued dark brown with a foamy off-white/beige head that settled into a thin, slightly sudsy lacing.

Aromas of figs and port, molasses, caramel toffee swirls, a light sour cherry juiciness, and a very subtle whiffs of alcohol.

Moderate carbonation and a crisp, dryish, velvety smooth light-medium bodied mouthfeel.

Good doppelbock taste, more raisins than figs, a light sour cherry, licorice, bready, a kind of coffee, caramel, toffee candied swirl, a little molasses as well, the alcohol is well masked, but provides a nice warmth in palate, and a dry malty finish.

Just hit the shelves of one of the liquor stores I frequent, great doppelbock drinkability, very quaffable, if you like doppelbocks, then this is a must try.","East Central, Georgia, USA","jpm30"

Baked candied apples and a touch of sweetened black currant come in on consecutive sniffs.  Big flavor cannon hums with shae butter, caramelized pecans and chocolate toffee.  Concord and chocolate rye elicit a bright flavor spot, and a buoyant viscosity slide sdown the hatch with accents of coal and buttered rum.  Lightening throat hum is preceded by edible tweed.  Brown sugar is caramelized over figgy pudding, transitioning to a sweet (and graham cracker laden) mince meat pie persona.  Thick, chewy liquid bread with formidable, palatable aptitude.

Additional overtone of smoke and molasses dance across the palate. Not for everyone but malt lovers should enjoy this bier. The best part is that is doesnt come off cloy or over-the-top.

1217,"2006-07-03",4.2,"The label on this 500 ml. bottle of Dunkler Doppelbock claimed to be brewed from an historic recipe of 1609 created by the Benedictine Monks.  Since Paulaner Salvator, the first commercially brewed Doppelbock, didnt become available to the public until 1780, this recipe must either go back to the origins of this style as food during Lenten fasting.

Poured out into a flute, this was quite dark in color, and had a two finger head at first.  The head faded quickly to a very thin ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass.  As can be expected with a 9% ABV beer, there was not much lacing.  The aroma was very rich, with the dark Munich style malts allowed to emit a toasty sweet smell.  The taste was also sweet, but not cloying.  The dark fruit ester taste was very dominant here, and was followed shortly by a spicy phenolic kick.  Although they did not use any malted wheat in this recipe, this was somewhat similar to a Weizenbock.  This was quite an easy beer to drink considering all the complexity and strength.  No wonder this Abbey/Brewery has been around since 1330.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

1217,"2004-10-26",3.4,"Dark red color with hints of brown, off-white head lasted long. Strongly sweet and fruity aroma with notes of roasted syrupy and alcohol. Flavor is very ordinary: starts with mild roasted side, ends with overly sweet and vinous aftertaste, which lasts long. 7.0% ABV is covered pretty much, comes up slightly as vinous aftertaste. For me, mild aroma was slight disappointment, flavor differs some other doppelbocks, but not in bad way.","Tampere, FINLAND","Jukkabro"

Sweetish & roasted taste, like mulled beer, caramelised in a short, hot way. Retronasal there are some good German hops. Just a bit thin mouthfeel, certainly for a Doppelbock.
