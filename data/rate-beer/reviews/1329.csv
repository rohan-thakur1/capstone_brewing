Pour was a beautiful dark burnt red with a one finger light tan head. Taste was full and malty. All the flavors of the aroma were big and mouth filling.

1329,"2017-02-06",3.6,"Poured from a bomber bottle into a pint glass to drink. The beer had a pretty cloudy and hazy dark amber-copper color that was almost brown with a ruby hue and a good-sized foamy white head with shorter retention, good cling and lacing. its aroma featured roasty caramel and barley malt along with some light toffee and bits of pine and grainy hops. The taste was mostly a sweet caramel-toffee blend with a slightly roasty burnt taste and a mild and subtle grainy bitterness. It had a fairly full and thick mouthfeel with a somewhat creamy body and average to low carbonation.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Derek881"

1329,"2017-01-24",4.1,"I will admit bias towards this style of beer but the flip side of that is that this is one of the few beers that truly changes depending on how it is served. Whether it be bottled,on tap or on a nitro tap, it seems to evolve. My favorite method is on Nitro which for me isnt a common thing to say, but if you find a place that has a keg of this on nitro,sit down and be ready to be surprised. 

It comes out a dark amber colour and holds a commendable amount of carbonation for a style that is typically known to go flat fast, the pour methods previously mentioned seem to extend both the time and bring out subtleties in the brew that otherwise seem to lost from the bottle.

From the bottle it seems to be smooth yet consistently sharp as it finishes in terms of palate, which if consumed with a good pairing or used in cooking a meal like a beef stew with a sour dough bread bowl (something I have done often), can be very rewarding.

Considering its potential to be bitter,it seems very balanced, healthy amount of malt,carbonation,smooth taste,sharp finish,tendency to lace well and over all holds a profile that lends itself to be either consumed directly or used in cooking year round. Next experiment will be to use it for beer battered fried chicken.","","Dmcman85"

1329,"2016-05-21",3.3,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a deep mahogany brown color with a one finger head of tan colored foam. The head fades rather fast leaving a good deal of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell- The aroma of the brew is strong of a roasted malt and molasses smell. Along with these aromas comes some other smells of caramel and darker fruits with just a hint on a floral hop note.
 Taste  The taste begins much drier then I would have anticipated from the nose, starting with just a hint of caramel sweetness mixed with a rather stronger roasted bready taste. As the taste advances the caramel upfront fades away with a light dark fruity flavor taking its place. At the same time some hop flavors of a grassy and floral hop taste mixed with a little bit of graininess come to the tongue and with a light earthy hop coming at the very end, one is left with a rather dry and roasty taste to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel- The body of the brew is on the thinner side with a carbonation level that is rather low. The low carbonation is nice for the style, but a thicker body would have accentuated the roasty flavors slightly better. Overall, it was an OK feel.
 Overall  I have to say I am a bit disappointed with this Ballast Point brew. They normally do most all styles nice, but this was way too dry and flavorless for a Scottish ale in my opinion. Certainly not their best","","Darkmagus82"

1329,"2015-06-14",3.8,"This was poured into an English pint glass.
The appearance was a slightly dark amber to ruddy brown color with a one and a half finger white foamy rocky head that dissipated within less than a minute. Light speckled and messy lacing roamed about the glass.
The smell started off with a slight baked apple leading into a light caramel malt and then a slightly roasty nuttiness rolling about.
The taste was matly sweet carrying the light apple into the caramel and having a slight roastiness about it. Rolling nuttiness combined with the caramel and apple leads into the aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the palate with a nice sessionability about it. Carbonation seems fairly refined but still good for a Scottish ale and for me as it leads to a slight creamy texture.
Overall, as a Scottish ale, I dig it. Its good and has some good aspects going on and this would be great with its respected food.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly lasting.
Body is dark amber.

Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium body, velvety/watery texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic, lightly to moderately astringent.

A solid, easy-drinking brew. Rather timid but pleasant nose, and quaffable flavor balance makes it easy to enjoy, as does the nice color and fairly well-lasting head.

1329,"2013-12-23",3.3,"April 15th, 2012 - Scottish Ales dont seem like promising beers for the San Diego beerscape. Its sweet, not hoppy, dark, not light, and probably makes a surly companion on a hot day. But that didnt stop Ballast Point from attempting to graft San Diegan beer culture onto the style. The product of this cross-cultural brewing begins with a wet and clean nose, delivering a smooth malt profile, and the wet, shaggy sprouted malt that defines the aroma of a brewery on a brew day. Most noticeable on the tongue is the absence of the peat and deep, malty sugars that tend to define Scotch ales for me. The flavor profile is still very distinctive though, featuring a heavy, substantial palate, thats just weighty enough to balance against a busy carbonation. The malt taste is crystal clear and poignant, semisweet, and extremely drinkable. The complexity between the shades of sweet, sugar and graininess is underwhelming, and the total absence of hops or any balancing astringency doesnt help. Perhaps, in the effort to use ab abundance of UK-centric ingredients, the potential for something a little deeper was sacrificed, but its still an interesting riff on the Scotch Ale style.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

1329,"2007-07-08",4.6,"On tap at Hamiltons. Classic 80 Schilling / Export Scottish Ale.  Clean aroma with no ale yeast esters (low fermentation temp?).  Roasty, caramel aroma with small bubbles.  I thought that the color was a little dark.  When held to a light the candy cane red comes through (long boil?).  Brilliant clarity.  Balanced flavor.  Low bitterness but a dryness from a roasted grain. No peat flavors though. Malty aftertaste lingers.  A great session ale.
