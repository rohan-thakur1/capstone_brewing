3236,"2015-07-04",4.2,"The beer is a light yellow, some gold. Medium white head. Foamy with a good bit of lacing. Big peach flavor in the aroma. Some vanilla. A touch of lacto. Some funk depth. Light to medium tart. Lightly bitter. Pretty big oak note, maybe a bit much. Not much rum but I can find it in background. Some more vanilla, a little spice. Light feel. Normal carbonation.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

3236,"2014-03-16",4.2,"Rating #2000!! I took my sweet time getting here but I needed a beer worthy of the occasion. What better choice than a 158-bottle private club release from my favorite brewery?

Always in Life pours a pleasant straw gold with a hazy aspect and fluffy eggnog-colored foam. Sticky sheets of lacing mark the glass as its tipped. The aroma is plushy, with unsweet macerated peaches and danjou pears softly melding with tart apple brandy and wet oak. Each new pour unleashes a strong Brettanomyces flourish, lightly phenolic along with notes of hay bales and grain sacks. The flavor is heavily bretty, with minerals and dried grass throughout. Beyond that, theres green apple, peach, pear skin, wheat, slight yogurt, unripe berries, and a grassy bretty finish. The palate is very soft due to a pillowy, fine carbonation. Theres a bit of tartness, but the brett is clearly outrunning any lacto at this stage. The ample strength is well-hidden. Nice stuff overall. 

Onto the next 2000...","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
3236,"2014-03-11",4.2,"SARAs Cellar Member-only brew #1  750ml bottle poured into a snifter glass. Aroma is funky. More of a yeasty kind of tropical funk and less so on the hay and barnyard. There is moderate amount of oak character with some sweet graininess, Belgian spice and moderate peachy fruit flesh. The fruit and funk work so well together, but this is definitely not a peach beer. Not sure where the rum character comes in, but maybe the sweeter aroma is some of the rum barrel. The beer pours cloudy pale yellow with huge, sticky, thick, soapy head. I dont know how SARA does it but, but all their bottled beers have the PERFECT head. Amazing lacing as the beer goes down. Flavor is up front Belgian spice, some yeast, really nice, but subtle peach character that turns into a sweet oaky character, light tropical fruit and slightly tart on the end. The body is medium, thick, a little creamy and fluffy with a lightly dry finish. The oak on the finish really comes out once you take a few more sips. The 10% is almost impossible to detect. No booziness or alcohol heat. The beers after taste is yeasty and peachy. Overall a really complex Belgian beer with moderate oak and really lovely peach and tropical brett character. The fruit didnt overpower the barrel, or the house microbes which really shined. Thanks Tim and Adair for the invite to a really special membership.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
3236,"2014-02-28",4.3,"Aroma has a very nice, fresh peach character to it. Light citrus notes and acidity. Light graininess, moderate barnyard funk and light oak notes. Nice Brett tropical fruitiness. 
Pours a cloudy, pale yellow gold with a moderately thick, medium sized fluffy white head that shows really good retention. Moderate lacing and smallish legs. 
Flavor has a nice moderate acidity with medium strong fresh peach character. Some light phenolic character, light barnyard funk and tropical fruit from Brett. Dry finish with medium bitterness. Finish has a moderate rum barrel character which contributes to the dryness. As your palate adjusts to the barrel character and acidity you pick up more and more preach juiciness. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with soft, medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall this is honestly an interesting and very complex beer. It starts light and acidic and a fruity Berliner Weiss. Mid palate it turns into a bigger Belgian style beer with some nice funk and fruitiness. The barrel adds another dimension to the finish and the rum contributes more fruit character. As it warms there is more fruit character, but still some light barrel notes. The alcohol is well hidden, the only real noticeable alcohol character is from the rum barrel.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Poured from a bottle and shared the day of release with friends at SARA.

A - This pours a hazy glowing light honey apricot with 2 finger fluffy head with sticky lacing. S - mmm. This is funky goodness. Eggy funk and strong yeasty goodness. A bit reminiscent of young Bernice. Nice peach and coconut notes as well. Funky, musty earthy and damp oak. A bit of acetic acid and rum notes on the end. M - medium body, with nice fluffy carb. malty thicker end with some nice rum heat to boot. T - Oooh! Peaches and egg funky goodness to start. Bernice like yeastines, lemon juice and zest follow nicely. Pineapple and light coconut notes follow. Light acetic notes, musty wet oak and nice warm rum end. O - another damn good beer from Sante. Would love to see how this matures, but alas! 4.2","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
