Taste is moderately sweet and aptly tart, nicely balanced and far from cloying. More applesauce and juicy apples. Lightly tannic. Body is medium and mouthfeel syrupy. Overall a very nice one that could certainly become a go to.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

Aroma is fantastic - apples, vanilla, oak, a touch of sharp glue (which Im sure is not actually glue), chocolate. Really nice. Taste is sweet, but not cloying like some ice wines. Theres a nice acidity as well. Syrupy palate. Overall a fantastic ice cider and Im glad I got to try it.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","northropfrye"
2409,"2015-11-11",5.0,"Bottle shared with northropfrye on Remembrance Day, 2015. Aroma: I can smell a sweet, strong oak aroma. Some floral and herbal notes, too. A rose-gold colour, which is very attractive. Taste is heavy sweetness, balanced by the oak barrel, which is a little bitter and herbaceous and then it burn/tickles just a little in the back at the end. I cant imagine a more perfect pomme de glace. Tres bien. Magnifique.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","dreamflower"
2409,"2014-10-17",4.8,"375 ml. bottle shared by Kraddel during the (Ice) Cider/Perry tasting @ Barely Legal Tasting Room. 2012 Vintage. Bottle nr. 6789. Thank you! Sampled. Gorgeous label. Tasted side-by-side with the non-BA version aka Verger St-Denis Pomme de Glace. Vintages were different. 2010 vs. 2012. Ice Cider doesnt change that much with aging I have been told. Pours way, way darker than non-BA version, dark caramel amber. Light sherry in the nose, warming syrup de Liège, lots of sugar, oak; Taste is sweet, warming, apple syrup, syrup de Liège, brown sugar, sherry. Thick, oily, nicely warming. Amazing on its own, I preferred the non-BA version which I felt had more nuances & this was more of a straight-forward flavour.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

Taste is sweet with caramelized apples, vanilla, wood, brown sugar, cinnamon, acidity, tropical fruits and a strong warming finish. Medium to full bodied. Liquorous, but really not as thick as the Ice Ciders from La Face Caché de la Pomme. Quite complex, but balanced could be a little better.

Sweet apple, hintsof cinnamon and very vinous. Pour was a nice clear amber. Taste is where this drink shines. Sweet crisp apple intermingle with pineapple, spice and coconut. Tastes like a sweet mixed carribean rum drink. Finish is sweet wet and long. Oak and vanilla in the aftertaste which mixes well with the sweet fruit. As it warmed some white grape came out.

Full syrupy body with a slight hint of alcohol heat and lotsof lingering sweet syrup left on your lips. The aroma is subdued with notes of older apples and a hint of oak. The flavor is so much better than the subtle aroma, lots of apples, light oak, sugar, green apple skins.

(8+) Flavour is mostly sweet sugars at first, fruit, apple note in the finish speaks heavily of skins. Perhaps an oaky earth note? tart apple undertones take their time arriving, but ultimately keep it from becoming cloying. Smooth medium to full bodied palate. (4+) Lovely stuff.

2409,"2007-11-25",4.0,"This pours from the bottle with an oily appearing deep golden hue. Legs are thick and cascade slowly downward. Medium high brix is evident. Alcohol is defiant even in its diminutive approach, about the same amount that is stated on the bottle is apparent. Complexity is modest, one or two apple varieties shining through. Mild caramelization and lighter oak with vanilla offers a sturdy backbone. Caramel is infiltrated by appleskin and soft undetermined spice. A cinnamon fire springs up late. The flavor is highly sweet but never overwhelming. Acidity is medium and likely softened by the barrel slumber. Earthiness sneaks through in the finish, presumably from oak aging. Zero oxidation and no flaws noted. Tannic acidity is a minor distraction. The body is slick and full, smooth. The finish is very exciting and expansive across the palate. This is one to share with many friends, a little goes a long, long way. Not particularly memorable but very drinkable and enjoyable whilst consumption ensues.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
2409,"2007-11-23",4.1,"Courtesy Dickinsonbeer.  Pours still, with a golden-honey colored body.  A quick swirl shows thick, syrupy legs.  The aroma is pure, fresh, reduced apple juice.  Nothing more, nothing less.  The flavor is the same....just thick, chewy apples, straight from the tree to the press, with perhaps just a dusting of dark spice.  Highly concentrated.  Thick, full, oily mouthfeel.  Smooth.  This cider is very straightforward and simple, but that is part of its genius.  Very well executed ice cider.  Awesome dessert beverage.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Aroma of thick sweet reduced apple juice and cider, light tartness of green apple and apple skin with a nice woody oak character , some vanilla and almost some cedar hints.  Syrupy sweet apple flavor, green apple tartnes in the end, but the middle is filled with apple pie, sugary, and oaky to cut the sweetness.  I thought this one was about as good as the Eternelle from La Face Cachee.  Awesome stuff!!!","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
2409,"2007-01-23",3.9,"Maybe a notch darker in its golden tones than the regular ice cider, this is a rather exquisite ice cider which does just take a bit of the barrel character to impart it to the already pretty good basic St-Denis Pomme de Glace. We therefore have all the typical right applesauce goodness where soft woody tannins penetrate to complexify the matters. No notable oxidation. The acidity level is comforting, balancing a bit the concentrated fruits which head a bit toward mandarin and peach nuances on top of the apples. A fine drink.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
