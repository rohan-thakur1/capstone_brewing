Clearly discernible idea, some off-flavours frustrate a better result.","Bielefeld, GERMANY","Idiosynkrasie"

2175,"2016-07-07",3.6,"Many thanks to rosenbergh for this bottle, 9.5%ABV! Nose of dry sweet malt, malt-candy. The beer starts fresh and aromatic, round and sweetish with a nice spicy-herbal aroma in the body. Spice, caramel, fruity hints. Very interesting and highly drinkable with a warming alcohol in the back. The carbonation level is very low, fresh and fruity, moderate bitter with lots of dry-burned caramel in the aftertaste.","Wuppertal, GERMANY","Erzengel"

2175,"2014-12-11",2.7,"330 ml bottle (9.5%) @ Maja/Talo Tampere
Orange-brown clear beer with no head. Turns murky when you pour the yeast. Aroma has sweet ripe banana, vanilla and light juniper. Flavor is dry and sour with heavy juniper, with some banana and other fruitiness on the side. Palate is quite full and soft. Finish is dry and sour with lots of juniper. Aroma was nice but the flavor is really unrefreshing and untasty, not really pleasant to drink the whole bottle.","Tampere, FINLAND","Andy_"
2175,"2014-11-13",3.2,"Bottle from rosenbergh. Thanks Jan! Pours an amber color with almost no head. Caramel, spice, juniper, slight leather aromas. Sweet malts, bananas, cardboard, caramel flavors. Minimal carbonation. Doesnt feel at all like a 9% beer, actually kind of light-medium bodied with no alcohol in the flavor. Very interesting beer.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","jcnielsen"

Amber brown muddy. Juniper, ripe banana esters, but also some slight crunchy amber maltyness in the aroma. Not nearly as banana-ized as sahti usually, and theres also quite a bit of leafy herbals. Hops, I presume. Full body. Dry, a bit bitter. Some roastedness. Leafyness. Bisquity malts. Yeast. Feels like ale yeast. Weird flavoured dry barley wine. Not a total loss though. Has some sahti flavs there, deep somewhere.","FINLAND","jookos"

This way proteins are treated little bit differently. Kataja is very drinkable and less cloudy. Brewed for restaurants (longer shelf age).

Pours hazy dark orange color with no head, not as murky as sahti usually is. Aroma is somewhat pleasant with sweet caramel, mild yeast and sweet banana esthers. Flavour is also sweetish with ripe fruits, not overly sweet though, some juniper and yeast can be found also, distant herbs and spices on the finish. No carbonation, slick and somewhat oily sweet palate. Alcohol stays on the background. A positive surprise.

2175,"2013-08-02",3.2,"Draught (9,5%) @ Bar 101 beers
Bright apperarance, no head, looks like filtered. Sweetish and a bit stale aroma with banana esthers, some yeasty notes and hints of hay. Flavour is sweetish and slightly floury with banana esthers, some yeasty notes and hints of tart grapefruit. Leathery and dry finish with woody notes and some alcohol, that becomes a bit disturbing after some sips. Juniper starts to linger in my mouth at the middle of the glass. No noticeable off-flavours. A bit straightforward and the juniper is too strong, but a decent sahti anyway.","Tampere, FINLAND","laiti"
