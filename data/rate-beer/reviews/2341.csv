It took me awhile to figure out, but this really reminds me of a really barnyardy cheese that is difficult to enjoy for someone who isnt ready for it. Gorgonzola also comes to mind.

There is a balancing spice of coriander and light pepper. The sweetness is a blend of earthy Belgian tones, candied malt and hops that taste like wildflowers. Hats off to Southampton for this one.

Pours a bright, hazy brownish orange that is vibrant orange when held up to the light.  The massive white fluffy head lasts forever and lingers as a one-inch cap that leaves lots of lacing on the way down.

Initial aroma is massive citrus with oranges and lemons on top of a sweet Belgian yeast background.  There are also tons of spices, with the coriander especiallly evident.  I cant really place the anise in the nose.

The taste is a tad sweeter than the aroma and starts with a big candi sugar sweetness and plenty of fruit sweetness, both light fruits like apples and darker fruits such as raisins.  The coriander comes back strong in the finish wtih an earthy spiciness that lingers for a while.

The mouthfeel is very smooth with lots of carbonation and a great balance of sticky sweetness and spiciness on the palate.

Half Time Beverage

This beer has been sitting in the cellar for about a year and a half now. Southamptons Grand Cru pours a semi-translucent sunset orange that has some shimmer out of the bottle but glows when backlit. A standard pour brought about a fat two finger white head that fell rather quickly to one finger and left big chunky sheet lacing on its way down, even after every drink. The carbonation can be seen rushing up from every surface of the glass and keeps the head sticking around for the entirety. 

The nose of this beer is absolutely laden with spiciness. Its tough for me to even put my finger on the complexities of this beer. Theres a muddled mixture of spices right off the bat but they quickly start to separate and become more pronounced. Vanillin is quickly met by sweet orange peel, another citric aspect along the lines of coriander, and a mild touch of anise. Candi sugar and the pale maltiness add a sweetness thats welcomed and the hops add a bit of herbal earthiness. Im torn between giving this a 4 or a 4.5. I have to go with the lower of the two because of some of the muddled aromas up front.

I wasnt all that crazy with this beer at first but as it warms more and more the flavors come together much better. A faint hint of vanilla passes by quickly before the sweet orange peel comes back into play. The most noticeable spice in the flavor is the coriander. The coriander is big, juicy and explosive with a great citric character. Theres a touch of sweetness left behind from the candi sugar and pale maltiness that add a great depth to the already complex flavor. A sweet caramel and brown sugar maltiness coe through as well. The spices that were added in this beer make it a true treat. The hop additions, although Im sure they have faded over time, are in the back and slightly herbal and earthy. This beer really is a treat.

The mouthfeel has a little more body than I would have liked to see. There is a little sugary sweetness that contributes to the body being on the heavy side of medium although it never gets in the way. The carbonation adds a nice soothing mouthfeel and the spices leave behind a bit of tingle.

This really is a treat to put away but it is without a doubt a sipper. The spice complexities keep this from going down too quickly but also make this beer what it is. This is something to sip and savor the night away.

This so far is the best beer I have had from Southampton. I wasnt that impressed at first but it continues to get better as it warms. The mouthfeel, spiciness, and warmth set this apart from others of a similar style but as I drink I keep wanting more and more. This is actually an excellent beer that I would love to pick up more of.

2005 Vintage.  This is the bottle that is pictured and was brewed and bottled at the Publick House brewpub.  Pour is cloudy, sediment filled orange ruby with no head whatsoever. Aroma of rounded caramel, big sweet cane sugar sweetness. Full, very pretty nose.  Cidery bite. Taste is the caramel maltiness with bright ginger and coriander. Finish is grassy, long earthiness. Nice, though, perhaps a bit past prime. Palate is long and mouth coating. (9,3,7,4,16 - 3.9)

2341,"2008-10-06",4.1,"Thanks bmartin. Pours a golden orange with a one finger creamy off white head. Upon opening it seems as though this bottle will have little carbonation. The nose is spicy, nice earthiness to it, Belgian influence comes through in a very nice way, sweet, citrusy, orange peel definitely shows. The flavor is sweet, oranges for sure, spicy, alcohol well hidden, earthy Belgian funk, . Very nice full lively carbonation despite the seeming lack of carbonation on the pour and opening of the bottle. Finishes spicy and funky, a fantastic ""Belgian"". 

I like the upfront character of the Belgian yeast and how it coordinates with the use of orange peel. Creates a very tasty traditional Belgian feel rather than an American interpretation.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"

Appearance is a murky light orange hue, head is a large layer of big foamy bubbles that gradually erode down.

Smell is sugary sweet malts with a range of spices and fruits including bananas, cloves, licorice, coriander, light peach syrup, figs/raisins, berries, some belgian yeast lurks throughout.

Taste too is a range of fruits and spices, initially dominated by light orange, bananas, peaches, and berries, some darker fruits and spices (coriander, cinnamon) pop up midway, the anise is light throughout and the finish is syrupy sweet.

Mouthfeel is medium/full-bodied, thick chewy texture borders on syrupy sweet, carbonation is moderate.

A decent amount of candied seville oranges shine through, which is kind of becoming a staple of some Southampton brews I find.  Nice, big, juicy flavors, but pretty sweet and just a thin mouthfeel.  Some creaminess could really help this beer.  More pleasant nuances begin to unfold toward the bottom of the bottle, as is custom with Southampton.  Delightful floral notes play with the candied orange.    Kind of reminiscent of the Cuvee des Fleurs when the yeast mixes in.

2341,"2008-08-04",3.0,"UPDATED: AUG 5, 2008 Bottle, aged over 1 year.  Pours a medium-dark golden orange color, mostly clear, but with some very fine floating particulate.  The head dissipates so quickly, I could barely get a glimpse of its tan hue.  Whats left is a completely smooth, syrupy looking body that leaves thick, sugary legging on the glass after a swirl.  The aroma is massively sweet and boozy, heavy of golden raisons, candied orange peels, Cointreau, citrus blossom honey, and just a touch of coriander for bitterness.  As sweet as it smells, the flavor just takes it up level to borderline liquid candy status.  Golden raisons pureed with honey comes to mind.  Spicy, floral hops attempt to balance things out, but wind up getting crushed by the saccharine intensity.  Thick and sugary in the mouth, with little carbonation, it almost drinks like a low ABV mead.  This one is over the top sweet, even after a year of cellaring.

When poured in a flute, the head occupied more than half the glass.  The body of the beer was clear and golden to orange in color.  The aroma of the beer was like a spice cake, with oranges, clove, rum raisins, and sherry smells.  The taste was cake like as well because of the sweet bready and airy malt  backbone with all of the flavors I was smelling embedded within.  Since a Grand Cru is generally served at weddings, the cake character was apropos.  The alcohol provided a bitter, ethereal, drying counterpoint to this flavor.

2341,"2008-05-01",4.1,"As reviewed on 12/12/06.

750ml corked and caged bottle from ""Southampton bottling, Royersford, Pa"".

Pours hazy gold with orangy hues, and a dense, creamy, half-inch head of off-white.
Some pretty decent lacework reveals itself as the head falls to partial coverage on the surface.
Aromatics are something to behold. Almost pungent in quantity, but not overbearing.
Citrus-laden and spicy, with notes of orange zest, white pepper, grape bubblegum, coriander, and Grand Marnier.
The nose finishes warming and inviting, with lingering fruit.
Body is lightish and effervescent, a bit spritzy and lively. Great for the style.
Pallet is extremely fruity, with spicing playing a supporting role. 
Bitterness is firm, and nods to some heavy-handed hop additions at the beginning of the boil.
Orangy and lightly boozy, with some bright, coriander citrus notes, and plenty of clovey phenols. 
Plenty of alcoholic warmth, but no heat, underneath some very light malt character.
Finishes spicey and a bit sharp on the tongue, with a nice rounded honey note.
I dont know if these contract brewed bottles are bottle conditioned or pasturized, but Ill bet that a year or two in the cellar would up the numbers even more.

Revisit-vintage 2006
Pours orangy gold with a massive four-inch head of airy sponge. Retention is of a several minute duration, with plenty of smears and webbing of lace.

Aromatics are much more subdued, but plenty of saison-like earthyness, dried grass, orange marmalade, and pepper-studded honey.

Mouthfeel is medium, sticky, and a notch below lively.

Orange blossom honey, grape jam, Grand Marnier, and juicy citrus on the pallet. A substantial, drying bitterness fades as the glass goes.
Warming and still sweetish. 
Finishes with some lingering, slick honey, tropical citrus, and a hint of lemon zest.

Wowza, two years and improving on what was already a remarkable beer.
Ill have to bury the next one.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","brewandbbq"

Clear amber color with a multifinger beige head. Near full bodied with creamy carbonation. Flavors are multiple. Citrus peel, likely coriander, but I think the candi is hiding the liquorice. All kinds of fruit like peaches, apricots and plums. Nothing really dark. Theres some hot spice in the finish, and then theres some heat down the throat.

2341,"2007-12-20",4.9,"Gorgeously dulled in tone in a pure shade of coppery orange jelly with a active core that keeps a lava lamp of activity along the sides of the goblet. A perfect, nearly gelantinous, thick, tall, creamy substance of a head sits with a firm, steady, lathering of yellowish foam that insists on not moving until touched by the lips. Lacing is big and drippy in large sheetings across the glass.

Nose is quite fair and round with a fine yeasty spice of white pepper and corriander. Perhaps a flinting of ginger. Moderately malty and kinda candyish with some soft pineapple and tangerine along with some bubblegum esters.

Taste is wonderfully rounded in malty richness of thick, deep, and dulled, tropical-like candy chewyness smacked with the perfect touch of fun spicy notes that really balance well. Actually, this is quite superbly balanced! A totally perfect melange of tamed, but huge malty goodness that reflects all that is thick and candy, toffee rich. Much like a fresh, and softly, slow baked bread and some bubblegum. And the spices that are added in are terrifically interwoven into the composition with a craft and care that endures wonderment and tasty awe. Its a bit hard to pin it down exactly; the spice is a tad peppery, yeasty of course, and a feathery tad citric as well. Especially as it trails off into the finish as theres a small little oompf of pithy bittering lemony/orange bite. Exacting the finish with length thats strong with malt and drying late with some yeast, citric hops, and a malty reign of candyied chewy leftovers. Awesomely Yummy!

Huge, chewy, malt body that brings a large and in charge candied impression of bubblegum ascented with tropical fruits. At first it didnt seem as full, but as it went along this got bigger and bigger, fuller and fuller. Is that even possible. Well, if not, than this just proved the impossible Cuz this just plain out was huge and chewy with a very favorable smoothness and a pleasingly dulled sense of commonality and balance that screamed ""Drink me you fool, drink me!""

...And so I did, and then some. Wow, an amazing brew! Way better from what I remember from when I first had it a couple summers ago. Totally worth every penny and every sip you can get. Phenomenal stuff! And a pure gem by Southampton!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Flavor is tangy and sweet when it is colder. But when it is warmer, it presents a spiced strong ale. The spices peek out much more than the tang or the sugar when it is cold. Feel has a lot of bubble on the mouth, but a thicker liquid feel with a slightly slimy type of character. I know that is a weird word to use, but to me that is what it is. It is not syrupy, but it does have a different type of texture to the fluid. Overall, drinkability is high. Its a bit too tangy in my opinion, but its still another good production from Southampton.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","RblWthACoz"

Pour was a beautiful orange with a 2 finger puffy off white head. Taste was extremely spicy and sticky. Orange peel and coriander mostly. Anise makes an appearance in the aftertaste and after warming up almost a black licorice taste which will make me gag if it continues. Most notably is the peppery feel and taste. It almost burns the mouth (in a different way than the strong alcohol burn). The spiciness and pepper-ness were a little overdone, but this is better than the standard sugar water tasting Belgian strongs.","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"

Taste is as puzzling as the nose.  Over ripe peaches and plums, dried apricot and orange zest.  Carb is there but its not.  Feels syrupy but stays drinkable.

Theres a mild suggestion of wet cardboard oxidation underneath.  Hints of rain soaked maple, prickly, sour champagne, and medicinal leanings.  Seriously heavy yeast.

A good hint of spices, ranging from light citrus to herbal anise.  A little belgian funk, but very slight.  The mouthfeel was a bit heavy, lowish carbonation, though still light enough to drink.  The alcohol is not just hidden, but altogether appropriate, cutting this thickish beer well.  Big and sweet and round, with substantial fruitiness.  In many ways, this reminds me of the different between Rodenbach and Rodenbach Grand Cru.  The fruit really lingers on the palate, though the sweetness becomes rather dry.

Pours with a slight off-white, egg-shell head that quickly dissappates.  A weird funkiness pervades the tastes.  The aroma is of coriander and star anise- aka, peppery and orangy.  Not as malty as I thought it would be.  This is definitely a spiced ale. Slight orange rind in the mouthfeel and aftertaste along with the peppery anise.  Very interesting.

Aroma of sweet caramel malt, soft sweet spice, lemon zest - oddly caramelized, like burnt candy.  Taste - very nice - up front I got a lot of anise, wish sweet malt and spice, but as it warmed it became increasingly appealing, with candied orange peel and tangerine zest blending with light spice bitterness to make for a nice sweet finish, only very moderately alcoholic (although I started to feel it a little later).  The mouthfeel was of watered down syrup, silky and a bit sticky but a touch watery (like it were on tap, not bottled) - quite acceptable carbonation, not a long finish, but a pleasant sweet and spicy linger - very well done, yet I have to say I enjoyed the Saison Deluxe a bit more, although this one went down easier!","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

Poured a good looking reddish burnt orange with a frothy, foamy white head, decent retention, small amount of laced sticking.

Aromas of mushy, bready yeast, coriander and orange peel, peach and tropical fruits, Belgian spices, seedy and herbal, lightly floral and a whiffs of alcohol at the edges.

Good, steady carbonation and a crisp, dry, textured, creamy smooth, airy medium bodied mouthfeel.

This is a great tasting Grand Cru, balanced and delicious, mushy, musty bread-like yeast, coriander and seedy spices, herbs, orange peel with hints of rind, peaches, tropical fruits with a light squeeze of lemon, a little licorice, peppery alcohol that is warming in the back of the palate, the hops provides a nice soft bitterness towards the end, and a dry, peppery, yeasty, malty finish.

Poured hazy and orange, with a very minimal head.  Lots of floaties in there.  Very yeasty and spicy in the nose.  Flavor was not what I was expecting.  Very tart, almost like a cider, and lots of orange.  Sometimes its sweet, then its tart, with subtle spices the whole way and no trace of alcohol.

Before I even raise the glass to my nose I smell the coriander. After warming a bit, the coriander recedes, and other aromas come forth - yeasty for sure, with some orange zest and, um, celery? Alcohol is also noticed, with some light caramel and licorice. Beautiful spiderweb lace. Bold, spicy-sweet flavor, bitter orange leads the way, followed by something like a brandied peach. Spicy and yeasty. Alcohol shows in the flavor, but more in the finish, which is a mildly spicy bitter, and the celery flavor peeks out at the very end.

Dunno if star anise is supposed to smell like black licorice like regular anise, but I dont get it here.  I also got a bit of (spear)mint after a few minutes.  The flavor has some candied brown sugar and plums up front--quite sweet--with some sweet oranges making an appearance as well.  A fair amount of spices, white pepper,  and banana-y fruity esters also being apparent, though this beer does taste a bit darker than it looks.

In long: Smell of spicy orange.  Superb rich and lively body.  Very sweet.  Lightly to moderately spicy with a complex but mellow mix of herbal and mineral spices.  Fruity taste is dominated by concentrated apple juice, oranges with some grapefruit.  Quite a bit of hard candies.  Warming alcohol presence (not well hidden).

nose starts very yeasty/doughy while cold, and as it warms the spices come out with a sticky malty toastiness. further warming puts a bit of butter into play - normally a downer for me, but it is not over-bearing, and it goes nicely with the spice.

balanced flavor starts with a restrained sweetness ,and dries and puckers a bit from the combined bitterness of the hops and spices, particularly some zest bite from the bitter orange.

2341,"2006-11-08",4.2,"Despite being hidden in my dark closet Southamptons Grand Cru traveled a roller coaster of expectations, varying from utter excitement to a worrisome prospect, affected by praising and terrifying reviews alike, shifting to new brewing grounds and methods - I was simply confused. It was concluded that the brew I drank was the most recent iteration, produced at Sly Fox.


As light shines through its apricot hue a bucolic mist develops under fluffy off-white clouds. The scene reminds of my summer travels through Flanders, a mellow glow flooding the horizon. The aroma immediately strikes as eminently Belgian, in fact I dare say Ive never experienced such a cogent imitation from American brewers. Its a delicate combination of sweet and spicy, rich and buttery; complex fragrances and flavors that compose a true symphony. Esters are accentuated in Southamptons interpretation, showing plenty of Bazooka Joe, banana, pineapple but also buttery wheat, yogurt, brown sugar and light caramel malts. Sweet clementine and apricot, a hint of tulip and vanilla, coriander and nutmeg, every nuance adds to the unity of this wonderful nose. Like a post-impressionist painting the flavor surprises with dabs of unexpected color, bursting initially with a creamy orange peel only to flow directly into a more vivacious nutmeg and cinnamon tone. The palate continues to evolve developing buttery caramel before it collapses onto lasting anise and gin. This ale speaks for itself, and with brio I might add.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Plenty of racing spices and fruits on the palate--cherries, green apples, coriander, banana, clove, caramel. Could have been a train wreck but instead its spectacular.

Not as much of the orangey notes carried over into the flavor, but this is still a great tasting beer.  Mouthfeel is nice, but a little oily and hugely carbonated.  This is a nice beer, but the sweetness of the orange and the spices are a little overpowering, and maybe compete with each other a little too much.  Definitely my favorite Southampton to date.

2341,"2006-07-08",3.6,"Scared me a bit; the cork came out with no sound at all from a bottle full to bursting. The pour however, was a relief: beautiful amber with a huge, soft white head and plenty of effervescence. Coriander-dominated aroma not unlike that of a good Witbier. Theres something else in the mix, too: a bit of alcohol, a pungent strain of Belgian yeast, and various other spices, esters, and similar aroma producers. Theres more alcohol in the flavor, where it dries out an excellent, Belgian-infused sweet apple, peach, and candy sugar taste. The coriander isnt as pronounced as it was in the aroma, which is a good thing. Citrusy, somewhat hot finish. As it warms, the alcohol takes over; in a beer like this, theres no way for the alcohol to mix well with the other flavors. Still, good stuff.","Winchester, Virginia, USA","jmuhops"

2341,"2006-06-30",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2008 750 cork & wire.  2006 bottle, the new ones Southampton makes out of the Sly Fox facility in PA.  Consumed very fresh. Pours an orange-ish copper color, pretty clear beer with a small head.   Aroma is strong - a strong sweetness with a floral background.  Mouthfeel is perfect.  Flavor is also sweet and floral, slight citric/coriander feel - not as present as the label makes you think.  Mouthfeel is great, perfect for this beer; heavy body, real pillow-y feel.  Carbonation is felt right at the back of the throat.  Leaves a citric sting with a floral sweetness aftertaste.
Vertical of 2005 Publick House bottling (pictured) and 2006 Sly Fox bottled versions. The 05 has some very sweet cardboard and some cork aspects.  While the SH yeast is turning just a bit sour.  But overall still aging very nicely.  Lots of marmalade-like syrupy flavors.  Some fruit and a bread-y, grainy finish.  The yeast is keeping things cool and the spices are still lightly there.  The 06 is doing great thought.  Much thicker, lively maltiness in there with spices still kicking strong.  Taste is doughy yeast, lots of the anise and the other spices.  Not showing any negative signs of age.  Very impressive version of the beer coming from a Sly Fox.  I would say I prefer the 06 contracted version but so many things are uneven.  Limitations: green bottle for the Publick House version, spent more time on store self before I got it, and obviously there is a year difference on the bottles.Final thoughts: definitely get the Sly Fox version and feel free to age it, it changes in a good way.  The 05 Publick House while still good should maybe not sit around any longer (but again my bottle was not optimal).","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

Pours a hazy orangish amber color and is topped by a frothy light tan colored head.  The beer is well carbonated as well, and I would almost expect a bit more of a head at this level of carbonation.  The aroma has a woody component to it (remnants of the cork), as well as a slight acidity, notes of pear and tart apple.  The aroma is quite earthy as well, with hints of musty clay, perhaps a bit of a musty note, and an underlying spiciness that I would describe as earthy as well.  As my notes gets used to the aroma a sweetness begins to pick up a bit; it mostly accentuates the fruitiness a bit more, but highlights a bit of maltiness.  The alcohol in the finish starts to become noticeable as well, with a bit of hotness to it as well, though only a hint.

The beer has a soft, almost creamy mouthfeel to it.  I like how this beer is quite life and quaffable, though watch out as the alcohol will definitely sneak up on you, despite the other flavor notes.  The beer is quite a bit sweeter than I was expecting from the aroma, but is quite inline with what I was expecting before  trying this beer.  The sweetness really accentuates the fruit character; notes of sweet plums are prominent, but I also get notes of raisins, pear, and Macintosh.  The finish is spicy with an earthy note as well as a lightly astringent spice note, which provides some bitter balance to the upfront fruity sweetness.

I am not quite too sure what I was expecting from this beer, but it is quite a nice end to an Christmas day of overeating and stuffing myself.  This beer has a certain richness to it (in both the sweetness and the earthy spiciness) that is quite nice and fulfilling.  There is a hint of tartness to this beer, and if there is one complaint it is that this beer could use a bit more tartness; the level provided by some aged Fantomes would be classic.  This beer is quite enjoyable, though I was perhaps expecting a bit more complexity and depth here.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Many thanks to Larry (goldtwins) for providing me with beer #1000!  Amber/light copper body, slightly hazy, thin off-white head.  Lots of white grape and apple in the aroma as well as a touch of plum, orange, sweet breads and crackers.  Yeasty mustiness in the background.  Flavor was very sweet with plenty of candi sugar, apple, white grape, coriander, and spicy yeast esters, with a touch of prune and caramel at the finish.  Reminded me a bit of those 8 oz fruit juice cartons that were popular lunch-time items in elementary school.  Biscuity finish with hints of alcohol.  The sweetness was unbalanced and a bit cloying; I find that beers this sweet are best when the sugars are balanced by chocolate and/or dark fruit character.  Full-bodied and dense.  A good beer, but not one of the best Ive sampled.  One thousand down; how many to go?","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

Lightly cloudy dark golden color, with a thick, lasting cap of foam and a dense web of lace.  Flavor profile is sweet and sugary to start, becoming fruity, citric and tart before a long, complex, lightly warming, spicy and juicy finish with a hint of white grape and freshly cut wood appearing late.

Theres plenty of spices (cloves) sweetish body, but it doesnt get too much theres sufficient citric (orangey) hop presence to set them off.

For some reason I always have interesting experiences on these milestone beers.  Despite breaking this stubborn one in half, I managed to extract the stump with my trusty waiters tool.  Poured a lightly hazy light amber color with a gorgeous pillow white head that lasted throughout.  The light color, however, was in no way indicitive of the massive amounts of complexity packed into this brew.  Huge nose of orange marmalade, wood, yeast, and dark fruits.  Flavor is composed of slightly sour blackberries, blood oranges, anise, oak, and hyacinths.  Layers of complexity that I cannot begin to do justice to in this description.  Perfect mouthfeel.  This was absolutely stunning, worthy of its place in the top 50, and a memorable milestone beer.  Wow.  NOTE:  This rated version was from the Southampton bottling.  The PA bottling, while still excellent, lacks some of the complexity, most notably lacking the depth of dark fruit characters.  This is more reminiscent of the Hoegaarden Grand Cru.

As this brew warmed the fruitiness stepped back a bit and let the sweetness show through a bit more. Great citrus fruits show through with a nice spice finish. Some nice dried out older hops finished this brew off with just the lightest bitterness.

2341,"2004-11-19",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 10, 2005 2004 bottle generous compliments of bucknaked who definitely didnt have to open this (would have benefited from aging).  That being said, yes, it was a bit malty and sweet.  If there were any gripes on the balance that would be it.  But it was minor and knowing that it would even out over time, Im not going to fault it.  The spiciness and light light hops provide the balance on the end.  As it breathes, the citrus notes become quite apparent towards the end.  I would have guessed coriander and grains of paradise, but am not too far off.  The pepper is light and wonderfully  interesting.  Throughout, there is a good, but delicate dose of yeast, adding that lovely wet old wood flavor.  The aroma smells like the cork, woody, yeasty, slightly moldy with notes of coriander.  Appearance is perfect, burnished orange-copper, with layered colors (gold, orange, yellow) and a foamy white head and plenty of lacing.  Bottle conditioned and nearly opaque.  Palate is sumptuously balanced and creamy.  Light natural carbonation, the good stuff, adds a lovely light pepperiness.  Delicate, distinctly belgian and full of yeast.  ALcohol is barely perceptible, though there is a strangely stale alcohol note on the very end. 8/5/9/5/192002 bottle @ the DCVAMD Gathering compliments of Jeremy.  Much funkier, sweeter, more malt than spice (not surprising) but just has a weird lacto-old cork funk to it that really permeates the palate, musty and strong.  Yeast, cobwebs, wow, this stuff is quite different than the 2004 (8/5/8/4/17)2005 bottle sampled 7/9/2005.  Much different than the previous two releases.  Its interesting that most everyone who has tried the previous vintages does not seem to like this one as much, but for those having never tried the 04 or 02 (or earlier), they find this quite good.  I really think its just how different it is, with the almost syrupy, sweet malt and different mouthfeel to it (thicker and bigger bubbles, looser carbonation).  I cant help but desire the older, perfumier, drier, elegant version, but this is still a great beer.  In fact, this one should have better luck with extended aging, I should think. 8/4/8/4/16  Score is an average of the 3.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2341,"2004-10-11",4.2,"10/9/04.  Poured out of 750 mL bottle, obtained in a trade with Eyedrinkale from RateBeer 9/23/04.  Pours a pale, hazy orange color with a thin cream-white head.  I love the color, but this beer absolutely NEEDS a fluffy, lasting Duvel-like head with some Brussels lace.  Itd make the whole experience of drinking it so much more gratifying.  I see many notes on here about the great appearance (and head), and I really cant explain it.  Mine was weak.  It was more fizzy than fluffy.  Aroma, on the other hand, is light and fluffy, fruity with a light cotton mustiness.  Fruits of pineapple and citrus, some strange estery notes that I dont even think Ive ever smelled before.  Really lovely.  Taste is lightly sour and again very ""fluffy.""  Some doughiness and fruit, as well as an ever-so-slight funky tartness.  Subtle and elegant, but I think it could use more depth.  Nice spice, but the finish especially seems a little bit too faint for me.  I look forward to trying this one again in another sample to see if I stil agree with these first impressions, but in trying this next to other elegant and sophisticated Belgians and American Belgian-styles (like Cuvee de Tomme, Le Woody, and Stille Nacht Reserva), this is sadly lacking all-around.  Still quite lovely, to be fair, and its subtlety is both its greatest strength AND its greatest weakness.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

Hey, Ive still got half a bottle left to complete my thoughts with, though some time must be spent merely lifting my soul from the normal sphere of the ordinary into realms of the sublime, relaxing in my mind along unexplored rivers of the imaginary universe, sending the mind into places unbespoke, not normally navigated until an elixir like this breaks the spell that confines us all into the normal cages of the physical plane...that sort of stuff.

2341,"2004-08-29",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2010 Cloudy amber, light and sticky off-white head is very nice for the strenght. Unique malty aroma of orange, toasted malt, grahma cookies, plain oat, coriander, bread dough yeast, curacao etc. Very interesting although Id have hoped for more intensity. Nice complex belgian style palate, peppery, mostly dry. Faint creamy lactic component. Curacao leads to a pleasant fruity bitterness. Light grapefruit lingers for a while in the superb aftertaste. Very yeasty yet even more balanced. Usual Southampton creamy mouthfeel, full bodied, extremely smooth despite the rather high carbonation. Nice beer, sure thing. </br> Resample: Doesnt taste like its made in America. Incredible complexity. All in subtleties, new discoveries every sip like a layer of dust going away to uncover a mysterious treasure. Foresty, hoppy, orangey lemonade. Perfect mouthfeel with smooth belgian high carbonation. Tartness, sweetness, bitterness, it has it all. A land where every component respects each other, no trace of overdoing which is a beauty nowadays. I love it, raising the score from 4.4 to 4.7. World-Class. Well, it had changed in the last few years. Some batches were disappointments, but others remain outstanding. Even these latters feel a bit less than the enormously complex renditions from the Publick Houses old 750s. Lowering from 4.7 to 4.3.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Murky orange body topped by a beautiful dense, light tan head that has decent staying power and leaves behind some wonderful lacing. The aroma is citrus up front, along with coriander, light musty yeast, and flowery hops to round things out. The flavor is very citrusy at first then the citrus mellows and I get a big burst of peach and coriander.  Sweetness up front then some a bit of tang followed by a nip of alcohol warming. Lively dry palate and medium bodied.  This is a hell of a beer, however given the class of its competition I think it falls short of brilliant. A bit over spiced.

Mildly spicey and citrusy, melons, more fruityness. Good malt backbone, caramelly, buttery with refined black pepper notes. This is a full, rather complex brew with a lightly sweet finish.

2341,"2004-04-29",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 24, 2012 (2003 and 2004 vintages) : In the wealthiest barnyard has been extruded this wild pear diamond from the earth sitting beneath a multi-karat haystack...Carefully polished by the kaleidoscope of rustic fruitiness emanating from the bière de gardish malt, this classy and complex jewel simply has no rough edges and elevates the funk of Moneuse/Fantôme to the firmament of Trappists...Crunchy, sumptuous malt biscuits and fat oranges shine brightly for all to see...And the voice of a serene hop soprano sends its divine light to that of the elements...10/4/10/4  18/20

(2005 vintage) : Its not completely flat, but extremely low carbonation. But thats not what disappointed me the most. Its the total absence of biscuity malt to match the gorgeous spice perfume which inhabits this beer. Yes, its young, so the alcohol is more prominent and is dissociated from the rest of the beer, but that malt biscuit I loved so much within the spices, has disappeared. Shit. Just a major disappointment all around, even though the beer is still pretty enjoyable. Just nowhere near the previous vintages...Its tart finish, and strong orange personification is highly intriguing, but its not at all up to the same standards. A strange creature. 9/3/7/4  14/20

A recent batch bottled at Sly Fox almost has the Grand Cru back to what it was...The biscuity maltiness isnt as expressive, but all spices are accurately laid out, and very enticing (star anise being a stand out)...A few months on this one, and it might flourish and become grandiose like I know it can be...Bravo Southampton! 4.0/5","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

Virtually no head.

Took forever to get the frickin cork out, which required both a pair of pliers as well as a corkscrew (which broke in the process!).  Most difficult cork extraction of my entire life thus far, including dry corks that disintegrated.  The ridiculous part is that when it finally emerged, there was hardly a pop at all.

Bottle #1:Alright, here it is...rating number 500! I picked this one because every ranking aside from Silky was above a 4.0 and as soon as I enter my rating, it becomes a top 50 beer! 750 mL bottle, Orange label, cellar temperature. Crystal clear amber colour with hints of orange. A perfect frothy white head leaves the most exceptional lacing on the glass i've ever seen. Zillions of small bubbles rising from the bottom are very nice. When pouring the beer, bubbles come from the neck of the bottle, appearing similarly when pouring champagne. Smells of yeast, sugar, bread, spices and some alcohol. Very nice smelling, but I don't consider it to be perfect. Full-bodied; Yeastie, sugary, spicey (coriander perhaps, definately curacao--orange peel) and a bit of caramel (burnt sugar). A great mouthful, very pleasant taste and a sweet aftertaste, with lingering spices and somewhat yeastie. Truly a bottle that everyone should try! One of the best beers I've had in a long time, and very happy that it was #500 for me! I bought my 750 mL bottle at Beers of the World in Rochester, New York.

2341,"2003-08-15",4.4,"A very nice subdued orangish caramel bronze, with a small amount of head.  Has an aroma of angel food frosting and bannana bread.  Tastes like a brown sugar covered yam. what else can I say its really simple to describe for me and its really fuckin good.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"
2341,"2003-07-22",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 24, 2005 [rating adjustment - the last few vintages of this (2004-05) have been far more dry, tart, and cider-like, with distinct white wine characteristics - theyve been good, but hardly worth my previous rating of 4.8] This beer is bloody brilliant - I must go along with Uglyradio and say this is the best american-made belgian Ive ever had - yeasty, grassy, spicy aroma....very inviting - excellent lacing on the glass - the flavor is spicy to start, with the anise quite present, but then a subdued, wonderful, birthday cake-like sweetness rolls onto the tongue, striking a perfect balance with the spice and slight citrus qualities - sweetness stays on in the finish, but doesnt over stay its welcome...it slowly melts away, making you long for another sip - another outstanding beer from Southampton.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
2341,"2003-07-22",4.4,"Hmmm...another great beer by Southampton Publick House!  Very complex BSA - heavily spiced with warming herbs.  Anise is obviously a big part of it, but cloves are also strong.  Carbonation is a little too intense for my taste, which is my only complaint at all.  Yeasty aroma, cake-like flavor.  Mellow sweetness left to linger on you palate.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"
2341,"2003-07-07",4.7,"750 ml (2003): brilliant orange under a moderate rocky head. . . Full aroma in which I take in orange dough, yeast, spicy cloves, and fruits (white grapes, nectarine, apples, pears).  Tantalizing mouth feel - bubbly, tingling strawberries, perfect carbonation. . . Finish is truly unique and amazing in not only the flavours, but the feeling - soft fruits, spicy herbs and nutty natural flavours linger on the tongue while tingling the whole body. . . Overall subtle perfection and amazing complexity align for a wonderful experience and beer very deserving of such high marks!  Trap, thanks so much for your generosity in sharing this gem!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
2341,"2003-06-26",4.7,"UPDATED: JUN 27, 2003 2003 750 ml.  Pours an amber to copper color with a thick, fluffy persistent, lacing head.  The aroma is both subtle and amazingly intense.  Peach, white grape, melon, lemon, orange zest, lively yeast, buttery dough, slight must and superbly soft hops.  The alcohol is hardly noticeable in the nose or the mouth.  So smooth, delightful on the tongue.  The flavor has a little spicy sweetness to open, leading to veritable pastures of fruit, chocolate, and toffee.  The finish is remarkable, subtle and smooth, magnificent.  Slightly bitter, but in the best way possible.  One of the best beers I've had in many, many months.  I cannot thank Trappist Ales Rule enough for allowing me to experience such brilliance in brewing.  A sheer masterpiece...","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
2341,"2003-06-25",4.8,"750 ml Bottle: This Belgian-style strong ale pours a cloudy, copper color with a medium sized, long lasting, white colored head. It has a strong, musty aroma of hops, yeast, lemon, and malt. It has a medium body with lively carboantion and a wonderfully smooth mouthfeel. The flavor is tremendously fruity with notes of grapes, apricots, apples, and oranges. The flavor is unbelievably fruity considering the aroma gives no hint that such fruitiness will be found in the taste. The head lasts the entire glass and leaves nice lacings. The finish is long, sweet, fruity, and slightly hoppy at the end. This one is creamy and unbelievably delicious. This is the best American brewed Belgian style ale I have had. Simply magnificent. I'm going to go cry now because I only bought one bottle while I was in Ney York and probably will not make it up there again any time soon.","Greenville, South Carolina, USA","Uglyradio"
2341,"2003-05-30",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 26, 2004 2003: Draft.  Had a few decent-to-good samples, was wondering when the mastery would set in.  It happened here.  Great banana-caramel yeasty nose, flavor rolls smoothly in with apricots added to the mix, syrupy (but light) mouthfeel, light acidity, light breadiness throughout, extremely sweet but not cloying.  Excellent, might be phenomenal had I been able to do a full bottle (Trap you lucky bastard); as it is I'm itching to have it again.
2004, post TAP NY tasting.  Even better than I remembered, the flavor is just dynamite, hugely sweet but earthy and firmly anchored so as never to get disgusting.  Probably best of the whole weekend.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
2341,"2003-05-20",4.8,"750 ml; no label: Glowing orange shade. Rocky, dirty white foam. Lovely flower laden, soft malty aroma. Pale malt, must, nutty yeast notes, toffee, dough, white grape, phenol, cilantro, and melon. Whispers of pepper and lemon zest. At the time the barny notes emerge, theyre squelched by the perfume, tropical fruitiness, and toffeeish malts. Extremely fluffy, expansive carbonation. Bottle conditioned to perfection. Lightly perfumey flavors trailed by lemon rind, dough, candy sugar, fig, toasted coconut, slick, round citric notes, and a gently coarse earthy bitterness at the back of the throat. Teasingly rich flavors with a perfect layer of complementary acidity. Finishes appetizingly dry and richly creamy with persistent nutty, slightly fruity yeast notes alongside faint diacetyl and leather aspects. Its hard to find anything wrong with a beer that is chock full of clean, delicious yeastiness, gentle hop backbone, perfumey ester, and raw maris otteresque, bready, pale, toffeeish malts. I'll take this over this years Abbot 12.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
