2247,"2015-10-17",1.3,"Timmermans take on the commercial bottled faro style, bottle from Fontana in Sint-Niklaas. Loose, milky, light greyish white, irregular head, thinning out quickly and lying on top of a cristal clear, amberish orange beer with tiny dots of dead yeast floating around everywhere. Weird and all but inviting aroma of raw barbecue sausages (probably from proteins), cooked chicken, mouldy mushrooms, nutmeg, cigarette tobacco, green asparagus, dried orange peel, old apple cake, caramel candy. Sugary onset, marmelade and even a lightly lemonade-like sensation, soft (even almost flat) carbo, citrus peel accent but very artificial, smooth caramelly backbone, no recognizable lambic complexity, nor any bitterness of any significance; thin mouthfeel. The weird umami-like meat and mushroom aromas return retronasally and the sugar sticks a bit in the throat, but fortunately not in an exaggerated way; caramel malt sweetness lingers as well. Artificial citrus effect has more to do with ascorbic acid than anything else, I suspect. A true faro is unfortunately a rare phenomenon these days - whereas it was the most consumed beer style in 19th-century Brussels - but these bottled lemonade interpretations, initiated by Lindemans, were never a good idea and will not help beer afficionados from abroad to appreciate the style. If you want authentic faro, go to Cantillons museum and ask for one. Avoid this kind of artificial sugary crap. This bottle was too old in the first place and probably hasnt been kept in the best of circumstances, but I will not bother trying to find a fresh one, as it will have the same unpleasant sugary lemonade character and probably even more so than this old bottle. Unpleasant in more than one way - I hardly ever pour anything down the drain, but in this case, it did not take me a lot of time deciding its fate.  My expectations of this were low to begin with, but this is actually a lot worse than expected.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Pours with a frothy, off-white head.  The beer is a darkish amber hue that shows a brilliantly clear, dark copper color when held up to the light.  The aroma smells quite sweet, then of fruit (apples, perhaps some pear, though both notes seem like oxidized versions of the fruit), there is a touch of tin, definite oxidized caramel, and something that smells sort of rich and savory smelling or perhaps a bit rotten somehow (I am not sure on this last note, but it smells of something that even Lambic shouldnt smell like).

Wow, quite sweet tasting (especially compared to Girardin Dominicus that I just had); having said that I think that it is not as sweet as Lindemans Faro. There is perhaps a touch of tartness in the finish, perhaps even a bit lemon like, but this is not very sour considering it should have a base of Lambic.  This is quite light bodied, though the sugar does give it some heft.  It is hard to really taste anything anything under the sugar; it definitely tastes like lemon-flavored sweet-tea, and there is a certain fruitiness here too.

The Lambic character seems to have made it less into this than it should have; the aroma is actually entirely devoid of anything resembling Lambic.  Not bad and sort of refreshing, b/c it is so clean, but really seems more like sweet tea with fake lemon added than anything; and I am nor really a fan of that.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The head retreated quickly to a thin ring and a small island.   The nose is mostly simple sugar syrup, but there is a slight underlying Gueuze-like cellar mustiness.  Theres definately some acidity there in the flavor, but the sugar pretty well blankets it from the middle to the finish.  A little cellar funkiness hides in the finish.

Pour wasnt exciting, nice little head from the carbonation and average lacing, but the color was boring (cloudy amber yellow or so, looking into the plastic cup). The aroma was funky (barn-like), citric, and somewhat apple-like. The flavor was outstanding, a nice blend of sweetness and tart sourness.

Tasted from the stylish new labelled bottle with a vintage black & white photo of the brewhouse. Into a lambic flute, a bright ruddy gold with small speckles of yeast floating about. Head formed to a creamy consistency and held for the length producing excellent lacing. Generous aroma I could easily pick up from across the room; reminiscent of mushrooms, sweet caramel, vanilla yoghurt and some barnyard musty and equally tart wheat. Later on it showed a little spicy and fresh fruit like apples, pears and lemons. Wow, first sip almost rattled my teeth loose as it was like chopped lemon and white sugar. Sweetness quickly subsides to reveal some tart and sour citrus fruit, musty goat-hair and light oaky notes that dry it out and a little white wine thats beyond its shy ABV. Body is very light with just a tickle of carbonation upfront before crossing the tongue with a creamy, smooth roundness. Finish seems short, fresh and fruity yet a musty vapour like dank hessian cloth lingers in the back of the mouth (actually a good thing). Not complex like the greater Lambics and the style is one that is barely surviving modern times, yet personally I liked it. Fresh, fruity and summery. Not bad!!!

Sweet flavor with some sourness hiding underneath. Not much flavor besides the sweet- and sourness, only a bit of lemon. Not very good, just as expected!Earlier Rating: 12/17/2004 Total Score: 2.3Sampled from bottle at Stockholm Beer & Whisky Festival 2004 (#42).Orange golden body with a disappearing head. Sweet sugary and woody aroma, smells a little old?! Sweet flavor with notes of peach, sugar and little citrus with some dry woody tones. Rather cloying. Too candied and reminds me of a soda pop.","Brooklyn, Alabama, USA","Jeppe"
2247,"2005-06-01",2.5,"(on bottle) Dark, orange, with white head. The balance of cane sugar and acid/citrus is OK, both in sent and taste. Would be a great starter.","DENMARK","JensenTaster"

2247,"2005-05-26",2.3,"Bottled @ KØ 2005: Golden coloured. Clear. Light brown head. Acidic and very sweet beer. Some sourness is present, but IMO not enough to stand up to the sweetness. Is rather sweet and cloying in the end. A dull faro.","Søborg, DENMARK","madsberg"

2247,"2005-05-12",2.5,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2006 (Bottle 25 cl) Amber coloured, very light in body with loads of sugar almost completely overpowering the acidity. A rather mainstream attempt at a Faro. But credit for the try. Its still a pleasant drink. 110893","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"

2247,"2005-04-26",2.3,"A hazy orange beer with a collapsing white head. The aroma is lemony sour. The flavor is just like the ascorbin acid, that my Grandfather always gave me when I had a cold when I was a kid.Earlier Rating: 9/17/2003 Total Score: 2.9The aroma is sour and a little sharp with a metallic note. The color is a slightly hazy orange and it has no head. The flavor is sweet, sugary and slightly sour and metallic with a funny slightly malty note.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"

2247,"2005-03-27",3.1,"Bottle from Beers of Europe, and labelled as Timmermans Faro Tradition. Coppery orange, with a thick, soapy white head. Sour funk aroma, with some treacle. A bit mixed. For most of the mouthful I liked this: it has a gentle sourness, with some cola sweetness, blended in a fairly friendly way. The finish however sees things untangle - artificial, plasticky flavour and a sugared water feeling. Half and half.","Birmingham (via Leicester), West Midlands, ENGLAND","DanielBrown"

2247,"2005-02-18",2.1,"Bottled.  An orange coloured beer with no head and quite high carbonation.  The aroma is very sweet with cane sugar notes, and there also seems to be some ammonia.  The taste is sweet and a bit fusty and medicinal.  There are peach notes but in all the beer feels very seet and childish.  Not really very enjoyable.","Wootton, Northampton, Northamptonshire, ENGLAND","maeib"
2247,"2004-10-15",3.1,"Timmermans Faro Tradition.Bottle from Beers of Europle. Sweet and sour, gueuze like with reserved sweetness. Rather odd, is that Lindemans Gueuze is actually less sweet than this faro, from a supposedlly commercial brewery.","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Joeh"

2247,"2004-04-15",3.7,"Brite yellow golden color.  Average head retention.  The aroma is subtle for a lambic, mostly cidery.  The flavor is out of this world.  The sour tart dryness of the beer is combated with a sharp sweetness.  Comprable to a sharp gouda cheese.  Quick dry finish, very well balanced, leaving the palate craving more.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fomentateur"
2247,"2004-03-27",2.7,"Aroma is very sweet, little tartness, quite fruity. Hazy, orange/brown coloured with a lasting white head. Taste is sweet, very sweet. Fruity, some tartness and a little wood. Palate is some mix between sticky and dry. Weird beer. Not really my thing.","Baarn, NETHERLANDS","skortila"
2247,"2004-03-25",3.0,"Pale amber, slight haze; yellowish foam, gone in seconds. Very sour nose - acetic acid, and in no mean way. Something fruity, but not very natural, mixes in. Taste: in the background, a heavy sour, acetic laden presence makes itself known. But it is battled to death by a ""smooth"" (in the Bacardi-Smirnoff-BMC meaning) sweetish flavour that is partly brown sugar (surprise) and partly something less definable. Slight acid burn, not refreshing enough because of the candi syrup, but this fills in the body. Not my cup of tea. Different flavours sit uneasy upon each other, and it chafes.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
