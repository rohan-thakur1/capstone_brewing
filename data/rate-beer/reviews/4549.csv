4549,"2015-05-29",4.7,"A remarkable beer. Tried it on draft three or four times; later bought some plastic bottles of it at the brewery to lug home as perishable souvenirs. Grateful to Evan for the recommendation. Just as tasty and compelling from the bottles (fresh) as from the tap. Hazy dark gold color in any case, pillowy head if the pour is done properly. This is a ""traditional"" pale lager done with oomph, showcasing bright, herbal hop aroma that shares billing with mild, sack-fresh malt and only faint whiffs of diacetyl; juicy-herbal hop flavor, mild honey-malt taste, and a firm bitterness which lingers just long enough... that increasingly short gap between gulps. It is as bitter and as aromatic as many IPAs but probably more drinkable than any of them. This is a regular beer that tastes like beer but with the beer flavor cranked up to, er, 12(°).","Berlin, GERMANY","JoeinDahlem"
