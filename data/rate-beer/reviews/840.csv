840,"2015-04-19",3.6,"0,5 l bottle from local dursty, best before 4/12/2015. Minimally hazy, golden yellow with a huge, frothy, stable, white head. Citrusy, grassy aroma of lemon, lime, mango, lychee and hints of butter. Sweetish, citrusy taste of lemon, lime, mango, grass and lychee, again with minimal hints of butter. Medium long, slightly bitter finish. Medium body, smooth and slightly creamy mouthfeel, lively carbonation. Really good! Harmonic and refreshing with a very nice IPA-ish aroma/taste. Good beer does not have to be expensive (1,10  for 0,5 l)!","Hagen / Bonn, GERMANY","Zlotta"

Aromas of straw, citrus/grapefruit peel, flroal, roses, blossom, white grapes, light lychee with a hint of liquorice.

840,"2015-01-05",3.4,"An interesting example of Germany starting to play with more expressive hops in lagers. Pours hazy gold with sturdy head, redolent of lemon candy with a tinge of vodka. Rather sweet, rolling into a fair smack of bitterness. Has a sticky resinous quality. Some alcohol warmth. Despite the sweetness and resin this is a more elegant attempt than most Ive tried. Happy to drink another.","Berlin, GERMANY","JoeinDahlem"
840,"2014-12-11",3.9,"0,5l Flasche. Orangenes Bier mit einer tollen Schaumkrone. Riecht heftig nach Aromahopfen. Schmeckt dezent malzig, wunderbar nach Hopfen ohne zu bitter oder penetrant zu wirken; abgerundet wird es durch ein angenehmes fruchtiges Aroma. Positiv überrascht!","","Cerbier"
840,"2014-11-08",3.7,"Half litre flip top bottle poured into an oversized Tripel Karmeliet tulip. A: Golden colour, slightly hazy, large thick looking head morphed into a lid of film, lots of lacing. S: Citrus hops and mango. T: Gives you an initial hit of mango coupled with some sweetness, this gave way to a grapefruit like bitterness, some cork at the finish. M: Slightly heavy body, moderate carbonation, slid down very nicely. O: Germany discovers the IPL, very well made, at 6.3% abv means it should be given respect and not consumed by the bucket load, although its highly tempting.","Greater London, ENGLAND","Jonb5"
840,"2014-11-06",3.5,"Light orange colour, big white head. Aroma of hops, soap. Taste is light to medium sweet, slightly bitter. LIght body, oily texture, average carbonation.","CZECH REPUBLIC","angelkostvo"
840,"2014-10-30",3.4,"0,5 l bottle bought @ a local bottle shop. A lot of pressure in the bottle. Dark golden and nearly clear in the glass, mighty white head. A lot of floral hop and yeast in the air. Starts mid herb, getting stronger to bitterness with fruity background, alcoholic sharpness. Cookies, a little bit malt. Smoother but not soft ending. Interesting.","Oldenburg, GERMANY","WillemsUrenkel"
840,"2014-10-18",4.0,"Von der Nase her wundervoll hopfig mit einer hocharomtischen Sorte und Note von Zitrone und etwas Schweiss. Geschmacklich gar mild, süffig und stellenweise laff. Verzicht auf brutale Bitterkeit zum Schluss. Beinahe ein hopfiges Helles. Daumen hoch !","Wanne-Eickel, GERMANY","MichaelAwesome"
840,"2014-10-18",3.5,"Bottle from Getränkemarkt Fristo in Bamberg. The beer pours out in a deep golden colour with steady head and medium body. Aroma of hops and citrus with some flowery hints. Taste of intense fresh hops, light barley, bread, citrus, pine, oak, spruce, grass and mild herbs. Quaffable and enjoyable beer with a medium high carbonation and flowery finish. Good beer.","Reutlingen, GERMANY","McTapps"
