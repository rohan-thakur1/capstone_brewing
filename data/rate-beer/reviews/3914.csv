3914,"2016-11-01",4.3,"Bomber drunk 10/15/16.Lightly to minimally hazy, pale, straw-golden body shows a sparkling effervescence creating a white head atop that is well-retained.Beautifully done passion fruit in the nose is highly aromatic and combines with the light lactic acid to provide intense brightness but also some earthy, funky notes, as well. Honey notes from the malt provide ample balance, with wheat providing a healthy, grainy-tartness. Tart and lovely, this is just pure passion fruit goodness. No alcohol or flaw.Acidity is actually quite gentle on the palate, as light passion fruit sugars help soften things, in concert with the soft, ""chewy"" wheat. Easygoing lactic character provides tartness and dryness with very light pineapple suggestions, as well as lime and guava, as the passion fruit integrates. Exquisitely tight carbonation further concentrates the wonderful flavors left behind by the fruit. No alcohol or flaw. Could drink gallons of this stuff. Especially on account of the easygoing, clean, acidity. Nothing punchy or twangy here.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3914,"2016-10-16",3.9,"650 ml bottle shared by ClarkVV. Bright hazy yellow in appearance. Aroma has an ass ton of passion fruit just with the lightest note of tart funk.
Flavor is mostly passion fruit purée with a very mild tartness in the finish. I like it, it does taste good. But to me it the passion fruit covers any other flavor that wanted to be here. I solely taste fruit juice. Good light body and proper carbonation. For a fruited Berliner, it is very easy to drink!","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
