2973,"2016-02-09",1.9,"Sampled during RBWG Tampa 2015. Gold pour with a small head. Fairly oxidized, disappointing aroma. Knackered grain. Sort of papery. Flavor is sort of grainy. A bit of pale malt. Unsavory papery element that I cant get past. Would have loved to have tried this at its peak. Thanks, Dr. Owl.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"

Medium sweet flavor with sugary white bread, plain white table sugar. Medium bodied with fine carbonation. Sugary finish but reasonably well balanced, with touches of tangerine meringue. Nice one.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

2973,"2015-02-21",3.3,"Tasted during RBWG grand tasting. Thanks to drowland for sharing. Clear golden color, some fine particles floating about. Ring of white head. Corn, bread, biscuit. Pretty surprisingly clean, actually. Especially for an older beer. Medium body, lighter than youd expect for an 8% beer. Light slick texture. Very light carbonation. Would definitely be swiggable. Moderate to bigger sweet taste, very light bitter. Touch of apple / pear. Solid stuff, much better than expected.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
