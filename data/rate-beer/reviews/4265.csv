4265,"2017-05-15",3.8,"Pretty, scenty, & smooth - this far exceeded my expectations! Pours cloudy gold w/ a retaining white head & exuberant lacing. The aroma is a nice blend of malt, hop, & a touch floral. The taste is bready w/ just a slight hint of hops. The body is soft & creamy making this highly drinkable. Terrific!","DOVER, Delaware, USA","jrodooo5"
4265,"2017-01-27",3.3,"Bottle picked up for 2.50, 1 month after best by date. Unfiltered orange-tan body. Frothy, steady, glass rimming bright white head. Bready, easy drinking...in its not so fresh state it reminds me a lot of a Landbier...mellow earthy tones. Pretty drinkable and mellow. OK.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"

4265,"2016-12-16",3.7,"Bomber from The Malt Shoppe, 9/21/16. Clear golden copper, large foamy white head, good retention. Aroma of toasted pale malt, earthy and herbal notes, mild caramel. The taste is toasted malt, citrus hops, dry caramel. Medium bodied, refreshing, moderate carbonation, well balanced.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
4265,"2016-12-12",3.4,"Bottle stamped best before 16 Dec 2016. Pours gold with a faint haze and a lasting white head. Aroma is hoppy in the way of lemon, flowers, malty in the way of toasted sourdough with a quiet toasted corn effect, but after some time warming it turns out to be DMS (must, cauliflower, creamed corn). In the mouth its medium bodied with chewy, honey-ish sugar and a soft break into a clean finish. A little rough in texture (could probably be lagered longer) and limp in carbonation, and its certainly malt-focused but the noble hop touches are pretty nice.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
4265,"2016-11-12",3.1,"Pour is a clear golden with a large white head. Aroma is a nice almost raw bread dough malt with some bitter hops. Flavor is more of the nice lager malt it is not as bitter as I thought but there is a decent amount of hops after the swallow. This Is a pretty solid take on the style with a real nice lager malt bill.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
4265,"2016-10-27",4.3,"Bottle from Brewtopia. Golden with chill haze lasting head and lace. Crackery grassy aroma. Crackery light grainy sweetness with a touch of honey. Medium grassy spicy bitterness in wicked clean bready finish. Light body light fine internal carbo enough to spice up the hops and blend the subtle flavors. Totally FUCKIN EXCELLENT.","Springfield, Vermont, USA","malrubius"

4265,"2016-10-18",3.9,"Bottle. Moderate to heavy grain and straw for the malt, moderate herbs for the hops, light soap for the yeast, with notes of paper in the background. Head is large, frothy/creamy, white, with good lacing and is mostly lasting. Color is sparkling clear amber. Flavor starts slightly sweet and lightly to moderately acidic, then finishes moderately acidic and bitter. Palate is light to medium, watery with a lively carbonation and a lightly dry finish. This Helles is top notch. It rates right up there with the best German Lagers.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"
4265,"2016-10-11",3.6,"Bomber from Craft Beer Kings. Pours bright gold with a white head. Aroma is bready, and its making me think more of garlic than grass. Or grassy garlic? Med body, or nearly. Flavor is bready, and it is grassy - not garlicy!!!!! Im liking this a lot compared to Marzens. Long time since Ive had a Dortmunder. Remembering an imported can in a bar in Tiajuana many decades a go. The can was the real deal! Anyway this is a very drinkable lager.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

Flavor has toasted sweet malts, earthy hops, spicy, and light grass. Finish has a nice spicy bite. Bought this on a whim and sure glad I did. If this were in cans it would be a regular in my fridge.
