2921,"2017-06-04",2.6,"Full pour (from an already open bottle?) at Glens Natural Market. It is a fairly clear and very pale yellow. Nose feels a bit vinegary or maybe it is from the oak? That other Millstone weve had carried the same feeling so I guess this is the house character? Some leathery notes. Light buttery oak. Definite acetic acid in the flavors. Throat burn. Not as bad as the other Millstone Ive had but still far from what Id like it to be (acetic-free, that is). Body is light. Meh. Giving up on Millstone (although I just checked and it seems like Hopvine was pretty chill).","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
2921,"2017-01-27",1.1,"Beautiful looking cider with good presentation. The aroma is acidic and vinegary. The taste is tart/sour like sucking on a warhead candy. The pucker factor is amazing. The palate is thin and watery with a tingly/acidic feeling on the lips. If anything, I think my bottle, fresh from the store, is bad and skunky?","Woodbbridge, Virginia, USA","canis187"

2921,"2015-08-21",3.9,"750mL swing-top bottle.  Batch No. 007.  A milky pale straw colored pour with a few big floaties and no head at all.  The tart aroma features lots of apples, funky cheese, sour lemons, Brett, vinous notes, grass, and a touch of honey.  Goes down thin with a low level of carbonation.  The taste is tangy and tart the whole way through with lots of apples, sour lemons, a funky cheesy quality, and a little honey.  Quite acidic.  Faintly woodsy.  A dry finish that lingers.  Strikingly similar to the sour ale I just had, only better.  I really like this.","Washington DC, USA","lamas"

2921,"2014-04-01",3.5,"20140401 swingtop 750ml bottle from Friendship in Abingdon. Pale golden with a green tinge to it, its totally still. Nice job with the wax on this bottle, by the way. Despite the swing top, it was easy to crack away and doesnt stick to the gasket, etc...its the little things. So, I continue to have a hard time trying these ciders. The tasting room has unfortunate hours for my schedule, and the bottles are pretty pricey for experimentation. Theyve had some tasting sessions locally, but never at the right time. tired of waiting, because Ive enjoyed what other ciders Ive had from Millstone, I just picked up a few. Hoping that this cider was going to be rather more bracing with its dryness, so as to be a sharp contrast to some spring veggie soups Ill be downing this week, and I think its hit the mark. Pea soup, asparagus soup, lentil-onion soup all were improved on the palate with this interplayed, as their earthy tones and slight sweetness were a great complement. The aromas are strictly musty apple and fine gauze with old, rotty wood and fresh mud. Its not as complex as that sounds, really, as its nicely simple and, perhaps, more rustic than Id hoped. I think I understand what they were going for with the description, and it seems that theyre there. I could drink this one by the flagon, or have a serving with a meal, but the in-between just wouldnt be right. I dont see having a few glasses of this tongue scraper sitting out on the deck, or coupled with fattier foods (nuts, avocado, olives). Its musty character is but a wisp, and more quickly forgotten than the time it took to ramble through this commentary. All that being said, carbonated ever so mildly, this would be nearly vinho verde, and even at $16 a bottle could see a steady place in my summer rotation.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
