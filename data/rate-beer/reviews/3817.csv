3817,"2017-04-01",4.2,"Butelkowane 05/12/2016. Piwo po przelaniu mętne, nieprzejrzyste z dużą długoutrzymującą się pianą. W aromacie Bretty niezbyt agresywne, uderzają natomiast niezwykle intensywne, kwiatowe i owocowe nuty (owoce tropikalne, głównie ananas). Chmielenie na najwyższym poziomie. A mistrzostwem jest umiejętność sprawienia żeby te Bretty podbiły aromaty chmielowe, nadając im fajny owocowy charakter. Smak lekko goryczkowy na finiszu. Alkohol w ogóle niewyczuwalny - pije się jak sok, albo jakieś dobrze nachmielone, kremowe pale ale. Niezwykle odświeżające, jedwabiste, kremowe. Poziom wyżej od ""Brettowych"" piw z Wicked Weed. Biorąc pod uwagę prawie 4 m-ce od butelkowanie jest bardzo dobrze. W lodówce czeka jeszcze wersja BA Dorothy ;).","Sosnowiec, POLAND","BlazerT"

Surprisingly underwhelming. After just visiting Blackberry Farm and having 4.2 to 4.7 caliber beers, I have to say Im fairly disappointed with this first beer (for me) from Mr Hill. Sour and generic and watery. Dry hopping with rawly scented hops doesnt help matters. And why does Monks serve this in shaker pints, lol.

Beer pours lightly hazy, pale yellow, with a big ol white head and nice lacing on the glass.

The aroma is more hop forward than anything, big melon & orange fruity notes. The funkiness in the nose is present but restrained letting hop brightness take center stage. Its got a little horse stable, some doughy bread, and a little lemon.

The flavor is really a nice balance of tartness, bitterness, and bright fruit forward hops. Im actually surprised just how tart this beer is, I mean its far from puckering but it brings a nice lemon-like character that matches well with the bright citrus and passionfruit like hop character. The level of bitterness is really well done here as well, higher than one usually expects from either a citra or brett focused beer... but it works pretty well here. The beer is pretty darn dry and Im awfully surprised the alcohol level is as high as 7% here, there is almost no booziness to it, Id guess it around 5% or lower.

3817,"2015-08-16",4.2,"Majority of 750 mL bottle, consumed on 8-9-15. Bottle purchased for me by my parents at the brewery on a trip to New England. Bottle labeled 2015 04 22, so I drank it at about 3.5 months old, which isnt ideal for a hoppy beer, but it seemed to hold up quite well. Nice, wheaten, saison aroma. Strong, very pleasant, grassy smell features scents of hay and lemongrass. Pours a hazy straw color with a tornado of bubbles. Moderate amount of long-lasting, uneven, cream-colored head. Looks like yellow Chartreuse (the liqueur) in color, with almost a greenish tint. Nice milkiness in the later pours. Looks fantastic. New Zealand hops unmistakable in the taste. Tropical fruitiness: Mango and citrus, including orange and tangerine. Dry yet juicy. Light tartness; hint of rhubarb. Some seawater. Clean, yeasty taste with a hint of chlorine. Quite dry finish that also includes almost a meatiness. Very nice, refreshing, dry finish and aftertaste. This is good! Long, dry, vegetal, grassy aftertaste. Light to medium body, light for the ABV. Good liveliness. Soft in the palate. This is my first Hill Farmstead beer, and I come away thinking that the hype is justified. Despite drinking this with a few months of age, I find that the hoppiness seems well preserved, and I dont think that I missed out on too much extra hops effect. This is a darn good beer, delicious and sophisticated.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

This airy and refreshing brew showcases citrusy tropical fruit, brettanomyces wilderness and an acidic touch in a most elegant mouthfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam tops the glowing yellow.
-Drinkability is very high, as it usually is for a Hill Farmstead ale.
-The flavor profile is well balanced.
-This is the usual level of excellence for a Hill Farmstead brew.
-This was a great pairing with Chèvre à Ma Manière, a creamy goat cheese.

3817,"2015-08-02",4.8,"Bottled on 04 22 2015.
This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a nice hazy pale yellow to orange color with a thick two finger rocky foamy head that dissipated within less than thirty seconds.
The smell started off with a sharp sweet lemon rind and pulp combining over sweet freshly cut grassy tones. Lemongrass makes a subtle presence to blend nicely.
The taste was mainly sweet with blends of the lemon, lemongrass, grass, and a light floral tones to balance. Theres a quick sweet lemon to floral aftertaste leading to a quick dry finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly smooth and allows sweet floral to honey rich tones to run over my tongue.

Aroma: It has an aroma of bright brett funk, has that typical earthy, funky aroma, horse blanket, or whatever. The citrus tones shine through underneath as well, but the brett dominates for me

Appearance: Pours a bright gold color with a large, almost soapy looking head and heavy lacing

Flavor: The taste is funky as well, little more citrus, and some spicy Saison yeast as well

Palate: The body is medium, the carbonation is lively, super drinkable, with a nice dry finish

Overall Impression: 
The brett works really nicely here. It drys it out quite well, as you might expect. It also plays quite well with the citrus/lemon and the yeast/spice undertones. Makes for a really enjoyable overall combination. I liked this version quite a bit. For a beer with this much carbonation it is extremely drinkable.

3817,"2015-04-24",4.0,"Bottle (750 ml). 03-2015 bottling. 

Appearance: Hazy glowing yellow-golden with a medium easy to revive white head and good lacing. 

Aroma: Citrus forward (orange peel, tangerine, lemon) along dusty brettanomyces, mineral notes, subdued but interesting farmhouse charachter and light spiciness. 

Taste: Citrus forward but light bright than in the aroma while the dusty brettanomyces takes more place. Quite mineral as well with light tingling spiciness and moderate bitterness.

Palate: Medium body. Medium carbonation. Dry finish. Lingering mineral presence. Dusty and citrusy as well. 

Overall: I wouldnt say its better than the previous version of Dorothy but its certainly different. More in line with their other Saison and while its similar to Wheat is the New Hops (as stated in the description) this one is less bright, heavier and the citrus isnt shining nearly as much.

S - Orange peels, pepper, lemon, funky wheat and hay. Citra dry hopping totally having a field day in the aroma.

Quite complex. Taste is orange and grapefruit rind fading into a spicy, doughy middle with orange, pine, hints of mango, and citrus rind bitterness on the finish.
