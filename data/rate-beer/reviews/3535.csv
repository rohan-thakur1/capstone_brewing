3535,"2017-03-22",3.6,"EBF 2017. Sample looks like a glass of orange juice, really. No head, no lacing and you cant see through the orange liquid. Nose is of fuzzy yellow fruits (more apricots than peaches). Taste is moderately acidic, pretty cleanly lactic, refreshing. A bit too sour perhaps but not that bad. Body is light and carbonation moderately high. Way more palatable than their Hit Em with the Hein Ive had before it. A pretty refreshing fruited berliner that is way less gimmicky than their usual offerings!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
3535,"2017-03-14",4.4,"Crowler from Paul - huge thanks for this one. Pours a deep murky orange body similar to pineapple juice. Soft passionfruit and tart tropical fruits on the nose. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and juicy with notes of passionfruit, fuzzy peach skins, fleshy apricot, tart sugar, brine and strawberry seeds. Pure juice.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
3535,"2017-03-13",4.4,"Draught at EBF, 2/3/17.Heavily cloudy, New England IPA-appearance with a rocky, white head atop that shows good retention for a gose.Juicy, tart and rich with light salinity, moderate lactic acids integrated with the fruit and honey-like malts. All of the juiciness of a NE IPA with the lip-smacking tropical fruit and deep, complex interaction of the lactic acid, salt and malt. Its highly aromatic, yet clean and not overdone on the salt, fruit or lactic acid. Waves of pineapple, guava, passion fruit and light mango seem endlessly sniffable.Intensely juicy in the mouth, with a good mix of lactic acid, tropical fruit juiciness and salinity, its like the best of both worlds between a NE IPA and an American sour. Tart fruits, a soft, wheat and malt-laden texture and tight carbonation. Great attenuation, no excess lactic acidity and wonderfully crisp and quenchingly tart on the finish. Fantastic and maybe my number one beer of the fest.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3535,"2017-02-22",3.3,"on tap at extreme beer fest 2017, boston. muddy orange juice-looking, little to no head, no lacing either. tart if not sour apricots, julep *TM orange juice, medium acidity level - acetic oranges; lots of sea salt, fresh coriander, chalky yeast. moderate carbonation, light body, fairly tart herbal-citrusy finish. lots of similarities of salted orange juice with a dash of vinegar. not my thing though. just wishing that no snozzberries have been harmed during the crafting of this gose.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"

Some lace. Aroma is salty brine with a lemon citrus and cereal grains. The taste was damn good for a gose and was a salty balanced tart lemon and lime. Some grains on the finish. Light body, tart finish. Well carbed. So damn good.","Boca Raton, Florida, USA","Fritz123"
3535,"2015-01-11",3.7,"Draft at MBCP Day. Nose is fruity but hard to identify with a sharp acidity/sourness in the nose. Pour is slightly hazy pale yellow. Taste is very sour and puckering, but then again, I drank mostly porters and stouts this particular day. Overall a very nice and tart beer, I hope to have it again on a better palette.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"

3535,"2014-11-30",4.5,"Un verre de 12 onces sur place. Jaune voilé avec une mousse qui souhaite la résistance. Kiwi, coriandre, blé sûr, sel, fruits astringents, Berliner, Gose, Wild, herbes et tout le tralala rattaché à une bière qui quelque fois te fait dire tout simplement wow! Bouche comme des fruits exotiques et surets trempés dans une solution épicée et saline. Cest vraiment bon! Un yaourt aux kiwis? Cest possible ça? Encore une fois, tout est question déquilibre. Et ici, cest ce qui est merveilleux. Je pourrais aussi rajouter que cest aussi du Funky, tout simplement! Pétillante et légère au palais. Texture gonflée par des saveurs incroyables. Une finale délicieuse comme la sueur salée qui perle la joue dune Australienne qui embrasse une Néo-Zélandaise. Meilleure bière de mon voyage. Complètement débile. Tellement facile à boire. Tout simplement superbe.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

A: Cloudy lemon color with no head. Huge gusher - its head asplode.

N: Lemon, salt, ""snozzberry"", agave, coriander, grapefruit rind, and a touch of wood. Something like dragonfruit. 

T: Sour and appreciably salty. Slight sweetness. 

M: Tingling carbonation, very light body. 

O: After Gose Gone Wild, I find its competitors have a lot of room to grow. Still, I would have this one again, provided it doesnt commit to a reenactment of a grade school science fair volcano.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
3535,"2014-08-29",5.0,"Great....sour mango, and corriander aroma. Pretty tart but real balance with its tartness and apricot jam. ZSour come back trough and fairly dry finish. Just an overall great beer all around. A+++","New York, USA","Ionlyrate5s"

3535,"2014-03-21",4.2,"Bottle with huge thanks to 50belair! Pours cloudy golden amber with a small off-white fizzy soda like head that dissipates very quickly and leaves no lacing. Aroma is quite passion fruity, lemon, light funk. Flavor is medium tart, instantly drying out the mouth, lots and lots of passionfruit and stone fruit inside, amazingly fruity actually, some funky horse blanket notes as well. Not really getting a lot of salt, but with so much else going on perhaps that is not surprising. Medium body and quite fizzily carbonated in the mouth, dries you out and then leaves saliva in its wake. Pretty darn tasty, I must say!","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"

Bravo....","Florida, USA","50belair"
3535,"2014-02-15",4.6,"Bottle at share at SARA. Thanks for offering this up. Aroma and flavor of, it seemed, slightly salted guava, passionfruit and nectarine skins. This is one of the most unique, if not the most unique soured beer Ive had. If you all dont know what a snozzberry is beyond Willy Wonka, its a dick bros, so Im not going to say it tastes like snozzberries.

Medium-bodied and mildly creamy with vibrant carbonation. The flavor is so delightfully, involuntarily-eye-squinting sour and tropical fruity - passionfruit, lemon and star fruit. Fruity and sour finish with only a rumor of salt. Freaking awesome beer from a production facility that had yet to impress me with any of its offerings! Seems as if theres hope after all. Well see.
