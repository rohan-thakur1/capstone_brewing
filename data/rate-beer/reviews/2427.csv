2427,"2015-09-20",4.0,"Draft. Dark mauve hue, opaque, with a thin ring of pink-tan froth. The flavor takes the best aspects of your standard apple cider -- semi-sweet apple, a hint of tartness -- and adds wrinkles like blueberry, floral honey and mildly toasted oak. Those last two add notes of orange blossom and coconut that arrive mostly in the finish, which also has a bit of lingering cotton candy. Aroma blends Fuji apples, blueberry, orange blossom and roses. The blueberry addition is perfect, adding to the apples but not overpowering then. Very complex, well-balanced stuff.","","PartyFowle"

2427,"2015-07-29",3.8,"Draft at Whole Foods Chandler. A deep, decadent blueberry aroma wafts for the 8-oz. wine glass along with sharp honey, a touch of molasses, and old oak barrels. Pours a flat dark royal purple. Extremely berry forward with strong Pinot grape notes. The berries are more tart than sweet and lead to a very dry finish. The wine tones grows as the cider warms and are accompanied by a moderate woody taste (more grape stems than barrel notes) and bits of ripe apple. Faint tones of brown sugar and vanillin try to fight their way through the fruit, but never push past the background. Quite nice, but its not even close to as good as Superstitions world-class meads.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
