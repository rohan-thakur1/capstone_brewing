The smell is hard to glean out of the tasting glass, but the flavor is thick and quenching, flavorful, and engaging. Deep custard and flan provide the sweet backbone, and some smoked peanuts add some savory umami to the mixture. In the mid-taste caramelized (burnt?) honey appears too. Banana and clove are present, adding complexity and a bit of spice, and there is, of course, a persistent background of a raw wheat taste, light and mild, but true to form. But as far as the descriptor goes, I just keep coming back again to those rich custard notes, with taste ""real"", like a high-class restaurant desserts custard, but in beer form.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

The aroma is really reminiscent of banana cream pie. Taste is sweet bananas, huge sweet bubblegum, clove, spices, doughy, fruity esters, and straw with a medium spicy finish. Medium mouthfeel with soft carbonation. A touch sweet for me, but a nice hefeweizen nonetheless.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
