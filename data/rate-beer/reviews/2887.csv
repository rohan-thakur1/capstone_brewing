2887,"2017-05-01",4.4,"Pours a brassy gold with a white head. Aroma is soft and sweet, honey and yogurt with floral notes of Aesculus and Ceanothus, plus barbs of lemon and lime and a subtle gin accent. Flavor is a fabulous balance of sharp tangerine sourness, apricot Stilton cheese, and chardonnay. An acidic punch lingers long after each sip. Carbonation is just right, finish is dry and graceful.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
2887,"2017-02-02",4.0,"From notes. Had at a tasting with the group at Eriks house on January 22. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a darker golden orange with a small white head that lingers for a bit as a thin ring. The aroma is nice and clean. There is a good light fruitiness to it, a hint of citrus sour, a light barnyard funk, and a touch of oak going on. Its clean, balanced, and lovely. The flavor is much of the same. Light tropical fruits and citrus sourness up front, a solid dusty barnyard moving through toward the back, and a hint of graininess as it wraps up. Its not complex by any means, but is really clean and crisp. The mouth feel is light and well carbonated with a lingeringly funky tropical fruit and a hint of sourness on the back end. This is another great saison from SARA.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

2887,"2016-08-01",4.5,"Merci à Rémi pour le partage. Une vraie bombe dans le domaine Saison! Liquide à l robe profondément orangée et presque sans bulles malgré une forte agitation carbonique dans mon verre. Beaucoup de fruits et de complexité dans cette bière pourtant non fruitée et funky à souhait! J passe de la clémentine, à la pêche à chair blanche, en passant par de la pomme et de labricot. Remarquable complexité, tant dans le fruit que dans un funk vivant, jeune et vigoureux. Attaque ponctuée par une effervescence qui ne séteint jamais. Une saison sauvage des mieux réussies à mon avis!","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
2887,"2016-07-18",4.8,"bottle shared by a friend at our tasting. it poured to one of the most beautiful saison colours i have ever seen. first pours where clean clear gold, poured the entire bottle 4-ways, it turned into a delicate clouded yellow golden with orange colours and a lasting white light head on top. they are right the this has to be one of not their best beer. the wine barrel aroma is just insane! combined with a clean balanced funky acidity, juicy white wine, light sour white grapes, clean melon, crisp grains, oak, vinous tart white wine, vanilla oak, lemon tartness, sweet tropical fruit. taste even show a sweet apricot, layers of different wine barrel notes. what a mouth watering saison. so clean and delicate. this reminds me a lot of the colab they did with hill farmstead (works of love), but this is something from a whole other level. i even enjoyed it more than westly, what a masterpiece. maybe the best saison i have had! amazing experience!","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"
