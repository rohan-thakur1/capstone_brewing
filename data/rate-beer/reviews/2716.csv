2716,"2015-05-26",3.8,"330 ml. bottle @ home. Purchased @ De Hopduvel. BBF 01/10/2016. Hazy orange, thin head sticking on the sides, patchy. Nose feels a tad overly yeasty with juicy exotic, passion fruit & mango hops but not as heavy as I would heavy preferred. Balance seems to be slightly off here. Taste is yeasty, typical De Proef Mikkeller lightly sweet dough yeasty, light powdery floor quality, dominates a bit over the hops which are still clearly there, passion fruit, mango & exotic hops, juicy with light fructose / fruit-like sweetness, bitterness in the back is grass-like, yeasty mouthfeel is coupled with a dry finish. It isnt perfect & the familiar Mikkeller territory is explored here. Good but not top tier IPL, balance seems to be a bit missing here maybe it should have been drank fresher, the 2016 BBF date leads me to believe that this might be possibly a few  6 maybe even  months old but without a bottled on date all of that is of course pure speculation on my behalf. Unhinged but still pleasant.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
