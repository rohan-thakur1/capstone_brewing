924,"2016-05-30",3.1,"On tap in Atlanta (GA)

A respectable California Common didnt stand out too much but went well with the order of BBQ that accompanied it. The style is not one of my favorite which might be part of the reason but I have had better versions. Still, if this is respresentative of Red Hares abilities then I will see if I can find more should I find myself in the area again.

Aroma / Appearance - A carbonated bronze body with white head traps waves of crisp grains and a vague bitterness. It does not have much depth but it manages to make its point.

Flavor / Palate - Grain, cool malts, and a nice sessionable texture bloom from the first sip. By the end it becomes forgettable though not extremely bland. I wouldnt turn down a pint on a hot summer evening.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
924,"2015-10-18",3.3,"Can. This is a nice malty brew that can stand up well to some good BBQ meats.","Maputo, MOZAMBIQUE","Imaena"
924,"2015-09-18",2.9,"Pours a clear copper brown on tap with fluffy off-white head that leaves moderate lace. Aroma and taste are what you expect, malty with a hint of yeast fruitiness. Really pretty standard, nothing great, but goes well with food.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","jbruner"
924,"2015-08-01",3.1,"Can:
Pours hazed amber with a small beige head.
Aroma of toasted bread, toffee.
Taste is fairly rich.....caramel malt, breadheel hay..grains.
Nice flavour..., but a bit heavy in body for a CC.....","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"
924,"2015-07-27",3.5,"On tap at the Taco Mac at the Prado. Dark brown color, with a medium, beige, foamy head. The nose is surprisingly deep; notes of whole grains, chalk, and smoke initially, with some hints of apples, floral hops, and cloves. Sweet, with some bitterness that balances fairly well. Medium body, grainy, and a bit chewy. This is a nice, aromatic lager, with a smooth and easy flavor, but quite a lot going on.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"
924,"2015-07-24",3.1,"Can (from Cybercat). Lactic toffee malt and astringent hay aroma. Golden yellow with small head. Sweet toffee malt, light lactic acid, and mild bitter/astringent hay flavor. Medium body.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
924,"2015-06-30",3.7,"Fruity and sturdy brew with a thick creamy texture and a balanced flavor all the way out.","Rosewood, Georgia, USA","Bork"
924,"2015-06-27",3.6,"12 ounce can - $1.99 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours a clear, lightly ambery, lightly copper-toned body with an inch of whitish foam. A smidge of lacing.

Smell: Somewhat sweetish in the nose with a toffee-ish hint, an element of fruitiness and a lightly bready, pale malted barley quality.

Taste: A lightly bready, pale maltiness with a restrained toffee sweetness. Some citrus, some overriding fruitiness. Subtly bitter. With the initial sweet breadiness making a return. Bittersweet, soft finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Simple, soft but fairly refreshing.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
924,"2015-06-23",3.8,"$10 6-pack, Sprayberry Bottle Shop, Marietta. Pours a crystal clear amber with a 2-finger head of medium bubbles that quickly subsides to lumps atop the beer. Aroma is weak, wet hay, caramel, some fruit. Taste is fruity sweetness, buttery smooth finish. Very little hops here. Nice and dry. Certainly not devoid of taste by itself, but stays out of the way of whatever youre eating.","Georgia, USA","finn1918"
924,"2015-06-08",3.2,"12 oz can pours a golden color with a nice white head. Aromas of bread, fruit, light malt. Light bodied, simple and great with a burger","atlanta, Georgia, USA","jw0406"
924,"2015-06-06",3.0,"Tap. Pours a transparent amber with a layer of off white head. Aroma and taste of bread malts and some lemon and pine.","Warner Robins, Georgia, USA","JHeath99"
924,"2015-06-02",3.9,"12oz can. Golden pour. Aroma of pale grains, fruity esters. Tastes pale, sweet & bitter. Lingering hops. Its delicious. Better than Anchor Steam. 
Makes me wonder if this is a warm fermentation of Long Day. (4352)","Georgia, USA","unclemattie"
924,"2014-09-06",4.1,"Pours a clear honey-amber with a respectable and fine-bubbled buff head. Malty aroma is not strong, but tempting, with a nice fruity underpinning. Satisfying flavor has nice malty, fruity and woody hop notes, with an earthy hint. Firm, fizzy texture leaves a woody hop and slightly fruity and yeasty finish. National, maybe, but it aint common!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
924,"2014-08-16",3.5,"Bright yellow color with a white head. Aroma is faint with mainly citrus. Flavor Is slightly malty with some citrus and cereal notes. Overall this good for summer. Refreshing.","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
924,"2014-07-04",3.5,"Really nice beer. Clean. Great beer with food. Caramel, some nuts. Crisp bitterness from hops but not really a hoppy beer. Exactly what its supposed to be.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
