4069,"2016-12-29",4.4,"375mL 2000 bottle at Akkurat, 11/28/16.Clear, bright, peachy-tinged golden; soft, warm hues and just a touch of carbonation from its long captivity in bottle.Nectarine, lemon, cheese rind, light vanilla and touches of dusty, earthy malt all provide a charmingly funky but ""clean"" nose for such an old, small bottle. No oxidation whatsoever, or at least not manifesting itself negatively here. Funky, bright brett with soft tropical fruit suggestions and lots of lactic acid lingering on the end.In the mouth its still, of course, but with just a touch of frizzante-like charm. Meyer lemon and hints of honey soften the hard lactic bite. The wateriness inherent in a still beverage spreads out the sourness instead of concentrating it, thanks to the ultra-dry body; though make no mistake, this is not thin. The end result is a phenomenally drinkable, quenching, simple drink, with moderate funk and a pleasing sour bite on the end. This is exactly what I envision when I think of unblended lambics. If I had to drink a 3 Liter of beer to myself, this is pretty damned near close to what Id choose.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The pour is a murky orangey gold color with no head or sign of carbonation. This is a little different. The aroma is interesting. There is a tart vinegar right up front and a bit of yeast, barnyard, light fruit skin, and a bit of dried hay. Its messy. The flavor is much of the same. There is a light stone fruit to it, but its overshadowed. There is a little bit of leather on top of the barnyard and an oaky funk. The mouth feel is oily and flat as fuck. There is no carb at all, and thats an issue I believe. The aftertaste is lingeringly oaky and funky. There isnt much good happening here.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Mais le rêve sarrête là en matière de dégustation !!! Pour le reste, cette bière ma rappelé dagréables moments à la Bécasse de Bruxelles, où on dégustait ce type de lambic en groupe sur les fameux bancs de bois, en 
chantant toutes les vieilles fariboles des Marolles et autres joyeuseries propres à amuser lâme
ou le coeur des students que nous étions 
Bref, pas grand-chose à se mettre sous la dent avec ce Oude Lambiek de Gooik, dans ce bizarre

La longueur ne montre aucun développement.
Les jambes sont huileuses.

Pours a dark golden orange color thats almost flat with a one finger, bubbly white head that slowly settles into an impressive lasting ring. Spotty lacing left behind. 

Intense aroma with a great balance of lactic funk, acetic acid, barnyard must, pale malt, light fruit and citrus. Funky lactic cheesiness along with oak, wet grass, cobweb and bandaid followed by acetic vinegar, strawberry and citrus rind. Smells absolutely incredible with barnyard funk, horseblanket, acidity and sweet fruit notes bouncing off of each other . I cant imagine any way in which the aroma could be improved. 

Medium bodied with delicate carbonation and a nice balance of lactic funk, acetic acid, oak barrel and sweet fruit. Tart and puckering with the perfect amount of sourness. Great oak barrel and lactic/cheesy funk flavors along with lingering acetic acid thats complimented by light fruit and zesty citrus. Not solvent-like, harsh or overly acidic with strawberry and orange zest sweetness countering the sour funk.

Acidity get more intense, the longer it stays on the palate, leading to a very sour overall impression. Still, it is very enjoyable due to barley malt and dough yeast, keeping the beer in balance. Lemony fruitiness stays on the palate with a dry sourness, leading to an even dryer finish. Easy drinkable and complex at the same time.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Honestly I think the flatness takes a bit away from the brew. Slightly dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium, but somewhat heavy for the lambic style that usually comes off extra dry and light to me.

4069,"2013-10-10",3.7,"0.375l corked bottle from Jan 2009. This is a heavy blurry golden-orange beer with a medium sized quickly fading and quite bubbly little just off-white top. The aroma fills the room with woody bretty lambiek aroma. Lovely. Its quite fruity this actually. Old collared yellow apples and apricots, red berries like red currants, the wood is really present and it just smells exactly like what I was expecting and hoping for. It has a nice almost fizzing average carbonation level but the mouthfeel is almost what I would call watery. Good bretty flavors. More of those old apples that has been sitting in the cellar a bit to long. Woody tart, slightly lemon-ish and it has a slight sweetness towards the finish. The finish and aftertaste is gone a bit quicker than I like, but thats just to lift the glass once more, have a sip and the flavors are back in the mouth. Really refreshing and tasty. Paired great with a big homemade entrecote hamburger. Hmm.. That bottle went quick! 12.02.2013","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"
4069,"2013-09-29",3.9,"750 ml C&C bottle served in a mini snifter. 2003 vintage (MMIII on label). Shared at Northdown with the crew.

A: Pours a hazy orange color with no head forming on the pour. Flat as a pancake.

S: Super funky witha minerally quality to it. Lemon grass with a nice lactic bite. Pretty acidic as well, but the the funk is the star of the show here.

T: The taste follows the nose with the funk. Banyard in nature it very punget and sharp. Light acetone with some sour warhead lemon bite and some lemon grass bitterness.

M: Flat and light bodied. Smooth, sour and dry. Still really nice.

Pour has a yellow golden color with some white foam but no real head and no visible carbonation. Aroma has firm acidity, lemon, some horse blanket, and tart white grape skin. Mouth feel is average for the style on the coating side of things but the almost total lack of carbonation is a bummer. Flavor cranks on the dry acidity, lemon, light flowers, some barnyard, and a long intense finish. Great beer in itself but if I am reading this right is made up of 3 year old lambic and for me missing the younger lambic in the blend takes a bit of the complexity away.

4069,"2011-12-05",3.6,"My Bottom Line :  
As authentic as they come, this Lambics funk and sourness develop citrusy fruitiness and wet haystacks alongside wheat flavors. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A ring of foam surrounds the hazy pale amber.
-Carbonation was quite mellow, which made the sourness feel more potent.
-Flavor definition was not as clear as I would have liked.
-If you are looking for some true Lambic funk, this one will still meet your expectations.

4069,"2011-03-16",4.3,"750ml corked and caged green bottle.

It pours a hazy amber color with a frothy white that leaves surprising lacing.

The smell is pretty enthralling. There is a huge funk that is the main theme with some barnyard and must. There is a definite spice element that is almost woody as well, though the barrels are over 100 years old and are probably filled to the pore with bugs and bacteria. There is some pear and chamomile as well.

It is sour and acidic, with a lot of lemon and vinegar. There is a hint of green tomato. The funk is more subdued in the taste but is still there. The aftertaste is sightly bitter and sour.

The mouthfeel is perfect. It is slightly carbed but still rather flat. It is tart and puckering.

A fantastic brew.

4069,"2010-07-30",3.8,"2000 Bottle vintage, sampled at Chez Moeder Lambic Fontainas; July 2010
This pours with a lightly hazed, amber tinged, still looking body.  The cork popped out though and it has formed a head upon pouring with a pale, off-white, big bubbled head.  This smells nicely of aged foot, ample wood / oak (at least for a Lambic), a spicy almost cinnamon like note, some hints of acetic acid, a light cider character and a fresh cut wood plank aroma that comes off as quite vibrant at times.  A lactic tartness anchors the nose and there are also aromas of tobacco as well as a faded cedar-woodiness.  The aroma is really quite complex and interesting and I am definitely enjoying smelling this beer.

A hint of textural fizz is here, but the beer is largely flat feeling on the tongue.  The beer is lightly sour up front, but finishes with an oak-derived astringency that accentuates the dryness of this beer and, in a complimentary fashion, the tartness.  Lots of wood character is found in the flavor with notes of fresh cut wood, a light spiciness and even some woody pepper notes.  The astringency int eh finish is joined by notes of chalk, pepper and a lactic acidity that fades with time.  This is pretty light bodied and there is just enough texture to keep this from being down right watery (it is not quite there).  The woodiness brings out flavors of mushrooms, musty cellar notes as well as some phenolic influence producing a smell like the burn of a saw blade on wood.

This is not as complex as it could be and the texture is a little flat at times, but this is a straight Lambic, so you have to expect that.  I really like the ample wood character here though.  The aroma is definitely a touch more interesting than the flavor and a bit more balanced too; the texture seems to compete with the balance in the flavor.  Overall though this is a very nice and tasty Lambic, and I would love to have a bunch of these in the cellar.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

This one smelled particularly dusty and dry, which provided nice contrast to the bright fruit.  Flavors were similar, if not a bit more subdued and muddled.

4069,"2007-11-24",4.0,"2005. Hazed amber/deep orange pour. With few bubbles at the perimeter, no head and glistening earthtones, this is unmistakable as an unblended lambic. Levels of barnyard funk similar to offerings from 3 Fonteinen pop out of the glass. Brew-pipe styled Brettanomyces appears and settles in for the duration. Suddenly, a clean, fruity addition rears its pretty head with notes of lemon and peach. The aroma winds into further complexity with toast, horseblanket and moderate leather. Wood and musty grape leaf hints bear down as the first sip draws near. The flavor reminds initially of the greatness that is Cantillon Grand Cru, the benchmark for unblended lambics that are regularly accessible. Another comparison to a great - this is headed in the right direction - but it does have a new path to take. Solid funkiness doesnt come in waves, its quite streamlined and steady, a blanket of oak, lemony sharp acidity and earth. Orange-laden citric notes flow freely, accompanied by low-mild sweetness, medium to medium-high acidity, mild to moderate tartness that begs the next quenching sip, and medium-high sourness that never gets in the way of favorable drinkability - but it never actually eases up either. Finishes very balanced, lightly sugary, moderately tart, hay notes and old wet oak lingering. This has a sweaty suana feeling throughout. Very low carbonation, medium bodied, smooth and awkwardly salty at intermittent points throughout, especially in the brash finish. Excellent.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Good lemon juice acidity, all in all well blended and smooth, fairly light. truly appealing and diplomatic, close to a 9 for the nose. It doesnt quite hold up in flavor where it is juicy, horsey and astringent. There is this herbal bite that feels almost like a tame jalapeno, which would be paired with a straight hay juice shot. Flavors finish very quick and are far more chaotic than in the nose. Correct mouthfeel on the other hand, a bit light, but fully carbonated if the bubbles dont last very long.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
