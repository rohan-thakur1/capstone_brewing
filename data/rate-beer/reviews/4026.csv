4026,"2017-06-01",4.4,"22 oz bottle shared. Mostly clear golden orange with off-white head. Aromas of tropical fruit, citrus, floral notes, pine, garlic. Tastes of tropical fruit, citrus, floral notes, pine. Medium body with a dry finish. Awesome.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","GenDV138"
4026,"2017-05-14",3.9,"22 oz. bottle, consumed on 5-8-17. Peach, grass, and lemon scents. Funky, dank, citric aroma features scents of gym bag and garlic. I really like the aroma. Powerful and enjoyable smell. Pours a hazy bronze with a large amount of cream to beige-colored head with a yellow tint. Suspended particulate in the final pour. Thick lacing. Very nice, citric, hay flavor. Excellent hops here. Onion bread, peach, and lemon tastes. Whole wheat to pumpernickel bread. Garlic in the finish. Lightly dry finish and aftertaste; Id certainly like it to be drier. Light to medium body. Soft and smooth in the palate. Palate effects are somewhat weak compared to the power of the remainder of the beer. A delicious beer, if anything an improvement on the superb original.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
4026,"2017-05-08",3.9,"Bomber from Total Wine Brookfield. Hazy golden amber, large foamy white head, good retention. Aroma of pine, onions, pale malt. Dry. The taste is onion, pine, tropical fruits, mango. Medium bodied, lingering bitterness. Solid.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
4026,"2017-05-04",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 5, 2017 Bottle poured into a wineglass showing moderately filtered golden yellow with half a finger of clean white foam. 

The nose shows a lot of lemon and grapefruit zest. 

The palate is light bodied and moderately carbonated. Moderately intense flavors of lemon, grapefruit, and pineapple with a mild IPA bitterness on the finish. Juicy and refreshing.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"
4026,"2017-05-02",3.7,"Bomber shared. Dark golden pour. Aroma is citrus, pine resin, really nice. Taste is bitter pine up front, lasting bitterness. Great beer just not my jam.","New Hope, Minnesota, USA","thomashall"
4026,"2017-04-28",4.0,"22 ounce bottle served a few minutes out of the fridge in an old Flying Fish glass. Frothy snow-white head shows no signs of decay for many minutes, topping a bright medium-amber, slightly oily body and lacing thickly when it finally does drop away...aroma is strongly citric and moderately resinous, like the original PseudoSue, but the Mosaic addition adds a wonderful oniony-garlicy presence - wonderful of course if you like that in your beer aromas - but its subdued enough not to be overpowering, merely adding some nice complexity...on the tongue its robust, with no sign of the wateriness Ive found a couple of times right at the front of the regular version, but also enormously quaffable, with the bitterness restrained until a somewhat hard, quite acidic finish...lightly oily, carbonation rather high though not damagingly so. I think here the stronger acidity and slightly lower sweetness makes for a somewhat lesser experience for this drinker, but its still awfully solid and another credible entry in this brewerys large, excellent catalog of hop-forward libations.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
4026,"2017-04-20",4.1,"Quite similar to regular psuedosue. Hops might be a little more pungent, but hard to notice that much of a difference. It would be interesting to try this and the regular head to head. I still think King Sue takes the cake. Still very good beer, just not convinced this stands out.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
4026,"2017-04-16",4.1,"Bomber from Premier. Orange pour with a white head. Rich tropical fruit and citrus aroma and taste. Sharp hop bite. Awesome.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
4026,"2017-04-15",4.0,"Bottle at home. Pour is cloudy orange with large white head. Aroma and flavor are citrusy and fresh with a stronger resinous component than regular sue. A touch more bitter as well. Overall delicious and easy drinking.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"
4026,"2017-04-12",3.9,"3/23 bottle. 
Aroma is bright, some citrus, a bit of yeast. 
Straw colored, tiny bit of haze. 
Flavor opens sweet, then some tropical fruit, slightly bitter finish. 
Tasty beer.","Minnesota, USA","Steasy66"
4026,"2017-04-10",4.6,"Hazy gold to orange pour with a four finger, creamy to chunky off white head. Aroma is loaded with guava heavy tropical fruit, sweet biscuit, a little caramel and cereal, sweet citrus, a hint of toast and sesame and just a hint of sweet peach. Flavor is again big on guava up front, but with lots of other tropical notes, like a fruit salad, slightly underripe melon, mandarin orange, biscuit, bread and a little caramel. Light to medium body, juicy, creamy at first, medium, blanketing carbonation, slightly dry, crisp finish with a light hop acid bite. Fantastic, simply fantastic, I could drink this stuff every day.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"
4026,"2017-03-29",4.5,"Bottle on 3/23/17. Served from 22 oz. bottle into glass. Pours deep gold in color, medium clarity with vibrant white head. Huge complex hop aroma, mostly fruit; berry, mango, peach, with bubblegum and a hint pine. The fruit aroma isnt extremely citrusy but more savory and slightly earthy. Flavor is again hugely hoppy, peach and mango are even more prominent. Slightly citrus aftertaste. Very little malt character is detectable. Medium hop bitterness and a slightly dry finish. Medium body, smooth, and medium carbonation. Overall this beer is a fruity hop bomb. The aroma is complex and intriguing, full of depth and nuance. Drinking it is like taking a bite of a fresh juicy peach. The full body, mild bitterness and dry finish makes it supremely drinkable. A great expression of Mosaic hops and an overall great beer.","Wisconsin, USA","handmuffin"
4026,"2017-03-05",4.1,"Amber. Great mosaic nose with grapefruit, tropical fruit, and a hint of onion. Flavor is typical Sue with a nice malt backbone and plenty of Citra. Even better.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
4026,"2017-03-04",3.3,"Somewhat clear amber pour. Aroma has tropical fruits, citrus, slight mango and whole lot of butterscotch. Dry mouthfeel, somewhat oily texture, medium bodied. There are obvious diacetyl notes underneath. Insert sad emoji.","Reykjavik, ICELAND","haukur"
4026,"2017-02-20",4.5,"Super good beer. The aroma is kind of funky, I cant get past the idea that it smells like armpits. Flavor is fantastic just bursting with a perfect balance between The Malt and fresh Mosaic hops.. Everything is just right, the carbonation, the body, the Finish; super good drinking beer.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"
4026,"2017-02-18",4.0,"Bomber, didnt see the date. Hazy orange yellow. Very familiar sue profile, citrus and tropical fruit, with a solid malty back. Medium bitterness, mild sweetness, very drinkable. Its good, but without having it next to the regular Id say its the same.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
4026,"2017-02-15",4.3,"Really amazing aroma. Strong citrus and pineapple. Pours golden orange. Taste is pale fruit pine. I like double citra better, but this was still really good.","","phranq"
4026,"2017-02-13",4.3,"650ml bottle from the Malt Shoppe in Tosa. Orange pour with great coats of lace. Sweet juicy tropical fruits, peach. Sweet toffee malts. Smooth. Much more peachy fruity than the citrus of the base brew. Nose is not as good as the taste. Medium bodied, a touch of alcohol, blend is excellent. Finishes fruity bittersweet. Big fan - mosaic may trump the citra or whatever hop is in the original. 17","Wisconsin, USA","AWISLguy"
4026,"2016-09-30",3.9,"Oh man its rare. Great mosaic nose - super fruity, a littler green celery notes but none of the sweaty notes that come with some of these mosaic single hops. Malt base is lightly toasty a little bread and sugar. Golden orange pour, some haze but not on that chazz juice level yet. Flavors of a good deal of citrus, tropical fruit, a little green, some dank, soft malt base with light bread and balancing sweetness. Lingering chewy fruity hops. Well done, great balance, solid.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
4026,"2016-08-28",3.9,"22oz bottle thanks to Steve. Pours out a hazy cloudy golden topped with a white head. Nose is big melon juicy fruit notes and a nice cereal malt. Taste is more of the sweet melon fruit notes plenty of nice hops and a well rounded malt bill.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"
4026,"2016-08-28",3.8,"Bottle share, thanks to Steve. Was able to try this side-by-side with the base Sue, along with King Sue. Golden orange appearance with a modest sandy head. Big hop aroma, fruity and juicy citrus and tropical notes. Noticeably different flavor profile (from the base); Crisp hop taste with less sweetness, more floral and dry. Less soothing in the finish not abrasive, but noticeably a little harsh. Still drinks quite good.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"
4026,"2016-08-28",4.2,"From bomber trade with Patrick Kosciuk. Bought in Madison, WI (????). Clear golden color. Small head that quickly fades to ring. Very little lacing. Great mosaic aroma. Clean crisp flavor from the single hopping. Really good stuff.","Michigan, USA","Booga"
4026,"2016-08-11",4.2,"Consumed herein my living room.
The beer pours a pale yellow, reasonably hazy, with a big fluffy white head & good lacing on the glass.

The aroma is lots of mango & orange zest... Loads of fresh hoppiness, a little bit of dankness, a lot of melon... Sheesh.

The flavor is super bright lightly bitter & lightly sweet up front with a dry finish. Its got a pretty wide spectrum of fruity hoppiness... mango, orange, & melon. Zippy, bright, jyst delicious.

4026,"2016-08-06",4.1,"Bomber, side-by-side with a can of regular Sue. Turns out my mosaic blind spot means this is about 98% indistinguishable from the canned regular version. Appearance is similar, nose is similar (this has some tropical fruit overtones I guess, but only after its warmed a bit, and only if Im straining for it). If anything the finish is a little harsher, huskier and a shade more bitter, but Im really splitting hairs at that point. Im giving it the same rating because as far as I can tell its the same beer (but I expect my experience is anomalous).","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
4026,"2016-08-01",4.1,"22 oz. bottle from Johns Grocery. Thanks, Andy! Pours a cloudy orange gold with an inch of soft, finely fizzy white head that settles unevenly and lacs the glass heavily and sloppily. My first impression is that this has a surprisingly big punch of tea in it, with tangerine citrus, grass and straw, bready malts, melon, pineapple, pine resin, and floral zest. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a balanced mouthfeel thats clean, malty, smooth, and moderately bitter all at once. Excellent balance and depth. Lovely stuff.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
4026,"2016-07-29",3.6,"Pours a cloudy yellow with good-sized head. Aroma is full of tropical fruit and citrus. Flavors include tropical fruits, citrus, and nice fusion of hop bitterness. This is a good variation on this IPA.","Osseo, Minnesota, USA","bookman10"
4026,"2016-07-25",4.0,"Bottle thanks to Seth. Pours a hazy yellow gold with medium frothy off white head that lasts. The aroma is tropical fruit, dank, dust. Medium body, juicy, dank, pineapple, light bitterness, really nice.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
4026,"2016-07-25",4.1,"Bottle from Johns Grocery. Poured into snifter. Nose is super diesel with moderate onion. Tons of mosaic combined with citra wins this aroma. Light dank and tropical notes in the distant background. Pours a hazy orange. Small white head. Taste is initially very bitter, bordering on astringent and pith. After a couple sips a moderate malt presence tends to balance it out. A touch of bread and dough. A tad sweet from what I recall from regular sue. Finishes with some tropical notes reminiscent of citra. Onion flavor a dont come through as the aroma shows. Pretty nice variation on Sue but not sure I would buy a ton of it.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
4026,"2016-07-24",4.2,"22oz bomber. Hazy orange-tan body. Foamy, steady, off-white head. Relatively soft carbonation, gently mouthfeel. Big peachy, apricot mosaic tones, about as juicy and rich as they get in 2016. Gives Pseudosue some nice dimension for sure. I was a little more ecstatic about this one the first time I had it, maybe it was that much fresher. Peach tones come out the more as you let it warm. Quite excellent. World Class.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
4026,"2016-07-24",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2016 650 mL bottle. Hazy orange. Smells just like pseudoSue for a microsecond. Lots of citra. Then mosaic kicks in with garlic and a nice bite. Taste has a much more pungent Mosaic flavor. Orange citrus with an immediate mosaic bite. Light pale malt sweetness. Low bitterness. Delicious. Adds a nice dimension to pseudoSue.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
4026,"2016-07-22",4.1,"Aroma is Mosaic hops, pine and very spicy. The flavor is citrus, Mosaic hops/hop resin,, cracker-like malts and a spicy/lightly bitter finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
4026,"2016-07-19",4.1,"Huh. So this beer is quite good. Big tropical fruit in the nose, a touch of rotting papaya, a bit of diesel. It has just enough bitterness. Its light bodied. The carbonation is pretty much on point as you get. For new world pales, this is one of the best ones Ive had in a few years.","@ $13.99, Iowa, USA","DietPepsican"
4026,"2016-07-18",4.1,"Bottle. Pours quite hazy golden, large puffy off white head, dissipates slowly with clumpy lacing. Aroma is really nice tropical, dank, passionfruit, guava, mango, pot.
