Growler opened with a satisfying burst of carbonation.

Pours a beautiful copper color with a thin 1/2"" white head. Crystal clear with appropriate level of carbonation.  Good balance of earthy hops and sweet malt in the aroma. Nothing overpowering - just a really nice balance.  I expected this to be a little more hop forward, but this wasnt at all disappointing. Flavor has a good amount of bitterness, and a nice balance of fruity malt. When first poured, I detected a slight bubble gum flavor that was interesting and not unappealing. As the beer warmed in the glass a little, this disappeared.  Solid body, maybe slightly on the thin side, but appropriate for an IPA.  Extremely drinkable. I could have these all night long. Nothing is overpowering here - alcohol is detectable, but restrained. Malt and hops in perfect balance.  Balance is the key word for this beer.

Aroma is awfully subdued, with some glimmers of orange, fresh ground chile (the fruitiness, sans the pungency) and herbs (mostly mint).

Prickly pine, resinous, nectarine, citrus syrups, some darker creamy malts keep things in balance. This beers got quite a nose on it.

Smooth on the tongue considering the strong coniferous element. Orange peel bitterness, aggressive hop presence that somehow manages to avoid hindering the overall drinkability. Delicious. The body is a bit thin but that doesnt take much away from an otherwise spectacular beer.

3889,"2012-02-27",3.4,"From notes.  First reviewed 6/21/2010.  Poured 6/19 from a growler filled on 6/17 into a pint glass.

Masala Mama has a very dark appearance for an IPA, a dark copper color with a fluffy off-white head. Good head retention, and nice sticky lace is all over the glass.

The aroma is hoppy, but less than I would have expected. Earthy and pine notes predominate, but there are citrus notes as well. The malt aroma is bready.

The flavor is very balanced, but I felt it was missing something. The bready malt was soft, the pine and earthy hops were subtle. The grapefruit flavor was really the only flavor to push through strongly. Finished mildly bitter.

It has a pleasantly creamy feel, with slightly above average carbonation. Not much residue remains from the hop oil.

This was a quaffable brew with a nice smoothness, but there was nothing that really catapulted this over the top. Although I am glad I was fortunate enough to try it, I will not go crazy to seek it out again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

3889,"2011-03-07",3.3,"From notes:

Growler received in a past trade with a generous MN guy. Shared with kubrick215 and a non-BA friend.

Pours a hazy dark golden orange with burnt orange hues when held to a light and a two finger frothy, pillowy off-white head. Excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that coats the glass with rings, streaks and splotches of soapy lacing.

As soon as the growler was opened you could smell the dank, resinous oily hops from across the room. Very earthy and floral with a lots of pine and sticky kind bud character dominating the nose. Theres also a good amount of sweet citrus and tropical fruit. Hints of pineapple, mango, grapefruit and citrus rind. Subtle malts with hints of sweet alcohol and biscuit.

Chewy full body with a blast of dry, bitter hops that linger throughout into a long, dry finish. More one-dimensional than the aroma suggests with an overpowering dry, earthy pine flavor. Slightly floral but mostly just intensely bitter and dry. Kind of like eating a tree. Resinous, sticky and oily with the dryness just coating the tongue in an unpleasant way. This really hurts the mouthfeel and drinkability. Not much in the way of sweetness to balance things out. The tropical and citrus fruit notes from the aroma are minimal if not completely absent. Its hard to pick anything else out underneath the dry, earthy pine needles. Faint malt backbone but again not enough to balance things out much. Subtle hits of caramel, biscuit and graham cracker.

Overall, Im happy I got to try this beer but it was just too one-dimensional for my liking. I love intense bitter hoppy beers but this beer coats the tongue in an unpleasant way and reminds we of having cotton mouth after smoking low grade weed back in college.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

In fairness, this growler had been opened the previous day. Pours deep reddish orange, little head but respectable lacing. Nose - some pine and a strong citrus aroma, especially orange zest and some grapefruit. There is a good dose of bready, sweet malt evident, but nicely so. This is a well-balanced IPA, but maybe tilted toward the malts. Citrusy hops at the outset and in mildly dry finish. Carbonation seemed to fit, although lighter than expected. Mouthfeel was medium and creamy. The malt forward, almost no head, little observed carbonation, etc. were probably due to some lack of freshness but this was still an outstanding beer.

3889,"2010-04-26",4.7,"A- Body is a slightly translucent, dark rusty orange/amber color. Pours with a giant frothy, foamy off-white head. The growler was almost a gusher but stopped as soon as it reached the top and didnt overflow at all. Head eventually subsides to 1/2 finger and has perfect retention from there with lots of lacing left in the glass. When held up to the light one can see that it is nearly transparent with a very minimal uniform fogginess to the body.

S- Nose is deceptively sweet with a big presence of caramel malt being the highlight. Sweet citrus (grapefruit) hops arise next and there is just a touch of pine and earthiness also detectable. This doesnt have the scent of a big crazy West Coast hop bomb, but rather of a balanced IPA or red ale where the hops are definitely not the main character.

T-The flavor is huge all the way through. It begins with a balance of pine and citrus hop flavors upfront with a very substantial sweet caramel malt backbone. The finish starts out pretty sweet with the caramel malt coming through...just then a blast of pine flavor and bitterness comes through at the very end. What lingers is a medium residual piny bitterness along with a refreshing piny aftertaste.

P-Medium to high tingly carbonation with a very nice smooth oily body. Mouthfeel is light in weight.

O- This IPA is magnificent, brilliant! Minneapolis might just be the home of my favorite IPA. I love how the smell is so deceptively sweet then the flavor is like ""just kidding-Im pretty much a hop bomb."" Very pleased with this and happy that i have a whole growler of it to enjoy! (No one else around likes hoppy beers). This has the flavor of a DIPA packed into a regular IPA with a lower ABV. Wonderful indeed. Would have been the perfect beer if it just had a bit more citrus. It did land a spot in my all time top 10 favorite beers though!

Growler with BBD 6/4 . Poured into the Duvel tulip...cap pops with a nice little fizz....

Pours a honey/butterscotch/copper/bourbon color with a sourdough/eggshell head - about 1 finger that drops down to about ½. Decent lacing...a little chill haze on the body. Sparse carbonation rises with moderate speed.

Lots of hops...Nugget/Amarillo/Chinook? I dunno, but its fresh and absolutely wonderful. Very nice bitterness here. Quite subtle, but quite clean. Malt is there too - a little spicy caramel here. Light-bodied and very enjoyable.

This is a little different. Its not a caricature grapefruit hop bomb like many other IPAs (not that theres anything wrong with that), although the Beautiful Bride does note that its like drinking a fresh clean grapefruit with a little Sprite-ly character. Its clean, its refreshing and the balance on this is absolutely huge. The hops show off more than grapefruit citrus...theres flora...a little pine...it tastes like very fresh pellet hops or hop oils. The malt is mild in the balance with a slight caramel hint. This doesnt rate high for an overpowering taste; its simply extremely even-keeled.

Theres absolutely nothing wrong with how this hits the palate. Hop character with a little pucker? Yup. Solid malt backbone thats not heavy? Sure thing. Clean finish with no aftertaste? Oh yeah. Maintains its bountiful yet balanced character throughout, leaving an extremely fulfilling and long finish behind? Uh huh.

This is one I didnt expect to experience for a very long time. Trading is a thing of beauty. KeefD - thanks much. And this deal drinks so cleanly its not funny, but it reminds you there is some meat on the bone. This growler doesnt have much of a life expectancy at the moment and I fully intend to induce and enjoy every bit of its rapid demise. 

Another note: This is not a great beer because it overpowers the senses like a sledgehammer; its good because its extremely well-constructed, balanced, clean and a full-bodied pleasure to enjoy. I had similar sentiments with a reasonably fresh bottle of Ithaca TEN; this even more so. Something to sit back and enjoy without full frontal assault. So well done.

Fresh growler poured into a standard pint glass produced a finger worth of creamy looking head that settled to a thick lace that slides down the glass as you drink it. The body of the brew is a clear somewhat amber copper in color, with tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass.

The aroma hit me as soon as I opened the growler it is an incredible citric smell that wafts threw the air. I put my nose into the glass and it only gets better nice pine and floral hops come into my head making the drinking experience even better. The flavor is well balanced the way I like my IPAs there is enough sweetness from the malts to keep the hops bitter in check. Dont get me wrong there is enough bitterness in this but, the sweetness makes you come back for more and more of this wonderful nectar. The body of the brew is medium in my mouth with great carbonation for my tongue even from a growler.

The appearance is yellow slightly hazed with a good head that lingered around the entire time.

The nose is that of slight pine, citrus, lemongrass. alot of the things you expect in a solid IPA.

This beer has a lot of hype behind it and is rated on BA as the top IPA. It is well deserving of this. Although not as balanced as the alesmith IPA it is certainly damn good.

The mouth feel. this hit with a tingle that starts out slow then emerges on the back end. Its almost like a light pale ale then when you finish the bite comes in so slightly.

This is a beer that even the hop haters would love.

3889,"2009-01-22",5.0,"In short: An incredibly intense small IPA focussing of intense foresty dry bitterness.  Very tasty dry.  A fantastic beer.  My desert Island American hops fix.
How: Growler, a million thanks to oakbuff (Scott) for this unexpected gem.  Drank fresh the day I received it
The look: Clear shinning golden copper body topped by a medium off-white head
In long: Enchanting strong nose of resinous and foresty hops.  A very big body for such a small IPA.  The toasty caramelized malts sweetness are quickly taken over by a very tasty intense bitterness and a surprisingly dry finish.  Very resinous with coniferous bark.  The pine tree flavour is very dry and feels like chewing on dried pine needles with the juice sucked out.  Very light on the fruity side with only hints of dried fruit peels (orange, citrus).  A little fluffy and dusty.  The dryness of this IPA is off the chart.  This beer is more intense than most 9% Imperial IPAs but is more refreshing and highly drinkable.  Clearly one of the best hop-fix Ive ever had and without any doubt the best below 7% hop-fix I have had.  It may not have the intensity of the best IIPAs out there (Dreadnaught, etc.) but I cannot think of an American (I)IPA Id like to drink more often.  As much as I love the stronger IIPAs if I had to chose only one American hoppy beer to drink for the rest of my life it would be this one.  Hence the perfect score.  Too bad its only available on tap.  Growlers are expensive to ship and shipping price from USA is proportional to the weight.

The nose is really fruity, with abundant bitter hops in there to be sure, but floral and inviting in a big way. The taste is far more bitter, resinous in certain places, in a way that complements the full bodied mouthfeel quite nicely, keeping it from being too chewy. Spice, a touch of mint, fruits coming back to close it out. Man, this stuff is great.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

the smell is perfect on this beer. the smell is very sweet and hoppy. which is quite odd as none of the sweetness translated in the taste. 

this is a great tasting ipa, although im not a huge fan of ipas in general. the taste was bitter and hoppy. hops hops hops. it literally took the middle of my tongue and just bent it up towards the top of my mouth.

Im getting the chance to try this thanks to a great trade with mully, thanks Matt! Masala Mama pours a slighty hazy copper with streams of carbonation bubbles rising to the surface. That carbonation helps keep the incredibly dense sticky head going throughout the session. Two fingers worth of off white head was produced on the pour and quickly became meringue like and left great webbed lacing. This is the best lacing Ive come across in quite some time!

Biscuity and caramel malts greet the nose right up but an earthy citric hoppiness quickly comes forward. Sweetened grapefruit and orange pith are the culprits. Combined with the dry biscuitiness the hopping makes for an enjoyable nose for sure. Each swirl of the glass brings alive the aroma.

When colder theres a buzzsaw of bitter sprucey hoppiness right down the middle of the tongue, which is actually how I prefer things. As it warms the caramel and biscuity malts catch up to the hoppy bitterness and bring a bit more balance. The spucey, risinous hoppiness does try and run roughshod but the malt just barely holds on. I wasnt expecting such a hop blast and Im glad I got it. This is my style of IPA without a doubt!

The body is medium in viscosity and the carbonation gives a light texture on the tongue. The carbonation seems pretty lively in the mouth and awakens the tastebuds which seems to intensify the hoppy bitterness. 

This IPA goes down without a problem. Big on flavor with a low enough abv to enjoy all night long. I cant remember coming across a beer in this abv range with such a bold bitterness.

Masala Mama is, without a doubt, a very well crafted beer. I actually prefer it colder than usual. This helps the bitter hoppiness come through boldly compared to when it warms and a caramel earthy maltiness make more of a play.

3889,"2008-03-29",4.0,"Aroma is mostly of tropical fruits with a bit of citrus hop bitterness and definite malt sweetness. The appearance is quite nice for the style, a deep copper with a solid head that leave some nice lacing. The flavor is fantastic- the tropical fruit comes through again, and is really unlike anything Ive ever tasted before. Pineapple bitter/sweetness throughout the flavor. the palate is solid - creamy and smooth with a bit of tingly carbonation. Overall a very nice, pretty unique take on the IPA style. Excellent beer.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","crowderm"

3889,"2008-03-17",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 19, 2008 Pint pour, at the brewpub in Minneapolis.  Pour is clear amber, with an off white head.  About an inch, and quite lasting.  The remnants of the head streaked the glass nicely.  Aroma of floral and citrus hops up front, with some nice sweet toasted maltiness in the back.  Taste is much more balanced towards the hops - very fresh, almost wet tasting citrus (grapefruit) and floral.  Nice bitterness from tip of the tongue to the back of the throat.  The malt is in the middle in finish, though certainly takes a back seat to the hops.  The palate was surprisingly thin, and led to this being a bot on the watery side.  An excellent IPA.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
3889,"2008-02-25",3.7,"Bottle at the Laid Back Brussels Tasting (Feb 9, 2008)Clear amber, off-white, fizzy head.  Aroma is heavily on the american hops (even quite one dimensional on these) inducing also some flowery aromas.  Some malty aromas of caramel are present too. Heavily hoppy bitter, lightly sweet flavour.  The flavour is quite heavy on the hops as well, but the balance nor complexity arent well looked after.  Nice but not great, too one dimensional.","Aarschot, BELGIUM","diabel"
3889,"2008-02-20",4.8,"poured from a growler into a pint glass, thanks to LordSloth for the trade (consumed: 2/15/08)

A: Pours a beautiful, rich copper with a fast-rising creamy off-white head that lasts forever and a day and immediately begins to leave sticky spiderweb lacing. The beers clarity is also worth nothing, I could read a novel through this if I wasnt so preoccupied with getting it into my belly.

S: Mmmm...hops! My best guess is Cascade or Centennial, or a combination of the both of them, as pine & citric grapefruit scents are dominant. Not to be outdone though, there is a very nice cookie/bread malt character here as well.

T/M: I was expecting to be smashed in the taste buds with hops right up front, but an unexpected initial burst of sweet bready malts begins the journey, then followed by a smack of bitter citric hops, with a deliciously bitter grapefruit finish. Perfect levels of carbonation make this seem like a cream soda, the oils from the hops coat the tongue and leave your palate wanting more.

D: All I will say is that I wish like hell I had this beer available to me 24/7. Highest recommendation.","Wood Ridge, New Jersey, USA","markgugs"
3889,"2008-02-13",3.5,"From a growler shipped over the Atlantic and tasted just in time. Pours dark-amber, looks OK, but the nose is awesome: brown-sugary and floral-hoppy.

3889,"2008-02-04",4.1,"Truly a top notch IPA. Of all the times Ive been to Town Hall and of all the Masala Ive had over the years, it saddens me to think that Ive never rated it. Well... here goes. From a freshly filled growler. Excellently balanced. Pine, bitter orange zest is unison with caramel and toasted biscuit malt on the nose and palate. Some cedar, perfume and soap as well. Pours a dark, hazy, thick copper with a head that lasts forever and leaves excellent lacing. Medium to full bodied. Slightly sticky but never cloying. A lasting zesty, bitter finish. This one never disappoints.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
3889,"2008-01-26",4.7,"From the growler.

Pours an amber copper color, with a thick and dense head that cascades upwards for several seconds after the pour is completed. The off-white head sticks around forever and the lacing leaves a series of rings around the glass.

Strong pine in the aroma, some citrusy notes, floral hops, caramel.

This beer has a strong malt profile which in most other IPAs would be too much competition for the hops, but here the pine resin barrels right through the caramel sweetness and smacks you around. A little orange/grapefruit in the hop profile as well. Really bold and full but still well balanced.

The carbonation is perfect here. This is a big IPA but its not too syrupy. Youd think theres more alcohol judging by the big maltiness but its a very modest 5.9%. If I hadnt split the growler with a friend Im sure I would have no trouble finishing it solo. Top notch IPA.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

3889,"2007-12-24",4.4,"Pours a ruby copper with a huge creamy head that stick around and laces for days. Damn this looks good and already is obviously not your average IPA. Smells of huge hops, grapefruit, a hint of peach, pine, HOPS!! First taste is insane. I just took a Bruce Lee kick of hops to the tastebuds. Ive had weaker DIPAs. Some grapefruit, rind, intese citrus, pine and the most hops Ive ever had in an IPA. This is crazy good. I had no idea what I was getting till now. Feels medium to light in the mouth with carbonation tickling the tongue in a great way. Finishes puckeringly bitter and slightly dry. Wow, hopheads beware. One taste of this beauty and you will have your bags packed for Minneapolis. This breaks the rules of IPA in so many different ways.

3889,"2007-12-23",4.6,"Enjoyed on cask.

Pours a magnificent dark orange color with an amazing creamy head. The lacing left little rings all the way around the glass, never seen lacing like that, it was a sight to see. Smell had hints of biscuit and caramel, but of course they were hidden behind a vast array of strong citrus hoppiness. Taste was very good as well and even had a bit of a cream like flavor mixed with the citrus and pine. Mouthfeel was full bodied and ridiculously smooth, this could be drank all day if you wanted, this was truly a great experience.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"
3889,"2007-12-23",4.8,"When poured it has a cloud, not unlike a guiness, then it becomes crisp with a great foamy head that doesnt fall and a lacing thats unbelieveably stuck. It has a golden orange color.

The smell is strong and elegant with fruity tones. The malty tones are creamy and soft. The smell is very strong.

The taste is creamy and flavorful, bready and fruity with a hoppy aftertaste that isnt invasive. I tasted a little wateryness, but unsure if thats just a cask conditioned ale.

3889,"2007-03-21",3.8,"16 oz. pour from the tap at Town Hall. Lemon/citrus, milky aroma of Pacific Northwest hops. Pours a largely clear (although there is a hint of haze), deep amber with a moderate amount of uneven beige head and extensive lacing. Malty sweet, floral, buttery, citrus-hoppy flavor. Barely any bitterness, except in the strong aftertaste. Good, but sweeter and less bitterly harsh than I desire from my IPAs. Full-bodied, fluffy, lively, and smooth in the palate. Fantastic texture. Easy to drink. Masala Mama is a very good beer, but I prefer more meanness from my pale ales. It did make a great match to my spicy hummus pizza (which was much better than it sounds).","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Taste. Hops. Citrus - yes. But also floral and just a bit spicy. There is a subtle maltiness that is a bit sweet. Probably just sweet enough to balance those lovely floral citrus HOPS!!! It is bitter, yes, but also fruity and floral and spicy enough not to be dominated by the bitterness. The maltiness is there. It is prevelant, and can stand on its own, but for this number - it is willing to be the rhythm section backing up the brass and lead guitar of the hops.  Nice full bodied mouthfeel. The hops (with grapefruit and all of the subtle variations) lingers.","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"

Smell; lots of pine tree going on in here with some grapefruit, oranges and lemons all thrown as well. Theres a nice bready, almost caramel malt presence in the background. As this warms the citrus aromas become much more pronounced.

Taste; The pine needle hops are very present in the flavor, as they are in the aroma, but the citrus is a bit more dominant. Grapefruit and orange peels, as well as a bit of lemons all come out after the pine needles followed by a nice caramel and bready presence.

Mouthfeel/Drinkability; the mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, and seems the fit the hop profile of the just about perfectly, and the drinkability is just incredible.

This was my final sample.  Im glad as it turned out to also be the best even though I did not get a chance to try the cask version (which is supposed to be even better).  There is a very good reason that this is one of the highest ranked IPAs on the site.  I still have to give the nod to a handful of others but this stacks up well against most everything.  Make sure you finish off the night with this or you will regret it later.
Aroma / Appearance - A resiny pine nose is followed by toffee and butterscotch.  When I close my eyes I am taken to a walk through a blue fir stand on a cool winter night.  The body is an amber color with a head about one-finger high.
Flavor / Palate - Sharp resin and pine needles permeated the first sip.  A strong bitterness comes next.  Soon after a nice complex set of caramel, honey and maple syrup.  The sweetness offsets the hoppiness well.  On the whole this is extremely well balanced and easy to drink.

3889,"2006-08-14",4.9,"Sampled on-cask at the brewery on July 3rd, 2005...

On my visit to the legendary Town Hall Brewery, I was expecting nothing short of the best from this beer.  IPAs are my favorite style, so I figured I had better try the beer some label as the ""best"" IPA in the world. Well, I can honestly say that after trying it, it set the bar....and set the bar pretty damn high.

I was lucky enough to sample this legendary concoction in its purest form...on-cask, at the brewery. Also, considering the ridiculous hype that surrounds this beer, I was amazed with how impressed I really was. Out of the hand-pump, the bubbles cascade beautifully up & down in the hazy orange brew. When it finally settles down, the head sits proudly atop a beer that essentially looks like perfection in a glass. The aroma from this brew is incredible...as rich and aromatic as any IPA Ive ever had. The lacing is the best Ive seen on a beer to date..entire rings of sticky lacing form on every sip...Ive never seen anything quite like it before. Then theres the taste..how many hop varieties they use, I do not know...but whatever the recipe is, I want it. Not too bitter, not too sweet..just perfectly well-balanced and smooth. Im sure being on-cask helped with the smoothness, but Ive never had a beer that went down as good as this one did. Its just a damn good thing I dont live in Minneapolis, thats all I have to say.","Iowa, USA","hero27"
3889,"2006-08-03",3.3,"Woodsy aroma, amber color with normal head. Flavor is huge pine and grapefruit, with a bracingly bitter finish. I could stand a good deal more malt to balance this one out.

3889,"2006-08-01",3.6,"On tap at the brewery, August 2006.  Lovely, translucent and golden chestnut in color with a sudsy, khaki-tan pocked head that could host a head retention clinic.  Cool to the touch, and when the nose passes by, we discern emissions of fresh cotton and a hint of freshly bathed puppy.  Grassy phenols couple with pine bark and embark on a northern Midwestern nature center hiking trail adventure.  Rustic hop activity and copper entrapment tie up the loose ends of the nose, to a fault.  Flavor kicks in with ripe and oppressive hops.  Carbonation errs on the side of caution while an invigorating English toffee tune takes hold.  Bright, light hop alpha acids duel with the buttered rum backdrop.  Salient malt display, though the moderately caramelized malt and native English yeast esters arent in full agreement.  Pumped up pumpernickel helps to summarize the spiciness.  Alcohol hotness gains perpetual motion.  Light aridness indicates bitterness at the tongues tip.  Citric aggression doesnt exactly meld with the buttery toffee belly, though the finish leaves a formidable wanton spruce caramel cube composure.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Rich, creamy, resinous, medium bodied mouthfeel.  The fruity hop dimensions are mellowed out by a tasty green pepper spice and some woody coconut bark.  The fruity red fruits and some orange tones sweeten up the palate a bit, but the citrusy grapefruit notes are plentiful enough to quench my hop craving.

Day-old Grolwer. 

Excellent pour. Very dark for the style, like overbrewed tea. Dark orange on top, lighter near the middle. Sun sparkles through. Ahh…midday Sunday. Huge foamy white spiderweb head. It dies down to a respectable quarter inch that sticks around for the duration of the pint and leaves great lacing behind. 

Smells like citrus hops and a solid malt background. Resinous, pine and orange, bitter. Its good, but not particularly strong or complex for an American IPA.

Taste hits you like a jackhammer. Intensely bitter hops start with pine, move into flowers, then grapefruit and orange, get a kick of sweet near the middle, and end on an absolutely perfect caramel malt finish. Like a good translation of a Greek poem: to the point, brisk, and perfectly balanced. Youre amazed that something says so much in so short a time.

3889,"2005-11-18",4.8,"From the Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery located in the Twin Cities, this growler came to me via BA feloniousmonk.  The seal had obviously held up, as the beer came out with a nicely swirling fine carbonation forming a lace bearing eggshell white head, which was thin, but rich.  The beer itself was rather clear, with an attractive copper amber color, which was a shade darker than the run of the mill IPA.  The aroma was very good at the time of the pour, and got better as the beer warmed up.  The smell was that of flowery, spicy, and citric hops, that were strong without being over the top.  The sweet honeysuckle smell of the underlying malt base was permitted to shine through faintly as well.

Taste was unabashedly bitter and peppery with no qualms about the hyper hopped nature of the drink.  The malts were caramel, and only there to prop up the hop fireworks going on in my mouth.  I love when a brewer self assuredly brews a beer to take its rightful place in the world, and this is a mighty example of this.  The soft tropical mouthfeel, dry palette, and leafy bitter aftertaste, all go on paint a cohesive and harmonious picture.  I no longer thought a single IPA could wow me, but this one does.

Given my reluctance to rate growlers that have been shipped across the country, Im hesitant to rate this beer.  But it has only taken one sniff and then one sip to quickly abandon that philosophy in this case.  Wow, this is a great IPA!  Flavorful and well-balanced, this has good, solid malt body for an IPA.  Moderately sweet with light caramel flavor is balanced by grapefruity and moderately bitter hops.  Lots of tea and chalk flavor throughout, and a bit of alcohol in there as well.  The wonderfully aromatic and well-balanced nose shows much malt, tea, hops and citrus.  Medium ""plus"" body, round and chalky mouthfeel, a long and pleasantly bitter aftertaste, very nice.  Despite coming from a growler, the carbonation is perfect.  The body is ruddy amber in color and slightly hazy.  The creamy, light tan head pours to an inch and takes about ten minutes to settle to a filmy layer -- pretty impressive for a shipped growler.

Fully malty nose offers a broad range of varied dark malts aromas, caramel and fitting butterscotch being omnipresent. Strong biscuity feel. The hops, in that regard, are not the prime focus, but just a half of the couple, procuring mostly earthy, anise-like notes that evolve into leafiness in mouth. Quite sweet for an IPA, obviously rather round, more citric in mouth than the nose would let know and definitely less fruity. Expertly hidden alcohol and no astringency join forces to explain the desirable reputation. Reminds me of stuff like Nogne O Batch 100 for its sheer barleywineish malt orientation.

3889,"2005-08-22",3.0,"Bitterness in the right place, hop flavor and body off the mark for my tastes.   it tasted like it was too heavy on the high alpha-acid bittering hop side, and not enough on the flavoring/dry-hopped side.  Add more unfermentable dextrins into the mash and a bit less bittering IBU and trade that for more lower AA% IBU.  This is one of my favorite styles, but I dont think this style is the brewerys specialty.  The 1800 was much better.","Oakland, California, USA","nahthan"

Masala Mama was the last beer I sampled before leaving the grounds, a good manner of parting. This is one of the more nicely balanced IPAs between the citrus (predominately grapefruit) and the pine (which reminded me of blue spruce). That being said, its not the finest IPA out there.

Ample lacing is left and the beer is unfiltered with a magenta-orange-amber appearance and a yellowish head, nice and creamy.  Ive been wondering about this beer for some time now and wow did it deliver.  Aroma is fresh hop juice, BUT not too bitter.  More candied oranges, sweet caramel and toffee, peaches, cream, vanilla, light hints of grapefruit.  Big and juicy.  Flavor is even better than the aroma, IMO.  Full body immediately delivers the malt, rich, creamy and moderately sweet, the caramel, toffee and honey all provide ample balance to the citric, juicy hops.  While the hops and malt are nothing new, they are just so gloriously executed and the body and mouthfeel lacks nothing, or so I thought.  Creamy smooth, with tingly carbonation and a finishing bitterness that almost goes too far, in my book, but not quite.  Bit of pine acidity on the finish, brings back memories of the old DFH 90 minute, before they started filtering it.  Almost a green hops flavor, like Amherst IPA.  Juicy and fruity, creamy and malty, with natural carbonation.  I cant ask for much more out of an AIPA.  Thanks so much Rob, this kicked ass!

Orange/amber color which pours a nice head with heavly lacing.  Scent was more fruity than floral.  The taste was somewhat grapefruit, pine needles.  Not as citrusy as Two Hearted Ale, a bit more malt flavor.  Damn good beer.  Looks like my son will have a stop on the way home from his visits up north.

3889,"2005-03-10",4.8,"I had this at a tasting I blindly stumbled upon over the labor day weekend. This was poured from half gallon growler into a wine tasting glass. The color was a nice rich amber with a very decent head and carb bubble. The nose was staggeringly good. The hops came through piney and earthy with a citrusy grapefruit background. I had to actually stop myself from smelling it to taste it. The flavor matched the nose very well. The piney hop took center stage, supported with a sweet grapefruit backdrop. The hop flavor didnt linger, but instead, the aftertaste was sweet and mellow. This was a thick feeling beer, but just about where I wanted it for what it is. Unfortunately for me, I was actually dressed for and on my way to a wedding so I only had the one small sample glass, but I could easily have taken the growler with me and sat in the back of the church annointing myself with this most holy beverage.

3889,"2004-11-14",4.0,"Pours a hazy full copper color that has some amber notes to it.  The beer is well carbonated and forms a giant pale tan head.  The aroma is all hops with notes of grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, and pine.  Basically this has a proto-typical fruity American hop nose to it, as I sniff some more I might just sense some malt here as well.

This has a very nice flavor to it, it is light on the palate, yet packed with flavor.  It is lightly sweet in the middle, which helps to accentuate the citrus-fruit hop notes.  This beer is eminently drinkable, it is not too heavy and I could easily drink a few pints of this (for instance 64oz of it).  This beer has great notes of tangerine, ruby-red-grapefruit, orange, and hints of apricot and lemon.  What a simple wonderful beer, this beer is all about the hops, yet it has enough subtle malt notes that this is not just an astringent hop juice.  The malt is here it just supports and accentuates the hoppiness.  This is certainly eminently drinkable, and though quite hoppy still quite balanced for an IPA.  There is nothing new or unique here flavor wise, but that is not the point of this beer.  As every IPA should be this is a mouthful of an American hop celebration, that just keeps on rocking from start to lingering finish.  This beer is a nice easy drinking, eminently quaffable, hopaliscious beer that I am quite happy to have a growler of.

Aroma has more going on than most I(1)PA's. Yeah it's got the typical citrusy hops and crisp notes that your average IPA has, but it does have more of them. What sets this one apart from other IPA's I've had is the notes of cinnamon and nutmeg that are hanging out just above the surface. Slightly bready too so its like a snickerdoodle cookie, or a sweet dessert bread smothered in fresh citrus fruit. Wonderful stuff.

The flavor comes through with some great clean crisp citrus fruit and fruit rinds, but that isn't what impresses me. What impresses me is the bready backbone that pushes the flavor and accelerates it.

This isn't what I expected when I went to try it, no way.

This isn't a brew that is satisfied with showing off with all kinds of hops, no she's balanced, she's hip, she's got more going on than you thought she did when you ordered her.

Some sticky sweet malty bits show up in the aroma, but when this is in your hands, smell the hops.  Deep profound bitterness, yet doesn't come across too sharply.

3889,"2003-07-07",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2005 fresh growler:
Softly dulled bronze color, with a fine and firm capping of ivory hued foam. Head grows consistent and vigorously to a fine foam of puff. Gets bumby and moon-surfaced as it crumbles down slowly. Keeps a fine hazey skim and a load of thickly set lacing closer to the top of the liquid as the rest from towards the top is placed in light webby strings.

Now Ive had a super fresh batch in the past and the aroma first off the tap was awesomely peachy and loaded with hoppy goodness. This time around the aroma has been softened by alot from what I know what its capable of. So for now, I lower my number due to its softer touch. Gotta go with ya got. Still quite pungent though, just not as peachafied as those first tappings. What I do like is its fine crispness, very sharp and lofty with a big toasty malt showing its side of things on this day. The rest is made up of some very fresh pine thats fairly resinous. Tinges of orange sweep up along with a few bits of grapefruit and partailly heated hop dust.

The taste is what Ive come to love about this beer. Supurb cleanness, carefully bittered, well balanced, citric and toasty. Those fresher batches tend to bring out the peach tones alot more, as does the cask offering, but this still rocks my world. Lovely toastyness, creamy, soft, caramel is slippery within. Buttery biscuits among the toasted stuff. But those hops really just make a nice accompanyment and entice the buds into a ballet of tongue dancing delight. Well placed and quite pungent pine resin grabs with an intense but evenly handled bite with great nuances of citrus tones leading into heavier orange and slighter grapefruit rinds and juices. This time around - very, very slight hint of peach in the creamier areas in the middle where the toasty stuff floats off. But other times Ive had this the peach has really pushed forward as the dominate fruit and I love that even more then what it is now. Still... this....This is quite tasty.

Body is nearly full, great crispyness; clean, toasty, creamy in the middle, bittered with juicy citrus and pine, but not overloaded so as to burn the tonsils out the back of your throat. Its feverant, but mellowingly bittered. And as always, way to drinkable. So much so, this could possible be liquid crack for some folks out there. And as Hugey states, I too have yet to recieve a faultered pint full or growler full of this stuff. The peach tones werent as present this time around, but when it does, it just adds another wave of magic to this already fantastic IPA.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
3889,"2003-06-20",3.8,"Cloudy orange with medium beige head.  Aroma is floral hoppy, spicy (coriander), mildly sweet, hint of grapefruit.  Tastewise, the grapefruit overwhelms all else, though a bit of pine is noticeable.  Medium/full body.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"

3889,"2002-08-03",3.6,"A good representative of an  uncomplex but full-flavored IPA.  Bounds of flavor; floral, hoppy aroma, some spiciness.  Very drinkable.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
3889,"2002-05-22",2.8,"Amber color.  Slight fruity smell, taste dominated by cascade hops.  Pretty much your average brewpub IPA.","Mountain View, California, USA","AceOfHearts"
3889,"2002-05-15",4.1,"Masala Mama greets you with a rich, fruity, hoppy aroma. It is full-flavored; bitter but not too sharp and not too floral. As with most of the Town Halls brews, Masala Mama is served at a temperature slightly above the norm, which brings out the robust flavors of its beers. A very nice offering.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
