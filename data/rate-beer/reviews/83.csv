83,"2017-06-03",3.9,"Ah, the memories of autumn get togethers with family: Candied sweet potatoes baking in the oven and filling the house with smells of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice; cooled pumpkin pies, chocolate rum cakes, and other desserts stacked in odd, out-of-the-way places, and which lend their aromas to the house; drunk uncles shouting at sports on the TV. All came flooding back with a few sips of Elysian Dark OThe Moon.

A lot of cinnamon and nutmeg hits as you bring the pint up for a sip. Tastes strongly of cinnamon and nutmeg too, as well as chocolate; its a little overpowering at first, but it doesnt take any effort to have a second, third, or fourth quaff. The pumpkin is less noticeable, but present, and there is also a hint of earthy flavors in the finish. Overall, the flavors balance very nicely here.

My only negative: Its not much of a session beer. One pint was enough for me, sort of like one piece of pumpkin pie or chocolate rum cake, or one magic trick from your inebriated uncle during half time.","JAPAN","japancottrer"

Unfortunately, Id already sat on it too long. 2015 vintage. Pours a dark coffee brown, nearly opaque, with a moderate beige head that settles into a ring and a bridge of film. Notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, roasted and toasted malts, dark chocolate, and tobacco. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a spicy, toasty, roasty mouthfeel. Lingering roast finish with mellow spice. Its dipped a little bit but held up surprisingly well. I gave it a couple benefit of the doubt points because the age is my fault and it didnt take too hard a squinting to see what its like in top condition.

83,"2016-11-23",4.1,"22 oz bottle with a packaging date of 14 Sept. 2016 served in goblet. Pours essentially black with a modest size tan head that soon reduces to a ring. Near minimal lacing. 

Delicious, bready aroma with cinnamon and faint signs of other spices. The flavor follows but does not have quite as much cinnamon as the aroma suggests. The flavor contains notes of cinnamon, brown bread, nutmeg, vanilla, baked pumpkin, and brown sugar, with faint coffee and chocolate. Lightly sweet but neutral by the aftertaste.

The pumpkin spice is actually much more tame and balanced in the taste with a really nice vegetal pumpkin flavor coming through. This is followed by a roasted and charred malt flavor that gives a nice balance to the slight sweetness in the body.  This evolves into a dark/bittersweet chocolate flavor.

Roasted dark malt aroma with roasted pumpkin seed and autumnal spices. Pumpkin sweetness is minimal with more of a roasted seed character along with cinnamon, brown sugar, allspice, clove and nutmeg. slightly smokey/meaty with hints of dark chocolate cake, coffee bean, toast and molasses. Smells really good with a nice balance if roast, sweetness and spice. 

Full bodied with a deeply roasted presence that overpowers the subtle pumpkin presence. This is nicely complimented by the zesty spice notes but its slightly acrid and in desperate need of some sweetness. Very dry to the point of almost tasting burnt with charred dark malt flavors, toast and espresso bean along with cinnamon, clove, allspice and pepper. Very one-dimensional with hardly any pumpkin flavor to speak of. I would have never guessed that there was any in there, it just tastes like a spicy, overly roasted stout.

83,"2015-09-11",3.7,"Pours dark and opaque with medium mocha head that leaves a ring of skim.
Fantastic nose of pie fresh from the oven, vanilla ice cream melting on a warm slice, while brandy is added to fruitcake batter and put in to bake.
If only they could have captured that in the glass. The palate is more like chicory coffee with a small splash of pumpkin liqueur. Theres a slight chalkiness, but also a bit of cream and not unpleasant oiliness. Bitter roasted coffee finish but it doesnt linger.
The body is no more than medium, and fairly smooth though with a bit more buzz than one expects from 6.5 percent ABV. This feels more like a decent porter than a stout.
Elysian is the home of pumpkin beers, but this is one that is around the mark without being a bullseye.

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a nearly pitch black color with a small brown colored head. The head fades relatively quickly leaving just some light foam on the surface of the beer and almost no lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is a wonderful blend of milk chocolate aromas mixed with a nice pumpkin pie. The pumpkin pie consists of a brown sugar sweetened, roasted pumpkin smell mixed with a nice showing of cinnamon along with some nutmeg and allspice. Some lighter aromas of a vanilla and a light biscuit nature combined with the chocolate and pumpkin pie, acting as a melding and bridging set of aromas; overall the smell is quite fantastic.

 Taste  The taste begins with a darker chocolate flavor mixed with some bready and roasted malt flavors. The pumpkin flavor upfront is rather light, but grows more intense as the flavor advances. The vanilla is strongest upfront with the chocolate with both losing some potency as the taste moves on. While the chocolate and vanilla fade a tad, the pumpkin kicks it up with a more flavors of brown sugar and spices of tons of cinnamon as well as some nutmeg and allspice getting more potent as well. In the end with the increase in the pumpkin pie flavors and a still rather strong presence of the chocolate (even though slightly lightened from the beginning)and roasted flavors a rather nice chocolate and roasted pumpkin pie flavor is left to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average to slightly thinner side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. The lower carbonation is perfect for the mix of pumpkin pie and roasted and chocolate flavors. A little thicker of a body may have helped these flavors along further, but even with that said, the feel was rather nice overall.

 Overall  A rather tasty dark pumpkin ale with a great blend of roasted, chocolate, cinnamony, and pumpkin beer flavors. Very tasty.","","Darkmagus82"

83,"2014-07-02",3.8,"October 5th, 2012 - Elysians Pumpkin Ale has become just as much of a Halloween tradition for me as have the harvest themed decorations and the other adult obligation of a candy bowl by the door. Elysian itself never left an especially profound mark on me in spite of two years living in Seattle and sipping their communion, but the Pumpkin Ale is more than a couple standard deviations of their mean in terms of quality and impact. Thats why when one of their pumpkin ale permutations made an appearance at my local liquor store, I drove there aggressively and without mercy. Dark O The Moon In Hand, I greedily poured my glass, ready to salute the increasing chill of the Fall season with a proper brew. The smell is smooth and creamy, with any presumptions of pumpkin sweetness replaced with scents of full on pumpkin scones - the very same found at Starbucks as a popular seasonal offering. The fore sip presents lots of dark malts, the heavy smokiness of charcoal briquettes, and a moderate alcohol burn to wash away any residual candy or pumpkin pie. The middle presents more of a vegetal core, with burnt pumpkin seeds and some pumpkin flesh countering the burnt sugars found at the beginning of the sip. And finally, the aftertaste masquerades as a regular, yet rich, stout, regrettably shedding any vestiges of the pumpkin flavor and returning to a stoutish normalcy.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Thanks to a West Coast trader for generously sending this along. After a couple of samples of other Elysian seasonals on a trip I could not wait to crack it open. A fine beer that is different than your usual fall release this is one everybody should try if available.

Aroma / Appearance - The rick velvety black base is dense like coffee left too long in the pot. A thin deep ring of cocoa head circles the edges of the glass. Pumpkin seeds dipped in bakers chocolate hovers in the air. Also present are spicy coffee, nutmeg, and cinnamon.

Flavor / Palate - The mouth full of chocolately pumpkin seeds clings to the corners of the mouth after a few sips. A soft transition to velvety truffles carries into a bittersweet finish. Like a glass of hot chocolate made from scratch it is filling and full of flavor. I would not turn down a pint or bottle of this in the future.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
83,"2012-11-24",4.7,"Bomber bottle from my neighbor Bob - thanks!  None of the normal nastiness youd associate with pumpkin brewing is found here.  Somehow Elysian has me convinced that a good stout is possible from the vine.","Pennsylvania, USA","MarkSachon"

Aroma - Typical roasty stout notes with a touch of cinnamon 
Appearance - Pitch black with a light brown head.
Taste - Roast malt of a stout with a touch of pumpkin and the seeds with a strong cinnamon note.
Palate - Slightly less body than your average stout perhaps because the pumpkin is added in the mash.
Overall - This is the best pumpkin stout Ive had to date and perhaps the best pumpkin beer Ive had.  It is more than a novelty, but something you wouldnt mine drinking all night.","Alabama, USA","CV8Mate"

Theres a nuttiness about the aroma that is hard to pinpoint.  Tastes like an American Stout except with more character and a smokey slightly dark side to it.  Could use a little more dark-caramel malt sweetness to really give complexity.  Feels velvety and smooth, like there might just be something hiding around the corner.

Mostly like their Night Owl Ale but burned to a cinder and caramelized. To me it?s a big improvement. Medium body. Very dry finish.

Aromas start out with a malty base of dark chocolate and caramel sweetness, hinting at nougat, with a nice amount of countering coffee roast and a bit of earthen hoppiness.  Pumpkin comes across quite subtly, though it is distinct, and it is more of the fleshy variety than the drier, more vegetal profile present in most pumpkin beers.  Flavors are again very well balanced, showing just a bit of fresh pumpkin sweetness to go along with the dark chocolate and caramel-coffee roast.

83,"2009-10-28",3.7,"Bomber from Malt and Vine. Pours quite black with a very dark tan head. Aroma is strongly chocolate over very toasted malt. It smells smooth. Medium body with frothy carbonation. Flavor is chocolate, smooth burnt malt. It finishes quite bitter. Wonderful stuff. Perhaps the pumpkin accounts for the smoothness.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
83,"2009-10-28",3.8,"Draft at Iron Hill West Chester. Poured Black with a small tan head that lingered for a while. Aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, cream.  Mouthfeel was full bodied and creamy but finished dry.  Tastes of roasted malts, chocolate, very light pumpkin, nutmeg, and cinnamon.  Pumpkin  flavors pretty well overpowered by the roastiness of this, but not bad.","Silver Spring, Pennsylvania, USA","Miver"
83,"2009-10-27",3.3,"Draft. Iron Hill WC. No pumpkin flavor at all but a decent stout otherwise. Hints of hops and roasted chocolate malts, well balanced and smooth, but was let down as I did not taste any pumpkin","Lancaster, Pennsylvania, USA","KornDogg"
83,"2009-10-26",3.9,"Nearly opaque blackish brown color with a small, tan head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of chocolate malts, roast, some smoke, cinnamon, and pumpkin meat.  Taste of roast, chocolate, spices, pumpkin, and toast, with a dry finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
83,"2009-10-18",3.6,"Deep brown pour with tan/reddish head. Very viscous mouthfeel; flavor and aroma are pumpkin, nutmeg, chocolate. A bit sweet.","Seattle, Washington, USA","acblue"
83,"2009-10-17",4.0,"Pours like Halloween--deep deep brown with an almost orange head.  Aromas of chocolate, coffee, cinnamon and toasted pumpkin seeds.  Creamy palate.  Tastes chocolatey, faint pumpkin, toasted seeds, and cinnamon.  Think the pumpkin adds to the palate more than anything, making it creamier.  Very much enjoy.","Portland, Oregon, USA","gracefullypunk"
83,"2009-10-15",3.7,"Tap @ Blind Tiger.  Pours a deep ruby-brown (almost black) with a tan head.  Aroma of coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, and other spice, though I couldnt detect cinnamon.  Flavor is chocolate and roasted malt up front, with coffee and cinnamon on the finish.  Pretty strong and far from watery.....It was very solid.","North Bellmore, New York, USA","thenick"
83,"2009-10-13",3.9,"Nose of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, and warm spices.  Pour is deep and dark with a mocha colored head ... quite nice to look at.  Flavor is a nice balance between the nose and a subtle hint of pumpkin and cinnamon.  The pumpkin and spice aspect is not overpowering by any means, but show up nicely in the finish.  The body could be a little bit heavier to go along with the awesomely wicked theme, but that is just being picky, and the brew is more than viscous enough for a standard stout.  Love the seasonal bottle artwork!  Im glad to have tried this festive treat, and would gladly pick one up again each year.","Wilderness, WA, USA, ","brewolf"
83,"2009-10-10",4.0,"Finally, a pumpkin brew I can get on board with! Pours black, with a burnt mocha head - beautiful. The pumpkin is understated here (probably why I like it), and most of the notes are dark chocolate and coffee. Nice thick mouthfeel, and a very dry finish. Wish Elysian made a normal impy stout - this is really tasty. Cant wait for the pumpkin to be tapped at the brewery. Really good stuff!","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"
83,"2009-10-10",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2009 Black with a tan head. Aroma has some mild pumpkin pie spices along with dark roasted malts and semi sweet chocolate.  Medium - full bodied with a rich, smooth mouthfeel. Nice flavors of nutty dark roasted and lightly bitter burnt malts with sweet n spicy pumpkin flesh, cinnamon, and chocolate to balance. A great base stout that would do well with a bit more pumpkin and spice flavors. Draft@ Bottleworks.","Same Trailer, Different Park, Louisiana, USA","AmEricanbrew"
83,"2008-12-17",3.5,"Roasted and burnt malts aroma. Spicy nose, perhaps a touch mentholy. Dark brown pour with a thin tan head. Flavors of roasted and burnt malts, light pumpkin spice in the finish.

Pumpkin, cocoa, and toasted marshmallows in the aroma; nice and chocolatey and lightly spiced.

Lengthy finish: light cocoa, chocolate, coffee and light bitterness.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
83,"2008-11-01",4.1,"Draft @ Iron Hill - I was pretty psyched to try this as the flavors of pumpkin and porter/stout seem to be nice accompaniments.  Darker brown color with a medium head.  Aroma is roasty and spicy with cinnamon, chocolate, and roasty pumpkin.  Flavor is cinnamon and pumpkin dominant with some nutmeg, chocolate, coffee, and roast.  Smooth finish - really good stuff!","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"
83,"2008-10-30",4.2,"On tap at Iron Hill North Wales as part of their 2008 Pumpkin Fest.  Pours a deep brown almost black with a creamy deep tan head that laced.  Aroma of milk chocolate, toasted coconut, cinnamon, nuts, toffee and caramel.  Aroma was great!  Flavor of the same...a nice chocolatey porter with cinnamon notes and this interesting touch of toasted coconuts. Not sure where the coconut was coming from but this really surprised me.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"

83,"2008-10-06",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2012 Tap at Blind Tiger. Up until this night Id thought pumpkin beers were pretty much all crap. But first I had the Allagash Pumpkin, and loved it... then I had this, and it was unquestionably just as delicious, so I had to stick it right up there with the Allagash, and later the Elysian Pumpkin Scottish Ale. These guys dont mess around with their Pumpkin beers! 

This beer was a deep black with good head. Flavor has an awesome, clean coffee, roast with minor pumpkin pie spices. Not too complex but very delicious. Aroma is big coffee and well balanced. Really sessionable, and just perfectly made.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
83,"2008-10-04",3.9,"Tap at Blind Tiger.  Dark pour with a tan head.  More pumpkin in the flavor than the aroma.  Roasty with a tannic finish.  Meaty and full bodied.  The pumpkin is subtle but noticeable throughout.  Nice beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","nhorween"
83,"2008-10-04",3.6,"Draft at blind tiger. A very nice stout, good blend of malts & the pumpkin contribution is minimal.","New York, USA","Maverick34"
83,"2008-10-03",3.5,"On tap at Blind Tiger.  Pours black with a small ring of light tan head.  Aroma of roasted malt and smoke.  Flavor of light chalkiness, bitter chocolate, and sweet roasted malt.  Light bodied.  Similar to Fisherman’s Pumpkin Stout--just sort of an average stout--except that there was really no pumpkin presence.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LilBeerDoctor"
83,"2008-10-02",3.5,"Tap at Blind Tiger. Aroma roasty and smoky. Flavor of a roasty, dry stout with some earthiness. Really didn’t get any pumpkin. Still a decent beer.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
83,"2008-10-01",4.0,"Tap at Blind Tiger.  Very, very dark black beer with a light tan head.  Aroma is very toasty and chocolatey.  Dark bittersweet chocolate over a rich caramelly maltiness.  Lots of cocoa and a bit of licorice as well.  Flavour has a touch of pumpkiny sweetness but it is quite subtle in the rich chocolate, plum, and cocoa.  I was expecting something like Cape Anne, but this isn’t that at all.  Like the pils, the pumpkin contribution is subtle, but it’s definitely there.  Sticky toasty/roasty flavour with a kiss of oakty stickiness.  Quite a delicious stout.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
83,"2008-08-25",4.0,"Tap at the past two Elysian Pumpkin Fests.  Pours dark black with somewhat of an orangish tanned thick head.  Huge aroma thick with coffee, dark dark chocolate, and roasty malts.  Somewhere in the background a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg are floating around.  The flavor is a lot of the same notes...thick roasted malt backed by a sweet and dark chocolate body, pulpy with pumpkin at points.  The finish is lovely!  Hints of bitter chocolate and hops, but lots of pie spice!  Damn this is good shit!","Earth, Washington, USA","skoisirius"
83,"2008-02-14",3.9,"Draft at the Pike Street brewhouse. Pours grainy ebony, nearly black, but not quite. Densely moussy (but shallow) tan head. Mild nose of roast, cocoa, and just the faintest whisper of pie spice. Delectable, creamy medium body with firm carb. Big roasty chocolatey mid-palate with plenty of pie spice. Minimal hop. Long spicy finish.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
83,"2007-11-11",3.5,"(Draught) Sampled at Elysian Pumpkin Beer Festival on October 20, 2007. More cinnamon in the nose interlaced with a mint cream. Very cinnamon flavour, playing card gum and minor licorice. Very good.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
83,"2007-11-05",4.0,"Tap.  Black with medium brown head with a dark roasted malt flavor.  I was surprised how subtle the pumpkin flavor is.  As a normal stout it is really great even without the pumpkin.  Interesting even if it not so pumpkin-like.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Feinschmecker"
83,"2007-11-03",3.6,"10/20 On draught at the Capitol Hill brewery.  Aroma ia s great chocolate note forward, followed by low roast malt.  Appearance is dark brown/black with a medium tan head.  Flavor is strong roast malt forward with a very low pumpkin character.  The notes said it had seeds only, but the ratebeer description says meat as well.  Full bodied, all other textures are quite low. Overall, I wouldnt even have figured out this was a pumpkin beer had I not known ahead of time.","Renton, Washington, USA","Bradrcr"
83,"2007-10-27",3.4,"Dark brown colour.  Coffee roast nose with light chocolate notes.  Milk chocolate character with late roast and a hint of cinnamon, just like Mexican chocolate.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
83,"2006-11-19",3.4,"UPDATED: OCT 21, 2007 11-19-06Dark porter/stout appearance w. an easy cream head. Mild, nearly indiscernable sweetish hop/malt mix w. a light roastiness. Not much, if anything, in the way of pumpkin.  Mildly roasted taste, a medium-bodied stout.
10-21-07 - Deep chocolate note. Nice roast barley and chocolate malt emphasis. A fine stout, albeit pumpkin is undetectable.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
83,"2006-10-22",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 21, 2007 2007 Update: Chocolate/cinnamon goodness; I just love this beer. Bitter finish. I wish they had this all the time.

2006:
Chocolate and spice aroma is perfect for a pumpkin beer. Just enough, not overwhelming spice. Dark black with nice head. Chocolate, coffee, tobacco taste with a nice slightly hoppy finish. Very nice roastiness to it that is quite unique....guessing its from the roasted pumpkin seeds. I wanted to steal a keg of this. Awesome.","Seattle, Washington, USA","glkaiser"
