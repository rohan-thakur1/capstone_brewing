2233,"2016-02-22",3.4,"Draft - Loght grains and a touch of sweetness. Clear pale gold with a decent white head. Sweet, light bitterness and a grainy finish. Nice.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2233,"2016-01-27",3.3,"Tap into a shaker showing well filtered golden yellow with a finger of clean white foam. 

The nose shows extremely subtle and barely perceivable light bready malt. 

The palate is well carbonated, moderately sweet with light sweet malts on the first impression that evolve into bready grain round malts on the palate and the same on the finish.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"
2233,"2016-01-26",3.3,"Golden clear color. Frothy white head. Nice bready malt, slightly sweet nose. Very clean, sweetish mouth with good cereal notes. Slightly tart sharp finish. Not bad but not great","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
2233,"2016-01-17",3.2,"Tap, Fremont Brewing, Sept 13. Pours a clear dark gold-orange body with a small foamy tight bubbled white head, nice lacing. The nose is nice light vienna malt with some slightly grainy notes and a light hoppiness. The flavor is a bit thin with weak vienna and caramel malt, just a bit of bitterness on the finish. Light bodied, fizzy, short finish. Meh, pretty plain overall, a little too sweet and thin for my tastes.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
2233,"2014-10-18",2.6,"On tap at Chuckanut, pours a crystal clear pale yellow with a small white head. Aroma is very restrained, with very feint German lager yeast notes - not getting much here. Flavour is along the same lines - very dry, rather boring, but very German tasting. Competent and easy drinking, but not overly enjoyable. Lacking character.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2233,"2014-10-18",3.3,"Draft at the 192 lake trail. Pours surprisingly light and clear for the style. Almost a cider like pour. Faint malts on the aroma. Thin grassy flavor with some nutty malt finish. Not a bad beer here, very unique for an Oktoberfest. Enjoyable.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
2233,"2014-09-22",3.5,"Draught at the brewpub, as Festbier 2014, 5.8% ABV, 22 IBUHazy blond color. It has a delicate nice aroma of cereals. Smooth mouthfeel, soft, with some cereals flavor, bready, wheaty, and low bitterness, maybe traces of grassy hops.Like an unhopped Helles more than a Festbier. Pleasant.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
2233,"2013-10-11",3.6,"Pours blond, finger white head.

Smell grainy lager, bit of minerals.

Good.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Smurf2055"
2233,"2013-10-09",3.8,"On tap @ Von Trapps. Pours golden yellow with thick fluffy white head that retains impressively. Aroma is thin, faintly sweet malt. Taste is rich lightly toasted malt with thin grassy surprisingly assertive hops on the finish. This style of beer is right in Chuckanuts wheelhouse, and the hop balance gives a nice NW touch to this classic style.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"
2233,"2013-09-15",3.6,"Got this at the Lower Tavern in Eastsound, Orcas Island, WA. Came in the pint glass a hazy bright yellow. Small white head and light lacing. The nose is floral hops and caramel malts. Light to medium body and a clean smooth lager mouthfeel. Flavor is caramel malts and hops, with some bitterness. the finish is crisp and the bitterness lingers.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
2233,"2013-09-11",3.6,"Guest draft at fremont. Listed as ""fest 2013,"" so I assume this is it. Aroma: lager, toast, sweet, lightly spiced, festive, sulfur. Clear amber, white head, irregular lacing. Reasonably sweet taste, short crisp finish. Light-medium body. Overall: as expected, a well-crafted lager from chuckanut.
