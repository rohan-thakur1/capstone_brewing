1931,"2015-11-14",3.2,"Not bad. Very hoppy. Thats pretty much it. Heavy hops that leave a residual stick to your mouth. Aroma is average for a beer of this hop level. Bitter and some cardboard. Tap","norristown, Pennsylvania, USA","katrinaez"

Aroma: The aroma is fairly weak with notes of pale malt and dough, and maybe some subtle fruit

Appearance: Pours a mostly clear orange color with a thin beige head and light, drippy lace

Flavor: The taste is light sweet, doughy and malty, with lightly bitter herbal and spice notes

Palate: Light-medium bodied, with a slightly tingle on the tongue, and a light dry close

Overall Impression: 
Not a bad beer, but, honestly, Id probably try the crab cake cheesesteak over drinking this one again. Thats sounds just crazy enough that it could be tasty - or awful, probably awful. Not a lot more to say about the beer, but Ive now successfully made myself hungry.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
