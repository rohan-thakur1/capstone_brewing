22,"2008-06-17",3.1,"On tap in Germany.  Decent dunkle weiss beer with a thick, creamy head.  A bit heavy with a slight bite to it.  Still, I do buy it occasionally at BevMo.","VACAVILLE, California, USA","Guinnessman"

Starting with a strong medium body that goes down with a creamy feel.  Finish is a rich sweet flavor back by a mild bitterness.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","RSRIZZO"

Big banana, apple, malt, and dried fruit in the nose. There are flavors of caramel and banana with hints of clove and raisins. Tasty and drinkable. Well made beer.","Portland, Oregon, USA","HumuloneRed"

22,"2004-12-11",3.5,"2003 bottle @ Sunset Grille.  Pours a medium brown with yellow tinges and some darker, murky, reddish-coppers.  Good yellow head perched on top.  Aroma of sweet caramel, light yeast and a dry, earthy root-like note, with some dry cocoa and some very smooth plum-like characteristics.  Flavor is not vinous or even bocky and oily.  Just a good, even caramel malt, with some raisins, smooth wheat notes, hints of alcohol, yeast and sugar.  Gets very light as it progresses through the body; this is no Aventinus.  good, but too subdued and never really regains ground on the finish.  Even and well-balanced but a bit lacking in the flavor/complexity aspect.  Havent seen this one ever since trying it one night at Sunset.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
22,"2004-10-01",3.9,"Pours turbid copper with aroma of malt, yeast, citrus, slight banana, and slight cognac.  Tastes malty, with a cognacy, fruity, weissy finish.  I found this one to be delectable, and i will buy it again.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
22,"2004-02-07",3.4,"Hazy deep copper in color with a small white head.Banana/bubblegum,malty,yeasty and fruity.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","dirtymike"
22,"2004-01-12",4.1,"Cloudy, golden-maze color with thick, white, brainy head that lasts.  Sweet hoppiness and fruits like banana, apple, mild orange and spice (like ham?) in the aroma and carrying to the taste.  Only lightly sweet and acidic with little bitterness on the smooth, creamy palate.  A nice beer and readily available.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
22,"2004-01-05",3.8,"Bottle.  Light brown with a nice head. Aroma was very yeasty with some malt and a bit of fruitiness.  Nice smooth palate with a nice mix of hop, malt and spice. I would like to try this one again.","Amherst, Massachusetts, USA","ukoolaid"
22,"2003-06-20",4.7,"Overall my favoritest beer in the world.  This is about the highest rating you will see from me.","USA","adambomb"
22,"2003-06-09",3.5,"Hazy copper color, good head but died quickly, very little lacing, thin to medium-bodied. Sweet aroma of malt and yeast, some spicy and fruity characteristics noted. More fruity and hoppy on the palate than a bock but tame compared to the hefeweizen, good balance, complex enough to get your attention. Recommended for your getting bored with the standard weizen.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
22,"2003-02-14",4.1,"Pours a cloudy light brown with little head.  Sweet wheaty yeast aroma.  Full bodied and incredibly smooth.  Caramel malty flavor with good balance and enough of a Hallertauer hop finish to cover any trace of alcohol.  Just a small step behind Aventinus.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
22,"2003-01-31",3.8,"This is very good.  I enjoy it more on draft.  It has a pleasing malt character and and nice wheat nuance.  Buttery at times but usually a fine brew.","Croydon, Pennsylvania, USA","fuchebu"

22,"2003-01-18",4.0,"Pours a murky light brown with thin tan head.Aroma reminds of an apple spice muffin. First sip features tart spicy fruit. Hints of banana,clove,cinnamon,nutmeg,apple some plum but only faintly in the background. This is a very good brew,if only it was easier to get...","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"
22,"2003-01-16",4.2,"Pours a cloudy light amber color, huge frothy off white head that lasts, fruity spicy aromas of apple, butter and bananas. Sweet fruity wheat and apple flavors, very spicy and yeasty. Medium body and has a soft and creamy mouthfeel, alcohol very well hidden, I will have to get another bottle of this one.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MaxPower"

22,"2002-12-02",4.2,"Dated 9/02.  Cloudy amber color with a frothy heavy cream colored head.  Amomas of light bananas, pears, cloves and mace.  Sweet malt flavors with only a touch of phenols.  Smooth and silky feel.  Finishes with a rich malt and mild fruitiness.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
22,"2002-09-24",4.3,"Great, sweet beer. Almost fruity but not quite.  Not the best weizen bock ever, but somewhere up there.","houston, Texas, USA","uhorpheus"
22,"2002-09-04",3.8,"Cloudy, gooey honey appearance, with typical weisse froth.  Super-sweet aroma, floral (honey suckle and roses), sweet cream, light spice.  Yum.  Doesnt quite live up to the olfactory experience, but still quite good.  A bit more hop presence here than Im used to, and theres a light alcoholic tinge.  Appropriate balance between wheat and bock characteristics.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
22,"2002-07-22",4.0,"An interesting variation of the typical wheat.  I liked the darker color and enjoyed the fruity undertones.","Michigan, USA","Aggie80"
22,"2002-04-24",2.9,"The bock is more often than not a favorite of mine, but this one just didnt appeal to me. I was alreday a few pints into the night, so it went down easily, but it was obvious that I just did not enjoy the taste of this one as much as others I have had. Seemed somewhat salty to me. But despite that, very original.","College Station, Texas, USA","vacek"
22,"2002-03-29",4.4,"This is a 7% alcohol by volume wheat beer brewed in bottled in München, Germany. Pours with a cloudy orange/caramel color with a thick, beige colored head. Malty aroma with yeasty, citrusy, banana-like, clove, nutmeg, and dark rye bread flavors. A great beer that is actually pretty refreshing even though it is high in alcohol.","Pico Rivera, California, USA","maxhits"
22,"2002-03-22",3.7,"Very refreshing.  It looked very pretty....the aroma reminded me of a golden belgian.  It had sweet hoppy flavor as it went down and rounded out smoothly.  Not bad at all.","Katy, Texas, USA","Andrew196"
22,"2002-03-22",3.9,"An excellent bock.  The wheat flavor comes out toward the finish perfectly!  Fruity beginning, quite sweet.  Very complex, very enjoyable.","Mountain View, California, USA","AceOfHearts"
22,"2002-03-16",3.7,"Head is initially large, frothy, off-white, fully lasting. Body is hazy light amber, bottle conditioned. Aroma is moderately malty (light bread), moderately yeasty (dough), with notes of banana, clove, and honey. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately acidic, lightly sweet, lightly bitter. Medium to full body, creamy texture, lively carbonation. In all honesty, having just sampled H-Ps regular Weisse minutes ago, this is just a sweeter/thicker version of that...the aroma is extremely similar, and the color is only marginally darker (the picture here is misleading, as its really light/medium amber). Pleasant though.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
22,"2002-03-07",4.6,"Excellent spicy and fruity beer. Hackers regular dark wheat was a little bit disappointing to me, but this wonderful wheat bock made up for it.","Buffalo, New York, USA","estoppel"
22,"2002-02-11",4.4,"Very nice and definitely recommended.  Dark weiss beers are fast becoming one of my favorite styles.  The darkness does not overshadow the wheat as you may expect, rather it adds a new dimension to it.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
22,"2001-11-30",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 21, 2014 What a fine product.  Dessert apples and delicate floral hops.  Some chocolate and beautiful deep orange with some spices and slippery wheat in there.  A pretty solid weizenbock!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
22,"2001-11-30",4.6,"Aromatic nose steeped in a roasty apple malt along with some spice and orange rind.  Cloudy, dark brown with little head, this begins sharply, but slowly mellows to reveal a balanced, if not slightly hyper-malted, lightly sweet chocolate and apple flavor.  Despite the over-carbonation, this brew is excellent, deliciously merging and exuding spicy sweetness with malt and the luscious, mellowed natural-sugariness and heartiness of dark fruit.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
22,"2001-11-29",4.1,"Light coppery color with lacing white head. Very earthy aroma, with yeast pervading. Light yeasty taste with lemon and other pleasant citrus pungency to it. Somewhat flowery, overall very tasty, worth a try.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"

22,"2001-09-26",4.1,"Unbelievable complexity. Try a few, you wont be disappointed, especially if you enjoy the weiss or doppel varities.","USA","Kodos"
22,"2000-10-27",4.0,"All the malt richnesss and bready flavor of a German Dopplebock combined with the yeasty spiciness, clove and banana of a Dunkle Weisse. This is truly a fantastic German beer! Phenomenal complexity and intensity.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"
