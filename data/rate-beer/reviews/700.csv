Température de début 9 à 10°.
Belle robe brun sombre à reflets roux presque opaque.
Mousse ivoire assez persistante; carbonatation moyenne.
Nez très subtil fruité et chocolaté avec de discrets arômes de houblon.
Le goût est tout aussi agréable avec douceur et amertume qui se bousculent en un bouquet de saveurs riches et complexes: notes florales et de café avec des touches boisées et de malts de whisky.

700,"2017-04-26",4.3,"Très belle bière ambrée sombre avec de beaux reflets pourpres et une très fine mousse ivoire... Nez sur le caramel et le malt à Whisky avec un alcool qui me semble plutôt relevé malgré ce ""petit"" 7.2% abv. Un très joli côté vin cuit avec des effluves puissants de Porto, de Pineau des Charentes ou de Muscat de Rivesaltes. Du fruit donc, avec ce raisin fermenté, des notes de pruneau, de prune et de mirabelle. En bouche, texture souple, soyeuse, presque huileuse. Alcool efficient, amertume légère mais astringence tannique plutôt élevée avec une belle sécheresse au palet qui contrecarre le côté soyeux sur la langue, levures en arrière-bouche, terreuses et boisées. Les sucres sont assez légers tandis que ce sont les esters qui donnent cette puissance à lalcool. Les notes boisées, terreuses, tourbées combinées aux malts et à de bonnes saveurs de noix font de ce breuvage totalement dans lesprit dune Scotch Ale. On décèle aussi en rétro-olfaction de grosses notes de tabac et de fumée que je retrouve en particulier dans la Tequila et surtout le Mescal. Je ne mattendais pas un jour à retrouver des notes de Mescal dans une bière ! Mais bon, elles sont bien là pour mon plus grand plaisir. La longueur est moyenne, le final est justement sur ces notes de bois fumés et de tourbe. Pas dune grande complexité, pas des plus gourmandes, mais cette bière propose de très belles flaveurs quon ne rencontre pas dans toutes les bières à commencer par les Scotch Ale dont elle se réclame (à juste titre).

700,"2016-05-23",4.2,"2012 vintage.Visited Traquair house on my stay in Peebles just down the way back in 2006. The only beers of a long trip I never noted down. Good to have a few bottles ageing away now so into a chalice this one goes. At cellar temperature it settles out quickly with little head bar a film of tannish bubbles. The body a deep, russet brown and slightly hazy - unexpected for its well-kept age. Nose is musty and dominated by meaty umami and caramelised fruit mince, hints of date, spruce, damp wood, sherry, leather and sodden earth. On the palate it is vinous, rather tart and fruity whilst still thrusting forward a very earthy and complex malt profile. Light hint of roasted carob, tea leaves, musty oak barrels, grilled beef, leather and cocoa powder heightens its lack of sprightly carbonation. The body medium with the light berry-like acidity of the swallow matched by meaty malts give off a full finish and lasting presence in the olfactories. It is warming but this marries in well. A touch of smoke and charred berries builds giving it a gentle bitterness. A very well balanced, complex and yet restrained, and contemplative brew. A tribute to the house of Traquair.

3.25 A: Dark amber brown that is constantly changing color based on the amount and angles of light. One and a half fingers of frothy beige head. Retention is a bit below average and not much lacing is left.

4.75 S: The nose on this is incredible. I just had the Jacobite Ale not long ago and I can now smell what was under all that coriander. Powerful, yet supple peat and mineral. Molasses, caramel, and brown sugar. Oaken woodiness. Earthy and outdoorsy. Doesnt have the big, bold aromas of a lot of American brews, but it has the sophistication and integration of the Trappist brews. Really well done.

3.75 T: The taste is very good, but its only a tenth of pleasurable as the smell. Still, its a tasty brew. Peat and mineral. Oak and earthiness. Caramel, molasses, and brown sugar. It comes together well, but just not as well as the nose. Im picking up a big more tannic astringency than Id like as well.

3.5 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. A bit of tannic astringency on finish. This could benefit from some more creaminess.

Pours an opaque very dark brown, nearly pitch black, with a one finger medium tan head. Pretty good head retention but the lacing is lacking.

Aroma is full of toffee and caramel with some hints of sherry. Touches of oak along with dark fruits and some smoke poking through.

The flavor is very heavy on the figs and plums with more of the sherries note present in the aroma. Some burnt toffee and smokey notes in the background but the flavor is overwhelmingly fruity. It works in this case, though. Some woody notes in the background but they are very restrained. Subtle sweet mouthfeel with a bit of lingering stickiness.

Overall, a very good scotch ale and more fruity than many of the other ones I have had. Great interplay between the wood, smoke, and fruit and well balanced. A great beer.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

700,"2014-07-18",4.0,"This was poured into a thistle glass. The side of the bottle says ""best before June 2018.""
The appearance was a really dark red close to a hazed over dark brown of sorts kind of color. The head was about one fingers worth of white foaminess that must have maintained itself for at least a good three minutes before it gently concaved into the body. The lacing was semi-thick and broadened itself all around the glass.
The smell had a strong sweet peatiness overpowering some light roasted caramel notes with a sweet nuttiness underneath. Also, theres a nice light vanilla and dark fruits really underneath.
The taste was mainly the sweet caramel notes and a touch of the nuts come back through some woody notes (assuming the oak barrels it was aged in). The aftertaste and finish are dry and sweet leading with the caramel notes.
On the palate, this one sat right at a medium on the body with a slight sessionability to it. The carbonation was extremely subdued but thats okay as the peat helps to maintain the stability of this beer.
Overall, this was a wonderful offering by Traquair for the style and for me.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

700,"2014-06-16",3.7,"Mainly available filtered in bottles, though part of the production goes unfiltered into cask. The traditional brewing process used in the production of Traquair House Ale consists of the following; 1. Traditional infusion mashing process. The wort is then drawn off and boiled during which process the hops are added. 2. The wort is now cooled and pitched with top fermenting yeast under controlled temperature. It is then fermented in oak over a period of seven days. The beer is then transferred into cold storage tanks or barrels and matured over a period of weeks. After maturation the beer is filtered prior to packing.

700,"2013-12-08",4.0,"Rating from 2008: Die Flasche sieht sehr edel aus; gefunden hab ich es bei Maruhn in Darmstadt. Haltbar bis 2016! Das Bier im Glas ist schön dunkelbraun mit rötlichem Ton. Der Geruch ist vollmundig-süß, malzig und geht schon in Richtung Rotwein. Der Antrunk ist im ersten Moment neutral, aber schon nach nicht ganz einer Sekunde wird ein fruchtig-vollmundiges Aroma freigesetzt. Trotz den 7,2% ist das Bier äußerst süffig, im Hauptteil stehen fruchtig-schokoladige Aromen im Vordergrund. Ich schmecke Trockenpflaume, dunkle Kirsche, Rosinen. Dazu ein schönes Espresso-Schokoladenaroma. Der Nachgeschmack ist mittellang, angenehm röstmalzig-dezent süß und gar nicht herb. Auf der Zunge verbleibt eine trocken-leicht süße Röstmalznote!

700,"2013-10-30",4.6,"FROM NOTES: July 1, 12
330ml bottle poured into a tulip with my buddy in Napa, CA. 

A: Caramel malts strong on the nose, with molasses notes, and maybe some figs and/or dates. I can taste the alcohol, but it doesnt feel out of place, and sort of compliments the dark malty profile. An inviting aroma that fits the style well, it warms to reveal some nutty tones, along with toffee and subtle woodsy notes. 
A: Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights and a small head that dissipates fairly quickly. Not a ton of lacing, but it does gives some nice legs with each sip, coating the glass in suds. 
T: This is a very robust malty flavored beer. A dark caramel malt base is the backbone for a variety of flavorful notes to come through. Dark fruits, (figs and/or dates) and just a touch of black cherries can be identified. Alcohol warmth and a molasses taste give it some hearty weight. Hazelnut and hints of toffee and maple add to the sweeter side, and oak and peat provide some delicious earthy tones. Finishes with just the right amount of alcohol heat, along mild bitterness and cocoa. Truly a well crafted flavor profile, and a damn drinkable beer. 
P: Smooth and creamy. Low carbonation, with a medium-to-heavy weight to the body. Slight warmth in the finish with mild lingering bitterness. 
O: A dark, complex, and flavorful beer. As a major fan of the style, I consider this the standard by which all others are measured. DELICIOUS!!!","New Jersey, USA","ClassyBeagle"

700,"2013-08-08",3.1,"Ive had another Traquair beer a few years ago. That one was decent enough for me to try another that was offered me from the source - Scotland. That said it is pretty tame. If I saw it on the shelf at the local store I would probably skip rest past.

Aroma / Appearance - The caramel colored base is ringed with a dask of eggshell hued head. The pair looks nice in the glass as it releases waves of rich chocolate, caramel, and dense heady malts. Black cherries and a hint of vanilla add to the texture of a heavy red wine.

Flavor / Palate - Malt vinegar, bakers chocolate, and fresh tea ruin what could have been a great experience with tastes all over the map. The funky aspects take a promising scotch ale and send it to the land of ""never again."" You should too.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Taste is rather sweet, with a moderate bitterness as well. Mouthfeel is less sticky than expected, medium to full body,  soft carbonation.  Might improve with keeping.

700,"2013-03-13",3.7,"Reviewed 2/9/13.16.9 oz bottle into a nonic pint glass.

A: Pours a deep cola brown color. The head is a one finger white shade which quickly descends into a thin film. Lacing is okay.

S: This is quite caramel-forward in its malt profile, and also some biscuity malt/yeast interplay as well. Theres an element of dry chocolate here, alongside some brown sugar, molasses I have some trouble detecting the oak barrel here, but its not a negligible presence. Quite pleasant.

T: At first, I notice some vaguely smoky caramel malts, before giving way to some brown sugar and molasses. The exhales present a lot of smoky chocolate on the palate - and is probably my least favorite aspect of this, due to how dangerously close they come to tasting like flatulence. Unlike Jacobite, theres a faint presence of leafy, herbal finishing hops which helps balance the sweet maltiness in conjunction with the barrel tannins. Not particularly complex, but it goes down with superb ease.

M: Extremely clean and dry finishing. A slight amount of alcohol-concealing residual sugar lingers past the initial tannin presence - however after a while the tannic quality accumulates, which goes even further toward drying the palate out. I might even surmise that the heavy (but not harsh) dryness kills its potential complexity. Firm yet gentle carbonation helps ease this one down superbly.

O: Personally, Im more inclined to prefer a less bone-dry Scotch ale (like Old Chub). Im also a bit let down in its lack of depth; but on the flipside, the drinkability this presents is impressive. All things considered, a bit too expensive ($8/16.9 oz) given that it seemingly focuses on drinkability over complexity. That doesnt mean it isnt very good, however.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

330ml bottle poured into a Hoegaarden Grand Cru stemmed tulip.

Lovely dark brown/reddy colour, tan coloured tightly knitted foamy head. The head left some good lacing on the glass, so condition of the beer was good.

Dark chocolate smells come from the beer, coffee esters also in the mix for my nose.

The flavours followed the smells, chocolate and coffee, with the coffee being the dominant one this time. The alcohol content is just below the surface, but can just about he found as the mouth dries after each sip. Not as sweet as I thought it might be, or expected after the first sniff.

700,"2012-03-11",4.3,"First introduced to this classic Scottish barley wine at the 1983 Edinburgh Beer Festival. Dispensed by gravity from a small wooden barrel, it seemed to wriggle thickly from the spout!! Black ruby in colour with a thin creamy off white head. Strong, powerful and a distinctive sherry like/christmas pudding aroma, long in intensity. Very, very thick mouthfeel, with a luxurious silky smooth single cream texture. Potent flavours vie for attention from the dark malt complexes. Moist maltloaf laced with molasses and booming syrupy dates, prunes, plums, raisins  and treacle toffee. There is a slight nod to the hops with a brief prickle in the aftertaste. Finish is pure Scottish malt and it comes in a tidal wave of oak cask sherry warmth with a hint of vanilla and dark American chocolate. This is a traditional Scottish Barley Wine and a rare bird to find in cask even up here. Highly recommended.","Saltcoats, SCOTLAND","tombyars"

As the beer warms there is another sour bread flavour which is tantalising but seems to dissipate rapidly and doesnt last long in the mouth.

Taste: Its quite watery and lacks depth. Slight cough syrup, roasted malts and a yeasty finish. 
Palate: Disjointed and boring. A little light in body for a darker beer I think and theres no carbonation. Flavours seem transparent and passive minus the funky yeast finish.

700,"2011-11-21",4.2,"330ml Bottle from Waitrose:
Dark malts hit the nose straight away and are quite rich. The malts seem to be infused with some dark fruit & caramel and I can also detect a little grain and some of the alcohol as well. There is a background sweetness coming from some vanilla and butterscotch along with a bit of spice as well.

Dark reddish brown with a large, two fingers sized off-white head that is quite foamy looking. Retention isnt too bad either with the head eventually settling to a thick looking lacing after about a minute or so.

Dark malts with some dark fruits upfront, perhaps some figs in the taste. There is some caramel and vanilla too and a sweet, warm finish and a malty aftertaste.

Medium bodied, with light carbonation and an oily texture to the drink. It leaves a lingering warmth from the alcohol as the aftertaste.

A great beer and probably the best of the style I have ever tried, it was a lot better than I had been expecting. An excellent beer to sit and sip away at and most likely one Ill pick up again.

700,"2011-01-25",3.3,"Traquair House Ale pours a dark chestnut color that is virtually impenetrable by light. The head developed one finger thick even with an extremely aggressive pour. There was minimal lacing and short retention.

My nose is picking up on a handful of similar aromas: roasted malt, toffee, caramel, and molasses. They all balance each other out quite well. 

The taste was not as loaded as the aroma. I only really notice roasted and nutty caramel and toffee. It is surely less complex then smelling the beer let on. 

The mouthfeel is quite light and carbonation is low to medium. The alcohol content of 7.2% is not any more noticeable than a beer with 5%. It goes down quite easy.

The individual aspects of this beer are less than the sum of its parts. My general overall impression of this beer is quite positive. It has very complimentary flavors, smells, and mouthfeel that combine for a very enjoyable drink.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","gramity"

S: Toffee, butterscotch, light caramel, molasses, and hints of diacetyl are what I notice immediately. Everything is well integrated, though a bit lacking in the deeper caramelized malts that I would expect from such a noted Scotch Ale producer. 

T: A bit of a letdown after the nose. Not nearly as complex, as a bit of roasted nutty caramel takes over the beer, leaving a bit of lingering bitterness. Hints of butter.

M: Quite thin, especially for the style and alcohol content. This has the mouthfeel of a light Scottish Ale rather than the big boy that its supposed to be. Fairly low carbonation. Not much of an alcohol bite at all.

D: Quite drinkable given the lack of alcohol presence in the taste, and the general smooth drinkability that comes from a thinner mouthfeel and low carbonation.

700,"2010-11-27",3.7,"Pours a ruddy brown with fine suspended particles and a creamy beige head that reduces to a thin skin at the surface. The nose is big and malty with dark (yet bright) fruit, sweet baking spices, and peat notes. Medium-bodied and slick with distinct mineral-water quality to the mouthfeel. The flavor strikes me more as a wee heavy versus the flavor profile Ive gotten from other ESAs: peaty malt, a touch of dark fruit and some spicy/peppery and ashy notes conclude with a drying moderately astringent, yet pleasant, finish. This bottle being a couple years old, I also get a touch of cardboardy oxidation, but its still a pretty solid beer.

700,"2010-04-19",4.0,"330ml bottle from IPB. Best before end of Dec 17 (2017 ??)
Appearance : Depp brown with small head short retention. No lacing.

Aroma : Some oak with sweet raisins and overripe dark fruits. Notes fo peat, smoke and overcooked caramel. A bit citrus-y (reminds me of some Innis & Gunn). Hints of liquorice.

Taste : Carbonation is really soft but it fits the style. Some liquorice, oak, smoke and peat. Finish is very sweet with a small bitterness. Citrus-y also.

Overall : Wow this is good. Quite drinkable because of that citrus-y finish. Also a nice sipper. I dont know exactly why but Im enjoying this quite a lot. This is very rich and balanced at the same time. Sweet but still a bit refreshing. Cant ask for more than that. Outstanding beer. I have another.

700,"2009-05-30",3.7,"Awsome complex aroma. Soft malts, slight nutty fruit and a definite warm port scent. Reddish brown and poured what could barely be called an off white film for a head that momentarily holds on to the edge of my glass. Small floating sediment. Beer also has a somewhat cloudiness to it. The flavour consists of a bready bitterness, soft fruit that ties into the mild port-like taste, and an undertone of bisciuts. The complexity of the taste really kicks in when it warms up. This beer wouldve been even better if not for the mouthfeel being soft and slippery.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

700,"2009-04-20",3.9,"330ml bottle. BB Dec 2017!!!
Deep, near-opaque, bronze body. Small dense collar of offwhite foam that hangs around.
Big complex earthy nose; dark chocolate and roasted malts, fair bit of smoke and wood, mollasses, rum, vinous dark and dried fruits, some hop-derived spice and citrus peel sharpness. Opens out more with warmth.
Bold mouthfeel, chewy texture, reasonably low carbonation, well balanced and clean with tremendous length.
Tantalisingly complex and delicious body of flavour. Plenty of fruit-cake-like character with brown sugar, sultana, rum, citrus peel, liquorice and biscuit malt flavours, but the more you look, the more you find, with an unmistakable woody undertone bringing forth undertones of toasted oak, peat smoke, vinous berries and sherry. Finishes moderately bitter with a lingering smokiness, somewhat enticing and an alcohol warmth that would allude most who werent looking for it.
Something about this beer that really draws me in, its delicitably unique, not to mention complex and well-made, almost like a Wee heavy just a wee bit less heavy.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

700,"2009-03-09",4.0,"As I continue my great beer journey, I find before myself another one of my early beer experiences, the Traquair House Ale. I dont remember much about when I first had it a few years ago, but I do remember that I really enjoyed it.


Her body sits royally in my glass with luxurious burnt copper and deep garnet hues topped by a delicate head. She fades lazily into scattered pockets of little to big bubbles. No discernable lace yet, but a couple tender swirls prompt an immediate lacework to adorn the sides of my glass. Intrigued, I raise her inviting depths to my nose for a kiss of bright, sweet rum notes marked by wood, apples, plums, raisins, prunes, vanilla, fig, winter spices, brown sugar and maple. Suffice to say, an amazingly rich and complex bouquet of epic proportions. Any self-control I had flies out the window. Frothy and soft with a very pleasing mouthfeel. The sweetness of her palate is subtle, making way for a perfect balance of spices, plums, prunes, and raisins while apples and lemons linger in a faintly dry finish. Brown sugars along with fresh breads such as rye and pumpernickel bring it all together. A growing warmth pervades my body with each mouth-watering quaff while a hint of bitter nuts sneak into the finish. Beautiful. I couldnt ask for anything more. Traquair House Ale is refreshing, revitalizing, rich with dark fruits and sugars, warm with pleasing alcohol notes, and everything that my heart desires.


I must say that my memory really didnt serve me best when it comes to the Traquair House Ale. It isnt as good as I remember it being, but instead far better than anything I could have ever imagined. She is quite simply one of the best Scottish ales out there with the long-standing history to prove it. Run, dont walk to your nearest liquor or beer store and discover the magic.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

It is unexpected disappointing at the first sip because I was about to encounter something more powerfull and mouthcoating, in fact it has a body lighter than what it is supposed to be.

Smell: Rich, complex maltiness smelling of chocolate, caramel, roast, and syrup-coated nuts along with a modicum of dried dark fruitiness and splash of spiced rum.

Taste: Dark maltiness tasting of burnt toast spread with dark caramel and chocolate. Raisiny, vinous fruitiness. Faint touch of alcohol. Rather subtle hop character yielding on a light spicy bitterness. Taste of rum raisin on the finish. Hints of maple syrup and bittering herbs in the aftertaste.

In the background I get hints of wood and very tame European hop bitterness. The flavor is very woody in a pleasing way. It doesnt seem like sweet Bourbon or like bitter hops, but just a pleasing, even wooden flavor. The finish brings out tame hints at strawberries and a modest bitterness. Far away vinous notes are detected. I actually liked this one quite well. I was more excited about the Jacobite, but this one is perhaps more to my liking.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

700,"2008-06-26",4.7,"Traquair House Ale is a beer of huge complexity, interesting oak characters and roasted malt flavours, subtle nuances of PX and dry oloroso sherry, caramel, winey sometimes port like levels, chocolate and coffee and good hop bitterness.  Carbonation is not too high, balance of sweetness and hops works wonderfully (some lovely caramelisation in the copper) and leads to a dry finish.  Great with cheese, after dinner and although a great sipper, the mouthfeel can lend itself to being drunk awfully quickly.  Thats (heaven forbid) not to say its easy drinking and not complex however - this is a beer of subtlety. It deserves a much higher rating in my opinion and another gem in the quest for skill and subtlety in brewing to be recognised alongside extreme, easy to pick out flavours.","Somerset, ENGLAND","Crunchie"

Mostly dark dried fruits for flavor, with the oak in the background.  The aftertaste really has the peaty flavor that some have mentioned.

700,"2007-08-26",3.7,"Clean and malty, this is a good brew.  Pours deep mahogany into the glass, with an initial froth that diminishes to a small ring, leaving tiny spot lace.  The nose is of dark breads and wooden notes.  Burnt toffee is first noted.  Sweet dark malts slide over the front of the tongue and come to fruition in the mid-palate.  Yeast accompanies the malt midstream, and closes with a dark doughy-bread finish.  (I hesitate to bring rye or pumpernickel into the equation; however, thats the gist of the direction.)  In all, the mouthfeel is light (just this side of creamy), and the body is is light (with substance... not watery or thin).  A nice sour yeast lasts in the effervescence, only enhancing the sweeter malt contingencies before it.  Nice dark tones make for a delicious brew.","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"

They show up when you slosh it around. Huge, sharp pruney and bready nose. Between the tight bubbles and the sharp nose, this one makes quite an entrance just sitting on the table. Surprisingly moderate attack, with plenty of dark fruit but nothing out of balance; there are tart notes in the mid-palate and a bit of roast. Mid-palate finished rather hollow. Biscuit and toast on the finish. This is a great little beer but for whatever reason its hard to imagine seeking it out at the preemption of another beer, even in this style.

The flavors seeped through my mouth but did not reach the back of my tongue or throat; leaving me taking bigger drinks trying to extract a fuller experience.  Overall, however, a very nice Ale.

Largely dead carbonation, not much mouthfeel.  Reminiscent of a Sammy Smith.  The flavors are a bit bigger though, again, reminding me of the Sammy Smith Imperial Stout.  Big ass prune to plum to fig to raisin.  Perceptible alcohol and diacetyl.  Just the most gentle of hops.  More butter in the finish, though balanced by that nondescript musky funk.

700,"2007-01-18",3.2,"Bottle from Systembolaget. Ive got to be honest - after the first sniff and sip of this beer I hated it. I even contemplated a drain pour, but Im glad I didnt because this beers aroma transformed remarkably so many times during the 30 minutes I sipped it.
Upon opening I was hit by bubblegum (just like the gob-stoppers I used to buy as a child) and a distinct metallic nose. The beer poured a red tea colour with fizzy sepia head that foamed and frothed itself out in under a minute. My first sip reminded me of busgrogg, a Swedish drink where you mix a cheap low strength beer with a dash of moonshine. The alcohol is very obvious, dominating the very thin palate and leaving a sensation like youve just garggled with mouthwash.
What saved this beer from certain 2-point-something was the way the aroma evolved in the glass. From bubblegum it shifted to sweet porridge and oats, then caramel and finally delicious butterscotch. Ive never experienced such a transformation before - which lifted this otherwise strange brew out from the very ordinary to the rather intriguing.","Umeå, SWEDEN","lagomswedish"
700,"2007-01-05",3.5,"well, i was going to call it burgundy until i saw the light hit the glistening, deep dar, but unhazy brown.  the pour off the 11.2oz (330ml) bottle yields a beautiful above average (1.5-2"") head that slowly erodes to reveal a quite respectable bubbly head.  luckily, this does not mask the aroma in any way.  even with a rather stuffy nose, i can still pick out the malts - quite pungent indeed.  tart fruit, citrus to be exact, maybe even close to the fruits in a monks cafe - complimented by the lemongrassy hoppiness coming across in most ipas and i2pas that i have sampled recently, leave a lsting distinct impression that this will not be a typical esa.  the tasting reveals a very well balanced ripe fruity, slighty toasted hop character as well as a chewy, peaty, and seaweed (most likely from the geographic region of brew)  malt flavor.  the finish is a bit dry, but somehow leans towards the balance i spoke of earlier.  the finish is about average.  remaining is a tart finish without being either sweet or sour, while still supporting the character of the aromas.  congrats to the brewers.  worth the price? no, but close, 2 bucks cheaper and id buy a case","Murfreesboro, Tennessee, USA","andyhite"

700,"2006-12-07",3.8,"In the 330 mL bottle marked ""L4"". pours extremely dark brown -almost black- with a velvety creamy ivory colored head. A lovely looking beer. Aroma is deeply discernable during the pour. Get your nose into the glass and you will be fulfilled with the aromas of dates and raisins and chocolate and caramel. Aroma is slightly earthy and musty as well. Fruity raisin-like flavor with a semi-sweet cocoa roastedness. Slightly thinner in body than you might expect from such a big smelling beer. This has a silky smooth palate and is far too easy to put back. The head remains a long time, but it is real odd in that the fine velvet bubbles are gone, leaving a resilient head of large open popcorn bubbles. Not much lacing lags behind.

700,"2006-05-30",4.0,"(330 ml bottle) Ive had this beer cellaring for so long, I wasnt even keeping records back then for where I bought it.  Based on that, plus the thick layer of dust, Im guessing its a few years old, at least.  Barely a hiss when opening the bottle, the beer pours a very muddy, somewhat translucent, light brown color, topped by a small, beige filmy head.  The aroma is earthy, malty and fruity, but surprisingly its also a bit alcoholic.  Lots of: earth, wood, raisins, prunes, chocolate (!), coffee, yeast, and even a bit of smoke in this beer; it actually reminds like Raisinettes (thats the box of chocolate-covered raisins you can buy at most movie theaters, right?).  Full bodied but definitely not syrupy or heavy.  Carbonation is light-to-medium.  Is this really filtered?  For a filtered beer, the beer is surprisingly cloudy and there is an awful lot of gunk lining the bottom of the bottle.  A superb beer that I think would be awesome to have a rotation scheme going where you buy a new bottle every few months until you have 10 to 12, and then drink the oldest bottle.

The taste of this beer is lightly tart up front, with a rich malt character that has notes of toasted malt, a dry biscuit-like note with lots of rich toffee on top.  The taste is quite light up front, which is what I expected.  The taste is fairly dry, which seems to accentuate the tart tamarind notes.

Flavor is of sweet crystal malt and toffee and a bit of harsh charcoalish roasted malt and some peat comes through as well.  Dried fruit definitely has a large role in the flavor of this beer: raison, fig, date and cherry.  Some peppery spiciness too. Some hop bitterness is apparent though no hop flavor.

Expectations set too high, perhaps.  But I think the current average (3.73 in April 2005) is right on target.  It poured a deep ruby with brown hues and a yellow spectrum at the edge; a moderate off-white head on my pour.  Dark fruit, caramel aroma, with some alcohol effervescene and a richly woody-cherry aroma, like a good Flemish Sour perhaps.  Big sweetness filled my mouth at first, marking this out as a beer with Scottish roots.  There was a strongly vintage quality, though this bottle isnt that old, I think.  I was pleased by the raisin, woody, fruity flavors, but struck by a metallic astringent finish that didnt please.  The palate was rich of malts and had an early frothiness but it seemed to lose life quickly and as it went limper the astringency took hold.  So, overall, there is lots to like but I think the overall effect was a bit less than desired.  Still, overall satisfying.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

The fruit of the vine is on good display in this nose, massive fruit up in here, but its a sophisticated, complex mix: dates, figs, grapes, a bit o nuts, earth, wood, and a touch of pepper here and there. 
On palate, it arrives in full promise, a fine blend of hop and malt, bitter and sweet seem to patch up any differences, make amends, and create a perfect coupling. Hops continue a pretty, spicy ride upon the tongue, all the while backed up by solid and tasty, sweet malt.

Yeah, and there were some hops too.  Aroma is nicely malty, and I'm still drawn back to my fudge ripple comparison.

Taste is super mellow of caramel, dark toffee, some dark fruit notes of plum and banana, the malts are provided all over the place, but not thick, more so of a very clean and softly calming chewyness, thinnish to the point of becoming non-existent really. Not very flavorful. Some notes of hazelnut and molasses poke through as it warms but nothing sticks out really. Kinda boring and plain. Feel is a bit thin, the front of this is like water, nothing there, but luckily it picks up some and renders some light heft over the middle and has a smooth lightly sticky, calm, malty sweet finish that doesn't last all that long.

Very nice, light fizz in the mouth and lovely smooth finish.  A little more complex finish would be nice, but it's mostly bitter and slightly glowing, with moderate length.  Nice and clean.  Hops?  Strange to find them mostly in the finish.  Others mention chocolate, and now that I think about it I guess it's there, but I sense mostly raisin and hold this up there with the Raison D'Etre.

Aroma consists of alcohol soaked raisins, almond and vanilla extract, and fruit filled roasted nuts dipped in creamy milk chocolate.  Velvety mouth-feel with great tingling carbonation.

Aroma is of sweet malt and not overly strong. Some nice alcohol notes.  Smells old and mature.
Begins very flavorful with plenty of sweet malt flavor that you would expect from a scottish ale. Nice alcohol tones with a grainy earthy texture.  Alcohol is well masked and there is a bit of a scotch malt flavor and some dark sugary fruit flavor.  Body is medium.  There is a peculiar dry salty flavor as the finish approaches.  Finish is balanced and fairly round, with no acidity and little sweetness. A pleasant lingering malt/alcohol flavor on the finish, but other than that, quite uneventful towards the end.  A good beer, to be sure, and one that I will try again.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The flavor of some sweet fruit (maybe grapes) is very apparent.  My only gripe is that it tastes very tart.

700,"2002-10-27",3.5,"UPDATED: SEP 30, 2012 
Aug, 2003 There is a lot going on in this dark ruby ale - the pale and dark malts combining with the East Kent Goldings to produce a range of flavours from which you can take your pick, but fresh anthracite coal with a splash of breast milk from an alcoholic mother mixed with coca-cola is what I found. The hops are over stewed and over used, resulting in a stodgy bitterness. That stodgy bitterness is the only moment of balance I found, blending, as it does, rather nicely with the stodgy damp wood of the malt. There are sharper features to counter the stodge, but these tend to be chocolate tinged, which doesnt really add anything of interest. Overall, a rather heavy going and awkward beer which has plenty of flavours but without control or style. The brewerys Jacobite is more controlled and delightful; indeed, something of a masterpiece. But this house ale feels crudely thrown together like a homebrew. Theres flavours here, and some will like it purely because they can taste something - but those who like their beer flavours to draw an intelligent picture rather than just be slapped on the canvas, will be disappointed.  [2.7] 
Sept, 2012 330ml brown glass bottle from Dobbies. There are flavours here for sure - treacle and spices and some alcohol warmth. The fermenting is done in wooden vats, so there should be character as well, but the filtering takes the edge off that - which is a shame. This is an OK beer, and theres much to like - though not as much as one would want to like. I am enjoying this much more than I apparently did back in 2003, but theres still a feeling that the ingredients or the brewing method is not doing as much as it could to make the most of the potential. Bottle conditioning would help, though I suspect theres something else. Fermenting temperature a little too low perhaps?  [3.5]","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

Slightly less impressive 2nd time around, but still very good.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

700,"2002-06-04",3.4,"Bought in 1985 and hidden in my cellar all those years. Alc % on the label: 6%. Overwhelming porto aroma. Carbonation has almost disappeared.

700,"2002-06-02",4.2,"Heady, indulgently fruity aroma.  About the darkest but still distinguishable red/brown color Ive seen.  Extremely fine carbonation, interesting effervescence for a beer of this style.  Served at approx. 60 F in a brandy snifter, Im convinced this is the way to go.  Slightly smoky, rich fruit flavor in the malt, and just a touch of light hops for the finish.  Overall, a bit on the sweet side, but well balanced.  Some alcohol to be noticed here, even though the % is lower than expected.  Definitely a terrific strong Scottish style ale, the most complex Ive had to date.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

Those Scots know how to put a wee bit of the Scotch whisky into their brew that truly sends a jolt into you, “Beam me up, Scotty!”  A beautiful rich, dark mahogany color, little to no head at all, and a very, very dry, mostly bitter malt taste, but it improves as it slowly unwinds to room temperature, this is almost like sipping a dry cognac, a drink for the purists, and a good winter warmer...","Evanston, Illinois, USA","cranesareflying"

700,"2002-01-28",4.5,"Very, very good stuff.  Nice and dark, extremely malty, warming, thick, and with a slight madeira quality.  About as good as an ale can get.  My only complaint is, why $5 a bottle?  Its very good, but I feel that I am being taken advantage of when I buy this stuff.  Its like I can see someone at the brewery counting his money and laughing.  MacAndrews Scotch (now Stock) Ale is just about as good, and priced more reasonably.  I dont usually complain about a beers price, and will gladly pay $5 a bottle for something different, but this beer does not have any special characteristics to justify the steep price.  Its just very good, but there are other very good beers out there.  And the bottle isnt even 12 oz!  Rating down two points for being overpriced.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"

I was amazed at the wonderful malt

SATB).  This was actually served to me at room
temp (note: *not* cellar temp, *room* temp) and
it was wonderful, with all the various flavor
notes at their best, showing off the amazing
complexity of this beer.
Updating with more specifics: Dark cloudy brown, with thick dense head.  Rich plummy aroma.  Flavor full of dark fruit, figs and plums.  Lingering warm and alcoholic finish.  Not as stunning as my previous tasting, but Ill leave the 5.0 score alone.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

Thinner bodied (compared to Triple Bock though!), very malty and sweet.  This may well be the most complex beer Ive ever tried...I cant even begin to pick out everything.  I definitely detect some vanilla in there, perhaps some maple, a hint of sherry.  Aftertaste only becomes more complex while remaining sweet, and the beer itself gets better with every sip.  Something you *must* experience - slowly - for yourself.  Personally, I enjoyed it very much.","Portland, Maine, USA","Sammys"
