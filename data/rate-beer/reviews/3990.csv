3990,"2017-06-09",4.0,"It pours out an almost pitch black body with a brownish tint and a beige frothy head. The aroma is very hoppy for a black IPA  a good amount of citrusy hops; grapefruit, orange zest and tangerine notes most notably. There is the slightest bit of a toasted note underneath the hops, but damn, this smells great! The taste is a mixture of burnt malts and citrusy hops. The flavors are layered so tight that it keeps changing between toasty and hoppy  its really interesting! Its very juicy, and theres a fair bit of pine coming through towards the end. Its always hard to judge these beers, because youd expect a big roasted and full bodied beer just by looking at the color, but when you drink it its like drinking a proper IPA. Easy going down, nice levels of carbonation, and a nice bitter finish. Bevog has really made a nice beer with this one. You really get all the good stuff from both the hops and the malts  but its still on the IPA side of things (and not a hoppy stout). This is solid!","DENMARK","MarcoBasile"

 Kolor:  Barwą przypomina nieco coca-colę. Czysty, klarowny trunek. Pod światło widać niezliczone rubinowe refleksy. 
 Piana:  Ciemnokremowa, drobnoziarnista, puszysta i obfita.
Piana wydaje się nie mieć końca.
Otacza ścianki kielicha ogromnymi łańcuszkami.
Nad piwiem wisi gruba, conajmniej 3 cm otoczka.
Rewelacja! 
 Zapach:  Simcoe Till I Die! Aromat wybitnie żywiczny, mocny zdecydowany zapach sosnowych gałązek.
Na przeciwległym biegunie nuty czekolady deserowej, odrobina cytrusów i korzennych chmieli.
Na szarym końcu leciutki przypalony karmel. 
 Smak:  W smaku przede wszystkim żywica, las, igły sosnowe i modrzewiowe.
Dalej pojedyncze cytrusy i nuty korzenne.
Sporo także ciemnych słodów i prażonego zboża, a co za tym idzie sugestie prażonego słonecznika.
Przypalony karmel obecny również w sporej ilości.
Goryczka jest masywna, trochę za długa.
Finisz długi, lekko ściągający, wybitnie żywiczny, a także palony od słodów.
Umiarkowana ciało, oleista tekstura.
Mocno nachmielone IPA, bardzo goryczkowe, tylko dla twardzieli ;) 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie do średniego. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Typ takiego hardcorowego Black IPA. Solidna dawka chmielu skutkowała powstaniem piwa bardzo goryczkowego, intensywnie żywicznego z ogromną dozą palonych słodów.
Bardzo stonowane akcenty czekolady deserowej, przypalonego karmelu, czy korzennych chmieli nie są w stanie zrównoważyć mocnego żywiczno-palonego pazura.
