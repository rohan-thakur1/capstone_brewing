3217,"2016-07-19",2.5,"HOME 19072016 (33 cl bottle, bb 02.2015): Beer has a pale ale colour, slightly cloudy (more yeast in the bottle). The head is good with an off-white colour. The smell is malty  biscuit- caramel with somewhat hop bitter. Taste is like the aroma, but we will found back a slightly fruity citrus-like also in the beer. In principle it could be a good beer, but probably most of the hops already disappears. Palate is somewhat sticky and dry bitter.","Nootdorp, NETHERLANDS","EugeneStraver"

This one was quite a refreshing beer to drink & one that came through with quite a lot of citrus but still proved easy going down without being anything special. There was some nice malts coming through & the balance seemed good although nothing seemed to grab my attention or really make me want to try the beer again; enjoyable but definitely not a classic.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

3217,"2015-02-23",3.2,"0,33 l bottle from bierpost.com, best before 28/5/2015. Poured this beer into a lager glass and the first thing that happened was that 90% of the glass were filled with foam. What happened to this bottle? It therefore took me ages to fill the glass. After the foam has collapsed rather slowly, the beer itself was clear and orangeish, golden yellow with that massive, very fine pored, foamy white head. Nice, fruity aroma of orange, grapefruit, mango and tangerine with some yeasty notes. Bitter taste of grapefruit, honey, yeast and some grass. Short, medium bitter finish. Thin to medium body, still massively foaming in my mouth, average carbonation. How to rate such a beer? The huge foam was just annoying, but it would be quite unfair to rate it based on that as none of the other ratings suggests this to be a ususal development. The taste couldnt quite live up to the aroma but was still enjoyable. Very interesting experience indeed.","Hagen / Bonn, GERMANY","Zlotta"
