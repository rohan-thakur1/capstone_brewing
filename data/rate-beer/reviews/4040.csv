4040,"2013-03-03",4.2,"On tap at the brewpub. Not surprised to see that this gets a 100% for style at the time of rating and before having looked at any Tired Hands ratings, it was easily my favorite of the seven small beers I tried. Aroma beams forth with good tropical hop resins, steady and sturdy. Flavors start with the ethereal light and fresh green hop qualities and then merge beautifully into a n almost nutty malt base. One of the more broadly complex Pale Ales IÂ’ve had in awhile and I give it a lot of credit for being balanced, hop flavor delicious, and with malt nuance. ItÂ’s hard to pull that off.
