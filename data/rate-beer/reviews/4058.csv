4058,"2016-12-08",3.7,"16 oz. can. Hazy orange body with an ample white head. Smells of orange, lime, graham cracker, and a touch of vanilla. Took some warming for me to get all the adjuncts in the nose. Tastes much more strongly of lime. Cracker malt with some vanilla. Back end has a soapy combination of lime and graham cracker. Light body. Kinda gimmicky. I find myself searching for the key lime pie flavor instead of just enjoying a pale ale. Whether it comes together as a key lime pie flavor is debatable. It drinks pretty well either way.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

4058,"2016-11-14",4.3,"(Cannette provenant de la brasserie): Tout est là, même a croûte biscuitée et la sucrosité de la meringue. Cest assez délicat, on est pas dans le territoire de Funky Buddha. Une touche épicé, vanille et une sécheresse honnête sajoute.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"

4058,"2016-10-14",4.1,"On tap at the Fermentaria. Pours a hazy yellow with a thin yet luscious white head. Strong aroma of lime juice and graham crackers. Sweet but has some hops for balance. I was leery of this one but its well done.","Havertown, Pennsylvania, USA","jmm635"
4058,"2016-10-14",4.3,"From a few cans purchased at the brewery. This could have gone really well or really bad.... luckily it was the former. Pours a light milkshake color... you know the one if youve had TH beers before. Mouthfeel is light. Lemon/lime aroma. Taste is exactly as advertized. IPA with graham crackers (very mild) and key limes. and it all works well together. Just a super fantastic beer. Super easy to drink with lots and lots of flavor. Damn!","Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","dagimp"

4058,"2016-10-07",4.2,"Got in a BIF from oline73. 16 ounce can into signature tulip glass, no can dating. Pours very hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big lemon, lime, grapefruit, tangerine, passion fruit, pineapple, lemon/orange peel, pine, vanilla, graham cracker, wheat, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical hops, lime/vanilla/graham cracker, and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, lime, grapefruit, tangerine, passion fruit, pineapple, lemon/orange peel, pine, vanilla, graham cracker, wheat, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine/grassy/citrus peel bitterness and light lime tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, lime, grapefruit, tangerine, passion fruit, pineapple, lemon/orange peel, pine, vanilla, graham cracker, wheat, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical hops, lime/vanilla/graham cracker, and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero astringent hop flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/grainy/sticky, and slightly resinous balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.5%. Overall this is an outstanding fruited IPA! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical hops, lime/vanilla/graham cracker, and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the modest bitterness. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
4058,"2016-10-01",4.1,"Pours hazy golden orange with a one finger white head with nice lacing. Aroma is of lime, citrus, tropical fruits, bready biscuit malts, light sweet malts, and some light vanilla. Taste is pretty similar to the aroma. Has a medium body with a creamy, velvety mouthfeel and a semi dry,semi bitter, long finish. Overall, a excellent APA that actully kinda of tastes like a key lime pine.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","skmikeg"
4058,"2016-09-29",3.7,"Pale golden pour with a thin white head ..... aroma of lime, graham cracker, vanilla bean .... taste is of lime, graham cracker, vanilla bean with a sweet frosting flavor on the back end ... has a light citrusy hop presence orange mostly ... has a light bitterness .... finish is like a vanilla cream with a lime kiss .... more of a fruit beer to me and a good one at that","Penndel, Pennsylvania, USA","italianjohn"
4058,"2016-09-24",3.9,"Aroma - lime citrus, graham cracker, and some yeast. Amazingly there is a slight bit of that crème associated with the pie.
Appearance - the body has multiple shades of yellow in the deep its a rich sunglow, and on the edges where light comes in easiest its maize in color. The head is off-white and about a 1/4"" and fades very fast.
Taste - is soft and has lime, crème, sugar, some graham cracker, and slight bitter hops. Quite amazing that could be captured in a beer.
Palate - medium body, creamy texture, soft carbonation, very slight bitterness.","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"
4058,"2014-04-17",3.7,"Poured a darker orange color with aromas of light lime, a touch of vanilla and light floral notes. Flavors were key limes with some grain and a touch of vanilla, light bitterness in the aftertaste.","Florida, USA","burg326"
4058,"2013-12-27",4.2,"crazy. tastes like a slightly less-sweet key lime pie. the lime comes off slightly herbal, close to mint, but stays in line. cool fucking beer.","Washington, USA","lachrymalisis"

4058,"2013-12-22",4.4,"Pours white and orange misty unclear with a white head. Aroma is perfect, big key lime notes mixed so well with hops and not overpowering. Flavor is delicious, balanced full bodied IPA with citrus hoppiness and lime Showing so well.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"

4058,"2013-12-22",4.2,"Murky orange color with a medium sized, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of brown sugar, toasted malts, floral hops, citrus, tangerine, vanilla, and pine. Taste of citrus, toast, grapefruit, pine, toast, vanilla, light lime, and a rindy, fruity finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
4058,"2013-12-22",3.2,"murky tangerine, large bubbled ring forms fast when the head drops to an oily top. Orange and mango nose, sawdust/Graham cracker lingering, playdoh with warmth. Flavor is pillsbury doughboy soft, saltines and lime brightness contrasting up front before milky grains mid and a soft, soapy finish with vanilla and pie crust accents in the oily slick, lightly synthetic cardboard finish. Theres lime juice throughout, but it never melds. Too conflicted.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
4058,"2013-12-22",3.8,"Growler shared by b3shine. Poured hazy golden color with an average fizzy white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate to heavy complex lime pie aroma. Medium to abundant body with a sticky texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy creamy lime sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet lime finish of moderate to long duration. Refreshing complex brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
4058,"2013-12-21",4.3,"Draft at Tired Hands with Linh. Pours a beautifully rich, hazy orange juice body with light white lacing. Aroma is citrus hop initially then followed by lots of lime, vanilla and light funk. Mouthfeel is creamy and pillowy with notes of lime, vanilla and citrus hops. The finish is dominated by graham crackers which really adds to the overall impression and execution of the beer. Incredible.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
4058,"2013-12-19",3.7,"32oz growler, filled 12-15, enjoyed 12-18. Shared by b3shine. Hazy yellor golden color. Minimal white head. Couple dots of lace. Awesome creamy cheesecake, lime aroma, very spot on key lime pie, but a much better texture, body, and overall flavor than, say, Shorts Key Lime Pie. Light to medium body. Super smooth, crisp lighter carbonation. Awesome zesty, lightly tart sweet taste. Light hint of spiciness in the finish. Awesome stuff, very tasty and unique.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
4058,"2013-12-18",3.9,"Growler shared by b3shine. Pours a hazy golden color with a small white head. The aroma and flavor have some sweet malts, pale malts, lime citrus, soft vanilla, grass, mild bitterness, some graham cracker notes.

4058,"2013-12-18",4.0,"Swing top growler to snifter (shared by me with the group; thanks Kerry!). Looks good; a cloudy gold with thin white lacing. Smells good too; hops, limes, and light vanilla. Tastes like it smells with a bit of graham cracker. Nice and light on the palate. Great stuff!","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
4058,"2013-12-15",4.0,"Sounds crazy but this is really good. Pours a pale amber with a small head. The aroma has a lot of citrus with a good bit of sweet malt. The flavor has a nice malt base and then the citrus comes in. Very dry and refreshing.","Sicklerville, New Jersey, USA","keepersj12"
4058,"2013-12-12",3.9,"Growler, a few days old from the source. Murky orange brown with sparse, spotty froth. Its not pretty. Nose is lime zest and juice, pine, musk and graham. Mouth watering with a sour tang that tweaks my nostrils. Watery medium body with a building pucker. Taste is big on the lime blending seamlessly into the grassy, musky hops. Crusty notes fade in and out with the vanilla adding sweet balance. Cool brew.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
4058,"2013-11-10",4.3,"From the source, poured hazy, murky golden with small off-white head. Aroma is lime shavings, zest and moderate vanilla. Flavor is lime juice, graham cracker, bug juice, margarita mix, cleaning agent and pie crust. Epic flavor and nose to this offering from TH. Lighter carbonation with a medium to full body coming from the cask. The normal version of this was so insanely good but the novelty and execution of this one make it close in quality. Cheers Jean.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
4058,"2013-11-09",4.1,"Cloudy straw-orange body, medium sized fluffy off-white head, soapy lacing. Nose is bright lime, with some graham crackers and a trace of vanilla bean. Flavor profile ties in more graham cracker and also starts to show some of the hop profile from the base beer (pine and resin). Medium bodied, gentle carbonation (on cask), somewhat juicy from the limes, mild bitterness. A bit of a novelty, but it works!","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
4058,"2013-11-08",4.2,"Pours a hazy blond with a thick and creamy white head...great retention and lacing. Lots of fresh lime in the aroma with just a hint of graham. Flavor has assertive lime atop nice mild graham and nice earthy hoppiness...just a hint of spice peeking through. Mouthfeel is medium and the finish is dry and earthy/bitter and limey. I prefer the regular version but this is awesome.","The dub c, Pennsylvania, USA","reggiedunlop"
