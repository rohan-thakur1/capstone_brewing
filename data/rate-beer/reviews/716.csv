716,"2016-07-23",4.0,"Red rye IPA by BrewDog, can from De Caigny. Lightly lacing, creamy, dense, regulary shaped, pale yellowish beige head on top of a deep and warm vermillion red-hued copper beer, clear but with disperse darker yeast dots throughout - so minute that they are barely visible to the naked eye, but rendering it equally (yet only lightly) misty with the sediment added. Lovely bouquet of pink grapefruit flesh, biscuit, tangerine, marmelade, cedar needles, black pepper, spareribs, bitter honey, hemp and dried mushrooms. Lively onset, fruity hints of redcurrant and mandarin with light dried mushroom-like umami hint and hop bitterness already manifesting itself from the start; medium carbo, full but smooth and slick, bit resinous mouthfeel. Pleasantly biscuity malt middle with a soft toasted edge and paired with the expected soft spicy hint of rye (as in moist rye bread), supporting a very hoppy, long, drying finish bringing tonic water- and strongly grapefruit-like bitterness as well as a wave of retronasal citrusy, piney and spicy (even very slightly minty) aromas; malt bittersweet accent goes down into the throat along with this generous amount of hops and leaves one completely satisfied.
