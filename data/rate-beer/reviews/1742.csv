1742,"2017-03-20",4.1,"The Pour: Pours a light honey-brown. Two finger head (it died down a bit before I got the lighting right for the picture), with nice lacing occurring.

The Bouquet: Smells sweet with caramel, brown sugar, and allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg, with a touch of vanilla. Smells like what you would expect from a pumpkin pie custard. There is a certain sharpness to the nose as well. From the nose you can tell this beer has a little oomph to it.

The Sip: There is a burst of brown sugar that fades into the pumpkin pie spice and returns in the finish. There is a bit of alcohol bite that gives it a bit of bitterness, which is necessary to balance out the sweetness of the brown sugar. The roasted malt gives Punkin a woody vanilla quality that adds a certain warmth to round out the beer.

Mouth-Feel: Medium to full-bodied brown ale that doesnt overwhelm but still stakes its claim to the taste buds.

Overall: This is a solid choice for a pumpkin seasonal. I would recommend this with turkey or pastrami on rye, or watching the game with relatives on Turkey Day. A very well balanced brew, I would drink this year-round if I could.","Haddon Township, New Jersey, USA","MeadMuse39"

Biscuity toast, wet spruce, woody bitter lemon and a thin layer of dry mineral toffee caramels poised against each other for excellent balance in aroma - a notch less malty (and geared more towards India Pale Lager) than Samuel Adams Boston Lager. - Thin toasted caramel biscuit body, all crisp for a session. - In terms of modern Viennas, Boston Lager has more caramel and rougher herbal hop edge, Berlins Lemke Original more malt character.

Tapped out a nice thick head of close, foamy, creamy bubbles for a beautiful head on a prohibition-era ale.

Color was a deep clear amber, likely closer to about 14ºSRM.

Nose is bold and full of roasted malty flavors.

Carbonation is pronounced and buoys up the bold malty flavors. The palate is all about these nicely roasted good quality malts.

There is some residual hoppy bitterness in the finish, balanced beautifully to be an awesome palate cleanser. You get more and more of the hops with each mouthful. A very pleasing lager and easy to see why this is a hometown favorite.

There are some nice boutique floral finishes which is a little surprising for a boiler maker type ale; lilies, orchids and a nice dry finish of chrysanthemums.

1742,"2015-05-20",3.4,"Aroma is dry and woody. Taste is a good balance of dry rustic malt and bitter malts with a kiss of citrus. Taste is actually a little hoppier than a Boston Lager, and I think the malt mix here better. Im a fan of Boston Lager, but Bookyln takes this one by a little bit on taste. Unfortunately, in many area anyway, this costs more, so Boston usually wins the battle to wind up in my fridge. Finally on sale for less, though, so I revisited the Brookyln Lager for the first time in 6 or 7 years. They should make an effort to match Sam Adams price wise- its clearly the market they are going after outside of New York/New Jersey (Where its a local beer), displaced people from the New York area (Taste of home?), and the foreign markets that years of reading beer forums have indicated that these guys like to export to (I guess having an American craft beer from Brookyln creates prestige for stores and those drinking it in some countries overseas, and being in a zillion different countries even if only in token amounts creates prestige for the beer). I mean, those three audiences they are targeting arent small. Its a business model. But if they could bring down prices just a little bit, they could be competing for fridge space in the refrigerators of Americans who just want a decent craft lager and dont have any nostalgia for New York or Brookyln or anything.  I dont think most people who drink Sam Adams Boston Lager give a fig about Boston.","Maryland, USA","CharmCityCrab"

S: Light malty smell of medium dark bread and slight floral hop scent. Very light aroma overall. Gets slightly fruity after warming for a bit.
T: Wheat bread maltiness and the English hop flavor combine almost immediately for a nicely balanced taste. Classic Vienna style lager IMO. Very drinkable.

The taste is a little thinner than I would have expected, but a good flavour, of malt with a mix of some mild bitterness, overlaying some malt sweetness, mild pine resin hops, with a lingering mild bitterness. Damn complex for a lager, and thats what wins the points. Solid.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Helsdon"

This is especially atractive now that it's available in a can here, which means you usually get them fresher. Pours amber with a finger of off-white and fluffy head, slight chill-hazing. The aroma is balanced with a malty backbone clad in an elegant east coast hop dress. Medium roasted and slightly caramelly malts, some pine resin, and herbalness. Light to medium bodied palate on the dry side, fresh, medium length with a perfectly balanced and refreshing hoppiness. This won't knock anyones socks off, but it's always a nice beer.

1742,"2015-02-20",3.0,"The looks will mislead you. Its not a smooth Vienna Amber lager, its a full throttle American style dry-hopped lager. They say its the original receipe of the pre-prohibition lager they used to brew. The body is thin, though, and the dry hopping gives not the same effect you might hope, having American IPAs in mind. But its not an IPA! Its a lager, dryer than European ones, a bit scratchy and unfortunately a bit too flat.
This beer is more a question of faith Its so much better than the thin Buds and Michelobs in the US. And that alon makes it loveable. But its not a top beer either.","Vught, NETHERLANDS","TheFoamhead"

Arôme : Directement on sent que cette American Lager a un profil malté, combiné par des houblons floraux, citronnés.
Apparence : Un bel ambré avec des reflets doré avec un col mousseux très léger, pétillant qui glisse rapidement sur le verre.
Goût : Le malt caramel se marie à merveille avec les 3 houblons Hallertauer Mittelfrueh, Vanguard et Cascade. Cest rond en bouche, une texture résineuse, avec une carbonation légère, le finish est amer mais moins quune Bitter traditionnelle. La gorgée finie, le malt caramel reprend possession de votre bouche, le côté sucré se développe et lamerture toujours présente vous fait saliver.

Pours a warm and pretty orange blonde colour, clear with very quiet sparkling on tiny bubbles, under a creamy, dense, yellowish, quite stable head leaving attractive lacing. Aroma is on the weak side and mostly reveals American hoppiness, with hints of grapefruit, orange peel, mango, caramelly malts, walnuts, biscuit, tobacco and perhaps a faint hint of iron. Smooth, slick palate with medium carbonation, soft onset of dried fruits and caramelly malts, nuttier in the middle, finishing in a citrus peel-like, somewhat peppery hop bitterness of relative length, through which the slightly toasted maltiness shows up as well. This style seems the bottom-fermented equivalent of the English pale ales and bitters, and this one is very true to it. Nothing extraordinary, just plain enjoyable. Could drink this all night.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

1742,"2014-08-09",3.9,"Transfer from BA review on 10-9-12-
 Poured from bottle into pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours ac copper-amber color with a two finger white head. The head fades rather slowly to leave a great level of lacing.

 Smell- The aroma is of a lightly roasted malt with some caramel sweetness. Mixed with these aromas is a light but nice blend of a herbal and floral hop aroma.

 Taste  The taste started out on the crisper and breadier side. Quickly a caramel sweetness greets the tongue and sweetens the flavor. These flavors persist throughout the taste until more towards the end. At that point an herbal and floral hop flavor comes to the tongue. While they start lighter, they grow stronger and stronger, and in the end, leave a crisp and bitter flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body is on the slightly chewy side for the abv. and style with a carbonation level that is rather average. The chewiness, while not characteristic of a lager, was actually very nice of the herbal and floral hop flavors. Overall the mouthfeel was great.

 Overall  A good herbal and floral lager that is crisp and delicious.","","Darkmagus82"

Appearance: The body has perfect clarity, showing off active carbonation bubbles in the amber body. The head is stout but dense and persistent with a light tan hue. Very nice looking beer.
Aroma: The aroma is on the light side with a mild malty sweetness with hints of bread and caramel. Theres a subtle hop aroma, slightly floral as well.
Taste: The intro is malty with a mild malt sweetness but its balanced by the mid-taste by a sort of herbal tea-like dryness. The finish continues building on the herbal qualities, fading out the malts. The finish is dry and lingers a moment with a light tea flavor. Mildly bitter and nicely balanced.
Palate: Full-bodied with a good carbonation presence, fits to style.
Overall: This is one of the top amber lagers for a reason, its no frills and balanced very nicely. Subtle hops balance the malts nicely for an approachable drink even a macro drinker could enjoy.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

OVERALL: A companion piece to Sam Adams offering, though not as bold, big or bountiful; a solid mix-pack filler, a session beer for certain, and definitely versatile enough to be a plus at parties where macros are offered mindlessly....","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"

1742,"2014-01-19",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 12, 2015 A respectable all-around lager, not all that sophisticated but it’s a straightforward drinkable brew. Malty aroma and lighter amber color, appetizing lacing. I think I finally really know what biscuit malt tastes like now thanks to this brew. Good flavor balanced by some bitter hops that occasionally reveal some floral notes. Savory maltiness is the highlight, coupled with a cool finish. Medium-bodied with good carbonation, but occasionally seems a bit watery. At any rate quite enjoyable, hard to find in some locales but a fine example of the style.

1742,"2013-12-27",3.4,"bottle after S. Boston Lager, 
 By coincidence it is the same style as my previous review, so its twice interesting to compare. Totally different brew. This more reminds kind of pale ale with more sourness in taste, but again - not in aftertaste at all. Cause thi beer on nose is unknown malty to me I presume this is Vienna malt oriented with indeed more amber ale similarities, velvety thickness, Pours amber-light orange with thick small bubbly top, light lasing, medium sustained. On nose its more deep but not complex, almost no hops to me just tones of citrus-pine but not hoppy. Flavor seems like amber ale, really - not as lager beer, no clear maltiness, fruity esters there are. Light herbal bitter in aftertaste. Palate - above average body, thick, compote texture, soft carbonation, light bitter plus minimal sweet finish, minimal dry.

Comments: This one is a lot more expressive and tasty than Sam Adams Boston Lager, as it leans towards premium lager a bit more. Yet it preserves all the elements typical of Vienna.

1742,"2012-07-19",4.3,"One stubby mid last year was enough to put a wide grin on my face, and leave me hankering for more. A stunning example of a beer done right, with pretensiousness cast aside. It produces a deep, orange amber and with a slick, almost oily presence as its swirled upon the glass. Fine, streaming carbonation breaks to atmosphere under the weight of a solid, rocky and messy snow-white crown. Piney, floral and zesty hops, bitter grapefruit, lime zest and under-ripe honeydew mixes with sappy honey and bold, toasted and biscuity melanoidins in the alluring aroma. Perfumy, floral and musky on first sip. Big hop presence, fresh and bright. Balancing, rich biscuity, toasted malts and honey overtones give it a firm and rounded mouthfeel. Lemon and lime zest grip the sides of the tongue with inklings of camphor and eucalypt coming in from the hops. Quite bouncy, the carbonation aiding the volatiles in the crisp, but exceedingly long hop and malt finish. Bitterness is not alarming. Everythings in harmony on this one. A delicious lager. One of my new favourite session beers!! (35,5cL, BBE 01/12, Mane Liquor, Belmont)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Bernsteinfarbenes Lager mit ordentlich Schaum guter Standzeit. Ein florales, süßmalziges Aroma. Im Antrunk butterweich dank wenig Kohlensäure und vollmundig.

1742,"2012-06-29",3.9,"Pours a gold amber with a white fizzy head that is quick to dissipate, but if you pour to fast it gets foamy. Smells of yeast hops and malted barley with visibly fizz in the glass. Well made lager in that it takes the elements hitting you with hops and then finishes with the light, pale malt. Yeast is prominent and makes it taste not as bland as some others, does have a creamy mouth and serious carbonation. One of the best for its style. 

As compared to say Yuengling, (which I was drinking last night) the focus is much more on the hops and yeast while the pale malt is in the background. The pale malt is much more prominent in most lagers. I thought this was almost like an IPA when i was new to different beers but now I see how it fits in to its bland genre.

If I hadnt joined this site in August 2006, I wouldnt have touched this beer with a Barge Pole, (I had drank Bud, Olly, Blue Ribbon, Coors and few other watery products from your shores previuosly and vowed never to drink such crap again) but I am now trying American beers again, if the price isnt too high. 

Poured into my Veltins 0.2litre stemmed glass (twice), it looked a lot darker than the lagers I normally see in Europe, not the straw blonde norm at all, this looks like a real beer! Deeper tones of old gold with an off white head. 

Aroma of hops and yeasts, a lot stronger than any other lager Ive had, and Ive had more than my fair share, this is good stuff. 

Bitter and malty taste, this is very, very good stuff in deed. 

Good retension of flavours, a strong almost heavy aftertaste where the hops re-assert themselves. 

This is one of, if not the best lager I have ever had and I dont mess with those sort of quotes (see some of my other reviews). It is also the first time I have had an All-Malt Lager, so am I being unfair to European brewers? You can add German and other European Pilsners to that list, as I consider them all to be in the same basket. So well done Brooklyn and American All-malt lagers.

SAPORE		VOTO (1-10)	
il fruttato quasi scompare, lasciando una leggera sensazione astringente che si mescola con sentori erbacei dati luppolo di chiara provenienza USA. Il tutto a smussare una struttura maltata dominante, con note tostate e caramellate. Finale secco con retrugosto tendenzialmente amaro			
TEXTURE		VOTO (1-10)	
corpo medio, morbida in bocca, media carbonatazione			
COMMENTO FINALE		 VOTO (1-20)	
dopo tante ales, si ritorna al mondo lager, in stile vienna, poco frequente, anche se sotto una prospettiva  totalmente differente. si ritrova una base di malto consistente che fornisce volume e morbidezza in bocca, con toni biscottati molto puliti e piacevoli; si insinua discreto ma efficace lamaro dei luppoli, con appunto laggiunta di toni erbacei non propiamente teutonici. risultato positivo ben bilanciato senza cadere in una sovre-luppolatura di cui spesso peccano gli americani. per il mio gusto personale  ringrazio la mancanza di toni troppo fruttati in bocca e avvertiti invece al naso che facevano presagire una lager molto - troppo - aromatica. una carbonatazione un pelino più consistente forse non avrebbe stonato. ottima a pasto grazie ad un bilanciamento pressochè perfetto che la rende molto versatile... e scende che è un piacere.","(Madrid","molly75"

1742,"2011-09-05",4.4,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Pint.

Appearance: Clear, light copper with thin but sustained head. Light lacing.

Aroma: Fairly dry, with toast, caramel, cherry and floral and citrusy hops.

Taste: Nice malt backbone of toast and caramel with almost no sweetness. Hops are quite apparent and include nice floral notes from the noble hops as well as an unusual blast of citrus due to the cascade hops. Great use of dry-hopping for a typically simple lager.

Palate: Moderately high carbonation with a fairly light body. This is a very crisp, clean and dry beer; quite simply, perfect for this type of beer.

Overall: Other than a couple Pilsners out there, this is about as good as an everyday lower alcohol lager can get. This should be bigger than Sam Adams Boston Lager.

Pour yields a brew with an amber body and a pretty big off-white head that leaves behind gobs and gobs of lacing. Head goes from a few fingers to a nice, stead half-finger. The nose has some light malt and a bit of earthiness. Nothing too complex, but its done well. The taste improves upon this with a nice dry malt presence and a bit of light earthy hops. Slightly bitter in the finish. Seems to be part hops and part tannins. Body is light to medium. Good carbonation as well. Drinks really quite well. A solid brew that I thoroughly enjoyed.

1742,"2010-11-06",3.6,"UPDATED: APR 26, 2013 Finally trying the original Brooklyn lager!  Damn, 200 + ratings and couldnt believe I have never rated one of the ""standards"" in the craft community.

This Vienna-style lager is fresh and full of nice flavors, but not a huge fan of the hop selection that comes with the Vienna.  It is good to finally rate one of the classics of the craft industry.  A great session option.
Original rating 11.6.10 - Re-rating: 4.26.13 - Finally getting back to rating one of the classics.  Still one of the best session brews of all-time!  Smooth & delicious.  Im going to have to add a few points on my initial rating of 3.4 (+ .2).","San Diego, California, USA","matthewjk"
1742,"2010-11-06",3.7,"Poured up on tap at the Tampa Pourhouse with clear deep gold body and thin off white head. The aroma is fairly spicy with hops as well as some floral, thick sweet caramel and butterscotch. The taste has a chewy rich maltiness mixing with firm spicy hops, some floral hops, a mild level of caramel, some esters and a cloud of diacetyl hovering around the edges. I think the perceived butterscotch like note adds rather than takes away from the experience. Nice lager.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

First thing I noticed is the hoppy smell. It is quite strong and spicy. Its colour is a clean copper-orange with a big creamy off-white head that has great retention. The carbonation is pretty active and the lacing is thick and patchy. The taste shows how strong the hop is, as this one has bite. Good spicy bitterness that stays a bit, but then goes clean all of a sudden. Very nice, and refreshing, but this one really tastes like a very good ale.

1742,"2010-04-12",3.9,"Its hard to find a truly good lager. And by ""lager"" I mean a more traditional American-style lager rather than the many niche European (-style) bock and pilsner varieties. American lagers are unfortunately associated with ""The Big Three,"" which isnt fair to GOOD examples of the style like Brooklyn Lager. This beer has everything the typical American beer drinker wants in their beer: good flavor that anyone can enjoy, combined with easy drinkability and a body that isnt too heavy.APPEARANCE AND AROMAI poured a 12oz bottle into a tumbler. Brooklyn Lager makes its distinction known right off the bat as the beer pours to a pretty shade of clear, dark amber/copper. Its not overly-bubbly like so many cheap adjunct lagers tend to be. It has an off-white, frothy head that lasts throughout the life of the drink and leaves noticeable lacing on the glass.The aroma is also a lot different than you might associate with an American lager. Its quite strong with floral hops and a touch of sweetness. While mild overall its still inviting by virtue of the fact it doesnt have that typical ""beer smell"" to it.TASTEWhatever flavors youre used to tasting in a ""Big Three"" lager you wont find them here. In fact, Brooklyn Lager has a lot of tastes that caught even me off guard. First of all, the head imparts a rich creamy texture followed by a slight caramel sweetness and the beer finishes with a gentle hop bite. Its unusual for lagers to have such hop distinction to their palates but Brooklyns hops are difficult to ignore.The beer does have a slightly dry, bitter aftertaste as these hops seem to linger for a few seconds but quickly dissipate. Some brews like this tend to dry out the mouth, but this one does not. DRINKABILITYIt should also be noted that this beer is only medium-bodied, but drinks like something much lighter. The palate is actually quite mild and the mouthfeel is thin, and it finishes with the smoothness of a velvety stout. If you drank Brooklyn Lager blind you might mistake it for a high-end ""lite"" beer. At only 5.2% ABV this is a beer well worth investing in a 12-pack for parties, BBQs, sessioning situations or just as a regular in your fridge. The satisfying taste and high drinkability would make it an ideal beer to pair with dinner.FINAL THOUGHTSBrooklyn  Lager is a perfect gateway beer for Joe and Jane Six Pack as well as yuppies, frat boys and party girls looking for something more satisfying than the usual ""Big Three"" without the intensity of a more high-end craft beer. Beer geeks will also appreciate and enjoy its craftsmanship and find it truly satisfying.NOTE: WATCH THE VIDEO VERSION OF THIS REVIEW AT:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTP_7ofH-PY","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

P- High assulting carbonation with thin body. Somewhat watery at first.

1742,"2009-11-19",3.8,"Totes itself as the ""Pre prohibition style beer,"" and I can imagine that description to be quite accurate. 
Nice, deep gold, lightly copper color with a fluffy, creamy, tan head. Excellent hop aroma, grassy with a slight citrusy nod. The malt is there as well in the form of a raisin-like, bready aroma.
Nice body, not too thin, not too heavy. Wonderful hop flavor comes first, then the sweetness of the malt blends in. This beer is somewhere in between a Sam Adams Boston Lager, and an Anchor Steam beer - having the best characteristics of both!","New Jersey, USA","JoeAgain"
1742,"2009-11-16",3.7,"This may well be the richest lager Ive ever had...far from a delicate balance of some golden lagers, this beer is full of flavor, and is definitely differs from its delicate cousins.  It pours amber, and is nicely balanced, with a ton of toffee and butter noticed, balanced nicely with some hop bitterness.  Aroma was pretty mild, but more malty than hoppy, with the sweetness of the toffee notes and the buttery diacetyl cutting through.  Mouthfeel was nice and clean.  A nice beer.

1742,"2009-06-24",3.3,"UPDATED: MAR 14, 2010 Location: Updating this rating with a 12 oz bottle, 3/14/10 


Aroma: Caramel malts, fruit, bread, floral and grassy hops

Appearance: Clearish copper-amber color with a lacy white head

Flavor: Clean malty flavor, light hop presence as well, balanced

Palate: Smooth and clean, drinkable beer, light-medium body, quite sessionable

Overall Impression: 
A flavorful and highly sessionable lager, a good example of the style.  I dont have a ton to add to the old rating, other then what is written above, my opinion hasnt changed too much on this brew.  Ill up the appearance from a 2 to a 3 and leave the rest alone.

Overall Impression: 
Definitely a solid example of the Lager style.  A nice amount of floral hops give this one some taste and distinction, a pretty nice beer.  7,2,7,3,13","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

1742,"2009-06-15",3.9,"***review from Aug 5, 2007***
Just noticed that the best before date is March 07....I cant imagine how great this beer must be when fresh. On the previous bottle I had, the pour was incredible and I was giving it a 10 but I was suspicious cause the glass was producing a cloud of endless fine bubbs that gave the brew an inch thick creamy cap the entire way so I decided to get another bottle into a different glass. This time the pour was equally good producing a large, thick off-white cap but this time the effervecance was almost nonexistant and the cap did not last. Left some sticky messy lacing and retains a ring. The beer is a medium amber colour and slightly hazy. The aroma is excellent and comes across quite refreshing - thick English style malts, good level of sweetness which is all blended perfectly with the soft floral hops. WOW. So chuggable! Well blended combination of caramel and biscuit malts, obvious spice and bold hops (apricotish) - more hops than I expected for the style, but a hell of alot less than the overhopped West coast stuff. Mouthfeel is ok and the carbonation is average. Medium bodied. The malts put a thin coating on the stiff hops that glue to your mouth. Great beer although Id question it belonging in the standard lager category. Nice looking label! Another high quality offering from Brooklyn. Drink up.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

1742,"2009-06-08",3.8,"Dam just noticed this brew expired a four months ago hope it still be good to drink. Body appears to be brown combined with burnt orange, a quarter inch cap was produced with excellent retention for a lager, very nice looking brew. Aroma is good but for a lager its not exactly fitting the profile but yummy smelling none the less. Lots of milder floral hops, tons of malt, and the typical grainy qualities found in lagers can be found in the delouses aroma. Very nice flavor the malts have a much darker taste and this a touch more bitter then what I was expecting, the hops are very noticeable and come across very flowery. The more I drink the more I can taste the malts and they seem to have a lemony taste in them. For a lager this dam good maybe a touch to much hops for the style but it works, the only real complaint I have about this brew is it is slightly watery but I shall let that slide because this is dam good.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","Cirrhosis"
1742,"2009-05-25",3.1,"This one caught me by surprise.  At a local bar I ordered it b/c I was in the mood for a lager and I had never had this one before.  Expecting something light with mild flavoring this was more like a Sierra Neveda Beer beer than a light lager, and I say that as a compliment.  It is definitely dry-hopped with an aroma you smell way before your nose gets to the glass.  For a lager it has a medium body and a clean crisp finish more like a pale ale.  Definitely a beer I will be drinking again.","USA","JerDawg"

1742,"2008-07-31",3.6,"UPDATED: AUG 3, 2008 Having gotten home from working both my jobs today, I decided what better way to relax then through quaffing my Brooklyn Lager. I also rather enjoy a crisp lager with my sushi if I cant have sake.

Poured a clean golden yellow from 12 oz bottle into my lager glass, leaving a good layer of foam on the top which still lingers, though clinging more to the sides of the glass. As I go to enjoy this liquid bliss, lemon and hop bitterness wafts through my nose. I dont feel much of a malt presence, though the hops are crisp yet mild enough to be smooth, not front and center like with an IPA. I taste a wee bit of malt, but overall lemon zest and hop crispness and spice play across my tongue. theres a hint of something else...maybe cinnamon apples...maybe from the malt... the overall profile for this very drinkable lager though is one of lemony zest and crisp hop flavor that tingles across the top of your tongue as it heads to the back of your throat.

1742,"2008-06-14",3.7,"A blast of herbal / menthol hops greets my nose as I pop the tab on this can.  The pour from the can produces a one-finger thick, lightish tan colored head.  The beer sits in my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip with a murky amber appearance, that takes on an orangish hue when held up to the light but remains deeply hazy.  I shouldnt have poured the entire contents of the can as the initial portions of the pour were quite clear.  The aroma is quite hoppy; it definitely has an herbal hop focus, but there is just a hint of citrus zest here as well.  Grassy grain notes become noticeable as do notes of crushed malt and soda crackers.  The herbal hop component is a mix of light menthol, clean hemp oil and a fresh cut herbal note.

This has a solid bitterness to it that only becomes more biting through the finish of each sip.  Grassy grain and herbal, almost grassy hop notes intertwine.  A touch of malt sweetness comes through in the middle and finish, but doesnt really intrude on the hop focus of this beer.  Herbal hop notes that are a mix of notes, none of which stand out nearly as much as the overall herbal presence; touches of rosemary, menthol, green hay, wild flowers and a finish of grapefruit zest.  Easily quaffable, but not watery; this has a certain presence / heft from the malt, but is still quite drinkable.

This has a huge hop profile for a traditional Vienna (which of course this is not trying to be), and it is quite a nice addition, the fact that this is dry hopped comes through quite nicely with the vibrancy of the herbal / spicy hop character.  This is a really nice beer, a perfect accompaniment to the 106°F / 41°C heat we have here today.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Aromas were admirably balanced between the surprisingly upfront hops notes and the caramel malts. Plenty of citrus and floral hop aromas combined with toffee, biscuit and caramel. Mouthfeel was moderately full, fluffy and very smooth with a refreshing amount of carbonation. Taste profile was quite APA like with plenty of citrusy/floral/spicy hops coming to the forefront, but it still maintained the clean delicateness of a lager.

Crystal clear copper with a lasting off white head.
An overwhelming perfumey hop aroma with a scant amout of malt.
The hop flavor in the beer is just not really what I was looking for.  I wish it was a bit closer to neutral.  Again, it comes off as perfume for flower petals, with toasted malt in the trail position.  Strong bitter finish.
Medium body with active carbonation. and a dry finish.

The aroma is pretty consistant with that of a pale or amber ale. Very hoppy. Grapefruit, other citrus. Some malts as well, although nothing stands out overall there.

1742,"2007-06-16",2.8,"The aroma is actually hopped, thank you Brooklyn. Its also got some biscuit/bread like yeast and malt. The appearance is amber/gold with a medium head and nice lace. The flavor is like the aroma with an assertive, bitter (tinny and grassy) taste to go along with the bread malts and a slight bit of paper. The palate is as smooth as any I have had from a lager.

Great perky hoppy nose to this, I wouldnt know how it looked because rather shockinlgy I was that thirsty I decided to just drink this from the bottle (shame on me) It tasted  very good though and despite the hoppy nose, this wasnt as hoppy or as bitter as I anticipated in fact I felt that it had rather a nice layer of honeylike sweetness to temper the bitterness and there was plenty of flavours going on in there but my gulping greedyness probably didnt do it quite the justice it deserved still it was very nice.","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"

1742,"2007-06-11",3.9,"Bottle, Tesco. Ive walked past this dozens of times, thinking it was going to be just another of the boring American lagers that seem to be the main representatives of the US beer scene in England. So finally when this went on sale I thought Id give it a shot, and wow--this is great stuff! Copper pour, nice layer of snowy white. Heavy herbal perfume, pollen, fading roses; the charming smell of classy old ladies. Full herbal hop bitterness. Shockingly hoppy actually--the hoppiest thing Ive had in at least a month. (Part of the sensation is probably that Im not used to this sort of hop flavors being used prominently.) Carmelly sweetness very tied in with the particular quality of the hop flavor. Chewy hop finish. A really pleasant surprise. Joins SNPA in my own little pantheon of respectable, full-flavored American brews available across the pond.

Its a bit similar to their east india pale ale. The head is a bit better and more creamy than the most lagers (this was from a bottle).

All in all a great lager with taste! (To quote a fellow rateberian). I still wish they wouldnt filter their beer, but I guess thats because they try to be a bit mainstream.","DENMARK","uhre"

Brooklyn Lager poured a crystal clearhoney golden with handfuls of big carbonation bubbles rising to the head. A 2+ finger fluffy meringue like white head formed on the pour as it slowly receded it left sticky patch lacing down the pilsner glass. This is a really good looking beer.

Aromas of toasted malt greet the nose up front. Along with a nice even dose of grassy hops and a tea leaf like quality. Clean fresh smells.

Flavor is much the same as the aroma. Lightly toasted grains lead the way and are quickly followed by a nice balance of grassy herbal hops. The tea leaf character is in the flavor as well but more subdued. 

Medium bodied but crisp and smooth. Good carbonation keeps this beer moving through the palate.

Very easy drinker. Could see myself polishing off a few bottles of this today.

High quality sessionable beer from Brooklyn. Brooklyn just recently came to Illinois and Im looking forward to trying all of them I can get my hands on.

It hits you mainly in the aftertaste. The beer goes down smooth, not too thin for a lager actually.

Tasted Blind, March 2007. Volo IPA Challenge Mystery Beer 
Bottle. Bright orange copper body, small creamy off-white head (3+). Perfumey floral hops in aroma with a bit of alcohol presence as it warms. Pleasant bitterness, same floral from the aroma with light citrus. Creamy but light palate. Flavour is a touch airy or washed out depending on your generosity.

1742,"2007-03-05",3.5,"355 mL bottle from LCBO.  Served cold in a tulip glass.  MR 01/07
App.:  Clear, medium-dark amber, tight, foamy tan head.
 
Aroma:  HOPS (citrus, floral and green-resinous), some sweet malts in background.  

Palate:  Medium-light body and fairly full carbonation.  

Flav.:  Plenty of green, resinous hops that becomes grapefruity, a bit of roasted malt behind that (caramel and toffee).  A decent bitter finish.

Overall a touch unbalanced towards hops, but still plenty nice.  Im happy that the LCBO is bringing in some decent American beer.","Nepean, Ontario, CANADA","probstblueribbon"
1742,"2007-03-05",3.8,"Nice light amber.  Bright white, extremely fine head stays throughout.

Beautiful bready malt nose, with a touch of treacle.  Medium in the mouth, with less malt sweetness than the nose leads one to expect.  Good spine of bitterness balances the malt richness.  Long finish.  Just beautiful with food.  Solid beer.  I like this a lot.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","RealAleDave"
1742,"2007-03-05",3.4,"Bottle- Pours deep amber/auburn, with anm average beige frothy head. The aromas are super fresh spicy hops, floral, perfume, and some slight caramel, butterscotch. Pretty spicy and hoppy flavour profile, cirtus, thrills gum, some bready/doughy malts, cookie. Probably an americanized version of the style, which suits me fine. Spritzy, hoppy finish.

A nice copper amber ale with a thick lacing off white head. Surprising nice floral hops in aroma with light biscuitty malt. In mouth, this is a fresh hoppy pils, with dry crisp malt, floral hops, medium bodied. You can taste the hops upon burping. This was a great acquisition by the LCBO.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"

1742,"2007-02-28",4.1,"Other ratings seem to be dead-on for this one...tastes more like an American Pale Ale than a Vienna Lager...hops are right up front, subdued in the back of the palate by malts...tastes  extremely well-made, and as such, everything is well-balanced. Huge head poured, with a beautiful copper in the glass. Smooth carbonation.

Beautiful reddish-gold and a short fizzy head that leaves the glass lacier than my aunties panties. Crisp, very hoppy and tart aroma right off the bat, a complex bitterness that runs the gamut from flowery to grapefruit-like. A solid malt (butterscotch, toast) presence -- maybe a bit of corn syrup mid-sip, but it dissipates into a satisfyingly bitter finish. A bit minerally as well. Tastes much more like an APA than any lager Ive had, but still has that German lager bite to it. Slightly slick and sticky. Impressive and quite well-crafted.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","shintriad"
1742,"2007-02-22",3.4,"Bottle: Poured a brilliant orange-amber lager in the flute with a decent 3 finger sticky off-white cap which lasts and laces well.

Aromas are of sweet toasty malts and floral Pacific hops...delicious!

Medium body silky mouth feel malty-floral pale ale -like character.

Up front a chew on big toasty malts then almost instantly this is balanced off with a rush of bittering hops which take over the balance mid palate...side tones of apricots...finish is bitter-sweet as the malts give up and let the hopping go metallic.

Interesting twist on a lager...certainly not a Vienna or a German style at all..uniquely an American hybrid style...this beer is hop-forward and bright, sharp and ale-like..floral, spicey-bitter ...even has an apricot bouquet pale ale nose to it...very much like a cross beween pale ale and a sturdy steam beer...Malty, sharp and hoppy very refreshing but I like my lagers more malt pronounced and complex.

1742,"2007-02-22",3.1,"I tasted this lager with a few pre-conceived perceptions that proved to be incorrect.  It came in a rubbish bottle, which is always off-putting, though one does say never judge a journal by its cover!  It is also touted as New Yorkshires number one beer - everyone knows New Yoykers are stupid, small-minded people with no taste, so this did not bode well!  I am quite happy to hold my hand up and say ""look here Flashy, your pre-conceived perceptions of this lager let you down.""  It has a dark amber colour, bitter sweet hoppy taste, which stays on the palate.  Absolutely bally tastey!  This beer gives lager a good name and tastes more like an American pale ale in the mould of a Sierra Nevada - it certainly does not taste anything like the mass-produced lagers served in the UK.

Flavour maltier than aroma, though the hops are still dominant, and lend a mildly bitter finish to the brew.  Delicate carbonation.  This is remarkable for a lager - more reminiscent of some good ales - the whole package reminds me especially of the Anchor Liberty Ale.

Aroma is shocking for a lager, especially in this bland Ontario market - its fresh and floral hops all the way, with a nice bready malt character in the background. The flavour has a much bigger malt profile than the aroma, with that same breadiness and some sticky sweetness coming forward before a pleasing bitter/dry finish. Smooth drinking all the way through. Nice hop-forward aftertaste as well. A fine example of what a lager can be - they dont have to be fizzy, piss-yellow and boring.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","StompBrockmore"

Its bottle has an attractive label. Oddly, the beer  smells like a pale ale or IPA, you know, the aroma of fruity hops astern.  Has that typical pale-like medium hoppy asperity.  The finish is mild to medium coup de main and it lasts for a few moments. This certainly is not your typical lager. If it didnt have a style listed, I would say it is more like ale, possibly even american pale ale. Gone, in a moment!

Their brews are always aromatic, tasty, and true to the style.  I feel that they are above average and worth trying at least once.

______________________________

7/27/2008:  Brooklyn Lager pours a nice golden amber colir with a ample carbonation and a foamy, lasting ivory-colored head.  The aroma is malty and characterized by a floral aroma with some citrus to it as well.  The flavor is very much the same with a lightly caramel maltiness balanced with a fresh, flowery and lightly citrusy hoppiness.  In addition to the hop flavor there is also a good level of bitterness that helps create a delicately dry finish.  This beer has a medium to medium-full body that is really smooth.  Brooklyn Lager is very flavorful, crisp, refreshing, and extremely satisfying.  I am always impressed by this and the other Brooklyn brews everytime is sit down with one to enjoy.

1742,"2006-09-02",3.2,"The truth is I am really not a personal fan of this type of lager. That said, this is much better than almost any other American Malt Lagers that Ive had. 

Appearance: This beer pours a coppery light brown, decent white head.

Smell: Raw barley was the overwhelming aroma. There was also malts, and a bit of green (hops) in the nose.

Taste: I found the taste to be a bit watery, with lots of empty space. Light malts up front with a quite hoppy aftertaste. Above average compared to American Macros but certainly not a very interesting beer in comparison to other craft beers or American All-Malt Lagers. Aproachable.

Mouthfeel: A bit thin and watery; typical of an American lager but certainly nothing special in the mouthfeel (just okay).

Drinkability: There is nothing very interesting about this beer but it is cool clear and refreshing, like water. It is definitely a significantly sessionable beer, with low ABV and no extreme flavors you could drink it all night; and still walk home (w/o stumbling).


Hope this is helpful.

Decent linger, average body for the type, almost astringent mouthfeel, gets a little ""dishwatery"" by the end of the bottle.

1742,"2004-12-26",3.2,"UPDATED: DEC 27, 2004 (12 oz bottle, obtained in trade with shadey, thanks Shane!) Not just your generic lager, this one has a lot of flavor.  A toasty, malty, somewhat sweet flavor is nicely balanced by a mildly bitter hops, which prevents the palate from getting too sweet and tiring.  But as the beer finishes, it takes on more characteristic flavors of a lager.  It starts off nicely, but doesnt finish as well.  Malty, lightly sweet nose smells a bit like an Oktoberfest.  The color is light amber and slightly cloudy.  Smallish off-white head fades to a rim after a bit, and theres only a few specs and dots of lace on the glass.  So dont let the label fool you, this is much better than a generic lager.  That fact may account for what I think are inflated ratings.  In the end, its still a pretty average microbrew with some ""lagerish"" tendancies in the finish.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

During a much needed pit-stop, I enjoyed two excellently poured pints of this Lager accompanied by a heaping order of pommes frites with curry mayonaise.  This is a filling and smooth, albeit pretty typical lager.  Hints of toasted nuts and citrus.  Hopsy, but not overboard.  A little bite never hurt anyone.  Good head and sweet aroma.

Suddenly you are in a moonlit clearing in a deep, green forest.  Just you and the golden dew of the coming dawn, which you decide to drink. You become a worshipper of the golden dew, and join with others dancing in the moonlight and singing to the moon.  The moons name is Garrett.  It answers, worship me, for I am the Great Garrett.  I shall supply you with the Golden Dew as long as I am placated with sacrifice.  But what kind of sacrifice, oh Great Garrett? you answer.  I demand little.  Only a 1952 DeSoto, with blue simulated leather seats.  Oh Great Garret, my DeSoto has seafoam green seats, but you may have it.  Not good enough, answers the Great Garrett, I must therefore demand the ultimate sacrifice. You and all of the moon dancers must chop down the mightiest tree in the forest with a...wait, thats been done before, sorry, ok you and your fellow moon dancers must consume nothing but Smirnoff Ice for a thousand, thousand lifetimes.  Then, and only then, will I supply thee with more of the Golden Dew.  And so it was written, and so it was done.  And for a thousand thousand lifetimes, the people drank Smirnoff Ice.  Twas a dark and tasteless time, but after much suffering, it was over.  And the Great Garret joined the Brooklyn Brewery and fulfilled the destiny of the moon dancers.

Well balanced malty to hops…maybe just a bit hoppier than expected. Reminiscent of Samuel Adams Boston Lager in style and flavor but better. The bottle calls this “The Pre-Prohibition beer.” If so, they knew what they were doing back then. It’s difficult to classify this beer to a particular style though. Definitely not a Pils and the hops are too evident for a Munich, Dortmunder or Vienna. Whatever it is, it is good. The amount of hops in this beer is on par with a fine American pale ale. Excellent job. I really enjoyed it.","Maineville, Ohio, USA","Beer Guy99"

I found a little of that in this beer. It was a little more flavorful than I expected. However, it still missed the mark. Id rather have a Czech lager. It was three steps up from the traditional, American Lager though.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
