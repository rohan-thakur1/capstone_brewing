3416,"2017-01-28",4.1,"November 16th, 2014 - The Cuvee de Jacobins gets round I think, since it is one of the most reviewed beers in Brouwerij Bockor¬ís line up.

I get cherries, barrel wood, strawberry shortcake, cherry pie filling, and even the more subtle nuance of a pinot noir. A considerable amount of time is spent taking in the bouquet of this beer - more than average - and with it a little warmth has moved from my hand to the brew. Appreciably sour, the flavor is acidic but intertwines this acerbic quality with flavors beautifully. A whirling cascade of bubbles also whips into the mix, blending the sugared watermelon notes with the fresh cherry tastes to create a fruity, rich beer that is also light enough not to weigh the drinker down.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Strong cherry fruit character in the taste as well, moderately tart, but balanced slightly by a vanilla caramel sweetness. The flavor doesn¬ít seem too heavy on the oak. Alcohol seems low. The carbonation is just strong enough for the style, and the body has a touch of syrup-like character but is mostly clean with a light to medium thickness. 

Overall a very nice example of the style. The flavor is quite intense and enjoyable. While the light sweetness gives a good balance, it hangs slightly in the finish, and I think I would have preferred it to lean even further in the sour direction.

3416,"2015-03-07",3.4,"Attractive ruby red with copper highlights, a tan, one-finger head that lasts a few minutes before vanishing in true lambic form.
The nose is vinegar, sour cherries and hints of vanilla oak. The palate doubles down on the vinegar, with suggestions of celery, cucumbers and peaches joining the cherries, along with acid and traces of leather.
It¬ís sour without being mouth-puckering, with a pleasantly slick feel. But it also gets in its own way. There¬ís underlying sugar that doesn¬ít compliment the sourness so much as fight through it. And the vinegar becomes more pronounced with aeration, diminishing the potentially nice palate.
This is certainly OK, but a trifle disappointing.","","Pumpkin87"

3416,"2014-05-20",3.8,"From BA review on 2-19-12 - 
Poured from bottle into chalice style glass

Appearance ¬ñ A deep red-brown color which formed a moderate head upon pouring. There was a bit of lacing on the sides of the glass upon the loss of the head.

Smell ¬ñ A sour cherry aroma hits you up front and persists throughout the aroma. Toward the end a more vinegary aroma mixes in to the sour cherry.

Taste ¬ñ A nice sour cherry taste meets the tongue. The taste matches the smell quite nicely, and as soon after the sour cherry hits, a bit of more vinegary/acetic acid taste comes into play. It leaves a very bitter and sour taste on the tongue. While sour and bitter it is surprisingly very nice.

Mouthfeel ¬ñThe sourness mixed with the bit higher level of carbonation which when combined make it a a slower drinking beer. The thickness is rather moderate, but again, due to its sour nature, it is one to sip and enjoy over the long haul.

Overall ¬ñ A nice dryer sour. It has lots of sour cherry flavor and some nice aromas. A good slow sipping light abv. brew.","","Darkmagus82"

A - Pours a reddish brown with a thin cap of tan bubbles.

S - Very acetic sour aroma, old wet basement wood, good amount of funk, old bruised fruit, tart raspberries, some sweetness as well.

T - Slap your Grandma sour! There¬ís a brief second of sweet malt upfront but then the lacto sour slowly builds reaching it¬ís toe curling climax at the very end. Lots of tart and fermented fruit going on. Highly acetic but a great blend of light brown sugar sweetness. Raspberries are the most notable fruit. Salty wood and balsamic hit right at the finish.

M - Light bodied, crisp sour finish.

Wow this was lip smacking sour with just the right amount of sweetness. More funky brett presence than I expected. My favorite Flanders Red.

3416,"2013-06-20",3.8,"2013/06/20 - Pours a clear, deep red mahogany color with a foamy off white head. Aroma is vinegar, cherries, barnyard and smoked wood. Taste is very subdued compared to aroma. Tart cherries and lemon with a slight barnyard aftertaste. Oily body with low to medium carbonation and a puckering finish. Not my style, but a surprisingly smooth sour ale.

That sour/sweet/tart finishing sensation lingers, but not a ton of flavour lingers with it.  This is quite a nice sour overall, fairly low carbonation and an oily texture.

3416,"2013-05-26",4.0,"Poured into a tulip. The number ""01"" was printed on the back label, but I don¬ít know what it means.

3.5 A: Nearly clear burgundy color. Short beige head came and fell quickly. 

4.25 S: The nose on this is extemely well balanced. Great mix of fruity, earthy, and sour. Cherry and mixed berry start things off with toasted malts and a rotting wood funkiness not far behind. Acetic and lactic acid in good proportion to the other aromas. 

4.5 T: Taste is even better than the nose. Like the nose, the flavor profile is completely balanced to the point of perfection. Sour tinge that gets your attention, but doesn¬ít block out other flavors. Fruity cherry and berry via lactic acid. Toasty malts with a light caramel sweetness. Rotting wood and basement type funk and oak from the barrel. 

4.0 M: Lighter medium to medium body. Good moderate carbonation, which falls midway between spritzy and bity. Light pucker on finish.

5.0 D: Easily in my top five most drinkable sours. It¬ís not the most flavorful, but it is perfectly capable to keeping my taste buds entertained. The beauty of this beer is that I keep wanting more well after I finish my last sip.

3416,"2013-05-03",3.4,"Pours a very dark red body, almost brown. The egg-white head is very long-lived and ends up as a partially covering film and a foamy ring that leaves a good amount of lacing. The aroma is quite strong and sour, with mostly fruity notes. Once again I feel that my sour ale vocabulary is rather limited, but I think I find an interesting mix of tart fruits, like sour cherries, and more overripe stuff, like fermented apples. The taste is initially light sour, and the sourness increases in the finish. There is hardly any sweetness, and any bitterness in the finish is covered by the sourness, an acetic feel and a moderate acidity. The sourness and the acidity might be a bit demanding, but the flavours are actually quite gentle and easy to like. There are hardly any complex barnyard notes or anything like that, it¬ís mostly nice fruity stuff. Again tart cherries, fermented apples and lots of acidic lemon. Also some apple cider vinegar. The mouthfeel is very refreshing. The body is medium, the texture dry and smooth and the carbonation is moderate. A nice one for the summer!

The beer is orange to copper in color with 1/2"" of off white head.

The aroma offers cherry pie, cherries, pie crust, oak, vanilla, stone fruits. It also smells musty, in a positive way.

The flavor is a mixture of sweet and sour cherries. Yum. Why have I not tried this before?!? Additional notes of vanilla and a bready, pie crust. Delicious beer.

The feel is acetic and sour, but not overly so. A touch of vinegar in the finish.

Overall, this is a beer I would like to have a case of in the cellar, so I could pull one out and enjoy every now and then.

3416,"2012-12-24",3.5,"From the singles cooler at Lemon Tree. For a $2 bottle of Belgian funk, what have I to lose? Spicy notes just from pouring it into a small chalice. First idea is of cinnamon, or perhaps coriander and clove. Close up, I only get a hint of sourness, mainly a note of sweet malt and just a little fruit juice. Reddish brown reminiscent of an old bottle of cherry juice, which is kind of to style, thin fizzy head. Taste has some sweetness to it, but there¬ís the sourness, too. Mostly cherry, smattering of cocoa. The tartness comes in waves, sometimes puckery, sometimes like SweeTarts candy. But never overboard as in Warheads candy.

Heavy sour cherry that never ventures into the ""sweet"" territory with strong doses of vinegar and malt. The finish leaves the top of the mouth feeling the sour sting for quite some time after the swallow. Carbonation was mild but fitting. Wish I could get this regularly.","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"

A: Pours a transparent mahogany with a light hay colored head. The body is bubbly and supports a nice frothy head with solid retention. The finally subsides to a thick collar and leaves some splotchy stick.

S: Tart grape skins, cherry pits, slight acidic berry. Earthy malt and oak flavors. The nose is spot on.

T: There is slight pucker up front from the acidity, but it quickly gives way to sweet malts, tart cherries, and dry grape skins. There is an earthy oak flavor towards the back end and the tartness sticks to the back of throat.

Grape candy(not real grape), and tary, giving off more of a processed candy aroma than traditional sweets.  Taste is sweet until the sour patrol hits you seconds later.  Unique and unlike anything I¬íve ever tasted with the label ""beer"".  Almost like a liquid version of warheads or shocktarts.  Gone in minutes it drinks so easily.

Starts with a sweet cherry lean, one that turns green and envious rather fast, with a sour apple middle that rolls into a tart, rich, deeply-oaked finish.  The oak and sourness linger on the palate for ages, despite a rather brisk carbonation.

3416,"2012-04-28",3.4,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2012 Sampled on tap at the Hay Merchant, Houston TX; April 2012
The beer arrives from the tap topped by a creamy, amber tinged, tan colored, one-finger thick head. The beer is a concentrated amber color. The nose smells primarily of lactic acidity, with a backdrop of fruity notes that hint at cherries. There is a touch of oxidized malt richness here as well some caramelized malt aromatics. 

The flavor is definitely tart, even leaning towards sour. It is quite dry up front, but does pick up some sweetness and even an acetic bit as it moves towards the finish. The acidity is predominantly lactic in character, which is good. Other flavors of cherry, some earthiness, maybe a touch of oak and some astringency are noticeable here.

3416,"2012-03-05",4.1,"From notes.  First reviewed 6/28/2011.  Served on tap in a tulip at Hopleaf.

This comes out with a dark brown addition to a cherry color, with just a little light able to sneak through. An off-white ring is all the head I get.

From the aroma, I can tell this one is going to be sour. Great tart cherry aroma, with a bit of raspberry, vanilla, and oak. The vinegar nature of the beer is already apparent.

The flavor is fully tart, there is no doubt about it. A robust dark orchard fruit blend is led by red cherry, with a good amount of vanilla and oak adding some depth to the flavor without getting in the way of the strong vinegar and tartness. After a few sips, my taste buds recover from the tartness a little bit, and sweet cherry and raspberry flavors are noticeable at the beginning of the sip. 

This is sour and acidic enough to keep me salivating from first sip until five minutes after I am finished with the glass. Still medium bodied, with lightly bubbly / lightly creamy medium carbonation. A tannic dryness finishes out each sip.

This really connected with what I was after at the moment. The combination of dark fruits and a fire hose blast of sour really rocked my palate.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

3416,"2012-01-31",3.9,"Bottle:  The aroma consists of moderate cherry, light funk, vanilla, lemon, and a touch of oak.  It pours a dark copper that is mostly transparent when held to the light.  It has a small off-white head that diminishes fairly quickly to a thin film outlined by a thicker ring.  The flavor starts with moderate tart cherry.  The finish turns sharply sour cherry along with some lemon, light vinegar, vanilla, and a touch of oak.  Lightly sweet cherry lingers on the tongue for a little bit.  As it warms, the sweetness becomes a little more prominent and mellows the sourness a touch.  It¬ís medium bodied with soft carbonation.

I knew I had to come back for this after the staff at Lizardville was raving when it went on tap during a previous visit a few days prior. I am glad I did - this ranks right up there with Rodenbach Grand Cru as an excellent example of a Flemish sour. Striking that fine line between sweet and bone dry one pour of this will highlight any evening.

Aroma and appearance - A mysterious blood red body sparkled like the last vestiges of light battling against the rise of the moon. A dusty white head looked like flecks of dirt on a pristine winter snowfall. The sour burst of cherries pulls no punches about the intent of this beer. Tart and vinegary it is almost as sour as a good lambic.

Flavor and palate - Tart vinegar and cherries bite at the tongue. Nipping the taste buds with a robust sour intensity rivaled by few other Flemish beers it is not meek. By the end of the glass every corner of the palate is crying out for mercy. I would love to see this resurface again as it deserves a revisit.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3416,"2010-08-01",4.2,"Murky mahogany in need of a good polish and dull garnet lurk underneath a fluffy head of tan puff while lace wanders hither and fro. Lifting the taster to my nose reveals a cornucopia of red apple skins, kiwi, apricot, granny smith tartness, red and black plums, green grapes, and black cherries; hold the syrup please. Phew! Tart and sweet, backing her up is a solid cast of melba, bread crust, and burnt sugars, especially of the brown variety. Her tart character nips at the back of my nose with each snuff, and I have to fight to remain seated. I am a sucker for sour, after all. Smitten, I willingly go in for the kill. She is gentle at first, a lure to bring me in further where she hits me head-on with a rich middle and silken finish of cream, vanilla, and frothed milk. Her finish leads me right into the next quaff where I revel in plum, green, and red grape skins, delightfully bitterly acidic and tart. Green apples, granny smith especially, round out her middle before surrendering me once more to her silky finish. As my tongue squeals in tart delights, black and red cherries with pits crunch between my teeth. Her malt backbone is a silent partner which is just fine with me. Instead, I revel in an increasingly acidic presence tempered only by her creamy vanilla finish. Exquisite. I could sup her all day long. After my hefty 10 Commandments from Lost Abbey, she was a wonderfully timed refreshing treat.

I tried this beer against Rodenbach Grand Cru, and, though it wasn¬ít quite up to that world class beer, it still had a quite good showing.

This beer smells and tastes of raspberries, cherries, oak and sour.  It¬ís actually not too far from the Rodenbach beers - perhaps three quarters of the step between normal Rodenbach and the Grand Cru, though without that beer¬ís lovely feel.

I tried this along with the Ommegang Rouge, also brewed by Bockor.  They were indeed very similar with one being slightly more cherry taste than the other (can¬ít remember which).  But only slightly so and that was probably due to the difference in the age of the beers.","Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","dagimp"

At first the nose has very little, as it warms some tart berry aromas come out, cherry and cranberry mostly, red grapes, a little funk, a little hay, a little bit of citrus fruit.  Flavor is spot on for a sour: bitter from citrus fruits, tart from the acid, strong lactic acid flavor, sweet ripe fruits, slight funk, toasted grain, a little splash of wood.  Finish is tart, bitter, sweet and dry.  I liked Ommegang Rouge better based mostly on the aroma but the flavors were also more developed.

3416,"2009-08-26",4.3,"On tap at Beachwood for Sour Fest.  So, there are obvious similarities to Ommegang Rouge here (which was ALSO on tap!), being as they are both made by Bocker.  First, may I just say that that is not a bad thing.  Compared to the latter, this beer pours a bit darker (a dark amber-brown), and has, I think, a bit ¬ìdarker¬î of a flavor.  Aroma is tart cherries, toasted malt, oak and firm acidity.  Flavor starts with cherries and smooth vanilla.  There is also some defined green apple and oak flavor that renders the flavor profile more complex.  This is not unlike how I describe Ommegang Rouge, though.  Palate had prickly carbonation, with actually stunted the flavors for a split-moment, then allowed them to come streaming out as it subsided.
