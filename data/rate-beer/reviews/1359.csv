1359,"2017-01-04",3.4,"Tap at U Slovanské Lípy, Prague. Poured a clear dark brown with a frothy off white head. The aroma is roasty malt, light dry charcoal, liqourice. The flavour is moderate liquorice bitter, light sweet with a crisp dry smoky liquorice bitter palate. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Having seen the earlier ratings I expected more. Its just all smoky malt and liquorice for me. Its brewed by a small microbrewery though so there may be consistency issues.","Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA","jmgreenuk"
