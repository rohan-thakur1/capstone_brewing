Pretty much just tastes like sweet, sugary goodness (hah!). Not too much booze, but certainly a bit. Kind of grainy. Just sweet and non-descript.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

2961,"2015-03-06",3.4,"January 30, 2015 - tasting session with blankboy, gregclow, jercraigs and mabel. Bottle. Clear refractive and bubbly amber-gold with a large and lasting fluffy white head. Aroma is boozy and a touch vegetal - but that subsides to sweetness and light perfume - pretty delicate for a malt likka - it should smell like PRISON; alternately ""a malt liquor should put hair where there aint and burn hair where there is, and reverse the hair situation of your taint."" You can use that one for free, Beaus ;-) .. anyway. Taste is sweet and a little boozy, just a hint of urinal cake cuz why not. Slick, alcoholic and slightly thin mouthfeel, not all that much carbonation - finishes pretty quick and not much aftertaste - interesting and fun, but I dont think I would have it again.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
2961,"2015-02-16",3.1,"2015-01-30. Yellow body with a decent frothy white head. 3+ Aroma is very lightly fruity, cereal grains. Flavour is on the sweet side, similar cereal grains, some moderately rough alcohol character but not too much considering the abv. Smooth average plus bodied palate, soft carbonation. 3+ Dangerously drinkable while chilled. As a malt liquor it is rather impressive, as a beer I might want to drink more of, not so much. Bottle shared by HogTownHarry Overheard: ""Why? Is it Neil Diamond? Cause thats about the only thing that upsets me.""","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"

2961,"2015-01-04",3.4,"600ml bottle from the brewery in Vankleek Hill, Ontario. Deep golden in colour with a thin white head, light lacing. The aroma is of caramel malts, some bread, cereal, fruity. The flavour is highly sweet, lots of cereal and grains, some honey and fruits. Finishes with a lingering sweetness, slightly warm. If only all malt liquors were this approachable.","Peterborough, Ontario, CANADA","radiomgb"
2961,"2015-01-04",3.6,"Sampled at the Aarow & the Loon. Pours a slight hazy golden colour with a white cap and nice lacing. Aromas are sweet and fruity malts. Much of the same for the taste, with a decent grainy finish. Eventually, caramel come out in the nose. Quite a pleasant mouthfeel with a lightly dry finish. This is a pretty nice malt liquor that feels like real ingredients instead of adjuncts. Really drinkable.","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"
2961,"2014-12-10",3.3,"Half pint at the Loon. Hazy deep golden with a thin white head. Sweet and grainy, a little boozy, a bit fruity...mainly grapes. Medium+ body with very creamy carbonation.

2961,"2014-10-13",3.0,"On tap in Fonthill. Clear coppery colour. Sweet sugar aroma with real barnyard quality. Sweetness follows through on the palate with more caramel and sweet notes but it does have a sort of pepper note that Im sure where it came from. Meh, it is okay but glad I tried it.","Canadiana, Ontario, CANADA","Bendrixian"
