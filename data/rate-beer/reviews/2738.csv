Solid but not overwhelming malt flavor with pineapple, pine cones, resins and a faint grassy touch. Full body and a nice carbonation level. Nice bitterness. Long finish with hops dominating. A pleasant, easy drinkable and tasteful beer. 160109","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

2738,"2015-07-10",3.0,"Draft sample. Aroma impression is fruit cocktail, pineapple juice, grapefruit, yeast, faint resin, banana, malt seemingly transparent in flavor and aroma. Medium-light bodied, sweet, syrupy and a bit goopy in the mouth with strong finishing bitterness and a nagging silt / grit quality. I like that they say equal parts Classic European and West Coast America, because this is pretty much nothing like classic European lagers, and everything like a hoppy, sugary western IPA.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Good body strength, with some residual sugars, some caramel flavor, and a massive amount of diacetyl, more than most other infected beers I had, and unfortunately undrinkable even for somebody tolerant like me.Undrinkable.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
2738,"2015-06-12",3.4,"Breakside Douglas Fir Lager on tap at Lingua. It pours a brilliantly clear deep gold. The nose is peppery, bready, slightly sweet & mildly hopped. A promising start to this lager. Medium bodied with a soft round carbonation and a crisp finish. The taste is really interesting, earthy, peppery, a bit of Apple/jolly rancher in the aftertaste... isnt that an off flavor? Dry wheaty biscuits, mulch like earthiness that evokes a forest plus some spicy character. Pretty good.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
2738,"2014-10-23",3.8,"Bomber. Pours a bright orange color with a small white head. A big fruit, pine nose. The flavor is sweet, huge pine, citrus, super clean. I think this is really a IPL.
