Piękna, gęsta piana.
Aromat waniliowy + delikatna kawa, czekolada i paloność
W smaku gorzka kawa łamana kontrą wanilii i cukru trzcinowego. Delikatna goryczka. W tle majaczy gorzka czekolada. Czekam, az Matuska wrzuci to piwo do beczek po dobrej whisky!

452,"2017-04-08",4.1,"Dodatki:  Laski wanilii 
 Kolor:  Czarny. Pod światło ciemnobrunatny, dość przejrzysty. 
 Piana:  Ahhh ta piana! Mógłbym na nią patrzyć godzinami. Rewelacyjna, beżowa, drobno pęcherzykowa. Tworzy jedną zbitą warstwę i nie widać gdzie się zaczyna, a gdzie kończy. Długi czas gości na widoku. Stacza się w dół do obfitej oponki.
Lacing umiarkowany. 
 Zapach:  Aromat przyjemny, dość trwały. Klasyka stylu.
Początkowo silne karmelowe detale, przypieczony spód od ciasta, odrobina ciemnego chleba i sporo czekolady.
Nieco w tle ziemiste, a trochę i nawet żywiczne nutki.
Wanilia wychodzi dopiero po ogrzaniu trunku. Jest bardzo delikatna. 
 Smak:  W smaku kawa, mocne espresso bez dodatku cukru.
Przy drugim łyku dochodzi do tego gorzka czekolada. Kolejno do bukietu dołącza karmel i orzechy włoskie. Tych ostatnich jest sporo, czuć ich ściągający posmak w ustach.
Wanilii jest niewiele, ginie ona gdzieś w czeluściach trunku.
Goryczka jest delikatna, finisz krótki kawowo-czekoladowy.
Co jakiś czas pojawia się lekkie poszczypywanie w język.
Piwo jest nisko wysycone w związku z czym pije się je niezwykle lekko.
Faktura jest umiarkowana.
Świetny Stout, bez dwóch zdań. 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 
 Podsumowanie:   

5-ty najlepszy Stout na świecie. Jeszcze do niedawna krążyły o nim legendy. Przez blisko pół roku szukałem tego trunku.
W końcu udało się go znaleźć na Słowacji.
Może nie jest to najlepszy klasyczny Stout jakiego piłem, ale za to świetnie wkomponowuje się w ramki stylu.
Mamy jak na tacy takie składowe jak: karmel, czekolada, kawa, przypieczony spód od ciasta, ciemny chleb i orzechy włoskie.
Jedyny minus jest taki, że wymienione w składzie laski wanilii są prawie nie wyczuwalne. 
Najlepszym podsumowaniem będzie fakt, że w pojedynkę wypiłem butle 0,75l i to w pół godzinki ;)

Jak ktoś ma jeszcze okazję spróbować ten trunek to gorąco polecam!","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

452,"2016-06-12",3.7,"750 ml bottle, thanks to Werckmeister!
Dark brown body, with a big, creamy, lacing, brownish head.
Aroma of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, nuts, some ash, some wood, some liquorice, dark fruits.
Taste follows this, slightly too light bodied for the style maybe, but still enjoyable.
Medium, a bit oily mouthfeel, with an average carbonation.
Finishes roasty, a bit bitter, with coffee, wood, cocoa, liquorice, subtle ash.

Very nice. Smooth and well balanced, with really nice chocolate notes, although not as full bodied as I like a Stout. On the other hand quite easy to drink. Overall a very good style example, but I was expecting even a bit more, not among my favourite Stouts.","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"
