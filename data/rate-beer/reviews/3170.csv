3170,"2015-07-26",3.4,"Bottle courtesy of Nisse666. This poor fella has survived in the fridge for quite some time but seems ok so going to rate it anyway after having used most of what was left when cooking. Pours translucent pale green with no head leaving some legs on the glass. Smell tiny grainy and slightly estery with boiled rice, cereal, bubblegum, peach cobbler, hay and alcohol. Taste is sweet, tiny grainy and slightly estery. Mouthfeel is tiny viscous, round, slightly boozy and medium bodied. Finish is sweet and tiny sour with unflavoured puffed rice, bubblegum, peach flavoured booze, hay, dry soil and hints of lemon peal.
