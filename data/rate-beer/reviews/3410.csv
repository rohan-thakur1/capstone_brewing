Aroma of black currant, blackberry, vinous port notes, lemon, oak, musty funk, slightly acetic balsamic character, lightly toasted malts, maybe a little sweet cola. Flavour is moderately high acidic (lactic and balsamic vinegar), lots of vinous character, a mix of port and tart red wine, black currant, tart cherries, dry oak quality, rather tannic, subtle Brett, just a touch of toast and chocolate from the malt. Finish is fairly dry with a bit of pucker and a mineral quality to balance the tannins. Medium-full body, slightly oily, with very soft carbonation.

3410,"2015-03-24",4.0,"375ml bottle courtesy of Reserve Membership. Assist via Mr. Nielsen. Thanks, bro. Finally coming full circle with the Nightmare series. Pours a deeper blacihs brown hue, a healthy hazed body with brownish red glow and plum, dark fruit colors shooting to the edges and bottom. Frothy light brown head sits atop, a decent layer dies to a thicker ring, nice enough lacing overall. Aromas show big dark fruit, pulpy blackberry and red wine meet tart and fleshy plum, tannic and oak and deep red wine. Dark fruit, earth, lactic pop is sour and lactic, a bit toasty and biscuity. Raisin, plum and prune meet those fleshy red grapes, some tannic grapeskin and earth, mellow funk elements. Initial is medium bodied, a bit slick and sour with distinct toasty elements, touches of balsamic and firmer oak. Sour plum and dark fruit, touches of blakc cherry, blackberry and red wine. Jabs of vanillin, oak, fruity dark depth is quite alluring. Yogurty life, tannic elements and sour twang comes in and out. A bit of gentle acidity, deep red wine, black cherry and plum. Really lovely stuff. Backend is funky, a bit dry and tannic. Plum and prune, cherry and red wine with that firmer lactic twangy feel on the backend, sufficient solid sourness with firm yogurt, a bit of toast and faint cocoa elements peeking through. Red wine, Port and earth meet some red grape, subtle biscuit and funk linger on. The oak integrates well and the richer lush dark fruit presence is complex and sour but not overdone not sweet and a bit brooding/underdone as some younger offerings can be. Lovely stuff, I think I enjoy this one the most from this series. The complex and deeper Port elements seem to integrate well, the fruit elements and sourness are on point. The more recent ones (Whiskey, Port) certainly seem like theyve come a long way compared to eaerlier barrels.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

3410,"2015-01-01",4.2,"Tap at the brewery; GABF weekend, 2014. On my second visit to the brewery, the Sunday after the festival. Black. Strong port aroma and also a lot of it in the flavor, but it does not have the sugar found in most port. Some earthiness; yeast, and a little tart. Also some berry flavor in the finish.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
3410,"2014-11-08",3.7,"On tap @ Beachwood Brewing. Just about black in color with a khaki head. Nose is rather fruity and almost jammy. A lot of vanilla, grape jelly, and sweet wine.

Tons of grape, berry, and plum. Somewhat malty with some chocolate.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

3410,"2014-10-26",2.9,"Pour is black with small amount of light brown head. Nose is lightly roasted malt, a bit of marshmallow, leathery brett, and a hint of vanilla and wood. Taste is extremely sweet, roasted malts are faint, some marshmallow, huge malt sweetness, really overtakes things. A fair bit of bitterness, light acidity in finish. Palate is a bit slick, moderate carb, bitterness lingers through the finish.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"
3410,"2014-10-18",3.6,"Bottle via trade. Pours almost black with no head. Aromas of dark fruit, some light unidentifiable berries. Taste is tart and semi dry. Flavors of sour grapes, wine, some Brett funk, some yogurt. All of this and yet it feels quite thin and lacking something. Finishes tart and slightly acidic. Pretty good, not world class.","Victor, New York, USA","MacBoost"
3410,"2014-10-12",3.6,"Aroma has a light roast and dark malt character with quite a bit of dark fruit, berry and cassis mostly but also cherry and plum. Moderate port notes with hints of alcohol. 
Pours a dark brown with lighter brown notes on the edges and a small, tan, head that quickly receded to the edges where it lingered for a bit. Light lacing and small legs. 
Flavor is moderately acidic with a light dark malt character. Moderate dark fruit notes with a light vanilla character. Medium light bitterness and moderate port character. Some light alcohol spice in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice dark sour, but still not a style I like. Nice port character with lots of dark fruit notes.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Aroma of vinous oak, yeast and malt. Medium to full body with flavors of port wine, oak and chocolate malt. The finish is tart with a port wine and oak aftertaste.

3410,"2014-09-18",4.1,"375ml bottle in a Cellar Reserve glass. Pours near black with a lacy, beige head. Aroma of light sourness and funk on the nose, port wine and oak, dark malts with roast and dark chocolate and hints of coffee, and notes of dark fruits.

3410,"2014-09-14",4.1,"The beer is pretty much black. Maybe just a bit of dark maroonish brown at the edges. A small amount of tan bubbles on top. Mostly dissipates after a minute. The aroma is big on vinous barrel character. Solid oak. Lots of fruit. Besides grapes, there are apricot, blackberry, plum, cherry and other fruit complexity. Good stuff. Earthy funk. Some gentle caramel sweetness and a light treacle background. The taste is mildly to moderately sour. Fruity and funky. Very little roast flavor, which I like - maybe, some extra fruitiness but its mixed in with everything else. Good oak. Very tasty beer. I was a bit worried about it being a dark sour, but theres not much dark malt character to it. Tasty.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
3410,"2014-09-11",4.2,"Bottle thanks to Tom. Pours a dark brown with small off white head that dimibishes to nothing. The aroma is strong port, oak, and roast. Medium mouthfeel with strong port, funk, vinegar, roast. Hides alcohol well, very good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"

Caramelized grapes, brown sugar, oaky, some tannins, black currants and cherries in the aroma. Taste is deep grapes, tang, heavy oak, caramel, port notes, and pears with a lighty sour finish. Medium body with high carbonation. One of the better versions of Nightmare for sure.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
3410,"2014-09-03",4.2,"Dark brown pour, tan head. This may be my favorite in the series to this point. The port barrels have muted some if the flavors that, at times, I find unpleasant in dark sours. A good dose of sour funk, rich balsamic, roasted malt, port, and molasses.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
3410,"2014-08-23",4.1,"Cellar Reserve Bottle enjoyed @ 45F split 2 ways in stemware. 

A - Pours nearly black out of the bottle, pitch black with a reddish hue on the glass. 2 finger sticky espresso head which fades slowly to some sticky ring.

S - Nose is very nice! Big grape, raspberry tart dry oaky aroma. Smells just wonderful. Theres a touch of roast...like a Port Barrel Tart of Darkness

T - This is a nice beer. Start tart and sweet with a lot of oak. Middle is merlot grape, oak and obvious sweet port. Roasted burnt wood and some olive brine at the finish. Port then sticks around for quite a while.

M - sweet,. oily and boozy. 

O - This is fantastic. Not as good as the Nightmare Grand Cru but its up there!","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
