2268,"2017-03-02",3.6,"On draft at Tap 25. It pours a dark brown color with no head. The aroma is very fruity with raisin, fig and plum.

2268,"2016-09-07",4.7,"Decadence 2012 version, 750ml bottle. Sampled: 8/19/16

Appearance: Dark translucent brown, thin beige head, and surprisingly no sediment.
Aroma: Dark fruits & spice (reminiscent of Cognac), unmistakably Belgian yeast, slightly earthy & herby.
Taste: Arrives with a blend of herbs, spice, & licorice. The middle reminds you that its a Belgian ale by bringing out a lot of earthy yeast with some cinnamon. Finishes with some dark chocolates, salted caramel, raisins, & dates; the dark fruits lasts a long time to create a lingering sherry wine note. Overall, its very close to what Olde Ale was.
Palate: Medium body, smooth, and slick; no carb; and quite hot with booze (I mean, its 12%).
Overal: Simply put, its a delicious quad that rivals any famous, legendary Belgian quad. The flavors, balance, & complexity are all there! The only thing missing is the yeast sediment of bottle-conditioning; that wouldve made it a proper beer to cellar away.","California, USA","beer_queue"

The flavors are rich and malty but not really overly fruity or nearly as sweet as I was expecting. Its nice.

Despite ample carbonation, the palate is a little fragile and fails to carry the depth of flavor. More dried fruit in the flavor with some offsetting toffee malt and yeast. Not quite the melange or depth that the invite suggested. Rising sherry warmth on the back-end.

2268,"2014-08-20",4.1,"January 4th, 2013 - The New Year is a naturally retrospective time, which is why a 2012 brew seemed a suitable way to spend a 2013 evening. Alesmiths 2012 Decadence was, I believe, a bottle purchase from the brewery purchase, made on a whim, and with a little financial and liquid courage. Like many of Alesmiths paramount pours, this slips from bottle to glass with a silky smoothness, and the sweet and subtle smell of cobwebs, settled dust, raisins, gown sugar, molasses and a thick, syrupy balsamic vinegar, and a powerful smell of intricate yet delicate yeast. The flavor adds to this powerful, pungent mixture with a distinct vanilla bean flavor, and a long, lovely, lingering aftertaste. The potential for caustically strong flavors is disarmed by a foamy and ""poofy"" aftertaste in the flavor, though this doesnt attenuate the alcohol into invisibility. But as expected, heavy sugars define the flavors here, with a thick, natural apple pie sweetness, pushing the boundaries between indulgent and cloying - basically, everything I like in a winter warmer.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

AROMA of buttered dark bready malts, rich toffee, sticky dark fruit, port wine, Belgian yeast, with noticeable tangy spice. FLAVOR of rich toffee and caramel, sweet grains, raisin and holiday candied fruit, a little chocolate, brown sugar, and finishing with some spice. A fair amount of sweetness as I would hope for in a quad, but far from cloying. The huge alcohol is well concealed, though does have a very noticeable warming effect. Overall the beer has a lighter mouthfeel than the 12% would imply. Another excellent anniversary effort from the always great Alesmith, and one of the best American-made quads I have had.

Masterfully-sculpted raisins morph into dark chocolate stuffed with date sugar in this most elegant, succulent Quadrupel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam covers the dark brown and its mahogany sheen.
-The aroma and flavor profile are so refined in this one; absolutely glorious definition.
-This may not be as effervescent as the Quads I know and love, but it doesnt detract from the pure pleasure of sipping to be had.
-The finish is pure malt bliss.

2268,"2013-05-25",4.0,"Poured into a goblet. 

4.0 A: Clear deep amber mahogany color. One and a half fingers of creamy/frothy beige head. Retention is very good given the ABV and a short ring of lacing is left.

4.25 S: Doesnt smell at all like a Belgian quad in that theres no earthy tones, but it still smells great. Intense caramel, plum, fig, and vinous grapiness. Raisin, toastiness, dates, candi sugar, tobacco, and brown sugar next. Toffee and booze underneath that. Great complexity with surprising strength. The aromas havent quite merged into a seemless integrated nose, but its still exceedingly fulfilling.

4.25 T: Taste is exactly like the nose. Lacking in integration and earthy authenticism, but plenty complex and super potent. Plum, fig, and grape again lead the way. Caramel loses a bit of strength and joins the ranks of raisin, toastiness, dates, and brown sugar. Tobacco, candi sugar, and toffee. Tastes like its ABV, but it isnt overbearing. Overall, quite enjoyable.

3.75 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation, which is spritzy but could be more so. Smooth enough. Good here.

4.0 D: Tasty brew that is good all around.

2268,"2013-04-26",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2013 Pours a pretty copper amber color with a caramel colored head.  Aroma is mellow and blended with allspice, pumpkin, mincemeat, and mild Belgian yeast.   The mouthfeel is comprised of both an underlying oily medium thickness and an overarching scrubbiness with the carbonation.  It probably needs to settle and warm a bit.  I will allow the second half of the bottle warm while I drink and review the first half.  Some well-blended and mellow flavors of mincemeat spice, fresh baked bread, ripe, dark fruit, and dark chocolate.  A very good effort.  A distant third for me after Westy XII and Rochefort 10.

Smell has a combo of yeast and bananas, but not strong, more subtle like dried bananas. Described as a quad, my mind had a hard time with the flavor until reading the bottle yielded that ""ah-ha!"" moment - molasses.

2268,"2013-03-10",3.4,"A steady pour into my Bruery tulip produces a three finger thick, amber tinged, full tan colored head that leaves lots of lacing stuck to the sides of my glass. The beer is a concentrated amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, ruby, cranberry-juice red hue when held up directly to the light. Lots of caramelized banana notes are in the nose, along with spicy clove, some woody pepper notes, perhaps a touch of ginger, and some nostril warming alcohol notes as well. Underneath the up front yeast character is a toasted and caramelized malt character as well as something that seems a touch metallic somehow.

Lots of banana flavors are followed by brandy like notes and a touch of alcohol vapors and spice. The beer is rich, viscous, and chewy, but has a prickly carbonation that is perceived as being much lighter than it actually is due to the body. Lots of caramelized, concentrated, maillard driven sugar sweetness is found in this beer; it is cut through just a bit in the finish by a not really roasted, but slightly astringent character, definitely some spiciness and some tongue numbing turpenes (including clove, and even a hint that leans towards paint thinner without being too strong). After a couple of sips in a row, and dulling the palate to the sweetness, a nutty, toasted maltiness, brown bread character, and chewy molasses cake character becomes a bit more noticeable towards the finish; it almost takes on a savory, almost smokiness at times. Underneath the banana are some notes of raisins and prunes.

Definitely a bit heavy handed with the banana notes, a bit too sweet, and perhaps a touch to phenolic and turpene like in the finish, but still not too bad. This is one that should actually age pretty well, and if the wood character is kept to a reasonable level, the barrel aged version of this is likely to be quite good. Had I know better beforehand, this is a beer I would have held on to for a couple years, as I have a sneaking suspicion that it will get quite a bit better, and will be quite a bit more balanced after some time in the bottle.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

However, the drink makes up for the lack of aroma by delivering a heavy dosage of sweet malts balanced out with a touch of spicy yeast.

Becomes rather fruity with raisins and perhaps some leathery notes in the middle.  Nice toastiness with a slight roastiness is also present.

Aromatics show clove, caramel, cola, and dried dark fruits; some assertive alcohol present in there as well, but it tends to quickly retreat to the background; theres an almond/Amaretto-like note present as well, adding an auxiliary sweetness that approaches vanilla. Medium levels of carbonation, a moderate acidity, and fine-bubbled texture thats endearing and focused; this tastes a lot closer to the top-tier Belgian quads than most American attempts. Layers of caramel, dates, raisins, and brown sugar at the core, offering much more than the typical cola crutch of many U.S. quads; additional notes follow with Amaretto, ripe red fruitiness, and some herbal/spicy bitterness that goes nicely here; overall a delicious, engaging quad thats a pleasure to drink.

2268,"2013-02-14",3.9,"deep chestnut brown, surprisingly clear when backlit.  Thick, creamy, luscious tan head.  Aroma is a sweet maple bread with a hefty vegetal and slight metallic note.  This mildly unpleasant attribute is also found in the flavor, albeit less prominently.  The flavor is very special, super smooth (so is the body) lightly sweet, a mix of maple and caramel (not really any molasses as advertised thankfully).  Theres a moderate finish of bread crust (! one of my favorite flavors in a dark Belgian) and light light grassy hops.  Light-medium body, but the low carbonation, silky-smooth mouthfeel makes it slightly heavier.  Very nice; Im not a huge fan of that aroma, but it certainly distinguishes itself from most american quads (which are invariably spicier).

Everything on the nose is there as well, with a cornucopia of flavors that blend very well, particularly the tobacco/booze combination. Full body, moderate carbonation, satiny soft and silky smooth mpouthfeel, and a long warm alcohol finish. Superb.","Pacific Palisades, California, USA","RedSox2004"
2268,"2013-01-24",4.2,"Draft at Alesmith tasting room. Wood brown in color with a small head. Smells really good. Oaky, malty, vanilla notes. Taste is super smooth... creamy low carbonation level but not flat... the taste really sticks to your taste buds. I love that about alesmith beers... Anyway. Taste is great as well. Rich maltiness, balanced by a nice hoppiness, really oakey, peat, moss and light vanilla. The high alcohol content is hidden well. Overall very enjoyable... Maybe someone will send me a bottle","Newark, Delaware, USA","GMCC2181"
2268,"2013-01-21",4.7,"750ml bottle from the brewery:  Deep burgandy color with a dense, but fading beige head. Aroma is dark fruit and light molasses. Flavor starts rich raisin and plum followed by hints of clove and molasses with a touch of sherry. Finish has a light dry black cherry tartness. Full body is rich and smooth with moderate carbonation. AweSome Quad!","San Diego (Mira Mesa), California, USA","papajohn"
2268,"2013-01-21",4.1,"Bottle.  Dark brown pour with some red hues and a very large and creamy tan head.  Aroma is dense, clean spices with light clove, slight roast (even smokey at points) and dark malt with bready notes as well as darker fruit notes like plum and fig.  Taste is very clean with heavy dark fruit notes, spices, minimal clove, slight bitterness from the alcohol, and darker molasses through the finish.  Clean, coating, and smooth mouthfeel.  Exceptionally balanced and clean for such a large beer.  This is great stuff and certainly worthy of a second bottle for the cellar.","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"
2268,"2013-01-20",3.7,"Dark amber pour with a small khaki head. Rich dark fruit and brown sugar aromas. Nice clove spiciness, chocolate, roasted malt, alcohol, and caramel sweetness. The flavor is sweet, but well balanced. Good roast and chocolate notes to go along with the dark fruit, caramel, and brown sugar. A bit of yeast, spice, and alcohol on the finish.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2268,"2013-01-19",4.2,"Bottle.  Pours a dark reddish amber, with a rocky off-white head.  Dark dried fruits (raisin, date, prune), candy sugar, belgian yeast, spice, roasted nuts, aged sherry, toffee, and with a long, dry finish.  Abv is hidden, just a pleasant warmth.  Very good quad, I will definitely buy more of this.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
2268,"2013-01-15",4.3,"750 ml bottle from Bev4less. Pours a dark brown color with amber highlights and a big khaki head that has fair retention. The aroma is rich with complex dark fruits; I get raisins, dates, plums, molasses and cola. The taste is similar to the nose, find the cola-like flavors to be very forward, with mixed fruits filling in the sides and back. Cloves are barely noticeable but for the numbing effect they have on my tongue. The palate is full and smooth with lively carbonation. Finishes long and a bit dry with some lingering sweet fruits. Overall: OK, I know that Im homering this, but wow is it good.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"
2268,"2013-01-09",4.3,"Bottle.  Pours a deep brown hue with an amber tinge.  Off white head that initially had thick bubbles but as it settle changed to fine little bubbles.  Aromas of dates, prunes, a little cola, and a hint of clove and banana.  Excited for the first sip.  Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied.  Served around 55 degrees in a chimay glass.  Flavors of tobacco, roasted nuts, a touch of cinnamon and hints of anise.  Effervescence of the beer tingles the palate and makes the sweetness a little drier on the palate.   Already tastes a little aged and not fresh which helps subdue the alcohol.  As others have noted, this is one of the best domestic quads out there.  The yeast profile is a little different, but uniqueness is always a good thing.","San Diego, California, USA","Sickboy282"
2268,"2013-01-04",4.3,"Draught at Alesmith.  Pours a clear mahogany color with a khaki head.  Aroma is raisin, candied sugar,  molasses.  Taste is sweet with some alcohol warmth.  A little dry and aome prickly carbonation.  Really one of the best Quads Ive had from an American brewer.  Superb.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","dcschiller"
2268,"2013-01-03",4.0,"On tap at Ale Smith brewery. Pours a red brown with an off white head and yeasty, fruity aroma. Taste is similar, yeast, fruits, bread, and caramel with a warming, long finish. Alcohol is well hidden, very drinkable, delicious brew","Coral Springs, Florida, USA","zgaier"
2268,"2013-01-03",4.0,"On tap at Ale Smith Brewery, pours a ruby red brown. Nose is fruity with some spice and yeast. Taste very typical of a quad, with a myriad of fruit and spice with yeasty notes. Alcohol well hidden, ends nicely. carbonation and texture medium.  Nice quad, from a  great microbrewer. Quaff Score 8 / 10","Coral Springs, Florida, USA","jjgmd"
2268,"2013-01-03",4.1,"On tap at Alesmith. Reviewed from a couple tasters.

A - sweet raisins. Nose is present and not overpowering. Hints of malt and toffee.

A - deep copper with minimal lacing.

T - ripe cherry and dates. Bready notes and brown sugar dominate the middle palate. Alcohol is well-hidden and only comes through at the very end. Esters and cloves hide nicely in the background. Finishes clean and immensely quaffable for 12% abv.

P - light to medium carbonation. A little on the thin side but still coats the mouth and lingers for a few seconds.

O - A tasty brew and definitely one of the better American quads Ive sampled.","Poway, California, USA","Enish266"
