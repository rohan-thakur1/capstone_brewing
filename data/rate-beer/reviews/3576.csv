3576,"2015-01-04",4.1,"Draft... This beer rocks! Pours hazy and pear-colored with a small, wispy, white. Decent retention. The aroma is both citric and grainy. Light to medium-bodied with stinging carbonation. The flavor is super tart with some graininess and a pinch of salt. Finishes crisp, tart and totally clean. As with nearly all goses (except Gravity Brewlabs) this could use more salt. No such thing as too much salt. Otherwise, totally delicious and crushable. Im with Dak; this needs to be canned or bottled and distributed. World class beer right here!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3576,"2014-10-25",3.8,"32 oz. Crowler from Homer321. First of all, LOVE these Crowlers! Hopefully they catch on. This one pours a hazy pale yellow with a tall but disappearing fizzy white head. The aroma is spot on with nice salty lemons, hints of lacto and fresh bread. Smells like summer. The flavor is equally good with salty/tartness up front followed by a bready malt base and a salty, biscuity aftertaste. The body is perfectly light and lively. A delicious beer no doubt.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
