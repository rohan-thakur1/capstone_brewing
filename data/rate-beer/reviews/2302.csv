2302,"2017-06-17",4.1,"Pours hazy dark brown to black with a lasting, foamy, dark beige head that leaves some lacing. Smells like roasted malt and hops. The aroma contains coffee, licorice, hops, roasted malt, wood, figs and raisin. It tastes medium caramel-like sweet at first, then medium hoppy bitter. The finish is roasted and light alcoholic, though the ABV remains well hidden. Medium body, oily/syrupy texture, soft carbonation. To me, this has a lot of qualities of an (Imperial) Stout, but that is another discussion. Basically, its a complex and well-balanced beer. Glorious!","Brugge, BELGIUM","nathanvc"

2302,"2014-11-20",4.9,"Bière noire de 10,3 % abv, classée en quad par le brasseur et ratebeer, mais qui se révèle être un imperial stout Prix au concours Brouwland 2014 de la meilleure bière amateur des plats pays
Tout un programme !
Couleur noir dencre, mais avec quelques reflets marron foncé.
Opacité quasi intégrale. Mousse beige foncé à café expresso, bien épaisse et crémeuse. De toute beauté.
Arômes de chocolat noir, café fin, noisette, pointe darmagnac et myrtille.
1ère bouche soyeuse et douce, à la prise forte sur du malt torréfié, café intense, tourbe, essence de pin.
Arrière-bouche bien maltée, très torréfiée, avec une fumée de cigare distinguée.
2ème avec des notes de bois de fût, et du genièvre fin, sur du malt torréfié.
Arrière-bouche longue, et nettement mieux intégrée.
3ème nez superbe, plein de finesse et détails.
3ème bouche beaucoup plus équilibrée, avec des fruits noirs, bois de santal, amandes, fèves sèches,
quelques herbes.
La longueur se développe sur des bois exotiques, avec du café expresso en retour, des fruits noirs,
fruits des bois, du sous-bois.
Les jambes sont grasses, longues, étirées.
La levure est très belle, épicée, un rien fleurie.
Lalcool est curieusement très supportable pour son niveau abv, mais il fait un bon travail sur les 
saveurs.
La finale donne du cake de Noël, des épices, une pointe de girofle, du câpre, de léglantine, et elle
est bien sûr beaucoup plus douce que lentame.
CONCLUSION : une bière qui est en fait un imperial stout, comme nous lavons dit. Les nez sont 
superbes, et léquilibre final témoigne dun grand travail sur les saveurs. Je voulais redéguster cette bière avant de la coter, et comme je le pressentais, ma seconde cote est plus haute que la première.

2302,"2014-11-14",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 15, 2014 The winner of a brewing contest for hobby brewers issued by Brouwland, Belgiums best known shop for brewing materials. As a reward for their victory, the Delhaize supermarket chain has incorporated it in their range this autumn, and that is where I found the bottle. Moussy, deep beige, thin but dense head with good retention, colour a very, very dark wine red, as good as black, hazy. Very malty aroma, bitter chocolate, cold black coffee, Irish coffee, concentrated beef broth, charcoal, smoked bacon, toffee, vanilla, wood (even though this is not barrel aged), dried plums, elderberry, liquorice, brown rhum, almond, coriander seed, lavender, dried leaves, dried rosemary. Dense and rich taste, sweetish at first with candied fruits, dried banana, caramel, fatty and syrupy mouthfeel, smooth and somewhat powdery, medium carbonation, sourish and lightly soapy wheaty touch, very much caramelly, nutty and chocolatey malty with smoky accent, finishing with leafy hoppy notes, coffee-like mouth-filling bitterness and rhum- and whisky-like warming, but in all well-hidden alcohol; the chocolatey maltiness (and even some cloying sweetness) and the wheaty sourishness remain the longest. Complex, intense and deep beer, very interesting and well-made for a hobby brew. In terms of style, I do have a problem with it: this is not an abt and even less a quadrupel, this is a downright imperial stout (though admittedly one could argue it does lack some body for this style). But who cares: its a nicely perfumed sipper, perfectly fit for an autumn evening. Curious to see what this beer company, if they already deserve that status, will come up with in the future. For now, Id call this everything but inglorious, but I do get the irony, of course.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
