4367,"2016-10-03",3.5,"650 ml bitte shared by Werckmeister, thanks!
Black body, with a quite small, fizzy, coffee-colored head.
Aroma of coffee, liquorice, toast, dried fruits, some cocoa powder. 
Taste follows this, with quite a lot of sourish fruits and some caramel. 
Medium, slick mouthfeel, with an average carbonation. 
Finishes medium roasty, medium sour-fruity, with cocoa, some coffee, some liquorice. 

Nice one, but not oustanding. A bit light bodied for the style and with some unusual sourish fruits, that arent bad though. Overall not among my favourite style examples, while still a nice one.","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"

4367,"2014-08-04",3.8,"Transfer from BA review on 8-31-12 - 
 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

 Appearance  Served a black beer with a one finger tan head. The head faded relatively quickly to leave a moderate amount of lacing.

 Smell  The aroma was of roasted malt with a good presence of chocolate and coffee. There was also a light caramel sweetness as well as some lighter more herbal hop aromas mixed within.

 Taste - The taste begins nice and roasty and remains that way much throughout. The flavors initially are of a coffee and chocolate flavor with a light amount of caramel sweetness (quite light). The caramel grows a bit in strength in the middle of the taste where it is met with the appearance of a light herbal hop flavor. The caramel however fades once again and the brew becomes even more dry toward the end. With the drying of the taste comes some notes of char and a nutty flavor, which when combined with the roasted coffee and dark chocolate from the start of the taste, leave a dark and dry flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer was on the average side with the carbonation there as well. A bit of a thicker body may have suited the dark flavors slightly better, but for the style and dryness I think it was pretty good. 

 Overall  Roasty and tasty. While one I would not take as a session beer, it is one to have every once in a while.","","Darkmagus82"

Aroma was alright. There was mostly chocolate and grain smells but they didnt jump out of the glass. Pour was a lovely deep dark brown/near black with a one finger tan head. Taste was very full and delicious. Strong hit of chocolate and bitter roasted malt at first contact. Some coffee flavors came out as the beer warmed and added another dimension of complexity.

Dark, malty aroma heavy on roast, with actually a subtle smoked pork aspect, and light tones of cocoa.  Flavor is not as bitter as expected, no dark chocolate / coffee tones, but more roasted stew, wow, they could have classified this as a smoke beer and had me fooled.  It is interesting that the malts theyve used have produced this without smoked malt.  Dont get me wrong, its not incredibly smoky / ashy, and what Im describing isnt too pronounced, but there is kind of the roasted meat / corn / stew aspect that alot of smoke beers have.  As there warms there is indeed more of a bitterness, however subtle, on the finish.  Overall a nice schwarzbier, its medium bodied, smooth, and easy drinking.

A: poured into a snifter. the beer pours an impenetrable black/dark mahogany. No head at all on top, besides a haze of tan swirls. Lack of a head is the reason for the low score.

S: almost smells like a stout. Rich roasted dark malts are the lead, which I pulled coffee, toffee, some figs and raisins as well. A mild hint of chocolate, but very faint.

T: Wow...I now have a total understanding as to why Tomme is the fucking man. This is by far the most amazing schwarzbier I have ever tasted, and probably ever will. Deep and intense roasted dark malts, almost make this taste like a stout or a porter. Chocolate and coffee tones are the major flavors. This is a very sweet/malty version of this style. Some light hints of dark fruits like fig and cherry.

M: carbonation was a little light, but it enhanced the malts in my opinion. The most full bodied schwarzbier ever!

4367,"2010-07-14",3.7,"It is always good to see craft breweries trying their hands at lagers. Well, I should qualify that. It is always good to see a craft brewery who actually has the skill to do it properly try their hand at making a lager and that is just what Port did on this one. The appearance is the only real negative on this one. Its a nice enough garnet black color but the head is sort of foamy and dull gray in color. It doesnt look awful but it also doesnt strike me as particularly great. But, oh, the nose is wonderful! A thick, rich porter or even stout-like roast character dominates. Generally a schwartzbier will have a somewhat porter-like character but this is really up there w/ some greats like Founders porter as far as the rich, roasty aroma. The flavor is not on quite the same level. It might just be a hair thin, which is really only disappointing compared to the nose. The coffee and chocolate richness keeps up reasonable well and any sweetness is well matched w/ a smooth bitterness in the finish. I actually dont know if Id really call this strictly an authentic take on the schwarzbier style as its done in its homeland but an American take and perhaps somewhat better or at least more interesting because of it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

The earthiness is balanced by the caramel malt sweetness and again balanced by the roastiness. Good carbonation. Light and refreshing. Crisp and clean.

4367,"2009-02-23",3.8,"Black with faint prune highlights showing through. Creamy, semi-rocky beige foam. Complex malt aromatics of licorice, coffee, chocolate fudge, burnt toffee, and seared malt hulls. Hints of vanilla taffy (yeast), burnt popcorn and a vibrant whiff of black plums and pen ink. Moderately soft carbonation. Bottle conditioned. Subdued estery plum and black licorice twang gives way to an airy surge of roast chased by a moist kiss of bittersweet chocolate and creamed caramel. Malts are seductively dense, fluffy, and clean, yet gradually take on more complexity and contrasting snappiness more akin to charcoal and coffee grounds. Crisp yeast appropriately teases the palate but soon finds itself pinned beneath the semi-clingy residuals and fruity esters. Hops impart a dab of oiliness to the well-attenuated body. Finishes dryly roasty with nutty java, seared malt hulls and a muted metallic zing. Slightly weighty residual sugars of molasses and chocolate fudge linger well into the aftertaste. Might be a bit heavy on the char, which somewhat hinders the drinkability, as it drinks more like a stout than a lager. Seriously flavorful considering its modest strength. Gotta love that they went the extra distance to bottle condition this and leave it unfiltered. The world certainly needs more beers like this.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

4367,"2009-02-21",3.1,"Im actually rating this against the style of American Dark Lager, I dont think that it is a schwartzbier.  Just because its a really dark lager doesnt mean its a schwartzbier.
Aroma- Burnt roastiness, smells like a campfire.  I even got the impression of smoked meat.
Appearance- Murky, Dark Chocolate color, no clarity... perhaps due to the bottle conditioning.  Very little dark tan head is appropriate for style.
Taste- No sweetness and no esters, both qualities are appropriate for style.  Roasty, burnt flavors dominate, BJCP says that this is a defect for the style, but I kind of like it.  Low sorness, moderate hop bitterness.  Low hop flavor.
Palate is light in body, heavy on the carbonation.  There is a very little astringency.  It works for the style.
Overall impression- I enjoyed this beer because you dont see too many dark american lagers.  If you made this with ale yeast instead of lager, it would be an awesome stout.  The roastiness is a bit out of place, but it works for me because it is different.  It tastes like they just heaped the roasted malt in the beer.  For the price, its worth checking out.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Dmalone102"

4367,"2009-01-24",4.0,"22. Thanks, Hogfodder! Pours jet black, with a dense, creamy, but short-lived burnt tan head. Enormous astringent coffee nose. Starts to dawn on you right away that this is intended to be an imperial stout with lager yeast, but dialed back enough on the grain bill that its not a baltic porter, either. They just want to keep it light and drinkable but still smack you around with that much aroma and flavor. have to say they succeed. The name really start to make sense that way, too--surfing at night is a lot more energetic than most of the stuff we do by moonlight, so a dense, syrupy beer would feel metaphorically way out of place. Ever since reading about the risks and highs of moonlight surfing in The New Yorker in 92, its always something that sounded really interesting--so I totally buy that these guys have done it, or know someone who has. Anyway, back to the beer. The bodys clean and drinkable, firmly carbed, not quite fizzy or prickly but bold enough for sure. Theres roast and coffee and maybe a hint of dark baking chocolate on the mid-palate. Long dry coffee finish. Great, very drinkable black lager.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

4367,"2008-11-20",3.9,"Bottle courtesy of floydster poured into a tulip.

The pour is very dark and settles in almost completely black in the glass with hints of mahogany when held up to light. A decent cream colored head hangs around for a while and leaves a solid ring and very good lacing.

The aroma is big on heavily roasted malts and bits of smoke. There is definitely some coffee and dark chocolate in the background, but the toasted character is dominant.

The taste follows the aroma with a slightly sweeter caramel sweetness. The toasted character is present along with some coffee which gives way to a slight smokiness in the finish.

The mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied for the style with good carbonation and a fairly dry, smoky finish.

4367,"2008-06-04",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2008 In short: A Swarzbier convincingly disguised as a very roasted chocolaty stout.  Very very good
How: Bottle, freshly release first batch of this new beer.  Shared on the Stone-Bourbon-Barrel-RIS-Hype-And-Disappointment tasting session with Montreal crew
The look: Black body with a very short-lived tan head
In long: Nose of a big roasted chocolaty American stout.  Full body beer with a creamy mouthfeel.  Chocolate upfront with a mix of black chocolate and milk chocolate.  Roastiness level would be high by stouts standards so by Swarzbier standards this is over-the-top roastiness.  Some fruity notes limited to raisins and some light vinous notes.  A little floury too.  With all the roastiness and all those chocolate malts I would have never guess that this was a lager yeast beer, even less a Swarzbier.  Someone at Port Brewing decided this is a Swarzbier, ok, no problem, when you rule the business you can redefine the standards as much as you want, Microsoft has been doing that for years.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4367,"2008-06-03",3.6,"Objectively speaking:
A very bold schwarzbier that feels like a stout

I like:
Highly aromatic. Fine coffee flavours. Highly roasty and confident. This is a racy one: fruity and rather complex. 

I dislike:
Timid lager character, Id have mistaken it for a stout. Rather rich-bodied and certainly not very refreshing, but just a very tasty black beer  nothing really all that sessionable.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
4367,"2008-06-02",4.0,"Appearance: Pours a black, opaque body capped by a frothy, bubbly, khaki-colored head.

Smell: Aroma of dark malts, roasted licorice root, dark caramel, and fruit. Waft of pipe smoke, too!

Taste: Dark, roasty maltiness with a very restrained sweetness. Tastes of licorice and caramel. Splash of mineral water. Roasty bitterness. Slight tart fruitiness underneath all the heavily burnt malts. Smooth, smokey finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. Medium carboantion.

Drinkability: Geez Louise, this things more roasty than some stouts, yet it still retains a pleasingly crisp body. Good stuff!","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

4367,"2008-05-26",4.0,"My bottle (22oz) shared at Rudolfs May 2008 Tasting. Pours black with an average size diminishing tan head. Aromas smoky along with roasted malt, grain, some chocolate and light hops. Flavour of a roasted Lager with some smoke, herbal hops and notes of chocolate. Nice long bitter finish. Medium bodied. Great stuff -- these guys always deliver.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","blankboy"
4367,"2008-05-26",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
Molasses and raisins flow in this stout Schwarzbiers veins, surrounded by muscular chocolate and agile roastiness, conjuring up a lusciously nourishing and drinkable example of the style.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the brown-sleeved black.
-There is a lot of body for a beer this size; this feature tends to differentiate it from most German-brewed schwarzbiers Ive had.
-Some coffee character is perceived as well.
-All flavors coalesce and present themselves as a single, complex entity.
-The finish is relatively crisp and nicely bitter, which was not necessarily predicted by the sweet nose.

4367,"2008-05-12",3.7,"Pours a dark brown/black with a moderate, dissipating tan head.  Aroma, at first anyway, is incredibly close to the Serpents Stout, but eventually gives way to other things.  Strong roast, coffee and licorice elements at first, followed by nuts, toasted pumperknickel and maybe rye-like grain, similar to an O-fest.  Tastes of similar elements as well with a big dark burnt toast, dark chocolate and strong coffee flavor, but all mellowed out to a a real drinkable level.  Finishes with roasty espresso flavor and strong dark bitterness.  Its interesting to taste potent imperial stout style flavors in something thats so easy to drink.  Palate is medium bodied medium carbonated, and I would call it thin cause its so drinkable, but its far from thin-bodied.  I never thought Id say this about a schwarzbier, but this is pretty f*cking hardcore!

Warming layers of spring fruits blossom toward the end with a  lovely, rounding influence.  Crisp, dark malt flavor only lightly tinted with soap astringency; mostly dominant are flavors of pleasantly creamed coffee and soft sugars.  Sweetness of red apple and blood orange and cinnamon; plenty of lactose lining the mid palate with tangy and tart sugars.  Light bodied and mildly sharp throughout; ashen pulse of coffee grounds and grey sweetness in the long finish.  Plenty of prickly shwarz character throughout, but bolstered by an unexpectedly soft, simmering complexity uncommon in this type of simple dark offering, porter, stout or otherwise.

Clean malt aromas of chocolate, malted milk balls and gently toasted nuts, along with some hints of roast bitterness.  Clean, straightforward malty nose, just as it should be.  Medium light bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel with a smooth, creamy texture.  Not overly light, but certainly easy drinking.  A hefty amount of black patent-like roast is present, bold, but bitterness is restrained.  Lots of cocoa and lightly roasted coffee with some nuttiness toward the back end.  No yeast characters noticeable, which is good.  A mild to moderate herbal hop bitterness comes in on the back end, complimenting the dark malt characters nicely.  Not really a schwarzbier in anything besides color or the fact that its a lager, but unless thats what youre looking for, dont let that deter you.  This is much more flavorful and enjoyable than most schwarzbiers Ive had.  Certainly a good beer overall, but my only criticism comes in the name.

Nose has some heavy amounts of roasted barley and chocolate malt, with a similar flavor: roasty, charred, dry malt, toasted bread, charred wood, cracked cereal grains, and a bit of a twangy quality as well, maybe from the yeast or the lagering?  It definitely comes off like a stout, but has some small amount of character thats unlike stout, but I certainly wouldnt pen this as a schwarzbier.

4367,"2008-04-18",4.0,"22oz bottle courtesy of Joey at South Bay.  The pour is black and glossy with a creamy ring of dark tan cream.  If I didnt know any better, I would think this was a stout.  The aroma is roasty and chocolaty, much the way a porter would be.  So far I cant find the lager in this.  
After the first big mouthful it becomes a bit more apparent.  There is a ton of flavor here, but it comes across as more European and less American in character.  Im not finding any hops, but Im finding some smokey/roasty/chocolaty notes that are really very appealing.  The smoke is very well blended and it isnt astringent, but it is earthy and strong.  The body is more refreshing than heavy.  At 5% this is definitely a sessionable beer and that would be a wonderful session.  Great work on an under-represented style.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","shadey"

4367,"2008-04-05",3.9,"A vigorous pour produces an almost three-finger thick, well browned, tan colored crown of froth.  The beer is an opaque, solid black color that allows no light to come through even when held up directly to the light.  Hugely roasted aromatics dominate the nose of this brew; a mix of toasted malt, light espresso (deeply roasted coffee and some light burnt acidity), roasted saltine crackers, toasted whole grain bread.  While the roast character is huge in the aroma, it never gets out of control or harsh, and the cracker / bread malt notes are just so inviting and appetizing.  A big part of this whole grain cracker character probably comes from the fact that this is from the second runnings of Serpent Stout; it doesnt get astringent in the aroma though.

Smooth tasting and almost devoid of sweetness, large roast character, but a very light beer until you get to the long finish where the malt character sticks to the palate.  This beer is most definitely defined by the massive roast character; this tastes burnt, with notes of French Roast coffee, blackened malt, deeply toasted whole-grain crackers & rustic bread, and overly caramelized / blackened maltose all without taking on the strong harshness that so much roast grain could cause (obviously Tomme cares about his mash PH).  The burnt acidity here is quite restrained and adds just enough for a nice balancing effect and the sharp, astringent, burnt grain husk character is almost non-existent.

As the beer warms up a bit the malt character picks up a bit of richness, roundness and adds more texture to the body of this brew.  It is of course still quite quaffable, but the residual grain sugars start to have a little more influence without adding much sweetness to this brew.  The roast character is just too big for any sweetness to come into play.  The second pour injects some more carbonation which accents a burnt acidity, so I definitely prefer this with a slight carbonation (luckily a few quick swirls of my glass get this to the right level).

A really nice beer, I am definitely enjoying that this beer does not have any overly harsh flavors, especially since it has such a huge roast character & is the second runnings of a mash.  Somehow instead of creating astringent grain husk notes, the fact that this is from the second runnings of Serpents Stout, has given this brew a really interesting, whole grain, cracker character (both in the nose and in the flavor).  A superb beer that I cant wait to get more of next year.  I could wish that this became a regular part of their line up, but I think that the character would change quite a bit if it did not come from the second runnings, but maybe it would get better.  Speaking of which, Serpents Stout is going to have a hard time being more enjoyable than this.

roasted coffee bean and leather forward. In its wake follow a bit of steak and herb. The malt

4367,"2008-02-10",3.4,"This beer is made from the second sparge of the mashed grains from Serpents stout.
