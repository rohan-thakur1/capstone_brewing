Pours of amazing, unusual bronze color, perfectly clear.
Aroma is intense and quite unusual for barleywine, with a distinct smoked whiskey character, then following by wood & dark syrup tones, excellent.
Taste is epic, having incredibly low carb level, it is so rich and complex, overwhelmingly malty sweet upfront, then sweet like a candy, mixed with notes of iodine, oak, vanilla, a bit ashy and spirity.

Taste has a lots of smoked peat, oily nuts, beach wood, sweet brownies, smoked salmon, bacon, smoked pork, caramel.  Alcohol is somewhat apparent but I would not have guessed 13%.
