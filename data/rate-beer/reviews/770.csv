Tickers will rate any garbage imperial stout or dog shit wild ale from a no-name brewery above basically any existing beer in these classic German styles. That aint right. Its just dumb.

This draft is a hazy amber color with a large and lacy light khaki head. Great aroma- caramel, nuts, banana phenols, clove. Flavor is medium sweet, decently complex.

Taste: Sweetish taste of caramel glazed toasted, thick-cut wheat bread topped with a bit of banana. Slight tanginess from the wheat malt. Modest clove-like spice accent. Very lightly bitter with no more than a gentle touch of hops. Drying, neutral finish as the flavors just drop off, scrubbed away by the active suds.

770,"2011-10-22",3.3,"Tap at Monks Table. Deep brown cloudy pour topped by a thick, pillowy head. The aroma has the requisite clove (although the banana is fairly muted) and lots of wheaty character. Just a touch of toasted dark malt that adds a bit of complexity. Medium-bodied but highly carbonated that lends quite a bite to the brew.  A little touch of white pepper on the back of the palate as well. Lightly sweet with a bit of lingering malt on the finish. Its decent although Id prefer to see the dark malt a bit more expressive in the beer.

Pour brings a somewhat-muddy light caramel brew that isnt terribly hazy. Off-white head with a bit of lacing and not too much retention. The nose brings some light dark malts and even a hint of chocolate along with clove and a bit of banana. The taste doesnt offer too much more and is a bit plain--its almost as if the malt was to be the focus in this beer rather than the yeast. Mouthfeel is fairly light with a touch of carbonation.

Mildly carbonated for the style which is something I can definitely appreciate. I like the mildness of this one, not anywhere near as obnoxioiusly spicy as Paulaner Dunkelweisse, though it does remind me of it.

Flavor is grainier than expected, with some light fruity esters, a bit of spice, and lots of toasted malts. Palate is medium, semi-sweet, lightly spiced, and slightly watery with some slightly sharp carbonation. Pretty well balanced, but the sharpness throws everything a bit off for me.","Hawthorne, New Jersey, USA","jblendy"

Poured a cloudy orange hued caramel brown. Active carbonation in the beginning leads to a large creamy, tight foamy head. Takes awhile to dissipate, a smattering of laced sticking.

A nose of bubble gum and banana, fruity esters, lightly sweet toasted malts, touches of caramel and grainy bread. A light herbal hop at the edges.

Smooth medium body, creamy malty crispness, well rounded feel in the palate. Subtle clove, nuts and banana, good weizen yeast flavors. Toasted grain bready malts, a mild fruitiness in the middle, traces of lemons. Soft herbal, tea leaf hops that finish with a dry spiciness.

770,"2004-07-08",3.5,"Hazy, copper body with a thick, tan head.  Interesting spicy, wheat nose with cinnamon, clove, banana, a touch of both chocolate and banana.  The yeast is present, but seems to be more sour than fruity.  The body is exactly what I expected:  thicker than the typical hefeweizen, but not too thick, and not sticky or harsh.  The flavor is reminiscent of the aroma, but with subdued spice and more rounded sweetness.  The wheaty, grainy malt comes through here more so than in the nose.  The finish carries a unique sour element that keeps this from being too one-dimensional.  A more rounded flavor set and a touch more fruitiness would make this world class.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

Beer looks watery and is watery but doesnt taste watered down. It simply isnt very cloudy...something I personally like in a wheat beer. On the tounge, it dissipates and is as carbonated as other wheats. Tastes very fruity. Catching hints of apricot and raisin...but really carbonated ones. Aftertaste is dry and refreshing. Good brew. better on tap than in the bottle in my opinion...a rarity from my mouth.

770,"2002-11-07",3.8,"Sweet beautiful aroma. Fruits and yeats mesh together perfectly. At times this gets a little weak kind of like extra watery spots. Perfect carbonation as Ive found previous wheats to be over carbonated. There is SOMETHING missing (ill be damned if i can finger it), but this is still a great wheat. Love the sweetness. Came in a pint sized bottle...extra brownie points.","Florida, USA","TheRimmer"

Besides the wheat, the overwhelming flavour and aroma was apple.  If I wanted that I would of had apple juice.  To top it all off, this beer was way too carbonated.  To end on a positive note, it did have a decent hop backbone and was appropriately malted.","Pullman, Washington, USA","Merc"

770,"2002-05-30",3.4,"Its funny that this and the Franziskaner Dunkel Weisse are only separated by 0.01 as I drank the 2 side by side and could find very little different. Most noticeably the Hacker is lighter in palate and not as complex. Theres a mild sour fruitiness at first that makes me think of banana milkshake, but then it turns drier in the latter half, much quicker than the Franz version did, certainly more coffeish while theres also a touch of hop bitterness in the finish.","California, USA","BeerLimey"

770,"2002-04-01",3.4,"Huge, creamy white head, which grew enormously, even by weisse standards.  The color, resembling ice tea, is a bit lighter than I expected.  The aroma is mostly banana and grain...so I guess its like a nice loaf of banana bread.  Light to moderate carbonation, and the mouthfeel is a bit watered down.  The malts are nice and smooth, but it needs a bit more bite.  More clove/spice would be ideal.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
770,"2002-03-29",4.2,"This is a 5.5% alcohol by volume dark wheat beer that pours with a cloudy, brown color very similar in appearance to a strongly brewed iced-tea. This beer is not labeled as a Hefe Weisse, which means that active yeasts were not added to the bottle for additional bottle fermentation and aging (Hefe is the German word for yeast, Weiß is the color white, as most wheat beers are light in color). When poured, this beer will produce a huge, creamy off-white colored head that settles very slowly in the glass, so you will want to be sure to pour slowly and gently. 

In the nose, this beer present the classic dark wheat beer aromas of cloves, some banana fruit, and yeast. It is a pleasant smell, something lighter than a freshly baked loaf of banana bread.","Pico Rivera, California, USA","maxhits"

Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, velvety/creamy texture, lively carbonation.
