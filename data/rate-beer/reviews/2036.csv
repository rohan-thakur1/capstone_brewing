2036,"2017-05-30",3.4,"On tap @ the Gingerman. This is a slightly cloudy looking one, reddish amber in the color and a small sidesticking head on the sides. Smells like a Jolly creation. Slightly wood tart, dryish yet berry fruity. Some white sugar hints. Mild but still quite nice. Thin and almost a little watery in the mouth while its soft on the prickling bubbles. Lots of tart wood in here. Red lingon berries, some salt. Theres a little bit of plum wine in this also. Decent and typically Jolly flavors, but a bit too anonymous to make it really interesting. 09.06.2015","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Looks great. Dark cherry skin nose, with some developed funk and depth. Fairly sweet on nose too. Body is delicious and subtle, done with a great hand.

Flavour is tart but not heavily sour, grapes, light notes of cherry and tart cranberry, a touch of citrus, some slightly sweet caramel malt notes, increasing dryness from the oak, leather, a bit of earth, maybe some bittering hops, persistent tart grape, a little soap/solvent thing on the back end which is distracting. Lightly spicy Brett. Very dry, slightly bitter and tannic aftertaste Light to medium bodied with almost no carb. As the label says, feels like a Flanders red as much as a Biere de Garde, definitely on the sour side for the latter.

OCZY : piwo jest przejrzyste o kolorze jasnym z odcieniami brązu i brudnej pomarańczy. Piana mala i byle jaka. Kolor brudnej bieli. Ogólnie piwo jest brzydkie ale za to przejrzyste. 

NOS : piana szybko opadła i trudno ja z powrotem wzburzyć co nie pomaga wydobyć intensywne aromaty. Wyczuwam lekka tarte i susz owocowy o nutach jabłka, gruszki i delikatnie wygotowanych wiśni. W zapachu jest również drewno i delikatnie gozdzki. Do tego czarna porzeczka. 

USTA : piwo jest wodniste o niskim nasyceniu o drobnych bąbelkach. Całkiem przyjemne w ustach i bardzo łatwe w piciu. 
Smak piwa nie jest super intensywny ale świetnie ułożony. Cechuje to piwo delikatna i przyjemna kwaśność i cierpkość o nutach zielonego jabłka i drewna. Główne nuty to tarta i gotowane wyżej wymienione owoce. Alkohol jest całkowicie ukryty i ma się wrażenie pić delikatnie sfermentowany kompot z suszu. Chmiele nie graja wielkiej roli w tym piwie, dodają ziołowych niuansów. Posmak jest długi ale delikatny o nutach owocowych i cierpkich. 

ODCZUCIA : pomimo, że piwo nie jest uber intensywne (na co cena tego piwa sugeruje) ale nie mogę się przyczepić do super pijalności i przyjemności z subtelności tego piwa. Profil kwaskowaty jest pod mój gust. Ja lubię.

It's earthy with a tinge of sourness. Honestly, I could have taken even more sourness in this. The oak comes through big time, working very well in the beginning and middle of the taste, but getting a little overbearing in the finish. That combined with a baking soda like bitterness in the finish downgrades this a bit for me. Still good.","","Beardaxe"

The taste was mainly sour and tart with a nice side dose of the cherries to amplify the the sourness.

2036,"2013-09-17",4.4,"Blend 2 Bottled 2/24/10
Tasted on 9/17/13 from a capped 750mL bottle that has been in the cellar for quite some time. Pours dark, opaque, mahogany with an average white head that slowly recedes to average lace. The nose is very tart with tons of lemon acidity, white wine vinegar, a touch of burnt rubber funk, and just a light hint of the caramel malt that is obviously providing the darkness of this beer. The flavor is extremely sour and tart with tons of lemon, wine vinegar (very vinous), a nice touch of vanilla oak, and a very nice caramel malt underlying. The body is medium with a woody, tannic texture, lively carbonation, and a long, super sour and vinous finish. This beer with age is otherworldly.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"

2036,"2013-08-01",4.2,"Blend 1, bottled 2/2013. Complex and hard to define.. though a very enjoyable sour. Subtle vinous aromas and flavors consisting of subtle dark cherries and damp wood, though unlike a Flanders sour. More subtle, undefinable nuances.. Maybe some cranberry, strawberry and other berry flavors.. A deep earthy, yeast component is also present, though very much in check and balanced with other layers. A very enjoyable sour, that I think may be under-appreciated in my neck of the woods, as it sells slowly. Definitely now one of my favorite JP's.

The beer is orange to brown in color, with an off white head. Random, spotty lacing on the tulip. Awesome aroma, with a strong Brettanomyces presence. Funky, wild, and wonderful. The flavor is outstanding. Easy to drink and quite enjoyable. Medium to thin in body, with adequate carbonation. I am thoroughly enjoying this. Perhaps not as bold or daring as the Grand Reserve, but highly quaffable. I definitely recommend it and would have it again.

2036,"2012-03-13",4.1,"From notes.  First reviewed 11/19/2011.  Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip.

Biere de Mars pours a hazy apple cider bronze color with a medium tan head that eventually fades to a ring around the edge of the glass. No real lacing to speak of.

The aroma is mostly sour, with a soft leather and musty funk. Caramel malt and dried dark fruits, mostly cherries, control the aroma with an oak back.

A soft caramel sweetness starts out before the lactic sourness takes over. Cherry plum notes remind me of an Oude Bruin. Some oak, vanilla, and spice come in toward the middle of the sip, with some lemon zest and general tartness to finish it off. 

The body of Biere de Mars is a little bit fuller than I expect from a sour. The oak dries out and lightens the back end, but the body is still on the full side. The feel is sour, mostly lactic, that causes some salivation. The carbonation is on the light side and fades over the course of the glass.

Pours a very dark ruby/chestnut brown color that appears completely opaque in the glass with sligh mahogany edges and a two finger frothy beige head. Very good retention, slowly fading into a lasting cap that leaves chunks of soapy lacing behind.

Funky earthy aroma with a prominent barrel character as well as some bret, citrus fruit and zesty spice. Lots of earthy oak/wood as well as some coriander and citrus rind.

Full chewy body with a slightly creamy texture as well as some soft carbonation up front and a good bit of dry funk. Slightly tart without being acidic. Nice dry Bret presence along with a wrong barrel character and malt backbone. Hints of earhy oak, dry Bret and other bugs,vanilla and citrus peel. Dry finish.

This one has that typical Jolly Pumpkin feel to it that all of their beers seem to share.  Beyond that, it was just alright.

2036,"2009-09-09",4.5,"750ml bottle with a very cool label depicting the wind blowing a ship around. This beer was an opaque red color with a thin white head resting across the top. The smell was really good and made me think of fruit, especially cherries. The taste was cherries, tart, sour, but not overpowering.Im not sure I tasted the oak. I especially liked the mouthfeel as the carbonation seemed bubbly and perfect for this beer. This beer just got better and better as it warmed. I have been consistently impressed by the Jolly Pumpkin beers and I am glad they came to Colorado. This beer was excellent and worth the price of admission.

05/10/08 batch 256

I was a little disappointed that the price went up to $14.99 but since this is my favorite JP beer I caved. This was every bit as good as I remembered from last year. Tart smell, nice sour cherry flavor, some oak this time, the sourness is perfect. This is so easy to drink and a wonderful beer. Still my favorite from JP.

01/25/09 2007 bottle thanks to moejuck

Smells acidic like tomatos or ketchup, slight bit of oak and funk, smells really good. Tart but not sour, very easy to drink, subtle flavors, might be better fresh but it holds up well after 20 months or so.

A few sips in the tartness smooths out revealing some cherry, almond, cinnamon and toffee.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"

2036,"2008-08-31",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2012 750ml bottle, batch 256.  Purple brown colored body, mostly clear but still has little light penetration.  Nose is wondrous... there considerable dried fruit in the nose and flavor: dates, raisins, apricots, black cherries... its nutty and pitty and woody throughout... theres a mild acidity (resembles oud bruin) and a light lactic tartness as well, and the dryness of the oak is easily evident.  Rich and tangy tobacco and dried apricots, turns more towards prickly yeast and oak on the back.  The recent batch of the grand reserve remains one of the best beers Ive ever had, and this batch of regular Biere de Mars is also amazing, no surprise.  Seems like its something with cellar potential as long as it doesnt get to lactic.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
2036,"2008-08-17",4.1,"Bottle, batch 256, courtesy of mcbackus. First off, this has to be one of the most gorgeous beers to look at. I must have spent ten minutes holding my snifter up to the sun admiring the ruby red, clear brown color with a thick foamy off white head.  Aroma is a funky mix of earth, wood & fruit. Palate is a sour tartness with lively carbonation. At first I was put off by the sour flavor, but after a while it grows on you. We got flavors of green apples, cherrys, oranges, lemons, vanilla bean, all with an woody flavor in the background.  Thank you Matt, looking forward to more Jolly Pumpkin brews.","Wilton, New Hampshire, USA","mcox90"

Taste is also a typical JP mix between some orange, lightly sweet lemon with some distinctive barnyard and bretty notes. I think I detect some spices but there are not too prominent and might come from the yeast used in this beer. Full body with good carbonation and no distinctive alcohol.

The taste is barnyard brett, oak, subtle fruitiness (lemon) and some light roast, with a fairly bracing sourness present. It seems like the barrel character, with all the funky bugs that reside in said barrel, really dominates every aspect of the beer.

2036,"2008-05-31",3.8,"Another eagerly anticipated Jolly Pumpkin offering.  To all appearances it is a clone of their Roja; it has the same color head and body, save for a slightly thinner head.  The aroma too is duplicated, with a few tweaks and modifications.  Contrasted to the Roja, the Biere de Mars sustains a stronger suite of banana, vinegar and a pinching wood scent.  Throw in some dry pretzel dough and a handful of decadent Ghiradelli chocolate chips and youre in for a vaporous world of wonder.  As an after thought I might have found some cotton candy, but I cant confirm whether it is a real scent or my head is swimming from the earlier intake of Biere de Mars wonderful perfume.  The flavor is certainly less delicate, causing me to clench my teeth with its eye-watering sourness.  Heavy doses of spices hit the tongue, mostly All-Spice and cinnamon.  After these two clear out the tongue is victim to a long and dessicated hoppiness.  Another splash on the tongue, though, and were back to a world of sour hurt.  A lovely beer, especially to smell, but not for the faint of heart.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

2036,"2008-05-13",4.0,"Batch 256.  Not a gusher like most of JPs beers!  Pours a hazy, dark mahogany color with an average, off-white, creamy, pillowy head;  it settles after good retention to a small, pillowy, frothy layer and leaves minimal tight lace.  Nose is certainly JP-esque with some sourish notes; certainly some sweet grain notes and rich caramel make up the malt base with some overtones of overripe cherries, sour vinous white grapes, and and almost pickled note bring the tart citric notes.  Other notes include, white pepper, sage, ginger root, anise, doughy and lightly musty yeast, and faint vanilla oak notes.  Flavor is similar but is rather quick to disappate from the tongue and not as complex.  Flavor starts mildly tart with overripe cherries, vinous white grapes, and light sour apple, then some caramels, sweet grains, and musty yeast filter in, and towards the finish lighter notes of sage, ginger, faint buttery notes and faint white pepper find their way in to the mix.  Palate is nice for the style with a perfect medium body, nearly lively carbonation, and a silky feel with a quick drying feel as it progresses. Finishes fairly quickly with the tart notes fading to just a light overripe cherry note and a dry oak and sage note finish it all.  Certainly a very drinkable, somewhat refreshing, and quite complex beer.  The more I had, the more I seemed to like it.  Biere de Mars seemes to be one of those styles that  takes the malty, aged qualities of the Biere de Garde and adds some tart, refreshing qualities making it a beer you want to drink more and more.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

2036,"2008-04-02",3.7,"Second in our Jolly Pumpkin diptych, I was surprised to find a striking similarity between La Roja and Bière de Mars. Suggesting the weathered planks of a ship, the body glows of a deep orange under a brumous cream-colored head. The nose is what veritably likens the two beers. The matching funkiness implies a strong influence from the barrels that may be masking their individuality. Still, I found the Bière de Mars less tight, showing more banana and green apple, as well as nutmeg, allspice and brown sugar. The mouthfeel is dry and aggressively carbonated, which sadly erodes some of the flavor. Red apple, blueberries and a leathery sourness are welcome tonalities, however. I preferred La Roja for its kinder texture and affable mascot. (20/05/07)","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"
2036,"2008-04-01",3.0,"Clear amber in colour. Medium to low carbonation, which is really odd for a Jolly Pumpkin beer based on my experience. Aromas are of lightly toasted malt, funky fruit, and a bit of wood. Moderately tart in the mouth, with some lemon and sour green apple notes. Very faint malt and caramel notes are apparent as well. A hint of wood comes through on the end. The mouthfeel is slick due to the lower than expected carbonation, which I think might be unintentional. Not to bad overall, but is somewhat in an awkward ""in between"" style place for me.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"

Im probably shorting it by not giving it a 9, but for some reason I cant quite go there. Flavor brings a ton of oak into play that I really couldnt get in the aroma, along with the wonderful sour fruits and yeasts that were present in the nose. Medium bodied, lively carbonation. Very refreshing, even when we were freezing our asses off. Finishes crisp and bitter, also with a nice sour note to round things out. Wonderful beer,  criminally underrated I think.","Tampa, Florida, USA","Quake1028"
2036,"2007-11-16",3.4,"750 ml bottle. Poured a slightly hazy dark orange color. Head was tall, rocky, and off white with good retention. Aroma was of sour fruit with a hint of oak. Very tart and effervescent on the tongue. The acidity tapers off somewhat but lingers a while. Tasted of oak and sour fruits with toasted bread and graham cracker in the background. I was initially disappointed, but the beer improved as it warmed a bit and was given a chance to breathe.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"

2036,"2007-10-28",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2008 Rerate.  I didnt realize I had rated this one.  750mL bottle, no date.  Clear orange brown with a creamy two finger yellowish white head, great retention--I dont know how it could look better.  Nose has plenty of caramel and funky brett with some dry oakiness in the background.  Digging a little further the fruitiness (didnt I mention fruitiness?) presents itself as white grapes and tart cherries.  Flavor continues with not a ton of acidity, but enough to keep the caramel sweetness at bay (ha! I said the same damn thing in my old rating).  There is also kind of a buttery caramel note--much like I get in New Glarus Unplugged Belgian Quadruple.  Dry low to moderately bitter (3 out of 10) lingering earthy finish.  Once this got to room temperature there the alcohol was just noticeable.  Moderate carbonation--lightly tingly yet also creamy--with a medium body.  I very much enjoyed this.  7-5-8-4-15--3.9  Old rating.  Cant remember if I bought or traded for this.  750mL, no date.  Hazy orange with hints of brown and a 2 1/2 finger light beige head, very nice retention--glad this didnt asplode when I opened it, which Ive had the pleasure of dealing with a few times with JP.  Aroma of sour apple flesh, dry oak, a fair amount of barnyard funk, leathery brett, and a wonderful bready sweetness that helps keep the sourness at bay.  Flavor adds a fitting buttery note to the brett that fits very well.  This doesnt seem to be as tart or sour as JPs other offerings, and thats fine with me.  Still some tart apple notes, plenty of dry oak, light spices and alcohol are the only other notable additions.  Fairly fruity with minimal bitterness and some earthy elements.  Moderate carbonation with a medium body.  Very good beer.  Ah, yes--I picked this up at the Blue Maxx during the RBSG.  8-5-8-4-16--4.1  The average of the two is a 4.0, which Ill change in the overall.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
2036,"2007-10-16",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 17, 2007 Trade from jasonmech77.  Deep amber beer with a light haziness.  Aroma is just incredible, earthy funkiness with a soft leathery dustiness.  There is a surprisingly prominent red grape sweetness.  Much less of the lemony citrus that I normally asociate with Jolly Pumpkin, but still maintaining a distinct house character.  The acidity is quite restrained here, letting the soft earthy malts come through.  Definitely more balanced than other JP beers.  Softly bready but also insistently fruity.  Red wine with soft spiciness on the back.  Really nice beer.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

2036,"2007-09-10",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
That intrinsic Jolly Pumpkin wooden barrel character brings along its usual wild citrusy twang to broaden the fruity yeast signature and caramel malt apport. Brett is admirably balanced even in the finish as its dry, piney spontaneity splashes the back of the tongue.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A bubbly sheet of foam covers the cloudy orange.
-The carbonation is lively and frothy, definitely of Belgian lineage.
-I dont feel like this ones as cohesive in its flavor deployment as Luciernaga or Bam Biere (for example), but I cant really complain with such quality and originality.
-The fruitiness is akin to that of plums, prunes, some fieldberries.

Almost feels like a barleywine. Tastes include fired oak, caramel, subtle yeast, plum, and dark fruit. High carbonation, full body. A great change from the other-more available-beers by this fantastic brewery. Probably one of the coolest beer labels ever printed as well.

______________________________

6/06/2008:  Biere de Mars (French Style Stock Ale) pours a hay amber color with a foamy beige head.  The yeasty aroma has the usual Jolly Pumpkin mustiness along with a prounounced cherry-like presence and hints of vanilla and brown sugar.  The flavor is somewhat dry overall (especially through the finish), but it is nicely balanced and complex.  The recipe for the flavor includes:  caramel maltiness, brown sugar, sour cherry, red wine, a sprinkle of something floral like perfume, some oft oakiness, yeast, a touch of vinegar, toasted bread, and weak char.  The aroma is a bit more sweet than the flavor and the sour/tart/acicic qualities subside and mellow out as the beer warms.  This beer has a medium body and a pretty smooth mouthfeel due to the fine carbonation.  Overall this beer tastes a lot like I would image Fall would taste like if one could capture it in a bottle.  For some reason in conjures images of fallen leaves and roasted acorns in my mind...  Anyways, it is quite good with a refreshing level of tartness balanced by a firm level of maltiness.  Delicious!

A sprinkling of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice follows.  Dried grains are also present.  The flavour is a little maltier at first than Id have suspected, full of dark breads and wild berries, but that quickly fades into the sour cherries and soft funk that was to be expected.  Spices are easily tasted but dont offer unwanted dryness.  Attenuation feels just about right, enough to stand up to the sour/funk with delving into super-dry lambic territory.  Carbonation is very active and tight and theres a gentle oiliness to the mouthfeel.  Worthy of respect, but over shadowed by some of the JP counterparts.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

Tart, woody nose, a hint of cherry...darker tones emerge...very mysterious and intriquing.

Fills the mouth well on first imbibement, tart cherry flavor dominates, sour, then sweet. Floods the mouth, coats the corner with generous flavor, slides out having done its job, unloading unique explosions of taste off the tongue and down the hatch. 

Theres a constant recurrence of the pucker, then the dark oak, then the sweet, as it rounds and quietly depart. Refreshing and drinkable, despite its stronger than average alcohol, (yet moderate, considering current trends).

2036,"2007-06-07",3.4,"Shared bottle at Uber. Hazy amber with big head. Mild sweetness. Actually, pretty mild everything. Light yeast and musty flavor....a good drinker, but not very overwhelming. A little bit of sour fruit. Not what I expected.","Seattle, Washington, USA","glkaiser"
2036,"2007-06-06",3.8,"Pours a deep, cloudy amber with a thick, flat, light tan head. The aroma is sweet with melon, tart fruit, bubble gum, and grass. The flavor starts sweet and malty with some fruit. The middle of the tongue detects a slight amount of acid and some funk (brett?) along with other malt flavors like caramel and toffee. The finish picks up very complex flavors: hints of vanilla, lots of fruit (melon, banana), more grassy brettonamyces funk, and hints of acid that is very mild at first but leaves an after-taste like balsamic vinegar around the teeth and edges of the tongue. The finish is somewhat dry with a fruity malt flavor that intensifies into the after-taste. There are also hints of sherry in the finish and after-taste. The mouthfeel is quite nice - light with a very lively carbonation, but also creamy and not biting. Overall, not much like a typical Bière de Garde - it would be more appropriately labeled an Oud Bruin.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Released 04/07, idealized 05/07.
Moderate pour in a beer mug (its all I had :( 

Poured a clear brown with a huge frothy to rocky fully lasting head with excellent lacing.

Smelt of strong sour brett and citrus, and moderate leather, oak, toasted malt,  spices.

Taste was upfront strong sour brett, orange lemon zest, moderate oak and toasted malt followed by a strong horseblanket sourness and leathery oakiness on a long finish.

Palate was light to medium bodied, lively carbonated, watery on a dry finish, lightly to moderately puckering.

Overall, this one kind of took me by surprise.  I didnt really know what to expect, but the sourness is not over the top and the oak balance is way above par.  There isnt anything to hate in this one.","Midland, MI, Michigan, USA","xav33"
2036,"2007-05-27",2.8,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2014 Bottle (2014 batch). Head is initially small, frothy/fizzy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy medium amber, bottle conditioned.

Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately to heavily acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately to heavily acidic, moderately to heavily bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively/fizzy carbonation, lightly to moderately astringent. Seven years since my last sample, and...yup...alas...its the same as almost everything else JP makes.  Overly attenuated, highly infected/sour, and very generic. They all pretty much smell the same nowadays. What happened to Fantome has unsurprisingly happened to JP; both have so much bacteria going on that everything is sour and a bit dirty. Whether or not Dany and Ron want things to be different, it very well may be out of their control now.

Some musky canteloupe rinds and ripening strawberries add further delights to the tart, lightly fruity bouquet.  Light to medium bodied mouthfeel with a creamy carbonation.  A little on the sweet side for a JP brew, but not cloying, either.  Some gently sour, earthy white grape skins start out the flavors, and then morphs in to a delightfully ashy, musky cheese rind character.

A delicate bouquet of light spice, doughy yeast, soft woodiness, vanilla beans and plums awaits further observation. Flavor to follow is sustained by a brief hoppiness that recedes to reveal a soft and creamy mouthfeel writhing with complexity. Tastes of whimsical fruits and spices, oak, leafy earthiness, honeyed maple and caramel. Another unique perspective from Ron, I can always count on that. Alcohol is deftly cloaked. Medium body, carbonation present is soft and pillowy. Finish is crisp and slightly bitter, not displeasing in any regard. Lovely way to ring in the springtime.

At first, I thought that this beer was inadvertantly infected.   This is mostly because Biere de Garde is not a sour beer style.  Ever.  Okay maybe not 400 years ago, but not nowadays.  Later, someone told me that Jolly Pumpkin puts Brettanomyces in all of their beers.  I guess thats one way to avoid cross contamination.  This beer gets a big thumbs down for being so off base.

This was a very interesting take on the Biere de Garde style.  It has the
   typical hallmarks of a Jolly Pumpkin beer while still staying true to its
   roots.  If you can get your hands on this one, give it a try.  I was lucky
   enough to get my bottle from someone at work.
Aroma / Appearance - Sour cherries, oak, vanilla, plums and cotton
   candy are the primary factors in an interesting nose.  It invites you to
   keep looking for more even though there is not much more depth to be found.
   The cloudy brown body was mildly carbonated with a one finger off-white head
   and sticky lacing which clung stubbornly to the sides of my glass.
Flavor / Palate - This is among the more interesting beers I have had
   a chance to sample.  The typical biere de garde flavors are obvious but along
   with them you get some funk.  Starting from the first sip I picked up sour
   cherries, oak, vanilla, peaches, raspberries and a general fruitiness.  Next
   come a slightly wheaty note combined with caramel and sourness.  The finish
   is both bitter and malty.  Overall I felt that it could have been perhaps
   a little more dense but on the whole it hits all the right notes.  You can
   also tell this is a Jolly Pumpkin produced beer.  Get your hands on a bottle
   if you can.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Plenty of brett in the nose, with some citrus and honey.  Upfront sourness, medium-high acidity, some hints of lemon and vanilla toastiness - but everything seems hidden behind the strong tartness and acidity, falling away to a medium, crisp finish.  I seem to really notice the acidity here, as in the Roja & Oro.  I enjoy the other, less-acidic JP offerings more. 7.4.8.3.16=3.8.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

Nose has that nice Oak Barrel tartness, pleasing malt sweetness, citrus like crispness, and a real portent of the joys to come upon the tasting. Start is semi-sweet, or semi tart, your choice, nice grain presence, top is moderate in feel to the palate.

2036,"2006-05-19",2.5,"Light, clear red-auburn.  Thin, wispy head, barely present.  Nose is wondrously good, great promise here.  Acidic, lightly oaky, just the right kiss of sourness--this is a great, great smelling beer.  The brett is there as well, just a bit of funk, nice balance of the yeast, wood, and sourness, really intriguing.  Regrettably, the flavor cant even vaguely begin to live up to the promise of the nose.  First impression is an overly thin and watery beer, very little carbonation, just does not stick in the mouth at all.  Very lightly tart, bit like concentrated grapefruit.  Some vanilla and oak.

Sweet and tart aromatics  sour malts and dulled grapefruit hops.  Mulled wine and all spice interact with strawberries.  Smooth, almost watery palate, lacking any interesting carbonationbut it works alright with the sour and lip smacking flavours.

2036,"2006-05-12",3.2,"750 ML bottle:  Medium amber w/ no head.  A thin ring forms around the top of the body, but does not have a head.  Seems as though it would be white though.  Oak wood aroma is immediately noticeable as is the Jolly Pumkin yeast twang/brett aroma.  Malt is lightly grainy, but mostly just oak & yeast character.  Lightly toasty & bready as it warms and the yeast becomes a little peppery, but all other aromas are fairly light.  The beer is fairly dry from start to finish.  Very oaky and wood tannin like in the flavor.  Very immediate taste is lightly sweet w/ a light tart fruitiness.  A light cinnamon taste comes around mid palate from somewhere, maybe the yeast.  Aftertaste is dry, oaky, and lightly toasty malt.  Lighter medium body, medium high carbonation, light warming alcohol.  Definitely not my favorite JP beer.  Others have been good up until this point, and its not a bad beer, just a bit 1-2 dimensional IMHO as far as complexity goes.  Could us some aging to mellow out the oak character.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"
2036,"2006-05-12",2.8,"Clear chestnut body with virtually no head.  The nose is really interesting: at first I thought it might be infected, but now Im not so sure.

The body is perhaps a little thin and has virtually no carbonation.  The flavor is kind of sweet up front with the fruity and grainy elements coming through.  Nice subtle caramelization as well.  The finish has a surprisingly strong hop bitterness that I was not expecting.  The spiciness is very subtle in the mouth.  The finish is short to moderate in length and with some noticable alcohol warmth.  This didnt even begin to grab me the way most of the Jolly Pumpkin beers have.

2036,"2006-05-03",4.2,"Bottle. Pours a cloudy red-copper body with a small white bubbly head.

The drinkability is superb and the scores reflect that aspect - lots of juicy fruit flavours that were evident in the aroma and plenty of brett funkiness.

2036,"2006-03-23",4.1,"March 2005 bottle, one year old, consumed on 3/22/06, chilled to start, from a wine glassInitial nose is plummy.  Brett carving the way and lactobacillus in its wake.  Oily, with mature oak notes, dry black cherries, moist prunes and the barest hint of choco-caramel adding faint sweetness on the very end.  I could almost mistake this for an Italian red wine blend were it not for the malt on end.  All this, and I havent even poured the beer yet.  Decanting releases a huge blast of aroma.  Cherries, prunes, cranberries and plenty of yeast.  Lactobacillus emerges very lightly.The body is a deep ruby-mahogany with strong amber-caramel overtones.  A creamy, beige head leaves heavy lacing.  Head is perfectly retained.  Very minute bubbles rise vigorously in the liquid.Warming and breathing allows, finally, for some stronger malt tones to emerge, caramel and vanilla, with the chocolate fading.  Will there be enough there to combat the tannins and wild yeasts?  I cant tell from the aroma.But upon first sip, phew!, a big sigh of relief.  Not only is there enough residual sweetness, but there is just the right amount of it, allowing brisk fruits (apples, cherries, pears) room to maneuver, while still comforting the palate with creamy sweet caramel-toffee notes, reminiscent of Bavaisienne, but with much less fat honey and rich caramel.  Wild yeasts produce tight carbonation, but so much of it, that it comes off overcarbonated for the first 20 minutes or so.  Lactobacillus hangs on the edges lightly, but the brett phenols are still quite notable, adding dry, fruit rind notes and further deepening the complexity.  Thus far, the wood has been only lightly nutty, mildly tannic, but the tannin-build is inevitable, increasing as it warms. Like dry, nutty almonds/almond skins.  Not sure where the cherry (esters?) is coming from, but it is bright and very welcoming, helping to combat the tannins.  However, as I finish the bottle, I would hardly say the tannins are overdone.  Certainly present, but I think this beer escaped their ruinous effect seen in the reserve series and others.  Thanks for the bottle, SuIIy.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2036,"2006-03-13",4.2,"03.11.06  750ml bottle, trade from Schroppfy, shared at HW OH.  Ron has wowed me once again.  This beer was so complex, so elegant, and so enjoyable that I actually sat down and zoned out for a while during the open house, thinking only of the beer.  Of course, as often happens with a great beer experience, I took terrible notes.
Aroma is plumy, sticky, caramel candy, licorice tea.  Long and sticky hop bite is more assertive than expected.  Plum abounds, from the astringent skin, to the tart, slight pith, to the juicy flesh, the dried prune, and the sucked clean stone.  Milk chocolate.  Bean sprouts with sweet and sour.  Tropical fruits.

2036,"2006-03-10",3.9,"750ml bottle thanks to Styles: Pours to a mostly clear dark amber that shines with some ruby-brown hints when held to light.  Though it does becomes hazy further into the bottle.  A large beige colored head forms quickly on top that is bubbly and quickly disapating without much lacing.  The aroma has some distinct dark fruit notes up front: vinous grapes, plums, raisins, light figs, along with hints of sweet caramel and dark bread which really remind me of a belgian dubbel.  Beyond this some mild lemon, tiny bit of hops, as well as some tannic oak barrel, light molasses, caramelized sugar, along with pepper & ginger.  (Believe it or not I didnt read FlacoAltos rating until after I wrote this).  The flavor begins with an ever-so-slightly sour and acidic bite that shows some lemon/citrus notes (maybe even a hint of hops?), then quickly opens to a bit of apple, grapes, a mix of merlot and california sparkling wine, plums, and light raisins.  Theres plenty of spice in the flavor too: cloves, pepper, hops, ginger, and even the oak adds some zest here.  Finishes with some mild tannins, a touch of bitter floral hops, a fleeting hint of figs, and a bit of straw.  Medium bodied, lively carbonated, ends up feeling quick full in the mouth without getting chalky, syrupy, or heavy.  At first I liked it but was not blown away.  However after taking my time drinking and really allowing this one to breathe, this beer reveals itself to be a marvelously complex beer.  I think initially the bitterness from the hops and oak was a bit too much to allow the flavor to develop, but as my palate adjusted (or the beer breathed) the flavors really opened up.  Nice.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"
2036,"2006-02-16",4.2,"Sampled February 2006
Pours a lightly hazy, ruby-hued, dark amber color.  It is pretty well carbonated, which produces a two-finger thick, frothy, lace prone, tan colored head.  The aroma is nice and fruity up front with a mix of raisins, sweet plums, and fresh figs.  The aroma is quite fruit focused actually, underneath this is a solid caramel malt note, which in its brightness only tends to accentuate the fruit aromatics.  Among the fruit notes there is a light tartness as well, but it is fairly subtle.  There is also a bit of spiciness that becomes noticeable after a bit of time; I get notes of bergamot, some clove, and perhaps a little bit of something sharp (sort of a cross between black pepper and ginger).  The aroma is quite nice, though it is perhaps lacking a bit in the complexity department, I really like the straight forward, appealing fruit notes that are rounded out by the other supporting aromatic notes.

The taste has that same rich fruitiness to it.  In fact it almost has a jam-like quality to it, though this beer is certainly not sticky or sweet.  There is just enough sweetness to accentuate the fruitiness, but without anywhere near the levels of sweetness that would make this unappealing (this coming from one who is not a huge fan of sweet fruity beers, even of the more complex variety).  Definitely ample notes of ripened plums play center stage here, it is joined by some raisin-like notes, which at times are even more prevalent than the plum notes.  There is some spiciness here, but mainly that of the sweeter variety; some definite clove, and perhaps some allspice like notes (including a bit of a ginger-like thing).  The finish has a certain astringency to it, I would almost guess that some of it is wood derived, and some of it would most definitely be fermentation derived.

This is quite a rich beer, and I dont mean that in a sort of thick, palate sort of way.  Instead the fruit notes just give this beer a certain richness, that seem to make it an appropriate after meal time drink.  A solid, though light, acidity finishes this beer off at the end of a sip; it is tart like an apple or plum perhaps.  This is really accentuates that feeling, for me, that this would make a good after meal drink.  The acidity almost acts as a digestif for me, it keeps this light enough on the palate to be drinkable, but the rest of the beer keeps this rich enough to be a contemplative after meal treat.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2036,"2006-01-21",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 27, 2006 Finally rating this after several bottles. Cloudy dark orange/almost mahogany. Huge off-white head that eventually fades to film. Great lacing. Shot of sourness up front in the nose, turns to woodsy yeastiness. Cherries and dark fruit are muted, but there, with the tiniest bit of alcohol. Flavor again has a real quick sour kick to it, but turns to sweet malt and dark fruit, mostly fig/prune and faint cherry. lots of woodsy, yeasty, farmhouse character in the finish. Although I dont get alot of spice in the flavor, the lingering aftertaste is dominated by the spice. Another fine creation from Ron! Second batch released Sat.March 25th. Picked up a case today. Very transparent dark amber, reddish-brown color. Off white head very minimal, fades extremely fast, might need a little more time in the bottle to fully carbonate. Previous despription fits aroma very well, oak, funk and cherry, maybe not as sour as I remember. Strange because seems like all the batches have been growing in sourness. Flavor not as diverse as I remember. Sour up front, fades in and out, harsh oak/wood character, sort of drying. Tad thinner on the palate than I remember. New score would most likely be a 3.9, knocking everything except aroma down a point. Have 1 bottle left from last year may have to do a side by side.","Lincoln Park, Michigan, USA","Styles"

2036,"2005-12-19",3.9,"Lightly hazed bronze color with a full fluffy light cream head. Full aromas of wood and raisins. Light and fluffy in feel, yet full flavored. Light yeast and sweet malt throughout the quaff. Mild in flavor, yet lots of complexity from wood to malt, flowers and dust, as well as nutty and fruity. I will continue to look for this.

2036,"2005-12-09",4.0,"From BA TheBlackMallard, this 750 ml bomber was quite exotic looking, especially considering the fact that it originated in Michigan.  The reddish amber colored beer that resided in it came out bubbly and foamy, and looked quite at home in a tulip. The aroma was mild but complex, evoking soured cherries, plums, freshly cut oak logs, and oranges.  The taste was tart and dry with loads of oak tannins.  A flash of lemon sourness mixed with some brown sugar was apparent as well. Balanced delicately between all the flavors so none was dominant, which made it very easy to drink, despite the sawdust dry mouthfeel.  In the words of Cosmo Kramer from Seinfeld, Wood is Good.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
2036,"2005-12-07",4.0,"Thanks to rater Styles: who for some reason has not yet rated this beer, for sending it down my way! 
Pours a foggy brown darkly hued amber with a bountiful rocky tan head. As all Jolly Pumpkins this beer laces the glass like spraying a can of insolating foam. The aroma has an earthy maltyness to it plenty of biscuity malts and oaked character. The flavor shows itself, as a most authentic recipe should. I find that the nutty malts and gentle spice are most prevalent, some black peppercorn and rosemary rest beneath the suggestions of toasted all-grain bread, walnut, and Brazilian nuttiness. There is a barn like character that is easily noticeable here leather, dried hay, and musty stagnant air help develop the complexity. The body is porous yet lively, rather velvet like. It hops around so much on the palate that it leaves an arid finish. As noted This is about as authentic as it comes. More authentic than 99% of imports that I have sampled which says a lot about Jolly Pumpkins brewer.","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

2036,"2005-11-19",3.9,"Hazy bronze. Sticky, fully sustained dirty-white foam of meringue consistency. Aromatically peppery, plasticy phenols and floral hops flow with abundance into the nose. Lesser notes of honey, fennel, and leather. Finely conditioned, velvety carbonation. Opens with a captivatingly flavorful touch of acidity which matches the peppery phenolic-induced airiness. Complex wave of malt follows suit with a briskly dry earthiness and suitably bready sweetness. Somewhat limp in body, with a profusion of unripe peaches, melon, and passionfruit, which carry the malt weight with little effort. Understated oakiness firms up the and freshly pulverized date foundation. Finishes persistently juicily hoppy, as an imaginative interplay between nutty, earthy, bready malt flavors lessens the soft lacto tartness. Impressively authentic version and another testament to Rons artistic brilliancy. Thanks, Schroppfy.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

2036,"2005-10-25",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2006 This one has tons of potential. Apple orchard, oaky nose. Frothy eggshell white head that looks bubbly from the side of the glass but creamy from the top. Dark, hazy ice tea in color.  Sour on the first swallow. As it warms, the carbonation disappears quickly, which is actually kind of nice. While they are screaming for attention, the oak and toffee notes are too far in the background, however, the tang does hold itself back as it warms. Alcohol is cloaked well.  I drank this far too young and would love to try this 4 years from now. Excellent beer. Rerate 8/17/06. Man, this beer is even better then I thought. Its not as thick as I remember but smooth.

The nose is ensnared with oaken buoyancy, bitter orange peel, coriander, orange & cotton blossoms, perfumey muskiness and peppered citric toffee chews.  Flavor is very oaky this time around.  Orange marmalade and honeydew cohort with Parisian danishes.  Bitter sweetness tells tunes of curacau and coriander.  Mild tart acidity meets nectarine Jolly Ranchers.  Medium-bodied and damn right refreshing, though exhibiting tamed carbonation throughout.  Pils malt authenticity teams with a stale, musky hopiness.  Wholesome clementine sweetness comes through in the finish with a sweet humming marmalade on rye afterlife.  This is not one of the tannic, brett-bellied brews of Rons, giving ample proof that he can control the bacteria if he so chooses.Batch 1, August 2005. Pour a hazy caramel brown color with an oily head and some tan dust streaks.  Aroma unfolds with anise, caramel, sour mash and orange peel.  Quite the alluring cacophony of flavors.  Flavors springboard from the aroma, reacquainting ourselves with anise, caramel, peat, grain, sour figs and crushed bing cherries.

Grapes, wood and berries are obvious, the barrel giving it an edges over your average flemish sour attempt. Not very sour from the nose, but this is worked around in mouth, the woody tartness works well with the fruits and there is indeed an array of undescribable yeasty funky effects, battery acid, branches, wild fruits, though how they work well together Im not sure, they sure make up more astringency than I wish for. Drying out nicely on the palate though, I suspect this is better from an aged bottle, because for now, it is fairly chaotic.

I initially found it to be very wine-like, plenty of wood charateristics and some flower and spice as time marched on.  Medium bodied, somewhat drying.  Very pleasant mouthfeel.  Fruity, woody flavors tend to pervade.  Hops dont seem to be overextended.  Lasting flavor of fruit and wood is pleasant.

2036,"2005-05-15",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 6, 2006 Rerate again! -- later examples from the second bottling dont have the livliness of the original,not just in carbonation but in the rich interplay of flavors. Rerate: After several more examples in bottled form, I have to say this is incredibly rich and mature in its lactic leatheryness. A delightful beer and highly recommended. Flavor goes up a bit from 8 to 9, and overall by one point too...Original: This is a prerelease version of the beer. Weve decided to rate it, I think, because we thought it was a great opportunity provided by Ron Jeffries, and because we all thought it was a fine beer now... I like this beer alot - its malty and bready and a touch sour, but has a kind of peppery element and a good bit of wood. Leathery fruitiness is the phrase that comes to mind for the flavor...Nice mouthfeel (pretty creamy), and a very nice copper color. Ron considers this a ""work in progress"".
