3428,"2016-06-23",4.0,"750 mL bottle shared by Doug with Chris, Ryan, and I. The pour is a darker medium brown with a nice reddish hue to it. There is a lighter tan head that fizzles down leaving a little lace. The aroma is full of dark fruits and a solid roastiness. There is a hint of malt, but its tart and crisp. Awesome sour brown. The flavor matches this. There is a lot of dark fruit and caramel malt shining bright. There is a strong roast on the back and and just the tart sourness that is well balanced. The mouth feel is a little thicker than Id like with a soft, yet crisp carbonation. There is a tart roasty cherry aftertaste that just invites another drink.

3428,"2016-03-26",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Blackberry and black grape fruitiness accompanies roasted cereals into vinous acidity in this flavorful but mildly puzzling brew.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the brown-hued black.
-The juxtaposition of overt roastiness and acetic acid takes some getting used to.
-The mouthfeel is on the dry side, with soft, natural carbonation.
-This was perfect for a pâté du Périgord.

3428,"2014-03-16",4.2,"Darkish appearance and nice creamy head actually. Great developed taste profile, I like the darker malts in here to balance the funky aromas. Very drinkable too and not the slightest hint of that alcohol. Refreshing even, despite the layered taste profile. Lovely made, with care. Stunning funky ale.

3428,"2014-03-15",4.0,"Bottle (750 ml). Shared by Fux, thanks! Brown with reddish reflects, a small off-white head and good lacing. Aroma is of red fruits, red wine, wood, light acidic notes, nice tartness and hints of ketchup. Taste is of red fruits, red wine, light caramel, wood and hints of ketchup. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Slightly dry finish. Not the most complex Sour Red that I have tried, but its really tasty and well balance. Nice drinkability too. Well crafted. I loved it!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
3428,"2014-02-08",3.8,"Pours a dark brown hue; tons of tan head & lace. Gorgeous.  Dark, soured fruit peels amidst the Bretty funk base. Oaky. Surprisingly balanced sourness; the flavors here all play off each other nicely. So much balance, damn tasty.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"
3428,"2014-01-05",4.0,"A - pours hazy dark cola with nice 1 finger tan head and spotty lacing. S - tart berries, oak, toasted malts, rye?, some alcohol. M - tart and smooth. Nice fluffy carb. Dry.

3428,"2013-12-30",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2016 Nice light sour brown. Great woody whiskey barrel aroma. Tan wispy head. Looks like coffee. Notes of lemon and rind. Light Barrel. Funk. Bitter finish
I prefer their dark sours over their blondes. Quite the mixologists there at Sante!","Santa Clara, California, USA","mrhoppy"
3428,"2013-12-16",3.3,"9th December 2013Tasting at Bruces pad. A Brucey bonus! Almost clear brown beer. Small pale tan head. Palate is crispy and dry. Sharp sourness. A little dark fruits and a whisper of coffee. Light sour lactose. Crispy dry finish. Not bad but a little too much lactose go be better.",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"

Nose is mild coffee beans and milk chocolate - mocha like, lemon biscuit, touch of aniseed, grapefruit and funk. Taste is loaded with dry and roasty coffee, bright citric fruits, touch tropical in mandarin and tangerine. Some mild chocolate powdery feel to it. Solid as","Perth, AUSTRALIA","maneliquor"
3428,"2013-12-09",4.1,"Bottle shared at Bruces in London - big thanks to Bruce. Pours clear red-brown with a frothy tan head. The nose holds tangy, dark berries, leather, suggestions of cocoa. Light sweet flavor, pretty dry, some toasty bread, leathery dark fruits, mellow funk. Light to medium bodied with average carbonation. Dynamic finish, lightly toasted malts, funky and leathery berries, subtle citric sour bite. Lovely.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
3428,"2013-11-24",3.9,"Bottle from release. Aroma and multiple flavors here. The most similar SARA beer to this one is Adjunct Professor w/boysenberries, except there's less fruit and more of a wild yeast profile. Some cocao, coffee and berry here. Very good beer.","California, USA","timfoolery"
3428,"2013-11-11",4.2,"Bottle shared at Ratebeer Gallery II. Dark brown pour with a tan head. Nose of cocoa and roasted malt, with red fruit peeking through and a lactic citric tartness. Flavor confirms this, dark chocolate and graham, cranberries, citrus drupelets, pumpernickel, grape skins, nuts.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
3428,"2013-11-06",4.3,"On draught at the better Toronado (SD). Nose is tart cherries and Pinot noir. Taste is tart cherries, red wine and a perfect amount of funk. Palate is fantastic.","San Diego, California, USA","tleaver33"
3428,"2013-11-06",4.1,"Tap at Toronado SD. Inky pour, no foam. Rich sour brown nose, sweeter red grape, oud bruin style cranberry and cocoa mix. Taste is very nicely lactic with lime citric. Juicy red grape makes this one of the most vinous examples of sour brown. Long, yogurt palate with lime bite make this easy to handle. No alcohol presence. Very successful sour brown. As its warms, nose opens up to rich pecan pie and hazelnut. Awesome.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3428,"2013-11-06",3.7,"On tap at toronado... Pours a deep silky solid black hue, consistent throughout, and topped with a thin film of off-white head... Aroma of grainy cocoa, little roast, and sour dark fruit and plum... Mild roast and cocoa, sour grape and dark fruit. Tart sourness throughout, moreso than expected. Medium bodied with prickly carbonation.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
3428,"2013-10-28",3.8,"Bottle, big thanks to Mayur for giving me his extra bottle! Aroma is moderately yeasty, with the classic Sante funk that whiffed towards musty cheese and wood. As it breathes the beer exudes a melange of earthy funk, roasted malts, spice and a kiss of fruit. The beer pours a dark brown/borderline black with little to no light shining through. There is small beige head and decent lacing. Taste is very similar to that of Loves Armor (no surprise), with moderate roasted malts, tobacco, some yeast funk, and very light chocolate. The beer has medium body and a somewhat creamy/lactic mouth. Finish is not very dry and no signs of barrel astringency. Overall, the beer reminds me of a less fruity version of Loves Armor, and one of the better dark farmhouse beers Ive tried. The barrel kind of hides in the background leaving the dark malts to shine.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
3428,"2013-10-27",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 28, 2013 Very cool - I miss the release and still get to input the first rating :). Thanks a ton to Felipe & Mayur for sharing with me! Bottle. Pour is dark black with a small tan head and nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is yeasty funky - that special SARA funk as Felipe says, roasty, barnyard, tobacco. Flavor is much the same, light sweet and medium funky. Dark roasty notes are present but clearly take a back seat in the overall profile. Medium body, quite nice.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
