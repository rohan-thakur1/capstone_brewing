1091,"2017-05-04",3.9,"500 ml bottle bought at Just Green in SoHo, Central.
Looks: Translucent pale pear juice colour; Near zero head with residual soapy white foam which fades in 5 seconds; No lacing with active carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant and very sweet pear wine, with strong yoghurt tartness, strong alcohol, sandalwood, funk, nice pear flesh, strong floral, strong sugar and strong tannic.

Taste: Medium sweet pear wine, with very strong yoghurt tartness, alcohol, strong liquorices, pear flesh, funk, sugar, fair wood barrel and tannin.

Body: Light body. Quite slick palate. 

Mouth Feel: Strong and fleshy pear wine with very well balanced strong sweetness and strong yoghurt tartness, touched by nice funky wood barrel throughout. Quite boozy with strong liquorices and fair tannin for a chop-licking medium bitter finish. Very nice!

After Taste: Fairly dry. Sweet, boozy funky and bitter to mouth.

Comments: This one is strong in aroma and taste - fruity peary, sweet, tart, boozy and woody - with the funky character an unexpected bonus. More than a match for my favourite Marks & Spencer Pear Cider, this is sweet strong cider at its best. Recommended!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

1091,"2014-10-16",4.2,"This is nice better than fake pear ciders and I like them ha. But I feel special drinking this bit weird but pears are. Much sweeter than cider. But not to bad, too thin and refreshing to be called medicinal, heady buzz nice not mind blowing but special enough","","Stillsane"
1091,"2014-06-14",4.0,"500ml bottle from Dunkertons Cider Farm, Herefordshire. Pours clear gold, with a sweet fruity perry aroma. Taste is distinctive Dunkertons; fruity, exceedingly well blended and underpinned by just the right amount of tannins.. I could drink this all day long.","Shrewsbury, Shropshire, ENGLAND","minutemat"
1091,"2013-07-13",3.4,"50cl bottle. Pours golden and slightly hazy with very gentle bubbles. The nose has over-ripe pear. The taste confirms the over-ripeness but finishes with a dry tangy finish. Im not sure why the scores for this are so low - theres obviously depth of flavour and a good balance between initial sweetness and the dryness of the finish. I like this.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","AshtonMcCobb"

1091,"2006-02-17",3.3,"Bottle from Waitrose. Hey a bottled Perry. I was surprised. I admit that I am somewhat of a fan of this style of alcoholic refreshment.  Greeny gold colour with disappearing white head. Not intense pear aroma. Bit of rubber in mouth with nice solid pear flesh. Finish has some dryness, but mostly fruit. Very clean. Fruit gets better as it goes on. No real complexity, but nicely subtle.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
1091,"2005-01-02",2.8,"Pale yellow & gold.  Aromas are sweet pear with some wood, has something of the farmyard about it.  Flavours are sweet and peary (is that an adjective?) with more of the Dunkertons ""wood and the trees"" oakiness at the finish.  I think this is the only perry I have seen bottled.  Pretty good.  My fondest memory of Perries is my fest-newby friend puking it up at Peterborough beer fest a few years back - after just a pint of the stuff.  Ah, perries.","Wigston, Leicestershire, ENGLAND","leaparsons"
