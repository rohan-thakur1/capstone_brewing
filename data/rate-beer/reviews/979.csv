I think I found my new summertime IPA. If Beverages & More continues to carry this incredible elixer, then I will continue to purchase because it has everything I love in a nice IPA. The only thing better would be if they made it more. 

The beer starts out with a clear ""hiss"" and gas escaping as the cap is pulled off, looking like the lid of an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus had just been lifted after 3,000 years of solitude. The beer pours out a light amber color, crystal clear. Tight bubbles form at the base, and as the beer reaches mid-glass a rather large, pillowy head forms. So much so, that when the beer glass is emptied into my glass, a 2"" head has formed above the glass, sitting there like a contorted sculpture from a brewers dream. The head has incredible staying power, like a meringue of a pie made in the hands of a master chef. 

The aroma coming from the glass starts out rather tame. Light lemongrass, very floral, smells a little like grass or weeds when it gets wet. But after some time to let the head die down, and let the temp warm up a bit is when the aroma really comes thru. Strong phenols, medium spicy notes, a touch of funky-leather-jacket-rubbed-with-lemon-zest and much more farmhouse saison notes than a traditional American/WC pale ale. 

The first few sips of this hammered me with statement ""this aint no sweet East Cost pale ale/IPA"". Bone dry due no doubt to the brett swimming around in this beer chomping on any molecule of sugar it meets. The tartness left behind in its aggressive wake, along with the lemony-funky nature of brett, the earthy/straw-like, bitter apple peppery-ness just melds incredibly well together. Not for those that like sweet beers, its decidedly Belgian in its approach with a unique American twist on it from the masters at Green Flash. Just a clean, bright, funky treat that was made for beer geeks like me. Thank you Green Flash, for always keeping me in mind...lol.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

979,"2014-08-12",3.1,"Reviewed from notes.
This was poured into a chalice.
The appearance was a decent hazy orange color with a two finger white head. The lacing was somewhat there and trickling but trying to stick.
The smell had a wonderful blend of fruit and yeast with notes of candy sweetness. There was a light fruit ranging close to the citrus, mango, and a light pineapple. There were some notes of a green apple sourness.
The taste took those previously mentioned flavors to encapsulate a warmingly sweet sort of fruity stickiness.
On the palate, this one sat right about a medium on the body with a tad of sessionability but honestly, this one seemed to make me want to sip it a bit.
Overall, so there is a slight sour-ness but its nothing overly done. Would I have this again? Probably.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

979,"2014-07-24",4.1,"Transfer from BA review on 7-17-12 - 
 Poured from bottle into tulip glass

 Appearance  The beer pours with a nice hazy orange color with an enormous white head. The head is insanely huge with multiple pours needed to get the 12 oz bottle into a ~ 20 oz pint glass. Eventually it does fade however, to give a light amount of lacing. 

 Smell  The smell was a wonderful blend of fruit and yeast with notes of candy sweetness. The fruit was largely of citrus, mango, and a light pineapple. These aromas mingle with some other lighter aromas as well. There is also a light presence of floral hop and some notes of a green apple sourness. One wonderful smell.

 Taste  The taste starts out with a nice malty and fruity flavor. A citrus and tropical fruit sweetness mixed with a nice biscuit base. As it moves on some grapefruit citrus and a lighter floral hop come to the tongue. Accompanying these hop flavors are tastes of sour Brett yeasty flavors. As the taste advances further and goes toward the end it sours even more with other notes of more bitter hop coming to the tongue. In the end it leaves a bitter and sour flavor on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the light to medium side for the 7 % abv. As for the carbonation, it is on the slightly higher side (as would have been perceived from the super heavy head). The lighter body was slightly off putting for the hop and malt flavors, but it was good for the more sour and bitter flavors. The higher carbonation level did the same as the body and really accentuated the sour flavors of the brew. 

 Overall  A tasty sour beer with probably one of the best aromas of a beer I have ever smelt. One I would go to again given the chance.","","Darkmagus82"

Mouth feel is medium-bodied, with low carbonation and a gentle alcohol warming.

I see this compared to Orval, but I dont think I agree - the brett is much more pronounced than Orval, and the fruit less so. This is more like Gato Negro, with its heavy-handed brett funk, albeit with a little more West Coast character.

A whole lot about this beer is a perfectly potable parody of a nouvelle vague Belgian saison: huge seafoam head, huge white pepper and pollen and springtime peach blossom nose, flowery and dry to the extreme. Orval comes to the p distracted palates mind, before it thinks better of the analogy, leaving emulation to its own devices. Taste is marked by dryness, concentrated daffodils, green apple peel and old dried citrus rind.

The beer is a cloudy orange-gold (murky by the end of the bottle thanks to conditioning) with a light, pillowy head. The lace is runny, and doesnt stick. By the finish, the head is a dishwater film atop the beer. The tongue is hit by a medium / medium-high bitterness with a light sweetness to support it. Theres also a hint of cheesy umami in there too. Lots of light, fizzy carbonation help the medium-full bodied beer to maintain an oily texture. The finish is a dry pine, pepper, and citrus peel.

979,"2014-04-14",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 30, 2014 Apparently this beer is being put into retirement by GF, so I wanted to get in a bottle and rating for posterity. One of the most interesting beers theyve ever done, and in fact a fascinating beer in the entirety of American brewing. Its not Orval, but its a very interesting WC take on Orval, with a nose that is bretty as hell while conveying a lot of herbacious hop character. The flavors are delightfully spicy brett/herb union with a lasting bitterness in the finish. Theres maybe a slight hint of sweet orange peel. Bone dry. Far from my favorite beer, but there are few as distinctive as this one.

Every time I try this beer again, it grows in my estimation.  Drinking my last bottle (currently, I plan on buying all that sits around Gainesville) and its about 2 years of age.  Nose bustles with hints of lemon and mint and evergreen.  Insane carbonation and a pretty strong bitterness define the palate/taste.  Excellent summer drinker.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"

This one gushed on me. Poured quickly into Oxbow tulip. Enormous frothy head. Long-lasting. Took three pours to empty the bottle. Bit of lacing. Pours a slightly hazy bronze straw color.

Excellent Brett aroma. Easiest to find beer with that distinct Brett. There's some floral and fruity ester notes as well. A bit of sour cherry.

Taste is prominent Brett. Probably the oldest RV I've had based upon that. Less fruit and sweetness on tongue than nose. Some subtle hops more present than usual. Maybe a bit of oak and sour fruit.

Nice mouthfeel. Light medium with great carbonation, just shy of prickly. Very dry, as usual.

One of the best readily available Brett beers. Hopefully the shift from 12 oz to bomber won't change that. At this level of age this is closer to a heavily bretted saison than a BPA but still very good.

T - Follows the nose with lots of spice upfront, lemons, orange, pineapple, mango skin, dried papaya, white grapes, pears, hints of banana. Pale malts in the background with plenty of grassy hops. Finishes with a spicy and dry bitterness.

M - Aggressive carbonation adds a prickly bite and lightens up the body quite a bit. Creamy, dry feel.

Sublime aroma on this beer. Its like funky Belgian tropical nirvana. Hoppier than i thought it would be. The flavors seem to effortlessly marry together. This is my kind of beer.

So, I knew this would be overcarbed, but this was stupid. It took a pitcher to pour this 12oz bottle. Nice clear golden underneath. Retained none of the foam once it died down. Smells nice with raisin, pale belgian yeast character, some hints of grain and metal and a bit of bitterness; some green apple skins and meat come through as it warms. Flavor is fruity, apple, lemon, honeydew and grain, some clay and a touch of strep mutans (maybe thats my mouth though). Medium bodied with now minimal carb and an off dry finish.

Fortunately for Brett amateurs, the barnyard funk only appears in the taste. Funky freshness and cobwebs lurk in the depths of the flavor, though brightened by the elegant taste of rosewater and a heavy hit of perfume. The nose doesnt carry any of the brett, but instead pushes smells of iris, lily, and the relaxing air of the botanical gardens.

Nice light bretty notes that play well with the dry bready maltiness and a beautiful floral hoppiness.  A little tropical fruitiness and cotton candy like notes.  The flavor isnt quite as refined and nuanced as the original though.  Its got the nice subtle hoppiness and dryness of the original, but the malt is a bit heavier and the carbonation level is a little too lively and fizzy, causing it to froth up and ruin the mouthfeel a bit.  Lighter bodied with that intense carbonation level, it finishes dry with a floral hop note.

Floral hops, spicy, just the right amount of funkiness and Belgian yeast phenols and esters.  Just a touch of tart wet grain and a hint of stone fruit ( keep getting whiffs of apricots and pear).

979,"2013-02-28",3.9,"Fantastic American take on an Orval style Belgian Ale.  I have to be honest, the only thing I can really ding Green Flash on is the fact that these beers are over carbonated.  Over carbonated to the point where its extremely difficult to poor.  Ive gone through 2 4-packs now and every one instantly fills the glass with head.  Actually, forget even drinking it out of the bottle.  Your mouth will be full of foam as soon as it hits. Kind of obnoxious, but the payoff is worth it.

The smell is of earth, brett, and candy sugars.  The taste is dry and tart.  Good hoppy aroma and bitterness.  All around one of the best American examples of what a funky Belgian ale should be, with the American (hoppy) twist. If Green Flash could tame down the carbonation a bit, this would probably be my go to beer when I wanted something Belgiany, especially for the price.","USA","deliciosity"

Crazy aroma: notes of melon and sour orange with lots of tropical flavours too from the hops. A big brettanomyces presence is there as well with all that dusty barnyard flavour. The taste meanwhile doesnt quite live up to the nose. It continues the fruity aspects of the aroma but this is where it starts to feel more like an IPA than a Belgian ale. Still, this is an American take on the style, not a carbon copy, so thats not an issue. More of that brett coming through as as the slightly sour undercurrent that underpins everything. Mouthfeel is quite soft and it makes for easy drinking. Overall this is a really good effort from Green Flash.","Cheshire, ENGLAND","Nocturne"
979,"2013-02-05",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
Brettanomyces, flowers and eau de cologne allusions whirl about in this dry, very drinkable Wild Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sizeable head of foam clings to the misty amber shine (looks great without the yeast pour).
-Carbonation is appropriately high yet soft on the palate (not biting).
-The nose is amazingly Orval-like.
-The flavor profile is of a medium intensity.
-This is not the most complex offering, but it sure is well-made and greatly satisfying.

So much aroma to this beer with huge lemon zest and other melons with a hint of some Belgium yeast maybe. Love the ""funk"" this beer has. The taste hits you with some bite on the front, not hoppiness but rather as if it were lemon zest. This mellows out nice with some really nice tang and then finishes nice and dry.

979,"2012-12-30",3.3,"This was my second bottle of this beer. As a matter of fact, it will be the first I have been able to sample because the first made it across the Pacific to New Zealand, sat briefly in my possession and then the bottom broke off, spreading in a sour, bubbly puddle across my garage. I am thankful it didnt happen on my livingroom carpet. I am also thankful it didnt happen within cooee of MrsJimthechap or this rating would never have occurred.
Rayon Vert is a murky orange brew with voluminous white head that took up an easy 60% of the glass. Left to settle it gave good head and some lace. Aromas of freshly squeezed orange juice, some grapefruit and a definite nod to its Belgian origin. I have read that the brewer intended this beer to be as close to its origin without reference to Saccharomyces and I am of the mind that if beer had never had Louis Pasteur and the chaps from Carlsberg et al, Green Flash would still be sought after. It wasnt pungently basement or needlessly sour. It still had the approach-ability of a new world spontaneously fermented ale (if a little lively, considering my first bottle sadly missed).
Tasting unveiled that tartness, lemon, orange, citron and then peel. It had a nod to unripe apricot as its malt component but sour tartness was the boss of this choir. Lipsmacking and an  interesting sideshow to other beers from this stable, but I would assert that we were gifted advances in yeast culture an inoculation and should make the best of this. I would leave Belgian Ale to the Belgians. Sorry*.

*Not sorry at all, love your work Green Flash and love Belgian ale. You just dropped a bollock.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
979,"2012-12-29",3.1,"Orange color with good sized white head. Earthy hoppy smell with citrus, pine, soap. Highly carbonated with a crisp hop bite and a soapy tinge to the taste as well.

Pours with a huge head of foam. So much so that it takes several minutes to completely drain the bottle. Body is a hazy dark orange with amazing head retention and lacing.

Aroma is almost all Brett. I can detect some lemon coming through but barely underneath the barnyard funk.

The taste is largely the same: Brett. Now I do love this flavor in the correct style or if properly balanced but that is not the case here. Im not sure of the age of this beer but the Brett has really taken over leaving just a faint hint of lemon and bread underneath and nearly no bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft with a slightly sticky finish.

Bright orange at first and then very hazy as the yeast makes its way into the glass. Little bit of head and a little lace on the glass. The smell is fruit, slight hops and a very subtle hint of the brettanomyces yeast, not bad. The flavor is a little fruity and then a hint of bitterness that reminds me of aspirin without being offensively medicinal. Sort of dry on the tongue too.

Flavour wise you get lots of lemon, a touch of apple, and a tart, tangy, rather salty, dry finish which dominates the modest sweetness up front. This has some saison like character to it, but its more in your face. The carbonation is too high in my view. Gotta say Im quite disappointed with this.

979,"2012-10-09",3.7,"This unique beer has somewhat of a hazy light orange/gold color and an off-white head.  It definitely looks Belgian in style.  The aroma is very soapy and barnyard-like, and just a little of manure, a little wet grass, and hint of chicken poop.  It, honestly, reminds me of the rodeo (a green one).  That said, its aroma is very strong, but oddly enough unoffensive (considering).

A little sweetness contributes in the flavor; otherwise, those green barnyard characteristics carry through in the mouth.  A clean, grassy, slightly yeasty quality assists this beer down the hatch, leaving a, still, very greenness in the finish.  A great selection and use of hops really makes this beer work.  As odd as it sounds, its actually very impressive and Im very glad that Green Flash pulled this off so well.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

979,"2012-10-02",3.2,"0.355l bottle. This is a light gusher - so much that Im glad I opened it at the kitchen, and it pours a step-wise blurry almost glowing orange-golden body with a massive massive fluffy off-white head.

Not horrible, but not great either. Its heavy on the carbonation and it feel a bit fizzing and thin in the mouth. More of that near smoky thing in the taste. A bit overwhelming actually, and there is definitely something reminding me of a little infection going on here. Light yeasty with red grapes, clementines and its quite dry.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, light, orangey amber with incredible carbonation and a slightly bigger than average, creamy, off-white head that diminished very slowly leaving a nice nice sheet to the finish. The aroma contained light caramel, candy sugar and pale malt; slight to moderate flower, perfume, citrus and mint hops; moderate to heavy dough, barnyard, leather, funky and spicy yeast; and light colored fruit. The initial flavor was slightly sweet, lightly acidic and slightly sour; while the finish was lightly sweet, light to moderately acidic; moderate to heavily bitter and lightly sour with a fairly long duration. There was pale malt, a little caramel, light but artisanal bread, citrus hops, perfume and flower hops, a little tropical fruit, funky yeast, doughy yeast some leather and spicy yeast.

979,"2012-08-25",3.9,"Poured into a tulip. Looking forward to this one for some reason.

A: Pours a...HOLY BAJEEZUS LOOK AT THE HEAD ON THIS THING! For the briefest of split seconds, I thought it was infected, then I realized nope, this is just a brett beer. Anyhoo, the beer pours a milky golden yellow color with vibrant carbonation trails rising to the top. Like I said before, the head on this is truly epic, taking up 3/4ths of the entire glass after non-aggressively pouring the beer for a couple seconds. The heads color is eggshell. At first, the head starts off with big bubbles and a soapy texture, but as the yeast near the bottom is mixed in, the head becomes denser in its construction. Massive clumps of lacing are left on the glass as the head retains itself in infuriating fashion. Aesthetically jaw-dropping.

S: The scent is downright bi-modal; at first I get bubblegum, cream soda, peppermint, candied sugar, and licorice. Once the beer has been left to sit a while, notes of grass, band-aids, and yes, horse blanket-y funk. Extremely interesting to say the least.

T: Initially has a slightly sour, phenolic edge to it. This ultimately gives way to a grassy, funky finish, with traces of bubblegum and citrus abounding. Also features a general graininess throughout resembling a good pilsener. After lovingly waxing on how beautiful this looked and how great it smelled, Im disappointed I dont have more to say on this one. Its just a solid, well made BPA with a (welcome) funky twist, nothing that blows the mind, but one that refreshes nicely on a warm late spring day. For what its worth, this is the second Green Flash beer that smelled much better than it tasted.

M: Quite astringent...after several successive sips, though, this astringency calms down to become a general dryness. It still manages to be refreshing despite its heavier texture, which is damn hard to pull off. Well carbonated without being overly intense.

O: It is what it is, and thats a solid no-frills pale ale with a nice brett infusion. The funk may require a little getting used to, but this is a great place to start for drinkers unfamiliar with brett beers.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

979,"2012-08-22",3.6,"Bottle. Head is initially large, frothy/creamy, off-white, and eternal. Body is hazy light amber, bottle conditioned.

Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Well, the raw/green resinous hop odor is really unfortunate (and un-Belgian), but otherwise this has lots of potential. Several months of cellaring will hopefully allow the crude hop nose to die down and the secondary characteristics (including the Brett, which is already evident) to stand out.

It is 90* as I drink this, so this beer probably isnt as cold as it should be, but the 7% alcohol is hidden well enough. Tons of carbonation. This is a beer I would not expect from Green Flash.

979,"2012-06-20",3.8,"A lasting sheet of small white bubbles stays atop the veiled gold. Resinous and wild flowery Brettanomyces Bruxellensis takes a lot of room in this gently horsey, highly estery (yellow and orange fruits) ale which, when relatively cold, feels much lighter than 7%, but when it warms up, has quite an alcohol kick stepping in, together with higher alcohol vapors. Despite the beer being a few months old, hops are still quite evident, but they are interestingly matching the Brett flavours with furthermore flowery and oily resin nuances. In mouth, the palate is well dried out, throwing spicy yeast notes all around. The bready malts seem content with their support role and are dominated by the vigorous effervescence, evolving into a small-bubbled foaminess once the beer has settled for a few minutes. There are a few things I would prefer otherwise, but my general impression is very positive here despite having always prefered Green Flash for their hoppy stuff than belgian attempts. Less alcohol and lesser ester and higher alcohols would make it Orvalesque and gorgeous to me, but as it is, it remains pretty good stuff and something I would drink a six-pack of during a party with pleasure.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

979,"2012-05-27",3.7,"Pours into a towering, loose, fluffy, off-white head that takes its time receding into a hazy amber-orange body. The nose is a blend of dry Brettiness and light, fruity yeast notes (pear and apple). Also present is a distinct vinyl note that is a surprisingly pleasant addition to the medley. Once the head dissipates, however, the vinyl note nearly disappears and the aroma becomes more integrated with a touch of spice added to the mix. The palate is light to medium-bodied with soft, fine carbonation and a drying, somewhat tart and moderately funky/sour (good funk) finish. The flavor is less fruity than the nose, with the Brett dominating the flavor profile: horse blanket funk and a mild white pepper note take front stage over a pale malt back that just hints at the apple and pear notes found in the aroma. Quite drying and funky with additional phantom notes of leather and peach pit dancing in and out of focus. This is the kind of beer that could simultaneously scare craft beer newbies away from ""Belgian-Style"" Pale Ales and make Brett fans hear ""Ode to Joy"" in their heads. I lie somewhere between those two groups. I enjoy the nuances that it possesses but I would have preferred it have dialed-in closer to where the nose is at this point. This is definitely an interesting beer, and if Brett is your thing, this is a good candidate to cellar and crack one every 3-6 months to see how it evolves.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"

979,"2012-05-18",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2012 Pours hazy orange with a bit much of the off white fizz. Aromas are mild with a grainy caramel and pale malt Belgian character. The taste is smooth, grainy, and it has a traditional Belgian pale malt and yeast taste that works very well with the mild wet hay and flowery herb hops. The malt stands out like a good pale ale and has a light warming sense, although there us a nice floral fruity sense under the grain, maybe as much from the hops as the yeast. The head never does die out and the carbonation stays high for a while but gets low enough to take big gulps after a bit . There is a slightly oily hop kick in the finish but the carbonation cuts through and the semi sweet grain comes out in the long run with just a bit of bitterness. Very enjoyable and probably the best American Belgian pale I?ve had. Only set back is the fact it?s hard to get a sip through all the fizz at first. Hoppy, some Brett funk and maybe some wheat grain spice? all just one part of this great brew.","Raytown, Missouri, USA","freeofthoughts"
979,"2012-05-18",3.1,"Serving: 12 oz. bottle from Wegmans Leesburg.  It pours a nice copper color with a huge, rocky white head.  Definitely a little over carbonated.  The nose is a mix of Belgian yeast, a little candy sugar, lots of grass and a bit of tropical fruit.  The mouthfeel is a little flabby.  There are some grass notes on the front and back, a little yeast, and a little sweetness.  That sweetness is quickly washed away by the overcarbonation leading to a club soda-esque finish.

The brettanomyces is certainly present in the aroma: it smells quite sour and slightly off. There are some grapefruit and lemon hops up front, which segue into more sourness. There are some weak grainy malt notes, and an unusual faint sweetness towards the finish. This really isnt a great beer. It is not pleasantly sour in the manner of a wild ale, it justs tastes and smells off. Judging by this sourness and the vigour with which the head forms, it seems to me that they may have just gone a bit overboard with the brettanomyces.

The look: Cloudy golden-amber body topped by medium off-white head with medium retention
In long: Nose is superbly wild/bretty, very bright, plenty of flowery funk.  Wow thats brett used right.

The beer seems to be generously hopped and with aromatic hops mixed with the floral funk, the beer becomes a big semi-bitter flowers bouquet.

Sits, just shy of bright and dazzling in the lights; a deep, orange amber with very sparse and very fine carbonation. A top up with the rest of the beer it disperses a fine haze of yeast that turns it pastel in tone. Got a nice tweak of the funked-up, hessian-sack, Brett notes coming through on the nose. A good whiff of salted white cheese, drift-wood, mouse hair, white bread dough too with inklings of ripe, soft, tropical fruits to round it off nicely; very pleasing and subtle. Dry, tart, woody and all consumed Brettanomyces charged palate. Hops in equal synch. I half expected it to be rife with resinous US hops but this is so pleasingly balanced. Body is firm, not light, not heavy, with the carbonation offering to elevate it well and pierce every seem, every nook, every cranny of the mouth. Flavour reminiscent of hessian-sack, driftwood and vine-clippings, tart strawberries and peachy fruit esters, vanilla and musk candy in late.

979,"2012-02-26",3.9,"Bottle from Spirits Lacey. Pours out a slightly cloudy golden color with a pillowy off white head.

There was a rich complexity to it, really balanced well with other beers that were served at the party.  Would happily try again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"

Flavor is heavy on the Brett, sour horse blanket and rye, then bitterness.  After taste is more sour with lingering barn yard.  Overall I dont like it, Brett dominates blocking out everything else.

979,"2012-02-23",3.5,"1st pour ----- Start of bottle. Fresh clean pour but no sediment or yeast cakes. Golden orange pour. Transparent. Looks rich but clean. Nose of lemon pepper. Some barn yard and funk on here. Not overwhelming, but that Belgian style presence is felt. Hops are here too but not the stuff of new world IPAs. More pilsner... noble hops. Other spices here too. Some medicinal qualities. Decent but not my favorite. Would prefer a little more bready and creamy yeastiness to mellow out the sharper pepper and hop flavors.
2nd pour- ------- Next pour is with down to the end of the bottle. Sediment on bottom and yeast cakes included. Much preferred this way. The stuff at the bottom manages to add flavor and mellow the other harsher characteristics at the same time. Very nice now. Much better balance. Still not my favorite but hell yeah Id drink it again.","Brentwood, Tennessee, USA","MmmcKay"

You start with a bit of pale belgian malt, mixed with a crisp light brett yeastiness, then theres this very light apple tone, all with a very balancing bitterness thats slightly herbal and fun.

Somewhat floral up front with some soft earthy hop tones. Touches of fruity esters with a citrusy edge driven by lemon peel. Spicy notes mixed with clove and a straw/biscuit backbone. A bit funky and tart towards the finish, which is a little dry and lingering.

Overall: Amazing.  Dry, spicy, hoppy, aromatic as can be.  As of this writing, perfectly executed.

Nice nose, full of Brett. The taste is sharp leather, dusty straw and the musky Brett. The hoppiness of the nose is present, though it is in the back seat to the Brett yeastiness. An interesting herbal note comes out in the finish as well. The palate is medium bodied, highly carbonated with a dry Bretty finish.

Full bodied with a chunky mouthfeel and obvious carbonation with a bitter dry finish. The flavor is nice but the funk level is definitely taken down a few notches.

Lingering, earthy hop bitterness was also present, as was lively carbonation, a medium body, and a pleasant, finishing dryness to go along with the bitterness.

979,"2012-02-02",3.0,"This is sort of an Americanized take on Orval. It is a hoppy, wild Belgian brew--though this one has more of a citric character than the fine Trappist ale I just compared it too. Its a cloudy orange w/ an enormous sloppy head. Nose is citric and fruity w/ just a touch of Band-Aid, which is not entirely unpleasant. Palate is very much in the American court. Its medium bodied w/ mild carbonation. This is just a touch sweet w/ a firm, APA-like bitterness in the finish. I think w/ a little more finesse w/ the wild yeasts used, specifically getting some more pineapple fruitiness rather than Band-Aid out of them would be a big plus here.

979,"2012-01-30",4.1,"12oz. bottle.  Nose of fresh Belgian yeast, fruity, spicy, doughy and a bit farmy, some honeyish, bready malt character and almost minty green hops in the background amidst the funk, along with notable clove, citrus and pepper.  Hazy amber-golden color, this can be a nice clear pour if you so choose, or pretty cloudy with a dusting of sediment, I sampled both ways over the 4-pack and like the sediment poured a bit more.  Head is moderately foamy and lasting, with fairly epic lacing.  Flavor profile is very lightly tart, citric and spicy to start, seeing just a touch of sweetness and pale malt flavor, then really showing a huge amount of Belgian yeast character, with clovey spice, esters, phenols and very light Brett horseblanket, finishing lightly bitter, fruity and fairly dry.  Light and active on the palate, nearly refreshing, particularly for 7% abv., body is medium.  Highly enjoyable and tasty, I will certainly be looking for more of this.

979,"2012-01-30",3.5,"Wow! A nice Belgian style ale. I wasnt expecting much on this one so this falls into the category of ""pleasant surprise"". Aroma was alright. That Belgian yeast is full and not much else is getting through. Pour was a light hazy gold and a one finger off white head. Taste was delicious. Probably one of the best American made Belgian style ales Ive had yet. Seriously. Apricot, melon and bubblegum in the front with a sweet candi sugar backbone. Nice dry aftertaste with good carbonation. This ones a winner","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"
979,"2012-01-29",3.9,"A delicious brew that I wish I had the bucks to buy a lot more of.  The body is golden amber with a tall sustained white head.  The aroma has a dusty brett scent over some light tropical fruit and some grainy, bready malt.  The body is light and spritzy and feels peppery on the tongue.  The flavor has a bretty funkiness, bready malt, fruit, and an earthy citric bitterness.  It finishes dry with a peppery bitterness.  Nice.","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
979,"2012-01-28",4.1,"Incredibly well carbonated, a steady pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a four-finger thick, pale tan colored head, that only slowly subsides and leaves a substantial, structural mesa as it does so.  The beer is a darkish amber color that shows some haze and a bright orange-amber hue when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of citrus zest and phenolic, Brettanomyces signature funk, both of which are backed by a solid, supporting grain / malt character.  More specifically notes of Curacoa orange zest, touches of tangelo, with an ample, slightly plastic like, musty, not quite sharp, funkiness and a grain character that reminds me of crackers with just a hint of caramel malt.  The citrus laden, American hop character is quite nice here and definitely works quite well with the Brett character. 

Aggressively carbonated and quite effervescent, my first sip has a biting bitterness and a sort of tartness that is accentuated by the citrusy hop character.  The beer has a fairly light body, with almost no viscous heft, though it doesnt come off as being watery.  The citrus hop character provides flavors of tangelo zest, touches of ruby-red-grapefruit and even a citrus like pine needle character.  The finish is quite dry with a pale cracker like grain character as well as a touch of nutty, toasted malt character; the dryness is also accentuated by a phenolic, sort of funky, slightly musty and even slightly musky Brettanomyces character that is also found in the finish.  The bitterness from the hops combines with the phenolic, sort of plastic like character to provide even more sharpness to this beer.

One cant help but compare this to Orval type beers, this is far, far better than the latest incarnations of Matilda (the last really good batch I had was 2005), and even gives Orval a run for its money (though I wouldnt put this on that level quite yet).  I cant wait to see how these age, but I wonder that the Brettanomyces character is already so pronounced; this cant be that old yet, and the Brett is extremely noticeable already, young Orval is barely kissed by the Brett, so I will be curious to see how these age.  My one worry is that the plastic character from the Brett will get a bit out of control as the beer ages.  Visually this beer is about perfect, from memory it seems a touch darker than Orval, but I could be wrong, and the extensive, long lasting head is quite impressive.  This beer sets itself apart from Orval in its use of expressive, fruity and citrus laden American hops; as a sucker for many an American hop, I cant help but love this beer more for that.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Hops teeter on becoming palate-fatiguing with an unwavering chalky astringency, though a dab of soft peach compensates nicely. In spite of the high attenuation, the center shows some flabbiness as the malt lacks vivid definition and the esters on the unripe-fruit side of the spectrum. Hops also lend ample acid which interferes with the cleaner and more-rounded brett tartness, though a staunch punch of minerals fills the palate and provides some structure. Peppery and sulfury brett-laced finish precedes a fusion of tealeaves and apricot jam. This is a very respectable effortultimately it comes across as a slightly overcrowded, Americanized rendition. Was really yearning for something along the lines of a golden ale with noble hops, pilsner and/or wheat malt and a pinch of Munich. Well-made and perfectly quaffable, however, even if a bit misguided.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Im going to say it...this is more consistently better than Orval in recent years.  I honestly have not had a great bottle of Orval in probably 3 years...its fallen off that much.  Ive consumed countless bottles of this from multiple batches and seriously...every single time I take the first whiff I exclaim out loud ""god DAMN!""  Its a touch sweeter, and thats part of why I enjoy it more...Orval is often overly dry and thin and watery, it just doesnt have a great mouth experience.  And its frequently got too much band-aid phenol too.  Rayon is a dream in aroma, flavor balance, AND mouthfeel.  Its best after about 6 months in the bottle (too resinous when its fresh), and might even be as immortal as Orval (Im drinking a bottle that I think is one year old right now, and its still as bright and fruity as ever).  A truly amazing beer.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

979,"2011-12-30",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 12, 2014 Bottle.  7% seems a little high for the belgian ales Im used to drinking but whatever.  Pours a deep reddish amber with a thick white head.   Nose is hoppy and phenolic, some herbal and spice notes, sugar cubes.  Flavor is weird.  Again, it just feels heavier than it should.  Flavor is dirty hops, quite earthy, more herbal notes, but still lots of sweetness.  Brett hasnt really had enough time to take hold.  Sort of a soapy, dry finish.   Wonder what it would taste like if it was more in the 5 to 6 abv range.  Kinda tastes like every other belgian ipa on the planet. 

Just sampled a 1 1/2 year old bottle which was amazing.  This beer peaks right about now.  Delish.  Upping my rating.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
979,"2011-12-29",3.7,"Bottle @ The BeerMongers...  Poured a golden, coppery orange with a creamy, white head.  Big drying and danky yeast flavors.  Citrus fruits, pepper spice, floral hops and a hint of bitterness.  Mildly brett-like, but not overbearing.  Earthy and full flavored and a little drying towards the finish.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"

979,"2011-12-28",3.7,"Bottle. Pours with a hazed golden hued body with a massive, just barely off white head. Good retention and very respectable lace. Aromas are very funky, horsey, brett brux, leathery, sandal wood, light esters, lots of spicy phenols in addition to the brett funk brigade. Light hops, earthy, spicy and a touch citrusy. A mild hint of chlorophenol. Mild malt character (a bit of grainy). Apple, pear and barnyard. Flavor are straw like, grainy, a bit of cherrio (too young for a funky beer), funky, horsey, bready, grainy, mild bitterness. Slightly floral hop character. Dry, crisp if not for the funk, lively carbonation. Pretty solid.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
979,"2011-12-27",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 11, 2013 Bottle served in a tulip. Pours dark honey with heavy champagne bubbles and a GINORMOUS head. This little 12 oz. bottle filled three glasses! Outstanding retention and lacing. Huge bretty aroma. Also some sweet candi sugar, floral hops, bright grass and spices. Light sweet, medium bitter, light tart flavor. Medium body, creamy-oily texture, average carbonation, and a bitter, dry, light tart finish. The brett is obviously amped up since the last time I had this. This is off the charts for a straight up Belgian ale.","Portland, Oregon, USA","cmonster"
979,"2011-12-27",3.8,"Bottle. It pours a clear orange color with a towering white head. The aroma is very floral with notes of lavender, rose petals, orange and minor hints of phenolic, toasty brett. Not strong, but I definitely pick it up. The flavor is a bit sweeter with some more oranges and peach followed by some floral hops and Belgian spiciness. The mild notes of brett in the finish dries it out some along with the hop bitterness. Really pretty nice.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
979,"2011-12-24",3.4,"So, I wonder if this is a different beer than Treasure Chest.  They seem to be the same description and they happen to be the same abv...though this one has much higher ratings than Treasure Chest; So well see how I feel after this experience.  Bottle.  Big frothy head retains form above the hazed pumpkinesque orange color that sits below.  Nose give forth strong waves of belgian yeast esters, with plenty of banana notes, some mandarine orange characteristics as well.  Flavors are citrusy with a foundation of banana/clove yeast esters, lots of orange flavors from the hops and malt sugars; seemingly balanced.  Tastes like a restrained belgian IPA, I suppose.  Need to let the brett develop though as it doesnt have much, if any, presence at the time being.  Cant really tell if this is different than the Treasure Chest since Ive been drinking through my case for the last several months and the brett in that beer has changed the beer gradually; dont remember how it tasted fresh...though I suppose I could go look at my rating of it, which was from a fresh bottle.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"

979,"2011-12-22",4.0,"12 ounce bottle.  Served in a tulip, the beer pours a slightly hazy amber color with about an inch and a half off-white head that stays around for a long time.  Theres also a good amount of lacing.  The brew smells like citrusy hops (lemon peel, tropical fruit), peppery spice, pears and some bretty funk.  Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like citrusy hops (apricots, orange peel, tropical fruit), peppery spice, bready malt and a bit of brett.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a little creamy and well carbonated.  I think its a good beer.  Ill have to try and save a bottle for a while to see how it changes (or evolves as stated on the label), but thats going to be hard to do!
