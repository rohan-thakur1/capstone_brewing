757,"2017-06-06",3.6,"Obfita piana, kremowa, drobne, średnie i większe pęcherzyki. Dość szybko opada, zostawia lacing. Barwa miedziana, zmętnione.
W aromacie wyraźny banan, karmel, skórka od chleba. Jakby metaliczny aromat, ale na skórze nie ma żelaza. Z czasem przemija, a pojawia się goździk i pieprz. Może to więc fenole dają taki efekt. Leciutka nuta alkoholu.
W smaku na początku słodkawe, bananowe, owocowe, zbożowe, potem przemija uczucie słodyczy i wchodzi taka przypalona skórka od chleba, a potem wytrawny, gorzkawy, mocno fenolowy finisz przypominający piwa belgijskie. Zostawia uczucie pieczenia na języku.
Wysycenie po przelaniu dość niskie. Gdyby pić prosto z butelki to wysokie. Goryczkę chmielową ciężko ocenić przez te mocne pieprzowe fenole, ale na pewno jest, oczywiście na niskim poziomie. Pełnia piwa średnio-niska.","Sosnowiec, POLAND","kryspin3"

The aroma offers a healthy amount of wheat and banana, lighter toasted malts, bread, nuts, and a slight caramel. Regarding this in bitterness and sweetness, they both come across mildly late in he sip. Banana, caramel, and a compliment of apple are given to you initially. Undertones of wheat, yeast, and a bit of spice. Aftertaste is a short wheat. This one is light to medium in body, smooth in texture, and average in carbonation. Very easily drinkable, Id happily enjoy this all evening.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"

La primera sorpresa es que a pesar de ser ""dunkel"", que significa negro, no se trata realmente de una cerveza oscura. Es más bien de un color entre ámbar y marrón considerablemente turbio. Generosa formación de espuma en color vainilla de persistencia media, aspecto cremoso y buena adherencia.

De intensidad media-alta en nariz, da de entrada notas claras de plátano maduro. También hay notas florales, así como un cierto punto picante extremadamente suave. Huele indudablemente dulce y de algún modo recuerda al dulce de leche. También hay pan fresco. Complejidad media.

De entre los sabores básicos destaca el dulce, lo que es totalmente consistente con lo que sugería en nariz. Hay también un punto cítrico que equilibra muy bien el anterior y unas notas saladas muy de fondo. El amargor es también muy tenue. El plátano maduro, el pan blanco fresco y el dulce de leche salen de nuevo en el post-gusto.

De cuerpo medio y textura sedosa y ligeramente espumosa. Llena bien la boca y tiene una persistencia notable con un final dulce y chispeante que nunca llega a ser empalagoso (al contrario que otras cervezas de trigo en las que el dulce parece acumularse en la lengua hasta llegar en ocasiones a hacerse pesadas).

The banana flavor is unmistakable and convey a weissbier that is not too sweet but still belongs to the tasteful and light beer style as a wheat beer should be, even if it is dark. A little bit of roasted malt character with very light caramel and chocolate notes is in the palate. A little bit of citrus aftertaste keeps it in a nice balance so the sweetness does not get too much domination.

On the nose theres quite a lot going on - wheat, malts, overripe bananas, plums, nuts, especially nougat, and weirdly, some alcohol too... Its got this Tosca cake thick sweetness to it, but its also kind of fresh, and fruity. Tastes rather sweet with a home-made apple juice and apple pie very dominant I think, and then some plum liqueur and caramel thats accentuated by sour notes and the thin but active carbonation, and the minimal - but certainly detectable - bitterness.

757,"2015-06-29",3.7,"Bottle, 500ml. Pours golden/orangey brown and extremely cloudy. Head is off-white, lively, and of substantial volume, with long retention. Primary notes on the nose are wholemeal bread, salted caramel, banana, with a backdrop of subtle woodsmoke and smaller notes of a spicy, christmas pudding-esque character. A bit later the aroma takes on a mustier, more farmyard-esque nature with hints of apple (or apple pie/crumble) and other fruits I cant quite make out. Very interesting so far. Taste is initially sweet and malty though following this is a more neutral, pastry-esque character with a lot of cereal. Not massively complex in this regard but has a hearty feel to it. Finish is very dry for the most part (like the standard Hefeweizen) and what little aftertaste is akin to that of weetabix, with some VERY subtle bitterness. Palate wise, body is a decent medium while the texture seems a little too thin and watery but this doesnt bring it down much.

Definitely too cold (about 4 degrees Celsius) when I first poured. Flavours initially suppressed. As it approached cellar temp, it developed a sweetness with light roasted malt finish. Zero bitterness. Stronger malt as the beer came to a more normal temp. Even though the head was large and the initial carbonation was lively, it settled quickly into a fine bead.

757,"2014-12-30",3.8,"500ml bottle into a tulip. From notes.

A: Pours a hazy dark brown color. The head is a roughly-textured one finger heavy cream shade, featuring poor retention and no lacing. Not one of the prettier weizens Ive encountered.

S: The typical weizen melange is here - banana, cloves, wheat, and noble hops, with the cloves being the most dominant note by a hair. Once it warms up a hair, caramel and brown sugar notes appear. Certainly a very good aroma, just not quite as inviting as their standard weizen.

T: It starts with pleasant notes of caramel and wheat, before its ester character (cloves, mostly) and ever-so-slight hoppiness finishes it off. While its pretty damn simple, everything is in near-perfect balance, creating a fairly effortless brew.

M: While its a bit sweeter than their standard weizen, its still fizzy, light, and easy to drink. The body here seems to be fuller in texture, as well. As such, this is slightly more decadent-feeling.

O: Make no mistake, this really hits the spot in all the right ways. This is yet another solid offering from Weihenstephaner.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

This was poured into a weizen glass.
The appearance had a nice dark brown color with a three finger white foamy head that moderately dissipated and left a great deal of foamy white lacing sticking finely to the glass.
The smell had a wonderful amount of sweet sticky chocolate to coat over some light banana along with some sweet German malts. I also get some light cinnamon as the beer warms up a bit.
The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors to town and made a super nice sweet yet still had that slight cinnamon spice underneath.
On the palate, this one sat right at a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about this one. The carbonation was good for the style and for me as it was just right on par all around.

757,"2014-04-02",4.0,"Look: Pours with large, very thick, billowy, off-white (yellow hue) head. It has a beautiful, slow retention that leaves medium sized, creamy, thick layer on the top. It stays till the end and leaves fair amount of lacing. Colour is cloudy, creamy toffee, caramel, like milk chocolate sundae shake - delicious. Also lots of active carbonation, lots of bubbly chains. 


Smell: Clove and banana classic. Bit peppery, fresh sweet peeled apples, red earth. Grain, wheat, hay with light darker malt sweetness, hints of caramel and milk chocolate most obvious. 


Taste: Clove and banana with some spice lead the way; also yeasty character gets some ground. Dry apples, light sour. Medium sweet middle, mostly grain/wheat - light caramel sweetness doesnt come out until in the aftertaste. Good balance of clove, banana and pepper play in the after - wouldnt expect anything different from Weinhenstephan. Some light noble hops at the end too. 


Mouthfeel: Light crisp start, this lively carbonation suits it well. Smooth and creamy medium light heavy body.

Fat scrumptious head of beige foam that fell slowly and leisurely to a ring and cap and then to a light layer on top. Handsome and stately in the glass. 

Nose is fantastic. Wheat, deep ripe banana, soft malt with a light caramel. Bread, nutty and some apple to give it a crisp tartness with the crisp and dry smelling wheat. Spices are clove and nutmeg, cinnamon and light allspice. Theres a tart aspect to the nose and its complex but not enormously complex. 

Taste is smooth, silky, soft malt. The fruits follow the nose all the way and the spices enhance your every taste of this well rounded body. Carbonation is ample but soft. The apple and the dry wheat give it a crisp flavor, the banana and the nutty malt accentuate the grain. It finishes dry and lightly sweet. Refreshing and well turned out. Silky deep and vibrant in character. 

Vibrant is my favorite word to describe the malt character of a good hefe. Its a beer that lets its malt shine. This one flowed like silk and had plenty of bread to offer but nothing heavy. Sweet, round and creamy. The mouthfeel is supple and sensational. The sweetness lies delicately and just underneath every flavor quality giving it its dark character with the nuts and grain.

757,"2013-06-18",3.1,"Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a Weihenstephaner chalice.

In my chalice this dunkelweizen pours a translucent walnut brown color with a reddish tint.  A tan head has a nice original size and density before gently fading.  

The aroma is surprisingly strong on the yeast.  Clove, some banana, and a bit of dark fruit.  Maybe some caramel in the background.

Although I was expecting a burst of robust flavor from each sip, I was somewhat disappointed in the blandness of the Hefeweissbier Dunkel.  The requisite banana and clove notes are there, as they are in the regular Hefe, but they are almost muted by what should be the dunkel part.  The only thing is, there is not much in terms of caramel, toasted malts, or dark fruits to be found.  

The carbonation is vivacious as I was expecting, with a rather light body.  The beer wraps up pretty cleanly with no real aftertaste to speak of.

Overall I have to say this is the weakest Weihenstephaner offering I have had.  I have no issue with how it was brewed per se, but the combination of flavors (or lack thereof) make it tough to say I would want to have this again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

This beer is interesting, unlike any other wheat beer ive had. Its aroma was quite hop heavy and sweet, not citrus-y sweet, but, i dont know it seemed kind of banana like, My first sip (out of a beer flute, slightly cooled) confirmed this bananary quality. I quite enjoyed the hazy dark golden tones it had going for it though i found the head to be a bit out of control (whether this was because of the temperatures i am unsure) was surprised to find the beer quite mild in flavour, which works for it in a good light. Unlike most wheat beers Ive had it overlooked the distinct wheaty flavour and opted for a sweeter lighter one with the classic thickness of the dark variance, unfortunately the flavour is quite abrupt and didnt linger for too long. It was quite thick and creamy which i found very pleasant and satisfying. I would say as an overall that this is definately one kick ass beer. And one of the best german wheat beers ive had yet.

It has great color for a dunkel, like burnt caramel. Very nice creamy white head. The flavor is of roasted malt, through and through. Not sweet like some dunkels can be, and thats a compliment. It has the tiniest hint of a sour finish, but in a very pleasant way. It has a finish thats long enough to bring you back for more. Overall, this is what I want a dunkel to be- not sweet and cloying like a cheaply-made dunkel, and in fact a good bit sour. Very enjoyable and Id buy it again for sure.","Sandy Springs, Georgia, USA","cduncan14"

The beer is chestnut brown and very hazy. The head is off white to light tan colored, standing in at two inches thick, leaving ample lacing in its wake.

The aroma is the same banana, clove, ester, wheat smell you get from the Hefeweizen, but with additional notes, of sweet breads (banana nut bread?)

Slightly sweeter than the hefeweizen. This is a delicious beer, and deserving of its #1 spot on the Top Beers - Dunkelweizen list. Full of flavor, well balanced and easy to drink. Banana, malt, yeast, bread flavors mingle beautifully.

The feel is creamy and smooth, with appropriate carbonation.

Overall, a shining example of the style. Well worth trying.

The aroma is of toasted bread and burnt vanilla smells in a heady mix which also has hops and yeast esters trying to vie for attention.

The taste is all vanilla and baked bananas. Not as sweet as my discription may imply. This has hidden flavours too, you have to search for them.
Apples and Pears, non-sour citrus fruits as well.

Not as thick as I anticipated, but not watery either. The flavours stay in the mouth and dont fade to anything nasty, like some beers can.

An outstanding beverage and one the I insist you look out for and try, this was a steal at only £2.25 for the bottle; if only it was more readily available in my area. I dont think it is just quite as good as the original hefeweizen offering from Weihenstephaner but it is an excellent change and the flavours all work well together. Get a bottle if you can.

757,"2011-10-29",4.3,"Meglepően sötét, vöröses mélynarancs színű folyadék, mesebeli, szinte virágos, mézes, propoliszos fullasztó élesztőillattal, amilyet csak Bajorországban tudnak előállítani, vagy legalábbis én még máshol nem találkoztam effélével. A habja olyan, amilyennek lennie kell, grandiózus, kenyérbélszerű, tartós.

Hihetetlenül finom, apró bubikkal pezsgő teste van, megtölti a szádat és komplex kavargó érzéseket kelt. Nehéz pontosan megmondani, mi történik, de az biztos, hogy mindenekelőtt az üde búzaaroma és karamellesség játszadozik egymással.

A kavargás a fő jellegzetessége, kaleidoszkópszerűen keringenek benne a törékeny ízek, és végül ebből a játékból alakul ki a sör egészen megnyugtatóan kerek íze, melyet mintha némi sósság vagy umami is kisegítene, távolról a főtt zöldségek (karalábé, zeller) ízével kiegészülve. Határozottan van benne valami húslevesszerű. A komló itt egyértelműen nem főszereplő, max masiniszta, de jól öltözött, tiszta, és udvarias akár a Savoy londínere.

Eleinte azért is nehéz kiismerni a Weihenstephaner Hefedunkelt, mert nagyon törékeny, finom teste van, a végsőkig kicsiszolt és filigrán, de később, ahogy megül, íze robusztusabb lesz, szétterül, olajosabb, néhol borosabb lesz. Majd végül előtörnek belőle a megnevezhetetlen trópusi gyümölcsök, melyek a nyíltkádas főerjesztés hiszterikus napjaiban költöznek a becsületes maláta közé.
Az utóíze elegánsan kesernyés, leheletnyit csípős, élesztős. Ha hihetünk az előző Weihenstephan kóstolásomnak, akkor ez a barna búza eonokkal izgalmasabb a sima weiss-társánál.","HUNGARY","tonycaviar"
757,"2011-10-28",4.2,"Aroma is a lovely, resounding banana, with a subtle citrus in the back. Also, yeast compliments this and makes that yogurty aroma that I associate with wheat beers. Taste is lovely, but the main feature is how this beer hugs that palate. Ive not yet had a beer sit so nicely on my tongue, and still get its flavours across. Taste wise theres the banana coming through, and the yeast, but almost a chocolate note in the back, along with the slightly more roasted malts, Whether it is chocolate or not Im not sure, maybe its more of a textural thing Im getting. Very light, but noticeable hop at the very end to finish with a floral undertone.

757,"2011-07-31",4.3,"My Bottom Line :  
Complex and quenching, ripe with apricot fruitiness, toasted wheat malts and earthy hops, this is a fascinating Dunkel Weizen. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A healthy head of foam lingers all the way down the pint glass atop the cloudy amber-brown. 
-Light caramel coats the dark bread impressions. 
-A touch of clove phenols and banana esters are here, obviously, but there is so much more going on. This is so far from being linear like most North American Dunkel Weizens. 
-The body is fluffy and angel-cake-like. At once rich and light.
-All flavors are perfectly integrated into one another.

757,"2011-07-02",3.9,"500ml bottle - Pours hazy chestnut with a huge foamy off-white head. Beautiful. If I closed my eyes and smelled this, Id guess it was a standard hefe. Tons of banana and clove, and very crisp and light. nothing dark about it. The difference comes through on the taste more. Theres still heavy spicing and a bit of bubble gum fruitiness, but its hidden under a layer of dry, bready malt. Some mineral aspects to it, too, which makes most of the finish pretty abrupt. There is some light fruitiness in the long finish though. Overcarbonated, but Ive come to expect that of some of the German wheat beers.

757,"2011-03-11",3.8,"Poured into a large lager glass. Appearance is a hazy dark copper color with an impressive, thick, head of beige foam resting lazily on the top of the beer. Aroma is an interesting surprise. Never having had this style before, I didnt know what to really expect. I was greeted with an exciting green apple scent, some sweet chocolate malts, and perhaps some roasted nuts and wood. With such wonderful scents filling my nostrils, I couldnt wait to have the first sip so, alas, this great smelling beer has graced my tongue; I didnt get the funky taste I was hoping for though. Not to say this isnt a wonderful beer, but I was hoping for something sour after my initial sniffing. The taste I did get was a light, chocolate, some bread, a touch of vanilla, and a dash of woody notes. The finish is a culmination of all of these flavors joining together in a slowly fading finish.

Showed a hazy chestnut brown with a superfrothy off-white coloured head, which remains at last finger thick on the brews top.
Its tart smell brings fermented bananas and chocolate in the nose.

Ar: A bit of spice (clove, cinnamon) and a bit of banana, but the nose is somewhat off; not skunky but almost a bit like leftover cabbage cooking water.  Odd, perhaps this particular bottle is a bit past its prime?

The carbonation makes it refreshing to drink and the cashew, brown sugar, and light fruit flavors all become more pronounced as it warms up to room temp.

A bit dryer and nutty than the average Dunkelweizen.  Fluffy body and Belgian-style lively.  I felt the yeast was taking too much room for this style of beer.  I wouldnt drink 4 pints of it.

757,"2010-03-15",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 18, 2010 Bottle.

A - Cloudy chestnut brown and caramel color. Huge, thick, foamy, sticky, creamy off-white head (enough adjectives? the head really is impressive). Really good retention as well.

S - Lots of clove, overly-ripe banana, and caramel, molasses and brown sugar. Reminds me of a french toast made with banana bread.

T - Similar to the smell. A lot like a banana bread french toast (which is delicious by the way) with a touch of maple syrup. Good amount of banana, as well as toffee, caramel, brown sugar/molasses, and a touch of maple syrup. Good amount of clove, also a good amount of other spice (cinnamon and nutmeg mostly). Malted wheat also present along with the sweet malts, and they make up the backbone.

M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Smooth and a touch sticky.

D - Goes down very well, and the favor is great. Just the right strength, not overpowering on the palate. Makes me want to keep coming back for more.

Notes: Really nice beer. Good mix of classical Hefewizen flavors and sweet dark flavors. Ill mention it for one more time, really reminiscent of a banana bread french toast. A touch sweet but a really enjoyable beer. Im not sure if it is better than the original Hefewizen, rather it is just a different beer that I would crave at a different time for different reasons.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Dry somewhat spicy too, maybe clove.  Not overpowering.  Nice thick mouthfeel, almost like drinking thick syrup.  Very thick, some flavor, but not very much.  Almost a chemical taste to it, plastic or something.  Warming up a bit more, more dark fruit like grape, raisin.  Not very complex a flavor, light.

757,"2010-02-13",4.4,"Beautiful cloudy brown body with a creamy, marshmallow-like beige head. I was able to see the bubbles rising rapidly to the top of the glass. The head retention was okay.

The aroma is full of banana, spices (cinnamon and clove), some caramel and/or toffee, a touch of chocolate, and yeast. Smells like a perfect dark wheat beer. You might also be able to pick up some dark fruit notes.

The taste is quite complex for a relatively light-bodied beer. Starts out with a sweet bready taste, with a strong banana suggestion, a fair amount of spices, and a touch of dark fruit (prunes and dates). Then comes the yeastiness, with a slight tartness to it. The finish is a little dry and bready, with some lingering banana notes. Everything youd expect in a dunkel weizen is there.

Extremely pleasant on the palate! Light-to-medium body. Velvety smooth, with a bready sweetness, and a touch of tartness.

757,"2009-10-23",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 14, 2010 500mL bottle from the LCBO. This beer justifies the existence of this style to me. Poured a muddy reddish brown with a large beige head. Super active carbonation. The aroma is great, straight up bubblegum, minor clove and wheat malts, with some musty yeast as well. The flavour starts out with a sweet malt element that flips quickly into a sort of salty bite that somehow works, with very minor spice, clove, and a yeasty finish. Nice sweet wheaty malt aftertaste. I did not generally like Dunkelweiss until I tried this example, and now I can understand why people bother brewing it.

757,"2009-07-13",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2010 Without looking or knowledge that Id reviewed this, here is the latest:
Clear, light brown brew as there was hardly any sediment at the bottom of my bottle to pour in. Off white cap was creamy and large on the pour. Fizzled down to a cover with solid, consistent 360 degree lacing. Nose says: banana, chocolate powder and stop picking me with a melon baller. Yum! Simple and succulent. Light fruit and my super nose is trying to tell me about a hint of smoke but I call him a dirty lying whore. Light vanilla as well. Sometimes complexity can be overrated. Nice very light hop can be tasted early on, banana, dull chocolate and weak yeast works well. Its a good blend of simplicity just like the aroma. Light richness and light spice linger. A bit dry yet soft feel makes happiness. Old review was 8484 16. mew review is dead on.

Vegas 08 trip
Poured out a modest light bubbly tan head, hazy caramel brew (dead on weizen look) - wasnt totally sure what I was gonna see with this as its my first D-W but I think that the colour of this beer is excellent. Minimal lacing. Subdued aromas of bananas, cloves and vanilla extract (weakest of the three scents) and plums. The taste is pretty good and I wish I had a keg of this as it goes down waaaay to easy. Solid flavour that does not back down but never ever gets close to actually being strong as this is one soft beer. Bananas, wheat, toasty malts, cloves, pepper and a touch of orange.

757,"2008-09-16",3.6,"<b>09-Apr-08</b> <i>(500-ml bottle: BevMo in La Jolla, CA)</i> Muddy amber-brown in color, it’s nearly impossible to see through the beer.  It’s topped by two inches of lively heading, though I admit I wasn’t especially careful with the pour.  The nose is fruity and tart, lots of cloves and a hint of banana, but not really all the wheaty, so this smells different than the Dunkelweizens I’ve had, and I appreciate the departure.  In the flavor, too, there is less emphasis on the bready wheats, and more focus on mild banana, prominent clove and spice, and a moderately chocolaty maltiness.  Medium-bodied, cleaner and less heavy on the palate than some others, I find this is an easy-drinking but delicious Dunkelweizen.  Whereas most of these beers have had fizzy heads that dissipated rapidly, the long-lasting head here retains a quarter-inch layer atop the beer for most of the session.

757,"2008-03-01",4.0,"A careful pour produces a voluminous, four-finger thick, lightly cocoa tinged, tan colored head that only laves a touch of lacing on the sides of my glass.  The beer is a earthy, dark plum color, but shows a lightly hazed, lightish cranberry hue when held up to the light.  When held up to the light you also get a good sight of the seething mass of bubbles that are packed into this brew.  Quite an appetizing aroma, it is a melange of banana, caramelized bread crust, a touch of sweet plum, crushed grain, some smooth phenolic clove notes and a light peppery spice character that is just barely noticeable underneath the surface.  The Dunkel part of the malt bill adds a bit more, slightly rich, fruitiness to the aroma than one would find in a pale version.  It also accentuates aromas of toasty grain and fresh baked, whole-grain bread crust.

The carbonation keeps this fairly light and definitely adds a light frothy texture to this brew.  Very lightly sweet, but it does have a richness of malt character to it that pale Hefeweizens do not have.  Soft fruit flavors of ripe plums seem to be a bit more noticeable up front than either of the signature banana or clove notes.  Both are here though with the banana playing a subtle flavor role up front and in the middle, while the clove flavors add a spicy finish to this brew where it plays a pretty significant role.  Coupled with the clove in the finish is a nice, wheat-beer  tartness.  As the beer warms up a bit, the clove flavors begin to stretch into the front parts of each sip.  The texture of this beer really has a nice, soft, velvety character to it; it coats the mouth, but softly as this is a very quaffable brew.  Melanoids and caramelized notes characterize the malt / grain character up front, while a bit of dusty grain character with just a kiss of toast graces the palate in the middle.  At times a spicy, pepper-like character inserts itself onto the palate, it is quite nice and provides a sort of palate cleansing.

This is just a very nice example of a Dunkel Weizen.  The caramelized, slightly toastier malt adds an interesting dimension to the traditional Hefeweizen character.  This is a beer I would be quite happy to drink a few liters of.

I ordered a bottle of this at Old Chicago.  It poured a hazy brown color with plenty of small bubbles.  I raised the glass to my mouth and was hit with a sweet dough-like smell that I had never experienced before.  I smelled it again and couldnt believe how different this beer was from the big-name American beers I was used to drinking.  Then I took a drink and immediatly craved more.  I never thought a beer could taste this good!  The beer seemed to hug my tounge as I drank it.  I was sad when that beer was gone, but even more sad when I found out that our local Old Chicago was no longer going to be carrying it.  Luckily I have since found a local specialty beer store that was willing to order some for me.  I love this beer!","Des Moines, Iowa, USA","lucke13"

757,"2008-01-17",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2008 This is very nice, smooth and tasty, being a less crisp, somewhat caramelly version of their Hefeweissbier, although I prefer the latter.  This is hazy, somewhat dark brown amber with a huge off-white head that lasts a long time but leaves almost no lacing.  The aroma is like a hefeweizen but softer, with hints of toffee and more toasty grain or even a hint of nuts along with the wheat/banana/bubblegum elements, while the bubblegum in particular is more muted and barely noticeable (compared to their light hefeweissbier, where the bubblegum is quite strong).  The taste is similar, being a softer, less crisp version of the lighter beer, with less bubblegum, less bitternes, and a definite light caramel taste and smoothness.

757,"2007-11-27",3.8,"Draught weizen at Deep Ellum on 11/3/07Prominent, foamy, beige head tops a cloudy magenta-maroon body.  Strong retention and lacing speak to both the quality of brewing and the cleanliness of Deep Ellums draught lines.Soft and fruity, with warm cherry, date and raisin notes mixing with caramel malts to give an easygoing aroma.  Banana and clove do not bludgeon, but add a tell-tale signature to the finish, leaving spicy hops to add zestiness and dry some of the sweetness.  Bubble gum is fairly strong here, and the lack of roast in this dunkelweizen helps push it to the forefront, for better or worse.  It comes off a little sugary/bubble gummy, then, but still impresses with the cleanliness and mild, comforting notes.  No alcohol or flaws, medium to medium-high strength of aroma.Very soft and chewy palate immediately evokes wheat, caramel sugars and fluffy, yet tight carbonation.  Dates figs cast a more poignant note in the background, while up front sweet, caramel pecan flavors mix with vanilla-dusted bananas and medium dry toffee.  The bubble gum is not noticed as singularly in the flavor, but certainly does add to the overall sweetness when taken with the caramel and toffee-like malt notes.  I wont say the 23oz glass went down with extreme ease, but it certainly wasnt a challenge to drink it either.  Soft, wheat and yeast-blunted flavors provide the mild nature to the beer and improve drinkability, which could be further improved with less sweetness.  Certainly not unbalanced, though.  Flawless, with no alcohol or fusels noticed.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Smell; full of bananas and cloves. Theres also a bit of a grassy smell, along with a nice caramel sweetness.

Taste; the cloves and bananas have a strong presence, but not to powerful. It has a yeasty bread dough flavor, as well as a bit of earthiness, and finishes with a good malty sweetness. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, and goes down really nicely.

757,"2006-11-22",3.3,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2006 16.9 oz. bottle. The beer has that classic, appetizing, zesty, lemony, gingery, hefeweizen aroma. This is my first non-fruit hefeweizen in a few months, and I very much welcome the return of that great scent. The color is a hazy gold-tinged light-to-medium brown. The color is lighter than the ""dark"" designation might suggest. The beer pours with a large amount of head, as is typical to the style. It tastes just as it smells, which is a good thing, but whereas the aroma is powerful, the flavor is disappointingly subdued. The texture is smooth and the carbonation is fizzy, but in a typical, almost boring, sort of way. Overall, this is a pretty good beer, but it definitely could afford a significant boost in the quantity of its tasty flavor.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

757,"2006-02-03",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 29, 2007 Pours a dark old penny color w/ a full, creamy froth. Head retention sticks like a stubbrn mule. Aromas of musty yet  brisk, dried dark fruits. Medium nectar with very litte residual effers. A little watery on the palate actually. Slightly medicinal malt flavors to include coffee, bakers cocoa, plum, bitters, and fruit cake spice. After a bit the spicey character really opens up and jumps out at you like the Joker and cackles relentlessly in your face. Possesses a mild fruity sweetness. The finish is bittered ever so slightly and has a lingering spicey malt essence.  Overall: this is a more delicate specimen w/ defined style characteristics.  Well balanced yet a little thin at times. A good brew none the less.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"

A large frothy head that lasted a while, particularly due to the endless streams of bubbles speeding their way to the top of the glass. The aroma was of creamy bananas and some cloves, but also a bit of citrus. On tasting the toffee notes became more evident as well. There was a decent balance in the flavour that was leaning towards the dry and bitter end of the spectrum, but the excessive carbonation, a thin body and metallic feel created a disappointing palate and finish. 6 4 7 2 10 2.9 Re-rate: Much better conditioned bottle this time around.

757,"2005-08-18",2.6,"Muddy dirty brown, off-white head is fed over and over again by the extremely effervescent body. Highly phenolic nose. Not really banana accented nor clovey hence quite atypical. It is rather malty and fairly roasty on the other hand, almost burnt bread toastiness. Understated wheat doesnt contribute much, not really refreshing at all as much as the carbonation is agressive and bites the tongue savagely. Clean nature, fruity around the edges. Remotely dry nuttiness, faint leafy hops. I guess this is tolerable as a dunkelweizen, but this brings no joy and is a rather plain drink globally.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Poured into a Weihenstephaner Weiss glass very slowly as I had trouble controlling the massive gassed-up head that spewed from the bottle. Once under control the aroma kicked in. Very fresh and slightly acidic citric hop and sour-dough wheat scents dominated, with hints of lemon & orange peel, milk chocolate and cinnamon. The body a chestnut amber, not as brown as I had expected, with high carbonation keeping the thick off-white head safely in the glass. Lighter than expected body, low yeasty biscuit notes little hints of clove and cinnamon mid-palate. Fruity highlights of lemons, oranges and unripened bananas ( Became sour and slightly lactic half way down ). Short, pleasant aftertaste and quite refreshing.

Pours a lovely, billowy autumnal hazy orange. This beer smells like autumn. Notes of bourbon and vanilla, coupled with the usual sourness of the wheat. and perhaps thats what I dont like about this one it is too complex in a sweet way rather than in a sour way. I used to crave Dunkelweizens like i was pregnant...except you cant drink when youve got a kid in your womb...Flavors are excellent if not subdued.

757,"2003-12-18",3.4,"Body poured dark brown with a light, ample head.  The aroma was complex.  Hints of fruit and caramel and coffee and such.  Kept trying unsuccessfully to pinpoint it.  Good flavor.  Weihenstephaner produces some good brews.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
757,"2003-12-16",4.0,"Copper hue with good off-white head and good lace. The aroma hints of banana, spice and citrus (hefe) caramel, roasted malt, and dusty yeast esters (dunkel). The taste starts malty sweet but the weizen character quickly adds notes of citrus and banana and that twangy yeast quality I love in the standard hefe. The finish has a strange (but good) miz of spice and smoke that is a clear indicator of the ""blends"" of the two styles. I like this because it is unique and offers a wide variety of flavors, complex and very drinkable.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Very balanced, smooth finish to it as well.","","Cobra"
757,"2003-09-17",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2003 Wow, this was a really tasty hef. I wonder why the darker hefes haven't made their way into craft breweries more, a good North American micro's rendition of this might be spectacular. Grains take front seat in this beer, prividing a solid flavor for the sweet malt to skate around on. The mouthfeel here was excellent, with an almost dry feeling across the tongue from the grains and a coating of malt over the rest of the mouth. Some esters floating around in there but none as clear as the grains.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"

Aromas of clove, pepper and the faintest touch of banana - great. Lighter-bodied, drier and more highly carbonated than their Hefeweizen (which is good).

757,"2003-07-28",4.1,"This is swank beer. Not up to Aventinus standards, but damn near close (yes I realize they are different styles). Just a tad darker than Schneider Weiss -- cloudy tarnished copper. Big meringue head, the kind where bubble pop and a leave a permanent pit. The aroma, in addition to some of the typical aromas had this aroma I associate with stilton cheese. It's not a cheesiness, but that aroma that I can't really describe but think of as a smokey earthiness. Great hefe flavors, a bit milder than I prefer (I'm a Schneider Weiss aficionado) but this is made up by the darker malt flavors. A bit like caramel and bananas. Great, elegant beer.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

Front is thinner than expected with some sweetness and malt, top is very light, finish is dry. I believe the dunkelweiss style has something to offer, but this attempt falls short. Still very good tasting weiss, but for a so called ""dark hefeweiss"" this beer does not say much for the style.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","MadMan"
757,"2003-06-24",4.2,"Color is what I compare to the river water of the Mississippi on a good day. It looks like what its suppose to for a dark hefe, one ugly ass murky brown. The top was super fluffy and tall, nearly two inches of fluffy frothyness, liked whipped coffee cream, crumbles slowly to a fine small head that never leaves. Lace is everywhere, some sticks, some drips, mostly patches with some strings.
Smell is quite simple yet very nice, soft and light airy lemon, some maltness, a bit musty and a touch of banana and spice.
Taste is a nice mellow lemon flavor, easy tartness, balanced nicely with darker malts and wheat, a bit of breadish dryness, touch of banana and spice in there, smooth the entire gulp. Nice open and mellow medium body feel, mostly midway action then thins out nicely in the finish leading it to be drinkable beyond comprehension.

Smooth, dry, rather plain finish.  OK, but I'm not going to cry that I can't get it in VT.

Beautiful.  But not much intensity or complexity in aroma or flavor.  Not bad ... some malt, some sweetness, some hops, but not a lot of anything.  It tries ... some spice, pepper, cloves, banana.

Instead of the usual light chocolatey flavours you get in a lot of dunkelweizens, this one has a lot of savoury flavours. There's a lot of salty, fishy flavours, as well as some sourness, and a slight metallic edge.

Some of the typical hefe yeast character, but downplayed.  I didnt really care for this beer as dunkel.  Slap a diferent label on it, however, and there is something here to be appreciated.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","Inveigler"
757,"2002-08-21",3.9,"Great dense white foamy head, great aroma, fuirt and spice delight my nostils.Grainy flavor, with banaa and clove, quite spicy..it went great with Guacachips and smoked peach salsa.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","dirtymike"
757,"2002-08-12",3.7,"Pretty good dunkel.  Very opaque brown color with a light tannish head.  Bananas, cloves and a nice lightly roasted malt notes.  Taste and mouthfeel is typical for a dunkel weissbier (lighter in body than they look) also some hints of chocolate are revealed.  This is a very respectable beer, not one Id go for frequently, but when the craving for a dunkel hits, there are certainly worse choices.","Michigan, USA","softale"
757,"2002-08-12",4.1,"A very nice, well-rounded Weisse. Nice dark amber color, good nose, body, and banana finish. Overall impression: Good!","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Miggl"
757,"2002-08-01",2.9,"Mild hefe aroma with caramelized syrup/malt backdrop.  Pithy, grainy, cream-colored head, which holds steady at about 1 cm.  Moderately cloudy, good bottle.  Clean mild hefe with some molasses and pepper.  Thin, and loses carbonation rapidly.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"
757,"2002-07-29",3.9,"Dark malts and banana, wheat and yeast in the nose. Cloudy, dark chocolate brown with off-white foamy head. Light-medium carb on medium-thick body. Banana and clove taste with dark malts and yeast. A bit of hops. Peppery wheat after. A good dark wheat beer.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"
757,"2002-07-27",3.2,"The nose is ultra-fine here. The taste falls down a bit. A good bit of clove, quit thin in the palate, not very much more. Not bad, just not what I hoped for.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"

757,"2002-07-01",3.2,"Buttery aroma, lightly yeasty.  Rather thin, watery texture.  Weird sort of maple-y, waffle cone flavor going on.  Most wheat character is masked.  Could use some more spice/clove to balance the sweetness.  Fransiskaners dunkel boots this one in the arse, methinks.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
757,"2002-05-24",3.2,"Tastes just a smidge like a tripel or bock.  Very odd taste for a german wheat.  Otherwise, a pretty dark, medium-bodied dunkel.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
757,"2002-05-20",3.7,"unfiltered medium bodied, thick creamy head, great yeast flavor.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MaxPower"
757,"2002-05-06",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 2, 2003 Yet another great german brew. A really light flavor, which is great, yet it still has a full body to it. Near perfect, but a bit too much on the carbonation.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"
757,"2002-05-05",4.3,"Impressive.  The appearance is a lovely dark unfiltered gold, which forms layers in the glass.  The head is huge and creamy.  The aroma is a lovely, sour-yeast smell.  It tastes faintly of almost-ripe fruit -- sour, but not unpleasant.  The flavor lasts from the start to a very long finish that ends in a surprising spiciness, like alspice.","Washington DC, USA","Kathy"
757,"2002-05-03",2.8,"Unfiltered amber in color, with nice head.  Mild and sweet wheat aroma, with hint of banana.  On taste, the sweetness is subdued, the maltiness comes out, and some sourness creeps in.  No bitterness to speak of.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
757,"2002-05-01",3.4,"Re-Rate 05/01/02: Clear light brown in color, generous beige head and decent lace. Nose is a bit yeasty, malt, earthy as I like to say. Front is malt, sweet, the top light, the finish is lightly acidic, lightly hopped, somewhat dry, not the best, but not the worst.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
757,"2002-03-19",3.2,"Excellent pour and beautiful head.  Looks can be deceiving.  Had an unpleasant candy like flavor.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Cruddler"
757,"2002-03-16",4.4,"Big grainy flavor, sort of nutty/fruity bread thing. Typical low hops for the style. Good dunkelweizen color, i.e. much like cloudy Newcastle. Very pleasant indeed.","Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, USA","Admiral"
757,"2002-03-15",3.3,"UPDATED: MAY 16, 2012 Bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly lasting. Body is hazy light brown, bottle conditioned. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain, caramel), lightly to moderately yeasty (cobwebs), with light notes of gum, raisin, clove. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Ok, but nothing special. It honestly seems diluted.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

757,"2002-02-11",3.7,"deep tea color, like seasoned copper cookware; bottle conditioned hazy. fabulous lingering lather you could shave with.  aroma is of apple peels soaking in a yeast compote. maybe like what an applesauce factory smells like. great, brisk full-bodied palate and pleasant sweetness; the bavarians drink it for breakfast. perhaps ill try it before the morning commute tomorrow and see if it engenders in me a more affable demeanor toward my fellow motorists, the ones that tailgate, i mean...","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"

757,"2001-07-22",4.0,"Nice copper color, great head when first poured. A bit too fizzy at first but that passed and the beer became very smooth. Tastes alot like its hefeweisse cousin, but slightly maltier and with caramel and better fruitiness. Some caramel, candy apple, and banana flavors hiding in there. Slightly creamy, lackluster finish.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"
757,"2001-07-18",3.9,"I was reminded of a candy apple, both by the taste and aroma.  Hints of toasted coconut were nice and exciting, and overall this beer had a nice roasty flavor.  However, the carbonation seemed about three levels higher than it should have been.  As time passed, it did seem to become smoother, and developed a dominant banana taste.  Deep, cloudy brown color with a white head, which remained for the duration of the drink (albeit quite thin by the end). Simply put: very tasty, too bubbly...","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
