1647,"2017-04-30",4.3,"330 ml bottle into pint glass, best before 10/28/2017. Pours crystal clear nearly opaque dark brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, toasted dark bread, herbal, floral, and grass; with lighter notes of vanilla, molasses, licorice, dark fruit, smoke, char, nuttiness, pepper, yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of roast/bready malt and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, toasted dark bread, herbal, floral, and grass; with lighter notes of vanilla, molasses, licorice, dark fruit, smoke, char, nuttiness, pepper, yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate roast/char and herbal/spicy hop bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, toasted dark bread, nuttiness, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, smoke, char, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready malt and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; with an awesome roast/hop bitter/sweet balance; and zero acrid/astringent roast/hop flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from roast/hop bitterness, increasing through the glass. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/silky/bready, and fairly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 6%. Overall this is an incredible dry stout! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready malt and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the modestly bitter/drying finish. Very rich and complex roasted barley flavors; with complementing/balancing earthy hops and yeast in the background. A highly enjoyable offering, and best Ive had in the style!","Michigan, USA","superspak"

To be honest, I didnt have high expectations here - but it was actually all right. Roasted malts give a dry cacao and coffee character on the front, with a hint of vanilla and nuttiness on the way to a slightly ashy, pleasantly dry finish. I wouldnt say no to another. Sláinte mhaith! (14/20)

1647,"2016-03-01",3.9,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a nearly pitch black color with a one finger head of brown colored foam. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a ton of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the brew is big of a roasted malt smell mixed with hints of vanilla and a moderate coffee smell. Along with these aromas comes notes of a bit of a burnt aroma as well as some dark chocolate smells.
 Taste  The taste begins with a nice drier roasted taste mixed with a decent showing of coffee. Quickly after the initial taste there is a light chocolate sweetness that comes to the tongue along with a tiny bit of vanilla. The chocolate loses sweetness as the taste moves on taking on a slightly more bitter taste. This is joined by some burnt flavors and char more toward the end, leaving one with a rather dark and toasty taste to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the brew is slightly thicker to average for a stout of 6 % abv. with a carbonation level that is on the slightly higher side. A little bit less carbonation would have been better for the nice roasty tastes of the brew, but with the decently thick body, the feel was still nice overall.
 Overall  I rather enjoyed this dry Irish stout. Roasty and toasty with some nice burnt flavors and aromas. Overall a pretty good stout.","","Darkmagus82"

1647,"2015-04-19",3.9,"A really Irish dry stout, from a 50 cl bottle. My first beer from this well-known and very Irish brewery. Opaque black colour under a creamy, lacing, yellow beige, fairly stable head. Very pleasant and attractively perfumed aroma of cocoa, milk chocolate, cappuccino, leather, bayleaf, raisins, walnuts, mocha ice cream and even some sweet honey, candied figs, black coffee grounds, pipe tobacco, some faint cloves, coconut, vanilla and liquorice perhaps and a vague hint of balsamic vinegar for balance; no off-flavours whatsoever, even the dreaded iron effect is nowhere to be seen.  Dense taste with some candied sweetness but subduedly so, rather sparkling carbo (perhaps a bit much for this style), subtle sourish touch, supple and smooth mouthfeel but less creamy than expected from the style, a bit minerally, with a big, full dark maltiness in the middle, chocolatey, caramelly and nutty without any of these components dominating; finishes in a slightly ashy, coffee-like roasted bitterness, mouth-filling and lining the root of the tongue and the throat, very rounded and soft, with a leafy, somewhat spicy hop bitterness adding complexity; retronasal spiciness not unlike cloves and vanilla. In all: a very decent, robust and well-crafted dry stout, with a very inviting aroma; if Id have to find something to pick on, it would be the carbonation, which is a little bit too high for the style and distracts a bit from the creamy maltiness. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this very much, highly recommendable for maltheads.  In terms of style: indeed maybe a bit sweet for a dry stout, so I can go along with the classification as a plain stout without further specification.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Pitch black, huge fluffy frothy tan head. This was a really fresh bottle....smooth quite sweet chocolate, really good flavour this time, richer mouthfeel (medium bodied), certainly not thin at all and a really nice quite rich chocolate malt linger. Its the best Ive had....shame only 1 bottle left in the 10 euro Centra promotion......Going right up to 3.8

Bottle from Tesco, Longford [241113] 7/4/7/3/14
Aroma - Certainly getting more spicy hop in the aroma, softer malts, dark malts, will be fresher bottle this time 
Taste - soft dark malts, some of that spicy hop again, soft roast, some smooth chocolate malts, getting that soft treacle taste, nowhere near as much, would like more of the flavour, seems too understated
Palate - It really needs more body, the thinness of the beer lets it down, little over carbonated
Overall - This was better than last time (which was an older bottle), but a few tweaks could make it so much better. Sticking at 3.5.

Rate #1500
Black, thin ruby edges, frothy tan head, some lacing
Aroma - Rich dark malts, smooth dark chocolate, smooth mellow roast, deep malts, dab of treacle, rich quite complex aroma
Taste - Smooth deep roast, plain dark chocolate, quite sweet dark malts, some treacle, soft coffee (6.5)
Palate - Soft carb, medium body but a bit thin, smooth texture. Finish as main flavour, smooth rich dark malts, soft roasted malts, but treacle linger becomes cloying after a while
Overall - Initially, very impressed with the aroma. Taste initially was good, but the body was a tad thin, then on the finish a rich, heavier, quite cloying dark malt treacle linger comes through. Unfortunately, the taste after drinking a few sips didnt just quite much the excellent aroma and the cloying bit treacle flavour of the linger in the finish upset the balance of the beer.

1647,"2013-01-22",3.5,"Reviewed 1/15/2013. 11.2 oz bottle poured into a Samuel Smith pint glass.

A: Pours an ultra-dark brown color. Not perfectly opaque, mind you, but nearly. The head is a two finger heavy cream color with nice texturing, before it settles to one finger. Nice retention, too.

S: There are a ton of roasted malts and coffee. Some chocolate pops up, as well, perhaps even a hint of smoke. It also smells hoppy, even - maybe it IS generously hopped? I mean, that character of grapefruit peel prominent in Cascade hops is unmistakable here.

T: Again, theres a healthy flavor of grapefruity hops right there in the midtaste. It starts a bit chocolaty before the hops come in full (well, moderate) force. Finish is pure roasted barley. Generally, its mild in flavor; while this keeps the competing flavors in check, it makes it a bit dull. Luckily its not overly acidic as many well-hopped stouts/porters tend to be.

M: Hits the clean dryness typical of the style well, but the finish goes too far into being astringent. A bit insubstantial and undercarbonated in its feel; par for the course in many dry stouts. Great drinkability nonetheless.

O: And as I finish my glass, I notice the bottle cap somehow fell down in there. How the hell did that happen?! Oh well, this a fine offering. Not great, but fine.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"
