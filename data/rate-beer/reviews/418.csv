Its just a bad idea for beer, but that said, welcome to the best of the style.  Things start off with a stunning pour, complete with Guinness-esque reverse cascade(!)  She settled to a golden copper colour with an amazing thick foamy head.  Aroma heavy in flowers and hops, light caramel background.

Flavour is a nice balance of sweet malt and dry floral hops, the finish is lightly bitter.  Mouthfeel is watery and lightly astringent, somewhat flat.

418,"2005-06-04",5.0,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2005 Just finished 3 days of the ""Le Mondial de la bière 2005 Beer Fest"", montreals beer tasting festival. 3 long days of 4 oz glasses and WAY TO MUCH note taking. Cource some pages are just unreadable. For years now, being a huge fan of McAuslan St. Ambois, I have wanted to tase the cream ale, but very few pubs carry this one around montreal, its much more comon in toronto, wich is strange cuz its brewed here. 3 days ago I finaly got my wish. Verdict? ........ Best in show. I dont think Ive ever enjoyed a cream this much, and probably never will again.  On to the review.

Pours a glass of of white nitro-foam, perfectly circular cascade that rises perfectly to a golden, almost flat, sunshine ale with A THICK white head. I MEEN THICK! more of a foam than any sight of bubbles. And theres alot of it. I was shocked to see almost 3 inches of head after the rise.  Aroma is of bitter hops, hint of lemmon zest, vinilla. 
Mouth feel is smooth and silky, solid head stays all the way to the end, with heavy beautiful white laceing. 

{ Now, you gota understand, Im unlucky with bitters. I want so much bitter hop in a ale that it makes youre teeth hurt. Normaly when Ive been pointed to a ""AMASING BITTER"" it normaly looks and smells great, but it all falls apart with a mild, somtimes even floral, hop taste and I get sad. This one wasnt even labeled a bitter, but......}           

Taste if of bitter hop. Ibu around 35-40, mabby higher, Im not shure, Id had alot of beer by then. Smoth vinilla undernotes, touches of sweet bready malt, slight acit touch, and just a hint of yeast, an unfourtunite taste that seems to be in all cream ales. aftertaste is milky, air of some very dry hops, and a final wash of sweet. 

Final thought. Its good. Realy good, but not for every one. Lovers of sweet style beers will normaly chose a cream ale in a ""irish pub"" and this one would not satisfy. More of a bitter on nitro than youre normal sweet cream. 

One more day of the fest left. Im gona go have more of this today.

418,"2005-03-21",3.1,"On tap at the Jesters Court in Fredericton, NB. A bit surprised by this - I ordered it after seeing the St. Ambroise tap expecting the Stout. When it arrived I thought it was the Pale Ale. My waitress didnt seem to know. I took notes because I thought it was the first time I was having the Pale Ale on tap and it wasnt as good. Then I checked my receipt and it said Cream Ale. Which explains why it wasnt as good as the Pale Ale. But I digress. Deep golden amber colour with a frothy and creamy white head. Fruity and bready aroma. Bready and nutty malts predominate in the flavour with light fruit and a faint astringency in the finish. Medium bodied and smooth.","Halifax, Nova Scotia, CANADA","OKBeer"

418,"2005-03-11",3.2,"On draught at Dieu du Ciel, 3/6/05 with Muzzlehatch and tiggmtl.  Had this while waiting for our bottle of Péché Mortel to warm up.  Lightly hazy, apricot colored beer with a creamy white head, pretty much like it looks to the left.  Sweet and sour aroma of fruity ale yeast with a touch of sourness.  Flavor is again sweet and sour and it seems the yeast has a lot of influence on this beer, as it does with many cream ales.  But, I felt there wasnt enough else going on besides the light fruitiness from the ale yeast and the mildly crisp finish.  The damned head was annoying when I was trying to drink this, because I kept getting sips of the head, which was very tastless and foamy.  A little bit of dry caramel on the finish, dough and a light spiciness from the yeast, again.  A well made ale/lager.  Medium body, light wateriness at the end, pleasant carbonation and no alcohol.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
