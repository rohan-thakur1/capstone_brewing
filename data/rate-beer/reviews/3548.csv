3548,"2017-02-16",3.9,"Review is of 9 month old bottle

Pours an effervescent, cloudy, pale orange body. Head was white and short lived. Lacing isnt present. 

Smell is of a tart, slightly funky sour beer. Peach is lightly detected, straw/hay comes through as beer warms. Alcohol and hops arent detected. 

Taste immediately reminds me of kombucha. Slightly more sour than a lot of goses Ive had and also under salted. Peach is subtle, age might have something to do with that. This beer drinks incredibly smooth, yet is one of the higher abv goses ive had. 

Mouthfeel is light and very bubbly. head died soon after pouring. After taste was slightly puckering and carbonation tingled the tongue. 

Overall this was a good refreshing beer, not dead on the style, but enjoyable nonetheless. Believe this was a one time collaboration but Id buy again if given the chance.","Colorado, USA","Angelmonster"

3548,"2016-05-22",4.0,"Slightly cloudy bright straw yellow. Nose is peach flesh and light lacto funk. Taste is dry and lightly tart but fruit character presents well and balances. Flavor of ripe peach fleah, light wheat, mineral brininess, light lemon.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"
3548,"2016-05-18",4.0,"Tasted on 5/18/16 from a capped 375mL bottle, big thanks to Drews for sharing. Pours hazy muted yellow with a thin off white head that quickly disappears. The nose is pretty nice, fresh, juicy peach, some light savory spicy and herbal note, and a bit of earthy funk. The flavor is a bit less complex with still very nice juicy peach, less herbal and spicy, and a nicely salty note. The body is light with average carbonation and a long salty peach finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
3548,"2016-04-16",4.0,"Bottle courtesy of Ernesto. THANKS BRO. Aroma is pretty nice allthough goses are never much to sniff. Wheat, peach flesh, minerally, a bit funky. Taste is fantastic lactic tartness, mineral brineyness, and fruity sweet peaches blended perfectly. So drinkable but unfortunate that its such a limited beer. Would be a great 6-pack beer for sure.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
3548,"2016-04-15",4.0,"Sample at Collaboration Fest on 03/19/2016. The beer pours a clear pale golden color with a medium white head that burns away steadily to a film. Short strings of lacing. Aroma of oak, peaches and yeast. Light-bodied with a tart peachy character and notes of vinous oak, yeast and salt. The finish is tart with a salty peach aftertaste. Good beer all around.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
3548,"2016-04-04",4.1,"This beer was incredible, nice light peach flavors, very light gose flavors (salt) and some prairie style brett barrel aging.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
3548,"2016-04-03",4.0,"Small bottle from the brewery. This is a really clear gose. It settled out much more than I anticipated it would. Adding some of the contents at the very bottom of the bottle adds some cloudiness to the stark, clear, pale beer. The aroma is tart and oaky. Notes of muscadines back it up and thankfully the peach is very subtle. The palate is lively and light. Tart, fruity flavors are the centerpiece here with very pleasant oak notes for balance. Peach takes a backseat the whole time, and it works remarkably well. The finish gets funky in a good way. Excellent balance, wonderful combination of flavors. Spot on. Not sure Id call this a gose, but TRVE rarely does anything to style. And how much do we Americans really know about gose anyway?","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
3548,"2016-03-21",4.2,"Bottle. Golden pour with a touch of head. Light peach, sour stone fruit, tart fruit, salty aromas. Flavors are light, fruit, salty, peach, and tart tones.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"

3548,"2016-02-27",4.4,"Hazy golden with a thin spotty white head. Full peachy and earthy funky woody and wild nose. Very tart flavor loaded with peach flesh and juicy tartness, wild bacterial funk, nice salinity, a wee kiss of lemon zest, more peach juice tartness, and a dry wild yeast finish. Nice oak component throughout. Amazing.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
