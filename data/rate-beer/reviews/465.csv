465,"2015-06-24",4.0,"Pours a pitch black body, head is a tan color. Head retention is average and so is lacing. 

Smell is similar to cold brewed coffee. Notes of green coffee beans, oil, and fresh roasted, charred beans are prevalent. This smells like I stepped into a roastery. Slight notes of chocolate are present, hops and alcohol arent detected. 

Taste is big on coffee, acidic and slightly bitter. Getting some green herbaceous notes also. Biscuit malts are in the mix along with charred oak. Beer ends with a hint of chocolate, alcohol and hops are light. 

Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Unfortunately head died quickly, leaving something to be desired. Beer leaves a slight astringency in the aftertaste. 

Overall this was a very tasty coffee stout. In your face coffee flavors, no chocolate, caramel, vanilla/bourbon to mask it. A bit on the bitter spectrum of coffee but I can appreciate the raw flavors which is becoming rarer these days.","Colorado, USA","Angelmonster"

The mouth is very crisp and bubbly...too much so. For this style I prefer big and heavy, as this one is, but it needs to be smoother and a little creamier. Too much carbonation going on.

The chocolate really rips through everything else and is quite enjoyable. The taste is the same. There is some roast and coffee in the background, but there is a diverse array of chocolate types coming through. Milk, semi-sweet, and dark all seem to make their way into the mix.

465,"2011-02-07",3.3,"Poured into a snifter. Not quite sure how 6.8% ABV justifies the ""imperial"" designation, but whatever.

4.0 A: Light black in color if that makes any sense. Two fingers of frothy light brown head with not quite average retention and not really any lacing.

5.0 S: Awesome! I had no idea this was a coffee stout. Given that, Im bumping the appearance from a 3.5 to a 4 since I know how coffee does a number on head retention. Perfect coffee aroma - in my face, yet not overbearing. Instead of being balance with sweetness, theres more roastiness behind it in the form of roasted barley. As it warms, semi-sweet chocolate and rich caramel come out. Excellent.

3.5 T: Im loving the coffee in the taste, but its much more one dimensional than the nose. There just isnt enough of anything else to balance the powerful coffee. This is understandable given my qualms with the mouthfeel. The coffee covers up whatever else is in there.

2.5 M: Light body. With a thicker body this one would have been a lot better. The extra residual sugar would also have balanced out the coffee taste. Carbonation is a bit higher than Id like as well, but that is trivial compared to the body problem.

3.0 D: This beer could be fabulous if they upped the mouthfeel to a medium or thicker body. Although I love the strong coffee flavor, it needs some strong malts to supplement it.

465,"2011-01-08",4.4,"Bottle. Aroma very coffee-forward, super fresh coffee, fresh enough that maybe its just my imagination (I dont know how these things work), but I feel like Im picking up complexities of vanilla and tobacco, amongst others that Im too inept to name, from the coffee itself. If thats actually the case, thats some pretty bitchin coffee that retains its character so well in the beer. Flavor has a sweet roast and full (but not syrupy) body reminding me this is still beer. This must be a super fresh bottle, and it shows that they certainly know how to let the coffee shine, and sure picked some great coffee for the job.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"

The nose is of roasted dark chocolates, leaves the room smelling of a wonderful coffee house.

The finish closes with just a hint of roasted cherry.... and lots of coffee bean.  The body is smooth and semi-creamy, providing an easy quaff to the palate, and has a silky body that is excellent.

465,"2009-01-24",4.1,"Thanks to Santa Deuane for this one. Once I struggled to get the cork out of this bottle. 
I poured the bottle into a snifter and it produced a two finger coco colored Head that seems to be lasting. The body of course was a big black bomb 

The first thing I smelled was coffee and chocolate right from the pour. After a bit I got a little sour yeast but not much

Flavors are Coffee that is about it till it warms. Not as sweet as Oscura, but the mouthfeel reminded me of it. It is a little light in the feel for an Imperial but ample carbonation maybe to much. Back to the flavor a little sweetness from the malts keeps it from being to bitter. Then some dark chocolate comes out as it warms.

A good coffee stout I really think there should be a separate category for these. The number of them seems to be climbing. Good drinkability I finished the bomber with no problems at all. Took my time and enjoyed it on this cloudy afternoon thanks again Santa","Skowhegan, Maine, USA","Pastor"

Get the opportunity to sample my first from Pisgah thanks to Mikesgroove, thanks Mike! Valdez is a fine looking beer! Pours black with some transparency in the form of chestnut highlights at the bottom of the glass. The dirty tan head grew to a solid finger and a half on the pour and fell rather slowly to a skimming and respectable collar. The head leaves a patch or two of lacing here and there.

Wow! This beer is not really beer! Its cold coffee! Well, thats what the aroma suggests anyways. High quality fresh pressed coffee grabs the nose and never lets go. As I stir the head I still get massive coffee but a drop of cream and a pinch of sugar have been added. As the head dies back down its back to black coffee.

Big coffee in the flavor as well, obviously. I wonder if theres any beer in here? Although the coffee is everywhere it just foesnt live up to the intensity of the aroma, which would be near impossible to do. Thats just me being picky though. Finishes with a solid coffee bitterness that grows the more I drink. 

The mouthfeel is a little on the thin side but it actually increases the drinkability. I could be wrong but I think this was created to be a fairly drinkable coffee stout instead of a sippin brew. So keeping that in mind the mouthfeel fits well.

Like I said earlier the drinkability on this stout is up there pretty high. Its already going down far to fast.

I have no idea how the guys at Pisgah squeezed this much coffee into a stout but I commend them for it. Im already jittery and fiending for a cigarette! Id love to see this get bottled in four packs in the future, although that may be a long way off since they only do limited bombers now. Thanks again Mike for sending this tasty treat!

465,"2008-02-28",4.3,"Growler, via BA Deuane.  Pours a nice opaque black body with a creamy foamy brown one finger head that had nice retention for a 5 day old growler.  The nose is just spectacular, it smells like freshly ground and brewed dark roast coffee.  It actually smelled more like a quality cup of coffee than the actual cup of coffee they brought me with dessert at the restaurant I took it to.  Some roast and mocha as well, but mainly just coffee.  The flavor is super smooth well extracted coffee, no astringency at all from either the coffee or the malt.  Great depth and complexity to it, this really is all about the coffee, but theres a very solidly made Stout behind it.  Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a texture that is maybe a little less robust and less thick than Id like, but the carbonation is just right and its so easily drinkable.  The label on the growler says 7% ABV, but there was no trace of that at all.  Overall, I will admit that I am a huge sucker for coffee beers in general, there are a half dozen coffee beers in my personal Top 50, but this was just excellent any way you cut it.

Theres no pussy-footing about the coffee character in this, its big time, fresh, dark roasted coffee. Carbonation is spot on and the mouthfeel is a bit creamy and moderately dense. So much coffee flavor has been imparted here that all the nuances are intact along with a creamy, malty sweetness that adds a vanilla wafer and mocha dimension. This is seriously good stuff. Id say its heartier than their imperial stout, roastier for sure, and insanely drinkable.

The aroma smells like coffee. Not of coffee but just like coffee. The taste is the same all coffee with some burnt malt and a bit of sweetness. The lingering aftertaste was also of coffee. In fact I had to keep reminding my self this was beer. If you do not like coffee you will not like this but I thought it was great if a bit one dimensional.","Charlotte, USA","jobyone"
