1319,"2014-01-14",3.1,"Reviewed from notes. Consumed many times over the course of the past several months. The appearance has a dark brown almost black body with a one and half finger head that dies within a minute, lacing is spotty yet slides into the body. The smell is peat, caramel, tobacco all combined in a roasty smooth way. The taste is smooth sweet maltiness through the caramel, tobacco and peat begin to take a secondary sort of flavoring, peat aftertaste, somewhat dry finish. The palate is about a medium, but not sessionable, carbonation seems to be good for the style and for me. Overall, this is a good Scottish ale for me.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

1319,"2012-07-19",3.7,"can from SHIG pours reddish brown with a thin light tan head.  Aroma is awesome, big caramel malts, brown sugar and figgy pudding.  Flavor is sweet upfront with big brown sugar and lightly burnt malts but the finish is really nice with dry semi-roasted malts ending things nicely.  Good stuff.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","fata2683"
1319,"2012-07-16",4.0,"Thanks SHIG for the can and his patience while I get my act together.   Opaque garnet brown with a thick, creamy off white lace.  Looks great. Smells fantastic--light smoke, some peat, big dark caramel, roasted malt, light scotch.  Flavor is nice, light smoke, peat, dark fruits, caramel.  Great balance while maintaining a fairly low abv.   Best non-Midnight Sun Alaska beer Ive had to date.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
1319,"2012-05-13",3.5,"Hazy deep muddy brown coloured body with a very thick, soapy four centimetre tall light brown head that dies fairly quickly. Aroma of nuts, cardboard, malt, caramel, pears, apples and a bit of very light spicey notes. Medium-bodied; Assertive pear and apple flavour sweetness up front with a good dose of malt, caramel, toffee and a hint of light spices again. Aftertaste shows a tiny bit of hops, a little earth and a lot of caramel, nuts and alcohol warmth on the end. Overall, a decent scotch ale with some good fruity tastes but mostly malty and nutty with some good sugars at the end. I sampled this twelve ounce can purchased from La Bodega in Anchorage, Alaska on 23-June-2011 sampled at home in Washington on 12-May-2012.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

1319,"2011-12-01",3.9,"Can from my friend in Fairbanks.  Thanks, Ian! Light brown, frothy lightly dense head fades quickly to a film.  Deep red to brown and lightly hazy.  Nose is heavy but candy like dark caramels, nuts, toffee, smoke, and bread.  Flavor lends evident smoked malts, breads, and complex caramels. Sweetness is medium and bitterness is low.  Earthy malt flavors probably from the smoked malts? smooth and nice easy drinker.  Full body.  Im not usually a fan of this style but this one is really tasty.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","wnoble"

1319,"2011-10-17",3.5,"[Tap] Sampled at the brewery in early September. Pours a deep shade of brown with very little head. Molasses, sticky toffee and vague smoke are in the aroma. Taste is of dark brown sugar, earthy hops, smoked peat and mild dark fruits. Decent body, but I expected a richer beer based on the nose. Low carbonation levels. Not my favorite beer of the visit, but well made nevertheless.","Illinois, USA","troyc"

1319,"2009-06-25",3.6,"Draft at Humpys in Anchorage.  A slightly smoky brew, this is a pleasant representative of the Scottish style ... vaguely peaty, but not too much.  This would be a great drink by an Alaskan campfire during the shoulder season, skeeters be damned.  (#3565, 6/23/2009)","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"
1319,"2009-03-14",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 11, 2010 Growler from the Brewery. Clear dark brown with a very small off white head. The aroma is sweet bready malt, caramel and light smoke. The flavor is sweet with the taste of bread and caramel and very light acidic smokiness. Full bodied, mild carbonation and a smooth mouth feel. I had lost my taste for Scottish ales but I was surprised with this one.","Anchorage, Alaska, USA","savnac"
