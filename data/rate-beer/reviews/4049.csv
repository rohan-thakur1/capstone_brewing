The nose was dank, biscuity malt, with notes of grapefruit, pineapple, melon, and some greenery. Light to medium bodied, with good carbonation, the taste was somewhat similar, with hints of additional esters as orange & tropical fruit that livened and contributed more complexity to the flavor, and moderate, lingering, citrusy bitterness that was slightly mellowed by the malt creaminess. Tasty, and very drinkable.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

4049,"2016-06-06",3.9,"Bottle, undated, drunk 5/26/16.High clarity in this brilliant golden body with a firm white head atop.Dusty, citra-like notes add plentiful lemon while a strong herbal and pepper element is present. Soft, floral, easygoing and with light grain notes from the malts in the background. Very clean, exquisitely so, as Toppling Goliath bottled/canned products seem to be. Love the lack of resin/pine here.Very tight carbonation propels tons of lemon, dank, spicy notes and black pepper about the palate as a malty, very biscuity but dry body creates a perfect texture. The dryness almost goes a bit too far, especially in concert with the very dry hop characteristics, so Id almost say just a bit of sweetness or juiciness might perfect things. But Im not going to complain much about a fantastically executed, clean, very dry beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate pine, lighter dank hops, mild citrus, and lemon peel. It pours a dull golden-orange with a small white head that fades to a minimal film outlined by a thin ring. The flavor starts with moderate citrus with a hint of peach.

4049,"2016-04-01",4.6,"BOD 3/6/16. Pours an almost clear pale amber with a touch of haze. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

Rich very aromatic world class nose of citrus, with a good dose of tropical citrus. Orange and pineapple are the strongest components with light zest, mango and a touch of spruce underneath. As it warms, an earthy dank note develops.

Light full body that is quite smooth and finishes a bit creamy. Perfectly balanced world class carbonation level with a strong effervescent middle and a rollicking finely bubbled prickly finish.

The flavor profile is world class. It is hop flavor centered and has pitch perfect balance. While quite complex, excellent flavor separation occurs. The sharper flavors arrive first (zest, orange) than mellow into pineapple and mango in the middle. The middle brings a very low level of bitterness that is rind based, but has a light spruce note as well. A slightly grainy biscuit sweetness occurs mid-palate allowing the sweet tropicals to shine. As the finish approaches, a significant dank wave coats the tongue. The finish is a slow tasty dank fade of light tropical sweetness, zest and spruce. This lives up to the hype.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

4049,"2016-01-22",4.4,"Pours a completely clouded amber-orange color with one finger white head, revealing a good amount of spongy bubbles.

Tastes of a watermelon, biscuit malt blend, wrapped up by a herbal dankness. Orange and papaya both add to the watermelon, while enhancing the sweeter malt balance by introducing a lovely sweet ripeness. Hops produce a juicy lemon pulp quality, enriching the melon in a refreshing, truly enjoyable fashion. 

Drinks very soft with a pleasant, well dosed, lively carbonation during the finish. Not yet smooth, which works well for the malts, lending a pleasant sweetness to the hops, not getting beyond a balancing purpose. 

Brings a herbal bitterness to the palate from the very beginning, soothed by a wet grass dankness and white bread malts. After this initial hop punch, the taste fuses to a very harmonic flavor profile, featuring more and more exotic fruits among toffee sweet malts. The mouthfeel turns even softer after the beginning, smoothing the way for orange, papaya and crisp lemon, producing a fantastic juice quality among well accentuated malts. Finishes with sweet and refreshing watermelon among biscuits, together with a flowery dryness, accentuating the melon, revealing a fantastic flavor intensity. 

Grat beer, exhibiting a unique hop composition, while integrating a subtle malt sweetness beautifully. Watermelon gets depiced in this awesomely well, with exotic fruits pushing it to the limit. A slightly biting, herbal note develops a challenging synergy with the fruits, accentuated by citrus peel.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Pours a very hazy gold color with a big fluffy white head and decent lacing on the glass.

The aroma is lightly dank with a nice big fruity hop character. Not especially complex & even a touch sweet but on all accounts inviting. 

The flavor is a bit sweeter than your typical Toppling Goliath hoppy beer. That said its reasonably well balanced with a medium level of bitterness, and a big spicy and fruity hop flavor. Its got orange, some lime zest, and a bit of floral flavor. There is a very faint lingering astringency in the finish. 

Could be a winner with a few tweaks, Id love to see this refined and developed into a hop patrol beer.
