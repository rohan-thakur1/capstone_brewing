1605,"2014-03-15",3.4,"Pours out of the bottle in a clear watery-vanilla colour with smooth to medium body. Aroma of citrus and rice - nice. Taste of citrus, pineapple, mango, straw and flowers - very surprising. Flowery finish with some light acid hints. Nice one but not extraordinary.","Reutlingen, GERMANY","McTapps"
1605,"2014-01-12",3.5,"Pours crystal clear; the viscous body leaves nice legs behind. The nose includes a rather muted yet pleasant ginjoko; reminiscent of anise and bright fruit notes. While the anise notes resonate on the palate, pepperiness from the alcohol kicks in on the semi-sweet mid-palate; the faint acidity is subtly fresh. The finish is very clean; even at room temperature, the bitterness is very weak. When served chilled, it should be gone without a trace. The mouthfeel is viscous and the body nice and full. Recommended.","","Takemasta"
