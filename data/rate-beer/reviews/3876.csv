3876,"2017-03-25",4.5,"Data ważności:  01.03.2017 
 Kolor:  Ciemnożółty, mętny. 
 Piana:  Okazała, bieluteńka jak śnieg, złożona z drobnym pęcherzyków powietrza. Buduje wysoki kilkucentymetrowy kopiec. Opada powoli do sporego kożuszka. 
Na ściankach szkła umiarkowane zdobienia. 
 Zapach:  W aromacie cała wesoła gromadka owoców cytrusowych (ananas, grejpfrut, mandarynki).
Na przeciw nim stają białe owoce: białe winogrona, agrest.
Całość dopieszcza Mosaicowa nafta.
Pod spodem odrobina żywicy.
Aromat jest intensywny i ekstremalnie przyjemny. 
 Smak:  W smaku bardzo wytrawne, gigantycznie owocowe, ale nie tak soczyste jak GBG Beer Week.
Całe kosze białych owoców (grejpfrut, ananas, białe winogrona, agrest).
Wyczuwalne też lekkie nuty białego wina.
W oddali nuty żywicy i drzew iglastych. 
Piwo jest tak nieprawdopodobnie gładkie i lekkie w odbiorze. Nie sposób nawet tego pojąć.
Goryczka jest ta delikatna, krótka, znika przed kolejnym łykiem.
Tekstura zwarta, zbita, gęsta, oleista.

Spicy and complex on the palate, refreshing yet very complex in flavour. Citrus fruit, pine, tropical fruit combine eith the distinct grassy, herbal and earthy notes of Mosaic. The Malt is less pronounced but forms a light sweet base - all in all the beer is well balanced. Finishes rather long with a pine and herbal pronounced flavour. 
An amazing beer which showcases my favourite hops beautifully. Simply an amazing IPA.

Mango, pineapple, apricot, grapefruit and orange rind. Taste begins with a blast of mango and pineapple sweetness balanced with grapefruit and orange rind bitterness, for some bittersweet goodness. A dry and long bitter finish. Dry, medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, in my opinion, although not quite as good as GBG Beer Week 2016, this was another home run by Stigbergets.

Drinks light, crisp with a well accentuated sparkly carbonation, dryer than expected with a slightly warming, long lasting lemon finish.

Tastes of passion fruit sorbet, wrapped up by lime pulp, papaya and ripe blood oranges, establishing two things from the get go - an intriguing, sweeter fruitiness, and a prominent, crisp lemon bitterness. Lime prevails on the tongue till the very end, while the fruits get toned down onwards from the mid palate, replaced by toffee malts. Finishes clean and dry, with a big lime punch instead of the beers initial soft fruitiness, which lasts on the tongue for ages, wrestling down the malts successfully.

3876,"2016-11-24",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2016 (33 cl bottle this time from Kihoskh; Batch #542; BBD is 30.04.17) This is exactly the same batch as the one I got from Systembolaget a month earlier so it shall be interesting to see how this beer develops after another month in the bottle. My personal attempt at an NE IPA surprisingly grew more bitter over time (just like a grumpy old man perhaps) To make the comparison as fair and scientific as possible this one was also poured at fridge temperature into a Rochefort goblet. The result is a cloudy golden body with one finger of white head that recedes a bit leaving the same film and nice lace as with the previous bottle. The aroma is more tart and citrusy than before but still very much fruitjuicy. It almost smells like there is a pinch of nutmeg in there but of course there isnt its just my nose making strange associations. Another association is actually Bret. The expression is less like fruit punch and more like citrus and a bit of resin or withered hops but still very pleasant and harmonic. Im assuming Stigbergets put a 6 month BBD on their bottles meaning this was brewed in October 30th 2016 making it two months old to the date of drinking. In the mouth the palate is similar to before and the flavour us similar in terms of the subdued bitterness but the aroma notes are again more citrus, resin, nutmeg and earthiness compared to the younger specimen. It has so far aged in a graceful way. Personally I prefer the fresher version, which is more directly gratifying but this one is certainly also enjoyable and perhaps a bit more autumn than summer in its expression.
ORIGINAL RATING FROM NOVEMBER 24th 2016 (A: 8; Ap: 4; Fl: 8; Pa: 4; O: 16)
(33 cl bottle from Systembolaget; Batch #542; BBD: 30.04.17) Poured at fridge temperature into a Rochefort goblet reveals a cloudy amber body with one finger of white head that fades somewhat leaving film and nice lace. Aroma is hopforward in a pure fruit juice way with notes of mango, peach and tropical fruits. Oily texture, solid mouthfeel, soft carbonation, medium body and sweet finish. Flavour has plenty of aroma notes and a very subdued bitterness making the beer very drinkable. The GBG Beer Week that I enjoyed last week was quite similar to this and its a bit difficult to discern the subtleties of the differences without having them side by side but perhaps this one has slightly less sweat and onion.","DENMARK","humlelala"
3876,"2016-11-24",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2017 Didnt pour it all in at once since its unfiltered, pouring that in a bit later, so almost no head at all. 
Very hazy (duh) golden orange coloured beer. Like a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. 
Aroma is... just wow.. freshly squeezed orange and mango juice with a little bit of pineapple added, but also that lovely piney aroma. 
Taste is orange up front, mango in the middle and then grapefruit & piney bitterness at the back. As it warms up, the sweetness from the ""fruits"" shows up a lot more. Not as good as the aroma but still very good. 
A bit sticky in the mouth, extremely drinkable. 
I havent tried their GBG Beer Week so I cant compare but this is, to me, the IPA goal. 6,5 % ABV but still goes down way too fast, you just cant help to almost chug this one. If Stigberget made a DIPA version of this I think it would be my favorite one yet. 
So glad I bought 5 of these.","Malmö, SWEDEN","EerieDrinks"
