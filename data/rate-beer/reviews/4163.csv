4163,"2017-05-21",3.3,"I got this in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John!

This pours a dark brown with reddish hues and a very large head of tannish foam thats trying to overflow but...well have none of that! Excellent head retention and plenty of nice lacing.

The smell is nice. Im getting some biscuit, a touch of roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, and some dark fruit.

The taste starts of very sweet. The caramel and chocolate and some biscuit are pretty bold up front. Another sip in and theres a touch of hop bitterness just before the finish and I can also taste some other bitterness most likely from a dark chocolate influence. This is nice. 

The body is on the thin side but it seems to be filling for some reason; the carbonation is also light. I dont notice any of the alcohol until long after the swallow; thats when I get a bit of warming.

Bottom line: This is quite the tasty Bock. The only ""bad"" thing I can really say about it is that I couldnt drink more than 1 at a sitting.(see my comment about it being filling)","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"
4163,"2017-02-22",4.3,"Ever since spotted Cow I've been a fan. Uff-Da have all the right notes without overpowering coffee, chocolate for the person that might want to get there feet wet with the DARK side of beer! Looking forward to drinking my second Uff-Da with the next spicy dish to compliment! Job well done!

4163,"2017-01-15",4.4,"Had a pint of this on the brewery tour. Bock is one of my favorite styles. A rich flavor and great body. Toffee and some chocolate. This has the characteristics of a authentic German bock. Some malt roastiness in the finish.  Im rating this one from the bottle as I bought some from the brewery.","Elk Grove Village, Illinois, USA","chicagobears"

Beige creamy head dies a bit too quickly, minimal to no lacing. Flavor is watery dark fruit with tobacco. High alcohol content completely undetectable. Good, but for this style I expected far more from New Glarus. Bottle.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","pkbites"

4163,"2016-11-02",4.4,"When conversation arises concerning American brewers who make exceptionally good German beers, New Glarus rightfully tends to be brought up in that conversation. Uff-da is one of the reasons New Glarus belongs in that dialogue. This is a rich, full-bodied Bock that pours a very dark brown and has a tan head. Malty, lightly smoky, and somewhat fruity nose. Flavor is complex, even for a big beer such as this. Chocolaty and syrupy malt, a subtle, smoky meatiness, dark fruits, and coffee. When you step away and look at all the taste profiles coming together, it all sounds a bit weird. However, this Bock is extraordinarily cohesive and approachable. Somehow, all the pieces fit.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

4163,"2016-09-28",3.7,"On tap at the Mars Cheese Castle bar. Pours plain thin black. Flavor is rich, fruity, slightly nutty, but still fairly light bodied. Slightly dry finish. More on the Schwartzbier end of the spectrum than the bock, but good.","Illinois, USA","drdisque"
4163,"2016-09-24",3.8,"This is a great beer. Nose is dates, sweet malt. Pours a dark ruby brown, low head. Taste is smooth, malt, light roast coffee, sweet brown sugar or light caramel. On the tongue its both sweet and bitter, playing off the sides and middle of the tongue. Finishes slight crisp, with lingering sweetness. Its making me wish I drank more bocks.","Wisconsin, USA","Gespuccian"
4163,"2016-09-08",3.7,"5oz draft sample at the brewery tasting room. Poured a medium brown, filtered clear.

4163,"2014-12-27",3.8,"Nice rich caramel coloured body with a touch of a cola glow and a thinnish tan head. Aroma of raisins, malt, alcohol, light ptit fruits, earth and some good hazelnuts and pecans - strong and pungent. Medium-bodied; Earthy bite of malt with a bit of brown sugar, raisins, figs, light spice and alcohol initially. Aftertaste shows a pleasant slight sour note of grapes with immediate nutty and sweet caramel flavours with an earthy bite on the finish - very nice and complex, especially for the style. Overall, another great beer for the style and in general from New Glarus - you pretty much know what to expect before you buy one of their beers, but they seemingly never stop their talent of producing great beers in the style - this is no exception. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from the Edelweiss Shop in Verona, Wisconsin on 24-September-2014 for US$3,00 by my mom while visiting, sampled at home in Washington on 25-December-2014 - thanks Mom!","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

4163,"2013-11-01",3.4,"12 oz. bottle. This has a deep copper color to it, or a light caramel brown appearance, I guess. Mahogany is actually a good way to describe the color. Lots of foam sitting on top. Yep, this sure looks like a bock to me. Aroma is raisin, caramel, sugar, cereal (malt), yeast, maybe a hint of toffee. Theyd have a hard time selling me on the coffee bit, but I guess theres a touch of chocolate in there. Very crisp, and edgy, but the odd thing is is that this sucker has a nice formidable texture to it, too. The texture is kind of a paradox, but thats how I feel. Flavor is more like an Abbey Dubbel than a bock, in my opinion; however, I can taste some bock-like qualities. Heavy raisin, and yeast flavor. Very small bits of light chocolate poke through, but again, its not very prominent. Theres a fluttering bitterness at the end, but I wouldnt say it stands out very much.

It pours a dark brown with red highlights. A dunkles for sure. The gravity suggests this should pretty much have the characteristics of a doppelbock.

It smells like an American doppelbock, there is just something in every American brewed German styled beer that seperates the two. It falls between the malt bill and the execution and brewing equipment/process. There is a hint of cocoa and rootbeer.

The flavor is more of that of a traditional bock. It is sweet but roasty with just a touch of hops that is barely noticeable but key in providing a tiny smitten of balance. Some notable flavors are sweet dark fruits and caramel.

The lines it leaves after I take a drink are so well defined. It was really cool to see after I was done with this beer, but that was also a sad moment in time. The color is a very appealing robust red/brown.

Smell is very similar to a porter. Very nice roasted malts and caramel. Taste is quite similar and you can definitely taste the 7.3% alcohol. The flavor of caramel is very present in the taste.

Mouthfeel is very smooth and the carbonation level is very great. Full bodied.

Wow is probably one of the best words to describe this beer. It is absolutely amazing and well exceeded my expectations. I really recommend this beer to anyone, so if you go to Wisconsin, do yourself a favor and buy a sixer or more!

The aroma is nice and shows dark chocolate and roasted coffee as the malt base along with some dark fruit of raisins and figs. The flavor shows more of the figs, raisins, and plums and are blended really well with the smooth, rich chocolate. The roasted coffee comes through as well and leaves a nice bitterness on the backend. Medium bodied with good carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel lead to a roasted chocolate finish.

Complex flavors, different than you can find in other styles of beer.  Maybe it is more what it doesnt have, because the main flavors of dark chocolate and coffee, dark malt and dark fruit, with a bit of hard old time candy are found it other beers, but there is often other things that are mixed in that are not present here.  Its a beer that doesnt try to be all things, but tries to be very good at just a few things.  Well worth a go.","Minnesota, USA","EHopper"

The beer starts out with a nice chesnut brown color sitting under a 2-finger tan head. Mostly clear with a touch of haze to it. The aroma I could get was lightly roasted malts with a bit of caramel to it. Flavor was pretty much the same...light roasted malts and caramel. Hides the alcohol really well, as it was a nice smooth beer without any unpleasant harshness. I can see the quaffability factor being really high with this beer.

4163,"2008-08-10",3.8,"Pours a rich chocolate brown, and glowing red near the edges, forming a sticky thin film of white.  Earthy, smoky and sweet herbal wood aroma, like tree bark stewed in anise and dark chocolate.  Deep undercurrents of rock candy, dried caramel, and brown sugar, with just the slightest hints of red berries and banana; a stunning portrait of malt complexity in the details of coffee, fruits, dark spicing and chocolate, cut just slightly with herbal bitterness.  Calm and gorgeous.Alternately, there’s a bit too much crystal malt for the textures of the other malts to show through in the flavor, and it initially comes across as a simple bittersweet blend of sugary coffee and herbal iced tea.  With warming, the brown sugar-dipped flavors of munich malts in dried cranberries and raisins, swimming in a dense bread, thicken the substance somewhat.  Herbal touches of bay leaf and anise are persistent, and somewhat cooling, and that’s a strange sensation in this type of malt structure; it’s somewhat similar to the astringency ill-advised coffee beans lend to a brown ale or a porter, but it’s much more subtle and better integrated than that; it rubs off nicely on the various forms of malt sweetness, and abets balance.Medium-full palate is syrupy and sticky; effervescent, but clingy toward the finish, where a sugary chocolate malt component is most prominent, with a bitter pecan and toasted walnut skin flavor amidst maple syrup in the furthest smacking bittersweetness.  The malt driven character is pristine; this is a wonderful example of the solidity of this brewery’s products when craft and finesse are the requirements more so than attitude and creativity.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

4163,"2008-01-20",3.6,"The pour is an incredibly deep, dark violet color with a cola brown tint.  A dense, frothy, medium sized tan head shows good retention and leaves behind sheets of micro-foam lace.  The aroma is all malt and fruit, with deeply roasted caramel being the primary component.  Chocolate covered raisons emerge, as do alcohol soaked figs, plums, and a dose of cream.  The flavor is the perfect compliment, with sweet, rich caramel blending well against a massively fruity backdrop.  Figs, plums, and raisons are again all separately identifiable, yet they are brought together wonderfully by a binding, creamy chocolate.  The finish is medium-long, fruity, and clean.  A medium body with good carbonation makes for a pleasing mouthfeel, though mild cloyingness lingers after the swallow.  Pretty solid brew from a style I admittedly dont know much about.  Id bet this one would be stellar if aged in a bourbon barrel, as that would impart a perfectly complimentary element.  As is, this is very good.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Fore is flowery, dark malts, some dark fruits, dough, chocolate and yeast. Extremely creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied, very soft carbonation and a joy to drink. No hint at all of the relatively high ABV, this beer is unbelievably quaffable. Finish is chocolate, toffee/caramel candy, plums, dates and a wonderfully long blast of fresh baked dark bread. The doughy notes running throughout really keep any sweetness in check, and as a result this beer never gets anywhere near being cloying or overdone in that department.

A one-finger plus tall head that was off-white to tan in color rested briefly before succumbing to the darkness below it.  A nice galaxy swirl hung out on top of the beer the whole way down and light lacing was produced.  The aroma was malts, brown sugar, banana, yeast and even a bit of chocolate.  The flavor was roasted malt, smoke and some chocolate initially but settled into a more standard malt, brown sugar, banana and slightly sour dark fruits as it opened up.  The mouthfeel was a 3+, held in check by a lingering finish that was at times unpleasant.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","Soonah"

Id had this before but never rated it, so Im glad I had the chance here.  Clear brown beer with not much tan head, but deep and slow sub-surface ""racing.""  Toasty aroma wafts around a clear presence of porty and vinous alcohol.  Palate is thiner than I like, but Ive come to expect that from New Glarus.

Nice malty aroma of freshly baked gingerbread cookie, with a hint of molasses, and a gentle brush of light chocolate.  A hint of vanilla lightens it up a bit, and some very faint fudgy, borderline raisiny fruit characters round out the bouquet.  Medium light bodied, softly, yet sufficiently carbonated mouthfeel.  A chewy, lightly fruity dark malt character starts off on the palate, with lots of chocolate.  Very soft malt flavors, free of any harsh roast or grain tannin sharpness.

4163,"2007-04-07",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2009 4/07/2007: Perfect pour into my Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock glass. New Glarus Uff-da Bock is a clear, dark ruby-brown color with a substantial, dense, creamy mocha-colored head.  The head slowly collapses and leaves a thin, frothy crown. The residual lacing is quite prolific and detailed. Deep caramel malts and molasses combine with a hit of smoke, coffee, and alchohol to create a wonderfully inviting aroma. The rich and robust flavor has coffee, chocolate caramel, dark fruit. There is also some nice, delicate char/smoky undertones wafting around as well.  Overall, the flavor is moderately sweet with some roasty charasteristics as well. The mild bitterness helps to balance the flavor in the dry, roasty, light chocolate finish.  This beer has a slightly higher than average body and is smooth. This is a really nice bock. Why am I surprised?  ll of the beers from New Glarus are great! 12 oz bottle purchased on 11/11/2006 at the New Glarus Brewery. I also received a bottle from buckybeer as a bonus in trade (Nov 2006). Thanks Mark!
11/12/2007: Uff-Da Bock pours a clear, brown to dark brown color.  It has a long-lasting, foamy, dark beige head. The aroma is very malty with a hint of roast along with a sweet, syrupy quality to it.  The flavor has substaintial maltiness with undertones of roasted malt, nuts, amaretto, and a dusting of chocolate.  This beer shows some strength, but it is mostly obscured by the intenese flavors. Good amount of lacing on the glass. Medium-full body, very smooth, mellow palate, great mouthfeel. 12 fl. oz. bottle from my friend Jason.  Thanks!","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"

Uff-Da pours a deep dark mahogany. I got a 1 finger tan head with an aggressive pour. It faded quickly to a light coating. This beer looks really good.The head did fade faster than I wouldve liked though.

Theres a lot of scents going on with this one. Dark fruits and a sweetness. Mild chocolate and roasted malts. 

Taste is good. Starts out with some cherry, coffee and roasted malts and gets sweet from there. I would like a little stronger flavor but its still good.

As I drink it coats the mouth. I can feel it on my teeth. Its medium bodied but I think just a little light for the style.

The drinkability is good. Smooth and easy drinking especially for a bock.

The nose is strong of biscuits and raisins and not so strong of damp cellar. Though I didnt notice any coffee aromas, there is a definite, defined flavor of roasty java and almonds.

4163,"2006-07-21",2.7,"From a twist cap 12 oz. long neck brown bottle with a blurb on the right side of label.

Poured a dark blackish brown with some faint red hues, a small tan head that quickly settled into a fine lacing.

Aromas of burnt chocolate and roasted grain, a light fruitiness and whiffs of alcohol.

Moderate carbonation, for me, too low, a softly crisp, smooth medium bodied mouthfeel, because of the low carbonation, there is a heaviness in the mouthfeel.

The taste is best thing, for me, about this bock, burnt chocolate poured over dark fruits, a touch of cream, the alcohol provides a nice warmth in the palate and a dry, sweet roasted grainy finish.

For me, the carbonation is too low, keeping this from being a first rate bock. I think more carbonation would bring a little more needed lightness to the body and would only help the taste.","East Central, Georgia, USA","jpm30"

4163,"2006-06-09",3.7,"Late 2005 bottle from StewardofGondor, drunk on 6/10/06.  Careful pour reveals medium-high to high clarity.  Wonderfully deep magenta highlights, with brass and earthen tones near the edges and surface.  A chestnut-coal brown from most outward appearances (not held to the light).  Head is medium-beige and fades quickly to cover, providing ample lacing.  Rich nuttiness is alleviated immediately by creamy vanilla tresses tipped by chocolate covered prunes.  Inviting and boisterous for its strength, neither coffee nor bock-like wininess is overdone (or underdone).  As usual, New Glarus shows off its strong-point (balance).  Taking a sip, Im surprised by the thick, chewy, nearly imperial stout-like cakey malts.  Gooey chocolate and graham crackers roll about in the mouth, as yeast and melanoidins dry things out, while simultaneously adding that strong, dark fruitiness that adds complexity.  On the very end, a hint of chocolate-tipped cigars is felt as the (roasted?) malt adds a touch of tobacoo/ashiness.  With some time, the thickness lets up a bit as bready malts replace it.  But the prunes and raisins never fail, and certainly the chocolate goes nowhere.  Ive seen doppelbocks that arent as strong as this stuff, but to its credit, it remains drinkable, not alcoholic and balanced in its attenuation.  The carbonation is another plus here, as  it seems natural and is very engaging without being intrusive.  Its been a while since Ive had such a balanced and complex bock as this.  Most just pulverize you with malt or deliver too much breadiness and oiliness.  I could see a bit more crisp yeast bite on the end making this that much more special, but its difficult to gripe here.  Im getting peanut skins and very light tobacco on the finish, with the lively, lightly acidic dark berry notes leading all the way to the end and balancing the malts perfectly.  New Glarus does it again.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The initial aroma I get is a cidery ester, but it went away quickly replaced by a chocolatey malt aroma.  The flavor is excellent, clean malty flavor starting with chocolate and coffee and moving to a distinct nuttiness as it warms up, reminding me of pistachios.  Nice body and the carbonation seems to linger even as the beer warms up.  You cant even really notice the alcohol with this, I would have guessed around 6%.

Yep, kinda, its a whole lotta empty malts that renders some roastyness and seems to be quite solid and smooth but no other characteristics can be found.

4163,"2003-07-05",3.7,"My goodness, thhis is like an Aass Bock clone.  Big bocky malty aroma, simple caramel flavor.  Sweet, but not overly so.  Remarkably clear, rust brown appearance.

4163,"2003-06-06",3.6,"Dry finish, yet the flavor is a bit sweet due to all of the malts.  It is definetly not the most malty of bocks, but it is smooth and mild.  Easy to drink.  The alcohol is non-existent in the flavor and the aroma.  A gint of cloves and other spices.  Dark amber body, little head.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"
4163,"2003-05-24",2.5,"Well, this is a rather anticlimactic number 300 for me, but what the hell, I've been having a good beer night up until now.  Nice copper color, but zero head - bland aroma, slight cloves - flavor has a slight caramel touch with a tiny clove bitterness - I don't sense anything the commercial description suggests at all - if you want an accurate description of this beer, just think of it as everything the company's description is not.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
4163,"2003-04-19",1.8,"A so-so bock. Watery and brown-sugar sweet. Great name, tired beer. No finish what so ever. Cheap as far as local beer goes.","Da U.P. eh?, Michigan, USA","I.C.suds"
4163,"2003-01-28",3.2,"Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing. Body is clear dark orange-brown. Aroma is moderately malty (nutty, toasted dark bread, caramel), lightly hoppy (herbs), with a note of brown sugar, hint of toffee. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery (almost syrupy) texture, lively carbonation. A bit too sugary/syrupy sweet (so contrary to the implication on the label, do NOT let it get too warm), but a pretty decent aroma. Hey, at least they're not dumping Cascades in here. Didn't notice any alcohol.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Not really much to note here, other than this is an average, rather boring, unoffensive beer.  It seems possible to me that this is quite variable from batch to batch, cos I remember this being better a few months ago when I first had it.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
4163,"2002-08-07",2.6,"Interesting crimson color, with a thick, but quickly dissipated, orange head. Almost no aroma. Early taste is that of dark chocolate. Moves to more of a coffee flavor as it warms. Tasted nuts occasionally too. The alcohol became significantly more pronounced by the middle of the beer. The chocolate was back by the end, but the bite from the alcohol was still present. A decent sipping beer, but not something Ill drink regularly.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","Pjones6738"
4163,"2002-05-05",3.3,"I have never given such disparate marks to aroma and flavor. A malt lovers dream in the nose, this became indistinct and muddied in the mouth. I maybe got a bit of chocolate, no coffeeishness, high alcohol. Chewy, which helped (this would have been really terrible with a super-thin body). Ive got to get a deeper bock understanding, I do believe.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
4163,"2002-05-04",2.9,"Gorgeous crystal clear dark copper. Thin creamy white head. Very light carbonation. Little aroma, like spent grain and light sulfur. Initially rough with a hard water like harshness. Light cherry and burnt chocolate underbelly. Medium bodied. Light crispness. This is OK at times but has a very hard edge that irks me. Very little depth of malt flavor as well. Finishes nutty sweet and a little more hefty in alcohol, but this is merely eh.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"

Wow! 14 years since my first rating of this.  Crazy!  Big caramel toasted malt toffee on the nose.  Flavors exhibit similar however has a bit of husky quality which I really like.  Great bock for sure!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"

At half the price, Id take this any day over Celebrator, but I can see its a lighter bock beer, not so impressive in style, more common, however I prefer the taste, especially cold, the caramel, chocolate coffee undertones, just a great flavor, almost sexy.

4163,"2001-10-27",3.5,"UPDATED: OCT 16, 2016 (October 2016): 12 ounce bottle from Badger Spirits in Beloit, WI, served a bit below cellar temp in a Hoegaarden mug.  Creamy light tan head topping a deep transulent caramel body dies at some speed leaving minimal lacing...lightly smoky, caramel-laden aroma, hints of figs or dates, faint herbal notes...sweet, bready caramel malts expectedly dominate the body, very light warming alcohol notes and a touch of pepperiness at the drier finish...body rather light for style but not watery; carbonation somewhat strong; something of a root beer character to the whole thing.  Still a pretty solid beer, but forgive my youthful exuberance 15 years ago - its hardly a masterpiece.  Rating is for this sampling.

(October 2001):  Spicy, strong nose on a beautiful ruby-red body; very assertive sweet, full-bodied bock flavor with a bit of caramel and holiday breads; end is a bit too hoppy, but this is still an almost-classic.
