3789,"2006-11-20",3.3,"Tap at the 5.  Dark hazy brown.  Aroma of banana and cloves.  Tastes of mixed berries and maybe even a bit nutty.  Very balanced and easy drinking. Especially if you are a fan of this style.","Georgia, USA","unclemattie"
3789,"2006-02-12",3.8,"This was a damn fine brew.  Almost chewy bublegum flavor with lots of chocolate malt and carmel and Excellent banana and clove mixture.  This beer was so freakin good, I dont know how to handle myself.  It was a nice copper color and the flavor betrayed some molasses and walnut hints as well.  damn.  another fine brew from the 5","Marietta, Ohio, USA","LilKem"
3789,"2005-12-28",3.6,"On tap at the 2005 GCBC: Pours a hazy dark copper with a nice lightly-lacing light tan head.  Sweet dark caramel and estery aroma has some good banana and clove presence.  Body starts with a nice sugary sweetness balanced with some tart esters and a dry finish.  Has a light strawberry fruitiness throughout.  A pretty nice weizenbock.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3789,"2005-11-25",3.8,"Tap at 5 seasons.  Nice dark but not too dark pour.  Bananna and nut aroma which are also the main taste elements.   Some spices and clove, carmel and chocolate.  Nice creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied.  I rather enjoyed this one.  Recommended.","oxford, Georgia, USA","Hangover"
3789,"2005-11-16",3.4,"on draught. Pours a cloudy plum hue without a head. The nose is slightly vinous with cloves and light soil. Rather dry. The flavor is rich of dates, cloves, and a banana-like sweetness. This is a nice warming brew but is just slightly too thin.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
3789,"2005-11-08",3.8,"Brown with a golden tinit and beige head.  Fruity aroma with golden raisins and typical esters of banana.  Flavor matches aroma but adds some lemon.  Full mouth start with a lighter finish.  Very tasty.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
3789,"2005-11-06",3.4,"Cloudy dark brown body with an ok head. The aroma is good banana and nutty. Its a bit dry and thin. Its good, but not really in the top level of weizenbocks, though.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
3789,"2005-11-06",4.2,"Sampled at GCBC 2005. Pours cloudy dark brown with a fully receding tan head.  Aroma is loaded with cloves, a little bit of banana noted as it warmed.  Reminded me very much of the bready, nutty, aroma of cooked banana bread.  Quite similar to Aventinus in appearance and smell.  Taste is phenolic with apples, nectarines, and lots of cloves.  Lots of spicy yeast and nutty, caramel malts. Medium bodied with high carbonation.  Quite well executed, I could drink this every day.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","TheBeerOrg"
3789,"2005-11-04",3.7,"ha, no one has rated this yet and I shall be the first. It had a rummish/apple cider color to it with a fairly large eggshell head.  I got some spices in the aroma, but not sure what they specifically were, and i got a little dull apple in it and some light caramel. The body was very smooth and somewhat thick.  Had a muddy, murky feel. Tasted like leather that had been soaked in vinegar, then doused with water and some malted milk balls minus the chocolate.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"
