Poured on draft into a shaker pint. 

Appearance: Pours a dark cola brown with a 1/2 finger grey-tan head. Nice lacing.

Smell: Dark brewed coffee and toasted malt with a touch of sweetness.

Taste: Toasted malt up front followed by earthy hops and a German grainy quality in the middle before ending with a lightly sweet finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full-bodied with good carbonation. Very thick for a beer with 5.5% ABV.

Drinkability: Good drinkability. You could have a few without much difficulty.

This one pours a nice a dark, black color with a touch of mahogany at the edges and crowned by a thick mocha colored head of foam that shows good retention. The head leaves scattered splotches of lace around the glass as it slowly settles to a thin film. The aroma shows a big roasty character hinting at dry chocolate and mocha mostly along with notes of coffee and toasted caramel malt. Just a hint of bitterness creeps in the back end from some piney hops. The aroma is very nicely balanced. The flavor follows suit with ample amounts of dark cocoa, dry cocoa roast, toasted mocha, along with the sweet, toasted caramel malt. Some piney hops add balancing bitterness on the back end. The palate is exactly as it should be with a medium body and almost creamy mouthfeel with perfect carbonation leading to a roasted cocoa finish. Quite different from most CCB beers as they tend to be quite substantial on the palate. Delicious stuff that I could drink multiple pints of and be quite happy.

4374,"2012-01-03",3.5,"My Bottom Line :  
Prominent roasted malts and their coffee bean angles dominate this lagers date and vanilla-like fruitiness for a sweet but quite flavorful pint.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A ring of foam circles the blackness with dark brown hues.
-The low carbonation makes the sugars feel bigger. 
-This is rather drinkable but it is obviously brewed to suit North Americans tastes for bolder brews. This is richer than any authentic Schwarzbier Ive had.
-Mouthfeel is slick and silky.
