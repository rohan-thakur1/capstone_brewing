903,"2017-03-12",3.5,"On bottle at Raw Wine London. Miky white colour. Rice aroma. Dry. Refined. Like a light sauvignon blanc. Lemon. Slight nutty maybe. I liked it. Quite dry and citrus fruity.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
903,"2015-08-13",3.3,"Bottle, 08/13/2014. Pours a cloudy white, like diluted skim milk. Aroma is light and delicate, light yogurt and rice milk, soft melon with some nutty character. Taste as well, rice yeast and mild pear, apple notes add mellow tart sweetness, light alcohol. Light medium body, sediment somewhat noticeable. Decent nigori, though not so bold.","New York, USA","jbeatty"
903,"2014-07-09",3.6,"More opaque than cloudy. Green apple, mild cucumber, alcohol and a nice sweetness to it. Flavor had great balance between tart fruit notes and sweet grains. Smooth palate. Alcohol was a nice warming presence throughout.","New York, USA","crazyvin"

903,"2012-06-26",3.0,"Bottle dated March of 2012 (I am assuming packaging date). Pours with a hazy milky white hue with a lot of fine particles, but thankfully no chunks. Some legs. Aroma is pretty bland, some minerals, koji, a good kick of fusel. Low fruity notes. Flavors are equally bland. Some banana, light stonefruit, minerals, mild salinity, lychee (the sort of meaty aspect of it), unripe plums. Starchy, nutty, low vanilla, strong alcohol. Moderate to slightly fuller heft to the body, still, warming, low burn. Decently dry nigori.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
903,"2012-01-22",2.1,"Bottle (shaken, not stirred). No head (still). Body is cloudy white. Aroma is a strong note of sweat socks and mold, other notes of vitamin B, rice milk, vinegar, melon rind. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery/gritty texture, no carbonation, moderately alcoholic, lightly astringent. 

Phew.  Really unpleasant moldy/musty odor of stinky feet, vinegar, and raw vitamin B.  Not as opaque and bright white as others Ive tried, like very heavily diluted milk.  Not as sweet as most either, which is a good thing.  Still, overall its pretty repulsive due to the aroma.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

903,"2011-07-08",3.6,"The bottle is a few years old, date 09.2006, probably bought in Texas in Jan 2007There is quite some sediment in the bottle, and even if it was standing upright for years, some of it pours into the glass; the liquid has a very light yellow/pink hue. The aroma is deep; some watermelon, sweet, alcohol, almonds. The mouthfeel is very smooth, with some rice flavor and rice starch, rather sweet, light watermelon and plums, balanced alcohol feeling.

903,"2007-11-24",3.6,"300 ml chilled bottle served in a large red wine glass and consumed over about an hour.  I havent tried sake since before my children were born (my oldest is now 18).  I used to drink it at a Japanese restaurant in Manhattan called ""East"" that my wife and I used to vsisit BC (before children).  Moving forward to the present, I was in a liquor store in NJ last month and saw this sake.  I read the description on the back and decided to give it a try.  My wife and I shared the bottle last night.  Pours a partially opaque, partially translucent  milky white.  Very pleasant aroma of rice with some vanilla notes, which really surprised me.  A few alcohol vapors present as well, but they do not interfere.  The flavor is rice with a little bit of nuttiness and a very warming alcohol finish.  Very nice creamy mouthfeel.  I enjoyed sitting and relaxing with this sake, and I look forward to trying some others.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
903,"2007-11-04",3.6,"300 mL bottle.  Interesting hazy, no color.  Aroma very floral and tropical.  Flavor is delightful, mild, refined, flowing.  Just a little hint of spice on the back.  Overall, very enjoyable, but forgettable.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","jlf278"
903,"2007-10-21",3.8,"300 ml bottle served chilled (but drunk over an hour or so) in a very small conical glass, at Asiana House in Burlington, VT, October 15 2007.  This was my first sake experience in over 15 years, so I had no idea what to expect, really.  I hated the beverage the first couple of times I had it so long ago, and I suspect it was some cheapo brand; this would be something entirely new.  It poured just lightly hazy/translucent and virtually colorless, getting almost entirely opaque by the time the bottle was finished....the aroma is absolutely entrancing:  peaches and aprictots, a hint of tropical fruits (passion fruit, mango), a bit of vanilla, just exactly potent enough to wow without being overbearing, and no trace of alcoholic harshness, even by the finish....on the tongue, the alcohol is felt certainly but is never oppressive; the flavor is fruity, lightly malty -- I for one can immediately tell that this is a beverage more closely allied to beer than to anything else -- moderately sweet, smooth, with just a bit of pepperiness towards the finish.....quite smooth, slightly thick, unfiltered and still.  I loved this at first, though by the end it was just a little fatiguing and a bit too alcoholic; perhaps a smaller dose, drunk colder and quicker, would have impressed more?  Still, quite nice, and I now look forward to future experiences....","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
903,"2007-10-14",3.2,"300ml bottle from tytoanderso; nose of coconut and rice; hazy semi-transparent white; flavor of rice, alcohol, and slight nuttiness, finish is dry with slight tartness and alcohol.

903,"2007-09-04",3.4,"The 1st sake in our flight (and my first ever) at Indras Mead, Cider and Sake Tasting on 8/31/07. Pours a cloudy, icy white (like a melted lemonade Popsicle) with small suspended particles. The nose is much like Bananas Foster and cream made with vodka vs. rum. Light, slightly grainy yet soft, the palate finishes lightly dry. The flavor follows the nose to a ""T"". Overall, Id have to say that Im a fan of the style.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"
903,"2007-09-03",3.4,"UPDATED: SEP 5, 2007 300mL bottle from State Line Liquors, Elkton, MD, labeled 1/2007. Poured cloudy, slightly milky white, with some particles in suspension and no head.

903,"2007-08-03",3.8,"Sampled at The Cellars Wine & Spirits wine tasting. An unfiltered sake with a cloudy white  beverage that has tiny rice particles.

903,"2007-07-22",3.6,"My first real sake (besides that crap they serve hot at sushi restaurants). $17 for a 300ml was rather steep, although this is quite nice. Drank from a very small, straight edges glass -- closest thing I could find to a normal sake cup.

Pours very cloudy white, totally beautiful. Nose of great sticky rice. A tiny bit hot. White grape. Not getting much else in the nose besides that but its still very nice. Flavor starts off kind of like vodka, then a lot of rice, then a sweet, fruity kick, before a boozy finish. The fruitiness is real nice. Very drinkable, and much less hot than 16% beers Ive had. Tasty stuff, and a great introduction to sake, Id say.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
903,"2007-07-21",3.6,"Rated 7/21/07.  Served chilled and shaken.  Not as much sediment as a typical Nigori.  Lightly milky, pearlescent appearance.  The aroma is sweet, with rice, pear, plum, and cotton candy.  The flavor is  sweet, and masks the alcohol quite well.  Medium body that goes down ultra smooth.  Great with spicy foods.  An old standby that is available at many sushi restaurants.  Always a safe bet.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
903,"2007-03-08",2.4,"Has a medicinal overtone if not served very cold.  Mild flavor, lacking character, except at the end when the cloudy rice lees add a very pleasant sweetness, and thicken the mouth-feel.","USA","ldr514"

903,"2006-09-14",3.4,"UPDATED: APR 30, 2007 Fairly fresh bottle, probably early-mid 2006, 300mL, purchased from Belfast, ME co-op and consumed on 9/3/06.This one didnt have nearly as much sediment as most nigoris Ive seen, which created a less milky, more glossy pearl-like appearance.  Light enamel and light-cream tones.  Still in the glass, and creating some moderate legs.Very nutty smell, much moreso than Ive seen in a nigori, without the extreme tropical-fruitiness.  Coconut-pineapple is still apparent, inevitably, but its matched in stride by a sticky rice-sugar and light, dry, rice sharpness.  Alcohol is well-concealed in the aroma.  Aroma strength is high, but I must say I had to really stretch to pull many complexities out of it.Soft and comforting is the palate, with a growing rice dryness that seems to climax on the finish.  I expect harsh alcohol or a heavy sharp-graininess, but it never comes.  Rather a light milky-pineapple flavor up front, with warm honey-walnut paste sitting bluntly on the end.  Very neutral, fruit-skin-like notes, like extremely unripened pear/nectarine perhaps.  Strong nuttiness, rather chewy at times, but also, with the lower amount of sediment, it does seem a touch watery in places.  A light dose of white and black pepper further dries the finish.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
903,"2006-01-25",3.3,"Gave the bottle a good shake to mix up the sediment.  Cloudy off-white body.  Aroma is anise coconut, peppery spice and some alcohol.

Feels somewhat like coconut milk, slick and thin. Light milk and ripe fruit flavors with more alcohol. Quite warming. If the alcohol was not quite so overbearing this would be very tasty.
