3189,"2015-09-01",3.2,"Draught @ Underbelly, San Diego. Aroma is sweet with buttery malt and fruity hops. Flavour has grassy hops, fruits, some herbal bitterness and mild fruits. Rather fruity for a pale lager.","Tampere, FINLAND","laiti"

3189,"2014-01-25",3.6,"On tap at Trappist Provisions. Believe it or not, Ive been tracking this one down for a while now. I can see why its rated so highly as a pale lager. It kind of changes your mind on what this style can actually be. It pours a clear golden color with a nice white head. The aroma is rather spicy and floral with a light maltiness that has some corn and apple, but not over the top. The flavor is full bodied with prominent spicy and floral hops, more corn and light malts. Very creamy mouthfeel. Excellent stuff.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

3189,"2013-04-13",2.9,"Pint at some Studio City, CA restaurant. Poured a pretty clear yellow color, foamy white head. Aroma was light malts, adjuncts, crisp hops. Flavor was light malts, crisp hops. Drinkable in a pinch, Id rather reach for something else. Maybe when its 100 degrees in LA, Id grab this one over one of the more fizzy yellow brews.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
3189,"2013-01-27",3.6,"On tap at Fathers Office, Santa Monica. Compared favorably with the Stillwater pre-Pro lager. Vibrant golden-orange pour with a lively, fluffy head and plenty of brimming carbonation. Nose was very inviting with plenty of bitter hops, a touch of must and tart fruit. Bracing flavors, quite sharp and grassy, just a bit of funk peeking out from the herbal deliciousness.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

3189,"2012-02-28",4.0,"Tasted on tap at Beer Revolution on 2/17/2012. This Pale Lager pours a hazy yellow gold color from the tap. Small to medium bodied white foamy head. The aroma is cereal, grainy, sweet, orange and honey. A touch of corn, but in a good way. A medium bodied pale lager. The malts are cereal and grainy, some orange and orange peel. The hops are floral and citrusy. Nice balance. Good carbonation. I know this beer has a lot of corn in it, but all you can taste of the corn is the sweetness. Light and refreshing. Touch of orange at the finish. Very easy drinking beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter with some residual sweetness.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

3189,"2010-12-18",3.7,"A: The pour is a clear golden amber color with a finger worth of white head that has pretty good retention.

S: Theres a pretty nice bready malt character to the nose along with the distinctive aroma of lager yeast. Not a ton of hop aroma, but a nice bit of floral and grassy hop character.

T: A solid bread and malt flavor to start this one off. Theres a touch of toasted character to it as well as some very subtle hints of corn. The hops are a bit more pronounced on the palate and give the beer a pleasing bitterness and balance.

M: The body is medium, pretty solid for this sort of lager, with a moderate level of carbonation.

D: This was one of the better Craftsman beers Ive had. Quite a solid beer and very easy to drink.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3189,"2010-10-30",3.5,"Sampled at the brewery...thanks Patrick!  18 karat golden color with a 1/3 inch ivory foam that left a descent amount of lacing.  Nice, slightly herbal and bready nose/flavor with some grassy elements.  Also showed moderate fruitiness.  Didnt get the heavy corn influence you would guess from the description.

Very dry, crisp aroma showing herbal and grassy hop character; refreshing, light graininess; lovely crisp nose. Light-to-medium body: lots of crisp, toasty and bready malt character; juicy herbal and mineral bitterness; an absolutely lovely premium lager (evidently: pale lager); balanced, crisp, perfectly attenuated, pleasantly soft-seeming water: great stuff here. Awesome, and something that Id love to see more of.

Still corny, and reminds me a lot of Grain Belt.  On tap @ Fathers Office L.A.  Clear straw with a one finger white head, creamy with fair retention.  Grassy citrus, corn, and pale grain domiante the aroma.  The flavor is much the same, and, despite the sweetness (the big corn and sweet notes almost have me cry out ""diacetyl! , but not quite), manages to pull off a semi-dry finish.  Bitterness peaked @ a 2.  Moderate prickly carbonation with a light body.  Better and more flavorful than a macro, but not by enough for me to want to get this regularly.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

3189,"2009-05-18",3.4,"Draught at Fathers Office.   Without even knowing the commercial description, this beer screamed ""corn"" at my from first sniff.   The thing is, it tastes like if a corny macro lager was actually good.   Cool stuff.   Hoppy, spicy aroma, with sweet corn and a fruity, yeasty element.   The flavor has sweet corn, grainy bread and a medium-bitter, hoppy finish.   Higher carbonation fits the style but is a bit much.   A pretty interesting beer, but maybe not up to a great pils with the same craftsmanship.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

Aromas show a light hop element, some bready malt, light corn sweetness, very very low levels of DMS. Clean yeast wise. Flavors show a light fruit note, low hops and sweet bready, malty, cornbread.
