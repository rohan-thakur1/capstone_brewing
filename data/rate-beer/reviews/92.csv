Hints of sweet roast, tequila, light chocolate, and oddly enough, beans.

Not sure if its the chilies or the carbonation, but its a bit lively on the palate, and its a bit sticky too.

92,"2013-02-01",4.0,"375, capped. Pours black with a dense and creamy tan head. Big sharply frank tequila and sweet roasted peppers on the nose--bitey, in a pleasant way, with tangy oranges and agave knocking around, alongside sweet and forward peppers. Creamy medium body, probably too little carb. This beer likes to mess with you. The mid-palate is peppery and spicy in a phenolic way that turns out to be genuine, and a world completely apart from whats on the nose. Long tangy spicy bell pepper finish. Confusing and fun.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
92,"2013-01-15",4.3,"Bottle from Ølbutikken (Copenhagen, Denmark)
Aroma: Chocolate, salt water, peppers, burnt malt, nail polish, and some booze (presumably from the tequila barrels)
Appearance: Dark brown with a light brown head (although it is quite dark, even for the style)
Taste: Fairly complex taste. Some tartness at first, followed by some booziness, and some coffee in the finish. The peppers linger for a while on the tongue. Definitely a porter base. The tartness surprised me. Reminds me a bit of pickled jalapenos.
Palate: Full bodied, slightly oily texture, and a lively carbonation (at the right temperature its a bit prickly even).
Fantastic. I wish I would have tried the original Mexas Ranger first so that I could compare the two.","Minneapolis, USA","n00bface"
92,"2013-01-05",3.3,"Darkbrown/black and with a nice porterish head. First zip was too coold and all flavours were seperated, felt the tequila at most in the beginning. After a warm up the flavours blended and it was enjoyable. Milder chilitaste than both Mexas and Texas, in my opinion too mild. Tastes a bit sour, malty and definitly more spicy than your average porter.","Malmö, SWEDEN","peterclash"
92,"2012-12-30",3.7,"Bottle. Opaque black liquid with medium, thick tan head. Aroma of spices, smoked chilli, wood, tequila, herbs, coffee and ash. Taste is dry and light to medium bitter with notes of a light chilli burn, wood and herbs. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. OK, but tequilla barrels arent my favourite.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","VsXsV"
