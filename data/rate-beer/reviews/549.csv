549,"2017-06-20",4.0,"Wonderful Belgian. Richer version of the 6. Dark fruits, caramel, brown sugar. Surprising lively carbonation. Dessert aspect of creamy sweetness, but with a dry finish. Excellent stuff.","Georgia, USA","rdixon77"
549,"2017-05-27",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 28, 2017 330ml bottle bought at ICBeer in Kwun Tong.
Looks: Clear ruby brown colour with a thin ring of dirt-like yeast sediments; Two and a quarter finger head with crumpety creamy off-white foam which lasts for 4 minutes; Beautiful sticky lacing with fizzy small carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and sweet dark malt, with strong caramel, strong sticky toffee, strong plums, dark fruits, strong banana, vanilla, cinnamon, floral, candi sugar, cloves, spices, bread, strong Bel yeast and grass. Big and beautiful!

Taste: Medium sweet dark malt, with strong metallic, strong caramel, strong toffee, plums, Cola, floral, strong molasses, spices, strong herbs, light bread, strong Bel yeast, lemon, mid to strong bitter hops and grass.

Body: Full body. Very slick and creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: Solid dark maltyness in a thick background. Very smooth and creamy! Metallic but not nagging, full of rich caramel, toffee and Cola, followed by strong plums and spices. Quite flowery with strong candi sweetness. Very Bel yeasty with expressive herbal bitter hops and ended with strong lemon. Excellent!

Hoppiness: Cinnamon, floral, spices and grass in nose. Floral, spices, strong herbs, lemon, and grass in taste; Bitterness is quite strong for a lasting, high astringent sweet-bitter lean dark malty finish. 

After Taste: Fairly dry. Herbal hoppy and bitter to mouth.

Comments: This is definitely a step up from the already nice Prior 6, with thick body, good looks, big Bel yeasty fruity spicy aroma and a perfectly balanced sweetness and herbal hoppiness. Unlike Westvleteren 8 which is more booze-forwarded, this is all about malty hearty characters, like a little brother of Abt 12. Highly enjoyable!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

549,"2017-04-24",3.9,"(From the keg) Slightly hazy ruby-maroon beer, with a small tan head. Slow, fine carbonation.

Bready malts hit the nose first, then tart wild strawberry, hints of hop bitterness, rich honeycomb, fresh oak, and vanilla.

On the palate, the beer is spicy at first, with a touch of clove, but balanced by the sweetness of the malt, which comes through as fresh bread and crème brûlée. The finish is clean and dry, with a lingering aftertaste of minerals and beeswax.

A smooth medium mouthfeel, which coats the teeth.

This is a well-balanced, complex, and pleasant beer.","North Yorkshire, ENGLAND","victorsampson96"

Taste is surprisingly complex having sweet roasted malt undernotes, brown sugar, some vanilla and bourbon notes, milk chocolate, hot chocolate and hot milk and has a ""fruity"" overall character all over.

549,"2016-09-15",4.2,"This was poured into a chalice.
The appearance was a dark brown color with a fairly quickly dissipating slim fingers worth of white to almost off white foamy head that just slides into oblivion. Extremely thin white lacing gracing the sides of the glass.
The aroma finds some sweet glossy ""iced apple"" roaming into a sly clove spice and then a nice sweet bready maltiness finding itself nicely fitting it and just bringing it all together.
The flavor is bready sweet with the clove slyly moving in underneath. Semi-dry bready with a sly clove-like spice hitting the aftertaste nicely. Barely any finish in this one, but somehow I seem okay with that (yeah, just seems to move super quick).
On the palate, this one sat about a deep light to medium on the body with a sly sessionability to it. It wants to show some ""gulping"" feel to it, but the carb reads the riot act on the sweetness of the breadiness. Okay, hmmmm...yeah, Ill just say it feels spectacular.

549,"2015-05-27",3.7,"11.2 oz bottle, poured into an oversized wine glass at ~50 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a deep red-brown like burnished mahogany, and forms a thick head of just barely off-white, which lingers a bit ere dwindling to a cap and ring. Lacing is nonexistent.

Smell: Redolent with a variety of fruits, from raisin and plum to cherry and fig, with hints of currant as well. Belgian candi sweetness underlies the fruit aromas, like a mattress of cotton candy buoying the orchard upwards.

Taste: In contrast to the fruity nose, the taste opens with a serious wallop of dark bread, which is accompanied by both a rush of alcohol heat and a slurry of faint, mingled stone fruits. This persists through the middle, and at the finish, the alcohol falls away to reveal a beautiful caramel-toffee bread soaked in raisin and currant preserves and served up on a plate of leather. At times, a metallic tinge swims through the beer, coppery and harsh.

Mouthfeel: Incredibly fizzy and prickly, this somehow remains full and sticky. Theres enough carbonation to lend a sharpness to the entire tasting process.

Overall: I actually get far more noticeable alcohol heat out of the Prior 8 than the Abt 12, likely due to the reduced punch of the malt and yeast profiles. This is not even in my top 3 beers from St. Bernardus.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

He brought me a medium flavor tempered pulling the same and so salty, I could see a slight memory of a brandy because it is volatile and appears just in taste. Alcohol is noticed in the heat that transmits the throat.
Long end she is malted reducing cabornatado taste and formatting a very soft palate between good bitterness and light caramel.
Medium complexity high is strong and powerful and full-bodied beer just right.

Aroma of bitter chocolate, molasses, raisins, dried plums, grass, leather, straw, iron, black pepper, dried banana, caramel, bourbon, soapy hops, nutmeg and quite strong liquorice. Taste begins with a refinedly sweet, dried fruitiness, raisins, dried banana again, apple, medium but still minerally carbonation, slick and slightly oily mouthfeel, deep caramelly and somewhat nutty and chocolatey malts, lots of spicy yeastiness in an elegant way, dry finish with grassy, leafy European hops along with the chocolate maltiness lingering on and a warming, whisky-like alcohol effect, on the brink of becoming wry but just managing to avoid that. Another great Sint-Bernardus, relating to its bigger brother in much the same way as Westvleteren 8 relates to Westvleteren 12: leaner, lighter, more dry and a tad more restrained, with a less attacking bouquet. Still a great beer in which malts, hops and yeastiness are balanced to perfection. I will do a side-by-side tasting of this with Westvleteren 8 soon, and Ill do the same thing with Sint-Bernardus Abt 12 and Westvleteren 12 the same day. Do not (completely) believe the people who tell you this is an easy-to-find alternative for Westvleteren 8: though the similarities are striking, this still is a great beer in its own right, and I am quite convinced I can tell the two apart in a blind tasting.

549,"2014-07-26",3.8,"Transfer from BA review on 8-8-12 - 
 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass
 Appearance  Served a medium deep reddish-brown color with a light haze and a one finger white head. The head faded over time to give a medium level of lacing.
 Smell  The aroma is heaviest of dark fruit aromas of prune, raisin, fig, and some cherry. These sweeter fruit flavors are also complimented by some aromas of a bready malt as well as some molasses. Overall the aroma is sweet and delicious.
 Taste  The taste begins more on the maltier side with hints of a roasted malt and brown bread. These flavors quickly sweeten as the dark fruit flavors that were detected in the nose come to the tongue. These tastes are mixed with a caramel and molasses flavor which greatly sweeten the profile. At the end of the taste, some boozy and vanilla flavors meet the tongue and take the taste to the end.
 Mouthfeel- The body of the beer is on the slightly higher side with some nice creaminess and has a carbonation level being just below average.
 Overall  A tasty brew, but in comparison to its bigger brother 12 it is nothing to really pine for. For the dubbel style it is more towards the top of the line, but not the best out there (at least in my opinion)","","Darkmagus82"

As wonderful as all the yuletide beer releases are, theres really no reason to look further than Prior 8, if you want to taste Noel in a bottle. A nose packed with stewed fragrances ranging from fruity through spicy and bready to things like the pleasant body odor one might find on a love interest. The taste reflects, with great balance, depth, and persistence, the nose. What Id most like to convey is the drunk-vs-drinkability factor which is off the charts.

549,"2013-12-04",3.8,"Trying to relive the Westvleteren 8's I had at In De Vrede on two occasions last summer. 

Overflowed out of the bottle a touch. Poured into a Westmalle glass with a tight, white head. Deep cola brown and a gentle lacing too. 

Smells of raisins and yeast. 

The taste starts with the same raisin sweetness, but also adds some sherry and a sour-apple-y Belgian yeast character.

Quite spritzy on the mouth. 

Overall, Brune's have never been my favourite style...more of a poor man's strong dark and Quad, but this does bring a bright, candi sugar quality to the equation which gives it its own quality.

Obviously many will want to compare this to the Abt 12, but it is quite a different beast. The first thing that strikes me is the sweetness, not in a bad way, this beer is well balanced, but you certainly notice the candy sugar, and what I would assume is a lengthy boil. Chocolatey toffee notes that cling to the back of the palate. No hops noticeable as one would expect.

Overall, this is an exceptional double, that is really quite unique. Certainly worth hunting out, in my opinion, and whilst different from the Abt 12 (surly a good thing), this is none the less exceptional.","","john_henry"

Pours a nearly clear dark brown with a rock solid one finger light tan head that refuses to go away. Tons of carbonation maintains the head nearly throughout with huge globs of lacing clinging to the sides of the glass.

There is a huge clove and banana Belgian aroma along with some light hints of dark fruits and coriander. Really pleasant and inviting.

The flavor is a wonderful marriage of dark caramel, figs, raisins, and dried cranberries. More coriander, clove, and banana that becomes especially prominent towards the finish. Mouthfeel is pretty dry with just a slight stickyness that is on par for the style.

Overall, a wonderful Dubbel with perfectly melded but very in your face flavors. Every St. Bernardus beer I have had has blown me away and this ones proves no different.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

smell: Has a medicinal smell to it combined with caramel, dark fruits and licorice.

taste: A little odd. It has some contradicting flavors somehow. I get caramel, brown sugar with a spicy smokey licorice finish. Its interesting but it doesnt really seem to click somehow. After some lingering i get fig as an after taste. I get a lot of medicinal phenol flavors together with alcohol in the nose, which adds to the slightly weird flavor combo.

 Dunkelbraun, ziemlich trüb, ein paar Schwebeteilchen sind auch sichtbar, nicht so dolle Optik. Leicht hefig-säuerlich und malzig im Aroma. Der Antrunk ist für 8% Alk. eher verhalten; geschmacklich kommt eine Pumpernickelnote ""bittersweet"" vor. Das war´s dann aber schon. Aromenarm und langweilig; die deutlich alkoholische Note im leicht herberem Abgang trägt auch nicht zur Bekömmlichkeit bei. Insgesamt für ein belgisches Abteibier doch sehr enttäuschend.

Poured into my Westmalle bowl glass it looks a lovely ruby red, deep and clean appearance. The beige head stayed for the whole experience, which I always like to see.

Plum pudding and christmas cake mix come to mind in the aroma, but it isnt strong and takes some finding. Burnt malts also in there somewhere.

The taste knocks spots off the 6.7% Pater 6 which is what I had prior to this (see how I did that?). This beer tastes like its aroma, plums, dried fruits (like found in a Christmas cake), malty, toasty and roasted.

Feels good, nicely balanced beer, the flavours stay and the beer is obviously well crafted.

le verre, oui. Mais rien ne le dit sur létiquette, elle est juste présentée comme une bière dabbaye. 
Donc bière dabbaye faite par un brasseur de la ""belgian family brewers""
et qui sappelle Prior. La première peut être une double, mais cest un long débat qui nous entraînerait trop loin...
Couleur brun sombre roux, dans le style dun Porto tawny.
Clarté pure (si on met la levure à part, comme toujours)
Pétillant : bien, sans excès (et la mienne est à date au 8/4/2015).
Arômes de prune, poire mûre, figue, mûre et une pointe de myrtille.
Première bouche superbe sur les fruits susdits et les céréales. Légère
nuance dun porto de classe.
Deuxième nez dun grand brassin, sur les raisins et les dattes.
Deuxième bouche de très beaux pruneaux dAgen.
Troisième nez riche et capiteux.
Troisième bouche avec des nuances variées, mais de grande classe, 
avec des pointes darmagnac de Ténarèze et de cognac fins bois.
Longueur avec un bel équilibre des saveurs, et une pointe damertume.
Levure de bonne facture, soyeuse et un rien vineuse.
Alcool bien dosé,  sans prise excessive.
Finale dans la grande aventure dune bière de catégorie supérieure.
Beaucoup de classe, du caractère, peu de sucre, des nuances qui se 
précisent à la suite lune de lautre, et en arrière bouche.
Du style, de la brillance et pourquoi pas une maîtrise qui appartient souvent à dautres domaines de la gastronomie, pour ne pas nommer 
le vin, qui sy croit souvent un peu trop, et ferait bien de regarder sa petite
soeur la bière....

549,"2012-02-21",3.8,"From notes.  First reviewed 4/15/2009.  Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a goblet.

Prior 8 has a thick, walnut brown color that is impossible to see through. I observed small sentiment floating around the edges before disappearing into the brown abyss, with some residue from the last drops resting on top of the lace hat looks like cinnamon. The head foams up nicely to about 4 cm. Eventually it fades, but some head and loose lacing remain around the beer for the duration of the glass. 

A developed but nuanced smell, the major players are a strong Belgian yeasty malt and some fall spices. Cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg are all noticeable. Dates and raisins round out the aroma. 

Nothing too surprising here, although the dark fruit takes more of the lead. A strong, pleasant, yeasty malt dominates up front. Only a hint of the spices I smelled find their way into the taste. A light, somewhat tart hop flavor comes in at the end of the sip, but its not quite citrusy. I think it is a light starfruit taste.

A medium bodied, smooth feel. A nice level of carbonation, and there is a level of sediment that is nice.

This is a very drinkable beer. The strong, dark flavor and high alcohol content make it a nice sipper.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

549,"2011-09-04",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 20, 2013 Aroma: Smells remarkably like Westvleterens beers. They (and this beer in front of me) have this very strange floral sweetness to them, along with a smooth caramel malt scent and backed with lots of dark fruit.

In fact its right up there along with a nasty fart you laid that makes your entire group of beer buddies leave the room.

Appearance: 750 into Abdij St. Sixtus Trappist glass. All sorts of brown/red hues with a huge, creamy fine off-white head and lacing galore. Supreme.

Huge, frothy, tan head which stuck around to the end - nice.Aroma: similar to a red wine, but not as strong. Surprisingly mild. Fruity. Touch of alcohol in the nose.Taste: This beer started out strong with a robust and complex palate of dark fruit (cherry, plum, fig) and even a bittersweet chocolate which was an pleasant surprise. Creamy texture, too. However, as it warmed it seemed to thin out and become watery and bland. Thats the opposite Id expect from a Belgian bottle-condition beer. Mouthfeel: not very intense, but much more mild than a Belgian should be. Seems to thin out the more I drink.Drinkability: rather low. This beer is so effervescent its hard not to burp every 2 seconds. Overall: Started out loving this beer, but it just couldnt go the whole nine yards. Ill split the difference and call it good.

On the nose, there are big notes of molasses and liquorice, along with toasted malt, raisins, flowers, vanilla and a hint of spice. The flavour is moderately sweet up front, with notes of raisins, molasses, herbs and flowers. It dries a little towards the finish, which is long and malty. On the palate, it is medium-full in body with a smooth, milky texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice dubbel; it is a bit lighter than some, but it is fairly complex.

A - Murky chestnut brown to a dark, murky tawny color. Slight reddish tint. Large, foamy, bubbly, and off-white with a slight beige hue. A bit below average retention and some spotty lacing left.

S - Strong dark and citrus fruit smell along with some dark malt aroma in the background. Well spiced with cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, coriander, and a bit of pepper. Also strong Belgian yeast smell and some dark candi sugar. Nice complex aroma, with typical Dubbel aroma with a bit more spice.

T - Follows the nose pretty well. Initially there is a lot of malt and dark candi sugar. Then the dark fruit starts to come out more. Then, bam, a load of spices (same as the nose) comes through. The finish is a nice mix of rum soaked dark fruit and spices with a nice background of malt and dark sugar. Belgian yeast flavors is also fairly present throughout the sip.

M - Slightly more than medium body with a bit more than average carbonation. Quite smooth with a tingly and warming finish.

D - Good drinkability. Complex flavors that dont kill your palate. The spice might be a little strong, but it isnt bad for drinkability.

Poured from an 11.2 oz. bottle into a chalice. The bottle was dated as cellarable through October 15, 2013, which suggests that the beer had been brewed in fall 2008. The age on this may account for the flavor, which featured restrained, mellow stone fruits and a hint of very dark honey. Bottle conditioning yielded a tremendous head and an extremely pleasant creamy texture in the mouth. A real winner, as expected from a fine brewery.","Athens, Georgia, USA","bjt512"
549,"2010-03-29",4.1,"Most revered for their Abt. 12, St. Bernardus also brews a handful of other equally praise-worthy beers. Riding the middle of the abbey road is the Prior 8, a rich Belgian dubbel of epic quaffing proportions, no easy feat indeed considering its generous palate and ABV.


She pours like melted milk chocolates into my chalice, settling luxuriously under a soft khaki head. Light tinges the bottom and sides of my glass with russet-hues, browns, and rich ambers. Playfully swirling her head releases a rich nose moist with dark fruits and a tinge of tartness. Raisins, black plums, black cherries, and pumpernickel whisper amongst each other while I dip my nose once more. Vanilla bean and licorice root parry with fresh cinnamon sticks, and I waste no time wrapping my lips around hers. Sweet and tinged with unripe tartness, just as her nose promised. Gliding over my tongue like velvet, black plums and raisins swim in a river of gentle molasses. Her finish tickles and tingles while warm chewy pumpernickel gives weight and breadth to her naturally effervescent body. Bitter plum skins nip at the back of my throat even as more rich dark sweetness pervades her already seductive palate. Her sweetness is not the least bit cloying, and as black cherries marry into melted chocolate, beervana comes full circle. Each quaff is a pleasant menagerie of all the above, and the more she warms, the more she opens up.


The Prior 8 is truly a beer to sup and savor for a good long while; plenty of time to shake free from the shackles of shyness and open her heart, body, and soul for you and me. St. Bernardus never fails to impress and satisfy my oft-times discriminating and sometimes exhausted palate. I know that every time I bring home one of their abbey beers, I am in for a wonderful treat. Sometimes life does offer us unbridled guarantees of joy and happiness; St. Bernardus is one of those.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

549,"2009-07-30",3.9,"St. Bernardus Prior 8 is a dim, cloudy, leathery brown ale with a big, fluffy, light beige head that leaves tenacious lacing.  It has a grainy, bready aroma with notes of raisin and prune.  It smells just a touch sweet.  Its medium, maybe medium-light, bodied, smooth and fluffy and quite bubbly with a clean finish.  There are dark and dried fruit flavors; notes of apple, plum, cherry and raisin bread.  Its not very sweet-- almost savory, with no noticeable bitterness.  Its warming at the finish and has a clean aftertaste.  Very tasty.","Fairport, New York, USA","yesyouam"

549,"2008-06-16",4.4,"Single bottle enjoyed in a medium sized snifter. Slow pour producing a cloudy, mahogany colored body with a billowing khaki head. I was able to pour the rest of the bottle into the glass after a considerable wait. The rocky head sticks around providing a bunch of stringy/streaky lacing. I swirled gently to help release the aroma, and what a lovely aroma it is. A rich fruitiness filled the air, very strong and welcoming. Vinous with a light red wine quality accompanied by scents of plums and licorice. Medium bodied on the palate and velvety smooth. The alcohol is barely noticed and there is a succinct fruity aftertaste. Flavor resembles the aroma, but has a little different complexity to it. Sweet doughy malts similar to fresh baked goods. Raisins, figs, and plums with a small nuance of orange zest. A friendly port wine quality similar with other well crafted Belgians. A hint of spices similar to clove, ginger, and coriander.

Decent malty finish, but as a very late finish theres also a glorious nuttiness. Superb beer. Belgian ale at its finest.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
549,"2008-03-08",3.5,"Bottle. The aroma is sweet, fruity with notes of plums - a pretty complex aroma. The color is a deep red and it has a small beige head though fast disappearing. The flavor is sweet and rich in fruit; plums, raisins, and prunes. The alcohol tickles the tongue which combines with the bitterness into a dry end. It has a good palate which in combination with the alcohol makes it rather vinous.","Birmingham, Alabama, USA","CaptBier"

549,"2008-02-22",3.9,"33cl. bottle: Dark chestnut brown with red highlights. A long lasting, rich, creamy light tan head sits proudly on top. Immediately upon opening the bottle your nose detects sugar (of the dark syrup variety), some roasted malt, and some wood. Not exactly a ""wood-aged"" character but something musty, woody, with a touch of green. A touch of alcohol back there someplace and possibly also a pinch of licorice. On the tongue you first notice cookie dough. This moves into sugar and some dark, but not quite roasted, malts. A touch of raisin and low plum adds a nice fruit touch. Throughout the entire taste is some green-wood that adds astringency which helps the hops balance the sweetness. Dark sugars, alcohol and green-wood take you through the finish. Always a hit.","Brasschaat, BELGIUM","CapedBrewsader"

This however doesnt help me to understand how even though the bottle says Dubbel right on it, Ratebeer has it in the Belgian Strong Ale category. Anyway, I do enjoy the balance of the Westmalle more, while this is very close to an abt with a saner alcohol content, and if I wanted a bigger beer, Id go with this.

I let this beer warm for a bit hoping more of the aroma would come out in the flavor.

The smell erupts with sweet doughy malts and dark fruits, classic dubbel aroma, very enticing. 

Breadiness juxtaposed with fig, raisin, and plum esters caresses the tongue. A hint of spiciness, caramel, and candi sugar make this a sweet beer while a pinch of hop flavor and alcohol warmth fight for balance.

Wow, this beer has some head on it! Towering rocky white head, very crystalline in appearance. Slow to recede, and leaves excellent lacing. It takes a while to see enough of the body to tell the true color, which turns out to be  a very dark purple, almost red wine type color. Nose of white grapes, candied sugars, cherries, funky/musty yeast, bread dough and peppery spice. Bright fruits, sugars and yeasts continue to dominate into the flavor profile. Very wine like all the way around, really, from appearance to flavor. Some spice kicks up at the last instant. Medium-heavy astringency.

549,"2007-11-03",3.9,"First impression it that like other St. Bernardus beers, this is very well crafted.  While it is not as complex as the Abt 12, this is a special ale that stands on its own.  The nose is dark fruit, sugar, with slight vinous accents.  The flavor is rich complex, and slightly more refined than the nose, while at the same time keeps one wanting more.  I will no doubt repeat this beer, and it maybe often, while supplies last.","Wilmington, North Carolina, USA","Ansset13"

Just lovely to look at. Flavorwise it starts with a sweet, caramel and dried fruits, soon followed by some cellar, yeast and warming alcohol. A little peppery spicyness as well. It finishes quite sweet, with dried fruits, a reasonable amount of alcohol, and a spicyness. When pouring the rest of the bottle into my glass, it turns out the before so clear body, now is hazy, and with some micro-floaties. As expected.

549,"2007-08-08",5.0,"This is by far my favorite of all the St. Bernardus beers, and quite simply the best dubbel (if thats what it is) that I have ever tasted. The ABT 12 is almost perfect but just a bit too sweet, the tripel is great but several tripels are greater (say, Westmalle). The Prior 8 in contrast has no bad qualities I have been able to discern and no other beer has it beat in any respect. It is a very substantial, vinous beer. In fact, I have never tasted a beer that was so similar to a wine before. We have here the aroma of prunes, raisins, various fruit, and yeast. Caramel is very pronounced, but whats remarkable about the Prior 8 is that it manages to be caramel-y without being sweet (here the ABT 12 falls short). We have here plenty of carbonation and appropriate hop bitterness--the hops are definitely more pronounced than in most Belgian dark ales of this strength, and yet the beer is not bitter; its just very well balanced. ""Dry"" is the word, not ""bitter"". Another respect in which the 8 is superior to any comparable beer I can think of is that it manages to be quite dark and caramel-like without even a hint of roasty/burnt flavor (what some people call ""coffee"" or ""chocolate""). In this respect I find it preferable to the comparable Rochefort (viz. 8, or 10 for that matter).","Montreal, Quebec, USA","Juhani"

Malty, fruity aroma with lots of candy sugar, and some caramel, vanilla, cinnamon - like speculaas cookiedough;  that peculiar St. Bernardus yeastiness. Well-rounded malty taste, with notes of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, speculaas cookies, ginger, cinnamon; a spectacular interplay of malt- and yeast-complexity. Long finish, coffee-like (moccha), deeply malty. Some hop-bitterness  in the finish, which provides a nicely dry edge. Thick, but not too heavy on the palate, with subdued carbonation. Less intense but overall more rounded & balanced than the Abt12. The excellent price/quality ratio, plus the reasonable ABV% makes this one of the best beers I know.","Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","iep"

Poured the Prior 8 into its very own St. Bernardus goblet. Poured a murky deep dark brown/garnet with yeast sediment even after a careful pour. A one finger head off white head sat on top that faded to a thin cap rather quickly. The body is loaded with small sediment. It does look inviting though like there is going to be all kinds of flavors coming through.

The smell has a lot of fruitiness to it. Figs and prunes come to mind first. An earthy mustiness comes through barely noticeable along with an old and slightly leathery quality. The backbone of this beer is a lightly toasted bread aroma. All this goes very nicely together.

The flavor is where its at. There is a very noticeable sweetness but its layer upon layer of flavors that casue this sweetness. The dark fruits come through first. Prune and fig just like in the nose sprinkled with some brown sugar. The earthiness comes next with must and a dark old leathery taste. All going very nicely together I must add. As I type this I notice its the exact same as the aroma but without the toasted bread. Its more along the lines of dough. I even get hints of chocolate as I sip. Finishes with a candy sweetness. Really nicely made.

Mouthfeel is key on this beer as well. Its very creamy and as it slides along my mouth, right before the swallow, it turns almost to froth. Fits very well with all the other aspects. The body is coating.

Drinkability is good. Its an easy one to put away. I cant drink too much of any Belgian but this is an easy one to do so. 

Another wonderfully made beer from St. Bernardus. An easy drinker for sure and one I will enjoy over and over.

Full and smooth on the tongue.  The flavors are very vinous.  Big ass grape.  Big sweet malt.  This almost reminds me of some renditions of scotch ales.  Not the type of scotch ale rendition I generally enjoy, but this is really very much better.  Creamy big sweet malt.  Even a bit of diacetyl, which is strange for a Belgian, but it seems appropriate here.  Very fruity, big grape, berry, and dark fruit.  Some light toast.  A little acid in the surprisingly dry slightly buttery finish.  The lingering slight tartness of a Belgian in the aftertaste is accompanied by toast.

The aroma picked up dried berries and vinous notes with a pinch of dust and some roasty caramel.. only complaint is that the dust got a little in the way at times... really good, though.  The flavor was even better.. toasty caramel, molasses, and vinous fruits form a formidable flavor core with brilliant accents of dusty, peppery spices from the heavy yeast presence and some alcohol warmth.

I taste a slightly bitter caramel flavor, but as I stated it doesnt even reach its maximum potential as the Abt 12 does. The Abt 12 opens up on your tongue and leaves a flavor that one can taste.

549,"2007-02-17",3.9,"11.2 oz. bottle. Pours a slightly hazy ruddy orange-brown color. Produces a beautiful huge, fluffy and rocky tan head which maintains a 1/4"" thickness throughout the glass. Quite intense and pleasant aromas of fresh baked wheat rolls, yeast, ripe pears/apples, caramel candies, toffee along with faint hints of buckwheat honey, spices, charred oak and alcohol. Palate is full and round combining a nice spritzy carbonation with an enjoyable chewy texture. Flavor profile seems a bit more reserved compared to the aroma, but still quite good. Notes of sweet Belgian crystal malts, light brown sugar, caramel, toffee, spices, fresh dark wheat bread and ripe light fruits are savored. Finish shows just a quick hit of hops and alcohol, but unfortunately tends to fade out fast leaning toward some thiness in the end. All in all a well done Belgain Dubble and would certainly visit this again.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

While appropriately dark for a dubbel, Im just not that into the coca-cola brown yielded by dark candi sugar--as opposed to the roasted malts of a porter or stout. Moreover, unlike the thick contrasting color that can make a dark pint of Guiness so attractive, the head was very thin, although persistent.

The strong aroma and dark color leads one to expect a full-bodied, malty sweet meal in a glass. But this beer is instead very dry and subdued on the palate--too subdued for my taste.

Alcohol begins to show even as it holds a chill. A caramel presence indicates that this will be a nice bridge between Pater 6 and the ""bigger"" Bernardus beers. A sip, and... yes! Malts showcase prominently sweet in the flavor. (I was worried after my recent tasting of ""6"" which held a malt profile that was full yet boring.) Cararmel, spices and berries mingle within a fluffy palate, but a latent stickiness keeps them from drifting too far away. Sweetness turns sour in the aftertaste, lingering as a childrens cough syrup with mild alcohol and fruitiness. All in all this is an excellent beer which makes me glad that I purchased the Bernardus ""gift set"" for myself on a whim.

Consumed: October 2011
Not a lot to report in terms of development from the lasting of 14 months ago. Continues to be in good nick although the malt is fading. Big whack of funky vegemite on the nose. I have one bottle left and there will be very little risk hanging onto it to drink 2 years past the BB date. Massive ice-cream floater head, good lacing. Brown in colour with a red tinge, a little cloudy.  Savoury, earthy malts, some raisens, but a little subdued.  More thick raiseny notes on the palate with sugary malts. Some spice and fruit as well. A little heat doesnt detract. Pretty good stuff.

Probably about 3 years old. Holding up well if a little unspectacular. Shows all the usual dubbel traits and also has a nice, albeit it mild, chocolate overlay.

Raisins, sultanas and all manner of dry, savoury dessert-style fruits leap from the glass. Lightly spicy with a decent balance of woody and doughy yeast, and a late addition of banana that seemed a little odd. Quite dry and almost pasty in the mouth, full in body and smooth like a thick dessert sauce. Flavours of crushed cashews and almonds add an almost woody edge to notes of powdered cocoa, dried out garden herbs and softer dried fruits that manage to fill every nook-and-cranny of the mouth. Finish is long and malty dry with a light warming sensation to remind me of its ABV. Took a long time to finish which I find the best part of the St. Bernardus beers, they just fill that need for quantity.

Muddled brown hue with a big frothy off-white head and very good lace. The aroma has notes of candi and brown sugar, caramel malt, earthy yeast, sublime caradmom and pipe tobacco. The taste starts sugary sweet with a mighty malt backbone. Follows with a hint of dark fruits, moderate peppery spices, wild grains and hints of whisky. The finish has some dryness and subdued bitters. The feel is sharp and moderately lush with some alcohol presence. A well crafted brew and has some good taste. Beer geek worthy.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

549,"2005-04-13",3.8,"Thick head and long-lasting lacing as expected of any artisan brew. Clean, bready aroma. Flavor is fundamentally vivid yet shows little depth -- the basic yeasty malty forefront is there with maybe a touch of unripe strawberry, toffee-mint and nutmeg. Alcohol prevalent in the mouth which tickles the tongue sort of like a sloe gin. Just a tad of hops come through in the flavor but even more so in the finish, sort of a change of pace having drunk more tripels than dubbels in the past. In addition, finish is like raisin pie. Nice bubbles in the mouth but slightly thin; still, Prior 8 has that liquid bread fillingness in the gut that has kept many a monk on ""Cloud 9"" during fasting time. This may not be one of the better batches but overall its a good dubbel with potential.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","BeerAteHer"

The appearance is only the beginning of this beauty.  The aroma is of red apples, currants and slight spice.  The flavor is just like the 12 (chocolate, caramel, spice, blood, cloves, apple), with a little less body. The creaminess of the head is unique to the carbonated parts, as the remaining body is a tad thin and watery.

The head poured average, off-white, and frothy/fizzy, and it diminished somewhat slowly until it was small (but not gone).  In the glass, it was a transluscent amber-yellow, and looked nicely refreshing, with the aroma still in mind.  The taste I didnt find to be sweet at all, with a subtle malt flavor in the back of the tounge and moderate acidity all around.  The finish began slightly sour (which I enjoyed), and then evened out and lingered for an average amount of time (although I couldnt identify it as either hoppy or malty).  At the very end, it became a bit metallic, but not obtrusively so.  It wasnt dry, was mostly watery, and the only very noticable thing was the very lively carbonation.  As I said, this one seemed very simple to me, and perhaps my palate isnt developed enough to pick up a whole bunch of subtle flavor.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Nice sweet alchohol scent... not too overpowering... some fruitiness in there too.

This one is odd... first sip I was thinking, ""Hmm, a bit too harsh and fake."" But the second sip is when I truly tasted the complexity. Starts out with a sweet fruity apple, or similar fruit, and gets progressively bitter, finishing with an creamy chocolatey/coffee taste.

Loud pop releases the cork, satisfying hiss of carbonation escaping from the bottle. Poured out a murky, cloudy reddish - brown color, with a huge off-white head. It leaves a more than decent lacing down the sides of the glass. Thick, yeasty matting on top of the beer itself. Aromas are of candi sugar, dark malts, slight caramel, toasted bread, and Belgian yeast. Tastes are of caramelized sugars, Pilsner malts, and Noble hops. Spicy hop bite to it, and a decent maltiness as well. Mouthfeel is slightly thinnish.

There are undertones of fruit in the aroma as well.  Definitely spicy tasting as well, finishes a bit hot.  This beer definitely features what Belgian yeast can do.  Lots of yeast character here.  There is a subtle malty sweetness that helps to carry the complex yeast flavors and aromas.  The spice notes from the yeast that I can differentiate are; ginger, pepper, bergamot, and cardamom.  This beer is medium bodied, though, as many Belgian beers are, it is quite light for its alcohol content.

Big malt taste leads the attack followed by slightly sour fruit, raisin, peach, spicy peppery alcohol.  Assertive bitterness keeps the sweetness in check.  Strong effervescent bottle conditioning also helps lighten the feel of the big-bodied beer, lifting that flavor right into your palette whilst softening the mouthfeel. Complex and tasty.

Brown in color with a red hue, the head is tan and lasts from start to finish, though it diminishes slightly.  The aroma is yeasty/doughy with a tartness that balances out the bread yeast - a bit of alcohol is evident as well.  The beer's flavor exhibits quite a bit of alcohol with a sweetness of fruits and some nutty goodness as well.  The beer itself was an interesting concept, but a bit too strong - quite a bit of alcohol and a bit too sweet as well.  An impressive beer, but not one of my faves.Quick Re-rate:The beer gets surprisingly better as it gets warmer - perhaps just a tad bit too cold at the start, the full complexity of the beer was not blended well.  As it gets warmer, the flavors all blend together beautifully as it becomes much easier to drink with a flavoring of alcohol that is not quite as strong.

549,"2003-04-19",3.8,"A curious beer that meets many of my expectations but proves disappointing in a few respects.  It pours with a slightly-looser than idea head (not creamy though moderately small bubbles).  The body is cloudy brown, though an off-brown through the light.  The aroma is the strong suitlovely flavors jumping out, raisin and bubblegum, but also caramel, vinous and sweet.  The flavor is surprisingly more dry with a particularly salty note that was the biggest disappointment to my tongue, not to mention a hint of chicken fajitas.  The palate remains vigorous, in part because of the tongue-curdling saltiness but also because of continuing zinging carbonation.  In the end, it is bold enough and lively enough to be an enjoyable beer-hunting experience, but not quite the well-rounded composition of the top tier of Belgians.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
549,"2003-04-10",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 20, 2007 Bottle... This beer rocks!...
It has a forbidding murky copper hue and a large, rocky & creamy khaki-colored head. The head is everlasting and leaves excellent, thick lacework on the glass.
The aroma is incredible and complex. Moderately malty & hoppy and very yeasty. Notes of dark bread dough, butter, English toffee, milk chocolate, herbs, flowers, grass, alcohol, lye soap, earth, mildew, dark raisins, cask-aged tawny port and alcohol. Underneath it all is a very small note of cola.
The flavor is very rich and malty with bursts of warm alcohol and buttery caramel up front. EXTREMELY WELL BALANCED with just the right amount of bitter and pungent hops, warm alcohol and a prunish, slightly tart combo on the backside. The flavor and balance reminds me a lot of Westvleteren Extra 8. Full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and slightly lively carbonation.
Long, acrid, dry finish with a shot of clover and caramel at the wee end.
Thanks go out to Britt Rife in Annapolis for this one. Thanks!!!
Excellent beer!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

The alcohol is not nearly as apparent in the flavor as the aroma would have indicated.  Flavor complexity increases exponentially as it warms, as can be expected.

549,"2003-02-27",4.2,"Hazy brown beer with a fantastic long lasting off white head.  Dark fruit(plums and raisins) and malty aroma; followed by buttery(diacetyl) and slightly alcohol aromas; Cloves, yeast, and pepper also present, and with a slight banana ester.  Very malty and alcoholic flavored, with the darker fruits behind the scene.  The flavor is more peppery than cloves from a phenolic standpoint, but both are apparent but not overwhelming adding to complexity;  Some yeastiness also shows as it warms.  Very well balanced but slightly on the dry side as a finish and very clean aftertaste.  Alcohol is warming, not burning; higher carbonation, although not as high as other Belgian styles, seems to lighten the medium body.  At least is seems to be medium bodied, not full like the commercial description.  Very nice overall mouthfeel, not harsh or astringent and very drinkable.  In my opinion, this is the best St. Bernardus I've had of the 3 I've rated, but I do have to re rate one.  I would say this is a dubbel rather than a strong ale, but very nicely made.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

549,"2002-08-23",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2006 Deep amber brown, generous head. Toffee and malt, a hint of spice, really delicate, amazingly soft on the palate, like drinking liquid marshmallow.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Linc"
549,"2002-08-16",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2004 Dark red with a medium head. Aroma: sweet, malty and a bit sour. Taste: Medecine, maybe some chocolate and some port. Like the Pater 6 this comes close to the noble trappists. A very good beer.","Mol, BELGIUM","Kåstå"
549,"2002-07-17",3.3,"Nothing much to say about this. Very little nose. Dark amber beer that smells like a pighouse according too my notes. Resampling anyone?","Solna Stockholm, SWEDEN","DrBeer"
549,"2002-06-24",3.8,"Slightly flat, but a very black beer. The lovely fruit and malt combination makes this beer flavoursome and palatable.","Leicestershire, ENGLAND","RichardGretton"

549,"2002-06-16",3.8,"Malt and liquorice in the aroma. Sweetish taste with a hint of roasted malt. Liquorice, chocolate and blackcurrant. Bit tart. It is not the real Westy, but it will certainly do as a substitute.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
549,"2002-06-10",3.8,"Very dark and brown.  Mine was clearly a bit shaken as it was really lively when i opened it.  A lovely smell, not too strong of alcohol - which is the same with its taste.  IIts really smooth, and easy to drink.It has loads of malts, with tastey sweetness.  Cant wait to try the other versions.","Leicestershire, ENGLAND","neilrichards"
549,"2002-05-02",3.7,"Dark ruby port-wine hazy colour with medium mid size beige moderately well lasting head. A real smorgasbord of an aroma - sweet nectar, esters, glue aromatics, old port wine, tropical fuits and yeasty cured meats. Flavour is bitter-sweet doughy-yeast and fainter sweet cider and molasses. Palate starts bitter, then sweet, medium to full bodied with a rather weak sweet bitter finish. An interesting beer and one I found quite hard to rate and one that I think would change markedly with temperature. Possibly could even be called a desert beer. Overall for me the Abt 12 definitely, and the Pater 6 probably, are both better.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","OlJuntan64"
549,"2002-01-24",3.6,"Well, another beer perhaps ruined by the disturbance of yeast when cap was opened.  My westveletern did this to me last time.  It opened with a nice pfft and yeast came rushing to the top.  therefore making it impossible to get a dregless pour.  The bottle hadnt been disturbed for months so that is not an issue.  My opinion of this brewery is slowly diminishing.  I love the Triple but the 6 and the 8 are bogey.  I am sure the Abt 12 will be nice, got that coming here soon.  This just tasted too dag gone similar to the 6; just a little more beefy.  Rummy nose as Oakes put it, with raisins, dates, and alcohol.  I dont care for the hard water in this as I didnt in the 6.  Taste is alcohol, caramel, cocoa and hints of passion fruits.  Sounds better than it really tastes.  Other than I can see it aging well, this is a disappointment.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
549,"2001-11-04",2.7,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2003 Deep brown colour, with lasting head with nice lace. Mollases in the aroma (unpleasant). Sweet malty, with no ""noticeable"" hops, too much sweet fat malts, no balance, like their 12. Supposedly their recipes are the same as westvleteren, well, they are a far way off getting the balance, subltey, flavour and texure right.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
549,"2001-10-04",2.6,"dark brown colour, big creamy head, banana and mango aroma, heavy, oily, very sweet, long disgusting banana aftertaste - almost not finishable","Bienne, SWITZERLAND","Bov"
549,"2000-12-03",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 27, 2008 Muddy light brown, just like the style ought to be.  Figgy, plummy malt-ester depths to the nose, with a hint of alcohol.  Deep dark fruitiness, smooth slightly toffeeish malts and a rich, sticky finish with a splash of alcohol.  Well-balaned...quality brew.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
