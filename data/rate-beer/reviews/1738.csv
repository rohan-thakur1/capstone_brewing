1738,"2014-07-01",3.5,"Pours a darker reddish amber with a thinner white head. The aroma gives a musty impression, which isnt bad at all. It contains plenty of earthy malts and coffee, some smokiness, and hints of caramel. The taste is remains potent in coffee, which is balanced well with a lesser amount of caramel. Mild chocolate as well, while still containing a good amount of earthiness. The aftertaste is coffee and is subtle yet long lasting. This one is medium bodied, with a bit of a thinner, watery texture, with average carbonation. Its pretty good overall, but a little more straightforward and not terribly exciting.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"

Taste is toasty malt with the vegetal coffee that gives a light bitterness. A little residual sweetness. A medium, crisp, carbonated mouthfeel. Satisfies a summertime craving for a stout.

1738,"2014-06-22",4.0,"Pours a beautifully clear garnet tinged mahogany with a small ecru head that settles to a thin film and ring, with little lacing. Aroma of spent coffee beans with a pleasant nuttiness, light roast and dark caramel. Taste has a nice smooth coffee flavor with an underlying nuttiness. Slight roastiness and a molasses sweetness with a hint of burnt character. Finishes semi dry with a little roasty bitterness. Mouthfeel and body ate light with a medium carbonation. I found this to be a very delicious alternative to other coffee beers you find. Its meant to be a warm weather beer and I think they did a wonderful and interesting job going the California Common route. Flavors are complimentary and very well balanced.

The nose was very roasted coffee, some bakers chocolate, and a light malt presence. Medium bodied with good effervescence, my initial impression was ""iced coffee"" before reading any description. Medium hop bitterness built as the beer warmed. Lightly sweet, but didnt notice much flake/creaminess. Finished with a decent astringency and dryness. Not on the steady diet list, but interesting.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
1738,"2013-01-28",4.1,"First off, kudos to Furthermore for their uniquely named beers as this one certainly caught my eye in the mix and match section. This is a beer with 100% fair trade coffee, or as the bottom of the bottle reads A Nicaraguan all-female growers co-op (stop) A lusciously aromatic just coffee roast (stop) Our warm-fermented, cold-lagered cerveza oscura (huh?) Did you understand all that?

It pours a medium brown color with a light brown head. The aroma is mostly coffee to the degree that if we did a blind smell test, you would never guess this was a beer. Overall it is very inviting for the coffee beer lovers. This just might rival some of the best coffee beers that Wisconsin has to offer. 

The taste is smooth yet quite bold. Once again is this beer of coffee? The texture is very much like a beer but the coffee flavoring overpowers the malts and hops. It is quite unique as you usually only see coffee used in stouts and porters instead of an American lager. It leaves behind a mild coffee after taste. 

This was a pretty interesting find. Its not something I am going to want all the time, but it is certainly a well made, good tasting brew. The creativity to put coffee into a lager was a good choice as this turned out to be a pretty damn good coffee beer especially since Im not a coffee drinker. Keep up the good work Furthermore.

Tastes good, not great, with a very brisk coffee flavor that moves along  a little too quickly to benefit the dark lager.  Mild bitterness on the finish, but the lagery-sweet fade isnt very pleasant, showing off why corn should never be used in beer.

1738,"2012-04-03",3.7,"Pours dark, slightly hazy amber with a 2 finger, creamy beige head. Aroma is nutty coffee, floral hops, toast, cereal grain, malt sweetness and a touch of dry straw. Flavor is big on very mild, nutty coffee, floral hops, earthy malt, a touch of spice and a light, sort of stale toffee note. Palate is light to medium bodied, with a creamy entry, moderate carbonation and creamy, but slightly chalky finish. Pretty good, not really what Id expected. Like using a nutty coffee to bridge the gap between a mild and brown ale, but you know, its a lager. The mouthfeel fits the flavor profile very well.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

Nose: malty sweetness, spice, thick slices/loaves of bread. Caramel candy apples, a touch cool. Coffee cake underneath rich with brown sugars, cinnamon, and soft sweet brown cake. No major presence of coffee except for a wee bit of percolating morning coffee here and there; flitters. Red apples and their skins.

Palate: light. Frothy up front and along the sides which drives her flavors up, over, and around my tastebuds. Dry spice in the finish; cinnamon, nutmeg. Just as her nose promised, I am in fresh homemade coffee cake and it is delish. Brown sugars melt into cinnamon melt into moist brown breakfast cakes while maple ponders whether or not she wants to be a part of it all. Not dominant, just right. Apple skins refresh and gently dry the palate while sliced wedges of candied apple offer sweet caramel and succulent apples.

Finishes sweet and dry thanks to the coffee with a light, clean bitterness that leaves a fairly lengthy aftertaste. Light, smooth, clean body and a moderate, somewhat lively carbonation.

1738,"2010-09-09",2.9,"Bottle. Pours a lovely brownish red with minimal head and kind of roasty/nutty/sweet aromas that remind me of caramel and brown sugar coated almonds.

1738,"2010-08-13",2.9,"A fair beige head covers the clearish amber-copper body. The coffee flavouring is obvious in the aroma and masks any malt or hop subtleties in there. I may be a purist, but ingredients extraction is what a lager is about to me, so that bothers me somewhat. In mouth, it feels round and relatively slick, a sensation that is surely helped by the high amount of residual sugars in there. It is sweet and I craved for more carbonation or bite to engage the palate into this toasty/vanilla sweetness. Even though I suppose quality coffee was used, it does not feel so, remaining timid on the roast and flavour length. Perhaps Im just bothered by the fact its a lager when it does not taste like one at all. Im looking forward to trying more from this under the radar brewery, but this was not my cup of tea.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1738,"2010-08-11",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
This lagers deep coffee presence is nicely integrated to toasted malts which build a smooth, well-rounded body with a delicate finish of earthy hops and roasted malts.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam covers the dark amber.
-This doesnt taste like a lager at all, which probably helps this beer to be well rated here.
-The finishing bitterness is less intense than the coffee flavor and aroma.
-This is flawlessly executed brew which pleased me a lot more than what I had expected after reading the recipe notes.

It pours amber, red, not black - and this is a huuuge selling point for me because Im sick of coffee beers that pour black: The reasoning is that coffee is a dark/malty/biscuity taste and when you pair that with a dark/roasted beer you almost always wind up with just ""burnt coffee"".

Aromas of great coffee filled the air and my head. This stuff is awesome in the aroma department just like my morning coffee.

The taste was a welcome change from all the coffee stouts I have been experiencing. The coffee flavor abounded but it was not as heavy in the mouthfeel. This brew was more like what a cup of Joe feels like in your mouth. There is enough sweetness from the malts to keep the bitterness down and keep the flavor enjoyable

1738,"2008-08-11",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 24, 2009 Ill rate this one for two reasons.  It is probably the most inventive brew Ive had this season.  Note by inventive I dont mean extreme or crazy, but I havent encountered a roasty/chocolatey/light bodied lager that is a joy to drink in 90+ degree weather with 90+% humidity after a bike ride.  Second, I think beers like this are going to be part of a backlash against the extreme beers that we trade our nuts for...give me creative and tasteful subtlety in a six pack for less than $10.  

Aroma is coffee, malt, and lager.  Taste is a refreshing combination of crisp lager, bitter/sweet coffee and chocolate, and a slight hops.  Mouthfeel is clean and extremely refreshing...by design.  Kind of like a mix between a doppelbock (sweetness), mexican lager (body and base), and a modern coffee obsessed stout (aroma and hop balance).  This beer is just good.  I have no doubt the rating average rating will decrease (its currently at 3.94), but it is easily the best of the style Ive encountered...and far more interesting than the latest barrel aged imp stout or poorly done sour.","","CMUBEERMAN"
