The appearance was a mild hazy burnt orange color with a thin white little head that quickly dissipated. Lacing just slid right on into the beer.

On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a wonderful sessionable feel. Spices dont detract on the harshness. Carbonation felt good as well.

4587,"2013-07-25",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2015 Bière jaune pâle, moyennement voilée, bonne effervescence, et surmontée dun col blanc immaculé plutôt étroit, mais tout de même très dense et mousseux, collant et persistant. Arômes de pain frais, douce pâtisserie et blé, avec sucre brut et agrumes (citron et orange), levure belge typiquement «witbier», et quelques effluves épicés (camomille, coriandre, caraçao et léger clou de girofle, poivre). Par moment, cest particulièrement parfumé, et outre les épices, on semble également déceler un houblon particulièrement floral. Par contre, lalcool semble également percer au nez par moment, ce qui est plus ou moins intéressant. Ce nez reste tout de même plutôt agréable, complexité fort intéressante, intensité moyenne-bonne. En bouche, pétillement moyen-faible sur la langue, onctuosité intéressante au palais, on retrouve lagréable velouté typique du style. Au goût, pain frais, pâtisserie, blé, sucre brut et agrumes. Les agrumes sont un peu plus présents en bouche par rapport au nez (citron, orange, pamplemousse) apportant un petit goût agréablement acidulé. Les épices me semble cependant plus subtiles quau nez, un peu de coriandre et autres herbes aromatiques en trame de fond, avec un petit houblon floral se révélant surtout en fin de bouche, menant à une amertume légère mais bien sentie. Très bon équilibre sucré/acide/amère, belle complexité, bonne intensité en bouche. Il sagit dune très bonne bière.","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","pumpkinhead2"

The aroma is divine - bringing fresh notes of the sweet orange peel, but not specifically citrus, more like sweet floral notes with a hint light herbal notes from the coriander. The flavor brings this same notes, but with the orange peels so soft and pleasant on the tongue and settling nicely on the palate.

4587,"2010-09-12",4.4,"I cannot help but LOL at anyone who reviewed this at sub-4.0.  Seriously.  What are these people thinking?

Ive had this awesome beer on multiple occasions:  First few times were on visits to Montreal, directly at DDC! brewpub, direct from the keg, which undoubtedly is the superior experience.  However in 2010 now, in the late summer season, finally some DDC beers have made their way into Ontario LCBO locations.

Needless to say, being familiar with their beers, I raced out and stocked up on Blanche du Paradis.  It does differ from the fresh draught version in the fact that the bottles actually have a much stronger, harsher astringency and the spice notes especially are WAY more pronounced here in the bottled version.

But that doesnt mean its less enjoyable.  Just different.

On to it.

Super spicy -- the coriander or whatever spices they use is no joke.  Its like a punch in the face.  Background of vanilla, wheat, banana, citrus.  A little over carbonated (just my preference) but does not diminish from the flavor, nor complexity of the beer itself.  Ive disappointedly heard users on forums compare it to other wheat beers or even hefe-weisses but I dont see the similarity at all, personally.  Its very, very spicy, and I suppose takes an experienced beer fan to truely enjoy it.

A++ in my books, have been a fan since day one trying it at DDC! brewpub and am positively thrilled with its arrival (albeit temporarily) in Ontario.","GTA, Ontario, CANADA","duckdown"

Strong pencil-yellow-toned, gold-tinged body, hazy, with a medium-sized white colored head, fair retention and good lacing.  The darker than usual yellow color of the body, looking back, was a good indicator that this wasnt going to be just a light, wimpy, simple wit; not that one would expect that from this brewery.  Aroma of a well homogenized curacao, sweet orange, vanilla and yeast.  And of course, dont forget the coriander.  Flavor begins with tangerine purée, light lemons and tart wheat.  Belgian yeast abounds as the coriander begins to assert its dryness.  But in good balance and with good timing, comes some lightly sweet malt.  Honey and almonds set things to a perfect balance.  If my ratings of McNeills talk about a fantastic mouthfeel, unique to the brewery, then I believe my notes about Dieu du Ciel beers should talk about a stupendous and predictable balance of flavors, which I think they do.  This one is no different.  The malt, spicing and yeast are all present in perfect amounts.  Very solid medium body is both quenching and fulfilling.  Smooth, creamy mouthfeel is slightly broken up by lightly pepper carbonation.  Tingling tartness of wheat and tangerines finish the beer with light bubblegum lingering.  Uncompromising tartness and a body much larger than usual, assert that this is not your grandmothers wit.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Great witbier aroma, bursting of coriander, a bit of lemon, lime zest, fresh wheat. Superbly executed witbier once again, nicely balanced and undoubtedly a style well mastered by JF Gravel, spicy (cloves, coriander) and fresh while being elegant and displaying a refreshing while creamy mouthfeel.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
4587,"2004-05-16",3.5,"Yellow cloudy body with some greenish (!!) glints. White diminishing creamy head. Very pleasant fruity nose (citrus, grapefruit, banana) that carries some hints of coriander. In the mouth, the combined effect of fruitiness and carbonation is particularly refreshing. Honest bittersweet final. Nice Witbier!","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"
4587,"2004-05-09",3.1,"Aroma is sweet, with lots of fruits, and BIG TIME BUBBLE GUM.  Slightly hazy light blondish color  with quickly dissipating white head.  Aroma also sort of smells like commercial cleanser.  Very SOUR brew with hints of bitterness in the middle.  Too sour for my tastes...","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
4587,"2004-05-08",3.6,"On tap at brewpub...straw colored pour with medium white head that dissipated fast.  Aroma of banana and clove with some citrus.  Smooth mild flavor, with very light spiciness.  I sampled this after the Rigor Mortis and the Rigor Mortis Double so that may explain the mildness that I describe here.  Very clean, very drinkable, very smooth.","Chazy, New York, USA","ChazyRPh"
4587,"2004-05-04",4.1,"Beautiful clean witbier with lemony/lime undertones.  Highly carbonated and lightly spicy. An excellent wit.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","dhurtubise"
4587,"2004-05-02",3.9,"Citrusy, spicy aroma. Pale, opaque, straw coloured with fizzy white head that recedes to ring. Nice spiciness in the initial flavour with good malt base and lasting sweet lemon flavour. Carbonation is good and body is light and refreshing. This is adult-style lemonade. On tap at the brewpub.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
4587,"2004-04-30",4.1,"wit style beer has an interesting sweet malty lemon nose with hints of soap.  The body starts tasting like a fireplace then a very big gingery taste comes along with taints of bubblegum and soap.  The finish is mildly astringent and earthy. A very fascinating beer. It was probably my favourite of the beers I tried there.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
4587,"2003-08-21",3.3,"Cloudy straw (almost white). White foam. Yeasty (banana), spicy (pepper) aroma w/ notes of orange rind & coriander. Light, effervescent feel. Yeastiness subsides somewhat in flavour & spices comes through in abundance. Some unmalted wheat as well. Finish leaves the tongue slightly numb.","Waterdown, Ontario, CANADA","joeycapps"
4587,"2003-08-17",3.6,"Cloudy yellow in colour.  Aroma was of bananas and citrus, sour.  Flavour is sweet, citrusy, slightly creamy.  Finishes slightly spicy, crisp and dry.","Peterborough, Ontario, CANADA","radiomgb"

4587,"2002-08-28",3.4,"UPDATED: AUG 9, 2003 (re-rate) Hazy yellow, not much head.  Still a fresh coriander aroma mixed with lemony notes but with an annoying hint of sulfur.  The flavor was of lemon and yeast, nice mouthfeel.  (Original 08/02)This refreshing beer is full of lemon and coriander with a nice ""wheat feel"".","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","SimonPatrice"
4587,"2002-07-05",3.9,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2008 A plethora of banana bread flavors and ginger in a rich wheaty body...Great orangey fruitiness and vivacious coriander seeds...There is abundance in paradise...This one is as excellent on tap as it is from the bottle...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

4587,"2001-06-19",3.2,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2014 Light gold, rather bright for a wit, malt-accented, clean pale and maybe a bit doughy.  Spices - mostly coriander - are understated.  Decent, maybe a bit shy.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
