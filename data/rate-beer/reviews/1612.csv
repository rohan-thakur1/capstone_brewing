1612,"2012-11-10",3.3,"Pours a slightly yellow tinted color. Notes of mold, anise, honey dew, white rice, and butter. Not bad but simple.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
1612,"2011-12-28",3.6,"Bottle served at SakeOne.  Clear body with lots of thick legs.  The aroma is floral with notes of vanilla and koji.  Crisp aromas.  The flavor is sweet rice and floral notes.  Dry.  Almost vermouth like.  The palate is dry and substantially silken and crisp, but leaves a light sweetness on the long finish.  Clean.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
1612,"2008-07-02",3.5,"Poured clear like water.  The aroma was of rice, mild-moderate sweetness.  Light fruit in the essence of pear.  The  flavor has a short fruit sweetness but becomes nice and dry.  Good warmth but no alcohol taste.  Drank cold.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
1612,"2008-04-23",2.4,"Salty mouth feel...smooth with a sour salty apple taste....sour apple, mild vinegar aroma....stream water in color (a good stream, maybe in the mountains)...my 1st rated sake yet not the 1st Ive drank...its ok...it doesnt give you the ""shot cringe face""....pretty smooth for a mid-priced sake...cost was $14.99 for a 750 ml...consumed chilled","Wayne, Pennsylvania, USA","Funknmilla"
1612,"2007-11-06",2.1,"The aroma is very neutral with mostly rice and alcohol. The appearance is clear and still. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thin. Overall its drinkable and decent but nothing special just your run of the mill sake.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
1612,"2007-11-06",2.7,"quite a strong dry sake, the sake itself is self contained with its own flavors, it works well with a nice wood finish. a very tad of tartness happens at the end.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
1612,"2007-05-26",3.5,"Chilled. Nice clear color with a touch of straw. Nose was apples. Nice dry flavor with green apples and a touch of sweetness on the finish.","Houston, Texas, USA","Zinister"
1612,"2007-04-20",3.4,"Chilled.  Flavor-wise, its nothing special; pretty one dimensional rice flavor.  It does, however, have a nice mouthfeel and is smooth as silk to drink.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","RCL"
1612,"2006-10-16",3.2,"Chilled bottle from the Party Source. Poured clear light pale color with good legs. Moderate apple and alcohol aroma. Medium body with a dry texture. Medium green aplle flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Smooth flavorful sake.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1612,"2006-05-23",3.4,"pretty smooth. poured a pale yellow almost clear hue.  Aroma was a mix of sublte granny smith apples.  Taste was mildly sweet yet dry.  Some rice and fruit notes. Alcohol was well hidden in this one.","New York, USA","crazyvin"
1612,"2006-04-30",3.2,"My first Sake... so bear with me on the ratings.  Clear body, light sweet aroma.  The taste is one of a cross between a white wine and a vodka.  Light evaporation on the tongue and a slight alcohol burn as well.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Numenor"
1612,"2005-08-09",3.4,"Ichiban Restaurant, Baton Rouge, La. - served cold. Pours a vodka-like clear with a slight off white glint to it. Aroma has some peachy notes with a touch of alcohol and some sour apple as well. Very dry tasting - has some tangerine notes. Alcohol presence is felt and is very warm in the tummy. Sake will never replace beer as my drink of choice - but a good standby for Sushi.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
1612,"2005-04-13",3.4,"Medium almond color with a light oily residue on the glass. Fairly strong aroma of banana bread, caramel apple and honey. A little nutty with a moderate apple/pear taste Extremely slight bite which lingered longer than expected. If swallowed quickly has a slight bitter taste which can be interesting. Overall not as good as expected judging by what others have said; maybe I got an old bottle?","Nampa, Idaho, USA","IdahoJizake"
1612,"2005-01-16",3.6,"750 ml bottle. Clear with a white wine color. Nice aroma of pear and apple. Smooth flavor with some fruitiness.  Good with sushi.","paramus, New Jersey, USA","mkobes"
1612,"2005-01-14",3.6,"750 ml bottle. Clear and white eine colored. Aroma that has a base of alcohol, with a little pear and apple imbedded. Flavor is smooth and dry with a little fruitiness. Decent with Sushi!","Good Beer Bar Deprived, New Jersey, USA","MaiBockAddict"
1612,"2004-04-19",3.7,"750mL bottle, 13.8% alcohol (?)
Almost completely clear with just a tinge of beige coming through. Oily, syrupy appearance on the glass. The aroma is floral and buttery with some coconut, not much alcohol at all, very complex and quaffable. The flavor has a good impact with some refreshing dryness and a covered up alcohol whif. Subtle tail, very clean and refreshing and not too lingering. I'm concerned about the alcohol percentage being lower than reported here and on sakeone's website. Time to investigate!","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1612,"2003-12-05",4.2,"I like to keep a bottle of this around (my current bottle's at my girlfriend's house); the plastic cork will keep it fresh for a long time if kept in the fridge. Quite dry, little alcohol on the nose. Some very subtle fruitiness, a little bit of the pleasant funk from the koji (which should appeal to the barnyard lambic crowd, although they'd probably get more into Shaoxing). Quite excellent.","Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, USA","Admiral"
