1016,"2017-06-17",4.7,"Poured from a bottle that was traded for the blood of two first born children. Smells of coffee and bourbon, vanilla and dark fruit. Chunky carbonation with a thin wispy head. Tastes like goddamn molasses with coffee and chocolate, with a lingering finish of plum and pure distilled sin. 15% alcohol expertly hidden beneath layers of syrup and caramel and satanic trickery.

1016,"2017-06-04",4.9,"Dark Lord 2017 (Green Wax). A Demonic Imperial Russian stout brewed with Dark Matter Coffee coffee, vanilla, and molasses.  
 Alkohol:  15% obj. 
 Kolor:  Czarny jak otchłań piekielna, jak oczy diabła - Ciemnego Pana. 
 Piana:  Taka piana jakiej bym oczekiwał w piwach tej klasy.
Gęsta, drobno ziarnista, zwarta, tworząca jedną warstwę.
Fakt, że po paru minutach opada do wąskiego łańcuszka, ale przy uzupełnieniu kielicha znowu wylewa się prawie ze szkła.
Brak krążkowania. 
 Zapach:  Aromat jest monstrualny! Aż trudno sobie wyobrazić, że to standardowa wersja Dark Lorda. Pachnie jak najlepszy RIS leżakowany w beczce po bourbonie.
To z pewnością zasługa ogromnej ilości wanilii dorzuconej do piwa.
Drugim z przodujących elementów jest kawa - nie jest to z pewnością byle jaka kawa, a najlepszej jakości ziarna. Czuć to bezapelacyjnie w aromacie.
Zapach uzupełniają gigantyczne stosy tabliczek mlecznej czekolady, karmelu i lukrecji.
Po przelaniu do szkła i lekkim ogrzaniu trunku dołączają do profilu zapachowego ciemne owoce.
Rewelacja! 
 Smak:  Wow! Po prostu bajka! Odlot doskonały! Piłem na festiwalu w Kopenhadze kilka wersji Dark Lorda. W tym 6-tego najlepszego RISa na świecie Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean.
Tamte były leżakowane w różnych beczkach. To jest wersja niebeczkowa, ale w niczym nie odstaje od tamtych trunków.
Rewelacyjna wysokie klasy kawa z dodatkiem mleka.
Dalej cukierki krówki, belgijskie pralinki czekoladowe, wiśnie w likierze, maliny oblane gęstą czekoladą, melasa, odrobina kakao, cukier trzcinowy.
W drugim rzucie potężna dawka czerwonych słodkich owoców (głównie malin i dojrzałych czereśni).
Wanilia dodaje nieprawdopodobnej słodyczy.
Piwo jest bogate, złożone, wielowarstwowe.
Potężne ciało, zbita i twarda masa oleistego trunku.
Słodkie, ulepkowate, ekstremalnie gładkie.
Na etykiecie nigdzie nie ma informacji o zawartości alkoholu. Jednak jak poprzednie Dark Lordy jest to 15% alkoholu.
Przy tej gładkości i delikatności degustacji, aż trudno w to uwierzyć.
Nieziemska pijalność, a to najnowsza warka. 
Boskie! 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Miałem pewne obawy przed degustacją tego trunku.
Wiele niepewności.
Jak sprostać takiemu gigantowi? Jak zmierzyć się samemu z dużą butlą 650 ml 15%-wego trunku?
Czy Dark Lord sprosta swojej legendzie? Czy będzie tak dobry (a może i lepszy) od wersji leżakowanych, które piłem na Copenhagen Beer Celebration?
Te i wiele pytań w głowie.

Teraz już znam na nie wszystkie odpowiedzi.
Dark Lord jest najprawdopodobniej najlepszych nieleżakowanym RIS-em jakiego piłem.
Największe zalety trunku: całkowite ukrycie alkoholu, potężna gęsta i oleista tekstura, ogromna złożoność, bogactwo smakowe i zapachowe, wielowymiarowość, słodkie, może nawet ulepkowate ciało.

Aroma is rich and chocolate forward with a balanced, moderately strong roast note. Some light anise notes with a bit of dark fruit. Light leather and ash notes with a bit of what could be described as a meaty aroma. 
Pours black with a medium sized, thick, dark mocha head that recedes to a thin film that recedes to the edges with a bit in the center. Faint lacing and moderately long legs. 
Flavor is fairly sweet with a lot of chocolate notes with a bit of caramel and toffee. Medium roast notes with some light ash and leather. Light dark fruit notes with some raisin and prunes. Hints of that meaty character. 
Mouthfeel is fairly full bodied, silky and creamy with medium low carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth.

1016,"2016-09-16",4.5,"2015 bottle with Hugh. Paired with excellent Pizza at La Coppola, Redfern who charged nothing for corkage!

Pours pitch black. Hugh reckons there is a bit of a red hue about it, but I reckon it could be caused by the wood fired pizza oven beside us. Brown head disappears pretty quickly. Looks exciting. Monster aroma with coffee, very dark chocolate, dried fruit. Almost a fortified red wine smell, which in combination with raisin reminded me of Amarone (i.e. the partially dried grapes dealy).

Mega full bodied, probably not far off being a solid. Raisin like characteristics keep trucking alongside typical imperial stout traits. Also very sweet, but this is in no way off putting, and nicely balanced by bitterness and malts coming through on a long long finish alongside very high cocoa chocolate. 

Overall, absolutely tremendous and one of the few things I have had recently that lives up to the hype.

As an aside we both reckon this was superior to the 2012 we had a couple of weeks ago, which had a bit to much in the way of a fortified/sherry like aroma. Was still excellent though.

1016,"2015-09-11",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2016 I finally took up the courage to dig out this bottle from my cellar: the famous Dark Lord. Must have been one of the first (deliberately) hyped craft beers, but being European, not having obtained it from Dark Lord Day which is apparently the only day per year on which it is sold, and not being too susceptible to hypes, I will try to rate this without prejudice. Rating concerns the blue-waxed 2014 edition. Pours ink black and visibly viscous yet burgundy on the edges, leaving deep yellow, oily stains on the walls of the glass, with a dark reddish beige, very loose head forming only with some forcing, sparkling and crackling but almost instantly dissolving, much like the head on Coca-Cola; all that is left in a matter of instants, are some small, loose, unstructured bubbles on the edges, cautiously escaping from the unfathomable darkness beneath. The very last remnants of the bottle consist of patches of muddy proteins and, likely, unfermented molasses...  As for the aroma, the smoke hung around in the neck of the bottle upon opening and by inhaling it, I already caught a glimpse of the sheer intensity of this beer. Putting my nose in the sherry glass in which I poured it, makes me fall passionately in love with this beer immediately - all the burdens of every day life are forgotten, this is utter beer heaven: a deep, rich, extremely complex and seductive tapestry of the purest quality chocolate, both dark and milk, vanilla beans, Flemish red cabbage (a wee bit iron-like) cooked with brown sugar, candied cherries, molasses and dark rhum, fine coffee but rather subtle and peeping through the chocolate from time to time, treacle, slowly stewed beef and even whiffs of cured meat every now and then, toffee and Haagse hopjes, leather, suggestions of marmelade, pipe tobacco, mocha ice cream, black peppercorns, chocolate liqueur, sweet hazelnut oil, cloves, cognac, pear syrup and a clear hint of teriyaki sauce - this is totally addictive, I cannot get enough of it. I cannot wait to take a small sip of this, and the taste is even more impressive than the aroma: a strong, enormously intense yet fine-tuned and noble candied sweetness opens this adventure in flavour, with all kinds of candied cherries, dates, peach, even oranges dancing among each other, kept in place by a very refined, tingling carbonation, almost of the same level as a coke which has been exposed to the air for a while, but providing a little bit of sourness to balance the big candied sweetness. After this friendly overture, I am plunged head first in an abyss of malts, layer upon layer of toffee, caramel, chocolate, even hints of toast, enriched with the deep, thick molasses sweetness and a strong presence of vanilla, which reveals itself retronasally in even more glory. The mouthfeel gets a bit of relief from the refined, gentle carbonation, but needless to say, is otherwise big and fat, syrupy, yet smooth and supple. The - aptly named - Dark Matter coffee remains something of a background presence: there certainly is a coffeeish flavour in the end, with a very pleasurable retronasal effect along with the vanilla, but it stays fairly modest in comparison with the gigantic chocolateness which dominates the palate; roasted bitterness stays gentle as well. Maltiness squared best describes the finish: the lingering chocolate sweetness carries everything, and even manages to bring balance to the unavoidable glow of throat-warming, rhum- and liqueur-like alcohol which goes down deep into the chest. The balance does not quite succeed, and in this particular case, for once, this is a good thing: in a beer this sweet and sugary, the peppery, drying alcohol effect in the end prevents too much cloyingness, though the thick texture does coat the mouth and tongue for a long time after swallowing. A dim, earthy hop bitterishness resides in the deepest caverns of this demonic stout, while the vanilla and elegant coffee flavours haunt the nose cavity after swallowing. A meaty umami flavour accompanies this whole parcours but it too remains subtle - it seems all the other flavours are afraid of this vast ocean of dark chocolate. Sorry to go all lyrical about this beer: I sometimes have that in really big imperial stouts. This one, to my taste, is worth the hype and worth every penny; I have been waiting to open this one and now that I did, I regret not possessing a second one for a dark and gloomy winter night, when this beer type - to my personal experience at least - truly comes into its own. Go out, wait for hours in line if necessary, but if you are into imperial stouts, you must do everything in your power to get a sip of this, this is simply divine. It has an almost unmeasurable complexity I have rarely seen, every time I sniff from it, I get different odours, one more endearing than the other, and it has an intensity of flavour rarely matched. Agreed, it has an intense chocolate and candied sweetness which sticks to the mouth cavity for a while, but the alcohol and the coffee provide enough balance for that.  I am very happy that I finally, after having read about this beer for years, had the chance to taste a bottle of this - heck, I could care less about the fact that the 15% ABV in a bomber of 65 cl will likely make me too drunk to taste other beers properly afterwards...  Still, even this iconic beer is not beyond criticism, and a more recent (2015) sample I had this year, was a little over the top in its umami-like beefiness - though still a beautiful beer - so my rating here is an average of both.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

 Intense aromas. Coffee, chocolate, booze. The booze actually smells great, despite that its practically burning my nose. Fruity aromas as well. Not as roasty as I would expect.
 Tingly alcohol throughout the taste. Incredibly sweet. Coffee flavors and chocolate malts through the middle. Slightly bitter in the finish and an alcohol burn that lasts for a few moments. Its a pretty complex flavor, but its immensely sweet.
Pretty well carbonated for a 15% stout. Pretty boozy, too, though. And the sweetness just makes it so hard to drink. Small quantities is the most I can muster with this thing.

Perfect or not, though, this is still motherlovin Dark Lord. Having the chance to drink one is an amazing experience, no matter the year. It poured pitch black and virtually headless. Aroma was very fruity with cherry, apple, and syrup. Flavor has a lot of sweetness, and yes, sad to say that apple juice flavor dominates the whole thing. However, there were some touches of cream and toasted dark fruit. Mouthfeel was exceptionally smooth.

Many thanks to Kevin for providing the bottle.

Pours a viscous, black color, with a decent, fizzy head.

Exhibits an intriguing nose between bakers chocolate, molasses, toffee, toasted malts and marmelade among a warming alcohol presence. The chocolate aromas are incredible rich on the nose, with all other flavors illustrating it, and chocolate being easily the most dominant ingedient of the beer. The aromas promise a sweeter, complex beer, leaning on toffee, caramel, dried fruits and cane sugar, against charred malts and cold, black coffee. 

The beer provides an incredible smooth mouthfeel, revealing its intriguing depth.

Tastes of milk chocolate and earthy toffee, both flavors building the luscious foundation of the beer. Cold pressed coffee acts as a counterpart to the sweeter ingedients, effectivly supported by charred malts and a note of tobacco. On top of that settles a decadent amount of molasses, coating up the other flavors of the beer. During the finish a warm alcohol burn supports the sweet chocolate, providing a rich taste of alcoholic, glazed and earthy pralines.

The beer reveals an incredible depth of flavors, which convince, based on the interplay between chocolate and cold coffee, accompanied by carbonized, earthy malts, setting the balance of the brew. The beer ends just the way it started - sweet, while its middlepart lends a huge amount of bitterness and dryness to the taste, handling its sweeter aspects in a very convincing way, while dried fruits act as a hot peak to the taste. It drinks dangerously easy, no alcohol is detectable at any stage.","GERMANY","aleigator"

The palate on this is where it begins. Its probably the most oily and slick bodied stout Ive ever tried. Very full bodied and smooth. The 15% alcohol is definitely apparently as it gives it a lot of heat akin to chili. There is a raisin/port wine-like sweetness and ends on a strong coffee/espresso note of bitterness.

Aroma -- sweet cherry, oak-like aroma unlike other Imperial Stouts Ive encountered. Rightfully so, the aroma of this beer, unlike many other world-class beers, is one of the most unique attributes of this beer. It should be admired for its magnificence. 

Appearance -- possesses the consistency of an oil well: abysmal, hellish, beyond the cusp of foreboding darkness. 

Taste -- true full-bodied, pleasantly deep, Imperial Stout that engulfs your palate and pushes you to the limit, Ross. Booziness has died down, still 15%+, nonetheless.. Subtle burnt char-like, smokiness after you have had many sips. I would not consider the beer smokey, though, by any means (i.e., I have a hard time appreciating smokiness in beer; the smokiness that is present in DL 12 is enjoyable for any IRS lover).

Palate -- encourages your palate to step its game up and appreciate the uniqueness of this remarkable concoction.

Overall -- Dark Lord is not the greatest Imperial Stout ever made; nonetheless, it surely stands in a category of its own: pure damnation, emboldening me to set my own substantial precedent. Merry Christmas, Ratebeer lovers.","The Garden of the Beer Gods, North Carolina, USA","TheGoldenChalice"

1016,"2014-08-21",4.6,"Transfer from BA review on 1-1-13- 

 Poured from a 2010 bottle into a snifter glass

 I have been saving this one for quite some time. I have had years prior as well as this vintage a year prior. This is my first review of it however. I have always enjoyed drinking this quite robust and thick brew. This is the last of my bottles and I thought it appropriate to drink on occasion of the new year. 

 Appearance  Pours a nearly pitch black color with a tiny tan head. The head fades very fast leaving almost no lacing. Upon swirling, the thickness and huge body of the beer can be seen with it clinging to the sides of the glass and it slowly receding back to the pool of beer at the bottom of the snifter.

 Smell-The aroma on this one is huge. It is heavy of a sweet chocolate and espresso smell. Mixed with this aroma are smells of stone fruits, with aromas of cherry, raisin and prune. Other aromas of vanilla, bourbon and caramel are also detected in the nose giving an overall robust and quite complex, but delicious smell.

 Taste  The taste begins heavy of cocoa and some dark fruits. The dark fruits, mainly of cherry and prune, were light in comparison to the sweet cocoa which creates a thick and robust base for the taste of the brew. Flavors of vanilla and caramel come to the tongue more toward the middle of the taste creating a chocolate covered fruit like flavor. At this point the taste is quite big and sweet. Toward the end a big boozy flavor comes to the tongue. The boozy flavor is largely bourbon in nature and when combined with the sweet and cocoa flavors of the brew, it creates a warningly sweet flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  This is one thick brew. The body is massively creamy and thick. It coats the tongue and baths it in all the intense and robust flavors of the brew. With the carbonation (not surprisingly) being on the lower side, the thickness when combined with the alcohol taste creates a very warming and thick feeling.

 Overall- A quite delicious brew. I have never been disappointed. The massive flavors that meld quite well with one another and warming feel make it a brew of high regard.","","Darkmagus82"
1016,"2014-08-18",4.3,"2014 version. Thank you to Brad for this very generous gift. Pours an oily pitch black in color with a thinner, reddish brown head. The aroma hits you with a potent bourbon and heavy chocolate. These elements are rounded out with vanilla, coffee, some light toffee, roasted malts, and slight mint. The main impression from the taste is that its extremely sweet, probably to sweet. Its big on bourbon and vanilla, with caramel and chocolate found and becoming more pronounced at the end. Aftertaste of bourbon, more chocolate, and less vanilla sticks with you for a long time. Full in body and milder in carbonation. The texture is very oily, like syrup actually. Without a doubt this is excellent. Its unique, strong, and intense. Its great for the experience of actually getting the chance to try this. However, as much as I enjoyed it, I would have been even happier if it wasnt so sweet.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"

A huge thanks to Matt for setting this up this overwhelming event!

Pours a pitch black with a dark brown foamy, sticky, lasting head. Aroma is full: roasted malts dominate, with coffee, chocolate, and a general sweetness. Flavor is unbelievable: smooth with more chocolate complexity and bitterness. The 09 batch has more coffee flavors up front. The 04 was thick and chewy and amazingly smooth. Alcohol flavors virtually non-existent in the 04,05,06 batches. 07 and 08 had a slightly thinner feel and taste than the other batches. Finish is long and complex, with a continually developing taste. The sweetness was done very well, and more subdued in the earlier vintages. Mouthfeel is mouth-coating and seeps into your palate - chewy and delicious. 09 was the most carbonated, as it was the most recent, and was bolder than earlier vintages. Always an event to have this world class beer.

1016,"2014-04-27",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 7, 2015 I have had the opportunity to try all years of Dark Lord from 2009 to present and each is slightly different. For 2014 the wax is Blue. I did not get to try this on tap but am drinking it poured from a bottle into a Three Floyd Teku glass. Aroma for 2014 is alcohol, brown sugar, and some dark fruit. Appearance is as always dark like old motor oil. When poured into the glass there was virtually no head, just a slight tan ring of bubbles around the perimeter of the glass. When swirled in the glass I was able to produce a nice 1/2 finger tan head which disappears in about 45 seconds. Taste is sweet. If you don?t like sweet you will not like this. In the flavor I definitely pick up some smoke, brown sugar, maple, some prune/raisens, and alcohol. Palate is good but was slightly thin, however as it warmed it seemed more viscous and similar to previous years. Carbonation is there but relatively laid back. Overall a very good sweet beer on par with a sweet Reislings sweetness. Not my favorite year, though this is a very fresh (drank day after DL day) bottle. We will see how this does in the years to come. I found this most enjoyable at 65°F.

Update:  I had the 2014 18 months after it was originally bottled and it improved dramatically.  It is more balanced, less sweet, and just amazing.

9 years waiting to try this beer, and finally it happens. Thank you! Now let me preface this by saying it was a tough night to shine -- DL was sandwiched between Dark Horizon 1st ed. and Prairie Bomb. Pours black with red highlights, abundant carbonation Dark Horizon. Aroma of soy sauce and dark grain. Very sweet, a bit cloying. Im thinking Southern Tier here. Toothpaste, even, early. Prufrockstar says ""marshmallow"" and hes got it nailed. Mrs. Prufrock comes back into the room a few minutes later, tries, it, and says exactly the same thing: ""marshmallow"". Its a nicely toasted marshmallow, but in the end its too sweet for the style and certainly too sweet for the Metal label. We only drank about half the bottle between the three of us before moving on. I can see how this blew minds in 2005 but its a whole different world out there today.

A: Pours dark mahogany brown. Little mocha head falls quickly leaving a simple, oily surface. Excellent clarity, actually surprisingly thin appearing with light passing through a full pour, a bit disappointing. No lacing. Surprised there was no head given the description on the bottle bragging about the head quality/quantity. Really a pathetic showing.

S: Green apples, bacon (WTF), caramel, wood, vanilla, anise, licorice. Dark molasses and sweet malts. This smells really interesting and actually keeps me intrigued as the beer warms. On second thought, just smells like sugar, apples and a hint of bacon. 

T: Sweet, cloyingly so, with burnt sugar. Caramels. Sweet malts. Smallest hint of alcohol - which makes it fairly well hidden given the ABV. Toasted rye crisps with honey. Overly sweet, like it just didnt finish fermenting - not good.

M: Much thinner than anticipated or adverted on the side of the bottle. Low to no carb. Slick and coated finishing feeling. Resonating.

O: Really a shitty beer. This is the first time Ive had DL, and theres been discussion about it being: a) not as good as previous years; b) really much better after it has a year or two on it. I can say this for the beer, it carries a high degree of baggage, and it is difficult for me to be satisfied with a beer that carries sooo much clout and then deviates from its own description of the beer. I likely wont seek particularly aggressively next year; especially given the exclusive nature of the beer, and how shitty it is fresh.

So were all standing around the table, sharing beers and salivating over smoked ribs that havent yet made it to the table, and he pulls this out and is like, ""oh hey, anybody want this? Wonder if its any good."" I picked a hell of a night to be the driver. A few small ounces will have to do. Thick, black, viscous, no head by nice legs. Pretty light on the ""old beer"" flavor. Chew; rich; sexy; chocolate; awesome. Sweet, but not at all cloying. I love how the first taste enters my mouth and is all like ""Im a sweet old rich stout, no biggie,"" and Im ready to tick it right there cause thats how I roll (not really - well, kinda), but then it just sort of hangs around in there, and the flavor seems to resonate and build into something bigger. Maybe thats just how it seems because Im savoring the few small ounces I have (so as to ensure Ill stay sober enough to be a responsible driver and parent and all). Anyway, pretty cool beer and an awesome, unexpected treat. (8/5/9/5/17)
 
2013 bottle consumed 4/24/2014.  Completely different beer and experience this time around -- I wonder if its the loss of the mystery, the age, or if the beer is different than it was, but this one is all kinds of sweet, cloying, and big on marshmallows.  Not that I have anything against marshmallows (thats sort of a lie -- I dont like marshmallows), but this is hard to finish even a small glass of.  Definitely knocking this down -- Id say to 3.7, but thats reactionary.  3.8 or 3.9 is probably closer.  Ill average that with the 2008 and leave it at 4.1.

Fades into a faint, but disagreeable, rubbing alcohol smell. Taste lacks the chocolate of the aroma but maintains the sweetness and adds cherries and other dark fruits. Some welcome funkiness from the age. Mouthfeel is a lot thinner than I anticipated. Not really a bad thing, but unexpected nonetheless. The masking of the ABV is world class. Despite the boozy aroma, you can't find the alcohol anywhere in the taste. Exceptionally done in that regard.

2011 bottle, served at 50-55 degrees in a snifter.

A- Jet black, a mocha head quickly appears during the pour but quickly dissipates to nothing. Some alcohol legs. 

S- Extremely sweet- Cherries, molasses, and alcohol. No roast or coffee detected. 

T- Very sweet, but not overly so. I can taste cherries, figs, molasses, and a bit of an alcohol bite. Finishes like a port, absolutely delicious. 

M- Silky smooth, a bit of alcohol bite but it is an easy sipper. 

O- This is an excellent beer, but I feel it could use another year or two and hopefully some of the sweetness will die down.

I noticed sweet carmel malts, roasted malts, chocolate, mild coffee, minor booze, dark fruit, more dark malts, vanilla, and much molasses. The finish reminds me of water downed syrup that?s so sweet with minor tones of coffee bitterness, and vanilla. The more sips you take the more the booze shows up in the finish and it kind of hinders the experience. Overall this was a delightful beverage.","Steubenville, Ohio, USA","Advocate_Ames"

1016,"2013-07-11",5.0,"I am reviewing the Black wax 2008 vintage cellared for 4 years.

I put this bottle away after purchasing it at Dark Lord Day 2008. It had moved with me across the world to the tiny U.S. territory of Guam. I knew there would be very slim pickings, so I brought it along. This review may be the furthest from the point of origin for Dark Lord ever written.

Two friends of mine had graciously opened thier home for a get together of workers from the University Of Guams Marine Lab, where my wife works and attends school. I decided this would be the perfect chance to share a beer they would never have a chance to try, and I didnt realize it at the time, but the day was Dark Lord Day in the states too! A miracle day!

The beer dissappointed me on its official release. There was no head, it had a bitter acrid metallic taste and smelled sort of like bitter Soy Sauce.

 Well, after 4 years of aging the difference was amazing. The room temperature beer poured black with a chocolate head 2 inches tall! The head very slowly dissolved leaving a thick viscuous lacing behind. The Stout had lost its acrid smell and taste, and picked up the rich nose of chocolate, robust coffee, raisins, dark fruits and pepper. And the taste? Now this is how Dark Lord is supposed to taste! It burst instantly on the tongue with a strong smooth flavor of chocolate and coffee, which slowly dissolved into the complex blend of raisins, fruits and cofee, finishing with a throat tickling dry scratchy pepper, coffee and a chocolate aftertaste that happily lingered on the tounge seemingly indefinately. This was a revelation to me of how good a fine beer can taste if allowed to mature properly. It was as if the original brew was a bunch of complicated parts thrown into an empty garage and untouched 4years later emerged as a Rolls Royce. Dark Lord aged is now my favorite beer of all times. A lofty thing indeed considering I have been experiencing hundreds of different fine imports and craft brews since 1982.","GUAM","starsandseas"
1016,"2013-06-27",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 17, 2015 Rating #1000! Thought I would celebrate with a top rated Imperial Stout. Been wanting to try this for a while. 2012 red wax bomber from trade with Dfonorow. Pours near pitch black with almost no head. Looks a little oily. Very sweet aroma of vanilla, molasses, raisins, soy sauce, light espresso, chocolate, and booze. Taste is very sweet as well with almost no bitterness. The flavors are great but absolutely no sweet/bitter balance. All of the aromas come through nicely, especially the vanilla, molasses and raisins. Gets boozier as it gets warmer but no indication of 15% abv at all. Tastes like it could be 8%. Medium to thick body, oily and syrupy mouthfeel. This could be top notch if there was some bitterness to balance the extreme sweetness here. Might like to try a fresh one some day to see if any hops show up as well. Overall, a really good imperial stout but nowhere near my favorites in this style.  Re-rate 5/6/15 - Enjoyed  a 5 year old 2010 bottle shared by Couch.  Thanks!  Flat black pour.  Aromas are fudge brownies, dark fruit, cherries.  Moderate to strong sweetness.  Chocolate syrup, dark fruit, light booze.  Very smooth.  Has aged very well but still not the great imperial stout this is rated as.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"

Flavor is sweet molasses up front, sweet powder sugar, a bit of dark fruit, a little bitter chocolate on the finish. Nearly no trace of the 15% abv. Sweet sweet stuff. Super velvety smooth mouthfeel and very thick. Only other stouts that have had this mouthfeel come from CCB (Hunapuh, Marshal Z). Plenty of carbonation to keep it from feeling syrupy. I was expecting more on the chocolate side, but this balances sweet molasses with dark fruits prominently. The best part to me of this decedent stout is the mouthfeel.

I had so much fun standing in line for 5 hours, who would of figured that. I got to share some of the best beers I the world with new friends that we met that day. I also got to taste 3 different vintages and types of Dark Lord. 
This stout is close to perfection. I hope to get tickets every year because it truly is an honor to be at DLD. The event is fitting for a stout this good. Completely black, wonderful nose, tastes of chocolate and balanced better than the suspension on a Ferrari. It takes a festival to honor the 'craft' of this beer.

1016,"2013-04-27",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 28, 2015 Ok, its Dark Lord Day. Im at home taking care of our twin babies while my wife is at work. 2012 vintage. Pours thick, dark, dark brown and with essentially no head (just a tiny bit of tan bubbles around the edge of my snifter). Big legs on this beer when swirled around. Vanilla and then a bit of roasted coffee in the nose. Yes this is a sweet one for sure - almost no hint of 15% alcohol anywhere. I can easily see why the barrel aged versions are so sought after. I really like this but it didnt quite live up to the hype.

Update 2015 version, just a month after it was released. I like this more fresh. I can find th vanilla and the coffee in the taste that seemed to be missing before. Bumping from a 3.9 to a 4.1.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"

2009 vintage, white wax - Pours pitch black with a tiny sticky head that disappears quickly. Intense and complex aroma of roasty malts, sweet vanilla, hints of syrup, molasses, salty licorice, tar, alcohol and caramel. Taste is quite robust and complex with strong roasty sweetness and notes of molasses, rye, sweet vanilla, plums, ripe fruits, caramel, coffee and licorice. Finish is warming, sticky and long lasting with roasty rye notes, hints of molasses, vanilla and tar. Quite complex and massive, but surprisingly well balanced imperial stout. Surprisingly drinkable and tasty considering the sweetness, which Im usually not that fond of. Here the heaviness overpowers it nicely.

It poured a dark inky black with almost no head and little carbonation which is what you expect from a high ABV stout. The mouthfeel was thick and filling. A powerful aroma, boozy, port like. Malty sweet, plum, lots alcohol burn. You get the heat but its not overpowering. Smooth, each sip is quite different! It is a really complex beer which changed as it warmed up.  Amazing, it lives up to the hype. A must try for all beer lovers. ----2014--- Dark lord 2014 

Bottle through a trade with Charule in Chicago drunk a year later on Dark Lord Day at a tasting in Osaka. Pouring pitch black with a rusty wisp of foam that vanished in the blink of an eye. The nose is phenomenal: molasses, maple, sweet burnt sugar. Full bodied, surprisingly chewy nuttiness, Nutella, rich caramel, vanilla - as with the 2009 every sip gives you something new.

Probably the thickest beer Ive ever had; grips the glass unlike any human-consumable beverage Ive ever seen; could just about eat this with a fork.  Oozes licorice, cherry, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, and more.  Shockingly sweet flavor, even after 4 and 5 years.

The 2008 bottle was significantly different from and better than the 2009.  Even at 4 years old, the 2009 was too syrupy and sweet.  The 2008, with an extra year to mellow and possibly a slightly different recipe, exhibited less sweetness and more roast.

12 - 4.2/5 3rd time trying this.  Had fresh on tap, 9 months old, and now.  Definitely improving with time.  Way to sweet new.  Sweetness has died down to the point where it is actually about as sweet as 13.  Main difference here is that there is a lot of cherry, especially on the back end.

Overall - The 2007 was more complex and the beer had changed a lot, the 2011 was more chocolatey but the taste was possibly more balanced. I preferred the 2007 - better aroma and palate but they were both great beers. Its a great Imperial Stout - only criticism its rather sweet. But there are better impys out there....Magic Rock Bearded Lady Id still rate over this -  8/4/9/4/17 4.2","Near Carrick-on-Shannon, IRELAND","stravale"

A: Pours absolute onyx with a massive khaki color head. Retention is amazing. Two things you wouldnt expect given the high ABV. This is the absolute thickest looking beer on the planet, no question.

A-- Dark, thick syrupy looking pour. Very little if any carbonation. No head at all. Just a bit of film with this. Massive and evil looking beer. Bordering on port. No head retention, no nothing. Lots of alcohol lacing on the sides of the glass. 

S-- Dark fruits, raisin, and a lot of malt. More I worked into this it smelled like a port or a Thomas Hardy Old Ale. Early on a lot of booze ut once it settled down it was closer to a Hardy in every way in the nose. 

T-- Thick, syrupy, rich and a lot of raisin, dark fruits and port like qualities in the nose. 

M-- Over bearing and rich. A lot of fruit and syrup. Can tell this was a mess as a pup but with age this changed to a huge old ale. A lot of fruit and leather. Thick as hell and sweet to boot. Booze was well hidden for how sweet it was and drew a comparison to a old school Thomas Hardy profile. Little carbonation and a lot of body to this. 

O-- 09 had to be a mess. Has developed into something good but very port like. no way I could drink the whole thing on my own. A lot of sugar and very thick. 15% ABV is well hidden in it, the thickness it is there as well as the sweetness.

Thanks to woodjjacct for sharing this one!

Appearance: Black as night with no head formation. Swirling does create a one finger head but it does dissapate quickly. Absolutly no light penetration at all even when held up to light. Your typical RIS in appearance.

Smell: Big time molasses notes with the dark fruits taking a center stage. Sweet very sweet with alcohol soaked figs. Some dark maybe blackberries evident and some tobacco notes. Leather is also noted at the tail end.

Taste: This is one enormous beer! Very, very sweet with alcohol soaked dark fruit jumping out at me. Molasses and brown sugar very evident and the sweetness lingers forever. I feel as though the beer has literally stuck to my teeth, gums, and tongue. A trip to the dentist tomorrow may be needed. The sweet sticky feel just does not leave at all. It is very chewy at the same time. No alcohol to speak of. 

Mouthfeel: This is very creamy and no carbonation and so so palate covering that its hard to believe. It covers all of my mouth and lips to the point that it is cloying.

1016,"2012-06-28",3.8,"Vintage 2010. Poured into a snifter. Pours gluggingly a deep black. Sits heavy in the glass, and from it proceeds a thick mocha frothy head. The aroma is reminiscent of a stepping into the dwellings of a chocolatier. Big sweet chocolate notes, licorice, ethanol burn on the end. 

The body is warm, viscous, and palate-coating. Has held up well after 2 years of utter darkness. Subtle carbonation play on the tongue. Starts out with a sweet kiss of milk chocolate. The sweetness melds well with the mildly bitter character, but then the soy sauce-like flavor kicks in. Alcohol is noticeable, and adds a nice touch of warmness on the back end. This is good, though, this beer seems lacking somehow. Glad I had it, and glad I aged it, but Id like a fresh one to compare it to, no doubt.","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"

1016,"2012-06-25",4.0,"Have had multiple vintages a few times and finally deciding to rate.

Pours thick oily jet black, with some mocha head that dissipates. This beers got legs!

Aroma is of rich burnt coffee, with a lot of sweet milk chocolate to complement; also hints of pine. See differences in vintages below.

Flavor is rich alcoholic burning cough syrup sweetness, then a bitter chocolate finish. 

Very light carb, thick oily mouthfeel.

Overall a fantastic beer but there are huge differences between vintages.

Here are general notes between vinatages:
2007 - Smooths down quite a bit and you get a huge dominant mocha flavor
2008 - VERY huge fruit aromas and flavors. This has currants, cherries and chocolate covered raisins
2009 - Definitely very hot, some licorice and tobbaco flavors as well
2012 - tons of molasses and burnt sugar, hints of coffee

1016,"2012-06-24",4.7,"Dark Lord vertical: I was fortunate to sample all six years of this great brew (2004-9) side by side at a tasting I hosted. Thanks to Brad for providing 04,05,06 and to Tony for providing the 09. Review is from my notes taken last night.

A: Awesome artwork on the label. Pours pitch black with a brown frothy, sticky, persistent head. Picture perfect for a big RIS.

S: Roasted malt and lots of it, chocolate, coffee, sweetness

T: So smooth, more chocolate. The 09 batch has more coffee flavors up front. The 04 was thick and chewy and amazingly smooth. Alcohol flavors virtually non-existent in the 04,05,06 batches. 07 and 08 had a slightly thinner feel and taste than the other batches. Complex, long lingering taste that continues to develop after you swallow. The sweetness was done very well, and more subdued in the earlier vintages.

M: This brew coats the mouth and seeps into your palate. Chewy and delicious. 09 was the most carbonated, as it was the youngest, and was bolder than the earlier vintages.

D: This is a huge beer and slightly sweet, which is natural, given that it is a 13% RIS. I look forward to the next time I can open a bottle of this. This will always be on my wants list.

Notes:
Paired with gourmet dark chocolate.

The 04 left a thick stain in the bottom of the glass. This brew was going strong after six years of age. Plenty of carbonation left and no off flavors. This was an incredible experience.

2010 vintage consumed November 5, 2010.

I was surprised that Dark Lord took the cake. Darkness had aroma of slight soapiness, and the palate was rather bright and lingered. I have to add that the Dark Lord was 2009 and the Darkness was 2011. The Dark Lord really had an aspect of brandy and had a similar hint to Utopia. There was absolutely no lacing or legs, funny for a 15% beer. Overall, there was a nice bitter chocolate flavor and wasnt too cloying. Amazing beer.

The taste is burned brown sugar and heavy milk chocolate syrup, port wine and blackberry jam. Big, sugary notes of oatmeal cereal and dark chocolate. Vinous and smoky, too. The texture is very oily, the bodys quite thick and oaky. This is a very viscous beer. Overall, the 2007 vintage is still drinking actively and a bit hot. I see now why people dont typically recommend drinking young bottles. This beer has such a huge profile that its hard not to feel a bit let down.

Candi sugar, dates, raisins, molasses, toasted malts, raw earth in the back of your mouth, dark baking syrup, faint grass, and roasted barley. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy.

Update

2012 edition rated. Spent 3 years in the cellar. The beer pours motor oil black with a tiny dark tan head that immediately disappears.  Aroma is stone fruits, molasses, wood, hints of bourbon, roasted barley, dark roast coffee, cocoa and milky dark chocolate. Really complex. On to taste. The complexities of the aroma have nothing on the taste. Brown sugar, molasses, cocoa, milk chocolate, espresso, maple syrup, soy sauce and some darker fruits, mostly plums , prunes, and raisins. There is a lingering flavor that reminds me of maple and brown sugar oatmeal. The beer lingers in my mouth for a few minutes and different flavors keep developing and changing. The mouthfeel is very sticky and heavy, but I cannot detect any alcohol. This beer was amazing fresh, and 3 years has only improved it.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Thechasm442"

Theres coffee malts in there as well, vanilla bean too, a wine scent as well. Caramel, toffee and booze. Tastes incredibly sweet, its like eating a chocolate cake thats been soaked in rum or whiskey. Obviously chocolate, coffee, booze, toffee and caramel. Theres an oil like texture on the palette.

300th review and Drinko de Mayo.

Pours a lighter black (if possible) with almost no head. 

Smell is sweet raisins and boozy. Dark red fruit. This smells way closer to an English Barley Wine than a RIS. Almost sickeningly sweet. 

Taste is also very sweet and boozy. It has some roastiness and faint chocolate, but mostly the deep red fruit from the smell. Lots of alcohol heat for sure. It is very complex, I will admit that much. 

Very waxy mouthfeel, full bodied. Heavy, and you can tell the abv is there, but still reasonably drinkable. A sipper. 

Not what I was expecting, and not even close to one of my favorite RIS. First FFF I have been genuinely disappointed in. I now understand why this is described as a ""sweet boozy mess"".","Seattle, Washington, USA","Smurf2055"
1016,"2012-05-04",3.3,"UPDATED: NOV 8, 2015 Sample from a 2012 bottle (thanks a ton to the person that shared). Pitch black color, some light brown head. Bit of lace (slides down slowly). Very interesting nose-smell - like some sort of seasoned sea food. Big body, very light carbonation. Dry texture, slightly sticky aftertaste. Molasses aroma is the first thing I notice (maybe thats what that fishy spice aroma was). Some coffee. Kind of a unique sweet taste. Slight, light bite (alcohol is well hidden, though). Very interesting, but overall, I cant get past the molasses. Would be very interested to try some of the special variants, though. 7 / 4 / 7 / 4 / 15Re-rate, 5/17/13: 22oz bottle, 2009 vintage, shared by b3shine. Pitch black color. Good thin brown head. Fades quickly to a very minimal ring around the edge, no lace really sticks. A loose clear thick brown sheet on the glass, though. Way less molasses and sweet notes in the fresh 012 I previously sampled, thats a good start. Huge body. Nice big chewiness. Lighter carbonation. More dry finish. Big roastiness, some light coffee. Actually a really good imperial stout now, my kind of stuff. Night and day difference between aged and fresh 8/3/8/4/15 Re-rate, 11/8/15: 2014 bottle, thanks to Chris R for sharing. Black color, with no head. Super-sweet malt here, too sweet for me. Decent dark chocolate, some mild coffee in the finish, along with the big sweet malt. Big body, kind of slick. Chewy for sure, but unnecessarily malty and unbalanced. This is big just for the sake of being big. Some fig and dark fruit. Too sugary sweet for me overall. Hard to sip, not very appealing. Yeah, this is a dumb beer. Probably represents a lot of whats wrong with beer geek culture. Would anyone care about this if it there wasnt so much hoopla behind it? A prime example of what artificial scarcity can do to perception. ~6oz was probably too much, takes effort to sip through the rest of it.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

Aroma had traces of coffee, but lots of chocolate (bitter and dark), roasted malts, and alcohol. The taste brought that sweetness right away, maybe some dark fruits with the chocolate and oak. I also got a slight trace of vanilla.
Of course, this baby was full-bodied, sludgy, thick, and a tongue-coater.

Overall- Very good Imperial Russian stout. A bit sweeter than I would like, but great nonetheless. If you are looking for that really bitter stout then this might not be the one for you.

Loads of raisin and chocolate with some roasted coffee and sweet mocha flavors filled the palate. Some prunes and red fruit were also playing in the mix. Great stuff. This is an excellent brew that that cant be passed up. BA version, here I come!","Florida, USA","OmegaX"

Aromas full of dark chocolate, coffee, raisins and molasses are impressive; coming together like raisinettes! The mouth-feel is smooth and sweet - lots of cocoa, raisins, mocha and warm alcohol.

1016,"2012-03-04",4.2,"2011 - Yellow Wax, 22 oz bomber into a DFH signature glass. It was a bit of a struggle to open this, I had to saw and peel off all the wax on the cap in order to get the opener to fit. 

A - Looks like most RISs. Pitch black motor oil body with a thick mocha head. Dies down to a nice cap and edging. Light lacing and retention, has alcoholic legs to it.

S - Ummmm. I dont know? Super roasty malts, coffee beans, sugar, plums, cherries, leather, oak, vanilla, tobacco, more sugar, soy, booze, and about 20 other things. There is so much happening here its a bit overwhelming. 

T - I will just preface this by saying that I love sweet beers. This is by far the sweetest one I have tried. It makes ST creme brulee look like a health drink. Its just a diabetic mess, and I love it! Starts off with an unbelievable sweetness that is very strong on the vanilla. This lasts for a while. It really isnt until the sugary coating leaves my tongue that I can taste some other notes. Burnt oak, cherries, caramelized dark fruit, coffee, and cocoa nibs. Not as complex as the nose, partially due to the cloying sweetness.  I drank a few glass of water to get through this beer.

M - Medium to thick body that really coast the tongue. Carbonation is surprisingly high. Could not detect the high abv in the taste at all.

O - One of the most interesting stouts I have tried. I was not prepared for how sweet tasting this is. Its like drinking a vanilla stout syrup. Despite the sweetness, its delicious in the same way that a decadent dessert is. The base beer is nuts, I cant even fathom how they can work in brandy barrels and vanilla beans for the variants. This is a must try beer, but I wont be trading for one in the future.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

1016,"2012-03-01",4.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 1/31/2001.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip. This was the finishing touch on an epic tasting. 2010 bottle.

This is just black as ink, all the way through. It pours out thick as molasses into the glass, leaving a small brown head to fend for itself for a minute before fading and leaving no lacing. Foreboding, this is a Dark Lord indeed.

There is a ton of character packed into this aroma. Roasted malt, dark chocolate, roast coffee, molasses, and lots of alcohol.

Very dark roasted malt, espresso roast coffee, molasses and soft caramel come into the flavor up front. The chocolate flavor reminds me of fudge, both in taste and consistency. The flavors intermingle and dance on my tongue, eventually leaving an aftertaste that is mostly sweet with a soft bitterness. The alcohol can barely be found, except in a stomach warming sensation. 

Dark Lord is extraordinarily thick, although I dont think that surprises anyone. It starts getting into the syrupy realm, but is not overly so, at least for my taste. This is creamy and buttery, with a medium level of tight carbonation wrapped in a huge body.

This is definitely one of the best stouts I have had. I would not crown it champion, but it is up there for me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

I opened a 2011 bottle at a tasting. It was very good, and the alcohol was mostly hidden, but it was by no means the best beer I have ever had.  It was painfully sweet.  Maybe more time will help this beer and I hope so because I still have another bottle.  I loved the coffee aroma and flavor, but I could not imagine drinking any more than the 6oz I had myself.

Nose is red wine, earthy, port fortified wine, touch of bourbon, but mainly red wine aroma. Taste is red wine, like a fine burgundy, but with more of an alcoholic kick and theres a bitter earthiness, malty chocolate and some wood fire smokiness. Yes, and the molasses. Not getting much of the coffee although maybe its in the bitterness. About three sips in, despite drinking most of the evening I felt a distinct alcoholic fug go up my neck and into my brain. Like when drinking something strong like whiskey. Its a sipper this one. Is it a beer though? Ive never really had a beer like this in my life. Would I want to drink this every week? The answer to that is not really. And therein lies the conundrum. Its sophisticated, complex and possible subblime for a couple of mouthfuls, but its not really a beer. Its more like a glass of fortified liquor to be drunk as an aperitif.

The beer has been cellared since 2010 Dark Lord day. The beer was lightly chilled and served in Imperial Pint glasses.

Ar- Very sweet! Burnt sugar notes, milk chocolate, dark cocoa, and cocoa nibs, sweetened and fortified port wine notes, molasses and of coarse the expected roasted and chared notes. Even still this beast never lets up on the sweet. 

Ap- High marks for presentation. The body of the beer is a impenetrable blackness. Yes this beer has a darkness no matter how it is back lite. The head is a burnt tan coloration and resolves too fast. Perhaps the Darklord could use some Viagra? Because the Enzyte aint working so well. 

T- This beer is very very very sweet upfront. Burnt sugars almost rescue this wreck but not enough. The burnt sugars are backed by milk chocolate, dark cocoa, alot of people claim fruit of a dark nature, I just get a fortified port wine like note, darkly roasted flavors try to head this into a drying ashey flavor zone to no avail. Think of a Gomjabar box. Instead of pain its sweet upon sweet upon sweet upon sweet. The alcohol peaks out from time to time but again more sweetness. 

P- Full bodied the way I like my RIS. Low carbonation makes this one seem fuller. Alcohol is a bit hot but not in a bad way. The oilyness in the body makes the sweetness almost diabetic coma inducing.

1016,"2011-11-29",5.0,"It turned Vader to the darkside.
The instant you pour it into your glass and take your first smell is the moment when youll finally appreciate its lure, pure happiness in a glass, an intellectual beverage to say the least. Youre nose is bombarded with waves of pungent aromas, sweet dark chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, coffee, and most eloquent of all is its rich dark fruits, cherries, dates, raisins, a port wine like undertone that would make the Trappist Monks of Belgium rise their glass in approval. 
 Taking your first sip is now inevitable as the lure of Dark Lords demonic character comes to life, although caution is advised as youre approaching the point of no return. You raise your glass to your lips only to be led deep into a dark abyss as it shows you all phases of the moon at once. The viscous mouth-feel leads to a masterful gustation of vibrant flavors, as ancient Belgium meets new age America. Intelligently well put together, Dark Lords well balanced nature gives it a sophisticated character that stands alone among other craft beers. Youre enticed by an astonishing array of dark fruits, sweet chocolate, caramel, coffee, and molasses all so perfectly blended that they seem to be orchestrating a symphony in your mouth. Sip after sip the draw brings you deeper and deeper into its sinister domain. Dark indeed youve become, as you franticly savor every taste that passes through your lips, each sip inversely superior to the previous.From the disturbing creature on its label to the different colored wax that seals each years bottle; Dark Lord has risen from the deadly hollows of the underworld to become a mythological figure in the world of craft beer. So does it defy description? Without a doubt. Is it demonic and evil? Well, cellar a bottle long enough and you may very well find out.",", New Jersey, USA","broozer81"

1016,"2011-10-29",4.2,"I shared a 2011 vintage bottle with a friend: yellow wax.  It was poured into a footed chalice.  The beer pours a slick, jet black color with a finger of roasted, coca-cola colored head that followed through all the way to the end of my glass.  My friend got the second pour and the head was absent entirely.  Overall, the beer looks impressive and strong.  The aroma was where I felt the beer was the strongest.  It was giving off pungent waves of deep coffee, syrupy raisins, malty grains and dark, complex chocolate.  The nose was an experience in itself.  On first sip, this beer slams you with flavors of molasses, dark fruit, vanilla, prunes, massive raisins again, and a sticky, dark grainy flavor.  If you poured out a bowl of raisin bran and then left it to get soggy in molasses instead of milk, that would give you an idea of the syrupy graininess of this stout.  The beer finishes cloyingly sweet with bitter coffee and dark fruit again.  Overall, the mouthfeel is very syrupy and viscous and it is also VERY sweet.  This is a beautifully crafted and amazingly complex beer with tons of intense flavors to show off, but I feel it suffers a bit under its own weight; its a bit unwieldy and too sweet to be drinkable.","Pennsylvania, USA","bosendorfer"

Le liquide a une robe très foncée, à la limite dêtre noire, bordée par des reflets profondément rouges.  La tête mousseuse est bien petite et se retire rapidement, sans doute affolée par les obscurs déploiements de la concoction.  Le nez est un spectacle grandiose, une mise en scène dune inquiétante beauté: les grains rôtis sont complexes, les malts riches, débordants de café et de fruits rouges, de cerises et de chocolat noir, touchés par des effluves de rhum et des parfums de porto, effleurés par des pointes de sauce soya et indéniablement balayés par un souffle chaud et enfumé qui revient sans cesse, comme une enivrante complainte, des profondeurs des ténèbres.  Sur les papilles, le théâtre est grandiloquent, un véritable dialogue qui illumine les plus sombres dédales de mon être: les flaveurs sont décadentes, touchées par une mélasse fruitée, noircies par le chocolat et les grains torréfiés, baignées dans un alcool riche et coloré, goûteuses en prunes et en cerises avec, en filigrane, des petites touches salées étonnantes.  En bouche, le corps de la bête est habilement musclé et intelligemment sculpté par une effervescence douce et contrôlée.  La texture du liquide est une liturgie passionnante, une caresse asservissante, une ode à la tentation de la chair.  En finale, le chant est bien long et vivant, secoué par des saveurs justement imbriquées, poignantes de notes rôties et de notes plus douces, tonitruantes de fruits et bien chaudes dune eau-de-vie ensorcelante.

1016,"2011-10-10",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2014 Bottle, vintage 2009, 13% ABV. An opaque black beer, with a small. frothy, fully diminishing brown head. the aroma is moderately to heavily malty (roasted grain, chocolate syrup, caramel, some coffee), with notes of fudge, vanilla, alcohol, hint of dark fruits. The flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Full body, creamy/syrupy texture, soft carbonation, very long finish with moderate to heavy bitterness, moderately to heavily alcoholic. First of all, the 2009 version is not supposed to be the best vintage and I hope so, because, even though its a very nice beer, it has more than one flaw to deserve its astronomical rating. It has almost no head and it has a good, but standard aroma. The balance is pretty good. The palate is certainly the best department, due to its huge body, a mainly creamy mouthfeel and the right amount of carbonation. Boozy, but not bothering alcohol feel. Overall I hope the other three bottles I have will be better, and each one is from a different year. A good beer, but like many other impys oit there. Good, but lets hope for the other vintages...

Bottle, 2008 vintage. An opaque black beer, with a small, frothy, mostly diminishing brown head. The aroma is moderately to heavily malty (roasted grain, chocolate, caramel, molasses, coffee), very lightly hoppy (resin), with notes of vanilla, berries, alcohol, with a touch of sherry. The flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Full body, creamy texture. soft carbonation, very long finish with moderate to heavy bitterness, moderately alcoholic. Considerably better than the 2009 version. Just a touch of oxydation, but it looks better (the small head never fades completely and its lightly lacing), and its best structured. It seems even fresher and less boozy. Probably my 4 rating at the 2009 version was excessive. This is a really good stout and is enjoyable in larger amounts than the 2009 vintage.

Vintage 2010. An opaque black beer, with a small. frothy. almost fully diminishing brown head. The aroma is heavily malty (roasted grain, chocolate, caramel. some coffee and molasses), with notes of alcohol, vanilla and perhaps a touch of licorice. The flavor is heavily sweet, lightly sour, lighlty to moderately bitter. Full body, creamy/oily/syrupy texture, soft carbonation, very long finish with moderate bitterness, moderately alcoholic. Incredibily thick and viscous. Impenetrable body, good, pleasant aroma, but not outstanding and similar to many other impys out there, but excellent taste, wonderful palate, with the right alcohol bite, absolutely not excessive for its size. It tieswith the 2008 vintage and its a lot better that the ""normal"" 2009 version. (8/5/9/5/18=45)



2011 vintage. An opaque black beer, with a small, frothy, fully diminishing brown head.

The flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Full body, creamy/syrupy texture, soft carbonation, very long finish moderate bitterness, moderately alcoholic. Incredibly thick, viscous and sugary sweet. 15% are well hidden. Many nice notes. More or less at the same level of 2010.  (8-4-9-5-17=43)

The flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Full body, oily/syrupy texture, soft carbonation, long finish with light to moderate bitterness, moderately to heavily alcoholic. It still scores pretty good, thanks to the pitch black body and a powerful and after all various (although not particularly complex) aroma. In the mouth its only average since the sugary sweetness becomes overbearing and fatiguing after a few sips. Its almost harsh and a bit oxidized, too. Were still talking  of a nice beer, still a shadow in comparison to its glorious past (4.5 in 2008). Ill still keep that score hoping something will change.

A - Pours opaque black with a small half finger tall dark tan head, dissipating down to almost nothing, leaving my glass tinted a dark shade of brown.

S - Smells of rich chocolate sweetness, dark roasted coffee, dark fruits like figs and raisins, light vanilla sweetness, and a very faint cherry twang. This one has aged beautifully over the last four years.

T - Plenty of chocolate sweetness up front slowly giving way to a mix of dark roasted coffee and more chocolate malt. As the sweetness begins to die down you can detect some of the vanilla, dark fruits, and a bit more of that cherry twang. Finish has tons of sweet roast lingering for quite awhile. This is one of the better vintages of DL I have had.

September 2, 2012 - did a 3 year vertical of the 10-12 at home with Brandon.  Some chocolate in the aroma for the 10, some alcohol in the 11 and the 12 had a stronger alcohol aroma.  Still very good, but I have had so much since trying this for the first time....so dropping my taste rating to a 9, appearance to a 4 and overall to 18, so went from a 4.9 to 4.5.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
1016,"2011-07-03",4.9,"UPDATED: JUL 8, 2012 This was the yellow wax 2011 bottle and sent to me by Strykzone, and I will be eternally grateful.  It pours what look to be at first glance jet black though held up to the light shows it is really very dark red, and has a small, dark brown head, that disappears relatively quickly.  The nose on this is amazingly powerful, with lots of dark ripe fruit. Very complex, but I get plum, fig, raisins, citrus, dark chocolate, and roasted caramel malts. Wow.  The body is very rich, and the mouthfeel is oily and coats the inside of the mouth. Really smooth and no sign of the alcohol.  How do they manage this?  The flavor starts with the dark chocolate and moves quickly to the ripe fruits, with plum, figs, licorice, caramel, a little chocolate, and a good taste of what heaven must be like. The finish is very long and a little bit dry with a roasted malts and citrus bitterness. Overall this beer is incredibly complex, and is about as mellow and smooth as a beer can be.  In some respects this is like drinking a fine vintage port or world-class cognac.  I shared this with my brother and wife, who both said it may have been the best beer they have ever consumed. I agree. I am still saving that 5.0 for the beer yet to come and can only downgrade this a fraction on appearance. Again I can not thank Strykzone enough for sending the incredible beer my way. I am overwhelmed.  Best beer every for me.

Addition.  Just had the red wax 2012 version. Again I am amazed at how 15% alcohol can be completely hidden. Just as good as ever.  Thanks to Strykzone (Dave) for sending  this best of breed my way.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
1016,"2011-07-03",4.2,"One of the blackest and thickest beers you will find. Pours like oil releasing heavy aromas of sweet chocolate, tar, leather, honey and grapes. Palate is heavy and sweet black malt. Its massive all the way from malty and chocolate, to spicy prunes and figs, to the inside of a catchers glove - all sweet and all powerful.

Complex olfactory notes set in immediately including cherries, licorice, vanilla, and raisins.  Taste is not overwhelming, building levels of sweetness and alcohol.  High ABV is surprisingly well-masked.  Typical coffee notes are pleasantly absent on the palate as well as a satisfyingly smooth lack of carbonation.  Deeply aromatic.

Heavy caramel, molasses, lots of bitter chocolate and coffee, nice roasty malt tones, light toffee and brown sugar under it all.  Some vanilla.  Taste is much the same, but with an odd lingering metalic note underneath the residual sweetness that really hurts the beer overall, as it is the flavor that I am left with.  Overall, a good RIS, but the metal flavor does not do it for me.","California, USA","LamarBurton"

Rich chocolate throughout, some cherry too, light roast, bittersweet coffee-esque finish.  Super rich mouthfeel.  Carbonation was perfect.  Light.

A: Rich opaque beast! Not much carbonation, just a few stray bubbles surfacing here and there. No head, although I tried to create one with my pour.

Got this at Craftheads bar in Tokyo while on a business trip there a few days ago (4800 yen = US $59...glad that I get to expense this).  Pours a near pitch black color with some translucent brown around the edges and only the thinnest whisper of a head.  Aroma has lots of booze up front, candied cherries, port wine, chocolate, vanilla, burnt malt, and tobacco.  Flavor also has some big booze right away along with notes of very thick molasses and caramel, really rich nice fudge, chocolate covered cherries, brown sugar, but only vague hints of coffee.  Creamy and soft on the palate especially considering how big and thick this beer is.  Really, where is the coffee (none in the nose and only a little in the flavor)?  Also I am surprised how boozy this actually is.  Quite good but I was somehow expecting more...especially as this is the #4 beer in the world according to RateBeer.  I would take a KBS or Speedway any day over this.  But I am still glad that I got to try this.  (1235, 567)","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"

Very sweet and rich aroma, it smells like dark fruit, chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, vanilla and some molasses.  Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, its very sweet.  It tastes like roasted malt, dark fruit (cherries), milk and dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee, molasses and a bit of charred/burnt malt.  Mouthfeel/body is full, its viscous and coating with low carbonation.  Its very smooth and extremely easy to drink.  The alcohol is pretty well hidden, it certainly doesnt seem like its 15% ABV.  I think this is a very good brew, Im glad I was able to try it.  If you like sweet stouts/RISs, then this one is a good choice.  Definitely recommended!","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

1016,"2011-05-24",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2011 651mL 2010 ed green wax thanks to TheTomG. The pour is a clear cola color- looking sort of deep cola brown with a medium, dense, creamy brown head that requires some major league coaxing to get out. Poured this from about 15 inches above the glass to generate a head. Holding up to the light this is pretty much opaque black though from the pour the SRM doesnt looking quite as inky as BCS or Midnight Sun Berserker or Obliteration VII. No lace remains however making it look similar to BCS. Nose is very nice: lots of old cellar notes that remind me of a really nice barleywine- toffee, raisins, port, wet wood, hazelnut, nutella, muted but very deep and rich hazelnut liquor and rum soaked cherries. Taste up front is heavy on the olives and then settles down to some serious spice with oak and raisins and mint chocolate. Sort of comes across as a cross between an oily stout and a dark barleywine like Bells Batch 6,000. Mouthfeel is oily and soft but the finish is ashy and dryer than I expected. A little bit of sawdust is not helping in the finale. 5/24/2011 8/4/7/4/15=3.8 651mL 2009 ed white wax thanks to bigmmartin. The pour is a deep, clear cola with no head and no lace. No up front is lots of volatile DMS like tomato soup, beef chili, and black pepper. Taste is ashy and dirty with tangy lemon. No good. I actually resealed the bottle with a wine stopper and drank the remaining 2/3 of the bottle the next day. It had substantially improved with no more off-character in the nose. Still poured with soft carbonation but no head and no lace still. Nose is more like the 2010 that opened up: tawny port with spicy ganache. Taste is oily, bitter, and thick like a pretty decent bottle of Bells Expedition. 3.8 level is about right for the decanted 2009 version. 5/31/2011","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

The aroma is monstrously large, though, full of chocolate and coffee and roasted malt and vanilla.  Huge nose.  Massive.  As big a smell as beer can muster.  The taste is, well, Dark Lord.  Nothing really matches it, like a chocolate-covered cherry cordial with a Raisinette inside the cherry consumed while drinking an unsweetened vanilla coffee spiked with black rum.  Feels amazing, heavier and thicker than all beers before it, as warm as it should be without any spiky residual heat.  Life-changing?  Well, kind of, yeah.  (5/29/09)","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

1016,"2011-05-22",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2014 Bottles shared with Pat, Andrew, Dallas and Bobby. Tasted 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, and then finished with the barrel aged. 2011: It pours a deep black body with some lacing. Aroma is like a perfected version of KBS - with dark chocolate, magnificent dark coffee roast, and lots of sweet molasses notes. Mouthfeel is nice, with notes of sweet maple and molasses dominating, tobacco, coffee roast, marshmallows. Although a bit too sweet. Id give the 2011 year a 4.5. On to the 2010: the sweet notes in the aroma are much more subdued, with much more roasty coffee flavors coming out. The flavor is leaning towards the chocolate side now , with the sweet notes definitely still present ( a still a bit too much) but now with some great cherry flavors bleeding through. Also, still a strong maple presence. The 2010 sits at around a 4.6 for me. The 2009 boasts a much stronger transition towards the chocolate notes with the sweetness definitely mellowing out with age. Now the beer really comes to focus - see this at a 4.7.  The 2008 bottle was by far the best, proving either the DL improves drastically with age, or there were some serious recipe alterations after year 08.

Aroma: The nose is full of dark malts, with chocolate, caramel, and light boozy notes

Appearance: It pours an almost black color with a small tan to light brown head

Flavor: The taste is malty and roasty, medium sweet, and with lots of chocolatey goodness

Palate: This one had a fairly full body and a super creamy/smooth feel on the mouth

It was quite exciting to try a 2006 Dark Lord, so big thanks to Paul for this one!  Your Impy Stout collection was exquisite!  Ill drink a Dark Lord anytime I can, what a great beer.  I didnt go quite as high on the 6+ year old one as I did on the one year old 2010 bottle, but I still liked it quite a bit.

Aroma: A huge bouquet of sweet and roasted malts, coffee, vanilla, molasses, a touch of booze

Appearance: Pours a pretty much pitch black with a very small light brown head and minimal lace

Flavor: This beer has a ton of malty flavor, medium (plus) sweetness, similar notes the nose

Palate: Im not sure that Ive even had a 15% beer with this little alcohol burn, I mean wow!  This stuff is full bodied and really really smooth.  It has a long and lasting sweetness and a great mouthfeel.

Overall Impression: 
Thanks, Nick!  Ive been holding on to this one for a while, but Im celebrating, so I decided today was the day I should finally drink this one!  I can see why this one gets so much acclaim, it is rather good.  It has a really complex flavor.  An incredibly well hidden booze for a 15% beer.  Seriously, a wow beer.

1016,"2011-04-09",4.7,"2010 green wax. Let me first start by saying that I first had a DL about a month after the release. That first bottle was low carbonated, syrupy and was overall not a good experience. This review reflects when I opened one on Christmas day. It was black with a small but decent head. The aroma is very bready, roasted, bakers chocolate, dark fruits, tar, and just very rich. The taste has a very nice breadiness, tar, and a very oily chocolate like liquid. Its nice oilness causes me to lick my lips. Like liquid oil which made for a nice mouthfeel. May very well be the biggest baddest Imp Stout out there. There is a gritty bitter bakers chocolate that in my opinion balances the sweetness but does not get rid of the diabetes that this beer may cause.","San Antonio, Texas, USA","Hopper"
1016,"2011-04-08",3.2,"2010 bomber (green wax) courtesy of woosterbill.  Thanks Bill.  Pours a dark black with a reddish tint at the edges when held up to the light.  A small light chocolate head leaves a ring at the edge of the glass after it dissipates quite quickly.  Not very mach lacing at all left on the glass.  The aroma has a very strong roastiness to it.  Also huge molasses and some licorice as well and a little bit of coffee.  There is also a quite strange metallic copperlike  aroma that comes through pretty strong as well.  Light alcohol noticeable on the nose as well.  The initial taste is really sweet with the copper note coming through as well as the molasses and licorice.  This transitions into some coffee.  The finish is strong roastiness as well as a bit of booze with a pretty decent bitterness.  Full bodied.  Low carbonation.  Syrupy.  I dont really see this beer is that highly regarded.  I found it to be way too sweet and syrupy.  The strange copper note was not enjoyable either.

I drank this from the bottle into my Orval glass.

The beer pours a jet oil black, hardly any brown with a only a little light tan head. Disappointing a little.

The aroma and taste are super awesome and sweet. The malts show off tons of vanilla, but its so fine its not overly sweet it just shows off so perfectly. Light roasty coffee on the finish with a slight alcohol burn. Hides the 15% extremly well. Super easy to drink.

1016,"2011-03-03",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 12, 2013 Shared a white wax 2009 vintage with a few friends to celebrate my buddy Steveâs first born son, Telfer. I was anticipating this beer for quite some time, so Iâm glad I finally got to crack it open with good friends. Pours pitch black with absolutely no head, but thatâs to be expected with such a high ABV. Rich brown lacing around the snifter though. Aroma is complex; subtle hints of port, dark fruits, burnt oak, roasted chocolate malts, coffee, etc. Flavor is even more complex; heavy alcohol backbone is beautifully covered by flavors of chocolate, raisin, vanilla, coffee notes, burnt molasses, oak, etc. Mouthfeel isnât as thick as I was expecting, but still heavy enough for an imperial stout. Very impressive RIS, to say the least. Luckily, Iâve got two more waiting in the beer fridge for another special occasion. Canât wait to try this again!!! Re-Rate 10/08/11: Had the 2010 vintage with some friends. Poured black as night with a thin, dark brown head that dissipates into a small ring. Aroma is foreboding. Molasses, vanilla, dark fruits, and coffee. Flavor is a little sweeter this time. Mouthfeel is right on the money though; velvety and rich. Overall, just as good as the first time around. I sampled BCS Rare and Old Rasputin XII alongside this. Would I say this was the best? No. Was it delicious as hell nonetheless? Yes.","Vancouver, WA, Washington, USA","Brewchacho4"
1016,"2011-03-03",4.8,"2010 vintage poured into Snifter.

guess what? It was black, ya know what? there was some garnet/ruby/dark red hues on the edges.
there was a decent head, not quite as dark and thick as i was expecting, but it existed and it clung.

the smells on this are heavy port like smell with fig and raisin being the forefront. definately some roasted notes with heavy malt/chocolate smells.

Tastes very port-like, the OG on this is probably high enough to make a 6% ABV beer out of. my lord, lol. i get a lot of that dark fruit flavor in the taste amongst the roast and coffee with syrupy chocolate laced with vanilla. This stuff packs a punch of flavor and complexity. amazing.

mouthfeel is thick and creamy, slightly syrupy but not disgustingly syrupy. there is enough carbonation to lighten it up. lots of sweetness battling through the heavy roast.

drinkability. this is tough to get through, 15% ABV and the alcohol is definately noticeable. enough residual sugar/unfermentables to give you diabetes. 7 oz is enough for sure.

Tastes of chocolate and dried fruit, a bit vinous, leaves a roast bitterness in the finish. Thick body, although I thought it would be thicker. Syrupy mouthfeel, light carbonation. Well I finally got to try it. Good solid stout, there are better out there, but this one ranks pretty high in my book. I would have loved the roast to be a bit more in the foreground and the fruits a bit more in the back.

I had to go back and this comment to my review after we poured the second half of this bottle. The bottom half of the the bottle was thick and chunky when poured.

Smell is of sweet chocolate syrup, roasted coffee, and some booze. Thats about it, chocolate and coffee overpower the nose.

Taste is very sweet. At first I get Hersheys chocolate syrup, Kahlua, and burnt malts. Reminds me of Sothern Tier Choklat mixed with GI Bourbon County minus the apparent bourbon, also tasted some characteristics of port as well. Hops are very light and alcohol, for being 15%, isnt too strong.

Mouthfeel is very rich and thick. Carbonation is good which lightens the syrupy consistency. Unfortunately head died rather fast and didnt add much to the beer.

Drinkability was good. For such a strong beer I was able to finish the bomber but I dont recommend it if youre planning on doing else for the rest of the day. The only downside to this beer was that after about half the bottle the overly sweetness started to get to me and I wished it was balanced a bit more.

A: 4.0 - One finger tan head with less than average retention and little lacing.

S: 3.5 - Something weird that I cant put my finger on, almost like a candied plum though theres a vegetal component as well. Roasted barley.

M: 4.5 - Thick and viscous, which is the way I like it. Good moderate carbonation. Smooth

Dark Lord 2009

A: 3.5 - One quarter inch tan head. Doesnt seem very carbonated as it pours very syruppy. Poor retention and no lacing.

S: 4.0 - Main smell is soy sauce, which I came to like as I smelled it more. Sourish dark fruitiness. Roasted barley, but much more sweet than roasty. Slight coffeeness.

T: 3.5 - Sweetness dominates roastiness. Tangy (the only work I could think of) fruitiness, roasted barley, and coffee with lots of cream.

M: 4.0 - Thick and viscous heavy body. Low carbonation. Smooth.

D: 3.5 - Okay but pretty weird. High sweetness, which is fine, but could use some more roastiness to balance.

The nose is sweet with dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, dried fig, and there is a bitter element which may be from the malt, or may be from the coffee.  There is also a bit of oxidative nuttiness at this point.  The flavor is sweet molasses, vanilla, and burnt brown sugar with the coffee bitterness coming through much more than the nose would have suggested.  There is also strong hit of dried figs and raisins on the back of the palate.

Finest coffee and chocolate are only the most prominent. Thick and sticky oily body only adds to its quality, while at the same time it remains dangerously drinkable.

Unique, over the top imperial stout and quite excellent.  Still a 4.3 for me.   10 bottle once again on 9/23/12.  Black pour with a dark tan head.

1016,"2010-11-23",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2012 On tap at DLD 2009.

A: Very, very dark with a small dark head.

S: Lots going on here, with pretty much everything dark in this one--chocolate, coffee, molasses, dark fruits. Some very mild touches of vanilla.

T: Very, very complex. The fresh version isnt quite as complex and delicious as aged. I also had a sample of the 08 Dark Lord, and that one definitely would get a 5.0 on the taste scale. This one is still beyond excellent, however. All of the tastes are similar to the smell, and simply envelop the palate with goodness.

M: Very, very smooth. Almost no carbonation, and barely a hint that this thing is 13% abv.

D: Incredible. Definitely got my freebies with the golden tickets. Hats off to Three Floyds for an absolutely incredible beer. It was my first DLD, and I plan on going back every year from here on out.

EDIT: Not changing the original scores but a few notes. Opened up my first 2010 Dark Lord on 11.20.2010. The initial smell was a bit smokey to me and not nearly as sweet as the 2009. Strangely enough, we also opened a Batch 9000, which resembled the 2009 DL more so than this beer did. The 2010 DL also had some faint chocolate, but not really any of the sweet sherry-type notes of the 2009.

1016,"2010-11-15",4.4,"Rating no. 700! :-D A stroke of sheer luck enabled me to get a taste of this legendary beer from some very generous beer connoisseurs sitting next to me and a friend @ Ølbaren, Copenhagen. I cant for my bare life imagine the pains I wouldve otherwise gone through to get hold of this baby, so what can I say...even a dog has its day... ;-) Body is pitch black with virtually no head to speak of. Nose is very ""new school"" of American imp stouts; heavy salty soy, sweet cocoa and chocolate aroma with only hints of coffee. Taste is even more intense: sweet mocha, cocoa, soy, dark chocolate, wood and hints of port wine. Extremely complex. Palate is, considering the insane ABV and complexity, frighteningly light and drinkable - worthy of an evil Dark Lord trying to pull his minions into mindless addiction... Despite all this, I still kinda felt Ive had a similar imp stout before - its really, really good but considering the near-insane hype my expectations are somewhat...hyped, too.

Big aroma is of sweet chocolate, coffee, caramel, leather and some wood. The flavor is tons of sweet chocolate, malt, caramel and vanilla, there is some bitterness hiding in there too as well as a touch of acidic coffee. The body is about as full as a beer could be. The carbonation changed through the vintages, the older bottles had less and the newer ones had more, which helped tone down the sweetness. I think the freshness of the hops and the extra carbonation made the 10 the best.

1016,"2010-10-25",4.2,"Split a 2010 vintage with a friend, about 6 months old. Appearance: Dark as night, with just a hint of ruby red at the edges. Small, brown, frothy head (regenerates with a vigourous swirl of the glass). Aroma: similar to red wine with sour grape notes; some dark chocolate as well; some rich syrup-like scents (honey, molasses).Taste: Two flavors in one: red wine taste up front; bittersweet dark chocolate on the finish. Very rich. As it warms more fruity flavors open up: cherry, plum, molasses. Alcohol presence noticeable and somewhat distracts from the palette.Mouthfeel: Typical stout consistency, but not as thick as I was expecting. Chocolate bitterness lingers + sour grapeness. I want a glass of milk afterwards!Drinkability: For a 15% ABV beer it drinks like something about half the potency. Definitely an alcoholic presence but its a gentle warmth - not a burn. Overall: A really good RIS and a really good beer. Not quite second-best-beer-on-the-planet good, but good nevertheless (great, actually).

Had the most sludge/sediment, and body. Still holding up like the 2006 but is starting to fall apart unlike the 2006 still more in its prime before it starts falling off. 

2005
Was the least balanced and most disappointing one in this vertical. It was a surprise how boozy this one was with licorice flavors. I feel sorry for anyone that got this off ebay. Your in for a disappointment.

2006
Was the best one of the vertical because it had the most balance. Flavors were all over the place. I would not sit on Dark Lord for over 4 years because after that they start losing the flavor profile. 

2007
This is pretty much Dark Lord brewed with chocolate. Lots of chocolate flavors, well balanced with some hint of coffee. Sugar crystals clinging to glass. 

2008
This one can still change a lot. It was probably the 3rd or 2nd favorite overall. Closest to the Russian Imperial Stout. Lots of roasty and robust flavors. Full bodied with some sludge/sediment. 

2009
This is a sweet stout that is tasting lovely. At its peak for sure with all the dark fruit notes with a ton of black cherry. Impressed on how this is tasting 1 yr and 6 mos into it. 

2010
After 6 months it has changed. Less heat, boozy, and its starting to develop. I can see this one changing a lot. I think in 3 years or so it should be at peak maybe less. The 09 got there faster than expected. This one should hold longer than 04 and 05. 

THE BEST ONE WAS THE DARK LORD BLEND. A SNIFTER FILLED WITH ALL 7 YEARS! TAKES A 5 OUT OF 5! ALSO ALL THE PERSONAL BLENDS LIKE 06 AND 08 ETC.

Green Wax 2010 bottle. Pours as black as a beer can be with a beige cap that hangs around for a while. The aroma is licorice, caraway seed, anise, pretty much every kind of licorice note you can think of is the smell, with lighter under tones of dark roast premium coffee, dark chocolate, and alcohol. The flavor is eyes roll into the back of your head delicious, straight up, licorice all over the place, ok, i got this one, its like you took a pile of chocolate covered coffee beans, coated them with licorice, and then blended it into a liquid and drank it, awesome! There is however this distracting apple sauce taste that kind of floats around in the shadows, it distracting, and not welcome, but everything else about the flavor is so great I am able to ignore it. Kind of hoping that it will go away as the beer ages though. The finish is top touch, the best, a bit of alcohol warmth accompanies the licorice coffee flavors into forever, or atleast until the next sip, the mouth feel is bang on creamy, smooth, chewy awesomeness.

1016,"2010-09-16",4.5,"Darklord Vertical. Beers were provided by three different guys, all tasted side by side. 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009. Rating all these vintages side by side is going to be tough.

The appearances did not vary all that much, of course the bottles are beautiful bombers all with ornate and varied colored wax indicating vintage. Beers are all black with minimal head and apparent low carbonation, no real retention to speak of and there isnt any lacing. Big variants here were the 2004 had MUCH MUCH more sediment in the bottom of the glass than the others and the 2008 was considerably and noticeably browner on the spectrum than the rest. All the beers were hazy (could tell this after someone spilled their 08 on the counter). The beer is noticeably thick (especially the 2004) leaving a syrup-like resin on the sides of the glass. The 2009 appeared to be the thinnest. I did not take gravity readings, just what I see and think.

Aroma, 2004: almost sour, a slight biting lactic smell followed by a slight ash. Some bitterness is detectable and a tiny bit of sweetness possibly from the alcohol.
2005: Much more coffee and roast in this aroma along with some nice chocolate and bitter. Alcohol is more noticable in this one.
2006: Hottest of them all so far, a sting of ethanol in the nose, sweetness is lower here, mostly ethanol.
2007: Back to chocolate, good malt syrupy aroma in this one, a good balance of coffee in the aroma, back to more the way the 2005 smelled.
2008: Weakest aroma of them all (followed by the 2004). Mild sweetness and a slight bit of ethanol in there.
2009: Strong aroma, lots of alcohol, chocolate, coffee and vanilla (didnt pick up anything like vanilla in the others).

Tastes, the 2004 was sweet and thick, completely full bodied beer. Finished slightly dry, had an alcohol flavor in the front of the mouth, but the sweetness won out. I was expecting more roast here.
2005: This was the lightest of the bunch, and the roastiest, if that makes any sense at all. Again, really high body (do you like to chew your stouts). This beer amazes me with the body on it. Less dry than 04 but there is so much more coffee in here, its nearly a completely different beer.
2006: This was the driest of them all. Super sweet up front with a nice trailing edge of slight roast. There is a biting alcoholic taste to this that abbreviates my pleasure.
2007: Still a little dry, very sweet, as sweet at the 2006, this beer is so thick in my mouth it has a syrup like quality to it.
2008: Much more roast than 2006 and 2007 and pulled back on the sweetness. Still super thick but better balanced than the others.
2009: This was probably the thinnest of all the beers in the mouthfeel department. It was nearly medium bodied and had a warmth to it that wasnt as present in the others.

Summarizing and second tasting notes. 2008 was noticeably lighter and hazier than the rest of the beers. 2004 had the most sediment and completely coated the bottom of the glass with it. The 2004 had a soy / bitter and dry taste to it. The 2005 was smooth and like chocolate. The 2006 was more sour than the others. 2007 Sweet and roasty. 2008 - more roast, more heat. 2009 was probably my favorite (with 2007 and 2005). I guess I like odd years. The 2009 did not have time to mute the flavors and let them run together into a single coherent ""thought."" They were still fragmented but I was able to enjoy the roast, the heat, the sweet, the chocolate bitter all individually making it a really interesting beer.","Maryland, USA","drabmuh"

A full body, left my mouth kinda sticky. This is the best stout ive had(and i am not claiming ive had them all).

1016,"2010-09-07",4.9,"On tap at the Mikkeler Beer Bar, Copenhagen - So dark you should make curtains out of it. This is actually incredible. A progression of amazing flavours with an alcoholic hit pretty early on. Chocolate covered coffee beans are dominant. I get the flavour of the cigar in your mouth, not the smoke but the tobacco touching your wet lips. Plenty of creamy vanilla too. The aftertatse is like a big lump of dark chocolate that you ate a while ago. A beer epiphany. It feels wonderful too. What is wrong with it? Provided the price doesnt count, NOTHING.

Im not going to bore you with all the details like how it leaves an oily sheen on the glass, or the beautiful brown colored head.  You know the legend of this amazing brew.  I will say this, the 08 in my opinion was much more chewy and I thought the flavors of bitter dark chocolate, burnt molasses, roasted malt, vanilla, and expresso were more pronounced.  The 07 was fantastic, but I felt like it was starting to unravel  a bit.  The 09 was not as good as the 08, but still better than I expected considering all the talk.  Dstructo pulled out the vertical at Hunahpus.  Tried the 04 and 05.  Tons of sediment.  The bodies were thinner with much more soy sauce flavors than the older versions.

1016,"2010-06-30",2.2,"2007 vintage with silver wax. Appearance - Oily and black with no head whatsoever. The occasional rising bubble settles on the surface for a moment, giving the appearance of a bubbling tar pit. Although theres no lace, the beer does coat the glass in an oily residue. Smell - Sweet and rich. Molasses, coffee and milk chocolate come to mind, with undertones of vanilla and raisins. Taste - Mellower than I was expecting and actually downright pleasant. Flavors of licorice, molasses, vanilla and coffee blend together harmoniously, presenting enough complexity to make this an enjoyable beer to sip for several hours. The finish is long and coating, leaving a roasted bitterness on the palate. No noticeable alcohol despite the rather high ABV; the sweet, rich flavors seem to overpower its presence. Mouthfeel - Thick; absurdly thick. Dark Lord gave me a new standard for the term full-bodied. This beer literally has the consistency of whole milk. Carbonation is nearly non-existent and never really felt, which only contributes further to the chewy mouthfeel. Drinkability - The massive mouthfeel, while probably the beers greatest attribute, also makes it difficult to drink both frequently and in large quantities - Id have a hard time finishing a bottle by myself. Notes - This beer has lost its appeal to me since initially trying it, and my ratings have been adjusted to reflect that. Not a bad beer, just not my thing anymore.","California, USA","largadeer"

But as one that has sampled several top ISs, this beer lives up to its hype and high regard.  Starts sweet with the dark fruit.  Then creamy with a pinch of carbonation in the middle.  The coffee is very subdued but gives it that spice right after the creaminess subsides.  Then the gentle bitters carry you to the finish.  The finish is excellent.  The velvety chocolate lingers on the tongue while residue from the dark fruit is still present.  Notes of vanilla on the finish as well.  The creaminess of this brew is what really makes it so special.  Many ISs are this complex but others tend to be more syrupy than creamy.  Damn fine beer.

2009.  Compared to the 2010 this beer is much sweeter.  It is not overbearing, but noticeable right away.  The year of aging must have produced the great balance that this beer pronounces.  Very smooth with little carbonation.  The molasses accents the plum and cherry very well.  Strong taste of chocolate and Intelligentsia coffee in the background. You could probably heat this beer up like coffee and it would be delicious.

2010.  Much more of an aggressive brew.  The ingredients jump off your palate and the ""big cherry"" seems to jump out creating a euphoric-like experience.  Even though this batch has lower drinkability, I feel it is a much better batch than the 2009.  I will age a few, but for the people saying you must age the 2010, I think it is all a matter of taste.  Perfect beer to pair with desserts.  Best beer Ive gotten my hands on.

S-brings a huge nose, molasses and dark chocolate up front but light, tons of sugary fruity sweetness in the back.  this smells so sweet.

But since it is so strong it wont be cool the entire time you drink it - which is where it turns south fast. The hotness from the alcohol is so pronounced it is almost like drinking bourbon neat. This masks every flavor that you were experiencing previously. The mouth-feel is more watered down than most RISs. Sad.

If it were not for the disappointing last half of my glass, actually more, this would score way higher. I think the lack of availability is pushing the ratings on this higher than they should be. It is an average RIS when considering the whole body of this. Considering the first half, when cold - much cooler than you should be expected to drink this, then it is way above average. Too bad it doesnt stay consistent, in good taste, throughout the entire bottle.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"

1016,"2010-05-04",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 5, 2011 Tasted 05, 09, and 10 versions, review is sort of a composite. 

Pours absolutely midnight-black with a nice sized deep-tanned head. Head held up pretty well in a pint glass, not quite as well in snifter interestingly.

Aromas are all over the place, raisins, molasses, coffee, chocolate, plum, bread, you name it. Vinous is definitely a word that applies.

Taste is similarly insane and layered. The 05 had wonderful complexity with chocolate of varying bitterness, smoke, wood, earth, and coffee shining through. The 09 was much fruitier, with raisin, prune, and even I swear some cherry flavors showing through. Incredibly layered and deep, every sip and savor revealing something new.

The palate is absurd, motor oil is an apt description, but while often i recoil from sticky, viscous palates it worked perfectly in this case, coating my mouth in smooth velvety goodness. Alcohol on the 05 and 09 were both in perfect balance already, and overall a nearly perfect palate for me, fitting wonderfully with the deep complexity of the brew. 

Hype aside, this is probably my favorite beer in the world right now, and i really really wish i could get a hold of more of the old vintages.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","BluePhish"

1016,"2010-04-26",4.4,"08 vintage bottle I got in a trade awhile back. Thanks for the opportunity to try this beer- my celebration of 6 months straight of a 7 day a week schedule. So this is the first chance Ive had time to sit down and write a review in awhile.

A- From a moderately lit room on a December night the body appears to be pitch almost black- the color of a well made black coffee only much thicker-the appearance does not change when My snifter is held up to the light. Just when you think the Dark Lord will be headless a dark chocolate foamy 1/2 finger thick head arises and fades more slowly but just as ominously and slowly as it arises leaving a thin collar and traces of lacing remain throughout the glass as it is sipped.

S-The nose struck me just as I unsealed the cap. Initially I smelled classic RIS with this one being particularly heavy on anise. From the snifter anise is definitely present but balanced with semi-sweet dark chocolate. Plum and molasses come through as well. The background is a sleeping ominous beast of alcohol that subtly looms.

T- The initial flavor is quite sweet with a complex flavor that I cant quite get my palate around. Certainly RIS in nature with a character where not one flavor stand out the most between vanilla, cocoa, molasses, and plums. As it lingers on the palate more prominent characters of anise, roasted malt, and dark cocoa arise. The finish is consistent with the initial flavor as a hint od dark fruit sneaks its way in as well making. Just then it turns to a dark wine and a quick, mild, lash of alcohol bitterness as it is swallowed. What lingers is hints of the whole flavor put together with an emphasis on the roasted malt.

P-Mild to moderate carbonation with a thick, viscous, and heavy yet smooth body. The alcohol is undetectable in the mouthfeel.

O- For a 13% monster this beer is pretty drinkable...it has had 1.5+ yrs behind it which probably tames it, but its one of the most drinkable beers Ive had with this high ABV. This is a rare treat that I doubt I will have the opportunity to have again anytime soon and I really am enjoying it. Best stout ever? No. Worth the hype? debatable. Great, high quality product? Yes.

1016,"2010-04-24",4.8,"UPDATED: JUL 11, 2011 Dark Lord is slowly becoming an instituion based on hype - a beer thats so good it can only be available for one day a year to calm the populous.  Unfortunately, the hype outweights the product.  Dont get me wrong, Dark Lord is one of the best beers in the world, and it truly deserves a great amount of respect.  However, the hype surrounding this beer has outweighed the taste it possesses.  Its aroma is of a thick vanilla / coffee / chocolate hybrid, its black and has the consistency of motor oil, and it has about 13 different flavors going at any point in time.  Its very good, biut I dont think that the hype its receiving can outweigh the taste it has.  But then again, no beer can probably meet that level of expectation.  Dark Lord is very good, but its history will bill itself as one of the greatest...an accomplishment that cant be triumphed, and one that might never be truly met in a popular sentiment..................................OK, its 2011 and I just came back from Dark Lord Day.  A good friend bought a bottle and decided to chill it on ice, and we enjoyed with a group of people.  There are other beers I rated today, and hands down Dark Lord was the best of the bunch.  Just a fantastic mix of coffee, lactose, brewers licorice, and a whole bunch of other stuff added to the mix that gives it an immensely complex profile.  It really is one of the best beers in the world and since I have a bottle that Ill consume at a later date, may be bumping up my rating later...................Its my 30th b-day today and Ive decided to bump up my DL rating by 0.3  With the aging, the chocolate notes come out even more mixed with the coffee to give it a flavor that can only be attributed to Dark Lord...its outstanding and damn near perfect.  Re-rating the taste as 10 because really, there is nothing out there that tastes like Dark Lord.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"
1016,"2010-04-24",4.5,"Vintage 2010:  From the bottle.  Pour produced a thick, dark body, with a small cascade of caramel-colored foam, like an espresso.  As heavy as this beer is, it is a marvel that any carbonation got through.  As expected, there is a strong aroma of coffee, and malt, with a whiff of alcohol thrown in.  Also detected in the mix was a slight aroma of dried fruit (raisin, figs, etc.) At the first sip, you can appreciate the coffee-like bitterness being balanced out by the syrupy sweetness of the malt.  This is a super-thick-bodied beer with a stickiness that should be enjoyed in small doses.","Plainfield, Illinois, USA","popephred"

Flavor leads off with more of the same, plums, cinnamon, nice, but overall is dominated by the molasses. Strong, leathery, blackstrap molasses, somewhat mineral in character. Interesting, but I cant say I care for it as the primary characteristic of a stout. Thick, full body, very smooth and viscous, potently warming.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","noncaloric"

1016,"2010-01-24",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 2, 2010 2009 bottle, sampled at the Great Imperial Stout tasting in Boise 1/16/10 8_4_5_3_15 3.6 overall 
Appearance: Thick, black with a small brown head 
Aroma: Roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and alcohol 
Taste: Bitter (hot) alcohols, sour, roasted malts, coffee 
After a night of having some Awesome Imperial Stouts, this was a disappointment from all the hype. The aroma was great, but the taste was mostly hot alcohols and sour at first. There were several at the tasting that said the same thing. I would like to try this beer again after aging for a few years. Im sure that would mellow out the alcohol. 
7/30/10: I was finally able to try another year. 2007 bottle thanks to footbalm. 
Much smoother mouthfeel. Nice dark malts and chocolate. The alcohol is very well hidden. Aging this beer is a must.","Utah, USA","Sledutah"

1016,"2010-01-23",5.0,"UPDATED: JAN 24, 2010 Bottle. 22 oz. (2008 - White Wax) Gift courtesy of my good friend Vinny. This beastly, epic brew comes sealed in a dripping, candlewax-sealed, shiny bottle with a badass evil lord destroying foes on the label. Pours straight cola, dark chocolate black with a thin, creamy amberish-red head that fades quickly. Aroma of raisins, figs, dates, walnuts, plums, vanilla, chocolate, espresso, barley, roasted malts, toffee, caramel, oat, and hints of coriander and pepper. Heavy, deep body with a rich, velvety-full mouthfeel. Finishes with a slow, insane warming through the throat and entire chest. Alcohol is nearly invisible.

1016,"2010-01-11",4.3,"2008 vintage.

Pitch black with a small brown head. The liquid is really viscous.

Huge aromas of roasted malts and dark chocolate. Some dark bread, soy sauce and licorice and molasses. A rich and powerful smell.

This one really fills the whole mouth with flavors. Every sip is like getting hit by a tidal wave. Roasted malts all around, sweet dark chocolate, more sweet toffee, coffee and caramel. Every now and then, a slightly burnt flavor develops. Woody notes. The taste is predominantly sweet. The finish is quite bitter with big notes of well integrated alcohol, salt, hints of licorice and soy sauce, and perhaps some hop notes.

Mouthfeel is off the chart on this one. Ridiculously big body, viscous like old engine oil and smooth beyond belief.

So, what to say about this one, the dark lord, one of the white whales? Well, its just a great beer. Fantastic mouthfeel, rich and powerful taste, and very complex. However, its a little on the sweet side, so its not perfect. But I actually think it manages to live up to its reputation.

1016,"2010-01-10",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 11, 2011 My 600th rating.  22 oz. bottle from DLD 2009, tried three times since then (and the 2008 that day), but this was a 2009 edition opened on January 8, 2010.  Wow, this is every bit as good as I remember.  Pours opaque black and looks like motor oil, with a little bit of brown head forming at the top but not amounting to much.  The aroma is beautiful, and so complex: molasses, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, hops (more than I remember), cherries, plums, roasted nuts, smoked wood, and a dirty, earthy note.  So much to take in.  Somehow the flavor is even better, as good as anything Ive ever tasted- rich, robust, complex, and smooth.  It starts with chocolate and coffee, with molasses and vanilla followed by some earthy hops, and finishing with roasted malts, dark fruits (especially cherry and plum), more coffee, and a smokiness reminiscent of a hickory-smoked meat.  The alcohol is perfect in this, warming and complementary.  This is absolutely perfect in the mouth: full-bodied, incredibly smooth, oily, warm, and rich.  Finishes with lingering smoke, roast, hops, and chocolate/vanilla sweetness and a sticky mouthfeel.  This absolutely lives up to the hype and I wish I didnt love the drinking experience so much or Id age a couple bottles.  Hopefully my last two can last without being opened.  Worth a trip up to Munster every year for DLD for the experience and the beer, and not many beers are worth such a trip.  This is quite simply my favorite beer, and unless I ever find something thats perfect in every single way, this is probably as close to 5.0 as Ill get.  Mind-blowing imperial stout, the gold standard for monster beers. Re-Rate: Based on the 2006-2011 tasting at my place on my bachelor party weekend, Id like to get this rating more in line with my other top-tier beers, including the other versions of Dark Lord. The Pappy/Bourbon/Oak is the best in my book, followed by the De Muerte, Vanilla Bean, Brandy, and Brandy Vanilla. The normal one is somewhere in the middle, better than the Brandy Vanilla but not on par with other barrel treatments. I say that because the newest one in particular is not up to par for me. 2008 is still my favorite, with 2007 and 2010 right behind, then 2006 and 2009. But 2011 in particular is what is making me bump this down just a bit and average it out. The dark fruits really take the drivers seat in this years edition and the body seems lighter. Still one of my favorite beers ever but this rating is more a correction to my early-rating enthusiasm.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

I was extremely excited to try this one to say the least and I am reliving my excitement as I transfer my notes on here....ok back to the rating.  Strong intense nose of cocoa, dark cherries or dates, smoke, and splendidness. The flavor is outstanding leaving my mouth begging for more. Sweet molasses melds with dark cherries, chocolate, and roasted coffee. Also detect a hint of burnt something-or-other. A bit of alcohol becomes evident at the end.

2004: Pours thick black, no head, reddish tint.  Aroma has anise, slight booze, vanilla, molasses, slight dark fruit and some char.  Taste is caramel, vanilla, some butter, moves nicely into some roasty notes and finishes very dry.  Touch thin, but not too bad.  Overall can tell its on its way down.
7,3,7,4,14 - 3.5

2005: Thick black pour with nice thin lasting tan head.  Aroma has big notes of chocolate, coffee, molasses, roast, vanilla, and some slight dark fruit.

8,4,9,5,16 - 4.2

2006: Pours very dark black with thin tan head.  Aroma has notes of lots of vanilla, chocolate, anise, coffee, with a surprising addition of wonderful dark fruit notes.  Taste is sweet and slightly bitter chocolate, leads into dark fruits with dates and slight red raisin, notes of roast and coffee with molasses, finishing bitter and dry.  Great, balanced, full mouthfeel.
8,4,9,4,17 - 4.3

2007: Pours hazy brownish black with tan head.  Aroma has notes of sweet chocolate and coffee mixed, nice dark fruit again with slight vanilla, molasses and toffee.  Taste is chocolate-y, with slight hints of dark fruit and coffee, some nice sweet vanilla leading to molasses, toffee, some roast and booze.  Finishes dry and slightly sweet.
8,4,8,4,15 - 3.9

2008: Pours thick black, tan head.  Aroma finally has notes of some hops, but its a bit overwhelming.  Pine, fruit in the aroma mix with the chocolate, molasses, toffee, coffee, vanilla.  Taste is very hoppy still, notes of pine and resin, fruity notes work into chocolate, molasses and vanilla, finishing harshly bitter and slightly boozy.
7,4,8,4,15 - 3.8

2009: Poured thick black with deep molasses and licorice aroma.  Complex hops at the beginning followed by anise and molasses and finishes well with a smoky/hop bitter ending.  A bit hot, sweet, but the coffee finally makes a nice appearance.
8,4,8,5,13 - 3.8

2010: Poured very oily black with tan head.  Aroma is boozy, vanilla, some slight coffee, chocolate, and molasses.  Taste is boozy, sticky sweet, vanilla and toffee bomb, some slight bitter coffee and chocolate, and a hot finish.
7,4,7,4,13 - 3.5

2011: Poured thick black with tan head.  Aroma has notes of coffee, vanilla, toffee, some sweet chocolate.  Creamy on the palate, coffee dominates the taste in the beginning and works into chocolate, vanilla and toffee, molasses, finishes a bit sweet and slightly boozy, but overall taste hides the booze fairly well.

I expected a straightforward bomb of an imperial stout, but this is so complex and so nice. Flavor is incredible; lots of coffee, rich chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and clear booze notes. The dark fruit becomes more subtle, but those notes of date, fig, and raisin are still present. There is a really nice toasted almond, walnut, and hazelnut note; adding the sweetness to that, it borders on a Nutella feel.

Anyway, it pours a small head with an immediate chocolate nose and big chocolate taste. This is sweet. The next flavor is cherry and chocolate and then a very nice salty note toward the end. Im liking this a lot and it does run a great complexity of flavor that is pretty uncommon for something this sweet. There is no sense of alcohol at all other than a warmth on the finish.

1016,"2009-11-04",4.1,"2009. Solid black pour, dark brown foam that surprisingly dissappeared completely. Not really that thick appearing, not much lacing either.

It is sweet, but I dont think its too much. Flavors does match the aroma, roast and sweet from malt, molasses, something like a chocolate ball with port in it and just hints of espresso and anise. Thats probably the one place would have like a little more of, roast and bitters. I was surprised by that considering 3F likes to hop the heck out of things. 
Drinkability is actually fine to me, as I dont get any over sweetness from this. Its actually quite good for a beer this big. Ive heard 09 is a more drinkable batch up front without having to let it age. I pretty much agree, reminds me more of American/Double, which I prefer, even though the difference is subtle. Im not going to give this all 5s, but definetely lived up to expectations.

After some warming Ill change my tune a bit. The sweetness does kind of overtake this one after a bit. Reminds me of some of the Weyerbacher stouts. Of the A+ RISs, I still put Abyss a notch above.","from Michigan now in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","timsilvia32"

1016,"2009-09-18",4.3,"Bottle, 2009 vintage, with enormous thanks to MrBunn.  Pours black with 1 - 1 and 1/2 fingers of brown sugar head.  Aroma is very intense, coffee, cocoa, cherries, booze.  The foam is really lasting on the brew too, leading me to expect some significant carbonation in the mouthfeel.  I was wrong.  The mouthfeel is thick, as others have mentioned, and the flavor is more strongly of the coffee, fruits (cherries) and something approximating breadiness than I would have expected.  All of this is just a preamble, however, to the strong boozy burn here.  I wouldnt say the alcohol is poorly disguised, only that it fights its way through in the end.  Lots of sweetness here, but the cocoa from the aroma is all gone.  Raisins, anise, and the slightly sour cherries bring it all.  Interesting.  Id been ""warned"" that I might not love this beer, but I do.  Its definitely unique, but thats a good thing.  I do agree, however, that I couldnt make a 2 bottle night out of this.","San Diego, California, USA","gorditoabd"

The aroma is of very strong coffee, licorice, milk chocolate, and fruit. The taste is very sweet and thick, almost chewy. The main flavors that hit me are fig newtons and prune juice. On further exploration, however, a more complex character comes out, mostly of dark, sweet fruits. Dates, fig, raisins. The mouthfeel is oily and port like with low carbonation. The sweetness gives way to a nice roasted coffee finish. A very luxurious beer that mostly lived up to my high expectations.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
1016,"2009-09-14",4.0,"2009 vintage shared by JMerritt. Pours a dark black with a red Merlot red to it. Almost no head but the thin layer of bubbles produced a dark tan color. Beer had a med/heavy carbonation rated and was pretty viscous when poured. Aroma had a very strong prune fruit note, chocolate, lots of alcohol, some raisin with a slight soured malt note at the end of the nose. Flavor was composed of first chocolate followed by a slightly bitter coffee bite, then a dark fruit, vanilla and ended on a strong molasses flavor. The beer itself is very chewy and high alcohol presence gives it an almost wine-like feeling. Good brew overall but I definitely see this one as a one time offering as it is pretty much good as an ""extreme"" beer but not an every day type of drink.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"

As I took my first sniff I was afraid it may not live up to the hype. Smelled sweet with notes of molasses, brown sugar, cocoa, and a bit of dark fruit. It almost reminded me of a Lagunitas stout. My fears were quelled however as soon as I took a sip. Oh man that is some good stuff! The first thing I noticed was how thick it was. Like a big gulp of chocolate milk. Then the taste spread over my eager tongue. Notes of dark chocolate, coffee, and molasses. As it got a bit warmer I picked up a hint of earth and herbal mint buried deep within its murky depths. It was very sweet for an RIS but had enough bitterness to keep it in check. The finish was divine as well. I could taste dark chocolate and espresso for minutes after a swallow.

The dude at FFF was pouring out of a pitcher very slowly, however, so that might have had something to do with it. The smell is--whoa--sweet and boozy. Ive heard about how well Dark Lord hides the 13%, but there it was, assaulting my nose with its harshness. Once you get past it, there are some nice notes of coffee, bourbon, and sweet malt. But its just too overpowering. Taste is more of the same, a sugary, boozy mess that just falls apart.

Swirling the glass produces a thick oily residue and a thick tan head that then falls off quickly and leaves a sticky stained glass looking residue on the walls of the glass.  Caramel, chocolate, roast malt, light coffee, and just barely an undercurrent of sweet alcohol. Velvety oily body.  Remarkable mouthfeel.

1016,"2009-08-05",3.4,"09 bottle.  So for my 300th rating, I decided to have Dark Lord.  I had high hopes, which usually leads to a letdown, so I decided to trick myself a bit to prevent this.  I decided to do a blind tasting with Expy, 110K+OTB2, Founders Impy, and Speedway.  I figured this way I would get my true opinion on it and not my worried letdown opinion.  Well, needless to say, there was still a letdown.  Pours a thick black with brown hue, absolutely no head to be seen whatsoever (upon tasting, but was able to coax a thin dark tan head out with farther pour), lots brown lacing around glass.  Aroma is very solid of coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruits, some tart fruits, molasses, roasted malt, caramel, and hints of vanilla.  First sip threw me for a loop.  Cloyingly sweet, boozy, ever so slight tartness disguised many of the good properties of the brew.  No hops detected at all.  Mouthfeel is heavy and creamy.  If it didnt smell so good and look so nice, this would have been a much lower rating.  I have an 07 and 08 bottle in the cellar that I will have to try to see if age helps this, but man, I am really starting to believe this is all hype and no substance.

2009 Bottle poured into a thick walled Chalice. Oh how the Czars would envy me.
Pours a deep black profuse sludge as if the Dark Lord himself has awakened from a slumber of centuries past. Already I can smell the scent of deep roasted malts, coffee, smoked embers, and nutmeg. The lacing clinging to the walls of my glass, but sliding ever so smoothly into the depths of midnight, where light ceases and something a bit abnormal begins. The first sip; smooth, chewy and thick. Perhaps this Lord of Darkness plays well with others? A robust hit of roasted chocolate careens my palate confused as to what it wishes to unleash next. A rush of sweet molasses and plum forces its boldness upon my senses. As the ferocity of the sip hits my palate a hint of nutmeg and cherries sneaks in through the back with hops infused in the grain. A strong but short burst of burnt and smoked woodiness ends atop the alcohol, clearly there can be no more. But the taste lingers and finally rests into a roasted smoked chocolate embrace. Its enough to want to follow the Dark Lord into the underbelly, into the darkside, into the grave. And after sampling the elixir of this Demigod, I must pledge my loyalty to he who is the master of the blackest of nights, the overseer of the underworld of sludge, and the purveyor of all that is ""not normal"". To the Dark Lord.","beavercreek, Ohio, USA","raninator84"

1016,"2009-07-27",3.0,"I decided yesterday to make the day special by cracking open a 09 bottle.

A white wax topped bottle split between three of us in snifters. The bottle poured really thick like used motor oil but leaving almost no head. We tried to conger one up but to no avail. Maybe a bad bottle clue number one. The body of the brew was a typical black stout color with ruby highlights around the edge.

One of us pulled a cardboard aroma, clue two on the bad bottle? I got an initial chocolate note followed by rubbing alcohol, yes this thing is big and boozy. I cant wait to sample the 07 see how that one stacks up.

The flavor was very roasted and hot. The last sip I got some nice dark fruit in there as well. To say the body on this brew was full would be an understatement. I do wish there would have been some carbonation on it.

Drinking the brew was a treat. Like I said I have a few more bottles and I will be revisiting this one. I think some of my score on this bottle may have been from a bad bottle. It happens I know. I will rescore after I drink the next bottle. I know the scores should go up but wanted the brewer and others to be aware of a slightly oxidized bottle from a fresh batch.","Skowhegan, Maine, USA","Pastor"

From a bomber into a Reidel Vinum Cab glass on Election evening...

Huge, ultra-viscous espresso/motor oil body topped by a thin brown sugar/sweet potato-colored head. Impressive.

Sweet husky double-espresso roasted malt with abundant hop presence of pleasant grass and even some leather. Alcohol blends well but makes its presence known. Definitely a pumpernickel feel with sweet hazlenut caramel finish. Some dates, figs...even some pomegranate? Salty, husky feel to an extent. Balance in over-abundance.

Creamy, velety, silky huge 3XL roasted coffee/chocolate malt presence. Hops emerge in force with grass and slight pine notes. Theres even some burnt popcorn. Ya gotta a whole lot goin on here...

Mouthfeel is well...involved...syrupy as hell with a whole lot of coffee grounds and grill char layered on top; with warmth this balances out with more brown sugar sweetness. A little more synergy would do this wonders; finish is of course heavy as an anvil in a Roadrunner cartoon. Some salty leather in here, too.

One word for this: Bountiful. Maybe not a stellar example of Beautiful Chemistry but the abundance of well...everything has good closing speed and makes this a showstopper.

Aroma is of overly ripe fruit, cherry, prune, plum, a little alcohol but not as much on the nose as anticipated. More cherry comes out the more I sniff it. Now the flavor: Flavor is just everything you could imagine in an impy and more; Rich sweet dark fruit, heavy malts of course, sweet dark chocolate, brandy. Flavor is just so complex and intense, its difficult to even describe. Just amazing though - not ""over the top"", but amusingly, daringly (and deliberately) so close thereto; This one so gracefully straddles the line between mind-boggling intensity and sheer insanity.

One could wax poetic about the layers all day, this is a sipper for contemplation and an overrwhelming experience at the same time.  Virtually no carbonation.

08- Pours thick thick black with a thin mocha head which dissipates quickly leaving a dark brown hue at the rim of the snifter.  The lacing on the glass cant really be called lacing as it is more of a brown sediment which coats the sides.  Aroma is extremely complex - dark dark chocolate, dark fruits cherries and raisins, espresso, smoky soy sauce, vanilla, even bourbon.  Flavor follows through with the great aroma - bittersweet chocolate and dark cherries dominate, molasses, vanilla, espresso, soy sauce, and hops and bitter roasts in the finish.  Extremely thick and chewy mouthfeel.  This beer is an experience - not as good as the oak aged version but close.
09- Pours jet black with similar head, thinner than 08 with not near the amount of sediment on the glass or the brown hue at riim. Aroma is tons more boozy than 08, but dark chocolate and cherries still present, almost has a rum quality to the aroma.  Taste is dark chocolate and cherries, much more alcohol warmth and not near the complexity.  Much thinner mouthfeel as well.  Put this one back a few years.  08 very enjoyable now though.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","mcmd"

Final at a tasting, Many thanks DSG for sharing this one, for 2 days I am running in my mind the experience of tasting the Dark Lord, although I have tasted less than 200 beers so far I know this one is exquisite, I am sure that brewing a good beer is a complicated mission but combining the flavors into that presented in the Dard Lord is a work of art. As a coffee & chocolate lover (or even liver), finding a beer that combines these two with a beer in such an obvious way made me sip the 50ml slowly, very slowly verrry verrrry sloooowly. OK. It pours total black with medium milk chocolate head, aroma is powerful and pleasant, with some nicely roasted coffee beans, nice dark chocolate and dried fruits like risians, nuts could be sensed as well. Flavor is very deep, dark chocolate, well blended coffee, dried fruits, cherry liquer, balanced with low bitterness and acidity and finishes with some spices like cinnamon and clove.

Simultaneously the biggest beer I have ever had (along with the BCS from Goose Island) and one of the most drinkable Imperial Stouts- a notch above Bells Expedition in the latter regard. Pours a viscous black motor oil that sticks like grease to the sides of the glass as you swill it- this one left a thick stain on my finger nail. Deep Sienna head that diminishes fairly quickly to release a complex nose of chocolate dried fruit, liquorish (very evident!), raisins, coffee and what have you. The flavor does the aroma due justice. Mouthfeel is full and thick, yet it goes down very easily.

Black wax, poured pitch black forming a dark brown foamy thin head.  Aroma was of caramel, with brown sugar, licorice.

1016,"2009-05-02",4.7,"I was prepared to be disappointed by this brew due to my high expectations but it actually met them.  Thus far only tried it on tap.  Pours dark as night with modest head.  ARoma of vanilla, and roastiness.  Flavour is in perfect balance to me, can taste the hoppiness expected from an imperial and the roasted sweetness of the malts but neither is dominant.  This allows for other flavours especially vanilla with some caramel and coffee to come through.  The most amazint thing was how well the alcohol is hidden.  Great brew, amoungst my favs","barrie, Ontario, CANADA","yumyum"

1016,"2009-05-01",4.7,"22 oz bottle, 2008 edition, sent to me by the ever generous Acknud. Pours black as a moonless night in the country with a tiny brown ring of lace. Aroma is heavy with molasses, malt and vanilla. Probably the thickest, heaviest palate Ive yet to experience in a beer. This pours so thick you could pour it on pancakes. Now theres an idea. Darklord for breakfast. Flavor is a wonderful combination of molasses, roasted malts, chocolate with a hint of vanilla bean. Alcohol tries to stay hidden, but at 13% it cant hide long. Finishes bitter with a real alcohol bite. This was a terrific drinking experience.","Wilton, New Hampshire, USA","mcox90"
1016,"2009-05-01",4.4,"Bottle. 2008 version. Medium high and lasting creamy brown head leaving long lacings. Pitch black body. Mild and yet powerful roasted barley malt aroma with coffee choccolate and fruity notes as well. Spicy coffee choccolate vanilla fruity strong roasted malt flavor as well as a good deal of hops bitterness, low carbonation and a long bitter aftertaste. The best of all is however that the brewers have managed to keep the alcohol at a subdued level both in aroma and flavor even at such a high alcohol percentage. Awesome.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Skinnyviking"
1016,"2009-04-30",3.4,"Here is an 08 vintage, close to a year old now.

Appearance - Wow... Is there anything that is darker than ""black?"" I guess if ""Dark Lord"" were a color then yes, there would be something blacker than black. Has very little head to it after an aggressive pour. The head that it does have is absolutely beautiful in color, very Abyss like, possibly a little more red in hue. A little mocha ring is left after the head has subsided. This beer has some legs too, motor oil kind of legs.

Smell - Very sweet. Almost sickeningly sweet smelling. Lots of dark, dark chocolate. I can smell the alcohol too, seeing as its 13% I expected that. Lots of vanilla, smells like its been aged in bourbon. There is some molasses too in there as well, very complex.

Taste - Wow, talk about sweet. This is candied beer for crying out loud. Tastes like an alcoholic chocolate milk, except much thicker. Faint taste of burnt dark fruits in there, mostly a plum aftertaste. I cant get past how sweet this is...

Mouthfeel - Damn, perfect. I love my beers thick and viscous, and this one tops them all. I thought the Abyss had the perfect mouthfeel, but it has been beaten. The thickness of this monster is going to hurt its drinkability though. That is where the Abyss reigns king in my world. Minutes after taking a sip I can still taste the beer in my mouth, probably because it is still there. 

Drinkability - This hurts a little from the fact that it is soooo sweet and soooo thick. I love the thickness, but this is definitely a ""share with your friend"" kind of bomber. I am going to have a hard time finishing this one.","Salem, Oregon, USA","josephselander"
1016,"2009-04-28",4.9,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2009 2007 (Silver Wax) bottle. Thick black pour with a thin brown head. I couldnt take my nose out of the glass. Chocolate, coffee, toffee, vanilla, and a slightly fruity nose. It was all there. Every sip brought a little something more as it warmed to room temperature. There was very little to no alcohol present at the start, then started to peek through as the beer warmed up. An amazing complexity of dark chocolate, molasses, vanilla, coffee, toffee, dark roasted malts with a noticeable fruit berry flavor. Its a seriously deep beer, and the longer you let the beer roll over your tongue, the better it gets.","oak creek, Wisconsin, USA","Scoobs"
1016,"2009-04-28",4.9,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2011 Jesus God.  Really.  2009 bottle my roommate brought back from DLD.  Nose is...everything.  Super creamy chocolate, coffee molasses.  So sweet smelling, like candy almost.  Head is nearly non existent.  The flavor is sweet and smooth.  Absolutely nothing stands in the way of anything else.  The chocolate is unlike anything Ive had in a beer before and leaves a very unique impression on the palate as it makes love with the coffee and molasses.  Never had I drank a beer so perfectly balanced that you can taste every nuance individually and as a whole.  This is the best beer Ive ever had.
------- Dark Lord.  On tap at FFF after DLD:

2011 batch on tap at FFF after DLD.

A: Its Dark Lord. Thick, black sludge with a tan head.  Its got more legs than your grandmas wine stash. It absorbs light.

S: I wasnt expecting the nose to be such a coffee bomb, but it was. There was plenty of sugary sweetness and serious roasty malt character, but coffee is certainly at the forefront.

T: Absolutely fantastic. Much more balanced and less angular than 2010s batch. Not as hot as youd expect being 15%. This is very sweet - but again, its kept in check with bitterness not just from hops, but highly roasted malts and coffee. Theres a fair amount of dark fruits in there, but coffee seems to champion the flavor profile.  FFF got this one nearly perfectly balanced.

M: Dark Lord wouldnt be Dark Lord if it wasnt a thick, oily, sludge hanging out in your mouth. Itll tattoo its flavors onto your tongue. Very thick.

O: Hype or not, believe what you will - 2011s Dark Lord is world class beer fit for kings. Im very happy to have gotten it on tap so I didnt have to pop one of my bottles. This is a beer to be drank for the most special of occasions. Well done, FFF.  Bravo.","Kettering, Ohio, USA","CptGreencoat"
1016,"2009-04-26",4.2,"Sampled this at DLD 09 on tap, but my rating is based off the 09 bottle version. Pours a thick, straight black body. It also has a nice reddish glow towards the edge of my snifter. It truly does look like syrup coming out of the bottle. The head is a paper-thin, dark brown that dissipates immediately and leaves a delicate swirl on the surface. The lacing on the glass is an abundance of dark brown oils that looks like it has been stained by soy sauce. The aroma is surprisingly sweet. It has a noticeable vanilla and woody bourbon to it, which makes it seem like a combination of the Vanilla Bean DL and the Barrel Aged DL. There is a good amount of molasses to this as well. Probably the most molasses Ive ever encountered. Lots of rich, dark chocolates and a very soft roast and coffee. The hops are noticeably that FFF bright, earthy citrus, but are not as bold as I would have expected. They are pretty reserved. The flavor is just what the aroma leads it to be. Much sweeter than anticipated, although it does have a nice touch of roast, coffee, and bittering hops. The vanilla is distinct, along with lots of rich chocolates and molasses with more of a sweet lingering taste than overpowering roast/bitterness. The finish is smooth, rich, and slowly dries. Palate is full, thick, and very round. Overall, a great Imp Stout and worth every penny/mile driven/time waiting in line to experience DLD. The people at FFF really did a great job this year. Much better than 08. As for the beer, its a very well balanced Imp Stout. The thickest body you will ever come across. Not as hoppy or roasty as others out there, but very rich and flavorful. A great marketing tool for FFF.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Thick mouthfeel, bursting flavor, an explosion of thick, rich roasty coofee, dark chocolate bitterness. More hops than I expected, huge dry lingering finish..Totally lived up to the hype. AWESOME!

DLD 10. Excellent again, but maybe not quite what the 09 was. This might be because 09 was my first DLD and it blew me away, almost impossible to be totally objective about 09 and for 10 to measure up.","Centerville, Ohio, USA","clingman71"

Aroma is really interesting with liquorice, fudge, chocolate and roasted coffee. A bit vinous too, this was the 2007 edition. Flavour was big with lots of bitter dark chocolate, some fudge, liquorice, coffee and some sweet milk chocolate (lots of different chocolates, I wrote down). Very fullbodied, thick, almost chewy mouthfeel. Quite insane.","Karlstad, SWEDEN","Ljunkan"
1016,"2009-04-26",4.3,"Poured draft on DLD 09 (Munster, IN) several times with the free pours from my tickets. Pours a dark blackish pour with brown edges, thick and opaque, with a brownish head that eventually settles down and clings. Aromas are heavy on some roasted malt and coffee dominant, as chocolate and caramel round out the top. Coffee takes a leading role, but is kept contained by the others. Initial is rich and a touch sweet, pushing heavy dark malts of coffee and chocolate with some good roast. Light bitterness from coffee and hopping comes into the fold further in, helping to balance the finish. Roast and coffee take the stage, linger on the palate, and aftertaste. Thick and very good mouthfeel. You definitely know you are drinking this. The alcohol doesnt come in as strong as one would think, hides well among the strong flavors this brew preaches.

Pours a thick completely opaque black color, with a half-finger high chocolate-y tan head. Really no words can describe how thick and gorgeous it is. Smells of so many things: chocolate, roasted nut, dried fruit (comes out more when warmer), coffee, vanilla, a bit of alcohol, and some bourbon (and maybe even more). The taste is similar to the smell, but is amazing because it layers the flavors so it is multi-tiered, first tasting one flavor, then slowly flowing to another. Covers the mouth, and feels sticky like molasses, with the vanilla coming in on the aftertaste. Truly an amazing beer, and Im very glad to have experienced it, and makes me cant wait for DLD 09.

I got the dregs of the bottle with all the sludge, I like sludge, but this was kind of ridiculous sludge. The most viscous opaque brown Ive ever seen, with legs and it smells oddly of beef jerky? Interesting. More chocolate and toffee than anything else other than this weird beef jerky aspect I seem to get. Smells nice though. The flavour is just insane, instantly hitting all corners of the mouth. Coffee, toffee, extremely full mouth-feel, very impressive! Same meaty aspect I mentioned. Yeasty too. Wow.

1016,"2009-03-29",4.7,"UPDATED: SEP 4, 2009 A: I peeled back the wax and popped this bad boy open. I swear I saw smoke coming from inside the bottle, was I imagining this or was there really smoke? This is the absolute darkest beer known to man.... Period! Black does not start to describe this beers color. That being said as I swirl the glass I see hints of red popping thru. It pours with the consistency of 10W40 motor oil with a nice two finger espresso colored head that settles down nicely. I see some mud at the bottom of the glass, cant wait to consume that, I may pour it over ice cream. There is no lacing, but the glass appears to have been dipped into oil. The contents of this bottle may be the remains of the Exxon Valdez spill as there is an oily film left behind as the contents disappear.

S: Very complex. You really have to concentrate to pick out the aromas. I smell dark espresso, vanilla, prunes, raisins, and a hint of alcohol, port wine maybe? Pure goodness in a bottle.

T: Ah yeeeessss. I really like this one. Some of the finest malts on earth must have been used to brew this stuff. I can confrim it is not the remains of the Exxon Valdez what it is though is one great beer. The first thing that comes to my mind here is rich creamy chocolate cake. There is an overload of chocolate at first. As it oozes down my throat and believe me it oozes there are notes of cherries, plums, raisins, currents, and a hint of smoke. This is one complex brew. Danger Will Robinson I am in Sensory Overload.

M: You could chew this one, put it in a pan and bake it and you would have Fudge. In all honesty this is a thick brew but it is so rich, creamy and smooth. BRAVO!

D: Obviously at 13% ABV and the cost this is a one bottle brew. But it is one of the most enjoyable bottles of beer you will ever consume.

Overall: Move over Slimfast we now have a meal in a bottle instead of a can. This one is so ever filling. It leaves your belly so full and your insides warm and tingly. After consuming this beer you will forget all about calories. As for the hype related to this beer; what hype? This beer lives up to the billing. 3 Floyds takes great care in making this beer and it is deserving of its own day for release.

Dark chocolate, dried fruit, super malty and roasty, light alcohol, all nicely mellowed with age, adding a light oxidized touch to the nose.   The flavor is intensely coffee packed, dark chocolate laden, and fruit filled, while also being hoppy and pretty bitter.   This stuff is just so thick, I cant even describe it.   Definitely the thickest beer Ive ever had.   Honestly, the verdict is out on whether beer should even be this thick, but I have to give it a 5 just for accomplishing that.   Definitely unique and intense stuff.   It is hugely rich and sweet, yet seems to pull off a pretty good balancing act.   Big thanks to Tom for pulling this out.   A great way to end my time in DC.

Rerate: 2009 bottle thanks to kp on the RBSG09 bus.   This was way hotter and  more bitter than the aged version that I first had, and seemed more syrupy in its sweetness.

Aroma is fantastically full of dried fruit, chocolate, toffee, a touch of vanilla and a bit salty.  Flavor is superbly balanced with alot of everything but not too much of anything.  Roasty, chocolatey, a touch of coffee and everything else that was in the aroma.  Full bodied is an understatement.  This stuff is almost cough syrup thick.  Maybe a little too thick, but as good as it tastes it doesnt really matter.  A fantastic brew, definately in my top 5 list of stouts.","Alta Loma, California, USA","mspindler"
1016,"2009-02-27",3.9,"Many thanks to JRob for sharing this bottle of stouty goodness with me.  What a huge beast of a beer. The name quite suits it. Pours deep, dark, oily black.  Lovely complex aroma, coffee, chocolate, with some dark fruity notes as well. Flavor equally complex, thick in the mouth, with a touch of bitter at the end. Definitely not for everyday consumption (or for the fainthearted), but worth the effort it takes to find it.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","AtlAggie"
1016,"2009-02-25",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 27, 2010 Re-Rate:  Sorry, but the 2009 and 2010 versions havent been up to par.  The 2007 was outrageously good.  Newer versions are sweet and syrupy, to the point of cloying.  I hope 3F gets their act together and produces another batch like 2007.

Thanks to JMFG for finally getting me a taste.  It was worth the wait.  2007 vintage.  Both aroma and flavor have some amazing complexity with chocolate, raisins and vanilla flavors dominating.  The alcohol is almost non-existent in the flavor, as the other flavors mask it very well.  This is a delicious beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","GodOfThunder"

Pitch black pour, this beer is like a black hole, no light will escape. Crazy thick, this is really old motor oil. Aroma is LOADED with burnt malt, soy sauce, sweet chocolate, cocoa powder, touches of coffee, and some dark brown sugar.
Flavor is sweeeeeeeeeeet, with some notes of coffee, and lots of sweet malt. this is not as bitter as i expected, its quite balanced between the sweetness, and the bitterness. What an amazing beer, a true curl up and sip beer. i love it, and i wish it would never end. This is really true to the hype!!!!! Im in love!","Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, CANADA","robinvboyer"
1016,"2009-02-23",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2009 2007 bottle from a trade with footbalm.  Thanks again.  Poured ultra dark brown, bordering on black with a scant head that was somewhere between brown and orange.  No lacing, but a thin layer of what looked like crystallized brown sugar formed on the inside of the glass.  The aroma was thick rich cake batter chocolate.  The only other time I remember smelling chocolate that thick was in Sam Adams Triple Bock.  Cinnamon, light coffee and some hops as well.  The flavor was chocolate, cinnamon and as it opened up, some piney, earthy hops.  Lots of sugar present.  The mouthfeel was thick yet drinkable.  13% ABV was expertly hidden.  Its a big beer.

1016,"2009-02-22",4.7,"(666) Bottle courtesy of BlackForestCO.  Pours black, absorbing all light, putting forth a small, chocolate head that recedes quickly to nothing like it was pulled back into the depths of Hell.  Wow, what a nose.  Huge nose of dark fruit, raisin, plums, dates, lots of rich, dark chocolate with notes of fresh pouch tobacco and alcohol.  Mouth feel = Epic Win!  Thick, viscous and oily slick, almost velvety.  Taste is chocolate, raisin, fig, plum, roast, alcohol warmth with a Hersey Kiss finish and after.  Slightly bitter at the end.  Very sweet, just shy of cloying, which may balance out a bit with age, but for a mouth feel like this, Ill deal.  A freaking fantastic beer.  Totally worth the hype.  Wow.

Really nice aroma that lasts and lasts. Dark black body, topped with thin tan head. Viscous oily heavy body with medium carbonation. Starts and stays incredibly sweet, with viscous rich malty character- chocolate, coffee, light oak, vanilla and caramel. Alcoholic warming. Incredibly flavorul and a bit too sweet. Aftertaste is like a Hersheys Kiss with light bitter hoppy character.  This is a really fine brew with incredible flavors and profiles. My only negative critique is that it is a bit too sweet, and Id love to have it a few years from now.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"

1016,"2009-02-13",4.4,"2005 bottle split with a couple friends. Initial smell from the bottle was very good. Appearance was dark black with a small tan head that faded fast. There really was not one distinct flavor that I could pick out. The flavors really seemed melded together. The mouth-feel was viscous, sticky, and thick. The alcohol was completely hidden, maybe the aging helped. Overall, this is a really good beer but dont get caught up in the hype.

1016,"2009-02-09",4.1,"05,07,08 vertical at bockhorseys pad.  Pours oily black with a faint brown ring of foam in each vintage.  The 05 was brimming with the aroma of dark fruits, predominantly cherry, and strong notes of black licorice and bakers cocoa in the flavor.  The 07 poured like maple syrup.  Frighteningly thick.  Loaded with hersheys syrup and floral red grapes.  Next to the others, the 08 was by far the most balanced, with equal notes of bakers cocoa, roasted coffee, dark fruits, and slight lactose.  Based on this vertical, I would drink this fresh instead of aging it, as the result seems to deconstruct the balance.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","nbutler11"

Very complex aroma of chocolate, toffee, coffee, licorice and malty dark fruits intermingling together....with the alcohol weighing into the nose for effect. Poured pitch black with a dark brown head that lingered well and left good lacing on the glass. Mouthfeel was bready and chewy, and the taste was a virtual copy of the nose, with each sip accentuating a different blend of flavors. Finish was heavy, long lasting and warming, which was perfect on this cold winters night.

I had thought I didnt like it, but 2007 was pretty good.  Pours a dark syrupy oily black with an almost orange-like foamy head.  Aroma is very intense- syrupy maple, dark chocolates, tar licorice, a bit earthy and tobacco- fruity raisin and dates, and a medium almost covered up a bit too much- coffee espresso note.  Flavor is syrupy sweet, a bit too sweet but kept in balance by the dark charred malts, roasted barley dark chocoalte tar earth and licorice.  A bit astringent and tannic in the end but still petty good.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

1016,"2009-02-02",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2010 Damn near perfection in liquid form.  Had to shell out $50 on EBay to get a bottle of the 2008 vintage.  It was worth every penny.  I bow down to the Dark Lord.  Its just one of the best out there, if not the absolute best.

Pours jet black and thick as hell with a tan head.  Aroma is coffee, chocolate, sweet cherries, and roasted malt.  Flavor is huge and almost bowled me over.  Roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, molasses, maraschino cherries, other fruity notes, smoke, and other things that I cant even identify.  Mouthfeel is extremely thick and oily.  It coats your tongue and mouth and you wish the flavor would stick around forever.  Man I wish I could make it to DLD this year.
EDIT: Well, I went to DLD in 2010.  This beer was excellent on tap there and I loved the -bal aged versions.  DL 2009 and 2010 just arent up to the standard that 2008 set in my mind.  Maybe my palate has just evolved.  Dont get me wrong, its still an excellent complex beer, but after having many other great examples of this style its really not world-class.  Bumping the score down from 9/5/10/5/20 = 4.9 to 9/4/9/4/17 = 4.3.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
1016,"2009-02-01",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 5, 2009 Review #600, tasted 2/3/09.  2008 bottle, courtesy of a few generous traders, poured into a tulip during the Super Bowl.

Pours oil-slick black with a big two-finger mocha head that hangs on as a cap and leaves very good lacing.

The aroma is thick with deep, sweet, dark malts and tons of molasses and dark fruit.  Bakers chocolate and espresso show up in the background.  There are plums, raisins and dates along with a hefty alcohol burn in the nostrils.  As it warms up, the aroma really explodes.

The taste is massive with tons of dark malts, roasted espresso and dark sweet fruit.  There are hints of hops in the finish, which, along with the espresso, leave a slightly bitter finish.  The roasted character is balanced well by a molasses sweetness that underpins the explosion of other flavors.

The mouthfeel is as thick and syrupy as any beer Ive had in recent memory.  Low carbonation and slick on the palate that leaves the malts all of the tongue in the finish.

This is a huge beer and one that I am glad Ive had the opportunity to try.  Every sip seems to open up another flavor or layer that I hadnt noticed before.  I started out thinking it was a little over-hyped, but by the end of the bottle I had jumped on the bandwagon.

2006 gold wax-dipped bottle.  Tasted 7/5/09.  Big thanks to Josh for passing along this bad boy.

Compared to the 2008 bottle, this one pours with a slightly smaller head and leaves no lacing, just oily legs that cling to the glass after each sip.

The aroma is massively sweet with lots of dark fruits, licorice and dark chocolate malts.  There is much more of an old-ale type aroma than the 08 though, with some caramel and toffee sweetness that I didnt get in the 08 bottle.

The taste is the same story as the aroma with some interesting aged components showing up with a lot less heat than the fresh 08.  Lots of dark roasted malts, chocolate, licorice and a slightly toasty finish.  Im not getting as much coffee in this vintage and theres no hops left either.

Massive, thick, almost chewy mouthfeel with soft carbonation, but not enough to take away from the thick oily feel.

The 06 is a much more refined and well-rounded beer than the 08 was fresh.  That said, I actually might enjoy the huge, over-the-top, in-your-face slap in the face of the fresh version.  A slightly different beer with age on it, but still world class.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Super rich roasty , chocolate and coffee nose. Bigger chocolate flavors. Really really smooth and everything merges into a unified whole, so its very well balanced and exceptionally drinkable.

Im surprised by the no head which kind of gives it the appearance of thick black prune juice or thickened black coffee. Dense aroma jumps right out at you - chocolate, raisin, prune, port, molasses, roastiness, possible hint of wood or something old. I didnt want to waste much time sniffing and all the elements seemed to be captured with a few whiffs. Mouthfeel is smooth, thick, very lightly carbonated, fairly silky and just a touch of sticky/syrupy feel. No lacing as there is no head but there is a hazy brown film left inside the snifter. Flavor is sweet and thick - lots of dark chocolate, port and raisin with some molasses, prune and coffee roast. Not much disguising here, its pretty much all up front.

It is truly pitch black and it has a small, dark brown head, that disappears relatively quickly. The mouthfeel is oily and it draws dark brown curtains on the inside of the glass. The aroma has notes of dark fruits like plum, figs and raisin, but also dark roasted malt, citrus, licorice and dark chocolate. The flavour has sweetness and notes of dark fruits, plum, figs, coffee, licorice, caramel, a little chocolate, a touch of an angels wing, a piece of the softest cloud and a glimpse of the forecourt to hell... The finish is very long, slightly dry with a roasted bitterness and a touch of citrus. It is incredibly complex, that has a strange mellow smoothness combined with a becoming bitterness. It probably is one of the most intense beers I ever have had, and it is like a fine cognac  you sip it. It would impossible to drink a bottle on my own, and even if share it with my husband, we both feel, that it is very demanding.

1016,"2009-01-05",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 7, 2010 Pours pitch black. Dark, burnt mocha head - possibly the darkest head Ive ever seen. So incredibly thick - a pour from eight inches doesnt make a sound. Aroma is a punch in the face - chocolate, smokey meats, coffee, molasses, maple syrup. You wont believe it when it hits your tongue. This is by FAR the thickest, most mouth-and-throat-coating beer Ive ever had the pleasure to try. Un... real. Dessert in a glass. Just incredible. All the notes from the aroma come through in the flavor, with a hint of bitter hops. A great friend of mine took a sip, adopted a horrified look and proceeded to take a few timid steps back from the glass (and proceeded to rate it a 4.8). This is as close to scary as a beer could be, and I swear it feels sinful drinking it. What an appropriate name. I had no idea a beer could be anything like this - puts other beers claiming to be thick to shame. Seriously. No words. I couldnt take more than a glass... but for that glass? Unbelievable. This beer inspires masochism. And possibly diabetes.

RERATE Oct. 2010: As much as it pains me to take away my only 5.0 rating, I popped a bottle of this recently, and it wasnt quite what I remembered. Still quite an impressive ale - unbelievably thick, throat-coating chocolate and roasty molasses... but slightly boozier, and with more fruit than I remember.

Loads of chocolate, coffee (espresso), molasses, as intense as you can get.  Hints of some woodiness, a bit of the vanilla, some other cake-like notes.

1016,"2008-11-28",5.0,"2008 bottle. Stood in line for 3-1/2 hours for it. Pours a black that light can not penetrate. It is a black hole sucking up light around it, it’s so black. This is real motor oil looking. Pours out the same way oil looks when you pour it into your engine. Creamy chestnut brown head faded very quickly into a thin ring along the edge. There’s no lacing but you can tell by the smell that the molasses is gonna stick to everything! There’s a great smell of molasses and dark chocolate, plum, cinnamon, a hint of cherry and there is absolutely no coffee at all. You can also smell the 13% and it does smell amazingly delicious with all that sweetness coming up with it. This is the big boy of sippers. This beer is not for the faint of heart. you have to really be a serious Russian Imperial Stout lover to drink this beer. It’s as if someone angel had added steroids to a regular RIS recipe. Yes I said angel. This beer is how WE SHOULD ALL KNOW god exists and he wants us to be happy. Huge sweet molasses, caramel, dark bitter sweet chocolate up front, plum?/prune?, honey somewhere in the middle along with more chocolate (like frosting) and bourbon soaked cherry in the middle-end with a huge bite of sticky-gooey molasses in the very back of this bad ass MFer! Wow. And Wow again. So F’N good. This beer is surprising smooth for such a big hitter. It’s not completely full bodied but it’s very close. I think it’s a good thing because being just shy of full bodied may be why this is drinkable. It does feel like it has some thickness to it that can’t easily be split up even in your mouth. It’s what I imagined the feel (not taste) of motor oil would be. This beer is way to drinkable. And that’s both a problem and a good thing. It’s a problem because this beer isn’t available on your corner at your local store. So you savor each and every bottle and each and every sip, to the last drop. It’s limited production is what makes this beer amazing. See if I could buy this beer regularly, I’d want to drink it every day. I’d also want a steak and a huge piece of chocolate cake to help me get my fix. This beer is way too damn good! It’s like crack but in beer form. You just can’t get enough. And as soon as it’s gone, You want more, and more, and more. Can’t wait for this one to mature in my cellar. Man I’m already thinking of how to plan my next trip to DLD. This beer is top notch!

1016,"2008-10-26",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 28, 2009 [Bottle] generously shared by skyview after DLD 08. Pours motor oil viscous black with a caramel colored head. Aroma is alcohol and rubbing alcohol, vanilla, dark fruits, and sweet chocolate. Ridiculously rich mouthfeel. The alcohol is a bit more subdued in the flavor, and has lots of roasted barley, espresso, is somewhat vinous, and is extremely smooth. Leaves a thick, dark coating on the glass, and my rinsewater was darker than most bocks.

Tasting Update:
2009 Bottle. This bottle has a lot more soy sauce character than I remember. There are still tons of flavors jammed in there, but that saltiness is just way to pervasive to let slide. Unfortunate, because I heard that this was one of the better vintages. Maybe an off bottle.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","MatSciGuy"

This beer has terrific legs, leaving a brown tinting on the glass as I swirl the beer.  I was expecting this to be mostly about the coffee, and I was wrong.  The aroma is much more fruity with figs and prunes along with coffee and molasses.  The flavor is even more intense with figs, dates, prunes, coffee, rich malt, molasses, and alcohol.  A bit boozey at the finish with a bit of an alcohol burn, especially as the beer warms.  Slick mouthfeel.  Full bodied. Good stuff!","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"

Pours blacker than a thousand midnights. Thick, one-finger head is darker than any I’ve ever seen, leaving spotty dollops of lace as it recedes. A light swirl leaves thick tan sheets on the sides of the glass that refuse to fall. According to my notes: viscous as fuck. Nose is as enormous as expected, with sweet french roast coffee predominating; Chocolate, vanilla, smoke, leather and earth add serious complexity. The palate reflects the nose, in flavor and enormity. Some dark fruit flavors and sweetness add to the complexity. Mouthfeel is thick, slick, and creamy. Finish is incredibly long. Alcohol burn is not horrible, but present enough to drop drinkability a notch.

Brown sugariness, roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, oats, alcohol and wood.  Some light hints of fruit.  Dangerously drinkable as the alcohol was present but not overly powerful.

The coffee comes and kicks you in the face so much harder than so-called ""coffee"" beers do.  Its like a graham cracker is in there too.  Then the chocolate comes in.  Its almost like smelling a smore minus gross burnt marshmallow.  Flavor is where that marshmallow comes in.  Its like drinking pure liquid marshmallow for grown-ups with coffee flavors making themselves more pronounced than not.  And then its like drinking the bits of bitter cacao.  It finishes with a slight alcohol burn, but it doesnt really detract.  The body is so thick its almost like drinking syrup and can almost be difficult to swallow and kind of hangs around in the back of your throat because its like your throat cant actually take it.  Spectacular beer.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","hillfiiiiire"

More so than I would normally like, but this beer is so delicious I want it to stay there forever. Sooo smooth. Tons of chocolate and coffee in the flavor with a hint of anise and an even smaller hint of currants.

1016,"2008-10-15",4.5,"2008. Ridiculous tar black pour with a solid tan head that subsides eventually, but not too quickly. Aroma of booze, burnt malt, chocolate, chalk, plum, caramel, a hint of hop bitterness. The flavor hits pretty hard with massive chocolate and burnt malt components, molasses, booze, wood, vanilla. I’m not tasting too much coffee. Again, some mildly bitter hops in the finish, but the malt really dominates here. The mouthfeel is the real standout in my opinion - unbelievably thick and rich. Coats the mouth as it goes down. This is probably the most over-the-top brew I’ve ever tasted, and I love it. There were moments when I though that maybe it was too thick, or the flavor was too overpowering, but I can’t deny the overall greatness of this beer.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","crowderm"
1016,"2008-10-13",4.7,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2017 WOW; THIS IS AN AWESOME BEER.  This is my 400th rating, and I wanted it to be a good one - it was! A big thank you to Adrian for opening up a bottle of this, which he drove and waited for hours to get his hands on.  It is the hugest, richest, tastiest brew that I have ever had.  It seems like there is a bushel of grains, a sack of hops, and a basket of fruit in every bottle.  The pour is solid black with a little brown froth on top.  The liquid is a colloid with the consistency of a banana fruit shake.  The taste is packed with grains, malt, smoke, and coffee.  These harder flavors are matched by a rich fruitiness that tastes like cherries and plums.  Incredibly rich, yet very well balanced too.  The only weaknesses from my perspective were the aroma (a little dull); and the label (a little juvenile), but don?t let that stop you.

1016,"2008-10-12",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 30, 2009 2008 vintage.  Thanks cpferris for the trade.  Opaque black with a thin, very fine, multi-hued mocha-brown head.  Appears sticky, shimmering, and highly viscous when swirled with a dark brown slick clinging to the glass.  Aroma reeks of dark caramel and berry fruit malt sweetness with dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, and soy sauce.  This is combined with a dark roasted grain edge,  a soft hops spiciness, and a bit of a brandy-like alcohol presence.  Posesses a totally malt-driven flavor profile that is expressed across a wide range of characteristics: burnt sugar, treacle, roasted grain, coffee, chocolate, toffee--all of which is balanced with what Im sure is an absurd amount of hops that just barely manages to edge through the malt.  There are multi-dimensional alcohol flavors here as well, which are very well integrated considering the size of this beer, and is one of the most unique aspects of this beer.  It is both boozey and reigned in, integrated and forcefully expressive, resembling both Cognac and ruby port--a pleasant conundrum.  The leads us through the huge, high;y-viscous body that is completely mouth-coating.  Your palate is left totally saturated with roasted grain bitterness supplemented with hops.  Quite an experience--totally over the top.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"

The aroma is rich and decadent showing massive amounts of dark and milk chocolate, fudge, roasted coffee, dark fruits, and vanilla. The flavor is equally as impressive and complex. More dark fruits, licorice, and raisins coated in the chocolate and espresso emerge in the taste. The sweetness is balanced out by some bitterness from the copious amounts of hops and smoothed over by some vanilla. The flavors attack the palate from every angle showing it’s true depth. Full bodied and the thickest mouthfeel I’ve ever felt in a beer. The body is very visocus and smooth and coats the palate and hides the alcohol beautifully.

1016,"2008-09-10",4.7,"For a singular beer style, stouts have a huge range of variety in flavor, palate, brewing, styles, etc. the list could and probably can go on. A good stout is good. A great stout is amazing. And an amazing stout is a sensual experience that could part the heavens. Seriously, for a dark beer, the complexity, subtlety, and grace of an amazing stout could even rival some Belgians. I had heard inklings of some Dark Lord that was taking the world by storm, and I was finally able to try one, and suffice to save, the heavens were parted and the Dark Lord won over yet another convert.

The Dark Lord I had was from Three Floyds Brewing and it was the 2007 edition. In a beautiful 750ml bottle with silver wax adorning her top, it was an almost heart-breaking moment to break that lovely seal. But, knowing what temptations lay within, the trepidation lasted but only a moment, and as soon as ink black body filled my glass, turning away all attempts at any light to pierce her body, I know I was hopelessly smitten. Her liquid depths are black, viscous and oily. Gorgeous. Her nose was a sensual tease of uber rich chocolates both milk and dark along with a hint of creamy fresh cafe latte notes. Able to resist her temptations no more, I delved into my Dark Lord 2007 and was greeted by a tinge of saltiness which was quickly overtaken by a veritable explosion of chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate. Viscous but not overly so, a good weight for an imperial stout. Dark cherries mingle amidst the chocolate and faint latte notes, but overall chocolate reigns supreme and what woman doesn’t like chocolate. Dark Lords finish was smooth, velvety, and thick and lingered like a lover who doesn’t want to leave, and who am I to deny her desire.

Three Floyds Dark Lord has been raved about online, via friends, magazines, and other various avenues of communication. Usually that much hype means the beer doesn’t suck, but sometimes overhype can be just that, overhype. Dark Lord 2007 from Three Floyds deserves every miniscule iota of its hype, and more if I had a say in the matter. If I could buy a case of it, I would. Run, don’t walk to your nearest means of purchase and acquire yourself some Three Floyds Dark Lord now.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"
1016,"2008-09-10",4.7,"This bottle obtained in a trade from Meathookjones. Many thanks to you, sir. The wax seal on this bottle is a much tougher obstacle than the one on Behemoth Blonde. I did my best to stir up some foam, and got only about a half inch. But it is still lingering, somewhat thinner, almost twenty minutes later. The circle of foam that runs around the glass appears to be somewhat blood red, perhaps the victims of the dark one himself. Looking down, in the middle of the glass, a creepy eye of foam stares back at me. No cascading head as claimed on the label. 

The nose is roasty and vinous, with a piney hop profile. It seems remarkably well blended. Whoa! Holy sh!t that’s good! (as I accidentally take a gulp rather than a sip). Cherries, and other dark, overripe fruits abound. The malts taste both roasted and burnt. Dark chocolate notes are everywhere, and the hops are moderate, piney, and earthy. Absolutely no sign of the 13%ABV, except my buzz as I am drinking this rather quickly. 

Mouthfeel is very heavy and thick. Creamy, with an ever so slight carbonation. Normally, this style is not the most drinkable for me, but if I had a case, I would have had a second bottle tonight. I will not miss the next release. For me, this has lived up to the hype, if not exceeded it.

The thickness and sweetness are what really set this royal treat apart from the every day stout (and I would have a stout every day if I could). I will make it a point to visit the brewpub in 2009 to try the other varieties. I can understand where some people find this dissapointing based on the hype, but personally Im blown away simply by the uniqueness it contains.  In terms of drinking for the sake of drinking due to the hype this beer receives, it gets an A-. In terms of drinking for the creativity, uniqueness, and individualistic-ness of this beer, it gets an A+.



(re-rate) VERY, VERY, VERY special thanks to danielcurtis81 for breaking out the 07-09 vertical on the eve of his wedding (see pics on my account). 07 was extremely smooth and easy to drink and all of the flavors had blended well. 08 was my favorite of the three, and had a strong flavor that was simply remarkable. 09 was good, but seemed like it still needs a little more time for things to meld. These three bottles were split 6 ways each and it was noted beneficial to tip the bottle slightly to and fro to mix the flavors otherwise the last pours will be all the thick/foam/goodness...basically is needs blended before you pour out, so figure something out to get the optimal flavor in your shared pours. What a fantastic night...Heres to great beer!!!","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","awiseman01"
1016,"2008-09-03",4.8,"Hands down the best imperial stout i’ve ever had. 22oz Bottle, 2008 (black wax.)
VERY thick pour, motor oil and molassas consistency & color, with a small, chocolate colored head. Aroma dense and complex with roasted malts, chocolate chip cookie, hazelnuts, coffee, vanilla, maple, and just a hint of pacific northwest hops.

Palate and Flavor is strikingly complex, and at 13%, frighteningly drinkable. It tastes like roasted chocolate milk, with dominant malt notes and hints of vanilla, biscuit, toffee, caramel, and just a tiny little bit of smoke. It finishes sweet without being cloying, and just a bit of hop bitterness lingers.

Absoutly stunning.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Vav"
1016,"2008-09-03",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 7, 2009 Bottle, 2008. So I finally get to try the Dark Lord. I say ""finally"" despite only having been drinking craft beer for a year and a half, and only really took note of this beer a few months ago. Regardless, this beer is really something special. Aroma of burnt malt, tobacco, toffee, caramel, vanilla, unbelievably rich. Flavor is SO BIG with all these notes, but remarkably with all the burnt malt, all the sweet malt, all the alcohol, this beer remains what I would call exquisitely balanced. Ive never had such a ridiculously smooth, soft, BURNT beer, nor would I ever have imagined a beer so loaded like this would not be unbelievably sweet and/or alcoholic. The combination of all these things I would expect to make an overdone monster, but as I said, this was something special. Remains so drinkable to the last sip, and rich to the last sip at the same time. For me, the CLEAR winner over Speedway in a back to back sampling. Simply amazing. 9-4-10-5-20/4.8Rerate from 2009 bottle thanks to my secret santa. Lots of dark fruit notes I didnt mention the first time (doesnt mean they werent there) with much of the lovely burnt malt, vanilla, toffee tones, but lacking to me this time in balance (extremely hot), and some of the continuing nuances of the initial flavors and certainly the power of those flavors. Mouthfeel also a bit odd with small-bubble, but still mildly seltzery carbonation, not nearly as full and rich. Lots of complaints going on here, just to draw out the differences, either perceived or real, but still a tasty beer. 8-4-7-4-14/3.7; Final numbers are somewhere in between, with a slight nod to the more recent go at it.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
1016,"2008-09-02",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 31, 2009 2008 bottle courtesy of iowaherkeye (thanks Joey!!).  Ive been wanting to try this for a long time now.  I didnt think that it would, but it lived up to its reputation.  Pours an inky black with a thick but quickly disappearing dark tan head.  Aroma of super rich sweet roasted malt, caramel, molasses.  Flavor of burnt malt, toffee, molassess, caramel, vanilla with burnt toast in the aftertaste.  Super sweet and pretty heavy, but somehow super drinkable!  Not overpowering at all.  Very smooth palate!  The flavors really mesh together so well that its actually quite hard to pick them apart (and Im sure Ive done them a great injustice).  I will have to try this again soon!

Update 9/20/08: Second time around, this just wasnt as good.  Tasty, but much too heavy.  Had to downgrade my rating.
Update 7/31/09: 2009 bottle.  Aroma of dark fruits, apple, booze, and roasted malt.  Flavor is very very boozy and hot.  Wow.  This is definitely a step down from the 08 version.  Also a touch vegetal for some reason.

Some chocolate, alcohol, whiskey.  Where i was the most suprised was the thickness.  I heard it was thick, but my god, this stuff is crazy thick.  But smooth, a chocolatey aftertaste, and of course some alcohol.  I agree with garthicus, i am sweating a little bit toward the end.

1016,"2008-08-24",4.5,"22oz bottle from 2008. Drank this bottle right after Dark Lord Day ’08, but forgot to rate it. Poured black with a tan head. Surprisingly, the alcohol was not very present in the aroma. Had an ass-kickingly delicious aroma of chocolate, toasty malts, and syrup. Heavy mouthfeel of chocolate, and malts. Lingering taste of coffee. No taste of the alcohol, since it is masked behind all the heavy flavors. Is it worth the hype? Not if you drink it immediately. This evil bastard needs time to prepare for your eventual face-raping of oily chocolate and coffee goodness. It’s a waste to drink it too soon.","Burbank, Illinois, USA","BeerBunker"
1016,"2008-08-20",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2009 I hope that what im drinking wasnt ruined in transit to me it being summer and all. It pours black with a brown burnt sugar carmel colored head. aroma is alcohol, malt, with a heavy carmel scent. it tastes of bitter chocolate toasty malt and burnt caramel. this beer is punishing me at the moment. for the first time ever I think I can say that my stomach is in pain, but my mouth is in love. at first I thought that i coudnt handle this beer but its growing on me. I still in my honest opinion enjoy stones imperial stout a little more because its something i can drink easily. Please take into note that it is august and this beer was shipped via ups. 

*******Re- Rate:  Heavy chocolate aroma, some coffee, bourbon, caramel. The taste is heavy on chocolate, boozy but well masked. A million times better than my first dark lord which was bad.



************2009 White Wax:

Pours a dark brown almost black. I start pouring it and to my surprise...no head ( until the very end of the pour in which a dark brown head appears, then poof it dissipates). The aroma is huge in chocolate with some soy sauce as well. There are definitely notes of coffee and dark fruits as well in the aroma. The dark fruit aroma is more apparent than is the case with most of the imperial stouts I have tried. This years batch smells inherently different from the last. The flavor is rather fruity this year as well. I get a tinge of alcohol burn on my tongue and the finish is somewhat coffee like. 09 is a bastard and I mean that in the nicest way. Another year passes, but regardless of how hyped this bad boy has gets, it matches the expectational bar that has been set for it.","Westfield, Massachusetts, USA","dogfish120love"

Pours a pure black body with a medium swirling beige head that goes down quickly to nothing almost. The aroma is full of so much; molasses, berries, coffee, chocolate. Basically this is what Brussels would smell like if the whole city was burning. The flavor was simply amazing; tons of fruit, especially berries initially, chocolates, milk, brown sugar and roasted flavors cover everything. A smooth and dry finish of chocolates and coffee. One of the best mouthfeels ever; smooth and creamy and so very full. I was very surprised by how smooth this was, so drinkable I could drink this at six AM. Let me hope I do someday. Amazing. 2009 vintage at the Imperial Stout tasting in Boise. Very sweet, lots of nice flavors, dark fruit and roasted malts, but too thin and sweet.

Actually hard to finish more than 6 oz of this one.  It had no real coffee, hop, or roast flavors at all.  Just sugar, some chocolate nesquik, and alcohol.

In every year of this beer the hallmark is always the same.  It is an aggressive and in-your-face style of brew.  Complexity?  Not at all.  A mellow and deeply contemplative style of brew?  LOL, far from that.  No, what this beer sells is evident on its label.  It does one thing and one thing very well.  To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of the women?  Not quite.  Rather, it presents a huge singular flavor that dominates its entire profile.  A gigantic tsunami of viscosity paired with a forceful rush of sweet dates, raisons and dark fruit.  This signature profile is evident in every year of this beer.  Sure theres variances in the product: the turkish coffee/thicker-than-used-motor-oil of the 2004 or the slightly thinner and green apple flavours of the 2006.  However, dispite the variances they all display that one common characteristic that keeps stouties coming back for more.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"

Some slight soy, some slight milkiness.  Finish is huge, and very lasting.  Spicy aftertaste, almost a leafiness to it.  Incredibly dense and mouth coating.

Big, sweet vinous flavors of raisons, dates, and earthy molasses. In fact, this beer was very sweet, after about two sips i thought about checking my blood glucose level. Surely the barkeep must have mistakenly dropped some sugar cubes into my cup. I still have a bottle from 2005, hope its not this sweet.","Same Trailer, Different Park, Louisiana, USA","AmEricanbrew"

1016,"2008-05-01",4.5,"this beer poured a thick black substance with little head, but who cares? i have never seen a beer pour so thick and glug out of the bottle.

the smell is exceptional. the smell is of molasses, chocolate, toffee, raisins, dates & other pitted fruits. im not certain it gets better than this.

the taste is wonderful and consistant with the smell. ultra complex and a bit smokey tasting. little alcohol is present at first, but it settles in quite nicely. 

the mouthfeel is thick, oily, full, & sticky.

as a side note, i have also never seen a beer cling to the side of the glass like this one does. by the time i finished the beer, the entire inside of my glass was coated with a thick molasses like substance that i completely feel like i cold have scraped off and shoved down in a pipe and smoked.","biloxi, Mississippi, USA","deepsouth"

1016,"2008-04-30",4.7,"Ive tried this gem twice - Once @ the Indiana Microbrewers Fest (July 07) on tap (which is the only other time Ive heard of it being available), I figure that this was probably an 07.  It was awesome then and it was awesome @ DLD 08.  When I tried it @ the Microbrewers Fest, I felt it was over shadowed by the Kentucky Breakfast - which is great in bottles but SUPERB from a keg.  Now that I try this again and with a little age on it - its really starting to contend.  Its black as midnight, oily-thick and stains the glass like it was just used to funnel your long overdue oil change or watered-down molasses.  I didnt get much head on my pour, wouldve liked that.  It smells like chocolate, coffee, vanilla,  hops, and just the slightest hint of alcohol (which isnt bad for 13%).  Taste is quite the same as the smell but with some caramel, roasted and burnt black patent malts, molasses, and a tiny alcoholic bite at the end.  The whole taste starts off sticky and sweet (like Expedition) but then it moves toward bitterness from the roasted and burnt malts and hops - and then finally to the alcohol.  Overall, really, really excellent - worth the trip - but I dont know about the wait!","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","WolfsBlood84"

Roasted coffee and some alcohol in the nose.  A complex mixture of malt tones ranging from vanilla to coffee, with some nuts and a little fruitiness in the middle.  Smooth drinking.  The 13% does not even begin to bite.  My only complaint is that its served in such a small glass will have to get back there on DLD sometime to get a proper bottles worth.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","stoutchap"

Very sweet at first and then that strong bite of bitterness comes in. Finishes off sweet with some caramel and dark chocolate. A little too bitter for me at times, though im proud to say this is my FIRST experience with an Imperial stout. I am not sure it lived up to the hype, but nevertheless an amazing experience. Definitely top 5 beers but im not ready to say its the best. Everything is here, but the flavor just does not live up.","San Diego, California, USA","tool2scream"
1016,"2008-04-28",4.0,"2007 bottle from SpringsLicker. Thanks Jay! Pours a viscous black with a dark brown head that goes away quickly. Looks like motor oil. Aroma is vinous with notes of dark fruit, cherries, coffee, molasses, chocolate, burnt malts. It is a very nice aroma. Tastes complex, but close to the aroma. Sweet ripe fruits combined with chocolate, molasses, roasted and burnt malts, some alcohol, wood, earth. A little bitterness comes through in a dry roast and woody hoppiness. It is almost syrupy thick. It oozes down the side of the glass, almost sticking to the sides. It was pretty enjoyable, but it might be a bit over hyped, as I have enjoyed some other Imperial Stouts more. It is still pretty freaking good though!","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
1016,"2008-04-28",4.8,"UPDATED: FEB 13, 2009 2007 release on tap at Dark Lord Day 2008. I was really looking forward to trying this beer! I was beginning to doubt that this could live up to its hype. The Dark Lord proved me wrong... I received this in a 6 ounce cup that was half filled with a completely opaque black beer with a beautiful brown head that left wonderful swirls in the top of the beer that lasted throughout the duration. The aroma was the most complex that I have ever experienced... a wonderful mix of chocolate, vanilla, nuts, bourbon, coffee, burnt wood, dried fruit, and suggary malts. I literally stood there smelling this for a good five minutes. Then I took the first sip... I was hit with an excellent mix of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, burnt wood, and some alcohol in the finish. It also has a very heavy mouthfeel and is very ""thick"". It was even able to cling to the side of a plastic cup! This beer definitely looks intimidating but somehow is very easy to drink. I cannot wait to open one of my 2008 bottles! This one definitely lives up to its hype!

2008 bottle shared with nimrod and Illini08. I was a bit scared of this one because the top broke off of the bottle when I was opening it. However, I was definitely not disappointed. Poured a completely opaque black color with absolutely no head. After warming for a bit, I could smell a lot of bourbon, wood chips, dried fruits, vanilla, chocolate and coffee. This beer is by far the most complex I have encountered when it comes to aromas. The taste is absolutely incredible with a LOT of bitter chocolate and dried fruits with hints of vanilla and bourbon and coffee. The viscosity of this beer really boggles my mind. It clings to the side of the glass. Illini08 poured the beer and left a bit of sediment in the bottom. We tried drinking that after the initial brew, but was unable to because of its bitterness. I cannot wait to open another bottle in a year or two! This stuff is really enjoyable!","Streator, Illinois, USA","General66"
1016,"2008-04-28",4.6,"UPDATED: JUN 8, 2011 Poured the blackest ive ever seen in a beer with a very dark brown head. Aroma of burnt coffee, chocolate, fruits, and a hint of alcohol.

Went into this thinking theres no way it could live up to the hype and it did.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"

Taste extends the aroma with rich blend of fruit, malts, coffee and chocolate with an extremely surprising clean finish. Even though it was a heavy bodied, it was dangerously drinkable.

It is not something I would drink every day (even if I could).

Mouthfeel is thick, heavy, and a lot of alcohol warmth. Overall it is a good imperial, but it definitely didnt live up to the hype around it.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","MrStitch"
1016,"2008-04-27",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 8, 2009 2007 on tap at DLD. Dont get me wrong - this is an awesome IRS. Full of coffee, toffee, and molasses flavors. Excellent stuff. But is it worth the hype? Ive had others that were better, ones that are available year round, and in four packs. Still, its a great Impy Stout.  Pours black with minimal head. Goes down very smooth and very quickly - dangerous too because it will hit you. After sharing a 2008 - the new recipe is better, more dry, less sweet.

ON SECOND ANALYSIS: They changed the recipe for 2008. Its much better, less sweet, more coffee, more dry. In short, yummier. Its still not worth the hype, but its better than 2007.

2009 - Much more bitter than I remember it. Lots of coffee, cherry, currant and oak notes. Ends on that coffee note.","San Ramon, California, USA","Taverner"

Taste is everything you could imagine: chocolate, coffee, molasses, tobacco, plums, dark fruit, cherries, cinnamon, spice, with a well-hidden alcohol burn.

6/17/12 - After 4 years, we opened out last 2008 DL.  Unbelievably complex - worried it wasnt stored correctly but it help up great and definitely took on a thicker, almost caramel finish that coated the palate.

I would have thought it would have more pop being fresh.  It was an unexpected surprise and enjoyable to have such a smooth brew this early in its infancy.  I tasted a 07 while waiting in line and it had a much more pronounced licorice taste and flavor than a fresh dark lord.  Perhaps its just that the 08 will be a better batch.  Only time will tell.

Prominent lacing remains on the glass and draws you in for more. Rich caramel aroma, with brown sugar, licorice. Milk chocolate arouses the senses, as does strong roasted malts, mainly showing off chocolate. Flavor is through the roof. Roasted malts, caramel is very rich and substantial. Licorice and chocolate is present. Really the chocolate is big and just fantastic. So rich and smooth, obscenely easy to drink. Simply an unfair beer from Three Floyds.

1016,"2008-04-11",5.0,"UPDATED: JUL 8, 2012 Bottle from 2006 (Gold Wax) thoroughly enjoyed April 08.  Pours a dark brown, near black with a large, lasting brown head.  Aroma is simple and complete.  Sweet and chocolatey with roastiness and molassess.  Wonderful.  I can begin to rate the flavor as smooth and balanced.  A blend of sweet, roast, vanilla, molassess, and I begin to lose all interest in rating while I sit back and savor this brew.  So simple, yet so full of everything.  There is a reason this brew is so highly regarded.  Thanks to a great trader - Footbalm - for sending this gem.

Re-rate from 4/1/2009:  Bottle from 2008 (Black Wax) sampled fresh another time and this one with about a year on it.  I really dont think it can get any better than this.  After working my ass off to try as many imperial stouts as possible, this is the best one to date.  Massive aroma and taste with tons of complexity and well balanced.  Just the mouthful is ridiculous... At this point, why rate it anymore?  Sit back and enjoy the ride.

Very silky, creamy, and rich mouthful.  Tastes a little more balanced than prior tastes; malty, toffee, molasses, roast, chocolate, and light bits of dark fruits.  Delicious.

1016,"2008-03-22",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 8, 2010 This is worth the hype for sure.  Im now glad that it took me so long to get my hands on one (2007 bottle) because it gave me plenty of time to try most of the other highly rated stouts.  What really impressed me about this was:  (where to begin...) - palate - had a great, thick mouthfeel that really set it apart (I guess oily maybe).  Flavors - has all of them, it seems, yet nothing too overpowering.  Chocolate, nutty, fruity, coffee, licorice, on and on.  Every sip I would notice another flavor.  Seemed like that more lasting flavor at the end was licorice but early on it is cocoa/coffee/nutty.  

Update on 2009 bottling - tried one of those bad boys the weekend after DLD.  It was cloyingly sweet and syrupy.  Definitely needs to age quite a bit.  Ill let the rest of mine sit for about a year.  I couldnt finish the bomber.  Most of the other DLs Ive had from other years have been aged for some time, so Ill know better in the future to avoid drinking it fresh.

Update for 2010 - I think this beer is going downhill.  This was not nearly as gooey and sticky as in years past - not a lot of lacing or carbonation.  The complexity of flavors just wasnt there - not many hints of other flavors like with 2007 or 2008.  2007 was fantastic and each year has declined.  Ill let this age further but I am not overly optimistic.  Im dropping my rating on this brew significantly.  Still a great imperial stout, but not the worlds finest.","Indiana, USA","BigBang"

Not only does it contain every ingrediant under the sun, and maybe some from the underworld, that I enjoy in a stout, but it seems like I can pick out any flavor I want at any time or just let them all blend together to make a fine brew. Like the wizard of beers all I say is, ""there is no thing like a cherry stout"" and I take a sip. Bam, a top notch cherry stout flavor. Can do that with so many flavors its unbelievable.

1016,"2008-03-09",3.9,"Pours a totally opaque thick black color with thin light brown head.

1016,"2008-03-09",4.4,"Bottle, 22oz, 2007 vintage. (Big thanks to the_epeeist) Even though this is a heavenly beer, I cant get myselves to rate it higher. The reason is that its just too much, even for a lover of imperial stout like me. Like Sam Adams Triple Bock, I think its over the top. Packed with flavors and aromas, but theres a limit for everything. I shared my bottle with friends, but drank half of it on my own, but that took me some two hours. Two fine hours, but still...The pour was black as the original sin, with a small, lasting tan head leaving nice lacings. The flavor was as expected full of the dark stuff with licorice, molasses, burnt malt, chocolate and coffee doing most of the job. Actually, the licorice and roasted malt is trying to overpower all the others, and they do a good job on that attempt. Theres molasses, some warming alcohol, licorice and lots of sugary dark flavors in the mouth, also here its lacking a bit on the hoppy bitterness I think. Still its the beer being closest to a perfect 10 on flavor of those Ive had so far. Its thick and chewy on the palate, one of the chewiest Ive had, and it has a long finish with all the flavors found initially, and finally, theres my longed-for hoppy flavors too. It sort of deserves the hype I think, yet I think it might be overrated. (080215)","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

DL pours thick and viscous but a little weak in the froth producing only a shortlived copper sheath at the end that quickly disappears. Aromas are heavy and dense like a foggy night with tons of roasted chocolate. Full, chunky, chewy, nectar with soft carbonation that just hits the mark. This is like drinking pudding. A huge malted chocolate bar in every serving. I mean, seriously man...PUDDING THICKNESS. I have the phone next to me incase I need 911 to revive me from choking. This is aboslutely drinkable. Its amazingly balanced despite its decadent, hedonistic disposition. I wouldnt say this beer is complex but its right in your face and demands to be heard. Theres a defined roasted coffee bean component along with some vanilla waffer. The pudding turns a bit acidic on the finish which is a good thing as it helps to tame this beast. The high abv is  well hidden. Overall: I will Trump this as the head is weak and wouldnt get a full 100 for that alone. As for this being the best. Not in my book. Its fractions away from Dark Horizon. Its just not a complex beer by flavor or aroma. Bottom line: its in my top ten IS list.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"

1016,"2008-02-27",4.6,"UPDATED: NOV 28, 2009 Wow thanks a lot there Alldaydrinker for sharing this amazing beer with me. Im glad we could sit down on your birthday and drink a nice snifter full of this 2006 bottle. When poured out it was blacker then the blackest black times infinity. The beer did have an initial nut brown head that was thick but it faded very quick and it left no laceing along the sides of the glass due to its thick viscus syrup like texture. Dont be fooled though it is still an amazing brew. I must have smelled this for a good 10 minutes before i took my first sip since it was so rich on the nose and the alcohol was evaporating in my nostrils I could have got drunk off the smell alone. It was full of rich mocha chocolate, roasted coffee, cherry and raspberry with some other hints of dark fruits. You could also pick up that minor hop bitterness over all the other complex flavors. When i took my first small sip my mouth was blasted with coffee to the max. I feel like i just ate fresh coffee grounds and chased it with the creamiest coffee ice cream. This is probably the most intense coffee beer I have ever had. The more you drink it the more you want to savor the rich flavors in your mouth. Personally enjoyed the coffee film that was left around my entire mouth. After each sip the film just got thicker and thicker. I could still taste the beer flavor long after I had finished it. Since it is extremely think almost like drinking rich chocolate mocha, Irish cream, and coffee sludge but with that taste of heaven in your mouth. It starts out smooth and nice then gets rough and extremely bitter with a finish that is creamy and refreshing, almost like your having sex. I cant say enough about this amazing imperial stout.  Just glad i got a chance to try it considering its limited distribution.","Bristol, Rhode Island, USA","emerica56"

retention. Nose is pungent, from opening of the bottle was very noticeable. Complex and depth of this aroma is outstanding. Initial breakdown of the aroma 

hits the nose with strong display of alcohol, liqourish, lactic and cherries. Vinous qualities. Moving in underlying layers mocha, cappuchino, macadamia nuts 

and dark malts. Deepest layer is resembling some characteristics of a rauch, with sweet bbq smoke that brings salvation to mouth. Initial mouthfeel oflots of 

microbubbles and slushing over the mouth with smooth velvety touch.  Moving into a delicate melt of chocolate, cherry, fermented fruit mash, black currants 

and coffee. Enhancing heavily into the mid palate is creamy coffee icecream and mocha-cappuchino. The finish retains the coffee cream but bitter hops takes 

control in the bargaining mix displaying a bitter lactic. Roasted characteristics sit the background aggravated and sensitive. The aftermath is of stickiness of 

the mouth and lips.

Wonderfully complex aroma, with plum and raisin in the forefront, along with coffee, molasses, and vanilla. Aroma reminds me of a tawny port. Dark fruit and very sweet malt flavors are nicely complimented by coffee, chocolate, apple, and some hops. Flavor is much sweeter than i expected based on the aroma (and sweeter than I remember from a previous bottle). Syrupy mouthfeel.

Thick pitch black pour with little light tannish brown head on the first pour.  Small spotted lacing - good appearance, thick and dark.  Rich, roasted malt and sweet alcohol aroma.  The alcohol in the nose is well balanced with the sweet malt smell.  I get no coffee, but a little vanilla and some molasses as well as it warms.  The flavor is quite sweet, not nearly as roasted as I had imagined.  It has that rich, decadent dessert sweetness.  It almost tastes like a rich dark chocolate, alcohol infused cake.  The mouthfeel is memorable - very thick, very syrup-like.  It is quite creamy and rich and dense on the palate, but is on that thin line of being just too much.  It actually feels weighty on the tongue.  No real carbonation but I dont miss it in this - it is fitting here.  Finish is nearly tart, it is so sweet.  Aftertaste has the sweetness as well as the residual alcohol taste - not really my favorite aspect of this beer.  Feels like slightly watered down molasses on the tongue.  Overall, very well made - but the hype leading up to trying this for the first time may have spoiled it a bit for me.  Obviously a good brew but not the best Imperial Stout I have had (in fact there are at least 4 or so that come to mind that I feel are much more amazing than this).  Aside from that, a great beer for my 500th rating.  Thanks again acertain!

1016,"2008-02-03",4.8,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2008 Superbowl Sunday 2008! GO PATS! I really wanted to pregame in style! 2007 bottle - Apperance- Perfect dark black color, i can only describe it as a dark lord black. Beutifull, very dark brown head. Oily, leaves a lining around the glass as you drink it or swirl it around. If i opened this bottle freshly new, i would rate the appear as a four, but for an aged beer, i expect it to look a little oily, the color looks amazing. Smells supurb, with molasses, a faint milk chocolate, and a very strong expresso scent. Tastes amazing! What every imperial stout should strive to be! I personally think it lives up to the hype. Roasty hersey chocolate sweetness, caramel favor that i may be mistaken, and is really vanilla?, not just roasted coffee, but heavily dark roasted expresso, and maybe a sweet syrup taste also. It also really tastes cask or oak conditioned, like an aged stout. I cant imagine how good the actual oak aged or cask Dark Lord tastes.  Incrediably smooth, very drinkable for a 13% alc beer. The % is totally hidden in this lush, rich, delicious flavor! The best texture i have ever experianced. This is truely the best beer i have ever enjoyed. Im afraid to drink the 06 or 05 bottles which i have traded for, thinking they might be on the verge of getting that soy taste. But this is amazing, i would not age it any longer!

Poured dark black into a snifter with ruby edges when held to the light, and with no head.  Mustered a slight dark tan film as it swirled in the glass, but no more than that.  
Smell is of char, roasty malt, figs, definite soy note but not in an unpleasant way, and big notes of tart cherry, sweet creamy chocolate and especially lots of molasses.  Some alcohol showed, but didnt hinder it, really.

Taste is dark and very rich.  Fudge like chewy chocolate, with light hints of soy sauce and the same highly sweet molasses flavor and tart cherries again.  Didnt get any notes of coffee whatsoever.

Very low carbonation and a rich mouth coating body.  Would actually prefer a touch more carbonation in this.   Overall, rich, and smooth and definitely a very creamy, robust flavor, but in the end it was cloyingly sweet, I found.  Definitely not one of my favorite Imperial Stouts, but not one Id ever turn down trying either.

Fresh  08 bottle is more slightly more hoppy, bitter, and carbonated but still incredibly rich and flavorful with lots of dark sticky malt.  Definitely my favorite Ive tried, and the 4.4 is indicated by this vintage fresh.

Fresh 09 bottle came across with lots of licorice and was very sweet and sugary.  Perhaps slightly thinner than I remember, but definitely sweet than the fresh 08 bottles were, which lowers my overal score for the beer...","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"
1016,"2008-01-31",4.4,"2007 Silver waxed edition. Much love to Phatz for hooking me up with this bottle from DLD.  Much like Chuck Norris, this beer is not afraid of the dark, the dark is afraid of it. Essence of blackness. Thin, foamy, brown head that doesnt stand much of a chance againt this black hole of a beer. Some serious legs on this beer. Rich, assertive aroma with lots of earthy sweetness. An almost bourbon like characteristic of vanilla and oak. Dark fruit, sherry like dryness with alcohol spice. At first, there is also a strong shot of roasted coffee, although its not as assertive as I thought it would be. The flavor starts off with warm and gooey chocolate sweetness and then explodes into boozy vanilla, figs, and brewed coffee. Finish is dry, with husky notes of freshly roasted coffee beans and a hint of hop bitterness. The body starts off fairly smooth, but seems to get chewier and bigger as time goes on. By the end, its almost like drinking a thick mug of hot chocolate. The alcohol is not shy at all, providing a warming glow throughout.

*SLAP*, the Dark Lord commands your attention. Not a beer to be taken lightly, as the big flavor and big booziness are nothing to trifle with. Nice, big and bold RIS flavors with sweet, roasty, and bitterness throughout. Is it worth the hype? Thats up to you...","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","jasonm"
1016,"2008-01-27",4.5,"Approximately 6 oz. sample from 750mL bottle consumed at tennisjoels tasting on 1-26-08. 2007 vintage. This was the seventh of ten beers that we tried. Thanks to Joel for generously sharing this great beer and to ElGaucho for generously offering this beer to Joel. Complex, fruity aroma features plum, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, rum, port, and raisin scents. Pours a syrupy, very dark brown with some bubbling and some chunks of particulate. Looks like rich, dark chocolate. Slowly developing sable head. The flavors are so complex as to be difficult to describe. They include coffee, port, sautéed chocolate, lemon, cream, plum, and banana. There is some hops bitterness, but most of the bitterness seems to derive from the roasted malts. Delicious! Full body; this has to be the thickest beer Ive ever sipped. Oily but lively on the sides of the tongue. Silky smooth, creamy, and syrupy in the palate. The texture is awesome and may be the best Ive ever experienced in a beer. If I could give it a 6 for palate, I would. Dark Lord lives up to the hype! If Three Floyds toned down the coffee and turned up the hops, I bet this would be the best beer Ive ever had. As it is, it comes in a notch below Surly Darkness among the best imperial stouts I have yet to try but head and shoulders above everything else. It was easily, and not surprisingly, the best of the night. I should point out that the casual beer drinkers who came to the tasting did not particularly like this beer, but who cares? I loved it!

1016,"2008-01-12",4.7,"Bottle, grey wax seal from 2007.  Opened 20 Dec 2007 as an early birfday present to myself.  Aroma is pretty colossal, thick rich chocolate with alcohol and a bit of salt, roast coffee beans and a syrupy malt.  Lesser notes of vanilla and molasses, and Id swear I smelled bourbon if I didnt know better.  Noisy pour, soul-devouring blackness with a dark brown head that quickly fizzed into nothingness.  Enormously rich and full taste, strong with roast but even that is overcome by the hearty, dry fruit (though theres a slight, and unfortunate, metallic tendency before the palate numbs).  A really delicious berry flavor is dominant, with lighter vanilla and adjunct cream.  Plums and a thicker strain of port, with heavy, viscous molasses.  Chocolate cake with raisins and faint cherry topping.  Light flittering sweetness and sourness, but these two register more as afterthoughts.  Alcohol is much better integrated than was expected, mostly noticed in the heft and with little trace in the taste; even the residual warming is slight and almost snuck up on me.  Obese body, slightly syrupy but not to its detriment.  Startlingly, theres a touch of hops to be detected, lightly prickling in the finish and dry aftertaste, ultimately put to better effect than in Black Sun, which I adore.  Sticky lips for minutes of licking.  There seems to be wisdom in a best ingredients possible philosophy; its evident that high-quality beans were used, the kind Id like to buy by the pound and use every morning.  More importantly, as a front-running imperial stout, DL avoids the trap and does not seem to be sunk in any trudging mire or slogging bog or plodding fen; rather, its bright and glittering, spirited and vibrant and exciting.  Theres also a high degree of consumer satisfaction here; its as clearly opulent and well-heeled as we hope to find in gourmet food, to say nothing of highly-rated gourmet food.  Ive entered into this affair rather cautiously, but in the end, I feel Ive not been sufficiently effusive in my praise.  Superlative.P.S. Leaves an undesirably thick yeasty  residue on the glass.

While the alcohol lever is high (15%), it is never hot.  The flavors from the nose fill the palate and cover every nook and cranny.

1016,"2008-01-07",4.7,"This beer poured dark as night and very thick and oily. As it went into the pint glasses that we took out, it seemed to be visibly slow coming out of the wax-topped bottle. A cola color head that rose and fell quickly gave off roasty aromas and hints of dark chocolate and oak. The first sips were quite surprising. For a 12%ABV stout that had such a roasty, woody aroma, I would never have expected the decadent smoothness that was exhibited in this beer. Also surprising was that the chocolate notes came through stronger on the palate than the bitterness, which was subtly present and nicely balanced.  There was also a strong coffee note that was complex in that it provided the bitterness while also adding to the creaminess with a cafe au lait-type note. The mouthfeel was heaven. As it warmed up, it certainly got better all the way up to nearly room temperature (in a room with 20+ people and a fire going in the fireplace!). Absent was any hop profile or astringency from the roasted malts. This was a purely balanced, delicious beer that had a much softer edge than its reputation would have you believe. It was truly an excellent experience and it was on made all the more special, sharing it with an old friend.  Good to see you, Jason!","Bloomfield, New Jersey, USA","dogfishho"

Pours dark black with minimal tan head.  Aroma of chocolate, coffee and..peanuts?  Taste is wonderful, with all three of these elements meshing well together.  Palate is super smooth and silky.

1016,"2007-12-27",4.9,"HUGE thanks to moejuck for this epic brewski!!! 2007. Pours out a visibly viscous black that stains the glass with tiny particulates. It is so impenetrable that I can see a perfect reflection of my face on the surface of the beer. Light couldnt pass through a single drop of this stuff. The head is mocha-coloured and is short-lived. Brutal nose that assaults the senses with bountiful roasted coffee, dark chocolate, star anise, mild dry pitted fruit, wood and hickory-smoked bacon. The viscosity and richness of the palate is unbelievable! Flavours of rich coffee, dark cherry, vanilla, molasses, port, baking cocoa, and hickory smoke and wood. Hints of herbal mint tea and sweet soy sauce in the flavour, but in no way do this take away from the overall flavour profile. The finish brings about a bitterness that either came from the roasted malt, or possibly whatever amount of hops they used, Im really not sure. Theres definitely a brighter, more citric flavour in the finish that accompanies the smoke and applewood bacon. This brings new meaning to full-bodied and this monster drinks like syrup, drying the palate and caking the lips and gums like no other. Palate duration...come on! I could taste this the next morning. The hype is real. This is truly incredible.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Drink4Satan"
1016,"2007-12-27",4.8,"Great thanks to Drink4Satan for sharing this with me. 2007, Silver Wax. Pours syrupy BLACK! Tiny little dark brown head but that dissipates extremely fast. Aromas of Star Anise, smoked malts (Oh my god, so much smokiness), almost Rauchbeer like. Hickory smoked bacon and espresso. This is an Imperial Stout. I was pretty excited to tear this apart but I dont think it is possible! Dark Chocolate, a ton of molasses, dark cherries, vanilla extract, soy sauce, and so much roasted coffee beans. Coffee and hop bitterness. This leaves a dirty film all the way down the glass, as if I left this glass sitting for a couple days! Mouth feel is syrupy and chewy. As a matter of fact, I finished this a few minutes ago and I still have the full taste left over. Lingering woody notes and sweet cherries are quite pleasant; with a coffee bitterness that nearly overpowers all else. This stuff was the description of opaque. A single drop absorbs the light but does not let it pass through. Very impressive and I may have ruined my taste buds. It will not be easy to top this brew, My hat is off to Three Floyds.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","TopherDrinks"

with dark Scharffen Berger chocolate notes as well. Since today is Christmas Day, this beer is my present to myself. Flavors are of dark chocolate, macerated cherries, Bourbon barrels, vanilla beans, maple syrup, burnt sugars, toffee, espresso. You name it, its in there. The flavors are all over the place. Chewy mouth feel, rich & thick, like chocolate covered raisin bars. Immense roasted flavors compete with the chocolate notes. Some berry notes, like Starbucks Arabian Mocha Sanani
coffee. Port wine notes in the flavors also. Damn tasty beer. Im glad I traded a Thomas Hardy Ale (1980 vintage) for this rascal of a beer. Best RIS Ive had in a long, long time. 2 thumbs up to Three Floyds for making this monster of a beer. Merry Christmas!","","Cobra"

1016,"2007-12-20",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2007 Vintage 2007, thanks to Stevo.  Sludgy black pour of used motor oil rimmed with a bit of metallic tan skin, leaving a grainy film coating the sides of the glass as it goes down.  Rich, smoky aroma of applewood bacon and lots of wet vegetal hops.  Spicy African coffee beans of the most massive variety and hints of whiskey heat fill in underneath while fresh green apple and kiwi lend a bit of surprisingly pleasant tang over the top.  Softer flavors of whiskey soaked figs and peaches lend a bit of well-intentioned subtlety and grace to the brutal juggernaut of wet german chocolate cake, wildly earthy roast, and foamy latte; the bits of quiet fruit sugars soften the aggressive edge, but the general tone remains quite jagged and imposing.  Cooling sensations of vanilla and mint chase the back end of that dessert type of sweetness before the salty, dark burst of soy sauce licks the palate with delayed but firm force.  Beneath these brutish impressions theres a lot of depth to the flavor that struggles to find expression, though it digs deep enough, given a little time, into blueberries, black licorice, grainy honey, and barbecue wood; the reservoir is virtually bottomless and the presentation carefully balanced.  In the mouth, the velvet syrup of a heavy fudge milkshake makes this something between solid and liquid form.  Bold and viscous, but still calm and creamy, and quite unique in its complete command of the palate; almost requires chewing.  The sticky, syrupy coating of maple syrup and ground espresso swells with a green and citrusy kind of hoppy flourish, vaguely unpleasant and unwarranted.  A frontal attack to every sense, without reservation and without much tact; complex, foreboding, and surprisingly ambiguous in its final, staggering impression.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
1016,"2007-12-19",4.5,"Rating #500. Bottle courtesy of sprinkle. Pours black as crude oil with a creamy, rusty-brown head that settles first to a thin ring around the glass and then to a slick oily black surface. Swirling the glass leaves temporary iodine-like stains of reddish-yellow hue sliding down the sides. Visibly viscous, Ive never seen a beer coat a glass quite like this one. After finishing the snifter-full, the glass is coated in a sticky residue as if it had been frosted or lightly acid etched. Interesting. The nose is of huge, roasted, dark malt, light ash and vanilla, licorice, plum and a tiny hint of a soy sauce, concluding with enough alcohol that I was getting a contact buzz just from drawing off of the snifter. Calling this beer ""full-bodied"" is a complete understatement. Thick and oily with a roasted and lightly bitter finish that includes a nice ""warm"" alcohol note, the palate features a lingering roasted and moderately hoppy aftertaste that acts as a nice counterpoint to the significant sweetness of the tons of malt that must be used to create this wonderful concoction. Big, sweet, dark roasted malt, plum, brown sugar and a light peaty note all combine to create a delicious brew that concludes with a nice, lingering, roasty/hoppy finish. This is a very good beer and quite deserving of its reputation. Now, Ill just have to snag another bottle to cellar for a while... damn it.

1016,"2007-12-16",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2009 #1,000 - Im pretty excited about this one - 2007 bottle from footbalm (thanks to an excellent trader!!!).  First of all, let me state my feeling of regret at having grown up maybe an hour or so from FFF and never made it to the brewery, let alone to DL day (they were closed on my most recent trip).  They do some special stuff and I have really enjoyed all the beers Ive tried from them - that being said, on with the rating.  Dark, blackish color with a light-med tan head and a beautiful hazy look.  Aroma has a very special mix of dark, dark chocolate, coffee, heavy roast, assorted sweet flavors - molasses, maple, and fudge, and just a bit of alcohol.  Taste is a thick blend of espresso, strong African or East Asian coffees, dark, creamy chocolate, a bit of hop flavor, and various sweet flavors that are pretty amazing.  Mouthfeel is so thick and delicious.  A really wonderful beer that, at least as far as Impy stouts go, stacks up with the best of em - it matches Expedition and almost gets to Speedway and is incredibly enjoyable.  I cant wait for the year when I can do Dark Lord day, but until then Ill just have to be happy with the memories of this bottle.  Wonderful stuff.","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"
1016,"2007-12-04",4.1,"Silver wax 2007 version. Poured into a Dogfish Head snifter on 11/16/07 to celebrate the GF visiting!

Motor oil. Thats what it looks like. Used motor oil. It is thick and viscous and there is no head or bubbles whatsoever. A lot of strong RISs tend to look like this.

This smells a lot older than it is. I would believe that this had been aged for 10 years if you told me so. It also has a ton of maple syrup right up front. Behind that there is come chocolate and brown sugar. Its a great aroma but doesnt make me think of an RIS, more of an Old Ale. The alcohol is obvious.

Not what I was expecting at all. There is a bunch of flavor in there but it doesnt make me think of an RIS, just like the aroma. There is dark chocolate, some cherry, and a bunch of wood. It ends bitter with a bunch of alcohol.

Thinner than I expected. I like thick stouts but this isnt one of them. It is still heavy bodied, but I want it thicker.

Ill be honest...this was a bit of a let down. Its a great beer, but not worth the immense hype. The body wont increase with time, but the alcohol presence might be reduced and that would improve the taste.","Troy, New York, USA","drseamus"

Pours the darkest, thickest, most gruesome, disgusting, tar black Ive ever seen from a consumable liquid. From the black abyss comes bubbling up a huge and intimidating looking muddy brown head. Aroma is very deep and roasty with your nose being invaded by toasted nuts, a slight sweetness of dark fruits and molasses, and yes my friends rich coffee. Taste is rich yet again with dark chocolate and coffee mixing together with a slight sweetness of dark cherries and again more molasses. Alcohol is present but not hardly an issue with everything else going on! The keystone of this beer is the god like texture and thickness of this brew.

1016,"2007-09-27",4.7,"200th Rating: Poured from a 2007 vintage 22oz bomber and served in a snifter.  This brew poured a totally opaque black with a very slight dark tan head that quickly disappeared.  Some very sticky, thick, oily legs coated the entire inside of the glass.  The aroma of the beer was made up of french roast coffee, dark chocolate, molasses, dark fruits, and also some burnt malt notes.  The flavor included strong coffee and chocolate notes, dark cherries and plums, molasses, some lightly smokey burnt malts, and just a hint of vanilla.  Just an amazing taste to experience!  The mouthfeel was ultra thick and chewy.  Definately full-bodied with almost no noticable carbonation.  An outstanding beer that is truly worthy of the high praise.  Excellent!!!","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"

Looks like motor oil with 150K miles on it. The aroma hits sweet with molasses mixed with burnt malts. The thick rich mouth feel makes you go, Mmmmm Yum. Malt sweetness yields to both fruitiness and burnt malts. Also getting in the flavor line are caramelized malts, hints of coffee, dark chocolate, faint toffee and more coffee as the finish approaches. A thick oil slick coats the mouth and punctuates the after taste with rich roasted to burnt malts, coffee and malt sweetness. Darn good brew.Rating #800","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

1016,"2007-08-31",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2010 2007 vintage, courtesy boboski.  Massively thick, dirty motor oil pour.  Virtually black body that does show traces of the darkest mahogany at the top edge.  A small layer of dense, light brown foam crowns the utterly dense liquid below.  The aroma is awesome, showing big time notes of chocolate of every variety.  Licorice, coffee, stewed raisins, and dark rum infiltrate the nose in massive waves.  The flavor is equally huge and impressive.  Various dark fruits emerge from the chocolaty, coffee liquor depths.  Vanilla and hazelnuts add beautiful highlights.  Ample resinous hops perform the difficult task of balancing this monster out, and they do it well.  The mouthfeel is as thick as any Ive ever encountered.  Viscous and smooth body.  The finish is long and pleasant.  Just an excellent, over-the-top brew.2008 vintage.  Very similar to 2007.  Dense and impossibly thick.  Loads of rich chocolate and dark fruit.  I tried this one a little younger than the 07, and there was significantly more earthen bitterness to note.  Still an excellent brew.2009 vintage.  Whoa......where did things go wrong?  This batch is just not very good.  Massively syrupy and cloying, with little fruit depth and loads of booze.2010 vintage, courtesy JMFG.  Well, Im gonna go ahead and say that theyve turned a pretty damn impressive beer into something of a Frankenstein in the matter of just a few short years.  Compared to the masterful 2007 vintage, this stuff somehow seems thinner, hotter, and far less complex.  Loads of chocolate syrup and caramel still show, but the earthy molasses and deep, dark fruit contingent seem amidst the extra alcohol.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

With a freshly opened bottle of 2007 Dark Lord, notes on past tastings, and trusty snifter in hand, I finally have decided to sit down and rate one of the Holy Grails of beer geeks everywhere.  Here it goes...

2007 vintage, drank 7/17/2007: Well, Nick suggested keeping this puppy cellared until Thanksgiving, but I couldnt keep my hands off it that long.  Hell, I made it 2.5 months, which is about 2.49 months longer than I thought I would. You can see the viscosity of this brew as you pour - it sticks to the sides of the glass and slowly runs down to form a thick black pool, impenetrable to light and topped with a thick brown head.  The aroma hits me long before I get the glass close to my nose - roasted coffee, molasses, licorice, and dark chocolate accompany the pine resin and a moderate earthiness.  The flavor is chock full of just about everything you would want in an imperial stout - this stuff is seriously complex.  Its tough to put into words, as everytime I take a sip, a new flavor emerges.  Coffee, roasted nuts, molasses, chocolate, and rum battle it out with a serious dose of piney hops.  Mouthfeel is silky smooth and very full, though it is a touch chalky, it may need some more time to settle out.  DLD continues to be a great time (Ive gone the past three years), cheers to the folks at Three Floyds for hosting the event!

2006 vintage: Like other vintages, this is opaque black with a firm brown head.  Aroma is green and grassy, even after a year in the cellar.  Green hops hit immediately upon tasting, with the coffee being notably more subdued than the 05 version.  For my tastes, the hops are too pronounced and do not integrate well with the rest of the flavors.  Thinner bodied than other years.  Still a very good IS, though. To be fair, I havent popped a bottle since it was relatively fresh, so it may have improved with age.(7/4/8/3/14 3.6)

2005 vintage (from several bottles over the past 2+ years): For a malt lover like myself, this one is just hitting its stride now.  The hops have mellowed a bit, and the strong coffee flavors have integrated very well.  Though, I must say I loved this one enough when it was fresh to go buy an extra case, and Im glad I did.  Similar flavor profile to the 2007, with the 05 having a bit more chocolate and vinous notes, while the 07 has stronger coffee and molasses.  (8/4/9/4/18 4.3)","Rochester, New York, USA","ElJefe"
1016,"2007-08-18",4.8,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2008 Silver wax, 2007 version (rated above)

Pours out a very thick black color, but dark shades of red around the edges. Head is a creamy tan color, but did recede and leaves little to no lacing. Smell is of sweet caramel and molasses, cherry, alcohol, chocolate, and a little roastiness. Sweet malt and molasses, with a splash of hops, though they are fading, followed by port wine with a lingering soft roastiness. Vanilla seems to also join in the cornucopia of flavors, as well as others Im sure Im not able to name. Carbonation is very much on the low side; body is as thick as they come. Id like to say its overhyped, but its just really everything I look for in an Imperial Stout. I had one bottle shortly after the release and it was pretty good, but age has already helped raise this one to elite status.

2004 (sampled at DLD 2008):
Aroma is still amazing, flavor is good, but starting to get too oxidized.  More detailed notes to come.

2005 (sampled at DLD 2008):
This vintage is holding up awesome, if you have one left, it might be time to give it a crack, although it seems it still has some time left to develop.  More detailed notes to come.

2006:  Updated rating to come

2008:  Incredible fresh out of the gate, could be the best vintage to date.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"
1016,"2007-08-11",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 21, 2008 Draft at the Great Taste of the Midwest. Here we go! Unlike the Dreadnaught, this one lives up to the hype and somehow surpasses it. The aroma is the only flaw: big sweet, rich and boozy. Could be a little richer. Pours jet black with deep rich red highlights. Sweet, roasted malt, toffee, dark (and milk) chocolate, wood, whiskey, vanilla, raisins, plums, and hops on the palate.  I honestly dont know if I could stand any more flavor. Quite full bodied. Very rich with a mouth coating oiliness. Absolutely spectacular!

Re-rate. After multiple 07 bottles, one 08 bottle and a draft sample at the GTMW this year, I feel I have to give this one a re-rate.My tastes have definitely changed a ton over the last year and a half, and although I still like it quite a bit, its no longer what I look for in a beer.   I thought the 08 was a lot more bitter and astringent with a much higher coffee presence than previous vintages.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"

The alcohol kinda sneaks up on you toward the finish of the beer.  This was a real delight.  Nice to know I have another.  Thanks Steve and Matt.","BFE, Arizona, USA","cbkschubert"
1016,"2007-07-23",4.5,"1000th rating!. Bottle. Big thanks to TomDecapolis for grabbing me a bottle when he went out for DL day and thanks to FooFaa for bringing it all the way back from Indiana to Pennslyvania..

Pours a deep, deep midnight black body with thin head. The body was so deep and black that is showed my reflection as I looked down into the snifter. A beautiful black body. The aroma had a nice roasted coffee, chocolate smell. Pleasntly placed hops abound in my nose during a few sniffs throughout the drinking experience.

Now onto the taste. Nice full bodied roasted coffee, chocolate, cocoa, dusty malt, plums. I seemed to get a few different combinations of all the above during every sip I took. The mouthfeel was spot on perfect. Nice sticky aftertaste. My lips were clinging to the snifter.My tastebuds were screaming that there was more than 220z to quench my thirst.

Big thanks to everyone on the site that made 1000 ratings possible, especially the guys I traded with who have always found some great and rare beers to send. Big thanks to the Philly Hop Crew who have provided me with some great samples within the past year. Thanks guys! Heres to 1000 more! Cheers!","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","jason"

1016,"2007-07-21",4.9,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2007 Draft.  I went to the Indiana brewers guild festival with hopes that after that day I may have a new favorite.  But when it came to the dark lord I figured that it was just really extreme and strong.  I couldnt have been more wrong.  Here is a beer worth the wait.  It is smooth as silk, it has complexity without forcing the issue, masks alchohol super well, tastes great.  Super Human culinary achievement.  Extraordinary texture!  Less intense but more enjoyable than Stone RIS.

Dark impenetrable with a thick creamy smooth tan head.  Slowly disappears, which I guess is what you get when even a huge impy stout is kegged up.  A rather faint nose, kind of a downer.  Alclohol laced coffee/chocolate liquor sort of notes.  Very subdued and not bang your head in roasty.  Absolutely flawlessly velvetty smooth.  Low carbonation, and delightful mouth warming going on in here.  Right after the Bells Bourbon Barrel Double Cream/Exped., this is still phenomenal.  Smooth creamy chocolatey alcohol.  Sweet syrupy malt.  More alcohol roasty coffee and sweetness than chocolate, but its still definitely huge.  This beer is huge man.  A lingerign sweet, yet somehow bitter enough not to be cloying, finish with alcohol.  Very nice.  Id argue its worth the hype, and I hate hype..

I saved it for my 300th rating. The pour was thick and dark. Like pouring chocolate syrup! No head what so ever for me. The smell...GOOD GOD...It smelled like a Hersheys dark chocolate bar...I could have just sat around sticking my nose in it all night, but, well, that wouldnt have been nearly as fun as drinking it. THE TASTE: Yum. And WOW...Taste was soooo smooth. Not at all what I was expecting out of this monster. Sweet chocolate. Cherries. Coffee. Some figs, or prunes, maybe, followed by a giant alcohol kick. I swear I taste some sort of bourbon as well...This beer got tons better as it warmed...Or perhaps it was because I got warmer. I am not sure, but this was an absolutely delightful experience. I dont know that I would go stand in line for it for three hours like some of you, but I would certainly drink it any time!

2007 Bottle courtesy of NachalmSie shared with Muenster, myself, and a couple other individuals. The pour is an intensely opaque and viscous ebony. It was as if darkness had a liquid form. We tried to find traces of light passing through it, but was unsuccessful. Even the edges of the glass where the liquid was most shallow against the light seemed not to let the light pass through. On my pour, there seemed to be a non-existent head. However, a few of the others glasses had some decent head to theirs. The head was a somewhat velvety dark tan that lasted quite some time and had some beautiful lacing. The aroma was intense in malt, cocoa, espresso, and hops with hints of vanilla,  molasses, and a some smokiness. As it hit the tongue, your taste buds get overloaded with flavoursintense flavours of cocoa, toffee, a smoky and earthy espresso, molasses, vanilla, and hints of a darker fruit. As the temperature raised, the more robust flavours, such as the espresso, seemed to burst. At 13%, theyve masked the alcohol quite well. The experience I had drinking this beer has been seared into my memory. Even as I write this, a couple months after my initial tasting, I remember the experience as if it were no more than a couple hours ago. I dont think I even needed the notes I wrote at that time.

2007 Draught. Oh man, this is better than I remember it being. The vinous notes seem to be a little more evident than I remember, but the coffee, molasses, toffee, and cocoa flavours are a still little more dominant here.

2008 Bottle shared by a random individual at Dark Lord Day that seemed to be grateful that I had a bottle opener. (Thank you, random person)
Just like 2007, 2008 pours just as viscous. The nose is way, way more vinous than last years. Cherry is a strong aroma here, followed by other dark citric aromas, then coffee, toffee, vanilla, and molasses. The flavour is also much, much more vinous. Cherries seem to be the flavour of dominance this year. I cant say I like this as much as Dark Lord 2007, so far. Ive yet to put some age into this. But its still mind-blowingly tasty.

2007/2008 comparitive tasting. Bottles shared with NachlamSie and muenster. Thanks NachlamSie for sharing another 2007.
 Pour: The 07 seems to be a bit more viscous than the 08. The head in the 07 is also silkier. 08s head wasnt really that impressive as I was expecting. The bubbles were relatively big, and not nearly as fine as the 07. The head seems to completely diminish in the 07 after it sits for a little while. Afterwards, its somewhat impossible to swirl it enough to get the head back. The 08s head doesnt completely diminish but leaves enough around the edges so that after a vigorous swirl, youre still able to resurrect the head.
Aroma: 07 seems to have a more well rounded aroma and some more noticeable alcohol. Its also slightly more smoky. The aroma in the 08 seems to have citrus leaning more towards raisins while the 07 would be plums. Both also have prune qualities.
Mouthfeel:The 08 is noticeably less viscous than the 07.
Flavour: 08 is slightly smokier than the 07 and bit more bitter. The 07 is, however, more well rounded. 08 has more citrus notes than the 07. Cherries also appear in the 08, which I dont find in the 07. As both of these sit, its actually becoming harder to figure which I like better. At pour, 07 actually tasted better than after its been sitting. After about 20 minutes, it has degraded in flavour, and I think a lot of this also has to do with the lack of head. I noticed with head, the 07 excelled. But when the head becomes nonexistent, the 08 seems to excel. Man, this is tough, but I actually think that I like the 08 more than the 07 now that its aged for a few months. I would have to up my rating for DL2008 up to 4.5, matching 07.

2008 Bottle. Yeah, Ive rated this year two times already. Though, this is the first where I get to sit down and focus on the experience as I rate. It pours extremely viscous with a thin, quickly diminishing dark tan film on the surface as its head. Its so black that held up to the light only the very most thinning edges allows the light to pass through. The beer sticks to the glass as its swirled, like teriyaki sauce. The aroma assaults the sinuses with very dry pungency. The two dominant aroms are berries, primarily cherries, and coffee. Its also strangely effervescent. Vanilla is noticeable as well as a hint of alcohol. The brew doesnt have much initial flavour, which doesnt change at all as it sits on the tongue. Alcohol is whats primarily noticeable. But as it passes the tongue the taste buds are assaulted with an intense amount of flavour. Coffee and cocoa explodes with very noticeable hints of cherries. Molasses gives some sweetness as vanilla adds a nice touch. Bitterness soon strikes and continues to escalate, emphasizing the hops presence and complementing the coffee and cocoa. And boy, this has a lot of hops. The finish is very abrasive and dry. Bitterness peaks, attacking the back of the tongue. Coffee and Cocoa diminish very slowly. Cherry flavour remains consistent and eventually starts to slightly outshine the coffee. Alcohol becomes more apparent as it warms the chest. This is a phenomenal beer. Its so flavourful and robust that its actually a chore to drink the entire bottle. Your taste buds go on an overload half-way through the bomber.

1016,"2007-07-19",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 23, 2012 Complete re-rate for the first time I drank a full bottle by myself
In short: A big (very big) complex stout.  Excellent.
How: Bottle 22oz.  2008 release.  Bought at the brewery, consumed 8 months after release.
The look: Black body topped by a tan ring of foam
In long: Unfocussed nose (in a good way) with roastiness, dark fruits, black chocolate, tar, coffee everything.  The body is quite something.  I could almost consume the beer with a knife and a fork yet the body doesnt feel too heavy or syrupy.  The beer is certainly very sweet but only feels moderately sweet.  In mouth the beer doesnt feel that roasted.  What I got was a complex mix of chocolate, fresh dark fruits, molasses, black coffee, red fruits (!), liquorice, and more.  An overall chocolate ice-cream sensation.  Alcohol is excessively well hidden.  What appears to be fruity citrusy hops (hard to make out in a such a big beer) lighten out the beer a lot.  Ive had it in tastings many times and shared many bottles with friends but I was hesitant to drink a full bottle.  I wrongfully thought that this beer was only drinkable in small samples and my rating would plummet if I drank a bottle by myself.  Wrong.  This may not be the hyped masterpiece that ratebeer makes it to be but this is really one of the best Imperial Stout Ive ever had.  I will only revisit this rating if I have a full bottle by myself of a 2009 or later so the odds of me revisiting this rating is about the same as the odds of me re-visiting my annoying cousin Louis.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

1016,"2007-07-09",4.6,"2007 bottle purchased by my brother at Dark Lord Day, and shared with him and my nephew on 7/5/07. Im a skeptic by nature, and with all the hype that srrounds this beer, I was ready for a very critical look. I have to say that the hype is justified. This is a huge beer.

To say this is opaque black does not really describe it, as it even looks thick as it pours, and produces a big brown head, although the lace was a little slippery. Aroma is loaded for bear with coffee, prunes, chocolate, licorice, vanilla, some spice, and olord knows what else. Full, thick, palate coating with a lasting chewiness that has to be esperienced to really appreciate. Treacle, burnt caramel, and a certain earthiness dominate the flavor, but somewhere in there dwell enough hops dry this monster out.

1016,"2007-07-07",4.4,"2007 bottle: Pours pitch black like motor oil. Not much head, dark dark brown bubbles. Aroma is super coffee and malty. The first thing i notice when sipping is the thickness of the body. Syrupy and slightly sweet but really pretty dry. You get some sharp citrusy like fruit flavors to begin with. A friend described it as blood orange. But then its all malt and coffee after the initial taste, i can pick out the coffee and the vanilla although both are used delicately. Very complex flavors. It coats your mouth. But i think the thing that makes this beer stand out over say speedway is the finish. At the end i really get the coffee and somewhat graininess but it finishes dry without barely any lingering flavors. Super clean for the style. Its not like speedway where it covers your mouth and kills your taste buds long after your last drink. Probably the best Imperial Stout i have had.","portland, Oregon, USA","SamuraiArtist"

 While blackcats and m-80s burst all around me (Fourth of July) and the city of Chicago explodes in a fit of unbridled delinquency, sparks drift down upon us from the upstairs neighbors bottle rockets.  A new noise drowns out all of them, a sort of angelic/satanic singing of *ahh uhh ahh* as the words ""do you want me to crack open my 07 darklord?"" come from that john guy from the hampton inn.  I pause, ""really? really?!?!?!"" ""Sure"" he says as he pulls the bottle out of the fridge.  I pace around, making him nervous and just as antsy, this will be only my 3rd time trying this beer, as I have put away my 6 alotted, taking them to Michigan, lest I become impatient and open all of them in brazen ecstasy.  I nice *sisssss* breaks out of of the silver wax and I watch as the motor oil thick brew is poored into 7 wine glasses to be shared amonst friends.  
My inner Golem almost comes out as my precious is shared with the unrefined few, little do they know what this beer will do and who it has turned.  I take my glass and swirl the serious black, viscous brew.  A small burnt brown emerges, a color of head never seen before or since in any brew.  It is baeutiful, it is art.  I allow my self a sniff, aromas abound, bourbon of the south, choclate of the inca, sweet, dark burned malt like the never ending hellfires, it is the perfume of love and rage.  I dare not sip this brew of ecstasy for every sip, even the first, is one step closer to it being finished.  I finally dare to break the seal and pearce my lips to the glass.  I small tablespoon sized sip, just to get me started, I am overwhelmed by oak, vanilla, bourbon, choclate, molasses and charred wood.  The body is as thick as it looks and the alc burns so good.  I give over to the dark lord, he knows me like no other.  I love this beer and sit and savor it and wait to see if the others tender pallets cant handle its sadist attacks and pawn off their beers on me.  None do.  I will remember this dark lord experience like I remember the others: as rights of passage, and unbrazen joy.","Grand Rapids/Chicago, Michigan, USA","xnoxhatex"
1016,"2007-07-05",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 12, 2008 Bottle 07 vintage. Pours black. Seriously black. The head is even, firm, and a shade of brown. I can smell this stuff even while pouring a couple feet away from nose. Its aromatic indeed, though not as much as its barrel-aged counterpart. A closer sniff reveals heavy dried fruits, plums, molasses, chocolate, earth, some roasted coffee, but not as much as Id expect; rum, toasted pumpernickel, and chocolate covered banana. Wow, this stuff is thick. Its like syrup in the mouth, I almost want to chew. More roasted notes are apparent in the flavor. Its sweet, not overly so, but rich in flavors similar to cherries, molasses, chocolate. . .The finish is great, it reminds me of those little vanilla pastries from France. I get a bit more raisins and rum now, some wood and soil notes too. This is such a rich, thick beer. wait, is that some smoky, dark roasted coffee in the finish?  I better sip on this for a while longer before I log all my thoughts. Okay, heres a thought: This stuff is so thick and syrupy its ridiculous. The more this warms up, the more I like it. I have to say I was only very impressed on the first few sips, but at warmer temps my mind is being blown away. What a tremendous beer! 

[June 12, 2008]

Bottle of the 2007 batch split with the dudes. Pours black as tar and just as viscous. The aroma is amazing. I thought that perhaps in my beer tasting growth this would no longer live up to its hype, but it does. Im thinking Ten Fidy and Mephistopheles mixed together. The sweeter notes are here: rum, molasses, vanilla wafers, but also roasty espresso and hickory. Deep fruit hints are noted. The mouthfeel is oil. Rich, though appropriate, sweetness hits my palate with more hints of vanilla, molasses. A dry bittersweetness keeps things balanced and the alcohol is not detectable whatsoever. Layers of flavors wash over my tongue which all seem to culminate in one intense experience. This is the imperial stout, not leaps and bounds above the best, but certainly a leg up on even my favorites in the style. 


Bottle of the 2008 thanks to BossHossBikes

Wow, this pours black. Its even a shade darker than the 2007, only noticeable in the color of the head. Fruitier scents are indicated on this one. Cherries, Dr. Pepper, and definite rum hints again, though less intense than 2007. The palate is viscous again, just pure oil. A more earthy foundation is present, which I like, but again more emphasis on brighter fruits. Licorice, brownies, mocha, no much roast going on here. The 2008 vintage really reminds me of 2007 Mephistopheles, just with less alcohol presence. Actually, the alcohol is completely hidden. My score reflects the mighty 2007 vintage.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

However, the excessiveness seems to hide many real beer traits.  This is sludge with many interesting flavors, but far from something I could enjoy very often at all.

1016,"2007-06-03",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2009 Fantastic beer. 
2007, consumed fresh
Very well rounded in deep berry and chocolate/coffee malt flavors.  A slight touch of alcohol both on the nose and in the beer, but not in a bad way whatsoever.  Very oily and full of sediment, this beer finishes bitter, but sweet.  Very complex.  Very much worth the hype.

Aroma is lots of oily, higher alcohols, and dull piny, smooth chocolate, creamy/nutty/milky, touches of heat and red fruit. (wow, what a mess of description)
Taste is slightly hoppy bitter, mostly red fruit, sweet, and creamy dense.
Finish is cloying, sweet, and long lasting.

1016,"2007-05-30",4.6,"UPDATED: NOV 6, 2011 Bottle of 07.  Finally - the Holy Grail of American Beers.  Complex aroma - detected coffee, molasses, cinnamon, dark chocolate, prune, port wine - seemed to be ever changing.  Pours like oil - dark black-brown with just a film of head.  Creamy sweet dark chocolate and prune flavor initially then a cinnamon/molasses/malt flavor finishing with a port and lingering hops finish.  Becomes more vinous as it warms.  A work of art.
(09) - Prune, butterscotch, coffee anise aroma.  Motor oil black.  Sweet-tart cherry, prune, cocoa/mocha malt flavor.  Seemed less spicy/vinous than in 07 but still phenomenal.  Nov 2011 - 2009 - Doing well - pretty sweet but solid.  2010 - Less sweet than the 2009 but also less complex - chocolate and cola aroma.  Less fruit flavors than the past versions but my favorite between the 09, 10, 11.  2011- Extremely sweet and strong vegetal aroma and flavor - going to let this one set for a while before trying again.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
1016,"2007-05-29",3.6,"Probably the darkest, thickest pour Ive ever seen. Aroma suckerpunches you....Big vanilla, coffee, figs, malt and sugar on the nose. Very, very rich. Big molasses and coffee taste. Lots of roasty malts, bitterness, burnt cherries and other fruit in there as well. Vanilla is very light here. Extremely smooth mouthfeel, but the overbearing sweet and bitter flavors seem to overshadow this. Lots of clashing aspects. This beer is HUGE. Lots of warming alcohol throughout. When compared with other FFF brews and other imperial stouts, this just doesnt seem to match up. Dont get me wrong: Its big, bold, complex and tasty....just not the epiphony that many make it out to be. If anything, its just TOO big. A mammoth Impy that is deserving of its reputation, just not as enjoyable/drinkable as other Impys out there.","Blowing Rock, North Carolina, USA","BleacherBum"

I tasted lots of raisins, vanillia, cherries, plums, chocolate, molasses, smoke, and just a bit of coffee, etc etc etc... it then continued to linger on the palate for minutes.  Very very nice mouthfeel indeed.  But here we are, middle way through the bottle - and it starts to become heavily unenjoyable.  Insanely sweet and soy sauce like, what happened?

Pitch black and still with some beige swirls. Aroma of espresso, roasted malt and sweet raisin. This vintage was much more impressive in flavor. Tons of molasses and cherry with smoke, all smothered in loads of dark chocolate and vanilla. Palate was silky smooth, coating the back of the tongue and giving a warm alcohol feeling in the back of the throat. The chocolate and coffee flavors linger forever.

It needs to be enjoyed not picked apart and the enjoyment of it be gone. This beer poured in the darkest shade of black with the darkest of tan heads out there. The aroma I believe was very subtle  far from the explosion you get that first sip so many flavors in this you can not explain a few that stuck out were cherries, coffee, molasses and choclate.

Impressively dark pour with a red-brown foam, but it didnt stain my notes as dark I thought it would when  swirled my glass too vigorously.  Aroma of chocolate syrup, molasses, rum, raisins, alcohol.  Wonderfully sweet flavor, lots of chocolate and syrup, but theres some roast and earthy flavors rounding it out.  Finish blends really well the rest of the beer, but I felt it should have offered something stronger to balance the flavor.  Some hops and butter were there, but otherwise its just the upfront flavor fading away.  Mouthfeel was very thick but it was a bit oily to me.  From what I read this was the weaker vintage, and I would love to try some fresh stuff, eventually.  Great sweet flavor, but overall, this lacked some key elements in the finish, and creaminess.

2008 bottle, all for ME!  Thanks to Crizay and his ladyfriend for this.  Pours black with a reddish brown foam, thick and creamy looking.  Looks great.  Aroma of dark roast, leafy plant-like hops, dark chocolate, espresso, rum, molasses becomes more fudge-like as it warms.  Flavor is very sweet, but it balances itself pretty well considering.  Definitely tons of dark chocolate, a slight milk chocolate and fudge flavor, rum, raisins, a slightly vinous flavor and port-like dark fruit, some coffee, and a slight bit of molasses.  Finishes strong with espresso, earthy hop flavor, bitter roast aftertaste.  Mmm, nice and Three Floyds-y.  Unbelievably thick and viscous mouthfeel, soft carbonation, very creamy.  Warming in the finish, but never really hot.  Getting sweeter as it warms.  I gotta say, Im a sucker for beers like this and I enjoy this more now that I can have it by itself.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

1016,"2007-05-09",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2011 Bomber from 2007. Pours black as the abyss with dense dark brown head, and a swirl leaves high legs on the side of the glass. The aroma is heavy on the molasses, along with lots of bakers chocolate, espresso, prune, citrus, and smoke. The flavor is espresso and citrus fruit at first. Then kick in the molasses, planty hops, and very faint smoke. There are also strong notes of earth, chocolate, raisin, and vanilla. The finish has both sweet and bitter elements, but leaves a lingering deep sweetness into the aftertaste. Its amazing that a beer with so many strong flavors can meld together so well. I poured in the sludge, and got an oatmeal-raisin cookie quality. It gets very vinous as it warms. Leaves slight alcohol burn deep in the throat. Incredibly viscous mouthfeel.

Turns out that half a glass was plenty for the 4 of us to share.  Its a beautiful looking beer, almost solid black.  Kind of like soy sauce and it smells like soy sauce too.  Tastes and feels like molasses.  Very sweet and almost no carbonation.  Admittedly though, Russian Imperial Stouts are not my favorite type of beer so Im glad I didnt spend 3 hours in line to get some to take home.

Nose was overripe dark fruit, burnt caramel, roasted malts, chocolate and molasses. Appearance was absolutely magnificent. Mouthfeel was gloopy and sticky. Flavors were too much soy sauce for my liking, incredible amped up sweetness (I thought I liked sweet beers, but this was just syrupy sweet) almost like drinking molasses. I can see how this has the potential to be an incredible beer. Heres to hoping the other years will bring a better opinion.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

<P>08 Bottle Re-rate:  Midnight black, no head...Wow, this has much more of the roasted/dark malt emphasis than last years.  Some of the dark fruit notes are their to compliment the chocolate and malt tones but not in a cloying way.  Coffee notes are actually quite prominent as well this year.

Super thick palate, probably the thickest Ive had.  Taste is a blast of cocoa, roast, and heat.  Theres a mild dryness in the finish, but a lot of roast as well.  A unique brew.","Florida, USA","JMFG"
1016,"2007-05-04",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2008 07 Bottle. Thanks to NachlamSie!! Pours uber dark black, even against strong light, no reds or browns are visible. A small, but thick brown head sits richly atop. When swirled in the glass, the sides retain an oil-like coating of brown. I am very impressed by the appearance. Aroma is strong on all fronts, heavy hops, chocolate, molasses, even some oaky notes, not as much coffee as I had expected, but it doesnt suffer from its lack of presence. Flavor is thick molasses, a nice bit of dark chocolate, hops that seem to have worked their way through hell to deliver a perfect balance, and a finish of sweet vanilla. The alcohol is hidden very well, and only really detectable when the beer is at a lower temperature. As it warms, the alcohol becomes much less apparent. The mouthfeel throughout is unrelentingly thick, and absolutely perfect for the style. 
08 bottle courtesy of BossHossbikes. Thanks man! Lighter in the mouthfeel, a bit thinner in the aroma, but very sweet and alcoholy. Still awesome. Revisited the 07 again as well tonight. Better than I remembered.","Sevierville, Tennessee, USA","muenster"

The beer pours a very thick, pure stream of blackness topped with a small and very dark tan head.  Aroma is some bourbon-ness, a fair amount of coffee, some sweet alcohol esters, and a hint of cherry.  Flavor is exceedingly smooth, and it subtley builds to a very full yet not overwhelming coffee-ness.

1016,"2007-05-01",5.0,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2008 2007 bottle with silver wax.  This is my most anticipated beer I have had so far so it has a lot to live up to.  Pours pitch black with a tiny bit of rusty bubbles that soon form a circle and disappear forever.  In the glass it is dark black with a deep red color around the edges.  As I drink the beer it stains the glass brown and stays that way.  Very cool looking.  The aroma improves as it warms up, peaking close to room temperature.  Very roasty and chocolatey at first.  After awhile there is some alcohol underneath but it is not unpleasant or overpowering in any way, which is impressive with such a new bottle.  The first sip I notice first the extreme richness and the ridiculous thickness in the mouth.  This has the best mouthfeel of any beer Ive ever had.  Extremely thick, creamy, and chewy.  The chocolate and roastiness come through in the flavor in a big way with some bitter coffee, chocolate covered cherries, and some hops buried in there somewhere.  I can feel the alcohol warmth but cannot taste any.  Amazingly balanced and complex.  This lived up to the hype and I honestly cannot see any flaws.  I cant wait to see how this ages.  

Re-rate.  Almost a year exactly after I tried this, my highest rated beer, I figured I should revisit it with the new vintage being released.  In the last 364 days I have been able to try the 07 version half a dozen more times plus an 05 and an 06.  All have been different, sometimes Im disappointed and sometimes Im blown away.  The 5.0 rating stands for the first time I ever tried this.  I am not entirely sure it is truly a 5.0 beer but I was blown away that first time and my rating will stay to reflect that.  

The black waxed, 08 version releases intense aromas from feet away when I pop the cap.  It pours that same beautiful, extremely dark and thick black color with a rusty cap.  The head formation and retention are better at such a young age than I expected.  First aroma detected is intense cherry.  If I didnt know what this was Id think its a cherry stout.  Fresh, ripe cherries, not that aged dark fruit smell that some other imperial stouts smell like.  Other aromas are chocolate cake with vanilla icing, pudding, slight coffee, chocolate covered cherries.  I know of no other beer that smells like this.  Flavor is rich as hell, smooth, sweet with a wonderful balanced fresh fruit flavor with some chocolate.  Creamy, chocolate cake and brownies, mocha.  Super long finish thats fairly bitter, full mouthfeel (but of course).  The heaviness in the mouth is just gorgeous, something I now crave in all imperial stouts but very few provide without being cloying.  Its hard to compare the 07 and 08 versions to decide which is better.  Suffice to say this beer still rocks.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"
1016,"2007-05-01",4.9,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2008 22 oz bomber.  Silver wax (2007).  Pours black, no head... a syrupy dark liquid which leaves brown resin on the glass when gently swirled.  Smells perfect... a nice blend of bitter chocolate (!), coffee, and something sweet... dark fruits and I guess what must be the molasses.  Feels so smooth in the mouth, and the alcohol is surprisingly well hidden, but noticeable. (Isnt that a given at 13%?)  Gets better and better as it warms.  This stuff left my once-clean glass looking like I spent a day rinsing paintbrushes in it.  Absolutely fantastic.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","DeweyDell"
1016,"2007-04-30",4.9,"UPDATED: AUG 30, 2008 This is pretty much the Holy Grail of stouts. Now I truly understand why theres such a huge deal about this stuff. Like the label on the bottle says ""the consistency of motor oil and hints of chocolate, coffee and molasses."" I wont bother giving it my own description----its just one of those stouts where you have to try it in order to understand its potency and flavor. One of the best Ive ever had.

1016,"2007-04-29",4.6,"2007 silver waxed bomber.  Pours black with a thin dark tan head that eventually fades to a thick ring and a thin film.  Huge aroma of roasted malts, dark chocolate, vanilla, raisins, molasses, char, cherries, alcohol.  There are some faint oats as well.  Coffee and roasted malts are at the forefront of the flavor, and vinous characteristics show up next.  Molasses, vanilla, cherries, and oats appear as well.  There was some light salted nuts and soy somewhere in there.  Roasty semidry finish with some alcohol warmth.  This is incredibly well balanced--every time I want to say its sweet some pleasant bitterness rears its head.  Low carbonation with a full creamy body.  I do not believe I was disappointed--delicious.  I never did get to try the 2004 to see the amount of sludge, but I was told the 2007 had almost as much--my bottle didnt, just a thick film at the bottom.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

Strong aroma of espresso, nuts, vanilla, molasses and chocolate, with a variety of other interesting aromas that come out on a swirl of the snifter.  Flavor is almost like a really nice shot of espresso, with a similar profile from start to finish, even down to a slight bitter bite on the backend.  Palate is full, a bit oily, and creamy.  I think overall this is a great IS, and seems to deliver on all the hype, but think I would take some of the other highly rated Impy Stouts every bit (if not more) than this.  Either way glad to be able to give it a try!","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"
1016,"2007-04-20",3.4,"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2010 2006 Bottle, courtesy Slob at a long vertical and horizontal run of excellent imperial stouts @ statelineliquors.com. Poured deep brown, pretty much all black color with a nice large bubble brownish head with decent retention. The aroma was fruity (cider actually came to mind), dark fruits like raisins, resinous pine too. The flavor was raisins, light maple, cider, some licorice and chocolate, but not a bit of coffee. Dont they intend coffee in this thing? Just wasnt there. Caramel and dark malts all present, with a touch of pine and even citrus hopping in the finish. Hops were much lower than anticipated, as was any coffee factor, not what I expected from a beer with this much hype, although nice nonetheless. I would have opted for more of the AS Speedway, Deschutes Abyss, and Stone RIS all over this one after running them all together. While this may have been an ""off"" vintage for 3F, I continue to be underwhelmed by their products (short of Dreadnaught) relative to the hype. Sorry. Nonetheless, Im every so thankful for Bert and his generosity. Statelineliquors.com rocks! Sept 07 horizontal (bottle courtesy moejuck) against AS Speedway, DFHWWS06, HF BORIS, and Expedition, same as my last horizontal w/ the 2006: lots of dark fruits, too much raisin (grapes showed up on the run back down in the horizontal, yet still not in a good enough way), sticky, flat, bleh. Low hops? About as disappointing as the 06, 3F being the most over-rated brewer in the US, minus Dreadnaught. Light lingering unpleasant bitterness, roasty type bitterness in the aftertaste. Thanks, Joe! Re-rate, at NSSRQSOSLT, 1/10, bottle shared by Gabe/GMCC2181, moving up a bit after this experience. Still an over-rated beer in my mind, but this thing was big and it held its own over the night as one of the best brews. Dark fruits were still prominent, but the body seemed to be backed by more chocolate, and the hops played a firmer balancing role.","","User37895"
1016,"2007-04-18",4.5,"Bottle at Chris_O bottlefest 2007.  Thanks to Kevin and maeib.  Black with tan lasting head.  Aroma has lots of intense malt.  Very much in the line of a USA impy stout.  Soy sauce intensity in mouth.  Pretty good espresso.  Its a little different in the mouth to most impy stouts.  Smoother.  Hoppy smooth oily bit of tobacco.  I liked it very much.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
1016,"2007-04-17",2.9,"Bottle courtesy of Tpaliga (2006 vintage drank in April 2007): Poured a pitch-black color stout with a small foamy head with average retention. Aroma of honey and sweet malt is overwhelming and somewhat interesting. Taste is way sweeter then expected with some alcohol hint. Body is full and has a creamy and oily texture like I have never seen or tasted before. Low carbonation is to be expected but the alcohol really comes out and I didnt enjoy this part. Some subtle vanilla and roasted malt were noticeable but were for most part covered by sweetness which kind of got gross after half a glass. This beer kind of reminded me of Avery Meph with the dominating sweetness and alcohol. Im glad that I finally had the chance to try this highly coveted beer even thought I am not the biggest IS fanatic out there but unfortunately I wasnt fond of it in the end.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
1016,"2007-04-13",3.4,"22 oz bottle (2005):  Black w/ a deep, big tan head.  Aroma is slightly smoky at first, then alcohol kicks in w/ a light raisiny fruit followed by toasted, caramel, and nutty malts.  Chocolate and light roasted malt as well.  Mildly sweet w/a  bit of raisiny flavor, light coffee & chocolate w/ a semi sweet finish.  Some carmel flavor sneaks in mid palate, but for being 2 years old, seems to lack a lot of complexity.  Full body, lots of alcohol warmth, and medium low carbonation.  Im probably going to be crucified for saying this, but I am horribly disappointed by this beer!  Its not a bad beer, but for me, it just doesnt live up to its reputation in my mind!  Maybe in this case I might be my own worst enemy...Anyway....","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

1016,"2007-04-06",2.5,"ChrisFest Big level of expectation on this one due to its reputation. Probably the beer most of us were looking forward to experiencing. Taste is intense. A full mouthfeel which borders on obscene - too much plastic and alcohol for my palate. Hops are very heavy, again a little bruising for my taste,  leaving little room for fragrance or flavour; I pick up intense bitterness which comes over as crude and simplistic with no variation. A big spoonful of Marmite. Marmite spread thin is wonderful, but eating a huge spoonful is too much, and that is how I feel here. Lots of sweetness; lots of bitterness; and not a lot in the middle. I understand and appreciate that people do like the intensity of beers like this, but it is not the sort of thing that I like.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

Large bottle at Chris O’s extravaganza. First off a BIG thanks to Mark for bringing this and also credit to Kevin for the original supply. This was easily the beer of the day and I am sure none of us expected otherwise. Appearance is certainly one of the best I have seen. Thick, oily and clings to the glass with the tenacity of a barnacle to the underside of a boat. Aroma is almost understated but still very good indeed. Thick, sweet, roasty malt and definite marmite. Flavour is superb. One of those beers that upon your first sip you can do nothing more than stare into space for a while. There was a definite hush that fell over the room when this opened. Full bodied and complex with not just notes but a huge fanfare of coffee, vanilla, raisins, roasted malt, liquorice and Belgian waffles. Palate is as good as it gets. I loved every minute of this one. Took me 5 washes to remove the residue from the side of the glass. Finally hats off to Mark for putting the last bit of this to the side so there was some left to Sim who was on her way to join us.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
1016,"2007-04-06",4.4,"2006 bottle. Ah, the venerable Dark Lord. Glugs out of the bottle with the darkness and viscosity of motor oil that hasnt been changed in 30k miles. An inch high whipped mocha head rises to the surface and sets up in the glass, clinging to it with an oily, almost bacon greasy ring. Damn, this is some crazy looking stuff. Aroma isnt over the top, but Im definitely picking up some big roasty malts, bittersweet chocolate and molasses . The coffee seems to hit more in the taste, along with some caramelized raisins, vanilla and rich maple syrup/molasses. Theres definitely a lot going on here. Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and full bodied without next to zero hotness. An impressive stout for sure. Does it live up to the hype? Partially. But I think you can pick up some other impy stouts with 90% of the quality/characteristics of this one for far less $ and difficulty. Nevertheless, the Dark Lord is worthy of at least a pedestal next to the throne.","San Diego, California, USA","alohaC"
1016,"2007-04-02",4.2,"22oz 2006 bottle from CaptainCougar (thanks to secret santa for the backup, as well).  Aroma:  Roasted barley, chocolate, anise, caramel, dark fruits (raisins and prunes), molasses, cream.  Alcohol is there, but not hot or unpleasant.  Appearance:  Oily looking black in color.  Dark tan head was small and creamy and looked almost like a crema on an espresso.  Nice lacing.  Flavor:   Nice roasted malt character with big notes of coffee and chocolate.  Molasses and light vanilla, raisins, cream, and a touch of port wine.  Medium bitterness.  Some lingering bitterness and roast after the finish.  Alcohol is smooth and pleasant throughout.

Id volunteer to kill your enemies but i know you can do that yourself.  It would have been easy to open this earlier in the proceddings but discretion enabled it to last well into the afternoon.  A black beer with a smaller than expected beige head.  A very thick beer which leaves great notes on the side of the glass, and a treacle thick deposit on draining.  The aroma is full and malty.  LIcquorice and soy are to the fore, but no real roast or coffee notes.  The taste is very thick and full bodied.  Again more soy and licquorice notes than other stout characters.

1016,"2007-03-26",4.8,"UPDATED: AUG 1, 2013 2004 Vintage:  The first ever Cincinnati RateBeer Gathering was held at Dilly Deli in Mariemont, Ohio (near Cincinnati) on 3/23/2007.  The turnout was pretty good.  This was mostly going to be a meet and greet at about the best place around to get craft beer on draught, but Tmoney99 surprised everybody by carrying in a bottle of 2004 Three Floyds Dark Lord to share!  Needless to say, I cannot thank him enough for sharing this rare bottle.  I really appreciate the kindness and generousity.  On top of that, this is the first taste ever of this nectar to touch my Dark Lord virgin lips...

Let me start by saying that this is what beer is all about.  Unbelievable...  Dark Lord pours a pitch black tar color with a small mocha-colored head.  The aroma and flavor are full of so many great things that are so well blended and balanced that they are almost indescribable.  Actually, at first I couldnt decide if I should drink the beer or just sit there and smell it all night.  Anyways, heres my best attempt at describing the many nuances in the aroma and flavor:  Sweet port, dark chocolate, caramelized and highly roasted malts, coffee, charcoal, and a hint of smoke.  Its amazing how difficult it is to take detailed notes once you get lost in such a comlex and mesmerizing beer such as Dark Lord!  The alcohol is amazingly well hidden for 13% ABV at first, but once the temperature of this beer passes a certain point (close to room temperature), it has a hot alcohol bite and the flavor turns to a caramel, chocolate, and molasses blend.  Dark Lord is about as full-bodied, thick, chewy, and viscous as a beer can get and leaves a lasting brown film on everything it touches including the glass and the inside of the mouth!  This characteristic reminds me a lot of Goose Island Bourbon County Stout.  To sum it all up, Dark Lord is an incredible beer that everybody should have the privilege of trying at least once.  This beer would be a perfect five if it werent so expensive and so hard to get...  22 oz bottle (red wax).

2005 Vintage:  Sampled from a 22 oz wax-sealed bottle on 4/28/2007 (DarkLord Day 2007) at the Hampton Inn in Munster, Indiana...  My least favorite of the various vintages so far.  It seems to have a lot more ccocoa bitterness and dryness to it.  Not quite as intense or complex and the other vintages...

2006 Vintage:  Sampled from a 22 oz wax-sealed bottle on 4/28/2007 (DarkLord Day 2007) at the Hampton Inn in Munster, Indiana...  Very similar to the 2004, but not quite as good.  My second favorite so far, but the 2007 might prove to be even better with some age...

_________________________
2007 Vintage:  Sampled from a 22 oz wax-sealed bottle on 4/28/2007 (DarkLord Day 2007) at the Hampton Inn in Munster, Indiana...  This one is pretty darn good and will probably be great in another 6 months or so...

2009 Vintage:  Sampled from a 22 fl. oz. wax-sealed bottle shared by Bigmmartin on 8/01/2010 at the Cincinnati RateBeer Gathering (NATIFEST 09)...  Typicl Dark Lord appearance, but the aroma and flavors seemed to be lacking complexity and depth.  Instead, this beer is just overly sweet and sticky with TONS of caramelized malts and some darker characteristics (kind of like Tootsie Roll though), but the sweetness is nearly overwhelming, even for this particular beer!  
_________________________
2007 Vintage:  Having this beer to celebrate Dark Lord Day 2010 today (4/26/2010) since I couldnt actually be there this year...  Aroma:  Dark chocolte; smooth smokiness/char notes; anise; vanilla; lots of caramelized malt depth.  Appearance:  Slow, thick black pour; no foam on top; loosing carbonation, but still okay to me for style.  Flavor:  Extremely complex ; all types of rich chocolates; high end java; subtle char, smoke and vanilla; cocoa nibs.  Palate:  Full-bodied; mellwo, creamy, and smooth; slightly chewy.  Overall:  Still fantastic, but it might be starting to wane a bit...

Taking over and coating it more and more with every sip.
A very well put together beer that has many o flavors going on. Some very smooth chocolate and high end coffee. The alcohol was subdued and refined due to the aging.  Not as hot or dominating as a fresh bottle.

It was good, though there was a cough syrup like consistency that would leach in to the the flavor as well that was a little off putting.  Nice aroma, coffee, molasses, dark chocolate.  This was not a punch in the face like some horribly unbalanced Imperial Stouts out there.  This packed a lot of flavor with a beautfiully masked alcohol profile without presenting any over powering flavors.  Just a nice blend of rich malty flavors.  A touch of warming sensation accompanied this very full bodied brew.  Only the extreme viscuous syrup-ness of this one kept it from being extraordinaly amazing.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","kseecs16"
1016,"2007-03-04",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2009 on cask at the Night of the Living Ales 07. 2007 vintage. poured black and watery (cask). nose was loaded with coffee and vanilla. flavor was way too syrupy, reminded me a lot of kaluha. alcohol was very well hidden. maybe the beer is too young or the Dark Lord hates the cask. 3.2. 

12/4/07, 3 year vertical (05-07):  2005, pours black with tan head. nose of burnt coffee, doughy, chocolate, and really roasty. flavors are pretty sweet with brown sugar, loads of caramel, evolving into a chocolately, coffee, roasty, and sweet candy finish. pretty thick mouth feel with no alcohol taste. pretty sweet beer for sure, but the finish is a bit raw and roasty towards the end, a little too much to be perfect.8/5/8/5/17=4.3.  2006, pours black with tan head. nose is loaded with green apple, it is tough to get past it but some other notes of molasses and espresso. flavor has lots of sugar and green apple, some chocolate, espresso, and vanilla too. mouth feel isnt thin but is the thinest of the 3. I can only hope and pray that age takes care of the green apple. if there is one off batch of Dark Lord then this is it. 5/5/7/4/13=3.4.  2007, pours dark brown with no head. nose has lots of brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, alcohol, and very slightly sour green apple (more less than 06). flavor is loaded with molasses, honey, vanilla, caramel, some piney hops, with very mild chocolate and espresso finish. this is way too sweet right now and lacks a real chocolate and coffee presence. very thick body that coasted and stained the glass (only version in the vertical that did that) with no alcohol noticed. perhaps this could be great with several years of age. 7/3/8/5/15=3.8  Final Comments: Okay, 2005 Dark Lord is tasting good right now. I wouldnt say its worth the hype though. 2006 is a big mistake, the green apple hasnt aged out at all and probably never will. 2007 is overly sweet and although those sugars are complex the beer lacks any real chocolate, roast, or coffee presence. However, the 2007 could age wonderfully as it is clearly the less filtered of the 3. DL is using sugar in an impressive/intense way but also over bearingly lacking some sort of balance and typical stout flavors (a few would be nice here). Finally, 2004 Dark Lord was significantly better (much more chocolately) than all of these. Too bad that wasnt here tonight. 

5/3/08, 2008 vintage released 1 week ago. pours black with no head. nose of coffee, raisins, caramel, dark chocolate, and citrus. flavor have a bit green citrus hop character, coffee, roast, molasses, dark chocolate, and still way overly sweet. couldnt taste a lick of alcohol. full bodied but not as thick as the 07 and this didnt stain the glass. i think this will age wonderfully and with any luck will taste like the well aged 05 vintage in 2-3 years. I think this vintage closely resembles the 07 but I do prefer this vintage over the 06 and 07, but i dont recall the 05 fresh and never had the 04 fresh. However, the 04 and 05 were far superior with 2-4 years on them. Those two vintages aged had a more balanced sugar level with more balancing roast and chocolate character. Hopefully the 07 and 08 will age into that with a few years. 7/3/8/5/16=3.9. 

7/12/08, 04 vintage. thanks Blake! pours black with no head. nose is extremely sweet but wonderful port, raisins, sugary. flavor is extremely sweet chocolate, dark fruit, coffee liqour. wow just really great brew. I wish the other DL vintages tasted like this. this is amazing.4.4. 

11/3/09, 09 vintage shared by 17thfloor! pours black with no head. nose of licorice, chocolate, alcohol. flavor is chocolate with dark fruit and licorice. oddly thin body for dark lord. not very good. 3.3.  



12/19/09, 2006-2009 vertical tasting. 
2006: pours black with creamy tan head. nose has coffee, soy sauce, smoke, dark chocolate, and cardboard. flavors of dark chocolate, raisins, espresso, cardboard, with a mild soy sauce finish. thick body and after 2 yrs or so the green apple notes are gone! Too bad it took so long for the green apple notes to fade out that oxidation is setting in and this one doesnt have much time left. Tasting pretty good right now and many considered this the best in our vertical (which I gave a nod to the 08). 7/4/8/5/16=4  

2007: pours black with no head. nose has smoked meats, fusel alcohol. flavors of dark chocolate, sweet raisins, smoked meat, and honey. a thin body (as far as dark lord goes), probably the thinnest dark lord ever. initially that chemical and hair spray notes were present but faded as it breathed. my least favorite dark lord of all, it might get a little better next year but Im not holding out hope. 6/3/7/3/13=3.2.
 
2008: pours thick black with a creamy tan head. looks great. aroma is smokey toasted grains, chocolate, and piney hops. flavors got some of that piney hop notes, dark chocolate, dark fruit, sweet molasses. very thick dark lord (almost 04 thick), will still some of those hops which makes it the hoppiest dark lord in several years, this vintage has great aging potential. 7/5/8/5/16=4.1
 
2009: pours black with no head. the aroma is extremely sweet, sweet raisiny notes with honey and molassess, rather green too. initially smelled of bananas but that faded out. flavors are extremely sweet and green, honey, currants, molasses, chocolate. wow you get a sugar high from this one, in a guilty pleasure sorta way im kinda digging the sweetness of this. rather low carbonation which i think makes it seem like a thin body but the body has a heavy sweet quality to it as I let it sit on my tongue. 6/3/8/3/15=3.5
 
Final thoughts: Ranked in order of preference would be 08,06,09,07 (this also happens to be the order of thickness).  08 has great aging potential, 06 is going downhill, who knows with 09 perhaps it could meld together better but who knows with this one, and i dont have high hopes for the 07 as it is thin and odd and still hasnt improved a whole lot from when it was 1 yr old.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

Body was thick and lovely, just like I like it, with hazelnuts, chocolate, hint of vanilla, and roasted malts.  Thye created a very nice balanced sweetness.  The finish is smooth as hell.

1016,"2007-02-07",4.3,"So here it is. I planned on drinking this one on my birthday but the keg of Old Rasputin prevented that from happening. I definitely wanted to taste the famous Dark Lord on a clean palate. 2006 version. The beer pours like a typical Imperial Stout without a bunch of carbonation. Slight trace of brown head on top. Oily black. Looks good. The aroma hits me first with Espresso before revealing some chocolate and perhaps a bit of port wine. Smells really good but not mind blowing. The taste......HOLY SHIT THATS GOOD! Amazing espresso flavors lead into chocolate into wine like alcohol notes into a sweet brown sugar finish. What strikes me most about this is that the appeal doesnt really come from complexity. Ive tasted what I taste here before. Its the volume at which these flavors come screaming through that blows my mind. As with a lot of top 50 type beers, I expected this one to be very good but overated.

Now like many Ive been really waiting for this beer for a while, and I cannot hope to match most reviews, but this is serious shit.  This beer is potent strong and sweet.  Coffee, sweetness and smoke, and roastiness all come together to form this fantastic beastlly Imperial Stout, I look forward to having this again with more contemplation.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"

1016,"2007-01-05",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2007 Dante wrote about the nine circles of hell in his Divine Comedy.  I think we need a tenth, just to make the center that much blacker and colder, because theres a new Evil in town.  Never have I tasted something more unholy than this liquid Lucifer beer, commonly known as Dark Lord.  Uttering its true name in the ancient, lost demonic tongue would cause your head to explode, at best.  Every liquid ounce is pure evil, fabricated from the sins of humanity, siphoned off as they commit their vile deed and passed through a thin veil of nightmares, during which it is made into a liquid.  After that it is mixed with the tears of orphans and puppies to completely bastardize it.  Finally it is approved by litigation lawyers and sent away to be bottled.  This stuff is evil even to Evil.  It is said Hecates herself deigned to drink it.  The three witches of Macbeth all cowered when presented with a glass.  Even the Four Horsemen, after they convened on on-the-spot council, declined on the premise that they had very important work to do and could not be bothered.  Dark Lord is at once cold and frostbitten, devoid of heart and spirit.  Yet it is fuming and raging, belching and cackling sulfurous clouds.  It is a manifest imp of the underworld, with its sly and subtle qualities, but also a tyrannical arch-demon thundering and booming with eulogies proclaiming the burning of our mortal plane.  The unopened bottle quietly quakes with an unspoken rage, but when the cap comes off only a few wails of regret slip out.  The pour is oily and seductive like a snake slithering from a burrow, eyes alight like shining opals.  It is black like a heart rotten with gluttony, decrepit and moribund, and still like bog water.  A small head materializes with a dull crimson hue before it sinks back into the murky depths like a ghost ship in the fog.  The aroma whips and curls out of the glass, grabbing onto the nose like a piercing talon, telling its story of tempting chocolate truffle, peat, raisin, red wine, coco butter, tangy sweet cream, cinnamon, rye, soy sauce and cider.  It is enough to be seduced by this intoxicating perfume, but one must remember to resist the temptation.  Nobody commits evil while thinking about the consequences, after all.  Theres a trick, and this is but one of them.  Those with great fortitude and courage tarry forth, imbibing some of the venom.  Those who do meet with even darker and bitterer flavors.  Chocolate, espresso, coffee peat and teriyaki grimace in the darkness, slinking around the palate with oily texture and even oilier deviousness.  By the time the bottle is drained it is probably too late for salvation.  The drinker might as well condemn themselves to the heaviest shackles of the underworld, and thats where the sludge comes in.  Some say that its the sputum of Satan.  Others pontificate that its a mixture of night soil, rotten foliage and crushed black centipedes.  Whatever the raw ingredients, the final product is the most concentrate blob of sinful delight available.  The Catholic church itself personally denounced the Dark Lord Sludge on account of its potential for spiritual decay.  That hardly scratches the surface.  No doubt prolonged exposure could result in physical decay as well.  A small coating on the tongue of the stuff is enough to induce seizures, sending even the most pious man into a wild dance of panicked yelps and profanity.  Every trait, every drop, every sip is a foray into the dark arts, and should be considered as such when sitting down to enjoy it.  Beware, and keep a watchful eye  the Dark Lord is here and hes something fierce.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
1016,"2007-01-04",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 5, 2007 2004 Vintage, Remember Dark Lord is above all an event - youll try your hardest not to blow it out of proportion, youll introduce him quietly hoping not to stir panic - in a way its like Satan showing up for your dinner party. Theres a nefarious aura emanating from his mere presence that simply doesnt make for a smooth apéritif. The audacious or foolish might mingle for gossip but dont be fooled by his empathic air, beneath boils a blood so black that its Gorgonian stare will turn you to stone. I fell prey to the allure of this devil, unleashing it upon our impressionable souls like a malicious genie. It slithered from the bottle producing an abyssal orb, darker than the deepest chasms and so dense it was only after a moment in the glass that it mustered the strength to form a thin cinnamon cream, rising from below as Apollyons swarm of locusts. To the nose, chocolate truffles appear in their fullest form combined with a deluge of juicy hops and coffee. Subtle notes define this aroma, emphasizing Armagnac-soaked prunes wrapped in bacon, cherries, nutmeg, apple and coconut, as well as a hint of mint. The mesmerizing notes of alcohol are prominent acting as a puppeteer that dexterously plays fragrances together like marionettes. The liquid slides through your lips like butter, thick as crude oil and just as smooth. The bitterness of dark chocolate appears combined again with light touches of coffee and fig to which the burning spiciness of cayenne pepper and paprika are added. After each swallow a dry but satisfying truffle flavor coats the palate and warms your insides from the gullet to the tips of your fingers.


As if the first pour wasnt adventuresome enough, each subsequent quantity became more brown in color and more thick in texture to the point of yielding the legendary ""sludge"", which I must report is not a myth. Indeed consequent to the oh-fourness of this brew, shots of sludge turned into an epic struggle to avoid wasting a single drop of the rare ichor. Like melted chocolate, this oozing deposit coated any glass it touched in a thick waxy layer. Its flavor approaches an ultra-concentrated rendering of the beer itself, favoring the dense malts, black pepper and an alcoholic, intensely bitter sensation. Its a barely palatable form of chocolaty sewage that doesnt sit well on the stomach, but if its presence is necessary to the exceptional power of the liquid above (as I understand it is), I suppose its worth trying. When presented with a shot glass full of the sludge, my unsuspecting roommate clamored ""What the hell kinda beer is this?!"" concisely summing my impressions of Dark Lord. Peculiar, no doubt, Three Floyds masterwork is a newfangled attraction, producing its expected lot of excitement. Worth the trouble? If like me you didnt have to trade in your soul, I would say so.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"
1016,"2007-01-03",5.0,"06 bottle courtesy of Walt!!! Holy shit thank you!!!!!   Pours a thick thick lack, with a dark tan head, looks more like some 20-50 oil than beer.

Ladies and Gentlemen, we have perfection.   Thick like pudding, and feels as if there are 10 thousand angels dancing on my tongue.  Just the slightest alcohol burn, but it warms you up REAL nice.  Around the beer as it got farther down it left like a dark orange lacing.   I cant Wait!!!! and will do whatever i gotta do to have this again.

1016,"2006-12-29",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 18, 2007 From a 22oz Bottle, 2005 Vintage.  Deep black, viscous pour with a well sustaining layer of roasted foam.  Black tar.  Aromas of honey glazed brisket dance with some hickory smoke and chocolate.  Sweet caramels, pineapple, and even some musty scents of charred blue spruce bark.  Almost a bit of bourbony caramel characters as well, giving it a bit of a heavy complexity often only found in barrel aged examples of the style.  A bit of sweet vanilla mocha rounds out the bouquet.  Full bodied, sticky mouthfeel that only the dark lord can deliver.  Creamy carbonation.  A wave of sweet bourbony coffee caramels explode across the tongue, creating a wave of sweet, sticky chocolate liquore.  Some rich molasses silky coffee notes coat the tongue and sit there resting gently for awhile.  As the sweet flavorful malt notes fade from the palate, a dry roastiness takes over, cooling the tongue, leaving a dry coffee roast to linger.  As this slowly fades, another wave of spicy hops lingers on the palate for awhile longer.  There is no final smack - it just continues on forever.  Marvelous.

Backs off with some light toasted toffee sugars. Awesome! A literally viscous pour. Ive never seen a beer so syrupy. Rimmed with yellowish-tinged foam and a fringe of mahogany over dark black oil. Flavor is an interesting creamy rich shock of freshly brewed coffee grounds and toasted nut flavors. A lot of complex sugar elements from brown sugar to piloncillo to jaggery. The sweetness sweeps into a biting char crust and lots of oak and toast notes. A little coarse for me, but flavorful and intriguing. It swiftly moves into a cascading rush of primarily piney and resin-like hop quality, with copious saps and tree syrups. The malt mantains a steady balance beneath. Alcohol only lends complexity. Smacks comes together in all unique aspects, with fantastic warm nuttiness and general resin notes. A long, long draw with more barbeque. Lots of burnt and touches of tawny. Overall, its an amazing over-the-top package, with incredibly flavors, building and amazing depth. But, again like Batch 7000 the char is a little overwhelming and with Behemoth, the characters kind of overtake each, creating a lightly muddled sense. Here, the syrup quality is a bit distracting. A true novelty beer, but something to try for its amazing aroma and unique. Thanks Andy, for this awesome opportunity.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
1016,"2006-12-28",4.1,"Bottle, at RBSG Grand Tasting, July 2006. Id been sitting on a rating of Dark Lord done mainly from the sludge at the bottom of the bottle for a couple of years and had been looking for an opportunity to rate it properly since. And now I find myself at a late stage of the tasting, sitting with almost full bottles of Dark Lord, Speedway Stout and Apis Jadwiga Mead in front of me that nobody is clamouring for. Beer tasting can be tough but someones gotta do it. Theres not really any point in trying to add too much to waht others have said about this beer. Its a huge beast. Inky black. Imbued with chocolate, coffee, burnt malt and deep, rich fruit. Theres also a strong hop presence that makes it perhaps a teensy weensy bit harsh. And the alcohol did give me a bit of an afterburn. But these are minor quibbles. I do have to say that I marginally preferred the Speedway Stout that I sampled at the same time but I couldnt really articulate too clearly why.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
1016,"2006-12-23",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 1, 2007 2005. Black, evil, obscenely thick pour. Aroma is deep dark fruit barely noticeable because of the roasty espresso, alcohol and bitter chocolates. Molasses wouldnt taste this thick in a side by side. Monstrous flavor becomes really agressive above cellar temperature. Extremely well made IS.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
1016,"2006-12-13",4.6,"22 oz bottle, 2005 vintage, via TChrome.  Pours as black as sin with absolutely no light penetration at all.  Great creamy chocolate brown head with amazing retention.  Minimal thin lacing.  Aroma is thick and intense.  Huge roast and chocolate base with lots of espresso, chalk, alcohol, yeast, iron, and light notes of tar.  Flavor is roasted and burnt malt with tons of espresso and bitter chocolate.  Quite bitter and a little astringent, but it really works with this beer.  Absolutely no alcohol apparency.  Finishes with a little soy, tar, and licorice.  Mouthfeel is monstrously full bodied with a thick velvety texture.  The carbonation is so soft and well rounded it enrobes the tongue like a blanket and coats the cheeks leaving a long lingering finish.

1016,"2006-12-11",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2006 I recently had the opportunity to have a vertical of all three bottled versions of this beer.  A 2004, 2005, and 2006!!
2004-->Easily the best of the bunch.  Would get a 5 but I kinda wanted to average the score from my impressions of all 3 vintages.  This beers certainly lived up to the hype of the ""sludge"" and it had the consistency of a milkshake...I swear it was like crude oil.  It had aromas of chocolate, cherries, molasses, toffee, coffee, and so much more.  The taste was so sweet and thick with all sorts of flavors coming through, and the alcohol was present but far from overbearing.  There was also little to know carbonation to speak of.
2005-->This was probably the least favorite of the bunch.  It would have probably received a 4 maybe 4.1.  It was very bitter, astringent, alcohol smells mixed in with the other good flavors that were able to shine through.  That really took away from it.  There was a lot more carbonation in this one as well.  The bitterness also came through in the taste of this one.  It was good...BUT a far stretch from the 2004, or from being the top rated stout that it is.
2006-->I have had this one before with out rating, and never smelled the ""green apples"" everyone talked about, but after having  both previous vintages before this one I have to say that I really could smell it.  It was overpowering but it was present.  There was a lot of carbonation in this one as well...just about as much as the 2005.  There were some nice roasted flavors that were coming through on this one with a nice sweetness that balanced out the bitter roastedness.  I would probably give this a 4.4 or 4.5.  It was a damn good beer and I enjoyed it more than the 2005.  Alright...that is enough banter from me for now","Green, Ohio, USA","LeopoldStoch"

Motor oil jet black pour, with a thick lasting brown head which becomes lacing. This is the first beer I ever saw to change the hue of the glass that its poured in. The aroma is enormous choclateyness, peppery pumpernickel, (cucumberish?), tart fruityness, herbal notes, vanilla extract and too much else. Just get your hands on it to try and identify all the aromas. Viscous, thick and sweet. And its more balanced than expected. Gritty chocolateyness, subtle tart fruityness, herbal notes (maybe sage), peppery, big roasty mocha middle, prolonged smooth kilned notes, molasses, vanilla oakeyness, pumpernickel like dryness and a long beautiful mocha dry finish which balances the sweeter flavors in the earlier flavor profile.

Thick, flowing blacker than black liquid love with a brownish-yellow head. Beautiful lacing and was truly enjoyable to view.  Nose is full of character: dark fruits come first, followed by mollasses, sugar, espresso chocolate cream, roasted malt. Flavor is equally complex.   Very well balanced at 13%. Palate is thick and luscious as the apperance suggested. Hops hit the tongue sensors  towards the end of the gulp and blend in really well with the other bold resonating flavors.

2007 bottle courtesy of Footbalm shared with OldGrowth on 10/2/2007.  Thanks Eric. Didnt take notes on this one, but I will say that I did not find it as overwhelming as the 2006. I know everyone keeps saying that this years is better than last, but maybe it was the hype that made me rate this so highly last year.  I didnt taste any of  freshly cut green apples in the 2006 and I wasnt as impressed by the 2007 as I was the 2006.  The appearance was just as great, but everything else seemed a step back from my first experiences. Still an awesome beer that I will continue to seek out, but I think I like speedway more overall. 958417

1016,"2006-11-22",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 4, 2017 Thanks to JHop for this one. #1000 baby! A few things need to be said first though. Right before I opened the bottle, the only thing going through my mind was ""Sauron, the Dark Lord..."" from that Elf womans voice in LOTR. (Im an idiot) The other thing is that there have been many top 50 stouts that have let me down including Speedway, Stone RIS, WWS, and Thirsty Dog. As you can see, this wasnt one of them. Very black pour (not sure about darkest ever but definitely in the running) with a small to moderate dark tan head. Lacing fell apart later but started off good. Aroma is a load of everything. Chocolate, coffee, roast, a plethora of dark and dried fruits from raisins to currants, vanilla, licorice, wood, and some hops as well. The flavor is slick and oily. The finish brings some alcoholic and malty sweetness, but theres enough bitterness here to keep it interesting. Despite all the big flavors, this was very balanced. One of the few impy stouts out there that managed to be big and balanced. Lived up to the hype and I didnt think it would. Initially started off as a good beer, but as the bottle emptied the vanilla and coffee combined made for a suberb imperial stout. 2017 input: this isnt as much as a rerate as to tell more to the story. The day I had this I was also socially pressured into having cake with my team as it was a secretarys last day. TLDR: send me a new bottle to erase this awful memory. So I traded for this beer years ago, drank it, loved it. Glorious, please send me another. At the time I played Halo 2 and logged on to play multiplayer with friends. Within 10 minutes I feel horrible, I have to vomit and maybe more. I AFK from the game briefly and vomit, its awful. I return to the game, start shooting kids and within another 5 minutes the vomiting sensation is back. Once again I walk away from my Xbox and vomit. Once again - awful! Come back again, figure Im good at this point despite being behind in score. Another 5 minutes pass and I realize that whatever this is, Halo 2 will not be a priority anymore tonight. Hit the bathroom up again, vomit, diarrhea, I want to die. At this stage of the evening, Dark Lord is not good, but it cant be Dark Lord - right? This is approximately 8pm. For the next 8 hours, I rotate between trying to vomit and excrete. After several hours, theres nothing left from either end. Despite being in the shape of my life, I was exhausted - If I had a gun near me I would have pulled the trigger because nothing could be worse. For hours I rotated between sweating and chills. By 3-4am I pass out from exhaustion. If you look at my original rating, this all happened right before Thanksgiving. Hell, I had the beer the day before. I missed TG dinner and basically laid in bed all day recovering. When I went back to work on Monday I made a comment like, ""You wouldnt believe my weekend"" and half the staff asked if I vomited all weekend like they did. The cake that I didnt want and was pressured to consume was the culprit the entire time, not a beer ironically named Dark Lord.","California, USA","ABUSEDGOAT"

Freaking big body. 2004, we love you JCapriotti. Pours so black-hole-black that Marsi got sucked into the glass, leaving Blursi behind. Vinous, soy like and roasted aroma which spreads in the whole room with tones of dark fruits such as plums, figs and raisins. Undertones smokey liquorice, cocoa, coffee beans, vanilla, molasses  and raspberries. Fantastic medium sweet flavour with molasses, chocolate, soy, liquorice, vanilla, light tar and honey. Oily, smooth and velvetly mouthfeel with a complex, lingering aftertaste with soft tones cocoa, sweet liquorise and molasses. Light soft bitterness with tiny tones of hops. Full, unique body. This is just fantastic. And now to the sludge: it´s like very bitter chocolate mousse with some molasses, and yes its very, very muddy but surprisingly smooth mouthfeel wise. I love this and if Marsi would still be alive she would had loved it to.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","Marsiblursi"

1016,"2006-11-07",4.7,"Enjoyed a sample of the 06 vintage at Tasting in the Woods, Part Duex. This beer pours to a ink black color, with tall, rocky, tan head, and a soft carbonation. The nose on this beer is fantastic, with lots of big aromas of dark chocolate, espresso, licorice, molasses, and peppery alcohol. The palate is slick and oily on the tongue, with tremedous flavors of dark chocolate, licorice, fig, molasses, and roasty espresso. This beer finishes with more of those robust and intense flavors, then ends with a soothing, warming, peppery, alcohol burn that lingers. Dark Lord lives up to the hype. Clearly this is one of the most impressive Imperial Stouts on the market today.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"
1016,"2006-11-04",3.0,"UPDATED: JUN 2, 2009 05 vintage: Thanks to footbalm for sending this to me awhile back.  Pour is black, deep and dark with a frothy brown head.  Aroma is very chocolatey, rich, and slightly boozey.  Very creamy and full palate--one of the best Ive experienced.  Taste is lots of chocolate syrup with a bitter kick in the end.  You definitely get some of the alcohol, but not as much as you might expect.  Incredible beer.

Update for new ratings:  This brew has become a shell of itself.  The ridiculous amount of raw sugar you taste ruins the experience.  The 2008 was average to above average, but 07 and 09 are horrible.  I enjoyed 05 as well--but many did not (green apples...).  06 was not good at all either.  I dont see these improving with age--but well have to see.  Right now I wouldnt drink a bottle of 07 or 09 if you gave it to me.

Sweet Roasted Coffee Beans mixed with a milky rich sweet chocolate flavor that tickles the tounge.  Surprisingly, there absolutely no burn. Unbelievably smooth for 13%.

I even detect some hops underneath the roastiness.  After the first couple drinks and even the first glass shared with a  friend... i was dissappointed and thought it was too sweet and cloying, but after a few sips of the 2nd glass....it is actually quite near perfectly balanced.

Big taste, tons of coffee, good sweetness but not overwhelming, plenty of warm melted chocolate, and only a light notes of bitter hops, mostly dominated by malts. Pretty  damn good.  Nicely balanced with bitter malts, sweet malts and balancing hops, that keep the finish crisp. While not a quaffer it is still quite easily drinkable.

Tastes of baking chocolate, coffee, and a nice batch of hoppy bitterness.  Absolutely delicious.  Wish I had this first when I came back from China.  It would have made up for the four years of Chinese lager.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","SJP"

This was very good i thought, but given its already high rating, slightly fell short of my expectations. But, as i say, this is very nice stuff. Black, with brown edges, looks menacing.

Poured into a large snifter, poured a great black - no translucence and the edges are slightly blood red.  A beautiful almost brown small head that quickly becomes a great lacing.  Aroma is strong - raisin-y chocolate, some alcohol - but nicely balanced.  Taste is weaker than I like with lots of bitterness.   Really bark-y.   Mouthfeel is just average.  After taste is toasty bitterness.  Really a beautiful beer.  8/5/7/3/16  Had a 2007 bottle (gray wax) with about a year on it, shared by some BA folks.  This has been my favorite version of Dark Lord.  It is way sweeter and thicker than any other.  Lots of licorice with molasses, bitterness is hidden behind the layers of adjuncts.  It really added to the mouthfeel that I though was lacking in the other versions.  It had crazy legs.  After I finished my sample, I poured water into my glass and had a copper colored beer. 8/4/8/4/16
Beer #3 of 13 in blind tasting.  
This was the first time I have ever had this beer blind and the results were surprising.  2013 bottle, almost a year old . Comes off as a big beer.  I thought it might be barrel aged but in hindsight just big and boozy.  Lots of alcohol. Lots of autolysis (soy sauce) on the nose.  Flavor has reduced negative aspects. 6/3/7/3/14.
In the aggregate, this was the worst scoring beer, strongly below the average (0.78 of a standard deviation below).

A huge, thick, and syrupy molasses coated chocolate coffee bean tossed around with hops and dark malts is what came to mind.  All the while the 13% ABV bites at the tongue throughout the taste.

Appears a pitch black with a dark tan, 3 finger head that slowly fades out. Spots of lace are left all around the glass.
Smell is of chocolate, toffee, citrusy hops, anise, coffee, oatmeal, maple syrupy/molasses and whiskey-ish...very complex and addictive.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas. Great mix of the aromas with a rich, tobacco like flavor mixed in to the mix of the wonderful aromas.
Mouthfeel is of rich syrup, full bodied, maple and malt sugars that stick to the palate with a remarkable hoppiness that is trying to come through this malt billed monster.

I was hoping to save this for a milestone, but like trying to practice celibacy, you can only go so long before you cave. 2005 bottle. Pours and looks like soy sauce, with a pronounced thin cinnamon head. Aroma of bitter chocolate, maple syrup, coffee grounds, and dark roasted malt. Initial flavor is sweet with notes of coffee, mocha, and molasses that transitions to flavors of currants, merlot, dark plums. More coffee complexities and bitterness come out as this beer warms. Some warming. A tad amount of stickiness lingers. I really expected more hop bite with this considering the brewer, but this was well balanced...probably because it has a year in the cellar. Does this beer live up to the hype? I think so. Overpriced...thats debatable, but I would gladly pay $18 for a bomber of this. 
Rating of 2008 Bottle- This stuff is very thick. Lots of sweetness on this version, joined by smoke, coffee, and chocolate. Bitterness is not as agressive as previous batches. Though young, this is still damn good and should age very well. Too bad I dont have a bottle to age. Its good, but not $50 ebay good.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"

Intense and incredibly rich flavour, smoke, licorice, tar, chocolate and roasted coffee with savoury leathery flavours.  A whole smorgasbord of dark malty complexity.  Easily the thickest and most intensely flavoured beer Ive ever tasted.  Intense, but still manages to approach balance.  Finishes like a combination of espresso and hot chocolate.  Alcohol is present but isnt obtrusive.  Its tough to write anything that hasnt already been said about this beer, but its definitely worthy of the praise that has been heaped on it.

Amazing aroma of dark malt, coffee, chocolate, dark fruit, hops, molasses and more -- its so complex, I spend minutes just smelling it. The flavours just as good: lots of coffee, caramel malt, dark chocolate, bourbon, dark fruit, brown sugar, alcohol and like the aroma, theres so much more going on -- right about this point Im seriously regretting sharing this with my fellow raters and considering demanding their samples back!

1016,"2006-07-01",5.0,"2006 bottle.  Huge thanks to Hopscotch for sending this my way.  Also have to thank TBC2 for sending me a second bottle, which allowed me to drink a fresh one.  One I peeled off the wax and opened this one, the entire area filled up with molasses and coffee smells.  Poured black, like night, with a tan head.  This was probably the darkest beer I have poured.  Took a sip, and damn! it was offensive.  I was going to be disappointed.  Let it sit for 15 minutes before attempting sip #2.  That was what did it.  When it was too cold, it was very sharp with alcohol, and not very good.  After the 15 minutes and warming up some it simply exploded with flavor, and the alcohol seemingly went away.  The beer was so thick it was about impossible to gulp.  Tasted sweet, full of cofee, and molasses.  Very smooth, and the best beer I have ever drank.  Hands down, perfect score.  Believe everything you read and hear about this one.  It is not replaceable, and its the beer that is deserving of a 5 if ever there was one.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"

Flavor kicks you right in the teeth with a bold malty flavor with a nice balance of coffee and caramel.  This brew was the wonderful.  Hands down, no question about.

1016,"2006-06-29",4.6,"Didnt know what to expect from this one. With all the hype behind it I didnt think it was going to live up to the expectations. It definately did! My new favorite Imperial Stout. From the pop of the cap things were off to a great start. My nose detected coffee, raisins, roasted malts, vanilla, and a hint of alcohol. It poured a deep black with only a hint of dark brown when held up to the light and was topped off by a small chocolate brown head. This beer looked thick in the glass. Flavors were roasty, chocolatey, slightly bitter but most of all sweet. There is a dry finish as well as some warming alcohol as it goes down. It is rich and creamy on the palate. That was understatement, it coats the tongue on every drink. Alcohol is present but it doesnt overwhelm. Surprisingly very drinkable. The best beer that I have had in some time, hands down.","California, USA","johnnypub"

Anyway, very generously shared by blankboy with myself, hogtown harry, gregclow, and jerc (2004 we think).  Pitch black, very dark head - looks great.  Wonderful chocolaty aroma, some roast and some alcohol - again, well done.  Incredible mouthfeel - and this is what separates many an impy in my mind - this feels like silk, yet it is so thick.  Taste is very complex:  chocolate, only a little alcohol (I like to feel some in these big beers), giving way to roast and a wonderful hoppiness.  Nice burning alcohol in finish.

1016,"2006-06-15",4.3,"22oz bottle, 2005.  Procured at From the Vine and enjoyed with the Beyer family in the Outer Banks.  Pours big, opaque and oily with no head (brown-black).  The aroma is strong with coffee though a toffee aroma manages to sneak through (somewhat sweet).  There is also burnt malt and if you really stretch your imagination you can detect some fruit deep down in the aroma (though I may have been trying too hard).  The flavor is big and overpowering.  Coffee and toffee immediately and predominately.  The are also some notes of dark fruit, tobacco, wood, and alcohol (but more present in the mouth feel really) that is somewhat wine or port like at times.  Wonderfully creamy and full body.  Really enjoyable but I think I will prefer this in another year or two.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

1016,"2006-06-06",5.0,"Its too dark, for one. The head is little and brown which is pretty remarkable considering the massive amount of alcohol in thisbut whats really on display here is the darkness. Think about the time before you were born and thats Dark Lord.

Were raised to appreciate two kinds of goodness in the worlds of taste and of smell. Theres the natural and the artificial. Cherry Jolly Ranchers taste good, and so do real cherries, even if they dont taste anything alike. This is a combination of the best natural, earthen, fruity, and grainy smells youve ever come across, along with the best unnatural, chemical smells. The thing is that these smells are natural, just so intense as to defy nature. Kids dont know the smells of unprocessed molasses, burnt grain, or wood smoke. This would seem like a medicine chest mixed with a cookie jar mixed with a walk in a fieldone whiff could scar a kid for life.

Too much complexity. On the very tip of the tongue it tastes like a dark wine, then it gets bittersweet, like fire roasted grain, browning apples, and molasses, then it gets regular sweet, like half-dark chocolate and a café mocha, and then it gets a little zippy, like Belgian alcohol and yeast. Thatsthats like youre falling down a hill of flavor and then you climb it back up again, from the valley of the alcohol, into the sweet, and then into the bittersweet, and then into the wine. Giving this to a child would be like giving them a bar of acid and taking them to Disneyland. Nothing would ever make them feel happy again, ever.","Waterloo, Iowa, USA","mynie"

1016,"2006-05-31",4.7,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2008 Rerate (2007 Vintage) 
Pour is no head, then it slowly appears, only to then again disappear into nothingness; blackened.  This demon has flavors of caramel, molasses, coffee, vanilla, licorice, and port.  This lives up to the hype.  Maintains the score of last years vintage.  I bumped up the Aroma score one, but deducted one point off of palate, due to the thick sludge towards the end of the bottle, which was just too itimidating for me to handle. 
Original Rating (2006 Vintage): 
I enjoyed this beauty thanks to El Gaucho who nabbed me a bomber from Dark Lord Days 2006.  First wax bottle so I had to do some peeling before I could crack open this beauty.  Pours black with an almost orange colored head.  The head, by the way, starts out thick and fluffy, but quickly disappears.  All thats left is what can be described as an algae film on a black opaque pond.  Strong vanilla, cherry, raisin, and soy meet the senses.  One taste and I can also detect some fairly strong coffee, molasses, and dark fruit notes.  A strong hoppy finish rounds this one of a kind brew out.  Can detect the higher ABV, although its not overwhelming.  Very good, and bordering on perfection.  Drank this as I was watching Francisco Liriano have a great outing for the MN Twins (over the Angels).  Now if their relievers can nail up the coffin it will be a very satisfying night!  (Oh yeah, in return I was able to nab 4 tickets to the Great Taste of the Midwest for my friend Winston, so everything worked out great!)

1016,"2006-05-23",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 25, 2007 2004 bottle. Opened bottle on Christmas Eve, one year after receiving it as a Christmas gift from SpudClampDawg. Midnight black pour with little or no head. Motor oil sheen on the sides of the tulip as you swirl it to release aromas of chocolate, licorice, molasses, orange, caramel, new leather, plum, vanilla and alcohol  a nose that changes in subtle ways as the beer warms. The flavor is moderately to heavily sweet in the front of the mouth, but turns moderately bitter in the finish  unlike the 06 version that stayed heavily sweet throughout. Still, some sugars do linger through the finish. Smooth mouthfeel. Long finish. Layers of complexity in both aroma and flavor and much better balance of sweet and bitter in the 04 version.
9-4-8-5-17

2006 bottle. The appearance of Dark Lord is inviting and near perfect. Jet black with a deep brown head of tight-bubbles. Swirling it around the glass, the beer sticks to the sides giving off a translucent sheen in the light. The aroma reveals something new with every sniff  molassis, brown sugar, fruits, apple, peppery alcohol. What is missing in the aroma is also missing in the flavor  roasted malts. Instead, every sip is sweet with plum, banana, sugar and molassis until bittering hops kick in at the end of the swallow. The roasted, burnt malts with a note of licorice are missing. The palate is smooth, thick and chewy. The finish is moderate to long and leaves you with a lightly bitter sensation. If this were a sweet stout, outstanding .... but its not. Its nonetheless quite an enjoyable experience even if this years batch doesnt live up to the reputation of previous years.

1016,"2006-05-23",4.4,"So close to perfection. Pours syrupy and black (insert bad poetic analogy here). Head is rather thin and begins to swirl to the edge of the glass faster than I expected, oh yeah the head is a reddish brown. Nose and aroma are the best part of this powerhouse of a brew. Stick your nose in and get a bitch slap of coffee, burnt dark chocolate some mild fruits like plum maybe, and a dash of bitter dirt smell ( translates better than it sounds). Optically this beer is a sneek, and betrays the juggernaut that attacks your sense of smell and taste. The flavor is a bit of a mystery to me and here is why:
First sip: A rush of revolting sweet malts.
Second sip: The same followed by a thunderfuck body slam of bitterness, and this pretty much repeats throughout. Flavors include sweet malts, bitter chocolates, coffee, some wierd fruit, and the most important soul crushing bitterness that only a stout can provide. So all gushing and attempts to be the wordy beer dork aside, the bottom line is pawn anything you have to just to taste this beer. Otherwise go get some expedition and come close.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TheBeerNinja"
1016,"2006-05-20",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 24, 2007 2004 bottle:Camerons 1st birthday and Christmas eve couldnt have been a more perfect time to enjoy this monster.  Pours a viscous oil can black with no apparent head.  A strange gold film lines the glass, not lace really, but kind of like sludge residue.  The aroma is leathery with lots of fudge, madagascar bourbon vanilla beans, plum and alcohol.  Creamy, chewy mouthfeel with velvetty smooth carbonation.  Not as sweet as the 07 version, this bottle still leaves lots of residual sugars on the tongue.  As it continues to warm, this becomes a milkshake and coats my tongue and mouth.  Complex isnt a complex enough word to describe the complexity of this beer.  Haha - Jenn drank the sludge.

2006 bottle: So check this out.  Kind of Blue on vinyl spinning in the backgroud.  Discussion around the table on how availability effects ratings.  And the Dark Lord sits and waits.  Thick, syrupy and dark as midnight on a moonless prairie night.  The mocha brown head insanely hugs the sides of the tulip with each swirl of the glass.  The first sniff is roasty, deep and tempting.  But wait, what is that lingering note of apple friutiness hanging above the great chocolate, roasted monster of a nose.  Hmm, odd and out of place.  Shaking head and moving on, the body is thick, almost viscous, but somehow not cloying.  More sweet chocolate, straight cane sugar at times.    Really sweet, with no alcohol presence - quite strange for such a high octane brew.  The chocolate is brownie like in sweetness, and lasts long through the finish.  The apple/fruity note continues to battle the roasted body, throwing things out of whack.  Some bitterness finally moves in and balances the insane sweetness and helps quell the fuitiness.  This is defintely good, but just a preview of what it could be (or has been in the past).  Ive waited so long for this, so I hate to leave it at this, but ""maybe next year""?  Oh Dark Lord, why hath though forsaken me?

1016,"2006-05-20",4.7,"Finally got to the BIG BOY for my 1000th rating.  Been waiting for a long time for this one.  Very large and insanely dense head of very fine bubbles.  I poured and then I watched for a full minute or more as the brew and head separated from itself.  A thing of beauty.  I almost dont want to drink it because it looks so good.  Head lasts for a lifetime.  Dark brown in color.  Heavenly aroma arises from thethick sheet of head that has become one with the glass.  Rich and meaty with loads of roasted malts, dark chocolate, a bit of anise, molasses, raisins and brown sugar.  Surprisingly very little coffee in the aroma.  Color is jet black.  No mistaking this one for a Impy stout.  Ok, here goes.  WOW.  Big roastyness in there.  Just as complex as the aroma.  This time the coffee shows up big time.  And a big alcohol warming.  Thick and chewy in the mouth yet goes down like silk.  This is a dinner in a bottle.  Many have mentioned that it looks like used motor oil.  I would not doubt it that you could put this into your car.  Hell, the car would probably thank you.  Loads of roastyness, oatmeal and molasses.  Little sweet.  Finish is thick and coating and glides down effortlessly.  Then the small fire in your stomach starts up and you can feel the 13% heat.  This is not a brew for the feint of heart.

1016,"2006-05-19",4.9,"Huge thanks to Ryan P. (Black95tt) for getting me 6 of these at the 3 Floyds sale. 

Appearance- motor oil with 20K miles on it. Black and thick as night. 1/4 inch chocolate brown head that grows then quickly dissapates leaving no cling to the glass.

Smell- Sugar, cherries, currants, slight anise, coffee and chocolate. So much going on its almost impossible to describe. 

Taste- Same as the smell. It hides the alcohol well till after a few sips and you start to feel the burn. This is very similar to Stone IRS but more so. Starts sugary and fruity and finishes slight chocolate and coffee. In my opinion, the best RIS in the world. 

Mouthfeel- Clings like cough syrup, chewy and clings like glue. Tastes so great you want it to stick around.

Drinkability- Simply immense, I just finished one and want to chill another and break it open. I wont though. These are going to be opened one every month. 3 Floyds is simply the best brewer in the country.","USA","kirok1999"

06 Really oxidized at this point.  Thin head on a oily black body.  Oxidized papery nose alcohol fruit and coffee.  Light sweetness charred coffee molasses, syrup, and burnt. Slightly hot and papery but I dont mind the oxidation that much.  It brings in another level to it.. Past its prime but not bad.  4.0

07  Nose of phenols, chemicals, plastic with the chocolate and coffee.  Chemicals fades to that smoky and coffee notes.  Sweet and sugary coffee flavors that are just tough to drink. Thick and sweet, the chemicals dissipate with sometime.  This makes it a better beer, but not great.  3.7

08  Nose of smoky coffee chocolate strong and inviting, not overly sweet, burnt, or chemically.  Thick sweet and creamy chocolates with red fruit underneath. Good chocolate and fruit but too sweet in the flavor.. 9/4/7/3/15 = 3.8

09. Nose of chemicals, phenols, and summer sausage.  Chocolate charred coffee flavors with alcohol heat and syruppy sweet. Too sweet tough to drink. 7/3/7/3/14  = 3.4

07 vintage on cask at NotLA 07.  Poured pitch black and thick with a small beige head that quickly faded away.  Nose of yeast sweet coffee and chocolate.  There is a lot of coffee here but that yeast gives this a bit of a odd twist.  Sweet syruppy flavors, chocolate, vanilla, very fresh.  This would be a lot better in a year to get those complexities out in this beer, but at this point, its too syruppy and sweet.

05 vintage - year and half old.  Thick dark black in color, looking very oily like with a  brown espresso like head.    The lacing ""clumps up"" in certain spots on my glass leaving a many legged unicorn that seems to be screaming with its mouth open and on my fiances glass a lochness like monster.  (i guess they dont call it dark lord for nothing).  Great aroma coffee, chocolate, fruit underneath, and alcohol.  Thick mouthfeel thats smooth and creamy, delicious as it rolls along the tongue.  Coffee dominates the flavor, slightly overpowering at this point actually.  With the coffee comes chocolate, molasses, licorice, vanilla, fruit, phenols, and more alcohol.  Finishes with a bitter bakers chocolate flavor.  The flavors follow quite a transition in my mouth and i really love every rise and fall of flavor on my tongue.

thanks to drewbeerme for this sample of 06 vintage fresh the day after dark lord day.  I drank one glass for well over an hour and the flavors continually opened up with the warming of the beer.  Molasses, coffee, roasted malts, a hint of vanilla, beautifully balanced with a surprisingly light flavor of alcohol.

1016,"2006-05-13",4.4,"This rare bottle came to me from BA mentor as a reward for setting up and maintaining the BIF 20 website.  The reward certainly far exceeded any effort I put into the site, so I decided to put the 22 oz. bomber away till it was a year old.  Now that all my guilt has faded away, and the beer should have mellowed a bit, it is time to get it out.

When pulled out the cellar, the flowing red wax seal looked as impressive as it did the day I got it.  Luckily, the wax was soft and easily removed with a pocket knife. The beer poured out dark chocolate brown, and possessed a mocha colored one finger thick head.  The body was completely opaque in the tulip.  The smell was very roasty and mellow, with coffee being very prominent.  Unlike many other brands of Russian Imperial Stouts, this one did not smell burnt at all.  There was tinge of toffee and molasses sweetness in the smell, as well as a hint of soy sauce.  The taste was quite a bit sweeter than I was anticipating.  This sweetness must have come from the molasses Three Floyds put in this beer.  The sweetness was supplemented by a little sourness, and chased by an astringent dryness.  There was very little perceptible hop bitterness here.  The mouthfeel was very thick and chewy, although I did not have the drinking sludge feeling reported by others.  
The drinkability suffers in my mind due to the lack of bitterness to balance things out.  With a creamy Havarti cheese to cut the sweetness, the beer goes down much more easily.


I liked the beer a lot, although I do think all the hype does this a little injustice.  There are better imperial stouts out there that are more readily available, but the laws of supply and demand elevate this one to a more sought out status.  After all that hoopla, this still only a beer.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Poured from the bomber black with a thick dark brown head that subsided into great lacing. Aromas of coffee, molasses, vanilla, and roasted malts with just a hint of alcohol. Flavor WOW talk about complex.  Trying to pull every flavor out was difficult. First to hit was a bitter coffee with a dark chocolate bitter. Following that was the sweetness of molasses then the hops come along and wake your senses back up. All of this is followed up with a touch of alcohol as it goes down.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","OldRaspy"
1016,"2006-05-01",4.2,"Thanks to BBB6 for providing the 2004 and 2005 version...My rating is a composite of all three years scores.

2006:
Ill echo the used motor oil analogy for colour, with a fairly small but tight and well formed head of toatsed brown. Very aromoatic with lots of chocolate, coffee, molasses, and a somewhat pronounced hop aroma. The beer was pretty thick with a big hint of molasses, a bit of vanilla, some coffee roastyness and chocolate. There is certianly a large hop bill in this and it tasted pretty green, piney resin like hops mostly.
9/4/9/4/18
2005:
Midnight black colour that was poured to form only a ring of dense tan foam. Full of chocolate, molasses, some vanilla, maybe a hint of cerry in there as well. I wasnt able to detect any hops in the aroma, and was somewhat surprised when that bitter resin like hops hit my palate. They felt a bit too pronounced to me, especially for a year of aging. I wonder how hot this beer was fresh. A great stout base, but too much grassy, piney hops in this one.
8/4/8/4/16
2004:
I just stuck my nose in my little plastic cup for what felt like hours. It was so deeply enriching I didnt want it to end. High-end bakers chocolate and thick molasses dominated. I had one of the first pours off of this one and it had a decent amount of sediemnt in it. This beer was so thick, sticky, and creamy that it coated my entire cup and would not settle back into the bottom of the glass. Heavenly! The flavour was so complex and full. Im honestly not sure where to begin describing it.

Aroma is full of rich  dark chocolate,dark sweet cherries,molasses,fine malts, and sweetened whipped butter.  Flavor is extremely complex and as rich and thick as an imperial stout can get.  A perfect blend of dark rich chocolate,expresso, marashino cherries,malts,plums and currants.  Leaves an aftertaste of slightly burnt molasses.  As good as it gets !!!

Spicy aroma with espresso, and more than a hint of.. Red apples(??). Heavy on the tounge, but not syrupy. Taste hits like a truck, very complex and rich. A little sharp, which I expect will mellow over time. Finish lingers on, like a pleasant memory. A fantastic beer, now. Give it a year to mellow, and it will be spectacular.","USA","SonOfSlam"

First sip, huge roasty cocoa /coffee with hints of citrus.  Extremely thick, coated my tongue instantly, I knew what to expect but it was much heavier than anticipated.
Lots of flavors melding together midway through.  Dark fruit, whiskey, coffee, and a touch of citrus.  I did not get a strong alcohol presence through the entire experience, quite impressive at 13%!

1016,"2006-04-22",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2007 Re-rate: 2006 vintage, had at the Nashville tasting.  Smells of port, bourbon, wood, alcohol and sausage.  Full as all hell in the mouth and smooth, flavor is mostly roasty and hoppy.  The chewy presence of this beer actually seems to *produce* phlegm.  A hard candy sweetness pervades the whole thing.  The sausage that I smelled peeks through every once in a while on the flavor too. 
8/4/8/4/16 = 4.0

Original rating: 2005 vintage, poured from bomber into Duvel tulip (first tasting) and a pint (second tasting).  Bought at Hyde Park Binnys, Chicago.  Opaquest black ever with a reddish-brown head that is both fizzy and foamy; head has great retention, leaves a beautifully sticky lacing and produces a very thick and deep arc of racing that takes forever to get back to the surface, belying the Lords thickness.  Smells strongly of buttered bread and coffee, with dust and mustiness overlay.  Full as all hell and syrupy in texture, it coats the tongue like an enamel; personally, I think its a bit too syrupy.  If Karo came in chocolate, this would be exactly like it, with some grenadine thrown in for an accent.  Roasty and dry finish is bitter at first, gets sweet and fruity, then tangy (kind of like fruity, but also evocative of sourdough bread).  Finish is long.  I wish I could have had the patience to hold one of these bottles for a while.  Im guessing with the body this thing has, it could survive the Apocalypse.

1016,"2006-04-03",4.9,"Girnormous thanks and cudos to Crosling for hooking me up with (and sharing!) a bottle of the 2005 batch.

The usual 22 ounce bomber, set out from cellaring and allowed to warm to about 55 degrees. Poured into St. Bernie tulip goblets, not light passes through this monster. Vigorous pour yielded a brown (with yellow edges?) large reverse cascading head that clung to the glass like molasses.

Smell of espresso, dark chocolate, burned cherry syrup, prunes, figs, and malted malt. Incredible: I just wanted to go on inhaling this aroma!

Taste is huge and chewy and tongue wrestlingly thick: this is like Yeti on steroid. Intensely decadent dark chocolate espresso malt with prunes and caramel and malt on malted-chocolate-covered-cherries. Took most of an hour to savour this: as it warmed, everything gets more intense, especially the chocolate.

Mouthfeel is the richest of any beer Ive ever had: simply decadently smooth and mouth-fillingly round. You want to swirl this stuff, not swallow it.

Drinkability is the only thing that hold this back. Wierd thing is that all the intensely enormous voluptuousness of the flavors and mouthfeel completely mask the 13.0%. Perilously drinkable.

A note: reserved the bottom half-inch to consume by itself. The 2005, unlike the 2004, doesnt have a lot of sludge at the bottom. However, there was a lot of flavor: that last half-inch was like the rest of the bottle concentrated into two small mouthfulls -- absolutely over the top.

Overall, a freakishly amazing brew, and I can see why people are after this with abandon. Thanks again to Crosling for the sharing! Astonishing.","Colorado, USA","ColoradoBobs"
1016,"2006-03-30",5.0,"UPDATED: MAR 17, 2009 100th rating, bottle courtesy of alaskaiscold, and this is a orange wax 2005 if Im not mistaken. I havent rated anything on here for about a week in anticipation of this bad boy...time to see if it was worth the wait. Pours absolutely pitch black with a creamy toasty,  brown head and I usually dont comment on the lacing...but this has some pretty damn nice lacing. The aroma is pretty potent...licorice, dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon,smoke, vanilla, dark fruits, and oak...lots of oak. The nose of this beer has a lot going on, almost serving as a warning for those who dont like huge beers, because that is exactly what it is. The flavor is even bigger with all of these things coming to mind: rasin, dark cherries,  bakers chocolate, coffee beans, smoke, bourbon, caramelized sugar, vanilla, oak, and alcohol...a bit sweet a times and bit bit too much alcohol in the finish. This beer is very rich, velvety over the tounge, a bit clumpy at times but nothing that really takes away too much.  The finish is very sweet/sour...a slight bitterness after a huge blast of sugary sweet fruit. I will admit that I was expecting something a bit less sweet, but Im always impressed with beers that are this complex. Also, while the presence of alcohol can be easily found, this stuff is hitting me harder than I wouldve expected...basically tastes like a 9% beer with the power of 13%... Ill be sure to share my next bottle with friends...good friends that is. After having every bottled vintage, I feel confident this is the best of the bunch. No other stout has matched its viscous quality, and when fresh, the hops looming inside add a amazing touch.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"
1016,"2006-03-30",4.8,"Pours a molasses-thick black. No light gets through, even at the sides. A thick, dense dark brown head forms quickly, and fades to a capper that just stays around for days.

Smells toasty and roasted, with hints of coffee and roast.

Tastes extremely complex, with an aftertaste that changes and fades for ages. Tip of the tongue is cashews and dark chocolate. Pushes back to cherries, grapefruits, and citrus, as the hops and sweeter flavors slam through. Aftertaste is again of dark chocolates, biscuits, and cherries, taking ages to fade. Alcohol hides very well, and just warms your throat at the very end.

Mouthfeel is thick, bubbly, and chewy. Pretty big, and gets ludicrously massive as it warms. Leaves a nice bitter toasty feel in the mouth.

This stuff is silky smooth, and very tasty. Watch that ABV! I could drink it all night, a real shame its so hard to find. Now I definitely need to grab one and age it for a while, see how it holds up.

Unfortunately, I dont think that I have the vacabulary yet to do this justice.  Interestingly, when I first poured, smelled and tasted, it didnt really do much for me.  I mean, it was a solid beer, but I didnt see where it came in as #1.  Either as it warmed or oxidized (I started at around 55 degrees), though, it really came alive.  Again, I dont really have the words to describe all that this was, but it was a unique experience.  Unlike the other ""big"" imperial stouts Ive had (Speedway, Expedition, Stone, DFH, Mephisopheles, Siberian Night, etc), this one was really balanced.  Not just bitter/malty balanced, but across the board.  Most of the other ISs are wonderful, but really hit you over the head with something: alcohol, sweetness, smokiness, fruits, coffee, etc.  The Dark Lord, though, especially as it progressed, contained all of these elements in a wonderful dance that I can only describe as unique.  I wish I had better words to communicate my experience.  While it doesnt have any significant attention grabbing attribute, its such a well engineered total experience that I was, at the end of the glass if not the start, blown away.","Seattle, Washington, USA","acertain"

1016,"2005-12-25",4.8,"hey_kevin was in the Christmas spirit a few days ago at his Iowa City gathering and opened a bottle of this.  2004 vintage poured very dark with deep ruby red edges.  almost no head due to a gentle pour.  This stuff is viscous!  it sticks to the side of the glass as I swirl it around.  The aroma is great.  I probably spent a good five minutes smelling this before I ever took a sip.  Sun dried fruits, bourbon, burnt wood, chocolate all come through.  All of that and more was in the flavor.  This was very mellow and sweet, with very little hops coming through in the finish.  Well balanced though.  Great mouthfeel, extremely full but very smooth.  Thanks Kevin!!!!!","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","Illini08"

Dark cap of head that has the look of suede leather, very fine textured and leaves nice lace as it settles. Rum, creamy vanilla ice cream, delicate sweetness, and very subtle roast. Much more roast in the flavor, and a very heavy hop presense. Intensely dark chocolate, and a lingering bitterness. Wonderful thick and smooth on the palate, like a chocolate shake. An impressive and memorable stout. Feels like a few more years might blend the components more harmoniously. Hops a little a aggresive right now, but not enough to be off-putting.

1016,"2005-11-29",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 19, 2006 2005 release. Where do I even begin? Im terrible at descriptive writing; consequently, I dont know that I can put the experience of this beer into words. But damn it, Ill do my best. Upon pouring this into the glass, one can notice that this is one thick, black beer. In fact, it gives new definition to both. A beautiful dark chocolaty head cascaded quickly receding to a thin lace. The aroma is roasted chocolate, coffee, molasses, burnt fruits and alcohol. This beer is wonderfully complex. Your mouth is greeted with a very thick and rich feel. Burnt chocolate and roasty coffee flavors kick you in the teeth followed by dark fruit, plum, and molasses. Finish is coffee and hop bitterness. This beer is like chocolate cherry cake in a bottle. The alcohol is very well masked. You would never guess this beer is as big as it is. Definitely the best impy stout, and possibly the best beer Ive ever had.

Notes from DL vertical tasting: 2004 is the bomb bizzle. Pours out super black with huge roasty aromas blasting you in the face. The taste is very sweet, but not cloying. Loads of chocolate and roastiness followed by dark rum soaked fruits and a bit of soy. 2004 is the bees knees. It does not get better. 

2005, although having rated it and enjoying it before, I immediately noticed its shortcomings when drinking it side by side with the 04. It had a very astringent bitter aftertaste that detracted from the overall experience, Im not sure if it was hops or roastiness...it was hard to tell. It was still very good though.

2006 was a step back in the right direction. It had all of the flavors of the 04, but without that harsh bitterness at the end. It couldnt match the oily mouthfeel of the 04 though.","Doylestown, Ohio, USA","black95tt"

1016,"2005-11-23",4.5,"Rating #1000.  2004 Bottle:  Almost 2 years old.  When originally sampled, this poured like an imperial milkshake, however, it has changed a lot over the past two years.  Beer pours black with a nice thick dark, red tinged, tan colored head.  Aroma is very rich with molasses, coffee, lots of dark chocolate, some yeast, alcohol and vanilla.  Flavor is also very rich.  This is totally a desert beer, because drinking this beer is very similar to consuming a chocolate cake.  Big rich chocolate flavors, with some roastiness, liquor infused cherries, no hoppiness left to be found in this almost two year old sample, but that is OK.  Thickest, most tounge coating, wonderful heavy palate ever.  Rated the day before Thanksgiving, USA.  Thank you Rate Beer, Nick Floyd, DFW Raters, all of the brewers who are hopping their beers to high heaven.  Thanks be to God for His mercy.  Bottom of the bottle is more like a remember, sludgy and brimming with yeast and hops.  At this point, only the final two inches of the bottle is wasted.

No light getting through this sucker.  Dark Brown head that faded to a ring and continued to leave decent lacing.  Aromas of cherry, molassas, chocolate and coffee.

1016,"2005-11-07",4.4,"Rating #200.  Bomber from Ughsmash.  So, I was able to converge my 200th rating with the biggest NFL game of the year.  Perfect time for a Dark Lord.When it comes to Impy stouts and aroma, DFHWWS is the benchmark.  DL comes close.   A lot going on in the nose (cherry, toffee, some metal when cold, caramel, some nuttiness, and even some cooked veggies)  Great bredth in the aroma, but the depth isnt there.  Maybe Im nitpicking.  When this is cold, the mouthfeel is very roasty.  Let me correct myself.  Very roasty.  Also some metal, licorice, chocolate, coffee, molasses and a few nuts. The finish is very nicely bitter (from the coffee) and dry.   Once you get to the second glass and second half of the bottle, it really starts to become chocolate cake ... a chocolate cake with a fudgey, evil, satanic filling.  By the end of the bottle, it starts to get a little too sweet.  Go figure.  Thank you, Jason!","Windsor, Connecticut, USA","SwedeDog"
1016,"2005-11-03",4.7,"22 oz. bomber courtesy of goldtwins.  This beer (my 369th) marks my one year anniversary on RateBeer.  An oily, jet-black pour with a HUGE and creamy chestnut head that leaves rows of lacing.  I noticed a good bit of syrupy sludge remaining in the bottle after I had poured the beer out.  The incredibly rich aroma features plenty of molasses, vanilla beans, coffee and chocolate.  Hints of plums and dark cherries in there too.  Thick, chewy and syrupy all the way.  So unbelievably roasty and chocolate cake-ishly rich!  Sweet chocolately malts start off and transition to an equally sweet, molasses middle.  Finishes with some powerful hops that linger.  Vanilla, cream, cocoa and hints of cherries are present throughout.  Burnt toasty tastes poke their head out at the end and become a little overwhelming.  Otherwise, this is one of the most drinkable big beers Ive ever encountered.  The alcohol is deceptively well-hidden.  The Dark Lord punished me by the end of the bottle.

The aroma is so roasty and so mysterious.... wow. Hints of plum, coffee and molasses abound through that carbon roast that just eminates from the glass. Tasting it is much more of the same. Assaulted with the roasts, but balanced by the other flavors of more plum, coffee and caramel. And whats that? Hops? Sure enough. Plenty there once you start looking for it.

2005 bottle.  wonderful aroma of vanilla, dark fruit, some coffee, chocolate & caramel.  the look is very, very black with ruby highlights, especially in the lace as it chases its way down the side of my snifter.  upon the first sip or two a noticable hop bite is present, but after the third sip or so, everything smooths out.  flavor is big and bold with all of the aforementioned chocolate, coffee, vanilla, caramel & dark fruit.  in addition the hop bitterness and alcohol shows up in the tail end.  very enjoyable.  would think this would continue to improve over the next couple of years!  thanks rich for sending this one to me about 6 months ago.

Pours thick, opaque and almost pure black - reminiscent of well-used motor oil - and the faintest skin of a tan head that lingered and left some lacing.  The aromas are definitely not reminiscent of used motor oil, rather more like a roasty coffee, fudge with hints of soy sauce, dried prunes, figs and noticible alcohol.  The flavor profile is huge, lots of dark, bitter chocolate, espresso, prune juice, molasses and an astringent roasty finish.  Oh yeah, did I say noticible alcohol here as well?  Though its surprisingly well cloaked by the other flavors and sweetness.   Mouthfeel is thick, heavy and a bit oily, very smooth on the tongue.

Aroma of roasted dry grain, slight hint of metal and some alcohol. Very strong, bitter deep-roasted malt & bitter hops dominates the flavor. Not much sweetness at all, though a touch eventually shows up as it warms. Alcohol is well-hidden. Dry roast dominates lingering aftertaste. Slightly oily palate and tingly carbonation on the tongue.

Ultra dark brown-black color with the most creamy froth ever seen. The head is like a Sabalione made with the blachest expresso coffee you can imagine. The color of the foam is intens warm brown and the concistency is super creamy. Mega complex aroma, it is nobel sweetish, has touches of Irish Coffee (made with Blackbush), nice hints of sweet tar, burned caramel, the blackend crust of sweet raisin bread,  agorn sirup, corn-flowers, flower-pollen, cinnamon stick, burned edges of a hand made tarte tattin, crème brullée and fresh vanilla, cofit dorange black chocolate and loads of herbs like sage, laurell leaf, mint and an outstanding selection of hops.

First there is a sweet super concentrated coffee boost, then the creamy vanilla and fortified wine accenst are comming forward. Hints of Orange marmalade, Malaga wine and touches of a Dr Parcé Banyuls Hors dage are giving this beer a complex elegance. later the well integrated herbal touches brings some extra refreshment in this most exelent stout brew.

The 05 was good, but not nearly as intense an experience as the 04. Perhaps both the ageing and unfiltering made a difference. Regardless, my score is going up. Original Rating 8/8/05 Bottle 4/05 courtesy of Edward. The first time I sampled this was in a blind tasting during one of the Champaign-Urbana beer club meetings. I have to say I was impressed, but not at all overwhelmed. Ironically, of the Imperial Stouts we sampled that night, I found myself most drawn to the 2005 Founders.

1016,"2005-07-23",4.8,"Here it is.  Direct from the brewery and sitting in my 55 degree fridge for 3 months.  It is finaly time to sample the Dark Lord.  It pours a thick black with shimmers of deep red and a huge creamy brown head with tiny uniform bubbles which continue to emerge from the blackness, building an expanding head.  The aroma is sharp and powerful.  Chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts.  Smokey with a strong dark fruityness and a hint of alcohol.  Deep coffee and chocolate malts also bring with them an expected sweetness from a beer of this strength.  The malts flow effortlessly into a wonderful sharp citrus hop and both malt and hop linger in equal portions.  There is only a hint of alcohol, which is quite a task for a beer of this strength.  The feel is full bodied, both sweet and bitter and a stronger grapefruit hop feel and flavor emerges as it warms up.  Its amazing how clean and calm a beer of this size is.  It is neither overpowering with malt nor hop or for that matter alcohol.  Its tremendous that is is so calm yet has such great complexity at the same time.  Its hard to understand how such bold flavors can emerge, without any overpowering the others.  I was unsure what to expect because of the hype, but this beer is worth every penny and accolade that has been thrown upon it.  My highest rated beer yet.  Bravo Three Floyds.

1016,"2005-06-28",5.0,"Yep, yet another perfect rating for DL.  Ive tended to be skeptical of the hype that quite a few beers out there have but this one came through completely (unlike Westy 12). 
Bomber.  Poured into a snifter an absolutely opaque black with a massive dark chesnut head.  Just looking at the pour you knew the body was going to be incredible.  Aroma hit you with the molasses but not unfavorably so.  The nose progressed into coffee, chocolate and roasted malt with sweet caramel and toffee lingering around.  I got a bit of oakiness out of it though it may be from the vanilla that is used in this beer.  Flavor destroys your palate.  It had everything going on that was in the aroma, and yet a decent ester profile (cherries and dark dried fruits) managed its way through the massive roasted malt and chocolate and coffee flavor.  Hops were minimal in the flavor, but there was definitely adequate hop bitterness to balance this beast.  At 13%, I was surprised that the sweetness was fairly moderate, but given all that was going on in this beer, I guess everything was in correct balance. I got no alcohol in this at all though my sample size was small, Im sure I would have felt it more had I consumed the whole bomber, but in the flavor, none was found.  Mouthfeel was perfectly smooth with a complementing amount of carbonation.  Full bodied and syrupy, but far from sludgy as the previous years DL was described.  Wow....","Durham, North Carolina, USA","BlueDevil0206"
1016,"2005-06-27",5.0,"2005 Bomber.  Thanks to Oak for an awesome tasting.  This guy was involved in a three-way competition at a tasting I went to yesterday.  Dark Lord butted heads with Stone RIS and Alesmith Speedway and came out victorious.  The pour is opaque obsidian black.  I cant tell if there are any particulates or sediment in my glass at all simply because light cant penetrate far enough in to reflect off of them.  The head is almost as dark as the beer -- a deep sepia with some reverse-flow bubbling.  The carbonation pushed the center of the head up so much that the bubbles on the outside appeared to be flowing down.  Once the head dissipated (fairly quickly due to alcohol), I could get a better concept of the aroma.  It was initially dark, dried fruits -- cherries and raisins -- followed by an espresso smell melded with chocolate and roasted malts.  Hop profile is hard to get to, but theres something earthy going on.  Theres a little molasses there, too, but not overpoweringly so.  The palate was amazing.  It falls somewhere between heavy cream and crude oil.  Its viscous and thick, but not to the point that it sticks around too long after you swallow it.  The flavor is immense as well -- tons of roasted malt with a some coffee in the finish.  Exceptionally well balanced, maintaining its sweetness through the finish without becoming cloying.  Dried fruits are still there, but take on the roasty quality of the malt, unlike in the aroma.  Molasses and vanilla are much less notable than in the aroma, giving way to a chocolaty sweetness instead.  The finish is amazingly clean for as huge a beer as it is.  Simply mind-blowing.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Jonathan3584"

Poured an opaque black, thick, with a diminishing tan head which holds on the surface.

Chocolate, dark fruits, a small touch of roasted coffee, with a mild sweetness and a dry finish.  I cant really taste the alcohol, which surprises me.  Much more balanced than I expected.

1016,"2005-06-11",4.7,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2008 2005 Bottle @ The Map Room.  Poured a deep deep black with a syrupy consistency.  Low-profile, but powerfully dense brown head.  Aroma had just about everything good that you can put into a beer... coffee, molasses, roasted malts, dark fruits, alcohol.  Those flavors and more hit the palate with tremendous force.  Subtlety is not the Dark Lords style, and I would have been dissapointed if it hadnt been so thick.  Alcohol was well-subdued by the power of the other flavors... aside from a bit of a warming effect going down, and what happens when you decide to stand up again :)  Balance was very good.  Finish was long and full of coffee and a little bourbon.  2008 bottle thanks to David & Blake.  Poured thick, deeper black with a short creamy cap of deep tan head.

And finally, the fateful evening has arrived when I confidently enter the realm of the all-powerful Dark Lord.  Evil abounds in this eerie world, and in the distance, I hear his chilling snarl, but I am unafraid for he is surely no match for the mighty DarkElf!  I catch him dozing, and with amazing steath, I cockily attempt to open the bottle, but he quickly awakens and is not beaten easily.  The draping orange wax isnt wax at all, but a tough plastic shell that requires a meticulous battle plan to pry off the cap without destroying the orange seal.  But I eventually am victorious, vanquishing my haughty foe with unparalleled brilliance and skill.  I have won the opening skirmish, but apparently the war has just begun -- as I pour the beer, I can smell the alcohol before I even take a sip.  I make a feeble attempt to savor the nose, but with the alcoholic aroma calling me like the Sirens Song, impatience overcomes me as I rush into the next battle, taking my first sip, unprepared for the assault on my taste buds.  This is simply a massive, over the top beer in every respect.  In the Dark Lords lair, nothing is subtle.  Whatever I taste, I taste in great quantities.  Dark, bitter, burnt roastiness, chocolaty, with sweet cherries juxtaposed by a strong grapefruit hoppiness.  And oh, the cursed alcohol!  The tide has turned in this battle as Im beginning to feel a bit light headed after just a few sips.  I swing my sword, flailing wildly, missing my target as the Dark Lord taunts me with his deep, evil laugh.  Strong roast, chocolate, cherry and alcohol dominate the nose, the massive aromas extending his dominion.  Big, thick, rich, full bodied palate, somewhat syrupy, fully coating the mouth with a dense viscosity as thick as his breastplate.  Black-as-night color is as evil and sinister as the Dark Lord himself, as dark in color as his demonic shadow.  A touch of mahogany at the edges gives me some hope for victory, but with another sip, he silences me with a mighty roar.  Light brown head quickly fades to a moderate ring, but he is unphased by this minor weakness.  As I finish the glass (which is still only half the bottle), my senses are fogging.  I fear I am beaten.  Damn the Dark Lord, damn him to hell.  I bow before greatness.  He is Lord.  The mighty Dark Lord, my eternal master.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

1016,"2005-05-24",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 2, 2005 jimmack04 opened a bottle at the invitational, 2005 vintage.  pour was a jet black with a creamy tan colored head that faded down very nicely to some light lacing.  aroma is loaded with coffee and hints of chocolate and molasses.  the flavor was a little bit of a let down for me, as there was a lingering bitterness mixed in with tons of coffee, hints of vanilla, and a tail made up of molasses, bits of chocolate, and some hoppy tanginess. the abv comes out a bit toward the end of the mouthful, and i thought the body was a bit thin, compared to some of the other top shelf stouts i have had that have had the opportunity to age.  that would be my issue with this brew, dont get me wrong, it was excellent, but it felt too young...it needs to sit and age a bit to smooth out and achieve what i think is its full potential.  

rerate: drank an 04 bottle supplied by the ever generous BBB63,  much smoother, much thicker body.  great improvement  over time.  flavors were more or less the same, but the balance was so much better as the brew aged.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","richlikebeer"
1016,"2005-05-24",4.8,"Thanks to kmpitz2 for picking me up a case of this stuff. 2005 vintage. Cellar temperature. This beer pours a darkest of dark color with a tall and thick brown (mocha) head that has great retention and leaves tons of lacing on the glass. Very attractive and also a bit daunting. The aroma is all about coffee. Lots and lots of coffee/expresso. Maybe a slightest hint of alcohol, but minimal. Some slight chocolate in there as well, but mostly coffee. The flavor kicks you in the face. Strong presence of coffee and chocolate with hints of dark fruit and molasses. Big, big taste. The body is huge. Tons and tons of body, but it manages to avoid the oily syrup feel (which is great). Soooo thick. Awesome. Just awesome. The alcohol is very well hidden in this darkness. Drinkability is extremely good for 13% and they somehow avoid some of the drinkability problems that other large impy stouts have. Awesome brew.

2005.  Pours as it claims- like motor oil.  Aroma is a sweet rauchbier with hints of vanilla and cherry.  Okay, first sip of this highly cherished offering: Taste is a waterfall of flavor, with the smokiness at the apex of the formation, consisting of smoke and malted barley followed by a gradual widening of caramel and cherry.  Interesting.  This is obviously a very complex brew.  There are a myriad of flavors that contort themselves around a solid center of roasted nut.   As it warms, there are hints of raspberry in the finish, but it never loses its grip on the roasty/smoky flavor.  I swear there is an oak tree somewhere in this bottle.  The character in the finish is like a strong cup of coffee- bitter, biting, and thickly veiled.  The alcohol becomes much more prominent as this beverage warms.  Is it worth the hype?  In some instances, yes, it is.  Overall, I would rank this as a better than average Imperial Stout.  Definitely worth a try.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"
1016,"2005-05-20",4.8,"2005 bottle thanks to captaincougar!  holy holy crap.  this beer oozes out of the bottle leaving a small electric-brown head.  i think the room got a little darker when i poured this--light cannot escape the black hole that my glass has become.  aroma is milder than i expected but still rich with chocolate, woody tannins, alcohol, even a touch of sweet vanilla and honey.  before you can even taste it, the liquid spreads itself over your entire mouth like some sort of sentient cough syrup--then once your tastebuds are surrounded, theyre assaulted with more chocolate, oak, coffee, sugar, alcohol, some hop bitterness hidden deep away.  the finish is....hmm.  there isnt really a finish.  it kicks your mouth in the ass for as long as it can, and then it kicks you some more.  good god i wish i could drink this more often!","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
1016,"2005-05-20",4.3,"A big big one for number 50.  Blacker than black, not an overpowering aroma, but nice.  Suprisingly smooth, reminds me of Expedition without the bitter and harsh finish to it.

1016,"2005-05-17",4.5,"I was luck and got two bottles at Jungle Jims in Cincinnati. Black hue with small dark brown head. Aroma was a complex heavy combo of molasses, chocolate and coffee. Full creamy body. Flavor was as complex of heavy sweet and a long solid finish. Clearly has earned this high rating and I am looking forward to bottle two.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1016,"2005-05-14",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 4, 2007 Rerate.  I let this bottle sit in my fridge for 8 months.  It didnt quite taste like the first time.  It seemed more mellow.  Strong coffee and smokiness.  I couldnt really tell any difference between this and an Expedition stout.  Both are excellent.  This one is just a rip off.

Finally, after 3 years of waiting I got my hands on this and, story of my life, it didnt live up to all the hype.  Its good, but no different than any other imperial stout.  Black as coal with a strange brown head.  Thick as molasses.   Overwhelming scent of coffee, and flavor is skewed most specifically to coffee.  Doesnt really taste like a beer, more like a coffee milkshake.  $16 a bomber is probably the biggest scam Ive ever experienced.  Dont waste your time trying to find this.  Id rather have an Alpha King.  RERATE. had it on cask and it just tasted like alcohol and coffee. together they tasted like apple juice.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"
1016,"2005-05-14",4.7,"highly sought after, much anticipated.  this surely lives up to all the hype.  worth every penny.  this was one viscous beer.  poured a thick black with an impressive brown head.  while the aroma was inviting, it wasnt all that special and did not justice to the taste, so at first sip i was pleasantly smacked over the head with flavor, not to mention a chewy mouthful of this imperial coffee stout.  the strong bitter black coffee flavor played off of the multitute of other flavors in this perfectly.  this could be sipped or gulped, was both delicate and and way over the top at the same time.  i am really glad that i got to try this.  it is difficult to imagine a better beer than this.","Saint Louis, Missouri, USA","SkyinBrian"
1016,"2005-05-14",4.9,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2011 So, after a year of being here, Dark Lord is released again. We didnt make it to the brewery, but we found it at the Binnys in Hyde Park. Damn glad that we did. Pours a syrup black. Looks like maple syrup with a fluffy brown head. So pretty. I sat smelling it for a while, as it was a little overchilled. Smell had coffee, hairspray, molasses. Actually, the aroma detracted a little bit. I was nowhere near ready for what was next. I took a sip and was taken aback. It was thick, like when an inkpen explodes in your mouth. Easily the thickest beer Ive ever had. Id probably equate it to chocolate syrup. Taste is amazing as well. Lots of coffee, sweetness, molasses. Seems like the only bittering agent in this beer is coffee and it works wonders. Theres so much going on. This is my new favorite.

Had the 2006 batch after the release in 2006, much more muted...

2005 had on 5/10/8:  couple years have turned this into a new beer, equally as good and confirming that I wasnt naive when I first had it. Strong and thick, the hops have mellowed out and brought forth more roast. Still amazing and could handle the time like it aint no thing.

2008 had on 5/9/8: This was different than the 2005. Lots of fruitiness in the nose, peaches and such. Minimal coffee character and reasonably sweet. Of note, there was about 5oz of sludge in the bottom of the bottle that afforded a ton of hop character and roastiness and more astringency than the decanted portion. Awesome awesome beer...

2011 Edition-12/20/11. Bigger and sweeter, not as big of a body as it used to have. More nutmeg notes come through but dry out with roast. Really quite sweet. Will be interested to see how this one ages...","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"

Strong notes of rhubarb and strawberry laced dark chocolate and coffee.  The palate is the first thing that hits.  Rich and full bodied, creamy, pudding.  Holy cow!  Back to the 2004 quality.  The flavor is chocolate, rich and fully complex.  Coffee, yeasty pudding, chocolate, light rhubarb. 9, 5, 9, 5, 18 = 4.6
Chuck opened one to share on a condition that I share one of mine with him.  Thanks Chuck!  First of all, if the appearance could be a 6, thatd be fine by me.  Thick, permanent brown head thats like chocolate mousse atop a thick motor oil black body.  We wonder what candlepower would be necessary to shine through this.  The aroma is chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malts, molasses.  The flavor is very roasted.  Coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa powder, espresso, grass hops hide under the big malts.  The palate is ultra thick, lingering, alcohol, good carbonation. 9/5/8/4/18 = 4.4

Resampled on 8/20/05 with my brother.  I upped the flavor 1 notch.  Also, the alcohol is covered up a bit more than when first sampled. 9/5/9/4/18 = 4.5

Sampled a 2004 red-waxed bottle per Todd, the non rater beer guy.  THANKS!  This version is MUCH better.  Although, the scores are very similar, its so different and MUCH, MUCH better.  FFF, bring back the original version!  The beer has a full mouthfeel and is VERY thick and viscous.  I even drank the sediment it was so good.  The beer has a gorgeous head atop a dark black body.  It is a tan/dark brown head with excellent retention and lacing, even in the 30+ oz challis we poured it into.  The flavor is the richest, maltiest, most chocolate laced beer ever.  The palate is VERY viscous and coating.  Better and more mellow than the 2005 version. I did dock a point on the aroma, but that was likely due to the glass size. 8/5/10/5/18 = 4.6","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"

Black ink spills forth, pouring slightly thinner than previous vintages and cascading into the snifter with muddy edges and a sparsely populated, dark tan sawdust head.  Aroma ejects outright evil matter.  Chocolate port, scorched anise, plum pudding caramelized to the cusp of cinder, blackberry puree with dark chocolate seeping into the porous matter, and boozy blackened caramel.  Pervasive oil seeps in, planting flavors of stark espresso with a profoundly rich French pressed bitterness.  Black currant, meet blackberry jam.  Now dance.  Oozing black plums in a boozed out pool of melted Ghirardelli squares, Irish cream and Godiva liquor.  Dark chocolate fornicates with liquidized turtle candies - what once was chunky chocolates is now a thick, steady stream.  Oily weight and triple batched espresso transcend mouth feelings and flavors.  Black patent tangos with coffee and overcompensates slightly, but its ""black"" thats the foundational treatise of the beer and you cant alter that rebellious nature.  Flame licked plum sauce captures the finish on scorched crème brûlée, oozing down the tongue flanks in its final hour.

2005 bomber, consumed May 2005.Thickest pour known to man.  A deep, dark, impenetrable mass.  Heavy, dense, formidable lacing on the sides of the snifter, worthy of its own exhibit at the Louvre.  Aroma is molasses, cherries, burnt rubber, mocha and blackberry jam.  Robust and full-bodied in flavor.  Vibrant coffee strikes fast and hard, then transitions to a deliciously roasted chocolate covered espresso bean.  Strikingly bitter.  Everything is in perfect harmony.  Life is really f*ckin good right now.  Coats the palate like wax, with a little spiciness trapped underneath that glossy layer.  Great, dense, heavy.  Nectar of the gods.  Cant taste the ABV but youre feeling pretty good early on.  Finish is roasted, no, charred almonds.  By all means, one of the finest beers Ive ever had.

How often do you get a Dark Lord on one of your first trades? Anyway. This is an impressive bottle. You all see the picture of it, with the melted red wax and the elaborate artwork. I have a 44 minute version of the Allman Bros Mountain Jam on in the background.  Anyway, now on to the beer. The starting temp is 53.2°, which is a bit cold, but over the course of the 22oz bottle, it should warm up quite a bit. Served in my NB worthy glass. Pours dark black with a mocha colored head. The beer is a mouthful, it about as full as a beer can get.  No sediment. The aroma is already wafting my way. When I stick my nose into the glass, it is a roasted malt, vanilla, coffee, spicy hops. There doesnt seem to be a bunch of carbonation getting in the way in the mouth, just mouth coating malty goodness. The flavor is sweet malt with a touch of molasses, a spicy, hoppy middle, and a light coffee finish. I let the beer warm up to ~59°. The aroma smells just like a barrel aged beer, vanilla and almost a bourbon aroma, with a bit of the alcohol lurking in the background. The taste is sweet and malty with dark fruit notes (prunes, raisins); the hops kick in a bit, as does the alcohol, but the malt wins out. I thought the hops would come out more as the beer warms, but they did not seem to. My second pour seems fine, but I think there might be a bit of sediment in it; if so it is a fine sediment and just makes it a bit more ""full."" The second to last pour was like brown cream, the taste was bitter and harsh. I a filtering the last 1/4 of the beer with a paper towel since I cant find a coffee filter. I wont rate the last 1/3 of the bottle, because if left unfiltered, it is horrible.
 
2005 Bottle. Like the 04 it has better than a year of cellaring time before drinking. The beer is black, not nearly black or black with red tints, but black as  black can be. The beer leaves a gleaming bit if itself on the glass as drank. A small cocoa colored head rings above. The beer is not overly cold, but the aroma is weak, smelling of roast and blackstrap molasses and some earthy and citrusy hops. The taste is chocolate milk, mild roast, some earthy hops some citrus on the backend. The mouthfeel is insane, on par with Expedition.

1016,"2005-01-05",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 22, 2008 much thanks to enniskillen for this brew!!!!after much anticipation,i get to be in the presence of the dark lord.we sat his majesty in my snifter glassand he poured out just like used motor oil.i even got a bit of a dark brown head with mine.i put the glass to my nose and the dark lord gave me a complex blend of cherries,beef jerkey,roasted malts,and coffee.now its time for the first sip.i was so excited even the butterflies in my stomach were thirsty......
WOW!the major thing i noticed was that the palate changed for over 10 seconds,and then left a coating in my mouth untll the next sip.cherries,blackend malts,coffe,smoke,toffee,and a bit of alcohol rounded out the palate.(if i could give the palate a 10,i would.)
my eyes were lit up,my palate was exhuasted,and my teeth were coated.if i could describe this beer in one word,it would be......BLACK!                                  
2005 BOTTLE RATED ON JAN. 1 2006....
poured black as night with a small brown head.aroma was a mix of cookies,roasted malts,coffee and alcohol.flavor was a complex mix of brownies,cookies,coffee,chocolate,and alcohol.mouthfeel was super thick and the palte was amazing.COMMENTS AFTER THE BOTTLE WAS FINISHED ON JAN. 1 2006.i was happy that this bottle had no sludge as the 2004 did.although i liked the flavor of the 2004 a bit better.the 2005 was more bitter and i could not detect the molasses in this years batch.mouthfeel was a little lighter as well.
2006 BOTTLE RATED ON JULY 5TH.BY WAY OF 1FASTSTI:again the body was super black with a very small dark brown head.aroma was a nice mix of chocolate brownies,brown sugar,molasses,and maybe a hint of coffee?the flavor came on a rush of over ten seconds and really changed over this period.chocolate,coffee,brownies,figs,raisons,purp grapes,and a tiny alcohol finish all sent my tounge into a tailspin.the mouthfeel was super thick and as i said,the palate was awsome.although after a few sips it did get a little sweet,and the alcohol became a little overbearing.id say the 2005 is a little better than the 2006. i think the 06 could use some aging.(2007 BOTTLE SAMPLED ON SEPT. 03 2007)as usual its black as black can be.although i didnt get much head from this years batch.the aroma is sweet and sticky dark fruits,roasted malts,smoke,and dark chocolate.the flavor is even more complex than the aroma.i get dark fruits,coffee,chocolate,molasses,smores,smoke,roa malts,slightly lighter fruits like green apples,brown sugar,etc.its so complex its hard to really pick out everything.although at the same time it seems likes it a bit smoother than the 06 or 05.this ranks right up with the 04 version for sure.well once again as i sip on this it just becomes to sweet.im gonna cork up the bottle and try and drink the rest tomorrow.(2008 BOTTLE RATED ON 5-22-08)thick,black,and nasty in appearance.(as expected.)small dark brown head with some legs on her.the aroma is roasted malts,dark fruit,alcohol,coffee,molasses,chocolate,and metal.the flavor is much of the same with the sweetness from the molasses really sticking out.pretty damn good stuff,but still a bit over-hyped.(re-rate)well im about halfway through the 08 bottle and as with the others.its just getting to sticky sweet.i think the rating needs to be lowered again.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Odeed"
1016,"2005-01-01",4.6,"The highly anticipated EVIL ONE himself.  Thanks jimmack04 for this ""suprise"".  After trying subtley to lure me to his house after he traded this from EddieG(i thank him as well), i sensed something was up and searched around ratebeer only to piece the clues together and foil the suprise.  I asked jim on the phone if he got hold of a DARK LORD,and he admitted the truth. From then until the time i arrived at his house there was a permanently fixed smile of anticipation on my face.  
    Ok, while chewing my way through this monstrosity of a beer, i have to say that its not just a good beer.  It is an amazing beer experience.  Aroma first hits me as some soy, then sweet. Nothing special, im a bit worried.  Then i take a sip.  Milk chocolate, dark chocolate, bitersweet chocolate, mollasses, figs, cherries, vanilla.  Obviously it is the palate that really makes this special.  Milkshake like consistency.  Coats my tongue, throat, tonsils, TEETH. Custardy.  Probobly could not finish a bottle myself without a stomach ache.  But if i had the chance id probobly try.  Awesome experience.  Needed a nap after this one.","bayonne, New Jersey, USA","joeec5"

As intriguing as the aroma and flavors are, the most incredible thing about this beer is the body. It is thicker and richer than I could have imagined. It coats your mouth, tongue and throat like Pepto Bismol, albeit extremely delicious Pepto!

1016,"2004-12-06",3.1,"To be totally honest, I was overly excited to try this beer.  When I got that red wax sealed cap off the smell immediately said ""wow,"" this might be great.  The appearence was jet black; thicker than any other beer I have ever seen and with more sediment than I had ever seen in a beer.  The flavor was good, but the beer was just too thick and the deep layer of sludge at the bottom of the bottle adds to the grittiness/thickness of the mouthfeel.  The finish actually made me craze something thinner to wash the beer down as this beer was literally like drinking motor oil with it thickness.  From other reviews, I can respect this beer, but it doesnt suit me in that sense.  Rather, I am very glad I was able to experience it, but not know that hype sometimes has alot to do with ratings rather than honest, unbiased reviews.  Give it try, maybe your review will be better than mine.","Pennsylvania, USA","Prostman"
1016,"2004-12-03",4.8,"This came in a menacing looking 22oz bomber that was dipped in red wax to give the appearance of being sealed in blood. A cartoon picture of the dark lord is on the label as well to add to the overall Dark Lord theme. Looking like the used oil at jiffy lube this stuff pours out as thick as I have ever seen. It is pitch black almost verging on sucking in all surrounding. The head starts impressively before falling into a cap of bubbles and leaving not lacing but a film over any portion of the glass that it comes in contact with. Aroma is of chocolate covered berries, molasses and roasted malts. The flavor is tremendous standing out much more than the scent with chocolate, roasted coffee and dark fruits blending for a complex palette experience. A slight coffee bitter aftertaste is also present as well as a slightly sour taste as it warmed. Mouthfeel is ridiculous I have had nothing as thick as this ever and it is amazing. It coats the entire mouth and sits heavy on the tongue, very nice. Drinkability is also excellent there is no sign of the 13% anywhere in this monster. The thickness is the only thing that slowed me down while drinking it. Impressive in all ways I highly recommend this to anyone, hopefully I can come across more bottles of this in the future.","Sterling, Virginia, USA","meathookjones"

1016,"2004-11-30",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 22, 2005 Original Rating (2004 vintage, 8-3-10-4-18=4.4): Subtle and complex aroma emerges more and more as it warms - vanila, chocolate, floral hops, sweet, malty, fruity, nutty, mildly roasty... Opaque, dark brown and still, heavy, dark and viscous with nice legs that coat the glass but no head whatsoever. Sweet honey, molasses and marzipan flavours with subtle insinuations of orange-pine-grapefruit citrus hops. Alternates back and forth between sweetness and intense roasted malts. Thick, syrupy body is just shy of being cloying. Alcohol never apparent - this Dark Lord has nice manners. Certainly a beer to be shared, abeer to be contemplated, a beer to be enjoyed, respected and even celebrated. Bottle enjoyed with beerbuzzmontreal, Lubiere, MartinT, Rastacouere and SimonB.Rerate (2005 vintage, 7-4-7-4-14=3.6): Very roasty aroma with green, leafy hops.  Alcohol is very present.  Opaque dark brown with deep brown head that recedes to a lasting cover.  Linear flavour is sweet up front followed by a big roasted malt character that leaves a lasting bitterness in the mouth.  Bitterness seems to obscure any chocolate, malt, or fruity character.  Thick, rich mouthfeel is very sticky and syrupy in texture woth no carbonation.

1016,"2004-11-30",4.4,"Pours a pitch black color with no head. The first thing that surprises me about this beer is the low intensity aroma, I tought I would have huge roasted malts in the nostrils but all I could detect was some alcohol, a bit of a deception but other elements will largely make up for it. Powerfull, mind blowing flavor of roasted malt ,alcohol, hops and a sweetness I cant put my finger on. That was nice, then the palate, oh my god !! this beer has a huge, humongous, monstrous body, with a viscous motor oil-like texture and soft carbonation. There is only one word to describe this beer : cochon (Tm MartinT) !!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
1016,"2004-11-28",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 30, 2005 No sludge bottle. No head to cover this tar black oil body. Who cares about head anyway, lets not bother with such futile details. Restrained aroma, hypothesis that the huge body keeps it from expressing, but its still lacking in the department. You have to fight to get a not so exciting vinous alcohol nose, though you would never expect 13%. Slight fruity hints when warming, mild cocoa, even milder roastiness. Who cares about aroma anyway? Lets not bother with such futile details. There it comes, the palate baby, the mouthfeel! Heavy, oily, thicker than syrup, fuller than 35% cream, neglectable carbo is just fitting perfectly with that beast. Chocolate cream. Easily the thickest beer in the universe as I imagine it. Taste comprises of extreme molasses. Big honey/maple sweetness. Excessive sweetness in fact, this never aimed to be balance and it isnt. It remains rather sustained and with nice subtle nuance for a 13% beer with no in your face flavours, it just wants to be heavy. Well contained hoppiness (flower, herbs, grapefruit), chocolatey. It doesnt taste fully fermented ultimately, but again, this has to be an effect from the mouthfeel. It just tastes incredibly sweet and without much of the fruitiness Id like in an impy. Cloying finish, unique. 1 yr certainly did it good because as it is now, it tastes like malt syrup mixed with molasses. Extremely challenging and pleasant beer to try, but in small quantities. A beer to share, a beer to be scared of, a beer to admire. Congratz to the people at FFF for their adventurous nature and thanks to raindog (what happened to him?) for the bottle.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

1016,"2004-11-23",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 31, 2007 Score is for most recent vintage (2007)2004 release bottle @ the DC/MD/VA/WV Gathering courtesy of Mike (eyedrinkale), and subsequent botltes from my cellar.  What a generous contribution!  Id like to first note that I tried a sample from near the top of the bottle; no sludge and also tried and drank the entire glass of sludge from the second to last pour from the bottle.  I dont know why everyone is whining so much about the sludge, its actually quite tastey.  Thick and pudding like (but more grit than pudding) it still retains a great flavor.  Anyways, Ill let up on my analysis of the sludge and talk about the non-sludged sample.  Right away, I realized, this is the thickest, chewiest, biggest, just altogether high gravity beer Ive sampled.  The palate is chewy, sticky and just pure flavorful stout goodness.  Its not over the top with the coffee.  It reminds me of the Flossmoor Eclipse, though a much amped up version.  Wine, port, rich soy and maple notes on the nose.  Vanilla, chocolate, spanish coffee flavors, with rich malt accents all throughout.  Such an even, smooth palate.  With all of the stuff going on here, theres little time to take note of the high alchol content.  I dont see how you could rate the flavor below a 9, but to each his/her own.  Incredible dark black/brown pour, with a rich dark tan head.  This stuff just drips with quality and care of brewing.  What really blew me away, was that for a brew of this magnitude, there was still plenty of stout character; it wasnt just all roast, alcohol and sugar.  I can honestly say, I dont know what more I could ask for from this beer. 10/5/10/5/202005 release bottle  Still a phenomenal treat and a splendor to behold in the glass, with a thick, coating presence, leaving legs and residue, and a pitch black appearance,  BUT, not anywhere near as unfiltered as last years.  In my mind, the mouthfeel, the oh so glorious mouthfeel! of the 2004 was worth the fact that it came at the cost of losing 25% of the bottle to sludge.  This one is very bitter and hoppy, but I am impressed, its not too hoppy even this young.  Aroma is not quite as overpowering, but still quite lovely, lots of choco-vanilla, fudge, bourbon, wood, roast, ok so it is quite good!  Give me the 04 though!  8/4/8/4/152006 release bottle drunk in August 06.  Heavily hoppy in the nose, with less finesse and sumptuous, velvety malt perceived in the background.  Seems rather fuselic and prematurely racked/filtered.  Still has a flavorful chocolate and nice tar/ashiness that balances well the sweet, but still fairly well-attenuated malts.  But the finish crackles with burnt rubber, stale popcorn and green apples.  What the hell is that all about?  Did they brew it in too large a batch and at too high a temperature to get better attenuation on a larger batch?  I dont know, but the fact remains that it has some obvious flaws.  And for flaws to break through in DarkLord means some serious problems.  Typical filtered texture is nothing like 2004.  7/4/7/3/13.Rating is an average of the 3 versions minus a point because its grown worse not better.2007 bottle consumed fresh in July 07Really, really nice to see that they didnt filter this to high hell.  Much better head retention with appropriate lacing/residue left behind.  Its certainly no 04, and theres no visible sediment, but its also not crystal clear.Nice, deep, flawless nose is full of bitter, resinous hops balanced by bitter, dark roast and coffee, but buttressed by sweet vanilla, loads of sweet chocolate and light caramel.  Gooey at times, but dry at others.Intense coffee and black malt immediately pulverize the palate with bitterness and oodles of flavor.  Char, very light vinousness and black licorice all slowly give way to light choco-caramel malts, with a full, round, surprisingly soft texture.  Again, its not the 2004, which I had side-by-side with this bottle, but its definitely far and away better than both the previous releases.  Obviously aggressive, but its very young.  This should mellow out nicely in the next year or two.  Mostly tight, low carbonation and no fusels/flaws.  Great, and very satisfying.  8/5/9/4/17","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Rating # 600
DL was cellared with anticipation of a somewhat eventful moment. Upright and in the dark depth of my beer closet this beer sat for 10 months. What the hell was going on in that bottle during this time?
 Major kudos too Nick Floyd for brewing up such a novel and extreme creation! 
As I poured the first glass I could see the density of this beers body. Motor oil thick,10W 40 thick! Black as the far side of the moon, motionless as death thick as Jennifer Lopezs sexy ass!   The nose and tongue are ripe with dark pitted fruits. Plums, dates, figs, prunes, then raisins, then brown sugar smoky notes of molasses, sweetness. whooooo sweetness, cloying? Sweetened.. Super Sweetened espresso.. Espresso Supreme! Where is all this vanilla coming from? Charred ash.. who was cremated to forge this brew?  The second glass was far more tart than the first, somewhat gritty. 
 Was I just drinking some jet black liquid led? This beer weighs in at infinity per liquid ounce. Thats 22 x infinity? It was simply too thick too viscous too syrupy too extreme too over the top for any type of consistent drinking. One 22oz bottle, in which I only concurred 17 ounces of liquid, took me 3 hours a 3 hour pint +1 of vice and sin The beer is the blood of Satan.. Nick Floyd murdered Satan and bottled this, his essence How he did this? I could never tell you but he managed!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

And yet theres sweetness under all that tarry thing - dark fruitlike (what else?). SUPERB balance. Totally tarry texture, beyond viscous. WOW! this makes ""great"" - or ""big"" - sound silly.

1016,"2004-10-03",5.0,"UPDATED: JUN 7, 2008 Multiple bottles, multiple vintages.  Finally prepared to give this beer a 5.0.  The beer has a consistency and thickness like no other beer in the world.  Flavors of black cherry, espresso and chocolate.  Intense and incredibly flavorful.  I will say, its not a 5.0 fresh, but is after some time in the bottle.  Its a very special beer, a showcase of brewing skill.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"

1016,"2004-09-14",4.9,"A BIG #100 here.  This beer was so.... well pretty much so big.   One of the best beers ive ever had, maybe the best ever.  but with its limited availability, id prefer to keep my favorite as somthing i can appreciate on a regular basis.   But anyway on with the review,  aroma was full of so much.   Dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, malts,  among others.    Tastes was similar but loaded with more alcohol.  Was very thick beer, but did not have the previously mentioned ""sludge"" from other ratings.   Overall an excellent brew, full of so much goodness that it will leave an everlasting impression on almost anyone who gets the chance to taste it.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","Dough77"
1016,"2004-09-12",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2006 #700, huge thanks to cb!  This is the tale of two beers, the beautiful, intricate, thick and complex imperial stout that composed the first 2/3 of the bottle, and the hop dregs sludge that greeted me at the end of the bottle.  Initial appearance was of motor oil blackness, with a head struggling to make its way through the beer.  The middle pour actually revealed a decent but quickly fading dark brown, compact head.  I wont deal with the last pour yet.  Aroma was warming alcohol, with chocolate, mocha, dark cherries, faint pine, and port.  The flavor matched, gaining in complexity.  Thick, complicated, a sipper for sure, but a truly excellent and enjoyable beer.  Im thinking in the upper 4s for the rating.  Then came the last 1/3 of the bottle.  It sort of coughed its way out, almost with the same consistency as A1.  The aroma abruptly turned into pure hop resin.  Ever homebrewed?  Have you ever poured off the wort, leaving behind the spent hop pellets, but then accidentally leaving it on the stove so it burned a bit?  That is what this smelled like.  Literal dregs.  My glass has chunks hanging off the brown coating on the side of it.  The flavor unfortunately matched, except someone took the spent yeast off the bottom of the fermenter and chucked that in for some extra body.  I literally couldnt drink it.  So now I have had one of the best and worst beer experiences in my life out of the same bottle.  A bizzare, memorable #700.  My ratings will be slanted towards the first half of the bottle.  I guess its kind of like bumping into the real Dark Lord.  Mysterious and darkly seductive at  first, but then it all just goes to hell.  Im tempted to cut the last bit of this with a High Life just to see what hapens.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
1016,"2004-09-10",4.9,"The pouring out of this beast is incredible, especially the last half of the bomber where it gets all thick and gooey, and boy does it ever. Super sludgy and slow, reminds me of a melted fudgesicle thickness, color too is fudgy. Sits in the glass like black tar but keeps an overall dark fudge brown cask to its depth. A thin but thickly set super spongy tan head lays on top for a good while before it murks its way off the glass while sipping. A thin fluffy collar remains and the lacing is in webby strings along with an oily residue coating over every inch the liquid has touched. This liquid has a life of its own beyond its other attributes of smell, taste, and feel. Take a look at your glass when your done, youll know what I mean.

Aroma has a nice soothing chocolate underlay where tossed apricot, dark cherry, molasses, and dates swirl around with dark juicy esters of spicy alcoholic warmth. Cleans the senses out pretty quickly.

Taste is thick, thick, thick, chunky even, you notice the massive mouthfeel right away. Flavors are ridiculously rich to go with it, loads of dark chocolate laced with nearly every dark fruit imaginable with a rich tangy molasses coating it all and some fine bittering of fresh hop cones and chocolate with touches of coffee beans at the finish. Slivers of alcohol has little hints to boubon barrel oakyness, smokey peet, and port to it along the way through to the finish as well. Boastfully terrific!

Feel is massively thick, beyond the reach of words here with this stuff. Syrupy, thickly creamy, mega lush, richly full bodied beyond the threshold of any other Imperial Stout I have undertaken. Oily leftovers on the lips, like chapstick. Oh my...Wonderfully thick!

At first I began to drink this down like it was nothing, but by half glass I gave up even thinking I could drink the whole thing by myself. Its like pie filling! Oh, but it is yummy pie filling...yummy. The thickness slowed me down therefore hampered the drinkability a bit for me. Still is very drinkable in a slow mannered kinda way. Respectfully. Great stuff!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
1016,"2004-09-06",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2005 5/3/05: Footbalm hooked me up again. He brought me back a bottle from the release party last Friday. Had it tonight with a buddy. It was awesome. Hoppier than I remember. And, did not have any standing sediment like previous vintages. Incredible. 10/30/04 Re-rate - RBMNG. Footbalm was gracious enough to bring a bottle of this to our recent Ratebeer Minnesota gathering. We poured about 2/3 of the bottle into a carafe until we got to the sediment. We then poured the sediment into a paper funnel to let the beer soak through. After about an hour, we had another 10 or so ounces more of the good beer. Dark chocolate aroma with bourbon notes and red wine tannins. Fully opaque. Small, brown head. Beautiful flavor. Very complex; plums, black currant. Thick and syrupy mouthfeel. Somewhat hoppy. A joy to drink in moderation. Eagerly awaiting the bottle Nick Floyd promised to send me which I promise to share. 9/6/04 - 2004 GTM. Nic Floyd gave me and my buddy most of his sample since Three Floyds ran out of their Dark Lord about 45 minutes before they were even scheduled to pour it at the 04 Great Taste of the Midwest. Dark chocolate aroma. Brown head. Large floaty particalia. Moutfeel is of residual chocolate on the tongue. Like they melted bars of dark chocolate into the brew and the residue floats in the beer. Unrefined, but tasty. Would like my own bottle of the stuff at some point unless I choose to boycott it due to 3Fs poor handling of their GTM beer distribution for the 2nd year in a row.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
1016,"2004-09-04",4.0,"Would have loved to have this one as #300 for me, but alas I could wait no longer.  Poured like motor oil - thick, with virtually no head.  The glass was coated with malt as I drank it.  Aroma-wise, the potency starts there.  Alcohol is evident, with some bourbon and hops.  Body - like Warren Sapp - thick and black.  The malt must have come from maple trees, as this is fully a syrup - barely liquid.  Flavor is mostly vanilla and mocha.  This beer is just over the top, and in my book - (slightly)overrated.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","skaughty"
1016,"2004-08-29",4.2,"8/11/04.  Poured out of 22 oz. bottle, obtained in a trade with JCapriotti on RateBeer 5/14/04.  Pours a thick dark black-brown, oily and viscous with almost complete opacity.  Head is slight and uneven, a bright, sandy gold-tan.  Lacing is decently sandy and shimmering but very spotty.  And theres a different kind of lacing at work here-- this beer is so thick, it coats the sides of the glass not with carbonation bubbles, but with syrupy soy sauce-looking residue of the beer (a friend finished his glass and then filled it up with water to rinse it out, and the water turned a dark golden-brown color that is probably darker and still more flavorful than any macro swill!).  Very impressive, but I would have loved more head on the monster.  Aroma has an amazing hop richness, dark sugar and sort of a chocolatey presence, but theres not a whole lot of dark roast, burnt, or toasted malts.  Its nice, but it mostly just prepares for the big, rich sugary sweetness.  Flavor has licorice, chocolate, and the rich dark sugar.  A bit too one-dimensional in its dark sugary sweetness.  Body is incredibly full, chunky and chewy.  You can literally feel the grainy particles as you drink it, and it of course gets more and more obscene as you work your way down through the sludge.  Finish is long and chocolatey, hoppy as well.  Sort of a strange combination.  Very rich and unbelieveably big, full finish.  Probably the most decadent beer Ive ever had (Id hate to see how many calories are in one bottle of this stuff!), but not close to one of the best.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"
1016,"2004-08-28",5.0,"#1,000!!!!!!!.. HUGE thank you to BBB63 for this one, and I know hes gonna love my review!  Wow, its great to get to 1,000, and I picked the perfect beer for this occasion.  The beer pours dark black with slight ruby around the edges.  The aroma is behemoth, with tons of dark malt, chocoff, black licorice, sherry, slight soy sauce, and fine cognac.  The taste.......whoa Nelly let me tell ya bout the taste!  Super rich on the tongue, with tons of malt, chocoff, dark fruit, black licorice.  Very sweet, full-bodied, and complex.  When I first tasted this, I said ""Holy shit!"".  This ones flavor and palate is on par with DFH Worldwide Stout.  The palate is the richest, thickest, and firmest of any beer Ive ever had.  I take nothing away from the great stouts, among them Stone RIS, Bells Expedition, Central Waters BBS, and Great Divide Yeti among my favorites, but the flavor here is an entire new level....a level I previously thought unapproachable.  The alcohol is very well hidden.  As for the ""sludge"", Ive poured very carefully, am about halfway through my bomber, and Im telling everyone that I will gladly drink the sludge and ask for more.

It lacked the powerful dark roasted malts, and strong coffee flavors I have come to expect in many of the big imperial stouts.  Instead, it featured the complex fruits.

1016,"2004-08-11",4.7,"What everyone else says!!  I have nothing more to add on positives.  This beer is un-fin-real!!  Ill take my comments a different route here though.  My complaint (on the second half of the bottle)  was that the sludge absolutely ruined the last several ounces.  I cant believe Ill admit to this, but I poured at least the last 6 ozs down the drain.  Just couldnt handle it.  The sludge just took it to another level of thick bitter mud which I couldnt stomach.  I knew about it, but continued to pour it into my snifter anyway.  Big mistake.  I understand bottle conditioning, etc, but why such thick yeast??  I always pour the yeasties in, but I just cant understand what happened here.  Anyway, it was still a tremendous beer prior to that point.  Thanks TAR from many many months ago for the trade.

Strong chocolate and coffee blended with more licorice and vanilla. Taste of molasses and brown sugar. HUGE rich flavors here! There is some strong hints of alcohol as well. The mouthfeel is as thick and chewy as a beer can be. I dont think I could have possibly guessed it to be this thick and muddy. Some slight alcohol burn going on but its a nice warming feel. Its like drinking watered down alcoholic pudding. Bit on the oily side as well. Finish is bittersweet with dark chocolate and more molasses and coffee. This is a huge beer.

A wonderful chocolate, coffee, and smoke aroma. The flavor was quite sweet with chocolate, raisins, coffee, toffee, and licorice. There was some sour fruit detectable in the background. The alcohol was not that noticeable for 13% ABV. It was certainly a pleasure to be able to finally sample this beer and I would definitely like to try more in the future.

1016,"2004-07-11",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 14, 2008 (2005 bottle)Pitch black hue with a dense, creamy, mostly lasting, dark brown head.  The Dark Lord clings to the sides of my glass attempting to escape his near certain doom by ingestion.  Aroma is heavily malty consisting of roasted grains, molasses, toffee, bakers dark chocolate, and dark roast coffee.    Also present are notes of sprucey hops, light alcohol (rum), dates, tawny port, and charcoal.  Grand, but not as much oomph as I rember the previous version having.  Heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter flavor becommes a moderate to heavily sweet, moderately acidic, heavily bitter finish with a slight alcohol burn.  Seemingly much more acidic, roasty and bitter than last years version.  The smoothness has been replaced with robustness.  Incredibly thick body, oily/sticky texture, soft carbonation.  The bottom line is: maybe my impression of last years DL was a fluke.  While this is still damn good, its no five.

(2004 bottle)What an excellent suprise to see this one sitting on the table!  Chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, caramel malt (H); oak, whisky, alcohol, vanilla, toffee, etc.  Black hole body, deep brown head.

No hop aroma or flavor detected and very little roast malt as well.

Bottle sample from Eyedrinkale at Brewtopia. Deep Dark brown, tan head. Awesome aroma of sweet malt, fresh wort, and hops, and maybe some maple syrup.  Flavor reminds me of hopped malt extract. Not what I was expecting at all. Doesnt even seem like a finished beer. Massive sweet hops.

1016,"2004-06-16",5.0,"This beer was sampled and shared with Beerguy101, thanks again mitch! This is the first beer I can proudly say IS perfect! This was like dessert in a bottle. It pours a liquid sludge, a total midnight eclipse in a glass. Sloshing the beer around in your snifter only left syrupy sticky malt all over the sides of your glass. There was absolutely no head to speak of, and sloshing the beer around your glass did nothing but create orange bubbles which quickly burst. Now for the aroma. The aroma yielding anything and everything. Aromas of wood, alcohol, rubbing alcohol, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, molasses, cotton candy, oranges, caramel and some hops. I mean literally...MALT everywhere..you might as well throw the kitchen sink into the aroma as well. You could take a sip and discover something new in the aroma for nearly an hour if you tried. The taste contained heavy caramel malts with candy sugar, vanilla, cotton candy, some orange in the finish, a slight mid-taste hint of hops, and a big snickers bar type mouthfeel. Chunky, thick, sweet and syrupy mouthfeel...ALL MALT. What is astounding is the absolute non-presence of alcohol in this beer. How in the HELL did they hide 13% ABV? This has one of the longest lasting mouthfeels of any beer Ive ever tried. Some nutty molasses qualities toward the end of the bottle. OH man were there some serious yeasty chunks at the bottom of that bottle. Wonderfully chunky coffee and dessert beer. Sweet, voluptuous and full bodied. By far and large the best beer in the world at the moment.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"

I had a bottle at a blind tasting at kps and this got a good score for a good beer. Big, grapey aroma. Coffee is there, but under the fruit. Lingering hop bitterness. A lot of EVERYTHING.

<P>This is thick. It pours thick, it feels thick and it sticks to  your ribs like a stack of pancakes. Pitch black with a thin brown head. The aroma is chocolate, a little vanilla and soy sauce. The flavor continues with the chocolate and soy sauce with a little bit of molasses. Im really surprised to not notice much if any roast malt in the mix.

1016,"2004-06-12",3.2,"OK, this highly anticipated beer was disappointing.  It poured like 10W/40 oil after 10,000 miles use.  Seriously, it is a little scary of a pour.  A very small tan head rims the glass.  Aroma is like Godiva liquor, which is chocolate alcohol.  Thats pretty much all I get here.  Flavor is simple in a way.  Complexity does not apply to this.  Its chocolate, alcohol and molasses.  Thats really it.   Bitterness is actually more subdued than other Imperial Stouts Ive tasted.  The body is sticky and very full.  Now comes the bad part of the beer.  The 2nd half was basically not palatable.  It poured out inconsistently chunky and just plain gross.  I took a single sip and could do no more.  Only one-half of the beer was drinkable.  This is a poor value.  I would definitely not buy this again considering the price...although Im all for trying this on tap.","California, USA","unclebleen"

Darkest, blackest hue, a perfect pitch, color-wise, ebon in its epitome, as soiled as Satans underthings, with a smallish head, but richly roasted, deep tannish brown, quickly succumbing into a tight ring.
Aroma is rich and redolent with all things dark and good, ...molasses speaks up, soy sauce gets a nod, prunes, raisins, port wine, a hint of dark rum, and a glimmer of carob, an intriguing and arresting nose.
Taste: Huge! Thick! Pow, pow, powerful! This is the 800 gorilla on the palate, when it sits around the mouth, it SITS AROUND the mouth!!!
Oh, my, good, loving, freakadelic-alicius-LORD!!!
So rich, it begs the robber barons to empty the playing field, for they havent got the coinage to match this magic! Massive mouthfeel! A sea of chocolate swims on the tongue, and invades every center of the senses! Fruit chimes in too, cherries, and berries, all drenched in chocolate, as well!
A clinging factor pervades the flavor, as well, for this is a taste that never quits, never lets it linger, it stays, and stays, and if youre not ready to make it comforable at your home, it doesnt care, youre taking the couch and Dark Lord is sleeping in your comfy cushy adjusta-bed!!!
WOW!! Luxuriant, like nothing else, rich to the point of delirium, a powerful . liquified candy bar, ....a decadent treat, like no other!
oh, my...puts all other pretenders to shame... a killer-diller,I fear running out of superlatives and will allow this malevolent master to merely stride along this mortal realm with all my blessings, and add the enconium that its a majestic and dangerous thing all in one package...oh, my..in this case, all other previously praised Imperial Stouts must take back-seat, oh, my, though, Mr. Hershey should worry! Mr. Nestle could fret, too..good Lord, its good, almost too much for me...if you want to examine the limits of this style, go no further than Dark Lord!
So heavy on the palate, so huge in flavor!
Bow down, one and all, bow before your Dark Lord, and dont mess around, he can do that finger-chokey- thingy, just like Lord Vader, I mean, theyre practically cousins, so, unless you know some Jedi juju, stray far away from the terrible magic of the Dark Lord...unless you enjoy this particular punishment...which I do!

1016,"2004-06-07",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 29, 2005 March 2004 bottling. Pours thick and extremely dark. It has a reddish hue, and no head. Aroma is full of maple, molasses, grapes, dark fruit, alcohol, cherry, and cut grass. Taste is a bit vinous, but not overly so. Has coffee, dark fruit, maple. Finish is a coffee flavor with a cement feeling. I like thick and creamy beers, but this was too much. I was very careful in pouring, but that didnt help. There is a general sooty/chalkdust feeling throughout the beer. And obviously, the bottom third of the bottle is completely undrinkable. However, I did pour it into my glass, and pick up on a fairly big hoppy nose, which made it smell nice at least.

12/28/04 note: Many (about 8) months of sitting still has yielded about 18oz of decent Dark Lord in my recent opening. Taste is close to the same. Soot isnt as noticeable. Of course, last time I poured my friend the first glass, so that didnt help my glass at all.

Rating 2005-09-24, April 2004 vintage. Very nice to see that there is NO sludge in this bottle. Aroma has roasted pine, velvety chocolate, coffee, green alfalfa, sugary butter. Thick, yet fizzy mouthfeel. Roasted coffee, pine, chocolate, and cherry/vanilla pipe tobacco in taste. Strong coffee finish. Its going to be interesting doing a vertical of this some day. Maybe it was the fact that there was 33% more drinkable beer, but it was simply overpowering at a certain point. Its a great beer, but almost a little too chewy and thick. So to sum up what I just said, its hard to tell if this batch is more overpowering than the last, or if its just the larger volume of beer in the bottle that got to me.

1016,"2004-06-01",3.8,"Bottle scored and shared by Silphium (happy 600!)Aroma is hazelnut, licorice, teryaki sauce, alcohol and malt. The flavor is that of scorched malts that fall just shy of burnt, very black columbian shade grown coffee and malt sugars that I find a bit too sweet. The beer pours so black and sinful that the room actually dims. However the three inches of sludge at the bottom of the bottle occupies a good 5 onces of this $15 beer and can easily ruin the whole bottle if you dont stop pouring at the first hint of cloudiness. This beer leaves an aftertaste of chewed up asprin on the tongue and a off-ish soy sauce tang. Dark Lord carries a lot of expectations that I dont feel were realized. The sludge was a definate negative, the burnt flavors and the foul palate were too strong to deem this one of the great beer wonders of the world, but it is very good imperial. Given the hype, the dark lord wears no clothes.","Salem, Missouri, USA","humulus"
1016,"2004-05-31",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 14, 2011 Rating #100 - This is an excellent brew.  Best Ive ever had?  Not quite.  But even at its young age, its pretty good.  Very little alcohol detected.

1016,"2004-05-29",2.8,"UPDATED: JUN 1, 2005 Oh momma I finally get to have this beer. Reading thtough previous reviews I carefully made the first pour so as not to disturb any of the devilish sediment. The huge thick oily pour produces a 100% pitch black body with a tiny fine particled tan head.    The nose contains a lot of alcohol and chocolate. Big sniffs enduce some stinging in the eyes. No hoppy aromas at all. Molasses and alcohol seem to be the predominate aromas. Not quite as complex, aroma wise, as some other Imperial Stouts I have had. The flavor is tons of molasses, burnt malts (where most of the bitterness seems to come from) and just a bit of piney hops. The palate is a fullas it gets, my jaw almost froze up on first tasting. The aftertaste is lingering, however the complexity is just not there. This is a huge beer and a very unique beer, but it is not the best IS I have ever had. Now for the bad news, after getting down into the last half of the bottle,  by the end of the pour the beer is a as thick as the thickest chocolate milk I have ever had, there is so much astringency as to be unpleasant. This beer needs to settle out for a year or more before it is worthy of all the praise heaped on it.

Feeling sinful and deviant, I released Dark Lord from his cellar (coat closet) and delivered Him to my glass.  This is the thickest beer I have ever tried, although not outrageously thick.  The best way I can describe this beer is to place it along an Imperial Stout ""continuum,"" whereby this occupies a place somewhere between the rich, coffee-dominated Bells Expedition Stout and the overblown, sweet Dogfish Head 23% Worldwide Stout.  I detected strong, sweet burnt malt, molasses, vanilla, coffee, cherry (and maybe red grape) that finished with bitter piney hops.  The overall mouthfeel is very port-like (i.e., very sweet), a bit too sweet for my preferences.  Luckily, Dark Lord is not as sweet as the overblown Dogfish Head WWS 23%, but it misses the strong coffee and balance of Bells Expedition Stout.  Alcohol was surprisingly subdued.  I poured about 16 ounces of quality black molasses-like, thin brown-headed liquid from the bottle.  Just for fun, I took a sip from the remainder, which left an intensely sweet unfermented malt sugar tanginess on the palate.  Obviously, the ""sludge"" part of the beer did not factor into my rating.  I do wish I could get a full bottle of drinkable beer, however.  All in all this is a very good stout but it didnt blow me away, even as a fan of Imperial Stouts, probably because it is too sweet.  The Dark Lord now quivers in his new abode- my stomach.

1016,"2004-05-25",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2004 Striking resemblance to motor oil as it pours. Tan, big-bubbled head thins out quickly, which was expected. I gave the excessive sediment a couple of months to settle, which accumulated to about three inches deep. Mouthfeel is thick, chewy and heavy, not unlike a melted milkshake. Huge molasses sweetness exudes and lingers on the lips. Aromatic and sharp roasty flavors stomp it out a little, with hop bitterness finishing the job. Notes of sherry and whiskey with a warming alcohol sensation. Cornucopia of other flavors as well, such as prunes, dark chocolate, coffee and wood. Much more complex than these words though; Im finding it hard to come up with words to describe some of the flavors. Overall, its an incredible beer ... but its thickness and sediment is a little much. Wasnt able to down the whole bottle alone (too heavy and too sweet).","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

This once incredible brew is back to form, probably as good as 04. 2006 rating follows. Ok, I am lowering my rating of this slightly. The last few vintages are a shadow of the 04. Still an excellent, beer, though. New tasting of the 2005 vintage. I stand by most of my previous notes. However, the aroma is a little more muted. Also, the taste is massive with chocolate and bourbon. A little unbalanced, as I notice more hops in this one. I think this would be incredible after a few years of cellaring. I have to start by saying that hey_kevin is a god!! Had this with him and milkmandan. Thanks. The Dark Lord came out to play and exceeded my expectations, by a mile. This is what all other stouts wish they were. First of all, it sticks to the side of the glass as if it were syrup. Dark as a black hole with abosolutely no chance of light penetrating this. The aroma is amazingly complex. There are strong earthy notes of oak and mushrooms. There are also sweet notes of grapes and molasses. As great a pleasure to drink as it is to smell. This has a very creamy, thick mouthfeel with flavors that linger. The beginning of each drink is sweet with vanilla and is followed by a hoppy, slight dryness. There is a finish of oak, coffee and a sweet smoked jerky. Notes of butterscotch also come through. I have tasted my new highest rated beer!","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

1016,"2004-05-06",2.5,"Bottled version.  This is a 2-part rating, the first dealing with the beer before the ""yeast"" pour, the second after.


Aroma is massively rich, sweet and fruity, notes of semi-sweet chocolate, espresso, grapefruit, plum, earth, pine, red grape, molasses, honey, roasty malt, vanilla, etc. etc.  Thick black color with an oily sheen on the surface and a very slight dark brown head.  Flavor is like a melted chocolate bar mixed with heavy cream, turkish coffee, dirt, dark, vaguely sweet fruits, more molasses and dark honey, faint nuttiness and bitterness; finishes extremely long, moderately bitter and curiously dry.  Body is beyond full, this is pretty much the thickest carbonated beverage imaginable, like stout concentrate (just add water!).    


Now, on to what happened when I poured out the yeast-like substance that completely infused the last 8oz. (about 1/3) of the bottle.


Pouring the gelatinous sediment just ruined the beer.  It now smells like chocolate and moldy oranges.  Appearance is now like something dredged out of a sewer or waste treatment plant, or 20W50 motor oil that hasn’t been changed for about 15,000 city miles.  It was a struggle to even put the glass to my lips at this point, and when I took a sip I instantly regretted it.  Flavor and texture are now that of old coffee grounds and talcum powder mixed into overdone pudding.  Good God, what is this stuff??   It’s sure as hell not like any yeast/sediment I’ve ever seen...not powdery, not grey, but semi-liquid, thixotropic, pervasive in the extreme.  It leaves a texture on the tongue that is beyond grainy and thick; absolutely disgusting.  Dumping it down the drain made me feel briefly guilty for committing a crime against the environment.  


Anyway, my numerical score for this beer is an average of before and after.  Before sediment pour, actually quite intriguing and delicious.  After, a horrible, horrible mistake that should not be inflicted upon any seeker of good beer.  Just what the hell happened here?!","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

But also a quite strong and penetrating alcohol note - actually too strong for my liking and in my opinion too evident for a beer this caliber!!
After taking the first sip I feel the heaviest tasting beer flowing down my throat and into my stomach creating a warm feeling inside! If such a thing as beer concentrate exist this must be it! The flavor is strong and spicy - dark roasted malt, bitter chocolate, espresso and smoke with an underlying sourness and plenty of hops in the finish. 
Very extreme!
All in all a very special beer experience. It's a good stout but in my opinion a little too thick and cloying and not as complex as I could have hoped for!

The beer as it slowly oozes out of the 22 ounce brown bottle pours as thick as molasses in January in Maine, it literally makes a glugging sound as it excavates itself from its container. Onyx in color, the head a deep chocolate brown that is creamy as whipped chocolate icing and portly in size, the lace a coat of brown to obscure the glass. Nose is rich bitter sweet chocolate, burnt coffee, sweet malt, a treat for both the olfactory and ocular senses, a beer you must sniff to understand its complexity, start is thick and chewy, ambrosial and the top as full as any beer Ive ever tasted.

Slow to form, but ultimately thick, three finger thick head that lingers for quite some time, but doesn leave much in the way of lacing on the sides of my 25cl tulip glass.  The beer is pitch black of cours.  Aroma of coffee liquor, dark chocolate, sweetened roasted malt, some smooth alcohol notes.  Much more simplistic than I remember, but it is still rich and definitely satisfies my current hunger for a rich stout.

This beer is definitely thick, rich and mouth coating; definitely on the syrupy side of the beer texture spectrum.  Quite sweet, which really helps to temper the huge roast character, but in the finish the roast becomes quite bitter and perhaps even a bit astringent; the sweetness never fades as both the roast and the rich sweetness really lingers on the palate for a long time.  The dark notes in this beer are layered with bitter black coffee, dark chocolate, acidic roast malt and burnt grain notes.  The mouthfeel is quite rich, but can seem a bit thin at times compared to what I remember this beer being.

When I first had this in 2004, it was so rich and so decadent compared to anything else I had ever had.  This definitely hasnt withstood the test of time.  This is definitely a grand example of the decadent American take on the style, but really isnt nearly as lush, rich or complex as my memory had it being.
2004 bottle release, Sampled April 2004
4.2: 8/4/9/5/17
Strong notes of alcohol and port.  Notes of roast malt, coffee, toffee, chocolate liquor, are also found in the nose.  The beer is thick viscous, and pours a deep midnight black color with a bit of carbonation but only a dusting of bubbles on the surface.  When roused a thick creamy dark brown head forms, one of the darkest heads I have ever seen.  Holy shit, I have never tasted a beer with such a stupefyingly thick body as this.  It is very creamy and coats my mouth, it is like sipping on syrup.  As expected with this body, it is quite sweet. The sweetness is accentuated by a fresh hop flavor, that when combined give this beer a concentrated fruitiness.  This thing must have been heavily hopped in order to have such prominent hop flavor in an Imperial Stout of this stature.  From the front to the middle back of this beer you would guess that this was a bottle of concentrated hop nectar, floral character abounds with, grapefruit, bergamot, cherry, concentrated raisin and plum.  The alcohol is not nearly as evident in the taste and the dark malt flavors are not as strong as I was expecting, the fresh hop character seems to mute them out quite a bit.  The finish is quite bitter, though with the thick mouth-coating malt sweetness it is hard to pick out at first, but it is really the lingering bitterness long after the beer has left my mouth that lets you know that this is bittered quite well.  The dark malt flavors kick in the end as well, just before the bitterness.  Notes of concentrated espresso, bitter chocolate, burnt raisin, burnt caramel.  I must admit that with this intense fresh hop flavor, I am not sure that I want to hold on to the rest of these for a long time, though the 4 inches of sludge at the bottom of this bottle (even after a month of sitting) say that I need to move these to my lagering fridge for quite a bit.  The fresh hop flavor is quite good right now, and it is so dominant that I can not even guess how this beer will continue to age.  I have a feeling that in a year or two this will be a totally and unexpectedly different beer from what it is now.  I have no doubt that the Dark Lord will age gracefully for the next 10 or even 20 years, but will it be better than it is now.  Oh well only time will tell, I will just have to hang on to a couple over the years.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

They should make Dark Lord air fresheners. Smells like a fantastic dessert of chocolate, coffee, and caramel.  The hops come through nicely in the delicious flavor.  Sweetness is quite high, maybe a little excessive, at least in the 2004. Does have some nice balancing roastiness. Definitely the fullest body that Ive ever encountered. Too full even. Requires 32 chews per sip. My favorite line was from erway: ""Im gonna coat my kidneys."" An all-time classic.  Subsequent vintages are obviously cleaner, but have come across as somewhat harsh and excessively bitter. 2004 was one-of-a-kind.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
1016,"2004-04-10",4.3,"This beer redefines mouthfeel. THIS is malty! Like a milkshake! Pours like oil. Aroma is cherries and alcohol. Taste is very smooth with chocolate and alcohol. Minimal roast and coffee flavors.  A little overrated, but still a great beer none the less.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Murphy"
1016,"2004-04-06",5.0,"Rating #1000:
Opaque muddy black color, oily with tan carbonation & mohogany colored head with no lacing. The bottom 1/3 of the bottle is thick, compacted sediment, the top; liquid luxury. The aroma is...wow! Robust is an understatement! Alcohol, muskat grapes, brown sugar, molasses, maple sugar, sour cherries, vanilla, underlying coffee & roast. Strawberry jelly, some soy sauce, macadamian nuts, honey, sage, teriyaki, light tannins and tons of sweetness. The flavor is very balanced (surprisingly) with a bit of alcohol and a roasty chewiness like raisins and fig mixed with expresso mocha, buckwheat AND fresh hops like a crispy IPA. Finish is very mild for an Imperial Stout of this stature. Smooth but of course the massive body and creamy texture. The tail is oily and full with a note similar to whoppers. Lingering long enough to savor completely. Many thanks to Mike the BBB for this holy (or unholy?) bottle of the lord. Many more thanks to all of you fellow ratebeer people I've talked to and to this site in general for awakening me to quality beer. Here I stand at the peak of my achievments so far and realize how far I've come. Me and the dark lord, hand in hand. Into the land of four digits I come, be warned!","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1016,"2004-04-06",4.7,"#600! Thanks to Jordo for sharing! Pours black... evil black. What head was there was dark brown along with the same lacing. Aromas are oh so complex. Brown sugar, toffee, caramel, sour grapes, bread, and a liquor like aroma such as bourbon. Rolls through the mouth leaving a wake of complex flavors. Slightly yeasty. Maple flavors along with alcohol. Molasses, sour grapes, hops, caramel, roasted malts, subtle hints of coffee. Thick as oil. The palate is syrupy alcohol. Finish leaves all the flavors of the beer. Bitterness pervades. There is a paucity of carbonation, but that is expected. The alcohol sends warmth throughout the body after a few drinks. This is a damn fine beer. I bow to a new lord.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Sham"
1016,"2004-04-05",3.5,"I also benefited from EddieG hooking me up with this, although I must say that I was a bit disappointed with this beer, in my opinion it didn't live up to all the hype, the beer was pitch black in color with a bit of a reddish tint, semi-thin dark brown head, nice amount of lacing, roasted aroma with notes of coffee & vanilla, body was very full & thick, almost chewy, warming effect, dark roasted coffee flavors with notes of fruits & more vanilla, finishes on a bit of a burnt note, the body of the beer was a bit too thick & heavy for me, that was about the only thing I didn't like about it, other than that it was a great stout","Pottstown, Pennsylvania, USA","obxdude10"
1016,"2004-04-04",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2004 Thank you EddieG for getting this beer for me.  It pours with a very deep brown to black body with a reddish hue, topped by a huge, brown head that seams to last forever.  An amazing amount of lacing is left on the glass.  The aroma is sweet, fruity and malty with notes of vanilla and alcohol, and an odd roastiness that makes it smell a little like stew.  The flavor starts out sweet, fruity and malty with vanilla notes, slight roasty notes and some alcohol, then it finishes roasty, chocolatey and malty.  This beer is thick as hell and very smooth.","San Diego, California, USA","Vac"

1016,"2004-04-01",4.9,"This is the best Imperial Stout ever made.  I think it is really the ingenious use of ingredients that lend this beer its unique profile.  The hops are just right and blend nicely, the body is silky smooth, hinting that they possibly used oats to impart such a silky smooth texture.  The beer is high in alcohol, but it is very well hidden.  They hit a homerun on this one.  Now if you could only find it on the shelf.  I was lucky enough to get some at the Real Ale Fest from a firkin. (MapRoom, Chicago)","USA","mneil9799"
1016,"2004-03-30",4.3,"Yes, I am being impatient. Initial pour is near black and oily. Look a lot like used oil from a diesel engine. Small but dense head of dark tan bubbles. Smooth and silky feel. Rich malt, fresh hops, and alcohol all sneak out of the lair. I pour the remaining sludge into a separate glass. Dark brown soup. Heavy aromas of fresh picked hops. Try this and it is mostly hops and yeast flavors with a late hops bite. Mix the two to create a murky brown substance with some specks of white yeast. Cream soup feel.  Malt dominates with mild chocolate, and light fruit. late hops and alcohol burn. Chewy beyond any other brew that I can remember. This is not beer it is a malt shake. My lips are stuck together. I can hardily wait to try my other bottle in about 5 year. This should be absolutely fantastic by then. Kudos to DavidP for dropping this one off.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1016,"2004-03-30",4.4,"I don't need to repeat the superlatives offered by others.  A pitch, thick, black, oil of a beer with a caramel head.  Roasted, chocolate, fruity, slightly vinous aroma.  A bitterness marks the end of the flavor, after experiencing a blend of numerous other flavors.  Huge flavors, long finish, big beer brewing at its best.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
1016,"2004-03-29",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 5, 2005 Heresy: I realize that I risk excommunication but here goes...The pour is indeed the thickest I have seen.  Bubbles rise to the top and then disappear with a soda like fizz.  The head has tints of red and the beer below looks like liquid chocolate.  Not much aroma, but a faint whiff of cherries and raisins.  Mouthfeel is divine- feeling, though not tasting like liquid chocolate.  Taste is of intense raisins followed by orange peel bitterness.  The fruit gives way to a port-like taste and alcohol burn.  Beer leaves a film of dried sediment on the glass.  I cannot detect any chocolate, roastiness or malt smoothness.  The raisin is absolutely overpowering and distracting.  If you like port or chocolate covered fruit peel- this is your stout.  While it is quite an experience to drink/eat this beer- it is not an experience that I will seek out again.  I am interested to know if age would mellow the raisin and bring out the chocolate.  Ed- I thank you for the opportunity.

Re-rate 05 Release- Thats better. Loads of big beautiful bing cherries nestled in chocolate, yeasty malt.  Wonderfully aromatic hops that balance out the huge sweetness. Now I see what the fuss is about.  Still not my favorite imp stout- I would make this number three below Expedition and Oak Aged Yeti.","Mt Kisco, New York, USA","Brewso"
1016,"2004-03-28",4.0,"Holy, holy crap!!  Beer-flavoured yogurt!  That was the typical response last night, when we popped this bottle open.  Pours such a thick, black beer.  This is 5W-15.  No kidding.  I don't know how I ever got it down my throat it was so thick.  Aroma is basically all alcohol, roasted/burntness and malt / molasses.  Flavour is very burnt and nutty.  If you like them dark and burnt, this is your beer.  Otherwise, it's a bit much.","Ft. Worth, Texas, USA","adwoan99"
1016,"2004-03-28",4.3,"alcohol, blood, milk chocolate and vanilla aroma, suspended sediment in a brown/black sea, pours like mud, cherry fruitiness then slick mocha into intensely bittersweet chocolate, incredibly intense but maybe too much so, it lacks in subtlety like a hollywood blockbuster compared to a fellini film","Sisters, Oregon, USA","Zach Diesel"
1016,"2004-03-27",2.5,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2010 This is a beer for the easily-impressed.


Pours a thick and pitch black. I had to pour the last bit into a separate glass because of the thick, soft-serve-like sludge from the bottom of the bottle.  My guess is I got about 18 ounces of the stuff to drink, and 4 to eat.  After it was poured into the glass, a small amount of brown bubbles began to form, eventually forming a head about 1 finger thick.  The aroma is a creamy hop concoction, with a roasted licorice presence and sweet burnt fruit.  Incredibly thick mouth feel, morphing into a sweet sugary flavor and then finally settling out into a sticky coating in the finish, but incredibly overpowering with a sour and lactic yeast overtone.  Wow... this is not good... too big and too think in this case is a bad move.  Long lasting residual chocolate and roasted bitter hops.  Flavor... hmm, how can I describe it... coffee and sweet molasses, vanilla, yes, acidic leafy hop flavor.  Thick like yogurt of death.  The residual coating in your mouth is similar to letting dark chocolate slowly melt in your mouth but with a stick of butter added, and thats the big problem I have with this stout.  The aroma is a bit lackiing, and theres a harsh cream and butter aroma not found in the flavor. You could almost convince me I was drinking chocolate syrup.


Drinking another bottle in December 2004, 8 months after it was released, and I just really dont like it at all.  Slimy, full of abrasive yeast (and this is NOT a mixed up bottle, it was poured well separated) and some bad alcohol and cream flavors.  Im missing the imperial stout in this bottle... really disappointing.  I have one left, and will keep it for a few more years before trying... and after having this one I dont think that will be difficult.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1016,"2004-03-26",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 2, 2005 Aroma:  smells like burnt carmel corn, dark chocolate, roasted malts, and coffee.  Has a very heavy lingering scent.

Appearance:  Dark, dark, dark light barely penetrates, if at all.  tan brown head.

Flavor:  very thick, creamy and smooth chocolate flavor, like a very well-made hot coco.  Flavors of cream, bittersweet and dark chocolates, vanilla, roasted malts, and molasses.  No overwhelming hoppiness like some of their beers but still vaguely found in the finish (and aftertaste).

Palate:  an incredibly drinkable beer.  quite thick and smooth--the consistency of drinking melted dark chocolate or motor oil.  The substance completely coats the inside of the mouth, throat, and scents up into the nose with effects lasting beyond the last sip.  great dark chocolate finish, tainted slightly with a bit of hops.  

Overall:  By far the best imperial stout I have ever had.  happy our criminal friends were so stupid.","Adamstown, Maryland, USA","lilannie"
1016,"2004-03-25",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 23, 2005 Rating #700 I have to say this is the best beer Ive had in my life. Forgetting all the hype that its not ready just yet and it needs a few weeks to settle, its better than anything as it is. This beer has everything you want in Imperial Stout and then some. Ladies and Gents (and fellow RBers) the bar has been raised. Go figure a brewery in Indiana does it. Not that Dreadnaught isnt good (its better than Ruination to me), this beer is fantastic. 

Flavors? The chocolate, vanilla, raisins and dried fruits all intermingle to provide sensory overload. The malty sweetness combined with the bitter hoppiness, make this the stuff legends are made of. Viscosity (I got that from a Castrol commercial) of light chocolate syrup. This stuff coats your glass like dirty oil does to your oil pan. There is residue all over the place. If my tongue were an inch longer, I would have licked the bottom and sides of my pint glass. 

To any other brewer that reads this review, its time you stop fucking around and get in the game, especially if you are currently brewing Imperial Stout. We all know legends like Gretzky, Jordan and Woods only come around once in a lifetime, but before them there was Howe, Chamberlain and Nicklaus. Therefore, now that this new milestone has been created, its time to think outside the box. If you make it, they will pay for it. You brewers have a responsibility to educate the public and increase the publics awareness. Most of you are brewing bullshit and you know it. Be the best. You have the tools, knowledge and ability. To steal a phrase from Nike, Just Do It. This beer is not only great, but has inspired me to not only do better at my job but be a better person in life. Finally, to the genius that concocted this liquid brilliance, I love you, man.

This stuff is unreal. Thanks to jcapriotti for sending me 2 bottles of this nectar.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","frylock"
1016,"2004-03-23",4.7,"Wow. This one really delivered. It is probably the most flavourful beer that I have, and ever will taste. I didn't really notice too much in the aroma, just a malty chocolate. As for the appearance, it is dark. A very thick dark black colour. A creamy reddish/tan head sits upon the top. Flavor is extremely complex and will require many tastings to explain fully. As for now, I will describe the flavor as a  rich, extra creamy, chocolate. Also has hints of sugar and dark roasted coffe.  There is a little blast of alcohol in the finish. Texture is very thick, oily, and as creamy as a beer can get. Thoroughly coats the mouth and throat. Makes my mouth feel wonderful. The flavor stayed with me for a long time after it was finished. Everything about this beer is terrific. Superb. Very bold and not for the weak hearted.","Warsaw, New York, USA","DrinkingbuddyD"

1016,"2004-03-22",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2005 2004. Pours a thick, dark, chocolate brown, head almost the same color as the body, a good amount of yeast. Aroma of chocolate, smoke, vanilla, and a touch of alcohol. The aroma was great, although a little lighter. The fattest, chewiest body Ive ever come across by far. Like drinking pudding. Flavor was delicious: chocolate creme, vanilla, roasty malt, some underlying hops, and a little bit of alcohol to say ""dont f%#$@ with this."" I cant believe I wasnt let down by this. Totally deserving of the praise it gets. Excellent. 8/4/10/5/19 2005 bottle: far dryer, heavier on the roast which throws of the balance from the big chocolate cream. Not as full of a body either, although the 2004 was like drinking pudding.

Vintage 2004 2008-05-17.  Black syrupy body with a modest dark khaki head. Sweet aroma, interesting fruity notes, light roast, sweet malt. (7+) Sweet malty foundation in the flavour with a lot of hop and roast bitterness. Light fruit/raisin notes. (7+) Think syrupy palate is full bodied but less rich than my memory of it. Admittedly it IS 4 years old, and I probably remember it being thicker than it was! I think it has reached the point where it is starting to go downhill, but is still lovely on its own merits. Many thanks to Frylock for the chance to have a second look from the same trade! 8/4/8/4/16-17 - 4.1  At Rudolfs, shared by Frylock
Vintage 2004/5 (Pink Wax) Black body with a small but thick brown chocolate milk coloured head. Lightly acidic malt dominates the aroma, with hints of raisins and other dark fruits. Mild alcohol presence and a light something I cannot place. Flavour has a lot of moderate lightly acidic roast malt throughout. A dry but not chalky cocoa finish makes sure to paint your mouth on the way down, with a slowly diminishing refrain. Full oily palate is quite nice. (4+) but still lacks that thick yogurt like body that I remember from my first sampling. Whether or not that first taste was as full bodied and smooth as I remember is another question. Thanks for sharing Paul, this is always a rare treat!  7-8/4/8-9/4+/17-18 - 4.4

Vintage 2005 RBSG 2005. Dark oily black body with a chocolate coloured head coats the glass. Aroma of mild acidity roast and dark chocolate. Dark roasty bitterness and some bitter chocolate, much more bitterness than expected. Full bodied palate yet still significantly thin compared to the 2004 I sampled. 7/4/7/4/15 - 3.7
Original Rating Bottle. 2004 Vintage Rated March 2004 at my apartment Beer Christening. Good chocolate coloured head sits proudly but does not linger long upon its throne of a thick viscous body that smoothly caresses its way across the palate. Frequent fleeting visits of mildly roasty bitter chocolate and occasionally the smallest clue that belies the alcoholic content of this fabulous beer. Layers of complexity in the flavour seem to reach out and taunt me with the fact that I will not soon have a chance to sample them again, before leaving me to ponder the brown film left across my glass. Part of me had hoped that a trip through Ontario might lessen the Dark Lords power but he has brought me into his fold and I am a true believer.

1016,"2004-03-18",4.9,"UPDATED: APR 30, 2005 The bottle is just awesome, crowned with deep red wax and sporting a Todd McFarlane/Spawn-esque label. The beer pours like black velvet with thick milk chocolate mousse for a head. Aroma is powerful dark chocolate, molasses, coffee, vanilla and herbal notes reminicent of Jagermeister. So intimidating Im almost afraid to taste it. The opening is tingly and a bit tart then malts roll across the tongue in thick velvety waves. Finish is dry with just a hint of alcohol. Dangerously drinkable for a beer of this magnitude. Simply a killer beer well worth all the praise. Thanks for sharing BrooklynBoy.------ Release: All that I said above still applies. While removing the sediment was good on one hand, I think a touch of the character went with it. Im also worried that it wont age as well.

1016,"2004-03-16",5.0,"Pours a thick black without much more than a trace of head. It looks as omninous once poured as it did hiding behind that scary label.

The aroma is quite complex, lots of scents detected, most noteably: Leather, licorice, chocolate, raisins, coffee, half-way dried roses, and maybe a hint of alcohol.

Very complex flavor, I can't quite sort it all out. It's very heavy on the dried fruits and chocolate. Coffee notes are present throughout but seem to play just underneath the threshold. Slightly smoky finish.
More notes can be deciphered but I can't find names for them all, besides whatever I did call them would sound something like ""'x' crossed with 'y' with a hint of 'z'."" All the flavors combine synergistacally(sp?) combine to form liquid poetry in my mouth. This beer is like a whore that is trying to get with every tastebud in my mouth that it can! 

The mouthfeel is incredibly thick and creamy without being offensive in any way.

Drinkability is out of this world for a beer of this magnitude. I can't think of a beer with this abv that is this well hidden. The beer is infinitely interesting so boredom is no worry.

1016,"2004-03-15",5.0,"UPDATED: MAY 10, 2005 2005 version:  It was with great anticipation that I awaited the release of Dark Lord.  Promoted a club trip to Three Floyds with tailgating and all.  Make it an event.  Well, it was fun.  As for the beer . . . .    This years batch is missing a dimension.  Oh, the aroma is mostly there and the flavor is there and the appearance is there but the mouthfeel, the body has lost some of its lustre.  Filtering?  Perhaps.  Last years had that oily mouthfeel, that richness that clung to the tongue and embraced the tastebuds and made the mouth feel all warm and cuddly.  That is missing this year.  I gave last year a perfect 5.0 because I thought it was as damned near perfect as a beer could be.  This years deserves high marks, too, but the change in the mouthfeel precludes any perfect score.  Why mess with perfection?  Yes, this is still an outstanding beer but just not up to last years standards.




2004 version:  Oh my god!  This is awesome.  From the label to the aftertaste it was an amazing experience.  The label artwork is a masterpiece.  Hey, Nick, make T-shirts, posters, etc.  Open it and pour.  Jet black with a thick, foamy, dark tan head.  Perfection.  Take a sniff.  Its a beer you can get excited by just from the aroma.  Chocolate, coffee, molasses.  The taste?  If I wrote a novel, it couldnt convey that flavor.  Wow.  Did I say Wow already?  Well, Im speechless.  And I was able to share the experience with two good buddies, Gasspasser and Alcoholist.  This beer lived up to the hype.  It deserves the hype.  Its NOT hype.  Its fact.

The nose is full of rich spicy citrusy floral hops in the back of the nose there is some bits of suggar and herbs, similar to that of jagermeister.

The flavor was terrific with vanilla and molasses, which were sweet but the bitterness and lasting warmth down your throat was balancing. The palate make me feel like I was drinking chocalate milk, in fact the lacing made the glass look it it had chocolate milk in it. I knew this beer was powerful when it broke my bottle opener.

1016,"2004-03-14",4.8,"I was really hoping to hate this beer, especially at $15/22 oz. bottle.  Shared this brew with my wife and two friends.  Consensus from each of us was that this was the best beer any of us have ever had.  This was not like drinking beer, it deserves its own category.  It's not a beer, food, dessert or cigar.  It's like taking the best things in life and putting it in one bottle.  Almost undescribeable.  Aroma is creamy with chocolate and coffee notes.  Head is thin and dissipates quickly.  Appearance, who cares, how does it taste?  Flavor--I don't really know how to describe it.  There was chocolate, coffee, pudding, toffee, raisins, caramel, hops and it changed nicely as it warmed.  The alcohol is hidden very well.  

Was this worth $15 for a bottle?  Hell yes!  I bought two bottles and would have gladly taken a case if I had sampled it before hand.  My beer lifetime goal is to somehow get a keg of this someday and take a vacation to enjoy it.","Bloomington, Illinois, USA","dlclark"

<h5>08 Bottling.</h5>
Rum, coffee bean and dark chocolate aroma.  Fantastic, smooth flavor.  Berries, chocolate, the chocolatey side of coffee, vanilla and sweet brown cane sugar underneath.  This stuff is fantastic considering how new it is.



<h5>04 Bottling. - 7 4 10 5 20</h5>
Opaque black body, short-lived thin brown head.  
Quite viscous, foam and liquid cling to the side of the glass when swirled.  
Im not getting much aroma, some fruity bittering hops, and burnt coffee with chocolate and molasses.  
Its hard to see because of the dark color, but theres a lot of dusty yeast particles floating around.  
Big big flavor and mouthfeel.  
The first half of the flavor features intense chocolate roast,  vinous flavors and a cane sugar sweetness.  
Finishes with coffee bitterness, which seems to be a combination of malt and the Floyds usual hopping flavors.  
Decadently creamy mouthfeel, one its strongest points.  
A very enjoyable beer -  Ive had others with big flavors but they were always unpleasantly heavy on the alcohol.  
I cant taste ANY alcohol in this beer, which I greatly appreciate.

<h5>05 Bottling.</h5>
Black body with a long-lasting tan head which after it settles down leaves a uniform coating on the glass.  
Overall it has a sweet aroma of cream and chocolate, leafy hops, a touch of rum alcohol too.  
Theres an extravaganza of malt in the flavor; barleywine-esq dark fruited malts (cherries, plum) along with rich french press coffee and dark chocolate.  In the roasty, sweet finish that classic Floyds hop character comes through.

2004 bomber-pours as black ad black can get with a red tint along the rim of the sinfter. very little head and/or carbonation.  not a huge aroma, but the aroma was full of cherries, chocolate, and hops.  Is this palate humanly possible?  coffee, chocolate, dark fruits, citrus, cherries and a ton of hops when cold, but as it warmed, the chocolate notes became stronger.  Some flavors of burbon barrel aging on the body.  Not a hint of alcohol anywhere to be found.  Nick Floyd can do no wrong here.  HOLY SHIT, or is that UNHOLY SHIT.

I had heard so many things about this one that I almost shit when I hear they had an aged growler of it for us at the RateBeer Summer Gathering 2003.  It poured a small head of dark brown fine to large sized bubbles.  It has a mild coffee molasses aroma.  The body of this brew is something to behold.  It is dark, thick and I mean thick!  70,000 mile old motor oil thick and black as a black hole in space.  It has a very strong coffee flavor that was suprisingly smooth initially then finished with a lingering burning sensation from the alcohol.  It is definately in a class of its own!  Truely a masterpiece!  All hail the Dark Lord!

2006 Release Rerate:
This bottled brew from the brewery at the release party poured a head of foamy finely sized dark brown colored bubbles that was mostly lasting and left behind an opaque black colored body and a very good oily lacing. The mild aroma was malty with chocolate coffee hop and dark malt notes. The mildly vinous mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish with a strong mild vinous hop dark malt aftertaste.

I expected to see the Eye of Mordor appear over the freshly poured glass. Completely black as Doom with a very thin dark beige head. Aroma is not subtle, it is mostly coffee, malt and alcohol. The flavor doesn't bother tip-toeing around either. Warming alcohol flavor gets progressively stronger as it warms, but never snuffs out the other flavors of cocoa, coffee, surprisingly sweet malt, and raisins. There are enough hops in the finish to keep it from being too much. This beer is utterly perfect in every respect.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

As I sit here a head does grow apon the beer as it waits patiently.  A fine yellow tan froth is a good description.  Just to see exactly how ""Dark"" this beer really is, I plugged in a 500 watt Halogen work light and held the beer in front of it in a clear Chimay chalice.  Not a drop of light could be seen though it! Now thats  DARK! .  To me, the aroma of this is definately coffee, vanilla and molasses just as the commercial description says.  I also have to say that it has a slight Salami smell.  No its not my glass!  I do not get a chocolate aroma from this brew.  Sipping this beer, I must admit it is thicker than any beer I have yet tried, similar in consistency to half and half.  Big sweet malt taste, with nuts and butter on the back end.  Very creamy and velvety on the palate.  The flavor has gotten a little grape note as it warmed a few degrees.  A wonderful beer that is like no other.

When poured into the glass from the big glass, it was black, black and powerful as the name, and thick like a bottle of 10W 40. When held up to a high intensity light I noticed that the black wasn’t actually black, but a blood brown black. Dense was the color. The head seemed to bubble up towards the end, like the dark lord rising from the black primordial beginnings, its color was a medium brown color, thick but not deep. As I stuck my finger into it to see if it was as sticky as it looked, I swear I felt a pulling sensation. It was sticky but left no lace on the side of the glass. The aroma was intense! I nosed cherries, sweet malt (molasses), tobacco (like skoal or coppenhagen), wichester sauce and as I stirred it, the alcohol peaked its nose up at me and whispered “I’m here too”. The taste was thick and creamy. If there was carbonation I missed it. Not flat, just thick. I noticed flavors of sweet molasses, spices, port wine, fruit (cherries) as it warmed I also noticed hints of chocolate and more cherries and alcohol. Like many beers of this type this only got better as it warmed, warmed from the fires it was born from, stirred and created from the Dark One himself. Truly one of the greatest brews made. I felt different after only consuming 2 ½ pints of this potion, different like I was possessed. The wife said that she was either going to call a priest for a exorcism or take me straight to church because of the look on my face. It was an experience all its own.

Pretty thick chewy body, oily, smooth with immense flavors that just takes your whole sense of taste hostage. Burnt currants and chewy, sweet malts with hints of molasses, cherry, bittersweet chocolate and others. Lots of complexity and dangerously smooth for its size. Hops show up at end to try and balance the big sweetness but man, the flavor just lingers forever then a little kick of expresso pushes in.  The alcohol is hidden nicelyfor it does not taste 13%. This is a big complex imperial that distinguishes itself from the rest. A bit sweet and maybe needs a lttle more carbonation but worthy of the hype.

1016,"2003-01-09",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 17, 2005 2005 bottle.

Head is initially small, frothy, dark brown, mostly diminishing.
Body is opaque black (flashlight tested).

Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, dark chocolate), lightly hoppy (resin, apricot), with notes of alcohol and licorice.

Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.
Finish is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, heavily bitter.

Full body, syrupy/creamy texture, soft/lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

Much better than the [IMHO] ruined 2004 bottled batch (which had hardly any aroma [and what was there wasnt that pleasant], was cloyingly/syrupy sweet, and had a disturbing mouthfeel like split-pea soup), which I dumped down the drain after several months of resting and an hour of sampling deliberation, but I still cant say this one is quite in my top five Impy stouts.  Very good overall, no doubt, but...the aroma just isnt that powerful, complex, or exciting.  Its pretty extreme, decadent, and very well-balanced, flavor-wise, and is unusually thick and rich in the mouth, but the aroma is surpisingly ordinary for the style.  Whereas some beers are more exciting to smell than drink (Unibroue), this is the reverse.

March 2004 bomber. Virtually no head. Body is absolutely opaque black. Aroma is lightly malty (chocolate, molasses), lightly hoppy (resin, apricot), with a light note of soy sauce. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. FULL body, syrupy/pea-soup texture, soft carbonation, lightly alcoholic. What I want to know is, what the hell happened (see review of previous years batch below) to screw this up so badly?  The aroma is extremely faint and uninteresting, for starters (even in my usual brandy snifter sampling glass, still almost nothing there to smell). Literally the consistency of split-pea soup (and thats before we get down to the bottom of the bottle where Lovecraftian horror awaits)...I used to think the thicker the better, but this is beyond the limits of enjoyment...its downright disconcerting and unpleasant to ""drink"".  Just too many suspended solids.  The flavor balance is mostly as before, virtually all sweetness with little to balance.  Of course its opaque which makes the appearance score high, but damn, this is an absolute catastrophe, to the tune of Drain Pour Blues. This is one of the worst years for Imperial Stouts, I must say! Avery, Brooklyn, and now this one fail to live up to past batches, but this one is by far the most disappointing.  (4/4/5/2/9 = 2.4)

12 oz bottle filled from a growler (Jan/03). Head is initially small, frothy, brown, mostly diminishing. Body is absolutely opaque black.

Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium to full body, oily texture, soft carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

We held it up to 500 watt spotlights and nothing shone thru.  Aroma was not as strong as the taste.  It seems that many imperials lean towards the roasty side, this ones all about the chocolate  - like Hersheys Dark Extreme.  I wouldnt exactly call the palate ""thick"", more ""full"" - when I took a sip, my entire mouth was filled with flavors - not just the tongue - the roof of my mouth, the back of my throat; and warmth as it oozes down to my belly.  It left a sticky residue everywhere.  The sweetness on the sides became cloying as it warmed, but at the same time, some medium roasted flavors came out.  I know theres some hops in there, but it could actually use a little more to dry out the sweetness.  Did not taste the 13% at all, but felt it a little.

1016,"2002-12-22",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 16, 2005 2005 issue: Not-quite-opaque molasses brown. Sandy, finely-bubbled mocha foam. Alluring nose of rich java, mocha chocolate, and molasses. Lightly yeasty and vaporously alcoholic, as well, with glazed pecan, burnt toffee, and vanilla hints. Rush of velvety-soft carbonation fills the palate. Lip-sealing mixture of chocolate fudge and molasses quell the cheek-buckling alcohol. Intensity is off the charts, but theres loads of char, sharply-vinous fruitiness, and alcohol to assist the initially-overt richness. Takes on more graininess as alcohol couples with the firm roastiness to slowly pierce the wall of viscosity. Brief soft coffee bean and cinnamon flavor gracefully collide with the delicate underbelly of assorted berries and ink. Closes with a sizeable black malt/burnt cookie bite backed with a flash of arid roast and rich java. Theres nothing terribly unique about this (with the exception of the interesting yeast character), but it certainly is a huge improvement upon last years [bottled] version, which was less lush and overly viscous in the mouth. Much like Expedition right out the gate, its rough around the edges, albeit highly delicious, when fresh, but like Expedition, this will become more magical with each passing moment in the cellar..","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Very smooth, although still quite thick, but seems to have aged well.

2008 bottle sampled on 5/3/08: Same oily viscous appearance as always.  Aroma of sweet, rich dark caramel and chocolate with some roasty coffee notes and dark fruits.  Smooth, full flavored and sweet dark malty before a rich, creamy bittersweet dark chocolate finish.  Definitely as tasty as I remember from years past.

2004 bottle sampled on 2/26/07: Pours a very opaque, extremely viscous with a thin dark brown, wispy head and body that coat the glass upon swirling.  Rich, complex dark chocolate aroma has some aged caramel malt and mild, light fruity esters.  Body starts with a full, sweet raisiny, plum, brown sugar complexity with lots of thick caramel malt and earthy bittering hops toward a balanced dense finish that hides the alcohol extremely well.  Its like eating a rich dark chocolate cake (9,5,9,5,18).

2006 vintage bottle sampled on 7/2/06: Pours a dark opaque with dark mahogany edges and a dark brown, thin-lacing head.  Sweet caramel malty and dark chocolatey aroma has a big strawberry fruitiness.  Body starts with a big sweet viscous caramel maltiness and some light fruitiness with a more complex mild raisin and plum character.  Well-balanced and should age well for years to come.

2004 vintage bottle sampled on 6/11/06 courtesy of EddieG: Still about 6 oz of sediment in the bottle.  Pours a thick and oily black with only a ring of dark tan head.

On balance, this is better.  I""m not calling it perfect yet, but its really close and I""m going to have a hard time not killing the growler in the next day or so.  Behemoth and Alpha Klaus here I come!

Jan 11 ""03:  bumping it up a point because A) it lasted near a month in a frequently-opened growler losing nothing but about half its carbonation and B) I get a stronger, more sensuous nose, spicier and more perfumy.  Near perfection, the equal of NC Old Rasputin.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

1016,"2002-12-13",4.8,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2016 (2007 re-rate)Bottle... This beer still rocks!... Pitch black, high viscosity pour creates little fanfare... small, quickly diminishing, rust-colored head. The aroma is an intoxicating swirl of burnt caramel, tobacco, dried plum, chocolate, oozing molasses, distilled ethanol, charcoal and tawny port. The chocolaty flavor is black cherry and molasses-sweet with overtones of burnt, singed hop and alcohol bitterness. Undertones of tobacco and charcoal. Nothing subtle about this monster! Ultra-mega full-bodied with the consistency of SAE 40 weight motor oil (after 12,000 miles of hard driving with no air filter) and restrained, but ticklish, carbonation.  So many breweries have tried to copy this impy stout; some come close, but no one matches it ... and Ive tried a lot of imperial stouts (132 and counting). I drank my first plastic cup of Dark Lord in an ice-cold brewery in Munster, IN back in December of 2002, a couple years before the stuff was bottled for the first time. I chased it with a cup of a new IIPA named Dreadnaught... and my world was forever changed... for the better. Thanks goes out to headbanger for seeing to it that I was able to try the 07 release only four days after DLD 07!  Best bottled version of DL Ive tasted to date! Drinking a glass of Dark Lord has always been more than just drinking a glass of beer. Its always an experience. Re-rate = 4.8
(Original rating)Draft... This beer rocks!... Everything an Imperial Stout should be. Pours as dense and black as used motor oil. Black as midnight during a new moon. No... blacker than that. Ridiculously huge, creamy, light brown head. Incredible lacing.
The aroma is of chocolate, alcohol, coffee, black strap molasses and all other things DARK! The flavor is rich and malty-sweet up front. Notes of molasses, dark chocolate and espresso. Very well-hopped on the backside. Very Victory Storm King-like, only much more dense. To describe this glass of beer as full-bodied wouldnt do it justice. It has the body of Anna Nicole Smith... no, Kate Smith! Syrupy mouthfeel. Lively carbonation. These bubbles have to be on steroids to work their way up through the murk! Long, bittersweet, heavy, yet slightly dry finish. My 8 oz. cup of this treasure must have weighed five pounds. I didnt know whether to curl it or drink it. So, I did both. I hammer-curled it up to my mouth for each delightful sip. My buddy, who has a very high tolerance for Coors Light was drunk after 1/3 of his cup. THIS BLACK HOLE OF A BEER IS DEFINITELY THE CENTER OF ALL GRAVITATIONAL PULL! World class effort!Original Score = 4.7","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1016,"2002-12-13",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2004 Update 10/9/04. Sampling from the bottled version as opposed to the draft bottled version hopsrus sent. The sludge that is the last 1/3 of this bottle completely detracts from this beer. If you pour any in your glass you will get an almost gritty mouthfeel. Not pleasant and I hope they take care of this in future bottlings. Docking points in appearance and palate accordingly. Pitch black pour with a head the color of rich dark cocoa. Nose is creamy if a smell can be creamy? Full of sweet and bitter notes. The body of this is unbelievable. Smooth and supple, has to be tried to understand. Flavor is ... I give up this beer is a 5 all the way. I dont give 5's but this beer is a 5. It is by far the most complex and satisfying beer I have ever had. The flavors are vanilla sweetness balanced by a dark chocolate bitterness. A perfect yin and yang give and take going on all over your tongue.Westy was great but this is better.Many many thanks to hopsrus for this brew.I owe you big for this one.","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"
1016,"2002-12-13",4.7,"UPDATED: MAY 1, 2003   I am stunned by the complexity and perfection of this beer. I'm not sure that it's better than Westy 12 or 8, but it is damn close for sure. Flavor is deep, dark chocolate. Slight roasted flavor, very little fruit but possibly a hint of wine and berries. The most impressive feature of this beer is its incredibly smooth and soft mouthfeel not only in the finish but especially in the nose. Literally moved up 2 points on my scale as it warmed, it just keeps getting more and more complex and drinkable as well. Moderate hops in the finish. ABV is covered as perfectly as WWS, and the mouthfeel is much softer. I give this the edge. Near perfection.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
1016,"2002-12-13",4.7,"Wow! Incredible. Dark as night. No head. Huge aroma of wine, figs, plums, berries, and coffee. The mouthfeel is unreally smooth. No hint of the huge abv. The flavor of wine, figs, berries, coffee, roasted grains, and candied dark fruits becomes more complex as you drink. I would give westy 12 a slight edge but i think this is hands down the best beer in America.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Jake Barnes"
1016,"2002-12-13",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 19, 2016 (First version, hand-bottled from the tap in 2002):Amaretto-filled chocolate truffles, aniseed, berries roam within this sumptuous Imperial Stouts hefty mouthfeel, while black pepper and resinous subtleties emerge from sagacious hops, only to be engulfed by huge caramel, maple syrup-like sweetness...4.8...

(Bottled 2005 version): Agressive roastiness thrives in the portly body, but bigger bubbles diminish the viscosity. Still, one of the thickest beers out there, but simply not as huge as the tap version I had, or the 2004 bottle, imho. Green, citrusy hops are also more obvious in this young monster, blending perfectly with the roasty bitterness. Still an excellent imperial stout, but not the spectacularly balanced and refined behemoth that the 2 previous tastings had proven. 4.1/5

(Bottled versions from 2009 on):Abrasive alcohol burns the heavy molasses, while deep cherry fruitiness surrounds resinous hops. 65% cocoa sweetness attempts to link it all, but this is still quite brash. Very flavorful, but nowhere near refined yet. How many years is it going to take? 3.7...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
1016,"2002-12-08",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2004 Re-rate 2004-I didnt care for this years batch.  The balance between the sweetness and the hops that I liked so much wasnt there anymore.  The colors was a brown and not a black.  Much more coffee flavors than I remembered.  A shear dissappointment.

One of finest beers Ive had.  Thick, malty sweet.  Reading the reviews of the RBers I was drinking with Racegoer,Jaymobrown and marinaro500 and I agree with what theyre saying.  After Ive tried all the beers that I can try, I might rerate this a 5, but for now I dont rate 5s.  Rating then: 4.9","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
1016,"2002-12-07",5.0,"Insanely Thick, poured to me by Floydicus himself, deep dark,& rich, malty, absolutley outstanding. We did a side by side by side with WWS 18% & 23%, Dark Lord blew them away, complex, flavours of chocolate, coffee, malt, superb hops. This is a world class beer ! Highly Recommended","Indiana, Indiana, USA","Racegoer"

1016,"2002-12-07",4.9,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2004 A brew worthy of a 4.9.   Deep chocolatey goodness.  Thick & sweet with a head that will last until March 25th!!!!   Really cool abv of about 13 percent or so.  Absolutely nothing offensive or too strong. We had it alongside a DFHWWS18% and 23% and it beat their taste and quality.   Anyone can drink this Imperial stout without being overwhelmed. This is just perfect..  Perfect. Perfect.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
1016,"2002-11-12",4.9,"The only thing that keeps me from giving this a perfect score is that its just a little overwhelming. Seriously, it takes me at least an hour to work through a 10 oz. snifter of this amazing beer. The Floyds have completely out-done themselves this time. This stuff is loaded with unfermented malt--its sweet, sticky, gooey--pours from the tap like molasses. But it still has all the amazing character of a beer thats been aging for years. Some strong vinous notes, some black cherries, some motor oil...A kick of hops to keep it from overwhelming with its coffee/toffee sweetness. This is a beer worth hunting down. Lets just hope the Floyds keep brewing it.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
1016,"2002-11-09",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2005 [Waxed (orange) dipped 22 oz. botlle, 2005 release - fresh]: outrageous viscous pour I have come to expect: darker and more opaque than a moonless night on a secluded mountain top in New Zealandrust coloured foam gathers at the edges, simply gorgeous.  Sharp coffee bean aroma with heavily charred mahogany and cedar.  Aroma is very raw, lacking the development of the sweet, chocolaty undertones and fruity esters.  Wow, amazingly creamy, coating like all of the others, but this one is far softer on the palate - the carbonation is much tighter, smoother than any I remember, except on draft 2+ years ago.  Flavours and young and again a bit raw, but strangely relaxed; bitter chocolate coated coffee beans, burnt toast, chalky carbon, and crystallized caramel.  A raisiny bitterness comes on fairly strong through the finish, with the alcohol only noticeable as an after thought.  A significant improvement over last years bottling (I was able to pour and enjoy the entire bottle), and one that I believe will improve and develop over the next few years. <4.4+>

[Waxed (maroon) dipped 22 oz. bottle, 2004 release - aged 10 months]: a nice release of CO<sub>2</sub> greets me on Christmas eveglugs of the luscious black liquid seep into my glass and build a gorgeous, fluffy brown head.  As like each of my other samples this amazing liquid coats my glass with a thick golden coat, though not quite as dark as I remember.  What I notice this time is that a full glass of this Goliath weighs about 10 pounds, amazing.  The aroma has more sweet milk chocolate than I remember and combines beautifully with dark figs, black cherries and alcohol effervescence.  Palate is missing the velvety carbonation of my last samples and though it is extremely coating, seems a bit thin.  Flavours are a bit too sweet and lacking the depth of the previous version, perhaps more time will help, but I do think the 2003 version was superior.  By the way, all of these notes deal with the first 2/3rds of the bottle which was poured into the glass all at once, the bottom third, which had the consistency of yogurt and the colour of molasses covered, caramelized shit, is completely undrinkable and a huge disappointment considering the cost of the bottle and the memories I have of the previous version.  <3.5, pushing it>

[Waxed sealed growler, 2003 version  aged over a year: Deliahs Chicago vintage beer tasting, Feb 04]: the darkly golden/black coating of the glass is still unlike any other substance on the planet.  The thick viscous qualities have settled into a subtlety, silky velvet on the tongue.  Aroma is still potent but now moves slower to the nostrils: you may believe that split second is enough time for the innocent to get away. . . but dont count on it, the Dark Lord still reigns.  <4.9>

[2003 release, draught fresh from the brewery]: A black abyss oozed from the tap on the grounds of 3 Floyds brewery. A large deep brown head rests atop the gooey liquid they call Dark Lord.  Full roasted malts provide a heavenly sweetness in just the right amounts.  All others pail in comparison. <4.8>","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
1016,"2002-11-09",4.7,"UPDATED: MAR 11, 2003 Ok, well, what a treat, indeed, it was to have this beer.  We drove to get some growlers of the Dreadnaught and the Behemouth.  We get to 3 Floyds and there is Dark Lord on tap.  What an amazing Imperial Stout.  I've called a beer thick before.  It's all water after this sucker.  It pours like a black hole out of the tap with huge, thick awesome dark brown head.  It also coats the glass the like a syrup.  If you like thick, dark, full roasted, malty Imperial Stouts, you must try this one.  I haven't had anything that closely resembles it.  Roasted malts, espresso, chocolate, dark fruit, molasses, a touch of maple syrup.  Dark Lord is the only proper name because you want to thank everything good in the world for something so incredible and oh so dark.  Get it if you can.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
