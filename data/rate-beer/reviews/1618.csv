The taste is medium sweet that finishes dry; there are notes of: melons, almonds, alcohol, and slight citrus. The palate is medium-full bodied, slightly viscous, and light acidity. Overall, tasty, but forgettable; very reasonably priced though.","Ontario, CANADA","chris__hartley"

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, slightly unclean. Medium body, watery texture, no carbonation, moderately alcoholic, lightly astringent.  A perfectly serviceable sake...the nose is pleasant with obvious fruit notes and very little of the typical glue-mold odors in most sakes at this price.

The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish with a strong alcohol burn. The strong flavor contained notes of vinous and polished rice.  A typically strong vinous alcohol based sake.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

1618,"2008-10-19",2.3,"The Diamond Junmai Ginjo from Momokawa starts with a semi-strong and flavorful fragrance.  A slight astringency with a moderate piercing strength brings out the scent of vinegared sushi rice - itself like an attractive funk Ive frequently heard described as umami.  I found it odd that you had to breathe in through your nose very, very slowly to catch the aroma, but when you did it was pronounced.  The flavor is remarkable for its coating texture with a low and sweeping astringency.  Quiet at first and then a somewhat flat, spiritless taste.  The aftertaste too is long and boozy.  There might be a slight, dry sweetness in the beginning with an exhausted pop of musk melon flavor, but its hard to find and not worth the effort.  The very first moment of the sip is also the only time when the sake approaches a fresh and ricey flavor, but this quickly buckles back down to a flat, strange, semi-bitter taste.  I hope this isnt representative of the ginjo style.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
1618,"2008-09-20",2.5,"Pours clear.  Smells clean, tropical, sugary and sweet.  The alcohol from the rice is very present and there is some sugar too.  It burns a little and is quite warming.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","Hawksfan17"

Aroma: honeydew melon, passion fruit, and mango.  Slightly metallic.

Taste: Tropical fruit with a lightly spiced finish.  Some mineral and metallic components are off putting but generally a rather nice Sake for the price.  Touches of Fuji apple.

Palate: Faintly dry.  Medium bodied. 

Overall a very good effort by the Oregon brewer.","Wisconsin, USA","Bottman"
1618,"2008-03-07",3.2,"Tallahassee, Fl. - Market Square Liquors - 750 ml blue glass bottle. A shade darker than clear pour - slight glint to it - akin to a glass of white wine. Pleasant aroma, some floral accents and a hint of alcohol. Much more refined aroma than most sakes. Clean, fresh refined flavor. Sakes are always hard to describe for me. Some coconut accents, a bit of a pina colada thing going on. Very smooth and velvety. In the upper echelons of sakes that I have had - I know there are much better ones - but not quite willing to fork out $30 for a bottle just yet.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"

1618,"2007-09-04",3.0,"Crystal clear, pale yellow color.  Smooth topcoat lacks a sheen of any sort.  The aroma shows lemons, flowers, and a bit of sweet cream.  The flavor is essentially the same, with lemon becoming a bit more assertive than it showed in the nose.  Medium body for a sake with a somewhat dry mouthfeel.  Alcohol is detectable, though not overpowering.  The palate is slightly syrupy, with a long lemon-chiffon finish.  Decent, but far from great.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Somewhat thin.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","sethdude"

1618,"2006-01-18",3.2,"Pale, clear yellow color.  Aroma is light fruits, vanilla, very light alcohol.  Nice smooth palate, medium bodied - full flavored without being viscous.  Taste is sweet - honey, vanilla, coconut.  Some other quality - I see on the label they mention granite and minerals - yeah, I guess thats what Id call it.  Finished mostly dry with some lingering sweets.  I would probably recommend this one with food as its good but not good enough to stand on its own for a whole bottle.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"

1618,"2005-01-07",3.6,"Small bottle. Figured that I would give it a try with a visit to the local Japanese establishment. My rating is not based on an educated sake palate, but what the hey. Aroma was fruity. Flavor was not too dry, but not too sweet. Seemed like a cross between a barley wine and a white wine. Went well with the food we had. Will have to try some of the many Sakes that are available...","Good Beer Bar Deprived, New Jersey, USA","MaiBockAddict"
1618,"2005-01-04",3.3,"200mL bottle.  My 2nd sake.  Hopefully this will be better than the first.  Very ethanol-like aroma.  Smells mildly of isopropyl.  Some straw/barnyard notes as well in the aroma.  Pour is transparent with no head and a mild mild yellowish twinge.  Mostly clear colored.  Ah yes, this sake is much better than my first.  Slightly thin and watery to start turning an almost astringent middle with lots of dry notes.  Finishes mildly sweet.  Alcohol is hidden nicely.  Very soft flavor that isnt too harsh.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
1618,"2004-12-08",3.1,"Light yellow appearence. Aromas of melons and mangos. Sweet alcohol and a hint of marshmellows. Flavor has a certain chocolate character as well as a fruitiness. Pleasent finish. Small alcohol bite.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Sham"
1618,"2004-04-10",2.8,"This has a very light beige tinge to it. The aroma is very earthy and dry with some light fruityness. The flavor has lots of alcohol bite and acidity.

1618,"2004-03-16",2.0,"Rating the Diamond side-by-side with the Momokawa Ruby and Pearl reveals that there isn't that much difference between Diamond and Ruby, except that Diamond is imbued with more yellowish color and some light honey flavors.  Oily mouthfeel is present, as opposed to Ruby's wateriness.  Also, Diamond is drier than Ruby, and as such is considered more premium.  But to me, dryness v. sweetness is simply a matter of personal preference - neither is better.  More alcohol burn than with the Ruby, which is a negative, but at 15% abv, I've experienced more burn than this.  The Japanese would say that because US sakeries use non-premium rice, it doesn't matter how much you grind it down (making it a ginjo or daiginjo).  I agree mostly with that premise, as I've found the US sakes don't have much complexity to their taste.  This Diamond is a respectable US effort to craft a dry US-made sake, but its flavor components are somewhat one-dimensional.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
1618,"2004-01-16",3.0,"Every pale yellow...almost clear. The aroma was full of alcohol, mineral oil, honey, and a distinct mustiness. The flavor was pretty sweet (I think there's honey here, but I'm not sure,) Some fruitiness (tangy,) and a strong alcohol burn in the aftertaste. Oily, semi-thick feel, with a clean dry finish.","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"
1618,"2004-01-16",3.0,"Clear with a faint yellow tinge. Honey, mineral oil and alcohol aroma. Initially, there is almost no flavor, just an oily feel. Then a faint alcohol, honey and olive oil flavor fade in. Very oily feel initially, but finishes dry. Very interesting. Good, but I think I like sweet sake better.","Fresno, California, USA","flutetokill"
1618,"2003-12-12",3.6,"This too, is my first sake rating, so here goes...  It served, while at room temperature, clear, light yellowish tint.  Musty, chorine, butterscotch, rubbing alcohol aroma.  Wow, I like this alot better than the first time I had sake 3 years ago.  Extremely smooth and dry, mildy fruity (peach), minty, certainly butterscotch here in the taste as well, finishes with an alcohol burn.  This was extremely enjoyable.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
1618,"2003-12-11",3.4,"First sake rating, oh boy. Coming from a beer background this is quite a challenge rating this. It's been a while since I've had sake, and I am a little suprised by how refined and subtle this really is. Served just chilled. Bottle says medium dry, I'll take its word on that. Clear as water, so the appearance rating seems a little inappropriate. Light floral, rice and a hint of butterscotch sweetness(?)in the aroma. Taste varies depending on the location of the mouth it hits, I say it tends toward the sweet side, particularly in the finish, and judging solely by this sake I would prefer something just a little more dry, though this does get more dry later in the finish. Drinkable and tastes well made.","Somerville, Massachusetts, USA","DrGonzo"
