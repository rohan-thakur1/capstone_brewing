706,"2017-06-16",4.1,"750 c&c from Cap Tap. Loud cork pop! Pours darkly ruddy with a creamy beige or light tan head. Lots of rye in the aroma. And some whisky (BYB, whiskey is supposed to be reserved for Irish Whiskey). Near full bodied. Flavor is rye, fruit, whisky, and moderately roasty malt. Heat isnt an issue for me. Dang, but it is smooth rye and whisky. Maybe a hint of astringent oak creeps through. This is deadly stuff. Quaffable perhaps. Do not drink the whole thing and drive! Not very bitter, but the rye spice (tho this rye doesnt seem all that spicy as I expected - maybe the ABV is affecting me) covers that gap. Wonderful stuff.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

706,"2017-05-12",4.3,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 11/11/2016. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby red, light copper/brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, toffee, raisin, plum, fig, date, cherry, apricot, apple, red grape, vanilla, spicy rye whiskey, toasted oak, and brown bread; with lighter notes of maple, molasses, coconut, chocolate, cocoa, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready/rye malt, fruity yeast, and rye whiskey barrel notes; with great strength. Minimal booziness in the aromas as it warms. Taste of huge caramel, brown sugar, toffee, raisin, plum, fig, date, cherry, apricot, apple, red grape, vanilla, spicy rye whiskey, toasted oak, and brown bread; with lighter notes of maple, molasses, coconut, chocolate, cocoa, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate rye/whiskey/oak spiciness and light earthy hop bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of huge caramel, brown sugar, toffee, dark fruit, cherry, apricot, apple, red grape, vanilla, spicy rye whiskey, toasted oak, brown bread, maple, coconut, light chocolate/cocoa, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/rye malt, fruity yeast, and rye whiskey barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/spiciness balance, and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light dryness from rye/whiskey/oak spiciness and carbonation, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium-plus carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is extremely well hidden; a mild increasing warmth, with zero barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged imperial rye ale. All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/rye malt, fruity yeast, and rye whiskey barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV. Pretty much perfectly balanced on all flavors, and great barrel presence without being boozy. Basically an English barleywine on flavor profile. A highly delicious offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

706,"2017-04-22",3.9,"Bottle served in a glass, 
this ale was a dark brown in the glass with some haze and particles, the pour gave almost a fingers worth of off-white cover of bubbles that lowered quickly, it left some spots and small fingers of lacing that rolled off quickly,

it had flavors of rye grain, whiskey, liquor, vanilla, caramel, toasted grain, toasted dark bread, rye spice, a bit of dark fruit (raisin and fig) in the background, there was a whiskey liquor prick with some spice bite at the finish, 

this drink felt pretty full on the mouth, there was soft to less than average carbonation and it was a little creamy on the lips, each sip gave some warmth on the mouth and throat,

Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, toffee, rye whisky, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel, toffee, vanilla, coconut, rye whisky, and wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and sticky mouthfeel.

706,"2017-03-27",3.7,"From notes. Enjoyed with Doug at his place on March 22. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a darker ruby brown with a thicker light tan head and a couple spots of lace as it falls down. The aroma is heavy rye. The spiciness is pretty huge. A light caramel malt and a light alcoholic burn on the back end. This smells like a scotch ale. The flavor is really interesting. There is a huge spiciness to it. Its sweet and lightly malty. I like the rye control to it. Its like a spicy Backwoods Bastard. The mouth feel is a little lighter and brightly carbonated with a lingering spiciness to it and a strong barrel. Its a really interesting beer.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Genuine, complex whisky notes are all over this guy with modest hopping and assertive spicy rye character. The palate is huge and alcohol burn is more than approachable as a slow sipper. Heavy whisky notes come through and not just as blunt oak or vanilla. We get mature wood flavors with a really deep rye body. Bitterness is wonderfully balanced.
