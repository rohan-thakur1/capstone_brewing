1388,"2013-03-16",3.8,"On tap U Tri Ruzi. Opaque brown black pour, intense lacing. Fruity (cherry) aroma, vanilla notes, strong roasted malt presence, pretty aromatic.

1388,"2013-03-11",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Delicate but lengthy roasted and caramel malts swing into fruity and dry before letting roastiness take control of the finish.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam covers the darkness.
-The mouthfeel is full, yet the finish is relatively dry, increasing drinkability.
-Caramel allusions make a comeback in the aftertaste.
-Like the rest of U Tri Ruzis classic stylings, this is perfectly malty from aroma to finish.
