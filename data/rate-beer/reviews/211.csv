211,"2012-08-28",3.5,"Fairly big foamy head over a somewhat hazy pale golden color. Pleasant to look at, but out of character for the style. Citrus aroma reminiscent more of a gentle APA. Citrus flavor as well, again reminiscent of an APA or even a session IPA. Bitter finish. Overall very good beer, though Im not sure its a very good Kolsh. :)","ISRAEL","ThreeCats"
