1066,"2014-07-14",3.8,"Draft on tap at the brewpub (Spring Lake, MI). Pours a pale champagne hue, a faint hazy hue with some lively bubbles. Loose ring of head dies to a tiny ring, small lacing. Aromas are touch of honey, apple and pear sweetness meet, touches of crisp green, sweet pear juice and a kiss of white grape. Faint peach, more pear, a bit of yeastiness. Clean, fruity and deep. Initial is a bit tart, lighter on the palate with pear, gentle kiss of honey, faint apple. Nice tartess and bite permeate into the middle. Some gentle white grape, a nice sour bite and bit of fuzziness hits the palate. Lively, fresh tart with a lighter body, gentle carbonation. Finish is dry, a gentle champagne yeast with touches of tartness lingering on. Tasty, light and tart. Nice stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
1066,"2014-04-30",3.7,"Bottle. Poured clear pale color with a average sparkling white head that mostly lasted with average legs. Medium to heavy green pear fruit aroma. Medium to abundant body with a smooth dry texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet pear flavor with a medium sweet fruit finish of moderate duration. This cider surpassed my expectations.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1066,"2014-04-28",3.5,"tap. Golden with small head. Very tart perry. I havent had that many, but this is by far the dryest Ive had. I miss the sweetness, but its excellent nonetheless.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"
1066,"2014-04-23",3.7,"750ml bottle, thanks to tmoney99 for sharing. Its spelled on the label as ""Bon Chretien"", with an accent over the 1st e. 2013 vintage. Totally clear, almost colorles color. Just a light yellow hue. Thin ring of off-white head. Great, lightly tart taste. Minimal sweet. Nice tartness. Good clean pear aroma, lightly spicy, good skin component. Medium-plus body. Smooth, kind of crisp, lighter carbonation. Very satisfyingly dry finish. Definitely a stand-out perry. Maybe one of the best Ive ever had.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
1066,"2014-04-23",3.7,"750 ml bottle to snifter (shared by Tmoney99). Looks good; a transparent light gold with thin white lacing. Smells solid; a very nice, well-balanced pear presence. Tastes like it smells with a tart, fairly dry mouthfeel. I like that its a tarter pear than a sweeter pear; puts it at the top of my Perry list. Would love to see this oaked.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
1066,"2014-04-21",3.8,"Draft. One of the more flavorful Perrys Ive had. Even a subtle tartneas. Dry finish.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
