3056,"2017-04-16",4.6,"Free States Old Backus is a malt bomb with lots of class. It pours brown. It has a nose that leans heavily toward toasted malt sugar - brown sugar, caramel, and cooked fruit. Caramel, molasses, butterscotch, vanilla, chocolate, stone fruits, and dark fruits make up the flavor profile. While this definitely leans more toward the English malt-forward style, you still get some zesty hops toward the finish. Gorgeous stuff.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

3056,"2016-02-12",3.8,"Sampled from a bottle, 
this ale had a hazy medium brown-rust red pour and gave almost a one finger cover of pale yellow bubbles that receded to a small ring and scattering of small islands, it left some spots of lacing on the glass, 

it had malty aromas with caramel, some bread, faint chocolate and raisin like fruit, faint citrus notes in the background with malt and light brown sugar sweetness, 

the flavors were big malt, caramel, some chocolate, a little raisin dark fruit, some light brown sugar sweetness and very faint peach fruit notes with a little imperial red notes in the background that I found to be a little odd, 
the finish had a small alcohol / citrus bitterness and trailed on the tongue for a bit, malty notes followed and clung to the mouth to give a back and forth of malt and bitterness with a tip to the malt and sweetness, 

the mouth feel was medium full, it was a little creamy and had soft to average carbonation, 

this beer was pretty mellow and easy to drink, a nice sipper of a drink.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"
3056,"2015-12-27",4.1,"thick brown color with little to no head. aroma is caramel, toffee, and light booze. Flavor is toffee, caramel, barrel, light booze, and a hint of apricot or peach. sticky mouth feel.","Kansas, USA","CopterScott"
3056,"2015-12-26",4.0,"Aroma is rather mild. Notes of sweet malt come through, but very little in the way of hops contributing to the aroma.

Appearance is what I would expect. Full disclosure, this is a first time experience with a barleywine. Dark red color and a finger and a half of head that lingers with so.e good lacing to follow.

Taste: Very interesting; first experience with a barleywine. The flavor is very well represented by the malts; hops take backseat. Fruity, tart, almost sour fruit taste comes through. Plum and general stone fruit flavors (apricot for example) that are mentioned by other reviewers I can pick up on. But very much nalt forward as I understand a barleywine can be; with the hops not overpowering the experience.

Palate: Pretty mild or low carbonation in this brew. Significant alcohol flavor does come through as an aftertaste.

Overall: This a beer very different than anything I have ever experienced. That said, it is the first ""barleywine"" that I have tasted. I was introduced to craft beer in Hays, KS at Lb. Brewing. Excellent microbrewery, but I can never recall them making a barleywine style of beer. Its a very malt forward beer with an interesting mix of sweetness and fruity tartness. Not bad, but perhaps it will become better with age?","Kansas, USA","Gunfighter"

I had some from the tap when the growler was filled and it seemed to be more of an English style than the more recent version(s) of Backus(es) that i had tried.  It has definitely mellowed over the years as well and is even an easy drinker- im gonna have to watch myself.  Dark fruits and malts dominate a complex blend with barely a hint of alcohol.  Hops are present in a bittering way that balances the barleywine sweetness (this is definitely not overly sweet) but not piney like a more recent version.  If this was ever 150 IBU like in the description, id be shocked.  Finishes smooth.  Solid beer.

2006 vintage

Merry Christmas!

The beer is a beautiful copper ruby hue. Crystal clear appearance with a thick, whipped merengue head. The head displays excellent retention and coats the pint glass with lacing. A superb appearance.

The aroma brings an array of scents, including toffee, caramel, oak, malt, booze, fruit.

The flavor Is phenomenal. Ridiculously smooth and easy to drink. This beer hides the alcohol about as well as any beer I have had. Toffee, caramel, vanilla, oak. A slight leaning toward an English style barleywine, with some candy sweetness, though never cloying. The beer is so soft and mellow, surely aided by the hands of time, yet tastes so fresh and clean. Fantastic stuff.

Perfect carbonation level. The feel is so fresh and clean on the palate. A dangerous beer, it would be easy to get ahead of myself and consume this too rapidly. Perhaps the most quaffable barleywine I have ever had.

Overall, a world class example of the style. Two pints was perfect. This is the only American barleywine that tempts me for a second serving. Highly recommended.

3056,"2012-04-20",4.2,"Big thanks to Kegatron for sharing this one with us all at Stakems Fish Fry. This growler is over a year old.

A - Pours slightly hazy dark amber with a nice one finger tall light tan head leaving thin strings of lace down parts of the glass.

S - Smells amazing right off the bat. Lots of brown sugar, caramel, toffee, butterscotch, and a bit of dark fruit at the end of each sniff.

T - Starts off with a big dose of sweetness - mostly toffee, caramel, butterscotch and a bit of molasses - slowly giving way to a bit of dark fruits and some dulled hop bitterness. Very little, if any, booze is present but there is definitely a touch of oxidation in this one but, like the booze, it never gets in the way.

M - Big body with a smooth, creamy feel with moderate carbonation. The feel works extremely well with the flavors to create an easy drinking yet potent barleywine.

O - Damn, this is one fine barleywine. I have had some great barleywines in my travels but this one is one of the best. Simply awesome stuff, hope I get to try it again some day.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
3056,"2012-03-15",3.0,"From notes.  First reviewed 2/10/2012.  Poured from a 64 oz. growler courtesy of kansascitytrader through AgentZero. Thanks for sharing guys!

The beer pours a fairly murky, flat brown color with a ruby miniscus and a small wisp of a tan head.

The aroma is harsh and boozy. The smell is heavy on the dark fruits and lighter on the caramel and brown sugar malt notes. Rum-soaked raisins, plums, and figs, with additional sugar and alcohol presence. 

The flavor is not quite so severe. The flavor starts and stays very sweet, with a little bit more balance than I was led to believe existed from the nose. Brown sugar and toffee coat the figs, raisins, and plums, but the bready malt gets lost behind a still-intense booze and oak character. The finish is fairly boozy. It has a harsh flavor, but there could be a good beer hiding behind the rough edges.

Old Backus is very light on the carbonation and the grainy nature of the beer contributes to a fairly rough feel on the palate overall.

I have definitely smelled and tasted barleywines with very rough aromas at first that have mellowed out into beautiful beers. Unfortunately, with only the opportunity to try this one fresh, it has not had any time to develop.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

A: Brackish orange-brown body, thin pale khaki head, a few stray wisps of lacing.

S: Rich caramel malts are accented by earthy notes of tobacco and leather.  Some dark fruits and citric hops in the background.

M: Medium-full bodied.  Moderate carbonation, creamy texture, with a clean, slightly bitter finish and some residual heat a few seconds later.  Nice.

O: Overall I could see why this beer gets high marks, the nose and flavor are complex... ultimately, however, I thought the creamy caramel complexion was a little out of balance and perhaps tiring.

3056,"2010-12-10",4.1,"Cant thank Dale enough for sending this growler my way.  2009 vintage I believe.

Pours pretty dark for a barleywine, a murky mahogany that shows amber around the edges with a one-inch tan head that shows decent retention and lacing for a growler pour.

The aroma is fantastic and has all kinds of things going on.  There is a dominant sweetness thats a combination of toffee, caramel and fruits.  The fruit has both plums and raisins but also a little bit of green apples and sherry.

The taste actually has more hops than I was expecting with an initial bitterness that gave way to a toffee and caramel backbone with sugar-coated dark fruits.  The finish brings back the hops and leaves a slightly roasted but bitter finish.

Mouthfeel is so smooth and close to full bodied.  Almost chewy with soft carbonation and a sweet but slightly dry finish.

I had heard good things about this but probably wasnt prepared for how really great a beer it was.  Its one of the better non-BA barleywines I can remember having.  Exceptionally complex but still remains drinkable.  Really impressive.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Poured a dark amber with a pretty good head (especially out of a growler) with good lacing. The smell was pretty intense and complex, including caramel malt, toffee sweetness, hints of vanilla, some dark fruits, and a bit of alcohol. The taste is quite similar, with a beautiful malt sweetness coming through in addition to the characteristics of the nose. Very nice mid-to-full-bodied mouthfeel with good carbonation and outstanding drinkability for a beer of this size and complexity.

3056,"2008-10-19",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2011 2006 on tap @ the brewpub, 2 years old.  Multiple snifter fills.  The color is murky reddish brown, sometimes pours with a small but lasting head, other times no head.  Aroma is is strong with sweet, malty, raisin bread with strong notes of rummy black bread.  Not strong on hops but I have been told when fresh this is extremely hoppy. Its not over the top on the nose but its still strong. Taste is thick with light fruitiness (in a good way, not astringent or anything), thick maltiness, with some faint roast that works well, and a lightly bitter rosy rum.  Alcohol there but works well with the bigness of the beer, does not stick out much.  Mouthfeel is very full yet not dead.  Just a bit of burn down the throat on the first sip. Velvet-y feel on the cheeks. I kept drinking it, so I guess I liked it a lot.  Stands up to the hype.Had some 2002 at the Anniversary party in 2011.  Very strong cardboard present.

How: Hand-bottle from mreush.  Drank a week after receiving them.  Thanks a lot Matt for this rare kick-ass beer!!!
The look: Dark brown body with a small beige head
In long: Fantastic body, extra-full, somewhat viscous, barley-candy, appropriate medium carbonation. This is one dirty sick barley wine.  Flavour wise there is a lot going into that beer, decadent caramel, figs, earthy tree barks, cigar leaves, dates, earthy tree roots, rather vinous, brown sugar and even more.   Alcohol is never distracting.  The beer is a lot more complex than it is intense, and thats a good thing.  This is an almost perfect digestive beer. Smooth and decadent.

Appears a dark opaque brown with crimson highlights. Small bubbles slowly rise to the top of the glass. A small, light tan cap fades into a mild film and hearty collar of batter-like bubbles. Scattered streaks of lacing are left around the glass.
Smell is of heavy malt, raisins, toffee, cocoa, figs, tobacco, brown sugar, caramel, vanilla, sugar cookies, ripened dark fruits, mild hints of black cherries. This is what Ive been craving.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a sugary blend of fruit, raisins, vanilla, and an array of gourmet cocoa, molasses, and toasted nuts. Hot damn! This is a definite winner that Im proud to say Ive had the pleasure of drinking.
Mouthfeel is full bodied, chewy, smooth, mildly fruity, creamy, syrupy, with a touch of heat and rum soaked raisins lingering along the palate.

Not quite sure about that, but the malts and the hops blend quite seamlessly on the tongue for sure. Spicy hops and chewy,  sticky sweet malt mingle quite nicely. A pleasant tartness abounds on the backside. Almost like red grape skin tannin. This is a most unique barley wine for sure. Leaning toward full bodied.

Poured deep plum-accented brown with a fleeting beige head that is easily resurrected.  The aroma picked up an interesting array of fresh herbal and grassy hoppage over a seductive sweet base comprised of plums, aged caramel, and brown sugar.. warm, yet alcohol never becomes more than a supporting/strengthening factor.. overall this was green, but still awesome!  The flavor did not dissapoint.. warm caramel and an array of dark fruits wash over the tip of the tongue, again with greener hops (grassy and floral primarily) making a major showing.. grainy dark fruits take up most of the middle and carry through the finish.. caramel and chocolate add support on the back-end.. alcohol provides warmth and amplification, but no more than it should at this ABV.  Lower carbonation and a heavier body on the palate..  grainy on the middle with a warm, bitter, satisfying finish.. flowed decently.

3056,"2007-12-27",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 21, 2008 Original Rating: 07 Vintage, on tap at the brewpub. Ah, Old Backus...at last we meet. Pours a deep, chocolate brown, with a ruby hue, and a creamy, light tan head. On the nose are plums, brown sugar, biscuity malt, fruity hops and alcohol. Medium to full-bodied and slick with fine, yet assertive (almost prickly) carbonation, the palate segues into a dry, hoppy, bitter finish. The flavor is of big, malty, sweet caramelized brown sugar and dark overripe plums with a conclusion that features solid alcohol warmth, a dry Popsicle-stick woodiness and a significant hop bite. I am not generally someone that likes hoppy barley wines, and this one certainly brings the goods with 150 ibu. But unlike fresh Bigfoot, which I find a bit ""rough"", this youngster is quite tasty. I think that given a year or so to mellow, this will be an amazing barley wine. Fresh, its just merely exceptional. :) Original #s: 8/5/8/4/16=4.1
 If you enjoy hoppy barley wines, this is certainly one worth seeking out while its still young. If not, Id recommend waiting for when they bring out one of the older vintages.Rerate from 3/22/08; 06 Vintage, on tap at the brewpub Pours burgundy brown with a thin, creamy, off-white head and nice lace. the nose is of roasty raisins, dark fruit and brown sugar with mild, spicy hops in the background. Medium bodied and oily-slick with a bitter hopped finish. An additional year of time to mellow has improved the palate from good to great. The flavor is a nice blend of dark fruit, some brown sugar and spicy/piny hops (much like the nose). Sweeter, better integrated across the flavor profile and the palate and more ""mellow than the 07 (which I sampled a few months back), this brew only seems to improve with age, and it is pretty impressive when fresh.

This is a barleywine that others should be judged by; highly recommended!","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"
3056,"2006-05-18",4.2,"Murky brownish with a hint of orange. A skim of creamy head. Aroma is beautiful. It reminds me of Haines Bigger Hammer Barley Wine. Smells wonderful. Sweet malt, awesome hop presence, not citrusy, not extreme, just a nice spicy hint in the aroma. Im excited to taste. Mmm.... so malty, very flavorful. The malts are very caramel and a bit fruity, and the hops bring a good resinous texture and a bit of a hint of citrus on the finish. I like how this feels aged. The hops are definitely there keeping it bitter, but not extreme. Its a great balance. Thanks to Doppelganger  for leaving it with me. As far as barleywines go, this is a good, balanced one for my palate. The only thing I find I wish would be in there is more of the dried fruit flavors. I like that in a barleywine. A great one for #200","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","alaskanwarren"

Flavor started out a little rough. Quite a bit of bitterness, a lot of sweet. But halfway through the glass things just seemed to click. Maybe it needs to be warmer and have the even modest level of carbonation dissapated. At any rate, the last half of the glass was great. Leathery dried fruit, smooth port like sweetness, a bit of tartness to clean up the finish. A barleywine that kind of snuck up on me, and I dig it.","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"

Although the aroma was very promising, with some unique hempy bitterness, the flavor was quite flat and not reminiscent of barleywine at all. Its almost as if they poured the wrong beer. It didnt taste 10.5% at all. The trademark rich complexity of a barleywine was just not there. It was a reasonably quaffable brew with some roasted malt, and that hempy bitterness, but I never would have guessed it was a barleywine.

Surprisingly well contained alcohol despite the vaporous notes in the aroma. It just comes out as what it is, a malt monster, beefy and intimidating with rich sweetness.

This beer decants from a 16 oz Grolsch swing-top bottle, a dark chestnut brown, murky and highly unfiltered.  Cinnamon and deep ruby hues swirl about as a cream colored head fades to whispy clumps of bubbles.  The nose takes in a large scent of dark concord grapes, strongly phenolic yeast and a smooth, lush oiliness that just seeps off of the beer.  Whereas the Owd Macs was decidedly British in style, this barleywine strikes a powerfully hoppy note immediately.  All thoughts of this being a malty English Barleywine vanish.  Before even contemplating the flavor, I am struck with how smooth, full and oily the body is.  No traces of wateriness, as seen in the Owd Macs, and this is supposed to be one year older!  The hops from the aroma do not disappoint, this starts out highly bitter, large doses of American hops bombard the palate, and a sticky, resinous caramel malt provides the much needed backup.  Having just read the commercial description, I can personally vouch for the IBU claim.  This stuff is hoppy!!  But lightly tart red fruit notes, as well as a strong vinousness, light notes of vinegar and prunes all combine in the complex flavor.  Sticky, hugely viscous and thick, this beer is a study in full flavor.  Towards the finish, it ends on a more dry barley and dry toffee note.  Bitterness lingers long, but the flavor coats your mouth.   Thank you so much for this, Chris, this was truly a wonderful and unique beer (though the hops are too dominant yet, and this needs more time in the cellar).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3056,"2005-01-01",4.3,"Hand bottled by csbosox(grolsch style) Thanks man! 03 vintage. Small tan head, fair retention, minimal lacing. Hazy, dark brown color. Big fruity nose, hints of raisins and sweet malts, lightly roasty, gorgeous! Med/full bodied, delicate creamy texture, great mouthfeel. Juicy malt and hop flavors. Big fruityness, caramel mallts and some chocolate malts with an  interesting roastiness also. A seriously complex brew, need more to get the full effect, hmmmmmm.Finish is medium dry, fruity and lightly roasty. One of the best all around B-wines i,ve had in awhile.

3056,"2004-12-30",4.2,"Deep, murky, port-like.  No head.  Syrupy, grapy, alcohol aroma--positively heady.  Some slight solvent-like stuff in there as well.  Taste--Wow!

3056,"2004-12-18",3.8,"Thanks again to csbosox for sending and Springslicker for sharing. Cloudy brown, some bubbles, but no real head. Aroma of alcohol and port, maybe some cognac as well.

3056,"2004-12-18",4.0,"Thanks to csbosox for the chance to try these excellent Free State beers!
Bottled from a growler.
This poured with a bit of fizz that really didnt produce a head, maybe a ring of foam around the edge or the glass.
The chestnut color was a bit hazy.
I sampled this twice actually, with a few hours apart to clear my palate.
The aromas are complex. Big caramel, nuts, fruit, alcohol. The two Free State beers I had today both had extremely nice aromas and if you cant get a chance to drink one, you should at least get to smell one!
This has a touch of sweetness tempered nicely with a drying hop presence, like a bigger, bader (better) version of a Bigfoot that has been aged for years to mellow everything out. Excellent balance. A very enjoyable sipper.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"
3056,"2004-12-08",4.7,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2008 Deep red, madeira-like color. Head subsides almost immeadiately. Served in an ~8oz snifter.  KILLER aroma. Malt, sweet, raisin? Flavor is malty, sweet, complex, almost like cognac. Hops are apparent in the floral/fruity flavor but the beer is not bitter. It is balanced. With the sheer amount of malt, it took a lot of hops to balance it. This is beer? It seems like so much more.  The manager told me this was the 03.  
RERATE March 07 (1999 Vintage) This is bottled from a growler(I did the handbottling). It is a 12oz bottle with just about 1"" of headspace. Served in my NB snifter. Surprisingly, it poured with a nice, though short-lived, cream colored head. The color is dark orange brown. The aroma is alcohol, overripe dark fruits, cocoa, toffee, oak, vanilla extract laden sugar cookie dough, and a nice, subtle oxidation fitting for a beer 8 years old. The initial taste is huge malt, brown sugar, spice, light warming alcohol, and oak followed by a thick-bodied (despite the low carbonation level) bruiser of a beer, all braggadocio and swagger but getting a little long in the tooth. The main flavors meld so completely into one another that it is just a lovely meld of all the flavors, an earthy, mildly boozy, sweet caramel, and spicy combination. The finish is cleaned up by the alcohol, which does its job well, but is still harmonious. This is a great example of one of my favorite barleywines, which may have some age on it, but still has a lot of life-hops and alcohol do have a preservative effect. Score stays the same, it is hard to improve on a 4.7 beer, but make no mistakes, this is not the same beer as it is when young, the somewhat brash hoppy barleywine turns into a regal older gentleman with 8 years on it. A punk rock grandfather?","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"
3056,"2004-10-09",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 18, 2007 2003 vintage put in a growler at the brewpub at the beginning of April 07 and sampled on 4/18/07: Pours a slightly carbonated hazy copper brown with a thin ring of light tan head.  Aroma of sweet dark caramel with complex aged malty flavor and a touch of brown sugar.  Body starts pretty full, sticky and viscous with a touch of raisin complexity and mild earthy tartness.  Seems to have aged pretty well.

GABF 2004: Hazy copper golden color with a thin tan head.  Beautiful, rich toffee and caramel malty aroma is very pleasantly and subtly hopped.  Starts intensely thick and sweet but not overpowering with a touch of aged English barleywine character.  Even reminded me a bit of J.W. Lees Harvest Ale, just with more balance.  Finishes semi-dry and bittersweet with no noticeable alcohol.  A very nice barleywine.  This brewery makes some killer beers.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3056,"2004-10-08",4.5,"GABF 2004.  I couldnt wait to get to the Free State table.  Id never had any of their beers so you bet I was ready.  This barley wine is awesome, plain and simple.  This ale  pours with an opaque, deep brown body topped by a nice thick, off white head  that dissipates quickly....with tons of lacing gracing the glass. The nose is of sweet malts, fruity with a bit more than a hint of alcohol. The flavor is sweet and fruity with notes of molasses and a very slight touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is thick/syrupy, but not what I would call chewy.  The finish is slightly sweet yet adds a nice hop bitterness that fades nicely.  One of my festival favorites for sure.  Free State ales almost make me want to move to Kansas.....well, almost.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BrockLanders"
3056,"2004-10-08",3.5,"GABF 2004. Body is hazy medium amber. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted bread, cookie), moderately hoppy (orange, apricot, resin), with notes of sherry and alcohol. Flavor is heavily sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, syrupy texture, soft carbonation, moderately alcoholic. A little too aged for me, I think (sherryish), and not the sort of aromatic profile that had me pining for more after 2 or 3 samples.  Im a hard sell on barleywines, whether British or American, and although this does have some nice characters, it doesnt have what I look for.  The malt character was pretty nice, though.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3056,"2004-10-04",4.3,"My second favorite barley wine at GABF. The biggest flavors were caramel and toffee. Not too sweet and real drinkable. Mellow hop bite levels it out. Dangerous stuff.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
3056,"2004-10-04",4.4,"Another winner from Free State.  This is the first barley wine that I have had in quite a while, after burning out on the style.  And it is a good one.  It is very British tasting, and reminded me of a stronger Old Nick.  Good job of staying away from the ""dump a bucket of hops in"" trend.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
3056,"2004-10-03",4.1,"GABF 2004. Flat pour with a slightly hazy, iced tea colored body. Brown sugar, molasses, fruit and alcohol properties in the nose. Woody, light hop notes. Same properties come through in the flavor plus a rich nuttiness. Considerable sweetness that, although well-counterbalanced by hops, detracted slightly for me. Reminds me of Solstice dHiver from Dieu du Ciel but less elegant in my book.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
3056,"2004-10-03",4.4,"GABF2004... 2001 Poured a cloudy pinkish brown color with a thin off white head.  Aroma was fruit, oranges, and piney hops.  Sweet with light fruits, vanilla and light alcohol.  Very nice.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"

Very rocky head dissipates quickly, thick-looking, viscous and almost syrupy body and a light, uneven murky haze.  Huge, absolutely delicious sweet caramel nose, standing up among the best of the barley wines out there.  Initial taste reveals a surprising simultaneously cool and bold blanket of bright caramel and soggy hops.  An amazing huge, sharp bite with a dry snip to it from the hops.  Fruity and rich, like prunes made into a puree with liquid brown sugar.  Extremely long finish of caramel and toffee, a lingering light toastiness joinging the fray for the long haul.  Simply fantastic.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"
3056,"2004-02-16",4.4,"Very complex beer that is developing some sherry and plum notes to go along with huge malt and hop profile.

3056,"2003-10-26",4.6,"99 vintage; Cask-conditioned:  Ruddy brick. Lethargic carbonation. Thick and velvety caramel head.  Luscious, tangy aroma of sherry, plummy sweet malts, black cherry skin, leather, and cedar.  Tropical fruit undertones with a mere sign of alcohol, wood, and crystal malts.  The malts have turned exquisitely mushy from the extensive aging.  Mellow carbonation.  Decadently massive,  chewy body.  Mesmerizing blend of chewy musty malts.  Finishes with a sherryish twang with little sign of the 10.5% and a hint of vanilla.  After four years aging, the hop structure remains more than capable, enhancing the candied malt richness.

3056,"2002-11-22",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 10, 2003 I must say...this is not my favorite style of beer. That being said, this stuff smelled DELICIOUS. I kept smelling and smelling. Looks like cloudy tea. Lots of great flavors going on here...cidery, fruity, even a little spice. I just dont really like beer that is so overpoweringly sweet; however I think that is just a characteristic of the style. I may re-rate after I try other barley wines. RERATE; 1/10/02. Ive had a little more experience with the style now, and this beer is special in its own way. Compared to English-style barley wines that Ive had, this isnt really that sweet; it is actually really balanced (150 IBU!). Mouthfeel is very creamy, and the beer reminds me of pecan pie for some reason. This is an absolutely gorgeous-looking beer, my friends; in fact, Ive never seen a better looking beer.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","grant"

3056,"2002-03-08",4.6,"I am completely amending my rating for this beer as of today, having taken proper notes and having decided that it would be worth the effort to give readers some idea of what this beer is like.  Note: the brewers description above is actually for the 1997 version, the Barleywine I tried was the 1999 version, which differs just slightly.  First of all, this beer is hugely aromatic.  Medicine, alcohol, fruit and hops all overpower you at once.  This beer has no effervescence, but a nice, even head with very small bubbles.  It is unfiltered, with a dark, cloudy amber color, a bit like fresh cider, and it is served in a brandy snifter at cellar temperature, approx. 55 F.  The flavor consists of varying degrees of caramel and lightly toasted malts, but also huge, flowery hop flavors.  This beer is very complex, and your lips tend to stick to the glass.  I was able to get some data on this beer from the bartender -- 28.75 P, 1150 O.G.  Alcohol is 10% by vol., with 65 IBUs.  Ingredients used in the 1999 batch included Pale Ale and Biscuit malts, with Ahtahnum hops for finishing and dry hopping, and Horizon hops for finishing as well.  The mouthfeel of the beer is most certainly quite chewy, and it leaves a bittersweet, hoppy aftertaste (apple butter??).  Overall, this is a classic and very well-done rendition of a Barleywine.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
