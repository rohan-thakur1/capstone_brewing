3175,"2006-01-26",2.5,"Im assuming this is the on i had, the picture matches the botle. an okay sake not too bad
a could sense a nutty aroma to it it was rather mild.  some alcohol and rice on the flavor It was rather sweet.  wouldnt cal this dry in anyway.  not a bad sake bu no to great it tasted better cold.  when it got to room temp it taste almost dirty.","New York, USA","crazyvin"

3175,"2005-01-26",1.9,"Maybe Im just not knowledgeable enough whre sake is concerned ... or maybe I just havent had the good stuff. Had Gekkeikan last night, served warm. I nursed it and it seems the first few sips were pretty good, all ricey and what-not. But by the end of the cup, it was tasting more and more like pure alcohol. I poured the last little bit out. Wont be buying it again.","Cullman, Alabama, USA","RichJ7"
3175,"2004-11-15",2.0,"This tastes too much like alcohol. It seems to me cheap and unworthy of my time and money. It is nice to your throat all warm going down though, especially if youre sick or getting sick.","Birmingham, Alabama, USA","DerBiermeister"
3175,"2004-10-18",2.6,"Clear...mild nutty aroma (very mild)...mildly sweet with a dry mild alcohol finish...good I guess...","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"
3175,"2004-10-18",3.5,"Nutty hazlenut, almond aroma, nice effervescence.  Dry.  Not especially viscuous.  A bit of burn but the lower alcohol seems apparent.  Clear water color.  I know this is supposed to be cheap sake but I find these things rather enjoyable.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
3175,"2004-08-27",2.6,"Looks like water with a twinge of green to it. Nose is like cheap vodka. The taste up front is not good-it is almost all alcohol. The back end is a diffrent story-apple/pear with some sweet alcohol flavor. Interesting. This isnt bad, but I wouldnt drink it on a regular basis.","Carrollton, Texas, USA","Lumpy"
3175,"2004-08-27",1.6,"looks like water smells like alcohol and and slight fruit, or rice would be my guess if i was a hundred percent on the aroma of rice.  has a strong bite to it. very watered down flavor of vodka. hint of sweetness that is covered by the alcohol.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
