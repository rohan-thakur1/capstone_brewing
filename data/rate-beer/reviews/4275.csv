4275,"2016-12-27",3.9,"500 ml bottle bought at Running Beers booth at HKCEC in Wan Chai during The 14th Hong Kong Food Festival.
Looks: Clear golden yellow colour; Two-finger head with crumpety white foam which lasts for 3 minutes; Excellent sticky lacing with fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant full lager malt, with moderate chopped bacon, light honey, strong floral, molasses, thick bread, fair lemon and strong grass.

Taste: Mid to light sweet lager malt, with light bacon, light ash, strong floral, molasses, strong herbs, strong dough, lemon, close to strong bitter hops and strong grass.

Body: Mid to light body; Dry, crisp and very slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Full lager maltyness in a solid background, very slick and smooth. Bacon smokiness and ash is a lot less potent than other Schlenkerlas smoked beer proper, but still tasty and notable. Strong herbal floral with moderate molasses. Very doughty with strong lemon to round. Very nice!

Hoppiness: Strong floral, fair lemon and strong grass in nose. Strong herbs, strong floral, lemon and strong grass in taste; Bitterness is strong for a lasting, close to high astringent herbal malty finish.

After Taste: Dry. Very hoppy and bitter to mouth.

Comments: This one has the Schlenkerlas rauchbier influence, the smoky, well-cooked bacon comes as a fairly light touch. Its rich doughty malt and very herbal grassy hoppiness make it a truly special Helles. Highly recommended!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

 Kolor:  Słomkowy, wpadający w żółty.
Piwo jest całkowicie klarowne. 
 Piana:  Biała, kremowa, dość puszysta.
Pieni się mocno, ale opada szybko do chmurki.
Na koniec pozostaje średnia obrączka.
Lacing na szkle całkiem niezły. 
 Zapach:  Jest dokładnie tak jakbym czytał podręcznik BJCP.
Czysty słodowy, przyjemny aromat. Trochę ciasteczek, trochę zboża, trochę chleba.
Jest wyraźny zapach słodu pilzneńskiego.
W tle coś na kształt lekkiego DMS (bardzo łatwo się pomylić), ale w tym stylu to dopuszczalne, bo ten aromat wynika z tego właśnie słodu.
W dalszej perspektywie muśnięcie wędzonki.
 Smak:  Genialny, czyściutki, gładki.
Wyraźna chlebowa nuta wsparta ciasteczkami i przypieczoną skórką.

Nose has thin sweet and a flowery dimension that connects in my mid-brain immediately as chrysanthemum tea. There is also straw, like the aroma of a Japanese room with tatami.

Mouthfeel is watery and reinforces the impression of chrysanthemum tea. Palate is thin and sweet and pale malt all the way with water biscuit, wheat dough and pale honey. There is a hint of smoke in mid palate and not unpleasant. Hops are lightly bitter and well-balanced.

It is true that the light smokiness obscures the normal characteristic flavors of a German lager, but Im OK with that.

4275,"2015-09-18",3.8,"500 ml bottle from Beervana, labeled Helles Schlenkerla Lagerbier. Thank you, Naty, my love. Pours a clear golden color with a medium white head that diminishes slowly and laces well. Soft malty and grainy aromas with fine noble hops. Notes of cereal, dough, biscuit, grassy hops, white bread and soft wood. Only with some warming I get a soft hint of smoke. It finely compliments the aroma of a refined Helles. Taste is pretty full for the style. The very soft and elegant herbal bitterness balanced out by a neutral semi-sweet dough taste. Malt dominated but hops neither absent nor timid at all. Somewhat bitter finish and aftertaste. Light to medium body, refreshing, lively carbonated. Incredibly Moreish! This one is a very elegant, refined, top of the line Helles.

4275,"2015-03-18",3.9,"Pours a clear amber, slightly darker than golden. Normal head volume, lacing and retention.

Light nose that is slightly sweet biscuit. Underneath is a subtle smokiness that is more campfire like in nature rather than bacon.

Light medium bodied, barely, with a texture that approaches smooth. Above normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a nice prickly burst in the finish.

The outstanding flavor profile is intense, a bit complex and very well balanced. It begins with a mixture of flavors that slowly separate into a mild oak like smokiness over a subtle sweet biscuit. In the middle, it becomes rather crisp and becomes dryer towards the finish. A slightly bitter smokiness lingers.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

S: Herbal hop scent with almost no maltiness and just the slightest hint of smoke. Very subtle though the very cold temp. may be stifling the aroma.
T: Oh yeah, theres the smoke!. Tastes like a very nice though typical pils or helles with sharp sour bread notes and mild hoppy flavors on the short dry finish. Crisp and refreshing. Very nice! Bonus: doesnt taste like someone dropped a fucking cigarette in it (looking at you. Marzen).

Light sweet grains, honey sweet, tad corn sweet, clean, touch more sweet than crisp, sugar, finish has a faint note of smoke that quickly seems to disappear from the picture, making a minor reassurance from time to time but you have to really look for it. Faintly grainy, oily lager body. Crazily easy to drink. It is good for what it is but I might had too high expectations considering that this is Schlenkerla after all. I have to say by the end of the bottle I found myself wishing that I had another one. At a good price point if available locally to me, I can see myself drinking a lot of it.

Requires hearty Franconian/Bavarian food to be enjoyed thoroughly and make sense. // Rerate several bottles 2015: Who am I kidding, this Lager is smooth, world class, oozing with local character masked as modesty and with 4,3% as sessionable as beers can get.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

Very lightly balanced sweetness  is followed by a little bit of a hop bite and a nice light smokiness at the end. Lively and light-bodied, the whole beer is just slightly rough at the end with the smoked elements.

The beer is light and smooth, with a balance of smoke and German lager flavors. Exactly what I would expect from this brewery.

I could easily drink a liter or more of this. Refreshing and flavorful. Well done.

Bigger emphasis on the base beer character, with Cheerios-esque malts and a  lightly sweet, grainy finish. There is a vague note of woody smoke throughout but its never at the fore.

Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle into a pint glass. 

Appearance: Poured clear light gold with a 2 finger snow white head. Nice lacing.

Smell: Lager yeast and malt with a nice smoky background.

Pours a light straw color with a thin white head and not too much lacing, even after a good swirl to raise the head back up. The nose brings a good amount of smoke along with mild lager characteristics lingering in the background. The smoke definitely overwhelms the lager, which which basically just means a lightly-smoked carbonated beverage. This creates problems for both the nose and the taste. The feel is redeemed is the Helles crispness is still there and fits well with the smoke. Fairly good, but not my favorite of theirs.

4275,"2011-02-11",4.8,"After having the Rauchbier and thinking it was ok but not something I would buy again, this one intrigued me, perhaps it would be the right balance of smokiness, here it goes.

Poured into a 0.4 liter mug/Stange hybrid for export lager, it will do until I get a good Bavarian crystal mug. It has a nice white one finger head. The color is amazing, it is nice darker helles color with a tiny bit of haze, almost like a Dortmunder, with a nice amount of bubbles. Very nice lacing as well.

Alot of people got bacon scent in the original Rauchbier Maerzen, but all I smelt was burnt wood, this one smells a bit more like bacon, especially when I popped it open and i got a huge bacon whiff. After the pour the smokiness/bacon dies down and it is a nice malty sweet smell with some breadiness. I am also getting a slight bit of hops that blends with the smoke scent.

Wow great taste woweee. Starts off quite sweet with the malts, and they last quite a bit, its a long flavor. Hops come in with a smoky bite, some spice, and some citrus flavors. The lingering flavor is smoke and hops, it has a slightly dry finish. A very complex and satisfying taste. The carbonation is perfect, has a nice bite on the tongue. This almost reminds me of a Dortumunder Export with smokiness and some Bavarian Helles charm, I guess I picked the right glass too then hah.

As it warms the smokiness on the palate intensifies but it never gets to the slightly offensive levels the Maerzen got too. The drinkablity is pretty high but I probably couldnt down more than 2 of these big bottles. The 4.30% abv makes me think a couple of liters of this would be feasible, if only this were in the mini-kegs they sell here and not the Maerzen.

This was a lovely surprise, this beer is just packed with flavor, but it isnt a big, bulky brew just light and flavorful. They ave succeed in creating a whopper of a low abv beer that I would stack up against many big beers. If you want a reprieve from your everyday Bavarian Helles this is the way to go.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

i do get a hint of smoke in here, but theres not enough malt character for the smoke to grab onto, it seems disembodies or lost. the aftertaste has a rubber note.

Aroma has a slightly acrid touch of smoke, like your clothes when you wake up in a dew-dampened tent after sitting by a campfire half the night. There is a notable, yet restrained, minerality that is sharped by the smokey character. The pilsner malt comes through pretty clear, but the hops give just a hint of herbal presence.

The beer isnt especially convincing as a Helles, with not quite enough liveliness or body, nor even a particularly flavorful quality to it.

Aroma is smoke, grass, lemon, sweet grain, lightly toasted grain, a little soured malt and a touch of floury bread rolls. Flavor is like smoked granola, or something right away-smokey, slightly sweet and grainy-very nice, lightly roasted nuts, some biscuit and bread notes, grilled vegetables - in a good way - definite mineral notes and apple peel near the finish. Finish is campfire biscuits, grass and lightly bitter hops, with a crisp mineral fade that cleans the palate of smoke notes before they become stagnate. Palate is light bodied with a light yet slightly sharp carbonation and a dry that borders beween dry and slightly oily.

4275,"2009-08-06",3.6,"8/06/2009:  Schlenkerla Helles Lagerbier...  Aroma:  Fruity lager and lightly sweet cereal grains paired with a delicate campfire smokiness.   Appearance:  Dusty golden color, cloudy; white foamy head; extremely vigorous torrents of carbonation that actively stirs the beer around the glass; the extremely fine carbonation bubbles sparkle in the lacing as it slowly slides down the glass.  Flavor:  Lots of good, deep campfire smoke and some suggestions of smoked meatiness that both permeate the fruity lager, biscuity malt, and crisp grassy hoppiness of the base beer; mild bitterness.  Palate:  Light to medium-light body, soft mouthfeel, creamy texture.  Overall:  This is just one of those beers that is simply fantastic for what it is.  Low alcohol, but very flavorful and different...  I could drink this stuff non-stop for days, weeks, maybe even months on end and never get sick of it.  I could always use more of that great Schlenkerla smokiness that I love so much, but for what this beer is and how they make it (no smoked malt, they just brew a lager and using their equipment and the beer picks up the residual smoke from equipment!), its just right.

A touch of winter spices as the beer sits. If you really swirl up the beer you can get some bacon notes. Once tasted the light malt (pils) and smooth smoke struggle with eachother for dominance, resulting in a beautiful dance. As these two fight it out, earthy hops start to crowd around and eventually over take the two dancers. Quite a nice sequence of events. Medium mouthfeel running to light at the end. Nice and dry.

It has the balance of a german pils with the smoke offsetting the sweet pils malt instead of strong hop bitterness and flavor. There is a gentle floral note in the aroma.

Smell: Sweetish honey and toffee maltiness with only a background, though still obviously present note of smoke.

Taste: Sweet maltiness, perhaps a pinch of crisp pilsner malt, along with flavors of toffee and clover honey. Hint of biscuits, maybe a bit of ripe peach fruitiness. Mild, spicy hops and bitterness along with the very restrained smoke character assist to balance the sweetness. Finishes crisp with a remaining light blend of smoke and sweetness.

Unlike some of the other beers from this line, the smoked meat taste is not overpowering, but rather youre left with some smoky honey notes.

How: Bottle 500ml, fresh (drank as soon as we got it through private importation)
The look: Clear blonde body with a little white head
In long: Typical Helles lager yeast (egg white to me), inexpressive cereals, a somewhat oily body and quite a bit of smoke.  Undisturbed by the expressive maltiness of other Schlenkerla products I thought the smoke here was really pure smoke of dry wood/paper burning.  As little as I have to say about the taste (it is a very simple beer) I found myself wanting a lot more than the lonely 500ml that I had, so thats a good sign.  Highly drinkable.  A lot more smoked than I expected since I was told that this one doesnt used smoked malts and the smoke only comes from the residues of other Schlenkerla beers.

Pours a translucent golden with sudsy white head that dissipates to a ring. Strong aroma for the style, which is biscuit. bread, and european hops. Flavor as lots of biscuit and grass that transitions to a european hop (noble?) finish, with some hard water/ mineral notes.  The smoke is subtle on my palate, as I only catch it at the back of the mouth before it goes down. As it warms, you can pickup a little more. My wife picked up tons of smoke on the first sip. Perhaps I am becoming accustomed to smoke in beers or my receptors are not as sensitive.

The taste was weak, watery with slight Saaz and Hallertau hops, and some sweet honey/caramel (which became more prominent in the finish). Some smokiness in the finish too, albeit very slight - especially for Schlenkerla standards. After drinking 3/4 of this beer I was missing the smokiness so much that I threw some Laphroaig whisky in the glass - ahh, that peatiness is more like Id expect from Schlenkerla!

I missed the smokiness in the first few sips, its got a bit of honey sweetness to it. After that the smoke takes hold, its more subtle than the other schlenkerla beers, but very noticeable in this more delicate style. When the smoke clears, the body emerges a little bit on the thin side, and hints of plastic linger. I think this has some interesting food and beer pairing potential, more so than their other brews.

To my palate, this beer tastes meaty, which is not entirely a bad thing but does make the beer a bit less drinkable than some other styles.  This beer tasted a bit like summer sausage, in contrast to the Rauchbier Marzen by this same brewer which tasted very bacon-y.  Definitely worth a try, but not something youre going to drink more than one of!  Also, if there was ever a thread on this site for ""worst lawnmower beer,"" this might be in contention.

Lengthy dry refreshing finish. This is unlike any other smoked beer that Ive had, and certainly not typical of the beers of Bamberg, which I have had first hand. It is much lighter, and although apparently no smoked malt is used, the smokiness resident in the brewery certainly characterizes this beer.

The smoke is still in the forefront of the flavor, but a little lighter than the Marzen and Urbbock beers.  Kind of an unusual style to be smoked, the more I drank, the more the Helles flavor became apparent.  Lots of hay and doughy malt and a little hoppy bitterness on the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a moderate level of fizzy carbonation.  Nice full round texture.  Pretty darn good, but not my favorite from them.

More than a hint of smokyness comes across in the aroma, though it is quite tame as compared to other Heller-Trum offerings.  Plump, bready malts and earthy noble hops round out the simple, but inviting and clean, aroma.  Early in the flavor a delicate honey on toasted bread sweetness comes across, fading into a slightly sulfurous mid-palate and finally exposing crisp hops at the finish.  A smoky, charred flavor develops in reverse--starting at the far back of the tongue, migrating forward after each sip with a retronasal experience akin to exhaling after taking a big wiff of expertly prepared smoked prime rib.  The mouthfeel is sturdy, appropriate for the flavor levels, with a very smooth texture.  Carbonation could be a touch brisker, though.  Well played and intriguing, but it lacks the radiance of a great golden lager and the oomph of a full-on smoke beer by trying to be somewhere in the middle of the two.  500mL bottle, Burgundy glass.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

4275,"2006-06-17",3.3,"UPDATED: JUN 20, 2006 Any first impressions?
-A veil of head disappears into the pale yellow clarity.
-A timid aroma produces a slight hop accent, and mild wooden smoke.
-A rising herbal, leafy hop flavor buries the smoke residue.
-A very lean maltiness creates an aqueous mouthfeel aimed at long sessions.

What if you dig deeper?
-The herbal hop bitterness is proficient and moreover very pleasant.
-My bottle doesnt have much smoked character to it, with reason, since there is no smoked malt at all in here!
-Maltiness is quite underwhelming, and not nearly as well-developed as most basic Franconian lagerbiers Ive had over there.

Bottle bought at the brewery; best before August 06.

A second bottle, bought in the US recently, produced more smoke in the aroma and flavor, thus hinting this time at a smoked lager.

Flavor, however was awesome, a nice helles / pilsner flavor with the low grassy hops also in the profile. However, the aftertaste had a firm hint of smoke in it, nothing like their other brews, very subtle in that sense, but man, just a very nicely done smoking for a ""helles"" or light lager beer. Mouthfeel was light, refreshing, and carbonated. Good stuff!!!","","User37895"

What we have is a skillfully crafted Helles featuring a crisp hoppy flavor and a strong malt presence.

Begins with a bright golden, crystal clear color with a creamy 2 fingered head. Aroma has a touch of charred wood. Flavor is more smoke, with some rounded clean bready malts, which melds evenly into a full hoppy finish, with a resiny almost grapefruity character.

4275,"2006-05-31",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2017 Bottle.  Clear pale golden with a pillowy white head.  Amazing, still smells like smoke, though more subtle than the others from Schlenkerla.  Initially crisp, tastes mildly sweet and very malty with less smoke than in the nose, not overdone; balanced and light, with a long dry aftertaste and a note of final bitterness.  I have to wonder, was the smokiness intentional, or has every piece of equipment in the brewery been contaminated with that delicious Schlenkerla goodness?  Thanks to pivnizub for this treat! [2006.07.04: 3.5]I seem to recall having a bottle or two of this since pivnizubs treat, but heres one in the USA as an Easter treat: Smoke is much more reminiscent of raw bacon or even uncooked cured ham than the others in the portfolio -- less Maillard to get in the way?  Lighting has a lot to do with perception -- this can look anywhere from pale clearish yellow to neon yellow to dingy light golden, but clean with a large and extremely foamy bright white head.  Taste is subtle and dry, very smooth and relaxed flavor without punishing anywhere; malt is grainy but clean, deep, thin and theres a shade more citric  noble hopping than I remember.  Not as crisp as that normal Helles-Pilsner range, but also not flabby and much more drinkable -- carries with it some of that wooden / barrel character, rustic chic.  A gentler and occasionally preferable offering.  [2017.04.16: 4.1]

It pours incredibly clear, very pale gold with quite a thick, smooth snowy head that diminishes slowly leaving significant fine lacing....the nose at first exhibits that typical Schlenkerla meat-smoked-over-hardwood character, entrancing and sweet, but even with just a couple of minutes in the glass lighter, grass lager characteristics show up, dry hay mingling with applewood and lean bacon, more subtle and less intense than the rest of the brewers work but not much less inviting....in the body, ah thats a premium German lager, no doubt about it, plenty of noble hop presence as clean grassiness up front and increasing in robust bitterness towards the finish, smoky hardwood sweetness and delicately caramelized malts playing a presence as well....carbonation is unsurprisingly fairly low and in this case I think maybe it works against the beer, creating a little stickiness that seems to argue against the heavy finishing bitterness rather than partner with it, and showing transparently a fair amount of metallic character as well (the water, perhaps?)....all in all not quite on a par with the rest of the Schlenkerlas IMHO though it is still drinkable and distinctive enough.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

I dont see any sediment, but the head is full, creamy, rocky and creates plenty of lacing.  Strong retention.  Pure, brilliant gold in color is the body, while the head is slightly off-white.  Either it is bottle conditioned or its just extremely fresh and these guys are incredible at artificially carbonating their bottles.Smells of lightly singed wood, touches of lightly grainy malts and a surprisingly low amount of yeast apparency.  Touch of munich malts in the background perhaps, but its difficult to be sure in light of the smoke.  Extremely clean and flawless.  Light bacon, touch of spicy hops pop up with some moderate caramelized sweetness.Effervescence swiftly carries sweet honey/pils-like malt notes about the palate upon first sip.  Spicy hop notes tickle the sides of the tongue in conjunction with light smoked malt phenols.  A hint of peachy-nectarine and a gentle reprise of soft honey on the end.  I guess this is a smoked pils?  Dosent seem much like a helles, as it would be overattenuated for that style and dosent have the yeast apparency or sourish munich malt notes.  Whatever the hell it is, its absolutely stunningly-well brewed.  Hops linger on, lengthening the spicy nature.  Never a shade of thinning, even upon warming, and though the beer seems filtered, the mouthfeel has just enough residual dextrins to keep things lightly creamy and substantial.  Moderate carbonation, perfect attenuation, smoke is not overdone for the size of the beer.  Hops even seem to grow in flavor as the palate becomes accustomed to the smokiness.

The flavor is sweet and lovely smoked - giving it hints of tared rope, combined with strong notes of wood, leading to a dry end. Nice.

4275,"2005-07-10",4.1,"I am a fan of rauchbiers, so was unsure how this lighter version would stand up to the high quality I expect from Schlenkerla.  Poured golden, from the glass it appeared as a typical pilsener, but when the aromas hit, I knew it was what I expected.  Subtle hints of smoked malt in the nose carried into the modestly malty sweet palate.  Shared with friends, this one garnered high praise from all.  
Unfortunate I havent seen this in the US, thanks to my Brother for bringing this back with him!","Eastampton, New Jersey, USA","Cornboy"

Weak smoky notes that are rather enticing - because of their lightness. Fresh and surprisingly easy to dring for a ""Rauchbier"".

4275,"2005-06-04",3.4,"A big thanks to Skidz, my roommate and Beer Advocate, for bringing this and other tasty beers back with him from Germany!  Im drinking this with burgers and brats on the grill, as it should be the perfect beer to compliment grilled meats on a very humid June day...  Pours a crystal clear bright gold with a big, bright white head.  Aroma is (of course) smokey, bringing to mind fried breakfast sausage and almonds, complimented by a light flowery smell and some woodiness.  Taste is smoked nuts, mild citrus, cooked cereal  and some hops thrown in to boot.  Surprisingly refreshing for a smoked beer, partly due to a rather mild smoke presence.","California, USA","tomxcs"

Beautiful......","Bochum, Porúří, GERMANY","pivnizub"

The smell was like a Marzen and the colour was virtually clear.  The taste was however better being clean and dry.

4275,"2004-03-06",4.2,"Very smoky (duh).  Really reminds me of barbeque, mesquite or something.  Being that I generally associated these scents/flavors with barbequing stuff, this beer smells like meat to me.  I'll add that I really, really like barbeque, though that's not particularly relevant.  But what is relevant in the long run?  I mean, on a cosmic scale, even the deepest concepts are . . . wait, I've wandered.  Back to the review.  Reminds me quite a bit of Rogue's Mexicali Ale, just missing the slight smoked chili aspect of that one.  Has the same nice, creamy texture.  Quite malty.  Was really taken aback by the nose at first, but a surprisingly enjoyable brew.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
4275,"2004-02-09",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 26, 2008 Bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is clear medium yellow. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted bread), lightly to moderately hoppy (flowers, herbs), with notes of smoke and honey. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. A simple beer, but very clean and succulent.  Lovely aroma where malt, hops, and the smokiness all play equal roles.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
4275,"2004-02-02",2.1,"UPDATED: FEB 3, 2004 Bottle from the Swan and Rushes. Very disappointing stuff. Bland aroma: hammy lager, sweet and salty. This tastes like normal lager with a bit of ham. The flavour is not full and there is little development - in fact it's not at all complex. Some tingle on the tongue and a dry finish, but not too much out of the ordinary, only a little extra taste to a normal ' bad' lager. Disappointing from such a good brewer.","Birmingham (via Leicester), West Midlands, ENGLAND","DanielBrown"

Slight head with slow moving bubbles in the body.  Dry grassiness, hay--is it Saaz?--flavor suggests popcorn butter.  Didn't find much smokiness.  Unexceptional to my taste-buds.
