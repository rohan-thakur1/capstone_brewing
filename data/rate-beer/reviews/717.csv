Pours dark red, almost bleach color with a small beige head. Bourbon-y vanilla on the nose, licorice, toasted malts, cocoa, caramel. Flavor is dark chocolate, cocoa, vanilla with bourbon sweetness, wooden notes, faint toffee, rye notes are quite well hidden. Pleasant creamy palate, alcohol peaks through a bit on the aftertaste. Quite nice.

717,"2017-05-12",4.8,"This is an exeptionally good beer, one of my favourites.
It pours a deep brown liquid with thin, dark beige top that dissapears in a few minutes.
Aroma is complex - at first it reminds me of just fresh rye bread but after a few minutes it develeps into a variety of nice things - white bread that is burnt above a campfire, plum and blackcurrant jam, vanilla with milk chocolate.
Taste is very light for this abv, reminds me of dark kali a bit. Amazing.Rye bread with liquorice and some rasins in it, dark fruits, milk chocolate, even some smoke... It feels noble and sweetish and really good. I wonder how it will taste after three years in a cellar.
One of the best brews by Lehe IMO.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","CaskSensei25"

717,"2017-02-17",3.7,"Bottle. Teku. (thanks martjoobolut). Pitch black with moderate, thick, light brown head. Good head retention and lacing. Aroma is rich toasty, lightly roastiness, grainy, chocolate, cake and vanilla, raisiny notes. Nice bourbon-like notes in the background - not intense, neither really up-front. Taste is surprisingly sweet - moderate to light heavy. Medium body, oily texture, soft to average carbonation, finish is sweet, vanilla and chocolaty. In overall good brew, not dominated by bourbon notes, but still rich, full, mellow. A little bit too sweet.","Sosnowiec, POLAND","BlazerT"

717,"2017-01-16",3.6,"Bottle (BB 14.03.18, batch #1). Dark brown body but not as dark as your typical stout. Speaking of, this is a rye stout and should therefore go under Specialty Grain here. Aroma has a nice woody and softly vinous barrel influence with notes of rye bread. Mild and sweet bready taste with soft barrel influence. Even feels a bit light. Sweet bready finish. Good barrel job but the result couldve had even more character if the base beer had been richer.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","thirstyrabbit"

717,"2016-10-16",3.6,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2016 330ml bottle (Drink Baar, Tallinn)
On opening, some berryish vapours waft out of the bottle - promises good things. Lovely rich roast aroma, a touch burnt but not harsh, chocolate cakey with vanilla. Full palate, smooth, pleasantly carbonated, not heavy at all. Taste mostly as youd expect - sweetish smooth rich roast, a bit raisiny, even a touch winey later after some hot food. Vapours project the strength, but theres no unpleasant alcohol taste. Finish drier, bitter chocolate, gentle bourbon woodiness.
Rerate: Tap (Koht, Tallinn) (7:4:7:4:14=3.6)
Full and rich, worth every point. BA not overdone at all, nicely mellow. At its core, this is a proper beer not a gimmick.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

717,"2016-10-08",3.5,"Bottle from Sip ( 7 or smth). Batch 1 (not a good system, Lehe). BB 14.03.2018. Pours reddish black. Head beige, not very big, retains nicely. Aroma, hmm, the dark rye bread crust works well with the sourish grainy Bourbon notes. Nice but very meek. Tastes roasty sourish-bitter sweet, but the Bourbony alcohol shows all too obviously. But I kinda like the non-Imperialness of this. Dryish roasty on the palate. Body a bit too thin. Alright overall.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Kauge"
717,"2016-10-07",3.7,"Bottle, batch 1 (from Koht). Pours dark brown. Aroma is roast, malt, chocolate, vanilla, oats. Flavor is sweet and bitter, vanilla, malt, roast, chocolate, oats, some rye spiciness. Finish is roast bitter with vanilla sweetness and some bourbony-boozy notes. Alcohol is rather covered. Overall: good, but feels bit too fresh and too sweet, this may get better with some time on it (unfortunately I dont have another bottle). I like that they have not over done the bourbon.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","martjoobolut"
