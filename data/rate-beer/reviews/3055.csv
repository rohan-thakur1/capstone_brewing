3055,"2017-04-28",4.0,"0.75l bottle shared with The Tasting Crew. Nice sweet rye aroma on this. Caramel and a nice vanilla-like sweetness. Yeah, really nice. It has in the glass a quite clear deep amber and a nice medium sized slowly islandy beigeish head. Nice. It doesnt taste bad either. It really doesnt. A lovely dark sugary sweetness. Almost a little burnt. It has a good oily texture in the mouth and its about average on the carbonation. Mild whisky infused, some blue grapes. A wild rawness, but its not boozy or too sharp at all. Yeah, a highly recommend one. 18.02.2016","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Taste is rye spirits, oak, followed by some light bitterness with a semi dry rye spice finish. Not on the same level as the bourbon, this one is very rye forward and its not as smooth and somewhat harsh compared to bourbon version. That being said its aged in rye barrels so I guess it should be both harsher and less smooth then something dropped in a bourbon barrel. Notwithstanding I had this next to the bourbon its still pretty tasty. If you like rye you will dig this.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","kbudd19"

3055,"2016-02-22",4.5,"From notes. Enjoyed at the 3rd Annual Barleywine Tasting at Traviss house. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a deep ruby with a nice thin collar of egg shell colored head that vanishes quickly leaving a little lace. The aroma is a little boozy for my liking. There is a pretty hefty rye spice to go with a woodiness and a bit of booze. There is a little caramel and some light (well, dark, but minimal influence) sugar on the back end. The flavor is fantastic. There is a plethora of things happening. The chocolate and caramel balance out wonderfully, there is a light vanilla, a spicy rye, and a pretty good addition of booze. Its not overly done, just balances well. The mouth feel is thick and viscous. There is a soft carbonation that leaves this baby to hang around for days. The aftertaste is a little hot, but nicely spicy with a wonderful vanilla caramel thing happening. This is a damn good barleywine. AleSmith kills it again.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3055,"2014-10-25",4.0,"Bottle from Belmont. 

A: Dark mahogany to the point of black. Thick creme colored head dies a bit into a half inch foam. Legs. Inviting.

N: Big melted caramel and vanilla nose. Lots of toffee, buttered toast, spruce, peppercorn, and rye whiskey. Touch of char and smoke. Tobacco and melon.Cinnamon, and of course oak.

T: Buttery and sweet. Some minor bitterness. Surprisingly tame - not that its boring, but that its integrated so well together. 

M: Lusciously thick, feathery body. Fuzzy carbonation, light, but enough to keep this from becoming boringly dense.

O: A different breed from the bourbon. Its softer and less intense; smoother and balanced. I think I would take the bourbon version, but neither of these are a waste of your time.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

3055,"2014-09-05",4.3,"""Had side by side by side with a super fresh (base) Numbskull, and a bourbon BA Numbskull. Alesmith has always been heavy handed with the barreling, and this is no exception. I think the barleywine base is hoppy enough to cut through all the time in the bourbon, but in this one, that really wasnt the case. The barrel influence is strong. Tasty, but heavy. Smells awesome. Super smooth body. You expect a ton of heat on the back end and never get it. Pleasantly warming throughout. Spicy, sweet toffee, beautiful nose. The flavor is delicious but more one dimension than the bourbon version and especially the base. This seems to have been a very sweet rye whiskey. Overall, a decadent treat, but not as complex as Id hoped. At 4.3, probably my least favorite numbskull (every batch ive had of the base has been better than the last, including last nights - a 4.5+ on its own).""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

Sticky caramel aroma, prunes, raisins, toffee, butterscotch, spicy wood (rye whiskey influenced, perhaps) with plenty of present booziness. Similar to the original BA Old Numbskull, just a bit more vibrant & spicier. The booze on the palate is actually much smoother than expected. Brown sugar, caramel coated dark fruit, Caramelo candy, big woody barrel presence with inherent spicy notes & very faint vanilla. Finishes on a spicy note, again, with lingering, sweet residual sugar. Big bodied, but not as sticky as youd think. Very good stuff! I preferred this to BA Old Numbskull, if nothing else, it had a smoother & more well integrated spirit presence & I enjoyed the little, spicy edge.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
