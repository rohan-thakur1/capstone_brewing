3917,"2016-07-05",4.1,"Bottle with thanks to Matt! Pours a deep purple, burgundy, with a fairly sizable pinkish purple white head that fizzes away pretty quickly. Really beautiful color on this one. Aroma is all berries, not really distinctive other than raspberries. What the Romanians would call Fructe de Padure. Some lactic acid and lemon on the nose as well. Flavor is less tart than many, loads of berry notes and lactic acidity. Light body, fizzy carbonation. Grate.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3917,"2016-05-18",4.2,"Bottle given to me by Justin, thanks man! Pour is a beautiful rich purple with a large fizzy pink head. Aroma is incredible. Lightly tart with musty berry and then jam, lots of it. Lightly sweet and tart jam. Awesome. Flavor is quite tart up front with light funky and berry to follow. Effervescent palate and a quick berry finish. Big flavor but clean. Flavor not as jammy as Aroma. Excellent.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"

3917,"2016-02-22",4.3,"750ml. Thanks Morgan for sharing. Thick dark red. Like the skin of a raspberry. Aroma is a berry kick in the face. Taste is raspberry and black berry. Ton of it, Like second only to R&D sour fruit in that category. Signature de garde sour with a touch of funk. This is really good. I love a super jammy spour, but this is almost too much fruit. Almost like Im wondering if this is preserves not beer. But the sour is there almost balancing it out. Really good stuff. Damn.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"

3917,"2015-11-23",3.2,"Bottle at De Garde, pours a deep dark purpleish mahogany with a small pink head. Aroma brings out loads of pithy berry notes, moderate tartness and earth. Flavour is very pithy, with loads of dark berries, dirty earthy notes and shit tons of pith, almost too much. It works alright, but its rather muddy. Okay.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
3917,"2015-11-21",4.2,"Bouteille 75cl de et partagée avec Pierre T.
Couleur acajou-pourpre, col rosé disparaissant vite.
Arôme est intense, fruité de baies dont lélément principale est bien la framboise. Retrouve un rétro terreux, fruits fraichement récoltés avec une pointe de levure sauvage.
Palais est fruité versant de suite dans le profil de framboise, terreux dominant ponctué par une fine note aigrelette provenant certainement des mûres. Effervescence est moyenne-haute. Le côté aigre nest cependant pas trop avenant et laisse ample place aux fruits.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

3917,"2015-11-02",3.4,"750 mL bottle. Deep purple with a pink head. Pretty. Smell is heavy on the raspberry and de Garde yeast. Taste isnt as dynamic. Mostly lemon sourness and that de Garde acidity. Berry fruit flavor in the back end. Oak. Light body. High carbonation. Too much. Not offensive. Just not exactly good.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
