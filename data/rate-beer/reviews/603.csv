603,"2017-05-06",4.0,"Nitro pour at CCB. Pours a very dark brown color and topped by a nice, smooth head of tan colored foam that shows good retention before settling to a thin layer and coating the glass in lace. The aroma shows notes of dark roasted coffee and malts along with notes of bitter sweet chocolate, mocha, and vanilla cream. The flavor follows with the sweet and roasted coffee right up front to go with the dark chocolate and roasted malts, toasted caramel, and some vanilla cream. Nearly full bodied and ultra smooth and creamy thanks to the nitro with balanced carbonation that leads to a lengthy bitter sweet and slightly dry roasted coffee finish. Really tasty stuff and a great beer to put on nitro.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

S: Quite possibly the boldest coffee stout I have ever smelled. To say the aroma is of fresh roasted espresso beans would be an understatement. Bold espresso with roasted malt. Light chocolate notes.

T: I love me some coffee beer and this one is coffee on crack. The espresso flavor is huge right from the start. Has the same jolt as when you eat chocolate covered coffee beans.

Nose is a ton of espresso, roasted malt, chicory, and the bitterness inherent in those.  Flavor is a lot of coffee and espresso flavor, but balanced overall.  Lots of different roasted flavors in the beer, and it refuses to be pigeonholed into being labeled a ""coffee beer.""  I swear it has the caffeine to match, too.  Very good beer- will stand up with any of the top ten coffee beers.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
603,"2008-12-28",3.7,"Draft at the brewery, courtesy Joey & Wayne.  Pours just about pitch black, perhaps showing a hint of mahogany at the outer reaches.  A thick, spongy, light brown head displays excellent retention, leaving gobs of sticky lace on the glass.  The aroma is knock your socks off espresso, roasty as all hell.  Being married to a Cuban woman, I am used to this aroma on Sunday mornings, as the little *cafetera* is always brewing up some Cuban Coffee.  After the initial blast of espresso, the nose opens up to reveal malted chocolate, scorched caramel, and heaps of earthy hop bitterness.  Flavors follow suit, again incredibly roasty and very accurate in interpretation of a Cuban Coffee beer, complete with a lightly acrid finish.  I will note, however, that the name implies that there is lactose in the brew, which I was unable to detect.  Nearly full on the palate, with a silky mouthfeel and light carbonation, even the body resembles that of a perfectly roasted cup of espresso.  This is a really nice brew, especially for those with a penchant for hearty coffee, but I think the addition of some lactose would improve things overall and bring things more in line with both the name of the beer and the sweet stout category.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Good gravy, the aroma is amazing. It is full of robust rich dark roasted coffee beans that nearly bring me to my knees. Wow. Behind that are notes of dark chocolate and a touch of heavy cream. The flavor does not disappoint. I love the full rich decadent yummy very dark roasted coffee. Too many coffee flavored beers just smell and taste like Folgers crystal, meh. This beer has the goods with mouth watering espresso like coffee beans that I need to find and start making coffee with as soon as possible. Like the aroma there are supporting notes in the background like velvety dark chocolate mixing with a mildly drying lactose sensation that play together in harmony with the bold coffee notes. Wow.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
603,"2008-12-26",4.1,"Bottle courtesy of Retorp. Pours a dark black color with no head. Aroma is pure freshly cracked roasted coffee beans (that I could smell the minute the bottle was opened). Flavor is almost exactly the same with some hints of vanilla and cream with fainter notes of raisins, roasted malts and spice. Full body with lingering coffee finish. If you like coffee beers, this is the granddaddy of them all.","Tampa, Florida, USA","kiefdog"
603,"2008-12-24",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2011 Draft... Pours black with a small, creamy, light brown head. Good retention. The aroma is an acrid marriage of rich, dark chocolate and espresso, along with dabs of vanilla, molasses and soy sauce. Medium to full-bodied with tingly carbonation. Espresso bitterness is perfectly balanced by chocolate sweetness and a lightly acidic note. Lengthy, bitter, coffee finish. My after-breath smells like coffee, not booze. Perfect nightcap!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
