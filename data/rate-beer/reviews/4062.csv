La mancanza di frumento, unita ai luppoli freschi, a differenza di un Lambic classico, crea un taglio netto tra l'attacco acidulo ed il finale amaro.
Corpo medio-pieno, mediamente carbonata, oleosa ed astringente.","ITALY","SkillsFactory"

I have not had Iris for years, not since the lambic craze has started and the work to acquire it is too much. Additionally, I have never seen Iris on tap. Menu says this is the 2015 batch. With those factors it felt ok to pay so much for the beer. Comes to me with no head, a thick golden body that one cannot see through. Looks still. Once tasting it there is just a little bit of bubbliness to it. Otherwise, surprisingly un-acidic, un-Cantillion. A funky, bretty beer that is missing the Cantillon signature assertiveness. The floral aspect stands out because its rare for the style but I would not say that one could guess its actually flowers.

Sweet and sour as one might expect. On the sweet side, theres caramelized sugar and faint flowers. On the sour side, I detect mild citrus and some yeast.

The flavor is overtly tart. Lip puckeringly strong. The finish is a dry bitterness--I dont think its from any hops. No notable sweetness; this comes across like an unsweetened lemonade. The body is full while the carbonation is surprisingly light. If you like your lambics overly sour, then youll love this one.

4062,"2015-06-28",4.0,"(750ml March 2015 bottle @ Brewberry Cave, Paris, June 17 2015) Pours hazy orange with a moderate head of small white bubbles. Aroma notable for its presence of malt and fresh hops. Orange, herbs, dried grass, lots of wood, sweaty funk, very lightly tart, with a bit of malty sweetness. Palate is fairly dry, with a hint of malt sweetness but also light acidity building in the middle. Lemon, a bit of orange juice, aged oak woodiness, musty, a bit of caramel, lots of grassy, even pine notes. Finish is quite dry and light to medium bitter with the woody older lambic feel quite prominent and even a touch of grain, along with persistent hops. Medium body with fairly light and effervescent carb. The barley malt and dry hopping really come through in this beer, I like that it wears its non-traditional lambic characters on its sleeve but still drinks as very Cantillon. Preferable to many average gueuzes for me, though it does not match Cantillons best fruit lambics or LP gueuze.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

Hoppy with a citrus acidity. Equal quantities of maltiness and acidity. Lemony sourness, but nothing like other Cantillons. Malt replaces grain and hay. Hoppy flavor throughout blends nicely with the sourness. Malt flavor dominates the finish. Medium bodied, but less spritzy than other lambics. Medium carbonation. At first, I wondered why they messed with the malt profile of a lambic, because it initially doesnt work as well. After a while, though, you stop worrying that it isnt wheat and realize that its a delicious and maybe more balanced sour.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

4062,"2014-06-11",4.3,"Thanks to OldMrCrow for sharing these bottles of Iris with me on a lovely spring day. From notes. 
 
2004 (bottled 2006): Orange pour almost no head after first few drops. Aroma is delicious - grape must, citrus, horse blanket cantillon funky feet. Taste: some breadiness, a bit of leather, super super tart. No real carbonation, slick lemony coating -- a lot of lemon/apple. Some sweet tarts if I leave it swirling in my mouth for a long, long time, which ultimately ends with a huge lemon citrus tart wave that makes me almost want to cry. Pears, cheese. Some sediment. Really musty, pear, funky and citrusy. After OldMrCrow mentions it, theres an undercurrent of a sulphuric old rubber. Really fantastic.
 
Fresh(ish) batch (bottled 2013): Well this is totally different. Appearance: Creamy white head with fine lacing. Sediment in there. Somewhat darker orange-amber. Aroma: dandelion (think pissenlet), soap - herbal hops dominate the aroma here. Taste: Way less tart, but still finishes all nice and funky. Not as ""extreme"" on the funk side as the old bottle, but more interesting with the hops -- to the extent hop presence indicate freshness, this is clearly the fresher of the 2. Theres an element of freshly cut hay in the aroma that I cant get enough of. Also sweeter than the 2004.
 
I can see the appeal to having a deep lambic cellar. Sometimes you want to be outside in the field, and sometimes you want to sit your ass inside with some musty old books. Beautiful beer at either age.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

4062,"2014-05-02",4.5,"Opened a batch two bottling of Iris (offset label/2000 cork) at the JF Vonck tasting in NYC, 2/14. The beer has held up extremely well, the age hasnt detracted much if at all from the overall essence of what the beer was meant to be. Having had nearly all of the other available Iris vintages (Including a batch one shared with Steve K in 2010- Thanks Todd!), it was evident in the 2000 vintage that age can make things a bit murkier, a bit darker in color and perhaps more full bodied, while still retaining funk and developing more earthiness for well over a decade. The older examples of Iris, all the way up to 2003 375ml, seem to exhibit a sort of profound stoic funkiness with a firm acidity- though not bracing or bright by any means. A subdued, hazy treat to enjoy with your thinking cap on, this certainly stretches the definition of what dark, unblended lambic can be.","Massachusetts, USA","gn0sis"

4062,"2014-04-13",4.4,"10 years old. Vintage 2004 (bottled 2006) shared with prufrockstar.

Ive been sitting on this one for years waiting for just the right occasion, and this is it -- a long sunny weekend afternoon, the first warm one of the year. The bottle opens with a weak puff, and pours yellow tan, slightly hazy, close to still. The aroma is divine -- unmistakably Cantillon, characteristic dry rubber. Hugely funky in that Cantillon way, amazing fruitiness, hard to place but Im going to say Asian pear. Spectacular. The flavor is almost startlingly leathery at first, not quite as sour and much less fruity than expected from the aroma, lemon juice of course but even more very chewy, very dry. Totally delicious especially as the palate acclimates. Lack of carbonation is not a problem on the tongue. I think the acidity compensates. Lovely beer. 10/4/8/4/18=4.4.

3 years old. Vintage 2011 (Bottled 2013) shared with prufrock.

Pours just slightly darker than the older bottle, with an expansive if short-lived white head. Aroma is totally different from the 2004: explosive herbal (mint? not quite) notes from the hops, recalling fresh(er) Orval. Much less leather than the 2004, instead a sweet-ish grapefruit pith. Compared to the old bottle, the mouthfeel is downright spritzer-ish. This is quite a bit more approachable than the older one, but doesnt soar to the same heights 9/4/8/4/17=4.2.

Served to me at delirium cafe, brussels. 

A: bottle has appeared to be in a place with lots of soil as I can rub the label and it feels like man hands at the end of a day of landscaping - rough and granular. The beer pours a turbid and hazy honey color. Having been poured with vigor, bubbles appeared at the surface, but transiently. No lacing. 

S: tart lemons come thru with some interesting earthy and bell pepper tones. Some cider vinegar and also some anise seed at the tippy tip of the tail. 

T: zinga! Sour beer! This is so sour it burns the roof of my mouth, gangster. Flavors of sweaty leather, lemons, potting soil, sheet grass. 

M: thin and dry, nearly no carb left here. As mentioned, top of mouth was burning and at the end, my tongue was quite raw. 

O: although this may be the sourest beer Ive had, which is awesome, I dont think this beer was particularly great for cantillon. Although still very good, and I would drink again and again.

Pours a hazy/mirky copper orange with a fizzy off-white head. A decently aggressive pour yields about 2 fingers-worth of head. Some decent head retention leave a thin layer of head fizzy here and there. Lots of funky, tart, and sour notes smacks you across the face right away. Barnyard, horse blanket, and some tart citrus notes as well but this is pretty much funk funky funkness. Not quite as funky as the nose. Has tart orange-peel notes that stick out a lot and make the finish bitter. I dont know if Im really digging that characteristic but it doesnt totally ruin this lambic. Citrus, tart/sour, some acidic notes in there as well. Light and fizzy, just how I like em. Very champagne-esk dry finish.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Sean9689"

4062,"2013-01-31",4.4,"750 ml corked and capped green bottle; bottled on May 5, 2012; almost 9 months old. After almost three and a half years on this site, an unblended lambic finally comes my way. This is the last style on this website that I have yet to rate, all other styles long since found and rated. Im not a trader, so this shit is hard to come by, especially here in North Idaho. I have Russell Mann at Enoteca to thank for this. I placed my order for this about two years or so ago and it took him awhile to get it, but he followed through. Pours murky orange with a large cream-colored head with good retention. Aroma is wonderful in its funkiness, classic lambic barnyard with lemon, floral, earth, SweeTarts--nice and pungent, although my favorite American sours are a bit more up my alley. Taste is nice, sour and acidic, but not quite as mouth-puckering as La Folie or Avery Odio Equum; finishes dry and a little bitter. To my surprise, its not flat. Ive always heard unblended lambics were lacking in carbonation, but this isnt; its actually moderate. Really good, but I prefer Cantillons Gueuze. Definitely a worthwhile beer seeking out, even if it takes awhile to find its way into your hands.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"
4062,"2013-01-29",4.3,"Thank you to my friend Tobey for bringing this fine souvenir from Copenhagen. Vintage 2011, 750 ML, poured into Three Floyds Teku glasses to split with my wife. 

The aroma is classic Cantillon. Enticingly sweet and remarkably sour in the nose. Barnyard and fresh cut, wet hay meld with green apple, honey, and lemon zest. 

Color and appearance are both notable given the beers amber hue, which is a clear contrast to the usual golden straw of Gueuze or Cuvée St. Gilloise. Clarity is nearly perfect, and the beautiful pure white ring of carbonation provides another fine contrast in appearance. 

First sip at 45 degrees is full on sour. Sour apple, white grape, citric acid dominate. As the beer warms past 55 degrees, lightly floral notes become present in the finish, likely a function of the growingoy present hopping. The tartness begins to linger in full funk as I continue sipping. This isnt as pleasant as Cuvée St. Gilloise, but its close. 

The lambic has a greter body than most of its siblings, which I enjoy immensely. The lingering funk and tannins keep the taste buds at attention. Also interesting is a lactose-like creaminess that lingers on the back of the tongue. Definitely unique in Cantillons already impressive oeuvre  

Overall, Iris is not my favorite from this brewery. However, it is enjoyable, delicious, and is worth seeking out again. Id love to try it weeks old as well as perhaps 5-10 years old to taste the evolution of the hop presence.","Texas, USA","bootsjohn"

Pours a hazy orange in color with maybe a quarter fingers worth of tight white head. Nose is exceptionally balanced. There is lemon and a fair amount of floral character to it. It resembles a Cuvée des Champions or Saint Gilloise in my opinion. Flavor starts out with some bright lemon and then immediately turns to the floral aspect of the beer. Its gentle grass and tartness....exceptionally balanced. Mouthfeel is light, carbonation is gentle, as well as the acidity, a moderate finish. Never had this before, but I am a big fan of this.

Now I have the privilege of a bottle gifted to me from some family just returned (well, a few months ago!) from a trip to Brussels. Chilled this (from room temp) for about 8 mins in freezer and then 10-20 mins in fridge. I think that got it to about 50-60 F, which was recommended. In any case, poured it into some small tasting glasses (shared with a few people). It heads up like a champagne--quick up and down, but has a bit of linger. Definitely true to description with the darker gold pour, but aroma is all sour (not much hops--but maybe Ive been drinking too many CA IPAs lately). Very tart, very dry. Tough beer for the uninitiated. Finish has some chalkiness. Pleasant; good for pairing; can really cut against strong foods. I enjoyed this.","California, USA","cmc619"

Flavor is the same, but tame on the front end and bitter on the back (but still ends fairly quickly with slight linger). The palate is excellent. I've heard about Cantillon, but this is my first. Excellent beer.

Pours clear brown/dark golden, with almost no head, fully diminishing. Aroma is of funk, sweet, hops, and pine. Taste sour, funky, hoppy, acid, and sligth citrus. A very good and refreshing lambic. Way less sour than usual other lambic-based beers. Somewhat sweet, very drinkable. [Further notes: drank a 2003 (near 10 years old): indeed hops have faded, but the beer is well preserved. No clear improvement here.]","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","Minderbinder"
4062,"2012-03-17",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2015 Multiple times from bottle (750 ml) and tap. 

Appearance: Slightly hazy orange/golden with a small mostly lasting off-white head and little lacing. 

Aroma: Oak, strong but not overpowering floral presence, barnyard, herbal presence, brettanomyces and dusty notes.

Taste: Wood, barnyard, moderate sourness, citric notes, quite floral too, herbal notes and dust. Light to moderate bitterness.

Palate: Light to medium body. Medium carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel. Dry and woodsy finish.  

Overall: When fresh, I think I slightly prefer it on draft but it also become stellar in bottle after a few years (its still amazing fresh). Amazing drinkability with a good complexity and superb balance. Nice cohesion between the floral presence, the citric notes, the barnyard, the oak and the hops. Superb!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

4062,"2012-03-12",3.0,"From notes.  First reviewed 9/26/2011.  2006 Vintage. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tasting glass.

The pour is a golden caramel color with a delicate white head. A few spots of lace stick to the glass.

Lilac, some hay, and a good amount of barnyard funk provide the base of the aroma. An omnipresent sour aroma is there as well.

The taste is both fairly sour and also brashly bitter. These two sensations together are not very pleasant. There is a lemon zest sour flavor to go with the light malts, but as the flavor transitions to bitterness I feel like I am chewing on flowers. Overall it is a tart, funky, and flowery taste. 

The body has dried out a fair amount while retaining a light oiliness. Medium bodied with light to medium carbonation.

This combination of flavors really did not do it for me. I prefer their other sours.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Medium bodied with a fine spritzy carbonation. Flavor of pale Belgian wheat malts in the background, with complex flavors of lemon, funk, flower petals, and green apple. Good amount of acidity without going over the top. Sour, acetic finish that is about a 8.0 out of 10 on the mouth puckering scale. I am shocked at how well this is drinking.

4062,"2012-02-12",4.2,"Fresh 750ml bottle, courtesy blazer06.  This one pours a cloudy, golden orange color and topped by a small head of off white foam that slowly settles to a thin film and leaves a sudsy wash across the glass. The aroma is really nice showing a good amount of fresh peaches, apricots, and chardonnay grapes that add ample amount of citric acidity. The oak imparts notes of soured wood and vanilla to go with a big dose of floral hop bitterness in the back ground. The typical Cantillon funk is there, but the floral hop bitterness seems to overshadow it. The flavor follows suit and is initially oaky with vanilla up front and then followed by a huge dose of soured apricots and tart white grape skins. There is a good amount of vinous character from the grapes and oak and finishing with a good amount of bitterness from the dusty, floral hops. Really delicious stuff. The palate is quite substantial, which is a change from the typical Cantillon, and very dry and parching with tingling carbonation throughout.

4062,"2011-03-31",4.0,"2007 vintage. Beer served in a snifter. Beer is dark amber and completely hazy. Forms a surprisingly big head (the cork really popped out fast) and the carbonation is really high. Head is off white and made up of small bubbles. Doesnt leave much lacing on the glass. Looks great (although I dont mind my unblended lambics to have almost no carbonation).

Strongly tart with mild fruit aromas in the nose. Apples, some apricots (I know these fruits arent here, just saying what I can smell). Mild acetic acid notes, nice lactic notes. Smells good.

Beer is super sour and has a nice funk to it. Lots of carbonation in the mouth. This pushes the limits of what I think a sour can be. Very lactic / citric in the front and then oak and woodsy at the back with a lingering funk. Drinkability is good but its not my favorite lambic from them. Overall I still thoroughly enjoyed it.

4062,"2011-01-21",4.4,"From notes:

2005 vintage. Pours a dark hazy amber/orange color with a one finger frothy white head that quickly settles into a thin ring. Minimal spots of lacing. Visible carbonation bubbling up.

Funky aroma with a decent amount of barnyard/horseblanket character as well as hints of earthy oak, tannins, vinegar, light fruit and earthy hops.

Medium bodied and puckering without being acidic at all. Sour/tart up front with a decent balance of musty/earthy oak along with subtle pale malt, earthy, bitter hops and crisp light fruit. Very complex and well balanced with a nice amount of citrus and other sweet, vinous fruits balancing out the sour funk. In addition, the hops used make this beer very unique for the style. The dry and cold hopping results in a earthier, slightly more bitter lambic than usual, but not to the detriment of the other characteristics. Theres still plenty of funk but this is slightly better balanced and easier to drink than some other Belgian sours. Recommended.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Pours clear to dusky honey-amber with a subsiding, uneven, slightly yellowed collar. Intense, drool-making scent of mouldy lemon, horseblanket,  blackcurrant wine gums. Not as bone dry and teeth-squeakingly caustic as your typical Cantillon; plenty of lemon and sour apple acidity, but leavened with honey, green tea and Rowntrees blackcurrant wine gum notes. I really can taste a citric, lemon zest softness from the hops here- deep in the mix, but reminiscent of a US variety (!). Goes from puckeringly tart to hoppily (almost) dry in one swig.

Thats what the cork says. Its streaked with yellow and smells of vinegar. Yet its more auspicious than the crown cap, which is stained with a ring of black matter. This beer should be prime drinking material. ""Should"" being the operative word; Cantillon bottles dont age so much as fester.

Cloudy and urine colored, it smells like a homeless person whos fallen into a crate of rancid lemons. Yellow woodsorrel, funk, and oak dominate the flavor. Missing are the algal bloom qualities of fresh Iris, but the beer remains full bodied, broad shouldered, and barrel chested.

The price difference between this and the Classic Gueuze is due probably to the hops. In that sense, aging it was a bad idea. But this is still a flavory beer. In the senses of smell, taste, and sight, yes. Age it. Can I reconcile this? Who knows? Guess Im not much of a critical drinker.

amber colored from all barley. medium sized head, little to no lasting retention. nose has a heavy potpourri/perfumed hop scent on top of milder pedio and lacto notes (light solvent, slight barn must, horsey, mild mallo, etc.). oak is mild to medium, honey-like in flavor with a barely-discernible scent of vanilla. flavor is focused forcefully on the fresh hops, giving it both an intense hop bitterness and a wood oil resinous quality that reminds me of the bitterness and astringency of absinthe (but not the flavor). somebody else mentioned malort, which is also made from wormwood. my guess is the uncharacteristic fresh hop bitterness combined with oak barrels is responsible for this incredibly long-lasting wood oil flavor and astringency. its honestly a bit off-putting, though not offensive, but I can easily see how it would ruin the experience of this beer for people. its nothing like traditional lambic, lacking both the 1/3 raw wheat character and the acid cleanliness that comes from avoiding aroma and flavoring hops. acid is medium to low for unblended lambic, but does successfully catch the back of the tongue in a refreshing bite and burst. body is crisp, frothy and full. bitterness is heavy for the style and seems out of place and brash. the hops are disjointed and give it a green/floral/vegetal flavor that doesnt work. no surprise that this isnt how lambic naturally evolved. by the end of the bottle the wood oil and lacquer astringency becomes much more off-putting. an interesting lambic to revisit and explore more now that I know what I like much more than I did in 2004 when I initially sampled this beer. Ill keep a couple of bottles around in the cellar, but I honestly dont find this lambic appealing enough to buy and cellar cases.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

darker than expected.  amber/hazy orange.  med head, nice lacing.  nothing too exciting about the looks.
nose: upfront sour, yogurty, milky.  coriander, apricot baby food (possibly from pedio ethyls?), cider spices--clove, nutmeg, squash blossom, baked pumpkin, potpourri
mouth: upfront sour, but much drier than nose would indicate.  bitterness from fresh hops.  this has a very long finish, evolving in some really disgusting ways.  after the upfront sourness, theres the hoppy bitterness, which is followed by a lingering wood oil bitterness of sandalwood, dried flowers, turpentine, lacquer, gross herbals like jaeger and other bitters/amaros.  this reminds me of malort, both in flavor and the way the nastiness lingers.  after 30 seconds, theres a distinct skunkiness that overtakes the mouth and makes me want to chug anything sweet.  baking spices from the oak develop as it warms, which doesnt help anything.
the worst part is the lack of integration between the layers of flavor.  the sourness, which is actually quite pleasant, lays lightly on top, while the bitterness and oiliness below seem detached from both the expected flavors and textures.","denver, Colorado, USA","ephemeral8"

4062,"2010-05-08",3.7,"750mL of the 2005 vintage from Bruisin.  The cork pops off violently, though no gusher ensues. Poured into a Trappist glass this ale is very apparently cloudy with a orange colored body and an explosive white head which disappears into nothing after a minute. The aroma is bluntly sour. The blended lambics Ive tasted have a complex, woody character and a deep, layered sourness. This one lacks those deep nuances and rather displays aggressive, one-dimensional sourness with a surprising bitterness as well. Its not necessarily a bad thing, I can appreciate a ""to the point"" type of beer. The flavor packs lots of bitter bite, almost like grapefruit but without the full citrus character that some PNW hops can provide. I dont get any real oaky flavor that I associate with blended lambics, again making this unique.  Tart vinegar is all over the place, making for a puckering beer. The palate is medium-light with a prickly mouthfeel. Its a good beer and different, indeed. But in the end I think blends provide more bang for the buck flavor-wise.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

4062,"2010-01-11",4.2,"Vintage 2006. Bottled in 2008. Serving date: 2009-01-10.

750 ml bottle, corked and capped. Bottling date and freshness date on label (Bottled 2008-05-26, best before 2015-12).

The pour is golden/copper - almost reddish - and semi-clear. The color of this brew is very appealing. The white, 1 cm head is lively but quickly dissipates leaving a minimal ring of lacings. The head is not as big as anticipated (perhaps due to the chosen glassware).

The smell is rather complex: Scents of unripe green apples sit side by side with hints of grapefruit, and in the other corner vinegar tags up with a faint funky smell. Amazing smell.

The taste is even more complex than the smell. Where to start, where to start... First of all, this is a very sour beer. Sourness and tartness thus being its main characteristics. Tastes of especially lemon, but lime, are up-front and linger on throughout the experience. A fruity character of unripe green apples and grapefruits is also prominent. Vinegar also reappears in the taste, but is not as dominant as in the smell. A faint hint of yeast is also detectable. Subtle hints of a funky barnyard taste adds an interesting tension to the taste of the concoction. The very long finish is primarily sour and a bit dry.

The body is medium. Carbonation is good. The sourness sends a tickling feeling to the cheeks, which is a pleasant sensation.

I really like lambics and in my opinion this is a really good one. The distinct sourness actually doesnt become overwhelming, even though the bottle is 750 ml.

4062,"2009-12-15",4.0,"12.7oz bottle. 2007 vintage bottled in 2009. Pours a lightly hazed, golden-orange body with a big, two-finger width, rocky and fizzy, off-white head that dissipates at a moderate pace and leaves a layer of bubbly foam on the surface as well as the glass upon swirling. Aroma is flowery and bright citrus with some tart funk over a light malt. Woody and dry with some apples, gooseberries, and barnyard. Pleasant, abundant aroma that never gets too sour or funky. Flavor is pretty complex. Some gentle sour, earthy flavors up front before flowery, tart, citrus takes the forefront. The barnyard funk presents itself more in the finish along with a pretty cool woody bitterness. The bitterness is light, but stands out more because this is so dry. Flowery, even citrus tartness, and wood linger for a moderate duration with the dry hoppiness. Pleasant, bubbly carbonation. Overall, I liked this one. Lots of tartness, but never gets overly sour or too mouth-puckering. I like the amount of funk that comes out at the end and the dry, woody hop bitterness is quite unique. I wanted to try a ""fresh"" bottle of this (bottled in 2009) before opening an older one. I look forward to tasting older vintages.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Crisp, tart entry with hints of sour apple and vinegar transition into a funky barnyard earthiness with hints of hay and wheat mingling along with light notes of leather and manure that give way to a lightly floral, dry hoppy finish that lingers along with some fruity undertones.

Further in more dryness, a lingering funk and slight rubber, and moving out with a light sweetness in the finish lingering with floral hops and citrusy sourness.

4062,"2009-07-11",4.2,"2005 vintage, bottled in 2007 - rusty cap under the foil (where was this kept?) - this is unique for a Cantillon in that 1. it is not over the top sour, and 2. for a lambic, there is a lot of hop character - the nose is actually quite full of the floral and citrus character you expect from hops, and even some of the sweetness of the malt base is preserved - the expected funkiness and smooth oak is there as well, but its not as extreme as you would expect from this brewery - really well-balanced and inviting - creamy body, full mouthfeel - quite oaky and bitter and first, with some moderate acidity behind it - then some of the malt shows through, and acts as a base for that complex wildness that Cantillon is so good at producing - this rustic character combines well with some gentle hops and floral/herbal qualities - bone dry, bitter finish - superbly balanced and tasty - one of the few Cantillons I can drink an entire bottle of in one sitting - delicious.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

All the same characteristics are present and WOW does it pack a punch! It shocked the whole inside of my mouth with how sharply sour it is, damn. This was so freaking good!

This is a delicate flower of a brew from Cantillon.  The color is a very straw like color.  Lighter than the gueze, with a similar quickly diminishing head.  Looks very much like a champagne.

The cork was pretty disgusting, beginning to rot with a gross black liquid bubbling out of the cracks! Oddly, this did not deter me and seemed sort of normal...Anyway it looks like a gueuze, golden orange hardly any bubbles. It smells nice, fruity and malty with a slight earthiness.

Hopefully it isnt unfair that Im sampling it after Temptation, which was damn good.  2005 vintage (cork says it was bottled in 2007).  After filling my snifter I spilled the last 2 to three ounces  -- DAMN (!) at least I got the good clear pour and spilled mostly just the dregs.   Pours with a bigger head than I would have imagined for an unblended (the 1900 had no carbonation at all).  Beautiful still amber body with a bit of a tangerine/orange hue to it.  Nice white head that leaves great lace too.  Very unique aroma -- funky, barnyard, and peppery in a way I have never experienced (almost burns the nostrils).  Both the aroma and flavor are the most unique ones I have encountered in any lambic BY FAR.  The flavor is similar to the aroma but there is a very organic flower quality, not like the flower quality that can result from hops, but like a flower was actually sitting in the bottle all this time.  So unique I cant describe it any other way.  All of this weirdness in the flavor and aroma are lingering of a solid gueuze backbone.  Medium tartness.  Finished medium dry and pretty quick.  Medium bodied with minimal carbonation.  Overall: if you are into lambics you MUST try this because this is crazy shit! After you get used to the flowery quality this stuff is outstandingly drinkable.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

Funky aroma with a light fruitiness, good hoppy to sour ratio on the flavor that is surprisingly plesant both flavors are very under control and do not overwhelm eachother, the funiness certinally takes over the hoppiness in the older vintage.

It poured murky amber/orange body with medium sized head. Nice vinous aroma, seems so simple, but shows slight fruitness like citrus fruits and peaches. Sour flavor for sure, relatively complex with yeast being prominent, some fruitness again - peaches, white grapes. Also you can feel notes of oak barrels. Full body with for lambics usual, full carbonation accents fine acidity in the finish and makes it long. At the very end becomes rounded with malts and/or yeast. I pretty like it, but although I respect its complexity and quality, it’s a bit too wild for my taste and I had better lambics.","Split, CROATIA","heavy"

4062,"2008-12-28",4.3,"2005 bottle, aged over 3 years.  Initially only lightly hazy, each careful pour of the 750ml bottle results in a slightly cloudier, orange-amber colored body.  A small, foamy white head settles to a thin but lasting film, a soapy wash leaving scant lacing spots on the glass.  The aroma is beautiful, showing deep and complex notes of dried apricots, Chardonnay grapes, fresh peaches, and tart citric acids.  Heaps of fresh oak impart sour wood and vanilla components, while a surprisingly ample **for a lambic** dose of dusty, floral hops adds a lightly bitter kick.  Of course, it would not be a Cantillon without some farmhouse funk on the nose, though it is not exceptionally prominent in this gem of a brew.  Flavors are softly oaky and vanilla laden up front, transitioning quickly to tart and fruity, before finishing vinous and tannic.  Apricots and white grapes are abounds within.  Dry and parching on the palate, with a lightly tingly effervescence, there is a good deal of body to this one, perhaps a result of the wheat component.  This one feels like a bigger beer than it is, which is an interesting departure from the typically light and refreshing Cantillon palate.  Overall, this is a phenomenal brew, right up there with Cuvée des Champions, Saint Lamvinus, and Blåbær Lambik as the best that I have sampled from this incredible brewery to date.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

4062,"2008-06-30",3.7,"4 oz sample

This was my second sample.  While I liked the Grand Cru slightly better I would not pass up this either.  As I drink more of the Cantillon line up I come to appreciate them in small doses.  It would be tough to knock off a 750ml alone but with a few friends it would be a fun evening.

Aroma / Appearance - The slightly carbonated body swirled lazily around the small sample glass.  Rose, oak and strawberries made a fruity combination backed by cedar chips and a light tartness.  A residual dryness reminded me of red wine.

Flavor / Palate - Much more sour than the first sample this was still not exceptionally aggressive.  I was able to work my way through the sample without any difficulty.  Raspberries, bark and vingery notes marked the blending of fruit and sourness.  The acidic finish had that hallmark Cantillon intensity.  I wouldnt have been able to drink much more than two more ounces in a sitting without my stomach giving me grief but it was a nice beer.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Also a bit surprised to see that Paul never rated it until just a few days ago!  hazy dark amber with light greenish motor oil tinge.  Little to no head, whatdya expect?  Aroma is musty, floral (clover), funk with light bit of dust and hints of wet wood.  Palate is a bit on the full side for a lambic, but also unexpectly effy.  The requisite Cantillon sourness is most apparent and yet its not overly sour, more like a sharp funk that lasts.  After the first few sips, this beer is nothing but refreshing and the finest choice I could have made from what was on hand tonight.  the astringency is not at all overwhelming.

It was in great condition, and had everything I like about Iris, but this one seemed more powerful and even more acidic than usual.  Pours a typical slight shade darker than cantillon lambic or gueze, mostly golden copper with a fizzy head which dissipates, first pours clear, then hazy towards the end.  Aroma is the typical iris funk, along with its hoppier nose (hops were still apparent despite its 8 year age), dull dusty hops as well, some light funky cheese, sweaty wet animal, goaty and more farmhouse funk with a nice citric and lacitc acidity.  Flavor is musty and slightly copper- metalic with tons of nice powerful lemon rind-grapefruit rind acidity, earthy hops, tons of woody tannins- vinous as well with some nice sour notes and astringent woody character.

Besides Marko and myself, this beer was tasted by my parents and

Now, Im not all that experienced with lambics. I mostly liked what Ive had so far and I wondered how this would compare. It certainly looked good. A murky light brown-orange colour with a small thick white head. A typical lambic aroma (ok Im a heretic probably for saying that)... nice and funky/sulphury.  The taste is remarkably balanced and quite pleasant. A balanced seesaw with the strong, lemony sweetness on one side and the typical sulphury funkiness on the other. A lingering sourish aftertaste. Wasnt all that complex in the malt department but it was certainly interesting and tasty. It didnt rock my world like I hoped it would but Im certainly looking forward to trying some other Cantillons.","Split / Zagreb, CROATIA","Marko"
4062,"2008-05-18",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 21, 2008 I must admit, I always approach Cantillon with apprehension. Im as fanatic about lambic as one can be, but time and time again Cantillon has never quite done it for me. Still, I appreciate the beauty of the effort; its sad to see the tradition wane and for that reason alone I feel compelled to continue enjoying their brews as much as I possibly can. The Iris pours a cloudy but bright orange hue, glowing deeply with the color of a fresh apricot. The creamy off-white head is fairly ordinary which makes me wonder why crazy head formations are rarely seen among lambics. The aroma is exciting, and bests most Cantillons Ive had before. Beautifully funky, the house character is present but softer and perhaps more cheesy than usual (a positive note, in my regard). Apricot lends a certain tartness, as do the tangerines and peaches. Cheesecake and brown sugar add a luscious sweetness to balance the nose. Surprisingly ash also is apparent, giving a slight smoky note that I wouldnt have expected. The flavor isnt as puckering as usual but Cantillons touch is certainly present. Perhaps more dilute, this lambic is greatly refreshing especially served on the cool side. The minerality is pleasant, working well with both fresh hops and fresh cheese. Green apple and melon add zest and balance while the long finish continues to echo a flavorful cheesy funk profile. Didnt think I would attain Cantillon enlightenment on this brew, but Im certainly happy I did. An excellent lambic!","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

On to the beer. Lively head during the pour, but vanishes very quickly. Pours a hazy dark gold color. Sweetish but primarily tart and acidic aroma reminiscent of yellow grapefruit. Nice mouthfeel, feels light on the tongue but has some depth and viscosity to it, almost like gum syrup in a cocktail. Carbonation is somewhere between the Grand Cru and the kriek. Taste is citrus rind tempered with bitterness of pith; grass and hay; develops in stages and finishes surprisingly sweet, almost like beginning with yellow grapefruit and winding up with a red one. A really interesting lambic, and perhaps a good stepping stone between Cantillons fruit lambics and the more intense Broucsella Grand Cru?","New York, New York, USA","nparikh"

Sharp, tangy aroma is a bewilderment of funk and oddity; balsamic vinegar, raw lemon juice and the most fire like of red peppers force a searing sour heat.  Field grass, solvent and used band aid, and some zested citrus underneath.  Wild.  Taste is more of the same, with lots of punchy acetic and lactic acid, raw spice and wood, and animal stink.  Palate is jagged and bright, with sparkly effervescence and a burning acidity on the back end; a flame of lime juice and wooden dryness.

Somewhere between orange and brown, this beer is hazy and forms a 2 finger off white head. No lacing, ok retention. Expected for a lambic. 

Aroma includes vinous grapiness, some apple, overtly tart. 

Tastes funkier than James Brown. Sour, lactic, acidic, but oh so good. Crabapple comes through strong. Kind of winey. 

Though the head dissipates pretty fast, the carbonation is alive in well in the liquid, though maybe a little subdued from the 3 years it has been aged. As is the norm for gueuzes and lambics, the tart finish begs you to have another sip.

The body has a medium thickness with an oily and slightly dusty texture and gentle carbonation. This is a very interesting lambic, but I prefer gueuzes.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"

On tap at the Football Pub in Rome. Best example of Iris in living memory for me; lively, tangy, mild yet balanced sour cut right through the beer. Intriguing aromas of perfumed hops, or so it seems. Vinegar and salty lining to finish. Looks middle aged at 5 years.

4062,"2008-01-16",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 11, 2008 Just got this from hopscotch, THANKS! Big Green champagne 2005 corked bottle with a cork that was difficult to remove. My first blended lambic.  Lambic beers symbolize the epitome of  the beer world, the original style beer is still the best style. As far as looks go, this is some what like cloudy pink brown yellow reminiscent of raspberry gingerale. The smell is a tart aroma, which I think I can smell it even before the slowly moving cork is totally removed.  Raw unrefined odors abound. With the first taste I notice perfect amounts of tingle on the palate. Taste is beautiful tartness that is tempered by a goodly amount of what I dare to say is grapefruit rinds. However, it is not the medicinal dull bitterness of typical hops, it is more rough and simple, or possibly the word Im looking for is basic. Overall, Im surprised lambics can be so hoppy, I rather didnt expect such bitterness in a sour beer. Left me with the impression of coarse fresh grapefruit juice from grapefruits that were not really ripe. The hoppiness distracted me a bit from the real sour tart attributes I desire and this kept me from rating it really high. Even tho this was a big bottle, I got to the bottom of it with very little effort, it was gone and I was sad. Has an almost undesirable bitter linger.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

Due to a recent head cold, one nostril is backed up. So, Im having some slight difficulty assessing the aroma. I do sense some clean, sour notes with a light caramelly sweetness. Spices also seem to be pretty apparent. The flavour has a real nice mix of sour and bitter, somewhat like a lemon rind. Sourness becomes more subdued in the finish as the hops become a little more prominent. I would like to revisit this when my senses are at 100% working order.

4062,"2007-11-24",4.2,"Beautiful thinned lacing, soft and diminutive white head, creamsicle orange is clouded clouded by light tan yeast globules. Slow recession gives this behemoth of acidity a livelier appearance than some of its brethren. Grass tendencies rise to and spill over the brim of the glass. Beach-washed woodiness splashes into play, coerced forward by nose-tickling acids that reap the whirlwind that is dry-hopping a lambic. This is going to be crazy bitter, I know it already. Mild oak and fresh floral and vanilla tones lurk in the depths, coalescing as the lambic draws nearer room temperature. Mild barnyard and tired grain field notes seep out of the cracks in the acidic affront. Apricot, tangelo and bristling pear pulp flirt with edges of reason. An entirely new concept in the world of lambic is well-received; nonetheless I remain wary of just how powerful the impending acidity and bitterness combination may unfold in the flavor. The hop notes are a clever blend of aged and fresh, both with redeeming and offsetting qualities that serve the quest for complexity well. Alcohol is a nonfactor. This nose is tremendous and unforgettable. Bitterness is hefty indeed when the first sip passes the lips. Wood and some requisite leather pound into the palate unmercifully, but are supassed by waves of face-twisting acidity. Its brutal, but enjoyable and oh so quenching. Sourness winds up up and punches everything out of its way whenever this seems to let up for even the slightest moment. Grassy notes are oft intercepted by herbal hints and superbly offered, seeming to ride along on top of the earthy and aged woodiness and farmhouse maltiness. The palate impact remains light because the body is light-medium and fully carbonated. Rarely does a hardcore lambic bring so much joie de vivre to the table, such bounciness melded into a brazen, tingling acid attack. The finish is highly bitter, lightly herbal, sour and funky. wood and grass linger. Delicious. Cantillon is consistently incredible - even in outlandish and eccentric expressions their beers seem methodically crushing but remain riotously fun to consume.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Nonetheless, this beer packs some intense and refreshing sourness that I found very pleasant.  If you like gueuze or are into sour, I would definitely recommend this beer.

Appearance was a hazy orange with a head of tiny bubbles.  Aroma was lots of great sourness and a candy-sugar sweetness.  Flavor was full-on sourness, which reminded me (if memory serves - which it probably doesnt) of the Cantillon Grand Cru Ive had before.  I also got some sour apple flavor.  I didnt taste the hops or iris included in the brew, but enjoyed the taste very much nonetheless.  Mouthfeel was astringent (owing to the sourness) and good.

Under the foil wrapper, a dusty layer of grime. The cork, under the cap, responds to the lightest touch of the corkscrew with a hiss. Excellent--I love a hostile beer! Clean white head on an warm orange pour, the malty orange color I associate with octoberfest beers. A nice touch of haze. A first sniff is funk--lovely peppery wool and dry red earth smell, a grape skin tannin touch. But around all that is an unusual sweet note--not sweet like candy, but sweet like spring air, etherial and soul-stirring. And I know this sounds nutty, but I feel like deep underneath there is a trace of gentle biscuit malt. Initial bracing grapefruit sour flavor gives way to herbal, peppery notes. The sourness blends very cleverly with an earthy bitterness that lingers into the finish. A subtle, elegant variation of the classic lambic formula. So refreshing. Mmmmm.

Overall, minus the aroma, this is a very delicious brew.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","Lowe1983"

Vinegar, orange zest, grapefruit and hay, almost that typical lambic aroma but magnified. Wow, very intense and vinous or champagne like (I swear I wrote that before reading the commercial Description) with notes of citrus and yeast. To be sipped as wine and has that belly warming feeling. The mouth watering tartness coats the tongue and leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste.

Re-Rate - Bottle from Quaffs
Here I am again with a whole 75cl to myself, woohoo!.I took a bottle of this to a tasting recently and we never got round to it so I left it for the others, Ive been craving it ever since. This bottle is definitely not on par with the previous, Im not sure why but the cork being cracked surely didnt help. Golden or pale amber and what was at first a huge pillowy white head has withered to nothing. Smells like straw, grapefruit and apricots. Taste is similar but tart and salty with a little alcohol burn on the way down. More subdued and definitely not as intense as the last bottle but the last pour, with all the funk, livens it up a bit. Not quite the same experience but Ill still drink this again, its great. 8, 3, 8, 4, 18.","Greater London, ENGLAND","reakt"

A good beer but the malts really weigh on your palate and make it hard to get much into a bottle...my girlfriend and I took a long time to finish the 750 mL, and shes no slouch when it comes to drinking her share, especially for a 95 pound 52"" Japanese girl.

4062,"2006-09-07",4.1,"A Mes rate: 75cl bottle from Cantillon. As promised I drank this asap as I was recommended to do so by the wonderfully friendly Mr. Cantillon (so sorry I forget your name) This is very unusual stuff. Particularly for Cantillon. The fresh hops show very strongly throughout and as a result give what is for me, a unique drinking experience. The aroma is that of the hoppiest beer I have tried, almost totally devoid of all the characteristic Cantillon barnyard funk. That does not for one minute mean that it isnt fantastic, just most unexpected. Close your eyes and you could be sniffing at an extremely hoppy English ale. Almost. Oh, some marzipan and a slight sweetness to it also.  Colour is akin to that of an Orval, cloudy and orange and therefore most inviting. Such a difficult one to rate. I was expecting the full on Cantillon sourness but in the mouth it is comparatively mellow. Well I say mellow but what you get is a huuuuuge kick from the hops that I think is fantastic. Followed by just the right amount of lambic tartyness which lasts until the start of the finish (if you get me) followed by another big dump of hops leaving what is a wonderfully clean, crisp and dry ending. A most intriguing blend of two different characters, one of which is not usually my bag but here it works extremely well. Its all down to the fresh hops really. Very grassy and lots of green stuff. If you are just getting a taste for lambics but love hoppy beers I would strongly suggest this.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

And while its not on the level of an IPA its there and the melding of the usual suspects and the hops is terrific. Appearance is a dark orange color, slightly hazy, small head. Mouthfeel is full and round, but not stripping like other lambics could be. Flavors are simply incredible with leather, horeseblanket, earthy, some funkiness but added to it is the grapefruit bitterness which is simply awesome.

4062,"2006-06-11",3.9,"Botted in 2005. Poured an amberish color with a small head that laced ok (nothing spectacular, although the deeper color was notable). The aroma was for sure funky, some burnt rubber, wild farmhouse and barn aromas, light on citrus and no cheese. The flavor was enjoyable, revealing a definite departure from classic lambics with the all barley malt. While the wild flavors were all there, the tartness was much subdued and the funk took over with leather and rubber type flavors on display over the citrus notes. The finish had a firm hopped barley bitterness, quite nice. Mouthfeel was light to moderate, quite refreshing.","","User37895"

Old, musty smell of lemon juice squeezed over a crumpled horse blanket.  Some herbal notes as well, carried by a breeze of desert pollens.  Medium bodied, almost creamy mouthfeel thats loaded with danish blue cheese and unflavored yogurt.  Actually, it tastes almost like I imagine blue cheese mixed into yogurt and topped with a squeeze of fresh lemon would taste like, only the blue cheese disappears toward the end of the sensation.  Some woody flavors support the cast as well, providing images of fresh aspen bark and oregano stems.  Quite interesting overall, and much less sour than I had originally expected.  I want to say I would enjoy this more without the blue cheese flavors, but then again, thats what gives this brew the unique thouch that I enjoy contemplating.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

4062,"2006-04-12",4.6,"I was expecting this to be good but in a different way than what was delivered. This was a lovely beer, easily sessionable as I imagined the summer months- at a quiet café in the back streets of Brussels, maybe- as I hastily sipped this, lapping up its intoxicating flavours. Ignoring the fact it is freezing cold right now here in Oz. Anyway; tasted from the crown-corked bottle and poured into a shallow chalice. Presented well in the glass; a bright sunny orange with very, very fine whispy carbonation raising up to a thin layer of creamy white froth that lasted and left some fine lacing. Took a moment for the aroma to release, but then it all flowed freely for the length, tickling the nose in good Cantillon fashion. Fresh, grassy herbs, biting spices and driftwood up first before some sour, acidic grapefruit and lemon, sweaty goat hair yeasty notes, soft watery cheese and an odd hint of fresh kilned clay. Interesting and pleasing, even to my not-all-too-impressed wife. Tart, bitter and dominated by fruit in the mouth. Light hints of pine-needles, almonds and cork sit under layers of unripened grapefruit, tart and bitter oranges and some vine-clippings. Lambic base-beer is soft and musty, only adding its fuel to the long fruity aftertaste. Light sweetness shows as it warms. Body is extremely light, delicate and softly, prickly on the tongue. I had more notes but I fear Im starting to ramble on. I could honestly sip this all day as it changes character as it goes along. Perfectly balanced and fine tuned Lambic from one of Belgiums finest. Absolutely lovely!!! (75cL, 2003 vintage, Intl Beer Shop, W. Leederville)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Aroma of hops is clearly detectable and I thought it provided an interesting mariage with the sour and brett character of the original lambic. It also seems to help balance the level of acid in the beer, which is a real, plus since I sometime find the Cantillon lambic to be too acid. Horse blanket and farmhouse quality are still apparent as well as the citrusy hops. Very nice experiment from the folks at Cantillon.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

Also much deeper gold, approaching orange, in color (again, undoubtedly due to the lack of wheat).  Initial fizziness and big, white head disappears almost immediately leaving a beer that is, frankly, not-quite-but-almost-still (which is absolutely NOT a problem with a lambic even if most of the time theyre nearly champagne spritzy)    Subdued aromas.

2004 Bottle. Pours a gushing honey orange hazy pour, with copious off-white head. Sour, acerbic aroma of brandied pears, olives and some green grapes. Also a little Parmesan cheese and some cask aroma. Sour dry flavor of olives, oak and more cheese, all very funky. I dont have much experience with true Lambics, so I never know what to expect or garner from the situation, but even since my run in with NG Sour Brown, Im more interested in wild fermented beers. This is wildly funky beer. In a way, I feel like Im drinking green olive juice. Very much pimento in this beer. Theres a nice subtle, floral sweetness in the background thats lifting and airy, and really brings a lot to the table. This is much more quaffable than my previous experiences with past lambics. Palate is some how dry at first, then finishes sweet and supple. A softness and smoothness to this beer. My bottle keeps gushing. Interesting and woody, a lot of tooth and chewiness. Enjoyable.

4062,"2005-11-15",4.1,"750ml bottle: 2000 bottling sampled 11/15/05.  Pours to a murky dark browish yellow with a huge, well retained light beige head.  Initially this one appears almost muddy, but when held to the light it really glows warm amber with some red highlights.  The aroma is bitter with light wet grass, earth, barnyard with herbs, mild cheese curds, mild lemon zest, and a hint of sweaty malt.  If you smell it while cold, immediately after being poured, the fresh hops are just detectable.  The taste has that initial sour kick, though it doesnt quite hit with the intensity of some other Cantillon lambics.  Theres some sour lemon, medium acidic grapefruit, vinous grass, light wheat, barnyard, and at times theres almost chardonney flavors.  Medium bodied, lively carbonation, finishes dry and lightly sour, with mild acidity.  It seems slightly sweeter with more body than usual for a lambic from Cantillon.

4062,"2005-11-10",3.4,"Brewed 2003. Didnt really get into this the last time I had it - in fact I poured most of it out, though in fairness I was drinking it warm in a Brussels hostel. Nice clear amber-gold, with a nice thin head which lasts. The initial aroma is difficult to describe, but theres something in there that I just dont like. Quite herbal, cheesy hops, with a fair whack of pineappley esters, cream cheese and lots of plasticy, sweaty phenols. After a while it improves with that heathery Styrian character and more of the musty Cantillon imprint. Theres a smooth, biscuity, vanilla milkshake malt flavour, with a mild, vinous (Riesling) acidity and a ferrous bitterness with a rasping aftertaste which kind of mimics the feeling in the back of your throat after vomiting. Some apricot juice character, and its sweeter than the usual Cantillon. Features elements which are pretty reasonable in their own right but they dont work too well together. More an interesting experiment than something Id like to drink regularly, though towards the end of the bottle I began to like it a whole lot more - like an old Orval or something (and yes, Im aware I compare every second beer I drink to Orval.)","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

A fair bitterness adds a dimension to the already interesting beer, pushing the dryness even further.

4062,"2005-10-12",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 16, 2005 Bottle 2001. This is our 6th bottle of Cantillon Iris, so we obviously like it. Our first three bottles were from the original 1998 brewing and came in hand numbered bottles - cool touch. Every single bottle has had a grotty, rusty bottle top - some with liquid bleeding through the cork. Never mind, beer is fine. You are wise to remove the metal top and wash the bottle top with cool water before removing the cork. The aroma is wonderful and immediately announces that Cantillon lambics are no ordinary beer - huge citrus, lime skin and light hints of flowers and spruce. Pours with a nice head that diminishes. The color is an absolutely gorgeous amber - very appealing to the eye. The initial flavor is huge sour citrus with a long, astringent, bitter finish - think GRAPEFRUIT.

Tart, quite acidic flavor with a strong lactic acid finish and somewhat bitter hopping. Medium-bodied, sour and acidic palate with soft carbonation. A nice, earthy brew, but with quite much acidity.

It poured a dirty yellow color with a tall, bubbly yellowish head.  The aroma - well, to me it wasnt pleasant.  It was an acrid, earthy, barnyard aroma over which drifted some light floral hop scents.  The flavor was mainly sour and bitter, grassy, earthy, with a lemon twist.  The finish was a dry, tart one in which the floral hops make one final, brief visit.  My lower rating undoubtedly stems from my unfamiliarty with the unblended lambic style.

This is a masterpiece.  Massive creamy head. Gleaming amber body. Resiny sheen and dense white beauty. Nose: Signature Cantillon sourness, although with a tinge of piney hop bitterness. Quite a lovely flowery effect.  Mint and dill. Only a slightly crumbled dusty character pushes through. The horseblanket brett competes with hoppy resin and the overt sourness. Flavors: Tart apple and rich sweet malt. The flossy sweetness of the malts really shows through on this one. Incredible to taste a gueuze that is as syrupy sweet as this one is.  Orange rind and pine trees. The dry hoppiing is magnificent . The sourness of the gueuze and the hoppy bitterness really combine to create a minty flavor that is refreshing.  Carbonation is excellent as is the mouthfeel. Very resiny and slimy. Thick and coating like cough syrup. This is a MASTERFUL outing. Exquisite.

4062,"2004-10-21",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 14, 2006 2000 bottle sampled Oct. 2004.  Well I enjoyed half of the bottle and my friends sink, counter, floor and stove top enjoyed the other half.  I should have known when I put the corkscrew in and the cork began to remove itself, but what could I have done (got a big glass and put it below the bottle I guess).  Well anyways, it erupted like Mt Vesuvias. Incredibly violent and forceful upward explosion which was quick and sad.  Oh well, its a lambic, Im not surprised.  Anyways, this almost 5 year old lambic poured with a vigorous large, brown head (beige cardboard color, walnutshell if you will).  Murky gold, deep deep copper body, with light yellow tinges on the edges.  Aroma of cedar, wet sawdust, sandalwood, lots of hops, vinegar, pepper, oak, and an all around lovely walk down the country road after it has just rained.  Flavor starts off with plenty of mouthpuckering tartness, though the hops bitterness adds to this and its not all caused by the yeast and bacteria.  Apple cider vinegar, green apples, light raspberry esters with a dry malt backbone.  Light sweetness lurking at the bitter end, with a sweaty, almost oily sort of lactic acid flavor.  Rich cedar and oak linger long on the palate, and for an unblended lambic its not nearly as thin or watery as I was expecting.  Rich, powerful and profound.  The huge carbonation, which died off as I let this breath for a while, still provided for a peppery textured body throughout.  Good stuff, but I like the consistency and chewiness of wheat in my lambics.  If I had to pinpoint my dislikes here, which were few, it would be the lack of a truly ""chewy"" texture, but the beer is still superb in its own right.On draught at Redbones, August 2005  Actually, I had it on draught at Anam Cara about a month ago too, but that sample was in terrible shape and quite oxidized.  This one proved much more fresh, hoppy, tart and rustic.  BUT, it still is too loose in texture for me.  I think this stuff is probably better a little bit younger, where the beautiful hoppiness and a bit sweeter flavor, as has been confirmed, in my mind, by my samples of younger bottles, still exists.2005 bottle consumed 2/9/06.  Very quenching, fruity, acidic and with a large amount of pediococcus in the middle, ending more drily on a lactic note.  Lots of green apples in both flavor and aroma, very musty, cheesy, lightly tannic and just overall, bursting with flavors.  My biggest complaint, though its not as evident in this sample, as in some of the older ones, is that the beer is a bit watery and the mouthfeel looser than it should be (to convey the sourness and even the hops).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

A steady pour into my New Belgium globe glass produces a two finger thick, light tan colored head. The beer is a rich amber color that shows an almost brilliantly clear, bright copper hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells lightly tart, somewhat herbal, definitely floral, and even citrusy, the last three definitely from the hop character. The aged malt and hops combine to form a note that is not unlike lemon infused, southern sweet-tea that is quite a bit different from what one usually gets from an overused of crystal malt. Musty oak / wood aromatics, touches of tobacco, some hints of urea, and touches of pinesol add some complexity. The malt character takes on some oxidation here, this accentuates the tobacco note, as well as the sweet tea character, but there is also a fresh, whole grain, sweet brown cracker like note here once you start to pay attention. I really like how hoppy this still is; I really like that the citrusy hop notes are still able to come through.

Bitter, sour, with woody and pine flavors that coat the tongue, this beer is definitely green and hoppy compared to a Lambic. The malt / grain character isnt quite so different from a traditional Lambic, but this doesnt have the grassy grain character, and perhaps has a touch more whole grain cracker flavors to it. Effervescent and fairly carbonated, the beer is fairly light bodied, but does have some palate presence; the latter contributed by the malt, and oak tannins. The oak character here is subtle, but does seem to influence the perceived hop flavors; it gives a woody edge that accentuates the pine notes, brings out a nice tobacco notes, and the spice / astringency from the oak also seems to bring out the same in the dry-hop flavors (hints of pepper, something a bit like arugula and other peppery herbal notes). Grapefruit hop notes are hard to pick out as it melds well with the lactic sourness and grapefruit Lambic character, but are definitely here even if at an integrated, low level.

Just a fantastic brew, I wish I had a whole lot more of this, and I had certainly forgotten how good, and just how unique this brew was. For some reason this makes me even more excited to try the Amphora Lambic when that finally gets released. The tobacco notes are quite distinct in this brew, and the citrusy hop character, though light, is also a nice addition.  Really, I just cant get enough of hops and Lambic, of which this beer is a great marriage. It is hard to not absolutely love this beer, the complexity and balance is pretty phenomenal across the board; this is the freshest (still almost a year out) that I have tried this beer, and I am thinking that fresher is better for this one.
Bottled 2002, Sampled February 2004
4.3, 8/4/9/4/18
This beer pours a hazy amber-copper color, which is in stark contrast to the typical light gold color of a traditional Gueuze.  It is reasonably well carbonated.  The carbonation creates an off white head that is persistent but only 1/4 inch in my tulip glass.  Wow, the aroma has as the strongest element  definite notes of cat-piss, surely the most I have ever experienced in a Lambic beer.  Other aromas of musty barns and of course some sour notes as well.Upon my first taste I notes that there is lots of hop character for a Lambic type beer, which mixes quite interestingly with the traditional Lambic character.  Dont get me wrong, the hop character is fairly subdued but it is here, even after 3 years of aging in the cask.  This beer is of course sour (what else would you expect from a Cantillon product), with notes of citrus (a lemon & grapefruit mix) as well as a hint of vinegar.  The barnyard musty-leather Brettanomyces character is quite prevalent in this bottle.  This concoction showcases what this fickle funky yeast can do.  This beer is quite fruity as well, what comes to mind as an apt description for this fruitiness is that of sour apples.The lack of wheat in this beer seems to make this beer a bit fuller/ richer in the mouth than a typical Lambic product.  This beer is not overly hard either, especially for a Cantillon Lambic.  This was a wonderful first beer on a Superbowl Sunday afternoon.  It paired wonderfully with the aged sharp cheddar, prosciutto, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and rustic bread.  Cantillon definitely delivered once more with this beer.  This is a world class beer, whose only flaw, given the specialty designation on this beer, is that perhaps it is not quite distinctive enough from a traditional Lambic, but how can I really complain since I do love Lambic.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Pours with a foamy white head over clear copper body.  Lightly sweet aroma with a citric acid tang.  The initial sour flavor is so intense that its hard to pick out whats going on.  Once that subsides, the hops the description speaks of come out.  The beer finishes out with a pleasant sweetness (relatively speaking, the tartness is still around) as your tongue recovers from the sour assault.

I initially was going to mark this beer down for those intense flavors (too harsh), but after some reflection (and temperature increase) the big flavors grew on me.  Its nice to drink something very very far from the norm.

Thus, the Cantillon beckoned me.  When I had seen the bottle on the shelf a while back, I had even thought, ""this could be The One.""  It had rested gently in the minifridge ever since, awaiting this moment.  I selected a proper glass, and retrieved the delicate Iris from the fridge, bringing it to the kitchen.  I carefully removed the foil and the metal cap, and gently coaxed the cork from the bottle with my trusty waiter's friend.  Mother $#@%!  A geyser of geueze gushed over my hand, spewing like a fire hydrant.  I must have lost a 1/4 of the bottle across the length of my kitchen.  I think I saw a 2000 on the cork as I was throwing the bottle opener across the room.  Swearing under my breath, I caught a good bit of foam in the glass before things calmed down.  The aroma was easy enough to rate, the stuff was all over me:  Barnyard, sour apples, and urinal from a baseball stadium after about 5 innings.  Appearance was what one would find in an unflushed stall at the same ballpark.  I consider this to be appropriate for the style, so good marks!  The flavor was sour, with some apple notes, cider vinegar, and cheap California Sauvignon Blanc that has turned in the bottle because it was left uncorked for a couple of days.  This gave way to notes of green wood, and finally a gentle bitterness.  Just fantastic.  I wanted something memorable for number 100, and this didn't fail me.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

The dry hopping with extra hops, this time, has marvellously complexed the beer.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
4062,"2003-03-31",3.5,"hazy yellow with a somewhat firm head.  good gueuze aroma with cirtus coming out right alongside the wet hay.  i found this beer to be much more mild than many other tasters.  i thought that the flavor was very mild, meaning that i thought it had a really good balance between the lambic sour flavors and the citrus notes.  the light body made it so smooth and soft too.","San Diego, California, USA","akinm"
4062,"2003-03-11",3.2,"Just a total explosion in all respects that catches every part of the palate off guard, thats for sure! It pours a yellowy orange mix...more towards the orange side with no head. Definite aroma's of peach, lemon, citrusy to hell, and other fruits perhaps. The taste begins with a tarty sourness and then EXPLODES into a lemony, citrusy tartness on the sides of the tongue and back of the throat! Completely taste bud draining, thats for sure..it beats the hell out of the palate. Like sucking on an orange sourball and then getting hit by a high carbonated soda explosion. Very sour and acetic..but decent.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"
4062,"2003-03-09",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2010 Re-Rate - Had from bottle at Belgian Beer Party at Pizza Port Carlsbad on March 27, 2010 - 2006 Vintage#51 on the program, this was the 2006 vintage of Cantillon Iris.  This was my first bottle of the day, and as such, one of the first ones opened.  It was still cold, and uncorked for my tasting.  It pours a brown/amber color with a spare, fizzy head and good lacing.  The Iris is clear throughout with no particles.  The nose is both sweet and sour.  Aromas of flowers, hops, yeast, and fruits.  A very complex, yet satisfying nose.  Flavors are similarly complex, tasting slightly bitter with citrus dominating the flavors and an acidic finish.  The Iris is very drinkable and finishes well.  A fine start to my morning/afternoon festivities.Original Rating:Had from bottle at The 12 Hour Belgian Beer Party at Pizza Port Carlsbad on March 8, 2003#47 on the program.  After sampling the Cantillon Rose de Gambrinus just a few beers prior, I had hoped for something a bit sweeter than what I got.  Luckily I got some of the last bottle...but my taste buds were not ready.  The beer hits you hard with a strong vinegar/acetic taste.  The aroma is similar - a bit sour with a hint of alcohol.  A very complex beer with a chalky finish and a soft carbonation.  Not my favorite of the Cantillon family (I would have to recommend the FouFoune)...","Orange, California, USA","Blake"

4062,"2003-01-02",4.0,"Extremely sour, lactic nose and taste. Smells almost like a clogged drain at first - better to let it breathe. Cloudy orange-brown color and very fizzy. Grapefruit-like tastes. Deposits a sharp dollop of sourness on the roof of the mouth before the swallow. Chalky finish that evaporates quickly. Challenging but worth the effort.","GERMANY","pivo"

4062,"2002-10-04",3.2,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2009 Brown-tinted orange; big aroma - wood, slightly toasted hops, sour apple - typical Cantillon for the most part; starts off like any quality gueuze, fairly complex though a tad sweeter than other non-fruited Cantillons.  Its the finish that gets me.  Bitter.  Astringent.  Unpleasant.  I understand that the hops are the gimmick of this beer, but to me the finish just clashed with everything else and ruined it.  Experiments fail sometimes - thats life.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
4062,"2002-09-29",4.0,"aroma is a curious mixture of crisp green grass and olives with the more routine cantillon odeur de pissoir publique. this could however have been due to motelpogo pissing on a nearby tree when i was sticking the schnozz in. brutal stomach-assaulting sourness of course, as we expect and demand from cantillon, along with full maltiness by lambic standards, and grapefruity bitterness. texture is juicy, full and smooth. yup.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"

I cant say I liked this one that much: the bitterness of the hops overpowers the fruitiness of the body and the finish is astringent and slightly metallic.","Buffalo, New York, USA","estoppel"
4062,"2002-09-12",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2003 2001:  The aroma is the only great aspect of this beer; It boasts fresh, round floral hop, a little spice, and some earth and iron.  Straw-like flavors prevail one dimensionally.  Texture is soft along with being typically acidic and dry; tiny bubbles.  Back throat bitterness lingers and astringency cuts like a knife.  Not quite up to the Cantillon standard.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly hoppy (flowers, grass), moderately yeasty (cheese, barnyard, cobwebs), with notes of pear syrup, cask wood, and sour apple, hint of honey. Flavor is lightly to moderately sweet, heavily acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately to heavily acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety/watery texture, lively carbonation, moderately astringent.

Not too sour taste in which I detected hops, yoghurt, citrus, oak, pineapple, pinetree and mango. In fact too much to describe. Amazingly complex lambic beer. With every sip you discover more tastes and aromas. One of the great beers of this world!
