4572,"2015-04-29",4.0,"Bottle: 30 of 60. Super hazy, bright yellow body. Nearly opaque center, crackling white foam on tap thats gone fairly quick. Big musty barnyard aroma; moldy cotton, heavy Brett, wet hay, nice floral & earthy undertones with spikes of citrus zest, orange, pear, & lemon peel. Flavor shows a more mineral & acidic side with larger notes of peach, lemon, & orange. Citric with a vivid tartness. Still retains a nice helping of the brettanomyces funk; wet wood, barnyard floor, heavy must. Finishes on a small acidic bite with a touch of lacto & soft, soured wheat. Delicious.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
4572,"2013-01-23",4.0,"Bottle 29 of 60. Pours gold with white head. Nose and taste of sweet orange peel, wild yeast, banana, clove and light spicy wheat. Medium body. Finishes with a delicate tartness and hint of dried orange peel.",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
4572,"2012-11-23",3.0,"750mL bottle, pours a cloudy golden yellow with a medium white head. Aroma of barrels, sweet and tart orange peels, and dry wheat. Flavour brings out some white wine-like barrels, though subtly, with dry, sweet and tart orange peels, the usual wheat and some light citric notes. Quite a decent amount of complexity for a witbier, no doubt due to the barrels and orange peel. Though this is not exactly that exciting, its very refreshing and more interesting than a standard wit.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

Touch of citrus.  Really smooth and easy drinking with just a touch of acidity.  Delicious.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
4572,"2012-04-23",4.0,"Bottle. Pours a clear gold with no head whatsoever. Aroma has a slightly tart note with some backing sweet orange peel and a hint of underlying gin.

4572,"2011-12-28",4.4,"750ml bottle, #33 of 60.  Poured carefully, the initial glass is a crystal clear, bright golden straw color.  Despite a well-settled bottle and a steady hand, each successive pour is increasingly hazy, though still quite softly so.  Never ending streams of fine micro-bubbles streak towards the surface, feeding a small, off-white ring of foam at the head.  Thin bands of hard lace circle the glass.  The nose is based in dusty, dried wheat malt, showing the very clear effects of Belgian farmhouse yeast.  Orange peel spicing seems more dry and pithy than oily and sweet.  I get a good amount of lemon pith too.  The barrel imparts a dry vinousness, lending suggestions of a crisp, grassy Albariño.  A slight bit of Berliner-like lactic tartness is a beautiful touch.  Flavors compliment the nose perfectly, coming across crisp, lemony, pithy, and tart.  Lactic acidity adds a zippy bite, working with the yeast to slice and dice its way through the cereal wheat malt.  Notes of dry Spanish white wine, grassy, lemony, and slightly mineral-like, linger on the tongue.  The palate is as light and crisp as the flavor asks it to be.  Theres a touch of creaminess to the wheat base, keeping it smooth up front, before the fine, lively carbonation and sharp lactic acidity clean the palate off on the back end.  Mmmm....great warm weather beer.  Excellent stuff.  Upright continues to impress.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
4572,"2011-11-12",3.9,"Pours a lightly cloudy orange yellow with a tall white head.  Very floral in nature with spices and orange peel.  Lots of apples, a light lemon, lactic, and a little bit of oak.  Apples, pears, lemon, and lactic notes.  Some oak, spice, and some wheat bread.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
4572,"2011-09-01",3.8,"Bottle extra thanks to Chuck! Gold pour with a fluffy white head.  orange zest on the nose with hints of funky acidity.  Light acidity and prickly carbonation through out. Barrel aging took a lot phenolics out yielding the house botanicals Ive grown to love w/ this brewery","raleigh, North Carolina, USA","ucusty"
4572,"2011-08-20",3.7,"bottle... medium milky straw, nice white head... smells outstanding, sour but sweet saison, musky a touch of oranges and bit of honey... the taste is much lighter so its disappointing as the flavors dont burst as much as the nose, really light, almost watery, more barrel shows, a touch of grass with a sweet note... pretty solid","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
4572,"2011-07-22",3.8,"Upright barrel aged wit. 750ml purchased and consumed at the tasting room... Pours a hazy golden light brown pour and topped with a creamy white head...  Somewhat skunked tart orange and lemon base. Lessm wine influence than expected which come through more in the flavor...  
Flavors are tart with lemon and semi-sharp acidic citrus notes. White wine prickly acidity all throughout. Completely drinkable but s Mewhat off for the wit style. The wine barrel aging was a slight improvement since the regular wit is pretty. Damn solid on its own.
