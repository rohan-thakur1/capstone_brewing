Appearance - the body has a pale sunglow, with a 2"" off-white head that hangs out.
Taste - has an amazing mix of juicified hops, that are tropical (pineapple, mango, starfruit, lemon, grapefruit, and even guava). There is also some minor pine, floral, pungency, and herbal hop qualities. There is a vegetal element that is slightly celery seed, even could be described as scallion. Impressive mix.

4012,"2015-07-31",4.4,"Pours a completely unfiltered, vibrant, peach pulp color, with a very stable, froth head.

Exhibits an intense nose of watermelon stones and wet grass, together with orange peel and a whiff of ice-bonbons. The aromas come outstandingly well together, extremely dank, with just the right amount of fruits to create a fantastic, intriguing hop character. Crisp, juicy citrus joins in, as the beer warms up, lending the hops even more profile.

Has a medium carbonation, revealing an awesome hop profile, while letting the beer stay extremely refreshing. For its 6.6 abv it packs a great flavor diversity, leaving the palate very satisfied.

The taste begins, from the very first glance, with grassy lime, silk yeast and bready, balancing malts. Lemons evolve into sweeter, ripe oranges with a distinct grassiness to them, very dough on the palate, packing enough fruits to create an enjoyable hoppy juicyness. Finishes with a great, leafy dankness, bringing up the citrus again, providing a hoppy, bitterness infused dryness, which leaves the palate at the same time as the fruits do.

Head is white, full, very stiff.Dry-tangerine, light, white grapefruit pith and bits of melon in the nose give way to light pale malt honey. Clean, with no garlic/scallion, no astringency and no yeast blandness, nor alcohol. With warming we get more sweet melon leading in to moderate juicy fruits. Good, though the tangerine-grapefruit is a bit pervasive.Very bitter, white grapefruit and unripe-tangerine character brightens the palate up front as honeyed maltiness balances through the middle and unlocks a juicy fruit/watermelon finish with supple, soft dextrines and tight, fine carbonation that make for an endlessly comforting texture. Though it helps balance the prominent bitterness, it may be just a touch too sweet, in the end.Quite similar to the Mosaic dry-hopped version that was released 2 months prior. This one seems a good deal more bitter and perhaps unidimensional (and I think I like mosaic a lot more than Galaxy). Great, though, and very clean with no astringency or blandness whatsoever from either yeast or hops.  At this point, Im just giving these things 5 for appearance.  The head retention is incredible and the particulate never drops no matter what you do (obviously they arent fining it).  7/5/8/4/16Draught at Publick House, 5/25/16A nice looking glass of soup, but with a strong head.  Better than remembered, even, despite my previous rating being a 4.0.  Just phenomenally juicy, with less capsaicin-like character that I associate with Galaxy hops.  In fact, its got no resin, no twang and is just pure melon-mango-lemon bliss.  Hell of a pint, could drink this all night.  Score is for this current batch.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

4012,"2014-11-16",3.7,"Thanks to Andrew for this rarity. Lightly bronzed golden pour, opaque to a degree and retaining a thin film of white. Prickly pear and green garlic scape aroma. Stinging notes of tangelo and pineapple seeming more sharply acidic than glowing or juicy. Saltwater taffy reveals a tiny touch of butter. It is overall staunch and pungent, and on the greener side, which is enjoyable; the brilliant fruit notes of its class of peers are quieter here.

Green garlic, green banana, and sweet grass are the leading flavors; rather unusual but expressive. Strangely, even the buttery coloring here thats impossible to dismiss has a certain greenness to it. Fucking grass fed dairy. Apart from this, the kiwi, fresh grass clippings, scallion and tarragon are effusive and cooly pungent; this is one of the greenest presentations Ive ever experienced. There are pepper and mineral undertones, but little in the way of sturdy supportive malt; it is in fact hard to separate the slippery butter notes from what feels like a pinch of crystal malt.

The palate here is crisp with some pleasant mineral character and drying blonde malts. The lurking astringency of sweet tea malt consistently competes with the elegant greenery of the hops. The finish brings back this grass fed butter thing and some herb oil. Its rather hard to accurately characterize whats to like and dislike here; its surely a net positive.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Anyways, 32oz growler in a tulip. Pours hazy golden with a lacy, white head. Aroma strong of tropical fruits and citrusy hops and a nice balance of from the light malts. Flavor the same with an incredible, fruity, citrusy hoppiness. Average texture. Omg, Wow, Holy crap. What an insanely good beer.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"

4012,"2014-08-25",4.1,"Galaxy dryhopped edition shared by Miche & Marheb, thanks a lot people of Montreal! Pours a hazy light golden with a medium white head that offers really good lacing. Nose is almost of pure tropical fruit juice, mangoes, peaches and apricots but there is some slight perfume in the finish as well. Taste is moderately bitter, offers some light cereals, more fruity hops and some good supporting sweetness. Body was medium, carbonation moderately high. Overall a really nice pale ale, Id drink a lot of that if it were local to me!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
4012,"2014-08-24",4.2,"Bottle (750 ml). Dry hopped w/ galaxy version. Shared by Marheb & Miche, thanks! Hazy pale yellow/golden with a medium white head and good lacing. Aroma is stunning with dank hops, grapefruits, pine, mineral notes, nice herbal presence, light malt... super hoppy, but also really ""complex"" for the style. Taste is also dominated by grapefruits and pine with a light but effective malt backbone, very light bitterness and dank hops. Alcohol is really well hidden. Medium body. Soft carbonation. Creamy/fluffy mouthfeel. Slightly oily too. Dry finish. Really tasty and super drinkable/quenching. Wonderful stuff. One of the best Pale Ale I ever had. On the same level as HF Edward. Loved it!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Taste is powerfully bitter, moving to slightly nutty and quite aggressive with full hop power. Palate is big grapefruit juice, complete hop content into the long finish. Really good.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
