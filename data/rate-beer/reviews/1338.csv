1338,"2017-01-26",3.7,"this 25.6oz bottle is about 3 years old and labeled Limited Edition and 8.3% abv

poured a hazy medium amber with a nice 1/2"" head that has minimal retention. the aromas are sweet malts, strong maple, spices and cherry. there is also a hint of alcohol, after all this one is 8.3%.
the sweetness of the maple and the malts dominate this beer. there is plenty of cherry flavors too along with a bit of caramel. the bitterness kicks in towards the end as it hits the palate with slight alcohol warmth.
this beer has med to full body, creamy and rich texture, medium carbonation and minimal astringency.
the finish is long with lots of maple sweetness and lingering bitterness and alcohol.
overall not my style of beer but I can see how some other drinkers will love this one. its complex and rich. 
the good news is that it has aged incredibly well. there are NO signs of any oxidation or other over-aging off flavors or aromas.","Miami, Florida, USA","Rumbero"

Great taste - the sweetness has very interesting notes, I would have guessed at honey, but presumably its maple syrup. There are some gentle wooded notes adding balance and plenty of interest to the taste. Theres some pleasant rather restrained bitterness in the finish which is sustained and takes with it some of the interesting and unusual flavours.

1338,"2014-09-20",3.9,"Transfer from BA review on 8-11-13-

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The brew pours a copper-amber color with a billowy just off white head. The head had a lighter level of retention, fading rather fast to leave light lacing on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma was sweet being a mix of darker fruits of cherry and fig as well as a maple syrup and caramel smell. Along with these sweeter smells so too comes some nice oak and biscuity malt aromas. A little bit of alcohol and spice also comes to the nose creating a warming sweet woodsy smell overall.

 Taste  The taste starts out with a sweeter caramel and lighter dark fruit flavors of cherry, plum and fig. Along with the sweeter flavors upfront are some biscuit malty flavors as well as a little bit of oak. The oak grows stronger while the biscuit loses strength as the taste moves on. Along with the biscuit fading so too does some of the caramel only to be replaced by a more candied sugar, toffee and maple syrup taste. In the end the oakiness mixed with some alcohol booziness to give a sweeter whisky like taste which when combined with all the fruit, sugar and light malty tastes ends up leaving a smooth, sweet, and warm taste to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel- The body of the brew is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. The thickness is quite nice for the sweeter flavors of the brew with the lighter carbonation helping to create a more warming feel in light of the boozy and oaky flavors of the brew.

 Overall  A rather enjoyable brew overall. It is sweet of maple, fruit and other sugars but is balanced out by some of the wood, boozy and biscuit malt flavors of the brew. A nice one to give a go to.","","Darkmagus82"
1338,"2014-09-11",3.2,"Tastes like every other Innis & Gunn beer - malty, syrupy, sweet, etc. However this one is better than usual because the typical I&G oak palate rape isnt occurring; instead a nice velvety flavour from the cherrywood comes through and fades into the maple syrup and malts quite nicely.","St. Albert, Alberta, CANADA","MunBro"

And a little light smoke. A light lemony hop flicks briefly across the tongue before an oak and vanilla finish.

Head is glazing white, similar to the snow thats everywhere here, fresh, fluffy and full with about a half inch head and some nice lacing. Aroma is sweet, oak chips, apple, mild soft pear, cherry, raspberry, and dried figs. Taste is oak, sweet oak, sugared orange slices, raw vanilla, cherry flows in as expected, then this mayple syrup counteracts with the cherry and melds the offerings of this into a nice take on a scottish ale. Bitterness remains light and present, yet the cherry and vanilla flavor shines more with it. A very full and satyisfying brew, the sweetness is tame and marvels with the mayple syrup, and the woodchip aging only brings a satyisfying brilliance to this. Getting some rum in the aroma as well, abv is perfect for this excellent brew, big and bold and enjoyable. Very nice.","Pittsfield, Massachusetts, USA","PhatB420"

1338,"2013-08-21",3.4,"Single from the LCBO, in their usual boxes for their special brews. Second Innis & Gunn of the night. Pours a clean deep amber colour with an off-white head, decent retention and a little lace. The aromas are mild, but pretty complex, changing as it breathes. Starts with dark fruits (plums, dates), then, roasted malts, burnt wood, butterscotch, cherry notes and other fruity malts. The mouthfeel is stuck between wet and syrupy, light and medium-bodied. A little on the sweet side, but not too much to kill things. Lots of the flavours seems like the nose. If there is any maple syrup in this, it is very well-blended. An interesting Scottish beer matured in the Cherrywood. Worth trying, just a little too sweet and syrupy to enjoy more. I think I prefer their original Canadian Oak matured beer.","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"
1338,"2013-08-19",4.3,"Pours a deep maroon colour, with a small off white head. The aroma is rich and complex, with notes of wood, cherry, cough syrup, and scotch. The taste is also very complex and deep, with notes that include cherry, roasted maple, caramel, toffee and other rich deep malts. Wood, peat, and syrupy, the beer leaves an oily texture in the mouth and a sweet aftertaste.

The brew smells like cherries, wood, maple, and bready malt. I think the taste mostly follows the aroma, with the cherry and wood flavors being the strongest. Its a sweet, fruity ale.

1338,"2013-07-19",2.9,"Right out of the bottle
yes maple syrup and bananas with a very light lime/lemon hop slight aftertaste. A bit too sweet for me. Might taste good on pancakes if you make a reduction.
Creamy and a smooth sweet caramel. Maybe plum/dried prune style honey on the palate. Low carbonation
Alcohol is well hidden for 8.3%. Very drinkable but in a maple marshmallow with a hint of lemon way. Cannot taste any wood or cherry but I finished a chimay a little while ago.
Still a well crafted beer but more of an aperitif type and having a one off is enough. Iwas thinking colder might be better but I suspect it would even intensify the honey sweet on the mouth.
Quality beer and my ratings are low mostly because I likes my sours. I was hoping for more of the cherry the box mentions","toronto, Ontario, CANADA","buffalojump"
