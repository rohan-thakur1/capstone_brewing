Why do I mention that here instead of re-rating? Mainly because I dont feel like but also to emphasize how much more I liked this one. (side note, what ridiculous nonsense is it to call this an English Pale Ale or Bitter, it has nothing at all to do with that style, not even the slightest little bit). Well this is a great hoppy pale, big citrus nose and flavors, nice balanced palate with dry clean malts, lightly bready, medium bitter finish. Plenty of good citrus and floral notes.

1885,"2017-03-14",4.3,"from a 16 oz can. --
Aroma: hop derived aromas (tropical fruit i.e papaya, mango and citrusy grapefruit) and spices overpower malt derived aromas which are just very subtle.
Appearance: poured into an IPA glass, this pale golden ale displays a lovely one inch thick head with just moderate retention. starts with slight hazyness but clears completely as it warms. decent lacing is observed.
Taste: incredibly smooth balance of tropical flavors, malt sweetness and just the right amount of hop bitterness.
Palate: medium/light bodied with a thin-ish (in a good way) but oily texture. moderate carbonation and significant astringency touching the palate.
The finish is dry with a slow fading astringency.
Overall: this is a very fine session IPA really. the Citra hops shine here on the nose and tongue. Incredibly balanced, drinkable and thirst quenching. I want more...","Miami, Florida, USA","Rumbero"

1885,"2016-05-20",3.8,"Canned 3/23/16, drunk 5/11/16.Clear, apricot-peach colored golden body has large bubbles in solution and a small, off-white head that immediatley fizzles to nothing. Reminds me of Headroom from Trillium. Is this a citra thing?? I really have no idea, but its bizarre to see a head audibly fizzling to literally nothing very quickly in a pale ale.Anyways, the nose is an ultra clean, woody, citric, brightly hopped aroma with light cracker and such backing it lightly. No alcohol, absolutely no flaw. Obviously this can is way past when it should be rated, so I was going to open it and drink it more as a test of the brewing quality. After the hops fade, its decidedly easy to pick up on any brewing flaws. But here, nothing. No wax, cat, garlic, scallion; none of that. Just beautiful cracker and biscuit-like malts with clean minerality, and soft, dusty, dry, leathery citrus that citra is known for. Seems every bit as good as the best and Im happy to rate it based on how even more delightful a fresh sample must have been.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1885,"2016-05-12",3.7,"16 Oz can at World of Beer (Naperville, IL). Excited to finally try this. Pours a decent hazed and dulled golden hue, a harvest color with frothy whitish head atop that stays as a filmy layer, thicker ringer and OK lacing. Aromas are dry, bitter, citric and floral. Firmer grapefruit, soap, earth and cleaner malt bill. Mango and a bit of tropical nectar, pollen, florals, earthy bitterness. Initial lighter bodied, a bit more dull on the hop bitterness off the bat than the nose lets on. Mango, bitter rind, florals and a fruity allure. More floral, green bitterness as we press on. A more flabby carbonation, dulled bitterness. A bit of spiciness, lingering Citra fruity appeal is sufficient. Some pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit pithy appeal as we round the corner. A bit grassy, bitter, soapy and fruity as we finish up. A more dulled pour, appealing potent nose. The beer itself is light but perhaps a touch under bittered and carbed.

1885,"2016-04-01",3.2,"Agressive pour results in only a small, thin, white head that recedes very quickly to a thin rim with no lacing. Very nice citrus aroma, but not much else; simple aroma, no complexity. Clear and golden color. Moderate to light carbonation. Thin mouth feel. Piney bittering on the initial taste, persisting through the middle, but ending in a pleasant aftertaste with the bittering still lingering, but where what malt there is presents itself. The simplicity of the aroma and the dominance of bittering with little flavor contribution from the citra hops is disappointing, even more so given the competitions much more successful use of citra. This is one of those ""for a"" beers... enjoyable ""for a"" session ale, so as a summer ""boat beer"" most will find it more than acceptable. But no complexity at all, little flavor, and the thin body results in a less than desirable pale ale. And, even within the ""session ale"" (below 5% ABV) category, it is near the bottom of the pack from those that I have tried. There are much better session ales out there, including *most* of the Minnesota-brewed session ales.","Minnesota, USA","MNAle"
1885,"2016-04-01",3.9,"Can. Pours clear brass color with very little head. Nose is mild Citra. Mango and maybe a little metallic. Taste is creamy tropical. Flavor won't blow the back of your head off but very pleasant drinking beer.","Iowa, USA","arnold931"
1885,"2016-04-01",3.0,"Can from Johns - into glass. Pour is nearly clear yellow with a quickly dissipating layer of white foam. Unassuming appearance. aroma is light mango, pineapple, and citrus with faint sweetness. Light and clean aroma. Palate is a touch undercarbed for my taste. Flavor is light citrus and mango with a biscuit malt presence. Finish is a little peppery and a little bready. Crushable but not all I had hoped for.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"
1885,"2016-03-30",3.7,"Picked up a four pack from Heritage Liquors in Maplewood, Minnesota. Pours a semi-clear golden straw colored brew with a thin white head that quickly dissipates to a film top and average white ring. Aroma of lots of tropical and grapefruity Citra hops with a hint of golden grain malt. Taste is light bodied and has more toasted golden grain malt flavors than the tropical fruit hop presence compared to the aroma. Finish is light, mildly bitterness that quickly disappears leaving some toasted golden grain aftertaste. A sessional pale ale? You darn tootn it is.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
1885,"2016-03-29",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2016 Pours a clear straw color with minimal head and lacing. This one is better left in the can. Aroma is fresh, dank citrus and some hay. Taste is fruity and dry with crisp carbonation and pale cracker malts. Not quite as good as I remember Citra Sunshine Slacker to be, but to be fair that one is more my style as a straight Session IPA and this one is a bit more ambiguous. No matter what you call it, I love this style of beer, and it seems best suited to be experienced from a cold can on a hot summer day in the middle of a lake. And its cheap.","Minnesota, USA","Ericular"
1885,"2016-03-29",3.5,"March 29, 2016 - can from AV3. Clear golden pour into my Surly pint glass with nice amount of head that faded rather quickly. Very nice tropical fruit / citrus aroma. Taste was a bit mild, but nicely balanced. This will be a great summer beer and $6.99 for a 4 pack of 16 ounce cans seems like a steal.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"

Pours lightly hazy & pale as straw... The head is small but well retained. 

The aroma is bright & hoppy with orange, melon, & white grape. Its got a reasonably dank character to it. Very inviting!

The flavor is great, nicely dry with a light toasty malt character. The hoppiness is bright and orange like with a very mild but ever present level of bitterness. 
 Love beers like this","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
1885,"2016-03-28",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 30, 2016 Can from Vinfera. Gold pour with a modest white head. Aroma is dominated by the citra. Plenty of tropical fruits. Grapefruit and passion fruit. A bit of underarm. A bit musty. Some straw. Flavor is fairly bitter. Extremely dry. Restrained pale malt back bone. Hay. Lightly chalky. Mild citrus and white grape. Light body, strong carb.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
1885,"2016-03-11",3.4,"Draft at Grumpys. Clear yellow color. Aryof bitter kemon. Taste is similar.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
1885,"2016-03-11",3.0,"Clean pale gold, negligible head forming. Early signifiers are lime zest and unripe mango, with scallion and burnt corn kernels, gritty earthiness. Almost papery, ashy, like the burnt casing of grilled sweet corn. The flavor is even more forward, and after an initial blast of scorched onion skin, larger gulps reveal some juicier lime and apricot bristling with pine needles. Burnt seeds and dry cracker for malts. Thin palate, streamlined, crisp carb; the aggressive and pungent bitterness is the lasting impression, though a touch of floral honey lingers momentarily at the end.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
1885,"2016-03-05",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2016 On tap at Grumpys NE. Pours a near clear gold with a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a good amount of oniony citrus with a bit of pine with some earthy grain underlying. Flavor has earthy citrus with some earthy pine and some sweet grains supporting.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
1885,"2016-03-05",3.8,"Tap @ Grumpys. Pours a kinda hazy gold. Tons of citra on the nose, taste is more citra, actually really nice. Surly crushes this.","Robbinsdale, Minnesota, USA","TheHOFF43"
