1665,"2017-04-27",3.4,"Can supplied by Sun King for review. Since this does not have nitrogen in the can, it kicks up a rocky, foamy tan head that lets me try to create what we used to call a ""TV beer."" And yes, I do have a proper ""thistle"" glass for stouts, but it has the Goose Island logo from all angles, so I dont want to cause confusion.
The smell is not strong, but does carry just a bit more roast malt than the standard stout. The taste is a little sweet, aided by the CO2 carbonation, with a little bit of marshmallow, and just a tinge of ""soured"" beer. The finish holds on the a bit of sweetness, including a bit of stickiness on the lips.
Its low alcohol makes this a sessionable beer, but just a bit of sweetness means it should be considered during a meal as well.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
1665,"2017-04-27",3.2,"This canned brew from a bottle shop was served at a cool temperature and poured a head of foamy finely sized dark brown colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind no visible carbonation opaque dark black brown colored body and a poor lacing. The mild aroma was hoppy brown malt and dark malt. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a mellow mild vinous hop aftertaste. The ok flavor contained notes of mild hops brown malt and dark malt. An OK brew just nothing special.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1665,"2017-04-02",3.4,"Draft. Pours very dark brown with a decent khaki head that settles to nothing with no lace. Nose involves toasted malt, a dash of chocolate, some roast, not a lot of aroma. Fairly sweet, fair bitterness. Medium bodied, soft carb, finishing on the dry side with roastiness. Decent stout.","North Central, Indiana, USA","574deadzone"
1665,"2017-03-25",3.3,"It pours very dark with a dense tan head. It has a smooth body with soft carbonation. The taste has muted roasted malt, cream and mild chocolate. Its okay for the style, but not my favorite style.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
1665,"2016-06-15",4.1,"Huge thanks to StFun for this beer. Ring of Dingle has a name thats annoyingly silly to say, but theres absolutely nothing irritating about the taste. Thick pour with black liquid. The head is pretty but perhaps not as pillowy and long-lasting as for some Irish Dry Stouts. Roasted barley and cocoa on the nose. It tastes like it smells and smells like it tastes. Roasty, chocolaty - subtle creaminess. Very rich yet exceptionally smooth. Finish is quick and mellow. This brew is totally lacking in bitterness, harsh graininess, or metallic flavors. Reminds me a lot of Murphys, and I mean that in the best way.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"
1665,"2016-04-17",3.4,"Can thanks to Stfun. Pours a dark browb with a medium creamy beige head that lasts. The aroma is dark fruit and roast. Medium mouth, roast and earthy malt, light dryness, good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
1665,"2016-04-10",3.6,"16 oz. can, from StFun. Black color, with a dark brown, fizzy head. The aroma is bittersweet chocolate, chicory, caramel, and light smoke and tobacco. Fairly dry and toasty, with a little bitterness. Medium body, sticky, and nicely grainy. This is a solid, delicious, and pleasantly aggressive and dry.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"
1665,"2016-03-18",3.7,"Aromas of soy sauce, roasted malts, cocoa. Taste is Irish soda bread, soy sauce, cocoa, roasted malts, light tart berries.","","Dorkenstein"
1665,"2015-03-13",2.7,"On tap, poured into a sampler. Mellow chocolate and coffee aromas are noted coming from the dark, near opaque, caramel colored beer. Its topped by a dense, beige, soap head that retaims a medium thin ring, and leaves an abundant, messy lace. The taste is a medium light bittersweet. The beer is fizzy and thin with a light, smokey chocolate and coffeee. Its mellow and muted with a dry, coffee like finish and an aftertaste thats dry with notes of dark chocolate.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"
1665,"2015-03-04",3.6,"Jet black, thick dark brown head that fades quickly. Roasty aroma, smooth, medium body. Like a thinner Guinness, decent, but for the money, I'll stick with the original.

1665,"2015-01-15",3.2,"June 2014. Sampled in Bloomington, IN - 16oz can. Black pour with a small tan head, mild lacing. Coffee and dark chocolate on the aroma, biscuits, a touch of caramel. Roasty flavor, coffee, dark chocolate, a touch of sweetness, a hint of minerals and booziness. Too strong to be a dry Irish stout, but not bad.","Georgia, USA","drowland"

1665,"2014-08-17",3.9,"Thanks, Trent, for the 16 ounce can!

It pours black with a tan head of foam. A pretty big head of foam that shrinks to a fine layer.

Plenty of fine roasted malt in the nose though i do get some aroma that I usually associate with a Milk Stout. And yes, theres some hoppy bitterness here too along with some smoke?

The taste is so roasty and nice with a cool presence of smoke. I get some dark and milk chocolate notes and the bitterness is on the light side. Dry? Yes, but not as dry as others of the style that Ive had. Thats not a knock on ROD. I quite enjoy it.

Medium bodied, a light level of carbonation, the smoothness is in a bit of an overkill stage.

Yep, this is a fine Dry Stout. Id say that if the carbo was bumped up a little, Id like it even more.","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"
1665,"2014-08-12",3.4,"deep black with about a half inch light brown head. Light aroma of semi sweet chocolate and roasted malt.

1665,"2014-07-21",3.6,"16 ounce can

A late Saint Patricks Day treat, this release typifies the average Sun King canning. While it has a bit of an expensive price tag for a day to day beer it would not hurt to grab a four pack once a year. I cant wait to see Sun King expand into other markets.

Aroma / Appearance - A fluid black base swirls the glass with a murky texture. Soft tan head idly sits on top like film over a dusty glass of water. Light chocolate, coffee, malts, and smoky licorice reward the eager nose with fresh feelings.

Flavor / Palate - A mixture of fluid coffee, sweet fruits, and maltiness warm the throat. A typical American stout is perhaps slightly too heavy to consider sessioning. Even so it would not be tough to drink another can if it were on hand. A malt driven release is a great Midwestern interpretation of a classic spring style.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
1665,"2014-05-24",3.5,"16 ounce can. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. Aroma is nice but very light, it smells like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate and coffee. The brew tastes like roasted malt, coffee, burnt/charred malt, and some dark chocolate and earthiness. Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit creamy and has medium/high carbonation. I thought this was a good tasting brew, although the weak aroma didnt exactly impress me. Its worth trying. $3.99 for a single can.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
1665,"2014-05-06",3.8,"6oz pour at Smoke and Barrel. Nose is really earthy, wet dirt, roasted mushroom, some coffee grounds, a little raisin, some toasted bread crust. Flavor is malty, toast, a little molasses, a little less earthy than the nose, a little soy, brown sugar, some weak coffee. Finishes dry. Smell and flavor dont mesh, but both are still pleasant.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
1665,"2014-05-05",3.7,"Excellent lighter of a body (high in ABV) stout. Coffee, dark chocolate...maybe. Drank this on a warmer day after a couple session IPAs. But memorable nonetheless.

1665,"2011-04-10",3.5,"Sampled on tap at Flat Water (Indianapolis, IN). Pours a nice blackish murky pour, good haze with some lighter brown edges. Nice creamy frothy tannish head sits atop, laces well, stays a more substantial layer. Aromas are roasted black malts, some Irish soda bread, a touch of cocoa, some coffee. Fairly roasty, not that sweet, some toast and biscuits coming into the backend. Initial is medium bodied and roasty and dry off the bat, some coffee and cocoa, a touch of sweetness into the beer, offering some nice roasty dryness throughout the affair. Finish leaves some lingering coffee, roasted malts, toast, and some touches of sweeter biscuits, cocoa, and perhaps a touch of caramel. Dry overall, which I enjoy.
