Deep copper, hazy body, with a big, stable, frothy, lacing, beige head.

Tastes of toast, dark and dried fruits, bread, some caramel, some citric hops.
Medium, slick mouthfeel, with an average carbonation.
Finishes roasty, toasty, bready, a bit fruity, a bit hoppy.

Really nice. Fortunately not as sweet as many Dunkels from Austria, with a good balance between toasty, fruity and sweet notes. Refreshing and easy, despite the roast notes.","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"
1386,"2015-07-16",3.5,"Der Name Rotglut passt wie die Faust aufs Auge für das kupferfarbene Bier. Es riecht aber nicht wie ein Dunkelbier sondern wie ein Rotbier und so schmeckt es auch. Etwas würzig nach Karamellmalz, starke Röstaromen vermischt mit starker Hopfenherbe. Auch Noten von dunkler Brotkruste und Dunkelbrot sind dabei, die kommen vom Roggenmalz. Die Bezeichnung Altbayisch Dunkel ist hier irreführend. Das kann man gut mit dem Ratsherrn Rotbier oder dem Bier4Wedding Rotbiervergleichen und keinesfalls mit einem bayrischen Dunklen. Trotzdem bleibt es ein interessantes und gutes Roggen-Rotbier.","","Bier_Klaus"
