3184,"2015-08-29",2.2,"Reisartig süßlicher Antrunk, was sich im Mittelteil steigert. Süßlich, etwas trocken werdend, dabei sehr weich. /7/10/7/2/7","Köln (Cologne), GERMANY","Koelschtrinker"
3184,"2015-08-29",3.0,"Sampled at 8th Danish Ratebeer Gathering, Ulfborg 2015, day 2. Well I still dont know how to describe and rate sakes. Looks like water. No head. Aroma is mainly alcohol but actually quite faint. Taste is surprisingly soft. Hard to tell what I taste...maybe a soft floral hint and a distant hint of star fruit. Weird stuff.","Oirschot, THE NETHERLANDS, NETHERLANDS","Benzai"
3184,"2015-08-29",1.5,"Bottle at Danish Ratebeer Summer Gathering 2015, Ulfborg. Pours almost clear water. Aroma of warm rice water with a little caramel. Flavour is moderate to heavy sweet. Light bodied. Not very good.","The Hague / Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","kermis"
3184,"2015-08-29",2.1,"At Danish Ratebeer Summer Gathering 2015 in Ulfborg. Day 2. 
All transparent liquid with no head. Potato aroma, rice, caramel some fruits. Sweet flavor, strange and not really for me.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rlgk"
3184,"2014-06-03",1.5,"Bottle. Pours a perfectly clear transparent with just some vague hints of yellow in there. No head whatsoever. Nose has a vague sense of vinegar and just some hint of dry fruit. Taste is definitely quite dry, and completely flat. Seems like a still dry white wine to me. Not my type of drink, though Im trying to get in to sakes a bit.","Snohomish, Washington, USA","maxwelldeux"
3184,"2013-02-10",1.9,"Bottle @ Home, courtesy of HenrikSoegaard. Pours very light champagne, no head light lacings. Aroma of rice, boiled vegetabes, alcohol. Flavor is rice, littte sweet, vegatables, light boozy. Thin to medium body, alcoholic finish. 100213","Hasselager, DENMARK","Camons"
3184,"2011-12-29",2.2,"0.3l bottle. This is a clear pale transparent golden one. Ho head what so ever. The first thing you get when smelling it is old fermented alcohol with some sweet tones. Perhaps also a hint of yellow apple? It tastes also quite alcohol-strong with a dry and almost sour-woody hint towards the finish. A bit to sharp for me.","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"
3184,"2011-12-01",2.6,"Bottle.  Pours a clear yellow hued color.  Super sweet on the nose, toasted rice and warm booze.  A bit of old decomposing fruit rollups on there too.  Odd.  Medium bodied, very sweet, but a cheap sort of sweetness.  This is quite one dimensional, turning to fusel alcohols and ugliness rather quickly.  Sadly, even though its bad, its still more drinkable than a lot of beers that get similar average scores.  Finishes warm and boozy.  Really not a lot going on here.  Sort of sour flavor on the finish that gains of bit of a plastic taste.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
3184,"2011-11-06",1.5,"Not good. Colour is light yellow-green. No head. Aroma is havy fatty-sweet, plastic too. Flavor is heavy sweet, syrupy. Soft carbonation.","Assentoft, DENMARK","Hansen"
3184,"2011-10-31",1.1,"Courtesy of HenrikSoegaard. Clear and pale as water without head. Aroma is very sweet and alcoholic with something that I cannot describe. Flavor is quite sweet. Sweet finish with lots of alcohol. Yuck. This did not encourage me to explore sake further. 281011","Beder, Aarhus, DENMARK","Rasmus40"
3184,"2011-10-29",1.5,"Bottle. From Far-East Trading, AArhus. Clear water colour. Bad aroma. Only week marcipan notes. Low marcipan flavor. Short finish. Watery palate. Bad sake.","Randers, DENMARK","HenrikSoegaard"

3184,"2011-07-20",3.2,"Clear white of color with a note of yellow. An aroma of spice, wood, alcohol, oily and brandy. A flavor of brandy, spice and wood.","Vadum, DENMARK","Enjoyit"
3184,"2011-05-15",2.6,"Bottle, courtesy of fonefan. A slightly colored sake, but just a tad. Rice, some green apples and a touch of higher alcohol in the aroma. Flavorwise its much the same, but more evident on the rice. Warming in the mouth, in a quite pleasant way. Subtle rice and apples in the end. Quite decent, but a bit heavy on the alcohol. 110129","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
3184,"2011-01-29",1.3,"Bottle 30 cl. Courtesy of fonefan. Pours almost crystal clear with a vague yellowish tint. The nose is strangely tart and citric atop a sweet rice base. Medium body, again tart and citric with some rather unpleasant off-notes. Ends tart and dry. Yuck. 290111","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"

3184,"2010-08-12",2.6,"Bottle. Served cold. First of all, Im no Sake drinker but wanted to change it up a bit. Clear with pale yellow tinge. Aroma is very faint, somewhat similar to white wine. Taste is like a mixture of water and white wine, but the alcohol cuts through strongly. Regular beer drinkers could get bombed on this pretty fast i bet, although its not cheap, even for a cheap Sake.","Port Moody, British Columbia, CANADA","turboespresso"
3184,"2007-11-18",2.2,"Bottle, LDB MiddlegateSlight yellowish accent.  Somewhat rough nose of alcohol and balsa wood.  Slight tartness like an underripe pear.  Then it finishes with a mild rice starchiness and a splash of alcohol.  Rather bland, serves to clean rather than invigorate my palate in between pieces of fish.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
3184,"2007-10-01",2.4,"Bottle: Light beige color, nose of sharp earth and pear, some koji and alcohol, light chemical. The flavor has a sweet impact like apple juice and a tangy thin tail with some bubblegum. Not too floral and a bit sharp and thin, just doesnt deliver in the mouthfeel, more like a flat soda with alcohol.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3184,"2007-08-01",0.5,"This is my second sampled sake, despite my earlier decision to not drink sake again. No aroma. Clear watery appearance. Tastes like weak vodka. Flavorless. Im really looking forward to a Pilsner chaser. I promise, this is my very last sake.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
3184,"2004-06-05",2.2,"OK, my first Sake: sulfury, rice and grain nose, pale biege color. Eggy rice flavor with vegetable tastes. Thin and light. Slight burn of the alcohol on the throat. Not so good...","GERMANY","pivo"
3184,"2004-05-24",2.1,"Kind of light yellow - a little bit sulphury nose - soy too - all in all very light. Citrusy taste, like vinegar used in sushi rice. Cold served. Finish is kind of offensive - not good.","New Jersey, USA","YogiBeera"
3184,"2003-12-10",1.2,"UPDATED: JAN 5, 2004 This Korean sake is not a refined one, despite its being called ""the refined sake"" on the label.  It contains all the worst characteristics of Japanese sake, for example it's a touch grainy rather than smooth, and the alcohol is poorly hidden.  Unlike most sake, this Chungha even has a color - a slight yellowish hue.  Worst of all is the lingering bitterness that follows.  This isn't bitterness of the hop variety, but a burning bitterness from perhaps the addition of an herb or from the use of unrefined rice (which probably also caused the yellowish color).  Lastly, there's a bit of sourness.  All-in-all, a very poor example of Korean sake!","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
