3862,"2017-04-28",4.3,"It pours golden with a white head that has moderate head retention. It is fairly clear. There are aromas of rye, tropical fruit, and pineapple. There hops work very well with the rye to give it a unique rye and tropical flavor. In addition the flavors are highlighted by some citrus and grapefruit. It has a moderate body with a moderately high bitterness. The bitterness is high enough to provide a good bite, without being overpowering. Overall, this is an excellent ipa highlighted by the rye and tropical flavors with just enough bitterness for a good punch.","Pinehurst, North Carolina, USA","hman43"
3862,"2017-04-13",3.8,"On draft. Ive heard that Nelson is a ""divisive"" hop, but this might be the first time Ive really noticed it. From the description, I was expecting tropical, grassy, and white wine notes, but I was blown away by how earthy, woody, and spicy it was. The rye malt definitely accentuated the peppery/woody notes from the Nelson. This is interesting and very unique, and Id definitely drink another pint of it, but it wasnt at all what I was expecting.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

3862,"2017-04-01",4.3,"On tap at Republic Seven Corners with commonshawn. Tulip style glass. Much brighter than what is expected from a rye IPA. Cloudiness reminiscent of New England type efforts. Nice white head about a quarter finger in size. Nose is bright and citrus. Taste leans away from the New England juicy style to bring a citrus forward and bitter IPA to the table. The rye asserts itself towards the end with a little bit of a spice characteristic. Lingering citrus rind bitterness but with an underlying knowing sweetness to help prevent ruining the drinking experience. A vibrant effort that only improves as it warms. Other rye IPAs tremble at the thought of going against Alpines full Nelson.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"

Aftertaste shows some bitterness from the hops, but also a lot of perfume and some grass as well. Overall, a pretty well-balanced IPA, but nothing exceptional or really worth searching out - this was fine, but I was expecting a better West Coast IPA from this brewery.

Pour was a medium hazy gold with a thin off white film for a head. Taste was big and hoppy. Those strong hop flavors are amplified in the taste with a nice strong bitterness for a backbone. As soon as the swallow hit, the rye spiciness resonated and dried the finish up nicely. I might say this is the best IPA Ive had all year (but its only February so well see)!

3862,"2016-02-19",4.5,"BBD 6/18/16. Pours a hazy gold with a touch of amber. Outstanding head volume, world class lacing and retention.

World class nose of tropical hops (mango, pineapple), citrus (orange) and a strong dank background over a touch of biscuit.

Heavy light body with a smooth texture that has an oily slick element. World class carbonation with a nice effervescent middle that coats the tongue and a finely bubbled prickly finish.

The flavor profile is borderline world class. Complexity is a bit weak, but the intent is to showcase the Nelson Sauvin hop and that is done in a world class fashion. Balance is perfect for the objective as a subtle cracker biscuit sweetness arrives in the middle to contrast a tasty bitterness that is quite mild for the style. Hop flavor is the name of the game with this one. The flavors of the nose all arrive...citric followed by tropical as the sweetness of the middle allows the tropicals to shine. Then a significant dankcentric element takes command and holds through the finish. The finish hints at dryness initially, but makes a lingering flourish underneath an amazing blend of tropical and dank hop flavor.

3862,"2016-02-09",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 30, 2016 Ive wanted to try this for a while, and was very happy to find bottles at the Last Drop. Relatively light colored pour, good-sized white head with great lacing, nice gentle new-school nose. Wow, Nelson hops are so good. Like citra, but less...citra. The rye is really subtle but its there and its a serious addition. Yep, this is a 100% IPA. Its not just pine and orange rind any more, bitches. 

Further comments: After a few more rounds of this one, the previous rating holds up. Id probably go 4.1 rather than 4.2, but thats splitting hairs. As it gets a bit less fresh, the onions and garlic come out a bit further, but it still pwns my standby Alphadelic by virtue of a less aggressive malt base and less in the way of lingering bitter oils on the tongue.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

3862,"2015-11-25",3.0,"UPDATED: NOV 27, 2015 Draught at Deep Ellum, 11/17/15.Bright tangerine-apricot liquid shows good clarity and a medium-sized white head with moderate retention.I love this hop and the nose does justice to it. Lots of stonefruit, very big and juicy, with bright orange marmalade accents. Theres a good deal of malt behind it, adding lots of honey and white bread-like character. Fresh and highly aromatic, but theres somehow a touch of resin here or sharpness of some sort.  As well, theres a definite plastic note thats quite strong but not terribly bothersome.The flavor confirms this as, though the flavors of the hop are delicious, the beer is just heavily, heavily bitter. Way more than is necessary to balance the pale malt sweetness that creates a medium to medium-full body. With every sip I keep trying to focus and enjoy the flavors, but my palate gets further an further harried by all of this obnoxious bitterness. Nearly exact same situation as with the other beers Ive tried from them lately: duet and hoppy birthday. I have fond memories of Pure Hoppiness, and I dont think my tastes have changed to be less tolerant of heavily bitter IPAs (have always hated em), so I dont really get whats going on with Alpines mediocrity these days (I usually like Green Flash, though I guess they have a high propensity for making overly bitter beers too).

3862,"2015-06-07",4.8,"On tap at Toronado. The pour is a foggy golden yellow with a thick cap of dense white head and some spectacular lace. The aroma is perfect. There is so much resin and citrus that blends with the hops. The flavor is heavy on citrus and resin while being surprisingly hoppy bitter. Then hop bitterness is a different flavor than I'm used to, probably with the Nelson hops. The flavors mesh so well. The mouth feel is perfect. Just thick enough, with a soft subtle carbonation to help it stick even more. Just great. The aftertaste is lingeringly bitter and hoppy with a great citrus. Damn

Was the best beer by far on the menu. Had been a little giddy to read it on the taplist. Havent quaffed this IPA in nearly 3 years; tastes identically to what I had back then, but I probably appreciated this more given that I hardly knew next to nothing about hops. Since Ive been overexposed to the diverse flavors and varieties of otherworldly hops this planet has to offer, this no longer is, at least to me, the unquestionable legendary Nelson Sauvin IPA I once knew.

Pours hazy pale yellowish golden with a rather small frothy white head that leaves lots of trace on the glass while dissipating. Smell is fruity with crackers, white grapes, grapefruit juice, pine needles, minerals, freshly cut grass, pineapple juice, mango, lemon balm, gooseberries and lemon zest. Taste is bitter and fruity with whole grain crackers, grapefruit juice, gooseberries, freshly cut grass, pine needles, grape skins, pineapple juice, unripe mango, lychee and lemon zest.

3862,"2014-06-13",3.8,"Draft at Hopwater Distribution in San Francisco, California. The pour is hazy golden orange with a smallish off white head. Head falls slowly, with nice lacing. The aroma is big citrus tropical hop upfront, opening up to soft fruit and a general dank resin. Engaging nose.

3862,"2013-12-05",3.9,"Bottled last week. 

Light golden with a 3/4 moon of white foam atop and nice clarity. Smells like pineapple, sweet mangos, pine and a gobs of sweet malts. I like the nose, as I do with most Sauvin beers. Flavor is sweet and bitter with good bits of the character from the olfactory. I like the slight oxidation I get in Alpines beers - nice woodiness. If this was in any other kind of beer, Id be upset, but it is well played here. Medium bodied with sharp, tight carb and a semi dry finish. Nice beer.

3862,"2013-11-06",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2013 This beer poured a delicate and brilliant gold with a faint orange hue when held to the light in the room. When held to natural light it is all golden yellow and with a faint greenish presence. Head is cottony, white, and fell slowly leaving spectacular and decorative lace. 

The nose on this is delicate and floral. Bright citrus zest. Its grassy and has a bit of spicy rye. The malt is almost invisible on the nose except for a light clover honey. It has the scent of grape must on it. A sweet white grape with an earthy musk. As it warms it has a wine like nose that is deep and rich without any real heaviness or sugar on it. Theres a bit of pineapple but its very light. Sunny orange is lightly throughout but nothing you can pinpoint. Its ethereal this nose. 

The taste is stellar. Impeccable clarity in the palate. It has the sweet presence of the white wine grape, with its earth and instead of any acidity this beer offers a hop pungency and a tad bitter. The body of the beer is fantastically light. It is as light as water. The malt is but a breath underneath and you dont smell it or taste it but it has to be there. The rye gives it a bit of spice and a bit of an edge. Then that spice tickles the back of the throat as much as the delicate carbonation and thats how smooth it is. The light orange juicy quality of the fruit gives it a sweetness thats not overplayed to sugar. There is grapefruit but its so delicate as to simply be a mouthwatering pleasure. 

This beer is stellar. Its approach to the palate is lightness and grace. it dares you to taste it its so light and then it hits you with an epic hop character that has every taste and aspect of hops. From grass, to a light  herbal spice, juicy fruits, to a dry white wine like finesse. This finishes lightly dry and with much aplomb. Sublime.

Little head for an IPA, only a timid, eggshell ring forms. Aroma is wall to wall tropical fruits; pineapple, mango, tangerines, & passion fruit among other tropical notes. Almost has a ""juice"" vibe to it. Back-end has some nice wet and weedy hops, leafy and lightly bitter. Taste is bursting with the same, great hop-induced tropical fruit notes, the biggest being pineapple and tangerines. The weedy, wet, grassy aspect is more defined on the palate.

Some vinous white wine aroma as well. I can smell this all day. The taste is slightly bitter but not overpowering. The feel is thin but on point for a light IPA. The rye is a tad spicy but not too much. Quite impressive.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Art"

3862,"2013-07-26",4.2,"On tap at the brewpub early this month. Out of many good beers during 9 days in San Diego, this was probably one of the best. And I think one of the reasons I like it so much is that Nelson gives a much more refined, nuanced, and elegant hop profile than the other flavor-of-the-moment American hops. This has a rich, zesty aroma reminiscent of grapes and citrus peel. The flavor keeps with it and combines a bit of spiciness and a soft, succulent kiwi kind of juiciness with some astringency. Really fantastic IPA.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

3862,"2013-07-19",4.4,"Got in a trade with TopsecretWaffle. 22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but was traded fresh. Pours moderately hazy bright golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big mango, passion-fruit, pineapple, peach, lemon zest, tangerine, floral, grass, light pine, bread, light rye, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of tropical/citrus hop notes with a fair amount of malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big mango, passion-fruit, peach, pineapple, tangerine, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, bread, light rye, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of mango, passion-fruit, peach, pineapple, lemon zest, tangerine, floral, grass, light honey, bread, light rye, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible balance and complexity of bright tropical/citrus hop notes with light-moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible IPA! Fantastic balance and complexity of tropical and bright citrus hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Getting pineapple, oranges, rye, lemons, and mangoes.  Taste is disappointing.  Moderately sweet and only a light bitterness.  Tropical fruit, lemons, and rye is the taste.  There was an odd flavor that I couldnt pick out until I read the label, white wine.  And I think thats whats throwing it off for me.  Finish is soapy and that wine taste lingers.  Fairly dry too.  Pretty disappointing for me, been wanting to try this for a while now.  Re-rate 4/30/15 - Tap at Slows!  Aroma is just awesome. Super dank nelson hops and fruit juice. Grapefruit, pineapple, kiwi, green onion, and pine. Taste ridiculously good. Perfect balance of light sweetness, moderate bitterness, and dank hops. Packed with tropical fruit but also get pine, flowers, white grapes, and citrus. Medium body.  High carbonation but so smooth in the mouthfeel. Adds a little creaminess to the oily hop feel.

A: Brackish topaz with a whisp of head. Looks very still and serene.

N: Lime, ruby grapefruit, fresh cut grass clippings. Hints of conifer. Hops overshadow any malt in a good way. There is some biscuit/cracker, and I can follow the nose to some significant mango flavors.

T: Tropical to start, as with Pure Hoppiness, but this has a two tier effect that begins with the mango, grapefruit, pineapple and transitions into the cracker/bread and piney base. Theres a significant amount of bitterness to this which is made all the more prominent by the zest and spice of the rye.

The beer appears hazy and straw yellow with a nice white head and good lace. The aroma is a wonderful bouquet of hops, grapefruit, and citrus. This beer tastes fabulous. It is very smooth and creamy with minimal bitterness. In the finish lurks a subtle hint of warming alcohol. Highly drinkable and enjoyable. World class.

3862,"2012-02-27",4.1,"From notes.  First reviewed 9/30/2010.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip. 

Nelson pours a slightly hazy golden tangerine color, with a foamy white head. Nice retention, with sticky lace all over the glass. Soft carbonation rises up from the bottom of the glass, replenishing the head.

The aroma has soft white grape skin, honey sweetness, a touch of citrus, along with a touch of musk. Aroma is just slightly bitter.

The distinctive flavor of the Nelson Sauvin hops really carrry the flavor, with the rye providing a more complimentary dryness than an overwhelming flavor. White grape, orange rind, some grassiness give it a restrained juicy hop flavor. Other than the rye, the malt really takes a backseat, despite retaining a fragile delicateness.

Crisp and tingly through most of the sip, which combined with the grape flavor gives it a sparkling wine feel. Strong dry character, and it has a little graininess. 

This is a great change of pace from some of the other American IPAs I have been drinking. Still a strong hop presence, but the grape flavor really kicks this beer into a unique area of the palette. Very interesting, and one I would drink regularly if it was available here.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Finishes with some citrus marmalade coming through and mildly bitter aftertaste. Nice beer - love the contrast of fresh feel and dirty Nelson!",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"

Big resin, weed, orange, dry grass aroma.  Hazy yellow with big bubbles and a small head..  Mouth feel and body are almost cask like (drinking it almost room temp as i like them).  The rye is modestly evident in a tightness of the malt bill.. The end is an all over complex bitterness with a bit of pepper and a final savory steak finale.

3862,"2011-09-18",4.6,"A Mes rate. Tap at Alpine.Aroma: Big pine and citrus with plenty of spice from the Sauvin. Just juicy and inviting. Appearance: Very pale, slightly hazy, thin white head.

Served not too cold (a rare treat in America) and the carbonation level could not be any better.Overall: My giddy aunt this is spectacular. The spice and mouthfeel are about as good a tongue party as I have experienced. The rye and earthy malt base holds everything in near perfect balance. The 7% is throughly unnoticable. To the point where if I wasnt driving, Id be throwing pints of this down me until the bartender suggested I had a coffee... There are deeper hints of leather and wood all wrapped up in a dry and moreish citrus and spice dream. Right now, honestly, Im not over stating this, Im struggling to think of a better IPA.

The malt is  lightly sweet and notes of biscuit without anything -- even tacky feel or toast -- detracting from its support of the hop.  This is a fantastic beer. One of the pinnacles of hoppy beers in the last few years. This isnt extreme in anything other than a mastery of marriage of heavy hop and malt, and its major pronouncement of what the Nelson hop can be.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"

How: Bottle 22oz.  Consumed fresh a few days after receiving directly from California through DaSilky1, thanks a lot Todd

In long: Nose of tropical fruits, pineapples and friends.  Taste has a lot of lemongrass, yeast, tropical fruits, scented flowers, honeyed doughy cereals, a light spiciness, freshly cut pine-tree, some fresh grapefruits.  Again, what seems to be a recurrent characteristic of Alpine beers is that everything feels so fresh and vibrant.  I see in the description that rye was used for this beer.  Hmmm.  To be honest, now that I read it I can smell and taste it (although very subtle) but I dont think I would have listed rye as a flavor element if it wasnt for the description.  Anyway, another excellent IPA from California where they have great beers, great weather, hot babes, more  When we compare ourselves to California it seems that the grass is greener on the other side.

Move over Pliny, get out of the way Ephraim/Abner, these guys take it even one step further. Unreal. These were all on tap at Toronado in San Diego. Pours a glowing hazy yellow gold with small head and awesome lacing. Nelson hops from New Zealand equals the juiciest, tangerine and tropical hop resin profile I have encountered. Notes of honey, pepper, peanut brittle, rye malts, cheese. Taste is juicy, creamy, bitter and refreshing all wrapped into one. Amazing IPA that is going to be impossible to top.

In addition to its great size it has incredible lacing. The head stays at least 5-7 minutes and as it falls it falls in chunks and clings to the sides. 

The aroma is nice but a little on the light side, need a tad more of the citrus coming through to be great. What does come through is some sour citrus grapefruit and lemon with only the slightest touch of hops at the end. The hops are almost totally hidden but they come across with a slight soap smell.

The taste is OK, not as great as I was hoping. The start is light, only taste a very little of grapefruit then it fades to the hops which are nice not very bitter. The finish is kinda of soapy, I think thats the rye, that to me almost ruins it.

3862,"2011-02-18",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2011 We tend to associate West Coast IPAs with citrus aromas and flavors with intense bitterness, but not all beers from the left coast follow this mold exactly (thankfully). Alpine Nelson IPA is one that deviates from the style quite well as the flavors here are more in line with tropical fruit and the palate is more refreshing than it is bitter. The result is an IPA thats not quite as robust as youd associate with the style, but the flavor is unique enough to appreciate and enjoy.I poured a 22oz bomber into a tumbler. Appearance: Hazy, mostly translucent dull orange. Small, off-white, soapy head. Retains well and leaves good lacing.Smell: Smells like a fruit juice with aromas of white grape and passion fruit. There is a touch of grapefruit and flowers as well giving the beer a light, non-intimidating aroma. Taste: Alpine Nelson IPA starts out with a typical west coast IPA palate across the front and middle, but takes a huge turn with a fruit juice taste in the end. In fact, it reminds me of Juicy Fruit gum! Flavors of fresh white grapes appear at first, but then turn slightly sour by the end. This beer is not quite as bitter as Id prefer in a west coast IPA, although the fruity flavor is tasty and unique, although a little mild. I tried to pair this with jambalaya but it wasnt bitter enough to handle the spice. Drinkability: The mouthfeel is a little thin, but noticeable soft. Perfectly medium-bodied. It goes down very smoothly and is quite quaffable for an IPA. The hops linger momentarily and there is a slightly drying effect of the mouth, but easily tolerable. The 7% ABV seems about right, if not a little high. Not the kind of beer youd want to session, although one or two servings will hit the spot for sure.Overall, one of the most interesting IPAs Ive had, but far from the best.NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6BRcYKUZcc","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

I havent been a huge fan of the Nelson hop variety, but theyre slowly growing on me with great beers like this. The white grape flavors from the hop are definitely a nice alternative to a style that can be one dimensional. This one gets more interesting the more you sip it.

Aroma is a mix of spicy rye , citrus, and pineapple. Pine and some sweet honey are also in the background.

First taste is a ton of hops. Starts off with citrus, mango, and pineapple. Bitter pine hops come in next and its all balanced by the rye which added some black peppercorns and clove. Alcohol is slightly present but not overpowing and blends nicely with the hops.

Mouthfeel is well carbonated and medium bodied. Head contributed little to the beer.

3862,"2011-01-25",3.8,"Round #1 of my journey into Alpine IPA goodness. Duet and Pure to follow. Poured into a snifter.

4.0 A: Nearly clear golden yellow color. First pour yielded 4+ fingers of head, plenty of carbonation in this one. Final pour was what I wanted: two and a half fingers of fluffy white head with very good retention and plenty of lacing.

4.5 S: Them hops sure are nice. Fruity bouquet of hops, citrusy grapefruit, white grapes, more white grapes, and a grassy muskiness that starts at white grapes. Hints of rye earthy spiciness also poke through. Very nice!

4.0 T: Taste for the most part follows the nose. Lots of white wine hints with grapefruit and an earthy spiciness. If this wasnt carbonated and a bit stronger, I bet you could fool a wine drinker into thinking this was a bottle of Chardonnay. Nice flavors going on here, but needs a bit more kick.

4.0 M: Lighter medium body. Carbonation, as expected, is a bit too high. Other than that, pretty creamy and overall good.

4.0 D: This is my first time with the Nelson hop (as far as I know anyway). The hops are truly in their own category, but I think they could use some help from a mild citrus hop. A little more rye could do wonders for this as well. Still, a very good beer that I enjoyed drinking.

Flavor is another blast of hops, can really only be described as a rough and raw hop character of citrus and earth.  A hop tea.  Malt just didnt make a showing here.  If it was a homebrew, I would think they mashed this at a really low temperature and used malts that lacked much in the way of character.  Light orange in appearance.  Although I ""get"" why some people just go nuts for this, it is reminsicent of the other beers from Alpine I have tried in that the malts are just lacking for me.

3862,"2010-06-20",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 12, 2015 My Bottom Line:
 This India Pale Ales fascinating aroma and flavour profile seem to be solely developed by that magical Nelson Sauvin hop, swinging back and forth between tropical fruit of all kinds, white wine, coconut and lemongrass until a lenient resinous bitterness rises.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam tops the dull bronzed golden. 
-The low carbonation and juicy mouthfeel make this perfumy hop profile even more prominent. I admit I would have preferred something crisper, like their Duets mouthfeel for example.
-The aroma would make the most wonderful sunscreen lotion... 
-Mild cereal toastiness and oily caramel are tasted, but I admit the rye seems to get lost within the talkative Nelson Sauvin. 
-This IPA has lots of detail, lots of drinkability and lots of personality. Another highly engaging brew from this wonderful brewery.

The hops hit you first with a pleasant peach and grapefruit bitterness. Then the malt really takes over mid tongue and dominates the rest of the way leaving a dry finish. The rye malt gets you towards the back of tongue giving a bit of cracker like taste.

Its a very drinkable beer with the hops up front and then the malts coming in and taking over. None of the 7% is tasted. The rye malt adds a different dimension to the beer that you dont get in a regular IPA.","Vista, California, USA","rcubed"

I will say I wasnt to much impressed with the new hop variety. I didnt get the grapefruit aroma the touted on the bottle but more of grassy earthy hops to it. It was nice but having tried this right after their Duet It was a little underwhelming.
The flavor was kind of a nice for Rye. PA and I will say one of the better of that hybrid that I have tasted. It had a good balance of pepper and hop to it and it finished rather dry in the mouth. The feel was light with somewhat a lack of carbonation for me. I think this brew needed more.

3862,"2010-06-01",3.4,"Awesomely pale, basically gold. Could pass for a pils. One of these days a local micro will figure out this is the way to do an IPA. Points for hop intensity, but its pretty weird. Ink, lemon balm and a serious new sneaker rubberiness which I have gotten from Simcoe before and do not like at all. Doesnt taste like Nelson Sauvin as I know it at all, but nor does it taste like a classic west coast IPA. Distinct retronasal strawberries - hops or yeast I wonder? Odd mouthfeel too - chalky and rubbery where youd expect a hit of lively hop acid. Malt is effectively inconsequential but its not out of balance so doing its job perfectly I suppose. Perfectly well put together, but the hop character is just all over the place. That said, I had no problem polishing it off rather quickly.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

3862,"2010-04-30",4.0,"22 oz. bottle shared by foppa78 and the KC Beer Saints.  Thanks again, guys!  Its starting to look like you all shared more with me than vice-versa, so I might have to make a drive over to KC and make up for it.  Awesome to see them using the Sauvin Nelson hop; I actually spent a nice day in sunny Nelson, New Zealand and it is beautiful.  Anyway, from my little bit of notes: pours a cloudy gold color with a creamy off-white head.  Aroma of mellow oranges, maybe tangerines, with piney hops, and some nice floral and herbal notes to complement the caramel malt.  The flavor follows suit, for the most part.  Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a mouthfeel that falls somewhere between malty and juicy.  Great IPA.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3862,"2010-04-26",4.1,"22 oz bottle poured into a snifter.

A-Body is a quite hazy medium to dark golden amber hue. Pours with an approximately 2 finger foamy white head that eventually fades to 1/2 finger and has perfect retention from there. Little lacing is left behind in the glass.

S- Nose is VERY good. The emphasis and highlight is delightful juicy citrus and the rye comes through in the backbone very well. Another great smelling IPA.

T-Mild to moderate citrus is the highlight with a huge rye and herbal background. A small dose of pine comes through for the finish and adds to the increasing falvors of rye, herbal hops and citrus. A mild bitterness lingers-but the remaining citrus and mild pine flavors overshadow the rye bitterness. Interesting because the flavor is more bitter upfront and not really bitter at all at the end-the flavor progression is opposite of most brews.

P-Moderate tingly carbonation and a nice smooth, oily yet light to moderate weight hoppy body.

O-This is a good and quite interesting rye IPA. The mouthfeel and smell are great and the taste is above average. Its a little bit heavy on the rye for me without a big piny hop punch to counterbalance it. The citrus is a great touch-and I wish this were more present than the herbal punch. The herbal/rye combo overshadows the other hops trying to shine through. Still a great brew overall.

Nelson is medium-bodied, and the citrus flavor carries over into the taste of the beer as well, but isnt overbearing at all; its more subtle and complemented by a slight grassy flavor (from the rye?) and a lovely, perfectly subdued bitterness from the hops.

Whereas Duet was a nearly perfect version of what I look for in an IPA, Nelson is unexpected but also world class.  This isnt my first encounter with Nelson Sauvin hops, but its definitely the best use of them that Ive tried.  The beer smells of orange rinds, wild lilacs, honeysuckle and sweet white grape juice.  The flavor is dry, bitter and spicy with rye.  The whole package works extremely well.  I have no real qualms with this beer, but I wouldnt mind if the rye was a bit stronger.  Id love to try an imperial version of this beer, so get on that Alpine.  The mouthfeel has a nice hop oiliness surrounding the duel between hop bite and rye spice.  Its an incredibly drinkable beer despite its unusual flavor profile.

Big expressive tropical fruit aroma, grapefruit, passionfruit, hop resins. Very very drinkable. Far from heavy, quite dry, and a lot of the non-bitter hop qualities come through. Signature powdery/perfumy impression of Nelson Sauvin. This dry perfumy character actually reminds me of Orval, of all things. This is up there with the best IPAs and double IPAs Ive tried.

The lightness is actually enticing considering the darker hues of so many awful, oversweet crystal malt bomb IPAs. Aroma is just ridiculous. A huge wave of tropical fruits explodes from the glass. Peach syrup, tangerines, passionfruit, grapefruit, pineapple; I really cant stop smelling this. The taste is, thankfully, pretty much identical to the aroma, so much so that it was hard to tell when I had stopped inhaling and started imbibing. Fruit salad with a great resinous medium bitterness. Oh and I was so fixated on the fruitiness that I almost didnt notice the rye, which works to spice up (pun intended) the malt base, which would otherwise be imperceivable.

Pours a clear light golden amber with a big fluffy white head that hangs on for quite a while and leaves decent lacing.

The aroma is wonderful, with massive pithy grapefruit, floral pine and grass up front.  The rye spiciness is evident as well and it really makes this more original than most in the nose.

The taste seems to be a little less citrusy than the aroma.  There is some grapefruit up front, but the sweet malts in the backbone are much more evident than in the aroma and finish is very spicy with the rye and bitter with pine resin and pineapple.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated, but the rye makes it smoother than most IPAs and I think it adds to the feel overall.

3862,"2009-08-04",4.0,"Some of the best beers come direct from the brewery or brew pub, in this case Alpine Brewery and I am about to sup on Nelson, an IPA so fresh that he may have brought the hop fields with him. He poured a clear crystalline yellow with a small head and an aroma so big that I am transported to fields of blooming hops and green grass. Fresh has a new poster child. Pine needles, spruce trees, green grass wet with dew, and a bit of a bite at the back of my nose. Permeating his nose is an overwhelming sense of freshness and I am certainly not complaining. Lips wet with anticipation, my first quaff is clean, crisp, and bursting with vibrancy. Grass and pine needles tingle and prickle the top of my tongue before fading into a lingering crisp presence. Dew drops and green grass mingle with lemon in the middle of a light body which has a decent presence of effervescence. Wow. Fresh, clean, invigorating, and oh so hop-erific. Seeing as there was plenty in the growler to go around, I went for another small helping of Nelson before we had to part ways for good.


I finally get it. There is no IPA quite like a fresh IPA. Bottling abilities and technology is at an unprecedented level of quality and high standards, but it will never beat the real deal fresh from its source un-pasteurized and ready for immediate consumption.

3862,"2008-12-29",3.6,"On tap at Obriens.  Clear gold in color with a thin to small off white head.  Clear.  Aroma was strong and pungent.  Citrus, orange, flowers, with hints of caramel, honey and BO.  Flavor was stinky as others have mentioned, as there was a good amount of BO like flavor.  Also a solid amount of citrus, grass and herbs.  Some fruit, but not much balance in this one.  Also, I am not too big of a fan of this hop varietal.","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"

3862,"2008-12-12",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2011 Re-rate: 650 ml bottle from Bev4less. Pours a cloudy yellow color with a fine white head that has good retention and some lacing. The aroma is strong with grapefruit and green hops. The flavor is overtly fruity with mixed citrus, rye and a good biter hop bite. There is also a chlorophyll fresh hop note in the flavor. The mouthfeel is silky smooth. The finish is long with lingering nelson hops.Overall: A solid IPA but different than I remember the draft version.

Smell: I must admit, I enjoyed the aroma far more than I have enjoyed anything else that is, or has ever been, placed in front of my nose. Very aromatic aroma of juicy oranges and pinapples, freshly cut grass, and what reminds me of either minced garlic or shallots. 

Taste: Light, fleeting malt flavor and sweetness upfront before a bright burst of juicy hop flavors, zesty orange rind and pineapple rings. Full notes of white grapes and garlic (or is it shallots). Hint of damp grass. All in all, theres only a very reasonable amount of bitterness. Finishes decidedly crisp.

Unique aroma with an abundance both of interesting and off-putting moments; mango, white grape, salt, and leafy green spices are enveloped with time, plainly, into garlic toast.  Strange.  Flavor is similarly pungent and lightly spicy.  Basil leaves, crackers, old orange juice, and sweet whole garlic clove, mingled with restrained bitterness toward the finish.  Medium bodied, with lively carbonation.  Clean finish with lightly fruity and earthy tones.

3862,"2007-10-09",3.9,"I have been waiting to sample a beer made with Nelson Savin since they first hit the market.  Thanks to cbkschubert, I finally have the opportunity.  Lightly hazy, it even has some floaties from the growler, the beer is a light, copper color and it is topped by a ring of wispy, light tan colored froth.  The aroma is quite distinct, certainly hoppy, but not as I have ever smelled before.  It is quite herbal, with a note reminiscent of garlic chives, some musky hemp notes, and an almost woody grass-like note that can be quite pronounced at times.  There is a fruitiness from the hops too, and with all of the herbal focus, it is not too far of a stretch to say this is like Sauvignon Blanc.  It even has a touch of cattiness to it as well as notes of unripe grapes, lime and even some grapefruit if you really dig for it.

Very weird flavors here; certainly quite distinct in its hop character.  The hops contribute a definite catty note to the flavor that almost leans towards cat litter (though not nearly as bad as that sounds).  Strongly herbal hop notes contribute flavors of pine tar, woody-rosemary, oil-laden hemp seed notes, basil and something that is quite, distinctly, reminiscent of a herbaceous flavor that I just cant quite put my finger on, but is so apparent that I cant figure out why I cant put a name to it.  The beer is fairly light on the palate, and definitely is perceived as being quite dry.  While the herbal notes seem to dominate, there are significant fruit-like flavors contributed by the hops as well; flavors of slightly acidic, under-ripe, green grapes, kefir lime leaf, star-fruit, and a tart citrus character mix in, and somewhat mitigate the herbal notes.  As to the malt notes, well this is definitely an IPA, and they only play a supporting role here; just barely noticeable under all of the hop influence.  The bitterness is not over the top here; it is at a nice, contributing level though and helps to clean up the finish.

This is certainly a fascinating hop, it is quite different from any other hop variety that I have direct experience with.  Very interesting, and very tasty, I definitely could do with more of this beer.  I have a feeling though that these flavors would get old if I encountered them at such levels on a more regular basis.  The hop character (both the aroma & flavor) is so musky; it is makes me think of the essential oils of a mix of herbs.  I am not sure if it quite works in the IPA format, but could definitely see using it in some of the lighter colored Belgian-styled beers.  Definitely well worth it though, and I am still quite exited to use this hop in my own brewing.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
3862,"2007-04-28",4.5,"On cask at OBriens. I went specifically for this brew, waited 10 minutes for the busy bar keeps to put it on. Thats ok, worth the wait. Very hazy yellowish amber with lots of floaties. I wasnt sure if this is typical of a cask pour, or was it because it was the first pour. Didnt matter as it didnt affect the taste. Wow, grapefruit, citrus, pine, a little grass, but nothing overpowering. Very drinkable. Deffinetly surprising, considering some other brews like Exponential, and Pure Hoppiness are put out by this brewery. I really think Alpine is on to something with these Nelson Sauvin Hops.

If not for the 1/2 inch white head, I would have thought it was a practical joke.  Even if it was Bartzillas piss, his piss is one of the best IPAs around.  The aroma is somewhat weak; having grapefruit, yeast, malt, and a touch of pine.  Flavor, very citrusy with hints of pine.  The finish is tart and crisp.  I did think that overall there was a watery taste and feel, as if it could be stronger.  Maybe it was the relatively low alcohol content; Im not sure.
