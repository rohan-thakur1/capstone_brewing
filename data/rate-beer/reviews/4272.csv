4272,"2015-10-29",3.1,"Bottle, in Sacramento. Golden colour, white head. Fairly crisp and fresh aroma and flavour, with subtle hops. Refreshing. South German helles is a low key and discrete beer style, and the brewery in Nevada City has not fallen for the temptation to change that. Nice one.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"
4272,"2015-03-18",4.2,"22 ounce bottle purchased at Pangaea. The aroma on this has nice cracker and light cereal. A little grassy hop is also there along with some spiciness (white pepper). Glistening transparent, beautiful golden-blonde body with a medium, strong, egg-shell head. Starts with a moderately sweet honey-nut-cereal maltiness. This is balanced by some crisp, herbal and grassy moderate hop flavor later on. Mild to moderately bitter. Well-balanced, and very drinkable. Great beer.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
4272,"2015-01-26",3.7,"22 oz. bottle from Cork & Bottle in Fremont. It pours a deep golden color with a very nice off white head. The aroma is nicely balanced between sweet gains, light honey and floral/herbal hops. The flavor is very authentic with strong German malt flavor, Vienna and maybe a touch of Munich with a decent amount of floral/herbal hops in the finish. Its definitely on the sweet/malty side, but it seems pretty close to style. Extremely clean and drinkable. Ill have to keep my eye on these guys if they can continue making lagers this good.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
