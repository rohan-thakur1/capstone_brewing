994,"2017-05-24",3.8,"12oz bottle. Ive had this a few times since the release but this particular bottle is dated 12/29/16, so just about 6 months old. This is actually my favorite version of it, the hops are a bit more mellow. Now, there is a smorgasbord of hops in here and it basically comes off as lightly herbal, lightly green hops. Moderate-low hoppiness and missing any acridness or offputting bitterness. A light, almost pilsner-like beer. Very light and straw colored with a lightly sticky head. Nice little beer.

994,"2016-09-29",3.9,"Draught at Return of the Belgian Beer Fest, 9/17/16.Lightly hazy, blonde-golden body is topped by a large, white head with good retention.Citrus, pepper, coriander and lots of floral character comprise the nose, with the hops showing off little/no resin and a good mix of tangerine, lemon peel and moderately juicy orange. It works well with the grainy, yet substantial malts in the background, with light biscuity notes from the oats as well as a good dose of honey from the maris otter. Well balanced, bright and very floral, overall, with hints of spice from the coriander weaved in nicely and fairly indistinguishable as an adjunct rather than just another yeast biproduct. No alcohol or flaw.Snappy, crisp, pleasingly grainy and with a healthy, but not overdone bitterness, the beer is dry, tightly carbonated and still provides a soft enough texture thanks to the oats and English malt. Honey, vanilla, white and black pepper all add complexity to the citric hop notes and moderate juiciness that is the main show here. No alcohol or flaw, little/no resin on the finish. Great beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
