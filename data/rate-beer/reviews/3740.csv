Drinking this in Costa Rica must take you a step closer to paradise but even in the Cambridgeshire fen it kicks some butt, or rather cask.  Orange-red, clear and clean, with an understated hop but barley-rich and highly drinkable.  Craft beer knocks off its 55th country.","Bristol, Gloucestershire, ENGLAND","Tim Webb"

Sabor amargo, a cerveza artesanal con una espuma que merece producirla en cada sorbo con una ligera movida direccional del vaso.

3740,"2011-01-13",3.3,"The Time Out Tavern in Escazú appears to be selling the hell out of this stuff. I was told by the owner that people are just looking for something different, i.e. in a color other than yellow, and that he could sell the heck out of a porter or stout if they made one. Does that mean the future is dark or bright or both? The Segua is physically attractive, with a mildly hoppy nose that was not quite as big as I wanted it to be. But it rarely is. The flavor is fairly balanced with a light malt sweetness before rolling into a no-nonsense hop-bitterness that lingers with a bit of resin on the tongue. Dry finish asks for another sip. Its a little abrasive, actually, and maybe thats just what these folks need.","Berlin, GERMANY","JoeinDahlem"
