2608,"2015-07-15",4.0,"Awesome head typical of a well made weiss. Cloudy orange-amber color. Leaves a touch of lace on the glass. 

This has a very clean smell. There are some notes of lemon and orange zest as well as all spice and nutmeg. The wheat aroma predominates throughout. 

Strong orange flavors appear in the wheat taste. There are anise like touches while hold the liquid in the mouth. Not as sour as some wheats. And I would describe the flavor as slightly muted compared to other ""louder"" weiss beers. This is a full bodied beer with a high level of carbonation. 

All in all a very clean and refreshing wheat beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","smcolw"

2608,"2012-07-19",3.4,"500 ml bottle. Paid 6.60 U. S for a six pack. The mug showed thick, full, lasting head on top of a Hazy, golden color. Very nice Presentation. 
Nose and taste is traditional to the style. The taste is well above average for a Kristall. Decent wheat yeast, banana and a mild clove note. A bit more malt then I was expecting for such a light style. The body feels heavier then it really is. Drinks really well for me. Finish is short and clean. Damn nice flavors for a bottle. This is fresh with question.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
2608,"2011-08-27",4.1,"Comes out of the tap a hazy honey golden with a fine-bubbled eggshell head that leaves some good lacing. Wheaty, yeasty aroma has a strong citrus overtone and is quite inviting. Wheaty flavor has a strong lemony note, more sweet than sour, and a yeasty underpinning. Overall it is quite refreshing, perfect for a sweltering summer day. Fizzy texture has average body and leaves a wheaty and fairly tingly finish. Prosit!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"

Not as cloudy as one would except from this style of beer, and leaves a taste of bitterness at the finish.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","nike"

Strating with a light body it goes down easy with a clean feel.  Finish is like a light hefey, with a mild malt flavor and a sweet fruity end.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","RSRIZZO"
2608,"2007-02-15",3.9,"Pours a crystal-clear golden color with a nice foamy head that stuck around tll mid-glass. The nose was on the sweet side, with sweet banana being dominant and some light spicy notes. The flavor starts with sweet banana and the same spiciness from the aroma. There is a citric presence and a hint of butteriness too. The end was slightly lighter and sweeter and less dry. The finish was clean with some lingering fruit notes and finishes with little alcoholic warmth. The feel is crisp and moderately carbonated. Kristallklar Weizens are generally served with a lemon. This one tastes great either way. A fine beer, highly drinkable.","farmington, Utah, USA","mikey"

2608,"2004-10-14",3.4,"Clear golden color, and a bodacious, blooming, beautiful white head. Nose is redolent of vanilla, bananas, and a touch of citrus. Extraordinarily smooth and mild, so much that I doubted that I was downing an ale. Full of the flavor of a weizen, but lacking some of the texture.I normally like my weizens with the hefe, but you cant argue with a refreshing kristall such as this.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
2608,"2004-10-10",3.8,"The DM & Hotstuffs European Honeymoon trip beer number 60. This draft brew from our hotel in Garmisch-Partenkirchen Germany poured a medium sized head of foamy finely sized off-white colored long lasting bubbles that left behind a carbonated cloudy orange colored body with some floating yeast.  The aroma was a nice malt yeast typical weizen one and the mouth feel was initially smooth thick malty with a mild tingle that faded in the  finish.  The flavor contained notes of good malt and yeast with no bite.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
2608,"2004-09-14",3.5,"I havent had many kristalweizens...but I can say that I prefer the regular hefeweizens over them.  Im not saying this beer isnt good, I think its actually really good.  Im just not a fan of the  ""sparklier"" weizens.  Still worth a try (or two)","Nutley, New Jersey, USA","Jine"
2608,"2004-05-30",3.2,"Pours a golden blond with an ENORMOUS foamy white head. It just seems to last forever, as well. Aroma is wheaty and yeasty, but a little lacking in the banana and spice department. Theres something there but its rather faint. Perhaps it will come forth as it warms some more. The taste reveals some fruit notes along with the grains and yeast. Moderately full mouthfeel with a sweetened finish. Nice beer but I like regular hefes more.","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
2608,"2004-04-27",3.5,"Like a hefe ""lite"", but still a nice flavorful beer that is very crisp and refreshing. Has all the normal hefeweizen flavors, but seems a little bit sweeter and less dry. Obviously, this one pours a crystal-clear golden color in contrast to the cloudy gold that a normal hefe has.","Brick, New Jersey, USA","beastdog75"
2608,"2004-04-04",3.4,"Well, despite the bottle date of 11/01, this beer wasn't bad.  Poured a clear gold color with a large white head.  The taste was similar to most wheat beers and I have to say a fresh sample will have to be tried to compare to this beer.","Pennsylvania, USA","Prostman"
2608,"2004-03-16",3.3,"First, I am surprised at how few people have rated this. It looks like a typical macro, however, the flavor has much more to offer. The aroma has mellon and that typical bubblegum hefe smell. The flavor is fairly full with a little apple, cantalope and some bread. The finish is smooth , just like the whole beer. Full mouthfeel for the appearance. Nice!","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
2608,"2004-02-29",4.4,"Crystal clear and golden, pouring with 95% airy head, just like back in Germany.  The yeast is omnipresent in the aroma.  The flavor is also yeasty, but also citric and tart.  Quite good, but for true weizen lovers.","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"
2608,"2003-12-23",5.0,"In my mind Hacker Pschorr can do no wrong. The best German beer by a long shot comes from this company and this is amung their best. Kristall has taken a bad rap for being a light beer but heavy does not always mean good. Light certainly does not have to be bad when it is this refreshing. It has all of the food like flavor of Wheat beer that makes it so good in general and no aftertaste. Flavorfull and refreshing. Great but sadly hard to get.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","mikeben"

A little too light.  Not much wheat and yeast flavor that you would expect from a wheat beer (even a filtered one).  Finish is dry and a little tart which is nice.  A decent beer but bordering on a light beer.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"

2608,"2003-06-16",3.0,"Take their regular Weiss and filter out most of the flavor and thats what you have here-a light-weiss beer.  definately a beer you can drink alot of because it is very non-filling.  I will stick to the weiss and the dark weiss.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
2608,"2003-05-30",3.1,"Lots of bubbles, and yes, this beer is definitely filtered and very ""kristal.""  I really don't know why you would do this to a German wheat though.  Looks and tastes almost like a pils.  Lots of metallic qualities, with an astringent bite from so much CO2 and so little flavor.  Nice head though.  Mild clove/banana notes.  Not anything terrible.","Washington DC, USA","jskendzel"
2608,"2003-05-07",3.1,"Golden color with a off white head.  Really look more like a lager. Light wheat and mild yeast aroma. Light wheat flavors with a touch of acidity and higher bitterness.

2608,"2003-02-06",3.7,"A lighter cousin of the Weisse - but quite refreshing. Aroma of bubble gum and bananas.  Nice fluffy white head that dissipates quickly.  Slight aftertaste that is not uunpleasant but takes a bit away from the experience - kind of a dry taste as it goes down.  Appaearance is not cloudy as most other wheats - by design, obviously (kristall = clear).","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"

2608,"2002-07-16",3.3,"A rock-solid kristallweisse. Dignified label and bottle, with good-looking brassy beer. Tall white head which fades to lace in a hurry. The aroma is yeasty, musky and parched. A dry pepper and starchy banana flavor (plaintain?) with a quick finish that contains a little backend tin and tartness. The tartness builds a little, so plan on a slaw dog or two to go with it.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"
2608,"2002-07-02",3.8,"Rich clove and citrus aroma.  Clear and bright gold with large foamy head.  Clean maltiness (?) - very light hopping.  Soft body.  Metallic off-taste fades near the end of the glass.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
2608,"2002-07-01",3.4,"Quite malty aroma, wheat of course.  This beer actually fizzed when I poured it in the glass, I cant remember the last time that happened!  The head is initially impressive but fades quickly.  Bright, shiny gold color.  Some nice malt flavors here, a little spicy banana, and some bitterness.  Spritzy and clean finish, effervescent.  Yeasty aftertaste.  If you like filtered German Wheats, odds are this will be right up your alley, especially in warm weather (such as now).","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
2608,"2002-06-16",4.2,"Another sensational wheat thats almost as delicious as the Hacker Weisse!  Very very good stuff thats heavy on the wheat aroma and flavor, though I always favor the cloudy hefes because they seem more authentic to me.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
