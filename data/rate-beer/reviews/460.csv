 Kolor:  Czarny, całkowicie nieprzejrzysty. 
 Piana:  Gruba, puszysta złożona z drobnych i średnich beżowych oczek.
Po kilku minutach pęka do dużych oczek. Gruba oponka dryfuje po powierzchni. Każdy wypity łyk odciska się kolejną wstęga na szkle.
Piana pięknie zdobi każdy milimetr firmowego kielicha.
Po wypiciu całego piwa piana wciąż pozostaje w szkle! 
 Zapach:  Umiarkowanie trwały aromat kawy. Solidna słodowa baza, odrobina zboża i lekka paloność.
W tle nuty gorzkiej czekolady.
Aromat średnio intensywny, ale przyznaje, że piwo jest jeszcze za zimne, aby w pełni się otworzyć. 
 Smak:  Jeśli mamy tutaj do czynienia ze Stoutem to z całą pewnością jest to American Stout. 
Pojawiają się tutaj wyraźne przesłanki wskazujące na obecność amerykańskiego chmielu.
Jest intensywa żywiczna, leśna strona, jest tez odrobina cytrusów w tle.
Kawa jest obecna, ale jest delikatna i nie przytłacza piwa bazowego.
Mamy za to konkretnie zbudowaną słodową bazę w której głównymi elementami jest wypieczony chleb, lekki karmel, odrobine orzechów, ciasto typu keks (ciasto biszkoptowe z bakaliami).
Czekolada jest kolejnym nieodłącznym fragmentem trunku. Nie za mocna, gorzka, taka w sam raz.
Laktoza dodana do Stouta nadała mu wyraźnego kremowego odczucia w ustach.
Masywna tekstura i niesamowita gładkość i lekkość spożycia.
Wow! Klasa! 
 Wysycenie:   

Pokazowy Stout, taki jaki można uznać za wzór stylu. Nie przegięty w żadną stronę.
Doskonale wyważony. Nie za słodki, niezbyt wytrawny, dokładnie w sam raz.
Kawa, która stonowiła główny dodatek nie była przytłaczająca, nie dominowała bazy i nie zasłaniała całej reszty składowych.
Piwo znika ze szkła w kilku łykach, a to stanowi o jego największej sile.

Restrained sweetishness in the onset, some dried fig, surrounded by dried meat-like umami and an underlying basic roasted barley sourishness which accompanies the rest of the palate, going through a nutty and roasted malt bitter middle with sweetish chocolatey and caramelly notes, ending in mouth-filling coffeeish roastedness further (and refinedly) accentuated by the actual coffee bean aroma retronasally, sharpened by a peppery hop bitterness. Nice, rounded and clean, of the standard quality I expect from Mikkeller.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

460,"2016-08-04",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2017 
Aroma:

Medium/heavy aroma of malts, caramel, chocolate, mocha, roasted malts, coffee and hops.

Appearance:

Opaque black beer with a medium dark brown head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium/heavy sweet with malts, caramel, chocolate and mocha; ends slightly bitter and dry with roasted malts, coffee and hops.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. Great idea to create a rather low abv stout with added lactose and coffee. The aroma consists mostly of roasted malts, coffee and hops; but thankfully the flavour also has a nice amount of sweet flavours. This is Mikkeller at its best.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"
