1577,"2014-08-31",3.6,"Sampled at Osake, pours a cloudy white. Aroma brings out honey melon, glutinous rice and medium sweetness. Flavour brings out notes of melon, a tinge of coconut, and light honey sweetness. Well-constructed and likely the most interesting of the four I tried.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1577,"2014-08-30",3.6,"Bottle @ Artisan Sake. Milky white pour. Sort of whey-like. Aromas of pear, rice, and melon. Rather fruity and a touch spicy. Flavor has a lot of sweet rice and sugar. Some pear and baked apple. A hint of melon, black pepper, and alcohol. Kind of on the sweet side. Slight vanilla on the finish.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
1577,"2010-12-23",3.4,"Has a nice foggy body that swirls well, seems like an antique white colour. Aroma is slightly fruity with lemon notes. taste is equally smooth, no alcohol evident either. This was my favourite of their three available as a tasting.","Alberta, CANADA","DeanF"
1577,"2010-07-31",3.7,"Bottle at the breweryMuddy white color (a Nigori is unfiltered). Melon aroma. Chewy mouthfeel; fruity and peppery flavor, with evident final bitterness. Good but less interesting than the other two Junmai brothers.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
1577,"2009-12-10",4.0,"Bottle: Very light sediment on the bottom of the bottle. Roused together it pours a very lightly misty white with a almost no particles clinging to the sides. The nose is fresh with some citrus and rice, a pungent pear and honey note and some light rice and minerals. The impact has a nice acidity and sweetness that balance each other and gives it a sweet lime note in the flavor. The mouthfeel is balanced and chewy with a grape note and more pear and honey notes. Very interesting taste here as the acidity is a lot lower than usual for a sake, so you get a fresh clean impact that pairs well with the umami of the nama and the body of the nigori. Each taste almost cleanses the palate of itself so you want another; very brief tail. Im impressed, and I dont even like nigori!","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1577,"2008-12-31",4.1,"Bottle sent by Oakes that I found at the back of my fridge.  Cloudy creamy pale milky colour.  Aroma is very milky and sweet with a light tapioca character and a nice sweet vanilla flavour.  Lychee, pear and honeydew melon.  Really smooth, rich and lightly doughy with very little bit for something this strength.  Lovely sake with a very soft fruitiness.  Quite clean with a soft lingering mix of flowers and fruit.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

1577,"2007-01-20",4.0,"Pearl-like opaque white.  Wonderfully fragrant - floral, light fruit, sugar, koji.  Sweetish character, wonderful clean rice notes, drying out a bit in the finish with alcohol.  Not as complex as the Nama but I really like this one.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
