275,"2016-11-21",2.0,"Went into this with no expectations. Bright and fizzy. Sweet and easy to drink. Not much aroma to speak of but it was refreshing. I probably would not buy it again, but I am not upset that I spent money for it.","Nebraska, USA","ghostbeer"
275,"2016-06-04",2.0,"Pours clear with a hint of yellow. Aroma is of yeast, wine, some booze, and something sour. Like sour crab apples. Bubbly palate. Flavor is of yeast, grapes, aluminum, leaves, and apples. Leaves a sour yeasty apple finish.","Fall River, Massachusetts, USA","halfonit"

275,"2015-08-30",2.2,"30.08.2015, 0,25l bottle (as Gekkeikan Sparkling Sake (golden label) @ 7,5% ABV) @ home:
Small fizzy shortlasting head, lightl straw colored. Aroma is mild rice aroma, with some yeast, hay and citrus. Taste is slightly dry and kind of fresh, paper, minerals, grass, citrus, rice, yeast. Watery and fizzy muthfeel. Meh!","Loddefjord, NORWAY","Inbreak"

275,"2014-08-24",2.3,"250 ml pull-tap bottle as Gekkeikan Sparkling Saké (golden label) bought at Tandron Spirits Internationals booth at HKCEC in Wan Chai during HKTDC Food Expo 2014.
Clear, very pale greenish-yellow colour; Less than one-quarter finger head with residual soapy white foams which fades in 10 seconds; Very small sticky lacing with fizzy carbonation; Fragrant and very sweet aroma of glutinous rice wine, with pear flesh, liquored apricots, sugar syrup, soda and light alcohol; Close to light sweet taste of light rice wine, with warming alcohol, fairly light dried apricots, carbo, spice and light tannin-like bitterness; Light body. Dry and watery palate; Mouth feel is like a herbal rice wine: dry, spicy with woody and tannin feel. Fairly low sweetness comparing to its very sugary aromas. Initial warming alcohol give ways to low-fi dried apricots. Not a lots of sake rice characters. Weird Dry after taste; Spicy and easy to mouth.

Comments: This is a lot better than the pure-pop and sweet Mio Sparkling Sake by Takara, but its not helped by the weird mix of Yomeishu-like herbs and spice taste, warming alcohol with low sweetness not enough to balance it. It gives you the feeling of being properly made, but its fake sugary aroma and dull taste suggests substantial improvement is long overdue. Until then, dont bother.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"
275,"2014-07-10",3.1,"lekki, przyjemny zapach ryżu. dość słodki. porównywalny do innych sake w tym stylu, ale mniej alkoholowy i agresywny. kolor lekko posłodzonej wody. w smaku dość słodkie, owocowe, z bardzo niewielką goryczką z alkoholu. dość niskie nasycenie i lekki smak sprawia, że pije się bardzo łatwo","POLAND","czlowiekwiadro"
275,"2014-07-02",2.7,"Pours like some rain water (yellow-tinted) with a small fizzy head that disappears almost instantaneously. Nose is that of a flavored water, lightly sweet and fruity (must be the rice). Taste is sweet and pretty challenging to describe for someone who doesnt know sake, Id say diluted soda (cream soda) but it must be some rice water. Carbonation is moderate and nice, body light to medium. Overall this is a refreshing but pretty simple drink. Sweet sake might not be my thing.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
275,"2013-10-28",3.6,"Once again, I hope that I am rating the correct sake, virtually all of the label is in Japanese. Only thing stated on the label in English is Sparkling Sake. I do think that I have found the correct one. 25 cl. bottle @ home. Purchased from Sun Wah in Antwerp. Black plastic hand grenade / soft drink pin. Nice design on cap. Extremely pale golden, white head fizzes away immediately. Basically extremely pale golden with zero head. Nose is sweet overly boozy especially for the ABV, raw floral sake yeast, white sugar, touch fake sweet, almost inkling of corn, Sparkling, lemonade-sweet, touch citrus, some floral sake yeast, boozy (seriously the ABV is 7.5 %), flowery, warming, sweetish, flowers, lots of cheap sake yeast, yeast seems the same as the other Gekkeikan sakes, plenty of soda lemon, Sparkling like soda. I have had only one un-pasteurized & carbonated sake before this one but it wasnt soda-like this one. Sweet lemonade & soda-like this one, nothing objectionable but feels very tampered with & artificial. This is more lemonade than anything else but it is pretty good lemonade. Lots of fun but way too expensive for a fun lemonade. Really way too much.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
275,"2013-10-06",2.3,"Bottle shared at Andys with Andy, Pearl, Max, Blipp and Ramy. Pours a clear body with light carbonation. Aroma is sweet rice, melon and metal. Mouthfeel is carbonated and sweet with notes of apples, alcohol, a fizzy sweet effervescence, rice and light fruit flavors.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
275,"2013-08-30",2.0,"Bottle. Pours clear. Aroma is very sweet, rice, melon, apples, alcohol, not very pleasant. Taste follows suit, pretty gross. Very lightly carbonated. I dont know anything about sake, but I can tell this is a bad sake.","Seattle, Washington, USA","RamyG4"
275,"2013-08-28",2.6,"Bottle. Pours nearly clear and sparkling. Sweet melon, refrigerated rice, and an odd seltzer-like mouthfeel. Not awful.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
275,"2013-08-27",2.0,"Pours like seltzer water. Aroma of sweet melon and a little acetone. Alcohol as well. Taste is watered down and seltzery. Gross, bro. As it warms, the aroma becomes stinky. Not good. Some sweetness in there. Not even all that spritzy on the palate. Finishes sweet. Worst sake Ive had.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"
275,"2013-08-27",1.9,"Sweet bottle. Makes me feel zippy and young again. Light, ricey aroma, very unexciting stuff. Mild melon. Really shitty flavor. Rubber band, pineapple. Terrible sake.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
275,"2013-07-11",3.0,"25cl bottle - pours just off clear with very quickly diminishing white head. Nose is ricy booze. Reminds me of weak moonshine with a sweet finish. I must say I like the sparkling element in sake for it also reminds me of something: champagne. Is this the wine cooler of the sakes? I like this a lot thought it lacks flavor and taste.","Taylor Mill, Kentucky, USA","Chudwick"
275,"2013-06-05",3.0,"Bottle: Poured a clear sparkling sake which almost resemble Sprite. Aroma consists of light warming alcohol with some grainy notes. Taste is a mix of light grain alcohol with sweet notes. Carbonation is quite strong with large bubbles. I am definitely not an expert on sake but I thought this was mildly enjoyable.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
275,"2013-03-16",3.0,"It pours transparent with a slight yellowish tint; the head is white and violently foamy. The aroma has notes of: apple, alcohol, and rice koji. The taste is medium-light sweet that finishes with a light tartness; there are notes of: fuji apples, rice koji, pepper, and alcohol. The palate is light bodied, heavily carbonated (big bubbles), slightly sticky, and a medium sweet finish. Overall, its not very good , per say - the novelty value is off the charts. Id drink it for free, and enjoy it.","Ontario, CANADA","chris__hartley"
275,"2012-11-15",3.0,"Poured from a 250 ml bottle. Poured a like a light colored champagne with a green hue. The nose is grainy, musty. The carbonation brings any interesting new dimension to sake. The flavor is strong of green apple, dusty/musty. I am not a huge sake fan but I did find this interesting.","Bountiful, Utah, USA","Gription79"
275,"2012-06-29",2.0,"250ml bottle poured into a flute. Pours a clear light yellow with almost no head. Almost reminds me of a light cider. Aroma of rice with some very light citrus and some vinegar. Taste is light sweet. Rice, citrus and something else I just cant put my finger on. Medium bodied with a sticky texture. Fizzy carbonation and a long finish. Overall, not bad. Im not really digging this one so Ill pass it on to the lady.","Rockford, Illinois, USA","jmagnus87"
275,"2012-04-19",2.5,"This stuff pours about as clear as water w/ just a little fizzle of carbonation; it definitely looks less carbonated than water. The nose has some white grape overtones and a musty mushroom earthiness. This has an oily texture and a touch of lemon-like sourness. Its rather mildly flavored w/ very soft carbonation. Even w/ its rather thick texture it is only very slightly sweet. This has a nice nose but overall Id call it interesting more so than good.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
275,"2012-02-15",2.7,"Light aroma. Clear color that fizzes up and quickly goes away. Mild bitter beginning with a light sweet finish. This sake seemed to be lacking.","Waterbury, Connecticut, USA","rocbyter"
275,"2012-01-23",2.6,"THOUGHTS: Different. Not as much flavor as I was expecting. Very light flavor and aroma. Surprised by the alcohol presence in such a low ABV.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured pretty much clear and colorless with only maybe a slight yellow tint and a small , white head that fully diminished and left virtually no lacing. The aroma had white wine, slight alcohol, coconut, pear, and fruit cocktail juice only lighter. The initial flavor was lightly sweet and light to moderately acidic; while the finish was lightly sweet, moderately acidic and slightly bitter with a long duration. There was coconut, alcohol, light-colored fruit, fruit cocktail juice and grapes. The medium body was a bit syrupy and then a little dry with nearly pin-prick, fizzy carbonation and a slightly astringent and slightly alcoholic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"
275,"2012-01-14",2.9,"I love the subtle quiet aroma of rice. Its a beautiful sparkling sake, but the taste is watered down and just okay. I was hoping for something more.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","dreamflower"
275,"2012-01-14",2.9,"Clear (a touch of yellow) with a white head. This is a carbonated sake, which is interesting. Not as flavourful or interesting as some of the better sakes, but refreshing and unique.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","northropfrye"
275,"2011-11-25",3.4,"Bottle.  Pours a soft golden white with a thin white head around the edges.  Light rice on the nose.  Big soda like carbonation, a touch empty, sweetness. More sweetness on the finish, and a touch of lemon., but nothing super big. A nice idea, but lacking a bit in execution.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
275,"2011-11-12",3.4,"Pours with basically no color, the sake has a bit of a head on it when its first poured but that fades away fairly quickly. Some of the tiny bubbles are however retained.

The aroma is spicy and lightly fruity with some light boozeiness, over all the pear seems to be the most dominant and pleasant aroma within this sake. 

The flavor is fairly sweet but not sugary or awful. This sake is very fruity with good berry and pear notes. There are some rice flavors in the sake but the booze character (while noticeable) is really pretty small and easily forgotten with all the other nice things going on in this sake.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
275,"2011-09-02",3.2,"Bottle. First Sake. Color was a pale golden color. Lots of bubbles. Aroma was light fruit and grain. Flavor was also slightly fruity and slightly sweet. I actually enjoyed it.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","tnkw01"
275,"2011-04-10",3.2,"Bottle as shown at Kona. Pours a champagne color and a lot of bubbles. The aroma is faint fruit and rice. Medium mouthfeel with a sweet fruit flavor and crisp finish. Easy to drink a good sake from Gekkeikan.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
275,"2010-12-18",3.0,"Clear with a white head and a lot of bubbles that look like champagne. Fruity aroma. The flavor is rice, as well as a little bit of melon and some citrus notes. Very fizzy carbonation. Could substitute for champagne.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
275,"2010-10-27",1.9,"This might be my first sake of any kind so I have nothing to compare it with.  Pour is as clear as water with very short lived and noisy bubbles.  Feel is almost like water, too.  The aroma and taste is light soft fruit such as melon.  Very light bitterness.  This is like a wine cooler lite.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
275,"2010-07-17",2.2,"Bottle from Whole Foods Market, Charlottesville, VA. Pours an almost colorless crystal clear color with a medium sized fizzy head that faded instantly. Looks much like soda.

275,"2010-03-13",3.0,"Clear body with a very faint yellowish tint.  Nice tart fruity melon, rice cracker aromas. light zesty mouthfeel. Flavors of dry rice cracker slathered with apricot jam. not bad.","Same Trailer, Different Park, Louisiana, USA","AmEricanbrew"

275,"2009-08-31",3.2,"Bottle from LCBO vintages- Clear with a fizzy thin cap of bubbles that fades quickly. Nose is faint, of rice and white wine. Flavours profile is good. White wine and sweet rise, a bit floral/herbal. Clean and refreshing, Nice tingle from the bubbles. I might not buy it again at $9.00, but it was nice to try.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"
275,"2009-08-29",3.7,"Ah the champagne of Sakes.  This bottled sake from the Kampai Japanese Steak House in NY poured a frothy head of clear bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a transparent softly carbonated with a silvery hue to it. The mouth feel was lightly tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor was mildly wine like thin watery with a very mild vinous note. The aroma was almost non-existent.  Delicious and one I would certainly buy again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
275,"2009-06-06",3.1,"First experience with carbonated sake. Pleasant aroma. Reminds me of a lightly fragrant Chenin Blanc. Flavors of dough mixed with a bit of alcohol to it. Not overly sweet, but interestingly sweet. Interestin aftertaste lingering on the palate. Definately see how this would be good with a spicy spider roll.","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"

275,"2009-01-23",3.6,"Pours clear, with subtle aromas of melon and fruit. Flavor is strong melon, fruit, and rice. The carbonation throws you off at first, but it is interesting. Ends oin the dry side. Too bad its $7 for 250ml.","Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA","zathrus13"

Its got a fruity flavor with a touch of rice and a sugary sweetness.  I think they were aiming for a drinkable sake for the non-sake drinker.

275,"2006-10-02",3.3,"Was pretty cheap.  Looks like a sparkling seltzer water.  Lots of residual sugars.  Decent legs.  The sake smells of rice and floral oils.  Lots of rice yeast/fungus too.

275,"2006-04-01",3.3,"250ml bottle, $5.99 at Joes Place in Norman.  Pours almost water clear but with a light yellow hue, bubbling like soda water with big round CO2 bubbles quickly fizzing to the top to create a slightly filmy white head which dies rather quickly.  Initial scent is geen apple peel, similar to what others have said, along with a medicinal milky scent that I find common in sake (very heavy in nigori) but which I cant describe any better.  Clean aroma, if that means anything.

Mouth feel is very strange to me: carbonated like a soda, slightly filmy and creamy, and quickly dissolving across the tongue, fizzing the tongue like Sprite.  Sweet flavors of band-aids, white grapes, pears and green apples give this a nice juicy flavor, overall more sweet than sour, and actually the carbonation, which I presume is more novelty than convention, is something I really enjoy.  Worth a try for the education aspects of sake for someone like me who is still a novice, I guess, but very steep at $6 per bottle.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
275,"2005-11-22",2.8,"Whole Foods, Baton Rouge, La. stylish 250 ml silver labeled bottle. Pours a sparking clear - looks like tonic water - a little different for a sake. No apparent aroma that I pick up. Slight apple flavor is found, with a back end or sour grren apple bubble gum - odd. Very light for a sake.  Mouthfeel is slighlty spritzy and much thinner than most Sakes. Passable.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
