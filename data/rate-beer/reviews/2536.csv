2536,"2013-02-15",3.3,"Draft at Churchkey. Ill preface this review by mentioning that Im giving this beer a bit of a handicap due to the style. Poured a really light, slight haze color to it. Light, touch of fruit notes. Flavor was about the same. Pretty enjoyable here.

2536,"2012-10-01",3.1,"On tap at Copenhagen Beer Celebration 2012. A big, off-white head leaves lacings as the orange-golden, unclear beer escapes the glass. The aroma has some citrus and a little peachy hint, as well as a touch of malty sweetness. The flavor is more on the peachy side, with citrus, and a backdrop of malty sweetness. Should have more bitterness in my opinion, both initially and in the swallow. Medium to thin on the palate, dryish and a bit lot on carbonation.

Belle couleur orangée trouble, col est blanc épais.
Arôme froment, fruité léger, fleuri avec un subtile bouquet houblonné en retrait dans le style noble.
En bouche, reste assez épaisse et légère, bien fruitée avec une pointe presque dans les esters, une fin note damertume simmisce en fin de bouche pour lui donner un corps rond. Pétillant reste faible. En ayant bu la XXXX on y voit la signature avec au final un très beau produit.
