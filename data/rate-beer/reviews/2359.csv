2359,"2017-06-10",3.8,"330 ml bottle bought at HK Brewcraft in Tsim Sha Tsui.
Looks: Clear amber red colour; One finger head with crumpety light beige foam which lasts for 3 minutes; Excellent sticky lacing with quite fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant full Ale malt, with strong caramel, rich toffee, citrus peels, light tangerines, floral, strong molasses, pine, strong resins, spices, earth, biscuit, lemon and grass.

Taste: Close to medium sweet strong Amber malt, with grapefruits, strong caramel, toffee, strong floral, molasses, pine, strong resins, spices, strong herbs, dry biscuits, strong lemon, very strong bitter hops and grass.

Body: Full body; Thick and very oozy palate.

Mouth Feel: Quite rich Amber maltyness in a thick background, smoothness is oat-like. Strong oozy hoppiness dominates throughout, with pine, grapefruits, spices and strong herbs to compliment solid caramel and toffee. Flowery with just right sweetness. Biscuity with strong lemon to round. Very good!

Hoppiness: Citrus peels, light tangerines, floral, pine, strong resins, spices, earth, lemon and grass in nose. Grapefruits, strong floral, pine, strong resins, spices, strong herbs, strong lemon and grass in taste; Bitterness is very strong for a lasting, more than high astringent bitter-sweet herbal malty finish.

After taste: Quite dry. Oozy, spicy and strong bitter to mouth.

Comments: Its Amber maltyness is rich already, with rock solid IPA style resiny citrus hoppiness for a well-balanced tasting sensation. A damn good English-style red IPA!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

2359,"2017-02-26",3.7,"Aroma:

Medium aroma of malts, caramel, orange, bread, hops and citrus.

Appearance:

Turbid/opaque dark orange/dark brown beer with heavy yeast and with a slight/medium beige head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts, caramel and orange; ends slightly bitter and dry with bread, hops and citrus.

Overall:

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. Good beer overall and even more so for its style. Feels like there is a bit too much yeast, because it is slightly too balanced. Both the malts and the hops could have been more bombastic. Thanks to this the aroma could have been stronger and the finish less dominated by bread.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

2359,"2014-11-05",3.1,"In short: A nourishing, sweet and bitter burgundy ale. A bit harsh and heavy. Ok.
How: Bottle 500ml, consumed when probably not fresh enough... (but soon after I got the beer through private importation).
The look: Cloudy ruby-copper body topped by a large beige head with medium retention.
In long: The mostly hoppy nose is very resinous and very piney along with strong toasted notes. In mouth the beer has a thick foamy-yeasty texture with a very active carbonation. Taste is a bit harsh. There is a lot of toasted malts, plenty of caramel, a strong yeast presence, sweet berries jam, earthy old wood, fruits seeds, assertive piney bitterness, sticky resin. This is a tasty beer that is everything but refreshing, it is nourishing, heavy, aggressively bitter, rather sweet. Meh, not my thing, not sure why I bought this, I will now get someone to buy beers for me because Ive finally decided I cannot trust my own judgment, and now Im cannot decide if I can trust my lack of trust of my own judgement, this is the beginning of a long process.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Coniferous angles and earth-covered tree bark move into dried cranberries in this fluffy India Red Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A tower of foam dwindles into the cloudy dark red.
-Carbonation is very high and expansive. Feels like a Belgian-style Ale, without the yeast signature, of course.
-The hops are as aromatic as they are bitter.
-Orange zest confit is tasted at the edges.
-Malts also share some discreet caramel.

The only thing that stops me giving this a higher score is, like one of the commenters before me said, the alcohol content is just a tad too high, but dont let that stop you from drinking this malty, hoppy elixir!
ReRate: Ive just had a very fresh bottle, the difference between this and a slightly older one is quite noticable. Older bottles are what I would consider typical red: they have dark fruit like raisins, alcoholic plums, xmas cake and caramel etc. This fresh one is more towards the typical NZ IPA style, lots of fruit on the nose and a taste that finishes pine.

Malt also has a lot of play in this beer, still the same barley wine-ish notes with caramel, raisins, bread crust. I get a slight tartness in the far end, like lemon zest or something.

Upon tasting there is initially an astringent bitterness with creamy mouthfeel and masses of berryfruit. Im wondering how this is an Indian Red Ale. It is certainy red, but doest have the hops and mature depth youd expect from an IPA. Maybe this is my own inexperience, but I was expecting something chewy and substantial that grabs you and doesnt let go. This seeps away leaving a sweet fruity kiss, but little else.

First off the mark upon tasting is the same caramel and light toasty malt, with a big piney, resinous hoppy hit taking over soon after. Its all finished off by a powerful bitterness. Personally I find the bitter a little overwhelming, it has a sharp, almost metallic character to it.
