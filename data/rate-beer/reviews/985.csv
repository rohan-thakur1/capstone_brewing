In order to clear some space in the cellar I grabbed this still fresh bottle of Redemption and cracked it open on a lazy evening. Proving Russian River is more than just a branding ploy, this Belgian sparkles with qualities that should make it a daily drinker for those lucky enough to live on the West Coast.

Aroma / Appearance - A cloudy base mixes warm caramel with golden yellow. Slow falling white head melts like snowflakes. Light yeast, lemon, and citrus aspects tickle the air with a bright feel.

Flavor / Palate - A full body of sourdough bread, lemon butter, and citrus punch through the palate. A malty core gives smooth depth. A very easy drinking release compares favorably to anything you would run across in the Midwest including the best staples from Jolly Pumpkin. I will have to try future batches the next time I travel west.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

A - Pours cloudy straw yellow with a thin film of white head leaving little to no lacing down the glass.


S - The nose is a tad spicy from all that yeast. The yeast leaves a dry impression that will carry on throughout the glass. A nice light funk provides a bit of earthiness and works well with some citrus fruits to offer some type of contrast to all that yeast.


T - My immediate reaction was to check and make sure I had the right bottle, this thing could easily be from Belgium. Light funk with a touch of zest up front but that flavor is quickly overtaken by a dry, overbearing, yeast presence. Some light spices and a bit of sweetness are an excellent contrast to the strong yeast core. Pretty good for a lighter beer. Glad I tried it.


M - Light body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Refreshing feel from the light funk, drying the pallet quickly. Finish is a bit chewy with some of it lingering long after consumption.

The taste was a boldly yeasty with a mild grainy feel and a light fruity presence early on, and slowly became mildly bitter with a touch of citrus, a hint of banana and a light spicy ending. The flavor had a great longevity, with a nice yeasty taste that was left lingering while you got this slight spicy bite right to the back of the throat.

Mild breadiness comes through, and just a touch of bitterness on the finish. Wonderfully executed. Should I expect less from these guys? Drinkable? All-day-long. Great beer.","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"

3.0 A: Lightly hazed golden wheat color. Just a finger of frothy/foamy white head that fell quickly leaving no lacing.

A - 5-Finger crystal hear head. Exceptional head lacing stuck to the edges of the glass. After 3 minutes, head dissipation is slow with half a finger left. SRM of 2. Bright, light golden color almost akin to lemon juice minus the haze. Very clear beer.

S - Bready Belgian Yeast, loads of spices and some tropical fruits. Very smooth on the nose except for that really awesome spice that smells like Cayenne, Basil and Black pepper.

T - Damnation with spice? Thats what Im getting. Very spicy and that overtakes all of the other flavors. Of course, theres that standard Belgian Abbey Ale taste and some dry fruits like apricot and raisins. Its very light on the yeast but its there.

985,"2012-04-12",3.9,"Received a 12.68 FL. OZ. (375 ML) bottle of this in a trade w/ HoppySuds.  Poured from the Cork/Wire Capped bottle w/ a Blue Label and a 3 pronged pitch fork into a 12oz SweetWater ""15"" Tulip Glass. Has Batch 010 on the back of the bottle. Since this is a beer Im enjoying throughout the Blues vs. Sharks (Game 1) of the playoffs, I thought this blue labeled bottle would be very fitting. Go Blues! 

Aroma- Has tons of fruit and banana character from the beginning. Light spices are in the background.  Medium-High maltiness in the background. 

Appearance- Pours a 1 finger head that has average retention. Has a copper, hazy body that has a blonde glow to it.  Leaves a few suds behind. 

Flavor- Very sweet fruits and malt from the start. Has very soft characters and finishes with spices.  Light Bitterness at the finish.  

Mouthfeel- Light-Medium Bodied, Medium-High Carbonation, Effervescent, and prickles with malt on the palate. 

Overall Impression- A very nice brew from Russian River but not my favorite from them.  Just good all along the ranks.  I would definitely grab a sour from them before enjoying this one again.  Very close to style. Thumbs up brew.","Ballwin, Missouri, USA","DConMan"

985,"2011-04-05",3.5,"If youre familiar with Belgian beer youve probably heard of the styles dubbel, tripel and quad, but have you ever heard of a Belgian single? Yes, such a style exists but is rarely brewed outside the walls of a Trappist monastery intended for the monks personal consumption (better known as a ""paters bier""). Ive reviewed three of these rare beers, so I was very eager to try Russian River Redemption - an American attempt at this niche Belgian style. I must say they got the style down pat! Not that its the worlds best beer or anything, just a good one.I poured a 12oz corked bottle into a Trappist chalice.Appearance: Bright yellow, mostly clear until the yeast slips in then become hazy. Massive carbonation present. Not much head, though - just a thin coating of white soapy suds. No lacing.Smell: Mild aromatics of green fruits (especially white grape) and peppery yeast esters. Taste: Upon my first sip of Redemption I was amazed by how well an American brewery has emulated an authentic Belgian Trappist style. Immediately I feel an intense tingling of spices and carbonation dancing on my tongue. The palate is light, but spicy on both halves - grassy hop spiciness across the front, and dry black pepper on the rear. Theres a noticeable tobacco-like flavor as well not commonly found in beers of this range. It could be clove or clove-like flavors from the yeast (commonly found in German hefeweizens), but Im not sure if that or any other spice is used in the brewing of this beer.Drinkability: I always find Belgian ""singles"" of this sort to be a liquid paradox. Theyre light-bodied to be sure, but their palates contain the energy levels of much strong beers. Redemption is quite spicy in the mouth and combined with its extremely effervescent body - its not a beer that can be slugged down easily. Even though it finishes clean, I wouldnt call it refreshing since its so lively in the mouth. The 5.15% ABV seems right, as this beer definitely has more weight to it than the lighter Trappist blondes that inspired it.Overall, an impressive beer for reasons (especially considering its only a 12oz bottle and its caged and corked). Not absolutely delicious, but tasty and satisfying.NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM32HG7nsOI","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

985,"2011-03-28",4.0,"Poured from a 375ml bottle at Fresh Craft into a snifter.

A: Pours a hazy golden straw appearance. Head is present but fades rather fast, not a lot of action or stability but the lacing is very pretty.

S: Musky and yeasty right off the bat. Hints of spice linger on through the aroma with wild funk backing it up. A hint of earthiness and apples rise and fall through the nose.

T: Very delicate beer. Incredibly balanced between the yeast spice notes with caramelized malts. While not cloying the sugar is present but not the main flavor going on. Pears and apples dominate the fruit but only backup the spice and yeast. Hops are low and malt is high, lemon grass, terroir, earth, and musk are the main flavors. Finishes clean and refreshing. Moderate linger.

M: Moderate but not heavy in weight on the palate. Cotes the palate very evenly and lightly. The carbonation is fantastic and balances the richness of this beer.

D: Lovely beer! Sipping this reminds me of what the monks would drink while eating their bread. Very balanced, soft, and delicate with great earthy musty notes balanced with spice and yeast and rounded out with pears and soft green apples.","centennial, Colorado, USA","noturdadsbeer"

985,"2011-03-08",3.7,"Batch 009.  The beer pours a very hazy, gold color with a full, white, fluffy head which settles to a thin pillowy layer and leaves scattered, Belgian lace.  The nose is pleasant with fresh herbal notes (bay leaves, sage), subtle light candi sugar, soft sweet breads, and a light coriander.  The flavor is similar with similar herbal notes, more leafy and woodsy notes emerging, coriander, and very faint bread tones.  The palate is very soft and silky feeling, soft to lively, and light to medium in body.  The beer finishes drying with a moderate bitterness, still very leafy, and almost a lemon peel tinge.  Interesting take on the Belgian single with just what I was expecting in the nose but something different in the flavor.  Much more bitter and dry than I thought it would be, but I guess that is why RR says this beer is ""styled"" after a Belgian single and not a copy of one.  The palate was perfect for the beer allowing the subtleties to emerge.  Nice table strength Belgian from RR.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

985,"2011-02-06",3.9,"Batch 008.  Enjoyed from a 13oz bottle in a chalice.  The beer pours a moderately hazy straw-colored yellow, with a moderate white head.  The nose shows characters of very light lemon, the Chimay yeast strains characteristic ester profile, and a very slight note of tartness.  Malt or hops do not seem to come through in any meaningful manner.  The flavor profile is truly illustrative of the seemingly boundless skill of the brewer, showing a level of depth and refinement seen in no other similar beers or examples of the style.  Lemon zest; slight grain notes, perhaps from pilsner malt; and ester-derived complexity that almost indicates the addition of a wild yeast strain, in addition to the aforesaid culture.  The finish is nicely dry and crisp.  Overall, perhaps the benchmark of the Belgian Pale Ale style, and an absolutely excellent effort.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

985,"2010-11-06",3.0,"Bottle. 12 oz. Split with Vin. Pours an insanely light, almost blonde, yellow with an initially rich and creamy white head, which recedes to leave a slight lace across the surface. Aroma of light hay, lemon, honey, and bits of pepper and yeasty dough. Medium bodied with a soft, very finely carbonated palate. Finish is calm and almost nonexistent. This is an odd ale, especially from Russian River. Not much to it, very little flavor or body, and certianly no sour. Hopefully Vinny will cut this out of the lineup and focus more energy on producing Consecration, Supplication, and Temptation.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","patrickfannon"

985,"2010-04-26",4.2,"750 ml bottle that I got in a trade. Thanks for the opportunity to try this beer! Batch #005. No mention of Brett on the bottle. Poured into my Piraat Tulip glass.

A-Body is a translucent golden hue. Pours with a 2-3 finger foamy white head that eventually fades to 1/2 finger and has perfect retention from there. Tons of lacing is left all the way down the glass. When held up to the light one can clearly see some chunks of yeast sediment floating throughout the glass. Not too much...but enough to make it almost, but not quite, perfect.

S-A nice blend of slightly tart apples, citrus, and floral hops hits the nose first. This is followed by a slight sugary sweetness and bready yeast.

T-The flavor is fairly mild upfront and showcases a hint of apple and citrus fruit flavors with a fairly mild funky yeast backbone. A big burst of floral hops comes through for the finish along with the bitterness that comes with it and a slightly funky yeast backbone. A very minimal residual bitterness lingers but is mostly dry.

P-Medium to high tingly carbonation and light somewhat yeasty body. Thinner than I would prefer in this style but still above average.

O-This is a very good Belgian Pale that could be quite sessionable. The execution of this style is done well here by Russian River. A beer that I would trade for again. Looking forward to trying more Russian River brews in the future!

985,"2009-05-12",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Honeyed biscuits spread onto peppery yeast and leafy hop bitterness in this easygoing, round Belgian-style Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam covers the hazy golden.
-This is a tad than expected. I would have preferred a slightly hoppier and drier brew.
-Effervescence is relaxing, quite soft on the tongue.
-I preferred the brett version (batch 001), but I cannot say this is not a very enjoyable quaffer.

Grassy hops with a pale malt sweetness, lemony citrus,  and some mildly spicy yeast.  The mouthfeel was light to medium-bodied and had a slightly watery texture.  Lightly carbonted.

Pours a slightly hazy yellow with a short lived white head that recedes fairly quickly and leaves only spotty lacing.

The aroma is sweet with wheat and yeast as the main contributors with some light fruits as well.  There is an herbal spice presence that leaves a little bit of burn in the nose.

The taste has the same sweetness with wheat forming the backbone for the other flavors.  There is some fruity sweetness in the middle before the finish brings in the herbal spices and also a hints of lemony tartness in the finish.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth for the style with lots of carbonation.

985,"2009-02-23",3.8,"Bottle, batch 006.  A massive, everlasting head of spongy, off-white foam caps a hazy golden body.  Thick patches of cobweb lacing coat nearly the entire glass.  The nose is dry and bretty, quite crisp overall, with notes of fresh, honey glazed wheat and cereal grains being countered by a light, floral hopping and a dose of doughy yeast.  Hints of citrus rind and orange blossoms lend a nice, perfumy touch.  Mild, peppery spice and hints of wildflowers lend just a touch of bite to the nose.  Flavors follow suit, lightly sweet from the honey notes but well balanced, fresh, and grainy overall.  Spicy lemonpepper adds a hint of zest to the dry wheat grains, with a hint of pilsner-like creaminess working wonderfully with the doughy, semi-dry yeast.  The palate is substantial, falling just on the lively side of balanced carbonation.  Some of the peppery, grassy hops linger after the finish.  This is a beautiful singel.

How: Bottle 750ml.  Batch 004, drank when about 1 year old.  Bottles from kegbear & HogtownHarry, thanks very much my friends. 
The look: Clear blond body (gets cloudy with sediments in last 2oz of bottle) topped by a medium white head
In long: Nose of fruity Belgian yeast, vanilla ice-cream and dry grassy hops.  Taste starts off with straws with strong juicy floral & fruity notes.  Bananas, citrus, dandelions, kiwis.  Vanilla soon join in, a lot of vanilla.  That beer is very well hopped but the hop character is pleasantly hard to describe.  Its grassy, floral, a bit citrusy, hints of pine-tree, more dry than bitter.  This is really is a highly drinkable light session beer.  And a pretty good one at that.   This is the type of beer than usually doesnt score well on ratebeer.

Medium mouthfeel: chewy honey, lightly peppery yeast, and plenty of well-attenuated Belgian fruit; a touch overripe but nicely dry and very drinkable; crisp and pleasant Belgian.

750mL bottle, batch 005, courtesy of cloudskipper.  Thanks, Chris!  Pours a clear golden color with an orange tinge; fluffy white head with good retention and lacing that coats the glass; a gorgeous pour.  Lots of gorgeous, resiny pine / citrus bitterness in the aroma, coupled to a creamy, vanilla-y and toasty Belgian core; nicely dry, resiny, and mouthwatering; excellent well-hopped Belgian nose.  Lively carbonation.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: this has a perfect presence in the mouth: lively, resiny hoppiness (minerals, citrus, and light pine) with a very creamy, yeasty Belgian profile at the center, following the aroma: toasty malts, vanilla notes, and honey; just an intensely drinkable, mouthwatering example of a hoppy Belgian beer that doesnt bill itself as such.

985,"2008-07-26",4.4,"Batch 005; Sampled July 2008
An average pour still manages to produce a four-finger thick, pale, off-white colored head into my large Tripel Karmeliet glass.  As the head slowly recedes it forms a mesa that sits in the middle of my glass and slopes down to meat the sides of the glass where ample lacing patterns are left sticking to the walls.  Amazingly enough, despite slowly working my way through this beer, the head never has anything less than a full covering of white froth.  The beer is a clear, amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, bright, lightly orange tinged, full gold color when held up to the light.  The aroma starts with a blast of expressive fruit notes; these are a mix of ripe pear, honeydew and golden raisins.  Other fresh aromatics of honeysuckle, sweet flower nectar, and wild flower honey also add the  sweeter smelling notes in the aroma.  A backdrop of spiciness is here though; substantial enough to anchor this beer solidly I can smell notes of bergamot, white pepper, piquant ginger, light clove and some sharp, though light, herbal notes.  Hints of crushed saltine crackers and crushed malt are just noticeable if you really dig for them.  This is a fantastically expressive aroma for a smaller beer like this; I could go on just smelling this for minutes on end.

Sweet tasting up front, as much from fruity esters as any actual sweet malt sugars.   The beer is actually quite light and quite dry, but the sweetness really is accentuated by other flavor components other than residual sugars left in the beer.  While sweet and fruity up front this finishes quite dry; both a noticeable hop bitterness and a spicy, almost astringent, piquant spice character helps to significantly dry the finish out.  Fruit flavors of spicy grapes, honeydew, super-ripe pear as well as perfectly sweet, wild flower nectar are offset by spicy notes of pepper, dried ginger, spicy higher alcohols, sharp clove, .  This is light bodied, but definitely has some heft to it that keeps this clinging a bit to the palate.  An ample carbonation offsets this as it scrubs the palate with a peppery carbonic bite.

This manages to pull off a huge presence in both nose and palate, despite being a pretty easy drinking, lighter brew.  A deep complexity manages to be eminently well integrated; this is a perfect beer for those who want to contemplate the intricacies of their beer as well as those who just want an incredibly solid, great tasting beer to session a couple of.  A second pour of this beer accents a touch of yeastiness in the nose that seems to temper the fruit notes a bit with some raw dough aromas.  This really is just a fantastic interplay between fruity esters, piquant spiciness and quaffability.

Wow, I knew this should be good, but I can’t believe how good this really is.  I wasn’t expecting to like this as much as the Brett-laden batch 001, but I might even like this one more.  A fantastically tasty creation; I am continuously wowed by Vinnie’s craftsmanship and ability to achieve such well integrated, balanced beers.  Russian River seems to operate on another plane of existence than the other American brewers.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Batch 04
Bottled 12/28/07

Recieved this in a recent trade with jhenry04, thanks Jason! Redemption pours a polished brass with tiny particles that the torrent of large natural carbonation bubbles keep suspended. A bubbly two + finger cottony white head appeared on the pour and fell to a pillowy creaminess after some time leaving thick spotty lacing on the way down. The carbonation keeps the head in place throughout.

My nose is greeted with all sorts of fruitiness and spices. Green apple skins, underipe banana, and a touch of sweet pineapple toward the back. The yeast brings along a solid sprinkling of white pepper. Each swirl of the glass briefly brings forward some bubble gum. A robust nose for such a low abv. Reminds me of a quality tripel without the booziness.

The flavor follows along the lines the nose suggested although not quite as bold. The fruitiness really comes together well although a little muddled at times. A dusty yeastiness presents itself on the swallow. The bold yeastiness really brings this brew toghether nicely over the pale maltiness.

The mouthfeel is where it should be. A healthy carbonation keeps the light body flowing. A slightly chalky finish comes about before the bone dryness. I love a nice dry Belgian, whether its a saison or pale.

The refreshing quality and lower abv. make this a no brainer session beer. Good for a warm Summer day.

Another good beer from Russian River. They never fail to dissapoint. They hit the nail on the head with a style thats tough to come across. I wouldnt mind another bottle or two of Redemption.

The aroma is fruit, grain, banana, a hint of pine, generally rather sweet but light and with qualities of both a witbier and lager.  The taste is almost like a light-bodied bitter-pilsner-hefewiezen blend at first, with a lot of light fruit, light grain, citrus, hints of pine and herbs, some yeast, and a finish of grain, fruit and herbs.

Pour is light golden with a generous head.  Smells are hay, belgian sugar.  Sweet and grainy, but not harsh.  Very drinkable.  This may not quite fit the session definition, but barring the expense, I could easily put this into one of my favorite lower alcohol beers to drink.  Very very good.  Just lovely!","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
985,"2008-01-27",3.7,"Approximately 6 oz. sample from 750 mL bottle consumed at tennisjoels tasting on 1-26-08. Batch 002. This was the fifth of ten beers that we tried. Thanks to jjbreadbowl for picking this up for me at the brewpub on his trip to California. This is my first Russian River beer, and Im looking forward to trying more. This was also my first Abbey Enkel (a.k.a. Singel), a classic style that deserves its own designation in the RateBeer database. Very nice, sweet, slightly tart aroma features honey, apricot, peach skin, and raspberry scents. Pours a cloudy, very pale gold, almost gray color. Large amount of near-white head. Nice, dry, fruity, floral taste with a large apricot presence. Subdued but good flavors. Slightly dry finish. Light body. Creamy in the palate. Easy to drink. This would make a great every day beer if it were more readily available. It also seems to be sessionable (of course, its far too high in alcohol to count as a true session beer). Russian River Redemption was a big hit among all of the people at the tasting, which included RateBeerians and casual beer drinkers alike.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
985,"2008-01-26",4.2,"Batch 002 poured from a 750 into a Duvel tulip. Body is golden with a solid three fingers of bright white fluffy foam on top. Absentmindedly I pour out every last drop of the bottle without looking at the yeast sediment, resulting in SHEETS of yeast floating around. Flat, 1 square inch yeast sheets cling to the beer/head division, and some of it sinks down to the carbonation nucleation point at the very bottom of the glass only to be shot back upwards by the column of bubbles! This beer all of a sudden looks like a lava lamp! 

Aromas of overripe apples, pears, lemon, brett (not overpowering funk though). 

Flavors of citrus, grain, yeast. A very mellow and subtle beer. 

Light and airy without being thin-bodied (if that makes any sense). Goes down really smooth and could even be sessionable.

It was slightly cloudy because some of the yeast got into the glass, but I like to drink the yeast anyway. The aroma isnt what I expected. It had a good malty body with some woodsy hop aroma. There is also an overall yeasty smell behind everything else. The flavor is fairly sweet but with some hop bitterness to balance. I can actually taste some hops as well.

985,"2007-09-16",3.8,"Batch 2. A mid-sized white head quickly fades and gives full revelation to a clouded deep yellow/light orange pour. Copious coagulated protein chunks, a la Abbaye des Rocs, clutter the glow. Spotty, irregular lacing. Aromatic complexity is as soft as it gets whilst retaining an elegance reserved for very few beers, particularly Belgian golden ales. Everyhting is subtle and restrained, but not without a streamlined and clean crispness and regal quality. Notes of superb Belgian yeast, light candi sugar, fresh grain, coriander and lemon zest in moderation, very light tangerine rind, a respectable maize component and no alcohol whatsoever comprise the bulk of the aroma. The remainder, in very small quantities, includes mint, honey and freshly picked white flowers. The nose is great, though Id prefer greater expression, at least of the yeast. It does topple the pyramid in one aspect, one that is most laudable: it is so clean its heavenly. The flavor is very refreshing. Astringency is multifarious, with a breakdown of familiar acids as such - 60% lemon, 30% honey and 10% orange. Lovely malt, very clean throughout. Candi sugar is fully and perfectly utilized and never overzealous. The finish is lightly sweet and lightly sticking, lengthy and soft, peppery yeast and fruit lingering. The palate is silky soft and light bodied. Medium carbonation results in a great, easygoing, sessionable Belgian golden ale for the ages. This is great no matter what its compared to.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

The flavor is somewhat mild like the aroma, but still quite tasty.  Not extremely complex.  Has more of a citric orange flavor mixed in with some candy sugar and sweet malts.  Just a touch of a little funk and spice, but nothing over the top.  Not mind blowing, but another nicely crafted brew from Russian River.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"

Somewhat sweet but not overly so, light tartness. Very tasty for such a light beer.","California, USA","ABUSEDGOAT"
985,"2007-08-12",3.1,"Didnt notice a batch number. Very thin head. Not a lot of aroma but hints of spice and lemon. Medium cloudy yellow. Starts light, then a busy middle and finish. Trying to be funky and farmhouse and ends up more like a day at the beach.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
985,"2007-08-03",4.2,"Pale golden. Fluffy white maintains a fine layer of creaminess as it collapses at a relatively quick pace.  Bright notes of honeysuckle, herbs, aniseed, pineapple, and honeydew melon delight the olfactory senses, along with inklings of crackers, straw, and minerals. Very perfumey. Robust and fairly loose carbonation. Virtually weightless first sip reveals airy phenols and an acidic sparkle of honeydew and unripe peaches. Honeysuckle flavors accentuate and seemingly prolong the slick fruitiness, though the body is slightly flabby. Malts are extracted cleanly and do showcase some pleasant straw and cracker aspects, but their lack of depth fails  to match and  enhance the crunchy, palate-scrubbing phenols. Undeniably quenching, quaffable and clean. Leafy herbs sharpen their bite toward the latter half and pierce the layer of flabbiness. Bitterness is beautifully restrained, yet possesses a sharp herbal and grassy quality which is underlined by a rounded lemony tartness. Finishes dry with a brisk phenolic snap, as well as slickly fruity with lemon oil, melon and a present yet underutilized malt-derived starchiness. Lingering malts teeter on the edge of grainy. While this batch is well constructed, I prefer the deeper Pilsner maltiness of the first batch. Top-notch stuff, though. Simply stunning in all its modesty, yet staggeringly complex at the same time. This still ranks as one of the best session beers on the planet, even without the brett. Vinnie sure knows how to get the most out of his yeast.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

A sparkle of pear and champagne taste leads.  Dandelion stems and spinach leave strange vegetal creases on a buttery malt body.  Cloves finish.  A touch of creaminess in the mouth is slightly misplaced.  Sprightly and sharp otherwise.  A bit quiet with a very understated complexity, almost kept in secret.  Thanks Keith!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

985,"2007-06-04",4.5,"750ml bottle, Batch 002. Head is initially large, frothy, white, mostly lasting. Body is hazy medium yellow, bottle conditioned.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation. Belgian golden ales just dont get much tastier, cleaner, or more complex than this. Yes, its got a bit less going on in the nose and less tartness than the perfect 5 that was Bretty Redemption, but whats left is still nothing short of amazing.

985,"2007-04-18",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2008 From a 750mL Bottle, Batch 004.  Pours a crystal clear, transparent color of brass, topped with a thick head of foamy white.  Fruity and lightly spicy fruit esters, rich with smooth apple and pear, livened by some restrained earthy pepper.  A fresh styrian goldings hop dose adds a wonderful herb garden floral character.  Medium light bodied, heavy carbonated mouthfeel with a smooth, almost creamy texture.  A pleasant, bready malt body up front on the palate, along with touches of wheat acidity.  Light and easy drinking, but wonderfully malty as well.  Classic Belgian yeast esters come out mid-palate, creating an earthy, birch bark perfume when combined with the garden fresh hops.

985,"2007-04-12",4.4,"Lots and lots of full pours at PP Belgian Fest on 3/24/07I proudly proclaimed that Id give this as high a score as the bottled version, upon trying it.  But I think that was a bit of overzealousness caused by the moment and how incredibly good this stuff is.  But, I cant deny that the brett makes it a more enjoyable beer, with light tartness, more crispness and complexity and, in my mind, no drawbacks.  The brett dosent dominate the beer, nor does it take away from the generous, but well-attenuated maltiness and clean, elegant, plastery-like saccharomyces nuances.The appearance is similar to the bottled version, almost identical, of course, but for the much more controlled, smaller white head.  Still a good bit of it, with light lacing left behind on the glass and a high clarity in the blonde liquid.Ill just say that for my money, this is about as good as saccharomyces gets.  Very light, clean esters are neither overly sharp or exuberantly fruity, but yield more pear/nectarine/grapeskin-like notes.  In concert with the delicate honey notes collected from the malt, its one of the most elegant and understated aromas out there.  Soft dough/plaster and very light vanilla sit on the end, further emphasizing the yeast.  Minimal, peppery and grassy hops show only light aromatics and no bitterness, as an abbey singel should.  Tough to put in to words such an understated, reserved beer, and for most, it will just come off as ""too light"" or ""weak"".  Not in my opinion, thats for sure.Terrific balance is foremost its greatest factor in the flavor, possibly tied with drinkability.  Very slightly chewy malt adds almost a wheat-like consistency and gives light vanilla, cream and lemon notes through the middle, that give quite a bit of flavor, for the beers size.  A flavor that I can only describe as rose water, or some type of floral-infused spring water, with a touch of pearskin, hangs about as well, climaxing on the finish, along with a pinch of nuttiness and light grain.  Divinely clean with just a pinch of spicy phenolics on the end.  Light carbonation, very strong texture for its size.  Delicious and the best session beer on the market, IMHO.  A lot of craftmanship to see here, if you take your time with it (or drink 5 or 6 glasses of it).  Repeat after me, ""Quality, not Quantity.""","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

985,"2004-06-14",3.5,"Draught @ OBriens San Diego
The beer pours translucent amber with a generous white head that spumescent in texture and the lace a satin sheet to cover the glass. Nose has a nice malt sweetness, a hint of banana or maybe its pineapple, also seemed to be a hint of yeast, fresh and clean to the olfactory senses, start is sweetly malt and the top light to moderate in its feel. Finish is hop spicy, the acidity prickly and I found it to be a good drinking beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
985,"2004-06-07",3.2,"This brew pours with a clear golden body topped by a thin, white head with little lacing.  The aroma is slightly sweet yet sour with a slight barnyard and a touch of spice.  The flavor is slightly bitter and spicy with a very little barnyard, some malt and a touch of sweetness.  Medium bodied, slightly tingly and a touch dry.","San Diego, California, USA","Vac"
985,"2004-06-03",3.1,"(Draft: OBriens in San Diego, CA) This Belgian ""single"" is basically like a simple Belgian golden ale; Mildly spicy with moderately bitterness that becomes more prominent in the finish; Lightly sweet with only a mild amount of maltiness; Lightly malty nose; Light golden color and slightly cloudy; The off-white head started off as an island and shrunk very quickly before my eyes until nothing was left, but all the while, always floating in the center of the glass, not the edges -- very strange","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
