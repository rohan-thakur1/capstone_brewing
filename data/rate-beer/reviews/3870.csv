3870,"2016-08-15",4.3,"yum yum. Wheaty hop joose strikes again. Very drinkable and saturated with hop juice without bitterness.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
3870,"2016-07-31",4.3,"16 oz can shared with Gus. The pour is a turbid orange juice color with a thick white head and a ton of lace as it falls. The aroma is bright citra hop. There is a juiciness and a strong dry hop. There is a hint of bitterness on the back end, but the good are magic. Its really good. The flavor is excellent. The citra juiciness is killer. There is a strong citra hop and a beautiful bright dry hop bitterness. Its really complex and great. The juiciness is just lovely. The mouth feel is lighter and crisp with an excellent carbonation and w lingering dry bitter juicy hoppiness carrying all the way out the end. This is great!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3870,"2016-07-20",4.2,"Can thanks to Matt, brew date 06/10/2016. Pours totally OJ murky and orange, large puffy off-white head, dissipates slowly leaving clumpy lacing. I love me my milkshake IPAs :). Aroma is light but juicy, oranges, mango, passionfruit, grapefruit. Flavor is light sweet, light bitter and really really juicy. Not really a flavor explosion like some, but really well integrated with a touch of lingering bitterness to remind you that its not actually a smoothie. Fullish body, creamy mouthfeel. Kudos to Tree House.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3870,"2016-07-13",4.1,"Can, 1 pint. A cloudy golden beer with a medium size white head. Citric aromas with orange, floral hopps and malt. Taste is moderately sweet and bitter. Medium bodied with fizzy carbonation and moderate astringency. Rich hoppy character and a very well balanced malty aftertaste. The ""fake Julius"" tho.","MEXICO","Percy0103"
3870,"2016-07-13",4.3,"Can, 1 pint. Opaque milky golden with a frothy light tan head. Aromas of floral hops, citrus, caramel, resin. Full bodied, moderate carbonation. Smooth and creamy. Medium sweet, medium to heavy bitter. Rich roasted and hoppy character into an exquisite hoppy finish. One of the most delicious IPAs Ive come across.","Mexico City, MEXICO","Sdaniel90"
3870,"2016-07-07",4.1,"Mid-June 2016 can drunk 6/25/16.Large, white head tops a heavily hazy, graham cracker-orange-golden body. Good retention.I have a lot of respect for Julius (though Im more of a tornado and eureka guy) but its funny how rabid everyone gets for these slight variations. After having doppelganger earlier in the evening, I was initially shocked how similar this was until I remembered that doppelganger (and alter ego) are also Julius variants. I find regular Julius just a touch too sweet compared to green and haze and sap (and even alter ego seems less sweet) and theres no difference here. Juicy fruits in the nose shine with mango, pineapple, lychee and stonefruit. Lots of honey behind it with no alcohol or flaw and no resin.The texture is soft, malty and the balance runs lightly on the sweet side with honey and even a bit of caramel. Heavily juicy, of course. Excellent, of course. But youd never be able to tell the two apart blind.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3870,"2016-06-27",4.1,"Can, picked up earlier in the day from the brewery. Have you ever had Julius? This tastes pretty much exactly like that, with maybe a little bit more pungent hop flavor. And, really, what isnt there to love about an amped up Julius?","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate citrus, grass, tropical fruits, mango, and mild lemon peel. Its a milky dull orange with a one finger white head that fades to a minimal a thin film outlined by a thicker ring. The flavor starts with moderate tropical fruits, orange/citrus, and mango. The finish has light-moderate grapefruit, dank hops, grass, and mild orange peel. Its light-medium bodied with mild carbonation and a somewhat soft mouthfeel.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3870,"2016-06-23",4.5,"Poured from can into a tulip: Pours disgustingly chunky milky orange, it really isnt a pretty beer. Aroma is bright orange, grapefruit, papaya, and a little malt sweetness. Taste is more of the same, slightly grassy also, a little sweet and acidic. They manage to pack insane amounts of juicy citra goodness into a can, and its incredibly enjoyable. The only negative is the appearance, but who cares. Awesome beer.","Willington, Connecticut, USA","bellco33"
3870,"2016-06-21",4.6,"Can thanks to Kyle. Pours a cloudy orange with medium frothy off white leaving sticky lacing. The aroma is strong mango, tangerine, grapefruit, must. Insanely juicy, so much citrus, crushable, really impressive.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3870,"2016-06-15",4.4,"Side by side taste with Julius. This one was better but barely recognizable difference. Cloudy milky orange color with minimal white head. Aroma is intense orange, papaya, melon, mango, grapefruit, and floral. Taste is light bitter, moderate sweet, and a touch of bright acidity that is very welcome and makes the citrus notes really pop. Insanely chuggable.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
3870,"2015-07-04",3.9,"750ml growler in a teku. Pours hazy golden with a white head. Aroma of citrusy and fruity hops, some pale malts, vegetal notes, and some dough. Flavor the same, very fruity and citrusy, but a little too raw on the hops. Average texture. Very good, but normal Julius is better in my opinion.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
