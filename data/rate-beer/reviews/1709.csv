1709,"2014-09-20",3.8,"Transfer review from notes-
 
 Served on tap in a chalice glass

 Appearance  The beer is served a light orange amber color with a one finger head of pure white foam. The head has a good level of retention very slowly fading to leave a decent level of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is big of a yeasty and banana smell with a moderately strong showing of a wheaty smell. Along with these aromas comes some lighter notes of an orange nature as well as some spice aromas of a clove and coriander. Some candied sugar and bubblegum aromas are there as well creating a rather pleasant hefe aroma overall.

 Taste As the nose would have suggested the taste begins with a nice hit of wheat bread and yeast. At the same time some very fruity flavors are present as well with orange, peach and lemon all being there. These upfront flavors create a nice base flavor for the brew, lasting through the entire flavor profile. Some spice and a good showing of bubblegum and candied sugar develop more toward the middle reaching their maximum potency once they fully develop toward the middle. The sweeter sugary flavors fade ever so slightly as the taste moves onto the end, being overtaken by a bit more spice and some grassy and hay flavors. In the end the mix of wheaty, yeasty and spicy, fruit and sugary sweetened tastes leaves a very pleasantly smooth flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel The body of the beer is quite light and thin with a carbonation level that is on the higher side. For the style and the tastes the mouthfeel is very nice, making for a very easy drinker.

 Overall  A quite tasty hefe that is very easy drinking and quite balanced overall.","","Darkmagus82"

1709,"2014-05-31",3.2,"10/11 A 0.75 l bottle from Vrutak store, Zagreb. It poured hazy light yellow body with big head. Fine weizen aroma, some orange, pepper, cloves, yoghurt, but also positively peculiar things like wood and curry. Flavor was lightly sweet, pleasant, but way too watery. Some chalky yeasty notes seemed dominant in vague dilution of orange, banana and spice essences. Although thin it had fine herbal and lightly aromatic orange finish that actually did manage to round it up nicely. Needless to say, since it was rather expensive, I expected much better. I also dare to say many of these high rates came from its price as well.","Split, CROATIA","heavy"

Aroma has some banana and clove, bit apple indeed, some citrus, hint of coriander seed, bit spicy, bit in between a belgian white and a german hefeweizen. Quite bitter in taste for a weizen, not much sweetness, quite dry actually. I dont know which new Hallertau variety they tried, but I would like to see it in some other styles I think, as I doubt hefeweizen is the perfect match for it. Belgian white meets German Hefeweizen meets French Champagne. Sounds unbalanced, which is not the case. Its actually very well made, just dont expect a true weizen.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"

Decent, but Im missing from the taste the fruity banana, which seems to disappear in these hopfenweissen and this feels a bit too light in the end. A bit too sweet as well.

1709,"2013-03-24",3.7,"750ml bottle. Cloudy golden colour with average to huge, frothy, fairly lasting, white head. Very nice hoppy, fruity and minimally bretty aroma. Taste is fresh citrusy, cautious wheat malty basis, hoppy overtones, cautious hints of brett in the finish; lively carbonation. Excellent refreshing summer beer.","Bielefeld, GERMANY","Idiosynkrasie"
