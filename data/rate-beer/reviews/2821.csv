2821,"2017-05-14",3.9,"On tap at Underground. Pours a fairly clear gold with a medium sized white head. Brightly floral hops on the nose, a touch of quick and clean grain. Medium bodied, clean grain, a bit of crisp crackers. Light and easy, crisp with some nice floral tones. Crisp, easy, pretty.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
2821,"2017-05-10",3.6,"On tap at a Churchkey event, pours a clear gold with some white head. Perfume nose, honey, melon. Flavor is the same, some metal but honey, melon and perfume. Heavy lilac. Watery finish.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
2821,"2017-04-24",4.0,"Une Pilsener au joli look bien que légèrement pâle. Dentelles présentes sur mon verre. Un amalgame de fleurs violettes et blanches au nez. Très parfumé et ça sent presque le savon ou le pot-pourri. Ce genre darômes me coupe habituellement lenvie dy plonger les lèvres mais ici ça fonctionne et même agréablement bien. Mince en bouche et encore une fois très florale. Je note le fruit de la fermentation à basse température mais ce dernier me paraît perdu dans un énorme bouquet de fleurs. Aucune amertume, toute en aromatique. Très intéressante et plaisante. Un verre suffit toutefois.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

2821,"2017-01-25",4.0,"Pint at brewery, another fantastic highly drinkable beer. The hops add a herbal and grass accent to the malt forward rich style of a pilsner.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
2821,"2016-12-30",4.0,"On tap at the brewery: Pours clear golden with a fluffy white head. Aroma of cracker malt, grass, light spice. Taste is more of the same, very grassy and a decent hop bite but it doesnt overwhelm the clean crispness of this really great lager. Light to medium body, dry finish, just mildly sweet, awesome pils.","Willington, Connecticut, USA","bellco33"
2821,"2016-12-25",3.6,"A nice hoppy pils. Clear pale with paper white head. Aroma is grassy herbal hops and cracker malts. Taste is light bitter with the hops a bit too strong for the base beer. Otherwise a very tasty beer as is everything at sfb.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"

2821,"2016-09-18",3.7,"The Well, Brooklyn tap: pours golden with a white head. Aroma is citrus, grass and bread. Basically, this is a well made, super clean, very easy drinking pils with enough complexity to make it stand out.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
2821,"2016-09-16",3.5,"Nice floral hop aroma. Taste is a malty Pilsner. Slight flavor of the floral hops but mostly a crisp Pilsner. Still has some of the Pilsner foot funk lager taste. Well made and nice overall but pilsners just are not my jam, although the nice hop aroma does add to this one and makes it quite a bit better.
