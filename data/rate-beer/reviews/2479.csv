2479,"2017-06-09",3.6,"Aromas are very malty - a mix of several different aromas though all of them individually quite mild - bread, dried plums, roasted coffee, toffee. Very little hop presence.

Color is a somewhat dark reddish brown. Large tan head.

Mild to moderate sweetness; low level of bitterness.

Medium bodied; average carbonation; slightly high alcohol level is not too apparent; finish is medium to long, sweet and malty.

Overall its not bad - there are a fairly wide variety of aromas. However they are all very mild and they blend together in a bit of a muddled way.","Michigan, USA","smroush"

2479,"2017-05-30",3.4,"Typical doppelbock aroma and flavor of nuts, toffee, molasses, and a little touch of iced tea. Clear brown in color.

2479,"2017-05-25",4.6,"Pours with an attractive thin light brown foam. Color is cloudy Coca-Cola. Quite fresh aroma has mämmi and faint dried plum, raisins and dates. Some cooked flour. Palate is well balanced, although quite yeasty and floury. Taste is bready and rich in dark malts. The finish has a long lasting bitternerness and dryness. Quite interesting. Ive known Weihenstephaner only from their wheat beers, but this displays that the brewery is versed in other beer styles as well. The Korbinian retains qualities familiar from Weihenstephaners wheat beers (like smoothness and elegant taste and aroma), but does in a different style. I find that the Korbinian is not that enjoyable (even if its a good beer) on its own, but I imagine that it would be amazing when paired with the proper foods.","Jyväskylä, FINLAND","mviljamaa"

Helder donker kastanjebruin bier met een robijnrode gloed, beige romige schuimkraag, die na verloop van tijd wel inzakt. Prachtig aroma, heel moutig en veel gedroogd fruit als rozijnen, pruimen verder ook veel nootachtige elementen in het aroma. Walnoot, hazelnoot, chocoladecake, koffie en aardachtige tonen. Werkelijk een indrukwekkend aroma deze Duitse Doppelbock. Het mondgevoel is zacht fluwelig met een lichte carbonatie, alcohol van 7,4% is nauwelijks waarneembaar, eigenlijk volledig verborgen. Wel een opvallend complex smaakpallet met zeer moutige en granige tonen. Verder rozijnen, pruimen, gebakken banaan, chocolade en een iets kruidige en aardachtige afdronk.

A: Pours into the glass the color of mahogany wood or very, very dark cherry wood. Shining an iPhone light through the beer reveals bright red highlights, and columns of bubbles. The head forms a bit over a finger thick of pale beige, with good retention. Lacing may as well be a sheet of bubbles permanently etched into the glass.

S: Rich, bready caramel-toffee malt scents, wreathed with hints of chocolate. Theres what seems to be a bit of dark fruit in the nose as well.

T: Warm, yeasty dark bread fills the mouth from the first sip. Some sweet toffee slithers along the sides of the bread through the middle, and some notes of walnut and cooked raisin waft through background of the flavor palate beside a faint cocoa tinge. By the finish, there is a distinct note of hardwood, like oak or maple. No hop presence to speak of, which is perfect.

M: While full and sticky, the mouthfeel is surprisingly not quite as thick for a doppelbock as I would hope, feeling closer to a bock.

O: This is a beautiful doppelbock example, a tour de malt with virtually zero hop flavors involved. A little additional dark fruit complexity to the flavor profile, and a slightly thicker mouthfeel, and this would approach perfect 5 territory for me.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

2479,"2014-08-09",4.1,"Served on tap in a chalice glass
 Appearance  The beer is served a deep brown color with a one finger head of off white foam. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave a good level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the beer is heaviest of a bready toasted malt smell along with a decent showing of some dark fruits of prune and raisin. Along with these aromas are some smells of cocoa, toffee, and caramel. A little bit of grass and some coffee are there as well, giving just a hint of bitterness to an otherwise sweet and roastey malted smelling brew. 
 Taste  The taste begins much crisper then I was anticipating, with a nice roasted malt base and a decent showing of some sweeter flavors of caramel and molasses. As the taste advances the roasted flavors remain rather strong while the initial caramel and molasses lose some ground, but with them being replaced by some light dark fruit flavors of plum and cherry. Some chocolate and a lighter coffee flavor work their way into the taste profile as well, and with a little bit of a grassy and herbal flavor coming to the tongue as well, one is left with a surprisingly crisper, but still quite roasty and sweet flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is slightly thinner and crisper side with a carbonation level that is on the average to slightly higher side. The slightly thinner body and higher carbonation actually work for this beer even though it is rather dark; as the feel really crates a crisp and very easy drinking but highly flavorful brew.
 Overall  This is a very flavorful doppelbock with a very easy drinking and crisp feel in light of its abv. of 7.4 %. This is one nice drinker and one I will certainly come back to again.","","Darkmagus82"

2479,"2014-05-16",4.3,"For my 1000th review on rate beer, I found the notes to this beautiful brew.
I poured this into a weizen glass.
The appearance was a dark murky brown almost close to black, but it had a nice settling off white to white foamy head that allows a nice dissipation at a nice pace.
The smell had a deep dark chocolate to banana maltiness invading my nose powerfully.
The taste was allocated well between the chocolate malts and the banana esters to produce an indulgent dessert-like flavoring. There is a nice chocolate banana like aftertaste with a quick dry finish.
On the palate, it sits about a medium on the body with a decent carbonation for its style and comes across well to me. Sessionability - maybe, but for me I tend to find this one more as a sipper and well worthy of a dessert in and of itself.

Appearance: The body has a beautiful color, crystal clear and garnet. The head is tall with moderate density, slowly settling into a dense light tan coating.
Aroma: Deep caramel and biscuit malt notes are backed by hints of raspberry and apple. The aroma is mild in presence, but smells malty with hints of fruit, perfect.

It is like taking a sniff of a chocolate cake with dark fruits in it. Utterly more-ish and I wish I could share this with my beloved mother who adores such things. The flavour is marked first by prickly sharp carbonation and then sharp astringent juiciness. It wasnt what I was expecting at all, not to say that I am disappointed. It has a just-ripening plumminess about it and then it sucks the liquid out of your mouth revealing tart redcurrant, raspberry and rhubarb.

2479,"2013-03-04",3.7,"Much like the hefeweizen, the doppelbock is a style the Germans do best. I was excited to try Weihenstephaner Korbinian since its the doppelbock made by the worlds oldest brewery - how much more authentic can you get? And while its a good beer for sure, its not quite a great one. Still, theres a lot to enjoy and appreciate here.

I poured a 500ml bottle into a lager glass.

Appearance: Seemingly opaque brown hue, but actually a deep violet or ruby red. Forms a large, tan, soapy head which leaves some lacing and never completely dissipates.

Smell: Classic doppelbock aroma of pure malt essence, but milder than most. Dark fruit notes, but no alcohol. 

Taste: Weihenstephaner Korbinian starts out with a gentle delivery of dark fruit, molasses and a hint of chocolate on the finish. Its sweet, yes, but not cloying or sticky compared to some of the syrup-like bombs out there. A touch of bitterness or tang right on the finish, but not much in the way of actual hop character. Thats fine by me because its still a flavorful, appealing palate overall.

Its quite possible my bottle was a vintage, which might explain the surprising mildness of this brew. Thats not to excuse it for being less robust than I prefer, though. The palate still works well for what it is and what it should be. 

Drinkability: Though technically a lager, Weihenstephaner Korbinian drinks not only like an ale, but a cask ale. Amazingly soft and comfortable in the mouth with a smooth texture and ridiculously easy finish. A slightly sweet aftertaste, but nothing overbearing. The 7.4% ABV is well hidden, making this drink and feel like a lighter beer than it is. Still, one 500ml serving is the perfect amount.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Glass: Manzanita pint glass 
From: Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, Calif. 
Price: $3.49 
Misc.: Part of the bottle reads Brewed under the purity law, of 1516.

Poured a mahogany, almost black color with about a finger of khaki tan head that dissipated rather quickly. Very light lacing on the sides, pretty weak retention on the top.

Smelled a sharp whiff of malty alcohol right away. Very malty, including roasty, nutty, dark chocolate, toffee, dark fruit and some kind of liquor (maybe rum?) Late I got some smoky fire and coffee beans. Despite the high presence of alcohol, the flavors work together in the nose. 

Just a fantastic first taste. Still heavy with the malts, mainly dark fruit (cherry, plum, raisin, fig) and chocolate (not as dark as the smell). A little bit roasty and toffee, ending with a lingering bitter but smooth finish.

Medium body. Slick texture. Soft (below average) carbonation. Long bitter and smooth finish.

Chocolate and chestnut colors with a good-sized tan colored head. Midway through the glass, a dark cherry color appears as well.

Roasted malt is the most predominant smell, along with figs and molasses. A very pleasant aroma.

The malt is the overpowering taste at first, with its roasted flavors. Then figs, raisins, and molasses come along for the ride. A small amount of alcohol and hops sneak in toward the end, but at the end the malt reminds you it is in charge.

This is one very smooth. It is definitely carbonated enough to keep a good head, but it has such a creamy finish. Wonderful.

2479,"2011-03-23",3.5,"500 ml bottle purchased at Royal in KCMO. 1350 stamped on the bottle. Pour is a dark ruby and brown, mostly clear with a big three inch tan head that is quite lasting. When it falls, there is nice etched lacing. Aroma is cracked grain maltiness, some dark dried fruit sweetness, and a very small bit of garlic and clove yeast. Taste is very much about the malt, which presents cleaner than the nose - just a very full mildly sweet cracker toasty maltiness. The raisin and yeast is present as well, particularly in the long finish. Chocolate cocoa notes are in here. There is something of a honey floral aspect that is drying and lightly bitter in the aftertaste as well.  Much going on in the taste, with interesting transitions.

2479,"2010-06-13",4.4,"Aroma: This lagers aroma is undoubtedly that of a German Doppelbock. There is a maple syrup quality that is accented with caramelized malts and a slight smoke character. The nose on this is very complex and rich. With a mild swirl notes of dried figs and prunes emerge to compliment the malt. I think I can find just the faintest hint of herbal spice.
Appearance: A gorgeous reddish dark brown which retains its translucence when held up to the light. The head was glorious when fist poured and has retained a thick, tan foam across the surface of the beer. 
Taste/Palate: So, for a doppelbock this lager is surprisingly light bodied. Not to take away anything from the extreme complexity of the beer, just noticing that it retains the lightness of body to be easily drinkable. The first sip reveals a rich, roasty and somewhat sweet lager. Upon further inspection the dried fruit character shoots fourth with some of that maple and caramel. The best thing about drinking this lager is the bitter finish. The roasted malt and light hops come together in the finish to clean up the palate and refresh the mouth. That is what makes this beer feel so light to drink. The aftertaste lingers forever and really grows in texture and flavor. Im continuing to get bitter chocolate and coffee flavors mixed with herbal toffee. This beer is a great after dinner treat! 
Overall: Many doppelbocks have I tried and been made almost sick from the left over sugar sweetness. I am happy to report that this beer is well balanced! Im a fan of all beer. The darker ales and lagers have been loosing favor with me in recent years because I just have not had the will to drink the heavy muck the ""big beer"" brewers have been putting out lately. This beer has garnered a special place in my book of tasty things and might lead me down the road of dark once again.","USA","Bludwig"

Appearance: The body has a dark brown color with lighter brownish red highlights. On top sits a nice light tan head which was about two fingers thick right after it was poured. This head slowly fades but hangs on till the last sip, (not that it took me long it get there lol). There was some nice slick lacing, as well, which slid right down the glass as I drank.

Smell: The aroma is pleasing and sweet with notes of dark sweet bread, cooked or burnt sugar, as well as some mellow notes of over ripe fruit and classic German hops.

Taste/Palate: It has a firm, slick, full bodied palate with a flavor profile that matches its aroma. The flavor is full dark sweet bready malty goodness. There are some hints of nuts and fruit mixed into the mostly sweet malt along with some decent leafy/spicy, almost earthy hops for balance. The hops also add a nice balance to the finish making it quite drinkable.

A bit too much wood in fact.  Medium bodied with smooth carbonation and a medium rich mouthfeel.  Malt forward with a bit of alcohol, it is a solid example of the style.

Appearance: Pours a clear, very dark reddish-brown body with a foamy, bubbly, light beige head.

Taste: Presents a pleasant taste of powdered, unsweetened chocolate and viciously crushed cola nuts sprinkled atop a thick piece of crusty, very dark bread. Modestly sweet. Lightly fruity taste of plums dunked in simple syrup. Mild bitterness midway with a touch of dried herbs.

Good god, that has got to be be richest, maltiest smelling brew Ive had in awhile. Big, rich malts with thick gourmet caramel. Loads of brown sugar and a big dallop of black strap molasses. Dates and figs are here, also. Slight hint of tobacco. Slight yeasty, breadlike notes.

Big molasses presence, tastewise. Sweet, yet dark and dry. Nice level of maltiness makes its presence known. Very slight alcohol presence. Like the nose, you get a taste of tobacco. Caramel apples. Nice taste of black bread. Notes of dates and cherries.

Sadly, this is only a medium bodied beer. A nice, big, full body would make this one an extremely lush brew. Carbonation is a bit too crisp and therefore, short. Would benefit from smoother carbonation, as it would help it be so much more creamy.

Very drinkable, in general. The rich sweetness would keep you from throwing too many back in a single sitting, though.

Smells of stew meat, caramel and sweet chocolate--not exactly attractive, but it is fascinating.  Ive never smelled this combination before in a beer.  Complex.

Rich flavor in a thin body--well not that thin, but certainly less than most bocks (not to mention doppels).  Very complex--quite dry for the style (a touch of sugar on the tongue only on the initial sip).  Surprisingly hoppy in the swallow which lingers throughout the aftertaste.

2479,"2009-07-16",3.6,"A truly unique and exceptional Doppelbock that goes with a more stout/porter malt than the typical caramel and burnt sugar malts found in other brews of this style. Aroma is brown sugar emitting from a dark amber color and small, white head. The flavor is what makes this DB stand out, slightly smokey with a 86% cocoa dark chocolate aftertaste, ok so maybe not that much but it is pretty heavy, where some DBs serve up a range of smooth malts this one has some edgier tones that no doubt makes it stand out above the rest, most of the rest that is.

2479,"2009-07-14",3.9,"Yet another Vegas trip brew

The labels various brown colours makes you think dark and thick before you even open the bottle. Pours out a nice thick light brown cap (fades a bit quicker than I hoped) on top of a nice clear dark mahogany brew that looks ooooh soo good. Right off the bat there is a weird, pungent smell here that shouldnt be - kinda like rank meat, something quite funky - fishy? I have no idea what this is. It is there sniff after sniff. Its a pisser because the aromas beyond that are quite nice: heavily roasted malts - super dark, molasses, raisins, prunes, maybe toffee. Dammit - I cannot get beyond this bizarre, disturbing smell. The taste is excellent but oddly enough Im finding something related to the aroma I dont like... aarrg. Dont matter much cause this tastes so fine: chocolate, roasted malts that are so damn thick, hidden sweetness - once i really noticed it it was obvious how it was fused throughout, almost something smokey that quickly vanishes, light spice that is not licorice, a perfect tasting bitterness, a concentrated dark orangy flavour in the back ground. Dammit - what isnt in this beer? HA! Ive just had a flashback to the soy sauce that I tasted sooo much in Sam Adams Tripel Bock - I think this is a prominent feature of the mystery smell and taste. Yes, Im getting more convinced. Full bodied, so very smooth in my mouth - absolutely soothing, slightest of carbonation. Finishes strong and memorable with a fruity hop and heavy yet gentle malts. This is an excellent beer. My mouth feels kinda like an ashtray. Wow. Bumping up the marks.... this should be higher than Ive given it but that characteristic of the aroma keeps it down. If anyone reads this and can explain that, please let me know. Nomad by Maiden blasting in the background. Good times. Get a hold of this brew and give it a go.

2479,"2008-09-02",4.0,"My Weihenstephaner Korbinian came to me in a large 22oz bottle which I promptly poured into my tall 24oz bomber glass. She poured a rich earthen brown with tinges of burnt amber accentuating her sides and the curves in the glass. A small head of foam fades into a blanket on top of my brew. As I tease her nose, brussels lace trickles down the sides with each swirl. Rich roasted malts greet my nose with sweet caramel notes, prunes, faint chocolate, and wet earth. Her succulent and almost syrupy viscous body fills my mouth with sweet malts, caramel, fresh prunes backed by lightly sweet chocolate. Semi-sweet chocolate maybe? A warm beer, she has a heavy body which thankfully doesn’t cloy too badly, otherwise she would be very hard to finish. As is, each quaff glides across my eager tastebuds and leaves a brisk, almost lemon-rind finish. For a very full body, I am surprised and delighted to find my Korbinian to have a pleasant effervescence as she warms. Malty sweet, succulent, with rich dark prunes, chocolate, spice, and a drying bitter citrus finish.

An excellent Dopplebock if I do say so myself. Ayinger’s Celebrator is still my favorite dopplebock to date, but Weihenstephaner proves that they haven’t lost their touch over centuries of brewing and perfecting their craft.

Appearance: Dark brown, looks suspiciously like Coca-Cola in my pilsener glass.

A nice balance between malt, fruit, and roast grains. Fruit and malt intermingle up front while the roast hangs out in the back, only coming forward towards the finish before alcohol puts him back in his place.

2479,"2008-03-23",3.6,"Pours a very dark red brown (but not black) with a medium khaki colored head.  Aroma is a little fruitier than I expected, especially without any hefeweizen yeast.  Theres some chocolate, cherries, rye toast tanginess, and toffee.  Pretty pleasant mix, more to offer than that, but easy to sum up.  Nutty chocolate flavor with some dark rye toast, a little cake, nuts, finishes with a toast, coffee and slight dark chocolate finish, but the aftertaste kinda cloys a bit.  In beers like this, German yeast tends to add a nice tangy contrast, and the fruit on the nose is a plus.  Medium bodied, fairly high carbonation, and despite the full flavor, it doesnt have a good creamy enveloping mouthfeel.  Pretty tasty stuff.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

Korbinian poured a caramel brown into my pilsner glass. Generous amount of small rising carbonation bubbles. A tan 2 finger head formed on the pour that, with some time, faded do a thick cap. Leaves small spotty lacing. Looks good.

The smell starts with a a deep caramel sweetness. Along the way theres some nuts, bananas, and some doughiness. Some raw grains show up as well as a mild vegetal aroma. Theres a mild metallic scent in there that doesnt belong but it fades as the beer warms. Smells good. The metallic and vegetal aromas do detract a little from the smell though.

The flavor is much like the smell without the funky vegetal flavor or metallic twang. More caramel and raw grains are the backbone and help to showcase the mild banana. The doughiness comes along mid-palate and everything ends up with some frothy milk chocolate and a touch of alcohol. Slightly acidic. Nice.

The mouthfeel seems to be a little on the thin side. Medium bodied but the thinness that starts mid-palate doesnt quite fit. There is a frothiness on the swallow that is unique and pleasant.

I could drink another one or two of these buts thats probably all. It is an enjoyable beer that I will pick up again.

Overall this is a solid doppelbock. There are some unique characteristics you dont find in other doppelbocks, unfortuanately some of them dont add to the quality. Not as hearty as some others but still a good all around beer.

The flavor is not as one-dimensional - it starts off sweet and malty but with a presence of hop bitterness and a very subtle hop flavor. There is also a toasted bread flavor creeping in around the middle. The overall flavor evokes bready desserts (like baklava - even down to the hints of honey and nuts) and fruit (dates, figs), with strong caramel flavors, too. The finish is sweet, but gently hoppy with an after-taste that leans much more towards bitter hops than malts. The mouthfeel is quite heavy - and the beer hits the stomach like a rock (very filling).

2479,"2006-09-02",4.2,"This is a magnificent and complex brew.

Appearance: Pours a mahogany brown with reddish hues. Light tan head.

Smell: I instantly thought of chocolate and caramel, but quickly aromas of brown sugar, molasses, plumbs, rum raisins and soggy rum bread, toffee, and more filled the nose. 

Taste: Big malts create a perfect foundation for dozens of additional flavors. Dark caramel, rum, dark fruits (raisins and plumbs dates), loads of cookie dough and bready flavors; subtle suggestion of toffee and nuts and a hint of German Hops. The dominate sweet character is offset by a gentle bitterness in the finish.

Mouthfeel: This beer is big and silky smooth. The velvety malt is oily slick and slides through the palate like a heavenly creamy silk.

Drinkability: Who could make a Double Bock so drinkable? Never doubt Weihenstephaner. This beer is terrific and goes down with dangerous ease.

2479,"2006-06-20",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 17, 2016 Bottle.  Opaque ruby-rosewood pour with a short yellow-tan head.  Sweet fruity aroma, grape, malty, and a touch of alcohol.  Typical bock taste with a little more dark malt than expected.  Full-bodied and velvety smooth; not really creamy or oily, but slightly warming.  Alcohol is pretty well hidden.  Fruity (grape, mostly) aftertaste.  Really pleasant and mild - Id say this is a very refined Doppelbock which seduces you with subtle flavor rather than slamming you with it. [2006.06.20: 3.9]Ive had this dozens of times over the past decade and I cant quite put my finger on what separates it from its peers -- maybe not as the best Doppelbock, but it stands alone nonetheless.  Its rich and meaty but not melanoidin soup, the malt is not developed to the extreme, and some bottles are even a bit watery.  Theres a fine layer of grape Fun Dip that sits atop the other flavors, and thats not real grape (not even foxy musky American Concord or Catawba), rather the idealized powder of post-war manufacture; still, that dusty grape is slightly different from what I perceive in the occasional aged DB, i.e., the product of abiotic reaction.  It has to be the special yeast, supremely clean but also thinning and dilutive in ways the brasher, rougher Bavarian house cultures are not ... the result is always light and flowing, concealing heft and teasing deeper complexity with both outward classiness and a better-shadowed set of nimble fingers.  Its the first of Weihenstephaners portfolio I reach for, which is saying a whole lot.  [2016.11.16: 4.4]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

2479,"2006-01-28",5.0,"Labeled a dunkels starkbier or ""dark strong beer"", this beer is a dopplebock, or double bock, by style. Dopplebocks are strong, warming, malty beers that were brewed by monks to sustain them during fasting. They have often been called ""liquid bread"" for their intense malt character. This beer quite possibly, could be the most impressive example of dopple bock ever brewed. It clearly was my favorite until I tried Andeches Dopplebock Dunkel on a trip to Germany last year. And while I did indeed find a dopple bock that I could honestly say is ""better"" than Korbinian, it is still one of the most impressive dopplebock biers being brewed today. I am stunned each and every time I drink this beer. If anyone ever had any questions as to what malt tastes like, one sip of beer will answer all those questions. 

Korbinian Dunkles Starbier pours to a beautiful, bright, deep chestnut color with thick and creamy tan head, and a moderate to soft amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is striking. Deep, deep sweet malty, toasty, and nutty aromas marry with slow and subtle waves of alcohol strength. Just smelling this beer is a better experience than drinking many beers. The palate is full and lush on the tongue with a slick and syrupy body. The malt flavors in this beer are amazingly complex, comforting, and delicious. Flavors of sweet malt, toast, nuts, slight hints of chocolate, and vanilla coat the tongue and fill the mouth. Korbinian finishes with more stunning complex malt flavors up front, then ends with a slightly cloying, warming finish that lingers. This beer is indeed strong, coming in at about 7.4% abv. 

Im floored. Last night it was my pleasure to slowly sip and savor a half liter bottle of this Teutonic nectar. And at $2.85 a half liter, it is a steal. I would not dare match this beer with food. Korbinian makes the perfect after dinner drink, and is the perfect beer to slowly work on and enjoy as you relax reading the paper or a good book.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

Mid-palate features caramel, coffee, raisin and ripe banana.  The first-rate low hop finish is decidedly smooth but manages to counterbalance the robust malt body; there is a touch of alcohol.

In the glass, its a fine teak colour with ruby highlights and a firm, lasting mat of foam. There are deliciously thick fumes of cherry liqueur, leather saddle, molasses and fresh-lacquered timber. The 7.4% alcohol is prominent in the aroma and there are spicy-medicinal Berocca notes. Its thinner in the mouth than the aroma implies, but not disastrously so - medium-bodied, rather than full. The mouthfeel is creamy-soft and the finish restrained. There are strong raisin notes in a generally malty flavour palette, plus bananas, toffee and Dundee cake. The alcohol is prominent in the flavour but well integrated. This is one of my favourite styles and this gives the superb Weltenburger Kloster Asam Bock a run for its money.

2479,"2005-08-05",4.0,"Chestnut ruby. Creamy, semi-sticky dirty-white foam. Aromatic notes of fruitcake, red licorice, pecans, and plum pudding.  Fairly rooty and woody. Very clean alcohol. Soft, mouth filling carbonation. Rounded edge of fruitiness complements the weighty malt blanket. Deeply dextrinous, as well, with a slick, candied malt underside. Succulent malt spine shows hints of toffee glazed fruitcake, which continues to shower the palate with layers upon layers of depth and sustenance to stave off the body-lessening fruitiness. Firm dried leather astringency couples with ripe prune acidity, while a cool breath of alcohol glides over a tanninlike crystallized sugar sting that attaches itself to the tongue. Finishes with a restrained richness of fruitcake topped with brown sugar, wine-steeped prunes, and nutty malt echoes. Despite the beautifully complex and polished malt showcase, theres a tad too much fruitiness that keeps the malt from hitting full stride. A lovely malt mammoth, nevertheless.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

2479,"2005-03-30",3.7,"2004 bottle.  Light burgundy red with dark stained-oak brown creates a lovely-looking body, or so I think.  Initial head is full and of a light mocha-beige color.  It recedes slowly to cover, leaving light in its wake.  Aroma of prunes, raisins, chocolate godiva liqueur and that elegant, if somewhat too clean (for my senses) weihenstephan yeast.  Very malty overall, this brewery is another one which does a great job with extraction and presentation of malts.  Flavor begins with a sweet coffee and caramel mix, plenty of malt as expected and then you get some slight bocky wininess, a dose of drying alcohol and roast and a clean, lightly sweet finish, with light fruit notes of banana and plum from the yeast.  Body is perhaps a shade too light for all of the sweetness and bold flavors, with a bit more prickly carbonation than Id prefer, but they are only minor complaints of mine, and overall, I drank this beer quite easily and enjoyably.  As it warms, there is a good warming sensation with some dry breadiness and more chocolate and raisins mixed with rum.  Though its much more subtle than I make it sound, the alcohol does not jump out at you, but it is there.

Dark skinned sweet fruits rolled around on the tongue, and were backed by a smoky, woody, and herbal hop bitterness.

Medium-heavy body, slick & creamy, lively carbonation.  Nothing cloying here to me.

Theres a pumpernickel aspect to this doppelbock as well.  Hits your palate and kind of spins around your mouth.  Each sip brings a richer and more well-rounded taste.  Now Im hooked.

At a festival that celebrates just one basic beer type, it becomes difficult to find favour or fault with any one beer. Imagine twenty Dutchmen playing the same tune on a variety of trumpets, some play the tune as written, some with a flourish or two.

Aroma is a bit faint of toasty sweet malts and dark fruits lending some plum, raisin, dates, and dried apricot. Taste is a bit more filling, starts a little weak and thin but begins to gain malty weight with a nice toffeeish sweetness and finishes strongly with a nice mixing of dark fruits of plum, raisin, dates, and figs giving way to a little chewy caramel lingering finish which is super smooth and creamy. Nice finish on this. Theres a bit of a metallic twinge in the midway parts but is barely noticeable and appears mostly at the front of the tongue and the lips. Feel is close to medium with a light silken creamyness that floats through the palate with ease and the finish is quite nice with a light building of chewy sweetness.

The remainder of the bottle, though, was full of yeast sediment, and upon pouring it into my glass, a thin white head reappeared.

Kind of syrupy sweet, but its quite clean tasting and there is enough finishing bitterness to keep it drinkable. Brighter aromatically than most of the other common German doppels.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2479,"2002-07-10",3.5,"Rich caramel - toffee - biscuit aroma.  Dark brown with red tinting, large beige head.  Buttery biscuity flavor.  Definitely malt oriented, almost unbalanced but not quite.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

2479,"2002-06-02",3.5,"This doppelbock had hints of belgian-style dubbels and singels.  Odd, really.  However, I quite liked it for its uniqueness.  OK.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
2479,"2002-05-10",4.2,"A Salvator clone, IMHO...but isnt that a good thing?  Buttery malt flavor overwhelms the senses.","Philadelphia, USA","Toiletduck"
2479,"2002-05-01",3.9,"Deep garnet in color, huge biege head and sheets of lace. Nose is caramel, roasted grains, fruity, somewhat sweet. Start is sweet, the top light to medium, the finish is hop spicey, tart, dry, acidic, and is quite robust. The addition of the 7.4 percent ABV, does make it unsuitable for the Palate Challanged Light Beer crowd.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
2479,"2002-04-08",4.4,"Pours with a dark amber, caramel color. Produces a thin beige-colored head of foam. 
Aroma: Sweet; layers of malt, nut, dark fruit and molasses. 
Flavor: lively mouthfeel through having a moderate amount of carbonates; toffee, caramel, plum and raisin flavors threaded by nuts and coffee. Round, silky, lingering finish. Bitterness value: 32.","Pico Rivera, California, USA","maxhits"
2479,"2002-03-25",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 31, 2004 A rich, complex Weizenbock. Deep amber color with a thick white, durable head. Initial nose is that of ripe dark fruit, molases and caramel. Silky smooth palate which is dominated by the malts. Some mild banana esters make their appearance, but palate is one of dark fruit, spice and sweet molasses. Alcohol cuts down the sweetness a bit to prevent it from being cloying. A real classsy brew!!","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"
2479,"2002-03-01",4.1,"Nice weizenbock, sort of like drinking two or three dunkelweizens at once. Almost chocolatey.","Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, USA","Admiral"
2479,"2001-11-26",4.2,"It seems to defy categories; tastes similar to a wheat doppelbock, somewhat sweet, but lager-like.","Fargo, North Dakota, USA","mikenodak"
2479,"2001-11-18",3.1,"Beautiful amber color, nice head.  Sweet malty aroma, no hop aroma detectable, but alcohol present in the nose.  Very wheaty sweet taste that starts sweet and stays sweet.  Decent, but slightly disappointing.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
2479,"2001-11-11",4.4,"Spicy and fruity. Add a 7.4ABV and you have the recipe for a great Doppel! Another great product from Bayer.","USA","Kodos"
2479,"2001-09-22",3.8,"Tastes like 80% bock, 20% wheat.  This is listed as a weizenbock, however the style on this site seems much more appropriate.  Strong roasted caramel and plum aroma, with heavy plums, figs, prunes, and dates flavors and a fruity banana/apple finish.  Develops a scotch-ale character as it warms, making this a unique, albeit slightly underachieving brew from my favorite brewery.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
2479,"2001-09-12",4.3,"This beer has one of the best aroma Ive run across - caramel, toffee, maple and a hint of chocolate. The first sip was almost as complex.  Lots of depth and body.  The 7.4% alcohol punch hides in the spicy finish.","Bowling Green, Kentucky, USA","Brent"
2479,"2001-08-31",3.8,"Behind a slightly acrid nose lies a beautiful, slightly malty beer with hints of fruit and caramel. There was a slight hint of a metallic taste in the first sip, but that quickly dissipated. Left practically no aftertaste, surprisingly for such a strong beer.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
