2272,"2017-06-09",4.0,"330 ml bottle ¬ì2013Vintage¬î bought at HK Brewcraft in Tsim Sha Tsui.
Looks: Clear deep reddish brown colour with a layer of dirt-like yeast sediments; Less than one-quarter finger head with residual soapy light beige foam which fades in 20 seconds; Fair sticky lacing with near zero carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and sweet dark malt, with strong dessert wine, red wine, Bourbon, immense caramel, sticky toffee, strong alcohol, strong plums, strong raisins, sugar, spices, barrels, bread, yeast and light grass. Lovely sweetness!

Taste: Strong sweet dark malt, with strong green grapes, moderate Port wine, red wine, Bourbon, strong alcohol, very strong plums, raisins, strong caramel, toffee, floral, strong molasses, strong spices, fair barrels, light biscuits, lemon, medium bitter hops and grass.

Body: Close to full body. Quite thick and slightly oily palate.

Mouth Feel: Very good dark maltyness - well-attenuated - in a very slick background. Full mouthful of green grapes followed closely by intense dark fruits. Bourbon took a back seat as red wine and port wine factors are much stronger and nicer. Good caramel with surprisingly moderate medioum sweetness with further sips. Spicy and lemony to round. Excellent!

Booze: the 11% abv is upfront and strong, must be treated with respect but is mostly nice comfy red wine smoothness instead of harsh liquor at this level. Sweetness and liquorices are moderate due to high attenuation. Blended well with the Bourbon barrels. Great!

Hoppiness: Spices and light grass in nose. Floral, strong spices, lemon and grass in taste; Bitterness is fairly strong for an abrupt, medium astringent sweet-bitter malty finish.

After Taste: Quite dry. Winey spicy and fairly bitter to mouth.

Comments: This is so different from other rich dark Struise Ales I¬íve had - a strong dark ale base which is lean and mean with hearty dark fruits and caramel characters. The Bourbon barrels landed some unexpected fruity vineyards and red wineyness. Strong comfy booze with just right sweetness. Spicy hops is never far behind. A unorthodox Quad which is nice in its own way. Highly recommended!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

2272,"2017-05-17",3.6,"Bottle at home after insanely nice weather and hanging at the beach this afternoon now still out on the balcony smoking indo sipping on st amatus. I¬ím just writing that down so I can smile and remember whenever I dig this rating up, if ever. Anyway, it¬ís brown, it¬ís dark, it¬ís boozy. Malty af. Caramel, raisans, chestnut, dates, copper, shellac, alcohol, rinse appelstroop, peat. Big sweet and a light, roasty, nutty bitter undertone. Full Malty Jacket and body. Soft carbonation. Thick and slick. There¬ís some good, a lot of OK and some not so good in this beer, especially the finish, or the hook before the softened sweet almost chocolatey aftertaste kicks in. There seems to be some kind of metallic or -what I called shellac before- other weird un-beer-y taste in there. What I do like is the dense syruppy fruity sweetness. That brown leaf, chestnut bitter that follows is ok but it transitions quickly into appelstroop with a growing metallicness, almost medicinal bandaid like taste before I finally get to enjoy a velvety soft deep caramel, rye, bready, almost peaty finish. Yet we all live happily ever after. THE END.","The Hague, NETHERLANDS","sjogro"

2272,"2017-02-16",4.2,"Aroma:

Medium aroma of malts, caramel, wood, whiskey, dried fruit, liquorice, chocolate and roasted malts.

Appearance:

Turbid/opaque red/dark brown beer with heavy yeast and with no/a slight beige head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts heavy sweet with malts, caramel, wood, whiskey, dried fruit, liquorice and chocolate; ends slightly bitter and dry with roasted malts.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. Thanks to that long aging on that bourbon barrel and the rather heavy amount of roasted malts, this almost does not feel like a Belgian beer and even less like a Quad. No matter what style it gets labeled as, this beer is great beyond belief. The aroma could have been stronger and the head could be bigger, though that last one could be forgiven thanks to that aging.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

2272,"2014-10-12",4.4,"One of the many ¬ífake¬í abbey beers in Belgium, with the brewers shown on the label in a kind of medi√´val miniature. Cleary a tribute to Westvleteren 12, from a brewery conveniently situated in Oostvleteren... Thick and stable, light beige head, dark burgundy colour, misty. Powerful and profound malty aroma, toffee, raisins, dates, overripe pear, banana, port wine, liquorice, pipe tobacco, bourbon, figs. Equally profound maltiness in the mouth, soft and velvety, thick mouthfeel, chocolate, candi and caramel abound along with dark fruitiness and spicy yeastiness, with agreeable warming, port-like alcohol in the finish combined with a slightly toasted bitterishness and floral hops. Very complex and a more than excellent example of the ¬ímassieve ale¬í style (here called abt), almost on a par with the biggest representatives of the style - including Westvleteren. World class, if you ask me.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

2272,"2014-10-11",5.0,"La Struise non delude neanche stavolta! Una birra davvero spettacolare. Il colore √® marrone scurissimo, praticamente impenetrabile, con riflessi mogano.

In bocca questi sapori si riconfermano. A farle da padrone √® soprattutto il liquore, un liquore invecchiato e secco. Si ha cos√¨ una birra dolce, con note di marzapane, ma con un finale abbastanza secco, che ricorda il whiskey e la grappa (√® stata infatti invecchiata in botti di Woodford Reserve). Corpo abbastanza strutturato e carbonizzazione abbastanza bassa. I suoi 10,5 gradi non si sentono assolutamente, e la birra non perde mai di qualit√† nel corso della bevuta.

Oak, raisin, and port form its rich but not decadent flavor; the typical flavors of the style are present and appropriately balanced, if maybe it tilts toward a regal booziness sometimes.  The mid palate and finish are rather timid.

Je suis seulement sid√©r√© que apr√®s 457 rates, on me laisse la possibilit√© de donner √† ce miracle
son premier 5¬†!!!!
Mon exemplaire est un vintage 2011. Il a donc 3 belles ann√©es de m√ªrissement suppl√©mentaire.
Elle a subi par le brasseur un m√ªrissement en f√ªt de whisky.
Couleur marron fonc√© superbe, rousse en transparence.
Clart√© nette. Bulles tr√®s fines par milliers partout.
Mousse beige fonc√© qui va napper constamment le breuvage d¬íune belle cr√®me fine.
Ar√¥mes de fruits m√ªrs, malt fonc√©, levure, pointe d¬í√©pices et f√ªt de whisky.
1√®re bouche √† la texture soyeuse, velout√©e, lisse, sur un beau volume de c√©r√©ales avec une pointe
de caf√© moka. Arri√®re-bouche superbe sur des notes d¬íirish coffee.
2√®me bouche qui insiste sur le caf√©, mais avec une grande noblesse.
3√®me bouche sur le pain complet, pointe de tabac noir, tourbe, f√ªt whisky de grande classe.
Arri√®re-bouche longue, complexe et tr√®s suave.
La longueur commence sur les fruits m√ªrs, retrouve du tabac de la Semois, avec un peu de 
cannelle et une √©pice finement muscad√©e.
La levure est de classe mondiale, sublime.
L¬íalcool que le brasseur a fix√© √† 10,5 % abv, a encore pris un peu de bonus avec l¬í√¢ge, et fait
un travail exceptionnel de soutien au go√ªt.
La finale est divine, aussi bien dans sa texture que ses saveurs.
CONCLUSION¬†: incroyable premier 5 d¬íune bi√®re qui en m√©rite 10, 100 et davantage.
Pour moi, elle est incontestablement au-dessus du lot, et doit atteindre environ 555 sur 100.
Immense bi√®re qui a un historique profond chez les Struise, qui est un brassin superbe et en plus
m√ªri en f√ªt de whisky. Que demande le connaisseur¬†? Exactement cela, et tous les jours bien

Secondary review; blind test with other top rated quads.

Blind quad test against Pannepot, Pannepeut, Rochefort 10, St Bernardus 12,Westvleteren 12, The Sixth Glass, & Chimay Blue My prefered order was; Pannepot, Rochefort 10, St Amatus 12, Westvleteren 12, St Bernardus, Pannepeut, Sixth Glass and last Chimay.

This is actually a lot like westvleteren, but sweeter and a bit vinous note, it is also a lot better carbonated than westvleteren, and has a sprucy refreshing taste which gives it a great drinkability, more hops, more oak, a bit less dark fruit, but for me, still more interesting.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","simont1"

A: Pours a hazelnut/graham ale with superb clarity. Orange hues with passing light on the borders. Single finger of tan foam falls to a sheet of the same. Spotty lacing.

S: Sweet, nougat, vanilla, bing cherry, almonds and amaretto. A bit of alcohol. Some nice notes of wood and maybe some cinnamon.

T: Caramel, a bit oxidized (in the right way), nougat, raw almonds, milky chocolate, cherries and oaky. Toasty and really nice.

S: The nose is full of dark stone fruits, caramel, toffee, molasses, and really dense and hearty bread. An excellent spice note to the beer, enhancing the bread qualities, as does the yeatiness.

T: The bread dominates the flavor, with a mild sweetness of plums and figs, and maybe some dark cherries complimenting it. An almost hunger satisfying flavor, I must say.

M: The body is full with a great level of rolling, creamy carbonation that you seem to only find in quads.

Sweet on the palate, sweet malts, dark over-ripened fruits bombard the taste buds, perhaps dried prunes, dates, figs and sultanas with some background spice. Sweet caramel/toffee and a little tobacco and wood.

Consumed alongside Pannepot Grand Reserva 2005.

The beer appears a dark brown shade (darker than the Pannepot) with a fleeting, light tan head. A minimal amount of lacing is left behind. The aroma is wonderful, and obviously of an authentic Belgian quad. I detect yeast, bread, subtle dark fruits, and slight alcohol. The taste is great, and surprisingly smooth, especially given that this beer is newly released, thus quite young. The finish contains a slight warming note with only a faint trace of alcohol. The 10.5% abv is hidden quite well. What a delicious beer. This is practically as smooth as the 2005 Pannepot. I am amazed that this beer drinks this well already. A true masterpiece. De Struise Brouwers proves yet again that it is one of the finest breweries around. Urbain is making some of the finest Belgian Belgian beer in the world.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

This elegant Quadrupel proposes clove phenols, bubblegum esters, raisin-y malts and licorice sweetness in a lean and leveled flavor profile.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the brownish mahogany haze.
-Light alcohol heat appears in the back, mostly in the form of brown rum when tagging along the residual sugars
-Banana esters add to the yeast¬ís prolific performance.
-I¬íd like to try this next to a Rochefort 10 one day.

St. Amatus 12 has a fairly transparent cherry dark brown color with a thick sea foam tan cap. Nice retention and some spots of lace sticking to the glass. 

The aroma is sweet and actually a little tart. A bit of molasses and caramel, but mostly brown sugar sweetness. Some lightly roasted malt. Sweet and tart cherry go along with some fig and raisin to add fruit and depth.

The taste is quite sweet up front, but the sweetness doesn¬ít linger. Brown sugar is the main flavor, with a touch of molasses and some caramel from the malt. Nice dark fruits - figs and raisins mostly, and some cherry as well. Nutmeg, cinnamon, and a bit of all spice are a delicate addition. A touch of tart cherry toward the end. There is a light alcohol flavor throughout, but I am only slightly aware of it, and it does not detract from the flavor at all. 

This is full bodied, but a bit lighter than I remember for most quads. The carbonation is light, preferring to stay out of the way, but it is a bit soft. Although there are sweet flavors, it does not have much residual stickiness.

Relativt tydelig alkohol og ret lang bitter eftersmag, men en god s√∏dme der udbalancerer, s√• den ikke bliver for voldsom. Et let strejf af vanille. Mere kompleks end som s√•, hvilket jeg ikke har givet udtryk for i min f√∏rste vurdering af dette bryg. Stadig tyk og fyldig i munden, og med nedtonet m√¶ngde af kulsyre. Den er en anelse for alkoholisk til at ramme en 8¬íer i smag, hvilket ogs√• g√∏r, at den lander p√• 15 i stedet for 16/20 i overall.","Nysted, DENMARK","flemmingwillum"

By midway an amazing chocolate note rises to the surface and takes this into wonderful places just as you noticed the formidable ABV.

Dark brown colour with huge head. The aroma is rich, yet undeveloped. The beer was bottled pretty recently so it¬ís still too young to be scrutinized I suppose. Bit lactic and one-dimensional in aroma. Higher alcohols, there are sugars up front, followed by suggestions of dark berries along with almond paste. Very light on the phenols.  Flavourwise, we have heavy sweet malt, un-ripe berries and sweet malt. Chocolate lurks underneath, as does lactic acid. Suggestions of caramel, but just vaguely so. Light on the phenols here as well.  It feels like this unclear mish-mash of flavours will develop in a few years time.  Medium-big body. This is definitely a beer that needs a few years to develop.

A surprising very light tan head rises about five full fingers with really good retention, and fantastic lacing...The aroma is nice, has the normal quad notes of dark fruits, molasses and candied sugar, but his is the sweeter side of most trappist quads, and WAY WAY sweeter than Pannepot. No initial alcohol burn on a new beer that is come from a Pannepot either...The taste carries over the sweetness, and I¬ím replaying my notes above but this is a SUPER sweet quad, just hanging on the cliff by a fingernail from being too sweet. Tons of prunes on the front with light candied sugar, with a bit of hops on the back. The finish is slightly alcoholic and a little boring...The feel is on the lighter side but decent enough...Super easy to drink because of the sweetness.

2272,"2010-11-13",3.5,"Transcription of an old BA review from 06-15-2010, with scores adjusted to RB scale. Will re-rate.

Vintage 2010, into St. Bernardus goblet. Pours dark caramel-brown hazy body topped by moderate creamy head that sets down to a stable veil. Swirling coats the glass with a delicate, short-lived lacework quickly broken into tiny patches sliding down the walls.
The initial fruity aroma of figs and raisins is quickly blown away by clean spicy alcohol - which is quite disturbing and adds negatively to the overall impression; red wine and unrefined sugar. The flavor is malty, with fruity tartness , red wine, spicy yeast and alcohol. The low carbonated body is creamy with smooth transitions between the nicely mellowed flavors.
A nice tribute to trappist quads but the evident alcohol presence sets a gap between the genuine trappists and Struise¬ís attempt of mimicking the monk¬ís work. However, the beer is still young and the remaining bottles might significantly improve with aging.","SLOVENIA","EvilBuddha"

2272,"2010-08-28",4.0,"Sampled at Het Oude Schooltje; July 2010,br>
The beer pours with an amber tinged, dark tan colored head that sits on top of a dark, burnt amber hued beer.  When held up to the light the beer shows a brilliantly clear, red / ruby / brown hue.  This has a nice candi-sugar influenced nose to it, with notes of dark fruit (prune and raisin being definitely noticeable) and there is an earthy spice character to it as well as some sweet spice (like Christmas) aromas here.  I can pick out notes of clove, ginger, and a hint of pepper, but there is quite a bit going on here.

The beer tastes quite sweet as it hits the palate, but much of this comes from the base fruitiness and the sweet accentuating spiciness that is found in this beer.  The finish is dry with a spicy note as well as a touch of astringency.  The fruit flavors found here remind me of bright plums, tart-sweet raisins and even some fig notes add to the complexity.  Flavors of rum, or perhaps more properly characterized as brandy flavors are brought out by the sweetness, the fruit character and the alcohol.  This is really quite nicely balanced between the fruit character, the alcohol, the earthy spiciness and the candi sugar flavors.  This has the proper character needed of being light and quaffable for its strength; it is still most definitely a sipping beer, but it is not overly heavy or cloying.  The sipping also allows one to fully experience the complexity and myriad of balanced flavors.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Could use just some more carbonation, a little to less for me, but doable. And maybe just a bit less sweetness. Good lightly bitter aftertaste with red fruits inside. I like it for sure.

Draught at Pre ZBF and then again at Struise School a few days afterwards.Murky brown colour with a thin tan head, in all honesty, it¬ís not the most attractive looking Struise beer. Once it hits the other senses however it all comes much more together. Amazing oaky chocolate and preserve fruit. Big alcohol but in a really enjoyable way. Stunningly smooth though. The fruit and caramel intermingle so well, as do the spice and bitterness. Considerably better at the school once it had time to settle down a little. It just seemed a little too early at the festival. The scores are a combination of the two times I¬íve tried it but I would thoroughly expect them to jump up a little once I¬íve had a chance to try the bottled version.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
