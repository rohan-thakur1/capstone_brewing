Clean fruitiness in the mouth but rich in mango, green banana and even slight apple, strongish minerally carbonation, numbing a bit the smooth, full, biscuity and cereally maltiness, well-rounded with only subtle hints of velvety oats, soapy wheat and spicy rye - in fact overpowered by the wealth of aromatic, DIPA-like hoppiness, grapefruit peel- and green pepper-like, providing a long, drying bitterness; some warming alcohol in the very end.

Mouthfeel is soapy and thick. Palate is full-bodied with nice toasted malty flavors of barley bread, graham cracker and honey. Hops are spicy with cilatro, parsley, with bitter and mint, I immediately get hyssop on my mind. The hops are just about right considering that the sweet malty, syrupy palate just wont go away.

4.0 D: Really nice beer. I can see why so many enjoy it.

The initial nose triggered ""barley wine"" thoughts, the appearance that of a slightly hazy Stone-ish IPA, with lots of rising carbonation bubbles.

2679,"2014-11-05",4.1,"(350ml bottle from Systembolaget) Pours a very slightly hazed pale golden orange with a short lived white head that fades to a ring quickly with a little lace. Aroma is nice and vibrant, with pink grapefruit, hints of candied orange, some red berries, light tropical notes, and a lightly spicy, herbal undertone that could be rye as well as hops. Otherwise malts are restrained in the nose. On the palate, sweetish initially with orange, grapefruit, strawberry, and a lot of earthy, spicy herbal/floral hop characters. In the middle, its half sweet, half bitter with the hop character still dominant. Towards the finish, the characters of the grain bill come into focus, with a peppery rye note and a creaminess from oats, alongside a moderate resinous bitterness and lingering citrus/tropical notes. The feel at the finish is smooth and rounded with that oat character. Mouthfeel is medium-full otherwise, and the carb quite soft. Perhaps that mouthfeel is the beers biggest strength, and the best contribution of the complex grain bill. Alongside is a nice, fruity/spicy hop profile that matches it, making for a very balanced and drinkable DIPA.

The hops throughout are snappy and sweet, close to tropical overkill, especially in concert with so much sugar. Good drinkability at this alcohol level. Though it leans heavy at times, it always stays punchy; the finish however is syrupy, candy fruit, sticky smack.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Medium to full bodied mouthfeel. Pretty decent on the whole but hard to grasp what its trying to be. Seems maltier than a DIPA but not malty enough to be an American barleywine. Enjoyable though.","Cheshire, ENGLAND","Nocturne"
2679,"2014-08-27",4.4,"Transfer from BA review on 2-13-13-
 Served on tap in a pint glass

 Appearance  Served a golden amber color with a one finger white head. The head slowly fades over time to give a light level of lacing.

 Smell  The aroma is a nice mix of citrus hop and tropical fruit. The tropical fruit is a nice mix of pineapple, mango and tangerine with the hop being mainly of a grapefruit aroma mixed with a hint of pine hop.

 Taste  The taste begins with a nice bready and tropical fruit flavor of mango and papaya and some tangerine mixed within. With these flavors is a lighter caramel flavor which grows stronger more toward the middle and end of the taste. Also as the flavor advances, some hop flavors, mainly of a grapefruit nature, come to the tongue. While the hop flavors grow stronger in nature as the taste advances further, they never really drown out the sweeter and malty flavors as they seem to keep pace with the hop. In the end, a sweeter and malty hopped taste is left on the tongue. It is very balanced and very nice.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. The thicker body helps the hop flavors stand out and is great for the bready body of the beer with the lower carbonation accentuating these flavors and helping to create a very soothing mouthfeel. 

 Overall  This is a fantastic, slightly sweeter but very balanced IPA. A great drinking brew and one I will certainly seek out more often.","","Darkmagus82"

A - 5 - The beer is a nice golden amber color with a thick white frothy head. Leaves a nice lumpy lacing on the glass.
S - 9 - Super fresh grapefruit, orange, lemon zest, pineapple, pine. Maybe some bready malt in there but the hops are so forward they pretty much cover it up.
T - 9 - Tastes like a bag of whole hops smells. Super piney, fresh, grapefruit, mango, pineapple, citrus zest. Balanced by nice sweet malt backbone.
M - 5 - The bitterness lingers on the back of your tongue, begging you to drink more. Alc covered, aftertaste is graprfruit/piney hops. Carbonation perfect.
O - 18/20 - tomorrows plan, buy another six pack of this.

2679,"2014-03-29",3.4,"I know Ive had this at a bar; this time Im reviewing it at home. The aroma is hoppy (I was expecting that from Lagunitas), grassy with a ton of grapefruit and pine. Looks like most mainstream beers, only a little darker and with a longer lasting stickier head. Nothing extraordinary about the aroma or appearance. Tastes slightly sweet, pale malt first, then the trademark bitter hops that I knew were coming. The bitter taste is very short, then the sweetness comes back to combine with the hops. Very distinct and balanced taste. Palate is fairly oily, and the carbonation is just right. I would drink this again; its not too hard to find and reasonably priced. Plus, you can get a six-pack, you dont have to buy bombers. If youve never had it, you should drink it. Not 100, but pretty good.","Missouri, USA","coachd"
2679,"2014-03-25",4.9,"Bottled January 4th. Poured January 29th into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint.

Appearance: A sunset orange sort of color. Very slight haze. Fantastic white, foamy head floating on top leaving tons of lacing. One hell of a sexy looking brew.

Smell: $#@&, thats GOOD. Trademark Lagunitas tea-like aroma (well, I think it smells like tea... reminds me of it...), with a wallop of grapefruit and maybe some pineapple as well. Really tropical. A nice, sweet, bright-as-all-hell, fresh picked hops. It smells phenomenal, to say the least. Nearly perfect.

Taste/feel: Again with that trademark reminds-me-of-tea Lagunitas flavor. That with the unbelievable blend of all the tropical fruit flavors you can think of (...not durian. Thats tropical, right?), a hint of grass, resinous hops, and the absolute slightest alcohol warmth... this is... really almost unreal. I was worried that Sucks would be a bit too sweet, and it starts off that way, but then theres a perfect amount of bitterness on the back of the tongue on the finish that is unbelievable. The mouthfeel is medium in texture and carbonation. The carbonation really helps to ""pop"" the taste buds, and it works extremely well in this brew.

Well, ladies and gentlemen, here we have probably the best beer Ive ever tasted. It pours beautifully, the smell is glorious, and the taste is a religious experience. Ive tried to think of reasons not to give this beer my first perfect rating in taste and overall rating, but I cant think of one -- this is a double IPA that every single person needs to try. The sweet, tropical, tea flavors on the front, the incredible amount of bittering hops on the finish... Sucks is every bit as good as what the majority says it is. Im kicking myself for only getting a single bottle. Lagunitas must make this year-round.

Im a Michigan boy, so it pains me to say this, but... this is a better brew than Bells Hopslam. I only had Hopslam this year once (on-tap), and it was GOOD, but it was harsher than I remember it being. I know this is 2% lower than Hopslam, but I really couldnt give a shit.

2679,"2014-02-24",4.1,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Dogfish Head pint glass.

The color is a clear orange/gold with a finger or so of foamy white head and some thick lacing left on the glass.

The smell is hops with a backup of sweet malt aroma that sits towards the back but can not be ignored. There is a candy-like aroma there that has a touch of grape Fundip.

The taste is less hoppy then expected, the malt is there first with some sweetness to start things off before going quickly into some flavorful fruity hop bitterness. This beer may have some age on it so its a little drawn back from what I remember from having a fresh one in the past. This still holds up and in some ways is more flavorful with the bitterness in the back seat and more of fruit flavor is detectable without being over shadowed.

Also a strange, almost minty taste that I can't quit put my finger on. Possibly some alcohol coming through. A dry medium mouthfeel.

Thusly, a clear pour is amber-gold and produces a small white head that fizzles away to light cover, quickly.Damn. The nose does smell really nicely hoppy and balanced. Juicy fruits, very light orange rind and pine on the end, and just a bit of pale malt sweetness. Clean, no esters, alcohol or vapors. Just fresh hops and malt.Orangey hop flavor washes over the palate as a soft but rich honeyed-sweetness balances. The carbonation is stiff and too peppery, disrupting the continuity at first. Very bitter throughout and ending with Heavy pine bitterness. It quickly builds up and soon Im not reaching for my glass quickly any more. At 8%, thats fine and this is a good sipper. Its clean, with alcohol warming and pine resin to the max, but very well-done production-wise (aside from the fact that I still wont concede to filtering being good).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2679,"2014-02-06",4.0,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance is a light orange/yellow colored yet somewhat hazy body, foamy white head appears and dies to a film coating the top of the beer. Some nice rings are left sticking to the sides of the chalice.
The smell is an abundance of grapefruit up front backed up nicely by some light lime, lemon and pine. It comes across very strong as the beer sits on my coaster less than a foot away from my nose and I can still smell it. Some other hops are there but not as intrusive as the grapefruit ones. The malts are there slightly.
The taste is bitter and eventually gets slightly sweet as the beer warms. The grapefruit is tasted all the way down.
The palate is about a medium but doesnt come across that sessionable with a sticky aftertaste, and gets slightly syrupy and the finish is dry, The ABV is hidden well.
Overall, this is probably the most forward grapefruit DIPA Ive ever had, no worries, I liked it a lot and cant wait to see this next year.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

2679,"2014-01-28",3.9,"Bottled December 16, 2014.
Appearance: The body is crystal clear, showing off lazy and wide spread carbonation bubbles in the golden to light amber hued body. The head is short and soft looking, forming a dense white head.
Aroma: The aroma is heavy on citrus, lots of orange and apricot along with a hint of pineapple. The aroma isnt overly strong, but its not shy either.
Taste: This is a very nice flavorful and enjoyable IPA. Lots of citrus, like the aroma, with a lingering pineapple. The malt base is firm providing a mild sweetness to balance the beer out. The finish has a strong bitterness that almost comes off as astringent, grapefruit like.
Palate: Full-bodied and moderately carbonated.
Overall: This is a very enjoyable IPA, it reminds me a lot of Victorys Hop Ranch actually. This is a bit of a better value though and perhaps a bit better balanced. This is a must try for every hop head!","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

2679,"2014-01-26",4.4,"I dont think this is what the Lagunitas marketing experts had in mind, but I have looked at this brew in various coolers for several years, and getting past the Lagunitas Sucks label, I was still deterred by the Brown Sugar Substitute. I dont generally like my beer brown or sugary.

Well, my mistake for not trying it sooner. What a remarkable brew, and still in the Lagunitas style of full bodied and flavorful ales. Mentioned before that my sense of smell is not the greatest, but opening a bottle of this, I was knocked over by the fruity aroma... like a glass of fruit punch! Naturally enough, this carries over into the flavor which is nicely balanced and covers the high ABV kick. Damn great brew!","Massachusetts, USA","migwell"

Healthy amount of just off-white head that held pretty well, and faded into a medium-thin collar and a thin head that held until the glass emptied. Lacing is spotty, but pretty good. Aroma is a really interesting dance between pine and citrus hops with a nice supporting cast of a medium malt base. Though, the more I sniff, the more I pick up on the citrus over the pine. Taste is surprisingly malt centered. I get some tropical hops character in the front, that moves into more of the grapefruit, then some pine, then back to citrus; all being held up by this really great malt sweetness.

After reading this thread: http://www.ratebeer.com/forums/sucks-vs-celebratio and recently trying SN celebration head-to-head with the very similar Ballast Point Big Eye PA, I was eager to do the head-to-head between Lagunitas sucks and celebration. I will freely admit that I came into this one with a huge bias: the arrival of celebration on the shelves has been an annual event for a decade now, whereas most of what Ive had from Lagunitas, well, sucks. So even though I freely concede that this years celebration is not the best, I expected it to take an easy victory over sucks. 
I poured the two beers out side by side into twin Duvel tulips. The first surprise is that the celebration is the darker, orangier of the two ales --- surprising given that I associate Lagunitas with crystal malt bombs. The real surprise, though, comes in the aroma. The Lagunitas has a big juicy grapefruit and mandarin orange peel thing going on, terrific aroma. The celebration, meanwhile, smells of canned corn and stewed vegetables, and barely that. Not a good year for aroma at all. This is a 6/10, giving an easy win for sucks that deserves an 8. Despite the huge difference in aroma, the quite different flavors of these two beers score relatively close to one another, a high 6 for lagunitas and a low 7 for celebration with the edge going to celebration because of its trademark pine-needle close. The lagunitas, while juicier, is also quite a bit sweeter, with a sort of confectionary-sugar-added taste. This is not a good thing, though I admit that when paired with various too-sweet chocolate christmas cookies, this was not so notable as a flaw. For mouthfeel, lagunitas should be able to take the day with its higher abv base, and does so, with a nice full syrupy mouthfeel that carries almost no heat. 

Final scores on this tasting are celebration 6/3/7/3/15=3.4, sucks 8/3/6/4/14=3.5, but the lagunitas victory on points is a bit misleading. While overall I greatly prefer smelling the lagunitas, Isomewhat prefer the celebration for actually drinking. A substantial part of that is that the long end of the finish for celebration is really pleasant, whereas the long finish of sucks is sort of sickly sweet with bitter resins underneath. A fun comparison, and perhaps worth trying again some year when celebration puts up a stronger showing. My overall lifetime experience with Celebration has been much more positive, meriting a 4.something, and Ill bump that down only a tenth or so unless they have another bad year in 2014.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

2679,"2013-12-27",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 12, 2014 Lagunitas is one of the best, bargain top shelf breweries out there. However, most of their stuff, while very good, is not really top tier stuff. There are a few exceptions however. Their Hop Stoopid, 100ibu, Imperial IPA, is really excellent, and simply impossible to beat for the price.

And then theres this years Lagunitas Sucks. Its, put simply, the best beer Lagunitas has made, even including previous iterations of Sucks. It has some of that dank, oniony character that has become a staple in Stones Enjoy-By series. Pouts a gorgeous amber, aroma is vibrant with onion, pine and grapefruit. Taste is sweet, lots of pine, dry aftertaste. Its superlatively balanced, and tastes huge for a 7.5%.

2679,"2013-12-18",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2014 12 oz. bottle from trade. No date but should be fresh since I got it today. Pours a deep clear golden orange with a small white head.

Retrying this with a bottle I know is fresh. Pours golden and clear with a giant fluffy white head. Off the bat there is significantly more cat pee, pine, lemon peel, and huge florals than last time.

Otherwise, there are ample hop flavors: resin in the smell and early palate, with passion fruits and mango coming through strongly in the middle and late palate.  Nice stuff.  Wasnt a fan when smelling it, but man did it get better in the taste.","San Diego, California, USA","gorditoabd"

2679,"2013-03-21",4.1,"Pours a dark golden color with a thicker white head which laces well.  The aroma......overwhelming citrus and most definitely grapefruit is the most dominant aroma with slight piney notes being drowned out.  Taste is grapefruit, then grapefruit, then a touch of malt and very slight bitterness, and the grapefruit lingers with a thick mouthfeel on the palette.  Though very citrusy it does not have that normal sour bitterness in the aftertaste.  Over the top but put together well.","Pennsylvania, USA","Voodoo"

2679,"2013-03-20",4.9,"Aroma: piney goodness, bright hop smell, citrus - hard time picking up malts over all the orange citrus/hop smell. Maybe some dry hay malt.

Taste: bitter hops up front, balances out midpalate, sweet citrus finish, and it all beatifully lingers together once its down.
Palate: long finish - and I mean that as a good thing. Light body (tingly carbonation), oily sticky texture
Overall: this is one of my favorite beers. I was initially worried that it was going to be a one time thing - literally just a Brown Sugga substitute for one year, and I was ready to throw myself off a bridge accordingly. I couldnt live in a world where I knew this once existed, only for it to be no longer. Dramatic? Yes. True? Yes.","West Sacramento, USA","shellym810"

2679,"2013-03-18",4.1,"Tasted from a 12oz brown bottle into tulip pint glass, thanks gregwilsonstl! It poured a clear, orangish amber colour with fast upward streams of bubbles, HUGE, everlasting sudsy off-white foam which, after many slow pours you finally manage to fill the glass and perhaps hours or days later (thats what it felt like, okay?!) you drink it down to the point where you see all the beautiful Belgian lace glued to the sides, too. It looked like a fuck!ng magic bubble bath which never dissipates. Aroma was profoundly strong citrusy/resiny American hops and not much else. I was prepared for this to be just another grapefruit bomb, but I was wrong. Thankfully, the flavours were much more complex than the aroma. Still extremely hops-forward, obviously, but I tasted layers of English marmalade, dried apricots, cranberries, mamosas, lemoncello...I could go on...but then held in balance by a crisp, firm, husky grainbill which reads like a Belgian farmhouse ale. Peppery, earthy, woodsy...getchasome! Light body, moderate carbonation, with a well-rounded mouthfeel, and harmonious hoppy tang that just wouldnt go away. Smooth not harsh, with high alcohol content completely hidden as well. Man, oh man, I gotta hand it to Lagunitas, this is another ridiculously well-crafted beer. Im not even a big fan of IPAs, but this is like a hop-bursted Saison, which I can most certainly get behind. Cheers!","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"

The best part, though, is that its not that cloying, bitter, over-hopped disaster that so many craft breweries are doing these days. Its just a smooth, delicious hop flavor.

If Lagunitas hasnt already, they should give this beer a permanent name and make it a fixture in the year-round lineup.  This guy is right up there with the Maximus, as well as some of the other best IPAs in the land.  The beer pours a fairly light gold color with a voluptuous white head.  The head leaves a ton of sticky lace around the edge of the glass.  The nose is bright, pungent and spicy, with notes of wood, grapefruit, tangerine, orange and grapes.  The body is full and silky smooth.  This beer is absoutely delicious!  I cannot drink enough of this.  Before I knew it, three bottles were gone.  The flavors are seriously dry and spicy, but with a ton of tropical fruit notes.  This IPA has the balance of a champion.

2679,"2013-02-23",4.2,"From a 12 oz bottle. Could not determine when brewed. Purchased from HEB here in The Woodlands. Cracked it open into a Mad Elf snifter. Lots of carbonation with about an inch of head that calmed down eventually. Tons of floral bouquet and grapefruit mango notes.  Aroma wise on par with the best. As some have said before the taste doesnt live up to the aroma. As with a lot of Lagunitas beers, its really sweet and syrupy, almost like a barley wine. Good hop hit on the tongue. Decent carbonation. Abv not too high. Texas doesnt get a lot of good beers so I compare all my IPAs to Ballast Point Sculpin which I can get and Sucks is not quite there. If Sculpin is a 5.0 this is a decent 4.2. Also about $4 less a sixer than Sculpin. L Sucks runs about $10 here in Texas. Get it if you see it but I wouldnt go on a manhunt for it.","","jpwooten"
2679,"2013-02-23",3.4,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle.  The pour is a slightly hazy medium amber with a moderate off-white head that settles down.  The aroma is quite nice and generally my favorite aspect of this beer.  There is an unusual earthy, piney hop note on the nose with a slight brown sugar note. The body is medium and acidic. The taste starts out sweet but the hoppy character takes over quickly.  Not much in the way of lingering hops.  Decent enough but I think the hype is a bit off.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"

2679,"2013-02-20",2.7,"Bottle.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly lasting.
Body is dark yellow.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), moderately to heavily hoppy (grapefruit, resin), with notes of soap, sugar syrup, and celery.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, velvety/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

Basically grapefruit juice with some floor wax, a few minor off notes, and a sour flavor balance (as if grapefruit juice was actually added).  It doesnt suck or rock, its just a boring, average, one-dimensional grapefruit-heavy IPA.

Smell - I decanted the beer and was immediately hit by a powerful smell of hops ... This is no typical ""winter ale"". Instead, the aroma clearly indicates IPA or DIPA; and that,, of course, is what we have. Even so, the high level of pine-tinged, citrusy hop aroma is striking, and a bit formidable. but do not fear, the taste is largely tamed by the substantial multi-grain malt load.  The rich and complex flavor really is both bitter and sweet; it does lack the bite or the challenging bitterness one might expect to find in an Ameri. IPA, particularly one with this level of hop aroma.  Clearly, Lagunitas did a great job of selecting the quantity and variety of malts to go with the hops. And there are no dank or off tastes despite some earthiness in the aromatics. Higher ABV is well hidden.  Very good (Medium-light) carbonation; medium body.

Overall - superb DIPA. Powerful yet very pleasant and easy to drink. Excellent aftertaste. Well worth seeking out. Ive had the very good Brown Shugga this replaced and, as good as that is, this is better ... no apologies (even tongue in cheek) needed, Lagunitas!","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"

A very juicy tropical fruit character on the taste that carries for a very long time. Tons of tangerine, mango, orange, and pineapple all backed up by a little bit of alcohol and bread. Bitterness is fairly mild for a double IPA and is just enough to balance out the sweetness. Mouthfeel is really perfect without any of the residual sugar all too often found in this style.

Aroma pineapple, pine, tropical fruit, bread, caramel.  Flavor has less of the tropical fruit than I expected and exhibits more pine and bread as is more typical of the style (and, sorry Ratebeer, but this is an IPA, not an American strong), but there is definitely a pineapple vibe throughout; piney bitter finish is really well balanced, as 60+ IBUs is nothing to scoff at but its certainly not out of place in here.  Medium body, frothy carbonation, barely sticky.  Ill take Brown Shugga over this any day but thats just personal preference, I suppose.

A: Straw coloration drifting into orange. Clear with a good refraction through the glass. Fluffy almost white head. Aces. 

N: Fever for the hops. Pine and earth are dominant with the pineapple and mango playing back up. Its a deep full scent with that cracking, sweet nature I always attribute to a well done dry hopping. A deeper inhalation yields some clementine and passionfruit.

T: A taste that can only be referred to as dank. (Need to jazz that description up a bit.) Pine needles and evergreen forest floors. Bites and stings with lupulins. (Lupulins are sedatives. I will sleep well tonight.) Needs more citrus, though. 

M: Scraping and filling. Alcohols second string.

O: This beer makes me verbose and lyrical. (Or pretentious? I dont think Lagunitas has that aim, though.) This is an all star beer that I buy every time it comes out, which, now shouldnt be a problem with the expansion in place. Lagunitas sucks, indeed.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

2679,"2013-01-02",4.2,"12 ounce bottle purchased from the Davis Beer Shoppe.  2012/13 Vintage.  The aroma on this is hoppy as hell, with significant mango, grapefruit, orange, and other citrus goodies.  A bit reminiscent of a fresh Sculpin.  Light dank.  Super hoppy, and super aromatic.  Mildly hazy orange-colored body with a medium, creamy off-yellow head.  Good retention.  Starts with some significant danky and citrus hop flavors.  More mango in this comes through in the middle.  The malts are lightly sweet, but there enough to balance the hops out.  I definitely do not detect any rye, oats, or wheat here.  They must be used in pretty small portions.  Finishes with more citrus hoppiness (huge mango!), and a moderate hop bitterness.

Wow, the taste follows suit. Utterly delicious. By far the best beer I have had from Lagunitas. A bit sweet from the onset - my only minor complaint about this beer. Alcohol and malt are afterthoughts. This beer is a showcase for hops.

A steady pour produces a two-finger thick, pale tan colored head that leaves lots of layered lacing on the sides of my New Belgium Globe glass. The beer is a nice copper color that shows a brilliantly clear, bright copper-gold hue when held up to the light. The nose smells vibrantly hoppy with huge notes of lychee, perhaps a touch of guava, big kumquat zest aromatics, bright super ripe tangelo, as well as a much softer, but still quite present backdrop of pine, dankly herbaceous notes, and perhaps a touch of woody notes. This is the type of IPA I could just sit and smell forever.

Bitingly, bracingly, expressively bitter from the beginning through the end of my first sip; there is also a huge hop fruit character that is a mix of tangelo and kumquat zest, as well as a huge lychee character and hugely floral, tropical fruit notes. The biting bitterness is accentuated by a noticeable, though supporting herbal hop character that suggests of menthol, dank hemp oil, and pine. The fruitiness in the hops really accentuates a soft sweetness in this otherwise fairly dry beer; the finish is especially dry and clean, this drinks quite light and quaffable, though it does have enough of a body to stand up to the hop onslaught. There is a fair amount of prickly carbonation, perhaps a hint too much even. The malt character is barely noticeable, but does suggest at notes of crackers and perhaps a touch of English biscuit character in the finish.

I am quite happy that this beer is still hugely hoppy. I had a chance to taste this fresh this past winter, but never got around to procuring some bottles for a proper review: the aroma of this is still incredible, and is exactly what I like in an expressive IPA (Fruit focused with a solid herbaceous backdrop to balance things out). The flavor also does not disappoint and is much the same as the aroma. A beer for the hop head; I am thoroughly enjoying this. This still taste ridiculously fresh, though it has likely been stored cold since being released.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2679,"2012-03-15",3.8,"From notes.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip.

The pour is a mostly transparent, full golden yellow color with straw edges.  A regal off white froth bellows up from the beer upon pouring.  Levels of lace remain where the beer rested during my glass.  

The biggest compliment I can pay to the complexity of this beer is that it seems nearly impossible to identify all of the aromas and flavors, so I am reduced to using general descriptors to do the best I can.  The aroma has a spicy pine hop base, with a nice amount of grapefruit, apricot, and tangerine as well.  As the sweetness comes through, I get some light pale malts, honey, and some caramel.  

The flavor blend nicely together and roll in complexity.  Up front, biscuity bread and honey, some light caramel notes, and then a nice wave of hops that never goes off the bitter end.  Spicy pine, grapefruit, lemon zest, apricot, and assorted other citrus notes roll on the tongue as the sip concludes.

The hops are strong, but not totally overwhelming.  The oil residue mostly clears away from the mouth after each sip, and the hoppy flavor and crisp carbonation mean it scrubs the tongue clean after sip.  The overall feel is simple, clean, crisp, and refreshing.

MASSIVE peachy hop aroma, pineapple, tangerine, bubblegum, with mild hints of leather. This aroma is epic! Roapy lacing is so very sticky. Taste is so intense, big hop bomb with a leathery malt balance. Pineapple, tangerine, lemon hard candy in the finish. The bitter sneaks up on you, you never really notice it but after a while it builds up and lingers for ever.

2679,"2012-02-16",4.7,"I appreciate breweries with a sense of humor, whether subtle or obvious and in the case of Lagunitas Sucks Holiday Ale its clear they were going for irony of Orwellian proportions. It most definitely does not suck, in fact its close to absolute perfection. A beer with amazing, delicious taste, smooth drinkability and is very versatile. The only thing that sucks about this beer is that its not a year-round offering.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Bright orange color with only slight haze; some carbonation bubbles visible. Forms a large, bright white, frothy head which retains and laces beautifully.

Smell: Magnificent bouquet of fleshy tropical fruits (i.e. mango, papaya, guava, passion fruit); noticeable sweet candy-like aroma too plus organic flowers. Extremely inviting.

Taste: Sometimes you know a beer is great when you drink it quickly because you enjoy it so much. I drank Lagunitas Sucks Holiday Ale in about five minutes because it was so delectable. The palate matches the nose perfectly: a strong, delightful and delicious palate of tropical fruit, candy sweetness and prominent hop bitterness that doesnt overwhelm. Its akin to tropical fruit juice mixed with hops and Spree candy.

The palate begins with a sharp, somewhat dry hop bitterness. Then the fruit flavors of grapefruit, passion fruit, guava, et al come rushing in. Its a wonderful combination of hop bitterness and hop-derived fruitiness. Im guessing this beer was made with Citra and Amarillo hops. I get a strong orange character which imparts some tartness, but not acidity. Theres noticeable sweetness too, like fruit-flavored sucker candy and it finishes with just a bit of resin or pine on the back end. The hops linger on the tongue and are rather dry, but so do the fruit flavors. A very pleasant sensation all around.

Drinkability: This is a beer that rides that fine line between single and double IPA in terms of robustness and complexity of palate. The hops are the star of the show, as it is quite bitter, but its bitterness reading seems a little low at 63.21 IBUs. The ABV, however, seems a bit high at 7.85%. It doesnt have the bulk or density of a beer that strong and theres no alcohol presence whatsoever. The delicious taste is made even better by the fact the beer feels so comfortable in the mouth and goes down so smoothly. A full-bodied palate for sure, yet it doesnt feel thick or sticky. Lagunitas Sucks Holiday Ale is versatile, too, as it would be ideal for spicy food pairings, but its tasty enough to enjoy as a dessert. Whens the last time you could say that about an IPA?!","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

2679,"2012-01-13",4.3,"Despite the interesting name, and the even more interesting story behind the name, Ive heard some very nice things about this limited offering and Im curious to try it.  The Lagunitas Sucks Holiday Ale is classified as an American Imperial IPA according to beerAdvocate, which isnt typically my style.  But, Ill give any beer a try at least once.

The Lagunitas Sucks pours out a brilliant golden amber color, with plenty of off-white foam on top.  As the head retreats it leaves behind quite a bit of sticky lacing, generally an indication Im getting myself into something a little too hoppy for my tastes.

The nose reveals plenty of hops, but more reserved than just the typical grapefruit variety.  Theres also an interesting layer of citrus hops aromas, as well as some subtle floral hops.  The aromas keep me guessing as well, something else in there is hard for me to put my finger on.  Im thinking its a some sort of bready or yeastiness, but I cant say for sure.

The flavors are, in no uncertain terms, incredible. The flavors follow the aromas nicely: lots of complexity in the hops, with something unique that I cannot nail down.  Theres a decent amount of hop-bitterness, but its much softer than expected.  The alcohol is fairly obvious for being only about 8% abv.  Theres a nice little bit of malts in the background, but the hops still take charge and lead the way.

Of the dozen or so winter releases Ive had this year, so far the Lagunitas Sucks is my favorite.","Connecticut, USA","TheCorkStops"
2679,"2012-01-12",3.9,"As a fan of the original ""Brown Shugga"" (not the over hopped version that was available last year), this caught my eye. I was able to have a quick sample before purchasing and Im glad I did. 

A - Wonderful lemon, citrus, and pine

T - Lightly bitter with a smooth grapefruit flavor. 

P - Very cleansing to the palate. This would be great with a dish that has a viscous component like a gravy. 

O - I really liked this beer and if it were a little cheaper, I probably would buy more. At $10 for a six there are other options. I also do not like many of Lagunitas offerings, so this was a pleasant surprise. Id bring this to a party for something a little different.","","jeremyhuffman"

The taste pretty much mirrors the nose with an added hop bite thats pleasing. A tropical blast up front followed by orange peel poured over a caramel malt backbone.

2679,"2011-12-29",3.9,"Quite similar to Little Sumpin Sumpin in my opinion.  Hoppy base with tangerine, citrus, with a rye finish.  Very drinkable beer here.  A fine replacement for Brown Sugga.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
2679,"2011-12-29",4.6,"Love the description on this one.  Poured into a snifter glass.  Color is gold with a very thin white head.  Aroma is complex with strong pine notes from the hops, some sweet sugariness in the background, and a hint of a tropical aroma of some sort.  Flavor starts with some sweetness and transitions into some of the wheat and rye flavors through the middle, then finishes with some resinous hop notes.  Medium bodied and smooth for the ABV.  Overall I think this substitute beer deserves to have a home alongside Brown Shugga in Lagunitas future winter offerings.","Elk Grove, California, USA","bnoel09"

2679,"2011-12-26",4.4,"Ho Ho Holy shit this is good beer.  Lagunitas has long made IPA after IPA Id sell my left lung for, and now theyve come up with an accidental seasonal that may be one of the best IPAs Ive drank in years.  This big, piney, citric, minty beast has whole cone hops wafting up  in the aroma, backed by a huge orange sweet roll.  And Lagunitas Sucks tastes, well, it tastes like a damn fine IPA should, immensely bitter and dry, yet the huge hops also have a mild sweetness that couples perfectly with the smorgasboard of malts.

This is a preemptive suck conclusion though, for when this ""replacement"" beer disappears from the market. Put Brown Shugga on strike again, because this beer is loads better. ASA my ass, this is a gloriously DIPA with just the mildest of quirky deviance courtesy of the rye and oats. Big, booming, and floral, its elegant, balanced, and massively refreshing.

Yes big time roto tiller plowing down my throat leaving a bitter wake. There seems to be some co2 in the appearance but its certainly lacking in this soapy mouth coating oily palate.

The aroma is caramel, fruity and sweet, peaches, mango and some other tropical fruit with some very aggressive citrusy hops. A medium to lighter bodied American Strong Ale. The malts are fruity and sweet, very tropical. The hops are citrusy and grapefruity. Good carbonation. A very fruity, yet very hoppy beer, that is nicely balance between the two extremes. Niuce crisp and dry finish adds to the hop bite. Not your usual beer from Lagunitas, and definitely not your typical holiday beer. I will miss Brown Sugga this year, but this is more than a respectable replacement. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean, dry and crisp.

The flavor is more of the same with insane hop flavors balanced nicely with some sweet maltiness that does not distract from the hop character or gum up the body. In fact it is very light and drinkable considering the ABV. My only complaint is about the very confusing packaging.

Pours a perfectly clear golden color with a medium head that leaves some lacing on the glass.

The aroma is dank and just purely hoppy, herbal, citrusy, hoppy, hoppy, and hoppy. The beer is endlessly pungent and just a pleasure to stick your nose in front of, it is anything but complex but it doesnt need to be complex it smells great doing exactly what it does. 

The flavor follows the ""simply hoppy"" theme. Some resiny notes work well alongside the citrus and melon character of the beer & the beer displays that wonderful tongue wrenching bitterness without a note of astringency that is as much a physical sensation as it is a flavor. The beer is largely dry but gives a perception of sweetness from all the fruit forward hops. 

Welp, at least I got to try it.

I was shocked by the light orange, almost pink-tinted pour.  I was still lightly under the impression this was going to somehow be a Christmas ale, of the traditional sort.  Nose is typical Lagunitas hoppy goodness, with a bit of the typical Lagunitas farmhouse funkiness.  The taste has the first burst of hoppiness, but a bunch of livliness and high fruit behind.  Bit of Hop Stoopid, bit more of Sumpin Sumpin, and a hint of the ""wild"".    I like it a bunch.  The more I drink it, the more I like it.

The liquid is magnificently crystal clear while a thick fluffy pillow of head puffs up instantly and then retreats slowly. The flavor comes across as semi sweet while also being bitter with a thick taste of sticky green hops that are just oozing oils and suggest flavors of pine and citrus fruit juice.

Once poured, it smelled like sticking your nose into a bag of hop pellets. Strong, grassy and citrusy. You didnt even have to get close to the glass to smell it. Pour was a near clear medium gold with a thin off white ring for a head. Taste was absolutely delicious. A true West Coast hop bomb that is actually available in my area! From beginning to end there is strong hop flavor. Lemon, grapefruit, grass, hay and slight notes of pepper. There is this underlying sugar sweetness that comes in right before the swallow and stays on the top of the mouth until the aftertaste (which is sharp, soapy and bitter).

Palate is very soft and silky and small saltwater quenching. Mild piney hop character. I cant believe it- Lagunitas best beer by a mile. Makes Hop Stoopid look a little stoopid. Why this is called a ""holiday ale"" is beyond me but this is on another level from Brown Shugga. Actually on another level from Lagunitas. How did this happen?

Theres some sweet citrus/lemon aroma with what I can only describe as a light petrol aroma in the background that Im guessing is from the hops (its not bad, just interesting).  Some seriously sticky hops hit up front with resinyt pine and vegetal notes along with a little rubber mat.  Good malt balance to add some sweetness but the hops keep asserting themselves in a very delicious way.  That hop flavor seems to evolve into some grapefruit character after the first few sips.

2679,"2011-12-12",4.1,"12oz bottle.

Pours a light, clear golden orange with a fluffy white head that leaves really nice lacing.

Aroma is pungent and in a good way.  Tons of juicy citrus with pineapple and grapefruit leading the way.  There is some pine resin but much less than the tap version which smelled like an evergreen forest.

Taste is not quite as big on the citrus with a little less grapefruit and a little more floral hops.  The finish definitely has some pine and a sticky resinous bitterness that lingers on the palate.  The taste also has a bigger bready malt backbone than the aroma.

The mouthfeel is excellent, medium bodied, strong carbonation and really sticky through the finish.

This is undoubtedly one of the best things Ive had from Lagunitas.  Im not sure why theyre never put something like this out before as it is better than any other IPA theyve produced.  Excellent beer.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Appearance: Clear, light honey in color with moderate, stark white head. Not too much lacing.

Aroma: Smells very tropical, with grapefruit, mango, peach, pineapple and other hop goodness. Also smells somewhat sticky and sweet as well, as expected from Lagunitas.

Taste: Sweet malty core of bread and caramel. Loads of hops on top, but not particularly bitter. Notes of grapefruit, pine and general spiciness. Slight touch of the rye that is in the malt bill (not sure I notice the wheat and oats that are also supposed to be there).

Palate: Moderate carbonation, with a sticky, medium body. Finish is dry, despite the sweet core.

The flavor is balanced, full of dry hops, and finishes like a dream. Amazing double IPA from Lagunitas.

Medium bodied with a prominent dry and bitter hop presence up front that lingers over the sweeter notes and pale malt backbone into a dry, boozy finish. Theres some sticky pine needle flavor which is countered by sweet citrus and tropical fruit, notably grapefruit, pineapple and lemon rind.

2679,"2011-12-03",3.8,"12 oz bottle from Jonathan Ron Brielle. Poured a clear copper body underneath an average sized foamy white head that leaves some solid lacing on my DFH snifter/tulip glass thingy. Aroma is loaded with lots of resinous hops, dry citrus rinds, orange juice concentrate, grapes and grains. Fuller body that is smooth with average to slightly bubbly carbonation and a lingering bitter finish. Flavor is mostly bitter hop bite with citrus rinds, yellow grapefruit and garins.

2679,"2011-12-02",3.9,"12oz bottled November 4, 2011.  Served at around 45F.

Pours golden amber with a two finger white head that leaves nice sticky rings of lacing and holds a small cap.

Aroma is orange, pineapple, some grapefruit, floral hops, some marijuana and bready malt, bit of fruitiness, hint of onion (Summit?).  Very good strength.  

Flavor is resinous hops, orange citrus, some pineapple, banana, bit of grapefruit, caramel and bready malt, hint of spice and onions, a touch of alcohol, finishes with good bitterness.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily, good carbonation.

Pretty good stuff...nice aroma, kinda comes across as a rye and/or danker version of their Little Sumpin Sumpin.  Definitely a far cry from Brown Shugga, but a worthwhile replacement brew for this winter.","Ringgold/Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA","elgiacomo"
2679,"2011-12-02",3.5,"12-oz. Pours a crystal-clear medium gold with a loose white head. Big sharp pithy nose of citrus rind, like fresh grapefruit peel on the table. Creamy medium body with lively carb. Very effervescent body compared to the amount of residual sugar and malt heaviness I might have thought itd push across--its actually very clean and light, almost lagered in a sense. Theres a sweetness and a spiciness there, a caramel and a pepper, maybe. Definitely not the caramelization you might expect in a holiday beer. Theyre not kidding mentioning the boil times on this one. Its rich and flavorful and definitely not a light summery beer, despite the nimbleness of the body. But its exceptionally delicate for a winter beer. Its an interesting choice for the holidays, and their positioning of it so self-deprecatingly is actually most becoming, because this beer really is good. This is a good sloshy football-marathon beer, ready to pound you into the couch at almost 8%. Probably going to have to get a few more of these for further research.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

So let me start this off by saying that this tastes pretty much like a Lagunitas. To me Lagunitas is like the Grateful Dead; it is unmistakable. The moment you take a sip you know it is a Lagunitas and this is no exception. Moderately hoppy, with a nice and subtle malt mixture made up in there. Absurdly easy drinking for the high alcohol content. Leaves a kind of sticky mouthfeel at the end, which is a surprise because you dont really get this in the texture. Excellent.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

Pours a mostly clear, golden-orange colored body with an inch thick, dense and frothy, white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is hoppy with a good amount of somewhat sweet oranges and grapefruits with an underlying resin. A bigger caramel backing with some bread as well as a light tropical fruitiness. Flavor is similar.  Lots of juicy orange and grapefruit citruses up front with a nice pine that has a light resin as well as a few tropical fruit florals. Caramel with a light bread balances the hops well while still allowing the big, somewhat sweet and juicy hops to shine. Finishes dry with some sweetness and a moderate, piney, juicy citrus bitterness that leaves a lengthy aftertaste. Medium body and a moderate carbonation. Overall, a solid beer. Well hopped with lots of orange and grapefruit citrus pines that give off a bit of a juicy, resiny, sweetness. The caramel is somewhat biscuity and balances well while allowing the hops to shine.

Aroma is of hops, rye, and tropical fruits. Taste is awesome and I also would have to venture to say i think its straight Citra hops all the way.

2679,"2011-11-28",3.8,"Bottle. Pours with a completely clear golden hue with a foamy white head that lasts and gives some pretty good lace. Aroma is what I expect for a fresh bottle of Lagunitas: hoppy (specifically dank and citrusy). Some pine and tropical fruit as well. Light tangerine peel. Malt aromas are honey, biscuity, and a bit bready. Mild esters. Flavors hops and a bit of crackery malt. Hops are first: citrus, grapefruit, mango, light pine. Bitterness is up front, medium to medium high but it doesnt linger into the finish. In fact the bitterness in the finish is somewhat neutral. Malt is bready, grainy, smooth, biscuity and a bit crackery. Id swear there is some wheat or maybe even oats in here. A hint of sweetness up front that melds well with the hops. Medium bodied, smooth and creamy. Lasting hop flavors. Medium carbonation.
