2041,"2017-04-26",3.6,"650 ml bottle, consumed about half the bottle. Color is a deeper amberish type, thin dying head. Aroma is weak oak, spices, bready malt, plums, and weak Apple.
Flavor is a very direct reflection of the aromas. Barrel treatment seems weak. Just a touch of oak. I guess the port comes out a bit in the form of plums and spice to my palate. Alcohol is a tad noticeable. Overall, not to shabby.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

2041,"2017-03-25",4.0,"This is pretty much like the breweries description of it. I dont think the Bourbon Barrel aging helps much though, as it gives it an overly alcoholic character.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"

2041,"2017-02-07",4.7,"Corked and caged big bottle pours dark amber color with a chunky white head that dissipates rapidly with minimal lacing. Carbonation bubbles up from the glass bottom. Aroma is oak, vanilla, hazelnut and bourbon. The layered, sweet-tart flavor mostly comes from the barrel-aging. I taste toffee, coconut, brown sugar, vanilla, sourdough bread, honey, butter, tart cherries and white pepper. Addictively delicious. Has an exquisitely soft mouthfeel.","Plattsburgh, New York, USA","shawnmurphy"
2041,"2017-02-05",4.3,"750 ml corked and caged. Aroma is oak, vanilla, circus peanuts. Pours hazy orange with a dissipating off-white head. Taste is sweet and savory with lots of barrel-aged flavors of wood, coconut, vanilla; finishes with a light tartness. This is seriously tasty. Its not your typical barrel-aged impy stout or barleywine. Barrel aging a bier de garde is unprecedented to my palate, so it gets points for being unique. Lots of points for being really good tasting shit, obviously, as well.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"

The barrel character doesnt really come through all that much, which is sort of typical of these Sierra Nevada barrel aged beers...Im okay with it in this case, too. Some oak, sweet toffee, caramel, and brown sugar. Kind of a funky and estery thing to the nose with some unripe pear, tart grape, and berries. Finishes sweeter than I would have expected. An interesting beer, certainly.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
