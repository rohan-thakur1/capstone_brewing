2163,"2016-05-14",4.1,"Sampler at the brewery. Quite dark murky brown. A beige ring of foam. A vinous aroma of red wine with all kinds of fruit. Earth and anise. Ridiculously complex stuff. I taste the wine, bugs, berries, rich malts, wood, and some latent sourness. Some kind of zing (best I can do to describe it.) I really like it and love the complexity. It is all over the place and everything works together so nicely.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
