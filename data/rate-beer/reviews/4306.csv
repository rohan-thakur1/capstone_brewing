Moderate amount of short-lasting, cream-colored head. Nothing wrong with the appearance but nothing special about it either. Scents of cream, butter, flower petals, Chardonnay, and champagne. Quite pleasant, fresh aroma. Good, German-like, helles aroma. Very nice, golden raisin to green grape taste. Chardonnay (buttery white wine). The flavor matches the aroma. Light body. Lively, smooth, and frothy while still crisp. Good lager palate effects. Really nice helles overall. Its a subtle style that is hard to stand out in this sort of rating system, but it is good. Im sure it would be even better on a hot summer day instead of the cold winter day in which Im drinking it.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
4306,"2016-01-01",3.6,"If a beer isnt reflective of its marketed style, but still tastes pretty good  can you really fault it? Thats the case with Cigar City Hotter Than Helles Lager as it really isnt to spec as far as traditional guidelines go, however, it does the job its supposed to. This is indeed a clean, refreshing, drinker-friendly lager than pairs with warm weather perfectly. Thats not something I get to say about a beer reviewed in January until I moved to Florida.

I poured a 12oz can into a tulip glass. It was canned on 10/22/15 and a six-pack cost $8.99 ($1.50 per can or $0.12 per ounce). 

Appearance: Pale, lemony yellow hue with a slightly cloudy body. Initially pours to a large, white, soapy head but it fizzles away quickly and completely leaving no lacing.

Smell: Pretty standard lager aroma with a hint of lemon, though very mild overall. Nothing off-putting at all.

Taste: Id imagine if this beer were judged against other Dortmunders and Helles brews it probably wouldnt fair well as its missing that distinct pilsner grain and spicy noble hop character. However, as a generic pale lager it works quite well. I have a feeling theyre using American hops in here since theres a noticeably citrusy taste, especially of lemon and maybe grapefruit. Theres even a faint trace of tartness to be found, in fact it might even be lacto. That being said, I dont find it distracting as it complements the citrusy components just fine. This would be a great transition brew for macro drinkers.

Drinkability: Considering that Cigar City is a Florida-based brewery and the majority of their market is in warm-weather climates, it makes sense that Hotter Than Helles would be marketed as a liquid refresher. And it definitely works as such: the mouthfeel is thin and crisp, but quite refreshing across the tongue. It finishes completely clean. At 5% ABV its arguably sessionable, especially considering its affordably priced and comes in cans. I found it difficult to drink just one.

RATING: 7/10","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
4306,"2016-01-01",0.7,"If you think a Helles Lager should be hazy, with a head that vanishes in 10 seconds, and tastes like squeezed sour grapefruit, then this ""beer"" is for you. And, if you are an alcoholic, this beverage is your cure. 

On the other hand, if you have tasted really great helles lager in Prague or Munich, you will be very disappointed with this beverage. It is rather apparent Cigar City used lactic acid to ramp down the pH as the tart notes are clearly there. I suspect the step mashing on this beverage eliminated the proteins needed to form a good retaining head. 

No surprise Cigar Citys site indicates it is not in production (my sample was canned on 12/02/15). I suspect they knew it was a lousy beverage and decided they had to cut and run. But not until they put this awful thing on the market instead of sending it to the vinegar factory.","Florida, USA","Apprentice"

Right off the bat, this beer is something of an emotional whirlwind and that is not something you can say about most beers. As far as what it looks and tastes like, well, let me just say this is not exactly a traditional helles. That is just fine by me. Beer can be brewed lots of different ways and still taste good. This one is slightly cloudy orange and headless. It is a bit of a simple beer but quite tasty. It is a little beet sweet and lemony mostly. The carbonation is quite mild which seems to enhance this sweetness. The hops really only come out as a slight bitterness in the finish but as it warms do lend a sort o floral or hay like aroma. This is clearly not a flagship beer for this brewery but it is tasty enough and serves the expressly specified purpose of being a nice beer to drink in the hot sun.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Other than a collaboration beer I had a few years ago that I dont remember the name of, this is my first CCB brew. And a good thing that its a light lager, because its a very difficult style to make really well. If a brewer can make a good, clean, vibrant hell or pils, thats really saying something...not so much an imperial stout or double IPA, which suffer flaws much easier. And on top of all that, I am especially fond of German lagers and have visited the country many times to quench that thirst. So this seemed like an excellent brew to sorta pre-judge forthcoming CCB products that will be rolling out here in Colorado. The result? Well, its somewhere in between disappointing and surprising. Its not as bad as feared, but not as good as hoped. Its kinda syrupy sweet, its kinda fizzy, and its not terribly clean. It just seems like not all that much love went into this...which is sad, because the best helles Ive had have been mind-blowing. On the other hand, it *does* have some aromatic allure, a nice floral hop bouquet thats thankfully not Americanized. In a blind tasting, you might indeed think it came from Germany. But in the end, its just kind of...well...uninspired. Compared to a hundred random pale lagers from Germany, this would be middle-of-the-road...which is pretty good for a young American brewery, no doubt. Hopefully their ales will fare better.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Aroma / Appearance - A golden carbonated base bubbles like a good fresh cola. Light grains, rye toast, and wheat hang in the air. This is smooth and gentle like an ideal lawnmower beer.

Flavor / Palate - The creamy mouthfeel is bright with life. Golden crisps, lemon extract, and wheat carry into a dry bitter finish. The drinkable factor of this would make it trivial to knock back at least three or four after a days work in the yard. Some breweries can take a note from the success of lighter styles like this.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

4306,"2012-05-29",3.1,"My Bottom Line :  
This grainy Helles moves into herbal hops before sharing a few odd green grape notes. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A ring of foam disappears into the cloudy blond.
-The watery mouthfeel doesnt have any elegance.
-I dont know if the bar is responsible for such a flat mouthfeel, but this doesnt help the brew one bit.
-Grain flavors are lengthy.
-This is flavorful, dont get me wrong, but it has none of the polished maltiness and fluffy mouthfeel I associate with the best examples of the style.

Nose is a bit grainy with small fruity peach and hints of diacetyl/butter. Great body: fresh, mild coconut, and peach atop full biscuit maltiness. No soap. No butter. Very impressive. Palate is quenching and super clean. As it warms the body gets a little earthy grain and hints of white vinegar. Mildly lactic palate. A very good attempt at a difficult style. Would like to see CCB do more stuff like this vs. imperial stouts and scotch ales.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Emphasis on a honeyed bread flavors. A lot of bounce in the taste gives it just enough complexity to go with the drinkability.  I have no idea why anyone would drink a macro lager if this was available.","Ambler, Pennsylvania, USA","DeputyAndy"

4306,"2011-11-02",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2012 Growler from OmegaX. Pours a nice bubbly orange. The smell is thick of spices, bread and hops. Again, bread and hops fill the mouth with a thick flavor that lingers into a sourdough/dry citrus aftertaste. Finishes pleasantly bitter and only a tad dry... overall refreshing. This beer is so incredible and drinkable - if you think you dont like lagers you need to try this at least once!","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"
4306,"2011-10-27",4.2,"Awesome beer!! Didnt expect this one to be so good. Nose is Honey Nut Cheerios. Honey and sweet malts/grain entice the nose and make this one very enticing. Like fresh baked sweet rolls. Poured out a nice clear yellow with a nice white head. Taste was super refreshing. Honey and fresh baked bread notes make this one a winner. Slightly earthy/grassy hops balance it out nicely making this one a definite winner. I could drink 20 glasses of this and still want another one. Great!","Florida, USA","OmegaX"

This is an easy drinking beer that would go great with wings while watching a game.","Florida, USA","Jlo7399"
