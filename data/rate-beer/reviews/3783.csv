3783,"2015-11-28",3.6,"Draft at Revolution. Pours a hazy reddish brown color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have banana, cloves, caramel, toasted malts, hints of chocolate, a hint of alcohol, spices, are they using Belgian yeast, creamy mouthfeel, decent enough.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
3783,"2011-12-07",3.9,"On tap at the brewpub, 11/03/2011.Pours a very cloudy, opaque mahogany with wisps of head making their way to the top. Sharp aroma of banana with some clove, dark bread and a touch of tart yeast. Flavor is rich with banana, clove, dark bread, some citrus -- pretty much just like the aroma. Palate is thickish and tingly with lingering banana and clove on the back of the tongue. This is the best wheat beer Revolution has produced as best I can tell; gives brewpub-down-the-streets very solid Dark & Curvy a good run for its money.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"
3783,"2011-11-23",3.1,"Draft at Revolution. Nut brown-red, thin cream ring, lightly oily with wisps. HEavy bubblegum nose, light wheat, bit of pepper lasting through. Flavor shows wheat at front, medicinal cherry through hot mid-palate, bit of citrus with more wheat and pepper following into a lightly barky gum finish.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
3783,"2011-11-14",3.7,"Tasted on 11/14/11 on draft at Revolution.  Pours a hazy dark mahogany with a thick, rocky tan head that slowly recedes to spotty lace, leaving a thick layer of residue along the inside of the glass.  The nose is malty banana bread with nutty toffee, light baking spices, and a lightly toasted aroma.  The flavor is really dominated by the banana, with the nutty, toasted, spiced, and bread malt qualities all present, but subdued, and some bitterness as well.  The body is medium with lively carbonation that creates a creamy texture, and a long spiced banana nut bread and lightly bitter finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
3783,"2011-11-13",4.4,"Snifter at brewpub with Kevin: Very deep mahogany brown with some ruby highlights topped by a lasting off-white head. The nose is everything I expected and more from the style... banana, clove, roast, caramel, biscuit, wheat, aromatic esters along with slight chocolate, coffee and black pepper. WOW, nicely balanced weizen versus bock character. Banana, clove and wheat working in harmony with the roasted and sweeter malt with a figgy and chocolate undertone. The mouth feel is lively yet smooth, perfect body that is not too heavy nor too light. Shockingly YUMMY, I really liked this so much that in my second return later that day I had another snifter. Glad to hear they got the yeast dialed in... kudos Revolution for the best beer I had all weekend!","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
3783,"2011-11-11",4.5,"On tap:  The aroma consists of strong banana, clove, light chocolate, roast, and a touch if alcohol.  Its a dark murky brown with a small beige head that quickly fades to a thin ring around the edges if the glass.  The flavor starts with a quick dose of chocolate and dark fruits.  The finish has moderate banana, clove, and a touch of alcohol. Medium bodied light-moderate carbonation.  Overall, a top of the line Weizenbock.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3783,"2011-11-05",3.8,"Draft.  Best of the wheat beer series.  Pours cloudy brown with slight tan head.  Aroma of banana, chocolate, spicy.  Good flavor, banana dominates.  For 8.5% beer, it seems fairly light.  Good stuff.","","User29624"
3783,"2011-11-02",3.8,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a deep amber brown with a small creamy light beige head. Aroma is nice and wheaty with a light spicy kick, cocoa and banana. Flavor is also well balanced, the banana and clove staying in check with the rich cocoa and wheat character, just well done from start to finish, hiding that 8.5 abv quite nicely. Medium to medium full body and a soft carbonation. Very nicely done.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","FunkyBrewster"
3783,"2011-11-02",3.9,"Man this was good.  Really impressed by Rev recently.  This is a style that when its spot on is delicious, or when its off you dont want to even sip it... this was one of the best weizenbocks Ive ever had.  Highlights were the chocolate note in the flavor and the near perfect body/carbonation.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"
3783,"2011-11-02",3.7,"Draft at Revolution. Third generation of the yeast its the charm as this is the best of the wheat beers in the line. Pours a murky brown with copper at edges and a persistent head. Nose is pretty bright, mix of banana and clove as well as noticeable ethanol. Quite bready and spicy, tending almost to Belgian. On taste, its got a lot of phenols going on but never numbing or off. Creamy mouthfeel and the booze is subdued in the taste. Finishes pretty dry. Pretty solid for a style that Im not big on.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
3783,"2011-11-01",3.6,"Sample at the source.... Pours a murky caramel toffee hue and topped with a thin wispy light beige head... Aroma of banana esthers alongside a standard Belgian yeast strain. Caramel and grain to share the limelight... Flavors are a continuation if the same with banana, dark fruit, and sweet malt and grain. Medium to full bodied with adequate carbonation. Pretty solid for the style.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
3783,"2011-10-30",3.6,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a deeper mahogany colored body with a finger-width, creamy, tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma has lots of sweeter and riper banana esters with some toffee bread sweetness to the malts. There is also a good amount of softer clove spices with a hint of wheat and a touch of chocolate. Flavor is similar. Lots of banana bread with sweeter esters up front before a bit more of a distinct malt comes in. Toffee, a touch of wheat, and some slightly caramelized biscuit possibly from a long boil. Clove kicks it up a touch at the end and helps this somewhat dry with a light peppery alcohol warmth and barely a hint of cocoa alongside a very light bitterness. Fairly sweet, but balanced before leaving a pretty lengthy aftertaste. Medium, creamy body and a soft, medium carbonation. Overall, a pretty solid weizen bock. Fairly sweet with lots of banana, but the clove and slightly caramelized toffee bread along with the very light bitterness keeps this well balanced. Nicely done beer.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
3783,"2011-10-27",3.4,"Draft at Rev, pours a dark murky brown with some off white head around the rim. a big sweet aroma with loads of banana and cloves, notes of toffee, figs, brown sugar. flavors have a bigger dark fruity and brown sugar character while banana plays a smaller role. lots of figs, toffee, caramel, and wheat notes comoing through. spices of cloves and pepper. med bodied, good dose of booze coming through is an issue. im not crazy about this style but i found this to be a little too sweet for me, however, it was a fairly well done weizenbock which is a nice change of pace cause you rarely see these done.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
3783,"2011-10-22",3.6,"Draft... Dark mahogany, light tan head, looks exactly like ba skara brae... the aroma is mostly banana, a little toast, simple but good.... The taste is sweet and a total banana bomb, might as well be drinking pureed banana with brown sugar, cloying at first but gets easier to drink by the second, the alcohol is hidden extremely well, finishes lightly bitter, which breaks up the sweetness... Good","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
3783,"2011-10-22",3.8,"Draft on tap at the brewpub (Chicago, IL). Pours a deep dark brownish hue, some glowing amber edges come through, a healthy darkness, murky haze, with a decent offwhite small ring of a head that laces small. Aromas are a touch of stink with some essence of sweetness, toffee, and mellow roast. Some estery banana, toffee, faint brown sugar. Initial is banana, a good dose, with some chocolate chip, essentially my sisters Banana Bread, with some carmelization, sweetnesss, toffee, biscuits, and toast. Into the back, throwing a faint fruity tartness (Though the base has many layers and darkness to it). Brown sugar, carmelization, toffee, fruit. Finish is fruity dark and ominous, despite the dark big wheat reckoning. Some dark fruit, a ton of banana and carmelized malts, just a dusting of cocoa. Its really quite nice, a proper body, it is overly sweet (But I feel it should be). Best beer of the night, and rightfully so. Id love to run it up against the GI Weizenbock. Considering this is what it is, its a great example of such a style. Keep this, do some work on Hefe Loco..","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
