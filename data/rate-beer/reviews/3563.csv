3563,"2017-06-20",4.0,"This one was fondly remembered from our initial VT beer journey and held up well during our re-visit. It pours a thick hazy orange yellow with a sour citrusy lemony aroma with just a kiss of the hops. The taste is a balanced mix tween gosey sour and pale ale hops. It is complex and smooth and utterly compulsively drinkable. Good for sitting on a bench with yr friends and chowing down on a meat and cheese plate in the sun.","New Haven, Connecticut, USA","meccahh69lol"
3563,"2017-02-27",4.0,"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color Gose with a nice white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of tart notes with some citrusy notes and light fresh grapefruit notes are also noticeable. Taste is a mix of tart notes with some floral citrusy notes, light grapefruit notes and some very faint bitter notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Solid take on the style, very refreshing and something I wish I could drink more often.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
3563,"2017-01-11",3.5,"Pours an orangina from a bottle with thick white head, very effervescent, overly so. Aroma of citrus and even a little pine. Flavor is a wonderfully refreshing orange/lemon soda (like a fancy European one that costs $3 a bottle or something and ends in -ina or -etto), with a hint of salt. Well-balanced salt, citrus, and hops, although again too bubbly for me. Also earns a demerit for the worst cage Ive ever had to open, it was twisted nearly to the end, thought I was going to have to dig out the needle-nose pliers to open it. Pretty good beer.","East Falmouth, Massachusetts, USA","Quick3Beers"

3563,"2016-12-07",3.7,"Une bière blonde, jaunâtre, trouble, avec une grosse carbonatation. Au nez, on sent le côté salin de la gose, avec une odeur de céréales fraîches. En bouche, lamertume est surprenante dentrée de bouche. Le gout salin, qui rappelle en quelque sorte lair marin fait également sa place. Une petite acidité faible est ressentie en finale, tranquillement, pour laisser place à un côté houblonné fort plus présent. Pas mauvaise cette The Wind mais peut-être trop amère pour apprécier sa complexité pleinement.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","LouisP"

3563,"2016-03-25",3.7,"750mL bottle shared by blisscent on 3/18/16.Pours a very hazy dull brass with a good amount of white head atop that slowly recedes to cover.Brett and lactic acid are joined by very soft citrus rind and bright citra hops adding must, tangy lemon juice and various pithy notes. Nothing aggressive here, nor is it heavy in any one category. Soft funk, citrus, light biscuity/nutty malts and a pinch of salinity/seawater character for good measure. No alcohol or flaws.In the mouth its equally reserved on the grapefruit, with light astringency from the actual grapefruit and tons of floral characteristics from the yeast. Hops add light lemon and mild bitterness while theres tons of wheat chewiness and a lot of dough. The doughiness is a bit problematic, but Im not sure if thats just the bottle not being allowed to rest after being transported from purchase, or if the beer comes off that way. Lactic acid sourness on the end is moderate and the carbonation is mostly tight and the body creamy-to-oily with some wateriness contributing to drinkability. Would like to try again.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3563,"2015-12-08",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 2, 2016 My Bottom Line:
Grapefruit pith, wheat and flowers laden with citrus zest see lactic and salty undertones elevate their union to an enthralling one for anyone seeking complexity, creativity AND refreshment.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam tops the cloudy pale yellow.
-Saltiness is perfectly leveled with the rest of the flavor profile.
-Drinkabilty is very high.
-The aroma is captivating.
-Tartness is just present enough to make this as refreshing as lemonade.
-Effervescence is quite high as well, which makes everything feel even lighter and brighter.

3563,"2015-08-26",3.6,"This was poured into a stange.
The appearance was a hazy pale yellow with a light transparency enough to allow some carbonation to be seen rising. A one finger white foamy head started and hung around for a good minute. Lacing is spotty yet foamy here and there.
The smell had a huge amount of grapefruit running into sweet to bitter citrus rind. Sweet pulp of grapefruit smacks a super light pine underneath. Sour citrus is really light.
The taste takes all of the previously mentioned flavors and melds nicely. Salt is barely there, so it tastes even more refreshing than other goses. Sticky bitter to sour lemon /grapefruit aftertaste leads into the finish.
On the palate, it runs light and refreshing subjugation my tongue to sticky sour sweetness. Personally, it feels great to me.
Overall, as much as I like this beer for what it is to me and what Lost Nation did with it, I cant quite right call this a true gose. To me, its a really good Berliner Weisse.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3563,"2015-07-07",2.2,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2015 Served on tap at the BVT airport Skinny Pancake. Either something is wrong, or it is some twisted alchemy of the ingredients here that made this a confounding mess. Pale, hazed white peach appearance. In flavor and aroma, grapefruit, salt, lactic acid, and citras capability for lime zest astringency seem to combine to imitate spoiled yogurt, or, to be accurately gross, a babys ear infection, cheesy foul weirdness. It is crisp, and texturally sharp. It may be the additives to the original gose - itself a respectable rendition to the style - rather than some error in process that led to this undrinkable flavor, but given everything I perceive, an infection of some kind might be at fault.  Until I can reassess, with due respect to Lost Nations assured quality, this ultimately tastes like an amateur, shortcut sour.

Overall: Im a fan of the Lost Nation Gose (and Gose style in general). I think Ive had a firkin or maybe cask pour of this at a special event, so Im glad to see theyre starting to brew a few more batches and bottle their special/limited beer. While Im not a fan of grapefruit beer, this beer isnt bad. I do prefer their normal Gose over this one. The salt and coriander, while present and well balanced, is slightly overpowered by grapefruit. Very tasty and very easy to drink. A great beer, but grapefruit just isnt my thing. The body and carbonation are spot on. Very well made, very clean, very solid beer. Similar in sour/tartness as the Lost Nation Gose.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","jamesewelch"
