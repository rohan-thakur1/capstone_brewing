965,"2014-11-10",4.7,"In short: The ultimate bright sessionnable funky blonde ale.
How: Bottle 22oz, consumed with many months of age on it.
The look: Medium cloudy glowing blonde body topped by a medium white head leaving lots of lacings on the glass.
In long: Nose is in-your-face funky, a superb bright and clean brett character blending harmoniously with a vibrant tropical fruitiness. In mouth the beer has a fluffy-foamy texture supported by a very lively carbonation that is never aggressive, great mouthfeel. Taste has very crisp crackery cereals, fresh white bread, a lot of clean funk, fresh tropical fruits, mild acidity. The bright funk character and overall flavor profile was somewhat reminiscent of a Jolly Pumpkin Bam Bier but without the sourness of the Bam Bier and this made the Table Beer immensely sessionnable. I cannot think of a better beer that combines sessionnable and funk qualities. I loved that beer very very much and now Id really like to know how to tell the difference between a male bottle and a female bottle because I have a conscience problem here","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Appearance: Pours a hazed, light straw-hued body with a lofty, foaming, white crown of suds. Meringue-like lacing.

Smell: A touch of hay-esque malts, a spritz of fresh lemon and lime, half of a pineapple ring, and some Brett notes. As some of the yeastier deposits from the bottle make their way into the glass from latter pours, it picks up a big, spicy, floral perfumy quality.

Taste: Light, mild-mannered pils malts, very low, sans-crust bready quality and just a hint of sweetness. Soft touch of lemon-lime citrus. A few drops of pineapple juice. Heck, maybe some green apple. Lightly bitter. Agreeable, leathery funk character. Coriander and fresh florals later on. A little bit of mineral and a rebound of oily, moist citrus on the staunchly dry finish. 

Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Well carbonated for a nicely crisp mouthfeel.

965,"2013-01-20",4.6,"Bomber. Pours a very slightly hazy medium golden shade. Vibrant streams of effervescent bubbles feed a billowing, tightly packed head of snow white froth. Tall, looping arches of pronounced, patchy lace mark the glass. The nose is fantastic, showing a dry, supremely well attenuated, bready malt base. Dusty brettanomyces funk lends notes of dried pineapple and high-quality aged, sharp white cheese. The wild yeasts also add softly sulfuric, eggy tendencies. Hops are abundant, lending ample grassy, piney aromatics. The flavor follows suit, sharp and dry, quite bitter with all the grass and straw notes. Distant tropical fruit adds a subtle fruity note. The sharp, dusty brett has beaten the malt into submission, yielding the driest possible remnants of bread crumb and cracker. The mouthfeel is perfect  bone dry, lightly prickly, and cleansing. The bottle disappears way too quickly. This is an absolutely phenomenal beer, one that Ill likely go through is mass quantities while I can get it.

This is very close to a perfect biere de table.  Big white head atop a hazy color of unfiltered pineapple juice. Mellow, sour-funk aroma married to a lightness of yeasty esters. The flavor is where it comes into its full glory. Mineral and lightly sulfered (less so than Avril), just barely tart, grapefruit pith through the middle, bitter bretty finish. Great big flavor and full mouthfeel, certainly not hindered in the least by its low ABV. Brilliant. A ten for flavor is not out of reach here.

A steady pour into my small St. Sebastiaan tulip produces a three-finger thick, frothy, just tan tinged, off-white colored head. The beer is a yellow gold color that shows a brilliantly clear, pale, straw-gold hue when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of herbal and lemon like hops, it has a substantial phenolic character that leans towards plastic, perhaps a hint of rubber and a bit of medicinal chemicals (all in a good way, and all seemingly Brettanomyces derived), and perhaps just a hint of dried grassy and cracker like malt, but this last is quite subtle.

The beer has a nice carbonation, a quite light body, but has a surprising amount of body to it considering the Brettanomyces and the alcohol level. There is a nice, chewy, wholesome, pale malt graininess in the middle, and the finish has a biting hop bitterness to it that melds with a touch of yeast derived spiciness as well as a touch of herbal hops and phenolic plastic like character. There is a soft lemon character to this beer that seems to be hop derived, as well as some pine-like and green herb character. The malt flavors that this beer has are quite nice, it is all from the pale malt, but it complements the hops and light funkiness quite well; without this cracker-like, and dried straw backbone, this beer wouldnt be anything near what it is. This has a spiciness that lingers on the tongue after each sip; peppery, perhaps a touch ginger like, and with a very soft fruitiness that has suggestions of ripe, floral pears. The fruity notes from the yeast and hop character comes out a bit more as this beer warms up.

A fantastic beer, that is just about always going to be something I crave. I am a sucker for these lower alcohol, slightly funky, hoppy, full flavored but exceedingly quaffable type beers. Again, if these werent such a staple of my brewing, I would be buying these all the time.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Moderate Brettanomyces, with some citrus tartness.  The flavor is dusty, funky orange, pineapple, and mango, with lightly bitter grass.  Peppery, slightly spicy citrus and pine finish.
