1921,"2014-08-26",3.1,"Rated based on notes taken 6 Oct 2013 -- This is a solid beer, can art is pretty awesome too. Beer is malty, firm hop flavor and bitterness. Finishes with that ester-y English flavor.","North Dakota, USA","GreatDane1632"
1921,"2014-06-19",3.6,"Pours a nice deep amber color with off-white head. Spice, dark fruits, and toffee on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with a slightly sweet note.","Dallas, Texas, USA","TXBadger"
1921,"2014-03-09",3.4,"Thin-bodied in appearance, this English pale has a touch of caramel color and a fastly diminishing, airy cream-colored head. The key to enjoying this beer, for me, comes only with acknowledging the intended style, something that the can design/label does a great job of evading. The nose is pleasantly light and sweet, very clean, with a defining English character. In the mouth its really better than I expected, even after having this a number of times in the past while consumed straight from the can. Heres a little advice: just because a brewery sells a beer in a can doesnt mean you should drink it from the can. Please, dont drink this from the can. It tastes downright nasty when paired with aluminum. In a glass, though, its clean, English sweetness is a treat, with a touch of earthy grains and some spicy hop bitterness. This really should be consumed at a cooler temperature. Its very enjoyable when served cold... but once it warms up its best to stay away, especially if youre drinking it from the can. A glass really allows the beers cleanness to slide right down the palate. Its a highly sessionable, clean-finishing beer with a neat, spicy hoppiness that sustains on the tongue gracefully for a few seconds. Bueno!","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"
1921,"2014-02-19",3.6,"Reminds me of a lager almost. Clear dark brown colour with an average sized off-white head. Floral hops and caramel malt in the aroma. Mild bitterness, floral hops and malty sweetness in the flavour. The aftertaste is slightly bitter. Rather good English style IPA.","Richardson, Texas, USA","gringo332"
1921,"2014-02-19",3.6,"Amber color out of the can with a fluffy off white head. Fruity nose with some grainy notes. Very fruity ale with some toffee and toast. Very bubbly on the tongue. Very tasty if a bit too much carbonation.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
1921,"2014-01-20",3.4,"Can: &nbsp Orange side of amber, thin frothy white head, little lacing. &nbsp Very pale fruity nose, like apple or pear skin. &nbsp Otherwise faint biscuit. &nbsp Very similar on the tongue, a little bready. &nbsp Doesnt have that signature Ashtray type presense. &nbsp Seems a little biscuit, some fruitiness, witih a soft bready backside. &nbsp Feels a bit chewier than others. &nbsp As bitters go, this one seems a bit sweeter than others. &nbsp Fine by me as its not a style I usually enjoy.","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
1921,"2013-12-09",3.3,"I didnt remember the style when I opened the can and poured. First aroma that hit me was fruits then toffee - I thought this might be a scotch ale? Taste was toffee, slight alcohol then a drying slight hop finish - one of the few bitters I have had - ok brew...",", Texas, USA","crajun"
1921,"2013-12-04",3.3,"Pretty decent English ale, malty backbone, low on the hops. Would prefer if the finish was a bit cleaner, but not bad at all.

1921,"2013-11-11",3.8,"Clear copper with a thin foamy off-cream head. Nose is biscuity and toasty with a little english hoppiness, without any of that mineral water tone other English bitters have. Taste is clean and medium-full bodied, with biscuity/toasty flavors of dry english malts, definitely some Maris Otter, and a little bit if dusty earthy toffee. A bit simplistic, but refreshingly clean and lacking any noticeable impurities or distracting off-flavors","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

1921,"2013-10-29",3.7,"I left this one sitting in the fridge far too long. Not that it went bad or anything, just that I kept picking other beers in part because I wasnt sure what style this was.

1921,"2013-09-07",4.1,"Smell is light, but is a perfect blend of floral hops and subtle honey sweet malt. A nice rich orange amber color with soft carbonation. Taste is very nicely balanced with good bitterness and really nice maltiness. Just an incredibly smooth easy drinking and flavorful beer. Carbonation seems soft from the pour but it gives a nice prickle still and feels more carbonated than it looks. I really liked this one.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"

1921,"2013-08-30",1.9,"Sad to say a band who put out the great, Age of Winters would put out such a loser of a brew. Malty head. Carbonation too overwhelming! Thin, tinny taste. Dry wash down. Real Ale does not do this band the proper justice! Dont believe the hype! Absolutely forgettable as well as regrettable brew!!!","USA","brewballs"
