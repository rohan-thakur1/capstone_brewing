1228,"2014-06-02",3.7,"Sampled from a 0.33l bottle @ Bergen Ølfestival. This one pours a watered down Cola brown blurry looking body with a small quickly sidesticking beige top. It has a nice gentle sweetness on the nose, I get a good caramel, some soft wet dark fruits, raisins and if I look well and long perhaps a swift of wood. It has a lovely flavor this. Lots or red dried raisins and cranberries. Damn, this is actually surprisingly tasty. Theres vanilla, its beyond recognize infused with wood. Its also surprisingly lightdrinkable and light on the mouthfeel. A bit sticky sweet, but I feel it suits it quite nice and it has a gentle prickling carbonation level.

1228,"2014-02-23",3.9,"I brought this one up to our mountain cabin just to have the pleasure to enjoy it while surrounded by 1.5 m of pure, white snow... It pours an almost clear dark brown body with a tiny, off-white, short-lived head that doesnt leave much lacing. The moderate aroma is very sweet, with lots of lovely, sweet honey. Also plenty of dark dried fruits, and in the back I get gentle hints of whisky. The taste is heavy sweet, but the moderate bitter long-lasting finish ensures that the beer doesnt feel cloying. Strong flavours of honey, dark dried fruits, dark caramel and hoppy hints, all on pleasant bourbon backdrop. Very pleasant mouthfeel, the beer is full-bodied and oily with a soft carbonation. Its been a couple of months since last time I had the Imperial Polaris, but if my memories serve me right, I get less coffee and citrus in the Superior, but far more honey, and the barrel ageing has absolutely made this nice beer even better. Much of the hoppy crispness that the Imperial had when it was fresh is of course gone now (in both beers), but Id trade hops for whisky in a beer like this any day. Go Ringnes, go!

1228,"2013-11-17",4.0,"330ml bottle bought at Vinmonopolet Tromsø Sentrum. Served in a tulip glass. Pours a rather massive, slightly fawn-coloured, head reduced to a low, bubbly film-type layer. The body colour is deep dark ruby and near-clear. Inviting smell of mid-sweet dried fruits, like raisin and prunes, with earthy malts beneath. Delicious taste character of dried fruits, dark honey and vanilla surrounded by bourbon, and offset by a nice touch of citrus to a long-lived ending. Integrated, warming alcohol. Mouth filling and full bodied, still dangerously easy to drink. Well made. A few more bottles bought for my cellar and ratebeer fellow Skinnyviking.

1228,"2013-10-31",3.8,"Bottle, 2013 vintage. It pours an unclear, deep copper colored body and a dense, finger-thick off-white head. A bit surprised it isnt clear, as the unbarreled 2012 edition was. But I dont mind, it still looks nice, and leaves cute lacings. Id expect more impact from the barrels in the aroma, theres still quite a lot of honey and dried fruits, but not much wood or bourbon. Theres some coffee hints, but the faint citrusy note I found in Imperial Polaris seems to be gone, months on barrels seems to have taken its tolls. In fact, all aromas seems to be less pushing, the honey in particual. One good thing about it is, that even though the aroma of the Imp Polaris wasnt very boozy, the aroma of this beer is even less boozy. Theres some tannins and spirits in the flavor, which is mostly sweet, but still sort of balanced by the hoppy bitterness. Caramel and prunes, some coffee notes and a touch of citrus blends in. The finish is maybe a bit more on the boozy side than Id prefer, but considering the beer is probably best enjoyed relaxing in your favorite chair, it doesnt matter, such beers should kick a little bit I think. Anyway, its sure a nice beer, but I prefer the Imp Polaris, and the Julebokk even more. And the Julebokk doesnt have the faint metallic touch in the finish, which the Polaris have. Guess Ill have to dig up some money to have some for my cellar, its a fine brew, and I think itll be even finer next Christmas. 131031","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

1228,"2013-10-06",4.1,"Bottle at home. The beer has a cloudy, deep reddish brown colour with a small, light beige head. Its aroma is characterized by much bourbon and additionally vanilla, brown sugar, dates and much wood. Is pretty sweet but quite pleasant and not overwhelming. With such an exciting aroma I was curious about the taste. And it didnt disappoint! The flavour follows up and is complex and sweet and nice. Mouth feel is smooth and full-bodied, and the beer has a light bitterness. The beer appears to be pretty sweet, but I enjoy this very much. It is both balanced and tasty, and perfect a late night in the winter months.","Bodø, NORWAY","Foffern"

1228,"2013-09-23",3.8,"Bottle, courtesy of the brewery - thanks Sigrid! :-) Pours a cloudy orange-hued deep amber body with a medium creamy off-white head. Aroma is mild oak and bourbon tones straight away, followed by sweet caramel notes, assertive vanilla, honey and hints of bread dough, grains and burnt sugar far in the back. Taste is heather honey, bourbon, oaky tannin notes, vanilla, grains, sweet caramel, bitter herbal tones (the citric peel, perhaps?) and hints of burnt sugar and faint coffee in the back. Complex and well-modulated, with the high ABV only showing as a warming streak rather than standing out in any way. Full body, soft to medium carbonation. Very nice, and much better than the first, non-barrel aged version in my opinion.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

1228,"2013-05-04",3.5,"330 ml bottle, from the brewery. ABV is 10.5%. This is the bourbon oak barrel aged version of Imperial Polaris. Dark brown colour, moderate off-white head. The aroma has remarkably moderate but still recognisable notes of bourbon / vanilla / oak, on a background of mild coffee, caramel, chocolate and heather honey. The orange peel is hardly noticeable in the aroma. The flavour is very smooth, definitely smoother than the Imperial Polaris, and the ingredients blend in fairly well. Bourbon and oak are there, but they do not dominate. Malts, caramel and honey form the backbone, the Simcoe hops in the finish are quite moderate.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"
