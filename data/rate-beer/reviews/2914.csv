2914,"2014-10-27",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 28, 2014 750 ml clear glass swing-topped bottle from the Beer Authority. 

This is one gorgeous looking cider. Its a deep glowing brown, no head of course. I love the way the light plays off of this one. Just beautiful. 
The flavor is somewhat sweet, the rum present but never dominant. Plenty of apple, of course, and very crisp. Molasses contributes without making it too sweet. The mouthfeel is thick and somewhat hot; this deserves the apple wine moniker. Nonetheless its quite easy to drink and goes to my head like no ones business. A super-tasty cider, on the sweet side, definitely on the rich and high boost side. The price is fair enough for what you get, but at >$20, a bit high for everyday consumption. 
A nice swingtop bottle lets you split it across a couple of nights, which is an advantage where prices is concerned and which makes sense enough given the high ABV. On day two the aromas are actually more prominent; I get lots of rum and also some maple syrup / brown sugar which I suppose is actually a fusion of molasses and imagination. The more I drink of this, the more I love it. Yesterday upon opening I think I wanted something a bit drier and more thirst-quenching. Tonight this is an perfect bullseye. Delicious. 

tl;dr summary: Exceptionally rich apple wine flavors on rum.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
