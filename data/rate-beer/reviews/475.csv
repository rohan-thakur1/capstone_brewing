475,"2017-03-27",3.7,"From notes. Enjoyed with Doug at his place on March 22. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a lighter black color with some ruby shining through around the edges. There is a soft thin ring of khaki head and no lace as it vanishes. The aroma is really roasty. There is a strong lactic character to it and a light chocolate toward the finish. Its more of a dusty chocolate than anything. There is a little earthiness to it, but this just isnt my thing. The flavor is very similar. There is the strong bitter roast up front, a light chocolate, and a pretty good lactic piece. I dont get a lot of milk stout to it, but the lactic sweetness is interesting. The mouth feel is thin and watery with a lighter carbonation and a hint of roasty malt on the back end. This is light stout, and just affirms that Im not crazy about Trilliums dark beer program. Oh well.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Nice, robust, lightly roasty and nicely toasty aroma. Just what you want a basic stout to smell like. But the body is so thin and carbonation so low that the flavor goes a bit limp. Theres also just a faint acidic bite at the end. Just a wee bit. Chocolate, roast, roast, earth, old coffee, leaves. Light-bodied, with low carbonation and a thin, smooth, earthy, lightly roasty mouthfeel. Doesnt deliver on the aromas promise, but still not bad.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

Ive found that Trilliums non-hoppy beers (saisons, barleywines, etc) are not quite as mind blowing as their hop bombs, but this proved me wrong.
