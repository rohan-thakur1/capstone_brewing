4525,"2012-01-18",3.7,"Draft at Zlý Časy, summer 2011.  The body is a cloudy, light yellowish-golden shade.  A tall, spongy head of snow white foam lasts a good long while, leaving behind thick sheets of lace.  The nose carries a distinct, yet subtle, egginess, lending a hint of sulfuric character to the underlying softly sweet dough malts.  The bready sugars are pillowy, working nicely with the yeast.  Hops lend a kiss of citrus, and perhaps some lemongrass.  Solid aroma.  The egginess tends to drop out of the flavor, leaving more of a standard Bohemian pils profile.  Doughy, sweet, bready sugars are cut with a hint of acidity, while a spicy, grassy hop bite rushes in to claim the finish.  The palate is medium-bodied and easy going.  Its quite a quaffable brew, thanks in part to the moderate carbonation and crisp, softly acidic finish.  Solid brew.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

4525,"2011-04-23",5.0,"UPDATED: MAY 13, 2011 Updated rating: One of my all time favorite beers. This batch is the best pilsener Ive ever had. The second bottle best before July 3, in a very cold refridge all this time. Still have one more in there. This beer is the epitome of noble hop bitterness paired with the dry bready flavor of pilsner malt. Seek this beer out fresh. Follows a very specific flavor eigenvector through multidimensional space. Unidimensional (yet complex?), totally hedonically satisfying.  The yeast pour changes this beer, makes it just moderately sweet, amidst a crushing natural bitterness through the nose and on the tongue. Scored raised from 4.4 to 5.0. Original follows: April 23, 2011. SOOO crisp and dry, lip smacking bitterness, excellent beer all around. 75 cl presentation, hand-labeled with a best before date of July 3, 2011. Bright golden color, very, very dense head. Quite effervescent, which contributes to the dryness. Almost none of the oily body I sometimes get with Bohemian Pilseners. Just the slightest hint of buttered toast compliments the huge sourdough bread maltiness. On top and all over this thing is bitter, starkly bitter grassiness. Some herbs and pencil shavings in the aroma. Incredibly fresh. Bottle-conditioned; slight haze in the beginning with lots of goodness at the end. The yeast pour brings, as expected, a great softness and a lovely (but slight) white bread sweetness. One of the single most bitter noble hops brews I have had and at an excellent ABV; I personally dont want it any higher. I can drink this beer, in this condition, all day long and every day of the year - it is that challenging.
