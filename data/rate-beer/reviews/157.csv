157,"2017-05-28",3.8,"(500 ml bottle) Pours a deep ruby beer, practically black, with fine carbonation, and a creamy off-white head. The aroma is laden with coffee, chocolate, and tanned leather - an immediate archetype of the London porter style. This is followed by hints of raisin, toffee, tobacco smoke and mineral water; then pine, oak, vanilla and earth towards the finish. The mouthfeel is medium-light, smooth and silky on the palate, and slightly effervescent.

157,"2017-04-05",4.0,"Ive been searching for this beer for years, from back when porter was my favorite style and Id just found ratebeer. London Pride was easy to find, but bottles of this were never around anywhere in Seattle. It went on draft one time at Bottleworks, but keg blew before I got there. I saw it on draft once in 2014 on a trip to Iowa, but I ended up drinking Toppling Goliath and a Wine Barrel Noir instead, foolishly figuring itd be easy to find in the midwest when visiting family.
 Never saw it on draft again. Or in bottles. So imagine my surprise and delight when I stumbled across this 4-pack at the Party Source. Your days of eluding me have come to an end, Mr. London Porter. 
Dark brown pour with khaki head of moderate duration that dissipates to a ring. For lack of a better description, this is sort of what I imagine from an Old World porter -- less aggressive on the roast bitterness side than my American favorites, but with a richer malt profile. Caramel, toffee, bread, creamy milk chocolate, hints of dark fruit. These flavors come in waves, finishing with a light roast bitterness of short duration, followed by lasting chocolate. Medium- body; slick texture, average carbonation. Overall: this is bottle 3 out of 4. The first bottle I opened warm as soon as I walked through the door and was a bit disappointed. But the last two bottles have impressed me more and more. Well-deserved reputation. Hope it doesnt take me another 5 years to come across this one again.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

157,"2017-03-23",3.6,"The beer pours ruby-black with a nice, beige head. The aroma is not very intense, there are typical porter flavours - chocolate and roasted malts.

Purchased a few of these as singles for a discount price in the St. Louis, MO area. Ive had this beer numerous times before and consider it a classic (bottle and draft). Consumed 01.17.2017. For a $1 a bottle, its totally worth it despite being old. Lets start with the appearance in an imperial nonic glass; its a dark-brown with chestnut hues when held to the light and has a light amount of head. Smells like a quality porter, on point to the style -- bready, sweet, moderately roasty. Goes down smoothly, lighlty bitter, decent carbonation, and has clean finish with a hint of sweetness. Pumpernickel bread best sums the flavor. When fresher, my score would likely be a 4.5 or so.","","balloonbuffoon"

When poured it looked pitch black at first but upon closer inspection was a very dark ruby red with a minimal tan head. The taste is complex and strong, filled with the same fig and raisin tastes as that of the smell, there was a definite wine quality to the drink and it was very creamy in the mouth.

 Chmiele:  Fuggles 
 Kolor:  Przypomina nieco coca-colę. Ciemnobrązowy i jest całkowicie przejrzysty. 
 Piana:  Wysokie wysycenie niszczy pianę.
Piana jest kremowa, drobnoziarnista. Szybciutko opada do niskiego krążka. 
Lacingu brak. 
 Zapach:  W aromacie wysoka czekoladowość.
Gorzka czekolada i odrobina słodkich pralin. W kolejnym niuchu lekka paloność i ciemne owoce.
Na deser buchnięcie kawy i sporo karmelu.
Spodziewałem się, że zapach może być płaski, tymczasem spotkało mnie miłe zaskoczenie.
Jest wyraźny i intensywny. 
 Smak:  Bogaty, kompleksowy - dokładnie tak jak na etykiecie.
Początek to mocna gorzka czekolada, odrobina słodów palonych i ciemne owoce. Śliweczka miesza się z ciemnym winogronem.
Jest też solidna karmelowa podbudowa, upiększona przez szczyptę toffi i orzechów włoskich.
Faktura średnia, półpełne ciało. Jedna jedyna rzecz, która tutaj nie pasuje to to zbyt wysokie wysycenie, które sprawia że piwo staje się chwilami zapychające. 
 Wysycenie:  Wysokie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Piwo kupione w Budapeszcie w sieci sklepów Spar.
Powiem szczerze, że jak na piwo z sieciówki w cenie 500 HUF (500 węgiesrkich forintów = ok. 7zł.) to całkiem solidna pozycja.

157,"2014-11-15",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 17, 2016 Bottle, 500 ml. Pours very dark ruby with a small amount of soapy tan head which doesnt stick around too long. Aroma consists of strong notes of dark malts, slightly burnt wholemeal toast and black coffee, with smaller notes of dark fruits, toffee, molasses and dark chocolate. Edges of wood and earth throughout, but the big note is still that toasty one. Taste is a fine sweet/bitter balance; the caramel, muscovado sugar and molasses square off against the dark roasted malts and black coffee with neither side emerging as a clear victor. Finish is a bit sweeter overall with a lingering beady, cereal-y yeast note. Body approaches full with no watery characteristics whatsoever, while the texture is still relatively thin and lightly carbonated. Somehow quite refreshing, all things considered! More or less the gold standard for what a good porter should be, going some way to living up to its extremely high regard.

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  Pours a deep brown color with a one finger cream head. The head has a decent level of retention, eventually fading to give a nice level of lacing.

 Smell  The aroma is a wonderful blend of sweet chocolate and caramel, dark fruits of cherry, a bit of coffe and a good roasted brown bread smell. It is sweet and dark in aroma. Very nice.

 Taste  The flavor begins of more brown bread with some notes of caramel sweetness. The caramel sweetness is enhanced as the flavor moves on and is meet by some mild chocolate flavors. These flavors create a rather sweet and bready flavor. The flavor then begins to dry out ever so slightly in the end with some bitter sweet chocolate and coffee flavors coming to the tongue. The mix of all the flavors combined together well and leave a very pleasant cocoa espresso flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  For an only 5.4 % abv beer the body of the beer is on the smoother and creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. The feel is wonderful for all the dark and bittersweet flavors of the brew accentuating them and allowing them all to properly mellow on the tongue. 

 Overall  This is a fantastic brown ale. It has a great flavor with fantastic transitions. It has a great feel and a wonderful smell to boot A very good one to try if you have the chance. Delicious.","","Darkmagus82"

This was poured into a pint glass. 
The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute leaving a really nice looking foamy clingy lacing sticking around the glass. 
The smell had a nice sweet to roasty to earthy chocolate maltiness combining wonderfully in a light bitter under current of coffee. Continuing on as it warms, theres a nice light vanilla arising to complement the rest of the flavors. 
The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors and combined them pretty well. Theres no aftertaste but it has a decent dry sweet chocolate finish. 
On the palate, this one sat right at a medium on the body with a slight sessionability about it.

157,"2013-06-05",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 10, 2015 Can. Dark brown body with a reddish hue. Tall beige head. Aroma has milk chocolate and very soft hints of coffee. Smooth roasty taste with more chocolate. Light hoppy finish. This is a nice porter indeed but I have come to expect much more from beers that make their way inside the 100th % here. Drinkable? Sure. Fantastic? No.
Re-rate: After having about 20 cans/bottles of this I must reconsider: yes, this is a fantasitc porter. One of the few beers that is drinkable even warm because its so chocolatey and milky. The key is in the balance. 
Re-rate: Several cases of bottles/cans over the years. Upping the scores even higher. This is the best porter and a quintessential beer. Again, the key is in the balance, not being quirky or extreme. Being supremely drinkable should be every beers goal. Fullers have mastered it. I would even say its the best dark session beer that I know of.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","thirstyrabbit"

157,"2013-05-11",3.8,"500 ml bottle bought at Olivers The Delicatessen in Central.
Clear deep blackish brown colour; One and a half finger head and lovely crumpety beige foam which last for 1 minute; Sticky lacing and active carbonation; Fragrant aroma of roasted malt, dark coffee, burnt toffee, dark chocolate, sugar and light grass; Pleasant and tasty light sweet taste of dark roast malt, with strong smoke, burnt toffee, black coffee, dark chocolate, very light liquorices, strong nuts, dry biscuits, citrus and strong grassy hops; Medium body, not so thick but really creamy palate; Taste profile is very smoky, nutty, and roasty dark malt with tasty black coffee and light chocolate in a creamy background. Not as rich as Youngs Double Chocolate Stout, but its smooth creaminess is more than made up any deficiency; Hoppiness is moderate to light grassy nose, good limey citrus in taste, and a slow and penetrating light bitterness and astringency last til finish; Fairly dry after taste, very easy and creamy to mouth.

Comments: I know I shouldnt compare this one with Youngs Double Chocolate Stout, yet they share so many similar characters I think I should give it a fair run with YDCS as a reference. It has really good aroma and taste, esp. the smokiness and nuttiness are simply outstanding. Great creamy mouth feel as expected. Because its not intended to turbo - Chocolaty taste, so its cocoa-ness may be not over the roof as YDCS. Plus its body is not quite thick and rich enough. Still, this is a labour of love, true to the tradition, and definitely worth revisiting. Recommended.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

Very very dark brown colour, almost black. with a soapy beige head, almost two fingers tall, with average retention and good lacing left around the glass.
Very intense aroma of roasted malts, rich chocolate aroma right after that and some coffee on the background.
Taste follows the aroma, agian lots of roasted malts and a slight bitterness because of them, then the chocolate kicks in and stays on the aftertaste too, without covering the bitterness but working along with it.
Full and rich on the body, and good amounts of carbonation.
Overall, delicious!","Arnhem, NETHERLANDS","Christos"

157,"2013-03-01",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 12, 2013 appearance: almost black dark brown beer with a brown head. Not much foam unless you give it a good poor. Loses the foam quite quickly. 

smell: caramel / licorice sweetness and coffee scented malts. 

taste: Caramel and dark chocolate sweetness, tart like. Followed by a licorice and coffee, slightly bitter and dry, finish. 

mouthfeel: Its thinner then a Guiness. Doesnt have that creaminess to it, but makes it more refreshing and easy to drink. Medium carbonation. 

overall: I like this stout. Its thinner then most, but is packed with flavor. Its not hiding in subtleties, but just delivers the coffee, chocolate, licorice and caramel flavors with a nice balance of sweetness and a light bitter. If i had to criticize it, id say its lacking a bit of depth. Its not something id drink all night, because it starts to bore a little after one. Although to me, this is quite common for a stout. It may be a little too sweet and straight forward for me to enjoy even more. But its one of the better stouts out there, so id say: recommended!","NETHERLANDS","Xstream"

157,"2012-11-12",4.0,"I often mock the British beer scene for being too boring and archaic, but sometimes a traditional British brew really hits the spot. Case in point: Fullers London Porter. While not the most robust or complex beer ever made, it definitely is impressive for its ability to be so tasty and so smooth for an old world style brew.

I poured an 11.2oz bottle into a nonic pint glass.

Appearance: Deep dark ruby red thats seemingly opaque black. Forms a huge, tan, frothy head which lingers and leaves gorgeous lacing on the glass.

Smell: Classic porter aroma of black licorice, milk chocolate and dark malts.

Taste: There actually isnt a lot happening with the palate to Fullers London Porter, but whats here is just so good. A blend of slight confectionery sweetness, a hint of coffee bitterness and a lingering chocolate candy aftertaste are the three main components to this brew. Its simple, yes, but theyre so enjoyable for their distinctiveness and the way they all transition together. Not quite as sickly sweet as many stouts, and has less bitterness as well. I think this may be the absolute best beer to give to someone to show that ""dark beers"" can be flavorful but not intimidating. Light sweetness and light bitterness create for a perfectly balanced, delectable body.

Drinkability: As satisfying as the palate is, I think what really makes this such a good beer is just how easily drinkable it is. The body is on the thinner side (for a ""dark beer""), but its not thin or watery per se. Its velvety smooth across the tongue and might even be considered refreshing for a moment there. The aftertaste isnt completely clean, but just enough to leave a pleasing taste that doesnt dry out the mouth. At 5.4% Fullers London Porter is dangerously drinkable because it could easily be sessioned all day, even though its a tad too big to technically be a session beer.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Aromas of big milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, cream, roasted malt, coffee, toast, light dark fruit, and light herbal hops.  Fantastic aromas with great balance and strength.  Taste of milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, coffee, roasted malt, cocoa, citrus, toast, and herbal.  Good amount of citrus and roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, roasted malt, toast, cocoa, and herbal on the finish for a good bit.  Fantastic flavor balance and robustness; zero cloying flavors on the finish.  Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice.

The smooth slightly bitter chocolaty aftertaste just keeps going and going. On the palate, once again, balance is the key, a rich mouthfeel without losing an ounce of drinkability. This a beer you can either sip and savour or simply chug like a madman, but I guess that is a bit of a waste. The one beer I always try to have in the fridge.

Rich, burnt sugar front; dark powdery chocolate comes in before a heavily smoky, bitter, charred wood backend. Nice level of earthy hops and malt on the finish. Very long swallow; a continuation of the complex flavours of the palate with inklings of liquorice, Madeira and ash.

157,"2012-08-02",3.5,"A: The color is a deep, dark brown with crimson / ruby highlights that emerge when held to the light. The color is deep, but the beer is not opaque. After a vigorous pour, the head stands in at nearly two inches thick, rising to the crest of the tulip glass. It gradually fades over a few minutes, leaving ample lacing in its wake.

S: The aroma grows stronger as the beer warms, but overall, its the weakest aspect of the beer, in my opinion. Nice notes of chocolate and subtle roast aromas are the most prominent scents.

T: The beer tastes quite good. The beer leads off with a heavy chocolate flavor, followed by subtle coffee notes. The roast character is subtle, with extremely little hop presence in the finish. Overall, the flavor could be a bit more aggressive, or bolder. However, the beer is balanced very well and its quite easy to drink and enjoy.

M: Carbonation level is great. The beer is light to medium bodied with alcohol presence virtually non-existent.

D: A solid example of the style. Its not my favorite porter, but I definitely recommend it.

While pale ales are all about the hop/malt balance and the stronger IPAs are about the balance between different types of hops, the key to porters is the balance between the chocolate, coffee, and malt flavours.

Some hops can be barely noticeable but adding some complexity of dry leaves. Taste is strong, semi-bitter with very clear roastiness. Notes of bitter chocolate, fine tobacco, mokkacino and caramel.

Aroma of rich coffee, dark chocolate, burnt caramel and some plum pudding. 

The taste is very similar to the smell, lots of chocolate, coffee and caramel flavours in there. 

Dry and a little watery for such a dark looking beer, strangely the chocolate, coffee and caramel tones do not stay for long in the mouth. It does however sweeten up as the flavours die.

Strong, rich malts to begin with and some nice chocolate notes. Light sugar with some figs and a touch of coffee. Light alcohol towards the end but overall this is pretty well balanced.

Mahogany with a light brown and bubbly head that eventually settles to a small head a couple of millimetres tall after about two minutes. Retention is good.

Dark chocolate and figs kick things off here along with the faintest bit of coffee and alcohol. There is some rich malts and some burnt sugar.

Medium bodied and quite smooth, it is mildly carbonated but a little lighter than I was expecting although not thin at all. The taste is a rich some and with a moderately bitter finish.

Very rich with strong chocolate and roasted malts making up the majority of the taste. It was a well balanced and complex porter that I fairly enjoy and would most likely have again. For a porter it was surprisingly refreshing and went down well.

157,"2012-03-15",3.5,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/18/2011.  Poured from an 11.2 oz. special branded bottle into a pint glass.

Most of the beer in my glass has a mahogany or ebony color, but a good amount of the edge has a cranberry tint to it. A rocky beige head forms on top before fading to some scattered patches. No real lace to speak of, and it took a decently aggressive pour just to create any real head.

Deep bitter chocolate, burnt roasted malts, a bit of smoke, vanilla, some oak, and a touch of charred molasses give this complex aroma.

There is a touch of molasses sweetness up front, but this beer is fairly bitter all the way through. A bitter dark and charred malt brings a bit of tobacco and smoke with it, setting the tone for a bitter dark chocolate and lightly roasted coffee bitterness that persists for the rest of each sip. The finish remains bitter.

The burnt nature of the malt imparts a slightly acrid feel, and the residue left around the inside of my lips is bitter and oily. It is dry with a noticeable acidity to it as well. The carbonation is on the light side and neither is overly creamy or crisp. A medium body compared to other porters I have had.

Nose is licorice and leather in blended harmony, flanked by some milk chocolate and faint coffee tones. Taste is licorice, leather, coffee, dark chocolate and subtle notes of burnt caramel, all extremely well integrated. It lacks the fruitiness that Ive somehow come to associate with porters in general; Fullers London Porter is more in the stout (read: burnt/coffee tones) territory than anything else but this is solid material nevertheless. The mouthfeel is velvety and vivid, maintained by a soft carbonation and a thick mouthfeel thats never too cloying or demanding.

There is an excellent smokey bacon aroma up front, which combines with coffee notes to create an alluring breakfasty scent. The smoked bacon is present to begin, but is soon overtaken by a rich coffee taste and a velvet-smooth whipped cream texture, giving the feel of a Vienna coffee. The finish is smooth and lingering.

Poured from an 11.2 oz brown embossed bottle into an Imperial pint glass. Label in simple, displaying the name, the breweries crest, and s mall man at the bottom carrying a tray of drinks on his head. Best before 05 APR 11.

Appearance: Pours with 1 finger of light tan head. This settles to a series of islands of foam not quite covering the surface of the beer. The beer itself is a clear mahogany with a distinct ruby tone. No sediment in the bottle.

Smell: Wow! An amazingly rich and creamy nose with strong aromas of toffee, cream, and roasted marshmallows.

Taste: Mellow semi-sweet malt upfront with a follow through of caramel toffee and coffee. Finishes with a lingering mix of roasted barley and mild hop bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Lower than average carbonation, as is appropriate for this style. Body is very good.

Drinkability: Whatever hesitancy I had after seeing how it looked following the pour were overcome by the amazing aroma. A solid, flavorful drink that I would kill to try on cask.","Ohio, USA","beveritt"

It smells like brewing dark beers with that huge roast and chocolate maltiness. There are just enough bittering hops to prevent it from being too sweet. They start on the front of the tongue and fade to the huge roasty, chocolate malt flavors. Just a fantastic lingering finish to it.","Vista, California, USA","rcubed"

A - Deep mahogany brown to black with ruby hues on the edge (cola colored). Good sized, thick, foamy, creamy light beige head with good retention and leaving a nice lacing.

S - A lot of coffee and roasted/burnt malt. Also a fair amount of caramel and toffee, but not a great amount of chocolate.

T - Rich roasted malt, chocolate and caramel flavors start the sip with a somewhat sweet taste with a little bitter roasted malt. This gives way to a good amount of espresso and coffee flavors along with some more profound roasted malt, giving it a bit more of a bitter taste. The finish has some more of those sweet flavors along with some vanilla, and the coffee still has some presence.

M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Pretty smooth and creamy.

D - A very drinkable beer. Good porter tastes with a nice balance of sweet and bitter. Easy to drink a number of these in one sitting. Good and easy to drink beer.

157,"2009-11-09",3.5,"Near black pour with just faint hint of mahogany highlights and a big, frothy, tan head.  The aroma smells like malted chocolate milk with a fair amount of roast and a hint of coffee.  The malted chocolate milk flavor really continues through from the aroma with a few notes of coffee, brown sugar and dark fruit.  The body is a bit on the thin side but has a nice creaminess to it and soft carbonation.","Berkley, Michigan, USA","punkrkr27"
157,"2009-11-09",3.8,"Had a few of these on tap at Elephant & Castle in Chicago. Came out a deep black color with a small tan head. The aroma consisted of roasted malt and coffee. It was very simple but was very pleasant. The taste was a wonderful mix of roasty malt, light coffee, and a sweet taste that may have been a hint of chocolate. This was very easy to drink. The only part of this beer that could be improved is the mouth feel. It could have been a bit heavier. Overall, a great beer though!","Streator, Illinois, USA","General66"
157,"2009-11-07",4.0,"Pours coal black with a light head.  Mild, but flavorful, aroma of coffee malts.  The flavor is classic porter - smoky, coffee notes with noticable chocolate sweetness.  There is a good amount of hoppy tingle as well.  Fullers London Porter manages to be bitter, sweet, robust, and mellow all at the same time.  It goes very well with the freshly baked apple pie that Im having with it.  I hear that this used to be in RBs Top 50, and it is still the #2 ranked porter.  This certainly seems like a gold standard porter to me.  Is this the beer that made London famous?","USA","Slipstream"

The nose is a nice chocolate, nutty, roasty experience.  the appearance is dark drown/black, which permits dark red light through it when held up to a lamp.

Low carbonation, thick, very creamy mouthfeel. Impressive! Complex flavour has chocolaty and coffee-like notes, with atrongly bitter dominant espresso taste on top. Dry, fresh finish balances the initial heaviness - how could a dark beer be better balanced. Another characterful, but well-rounded winner from Fullers.

Chocolate really seems to dominate this brew as this flavor is again, most noticeable.  Other flavors do follow such as the deep bitter roasted coffee and toffee.

Delicious nose of cocoa and cream.  Theres another element that Ive yet to identify, but it is attractive and drawing.  Its almost like burnt toast or a mild smokiness.

Now that Ive identified, I really notice the smoke, although it is subtle (not like a rauchbier).  Some burnt biscuit with a dollop of whipped cream.  The swallow features bitter chocolate and touch of cherry.  Wonderfully complex.  If there is a moderation of the excellence, it would be in the body--modest with an above average level of carbonation.  The aftertaste is more cocoa.

The aroma was astonishing good, with licourous port wine sent, along with dark chocolate, coffee and roasted-it-all: from wood to malt. Into the mouth, you know, angels sang. The chocolate seemed to be already exactly mixed with coffee for the best experience, with dark malts flowing from side to side retouching any possible flaw. Some caramel and molasses came along the ruby wine taste. But the big prize was for sure in the aftertaste, with hints of bitterness from the coffee, the warm good-bye alcohol feel, and some faint nutty flavores mixed with faiting chocolate.

Similar flavor profile to the aroma, with slightly larger presence of floral type hops starting in the middle and finishing nicely in the end with an easy rich malt lingering, smooth and maybe just o so slightly too light, but still a great feel.

Poured a dark brown with some red notes in the light with a decent cocoa colored head that beings to dissipate to a thinner film. Aromas are amazing, consisting of chocolate and other roasted malts, coffee, and a bit of a lactose sweetness that I can smell very easily. Wonderful. Initial taste is of dark rich roasted malts with a chocolatey smoothness that follows. A bit of a bitter coffee finish that ends up smooth and memorable, with an aftertaste that is similiar to the whole taste progression of the entire brew. A medium to heavy bodied brew that feels ich, but still possibly sessionable for someone else that might love darker roasted malts more than I.

157,"2008-05-24",4.5,"Tasted 24/05/2008.  Magic nose, reminding me of the dark Orkney beers - very dark chocolate with a little whiff of dark and vinous fruit. Toasty biscuity malt weighs in nicely behind - tending towards burnt.  Superbly integrated in the mouth.  Fruity, biscuity, high % cocoa chocolate... like a nice coffee, from the place at the bottom of The Terrace in Wellington... and then theres more a lingering slightly burnt toast in behind.  Hops barely make an appearance, theyre just supporting in behind with a little bitterness. Perfect weight and carbonation.  Drinks easily, like a beer a full percent lower.

157,"2008-05-07",4.1,"Aroma: Smoky and sweet. The most interesting thing I noticed about the smell is that there is a distinctly Scotch ale side to it, with a peaty caramel odor. You can smell it most strongly right as you sip it, which adds a lot to the overall flavor.

Appearance: Looks like Newcastles evil twin, or maybe the bastard son of a Newcastle and a Guinness. Very dark, with brownish auburn tones, similar to Worcestershire sauce. Thin, ash-colored head reminds me of toasted marshmallows.

Flavor: Highly mocha-esque, with lots of caramel coming through. Thats not to say its like a Frappucino or something, because theres nothing sugary about this beer. Its bitter through and through, with notes of roasted nuts. It has a clean, sweet finish, and the aftertaste is all espresso, but unfortunately it doesnt last long.

Palate: Pretty light and creamy, which is rare in a beer with this much flavor.

Overall: Very easy to drink, but I think this might come at the expense of the taste, which deserves to be a little denser and richer than it is. Overall, though, my senses were satisfied without being overwhelmed. Very nice!","Kitakyushu-shi, JAPAN","soulgrowl"

Poured a chocolate brown color with a small creamy tan head.

The smell was very enticing, coffee grounds and chocolate. My mouth was watering in anticipation.

My mouth was not disappointed. The chocolate and coffee blended beautifully on my tongue. Holy crap, its like my tongue just had an orgasm.

It had a nice full mouth feel, as Id expect from a porter, but the carbonation level seemed a bit high to me - jabbing at my tongue with sharp little bubbles.

Great beer. Wait, did I say that already? Well its true. Definately something Ill be drinking again and again.

157,"2008-04-25",4.9,"Poured a bottle into a pint glass. 

Very, very dark brown brew with ruby highlights. Half inch off-white head after a vigorous pour. Slowly dissipated, leaving only slight lacing on the glass. This was about the only thing I could find not perfect about this beer. 

Smelled of chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, some coffee and cream, maybe even some cinnamon toast. Very complex and layered, and it keeps improving as the beer warms. Boy, does this aroma ever make me want to drink this beer! 

The taste was fabulous. Roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, toffee, molasses, and just enough hop bitterness to cleanse the palate. The flavors are layered and keep evolving as this beer warms. It is quite possibly the best tasting beer Ive ever had! 

Smooth, creamy, just thick enough to provide great body without being sticky or cloying. Enough carbonation to keep it light without being fizzy. A slight lingering flavor of coffee and dark chocolate that leaves you wanting more and more. 

Extremely drinkable. Moderate ABV and awesome flavor makes for a great drinking experience. I wish I had a few more bottles of this available. It is fantastic.

It tasted almost watery, the palate was not as thick and rich as I had expected for a nice dark porter, and it just seemed generally lacking in complexity.  It was a fine beer, but I felt that it was only fine, and not worthy of the reputation (or the price) that is associated with it.

157,"2008-02-10",4.3,"Appearance: dark brown color with reddish tones. Great head with beige color, dense and very lasting.
Aroma: toast and sweet from malts. Breads smells reminiscences from yeast. Chocolate, coffee, caramel, cream and vanilla smells reminiscences. Too, aromatic fruitiness likes figs, raisins and blackberries.  
Flavor: toast-malts start with medium insensitive and very lasting. Pleasant touch of bitter-chocolate, coffee grains, caramel, toast-bread, truffles, cream and some wood. Fruitiness similar to nuts and toast-hazelnuts; like also to ripe-fruits like blackberries and figs. Dry final with Fuggles-hops taste, but the mainly dryness come from toast. Slight metallic touch. Toast aftertaste.
Palate: medium body with an exquisite smooth and silky texture. Low carbonated.
Good balance, pleasant and lasting toast, nice bitter-chocolate taste. An exquisite beer.","Santiago, CHILE","davidpl"

It just tastes too thin for my liking.  I has some great chocolate and prunes going on in the aroma, and those carry over to the flavor, but it just doesnt have the creaminess and lingering malty and hoppy finish that I associate with a solid example of the style.  Everything is just too subdued for me.  I dont find it nearly as interesting or delicious as the Nogne O Porter, and it doesnt have the weight or richness of Sierra Nevadas porter.

157,"2008-01-28",5.0,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2008 From the bottle, this is nice, rich, and a bit high on the chocolate end for a porter.  It is almost black red-brown with a medium,  dense, long-lasting tan head that leaves some good, creamy lacing.  The smell is at first rich, ceamy milk chocolate, then this becomes more subdued and mocha-like, joined by toasted brown bread, hints of prunes and caramel, being full and sweet.  The taste is predominantly toast and a rich milk chocolate (rather than bitter dark chocolate) mocha, with elements of fruit, especially prunes, caramel, and a hint of coffee.  Despite these traits, and the heavily toasty, caramelized quality, it does not taste burnt at all, lacking any acrid quality, and is very smooth and even throughout, with great sweet-bitter balance.  Its smooth and thick, a bit oily.","California, USA","Wulfstan"

Roasted malt flavor floods over the tongue, followed by a faint hop prod. Notes of burnt toast, dark chocolate, bakers chocolate, cocoa powder, smoke.

The aroma was moderate to heavy roasted malt, mild coffee, bitter chocolate and cocoa powder. The only thing that could be better about the aroma would be for it to be stronger.

Palate is a bit too thin for me - but usually porters seem that way to me. However, there is a very nice smoothness to it.  Light malt flavor.  Little to no bitterness.  Nice smooth finish.  Easy to drink.  Pretty darn good for a porter","Austin, Texas, USA","pintsize"

I was advised from the person looking it up in his stock book that Fullers London Porter was No longer made. A sad day for this Porter Lover.

Finish comes in with a bright sweet roasted flavor that rolls into a rich mellow toasted flavor backed by a gentle bitterness.  In the end there is a heavy sweet tone that hangs.

157,"2007-09-22",3.8,"11.2 fl oz from Sicilianos Market in Grand Rapids, MI.  Deep brown almost black color with ruby tint and nicely colored small tan head that kind of looks like a bubbling pancake.  Aroma is rich dark malt, coffee, chocolate, a little smoke, and maple syrup.  Flavor is very meaty with a lot of smoke, pretty strong coffee at first that fades and is overtaken by the meatiness, very interesting for a porter.  Body is too thin for me, but British style porters tend to be too thin in general.  Overall a very interesting porter, was actually expecting less.  I guess the only big negative is the body and that Im a vegetarian eating a very meaty tasting beer.","Grand Rapids/Chicago, Michigan, USA","xnoxhatex"

157,"2007-09-01",3.5,"On tap at Volo. I was happy to finally come across this beer after months of effortless searching. Smell was of roasted barley and cocoa beans. Flavour followed a similar pattern with roasted barley, coffee, smoke and dark chocolate. Here is the weird thing about this beer. It disappears. Upon the first sip, all the flavours can be experimented with, but it doesnt round out, or finish. There is no satisfaction in the swallow, it just disappears and makes me wonder if the beer just vanished on my tongue. Leaves a lingering, somewhat unpleasant bitter taste. Its a good beer, but it would take a really fixed scenario to get me to enjoy this. Figures though, as I greatly disliked Fullers London Pride.","Peterborough, Ontario, CANADA","RaphaelN"

The flavor is the same.  It literally tastes like a mocha milkshake.  This is, without a doubt, the smoothest, easiest drinking porter I have ever encountered to date.

Aromas of lightly sweet malt, soft chocolates, and chewy toffee.  A touch of smokiness and a soft caramel malt presence.  Im getting some buttery diacetyl right away in the nose, which detracts unfortunately from an otherwise nice bouquet.  Light bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel.  A nice gently toasted coffee maltiness immediately covers the tongue; gentle roast with a hint of earthy smoke.  More diacetyl becomes apparent on the back end of the palate, but not as pronounced as in the nose.  Minus the diacetyl, a pretty good brew, but nothing astounding.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

The nose is of coffee and a slight whiff of sweetness, perhaps chocolate. Complex flavours include coffee and chocolate. This is what the jokers at Mill St. were trying to create when they thought up a Coffee Porter. However, while this one hits the mark with balanced complexity, the Mill St. is dollar store knock-off vile.

The aroma is of chocolate and coffee with a faint cardboard that fades away. (Ill chalk that up to its age.) The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth with a light burnt coffee bitterness at the finish. The flavor follows the nose: chocolate and coffee with a creamy burnt coffee finish and a touch of sourness. A very clean and easy drinking porter.

157,"2007-06-03",3.7,"Appearance: Pours out a clear, translucent dark brown color with a frothy khaki-colored head that deflated rather abruptly leaving a ring of fine bubbles around the glass.

Smell: A fine, hearty scent of dark toffee, bittersweet chocolate, and rum raisin ice cream.

Taste: The taste is not nearly as profound as the aroma. Some chocolate, vaguely coffee-like flavors within. A delectable roasted sweetness permeates every sip. A hint of licorice and vanilla as well, no questions there. Finishes with a very mild hop bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, with just the right amount of carbonation. Notably smooth and creamy.

Lovely sweetish roasty aroma, cakey, and dripping with molasses. Very dark brown, small tight beige head.

This definitely is one of the better porters, but still has that awful sour taste & finish most porters do.  Great chocolate taste, but this doesnt do it for me.  It has chocolate overtones, but does that make a beer? (for Youngs Double Chocolate Stout it does). Theres some balance between sweet & bitter, but little too bitter, and sour like i said.

The contrast of such a dark beer (zero clarity) and such a white lacing is amazing.  I may be going crazy but the beer is so dark it may actually make the lacing look whiter.  Aroma is strong, nice roasty aroma, probably the best roastiness I have ever experienced.  Actually smells like a burning cig, not the nicotine part but just the part that burns the paper and some tabacco, oh its nice.  Also roasted peanuts.  Nice chocolate and a good caramel sweetness that is distinctively british malt but to its highest level.  Taste is starting to level off with some cardboard coming through b/c of oxidation.  Still plenty of sweetness, chocolate, and some roastiness.  I think this beer peaked about 6-8 months ago in flavor.  The body is starting to thin out as well.  Leaves a charred chocolate aftertaste, low on bitterness.  This is the best non-baltic porter I have ever had.

Toasted malt dominates the flavor along with a subtle molasses sweetness and a hint of coffee. Dry and creamy, medium body. Finish is bitter then slightly-sweet as the molasses and coffee notes linger. While this is not my favorite porter, it is indeed a rich and quite quaffable brew.","Denver, Colorado, USA","JasonBMoore"

English pint bottle

Poured a clear deep dark mahogony brown with a large frothy somewhat lasting light brown head with fair lacing.

Smelt strongly of molasses, coffee, roast, mild chocolate.

Taste was upfront moderate bittersweet dark chocolate with molasses and coffee tones followed by a strong burnt malt bitterness that turns into a clean crisp long bitter coffee finish.  Mouthfeel was medium bodied, oily, lively carbonated, with moderate astringency.

Overall, a classic.  Drinkable, plenty of taste, well balanced.  Just straightforward excellent porter taste.  One of the easiest porters to enjoy out there.","Midland, MI, Michigan, USA","xav33"

Nice roasted aroma and a smooth mouthfeel.  Does not hold up to extended aging at all as I found out with a couple bottles I laid down for a year.

157,"2006-09-21",4.0,"Bottle. This is one of the finer porters I have encountered over the previous two years. This delight is suffciently complex to pass as a stout. Upon consumption, one immediately notes a distinct flavor of dark roasted coffee. There exists a burnt chocolate taste as well, which is superceded by the coffee. One would be flawed in noting that particular flavor as ""smokey."" While the color and flavor of the beer are not unlike that of a stout, the aroma somewhat lacks. One can sense the coffee, however, the beer must warm to nearly fifty five degrees before any smell is readily detected.

157,"2006-06-09",3.8,"Fullers Porter comes in somewhat of a faceless black bottle, a nearly invisible vessel devoid of any character assuming an equally bereft profile. Luckily, the contents tell a very different story. The habitual rich charcoal hue reminds of a Luddites nightmare, the oily cogs of machinery laboring to erect what in this case seems to be a sooty grey crown that emerges only to disappear as hastily. Smokey coffee and chocolate aromas develop to produce a delicious nose comforted by a dose of soothing cream, the perfect blend for contemplating ones own quenched empire while protected of the pluvious outdoors. The robust flavors of coffee, sausage and green vegetables gives substance to such a remarkable brew, that still caters to the softer palates with its velvety texture and lightly warming alcohol. Brilliantly depressing if youre joyous, but youll find nothing more consoling.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

157,"2006-05-01",4.3,"Dark red-brown to black with a significant, though fading dense head.   Upon cracking open the bottle, I was struck by the dark fruit fragrances, particularly of sweet prunes and figs.  Directly over my glass I notice dark rich malty molasses and the slightest bit of roasted coffee.  I can hardly remember drinking anything quite so smooth.  the carbonation is so soft leading to a delicate creaminess that few brews attain.  This smoothness is mirrored in the flavor profile.  Sweet dark fruits and gentle chocolate malts avail themselves with only the slightest bit of bitterness, eminating from a conservative floral hopping and a subtle charcoal roastiness.  A slight hint of lactic acid helps to balance this sweetness in fashion similar to colas.  The lingering flavors are first charcoal and then slowly coming back to those prunes and figs.  This is really a fabulous beer, and easily my favorite porter.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

Flavor is a burnt chocolate and a roasted coffee flavor with a slight inappropriate acetic/vinegar taste.  Hop bitterness really only a faint flavor in the profile.  Palate is lively and mostly smooth with a slight watery texture. Finally it finishes with a short and bitter-sweetness.  I really dont see the reall attractiion to this beer; it is a decent beer, but not overly interesting and not overly drinkable.

157,"2006-04-10",4.2,"10-Apr-06 (18.6 oz bottle: $2.89 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) Best before 03-Apr-05.  Having just sampled an aged Arcadia London Porter, I just had to put it up against a similarly-aged Fullers London Porter, even if it isnt bottle conditioned.  Its still sweet and wonderfully malty, but I noted a significant amount of chocolate when I tried this previously, and while still quite chocolaty, this is more raisiny and more earthy here, a plus in my book.  Roast isnt dominating and bitterness is fairly mild actually, so this just really allows other flavors to shine.  I really love that the smokiness emerges in the finish rather than just staying consistent right from the sip; adds complexity and more intrigue to the flavor this way.  Sweet, fruity, malty, chocolaty, smoky aroma is excellent.   Medium-full bodied and gently carbonated for an incredibly smooth and luxurious mouthfeel.  Medium ruddy-brown with some transparency through the center of the glass.  A full inch of creamy, light-tan head shows solid retention, taking several minutes to settle to a filmy layer.  Considerable patchy and ringed lacing decorates the glass.  This has to be one of the best porters available in the USA, and pasteurized or not, its permanently in my top ten for the style.06-Oct-04 (18.6 oz bottle) Very hearty and robust porter that boasts a strong chocolate flavor, lightly sweet, moderately roasted with a fair amount of bitterness and some smokiness in the finish.  Big, chocolate nose makes for a grand introduction for this beer.  Full bodied, with a creamy and smooth palate.  Dark ruddy brown in color.

Aroma is coffee, chocolate and a bit of creaminess, although points are deducted for my personal gag reflex against somewhat bitter coffee aromas (its a long story, and an irrational one, lets leave it at that).  First taste is kind of unimpressive - roastiness, coffee, chocolate.  The finish is where it develops its quality.  The finish sneaks up and has a very well developed roastiness and smokeyness to it that lasts quite a while.  Would be absolutely delicious with a steak.

S thick and creamy tan head leaves nice lacing as it crests the beer for the duration as a thin layer.  A strong roasted malt scent with some smokey hints prepares you for this quintessential Porter.  Faintly sweet upfront with more robust malt flavors dominating before a strong bitter finish reminiscent of coffee finishes leaving your mouth with a pleasant bitterness.

The aroma is complex and a perfect blend of chocolate malts, roasted malts and earthy hints of yeast and vanilla. The aroma is so delightful you will want to breathe it in often while enjoying this porter. The flavor is exquisite - mild coco wrapped in sweetness supported by roasted malts and coffee, finishing dry and clean with a slight bitterness. The mouth feel is very smooth and creamy yet without coating. A lingering aroma of chocolate malt and coffee finish off the delightful experience.

Funny thing is I have had this several times since I joined this fine community. Pours a genre defining near black color that is nonetheless brown. A lovely pungent aroma of coffee and chocolate assaults the nostrils with joy. Strong coffee flavors dominate this beer but a rich chocolate finish brings things back around in a lovely sweet fashion. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the lingering chocolate flavor is a delight long after the beer is finished. This is proof that a beer doesnt have to be loaded with alcohol to be rich and complex. A great beer that is fairly easy to find.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","Magjayran"

Flavor is a bit smoky, slight chocolate, and mildly bitter.    Not as much mocha or chocolate as wanted but everything is well balanced.  A finely made porter.  I could dig drinking this in a pub but i still like more ""aggressive"" porter like Gonzo or Stone.  Probably one of the cheapest 4.0+ beers, too, at $3 a for a 17oz bottle.

A decided note of plum and chocolate on the nose. Mouthfeel is fairly lush and creamy, and the 5.4 ABV is rather refreshing and makes the beer highly drinkable. Notes of semi-sweet chocolate, prune, and a hint of Jolly Rancher like sweetness. The chocolate overwhelms everything else; I really dont get too much coffee notes here.

When you taste it thats when it becomes a winner.  The mouthfeel is stunning - smooth and steady, and it seems to roll around your mouth of its own volition, hitting each taste zone as it goes.  As it goes down your throat it leaves characters of dark malt - the usual raisins, chocolate and coffee with a teeny bit of licorice.  But in the lingoring finish these all blend into a harmonious richness that leaves you wanting more.  This is a good un.

A nice husky grainy aroma. A touch of sourness, but at a good level. Lots of chewy dark bread flavor--leaves a pleasant lingering dry toast flavor, mingled with a little bright sourness and earthy chocolate. Medium body, enough to feel hearty, but not thick. Quality and character within the framework of restraint. 

(Rating from 8/15/2005, Falling Rock Taphouse, Denver) Very dark ruby with a smallish cap of head. Buttery-toffee aroma, with just a bit of roast. Buttery sweet flavor too, with a bit of sourness. Just a bit of burnt toast in the finish. A bit winey on the palate, but still fairly smooth. I had high hopes for this. Its unique, but not in particularly good ways.

Taste is chocolate, smoke, peat, malt, molasses, cherries and dark fruit.  A wonderfully complex flavor.  Mouth feel was flat but not too thin.  Reminds me of St. Peters Olde Style and Salopian Entire Butt, 2 porters I thoroughly enjoy.  Because its more of an old recipe style, meaning flat and sweet, it doesnt measure up to my Porter benchmark, Samuel Smiths Taddy, which is stronger, more carbonated, and fuller-bodied.  As far as Fullers goes, I still prefer their 1845 Ale.","Toledo, Ohio, USA","noelcb"

The taste is dry chocolate and roasted malts, but with an immediate chewiness in the mouth noticable even before swallowing.  Definately can taste the flavors that are in the nose.  The mouthfeel is what sold me on the perfection of this Porter.  I couldnt believe how creamy it was. My tongue was confusing it with the thickness or smoothness of melted butter.

157,"2005-01-11",3.9,"Bottle.  Got this one on trade from kaggie97, thanks Kevin!  Pours a dark cherry color with a nice thick head.  Not a jet black beer, but a deep black cherry with decent lacing.  Nose is awesome with raisins coming quickly, sweet and strong with coffee and burnt sugar.  This beer smells like those wonderful raisin cookies that my wifes Grandma Walters used to make with the sweet dough and raisins mixing wonderfully.  Body is medium, which surprised me a little as I expected more from it.  Little to no carb (its an English brew, what should I expect?) and I believe that is a fault.  Taste is of coffee sweetness when it hits the buds, then sort of slides into a coffee bitterness and a nice creaminess as it warms. You definitely need to let this one warm to a decent temp.  I was too eager... Beautiful long finish on the flavors, burnt malts and roasted bliss, but no real hop flavor.  Good overall taste, but Id like a little more hops.  What else is new?  Still a quality, kick ass porter.","Sligo","pjk33"

157,"2004-12-28",4.5,"Well, what can I say? This is quite simply one of the best beers available on a regular basis in Ontario, and is a fantastic beer by any measure. Whats even better is to be able to drink it on cask draft from Dora Keogh in Toronto. Its an amazing multitude of flavours - nuts, coffee, chocolate, malt, caramel.

157,"2004-12-27",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 12, 2014 Bottled.  Theres a lot of debate whether us British raters are more realistic when it comes to rating Fullers products (and Sam Smiths) and that raters elsewhere think the beers are better than they are.  I had this beer on cask many years ago and remember really enjoying it.  Ive looked for it on cask this Winter but to no avail, so I had to drink and rate the bottled version.  Well in my opinion the US raters and others have got this right.  It is a beautiful porter, full bodied, robust, call it what you want, but call it good (or even great).  It is black as night and has a short-lived off-white head and leaves no lacing.  The aroma is scrummy with loads of malts, lots of coffee and some chocolate.  Those qualities are replicated to better definition in the taste.  It is very full bodied, very flavoursome and very dark tasting.  Again coffee and burnt malts come through; together with a little chocloate.  An excellent drinking experience.  It doesnt matter that the beer is dead.  Hell, I would wager that a BC version would not be as good, given the general quality of most English BCAs.  This beer deserves its reputation on this site and its awards.  I will continue to look for it on cask in my Fullers light part of England.  Ive heard it sells for a ridiculous price in the trade and therefore pubs have to sell it at inflated prices, but it may just be worth it.  Score 4.4Subsequent ratings scored 3.8, 4.1 and 3.8.

The luscious aroma contained hints of dark fruit, plum, and rich coffee, but was most strongly reminiscent, in my opinion, of delicious buttery bread toasting in the oven.  Yum.  The flavor had all of the above and more; a sublime blend of dark chocolate, espresso, and roasted breadiness delivered in a delicately sweet package.  Full and creamy in the mouth.  A truly awesome beer, and most certainly my favorite porter to date.","Athens, Georgia, USA","jcc83"
157,"2004-08-25",4.4,"Bottle. Medium sized tan head and fine-medium sized bubbles. Mostly opaque, carbonated and a dark brown hue. Malty, caramel and roasted coffee aroma.

157,"2004-08-25",4.2,"Strong, roasted, pleasant aroma.  It pours very dark, almost opaque.  A thin tan creamy head sits nicely on top.  The initial taste is very complex, with flavors of caramel and chocolate dominating.  The body is rich, and the carbonation is slightly below-average.  The finish is bitter and on the strong side.  Not a beer for everyone, but definitely a wonderful porter.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"
157,"2004-08-23",4.2,"Dark brown, almost black. Roasty, chocolate nose. Flavour is coffee and roasted malts, a good juggling act here between sweet and bitter. Soft and smooth in the good way. Great beer. Bottle.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","nickchalk"
157,"2004-08-22",3.5,"From the bottle.  There was a substantial head upon the pour, and it dropped gradually to a creamy bed on top of the beer.  The colour is quite black, opaque for sure, with a slight hint of red.  The burnt aroma, supported with a sweetness,  is enticing.  It draws one in.  Palate is thin but creamy-feeling.  The carbonation is biting at first, but it mellows dramatically.  Flavour is expected for a porter...its a beer I can chew.  There are many flavours working all at once that I find myself pausing after each taste to take account of them all.  Porter could become my new favourite style aside from the fact that there is a poor representation in Ontario.  Ive brewed better porters but for the everyday consumer in Ontario, this one works.","Ontario, CANADA","DarkStar22769"

Rich roasted malt taste with chocolate and coffee bitterness.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","pintbypint"
157,"2004-08-19",2.2,"The London Porter pours a dark brown with ruby highlights.  It has a smallish brown head that quickly goes down to a thin film and then completely disappears.

Its aroma is chocolate and caramel malts and some dry, chalky toffee / butterscotch.

The flavor is acidic, bitter chocolate with some caramel malts and a strong butterscotch flavor.  The butterscotch became a little overwhelming as it warmed - both in flavor and aroma.  It has a chalky, slightly bitter finish.  It is thinner than I expected and under-carbonated.

Overall, I was expecting a lot from this, and was very disappointed.  Ive had much better porters.  I wonder if I had a bad bottle - it is 3 months before the best by date though.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"

There is no way on this earth this ale warrants a rating over 4---absolutely no way.  Its good, but only because its on the positive side of being close to average.  Theres definitely some good choco-coffee flavour but definitely sans the character that ALL of the best examples exhibit.

157,"2004-07-17",3.4,"Bottle: Pours to a dark ruby black color with a small tan head.  This porter has s rich, roasty aroma of coffee, dark chocolate, cereal, dark fruit, raisins and honey.  The aroma is not very pungent.  At the first smell, Im not really expecting much in the way of assertive taste.  But man does that change when I go ahead and drink this beer.  The first sip explodes in my mouth with unsweetened dark chocolate (chocolate malt) and tingling carbonation.  This is quickly followed by coffee and slight bitterness from the fuggles hops.  The dark chocolate malts come through again in the finish with their roasty bitter chocolate flavors.  This is an excellent porter, no doubt about it though Id love to try it on draught because I think itd be better.  My bottle seemed to have a little too much carbonation compared to other ratings.

Opaque brown/black color, wonderful roasted malt aroma and flavor, perhaps overpowering the hops a bit. I cant even begin to list the different aromas youll get out of this one, and I think it will be different each time depending on where you are, what else you can smell and what youre eating.

The Flavour explodes with Nuts, Freshly Ground Coffee Beans, and some Woody, Earthy overtones. The Flavour never lets up and finishes delightfully round and sweet. This Brew is Malty, and roasty at that, but not too hoppy insofar as I can decipher, and therefore a true example of this style.There also exist abundant Lacing on the Glass.

157,"2004-07-03",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2005 This is really an outstanding porter because of the sheer number of flavors that work their way out to your tastebuds.  It pours almost black - but not quite - and some ruby shows around the edges of the glass.  The nose is big and pleasant.  The head is as creamy, thick, and lasting as one could ask for.  Then theres taste:  Theres the fruity hoppiness (often hidden by the ""burnt-ness"" of porters), coffee, chocolate, toffee, roasted flavors.  None of the flavors are out of balance.  Most of them share equal time.  This beer is either simple in a complex way or complex in a simple way.  Either attribute is a very positive one.  A true classic among porters and beers in general.

157,"2004-06-23",3.4,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2008 Medium brown hue with a tall, frothy, light tan head that has a scattering of larger bubbles.  Licorice, earthy tones such as peat, near burnt popcorn and some butter all come across first and with great force.  Oaky, dry, tannic as well.  Oddly, I get some iodine as well.  The hell?  Is this a porter or an Islay single malt?  OK, no, the similarities arent strong to the point of confusion, but they are definitely present.  Chocolate, light coffee, prunes and dates along the lines of more typical porter aromas.  The flavour begins fairly sweet and tangy (like milk chocolate and salted butter mixed together) with a light nuttiness.  Mid-palate finds a tinge of soft acidity and wanders into a still sweet finish with the illusion of dryness through  roasted malts and perhaps some tannins.    Buttery elements have all but disappeared at this point, but the odd peat and iodine aromas still lurk in the background.  An unfortunate dose of soy sauce crops up with significant warmth.  Perhaps its a bit papery, too.  The texture is a bit watery, carbonation soft...feels a little under medium-bodied.  Somehow pleasant on the surface, but there are a lot of aromas sneaking around that Im not to terribly fond of at the moment. 50cl bottle, bbe 17/08/08.

Pint bottle, goblet.  Chocolate, coffee, wheat bread malt (M); dry, floral hops (L); oak, butter, smoke, prune aromas.  Deep purple body with a creamy, tan, lasting head.  Moderately sweet, moderately acidic flavor becomes a moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter finish.  Lingering coffee aftertaste.  Medium body, oily/watery texture, average carbonation.

157,"2004-05-13",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 1, 2005 You dirty brits...you make my mouth happy. Great brew. This rating will be a little skewed because this was tasted after a series of beers over 8%. However, the parts I remember were retarded. Nice head and lovely lacing. Dark dark black. Looks more like charcoal water than beer. Smells excellent. If yuo have ever had a Belgian beer on tap you will notice that the beer has a very distinctive chalky yeasty flavor and not the full and fruity flavor that it has in the bottle. This beer also has that. Smells flat and chalky. Tastes exquisite.Round and robust, however the roastiness of the malt is exceedingly rounded over by the flat yeasty flavors that predominate. This is brew reminds me of Anchors porter, only with a much more rich mouthfeel. Give it a shot youll like it I promise.

Phenomal beer worthy of its praise.","Lancaster, California, USA","Sven"

Ratebeerwise this should be in the mid range, but I just love it so much theres no way to rate it lower. I apologoze to the fine Englishmen who dislike Fullers pub strategies (for good reasons), but when they put the porter in a bottle or can and send it abroad, they are onto something...","Odense, DENMARK","Christian"

157,"2004-03-24",4.0,"Wheee!  I'm impressed!  Dark brew, thick but kinda fizzy head that dissipates after a few minutes.  Bold, yet non-bitter chocolate taste with a nice bite.  Rich and full flavor.  I'm very impressed with Fuller's beers that I've had.  This is an exceptional job - one of the best I've had from this style.  The brewers managed to put a lot of flavor into this beer without going overboard on the sweetness and smokey flavors that you find in most porters.  Nothing here is blown out of proportion.  It's just very nice!  I wish  I hadn't passed it up on all of those occasions.  In the process of becoming a hop-head who loves a good IPA, I've forgotten how good  a properly engineered maltier beer can be.","Illinois, USA","zborgerd"
157,"2004-03-23",4.6,"This is an example of a brew that excels in its said style without all the acrobatics. Pours a deep charcoal with ruby highlights when light hits. Conservative head but leaves a nice ocean water lace thereafter. Nose is of chocolate and dates, with smoke overtones busting through like a bonfire at the beach. Tastes of coffee bean, with the strength of expresso, bit of semi-sweetened chocolate and a buttery-smooth middle. Finishes with blanket of smoke on the back of the tongue. Nice solid medium mouthfeel, leaves this another winner from Fuller's. Classy, sexy and seductive and enough brains to keep you interested for time to come. I'm marrying this one.","Long Beach, California, USA","zen"

Very pleasing aromas of chocolate, roast malts, a woody aroma as well, maybe oak, and the Fuggles come through a bit. A slight hint of caramel in there, too. Chocolate malts dominate the flavors followed by the caramel and roasted malts. There is almost a coffee like character there along with that oak that was in the aroma. Nice and creamy palate, thick, rich body and a wonderful chocolate filled bitter finish. This is a damn fine example of a porter, and I'm extremely happy it's available here again.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Sham"
157,"2004-03-16",4.6,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2007 Theres a dearth of Baltic porter in Canada now so I decided to try some of the British offerings so I got six Fullers at the local. I cant say I like it as much as the sweeter, fuller bodied, stronger Baltic porters but this is a very good example of the traditional British porter and a superbly produced beer with excellent quality. Im quite satisfied with this as an interim substitute.

This impressive embossed  bottle had a freshness date and write up on the beers  awards. Poured a luxurious rich clear dark mahogany looks almost cola- ruby when glass held against a strong light. Large cascading puffy brown head that stayed for a while then dissipated to a beige lace that stayed to the end of the drink. It has a moderate amount of effervescence .

Smells of chocolate and Caramel with hints of wine-like berry. 

Starts rather sharp to the tongue accented with dry hops and carbonation then builds into a creamy medium-full bodied mouth feel punctuated with a balance of musty chocolate semi sweetness and  hops...finishes  smooth  with a pleasant dry-cocoa after taste that is not as tinny as dry stouts. All in all a very good drink and a fine porter.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"

157,"2004-02-27",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 19, 2007 (Bottled) Very dark reddish brown with a large, beige and foamy head. Quite strong, a bit earthy aroma of roasted malt, lots of  coffee, salty licorice and hints of smoke. Burned-roasted-malty flavor with smooth dark coffee, and a sweetish-malty breeze in the middle. The finish is roasted and slightly ashy with medium bitterness. Very smooth, medium to full-bodied palate with soft carbonation. Definitely one of the best British brews. Truly excels in achieving a perfect balance between sweet maltiness and ashy burnedness, while being low-ABV and enough earthy-licoricey to be interesting flavorwise.","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"

Tastes of some light fruity sweetness, roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate, a little bit more sourness, a touch of hops.  Pleasing bitter finish.  Mildly carbonated, and a little  watery in the mouth.

Perhaps I pulled it out of the refrigerator too soon, as I think it would be better served colder. Luckily I have 5 more to try.

157,"2003-12-10",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 17, 2004 This is a rock solid Porter and stands on top of the Porter hill for a reason.

It pours a beautiful midnight black w/a good head, if a little thin with bigger bubbles than I'd expect and a bit weak on the lacing but that's just nit picking.

Taste is a pleasure from the moment it hits your tongue. No harsh hop attack here, the bitterness only serves to compliment the fruit and roast undertones. It starts smooths and only gets smoother as it works it's way across you pallette. The finale is great with hints of an alcohol warmness (supprising for it's average ABV) that finishes the movement.

Overall I'd highly remcommend this porter for any porter lover. This is one that even a Porter neophyte could love, not overly challanging but deep and complex.

A thick light brown head tops this fairly clear beer, which is dark brown in color with ruby notes as it is held up to the light.  This beer has an incredible creamy mouthfeel to it.  It is lightly sweet with a roast character in the finish.  There is a very good balance between the roast character and the fruit notes.

Overall, a pleasant easy drink, but fairly light and thin. Not as sweet in the bottle as I thought on tap. I have had this on tap and am not as impressed as I once was. Still a light body, but it has a sweet note that distracts and it is fairly thin its body. Old rating follows. Nice light porter. Best I have had in a bottle. Nice balanced and complex flavor. Has some roasted noted and a nice woody feel. A dry coffee finish complements the solid beer. Would love to try this on tap.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
157,"2003-11-09",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2004 This impressive beer is obviously brewed using magic. I imagine a wizard in some London castle churning the stuff out from bubbling cauldrons. Had it on tap and was impressed by the thick, creamy head. I think that if left alone the head may have lasted forever. And don't even get me started on the perfect coffee color of this magnificant brew. Alright, if I seem a little over excited let me just explain that this was the first porter I have experienced on draught and until now I have not understood the true potential of a porter. I am already a big stout fan though so I can cetainly appreciate the chocolate malt flavor  and the rich malt aroma that acompanies this beer but what I was not expecting was the perrfectly balanced crisp hops finish. That finish dazzled and delighted me like few beers every have. This is a beer that knows what it is doing and does it very well. I think the greatest single aspect of this beer is the way it matures in the glass. With every sip it seems to evolve, to develop deeper and more meaningful complexity. I understand from the buddy who shared this experience with me that this beer might take some time to grow on you. I say, if you are going to let anything grow on you let it be Fullers London Porter.","Sarasota, Florida, USA","DKlovesbeer"

Roasty bitterness comes through in the finish, with a light lingering dryness...Body is moderately full, and the layering of flavors really stimulates the palate while delivering this rich bounty with an elegant smoothness...This is extremely satisfying---one of the best from this outstanding brewery.","Des Moines, Washington, USA","KingPinHead"

157,"2003-10-28",4.3,"Poured out of 18.6 oz. bottle, bought at Liquorama in Upland, CA 10/5/03.  Pours a silky-looking dark cola brown with a hint of red.  Sudsy, beige head that lingers.  Clear body but so dark that very little light passes through it.  Aroma is malty deliciousness-- creamy, caramelly, smells a lot like a box of Cracker Jacks.  A little too soft for my liking, but still very alluring.  Taste is immediately of dark roasted malts and some nuttiness.  Dark malt flavors grow and grow, having just enough sweetness on the back end to keep it tasty.  Whereas many porters make me think, ""Ok, this is good, but it should've been a stout,"" this one is a truly definitive and unique kind of beer.  Not as much like a  coffee or espresso as most other stouts and porters; it has a whole 'nother thing going on.  Obviously shares some similarities with a good stout, but this doesn't feel like it's any sort of compromise at all.  Active carbonation and even some acidity in the mouthfeel; thin-to-medium body but interesting texture, almost chewy and oily at the same time.  Long finish with nuttiness, bitterness, and mellowing maltiness, as well as a hint of sourness that grows.  Very complex stuff, revealing new layers with each sip and second of its taste.  For me, this beer at once defines and transcends its style.  Special, special stuff.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

There is something in this porter that sets it apart from all others.  My originial thought is the brown malt or maybe the blend between the grains is in perfect balance.

Taste starts with sweet cream, then grows more complex adding a variety of chocolate flavors (sweet, milk & bittersweet), then roastiness and coffee. Aftertaste is also delectable with more chocolate, coffee, pit fruits, hickory and nutmeg. This is a very complex beer, but never overwhelming.

The hops start out bitter in the front and built during the middle only to fade into the finish and linger for a bit afterwards. A bit of burned bread is dominate in the middle of the flavor and while I'd be surprised if smoked malt is part of the mash, something's making me think of a campfire.

Feel is medium to thin in abundance, no real richness or heftyness to be found for my idea of a robust porter. Its a solid porter by many means and quite a good drinker, I was hoping for more though.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
157,"2003-07-01",3.2,"UPDATED: SEP 16, 2004 Pours a very dark garnet. Foamy head with a good bit of splotchy lacing. Nose is slightly bitter with a light touch of chocolate.

157,"2003-06-14",3.4,"UPDATED: MAR 17, 2004 Rave reviews for this beer? I don't understand it. Are we talking about the same beer? I wrote the name down when I tried it, so yes. True this is a complex beer, but it tastes like something I don't like - hard liquor. It tastes like they literally put hard liquor in it. Bleh. If I want hard liquor I will go and drink that, but I want beer. Overall, the taste is overpowering and repulsed my taste buds. My beer connossieur friend Travis also agreed that it was not a good beer. This beer, along with Hoegaarden and Blue Moon of Kentucky is a beer I have no desire to drink again.

Let's re-cap. The aroma is beerish, but misleading since it doesn't really taste like beer. The appearance is the best thing about it, for it looks good. The flavour however tastes of whiskey and the palate of chocolate and coffee. My overall impression is very negative on this one. I really don't think it deserves a 99 rating. Second rating: The first rating was unfair. This beer tastes better at a slightly warmer temperature, which brings out its enjoyable porter attributes more and somehow makes it seem smoother. Still not deserving of a 99, but quite good and tryworthy.","Birmingham, Alabama, USA","DerBiermeister"

It had a great aroma of caramel, toasty, burnt sugar and coffee. In the flavor it had much of the same plus some nice fruitiness and a compexity that is hard to describe. I think burnt marshmallow was in there. It had enough roasted grain and hops to keep the sweeter tendencies under control. It was smooth and full of body and had a nice mouthfeel.

Its pours a generally black color into the glass with an occassional ruby spot here and there in the light with a small, not long lasting dark tan head. The aroma is chocolate malts, roasts and molasses. The taste is very silky in its chocolate malt approach. Nothing of an overbearing chocolate attack, but more like a coating...thin, yet fullfilling and round. Very little carbonation, just roasted malt, and a whole bunch of care and a great recipe.

Theres a nice balance in this I cannot articulate, but I will say that its not too sweet.

Dark with a thick, too thick creamy hot chocolate head that soon settles--the first whiff reveals that this is a robust porter--one with a sharp coffee and chocolate aroma that is perfect--absolute heaven--and concealing in a tantalizing manner the initmation of alcohol. The smoky, roasted flavor is amorphous and sharp (black patent malt proliferation??)

157,"2002-10-01",3.2,"UPDATED: APR 25, 2012  Oct, 2002. This is a pleasantly smooth and rich chocolate stout - bags of flavour but without much character. All the dark malt flavours are there, and its nice, but theres an oomph missing. [3.1] 
May, 2003. Good chocolate and firm but gentle roasted malts. Very good mouthfeel. Alcohol warmth beyond its strength. Smooth. It does lack an edge, but is a very palatable brew. [3.6]
Oct, 2004 Got this as part of Fullers Autumn Beers pack at Waitrose in Portsmouth. And its a very attractive beer which accompanied a soup very well. It has the roasty, chocolate, coffee notes of a dark beer, such as a stout or porter, though it is sweeter than average, and with a soft, almost creamy mouthfeel. Certainly attractive, though not outstanding or World Class in any sense except reputation. The beer is clearly dead - there is no life in the liquid. It flows across the palate in a very limp manner. The soft sweetness is more inclined to American tastes than British (which would account for poor sales here in the UK, while the bulk of production goes to America). I can understand people liking this on a personal level, but its not, and can never be, a good example of craft beer - regardless of style. [3.0]
January 2009 500ml bottle from Sainsburys. Its been a while since I had this beer. I do like dark beers, and this one is pleasant enough.  Theres a decent range of flavours - blackcurrant, ash, butter, soap, etc. Its quite hop bitter for a dark beer - usually the bitter flavours come mainly from the dark roast, but this has a considerable hop bitterness. Just a little too bitter and serious for my taste. The more I drink this the less I really enjoy it. The first few swallows were better than the later ones as this builds in the mouth. Its certainly a robust beer. I like the bottle, and the sober authority of the label, but the beer itself, doesnt impress. [ 2.8]
April, 2012 500ml bottle from Sainsburys. A nose rich in dark malty flavours - burnt toffee prominent. Pleasant mouthfeel - gentle, almost natural carbonation. Flavours feel fresh and natural as the pasteurising process doesnt impact on dark beers as much as pale. Theres an initial creamy toffee and coffee flavour, soft and attractive, then the bitterness, the cinders and ashes gently come through to provide interest and balance. Very drinkable, very pleasant, and very enjoyable. Perhaps too much bitter ash in the finish, lingering too long, but overall a decent little beer.

157,"2002-09-29",3.9,"Best porter ever. This was a hard sell for me as Im not big on the style, but this was impressing. Nose was like licorice and heavy malts.

157,"2002-09-26",4.2,"This is terribly complex.  In one six pack, I had the following experiences: the first had this tremendous (and welcome) chargrill taste with coffee in the back; the second bottle was coffee up front, with one of the longest finishes imaginable, the coffee unfolding and showing so many different sides; on the third bottle, I experienced sweet vanilla and chocolate milk shake flavors dried out marvelously by the darker grain astringency.  Each had a remarkable mouthfeel--I think the perfect viscosity for the style.  I cant wait to see what the other 3 bottles will be like.","Annapolis, Maryland, USA","urbnhautebourg"
157,"2002-09-26",3.8,"I think that I may have had an old bottle of this because it didnt appeal to me like it seems to appeal to everyone else.

157,"2002-09-25",3.8,"Loved the deep, deep red colour of this brew. Strong aroma of black roast malt reminiscent of a heavy stout. Upon first tasting, quite bitter, strong mocha flavour too, mellows to a more chocolatey sensation mid-palate with lingering bitterness. Unfortunately this beer doesnt have a great deal of body, as evidenced by the rather fragile head, its smooth as milk but quite thin. Goes  well with full cream vanilla ice cream and rich chocolate sauce. Thanks Dogbrick.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Linc"
157,"2002-09-23",4.7,"This really is a great beer.  Definitely should not be served too cold, as the taste gets MUCH better as it approaches room temp.

Although coffee and chocolate delightfully infiltrate the flavor, this beer seems less full-bodied to me than I once thought. The finish is more dry/bitter than I remember too.

157,"2002-07-11",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2004 Yeah! This is one of the best beers I've ever had. Sweet, rich, chocolate, roasted taste. The taste got even better as the beer got warmer. Beautiful head/lace, and dark dark dark brown appearance. Perfect carbonation. Perfect blend/balance of flavors. The tastes worked together without any individual one overpowering the others.

I hit the jackpot when Andy's North Campus sent an e-mail that they had cases of this for $11.99. Excellent roasted aroma with hints of chocolate. Rich, dark color with a thin head. Hearty coffee/chocolate flavor that neither dissipated nor overpowered. One of the best beers I have tried.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
157,"2002-07-11",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 24, 2006 Bottle. Deep Red-Mahogany color. Short, Burnt Off-white head that disappears fairly rapidly.  Sweet chocolate, plum/raisin aroma.  Initial taste is a rich, chocolate flavor with very even dark roast coffee undertones that strike with a not-too-bitter pleasant appeal.  As it goes down has a caramel/hop taste that hits the back of the palate, providing for a full English ale flavor.  Finish has a roasted-copper appeal that lingers, with nutty overtones as it warms.  Carbonation is not a problem in the bottle.  Best Porter out there? Quite possibly.  Make this stuff unpasteurised and unfiltered and Id give it a perfect score.Nitro draught Blah, this was pretty bad, the roastiness shows through, but in a sickly sweet/sour way, with dry chocolate and a weak body, per nitro.  Wont be rating this sample, as this stuff was not meant to be on nitro.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

It created a wonderful dark tan head, but it failed to hold, but that may have been due to the temperature I had it chilled at. The taste is good, with elements of chocolate, coffee and perhaps toffee. The finish is good, it a little lighter than I like for this style.

Jeez, this is a chocolate malt for adults. Great look, flavor, mouthfeel. Fans of bitterness will regret the lack of a bitter finish, but appropriately, the finish is sweet, tangy and clean.

My wife bought a bottle to use in making an onion gravy, since she recalled that the recipe called for some kind of alcohol (it actually called for a sweet wine!).

Rich aroma including glimpses of candied fruit, chocolate, molasses, malt, coffee and cough medicine but all with minimum sweetness. Medium bodied and quite a delicate and satisfying bitter-sweet balanced palate.

157,"2001-09-26",3.2,"UPDATED: OCT 24, 2013 The chocolatiest of porters.  Not as good as I remember during my impressionable  years ten or so years ago.  Lots of toffee and fruitcake flavors.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
157,"2001-09-24",4.6,"Poured with a thick, tenacious tan head.  Mildly sweet, roasted aroma.  Tons of dark coffee and a hint of dark chocolate.  Finished with a firm mocha bitterness.  Very substantial, yet for all the body it was not heavy.  A benchmark for the style.","Bowling Green, Kentucky, USA","Brent"

157,"2001-07-22",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 6, 2006 July 2001:  The heavenly chocolate/toffee aroma could be a bit more pronounced, and the flavor is if anything a tiny bit too smooth; otherwise, a near-perfect brew that reminds me of why I fell in love with porters in the first place.  Following on the heels of an Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock, this has been one of my top beer nights ever!  The majority IS right when this beer is concerned. 9/5/9/5/19 4.7

March 2006, 330 ml bottle from Julios Liquors in Westboro, MA (February 2006).  Little pop to the cap but near-perfect pour, with a largish lasting fine-bubbled soft brown head atop a slightly viscous deep brown body....VERY light almost nonexistent nose, touch of grass and touch of chocolate  -- as it warms, touches of burnt caramel and chocolate arrive, but it never really becomes distinctive....Chocolaty, balanced roasty-sweet body, light woodiness and grain, dark chocolate and espresso, some nice earth-tones emerge along with a bit of vanilla as it warms....quite smooth, somewhat lifeless but lightly sticky body, reasonably full.  

This is one of those early favorites that stuck around my top 10-20 list for my first five years on the site, and as its never been available in VT, I never bothered to re-rate it.  Still solid for a mainstream, pasteurized product coming from England, this is no longer a great beer in my estimation; whether it has truly lost some lustre in the past half-decade, or its just my tastes that have changed, I cant say.  Current rating is for this recent sample.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

157,"2001-01-24",3.9,"Good - smelled enticing, initial pour - exciting - however head died to a set of larger bubbles quickly.  Lacked the silky mouthfeel that I have come to expect from porter - taste was a nice roasty finish - aftertaste was slightly overdone - all-in-all a good brew, top 5 but well behind Anchor and Samuel Smiths porters.","Palm Beach Gardens, FL, Florida, USA","blatz"
157,"2000-12-15",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2004 Impossibly chocolatey aroma with lighter notes of roasty espresso and date.  Dark brown color, clear, with a lasting, creamy head.  Semi-sweet chocolate also dominates the flavor profile, which becomes roasty and develops hints of caramel and nut towards the finish.  Medium body.  Bubbly mouthfeel, moreso than I recall from samplings gone by.  Certainly very tasty, and seemingly possessed of class as well.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

157,"2000-10-27",4.1,"A definite global top 5 Porter. Full chocolate malt aroma and body; dark ruby red color; smooth mouthfeel with a mild Fuggles hop presence. I still lean to Sam Smiths Taddy, but this is right up there.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"
157,"2000-09-16",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2005 Near black colour.  Chocolatey, vaguely nutty aroma.  Fairly sweet, milk chocolatey flavour.  Only a hint of roast.  Moderate body, hint of earthiness.  Finishes with some chewy, molassesy accents in the chocolate.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
157,"2000-06-05",4.5,"A great porter - and close to being definitive
for the style.  Rich, with caramel and chocolate
flavors, with just a hint of hop bitterness.
Nicely balanced.  Medium bodied and opaque black.
If youre looking for a good porter, look no further.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
