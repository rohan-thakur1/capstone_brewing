210,"2017-01-30",4.0,"Crystal golden with a white head. Extremely clean profile. Light toasted malt profile with a crisp light hops. Finishes with light bitterness. A very clean beer. Very light flavor throughout but a very refreshing and enjoyable beer.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
210,"2016-12-26",4.1,"Bomber. Brilliant mostly clear golden-yellow color with a lasting white head and mind-blowing lacing. The aroma is excellent, nice, crisp, hoppy, grass, straw, bread. Flavor has a nice touch of sugar/honey sweetness, yielding to an extremely crisp bitter hoppiness. Incredibly crisp feel. This is what a kolsch should be. Best Ive ever had in this style, so even though the style is boring, Im not afraid to give it a high rating.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
210,"2016-11-21",3.0,"UPDATED: DEC 17, 2016 From bottle its mostly clear gold with a thin head. Quiet aroma is toasted rice, floral hops, minerals, fabric / chemicals. In the mouth its light bodied and sweet and bubbly, clean but a little brash, lacking the body and savoriness of the Pils, and not offering much aromatically. 082316 bottling.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
210,"2016-11-18",4.5,"WBeautiful light and floral aromas of fermented grains. Slightly hazy golden lasting thin head. Great hay grows into a smooth full cereal grain. Big wheaty mouth feel.","truckee, California, USA","krumbum"
210,"2016-10-04",3.2,"Tasting at MattsHazy blond color, dull, it pours with no head. Grass and hay aroma. Quite nice flavor of cereals, malt, hay, some hay, with a finish of herbaceous hops.Nice.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
210,"2016-10-02",3.1,"Bottle. Pours hazy golden, medium white head, dissipates quickly, nice residual and decent lacing. Aroma is grass, grain, hints of bread. Flavor is light sweetness, medium bitter, grassy, a bit harsh. Light plus body. Not my favorite. Overly bitter for style IMO.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
210,"2016-10-02",4.0,"(Bouteille provenant du Bottlecraft): Une belle rondeur accompagné dune verdure permanente, tout léger sulfure et une bonne amertume. Pas aussi étincelant quanticipé mais une belle surprise machabilité.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
210,"2016-09-28",3.1,"650ml bottle, pours a hazy yellow colour. Nose is slightly sweet, and hops. Flavour earthy, herbal hops.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiery_1"

210,"2016-09-28",3.3,"500mL bottle, pours a hazy golden orange with a small white head. Aroma is rather fruity, with lager yeast and bready malt. Flavour is rather dry, with cereal, biscuity malt, and lager yeast. Not a typical kolsch, with a much maltier, sweeter base. Despite this, much more interesting than the typical kolsch.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
210,"2016-09-28",2.5,"The colour is a touch dark - darker straw - and has a bit of haze. So it looks all wrong. The aroma has a heavy nose - sort of a wet cabbage and doughy pale malts. Doughy on the palate as well, without nearly enough bitterness to be in the style. Its sweet, its musty, and all told is nothing like a kolsch.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
210,"2016-08-30",3.7,"Pours clear yellow with a white head. The aroma had lightly sweet dough, spicy hops and lush caramel for the style. It has a medium body with mild carbonation. The taste has much drier malt, dried earthy herbal hops and dried leaves. Pretty tasty.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
210,"2016-08-06",3.9,"On tap in Portland. Pours cloudy gold with a nice off-white head and a toffee aroma. There is a hearty mixed malt flavor, moderately bitter from German-style hopping, probably Saaz since Spalt is hard to find. Genuine Kolsch characteristics.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
210,"2016-07-29",4.1,"22 oz. bottle as ""Das Bier"".
$4.99 from Roths Sunnyslope Market in Salem OR
Pours an ever so slightly hazy golden colour with a small frothy off white head..that goes fast but leaves attractive lace,]
Aroma of golden cereal, bread and a slight earthiness.
Taste similar but with the faintest of grassy hop at the end to the mouthful. Very smooth.
Amazing mouth feel they just got the body and carbonation spot on for style..making for tremendous drink-ability.
This is an amazing kolsch...wish it were in cans.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"

210,"2015-08-25",3.7,"On tap at Mongers. Pours a clear orange color with a medium white head. A big sweet fruity nose, biscuit, some honey. Light soft toffee, sweet bready base, oranges, marmalade. Good.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
210,"2014-11-13",3.8,"On tap at Trappist Provisions. It pours a golden color with a dense white head. The aroma is light lemon candy and florals with soft notes of pale malt. The flavor is floral with some lemongrass and crackery malt with a snappy lemony, floral and lightly acidic finish. It has a super soft and creamy mouthfeel that feels elegant on the palate. Super nice stuff.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
