2005,"2017-05-20",4.5,"Dark brown, big tan head, lacing. Aroma of strong coffee, pungent, almost peppery. Coffee is the dominant flavour too, and its good coffee! It goes along with roasted malts, chocolate, nuts, some citrus notes, peppery spicy. Well balanced between sweet and bitter, it presents a medium body, creamy feel, soft carbonation and a long finish. Outstanding!","HONG KONG","colui72"
2005,"2017-04-26",3.9,"Bomber from the Woodland CostCo. Pours brown with a large creamy/foamy tan head. Aroma is rather spicy coffee. Med body or better. Flavor is lightly spicy coffee, some smooth roasted malt, and maybe a touch of something like citrus. Theres a bitterness that even burns a bit. Not dry, but the bitterness is enough to make that tolerable. Browns not my fave, but this one is good enough to be a fave.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

2005,"2017-04-15",3.8,"Bomber from hayduke that we had together via facebook chat. Dark brown pour that has a two plus fingers of beige foam. all kinds of coffee in the aroma. It is rich and earthy but not over roasted. That translates to the flavor, too. Some light fruity bitterness pops in and is a nice offset. It is also lightly herbal. The coffee is surprisingly complex. A little toffee, a little citrus, a lot of earth. That coffee is in charge, though. Very good stuff.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
2005,"2017-04-15",3.8,"Shared with Strykzone of Facebook Chat. From a bomber poured amber down with a large and long lasting off-white that left good lacing. Nose of coffee, rich roasted malts, and some fruit. Medium plus body. Flavor is rich and while coffee is dominate the fruit and chocolate mats support it.

Has some nice roasted malts, a hint of chocolate covered orange, and a touch of spice. The coffee is quite pronounced on the tongue as well. Kind of reminiscent of one of those sweetened coffee drinks. Just a hint of bitterness to it on the finish. Its fine.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2005,"2017-01-24",3.5,"Bottle at home. It pours a dark brown/amber color with a frothy, khaki head. The aroma has strong roasted coffee without much malt character. Maybe some light toast. The flavor is also very strong with coffee with a hint of syrup and peppery bitterness. A little dark fruit. Good, not great.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
2005,"2017-01-19",3.3,"Tap. Copper color with tan ring. Aroma is aromatic coffee, dark malts. Taste is coffee, coffee, coffee. Medium soft carbonation, soft oily mouthfeel. Great beer, but one-dimensional. The coffee is very prominent. But then again, Brown Ale is a subtle style, so when you load it with coffee, youre gonna load it with coffee.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","SinH4"
2005,"2017-01-13",3.7,"Bottle from city beer San Fran. Lots of dark roast coffee that shines right through. Almost a vegitable flavor. Bit of citrus from the coffee notes and toffee from the malt in the brown ale base. Not bad.","seattle, Washington, USA","cobaink2"
