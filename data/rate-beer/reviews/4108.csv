Aroma: The aroma is of this one is pretty tart, plenty of vinegar, and some sour fruit

Appearance: Pours a murky reddish-orange color with a decent off-white head

Flavor: Flavor-wise, it has lots of sour fruity and tartness, vinegar, much like the nose

Palate: The body is medium, with an acidic/sulphur kind of feel, and a tart/sour finish

The aroma is acetic sour, very strong, approaching vinegar. There is some fruit character as well, orange, berry, apples. The taste is mouth puckering sour, really shockingly so - its acetic vinegar, sharply so. As with the nose, after the sour settles in, there is apple cherry fruit, earth, and general funkiness. The palate is medium bodied, close to still carbonation and the earth funky sour finish. Pretty over the top, and not at all nuanced.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

4108,"2014-06-05",3.3,"Draft at Hopleaf, 4/19/14Bright orange with some softer banana-yellow hues in there and a wispy white head that is quick to recede to the edges. Clarity is fairly high while carbonation is only lightly perceptible.Some vegetal notes, as others point out, are notable in the nose, detracting somewhat, I guess, though there is healthy dose of lactic acid and plenty of ""funk"" to it mostly in the form of farm animal poop (sulphur). Lots of fruitiness with green apples, cherries and even a touch of citrus helping to lighten the mood a bit while the malt seems mostly attenuated from the nose. Medium to medium-high strength of aroma with no alcohol, thankfully and while you may wish for a more brett-laden nose, Im perfectly happy with this one.Lactic sourness washes over the palate, initially, as some malt sugars announce themselves as not being fully attenuated (though its far from sweet), lending a little bit of strength to the body. Incredibly low carbonation, though what is there is rather tight/engaging, helping to cast the sourness about while removing the sweetness. Lots of the fruitiness (esters) from the nose, with just a touch of rotting fruit (acetic) notes, though I found no where near the level that some others mention. Plenty of sulphur, lacto and just a hint of brett on the very end. No alcohol in the flavor either.Sure, this is no top notch lambic, but come on, the fact that Elgoods, what I can only see (from the database) as being a wholly mediocre brewery, produced this, is quite impressive. Certainly wouldnt run out of my way to drink it, but would be happy to drink again if it was one of the few sours on tap.

Frothy whitish head dissipates to skant ring that doesnt really lace at all atop. Aromas are a bit sour, lemony lactic elements meet a gentle funk, bready malts touch citrus, touches of orange and cobwebs, gentle vanilla meets touches of green apple, some stone fruit and yogurt. Initial is lighter end of the fold in body offering a bit less than the nose was preaching, a bit muddled as bready malts meet tart fruit, touches of citrus, gentle lactic acidity. Mellow bread and gentle dusty cobwebs taper into a sweeter fruity middle, touches of earth and bretty dryness kick a but more into the backend. A bit dry and earthy, as the sourness kicks up a bit more as we finish. Some gentle white wine, sour apple and lemon. A touch sweet in the middle but overall a serviceable offering.
