2470,"2015-05-14",2.7,"April 2014 bottle drunk late Summer 2014The thing finally dropped ""clear"" after about 2 months in the fridge. And by clear I mean lightly hazy. Though thats better than cloudy as all hell. Just remember kids, you too can clarify your IPAs if you just let them sit at the bottom of a cold fridge for a long time....I think my Trillium Congress St and Mosaic Fort Point are just about at the one month mark and neither are showing any signs of dropping. Playin hard ball eh hop particulates? Well I bet you didnt count on me aging you in my fridge for 3 more years! Ha, thatll teach these pesky IPAs. No just kidding, Ill drink them soon, cloudy or no. So back to this beer, but still on the subject of cloudy IPAs, I really do believe it strongly impacts the flavor. Have I had some incredible IPAs/DIPAs that were cloudy? Absolutely. At some point, a well-brewed, knowledgeably-hopped IPA is going to taste/smell amazing regardless of the hop sediment. Would it taste even better if it was bright? Yep. The problem is, on a beer such as ABCS, which, while wonderfully hopped with all sorts of tropical fruit, citrus and pine, is also HEAVILY acidic. The sediment works against the overall brightness of the hop flavors, which in turn displays the acid/resin even more than it normally would be. The very slight nuttiness/blandness from the particulates (and in some cases, diritiness, though not here) also knock down the head formation/retention (for whatever thats worth).That all being said, this beer is just too alcoholic (even at 7.5%) and brutally acidic for me to enjoy. Yes, its got lots of crystal malt imparting that lovely iced tea like flavor that you know and [dont] love, with a malty texture, but even the malt is probably overattenuated to where it needs to be to begin to balance this beast.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
2470,"2014-08-27",4.1,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.

The color is a bright orange/gold with two fingers of foamy white head and good amount of lacing is left on the glass.

The smell has a bit of citrus fruit flavor. The hops elevate this a bit while giving off a bit a tart aroma that could be shaping up to hit hard with bitter hop flavor.

The taste is piney at first with splash of pine, and some grassy hops that push the bitterness up a bit. Some hints of mango and tangerine reveal themselves as the bitterness wears down. Some malty biscuit flavor comes out before a slight twang at the end.

The feel of this beer is medium bodied and is really drinkable just as most Jacks Abbey beers are. Crisp and refreshing this beer goes down easy.","Cumberland, Rhode Island, USA","Duhast500"
2470,"2014-05-10",2.8,"Bottle... Hazy and peach-colored with a small, fleeting, white head. The nose is chock full of tannins and fruit rinds. Full-bodied with dancing carbonation. The flavor is bitter, bitter, bitter and bitter, flanked by more bitterness and minerals. Finishes tannicly bitter and dry. Not even close to being my thing.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2470,"2014-03-17",4.0,"Rcvd in trade. Reviewed from notes.
The appearance has a clear golden body with a three finger white foamy head that rises and falls and leaves some nice speckled/yet somewhat spider web lacing. There is some light slowly moving carbonation is seen rising.
The smell is spicy through the citrus, slight hint of pine, comes out slightly grassy as well.
The taste is spicy and bitter through previously mentioned flavors, slight grapefruit comes out slightly sweet (malty, perhaps?), sticky aftertaste.
The palate is about a medium, perhaps sessionable, yet smooth, dry finish.
Overall, this is a nice spicy Double Pilsner that is good for its style and good for me.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
2470,"2014-01-31",3.6,"Bottle @ Beachwood Brewing, sent courtesy of Clark. Slightly hazed orange pour with a white head. Smells of marmalade, candied orange peel, and caramel malt. Strong apricot jam notes as well. Much sweeter than I anticipated, particularly on the palate. Big time orange marmalade and apricot jam. Notes of pine and herbal bitterness on the finish. A fair amount of caramel sweetness, too. Lightly grassy.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2470,"2013-11-28",3.9,"In short: A crisp biscuity and very grapefruity Double IPA (I know, I know, its a lager). Very good.
How: Bottle 500ml, consumed moderately fresh weeks after receiving it from Loineshawn, formerly Lushawn, formerly the short ugly one in New Kids On The Block.
The look: Mostly cloudy dark blonde body topped by a medium white head with medium retention.
In long: The monster hoppy nose is mostly bright white grapefruits, a bit citric (lemon zest). In mouth the beer has a crisp & grainy texture with plenty of carbonation. Flavor wise the beer starts with crisp grainy crackery and biscuity malts offering a sugary sweetness (more residual sugars than actual honey or caramel). Assertive grapefruity hops offers a worthy opponent to the malts sweetness. Everything comes out very bright in this beer. Another excellent beer from Jack Abby. I really enjoyed this beer despite the rude bartender who refused to serve me another beer and said I already had too much to drink and I should take out the trash and I have to stop calling her bartender.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
2470,"2013-07-13",3.9,"hazy honey with a puffy white head. Dank ass nose, skunk hops with light biscuit underneath. Flavor equally dank, toast and darker grains with warmth. Abv in abc is most apparent in body, slick and lightly oppressive despite effervescence.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
2470,"2013-07-11",3.8,"Bottle thanks to Seth. Clear yellow pour with a white head. Grapefruit hop aromas. A little unbalanced. Grapefruit hop notes dominate. Decent mouthfeel and body.","Florida, USA","50belair"
2470,"2013-06-30",3.7,"glad i found this bottle at a new store i checked out. Was a little worried because i wasnt sure how old it was. But no need to fear. A good beer all around. Some peach and pine aromas with some dust and dankness. Bitter resin taste. light malt lager taste and little crisp body. Golden pretty color and as always a remarkable head. thumbs up jack.",", Massachusetts, USA","TheGent"
2470,"2013-06-19",4.2,"Tap and bottle.  Big beer, big taste.big hops.  Cant believe theyve sold out of this.  Pours golden with soft white head, an Imperial IPA in a lager, who knew?  These guys continue making new and different beer, hopefully this will be making a reapperance soon","Holliston, Massachusetts, USA","berniecarbo"
2470,"2013-05-30",4.2,"I love this brewery.  Amazing what theyre doing with lagers.  This is big and juicy like a 2XIPA.  Light orange in color with fluffy head.  Some pine and citrus in the nose and taste.  YUM!!!!","Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerathon"
2470,"2013-05-25",3.9,"Draft @ Lord Hobo. Snifter shows a  clear gold with thick retention down the glass. Nose is a delightful mixture of tropical fruit, grapefruit and biscuit malt. Flavor is ripe honeydew melon, grapefruit pith, over ripe pineapple and bitter grapefruit. Bitterness linger for a long duration, and hangs well after the final sip. Lots of fruit and solid bitterness. As this beer warms pine hops make an appearance. Damn, this is a really tasty brew, I would drink this any day of the week.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
2470,"2013-05-15",4.3,"MFG 03.28. Looks like they went from a generic printed month on some labels to an actual date stamp. 500 ml bottle into a tulip glass.

A - Pours a clear amber body. An absurd amount of foam forms after the pour, four fingers worth of bone white foam just over flowing out of the glass. Takes a while to calm down. Really excellent lacing with decent retention.

S - Pine and grapefruit. Faint malts. Oily and dank, but not as overpowering and intense as I was anticipating. 

T - Pine, resin, and some bitter grapefruit juice washed away by a clean and crisp finish. Its a really interesting beer in the fact that it starts off with a huge wave of flavor but it casually turns into something light and drinkable with a bit of a crackery malt. Long lasting bitterness with a lingering citric fruitiness. Damn you Jacks Abby and your crazy lager magic!

M - Medium bodied and crisp, this is dangerously drinkable. The 7.5% abv seems unbelievable.

O - I went into this beer expecting a hop bomb (100+ IBUs, 7.5%, multiple big name hop varieties) but that is not at all what this beer is about. In typical Jacks Abby fashion you get a whollop of flavor in a light and approachable vessel.The kind of beer that you could easily polish off a growler solo while destroying your palate. These guys continue to amaze me.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"
2470,"2013-05-15",4.0,"Really great hoppy lager with tons of floral and citrus notes that are beautifully matched with a smooth cracker type lager malt profile.  Huge drinkability for a 7.5 beer with tons of great flavor... LOVE IT>","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
2470,"2013-05-15",4.1,"16.9oz bottle, thanks to Mike L., shared with Caterwaul. MFG 3/28. Clear golden color. Thin off-white head, that retains. Great lace. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, lighter carbonation. More dry finish. Really big pine. Light citrus dry hop aroma. Light spicy hop. Hop flavor competes with the best IPAs. Barely tastes like a lager at all, if you werent looking for a lager taste, youd think this is an ale. Good bitter taste, light zesty. Super good, aggressively hoppy stuff. Huge flavor for the 7.5%. Flavor is bigger than youd expect from that level of alcohol. Fantastic stuff.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

2470,"2013-04-22",4.2,"Overall very good, great beer overall, lots of tropical fruits and grapefruit, citrus, floral slightly spicy hops, hop profile is great. Brings quite a bit of btterness but never overpowers thanks to a hint of toasty pilsner malt that brings just enough to the table to keep the hops from getting out of hand without pushing into the forefront at all. It also maintains a little crisp lager profile in there too. Very nice!","South Euclid, Ohio, USA","DoublEE"
2470,"2013-04-21",3.8,"Pretty sure I still smell like strippers. Fucken a tried to bring this shit with me to the breast bar last night but you cant bring bottles of beer into the strip club, just cans. Kind of glad Im drinking this now instead of then. Gold, slight haze, some head on this beast but nothing out of the ordinary. Fruit forward hops, a bit of oily pine tar, toasted mackeral. Finish is dry, bitter hinting towards to bitter for me, but I know some bros love that shit. Fucken A edmond thanks for all of these belgium abby ales.","@ $13.99, Iowa, USA","DietPepsican"
2470,"2013-04-15",4.2,"Bottle provided by Allen, thanks a bunch! Pours a fingers worth of soapy, white head with a dark yellow/light orange in color. Nose is very fruity and floral. It is comprised of orange and pineapple, with some earthy hops. There is also some biscuit malt in the background. Stone fruit is at a minimum here, this is more about assertive hoppiness. It punches you in the mouth with pine and doesnt relent. Mouthfeel is light to moderate, bitterness is strong, booziness is well hidden, and has a long finish. Another great hoppy lager from Jacks Abby, they are on top of the lager game right now.","Illinois, USA","Dunt"
2470,"2013-04-15",4.2,"Ahhhh..... lager. Big shout out to Edmund Edmonds for hooking a brother Up with this garbage!!!  Pours a slightly hazy orange with a white head. Aromas of pine and citrus.

2470,"2013-04-13",3.9,"Bottle.   Aroma of big juicy grapefruit.  Citrus.  Juicy oranges.  Pleasant juicy grapefruit and oranges backed by a somewhat muddled toasted dough.   Tasty.   Tad big for my liking.  Nice hop profile. A cleaner 6ish abv beer would be nice.  Pretty solid.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
2470,"2013-04-12",3.7,"Tap.  Pours a clear gold with a pillowy head that sticks around.  The flavor is mildly hoppy but has a strong, piney bitterness that overpowers any other flavors in the beer.  OK overall.","Massachusetts, USA","sailracer"
2470,"2013-04-09",4.0,"Pours a light golden color with great clarity and a finger of sticky white fizz. On the nose there is some nice tropical hop notes that mingle with a touch of earthy spice and a biscuity malt background. On the palate its solid with big fruity notes on the front end... peach, mango, citrus zest.. flowing into a piney bitter mid to late palate that lingers nicely and rolls back into a subtle stone fruit finish. The fruit shines even more as the beer slowly warms in the glass. Great blend of hops and a wonderfully balanced mouthfeel.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
2470,"2013-04-08",3.7,"500ml bottle in a tulip.  Pours clear golden with a white head. Aroma of piney and citrusy hops with some light malts.  Flavor the same, with a nice amount of hops.  Average texture.  A good lager.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
2470,"2013-04-08",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2014 500mL bottle purchased from Learys for $4.30. Just couldnt pass up another untried hoppy lager from Jacks. Glad I made the commitment to buy. To brandy snifter, it pours a deep darkish copper-orangeade with a fluffy, sudsy snowed-white head, about two fingers measured. Smells wonderful: its of American hops (citrus, pine, earth), sourdough bread, ciabatta, grapefruit zest, pineapples, white sage, rosin, melons, and Bible paper. Tastes as it smells, but not as complex as I would have hoped and expected: by mid-palate its hinting at limes, caramelized onions, and chrysanthemum flowers. Quite bitter; by swallow its as if I were chewing on hop pellets, good hops, mind you, but hops nonetheless. Not in love, but Id buy this again. Recommendable.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"
2470,"2013-04-08",4.2,"Pours deep gold into a Sam glass. White head with good retention recedes leaving spider lacing. Tangerine and resin aromas. Soft with sweet tropical fruit and resin upfront turning hot in the earthy grapefruit pith finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"

2470,"2013-04-05",4.2,"Bottle from Learys, bottle dated March 28th
Pours a glowing gold with a craggy white head.  Aroma is biscuit, peach, orange juice, lemon zest, and a flutter of overripe mango.  Full and zesty mouthfeel, with a bit of stickiness that dries out towards the finish.  Flavor is bursting with bright orange and lemon zest, light earthy pine, dank mango, and finishes as if nibbling on orange peels - drying, bitter, and zesty.  This drinks as if it is sub 5%.  Tasty is an understatement.","Chester, Vermont, USA","Jblauvs"
