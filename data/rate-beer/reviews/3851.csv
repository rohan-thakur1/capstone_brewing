3851,"2015-04-23",4.3,"Pour on tap at the brewery, hazy golden-orange pour with fluffy lacing white head, aroma brought big notes of pine, resin, lots of tropical fruit, hints of orange, grapefruit, citrus, lemon into some bready, toasted cracker notes. Taste was a nice mango, pineapple, slight passion fruit into grapefruit, some pine, resinous, almost an oniony note into a bit of cracker, bread, some lemony, zesty notes, finishing bitter, dry. Delicious.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
3851,"2014-10-26",4.8,"Simply put, one of the finest American IPAS ever made. Gushing with juicy tropical fruit, weirdly almost creamy in texture, like a fruit smoothie in beer form. Truly incredible beer.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
3851,"2014-08-18",4.1,"Growler, filled 8/12 and consumed, regrettably, 8/18. Has held up well though. Pours cloudy cantaloupe color, small head. Aroma is juicy pineapple, dank piney hops, mango, melon, light booze, cotton candy, really great. Taste is juicy mango fading into some malt sweetness and pine, but just so drinkable. One of the better TH beers Ive had. Excellent.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","dfroms"
3851,"2014-08-15",4.4,"Growler from brewpub. Pours golden with thin frothy head. Aromas of mango, melon, grass, citrus, cucumber. Tastes are the same plus scallion and spicy pepper. Finishes long and dry. Amazing beer. One of the best IPAs I have ever tasted.","Pennsylvania, USA","digrod"

3851,"2014-08-13",3.9,"Growler, 8/9 on 8/13. Hazy golden pour with white head. Nice funky, tropical, and grassy aromas and flavors. Nice pretty fresh.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
3851,"2014-08-11",4.5,"Growler from TH. Pours a murky honey yellow gold with a medium sized frosty white head. Aroma of tropical fruit(kiwi, passion fruit, mango, papaya) melon, orange peel, grapefruit and hops. Taste of tropical fruit, melon, orange peel, grapefruit and fresh hops. This was a treat.","Doylestown, PA, USA","adrian910ss"
3851,"2014-08-10",4.4,"Fresh growler I bought earlier today. Nose is explosively fruity and especially juicy, orange peel and rind, grapefruit, heavy and tangy tangerine, heavy kiwi, heavy passionfruit (think NOS intensity and youre there) - truly superlative! Pours hazy orange-golden with a short, clingy beige head.Medium-full body, carbonated but very smooth, as if with a touch of wheat, moderately dry, zesty, with medium bitterness for an IPA and tons of the aforementioned juice. Bitterness an dryness seem to increase over time, and theres a pleasant yeasty-bready component to the aftertaste. Ultra refreshing! Love this hop and love how its used here.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
3851,"2014-08-10",4.4,"Pours a super hazy golden orange with a creamy white lacing head. Aroma of a handful of fresh American hops. Loads of orange zest, lemon juice, spring flowers and a pine forest. Flavor of hoppy dankness, all those same great American hops and a slight touch of malt :). Super crips and dry. Awesome IPA!","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
3851,"2014-02-02",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2014 Growler: Thanks, Hayden! Cloudy, sunburst body with a foamy, eggshell head that fades in just a few moments to a thin collar around the edge. Aroma is an insane mixture of tropical fruit.... Papaya, mango, lots of passion fruit, pineapple, with slight undertones of grass, dank weed, & plenty of hop oils. Just a dripping wet, tropical hop bomb. Taste starts with a nice, wet grassy bitter bite before launching back into tropical fruit land... More mango, pineapple, & passion fruit, backed by only the smallest helping of cracker-y malt sugars. Plenty of dank hop oils all around as well, finishing wish a leftover tropical fruit & hoppy grass character. Slight creaminess to the body, but still zesty & sharp, leaving a light coating on the palate in the aftertaste. Awesome IPA, another hoppy winner from Tired Hands. I love these guys.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

Bottle: The aroma consists of tropical fruits, dank hops, citrus, lemon peel, and grapefruit. It pours a hazy dull orange with a small white head outlined by a slightly thicker soapy ring. The flavor starts with tropical fruits and faint melon. The finish has citrus, grapefruit, and dank hops. Its light-medium bodied with soft carbonation. Overall a very tasty and super drinkable IPA.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3851,"2014-01-29",4.0,"Pours a hazy milky yellow with a thick white head. Aroma of tropical fruit, citrus, grapefruit and freshly milled grain. Taste is bitter citrus, passion fruit and papaya. Light and drinkable with ridiculous flavor.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","jcartamdg"
3851,"2014-01-26",4.2,"Draft @ the brewpub, 1/24/2012. Great nose of tropical fruit, light traces of pine. The flavor is nothing short of amazing. Flavor is big notes of tropical fruits, sticky resin and sweet grain and even a touch of grapefruit and lemon rind. What is completely amazing to me is the amount of hops flavor without any bitterness. No bitterness? Off the chain good for a standard IPA Effervescent mouthfeel with the amount of flavor makes me want to chug it. This should be brewed more often as a flagship brew. Masterfully crafted.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3851,"2014-01-20",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2014 glowing gold with puffy white head that drops fast. Muted honey and hay nose, faint orange notes with spicy rye. Pillowy-soft palate cradles orange and candy up front, oily mid palate shows vegetal hints before biscuit and sugars dominate the finish. Palate and balance are the highlights, bit stinging and sweet at the end and the spicy nose is conflicted.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
3851,"2014-01-18",4.0,"Draft at the brewpub. Pours hazy yellow with a medium sized white head. The aroma has grapefruit, tangerine, orange, mango. The taste is sweet juicy fruits with a bit of a grapefruit finish. Tons of citrus and very well balanced. Awesome.","Spring City, Pennsylvania, USA","boxofrane"
3851,"2014-01-07",3.2,"Updating based on tasting notes; had beer fresh from the tap as well as in a same-day growler. The aroma on this beer was huge. All floral and citrusy. Nice, pale appearance. Taste followed the aroma, but was very fleeting. As soon as I swallowed, the taste was gone. Non-existent mouthfeel; very watery. Overall, this prompted me to thing of what a hop tea might taste like--very aromatic, flowery water. Would love to try this beer with more (any?) body.","","Coopertown"
3851,"2014-01-01",4.3,"From notes, Draft at THBC. Pours cloudy orange to gold with some head that leaves lacing. nose is mild pine, scallion,tropical fruits and citrus peal. first sip is similar with toasted notes and mild mellon. finish is clean with citrus and juicy fruits. very nice.","Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, USA","Macegan75"
3851,"2013-12-30",3.9,"Hazy golden orange color with a small, white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of tropical fruits, citrus, floral hops, light pine and toast. Taste of citrus, tropical fruits, toast, orange, light onion, and grapefruit in the finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
3851,"2013-12-29",4.1,"Day old growler from the source. Cloudy brown orange with a frosting. Nose is tangerine, ripe cheese, dank weed and pine. Pungent funk; wow! Medium to full body with a tang. Softly bitter, juicy, rindy and mouth numbing. Taste is tangerine pith, grapefruit juice, chewed grass, bay leaf and citrus honey. So big for a regular IPA.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
3851,"2013-12-29",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2013 On tap at Tired Hands. Poured cloudy pale yellow orange with decent white head lace. Pleasant aroma of citrus with some pine. Light bitter taste.","New York, New York, USA","charule"
3851,"2013-12-29",3.9,"Tasted from Growler filled the day before. Poured a hazy yellow color with a white head. Very nice hoppy aroma - citrus, floral, and some tropical fruitiness. Tastes, although a bit muted, of the same. The aromas left me wanting more out of the tastes. A tad bit salty too.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
3851,"2013-12-28",4.2,"Hazy golden-orange body, medium sized white head, soapy lacing. Waves of citric hops: tangerines, oranges, clementines, grapefruit. Some mango, resin, and pine. Complex flavor with nice balance and nuance. Medium bodied, appropriately carbonated, assertive bitterness. Nice use of mosaic.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
3851,"2013-12-27",4.6,"Growler. Holy shitballs, this is incredible. Straw-colored pour retains plenty of white head and beady lace, but who cares? I can smell the hoppy dankness from across the room. Layers upon layers of fresh Mosaic hops slap me across the face. Fuck me, this is amazing. 

Flavor opens up on my palate, bringing an expansive bouquet of fresh, citrusy, Mosaic hops. So damn good; so fresh and dank. Infects my dome piece like pedio in a CIB brew near a school zone. Damn son, that is dank. 

And I haven't even mentioned the crowning achievement of this brew yet: the mouthfeel is nothing short of revolutionary. It's creamy and viscous on the level of the Toppling Goliath stouts (wtf?!!), which is entirely unheard of in the world of IPAs. A game changer -- if we are lucky. 

Truly couldn't be much more impressed by a Single IPA, especially since I dislike nearly every beer in this style. Wow.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"
3851,"2013-12-27",4.3,"another killer hoppy offering from Tired Hands Pooping Company! Will they ever stop?!","Washington, USA","lachrymalisis"
3851,"2013-12-27",4.8,"UPDATED: AUG 10, 2014 On tap at the source, pours murky orange golden with thick and lasting head. Beautiful lacing patterns left on inner glass. Aromas are clementines, mango, cream, pine, tangerine, orange grove. Flavor is dank fucking hops, tropical mosaic notes along with some pine, tart blueberry, grapefruit. Theres gotta be some simcoe or citra in here as well. Finishes on the dryer and tangy side of the spectrum. Medium bodied. Incredible IPA from Tired Hands. Cask version with Motueka. Notes are mango, pineapple, hop rez, oranges, skunk, and lemon skin. Love the addition of NZ skunkiness. Tried again in August 14...Jesus Christ, might be the best IPA tired has ever out in my opinion, peach, minerals, rock salt, red grapefruit, and orange flavor jizz stains.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
3851,"2013-12-24",4.2,"Growler a few hours old from the brewery. Aroma of huge tangerine and some grapefruit. Very Citra like aroma, however mosaic hops. Some dankness shines through a tad. One of the better smelling juicy IPAs. Taste is slightly bitter but very refreshing. Extremely light on the palate. Effervescent carb and light body typical of TH.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Art"
3851,"2013-12-23",4.6,"pours a hazy pale yellow/orange with a creamy medium white head...great lacing and retention. aroma has light herbal qualities with underlying mango, citrus rind, and faint pine...awesome! flavor follows suit...nice herbal and rindy notes but mango is not forgotten...move over HT.
