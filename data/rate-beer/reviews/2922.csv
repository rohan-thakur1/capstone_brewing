2922,"2016-07-29",4.1,"Bottle @ Home. Bright golden colored cider with a short lived, fizzy white head and fairly lively bubbles. Huge apple character here. Really fresh, juicy, semi-sweet apple.

2922,"2016-05-06",3.9,"Bottle from I-dont-remember-where. Listed as 4% on the label.

Vivid gold pour, sparkling. Warm apple aromas, just a bit of vinegar intensity. The flavors are sweeter and less complex than the other Eric Bordelet cider and less intense than the perry, but its a lovely mouthful of the best sparkling cider one has ever tasted, mostly sweet apple up front with just a bit of tannic intensity very late. Very delicious but certainly on the sweet side for what I usually like to drink; think Alpenfire.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

The nose has notes of baked apple, apple skin, honey and apple blossoms. The flavor is moderately sweet with baked apple notes from the nose, honey and skins. The finish is heavier in apple skin. On the palate it is light-medium in body with a smooth, watery texture and soft carbonation. Overall, a truly excellent cider.
