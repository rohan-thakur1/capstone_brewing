735,"2014-03-03",3.5,"Best by April 29, 2014.
Appearance: The body seems opaque but under a bright light some garnet hues appear around all but the center. The body appears murky, but a nice color. The head is short and khaki, poor retention. It settles to a thin, but full, coating with a creamy ring.
Aroma: The aroma leans a little sweet with bittersweet chocolate and a slightly herbal quality. Licorice shows through, but doesnt dominate. The aroma is pleasant with good strength.
Taste: The flavor is a nice blend of chocolate and hints of bitterness with a slight licorice and roasted finish. No real rye is showing, perhaps a touch on the base, but this is mostly chocolate and licorice.
Palate: Soft bodied, a bit flat tasting.
Overall: This is a decent rye stout, but the licorice throws it off a bit for me. I also feel like this is a bit muddy in flavor, no real stand out flavors. This drinks nicely though, I just wouldnt buy it again.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Ahh, the beer series I almost nearly always forget as the bottle label never changes (admittedly, their new labels are quite eye-catching).

Appearance: Pours a black body with a lean, light khaki-colored head that doesnt stick around too terribly long.

Smell: Roasty, sure, but, theres also a strong Munich toasty note present. Nice chocolate scented accent. Incorporated dark fruitiness, maybe a sliver of licorice. Minor rye. A very thin trace of smokiness. And all of the creamy, milk notes youd expect from a milk stout, cept this isnt!

Taste: Roast, deep toasted barley, and a coating of chocolate and whipping cream. Fair sweetness, some additional caramelized sugars. Modest rye character. A singular drop of smoky molasses. A light touch of dark fruits. Huh. You know, for a beer that isnt supposed have an infusion of lactose, for me, it definitely has a great milky/creamy quality to it. Faint, faint herb, citrus imparted by the hops. Sweetish, roasty, and still so smooth and milky on the finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Overall: I was actually expecting something a bit more along the lines of their previous Volume 4. Thankfully, that wasnt the case. V5 is the best non-milk non-stout Ive had in quite some time!","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Definitely picking up nut bread, more of a cocoa taste that molasses, licorice, rye, black pepper, a bit of coffee, and a nice earthy hop finish. Medium body, slick texture, lively carbonation, long somewhat bitter finish of roasty malts and hops. Just an all around great brew.

735,"2013-11-06",3.4,"These fade to black beers are about the only products I still buy from Left Hand, and truthfully, I look forward to the new release each year - as Ive come to expect, this is a solid beer, but probably my least favorite in the series so far (but only by a tiny bit) - pours looking like cola - nose is a hearty mixture of roasted malts and toasty, spicy rye, with some earthy notes and moderate chocolate sweetness - body is medium - moderate carbonation, leading the a kind of slick mouthfeel on the back end - fairly sweet, but with moderate acidity, light char, roast, and spicy rye, all of which offset that sweetness for the most part - finish is slightly warming and moderately spicy, with some licorice flavor - some lingering sweetness on the tongue is a little unwelcome - pretty good brew.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
735,"2013-11-04",3.7,"Whole Foods, Bowery 355ml ($2): Pours black with a smallish tan head. Aroma is roasted malt, molasses, licorice, a bit of hops, and some light rye. Taste is subdued roasted rye. Some hoppiness. Plenty of earthiness. Relatively little amounts of sweetness. Interesting combination of flavors that evades most standard classifications.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
735,"2013-11-01",3.6,"Bottle. Opaque black pour with a short, dense brown head. Aroma is kind of smoky with strong roasted malt notes, dark chocolate, hints of coffee and caramel. Taste is roasted malt, smoked wood, dark chocolate, light licorice, caramel notes and coffee. Not much rye to this. Body is medium but soft with a dense, creamy carbonation and moderate stickiness. Ends with more roasted malt, smoked malt, dark chocolate, candy notes, coffee, light licorice and caramel notes.","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
735,"2013-10-31",3.8,"Draft. Pours a medium, poorly retained, beige head, with minimal lacing, over a clear dark brown (SRM 35) body.....nose is early coffee, later chocolate, cocoa, with rye, minimal hops, no esters.....taste is rye spice, chocolate, cocoa, dry throughout, finish is moderate bitterness, rye, and roasted malts linger, with the mild bitterness.....mouth feel medium, alcohol hidden, carbonation gives a creamy texture, with mild acid tingle. This is a delicious, well balanced beer with good complexity in both aroma and flavor. BJCP 9/3/16/5/7","Salida, Colorado, USA","drjay44"
735,"2013-10-29",3.5,"12oz bottle. Mostly clear dark brown / reddish color. Nice thin khaki head when pouring, fades to a minimal ring though, and doesnt leave much lace. Crisp carbonation of moderate strength, but a good, chewy, bigger body. Nice complex dark aroma - coffee, spicy rye, little maple and a reasonable (small) amount of licorice, as well as a solid amount of earthy hop bitterness. Light spicy sweetness. Aside from the bigger body, alcohol is hidden well. Solid black rye ale. A unique combo of flavors, and they work well. Kudos to Left Hand for coming up with a distinctly different black ale every year, I like this series.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
735,"2013-10-29",3.7,"Bottle. Poured a dark brown color with a moderate frothy tan head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted sweet malt, coffee and wood aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy complex dark sweet flavor with a medium dark sweet tingly finish of moderate duration. Solid drinkable brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
735,"2013-10-22",3.8,"Truly a Great craft Rye Ale to bring in the Fall season. I loved the pour on this, a nice tan head with some smooth sweetness coming off the nose and that of coffee and maybe even some roasted nuts and molasses. Taste was spot on and I thoroughly enjoyed this beer!","Colorado, USA","BigBodyBenz"
735,"2013-10-18",3.7,"Sampled at the brewery. The aroma is roasted malts, slight smoke, rye maltiness. The flavor its roasted malts, chocolate, malty, slight acidity from the roasted malts. Hints of spice, probably from the rye malts.","Bountiful, Utah, USA","Gription79"
