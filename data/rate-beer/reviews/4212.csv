4212,"2016-06-22",3.8,"Growler shared 6/10/16. Definitely a very unexpected surprise, as I never ended up trying this stuff back in the day (that I remember). Good clarity to this black cherry liquid with some brighter hues on the edges. Pink-flecked, off-white head is initially large but fully falls to cover/ring rather quickly.Huge cherry nose has light glue, medicines, all sorts of phenols and definitely some wood/vegetal-like cherryskin notes. Despite the slight medicinal/phenolic character, which I believe is actually quite natural/authentic, its bursting with huge aromatics and bright fruit flavors but yet retains a funky, fermented/macerated feel to it as well. Honey and vanilla show through, from the malts, packing the aroma even more full. No alcohol or flaw.Just like the 2 Roads Framboise Noir was ultra jammy, this thing is super medicinal, but in a mostly good way. Lots of cherry pit, cherry flesh and light cellar qualities, with huge black pepper phenols and a sweet, lightly syrupy at times (but for the engaging carbonation which helps clear it) texture. Definitely on the sweeter side of things, relative to Belgian fruit beers, much like New Glarus. But just like them, the fruit is done so well that its easy to forgive a lot.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

A bit of leg to this one as well. Aromas are just loaded with cherries, as many of the reviews have said. It still cant be stressed enough how loaded this beer is with cherries! Other aromas may include a musty ester, light brown sugar and more cherries! The taste has an upfront tartness flash...but that quickly fades into a rich, full-bodied cherry pie filling. There is not much tartness to speak of after that....maybe hints of funk towards the back end...and as it warms. Its more of a ""tang"" in my book. ""Traditional"" is another word that comes to mind when thinking of the flavor....but how do you describe what ""traditional"" tastes like?! I dont know either, but this beer has that element. Even after 2 full pours, the sweetness never became overbearing. Slightly sticky in mouthfeel and semi-dry in character. The finish was more of a fade as the cherry pie lingered. Paired well with cheese curds and chocolates. Definitely worth seeking out.","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"

A: Ruby hued with a gigantic tan head that coats the glass in lacing.

S: The aroma is more subtle than the taste. Scents include cherries, cherries, cherries with hints of cherry pie and cherries. Oh, yeah I almost forgot...cherries. Its really that simple.

T: Cherries, fresh from the tree. The beer is sweet but not cloying. This is without a doubt my favorite fruit beer that isnt sour. Its very drinkable and enjoyable. Other beers of this ilk often quickly become cloying and lose their appeal. Not the case with this well-crafted gem.

M: Smooth and tasty. Great carbonation level, especially from a growler.

D: Surprisingly easy to drink, as the beer has considerable sweetness. One would think the beer would become cloying, but its just so tasty I keep going back for more.

4212,"2011-09-09",4.2,"Big thanks to chase2634 for this. Poured into a snifter.

3.5 A: Lightly hazed deep amber mahogany color. Just a small touch of carbonation. Seems like the growler didnt keep its seal.

4.5 S: A deep mixture of cherry. Sweet, prime of the ripe black cherry. Tart, hard red cherry. A touch of booze, but not hot. More like a the way a cheap, overly sweet brandy is boozy. This is a lot like NG BR, but the fruit isnt as in-your-face powerful and thus allows the base beer to also be discernable. The malts give a neutral sweetness and are grainy overall. Quite nice.

4.5 T: Taste is naturally dominated by cherry. The sweet fruitiness outweighs the tart by a good margin. I would liken it to a cherry pie made from cans. Intense cherry throughout, which covalesce to produce a light medicinal vibe. A slight tart bite on finish. Again, grainy malts. Light nutmeg spiciness. Very good.

4.5 M: Heavier medium body. Surprisingly, the carbonation is adequate. Rich and slightly chewy, the way this beer should be.

4.5 D: To make a good fruit beer, the brewer needs to really commit to the fruit. This does just that. Perfect beer for the cherry lover who wants a break from Belgian Red.

4212,"2011-08-21",4.3,"On tap at the brewery. This was the beer I was most excited about trying during my trip to PA. We drove two hours out of our way and it was well worth the trip (as was the brewpub experience). It pours very similar to the picture in the profile. I imagine this beer has remained consistent over the years. Beautiful deep red color with a small off white head. The aroma is decadent with cherry flesh and juice. Somewhat pie like, yet without any semblance of sugariness. The flavor is as good as it gets for a cherry beer. Fresh black cherry juice covers over any malt flavors. Hops are nonexistent. The only other thing I can pick up is a slight hint of spicy yeast esters, but only if you really concentrate. The body is very full and slightly syrupy as it warms. Carbonation is spot on. The finish is mildly puckering but not in a tart or sour way, more of a fruity way. I really loved this beer. Sheer cherry heaven.

A - Pours ruby red with a thick, creamy, one finger tall pink head leaving spotty lacing down the glass.

S - The aroma is very sweet. Smells of tart cherries, candied sugar, light spice, and some pie crust dryness toward the end. A bit dull at first but once it warmed up there is no doubt what is in this one.

T - Starts off with a nice dose of candied sweetness quickly being enveloped by the tart cherries that permeate every inch of this beer. Some vanilla, light spice, and graham cracker crust lend a bit of contrast but this one really is all about the cherries. Finish is a mix of dryness and candied sugar sweetness, lingering for some time.

M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Sweet, dry, feel with plenty of lingering sweetness in the finish.

O - This truly is one of the best desert beers out there. It has so much rich flavor but it never gets to the point of being overwhelming. Easily one of the best fruit beers.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

Aroma is a little weak. The provider of the growler warned us that this one was weaker than the other one he had opened a month ago even though they were kept cold. I can detect some cherries in there though. Even diminished the aroma is good.

Beer has a medium to low body. Overall light tasting. Good cherry flavor, nice sourness overall to the beer. Some good citric qualities throughout. Drinkability is high (I could have taken down this entire growler myself) and mouthfeel is great. The carbonation helps to carry the sour notes throughout the palate.

Spicy hints of cinnamon and bread spices. Undertones of bitter almonds, caramel, earth, plastic and raisins. The flavour is light to medium sweet at first but the finish is fairly acidic.

Cherries definitely dominate here, but they are nicely balanced with sweetness and tartness working well together. A little bit medicinal, but a very nice beer.

4212,"2009-08-05",3.9,"Growler. Thanks SuzyGreenberg! Pours murky, ruddy dark amber. Loose bubbles around the lip. Some grainy particulates, and a little bit of clingy carb stuck at the bottom. Big ripe sour cherry nose; not shockingly sharp by any means, but noteworthily cherryesque and very much from a sour cherry base--not sweet snacking cherries. Sticky medium body, nearly still if not totally still. Huge ripping tart cherry flavor on the mid-palate. Definitely not overly sweet; on the sweetness scale it falls somewhere between fruit juice and a dry APA. Long sticky fruit sugar finish. Everything about this beer is permeated with cherry flavor, its a beautifully executed extraction of that fruit essence. Good stuff.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

Hints of herbal leafiness helps to balance the sweetness of the cherries nicely.  Medium bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel with a touch of acidity.  Sweet, but not sticky, and brimming with one of the most authentic cherry flavors Ive tasted in a beer.  Gobs of fruit, with some cherry-skin tannins coming through on the backend to round out the finish.

The sourness is subtle making this like cherry sweet tart, but without any artificial flavors added.

4212,"2008-06-05",4.0,"Objectively speaking:
A sharp fruit beer that offers a very serious compromise between refreshment and intensity.

I like:
This was from Stines handbottles via Glouglou and it seems to have held up very well. The carbonation is still very appropriate. Considerable tart bite towards the finish. Well extracted cherry flavours. 8% alcohol never hampers the refreshment. 

I dislike:
Not much to dislike about this was besides its rarity. It was much drier than I expected and relatively complex in its maltiness with earthy, toffee and a robust palate to boot.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
4212,"2008-06-04",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 7, 2010 In short: A kick-ass cherry beer.  That simple.
How: Tap at brewpub and also Hand-bottles from Stine some time ago
The look: Beautiful glowing dark red body with a medium beige head.
In long: Nose of some kind of stale cherry drink with a slight decaying sensation.  Not an unpleasant aroma at all but the nose definitely was its weakest feature.  Everything else kicked-ass in this beer and that little nose imperfection is probably not present fresh from the tap.  As with most good fruit beers the taste is rather focussed, and this one proposes earthy cherries and also some wild cherries flavours.  Medium tartness and medium sourness.  Very tasty.  Not a refreshing fruit beer this one is actually quite nourishing and tasty.  Compared to the Belgian Red (drank 5 minutes before) the Phoenix Kriek was more pure cherry skin oriented while the Belgian Red was more on the sweet maraschino side of things.  They are a lot more different than I expected.   But after drinking the Belgian Red followed by this Phoenix Kriek I can honestly say that Ive never enjoyed tasting cherries that much, and thats including my teenage years and the things we did when our parents were away.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

4212,"2008-05-26",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Earth-covered cherries and raisins sensuously ride caramel maltiness until balsamic tartness sweeps the palate and allows more fruitiness for a solo performance. This is a sumptuous Fruit Beer which must be simply wondrous on tap at the brewpub.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy sheet of foam decorates the murky red.
-There is a slight problem with the nose in this bottle (its too earthy and vegetal), but I suspect this will not be the case on tap at the brewery.
-This is better balanced than the New Glarus fruit beers and probably of the same quality when its in its finest form.
-The finish is not sour, but just tart enough to make you lick your gums and dive in for a even bigger sip.
-The mouthfeel is luxuriously round, yet very drinkable. A perfect middle ground.

4212,"2008-04-12",4.4,"Growler.  Pours deep crimson red; mahogany to one level of light and firey violet to another.  Aroma of fresh cherries and lots of vanilla sugar; more sweet than tart, with hints of strawberry, brown sugar glazed orange, cinnamon whipped cream and sweetened tea. Vibrant.  Subtle.  Flavor is so generous and forthright; not a lighthearted, sweet, feathery take on cherry but more a venture into its possibilities and toward its boundaries.  Cinnamon and nutmeg are the immediate suggestions, riding a swell of mulled, firm, hearty tart cherry flavor and doughy, salty pastry crust.  So much muscle and wine-like depth.  Some green qualities of stems and spices lend a bittering earthiness on the outer rim.  Palate is gently carbonated, medium to full in body; punchy tartness and sangria-like tanginess to the extent of pomegranate arils wetting and then quickly drying the sides of the mouth.  Dry cinnamon, a wisp of tarragon and fruit flesh in the warming, mulling final smack.  What a gorgeously stylish take on this concept.  Thanks Chris!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
4212,"2008-04-10",3.8,"Growler, courtesy TheCheeseMan.  Pours a clear, purplish, crimson red color.  A small, foamy, cream colored head settles to a wispy film, leaving minimal, sudsy lacing behind.  The nose can only be described as a freshly baked cherry pie.  Even the sugar glazed, baked crust comes through, along with the sweet-tart, cooked cherries.  The flavor is essentially the same, but perhaps a bit sweeter than the nose shows.  Ultra-sweet cherries meet tart cranberry sauce and savory, lightly salted pie crust.  Theres none of the typical annoying, artificial fruit extract elements here.  This one is pure, fresh fruit and pastry.  The body is medium-full, syrupy, and just shy of cloying.  Incredible that this brew is 8%, as it seems more like 5%.  Short of New Glarus, this is about as good as it gets for fruit beer.  Thanks CheeseMan!","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Aroma of funky sour cherries, spicy cherry pits, graham crackers and cherry soda. Flavor starts with a combo of sweet and sour cherries, the graham cracker provides the crust for this cherry pie. Palate is med full up front with the sweet, but then it lightens on the way back as the tartness tightens pulls and puckers at the sides of the tongue. The tartness begins to border on a cranberry sauce acidity. Finish is bone dry and refreshing. Just outstanding.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

4212,"2007-06-17",3.4,"Crimson orange in color. Off-white head with pinkish hues settles into a tight, sticky fringe. Ripe black- and sour-pie cherry aromas with hints of raisins, straw, cinnamon and caramelized (Munich?) malt. Soft prickles of fuzzy carbonation. Tartness initially teases the palate but is largely neutralized by the fairly weighty residuals which outweigh much of the potential brightness. Explosively ripe surge of luscious cherries establishes itself alongside a peach-fuzz bitterness. Very little depth, however. Vague rubbery astringency develops late in the swallow. Phenols are entirely nonexistent, as is the malt which scarcely lends a slightly crunchy quality which resembles straw and crackers. Finishes with notes of black cherries and raisins, but overly brief as well as wet, unpleasantly rubbery and astringent. Those who rave about New Glarus Belgian Red will undoubtedly enjoy the authentic/fresh, albeit one-dimensional, cherry profile of this. Not really my bag, though, as it is rather flabby and lacking in dryness, depth, yeast character and assertive sourness. Malt also lacks definition. Should they inoculate some barrels with wild yeast, they will likely have great success as they are definitely on the right track.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

4212,"2007-06-13",3.6,"Growler sampled approximately 1 week after being filled, May 2007
Pours with an opaque, quite hazy, dark purple, yet still cherry red color.  The pour from the growler easily summons forth a three-finger thick, pinkish, light tan colored head.  The aroma is quite cherry driven; chewy-cherry skin notes lend a fullness to the dominant sweet cherry candy-like nose.  The aroma really reminds me of the cherry character in a well made batch of cherry ice-cream.  My guess is that these are not sour cherries, but they still smell fairly enticing in this beer.

The beer is lightly sweet up front, but thankfully not sticky or syrup-like in texture or sweetness.  There is a nice level of tartness here, though not to the level of a Lambic.  The chewy cherry skin character from the aroma is in the flavor, though not quite as prominent as in the nose.  There seems to be a hint of plastic phenolics character that is lying just underneath the surface here; it is just barely noticeable though.  This beer is very cherry focused, somewhat similar (perhaps even inspired by) to New Glarus Belgian Red, though I dont think it is quite as sweet, nor as tannic & chewy as that beer.  The beer is fairly well carbonated, which adds a touch of zesty prickly character.  This helps to lighten the thick chewy character a bit.  I do like that this beer is fairly thick & rich; it makes it sort of like a dessert, but not necessarily a sweet one.

This is quite a nice beer, I would love to see this fermented more towards the Lambic side of the spectrum, but that would ruin the hearty desert quality of this beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Sweet cherries, bright red fruit, and candied sugars burst onto my tongue.  Immediately the cherries turn tart and slightly lactic leaving me with dark dried fruits and  earthy/nutty/woody notes.

A pleasure just to look at.  Nose is very similar to the belgian red with a little more tartness. Flavor is sweet at first with cherry pie filling and a very nice lactic, slightly sour finish that leaves you begging for more. Full on fresh sour black cherries come through more as it warms.  After my first couple glasses I thought it needed to be more sour, but as I wind down to final few pours I think this beer is just right. Alcohol is completely hidden. Shit, this is delicious.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

4212,"2007-05-11",3.5,"(growler, thanks mj) Small beige head with murky copper body.  Aroma is moderately sweet, strawberry, some cherry, raspberry.  Taste is medium sweet, cherry through-and-through -- that is to say, it tastes like the entire cherry, including the pit, has been liquefied, revealing the tartness, sourness, and arsenic bitterness contained therein.  Medium body, some acidity, light chewiness.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"

Medium plus mouhfeel, and a bit of above average carbonation which doesnt detract. Would like another glass in a month.

4212,"2007-05-04",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2011 March 2008 batch

Very dry, tart and puckery, the fruity is still quite pitty and stemy, theres a ton of cherry skin tannins which give it a moderate to heavy astringency, not seen so much in last years batch, and the fruit is much less sweet, much more dry, more coarse, more pitty and woody, even a little ashy.  


March 2007 batch
Incredible dark purple and dark pink murky appearance, speckled tan, almost red hued, thin filmy head, sustaining a film throughout the drink.  I want to call the texture syrupy but that brings to mind the wrong ideas.  Perhaps full and thick without being heavy is the best way to describe it... the sourness is mild but easily noticed, and well-appreciated, but theres also this amazing oak dryness at times, mingling with the semi-tart black cherry pitty flavor.  This beer mixes the natural sweetness of the fruit (which really isnt sweet as in sugary, but sweet as in ripe) with a light sourness as well, lightly lactic and creamy... a pure fruit beer if there ever were one.  Really this is one of the best pure fruit beers Ive had, not candy-like, not overly sweet, it lets the natural sourness of the cherries come through, from the juicy, green flavors of under-ripe bing cherries to the tart, plum-like flavors you find in over-ripe black cherries.  Has a lingering, rich and creamy finish.  Bit of a faint nose at first with a full glass, though when theres some room in there, when its about 1/4 full, the rich, ripe black cherries and little notes of wood and vanilla and cream show up big time... overall this beer is just an incredible use of fruit, and deserves the praise it has received..","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
4212,"2007-04-14",4.4,"Hand-bottle sampled in Nov. 2006: Pours a dark ruby mahogany with a thin wispy off-white head.  Rich, sweet, full cherry and caramel malty aroma.  Body starts thick and fruity with a great balance of sweet malt and cherries with a tart earthy fruitiness and doughy yeastiness with a hint of cinnamon.  Great complexity and fullness of palate.  An awesome kriek!","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
4212,"2007-02-25",4.0,"Hand bottled by kramer17801 (Thanks!) - Now this is a REAL beer head, huge meringue like texture, falling very slowly leaving the most beautiful pattern of laces on its way, the head and the body are both redbrown (of cause not with the same density in color); European vers. American, the aroma of this beer is to me very American, lots of cherry but super sweet almost with cinnamon sprinkled on top, lots of barrel but in a very vanilla sweet kind of way, it has some fresh cherry as well but the cinnamon, vanilla sweetness is taking over and makes it a bit to fat and vulgar; Huge carbonation in quite funny body, it has a soft almost velvety texture but quite a bit of balanced acid hides it well, at first there are great amounts of lactic acids but when the beer is swallowed they seem much more like the fruit acids of an unripe cherry mixed up with the lactics, somehow it has quite some reminiscence of some Flemish Oude Bruins; it finishes very long with lots of American (haha) aromas: vanilla and cinnamon sweetness with a big punch of allspice and a little clove on a dry almost ORVAL like textured body, with a late oaky harshness. Great beer, like nothing I have ever tasted before. To my taste it needs a little work to be perfect, but it is definitely on its way.","Aarhus, DENMARK","henrikb"
4212,"2006-12-26",4.1,"12/26/06.  Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, obtained as a generous gift from kramer17801 on RateBeer 12/1/06.  Hand-bottled.  Deep burnt brown-red color with a gigantic, frothy and fluffy pink-tan head that lingers in a gentle pillow.  Meringue-like lumpiness almost on the level of Chouffe Houblon and the best bottles of Orval.  Lovely, slow and sticky, doily-like swaths of lacing glide down the edges of the glass.  Aroma is vaguely wine-like and slightly acetic, propping up a cherry pie essence muted with some pale doughy ""flabbiness"" and a soft outline of oak-vanilla.  Reminiscent of Flemish sours moreso than any kriek Ive come across; not as acidic as either, and not nearly as funky as a traditional kriek.  Theres a literally breathtaking tart-cherry-oak-wood combo that rears its head on deep whiffs.  Flavor starts appropriately fairly mild with dark cherry-skin followed by an expansion of cherry-vanilla and drying woody, pitty earth flavors.  The tartness at work here is really a fruity tartness, like from underripened cherries, rather than an acid formed as a fermentation byproduct; theres a notable lack of much bretty funk or that REALLY stinging, dry acidity found in the beers of Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen (for instance) to pierce through the slick body.  Still, thats not a bad thing.  Its damn fine stuff, actually.  Finish lasts quite a long time and really rounds out the full cherry experience-- pits, skins, juicy fleshy suggestions from across the entire over-/under-/perfectly-ripe spectrum.  In the land of cherry beers, this is only slightly akin to the cherry candy and pie-filling sweetness of New Glarus Belgian Red, but with a tremendous amount more fruitiness than traditional krieks can ever proffer.  At times it takes a little searching and thoughtful reflection to allow the various shades of fruit to reveal themselves, but Ive never been above that.  Some dark green leafy vegetal quality in the finish is the only thing that really detracts.  When left alone after a good, big gulp, the lingering tartness seems to call up mouthwatering blips of new flavors in wonderful harmony.  Medium body with that kind of fluffy carbonated texture that gently massages your tongue.  A very unique, very ambitious product.  Just dont let the name fool you.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

4212,"2006-11-09",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 28, 2007 Notes from KSB 06 growler pour (thanks Jason!!) and some extra notes from a handbottle.  Pours a deep mahagony red, woody, and a very thin head- low carbonation.  Aroma is cherry, almonds, sugary syrup, cough medicine, and a slight sour note.  Flavor is initially slightly tart with lots of fresh whole red cherries, wierd cherry fruit roll-up character.  Then it  gets a lot of pithy almond-like astringency from the pits of the cherries which is ok but leaves a weird aftertaste.  A bit richer and fuller in flavor and cherry-ness than the NG belgian red, but way more astringent.  Still, a very unique and tasty beer.
