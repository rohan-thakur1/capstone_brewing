2610,"2015-12-03",2.3,"Pint can from Liquor Barn (Jefferson Commons); shared with my Boo. Aroma: More rose than I was expecting; lighter gum and banana. Appearance: Slightly hazy gold pour with healthy carbonation holding up a foamy white head, which settles into a patchy skin. Flavor: Obtrusive rose up front with some gum/banana coming in thereafter; rose sticks around for the finish, which is semi-dry. Palate: Medium body, sticky texture, lively carbonation, abrupt finish. Overall: Didnt like the rose presence at all, wouldve preferred a straight up Kristallweizen, of which a multitude of examples is lacking in our market. Boo said it was ""terrible,"" and that she ""wouldve given it a zero if possible.""","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"
2610,"2015-12-01",3.6,"Dont have a ton to say about this, since its pretty much just like a goodish Hefeweizen. I didnt really notice the rose, perhaps because my cans werent super fresh, but its a nice effort regardless.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
2610,"2015-10-18",3.8,"Roses come through in the aroma and there is a light sweetness at the end as well. Pours clear gold. A bit bitter and nicely crisp. Courtesy of Brandon and Monica in 2015.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","ads135"
2610,"2015-08-24",3.4,"Clear, golden pour with a white head. The aroma has wheat along with some fruitiness, mostly banana. It has a light, crisp body with lively carbonation. The taste is sweet with a quick finish.","OFallon, Illinois, USA","Finhead"
2610,"2015-08-22",3.5,"16 ounce can, bottom is stamped ""Pull by 11/10/2015"". Served in a weizen glass, the beer pours a hazy light gold color with about a couple inch frothy white head. Head retention is good, and theres a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like wheat/grainy malt, clove, bubblegum and some floralness. I think the taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, its all wheat/graininess, clove, bubblegum, rose/floralness, and a bit of peppery spice. The addition of the rose oil puts an interesting twist to this brew. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, its easy to drink with moderate carbonation. I thought it was nice and refreshing, Id like to try it again sometime in the future.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

It finishes lightly to moderately sweet, lightly bitter and lightly tart. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Peppery taste with notes of lemon, clove and floral hops.
