1975,"2009-05-31",3.7,"On tap at brewery. 5oz sampler. Black. Aroma is really sweet and syrupy. It was interestingly surprising. Aroma was also roasted malt. Taste is roasted malt and still that great syrupy sweetness. Some bitterness was felt and some hints of hops maybe (not sure). Very nice. I felt it would make a nice stout to drink with deserts because of its syrupy sweetness.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

1975,"2007-03-05",3.8,"Dark-brown-not-quite-black body topped by a small tan head.  The cacao, berries and brown sugar flavours work very well together.  A bit floury.  Somewhat sticky but very nice body texture.  Carbonation level is excellent.  Very nice mouthfeel.  7% is apparent but not more.  Kind of felt like a cross between a fruity stout and a scotch ale.

1975,"2006-09-07",3.4,"Draught glass at the brewpub on 8/26/06.Thick-looking, fudge-colored deep brown/black body is opaque, with some magenta-orange hues on the edges and a small, but neat, dark beige head.  Some moderate lacing as it proceeds down the glass, and strong retention.Oats and chocolate-tipped cigars rise up from the glass, not challengingly so, but luxuriously and seductively.  Moves towards chocolate-covered raisins, with a hint of Spanish coffee-like intrigue.  This might also be taken as sharpness, but the unfiltered nature and the gummy thickness really make it difficult to come off as sharp.  Some pale sugars and a creamy vanilla note are stronger as it warms, with light alcohol apparent.A medium body, quite well-attenuated for a foreign/export stout, is immediately apparent, and although there is a chewy, fudge-like texture, the sweetness doesnt match, allowing it to go down rather easily and appear more watery than it really is.  Bits of coffee beans, but mostly dry fudge, chocolate-covered raisins, hints of vanilla and a touch of alcohol bite.  Carbonation is moderate, not quite as soft and tight as it could be, leading to more of a spritzy sensation and less a creamy one.  Dark fruits are lightly apparent, mixing with the alcohol, as it warms and becoming intertwined with residual sweetness.  Though I should note, this is hardly overt in its alcohol apparency, just slightly noticeable.  Some minty/grassy hops grace the palate through the middle of the flavor, but are otherwise completely lacking.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1975,"2006-01-03",3.0,"Beautiful black robe, with no chill haze to dull it up, and a somewhat decent mocha head that slowly tapered away at around the half-pint point.
The usual combo of cocoa and coffee, the fusel alcohol then creeps up on you quite cool and solvent-like in the nose, with plums and other dark fruits in the mix.
Smooth carbonation, nice roasted malt and decent body, however it sort of turns to ashes in the finale, leaving it dry and a little flat in the end.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"

Opaque black body is topped by a low but lasting, large bubbled, brown head that recedes to a partial cover with some lacing.  Very strong roastiness with liquorice and grape notes up front in the flavour.  Chocolate emerges mid-mouth without being overly sweet.  Strong roasty bitterness lingers in the finish.

1975,"2005-10-31",3.8,"Undoutedly black pour, forming a beautifully lacing dense tan head. Oatmeal like apparently thick nose. Sweetish floury, faintly fruity and dark malty flavors. Rounded palate though quite airy, progressive carbonation. Not very complex, but a mouthfull of dark malts with impeccable balance between the mellow cofee-like roastiness and sweet chocolate/vanilla kiss. Highly drinkable for its size.

1975,"2005-10-02",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2009 The Lure:Dark chocolate and fruity molasses rise slowly above the sticky lacing. Mostly sweet and roasty, but never outgoing, you can easily perceive that something rich resides within.

The Festivities:A decadent, rich mouthfeel with dark chocolate and molasses recalls Bièropholies Imperial Stout. Balanced, as all Bedondaine beers, with mild fruitiness and delicate roasted malt bitterness as a contour to the lip-smacking malt sweetness. Not exactly to any style, and I love it.

Transcendence:Sturdy walls offer warming protection.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

Excellent flavor of chocolate, cherries and strong, dominant roasted malt, strong bitter finish. I like that the malt is so strong and dominating, amazing.
