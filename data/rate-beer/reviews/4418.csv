4418,"2017-01-09",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2017 At Cantillon, 75 cl bottle from 2016. One of their recent grape lambic ventures, with thin, moussy, dirty pinkish white head leaving a stable rim, deep wine red colour with warmer ruby hue, hazy. Aroma of dry red wine and sweet blue grapes but also stewed plums, stale urine, grape pits, fermenting gooseberries, sweet tomatoes, moldy cellar, blackberry juice, fruit yoghurt. Vivid and rich fruity onset, lots of stewed stonefruit as well as red berries, sour with a thin lemony acidity but not harshly puckering, more soft lactic and fruit tartness, dry and juicy at the same time with a bready wheat backbone, drying finish with some musty cellar-like funk, grape pit oil and tannins, as well as a late, explicit, bit wry bitterness (probably a combination of earthy hops and grape tannins); at the same time, however, and old red wine- and sweeter grape juice-like brightness lingers. Funky but not overly so, sour but not puckering, juicy and dry all at once, this is yet another pretty Cantillon lambic, but perhaps a little bit subdued and less expressive than some others; I personally prefer Saint-Lamvinus slightly over this one. Nevertheless very interesting, glad I tasted it.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
4418,"2016-12-29",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed at Cantillon on November 10. 750 mL bottle, 2015 vintage shared with Kathleen. The pour is a nice deep ruby with a thin ring of egg shell colored head and no real lace to be found. The aroma is incredibly jammy. I love it. There is a Cantillon funk that is just lovely and a ton of fruitiness on the front end. The yeasty barnyard comes through on the back end, but this is a great balance. The flavor is just as good. The jamminess and the funk balance perfectly. There is a light tart wineyness that is delightful. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a great bright carbonation and a lingeringly dusty and fruity finish. This is just great. I like it a lot!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Not ""grapey"", with the fruit nicely integrated and yet very bright, apparent and intense. Seems like a very good grape for lambic blending, having high acidity and also tons of subtle complexities. Light tannin, black pepper and more plastery minerality on the end with no alcohol or flaw.Tart acidity in the mouth shows lots of poignant red fruits; grape, raspberry, tart cherry and such. Light lactic acid mixes with very soft fruit juiciness to give a good sweet/sour element. Cherry, mint, pepper and grapeskin all balance the malt/wheat character nicely as tartness is well-controlled on the end, finishing with lip-smacking, tart, juiciness. Very unlike Cantillons other fruit lambics and it strikes me as still quite young, with the grape character, while enjoyable, still a bit forward and needing more time to meld with the lambic. No doubt this should be a knockout for years to come.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Flowers drape grapes in this citric, funky Fruit Lambic.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam decorates the dark pink.
-A very slight pediococcus viscosity had begun to take hold of this bottle.
-The aroma is bright and engaging.
-Acidity is high, but not too intense.
-Drinkability is very high.

Pours a ruby, saturated red color, with a decent fizzy head.

Smells incredible wine forward, with fermented grapes, horse blanket and a tartness of fermented red grapes. Almost got a whiff of cherries to it, resulting from earthy, slighty sweeter stone qualities.

Has a fitting medium carbonation, with a tart refreshing mouthfeel.

Tastes of tart, young grapes among earthy, dusty malts, while the acidic sourness hovers shamelessly above anything else. Dont got much body to it, while its fermented, vinous flavors convince on their own. Finishes with ripe grape qualities, integrating a gentle counterpoint to the tartness by adding a sweet fruit note to the taste. 

Overall the beer compensates its lack of depth beautifully by the very convincing, well pronounced red grape appearance. This comes as close to wine as I have experienced so far in a beer, while the grape flavor is defined by a wild sourness, without adding much else. Creates an unusual straight forward lambic, with the typical Cantillon Lambic foundation.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Light, delicate mouthfeel, gentle acidity, definitely on the dryer side when compared to the other two. another stunning grape lambic from Cantillon.

Some faint, fresh green herb; old wood. Very vinous, red wine, hints at sweetness (!) midst all the fruit- and lactic sourness. Grapeskin flavours, prominent. Wild lambicyeasts, yet quite mild - superb!! Again a strange leafy fruit in the aftertaste. Light, overattenuated body, quite a bit spritzy. WOW! This is an absolute topper, even to Cantillon standards.  Many, MANY thanks to the Vermeersch bros!","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
4418,"2015-03-18",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2015 Bouteille 75cl @ Cantillon, embouteillée en Nov. 2014, lambic de Dec. 2012? 2 ans dage venant du lot P19.
De couleur rougeâtre voire acajou, un col rosâtre effervescent retombant rapidement.
Arôme met de suite laccent sur un cépage fruité aux notes assez tenaces. Ce bouquet me rappel un peu le profil du Pineau dAunis lorsque cette dernière était encore fort jeune. Les senteurs sont agréables chargées en fruité de raisin avec un rétro-nasal portant les notes habituelles dun lambic Cantillon. Retrouve une senteur légèrement boisée avec une petite note de tanin, léger funk. Ici, le raisin brille par sa complexité.
Palais sur une effervescence moyenne voire haute. Le profil est également fortement centré sur le fruité, le tout étant sec, finement acidulé et plus suret. Le cépage donne une certaine profondeur au corps avec une composante vineuse qui y ajoute un caractère appréciable. On note quasiment ce côté fruit entier avec un caractère de peau tannique de ce raisin. Lambic forcément encore dans sa jeunesse et dont les vertus acidulées seront intéressantes à déguster - si les bouteilles ne se vendent pas avant. Il me hâte de voir ce que Jean a dans ses recettes avec dautres cépages, notamment des vignobles italiens ou croates.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
4418,"2015-03-15",4.8,"750 ml. bottle @ brewery. Labeled & commercially sold. Same type of yellow label as the recent Pinot dAnuis bottles. This beer came appeared out of nothing for me. Bottle says lambiek December 2012. Bottled November 2014. It is carbonated. Apparently this one uses Carignan grapes from Mas dAgalis in South of France. Pours a very deep dark ruby red, ruby red grapes, head is deep pink at first but quickly vanishes to only some bubbles on the side of the glass. Nose is huge tannic very dry red grapes, some fruit sweetness, light mineral quality, touch vinous alcohol, cranberries jam, lots of very dry oak. Taste is lots of very dry oak in a real wine forward way followed by Cantillon funk, dry cork, tannic very dry red grapes, grape skins, tannic wine, huge amount of oak, lots of very red grapes combined with Cantillon funk. Extremely dry, oak-forward & very red wine forward. Typical lively but not overtly so Cantillon carbonation. Out of all the Cantillon wine experiments I have had, this one is by far the most wine-like. I cannot expect any beer to come closer to being a lambiek & wine hybrid in terms of flavor. It has such typical very dry oak wine qualities combined with very wine-like tannic dry grapes & Cantillon funk. For anyone equally into wine & lambiek this must be heaven. Fresh already this beats Saint Lamvinus at its own game, Saint Lamvinus astronomically improves at 2 years old in my opinion. Bonus points for the shear success of the experiment.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
