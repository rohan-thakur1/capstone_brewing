3259,"2017-04-14",3.7,"Bottle (tagged 2016/08/30): Poured translucent to slightly cloudy deep gold with a bubbly white calming head, sediment. Classic aroma of Belgian yeast, fruity esters, banana, coriander/spice, banana, and light floral notes. Sweet taste, alcohol traces, bit of spiciness. Medium body, oily to watery, light dry finish and a really nice effervescent lively carbonation thats not over the top. Overall: Longstanding classic, true to the style and easy-drinking. Just a touch too much sweetness for my personal liking.","Ontario, CANADA","DanDan_"

3259,"2014-12-28",4.1,"The experience starts with the 500ml custom bottle and its distinctive artwork that I think is pretty cool and stands out on the shelves. At first glance, you have a foggy golden robe showing tons of fine bubbles topped by an eggshell head that I found very airy. The head slowly shifts to a thin layer and offers a minimal rough lacing. The nose is aromatic and spicy with notes of fresh cilantro and grainy malt presence. Youll also get a sweaty or soapy undertone from the yeasts that I personally found less interesting. The attack is a bit sweet but quickly shifts to bready malts, again with the soapy undertone of the yeasts and a hoppy finale delivering a slight aftertaste. A pleasant warmth and sting from the alcohol gives a nice density and roundness. Kind of surprised the alcohol was so apparent, since only standing at 9% ABV. The mouthfeel is also sharp and dry, contributing to the complexity of the product. Overall this is a good full-bodied, robust triple I found interesting and a beer you could shelf for up to 3 years to make it develop complexity.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Beardbeerman"

The nose it primarily yeast and yeast notes like leather, dough, horse blanket, but then a subtle sweetness comes through; something like apple and maybe a little citrus.

Aroma has some complexity and is fairly pungent: big cereal aroma with spice, fruits, some fusel and earthy funk from Belgian yeast. Peppery tongue, chewy mouth feel. Flavor profile starts with some big complexity malts mingle with succulent fruity tones, spice, herbs, woodiness, mid palate this dries up to become very much like a tart pear cider, then goes to a dry fruity finish and a light hop bite at the end  then some subtle warming. Very drinkable Abby style triple with decent complexity, however, still has some sharp edges on it - I suspect it would develop moreround rounded character with some cellar aging.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"

The flavour is moderately sweet with lots of citrus, spice and yeast, along with honey and piney hops. The finish is moderate in length, peppery and yeasty. On the palate, it is medium in body, with a slightly dry texture and average carbonation. Overall, a very nice tripel. Alcohol is well hidden and flavours are quite complex.

What is the point of adding tons of totally fermentable sugars if you dont allow them, in one way or another, to ferment out? A ""triple""- Flemish strong blonde ought to be bone DRY.

Not a particulary good interpretation of a Belgian Strong Blonde. Very New World.   Merci quand-même, Luc!

3259,"2006-04-25",3.7,"2004 bottle.  Either from MartinT or purchased by myself at Johanette, cant remember.  Shared with SuIIy on 4/24/06Lively, bottle conditioned pour with tons of sediment left in the bottom of the bottle shows a sparkling, deep copper with plenty of bronze tints, tiny bubbles rising and a large, frothy, fluffy white head that is magnificently well-retained and provides ample lacing.The nose is very clean, with a mildly mineralic yeastiness, soft bubble gum and light lemons providing contrast.  Wheat seems to be present, adding a dignified smoothness with a light creaminess.  Hints of caramel, and just minimally phenolic, with a strong perfuminess on the end perhaps from the alcohol.  Im positive that I couldnt discern this from a motherland trippel if given it blind.  The nose is just so well balanced and with such a clean, fluffy yeast.  Add a bit more yeast and malt complexity and it would be right up there with the best.The flavor, however, is surprisingly much sweeter than the aroma lets on.  Dry biscuit malts from the nose are lost in a strong current of caramel and pils malt sweetness that contains dots of peppery phenols (clove and black pepper being the most distinct) and a bubble gum/cotton candy flavor on the end that is sweet and sugary as well.  Carbonation is very prominent at first, expanding too quickly in the mouth, though providing relief from the heavily sweet malts.  It settles out a bit too loosely, there didnt seem to be much middle ground here.  Bread, dough, pepper and vanilla-meets-honey flavors all abound.  Finish is dried out by the alcohol and light phenols.  Im surprised to see this ranked higher than 8eme Jour, that one seemed, at least to me, to be much more balanced, lively and crisp, while not relying on the alcohol for dryness.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Flavour is similar, dry alcohol, lightly fruity character, modest malt with mild caramel and toasted malt notes. 7+ Smooth average palate has a soft carbonation to it which is pleasant but Id prefer more weight to it. Significantly less malty than I remember, which is to its detriment for my tastes. 7/3/7/3/15 - 3.5 Bottle at Volo, Toronto
2004-08-XX. Hazy golden copper with a big fluffy white head. Aroma is sweetly alcoholic and slightly yeasty. Fairly sweet on the palate with some toffee like candi sugar. Touch of alcohol in the finish. Some spice in the profile mixes so beautifully that it didnt really stick out in my mind. Palate is quite nice, with the effervescence making it stupidly easy to drink for such a high octane brew. A very nice, slightly out of the ordinary triple. Id may have to find me another... 8/4/8/4/16  - 4.0 Bottle shared with Mustang3","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"

3259,"2004-08-06",3.9,"Pours an orange brown with a thick head. Aromas of pepper, apples, corriander and belgian yeast. The flavours were quite full. Pepper, apples, leather, and a fairly good hop bite. Well concealed alcohol.A nice belgian, thanks Rasta!","coquitlam, British Columbia, CANADA","frink"
3259,"2004-07-19",3.8,"Hazy rustic orange color with a diminished beige head. Ornage caramel and coriander aromas mix nicely. HInts of licorice and alcohol as it warms and settles. Not really a triple but an enjoyable belgium strong of sorts, mixed between a quad, and a triple. Actually after the last pour, with the yeast, some light qualities towards a triple do emerge. Fruits and spices, licorice and leather. A solid complex ale. A touch heavy and sticky in feel, at least for a triple. A good beer by any other name...  Kudos to Rastacouere.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
3259,"2004-07-19",3.8,"500ml bottle.  Vibrant ruby-orange with a dense, fully-lasting, cream-coloured head that leaves nice lacing.  Aroma is fruity, yeasty, bready, and spicy with notes of green banana.  Light-to-medium body with a soft, refined mouthfeel.  Fruity flavour is relatively dry and grainy with a lot of orange peel character and quite a peppery, spicy kick at the finish.  Deceptively drinkable considering its strength.  Well-crafted and interesting.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Wheatsheaf"
3259,"2004-05-23",4.3,"Just short of amazing. Lots of fruit salad in aroma: peaches, apricos, bananas. All of those flavors plus pecans and apples in flavor. Some marshmallow and yeasty notes as well. Mellow, somewhat sticky, grainy, herbal finish. I would love to have more. The only thing I would like better is more wheat/grain essence.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
3259,"2004-05-22",3.4,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2010 Bottled Mar. 17, 2010: Pale gold. Thick white foam spatters the glass with ornate lacework after each sip. Muddled aroma of sulfur, dusty yeast, candy sugar/rum, pear, and dried pineapple. Floral, herbal hops struggle to overcome the slightly metallic/sulfurous and vanilla cake notes. Touch of gum. Creamy and delicate on the tongue. Slick with an immediate push of gullet-warming alcohol which augments the peppery hop elements. Displays some promising notes of obligatory-to-style Juicy Fruit gum notes at the center, which are clean and fluffy, but that quickly succumbs to an unpleasant metallic zing and overt pear, white grape, and vanilla cake sugariness. Malt remains very clean and supportive as it lends an ever so faint piecrust suggestion. Dab of restrained clove harmoniously fuses with the gum without ever hampering any of the delicacies. Pervasive sulfur taints the characteristically subtle nature of this style with an overwhelming scratchiness which is apparent from start to finish. Closes spicily estery and hoppy yet relentlessly alcoholic and on the sugary side. A bit too sweet, flabby, and alcoholic, but a very respectable stab at one of the more difficult styles to execute. 

Review of 2004 bottle: Unfiltered apricot. Fat and rocky, off-white head with plenty of sticky lacework. Invigorating aroma of coriander, chalk, and juicy esters. Fragrant herbal hop and mineral wafts along with sweet, bready malts. Expansive, creamy carbonation. Becomes feathery soft as it breathes. Spicy anise, coriander, and tight esters in the flavor with a continual citrusy, flowery  expression. Tropical fruits dominate the center, but are delicately balanced with a soft citrusy, pillowy malt anchor. Clean, minty alcohol is the perfect match for the herbal notes. As the fruitiness wanes, a delayed spice surge exudes over a zesty hop/tangy herb anchor. Well-placed candy sugar  matches the sweet maltiness while complementing the  assorted fruits and herbal twang. Finishes velvety soft and moist with a medley of coriander, tangy herbs and juicy citrus flavors. This epitomizes cohesion with its elegance, balance, and complexity. A beautiful Triple.

3259,"2004-05-22",3.8,"Bottle pours dirty amber, quickly diminishing frothy white head, fine yeasty bits floating about, with very little lacing.   Very sweet floral and citrus aroma.   Bubblegum as well.   Forwardly sweet on the tongue, slightly tin flavored, more floral notes.   This isnt quite like any tripel I have had, quite fruity and floral. &nbsp Taste is very consistant with the aroma. &nbsp The 9% is very well hidden.   Decent body, good mouthfeel, quite enjoyable this one is.   Thanks goes out to rastacouere for the trade!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
3259,"2004-05-20",4.0,"Very appealing amber color with a small head and strong carbonation. Fruity and spicy aroma. Fruity (feels like banana) and spicy (mostly coriander, maybe pepper too) flavors. Very round mouthfeel. I dont think that this beer is a triple, but it is very good.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
3259,"2004-05-05",4.5,"The beautiful beer poured a hazy amber with a rather large foamy head. Lacing was just fantastic. Top that off with fantastic carbonation. This one was a looker! The nose on this was simply divine. Citrus comes out in the form of lemon or grapefruit. Spices aplenty. Youve got to love coriander. The hop profile is very delectable. Then come the flavors. The hops come roaring out like a madman. Big citrus and bitterness. The coriander blends the hops together fantastically. Very nice yeast background. The alcohol is very well hidden. Palate is nice and sticky, a big body and a bitter finish to a wonderful Triple. Thanks Rastacouere!","Seattle, Washington, USA","Sham"
3259,"2004-05-05",4.2,"Lots of hazy auburn colors, heavy carbonation, full rich creamy tan head. Sticky lacing; top notch for appearance. The aroma is delicious with some sweetness & dry matching. Coriander, citrus, yeast, pilsner malts, hops, fresh, clean, beautiful. The flavor is a tad on the bitter side, very spicy & full of yeast. Good to style, almost no alcohol coming through. The blend here is very classy. Matching the spices, malts, hops, yeast, carbonation, alcohol, dry sweet. Beer nirvana. Finishes with light acidity like lemons with a hoppy coriander bite. Super Yummy! Thanks Rastacouere and Sham!","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3259,"2004-04-14",3.9,"Mildly hazy copper with a puffy and well-lacing white head.  Spiced almost like a wit in the aroma with plenty of bready Belgian yeast to back it up.  Very smooth and caramely sweet body has a subtle spice to it and good balance.  Finishes semi-sweet, dry and warming, but hides the alcohol fairly well.  A very nice triple that I thank Rastacouere for trading to me.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3259,"2004-03-29",3.6,"(500ml bottle0 Pours a medium, white head and a cloudy, copper body. Nose of spiced fruit, somewhat citrus. As with the Ambree - I cannot help but think these are more wheat beers in flavour? Nice weiss finish. Good.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
3259,"2004-03-14",4.4,"Amazing orange-brown and very cloudy beer. Nice white brew. Complex fruity and spicy (coriander) aroma. The alcohol is perfectly hidden. Long and moderately bitter final. Wonderful beer!!!","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"
3259,"2004-03-03",3.3,"500 ml bottle.  Golden bright semi-opacity with a firm snowy topping.  Luscious caramel and orange in the nose, yeast makes it a bit pungent.  Medium body, sweet, rich, earthy, lightly spicy, no alcohol whatsoever.  Nice but missing something -- just a bit dull and flatfooted, with a quick and uninteresting finish.  ""Good for the price"" I guess, but in a tripel I'm looking for something more.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
3259,"2004-03-02",3.6,"Pretty nice amber colour  with the yeast and spice I'm coming to expect from this little brewery. Seems like maybe they have a preferred spiciness that is a bit of a signature. This one is malty too and has more citrus evident to me on the nose and flavour. Seems thin for a tripel, sort of a ""light"" strong ale, although the alcohol is present in a smoothly warming way. Nice.","Oshawa, Ontario, CANADA","beerhugger"
3259,"2004-02-27",3.7,"Deep amber in colour.  Aroma was yeasty, spicy, with oranges, lemons, peaches and pepper.

3259,"2004-02-10",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 15, 2004 The color is amazing: a deep orange with a bit of brown. This beer has got fruity and peppery characteristics. No hop and good malt is present. Citrus fruit flavor is very present but well balanced with malt. A very good beer in my opinion. The only problem with it being that it gets sold too fast and the brewery cannot keep up with the demand!","Quebec, CANADA","PrimeMinister"
3259,"2003-10-08",4.0,"Bottle.  Golden orange color with a laced off-white head.  A strong citrus and orange peel aroma, accented by pepper, corriander, sweet candy, and yeast.  A sweet and slightly dry triple with a nice delicate flavor.  A real treat, thanks, Rastacouere.","San Francisco, California, USA","jazz88"
3259,"2003-09-16",3.6,"UPDATED: FEB 17, 2004 Beautiful deep golden color with a fine good-laced white head that stays long, fed by much above average carbonation for a triple. The aroma is malty sweet of caramel and peppery oranges. Very sweet triple with caramelic malt, big orange, apple, alcohol tones. Probably Charlevoix's yeastiest beer (in what I've had anyway). The finish is less interesting, tired hops provides a little wet paperboard bitter taste.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
