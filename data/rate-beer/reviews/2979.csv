2979,"2014-09-17",3.0,"""For a malt liquor stylized beer, this is up there. Still tasted a little of sweet corn and alcohol but with a good body. Golden hued, slightly hoppy and fairly sweet. Ok...""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
2979,"2012-05-30",2.8,"Its malt liquor...by law it should be cheap, sweet, and get you f**ked up pretty darn fast.  This is no exception.  Coppery colored with absolutely no head.  On tap at the brewery.  Smells sweet, like corn syrup and sugar-water.  Tastes even sweeter, lots of residual sugars with very little bitterness...even then it would seem that it comes mainly from the alcohol which seems to leave a bit of a bite.  Leaves a sweet and corny aftertaste.  Beats Old-8ball hands down. Matches the style very well, however the style in itself is absolutely horrific.","Washington, USA","22415brewery"
2979,"2011-09-18",2.9,"Draft @ Uber; 2011 vintage; crystal clear faint gold with trace white head; light corn, super drinkable, light malt, a little more burn going down than I remember from previous vintages; sweet dry malt, lemons with a little corn in the finish; digging the slight twang in the nose; decent craft edition overall but like most, far from the real deal","Seattle, Washington, USA","SuzyGreenberg"
2979,"2011-08-25",3.0,"Draft.  Clear light amber body, small off-white head.  Aroma is moderately sweet, bread, corn.  Taste is moderately sweet, orange, corn, some bread.  Medium-full body, light stickiness.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
2979,"2011-06-17",3.7,"A light sweet aroma. This is a pretty easy-drinking beer. A good starter for the day. Very smooth for a malt liquor.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
2979,"2010-02-18",3.7,"Clear golden color/ white head. Nice lagered ,yeasty pils malt aromas. Rich, full mouthfeel. Good pils malt, lightly toasted sweet corn flakes flavors with light spicy hops. Bottle this shit in 40oz  I wanna drink it every day knee gras","Same Trailer, Different Park, Louisiana, USA","AmEricanbrew"
2979,"2010-02-06",3.9,"Hoo-yeah!  Sunflower, bright, cheerful aroma.  Sunny vibrant gold.  Great clean corn character, not too sweet, not too dry.  Finishes a bit leafy, a touch sweet, and works out great for me.","Bothell, Washington, USA","scrizzz"
2979,"2010-01-25",2.8,"draft at malt and vine. pours a crystal clear medium gold with the scantest white ring. no legs or lace. sharp tingly nose, corny sweet and a little loosely boozy. creamy medium body, lively carb. artichokey mid palate, crackery and corny. very much an adjunct lager.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2979,"2010-01-13",2.9,"Shaker pint draft at Naked City Taphouse in Seattle, Washington. pour is a clear darker golden with a smallish white head. Aroma of corn along with light sweet malt.  Behind that is a touch of floral sweetness. Cleanish nose. Taste is sharp on the corn sweetness - tastes like a malt liquor should I guess. Flavor is aided by a nice floral grassiness to the finish. As it warms, an almost grapey sweetness comes out. When warm, the sweetness was a bit too much for me.  Palate is medium to thin bodied with a decent carbonation level.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
2979,"2010-01-13",3.7,"on tap at elysian fields, got to have two pints thanks to super generous group. Really enjoyable, malts present but not overpowering. Somewhat barleywine ish without being overly sweet.","Seattle, Washington, USA","carruthm"
2979,"2010-01-03",3.3,"Tap at Elysian FIelds before Hawks game. Was awesome to see Chris Johnson go over 2000 on our crap ass team Hoo fucking ray! Nose is sweet, corny with cidery notes, a hint of bread, and grass too. Pours golden orange, thin foam, a little lace. Sweet flavors of corn, apple cider, grainy malts, light grass. Lingering sugary sweetness. Definitely to style.  I would prefer more aggression in my malt liquor, as well as alcohol. It was a palatable malt liquor in the mold of Magnum or King Cobra.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
2979,"2010-01-02",3.3,"Hell yeah, new batch bitches!  Draft at capital hill.  Pours dark golden with not much in the way of a head...just a small creamy halo.  Nose is pretty tame.   What I do get is faint sweetness with a touch of apple, light husky grain with some fresh unsalted corn nuts.  The flavor is also refined for a malt liqour...maybe this was made for the fixie riders?   Somewhat sweet, husky grain and fresh sweet corn.  Honestly though, this is a craft malt liqour and is pretty well done.","Washington, USA","bvc"
2979,"2008-08-23",2.7,"Sampled at Tangle town a few years back.  I don’t like malt liquor.  But, suffice to say, they pretty much hit this one on the nose.  Sticky, corny, and syrupy...everything a ""good"" (?) malt liquor should be! Don’t drink it warm...YUCK.","Earth, Washington, USA","skoisirius"
2979,"2006-04-20",3.2,"Draught; brewed at Elysian Tangletown  Pure gold; good white head. Citrussy, vinous as white Chardonnay wine, also cedarwood. Corn, maize taste and alcoholic in the finish. Slick, maize and alcoholwarming building up the palate. Excellent for a malt liquor, but all in all, only the nose is great. Still makes up for the best malt liquor Ive ever tasted. Not that that would be difficult.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
2979,"2006-03-19",2.0,"Golden colour.  Appley, unionmade aroma.  Apple and malt character with light bready notes.  This is followed by overwhelming raunch.  Yeah, I thought it was clean but after it warmed up a bit its damn nasty.  Too many high alcohol and dirty yeast notes.  Well, its authentic, bitch.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
2979,"2006-03-13",0.9,"On tap at the brewery.  The only way to describe this is ""authentic"".  Deep golden colour, thin white head.  Stinky corn and fusel aroma.  A bit garbagy as well (DMS).  Flavour is pretty neutral when it first leaves the tap, but once it hits 10 degrees, its pure crap.  Thin cidery body, corn and fusels.  Nothing good about this... but I gather thats the point.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
2979,"2006-02-19",2.3,"On tap at Tangletown. I asked the server what his favourite was. Mistake. 

Pint arrived full to the top with zero head, but a bit of lace left. Smell was nice and lagery, but it smells as if maybe it was fermented with ale yeast instead of lager yeast. Hoppy smell, but a bit thin. Willamette? Dunno. Colour was deep amber, and promising. Of all the Elysian beers, this is the only one I dont really like. Far to sweet, made to please the standard palate that doesnt really like beer. Or hops. I found it a bit sweet, and actually had trouble finishing it before going back to the Phatty Imperial Red.","Ucluelet, British Columbia, CANADA","natrat"
2979,"2006-02-18",2.3,"Brewed at Tangletown. Clear golden with not much head. Very light and sweet...refreshing. Good for what it is.","Seattle, Washington, USA","glkaiser"
