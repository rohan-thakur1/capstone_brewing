3525,"2015-04-02",3.6,"Pour on tap at the brewery, dark reddish brown pour with thin off white head, aroma brought notes of bread, toast, some red fruits into a bit of cocoa, slight earthy notes with a slight grassy note.

3525,"2014-11-20",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Caramel, earthen truffles and toasted cereals move into minerals and leafy hop bitterness in this lean Dark Mild.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam laces around the gleaming ruby brown.
-Fruity angles are also found.
-This is not sweet at all; just lots of clean malt flavors and balancing hops.
-Carbonation could be softer (this one deserves a handpump too!).

3525,"2012-08-03",3.6,"Growler shared by Thorpe429 and Amyliz4. Thanks Mike and Amy! This kicked off a nice day of brewing.

A: Toffee brown color with orange highlights and a half inch of light tan head. The head had good retention and left some nice lacing on the glass.

S: The aroma is fairly weak, with some subtle hints of toffee and malt in the English style.

T: The beer is very tasty and flavorful, with enjoyable light roast and a very mild bitterness. The beer is just ever so slightly sweet. This is a really well done brew. Workingman is my first experience with English dark mild ale, so I have no other point(s) of reference, but this seems like a great genre of beer that I will be returning to as soon as possible.

M: Light, thin body, which comes as no surprise with a 3.5% alcohol session beer.

D: Very drinkable. I could throw back several pints of this pretty easily.

3525,"2011-08-24",3.6,"Draft at rev, Finally trying this beer. Sorry I wish more brewpubs offered small beers but I think they should be $3-4, but what do I know. This guy pours ruby red with off white head. Nose has toasted nuts and brown sugar.  Flavors is a bit out of balance on the roasty or better yet toasted side, good amount of bland toasted grain over powers, while some prunes and brown sugar lay underneath. Lots of flavor and good body for a small beer, but the flavor is a bit one dimensional on the toasty side as if its trying to overcompensate for being a small beer. This did grow on me while i drank it but I bet this would play better on cask.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
3525,"2011-04-21",3.6,"On tap at Revolution.

Pours a fairly-dark brown color with a nice off-white to tan head with moderate retention and a nice cap as it falls. The nose brings forward a good dose of roasted malt. Also there is a bit of coffee and mild chocolate. The flavor is a bit more robust than the nose with all components being a bit more pronounced. Some mild bitterness along with the roast in the finish. Light body and really nice drinkability. Certainly a powerful session beer.

You can definitely tell this is lower ABV, but its pretty flavorful for such a light beer. More of an earth throughout with a nice cocoa maltiness. Some more toffee and caramel with a light roasty nut and some floral fruits.

Light bodied and dry enough to quaff en mass.  Pretty simple toasty/malty sweet flavor dynamic.   Not a beer to get in the way of whatever you malt be doing.

3525,"2010-02-20",3.4,"Draft on tap at Revolution (Chicago, IL). Pours a dsrker copper, some sunfire at the bottom, thicker and darker haze, with a good tannish head that dies to a decent level, laces ok. Aromas are some toasty crisp malts, a touch of soapy florals, mild with faint caramel. Initial is lighter bodied, a touch of soapiness, metal, and grainy malts. Some light toastiness, the caramel, if any, is minimal, as this beer isbready, leaning more towards dry toast with some light floral and grassy hops to give it some life. The hops grow on me, delicate with just faint citrus and a mild bitterness, making this beer quite drinkable. No caramel or sweetness taking me down the path of heavier brews, and at 3.5, this beer could be consumed on the regular. The lacing is minimal, but the beer is fresh, grains and hops taste new, amazing what a fresh mild can do. Toasty grains and mild hopped finish. Nice","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
