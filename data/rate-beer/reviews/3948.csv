3948,"2016-07-18",3.6,"This bottled Sake from a bottle shop poured a head of frothy finely sized clear colored bubbles that were very quickly diminishing and left behind a strong bubbly carbonation transparent weak straw yellow colored body. The nice aroma was peach and floral. The bubbly mouth feel was strongly tingly at the start and weakly tingly at the finish with a bubbly fruity aftertaste. The nice flavor contained notes of rice and peach. A decent one that I would consider drinking again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

Rich, soapy sweet peach schnapps and a trickle of that carbonation. Finishes itchy sweet and sedate ricey. Not rough raking sake but everything is a bit one sided sweet.

3948,"2014-03-18",2.2,"Definitely the worst sake so far as this one is more or less just peach juice with a hint of ricewater. Drinkable, but way to sweet and the finish is more than non-pleasing.","Wanne-Eickel, GERMANY","MichaelAwesome"
3948,"2014-03-17",2.5,"Pours out of the bottle in a vanilla-peachy colour with smooth body. Nice aroma of peaches and flowers. Taste of peach juice and flowers but it also has its sake moments when you taste the basmati rice and sweet alcohol. Propably the worst sake I had until now but nice anyway. Just too sweet, too girly.","Reutlingen, GERMANY","McTapps"
