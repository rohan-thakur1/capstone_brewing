1855,"2014-06-05",3.3,"Poured into a pint glass out of a 22oz bomber.

Pours a clear medium gold with a thin half finger white head. Really good head but lacing is nearly nonexistent. 

Aroma has fairly heavy notes of caramel and toast along with a fairly assertive grassy hop note. A whiff of alcohol comes through underneath.

The flavor is lighter on the caramel leaning more towards biscuit with hints of toast and cracker. Very slightly metallic but it is not distracting. Hops figure somewhat heavy in this brew but they are very subtle. Moderate to high bitterness throughout with some background grass and hay. It helps to balance out the comparatively high maltiness. This brew isnt overly sweet, however, and has just a little stickiness on the finish.

Overall, for a style I am not particularly fond of I enjoy this beer. It is not too sweet and the alcohol is well hidden. Nice job by Foothills.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

Came out a deep hazy goldish orange with about an inchs worth of white head on top. Retention was weak, but left some nice pretty lacing. Smells of grains, honey, and booze. 

Mouthfeel was crisp and bubbly, but not overly so. Classic Foothills. This beer is hot! Huge alcohol presence that masks most all flavors. Im getting some faint grainy biscuits, and a slight bitter finish, but this is all booze. The 8% is not hidden well. Theres a drying sweetness that coats the mouth at the end as well.

In the past Ive found it enjoyable, competent, and verging on overly sweet. But this time around, while the sweet bready malts are certainly there, it tastes like Foothills have hopped it much more aggressively to yield a more balanced beer.

Flavor is semi-sweet, with grassy hop and lots of carbonation. The end was dry and light. There was still a funkiness to it that remained non-offensive. Cant put my finger on it. This is much better off tap, which cant necessarily be said for their Sexual Chocolate; which can be drank out of a growler for a couple of weeks and maybe more while still retaining its amazing qualities. The 8% on this Maibock is masked very well, but its still a bock, from a young brewery and perhaps needs some tweeking? Very refreshing, nonetheless, for these warm summer days.
