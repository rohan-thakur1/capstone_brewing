2176,"2011-05-19",1.7,"Draught at Urhos. Dark mahogany body, light brown head. Big head for a sahti. Aroma of alcohol and those yellow pencils from Staedler. Flavour was more alcohol and pencil. Horrible.","Helsinki, FINLAND","Brandman"
2176,"2011-05-13",2.2,"Draught at St Urhos, Helsinki, Finland.
Dark reddish brown almost black colour with average sized light tan head. Nice appearance but not for traditional Sahti. Aroma is heavily pencil (lead), dark alcohol and malt. Flavour is dark malt and alcohol. Almost booze like flavour. Too much alcohol flavour is this one. Cant catch the real Sahti here. Maybe Im just too purist.","Tampere, FINLAND","rosenbergh"
2176,"2011-05-12",3.3,"On tap at Urhos Pub, Helsinki. Poured brown in colour with very thin tan head. Juniper and some forrest notes in aroma. Slightly burnt and light hints of liqourice in flavour. Quite strong juniper flavour in aftertaste. Leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Has to be one of the haziest beers Ive ever tried.","FINLAND","RexTalionis"

2176,"2009-05-18",3.3,"Draught 0.4L glass tasted at HBF 2009. Sweet bananas in the nose. Pale creamy head. Hazy dark brownish colour. Sweet taste full with banana. Fruity taste. Dessert.","Helsinki, FINLAND","JK54B"
2176,"2008-06-03",1.8,"500 ml bottle. Muddy brown color, no head. Junipery flavor with some fruity notes and a noticable cellar flavor. Im biased, but I really cant appreciate sahti at all -- this beer is definitely not my kind of drink.","Helsinki, FINLAND","tlind2"
2176,"2008-05-26",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 27, 2008 It takes time to get used to taste of Sahti.   Huvila Sahti is a good one to start. It´s easy to drink because of its sweet aroma, fruity taste and balanced amount of juniper. Sahti needs to be in top condition and served cold before you can taste the best parts of it.","Savonlinna, FINLAND","lada66"
2176,"2007-09-13",4.1,"Draught at Helsinki Beer Festival 2007. Slightly hazy dark brown color. Sweet and malty aroma with some banana, spicy rye and hints of juniper. Sweet flavor with firm rye note and warming finish. Smooth and oily palate with a thick milkshake like body. Few years ago this sahti tasted very different, but now it was in top condition and one of the best I have tasted. Suprisingly clean with no rustic notes often present in sahti.","Jyväskylä, FINLAND","Miksu"
2176,"2007-05-24",4.2,"No head, dark muddy color. Yeasty, soft aroma. Lots of bananas. Very traditional and earthy. Wonderfully smooth palate. Balanced, yeasty flavor. Dangerously drinkable. One of the best Sahtis in Finland.","Helsinki, FINLAND","mrdasilva"
2176,"2007-05-17",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2009 Draught (St. Urhos, Helsinki, Sahti Days 2007).
Very dark murky sahti. Traditional banana-sahti aroma, but as it warms also some coffee notes. Very rich taste, dark roasted malts, again some coffee. Slightly fizzy CO2 freshness. Quite bitter. Finish is hugely malty and bitter (but not a usual bitter hops bitterness, hard to identify).
Rerate: St Urhos 2009 sahti days, less impressive, some vegetal nature, and a touch sour, but very thick.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

2176,"2005-02-02",2.1,"Brown, cloudy color. Sweet, tangy, very weird aroma indeed. Flavor is also very strange: tangy, overly sweet, tastes like glue (havent really tasted). I assume that this batch was not ready yet.","Tampere, FINLAND","Jukkabro"

Dark nut brown, no head. Strong sweet berry, sugar and alcohol aroma, harsh. Sweet, sugary, hints of banana and juniper - low carbonation. Sticky aftertaste with molasses. Delicious - almost like Finnish low-alcohol table beer or Russian kvass. Like a good sahti, this hides ABV compeletely.","Pori, FINLAND","TBone"

Mild, asparagus-vegetably aroma. Flavor also has asparagus, some juniper, and light alcohol burn. Medium to full body with very low carbonation. Not very clean, not very complex. Hides the ABV quite well, but thats about all.
(Draught, 2007, was 6-3-6-4-13=3.2) Murky medium-brown with almost no head. Very perfumy aroma with hints of fresh asparagus and alcohol. Quite strange, semi-dry, vegetably flavor with grainy alcohol traces. Medium-bodied with flat carbonation. A strange and unclean sahti.
(Tapped) Very hazy, dark brown/amber color with no head. Quite mild, but very distinctive asparagus aroma. Flavor is also full of vegetables with asparagus still evident, with only slight banana fruitiness. Medium-bodied, quite pleasant palate. The one and only asparagus beer Ive tasted :)","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"
2176,"2003-04-01",4.0,"Sampled draught at Helsinki Beer Festival.
Muddy orange-brown apearance. Vague banana aroma, perhaps with a hint of glue. Bready and sweet, heavy on rye. Estery bubblegum flavour. Wonderfully full mouthfeel. Dangerously smooth and drinkable like apple juice, still it's 10.4%... Sweet finish without any trace of bitterness. A complex sahti, lower on banana flavour than usual for the style, supposedly because itis fermented at a relatively low temperature.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
