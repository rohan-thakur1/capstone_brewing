2419,"2015-03-01",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 4, 2015 Bottle (375 ml). 2010 harvest. Shared by Heather and Adam, thanks!

Appearance: Clear golden/pale amber leaving little legs on the glass.

Aroma: Cohesive bouquet of apple juice, berries, floral notes, mild alcohol, light sweetness and green grapes.

Taste: Good balance between apples, mild tartness, floral/honey sweetness, berries notes and a light alcohol touch. Its not an ""in your face"" apple taste, its all in subtlety. 

Palate: Medium body. Mouthfeel isnt too sticky even if theres definitely some sweetness in there. Moderately warming finish. 

Overall: A simple (as not super complex) yet tasty and well balanced Ice Cider. Easier to drink than most Québec Ice Ciders because of what I perceived as a lower level of residual sugars than most La Face Cachée de la Pomme products. Good one!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

2419,"2011-04-08",4.1,"Courtesy of yesprHazy deep blond color. Nice aroma of apples and citrusy acidity; fruity and fresh, wonderful. The body is agile, although a good amount of sugars are left; the citrusy acidity is prominent, followed by the flavor of apple juice (no stewed apples); balanced aggressiveness. Lovely.Tasted side to side, fresher and more dynamic than the Northern Spy; easier to drink.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

2419,"2010-09-15",3.8,"500mL 2009 Bottle. Tangy condensed aroma, with some zip, complexity, and  cooked apples. Pours in a brilliant, leggy, brassy golden. Flavor is very lively but is dominated by applesauce, apple butter, and candied apple slices. It has a very sugared and refined glow to it. This is delicious and very tasty, but I hate to say that with the applesauce flavor this comes across as slightly ""cooked"" so to speak. Otherwise, flavorful, rich, and fun. A dense treat that lingers with pith and skin in the long afterglow.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
