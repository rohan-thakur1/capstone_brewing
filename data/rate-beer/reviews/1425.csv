1425,"2014-08-07",4.5,"500mL bottle from State Line, love to see those recycling rings. Nose is very sweet, thick malt with brown sugar and various Maillard, earth, sticky grapes, light spice, faint roast and just beautiful aromatic complexity. Pours dark brown with a dense and sudsy tan head, lots of lace; really dialing everything in so far. Taste is very sweet with medium bitterness, light grain and a touch of chalk rising above other minerals, otherwise more of the aforementioned deep malt complexity and some low-lying fruitiness -- toffee, faint prune, anise. The bitterness turns somewhat astringent in the aftertaste but its not bad, and the hops really come forward with earth, wood, and spice to unleash a massive bite not anticipated by the nose alone. A gritty, lightly dank hop bite, herbal around the edges. Slow-arriving but strong warmth and a little bit of fumy fire from the alcohol. Full body. The presumed decoction might have been boiled a little too long, as the malt starts to resemble broth/bouillon after a while, but otherwise Id say this is about as perfect a Doppelsticke as youll be able to find, and a rival to the best Doppelböcke.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

1425,"2013-07-08",3.7,"A small, but lasting and dense off-white foam settles above the highly sedimented burnt caramel coloured robe. Concentrated malt flavours. Initially, it feels a bit candy-like, but you quickly realize that the sugariness is more that of a spread over a slice of richly cerealic bread than sheer candiness. Bright nutty overtones all throughout and pleasant smoky undertones contribute complexity to this German sipper. More smoke and breadiness come through as it warms up - yet there is little to no fruitiness, the beer being all about full maltiness. Very fullsome palate, silky on the tongue, with humble bubbles leaving the foreground to the generous malts. There are actually a fair bit of noble hops in here, providing a leafy background that is most welcome, managing to cut through the sweetness that could easily have been overwhelming. In the end, its not something I would like to drink very frequently, but its texture is remarkable and the malt extraction an undeniable exercise in the style.

Head is initially large, frothy, light brown, fully lasting.

A very assertive brew in both the malt and hop departments...it starts lusciously rich and sweet in the mouth, but the finish is quite aggressively bitter...a little too much so, which is its only weakness.

Quite a muddy murky dark brown, cant really get any light through it. Absurd thick bready tan head. Very interesting aroma. Starts almost nettle-sharp and hoppy, reminiscent of some of the better danish hoppy beers, but then mellows nicely. Quite full palate, pleasant carbonation makes it almost refreshing. Retronasals are a touch soapy and bitter, and with some dry earthy barkiness. Hints of the nettles come back too. On swallowing, the soap comes back stronger, this time perfumed. The finish is very dry and quite dirty, but very nicely bitter, with a pleasant little tingle. Some slightly ashy dry burntness right at the end perhaps. It may be 7.5%, but its very subtle about it, theres no indication that this is a strong beerm only that it is a hefty beer. No flaws or harshness apart from the fact that Im not a huge fan of perfumed soap, but you kind of lose that detail amongst the general fullness of the taste. Nice to see a German brewer go ""big"" in this direction, rather than just cranking up the malt sugars in an N-pelbock.

How: Bottle 375ml, Consumed probably fresh a few weeks after purchase directly from the source
The look: Cloudy mahogany-burgundy body topped by a large beige head with good retention
In long: Nose is bursting with herbal and grassy hops.  Taste has a nice nutty malt backbone (like roasted cashews and almonds) and a bit of caramel.  Then the assertive hops bite the tongue with a sharp herbal bitterness of medium-high intensity.  Certainly not what I expect from an Altbier (current ratebeer classification) because of its aggressive hopping and spiciness but Im not sure what I would call it Some kind of bastard nutty IPA.  I really enjoyed this beer.  I was very worried when I opened this Hoppeditz because days before I was disgusted by their awful Caulfield and Caulfield Not Just Plain Vanilla.

Rose-like flowers grace this Doppel(?) Sticke Alts lean caramel malts before delving into brash earthy, green bitterness. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A veil of foam covers the turbid reddish brown. 
-This is very hoppy for a German brew, but definitely not refined enough to make these shine brightly. 
-The frothy carbonation and lean body make this quite drinkable for its size. 
-The prevalent earthiness gets in the way.
-That flowery aroma is quite memorable.

1425,"2011-03-19",4.5,"375 ml bottle with intriguing artwork on the label and freshness date March 2013, into tulip. Pours clear, coppery-brown body with slight haze to it, topped by creamy, mid-sized stable off white head that fades to a firm cloth and gets revived with each swirl. Complex and rich aroma of malt with caramel, toasty and melanoidin-like qualities, peppery, earthy hops with slight citrusy notes and esters of dark fruits such as plum that managed to survive the lagering period.
The assertive bitterness of hops - that provide moderate peppery spiciness with a touch of citrus rind - is counterbalanced by malts attenuated enough to pave the way to a dry, everlasting bitter finish with nutty notes and slight astringency. Body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. This is a dark, reach and strong Altibier, undoubtly a Sticke. Yes, I will stick to it.

In short: a rich and complex, bitter yet sweet, spicy Altbier on pair with the best of its kind. Its a pity that reviewers on this site dont rate to style because this beer deserves a lot more than just currently weighted average of 3.25.","SLOVENIA","EvilBuddha"
