29,"2016-06-18",4.1,"Draft @ Himmeriget a little while back. Wanted to review after trying the normal WB Gose. This is a step-up from an already good beer. There is lots of yuzu that brigs out the citrus taste as well. So the acidic balance, saltiness, and thirst-quenching aspects are there, but it tastes that much better. Yuzu seems to be a great tool for sour or funky beers. Great stuff, probably my favorite Gose so far.","Vesterbro, DENMARK","copestx"

29,"2016-01-18",3.2,"Merci à Roger pour le partage! Une Gose pour moi très différente de celles que jai goûté jusquà présent. Je suis dabord surpris par ce nez qui me rappelle une confiture de fraises Double Fruits qui emboîte le pas à un vinaigre de vin rouge. Comme si ces arômes nétaient pas suffisamment contradictoires, je note également beaucoup de bois pourri servant depuis longtemps de support à des champignons. Où suis-je sil-vous-plaît? Bon, je goûte. Malts jeunes en bouche et Yuzu citronné. Une acidité importante du fruit se manifeste en attaque avec une profondeur intéressante qui ressemble à la contribution dun noyau de fruit rouge tel la cerise. Le sel dans la bière est cohérent au style. Jusque là tout se passe correctement. cest la finale qui pour moi est difficile à supporter. Une fois les fruits tombés, lacidité demeure et cest le champignon et le bois putride qui reprennent le dessus dans une longue finale râpeuse qui je dois le dire, me suggère un insupportable goût de vomi (la gorgée sûre qui remonte parfois lors de la digestion).

The addition of yuzu makes this an interesting variation of their gose, but not necessarily for the better in my humble opinion. The fruit certainly blends in nicely and adds some balance, but it takes away from the delicious, subtle complexity of the grains, salt and yeast.

Taste is the same, but less clean and with a salty background. Theres a wheat-malty spine on which everything else is attached, including the tart sourness. Its fizzy and sparkling in your mouth, but thin, like sparkling water. Overall very enjoyable, imagine it would be perfect on a warm summer day. Nice!","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Enegaard"
29,"2013-12-29",3.9,"BOD 10/23/13. Hazy golden pour with very little head and lacing. The nose is slightly sour citrus against a slight mineral background. Light medium body, low carbonation level but an almost slick mouthfeel. Quite an interesting taste that is a nice balance of sour, citrus and salt. Yuzu juice yields a nice tartness that carries beyond the smooth finish. Another very well crafted ale from Westbrook and a new take on an old style.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

29,"2013-12-04",3.9,"poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter.

Appearance: cloudy, golden yellow. A thin head leaves a good bit of lacing

Smell: lemon, yuzu(?), other citrus, and a touch of malt.

Taste: wow! hints the front of the tongue with a momentary sweet and fruity flavor, but this is quickly followed by strong sour flavor. Lemony and sour but not like the puckering sourness of an actual lemon. 

Mouthfeel: medium-light body; nicely carbonated; dry finish. 

Overall: Better than their regular Gose. Loads of well-crafted flavor in a low ABV brew.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"

29,"2013-11-25",4.0,"Bottle at Tony/Jim BA Birthday Extravaganza 2013 (Western Springs, IL). Pours a well hazed straw yellow hue. Glowing body with a brighter creamy white head atop. Mellow layer stays as a thicker ring, ok lacing. Aromas are salty and tart, lemon meets bready malts, gentle salt and straw. Some cobwebs, sodium element hits well. Tart citrus, gentle bread and grass. Initial is firmly sour up front, lemony and yuzu elements make this a bit puckering. Middle quickly shows lactic life, yogurt and straw meet salt, flaked wheat and gentle dough. Cleaner light body is quite drinkable, sourness really quite nice. Backend is tart, a touch salty but really that lactic and citrus fruit vibe really pprovide some synergy. Sour and quite crushable. Finish is tart, a bit slick and yogurty, citric acidity. Nice stuff. Really good flavors.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

29,"2013-11-12",4.0,"Sample at the Beers from the Bikes Villes tasting on 11/08/2013. Murky yellow-orange pour with a medium off-white head that diminishes gradually to a wispy film. Small patches of lacing on the glass. Aroma of tropical fruits and bready malt. Light-bodied with flavors of citrus, melons and toasted malt. Not sure what Yuzu juice is but I assume this is what it tastes like. The finish is semi-sweet with a tropical fruit aftertaste. Pretty good all around.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
29,"2013-11-11",4.2,"Pours a beautiful murky peach color with a small fizzy white head. A lot of what I assume is yuzu fruit (never seen it before) on the nose, reminiscent of lemonade, the saltiness is subdued a bit from the regular gose, and a nice wheat note. Wow, the taste blows me away. Still plenty of what I assume is yuzu fruit which adds wonderfully to the very lemon heavy flavors of the Gose, nice tart and salty notes, sourness is almost cut in half from what I remember of the Gose, nice lemony wheat flavor, and a really nice orange flavor as well. Im not too familiar with Yuzu, but this is really delicious. Didnt think there was much you could do to improve the regular Gose, but this does it pretty firmly. I very much hope to see this again.","South Carolina, USA","tdmuel"

Awesome burst of fresh citrus in the aroma, like sweet oranges and tangerines, the yuzu I guess. Tart flavor, not too sour, and another burst of tasty orange and citrus in the flavor. Man, I could pound these. Good stuff!","Georgia, USA","drowland"
29,"2013-11-03",4.0,"Big fresh squeezed citrus juice aroma with some tart notes. Light, lively mouthfeel with tart citrus followed by salty, and tart notes of the gose.
