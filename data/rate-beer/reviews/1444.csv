1444,"2016-11-30",3.7,"Bottle. Intense stuff., Peat, asphalt, fresh hazelnut, some walnut, leather, lots of dried fruit (raisins mostly), teas, dried plums. Multi-facetted beer. It gets woody only in the flavour, albeit with a vengeance. Lots and lots of wood. Not too heavy actually, the drinkability remains on an altbier level, even if the beer tastes actually more like a scotch ale.","Mikołów, POLAND","ElDesmadre"
1444,"2016-10-24",2.3,"Pours a bright hazelnut color with lighter brown hints, when held against the light, while producing a bubbly beige head, collapsing to a thin sheet of lacing.

Smells of tortured, torched malts with a profound earthiness to it, overshadowed by peat, fresh concrete and oil, thats how omnipresent the peat presents itself. The nose is still able to produce the beers typical rustic malt sweetness, this time though its just one of many aromas instead of defining them.

Has a medium carbonation with a thinner finish, ending soft and clean.

Tastes of cement, guache color, overripe plum pulp and sharp black peppers. Softer, malty, during the mid palate with just a sugary hint, tobacco ash and cold coals. Finishes aqueous soft with a very late, clean peat profile I was expecting in the first place - lots of wet and dried earth, herbal spices and a pleasant warmt. 

Even after a couple of years in the cellar this is defined by the barrel, resulting into a strange beer. The barrel is not well integrated, since this tastes like straight up Scotch, colliding with the inferior Alt foundation for the most part.","GERMANY","aleigator"
1444,"2016-09-18",3.3,"330ml bottle. Cloudy, mahogany colour with small to average, thick, creamy, fairly lasting, moderately lacing, off-white head. Peaty Whisky aroma, hints of leather, oak, widely disguised caramel malty background. Taste is toasty and caramel malty with some residual sweetness, predominating BA-notes of peat, leather, oak, tar. Unbalanced: The Whisky notes are too dominant and already not fully matching. Not without charm nevertheless.","Bielefeld, GERMANY","Idiosynkrasie"

Sweetish-malty, very smoky and a bit fruity taste of caramel, molasses, raisins, peat, iodine, some burnt rubber and a bit of vanilla, followed by a medium long, just slightly bitter, rather peaty finish. Medium to full body, slightly oily mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Good beer, quite intense but just not unbalanced, very satisfying.

Lovely Alt Hallertau bitters do not survive the onslaught of gung-ho Islay barreling. Beer remains drinkable and smoth enough without fuming alcohols - only I feel Alt is perfect as it is and does not need smoothing out.
