3553,"2017-05-16",4.2,"Tap @ Mikkeller Beer Celebration 2017  
Double Passionfruit Gose. 
Å»Ã³Å‚ty, caÅ‚kowicie mÄ™tny trunek. GÄ™sty jak krem, lub nektar marchwiowo-brzoskwiniowy.
WspaniaÅ‚a biaÅ‚a piana.
MARAKUJA NA MAKSA! Genialne! Rewelacyjnie pachnie, wyglÄ…da, a jeszcze lepiej smakuje.
PoczÄ…tkowo kwaskowate od marakui, po kilku Å‚ykach i ogrzaniu w dÅ‚oniach staje siÄ™ bardziej sÅ‚odkie. Na ostatniej prostej moÅ¼na wyczuÄ‡ dosÅ‚ownie szczyptÄ™ soli. SoczystoÅ›Ä‡ na najwyÅ¼szym poziomie.
GÅ‚adkie, super pijalne, sesyjne.
MÃ³gÅ‚bym takich kilka pod rzÄ…d wypiÄ‡.
Jedno z najlepszych jasnych Ale na festiwalu.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"
