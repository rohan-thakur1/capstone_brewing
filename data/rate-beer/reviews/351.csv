351,"2017-06-14",4.1,"(750ml bottle @ Koelschip, Copenhagen, May 11/17) Pours a clear pale copper colour with a small bubbly white head that leaves a ring. Notes of hefty, slightly wood, fortified wine, white grapes, soft pit fruit, a bit oxidized, tannic like weak iced tea, some malt, lightly funky, attic, a bit of lemony zippiness still. Lots of wood and wine barrel into the finish, slightly tart aftertaste. Medium full and oily body with very restrained carbonation. Big barrel character here, a bit sombre in some ways, not a bright fresh gueuze. Quite complex and interesting.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"
