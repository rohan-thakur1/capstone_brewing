340,"2016-10-17",4.4,"Pours a hazy orange-amber color with a fluffy big head, which receeds to a thick, stable lacing, coating the beer easily the entire time. There is even a thick head on the rest of the beer remaining in the bottle.

Smells of a prominent funkiness, old mushrooms and lots of ripe blue cheese, with a pleasant mix of minerals and lime zest to balance the barnyard qualities. Lime and apple rind grow even more apparent, once the beer reaches room temperature making the fruitiness an ingedient just as prominent as the funk. 

Has a very soft, yet vivid mouthfeel with an awesome flavor development, starting crisp and light with a creamy, funky ending. Very well pronounced as for its sourness while leaving enough room on the palate for the fruit and effervescence to cut through, creating a pleasant complexity.


Tastes of stony minerals, a soft aqueous note, old bread crust, wet straw and a prominent funkiness. The funk consists of dried grass, creamy blue cheese and wet mushrooms, together with a note of flowers to sooth the funk profile. Has a bright, lemony and slightly effervescent mid palate, which results in a mushroomy dustiness and more creamy cheese.

An awesome beer, producing a mind blowing depth of funk, gently balanced by the fruity crispness. Does not have too many more layers to it other than that, but thos truly convince by their pungent ripeness. Maintains it light and refreshing mouthfeel though, ending clean and soft.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Heart and thoughts going out to them on this sad day... Aroma: green apples, lemon, citrus, hay, a tad dusty. App: cloudy golden with medium white head and good retention and great lacing. Taste and palate: light body, light sweetness, moderate carbonation, light sweetness and lingering dry light bitter finish. Overall: good stuff. I find it way better than the white label. Also compared to other gueuze I find it way less dusty or barnyard. Different... And I like it. I think for someone starting drinking lambics, this one is a good starter since it?s easy to drink since it?s well balanced between the sweetness and the acidity. Nothing really stands out.

Refined and clean with strong balance, solid complexity, and medium intensity... Fleshy tropical fruit is wrapped in wood and mild funk stank with light acid and sourness (maybe a touch of skunkiness from the green bottle) leading to a creamy, almost marshmallow like note which works with the fruit components to conjure bubble gum... Underlying nuances of almond, flowers, honeydew, watermelon, strawberries, and hay rolling into orange and grapefruit on a nicely cohesive, smooth, medium body with restrained carbonation lending a smooth creamy coating offering light residuals of the previously mentioned components combining to offer a sense of white wine with mild acidity and dryness... Finishes a bit on the sweet side with a medium plus feel... Highly approachable

Kobberfarvet og ufiltreret Geueze med mindre hvid 1 cm tyk skumkrone, som svinder langsomt. 
Aromaen er ikke kæmpe tydelig, men der er noter af grapefrugt, appelsinskal, citrus, stald og Brettanomyces gær.

Opsummering: middel til kraftig sur, let bitter og zero sødme. 
I munden er der øl med medium fyldig krop og en del kuldioxid, som kun får det bedre at stå lidt og bruse af. Konsistensen er oily til cremet.

Taste has all the barnyard one would expect from a traditional lambic beer, vinegar, yoghurt and lemon, sour fruits, all in perfect balance, long and very complex finish, woody and funky in a totally elegant way with a perfectly dosed champagne-like carbonation. Its elegance and balance make it the best of the regularly produced geuzes, at least to my opinion. Masterpiece and a great advertisement for the utter complexity of the products of lambic land.  Geuze does not get much better than this - a false contrast, perhaps, with the artisanal, modest, almost shy way this brewery operates.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

340,"2014-06-06",4.4,"And now for my 3,000th rating. 
This is a beer I first tried about two years ago at Kronieksken in Liedekercke, previous to that Edmund Edmunds, aka Lushawn, aka GuardOfTheCellar, aka Loineshawn, aka KysHub69, aka Drake, aka SrSilligoose, aka Possum Aloisious Jenkins, aka a generous soul from the good old days gifted me this much sought after cx 2010 vintage of the beer out of the goodness of his heart. Fedex promptly put a big ol hole in the box, but it eventually got to me. I could think of no better beer to celebrate my 3,000th rating than this one, that I already love from a bottle gifted to me by one of the chillest bros this community has to offer. 



Pours a deep golden with a big champagne like rise and fall head & millions of tiny bubbles keeping a thin layer of foam continually forming atop the beer. 

The aroma is lemony & wooody with some pleasant almost cork like notes. Its funky in a sort of mild way but it does have a good lot of sour fruit going on in the aroma. Some white grape, some barnyard, some sea breeze.... Pungent & inviting. 

The flavor is bracingly dry, rustic & earthy. There is a very defined citrus peel in this one sourness, bitterness & all. The lemony character is very bright but the general sourness of the beer is Id say at a moderate level for the style, and really very moderate for this particular beer. This is just outright fantastic. 

The mouthfeel is prickly as champagne & sharp up front with a long finish.

340,"2013-11-22",4.2,"Bottle: slightly hazy, golden color with orange-ish hues thrown about; beaming white head that fizzles out quickly & loud like Alka-Seltzer. Aroma is funk-city. One of the funkiest gueuze out there, joining the ranks of Drie Fonteinen & Cantillon. Sweaty feet, dirty old horseblanket, musty & damp bales of hay. Ripping ripe & sour apple skins, lemon flesh, & mild white grape notes. Oak finish joins the funk & the tart nicely. Taste is very tart up front; under-ripe green apple & old lemon peels, mild acidity with notable lacto yeast. Sourness mellows mid-way into critter town with tannic oak, barnyard must, sweaty & cheesy funk. Finish of stone fruit-y acidity, mild hay, & drying oak. Ripping dry finish. Underrated gueuze, IMO... Great stuff.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

Very assertive on citric zest bitterness in the aroma combined with a rare, almost counteractive aged-hop bitter lemon spice make this geuze unique and delicious to me; dry palate, yet with a higher cultured malt residu than the standard puckerers.

340,"2013-03-30",3.3,"My first experience with the only remaining lambic maker whose product I havent tried. 375 mL bottle consumed by myself. Poured into a Teku stemmed glass. I believe this is a 2012 vintage, but dont see a date on the bottle or cork. 

Filling just beyond the bend in my glass creates a tall, frothy, beautiful head. This Gueuze is darker than most, with a glowing, misty orange hue. The appearance is superb, but it is unfortunately the most appreciable characteristic. 

Black Labels aroma is muted, suppressed. Most prominently I note cheesy old hops, lemony acidity, mowed grass, and green apple. Unlike a similar 3F geuze, this brews smell is far more subtle rather than in your face. The subtlety seems to be a lack of complexity more than the touch of refinement. 

Taste is downright watery. The first pass yields more mineral water than anything, and this is followed by Granny Smith apple, navel orange, slight lemon, ruby red grapefruit, and a dry, vinous finish. Oddly, there is a notable, though not overpowering, hop bitterness. With each sip I expect and wait for a rush of flavors that never appear. Im disappointed by the lack of flavor prominence. 

Mouthfeel is on par with most good lambic. Highly effervescent, dry, zippy, tingly, and tannic. 

Overall, I am wondering if I have a bad bottle. Others have rated this much more highly, and Im not that impressed. I would rather buy Tilquin 10 out of 10 times.","Texas, USA","bootsjohn"

340,"2013-01-01",4.4,"2012 bottle thats been sitting around for a few months. Cork comes out readily. The aroma of this beer is an experience on its own - apple, hay, lemon rind, and a pronounced herbal funk (including some lightstruck character). Deep gold in color with a slight haze. This particular bottle was unusual because it raised a substantial head of foam that lasted. Taste follows the aroma with a nicely balanced acidity. Apple peel, lemon rind, grain, hay, and an intriguing funk. A fantastic balance of each individual character. Prickly carbonation. Mouthfeel is appropriately dry and champagne-like.

The beer is slightly hazy, appearing a light orange hue. The head is over an inch thick, and leaves a nice sheet of lacing on the glass. 

The aroma offers citrus, funk, oak, the usual suspects.

Really easy to drink, hard not to guzzle. Masterfully blended. Citrus flavors sneak in and out among ever-present oak and funk presence. Delicious.

Slight pucker, masked alcohol, easy to drink. Great feel.

Overall, a terrific beer well deserving of its high rating.

340,"2012-05-26",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 11, 2015 Multiple 375 ml & 750 ml over time. Both fresh and aged.

Appearance: Bright golden/orange with lot of small bubbles, a frothy off-white head that diminishes to leave a small fully lasting head and little lacing.

Aroma: Barnyard, green apples, light peppery notes, citric presence, brettanomyces, leather, hay and lemon... so much complexity, but yet so smooth and well balanced.

Taste: Moderate acidity for the style, but still plenty of barnyard as well as green apples (not in a bad way), grapefruits/grapefruit bitterness, brettanomyces, oak and citric notes.

Palate: Light to medium body, but never watery. Lively carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel, a tad oaky especially when fresh. Dry finish.   

Overall: My ""everyday"" gueuze. Not because its not complex, but only because its cheap, easy to find, not too hyped and damn delicious! The balance is nearly perfect. Its a great gueuze right of the gate, but it can age gracefully as well and doesnt become acetic. Very complex, but still super drinkable/quenching. A true masterpiece!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Only a very small amount of sediment left the bottle, so the beer wasnt too cloudy or misty, a dirty old gold is the best colour discription I can come up with. An off-white head sat uneasily on top, looking like it wanted to be somewhere else. Masses of bubbles travelled upwards to join the unhappy foaming head.

Rotten cooking apples and pickling vinegar with a sour-puss smell. A cows farmyard that hasnt been hosed down for three weeks, even though the cows have used it twice daily to deliver calves.

Vingarous to a fault, this is one sour beer. Uncooked cooking apples mixed with cow dung came to mind. Ive tried to embrace this style and have even enjoyed a couple over the years, but I really struggled with this one. I can truely see why this type of beer isnt drank in Belgium very often and the style is slowly dying.

I had to have olives, various cheeses and crackers to help me finish off this bottle. God knows what my arse will smell like tomorrow, my intestines were complaining after the second sip.

This reminded me of an old rough scrumpy style cider that a farmhand with a few loose marbles might try and drink to help his teeth rot and scramble his brain even more.

The funk comes through a little more on the taste but once again it is restrained compared to other examples of this style. Lemony lime citrus is much more prominent and there is some pear as well. I think I can even taste a little bit of caramel. Quite a bit of tartness is present leading to an incredibly crisp, dry finish.

Pour is bright, slightly hazy golden amber with some yeast chunks collecting around the bottom.  The white head is fizzy and short-lived with plenty of bubbles streaming to the top.

Aroma is wonderfully complex with all kinds of things going on.  There is the slightly tart green apple and pear sweetness but with a musty, wet hay thing going on in addition to some acetic acid.

Taste has an initial mouth-puckering tartness with lemons and green apples but also with a hefty bretty funk thrown in.  There is some dry oak in the finish and the tartness and acid linger on the palate for a long time.

The mouthfeel is crisp, clean and dry with lots of tingling tartness on the tongue.

Pours light copperish amber with a huge and tight bubbled white head. Just gorgeous. Aroma is more funky than I remeber other bottles - brettanomyces and wild yeast just all over the place. But it also has the most lovely and very signature Girardin gooseberry/grape fruit tarty fruitiness that trademarks this gueuze to me. Eventually strong lactic acidity along with a rural hay-ish farmhouse touch. Magnificent! The taste is of course tart and gueuzy as always - but the tartness is so elegant and well balanced - matched by nothing Ive had this far (well, I admit that I havent had many). Definitely on the more fruity side compared to Cantillon, 3F etc, but the funkiness suffices and creates a harmonious balance.

340,"2011-08-19",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 23, 2011 37,5 cl Bottle, July 2011,  Vintage from 1999.

This old beauty came from the dusty cellars of Akkurat and it was actually my first beer being over 10 years old. It pours lustrously golden clear with a tinge of orange. The nose is incredibly rich, a fountain of flavours and aromas, full of sugar and complex sour notes. Its so vividly alive and luscious! The aroma is filled with fruits, nuts, wood and of course a dash of barnyard, but not to much.

As I go into tasting it Im surprised how balanced and smooth it is. The levelling of sweet, sour and acidic flavours is simply amazing. At the same time it feels dusty and rustic which I expect from an older beer like this. Great taste with a nice fruitiness here as well. Apples and pears are dominant but just as in the aroma its a jumble of fruits and flavours. The finish is slightly dry and sits just perfect on my tongue. Its so drinkable and if you dont control yourself you quaff it to quick and wonder where the bottle went!

8 - 5 - 9 - 5 - 19


37,5 cl Bottle, August 2011,  Bottle from 2011.
Pours hazy orange. Nose is a bit sharp with a lot of vinegar notes. Under the layer of acidity fruity and flowery flavours is to be found mostly apples and apple tart. There is a nice sourness and barnyard feeling to it but its not anywhere near the vintage mentioned above. It also lacks the sweet aromas that ties everything together and balances it up.

The taste of it is nowhere as balanced as I expected it, still al right though. The barnyard feeling here is much more present and it lacks the sweetness I would have wanted. Dont get me wrong its still very good it just lacks the balance to make it perfect. Hopefully that will come in a few years. Its quite dry and the body medium to full. This is overall a good beer even unaged and seeing thats so cheap this is defiantly a beer you can afford to have home or age in a greater number. Great work.

340,"2011-08-11",3.4,"Lots of apple maps, elderberry and finish is like a white wine vinegar. Its not very balanced, but Ive heard this beer ages really good. Lets see how it is after 5 years.","SWEDEN","Clyx"
340,"2011-08-01",4.8,"DAY 1 NOTES:  Bouquet:  Sour, musty, lightly funky (in a fecal family resemblance kind of way) farmhouse, dusty straw, citrus.
Palate: Smoother than the Cantillon fruit lambics. Long finish.
Flavor:  Sour, bitter, moldy/musty, white grapefruit plus rind, plus orange with rind and possibly some dried peach or nectarine.

DAY 2 NOTES:  Bouquet:  Sour, dusty straw, elegant and pleasantly funky farmhouse (more integrated and not fecal), spicy and peppery mikan.  Flavor: Partially dried mikan, with understated sourness, white grapefruit and rind, pepper, dusty straw.  Finishes with a light, funky mold.

COMMENT:  Improved overnight (used champagne stopper).  Brilliant, complex, long finish and superbly balanced.  As the Rate Beer description says, this beats champagne in terms of complexity.  This is the highest rating I have ever given to a beer (or wine!).  As a blend of old and new lambic, the sourness is far less overt than a young lambic, making this smoother and easier to drink.  Still, this style is an acquired taste and might appeal more to those with adventurous palates.  Its taken me a few years to come around to liking this style of beer.","Kobe, JAPAN","Wombata"

I was a bit surprised by the taste.  Of course it is funky and sour but I get a distinct hay taste in there along with sour apple.

The grain can also be picked up.

The flavor is also very mild, but delicious. It has a very nice sourness to it but also a bit of malt balance. The flavor has some herbal notes but is primarily lemony and acidic with a hint of sugar.

It is an interesting one. I have an older vintage in the cellar which i will give a long age and then try this one again.

4.0 A: Lightly hazed peachy orange color. Two fingers of creamy off-white head. Much of the head fell quickly, but the remaining quarter inch was a bit more stubborn and leaves a quarter inch of lacing.

4.0 S: Decent amount of barnyard funk, cidery, and sour lemon. Hay, some apple fruitiness, slight acidity. Not powerful enough for my preferences, but amazingly no tannin astringency at all.

4.5 T: Taste is much better and lives up to expectations. Surprisingly sour considering the nose is rather tame. Plenty of lactic acid, acetic acid to a lower degree, barnyard funk, musty basement. Lemony sourness, apple cider, and hay. Some astringency in here, but very little and much lower than anything else Ive had of the style. Dry throughout.

4.0 M: Light to lighter medium body. Good active carbonation. Smooth for a sour due to the lack of astringency. Could be a bit creamier though.

5.0 D: Definitely a solid gueuze. This is definitely there to help you get a sour fix. Well balanced flavor profile, great taste, and everything else is pleasant. By the end of the bottle I wanted more.

340,"2010-11-15",4.4,"I am still baffled by Belgiums use of green bottles, but thats a tangent for another day. Orange amber and gold along the bottom, my glass glows a gentle haze of white and straw. Her little white head soon wanders to far-off pastures with only lace to remind me of her passing. Typically though, gueuze doesnt showcase voluptuous heads; their acidic nature tends to kill that off rather quickly which is quite alright. Her nose? Sour, earth, and funk. Tart peach and apricot skins with an underbelly of leather, wood, and funk. Joining the tart peach and apricot skins are unripe kiwi and green pineapple ready and raring to pucker the day away. Mwahahahahaha! One more long snuff of tangelo skins, pith, and saddlebags glistening with a fresh helping of orange oil and its off to supping gueuzevana I quaff. I love it when the sides of my cheeks shiver and tingle under the playful touch of tartness. Taking a moment to savor the aromaI then move onto flavor exploration. Kiwi, pineapple, and apricot skins are bright atop my tongue while leather with orange oil essence lurks underneath. Each quaffs pierces my tongue with flavor. After the apricot, kiwi, tangerine, and pineapple work their unripe tart skinly magic, leather, wood, and funk come in to soothe and satisfy. A slow gentle dryness is the only presence of pith while grass hits last for a brief tickle in the back of my throat. A few more quaffs and I surrender pen and paper to pure unbridled tasting indulgence.


Sour beers, whether lambics, gueuze, or something somewhere inbetween are amazingly complex and often delicate beers that have so much to offer once one opens their mind to the tart tingly pleasures within.

This is going to be exciting, as it is my first gueuze. I have heard that it is really a love or hate beer style, but lets see. Until now, there has only been one beer style I didnt appreciate, and that is Berliner Weisse. Well, the appearance of this gueuze isnt frightening me. Were talking dark yellow beer here, and a cloudy one. The head was airy at first, but seems to have settled in a more dense condition and about my little finger in thickness. I am not used to rate gueuzes as this is my first one, but I have to admit that I am not impressed by the aroma. Most of all it reminds me of a yeasty white wine, and has the exact same kind of sourness. Some mild grainy hops are present too. I am really lost about how to rate this taste. Still, it reminds me very much of white wine, but of course it keeps some beer elements. Most present are lemon with leather, woody and basement-like flavors, alltogether with the overshadowing sourishness. Mild hopped and sour finish. Sour and bitter aftertaste. Ok flavor all in all. Creamy and soft, but rather thin and VERY dry. Exciting beer, but not one I am wild about.   If this is how gueuzes are supposed to taste, as I believe it is when looking at the score, there will probably be a long time before I buy a gueuze again. Not because this is a bad beer, but because it reminds me too much of white wine. And the case is not that I dont like white wine, but if I wish to drink something that tastes like white wine, I will buy a white wine, and not a beer ""copy"" of the drink. Another thing is, that I appreciate the wonders of beer as complex American Strong Ales, creamy Belgian Abbey Ales and fantasticly evil Imperial Stouts much more than I can ever do wine or beer that tastes like wine.","Nysted, DENMARK","flemmingwillum"

T- Lots of lemon upfront as well as an acidic tartness comes through initially as well as a touch of vinegar. What lingers on the palate is some tartness, as well as a touch of vanilla and wood.

Brett bomb here with some citrus, mild carbonation, and just straight sour palate.  Sour and smooth because of the little carbonation.  Great brew.  My first rated gueuze! What a great lambik to start with!","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","SpencerDB"
340,"2010-01-07",4.1,"Golden orange with small amber hues. The liquid is actually quite clear. A surprisingly big head develops. The head is ivory-colored, shows good retention and leaves big lacings as it dissipates and finally settles into a nice lid of foam.

A nice smell with a good mixture of tart fruity aromas (mostly lemon) and ripe fermenting apples, with big additional notes of horse blanket and a general funkiness. Some puckering vinegar, white bread, spices and grassy notes as well.

A great taste with a strong acidity. The sourness really grabs hold of you as it makes the cheeks feel like theyre making out with a nine volt battery. Musty apples and a note of white bread in the mouth, coupled with yeast and earth. Heres not a lot of sweetness to balance the massive acidity. However, delightful, at least semi-sweet, flavors of lemon develops and get accentuated as well as turning really sour towards the finish. The funkiness is restrained, but some notes of horse blanket and barnyard is noticeable, and the funk actually gets more pronounced as the beer warms up. The finish is incredibly long with a forever lasting sourness that is right on the edge of becoming too assertive. Notes of lemon pits and minerals are the only things that manages to break through the fantastic acidity.

Medium body, effervescent character. The beer gets a slightly sharp edge due to the lively carbonation. The finish is not overly dry, but after a while the mouth gets really dry from this one.

A high quality gueuze. Complex and sophisticated, yet with plenty of that unique spontaneous edginess. Its delightfully sour (it could even give some of the beers from Cantillon a go regarding levels of acidity) but it never goes out of hand. I would also like to especially emphasize how great the finish in this one is, really magnificent.

340,"2010-01-05",4.3,"375ml Bottle.  Nice pop on the cork with CO2 vapors pouring out.  Fizzy pour that is reminiscent of champagne.  Golden straw color with a quickly dissipating head.  Nose is slightly tart, dry and earthy with a bit of bitter grapefruit.  Flavor is well balanced with some sweetness and a late blooming pervasive sourness.  Definitely has lots of Brett character that gives the typical barnyard funk of old blankets, stale straw and mildewed cheese.  Carbonation level is pretty high and helps the complex flavors burst on the tongue.  I love the way the sourness creeps up on you.  A definite winner that is surprisingly easy to drink.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"

340,"2010-01-03",4.1,"Very nice poor into a tulip glass. It was very golden with minimal head and was very balanced between sweet and sour. It is my favorite Lambic- Gueze to date. It smells very fruity and reminiscent of a cold cider. It was very easy and settling and a joy to drink. The beer is very sweet and has a very nice acidity level with a very refreshing finish. This beer style is slowly becoming my favorite due to the explosive taste and sour finishes. It is a very refreshing low ABV beer that is a must have when available.","Pottstown, Pennsylvania, USA","BernieLomax"

Very big citrusy lemon with a bit of sweetness lending itself to a lemonhead candy vibe. Something slightly vegetal at the very beginning. Medium bodied. Very smooth and well balanced.

Bright orange-gold color with a huge fluffy off-white head.  A ton of lacing left behind that scatters all over the glass.  This is tart, sour and a bit sharp which leaves a nice mild tingle on the senses.  Flavors are lots of funk, with peaches, cherries and grapefruit.  The sweetness of the beer is countered nicely by a dry numbing.  Insanely drinkable while still being intense.

Ive enjoyed other lambics Ive had, but this was terrible (maybe its just the gueze style I dont like). This poured a champagne color with little head and some carbonation. Unfortunately, both the nose and taste were a rancid mixture of very sour apples and vinegar. Early on, I kept thinking maybe the sour would be followed by a sweet sensation, a la Flemish Sours, but instead, it just kept getting more sour and acidic. Ended up cleaning the drain.","Dacula, Georgia, USA","kimcgolf"

Pours an almost layered dull gold that has some orange notes throughout, hazy and well carbonated, a big slightly offwhite head adorns the brew and dies down to a small layer, a little lacing. Aromas are pretty bretty, featuring horseblanket and barnyard funk above the citrusy sourness beneath. Vinegar, lemon and grapefruit, and some fairly acidic feel and sour peach. Initial is light, with good tart sourness up front, lemon and grapefruit with a touch sweeter side further in, moving into good bretty funk. Acid becomes a nice level, balancing well after a few sips, fruity citrus and peach move into light sweetness, fruits, with brett and funk complimenting well, juicy melange of fruit sticks out though and sticks in the finish and aftertaste with good acidity, sourness, tart, with light bitterness. Mouth coat is tart, but preaches a good sweet fruitiness as well. Really grows on me as faint rubber comes in towards the back end, light vinegar, faint cheesiness.

340,"2009-07-14",3.7,"From the Vegas trip stash... 1st Gueuze I think. Poured out a hazy light orangish beer with a big thick white cap that gets it done. Initially it blew me away but soon after I realized that as much as I appreciate the aroma, there just was not any appeal personally. An odd musty barnyard smell, sour lemon and pretty much outright rank which I guess is good in this case, cold tongue sandwich, cherries, slight sweetness. The taste was more of the same with more sourness, lemon, apple, grass, lots of yeast, mild but good spices, misc. wood and the expected stiff funk. Super tart and sour! The mouth feel is very tart and drying with a spicy, musty, tart finish. Very interesting. Will I rush out for more? No chance.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

All complexities in the flavor get drowned out by the acidity which is a shame because there is some definite complexity there on the first sip.

340,"2008-12-30",4.7,"This pours out with a slightly hazy orange body that practically glows in the glass.  A light white head forms and then fades to a mist resting on top, and at the sides of the glass, soapy bubbles remain.  The aroma is striking.  It is incredibly sour with layers of rotten apples, unripe pears, cheese rind, and pepper.  Nice tart flavor is puckering.  Lemons, oak, acidic, and a slight bitterness in the finish.  Perfect body with a lingering aftertaste.  Pretty much amazing.","Lexington Park, Maryland, USA","wickedpete"

This is one of the more acidic guezes I´ve had but it is nice and complex.  Acidity hits you right away with lemon, apple, some spices come in, malts come in later and it finishes quite dry.  The taste of this changes as my bottle has been open and my palate exposed more to it, but difficult to describe.  Not something I´d drink all the time, but quite nice every once in a while.",", Iowa, USA","Gar4016"

Immediately notice the tartness upon tasting but it mellows into a lightly acidic lemony wood flavor. Also notes of cork, aspirin, and a touch of wheat. Medium dryness for the style. Quite drinkable though maybe not quite as complex as I had hoped.","Mountville, Pennsylvania, USA","afireinside96"

A zestfulness, some rich wood and a light sweet flavor also. Complex and tasty. Not harsh, but full flavored.

Citrus fruits - lemon, lime and grapefruit - maybe some other tart fruits, with a spectacular balance of sweet and bitter. Some funk on the nose, but not in the flavor. This is wonderful stuff.

Smells of cheap rose-based perfume and unripe fruit.  Tastes of strawberries, apple, and faint peach -- none of which approach ripeness.  Hard for me to tell the difference between this and a sour beer.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","nbutler11"

Fantastic.","Austin, Texas, USA","slimchill"
340,"2008-09-10",4.1,"Pours hazy bronze with a 1 cm tall white head.  Pleasant aroma of bitter crabapples, yeast, and musk.  Wicked bitter bite.  Very sour and acidic, with a mostly apple flavor and some metal.  This bitterness continues throughout, but at the very end the beer takes a mellow, sweeter turn.  A buttery, biscuit-like flavor burns thorugh.  Sometimes it leans into a cheese flavor, like maybe an emmentaler.  Delicious sipper of a beer.","San Diego, California, USA","trokini"
340,"2008-09-09",4.9,"UPDATED: JUL 16, 2011 Hazy orange-gold with a short lived white head, moderate lacing. The nose is as cohesive as it comes. The only complaint is that its not incredibly strong, but put your nose to the glass: tart yet sweet fruits, like a braeburn apple, dry dusty frontier, urea, sweet belgian malt reminiscent of honey, cobwebs and old newspaper, cheese... they just go round and roundThe flavor is definitely sweeter than expected, even un-sour for a gueuze: tart, dry, leathery, and musty, yet also sweet and slightly malty. The palate is perfectly dry and refreshing, long-lasting in tart apple and sweet malt that cling perfectly. I drank this most recently in a stretch of about ten queuze and sours, this still won out rather easily. Refined and unique, Girardin Black is immediately noticeable in the same way that Westvleteren 12 and Struise Pannepot sail above their respective competitors.Ive had so many vintages, but recently tried the 99 again.

340,"2008-08-24",4.5,"Thanks to Dim for this one
Bottle poured into my tulip glass produced the required two fingers of white billowy head that lasted a while. The head then trailed of to a nice covering of lace. The body on this was a hazy orange 

The aromas from the glass were nice and funky. Sour apples come to mind as I whiff it again the acidity on this is very present in the nose do I dare taste it?

WOW Im glad I like sours this one is quite intense. I let my teens have a sip and they thought it was some sour head candy drink LOL. It reminds me of a crab apple or a transparent apple pie I am a sucker for a good sour apple pie. Some grapefruit citrus as well in here flavor wise. The mouthfeel is crisp and dry good carbonation very refreshing

I sat there for a couple of minutes just smelling.  I couldn’t bring myself to drink it immediately because it simply smelled wonderful.  I would sniff and smile.  My mouth was watering with the anticipation, but I just couldn’t help myself.  When I finally did  get around to drinking it, I was not disappointed at all.  It was definitely tart/sour, but not shockingly so.  The fruit flavor burst and tingled like fireworks, and left with puckering dry mouth.  I think I might be in trouble with this one, at $XX.XX bucks a bottle.","San Diego, California, USA","Lagunitasfan"

Questa è decisamente vinosa, non molto acida, piuttosto corposa, con una punta d’amarognolo inusitata che si stempera in un dolciastro che lascia proprio sentori decisi di botte.

340,"2008-05-13",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 29, 2008 I fail to understand the true appeal of the lambic. These beers are so incredibly expensive and  heavily aged--lets get some barley wines with 2 years of age on them by default. 
This one was very sweet and intensely, brutally, overwhelmingly acidic. Exactly like drinking Sprite with vinegar. Much grapiness in the flavors also, like sour cherry champagne that is foot-in-mouth bitter. I really like this beer however, and since Impy Stout and Barley Wine are the only styles I judge by style and not flavor, I will have to reluctantly rate this very high.","Maryland, USA","Skeegle"

Dark golden pour with a dense, rocky, tiny-bubbled, noise beige head and champagne-like clinging to the undersides of the glass.  Laces. with legs.

Slight dish-soapy champagne tone (the flavor, not a negative).  Medium body, smooth and malty other than the initial burst of sparkle.  Dry and water-sucking.  Mouth and throat are left dry and sated for some time after drinking.  Touch of lemon cleaner and floral notes with the bend of leather.   Complexity of the sour wood makes this a winner.

A moderate lactic acidity greets the palate up front, along with hints of lemon juice and a bright point reyes bleu funk.  Light white pepper spice and touches of aged oak.

It is dry and acidic and has an apple tartness, but it doesnt devolve into the vinegar flavor that I associate with sours.

340,"2007-12-21",3.9,"375 ml bottle from Holiday. Pours a cloudy, unfiltered orange color with a small white head that fades quickly leaving lacing in the glass. The aroma is medium-light in strength with citrus and musty grapes. The flavor is complex starting with a sour/tart sensation in the forefront featuring grapes, citrus and oak. Rounding out the side is lemon grass, and completing the palate there is a touch of yeasty biscuit. The mouthfeel is silky smooth with lively carbonation and an astringent quality that really works here. The finish is long with more musty grapes and the astringency giving way to grapefruit. Overall: My first traditional gueuze tasting and a quite memorable one. Recommended.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"
340,"2007-12-11",4.4,"A mid-sized frothy white trickles away slowly but only fades a bit. Webbed lacing leaves tracks all over the glass. A careful pour unleashes a great deep golden amber body with a slight haze. A steady stream of evenly dispersed visible carbonation aggresively piles upward. The nose is like no other sour beer on Earth, sour and funky with such inviting fruitiness that centers around apple and pear. If ever a standard for lovely barnyard funkiness, that any inexperienced drinker could grow accustomed to, were to be defined, this would have to be it. Straw, wet grass and leather envelope horseblanket notes that grow ripe and musty as warmth increases. Acetic traits are vibrant in the nose but mostly just lend to the allure of the entirety of the aroma. Yeast is provacative and hearty, infiltrating each whiff from start to finish. The flavor is highly acidic, mildly to moderately acetic, with a funk note that turns into raging mustiness halfway through. Horseblanket notes arrive again, sticking around for the duration. Sweetness is low to mild and intermittent. Lemon notes and lactic undercurrents add to the multi-dimensional intricacies of the flavor. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated, very silky and light-medium bodied, absurdly smooth and agreeable. The finish is funky, slowly drying with a touch of cedary woodiness and lingering salty fuink and must. A benchmark for a true but easygoing gueuze.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
340,"2007-12-11",3.9,"Pours the color of an authentic orange marmalade.  Aroma is classic funky lambicness, yes I made that word up.  Hay, earth, grapefruit candy, just what I like in this style.

Not much carbonation in the body. Flavor has a lemon-rind tartness upfront followed by some vinegar-like characteristics and some old dried woodiness. Later one it gives off a bone dryness, and a very late lactic funk at the back of the tongue. A solid, funky Lambic.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

I popped the cork and it took off like a rocket.  I was ready for it, but still nothing I could do.  I sucked some of the spillage up off the counter, and it stung the hell out of my chapped lips.  OUCH!
When I finally managed to get it in the glass, it produces mostly a huge whire head.  It eventually turned in to a yellow-orange beer with a lot of bubbles.
I suppose the aroma is pretty much the same for all gueuze.  Cob webs, dusty, oak barrel, horse blanket.  Not really sure what else to say about it.
Over the top tart.  Very much like orange juice concentrate.  Not a bad flavor, be very aggressive.

340,"2007-09-14",4.1,"Pours fizzy orange-amber with very little head.  Aroma of sour apple, lemon, champagne.  I havent experienced a lambic-gueuze before, and this is quite a experience.  Strong citrus and sourness give way to to an almost soy sauce/msg type flavor which I think is what everyone is referring to with the term ""barnyard funk"".  It is not, however, an unpleasant flavor, quite the contrary.  I really enjoy this and will definitely sample more of this style.","Quincy, Massachusetts, USA","lordeche"

After developing a love for the style, this one is finally getting a fair shot with me.  Pours a lightly hazy, dark golden-amber color with a small, frothy, white head.  Droopy, sudsy lace does its best to stick to the glass, to no avail.  The aroma shows sour apricots, lemons, New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, worn leather, and some funky, acidic, barnyard yeast.  The flavor is deliciously sour, with lemon and grapefruit each staking a major claim, followed by funky yeast and earthy leather and woody notes.  Medium bodied, well carbonated, and puckering, the mouthfeel is just as a lambic should be.  The finish is long, showing ample fruity funk and a drying dust.

Intense aroma, lots of wood, vinegar, sulphur, wet fur, hay, mustard.  Almost fishy at times.  Woodier than the Cantillon Organic/bio that I had, which is my other gueuze experience.  Taste initially shocks me with sourness, which I dont know if Ill ever be at the point where that taste doesnt shock me.  Theres also a strong dry woody flavor to this and some sweet bread dough malt flavor.  Finishes with that dry, almost toasted wood taste laying on the back of the tongue.  A very earthy rather than citrus sour flavor overall.  Finishes dry but cloying, perhaps a reflex to the sour flavor.  Medium bodied, highly carbonated mouthfeel, and a little slick.

The sourness in the flavor is appropriate with a light fruity sweetness underneath reminiscent of white grapes and apples with additional flavors similar to cedar, grass, goat cheese,  and more.

The flavor is tart, and, well, makes one think a bit of old stuff that has been around too long. Bits of orange and unfamilar spice.

340,"2007-08-03",4.1,"375 ml bottle
The past two gueuzes I have tried have not agreed with me at all so I opened this one cautiously.  I wasnt as worried about the cork as what it may do to my stomach.  It turns out this one was a bit more agreeable especially since I balanced it with plenty of water.  At $8.99 I am unlikely to pick this up often but perhaps it will be one that I pick up for special occasions or to introduce people to the style.
Aroma / Appearance - A half finger offwhite head graced the top of a carbonated active body.  It looked to be dark orange as much light trickled through.  As I expected the nose was very sour and tart.  Lemons, oranges and hay formed the relatively simple grouping but it was enough to make me want to give it a try.
Flavor / Palate - The tart dry sourness reminded me of the sugary substance that is left in an empty bag of sour patch kids.  It fades fast with a slightly harsh mouthfeel attacking the throat.  Oranges and hayseed are left behind.  As I worked my way through the bottle it began to take on a corky characteristic.  Other than that I found it almost perfect.  Next up perhaps I will tackle a Cantillon gueuze.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

This beer pours with a nice creamy off white head.  The aroma is great for the style.  Nice funky tart smell.  

The hand pulls the glass form the mouth as the first drops hit the tongue.  The acidity and tartness, while expected by the brain, still surprise the tongue.  But once the tongue gets used to the tartness, it processes the flavors that were predicted by the first smell.  Very complex, funky flavor.  And very good.

340,"2007-01-11",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2007 Heres a beer that, by all appearances, is from an antediluvian era.  That may be extreme, but its a beer with vintage qualities, from wrapping to palate.  It also possesses the unique quality of being one of my first geuzes, and one Ive been waiting sometime for.  I lost it somewhere in the move from home to college (and again in the reverse), and in the midst of a scrambled search for my socks I found it.  My imagination discovered that I actually knew nothing about geuzes, and was eager to fill in the details with random smatterings of misconceptions and outright lies, so that when it poured a clouded, monarch butterfly orange I was more taken aback than I normally would have been.  The head was bubbly with pockets of the occasional arch-bubble, dominating his own group of tiny and soon to be assimilated minions.  It reminded me of a well prepared and baked pizza crust with variable texture, but uniform in makeup and taste.  It even shared the same shade of tan as pizza crust.  A little patience and the head crumbles into a moat.  A few more degrees of the large clock hand and it erodes further into an open ended valley in a process that would leave geologists swooning.  From the many shifting tectonic and frivolously bubbly layers comes a well paced smell of apple, sparkling cider, Jamaican all spice, pumpkin, vanilla sugar and an encapsulating, piercing tartness.  Its like a thousand tiny rapier stabs, which if movies are any judge of reality, are not nearly as fatal but are a great deal more painful.  A swish around the mouth reveals another face of the beer with more prevalent and dominating fruits.  Apple and pear mix and mash to form a kind of delicious, low on sugar slurry to make a solid base for the other sharper fruits.  Cranberry gives a name to the rest with more bitterness and acerbity than sugar and a nice shock to the taste buds previously coddled by the baby food apple-pear mix.  The sourness makes a precise pinch at the roof of my mouth, but is suddenly stricken with lethargy and recedes.  In its absence white wine vinegar appears with a nice smidgeon of black pepper.  The aftertaste mellows things out with a mysterious, reclined and relaxed wheatiness.  Its slightly watery relative to the flavor impact, but this quality makes it refreshing and satisfying.  I expected more complexity such as cheeses or grasses, but found none.  This is how a sour beer should be made  with the drinker in mind.  Nice complementary flavors and a quenching satisfaction paired with sourness make for a well rounded and supplicating drinking experience.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Head is very full, fizzy, and white with little lasting ability.  Nose is sour with some funky barnyard, notes of hay, muskiness, honey, faint pear, and some overripe sour cherry.  Flavor is similar, still the overripe sour cherries with a soft tartness, other notes of barnyard, slight oak, lemon zest, slight wheat, and dusty yeast; bitterness is low, but keeping from being overly tart.  Palate is medium-light, moderate carbonation, and a mildly refreshing character.  Finishes tart with lemon and some dusty yeast.  Interesting and complex with a nice soft tartness.

340,"2006-10-25",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2007 So I have been waiting a while to try this and just on chance I walked into New beer in NYC and this was laying around.  Dont think a shipment came in to NY, probably just a misplaced case.  Also, lots of crude in the neck makes me think its been sitting around for a while.  So I split this into two glasses a Lindemans flute and a small tulip glass.  Cork pops with lots of power, barely had to force it off.  Pours with a vicious head in the flute and a small but strong head in the tulip.  Color is a very nice light amber orange, murky, cannot see through it yet full of bouncing light.  Visible carbonation but not too much.  Aroma is strong, a strong but aged tartiness, Ill compare it to the tartiness I get in a  lot of Cantillons but much more subdued.  I figure age has done this.  There is what I feel is a burnt rubber aroma akin to a 3 Fonteinen Gueze, which I am not a fan of but here it is a background character enhancing the aroma.  Also imagine smelling fruit, more particularly strawberries but without any of the sweetness.  I know its weird but its what I get.  Some hay and funk all around.  Taste is incredibly mellow and funky with a sharp tartiness kicking in just as you swallow and passing fast.  Leaving a leathery aftertaste that quickly subsides into dryness.  I really am impressed by the mellowness of this lambic.  A spiky carbonation to offset the tartiness.  But all of it passes and nothing is left but a dry feeling in your mouth begging for more.Another 375mL bottle, also marked 1106 on cork and much less crude in the neck.  So I really have no idea what the age on either of the bottles are.  Just wanted to return to this because its just such a great beer.  Aroma is orange marmalade infused vinegar. And it jut smells so fresh, nothing about it could give away the age. Taste is very sour and sweet-less fruits and ends with a long long good herbalness and sourness.  I no longer get any of the ""rubber"" I got in a bottle a year ago.  Just the best.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

Aroma featured an initial burst of pickled green olive juice, but settled down to hint at some wet straw and wet horse, maybe some malt vinegar. The flavor was more olive juice up front, lightly sweet - somewhat sweeter than many other gueuzes Ive tried, but it moved toward a drying finish. Acidic and very tart, some lemon juice flavors - but not the most sour and I found this slight, smooth and drinkable.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
340,"2006-07-24",4.4,"Thanks to EDA for bringing this to the NYRBG - this has to be one of the finest lambics that has ever touched my lips - the aroma defines earthy and funky - soft on the palate, especially for such a dry beer - champaign/chardonay flavors abound, with a tiny bit of apple cider sweetness underneath that never quite breaks through the sourness, but it is certainly there - a wonderful gueuze.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

340,"2006-07-01",4.5,"Lemon and yeast aromas. Nice off-white head which goes down leaving a thin layer of dense foam for the rest of the glass. Slightly hazy with a bright golden-orange color. Excellent tart lemon flavors with a yeasty backbone are perfectly balanced by a rich carbonation of delicate bubbles, ending with a refreshing sour aftertaste. A perfect summertime beer, although I plan to drink it year round. With beer this good, who needs lemonade?","Orlando, Florida, USA","abb73"
340,"2006-06-28",4.5,"Following my recent and rather lauding appraisal of the familial White Label, this beer could not have built more anticipation. This unfiltered version poured an expectably hazier and denser body, but its resinous pumpkin hue was no less alluring. The white foam rapidly recedes revealing a plethora of mouth-watering scents. Fruits are more noticeable on the forefront, particularly sweet apricots, peaches and a wonderful smultron aroma that accompanies those of sour apple and pear. Some of the tangy, terroir odors of Gruyère and grass that were so strong in the White Label are present here, in an albeit diluted fashion. A malty background composed of brown sugar and toffee highlighted by vanilla and oak, give the nose a very complete and balanced feel. The flavor benefits of a comparable evolution beginning with a dry, woody, Champagne explosion on the tip of the tongue, progressively shifting to a buttery, coating mouthfeel that resonates of caramel and honey flavors, sustained by a fruitier background of cherries and lemon. Somewhat rounder, softer, perhaps a tad more sour than the White Label and with notably less funk from the cheese and spice section. Emmental is nonetheless present in the long aftertaste, accentuated by notes of pepper and toast. Another exceptional gueuze that, to my palate, rises just above its filtered sibling by virtue of an incredibly pleasing texture, though it offers a slightly different bouquet. Both are worth your effort.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Pours a gorgeous apricot colored cognac forming a beautiful gradient in my glass, rimmed with a fine cicrcle of white bubbles.
Sour apple and wood on the aroma, hints of funk, hints of mustiness. The flavor is magnificant... ahhh.....lemon juice aged in oak barrels, rounding out dry, tannic, almost lactic.. Impressively tart and dry, fresh grapefruit, just hints of the barnyard character, exceptionally refreshing in very small sips. 

A fine warm-afternoon sipper, watching the France-Spain world cup match. This one deserves its stellar reputation. 8/5/9/4/16=4.2

Bottle; sour tasting at Naked City 8/6/09. This was a close second to Cantillon St .Lamvinus as the beer of the night, and perhaps tops that one out in complexity and depth though not perhaps in drinkability. Its superb; strong sparkly tart lemon, prickly and spiced and so clean. Interesting experiment for the future: this one vs. Cantillons gueuze.

Complex yeasty must in the aroma, acidic damp golden retriever, hay/straw. Mouth puckeringly sour first impression is offensive in its onslaught, but persistence is rewarded as it wanes with each brave sip. Sour-tart, fruity notes, akin to chewing a mouthfull of lemon seeds at times. Lingering lemon-grapefruit is surprisingly strong, gripping at the back of the throat.

340,"2006-01-09",3.4,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2006 I secured a couple of bottles of this from From the Vine in Columbus, Ohio.  And after this, I dont think I like lambic all that well.  Not that its bad or gross, I just dont think it does it for me.  Anyhowpopped this sucker open and it exploded lambic everywhere.  Fortunately I was near the sink and saved my floorfor the most part.  Once it stopped, and I was able to get it in a glass, I discovered that it was hazy orange and golden with a nice white head.  The aroma was very interesting with sour fruit (cherries), and light barnyard notes.  Full and crisp really.  The taste was nothing if not sour!  Not as sour as La Folie, but pretty darn sour.  I also managed to note some finishing tartness, and horse blanket (I think I actually get that description now).  Definitely funky.  Mouth feel was nice.  Smooth, medium body and finish.  Interesting, as with most lambics Ive tried, but this stuff is just not for me.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

Tart and sour throughout, with a high dose of acidity noted especially at the top of the throat.  Sour apples, old flowers, lime, and a hint of leather came through in the flavor.

340,"2005-09-19",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2011 Ive waited awhile to enjoy this one.  I popped the cork and was immediately met by the aroma.  A deliciously sour, cheesy, hay, vinegar, and upscale leather wafted from the bottle.  The flavor starts with a hugely salty and sour lime body that morphs to a mushroom jack cheese and leather glove.  It has a lingering lemongrass flavor.  When drinking this, youre met by a huge fizzyness that is like Pop Rocks exploding in your mouth.  So tart that it wrinkles ones face.  After drinking, its time to reflect how beautiful in appearance this beer is.  It radiates light like its creating the light.  The body is a shiny copper/bronze and has a thin, nearly non-existent white head.  For a gueuze, this is good stuff.  I wish it more leathery.  Granted, theres a lot in there, but its my world!

My god this is how it should be done. I can imagine it being brewed in a dusty old barn by an aged boffin with equipment that has stood the test of time and is held together with patches and cobwebs then ferried around in barrels pulled by a faithful old horse. It is simply amazing stuff. Full of funk and farmyard charateristics with lemon peel and other citric notes. Wonderful hazy golden body with a great head that lasts as long as your glass still contains liquid and some attractive chunky lace. Smoother than a lot of other lambics. Plenty of tart and sourness about it though. Sweet to begin with then waves of delicious tart and sour stuff come through with sandlewood, oak and leather later.

Im loving the aroma: hay, chamomile, freshly squeezed lime juice, lemon zest, burlap sacks, and a subtle spicing undercurrent of coriander and oregano.  First rush of flavor is like sinking the teeth into the juiciest sour grape known to man.  Souring and puckering while highlighting a yeasty funkiness.  Rhubarb, granny smith apples and light figs come to mind, cloistered amidst an effervescent persona and a light-to-medium body.

340,"2005-04-18",4.0,"I say... Nice Beer as I sit here rating away. 
 Poured a lovely golden mid summer sunset and thin high altitude clouds as a cap. The Aroma is white grapes, whole pressed Granny Smith apple, peel, stems, seeds and all. Its rather woody, damp and spoiled, moldy and compounded with wet hay. I love it! Its so grassy and acidic, its uniquely clean yet filthy with compost. There is such a fascinating allure to this style for me. Huge lemongrass suggestions vinegar like yet notes of sweetness pop in every now and again. I would say that this particular Gueuze is oakyer than most slightly mellowed, I think. The entier tasting experience is Dry as the fires in Hell.

The beer: Pours with a lemony, slightly hazy color with a small lacy head. Smells of lemon, grapefruit, fresh hay, leather, a hint of tarragon. Wonderful.
The taste is a mixture of a very funky, earthy bottom note reminiscent of burnt mushrooms and an explosion at the top of yellow citrus fruit. The finish is amazingly clean.

The aroma that escaped upon pouring reminded me of skunk, not ""skunky"" in the conventional sense, but the stench one occasionally encounters on extended car trips and someone has hit a skunk.

Not too much wasted.  Poured an orange gold color with a small white foamy head, with nice lacing.  The only surprise about the aroma is how good the vinegar, barnyard, leather, blankety and woodiness smells were.  The best of any lambic Ive tried.  Taste is extremely tart, very citrusy, and very good and funky, like my moms old handbag was soaked in it.  The sour/tart overtones stay throughout the bottle, and the finish is nice and smooth.

The aroma is very fruity -- underripe peaches and apricots, horse blanket musty. The flavor is definitely sour, it comes across as salty by somehow activating those sensors on the tongue, but the saltiness turns into a puckering tartness on the back of the tongue. The tartness doesnt overwhelm the rest of the beer, though as gree peach/apricot fruit mingles with a slight bit of sweetened toast malt. All of these flavors meld wonderfully into a complex and tasty lambic. Easier to drink than I expected, actually.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

340,"2005-02-07",4.3,"Bottle: Slightly hazy bright orange/amber color with a small white head.  This color has more of a bright orange color to it then Ive seen in other gueuze.  Wow, the aroma is really nice - sour lemon, unripened orange, grapefruit, wet straw, old leather, blue cheese, sweaty sock, old wood, cobwebs, dusty barnyard, fresh apple.  Taste is tart, but not overwhelmingly so.  Sour, sticky lemon and grapefruit hit my tongue initially, followed by a tart wheat, wet wood, sweet & sour cherry, honey for a brief second, and apples.  Sucking bubbles of air into my mouth really brings out the sour cherries and some moldy cheese notes.  This beer seems to effortlessly, though in a suble way, make the switch from sour to sweet and back again as jimmack04 has noted.    The more I drink, the more sweet and complex it seems to get. Finish lasts for a long time, also alternating sweet & sour, with notes of peach, apple, honey coated grains, dry wood, lemon rind.

340,"2004-12-20",4.8,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2010 Surprisingly dark golden yellow pour, moderately hazy, almost orangey. Amazingly balanced aroma. Huge sweet malt kiss complements the character loaded brettanomyces that come out horsey, cheesy and sweaty. Funky and clean at the same time, but above all elegant and farmy. Apparently sweet which have me anticipating a dessert gueuze. Notes of vanilla, cask wood, sand, earth. Indeed very sweet for a gueuze, this is not really what I was anticipating, but I can appreciate greatness when I taste it and this is just as good as Cuvée René with incredible nostalgic character. Pie crust and bread. Not very acid at all, just a balancing tartness. Honeyed maltiness gets overwhelmed by wood juice, powdery glue-like flavors. I dont really feels the taste was as good as the incredible aroma, but it does grow on me as it warms. It just has this terrific sandy dry-out effect that asks to be let on the table taking some air and breathing like fine wines. Gentle astringency, fitting low carbonation. Medium-full bodied and smooth on the tongue. One of the best in its kind and worthy of every bit of praise it gathers. Complex beyond imagination all while being insanely drinkable. Thanks again Per.  A further sampling confirms to me that the real girardin gueuze outclasses cuvée rené by a fair margin as my favorite gueuze. Highly drinkable yet very assertive. It just does everything as I want it and for now stands as the best Ive had, though some of those rare drie fonteinen look like they could stand up to its level.

This beer poured a fairly clear gold color with a thin soapy white head, which actually was more of a film and an active degree of carbonation. This is one of those beers that you could rate ten times and still have new things to say about it..so here goes. The aroma is funky cheese at its finest. Barnyard, leather, lemon, vinegar, citrusy esters, cheese and tartness. Sour nose, but a nice hint of sweetness. The taste is TART!!!! A sour super complex carbonated time bomb that just explodes in your mouth. You had better pucker up because this acidic, lemony, leathery, barnyardy, cheesy flavor is going to whoop you! Where did all of this carbonation come from..I saw some in the glass prior to tasting, but it just explodes in your mouth! This is definitely a total sipping beer! Good luck taking anything longer than a gulp of this.

Also on palate are some rough bitters. If it werent for the apple vinegar/sour cherries, this beer would be very difficult to handle because of its harsh acids.

Body is extra-full, like the Speedway of gueuzes.  This beer knows what it wants to showcase (A drinkability that is paradoxically, complimentary to the full body). But then Im still getting the apples, some musty old wool sucks that are wet from sweating in them.  Light citrus and green apples, with just huge tart yeast appeal.  It never gives up, I can still taste this stuff to perpetuity.  The thing is, this seems 180 degrees from Cuvee Rene, which is what I ""grew up on"", so I just cant get used to this stuff.  Its less sourness, less yeast barnyardiness and cheese, but I will admit to the body being better, with more full, round, actual sweet flavor.  Yes, its the sweet malt you can actually hang on to in this one, whereas with Rene, you have a pure tart finish.  I must admit to some bias against this one, when it comes to the overall score.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
340,"2004-11-03",4.8,"375 mL bottle brought back from Gent.   Beautiful, clear golden color with a tint of orange.  Nice head that lasts throughout and carbonation running up through it constantly.  Sour aroma with wonderful yeasty smell.  Delicious sweet & sour flavors play off of eachother along with that barnyard quality.  There is a cheese quality that is so balanced with the flavor profile it is amazing.  There are some citrus flavors, including orange.  It is tart but that is what sets it apart as a traditional gueuze.  It makes your mouth water!  Thank goodness for the yeast around Brussels.","Austin, Texas, USA","DewBrewer"
340,"2004-11-02",4.0,"First beer on election night 2004:
Crystal clear copper coloured body with a thin, big-bubbled white head. Aroma of barnyard, sour grapes, yeast, acid, some metal and a nice fresh fruit quality. Light-bodied; VERY tart lambic flavour up front with that pleasant wheat and apple taste, followed by a puckering tart acidity. Follow that with a dry grape and yeast taste and round it out with a sweet finish of caster sugar. Light bodied overall and the aftertaste doesnt stay too long. A damn good beer and a great bottle to try.

So amazingly complex that i just keeps sniffing it for the longest time before i taste it. Then the taste: acidic and sour, with a well rounded sweetnes to offset it. The balance is very very good. The black label is a wonderfull geuze.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Engelsmann"

All the wonderful lambic aroma you expect and more; cheese, mildew, apple, funk. I was most impressed with the balance and weight of the body of this gueuze, all on top of the complexity to be expected in the style. I was too busy enjoying this brew to take more thorough notes, but fortunately I have more.","Somerville, Massachusetts, USA","DrGonzo"
340,"2004-10-26",4.6,"Explosive pour as many noted. Fortunately I had the glass ready to avoid losing much. Dense orangey amber appearance, lively head formation. Strong vinegar aroma, cheesiness mildly pungent, fragrant, fresh roses, and a fair fruitiness, grapes, oranges. Tart, acidic flavor, but again pleasantly fruity and refreshing. Grapefruit, orange and raspberry, mildly spicy. I usually love lambics for their sourness and acidity, this has that in abundance but also does an excellent job of balance with the sweet fruitiness. Thanks to rauchbier for this one.","California, USA","BeerLimey"

Subtle but complex musty nose of sour fruit, barnyard, wood stain, oak, overripe pineapple, a phantom raspberry note, light grassiness and some brine. Lightly acetic flavor has characteristics of grapefruit, white wine, cider, citrus zest, brett and oak.  Crisp sourness but not overly acidic. Nearly dry finish but the pleasing flavor lingers very nicely. Fantastic beer.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"

my score is for a number of different bottles at a number of different ages.  the notes below are for only one or two vintages (probably 2-4 years old), but Ive come to see Girardin Gueuze as the pinnacle of gueuze blending.


extremely strong nose, crawling through the air after the cork is pulled, filling the room with a leathery and estery aroma. semi-sweet apple and driftwood nose.  semi-thick body, not overwhelming you with sourness like Cantillon. less acidic than other gueuze but magically vibrant and sharp when you get a stellar batch, the probabilities of which seem up in the air. oily palate late without coating.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

340,"2004-10-16",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 31, 2009 My store has had this for a while. I didnt realize what was stting on the shelf for a long time. I wished I had tried it earlier. Small, thin head tops the brew. The color is a deep amber with a little bit of cloudiness. Aroma is hay, lemons and a little vinegar. As you drink it also smells of apples and slight mustiness. The taste was a mouth puckering sourness that pops out at first and lets you know that this is a geueze. Tastes of sour apples and cherries. Also has some lime and a little bit of a cheese like a stilton? The finish is also a little bit salty. The mouthfeel of this is oily, but in a pleasant way. This gem deserves its high ranking. A true masterpiece of the style.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

I think this is the closest to heaven you will come to in a bottle.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Enniskillen"
340,"2004-10-15",4.7,"Pours a hazy gold, highly effervescent in the glass but not much head formation.  Aroma of musty cobwebs, pungent and sour but in no way offensive.  This is awesome!  The first sip is mouth-puckering sour, with notes of ripened fruit, grass, and sour candy.  Notes of funky cheese and yet more sourness in the dry, tart finish.

340,"2004-10-11",4.2,"10/7/04.  Poured out of 375 mL bottle, obtained in a trade with DavidP on RateBeer 10/2/04.  Deep golden amber color like hazy hay.  Nice dusty but blotchy lacing.  Very thinly lingering white head.  Awesome shimmer and sparkle on the lacing, but Id love it if the head were larger and more lasting.  Big funk and straw/grass flavors.  Also some honey/nectar with a touch of sweetness, but an overall dry character.  Almost like a moldy cheese (but not quite bleu cheese-- I dont know).  Dry cheesy funk with a smooth, slick, and then sharp mouthfeel.  Almost spicy pungency in the back of the throat.  Very nice, oily texture and then blotches of strong brett and candied lemon citrus sparkling all over the tongue.  Very complex and delicious.  With Drie Fonteinen, one of the best geuzes Ive yet had the pleasure to try.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"
340,"2004-09-29",3.5,"This is like walking into a damn manure pyle.  Lots of undergrowth, and vegetal horseblanket funk.  Sweat, even.  The flavor is there just under the surface once you can get past the vinegar and super sour flavors, there is a great balanced acidity and some interesting mineral qualities.  The funk is right here for you.  Finishes spicy and fruity and of course sour.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","harlequinn"

Taste: oooh, oooh, sourness itself, serious puckeration, but still refreshing and swift down the throat. Medium body, long, long slick, dry finish, leaves a serious coating in the mouth. This has got to be one of the better tasting gueuzes Ive ever had, though it still gives my senses a tumble, I remain powerless before its elusive character.
Halfway in, the sour attack on the tongue is not as harsh, and it slips ever easier down, feeling even thicker on the palate. I pass the night with a few of these, no problem. Pretty snappy gueuze they got goin on...","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

Big tart flavor, starts with the sweet flesh of a lemony grapefruit, bitter flower petals, and sweet ""deepness"" I cant put my finger on that happens towards the end.

340,"2004-08-26",4.2,"8.25.04  37.5CL bottle courtesy of CaptainCougar.  This is my introduction to top tier gueuze.  Cork dislodges easily and without episode, beer does not gush.  Pour is that of a hazy honey with little head and less visible carbonation.  Aroma is, honestly, stinky - barnyard, vinegar, rotting tomato and apple, honeysuckle, feet, woodshed.  The first sip is absolutely mindblowing.  Musty muddy barn - slop and old cheese and felled fruits and shit.  Harsh vinegar sourness.  Biting acidity insults on the finish.  A real teeth cleaner.  Aftertaste is all cheese, cheese, cheese.  Some spicey fresh green pepper (those banana peppers).  A lingering acidity does not eliminate some finishing sweetness - could this be a bad bottle?  As it turns out, I dont think Im ready for gueuze, or maybe today was not the day for it.

340,"2004-03-21",4.1,"And finally. The last two beers of the London Drinker festival . The Girardin and Oud Beersel gueuzes tasted side by side. Unfortunately, as these were beers number 29 and 30 of the day, I would be hard pressed to claim that my critical faculties were at their sharpest. I found the Girardin and the Beersel to be pretty closely matched and vying with the Drie Fonteinen for number one status. I think the Girardin just edged it. This was the black label version - the white label is often regarded as a different beer. The sharp lactic character was ideal for chivvying up the jaded palate from the days excesses. The Girardin is traditional and classy at the same time. It has the obvious cider tones that most other people mention and is not as harsh the Cantillon, say. Spicy citric tones too. Slips down a treat.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

340,"2004-01-26",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2004 I'm still weeping over this one. My wonderfully kind-hearted beer amigo, radiomgb, invited me over for a night of guezes. This nectar, our first of the evening, saw fit to burst forth in an eruption of reddish froth leaving us with only half the bottle to enjoy. and enjoy we did - I am a novice in general when it comes to rating beer, and even more so when it comes to the complexities of a lambic. 

I was overwhelmed by the cider and balsamic vinegar battle being waged in my nose as I admired the rich amber colour. Lots of apples and citrus and grapes in the cidery taste with a wonderful puckering tartness too. Very dry - leaves you almost as soon as you swallow. A great beginning to the night and my gueuze experience. Thanks Jeff.","Oshawa, Ontario, CANADA","beerhugger"

The waiter rather proudly told me this was a real beer of Brussels.  Light coppery appearance, good head.  Barnyard hay aroma.  Dry, tangy on the palate, pear, apples, some horseblanket.  Actually similar esters to the Mort Subite I had earlier, but quite dry and yummy.  The wife, incidentally, loved it.

340,"2004-01-01",4.8,"750 ml bottle (black label) at Hopleaf, Chicago, December 2003.  One of the biggest disappointments (there were a few) of my past summer and fall off Ratebeer was that I couldn't attend the RB summer party.  I knew that this was likely to be there, and further I recall a post (Psychprof maybe?) bemoaning the unlikelihood of it ever getting imported to the USA on a regular basis.  So imagine my surprise and joy when I walked into my now-new-favorite bar (sorry Map Room) in my favorite city and found this beauty waiting for me.  It was $18 and my friend wasn't sharing, so I was actually kind happy when the bartender spilled about 40% of the bottle and gave it to me for half price; happy until I tasted it.  What nectar!  Sour-apple-horseblanket-pipesmoke-pepper greets you on the nose.  Much sweeter than I had expected, sweeter than virtually any gueuze I've had (except the unexceptional Lindemans) but changing slowly and effortlessly into a joyous sourness at the finish.

Not to bad, I saved the majority of the beer.  Soft aroma, thats less intense the the Dire Fontinen but with some soft peach, hay and citric sourness. Moderately woody, with some apple flavors, peach, tart and sour, very dry.  The Soutness on this has to be experienced to be understood.  You swallow and then your mouth just puckers with an absolutely fantastic sourness.  Likely the most intense beer ive drank.

340,"2003-08-13",4.7,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2004 Sampled February, 2004; Hop Leaf, ChicagoThere is a pronounced and funky farm-house cheese aroma that wafts from my Gueuze tumbler as I pour this beer.  Coupled with this is a dry musty barnyard aroma, and of course a sour aroma as well.  The beer is brilliantly clear and a light amber-gold color.   It is topped by a creamy beige head that starts out quite big but falls to a persistent 1/8 inch head for most of my first glass.  The taste of the beer has a nice sour cidery character to it.  This is a sour beer, but it is not as mouth-puckeringly so like some Gueuzes.  Overall this is a nice light, refreshing, and spritzy beer, just like a good Gueuze should be.  The beer is also very dry, and finishes with a bit of woodiness.  This is dry, musty, and dusty, it reminds me of a wet Belgian hayfield in early spring.  This is an absolutely world class Lambic, that pairs wonderfully with my appetizer of mussels & French fries with a garlic aioli.  Though the beer is bone dry it develops a perceived sweetness when paired with my appetizer.  The food takes away nothing from the beer and the beer takes away nothing from the food, an absolutely stunning combination.
Sampled March, 2001Smells quite musty not that sour smelling, a bit of oakiness as well.  This beer is quite clear in appearance.  Tastes sour with an astringent oakiness to it as well.  Definitely going to have to try this one again.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Refreshing with a journey that starts with a hesitant sweetness and finishes dry as the Sahara desert on a dry day. No astringent nasties, just a clean, dry finish. But I didn't get the reason for the raves. I think this is a well made beer, tasty and refreshing, but a little one dimensional in it's flavour profile. Gueuze and dry cider seem to have taste experiences in common, though a dry cider has a greater range of flavours and is more complex.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

Attractive white head over a cloudy yellow body. First aroma and flavors were the barnyard ones I expected, with some sour zing.  Layers of flavor revealed a lovely citric, very lemon flavor, and then as I got closer to the bottom it produced more grapefruit notes, with a bitter grapefruit finish.  Musty, chewy flavors carried on throughout.  The acidic effect was a bit too much on top of a lamb madras earlier in the evening.  What a gem of a beer to find in a pub.

Goden colour with slight orangey shine. For a gueuze, remarkably stable head, dirty-yellow. Nose of 'horseblanket', fresh flowers, sulphur, green apples and drying hay. Very dry is the immediate impression, yet carbonisation all over the place - together with the tannines, the onslaught on the front teeth is complete, no tartar left - if I weren't a dentist myself, mine would be out of work, now. The real taste is purely retronasal; citrus, pineapple, green apple, lime, lactic (no acetic). Yet there is a strain of sweetness - like in 'speculaas' grain-biscuits Belgain style. Mouthfeel is undistinguishable from the taste, as above. Close my eyes, and I'm in a horse stable, the animal still steaming from the exercise, closeby the summerharvest of still hot grain, apples, straw is being stored.

340,"2002-03-19",4.5,"Pale amber coloured. Extremely complex with balanced, tart acidity.
One of few beers that combines being both very flavourful and very refreshing.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
340,"2001-11-13",4.9,"UPDATED: JUN 25, 2006 Golden-amber with chill haze.  Complex aroma of leather, pears, peaches, feet, dust, old wood and farmhouse cheshire.  Bracing acidity and extreme complexity of wood, cheese, acids, grapefruit, kumquat, pommelo and old saddle.  Insane complexity.  Brilliant balance.  Balls front intensity.  Fucking amazing.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
340,"2001-11-11",3.8,"Here you go Oakes.  Im glad Belgik made the manure comment because I didnt want to be the first.  Although this style certainly takes some getting used to, I think that the complexity of this beer needs to be recognized.  So much in the aroma, at first it comes as offensive, but quickly becomes more interesting.  Almost like biting into a lemon.  Has to be tried.  Dont let it intimidate you.","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","daboskabouter"
340,"2001-10-25",4.3,"Aroma:  smells like the region it comes from, during the worst cold weather rainy season, sour, associations with a livestock barn, manure...
Flavor:  very intense, sour, enlivens saliva, slight bitter and tannic substance
Palate:  complex, rather short foam-in-mouth impression, long sour aftertaste
Appearance:  after having stood upright, limpid clear coppery hue (otherwise yeasty-haze); foams but little upon pooring and foam ebbs away quickly, leaving but few specks of dustlike yeast floating on top; swirling brings back sparkling-wine-like bubbles.
Overall:  a very ecological impression, definitely animal-like agricultural
associations, very complex, long in the mouth and with a long-lasting aftertaste.
Definitely different, authentic Bruegel and Hyronimous Bosch beer.","Sterrebeek, BELGIUM","Belgik"
