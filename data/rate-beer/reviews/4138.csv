4138,"2017-05-02",4.2,"Batch 1 bottle courtesy of Linus. Clear pale golden pour leaving some pronounced legs on the glass with a swirl. Nose-tingling ginger & fresh American oak nose. Moist soil & hints of damp moss. Very light floral honey & vanilla hard candy. Sweet, spicy & earthy taste. Round, slightly viscous & oily mouthfeel. Very balanced with ginger, honey & barrel all playing their parts in harmony. Light very suiting barrel mellowness which impressed me. Very nice!","Göteborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"

4138,"2017-04-29",4.6,"Bottle shared at schramms balcony bonanza. With schramm ginger as probably my least favorite schramm, this is just another level, the bourbon barrel has added Some kind of magic to it, still a lot of ginger, but all of it is masked by bourbon vanilla sweetness, charred oak, coconut light nuts, more honey sweetness, orange and ginger root spice. Taste is more smooth, more sweetness of the barrel, vanilla and ginger. Incredible to see how the barrel adds a huge difference to the base","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"
4138,"2017-01-16",4.7,"Regular ginger is probably my least favorite Schramms offering, but that barrel has done some wonderful things here. The ginger spiciness is mellowed by the barrel which has imparted a nice, smooth almost vanilla flavor with some oak. Bourbon is pleasant but mild and definitely not the showcase but a nice part of the total sum. Very nicely balanced, highly enjoyable.","Ohio, USA","dakingindanorf"

4138,"2016-12-29",4.3,"Aging Ginger in bourbon barrels was a good idea. Smoother than Ginger, with a subtle oak flavor that lingers along with the tamer spiciness.","","CountPrattula"
4138,"2016-12-29",4.4,"Regular Ginger is not my favorite because Im not a huge fan of ginger in general. The barrel treatment cuts some of the spiciness and adds a nice hint of oak and vanilla. Big step up for me from the regular Ginger.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","FrankHammer"
4138,"2016-12-29",4.1,"Im not a huge ginger fan, but the barrel aging has certainly calmed down the robustness of the typical ginger. Smooth and silky.","Canton, Michigan, USA","lbnlaxer"
4138,"2016-12-29",4.4,"Excellent ginger aroma and taste, while I prefer the berry/cherry meads Lord Jim is an excellent mead of its style. The entire time i was drinking it I was thinking how well it would pair with a peach cobbler.","Michigan, USA","jalford4"
4138,"2016-11-28",3.9,"375 mL bottle. Clear pale yellow. Smells of lots of ginger, light honey, and a hint of bourbon, or maybe Im imagining it. Tastes of very light honey. Strong ginger that permeates throughout. Just a little bit of bourbon, but the oak lingers in the finish. Medium body. Very nice mead, but not my favorite Schramms.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
4138,"2016-11-07",4.6,"Great idea here, love the balance the barrel adds to the original mead. Schramms, mead and barrels. Hard to mess that up!","","Jb123"

4138,"2016-10-31",4.3,"Really interesting mead. Dont think ive had a ginger mead before but im definitely into it. Aroma is soft ginger, but the mead is a bit cold and needs to warm a bit. The flavor is spicy and delicious. Very different. I dont get heavy bourbon barrel, but its definitely there. Very smooth and enjoyable, something I could sip on for hours.","","BrandNewBrew"
4138,"2016-06-10",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 13, 2016 From notes. Had this one at Merays for a Drink the Beers event at his work on June 06. This one was poured from a labelless 375 mL bottle. This one was opened by Ashley. Thanks man! This is a treat! The pour is a pale, syrupy yellow without a lick of head or carbonation. It looks like a damn good mead. The aroma is big ginger. Just like the regular one, you really have to like ginger to appreciate what this is. Fortunately for me, the bourbon barrel does a lovely job at cutting some of the intense sharpness of the ginger. The regular is a little too much, but this is just toned down enough. The flavor is just as it smells. There is a huge ginger with a nice honey addition and a lingeringly smooth bourbon. There is just a little woodiness on the back end, but this thing balances out beautifully. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy and everything you come to expect from a lovely Schramms mead. Im not a ginger fan, and this was pretty excellent. Damn!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
