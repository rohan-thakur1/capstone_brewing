2037,"2014-11-30",3.8,"750ml bottle, shared with the staff at Dutchs. Mostly clear golden orange color, with lots of very-fine particles suspended in the body. Thin ring of off-white head, leaving good ropes and dots of lace. Satisfyingly oaky flavor, lemon-citrus and acidity, some mild belgian-type yeast, light spiciness, and good bigger farmhouse barnyard funky flavors. Medium body. Smooth, kind of crisp, lighter carbonation. Lightly slick in the mouthfeel. Satisfyingly moderate sour taste, lighter to moderate sweet. Wonderful big oaky and lightly citric flavor. Great, sour golden ale. Not really like any biere de garde Ive ever had -- lacks that big, soft, highly carbonated spicy mouthfeel that is common with the style, but I dont miss that aspect at all. Do get the a lot of oaky funkiness and mild spiciness that is reminiscent of traditional examples, though. Just like Jolly Pumpkin is known to do, this example of biere de garde takes a lot of liberties... with pleasing results.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
2037,"2014-11-14",4.3,"Bottle @ home, thanks to readbaron. This beer rocks! Hazy golden orange appearance with a thin white head. The carbonation is a bit dull but this is an otherwise great beer. Theres a massive amount of bubblegum, pineapple / tropical fruit brett, and candy in the nose. Some moderate acidity - both lactic and acetic. Some cheese, lots of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, and pineapple. Theres vanilla and oak in there as well. Moderately tart. Tons of candy. Low bitterness and sweetness. If the carbonation was higher, this would be a 4.5-4.6. Supremely chuggable. JesusOfCO- this is what you should be aiming for. Fuck yeah.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"

White wine, lemons, musty cork, and lots of stone fruit, like unripe peach. Taste is moderately sour and acetic with lemon juice, oak tannins, unripe peach, light honey, and green mango.

2037,"2013-03-11",4.4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/29/2011.  Fast gusher upon opening as expected, but didnt lose any.  Pours very cloudy golden straw color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy bright white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers.  Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming off the sediment.  Aromas of huge tart lemon, peach, sour apple, pear, apricot, pineapple, pepper, clove, oak, hay, straw, funk, and earthy spiciness.  Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity, spicy, and funk notes.  Taste of big peach, tart lemon, sour apple, pineapple, pear, apricot, clove, pepper, hay, straw, oak, funk, light leather, and earthy spiciness.  Moderate tart acidity on the finish; with lingering notes of tart lemon, peach, pear, sour apple, pineapple, apricot, clove, pepper, hay, straw, oak, light leather, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a while.  Fantastic complexity and balance of tart fruity, spicy, and funk flavors; with nearly zero cloying flavors present after the finish.  Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a crisp, acidic, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is very nice.  Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish.  Overall this is an absolutely incredible barrel aged wild golden ale.  Huge complexity and balance of tart fruity, spicy, and funk notes; and very smooth to sip on.  A highly fantastic offering.

Came on my hand after popping the cap. Nothing measurable lost though. Lovely honey look, a touch cloudy, and a few of sinky bits. Slightly pineapply aroma, but a nice lambickiness too, touch of apricot. Body much more apricotty. Certainly reminiscent of Cantillons bretty body, but this is quite a lot stronger. Theres a fair bit of grapefruit and citrus in the retronasals, and alas theres some wafting of alcohol that comes across with that. Not never as booze, simply as a vapourousness. Yeast and crap are something you dont want to worry about, this is lovely and crisp without additional crap, and is pleasantly mellowed by adding it all.

It pours a slightly hazy old with a fizzy bright white head that dissipates rather quickly with no lacing.

The smell is really sour, I was surprised. It has a tingly passionfruit nectar scent along with some sour green apple, tangerine, lemon, and pineapple. There are some sweet malts in the background accentuating the tropical nature. There is some flowery/herbal scents going on too. There is a slight funk but not too much, more of just a slightly funkier saison yeast.

The flavor is interesting. It is nicely sour with sour green apple peel, lemon zest, and acid. There is a bit more funkiness going on with a long funky aftertaste. There is a tiny bit of hops and oak. This one is mostly sour.

The aroma is full of fun bugs. Very tart, vinegar, lemon rind, some apricot, and a little funk.

The flavor is nice and sour. The flavor starts and stays sour the whole time, with a lot of lemon, some apricot, and some grassy notes playing in the forefront preventing the Brett from wreaking havoc on my palate. Some spicy notes and a little oak add some depth. 

The body is definitely on the light side, with medium carbonation. The tartness creates a nice puckering sensation without being over the top. Overall I find the feel works well with the flavors.

Pours a golden colour with a white, somewhat lacy head. Aroma of strong citrus and sweet fruits. Flavour of pale malts, citrus, strong wood and of course Jolly Pumpkin like sourness, which reminds me of a light gueuze. Medium bodied, slick mouthfeel and a lovely sour, somewhat fruity finish. No pumpkin in this bottle.","Tampere, FINLAND","lusikka"

Soft vanilla notes and a nice maltiness to the nose as well. On tasting, light tartness and farmyard. Bit of oak and a rounded ester profile that works nicely.

Pours hazy yellow with a thick white head recedes quickly to a thin white collar of lace.  The nose has the signature Jolly Pumpkin sour funk, along with lemon pith, a hint of lactic creaminess, and some light cereal and hay malts.  The flavor is the same, starting with the light malts, and moving on to lemon pith, a lactic note, and finishing with the funky barnyard.

2037,"2011-04-30",3.5,"Slightly hazy golden coloured body with a very thin whtie head and almost no movement at all. Light of citrus, honey, sour grapes, sour cherries, oak, viognier, apricots and a little touch of coriander seed. Light to Medium-bodied; Sharp oaky and pungent malt flavour with a lot of citrus, lemons, light spices and a touch of the honey and honeysuckle. Aftertaste is quite complex with a touch of barnyard notes, yeast and some floral notes. Overall, a good and complex beer, but lacking in strong flavours, carbonation and some other notes - but a good beer, just not amazing and not necessarily a biere de garde. I sampled this 75 cL bottle purchased at Merchants in Dearborn, Michigan two days earlier on 28-April-2011 for US$16.99! sampled at a friends house in Northville, Michigan on 30-April-2011.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
2037,"2011-02-14",2.8,"It pours a golden straw color, not unlike any macro brewed swill, at least until the yeast arrives. Appearances, however, are the last thing standard about this brew. It opens very fruity with a pronounced tart finish. The malty sweetness blends with hints of vanilla and an estery sweet-tart carbonation as it rolls around the tongue. The tartness can be a bit much alone, but it pairs nicely with many dishes or cheeses and its lighter body belies the supposed 7.5 percent ABV and 1067 original gravity, according to the brewers notes. While it certainly doesnt seem that strong, it is very complex. I found hints of tannins, citrus lemon, and pineapple over the course of the bottle. 

That all said, this ale is probably not for everyone. The tartness can be offsetting and its complexity is pretty standard for most Belgian yeast strains. As a biére de garde (""beer for keeping""), Im also not sure how the lighter body will hold up if this beer is aged--per the label suggestion--up to a decade ...although, I have a feeling it will do nothing but sour for the worse.

Its a nice brew, very interesting, but nothing extraordinary.

2037,"2010-04-16",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
This fruity Sour Ale harbors white grape and citrusy notes throughout, developing diplomatic sourness in a light wooden finish.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the misty golden.
-Lactobacillus is rampant, especially in the nose.
-The grain bill appears simple, even though the bacteria have added quite a bit of motion around these cereals.
-I was expecting more sourness based on the lacto-filled aroma.

2037,"2008-11-27",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2009 In short: An extra-sharp semi-funky blonde ale.  Very Good.
How: Bottle 750ml, about 5 months old
The look: Cloudy yellow body topped by a medium white head with medium retention 
In long: Nose is medium funky, this is nowhere as wild as Leelanau White Whale.  From the nose this is more like a farmhouse Saison than a funky/bretty Jolly Pumpkin/Leelanau beer.  Taste is rather hard-hitting for such a low abv beer.  Aggressive carbonation, sharp spicy bitter hops, crisp honeyed biscuits, pineapples, strong minerals sensation, some lemon, a little oily.  That beer felt like a Sprite blended with a semi-funky ale.  The beer is rather dry and tart.  As it warmed up lemony meringue was becoming a dominant flavour.  This is a very good beer but considering Leelanau/Jolly Pumpkin line-up I was expecting James Brown funkiness but I got something that was well executed, effective, straightforward, and as funky as AC/DC.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2037,"2008-11-01",3.8,"A hazy, yellowish-golden body is topped with a mountain of dense, craggy foam that sticks around for ages.  Thick, foamy sheets and flares of lacing coat the glass very well.  Abundant, effervescing bubbles constantly feed the foamy crown.  The aroma shows a pilsner malt base, sweet and doughy, along with chardonnay grapes, lemongrass, orchard fruits, lavender, and heaps of bready yeast.  The oak influence is soft, imparting more of a light woody scent than the typical vanilla notes.  Similarly, the bretty funk is on the mild side.  Flavors are very similar, vinous chardonnay, sweet bready malts, crisp lemongrass, and musty oak all showing through.  Apples and grapes lend tartness, while flowers and herbs add perfumy, spicy depth.  The mouthfeel is substantial and lightly fizzy, with a semi-dry, bretty finish that lingers.  This might be the most herbal of all the Jolly Pumpkins, and the brett presence milder than most.  Interesting brew.  Quite nice.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Fading into a light ring and quaint brussels lace with each swirl, I raise my glass to my lips to quaff my very first Biere de Garde, Good Harbor Golden. First her nose; crisp bitter lemon, fresh almost rank sourdough mingles with summer apples and fresh pear. Her body is light and fruity as it caresses my tongue and leaves a more sweet impression on my palate then her initial sour assault. Airy with nice carbonation. After a while, Good Golden Harbor settles into a smooth, effervescent brew with a sweet and sour blend of lemons, sourdough, and apples. A pleasant finish for my first time.

I have no other Biere de Gardes to compare the Good Harbor Golden from Leelanau Brewing too, but what I did taste I enjoyed. Very reminiscent of saisons, yet still able to stand on her own, I look forward to meeting more of her varied and widespread sisters.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Funky aromas with notes of brett, oak, wheat and underneath it all some tropical fruit.  The more I sniff the more I catch some malt liquor qualities with heavy malt and a hint of alcohol. Light sweet start, a triple type sweetness that carries throughout. Some sweet floral hops work there way in the middle. More tart than sour, but yet there are some sweet sour flavors. Quite quenching for a brew this formidable. A loaf of bread, some cheese and this in a basket would make for a great afternoon in the countryside.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

2037,"2008-08-22",3.6,"This beer is contract brewed at Jolly Pumpkin.

Pours clear gold, with a light chill haze. A three-inch head of dense white sank slowly, and a partial skim-coat remained for the duration. A few strings of lacework also.

Aromatics are lemony, hay-like, and brightly acidic. Slightly lactic, with plenty of wheat twang and grapefruit.

Light bodied and crisp. Tart and quenching mouthfeel.

The pallet delivers what the nose promised. Lemon zest, wet hay, grapefruit pith, and clean acid. Slightly prickly on the back of the throat.

Finishes with plenty of lemony tartness and cut grass on the farm.

This ones a bit cleaner than the JP brews in that the lactic quality is minimal, while the acid is bright and clean. Some more funk would be nice, especially some brett.

2037,"2008-07-16",3.8,"A softer pour produces an almost three-finger thick, pale, off-white colored head.  The beer is a light honey / gold color that shows a hazy, straw-gold color when held up to the light.  The head leaves a layered lacing pattern on the sides of my glass as I work my way through this beer.  The aroma has a bright, grassy grain character to it, a certain soft mustiness and even a hint of something like barnyard funk (though only the beginning stages of this last).  Fruit aromatics of pear and tart, slightly under-ripe plum also play a significant role as does some floral and herbal aromatics that add a nice edge to the nose.  This has quite a complex nose to it that makes this quite interesting and quite enjoyable to smell.

Still well carbonated, despite losing a quarter of its contents en route to me (which really means it must have started out excessively carbonated).  The carbonation provides a nice textural component as well as accenting a peppery note that adds to the overall spiciness of this brew.  This is quite spicy too with fermentation derived notes of ginger, white pepper and higher alcohols which all combine to give this brew a sort of piquancy.  This has a nice, light tartness to it, but not much in the way of sweetness; the tartness accentuates fruit flavors of pear, melon and a certain character that makes me thing of some floral honey varietal.  The higher alcohols provide a touch of heat to the finish at times, almost a bit like a spicy ginger or horse-radish would.  This is highly quaffable and in fact drinks lighter than your typical 7.5% abv beer would.  

This is a very enjoyable brew, I wouldn’t really characterize it as a Bier de Garde, but many of Jolly Pumpkin’s style designations are by inspiration only anyway.  Still this is quite a tasty brew, one which I am happily quaffing.  This doesn’t seem to have anything beyond a normal Belgian yeast strain funkiness to it (despite the notes in the nose), though it is certainly a characterful strain at the very least.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2037,"2008-04-26",3.9,"750mL Bottle. Thanks Sean! Salty, low-lying malt aroma. A bit of dusty breath carries through some light Brett and grain reductions. Pours a crystal clear, really dense rich gold, a truly brazen sun and lemon yellow. Fuming bubbles. A lilting, rocky opalescent white head floats above.  Flavor is soft, smooth and generally agreeable. A wheat cracker is glazed with lemon curd. Soft alcohols, balanced acidity. Explosive. Fresh. Salty. A very plain, soft grassy beer. Theres not an exceptional amount of beer. But the wildness blends well and the malt sugars are clean and straight forward. A clean acidity. Ragingly drinkable. Parches the palate and leaves me refreshed. A nice rendition, but lacking necessary complexity.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Dies off to a more earthy and subdued woody character. Flavor brings a severe complexity. The first thing I think is cheese (most specifically brie). Why bother picking up half a pound at the Bedford cheese shop when you can get it here. Actually. It just makes me want to take a bite out of some hunk of cheesy goodness. Great thinner mild fruit tones. Body is very nice. Smooth carbonation on a consistent liquid body. Extremely drinkable. I dont usually like this style, but this is good. Definitely unique.

2037,"2008-01-25",3.6,"750mL bottle, courtesy of yjb.  Thanks, Yaniv!  Pours a hazy, whitish-honey color; fluffy, bright-white head with great retention and lacing coating the glass; an ideal pour.  Very pleasant aroma: mild brett presence, lemony dish soap, honey, and wheat; a fair amount of tartness perfectly integrated into a dry, dense background.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: nice jolt of brettiness and zesty citrus at the forefront; good levels of acidity, tartness, and fullness of flavor; perhaps a bit over-carbonated, which serves to cover up a bit of the citrus and honey and sugar within; lots of wheat coming through mid-palate; a drinkable, refreshing, tart beer, but the carbonation begins to detract a bit after the first few sips; sharp on the tongue.  Medium finish showing lemons and additional citrus and some honey; a bit of doughiness comes through at the very end.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

Smells like a big ol hunk of blue cheese, and tastes even funkier. The taste is bretty and acidic, but well balanced with sweet malts, and a surprising amount of hoppiness. Fruity and tart. Over carbonated and a bit too full in the mouth for the style.

2037,"2007-12-11",3.4,"750 ml bottle
I brought this to the tasting to kick things off with an easy palateable beer before the heavy stuff came out.  As soon as we had a quorom this was popped open.  Immediately a huge gush of foam surged over the top before we could get it to the sink.  It continued to do so until about half the bottle was poured out.  This was a great sessionable beer that one could easily drink alone.  Im not sure I would do so at $9.99 a bottle though.
Aroma / Appearance - The cloudy golden body left a bubbly two finger head, most of which was from the gushing head.  Honey, wheat and a slight hoppiness gave it a great but simple aroma.
Flavor / Palate - The taste flows quickly over the tongue so it takes a while to pick up the light lemon and honey flavors.  It does not intrude at all, quickly getting out of the way.  I found it to be relatively solid but it did not set my world on fire.  This is worth a try if you want a change of pace from big beers but otherwise there might be better ways to spend a ten dollar bill.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Funky brett aroma of leather, sour lemons, barnyard, and hints of tropical fruit, mainly pineapple.  There seems to be a subtle residual sugar sweetness as well, as the nose already doesnt seem as dry as most JP beers.  Medium light bodied, creamy wheat malt body with a spritzy, prickly carbonation and a mild acidity.  Fairly dry, but has a noticeable pale malt sweetness up front on the palate.  Lightly tart, with funky sour lemon flavors and a mild phenolic spice.  More pineapple.  Pretty tasty overall, but the musty brett funk and dry oak characters seem to clash a bit with the malt body; I think a bit more dryness would help round it out some more.

Pours a very pale gold color with a pretty substantial head at first that dies quickly and leaves little lacing and a bit of a thin coat of bubbles across the surface.  Aromas are an acrid mix of spices that promises a very tart flavor down the road.  The nose is a little off-putting... In spite of that, the flavor is one of the more palatable that Ive had by Jolly Pumpkin (err... Leelanau).  Pineapple sweetness is a good description of the beginning flavors, and this develops into a bit of a sour transition and then a lemon-grass finish.  All of this with a kind of musty and yeasty backdrop.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

I wish JP could make more stuff this well balanced with sour and light Belgian flavors.  I really could just enjoy this all the time.

This seems to be a different batch and its become a little different, more of a sour, acidic, and very tart brew.  Lost those light sweet Belgian flavors, which is ok because I love the added acidity.  It does seem to be different than the JP sour stuff, particularly in the acidity department, a lot more lambic-like, so I am not sure how differently the barrels were treated.
