2869,"2017-05-31",4.4,"From notes. Enjoyed at a tasting at Corbets on May 18. 750 mL bottle, 2016 vintage. The pour is a foggy golden straw color with a thicker white head that falls down slowly, leaving a good bit of soapy lace behind. The aroma is lightly tart up front. I like this. The citrus is delicate and there is a good bit of honey sweetness that takes on a little spiciness as it warms. This is great. The flavor is much of the same. The honey addition to this really changes the complexity. The light tartness and good solid fruitiness really resonate with some light grassiness and a hint of spice. The mouth feel is crisp and clean with a bright carbonation and a lingeringly sweet and floral finish. I like this one a lot. The wine makes this really delicate and balanced. I need a little more.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
2869,"2017-05-11",4.2,"I first had this at FoFa but as Id overindulged among the sour splendor I had very little recollection of it. The 2nd time around it was a 750ml I shared to celebrate a buddy hitting a milestone (10,000 rates - wow!) so I have a much clearer memory of it and also way better notes. A very pale opaque straw gold with a soft wheaty peppery aroma. Quite full bodied with a tart white wine acidic edge and an overall soft feeling. Great and easy to drink. The most beautiful thing about this beer is that while it is complex enough it has an ultra-soft body which means this is one of those rare Top beers you could easily down a whole bomber of yourself and then say ""I kind of want another one"".","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
2869,"2017-05-10",4.4,"Bottle shared at KyotoLeftys 10,000th rating celebration. Big funky and fruity nose, with some honey and some manure-like notes. Hazy pale straw color. Tart citrus flavor, morphs into tangy stone fruit, a touch a honey, and a bit of peppery hop bitterness. Thin-medium body, light astringency, and wonderfully soft on the palate. Great stuff. Gentle fruit, which develops a lot of richness throughout.","Hirakata, JAPAN","maekchu"
2869,"2017-05-05",4.3,"Bottle, shared at my 10K rating celebration. Dry, crisp citrus nose, honey, wheat, hay, grapefruit, a bit of ripe stone fruit. Pale pastel yellow with a low, fine head. Tart, tangy flavor, orange and lemon, honey, grassy, some white grape. Quite bitter, lightly funky, wheaty. Crisp, ethereal body. Awesome.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
2869,"2017-04-15",3.9,"750 ml bottle, thanks to Adam Chandler and Heather_B on this share. Lightly hazy gold color. Aroma is lemons, yogurt, dried flowers and a earthy element. The flavor is kind of balanced but right now it is showing a strong sourness through out the sip.
Tart, with a earthy funk. Bone dry texture. Wine influence is lost under the sour / tartness. I know why most enjoy this, for my own taste it is a but over the top sour for me.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
2869,"2017-02-27",4.2,"Bottle courtesy of Jacob. Hazy tiny burnt yellow pour with a frothy white head.

2869,"2017-02-24",3.9,"Bottle - Lemon and wet grassy notes with some nice funk. Cloudy gold with a decent white head. Nice aspirin sourness, citrus and light funk. Typical for them, good, but similar to many others they do.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2869,"2017-02-24",3.8,"Cloudy and pale. Thin head. This was a bit of a gusher. Aroma has a whack of brett and barrel, with a kiss of sweet malt. On the palate, sweet pale malts, a lot of brett, and then at the end of it you do get this barrel character. Overall not actually that complex, just a nice sweet pale malt brett beer. I feel like the brett character maybe does obfuscate the dandelion, though the latter does show up a bit in the finish.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
2869,"2017-02-24",4.2,"750mL bottle, sent from yourilevesque (thanks a lot, Youri), pours a clear golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out lots of Belgian yeast, followed by brett and maybe a hint of floral notes. Flavour is wonderfully funky, with loads of Belgian yeast, brett yeast, and lovely white wine barrel notes. Funky, vinous and brett. Complex and elegant, with everything in wonderful balance. Wonderful.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2869,"2017-02-20",4.4,"Merci à Guillaume pour le partage en jour de Drink It Now! Marc-André avait un verre bien différent du mien. Look encore une fois de farmstead bien fraîche, voilée, magnifique! Mousse moyenne, le tout bien appétissant. Belle barrique de vin au nez! Vraiment très rafraîchissante, légère, bien acidulée et balancée. Une bière parfaitement adaptée à la saison estivale, en ce 19 février. Quà cela ne tienne, on ne se laisse pas arrêter. Comme le fait remarquer à raison Guillaume, une texture qui sapparente à une Berliner Weisse. Un touche sûrette sans être acide, une bulle vive, une bois présent. Le pissenlit? Je le cherche, bien que je note indéniablement un côté floral qui me projette 3 mois en avant. Finale bien sèche, cette bière ne ressemble pas aux autres bières que brasse Shaun. Jen profite pour le remercier car je découvre ici un produit tout-à-fait unique et distingué.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

Hazy yellow with a small creamy white head. Aroma is typical Hill Farmstead funk, fruity, floral and light herbal character, citrus, a touch of grapes, oak, some minerals.

2869,"2017-01-30",3.9,"Bottle... Pours lightly hazed and yellow with a huge, short-lived, white head. The aroma offers notes of white wine and lemons with a faint dandelion aspect. Not very floral overall. No array of blossoms, just specifically dandelions here. Ive enjoyed previous dandelion saisons as well. Theres no honey here. Light-bodied with adequate carbonation. The flavor features tart and dry white wine, oak, lemons and rustic grains. Finishes moderately citric, mildly astringent, and then bone-dry. Woodsy and fruity overall. Bottle shared by the south Florida crew! Much appreciated.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

2869,"2016-11-10",3.4,"Bottle drunk 11/5/16.Clear, brassy-golden body is topped by a white head of moderate to low retention.Big lactic and brett acids pervade the nose and plentiful lemon and yogurt notes are garnered. Seems very dry and sour from the nose with strong pepper phenols and a very sparse wheat and cracker background. No alcohol or flaw.Very dry, tart and rather thin, to be honest. Was very unimpressed with the extremely thin, over-sour Florence that we had prior, and this is only better by a bit. Yogurt, citrus rind, lots of pepper character and just incredibly high attenuation leaving only crackery, grainy wheat in its wake. Even the carbonation is a bit loose. There are some fun citric notes, and good minerality but no interesting wine character. Last years non-wine barrel Vera Mae was roughly a billion times better.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2869,"2016-11-07",4.0,"Thanks Huhzubendah for sharing the bottle! Poured into a taster showing well filtered honey gold with just a little bit of white foam around the rims. 

The nose shows light apricot and tangerine notes with no citric edge with a light tartness and undertones of honey. 

The palate is light bodied and highly carbonated. Moderately tart with flavors of grapefruit and apricot with a very light citric edge mixed with bretty funk here and there.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"
2869,"2016-10-29",4.1,"New Entry! YAY! Acquired in August 2016. First year I wasnt able to help pick flowers. Sorry Shaun. Sat upright at 40F for 2 months and split 2 ways in Teku glassware.

A - Looks like Vera of yore. An orange, golden glow, incredible clarity with a solid white tight bubbly head of 2 fingers that fades to a thin line. Huge whip of air on the cap-pop but no gushing.

S - Smells great even young, Earthy, juicy, orange skins, floral, herbal with a peppery grass-like smell and tart brett.

T - Holy Hell. This is amazing! Its so wine forward, so tannic, acidic but not sour. Juicy sweet oranges and lemon juice. Tart then the sweetness fades mid-way through and youre left with this likely tart wheat cracker flavor with hay-characteristics and oak. 

M - Fantastic carb, tingly on the tongue but then it thins out at the end. 

O - I thought this being so young in the bottle that it wouldnt develop so many great flavors. I cant wait to see how this tastes 2 years from now!","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
2869,"2016-10-20",4.3,"Bottle at Earth Eagle, shared by one of this years foragers. A fantastic saison that manages to combine the vegetal/herbal flavor from the dandelions and the dry, funky fruitiness of wine barrel aging. The product is ridiculously good, even by Hill Farmsteads very high standards. This is a close-to-perfect saison.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

Taste is quite Arthur-like (certainly not a bad thing) with more of the citrusy white wine and honey. Moderately tart and dry. Drinkable for days. Body is light to medium and carbonation moderately high. Vinous. Just another awesome white wine BA saison by HFS!

2869,"2016-10-01",4.7,"At FoFA and multiple bottles at home. One bottle was a slow gusher. First pour of bottles were all clear bright golden while every other pours were hazy straw/golden with a medium white head, good retention, leaving little lacing. Tantalizing aromas of white wine, dandelions, lemon, Hill Farmstead microflora, bright mineral notes, lovely floral presence and honeyed notes. Taste has just the right amount of tartness for this beer with delicate white wine presence, floral notes (Im not getting dandelions here), lemon, honeyed notes, delicate but supportive cereals backbone, soft minerality, very mild oak spiciness and some funk. Medium body. Medium cushy carbonation. Winey but never tannic mouthfeel. Kind of fluffy as well. Moderately dry finish but it still let the amazing complexity of flavors lingers for a while. Theres even a soft salty touch at the complete end of each sip. This beer is very close to perfection combining wonderful complexity with great drinkability, qualities from the barrel agind with plenty of distinct features of the base beer. Bright all along from the citrusy features to the wine character. Without a doubt my favorite Hill Farmstead beer so far.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Gold, hazy, short duration; white grape, honey/wildflower tannic (think: elements of Cassidy); spritzy, reminds me of a sweetened champagne. Nice balance between grape, light sweetness, gently tart.
