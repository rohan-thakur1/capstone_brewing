4315,"2016-02-24",4.0,"This is the kind of perfectly good British beer that helps you remember why you ever liked British beer in the first place, and that a beer doesnt always have to be hop forward to be flavorful and tasty. Also, this is pro level stuff. I mean by that: it starts with a sweet dark malt front, but its more of a molasses type sugariness (where molasses itself isnt actually very sweet). There are virtually no hop flavors or aromas, but there is a mild spicy bitterness to balance out the finish, but mostly the balance achieved by the fact that the beer is fermented out to a semi-dryness, so its never cloying and thus it doesnt actually need a hop wallop to tame it. Amazingly light and drinkable for the relatively higher ABV. Only complaint is cosmetic, it was dark, cola-like, with minimal head - though the lower carbonation did wonders for the maltier body.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast notes; with good strength.

Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding English porter style. All around awesome balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV.

4315,"2014-12-17",4.0,"Pours an opaque dark brown similar to a stout, but not black. Well below average head, lacing and retention. Outstanding nose of dark fruit (plum, fig), sweet chocolate, slightly burnt molasses and just a hint of alcohol. The nose is similar to that of an Olde or Scott Ale, but lighter - as is the flavor profile. Light medium body with a hint of slickness. Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the finish. The outstanding flavor profile is reasonably intense, very complex and masterfully balanced. The beginning to middle is a blend of flavors that slowly fade allowing subsequent identification. All flavors of the nose are present and basically cascade from burnt molasses to dark fruit and then into a light bitterness followed by a chocolate note and associated sweetness. The finish is a slow fade of malty sweetness with a hint of alcohol and a bit of hop and alcohol bite.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

August 2013 500ml brown bottle from Sainsburys. Absolutely love it. This is my kind of beer. Im going back for some more. Good malt flavours, with a touch of Port. Soft, creamy mouthfeel. Pleasant rough edge from the hops. Not assertive - just added for interest and balance. The main game is the malt. [4.5]
August 2015 I now understand how Dandelion & Burdock and Sarsaparilla developed as Temperance Movement substitutes for beer. Thick and malty and gorgeous. A little bit like Old Engine Oil.

Looked great: lovely dark body with a huge tanned head of large bubbles, smooth foaming top to the head.

Dry but malty nose and taste: bitterness comes through from the start. Mild burnt feel to the flavour, but not overpowering. Dark chocolate and young Port came to mind mid-tasting, very nice!

Really impressed: full of interesting flavours and although my palate is on the sweet side this beer still hit the spot for me.

taste: sweet roasted malt, carob, licorice, cola, biscuits, subtle apple/pear esters, and a touch of diacetyl.

luscious and flavorful with a perfectly delicate balance, everything comes through but nothing has prominence. quite simple, yet wonderfully complex and deep. the yeast strain seems to contribute greatly to the mouthfeel and the complexity and the balance.

this beer on cask, or very lightly carbonated and pushed through a stout faucet would be outstanding, maybe even with a bit of licorice root tossed in the cask.","Sanford, Florida, USA","SanfordBrewer"

M: Smooth with a medium carbonation that makes it lively and crisp for style.  Medium-to-heavy body.

4315,"2012-05-31",3.4,"I was a bit surprised by this beer.  It comes in a dark brown bottle and its an ale.  So I was expecting a copper color or brown.  This beer is dark... I mean really dark.  So I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  It is a very nice dark beer with more of a porter taste than an ale.  Definitely worth a try.","Michigan, USA","fsquirrel29"
4315,"2012-04-24",4.0,"Appearance: dark browns under a mousse-like tan head which slowly fades into a thin layer. Smoky embers along the bottom when held up to light. Swirls with random tan spots and a dense creamy head.

Nose: creamy. Chocolate Oreo cookies. Milky. Chocolate cake. Chocolate malt with a whisper of dark fruits mixed in  raisins and prunes. Pumpernickel bread.

Palate: creamy  like a chocolate cloud melting in my mouth with milky Oreo cream delights. Prunes and raisins covered in chocolate brownies. Chocolate malt. Faint tingle of black fruit tartness along the edges  plum skins. Glides across tastebuds like silk. Milk chocolate in the breath.

Final Thoughts: yum!! Truly a delight of all the senses, from sight to smell to sound to mouthfeel to taste to finish. Another winner from the fine folks at J. W. Lees in Middleton, England. As with all English imports and otherwise, drink as fresh as possible. This is not a beer you want to age so savor now and by more later.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed probably fresh, a few weeks after purchase
The look: Near black body with a medium tan head with medium retention
In long: Nose is a bit roasted, some crusty raisin pie.  Taste has a nuttiness reminiscent of cashews, fresh dates and prunes, dark breakfast grape juice, milk chocolate bar, pie crust, raisins, some caramel.  Mild leafy hops presence that adds a fresh tobacco leafs flavor to the beer but not much bitterness.  Mouthfeek is creamy and fluffy with a carbonation that has a lot of very soft bubbles.  My description seems to indicate a good beer but the truth is that I thought the fruitiness and nuttiness didnt work well together at all, like someone had poured a glass of breakfast dark grape fruit juicy in my a perfectly fine porter.

Definitely malty and sugary, but in a good, mellow way. Virtually no head when poured from my bottle, but fizzy like a soda in sound. I think the ""bitterness"" described in other posts is where they get the chocolate.

Must drink a different porter now for comparison. Strange, but drinkable brew.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
4315,"2007-01-01",3.7,"Bottle, I believe courtesy of HogTownHarry. Black body with a small tan head that fades. Aroma of mild roast, dark fruits, raisins, figs (?)  and muted cocoa or hot chocolate notes.

Alcohol is seemingly non-existent. Interesting, bit heavy on the tastebuds but very interesting.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"

 Thanks to some fellow RateBeerian for sending this beer my way, many moons ago! 
 Beer pours a dark shade brown, nearly black, with edges of crimson. The aroma is massively juicy! Dark pit fruits radiate from the depth; plums, fig, dates, plums, apple and pears. There is an enormous chewing tobacco like fruity /spiciness that are blended into a chocolaty experience. This is a very unique experience.

Aroma is rich and savory with good amounts of mineral, some peat, leather, brine, and plum.  Chocolate presents only moderately in the nose.  The flavor is almost exactly as described on the label, which is most unusual.  Strong notes of tobacco, prune, richly booze soaked raisins.  The alchohol is definitely a pleasant component of this beer, a quality witch the folks at JW Lees seem to have down pat.  Long finish brings the emergence of some floral and fruity hops to balance out the earthy notes of the mid-section.  Medium-full bodied throughout.  Much less sweetness than expected.  Very pleasant beer, but tough to deal with the five dollar price tag.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

Very soft in mouth, a bit of chalkiness but thats nitpicking.  Lots of sweet, mild chocolate winey notes. Really digging in, you find smokey notes, plummy/other dark fruit flavors and more. Understated bitterness at the end takes an edge off the sweetness. Alcohol never tasted only felt:) This is a gorgeous brew, subtle, full of depth and class.

Smelt of roasted grain and molasses, a hint of fruit.

Overall, a great sweet porter that is bold and complex, whose only flaw may be that the different flavors that are thrown at the drinker are unbalanced and haphazard.

Yes it does pour very dark- almost black with ruby-red highlihgts, and no head, low carbonation.  Aroma really doesnt have much chocolate malt like you would expect in a porter, but rather it is dominated by a strong fruity ester profile- plums dates and raisins.  Since this has been aged for over a year now, it shows some signs of oxidation including a bit of wet paper and cardboard in the aroma which mix well with the fruits.  Falvor is fruity as well, with some thick caramel malts anda slight nutty, smokey and even some medicinal characteristics.  Body is medium, but seems a bit weak as it warms but finishes relatively smooth.  Pretty good I guess for a ""strong porter"" yet not anywhere near a baltic porter for sure.

This was one that I had to choke down for the first few ounces, then it came to me.  Beer becomes much more drinkable the more it is consumed, however it is initially way too sweet.

But unfortunately, Manchester Star comes off as sugary and fruity sweet rather than malty sweet.  Loads of dark fruits like raisins and prunes, some processed molasses, but the mild roast and bitterness is almost totally shoved in the dark closet by the sweetness, and if not for the smokiness in the finish, this would be a one-dimensional beer if ever there were one.  But personally, if a beer had to be one dimensional, sweet is preferable to many other things, but I still crave some balance here.  Likewise, the nose is all dark, sweet fruit, a bit earthy perhaps.  Medium bodied and gently carbonated, but without anything to balance the beer, its on the cloying side.  Dark brown in color with some transparency at the edges.  The quarter-inch layer of light-tan head dissipates fully in about 15 to 20 seconds.  Lacing is non-existent, obviously.  Needs more of something -- more roast, some hops, a touch of sourness -- to give it balance, but I still find this quite enjoyable.

Enough with the poetry. I absolutley love this beer. I am usually a nut for porters and this is spot on. The dark-reddish hue that seems to entrance the imbiber. Winey notes of caramel apple and minerals spiral into a smoky english malt body. Just enough hops on to bitter and work with the judicious carbonation to give a snappy finish.

4315,"2005-09-08",4.3,"Mahogany tinted chestnut. Quickly fleeting tan bubbles settle to a foamy collar. Saliva inducing nose of toffee pudding drizzled with caramel and topped with dates. Touch of nougat, prunes, and black licorice. Softly carbonated. Early cheek-buckling flash of dried plum acidity is cushioned by an extremely soft flavor profile of figs and fruitcake. Slight char tease is negated by  rich nougat and taffy-dipped prunes, which impart more chewiness. Short-lived soggy fruitiness lessens some of the richness, but is soon lifted by a mid-burst of airiness/plastic, black pepper, and bittersweet chocolate. Quite wet, but sufficiently full. Immensely complex, with an imperceptible alcohol presence, to boot. Derives its complexity from a remarkably unique yeast character, as theres very little emphasis on roast, and merely a pinch of chalkiness. Sweetness heightens at the finish, as a hard mineral underlay harmonizes with ghostlike whispers of toffee pudding, meaty blackstrap molasses, port, and burnt sugar. Could stand to be less sweet and plasticy, but the alcohol is well masked, the yeast character fits like a glove, and the aroma is out of this world. One of the most characterful Porters in existence. Period.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Taste is a thick, toffee and chocolate homage to sweet malt with hints of espresso, raisins, currants, prunes, dates, chocolate, and licorice.  Mouthfeel is luxuriously chewy and creamy.

The aroma is unique for a porter, lots of tobacco notes and strange lambic like yeast twang. Oh there is the roasted malts, plum fruit esters, and some nutty nature. The taste starts equally unique with a streak of tangy and ripened fruits on top of some aged powerful malt expression.  Wow, I get a hint of earthy funk on the finish, almost vinous. The feel is thin but I think that was done for a reason to increase drinkablity, still a touch sticky after all is said and done. Bravo old school, different for most and that is a good thing.

Tremendously filtered and clear as Ive come to expect from Lees. Light tan head is initially large, but recedes, slowly, to a small covering. Aroma of lipsmacking caramel and toffee, light fudge notes, honeycream, low-bitterness roast, musty, old yeast and some dryish milk chocolate notes. Flavor begins with coffee and salty woodsmoke. Chewy chocolate, vanilla-buttercream and a touch of anise. Finishes with a moderate amount of roastiness, quite a bit of sweet malt and not as much yeast as the nose would have it. Body is medium at best, though for a traditional English porter, (which it isnt) this would be ok. For what it is, I do think its too light of body for all of the wonderful promises it makes on the label, not to mention the 7+ abv.

Right after pouring this beer in my office and heading downstairs to watch the tip-off of the WVU vs Louisville game in the NCAA 2005 Elite Eight, I slipped on the top step of the landing and my butt pounded all twelve steps on the way down to the foyer.

My butt will be bruised for weeks. Ended up with glass in hand and held totally upright... thank God! Watching the beer drip down the wall, I can tell that this is an extemely dark porter.
