The peak of the head is awesome with big bublles and creaminess that makes you want to let your lips sleep on it. The lacing is great. As that huge head falls it coats the whole glass, like a film falling all the way to the body.

Minor dark fruit. Flavor is surprisingly hoppy to start (peppers), but a malty base does well to temper and balance. Dry caramel. Tea bitters. Old Ale leanings.

1418,"2010-02-07",4.0,"I received this bottle as an extra from leftmindedrighty, thanks! I think this must be about a year old at this point. I poured it into a standard pint glass (was I supposed to use a pilsener?). The color was a murky brown, not a color I usually see in my ales. The smell was faint (my sense of smell sucks) but malty. The taste was a little sweet but that did not affect drinkability. The alcohol was unnoticeable. I was expecting to get some sort of banana or clove taste but I didnt. I would definitely buy this if given the chance. Another victory for my taste!

Hid alcohol fairly well. Tons of flavor and quite complex. My review doesn’t do it justice, because it’s not a style I’m familiar enough with.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, medium to dark brownish red amber (like a darkened penny) with great carbonation and an average-sized, creamy, off-white head that left mostly diminished but left good to fair lacing. The aroma was grain, toasted and caramel malts, moderate herbal, resin and spicy hops and sort of a smokiness.
The initial flavor was moderate to heavily sweet and lightly acidic; while the finish was moderate to heavily sweet, heavily bitter, and sour with a long duration. There was caramel, smoke, roasted malt and then some resin hops. The medium body was syrupy then dry with fizzy carbonation and a light to moderate astringent and very metallic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

Leaves a bitter lingering finish, like any other IPA, in your mouth. Way too many IPA characters for this pale lager lover. Generally, I really like alts but this stuff is over the top in hops.  For the style, cannot hold a candle to other alts like 	Schell Schmaltzs Alt, Erie Brewing Heritage Alt, Southampton Secret Ale, Penn Alt er Ego or even John Harvard’s Alt Bier.

Softly toasty and caramelly with loads of sweet maltiness.  There is a nice light bit of earthiness.  Warming brings up some light fruitiness as well on top of the noble hoppiness.  The beer is quite nice, but the hops seems a little bit faded in this particular bottle.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1418,"2008-06-11",3.3,"Pours clear brown/amber with a thick tan head. Nice creamy, malty aroma but a little weak. Flavor starts with caramel malt and hops then finishes with some alcohol and an unpleasant herbal/hop note.  Not a favorite from Victory but still interesting.","Maryland, USA","Vas19"

1418,"2008-05-26",4.0,"I did not realize this was getting released again. Wahoo!! This beer is beautiful. Deep reddish brown hues with a strong, thick, creamy beige head that leaves nice lacing. Smells a bit weird, with some sulfur and sewage notes, but mostly its a hop bomb in the nose with citric, piney and floral notes. Some sweet caramel and chocolate undertones hide in there as well. Super smooth and creamy taste. Very complex and hoppy, but enough subtle malts to balance it all out. A little bit of cardboard is my only complaint. Caramel, cocoa, butterscotch, pine, orange and loads more.

Toasty malty taste with caramel and notes of liquorice, even a very subtle (berry-)fruity tail is detectable; quite dry and bitter, toasty and herbal hoppy finish with a noticeable alcoholic note.

1418,"2008-01-23",3.8,"Special thanks to ilovedarkbeer for this underated retired brew. Marked to ""enjoy by Aug 01 06."" My first expiriance with Altbier. Aroma is heavy bready malts with an undertone of spicy orange hops and dried fruits. Appearence includes some of the best lacing I have seen in a while, truly excellent. Head is a largish tan with good retention. Body is a hazy amber-orange ala oktoberfest style brews. Taste over the long duration ends bitter and slightly metallicy in the aftertaste (a product of being bottle aged?). Medium body with a creamy texture and lively carbonation. I feel that it is missing some sort of boldness in the finish, but that could be due to my lack of familiarity with this type of beer. Very good, and underrated in my opinion.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

1418,"2008-01-01",3.3,"Feb. 2006 on draft at Victorys brewpub - I didnt get much of what others wrote in their reviews...and this was my FIRST beer of the night. Anyway, hazelnut crystal clear color with smallish head. Very faint aroma which was pretty nondescript. The flavor was odd. I wouldnt describe it as strong flavored, yet at the same time, Id say it was too sweet and too bitter at the same time. The mouthfeel was really carbonated...too much so for my liking and rather thin. Hops were present, but did more to bitter than to flavor. This was rather disappointing.","Middletown, Delaware, USA","Goodgrief"

1418,"2007-11-15",3.6,"11/15/2007:  Victory Ten Years Alt pours a murky/dirty, tawny amber-brown color that appears to be almost golden brown around the edges.  The small beige head fades away farily quickly and leaves a frothy veil on the surface.  The aroma contains sweet caramelized sugar and malt, aged fruits (roasted apples), some distant maple, and a touch of bitter hops.  The flavor is earthy and bitter.  There the same sweet caramelized maltiness in the middle that gives way to a smooth, and somewhat lengthy finish.  The spicy and bitter hops are really noticeable in the finish as they impart a lasting floral and herbal bitterness and flavor.  This bitterness also lends a nice balance to the sweetness of this beer.  A bit of alcohol is detectable and seems to grow as the beer warms (some dry apple flavors and oxidation also becomes notable).  It is still quite reserved for the 8.5% ABV that is supposedly tucked away in this brew!  The mouthfeel is quite thick and chewy, but fits well with my preferences for this style.  Overall this is a pretty good example of an Altbier that met my expectations.

Altbiere are meant to be consumed extremely fresh, and while this is a few months past its prime, Im happy just to get my hands on the bottle (Thanks, Jason).  Aroma is sweet and malty, light yeast with brown sugar, toasted caramel with light hops.  Amber body with light carbonation and a short soapy tan head.  Taste is very dry, earthy, slightly astringent, darkly malty and lightly bitter with a nice hop-yeast combination.  Somewhat metallic alcohol is too far up front.  Faint dark fruitiness and biscuity malt.  Oxidized a touch.  Light spiciness.  Medium body with a relatively pleasant mf.  Aftertaste (in what should be a perfect session beer) is ruined slightly by the booziness.    Style concerns aside, this is still enjoyable as of late May 2007. [May 26 2007: 6-4-7-3-14]
Another one of these in a trade.  Bottle, best by May 07, here in June 2010.  Cloudy brown with light red highlights, still has good carbonation, soapy beige head.  Sweet malty nose seems to have a hint of what I call the spaghetti funk.  A little roast and perhaps even some smoke.  Strong bitterness, a little alcohol and band-aid astringency.  Airy, very mild oxidation but still holding up relatively well.  Dark, earthy, maybe some plum and pitted fruit, but the surprise here is the dark, charred, burned notes, and the lasting and relatively high level of bitterness.  Sticky malts.  Medium-full body.

Extremely malty nose, some kind of diet (corn) flakes, caramel; and all of it very intense, on the verge of astrigent (or at least its nasal counterpart). Malt syrup. Oxydized malts... cant find a BBD... Again a sweet, grain-derived syrup as malt- or cornsyrup. But with discernible oxydation. Theres no hops imprint, even when the overall flavour certainly isnt as sweet as the ""syrup"" would impose on itself. Quite sweet anyhow. Ends a bit leafy, earthy, nutty. Slight, portwine-like viscosity: medium bodied at least. Dont understand about the oxydation.

There is a lingering earthy malt that sticks around as well as traces of abv.  Very nicely done.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

1418,"2006-12-11",3.4,"Despite being close to the expiration date, this beer has kept a hefty dose of hop aromas, translating into a potent leafy, laurel, old socks and earthy perfumes (better than it sounds!). Kinda tea like within its slightly citrusy (orange) boundaries. Nevertheless, the hops maintain more of a bittering than aromatic function, letting rather sweet berries and figs fruitiness shine through its rather toasty foundations. Surprisingly lean bodied, easily drinkable for that magnitude and the alcohol is a no-show. Pretty good.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Bready and appley with a touch of raisin sweetness in the nose.  Medium bodied and super dry.  Medium malt roast and a great woody, earthy bitter chocolate malt charavter.  Lively and tingling.  But texturally layered and sophisticated.  Sweet malts, Tart flavors that meld into bitter and dry hoppy finish.  It hits all aspects of the tongue.  Caramel malts, as said before, bittersweet chocolate, a well hidden alcohol burn that becomes more apparent as the beer warms and the other flavors and palate subside.  Nice musty note as the glass is raised to my lips, and in the mouth for just a split second.  Quickly raplaced by the dry, hoppy monster that is spicy and has a subtle grassy flavor and aroma.  The finish leaves the mouth sticky but somewhat puckered.  The dryness is counteracted by the sticky piney, resinous hop profile.  If this is an alt bier, I love alt biers!

-A veil of foam garnishes the murky copper.
-Cheesy hops and strawberry sweetness intrigue the nostrils.
-Candied fruitiness and noble herbal hops keep the tongue interested throughout.
-The low carbonation and well-nourished maltiness produce a comfortable mouthfeel.

What if you dig deeper?
-Herbal hops healthily linger.
-Raspberries expand the fruity spectrum.
-The alt heritage is still felt even though its been pushed into doppel sticke territory.
-Alcohol is no obstacle for this well-crafted sipper.

1418,"2006-08-02",4.6,"I have had this beer several times now. I had it on-tap Friday night at the Victory party, On-tap Saturday night at the victory party and from the wooden barrel. I am now having it in the bottle and it is just as good. In fact I enjoyed it even more at home. I didnt take notes previously so I do not know if it really is better in the bottle or just the fact that there are less enthusiastic distractions in my home; and the relaxed experience allows me to focus on the beer better at home. Nonetheless, those of you who had this beer at the party, do not fear that youll get something less in the bottle. I did worry it wouldnt be as good, and it is great!

I my opinion this beer has absolutely no faults whatsoever. It is an instant favorite of mine.

Appearance: It is a dark amber color that is pretty much transparent (very enticing just by appearance). A nice whit head and decent lacing. 

Smell: This beer portrays a big but gentle sweet malt aroma. It smells of caramel, brown sugar, birch or cherry wood, a sprinkle of spices and a hint of brandy.

Taste: The flavor is dominantly a brown sugar sweet malt. It also featured caramel, a hint of molasses, a dash of pepper and just a hint of cherry and apple. I know this beer was not aged in a wooden barrel, (I had that version at Victorys party) but it still seemed to have a hint of that wood flavor like in a Woodford Reserve Bourbon. As a huge fan of Bourbon and Brandy all I could think of was my dream come true, a whiskey beer. That does not mean you could taste the alcohol. The 8.50% ABV was completely masked; buried so deep that you would never imagine it was more than 5% until you finish the second one and realize it :)
The hop character is firmly yet discretely present. The floral hops show them self only through mild spices and grannysmith apple or lime peel presence found alongside the pepper flavor. Not overly green just enough to keep it nice and crisp. What a perfectly balanced flavor. Excellent!

Mouthfeel: It is smooth and slick at the beginning and the end with a hint of peppery crispness just before the swallow.

Drinkability: I can drink this till I fall over! Wow. I am flabbergasted. It is so smooth an yet crisp; sweet yet bitter, it is IMO, everything a beer should be!
What else can I say. It is an absolute must have. Try it and see what you think!

Hope this is helpful.

Aromas are sweet, malty and caramel... almost a bit syrupy with some fruit in the mix, too.  The flavor is really different than I was expecting.  The syrupy character comes through and it almost starts like a barley wine or something, but then does a head fake and things get a little funky as it settles into a bitter hop finish that could be a bit more smoothly transitioned, but I like it.  It does have a bit of an astringent alcoholic character that is a bit much at times, but then considering the ABV its really to be expected.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

Because the aroma almost reminded me of a bock, I expected the flavor to be dominated by malt but it was much more balanced with a solid hop presence, some toffee, floral notes and a little vanilla.  I thought the mouthfeel was a tad watery but the finish was both sweet and pleasantly bitter.

Aroma is caramel malt, fruit, earthy notes and a slightly Barelywine-like aroma that is hoppier than expected. Pour is amber/brown with a firm pinky thin tan head that diminished slowly. Rich, sweet caramel explodes int he fore and carries on through the middle and finish. A dollop of toffee appears through the middle ranges and the whole thing is expertly supervised by a consistent, but never domineering hops flavor. Some mild fruit and bread notes are present in the far finish. Seems pretty big for an Alt (or the ones I have had) but as a beer and it is fairly tasty.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"

1418,"2006-06-11",3.3,"Poured a clear dark copper color with a decent initial off-white, fluffy head, that laced decently. Aroma was hard to pick up at a serving temp of 50C, only citrus and light caramel. The flavor was strong, lots of caramel and light toffee. Roastedness was underplayed. Balanced by a significant amount of hops. Claims to have only German hops in it, but there was definitely a citrus twist to the hop flavor. Hot alcohol presence for an alt. An alt with extreme maltiness and hoppiness, much like a dIPA take on the alt style. This was clearly an ale and did not come across with any lager crisp/cleanness. Finish wasnt really dry enough for my liking on the alt style. Hard to rate within style, because Im most familiar with and very fond of the standard alts. This ""sticke"" was much like the Uerige Doppelsticke Ive had, which is a rare style even in the Dusseldorf area. How to compare this to a bottle of the Uerige that travelled over the Atlantic? Not bad, but sticky sweet and somewhat cloying, despite the hoppiness.","","User37895"

This beer proudly displays a tall, off-white chapeau on a cloudy, deep amber body.  Emanating from the glass is a fruity, mildly sweet, grainy and caramely aroma that is less pleasing that I was expecting because it is also has a dirty-laundry aroma.  Whatever short-comings I find in the nose, they are erased when I take a sip of this wonderfully flavorful beer.  Actually, the first thing I notice on my initial sip is the exceptional, full-bodied mouthfeel.  Wow, this is almost chewy!  The flavor is very malty, toasty, and quite hoppy and bitter, nothing shy about it.  The toasty malts turn a bit bready in the finish.  Hops are more European in style rather than the citrusy type Im used to out here.  The head gradually settles to a wide ring, but leaves large pathes of lace that resemble ice crystals on the window on a cold winters day.

It has such delectable sweetness and gentle caramels. Lightly toasted grains with sweet lemon thyme and basil stems. Good chewiness. Theres a touch of toast and some aged wheat with a spot of light yeast spice.

Hazed stuff, ruby-copper colored with glowing amber highlights.  the head is small but lasting in a tan film.  Aroma is encouraging with a round mixture of earth (mineral, wet grain field), spice (black pepper), and fruit.  The hops are potent enough that they mask any trace of the high ABV.  The flavor is exciting as it fills the mouth and returns strongly in the retronasal -- slightly boozy, reminding of mildly rummy raisins or prunes when theyre quite young and juicy, not bitter hops but earthy, and ever present, and richly endowed with delicious and toasty malts.  Creamy and full mouthfeel is outstanding and carbonation seems perfectly done with only the slightest tingle at the back of the tongue, complimenting the wonderful finish of lingering pepper, mineral, and toasty barley.

Aroma is what Id call tall and slim. Lovely whole grain bready aroma thats fresh and reaching with a slight nutty dryness, a slim sweet fruityness and a dusting of chocolate.

Taste is well blended and balanced with malts bringing lightly dry bread tones floating off the middle from its sweetish start. From midway to the finish this is all unquitting flavors on the palate. Great bready grains and caramel with very adequately balanced floral hoppyness and dry leafyness. Finds time to squeeze in some fruits just before the swallow. Very intriguing and complex. Lengthy too. One of the higher qualities that I liked about it was that it lasted on the buds and begged for more as it did. Nice!

Feel is just a notch above medium. Fairly filling, yet smooth and succulant with a well rounded appeal thats quite quenchable. Mostly detained from the middle and into the finish where it almost seemed to gain more and more control and attention. Solid carbonation. The hops begin to find their home after a while. And there where and when they find it, which is sooner than later, its dry, grassy, floral, and nutty. Fantastic.

A wonderfully balanced beer with lots of flavor packed fun. It grows on ya might quick and is gone just as so. And 8.5%, please...where it is, is probably a couple more later when youve nearly drained em as fast as youve poured em.

Refreshing hoppy aroma of mandarin orange peel, complimented by a sweet brown sugar and caramel maltiness.  Body is relatively thin, but the sugary sultriness from the nose comes through cleanly and pleasantly on the palate.  Immediately following is a crisp blue spruce bite of hops, giving it a rather pleasant tongue scrubbing finish.  Final smack has a bit of an alcoholic bite that resembles a dry gin martini.

Lots of tropical fruit in the nose, including notes of pineapple and mango, glazed with some spiced rum and brown sugar.  Hints of coconut and toasted brazil nuts topped on a crispy wheat cake.  Some alcohol warmth noted, but not overly harsh.  Full bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel, softening up the body somewhat, but not contributing much character beyond that.  Slightly oxidized and papery, with a hint of woody cocounut husks.  A restrained caramel and strawberry malt flavor starts to come through, heavy and plodding, disguised by dry wood.  Some high alpha white grapefruit hops come out mid-palate, but they dont contribute much other than an intense bitterness that builds into the finish.

Light chill haze to it, with some minor lacing.Nose is surprisingly bursting with fruity hops.  Well, perhaps not bursting, but they are large, round and full of yellow fruit notes.  Plenty of ripe peaches, predominantly, with a light brassy-mineral note of alt yeast, deep toasted grains providing fair depth with no sign of alcohol.  Light poundcake sweetness is quickly curtailed by bitter, dry, tettnang-like soily/hay notes.  Of medium strength is the aroma.The flavor continues the hop trend, with bountiful bitterness wedded to lightly sugary pale malts, with a tastefully done toasted malt, vienna-like huskiness that seems to offset the juicy hops perfectly.  Very impressed with the abundance of hop flavors and bitterness without any suggestion of PNW.  Good for them.  Fairly nominal texture, with mostly tight carbonation, perhaps a little too expansive at times, but deep enough malts, peachy-fruits from the hops, hay, sweat and grass as well, and no sign of alcohol in the flavor.  Darkens, with more sign of the roasted malts, as it warms, but nothing to get worried about.

Beady vellum lacing slowly cascades down the glass as we go.  Aroma is ignited with cherry toffee, maple beachwood, copper accents, spicy peppery touches, amaretto coffee creamer and honey nectar.  Such a rare, unique display of aromatic affection.  Flavorful force pushes full stream ahead.  Hoppy sticke accents come to the forefront, dancing with a dry, clean, caramel and chocolate percussion.  Dry, woodsy balsa tendencies, sticking with a piney, cedar sap vibrancy.  Buttery pecans and pralines partner with expressive caramel ribbons.  Clean, dry and bitter, and then an unquenching, unflinching meld of the tongue to the top of the mouth is upon us.  Splices the inner mouths central domain in two.  Quite a hoppy alt creation, but a priceless introduction and foray by an American craft brewery into the world of alts.  Bitterness crests on the arc at the back of the throat in the finish, along with some cedar resin and peppered toffee cubes with a maple liquor heart.

1418,"2006-03-17",3.5,"Bottle bought in Michigan and served in my GL snifter: Poured a deep sunset orange with a small fuffy head and some cling. The nose detects a grassy and floral hop character, biscuity and husky malt, moderate allspice and strangely lemongrass (?), and some estery vapors. The taste starts with a layer of sweet and bready malts on top the spiced and noble hops are found. The palate seems to detect a lot of veggie character, which made me back-off quickly, but that faded quickly and left a mild bitter and bready aftertaste that is the mark of a classic Alt. In the end, I enjoyed this more when it warmed to me. By far it is hardly a classic example of the genre but seemed to be better as a whole than many I have tried.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Pours a dark bronze body and a downy tan hued head. The aroma is largely malty, multigrain cereal; a clue of maple syrup, and what ploys me to believe, a docile earthy hops. The flavor brings a nice helping of caramel, toffee, a refined nuttiness, hints of coco, plum, some raisins; all backed by a spicy somewhat herbal, bittering hoppynes; hints of pine resin, spruce chips, citrus oils, rosemary. A pretty damn hoppy Alt! All Finishes with a bittersweet conjunction of biscuity malts and raw citric hops finishes dry as a petrified log! Although a slight metallic suggestion lingers in somewhere???? 
 Overall A fine beer practically worthy of a 10 year milestone Victory celebration","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

Flavor is nice and malty as well, rich sweet caramel, roasted malts, cherry, yeast, spice, and some bitter hops on the finish blend with the warmth of the alcohol.

1418,"2006-03-06",3.4,"Pours a brilliantly clear, deep, dark, reddish color that shows ruby notes when held up the  light.  The head is initially one-finger thick, through it quickly disappears and is a light tan color.  The aroma is fruity with a bit of sweet candied cherry note to it.  There is also a light herbal and spice type note here as well as a light toasted malt note, which combines with a sweet caramel malt note.

The beer is full and coating up front, yet is not as sweet as I would expect from a beer of this heft.  An immediate, herbal, almost raw hop note is noticeable up front and continues on into a mouth gripping, solid bitterness.  I was expecting this to have an aggressive hop character like the best Alts I have had, which it does, but I was hoping for that intense, smooth fruitiness as well, which is not in this beer.  The hops, especially the herbal notes, seem to combine with some alcohols and perhaps some fusels to give this a bit of a harsh note towards the end.  This is pretty tasty, I just wish it were a bit less herbal and aggressive and a bit more balanced.  I have a feeling though, that this will mellow and become a much more rounded and balanced mix of flavors once it gets a couple months more of age.  Or perhaps it is just that I am haunted by the wonderful memories of tasting fresh Ale in Düsseldorf.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Spicy whiff of alcohol and fruitiness. Lush, fluffy carbonation. Opens thoroughly rich with soft malt flavors, yet with an off medicinal astringency coupled with some harshly earthy malt derivatives. Assertively grassy hops arouse the senses with a sassy bitterness while a flurry of alcoholic warmth clams the soul. Dense pockets of juicy resins are sandwiched within the predominantly herbal hop character, but manage to withstand the substantially arid body. Malts become less rigid and much more refined as things progress, gaining a supple toffee sweetness kissed lightly with starfruit. Steadily firm on into the finish, as woody malts mesh effortlessly to create a harmoniously dry fusion of alcohol and anise. Alcohol is a bit too forward in both flavor and aroma and theres some unpleasant medicinal astringency, early on. Needs some (more?) Pilsner malt depth to soften things.

1418,"2006-02-21",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 26, 2006 Copper/amber color, with a light tan head. Aromas are fruit, malt, hops, and a touch of spice. Flavors are malt, hops, fruit, nuts, and spice. A bit bitter towards the end, and more hoppy than I thought it would be. Itd rather good now, but aging may take the edge off of the bitterness.","Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA","zathrus13"
1418,"2006-02-21",4.2,"Deep copper colored with ruby hints, this one has a medium off-white head.  The aroma was fruity and caramel malty, with some hops and nuts.  The flavor is malty, nutty, and fruity, with a big hop presence.  Probably the hoppiest alt Ive had.  This one remains balanced and interesting as it warms up.  I bought a sixer to go, and just might go back for a jeroboam.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
1418,"2006-02-20",3.2,"Congratulations to Victory for reaching the 10 year mark. This one pours a medium brown color with a white head. Malty aroma with notes of toffee and caramel. What would be a perfectly nice malty german style beer is sort of messed up with a strangely bitter finish. A decent effort but not exactly this best beer ever.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","Magjayran"
1418,"2006-02-20",3.6,"Pours a medium amber, mostly clear, and a thin white head that fades.  Aroma isnt nearly as powerful as I thought it would be compared to uerige.   Good amount of munich malts but not powerful enough somehow.  The flavor was nice and malty, a bit too light and crisp, but had a nice hoppiness in the end and a good bitterness.  Body was a bit too weak especially compared to uerige doppelsticke.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
1418,"2006-02-19",3.8,"Malty. Slightly sweet. Almost barley wine style. Not yet there. But another quality brew from Victory.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
1418,"2006-02-18",3.9,"On tap at the Victory 10 Year Anniversary party.  Pours a reddish, brown slightly hazy amber with an average tan lacing head.  Aroma of roasty caramel malts, dark fruits, smoke, light alcohol and bread.  Flavors of the same with a light hop bitterness.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
1418,"2006-02-18",3.9,"On tap at Victory. Poured a deep brownish color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of caramel, fruity, light alcohol, roasted malts and light spices. Tastes of caramel, raisins, fruity and spices. Light alcohol finish.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
1418,"2006-02-18",4.3,"Pours a clear, dark copper/orange. Light copper head of tiny bubbles diminishes quickly. Lots of dense, sticky lacing. Aromas of caramel, light fruit, honey, spices and alcohol. Flavor of fruits, malt, caramel followed by moderate hops and spice. This is a very well balanced brew. Mouthfeel is moderately creamy and slightly oily with moderate carbonation. Just an outstanding beer and an impressive domestic example of the style.","Michigan, USA","HomesickAlien"
1418,"2006-02-17",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 6, 2006 [Gravity Oak Cask] Poured a dark amber / chestnut color with a medium sized, light tan head.  Aroma of caramel malt, citrus fruits, toffee, light spices, and some alcohol as well.  Taste of roasted malt, caramel, light chocolate, some citrus fruits, vanilla, light smoke, and a medium bitterness in the finish.  Creamy mouthfeel.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
1418,"2006-02-17",4.7,"Outstanding domestic example of sticke bier, which is a brawnier version of Dusseldorf altbier. 10 years of Victory, and a wonderful beer to celebrate that milstone with. Its hard to find a good example of alt, let alone sticke outside of Dusseldorf, but Im happy to say Victory has got this one right. Ten Years Alt pours to a beautiful, bright, deep copper color, with a thick, white head that fades, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose is excellent with snappy and zesty herbal hop aroma, that leads into a slighty slick, nutty/sweet malty and fruity palate. This beer is very polished, round, and smooth on the tongue. Ten Years Alt finishes with more good smooth malt and fruit up front, then ends with a snappy burst of herbal/grassy hop bittereness that lingers. Stylistically, a very accurate example of sticke, and this beer joins the ranks of the few impressive, domestic examples of the style. Great beer, well worth seeking out.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"
1418,"2006-02-15",3.2,"Pours a very clear amber, with a fizzy tan head that fizzles out fast. Nose is faint and malty with subtle hop notes. Flavor is rich and malty, but not too sweet. A nice dry finish with some bitterness.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TheBeerNinja"
