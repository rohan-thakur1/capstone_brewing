Wow, the Pinot Noir works very well in the nose with the floral aromas of fresh grass and spices. Hints of wood as well. The taste has the hops at first, but balanced with vanilla notes from the oak.

hazy orange color. white head. Sticky head and lacing. 
Nose is red wine, oak, yeast, some funk, apple, and pear. Barrel has really taken over. 
taste is dominated by the barrel. Wine and oak. Lots of bugs. Very funky, apple and pear. Soft bitterness.

Red wine permeates a grapefruit and orange hop flavor. The hops are not bright, as you would imagine. A little bit of sweetness with oak and bitterness. Red wine lingers in the aftertaste. Low carbonation. Tastes pretty good, but it might be a struggle to drink a whole bottle.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

960,"2016-06-03",4.2,"Miam !
Nez hyper frais, légèrement vineux, très porté sur le raisin frais, un faux air de lambic. Notes très poivrées.
Bouche : ultra équilibrée, plutôt légère sans être aqueuse, fine, très agréable ! Le vineux se ressent mais on partirait finalement presque sur un riesling et un côté relativement sec. Un fond vert subsiste mais on perd le caractère houblonné. Vinaigre très légèrement perceptible, juste ce quil faut pour redonner de la pêche, un peu de fraîcheur, un fond acide. Quelques notes agrumes. Un superbe panorama floral.
Finale a priori sèche mais longueur très douce et fruitée.

960,"2016-04-10",3.6,"Bouteille de 341 mL, version 2015

Couleur : Belle robe dorée, mince couche de mousse indiquant une faible carbonatation, et faible effervescence.

Arôme : Sent laspect vineux et vinaigré du vieillissement en barriques de vin rouge, les levures sauvages et le sucre.

Goût : Ce qui me frappe demblée, cest principalement les levures sauvages, et laspect vinaigré du vin rouge, assez fidèle à larôme en fait. Un peu de sucre en arrière-plan.

Appréciation: Je dois admettre que je mattendais à quelque chose de différent. On retrouve très peu la Dernière Volonté originale. Cest loin dêtre mauvais, pas du tout, mais une version vieillie en fût dune bière devrait, selon moi, être une extension de la bière originale, au lieu dêtre quelque chose de complètement différent.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","LouisP"

960,"2015-06-11",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2015 Bière revisitée en compagnie de Ju-Lo au brewpub. Cheers man! Cette bière a, à mon avis, deux qualités que je me dois de souligner. La première est sa majestueuse beauté. La bière dans mon ballon ressemble à une grosse pêche à la tête mousseuse, blanche et collante. Le liquide est orangé et semble lourd dans mon verre lorsque je le fais tournoyer. De longues jambes collantes restent accrochées sur le verre et la mousse y reste également accrochée. Vraiment un look sublime! La deuxième grande qualité de cette bière réside dans le temps de maturation en fût. En effet, je redoutais fortement un liquide lourdement boisé, acide (dû au chêne) et vineux mais ce nétait nullement le cas. Ce vieillissement en barrique de pinot est dune grande subtilité. Est-ce attribuable à une courte période de maturation, ou alors à des fûts ayant servi plus dune fois à y faire vieillir de la bière? Il faudrait interroger le brasseur à ce sujet, mais toujours est-il que mes papilles ont été préservées! Pour le reste, bel agaençement de houblons légers et de malts à peine sucrés sans être secs.

Aroma is sort of lambic-esque,with vinous red wine and butterscotchy oak. Hazy dark yellow under an epemeral thin, white cover. Smooth, sweet base malt flavour that seems delicate yet not overpowered by the oak and wine accents that are clearly present. A well balanced beer that makes excellent use of the wine barrel to highlight the balt and Belgian yeast characteristics of the fermentation.

Strong oak, berries (substituting in strawberry), honey. Apricot, straw, dull pepper. The aroma lacks power but has some delicate qualities. Flappy mouth thing of wonder: sweet berries, misplaced yet acceptable sourness, apricot, dryness, belg yeast, pepper is more obvious in taste than in snort but still subdued. Lemony tartness, light funk I think. Ok mouthfeel - its all over the place so I guess that is cool. My only honest sips for pure enjoyment only half intrigue me.

How: Bottle 341ml.  A few times.  This rating for a bottle consumed about 6 months after the beer release
The look: Cloudy golden-blonde body topped by a small off-white head
In long: Nose of fruit salad and wood shop.  Taste is a two phases thing.  First is a sweet fruity attack with white grapes and a lot of dried light color fruits.  And then a strong wood dryness take over.  Very woody.  The wood here has a woodshop (like 2x4 construction wood) character.  A little sawdust in the finish.  Alcohol is not well hidden and feels more than 7.5%.  None of the mega-aromatic hops of the regular version.  This beer is aged in wine barrels but I did not find it vinous at all.  Not even juicy.  Some grapes flavour maybe, but thats it.  This is totally different from the regular Dernière Volonté.  I much prefer the regular version but this barrel aged version is so different that it does not feel like a bad Dernière Volonté.  Its just a nice beer on its own.

960,"2010-05-20",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 1, 2016 My Bottom Line:
Wooden greenness, distinct vinosity, grape fruitiness and herbal hop bitterness merge in this personable Barrel-Aged Belgian-style Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A circle of foam laces around the misty golden.
-The barrel presence is quite forceful in the aroma and finish.
-The grape character is a perfect match to this beers esters.
-At this point (a few months after its initial release), the hops are overshadowed by the wine barrel, which is a shame, imho.
-Carbonation could be higher and/or more airy to help make the texture more comfortable.
-I much prefer the regular Dernière Volonté, but I appreciate the experience of these barrel-aged batches greatly.

Someone mentioned some diacetyl, a little wood in the nose too.  Flavor is sweet, cheesy, tart, flowers, light lemons, white grapes.  The barrel is definitely absent in the flavor.

960,"2010-01-29",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2016 Bottle: Poured a dirty beige color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of Belgian malt with some dry hops and some easily detectable vinous notes. Taste is also a well balanced mix between some vinous notes with dry hops and typical Belgian pale malt. Body is quite full with great carbonation and no signs of the alcohol. Very well done though more tart notes à la  Russian River would have provided more complexity which would have been interesting.

2016 ratings. 6 months old bottle shows more complexity and the pinot notes are very well integrated. Lots of complexity and great balance overall.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
960,"2010-01-27",3.5,"341 ml bottle via Lubiere (merci!), served almost cold in a tulip glass. 
App.:  Cloudy orange-golden with a modest white head.
  
Aroma:  Certainly different than the original, the initial aroma is slightly vinous and funky tartness, still some leafy hops, but certainly much less, some nice sweet honey and malts, slight esters, certainly lemony, an odd and ephemeral cigar ash aroma, apricot fruitiness, almost a peppery quality; certainly interesting.
  
Palate:  Medium body, fairly sparse effervescence.
  
Flav.:  A nice resinous/pine hope presence, there is certainly a vinous, oaky quality to the beer, the malts are more subdued, the malt/ester fruitiness is nearly gone, replaced by tart wine fruit, some yeast notes; dry with a touch of brightness and fairly solid bitterness, leaving a biscuity malt finish. 

This is definitely an interesting experience.  I was pretty happy with the normal DV, and I dont think that this one tops it.","Nepean, Ontario, CANADA","probstblueribbon"
960,"2010-01-21",3.5,"Pours a cloudy golden color with a thin white head. Solid aroma of yeast, honey, wood, raisins and alcohol, theres not much of a hops aroma. There a warm presence of alcohol in the flavor along some wood, raisins and honey, again, the hops are discreet. The body is light to medium with a slightly vinous texture and gentle carbonation. This is definitely an interesting experiment, but I prefer the original to this version.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
960,"2010-01-19",4.7,"Tried a first bottle in St-Jérôme and it was such a velvety, smooth and overall delightful version of that brew I already love that I bought 6 bottles to go, as much as they allowed me to buy...  The white wine flavors are obvious and in perfect harmony.  Another enchanting brew from that beer-wizard.  And, and, and, the employees told me theres an oak-aged Solstice dhiver presently aging and that will soon be available.  Keep up the oak-aging attemps, you magical brewer of my dreams!","Terrebonne, Quebec, CANADA","bedainedebiere"

Despite what the label says, the ABV is 7.5% as per JF Gravel of DDC.

Im kind of excited as this is my first local barrel-aged beer.

Poured from a 341ml. bottle.

Appearance: A slightly clear, gold body fills the glass that gets decidedly hazier as i pour the last of the bottle and the yeast mixs in. A thick and insistent head that gradually receds leaving lots of lacing. A good start for sure.

Smell: Citrus & yeast that come out at first followed by some funk & bubblegum. Bananas & cloves are present as well. At first i dont smell the Pinot but later on i get a whiff of wine. Very nice indeed.

Taste: Im struck as to how the Pinot aspect is quite present in the first sips. Has a slight vinegar edge, not unpleasant, with a dose of funk and an overall dryness to it. Definite wood presence also. Some banana flavor mixed in there as well as a spicy clove finish. Though there is a definite Belgian influence, the Pinot is the prime player here.

Mouthfeel: The best feature of this beer IMO. Very low carbonation which makes this beer just glide in my mouth with effortless ease. Though the Pinot is strong, i find the body quite literally amazing. So very good.

Drinkability: Drinks quite well with an ABV that is not easily perceptible in the taste. Though the strength of the barrel-aged Pinot took me some getting used to, i grew accustomed to it and ended up loving the taste.

Overall: While drinking this beer, i could sense that this was an experiment but i believe that they pulled it off quite well. Too bad not many people will get a chance to try it but worth the effort to acquire IMO.","Carignan, Quebec, CANADA","papat444"
960,"2010-01-10",3.9,"341ml bottle from DDC in St-Jerôme. Pours clear amber with a small head. Head goes away fast A light veil of foam stays on and extensive lacing remains on the glass walls. Nose is yeasty with a light touch of oak and some hints of tartness/funk. Some hints of white grapes also with some alcohol. Taste is yeasty and fruity with hints of barrel. Finish is quite warm with hints of oak and yeast. Light bitterness. Carbonation is rather soft but fizzy. Taste has some hints of white grapes also. Really nice brew. Im glad DDC is starting to do stuff like that even if its only in very small quantities and you have to drive up to St-Jerôme to get some !","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"
960,"2010-01-02",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 19, 2010 Bottle. Nice golden-peach color. Lots of oak age aromas here, lambic-like, something definitely floral, fruit flowers, grapes, fresh butter. Taste is very complex; woody, earthy, some grass and a bit of those winey grapes, light acetic finish. Very nice palate, quite smooth and velvety, rich. Very enjoyable oak-aged beer. 

Rerate: Tried a second bottle and was pretty off with harsh wood and medicinal fruits and herbs.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
