1893,"2010-04-06",3.5,"If I tried this beer in an EPA tasting rather than against RRs big IPAs, it would probably receive higher marks. I adjusted my score a few times, trying to figure out what exactly I was comparing it to. While I wait for my call to judge pale ale competitions, here are my thoughts on this beer. The beer pours a pleasant golden color with an okay head. The nose is malt and grain with some of RRs usual hoppiness, floral and pine, in the background. There is some bitterness in the finish but the taste was sweet fruit, grain and malt. As the style seems to dictate, the hops are toned down, especially compared to RRs big IPAs. The mouthfeel is a bit light, and the beer is easy to drink. While I didnt give it a go, its probably an easier beer to drink for the evening than most at RR.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

The aroma here is very light, a touch of caramel/toasted malts, floral type hops if you really search. The flavor is completely unique. I cant decide if its a new English hop, or a wet hop English beer. However, I cant see that happening. The flavor is very similar to a pile of raked autumn leaves... except in a good way... just how horseblanket is used as a good flavor descriptor.

One of the most impressive heads Ive ever seen, this one formed a huge dome puffing out the top of my glass, lasting an incredibly long time thanks to the steady stream of carbonation flowing up from the bottom of the glass.  Aroma of graham cracker malts and lightly sweet caramel, balanced by some herbal, earthy, lotus leaf hops.  Light bodied with a shimmering carbonation to caress the tongue.

Really wish I could talk to him about whats behind it as with the dead leaf in the name I wonder if he wanted a supressed bitterness or if thats just my imnagination running wild. Plenty fine beer to drink on a deck in summer, thats one thing I do know.","austin, Tejas, Texas, USA","fly"
