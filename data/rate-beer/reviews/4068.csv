4068,"2017-04-19",3.6,"Best Before 6.22.17 cans drunk 3/12 and 4/14/17.Large, expansive, foamy white head with surprisingly strong retention, tops a deep golden-brass body with a moderate haziness.The nose is fruity and fairly gentle for the series (and De Proef sours, in general). Lots of pineapple, kiwi and soft nectarine with just an afterthought of lactic acidity. Biscuity, crackery malts behind it are sparse and theres a strong earthy/musty house character leading to more lemon, lime, pineapple and black pepper on the finish. No alcohol or flaw.In the mouth its dry, though amply malted with soft wheat textures, as well. Pretty nicely done on the citra, with no heavy sweat or intense citrus dominance. Not incredibly juicy, but theres some of that here, at least. Sourness is predominantly lactic, quite tart and quenching and not terribly sour, really. Strong carbonation breaks up the body and helps disperse the hop and bacterial acidity. The second can I had, about a month after the first, was decidedly more lactic, with powdered sugar, slight metallic notes and just more overall punch and twang. More of the classic de Proef characteristics that I strongly dislike. First can was near a 4.0 while the second in the lower 3s. Rating is an average.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

4068,"2015-05-25",4.1,"(330ml bottle @ VilleValla Pub, Linköping, May 21 2015) Pours hazed medium gold with small white head and lace. Aroma of sour/tart peach, pear, and unripe mango up front. Citrus along with a bit of grass underneath, making for nice layers. Some light sweaty funk. Very subtle acetic notes. Flavour begins by following the nose, nice and fruity and tart blend of pear, pit fruit, tropical fruit and citrus, but some earthy funky stuff starts to build in the middle. Becomes dry and kind of woody on the aftertaste, almost tannic but not aggressively bitter. Tartness on the finish as well. Pretty full body with fairly high carb. Really like the complexity of hop/fermentation interplay, lots going on, good balance but more than a sour + IPA hops. Top stuff.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"
