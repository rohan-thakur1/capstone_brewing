After warming it pours with a huge foamy head and smells like hazelnut, sugar, molasses and alcohol. The flavor is nutty, and tastes a lot like shiskey. Its a bit rough on the palate. Just because you put beer in a whiskey barrel doesnt mean its going to be better. This really doesnt taste anything like a dunkel.","austin, Texas, USA","kidmartinek"

Pours lightly hazy/cloudy very dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cocoa, chocolate, brown bread, caramel, raisin, light banana, clove, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, brown sugar, and light yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, barrel, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big cocoa, chocolate, brown bread, caramel, raisin, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, clove, brown sugar, light banana, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of cocoa, chocolate, brown bread, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, light clove and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of malt, yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great malt/barrel flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Barrel aged weizenbock. All around great complexity and balance of malt, yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Aroma: This one has a nose of bourbon, banana, some wheat, and chocolate malts (which, for the record, is exactly what I wrote down well before reading the description...)

Appearance: It pours a cloudy brown color, orange hue, small beige head, minimal lace

Flavor: The taste is more banana/wheat/chocolate, bourbon is more subtle than the nose

Palate: Fairly full body, light heat, some stickiness, and good drinkability considering the ABV

Overall Impression:
