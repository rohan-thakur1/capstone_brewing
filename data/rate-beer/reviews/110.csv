110,"2016-05-31",4.3,"Quel nez puissant de biscuit Graham gorgé de miel, de sucre dérable, dépices à tarte aux pommes, de fruit acidulé et de merveille masquée! Et cela se poursuit en bouche avec un fruit qui donne le meilleur des deux mondes: à la fois décadent de sucre et à la fois assez aiguisé.

110,"2013-08-18",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 29, 2015 Multiple times in the past 3 years. Thanks to TheJester for these bottles (375 ml). 

Appearance:  Clear amber/orange with no head and nice legs.  

Aroma: It smells exactly like an apple pie, very impressive. Loads of cinnamon along baked apples, brown sugar and nutmeg. 

Taste: Medium to heavy sweetness with a mild acidity and again the same ""apple pie"" components than in the aroma along with a mild alcohol presence.

Palate: Medium to full body. A bit syrupy. Nice spicy (cinnamon, nutmeg) and alcohol warming finish. Brown sugar and overcooked apples are showing up again a bit at the end. Not too sticky.  

Overall: This is amazing stuff. Absolutely unique and the closest you can get from an apple pie without being an actuel apple pie. Of course, its not super drinkable but itS not cloying either. Tasty. Great luscious cider!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Aroma is incredible, and probably the best cider Ive ever encountered - notes of vanilla spiced apple pie, fresh apple crisp, apple skins, cinnamon, and sugar. Mouthfeel is thick, indulgent and luscious with notes of warm apple cinnamon crisp, butter, vanilla, cinnamon, spice, and a light warming in the finish. Not only one of the best ciders out there, but probably one of the best beverages, hands down, through the ground.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
110,"2012-08-19",4.5,"375mL shared at Campdown Brewdown. Holy monkey. Poured a deeper tea amber. Flat. Thick legs. Unreal nose- like vanilla whipped cream atop mulled cider. Wow. More complexities then I want to list off here- Ill just say 10/10 on the nose. Taste is gorgeous- thick apple pie, oily crust, butter, thick sugar dessert, spicy cinnamon and vanilla mousse. Buttery dessert. Small tannins and acid to balance. Dense but refreshing and bright. Easy masterpiece. So delicious- had everyone dumbfounded at the tasting. An experience.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Poured a nice copper orange liquid, slick and slow on the glass leaves creeping legs. McIntosh skins, dry and a bit earthy.. just a bit. Lightly spiced thankfully. Pretty much smells like apple crisp. Pretty tasty and once again thankfully underspiced. Tart apples, light spice, plenty of tang and acidity. Thick and slick and leaves a solid mouth coating.

The nose is literally like an apple pie, notes of fresh red and green apples accompanying heaps of vanilla and cinnamon, with traces of baked pastry. Flavors follow suit, nicely sweet from the broiled apple, with loads of caramelized brown sugar and cinnamon lending to the baked goods sort of feel. Theres a light, zingy tartness on the finish, which counters all the sweetness nicely. Big bodied, slick, and viscous on the tongue, the palate shows like an ice cider. Damn good stuff.
