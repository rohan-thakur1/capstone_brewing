3859,"2017-05-16",4.2,"Tasted from can. Pours a murky orange with white head. Aroma is citrus and some tropical fruits. Not as robust of an aroma as some tree house beers. Flavors of orange, papaya, mango, melon. Well balanced very well done IPA.

3859,"2017-05-03",4.0,"16 ounce can. Pours a hazy golden orange with a nice white head. Aroma of tropical and citrus fruits. Taste is pineapple, orange, grapefruit, lemon, mango, and malt. Delicious.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
3859,"2017-04-30",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed at Corbets house warming on April 23. 16 oz can. The pour is a nice hazy yellow orange color with a thicker white head and a nice bit of lace as it falls and vanishes. The aroma is full of tropical fruits and a bright hoppiness. There is a light citrus zest on the back end with a little bit of a sweet malt. The flavor is a little more pine resin forward with a bitterness about it. The tropical fruits fade a bit, but this is well balanced and excellent. The mouth feel is light and clean with a bright carbonation and a bitter hop leaf and a lovely fruitiness about it. I love this beer. Its the perfect combination of juiciness, tropical fruits, bitter pine resin, and everything you want in an IPA, Damnit Tree House. Just when I write you off in favor if Trillium, you come back and do this.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3859,"2017-04-21",3.9,"16oz can thanks to Steve. Pours out a hazy cloudy gold topped with a white head. Nose is tropical fruit notes some alfalfa and orange juice. Taste is more of the orange juice hops green and some sweetness.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"

3859,"2016-11-03",4.4,"Can at home, in a Tree House stem glass. Every time I think that Tree House might be overhyped, I have a glass of something like this and it reminds me of just how talented these guys are. The malt bill is trademark TH, clean and light but with just a little bit of cracker / grain character. Its also one of the best smelling beers Ive ever come across, with waves of pungent citrus and floral aromas as soon as you crack open the can. Flavor is extremely complex, with lime and oranges mixing with the malt grain before finishing with a moderate bitterness and a sharp, crisp dryness. Theres no way around it, this is really exceptional beer.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
3859,"2016-10-30",4.3,"Pours hazy straw yellow. Aroma is just blowing me away, nice clean tropical fruits, without excess sweetness. Herbal hops also there. Why dont they make aroma candles with this aroma? Taste is also fruity, papaya, mango and also green bitterness. Hops are strong and finish is dry and with lingering medulla bitterness. Awesome, awesome, awesome.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
3859,"2016-10-19",4.5,"Canned 9/22/16, drunk 10/6/16, thanks to Nelson for sharing.Thoroughly hazy, light, pale-golden body is topped by a medium-sized white head showing moderate to moderately-strong retention.Nose is just phenomenally understated. It takes a while to come on, but slowly a lushness unfolds of mossy, green, mineralesque Nelson notes, full of lime and lemon skin, light grape and balanced by a soft, honey-laden malt. The citra adds a more direct, orange-tangerine brightness that, I think, actually helps bring out and highlight the Nelson notes, as the hops are quite different and its fairly easy to pick each out. Unbelievably aromatic, as usual for Tree House, with zero resin, no obnoxious malt to get in the way and no alcohol or flaw.Soft, dry, tightly carbonated and full of green, dank, mossy Nelson mixing with juicy, tangerine and orange-like citra notes. Quite the combo and even though I love Galaxy and Mosaic, I this might be my favorite combination of two hops. The juiciness isnt nearly as watermelon-flavored as it usually is with Tree House, but rather its full of lime and citrus. Ultra-soft, with just a hint of honey from the malt and lingering tangerine, nectarine, mango and lime. No resin, but ample bitterness to balance. Such masters!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3859,"2016-10-17",4.3,"Can shared. Thanks Kaori and Jon! Pours a hazy golden peach color with a finger of foam that lingers. Huge papaya, tangerine and peach nose. Juicy on the palate. More tropical fruit, guava, papaya, passion fruit. Good bitterness on the finish. Maybe a tad bitter compared to some of their other offerings, but still so good.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"
3859,"2016-10-15",3.8,"Hazy white yellow color. The nose is out of this world. White peaches, lime, mangoes and slightly biscuity. Amazing nose. Light body, but lacks a bit of backbone. Tons of bitterness. A bit of warming at the end. Slightly boozy. Amazing nose but falls down a bit after that.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
3859,"2016-10-13",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2016 Drinking this next to Alter Ego as theyre similar abv Tree House IPAs. Pours a fairly muddy copper with a white head. Nose is soft and quite expressive of peach and pear. More carbonation upfront, then quickly into the peach/pear tandem, which is a soft and very Tree House pairing. Nice musty hops (Nelson). Feel isnt quite as thick as Julius or Alter Ego. More similar to Julius than Alter Ego, but a bit lighter, more effervescent, and with an extra dimension of dank/musty hops. Nice, one of the best ones from Tree House.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
