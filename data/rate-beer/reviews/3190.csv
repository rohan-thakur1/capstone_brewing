3190,"2017-03-10",3.2,"330mL bottle from Slowbeer
Pale straw body, clear body, white foam.
Moderate nose to it - get a distinct grainy malt character with fragrant floral & citrusy hops.
Medium-light body, drying texture but clean overall.
Grainy, husk, cereal sort of malt - provides a dryness of its own early on - leads into moderate fruity hops & florals, and a restrained bitterness.
Really nice overall - a lager that would compete with most golden & some pale ales.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

3190,"2014-11-24",3.4,"An interesting entry by 2 Brothers that doesn't quite engage the taste buds to the extent that you would expect a Rice Beer to. A slightly shark aroma is contrasted by a smooth palate that doesn't quite reach the peaks you expect. Worth a taste but not upper echelon.

3190,"2013-08-29",3.2,"from a 330ml bottle on 29/8/2013. Pours a clear medium yellow with a small head. Has quite a nice light fruity aroma featuring lychee, pineapple and passionfruit. The flavour is more subdued in comparison, with some sweet fruity notes, a bit of rice and some light bready malt. The body is light and carbonation moderate. Easy to drink and very interesting for a pale lager.","Canberra, AUSTRALIA","Maris"

3190,"2012-11-26",3.4,"On tap at Mrs Parmas. Pours a vibrant orange with a small white head. Aroma is very hoppy - lots of citrus and grapefruit, followed closely by bits of rice and pine. Smells amazing. Hops are very upfront to start with which holds nicely whilst the rice notes linger at the backend. Super easy drinking and goes down wonderfully on tap","AUSTRALIA","jonnyguns"

3190,"2012-06-15",3.1,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2012 330ml bottle. 2 fingers pure white head. Frothy head, almost like beaten egg white, but with some larger bubbles. Fades quickly to a cap. Colour is a clear light golden, almost like apple juice. Nice orange, floral and slightly peachy hop nose, with just a hint of a grainy, musty, dusty note which may be from the rice. Straight up, loads of peach and sweetness on the attack. Also, some refreshing orange and lime citrus flavours. Peach flavours for days. A slight bit of hop bitterness on the finish, with a tiny jab of herbaceousness and some citrus. Leaves a pleasant lagery taste in the mouth, which fades quickly. As the beer warms you get more of a rice flavour on the finish, which is quite pleasant. Very crisp and clean. Mouth feel is very soft. I really mean that. Almost like having a pillow in your mouth. Carbonation is fine. Good basic beer. Not overly complex, but refreshing, well rounded and well made.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Niksko"
3190,"2012-05-30",3.1,"Tried this at AIBA dinner. Wasnt expecting a lot from this rice lager but a good dose of hops come through in the taste .","Perth, AUSTRALIA","bluevegie"
3190,"2012-05-27",3.4,"Pours pale yellow with a large, quickly fading head.
Nose shows grassy hops, soft fruit (lychee, pear?). Very little else.
Flavours include the same light fruit along with some very soft sweet malt. Those hops a damn nice.
Carbonation is very high but needs to be really, considering how sweet this is.
Apart from that this was pretty good stuff, could be quite dangerous of a hot afternoon!","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Davros"
3190,"2012-05-05",3.4,"It is unusual to normally enjoy a beer of this style. Nice apricot aroma and pour is very light amber, crystal clear and thin white head. Flavor is initial apricot that moves to a very faint bittering finish and like a ninja it is gone.","Bentleigh, AUSTRALIA","Dredd"
3190,"2012-05-05",3.0,"On tap at 3 degrees. Better-than-average pale lager. Aromas of hay, citrus, and wet leaves. Taste is sweet, with light bitterness, and short length. Palate is oily, and medium bodied. Yellow, with a frothy head.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","davidm"
3190,"2012-04-26",3.7,"Bottle from Mane Liquor. Pours bright orange with a small white head which quickly disappears. Lacing clings to the glass nicely. Aroma is very vibrant hops - lots of citrus, zest and grapefruit, followed closely by rice and pine. Very nice nose. Vibrant citric hoppage to begin with which doesnt entirely die down while the rice note takes control. Finishes like Ive just swallowed a sushi roll. Spritzy carbonation but flows nicely. Really well made beer and something unique. I like it a lot","Perth, AUSTRALIA","maneliquor"
