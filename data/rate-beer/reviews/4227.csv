4227,"2017-06-15",4.0,"Sample from a 33cl bottle at Leuven Innovation Beer Festival 2017 (5 VI 2017). The looks are splendid: a perfect looking, light pink coloured collar, pretty vivid, topping a great, clean, fluorine red body. The start is appealing for sure. The nose is a spiced infused fruit ale with flavours of raspberries and redcurrants. There is an interesting black pepper dash in there as well. The taste begins with a rhubarb onset, a ginger and black pepper body, some subtle redcurrant features and a medium carbonation. The sourness is sharp and acidic. The mouthfeel is quite dry, making this a lovely quencher - as it was a hot beer festival day. This must portray the krieks oak aged treatment.","Waarschoot, BELGIUM","Hamirubi"
