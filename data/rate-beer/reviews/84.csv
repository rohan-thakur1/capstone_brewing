84,"2016-11-24",3.8,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours rich mahogany. Flavor is spicy with coffee notes and a fair amount of oak coming through. Pumpkin flavor is very mild and made milder by the aging Im guessing. Could pass as a simple barrel aged porter or stout. Flavor lacks depth though so is in general a good beer but not exceptional.","Illinois, USA","drdisque"
84,"2016-10-14",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 16, 2016 Tap at Clubhouse BFD. Pours amber red, thin white head. Aroma is lots of sweet pumpkin pie spice and pumpkin pie filling, cinnamon. Heavy bourbon notes, vanilla. Reminiscent of Pumpking. Flavor is bourbon (lots of bourbon), intense pumpkin spice, pumpkin pie filling, cinnamon. Cream soda. Very good.","New York, USA","SG111"
84,"2016-10-03",3.2,"Pours copper with almost no head and no lacing. Aroma is very sweet. Pumpkin pie spice with some vanilla and light bourbon. Flavor is also very sweet. Pumpkin pie spices with bourbon and vanilla notes. Medium/full body. Sticky texture. Warming alcohol finish. Really sweet and at 15 bucks a bottle its a dud.","rochester hills, Michigan, USA","libertine"
84,"2016-09-18",3.3,"Refrigerated brown bomber extra from FlandersNed poured into a snifter. Hazy dark orange with small off-white head. Aroma is ripe pumpkin, medium body, lower carbonation, and little lacing. Taste is ripe pumpkin, oak, spice (nutmeg, some ginger, and cinnamon), some bourbon, and hints of vanilla. Heavy beer, might want to share this one.","Charleston Area, West Virginia, USA","weihenweizen"
84,"2016-03-27",3.7,"Bottle, thanks to DeyHolla! Slightly hazy deep Orange pour with a modest white head. Aroma is fairly spicy. Allspice, nutmeg, some clove. A bit of vanilla. Flavor is similar. Fairy spicy. Chewy carame malt. Toastyed wood. Somewhat boozy. Full body, active carb. Solid for a BA pumpkin beer.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"

84,"2016-01-10",4.1,"tap. deep amber with small head. the regular screamin pumpkin is one of the better pumpkin beers out there, this seemed like a cant miss, and as anticipated, its a winner. moderate bourbon comes through well, but doesnt overwhelm. plenty of pumpkin pie spice. flavors meld well. recommended.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"
84,"2015-12-06",4.2,"Pour on tap at Taps 25, dark orange pour with slightly off white head, aroma brought notes of big pumpkin, vanilla, slight oak into bourbon, oak, slight caramel, toffee.

84,"2015-11-05",3.5,"Shared at a tasting hosted by Steve Hackley on September 25. Thanks Steve! This was poured from a 22 oz bottle, waxed of course. The pour is a dark copper color, almost dark enough to be a light brown with a thin light beige head and some decent lacing. The small head is surprising, since it was a huge gusher when it was cracked open. The aroma is surprisingly pretty good. There is a ton of pumpkin spices, specifically cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. There is a light vanilla and a decent bourbon presence. Not a whole lot of pumpkin happening, but pumpkin pie spice. The flavor is definitely dominated by the spices, nutmeg and allspice specifically. I wish there was more in the way of cinnamon and vanilla, but alas, its a touch disappointing in that regard. The mouth feel is pretty good. Decently thick and creamy with a nice soft carbonation and a lingeringly oaky, spiced aftertaste. I wouldnt get a whole bottle of this to myself, but I could see taking a small pour here and there.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
84,"2015-10-22",3.7,"Aroma is mostly bourbon with some hints of spices, taste has nice fall spice, a lot of vanilla, some bourbon, and malts. Nice","grand rapids, Michigan, USA","njager246"
84,"2015-10-20",4.3,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2015 vintage released recently. Pours lightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, biscuit, bourbon, toasted oak, and herbal/spice earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, pumpkin/spices, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge caramel, brown sugar, pumpkin, toffee, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, biscuit, bourbon, toasted oak, and herbal/spice earthiness. Light-moderate herbal bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, biscuit, bourbon, toasted oak, and herbal/spice earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, pumpkin/spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a smooth, fairly creamy/slick, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged pumpkin ale. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, pumpkin/spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
84,"2015-10-18",4.1,"Pours amber, bit of foam. Looks good. Aroma is full of spices. Nutmeg, berries, red currant, sour juice feel to it but still has this pumpkin gingerbread feel to it also. Taste is not subtle at all, strong honey. Alcohol comes through and warms you, just as sitting next to a fireplace. Sweet. Spicy. Lovely. Juice and Christmas cookies at the same time. Sweetness is there but not disturbing. Real imperial pumpkin beer, a rare breed.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
84,"2015-10-06",3.8,"Bottle: &nbsp Amber, a bit dark, thin to moderate foamy sandy head, light lacing. &nbsp Sweet bourbony nose, 

soft spices. &nbsp Has also a caramel or toffee aspect. &nbsp Smooth on the tongue, sweet, all the same aspects are 

represented on the tongue. &nbsp Has also a little bit of soft heat on the backside. &nbsp Spices come out more on 

the tongue as it warms, and on the backside. &nbsp Starts to remind me of Bourbon Maple Syrupe on French Toast with 

a little whipped Cream. &nbsp Now I am hungry for breakfast! &nbsp Not over the top with spices, nice bourbon 

notes, warming, just a great example. &nbsp Thanks Kevin!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
84,"2015-10-02",3.6,"On tap, poured into a goblet. The aroma is a sweet bourbon and wood blend initially with a mellow pumpkin pie spice underneath. The beer pours clear and orange with a white, unstable soap head that has mild retention and light lace. The taste is highly sweet with a medium light bitter. The thick, syrup texture is accompanied by a fuzzy carbonation, and has a full body with an interesting citrus and pumpkin spice blend and a bit of booze up front. The finish is spicy with an alcohol, mild warmth, pumpkin pie spice, and butterscotch. The aftertaste is boozy with a dry bourbon cloying quality and some caramel.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"
84,"2015-10-01",3.0,"Bottle. Brownish color thin head. Pumpkin spice and vanilla aroma. Taste is muddled spice and no barrel. Some pumpkin.","bloomfield, Michigan, USA","mikem409"
84,"2015-09-25",4.6,"Pours a dark copper with a thin white head. Aroma is oak, vanilla, and pumpkin spices, with nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice standing out. Flavor is dominated more by the spices, with the oak and vanilla adding some depth. Very boozy, leaving a warming sensation. Reminiscent of a barley wine, especially with its thick, syrupy body. I was very impressed with this. My only issue is that its a touch too sweet - dangerously sweet at 9%.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","chucklemation"
84,"2015-09-23",4.2,"22oz bottle bought at the brewery. Clear, burnt orange hue with a low, beige head. One of the best pumpkin beers ever! I pictured both 2014 & 2015 here - both are excellent. Big pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice and oaked bourbon nose and taste - the brewery descriptor is dead-on. Gotta let it warm a bit, & always better on tap, but a definite go-to if you like bourbon &/or yams. Full+ body and medium carbonation.",", Indiana, USA","FlandersNed"
84,"2015-09-16",4.1,"Bottle. Aroma is well spiced, light bourbon, juicy. Taste is pretty good, light sweetness, pumpkin, spice, little bit of bourbon again. Caramel. Very nice.","Tokyo, JAPAN","shoulderbroken"
84,"2015-09-11",3.9,"Dark amber color. Big juicy nose with unbelievable amount of nutmeg, with cinammon, oak, pumpkin and bourbon is actually down played. There is nothing subtle about this beer at all. Big bourbon, pumpkin, cinammon, nutmeg and juicy full bodied beer. The cinammon lingers in the finish. Over spiced and over the top but I really like this.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
84,"2015-03-02",3.6,"This poured a darker orange color with a white head. Aroma was big poking flesh, spice and Bourbon. Flavor mainly baked pumpkin soaked in Bourbon with mild cinnamon. Nice","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
84,"2015-02-05",3.7,"Had on tap at the brewery. Pours a surprisingly deep red color. Lots of bubbles settle on top. A huge pumpkin aroma. The taste goes with the flavor. A ton of pumpkin. All over pumpkin. If you like pumpkin you will like this.","Michigan, USA","SpongeRuiner"

84,"2014-11-06",3.8,"Draft. Poured clear orange copper color with an average white frothy head that was mostly lasting with very good lacing. Solid pumpkin, wood and spice aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy pumpkin spice flavor with a medium to heavy spice sweet finish of moderate to long duration. Good seasonal beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
84,"2014-11-04",3.4,"Draft at Crunchy's. Hazy brown with a tan head. Pumpkin spice and vanilla in your face. Lots of bourbon and actual pumpkin flavor which is weird in a pumpkin beer. Lots of ginger cookie in the finish.","Michigan, USA","Mittenator"

84,"2014-10-25",4.0,"Tap at Detroit Fall Beer Fest. Opaque orangey-gold. Full body. Tastes of sweet bourbon with a subtle kick of pumpkin spice. ABV noticeable for sure.","Michigan, USA","firstsip"
84,"2014-10-10",3.8,"Bottle thanks to Jason (I think) for sharing. Light brown pour with very little head. Aroma is just packed with pumpkin pie, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Taste has so much vanilla. Moderately spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg which is nice. Not much bourbon at all but a bunch of vanilla and some oak from the barrel. Medium body. Very tasty pumpkin beer.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
84,"2014-09-27",4.0,"Tap @ Griffin Claw: Super hazy copper, nearly brown body with a foamy, ecru collar that leaves nice sheets of lacing along the glass. Aroma of pumpkin pie... Not just spices, this actually smells like goddamn pie. Meaty pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, cream, ginger, graham cracker... Wow, very nice. No bourbon in the aroma, but lovely pumpkin pie & holiday smells. Taste has some bourbon to it... Tastes like a bourbon infused pumpkin dessert. Pumpkin, light woody tannins, cinnamon spice, vanilla cream, nutmeg, very warming from front to back. A hint of bourbon & tannin in the finish with a lingering cinnamon, graham, & pumpkin note. Very nice.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
84,"2014-09-27",3.8,"On tap: The aroma consists of moderate-heavy graham cracker, whip cream, vanilla, moderate cinnamon, lighter nutmeg, and ginger. Its dark transparent copper with a small off-white head that fades to a thin film outlined by a thicker ring. The flavor starts with moderate graham cracker, light vanilla, and a touch of whip cream. The finish has moderate cinnamon, lighter ginger, nutmeg, allspice, and a hint of bourbon. Its medium-full bodied with soft carbonation and mouthfeel. Overall, a tad too heavy on the cinnamon, but very tasty.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
