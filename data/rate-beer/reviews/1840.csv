1840,"2008-06-09",3.9,"In short: A strong and superior maibock.
How: Hand-bottle from BrianK, huge thanks a lot Brian!!!  Consumed within a week of receiving it
The look: Partly cloudy golden-orange body with a small off-white head
In long: Ripe citrus on the nose and some boiled eggs white.  Taste is smooth, bready with very ripe fruits (citrus, apples and peaches).  That typical lager sensation that I can never put into word.  Alcohol is mostly absent from the flavour profile which is surprising for the relatively strong abv.  Splendid body with a not-completely-baked bread mouthfeel (almost doughy) and a lot of small bubbles.  Very chewy.  An excellent Maibock that truly deserves to be one of most highest rated Heller Bock on ratebeer (if not THE highest one).  And thats totally justified, if only the word was that fair Elvis would still be alive and all the impersonators would be dead.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Cotton candy, vanilla, pastry crust, and basic doughnut flavor; full, sweet nuttiness of pistachio flowering in the mid palate.

Caramel sweetness held in check by a flowery, pencil-shavings noble hops taste, all perfectly melded together so you cant tell where the malt begins and the hops take over, or is that the other way around? A dash of salt in the flavor, too, which I find n some bocks. Warm and toasty in case your Spring is delayed, this is a true comfort beer. Slightly sticky and oily palate, as prescribed.

1840,"2006-06-11",4.2,"04.29.06  TAPNY, but this is not my first sample of this excellent maibock.  Like the Eisbock, this beer from High Point is highly anticipated and consistently outstanding.  Unfortunately, its just about impossible to get your hands on outside of North Jersey or a couple of select pubs (none of which are EVER at the Jersey Shore).  The aroma is one that returns memories of great experiences, those being previous opportunities to sample this very beer.  Full of sweet-tart apple aromas and flavor enhanced with vanilla, tropical fruits, and a milky sweetness that lasts throughout.  This may be the first time Ive used milky sweetness but it truly is that -- sweet like whole milk, almost creamy, and yet never becoming cloying -- its not a sugary sweetness.  The finish is all malt with the pilsner coming through in a glorious bite of grasses and herbs, touch acid-tart.  Lovely beer.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

1840,"2006-05-11",4.8,"Light bronze. Retentive layer of white foam. Clean and airy aroma of toasted hay, fennel, and wafery malts. Lightly lemony with a fresh hint of floral hops. Soft and fluffy carbonation. Initially grainy in texture, yet with a vividly defined arrangement of sweet, feathery malts. Hop character is multidimensional with a poised bitterness coupled with a vibrantly vivacious array of hop flavors which enhance the flowery softness. Candy apples grace the tongue with a sweet glaze fullness which helps pillar the body. Snippet of spicy alcohol warmth ensues. Deeply rooted Munich reveals toasted biscuits and caramelized honey, but the overall flavors remain unchanged as the malt sweetness never becomes forced. Exceptionally full and fluffy Pilsner malt foundation also complements and tempers the richer malt elements. Delectably juicy, with a quenching twinge of acidity, to boot,  and impeccably attenuated, with a subtle depth-lending dusting of mineral dryness. Finishes well-rounded and soft, with a seamlessly interwoven fusion of anise-tinged hops and snappy toast. A captivating example of delicateness combined with complexity. So pure and pristine.

1840,"2005-04-04",2.9,"Ramstein brews this German Maibock in North Joisey.   I imagine this recipe is close to what youd sample in Bavaria.   Yeasty, musty aroma, crisp hop bitterness, and spicy pepper flavors are all represented in the sample.   My personal preference is for a sweeter bock than this one.","Glenside, Pennsylvania, USA","JFGrind"
1840,"2005-04-02",3.7,"On tap at Andys.  This ia an ok Maibock.  Malty, and sweet flavors.  Finishes smooth and clean.","New Jersey, USA","beerslayer"
1840,"2005-04-01",3.8,"on tap, amber in color.  mild hoppy flavor, fruity tones, nice tan head,  and smooth finish.","New Jersey, USA","Sirjohn03"
1840,"2005-03-30",3.7,"hand bottled from a growler courtesy of Lou18.  tarnished copper in color.  mild flavors all the way around.  mild malt, spice, yeast and hops.  not a lot of carbonation, which is similiar to the Winter Wheat.  nice smooth and very drinkable bock.  Thanks Lou!","Quad-Cities, Illinois, USA","barleyPops"
1840,"2005-03-25",3.7,"Poured dark amber from tap at Andys, Small head, sweet aroma, with a trace of yeast. There was a nice smooth hop finish. Good maibock.","West Paterson, New Jersey, USA","Lou18"
1840,"2005-03-19",3.7,"From a growler thanks to MaiBockAddict. Poured darker than I expected, a murky dark amber color with a small tan head. Aroma of mild malts, fresh bread and some spices. Flavor was pretty similar but with a dry hop finish where you can finally taste the alcohol that was kept so well hidden.","Nutley, New Jersey, USA","jimmack"
1840,"2005-03-17",3.6,"on tap at the brewery, a medium yellow/bronze color with mild tan head. aroma is very yeasty and malty, with some fruit tones. flavor has alot of malts going on, with a slight cider taste on the tail end of each sip.  a little bit of residual bitterness lingered in my mouth at the end of the glass.  body was in the middle of the road, i enjoyed this beer thouroughly.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","richlikebeer"
1840,"2005-03-04",1.7,"Boring under attenuated beer of little complexity or depth. I love maibocks and this is not a good representative example.","manteca, California, USA","aspidites"
1840,"2004-10-16",3.5,"April 2004. In honor of MaibockAddict. Golden ale with a fruity slightly lactic aroma. Good malts and apples with aromatic alcoholic warmth. Very smooth and balanced.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
1840,"2004-07-15",3.8,"on tap at blind tiger. seemed a bit weird having a maibock in a small glass but oh well. sweet, slightly tropical aroma with a little bit of anzac cookie dough. plenty of alcohol in the taste with a hint of baking soda, some stewed fruit and pleasant metallic bitter finish.","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
1840,"2004-05-28",3.9,"I liked this beer more than the Heartland Maibock, frankly.  Less harsh alcohol taste.  In fact, the Ramsteins alcohol is virtually undetectable.  Not terribly malty and somewhat innucuous, IMHO.  I have no idea why its rated so highly, although I love Ramstein as much as the next guy.  On tap at The Gate (Brooklyn).","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
1840,"2004-05-16",4.0,"I cant complain too much about this beer, but I have to say, Im not sure why exactly its so highly rated.  Its not as malty as some bocks, and its very fruity.  Dates and Apples and Pears.  A nice balance of tartness and sweetness.  Full body, and nice mouthfeel.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"
1840,"2004-05-16",3.9,"On tap at The Gate.  Poured a yellow golden color with a minimal head.  Aroma was spice and cinammon.  Taste was spice with some sweetness, some fruit, almost like cherry.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","Shadrach"
1840,"2004-05-16",4.5,"[draught] This beer is amazing! - dirty-blonde pour with medium carbonation and compact head - sweet aroma of light fruits and candy - a tiny hint of tartness up front, that fades away to a medium bodied, malty explosion of flavors - there are a lot of more ""summer oriented"" fruits here, strawberries in particular, but also cherries and a touch of pears - this beer is clean, yet chewy and malty at the same time - strawberries stick around in the finish for quite some time - excellent stuff - the best Ramstein Ive had so far, and that includes the winter wheat.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
1840,"2004-04-29",3.6,"(Draught) Pours a medium, white lasting head and a golden body with medium carbonation. Nose is sweety and lactic. Nice malt, crisp and fresh. Good finish.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"

1840,"2004-04-27",3.7,"Sweaty, malt aroma. Dark, golden with tan head that recedes slowly. Quite bitter, hoppy and crisp. Lighter body then expected. Sort of like a pils/kolsch bock. On tap at TapNY festival.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
1840,"2004-04-25",3.8,"TAP NY, sample.  Thick, malty, flowery sweet nose, good lacing, light amber color.  Fairly light-bodied, more bitter than I would have expected, crisp, good balance, some nice honey.  Very good, but didn't blow me away and was destined not to be even the best Maibock of the day.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1840,"2004-04-04",4.7,"This is incredible.   Incredible color. Rich full body.  Full of malt character.   This is about the best you could ask for.","montvale, New Jersey, USA","ruffian"
1840,"2004-03-27",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2005 I must concur with other raters thus far.  This beer is exceptional!  It pours a glorious golden color with a good lasting off-white head.  Aroma of apples, vanilla, and sweet, sweet caramel.  Tastes much the same, with a heavy body that is lusciously sweet and coating.  Finishes cleanly.  This is a bit unbalanced towards hops when it is too cold, but displays its finest qualities from cellar temp all the way up to room temp.  I drank this all day yesterday (literally) and it did not get cloying.  This is super-drinkable.  What a fine beer!","Pennsylvania, USA","Probiere"
