1872,"2012-12-07",3.2,"Bottle shared by plank10. Thanks Nick.

The beer is orange hued with a thin white head that leaves sparse lacing on the glass. The aroma carries grain, fruit, malt, sweetness. Smells like a bock. The taste follows suit, with a present sweetness throughout. Fruit, grains, and a bit of alcohol. Fairly thin in body. A decent beer, but not on par with the authentic German examples of the style.
