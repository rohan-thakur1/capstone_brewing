2694,"2017-03-11",4.2,"Bottle, 22oz, shared by bergstaden. Close to black in the glass, very very dark brown, clear-looking, and with a dense dark beige head. The aroma is quite heavy, yet mellow, with roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, some prunes and bourbon, vanilla and a spiced hint. Its full-bodied and warming, smooth and sweet, with a good bitterness to deal with the sugars. Roasted malts. coffee, chocolate, bourbon, wood and vanilla, some faint cardamom hints and an earthy hint. Lasting finish. A really delicious beer indeed, smooth, mellow and tasteful. 170311","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

2694,"2015-11-07",3.3,"Shared 650 ml bottle, in Nevada City, October 2015. The bottle looked exactly the same as the picture here, so I assume this must be the correct beer (12% ABV, brewed with honey, no mention of being brewed with coffee nor vanilla). Dark brown colour, fairly sweet and alcoholic, notes of honey, chocolate, bourbon, molasses and coffee in aroma and flavour. A fairly impressive beer, but still not as great as I hoped.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"

2694,"2014-08-12",4.6,"Bottle... Muckfest 2014 Pours murky and brown with a tiny, brief, khaki head. The aroma is a decadent swirl of vanilla, toasted oak, toffee, caramel, bourbon and praline with a touch of toasted coconut and a rumor of cinnamon. Full-bodied with soft carbonation. Much like the bouquet, the flavor is absolutely sumptuous and nearly shines as brightly. Roasty and super-malty, but not crazy sweet. Not stupid boozy either.  Good balance here. Lengthy, warming, vanilla and praline finish.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

2694,"2014-06-19",4.3,"Woodshed 3.0! Sample courtesy of Sparky. The bottle pours with a mahogany colored body that supports a tan head. The aroma offers up molasses, sweet bourbon, a dash of oak, a thin river of plum juice reduction and then a credible mesa of YUM. Nice. The taste is smooth and rich with spicy oak, molasses, smooth sweet bourbon, vanilla, marshmallow and some chocolate brownie. This is a very nice sipper thats rich and near nectar like and it is very cohesive and balanced which is impressive with everything that is going on here.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

2694,"2014-05-25",3.6,"Somehow I was expecting an imperial stout, kind of like the wax cap series. What I got was somewhere between a stout and a barley wine - really nice, though a tad on the sweet side. No hint of alcohol. Syrupy medium mouthfeel. Almost no head, but lots of light tan lacing. Nose is slight honey, with malt and oak. Roasted malt dominates the taste, with a bit of oak and big sweet finish with just a hint of astringency. I like this, but it is certainly one to share.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"

M- medium oily body with a medium sweet then bitter palate. Decent carbonation. T- very similar to aroma. Bourbon and wood start. Vanilla, milk chocolate and caramel muddled the middle. Bitter hops come next and linger through the sustained end. Some raisins and clover honey notes. Ending is dry and bitter.  A little dirty and gritty.  Some sun tea, grapefruit and caramel.

2694,"2014-02-07",3.9,"22 oz. bottle thanks to Adam Jackson for bringing this back from Cali. Color is nearly black but more dark dirty brown. Thin white head around the edges of my BCBS snifter. Nose is large oak influence with caramel and traces of whiskey after a swirl of the snifter. 
 Flavor is subtle bourbon upfront with the expected notes of vanilla, oak and coconut. Secondary flavors of a honey type sweetness with chocolate and light rye whiskey spice. Texture is oily with a creamy carbonation. This is a fresh bourbon barrel brew; the flavor is ridiculously smooth and subtle. This will not shatter your mind but it is quality without a doubt.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
2694,"2014-02-07",3.7,"Grabbed this up at Blackwells Wine & Spirits for $20ish a bottle in SF. Enjoyed with AirForceHops on a crisp and dry friday evening. Sadly, Subway closed so Im drinking this without the joyous double meat big philly cheese-steak that was sooooo anticipated. They would have paired well. I am all alone. Only my skinny jeans retain my hipster self.....sigh. Enjoyed at 55F in a snifter.

A - Pours a murky brown. In the glass, edges have some toilet water notes. Looks like a stout barley wine mix pretty much straight up. 

S - Nose is very oak heavy...caramel, candy corns, honey, nutella, graham cracker and some ginger. Has some peaty qualities...a touch of earl grey tea.

T - Yeah, this is pretty smoke heavy. The salty astringent sea kelp taste at the finish certainly detracts. The cocoa, caramel and licorice. There is a little sweetness that does help with the saltiness. Smoke is off-putting along with the ashy clam juice but this is a sipper that does open up at warmer temps and is still best shared with a friend. (ball-jokes aside)

M - Sweet, kind of oily, totally leans toward the porter mouthfeel over barley wine. Sweetness at the finish and an everlasting northwest hop bitterness of pine and juice lasts for days.

O - Id have this one again, maybe after it sat for a while.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
