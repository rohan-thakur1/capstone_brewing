2336,"2017-02-23",3.9,"2013 vintage with a gold foil cap. Crown cap with a cork. Dont get it. Pours an interesting cola like appearance. On first sip there is a bit of noticeable vinegar. Some brown sugar, red wine and root beer flavors. A touch of vanilla to round it out. Not bad really. Has a nice warming flavor to it. Not overly tart but just enough.","seattle, Washington, USA","cobaink2"
2336,"2016-10-06",4.1,"Bottle shared by alexsdad06. Poured clear dark reddish/brown color with an average tan head that lasted with excellent lacing. Very complex dark tart fruit, wood and alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with a tingly texture and flat carbonation. Full complex dark fruit sweet flavor with solid fruity sweet finish and a very small bite of alcohol. Very good standout brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
2336,"2016-09-10",4.0,"750 ml bottle capped and corked via trade and shared with Tmoney99. Pours a deep mahogany color with a medium sized beige head. The aroma and flavor have caramel malts, light toast, dark fruits, a nice tart character throughout, vinous, wood,some Belgian yeast, a touch acidic,some earthy notes, lots of fun, I didnt know what to expect from this one but was pleasantly surprised.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
2336,"2015-12-18",4.1,"Nothing like Fat Bastard. Wow. Tart cherries and dark fruit over what was once a very sweet beer. High carb, nice and dusty, with significant tannins from the barrels. Lovely.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"
2336,"2015-10-07",4.1,"Deep ruby red with an effervescent tan head. Aroma is full of tart cherry, lightly sweet, some must, slight vinous, a hint of booze. Body has nice tiny bubbles with a good dry mouthfeel in the end. Flavor is mostly tart cherry with a good bit of yeast, musty notes, and a bit of woody notes. Finish is sour and dry. A very nice brew. The most interesting and complex offering Ive had from Silver City.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
2336,"2014-08-23",4.0,"Poured from bottle to glass. Dark hazy copper hue with fizzy off white heads that dissipated to a ring. Aroma is lactic, oak, straw, caramel, scotch, earthy. Mouthfeel is fantastic with a medium body and zesty carbonation. Taste is dry sweetness followed by a tartness in the following and a clean finish. Overall this is a really nice brew.","Sweet Home, Oregon, USA","Salmoniform"
2336,"2014-08-17",3.4,"Bottle (750ml): Pours a clearish brown. Not much head but lots and lots of carbonation. Good lacing. I do get hints of the Fat Scotch Ale in this, but there are also the funky smells and high carbonation and tartness. Overall a very nice sour, but I prefer the straight Scotch Ale. For me, no need to spend the big bucks for this when I enjoy the very awesome Fat Scotch Ale, but if you prefer Sours, you might really like this.","Woodinville, Washington, USA","jsnicholas"
2336,"2014-06-07",4.2,"750, corked, capped, and foiled. Gorgeous, gorgeous presentation. Pours a crystal clear but very, very dark amber with a big surging bubbly head that settles away very quickly. Piercing tangy balsamic and soft lemony nose with great earthy, peaty underpinnings and lots and lots and lots of fresh barrel stave. Very appealing, not least due to its uniqueness. The oak would piss me off in most other beers when its this present, but here it feels harmonious despite its intense forwardness. Creamy medium body with lively carb. Earthy, peaty, complex attack, followed by a tangier mid palate and a long dry oaky finish thats effervescent enough to stay coherent. It never leans too far one way or another, despite needing to balance several very different and very pronounced elements in its flavor and aromatics profiles. Beautifully done. You definitely have not heard enough about how spectacular this beer is, so now you have to drink some so youll know.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2336,"2014-06-07",4.0,"750 ml bottle -- thanks, Tom! Pours clear ruby with khaki head that quickly dissipates to a ring. Cherry, vanilla, and balsamic vinegar on the nose. Taste brings a nice tartness, with pronounced oak and a bit of smoke. Theres a little copper initially, but that drops off. Finishes dry. Overall: this is really nice.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
2336,"2014-05-24",4.2,"Overall I think this is quite good. The biggest problem it has is that the beer is slightly unbalanced. Specifically, the sourness overshadows the base scotch ale a bit too much. Somewhat of a nitpick, however.","Gilbert, Arizona, USA","mikedR"
2336,"2014-04-30",4.7,"Nice pleasant aroma of oak and wine character from the barrels with overlays of fig, plum, cherries and some brightness. Pours a orange pink with a off white dense foam cap. Great body and mouthfeel not overly sour, but very well balanced and drinkable at 9.9%. Awesome wish I would have bought one to age.","Washington, USA","chuckstout"
2336,"2014-03-16",5.0,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2014 Remarkably complex, smooth and balanced sour with lots of red wine tannins, sour cherries, and figs(revealing its Scotch Ale beginnings),and the requisite horse blanket and funk. Perfection.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Caskalefan"
2336,"2012-12-07",4.0,"Bottle This beer rocks! Clear dirty-orange ale with a small, fizzy, white head thats gone in a flash. The nose is a malty, earthy swirl of caramel, wood, tree nuts and funk. Full-bodied with jazzy carbonation. The flavor provides a good measure of lactic acidity, moderate praline sweetness and light bitterness. Tangy-sweet finish - a touch more tangy than sweet. Thanks to newcigarz for sharing this world class oddity with the south Florida crew!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2336,"2012-07-03",4.2,"Brown, tea-like appearance. Cherry and oak influence on the nose. Medium bodied with healthy tension between the Belgian yeast and the scotch ale makes this completely unique. Some plum and fig kick in on the back of the palate and into the finish.","Washington, USA","Aml42000"
2336,"2012-06-13",3.1,"750ml from Chucks. I dunno. I guess Im kind of cheesed at the fact it is $22.59 for a bottle. No traces of the scotch ale present, yet also not quite as tart as Id like. The 10%ABV packs a wallop, so thats nice. Reminds me of red wine more than anything else.","Washington, USA","killjoy966"
