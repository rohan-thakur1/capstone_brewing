1527,"2017-02-05",3.4,"Alright, so I got this as a gift for my 48th birthday and the label (and logo) were so abstract I couldnt even tell what it was. Its listed here as a ""Wheat Ale"" but when I popped and poured I could swear it was a DIPA. Huge pine resin aroma with a blast of florals and raw alcohol, it poured with a thick, hazy copper body with a slow, rocky head. Yet for all the fight that affronted my nostrils, the flavor was actually a bit tame with grasses, herbals, peppers and pines almost flatlining against its wheaty malt base and latent fruitiness. I questioned whether this was ""balance"" or a ""washout"", yet I didnt stop drinking it. I think a casual drinker will enjoy its surprises while a hop-head might say, ""meh"". Me? Im happy to have tried it! ~~~~ 500ml bottle, as a gift from my good friend Danno, thanks!","Oak Lawn, Illinois, USA","frankenkitty"

1527,"2016-09-05",3.5,"500 ml bottle shared at Jasons. A rich malty fruity double IPA in taste. This one comes off as too malty for me.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"

Pineapple, mango, papaya, and some orange and peach. A bit of caramel as well. Flavor is orange juice, mango, papaya, wheat, peach, a bit of caramel and bread. Kinda thick and pretty sticky and lingering. Very nice beer.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Thechasm442"
1527,"2016-03-31",3.2,"Bottle (500ml?). Color is a dark red, looks like a sour brown. Aroma is fruit and hops. Taste is lots of sweet juicy tropical fruit, but comes off in more of a candy form, like if you mixed a handful of different tropical fruit jelly bellies at once. Slight bitterness. Decent and unique.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"

1527,"2015-10-09",3.8,"Binnys in Lakeview: Pours hazy copper amber type color with a nice white head. Aroma is tea, tons of tropical fruit, like mango and passionfruit. Taste is lightly bitter at the top, then goes into a real strong tea flavor and finishes off as a medium bitter, fruity DIPA. Nice phases. Interesting aftertaste that is a strange combination of the tea and the fruitiness.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
1527,"2015-08-12",3.7,"Dark orange pour from bottle at home. Nice spicy and fruity aroma. Tastes like a pale ale , hoppy with a somewhat bitter finish. Nice citrus notes. Pleasant beer for sure","Chicago, Illinois, USA","kaser"
1527,"2015-07-26",4.4,"Tasted from a 500mL bottle. It poured a cloudy deep amber hue with a frothy beige head and plenty of lacing. It has the most amazing peachy aroma. Peach also comes through to accompany the nicely bitter hopped IPA taste. Marz Community Brewing has a definite winner here!","Illinois, USA","ChiGuy68"

1527,"2015-07-06",4.4,"Had it at Marias Community Bar, only one of the best establishments this side of Chi-Town. Pours a deep amber hue (also the name of an 80s porn star) with a lusciously intoxicating aroma rich of citrus notions. The taste is sweet, but not to sweet, subtle, yet bold with hops at the same time, hard to believe but true. Reminding me of a sultry lover that knows when to begin the beguine.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pablo951"
1527,"2015-05-16",4.1,"500-ml bottle from wlvliquors. hazy dark orange-amber, good head, good body, grapefruit nose, orange-grapefruit hops.","Illinois, USA","zebra"
1527,"2015-05-14",3.6,"500 mL bottle. Pours a hazy, deep orangey-gold honey color, medium, off-white head with okay retention. Nose is fruity hops, and cakey malts, chock full of citrus, melon, fresh strawberries, clover honey. Mouth is medium bodied, kinda sticky, medium sweetness, and pretty much all the characters from the nose playing along on a crackery malt-backed stage. Nicely balanced overall with a bit of warmth from the ABV at the finish. Yay Bridgeport! Oh yeah... and eat it Joakim, you punk assed bitch! Lebron owns you.","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"
