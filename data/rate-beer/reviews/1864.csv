1864,"2008-08-15",3.0,"Bottle. High white creamy lasting head. Hazy amber body. Weak malty aroma with fruity notes. Mild barley malt flavor with notes of pepper and relatively dry hops leaving a good deal of bitterness in the long aftertaste. Low carbonation.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Skinnyviking"
1864,"2008-08-11",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
This Heller Bock sports well-developed sweet cereals that lead to an intelligent grassy hop grip in a wealthy, approachable vehicle.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A thick head of foam covers the cloudy amber-tinged blond.
-This had a bigger body than I expected. I find it a tad too malty to be überdrinkable and perhaps not complex enough to be a sipper.
-A light alcohol presence surprises.
-An undefined fruitiness follows the mildly honeyed, direct cereal sweetness.

1864,"2008-05-21",3.7,"Bottle 100 cl. [Courtesy of Hildigöltur, thanks buddy] Large bubbly and creamy off-white head that mostly lasted. Good display of lacework. Cloudy amber color. Aroma of bread, dusty grain, toasted malt, hint of alcohol. Over the palate came mild fruit, toffee, and hint of floral. Pretty hoppy for a Heller Bock. Medium bodied with an average carbonation and mild dry texture. Moderated sweet and bitter in a great symphony. Bread like and hoppy lingering finish. Excellent and properly one of the best Heller Bock so far even it might not be true to the Heller Bock Style.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Grovlam"
