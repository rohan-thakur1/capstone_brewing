4254,"2016-06-01",3.5,"0.375 l bottle from De Bierkoning, bottled in March 2016. Clear, deep ruby with a large, fluffy, rather quickly collapsing, pinkish head. Sourish-fruity, somewhat musty aroma of cherries, bitter almond, some cellar notes, straw and hints of oak. Moderately sour, fruity and a little musty taste of cherries, bitter almond, oak, straw dank cellar and a touch of raspberries, followed by a medium long, moderately tart, slightly vinous, oaky finish. Medium body, moderately astringent and quite effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Refreshing and easy to drink, but I dont really like that cellar note in here. This brewery still cannot totally convince me.","Hagen / Bonn, GERMANY","Zlotta"

4254,"2015-03-12",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 19, 2015 Courtesy of tderoeck at this years ACBF, shared with tderoeck and 77ships. First batch of a limitedly produced old school kriek on oud bruin, apparently only 250 bottles were made this time. Allegedly a resurrection of a similar beer having been brewed in the municipality of Lo-Reninge till 1963, where the southern part of Flanders still had a tradition of Flemish red with sour cherries, a tradition which has gone all but lost (Verhaeghe Echt Kriekenbier is among the last of the classic ones still produced). Off-white, loose and thin head, cloudy bronze colour with ruby hue; very fruity and estery aroma, sour cherries indeed, passion fruit, yoghurt, tannins, dry sherry, hints of caramel. This is reflected in the taste: utterly fruity, sour cherry flesh but stonefruit tannins as well, honeyish malt sweetness in the background, drying tartness reinforced with oaky tannins in the finish, long and genuine. Body is on the thin side though. Nevertheless: respect for bringing new life to this disappearing tradition.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
4254,"2015-03-12",3.8,"Bottle, shared by tderoeck on a train Ghent-Vichte direction ACBF (Belgium). Thank you Tim! Pours hazy dark-red color, with some traces of a non-foam on the surface. Nose: cherries blast (very balanced tough), cellar. Mouth: peculiar fresh lambic beer, medium tart palate, fruity character. Lovely one (and rare). Again thank you Tim.","Rome, ITALY","ippopotamo36"
4254,"2015-03-08",3.4,"Thanks for this apparent rarity tderoeck! 750 ml. bottle sampled @ ACBF 2015. Bottled on 08/02/2014. Dark red, little head. Nose is thick yoghurt, lactic, overripe berries, krieken, plenty of sugar. Taste is similar, yoghurt overripe krieken, touch old and moldy, sugar, Thick sugar body. Doesnt fully work, maybe better fresh? Nowhere near as nice as their Oud Bruin.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

Very cloudy, blood red with a small pinkish white head. Wheat aroma with sour cherry, some light pickle and sourdough yeastpistachio and oak. Taste maybe is a bit too sweet.
