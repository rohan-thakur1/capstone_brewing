1593,"2014-11-07",3.2,"06.11.2014, 0,375l bottle (batch #9) sampled @ BBGTC tasting:
Masses of sediments, looks like watery rice milk. Aroma is strange, in a good way; kind of sweet sour-ish milky, hay, nuts, brie cheese, coconut milk, grass, alcohol, butter. Taste is slightly medical dry, harsh grass, medicine, minerals, alcohol, wet hay, yeast, rice, paper. Slightly dry and mineraly watery mouthfeel, mild carbonation. Fair enough. Quite interesting though...","Loddefjord, NORWAY","Inbreak"

Aroma is lactic-like sour tones, walnuts, coconut milk, alcohol and hints of pepper and pears far in the back. Taste is blue cheese, coconut milk, sour lactic-like tones, hints of nuts and medicinal alcohol. Carbonated, actually with palpable chunks of sediments.

1593,"2011-03-28",3.2,"Bottle shared at The Trappist.  Looks like glue, more or less, rather milky and chunky.  This is not out of the ordinary for this style though.  Nice aroma, with coconut, rice pudding, and citrus.  The flavor has a nice coconut essence with sweet rice pudding, lemon, and alcohol.

1593,"2010-11-01",3.0,"Bottle. It doesnt look very nice, with its yellowish milky body with lots of chunks. Fortunately the aroma and flavor are much better. Theres a hint of cellar in the aroma, as well as fruit-schnaps and some rice. Not much rice aroma or flavor, both are more on the fruity side and with the alcohol sure playing a significant role. Its full-bodied, warming, chunky and quite dry on the palate, some co2 too. Dry finish. A quite nice and tasteful one, but it looks bad. 100611","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

1593,"2010-06-01",2.2,"Bottle at Haandverkerstuene, Oslo.  Nihonshudo: -3, Seimaibuai 70%.
Almost explosive, extremely fizzy. Pours vailla-coloured with white lumps. Not the most delicate nigori sake I have seen. That said, the aroma has some nice herbal character, though also quite yeasty and extremely alcoholic. Some refreshing acidity, hints of herbs, undermined by overwhelming alcohol. Ends quite dry. The big lumps are not particularly pleasant in the mouth either, in my opinion, a far cry from a milky, smooth nigori. Maybe I had a bad bottle; it seemed well into the next stage of fermentation. What a waste of 25 euro...","Oslo, NORWAY","thebeertourist"
