3529,"2013-07-25",3.8,"Half-pint of cask at the Jolly Crispin while on the RB Black Country Bash 6th July 2013. Good looking brew, Ruby coloured with a full and rich light tan foaming head. Nose was chocolate malts and dark fruits. 

The taste was also chocolate and dark fruits with other malty notes like caramel and toffee. It wasnt however as sweet as those flavours might indicate: there was a bitter hop undertone throughout the half-pint.

My favourite new cask ale of the day: my sweet tooth really enjoyed this and I thought it different and almost on par with another Ruby Mild brewed just up the road!","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"
