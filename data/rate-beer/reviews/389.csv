The aroma is fruity with rice and alcohol, but less influenced by rice than the Junmai-shu, and it doesnt feel as warming as the Junmai-shu even though it has a higher ABV. It has a fruity flavor with some acididy, notes of rice, a hint of yellow apples and some alcohol. Full-bodied, dry and warming in the mouth, too warming actually, especially in the end. Some fruit and rice in the finish. A flavorful and quite nice sake, but too warming to be pleasant to drink. 100611","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

From 350 ml bottle at Olympen (may I suggest smaller bottles, for instance 18 cl ( 1go), since this sake is likely to be sold mostly via bars). Clear, hints of pale straw colour. Fruity and yeasty aroma. Yellow apples aroma. Apples, alcohol, quite dry finish with hints of cedar wood. Warming alcohol. Drier than expected from the low nihonshu-do. Good complexity. Quite full-bodied, a bit oily. No compromises from Nøgne Ø when it comes to sake brewing either. Rare rice types, a high rice polishing ratio (though not ginjo grade) and no brewers alcohol added. The result is very promising; I am really looking forward to batch no 002. Way to go, Hadaka Jima!","Oslo, NORWAY","thebeertourist"
