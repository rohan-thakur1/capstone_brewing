1046,"2015-08-18",3.9,"375ml bottle, ¿ Vintage, kindly shared by bursprak to the Aarhus Belgisk Blåmuslinger Tasting, 08/2015. - Finale to three big & bold postprandial closers to a nicely balanced tasting, this PoMo beer liqueur brings an elegant density of roast and black malt flavours into balance with the avantgarde of hop engineering: thick, destilled espresso and dark chocolate, orangeat, Grand Manier doused fondant over dried raisins, plums and DK-ubiquitous lakrids aka liquorice. Cognac-like alcohol never becomes sharply piercing, oozing prominently underneath the molasses. Hop bouquet subtleties stealthily flying under the dark surface: orange zest, berry, grape, citrus pith. Sticky, coating mouthfeel, without becoming sweet treacle. - Would be interesting to taste this parallel to some of De Struises more heavy hitters and compare the merits of clean engineering vs sugar-powered yeasts & eisbocking.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

1046,"2015-02-27",4.8,"(Vintage 2013. 37.5 cl) Un liquide à la robe presque noire qui tombe dans mon verre et qui montre une viscosité certaine. Un petit col brun qui flotte pour quelques minutes. Le nez de cet impérial est richement décoré par le chocolat, la mélasse, la vanille, les fruits liquoreux et charnus, les malts enfumés et noirs, la réglisse, les oranges confites, les aiguilles de pin, le café et bien dautres choses. Des arômes qui sont pour le moins extrêmement complexes et qui, par cette superbe représentation, atteignent facilement ici le degré dit de «la perfection». Sur les papilles, cest la très grande joie. Lexpérience est grandiose et le choc, ravissant. Les saveurs noires sont fantastiquement fruitées. Ça va du raisin à la prune en passant par lorange et le citron. Les malts fournissent des appuis chocolatés riches mais contrôlés. Les notes mélangées de mélasse, de vanille, de houblons et de réglisse complimentent ma langue à chaque lampée. Ce tout est fantastique. En bouche, le liquide est liquoreux, faiblement collant, doucement remué par les bulles, habilement construit, très soyeux, velouté à souhait, complètement satiné, raffiné, plantureux.

1046,"2015-02-21",4.2,"375 ml bottle, 2013 version, from Mikkeller Webshop.
Pitch black body, with an almost inexistent, tan head.
Aroma of melting chocolate, coffee, toffee, vanilla, quite a lot of alcohol.
Wonderful, intense taste of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, wood, nuts, caramel, subtle zesty hops, some dark fruits, a lot of booze, but not as much as I expected.
Full, oily mouthfeel, with a soft carbonation.
Finishes warming, alcoholic, astringent, bitter-sweet, quite dry, very complex, with smooth coffee, dark chocolate, wood, quite a lot zesty hops again.

Very tasty! Relatively smooth to drink for this extreme ABV. Very complex of course, more in the taste than the nose in my opinion. Loads of different, yummy malt notes, I also like the subtle hops a lot.
This is the most expensive bottle I bought so far and its really delicious, but still not my favourite Imperial Stout from Mikkeller, their (much cheaper) Brunch Weasel stands out for me. So overall a bit overpriced maybe, but still a pleasure to try once.","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"
1046,"2015-02-20",3.9,"2013 bottle. Pours thick black into a snifter. The little tiny bubbles take about 3 minutes to coalescealways a tense time. Nose is sweet, not as tar and molasses heavy as expected. A light meat-like savory note and something that keeps on saying ""pancake batter"". Makes me miss doing beer tastings. Despite all the heavy, sweet notes, the mouth really comes through with some interesting savory qualities -- well done bacon and salted meat mostly. Lots of maple syrup, marshmallow, ""fig stock"".  Finish becomes way too sugary. Body is very lightly carbonated, near flat. Doesnt bother me like it used to, though. As expected, it massive and too sweet, but it has some really interesting flavors going on. Not the legendary beer that I always thought the 2006 would be.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

Loaded with a thick chocolate backbone....syrupy, fudge, chocolate chips....then a nice dark fruit character that blends into a vanilla/oak harmony. Hints of tabacco, leather, cognac, earth, roast and a slight maple sweetness makes this one go down very easily for the abv. Extremely impressed with this big guy.

Super heavy nose of roasted malt with black licorice, dark loamy soil, moderate phenols (a hint of burnt plastic), and a milk chocolate tone to finish. Pours clear dark brown with faint bubbles at the edge of the glass. Initial sharp taste of licorice, rum, and mild dark chocolate before the complex flavor quickly smooths out, bringing forth notes of velvety fudge-covered brownies, a hint of raisins and dates, brown sugar, and cocoa powder. A brief whisper of red chili flake emerges late. Incredibly smooth, slick texture, with a heavy body thats skews toward medium. The larger variety of malts helps create a delightful layered taste.

Bottle... O-Town Pre-RBSG 07... This beer rocks!... Pitch black ale with a small, creamy, light brown head. Decent retention... ok, enough about the looks; lets dig in! First off, the ethanol wafting from the wide-rimmed glass stings my eyes as Im engulfed in an intoxicating, complex swirl of esters and phenols; malts and hops. A vinous, dark-spicy cloud surrounds me. Notes of port wine, tobacco, rawhide and smoked French oak with undertones of cocoa, horse blanket funk, dark raisins, dried plums and charcoal. The flavor make a U-Turn on the road toward complexity and instead, virtually screams chocolate, whiskey and hop bitterness. Overall  moderate lactic acidity, medium port sweetness and heavy, tannic, ashy bitterness. Full-bodied and velvety with adequate carbonation. Lengthy, astringent, almost-violently-bitter, bone-dry finish. Very, very warming! I tried, but couldnt describe my experience in fifty words or less.

Aroma is rich and complex with loads of molasses, red fruits, chocolate/fudge, vanilla, roasted malt, boozy notes and light soy sauce. Taste is also super rich, moderately sweet with again a ton of molasses, fudge, red fruits, vanilla, roasted malt and a warming finish. Full (!) body. Moderate carbonation. Thick and liquorous mouthfeel. Probably my favorite stout from Mikkeller (and one of my favorite stouts). Super rich, complex and warming. The alcohol isnt too much even at 16% abv. A great sipper!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Initial is firm and thicker bodied, rich cocoia and caramel, touches of nib, firm roast and dryness. Middle is fudgey, some firm dryness and roast, big nib character. A rich dryness and roast. Some nice flavors show some rich nib and dryness, roast and cocoa. Finish is really damn good, roasty and nib driven, coffee. Elements are rich and potent, but still work well together.

A very murky, dark brown pour with no head. Nose is huge and sweet raisins, heavy sultana/prune, a big oaky vanilla presence, liquorice, spice and milk chocolate. Quite sweet and juicy (dark fruits). Big spice reminding me of bourbon barreled RISs, stewed prunes and raisins - very juicy, brown sugar, vanilla, quite woody and ashy and a nice dose of currants. Drinks very well for the ABV but is a touch thin and sweet. Has a pleasing kick of booze on the finish. Probably too sweet but drinks decently. Kind of reminds me halfway between a big ass stout and a barley wine. A lot of dark fruit focus. I wouldnt be putting this in the top 50 beers on ratebeer but it should age quite gracefully.

1046,"2013-12-19",4.8,"UPDATED: MAY 28, 2014 Flaska. Delar med Isabel och avslutar födelsedagen. Hade glömt bort den här rackaren när jag dyker ner i källaren för att rota fram något att avsluta kvällen med. Minst ett topp-50 kryss lär man ju bocka av när man fyller år. Förväntningarna var dock inte så höga med tanke på att Mikkeller aldrig riktigt imponerat på mig på så vis att jag ramlat av stolen i häpnad av ölperfektion. Den här känns dessutom mest som en kul experimetbärs. Men ack så fel jag hade. Helt fantastisk och underbar. Förmodligen passade det perfekt med att vi redan druckit en hel del innan och trubbat av smaklökarna lite för alkoholen är inte det minsta spritig. Ovanligt mycket fikon och dadlar i doften. Smaken kan nog mest liknas vid flytande choklad och ren kakao. Blytung men samtidigt i bra balans. Påminner mig mest om Chocolate Rain men utan bourbon (Inte testat Black Tuesday ännu, troligen mer lik den då kanske). Ingen slurry. Tveklöst det bästa Mikkeller gjort. Och det vågar jag påstå eftersom jag testat allt från Mikkeller...


-----        
Rerate: Torkade frukter dominerar denna härliga imp-stout. Fin sötma i balans. Fikon, russin och dadlar. Tung och riktigt bra. Håller lätt många år till. Inga tecken till att ha åldrats.

Didnt really pick up much lacto there but it certainly comes through as an accent on the palate. Probably just as an accent because everything else is so big. Tar, chocolate, coffee, prunes, raisins, burnt toast, kitchen sink etc etc. Immensely rich but perhaps its the lacto that keeps it from being too much. If I have to pick a hole its probably thats its a little too sweet for my taste - personal preference only.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

The aroma is a monster shot of sugar, alcohol, and some earthy scents.  The appearance was deep black with a thin head.  Medium palate is creamy, but not quite as full as many other imperials out there.  The taste is just too damn sweet!  Over the top amount of sugar, with tastes of licorice, roasted malts, and floral aspects as well.  The taste is very complex to be sure--but that doesnt make this a beer I would want to drink on a regular basis at all.  The overpowering sweetness of this stout ruins the web of flavors that are being presented, and make what Im sure could be an interesting experience a hollow one.","Ohio, USA","thebaldwizard"

1046,"2007-05-07",4.2,"12 Oz Bottle shared by cquiroga. A funk of blue goat cheese, blueberries right from the canadian shield, and a musk of black malt. Im loving the lacto cheese character, while it could be construed as stinky. Pours deep black with a tan rim. More roquefort in the flavor, with tannic malt, cream, blackberry reduction and some roasted astringency. Ripe, is one word to use. An astounding 16% is lost amongst the sedimentary layers of inducing one too many angles of an Imperial Stout. Hops seems lost, despite profession from the bottle that the Pacific Northwest had a big influence. Its hard to climb over the mountain of funk that stamps this beer with its hard to achieve uniqueness. Dark rum clambors with balsamic for a final grapple to dominate a complex flavor profile. A long awaited and pleasently surprising opportunity to taste the enigmatic beast. Keep bringing it Danes!","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
1046,"2007-05-06",4.0,"From a 33cL Bottle.  Pours a viscous, oily black color with a thin layer of creamy tan head.  The aroma is intense.  Lots of sweet, sugary chocolate syrup, doused with molasses and anise, and fuming with a funky wave of rochefort cheese.  The lacto is very prominent and creates a bit of a pungent sensation when combined with the high alpha hops and noticeable alcohol content.  Everything is going on, and its all overwhelming to the senses.  Full bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel.  The flavors start out on the sweet side, brimming with more sugary chocolates and sweet molasses.  Rounding the corner, some notes of tobacco and well-trodden leather start to dry it up a bit.  At the finish, tons of funk and musty cheese are left lingering indefinitely on the palate.  As a reference point, this is what I would expect mephistopheles stout to taste like if it was aged in a barrel filled with gorgonzola cheese.  Theres just so much of everything going on, sticky malts, anise spice, leather, and some really funky cheese, my senses are met with more than their match.  I cower in the corner.

1046,"2007-02-25",4.8,"UPDATED: JUL 3, 2007 2 different bottles, both incredible. For almost fifteen years I have waited for a stout like this. Black pour with brilliant mahogany hues. A small but fervent head is totally resistant to diminishing. This looks like the inside of La Brea. A bouquet of varied anise scents lead in the aroma. Alcohol is very noticeable but somehow pleasing and cushiony. Sugar cane(Cachaca), rum raisin cake and a heaping of fresh cream. Really brutish nuances. Flavor is perfect, the first time Ive ever encountered the true meaning of the word. Cachaca and cream at first. Molasses that shows up next is confronting. Coconut cream mingles with alcohol and very bitter chocolate. The palate is gracious but unforgiving, completely full of vibrancy and as heavy as an anvil. Finishes roasty, chocolatey and without a complaint in the world from these lips. This is emminently complex, something to ponder over, which I suspect Ill be doing for many years to come. This is the most uncompromising and beautiful culinary delight I have ever had the pleasure of sampling. A near perfect stout. Maybe it is perfect, Ive certainly never had better.

1046,"2007-02-17",4.6,"Courtesy of Papsoe. The body is deep black and holds a huge; two fingers thick, mocha head that is so thick and lasting it almost looks like it is brooding. The aroma is a alcohol, chocolate and cane sugar. Its kind of muddy and a bit of a let down, but good enough to want to get to drinking it sooner rather than later. The fore is rich chocolate, massive burnt and roast bitterness, stewed dark fruits and a mélange of espresso blueberry liqueur and an oily coffee like acidity. This  is a great Imperial Stout from the first sip, but that sip then attacks with a burst of very unusual flavors I have never in this combinationmolasses, cane sugar, raisin liqueur, burnt rum and apples and raisins friend in rum. This beer tastes like what Avery Mephistopheles SHOULD have tasted like and the Mephistopheles was very good.  The mouthfeel is thick and round. The last sip seemed to have grains of raw cane sugar in it. It was that thick and coarse. I can truly say no beer I have ever had tastes like this. It tastes like a great Imperial Stout with a great experimental Imperial Stout tacked on to it. This beer must be made again for the sake of beer geekdom.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"

1046,"2006-12-31",4.4,"Black beer with medium-sized dark greige head. Alcoholic, very vinous nose; dry, resiny-hoppy, lupulin powder. Concentrated coffee, cacao, tobacco, dark chocolate, hops (and quite a lot , and very good ones, at that). Alcohol is there - unmistakably - but the complex flavours onslaught is such that nobody in his right mind would guess the truth. It is vinous but in away no wine could venture there - not anymore than a halberd-armed warrior could imagine himself the katana bearing samurai. Palate: are you kidding? this is the absolute zero Kelvin concentrate of dark matter, hidden in the black neutron star. The most surprising - and if anything, the real ""strength"" of this beer is that it is, without doubt, BEER. Nobody would mistake if for anything else, notwithstanding its overpowering strength.

Bouquet was so complex with an arrangement of pheromone that left you breathless for some minutes.just sniffing away, waiting for the initial first sip. Here it comes.wow talk about complexity in aroma. Initial thought was very vinous with notes of heavy malt and hops. Notes of dark candies, nutty, grapefruit, molasses, chocolate, coffee, dry fruit and smoke hits the taste buds. What a palate with a full bodied feel and an oily texture. Mouth is covered in oily from top to bottom in the most pleasing way imaginable. That said, there is still some dryness to be felt, especially at the end of a sip. Some where in there is the warmth of 16% alcohol, but you never really feel the alcohol, it is so well hidden. Carbonation is soft.

1046,"2006-12-06",4.7,"[Another century celebrated with a Mikkeller beer - this time 7200] Man, Ive been looking forward to sampling this beer again - ever since I tried first time draft at Københavnske Øldage in May 2006 - and now Im sipping a bottled version. The rating is a mixture of the two impressions.A pitch black beer with a lazing dark brown head. The aroma is very hoppy - like sticking your head in a hop vine in late August, but it also has notes of grapes, grass, grapefruit, and lesser notes of chocolate and oranges. The flavor is very powerful and very sweet, with notes of hops, brown sugar, grapefruit, chocolate, syrup, and lemon, toward the end a slight bret like acidity comes along. The end is roasted dry combined with a sharp citrus hop note. The mouthfeel is velvety soft, and the body very powerful, and the texture like syrup. This is the perfect sipping beer - Im going to contemplate the meaning of life while finishing this - and then Im going to have a healty and deep night of sleep. I want more even though I know it is impossible to remake.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
1046,"2006-12-04",4.7,"Draught. Black with enormous brown head. Aroma of pine, grass, clover, forrest and meadow. The flavour is full of a lot of the good stuff, I want in a beer like this and plenty more: pine, hops, sweetness, licorice, tobacco, dark fruits and warmth from the alcohol. Thick palate! I pleaded with Jeppe to get one more of these from him via mail, but the bastard brother of Mikkel never took notice! Now hes out my will and Mikkel and Keller will inherit all (if they can actually start a regular production of this baby!)","Amager (form. Nørrebro&Aalborg), DENMARK","MPA"

1046,"2006-11-08",4.6,"Bottled at Horsens Beerfestival. It looks as the original sin, topped off by a small brown head. The aroma is just wonderful, with chocolate, black tea, tobacco, alcohol, beef-stock notes and lots of hops. Not unbalanced though. It has a hint of sourness in the flavor, along with alcohol, chocolate, tea, mocha, hops and all things good. Full body with a drying sensation. It finishes off with alcohol, hops and coffee-bitterness. Theres also some lactic notes all the way, not to talk of the nice aromas and flavors from the hops. A wonderful beer that deserves a better faith than just beeing an experiment. Thx for the tasting Mikkel & Kristian. (061028)","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

Very intense stuff. Black in colour. Aroma is intensley hoppy. So much so there was little roasted malt to detect in the aroma as the hops dominated. Likewise for the palate, lots of grapefruit, piney hop characters, both sweet and bitter. The roasted malt characters seem to take a back seat here. Some alcohol noticed in the finish, but hey its a strong beer so i was expecting that. Would love to try this one again in the future.

1046,"2006-06-28",3.8,"Draught. Deep black with a soapy white/tan head. Wow, theres a crazy amount of hops in the aroma - all C citrus and enormously resiny. No noticeable alcohol right from the start. Smells like an IIPA in a lot of ways and there is some noticeable roast chalkiness. Now in terms of the flavour I was a bit torn because it wasnt really what I was expecting...it was immensely hoppy and sticky without a lot of the typical Imperial Stout characteristics that Ive come to love. Theres even some sourish roast malt but its all dwarfed by the grapefruity resin. Lacking in balance and sweet and bitter in the finish. One thing remains though - the alcohol is well masked.

1046,"2006-05-29",4.8,"Intens deepest brown to black colored beer with creamy brown froth. The beers looks extreemly dens and even the tears on the glass are colored in a nice warm brown. The aroma is hughe and very intens, it has a deep extract of the blackest of coffees, bitter chocolate, burned rubber on a F1 track, drop, blackend caramel, touches of laurell leafs, rosemary, thym, lemongrass, lime zest and yoghurt flowers. The taste is very powerfull, it is like a heavey reduced expresso with  the juse of a lemon poured into it. The accents of all sorts of coffees, cocoa, bitter chocolate, black tea, bitter burned caramel, violets, lellys, and burned edges of a caramelized apple cake are detectable. All this is well countered with a very sexy sournes that works wonderwell with the very complex selection of hops. The balance between the bitters, the acides and the roasted touches in the crazy brew are well in composition. The more suptile accents of fresh herbs and mint are comming up in the finale.

Roasted aroma of coffee, liquorice, hops and pine needles.
Roasted flavour of coffee, liquorice, hops and pine needles.
Reminds me of Dogfish Head World Wide Stout 18 %, but this one is much more hoppy.
In my opinion, this one is a bit too sweet and hoppy but lacks some roasted notes, but its still a fantastic beer.","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","joergen"

1046,"2006-05-25",4.6,"(Draught at Københavnske Øldage). This is a BIG beer. The arome comes at you with a big, grassy and nutty, slightly sour and spicy dry-hop character very much like Orval. Flavor is huge with an apparent warming alcohol body that carries tones of caramel and licorice. You dont gulp this one down. Despite the big taste, it is very palatable and surprisingly balanced. Some might think it is too hoppy, but I like it.","Mölndal, SWEDEN","Gusgus"

Also prunes, tar, tobacco, coffee, chocolate, whiskey and, of course, alcohol. Full bodied like bricks. Very bitter finish with a warming alcohol sensation all the way down into your guts.

1046,"2006-05-22",5.0,"UPDATED: SEP 12, 2006 Draught at Københavnske Øldage 2006.
Looks like a perfectly made espresso; black and with a dark brown head.
The aroma is an explosion of espresso, notes of grapefruit from the American hops, tobacco, red and black fruits, dark chocolate, smoke and noticeable alcohol.

On the palate it is full-bodied to say the least; its actually massive beyond description. But even though there is quite a lot of sweetness, it never gets cloying, as the alcohol and the acidity from the roasted malts and the lactobacillus adds the balance.

A superb beer that belongs among the fines brews Ive ever had.

090906; bottled. The aroma and taste has developed even further.
Now the bretty horseblanket aromas from the lambic yeast are dominating more adding even more complexity to this fantastic beer. The aftertaste lasts for more than a minute. Once again a perfect score. Thanks Mikkel and Keller for opening this one of only 25 bottles of this brew.","Køge, DENMARK","Belgo"
