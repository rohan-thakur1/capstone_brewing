1689,"2012-10-06",4.3,"Had on tap at Piece. Served in a 22 oz. Hefe glass.

A: Pours a very chilled and hazy dark straw that bubbles to a very light brown at the body of the glass. A fluffy, pure white head forms on the pour, about one finger in height, that stick with me down the entire glass. Splotches of lace follow me down the glass. Looks perfect.

S: Great notes of wheat, clove, peppery yeast and a subtle bubblegum.

T: The taste follows the nose, but there is a little bit more peppery yeast bite with a little less sweet bubblegum. The wheat becomes more prevalent as well with a slight malt character.

M: Medium bodied, but leaning towards the lighter side. Little coating quality that really lets the yeast resonate in your mouth.

O: Its obvious why this beer has won multiple awards. Its very delicious and I would have again and again. All the characteristics in the taste really mesh well.

Aroma was heavy on clove, banana, a bit of citrus and some orange or other citrus.  Beautiful cloudy and brilliant orangish yellow color.  Lots of thick white head and lacing.  Taste perfectly matched the aroma and had lots of flavor packed into each sip.  Gorgeous taste.  Very little bitterness with some grassiness.

1689,"2011-08-02",3.6,"On tap at Piece in Chicago. This was a surprising and solid example of a standard German hefe. To me, they didnt take a lot of risks with this one, but not to their detriment. On the pour, some light and fluffy pillowy white head that coats the glass well, and a hazy golden yellow colored body. Nice fruity bananas, mellow wheat, reserved clove spice, and some other mixed fruits in the aroma. A medium-light feel, and not as thick and bready as some hefes can be. Again, conservative notes that are standard yet high on quality. Big bananas, clove spice, wheat dinner rolls, and mixed estery fruit. This was nice.

1689,"2007-10-09",4.0,"On tap at Piece Brewery, and served in a tall weizen glass.  This beer poured a hazy, bright golden amber color with a small, white head that quickly faded away,  Not much lace.  The aroma of the beer was made up of very strong notes of bubblegum, fruity banana esthers, and also a bit of clove.  Very appealing!  The flavor did not disappoint either.  The strong notes of bubblegum and banana came to the forefront, but were not cloying or overpowering.  Beautifully balanced.  The mouthfeel was crisp and medium-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation.  I really loved this beer.  In my opinion, a hefeweizen cant be done much better that this!

After several barrel aged imperial stouts (in 90+ degree heat) I was ready for something lighter and more palatable.  While those were worth the cost of admission it was just too hot to continue to drink them by the halfway point.  This was a great change of pace - Piece is currently one of my favorite brewpubs.  I wouldnt be too disappointed if it were the local one at all.
Aroma / Appearance - The cloudy yellow body did not let much light escape.  As it swirled around the poor designed kolsch glass I saw a bit of white head form.  The nose is mostly banana but not intensely so.
Flavor / Palate - The taste was pretty simple and clean, just as I was hoping.  Banana and yeasty notes formed the bulk but somewhere in there was a little spiciness.  This was a very well made hefeweizen which is perfect for days like the GTMW.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Theres a strong, sweet banana presence and light cloves with a little bit of wood in the aroma. Nicely rich and refreshing in the way of flavor. Sweet banana, yeasty flavors and a tasty spiced note hit the palate up front, but it doesnt finish quite as juicy. The brew falls on a papery, husky flavor. Pretty nice though.

Flavor unfolds from the aroma, drawing out tart traits and a well-balanced sweetness.  Effervescent.  Creamy, like an orange smoothie paired with fresh squeezed lemons; however, the spotlight is on a standard cast of bready characteristics, similar to sourdough bread, along with a well-executed spiciness of cloves and pepper.

Thick, rich and tasty!Earlier Rating: 4/6/2003 Total Score: 4.5Move over Oberon, here is my new favorite American Wheat!!!   Piece Pizza is a peculiar spot in the mixed up Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago.  The cast of MTVs Real World worked here, the decor is mostly Cheap Trick photos and guitars, and the pizza isn't Chicago- style, but East Coast old school thin crust with a wide variety of toppings and sauces.  Back to the beer,  this bright yellow/gold and cloudy Hefe is a beauty to behold (and served in a great weisse glass that needs to be printed with their quirky logo!).  The nose is fruity, mostly banana, clovey, wheaty, cereal like, fresh, inviting.  The beer is thick, but not overly so.  The body is stout enough for big beer lovers like me, but can easily  be sessioned on a hot Summer day.  Huge fruity esters, massive banana floats, clove dust, and vanilla are all wonderful..
