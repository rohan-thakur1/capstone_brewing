2873,"2017-05-12",4.1,"Bottle, from SlovakSniper-- thanks Pat! Lovely violet hue that turns murky with the end of the pour. Berries and funk on the nose. Pleasantly tart palate, not a puckering tartness, but rounded and soft. Genuine ripe berry fruit and light funk and oak, light seedy tannins. This could play as either an elegant fruit beer or a fruited saison, as both characters wrestle in a draw. Very lovely.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

2873,"2017-03-28",4.2,"Bottle split with the extended family. Hill Farmstead knows how to make a funky beer that smells incredible. This has that Brett and barnyard smell that is immediately recognizable as a HF bottle. The flavor starts off with those funky, earthy, effervescent notes, but is quickly overrun by a lot of fruits, which tempers the sourness but gives it just a little too much sweetness for my taste. Still -- extremely good stuff.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

2873,"2016-06-08",4.6,"375mL bottle shared by Nelson on 6/3/16, thanks!Magnificent, deep, bright, blood red and violet color shows a high clarity and a magenta-tinted, white head atop with moderate to low retention.Berry skins/tannins and restrained funk in the nose complement each other nicely. Very complex and understated, as always, with very mild lactic notes and brett, as well, lying behind the vibrant fruitiness. Hints of vanilla and biscuit from the malt but this is certainly a fruit and yeast/bacteria show. No alcohol or flaws.Ive found a majority of the best fruit beers to have aromatics that outdo the actual fruit flavor. Not the case here, much to my delight (and not taking anything away from the nose, which is absolutely fantastic). Tart, tannic, acidic and at times, poignantly sweet, the complex berry notes are deftly woven in with the bacterial/yeast acids while the wood helps soften things but is otherwise very light. Gentle funk for days, with low but tight carbonation and a high level of dryness overall. Add to this a frightening drinkability and Id put this right up there as one of the best fruited sours Ive ever had.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2873,"2016-02-05",3.9,"This bottle was poured by JesusofVT. I did not tell him that I have recommended people hotbox his shitters but I did tell him to try some Ganstaller which he ignored. Reddish violet appearance with a pinkish tan head. Aroma has plenty of berries - blackberries and raspberries, especially. Some funk and acid noticeable. Good carbonation. Low sweetness and bitterness. Moderately tart. The flavor has blueberries and blackberries, oak, vanilla, and a bit of lemon citrus. Good and easy to drink but I think these fruit variants of Flora really lose some complexity and become a bit more homogenous with the fruit addition. Its a good beer - just not a great beer like Flora.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"

2873,"2016-01-17",4.2,"375ml bottle. Pours a bright fuchsia color, small fizzy white head fades to a ring with some spotty lacing. Aromas are tart berries galore! Lots of blueberry/raspberry interplay. Funky oak, wet basement, cobweb. Taste showcases a really nice balance of the fruit. The black currant is more noticeable here than in the nose. Blueberry pucker and raspberry funk....currants hold the middle with sweetness. Very clean mouthfeel, semi-dry with lots of fruit presence shining in the finish without being acidic. Really solid offering and one of my favorite Flora variants.","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"

2873,"2015-12-26",3.6,"375 mL bottle. Deep red. Looks like cranberry juice. Smells strongly of dark berries. A touch vegetal. Someone described it as gin, which is apt. Tastes of berries. Sour blueberry and blackberry, even though I know thats not one of the fruits. Light white wine. Low carbonation. That vegetal flavor comes through a lot as it warms.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

Underdeveloped fruit flavor, everything stands apart. Reduced berry sensation with some oxidative qualities. Lambrusco like with its overcooked tannic sensation. Loose acidic palate, either definitively too thin, or it needs time to round out.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

2873,"2015-12-20",4.6,"375ml bottle at the tasting room and later at home that night in a HF tulip. Pours deep purple with a nice pinkish head. Aroma of amazing berries, a nice tartness, some light funk maybe from the fruits?, hints of wine/oak, and some light malts. Flavor mainly dominated by the strong fruits and sourness, but in a great way. Nice HF saison texture. An incredible beer with pretty much no flaws.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
2873,"2015-12-20",4.0,"375ML Bottle acquired @ Hill Farmstead 2 weeks ago. Stored @ fridge temp and poured carefully into a single stemmed glass.

A - Very faint CO2 sound when the cap was popped. No head formed on the pour. The beer itself is nothing short of beautiful. Its the most blood red, gorgeous beer that seems to be a trifecta culmination of 3 fruits that home brewers know make beautiful beers. Blueberry seems to be the dominant coloring agent.

S - It certainly smells like Flora. Wine barrel, acid, tannins, oak, grapes, a hint of mint and a bursting bouquet of fruits.

T - The taste itself, its overloaded with fruit. Raspberry is up front with a sharp acidic currant at the finish. Blueberry unsurprisingly is not blossoming but thats standard for blueberry beers. Good tartness with being overwhelming but the base beers flavor doesnt appear to be blowing up in a huge way. Its rather consistently tart and complimentary to the fruits.

M - Mouthfeel is thin, theres some faint carbonation which almost certainly will increase with time and I certainly will be patient and allow this beer to keep carbonating in the bottle for another year or two.

O - This beer is fantastic but it also has this interesting identity crisis with so many fruits all fighting for attention and a lower carb that is very much not like any other iteration of Flora. Still, fantastic but if youre trading for this to split it 10 ways, dont. Its a 2-person bottle at most. It really needs to be enjoyed as it warms and opens up.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
2873,"2015-12-20",4.5,"First of my bottles. Pour looks like cranberry juice - a pretty dark fuschia with very little pink head. Mouthfeel lacks much carbonation but is smooth. Smells like fruit salad - the berries really stand out. In the flavor the berries and currants are unmistakable. Tart but not too sour. Im still getting the nice easy drinking of the base Flora. Overall I love this. Keg please, HFS? (Kidding).","New Hampshire, USA","Heather_B"
2873,"2015-12-14",4.3,"Bottle. Pours plum purple with pinkish purple head. Got scared with this de Garde looking beer but the smell and taste arent gross and overly acidic. Cheers to that. Aroma is tons of floral, perfume, potpouri, blueberry, and raspberry. Light to medium body. Flavor is pretty sour for a Hill, notes of raspberry, red wine, and blueberry skins. Very nice.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
2873,"2015-12-11",4.3,"375ml bottle from the brewery. Aroma: insanely good berries aroma with predominant raspberries but also good touch of black currant. Blueberries are a bit less present to me. Nose reminds me a good fruity lambic. App: dark pink purple-ish, minimal pink head, little retention but as anyways from them, there is lacing. Taste and palate: light body, medium sweetness but really soft and so well blended with the medium high lingering acidity finish. Overall: great stuff! Got a few more so will sure keep some to age them a bit and see how it turns. But as it right now I really really like it. Great acidity in the cheeks which gives a good dry touch.","St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Stoned99"
