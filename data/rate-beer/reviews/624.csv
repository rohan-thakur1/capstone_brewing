624,"2017-05-21",4.3,"This really was excellent, and to think that were drinking beers of this quality, these days, from a can. (Well, in truth, I did pour mine into a glass.) Excellent, robust chocolate and some coffee, though it wasnt obvious / banging me over the head that this was a coffee beer. Rich, smooth palate. Good head, lasting, dark cream-to-tan color. Very fine beer. Can.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
624,"2017-03-27",4.3,"This Stout is masterful in its balance. The lactose sugary richness adds a lovely layer of sweetness to offset the bright, roasty bitterness of the coffee flavors. The fresh coffee is the star, but theres a pleasantly creamy feel and a subtle dessert-like cocoa/vanilla quality. This seems to fit the ideal for lovers of both Sweet Stouts and coffee - thats actually not that simple to pull of, which makes this successful effort even more impressive.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"
624,"2017-02-27",4.3,"Can/Fest,

A- Coffee, espresso, dark chocolate, roasty.

A- Black color, black liquid, light brown head.

T- Black coffee, subtle cocoa, roasty, mild bitterness.

P- Full body, average texture, average carbonation, roasty finish.

O- Actually not sweet at all. Id say this is more like an Imperial Stout. Regardless of how its filed, its a really tasty beer. This is like drinking straight coffee or espresso. All around a simple and pure coffee stout.","Ravenna, Nebraska, USA","HuskerTan"
624,"2017-02-11",3.6,"On tap at Pizza Luce Downtown. Pours near black with a creamy dark brown head that dissipates to the edges and laces. Aroma has creamy earthy dark grains pairing with coffee notes. Flavor starts with sweet and earthy dark grains with coffee, wood and a light creaminess supporting.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
624,"2017-02-09",3.9,"Can into a taster showing pitch black with half a finger of latte colored foam. 

The nose shows a lot of sweet caramel latte. 

The palate is full bodied and lightly carbonated but smooth. Flavors of latte with an espresso bitterness. Not bad.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"
624,"2017-02-09",4.3,"Can shared by jc1762. Thanks man!

 Dark brown body with an oily, beige head. Aromas of coffee, roast, chocolate. Milky notes shine through in the flavor. Cold brew coffee in beer format. Delicious.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
624,"2017-01-14",3.9,"16 oz can. Black with a light brown head. Mocha - earthy roasted coffee and heavy cream, and roasted malt aromas. Brown sugar sweetness with a big coffee bitter finish. Heavier body with a creamy feel. One of my favorites from Summit.","St Paul, Minnesota, USA","Nsanders"
624,"2017-01-10",4.1,"Nice dark look. Has a nice toast coffee malt aroma. Taste is a good roast malt with some coffee and cream. Silky body, Good beer.","Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, USA","Nejhleader"
624,"2017-01-03",3.9,"Picked up a single 6-oz can from Heritage Liquors in Maplewood, Minnesota. Pours an opaque dark brown colored bow with a creamy beige head that has excellent retention and lacing. Aroma of mocha coffee, a hint of marshmallow, roasted almonds, and floral hops. Taste is medium to full bodied, flavors of lactose, coffee, dark chocolate, formal hops and a touch of roasted almonds. Finish is smooth, semi-sweet with a nice balanced mocha coffee and almond aftertaste.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
624,"2016-12-28",3.5,"Poured a medium brown with a beige head. Aroma was of darl roasted coffee, pretty much it. Flavor similar, not really too exciting, but an easy drinker.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
624,"2016-12-19",3.9,"Can. Perfectly black colored body with a dense light brown colored head. Nose of rich dark chocolate and coffee. Prunes and some almonds are also present. Flavors of smooth coffee and raisins are up front. There is also some milk chocolate and hints of a nutty character. The body is highly carbonated but still pleasant to drink. One the best smoothest coffee stouts I have tried.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
624,"2016-12-15",4.6,"Outstanding sweet stout! Very well crafted with just the right amount of roast to balance the sweet. Excellent finish.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"
624,"2016-12-12",3.7,"Tap at republic 7 corners with commonmac. Snifter type glass. 12oz pour. Black with thick tan head. Roasted nutty nose. Coffee, then roast, crisper finish. Medium body, slightly thin for the style. Not a ton of depth of flavor. Decently done.","Minnesota, USA","commonshawn"
624,"2016-11-29",4.6,"Black and completely opaque, even with a strong backlight. 1/2 inch tan, thick head receding slowly leaving a thick lacing. Aroma of dark roasted coffee, fruit, vanilla, and others for an enjoyable, complex smell. Mild and malty initial taste, with the coffee flavor quite evident (but not overpowering at all), vanilla, dark fruits, roasty, with just enough balancing bittering in the late middle to the finish and aftertaste. Enjoyable dryness to the finish. Sweetness from the malts are there, but just enough for a nicely balanced malty beer. Substantial to thick mouth feel, very smooth. Despite the ABV, easy drinking and no booziness at all. Excellent. (But beware of that ABV, cause youll want to have several of these...)","Minnesota, USA","MNAle"
624,"2016-11-26",3.8,"Pour out of 16 oz can, dark black pour with tan head, aroma brought notes of dark cocoa, roast, nice iced coffee into a bit of dark fruit, some slight smoke. Taste was a nice mix of cocoa, roast, coffee, espresso bean into a bit of earth, spice, some dark fruits, finishing slightly sweet, slightly bitter.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
624,"2016-11-26",3.6,"16 ounce can. Pours a pitch black color with a medium beige head. A huge coffee and vanilla nose. Huge coffee, vanilla, light roast, some light tobacco. Pretty good. Coffee forward beers arent really my thing, but this is good.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
624,"2016-11-18",3.7,"From a can. Black beer and a very dark, milk chocolate covered head. I poured this aggressively into a 1/2 liter mug and regretted it, lots of carbonation that overflowed before the pour was finished. Aroma has a moderate amount of coffee. Flavor is of sweet cafe latte, malt syrup. Lower carbonation on the palate than I expected from the pour. Well balanced; the coffee wasnt necessary but it works well.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
624,"2016-11-12",4.0,"Can pours a dark brown/black with a huge tan brown head. Aroma of coffee roast, milk chocolate, and molasses. Taste of sweet milk chocolate, lactose sugar, slick palate, flowing into roasted coffee and malts finishing with a light bitterness. Solid, tasty, and drinkable!!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
624,"2016-11-09",3.9,"Tap (Bulldog Lowertown); pours black with a tan head; aroma is dominated by roasted coffee with hints of milk and wood; taste is bittersweet coffee with hints of roasted malts, milk, and wood; finish is bitter coffee","Minnesota, USA","gopherfan99"
624,"2016-11-02",3.9,"Can. Black color with a large tan head. Sweet milky aroma wih some coffee and roast notes. Strong lactose flavor. A lot of yeasty esters, a bit like blueberries. Light roast. Coffee is fairly mellow, but is there. Seems like it blends in very well instead of coming across like a pint of cold press. Sweet finish, full body.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
