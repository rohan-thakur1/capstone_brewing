4233,"2017-05-25",3.4,"12 oz. bottle. Originally reviewed 2/7/2015.
Slightly hazy deep amber. Medium white head. Medium collar.
Smells like apple juice, but a little less sweet. A little bit of an earthy aroma.

Taste is an unsweetened apple flavor. Earthy maybe isnt the right descriptor anymore. Slightly acidic. Then the sweet apple juice kicks in. Finishes like apple juice. Medium body. Well carbonated.
Its pretty good, but apple just isnt an interesting enough fruit for me.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

The nose shows a distinct red apple aroma on top of a bed of earthy malts. 

The palate is highly carbonated and medium bodied. Very strong apple forward flavor throughout that increases until it reaches a sharply sweet apple note (think apple pie or jolly rancher) on the finish. Upon warming, caramel malts become more apparent and blend very well with the apples. Very nice finish and probably closer to a cider in my opinion but I cant really tell the difference.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"

Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, apples, and light earthy hop/spice notes; with great strength. Taste of big balanced sweet/tart apples, caramel, brown sugar, toasted bread, light cinnamon/spice, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate fruit tartness and light herbal/spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of sweet/tart apple, caramel, brown sugar, toasted bread, light cinnamon/spice, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, apples, and light earthy hop/spice notes; with a great malt/tart/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from the apple acidity as well. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/acidic, and slightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4%. Overall this is a fantastic fruit beer.

Flavor is phenomenal with notes of fresh apples, lots of residual sweetness and just a touch of tartness at the finish. The carbonation is what really makes this great-sharp and very fine with a pretty modest amount. This really makes the beer pop in your mouth and keeps it from feeling oil due to the high amount of sugars. Overall I wish I grabbed a few more bottles of this.

Sweet apples, mildly tart & raw, skins & flesh with hints of graham cracker, butter, cinnamon, much like an apple pie.

6/21/2010: New Glarus Apple Ale... Aroma: Wow, really unexpected, but good aroma of aged apple cider with hints of subtle spices and caramel; strong. Appearance: Cloudy honey color; thin, churning veil of off-white to beige-colored bubbles; lots of tiny carbonation bubbles exploding in all directions, churning their way to the top. Flavor: Quite sweet! Sugary apple, but the apple doesnt jump right out, it is more reserved with more sugary caramel coming through as well as some gentle spice, clover honey, and vanilla; more and more honey and creamy vanilla as the beer warms, also some cream sherry. Palate: Medium; slightly creamy, but slightly spritzer-like at the same time; soft. Overall: This beer has definitely changed over its life in the bottle, but it is surprisingly good and quite enjoyable!

6/21/2010: New Glarus Unplugged Apple Ale... Aroma: Apple juice. Appearance: Hazy golden color with a tinge of shiny copper; initial head of beige foam that dissipates to leave a thin veil with a ring around the edge; good level of rapid carbonation. Flavor: Light apple, slightly dull and dusty at times; sweeter in the middle through the finish; a small dollup of clover honey and vanilla caramel in the finish; floral undertones. Palate: Medium; airy and light mouthfeel. Overall: Very different characteristics as the older bottle, but still nearly as good; the apple doesnt overwhelm and therefore this comes across as BEER with some apple characteristics, not just like an apple cider; quite refreshing and easy to drink.

4233,"2013-06-13",3.4,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip.

Apple Ale looks like apple cider with a more robust head.  It is a caramel or dark golden orange color with a hazy effervescence.  The cap on top froths up suitably, eventually leaving a few wisps of a cap and a ring around the edge of the glass.

Tons of red apple notes in the aroma.  It smells sweet and again reminds me of apple cider.  There is a bit of a tart acidity that enters my nose as well.

The flavor is nearly spot on for sparkling apple cider.  The flavor starts with a burst of red apple skin and sugary apples, with only the tartness giving away any clue that this is not a cider.   A bit of white grape juice or white wine adds a little more character to the flavor.  Not much from the malt bill actually gets through, and there are certainly no hops present.

The crisp carbonation suits this beer well.  It has a light to medium body, and the sweetness from the flavor carries over into a sensation on the lips.

4233,"2012-11-27",4.4,"As any Wisconsin beer lover knows, New Glarus Thumbprint Series (formally known as Unplugged) are never guaranteed to appear again. But, Apple Ale is one of those brews that do keep showing up at the end of each year. In 2012 it was released a little later than the normal October release to accommodate the presence of Enigma already on store shelves. Apple Ale is one of the Thumbprint beers that always seem to be very plentiful, so be sure to pick yours up before its gone. 
It pours a semi-cloudy amber orange color with only a slight white head. The scent is fairly simple with that traditional ale scent mixed with sweet apples. While it does have a sweet apple aroma, it is still not as strong as hard ciders. Very inviting, like an adult juice box just waiting to be drank.
Yum! The sweet tartness of the apples attacks your taste buds right away. This years brew is perhaps a little better than I remember the previous years being. The texture is smooth and generously filling as it delivers fantastic blend of ale with apples. If you like hard ciders and want to make a step up to something a little tastier and filling, this is a good place to start. Sorry folks, but its not gluten free though. It finishes very clean with mild tartness. 
 This is one of beers that can take you back to your childhood as this is essentially a big kids version of apple juice. It makes for a great complimentary beverage for fall harvest meals before it becomes time for porters and stouts with winter approaching. Delicious tasting, well made, what else could you ask for?

A: Pours a solid amber color with a one finger height of white head forming on the pour. It recedes to a thin collar.

S: Green sour apple jolly ranchers are big on the nose. There is a sold malt undertone to it with some red apple sweetness.

T: A touch of jolly rancher up front, but it quickly gives way to a nice, bright red apple flesh with just a smidgen of raw apple skin. The finish is slightly mealy like an apple core thats been set out exposed to the air too long, but not in a bad way. The malt base gives it a touch of sweetness and a little heft to the body.

M: Medium to light bodied with a nice medium high carbonation level. The finish is malty and sweet.

O: Im glad the base brown ale malts still have some say in the taste and it doesnt come off as a cider. A nicely put together beer with the main focus being the apples. Definitely a nice fall treat.

4233,"2011-06-01",3.7,"bottle shared by murphym45 - one of the more controversial NG unplugged beers that my palate has experienced. sweet body, light sugar, sparkling cider almost. Caramelized apples, with a sour fruit note. Tasty, but the apple esters are a bit too strong so it winds up tasting almost artificial. A bit more subtly would do the trick here. Cant complain too much though, still delicious.","New York, New York, USA","zdk"

Pour into glass looks like a brown apple cider, with a noisy fizzy head. Taste is mostly apple cider, though the malt does give some backing to it. Pretty full of malt and juice, nicely fizzy, but it doesnt hang together as a great concoction. I like it enough, though.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
4233,"2011-05-26",3.4,"On tap.Wow, this is the first time Ive come across New Glarus Apple Ale in about 15 years. To find it on tap was a special treat.

Pours a clear pale gold with thin, bubbly head that doesnt add much to the appearance or lacing. Aroma is crisp fresh apples not unlike a cider, only with a stronger malt nose. Flavor is also similar to a hard cider with fresh, soft apple flavors (very much unlike the liquid Apple Jolly Rancher cooked up by Lindeman) but with a bit more filling malt and maybe a small dose of hops to remind you that this is actually beer. Clean, tingly, thirst-quenchingly moist palate with a good sweet red-apple finish. This is a very able thirst-quencher but not nearly as good as I remember it. (I also have to wonder if it would be rated so highly here if it had a label slapped on it from some middling brewery rather than a New Glarus label. Theres a very similar-tasting Belgian apple ale listed here thats rated almost a full point lower... hmm...) Maybe my memory has faded over the years but I remember some 15 years ago when New Glarus was just getting off the ground and you could find the Apple Ale year-round in 750ml bottles seemingly as a companion to the Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart, like the three formed their own miniature ""artisan fruit-beer"" series. I also remember the original Apple Ale being similarly unfiltered as the Tart and Belgian Red, looking almost like the unfiltered cider you find in gallon-jugs in the grocery store produce section when fall rolls around.. And for that matter, i also remember the original having quality-control issues as it was not uncommon to get a bottle that had turned. Maybe thats why its considerably more filtered than the original version. I wish they could do it the ""old"" way, but if they cant, this is a reasonable substitute.... but sadly, not as satisfying.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

Once popped, this beauty pours an ever so slightly cloudy, yet dominantly clear pumpkin orange with a soft, fluffy white gentle head that rests atop the beer and leaves spotty traces across the surface. After each sip, a wave of tightly bubbled lace rises and then falls, leaving a high-water mark of lacing. Nose is overwhelmingly Fuji  and Granny Smith apple tart mixed with graham cracker pie crust, fresh vanilla ice cream, carmelized honey, doughy yeast, and subtle notes of . Freshly baked, chunky tart apple pie filling and subtly roasty pie crust wash over the tongue, leaving behind notes of vanilla ice cream, cinnamon, and even some slight cherry in the finish. Soft, supple, yet tangy, slightly chewy palate with a spritely, lively body to enrich and enhance the tart apple and vanilla flavors. Finishes crisply, but with just enough juicy apple smoothness to make it perfectly balanced. New Glarus really work wonders with fruit.

Pours a light copper for with a minimal white head.and just a spot or two of lacing. Thin collar. Nose brings some cinnamon and other spices plus quite a bit of cider character. A bit odd, but I like it.

Flavor brings quite a bit of spools and some sweetness plus some nutmeg and other spices. A bit too sweet. Feel is prickly with a lot of carbonation. Overall, quite a unique beer but I really am enjoying this.

Not very beer-like, but the apple flavors are outstanding - red fruit, green fruit, ripe fruit, and bright fruit.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

This is much sweeter than I had desired, and the apples seemed to play a minor role.  When the apple flavor finally hit this beer is quite nice, but it is such a small part of this beer which resembles a watery apple juice to me.","Minnesota, USA","mattyb83"

Ar: Lots of apple, obviously.  Fall McIntosh and tart varieties dominate.  Perhaps a touch of caramel malt.
Ap: Pours a golden amber with streaks of orange.  Not  a ton of head, but brilliantly translucent.
T: Lots of apple sweetness on the front, but not much tartness.  This would be exponentially better with a bit tart punch.
P: Champagne-like carbonation.

O: I remember this being significantly better during the last vintage (2008?).  A big tart bite would have made this one great, but it just wasnt there.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","spilledpint"
4233,"2010-11-27",4.3,"Very good beer. It has a nice head that stays and pours a beautiful coppery-red color. The apple is very noticeable, both in the aroma and the flavor. Sweet apple flavor with some dry, malty undertones, this truly tastes like an apple beer, rather than a hard cider, which I think is a good thing. Very glad they decided to resurrect this one and give it another release under the Unplugged banner. Seek it out if you get the chance.","Osseo, Minnesota, USA","bookman10"

Aroma is of bright, delicious apples, sweet malt, a touch of nuts and hints of vanilla and spice, really smells a lot like apple pie. Flavor starts off with sweet, fresh apples, the apple note takes on a little more of dried and cooked apple notes along with some pie spice, faint hints of caramel, toast and a light nutty note, again, a lot like apple pie, pretty faint on the notes that make it""pie-ish,"" but its a delicious blend. Palate is light bodied with a creamy, slightly syrupy entry, neutral, mouth watering finish and a light, spritzy carbonation. Another masterful, delicious fruit beer from New Glarus. Despite the comparisons to apple pie I wouldnt really say this is ""apple pie in a bottle,"" or anything, (not nearly sweet or spicy enough for one) but the spicy and malt notes lend a great balance to the sweet and slightly tart apple. 07.15.2013 Update: After nearly 3 years the freshness and any acidity of the apple taste has faded, leaving behind sweet, ripe apples and letting through a much more floral and nutty nose, and lots more caramel and nutty flavors.

Appearance : Clear shiny amber with almost no head.

Aroma : Lots of apple with some acidic syrupy notes. Some cough syrup maybe. Interesting fruity notes but Im not sure about the rest.

Taste : Lots of apple, some wheat. A bit acidic and syrupy. Palate is thin. I dont think Ive ever had a beer that thin. Finish is nice apples. No bitterness. Some wheat on the finish also.

Overall : Interesting stuff. Very drinkable. Carbonation is a little bit aggressive (fizzy) but I guess it was needed to balance the thin palate. Enjoyable apple profile thats for sure but I dont think its a beer I would seek out again. Carbonation gets softer with time. Finish is a bit weak.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

4233,"2010-08-31",4.2,"355mL courtesy of CaptainCougar. Well now we have discovered my girlfriends favorite beer taking the top spot from Old Viscosity. It poured a clear, deep gold with a small to medium, dense, creamy, buttermilk head that leaves swathy lacing if you let it. But youll probably drink the entire bottle before the lacing is even allowed to take hold. Aroma is straight chunky apple sauce, apple pie filling, rich artisan apple juice not from concentrate with beautiful caramel in the background that becomes very prominent as it warms. The finale of the nose is hot apple pie drizzled with caramel alongside mulled apple cider. Mulled spices really show through if you give it the time. Taste is not cider, not apple juice, but full creamy apple sauce, slightly apple butter, and a nice spritzy tartness gives the beer such a quenching character like Raspberry Tart and Belgian Red. It is almost impossible to keep the beer in the glass. It seems to evaporate in thin air from everyone wanting to try a sip. If there is a heaven, it would have a happy hour with $5 pitchers of New Glarus fruit beer.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

4233,"2010-06-10",3.6,"12oz bottle, courtesy of MrPickles I think. Most recent Unplugged version, about a year and a half old? Dan said it should still be in great shape, so... Pours a lightly hazy, honey-bronze color; effervescent, almost fizzy profile in the glass; thin off-white head with light retention and lacing; attractive color. This still shows a very fresh, bright apple character in the nose, almost cider-like: sweet apples (tempered sweetness), no spicing, and a light honeyed and caramelly note, some of which Im sure comes from the age, but little suggestions of oxidation overall; great display of apple character, which is meant to be the sole focus here. Medium-light body; modest carbonation; very smooth and velvety character overall; a very, very light metallic tinge at the edges that quickly fades; lacking a bit of carbonation overall for what Id prefer, but just a great display, again, of fresh apples: modestly crisp, honeyed, cider-like without much residual sweetness at all; not bone dry, but well-balanced and dry enough without much/any balancing bitterness; perfectly presented apple character in a quite drinkable beer overall; fresh, with a touch less honey and probably a bit more carbonation, this would be awesome; definitely looking ahead to when this gets released again.

Medium-bodied softly effervescent with a pleasant sweet/tart finish. The flavor is much more apple-forward than the nose, with a soft cider-like front transitioning to a blend of light malt and apple that add a bit of complexity to the sparkling cider quality that this beer undoubtedly possesses.This is a tasty beer.

This tastes like fresh red apples; Ive had the fresh cider from Gays Mills where the apples for this beer come from and it is not surprisingly very much like that cider in flavor. There is also a nice tartness that is seemingly coming off the base beer much more than it is coming from the apples. This has very little green apple sourness or tartness, which is cool. I expected a little more jolly rancher than I got and Im happy that that isnt so much the case.

Has far more complexity than first greets the nose, too. Beneath the candy is some burnt caramel, a nice brown sugar/butter blended fresh in a hot pan, or apple butter. Also tartness and from the fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is prickly and champagne-like. This is a dessert-like beer with an addictive vanilla fudge-like finish that adds complexity.

4233,"2009-02-02",3.7,"Very good, but not entirely what i had in mind. Fun. Could call it a soda. Fruit beers are hard to gage. Some are just hints of the fruit flavor and others...(this) are overwhelming in flavor....and overwhelming in sweet. Though, if a beer is called apple ale it should have apple flavor. Perhaps just too sweet for me. I believe that alcohol should be a little more difficult to consume than this beer. Good in the winter. grown up apple juice.",", Wisconsin, USA","kenter2000"

4233,"2009-01-27",3.9,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.

Pours a clear and very bubbly golden with a small white head that stays on as a ring as the bubbles continue to stream up from the bottom.

The aroma is, not surprisingly, dominated by apples and it smells like a really strong apple cider or fresh apple juice.  Hints of caramel malts are dominated by the sweetness.

The first sip is a blast of tart apple sweetness that zings the tongue before the caramel malts show up briefly.  The finish is very sweet with the apples but also has a slight bitterness that lingers into the aftertaste.

The mouthfeel is well carbonated with lots of sugary sweet apples coating the palate and slightly dry.

This is another great fruit beer from New Glarus who certainly know their way around these styles.  The drinkability may be slightly limited due to the massive sweetness, but its still a great fruit beer.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
4233,"2009-01-26",3.3,"12oz bottle courtesy of ughsmash, light orange color, looks like apple juice. First whiff is apples and apple juice, surprise! Smells really sweet, not sure if I like it. Very strange taste, like the malts are wrestling the apples for control of the beer. Not a bad beer at all just very, very weird.

The look: Clear golden body with almost no head
In long: Nose of apple pie with cinnamon.  Taste is really apple pie with cinnamon, crisp crust and all.  An overall sensation of crumble.  Medium carbonation, very light body.  This is a very very clean beer, a bit too sparkling clean for my liking.  This beer has very little body and the mouthfeel is rather boring.  I understand its a 3.8% beer but New Glarus have proven they can make nourishing full body fruit beer with a similar gravity.  Also while this original taste is kind of fun the first few sips it quickly gets tiresome.  On one hand I admire the originality of this offering but on the other hand this is not something I could drink regularly or in large quantities.

Freshly pressed red apple juice dominates, with subtle hints of soft oak an vanilla falling in line.  Sweet Macintosh apple flavors pair well with mild caramel and just a dash of spicy cinnamon, while a hint of green apple tartness comes through on the finish.

Obviously not the same beer it was, but poured an apple juice color with no head.  Smell is apple juice with some syrupy sweetness.  Taste is dull and likely oxidized, but very apple like.  A lot like the belgian red, but with apples instead.  Some tartness and almost no carbonation.

4233,"2008-07-05",4.5,"Poured a dark golden amber color with a nice white head that retained quite well. Smell is like smelling a crisp apple. Nice and tart, perhaps like smelling apple juice with slightly overripe apples; almost like stepping into an apple orchard. Taste is like biting into a mixture of different apples and moves into the taste of the apple skins, without the astringent tastes of actually biting apple skins. Light-medium carbonation, lighter side of medium bodied with a crisp, dry finish. Excellent drinkability, I’d be drinking plenty of this if it were still produced. This bottle was three years old and still held up remarkabley well, I can only imagine it was more powerful when it was fresh.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"

Minimal lacing. Nice candied apple aroma, sweet and spicy. As it warms, the aroma has more apple and less spice, smelling somehting like a fresh, unpasteurized cider.

The taste is like apple pie in a glass. Seriously, it tastes like baked apples and pie spice. It is honey sweet up front with a bit of tart apple in the finish. Is it more like an ale or a cider?

The nose is dominated by apple, and the spiciness smells like mulled apple cider.  Very strong and obvious sweet apple flavor dominates this beer, and it tastes like real apples, not some fake apple flavoring, and shows a bit of spiciness to it.  It’s intensely sweet, but it’s apple sweet, not sugary sweet.  I’m not getting a whole lot of malt in the flavor, just some modest breadiness I think, but I know it’s there because this doesn’t taste like pure apple cider.  No bitterness whatsoever in this beer, which is quite appropriate.  It’s very tangy, nicely carbonated and refreshing on the palate.  Medium bodied, and nicely carbonated, though the sweetness adds a bit of stickiness.  Slightly hazy and amber in color, but no carbonation bubbles rise through the beer.  The fizzy, off-white head settles to a wide ring, leaving no lacing behind.  This has been a real treat, and except for a slight hint of ""beer"", it’s like drinking spiced apple cider.

Im not familiar with them.  The flavor is apples, light cinnamon, weird spicy cider.  (I have fresh cider in the fridge that doesnt taste like this.  Its much better).  Light pie crust.  Perhaps Im desiring too much of this beer?  I guess growing up on a farm with fresh everything kind of taints you to desire cider more than something pretending to be it.  3.8%?

Rerate of a bottle acquired from John.  The beer pours to a deep rusty orange colored body with a frothy cider-like off-white head.

Can hardly tell this is beer.  Only a hint of malt is detected well after the finish.  The palate is sugary sweet and makes the mouth water.  Medium-full bodied and really creamy.

The aroma I recall sprang to mind walking into an apple barn in the fall.  Musty fruit, wood, etc.  The flavor was 100% apple.  Sure there were some other flavors in there, but all focused on enhancing the apple (like cinnamon spice).  Generally crisp and refreshing but with out a doubt, apple.  Really, the fact that this was a brown ale base was surprising, as I never would have even guessed this was beer.  Some strange hybrid between cider, apple juice and ??

Pours a thick looking orange-marmalade and light amber tinted color, with a rapidly dissipating, bubbly yellow head.  Plenty of bubbles line the sides of the glass (in the liquid).  Leaves a thick film as I drink (half way between lacing and cider legs).  I cant decide if I liked the aroma  or the flavor better, but man were they incredible.  Fresh cinnamon, wonderful, fresh ripe, juicy sweet red apple skins and pulp.  Light tart notes.  Fresh apple crisp baking in the oven, all the way!  Flavor keeps up the cinnamon/nutmeg and huge apple flavor, though it dosent kill you with sweetness.  Wheat notes help add dry balance, lightly sour and tart, moderate to low acidity and a very low carbonation for all of the bubbles in this.  More mushy apples, nice and sugary but it just never gets cloying or syrupy, probably thanks to the spicy/cinnamon flavor.  It almost tastes like smoke or roast for a fleeting moment.

4233,"2005-04-30",4.2,"04.30.05  Thanks to Facto for this 12oz bottle.  Theres something about adding apples to anything that gives it that characteristic brownish-rust color, and this one is no exception.  Smaller head fades quickly.  Aroma is all apples and maybe some hints of honey or maybe apples caramelized and mascerated with sugar.  Whatever, it smells sweet and tastes even sweeter.  Huge apple goodness with plenty of tart apple cider and even a ciderish oxidation, kind of metallic like the brown spots on a bruised fruit.  Its a bit hard for me to find the beer in this stuff, as its mostly fruit, but its so lip smacking fantastic.  lighter hints of butter and white sugar, as with an apple pastry.  Why is it so hard for other brewers to make a good fruit beer while New Glarus has the midas touch with the stuff?  Thanks a million for this one, Matt!","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

Accentuated carbonation and a sweet tartness - paired with caramel malts - help to balance the beer.  Like a sweet, freshly dipped caramel apple.  Finish is crisp and sweet.

Sharp and stinging with prevalent yeast notes casting phenolic and bubblegum esters on the palate. Dab of caramel offsets the quickly vanishing fresh apple tartness. Virtually nonexistent center shows mushy, overripe apples and a putrid yeast character, which prevalently flaws the brew.  Cloying, increasingly sharp finish shows a jumbled mess of overripe apple acidity and leafy dryness.

Poured a clear copper with a small white head.  Aroma is sweet apples.  Taste is sweet with an apple crispness, with hints of brown sugar.  It tastes pretty much like biting into a crisp red delicious apple.  This would be an excellent dessert beer, accompanying apple pie or similar apple dessert.  In this sense, its a complete success.  Its sweetness and lack of tartness really makes it more suited for dessert drinking, and not for refreshment however.

Aroma is musty mushy bruised apples, borderline melon-like with a more musty past-its-prime honeydew thing. Oddly abtrusive yet possibly appetizing and intreguing nose. 

Flavor is mellow and musky with a heavy sweet dark apple skin and mush tone. Pretty darn sweet and thickly so; the apple isnt to bad, its not cidery, its mushy, chewy, tangy, and mellow. The sourness is beyond deep in tone, nearly nonexsisitent until very late where some truer crispy apple tones float across the finish.

Feel is partially thick and chewy with a mellow tang and solid sweet dark apple tone thats melony and candy-like. Sugary through and through; smooth and creamy mediumness in body. 
A strange brew tis true. One thats either a love it or hate it thing. Im right in the middle, I dont particularly like it all that much, but it doesnt bother me or uninterest me either.

The flavor was a sweet but not cloying apple cider taste.  This was very refreshing and delicious.  Would probably make a nice beer to use in cooking something that lends itself to an apple flavor, like pork chops.  My concern is that this beer might not stand the test of time.  My first tastes of OFallon Cherry Chocolate Ale and Weyerbacher Raspberry Imperial Stout left quite an impression but the more I drank of them the less they impressed.  It was likely the initial novelty of the flavors that impressed.  This might be like that.

4233,"2004-12-10",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2004 Poured a copper color with a small off white head. Fresh aweet apple aroma and the taste is mildly sweet as well.  It was not as overbearing as the Raspberry Tart or Belgian Red.  Also definitely sweeter than cider.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
4233,"2004-12-10",4.1,"Thanks to BBB63 for this.  Pours deep copper with a big old white head.  Aroma of malt, apple, brown sugar, caramel.  Tastes malty, with big complex apples and brown sugar and a finishing carbonation with more apples and toffee.  Nice density on the palate.  Like a hard cider on steroids.  Definite malt and hop presence all the way down, which differentiates this from 90% of all hard ciders.  As with all NG beers, great balance and complexity.  Well done.  If Jeff Dahmer and John Wayne Gacy werent alumni of the state, Id seriously consider moving to Wisconsin.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
4233,"2004-12-10",4.4,"Pours light, cloudy brown with small head.  Aroma of fresh apples but of sournbess as well.  Taste is beautiful.  Apples come through clear and crisp, but not overwhelmingly.  Not as sour as a lambic, but more sour than a standard fruit beer.  Leaves nothing to be desired.  Smooth, drinks exceptionally well.  A shame to do anything but sip this, as it is best to make it last long into the evening.  For its style, not much better.","Galesburg, Illinois, USA","civforprez"
4233,"2004-12-09",4.0,"Just as the label says, this does indeed pour a beautiful copper color with a slowly dissipating off white head.  This beer has lively carbonation.  The aroma is definetely very fresh apples with a verry modest sour aroma and a hint of wood and allspice.  Flavor is just outright delicious.  It is as if the freshest, juiciest, most delicous apple you have ever tasted has been distilled into your glass.  Wonderful spiciness also.  Another home run fruit beer from New Glarus.","Bedford, Texas, USA","TChrome"
4233,"2004-12-08",3.2,"Dark amber colored body with a thin off white head. Lots of carbonation in the glass. Aroma is tart Jonathon and Granny Smith apples. Much more intense aroma than most ciders. Also notes of fresh pie crust. The taste is less over the top, but still smacks you in the face. Fresh apples abound in this. However, they are not tart. Apple core and some bread  and spicing come through. I cant pull put any hop bittering. I am sad to say that while I am big fan of apples, NG fruit beers and ciders, this does not come together well. The tartness of their other fruit beers keeps them from being overwhelmingly fruity and sweet. This is too much apples and sweetness. Gets cloying very quickly.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
4233,"2004-12-03",3.8,"Pours a lite copper (similar to apple juice) with a bubbly somewhat fizzy head. Total green apple aromas with some cinnamon and brown sugar. Fairly heavy body with a great amount of residual sweetness. This tastes like the best apple cider Ive ever had. Dont know where the hops are and dont really care. Oh wait, theres some? A slightly bitter finish. The yeast strain has left some complexity to the apple fruitiness leaving behind some figiness as well.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","erway"
4233,"2004-11-29",3.2,"When I opened the bottle I got a huge whiff of apple cider.  Honey and apple cider.  There was very little carbonation in this and the head never really gave it much of a try.  Cidery look to it.  This is definitely an apple flavored beer, with hints of cinnimon and honey.  Too sweet.  I was expecting more from this beer, but it is an interesting use of apple in beer.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"

Light, slightly hazy copper or orange/brown.  Taste is stewed apples throughout.  Slight cinnamon late, even a bit of heat.  Palate is sharp up front then smooths out, but leaves a bitter aftertaste, like apple cores (hope they removed the seeds!).  Extra credit for adventure.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","jewedekind"

Apple skin aroma with a slightly metallic undertones.  Flowery, almost perfumed, notes surround a caramel malt sweetness.  Pulpy, fresh cider flavour, initially a fruity sweetness (much better for me than a sugary sweetness)cinnamon wisps and green apples dance in a very balanced harmony and give way in the end to a lush malt backbone.  Nice carbonation reminds me that this isnt just apple juice and overall I was impressed by my first apple beer

4233,"2004-11-21",4.2,"Great! Facto provision number 2 - thanks!! Cinnamon and many different types of apple flavors abound - tart and sweet, quite leafy and twiggy, incredibly natural and authentic tasting. Looked absolutely beautiful, kept carbonation so perfectly, but what I really loved is the sheer number of separable apple types that must be in here. They all seem to swim throughout the flavor profile. Very good.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
4233,"2004-11-20",3.8,"Deep orange robe, almost clear. Diminishing beige head. Direct apple compote nose overwhelms the senses. Shredded apple flesh thrown up the nostrils in a sweet fashion. Riped delicious (the brand) apple crustade, pie crust. Nice warming medium body, very comfortable, low carbonation. This is definitely interesting, but not in the leagues of the raspberry tart for instance. Maybe Im just more of a raspberry guy, but this seems sweet and simple, which Im aware the other one is also, but it fails to take on me and surpass futile concepts like caring about the complexity rather than overall enjoyment. Here, rather than smelling like a fresh harvest, it appears a bit oldish (which it sure isnt). I fear this wont age well at all, but Im very glad to have sampled it.

4233,"2004-11-20",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 10, 2009 Heart-warming and tongue-moistening sweet and tart apple pie perfume and flavors...Less decadent than its Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart counterparts though, the apples fade into a smooth aftertaste, avoiding a cloying stickiness...Soft prickling helps the dessert functions but also makes it easier for us to see that this is not up to their 2 other fruit beers standards...Nutmeg adds to the pie character, yet this is as juicy and drinkable as apple cider...Its not saying much, but this is probably the best apple beer Ive ever had...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

Much in line with their other fruit beers, this has a champagney quality that enhances the sweet, full apple flavors and brown sugar.  Quite vinous in the aftertaste.  One part cider, one part champagne, one part beer.  Misses the sharp acidic bite of their Raspberry Tart and Belgian Red (due to the nature of the fruit being used) which places this slightly below those beers on the ratings list.

Taste is also overtaken by the apple juice taste, which is great since the apples that were incorporated in here are fresh, sweet (but not too sweet) and with just enough sourness in them. Malt and hops are very hard to taste. Body is just above average with some light carbonation.

Re-rating, 12/3/10, 2010 Vintage:  Copper color with a small, fast falling head.  Aroma of mulling spices, red apples and very sweet malt.  Sweet vanilla and malt taste, almost strikes me as barrel aged notes.  Cinnamon and apples.  Same rating and delicious!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"

4233,"2004-10-28",4.0,"Pours a dirty amber color. Fizzy average sized white head. Smells a bit like cheap or NA champagne. Not that thats bad. Its basically a tart yeasty apple aroma. Quite nice, but is pretty basic. After my nose just convinced me it was NA champagne, the taste is pleasanty subtle. I know a lot of people have brought it up already... but its taste is predominently apple. Spicy apple pie with slight bitterness and sweetened with brown sugar. Very good... not overly sweet at all, and of course it has a great flavor. New Glarus better keep this up, at least as a seasonal.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
4233,"2004-10-27",3.8,"Bottle via MrFacto: Clear coppery amber hue with small but lasting head and good lace. The aroma has notes of spiced ripened apples (cider like), caramel, floral hops, and zesty yeast esters. The taste starts like Im eating my grandmother french apple pie, so yummy. Just when you think it will become too sweet and coy, a nice sour twang and just a touch of bitters clean up the palate. The feel is just average, but so what! I had this those many years ago when it was first released, no much has changed. Yet another excellent fruit beer from the American masters.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Here we go again... a fruit beer ascending my ratings...New Glarus - you make me feel like so much less of a man!  This is the rare beer that I highly anticipated and yet it exceeded my expectation.
The pour is copper, with a smallish soapy head.  The aroma is of tart green apples with a caramel twist.  It was a perfect choice to mix the variety of apples chosen with a brown ale..they just blend perfectly.  The combination of tart and sweet leads right into a finish that is round, malty and sweet - with just the right touch of burn.  There is nothing like a watery spiced cider here, just beautiful malted apples.  This is truly an autumn treat, brewed by the master of the craft of fruit beer.

4233,"2004-10-16",4.3,"Clear red-tinted amber body.  Smells like macintosh apple (both sweet flesh and tart skin) along with malt.  Very enjoyable flavor - its about the same as the aroma but instead of just sniffing it you get to drink it.  Im  hungry right now, and its difficult to resist gulping the rest of my glass down in two swallows.

It has that signature NG fruit beer component that i just love.  Flavors are not as vineous as the aroma would suggest, but has nice flavors of red apples and slightly woody.  Not quite as complex as the other 2 fruit beers, but definately a unique and wonderful experience in itself.  Love it!

4233,"2004-10-12",3.5,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2004 Bottle Pours a rather dark amber with very little off-white head that dissipated quickly to a thin white ring.  Spotty lacing.   Aroma is a nice woody cider note.  Flavor is much sweeter than I expected or even hoped.  At first, seemed more like apple juice than beer.  Like a Jolly Rancher but not as sour or tart which I would have appreciated.  As far a s fruit ber, it dow\es not hold a candle to the Red or Tart that NG offers.  Tasty and sweet.  My wife loves it.  I guess that says it.  ABV is maybe .5% ?  As I continue to sip this, it starts to take on a cough drop mediciny hint.

Unbelievable apple taste. Of the ciders I have had this one has the strongest apple character by far. There is a hint of pear in the taste as well. The sweetness and apple really characterize this beer. No hops noticable at all with a wet finish. This is definately a must try. I paid $3 for a 12oz. I just wish you could get decent priced 6 packs of this stuff.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","eboats"
4233,"2004-10-09",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 26, 2006 GABF 2004: Clear pale golden with a frothy white head.  Sweet and sour candy apple aroma sprinkled with cinnamon.  Reminds me of Thanksgiving dinner for some reason.  Had a candy-like sweetness and sticky finish, but for some reason, this was not quite what I was looking for, but not all that bad.  It just doesnt compare to the flavor and complexity of their two other fruit beers.  I will probably come back to this again some time and see if my opinions change.

Re-rate 12/25/06: after sitting in my fridge for over a year, I finally got to re-sampling this beer.

I am a big fan of fruit beers done right -- and this is wonderful stuff.  Very sparkly but without much of a head.  The color is clear apple cider with a hint of red.  The aroma is like an apple champagne might be and is subtle but good.  Sweet and tart at the same time, with big apple flavors -- but more like eating an apple than drinking a cider.  You can tell that this is a beer, not cider, as there are some malt and hop flavors.  Although very sweet it is somehow also dry, begging the drinker to take another sip.  I cant taste the different apple varieties but there is no doubt that more than one variety is used because the flavor and mouthfeel span such a wide spectrum.  Excellent.  In my book, better than the Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart.  My only complaint is that if it were my beer, I would use more tart than sweet juice and make the beer slightly drier, more along the lines of a good dry cider.","California, USA","tomxcs"

They used Cortland, McIntosh and Jonathan apples and I do believe I can taste all three varieties. Tart crisp Cortland, and te sweetness of the Macs and Jons. Light malt linger.

This is the first time Ive seen this on tap, and I had to give it a shot; glad I did, its much more sour and complex than I remembered, with the same amazing sweet-tart balance that the flagship cherry and raspberry beers display, oakier and with more farmy notes than the last bottles I had (a couple of years ago).  Hmm, why dont they put these in 750s? (2001, from old notes): One of my favorite fruit beers, and another fine product from this great Wisconsin brewery.  Now I ask you, in the forum thread on great beer states why wasnt Packerland mentioned?  Lakefront is actually my favorite domestic brewery and New Glarus is up there.  Maybe its cuz they dont get wide enough distribution... or maybe Old Style and Schlitz just drop the state down too much. 
omhper in Montreal #2 (with MartinT,tiggmtl,Rastacouere,DYCSoccer).  Sometimes the memory holds up, and this is a prime case...12 oz bottle (bring back the big ones guys!)...cloudy cider-cognac color, sharp baked apple-spice aroma, a bit buttery and pastry-like late...juicy fresh cider and a touch of spice, vanilla and bourbon in the flavor....very low carbonation (the only real problem), white-wine mouthfeel.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
4233,"2001-06-13",2.6,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2009 Light amber with some rather large bubbles for a craft beer.  It smells overwhelmingly appley, in a candyish way, and without nuance.  Sweet, appley, candyish, again without nuance.  The malt lends body, and a sweetness in the finish that keeps it from being too much like a cider.  But this is far too simple a beer for my tastes.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
