3625,"2016-08-10",3.7,"On tap @ Cellarmaker. Clear copper beer with a white head. A bitter with a bunch of newfangled American hops, eh? Alright. Despite the hops that are offered here, I get a fairly floral and grassy hop aroma to start before the citrus, melon, and stone fruits start to come through. Get some lemon, orange, grapefruit, and cantaloupe. Pretty interesting combination. Maybe some dried pineapple, too. Pretty substantial malt flavor (or is that flavour?) here of toasted grain and bread. Havent loved some of their British-inspired offerings, but this was a nice enough beer.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

3625,"2014-06-20",3.5,"Pours a medium orangey amber color. Its rather cloudy. Smallish off-white head, which fades to not much after a minute. Little lacing. Aroma is hoppy with some rye spice thrown into the mix. The hops are bright citrus and tropical fruits but fairly subdued. I was kinda expecting it to be all hopped up and juicy, but its more of a delicate beer, which I guess shouldnt be surprising as a 3.8% abv bitter. The rye plays nicely with the hops and mostly sits in the background. Some gentle caramel and biscuity malt. The taste is similar. Its hop forward and tastes quite fresh but still rather subdued. Nice but mild malt flavor. Some more spice, some gentle sweetness, though its a fairly dry beer, really. Very easy to drink. Moderate hop bitterness, which doesnt get in the way of the flavor in the least. Relatively low carbonation. Gentle feel, a bit washed out. Its hard for me to judge bitters, even Americanized ones. I do like the beer. Its just a bit simple, and the complexity of the listed hops doesnt really come out for me.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
