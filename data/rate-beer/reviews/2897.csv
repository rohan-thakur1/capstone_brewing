2897,"2014-12-27",3.6,"750ml bottle acquired via trade on BA. Thanks bro. Pours a gently hazed golden hue, a nice gentle orange glow with frothy whitish head atop with a decent ringer, mellow lacing. A nice late summer glow with some cascading bubbles through the body. Aromas are a bit grainy, bready and cereal with mellow jabs of fruit, touches of oak, faint white wine. Grapeskin, gentle fruit and spice. Mellow funk, subtle white pepper and touches of pineapple. Mellow vanillin, kiss of straw and earthiness. A bit grainy, wet and funky on the nose, but more mellow. Initial is lighter end of the fold, some decent white grape and wine meet touches of crab apple, pear and pineapple. A bit of fuzziness, carbonation and tartness hit the palate with some pineapple, white grape and lemon. Some touches of yogurt, funk and cobwebs meet some straw, dry grainy and dusty feel. Some cheesecloth, gentle lactic jabs and some juicy tart pineapple. Gentle citrus, green apple and funk. Gentle, enjoyable. The nose seems off but the beer comes together pretty well I think.

2897,"2014-11-14",4.3,"Draft and Bottle (16e label)  reviewed from notes (May, June, October 2014). According to Johnny, Nonnas #6 is 1/4 Barrel-Aged Little Quibble, 1/4 Barrel-Aged Anais and 1/2 barrel-aged saison with Bug Country yeast. Aroma is blasting with ripe fruit (similar to #5): peaches, pear, melon. There is a mix of citrus as well like lemon peel and sour grapefruit. The yeasty funk is the classic Sante eggy, fruity twang and there is definitely acid present. Rustic grain quality is light, but ties it all in. The beer pours hazy orange/deep golden with fluffy white head that sticks around for most of the glass. Taste is all the ripe fruits mentioned, but more noticeable is the citrus, light peach, straw, light funky cheesiness, a little sulfur, but not distracting. Body is medium-full, creamy, lovely yogurt-lactic tartness, and medium carbonation. The beer finishes a little full - definitely not as dry as #5. Overall, its deliciously sour and fruity with nice oak presence. Its similar to Nonnas #5 but more funky. Keep the blends coming.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"

2897,"2014-07-05",4.3,"Gonna rerate this for rating #2100! On tap at the brewery. Pours orange gold with a white head. Deep kombucha/yogurt aroma, bacteria all over the place. Notes of clementine and Meyer lemon, slightly Bretty end with phenolic accents. Flavor has a bunch of strange fruit, kumquat, lime and apple, plus acidic citrus. Chardonnay and pink lemonade, like a weird Mimosa. Funky Bretty finish. Great tartness and spritzy body. 

Old rating: On tap at the Sante 2-year Anniversary party. Pours hazy gold with a white head. Funky eggy aroma with lemons and citrus rind. Flavor is heavy on pink lemonade, sweet grapes, sour grapefruit. Really pleasant beer.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
2897,"2014-06-15",4.2,"On tap at Sante's 2 year party. This was quite similar to nona 5. A - the pour was a very light glowing yellow with small white head. S - the nose is a nice combo of funky citrusy sour. Lemon juice, light acetic notes and a strong pink lemonade lead the way. Hay and egg funk, with that nice Sante yeast profile. Quiet hints of spice and bell pepper. M - light and bright with a nice dry end. Nice balance of dry, sweet, tart and funky. T - the taste follows the nose well. Citrusy up front with a distinct pink lemonade. Lemon and orange juice. Sara yeast, hay, egg funk. O - clean and crisp. Just a nice light sour with subtle complexity. 4.2","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
