1195,"2017-06-17",4.4,"Here we are in Vermont and the Alchemist is around the corner. The aroma is hoppy to the nth degree filtering out of the can like a testicle popping out of a too tight zipped pair of pants. The appearance is a hazy dank VT style resin bomb. The taste is a glorious blizzard of hop fury, complete with a smooth finish for a 9%er, resiny, dank, citrus, all the goodness. This is a glorious testament to the power of the hop. Good for chilling wit yo homies in VT before Jacking in the box (talking about the Jackbox Party Pack, not the fast food chain, or a dirty reference).

1195,"2017-05-29",4.0,"1 pint can. Pours very hazy, golden yellow with a thick off white frothy head. Thick full look with some residue at the bottom of the glass. Smells citrusy hoppy with some pine and resin. Some pineapple and mango with a bit of malts as well. Smooth earthiness as well. Very hoppy and bitter taste. Nice resin and pineyness throughout. Some citrus and bright fruits but mostly bitter. Thick full mouthfeel, great frothy carbonation and a long lingering bitter aftertaste. Overall not as fruity and citrusy as I usually like them but a very good strong hop flavor. Lovely.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Sudz4Dayz"

Was lucky enough to get 10 pretty sweet beers sent to me by a college buddy. Was really looking forward to this one, having head Heady Topper a few times and Focal Banger the other night. Expecting to be in the 4.40-to-4.55 range. 

Poured a light-to-medium yellow hazy color with 2-to-3 fingers of rocky white head. Lots of bubble streams coming up along the sides of the glass. Excellent foamy lacing. Almost perfect foamy retention. (Sight - 4.50)

Smelled Citra, Cascade, juicy grapefruit, mango, pineapple, peach, tangerine, floral, herbal mints, hints of menthol and sugary candy. (Smell - 4.25)

Tasted a little better version of the smell. Very sugary like I expected. Got Citra, Cascade, juicy grapefruit, mango, pineapple, tangerine, herbal grass, leafy hops, floral, unknown spices, mint, booze, passion fruit, sharp pine, lemon zest and lime. (Taste - 4.25)

Medium body. Sticky texture. Lively carbonation. Sugary, bitter finish. (Feel - 4.25)

This was very good, just two sweet for me overall. Reminded me slightly of a Todd the Axe Man, but not nearly as good. (Overall - 4.25)

Potent c- and tropical fruit-hops aroma: pineapple, resin, strawberry, along with some base malt in the background.

Un nez, un concentré de jus de houblons verts et de fruits habituellement associés au style. Il y a une certaine démesure là-dedans. En fait, rien nest vraiment délicat mais tout est intéressant. En bouche, la fraîcheur des cultivars donne un grand coup. La résine, la terre, les fruits et les feuilles de la plante nagressent pas mes papilles puisque le sucre est monté en conséquence. Agréable, dans une certaine mesure. Au palais, le corps est impérial. En finale, parfums fermes dun brasseur qui en fait trop avec ses houblons.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

1195,"2016-09-03",4.3,"This was poured into a snifter. 
The appearance was a burnt hazy orange color with a slim fingers worth of white foamy head, barely any lacing and kinda messy for what is there.
The aroma starts off with sweet papaya with some mango warming up with some sweet to bitter danky onion.
The flavor starts danky bittersweet. Onion, papaya and mango flow together to combine that danky to tropical fruit bittersweetness. Aftertaste is the same with a quick wet bittersweet finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a nice sipping to sessionable quality about it. Carbonation runs light, feels good. Light throaty hop burn without alcohol burn.

1195,"2016-07-19",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 10, 2016 Draught at the new brewery, 7/8/16.Pale, golden-lemon rind colored body shows a good deal of haze, but not soupiness. White head atop is rocky and mostly well-retained.Big citrus and tropical fruit notes are juxtaposed in the nose. Not sure if the more austere citrus or the juicy notes win out, but it doesnt really matter. Stronger malt bill seems pretty predictable, to support the bigger hop character. Gains a strong fruitiness, with a touch of caramel and lots of honey though the hop acids keep it from coming off as juicy-sweet as Focal. Alcohol well-concealed, which is impressive, with no flaw and the hops very, very fresh.White grapefruit, strong tangerine and big pineapple notes mix with a juicier mango character while a highly dextrinous body easily balances the big bitterness. Keeps its head and finishes pretty brightly and with a good levity despite its massive nature. I liked the juicier, softer, lighter Focal but this was nothing to scoff at, for sure.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Refreshing and a touch sweet, with gentle sugars on the palate towards the finish. Another great hoppy offering from John.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
1195,"2016-07-16",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 13, 2016 Update: sampled on tap at the brewery. Not too sure if because it wasnt in can or my mood was different but didnt feel the same about it. Thought it was really good but not exceptional like before. Taking away 2 points. Maybe next time I have it in can, Ill update it again. Old rating: 473ml can drank from the can and poured a small glass to analyze the look. Aroma: herbacy, citrusy. Loads of fresh pineapples. App: murky orange, small white head, lacing like orange pulps on my glass. Taste and palate: medium body, crushed fruits in mouth, moderate crisp bitter finish. Overall: wow! This is really good. For having tested both from the can and poured in a glass, from the can wins hands down. Feels more fresh in can, more well blended. This beer deserves this name. It?s really like drinking a mix of crushed tropical fruits with citrus. The mouthfeel is just perfect (from the can). I guess I?ll need to go back to The Alchemist before my vacation to stock up some and use my hide-a-beer fake Monster can to drink it on the beach. A really big coup de foudre for me.

This soul-lifting Double IPAs fluffy mouthfeel is the perfect propeller for green hop resins and their angelic citrusy fruitiness, a perfume and flavor profile supported by biscuity pale malts and tickled by alcohol.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam decorates the hazy straw yellow, lacing admirably.
-This 2009 batch obviously did not yield the same results as what my Montreal friends had last year. Too sweet and not aromatic enough? This was pretty much the opposite.
-The aroma on this one is pure hop heaven. Citrusy, sandy, resinous, grassy, alleluia! 
-The resinous bitterness is strong, but levelled with the aroma and flavor profile.

On tap at the brewpub.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
1195,"2009-03-19",3.6,"Pours a cloudy dark gold color with a medium offwhite  head.  Strong aroma of piney hops and caramel malt. Solid flavor of almost aggressive piney hops, theres a decent malt back-bone in there along some sweetness and alcohol, theres moderate bitterness in the end. The body is light to medium with a liquorous texture and gentle carbonation. I liked this quite a lot.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
1195,"2008-09-04",3.2,"Sampled at brewpub. Pours a light golden/copper color with a white head. Aroma of citrus, pine and some notes of grapefruit. Flavor is light malts, pine, grapefruit and a hint of caramel with a strong bitter finish.","Croydon, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerdedone"
1195,"2008-08-10",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2009 In short: A intense but highly drinkable IIPA with a bit of everything.
How: Tap at brewpub.  Summer 2009 batch (HUGE improvement over the first batch of summer 2008) 
The look: Clear light orange body topped by a small white head
In long: Highly aromatic hoppy nose with a bit of everything from citrus fruits, grapefruits, pine-tree cones and all.  Body has plenty of pale malts with dry bread and social-tea cookies.  Far from rich and round caramel yet I found this mostly neutral malt backbone totally appropriate to let the hops avalanche express itself.  Hopping is bold and aggressive.  Same elements as in the aroma (citrus fruits, grapefruits, pine-tree cones and all).  A nice dryness sensation.  Strong bitterness.  A huge improvement over the sugary brew with unexpressive hopping that was the first batch.  This is a beer for those who like bold in-your-face hoppy brews, this is The Crusher, not The Polisher.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1195,"2008-08-02",3.9,"Draft at the brewpub - Poured a orangish amber in color with a medium foamy head that faded to a small rim around the top of the beer.  Aroma is strong of grapefruit/citrus hops and little else.  Flavor is dominant with grapefruit and piney resinous hops.  This is, perhaps, the hoppiest beer that John has produced... a true hop explosion.  Really good, but the lack of a malt understructure detracts from the excellence here.  Could use some additional aging... might mellow the hop ""bite""...  I *really* like this beer!","Seymour, Tennessee, USA","VTHopHead"
1195,"2008-07-28",3.0,"Objectively speaking:
Rather alcoholic, gritty and rough IPA.

I like:
Very hoppy indeed, but not as aromatic as other Alchemist IPAs. 

I dislike:
Strong  bitterness is accompanied by a certain yeastiness that makes it less bright than Id hoped. Soapy edges. Rather timid malt character.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
