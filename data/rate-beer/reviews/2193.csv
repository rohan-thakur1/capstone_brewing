2193,"2016-12-01",3.8,"Good German lager aroma from a beautiful absolutely crystal clear medium yellow body with a medium foamy white head. The German lager aroma and yeastiness follows into the taste nicely. A fairly sharp earthy, black pepper bitter hop bite follows that isnt really in line with a true Oktoberfest, but Im guessing thats SNs signature here. Good medium creamy texture with some floral notes near the end of the sip. Finishes with a good Oktoberfest taste and lasting bitterness. I think I preferred last years version since it was closer to style, but this is an excellent beer on its own regardless. I drank quite a bit of this during the season (and at Oktoberfest at SN in Chico!) and this was the last bottle. Looking forward to next years version!","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"

The ones in the middle or off balanced I dont really care for. This is the latter....not much malt but with a good hop balance.

2193,"2016-11-03",3.5,"This is a late autumn pinot from a reddish green grape, a bit sweet juice, a bit tart skin, with dough in your cheek. It wants to go down quick as a watered down spritzer on a hot day, but the tongue wants to linger on ghosts of spice and malice. It cant pour into a glass too tall. The layered close-knit together mash of influences, well-documented all, muddled start to finish into what may seem a bland mess to some... but for me, it tastes how an average beer should, or perhaps the average of the best bits of many average beers stewed for too long and malted some. In the end, this ambrosia is divine cruelty, too soon lost even as it is found. A special reminder that every now is a great moment to be alive.","Yonkers, Alabama, USA","SNYUM"

Being a collaboration with a German Brewery I would have expected it to be a really good example of an Oktoberfest but it isnt. Gold brew with decent head that fades off fairly fast. All of the others brews have been dark gold to amber in color so this one is a little too light. Aroma is grainy and the taste is typical lager with a slight hop bitterness.

2193,"2016-10-14",3.3,"12oz bottle. 7/6/16 bottle date. Appearance: Deep straw/light golden, clear, with a quickly disappearing white head. 
Aroma: Bready malt with a light floral hop note. 
Taste: Rich, bready, cracker like malt that turns to a sharp herbal bitterness on the swallow. Light caramel arrives after the finish. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a low to moderate carbonation. A touch of alcohol warmth is noticeable. 
Finish: Very dry and sticky on the tongue, with a lingering bitterness. 
Overall: A light take on the style, much more in line with a festbier than a marzen. I really like the bready maltiness of this beer, very nice for the style. Bitterness is perceived to be a bit high due to the light body, which also allows some alcohol heat to come thru. Carbonation could also use a boost.","","TH28"

2193,"2016-10-12",3.5,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2016 My Bottom Line:
This slender Festbier offers plenty of drinkability, with delicate straw-like malts and a white pepper-like hop profile.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the translucent golden.
-Aroma is a bit too subtle, even for this delicate style.
-Water profile is quite mineral.
-Carbonation is initially prickly but softens up quickly enough.
-The usual deep Pils malt profile I normally find in German-made examples is shy in this one.
-You really need to let this warm up to perceive its subtleties.

Looks: Clear light golden colour; less than one quarter finger head and residual soapy white foam which fades in 10 seconds; Fair good sticky lacing with notable slight carbonation.

Aroma: Quite pungent lager malt, with grains, canned apricots, peaches, strong floral, sugar, spices, bread, light lemon and strong grass.

Taste: Close to medium sweet lager malt, with light bockish, light floral, fair molasses, spice, strong biscuits, fair lemon, medium bitter hops and grass.

Body: Mid to light body. Quite Slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Strong lager maltyness in a fairly solid background. Fair Munich bockishness, light flowery, fair sweetness, subtle spiciness, very chewy bready with fair lemon to round. Decent.

Hoppiness: Canned apricots, peaches, strong floral, spices, light lemon and strong grass in nose. Light floral, spice, lemon and grass in taste; Bitterness is fairly strong for a lasting, mid astringent Pils malty finish.

After Taste: Quite dry. Bready and quite bitter to mouth.

Comments: This one seems to be more lager-like than last years amber-ish version. It feels a little lightweight for the style, and the hoppiness is quite nice in fruity aroma but a little short in taste. Taste a lot like Suntorys Premium Malt Master Dream.

Gold as the hair of a member of the German swim team Gutvik good fuck en Deutch. Solid amt of bitterness, akin to someone missing Oktoberfest because it actually took place in September, and they didnt know.

takin another crack, 8/12, old school hops, sedate, gold 6% looks like could be a pils, a bit heavier and into the bitter end, over dry. Made in collab with German brewer Mahrs Brau, really light for a fester, would maybe even put this, in a flight, ahead of the Southern Star, perhaps at end too, to refresh. Could go as a Texan fest, so light and refreshing, kind of thing we need here even in Oct. If this were the only fest beer at a fest, id like it, but would probably want to sneak some bourbon in eventually.

West coast hop element? No, apparently an old German variety called Record. Perhaps the most unique of the festies, starting to love the subtle hard toffee sweetness hidden in her golden locks like a pen knife or a joint of what they been perfecting in those hills for years.

2193,"2016-09-07",3.5,"Packaged on 7/20/16. Clear straw in color. Tight white head hangs around with persistence. Pleasant aroma of flower nectar, apricot, piecrust, honeyed baguette, lemon meringue and minerals. Fairly woody, as well. Soft, dense, plentiful carbonation. Decidedly snappy right out of the gate, yet with a contrasting succulent malt punch which stops shy of melanoidiny. Nectary hops disperse rich, satiating oils across the tongue as minerals invigorate and cleanse the tongue. Stiff crackery malt and toasty graham cracker reinforce the well-structured maltiness and beautifully accentuate the residual sugars. Lager yeast provides a twinge of sharp sulfur that adds personality without tarnishing the cleanness. Body teeters on viscous at times, as honey and apricot puree notes contribute quite a bit of muscle and some tackiness. A growing huskiness suggests scorched wood and approaches astringency, but the thoroughly extracted malt boasts ample softness beneath, along with an array of finespun intricacies including adequate amounts of ""chewy"" haystacks to keep it at bay. Pervasive hop oils are enhanced by the buried zing of lemon meringue (Saphir?) which soothe the tongue and alleviate the huskiness as their sappiness synergies with the lip-smacking malt. Assertively hoppy yet exquisitely balanced finish displays bouncy baguette drizzled with silky nectar-rich hop oils. Pretty nice brew! While the malt character feels a tad overcomplicated and ""forced"" to me, suggesting the use of a multitude of malts instead of decocting a simpler grain bill along the lines of Vienna and pils malt, the brewers have succeeded at attaining a multilayered maltiness thats rather rich and satisfying. Quite a solid version and one that Ill be enjoying copious amounts of in the coming months!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

2193,"2016-09-01",4.6,"Its bold of Sierra Nevada to claim theyve ""created the most authentic take on [Oktoberfest/Marzen] this side of the Atlantic"" but when youre right, youre right. Sierra Nevada has nailed German styles before (Kellerweis comes to mind), and this Oktoberfest is accurate as anything theyve done. Copper pour with off-white foam. Malty, bready, and subtly fruity aroma. Bready sweet flavor with notes of toffee and apricot. The body is smooth - approachable.

Its good too, pleasantly reserved hoppiness w/ legit malt character and only a slight hint of sweetness. This tastes and drinks a bit bigger than, say, a helles or something but it is still nice and quaffable w/ its medium body and zesty carbonation.

Very clean on lager flavors with zero yeast ester notes present. Light dryness from bitterness as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately grainy/bready, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 6%.

2193,"2016-08-14",3.4,"Bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is medium to dark yellow.

Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately bitter, slightly husky. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.
Well, its better than last years at least. Still quite watery and the malt seems a little husky. But it smells more authentically German than the Riegele version. Mahrs is one of the more mediocre/generic brewers in Franconia, so it stands to reason this is also a bit generic and rough, but its definitely slammable and isnt overtly Americanized.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Outstanding clean lager nose. Light herbal hops with a subtle floral note over a bready backbone with a subtle diacetyl buttery note hidden underneath. 

Light medium body that is smooth and slightly slick. World class carbonation / body balance that opens the flavor up. The middle is moderately effervescent and culminates in a finely bubbled prickly finish.

The flavor profile is borderline outstanding. It begins with a herbal note that flows to the middle. Here a mild sweetness arrives that is mostly bready but does have a cracker element.
