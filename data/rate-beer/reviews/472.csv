472,"2017-04-28",3.9,"Another expensive pint bottle that somehow winds up warranting the price tag from Maine Beer Co. The smell is smooth chocolatey velvety with notes of fresh cut tobacco and pancake syrup. The body is classic stout blackish brownish with a thing root beer head. The taste is rather lovely, smooth choco vanilla that almost gives it a dessert beer vibe, but enough smoke on the backend to prevent any cloying effects.

Le nez est très joli : très bourbon, par mail de café et de chocolat au lait, quelques notes de chocolat blanc. On sent un côté fumé un peu porter, on sent un côté un peu vert, artichaut. Bel équilibre.
En bouche, attaque très légère, assez chocolat et un petit café léger. On part sur une amertume très sympathique de torréfaction avec un fond houblonné assez floral et un fond fumé bien équilibré. Les notes vanillées/bourbon sont beaucoup plus discrètes.","Lyon, FRANCE","Bawelt"
472,"2016-03-25",3.9,"Nitro at Dohertys, 3/19/16.Huge, dark beige head tops an ebony body. Strong retention, of course. Indeterminable clarity.Trying to smell through/around the thick nitrogenated head is annoying, but I do get some dough, plaster, dark, bitter chocolate and light vanilla notes. Smells pretty standard stout-like, with a bit of marshmallow or grassy character in there too. Light coffee and cola notes with warming. No alcohol or flaw.Nicely attenuated with real vanilla flavor and deep, burnt, bitter roast providing rich coffee and cacao flavors. Vanilla beans add light bitterness as well (and of course the vanilla flavor), while theres some green, juicy, somewhat citric hop character on the end. I guess the nitro makes it more drinkable on account of it making it more watery/loose in texture, but I certainly prefer it much more not on nitro. Great beer, though. Hoppy, but not overdone there and very dry.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

There is a roasty chocolate and a disappointing roast on the back end. There is a light oatiness that brings a breadiness to the table, but it's disappointing. The flavor is slightly less disappointing. There is a roasty chocolate and a light vanilla. The malts come through and take over and it's just not that great. The mouth feel is light and watery with a decently velvety carbonation. The aftertaste is quick fading and oaty malts. This is another disappointment from MBC.

A little more roast & a little more coffee show up on the palate, which certainly isnt a bad thing. Some notes of dried, dark prunes & the faintest kiss of anise in the finale, too. Warmth brings out the creamy & milky tones a little more, giving the dark chocolate element of the beer a little boost. Lingering notes of roast, chocolate malt, & mild coffee beans.

472,"2014-08-06",3.9,"I poured a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 7/15/14 and cost $6 ($0.36 per ounce).

Appearance: Dark black body, completely opaque, no sediment or carbonation visible. Pours to a large, brown, frothy head which laces and retains extremely well.

Smell: Slightly mild, but with notes of coffee and dark chocolate.

Taste: Maine Beer Company is known for their hoppy beers, so I was quite eager to try a malt-forward beer by them: Mean Old Tom; a stout aged on natural vanilla beans. From the description and recipe I was expecting a big, bold stout, but what I got was a rather nominal brew that happens to have some sweet components to it. Not that theres anything wrong with how this turned out, since the result is still a more-than-solid brew.

This beer is brewed with a fairly standard malt bill with the addition of some flaked oats, though I wouldnt classify it as an oatmeal stout per se. Its lightly sweet up front, with an almost cola-like taste. Through the middle theres some coffee and roasted malt flavor and bitterness with a sweet vanilla taste on the back end. It creates for a milk chocolate flavor, but its entirely too mild. A bit of an oatmeal sweetness can be found lurking in the background, as well as an English-like mineral quality Ive never found in any other beers from this brewery. Id imagine an imperialized version of this brew would be intense and amazing, but whats here is nice and satisfying.

Drinkability: Getting through a glass of Mean Old Tom was no challenge whatsoever. The mouthfeel is thinner than youd expect, though its smooth going down and finishes clean. It probably should be a bit bigger in body than it is at 6.5% ABV, as this drinks like a lighter pub-style stout. Works fine as a liquid dessert or a standalone beverage.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

472,"2014-07-02",4.1,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a black color with a one finger head of a thick creamy head of an off tan colored foam which cascades up through the brew as it is poured. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time to leave a moderate level of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the beer is heaviest of a sweeter roasted malt and vanilla smells with lots of notes of a coffee smell. Along with these smells comes some smells of a more caramel sweet and chocolate smell, which produce a very inviting and dark aroma overall.
 Taste  The taste begins with a nice creamy roasted malt flavor with tons of caramel and some vanilla. As the taste advances the vanilla gets stronger and stronger with a chocolate flavor working its way onto the tongue. The chocolate and vanilla grow stronger to the end with a little bit of a oaky flavor working its way onto the tongue as well. Along with the oak, so too comes some espresso and a bit of a smoke flavor, which with the vanilla and chocolate leave a slightly bitter but still sweet and smooth roasted flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the slightly lower side. Both are nice for the big roasted and vanilla flavors of the brew and allow for a nice soothing mouth coating feel.
 Overall  A quite enjoyable stout with lots of flavor all at a more modest (at least in big flavored stout terms) abv of only 6.5 %. This was a rather nice roastey and sweet treat.","","Darkmagus82"

MF: soft carbon, medium to full body. Taste: little sour, lots of vanilla, coffee, dark burnt caramel, not sweet at all, slightly sour. Aftertaste: coffee, cocoa powder, chocolate, hint of caramel, little sour, mocha and more coffee. Very decent beer, especially for the low alcohol.

A passable stout does not make me want to rush to Maine to check out the source. However it is solid enough that if it were my local Id have few complaints at the right price point. If a few more releases make their way to northern Ohio I would definitely be willing to give Maine Beer another chance.

Aroma / Appearance - The reddish black base is capped by a fizzy brown head. Hints of carbonation escape but given the color it is hard to tell how much. Vanilla ice cream, coffee, dark fruits, and more remind me of a specialty Starbucks espresso slightly diluted.

Flavor / Palate - Vanilla and coffee tickle the tip of the tongue. A wave of maltiness clings to the throat like sticky tar paper. There is not that much depth but the evident flavors play well with each other. Overall this is a generally unremarkable release that is worth checking out if you happen across it.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
472,"2013-12-12",3.5,"Pours a thick impenetrable black with a small brown head and the pour shows some carbonation. Smells of roasted malts, yeast and vanilla but also a discomforting metal drum smell. Thankfully the last does not effect the enjoyment of the actual beer. Roasted coffee gives it a mostly bitter flavor, the vanilla beans more come at the end to balance it out. Thick bodied but too much carbonation. Doesnt have a very strong taste mostly the bitter coffee malt shines through. Is still good but not as special as I hoped.","Rhode Island, USA","RyanK"

Roastiness, dark chocolate and vanilla merge for the tastiest of results as they are joined for the long run in the finish by precise hop resins.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam settles atop the impenetrable darkness.
-Vanilla dosage is wisely done. Just enough to add character while never getting close to being sickening (like it can easily be).
-This gets more and more engaging as you down the pint.
-The mouthfeel is rich yet approachable.

472,"2013-07-10",4.1,"Pour from a bottle into a small plastic water glass, because thats all that was offered at this conference. Served at ~60 degrees because I cant find an ice machine, but eff it. Dark pour with a billowing cola head that collapses to a dense cap and nice lacing. Aroma is slightly subdued with notes of cherry, lightly astringent roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate. I get some almost sour notes initially which really work well here and heighten the perception of fruit. Taste is lots of bitter cocoa and coffee up front, moving to sweeter notes of vanilla, lightly roasted caramel malt, more chocolate. Indistinct fruit notes throughout Finishes slightly bitter with a lasting cocoa and vanilla aftertaste. Silky smooth mouthfeel. I really liked this one, delivers a good deal of complexity at an ABV much lower than I would have thought, making it easy to enjoy a full bottle of.

Pours black with a three finger creamy/foamy brown head that slowly recedes to a small foamy cap and leaves nice rings and webs of lacing behind.

Flavor is rich vanilla, chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, some caramel, moderate sweetness, some bitterness, minimal alcohol.  Tasty.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, pretty smooth and creamy but a bit of a carbonation bite too.

Really tasty vanilla Stout.  The vanilla isnt subtle, its definitely here and a big component of this brew, nice chocolate notes too.  Ive got one more bottle that Ill sit on for a couple of months to let the hops fade out a bit which I think would help.","Ringgold/Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA","elgiacomo"

The best way I can aptly describe the overall experience of this beer is to admit that it evokes some deep-ceded childhood memories. As a kid we all had one friend whos mother always ended up chauffeuring you to soccer games. You spent long drives in the unvacuumed third row seats of a minivan while she chain smoked and drank way too much Dunkin Donuts French Vanilla.

The beer had a full, rich black color with a wet consistency and a large creamy lighter tan head with good retention, and great lacing and cling.  Its aroma featured powerful notes of roasty vanilla with compliments of chocolate and coffee, along with some earthy and cereal hops.  The taste was initially a pleasant sweet vanilla with lighter malty tones of chocolate and caramel, and a modest earthy and cereal bitterness as it settled.  Its body was crisp, creamy, and wet with a semi-watery, but filling mouthfeel with lower carbonation and a slightly dry finish.  Great beer, thanks Siobhan!","Denver, Colorado, USA","Derek881"

A: The body is an excellent pitch black with only a thin dark tan head, the head has poor retention but has a light coating and ring on the top.

S: The aroma is strong of coffee and cocoa with very light vanilla in the background. The aroma is very smooth and balanced.

T: The main flavor is a bitter coffee flavor with light cocoa and light vanilla, the vanilla is most prominent on the finish while the cocoa is in the middle.

M: Medium bodied with medium carbonation, mildly fizzy.

O: Very good stout, especially for the ABV. The vanilla and cocoa are really subdued which is a good and a bad thing, overall this is a solid beer though, just a tad expensive.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"
472,"2012-10-21",4.1,"500ml bottle from City Market Burlington.
Appearance : Pitch black with small foamy brown head. Lots of lacing.

Aroma :  Rich and silky roasted malt with with light coffee and some chocolate. Light vanilla notes. Light woody notes, light resinous notes. 

Taste : Rich roasted malt with coffee and chocolate. Coffee is more present on the arrival while chocolate comes more powerful on the finish. Late finish bring back the coffee with resinous hops. Light coffee acidity all along.

Palate : Soft carbonation. Nice rich silky body. Great carbonation for the style.

Overall : Wow another great beer. Nice big malty presence. Rich but sharp with well defined flavors. Great balance between malt and hops. Awesome texture. Utterly drinkable. Acidity is a tiny bit over the level that I enjoy. Outstanding as always with Maine Beer Company.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

Chocolate, ash, oats, a little bit of vanilla, as well as a touch of oak in the aroma.  Nice.  The flavors are also good, but not quite as impressive as the scent.  Its very smooth going down.  I wouldnt call it thin but its easier going than expected.  Mocha combines with caramel, wood, and vanilla to comprise of the flavors.  The vanilla really doesnt stand out and its fair to wonder whether I would have noticed it if I wasnt looking for it.  The finish is nice and dry with some bitter pine hops.

472,"2012-10-11",3.6,"In short: A velvety semi-roasted stout with vanilla notes.  Decent beer.
How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed relatively fresh, 3 months after bottling date (I LOVE breweries that print exact bottling dates on the label)
The look: Black body topped by a medium dark beige head
In long: Nose is medium roasted, notes of old black coffee and only light notes of vanilla.  Taste is very creamy and velvety, light coffee notes, some vanilla extract, milky sensation, good presence of herbaceous hops in the finish.  This beer actually tastes like a moderately roasted oatmeal stout with some vanilla extract added.  I expected more vanilla (not a complain) because of the label description but the vanilla beans are far from overwhelming.  All in all Im almost disappointed by this beer, every other output from this fine brewery really stood out from the crowd, however this Mean Old Tom stout is very good but nothing special.  Far from their best beer effort, this is still a solid beer by this environmentally conscious brewery, proud member of the 1% For The Planet movement, but never mind the environment, just think about how much the next generation will hate us when they realize weve taken all the good usernames!!!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Pours black with about a finger of light tan head. Smell is a pretty solid amount of roasty espresso. Taste is a lot lighter than some stouts.

Nose is nicely subtle: tiramisu, rum soaked lady fingers, sharp cocoa, lemony twang, acidic coffee. Taste is thinner than expected and a bit dirty to earthy with mild grittiness. Not quite what I was expecting given the ridiculous reputation of this new brewery: MO, Zoe, Lunch, Spring Peeper. Needs a little work.

Starts with typical dry stout flavors: mellow malt, roasted grains, burnt toast, tangy hops bitterness, chalk, but with LOTS more coffee and vanilla essence.

472,"2012-02-20",3.3,"Pure blackness resides under the lasting beige sheet. As with other Maine Beer Co products, this stout is done with elegance. Its vanilla and cocoa components never feel exagerated, certainly without the slightest hint of artificiality. Roasted malts with a dose of resfreshing and never clashing acidity punctuate the aroma. Clean and powdery, almost chalky cocoa finish dries out the sweetish vanilla middle. Medium bitterness climbs up, seeming to come more from the roast than the soft earthy hops. Remaning easy to drink through and through despite the relative thickness. The rather active, albeit small-bubbled carbonationseems to help drinkability, contributing to cutting through the chocolatey sweetness. A good stout, but without the lively and fresh character I dig so much in their pale ales.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

472,"2012-02-13",3.6,"500ml bottle, dated 11/10/2011 and aged about 3 months.  The pour yields a dark, slightly translucent cola-mahogany body.  A thick cap of khaki colored froth sits at the head, showing excellent retention and leaving a dense, tattered swath of cobweb lacing behind.  Aromas are based in nicely toasted barley malt, hinting at coffee and toasted bread, and loaded with dry roasted cacao beans.  Vanilla sits on the periphery, staying out of the way from the roast cocoa scents.  The flavor largely follows suit, showcasing chocolate and coffee roast prominently, bitterness trumping the subtle, toasty caramel sweetness underneath.  I really dont get much vanilla at all, but thats not necessary a bad thing.  The mid-note is long and biting, with a decidedly oaty-cocoa finish.  In the mouth, the moderate body sports a smooth, very slightly milky-chalky consistency, with a nice, soft carbonation.  Theres a hint of acidity as well, reminiscent of aging coffee.  Overall, its quite a solid brew, but it certainly isnt life changing.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

The vanilla is properly subtle, supporting, and not gimicky or overwhelming, a first for vanilla in beer for me. Minimal warmth, good integration.

Pours fairly light for a stout, settling in as a dark opaque chestnut with a small off-white head that recedes to a wispy cap.

Aroma is a really nice mixture of roasted black malts, cocoa powder and vanilla beans.  There is also a slightly more sweet milk chocolate character to the owe as it warms.

Taste is more of the same and really excellent for a regular stout.  Its got the backbone of roasted malts with a layer of sweet chocolate and vanilla on top.  Lightly roasted and dry finish.

The mouthfeel is the one drawback for me as its a little on the thin side for a stout with decent carbonation.
