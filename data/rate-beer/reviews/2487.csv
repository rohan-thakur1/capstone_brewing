2487,"2016-12-30",3.1,"500ml bottle - thanks martjoobolut and ultimately his secret santa SinH4!
Bready, floury, a touch creamy lactic aroma. Just at its BB, so not as fresh as it could be, but not off at all. A touch of nuttiness too. Light refreshing palate, but carbonation a bit high. Very herbal hoppiness, a touch strawey. Malts lower than I expected given the breadiness of the aroma. Lacticity quite obvious too. Good thirst-quencher. Finish has an excellent bitter bite, quite a citrussy little tingle. Would love to try a fresh one straight from the tap, this has clearly passed its peak.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

2487,"2016-08-07",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 17, 2016 Barrel at StÃ¶hrenkeller. (?) Bright straw-golden color with creamy white head. Aroma is slightly hoppy, hints of butter, a bit hayish, crackery, citrusy. Taste is slight butter, noble hops, light grainy sweetness, crackers again, citrusy, hints of pepper, and a crisp finish. Perfectly balanced refreshing Franconian goodness, but it?s not as mind-blowing (in the sense of ""special"") as you might expect - nevertheless, rightfully on top of the Zwickel/Keller/Landbier ranking, it?s one of these masterfully crafted beers that convince you with their subtlety. I don?t think one can make a simple beer of this style any tastier, fresher, more refined or more balanced. A pinnacle of Landbier, this is a beer that can probably only be fully enjoyed in Franconia, when the GemÃ¼tlichkeit of the region has found its way into your mind after you have absorbed the beautiful landscape. I can hardly imagine this holding up well in a bottle. But that?s part of the game: This beer is made for savouring the moment, and you are going to want to come back to have it accompany many more moments. 8-4-10-5-18

Bottle, around one week old, September 2016. Pours a slightly hazy straw-golden color with a creamy white head. Aroma is a bit yeasty, grainy, slight hoppiness. Taste is the same. Creamy mouthfeel. It is amazing, but not as stellar as I remember it. Would probably be a 8-4-8-5-17.

Bottle at the brewery. Yes, this is *the* Lager. Spicier and more crackery malts than the Vollbier. Incredible drinkability.

LetÂ’s do this: I got a crate at the brewery and will do the experiment how this develops over a month. 3 days after buying: Quite bitter, a bit metallic, but still a soft fruitiness shining through. Took me a few sips to worship it.

One week after buying it from the brewery. It does indeed become a bit gulpy (a bit maybe due to the fact that it?s been transported today). Still quite an assertive bitterness, a nice fruitiness and a soft mouthfeel paired with a crackery malt body, so it?s still an amazing brew - still 4.x material. Let?s see how long it stays like this.

Bottle, 10 days old: it starts to become a bit less integrated, a bit ""grainier"" (or: ""beerier"", as my mom would say), but still nice. Not 4+ material anymore (at least not this particular bottle), though.

Bottle, 15 days old: Aroma is grainy, fruity, a bit gulpy. Quite juicy, but still not perfectly balanced anymore. Still fine though. Would probably be a 3.6-3.8.

Bottle, 23 days old: similar vocabulary. A bit grainier and less integrated. Still a good beer, but one would not see it as the best Kellerbier anymore.

Bottle, 28 days old: didnÂ’t lose a lot. I have the impression this beer loses a lot within two weeks and then stays constant for a while after that. However, I did cool it all the time.","Garching b. MÃ¼nchen, GERMANY","SinH4"

A sweet honey breadiness, cereal, light grain, a sweet, fruity tangerine/peachiness, and a soft grassiness paired with a light herbal character make up a beautiful, delicate aroma. Smooth, moderately dry entry with a soft honey sweetness leads into a bready, lightly grainy middle with a moderate spiciness that follows into the dry, grassy finish where itÂ’s paired with a moderately sweet, lush tangerine fruitiness and a light touch of earthy spiciness. Smooth, full mouthfeel without feeling heavy on the palate. ItÂ’s dry and biting on the finish that begs you to drink more...literally. I could drink as much of this as you could put in front of me.

2487,"2013-06-16",4.2,"Multiple draught half-liters at Witzgall Keller in May 2013: Orangish with golden highlights. Seductive Spalter aromas of sassafras, Japanese persimmon, Russian sage, candied fennel and a hint of candied pecan. Divinely green, flowery and perfumey, as well. Soft, dense carbonation. Boisterous licorice-laced hop grip merges with richly woody hop depth and a stiff clench of minerals. Substantial pepperiness enhances the mineral character. Luscious charge of esters and peach puree arise as elegantly sweet, hop-derived nectars gracefully ooze forth and lap the palate. Generous dose of bouncy, new-mown hay softens the crunchier Munich textures  and cleanly supports the superabundant wood-root-spice hoppiness. Ongoing estery succulence accompanies a vibrant splash of ripe peach, fuzz and all. Sophisticated maltiness exudes throughout, despite the hopcentricity. Dry, mineral-rich finish is beautifully lined with dusty yeast and a bitterly herbaceous hop bite, along with intricately malty notes of cookie, breadcrust, brisk Munich-derived toffee, and even a trace of unsweetened chocolate. A supremely drinkable, strikingly complex and characterful lager thatÂ’s certainly one of the hoppiest Franconia has to offer. This particular pocket of Franconia has some of the finest water in the region, and although it takes more than great water to make great beer, it is no coincidence that some of the finest brewers are situated here (Lieberth, Roppelt, Witzgall, Rittmayer Hallerndorf). Righteously rustic! It is worth noting that bottles purchased at the brewery fared comparatively poorly and were quite dull.

Softly hoppy aroma with just a touch of bread.  ItÂ’s lovely.  Really good bite on the finish.  The finish is just like a great pilsner.  Some very good lemon on this too.  I am completely floored that the 2 lagers that Fin brought back for me.  They have been completely wonderful and just make me wish all lager could be this good and that we could get this great distribution here in the UK.  Touch of earthy lemon herbiness on aroma.  Re-rate draft at the Keller.  Drank 3 in an hour.  Love this beer.  DidnÂ’t mind I was bitten 10 times by mozzies, I loved this beer.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

2487,"2008-10-30",4.2,"Thanks for the hopjuice pivnizub! 
Strong grassy and perfumed hop nose. Cludy yellow, huge lacing white head, quite a bit pressure behind it. Grassy herbal and citric hops in the foreground of the taste as well, light grain in the center, then quickly off to a aromatic grassy finish. Light yeasty fruityness, then grass again. Medium to light sparkly body, the bubbly champagne mouthfeel fits the aromatic light brew. Excellent!","Garching b. MÃ¼nchen, GERMANY","jonas"

2487,"2008-10-02",4.0,"[bottle--thanks, pivnizub!]
Potent noble hops aroma that is a bit spicy and full of sweet malt and hay--maybe a touch of caramel. Hazy golden orange with a lasting, rocky, white head. Full of flavour: nearly caramelly base malt that is sweet but totally in balance with tons of hops that are practially spicy and just a touch salty. All of this is complimented nicely with hefty carbonation. Extremely quaffable and clean. Medium body.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"
2487,"2008-08-13",4.8,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2016 Bottled at the brewpub.  Pale golden, small head. Grassy minerally nose- Dry and slim, a bit fruity. Less malty and less soft than their Vollbier. Minerals and hops are more evident instead, but results in a less drinkable beer.

Re-rate, keg at Akkurat, Stockholm.  Hazy golden, rich firm head. Grassy, spicy nose with mild fruitiness. Dry with light-medium body and crisp, well rounded mouthfeel. Grassy, spicy hops, mildly minerally. Gentle, seamless, yet hoppy. Salty bitter finish. Very moreish. Far better than the bottle at the brewery. In fact delicious. To be honest - delicious beyond belief.","TyresÃ¶, SWEDEN","omhper"

2487,"2006-06-11",4.4,"HereÂ’s to a remarkably pure light golden color that shines despite its haze and produces a perfect rocky, large white head. Generous yeast/hop interplay greets the nose with delicate hay touches blending in dry typically german floral aromatics and a light earthy background.  Balance completed by typical bright zesty lemon/grapefruit notes. Superb example, more or less what a wallonian belgian pils, pseudo-saison should aspire to, beauty in simplicity. Foamy, expansive carbonation manages to remain unagressive while almost easing the already ridiculously easy-going quaffable character. Wondrous ending leaves us with a pinch of pepper that begs for further study.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2487,"2006-05-23",4.6,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2014 Impressions from the hof:
-Great bobbing foam recedes swiftly into the krug.
-Grapefruity, spicy, floral and herbal hops form a seductive perfume and flavor profile.
-Grassy, peppery hop bitterness surveys the back of the tongue for quite a while.
-The refined, silky straw-like malts are perfectly balanced by the engaging hoppiness.
-Active, but soft carbonation serves the delicate body well.
-One of the most tasteful, sÃ¼ffig of Franconian lagers. A true masterpiece of drinkability.

Bottles, at the brewery, at CafÃ© Abseits, and back home.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
