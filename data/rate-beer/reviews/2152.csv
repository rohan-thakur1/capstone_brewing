Taste is initially slightly sweet and a bit meaty, turning into a bittersweet and slightly salty finish. Full body, oily texture, flat carbonation. Quite a strange drink, no idea if its supposed to be carbonated or not but this one certainly wasnt. Aroma itself was nice but taste somewhat unpleasant. Still finishable and not as sweet as sahti usually is, not sure if Im ever able to like the style even though I try every few years or so.

2152,"2014-02-08",3.7,"Kaatuu lasiin ruskeanoranssina ja hyvin sameana (hiivojen kanssa) ja käytännössä vaahdottomana, kuten asiaan kuuluukin. Tasapainoisessa hajussa iskevät melko tasapainoisesti banaanisuus, hiivaleipäisyys ja jopa mansikkaisuus. Lievää mausteisuuttakin on havaittavissa. Maussa on havaittavissa samoja elementtejä, nyt kuitenkin hiiviasuus on voimakkaimpana ja banaani jää jopa mansikan taakse. Mausteisuuskin nousee vahvemmin esille, mutta nyt loppumaussa tuntuu karviaismaisuutta mukavana happamuutena. Suutuntuma on melko täyteläinen ja petollisen helppo, vaikka alkoholi tuntuu hieman. Humalointi puraisee selvästi ja jää kutittelemaan suuhun. Hieno sahti, jossa hieman rankempi humalointi toimii vallan mainiosti ja tuo uutta syvyyttä tähän olueen.","FINLAND","fantti"
