495,"2017-05-06",3.7,"Keg @ Blue Moon, Madison. Really strong vanilla on the nose. Toasted marshmallows, smores. Caramelized prune. Creme brûlée. Unique aroma. Flavor is sweet and fairly hot. Strong vanilla lends more creme brûlée character. Rocky road fudge. Hot and woody finish. Oily, soft carb. Interesting gear thats a bit too heavy on the vanilla for me.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
495,"2017-05-06",4.0,"On tap at Blue Moon. Pours black with an earthy brown head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a strong vanilla note with strong roasted malts supporting and hints of dark grains, whiskey and a bit of almond backing. Flavor starts with strong vanilla and is supported by roasted malts, dark grains, almond and whiskey.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
495,"2017-03-24",4.1,"Tap at Clubhouse BFD. Pours black, creamy looking tan head. Aroma is bourbon, vanilla bean ice cream (really delicious aromatic), caramel, butterscotch, excellent. Flavor is vanilla beans, chocolate, espresso beans, bourbon in the back, but not too heavy. Very vanilla heavy. Some coffee bitterness finish. Body is smooth, silky. Excellent.","New York, USA","SG111"

495,"2017-01-03",4.2,"Tap at world of beer in Cary. Dark look, thinner tan head, pretty black color. Big aromas of whiskey, malt, chocolate, wood, super chocolate, alcohol, big and rich. The taste is rich, smooth, vanilla, malt ballls, and great.","Dallas, Texas, USA","travita"
495,"2017-01-02",4.0,"Pours dark brown/black with ruby edges. Not a typical mouthfeel of a stout, with big vanilla finish. Actually like a vanilla shake.","Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA","Fujimo2000"
495,"2016-12-09",4.0,"On tap at Barleys. Comes black with a small tan head. Aroma of malt, whiskey, chocolate, and vanilla. Taste is roasted malt, whiskey, vanilla, coffee, and a bit of coffee. Excellent.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
495,"2016-12-07",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2017 On tap at Barleys in Shawnee, KS alongside Black Note and barrel aged Neptune. Aroma is whiskey and vanilla throughout with a slight roasted malt. Appearance is black with a minimal khaki head which dissipated quickly. Taste is whiskey up front followed by roasted malt and chocolate - finishes with lots of oak then vanilla takes over and remains for several minutes. I truly enjoyed the lingering vanilla aftertaste. Body is medium to heavy. Overall a killer barrel aged stout which actually preferred over Black Note during this tapping. Would be awesome if they bottled it so you could taste it a few years down the road and see if the whiskey aroma/flavors tamed any...","Kansas, USA","mikeymike"
495,"2016-11-26",4.0,"this was my surprise of the night. it was a vanilla smoothie. poured a dark opaque brown with plenty of chocolate, oak, whiskey, vanilla and it drinks so smooth and delicious. that vanilla bean is just the right amount that it doesnt over power the total flavor. very very good. it is a nice touch to have whiskey instead of bourbon flavor mixed in.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","tmongoose"
495,"2016-11-25",3.8,"Really strong aroma and vanilla taste. Pretty smooth to drink. Probably not more than one.","louisville, Kentucky, USA","bubblehouse"
495,"2016-10-09",3.7,"Sample at Roll Out the Barrel 2016. Aroma is vanilla beans, coffee, roasted malt, booze, barrel, eh. Appearance is black, light brown head, thickish. Taste is barrel, booze, vanilla, roasted malt, coffee, eh. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy body, light carbonation, barrel and vanilla aftertaste. Overall, this is ok.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"
495,"2016-10-09",4.1,"On draft at Roll Out the Barrel 2016. The pour is a medium black with a bit of ruby shining through and a thick light tan head that fades to a film leaving a good lace. The aroma is lovely. There is a sweet roast, light barrel and alcohol, and a great vanilla and chocolate presence. Its clean and pretty heavy on the vanilla, I like it. The flavor is really good. The vanilla is big and bright, but not dominatigly sweet. The cocoa and roasted malts balance with the oak and light alcohol. The mouth feel is light and softly carbonated and the aftertaste is sweet and smooth with a light alcohol and vanilla lingering behind. Real good","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
495,"2016-10-09",4.0,"Draft to taster at the Eccentric Cafe. Looks good; a translucent dark cola with foamy beige head. Smells good too; loads of chocolate alongside notes of oak and a bit of coffee and vanilla. Tastes like it smells with a medium full-bodied mouthfeel thats pleasantly smooth. Tasty.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
