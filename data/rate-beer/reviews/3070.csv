3070,"2017-04-23",4.0,"Pours a vibrant ember color with a huge, fluffy big head, which wont receed at all. 

Smells of rather light malts, enhancing the bright appearance of the beer, which gets enriched by prominent smoke and burned out camp fire. A hoppy undertone completes the nose by adding just a herbal note to the very inviting aromas.

Has a light, refreshing body with a lively carbonation, effectivly balancing the dominant smoke which becomes immediately apparent on the palate.

Establishes an early hazelnut earthiness with a good amount of roast, soothed by caramel and a touch of toffee. All of this gets amped up by the most prominent smokiness, which is like biting into a honeyed, grilled ham. Then the flavors take another turn, this time heading into a herbal, dry direction, together with an effervescent mineralic quality.

Awesome Rauch, intense and refreshing at the same time with a challenging flavor profile and a surprisingly dry, hop defined ending.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3070,"2017-04-18",4.1,"Bottle (2016 batch). Head is initially large, frothy, light brown, mostly lasting. Body is hazy medium brown.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation.

I bought a bottle of this online not knowing it was last years batch, and was depressed to see the neck label when I opened the box. Then I thought about the good experience I had with a 6-7 year old bottle of unfiltered Eiche, and crossed my fingers this would still have some life left in it too. And wow, does it ever! This is perhaps more enjoyable than even a homemade blend of Maerzen and Urbock (which is my favorite Schlenkerla), especially wrt the mouthfeel. Arrrgghhh, why doesnt Heller leave all their bottles unfiltered??? Maerzen is so thin and watery (and kinda fizzy too) from bottle. If they would just leave the magical yeast in there, that stuff would last on the shelf sooooo much better. This and the aged Eiche are all the evidence you need for that. Regardless, as good as this is at a year old, I hope to somehow get my hands on a 2017 bottle before the summers out.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Thick eggshell head, rising aggressively. Lovely hazy brown, clear light edges. Clean sweet malt and a smooth, delicious Schlenkerla smoke. Bitter brown malt flavors, flavorful and tasty Franconian style. Smoke is understated, especially compared to the other beers from this brewery. Fairly sweet wood and fruit, followed by a bracing bitterness. I wonder what this might have lost with age, and I look forward to revisiting it.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"

Mmm... Bacon-y! A very pleasant, easy-drinking Rauchbier, with strong but not overwhelming smokiness. Im really starting to appreciate Rauchbiers in general and the Aecht Schlenkerla lineup more specifically, and this is quite a nice example. The smokiness in particular is very well implemented, and comes across more as bacon curing (i.e. hardwood) than campfire (i.e. softwood). In fact, this might be an excellent place for neophytes to begin exploring Rauchbiers, given the overall quite mellow character. (16/20)","CANADA","UXO"

Settles a ruby chestnut, misted by proteins in suspension. A lofty, off-white head gets comfortable atop and laces a feverish film of foam in its wake. Aroma? Absolutely amazing. Perfektionieren is the robust nose offering hints of Cheetohs and Burger Rings crisps, smoked bacon and peat-charred beef, bonfire smoke, spiced Biltong and a strange inkling of fresh made, salty tapenade. A little tart berries on the palate deepen the complexity yet simplicity of this beer. It is light and racy across the tongue. The aroma is just a plug for all that grips the olfactories on and in the swallow. Smoked meat, charcuterie, peat, ash and a good whack of green peppercorns (?) give it spice and substance to draw at the saliva glands and refresh the palate.

Lovely nose of sweet smoked liquorice stick, woodsmoked salmon, caramel-cured meat and roots. Same balance of sweet and savoury in taste, fruity slowcured BBQ red apples, older maple syrup, along with a seamy-smooth yeast profile set it apart from the standard Märzen - not quite as chewy in mouthfeel as expected for the extra 0.5 abv though. Remarkable woody-dry finish, joining all kinds of natural bitterness. - ""Liquida non frangunt ieiunium"" indeed, but for those not fasting in autumn this particular masterpiece accompanies hearty smoked fish dishes even better. // Resampled from gravity cask at source, 2016-03: less sugary, all hues of damp, brackish and chthonic.

3070,"2015-08-15",5.0,"This is beer rating 5,000. I had the opportunity to go to Schlenkerla in April of 2013 and poured this beer into the glass I purchased from the brewery. I had been looking for this beer for several years prior to that holiday, and finally found it locally this spring. The appearance of this beer is excellent. It is an opaque brown color, with a lacing, off-white head. When held up to the light, it is a red color. Also of note is the lack of filtration, and the sediment and yeast can be seen in the beer. I like the aroma, lots of smoke, and while I usually do not jump to a description of roasted meat or bacon in rauchbier, I do pick up some of those aromas here. The taste cant be separated from the aroma. There is a lot of smoke of course; a light mineral character; dry malt and grain, and wood at the end. Aftertaste is lasting smoke and more dry malt. Full flavor and full palate, which no doubt benefits from the lack of filtration. I do not throw perfect scores out, but this beer was everything I hoped for, therefore it is called for here. Rauchbier has come to be one of my favorite styles, and it is going to be a challenge to find one better than this.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"

3070,"2015-07-21",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
This powerfully smoky Rauchbier remains very drinkable through lean cereal sugars, peppery hop suggestions and salty connotations.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A healthy head of foam lingers atop the misty amber.
-This may not be very complex but it is wonderfully unique. No other brewery in Franconia has smoked beers of this ilk.
-Mouthfeel is soft and feels natural (nothing feels forced).
-This is another excellent Schlenkerla brew; no surprise, here, but tons of pleasure!

3070,"2015-06-03",3.7,"16.9 oz. bottle, consumed on 6-3-15. Clear in initial pour, hazy in later pours. Brown to very dark amber with a brass hue. Large amount of fluffy, taupe head. Good and extensive lacing. Looks really good, especially in color. Smoky, meaty aroma. Pomegranate scent. Quite likable, standard Rauchbier aroma; I wish it were stronger. Smoky, campfire flavor matches the aroma. Baked apple. Mineral, malty lager underneath the smoke. Bacon-like, umami, sweet, and dry finish. Smoky effect gets weaker upon multiple sips, and I want it to be stronger. Light body. Watery, excessively aqueous palate effects. Some fizziness but lacks the crispness that a lager should have. Overall, subpar for a Schlenkerla (and, to be clear, I love rauchbiers), but well above average overall. The aroma and flavor are good but could be better by being stronger, and the insubstantial palate is a drag.

The nose is dominated by smokey and meaty notes, not too over the top, but certainly very much present. A hint of smoked Provola and some generic toffee/caramel presence. Taste pretty much follow suite, I was expecting a more extreme/complex beer, but its quite simple even if still dynamic. Chestnut honey like sweetness, super high drinkability, lingering toasted and campfire smoke taste with some fried bacon reminiscence. It does get slightly cloying toward the end, but I find it an acceptable and minor detail. Soft carbonation, light to medium body, slightly oily texture. Nice indeed.","Rome / Lecce, ITALY","Ragnampiza"

Slightly hazy dark copper appearance with a soft tan head. Aroma is very thick. Some meatiness (bacon / pork) but not like their Märzen. A bit of ash present.

Very thick and porridge-like flavor / mouth feel. Nicely dry without a ton of residual sugars. Very doughy / bready flavor. Hints of fruity notes. Some black pepper spiciness, especially on the finish. Definitely some caramel and ash, but again, not all that sweet. Super smooth finish. Slightly chalky.

A: Cloudy, reddish orange hues. Small to medium head with little lacing.

S: This is where all Aecht Schlenkerla beers excel. This beer smells like a beautiful late summer campfire. Charred meat, heavy smoke, summer sausage, and burnt malt.

T: The taste falls directly in line with the aroma. This isnt necessarily a complex brew, but it has amazing, unique flavors that make this beer a must try. It has similarities to a fine Islay scotch, like Lagavulin. Its like drinking in a campfire. Really tasty, and pairs very well with strong cheeses and meat.

This beer arrives from the tap with a huge head (at least for a tap beer), it is two-fingers in height, quite structurally solid looking, leaves lots of lacing as it subsides and is a light tan color.  Big smoke aromatics are noticeable from the get go.  The beer itself is an almost brilliantly clear when held up to the light where it shows a deep red-amber color; as it sits on the table it is a dark plum  color.  Rich smoke aromatics that leans towards almost salty / brine-like in character, while some of the malt character seems to soften the smokiness in the finish.

All the carbonation seems to have been knocked out of this beer during its service from the tap, so it is quite smooth feeling, but it still has some viscous heft to it.  The smoke flavors are more subtle than the aroma would have suggested, but it is still the dominant note (especially in the finish).  Up front there is a nice, sweet maltiness that helps to balance the smoke.  There are almost some berry like flavors to this beer; perhaps from the maillard maltiness that is not really caramel, but definitely rich.  Flavors of umami and peat-smoke (even though this is beechwood smoked malt) are also noticeable here.  This is definitely a beer that has a big smoke character to it, but I am a sucker for beers like this so it definitely hits the spot.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

In long: Nose is very smoky with a smoke signature that is halfway between bacon/ham and wood.  The beer is a little less smoky than the two Schlenkerla classics (Urbock and Marzen).  Taste has crisp caramel, bread crust, smoked bacon, smoked almonds, smoked wood.  The finish is short, dryer and more astringent than other Schlenkerla beers.

Pint at the Bavarian Lodge. Pours a dark brown red with thick lacing and a firm white head. The classic Schlenkerla smoked bouquet is here with defined, clean, mouthwatering bacon, wood smoke, and campfire. I cant get over the remarkable clarity and balance. The flavor is strongly smoky with the same unbeatable smoked quality only Schlenkerla can provide. Perhaps this is less intense than their marzen, but that isnt really saying much. Nonetheless,  the meaty bacon and campfire flavor is still in full effect. The palate is light and clean with a lasting finish of smoke that tries to fade to a mildly sweet malt hint. Excellent.

Pint glass at the Local Option. How lucky am I to try this beer twice in a week? Im equally as impressed as the first time I had it. The true, complex smoke is all over the place.

Not overdone, just enough. Initial is a nice sweet maltiness of bread and biscuits moving into bacon, campfire, a sweet wood, not ashy, but a pleasant smoke on the palate. The smoke and sweet malts linger on the palate, full flavor but a lighter bodied lager than is quite quaffable. Reminds me of bacon buns, this is a wonderfully drinkable smoked lager, light yet the unfiltered nature gives it some great flavor.

Dense lasting good looking cream colored to tan head. Very very nice malty sweet and of course heavily smoked sausage like, almost metallic, soot scent.

Smooth a bit full mouthfeel. Medium bitterenss. Apart from the smoke, a very well balanced beer. Though I love the high smoke content, so I will not complain about it!Now I feel like next year perhaps Ill plan to visit Bamberg during that time of year when this beer is supposed to be on, really want to try it fresh from the source, I believe that really would taste amazing.9/5/7/4/17=4.2Rerate, second ratingDraught at Ölrepubliken, Göteborg, on May 6, 2011How lucky am I to walk in for a few quick beers and find this!Slight bit hazy brown color, nice creamy lasting big tan head.

3070,"2010-02-24",4.7,"Ive been searching for this beer for years and actually had a chance to try it last year during Philly Beer Week. It was on tap at the Yards brewery during the Smoke Em If You Got Em festival. I arrived an hour after the event began and it was already gone. Curses! I heard that this was on at Bierkraft in Brooklyn so I drove there today to pick up a couple of growlers. I love this brewery and this is the only beer they brew that I havent had yet. Im very excited to finally get to try it.

Pours a cloudy, dark copper/mahogany color with dark, golden ruby/orange hues when held to a light source and a two finger soapy, light yellowish-beige head that has excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap. Sporadic chunks of soapy lacing are left behind.

Another amazing smelling beer from Schlenkerla. Lots of smokey toasted malt with hints of campfire, earthy oak, barbecue and bacon. Although the rauch/smoke notes dominate the nose, it is not one dimensional at all. There are hints of earthy oak, caramel malt, bready yeast and faint hops. Of these later characteristics, the oak and caramel are most prevalent. Its a nice change of pace to be able to smell something other than butane in this style of beer. Dont get me wrong I love smoke bombs but the nose on this beer is very complex and unlike any other beer of the style that Ive come across before.

Full bodied which is not surprising for a lent beer but I still wasnt expecting the mouthfeel to be so dense. Nice and smokey yet still well balanced by other flavors making it extremely complex and drinkable. Slightly nutty with lots of toasty malt and bready yeast notes contributing to the full body with a surprisingly strong oak presence and some nice crisp hop bitterness. The hop presence was much more prominent that I had expected and it was a very pleasant surprise. Although these other flavors are present, this beer is still dominated by smoked malt. Lots of smokey campfire flavor with hints of bacon, barbecue, charcoal and burnt toast. As in the nose, there are a lot of different elements contributing to the complexity of this beer. In one sip you get smoke, oak, nut, caramel and bitter dry hops all complimenting each other without anything becoming to overpowering, even the smokiness. Incredibly quaffable and absolutely delicious. Highly recommended!","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

It has a small but dense and long-lasting off-white head that leaves thick lacing on the glass.  The flavor includes a nice fruity maltiness and floral/noble hoppiness with a great layer of campfire smoke sitting on top.  I really like the charred wood character that also has hints of smoky beef jerky.  It is dry with a slight bitterness that lingers.  This beer is medium-bodied and soft and smooth on the palate.

The smoke is forefront, but not overwhelming. Also some light fruit sweetness is present to even out the smoke and malt.  As with the nose, nicely integrated and melded.  Very tasty.  Palate is medium, slightly mouth coating, with an interesting slight bitterness to the finish. Super drinkable.  Wow, really great, thanks for all of the effort on this Brandon.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

Pours a slightly hazy brownish orange with a decent tan head that lingers and rouses easily.  Aroma is an intense smoke, meat, light caramel, and campfire, this might be the most intense and interesting smoked aroma Ive smelled yet.  Flavor is more meat, smoke, and light caramel, and is very drinkable.  Excellent stuff, especially on a cool evening, and no doubt my highest rated smoked beer to date.

3070,"2009-04-18",4.1,"Draft at Uber. Pours a crystal clear dark maple-y brown. Towering, thick, fluffy tan head that takes forever to settle. Our man on the case behind the bar had knives, spoons, spare pitchers, spare stanges, and plenty of banter at the ready to manage people while he poured stanges of this one. It looks watery and perfectly translucent, but, man, it billows. Great big fat campfire, bacon, and beef jerky nose--all that smoke finds every possible way to show off in the aromatics, as you might expect. Creamy medium body. Smoke hits you right off the attack. Theres some doughy malt under that, and bits of nitrogen, which is rather unfortunate. Plenty of smoke riding shotgun over all, though. Another big smoky delight from Aecht--never get tired of their rauchy goodness.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
3070,"2009-04-18",4.4,"Draft at Uber.  Pours a clear but deep rich brown color with amber tints a big fluffy off white head.  Man, I could smell the smoke on this one as Ken placed it on the coaster in front of me.  Aroma is slightly sweet with malt and caramel and then just deep inviting smoke.  Not the kind of smoke that makes you want to switch your position around the campfire, but the kind of smoke that you get with fantastic piece of smoked meat or fish.  As I drink this one, it reminds me of a mix between the Märzen and the Helles.  All the smokey goodness of the Märzen but with a lighter body and the refreshing crispness of the Helles; super drinkable.

2013 update: Ive had it old now from a shameless bar in San Diego.  I hear some bars sit on it for 3-6 months.  It needs to be fresh, just like the helles, marzen and wheat. So it feels like it could be anywhere between 4.2 and 3.2 depending on the shape its in.  Schlenkerla does produce some dud batches now and then, Ive seen it in their rauch bock and marzen.

3070,"2008-03-14",4.1,"On tap @ redlight. Holy campfire, Batman! I was excited to try this (first smoked beer, much less German rauchbier), but when I got my first whiff, I was worried I had gotten in over my head. It smells like your clothes do the morning after a huge bonfire. It was stupefying that a beer could smell like that. However, I proceeded to take a sip, assuming my mouth would be engulfed with smoke. Much to my surprise, a very balanced flavor. Smoke on the front, a solid malty middle, and a mild hop presence at the end. A good ten second flavor. I was left feeling the slight tingling in my mouth wondering if it was the hops or the smoke (probably both), but either way it was enjoyable. Poured a rich copper with a white head. I would be quite happy if I could have a few of these every Lent season, though not all on the same night. Brent, thanks so much for bringing this to Orlando.","San Francisco, California, USA","cmillward"

Im so thankful that I got to try this rarity at the best bar in the business, thanks Brent!The pour yields a clear, dark, rusty brown amber with a foamy, cream colored head.  Well retained, the foam slowly recedes, leaving thick sheets of lacing behind.  The smokiness is softer than some of Aechts other products, yet still pervasive throughout each and every element.  Notes of salted BBQ pork, dirt, earthy hops, and minerals are all drawn together by a binding Alderwood smoke.  Caramelized malts lay the groundwork, adding sweetness, while the smoke level is soft enough to let the earthen hops really shine.  Medium bodied, well balanced, and incredibly drinkable, I could session this brew all day long.

3070,"2007-05-01",3.7,"Tap at Wildeman, Amsterdam.  Attractive brown, amber in direct light, with a one-finger very dense tan-tinged foam.  Aroma is predominantly campfire smoke and smoked meats, with a faint and pleasing caramel malt sweetness.  The scent here is much more subdued than other Aecht offerings Ive sampled - a little more rounded and balanced, a little less smoke-forward.  Taste hints at smoke upfront and that smoke characteristic just pleasingly lingers through the whole experience, never thrusting itself onto center stage but always accentuating the main players, which in this case are grassy, mildly bitter hops and a distinctive chewy malt presence.  An excellent mix of sweet and savory (really savory!) here, and a testament to the amazing balance a solid rauchbier can achieve:  they dont all have to be smoke bombs that slap you across the face with links of sausage.","Ithaca, New York, USA","dmradus"

Sweet and smoky nose.  Interesting flavors--smoky bacon on top of slightly sweet malts, with dark bread, caramel, wood, earth and even some cherry and red apple peel.  Mild smokiness left on the tongue, which is actually mild and savory as opposed to harsh and cured. Smooth bodied but actually rich and filling-- probably the most ""wholesome"" tasting beer Ive had.  Would be perfect for breakfast.

Clear, reddish/amber-y hue, firm cushion of cottony, off-white head holds court above. 

Aroma: sausage, pepporoni, ham sammiches...smo-KEY! Boisterous smoked malt aroma, meaty, beaty, big, & bouncy, with light noble hops accompanying.

Taste: smooth & malty, but fully flavorful, juicy malt entertains the tastebuds, fruity flavors bump in for a bit, hops are light, body is medium, and the finish is long and malty.

Smokey feel persists, but remains mellow in the mouth. Long lasting, malt has a marzen feel to it...not sure what style ""fastenbier"" is supposed to be...a Lenten fasting beer?

Smells amazing.  Flavour is great as well, soft texture shows off the lightly kilned malts to their utmost, with the smoke serving to accent the inherent sweetness.

3070,"2006-04-03",4.2,"On draught at Redbones, 4/1/06.  From what I gather, this years batch wasnt quite as enjoyable as last years.A beer of low filtration, but this has settled out to be nearly clear, with a bright orange hue hididng behind deep amber-auburn.  Moderate amount of bubbles rising in the liquid creates a small, beige head that is neatly retained at cover, with a touch of lace.The nose is the most softly understated smokiness I have encountered in a long time.  Not in your face like the Urbock, and not even as strong as the marzen, but still just full, lasting and refreshing, filling the nostrils with applewood smoked bacon, smoked almonds, sweet vanilla cream and daintily arousing further curiousity with graceful, yet spicy hop notes on the end, coupled with light candied apples, pinches of cinnamon sprinkled overtop oranges and a fresh unpasteurized yeastiness.The flavor combines a roasted meat fullness with an almost cheddar cheese-like robustness and deep saltiness.  Things never get out of hand nor do they become overdone, as the hops are well apparent, bringing leafy, hay-like spices, tangy as well, but with bright herbal notes emerging on the end, in time.  Never too heavy in the mouth, but with just enough unfiltered chewiness and the signature oiliness (which is light here) from the smoked malts.  Tending towards the sweeter side of things, but playful, moreso than heavy, with sweet fruit notes adding a livliness I dont remember from the other Schlenkerlas.  No alcohol anywhere.  Very cohesive, homogenized beer, well-balanced and tastefully done in all aspects.

3070,"2005-04-08",4.7,"UPDATED: APR 10, 2005 04.07.05  16oz, hand-bottled from growler by TAR.  Hazed chestnut, glowing.  Sports a creamy khaki head mixed with some sizeable bubbles despite the stress its been put through in its short life.  Aroma is deep with woodsmoke, hints of brine, more smoke, ripe grain, layer after layer of smoke, and something of a caramelized fruit quality (raisin?).  First sip and wow!  Now this is a session beer!  As dominant as the smoke is on the nose, on the palate this seems more like an alt with some definite toasty (pretzel) notes and a bit salty.  Smoke is integrated beautifuly to simply play into the overall impression.  And while more heavily smoked than the majority of smoked brews seem to be, its maybe the least smoky of the Aecht Schlenkerlas that Ive tried.  The body is soft, very wet and refreshing; hints of tangy hops bitterness on the back of the palate.  Damn, this stuffs invigorating.  I feel younger for having drunk this ambrosia.  Thank you Jeff!After dreaming about this beer for the last couple of nights, Ive come to realize that I grossly underated the stuff.  Ive been waking with the DTs thinking about smoke.  Previous rating 4.3","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
3070,"2005-04-04",4.4,"Definitely smoked meat and banana ~ my first impressions.  Sweeter and less dry than other smoked beers Ive had. Slightly roasty with peaty undertones and some sort of caramel mocha. Amazing flavor. Tried to distinguish whether the raisin/current tones were just in the aroma but couldnt. Tasted them too.  Fairly subtle finish, so so close to perfect with lingering slightly metallic and burnt sugar. Im not the biggest fan of smoked beers and wouldve probably listed it as my least favorite style. This is truly multidimensional  and amazing.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
3070,"2005-04-04",3.9,"Tap at Brewkettle 4/4/05.  Ruddy brown red color with a whispy off white head.  Enormous smoke aroma, with underlying tobacco and spicy hops.  Produces a slightly sweet malt aroma as it warms.  Burstiing with smoke flavors, this is incredibly complex.  Slightest smoke meat flavor, but mainly rauchmalt.   Lightly malty with an incredibly clean, earthy bitter finish.  This is assertively hopped, for sure, but never up front with the hop presence.  Certainly luck to have had the chance to sample this.","Reno, Nevada, USA","NVBeer232"
3070,"2005-04-02",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 14, 2016 Draft: Unfiltered auburn. Loose but sticky off-gray foam. Fascinating nose chock-full of bready malt and honey-glazed smoked prosciutto. Faint leather, anise, and burnt toffee. Softly lush carbonation. Dash of acidity immediately deepens the rich smoke flavor. Thoroughly complex malt notes teem with sticky caramel drippings that segregate the mineral grittiness and lush, malt dust-laced foundation. Perfect level of datelike sweetness cuts the smoked poultry tang, but the attenuation magically remains impeccable. Finishes clean as a whistle but with an equally-rustic edge of ashen wood notes slowly cushioned by caramel and fresh bread as smoky phenolic whispers develop alongside firm herbal-accented hop bitterness and a neatly-tucked spicy anise punch. An other-worldly rauchbier, and perhaps the best smoked session beer on the planet. Previous score from 2003 was a 4.6 overall, but over the years and eight visits to Franconia, my love for Brauerei Heller has waned. More often than not, I find their rauch character to be kind of ashy and meaty (I want melanoidins and breadcrust instead of ""hammy"" qualities in my rauchbier), thin and fruity.  The last bottle I opened was infected in a cool way, with band-aid phenols and a huge head, but not sour or acidic; rather, quite lively and plenty fresh. While my tastes have certainly evolved, this is still a very enjoyable beer, just not as compelling or singular as it seemed 12 or so years ago when I was much more effusive and impressionable.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3070,"2005-04-02",3.8,"Big bubbly head that wonderful smoked aroma, the unique Aecht smoked taste with a lightly overtoned malt flavors. Smooth as silk body. While I prefer the Ur Bock because of its heavier malt body this is just fine. Great for someones first rauch experience. Kudoos to Jeff for getting this on tap at Landmark in Milwaukee","Muskego, Wisconsin, USA","brewblackhole"
3070,"2005-03-27",4.2,"On tap at Maxs in Baltimore.  Clear, bronze appearance with a creamy, dense,  off white head and very nice lacing.  The smoky aroma, with hints of leather,  was relatively mild in comparison to the Urbock.  Full bodied mouthfeel with an earthy, peaty flavor.  Modest to average carbonation.  Decently hopped but not as intense as some of the other Schlenderlas.  Like comparing an IPA to a IIPA.  Good one to have if its your first smoked beer.  Everything falls into place from appearance to finish.","Hanover, Maryland, USA","guzzler67"
3070,"2005-03-25",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2007 On Tap at the DillyDeli.  Well made smoked.  Smokey aroma similar to hickory barbecue, meaty(like sausage).   Color is a dark brown almost porter like.  Thin frothy head that didnt seem to dissipate.    This would be a fantastic beer to drink with a plate of German sausage, moderately sharp cheddar cheese and maybe some German Rye bread.  Flavor is slightly acidic from the smoke malt.  Thanks to the Dilly Deli for getting this Lent treat.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
3070,"2005-03-25",4.0,"Draft. Poured a clear dark amber with small tan head. Aroma was strong pleasent smokey. The flavor had a medium smoke taste with a malty long finish. As a cigar smoker, I found this brew very refreshing.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3070,"2005-03-22",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2005 Hand-bottled from a keg and sent to me by The_Beer_God. (Hand-bottled! Not available in official bottled form.)Lots of work it seems to get this one. Well it is Easter week Jesus is still alive and kicking only to be nailed up in 3 days. Sounds like a good time for a beer. Very nice murky burnt mahogany body, topped by a creamy light tan head. The aroma of smoked meat is massive all through the pour. Further olfactory investigation turns up some sausage, campfire, and some light sweetness coming in late. Wow nice aroma. The flavor is hugely smokey and chewy. I feel like I could tear into this beer with my teeth and chew. Its the beer that drink likes a meal, perfect for a fast! Some sweetness and breadiness in there but the story here is the smoked game. Very soft palate with some light bitterness throughout. The smokiness lasts and lasts. What an interesting beer. Again, major kudos to the Tidewater crew for getting this one and sending some up my way! And oh yeah, if you do not like a smoked beer this is probably not one that is going to change your mind.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"
3070,"2005-03-22",4.2,"Thanks to The_ Beer_ God for the invite to the party to enjoy this beauty. You gotta love smoked beers to enjoy this. Beautiful copper color with just the right amount of smokiness-present and tasty but not as overpowering as the marzen or urbock. Full and rich with subtle hints of hops on the finish. It was worth the trouble to obtain!","Smithfield, Virginia, USA","bonvivant"
3070,"2005-03-18",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 21, 2005 HUGE thanks to Mike at Bon Vivant for all the work in getting this for me, and Chris from Associated Distributing for letting me borrow the draft set up. Keg. CO2 draft. Hazed copper with splashes of mahogany throughout. Small tan head. Relaxed smokiness, light wafts of smoked sausage notes, smoldering wood, and hints of sweet malts are all abound in the aroma. Taste is smoked malts, light meaty notes, smoked wood, light bitterness, faint hints of fruit, and some notes of grain. Body is creamy and smooth with a lingering smoky note and light bitterness. Finishes with more smoked malts, light burnt wood, notes of caramel and light bitterness. Nice!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
