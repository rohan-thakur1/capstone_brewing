1795,"2015-03-11",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 23, 2015 I said to my lovely girlfriend ""Ummmm...my god....come be a part of this beer"". She came in, sniffed curiously, took a sip and after a few deliciously girly coos and cahs said ""I think that is my favourite beer I have ever had"". And that folks, is the way she goes. I could go on about how it looks but Id rather make it clear that I now feel like a dumb-dumb for having only got two bottles, one for now and one to cellar. The flavour is so damned wonderful that I dont even feel like writing about all of the nuance about it. If you like fine, strong, scrumptious, roasty, dark beers and you are financially solvent and have access to an area that hovers around 10 degrees Celsius, do yourself a solid. Buy a case or two. 


Cellard Rating 12/23/2015- About nine months later. Still just as fine as I remembered it was, maybe even better. There is only the slightest tinge of alcohol in this heavyweight. Its remarkably smooth and dangerously drinkable; curiously complex, a licorice, chocolate and rich, smooth espresso dominate the delivery to the senses. I dont believe to much changes, perhaps just a more seamless integration of tastes and a lessening of alcoholic burn. For those curious, this was stored in a root cellar that mostly hovers around 50-55F but sometimes sees 60-65F during Summer.","Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, CANADA","BrewGoblin"

Pours a deep cola brown with a short-lived tan head and no lacing. Nose is dark fruits, cherry, roast malt, chocolate, very slight smoke. Taste is sweet and only slightly slightly bitter, with caramel, coffee, roasted malt, and maybe just a hint of liquorice. Body is sticky and heavy, but not overly so, and is buoyed somewhat by the persistent carbonation that remains despite the low head.

A year in the cellar has not hurt this at all - just the opposite, in fact. The flavours that I felt were muddled before have now blended beautifully. This is deep, dark and rich, sweet without being too much so, with just the right edge and warming on the finish. I think Ill keep my last one in the cellar for another couple years, maybe pick up another couple to do a vertical. I was far too harsh on it with my last rating - or, alternatively, its improved loads - but either way, Im re-rating it significantly higher.","CANADA","UXO"

1795,"2012-10-24",3.7,"A solid pour into my Bruery tulip produces a dense, three-finger thick, nicely browned, dark tan colored head; it leaves some nice layered lacing on the sides of my glass. The beer is a dark, black color that shows an opaque black hue that shows a hint of a deep red glow when held up directly to the light. The beer smells quite smoky, followed by a warming, spicy alcohol note, a rounded roasted character, some dark chocolate character, a touch of chalky roast character, and even a burnt, smoky fruit character that almost leans towards cherry.

Lightly sweet up front, the beer has a lightness to it up  front, but quickly gets more chewy and rich through to the finish. The smokiness is quite a bit reduced in the flavor compared to it being the dominant note in the nose. Instead rich, dark chocolate, smooth roasted malt, molasses sweetened coffee, and roasted caramel notes are balanced by a soft smokiness that adds a savory roundness to the flavor. The carbonation is fairly light, but still provides a prickly texture to the finish. The sweetness accentuates a roasted, smoky cherry flavor in this beer. As the beer warms up it gets a touch more sweet. The smokiness has a touch of a sharp edge to it; a hint of burnt plastic, and a slight harshness that is characteristic of Briess Cherrywood smoked malt, though it is low enough that it doesnt ruin the beer.

Tasty and lighter bodied than I would have expected in a beer of this strength. This is the first use of cherrywood smoked malt that wasnt so harsh that it didnt just ruin the beer; I would still prefer a different type of woodsmoked malt, but this one was done well and is quite nice in the end.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

1795,"2012-06-04",3.7,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip.

My pour is a robust mahogany brown color with a walnut edge.  A slight ruby tint is visible in the thin parts of the glass as well.  A medium sized tan head forms initially and fades to a ring over time.

The aroma has a full, smooth roasted malt presence.  Some creamy chocolate, dark cherries, a bit of oak, and vanilla all round out the aroma.

The flavor is quite sweet.  There is a smooth, medium roasted malt with a sweet, dark chocolate presence.  There is a little bit of molasses and vanilla, with a building cherry oak presence and a bit of unspecified dark orchard fruit.  The finish stays sweet, with a touch of smoke, and smooth.

Porter Baltique is smooth, rich, creamy, and definitely masks its 10% ABV very well.  It is unfortunatley sticky and a little too far on the sweet side.  The carbonation is a little lighter than medium and has a creamy nature.  On the other hand, the body is definitely on the full side.

Notes of cherries are very well-hidden as well. Quite happy I have held on to this one, but will have to try a more up-to-date version to see if it is as smooth and easy to drink.

The amazing colour seems to suck light in so much that it makes a black hole look opaque. Once you get through the intensity of the colour you notice the head is tanned and laces with the elegance of Chantilly lace while the viscosity means it hangs on the glass like fine aged port. The palate has so much rich chocolate and coffee but that amazing soy cured eel lingers and couples with the smokiness to produce the finest liquid meal I have ever consumed. The length is nearly as dense as the colour and I know this will sit in my throat long after the 12 or so other beers I will consume this evening have come and gone. This is the Dali of beers...

A little bit of alcohol but its in the backbone. Everything in its right place. ""Like bathing in honey.""","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","StompBrockmore"

Mouth feel is medium-thin and very dry with good carbonation. Taste-wise, very sweet with roasted malts and dark fruit up front: blackcurrant, cherries, and  black grapes; very winy.  Underneath lies cherry syrup, black licorice, coffee, burnt toast, dark chocolate, a hint of smoke, and a slight metallic note. Booziness is pleasant, warming and hidden very nicely by the sweetness. Finish is long, dry and nicely bitter. A very delicious dessert brew.","Ontario, CANADA","C2H5OH"

Aroma is very much in line with an Imperial Stout, loads of dark fruity esters and roasted malts. Awesome. Flavour is even better, lots of bitter roast but balanced super well with rich sweet chocolate. Raisins, red grapes, vanilla, caramel, subtle hint of smoke. Velvety smooth as well, very little hint of the alcohol. Reminds me of a milk stout, theres almost a lactic sweetness here that I really enjoy. Minor dryness in the finish from the yeast.

This has been sitting around for a while since Ughsmash sent me the bottle in a trade. I decided to bring it to share with a few others. It was good enough I might have enjoyed the whole thing alone but why be greedy? Drinking this makes me want to make a trip to the source and try more of their releases.

Aroma / Appearance - Medium chocolate in appearance this had a nice balance to it. Fluid and black it released a combination of ash, smoke, light chocolate, and a sweet smooth base.

Flavor / Palate - Cinnamon, spice, and ash were rounded off by a smoky sweetness. The mouthfeel was simultaneously thick and fluid. The alcohol on this one is masked well and does not really show up until near the final sips. Overall this is a perfect baltic porter and reminds me why I like the style so much.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

How: Bottle 750ml (one bottle on first week of release and another bottle 2 months old)
The look: Black body with a short-lived tan head
In long: When first released the brew felt very roasted and syrupy.  A few months later the roastiness level is medium and the beer has dried out a lot.  Powdery and dry cacao sensation.  Burnt toasts with Nutella.  Light fruity notes of prunes and blackberries.  Body is round and smooth despite the overall dryness.  Notes of charcoal.  Mouth drying finish.  Lively carbonation.  No alcohol presence at all.  Very good brew although not quite the sweet/syrupy taste Ive come to expect from Baltic Porters.  Quite original in fact.  The one-batch Signature brews from Trois Mousquetaires truly are excellent but when drinking them Im also sad to think that they might not be brewed again.

Nose of cooling tar, used coffee grounds, a little gassy-ness, and some herbal hops.  Flavors of char, chocolate covered coffee beans, a touch of vanilla, and a raisin finish.  Pretty thin.

1795,"2008-01-11",4.0,"750 mL bottle as ""Bistro LAutre Oeil BP"" from Jovi, served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass.
App.:  Deep, dark brown-black with a moderate light mocha head.
  
Aroma:  An interesting blend of fruit (grapes, berries and cherries), chocolate, black coffee, alcohol, wood, and light funk; a bit of vanilla and caramel, a little smoke; it changes a bit with each sniff.
  
Palate:  Thick, slick body and soft carbonation.
  
Flav.:  Fruits, wood and alcohol, very little coffee or chocolate initially, a vegetal note, nutty; an interesting contrast to the nose; just a hint of tang, some sweetness, a touch of bitterness; a bit of warming alcohol lingers with a nutty finish.

Interesting, enigmatic and complex.  The alcohol is hidden well, perhaps too well.  This could be dangerous.","Nepean, Ontario, CANADA","probstblueribbon"
1795,"2008-01-11",4.0,"750ml caged and corked bottle and brought to our little tasting by Tom, much thanks! Nearly opaque with a long lasting beige head and okay lacing. he aroma has notes of plum, prune, pipe tobacco, aromatic and grassy hops, walnut, mineral water, star anise and yes WINTERGREEN (dont ask me how). I wonderful phenolic nose leads me towards the first taste. Starts malty and fruity as expected with a nice sharp bitterness in support. Hints of bakers chocolate and walnut before rambling off to the lightly spiced and earthy finish. The mouth feel is sharp and aggressive with a warming finish, nice clean dry finish. I dug this more than Tom it seems, even if it is more aggressive than normally found for the genre. MIKEY LIKEY, try some you.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

1795,"2007-12-19",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Sensuous dark chocolate harbors a few dried blackberries, a regal entity morphing into roasting molasses in the last half of each sip. This is a Baltic Porter of the utmost wealth and elegance.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy sheet of foam slowly dissolves into a ring atop the jet black.
-The fruitiness is always contained within the chocolate and molasses sweetness, yet still develops notes of prunes, dates and raisins.
-Amazingly enough, there is no alcohol presence in the flavor profile.
-The flavors are seamlessly integrated into one another; this is cohesion at its best.
-Carbonation is beautifully pillowy, but Ive heard the bottled versions are livelier. Ive yet to sample it from the bottle, so a re-rate will come shortly.
-The closest relative to this Baltic Porter I can find is Thomas Hookers Imperial Porter. Both sumptuous homages to the malt.
-This has been a superb year for Trois Mousquetaires on the craft beer front. Heres to many more!

1795,"2007-12-12",3.4,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a medium size foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of light black chocolate with some sweetness coming through. Taste is a mix between some black chocolate malt with a seriously dry ending. Full body with medium carbonation and no alcohol was apparent with some vinous notes without being cloying. I am not exactly sure what to make of this beer  different and not totally on style but still interesting nonetheless.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
1795,"2007-12-12",3.6,"Almost black, clear around the edges beer with a healthy tan head. A very strong, considerably attenuated dark beer which has a fair bit in common with their Porthos (doppelbock). Switch the toastiness to roastiness, add a pinch of alcohol and youre quite there - the general relation between doppelbocks and baltic porter. By using the same yeast strain, we get similar alcohol connotations, although there may be a further vinous feel here. Were dealing with both blackberry-like fruitiness and a couple of dark grapes. Not quite juicy though as the lager yeast has done a remarkable attenuating job. The carbonation is therefore quite lively for a beer of this type and the associated alcohol feels warming, but never serves as a focus point flavour-wise. Obviously, a fair bit of roastiness is constantly present. I cant really box it into a coffee reminding or chocolate reminding mold, more like plain borderline burnt toast. Thankfully, the fruit notes are devoid of inherent acidity, thus avoiding any clash or astringency. Obviously spot on what they were aiming at. Solid all around. Light-medium body has obviously lost a fair bit of thickness through the yeasts enthusiasm. Seriously, this is much drier than Id have expected. Certainly not a typical vinous, slightly tart, fruity and rather sweet baltic porter with bold contrasting chocolate notes. More of a roasty doppelbock whose yeast went beyond the call of duty. Now to determine if I like it more than the Porthos... Im afraid I might be alone in that camp, but I think not. Both are really worth trying, but afterwards, between the very good one, quite available, at a retail price 4.99$ and the very good one, very rare indeed, at 7.99$, Ill stick with the Porthos.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
