Rather sweet and malty taste of caramel, vanilla, tobacco, bourbon, raisins and some oak, followed by a medium long, slightly bitter, a little warming finish. Above medium-bodied, slightly creamy mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Really good and very complex for that abv, reveals lovely barrel notes without them being too dominant and offers a full enough body to support them.

1412,"2016-01-31",4.2,"Bottle shared with Rian and Mark. Many thanks to Gabriel (erzengel) for bringing this over for us last month. Copper with a lively off white head. I was little sceptical and expecting something gimmicky here, but this is a superb beer. All the classy long lagered smoothness of an Altbier, the extra body of a Sticke and superbly executed barrel ageing, with just the right Burbon notes along with subtle wood. Despite the age, the spicy hops still shine through. The best new wave German beer Ive tried to date.","Harrow, Greater London, ENGLAND","bobinlondon"

1412,"2015-12-27",3.9,"Pours a dark brown color, revealing a darker red, ember glow, while held against the light. Has a decent head, collapsing to a crown of bubbly lacing, coating the whole surface of the glass.

Bourbon is the first thing I get, as for the aromas, while it is well entangled into bready malts. This leads to caramel, dried fig, molasses, resulting from its warm, oakie profile, topped off by a vanilla note. Apart from its typical, spicy caramel quality this almost reminds me of a barrel aged barleywine.

Has a medium, well fitting carbonation, unusual low for an Alt to highlight the beers bigger body in this, while not completely abandoning its refreshment. Especially on the mid-palate, a lively, but soft carbonation helps to prevent the malts from becoming overly heavy and sweet, complimenting stony, dry earth.

Tastes of caramel dipped oak chips, which get easily handled by whole grain bread during the beginning. As the flavors evolve, the Bourbon channels more flavors onto the palate, dried fruits, a note of pepper and wild honey, soothed by the warming barrel, which blends amazingly well into the malt foundation of the beer. Spices become even more apparent during the swallow, while resulting in an utmost clean, Alt typical finish, in which the malts prevail, while wooden spices still cut through, together with a glazed caramel note.

This is great, I like the idea of creating a barrel aged Barleywine-like Imperial Alt, decadent and sweet, while remembering its origin and sticking to its style. The distinguishing Füchschen spiced sweetness is certainly the perfect enabler for getting the most out of the Bourbon barrel, while soothing its warmth with a potent bread maltiness. The barrel addition has certainly a huge impact on the beers taste, while its mouthfeel remains as smooth and velvet as usual for an Alt, cushioning its spiced heat.","GERMANY","aleigator"
