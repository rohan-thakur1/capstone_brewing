2885,"2017-05-09",4.0,"On tap @ Copenhagen Beer Celebration 2016. This one has a golden colored light blurry body with a small sidesticking whiteish head. Smells really nice with, vinegar sour -white currants mainly. Theres also sour apricots and a little woody gastric apply acid. Super sour, sharp vinegar and wood in the taste. Sour strawberries and sour peaches. Wow! Mid oily in the mouth and about average on the carbonation. Prickling. Really flavorful though, but perhaps a tad too acidic vinegar dominated for my delicate palate. Nah, its a delicious one. 14.05.2016","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Aroma of rather jammy strawberry, citrus peel and acidity, lightly grainy malt, fairly substantial earthy barnyard, some oak, a bit yeasty, lightly sweet despite the tartness. Flavour is quite strawberry forward, fresh fruit and a touch of sweet preserves, some yeast layers and dusty funk, citrus tartness, oak, dry acidic finish. Medium bodied, effervescent carb. Doesnt have the complexity of Cask 200 but it is nice and refreshing. Strawberries are tough to work with and this does them well.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

Hazy gold-copper pour, large bubbled fizzy white head dies quick, leaves a small white mountain. Unripe sour strawberry is largely seedy, lactic softness rounding it out, bits of biscuit and a faintly vegetal chive note. Pillowy soft front palate, just the right dough and sugar to balance the sweeter strawberry (than nose), light citric and lactic mid, the palates ultra-fine carbonation announces the strawberry, less seed than the nose, more sweetness and balance. Heavy co2 bitterness in the long, lightly watery/flabby finish, creamy dough returning, light vanilla sugar cookie accents at the end with sweet strawberry forever. Awesome control and body, the strawberry is pronounced but doesnt dominate, moderate acid ensuring that its saison, competing slightly in finish with strawberry, high bitterness and carbonation yielding champagne comparisons.

2885,"2014-07-30",3.9,"Bottle... Murky yellow pour with a small, creamy, white head. Good retention. No real strawberry component detected in the nose, but plenty of breadiness and acidity. Medium to full-bodied with spritzy carbonation. The flavor is sour and fruity, and provides the strawberry component that is lacking in the aroma. Crisp, bready, tart finish. I wish the bouquet was as fruity and offered as much strawberry goodness as the flavor. Bottle courtesy of landhoney!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2885,"2014-07-13",4.2,"Bottle shared by Barry at Ryans. Poured peach color with beautiful head and lacing. They really make a nice looking beer over there at Sante. Smell is citrus, strawberry, brett, and oak. Flavor is most of the same but I have to say that I wish the strawberries were more noticeable in the flavor. This saison is unbelievable but not strawberry forward in taste, more lemon, sprees, yeast and dank wood. Medium body/mouth. Another winner from Sante.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
2885,"2014-07-12",4.0,"Bottle at Ryans. Pours a deep murky orange with light white lacing. Aroma is strawberry and funk. Mouthfeel is medium plus and creamy with notes of strawberry, funky wheat, oak and additional fruit.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
2885,"2014-07-03",3.8,"Bottle shared by Seth. Cloudy yellow pour with a white. Mild berry bouquet. Tart with brett and yeasty notes. Very mild nectarine (more so than strawberry). Stone fruits? Average body and mouthfeel.","Florida, USA","50belair"
2885,"2014-06-29",4.0,"Bottle: Thanks, Tony. Peach colored with a very faint pink tint, opaque with a foamy, white film & collar on top. Aroma of musty hay & straw-like barnyard-y funk, lemon & lacto tang, apparent tartness, & a good dose of strawberry Pez candy notes. Quite sour! Wow, nice lactic sourness up front with some stone fruit & strawberry candy adding a touch of sweetness, but also a vivid acidity. Mild, musty cotton & hay-funk that mellows things out before fading away & leaving a lemon-y sourness in the finish. Dry, lightly acidic aftertaste. Delicious!","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
2885,"2014-05-26",4.5,"Got a taste of this on tap at the Sante 2-year anniversary party, which inspired me to drink my bottle because jesus christ what a beer. Pours a tangerine color with a rosy blush and a pinkish white head. The aroma is a heavenly blend of sweet tarts/orange pixie stix, kefir, full-fat strawberry yogurt, slight saltwater, and key lime pie. Just outrageous. Flavor is no letdown, in fact it pumps up the perfumey strawberry and adds honey yogurt, cranberry, light cedar, funky sourness with a whisper of sulfur, again sweet tarts, bleu cheese. So much here. Best strawberry beer around. Soft and luscious. Wow.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

2885,"2014-05-13",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 16, 2014 750ml Bottle (16e), Batch 1, poured into a snifter glass  huge thanks to Jose and Audrey for grabbing me a bottle. Aroma is fairly fruity with obvious strawberry sweetness, light peach, light citrus and even some vanilla. There is a pleasant whiff of acidity with some white wine and oak. The beer pours cloudy pale orange/light pink with nice thick head that quickly settles to a film over the liquid. The flavor is thirst quenching with juicy strawberry, light pineapple citrus, light vanilla that makes the beer drink like a strawberry smoothie. Excellent balanced sweetness and acidity with the oak coming into play towards the back end. The body is medium, juicy, with medium-soft carbonation and a semi-dry sour finish. After taste is seedy fruit, white wine grape, acid, with low tannin. Overall an awesome variation of an already almost perfect barrel aged saison.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
2885,"2014-04-11",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2014 From a bottle at the brewery. Aroma has a slight acidity to it with medium phenolic notes, a medium light citrus character and light grassiness. Phenolics are clove and white peppercorn. Moderate fruit esters, mostly citrus but also some overripe stone fruit. Light strawberry that becomes a bit more prevalent as it warms. The strawberry is definitely more of a complimentary aroma than primary characteristic. Pours a slightly cloudy pale gold with faint hints of pink; cloudier and pinker as you get towards the bottom of the bottle. Medium thick, moderately sized, slightly off white head that exhibits pretty good retention. Light lacing and small legs. Flavor is similar to the aroma with a light acidity and hints of oak tannins. Medium light phenolics with a pepper and coriander note along with some grains of paradise. Light bitterness. Moderate fruit character balanced between citrus, pineapple and stone fruit. Medium light strawberry notes that once again do not overwhelm the base beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Overall a very nice twist on the Cask 200 beer. The strawberries play a background role which seems to prevent the typical plastic phenolic note that a lot of strawberry beers can develop while still providing some complexity and fruit character.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
