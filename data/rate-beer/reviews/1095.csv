1095,"2012-04-16",3.0,"UPDATED: JUN 30, 2014 [16/4/2012, cask at the William Robert Loosley (JDW), High Wycombe] Cloudy pale gold. Creamy, dry, light pear flavour.  In fact, like a dry pear milkshake.  There?s a spicy kick at the back of the throat.  It?s a strange perry, but I rather liked it by the end. 5/3/7/4/13.

Re-rate, 22/6/2014, on tap at Tweedies Bar,  Grasmere.  Clear gold. Flat,  smooth,  creamy, almost cloying mouthfeel- felt it needed a bit more life to it. Flavour is more apples than pears,  with some vanilla- if I hadnt have known it was a perry I might have thought it was a sweet cider. The sweetness is eased by the light body. Definitely one for the mass-market, its easy-drinking and inoffensive. 5/3/5/3/11.
