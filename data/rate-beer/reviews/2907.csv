2907,"2016-08-24",4.1,"Hmm, pretty good stuff. Aroma is apples, spices, and a bit of funk. Flavors like nose, plus some tart and a little oak.

2907,"2016-07-30",4.2,"bottle. Golden yellow with one finger head. Its crazy what a different there are between the caged and corked AO ciders to the standard AO offerings. An explosion of sweet apple flavor. Mild subtle oak and spice. Not super complex, but I cant imagine who wouldnt enjoy the heck out of this.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"
2907,"2016-07-04",4.5,"Really beautiful and complex cider with oaky vanilla notes, cinnamon, and a nice apple character with just a hint of sweetness. Very good stuff and if it were from a more crafty cidery it would get a ton of love imo.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"

2907,"2016-02-01",3.5,"Bottle was brought by a friend a co worker... Aroma was apple damp wood and some all spice. Color rich golden yellow with a brilliant clarity.

2907,"2015-12-28",3.7,"750 mL bottle poured. I have been eyeing this bottle for years now, but always hesitated at the $20 price tag. Found it for $12 though, so that was easily enough persuasion. Clear golden pour with a quick fade head. More or less standard apple cider aroma. Flavor is on the juicy side. Very apple juice like, drinks nice. Not too sweet. Not a whole lot that separates this from the standards. Expected more I guess, but very tasty overall.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
2907,"2015-12-10",4.2,"Good for what it is. Very good desert cider. Sweet as expected and very drinkable. Generally, very sweet would limit me to a glass but that does not happen with this.","Nashua, New Hampshire, USA","Mr_Weasel"
2907,"2015-11-13",3.3,"Has to be a 2014 bottle, Ive had it for over a year. Pours a clear deep golden with quite a bit of fizzy eggshell foam that evaporates, leaving a sparkling body. Nose involves candy apple, damp wood, light clove spice, some herbal honey tea like aromas, toasty toffee. Really sweet, fairly tart. Medium toward heavier bodied for a cider, thick yet actively carbed, finishing candy sweet and tart. Quite nicely done, but gets overbearing. Maybe more oak and less sweet would be more to my liking, but this is a nice dessert cider.","North Central, Indiana, USA","574deadzone"
2907,"2015-10-24",3.6,"Pour out of 750 mL bottle, clear orange pour with white head, aroma brought notes of apple juice, spice, oak, some vanilla into a bit of champagne notes, hints of tart lemon.

Dry sweet apple skin nose, sharp esters, and co2. Creamy medium body with lively carb. Mid palate tells you this is real cider, with some dryness and complexity. Nice balance of fruit, skin, yeast, and carbonic bite. Finish is just north enough of dry to keep you charging through the bottle.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2907,"2015-09-09",3.7,"750 mL bottle from Amity Liquors, New Haven. Clear golden, large fizzy head that quickly fades, but lots of visible carbonation.

Medium bodied, soft, spritzy carbonation, lingering sweetness. While quite sweet, not cloying, and decent balance.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
2907,"2015-09-09",2.6,"Bottle, shared with friends. Medium golden, brisk carbonation of medium-sized bubbles. Sweet apple aroma and flavour, mild spice. Too sugary sweet for my preference, and for whatever reason I found this to have a ""fake apple"" character, like candy almost.

2907,"2015-08-05",4.0,"Bright clear golden color with a fizzy head that disappears quickly, but continues to produce streams of tiny bubbles like a golden champagne. The aroma is tart green apple with hints of spice and vanilla. The taste starts sweet but then goes tart and acidic, very nice apple with undertones of cinnamon, vanilla and maybe allspice. Finishes dry and tangy, Slightly funky. Light/medium bodied, smooth and quite easy to drink. Overall a very enjoyable cider.","Independence, Missouri, USA","whynot44"
2907,"2015-07-22",4.0,"Visual: Pours clear deep golden yellow with a small head, continually re-emerging fizzy head, the most activity Ive ever seen in a cider. A wonderous sight.

Nose: lightly acidic, sweet & sour red apple juice. (lvl-9)-pungency

Attack: concentrated sugars and flavours

Mid-palate: juicy-tingly light fizzy mouthfeel, clean (lvl-5)-sweetness sugars, medium dissipating sour-tangy, (MAIN) apple wine, baked red & green apple, yeasty, 

Finish: alcohol hit, lingering sour acidity, thickened saliva, fruity finish.

Summary: It packs the density and body of an icewine yet offers a refreshing effervescent texture and mouthfeel. Extremely sippable and approachable. One of the best quality cider Ive had to date. The last good one I had was Temptation Frizzante - The View back in Oct, 2012.","","sulawang"

2907,"2014-11-21",3.5,"750 ml bottle from Total Wine.

After seeing the ratings on here I was really eager to try this one. It pours a rich clear gold. The nose is musty apples, quite rich. Nice. Flavor is intense and relatively sweet but with a tart bite behind the sugars. I dont get as much from the oak as some seem to. Sticky mouthfeel, as a previous rater notes. Certainly very enjoyable, though somewhat on the sparkling apple juice side of matters.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2907,"2014-11-20",4.2,"750 ml bottle. Pours a deep gold color with moderate white head that settles slowly. Intense aromas of old golden apples.

2907,"2014-08-29",3.4,"8/29/14. 750mL bottle from Five Points. Dark golden pour with a huge fizzy khaki head that sizzles away instantly. It does remind of champagne, actually, as the bottle says. We are actually enjoying this out of a champagne flute for funzies. Sweet apple juice aroma, brown sugar, and not much else. Rather sweet flavor, not what I was expecting for an almost 8% cider that mentions champagne on the bottle. Sweet apples, like apple juice, but it very lightly reminds me of a green Jolly Rancher in a way... Mild hint of a bitter yeastiness. Not bad.","Georgia, USA","drowland"

2907,"2014-07-06",3.9,"Bottle. Pours a vivid gold with a light, quick-dissipating white head and copious amounts of visible carbonation. Nose is vanilla, apple, toast, and lactic and savory notes. Definitely demi-sec, though turning more bitter on the finish; theres a drying wood and apple-peel note on the back of the mouth that keeps it from being cloying that really cleans it up. The oak adds nutmeg and more vanilla. Finish has honey, floral, and peel notes. Very well done.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"

Taste: Very dry at first. Crisp, juicy, and gentle kiss of oak.

Palate: Sticky. Light bodied, moderate length on the finish, ends on light sweetness.

Overall: Very much like a sparkling wine indeed. Not as sweet as a moscato, and not as dry as a brut champagne. Quite delicious.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","wildbeercat"

2907,"2014-03-18",3.9,"750 ml. Clear and shiny golden amber with a highly active body that maintains a creamy covering of foam. Aroma is slightly tart apple with touches of earthy spice, caramel and white wine. Taste is sweeter but still shows a pleasant tartness from the apple. Also less of the spiciness in the flavor and at first I struggled to find any oak. After 6 oz or so, the long finish has a nice drying quality that has some oak, but leaves a taste nearer to a mild apple-flavored tobacco. Light body is to the sweet side and plenty fizzy and astringent as intended, but I could do with a little less carbonation. Still this is a very tasty cider thats balanced enough to be an easy drinker. I believe AO has found a nice middle way with this 7.7% abv cider thats definitely better than their others Ive tried that were either 5 or 10%.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
