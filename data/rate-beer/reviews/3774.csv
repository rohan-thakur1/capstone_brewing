3774,"2017-02-11",3.8,"Bottle from Maruho. Pours a murky bronze-gold, pillowy creamy head, lacing. Banana and wheat off the top, caramel, nicely toasted malt. Flavour reveals caramel sweetness, lingering clove, good balance of its parts. Further down the glass a spirit note crept in a tad. Smooth feel, full and mouth coating. Very well done, having recently had Aventinus this is a top quality weizen bock.","Osaka, JAPAN","mrjez"
3774,"2017-01-10",3.1,"Draft - Banana and caramel. Cloudy copper with a decent white head. Caramel sweet and banana. Banana fosters which is hitting the nail on the head.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
3774,"2016-10-26",3.6,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2016 Glowing amber color with frothy white head. Big nose of apple, cinnamon and spice. A great christmas smelling beer, even though I had it in October. Rich full bodied, but perhaps a bit too clovey and estery for my liking. The apple cinnamon lingers in the finish. Good, but on the verge of cloying.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
3774,"2015-09-26",3.7,"Keyaki Fall 2015. Cloudy deep gold almost like mango juice with a nice big soapy head. Clove, cinnamon, banana cream pie and some apple on the nose. Rich and creamy mouthfeel. Fairly sweet with a nice spice-laden finish. Very enjoyable.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"

3774,"2014-03-23",3.5,"Mild apricot aroma. Nice fruity malt flavor, creamy peach, then usual banana cake, hints of alcohol, peppery finish. Another well crafted and rounded Fujizakura brew, on par with some German legends.","","biirusaikou"
3774,"2013-12-15",4.2,"7% on tap at Bungalow. 600 yen. Sold Out! Another keg arrived while we were there, saved again! This is a souped up version of their great weizen with a bigger bolder biscuity malt profile for winter. A lovely cloudy honey gold. Spicy, cinnamon, biscuity, zesty full bodied. An incredibly tasty beer where you dont get the alcohol at all. This beer will not disappoint - fantastic stuff.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
3774,"2013-12-13",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 30, 2014 Bottle from Yamaoka. Pours a dark cloudy orange. Aroma of sweet banana and wheat. Fantastic creamy, banana taste. Great lasting flavour, one of the best weizen bocks I?ve had.","Kyoto, JAPAN","GenkiGonzo"
3774,"2013-12-11",4.0,"Tap at iBrew. Poor quality, last beer of the night rating for a delicious beer Amber orange cloudy, aroma is bananas, wheat, creamy. Taste is good, lightly spicy, creamy, ice cream. Great stuff.","Tokyo, JAPAN","shoulderbroken"
3774,"2012-01-16",4.2,"the mouthfeel is tremendous;30 minutes after finishing the beer my tongue kept rubbing against my upper gums trying to squeeze any last remnants of the weizen.
the beer is 6.7 avb,but drinks like a 5.3.the only thing i would think about changing is making it just a little,little less sweet.","JAPAN","left_bank"
3774,"2009-01-03",3.4,"Bottle from Tanakaya. Rich smooth pour revealed a hearty nose of overripe banana, apricots, wheat, plum. Mouthfeel was creamy and hazed out with sweet carbonation tickling the sides of my tongue. Slightly syrupy finish on the lips and a slight boozy warmth rising in the chest and throat towards the end of this worthy brew.","JAPAN","buzzoven"
3774,"2008-12-22",3.5,"2008 bottle from Yamaoka. Hazy dark amber color. Strong banana aroma with some spicy notes, especially cloves. Very smooth malty flavor Suprisingly quaffable, not as rich or sweet as I expected.","JAPAN","kabutomushi"
3774,"2008-12-17",3.8,"This souped up Weizen really hits the spot. More of everything, especially the banana. The only problem may be the sweetness, but I enjoyed that","JAPAN","jonno"
3774,"2008-09-10",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2013 2013 Version. Tap at iBrew. Super rich and malty, cake-lik. Wonderfully luscious and rich. This is really a world-class weizenbock, possibly better than Aventinus now. Huge cloves, nice banana, light caramel and fudge.

2007 version, bottle from Yamaoka: 8/3/8/4/15. 
Deep orange-amber to medium brown color. Super tall, extra fine head. Cloudy. Fragrant weizen aroma, bananas, cloves, a touch sour but mainly sweet. Quite sweet banana and wheat malt flavor. Huge bananas, some spice, chocolate. Tastes weaker than 7%. The round mellow flavor and rich malt grew on me. Very easy to drink and rich, dessert-like, though a touch too sweet with not enough to balance that.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
