3456,"2017-04-17",3.4,"330 ml bottle bought at IC Beer in Kwun Tong.
Looks: Opaque deep Cola blackish brown colour with a thin crust of yeast sediments; Less than one-quarter finger head with residual soapy beige foam which fades in 15 seconds; Poor sticky lacing with zero carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and sweet dark malt, with strong roastyness, hazelnuts, strong cream, strong coffee liquor, strong liquorices, strong caramel, sticky toffee, plums, floral, sugar, spices, toast and grass.

Taste: Strong sweet dark malt, with strong roastyness, strong black coffee, chocolate, strong alcohol and liquorices, strong caramel and sticky toffee, red fruits, strong cream, floral, syrup, spices, strong herbs, light biscuits, lemon, strong bitter hops and sharp grass. 

Body: Medium body; Oily palate.

Mouth Feel: Strong dark maltyness in a pretty viscous background. Roasty with very clear sharp black coffee, followed by strong cream and heavy sugary sweetness. Strong booze with very strong caramel, toffee and chocolate, with quite abundant red fruits and floral. Very strong herbs with dry bread and lemon to round. Very intense but off-balanced!

Alcohol: the 10.9% abv is naked, screams loudly with lots of liquorices bitterness to go with the syrups. Not exactly cloying but it deters me from getting a full mouthful. Seems to be at odds with the hops and dark malt. Strong but not tasty. 

Hoppiness: floral, spices, and grass in nose. Floral, spices, strong herbs, lemon and sharp grass in taste; Bitterness - hops and liquorices - is strong for a lasting, high astringent sweet-bitter malty finish.

After taste: Fairly dry. Sweet, boozy and bitter to mouth.

Comments: This one has a very strong creaminess - perhaps an attribute from civet coffee - which should have make it a pleasant tasting experience, but it was heavily affected by screaming booze and heavy sweetness, in the absence of any strong burnt toast or distinguish dark maltyness. Hoppiness is quite decent but couldnt turn the sweet boozy tide. Not a train wreck but unbalanced. Too strong but going nowhere. I understand that most of its high scores happened when it was contract-brewed by Nøgne Ø, but mine was brewed by Levrig, so I wonder if thats the difference in opinion. Anyhow, better stick with Beer Geek Breakfast instead.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

No artificial flavor here, which is nice. Taste is semi-sweet in the beginning, but from the middle it becomes bitter and intensifies in the end.

Full body, creamy texture (some describe the as oily and thick, which is definitely not true), in the beginning lively carbonation, but later on rather soft, finish is semi-bitter, coffee, smooth and silk. Very nice palate Id say velvety. In general very balanced beer with perfectly combination of coffee, roasted malts and perfectly timing of all flavors.

3456,"2016-07-21",4.3,"Jest to Imperialny Stout owsiany warzony z dodatkiem wietnamskiej, najdroższej na świecie kawy Kopi Luwak. 
 Dodatki:  Płatki owsiane, kawa wietnamska Ca Phe Chon (Kopi Luvak) 
 Data ważności:  13.05.2026 
 Kolor:  Czarny jak bezgwiezdna noc w Stavanger. Kompletnie nieprzejrzysty. 
 Piana:  Co tutaj się dzieje? Piana dosłownie znika w oczach. Dawno nie widziałem tak szybko pękających bąbelków.
Jest ciemnobeżowa, lekka, niska, drobna. I tyle zdążyłem zapisać zanim spojrzałem ponowenie na firmowego Rastala Mikkellera.
Nie ma żadnych śladów jej obecności, ani milimetra pierścienia. 
 Zapach:  Piękny, po prostu piękny. Aromat jest wielowarstwowy i z każdym kolejnym niuchem wyłapać można coś nowego.
Początek wyraźnie słodki, czekolada deserowa, karmel, bardzo intensywna wanilia. Zaraz za nim odrobina brązowego cukru trzcinowego i lukrecji.
Kawa nie jest w zapachu aż nadto intensywna, nie miażdży kubków zapachowych tak jak można by było się tego spodziewać. 
 Smak:  Po pierwszych łykach odpływam powoli do wietnamskiego raju. Raj ten jest pełen ziaren kawy, gorzkiej i deserowej czekolady. Po języku spływają słodkie nuty wanilii, lukrecji i karmelu. Po lekkim ogrzaniu, podniebienie łechtają ciemne owoce. Na finiszu jest już sos sojowy i ponownie wytrawne, mocne Double Espresso. Paloność jest na umiarkowanym poziomie. RIS jest cudownie lepki, gęsty, jedwabiście otula język swoją delikatną powłoką. Ciepło alkoholowe rozgrzewa od środka. 
Doskony balans poszczególnych elementów. Tworzą one barwną, spójną i niezwykle harmonijną kompozycję.
Pomimo wysokiego woltażu piwo wydaje się bardzo lekkie i nieziemsko pijalne. W tym tkwi jego największy sekret. 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Jest to RIS z dodatkiem płatków owsianych, a także najdroższej i nalepszej kawy na świecie Kopi Luwak.

Kopi luwak jest gatunkiem kawy wytwarzanej z ziaren kawy, które wydobywane są z odchodów zwierzęcia z rodziny łaszowatych zwanego lokalnie luwak.

Łaskun chętnie zjada owoce kawowca, ale nie trawi jego nasion, a jedynie miąższ. Po nadtrawieniu przez enzymy trawienne i lekkim sfermentowaniu przez bakterie produkujące kwas mlekowy ziarna przechodzą przez przewód pokarmowy i są wydalane. Zwierzę zjada tylko najlepsze owoce, a przez przejście przez przewód pokarmowy łaskuna ziarna kawy tracą gorzki smak i kawa z nich wytwarzana zyskuje nowy, łagodny aromat. Po oczyszczeniu kawę przetwarza się w typowy sposób. (Źródło : Wikipedia) 

Brunch Weasel jest rewelacyjnym RIS-em. Uwielbiam Mikkeller & Friends za ich pełne, słodkie, lepkie i niezwykle bogate smakowo RIS-y.
Ilość elementów wyłapanych podczas degustacji jest niezwykle imponująca.
Kawa, jak się obawiałem mogła zdominować profil piwa, jednak ku mojej uciesze tak się nie stało.
Została ona po mistrzowsku wklejona w całość i nie zaburzyła finalnego odbioru.
Faktura piwa i alkoholowe ciepło kapitalnie dopełniają całokształt. 

Na takie piwa warto czekać latami.
To był na prawdę kompletny do A do Z RIS.

Aroma:

Medium/heavy aroma of malts, caramel, vanilla, chocolate, roasted malts, coffee and hops.

Taste/Palate:

Starts heavy sweet with malts, caramel, vanilla and chocolate; ends slightly/medium bitter and dry with roasted malts, coffee and hops.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. All that could be said, is underrating this beer. The malts together with the added sugar, give this the exact same flavour of genuine bakery chocolate.

De aroma's zijn complex en speciaal met tonen van espresso koffie, ik ruik ook een speciale aromatische houtgeur die lijkt op cederhout. Verder ook tonen van pure chocolade, mokka. Het smaakpallet is heel speciaal en verwant aan de aroma's. Zelden zoveel koffie tonen in een bier geproefd, ik heb de ca phe chon koffie nog niet geproefd, alleen nu dus voor de eerste keer in een Imperial Stout. En de smaken zijn heerlijk bitter en naarmate het bier opwarmt steeds zoeter. Het mondgevoel is heel olieachtig, er drijft zelfs een olieachtig laagje op het bier. Smaaktonen van: espresso koffie, pure chocolade, mokka, cederhout en vanille. De carbonatie is heel licht bijna vlak. De afdronk is zeer lang, droog koffie bitter. Het is jammer dat er geen schuimkraag op deze fles Brunch Weasel meer zat, het voorkomt een rating rond de 4,8. Voorlopig vind ik de Cocoa Shake uit de Beer Geek series van Mikkeller nog de beste.

3456,"2014-12-05",4.6,"11.2 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at room temperature.

A: Pours a level of black that should probably emit Hawking radiation, while forming a very thin, very dark brown head that dissipates quickly and leaves no trace at all - no cap, no ring, maybe a couple stray bubbles temporarily along the sides of the glass. In other words, nothing escapes it. Im guessing its somewhat high gravity. (These jokes should all go under one of Mikkellers other beers, but they fit better with the appearance of this one.)

S: The aroma, which somehow manages to escape the event horizon of the beer surface, strikes up front as sweet with dark fruitiness throughout. Both roasted chocolate malt and sweeter notes are present, as one would expect from an oatmeal stout. Fruity notes include plums, figs, and currants. Despite one of the main ingredients, I detect no litterbox odors - perhaps those simply arent shunted away from the singularity during dilation. Oddly enough, I get little to no coffee odor as well.

T: Unexpectedly, this beer did not tear my tongue apart and then crush it into an infinitesimally tiny ball of matter, so thats a plus. Toffee and chocolate malts strike up front, joined shortly by a quick rush of more fruity notes ranging from plum to currant. As the beer moves along the palate, an earthy, burnt bitter flavor swirls in to conceal the rest, which in turn yields to an almost pure coffee taste at the finish. A pleasant roasted coffee aftertaste lingers well after the swallow, markedly less bitter than any other coffee I have tasted aside from pure Kona coffee in Kailua-Kona itself.

M: Smooth and silken, with scarcely any carbonation to be found nor tasted - literally just enough to leave the beer not feeling dead and lifeless in the mouth. Its not the heaviest oatmeal stout Ive ever tasted, which is surprising given the amount of mass it should have, but it compares decently to others in the style.

O: Eminently drinkable, this hides its ABV well behind a wall of shifting flavor complexity. I would consider buying again. One could say it has a powerful attractive force. All right, Ill knock off the lame black hole jokes. Suffice it to say, despite being made with crap, this is far from a crappy beer.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

This imperial Oatmeal stout is brewed with one of the worlds most expensive coffees, made from droppings of weasel-like civet cats. The fussy Southeast Asian animal are picky and will eat nothing but the best and ripest coffee berries. Enzymes in their digestive system aid the process of breaking down the beans which brews a strong, fist-in-the-air flavored coffee.

Rich, driven by big fairly roasty coffee, dark chocolate core, a little sweet, rather earthy, hints of dark, getting slightly bitter towards the finish with loads of coffee, vanilla, bit of that creamy oat character, moderately roasty. Lingering coffee that seems to last on and on, with persistent chocolate as well. Rich, full creamy mouthfeel, thick from the oats, light carb, no alcohol. Superb coffee imperial stout, the ca phe chon really adds something with its pungency and slightly unusual flavour profile.

It is somewhat sweet and definitely warming. Those complex flavours coming together in a symphony... a symphony of... you know the bit where in the Witches of Eastwick where the school orchestra finally gets its act together and performs in perfect unison?

Has fantastic, multi-layered aromas of coffee flavors, creamy sweetness, deep roasted malts and bitter chocolate, accompanied by a burning alcohol layer. Very complex and pleasant, with coffee being the most dominant ingredient.

Toffeeish, earthy malts go along with distinct coffee flavors, which hit the palate in an incredible smooth, creamy fashion. Coffee then turns bitter, overcoming the milk chocolate note more and more. While the brew actually begins sweeter than expected, the sweetness doesnt take over the whole palate, due to the rich coffee infusion. Also the coffee bitterness is very balanced, as a strong earth maltiness holds it at bay. The most surprising aspect is the incredible smoothness in this brew, making this the perfect pairing for e.g. a fruity chocolate cake, providing the creaminess for both, cake and brew. Alcohol is very well integrated in this complex tasting beer, adding to the bitter coffee sting, without being detectable on its own.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3456,"2014-10-13",3.7,"Theres something about beers with ca phe chon coffee that I dont find that pleasant (in addition to the fact that the poor civets that digested the coffee beans probably were force-fed and not treated very nicely). They all seem to have a raw, green and vegetal feel that I dont find in beers based on other types of coffee. The Beer Geek Brunch Weasel has the same thing, both in the very strong aroma and the equally strong flavour. It is also a bit one dimensional, its very coffee dominated hardly without any other elements, except some dark roasted malt and dark caramel. It looks black in the glass, and the tiny, fizzy, brown head disappears completely in no time. The mouthfeel is pleasant, its a full-bodied brew with an oily to creamy texture and soft carbonation. Despite all my complaints: its of course a very good beer, just not at the very top, and I prefer regular coffee beans in my imperial stouts.

Wow. I didnt realize before tasting this, that the titular weasel was the civet cat, and that this is basically made with kopi leuwak. And it shows - theres no bitterness or astringency from the coffee at all. In fact, theres very little bitterness at all, despite the rich coffee flavour. I keep waiting for the bitterness to hit, and it just doesnt. The bitterness is not the only thing thats conspicuously absent here, either: the ABV is utterly and completely missing.

Thin, tanned head, colour straightforwardly black. Complex aroma of indeed coffee beans, although I am not capable of determining whether it be loewak coffee or regular coffee; also vanilla, dates, bayleaf, leather, bitter chocolate, caramel and toasted bread; taste a profound maltiness, bit caramelly, chocolatey, coffee, middle a bit sweeter and fruitier, in the finish the roasted bitterness takes over with loads of coffee, long and dry; mouthfeel grainy yet silky thanks to the oatmeal. Very interesting to finally get the change to taste this exclusivity, but I fail to see a good reason to add such expensive coffee instead of any other one - I guess this would be more of interest to coffee connoisseurs.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

This, though, seems to be one of the brews by which Mikkel can still be counted among the best craft brewers in Europe. It is not only the rich aromas which combine powerful malts and chocolate with earthy coffee and a surprisingly balanced appeal. It is not even the strong, mouth filling yet deeply satisfying taste of chocolate malts, well hidden alcohol warmth and long, long finish of bitters. The real standout for the is the way this beer looks and feels. One of the most luscious beers I have even seen and a velvety smooth palate, softly carbonated, never too sticky though and with a drinkability of something much less complex. Amazing recipe, very well executed too. Yes, sometimes this brewer still hits a home run, I think. (33cl bottle from Saveur Biere)","Leuven, BELGIUM","erickok"

Aroma is an intense yet balanced fresh black coffee with a slight sweet complexity from roasted malts. Notes of bakers chocolate as well - a deliciously bitter aroma. Flavor is full and overpowering. Coffee is dominant, with notes of sweet chocolate, caramel, malt, oats. Mouthfeel is full, rich and viscous, like a simple syrup. The finish is outstanding - no change from the bold flavor. If anything is different, there is a slight hint of mild peppermint that Im tasting - a pleasant roasty bitter chocolaty finish overall that is just superb.

 -- 
Appearance: 5/5. Pours a gorgeous thick chocolate brown-black with a very dark brown foamy head that lingers. I salivated watching it pour. 
 -- 
Aroma: 7/10. Intensely yeasty and with a strong hoppy-pine aroma. Subtler notes of cocoa. Definite notes of alcohol. A little sour in the smell.
 -- 
Taste: 9/10. A nice, surprisingly restrained coffee-cocoa-ness to it with piney but not particularly bitter hoppiness. Chocolate to start, coffee along the way, and then a strong coffee-hops bitterness at the back.
 -- 
Palate: 4/5. *Incredibly* smooth across the lips and tongue, theres no mistaking this at all for an imperial oatmeal stout right from the mouthfeel alone. Smooth and creamy across the tongue and all the way back. Only very light carbonation, with one of the gentlest astringencies Ive come across in any oatmeal stout. The bitterness is a little too much in the finish though, and thats the only fault in the beer, really.
 -- 
Overall: 17/20. Outstanding, but the bitterness in the finish is a critical flaw. While not as sweet as I like my stouts, the mouthfeel is surely the best Ive ever had on any beer. Everything in this beer (except that finish bitterness) is in perfect balance. Restrained, pleasant, and delivering on its promises.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","Bahumat"

Taste - 8/10 - again, coffee, oatmeal, roasted malts, chocolate, plus maybe a tiny bit of burnt flavors, even burnt rubber
Palate - 4/5 - its pretty creamy and chocolate milkshake like, but Im finding with coffee stouts that the coffee decreases the complexity a lot of the time because its overpowering. Thick mouthfeel tho, alc covered, aftertaste = coffee.

Taste: very nice, up front getting the roasted malts, coffee, caramel malt, dark fruits. The dark fruits aren't as forward as I would have expected given how noticeable they were on the nose, they are more in the background on the palate. The alcohol is nearly undetectable, which is very impressive, though I do get the warmth of it after the swallow.

A: Pours a dark, nearly black ale with little head formation. Medium sheet of light mocha, fine bubble sheet on surface. Spider web lacing. 

S: Plenty of coffee as anticipated. The beer offers up a high astringency in the coffee, but then subsequently opens up to reveal the malts and tones I typically die for. Amazingly subdued by the coffee. As it warms, the beer becomes more open and enjoyable.

T: The coffee again dominates the beer. If I were interested in the idea that coffee should be the highlight of a beer, I would likely enjoy this, here, no. Slight oaty, malty beer with hints of resiny hops.

Left massive amounts of silky lacing on the glass. Nose was surprisingly light, but became more apparent as it warmed. Oodles of coffee and the darkest dark chocolate.

Smells of coffee, booze, chocolate and dark bread. The taste is incredible. Tastes of dark and bitter coffee with bittersweet chocolate overtones, and a molasses / malty sweetness. Finish has a nice residual hop bitterness and the slight taste black coffee. Overall, well balanced. Not too sweet but enough to balance the coffee and hop bitterness. The oatmeal smooths out the overall flavor nicely. Very drinkable and surprisingly not overly boozy given the almost 11% ABV. Not too cloyingly sweet like some of the other Mikkeller offerings that I have had. Awesome beer. I've got to try this one again!!!

A: Thick black body with a slowly disappearing dark mocha head. Has some nice legs.

N: Lots of coffee, char, dark chocolate, and leather. Some licorice and plenty of malt/malted milk balls. Very thick smelling, as though you can grasp the density somehow. 

T: Quite sweet at first - the malted milk comes through against an appropriate coffee bitterness. Then it becomes bitter and smoky. Perhaps a bit too much of the latter, but its still pleasant. 

M: Thick and oily. Oatmeal rounds out the mouthfeel well. Very alcoholic and can be quite sharp.

Taste is coherent with aroma, but just stretched in time - at first comes coffee, then its tart overtone, then dark&sweet chocolate, then ashy&woody, then roasty and finally bitterness of roasted barley, which last quite long.

Medium acidity, highly bitter with a sting of a bitter finish that lingers for quite some time,  medium sweet, and a velvety texture.

3456,"2012-10-15",3.8,"June 23rd, 2010 - By this point (Summer of 2010) I had heard only faint whispers about Mikkeller. My local beer store guru held him in some kind of mystical reverence, and I had seen his names plastered across forum boards, but I didnt quite understand what the fuss was about. Seeking to remedy that and my sobriety, I sampled the Beer Geek Brunch Weasel. It wears no hat, but a crown, producing very little head save for a halo of medium brown lacing around the edges of the opal black body. The smell is dark and rich, like a clod of deep, rich earth, with an oily smell too. Fresh yams and molasses and brown sugar make my stomach stir, and an edge of bitter vegetables reminds me that balance in beer and in food groups is essential. The taste mirrors the aroma - a welcome reflection. New in the flavor is a considerable pour of alcohol and a coffee bitterness to pair off again the abysmal sugars. Amongst the dark chocolate flavors, burnt and chipped sugars and molasses and harsh dark chocolate bitterness is plenty of strength and burly flavors. What I dont see is elegance, however, but a dancing troupe of elephants, crushing everything underfoot. If thats your thing, the Mikkeller Beer Geek Brunch Weasel is a top-notch brew, but I find it a little heavy handed for my taste.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

3456,"2012-08-05",4.2,"From a bottle drank in Feb 12.

Pours a jet black colour with a good finger of creamy brown head that begins to subside and thin out after a few minutes.

Surprised at the lack of aroma for such a strong, bold beer ! Roasted malt, slightly burnt sugar, coffee and tar. Dont get me wrong there are plenty of smells going off here, just not as big and brassy as Id have liked! (more smells now that the beer has warmed a little, more chocolate, stronger coffee aroma and a little alcohol)

The taste is a clear cut 2 way thing for me and no need to think too deeply and list 101 ingredients. First a wonderful bittersweet coffee flavour hits your palate, this then gives way to a real kick of alcohol in the aftertaste. I prefer the former to the latter as it is a little bit too much alcohol for me in the aftertaste. (the alcohol aftertaste is less harsh when the beer has warmed and more enjoyable)

Mouthfeel is spot on for a beer of this ilk, slick, oily and just the right level of carbonation. (continues to provide a good MF)

Overall a very good beer, but I think I expected a little more. I was expecting a stronger aroma and the alcohol aftertaste could have been better disguised, it strips away the wonderful coffee flavour a little too much and too quickly for my liking. Would definately have again though just for that first coffee hit on the palate!

3456,"2012-06-27",3.4,"Tried @ Grain Cru - Roll Out the Barrels, Belgian Beer Café.Black as midnight. Compact, tight and mostly lasting brownish crown. Very husky is the aroma; lots of smoke, bonfire ash, tar, heavily roasted coffee beans and an undeniable and well pronounced note of aniseed. A good lot of medicinal alcohol in there also that really tickles the nose. Noticeable aniseed on the palate too reminiscent of sarsparilla with its subtle sweetness. Smooth, oily and slightly viscous body, not big but filling. Chocolate icecream and bitter and sharp roasted coffee bean fuels the rest. The alcohol soothing, warming and medicinal in the heavily smoky, ashen finish. Excellent length. A little residual chocolate malt sweetness on the tongue fades the smoke and anise between sips. Didnt take me as anything special given the civet-cats arse droppings hype. Could have done away with that altogether. Not bad! (50cL, 2011, Cellarbrations Carlisle)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"
3456,"2012-06-26",3.9,"Style et résumé: Imperial Oatmeal Stout au café de civet. 
Comment: Bouteille de 500ml batch 697 un gros merci à Slovaksniper. 
Description: Bière noire opaque avec une superbe tête de mousse crémeuse. Le nez est de grain rôti, de café, et de cacao en poudre. Lalcool semble bien dissimulé. En bouche le liquide a une superbe texture. À prime abord lamertume des grains détonne, ça mord en fin de bouche. Heureusement lensemble est plus harmonieux avec le temps. La finale est longue et savoureuse. Une bonne bière mais jai préféré la version en baril de bourbon.

3456,"2012-06-24",4.5,"No clue how old this is, but it was a bit dusty. 500 ml bottle into an over sized wine glass.

A - Pitch black body lets zero light through. 2 finger high mocha head forms and settles to a nice bubbly cap. Great lacing and retention and some alcohol legs produced after swirling.

S - Ive never had civet coffee before so Im a bit inexperienced in its nuances, but the coffee aroma here is roasty but not bitter. Its hard to explain. Very sweet yet roasty coffee and malts which works great against the deep vanilla and dark chocolate notes. Really unique and fantastic.

T - Just as extraordinary as the nose. Sweet vanilla and dark chocolate followed by lightly roasty yet sweetened coffee notes. There is some slightly vinous and fruity red wine notes towards the finish as well. Syrupy and coating, with low carbonation.

O - Im not a Mikkeller fan at all. After trying three of the B/A black hole beers I gave up on buying there stuff. This bottle was given to me so I went into it rather unbiased of its price tag. But holy crap has my image of them changed. This is a phenomenal stout. I think I prefer BCBCS a bit more in terms of coffee stouts, but this is a huge achievement, I though it was going to beer an average gimmicky beer using one of the most expensive coffee beans, buts its just so damn delicious.

Its slightly sweet, and the coffee is superb (no matter where it came from). The delicious oatmeal gives the beer a crispness that makes it even tastier and more drinkable.

The chocolate and coffee flavors linger on the tongue a while.  Hard to rate this beer.  I really enjoyed getting to drink this finally.

Some bitterness from the grain comes in with a noticeable green hop flavor. The alcohol is hardly apparent. The beer has a lightly fruity yeast that flows well with the coffee.

3456,"2012-04-30",4.2,"I needed something special for my 400th rating and beer made with coffee beans that came out of a weasels ass seemed appropriate.  Strong dark roasted coffee/malt aromas coming off an opaque black body topped with a creamy light brown head.  This has to be one of the blackest beers Ive ever had.  Even under a bright halogen light I see absolutely nothing coming through and even around the bottom edge of the glass where theres usually at least some color I can only see the slightest sliver of ruby that would be completely unnoticeable otherwise.   Rich dark and bittersweet chocolate flavors as well as espresso roll across the tongue followed by an acrid bitterness that is most likely from the coffee and dark roasted malt.  This would be tough to drink except for the beautifully balanced black strap molasses sweetness that wraps up the bitter flavors and carries them away.   Theres a creamy feel to this thats simultaneously cut by the dry, woody roasted bitterness.  Theres also an earthiness to this thats hard to describe except as ""clean dirt"".   Theres some soy sauce and vanilla in there too, but theyre muted by the heavy chocolate/coffee presence.  Left behind are the tongue scrapping roasted bitterness and semi-sweet chocolate flavors.   Theres a lot going on here (not least of which is the almost 11% ABV that doesnt bite like youd expect), but theres a balance between all these massive aromas and flavors that holds this together and makes it a great, memorable beer.","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"

Appearance: black and brown with a dark brown translucent edge. Little bit of head that dissipated nicely into the dark pool.

Smell: coffee and stouty malty goodness

Taste: rich coffee and yes, the oatmeal is present. The hops come through as does the malt and it winds up just a well-done good feeling taste. Little hint of alcohol on the aftertaste keeps this from a 5.0

Mouthfeel: Brown with a nice body. Yeah.

Drinkability: the aftertaste and the high abv stop it from perfection but on taste smell and mouthfeel alone this hits as one of the best Ive had.

The appearance is nearly black, with a very pleasant creamy brown head. Although it does not exhibit great retention, there is some lace down the glass.

This has a very interesting aroma. Roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee are the most dominant. The unique coffee flavor is from the ca phe chon coffee, I imagine.

The first sip is a bit of a leap of faith for me, just because I know the ingredients. There is a very robust and unique coffee (weasel poop) flavor, with a lingering bitterness. Roasted malt, chocolate, a little vanilla, and more coffee in the finish.

The mouthfeel is smooth and very creamy, with medium carbonation, and a medium body. It is actually a little bit dry, which surprised me, but it was not off-putting.

Some fruity notes are present as well. Hints of caramel in the finish. Really dry finish, I like that.

Sweetness, like chocolate, booze, and subtle coffee. No strong guess as to which flavor will dominate the taste.

Taste:
Sweetness and oats hit me first, and then I get a blast of booze and chocolate. The chocolate is actually fairly dry feeling. Another flavor is in there too, which starts small and gradually takes over your entire mouth. What is it exactly? At first I didnt know, and then it hit me: This is ultra-rich coffee! Wow!

Mouthfeel:
Oily and thick, and mouth-coating. You could chew on this stuff like gum.

Overall:
Im pretty sure I would drink this with breakfast. It would be delicious. The only thing stopping me is the 10.9% ABV. Im a little concerned about having it for lunch, in fact. glad Im not driving today. Other than that, this stout is fantastic. A coffee-lovers stout, and a stout-lovers breakfast.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"

3456,"2011-09-05",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 5, 2011 Black with a rich warm-brown head that is 8mm thick but fades to naught within a minute.  Aroma is earthy sap and coffee- tons of it.  A bit of sweetness, warm caramel.  Thick palate with prickly carbonation.  Moderate sweetness up front (caramal notes are masked by other stuff).  Packed with flavor! but not BBQ or Soy sauces.  Earthy, piney, sappy hops covering a big coffee flavor.  Theres so much going on here that it covers any of the stale coffee flavors that might otherwise be present (as there are in other coffee stouts.)  Burnt toast, nuts, and oats.

3456,"2011-08-29",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 21, 2012 This stout is so dark and thick that from its pour you might be led to think its crude oil (or at least a kind of it that happens to develop a minimal tan head as it is poured). Speaking of head, it is so minimal that I only speak of it because convention tells me to. The aroma is damn impressive, with sweet, delicate Kopi Luwak coffee; roasted malts (which do come through nicely, despite the coffee addition), elegant hops, and alcohol. Overall, the nose is not exactly boozy, but the alcohol is not as elegantly tuned into it as it is in, say, Stone IRS. The taste is mostly bitter, with some sweetness coming from the Kopi Luwak, but I thought I was going to get more of a coffee character here. The coffee is very mellow and, really, second to the roasted malts. The palate is very thick and elegantly carbonated. It may well be too thick for some, but I think it suits the style perfectly. This is some heavyweight stuff. Its not as Civet Coffeeoriented as I thought it would be, but God, it is lovely. I just wish the alcohol didnt become so obvious past a certain temperature.

Some vanilla notes midway through my glass. After taking my notes, I looked up more details on this coffee, and found that ""weasel coffee"" is supposedly made much more mellow, even fermented, by enzymes during its trip through the critters GI. Not having tried the actual coffee, I can only say its reported characteristics come out very nicely in this beer. Ive also learned that Vietnamese researchers have isolated the enzymes that make the coffee and may be mass producing it, as the ca phe chon civet is possibly endangered.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

I dont often drink coffee, but when I do, I prefer Vietnamese coffee...and this Vietnamese coffee has created the most delicious coffee taste I have ever gotten from a beer.

This one pours a deep, pitch black color and topped by a thick head of dark mocha colored foam that slowly settles to a thin film and leaves sticky sheets of legging around the glass. It definitely looks the part of a nice imperial stout. The aroma shows very roasty with a huge coffee influence with freshly roasted, dark, earthy coffee being the primary focus, while bitter dark chocolate and burnt caramel provide a nice malt base to help counter all the roasted coffee. The flavor follows and shows a nice balance between the darkly roasted coffee and earthen hop bitterness with the dark chocolate and burnt caramel malt sweetness. The coffee and hops add ample bitterness throughout, but the chocolate and caramel really keep things in check and smooth things out nicely. Nearly full bodied and very smooth on the palate with balanced carbonation that leads to a dry, roasted finish. This is a top notch coffee stout and one of the best that I have tried.

High roast, lots of coffee, medium body, lots of backend bitterness from the coffee. This beer is really really strong. Drinkability suffers from strength.

3456,"2011-03-10",4.6,"500ml bottle. This is an amped up version of the original it appears.

It pours a pitch black, not quite motor oil thickness looking on the pour but pretty close. The head is big, crystalline and tan. It looks awesome. This beer has a simple but electrifying look to it, mainly thanks to the alluring head.

The smell is a bit of a curve ball, there are a lot more hops here than I would have expected. The coffee is there too, but a bit more subdued than I expected. It smells extremely fruity, I havent personally had the weasel poop coffee on its own so maybe the fruitiness is coming form that along with the hops, but I;m not sure. There is also some chocolate and toffee scents. 

The flavor is super rich and the mouthfeel is THICK. It is sweet but not quite overpoweringly so. The coffee flavor is a lot more prevalent in the taste, it also has a lot of hops. There is a certain spiciness to this brew that is also intriguing. It is very cinnamony. This is a very bitter one for a stout, both the roasted notes and the hops bring the bitterness in full force. it mellows out eventually and the sweetness dies down after a few sips and it becomes a roasty chocolatey beast. edit, maybe it was too cold when i first started (20 min in the freezer) but it jsut keeps getting better, the fruitiness is really starting to open up.

It is an interesting beer, this is one solid American-inspired Imperial stout.

Coffee hits the nose right up front followed by a big malty aroma. Chocolate and vanilla mixed with caramel follows up.
Again the coffee comes into play right away. But it is nicely balanced by the big malt and sweetness. Tastes of chocolate lingers around for a bit. Kind of like someone poured some chocolate in this, but not much.
Coats the mouth just like motor oil. And stains the glass as well. Sticks around in your mouth enough that you dont have to take another sip for a little bit, which is good considering how big this beer is and the size of the bottle.

This is one of the best imperial stouts in the world, and I was very fortunate to receive this bottle in a trade, totally unannounced. This beer is brewed in Belgium and is made from the most expensive coffee on Earth. The coffee beans are eaten by a Civet Cat in southeast Asia, is digested and defecated out. These beans are picked out of the poop and used in the brewing of this beer. If that doesnt make you want this beer, nothing will. It pours a very dark black color with a beige head. Swirling it around creates a nice resiny color on the edges of the glass. The aroma is very nice. Coffee, dark chocolate, sweet malts and residual sugars. A bit of toasted notes also on the nose.

The flavor is incredible.  Its a coffee flavor, but not the typical coffee beer coffee flavor.  This is complex, acidic, with lots of little tropical fruit notes.

4.5 A: Pitch black. Two plus fingers of creamy/frothy hyrbrid medium brown head. Very good retention and moderate spotty lacing.

5.0 S: Really nice here. Rich depth of aroma, probably from the poop residue, haha. In all seriousness, great balance between the sweet and the roasted. Good bit of roasted barley, some toastiness, medium roasted coffee, and loads of semi-sweet chocolate. Everything is big, bold, and complementary.

4.0 T: Taste is very good as well, but not as good as the nose. Roastiness is plentiful and gives a decent bitterness, cancelling out the lack of bitterness from the shit beans. Coffee flavor is plentiful, but much of the chocolate in the nose is not present here. Blackstrap molasses, slight citrusy hoppiness, and the smallest touch of plum fruitiness. Alcohol is hidden fairly well.

3.5 M: Medium body. This is the only problem I have with this brew. The body is lighter and less chewy than Id like. The carbonation is fine, but the beer still feels dead. Warming alcohol on finish.

3456,"2011-01-18",4.8,"UPDATED: JUL 23, 2013 Pour is onyx with virtually no light penetrating the beer. The head developed about one finger thick and was a tan brown color. Head retention is short as it quickly fades back into the beer. Trace amounts of lacing occurred.

The aroma from this brew is absolutely mouth-watering for anyone who likes coffee (or chocolate or beer for that matter). The immediate and dominant smell is of potent coffee but the beautiful thing is that despite the potency a myriad of other aromas still break through. It took me near 20 sniffs to identify what individual notes I could but I believe I smell dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, molasses, dark fruits, licorice, and a light hoppiness.

Tasting the beer reveals an immensely complicated grouping of flavors. Coffee, dark chocolate, and dark malts are at the forefront. These three stick out and dominate the first touch of the beer to the tongue. It is very well-balanced. The initial tastes yield to more subdued notes of dark fruits, nuts, and oats. The finish is a touch acidic and the coffee aftertaste lingers long after the swallow. The quality of the world-class coffee used is evident.

This beer has the most impressive mouthfeel I have yet experienced. It is very smooth and almost creamy. It can only be described as thick as it feels as if your mouth is both filled and coated with beer simultaneously. The carbonation is very fine. The mouthfeel compliments the tasting but allows the tasting to shine - as it should.

The alcohol content of 10.9% is amazingly well hidden; however, I could feel its presence after having had to consume this beauty in a fairly short time. This isnt a session beer but goes down easy enough.

This is the best beer I have tried to date. I feel privileged to have been able to even have a bottle. I am afraid this is a must-buy whenever I see it. The journey of flavors this beer took me on left me sitting on my couch with my empty glass in hand feeling content, relaxed, and sporting a goofy smile. If that isnt a summary of what a brewer should be aiming for, I dont know what is.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","gramity"

3456,"2011-01-10",4.7,"Már a megjelenése beszakítja az asztalt. A színe tömény, átlátszatlan barnásfekete. A csurgása félelmetes, úgy mászik ki az üvegből, mint valami nyugodtan tekergő fekete kígyó. Valóban az egyik legsúlyosabb kinézetű sör, alig lehet rá habot produkálni, de aztán beindul, és akkor abszurdul magas sötétbarna habot vet, ami lassan elmúlik és finom csipke marad a helyén.

Az illata csodálatos likőrbe forduló pörköltmaláta illat, nagyon malátás, mintha sörcefrébe szagolnánk, fullasztó  nem is igazi sörillat, inkább a sör ideájának illata.

Hosszan nézzük a farkasszemet, ezt a kóstolást nem lehet elkapkodni. A söröm megtévesztésig hasonlít egy pohár folyékony tortabevonóra. Végül csak belekortyolok.
Sűrű és olajos. Az első korty sok apró szénsavas molekulával kezdődik, abból a fajtából, ami nem engedi, hogy nagy kortyot igyál. Aztán a a szájpadlást elárasztja egy erős melaszos édesség, ami szinte azonnal fekete csokoládévá dúsul, miközben meggyes, fanyar pillérekkel támaszkodik az oldalsó ízlelőbimbóinkra, és mielőtt az utóíz némi lágyabb karbonáció keretében kifejlődne, a maláta megmutatja száraz, földes pörköltségét, miközben egy pillanatra megvillan a komló zöld keserűsége. Aztán az utóíz - földes, feketekávés, feketecsokoládés, alkoholos, likőrös. Közben szinte csípős is, annyira intenzív. Ha túl nagy kortyot iszom belőle, már fájnak az ízek, mar a kakaóssága.

Ugye tudjuk, miről szól ez a kávé? A dél-ássziai civet-macska potyadékából nyerik ki a világ legdrágább kávéját, és azzal főzik ezt a sört. A civet-macska imádja a kávét, jól megeszi, aztán a beleiben elkezdi megemészteni, de ennek nem jut a végére, mert még azelőtt kiadja hátul. Szorgalmas délázsiaik ezt összegyűjtik, kibogarásszák belőle a kávészemeket, és arcpirító áron adják el. Nekem ugyan még nem volt szerencsém efféle kávéhoz, de állítólag a magas ár nem az ürülékben való turkászás okozta megaláztatás ára, hanem az ízé. A civetmacska emésztőnedvei különleges aromává fermentálják a kávé ízanyagait.

A Ca Phe Con kávé is ilyen, igaz csak a világ második legdrágább kávéja  ezt adja a dán Borg Bjergsø, a Mikkeller vándorsörfőzde sörmestere a Beer Geek Brunchhoz, amit a Nøgne ø sörfőzdében főz.

A kávé-stout nem egy ritka műfaj, pláne a posztmodern sörfőzők szeretik főzni, mert könnyen elmondható a koncepció, de annál ritkábban képvisel igazi különleges minőséget. A kávé gyakran a komplexitás rovására megy, és ha túl karakterisztikus, lejátssza a színpadról a kifinomultabb pöröltségeket. A Beer Geek Brunch nem ilyen.

Ennek az íze nem is emlékeztet kávéra, mondhatni, hogy a kávé eszenciája van benne. Miközben tökéletesen sörszerű, és senkinek nincs olyan érzése, hogy kávét löttyintettek volna bele. A kávénak ugyanis csak a legnemesebb illatos, fűszeres, szerecsendiós, boros aromái vonulnak fel, a BGB pörköltsége teljesen a malátáé. Egy mesebeli kávé íze, remegő tökéletesség, trópusi gazdagságú íz Dániából: fekete katedrális.
Ahogy melegszik, jönnek elő a gyümölcsök  mazsola, meggy  illetve a vanília. Kezd érvényesülni a belefőzött zabpehely selymes csúszóssága, egyre selymesebb, és egyre sziruposabb, miközben az íze csontszáraz. Kiborító, hogy egyszerre ennyire száraz és ennyire édes. Érzelmileg leterhel, ennyi örömet egy menetben meginni  nem is lehet. Már három korty után szívdobogást kaptam, és amikor az ember feláll, kiderül, hogy nincs izom a lábában. Majdnem 11% alkohol van benne. Egy két decis adagot eltettem a hűtőbe és jó pár órával később fejeztem be  semmi nem történt vele.","HUNGARY","tonycaviar"

A: Pours a very, very dark brown with a good amount of bright-brown head. Plenty of carbonation and excellent lacing.

S: Sweet espresso and dark cherries coming in over and plenty of dark, bitter coffee.

T: Not getting much of the oatmeal, but the coffee is definitely present in large amounts. There are some hints of bitter dark chocolate, as well as some sweetness, mostly consonant with dark dried cherries.

M: Medium to full bodied without a ton of carbonation. The alcohol is present, but not overpowering.

D: Lacking in complexity compared with the gems of the style. Still, however, a very nice brew.

A completely black beer with a nice head, however duration is not the best. Aroma is loaded with chocolate and has nice smells of cappucino coffee and cascade hops too. Flavor is chocolate, flowers, hops and has a nice bitter hoppy ending, but never too much in anyway. A fantastic stout with nice and rare touches of floral hops at the same time as the demanded heavy elements. The palate is unbelievable smooth, but never thin.

Bottle. Little foam with nice compact bubbles in it. The head remained quite long. Darkest beer Ive ever seen, reminds me of licorice candy. Strong, but very nice smell of coffee, a bit roasty.
Taste has a more relaxed coffee hint, it has some sweet and also some bitter tones, but it seems very balanced, however complex. Every sip allowed something new to be discovered.
Palate was different from anything Ive had so far, very nice carbonation along with the soft ""olive-oil""  like texture. At least, thats what it reminded me of. Overall a very different, nevertheless tasty experience.","Utrecht/Wageningen, NETHERLANDS","jaspe007"

3456,"2010-10-29",4.2,"500ml bottle bb 23.03.11
RIDICULOUSLY dark looking stout, very much a contender for the darkest ive come across. The colour of the head alone is enough to put some brown ales to shame, and it just hangs there, painting lace on the glass, atop a viscous black liquid id mistake for sump oil, if I didnt know any better.
Aroma is seriously intense. Saying it smells like coffee is a huge understatement; its like coffee on steroids! Very earthy, like a good moist fertile black clay in a forest of giant ancient rainforest trees. Lots of rich cocoa, charcoal and nutmeg spice in there too, and, despite everything else, theres some discernable hop and cereally malt aroma in there, some what timidly.
Slick, oily, silky texture with low carbonation seems to, once again, allude to this being more of an oil than a beer, but im not fooled so easily with a lingering acrid coffee/roast malt note drying out the palate and lingering.
If the nose was intense, the flavour is off the charts; more of the same earthy, spicy, cocoa-y, vanilla-y, tarry, charred, flavour with a belt of what almost feels like hop resin in amongst it. Initially somewhat sweet, the long palate finishes with a bitterness that verges on being over-the-top; and being almost any other beer itd seem that way, but the overall richness and complexity takes it in its stride. 
And, not after long, that big abv kicks in, undetectable until you have to get out of your chair!

Surprisingly light and silky mouthfeel but it coats your mouth. Finishes with some bitterness from strong cold coffee and bitter chocolate.

Flavor is insanely rich, just bursting on the tongue with extremely oily coffee, espresso, again very fruity as well, surprisingly so considering the richness of the coffee. Very complex and balanced between the sweet chocolate and fruit and bitter coffee beans and espresso. Full oily and sticky body with a soft carbonation.

3456,"2010-10-14",4.2,"bottle.  Pours deep black oil with dark brown creamy looking head, which quickly fades to a faint ring.  Aroma of vanilla, dark chocolate, creme brulee, soft but rich coffee tones.  The coffee aspect is more present in the flavor than in the aroma, but not in an overpowering way.  The initial flavor is quite sweet, which then turns to deep, roasty tones, to finally an interesting bittersweet resin aspect on the finish.  Mouth feel is slick and smooth, velvety, creamy, slightly oily, with subtle alcohol sensation on the finish.  Similarly to the black hole stout, here as it warms some very soft, subtle yet still noticeable fruit tones come out, perhaps raspberry, although this is overall less fruity and sweet than the black hole and more roasty and rich.  While in some coffee stouts / porters I find the coffee aspect to be the only endearing aspect, or overdone, here the coffee is both very rich and adding to this beer yet not more than it should.  Ultimately this is an excellent imperial stout although better ones are conceivable, I thought their black hole was better for example.  Still, this is highly recommended for anyone looking to try to tier imp. stouts on the market.","Denver, Colorado, USA","tennessejed420"

The smell reminds me of a good coffee shop with mocha and espresso tones just kind of all over the place. There is some paint oddness as well. The flavor is boozy with notes of bourbon and brandy with vanilla and deep fruit respectively along with some woody earthy tones. Obviously this is very coffee driven and plenty roasty.

Late hint of alcohol and a hit of hop and black coffee bitterness. Lenghty aftertaste of coffee. Smooth and viscous in the mouth, but actually a bit lighter mouthfeel than expected. Soft carbonation.

A - Pitch black color, even on the hues. Large, incredibly thick, creamy, rocky, sticky, cafe colored head with amazing retention that finally settles into a nice creamy, sticky layer of lace. Looks amazing.
 
S - Wonderful smelling beer. Rich coffee is obviously strong but there is also a strong dark chocolate and roasted dark malt aroma. Good amount of caramel and molasses sweetness as well. Some nutty and earthy aroma and a touch of alcohol are also vaguely present in the background.
 
T - Strong roasted espresso starts off the taste. Quickly rich chocolate, caramel, molasses, and cream flavors come in to provide a touch of sweetness along with the coffee taste. A touch of earthy, nuttiness comes out mid sip as well. A good amount of vanilla is also present and just a hint of anise. Roasted oatmeal has a good undertone throughout the sip that doesnt dominate but provides a bit of a backbone to the beer. Delicious, rich coffee is persistent along with a nice chocolate and sweetness to balance out the roasted bitterness.

M - Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Smooth and creamy. Just a bit of a chewiness, but not as much I was expecting from an oatmeal stout.

D - Very easy to drink beer with a nice balance of coffee and other flavors, especially the sweeter ones. 

Notes: Bottled 03/11/08. Very good coffee stout. Strong coffee flavor, but also has a good amount of traditional oatmeal stout flavor, and a nice chocolaty and sweetness (and some creaminess). Went incredibly well with breakfast. Wonderful beer, definitely worth picking up.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

3456,"2010-07-26",4.3,"500 ml bottle from Holiday Wine Cellar ($14.99).  Glad that I finally found this highly anticipated beer (currently #27 on the RateBeer Top 50).  Pours an absolute pitch black with a couple fingers of the brownest head I think Ive ever seen.  Aroma is of course very complex -- Im catching various notes of dirty earthy organic coffee, soy sauce, tar, cigarettes, smoke and ash, burnt dark chocolate, and perhaps some vague bit of dark fruit.  Flavor of super dark coffee (I somehow imagine the result of the little Vietnamese coffee brew-things without the sweetened condensed milk at the bottom), straight espresso beans, dark chocolate that seems to be straight cacao beans, burnt chocolate, ash/cigarettes.  As it warms, I get some lighter sweeter tones of fruit and berries.  Even more so than Mikkellers aptly named Dark Hole, this beer seems to be all about all things dark and dank -- almost overly so, actually, as I would like a bit more sweetness in this to get closer to perfection (or maybe Im just spoiled on Speedway and Victory at Sea living here in San Diego).  Finishes with a bitter burnt malt flavor.  It seems that the tastes are so intense that the high ABV is completely concealed.  Your taste buds will need a break after the intensity of this one.

3456,"2010-07-24",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2010 This pours out dark as pitch smoke with a thick, brown creamy head.  There is a slight ebony edging, but nothing more than two millimeters.  The nose is the blackest, woodiest espresso and then sweet, ashy malts which counter the bitterness giving this a perfect balance.  Mikkellers soy sauce aroma is here but theres also a strange whiff of gherkins or pickled onions.  Then under that comes cinnamon.  In the mouth the coffee explodes into tobacco and chocolate; once again the hops act as a counter balance.  Im amazed.  Its all too easy to become sycophantic about this, but truth be told its the best beer Ive ever had.  The development of aroma to taste is something else; the look is perfect; and the finish, which increases the nutty, woody, tart, sweetness of the espresso, is nothing short of brilliant.  If passing along a weasels digestive tract makes coffee this good, then lets process everything through them.  Give them chocolate, birthday cake, mushrooms, potato chips.  And why stop there?  Lets feed them whole bottles of beer.  Just follow a weasel around and eat whatever it shits.  And can you imagine if a civet cat ate another civet cats poo?

Bottle. Just had myself the bottled edition of this wonderful beer, and was quickly forced to acknowledge the sheer enormity of this brew.

First taste is wild of coffee, followed by black licorice and booze, and root beer?!  The abc is well-hidden for now, but I suspect it will become more obvious as the beer warms, which shouldnt take long on this hot night.  Such an interesting impy stout...

Some alcohol is there as well.  The first taste is quite warming, with notes of wood and raspberry/cherry cascading down with coffee and roasted chocolate flavors.  Its a thick beer, the sipping kind.  Feels like I should be snowed in someplace drinking this for warmth.

Nose is seriously inviting, has cookie-dough, molasses, and brown sugar notes combining with a sweet, and maybe even so slightly smokey coffee characteristic, resulting in a dessertish, yet with the smokey influence, refined olfactory experience.  Flavors again give way to notes of cookie, molasses, and brown sugar with the coffee notes being joined by some fairly sweet chocolate touches, evident yet still only balancing hop bite, warm and only slightly suggestive alcohol undertones, and a finish that emphases the hop bite and the acidic and slightly smokey coffee edge while dropping a little bit of the sweetness.  I really like the cookie/brown sugar/slightly smokey coffee characteristics...the hop level may be a bit brash in the finish, but possible not..the alcohol is not hidden per se, but it certainly compliments most of everything else thats going on..undecided to whether i think its too sweet or not...but Ill probably know by the end of the bottle.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"

The taste had coffee, chocolate, dark fruits, very grainy, roasted, burnt, and the mouthfeel was very creamy. I love coffee beers, but I like them fresh better. I feel like this beer is probably best when fresh as the coffee is more pronounced. Will seek ought the newest batch.","San Antonio, Texas, USA","Hopper"

The aromas were so rich and organic. Brilliant velvety oatmeal, dark burn chocolate malt, lovely rich espresso coffee, and a hint of dry hop. The flavor is just outrageous. Dark chocolate covered espresso beans, silky oatmeal, bright dark malt, bitter coffee, all with a great hop bite at then end brings the palate dry and refreshed.

Pours jet black and side by side with Beer Geek Breakfast.  What a different beer!

Aroma was thick dark roasted espresso with some vanilla and chocolate.

Flavor was beautiful bitter smooth coffee.

Mouthfeel is where the biggest difference in the beers comes.  The weasel is medium bodied with decent carb, but feels so slick on the tongue and goes down so easily.

Overall, this is one of the best coffee beers in the world and, when compared to beer geek breakfast, demonstrates the difference of using quality coffee in brewing.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","cprochak"

Flavor of coffee, caramel malts, roast, tart dark fruits (berries, plums, figs), metallic notes, cocoa beans, brown sugar, molasses, smoked wood, and alcohol.

It is extremely thick and creamy, a step above full bodied. Then the flavours of coffee and chocolate wash over you, a liquid dessert. It finishes very dry, and the coffee taste lingers for ages.

3456,"2010-06-04",4.1,"500 mL bottle from West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago, served in a snifter. Pours deep black with a tall, rocky light brown head. Some proteinaceous sludge escaped from the bottle. The carbonation is initially vigorous, but it settles quickly to become quite soft. As it does, the head fades down to a thin cover and eventually to nothing at all. The aroma is big coffee with chocolate, yeast, nuts, burnt malt and smoke. The flavour reflects the aroma: it is moderately sweet throughout with strong bitterness and acidity entering in the latter half. The finish is lingering malt. On the palate, it feels thick and creamy, with a smooth texture. The finish is moderately astringent. Overall, a very nice imperial stout. The aroma is not as complex as it could be but the flavour evolves nicely. Very drinkable: its hard to believe this is 10.9% ABV. While the sludge was slightly off-putting, the oatmeal makes for a very interesting texture in an imperial stout. Well worth a try (or two). 2010-06-04","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"

The initial bite is a slight alcohol flavor followed by the roasted malts and coffee. For 10.9%, the alocohol is actully hidden pretty well.

When cold, this stuff was practically undrinkable -- all harsh coffee roast bittern acidity -- but with temp it opens up to a mildly sweetened coffee, black cherry, rum raisin, maple beauty without being too bitter, nor too sweet. Nice balance for a big stout like this. Unctuous feel with late prickly eff.

Full bodied with a rich and thick palate.  Great complexity.  Acidic and tangy.  Really nice roasted quality.  Flavors of coffee and brownies with a touch of fudge.

3456,"2010-02-17",4.0,"Bottle. Pours and oily jet black with a very dense coffee coloured head. Minimal lacing.  Aromas are huge and very complex. Plenty of sweet and roasted malt, black coffee, some resiny hops and dark toffee. Flavours are quite sweet upfront with the malt and coffee showing through. Finish is quite bitter thanks to the roasted malt and hops. Very bitter and quite long lasting resiny hop after taste. Quite oily and full bodied there is very little carbonation. Difficult to drink more than one, to me the very bitter finish detracts from the wonderful coffee aromas and flavours. Still a very good beer all the same.","AUSTRALIA","bluebetty"

3456,"2010-02-09",4.3,"Dark black with some red around the edges; medium tan head. Aroma of the finest and best weasel droppings Ive yet to smell. Flavor - well, this really got me by surprise, as none of it is in the aroma. A ton of roasty coffee flavors; coffee bean oils. Unmistakeable aftertaste of some exquisite weasel droppings. Really, it sounds like a gimmick, and it is in fact a little strange, but this adds something entirely unique to this beer that you just wont find in anything else. As far as the coffee goes, the effect reminds me of the best bottles of Peche Mortel, a flavor to truly relish. Light carbonation; light-medium sweetness; very slightly boozy but just perfect in that regard. Just an incredible beer, well worth getting my hands on this one.","Medford, Massachusetts, USA","minch25"

3456,"2010-02-09",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 25, 2010 Absolutely brilliant! A thich aroma of coffee, roasted malts and a hint of chocolate and a wall of taste of coffee and pure niceness.
Re-rate: The fist rating I did on this beer was obviously merely based on my memories of the beer, thus the lack of detail. Here is a more thorough review. The pour is dark as the night with a stunning dense brown head with the color like the foam of an espresso. The nose has coffee, chocolate, burnt caramel, brown sugar, dark ripe fruit, a hint of vanilla, hops. As you give it a swirl in the glass, a lot of sweetness comes in the shape of vanilla fudge and caramel. Really roasted and complex aroma. The taste is amazing. The chocolaty and coffeeish at first, then some dark fruits again as in the aroma, some hops, and just a wall of roasted espresso in the aftertaste along with some hops. Really really amazing. Delicious palate, very creamy, very viscous, full bodied. Phenomenal brew, nothing less.","Copenhagen (formerly Aalborg), DENMARK","phredrik"

3456,"2010-02-06",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 23, 2010 Now THIS is what I call a stout. In fact, it is so stout it can take on Al-Quaida singel-handedly by swirling an inch of its caramel head around, having coffee and almost-burnt-malts volley through the air like tastebud-seeking missiles. This is as deep, strong and good as a coffee stout will ever be. Perhaps not surprisingly, considering they come up with inventive ideas like having us eat weasel shit. Who the hell came up with that idea anyhow?? It matters not, however; I will more than willingly sip through a whole public toilets worth of this stuff - smooth opening, then the kick of alcohol and coffee blended close to perfection. Within its genre, its absolutely astounding. I had an espresso flavor lingering in my mouth for more than 15 minutes after the last sip, and I think this is a beer every stout fan should experience before their final hour. Just go get it.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

3456,"2010-01-31",4.7,"50cl bottle from a trade with TheWolf, thanks Rene.  I had this in March 2009 when I bought a bottle at the Planet Thanet BF in Margate and it was outstanding (especially after Martyn from the Butchers Arms got some of the carbonation out of it to open up the flavours ).  So I came to this beer sober, but ecstatic after Man Utds 3-1 win over Arsenal and with good memories of it from a year ago plus all of the expectation having seen it in the top 50.  Its black as black can be with a thin lasting tan head.  A lot of the carbonation that had been there 10 months ago has gone.  Thats not to say that it doesnt retain its head, it does.  The aroma is pure luxury.  A velvet coffee sumptiousness with rich dark bitter chocolate.  In the mouth, its incredibly smooth and elegant.  Where some of the big American impy stouts can lose their way with soy sauce or being overly roasty, this caresses the palate perfectly.  The swallow is silky, smooth and abundantly beautiful.  The finishing coffee kick is outrageously good.  A bit like Nanis skill for Uniteds first goal, you saw/tasted it and went ""wow!!""  yes, intense coffee, but never powdery and for something so intense, not unbalanced.  Just a touch of heat on the finish tells you about the ABV level.  That and the glorious feeling inside my head.  But thats from both the sublime flavours and texture of this beer as well as the excitement that both it is as good as the first time i had it and also that I have another bottle upstairs.  As I was typing this, the lights kept going off in the kitchen without warning.  Even the electricity was in awe of this beer.  Bitter, but never too bitter on the finish.  God, that is intense.  But so drinkable as well.   If I have a new beer as good as this again this year, Ill be impressed.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

3456,"2010-01-22",4.7,"A Mes rate. Bottle at home with David.Ive had maybe 7 or 8 bottles of this now. Figured I should get round to rating it. If ever a beer was worth a five for appearance, this is it. Pitch black, thick and viscous with a thin properly brown head that can be replenished at will with a swill, leaving excellent glass coating lace. Smell... bloody hell. Outstanding. Unreal chocolate, stunning coffee, sugar, dark fruit, leather and rich creamy alcohol. Nothing like as much poo as the original cask version had. (Once again, thanks to Mikkel and Henrik for letting us help ourselves that night at the festival.) The flavour is just ridiculously good. Each sip seams to taste slightly different. Chocolate of a glorious Belgian variety mixed with a hint of U.S. sweetness. Coffee, yup, its Kopi Loewak, what can I say? Its as good as it gets. The bitterness is perfect, the roasty character is equally so, DAMN its good. The alcohol is clear but just absolutely adorable. One of those erm, go on... get me drunk you crazy bastard type beers. Toasted bread. Lots of rawhide leathery madness and just a hint of sourness. Finish? Seriously, does it actually finish? It just runs on to the next sip. Big lengthy bitterness and some almost bretty type notes roll around in the mouth as long as you fancy waiting to sample the crazy chocolate and coffee front end again. Creamy dreamy palate with absolutely perfect carbonation for the rest of the beer. Enough to make it lively, enough to wash it down and make it surprisingly drinkable, not too much to take away the flavour and silky goodness. Finesse is through the roof. An absolute delight. Ive tried all the other versions of this crazy stuff and this is without a doubt the best one. It wants for nothing. Mikkeller are world class, in my personal top five in the world. For me, call me crazy, this is their best beer.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

3456,"2010-01-12",5.0,"At 4:20 Rome. Great looking warm-black coloured beer with a beautiful ultra fine bubbled head on top. Aroma reveals a spectrum of complex coffee sensation, some accents of fine hops with herbal characteristics like mint and ferns, touches of fresh vanilla, brown Rhum, leather, honey, maple sirup, a complex touch of fine roasted malts and hints of nuts. The taste is just fantastic, first, the alcohol is very well hidden and for such a big beer, it remains extreemly refined and elegant. There is allot going on with the taste of this fantastic beer, it has a smooth mouthfeel with a very fine carbonation and a touch of velvet angels. The coffee sensation are amazing yet not overpowering wich is good. The great malt selection is the real backbone of this beer, it has some dry malty edges that puts the refreshing hops in the spotlights and also gives it some complex earthy notes to it. The more round malts used in this beer accentuates the nutty, honeyed and more bisquit like smoothness in this brew combined with some underlaying touches of dried fruits such a raisins. The roasted part is most amazing due to the professionalisme of the brewer, he knows like no other how to combine a top coffee like ca phe chon with torrefied malts. This is a real treat, a symphonie of aroma and taste ""SHIT what a beer"". Aftertaste is rich, refined, super complex and very very long.

Flavour is full of coffee, alcohol, dark chocolate and brown sugar and also some spices. It is rather acidic too and to be honest I find it to make the flavour a bit unbalanced. Mouthfeel is rather smooth, but the carbonation is actually a bit too strong. This beer is very good, no question about it, my expectations were so high that it still is a bit of a disappointment to me, every time I open a Mikkeller brew I expect perfection and this one is a little short of that.

3456,"2009-11-15",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 19, 2010 Poured from bottle into nonic.

A - Pours a dark brown, almost black. A really nice light chocolate-colored head that is pretty frothy upon an aggressive pour. The head lingers around a bit and once it starts to disipitate it leaves a good amount of sticky lacing along the sides of the nonic.

S - Lots of coffee: really really excellent smelling coffee. Maybe some chocolate in there as well, but the coffee is pretty upfront and doesnt go anywhere.

T - Sweet chocolate covered coffee beans is the main note I get from this one. You can tell the Civet coffee this brew was made with is superb in quality, its really good. Nice bitter finish.

M - Think, but not too thick. Just right for me - medium bodied. Really smooth and rich with the perfect amount of carbonation.

D - An awesome coffee stout, no doubt about it. A little pricey, which hurts the drinkability, but thats about the only thing that I could think of for me not to drink this one whenever Im looking one of the best coffee stouts.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Sean9689"

3456,"2009-11-03",4.3,"Thick, jet black liquid. One fingered brownish airy head that dissipates quickly. Basically no lacings.

Strong coffee aromas mostly resembling hard-roasted coffee beans, but also powerful espresso. Plenty of dark chocolate. Roasted, almost burnt malts. Some charred wood and tannins. A very dense and powerful smell.

The taste is full of rich espresso flavors. A wonderful taste of freshly brewed coffee and freshly grounded coffee beans. Notes of dark chocolate tries to balance the powerful coffee flavors, but dont really succeed. A faint but prominent taste of vanilla. Hard-roasted malts mix with wood and coal. Perhaps some fruity notes, but they are very faint. The finish is quite bitter actually with hints of tannins, hop aromas, some vanilla sugar and lingering coffee notes.

Very full bodied and very viscous - like old engine oil. Very restrained carbonation. Feels fantastic in the mouth.

A great coffee stout. Not very balanced though, as the powerful coffee flavors dominate. Still fairly complex. Highly recommended.

The legs on this sucker are amazing, too. It coats the glass. Taste is much better: nicely balanced hops persist throughout, with smoke, tar, charcoal notes. Bringing it all together is the robust and smooth coffee that has the most wonderful mouthfeel. It feels like finely powdered coffee -- not gritty at all -- is floating in the beer. Its like velvet.

Rich and malty, with lots of roasted grains, prunes, a touch of coffee and some other dark fruit.  Some vinuous notes also.  Color is essentially black.  Strong roasted grains in the flavor.  A bit of carbon, rich but smooth coffee, milk chocolate and a bit of spruce late swallow.  Probably from the hops.  Thick and chewy palate which could be derived from some oats in there.

Appearance is what you expect of such a highly rated imperial stout; pitch black with a thick foamy tan head and heavy lacing. In the aroma, we get a lot of hop freshness, freshly ground coffee beans, some milk-stout like lactic acidity and vanilla sweetness and a bit of spice (maybe fresh ginger). Taste comes in vanilla-sweet at first and turns into heavy coffee bitterness that leaves a very dry long lasting finale as a mouthfeel.

The aroma is intense and I could smell the waft of roasted goodness instantly once the bottle was cracked. I only slightly chilled this beer to really get the full potential of the aroma. Roasted coffee notes hit the nose straight up, with underlying notes of oats, chocolate, molasses and as it warmed further some brandied dark fruit coming through. To drink or not to drink was never the question. Delicious flavours of fresh roasted coffee bean, chocolate, oats, vanilla, dark fruit and hops. Wow! Silky smooth on the palate. The balance of the complete beer is pure craftsmanship. A superb finish to the beer as well, with more roasted coffee that lingers until way past breakfast the next morning. Amazing stuff.

Fullish body with lots of lively carbonation, creamy, carbonated from start to finish.  Slightly sticky.

Although the coffee doesnt lend a mild milky sweetness to the palate this ber is essentially a stern cellaring style. Lots of dark bitter chocolate and roast drives a fairly aggressively flavoured mid palate, and such is the intensity that the malt flavours do appear to tail off a touch at the finish. Hops jump out at the finish, very firm and bitter, and to my taste they kill off any heat or sweetness from the alcohol.

Solid, generous aroma of charred malts and chocolate; the coffee presence in this seems secondary, or else very low in acidity; nicely integrated, well-roasted malt presence; pleasant approach. Medium-to-full mouthfeel: velvety presence in the mouth, kept lively by a healthy dose of juicy, citrus and pine bitterness on the perimeter; the core is lush amounts of well-roasted coffee and bitter chocolate, hints of smoke and chewy caramel-laden malts; I wasnt overwhelmed by this at first; it comes off as a muted impy stout (esp. at almost 11%), but the coffee presence is soft and minimally acidic, this is highly drinkable for its size, and theres nothing close to a show of overt alcohol; very smooth and impressively done.

Pours a pitchblack opaque pour, fairly thick, some midnight over ruby notes in the pour itself, a big dark brown brooding head that laces well, sticks around in a pretty big amount. Aromas are a good bittering hop, roasted bitter coffee, dark chocolate with a touch of sweetness mixing between well roasted malts, a bit of caramel, darker coffee, a light sweetness underneath but a coffee and hop bomb it appears. Initial is thick, giving a full mouthfeel, immediately roasted coffee, bitter hops, roasted malts, dark bitter chocolate, dryness, oat and cereal malts well roasted, some caramel sweetness underneath. The coffee on this beer is dominant, good roast with hoppy bitterness taking precedent, providing a nice strike on the palate, and covering up much of the sweetness is this almost 11% ABV monster. A bit boozy in the finish, warming but also leaving a lingering bitterness then roast a bit behind. A good mesh of flavors, a little stronger on the coffee than its base styled companion. A little char/smoke/ash on the backend further in. I liked this but I think Iiked the base just a bit more as this one ends up a little overdone for me. Cheers.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3456,"2009-09-28",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 1, 2014 My Bottom Line:
Green hops and roasted cereals provide potent flavors and bitterness, somewhat alleviated by effervescent carbonation and coffee-laced oatmeal notes.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A layer of beige foam tops the blackness.
-The hoppy intensity is not necessary for this beer imho, making it stray from dessert territory.
-Alcohol heat and makes the already intense flavor profile even more brash.
-The bitterness yields some tartness in the end.
-Dextrins are well levelled.
-The hop signature is quite coniferous.
-I admit this is not what I expected to be for such a highly-rated an Imperial Stout. Its complex and very flavorful, but its so intense it can be a chore at times.
-Batches brewed at Lervig have been brighter on the coffee front and not nearly as hoppy. A luxurious dessert for sure.

Hope Ill not have to wait so long to find it again, regardless of cost.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","BeerChaser0078"

Aroma is full of coffee, beans, grinds, and fresh brewed, there are also notes of oats and grain, like porridge.  Needless to say its very rich and inviting in the nose.  This beer is very cloying at first.  The full body is so rich with tons of roasted malt, some chocolate malt, and a black patent flavor that lead into the coffee.  This beer just packs a punch with some of the best coffee notes I have tasted in beer.  Its between a dark roast and expresso in flavor, but is joined by a lightly sweet milk chocolate to balance the bitterness.   The mouth is silky smooth most likely from the oats, wtih a thin layer of carbonation apparent in the finish.  There is also a nice bitter coffee that is very strong and lingers in the finish.

Finish is not overdone on the coffee but the coffee that is there is strong. Earthy,hops also lend to the bitter,but tasteful finish. The more this opens up the more the sweet and roasty flavors exceed the alcohol and bitterness,although the alcohol in the aroma is still distracting. Also,upon opening the hops and coffee in the finish really start to blend perfectly. This would be a horrible beer to start off drinking cold as it gets better the longer it sets and I started it at room temp.

3456,"2009-08-27",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 19, 2010 THOUGHTS: I figured this would be good, but in the back of my mind I looked forward to writing a review that said I had a beer that tasted or smelled like shit  literally. But seriously, this was a lot like Beer Geek Breakfast. I thought this was a little nicer and better balance, but both are a little overly bitter. Much coffee-like bitterness. Hid alcohol fairly well, except for the aroma. It just kept getting better the warmer it got, but it was really more of a ramped up coffee stout than a true imperial stout.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown that was opaque black in the glass with an average, light to medium brown head that quickly diminished, but left fair lacing. The aroma was pretty much only moderate to heavy strong coffee and roasted malt, along with way lighter chocolate, light alcohol and underlying dark fruit. The initial flavor was sweet and lightly bitter; while the finish was very sweet, then very bitter with a long duration. There was roasted malt, strong coffee, then bitter coffee and slight alcohol, bitter hops, and bitter chocolate too and a little dark fruit. The hops and coffee blended. Actually everything blended in perfect unison, but there wasnt enough malt to balance things completely. The medium to full body was sort of creamy with lightly fizzy carbonation and a slightly metallic lightly astringent and lightly alcoholic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

3456,"2009-08-06",4.5,"Now, how does this differ from the usual Beer Geek Brunch and just what the heck is a weasel? Tighten your girdle and wrap your mind around this: around the islands of Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi in the Indonesian Archipelagos near the Philippines, there is a little critter known as the Asian Palm Civet who loves to feast on coffee cherries. While he receives nourishment from the meat of the coffee cherry, the pit does very little for him nutritionally, so like a good little weasel, he discards of it in the most natural way possible. He poops it out. Sounds a bit crass, but why sugar-coat the truth. Those rich and rare coffee beans are harvested by workers, cleaned, roasted, and sold for a mighty hefty price. Consider the rarity, the novelty, and the fact that for whatever reasons you may like to consider, or not consider, those discarded coffee beans roast one magnificent cup of coffee coveted by coffee fanatics the world over. I havent been so fortunate as to sup on a freshly brewed cup of Weasel coffee, but instead, I get to sup on an Imperial Oatmeal Coffee Stout brewed with those very same Weasel coffee beans. Apparently, someone at Mikkeller has both a discerning palate and a wicked sense of humor.


He poured oily and viscous, resembling precious black gold with a delicate topping of brown mousse. As he slowly settles, his head clings stubbornly to the sides of my glass. Like an oil geyser erupting in a ceremonial mess, his nose practically explodes in my face, smothering my senses in rich coffee and espresso esters. Should I drown at this very instant, I would with a huge grin on my face and nary a regret in my heart. Freshly drawn espresso in all his rich oily, earthy glory is topped by a thick crema which leaves a sweet burnt caramel kiss. Vanilla root and licorice offer a hearty platform upon which his river of coffee flows. Her soft edges give way to a creamy rush of aromas and an even softer, creamier body. For such a thick and heavy body, he is surprisingly effervescent and light. An earthy presence of top soil gets the show started, leading into rustic black cherries and warm, sticky black licorice. Burnt wood lingers on my palate with a charred essence while lace is splattered all across my quaffing path in large brown-black globules. Each quaff is rich, and full-bodied with charred oak, vanilla, spice, and an essence of rum to mingle with the burnt caramel and freshly drawn espresso. While it may sound like quite the mish-mash, he performs with expert aplomb and precision where most others would fall flat on their face. Skip the eggs benedict and mimosas, all I need for my Sunday brunch is a Mikkeller Beer Geek Brunch with Weasel.


It saddens me at times to see how far America has fallen from our original beery origins and rich history. Our founding fathers were avid beer aficionados and supporters. James Madison even proposed at one point a political position of Secretary of Beer to ensure that beer would be lovingly supported and encouraged in our new country. Of course, if that had happened, who knows if I would be sitting here today enjoying this fine offering from Mikkeller. That alone more than makes up for our exceedingly irrational conservatism towards responsibly celebrating and enjoying good beer. Next time youre not sure what to have for breakfast, forget the troublesome work of preparing all that food of which probably only half of it will get eaten and instead, pull out a nice glass, your bottle of Beer Geek Brunch with Weasel, and spend your lazy Sunday morning with its far superior and time-honored counterpart.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

3456,"2009-07-31",3.3,"A tall and frothy dark brown head elevates over the massive black body. Subtle smokey dark berries try to take on the massive coffee smell with a certain success. Heavy roastiness comes across not without a considerable acidity, slightly fruity at that, but also metallic and chalky which removes nodes as far as the overall balance is concerned. The acidity and coffee flavours just do not blend all that well together. A bit brutal carbonation which carries gazy fruitiness to the rear as more coffee lingers in the long finish. Chewy, yet relatively airy body which is never syrupy with its sharpish carbonation. In fact, the palate is dry all along, almost lacking in residual sugars. Im not a big fan of sweetness, but I reckon it could add a certain extra dimension around here. Alcohol remains relatively subtle for a beer of this magnitude (though it grows up as it warms), but Im not awfully impressed with its focus nor can I be with its complexity, so I must go a bit against the grain here.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

3456,"2009-07-30",4.3,"From a 500mL Bottle.  Pours a pitch black, opaque obsidian color with a thick head of frothy tan.  Rich malty aromas of graham cracker, toasted oats, and black licorice.  Moderately roasty with a subtle, but silky smooth coffee character woven into the malt profile.  Just a kiss of minty hops and a pleasing, caramelized sugar, burned prune/raisin sweetness.  Medium bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel with a soft, silky texture - really borderline oily in nature.  Packed with flavor, but well attenuated.  Flavors start out a bit sweet, with notes of molasses, brown sugar, and dark chocolate.  Some of the minty hops begin to come out mid-palate before the coffee really takes over.  Very thick, espresso like finish with a bold coffee flavor.  Im trying my best to be skeptical of the hyped civet-coffee in this beer, but the coffee flavor is truly outstanding.  Its rich, thick, and roasty without any of the unpleasant astringency, bitterness, or boiled coffee flavors that pollute 90% of the coffee beers out there.  Points for using the coffee in an appropriate manner.  After a few sips, the coffee is pretty much the only dark flavor profile I pick up, but I can dig that.  The hops are still evident and compliment the coffee nicely.  Slightly boozy warmth in the finish.  The last remaining two inches of my bottle contained a nasty amount of gelatinous sludge that plopped unceremoniously into my glass; I could have done without that.  Otherwise, a superbly executed beer.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
3456,"2009-07-29",4.3,"500 ml bottle.  Pours black with a large frothy tan head. The aroma is dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, and fine coffee.  As we discussed at our tasting, the coffee does not dominate the nose, but instead integrates nicely with the other aromas.  The flavor is again very well balanced with nothing being overly dominant: dark roasted malts, espresso, dark chocolate, anise, vanilla, and molasses.  The finish has a dry bitterness to it.  Creamy smooth mouthfeel.  I liked Beer Geek Breakfast and this one is even better.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"

Ive recently given up on coffee imperial stouts, but Brunch Weasel it much more balanced than the likes of Jav-ha amongst others. The oatmeal also added a nice creamy body that made this so great.

Lots of roastiness and chocolate flavors to start, before it becomes pretty burnt and boozy.  This does have a very nice smooth and creamy body.  Finishes a bit fruity and astringent.

The beer was phenomenal and quite an experience, but honestly..I couldnt tell the coffee used in it was from a civet, but apparently it was so Im going with it.  Roasted coffee, alcohol, rich vanilla cream and dark chocolate dominate the nose.  Flavor seemed to echo the aroma, with coffee being the most pronouced, but there was a light sourish/tangy effect, that went with what I thought was dark chocolate chips...like a cheap bakers chocolate almost.

Imperial pint into a Duvel tulip.

How bout that...big 2-finger bready maple candy head with some muffin-like tunnels. Head retention is solid with nice lacing. Tops a milk-to-dark chocolate body that has some viscosity to it. This looks solid.

Theres some nutty booze to this deal. Austere, dry coffee is powerful but theres a milkiness to the roasted chocolate malt. Only minimal tannins from any patent in there. A little hop pine and grass counter the nutty texture.

The sensations from the nose transfer to taste - very well done. Whats added is a bit of sweet brown sugar booziness with a touch of raisins. Reminds me of an espresso with a hint of anisette. A little hot right now.

Nicely put together...silky, nutty and a little dry. However this may need some time cause the alcohol sweetness does create a little burn.

Look out for this one - it has some heft and a big bite. Sip it, dont rip it.

or, ce nest pas le cas. en bouche et au nez, on y reconnaît quelques traces de petits fruits rouges, un peu de café ici et là (mais bien peu...), beaucoup dalcool, peu de velour en bouche... du chocolat certainement. la robe est également bien mince pour une bière de cette puissance (11% quand même).

the flavor is extremely roasty as well with  the coffee playing second fiddle... it is almost bitter but not quite, not sweet but not dry. that same unexplainable savory character carries over into the flavor along with some metal, ash, wood, molasses and light coffee with a nice acidity on the finish. acidity increases as it warms and helps to cut through the oily medium body. not being sweet or cloyingly rich gives it an easy drinking feel... though.... it is missing something... a roundness to bring it all together. 8/5/7/4/16/4.0","scottsdale über alles, Arizona, USA","hellbilly"

Aroma is dark chocolate and roasty-mocha, with some nuttiness for depth.  Flavors swirl gently, a wonderful array of smooth dark chocolate, Belgian chocolate, vanilla beans, buttery coffee and toasted wood.  The palate present is just so soft despite the high ABV, aided by some pearly, rolling carbonation.  Nothing is too forward here; if anything the weasel coffee lends balance, nuttiness, and soft roasted character.  An excellent beer, a treat to drink, and worthy of searching out.

3456,"2009-05-26",4.5,"From my beer column in the paper:

BOULDER, Colo.  Staring at the inky-black ""poo brew"" in my globe glass, I hesitate before my first sip.

Like dipping toes in a pool to check the temperature, I dip my nose in the glass to take a whiff. It smells fine -- great, in fact.

My concerns quickly fade behind an orchestra of wholesome, earthy, peaty and oaty aromas with a heavy overtone of coffee.

A lot went into making the beer Im about to drink. Or, more correctly, I should say it went through a lot.

It starts with Robusta coffee berries in Southeast Asia. Once theyre ripe, civets, which are cat-sized weasels, carefully pick and eat the best and ripest berries. The flesh is digested and the beans are partially broken down by special enzymes in the civets digestive system.

After the civets relieve themselves, farmers harvest the excrement (which looks a lot like PayDay candy bars), rinse off the beans, and then roast them.

Supposedly, the civets digestive enzymes make the beans less acidic and more flavorful. The result is the most expensive coffee in the world, which goes for as much as $30 per cup -- or $100 to $400 per pound.

With that in mind, I summon the courage and take my first sip of Mikkeller Beer Geek Brunch Weasel, swishing it around in my mouth before swallowing. Its milkshake-like texture is heavy on my tongue.

A mild carbonation adds to its velvety feel.

The complex coffee flavors and aromas are unique, and they remind me of rich espresso sweetened with sugar and heavy cream, yet without the harsh bitterness.

The woodsy malt flavors and aromas are filled with notes of toffee, bread dough, light char and caramel. The grassy hops contain a curious fruity-spicy element and they provide a balanced bitterness, complementing the bitter dark chocolate note in the finish.

Meanwhile, warming alcohol soothes the throat.

I work my way down the bottle and I notice some curious aromas that Ive never experienced before in an imperial stout. I detect earth and nuts, but with a slightly pungent humus-like quality, which causes my heart to skip a beat as I wonder what ingredient contributed to that aroma.

I reassure myself that its just the coffee and its safe to drink, especially after all that rinsing, roasting and boiling.

Plus, its 10.9-percent alcohol content acts as an additional sterilizer.

Taking my final sip of the tasty, luscious elixir, I realize that at least a portion of it is taking its second journey through a digestive tract.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
3456,"2009-05-25",4.2,"Bottle.  Black pour with a thin broken dark tan head.  Interesting rich coffee aroma that is smooth and isnt overbearing with the roast component.  Some chalkiness and alcohol apparent on the nose as well, but are background to the coffee/dark chocolate notes present.  Very rich mouthfeel, a slight burst of alcohol and roast greet, followed by coffee, toasted grain, chocolate, and earthy hops.  The Alesmith poop-coffee version was more brash than this with the coffee and hops, and I like it a bit more than that, but this is a damn good brew.","Florida, USA","JMFG"

3456,"2009-05-23",4.5,"Well...Looks great in the glass, aroma onec again is not as pronounced as I would have expected, especially considering it contains the Civet coffee. Doesnt taste much stronger than the beer geek breakfast alcohol-wise which I find astonishing! Id say I prefer this style of coffee flavour as its more aromatic than acrid as in the BGbreakfast, and I suppose the abv. adds a little more sweetness which balances the coffee bitterness out. Lovely espresso notes, treacle and moscavado sugar, almost burnt sugar. Once again theres some embers, a minerality that reminds me of wet slate and peat, some background vanilla essence. This beer makes me happy and content like a massive beer-cat. However, is it worth the extra dosh? I think Id be 95% as happy with the BGbreakfast, this is an excellent special treat and had to be done, and will be done a few more times, but for the extra spend I cant see it as being justifiably different enough to convert to, but if I had to I would say I prefer it to the BGbreakfast as it suits my palate better.

3456,"2009-05-05",4.5,"Big thanks to Josh for this one. (what a great extra, right?)  I got lots of coffee (of course) and a little bit of chocolate in both the aroma and the taste on this one.  Compared to other coffee beers Ive had though, this one finished a lot smoother. Often you get an almost astringent finish on coffee-brewed beers, but that was completely absent here.  A really tasty beer.  Too bad its made of weasel-poop.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Tweety"

3456,"2009-05-04",4.4,"A solid dark brown body with foamy light brown head.  An amazing toasted malt aroma with a little hop bite in there.  A faint coffee hint in the aroma.  Nothing really dominates here - just a well balanced imperial stout.  A smooth mouthfeel with a mild hoppy bite.  A little bit of chocolate and a lactic character in the body.  A vaguely dry character with a faint coffee aftertaste.  Mikkeller and Nøgne Ø continue to crank out the only cult stouts that actually live up to the hype!","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
3456,"2009-05-03",4.5,"550ml bottle - $12.99 at Bullocks Wine & Spirits

Appearance: Pours out a jet black body with a frothy, tan-hued head of considerable size.

Smell: Darkened malts with face-aimed roundhouse kicks of roast and even mercilessly charred barley -- plus all the notes later mentioned in the taste. Pleasant coffee concentrate scent thats an absolute joy to smell.

Taste: Instantly, a strong, roasty coffee flavor hits the tongue without any remorse and even lasts well beyond the finish. Abundant, amply sweet tastes of melted dark chocolate morsels, blackstrap molasses, anise, scalded heavy cream, vanilla, and even a goodly-sized pinch of Mac Baren vintage Syrian tobacco join the fray. Flavors of dark fruits and stewed licorice deftly slide into the taste. Some warming, peppery alcohol hints. Bitterish blend of creosote and pine needles, along with all the roast provides more than enough balance to all the supple, chewy maltiness. Finishes rather roasty with a lingering bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium carbonation. Fairly smooth mouthfeel.

Drinkability: Though pricey, its still a beer I wholly recommend, provided you enjoy hefty stouts and coffee. In terms of stouts, Mikkeller is now 2 for 4 with me. I didnt really care for either Black or Black Hole, but Beer Geek Breakfast was a real treat. Beer Geek Brunch is a beer to thoughtfully sip and savor, maybe while watching an episode of ""House"", though its hard not to just gulp it down with much aplomb. The 500ml emptied despairingly quickly.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

The flavor is full of coffee, completely in your face. Other flavors include chocolate, a burnt malt flavor and a hint of dark fruit. The mouthfeel is some of the thickest Ive ever experienced, almost chunky really but is creamy at the same time. Damn good beer, though a little too spendy.

Having sat on this for a while I felt like rating #1050 was as good a time as any to crack open a world class imperial stout.  At $15.99 I was not going to just pop it open for the heck of it.  I was not disappointed; in fact I almost wish I had another bottle.  If it werent for the huge backlog of Top 200ish beers to sample Id buy another tomorrow.

Aroma / Appearance - Thick and creamy the oily fluid soaks up every ounce of light.  A deep khaki head graced the top like a sheet of thick icing on a dark cupcake.  Roasted expresso, licorice, coffee, bakers chocolate, smoke, and maple syrup kept alternating in a thick cloud that could have been admired for days.

Flavor / Palate - Warming the mouthfeel fills every crevice with a full combination of coffee, rich thick creamy chocolate, anise, and liquid fudge.  The plum aftertaste marks the beer that leaves a definite impression on the senses.  Also present is a dry smoke like the bottom of a cool fire.  Overall this has no flaws and should rank right up there with other excellent imperial stouts such as Dark Lord and Darkness.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
3456,"2009-04-28",4.5,"I finally got my hands on a few bottles of this very interesting beer and it just happens to be rating number 1,400.   It poured a very glossy black with a small brown head with big bubbles that quickly faded leaving a greasy lacing on the glass. The nose is coffee, ripe fruit, and alcohol.  It sort of takes your breath away.   The mouthfeel is thick and oily, but very smooth.  The flavor is rich malts with some hops and of course that trademark civet droppings for that coffee flavor. The finish is long and bitter and alcoholic.   This is a remarkable beer if you like really rich imperial stouts.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"

Aroma is a whirlwind of venison jerky, chocolate biscuits (in the British sense), blackberries, kosher red wine. Chocolate, port and smokey charcoal flavor. Sweet enough to leave a sticky film on my teeth, almost enough tarry roast to offset the sugar. There is a lot of bluster and noise to this beer, but no poetry.","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"
3456,"2009-04-27",4.5,"1pt .9fl oz bottle. Pours a lighter shade of black body with a thin, fizzy, brown head that dissipates immediately. Leaves the surface looking like a whispy, cirrus cloud. The lacing on the glass is a lovely and delicate waterfall of oily brown. The aroma is straight weasel poo...seriously...The coffee is noticeable, but is more acidic than most coffee stouts. It doesnt really jump out at me like I was expecting, but rather accompanies the rest of the aromas nicely. A soft roast, sharp berries, acidic citrus, and a light astringent booze make up the majority of the remaining aromas. Some rich chocolates and dry wood find room in here as well. The flavor is right up my alley. Starts out with loads of chocolate and malts. Moves into some citrus, berries, and light acidic coffees before exploding in the finish. The citrusy hops really jump out at the end along with a light burnt roast and mild coffee. Stays somewhat acidic and dry. The booze creeps its way in during the finish as well and has a nice warmth on the way down. Lots of hops in the aftertaste along with tons of chocolate. Palate is medium bodied and extremely silky. Loaded with flavors, but really glides through the palate. Overall, a fantastic beer. The coffee works with the rest of the beer rather than the rest of the beer trying to catch up with the coffee. Excellent balance and palate. One of my new all-time faves!","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
3456,"2009-04-26",4.3,"3/18/2009:  Beer Geek Brunch Weasel Poop has a rich, deeply roasty aroma.  It does not overtly scream ""coffee"" which is good.  There is just a mere hint to whet the appetite.  The flavor is moderately dry and complex.  It has a deep roastiness and a great mocha characteristic. It is very rich and smooth paired with an equally rich and creamy mouthfeel.  This is a great coffee beer.  The coffee is there, but it doesnt dominate.  Thats the way it should be.  The other flavors are well-integrated and I really like the dark chocolate dimension.  JCW says ""Good shit!"" and I completely agree!

Aroma is dark chocolate/black patent malt with strong notes of espresso.
Flavor is Dark Imperial Stout, with the oatmeal smoothing it down, some coffee/espresso notes, acidity is fairly low which is a good thing.
Mouthfeel is thick, viscous yet smooth. Initially it is a little on the sweet side but heads towards being a little more dry on the finish. Its like drinking velvet.
Overall: The big imperial oatmeal stout flavors combine with a very nice espresso/coffee kick that is lower in acid than many other imperial stouts that have coffee in them. Very nice!","Arizona, USA","ragesaq"

Mouth is really full and thick, a bit grainy too. An excellent beer, not sure if it is any better then the Beer Geek Breakfast but still excellent.

Some tar and pine sap are behind.  Was this supposed to be hoppy?  Letting it warm up a little bit I can get the oatmeal and some dark chocolate.  I go into these highly rated beers wanted to hate them, but damn, so far this is great.  The flavor adds the right amount of alcohol and a little soy, but otherwise, much the same--there may be a little bit of smokiness, but I wouldnt go as far to say campfire.

Aroma is a complex roasty, chocolatey, nougat-like medley. Theres also an odd, indescribable funky component in there too, though not necessarily a flaw.

On the palate the thick, syrupy body pleases quite well, and canvasses the palate with rich roasty flavors, espresso & espresso crema, and finishes with a pleasant bitterness that is found in the best of espressos.

I couldnt resist poking, leaving a finger sized crater which held form and took quite some time to dissipate.  Once it finally did, the head collapsed, leaving nice sticky lacing. The aroma started off with the typical cocoa, roasted malt, and coffee. As it warmed, the nose exploded, showing off more anise, dark fruit, and tobacco. The taste is definately unique and more complex as it approaches room temperature.  Flavor is heavy in dark chocolate and roasted malt, hints of molasses and tar, and the overall presence of a finely made espresso.

Slightly cloying in the long run, but nothing serious. Tart roasted finish with a smooth, mild bitterness. Lingering apple notes and alcohol. As it warms, it develops coffee notes, a slightly candy-like sweetness and a dry off-note. Smooth palate, although a tad too much carbonation for my taste.

Finishes with a hint of smoke, some licorice bite, molasses twang and has an overall dark fruit presence. The mouth feel is creamy and lush, medium to full-bodied with an metallic finish, some boozy warming noted but not distracting.

3456,"2009-04-14",4.2,"Bottle in trade from ROBORB.  Thanks for hooking me up with this!  Pours dark black with a medium lived tan head.  Smell is oatmeal, chocolate and somewhat acidic coffee.  Taste is bittersweet with lots of chocolate and oatmeal creaminess and lightly tart coffee and licorice.   Nice bitterness, and the coffee presence is there, but not super strong.  The coffee flavor has a slightly different and lightly tart/acidic quality about it that while still was tasty, I didnt particularly want as much of as I got.  Like trying to drink down melted marshmallows, this is thick and chewy, just like I like it. Body and mouthfeel is perfectly rich with soft but suitable carbonation.  Overall a very tasty beer that, in the end, Im glad I tried as it did seem a bit different than the regular Beer Geek.  I definitely prefer the mouthfeel of this, and the flavor of both were almost equal to me with the regular possibly prevailing with less acidity, as I remember it.  The oatmeal creaminess played a more noticeable role in it to me than any sort of specialty coffee bean flavor however.

Full palate and the flavour starts in right away.Lots of coffee taste, good coffee made in a frnech press at the right temp. Some roasted malt in there, and a bit more chocolate, but not sweet this time. Leaves a semi bitter flavour that is not hoppy at all. This is pretty enjoyable and pretty easy to drink for a big stout.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"

Very little light passes through even at the edges. large, dark tan head.Coffee is big in this one, perhaps overpowering the rest of the beer. A bit of licorice underneath the coffee.  Very low sweetness for the size and style and a small hint of soy sauce.

Coffee, caramel, vanilla, and hints of citrus and warming alcohol are all present.  A full, CREAMY body.  Plenty of creamy, sweet caramel and chocolate start things off taste-wise.  A BIG coffee bitterness follows.  This beer has stronger coffee qualities than just about any other Ive tried.  Finishes with some resiny tongue-stripping grapefruitiness.  A very dry finish that lingers.  Hints of warming alcohol throughout.   Who woulda thunk weasel feces would taste so damn good?","Washington DC, USA","lamas"
3456,"2009-04-11",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2009 Bottle from Nqualls. Thanks Nathan. Pours deep brown/black  half finger dissipating chocolate brown head, along with small, tight carbonation bubbles that stick to the glass. Aroma is very nice. Out of the fridge you get strong amounts of sweet dark chocolate and espresso, but as it warms, coffee grounds and roast enter the mix. This is full bodied with a thick creamy mouthfeel that creates soft carbonation. Initial flavor of molasses and plums, with accents of unsweetened bitter chocolate and vanilla. Mid palate smacks you with a sharp espresso bitterness that carries through to the dry and slightly balsamic vinegary finish. The roast and vinegar really sticks and lingers at the back of the mouth. Alcohol hidden very well.This gets much better approach room temp. This is not a terrible beer, but very unbalanced and approaches acridity at certain points. Not a Top 50 in my book. I am glad I tried it.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"
3456,"2009-04-11",4.2,"Pours black with a small tan head that recedes quickly. Very strong aroma of coffee, roasted malt, and ash. Taste is dark chocolate, tar, ash, citrus hops, and coffee plus some alcohol - my nose tingles with every sip. Smooth bitter finish of hops and roasted malt. The after taste is long and outstanding, full of coffee and cola - definitely the best part of this beer. I can savor this for several minuets before taking another sip. Surprisingly light palate, with a little more carbonation than I would like for an impy stout - at first. It fizzes and expands in the mouth for the first few sips, but then the carbonation dies down to reveal a smoother, creamier palate. Very good, flavorful beer. Im glad I tried it, but considering the price tag, Id say there are better beers out there - beers not made of shit.","Maryland, USA","NomDeBeer"
3456,"2009-04-11",4.7,"Bottle; cellared a few months. Beautiful pour: a short lived thick chocolatey head atop a dark obsidian body. Redolent of chocolate and coffee, oak, some cola, licorice, dark fruits, and subtle citric hints that are reinforced by the alcohol. Flavor is roasted coffee with dark chocolate undertones, creamy milk chocolate, cola, vanilla, oak, at this point the bitterness basically obliterates the sweetness, then the alcohol kicks in and cleans it off the palate leaving chocolate and dark fruit flavors atop the tongue punctuated by an oaky sweetness. The palate is really smooth but very light for an Imperial Stout, somewhat surprisingly so in fact. Superb craftsmanship and a fantastic beer.","Glenside, Pennsylvania, USA","Jsawyer"

3456,"2009-04-09",4.7,"Bottle. Finally Ive got the bottles I ordered a month ago or so through Systembolagets ""private import"". Expensive stuff, but with all the hype around this brew it was hard to resist. Pours an absolutely black color with a nice brown head, which fades away after a while, leaving some lacing. Aroma is inviting with coffee, dark chocolate, some burnt notes, and behind this some citrus hops and fruits. I must say that I wasnt 100% convinced with the the smell at first, it came out as a bit anonymous but still very good. I was, of course, extremely curious about the taste so I didnt use that much time to smell. First sip was... wow! What a powerful taste. Theres lots of hard roasted coffee notes, with nice amounts of really dark chocolate, and a big bitterness. Very dry beer overall, which Ive started to like more and more recently. Its some light milk chocolate sweetness behind all this which balances well with the other flavours. Some light acidity (in a good way) is also there together with citrus-tasting hops, liquorice, smoke and tar. Wonderful velvety smooth palate, really thick, creamy, oily and fullbodied (almost the best about this beer, Ive never tasted anything which is as filling as this). Overall just an amazing beer, one of the best Ive had. I just want another sip, and another, and another...

A: Pours a very deep dark black hue. The head is 1/4 finger in height, very fizzy and of a shade of mocha. It quickly dies to a cap with some areas thicker than others. No lace noted.

S: Fairly acidic aromas come from the glass. Over cooked coffee with notes of rich bitter chocolate rule here. Subtle notes of dark fruit peek through.

T: Another espresso lovers beer. Very bold over roasted espresso up front. Notes of rich dark chocolate in the middle. Very acidic this one bites at the tongue. A very light creamy note which does not stand up at all to the coffee. Subtle sour red berries in the finish. I really like this one.

M: Only medium in body, very acidic, this one bites at the mouth, tongue, and throat.

Green hops mix with gooey thick malt and molasses in the aromas. Some extra dark chocolate also in the mix. Big, thick and chewy feel in the front, but it thins out quite a bit by the end. Acidic from the start. With lightly charred coffee and ripe berries that follow. Some major chunks come out in subsequent pours. Coffee nuances pick up with the further pours as well. A liqueur character starts to come into play. Pine and licorice flavors appear in the middle. Finish and linger have a bit of tar and espresso.

Head is initially average sized, fizzy/frothy, brown, fully diminishing.
Body is opaque black (flashlight tested).

Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain/coffee, dark chocolate), lightly hoppy (grapefruit, resin), with notes of alcohol and vanilla, hints of bile and chalk.

Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately to heavily bitter.

Medium to full body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic, lightly to moderately astringent.

Surprisingly ho-hum.  Pretty ordinary stout aroma, the usual suspects.  The coffee component is pleasant but no better than your average coffee stout.  Some hint in the aroma that the acidity would be strong, faint whiff of stomach acid in the background.  A bit rough in the mouth experience...lotsa alcohol, aggressive bitterness and acidity, and an ample amount of astringency as well.

Not much of toast here, and very balanced. Far from being aggressive. Body is thick malty, without being sticky, as always with Mikkeller. The bottle conditioning might give some extra smoothness to body, whereas the carbonation level is pretty low. Flavour is very balanced, there is a silky, chocolatey mouthcoating backbone with segments of that poo coffee, that is well integrated with the chocolate malts. A clear violet touch is also present.

Pours a thick, heavy opaque black; minimal, tight dark tan head.
Aroma dominated by fresh black coffee and heavy roasted grains.  Coffee aroma is very strong and pronounced, without much in the way of cocoa or creamy notes that often appear.
Flavor opens up some more dimensions, though still very much coffee-forward.  Coffee flavor follows the nose- dark, sharp, and aggressive.  Some hop bite blends in well with the coffee sharpness.  Some notes of dark sweet molasses, thick oatmeal, and dark bakers chocolate round out the flavor.
Palate is full and heavy, carries the alcohol well in a solid, big stout.

3456,"2009-03-29",3.7,"Bottle from the Orland Park, IL, Binnys:  This glops out of the bottle as a thick, dark brown liquid.  It did turn black in the glass, topped, albeit breifly, by a chocolate colored head.  It had aroma of coffee that was pooped out of small mammal butts.  (Actually, that was my second guess.  Rather than Vietnamese ca phe chon coffee, I thought it might have been Tasters Choice.)  Actually, it smelled of dark coffee and pungent nuts, anise, burnt brown sugar, bakers chocolate, roasted malt, and a whiff of cigar smoke.  The mouthfeel began with an oatmeal creaminess but developed an astringent side by the third or fourth taste.  By the end of the bottle, it was downright bothersome.  The flavor was accurately reflective of the aroma, save that the alcohol made its presence known and there was a small mammal butt bitterness at the end.  Okay, okay.  Scratch the weasels butt.  It was actually more of a charred wood bitterness.  Not a bad drink over all, but I was raised on less pretentious coffee.","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
3456,"2009-03-29",4.2,"thick beer which pours out black-hole black with a very fine layer of tiny tan bubbles. when i imagine drinking coffee brewed with beans that were pooped out of some small mammals ass, there are no constraints on flavor or aroma, and this stout doesnt disappoint.  full of coffee and vanilla, and cascade-like hops aroma, and licorice and brown sugar.  less roasted barley than i expected, but the coffee supplements the roast and burnt elements.  green and alcoholic in the end.  flavor is more strongly coffee-flavored than the aroma, and flavors blend very well. excellent stout on its own, and i dont think that it needs the gimmicky price tag, which reflects the difficulty of procuring coffee beans out of some little weasels turds.  seems like coffee that doesnt involve musteline spoors from the asian jungles would work just as well, and might bring the price down to a point where i would drink this beer again.  that said, its a great beer, if a little boozy.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"

3456,"2009-03-28",4.4,"I figured drinking this for my 200th is a solid choice.  Pours black into snifter with a large beige head.  Aroma is weasel poo consisting of a carnivorous mixture of mice, rabbits, gophers,  chipmunks and the ocassional coffee bean (had to do it).  No this brew has a STRONG coffee, smokey, and chocolate aroma.  Might be one of the strongest coffee aromas out there in a beer, (maybe peche mortal compares?) Flavor is great, at first I thought it might be too strong for the flavor profile but there is a nice hop and malt backbone to make it quite enjoyable.  Not as much coffee in the flavor as you would think by the aroma.  The hops surprised me the most such a solid addition to the typical smoky malt and chocolate malt profile.  Finish is slightly dry and slightly bitter.  A thoughly enjoyable beer.  
Oh yeah in case you wondered if more is coming I found this at the Mikkeller website:

""It is not unproblematic to get your hands on sufficient amounts of the rare and very expensive weasel pooh coffee. But now it seems that a delivery is underway. A Vietnamese coffee plantation owner has promised to deliver the coffee immediately. He reports that on his plantation no weasels go to bed hungry . Every morning he gets out of bed when the dawn is still cracking only to collect the precious pooh. Very soon all the pooh will be send to Nøgen Ø (Naked Island) in Norway where Mikkel will brew the next batch of Beer Geek Brunch in the middle of April""

Deep, roasty coffee flavor - I can really tell this would be very, very good coffee - but it doesnt overwhelm the rest of whats in here... dark chocolate, very dark brown sugar, and oak.

Immediately strong taste of great rich coffee, with the oatmeal and chocolate coming later, and mixing very smoothly with the coffee flavor.

Pours and oily pitch black with a soft-textured tan head that sticks well to the snifter. Aroma is a pleasing aroma of dark chocolates and coffee bean. The coffee character in the nose is not overdone however, but pretty well balanced with the dry and smoky roasted malt. Nose became a bit metallic after sitting for a couple of minutes, losing some points. Nice flavors of cocoa powder and more coffee follow up, with a dry chocolate and smoke character throughout. Palate is what kept my points up here; very smooth and silky on the back of the tongue. For some reason the palate reminds me of that of Amager Hr. Frederiksen. Roasty, medium-length finish.

The aroma was not nearly as intense as I was expecting with understated notes of dark chocolate, vanilla, and roasted coffee beans.

Coffee and bitter chocolate linger on the palate rounding out the experience.  This beer is also extremely silky and smooth on the palate, with only a hint of alcoholic burn.  A fine effort, although there are other coffee stouts I prefer.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","DMRz"
3456,"2009-03-13",4.1,"This beer lived up to the hype. Aroma was so so. The usual mix of dark chocolate and coffee. Pour was perfect. A deep dark black with a pillowy dark tan head of about 2 fingers sitting on top. Taste was full, thick and chewy. The coffee flavor in this beer was amazing. Strong and bitter with the dark chocolate battling for dominance. Great carbonation for an impy and a delicious chocolatey thick aftertaste.

3456,"2009-03-13",4.1,"Pouring an opaque, inky, pitch black, the body is crowned with a thick, lasting head of light brown foam.  Showing some viscosity upon a swirl of the glass, a sheety wash slowly meanders back towards the surface, leaving sticky, jagged ribbons of lacing behind.  It looks like a menacing, serious imperial stout, considerably heavier than the Beer Geek Breakfast.  Rich and fully roasty, the nose shows massive coffee character, with freshly roasted dark beans clearly being the primary focus.  Bitter dark cacao and carefully burnt caramel provide ample malt backbone to stand up to the huge coffee roast.  The flavor is smooth and well blended, coffee and earthen hops pushing it to the brink of intense bitterness before the choco-caramel sweetness pulls it just back over the edge.  There are hints of anise and perhaps some deeply buried dark fruit, but this one is all about bitter roast and chocolate.  The mouthfeel is big, almost full in fact, finishing dry and roasty.  This is a mighty fine beer.  Not top 50 material, in my opinion, but a delicious coffee imperial nonetheless.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Pours pitch with a dark brown head, rocky and aggressive with good legs, looks, as the other Michael says, ""like mousse on the top.""  Taste is too-raw alcohol and espresso dumped into a thick, full chocolate stout, but one which lacks the roasty notes and general rounded harmony of the best of the best.

3456,"2009-03-01",4.0,"The head that you get at first is dark tan and fades slowly but not before creating an interesting lattice work structure that is fun to watch dissipate.  The aroma is pretty incredible too and dominated by roasted chocolate and bitter coffee. The flavor is mostly a smooth roast coffee flavor with some chocolate notes dancing in the background. The bitterness is a little much and  the hops probably could have been toned down a bit. The finish is pretty much a grassy hop flavor.  Full bodied and a great straight forward impy stout.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"

It has a timid aroma that seems to be hiding away in my glass and giving just glimpses of roasted malts, molasses and chocolate malts. It quickly becomes impossible to smell anything out of this beer. The taste is no where near timid with rich sweet maltiness, velvety chocolate and molasses all coming together nicely. Nearing midway caramel shows up with solid coffee notes in tow to join in with the chocolate, roasted malts and molasses.

Aroma is hellishly dark coffee and burnt dark chocolate.  Flavors of the same, plus an interesting anise interaction.  A little under-spiced for me, and rather lacking on the oatiness.  Still, quite dark, quite smooth, and exceptionally relaxing fare for an evening in front of the terra cotta oven.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"

Not special though.  Chewy body an silky mouthfeel.  I look at the score that Im giving this beer and it doesnt really fit with my comments.

3456,"2009-02-21",4.6,"1pt .9oz bottle poured into a snifter.

The pour is gorgeous with a huge fluffy tan head on top of a pitch black body.  The head lingers as a big cap for the duration and leaves tons of lacing.

The aroma is massive with dominant smells of dark sweet malts and roasted coffee.  Neither dominates the other and make for an extremely well balanced nose.

I have to admit to being slightly biased as I love coffee infused beers, but, damn, the taste is extraordinary.  Its got the roasted coffee playing a prominent role but there is none of the bitterness that often goes along with it.  The sweet dark malts form a great backbone with some chocolate and licorice.  Hints of smoke linger in the finish along with a perfect coffee aftertaste.

The mouthfeel is nothing short of perfection.  Good carbonation combined with a heavier body produces the ideal velvety finish that you strive for.

Well, this just blew me away.  The look and aroma were pretty darn good, but after the first sip, I was hooked.  This is a truly exceptional beer - a perfectly balanced coffee stout.  Go get this now.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

3456,"2009-02-14",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 11, 2010 (Bottled) Very dark brown with a small to medium, beige head. Quite delicious aroma with lots of smooth coffee, licorice-roasty malt, and aromatic, American-style hops. Strong and intense, but smooth coffee flavor with lots of roasted malt, some licorice, aromatic hops, milky sourness, and some burned hints in the finish. Hides the ABV completely. Medium to full, velvety-smooth body with low carbonation. An ultra-smooth, yet not too tamed Imperial Stout, a classic. The next 2 bottles were a bit harsh and burned, so dropping the score 4.5 -> 4.2.","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"

3456,"2009-02-09",4.3,"A pretty careful pour still produces a fat, four-finger thick, darkly browned head in my 25cl tulip glass.  The beer is quite black in color and is opaque even when held up directly to the light.  The aroma smells of darkly roasted grain, wholesome roasted coffee and dark chocolate.  Despite being so roast focused the aroma is quite smooth smelling; it seems to be missing the acrid, sharp burnt notes and charcoal like acidity that plagues many a heavily roasted beer.  Instead the aroma is just rich and quite enjoyable; ample aromas of toasted whole grain bread, roasted berry coffee notes, roasty / toasty whole grain crackers, blackened brown sugar coffee notes and lots of dark, sweet, complex malt character.

Nice and creamy feeling as it first hits the tongue, this beer is fairly viscous, but does have an ample carbonation that contributes a bit more prickly texture than I would prefer; this is easily remedied with some vigorous swirling of my glass.  This beer just tastes incredibly rich and decadent; up front lots of rich cocoa flavors combine with caramelized roast malt notes.  The coffee accentuates a darkly roasted, but not burnt, bright berry flavor here.  It also couples with the dark grain to produce a burnt bitterness in the finish as well as a roast acidity that provides a touch of needed balance to the sweet, chewy malt rather than being harsh.  This beer has such a chewy, dense, rich body to it, it definitely has a syrup like viscosity to it as it rolls across the tongue and clings to the palate.  This beer hides its alcohol extremely well; it is just such a smooth drinking experience.  The roast character can be a touch smoky at times with perhaps a touch of savor, almost salty character to it at times (though it is clearly dominated by the complex malt sugars).

This beer has been quite a nice surprise, I really wasnt expecting this beer to be so smooth and well integrated when I popped the cap; this keeps the typical harsh, bitterly burnt and astringent roast character of both the dark malt and the coffee well in check, and there is a ton of chewy malt character that easily balances what is here.  I almost feel like I should be more critical of this beer than I am, but it is just so tasty, and quite the great experience; if it wasnt fifteen bucks a bottle I would be buying a bunch of this for my beer-fridge; by which I mean drink this now, despite the ample alcohol, I dont see this getting a whole lot better, it is perfect fresh, and I have a feeling any significant age will just make this more unbalanced (though it should still be quite tasty for years to come).

3456,"2009-02-06",4.6,"UPDATED: FEB 7, 2009 Bottle from West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago.   Im not usually in the habit of ingesting something made from something that has previously been ingested by another animal, but if its expensive it must be good.  Pours a viscous very dark opaque brown with a fine fizzy khaki colored head, looks similar to Black Albert.  Very rich strong aroma, a bit of acidity in the coffee, vanilla from the creamy rich oatmeal, super dark high-cocoa chocolate, some decadent dark fruits, smells gritty and chalky.  The aroma is actually quite complex and not really centered on the coffee.  Very tasty, extreme flavor, super dark and bitter, light sugary sweetness,  a bit of dark fruits at first but quickly gets overwhelmed by the coffee, dark bitter-sweet chocolate, lots of acidity from the coffee with just a hint of licorice in the finish.  Really gains complexity as it reaches room temp.  Really long super bitter dark chocolate coffee aftertaste.   Medium bodied with a full mouthful, a bit syrupy and lightly sticky, lots of fine tiny sizzling carbonation that makes the beer feel a bit gritty and fluffy.   A fantastic beer, a complete package. The light fruitiness accenting the dark bitter chocolate and coffee is very decadent.  [So much better at room temp... no stickiness, much fruitier, draws many comparisons to Black Albert]","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"
3456,"2009-02-03",4.8,"Celebrating my #500 of the Stouties. It is black, pitch black and the head is dark brown, creamy and lasting. The aroma has notes of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, licorice and oats  it is incredibly harmonic and extremely inviting. The mouthfeel is fat and nice. The flavour, woow, have I gone to heaven, I must have? It has a light sweetness from the smooth, mellow, perfect amount of oats, and it has a nice present and yet subdued and nicely balanced bitterness, it has notes of coffee, dark and delicious chocolate, licorice and the finish is dry. Just like the Beer Geek Breakfast it is so incredibly clean, strong and very well balanced in all notes. It is incredibly nice, harmonic and irresistibly nice, hmm, I guess I do not have to explain, that Im in love with this beer...","Thisted, DENMARK","Maria"
3456,"2009-02-02",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 11, 2009 Bottle, from Julios drunk on 2.2.09.  A dark robe with a frail, receding tan head and plenty of sediment left at the bottom of the bottle.Prunes and espresso-like notes, nice and oily, waft gently from the glass.  A warm, rather inviting shot of ethanol emerges with warming and breathing.  Surprisingly, there is almost no noticeable banana or cotton candy to the nose, which is impressive, being from a young bottle.  In the mouth, the pruniness and bittersweet roast notes lend momentum to the emerging roll of sweet, milk chocolate-like maltiness and obvious alcohol warmth on the finish.  The residual sugars are very persistent (and in my mind, too excessive) and lightly fatigue the palate in to tasting only this dominant flavor, over the course of the beer (three of us split the bottle).  Interesting notes of fudge, sweet almond and oily, bittersweet coffee beans, and I cant admit to being terribly offended by the alcohol appearance, being quite light for this young and high abv of a beer.  Good stuff, hopefully some more complexity will develop with age.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The aroma was COFFEE, and lots of it.  Notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt and oats were present.  The flavor kicked me in the face.  The base was a solid roasted malt, with chocolate, oatmeal and molasses.  The coffee was present, but not over the top like I might have expected.  The palate was amazing, with soft carbonation, a full body and a creamy, smooth mouthfeel.

3456,"2009-01-19",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2014 Pitch black with a small, light brown head. The aroma has a lot of coffee with American hops, and a little bready malt, dark chocolate and oatmeal. While I?m not a fan of coffee beer aromas in general, this one at least doesn?t remind me of cold espresso and ashtrays. The flavour is huge, and very sweet. The base is clearly a big stout, with sweet licorice dominating on top of bitter chocolate, grains and malt, molasses and charcoal. The coffee flavour is quite pleasant and rich, and cascade-like hop flavour is noticed. The oatmeal makes a huge impact, both with a biscuit note, and a huge body, with a velvet mouthfeel.The downside, and its important, is raw, hot alcohol, and too much sugary sweetness.","Odense, DENMARK","Christian"

Pours utterly black with a fine, creamy, deep-brown head. Fizzes quite a lot, but still stays for quite some time. Absolutely wonderful aroma, extremely powerful.

Wow, what a beer! There is so much, yet it is so incredibly balanced. Lots of coffee, though never getting bitter. Some fatness and sweetness from the oats. Lots of roasted, dry malts. Dark, sweet chocolate. Just warming, never alcoholic. Fruity and flowery hops abound. Sweet aftertaste at first, then lots of coffee dryness peep through. Holy crap... this is utterly deserved.

The roasted malt and coffee are doing most of the job though. It’s smooth in the mouth, oily, full-bodied and slightly warming, with a big flavor of coffee, roasted malts and dark chocolate. Fine hoppy fruityness too. Both hoppy bitterness and most of all coffee-like bitterness. Everlasting finish with a wonderful bitterness to support the flavors found initially. My girlfriend loves coffee, I don’t. With this beer it’s opposite, and I loved it. It’s not an easy-to-drink beer, but damn delicious if you’re ready to hold on to your glass for an hour.
