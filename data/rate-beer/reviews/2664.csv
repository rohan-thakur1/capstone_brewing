2664,"2017-06-07",4.0,"Bottled on 10/14/15. Served from 22oz bottle into glass at home. Pours deep amber red in color, medium high clarity, with a tan colored head. The head quickly diminishes to a a thin ring of bubbles on the glass. Legs visible when agitated. Assertive aroma, sweet caramel malt and lots of alcohol, resulting in a preserved fruit character. Some fruitiness that may be alcoholic esters or hops. Flavor is more malt with lots of alcohol and high hoppy bitterness. The body is full, almost chewy, medium low carbonation with a decidedly dry finish. Even with all the alcohol aroma and flavor there is little heat detectable at the finish. Overall this beer lacks the hop character expected, but that is most likely due to the age of the bottle. It comes off as an aggressively bitter American barleywine and really is an amped-up version of the original.","Wisconsin, USA","handmuffin"

I was drinking with ratebeer scholar Helsdon -- hey man, we should grab a beer! -- at the Indie Ale House in the Junction & he was marvelling at how the beer was swallowing our taste buds, like a greedy black hole. (Every beer we sampled after this was damaged by the liver bile remnants of the bastard). This version adds to that deep, dark taste bud erosion experience. Big suckerpunch of sugared malts to the mouth, with a deep & rich cough syrup hop bitterness beneath the sweetness. The booze is sloppy & heavy & embarrassing, like a drunk step-mother falling down the stairs during a family get together. Hard to love this. Hard to ignore it.

(In fact, not sure why Ive ended up with another bottle o Double Bastard, having sworn it off at least twice before. Fuck it. Ill just blame Trump.) Anyway, the pours decent, the nose warns you of the massive malt-hop avalanche to come, but nothing really prepares you for that one-two punch of sweet toffee-caramel mixed with pure pinecone resin hops. Deep dark veins of brown sugar, maybe even a hint of white chocolate, followed by a little dried apricot, then on to the sweet, boozy, IBU-packed finish. I get why people dig this beer.

Flavors arrive similarly with dark fruits leading; caramel & hops following behind. Actually finishes with an peppery, chalky bitterness along with booze. And that finish is the part where it falls off. Its got that medicinal (Theraflu) bitterness. Aftertaste is harsh & uninviting, much like Arrogant Bastard. Warms up with less bitterness but also becomes much more astringent & solvent-like with booze.

Appearance small foam, small bubbles, creamy, long lasted. Dark amber, almost brown, a little bit cloudy. Nice.
Aroma: Nice! Rich palate of malts: grains, biscuits, caramel (raisins, muscavido, roasted sweet bread). Pleasent red fruits: apple and grapes. Some grassy/herbal notes. Alcohol is present, but its acceptable.
Taste: At the beginning very sweet, malty with hints of fruit. After second appears some strange, grassy, phenolic and taninn note. Herbal, spicy, acrid. It was really strange, but overall rather unpleasent - like beer fermented in too high temperature. Alcohol is present, nicely warms up throat.
Mouthfeel and bitterness: rather high bitterness. I feel phenols and alcohol present, making it long and sharp. Texture is oily, rich, thick, nicely pours in mouth.

I waffled a little scoring this one. The flavours (particularly the hops) are somewhat overshadowed by the massive maltiness and ABV, so its not simply Arrogant Bastard times two - the balance and interplay of flavours are completely different. (Thats not to denigrate the value of a boozy big bastard, mind you.) However, the other factor here is that a lot of the complexity and depth of flavour - and theres a lot - is overshadowed by the big malt and ABV, so to some extent it doesnt completely succeed, even on its own terms. When I first reviewed this, I opined that it might benefit from a greater hop presence, but even in a relatively fresh example, the hops are massively overshadowed by the the malt and alcohol. Still, for all that, its lots of fun and actually a darn sight better than the Depth-Charged version I tried recently. (18/20)","CANADA","UXO"

2664,"2015-01-13",4.3,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter. A - Woah! Big aromas in this beer. Smells very floral and boozy. Plenty of hop bitterness present as well A - Deep amber hue--just a tad darker than the standard ABA. The lightly tanned head receded down to a thin layer of bubbles that hung out atop the brew throughout the drink. T - The attack features an array of floral notes and plenty of malty sweetness which continues through the middle of the sip. The finish features that Stone signature blast of bitter which crescendos until it comes full circle and returns to the malty and caramely sweetness. Wow. P - Such a full and rich mouthfeel. I can feel my tongue counting up the calories. The bitter finish cuts right through the richness and gives it a nice balance. O - This is a BIG beer. Very full in maltiness and extremely bitter. But it, no doubt, creates an amazing drinking experience. This beer has such large range of flavors and aromas: malty, floral, bitter, and boozy. It is extraordinarily balanced for such an intense drink. Beers this bitter may not be for everyone, but i couldnt recommend it more. This is a supreme brew.

2664,"2014-08-19",4.1,"Bottle: Thanks Hackobock: Served in a shaker:
Medium sized creamy head. Almost clear amber body.
Aroma is a delicious mix of hops, yeast, wood, toast, some fruits, some herbs deliciously balanced.
Flavour has tones of bread, toast, bitters, malts, herbs, some caramel, dried leaves, hay/grass tints and some spice/alcohol.
Aftertaste is strong bitter with malts, some caramel, herbal toast, dried leaves and hay/grass.
Low carbo, creamy mouthfeel, full bodied and a creamy sticky texture.

2664,"2014-08-16",4.3,"I poured a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass. It was dated as a 2010 release and cost $6.99 ($0.32 per ounce).

Appearance: An ugly rusty brown/brick red hue over a completely opaque body. Pours to a three-finger, ivory, frothy head which laces and retains very well.

Smell: Extremely sweet aroma of confectionery flavors and some alcohol.

Taste: Ive never been a big fan of Stones Bastard series, as I tend to find them too abrasive for their own good (except Oaked Arrogant Bastard, which is perfectly balanced). Double Bastard tends to be the beefiest of them all, not surprisingly. I set this bottle aside in the basement nearly four years ago and had forgotten about until recently. With some age on it, this beer has become quite different from the hop bomb I remember. Its very sweet, but not cloying, and is now well-balanced since the hops have faded.

If I were drinking this blind I could confuse it for a strong English-style barleywine. Huge confectionery notes are present right off the rip: toffee, caramel, peanut brittle, and butterscotch. Additional complexity through the middle with notes of red and black cherries. The hops still maintain some bitterness, but are not nearly as dry and astringent as they are fresh. Slight earthy/smoky/piney flavors through the middle with just a touch of bitterness. It finishes as it starts, but with some warming (and complementary) alcohol flavor and sensation. Overall, its a delectable beer, though not quite a mind-blower.

Drinkability: One of the reasons Im not a fan of fresh Double Bastard is because its difficult to drink it in anything bigger than a tiny sip. With four years of age under its belt, its a different world. The mouthfeel is thick, calm, soft and smooth. The alcohol is subtle and leaves a gentle warming sensation. Theres a residual aftertaste of malty sweetness and minor dry bitterness, but its easily tolerable. Even at 11.2% ABV, this is no longer a beastly brew and I can handle the entire 22oz bomber myself.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

2664,"2014-07-02",5.0,"Stones Bastard releases never fail to blow my mind. For me, Double Bastard proved to be every bit as enjoyable as the other releases that Ive, well, enjoyed (Arrogant Bastard and Oaked Arrogant Bastard). The malty caramel note that this brew starts off with is sublime. The spicy, herbal hop kick that comes after that is even better. Did I say better than sublime? I suppose that doesnt make much sense. Yet, I do indeed consider Double Bastard to be twice as good as Arrogant Bastard. Admittedly, thats a paradox. I consider Arrogant Bastard to be perfect. How can something be two times more perfect? Exactly. Infinity times two still equals infinity. Thats the nature of the Bastard series. Every beer is better than the last... even though the last one was perfect. Shit, maybe I shouldnt drink so much before I post these reviews... Anyway, Double Bastard has a gorgeous amber-red color with a lovely off-white head. Aroma has boozy sweetness, dark fruits, and pungent hops. My bomber was bottled on 9/01/2013 which meant I was a mere 2 months and 1 day away from a year-old bottle. Oh well. The hops were still plenty aggressive but a bit refined. One things for damn sure: the body was thick and the mouthfeel was warming in the best possible way. Okay, so I guess that was actually two things. Sue me. At the end of my tasting, I couldnt find any gripes with this beer. I also fully enjoyed reading the bottle notes. Any brewery that uses the word ""masturbatory"" when talking about their ale is okay by me. Double Bastard made my night by giving me balls-out flavor with a healthy dose of class. I wouldnt expect anything less than that from Stone.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

2664,"2014-06-19",4.4,"Transfer from BA reviewed on 6-3-12- 
Poured from 22 oz bomber into snifter

Appearance Pours a hazy brown mahogany color with a small off white head. The head fades fast to leave a very persistent white foam film on the top of the brew. 

Smell  A bready base aroma is mixed with huge hop aromas. There are big smells of bitter-resinous pine and citrus hop with other aromas of earthy nature. Mixed with all these are lighter fruit aromas and a good bit of alcohol aroma as well; rounding out the aroma profile well.

Taste  Throughout the taste there is a massive bready malt flavor. There is a light amount of caramel and light fruit sweetness at first mixed with a citrus hop flavor. The hop flavors at the beginning, while average for an IPA, then really start to gain strength. Citrus and pine hops start getting strong and start to bring some bitterness. The caramel sweetness is largely lost, but the citrus is still there. While the pine and citrus get stronger, they get huge and other hop flavors of a resinous earthy taste come to the tongue. All the hop flavors mix quite well and take the taste to the end, where they are greeted with a warming and lightly burning alcohol flavor, which oddly in some ways complements the hop quite well.

Mouthfeel The body of the beer is creamy and chewy with all those flavors really coating the mouth in all the wonderful flavors. The lower carbonation only accentuates the creaminess with it also accentuating the hop and booze burn as well.

Overall  Very heavy and tasty. Its mouthfeel is fantastic and it has a nice blend of hop and booze taste. A great brew for sipping nice and slow.","","Darkmagus82"

Where to start with the nose on this one ... well, I guess, at the start. The first aromas I picked up were that of vanilla and caramel primarily. After a little bit, some dark berry aromas start coming through followed shortly thereafter by a hint of nuts, figs, and plums. Theres also some licorice tucked away in there. The next round of aromas had a bit of a musty and damp smell to it, but it was also accompanied by a hint of pine, wood, and honey. By the end of the drink, I was also picking up citrus, cuacao, as well as banana & clove notes. It pours a clear honey orange color with a thick, beige, sudsy head thats in no rush to recede. A healthy, rocky lacing is left behind on the glass. A medium-high bitter (fairly moderate by Stone standards) combines with a medium malty sweetness. This full bodied beer is creamy going down; aided by an abundant, yet mellow and soft carbonation. The malty front end is a toasted caramel and roasted nut flavor with some hints of dark, meaty fruits (figs / plums). Mid mid drink, this also takes on a woodsy quality as well. Notes of pine, resin, and citrus combine for a full, but mellow bitter finish with a nice touch of bourbon-caramel alcohol warmth; it a mildly dry finish  The aftertaste left behind is a balanced blend of smokey caramel, grapefruit, and resin with a touch of licorice.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

2664,"2014-02-09",4.2,"This vicious brew punched me in the mouth and offered no apologies. Appearance is amber in color, bordering on dark brown. Whatever head there was quickly dissipated and left off white lacing on the sides of the glass as it was carefully consumed. Its significantly more aggressive than say its more timid associate (Arrogant Bastard), thanks to the elevated alcohol content. Weighing in at a healthy 11.2 percent it could be used in a pinch to power lawn equipment or remove rust. Though the intense flavor and backdrop does an adequate job disguising the elevated ABV. In my opinion the Double Bastard seems to have ironed out all the perceived shortcomings of Arrogant Bastard Ale however insignificant and delusional as they may be. The taste is well balanced for something as visceral as it is. The taste lies somewhere between being to hoppy and being overly malty. Flavors are reminiscent of roast caramel, heavy malts and rich aged leather, all accompanied by a steady backbeat of bitter and aromatic hops. As far as Im concerned Stone can do no wrong. This is a tasty beer meant to be enjoyed on a crisp winter evening accompanied by the warm harmony of a fire or as a sleep aid. All joking aside, its a very good beer.","USA","JOHNCONOR"

The aroma has a mixture of equal parts of each of its components: booze, floral hops, diacetyl, and bread or caramel malts. The taste is not as hoppy as I was expecting, and I must say that the mild sweetness offsets the mild bitterness well. The way this beer coats the mouth is interesting; its oily texture, soft body, and medium body make for an easy trip over the tongue, and the long finish that is both slightly bitter and slightly boozy keeps you wanting more.

2664,"2013-07-16",4.6,"This beer is huge in every way. Pours deep brown/red, with a thin off white head that dissipated pretty quickly. Huge malty aroma, caramel, dark fruits, with quite a bit of hop presence too. The taste was of dark fruits, cherry, hoppy bitterness, a lot of fairly sweet malt. The mouthfeel of this is one of its best points, for 11.2% its incredibly smooth, very full bodied, almost syrup like. Leaves a coating in your mouth and the taste lingers in a good way. My favourite Stone beer thus far and one of my favourites full stop.","","Smallprint"

Not that its bad, just a huge chore to drink. It pours a dark orange color with a small orangy head. The aroma has big caramel and toffee syrup and lighter notes of cocoa powder and fruity hops. The flavor is extremely bitter and harsh with lots of alcohol, syrupy caramel, toffee, dried fruit and pine sol. Brutal. I remember being more impressed with this a few years ago last time I tried it. I guess this is a testament to how far craft beer has come in the last 5 years or so.

2664,"2012-12-27",4.0,"Reviewed 11/12/2012. 22 oz. bottle poured into a Duvel tulip.

A: Pours a very dark ruby brown color with very little clarity. The head is nice for 11.2% - a one finger light mocha color with nice retention and a wonderful texture. It looks almost like cream floating on top of the beer. Theres a nice sheet of lacing down the glass, as well.

S: Dont know why, but the aroma isnt as explosive as I anticipated. The usual suspects of caramel, toffee, and nuttiness are there along with the piny/citrusy hops one would expect from a bastard, but I kind of expected a little more in general.

T: Well, it tastes just like a stronger version of Arrogant Bastard does; I dont know why i expected something different. Nuttiness is strong from the get go, while the finish is a classic Arrogant Bastard sneak-up-on-you-with-oily-pine-flavors. There seems to be a slightly brighter presence of citrus near the finish, and - naturally - the aftertaste is fairly boozy. I cant seem to pick up the faint vanilla presence other reviewers are detecting. The lack of complexity given its gravity is disappointing...but the Arrogant Bastard has never been about finesse, balance, subtlety, or nuance, has he?! Not quite as sweet as I expected, luckily.

M: Smooth and thick like a milkshake - right up until the hop oils sneak up on you. I love the feel of this in general; the boozy/resiny linger on the palate works perfectly for what this is trying to accomplish.

O: Every time Stone lets me down (see: 16th Anniversary IPA, SSR, IPA, and IRS to a lesser extent), I have something from them that restores my faith in them (see: 15th Anniversary black ale and Mint Chocolate Imperial Stout). So I guess this is another beer that helps raise my opinion of Stone somewhat? The shameless, heavy handed nature of Double Bastard is what gives it its charm - its the ephitet ""fuck you"" in beer form. I dont really like Arrogant Bastard anymore, so its good to know that someone else in the bastard family can come through for me.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

2006 vintage

The beer appears a russet brown with subtle crimson highlights. The head is substantial in stature and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is of alcohol, malts, and toffee. The hop character of the beer has faded during the aging process, so I am not detecting any of the fruit, hop, pineapple, or citrus flavors I have been told are well associated with Double Bastard Ale. The feel is thick and syrupy, with a strong alcohol presence throughout. I liked this much better than the Stone Old Guardian 2007 we had alongside this. This is a great beer to share a few ways and sip slowly on a cold night.

2664,"2012-06-14",4.3,"Stone is celebrating 10 years of the Double Bastard and I was fortunate enough to have the current vintage (2009) on draft at a local beer bar. Much appreciated treat for myself.

Beer was clear and brown. Formed a thin white head (slightly yellowish bubbles) and has low carbonation. Lacing is high, its an attractive beer.

The aroma is primarily hops and malt. There is some detectable alcohol in the nose, but its not solvent-like at all.

Beer is surprisingly smooth, really high bitterness at the back of the mouth, a little (less than I expected) sweetness at the front. Sweetness in the front is primarily malt based syrup flavor. Its good. There is some alcohol in the midpalate but its not bad and is well balanced by the high hop bitterness in the back. Drinkability is fine, not high, couldnt pound this beer, Mouthfeel is good, nice connectivity throughout the beer, good body, not thin or too thick. Beer gets a little dry after a few drinks but thats OK. A really nice beer.

Whenever I drink a beer like this I wonder how it will age. This is one of those strong ales that I bet would get sweeter with time as the hops fell back and the alcohol warmness mellowed.

2664,"2012-03-06",3.9,"From notes.  First reviewed 8/6/2011.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass. 2010 vintage.

Double Bastard is an impressive looking beer. A deep brown color with a cherry amber tint, this has a very full foamy white head that retains well and leaves a lot of lace. Eventually it dies down, which does not surprise me given the strength of the beer.

Lots of sugary sweetness, bown sugar, toffee, caramel in the nose. Tons of grapefruit hops in here as well. 

Brown sugar and toffee smooth sweetness come onto my palate up front, bringing an intensity unlike I would expect to see from anything but Double Bastard. The sweetness gradually turns into an ever-rising bitterness. Grapefruit flavors dominate a huge hop bill. There is a bit of an alcohol bite from the middle of the sip on.

This truly is one lacerative mother of an ale. Almost immediately, the tingle from the alcohol and hop bite causes my tongue to tingle. The alcohol leaves a slight burn in the throat and warms the stomach. The body is quite full, with carbonation that is creamy but still provides a bit of crisp character.

The only thing that really gets in the way of my pure enjoyment of this is the strong alcohol bite. A very good beer, one that I will savor and enjoy slowly.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Appearance is a hazy dark ruby with a tiny head that fades to a thin ring around the glass.

Smells of fruit but a couple different kinds. I pick up some orange, grapefruit, and pineapple presumably from the hops but then also dark fruit; figs and raisins. Also some wood.

The taste starts out quite sweet with some light citrus coming in next, much like an Imperial IPA. There is then a transition to the darker fruits more typical in a Barleywine. There is some vanilla along with wood towards the finish. A fairly strong bitterness comes in at the end along with some pineapple. Finally there is a somewhat drying bitterness with hints of tobacco.

Up front it is robust and grainy but it also carries a big hop kick of pine and citrus, somewhere between orange peel and grapefruit bitterness with the pine. The hops kind of soften the blow of grain and at the same time make it a bigger beer, although it goes down pretty easy with smooth carbonation and a medium body. The hops really dominate as it kind of has an oily palate that quickly turns dry with some grain texture in the bitterness and a touch of wood.

Taste: Much more bitter and hoppy than the aroma indicated. Loads of pine and citrus overwhelm the malt backbone of caramel, toffee, plum and cherry. Wait a sec, that was the review when it was 45 to 50 degrees. Once it hit 55 or so, it becomes much more malt driven.

Palate: Moderately low carbonation, pretty full body with a very dry finish. Slightly creamy texture.

Overall: If I didnt know that Stone made Old Guardian (which I have not yet reviewed at this point), then I would have assumed that this was their Barleywine. Kind of reminds me of Bigfoot or Old Ruffian with some age on it (maybe like six months to one year), but better!","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

Im pleasantly surprised. First impression I get is a nice, creamy, woody aroma. Peppery aftertaste. I like the resin flavor that the hops provides. Really complex, I keep discovering new impressions with every sip... Gets better as you go. Of course, alcohol warmth all the way through, but there is no bite or burn - it actually works pretty well, as long as your sipping. The palate is great, too - texture isnt too syrupy, and the carbonation is subtle but present. Just enough so that it goes down smooth. Taste is a mix of bitter, little sweet, and mild warmth.

Mouthfeel is medium to full, oily, medium, sometimes prickly carbonation.  A monster of a beer for sure.  I have an 09 that I will crack very soon for a comparison of not only age but the tweaking they did to this 10 batch.","Ringgold/Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA","elgiacomo"

2664,"2011-02-21",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2014 2009 release. Comes in the usual Stone bottle with a bunch of hogwash on the back. Served around 50.

Pours into my American pint glass with a dark brownish red with a short lived white head that leaves some lacing.

Smell is like floral hop candy. Hints of sugary caramel blend with some doughy, bready malts. The hops are very floral and perfumey. There is some fruitiness in there too.

Taste is huge with smooth malts and good bittering hops. Theres so much going on with each, the malts are slightly chocolaty and roasty, sweet, and a bit caramally, the hops are nice and bitter with a touch of pine. The alcohol is more prevalent as you go.

The mouthfeel is decadent and the drinkability amazing the style.

Overall this is a big beer that is worth challenging, because it is highly drinkable and smooth, not an alcohol bomb like it could have been.

In 2007, it seems a little touch of thinner color but stands with elegant figure. We close our face to the glass at the moment, and we all looked at each other with grinning. It maintains a superb sense of balance. Port wine atmosphere and the nuances of oloroso sherry gradually. A little zesty hop flavor is still marvelous, and I found the hop protected beer ageing quietly for sure. So cute. I felt that this time is kind of peak active aging point for this beer. Off course may still keep on, but it will be calm another 3-5 years from this point. I am interested in what is going on, but it was a very good timing to have it now after 3 years of bottling. 2007 bottle and 2010 tap connected with beautiful line certainly. Incredible.

4.5 A: Hazy amber-brown color. Two fingers of thick, creamy yellowish white head that retains well and covers the glass in lacing.

4.5 S: Sweet caramel and toffee malts. Hops are intense, especially given the high gravity here. Aromatic and citrusy hops centered around orange and to a lesser extent, pine and peach.

4.0 T: Tasty brew here. Strong toffee and caramel from the top. Raisin and tobacco to some extent alongside a peach and orange fruitiness. Healthy hop bitterness which works well to balance the malt onslaught. Hops lend the citrusy taste as well as a bit of astringency. However, regardless of all the good qualities, there is just too much booziness. If I were to guess without knowing the ABV beforehand, I would put this brew at 16%.

3.5 M: Thick, viscous body. Bubbly carbonation, maybe a bit too much. Alcohol brings down the smoothness, but does give a nice warming on finish.

3.5 D: Really tasty brew. One of the few brews that manages to get lots of malt flavor AND lots of hop flavor, and do both well. However, its simply too boozy, especially for only 10.5%.

The flavor is likewise overflowing with hop bitterness, eliciting the feeling of eating a ripe grapefruit at a small table in the middle of a pine forest after a rainstorm. Not content to just be a hop bomb, though, this one also has a substantial malt backbone, with big flavors of caramel and toffee.

Sweet caramel malt aromas overpower distinct citrus fruity and grassy hop aromas. There is more complexity to the aroma in this beer than described.

Sweet burnt toffee and caramel malt notes with bitterness exceedingly prominent regardless of the medium full body. Flavours not as complex, but worthy nonetheless.

Poured with a decent white head, that dissipated quickly. Hazy copper-brown color. Nice, but not overwhelming hops and a good deal of maltiness. Huge hop smack up front (burn baby burn), and some warming alcohol pops in before a malty end. Thicker MF, and near creamy. Very light on the carbonation. Almost viscous. Despite the whack of hops, this is surprisingly balanced. Alcohol was almost not noticeable, which helped with the drinkability. Overall, I thought this was fantastic.

2664,"2010-04-21",3.6,"2007 bottle that I am finishing as I review.

A-Great appearance on this brew. The body is a beautiful transparent deep mahogany color. Moderate pour produces an aggressive 3 finger light beige colored head. Head slowly fades to 1 finger with a smooth and creamy look (in a standard glass) and has great retention. Plenty of lacing is left behind.

S- Nose is promising with aggressive citrus and piny hop aromas fighting for dominance with a harsh spiciness. A big presence of alcohol looms in the background. No malt detected in the nose.

T-Initial taste is almost sweet. Caramel and chocolate malts are present with an accent of citrus hop flavor. A big spiciness bursts forth for the finish and the flavors present for the initial flavor vanish and are replaced with a big hop bitterness and a large kick of alcohol. A slight alcohol warmth lingers with nothing to accompany it with the exception of an aggressive (of medium strength...nothing too powerful or overwhelming) hop bitterness that lingers on and on and never goes away. The taste is wonderful at the beginning but ends slightly below average. Overall an average taste.

P- Medium to high stinging carbonation that temporarily vanishes but reappears for the swallow (very interesting). Body is thick and sticky-loaded with hops, caramel malt, and alcohol...but still has a pleasurable smoothness.

O- Drinkability gets an ""above average"" score from me. The taste is average but this brew screams ""American Strong Ale"" in almost every category. Its slightly more enjoyable than regular AB but is nowhere near oaked AB (which seems to take everything arrogant about the AB lineup and make it more smooth and mature). I enjoy reading the long-winded arrogant description on the back of these bottles but this honestly does not stand out to me as a superior ASA. Im glad I was able to sample this bottle-but my choice from the AB lineup is still oaked AB.

The raisins and oranges again make an appearance in the middle and are followed by a bitter, piney finish. The biggest flaw is that the beer is a bit hot.

M: The body is fantastic. Very full with an almost chewy texture and a moderate level of carbonation. The finish is surprisingly dry.

The alcohol is well hidden, perhaps a touch shows on finish, but because of effective use of hops it is not distracting. The finish is dominated by more lingering bitter hops and caramel. Overall: I love this beer. Gotta stock up the cellar, this is a great year and it should age very well. Recommended.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","manuchampions"

2664,"2010-02-02",4.3,"Here we are again Stone, ""Hello.""  What did you bring with you in that case of yours?  A bounty of hops Im guessing.  Really, how could you asume anything else.  Stone does always say, maybe just a little more.  I appreciate their bold persona and their beers.  The beer is full of heady Northwestern American hops - Tomahawk, Chinook, Warrior, Cascades and alcoholic laden malt bodies, oh that oily hoppitude.   The beer is a dark orange-brown color with a thick rust head.  Sexual lacing along the side of the glass.  Id describe this drink like handling a ram in your mouth.  Its not for beginners, in fact your likely to cave in from your mouth making a unique spectacle.  The beer is like a smoking hop being ground into your mouth.  When along comes an alcohol medley via fortified malts.  The beer is unapologetically full, oily, with soft carbonation.  The finish is abruptly bitter that cools and yields to the alcohol.

The nose initially brings a strong character of west coast hops, followed by moderate to heavy notes of crystal malts and perhaps some continental character malts.  Finally, some alcohol is detectable in the aroma, but it stops short of being overpowering or unpleasant.  The palate is large and full, again first showing a significant level of bitterness, especially given the beers gravity and the undoubtedly heavy malt bill.  Flavors then transfer to toffee, fresh baked bread, and some depth added by the alcohol on the back end.  Overall, the lightness of the beer was decieving, as it deftly hid its abv.

Not a whole lot in the smell department. Light hints of sweet malts and some floral and citrus hops notes. Light caramel presence, but mostly hops.

Hey, what do you know? A beer from Stone thats actually getting close to being balanced. The hops still dominate, as usual, but its closer.
This has an underlying sweet malty profile that, for once, is actually putting up a good effort to get noticed. 
Mild caramel and sweet malt taste. Pine and grapefruit notes. Slight bitterness.
Not nearly as harsh as Arrogant Bastard.

Smooth and basically creamy. Just a slight touch of sharpness. Nice lower medium level of carbonation.

I have to say that, being from Stone (who I actually like, despite how it may sound), this is a pretty darn drinkable beer. I find most of their brews to be way out of balance, but this one goes down pretty smooth.

2664,"2009-11-18",4.6,"Oh joy, Ive finally found the time to post!  My journal needs some online alleviation.  For my first post, well start with this exceptional brew.  When the 09 DB came to my favorite beer shop, I decided to buy an 08 vintage as well and do a side-by-side.  

The 08 poured mahogany with a light tan head into a snifter.  On the nose I smelled a rich barley wine (love that smell); toffee, malty, slight raisony wonder.  Taste mimicked the aroma.  Fantastic upfront taste of toffee with a slight lasting bitterness, a little odd, but not unwelcome raisin/pineapple taste detectable, fairly nice balance of sweet and bitter.  Finishes rather bitterly with some nice warming alcohol present at the back of the throat.  This brew warms exceptionally well; hop bitterness fades, replaced by more alcohol and toffee sweetness.  Marvelous finish.  

The 09 poured the same as the 08.  As can be expected, this did not live up to its predecessor.  More of a candied sugar aroma with a hoppy presence.  The taste holds with the aroma; more pure sweetness than rich toffee, more prevalent hops (probably due to the lack of sweetness with age compared to the 08).  This was more or less a weaker version of its predecessor.  Still damn fine, but I firmly believe this brew should be aged a while.  The 08 was astounding, I did my rating on that vintage.","Idaho, USA","TLNash886"

2664,"2009-08-11",4.2,"Well, well, well. I just bought a selection of Stone Beers and it would be an understatement to say I was highly anticipating the new experiences I was about to have. I had to dive straight in at the Double Bastard, as it was the original Arrogant Bastard that blew me away in the first place. Appearance is just lovely. Copper, amber glow, rust, and at times just red in appearance, with an off-white/tan head that has rapidly shrunk, lazy carbonation just about struggles to the surface. The aroma is very inviting, mellow but definite hops, good soft malt with abundant fruitiness backed up with ripe strawberries, an aroma similar to damp or wet concrete, orange zest and assorted citrus notes and caramel. Well the flavour is intense but remains balanced, both the alcohol and hops get you at the back of the throat rather than clogging up your palate. Theres something almost wine like about the beer, not vinous but it reminds me of the beer equivalent of a big Ozzy Shiraz, thick, dense and complex. The malts ooze over your tongue hiding inside a deceptive bitterness that unleashes itself at the last moment with an almost earthy feel to it. The hops are floral, perfumed and very tasty, there is an acridness to them but not a soapiness, and the acrid nature is not too full on as its contained deep within a coating of thick semi-sweet caramel malt. The flavour is so big Im almost at a loss to pick it apart, I almost dont even want too. Its like an experience, you have to try it to really understand it. The beer itself is somewhere between a barley wine and a double IPA, although leans more to the latter. Im going to shut up now because I dont think I have the vocabulary or even desire to capture this beast, its like meeting a wild Lion, you just have to be thankful you walked away intact, you wouldnt want to cage such a beautiful monster, allow it to be wild, untamed try not to pin it down too much or the magic is lost. Just one thing though, the palate is to die for, its like thick velvet caressing and coating your tongue and warming your throat. The only draw back is the slightly untamed alcohol which does ride quite high in the mix, but as the bottle warns: only fools dare, so I cant complain. Stone are truly Demons among men, and Im beginning to love them for it.","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"

2664,"2009-08-04",4.3,"Stone Brewing is one of the newer highly anticipated California breweries that are now available in Florida. By the time she made to my shelves late last year though, I had already missed out on most of her special seasonal releases, the Double Bastard 2008 release being one of those. Thankfully, the folks were on a trip and stopped in a liquor store to pick me up some goodies, beer and sake, and the clerk hooked them, and thusly me, up with some nice rare beers and sake.


Burnt amber and garnet with a hazy brown murkiness which adds a mysterious aura. Not much of a head to speak of while she sports a thin collar that also threatens to fade into oblivion. Her head may have been nothing to write home about, but let me tell you about her nose. Grass, lots of grass, flowers, green leaves and sticky hop oils lead into more green hops in their whole entirety, picked fresh from the vine as their presence permeates the air around them. Sweet grass mowed with fresh morning dew finishes with a dry punch of dry hay and crunchy honeycomb. No, not the cereal, real honeycomb dripping with the fruit of hundreds of hard-working bees. Obviously the head knew better then to get in the way of this Mack-truck of a nose barreling its way to wherever it durn well pleases. Like a beer geek frozen in its headlights, I throw caution to the wind and dive right into her path. Whats a little danger, right? Dry and herbal, like a gourmet rub to tempt and taunt and seduce my tastebuds. Green leaves, hops and grass scrub also center on top of my tongue for a tasty palate cleansing experience. Her dryness is balanced by a sweetness slowly swells in the background thick with honey, honeycomb, and burnt sugars. Hop oils continue to coat while further fields of grass and hay dry at the same time. I always enjoy the playful interplay of dry and wet at the same time; it only serves to quench ones thirst while adding to it at the same time. Its no wonder then that my glass is quickly diminishing in volume; thankfully Double Bastard comes in large 22oz bomber bottle. A pleasant warmth slowly starts to blossom in my chest before spreading throughout my body, a testament to her higher ABV which also adds a nip of spice at the back of each quaff. Mmm. From start to finish, a big hoppy, grassy, sweet and yet dry, woodsy and warm brew that I look forward to quaffing this year, also.


What can I say about Stone Brewing that I havent already said and probably will say again later. Great brewery, great beers, and they make no apologies for being big, bad, and doing exactly what they want. If you dont like their beers, tough.

2664,"2009-04-05",4.2,"22oz bottle. Pours a clear, but dark ruby-brown body with a off-white to beige head that leaves more of a swirly surface than the Bastard and thicker lacing on the glass. The body is more red than the Bastard. Aroma is chewier than the Bastard. Thicker and sweeter berry malts. Almost like a barley wine, actually. Much bigger than the Bastard maltwise. Lots of sweet caramels. The hops are just as in your face as the Bastard, but these seem brighter. Much more noticeable citrus and definitely not as earthy. The booze is noticeable, but blends more with the hops rather than berries. The flavor is much more aligned with my tastes. Big! Lots of malts, lots of hops, and a warming booze. Starts with a sweet, but somewhat earthy bitterness and licorice malt taste. The bitterness quickly grows in the middle, but never becomes quite as earthy or dirty as the Bastard. Despite that, the hops remain ample. Stays more along the lines of a heavily hopped barley wine. An intense sugary citrus hoppiness. The malts grow and the caramel becomes fuller. Some dried fruits, raisin, grainy rye, and booze come in before the finish. The finish is a mix between barley wine and strong ale...but mega-hoppy. Sweet, but bitter and stong/bold, but fruity. Dryer than the Bastard. Flavor doesnt linger obsessively like the Bastard, but definitely sticks around for awhile. Slightly earthy, but more of a piney hop linger. Not quite sharp, but on the edge. Sugary sweet maltiness, but not as resiny as a barley wine. Overall, I guess what Im trying to say is that the hops are intense, but there is a lot more going on besides the hops in this one. Much better balance IMO than the Bastard. I cant help but think this is a mix between a typical barley wine and strong ale. Really nice stuff right here!","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

2664,"2009-03-04",4.0,"2008 bomber in a pint glass. Pours with a one-finger off-white head that sticks to the upper third of the glass. The aroma is all hops - piney and floral with a juicy grapefruit bitterness. The sweetness of the caramel malt doesnt show its presence until you taste the beer, providing a nice balance to the strong bitterness of the hops. The mouthfeel is sticky, like light syrup. Be careful - the alcohol sneaks up on you quickly - it started going to my head only half-way through the first glass. This is an excellent beer - highly recommended.","Spokane, Washington, USA","GreggG"
2664,"2009-03-01",4.4,"From a 22oz bottle this Ale pours a ruby amber with a very nice, thick tan head.  Lots of lacing.  Aroma jumps right out of the glass at you - citrus hops and sweet malts with lots of spice and alcohol.  This big beer comes right after you on the first sip with the malts, bitter hops and spiciness - but the alcohol is never overwhelming.  I was actually surprised how different this beer came across than the Arrogant Bastard.  This is a fantastic beer that I would certainly drink again (and again).","Morrisville, North Carolina, USA","brewski519"

A- Pours a murky dark amber hue with a watery off-white head, lacing is excellent throughout

S- Rich, strong hops, tones of pine and citrus, considerable alcohol presence

T- What can I say other than Amazing! I like Double Bastard, and this is the longest aged bottle I have ever had. Initial taste is dominated by piney/citrus hops followed by cherry and honey sweetness. Aftertaste is a brief hoppy bitterness balanced by sweet malts. Alcohol is fairly evident, but not entirely overwhelming.

Quite an integrated, English-like combo of house yeast fruitiness, caramelised malt and floral/citrus hops that reminds me of Fullers, White Shield, Burton Bridge... every now and again a waft of pure hop joy. But its not enough. Alcohol and hop astringency in the mouth. Alpha floral and tanging with soapy citrus but overwhelmed by booze, shampoo and quinine. The punch of hops without the promised aromatics. Aftertaste utterly drenched with retronasal alcohol, if no burn. Slick and full but losing its lace and head. Tipping some into Octos glass.

This has been cellaring for about a year now.  Of the 2006 vintage it was a bit of a letdown.  Going big for the sake of going big is not always a good idea.  It could have been this particular year or maybe it is better fresh but the overall impression was only redeemable because of the price paid.

Aroma / Appearance - A delicate one finger head rested above a creamy opaque maple colored body.  Malty and dense it reminded me of caramel apples, chocolate truffles, and wood residue.  Overall it was not unlike bread pudding.

Flavor / Palate - Caramel bites attack the throat as the alcohol is evident from the start.  A delayed bitterness slowly unfolds on the back of the tongue.  An oaky finish wraps up a reasonable experience but nothing that you do not find in other big beers.  Balanced but a little stale it might have slid over the past year.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

2664,"2009-01-16",3.9,"A vertical tasting of vintages 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2008.
The 2003 and 2008 were sampled together, and the 2004 and 2006 were sampled the following evenings.

Vintage 2008 bottled on on 9/12/08. 

Pours dark amber with a ruby hue. Clear body with a half inch head of off white. Some light rings of lacework after the short head fell, and a partial skim coat remained on the surface for the duration.

Aromatics lead off with jammy malt, red and tropical fruits, and warming alcohol. 
Peaches, apricots and melons lead the way for shadows of red grapes, cherries, and bourbon-spiked honey.
Sweetish and quite juicy.

On the thick side of medium bodied. Sticky and chewy mouthfeel. A bit light on the carbonation.

Sweet crystle malt, ripe fruit, fresh caramel, and a resinous bitterness start the palate. Warming alcohol steps forward as well as hints of caramel-candied apple, spruce dew, and candied figs.

Finishes with a lingering warmth, sustaining bitterness, and drawn-out sweet fruit. 

A classic American strong ale that dances along the lines of a Barleywine. 
Next up, a mini vertical with an aged example.

Vintage 2003:

Pours cloudy, dark amber, with a half inch head of off white. A slow retreat revealed some spongy lacework and a few whisps on the placid surface.

Aromatics are heavy on the malt, with lots of wet leather, rotting cedar, wet paper, and Sherry. Very earthy and oxidized. Hops are not to be found, and the nose rounds out with hints of cocoa, cardboard, and dried earth.

Medium bodied, but very syrupy and chewy. A slick, tacky mouthfeel with subdued carbonation.

Stale malt, wet and dusty boards, worn leather, and earth-dusted chipped toffee start the palate. Oxidized Sherry steps forward as well as a warming boozy note and tannic caramel.

Finishes with a lingering dried earth note, dusty leather, stale malt, and old wood tinders. 

Not a fan of the five year old DB.

Side by side with the 2008 freshie:

Wow, I wouldnt believe that they were the same beer unless I poured it myself. The freshie is cleaner, infinately hoppier all around, and much brighter. The peaches and apricots really shine though when sided with the oldster DB.

Vintage 2004

Pours clear, dark amber with a two inch head of off white. Retention is moderate and theres some decent lacing after the fall.

Aromatics lead off with ripe, red fruits, sweet malt, and alcohol. Significantly more boozy than the 2003 or 2008. 
Slightly vineous with hints of bourbon fusels, cherries, figs, and sherry.

On the thick side of medium bodied. Slightly syrupy and plenty slick.

Dark fruits, cherry-infused malt, and bourbon-spiked toffee start the palate. A mild throat burn quickly steps forward as well as a peppery warmth.

Finishes with lingering alcohol, sweet malt, and fading red fruits.

Hardly a trace of oxidation in the 2004, which makes it pretty amazing how quickly this beer goes off the deep end. Looks like four years in the cellar is the max for a Double Bastard.

Vintage 2006

Pours murky dark amber, with a one inch head of off white. A partial skim coat remained on the surface for the duration, along with some spotty lacework.

Aromatics lead off with dry, papery malt, caramel, toffee, earthy cedar, and a trace of cocoa. Warming alcohol follows through along with wet cardboard.

On the thick side of medium bodied and chewy. A creamy and somewhat syrupy mouthfeel.

Drying malt, caramel dust, and hints of cocoa, nougat, and wet boards start the palate.
Dark fruits, warming alcohol, and an approachable biterness follow through.

Finishes with lingering cardboard-infused malt, stale chocolate, and a drying bitterness.

Concensus:

The 2004 was remarkable and somehow far superior to the 2006. Zero oxidation and was clearer in the glass.
Id like to think that the perfect amount of time for DB in the cellar is four years if you use the 2004 as a benchmark. The 2006 disproves this though.

Vintages in order of best to worst:
2008
2004
2006
2003

Note: All were stored in the cellar on thier sides for the duration, and the 2006 was very close to the 2003 in last place.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","brewandbbq"

2664,"2008-11-29",3.8,"Bomber.  Missed this both the last two years.  Huge lacerative nose, strong alcohol but thats nothing compared to the massive citrus and pine hops, powerful gritty caramel malt, and warm lemony biscuits effusing from the neck.  Woody, earthy, but all about the hops.  Deep copper-mahogany pour with a thick, rocky tan head.  Taste is punishingly bitter but moreso alcoholic.  Malty, sticky, chewy caramel taste, earth and wood with an overabundance of pine but less resin and far less grapefruit and lychee.  Lemon citrus and a little orange rind, very high-pitched fruty notes.  Fresh leafy green hop leaves, sugars are pretty well done but still sweet (and the thing laces pretty well).

Aroma of dark berries, fruity candy, sweet malts... well actually I think it’s like smelling into a bag of candy or something... not that wrong. Some american hops there too.

Flavour is fruity with a big bitterness. It also got notes of fruit candy with a sweet, pleasant aftertaste. Lots of american hop-notes with a obvious taste of grapefruit. Very good. Some warming alcohol in the taste.

Very filling, fullbodied and nice in the mouth. The carbonation is average and very nice. A bit sticky, but not in a bad way.

A very nice sipper. Reminds me a little of american barley wines, but it has some other characteristics as well. My next bottle will be standing for a while though.","Karlstad, SWEDEN","Ljunkan"

Taste is a bit more hops than I was expecting and a whole bunch of spiciness that caught me off guard. Very enjoyable, but nothing to mess around with. Good amount of caramel malts and to a lesser amount some toffee. This is a good beer fresh. I’ve had an older bottle that was amazingly good, but fresh, this stands up there with the rest of them.

Malt character is full and undeniable- dark sweetness melds with the powerful hop blast seamlessly. Flavor is like getting hit by a freight train made of hops. Malt character is deep and foreboding.

2664,"2008-11-19",4.1,"2008 Release.

Appearance: Pours a clear, reddish amber body with a well-formed, sustaining, off-white head. Copious amounts of lacing on the way down.

Smell: Aromatic hoppy nose, some sweetish hints to it, and smelling of fresh orange peel, exotic flowers, pine resin, and a splash of pomegranate liqueur. Caramel-scented maltiness underneath. Very, very minor wafts of alcohol.

Taste: Sweet caramel-laden maltiness with a pinch of light brown sugar and a quick drizzle of simple syrup brace themselves for the impact of hops. Quick montage of fruit flavors - oranges, grapefruits, pomegranates, even sweet cherries. This precedes a solid jolt of straight-up citrus and pine hoppiness with a full, sturdy bitterness. Definitely a warming beer, but not quite hot or bracing for me. Drying finish with a touch of booze and more than a touch of bitter hops.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: Recommended! I’m ashamed to admit it’s been more than a few years since I’ve had a bottle of this to myself, but I’m more than pleased to be having a fresh bottle and am happy they’re finally, at long last, distributing to the state of Georgia.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

The aroma hits my nose upon uncapping this one - beautifully fresh juicy citrus (grapefruit) hops with a very sturdy malt character to balance the hops.  The flavor is the same but with a more pronounced alcohol presence sneaking through.  The grapefruit hop character fades into a bitter earthy and pine character on the finish.  Though the flavor is very solid, the hotness of the alcohol detracts from its quality.  It is medium to thick bodied on the palate with soft subtle carbonation.  Overall: very solid but a bit rough.

Spices and booze also abound  this is certainly a winter warmer. At first sip you can tell this is a big beer. The bitterness of the hops lingers, but is never overpowering.

2664,"2008-10-16",3.9,"22oz bomber from a kick ass liq. store you wish you lived by... Pours a dark, clear brown/copper with highlights of dark amber and a large tan head. The aroma is strong - quite hoppy with some citrus/pine, but also very malty (lots of caramel) with a good bit of alcohol. The taste starts complex with a two-edged bitterness: a hint of roasted grains with a dark chocolate or coffee-like bitterness and a large presence of hops. The flavor is quite reminiscent of the ""weaker"" version - but sweeter and more alcohol. The middle of the palate detects more roasted grains, some biscuity malts, subtle touches of fruity esters, and hops. The finish isnt as long as its lowly ""arrogant"" brethren and is much more warming. The mouthfeel is heavily carbonated (pour vigorously or swirl in glass to release it and to add creaminess to the texture) and medium- to-full in body.

Man, this is smooth and rich. The body of this is everything I love in the feel of a beer. Pretty much perfect in the feel. The bitter hoppiness is there, but they are amazingly balanced with a soft, and slightly sweet backbone. I find myself pondering over how wonderfully smooth it is again.

I love Arrogant Bastard so I was not only very happy to find a bottle of this on a road trip but I also had high expectations. The Double Bastard didnt let me down! Pours a reddish color, nice clarity, with a thin off-white head. Aroma is sweet caramel, cherries, alcohol and some pine. The flavors are sharp and delicious. Lots of sweet caramel malt, some toffee, with a blast of hops, pine and some grapefruit. Finishes bitter with just a little alcohol showing but my palate adjusted quickly (or bowed down to its goodness) and this was just so damn tasty. A wonderful brew that I cant wait to have again.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

Excellent beer... will seek out again!    - Original Rating - Sample at the 2008 VT Brewers Fest - Poured a very dark amber in color with a very small light tan head.  Aroma is of coffee, brown sugar, caramel and a good amount of floral hops.  Flavor is somewhat hoppy and a bit malty sweet to start with the hop bitterness coming in at the end.

Thick and full-feeling, pretty nice stuff.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

Taste was good and hoppy, certainly a nice malt base here too. I do have to say some of the bitterness had some harshness to it; harshness does not equal badass. Heavier side of medium bodied and a medium amount of carbonation. Overall, good beer for sure, but I can’t help but think a different hop choice could make this so much better. Don’t take the above comment the wrong way, it’s just my opinion and Stone does a damn fine job as it is. Would buy again.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"

It starts with a sweet caramel maltiness which gives way to darker roast barley notes and finishes with a dry bitter hoppiness. The only thing that kept it from a 10 in flavor was the alcohol heat overpowers the hop finish a bit. Regardless, this is a fantastic brew.","Santa Cruz, California, USA","hoppopotamus"

Thin head (maybe it was just the pour). I drank it VERY slowly... just because its a beer to treat with some level of respect. Malts can be detected, but the hop bitters it out too much.

this beer poured a cloudy (perhaps sediment from cooling it in the rapid beverage chiller) orange-ish brown with very little and and little lacing. carbonation abounds. i should add that the beer cleared up and i didnt see any sediment in the glass, so i am not sure what that was all about, but it was inconsequential. 

this beer smells of raisins and caramel. a bit of spice in the nose as well. i can detect the alcohol, which is not a bad thing.

the taste is consistent with the smell, however it becomes much more complex as it warms. i can best describe the beginning of this beer as very agressive, starting sweet and finishing bitter, however superbly balanced.

the mouthfeel is quite full with hella carbonation. makes me wonder where the head went?

I got a bit more of the hops in the taste and it was balanced very well given the ABV.  Syrupy but prickly, this definitely coats your mouth but has enough carbonation to tickle the tongue a bit.

Big malt upfront, with strong bitters coming through mid-palate and lathering more boldly through the back pull.  The sweetness contains some caramel, ripened peaches (definitely fruit, but not overbearing), and hints of roasted peat.  The ABV is nicely integrated.  The mouthfeel is thick, almost creamy without being ""chewy"".  There is plenty going on here, nicely complex.  A nice contrast presents, with a totally different ending than beginning.  Sweet vs. bitter is definitely explored in this strong brew!  I wonder if this exploration was ""full force"", or if was approached in a linear, progressive continuity.

The 05 was in a growler poured at the brewery that day, and the 06 and 07 were in 22oz. bottles. I drank all three out of the same exact style of glasses, beginning with the youngest release.  Appearance: All three years pour almost exactly the same color, the 05 may be a touch lighter in color. Vibrant brown/red color with a thin off-white head. The head on the 06 lasts the longest by far, followed second by the 05.  Aroma: 07: Hoppy and spicy, not much maltiness, and theres a touch of alcohol in the background. 06: Smells much sweeter, hops are much more subdued and sweet smelling rather than spicy. Still some alcohol but not as much.
05: Even more sweet and subdued than the previous two.  Flavor: 07: Hoppy, almost like a dark IPA, but not. Hops are spicy up front and finish sweet. The malts in there also contribute a bit to the sweetness but the hops are the star of this show. 06: My first impression is earthy. Still hoppy of course, but the hops have mellowed &&#35;40;sorry for the cliche&&#35;41;. A little citrus in there as well, grapefruit. To me, the alcohol bite on the finish is much more than on the 07. 05: Mellow, and the most mellow part is the booze, just a hint in the aftertaste, smooth otherwise. Hops are faint and sweet up front and spicy towards the finish.  Palate: I refilled my glasses for the mouthfeel portion and again the head on the 06 totally showed up the head on the other two years. 07: Its actually thick, but its crisp enough that it feels much thinner. Nice carbonation.
06: Thicker, not quite as crisp. Smooth though, the carbonation has mellowed.
05: The thickest, not by a ton of course, but it is the thickest. Carbonation has smoothed out some, still nice, but not as crisp.  Overall: Of course, all of these releases are still drinking nicely. Ill be honest, I like the hops in the fresh stuff an","San Diego, California, USA","doubleo"

2664,"2008-01-16",4.2,"This beer really wants to try to kick the crap out of you, it says so right on the bottle. Haha! Looks and smells similar to the Bastard Ale, but the taste takes it a step stronger. More malts, more hops, more alcohol, fewer apologies and even less balance. This is highly recommended for people who have liked Bastard Ale in the past.","Levittown, New York, USA","Chapel"
2664,"2008-01-14",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2008 22 oz bomber at 2nd Houston Tasting, thanks to TexasJeep.  Pours a dark, reddish-amber with an off-white head.  Irregular lacing.  Wow, when they say double they arent kidding.  Its like they put double the malt and double the hops in this bad boy!  The aromas of sweet malt and hops are pronounced.  The flavor was also sweet malt with citrus hops and some spices.  Mouthfeel was thick and creamy with nice bitterness in the aftertaste.  Really enjoyed the sample.  Will definitely have to get a whole bottle for myself.  Blows Arrogant Bastard away!  Addition after buying and drinking a whole bottle myself:  this was like a barleywine more than a strong ale.  Texture was melded into that sort of peach nectar sweet creaminess one sometimes gets from a barleywine whose hops are past fresh.  Love this brew.","Land of Sugar, Texas, USA","MaltOMeal"
2664,"2008-01-12",3.5,"This was a bastard of a beer like the name implies, with a hilarious message on the bottle.

2664,"2008-01-11",4.3,"22oz bottle.   I had the pleasure of trying this during the same session as Arrogant Bastard, and I think the comparison helped me understand there beers much more.   DB has a very similar appearance, with maybe a little more honey in the body, and a slightly darker and fluffier head.   The aroma is malty and pretty hoppy with lots of candied citrus; richer and more balanced than AB.   The flavor is similarly balanced with massive malts, citrus hopps and a little alcohol.   The way it all blends into one smooth experience really sets it above.   All the flavors work well together, over a thick and slightly syrupy body.   Lots of intense flavors, and you definitely cant drink a lot of it, but the balance and smoothness hold it all together beautifully.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"
2664,"2008-01-09",3.9,"Somewhat overrated, in my opinion.  A solid strong ale, but a little unrefined.  The fruit notes are underdeveloped, where youd hope to have a little identifiable character rather than just an impression of fruitiness.  An enjoyable brew, but not exceptional.

Janurary 9th 2008 - This is my favorite beer of all time, every year I look forward to its release.  Stone Brewing freakin rocks!  I guess Ill just wait for the IRS instead!  

April, 5th 2008 - Ok well I just picked up another 7 bottles of this and 6 of them are gone.  This is by far the best session brew of all time.  I drink 3 of these and I start walking funny.  I drank an 06 vintage and got a huge malt bomb!!!  It was freakin delcious.  The fresh stuff stings your tastes buds with refreshing hops and super malt.  This beer is on steriods or something.  It is the most unique beer I have ever drank and impresses me more and more everytime I drink it(which is atleast once a week).  I have drained New Jersey of this beer completely, I am always on the prowl for more.  Next release Im buying 5 cases, hopefully it will last me the winter, but who really knows.  This beer needs to move into the top 1 for sure.  For my 24th birthday I had a 1/2 keg of Oaked Bastard which was delicious just not as good as the Double.  This year to celebrate my quarter century of living, Im getting a 1/2 barrel of Double Bastard.  If you want to come send me a Beermail.  All are welcome to come enjoy this masterpiece on tap.  Maybe Ill write a letter to the president of Stone Brewing Co. and ask for a 1/2 barrel of some kind of barrel aged Double Bastard.  That would freakin rock!!!!  

April 20th, 2007 (420) Yesterday my wife, little broski, and I went to a tattoo convention in Philly and had a great time.  On our way home there was a Canals liquor store I had never been in.  So we had to stop to check out thier beer selection.  It was very limited, but they did have nine bottles of Double Bastard on the shelf.  So I grabbed all of them with joy and my wife rolled her eyes at me.  I took the nine bottles to the counter and asked the young lady running the register if they had any more.  Sure enough the beer manager comes running up with a whole case that was sitting in the back!!!!  So I bought the whole case and left with a huge grin on my face knowing I have some Double Bastard once again to ration out over the next couple weeks.  Im in the dog-house with my wife though, but thats okay because I have 12 delicious Double Bastards sitting in my living room.","The-No, California, USA","TheRealBastard"

06 Growler. Pour is deep ruby with two fingers of toffee colored head. Aromas strong of sweet malt, apricots, alcohol, and caramel. This brew seemed to almost condense itself.

Taste is very interesting.....but i really like it!  Sweet on the outset, then turns very hoppy.  The end is again very sweet and some alcohol, like a barleywine, but like Zinister said, still very drinkable.  Aftertaste is very hoppy and has a slight alcohol burn as it goes down.

The taste starts complex with a two-edged bitterness: a hint of roasted grains with a dark chocolate or coffee-like bitterness and a large presence of hops. The flavor is quite reminiscent of the ""weaker"" version - but sweeter and more alcohol. The middle of the palate detects more roasted grains, some biscuity malts, subtle touches of fruity esters, and hops. The finish isnt as long as its lowly ""arrogant"" brethren and is much more warming. The mouthfeel is heavily carbonated (pour vigorously or swirl in glass to release it and to add creaminess to the texture) and medium- to-full in body.

2664,"2007-12-21",4.0,"This is indeed a Double Bastard!  Its one massive beer.  The body is a thick, syrupy, cloudy, dark reddish brown color.  A large, foamy, light tan colored head settles slowly to a wispy film, leaving intricate patterns of lacing etched onto the glass.  The aroma is fruitier than I expected, a surprising dose of peaches intermingling with the requisite grapefruit and orange hops.  Big, heavy caramel and toffee malts are kissed with huge, oaky vanilla scents.  The flavor is comprised of the same components, though the fruitiness takes a bit of a backseat to the huge, oaked toffee malts.  Expertly blended for supreme balance, despite its enormity.  The body is downright thick and syrupy, a slight negative in my book, though its a minor flaw I am willing to overlook.  This one reminds me of a more refined, more realistic, more drinkable version of DFH 120.  Theres just so much complexity going on here in such a massive package.

The flavor included chewy caramel malt, brown sugar, grapefruit rind, and a sweet, warming alcoholic note.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied and filling, also lightly sticky and syrupy.

No real flavor coming from the generous amount of hops, just bitterness. Starts off hoppy with a sweet bread like maltiness. Quick to follow is a certain sweetness I cant quite put my finger on (maybe caramel) mixed with a grapefruit west coast hop bitterness. Long bitter finish with slight alcohol warming in the stomach. After taste of citrus hops lingers on your tongue and gums. Good, I really like Arrogant Bastard better. Sipper of a beer, with what is surely to be a ton of IBUs!

Creamy and slow to dissipate the head produced average lacing.  I just love the look of this beer.  The aroma was sugar cookie, malts and some caramel maltiness.  The citrus makes an appearance as does some alcohol.  The flavor was dominated by caramelly sweet malts and a noticeable, but not at all unpleasant, alcohol heat.  The citrus hops are quite mild and the pine and floral hoppiness is present, but basically overwhelmed by the sweet malts and alcohol.

:::APPEARANCE::: dark reddish brown, just like maple syrup, head was very minimal but was a nice thick creamy texture::: AROMA::: I could smell it from 3 ft. away, cherries, sweet and malty, berries, grapes, and citrus hops:::TASTE:::bread-like malt and bitterness up front, then sweet malts followed by a slowly developing hop bitterness that lasts for awhile, despite the citrus hops in the aroma, there were none in the taste:::MOUTH-FEEL:::medium/thin body, syrupy, modest carbonation_____Honestly, I expected better.

Still, when those first snowflakes start falling, this is a nice mug to reach for.  Maybe they could call it Double Elf or Double Santa instead of Double Bastard.","USA","Slipstream"

2664,"2007-12-08",4.1,"Bottle. Ah, the Double Bastard. Ive been looking forward to this since I started to get into craft beer. One of my first craft beers was the Arrogant Bastard. And now, having obtained this, Im quite ecstatic. As I pour this, its a dark ruby/amber with a really nice, velvety light tan head. As I swirl this beer, a cloud of bubbles engulfs the beer about one inch from the surface. The aroma is very intense in grapefruit and hops with subtle hints of banana. There are a darker fruit aroma to it, but I cant exactly pinpoint what fruit it resembles. As I start to quaff this beer, the pine and sharp grapefruit citrus qualities becomes very evident. More subtle notes, such as banana and darker fruits start to appear as the brew starts to pass the tongue. The finish is dry, much like a grainy bread, and a hopsy bitter. The alochol in it is a little noticeable as it warms the chest. This is amazing. This has lived up to my anticipation.","California, USA","BossHossBikes"

2664,"2007-12-06",4.5,"22 oz. Bottle. Pours dark amber with very little head, lacing around the edges. Little bubbles slowly rise from the depths of this brew. The nose is a wonderful sweet sour with a familiar memory invoking component that I cant put my finger on but it smells great. Its like candied apple and raisins mixed with sour malt. When you take a sip the first thing you notice is strong sweet malts as it washes to the back of your throat you notice the alcohol warmth and the hoppy bite. The hops are well integrated and dont come through much on the tongue but they are definitely there at the back of the tongue and they mean business. The hops bite lingers for 30 seconds or more after the drink. The mouthfeel is very full and thick with low carbonation. The entire mouth is well coated taking the sensation to every square inch of mouth surface. Very, very good beer.

It has a rich brown color with a healthy two finger off white head that laces nicely. I smell very strong pineapple and grapefruit aromas. This beer is heavily hopped and that is the primary flavor, but there is malt to attempt to balance the piney and pineapplely flavor of the hops. This is a strong beer and it has a full body to accompany the 10% alcohol. Perhaps Im unworthy, but the drinkability on this isnt too high for me.","Troy, New York, USA","drseamus"

Finish comes out of this with a smooth feel, and sweet malty flavor that is backed by a citrus hop flavor and nice yet bold bitterness.  This is one of the best beers I have ever had.

Foamy, dirty looking white head. Nice retention and only slight lacing. Nose is VERY hoppy still, wow, this is a huge hop bomb. Citrus rinds, hops, pine, grass and a very light toffee backing. Flavor is busting with the hops also, very juicy, with only a hint of backing from the malts. Still good carbonation after the aging, very fun and exciting to drink. Heavily astringent.

Pours a clear deep copper/ambered colour ( not cloudy like some of the bottle descrips.)w/ quickly diminishing eggshell brown head, very little/no lacing. Aroma was a slightly toasted hop sweetness. Alcohol vapours were almost eye-watering! Medium carbonation suspended in a heavy feeling almost barleywine like way. Nice and bitter but the super strong alcohol presence cuts that and substitutes a decent malty candy sugar thing until swallowed then  the bitterness returns.

The best way I can describe my impression was old fashioned medicine - very bitter and syrupy.  I very rarely dump out a beer, but I finished my pint and poured out the rest of the bomber.  Im a big fan of Stone Brewing - the smoked porter is one ofy my stand-bys - this one just did nothing for me.

The liquid is a rather blah amber color.  Aroma is malt and hop heaven!  Smells like dry-hopped with pine, pollen, and grapefruit--mellow, smoothe stuff mostly with a touch of astringence--with dark, rich malts of dark fruits, brown sugar, honey.  Body is full with almost no carbonation: a touch syrupy, enough hops to dry things out suitably with a mouthwatering finish.  Flavor is lovely with lots of hops, lots of malts, and well-blended alcohol.  I taste honey, pollen, roasted malts, pine wood (not sap), grapefruit and milder varieties of citrus as well.  There is some yeastiness that is also in the aroma, a floral bread dough.  Not the best in the style, but one of them.  Reminds me of the Yulesmith ales, but nowhere near as smoothe and wonderful.  Mmmm...good.","Reno, Nevada, USA","0o9i"

2664,"2007-11-17",3.8,"Fresh 2007 bomber.  Pours dark, clear, syrupy looking red with a compact white head.  Aroma is oak, vanilla, strong maltiness, spicy hops, herbal, more vanilla, and something that reminds me of cola.  Smells like a better version of the oak aged Arrogant Bastard.  The hops are more subdued than I would have thought, in the aroma at least.  There is a tiny bit of syrupy malt sweetness in the smell but it is not cloying.  It kind of reminds me of cough syrup but not in a bad way, if that makes sense.  Taste is remarkably drinkable for something that I imagined would be harsh and bitter, etc.  Id even say its smooth.  I had to check the bomber to make sure this was in fact the 2007 release and not an earlier version thats been mellowing for awhile.  Bitterness is fairly low compared to what I expected.  Flavor of sweet, sticky malts.  Medium to full bodied.  Alcohol hidden well.  I think its important to note that the people I was drinking this with said the exact opposite thing as me with respect to everything so it is a major possibility that my palate was shot or something while drinking this and it is a harsh, hoppy, green, young bitter beer.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

2664,"2007-11-17",4.4,"Honestly, I couldnt wait to try this beer and I wasnt disappointed--not even remotely. Stone never fails to disappoint. The alcohol content is remarkably well-hidden in this considering that its 10%. What I like most is that it seems to be a fusion of the Ruination IPA and their normal Arrogant Bastard--a very interesting hybrid. It leaves a very strong aftertaste, reeking of hops just like Ruination, which is definitely a plus--if you enjoy that sort of thing. So delicious.

Nice carbonation, fizziness to it though, as Im guessing from the flavors that this is aged considerably.

Rediculous full flavor of well rounded malts, caramel, biscuit, roasted nuts, molasses, burned creme brulee, pine, grapefruit, and pine...did I mention a large alcohol feel, tingle, and taste.

2664,"2007-11-08",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2008 650 ml bottle from Henry’s Market. This is the winter 2007 release. Pours a translucent dark reddish brown with an off-white head that lasts a fair time and shows some lacing. The aroma is strong and complex with caramel, cola, citrus and hops. The flavor is hops forward with biter hops being the first taste sensation you notice, rounding out the sides are caramel, toffee and cola. The mouthfeel is full, creamy and satisfying from start to end; the carbonation is lively and prickly. The alcohol is well hidden, perhaps a touch shows on finish, but because of effective use of hops it is not distracting. The finish is dominated by more lingering biter hops and caramel. Overall: I love this beer. Gotta’ stock up the cellar, this is a great year and it should age very well. Recommended.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"

2664,"2007-10-19",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 2, 2011 Lacerative is about right. I picked up several 2006 bottles, which was not surprisingly hot while fresh. After almost a year I decided it was time to crack another. Still hot! Whats here so far is AB on steroids, with the same aggressive profile but with less depth than the original. At times it even seemed to border on the one-dimensional, since the alcohol was in danger of occluding the beers other characteristics. Obviously from my rating, I still rate this as enjoyable. But well see what some more time does to this one.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
2664,"2007-10-19",2.7,"22 oz. Nov. 2003 bottling. Pours a rust color with an off white head that fades to a smattering of sheen. Smells bready, yeasty, with plums and spicy alcohol. Lightly carbonated with a sticky, syrupy mouthfeel. Has a fruit juice bittersweet caramel flavor with a strong grapefruit hop and alcohol taste to finish. 
 The Bastard is best quaffed in its original ( and more drinkable ) formula.

Pours ruby with a sizeable head. I look at it and think that it looks like a gem. Nose is more subdued than I would have thought, but certainly isnt lacking. Sweet like a navel orange or tangerine, with some alcohol and hops on the edge. I also get something like cotton candy. Flavor is smooth and rich. Complexities continue for some time. The hops are there in a mature way, but do not overpower. After a few seconds, the softer sweeter side of the Bastard comes out and you get that warming alcohol feeling on your tongue. To me that is where the Double Bastard shows most. There are two sides to the brew that are different, but come together perfectly. Feel is terrific. Smooth. Very drinkable. Even at 10%. Killer brew, man.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","RblWthACoz"

2664,"2007-05-28",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 1, 2007 My 100th rating!  Woohoo!  A 2005 growler of Double Bastard purchased at Stone Brewery (actually got two growlers, one for trading). This beer is hard to find.  It is sold in $60 huge bottles, or at special Stone tastings.  Nice clean malty aroma.  Should I give it a 9 or 10?  Very little carbonation, so little head or lacing.  The combination of trying a 2yr old year, from tap probably makes the carbonation low.  Very little hops in the aroma.  Nice deep reddish caramel color.  Mild sweet flavor.  Medium to mild hop bitterness.  I wonder if the aging has transformed this into more of a barleywine.  Slight alchohol after taste.  Well balanced.  I gave it a 4.3, but should I go higher?  Hmmm, probably should rerate with an unaged version.

Tried the 2000 and 2003 versions on 11/28/07 at Double Bastard day on tap at Stone.  2000:  Very little oxidation. Little head but some small bubble carbonation around the edge.  Mild aroma.  Some malty caramel goodness.  very dark amber. 8,4,9,4,18: 4.3.

Very aromatic throwing malts, hops, dark fruits, citrus notes, with a powerful alcohol kick bringing up the rear. Nice pour looks like the local fermented apple cider with a pencil thin head and minimal lacing, but hey its a strong one so you cant be too upset. Take a sip and it bites you strong and fast a very aggressive mouthfeel with a smoooooth subtle burn. Flavor is right on and then some, hoppy enough to combat the huge malt content.

Has a floral buttery popcorn and grapefruity hoppy aroma.  Body starts full and lightly sweet with a huge bitter hoppy bite with some floral, soapy grapefruit flavor.  This has a strange hop character and some off-flavors that Im not too fond of.Earlier Rating: 3/18/2003 Total Score: 4.22002 bottle rated on 8/25/05: The aroma seems to have picked up some more dark fruity complexity as a result of the age and lost some of its hoppiness.  Lots of sweet dark caramel is also noticeable.  The body is still full and malty with the hoppy bitterness still quite strong, especially toward the sticky, dry finish.  I think this stuff would probably age well for a very long time.

2004 Bottle rated on 5/9/05: Has a very rich, malty, caramel, butterscotch aroma well balanced with fresh piney hops.  NIce viscous sweetness throughout with a powerful bitter balance.  Quite enjoyable.  This might be my favorite vintage to date.

Rerate of 2002 on 4/3/2004: Pours a murky dark brown with a thick cream-colored head.  Strong powerful aroma of pungent hops and thick caramel malt.  The aroma smacked me around and took some getting used to but kinda grew on me.  Nice, thick sweet body with good complexity, very reminiscent of a barleywine.  Even after aging for over a year, this is still a bit over the top and could use some more balance to make it smoother.  Overall a nice bastard of a brew.

2002 bottle rated on 3/18/2003: Sweet caramel aroma with some alcoholic notes.  Smooth caramely butterscotch flavor with a medium bitter finish and a definite warming effect.

It pours a deep amber/copper color with a large, foamy ivory head.  The carbonation is plentiful and the bubbles are extremely small and look like gold flecks as they shimmer to the surface.  Simply beautiful!  The aroma is rich caramel malt, citrus (candied orange), and sticky pine hops.  The flavor is extremely deep and rich and has tons of thick, sweet caramel malt, aged fruit, and heaps of citrus, pine, and resin hop flavors.  No oxidation at all (somewhat surprising since this was one of the big flip-tops and is just over 3 years old now).  The body is heavy and full, thick and sticky.  Extremely smooth and creamy on the palate.  Overall, this must be Stone Double Bastard at its best.  What a treat!  Thank you so much to whoever brought this.  Hopefully Ill be invited when they open the second 2003 3L bottle!
2004 Vintage:  22 oz bottle shared by Lance at the ""IPA/Porter Brewout"" on 2/10/2007...  I consider myself lucky that I was fortunate enough to be invited to this brewout.  Not only did I get to partake in the 2003 Double Bastard, but I has also able to try the 2004 Double Bastard!  Surprisingly, the 2004 hasnt come along nearly as far as the 2003.  It has the same gorgeous appearance, but isnt nearly as sooth and creamy on the palate and the flavors havent melded and mellowed quite as well yet.  Overall, it is still quite stong, bitter, and abrasive.  Needless to say, Double Bastard is still holding to its namesake!  Its amazing how much difference one more year can make...
2006 Vintage:  Draught at Dilly Deli on 12/12/2006...  This was the first time I ever had Double Bastard.  It has the same dark amber/brown color and beige/tan head as the bottled version.  However, this beer is somewhat offensive in its youth.  It is quite bitter (not necessarily in a good way) and the alcohol seems a bit too dominant.  The rich maltiness and nice hop flavors seem to be underdevelped.  Nearly full bodied and heavy in the mouth.  Smooth and creamy on the palate.
This beer is wonderful after several (3+) years of age.  It is a bit too harsh when its still young!  Currently aging in the basement (as of Feb 2007):  1 x 2005 bottle (22 fl oz) and 1 x 2006 bottle (22 fl oz)...

2006 Release - ""Ye Shall Know the Bastard, and the Bastard Shall Set You Free.""
11/06/2009:  Double Bastard Ale...  Aroma:  Vanilla toffee; brown sugar; aged, dried citrus (orange, grapefruit) peel.  Appearance:  Murky, dull brown color; waves of very small, sparkling carbonation bubbles; a growing ivory-colored, dense, foamy head; nearly solid, detailed lacing from the top to bottom of the glass.  Flavor:  Moderately sugar and toffee malt punch in the front; growing dried bitter citrus peel in the middle; ample grapefruit in the spicy and dry finish; the alcohol is definitely obvious in the flavor, burns a bit, and doesnt mix well with the finish; warming sensation; bitterness sticks around for quite awhile.  Palate:  Medium to medium-full body; smooth; creamy texture.  Overall:  Bitterness has subsided, but that was to be expected; this vintage/bottle definitely didnt hold up nearly as well as the 3L bottle had; I am somewhat disappointed overall.

2664,"2007-02-14",3.7,"On the doorstep of 300, we poured the Double Bastard on an evening filled with friends and family. It pours a caramel amber color with a beautiful golden, creamy, cascading head. Fair lacing despite the heads ability to last and last. With 13 people participating in this review, we had all varieties of aromas being noted. Despite the wide spread of scents, we agreed that this is a balanced aroma. Noted aromas were brown sugar, wheat, berries, floral hops, peach/pineapple, cinammon, honey, and alcohol. Initially, the beer is moderately sweet up front, and finishes up with a heavy bitter end which is dominated by the alcohol. Moderate weight in the mouth, it has an oily texture that changes to dry with an alcohol tinge. Overall, this beer is more balanced than the Arrogant Bastard.

3 Liter bottle
Medium pour in a tulip glass
Brewed winter 06, consumed 01/07

Poured a clear ruddy brown and amber with a yellowish beige fizzy somewhat diminishing head with good lacing.

Smelt of canned pineapple, citrus grapefruit with moderate tutti frutti , sucre dorge, and light spruce, pear and banana.

Taste was upfront strong bittersweet pineapple and light gelatin and barley sugar followed by a strong/harsh bitter sweaty spruce and pine with light cinnamon and clove spiciness on a long finish.  Palate was medium bodied, softly carbonated, oily, moderately alcoholic and strongly astringent.

I taste very dark malts, toffee and caramel, and more toffee and more caramel, then chocolate, and lots of dark honey, and dry buckwheat pancakes (like they make at The Original Pancake House in Southfield, MI). Then a bit of licorice in the finish. The hops? Abundant citrus and abundant pine and a zesty spicy bitterness that lingers. As does the pine. Did I mention the spiciness...? White Pepper!

Poured a clear, deep reddish amber with a fluffy, creamy off-white/pale tan head that settled into a thin sudsy, creamy lacing, minimal amount of sticking.

Aromas of citrus, pine, a subtle dark berry fruitiness, caramel, cocoa and clear grainy alcohol.

Good moderate carbonation and a crisp, dry, slick, full bodied, but also a bit airy light mouthfeel, pretty close to perfect for a strong ale.

Some barley wine characteristics, but with a strong ale punch, grapefruit and pine, rind and oily, earthy, fruity, sweet caramelized sugar and roast malts, caramel with a subtle coffee and cocoa, the alcohol is a spicy fusel flavor and provides a nice warming presence in the palate and throat, and a dry grainy, sweet malty, hoppy finish.

Definitely a double bastard, a sipper for sure, but also dangerously quaffable, the alcohol is upfront, but also sneaks up on you towards the end of bomber.","East Central, Georgia, USA","jpm30"

I was going to bring about five large bottles to an art opening tomorrow night and I assumed this would be too extreme for the masses.  But the pour indicated it wasnt a bw, too much lovely  froth and a nose very similar to Arrogant Bastard. I had Arrogant Bastard once and was pleased and surprised by it, finding it to be a slightly improved version of SN Celebration Ale (Im always curious about my ""beer memory"" but  afraid to test its accuracy).

The body is quite full and has an oily texture that slides right down.  The carbonation is soft and small.  It has a heavily bitter flavor with a moderately sweet aftertaste.

Brash, staggeringly sweet, maple-y, pecan-y malt flavor barely has time to register before a punishing pinesap/orange/pineapple trainload of hops derails on the tongue adrenaline rush! Finishes with and intense smokey, herbal bitterness and an ethanol impact as savage as a cat-o-nine-tails. Mouthfeel begins syrupy, creamy, just short of cloying ever so slowly fading to off-dryiness and a tenacious aftertaste of swisher sweets, rasins, orange juice, and shoe polish. Except for the disappointly trite aroma, the beer is actually quite balanced huge and turbulent and scary in all respects, like a mosh pit of fat goth chicks. However, in pursuit of sheer strength, it forsakes finesse and complexity.","New Mexico, USA","maltdog"
2664,"2006-12-07",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 24, 2009 Traded with Jason from Knightly Spirits back in April for this fool, 2005 Release.  Pours a cloudy orange caramel with a one finger yellow beige head.  Aroma is big chewy malts--raisins, brown sugar, some nuts and toasty grain--and some resiny earthy hops.  This actually smells quite a bit like the Old Guardian, but better.  The flavor seems to lead much more to the malts, though there is a bit of earthy hops again.  Im sure thered be more if this was a newer bottle.  Dry alcoholic finish, with some lingering bitterness.Full bodied, creamy moderate carbonation.   I would like to try a fresher version of this to see how differently the hops wouldve played out.  Rerate from Hollingshead Deli, draught.  Hops are definitely more assertive, piny, pineappley, and lightly grapefruity.  Same in the flavor.  Finishes with some alcohol, but still well-hidden @ 10%.  Bitterness was at a 5-6 and dry.  Creamy full body.  I like it both fresh and aged, though I think I prefer the livelier hops. No change in the rating.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

Hops come out in the flavor. LOTS OF HOPS!! Beautiful ruby red color. Decent head at pour, which falls in a short bit after starting to drink. Hops stay on pallate for quite some time.

2664,"2006-12-05",4.5,"2006 bottle.  Pours a dark deep ruby red, clear, with a healthy light reddish tan head.  The nose is vague, not quite overpowering in any particular sense.  It does smell strong, with liberal malt, hops, and a touch of alcohol.  Some fruity flavors peak through, but nothing obvious.  the nose is balanced.  The palate is near perfect.  viscous, low in carbonation.  A bit slippery, mouthwarming, and yet still easy drinking.  The flavor on this brew is truly powerful!  I was worried by the aroma, but this really is a bit more than just an amped up Arrogant Bastard.  Big round full malt, but like an Arrogant Bastard, but sweeter and deeper, with hints of toastiness, and other specialty malt sort of flavors, but none in particular obvious.  The hops are huge on this beer.  As big as Ive seen in a non IPA.  Big piney flowery, and even hints of grapefruit sort of hops, combines well with the malt, and a less detectable than I thought it would be alcohol.  The finish brings out a truly bitter flavor, a tart tangy pine and grapefruit seed only amplified by the alcohol.  The aftertaste is more of this.  Id think this would get unclean tasting, but the flavor is so distinct, that its still quite nice on the palate.  As it warmed, the flavors became bolder, dominated by woody and earth flavors, blending well with the incredible malt and and hops.  I am extremely hesitant about handing out perfect scores in any category, but I really truly enjoyed this flavor.  I enjoyed this beer thorough, and I think Im going to buy a few bottles to sit on.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"
2664,"2006-12-05",3.3,"(2006 bottling) This is unique but I am not sure what differentiates this beer from a Barleywine.  Very deep fruit flavors, caramel and bittersweet finish.

Interestingly the flavor was not as bitter as one might expect given the name and provenance of this beer.  There was a great deal of mixed hop flavors (Chinook was the only one I could pick out) balanced with a fruity maltiness that was almost completely unaffected by the high alcohol content.

2664,"2006-11-27",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2009 Mini vertical with drewbeerme between a freshly bottled 06 vintage and a 05 vintage.  Both pour a reddish amber with a beige head that fades.  The 06 aroma is so fresh, lots of PNW hops pine grapefruit and a heavy malt aroma underneath that.  The 05 lost lots of that hop aroma leaving a strong malty nose that was very reminiscent of a barley wine, very bigfoot like.  Slick and full mouthfeel where you can really feel the alcohol.  The 06 is bitter and hoppy, camel, thick malts, toffee, fruit, alcohol and a piney grapefruit bitterness.  The 05 is similar but all of those malt flavors come to the front, syruppy barley wine like and much of the hop bitterness is lost.  I prefer the fresh to the aged, with out the hops its a barley wine and it needs that bitterness to counteract that heavy malt.  Though I would like to revist this after about six months and see how those hops have toned down and balanced out this beer.

Vertical from 02 to 08. Thanks to drewbeerme as well as pantanap for making this possible.

Double Bastard is big and full bodied. Lots of malts, lots of alcohol, and above average bitterness. There is quite a bit of sweetness to this beer, and at times youre reminded of a flat cola. 

As time goes on, Im noticing more and more spiciness. Theres definite pepperiness from the alcohol. Theres something similar to the aftertaste of a good cigar. Maybe something like nutmeg or even a bit of cinnamon. 

The beer is smooth drinking for its alcohol, and it passes with a fairly long bitter finish.

Pours deep mahogany brown with a big, thick, moussy, lacy, bubble off-white head. You can tell theres an awful lot of unfermented sugar just from the nose--big, thick, cloying toffee-caramel-butterscotch business hits you as soon as you pop that cap. Its really too sweet. By a long shot. The attack is mild, a little velvety on the body, even. Sticky sugars, bitey booze; how much malt did they put in here with this much booze and this much booze food left over? The booze bite is probably sharper than the hop bitterness at the end. I can honestly say I wont finish this one. Too bad.
Draft at Collins Pub. Numbers apply to the draft rating (bottle had merited a 3). Dark ruby amber, crystal clear, thick moussy white head that fades. Huge chocolate, caramel, and vanilla nose. Big thick oily body, minimal carb, super-forward flavors right from the attack. Thick and complicated layers of woody, fruity, sugary, and piney goings-on thoughout the mid-palate, culminating in a dense and clingy finish of pine and caramel.

2664,"2006-11-13",4.3,"Dark mahogany pour, ruby highlights, and a small dense tan head.  Smells of dark fruit, citrus, caramel malt, a hint of spice, and a little alcohol.

2664,"2006-11-13",3.6,"From a 22oz Bottle, 2060 Vintage.  Pours a deep cherry wood color with a well sustaining layer of foamy cream head.  Semi-transparent, beautiful coloring.  Gripping aroma.  A load of citrusy hops bites the nose instantly while drifting in for the first whiff.  Creeping in more slowly gets past the somewhat harsh hops and moves on the reveal some soft white apricot fruits.  Full bodied, heavy mouthfeel with a mild, soothing carbonation.  A touch of caramelly sweetness starts out on the tongue before ending with the expected whallop of hop bitterness.  Lots of malt, lots of body, but the complexity seems to be missing.  Just a lot of crystal malt and piney spruce hop resin bitterness going on.  On the plus side, the craftsmanship is excellent - great body, great head retention, and the alcohol is masked frighteningly well.  Good overall, but the malt and hop characters strike me as rich, but not complex overall.  For my money, I would rather simply drink the standard AB, as the flavors are practically the same, and take advantage of the lighter, less chewy body and increased drinkability.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
2664,"2006-11-12",4.1,"Lots of hops on the nose as well as a molasses sweetness, dried fruits, caramel, and toffee.  Big maltiness and a thin, light carbonation on the body.

2664,"2006-11-12",4.0,"Twenty-two-ounce bottle. Poured a redish brown with a thin quickly disolving head with some carbination bubbles visible on the glass. Strong smell of citrus (grapefruit) hops and some malt sweetness. Its been a while since I had an original Bastard, so it is hard to compare but this beer I think it is safe to say has the best balance between malt and hops out of any of the Bastard variations. Somewhat sticky mouthfeel with a bit of alcohol in the throat as it warms but not overdone. Also it becomes more malty as it warms but still has a hoppy aftertaste that last just about the right amount of time.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"
2664,"2006-11-12",4.4,"Finally! I am able to get my hands on this beer! Bottle. Pours a beautiful mahogany with a nice off-white head on top that is leaving nice lacing. Aroma is fruit, malts, hops, caramel, the aroma is huge in this beer. Definitely a complex aroma. Flavor is a hard smack to the face. Lots of flavors within this beer. At first sip you get hit with tons of grapefruit/hops/pine hitting the palate. Fruit and caramel come in after to help sweeten the beer but not too much. The beer is definitely bitter but it is a very nice bitterness, one that makes the beer extremely enjoyable. You can easily tell from the first sip this is the evil big brother of Arrogant Bastard Ale. This beer is simply delicious!","Des Moines, Washington, USA","asteele8"

2664,"2006-11-08",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 6, 2011 2006 bottle.  Pours similar to the original, dark, deep, opaque, red-brown; head is average, creamy, and somewhat lasting with a canvas color and minimal lacing.  Similar nose but fruitier and stronger; a caramelly, cookie sweetness, dark fruits (maybe plums or prunes), and noticeable piney, resinous, and citrus hops with slight alcohol warming.  Flavor is definitely in your face!  Pine and resin hit first, followed by a nice caramel, cookie-like sweetness with some fruitiness (grapefruit, plum) and vanilla & cinnamon.  Bitterness is high and really takes over by the finish, which contains some alcohol warming and pine and resin which lasts forever.  Palate is soft, creamy and chewy, and full.  Flavors get more complex as it warms.  Interesting and like no other; a strong American with plenty of hops and a slight Belgian strong influence with the fruitiness.  Such a well done beer from such a great brewery and will buy more to age; this is by far my highest rating for a strong ale.  The newer vintages seem to have changed the hops, which clash a bit with the malt backbone.  I aged a 2010 bottle for almost a year and it is more like the older versions with a high bitterness, nice malt complexity and hop notes all over.  Looking forward to this years vintage.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Light beige head was full and creamy with decent retention.  Nice lacing.  Flavor:  Lots of sweetness and malt up front.  Sticky sweetness, that if it stuck around I would not like it.  Fortunatly, A ton of hop flavor and bitterness comes in to scrub it away.  Hops are a tasty grapefruit juciness, pineiness, and earthy resin.  Bitterness comes on strong.  But its needed, and welcome.  Some spice, honey, dark fruit, and caramel also of note.  Lots of alcohol in the finish.  Palate:  Full bodied.  Moderate carbonation.  Some significant alcohol warming in rear of mouth.  Overall:  Not something I would drink regularly.  Im even glad I shared this bottle, because a whole bottle might be too much.

Sweet sugary candy sugar malt nose.  Cocoa and dark fruity notes.  A little cinnamon and cookie mixed within a peppery anise spice rack.  Body is full and strong.  Hmm, let me think...Full and sweet, then the bitter alcohol then the sticky dry alcohol burn then citrusy bitter dry hop finish, then cloying effervescent big burpin lingering aftertaste.  Its a kicker!  Initial cocoa and cinnamon malt sweetness, then the pruny dry bitter middle stands out.  Still get a vanilla oaky, smokey flavor.  Finish is still sweet, but it is played out to a bitter long, coating the tongue piney hop finish.  Which, of course, melds perfectly with the whisky burn and the sticky cooked sugar flavors.  They are arrogant and correct, my palate has been worked over.  Ever angle and flavor was smacked around.  And I still have half the bottle left.  Second glass...More spice in the nose.  More caramel and cinnamon notes.  Maybe not more, but more overt.  More pronounced smokey flavor.  Sticky.  Dry medium roasted coffee notes start to shine through.  Dried fruits.  Slight hint of tart cherries.  This has lived up to the hype.  The flavor is great.  The complexity is there.  The burn is trace.  The finish is lasting.  The effects are blurry.

Just caramel malts, resinous hops, and citrus fruits (grapefruits probably most prominent). This aged barleywine became a very nice double IPA, my favorite of the ""hoppy"" styles.

2664,"2006-05-31",4.3,"2005 bomber. Deep copper-orange pour with a thin yellowy tan head. Nose hits you immediately - brown sugary malt and citrusy hops. The strength of the malt in the nose is suprising. Initially, the sweet maltiness is there, but is bludgeoned into submission by the bitter flower. Still, the strength of the two flavors is remarkable. Slightly syrupy body, and the alcohol is hidden well - you only know it is there by the warming down your gullet. Niiice.","Virginia Beach, USA","Immy"
2664,"2006-05-29",4.0,"Despite supposedly being more ""evil"" than its smaller brother, it is actually much more balanced and better, even if the hops are more assertive.   Big thick malty palate that is right at the line between being nice and being syrupy.  Loads of American hop aroma and taste, well balanced by carame;ly malt flavors.  Nice.","AUSTRALIA","thehipone"
2664,"2006-05-28",3.4,"2005 bottle courtesy of Naven.  Good overall, but I just dont like the hops here.  They come across to me as being very bitter and cloying.  I love hops, but the combination here just doesnt work for me.","Freeport, Georgia, USA","jimbowood"
2664,"2006-05-27",3.7,"2005 bomber - The bastard was taunting me from my fridge, telling me that sure I could handle an Arrogant Bastard, but I didnt have what it takes to down the unruly big brother, double bastard.  So I had no choice but to drink up.  This cocky SOB pours dark brown with a thin head.  The aroma is surprisingly malty given the huge IBUs.  My first sip revealed that though I hadnt smelled them much, there were huge mountains of hops hiding in this dark brew.  The malts Id smelled were completely hammered down by the hops overload.  With 10% ABV well masked, the thick body coats the tongue and leads to a long, bitter finish.  Double Bastard put me in mind of a barley wine thats been hopped all to hell and back.  Its good and I do like big, aggressive beers, but the description is very right about it being ""lacerative"".   Its very harsh on the palate, much moreso than their comparably hopped Ruination, which I love.  My bottle was about 7 months old.  Id suggest waiting two years or more instead.  Give this biggest of bastards some time to settle down a little bit.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"
2664,"2006-05-24",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2009 Pours copper-amber color. Sweet malty aroma with some strong hoppiness- cherry, oranges, cotton candy, maple syrup, caramel, vanilla, pineapple.

2664,"2006-05-21",3.8,"After tasting the Arrogant, or Single Bastard, I wondered for long what made the Double Bastard indeed double. I was hoping for a second helping of malts rather than hops as I found the original somewhat bitter for my taste. The pour produced a clear but deep ruby body topped of a creamy custard head that rapidly disappeared to yield a central column of carbonation. At the nose I found my inquiries to be answered by a straightforward but complex aroma. Sweet rich malts are well balanced by the alcohol and a fruity blend of cherry, apple, berries, and syrupy orange scents mingles with a creamy coffee note. The flavor was a bit more reminiscent of the single Bastard with its strong grapefruit tonalities accompanied by slightly green coffee and chocolate notes. Some flowery bitterness is also noticeable as it joins the finishing bloom of grape juice leading to a smooth creamy aftertaste. A terrific effort from Stone, and my favorite so far.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

It is a bit thick and syrupy.  A nice beer, but I prefer the Arrogant Bastard.  The alcohol was not at all hidden in this.  Definitely worth trying though.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

2664,"2006-04-01",3.7,"I brought a HUGE bottle to a board meeting to celebrate the launch of a startup; I brought it to make the point that a truly unique product can sell at a premium price and does not need to competet with commodities like Budweiser solely on retail price.  Appearance is good ...  a striking copper gold, crystal clear, with a frothy tan head.  Nose is sweet toffee, sweet fruits, and alcohol.  Taste is sweet toffee, dried fruit, cherries, and an alcohol burn; the strong bitterness is not quite sufficien t to compensate for the alcohol.  Mouth is syruppy.  The pieces are all ok, the total package is a little better than ok, but with a bit more carbonation to cut the syrup and less of an alcohol presence this would be much better.

I checked 7 places that had some, at least at some point, and one bottle is all I could I find.  Not bad considering I live in helplessly Stone-less Florida.  Very good beer.  The beer poured out of the 22oz bottle with little head.  There wasnt much in the way of aroma.  Being a Double Bastard I was anticipating double everything youll find in a single Bastard.  Not the case.  Still I found it a very smooth and balanced beer. The only fault I find in this beer, other than its availability, is that it was a little too smooth and subdued.  Not a bad thing at all.  Just not what I had expected after waiting so long to finally get a bottle.  I thought Id get run over by the In your face taste I was expecting.  Great beer.

2664,"2006-03-28",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 6, 2009 2005 Bottle courtesy of Droopy49, you da man. I say this one is a Barleywine, hands down. Pours clear brown with a nice reddish hue. Nice color! Aroma not quite as aggressive as I was expecting, but still pleasant and very heavy on the caramel and brown sugar, with a hint of citrusy hops, and some port like aromas.  Rich thick caramel malty flavor, nicely balanced by a huge hop bitterness. As it warmed, I picked up some fruitiness, almost grape like. Going down, this kicks you in the balls with the warming and hop bitterness, almost like a whisky. This is not for the inexperienced palate, so newbies beware. This should cellar nicely. Id love to see this in 12 oz bottles, because a bomber is a little too much. I can barely type. Good night everybody! 2005 bottle opened on 11-5-09, stored at room tremp: Same appearance, but aroma is of your typical barleywine.

No finish here. the flavor has to die to have a finish. It just keeps going, more like the Terminator. Alcohol is well hidden.

I actually find it to be quite balanced, not nearly as aggressive and harsh as I was expecting.  It is malt-forward with a strong sticky sweetness, opposed by the hop bitterness in the back.  The malt gives some barleywine-like flavors of dried fruits.  In fact, I might classify this as an American barleywine.  I also get some of that same pineapple that was in the regular AB, but very little citrus or other hop character.  Alcohol burn.  None of the sawdust that I found in AB.  Pretty solid beer.

After you have been awed by this beers introduction and its strong demeanor you let this fluid into your mouth to experience an explosion of hops.  The solution is thick and hoppy.

Aroma of resiny hops, toasty carmel, plum, and clean alcohol. Hot on the palate, with a big aggressive alcohol presense. Some carmel, more resiny hops. A bright prickly character on the tongue.

The brew attacks the tastebuds as promised on the bottle...  there was a grapefruit onslaught upfront, backed by a very heavy caramel and biscuity base.  Alcohol is present as a tingly sensation and becomes more apparent in flavor and warming effect on the finish.  Oily and slightly soapy feel from the tremendous hop presence, and a sweet, sticky feel from the huge amount of caramel and fruity malts... clashed a bit at the finish, but worked with some nice synergy at all other points.

The flavor seems to carry some Amarillo hops with lots of sweet components.  Again, I detect lots of things that remind me of a brown ale, but a really over the top brown ale.  Oaked walnuts, maple syrup, strong ""strange"" hops, sweetness.  Its like they made jam out of hops and walnuts.  Perhaps a chutney?  Anyway, this is pretty intense and still quite enjoyable.

Let me qualify that: Ive just started trying craft beers, but of the ten or so Ive tried so far- Yes, a pretty small amount, but so what- This was truly an eye opener. I never had a beer that tasted as complex as the 10% alcohol Double Bastard, and it almost tasted like hard liquor to me, a brandy or close to it. I cant quite describe all the flavors this brew boasted, and while it seemd like a big beer to me, I certainlyt noticed the alcohol, a warm fuzzy feeling almost after the first taste, anmd then heavy malt, many other flavors, but mostly a nice alkie heat. Ill let yall know more as my taste buds develop. I assume thatll happen from some of the posts yall leave, but now I cant tell whether Im tasting big old blackberries, or toasted somethings. I know I like it alot and that Im about to stop drinking Baltica as my go to. This is certainly more expensive, but at 10% alkie, it translates pretty closely to the brews Im used to.

[Dec 11, 2007] <------- of the 07. Okay, I went into this one with expectations this time. Double Bastards sheer strength would not surprise me. This is a very good beer, its very bold and complex. The malts provide a familiar biscuity, caramel flavor, yet also divulge into the vinous, fruity, vanilla territory. Hops are fairly strong on this one. Its a huge beer with a lot to offer, but in the end I cant say I actually enjoy it any more than Arrogant Bastard.

Its one of the better looking beers sitting in the glass that Ive seen so far.Hazy dark brown with an amber red tint, with a thin beige-white head that laces the glass. My first Stone Brew.

2664,"2005-09-03",3.9,"Figured it was time to drink after holding for half a year (if not more). Its late at night, I drank some cheap wine and had a smoke, but I feel confident to make a good rating. 22oz bottle, 2004 release. I think ClarkVV sent this too me in the ""stone"" trade where I got 6-7 of their beers. Poured into my NB worthy glass a shade over 52°. I can smell the malt already. The color is reddish orange, almost a light brown. The head is never impressive and dies down to nothing but a few bubbles quickly. when swirled, the beer just coat the glass. The smell is like a big ol west coast barleywine, a la SN Bigfoot. The aromas are of malt, caramel, biscuts, raisins, turbino sugar, and some spice. Really nice nose. The initial taste is huge, slighty sweet caramel with some hops begging to get in, when the hops invade, they put up an epic fight with the malt. This is a Stone beer and the hops win, but the malt put up a valiant fight. The hops are floral and spicy and a bit abrasive. There is a lingering bitterness. I am not sure, but the age might have helped this beer, was it formally a DIPA? The finish is the hops and some alcohol burn, it is not bad, but I fear what will happen when this beer gets another 10° warmer...This is a big, agressive beer and I can imagine many people hating it and many people loving it, I am not in either of those camps. It is a good beer, but maybe a touch hot and abrasive without the payout another hot beer, Rochefort 10 is giving me.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

It does deserve good ratings due to its nature however, but it wont get good ratings from my taste bud preferences.  The commercial description is great marketing.  Lots of strength in the nose and taste.  Alchohol in both.  Pine, malt, hint of raisin, bitter fruits and hops.

2664,"2005-07-18",3.6,"Bomber into Aventinus glass.  Purchased somewhere in Toledo.  Um, over rated.  Maybe the most over rated beer Ive ever had.  Thats not saying its the worst, or the most disappointing, but Top 50?  Every Top 50 beer Ive had I could understand how it got there, even if my particular opinion was different from the norm, but not with this one.  Glowing yellow brown in the glass, with a yellow egg cream foam head thats thick and forms a semi-solid film on top that is kind of impressive and at the same time almost gross.  Smells like bananas floating in heavy cream with touches of brown sugar.  Good to great racing is perhaps too quick to reach the top to be amazing.  The lacing is a thin glittering film that was for some reason unappealing.  The flavor and mouthfeel are harsh at first, and by that I dont mean strong necessarily, because strong can be smooth or intense and enjoyable.  This was like nettles.  Brashly but uninterestingly hoppy and uninspiringly malty, the unimpressive characteristics were, I guess, well-balanced.  Some flabby sweetness countered the bitterness nicely.  Black pepper in the beginning of the finish.  End of the finish was meally with a bit of alcohol astringency.  Body was medium to full overall and creamy sometines, which I guess was the best part about the beer.  If there were one beer in my experience that I would say tasted like the essence of a bastard liquefied, it would be this one; and thats a pretty half-assed compliment.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

I told them that was the malts and to waft it slowly, to really grab the complex notes. I smell pine or grapefruit, Ah, those are the hops I told them. Now for the taste. Taste like, like, Caramel I helped. And maybe chocolate they added. They picked up some fruit and spice, maybe pepper. Hints of smoke or maybe candy. And, from bud drinkers, that kick was the hops.

2664,"2005-06-19",3.7,"I was surprised.  The first time Id tried the Arrogant one, I should have learned my lesson.  It was a good solid drink, but no Killer Brew.  The same with the other Stone drinks that Ive tried to date. . . Excellent even, but definitely overhyped.  So here I sit with my first Double Bastard.  My aging eyes prevent me from reading all the small-printed bottle Blarney, so Ill content myself with the drinking.  Its a handsome ale, a dark copper with a hefty, off-white fizzy head.  (I wish itd visited longer.)  The aroma is an overwhelmingly strong caramel malt.  Theres a heap of add-ons, but thats the base.  Along for the ride are the usual SB northwestern hops (the emphasis on the herbal and pine), a dried fruit aroma, perhaps some pomes... but its mainly sweet barley malt.  Its quite smooth to the palate, although its almost chewy at the start of the drink.  The flavor resounds with caramel and toffee maltiness, a hint of smoke, a suggestion of yeasty fruitiness, a dash of hot pepper, and a slight taste of alcohol.  Very, very good.  It finishes bitterly, despite the sweet malts that persist in lingering.  When they leave, the alcohol remains on the tongue.  I definitely want more of this.","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
2664,"2005-06-16",4.8,"This was the 2004 edition. Reddish amber, big foamy beige head that ebbed to a half-finger float with lacing all the way down. When you pour this, it explodes in a hazy orange mass which resolves to the big head over clear liquid -- fun to watch. Aroma was lovely, persimmon, raisin, prune, orange, currant, apple butter, sherry, herbs, yeast, malt and alcohol. Taste starts with a blast of floral yet quite bitter hops, then the toasty, earthy, smoky malt comes through. The barley flavor is sweet and grainy, and nearly fruity. I noticed bits of coffee, chocolate, toffee, brown sugar and treacle. The hops were persistent, herbal and lent a bit of juniper. There was a note of oak-casked bourbon even though this wasnt the oaked iteration. For a 10% ABV ale, the taste of alcohol was notably missing. The finish was clean and fresh, leaving a bit of fruity, almost cherry aftertaste. Mouthfeel was good, although slightly thinner than expected. All in all, another great one from Stone.","Toledo, Ohio, USA","noelcb"

Aroma is delicious - grapefruit, papaya, tropical Kool Aid mix and orange blossoms.  Flavor is sour grapefruit, mango and pineapple.  Some maple, caramel and honey account for a sticky, intimate relationship between the tongue and roof of the mouth.  Some stinging citrus shines comes through like orange extract.  Alcohol is discernable.  Thick, full-bodied and f*cking chewy.  Bitter and hopped to kingdom come, with more than sufficient malt support.  Reeks havoc on the palate, with a tongue chafing that continues long after each swallow and into the night.  Finishes with hops and tree bark, like a redwood surrounded by lilies.

Does an about-turn on the finish with sharp hops...very interesting. This beer might not please the technocrats but quite obviously extreme beers have their place. The DB reminds me a lot of of the ultra ripe and equally powerful shiraz from the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale in South Australia.

2664,"2005-01-26",4.7,"UPDATED: JAN 31, 2006  Thank you Liquorama for making this tasting possible.  Ive only sampled this so far.  The pour is very similar to the Victory Old Horizontal.  It is dark brown with an even creamier head.  The aroma is awesome with hops, oak, pine, pineapple, graitfruit and plum.  The malts are very noticeable.  The taste is a 10 plus.  It was so much smoother then I was expecting it to be.  There was citrus, pineapple, graitfruit, bread, hops and more hops, pine, plum, malt, cherry, and I think some Kiwi as well.  This is really awesome.  One of the best beers I have ever tasted.  Arrogant Bastard is wonderful, but now I am spoiled.  Correction this beer appears similar to Arrogant Bastard, but is very different.  I see it as an American Strong Ale and a Barley Wine at the same time.  The beer turns into a Barley Wine as it warms because there is more Brandy in the taste as it goes down.  This is what makes it a classic.

This one definitely brings a big taste to the plate with a sweet fruity malt upfront that settles into a bitter hop bite. This one has a similar taste to arrogant bastard but upped several notches and a few more complexities are thrown in. A very complex tasting beer indeed, maybe having a 3 liter at one sitting can help unravel some of these complexities. Mouthfeel is amazing, full and creamy with perfect carbonation.

2664,"2004-11-25",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 23, 2005 Rerate, 2005 bottle. With another year of beer drinking experience, I feel that I was a bit on the naive side a year ago with my first rating. Not that this is a bad beer by any stretch, it and its little brother (ABA) have really been the definition of the broad American Strong Ale to me. Pours a deep ruby color. Last years bottle had a frothy white head, while this time around it just wasnt quite as nice-looking. Fairly clear, bubbles rising from the bottom of my glass. The aroma was rather alcoholic, which isnt surprising at 10%. Also kind of caramelly, toffee notes. Is that a bit of oak? The alcohol kind of overpowers everything in the nose. Sweet sweet sweet malts, then a kick of hops in the finish. This is a story in contrasts for sure. Bitterness from hops is very citrusy, a bit resiny. Alcohol peeks its way into there too. Good balance between the three, all are potent but none seems dominant. A year ago I loved the sweet malts, but now I think it could stand to be a bit dryer -- its almost cloying (emphasis on almost). Then again, maybe this beer is about excess, which it has in spades, and I shouldnt be so critical. Mouthfeel is on the syrupy side. Very rich and robust, carbonation seemed a bit dull. Alcohol lightens the mouthfeel a bit, buts its still a monstrous beer. This brew unabashedly lives up to all of its expectations, but maybe a bit too much. Certainly a fine ale, but an additional year of beer drinking has put it into a better perspective (I mean, thats the point of re-rates, isnt it?).","Santa Barbara, California, USA","MayorQuimby"

Maybe some slight bitter hoppiness in there.  Transparent ruby garnet color with a big frothy light tan head with lots of lacing.  Start is fruity and vinous similar to a barleywine.  Big booze burn in the middle with some astringency leading into a nice malty sweet finish.  This is another OK, overrated Stone beer IMO.

The peanut shell character goes away and the hops smooth out. This should not be drank green. Oranges and hay in the tase with an aroma of similar character with a few years on it. This pours a light brown and red color with a thin head. The aroma is bread and rotten oranges. Not pleasurable. The mouthfeel is very thick and sticky.

What an absolutlly gorgeous beer to look at,dark red,garnet in the light,small streams of carbonantion, great frothy off white head, that recedes to leave luxurious lacing, excellent..when the entry ""beer"" comes up in an encyclopedia this should be the one in the picture.
Very vineous,toasty aroma,sweet,smells of prunes,figs and fruitcake.
Again quite sweet indeed, to taste but its a dark,slightly decomposed sweetness, like prunes,figs and dark wild berries,after the sweetness a great bitterness,and a warming alcoholic tang.Warming all the way down, but in reality the 10% alcohol is barely noticable.
Exceptional mouthfeel on this creamy smooth and a great warming after taste.

2664,"2004-11-19",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 24, 2006 This bomber (accompanied by a second  making this a pair of doubles) came to me courtesy of clvand0, as part of a great trade.

The beer was poured into my usual goblet reserved for strong hoppy beers of this kind.  The pour looked dark reddish amber in color, and the initially creamy head soon died out to a thin layer of bubbles, and stick lace patterns.

The aroma was very alcoholic, with a good dose of strong piney and grassy hops thrown in.  Mild is not the word that came to mind when my nose approached the rim of the glass.

The taste was very hot and sweet, with caramel, raisins, pine tar, grapefruit rinds, and tobacco juice coming to the forefront.  There was a bit of rubber like off flavor, but I attribute it to the greenness of this bottle.

Sticky and full on the palette, the aftertaste was strangely vacant.  Warming alcohol content set my ears ringing after each sip.  And a sip is about all I could take each time my lips touched the rim of the glass.  At this point in time the beer is not very drinkable, but in a few more years, it ought to be a thing of beauty.
Update
Its been nearly a year and a half since I acquired this bomber via trade, and I read today that this beer tastes best at this age.  My palette has evolved quite a bit since the last time I tried this one.  It is time to find out if this beer has undergone some evolution as well.

The beer came out the traditional color of barleywine, which to me is burgundy with a touch of orange.  The first pour was clear, and had a one finger thick head with remarkable staying power.  Carbonation in the underlying beer was gentle looking but steady.  The aroma was multilayered malts with vanilla, hazelnut, toffee, and chocolate.  Not many hops were detectable using the nose. The taste was amazingly complex as well.  Flavors of chocolate, oak, black pepper, raisins, and mandarin orange were found in each sip.  The mouthfeel however was a little pricklier than I remembered.  Radiating warmth was felt in the belly, letting the alcoholic strength numb away all angst about letting this sit in a warmer than recommended cellaring closet.  I can see this one going a few more years along the ascending path.  Unfortunately no more bottles are left in the cellar to test the theory.  Time for a Chattanooga beer run soon I think.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

So, um, its light and refreshing, just a hint of hops and malt, kinda like some of the other low carb beers on the market...

Oh, wait. Wrong beer.

Okay, this is so vicious that it almost broke the glass as I poured it. Dark brown with a nice head and respectable lace.

Aroma is huge; malt, hops, dark fruits...

Flavor is a bit wimpy. < cough > Seriously, though, it kicks you in the jaw. Very well balanced. I dont know what it is about Browns and Ambers that I hate so much (too sweet/malty) yet this has as much of that and is great. Maybe its the balance, maybe I just cant define it. Huge dark fruits, coffee, some natural spices, and maybe a hint of chocolate, but only a hint and Im likely reaching for something else I cant quite put my finger on.

Palate... Yeah, I used to have one before this. Thick and bitingly crisp if I may coin a phrase. It has some minerals to it as well.

Overall, its damn good, but the hype is real (""you probably wont like this...""). This is an extreme beer and the *last* thing you want to give your PBR-loving friends unless you also like writing obsenities all over their faces when they pass out drunk and give them pure habanaro sauce when they think theyre eating Pace.

Some kind of chocolate/caramel/coffee blend going on but I cant pick out a dominant flavor.  Slightly sweet flavor, alcohol is covered very well.

2664,"2004-11-13",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 14, 2009 2003: Wow!  An intense caramel nose with light citrus hops in the background.  Very enjoyable.  Great color, caramel with amber hints.  The taste is BIG and complex.  Malty caramel (I seem to think this had a great deal of caramel to it), smooth milk chocolate, and light bourbon or wood notes.  The hops are there in the background at first (light pine resin) and the alcohol is noticeable but well incorporated.  Nice pine resin and grapefruit hops and linger and intensify towards the end and finish long.  This is GREAT!  Far superior to its little bastard brother (who is no slouch himself).   
 
Vertical of 2003-2005 (Enjoyed with friends the Weekend of May 13th  After the launch fiasco).  I can not believe I last rated this in 2003.  I love this beer.

2003:  this has become a malty bomb!  Lots of malty caramel flavors layered throughout finishing with a light bitterness.  I did not notice any oxidization in the.  The alcohol is very well hidden and I noticed a plum or date type of a flavor (definitely a fruitiness that I dont normally catch in this brew).  Still aging well though its loosing a lot of its hop punch.  

2004:  this is where its at.  A bit over a year old seems to be where I like this brew the best.  Much bigger aroma than the 2003 (crisp and malty) and the body is lighter as well (due to more hop presence).  At this point I think the hops and malts have integrated fully and this is an outstanding brew.

2005:  The freshest of the lot.  And its definitely hotter.  The hops are much more in your face and the mouth feel is a big more crushing, rather than the smoothness you discover after a year on the shelf.  I may rate this years again, but Im telling you.  I really like this brew with about 1-1.5 years on it.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

That is until you finish the bottle. 
05 version sampled in 07. aroma is loaded with caramel and fruit. Hops are still evident in the flavor, balanced by sweet malt and subtle fruitiness. Long grapefruit finish still intact. This baby has really held up well. Wish I had more because I dont think it is anywhere near its peak. 
07 version is a little less assertive in the beginning, but after it warms for a bit the hops really shine. ABV is extremely well hidden yet again. I have a case this year, so I should be able to cellar a some.

This beer is much more full bodied and round than its little brother.  It does not really have the spikey upfrontness as a regular bastard. ;)  But this is because it is just all things wrapped up in one drink.  FAR more strong booze wise than it tastes. ;)   Unlike ABA, it is more equally balanced between malts and hops, with malts getting the edge slightly.

Not that i didnt like it, i guess i felt if it was double then i was expecting to be blown away with over powering intensive flavors, and if i remember right, i was surprised that it seem mellow in comparison to single bastard.


Fast forward to today...

2006 release. [after several years of double IPA, and other massive ales, Ive learned that double doesnt mean approaching painful, in fact many double IPAs are in some ways more mellow that regular IPAs, the extra malt seems to smooth out some of the edges... same for this]
Pours a similar color to single bastard. dark brown amber, more dense, if not exactly cloudy, nice thick creamy head. sticky lace all the way down.

Aroma nice but not intense, some sweet maltiness, with some spices.

Taste, a full flavored beer, when you let the flavors swirl around in your mouth the complexity of many flavors is what attracts me to these bigger ales. an earthy like flavor [a totally good way]
hops complex malts good stuff!

The Bastard on steroids, with aromas of caramel, choclate covered cherry and espresso hints.  Hints of raisin and plum come through at the end, along with clove and a pleasing alcohol finish. The 100+ IBU's are evident at first taste, then bittersweet maltiness takes over with a nice warming alcohol finish. This offering is imminently more drinkable than it's little brother, which is scary considering the 10% ABV.

Deep red, rich head. Soapy balsamic grapefruit aroma. Sweet and syrupy with soft mouthfeel and cookie malt flavuor.

Still, it is hoppy in both aroma and taste, and, once past the alcohol, it does have a complexity that at least barleywine lovers can appreciate.  Hints of citrus compete with an earthy malt flavor, but the only winner is the consumer.","Indiana, USA","Skip"
2664,"2004-04-18",3.3,"UPDATED: SEP 4, 2006  Merci Psychprof!  Clear copper hue over which lies an off-white head. Aroma is very harsh on alcohol surprisingly so. It took me a while to get over those vapors and get to studying the rest which had a big caramelic malt profile and a fruitiness approaching orange or watermelon. Theres also an earthy/peaty aspect in there, but of course, besides alcohol, the bold hops dominate. In mouth, theres evidently intense hoppy grapefruit juice, caramel, crystal malt and still a moderate alcohol taste. Finish is huge, monstruously bitter, mouth-grabbing, memorable for a while. Mouthfeel is rather thick, closing onto syrup. Definitely worth a try to experiment it, but masochism as they say, is to be consumed in moderate amount. Not quite my bag, give me an Old Numbskull or HOTD Fred if I want a hoppy barley wine. Ill never brush my teeths again.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

rerate - more of just an addition on how great this beer really is.  I got a 2005 bottle from Sean, and I am not sure it was kept very well because it did not impress.

Lots of hops in the flavor, big stong malt backbone underneath.  Flavor notes are hop oils, toasted wheat bread, and something smoky.  Very full flavored,  rich full mouthfeel, this one rides along like a barley wine, nothing less. Not a strong old ale as listed.  This is a barley wine, one which could use a few years in the cellar in my opinion.","New York, USA","DCopperfields"

2664,"2004-03-26",3.9,"Big strong citrusy hop aroma with caramel, sweet thick malt aroma. A touch of alcohol also noticeable. Dense tan head that recedes slowly and coats the sides of the glass very nicely. Roasted malts hit first followed by a quick hit of sweet caramel and then the big hop flavour. Plenty of supporting maltiness and huge bitterness. Alcohol comes to the fore toward the finish before being subsumed with hop flavour and bitterness. Long after you've finished drinking you'll still taste the lingering hops.  Body is quite full with smooth creamy mouthfeel. This one is over the top in all regards. If you like big, strong, hoppy, bitter yet malty and sweet beer, this one is a must. Matter of fact, I think it's a must try although not everyone will enjoy.

If you can't taste the hops in this beer, you'll know your taste buds are 100% dead.  I'd guess the IBUs here are pretty off the charts, but thankfully Stone added gobs of malt to balance things, which is more to my liking.  Put it in a snifter and contemplate it a little.  I enjoyed the malty sweetness of Stone's 03/03/03 Epic a little more, but to each his own.  A touch harsh in the finish and as you work through the bottle, the alcohol burn becomes more noticeable.

Reminds me much of Batch 6000 and as I sip it, the flavor is very similar as well.  Big hops bitterness up front, fairly young, with a strong, velvety soft caramel malt quickly asserting balance.

I considered sharing it with my Brother-In-Law but decided against it (Selfish Bastard). After I made my decision to enjoy it I had difficulty logging on to rate it (Unlucky Bastard). The time is now. Deep garnet red with a slowly evolving, dense tan head. Pralines, candy sugar and citrusy hops on the nose. This beer has a definite beginning, middle and end. Initially, the mouth is greeted to sweet malt, candy sugar, sundried tree fruit and a floral bouquet of hops. Suddenly, an all out piney, citrusy hop attack.

2003 Release: From just the pour this Bastard is screaming “BITCH, don’t talk back or I’ll back hand your sissy ass!” A deep rusty mahogany body with a dense and lofty tan pillow of head. The nose is full of massive amounts of toffee, caramel, grapefruit, and wild berries. Exceptionally aromatic and delightful!
 Sooooooo much malt in the palate! This is a caramelized grapefruit, freaking big brown sugar, that smoky Canadian grade-A molasses, and CITRUS out the BadonkAdonk! Big notes of Plums, Apples, Blackberries, Raspberries, and Apricot, damn good stuff! The palate is very velvety and viscous, hops up and slaps you with a bitter / sweet bite in the finish!

Without a doubt, one of the best smelling beers I've had. Sweet citrus, pine, slightly IPA- very very appetizing! Very smooth, deep citrusy.

MMM very nice beer. Sweet, tangy alcohol- not well masked- but not over the top either, mixed in with what reminds me of caribbean fruits- mangoes, etc.

A little thin in the mouth (carbonation wise- which I don't get because I see it all over the place)- but nothing I can't live with. This and heavy feel.

Curiously weak aroma - earthy, somewhat peppery but its all a stretch.  Thick, caramelized malts paired with a resiny mouthfeel and an earthy, somewhat blood-like metallic flavor.  Flavor is nearly as muted as the aroma - I can't understand this...why is this beer so mild?  Is it some sort of illusion?  Melanoidins develop more as it warms, along with a vegetal component like cooked corn.

It wakes you up with a refreshing burst of caramel hop flavor that begs you to take another sip of tha almighty arrogant one.

I'm struck by the pleasantness of the bitterness, while it is  stingingly bitter, it doesn't come off as bitter/coarse as something like old crustacean.  The malt is so much more supple and firm than in the old guardian, which this vastly superior to.  A touch of medicinal flavor hidden in the alcohol and hop laden flavor.

Solid hop and malt aroma, very mildly sweet, surprisingly mellow and delicate compared to what comes next.  Incredibly strong, bold hop and medium malt flavors, almost overwhelming but deliciously mouth-watering.  Touch of alcohol power, but the finish is somewhat milder, definitely strong but easy and elegant enough to give you a break from the onslaught.  Surprisingly smooth finish, very long and mostly of mature malt and subtly drying hops.  Very serious assault on the senses-- not to be taken lightly-- but not to be taken too heavily either!

Taste is definitely big. Lots of malt. Lots of hops. A medicinal taste in the finish that I think is the combination of the alcohol and hops. Very strong beer.

If you like strong, ""hopped up"" ales, you must try this once. Their label's blatant arrogance is justly backed-up by the quality of the bottle's contents. This is one wonderful, delicious, fun beer. The alcohol is omnipresent, as is the hoppiness that softens up a bit as you sip and allow the beer to warm up a little.

2003 edition: Pours a beautiful amber colour, reminding me more of a good Scotch than Ale in its colour.  The comparisons dont stop there. This beer starts with a fairly mild attack compared to the really bitter stouts I prefer, but the finish is where its at. This beer takes its on sweet time timing finishing. It just goes and goes and this is a good thing, as layer upon layer of flavor evolves on the palette throughout the finish. There are some serious gain elements here and the fermentation really comes through, again reminding me of a good Scotch or Whiskey more than a beer. I really enjoyed this brew (Im also a big Scotch fan too).

One word of caution, this beer hits hard and hits fast. It goes down warm and smooth and then proceeds to make a full frontal attack on your senses. Be in a safe place you plan on staying for a while when you tackle this brew.

Floral and hoppy aroma. Thick, reddish body with small, light tan head with good retention. Cloudy reddish yellow when held up to light. Although classified as an American Strong Ale, this could pass for a Barley Wine. So good that the 10% ABV is not all that noticeable. Very smooth.

This is pure pleasure and make no mistake you will pay by nights end. Pours a deep firey tawny amber brown, settles a bit darker in the chalice glowing of newly created lava from the earths crust as it procedes to grow a tall, firmly thickened, whipped froth of tannish wonder. Fades ever so slowly like a dieing fire to a thin ring and a hazy skim across the liquid leaving massive sticking amounts of webby laced sheets. Aroma appears stronger then smoke, more like heat from an oven with mounting sweet caramel, lightly burnt, earthy crispness of deep woods pineyness. Malts are king in this world, ruling with a mighty pitch fork that pokes at the hops as if to say ""Ha, ha... Try to take my throne you measly weed"". Taste is where it leads you down the path of whats about to become a head full of everything thats tempting. Complexing malts are forest fire big, tons of great semi sweet caramel, thick and thicker yet, flowing in and out of scorched and deeply ripe dark fruityness, pineapple, mango, plum, and raisins bursting within with a light burntness touching everything. Its calmingly smooth and far to creamy for such a fire to burn, but yet it does, and it builds with a wind of hops thats burning up brush of small dwindling pine, dried leaves, and wood. Incredibly balanced bitterness is deep and crackly over the musculature of the big boned skeleton of malts. Alcohol never makes its presense felt til it finds its way to the head where it smokes out any notions of all before it. You remember liking this thing you enjoyed the next day but are now lurking around like a zombie wondering how in the hell did I survive such a dance with the flames of a devil. F*cking great stuff!!

2664,"2003-11-28",4.4,"A nice reddish brown color and off white head start off this much anticipated brew.  Nose is an almost vineous hoppiness...very nice!  Flavor is full, quite hoppy in a very good way, and the alcohol, which is pronounced, both warms the bones and adds a nice extra note to the flavor.  Finish seems to last forever, starting hoppy, but fading into a soothingly warm alcohol bliss.  Really a superb beer!","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","WabashMan"

2664,"2003-11-27",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2004 Bottle. A dark red-brown beer with a good beige head that sits on top for a while. Theres a huge blast of a citrusy aroma (grapefruit). The taste is thick and starts with a sweet malt and alcohol that develops into a tea-like flavor before finishing in a bitter hoppy finish combined with a big alcohol presence. Its very syrupy and thats about the only thing that brings you away from the alcohol. The flavor is complex - pine tars, toffee, grapefruit... Its a very good beer, and I love Stone, but I expected a higher hop level and the thick mouthfeel does detract.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"

The taste, especially the head, tasted like cotton candy.  Very sweet with a real nice, long lasting hoppy finish.  I was very surprised to see that this beer had a 10% ABV.  It hid the alcohol very well.  The only drawbacks with this beer was it was a little too sweet and syrupy and had a thick mouthfeel.  Overall, it was a tremendous beer. I love the Stone Brewing Company, I just wish they were closer to my home.  It is expensive shipping these beers across the country.","Ocala, Florida, USA","mribm"

I only bought 2, but i went back today and bought 3 more.  anyways, i drank this beer to celebrate my 98% on my GIS exam.  This beer is HUGE!!!  one of the most balanced ASA's i have EVER had.  For some reason this brew reminds me of Three floyds behemoth barleywine in all levels.  This beer is awesome fresh and to me, it does not need aging.  perfect marriage of hops and malts, probably the best i have ever witnessed in a strong ale.  pure drinking bliss!!!!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"

Good lacing all the way down the glass.  Aroma tells the story of an abundance of hops and alcohol.  The flavor bites quick with lots of hops, alcohol, and slight orange flavors.

Served from a 22oz bomber and poured into a Belgian trappist-style glass. This one pours a very nice dark ruby color with a medium tan head that leaves a small trace of lacing on the glass.  The alcohol is very evident in the aroma.  Fruits (grapefruit?), malts, and the alcohol are the main parts of this most powerful aroma.  The malts are strong in the taste and it has a syrup-like characteristic.  Grapes and caramel were upfront in the flavor along with a strong alcohol taste.  Almost reminds me of red wine in the aroma ... Great beer.  Loved it.  The description on the back of the bottle is spectacular as well.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","clvand0"

Original</P>The arrogance is unbelievable. Brown-orange in color. Next to no head as is generally expected on a huge beer like this. Nose is strong with both malt and hops. I especially notice a certain fruitiness--pineapple, Id say if I had to guess. Thick as hell with a sharp bite up front that smooths out in the finish. Bitter, bitter, bitter, and heavy. Huge.

2664,"2003-11-16",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 6, 2004 2003 vintage. Nice! Poured a dark copper with a medium tan head. Nose is hops, lightened malt, and some alcohol notes. The body has some oily points to it along with hops, caramel, more alcohol and some grain. The hops were not as over-the-top as I was expecting and the 10% seemed mellow. I guess the hops and alcohol evened each other out. A great beer, nonetheless, and hopefully Ill be able to try earlier vintages.

2004 vintage. Beautiful ruby body. Small tan head. Aroma is strong hops and fruit with lighter malt notes. Pineapple and grapefruit seem dominant. Lighter maltiness as well. Taste is stronger fruit and hops with a bigger pineapple note. The alcohol comes forth a bit as well. The body is medium to full and has a nice, although light, warmth about it.

This one I like alot, and my system agrees. Much smoother and more balanced than its younger rambunctious brother. Very little lingering bitterness. Absolutely Perfect. Hoppy. Yes, but its all up front. Extremely quaffable for 10%. Alcohol very well hidden. This beer deserves to be king of this style. By far. Good job Stone.","Sammamish, Washington, USA","DiamondD"

Powerful malty, hoppy aroma and super fresh. Can also detect a malt graininess and slight fruitiness. Really smooth and syrupy mouthfeel with a nice kick of hops at the end, yet not overly bitter. Chewy and resiny that sticks to your mouth like peanut butter. I detect pineapple in the flavors along with a super blend of hops and malt. This is one fantastic brew! I would almost peg it for an Imperial IPA because it has similar qualities to many I've sampled. As I'm pouring out the last remains of this bomber I can't help but liken the visual to pouring maple syrup on top of pancakes. It looked that thick as it streamed out to the last drop.

2664,"2003-11-14",4.3,"2003 release.  Pleasantly surprised to find one case of this available at Carytown.  According to the Stone website, no specialties make it to this region.  I took 2, leaving the rest for other intrepid samplers.  Pretty deep red with brown tint, decent head, good lacing.  Aroma was a hop assault with good malt underpinnings.  Hint of pineapple.  Flavor starts with a rich caramel malt, followed by a full hop bitterness to balance.  Something vaguely fruity in the finish.  Quite balanced, I daresay.  Very much in a barleywine style vein IMHO.  Stone is really, really good.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
2664,"2003-11-13",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 6, 2004 2004 Release, Sampled November 2004
Wow, this is certainly pungent and fresh smelling, it is a solid punch of citrus hops that is approaching the level of candied fruit.  I get notes of apricot, tangerine, ruby red grapefruit, tangelos.  The aroma is really quite interesting, and before my first sip of this beer, I am going to hazard a guess that this is the best part of this beer.  The beer itself is a brilliant deep amber color that is topped by a creamy tan head.

The taste is definitely not quite as intense as the aroma.  It is full bodied, with a certain creamy fullness to it.  The taste is definitely hoppified, with a nice mixture of apricot, grapefruit, and an astringent herbal character.  This beer is not overly bitter, in fact the bitterness is pretty well in balance, there is a lingering astringency that sticks to my tongue long after the beer has slid down my throat, this seems to be from the copious amounts of hops added.  I am sure this will fade with time, but so will the fresh hoppiness that I am enjoying right now.

There are some notes of hot alcohol in the finish as well, but nothing overwhelming.  This is not nearly as malt dominated as I remember last years being.  Basically this beer is quite tasty, and quite a bit better than I have previously given credit for.
2003 Vintage, Sampled November 2003:
A brown head, that as you pour starts deceptively small and then blossoms in my tulip Duvel glass to about 3 inches (7.62 cm for the non-Americans) thick.    A hazy amber color with beautiful garnet notes when held up to the light.  A malty hoppy aroma, evokes the thought of a sticky sweet hop smell.  Surprisingly, very malty was my first thought upon tasting this beer.  The hops are there, but not over the top and in your face.  This is a thick bodied beer that seems to leave a coating film even after I have swallowed.  Definitely hoppy, the more I sip the more I can detect the bitter finish in this beer.  A syrupy hop flavor hits your tongue at first, and then finishes with a drying bitterness. Rating 3.3/6/3/7/4/14","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2664,"2003-11-11",4.8,"This is one great beer.  It poured a reddish color with a thin white head.  The taste was very hoopy yet extremely balanced.  The finish was clean and hoppy with a nice bitterness that remained.  Outstanding.","Pennsylvania, USA","Prostman"

2664,"2003-11-10",4.9,"UPDATED: MAY 22, 2004 It's beer:thirty here gang. I've been waiting 2 years to try this beer. Let's see if the wait was worth it. 2003 batch. Bought a full case at Norm's in Vienna, Va. Am I worthy of such a beer? Hell Yeah!
22 oz. brown bomber bottle, with a red & white gargoyle painted on it. Poured out a brilliant, clear copper color. Excellent clarity. It had a massive tan head at first, then slid back to a sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. Aromas right away are of sticky, resinous hops. Evergreen aromas, and some grapefruit hops aromas also.
Malts almost overpower the hops, which is a surprize in itself. Very aromatic as far as beers go in general.
Taste: Like a malty milkshake. Very thick mouthfeel. Coats the tongue with malty goodness. Hops bring up the rear, and aren't shy in the effort to overtake the malts. A battle in the mouth.
Finishes hoppy, with sweet caramel malts in the mix. A really good beer from Stone.

...It WAS worth the wait. Good thing I bought a whole case of it.
Next year, I'll buy two cases.


May 2004 update:
This beer has aged well, and the alcohol is much higher than when it was bottled. It's about 12.5% ABV by now, as it continued to ferment in the bottle.
Hops are more subdued now, and the alcohol is overpowering. Cloudy appearance now, not clear as before. Would go really well with a smoked turkey, a filet mignon, or a big ole beef roast. This ain't no wussie beer. It's a manly man beer. Once again, Stone kicks ass.","","Cobra"
2664,"2003-11-09",4.5,"2003 release. A joy to behold as it finally came in, here in desert country. Deep reddish brown hue. Head is minimal but appealing.

Then I jumped about 3 feet in the air due to my unabashed excitement and grabbed a bastard  for each hand. Wow! Finally a double bastard for me to try! God bless this 2003 release. God likes beer. The look of it!! Clear dark caramel, touch of ruby. What a head! tan and swirly puffy, sudsy like all awesome IPA's. Imagine this: my favorite style is IPA and I'm about to take a sip of Stone's coveted DOUBLE BASTARD. Now do you understand the context of this action? Smells like an orchard. Fresh piney hops and citrus notes. Alcohol is unbelievably well hidden...not surprising because of all the fresh, pungent bracing hops. This bitterness however is complemented by the most delicious sweet malt that will make you almost cry and thank stone so much for making a double bastard, let alone an arrogant bastard.","Redondo Beach, California, USA","drinkbeer"

Light alcohol flavor with a hoppy aftertaste and surprisingly sweeter finish.  Warming well hidden alcohol, very moderate carbonation, and a full body make this a winter warmer for sure.

Brings remnants of a fine barley wine combined with a well seasoned IPA.  Palate was very rich, filling and lasting.  Overall this is Stone's best beer!

2664,"2003-11-06",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2003 2003 bottle of tasty Stone brew.  It's kinda like a cross between Arrogant Bastard and Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot.  As others mentioned, it is very much like a barleywine.  This beer seems to be a bit lighter on the hops than its little brother...  Either that, or I'm just getting used to it.  Seems to taste and smell better than regular AB.  More sugar, more alcohol, less hop bite and bitterness.  This evil bastard seems blasphemous as it fornicates with my innocent Rochefort Trappist glass.  Well-masked alcohol flavor that's backed up by spicy aroma of delicious hops and citrusy fruits.","Illinois, USA","zborgerd"

Went to my local large chain liquor store and they sold all 20 of their cases in less thatn a day.

2664,"2003-11-05",4.1,"2003 bottle.  Poured a fiery red-orange, with a light tan head dissipating to an off-white ring of carbonation around the rim of my St. Bernardus glass.  Aroma of caramel, dark fruit, and some citrusy hops.  Flavor leaned towards the malt sideline, with strong caramel, breadiness, and dark, sweet fruits dominating the flavor.  Grapefruit hops with a touch of bitterness were also present.  Alcohol was nicely masked.  This is one sticky beer.  In comparison to Bells Batch 6000, this is definitely smoother around the edges, also having a fuller mouthfeel and malt rather than hop dominance.  The caramely aroma contrasted the sweeter, soylike aroma of Batch 6000.  At this point in time, I can say that Stone produces the most consistently smooth, delicious beverages in the nation.  Still, I can't help but think I've tasted most of the Double Bastard before in their other beers...","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

Like a barley wine crossed with a very bitter India pale ale.  A wonderful meeting of malt and hops.  I love the dark red color.

2664,"2003-11-02",4.2,"Oily looking, orange amber hue, clear and bright in appearance; earthy, resinous aroma, not overly large on the hop aroma, balanced. Sweet at first, with an all most immediate hit of hop acid, evergreen and orange juice, not so much grapefruit, with a wisp of smoky dryness and carbonics on the finish, with the standard caramel/brandy interplay in this sort of beer. Well done, sets a pretty high standard for over-the-top yet balanced American barleywine.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Perkeo"

I smell hops, malt, fruit, more hops, and some more hops--oh, and some alcohol. Good googly moogly! Taste malty, sweet, grapefruit, but not as bitter of a finish as I had expected (feared). Actually, the finish is devine. Amazing how such a big beer can finish so tender and loving. I AM worthy, albeit just barely. I expected a jacked-up arrogant bastard, but what I got was a delicious, balanced brew. This is tasty but not for the faint of heart. I wonder what this 2003 vintage would taste like in a year or so.

Then the aroma of sweet caramel malt with god strong hoppy accents and a hint of alcohol hit my nose.  My first tast was full of sweet and fruity malt with caramel notes  and a good hoppy background.  The finish was slightly sweet but mostly bitter and hoppy.  I took another sip and another and another (you get the picture) and WHAT THE HELL?  All I could taste was bitter hops with a tiny bit of the sweet caramel flavor showing through.  I had to take a break.  After about 5 minutes, I tried it again and....back to the first thing I tasted.  I took a few more sips and BITTER! HOPS! BITTER! HOPS! Man!

I've come to expect that in a stone brew.  The taste is very rich.  A huge maly sweetness that I'm sure is balanced by a large amount of hops that are just well hidden.  The alcohol is also hidden.

Absolutely Divine!)  This 2002 Double Bastard has been sitting in my basement aging for six months - gently, persistently calling my name.  Tonight I weakened and brought this muther of an ale up to savor.  Wow, it's complex, assertive and definitely not for fizzy yellow beer lovers!  This could be classified as a barleywine with its high alcohol content and potent malts.  But the alcohol is well balanced by the enormous flavors and aromas - a magnificent brew all in all.  It all started with a beautiful pour - clear brownish red with a huge, rocky, tannish head which left a nice lacing as it dissipated.  The aroma was rich and full of malt sweetness with a balancing hop spice.  The flavor was caramel, molasses, and coffee along with plenty of the aforementioned hop bitterness to maintain the multi-prong assault on my taste buds.  Though this Bastard taunted and did it's best to overpower me, I found myself worthy of this one and expectant of more.  I'm glad that its brothers await me in the basement  gently, persistently calling me to face them again another day","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"

Hop bitters make an even more impressive reprise in the mouth-puckering dry finish...This stuff leaves an unusual sequence of sensations in the mouth---the initial effervescent bite is washed over by the smooth richness of the main body, which retreats slowly, leaving the aforementioned hop-dryness in its wake---something of a three-movement concerto...No subtlety here, but the flavors are in fine proportion and carried in a body with excellent texture...an unusually successful marriage of intensity and refinement...Double Delicious!","Des Moines, Washington, USA","KingPinHead"

2664,"2003-03-12",4.3,"(2002 release):  Inviting garnet color.  Interesting aroma that has two distinct characters -- the floral hoppy (the first you encounter) and then the sweet alcohol.  In the flavor, the alcohol bite is the first thing you taste, but it's rounded out in the end by the hoppy bite.  It's nicely balanced and it flows well over the tongue, bringing out different, but balanced and seamless, flavors as it moves across the palate.  There's a mild afterburn (though I don't know why I'm picking that up particularly, since it's not the highest alcohol beer I've had recently, yet I'm picking up on the alcohol flavor and character more here than in some other, higher alcohol beers).  A warm, inviting, comforting sort of beer (which I know is not exactly what Stone would want to hear about this beer, but there it is . . . ).","Washington DC, USA","Kathy"
2664,"2003-03-12",4.4,"(2002 release): I'd waited so long for this beer -- first, knowing it was out there, and then finding out that a small shipment was making it to dc, only to find out that the 2 bottles my retailer had set aside for me had mistakenly been sold (it turns out they were sold to daniwerks (and to his credit, one evening he actually gave me a few ounces to sip!)).  Second, I'd asked my brother in Phoenix to pick up three bottles, but when I got out there last month, it runs out he'd mistaken one bastard for another, picking up AB instead of DB (definitely not a member of this site).  Fortunately, Gusler came to the rescue, and provided me a bottle from his cellar.  So after all that effort, did I like what I found?  Hell yes.  Clear ruby body with minimal head.  Aroma is grapefruit hoppy, cherry, flowery hoppy, mildly sweet, rich and inviting.  Taste is a rich amalgam of flavors -- floral hop, grapefruit hop, cherry, toffee, and orange.

Downgraded, though still quite good.Rerate: What was I thinking? An American Original here, yet still derivative. A 2001 bottle straight out of the cabinet at 55 deg. reveals the pepper, vanilla, sweet malt, flavorful bittering hops, and again I swear there is as TAR says, a huge crystal malt presence plus a scottish ale background. Definitely impinges on barleywine territory, but far far better and this is an aggressiveness that I like a whole hell of a lot. Original at 4.0: The malts here give an earthy Scottish peat not found in other American Strongs except for Bear Republics Red Rocket. IMO, this makes it good for, say, cooking a nice lamb dish (in addition to drinking it of course!). Of course, its sweet and bitter in coursing waves throughout your mouth.

Although  a bit unbalanced, this beer is very tasty and very rich. TONS of barley here, but vanilla and sugar overtones make it rather appealing. There is a bit of an astringent smell, but it's hardly detectable underneath all the barley.

The comparison of an aged bottle of Double Bastard with a non-aged bottle and then the average of the two. Still an awesome ale worthy of the few.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"

Huge astringent alcohol bite at first which put me off. however, it develops into caramel, toffee, and a bit of pear flavor. The alcohol fades into the background and there is a nice dose of hops at the end. An excellant brew.

2002: Aroma is sweet, extremely sweet.  Flavor follows similarly, but has the distinctive bastard feel.  Foam dissipated almost immediately.

Full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel. Light carbonation. Long, bitter, dry finish.
Hey, this is a good, not great beer. Not as good as many beers rated far below it... I guess you would call that the Stone Factor. I was a little disappointed.

Clear, bright red color with a rather slight head and little visible effervescence.  Flavor has a nice balance of sweetly fruity malt, piney, lightly citrusy hop and warming alcohol.  The malt is present in enough quantity to render the lip of the glass sticky with sweetness, while the generous hop addition provides an omnipresent yet pleasant bitterness, both in flavor and palate.

The aroma of the hop flowers quite evident along with the fusel alcohol, malt sweet at the back, fresh and a portent of things to come this nose, start is ambrosial, rich in malt with the top a full in its feel. Finish is perky in its acidity, the hops omnipotent and the 10 percent ABV instantly warms the tummy, droughty aftertaste that maintains the bitterness alcohol and hops to the very last. One of the beers I wait for each year, a six pack for the fridge, and a case for the cellar.
Release 2002: 
On the pour a crystal clear deep Sanguineous color with the head majestic in size and frothy in texture with the lace a thick glutinous sheet. Nose is malt; hop floral, caramel, hints of butter and light fusel alcohol tones. Front is ambrosial, the top middling, the finish is devastatingly hopped, peacefully acidic, the aftertaste is beastly alcohol bitter, a major league Belly Warmer to boot"". Oh God, how I love this magisterial brew, its a Jekyll and Hyde beer, good at the start, brutal at the finish.

2664,"2002-03-12",3.8,"Light reddish-brown; aroma of dying embers, toffee, cherry cheesecake, earthy hops; this is thick! thick! thick!.  Similar flavour profile to Bastard but a lot bigger; dry finish with the highest Lovibond crystal malts involved.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
2664,"2002-03-04",4.2,"Deep ruby red/copper. Thin head and lace. Nose of complex malts,chocolate,caramel, and slight fruitiness. Very inviting. Medium to almost slightly thick bodied, chewy malt palate, sweet with fruity impressions,along with  caramelized brown sugar make a damn tasty,full flavored and rich brew. Then you swallow and the hoppy bitterness explodes in your mouth, drying it and begging you to take another sip of this bad ass MFer and to do it all over again. Awesome balance. These guys dont play around, I cannot wait to try the ther other offerings. Gusler...thank you my man!","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
2664,"2002-03-04",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2004 Sweet and malty nose; very fresh-smelling and inviting. Ruby red color. Huge hop boquet. Smooth & sugary. Strong and rather intensely flavored. Earthy, grassy, warm, wholesome, rounded and complex. Heavy mouthfeel. Shovels of tasty hops... but gentle, in a way. Not overly bitter. 'Different,' but very enjoyable.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
2664,"2002-02-25",4.6,"The label for this beer is hysterical. It pretty much says you are not worthy of this beer. It is a fine beer that isnt for the less experiecned. Not the beer to give your Bud drinking friends. Great hoppiness, almost a grapefruit-like bitterness.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","hophead1962"
2664,"2002-02-07",4.8,"A strong ale. I only had it off tap, but my impressions are that its a more refined version of the regular Arrogent Bastard. Slightly less bitter, and sweeter hints of maple.","USA","billybwilde99"
2664,"2002-02-01",4.5,"Wow!  This is a great beer, how do they keep making these wonderful beers?  Cant wait to get back to Nocal - I have one in the cellar and one day Im going to invite a bunch of friends (Im working in Maine, God) and allow them a taste and then finish it myself.  This is meant to be shared.","McKinleyville, California, USA","gwfrankpsu"
2664,"2002-02-01",4.1,"Now if your looking for a beer with a major kick you MUST try this one. Its strong in content and best of all filled with rich taste. The double isnt around always so pick it up when it is. A must try beer!","California, USA","cynthius99"
2664,"2002-02-01",4.5,"This is a great brew by stone.would give it even higher marks but i want stone to keep up the great work.just finished my last double for the 2000 batch and it was even better with a little age.also make sure you drink this at close to room temp.and youll enjoy it!!","El Cajon, California, USA","jonsack3399"
2664,"2002-01-18",3.9,"I like arrogant bastard much better. Even though the higher alcohol content, its not nearly as good....","USA","Brewmaster"
2664,"2002-01-15",4.4,"Its Arrogant Bastards bigger, nastier brother.  A massive load of hops balanced with an equitable load of malts.  With the 10% ABV, bastard is an appropriate term.  What differentiates this from Arrogant Bastard most is the texture of it, as its richer and creamier with the Double.  Very nice brew for those who want 22 oz. of it at a time.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
2664,"2002-01-15",3.8,"well it is good, but it has a taste found in many other beers. still not as good as its big brother the original bastard","winnetka, California, USA","BeerNazi"
2664,"2002-01-10",3.7,"As is typical for Stone; this has the big malt, big hops combination.  Bold toasty malt flavor similar to regular Bastard.  Big citrus and grassy hop aroma, flavor and accompanying bitterness.  Biggest difference from Bastard is the alcohol, which is noticable in flavor.  Same color and head as Bastard.  Good.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"
2664,"2001-12-24",3.4,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2011 Cloudy brown-amber, fine off white foam, bushy herbal bracing hops, bitter caramels, slightly buttery, hints of anise. Apparent alcohol, warming and cutting through the creamy feel of the body. Interesting to revisit -- a see lot in my old rating that rings true while Ive got a different perspective now a decade later. The nearest comparison Ive had is probably from Hair Of The Dog. Thanks, LagunitasFan!


Initial Rating Date: 12/24/2001 3:52:33 AM Cloudy amber. Rich caramels, lots of malt aroma with some new tinge of yeastiness, alcohol pepper and feel, and smack your ass dry hopping getting you in the end. The 10% 22 oz. bottle definitely packs a whallop.  Again, good stuff.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
