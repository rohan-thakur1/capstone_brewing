3974,"2016-10-14",3.8,"500ml bottle pours almost black with medium off-white foamy head. Subtle earthy herbal aroma. Initial very dark chocolate sweetness and orange peel is quickly replaced with long-lasting bitter hops with strong herbal and medicinal characters reminiscent of Amaro liqueur. Refreshing and big, but not overly complex.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","CraftyHare"
3974,"2016-08-02",3.9,"Bottle (500ml) from Beer Cartel, Sydney. Near matt black body (faint reddish-brown hue) with a large dense beige head that settles slowly to a stable film. Big aromas of roasty dark malts and pine needles with more subtle notes of mocha, blood orange, and liquorice. Palate is thick and slick with sticky sweetish dark malty initial flavours before an aggressively resinous dry hop finish that lingers long in the aftertaste. The ABV is hardly noticeable.","FNQ, Australia, ","floydian1"
3974,"2016-06-18",4.8,"Pours thick black with a big brown head. Aroma of piney hops and citrus. Taste is immediately boozy, and it leaves room to pine, malts, tropical fruits and coffee notes. The flavours linger in the after taste, even after a bitter finish. Fantastic ale.","HONG KONG","colui72"

3974,"2016-06-14",4.2,"Bottle from Brewcraft (thanks Kenneth!) at home in new apt. Second or third time I've had this in the past few weeks. Had been on my wish list for a while and it lives up. Dark black pour huge puffy light light tan head. Aroma is big but not huge roasted coffee and malt with fruity white wine hoppiness. Some booze too. Taste is huge - palate rich and smooth but not too thick - sharp bitter pine hops with some coffee bitterness, sweet toasted marshmallow malts, bitter boozy finish that lasts.

Lots of hop and roast malt in the aroma which work together with neither dominating, hops are resiny and fruity, the maly is toasty and there is a rummy element. Taste is dominated by the hops and alcohol upfront then a dry toasty finish which lasts for a long time.","AUSTRALIA","Dervock"

3974,"2016-05-06",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2016 500ml bottle dated 15/11/10, six months old. Pours a gorgeous near black with dark beige half finger that lasts for days. Big pine hop aroma, backed by dark chocolate, a hint of mint, and definite rum amongst it. Hop forward with pine, but dark malt and coffee creep in, herbal alcohol warmth. Quite oily and very bitter, but retaining a smoothness in the carbonation. A big beer, and well balanced throughout. One of Australias better beers for sure.","Osaka, JAPAN","mrjez"
3974,"2016-04-22",3.7,"Draft at Smith Street Taps, Singapore. Poured almost black with a thin broken tan head. The aroma is roasty malt, grassy hop. The flavour is moderate to strong bitter with a big citrus grass hop bitter, light burning alcohol palate. Medium bodied with average carbonation. At 11% you can tell the alcohol is there but its not dominating the beer.","Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA","jmgreenuk"
3974,"2016-04-20",4.0,"10.5%ABV. Double Black IPA.

Poured out black. 40ºSRM.

Nose is has pine and citrus and is refreshing and in a cold callous world is its own kind of reassuring comfort. Nose has more citrus and fruit than pine. Also has very satisfying faint aroma of ripe lychees.

Mouthfeel is thick soap. Palate has deeply roasted malt body with sweet and carbonized flavors combined. Like Ive always alluded to in the past, like burnt char Siew ends or the crispy burnt bits of a glazed roast pork loin. There is also a medicinal heft to the palate like youd get in a quad or a strong Belgian ale. So yes, there is pronounced licorice. This is of course reinforced by a pronounced alcoholic palate, which helps to accentuate the dark stone fruit flavors of the palate, ripe sweet plums, prunes and dates. Hops are bitter and aggressively so, think smoke and bitter melon finished with charcoal. All those IBUs later, Im still loving this full-bodied, well-provisioned brew.

3974,"2015-10-18",4.1,"Pours black, nice beige foam. Aroma is soft, full of fruits and and roasty hoppiness. Building up anticipation before I am able to taste it. Finally I do and taste has strong hops, bubblegum sweetness. Hops are bitter, balanced with the body but still carrying on, almost like a hop liquor. Lingering bitterness, really nice.","ESTONIA","jinroh"

3974,"2015-02-22",4.0,"500mL bottle from Beer Cartel
Looks like perfection - dense tan head sits proudly atop a near-black opaque body.
Intense nose; charred toast, licorice, cocoa, bitter orange/kumquat, pine sap, faintest hint of espresso.
Body is smooth, slightly viscous and slick, yet im hard pressed to figure out how this weighs in at almost 11%!
OH YUM! Malt opens up a bit more on the body; pronounced espresso & cocoa notes, with charred nutty, toastiness, paving the way for big hop notes of leafy herbs, pine, kumquat, ripe stonefruits. Bitterness is firm, agressive, a slap in the face, but theres plenty of malt to keep you upright. Once again, 11%....where?
This beer is diabolical - it shouldnt be this strong, its evil, avoid it, give it to me instead....","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

Biiiiiiig rush of hops, a bit chocolately and some hints of cloves/vanilla. 5/5 on the bitterness (it is very long and persistent finish) there is a slight oily texture but that mellows out the tang from the 11% ABV.

3974,"2014-08-28",4.0,"Bottle, 11C. Pretty pricey, really only succumbed to this because every damned Melbourne bottlo I go to someones banging on about Kaiju!. Black with a largish light tan head that lasts pretty well. Aroma of oranges, orange blossoms, coffee, brown sugar, nectarines, a little chocolate. Smooth oily texture, lowish carbonation is about perfect for me. Clean and bittersweet with loads of oranges, mocha (more dark chocolate than fruity coffee), Australian rumminess, a little pine and some alcohol. Zesty oranges along with firm bitterness at the end. Depth? Not really. Balance? Yes, of a kind. Theres a nagging thought that surely an 11% beer should offer more than a fun whooomp, but its just such a fun beer.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
