2686,"2017-05-26",3.9,"12 oz. bottle shared by Prufrockstar - thanks again, Chris! Going to miss you and Summer. It pours a cloudy dark brown with minimal head, or really next to none, although some off-white bubbles form around the edge for a minute. The initial aroma has a lot of rye whiskey barrel, with charred oak, vanilla, brown sugar, and warmth, along with subtle smoke, chocolate, dark dried fruits, and earth. The flavor is along the same lines, but isnt helped by the body, which is just a wee bit limp and lacking in carbonation. Overall, really nice but didnt hit me the same as regular Adam or a couple other variants.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

There definitely is some bubble here, but as expected (thanks Alan, no seriously, no thanks Alan :-) it is almost still flat. Thankfully the liquid itself is still fantastic... Thick whiskey, raisin, smoke, vanilla and some sweet cocoa that is an odd flavor but still works as a tie to bind the flavors together... Rich aromas are almost what I remember from my minds eye of old skool Adam, but what it would be with a teaspoon of new rye whiskey floated on top... Little nuance at first in the aroma, but it smooths out a bit with warmth...
