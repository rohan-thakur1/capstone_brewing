569,"2016-05-04",3.5,"On tap at Capones. Poured an amber color with a small sized head. Vanilla, woody, very light whiskey (but had to reach deep for it), and lighter fruits.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
569,"2016-04-22",3.2,"ACBF 2016. Poured a hazy Amber color with a small foamy off white head. Aroma of wood, toasted grain, vanilla bean, hints of lemon. Taste is grainy, caramel malt sweetness, lemon, vanilla, and slightly woody.","Forked River, New Jersey, USA","Ed5388"
569,"2015-11-04",3.8,"Pours a clear dark brown body with a small wispy beige head. The nose is sweet with lots of vanilla and chocolate over a caramel malt base and belgian fruitiness. The flavor is very sweet, but I really like it. Its like a vanilla chocolate candy. Caramel sweetness, a little bit of roast. Medium bodied and not very clingy with soft fizzy carbonation. Nice beer, best one that Ive ever had from Boaks. Hard to believe that this was their Two Blind Monks, its a totally different animal.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
569,"2015-07-18",4.0,"Sample at brewfest. Pours brown with a big white head. Leaves a lot of lacing. Lots of vanilla on the nose. I get vanilla and wood on the tongue with a hint of the whiskey. Finished clean. Nice!

569,"2015-07-01",4.3,"Aroma had some toffee and light malt. Deep brown amber. Taste is vanilla with a little Belgium abbey. Not your normal dubbel. Very cool though. Has a slight funk but the sweet takes it away. The ending taste lingers with a nutty brown. Tap.","norristown, Pennsylvania, USA","katrinaez"
569,"2015-04-07",3.6,"Draft. Dark cola with a solid tan head. Vanilla bean is very dominant in both aroma and taste. Tasty but lacking depth. Really nice creamy mouthfeel. If the vanilla bean was dialed back a bit this could be really awesome, but its tasty enough in its current state.","","conway"
569,"2013-02-22",3.7,"Aroma of sour mash, vanilla wafers, fresh ginger and a sour yeast.  Pours murky brown with a medium tan head.  Taste is like sasparilla.  Notes of creme soda, vanilla, gingerbread, and sour whisky.  Almost like a birch beer and Jack.  Very interesting.","Marlton, New Jersey, USA","Jesterdeal"
569,"2012-09-28",3.8,"The Vanilla beans and aging really transform the flavor, mainly by muting some of the Belgian character of Two Blind Monks and replacing them with Vanilla and Oak.  Nice twist to an already nice beer.","New Jersey, USA","HoppityHop"
569,"2012-08-23",3.7,"Draft. Dark pour with a touch of head. Some wood, whiskey, chocolate flavors. Smoother than expected. Aroma is woody and of slight whiskey tones.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
569,"2012-05-15",3.5,"Sampled on draft this beer poured a dark brown color with caramel highlights and a small soapy beige head that faded quickly and left no lacing. The aroma was an absolutely amazing mix of strong caramel, vanilla and wood. The flavor failed to live up to the nose as it was tart, dryish and almost watery with notes of coconut oil and mild earthy and woody undertone and a hint of brown sugar. Medium finish. Fairly full bodied though a bit undercarbonated. Great potential but a bit disappointing.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"
569,"2012-05-09",4.3,"On tap at devils. Pours a slightly hazy, light orange color, thick creamy off white head, amazing lacing patterns with the tiniest of tiny bubbles u can imagine in the foam. Aromas are stong madagascar vanilla beans up front with oak coming in second, bannana, whiskey, berries, figs. Taste is sour, ultra oaky, vanilla aftertaste. Other notes of nuts, berries, whiskey, brett, balanced, so wooded out its insane. Awesome, easily the best I have tried from boaks light bodied for dubbel, and easy to drink.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
569,"2011-06-12",4.5,"On tap at Eulogy.  I imagine that not everyone would like this as it is highly atypical for an Abbey Dubbel, but I loved this beer.  Its exceptionally light; the lightest Dubbel Ive had.  But the aroma is very intense and complex: fruity, with both tones of dried fruit as raisin, apricot, and dates, as well as fresher berry-like nuances.  A deep maltiness is equally present, with a hint of musky tones, and a strong wood presence, but less resinous than some barrel-aged beers.  My friend said she could really taste the whiskey aroma in this one, but I found I it less whiskey-like than other beers.  Less wine-like than is typical for a Dubbel or other higher-alcohol Belgian-style beers.  What really sells me on this beer is how clean and light it is.  I have never had a beer with this powerful and multifaceted an aroma, which is simultaneously so clean and light.  Alcohol is very well-masked, unusual for anything getting up around 7% like this beer.  Absolutely lovely.  And it leaves one feeling quite delightful, I found.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","cazort"
569,"2011-04-27",3.5,"Dark amber/orange with slight haze.  Thinner head.  Rich malty nose with a hint of wine/bourbon.  Palate is clean but a bit thin.  Flavor is refreshing, hint of cocoa, roasty malt.  Was is most apparent is the wine/oak characteristic here.  Its very unique and distinctive.","Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, USA","BiddleBrau"
569,"2011-02-07",3.9,"had a sample at International Great Beer Expo in Secaucus, NJ.  Really interesting whiskey notes, reminds me a lot of Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale.  Really nice nose, and a lot of great whiskey taste combining with the belgian beer.","New York, New York, USA","jdavenp"
569,"2010-12-31",3.8,"Wow, this is a wacky brew.  Pours a bright brown with healthy tan head (on cask at McGraths).  Aroma is vanilla, light raisin, light rumminess.  Flavor is strong oak/vanilla, whiskey, and some blended and balanced abbey dubbel flavors like raisins, dates, and malt.  A light bodied beer that I thought for sure had more than 7% abv at the time.  Very yummy and different.","Providence, Rhode Island, USA","PapaSkeetSkeet"
