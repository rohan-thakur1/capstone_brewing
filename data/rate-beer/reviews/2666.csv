2666,"2017-05-17",4.2,"Bottle shared by Prufrockstar - thanks again, Chris! Im surprised at how deep and dark this one is on the pour, not quite opaque or black, with some amber near the edges, but darker than I realized this beer was. Small off-white head that settles into a ring. Huge barrel character here. Huge. Bourbon is soaked through but not overpowering. Brown sugar, vanilla, charred oak, chocolate, toasted marshmallow, mild roast, dark fruits, and leather. Medium-plus bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sweet, boozy - but balanced - mouthfeel. Really impressive stuff. Nice sipper.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

2666,"2016-12-19",4.0,"An awesome bourbon barrel aged winter ale. Pours a deep black with a brown head. Smells of coffee, bourbon, vanilla and cinnamon. Taste is very thick and surprisingly smooth for how strong it is. Lots of cinnamon, coffe, bourbon, and vanilla in the aftertaste. Had in the bottle.","Portland, Oregon, USA","monk191"

2666,"2016-12-04",4.0,"650 ml bottle. Pours a very dark brown with moderate tan head. Aromas of brown sugar, maple syrup, bourbon, and nutty chocolate. Rich flavors of same; quite sweet with additional oak and caramel malts. Boozy but excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Gerbeer"
2666,"2016-11-28",4.3,"375ml bottle with thanks to boneyardsteve! Pours opaque black, small brown head, dissipates slowly, decent lacing. Aroma is dark sugars, bourbon, vanilla, marshmallow, raisin. Flavor is fully sweet, light plus bitter, decadent, cherries, vanilla, brown sugar. Full body, creamy, fairly low carbonation. Hella good.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
2666,"2016-11-20",4.3,"Bottle. Colour...nearly black with a thin tan head. Nose...Bourbon, creme de cacao, turninado, and oak stave. Palate...oaky, tight and tannic with gobs of Bourbon, dark toffee and burnt caramel. The mid palate is brusk and dry and loaded with dark chocolate and molasses. The finish is long, initially sharp and then soothing with vanilla and marshmallow.","Portland, Oregon, USA","neepsntatties"
2666,"2016-11-20",4.1,"Bottle thanks to Justin. Pours a dark brown color with a small white head. A big sweet chocolate coffee nose. The flavor is big bourbon, vanilla, coffee, sugary. Awesome. Thin palate.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
2666,"2016-11-18",4.1,"Fremont Brewing, Seattle. Draft on release day. Thin light tan foam, dark with a cola edge, letting some light through. Dark leathery fruits, some booze on nose. Smooth sip with alc bite hitting on back of throat. Decent carbonation, fairly lively for abv. Nice bourbon comes in at the end. Heat cuts the big sweet body a nice amount. more subtle flavors than BBAD version. Licorice, sticky vanilla extract, cherry. Big, pretty tasty.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
2666,"2016-10-09",4.2,"Draft pour at Fremont during their release party. One of the first losers on the bottle line equals one of the first winners in the draft line! Took some fun comparison notes in the process, and looking back a month later, Im still surprised about the low availability of these beers. Midnight dark pour with a fading head. Bourbon heavy, and an almost cinnamon spice cookie aroma. Flavor is dense, creamy, bourbon notes, and no shortage of. Vanilla, chocolate, maple. Has it all really. Overall a fantastic beer, but the amount of wait its worth is in question for me. Awesome beer, and the prettier of the two twins if you ask me.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
2666,"2016-09-11",4.3,"Deep mahogany pour with just a hint of head. Nose is the scotch with just a hint of date, Taste is first and foremost is that barrel. The typical bbomb flavors dont hold up as well, some date, raisin, and allspice are present but not very pronounced. Lots of wood and whiskey. Finish is a lot of wood and tobacco. Lightly carbonated, alcohol has a lot of heat. I like it. I get that its really trying to celebrate the (great) barrel and its a nice take on abominable, but it certainly isnt better.","","sebastokrator"
2666,"2016-09-10",4.7,"Draft. Pours deep and rich dark black with a tiny head. Wow, great nose. Rich flavour and bourbon sweetness and chocolate. Smooth yet warming. I prefer this over B-Bad(KDS version).","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiery_1"
