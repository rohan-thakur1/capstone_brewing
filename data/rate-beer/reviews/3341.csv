3341,"2017-03-03",3.9,"I enjoyed my first Lawsons finest beer (Sip of Sunshine) last week, so I decided to ""hop"" at the chance to try their session IPA counterpart. Its got a faint piney kinda citrusy smell. At first sip, I wasnt too impressed. It tasted kind of flat and much like any other session IPA (similar to Bluepoint Mosaic for example) with a smooth but undetailed hop attack. However, after a few more sips, the beauty of this beer revealed itself with some more diverse flourishing of the hop profile and concluding in a satisfying piney, papery, almost pilsnery finish. Ultimately, this is a very fine session IPA, but doesnt really justify the 14-15 dollar price point I often see six packs of 12ozers going for. Still it is worth a try if you like this style or brewery. Goes well with returning to the place where you met the love of your life (and the person you share this beer rating account with)!","New Haven, Connecticut, USA","meccahh69lol"

En bouche, lamertume est définitivement ce quon remarque le plus avec un côté forestier très important. Le corps est bien fait, avec une rondeur pertinente pour une session.

Robust aroma of herbs, spices, anise, orange, and a dank quality. Toasted pale malts under it all. Medium or better body, which was a little unexpected for a Session IPA.

3341,"2015-08-26",3.8,"Lawsons Finest Liquids help pioneer the New England-style IPA and theyve been doing variations on it ever since including Session IPAs. I didnt have the original incarnation, but Super Session #2 seems to follow the form with huge grassy hop aroma and flavor. This is exactly what you expect in a Vermont SIPA.

I poured a 12oz can into a mason jar. It was canned on 8/5/15 and cost $2.10 ($0.18 per ounce). Thanks to Jon H. for this can!

Appearance: Slightly hazy shade of dark gold. Pours to a fairly large, white head of soapy suds  most of which dissipates and leaves a little lacing.

Smell: Huge hop aroma, especially of grass, garlic and onion. Pleasant, but maybe even a bit too potent.

Taste: The New England IPAs are known for being very grassy and herbally, though I say this one is a little stronger than most in that facet. Though it mentions the use of Amarillo hops on the can (which usually create for orange aromas and flavors), I get a hop character of garlic and onion and dried grass. Its lightly fruity for a moment; akin to maybe citrus pith, but then changes quickly to a spice rack taste. A very tingly sensation on the tongue with a firm drying sensation right as it goes down. Theres enough malt to give it both body and balance, but not so much as to give it much distinctiveness (which is fine by me). These flavor components tend to work better in bigger brews (e.g. Heady Topper), but are a bit odd in a SIPA.

Drinkability: The can clearly indicates a 4.8% ABV, which is certainly sessionable, but on the higher end of the Session IPA spectrum. It has the mouthfeel of something lighter, though; its noticeably thin but it is quite crisp and stays well carbonated til the last drop. Its not refreshing, in my opinion, but I could see it accompanying a summertime lunch quite well.

3341,"2015-08-26",3.7,"12 pack of cans drunk fresh over the course of about a month, July and August 2015.Lovely pour, bright and light golden with plentiful carbonation and a rocky white head with good retention.""Fuzzy"" fruit skin, leafy-green amarillo notes in the nose are very enjoyable and backed by a dry, very slightly grainy malt character that also adds a touch of honey. Mild citrus, guava and starfruit notes linger, with a bit of peppery herbs. At no point over the course of drinking these did I find any of the hop notes going South nor any dirtiness/cattiness sometimes associated with the delicate amarillo hop.The flavor is marked by a not-too-grainy (but just enough) malt bill with some softer honey notes with warming and tons of zesty, lightly herbal and citrusy hop notes. But its a more flavorful citrus, less so a bitter, dry, acidic one. Ample, mostly tight carbonation, nicely attenuated, crisp on the end. Maybe a touch more breadiness than Id like, but pretty hard to dislike this thing. Still seems like its trying to be bigger than it is, which is what all/most of the session IPAs are doing (which I hate), but I guess thats a session ale. Otherwise it would just be a hoppy golden ale? I dont know. Clean, refreshing and flavorful, with the hops well-treated.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3341,"2015-08-20",3.9,"Can dated 08/05/2015.
This was poured into a pint glass.
The appearance was a soft semi-hazy yellow to orange color with a one finger sustaining white foamy fingers worth of head. It must last for a good minute and a half before even deciding to dissipate. Lacing was here and there, not much really.
The smell starts off with freshly cut sweet grass, a light lemon, and ever so sly amount of sweet onion. Bittersweet and nice.
The taste follows the smell and bringing a soft sweet oily onion flavor sliding over my taste buds. A sweet onion to grassy aftertaste runs into the finish.
On the palate, this has a light bodied feel with a nice crisp sessionability about it. Carbonation runs appropriate for the session IPA style and hits the spot letting a light bitterness to roll about.
Overall, if treated as a session IPA, it works, but I must admit the IBUs are pretty low in this one. To me, I dig it.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3341,"2015-07-31",3.2,"Pours a slightly hazed, sun-yellow color, with a big, stable white head.

Offers intriguing aromas of lemon zest, hints of orange and a distinct dankness, gently balanced by bready malts. Its exotic fruit notes stand out of the hop profile, highlighting its crisp freshness, adding just a hint of sweet honey. 

Has a very light, aqueous mouthfeel, which leaves a very refreshing impression.

Tastes of juicy lemon, bready, dough malts and a soft aqueous mouthfeel. Hops turn a bit fizzy, due to a higher, slightly metallic carbonation, putting the spotlight almost more on the sweeter turning malts, than on the hops. During the beers finish, crisp lime peel settles on top of the malts, leading to a decent hoppy, but slightly watery finish.

The beer is in fact very sessionable, something I appreciate more and more as of lately, while this pushes it a bit too far. Hops turn present from the malts only for a short glimpse, while finishing too watery, without providing the neccessary body, even for a session ale.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3341,"2015-01-17",4.0,"Snifter on draft at Worthy Burger. Bright shining gold color with lasting head retention. Aroma has a ton of citrus notes with a nice floral character. 
The floral and grassy hints come out during the finish with the citrus upfront. The bitterness is clean and refreshing. Mild dank note hiding in here as well. This is a ridiculous clean, crushable brew, awesome! The snifter was gone in about 5 minutes.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3341,"2015-01-13",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 3, 2016 My Bottom Line:
Potent resins unsurprisingly dominate this Pale Ale, whilst mild honey and citrusy accents create refreshment.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam laces atop the misty golden.
-This is appropriately quenching.
-While this may not be as complex as most of Lawsons portfolio, it is as efficient as can be in its aims.
-Carbonation is bubbly and the mouthfeel is relatively lean.
-The resinous hops take over the finish as well.
