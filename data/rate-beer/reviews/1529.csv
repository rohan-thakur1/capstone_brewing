1529,"2016-02-11",3.5,"Lensemble confère un coté très fleuri à cette bière. Alors bien sur, il faudra être un expert pour pouvoir identifier séparément chacun des parfums de fleurs (personnellement je nai eu que la rose et lhibiscus), mais limpression générale est agréable.

Le nez est demblée particulièrement fleuri: on sent du parfum de rose, et aussi beaucoup le présence du houblon, à travers des fleurs et de fruits tropicaux.

Dans la bouche, le corps est assez léger, leffervescence assez marquée. Le blé procure des notes un peu piquantes, légèrement acides. Les arômes sont la aussi très floraux: rose, hibiscus, et les autres fleurs, que certains pourront peut être distinguer. Grosse présence houblonnée avec des fruits et du bonbon acidulé. Parfois la fleur est tellement présente quon frole le désodorisant en bombe, mais cette impression est restée rare. Le blé est également la.

1529,"2016-02-04",3.9,"6.3%ABV.  Wheat Ale.

Tapped out a gold Amber. 10ºSRM.

Nose has sweet milk and is remiscent of the pink milk left behind after you munch the crunch berries.  Its sweet, but has a nice lactic depth to give it some body.  Otherwise there are sweet ripe fruit aromas of apricots.  Interesting note is that out of the bottle you get a lot more citrus brightness in the nose with yellow grapefruit and oranges.

Mouthfeel is soapy.  There are pale malt flavors of malt shakes, pale wheat toast, cookie dough and raw peanuts.  Overall a  palate that rides very sweet.   This brew also boasts a full-bodied malt palate with nothing beery or lager-like.    Hops have a pleasant spiciness, being closest to Thai basil, which is sweet and spicy. 

Finish is abbreviated and clean.

A good effort.  Makes it to the list.

The floral flavours come through nicely in the finish. Wheat ales are normally not amongst my favourite beers, but this is an excellent piece of brewing.

OCZY : piwo jest dosyć przejrzyste o bardzo delikatnym zamgleniu. Kolor piwa to jasna miedziana żółć. Piana ma grube pęcherze i szybko opada, ma kolor biały. 

NOS : aromat piwa jest bogaty ale wstydliwy i trzeba trochę nim potrząsnąć by ukazał wyraźne nuty cytrusów i kwiatów. Ogólnie zapach piwa przypomina chleb, tarte, miód akacjowy, mandarynki, mango, marakuja, jałowiec i zioła. 

USTA ; piwo jest średnio gazowane ale żywe i puszyste. 
Piwo ma świetnie wyważoną słodkość i gorzkość. Nuty słodowe podobne do tarty. Subtelnie cierpkie o nutach cytrusów i marakui. Gorzkość jest średnia i przypomina skórkę grejpfruta. Gorzkość nie zalega i nawet w posmaku przenika delikatna słodycz.

1529,"2014-01-03",3.7,"330 ml bottle bought at Craftissimo in Tsim Sha Tsui East.
Looks: Cloudy hazy golden honey colour with scraps of yeast sediments; One and half finger head with crumpety white foam which lasts for 2 minutes; Good sticky lacing with very slight carbonation. 

Aroma: Very fragrant sweet ale malt, with fresh grapefruit, passion fruit, jackfruit, honey, flower petals, molasses, orange zest, yeast, light lime and grass.

Taste: Pleasant medium sweet ale malt, with fresh grapefruit, light passion fruit, floral, faint of mango, molasses, resin, light earth and spices, yeast, dry biscuits, strong liquorices, lime and sharp grass.

Body: Close to medium with quite oozy palate.

Mouth Feel: Full on fruity floral hops and flowery attacks, on tiop of a very dry crisp wheaty base. The fruity taste somehow not as intense as the aroma, but still very earthy and oozy. The assorted floral tastes are blurred within the hops.

Hoppiness: Refreshing fruity and light nose, earthy oozy and fruity taste. Liquorices are potent plus sharp grass lead to lasting, really astringent finish.

After Taste: Dry and crisp. Hoppy and bitter to mouth.

Comments: Compare to Mikkeller, I tend to believe To Øl for better brews. This one threw in the kitchen sink and all that, and the result is pretty damn close to the target - very fragrant and refreshing fruity aroma, earthy and oozy palate, rich and crisp at the same time, and really hoppy - its only drawback is the somewhat low-fi fruity and flowery taste. If these are fixed itll blow your mind away. At this level, its still a good one to enjoy, only couple steps away to perfection. Enjoyable!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

1529,"2013-05-25",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 6, 2014 330ml bottle (Drink Shop, Tallinn) (7:3:7:4:14=3.5)
Lovely fruity fresh floral crisp aroma - indeed, spring is here. Pale hazy orange, brief small head. Taste follows the aroma closely, some more grassiness and fattiness from hops. Palate as crisp as youd hope for, and the 6.3% is nowhere to be seen - I can believe people would session this. Nice long bitterness, but of dry resininess. Some slightly soapy aspects to the floral finish. All round good golden-ale, not saying so wheaty to me.

Very similar to the bottle. Head more persistent, more viscous  Plenty of lacing. Got to bump the score up - I like the look.
