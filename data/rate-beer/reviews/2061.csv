La bouche fort strict livre Ã  lÂ’attaque ses saveurs balsamiques accompagnÃ©es dÂ’une sensation acerbe qui fait penser Ã  la prunelle sauvage. Milieu de bouche fort rond quasi liquoreux et madÃ©risÃ© laisse lÂ’impression de manger un sucre dÂ’orge qui colle aux dents.

Manque beaucoup de moelleux.
