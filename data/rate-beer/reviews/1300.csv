1300,"2016-05-22",3.2,"Cask at Chesterfield Rail Ale Jolly with RB crew; clear yellow pour with a frothy white head, biscuit malt aroma and red fruits, taste has robust malts, and a hint of fruity English hop action.","Birmingham, West Midlands, ENGLAND","RichTheVillan"
1300,"2016-05-20",3.4,"Handpull cask from the Regal (JDW), Cambridge. Mid-gold with a loose and clingy white head. Grapefruit and pithy lemon aroma with a hint of washing up liquid. Bitter taste with a soapy astringency in the finish. A trifle messier than Oakhams average golden, and part of me wonders why 87% of Oakham beers are of a similar style. But taken on its own merit this is worth drinking.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","jjsint"

1300,"2010-12-31",3.8,"Cask at St Albans BF 2010.  Been waiting ages to try this.  Pale gold.  Twards the end of the barrel.  Quite ascetic hop aroma but just right side of sharp.  Yes not a lot of condition, makes a difference.  Bu the hops are indestructable.  Hoppy, sharp and palate dancing.  Hoppy as hell.  Lovely sharp and bitter beer.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

1300,"2010-11-04",4.2,"The Pub, Leicester. Brilliant gold, uneven white top. A beer in rare condition. Stewed green mango, lemon zest, pissy toilet rug aroma of huge beauty. Still, creamy, shot through with soft tropical pink/green fruit-aromatised cream, harshened with grapefruit and nut husk. More bollocks and balance than Mikkellers single hop IPAs. Honeyed white toast and cashew. Getting very close to total beer.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"
1300,"2010-11-01",3.9,"Cask (gravity) - Norwich Beer Festival 2010. Poured with a medium sized & lasting fluffy white head. A nice & bright golden yellow body. The aroma is fantastic, loaded with grapefruit, lemon sherbet & peach with an underlying creamy strawberry cheesecake quality about it. Lemon zest & a brilliant though subtle pale malt sweetness leads to a piney, grapefruity finish. So crisp & hoppy, light bodied & superbly quaffable. Finishes slightly dry with a great length to the end. Really fantastic, Im still waiting for Oakham to put a foot wrong.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","sm89walt"

Really good.","Wigston, Leicestershire, ENGLAND","leaparsons"
1300,"2010-10-16",3.3,"Cast, The White Hart, St Albans. Pale in colour.  Childish aroma, think Lilt/Um-Bongo.  Fruity blast on initial taste, sweet at first followed by bitter lemon.  Dry finish.  A grower that packs a punch...(fruit).","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Ale_Imp"

1300,"2010-10-07",3.0,"Cask, gravity, at Bedford Beer Festival 10. Gold with a white head. Coming to the bottom of the cask by all accounts. Gentle citric hop aroma with a hint of oats. Sharp, soapy citric hops in the taste. Despite Bedfords much-lauded power cooled jackets, I thought this was a bit warm.","Bedford, Bedfordshire, ENGLAND","hughie"

1300,"2009-08-31",3.5,"UPDATED: OCT 20, 2010 Cask conditioned	Handpump	Peterborough BF.  A golden coloured beer with a whitish head.  The aroma is nice and hoppy with lemony notes and a bit of soap.  Tastes quite big with good citriicty from the hops, and again a little soap.  Perhaps over malty which I never thought I would accuse an Oakham beer of being, but its tasty enough.
