1749,"2017-01-02",3.4,"Bottle shared by bhensonb. Pours golden brown with a modest off-white head and a sweet malt aroma. There is a watery smoked mslt flavor with a dry slightly bitter finish.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
1749,"2017-01-02",3.7,"Bottle shared by bhensonb. Pours light amber /copper. Not much white head. Taste is crisp with a light bitterness. Nice but not much to it","sacramento, California, USA","oRos"
1749,"2017-01-02",3.5,"Bottle from Craft Beer King. Pours copper with a beige head. Caramel aroma. Near med body. Flavor is caramel with noble hop. Nice, but not exciting.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1749,"2016-04-17",4.1,"(Bouteille provenant de Bottlecraft): Des malts biscuit, un bouquet floral expressif et une touche dérable. Le corps est fabuleux, difficile de croire au taus dalcool.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
1749,"2016-02-26",3.6,"22 oz. bottle. It pours a clear deep orange color with a fluffy, khaki colored head. The aroma is dry and toasted with a subtle woody character to the malt with some black currant and floral hops. Mild hop aroma, but its there. The flavor is very smooth, toasty and dry with some nice soft, sulfury lager yeast notes. Terrific balance of yeast, hop and malt. Almost too drinkable. I couldve downed three of these no problem, but at $7 a bottle its pretty pricey for what you get.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
1749,"2013-01-23",3.3,"Bottle thanks to GT2. Light toffee colored pour. Nose and flavor bring caramel and light spicy hop profile. Drinkable, but to be expected for a <4% brew. Definitely a Vienna and true to style, but not really captivating in any way. I could crush a bomber, but I didnt really love the stuff.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
1749,"2013-01-16",3.1,"651mL thanks to brainlair. Pours a clear, orange with soapy, white foam. Okay to weak formation and soapy lacing. Nose is celery, tomato, whole wheat cracker, German malt, some soap. Taste is lemon detergent, some oil, mild wheat cracker, strange. Palate is densely malty, light grassy bitterness. Feels extremely German, but not necessary complete, fresh, or very good.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
1749,"2012-03-26",4.2,"Copper pour, clear and bright, with a nice white head.  Fresh field-grass hops, wholesome biscuit-like vienna malt, and a touch of nutty caramel in the nose.  Flavor is hearth-baked bread, light caramel and spice, with pleasantly herbal hops layered throughout.  The malt is not like modern bread ... but a little more coarse, like hand-ground grain straight from the earth.  Body is light, carb is creamy, with lingering but mellow bitterness in the finish.  Rustic, charming, and wholly rewarding after a  day of outdoor endeavors.  This beer is like a firm handshake from a well-trusted friend ... 3.8% seals the deal ... simple, honest, and true.","Wilderness, WA, USA, ","brewolf"
1749,"2012-02-07",3.7,"A bit of a dry finish. Perhaps I shouldnt have tried this for the first time whilst sick. Anyhow, my least favourite out of the Heater Allen beers Ive tried - but that says more about the quality of HA than this beer - which is not bad.","","keenanrobbins"
1749,"2011-12-25",3.7,"As always these guys hit it on the mark once again.  Beautiful wet grass filled nose, hints of German malts.  Wet at first on the palate, moving into a bittered grass note, and ending with a soured barnyard touch, all blending very well.  The aged bitter note is beautiful.  Quite a nice representation of the Vienne style!","Earth, Washington, USA","skoisirius"
1749,"2011-11-16",3.4,"Bottle.  Reddish with a thin white head and lots of lacing.  Fuller flavoured  than you would expect.  Rather speedy and soon gone finish","Munchen an der Willamette, Oregon, USA","troopie"
1749,"2011-11-03",3.4,"bottle.  3.8% vienna, thank you heater allen.  clear light chestnut colored body.  light grassy noble hop notes in the nose with a toasty / biscuit vienna-like character.  light body and thinner than it should be, so its a bit out of balance and has a watery feeling to it, and the malt is rougher than the other Heater Allen lagers.  grassy and green flavor with an herbal tea nature.  pleasant and interesting but ultimately its just simple field beer, and doesnt match the quality of the coastal and the pilsner.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1749,"2011-09-10",3.8,"Shared with Strykzone via Facebook Chat.  Pours a very clear light amber with a good sized white head. Nose is a very clean smelling caramel malts with some grassy and floral hops and some light fruit.   Body is medium and the mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth. The flavor is mild, yet flavorful, with a hop character and finish that delights the senses. Shows you can make a lower alcohol brew that tastes good if done with tender loving care which this one was obviously was.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
1749,"2011-09-09",3.7,"22 oz. bottle from Hayduke as part of our open trading series.  We shared bottles via facebook chat.  This had plenty of yeast sediment on the bottom of the bottle and fortunately I rolled mine.  That caused considerable haze in the orange brown beer.  A light colored tan head was one finger and never completely left.  The nose was soft sweet fruit with caramel.  Those were also tasted.  The fruit was complex and sweet.  Very nice.  Bready caramel and soft bittering hops.  The finish brought out some gentle spice.  This was very subtle and very well brewed.  A credit to beer craftmanship, especially when that 3.8% ABV is considered.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
1749,"2010-11-22",3.6,"22oz bomber that I picked up at Belmont last Saturday.  Pours a clear bright light amber with a orange/copper tint and decent size bright white head that is medium to loose in bubble size and settles down to a small loose layer.  Bright lightly malted nose, ample amounts of grassy hop, some light orange and caramel.  Crisp and light in the mouth feel and ample carbonation.  Some bready malt, touch of caramel and bright grassy hop character.  A touch vegital but still enjoyable to drink.","Washington, USA","bvc"
1749,"2009-03-11",3.3,"On tap at Horse Brass. Nice clear amber pour with a nice bone-white head. Nice malt and bread aromas and flavors with a bit of a hop grassiness. Not a bad beer, but probably my least favorite from Heater-Allen so far.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","Beardface"
1749,"2009-02-16",3.7,"On tap at Baileys taproom. Dark copper pour, good clarity, with a smooth white head. Excellent maltiness up front. Toasted malts, caramel, and a touch bready. Hops were grassy and gave the beer a slight pilsner-like crispness. Clean and really well balanced.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
1749,"2009-02-12",3.5,"Tap @ Baileys Taproom...  Poured amber with a white head.  Aroma of malt grains.  Smooth, subtly carbonated palate with flavors of malted grains and caramel and/or toffee,  A little hop bitterness for balance making this a very drinkable brew.  Grainy, biscuit-like finish.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
