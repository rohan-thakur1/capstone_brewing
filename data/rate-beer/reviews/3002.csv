Almost odourless, hints of grain and hop if you sniff hard enough.

Not a lot to say about the taste really, typical cheap lager/pilsner nothingness. Just a wet liquid with hints of hops and alcohol to keep you going. It did however get a little bitter towards the end of each sip, not that it is a sweet tasting beer to start with.
