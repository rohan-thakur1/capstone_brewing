1064,"2015-11-22",3.4,"Bottle. Pours a clear pale yellow-amber, with moderate carbonation. Aroma is sweet pear with hints of lemon and straw. Flavor is semi-sweet, with some tartness. Pear and lemon, fairly light but surprisingly good palate feel for something so light. Probably the best perry Ive had, not that Ive tried many.","Bothell, Washington, USA","michaelinwa"
1064,"2009-02-05",3.4,"Bottle from Bottle Barn. Cork has ""06"". Slightly hazy pear juice color with very little head. A pear aroma much like lightly sweetened canned pears. Medium almost body with really sprizy carbonation. Flavor is pear and wood. It isnt dry, but it seems to finish that way. Really pleasant to drink. There is a slight astringency that develops with time.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1064,"2008-07-22",3.7,"2004 Bottle. One of the best Perries that I have had to date. Pours with a medium sized rocky white head that covers a relatively dark (for a perry) chill hazed yellow body. Aroma of pears, plastic, and a bit of wood. Taste is very clean of pear and caramel. Very sweet, but not cloying. Slightly syrupy and lively carbonation. Could drink a lot of this as it tastes quite light. Perfect lunchtime drink.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1064,"2008-01-11",3.7,"Pours almost clear, the color of Bartlett flesh. Highly carbonated, explosive and fun in the mouth. Straightforward pear and clean--like biting into a ripe pear or eating killer gelato. Slight astringency.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
1064,"2008-01-07",3.9,"Hazy greenish-yellow colour.  Fresh pear nsoe with some light wood character.  Crsip and light but with complexity...leather, pear, vague nuttiness.  Very refreshing - born for crepes.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

Employee Tasting Notes (Belmont Station)--Slightly less alcoholic than the companys apple variety (3% ABV), this cider drew our interest considerably more. Made from fifteen different kinds of pairs, it possessed a pleasant and refreshing finish.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Angeloregon"
1064,"2007-10-28",3.6,"750 ml bottle
I found this at a store near my new house.  Given that I wanted something light and a change of pace it seemed like a nice option.  At $5.99 the worst case was that it turned out to be very average and I would never get it again.  I doubt Ill buy another bottle but it did exceed my expectations.  When you are not in the mood for stouts, porters or IPAs give this one a shot.
Aroma / Appearance - The transparent golden body was graced by a short lived white head.  Active carbonation danced from the bottom to exit the top.  The scent of musty pears was mixed with a slight funk.  Overall it was not very complex but I found it ideal.
Flavor / Palate - Pears form a very tart and abrubt impression on the tongue before passing.  It reminds me more of fruit juice than beer which would make sense given that it is only 3%.  This is a beer/cider that you could drink all day without too many ill effects.   On the other hand too much of it might get a little boring.  If you dont think you want to drink it all find some friends and open a tasting with it.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
1064,"2007-07-07",3.7,"In the 750 mL bottle from Beertopia. Pours a pale yellow with a fizzy white head that disapates rapidly. Aroma is to die for: intense pear scent and perhaps a faux smell of honey. Thin body, but a large bolus of sweetness blows over your tongue that is quickly followed by a blast of medium-intensity tartness that leaves the tongue just slightly dry. This is delicious, but I would prefer to see it go to a greater level of fermentation, reducing the keen sweetness and increasing the paltry 3% ABV.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","SledgeJr"
1064,"2007-07-07",3.6,"Wow!  A pretty golden beer with just the right amount of fizzy bubbles to help anyone who drinks it realize this is a special one.  The aroma was like a love poem written in a secret dark cellar.  The flavor moves us from the cellar out into the sunlight - beautiful pear flavor, with supporting citrus and floral notes.","Nebraska, USA","kitschy"
1064,"2007-05-24",3.4,"Aroma is a bit funky.  Flavor is like a nice baked pear tart.  Very nice blend of sweet and sour.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","RCL"
1064,"2007-05-23",3.9,"Enticing light gold color with a touch of effervescence.  Aromas of sweet rotten fruit with a hint of barnyard (not in a bad way).   This tastes amazing: sweet pears, vanilla ice cream, and honey.  Finish is a touch cloying, with a sensation on the palate reminiscent of eating fresh pears.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","DMRz"
1064,"2006-10-26",3.2,"Head is initially small, fizzy, white, fully diminishing. Body is light yellow (with a faint pink tinge?). Aroma notes of apple and apple peel. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Medium body, watery texture, fizzy carbonation. Would like this a little drier, and with some wild yeast character for interest, but its nice and clean.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1064,"2006-10-26",4.3,"750 bottle. Cider is cloudy, light caramel gold with a teeny tiny white, bubbly ring of a head. Sparkling wine-like carbonation trails drifting up to the surface.<P>
Cider smells amazing! Heavy notes of pear, light note of apple; Moderate horsey note, damp spicy wood, aspen sap.<P>
The flavor is juicy sweet. Moderately-to-heavily sweet, moderately dry/acidic finish.<P>
The body is light, the texture is velvety and the carbonation is tenderly fizzy.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","luckygirl"
1064,"2006-08-02",3.8,"Doesnt smell much like pears. Has the color though and lots of floaties. On closer inspection, I believe the floaties are pieces of the cork.  Pretty nice cider actually. Not too bubbly.  An expensive, but rather tasty cider.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
1064,"2006-06-27",2.7,"Faintly bubbly pale gold pour. Musty, woodsy nose of mushrooms, shy pears and herbs. Rather inexpressive compared to their fantastic apple cider. Subdued attenuated pear lets a light earthiness through in mouth. Low-medium carbonation, light body. Rather dry product, but without the charms and subtleties of the apple version.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1064,"2006-06-09",2.9,"Sample from the bottle (750 ml corked) at the Mondial de la Bière, 2006.  Very pale yellow with no bubbling, head or lace, rather still and dull....faint aroma of old, somewhat tired pears, cinnamon and a bit of rotting wood....fairly dry, clean, subtly farmy character on the tongue, mostly fresh apple-pear flavors but also a touch of spice and wet grassiness....moderate, soft, even carbonation....pleasant but pretty dull; the apple cider from this producer is vastly better.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1064,"2005-06-11",3.2,"This is not supposed to be a gourmet item, and its not.  But it is a pleasant, drinakble country poire.  Taste is a little sweet and a little fruity, distinctly tasting and scented of pear.  Cloudy light gold / straw color with huge and unattractive clumps of yeast floating in the glass.  Explosively carbonated; cork blows as soon as you release the wire cage, cider sprays ... so be careful opening it.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"
