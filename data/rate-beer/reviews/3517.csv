Somewhat mild aroma with chocolate malt sweetness and a very faint floral hop presence. Earthy, soily hops followed by light toast, caramel and toffee. Not much else happening. True to style but not very exciting.

Light body thats pretty watered down with faint earthy/grassy hop character countered by slightly toasted light malt sweetness. Grass, pine needle and faint resins followed by caramel, toffee and chocolate sweetness. Somewhat true to style but kind of one dimensional and boring. Hops could be stronger for an American interpretation and the mouthfeel and malts presence could be more interesting for a British version, especially on cask.

Aroma has a strong toasted malt note, reminiscent of cigar leaves, mild grassy hops and a strong biscuit malt ending. Flavor has a very strong cigar leaf-like toasted malt note, very low chocolate malt in the middle that adds a light sweetness, grassy hops in the middle and a biscuit flavor that finishes out the brew. Body is very thin, almost water, with low, fine carbonation that accentuates the mouth feel typically found in the styling. Very nice lacing is left on the glass from this brew as well. Overall a very interesting brew with a very unique tobacco toasted malt flavor. A very solid brew.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"

Biscuity malt is really full in the nose and just a twinge of roastiness. Pleasantly light in flavor but not at all watery. This style does wonderfully on cask. More carbonation might make this come off as too thin. Finishes w/ a mild bitterness.

Little to no head.  The body has a brownish red hue.

Mostly malty aroma, caramel & chocolate, toasty, solid. smooth, creamy. Nothing jumps out, but it isnt supposed to.

Taste: Its all about the smooth, and its all about the malt. Hops are here, and higher than other milds, (25 IBUS, if I remember right), and you can just taste them on the tongue, but theyre playing it cool, too. Crisp malt flavor, judiciously applied, lies right underneath every gulp & swallow.
Body is medium light, not anywhere near watery, but surprisingly thin for a Surly brew. Well, this, I guess, is their notice to us, saying, ""Watch out, dont categorize us, we can be boring, too!""

I cant help but like Mild, its easy to drink and easy to enjoy, and the malt profile is tasty. Theres just enough flavor to make you happy. And yet, it wasnt designed with my palate in mind, for I keep wanted a bit more...I keep missing the Belgian malts of Bender, or the hop attack of Furious. I got that from my customers, too. Many had a sample and went back to Bender...or Furious. 

Nice low, languid finish, malts hang tight on the tongue and the deliciousness sticks around. 
I take back what I said. This is not a boring beer, just a bit more mellow in flavor than their usual entries. Thats one thing I dont think Surly is capable of: brewing a boring beer. I dont think, like any true artist, Todd has it in him to do so.
Mild does serve a nice niche, though, and I hope to see it again in the future, ...but not at the expense of Furious or bender!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

3517,"2008-01-19",3.0,"Tap at the Blue Nile. Only having tried one prior mild ale I wasnt quite sure how to rate this one. I cant really rate to style because the only other mild Ive had was absolutely nothing like this beer. I know... mild ale is a broad and vague category, but I have to echo Nuffields comments that is well more along the lines of a bitter than anything else. Surly has never been known to brew to style anyway. Whatever. 
 Pours a nice looking dark amber/copper with a frothy white head leaving moderate lacing down the glass. Aroma of lightly toasted biscuity malt and subdued grassy hops. Creamy and leaning toward flat on the palate. Almonds, toasted caramel, salt water, spicy rye bread on the tongue. Underwhelming at best.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"

3517,"2008-01-18",3.5,"On tap at Happy Gnome. Bright brownish red color, some lacing. Medium bodied. Smooth on the palate. Flavor is initially dry nutty malts, followed by a hint of underlying sweetness. Basic dry hop finish. Has that underlying soft Surly quality, but Im not sure what to attribute that to, be it the water or yeast or whatever.  So yes, this beer isnt mind blowing. It shouldnt be. It is, however, a solid session brew. Ironically, Surly came out with a ""weaker"" beer after coming out with a number of big delicious beers. I say for the style, this is well made.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","WisconsinBeer"
3517,"2008-01-17",2.7,"I was told by the bartender that this is 4.1% abv--not *exactly* mild as I know it (I tend to like it around 3.5, maybe 3.8%)--indeed, if it is 4.1%, it begs the question of how I distinguished this beer from an English bitter.  There are a lot of similarities: theres a strong nut note driving this, but the overall profile is marked by the mildly sweet maltiness producing fruity qualities, esp. raspberry.  The underlying profile, when I could dig it out (served too cold), suggested La Folie.  Yes, thats right, La Folie.  Only, not really because youre dealing here with a very subdued beer that is marked more by its notable carbonation than its elegance of composition.  Deep red/maroon/amber in color.  Basically this seemed more like a bitter on carbonation than the milds I loved most in England.  But then, mild isnt a distinct category.  Only, the best milds I had were essentially lunchtime stouts, rich brown/black with complex chocolates and roastiness.  This brew is forgettable, aided only by the good reputation of this fine brewery.  (on tap, The Happy Gnome)","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

3517,"2008-01-17",2.9,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2008 Tap at the Happy Gnome.  Fairly clear body of damp red hue.  Weak and very sweet aroma of sugared red fruits and candies; with warmth a very earthy presence of pungent mulch, wild rice and wet grass begins to develop, eventually to fester into something rather unpleasant.  Flavors of chewy toffee and rock candy, of the type that ought to glaze the surface of a dense chocolate malt and belgian sugar body, sit restively without much substance beneath.  Hints of almond butter, lighter types of frosting, raspberry, and pear.  Light to medium bodied in the mouth, briskly carbonated and quite dry; hollows out with the drying, pasty kick of wheatgrass in the finish, leaving a very ambiguous impression.  It isnt exciting, nor is it especially sessionable to my taste given the extremes of sweetness and tea-leaf dryness that start and finish it.  Other examples of easygoing, flavorful beers fulfill this standard of substantive simplicity more amiably and with a lighter touch; it certainly isnt the fact that Surly chose to take a laid back route with this beer thats unsatisfying, its that their representation of this style isnt very accurate or compelling.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
3517,"2008-01-16",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2017 Original rating, 1-16-08. Called ""Surly Mild"" at the time: Two pints on tap at the Happy Gnome in St. Paul during the official release on 1-16-08. Sweet, malty aroma features cherry, light chocolate, and apricot scents. The smell is weak but nice. Pours a hazy maroon with a bright amber hue and a small amount of beige head. Cool, intriguing appearance. Malty taste, but not nearly as sweet as the aroma suggests. The heart of the taste comes in the yeasty finish, which features bread, cardboard, sesame seed, and other spice flavors. Medium body (heavier than I expected). Smooth and crisp in the palate. Easy to drink and sessionable. If this werent called Surly Mild Ale, I would have considered it an amber, but a good one. This is about what I expected (and I had cautiously high expectations): Surly has taken a rather boring style and made it interesting and tasty. If the folks at Surly wanted to go the mainstream, accessible beer route (which they dont, thankfully), they could probably get this on tap all over Minnesota bars; Surly Mild Ale compares favorably to, say, Summit Extra Pale Ale. Is this a mind-blowing beer? No, but it is a damn fine effort for the style. 6/4/7/4/15=>3.6. Re-rate, 3-13-17. This time called ""Surly Nitro Dodgy Geezer:"" 8 oz. pour, on nitro tap at the brewerys taproom in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Consumed on 3-5-17. Pours a medium brown, almost maroon. Moderate to large amount of cream-colored head. Even head. Great color, great head, looks superb. Cant ask for more. Malty aroma. Chocolate covered pretzel scent. Simple smell, stronger than I expected. Certainly not bad but not a lot to the aroma. Strong pretzel flavor. Quite pleasant in taste. Nicely and heavily toasted malts. Good, toasted malt finish. A lot of flavor for the style. Light body. Aqueous. Insubstantial. Actually not awful palate effects by nitro standards but of course worse than carbonated beers. I quite enjoyed this.
