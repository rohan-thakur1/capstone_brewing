Mikkeller glass makes it impossible at first to swirl the beer to test regeneration. Subsequent investigations reveal however a reasonable propensity for head regeneration, which also reveal more herbal and spruce aroma notes. Oily texture, medium carbonation, medium to light body and a subtle, lingering finish with aroma notes. Flavour is supremely balanced and far too easily drinkable almost to pay attention to the individual flavour components. Kinda blows your mind. Flavour is citrusy at first proceeding into a rather bitter experience on the palate that mostly fades on a dry note with not a lot of residual sweetness left to wash it away.

This beer smells floral and fruity. Lovely light citrus, pineapple and mango for intense sweetness. Earthy pine that is not heavy and does not stand out past the other scents. The malt on this nose is a light sweet perfume. So wonderful how all Hills beer has this quality of lightness both in the nose and in the drink. I think if I had to summarize Hills trademark as a brewer I would do it like this - He is trying to put the hops in the beer and leave them on the vine at the same time. He has a way with hops and in this beer they are so fruity and yet so light on the palate. Thats his other trademark, the light malt that is so light its like the beer wants to just float out of the glass. Crisp, light sweetness like a floral nectar, a bit of light sweet cracker that has exactly the perfect balance. The beer has a resonance rather than an aftertaste and its a light floral fruitiness. As the beer warms some sweet grass and pine comes forward and this is just a lovely beer.","New York, USA","pinkie"

Light malt sweetness and a touch of light caramel add just enough balance and character to prevent this from being just a mouthful of hops. Not that its too acidic by any means. Tons of simcoe juiciness, with all kinds of citrus complexity from all the C-hops. Soft and supple on the palate with no alcohol or flaws.The draught versions seemed a little less ""juicy"" and soft, with more hop bitterness apparent. Probably the increased carbonation levels (and both draught samples were rather hazy, adding some dullness from the sediment).

Consumed from a Tulip poured fresh on tap at Hill Farmstead Brewery in June 2012. 

A: Pine notes, pineapple notes, grapefruit notes, powerful tropical notes in this WORLD CLASS nose! 
A: Pours a hazy orange with finger-width head and lots of lacing.
T: Follows the other-worldly nose, plenty of hop flavor, but not a ton of bitterness on the back-end, malt profile manages to live up the hops, but not a whole of lot of the biscuity malt profile thats more common to the style. 
P: Smooth with plenty of carbonation, this beer is EXTREMELY quaffable, extremely.

Pours a slightly hazy light golden color with a nice bone white head that persists forever. Wow that aroma has got lots of hops in it for a Pale ale! Juicy citrus and pine with a hint of green onion and a touch of bready malt make for a wonderful smelling beer. The flavor is loaded with pine and citrus with a bit of sweet malt to back it up. Flavorful bitterness, but never harsh. Medium to light body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a bready resinous mouthfeel.

Pours a hazy yellow with a big head and good lacing on the glass.

The aroma is hop forward, not insanely pungent, but nice... lots of leafy and floral hops, some pine and a good citrus rind character. 

The flavor is very bitter, wonderfully so... it is also fairly dry... I keep thinking that this beer is akin to De La Sennes Band of Brothers, not in as much as that the beers taste alike, but the philosophy behind them seems to match up, ie. not holding back on bitterness, letting the hops do the talking, but at the same time never becoming anywhere close to astringent, unpleasant, or otherwise disagreeable, & maintaining dryness and low gravity. The hop flavor is layered, and in its own way multi faceted. There is a nice leafy character that is present just enough to be delicious without becoming annoying or overbearing the way that this flavor can sometimes do in hoppy beers. The bitter citrus rind and grapefruit are central and mild notes of pine certainly peek out from time to time. The malt is not particularly ""on display"" but it is very clean and a mild honey note does shine through. 
I guess Im in the ""cool kids"" club now.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

The beer appears mostly clear and orange in color. For some reason, my pour was more transparent than others. Interesting.

The aroma brings an array of pleasant hop and citrus notes.

The beer is very flavorful and enjoyable. Light on the palate, and effortless to drink, this is only one of two growlers that enticed me enough to go back for seconds that evening. Well balanced and delicious. By well balanced, the hops play the lead role, but the various citrus and hop flavors meld together harmoniously.

The feel is a bit on the thin side, but at 5.2% and packed with flavor, Im OK with that.

I definitely recommend this beer. It would be quite easy to throw back a few pints of Edward.

You dont have to try too many Hill Farmstead brews to start expecting the best when trying something from them. And, with that, this is probably the best, or certainly one of the best, Pale Ales Ive had. Its aggressively hopped; citrus, grassy notes, but perfectly balanced by a sweet malty body.

4020,"2012-02-29",4.8,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2012 Unfiltered, honey-colored pour with a thin white head.  Tangerine, pine, tropical fruit funk, and nicely floral nose.  The yeast is amazing, and you can tell they have great water.  Flavor is earthy, full of mango/apricot, and is wonderfully balanced by firm malt and just enough resin.  Ample but soft carb carries the flavors through a fantastic medium-bitter finish.  Sitting very lovely around 5%.  This just works for me.  It has proven to be, far and away, my favorite pale ale.","Wilderness, WA, USA, ","brewolf"

4020,"2012-02-03",4.2,"A Mes rate. Tap at Lord Hobo.Ugly as a tired old slapper who hasnt put her teeth in. Milky, dirty yellow brown with just a wisp of white head. I feel bad marking it down for something that really shouldnt matter but all i can do is be honest. Thankfully, once this little gem reaches the olfactories, its nothing short of sublime. Perfectly spiritely, bright and floral and aromatic. Its a real feast for the senses. It has an earthy Nelson Sauvin on rye character about it. Just a lick of resin, perfect bitterness and the yeast sings like an angel all the way through. Epic citric notes, orange and tangerine all over the place. Balance, poise, finesse, its got the lot. Other than the looks... Shit the bed.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

Nose is booming with fresh piney hops, a wonderfully intense hop bouquet. Palate is crisp, clean, finishes with a nice bitterness. Flavors of biscuity hops and grass notes, the hops fill in the background with light pine and floral notes. Could easily drink this everyday with no complaints.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","SuIIy"
4020,"2012-01-09",4.1,"Served on-tap at Als of Hampden into a nonic pint.

A - Pours sunkist orange with a nice thick one finger tall white head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving spotty lacing down the glass.

S - Lots of strong, grassy, citric hops blend in well with the bready malt to form a nicely balanced nose. While the hops dominate they really never get too out of control. Good stuff.

T - Nice grassy hop bite up front giving way to a mix of graham cracker malt and grapefruit flavors from the citric hops. Finish is a bit chewy with plenty of lingering bitterness. Having had quite a few of the hoppy Hill Farmstead offerings now I would have to say this one is near the top of the list. Glad I finally got to try it.

M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. A mix of pine resin and chewy malt in both the feel and finish.

D - Awesome stuff. I really enjoyed this one quite a bit. The strong hop punch was very nice, as was the lower ABV, but the slightly chewy feel brought it down a notch. Still very drinkable tho.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

Nose is massive white grapefruit with accents of kumquats and citrus bitterness.  Flavor is similar- just an explosion of white grapefruit and kumquats all over with accents of lemon and maybe some loquat as well.

Bottle:  The aroma consists of mild grapefruit with some faint fruity caramel and fruity sweetness.  It pours a hazy amber with some sediment and a small creamy off white head that leaves some spotty lacing.  The flavor starts with a quick dose of tropical fruits.  Theres a touch of caramel in the background.  The finish has moderate grapefruit.

S - Light hoppy bitterness, lots of pine, slight floral and tropical citrus notes. Very mellow but still lots going on, just the way I like my IPAs.

T - More hoppy/bitter then the nose suggests. Pine, tropical citrus, slight herbal/floral notes that really adds nicely to the bitterness. Not overdone or trying to be an IPA, its just right and exactly what I want. Light hoppy, slightly floral finish.

M - Light, crisp and refreshing, perfect carbonation, clean finish.

O - As far as APAs go, this one is really hard to beat. Its amongst the class of Alpine Hoppy Birthday and Russian River Parking Violation, my two favorites.

Pours a very hazy light apricot color with a good white head and a pretty good amount of lacing as it goes down the glass. The nose simply explodes with hoppy notes ranging from tropical to citrus with a bit of floral and pine in there for good measure. Simply a cornucopia of all that hops can do to a beer. The taste drives this up to the next level--simply awe-inspiring. Wow, so good. There really isnt any hint at all of malt, other than that it adds a bit of a base so the beers not too thin. It is quite dry, however. Dry finish with a very resiny, bitter finish. So much flavor in a 5.2% pale ale. I simply love this. One of the best beers Ive had in a long, long, long time.

4020,"2011-04-06",3.8,"My first tango with HF is Edward. I sense the beginning of a wonderful romance if this lives up to the hype. Poured lovingly into a pint glass from a shapely HF growler.

4.5 A: Hazed orangish brown color. Two fingers of off-white creamy/frothy hybrid head. Retention is very good and the lacing is leaving no glass exposed. Cant get much better than this.

4.5 S: Hops are quite floral and citrusy, with some grassiness in there as well. Grapefruit, pine, and some mandarin orange. What is really amazing is how well the yeast is controlled. For an unfiltered pale ale, this is magnificently clean. Just a small touch of bready yeastiness.

4.0 T: The taste is much like the nose: clean and hoppy with excellent yeastmanship. Grapefruit and pine are a bit stronger than in the nose and work with a moderate hop bitterness to please the hopheads palate. Hops can be described as resiny. Touch of neutral sweetness from the malt to balance the bitterness and a smaller touch of bready yeast.

4.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation, very good for a growler. Reasonably creamy and super smooth.

4.0 D: I have doubts that labeling this a APA is appropriate, but I dont doubt that this is a great beer. Very drinkable as I got through half a growler very quickly. The hop flavor is good, but the impressive aspect is how clean the yeast is. Not the most complex of brews, but worth a drink.

4020,"2010-10-11",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 4, 2014 My Bottom Line:
Spicy, grassy and orangey hops flourish within this American Pale Ales dry and effervescent mouthfeel, leading to leveled wooden, resinous hop bitterness and much merriment.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A tower of foam settles atop the cloudy amber.
-The citrusy perfume is not one-dimensional as it can be in a lot of APAs. This ones decorated by many grassy, spicy tips. It also shares many tropical fruit notes such as passionfruit, mango, etc.
-The frothy carbonation and relative dryness make this poundable, while making it reminiscent of some Belgian brews too (some De Dolles, for example).
-Malts contribute subtle sugary angles and crunchy biscuity flavors to support the hop verbosity.
-This is superbly drinkable yet never short on flavor. Wonderful.

How: On tap many times and at many places in Vermont, including directly at the brewery.
The look: Partly cloudy golden-blond body topped by a persistent small off-white head
In long: Great bright hoppy nose full of grass, pine-tree and tropical fruits.  The clean and crisp toasted malts offers a perfect amount of caramelized and honey.   The body is full but it is so crisp that it feels light.  Lots and lots of pine-tree, oranges, yellowed grass, tropical fruits.  Bitterness is in the med-high range and the long finish is also quite dry.

Every time I drink this beer I like it a bit more and now it is one of my favorite American hops thirst beer.  So I read that this beer is named after the late Hill grandfather and the brewery is located on his land.  That is very cool and respectful of the brewer.
