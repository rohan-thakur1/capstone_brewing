Aroma is sweet, both fruity and...something else, grainy?... with boozy undertones. Wow, very dense creamy mouthfeel. Quite starchy, with apple fruit undertones and a very boozy finish.

1585,"2012-11-25",2.8,"750ml bottle, shared at a family Hibachi dinner. ABV labeled as 18% on the back. Bottle was chilled, and shaken well before served into tiny white ceramic shot glasses. The waiter offered me a wine glass for mine, I accepted. Either he guessed that I like to take notes on appearance, or they ran out of ceramic thimble glasses, Im not sure. Creamy milky off-white color, like condensed milk, but clearly not as thick. Leaves a lot of residue on the side of the glass. Ricey, kind of a boozy nose. Kind of a sweet smell. Desert-like, like rice pudding. Bigger body. Thick. But not sticky. More dry. Rice pudding aroma. Not really any carbonation. Light alcohol burn, kinda sweet. For the ABV, this is surprisingly not bad to sip.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
1585,"2012-11-15",3.2,"This pretty cobalt blue bottled sake from a bottle shop poured a large sized head of clear colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind an uncarbonated hazy milky thin colored body. The strong aroma was of vinous polished rice. The vinous mouth feel was tingly and vinous at the start and strongly tingly at the finish with a vinous aftertaste that ended in a typical Sake vinous alcohol bite. The flavor contained notes of polished rice in a vinous alcohol noticeably strong finish yet one that was not of the typical burning alcohol one expects from a Sake. The second glass was noticeably more milky after being shook up with a much thicker milkier palate.  A decent one that I would consider buying again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

1585,"2009-01-24",3.4,"Served at some local Asian place.  Appearance is completely rice milk, a bit awkward that way.  It has some visible specks and solids as well.  So, a bit chunkier than the one other Nigori that I have had.  Aroma is lots of alcohol with grassy berries that are a bit plastic.  Taste is pretty bare bones with alcohol and a light  sweetness at the end.  Seemed overly plain.  No alcohol burn but plenty of alcohol essence left over. It did grow sweet as I ate my spicy food, so it paired well with that.  Leaves a thick residue on the glass.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
1585,"2008-12-21",2.9,"With an SMV of -12 you just know this is going to be sweet, as a nigori should be.  Plus, SakeOne is trying to appeal to an American consumer base, and so far, we tend to like our sakes either dry and boiling hot (a shame) or cloyingly sweet (also a shame).  Still, I really liked what SakeOne did with their Murai series, so I wanted to try their other brews, including this, the Momokawa Pearl Junmai Ginjo Nigori Genshu.  A mouth full, to be sure.  As a nigori should be, with the lees pressed into the final product, its a very cloudy sake with a sort of transparent luster.  Shining in its cloudiness.  The aroma matches, light and bright, with a nice dose of peach amongst overtones of alcohol and fermented rice.  The palate is also unsurprisingly thick, weighed down by the particulates, but also enriched by the creamy texture.  It sits and settles on the center of the tongue, like a portly monarch to his undersized throne, radiating sweet flavors: cherry, peach and a big of a cough syrup burn.  A lovely medley of flavors, save for the medicinal burn.  After that, the alcohol sweeps onto the palate, enjoying its own allotted share of time, but doesnt burn intensely enough to be incendiary.  In its wake is a discernible but pleasant trail of alcohol.  Thus, this nigori sake is sweet and straight forward, alternating between some nice, bold fruity flavors and a fierce alcohol.  Good introduction to nigori sake, Id say, but lacks the subtlety that, say, the Murai sake series had.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

The flavors are fruity and quite sweet, kind of like coconut milk, it is in no way like that but sort of reminds me of it. Very full mouthfeel, almost chewy, but considering the amount of stuff at the bottom of the bottle very understandable. At 18.5% the alcohol is noticeable, but balanced by the fruit sweetness.

The banana and melon add to strong vanilla flavor - more fruity than ricey in my opinion.  Sweet but it becomes tangy and almost sour at the finish.  Strong alcohol finish.

1585,"2006-06-21",4.0,"750ml bottle: Pours to a thick-looking creamy body similar to coconut milk but it looks a bit less creamy and more watery with a slight yellow-earth hue.  Its packed with tons of large and small white particle matter that sticks & coats the outside of the glass when swirled, almost like chalk.  The aroma is definitely sake, but its much more fruity than others - showing some coconut, tapioca (as advertised), along with some sweet rice, sugar cane, alcohol-soaked pear, and light earth.  The taste is a brief flash of sweet coconut milk and pear juice as soon as it hits the tongue, but this is almost instantly transfored into a bitter rice, earthy mold, crisp apple seeds, vanilla, and some mild allspice.  The sweetness of the particles comes through in the finish with more watery coconut, and rice pudding notes.  The palate is very interesting - silky smooth, but definitely thick and creamy, coating the mouth without feeling chalky at any point.  This is quite different and is really a treat.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

The aroma is perfumey, a bit of koji, alcohol and strong fruity esters that remind me of Golden Glow (the only apple cider so nasty I wont allow it on the site).  A bit thicker than most sakes, not surprisingly.  Fairly strong alcohol dominates, heating the throat on the way down.  Fair bit of ricey/starchy/koji (whatever you wish to call it) and very light peachy-type esters as well.  Background nuttiness?

It poured a milky off-white - reminded me of soymilk.  Aroma is sweet, fruity, coconut - basically a tropical sake.  Taste was nice - fruit sweets, hint of lemon, coconut, the very mellow alcohol presence towards the end gives it a warm feeling.  The only negative thing about this is that its a little bit silty or grainy - Ill have to take note on other Nigoris to see if thats common with this style.  Very good.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"

I dont know what looks less appealing, this or the normal crystal clear sake.  mmm..sweet to start with lots of citrusy and nutty flavors coming through.

1585,"2004-10-08",3.0,"UPDATED: JUL 16, 2007 2004 bottle.  Served chilled but I let it warm as I tried it too.  I was shocked, it poured a pearl-cream colored tapioca consistency white.  Pearl seems to be a fitting name for this.  Aroma is hardly reminiscent of other sakes Ive tried, but thats ok, this one was much fuller and more varied.  Not just sharp rice alcohol.  Its got pineapple, coconut milk, mangoes, rich, vanilla, tapioca and a hint of alcohol.  Flavor is much like coconut, light cedar and rice pudding.  Very sweet, as has been said, but for some reason, that didnt seem to bother me.  It wasnt syrupy and with this much alcohol, I had to drink it slowly, so it didnt get cloying.

The mouthfeel, being an unfiltered sake, was delightful.  Smooth, creamy and lightly chewy/grainy.  Finishes on a rice note, with some alcohol perceivable.  I absolutely LOVE highly Unfiltered beers, and this is no exception, being a sake.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1585,"2004-03-16",1.9,"UPDATED: DEC 23, 2005 The appearance may be offputting to some, but the Nigori style is as old as the hills and is revered by many.  The fact that this is also a Genshu (undiluted) is a negative to me, but Ill try to stay objective.  The Pearl is a very sweet, creamy beige nigori with little grittiness.  Aromas of coconut and coladas waft from the glass, making for tantalizing sniffing.  Sadly, you ultimately have to taste the stuff, and thats where some of the fun ends (thought not all).  Momokawa seems to cater to a different palate than the Japanese brewers, since Momokawa is US based, and as such seems to have created a sweeter, milder Nigori that is honeyish (like the rest of the Momokawa line) and uncomplicated.  I think many Americans will like this sweet nigori with some apple undertones and an extremely creamy mouthfeel.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"

Sweet alcohol and sugar aroma, soft initial mouthfeel with a slight stinging in the finish.  Quite subtle indeed... first sake for me, so I would say it's a soft and grainy, sweet milk and rice flavor mixture.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1585,"2004-02-16",3.7,"Milky cream (tofu water) color. Aroma of wax and pungent fermented rice. Flavors of ripened apple and lots of rice after an intial sunburst of lemon. Extremely smooth. Lingering sweet palate. I don't have any other sake ratings or any definite way to rate one, but I will say that this is the best sake I've ever had (have had 2-3 others).","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
1585,"2004-02-15",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 13, 2004 Served cold: Swirly, creamy pear with nice cling. Gorgeous wax, white grape, and paper aroma. Sharp, yet remarkably concealed alochol to go along with the light tannins. Creamy, grainy mouthfeel. Very fruity initial with a firm vinous sensation and a hint of pear. Finishes with sweet and creamy rice notes, wax, and and very little trace of the hefty 18% alcohol. Overall it's remarkably smooth and fruity, which completely diffuses the 18% down to what seemed to be 8%. This was aboslutely splendid with pepper steak and spicy tuna rolls.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1585,"2004-02-13",2.9,"Milky white, a little viscous.  A little gritty.  Sweet.  Sweet aroma also.  The 18% abv is very well masked.","Denver, Colorado, USA","AustinMilbarge"
1585,"2004-01-14",3.4,"Opaque off-white color...very semen-like. The aroma is dominated by the alcohol, but some nice fruity tones come through late in the whiff. The flavor is also dominated by the alcohol...extremely sweet, coconut (reminded me of a pina colada), and sweet fruits. Slipper, silky feel...slightly thin...very wet finish.","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"
1585,"2004-01-14",3.2,"My first sake rating! I may need to adjust this when I get a better idea of what sake is like. Very cloudy, opaque white color. The aroma was mostly alcohol and faint floral perfume. Flavor was perfume, alcohol, and coconut with a tapioca aftertaste. Somewhat chalky thin palate.","Fresno, California, USA","flutetokill"
1585,"2003-12-10",1.7,"750 mL bottle, snifter, 60 degrees F.  Milky, murky, white body leaves rings of sediment in the glass.  It would be futile to argue that there's not a strong resembalence to...uh...nevermind.  Coconut, alcohol, chalk, sweet wine aromas.  Soooo...all I'm tasting is sweet rice-flavored wine.  Texture is soft and oily.  The bottom line is: the appearance put me off, I'll try to go back a little later (freakin' 750) and see if my opinion changes.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"
