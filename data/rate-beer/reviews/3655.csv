3655,"2017-05-18",4.1,"750ml bottle. Pours an opaque mahogany with a thin, creamy, short lived, fully dissipating, brown head.

Sweet flavour of roasted malt, figs, prunes, raisins, licorice, molasses, tobacco, caramel, chocolate, vanilla and oak with a warming whisky finish. Full body with a creamy, smooth, rich, oily texture and soft carbonation. Excellent complexity. Almost sinful. A world class old ale.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","cmacklin"

3655,"2017-04-01",3.3,"750ml bottle. The aroma is pleasant with chocolate, smoke & whsiky. The taste promises much but fails to deliver with a chocolatey sweetness then a vinious astringency in the middle. Full flavoured but not near as good as I expected.

3655,"2017-03-23",3.0,"Hmm... like a few below have mentioned, I think my bottle must have been from a bad batch... Im getting very little of the flavours people are mentioning in other reviews, its all overpowered by a dry, vinous tartness. Bit weird... going to have to seek it out again and re-review if it is indeed a bad batch, as it stands I didnt enjoy this very much at all.","Stockport, Cheshire, ENGLAND","likeatrainwreck"
3655,"2017-03-07",3.0,"UPDATED: MAR 14, 2017 330ml bottle, House of Bruar. Aroma is quite inviting, vanilla, roast. First taste is burnt dry roast, smokey peat but followed by a strong sherry-like sourness. Slightly thin for the style. I couldnt tell if the sourness was intentional or mistaken. Very unusual, but off putting. I didnt enjoy this beer and at £10 a bottle I expected alot more. From reading other good reviews I wonder if this is a bad batch as the tanginess was very pronounced as if it contained Lactobacillus","Blackpool, Lancashire, ENGLAND","Antzrhere"
3655,"2017-02-13",2.9,"Appearance: near opaque black with a short, short-lived beige head, no lacing. (3/5) Aroma: burnt sugar, black strap molasses, dark chocolate, wood, dried fruit, cardboard.

Looks kind of like a stout, but tastes like a cross between a Barley Wine and an Old Ale. Quite a bit thinner than Idve expected based on its appearance. Seems a bit oxidised, so I guess it was a mistake to cellar a flip-top for more than three years. A bit meh, especially for the price. (12/20)","CANADA","UXO"

3655,"2017-01-29",2.9,"Bottle, 2014 vintage. Pours deep clear ruby black, minimal head, wisp of a ring of tan foam and not much lacing. Aroma is pretty much sherry, port, some oaky vinous notes. Flavor is medium sweet, light plus bitter. Medium body, low carbonation. Better after it warms, but this one apparently does not age well, cause it is high on oxidation and pretty rough around the edges. Kind of hot as well.

3655,"2016-06-03",3.5,"From a 330ml bottle on 3/6/2016 (bottled 27/3/2015, Gyle no. 954). Pours the darkest brown with pretty much no head. The aroma features some light whisky notes, dark and dried fruit, and is quite vinous in character. Taste wise, its quite sharp and sweet, with cherries, prunes, chocolate and soy. Theres a good dash of whisky, and a light acidic bitterness. The texture is slightly syrupy and the carbonation soft. Desmond has proclaimed this his fave beer of all time, but its not really my cup of tea.

Pretty much black with a small tan head that lasts well and never quite disappears. Smells surprisingly like normal Dark Island with hazelnuts, chocolate, pears, earth. Theres a breath of whisky too and heavily oaked red wine. Silky, low carbonation. Rather more of a whisky influence now, but still surprising how much the base beer comes through. Dried fruit, chocolate, mild roast, vanilla, meadowy herbal and spice notes. Lots of almost delicate things going on. Cant quite tell how much is bitterness and how much is alcohol at the end.

The nose is a lovely rich roasted malty affair with woody overtones and whiskey esters. Taste wise it follows the same lines, rich maltiness with wood and whiskey notes: add some dark fruitiness and a block of Bournville chocolate into the mix and you just about have the flavours nailed down. Half way down the beer I had some French soft cheese from the Vosges area and they complimented each other beautifully along with some Tuc biscuits. What a lovely, lovely beer this is.

3655,"2014-08-10",4.7,"I will first state that this high a rating is partly--and only partly--perhaps--and only perhaps--due to sentiment, and that part is further due roughly 23/40ths to the circumstances surrounding the drinking and roughly 17/40ths to the beer being something fun and different.

This excellent, unique beer has a wonderful mouthfeel--a cup of silk, with cream: a certain water-gossamer lightness (or gossamer water-lightness)--like biting into a lush, soft, icing-based pastry (I cannot remember the name of the particular pastry of which I am thinking). It has the aftertaste of splendid churchwine. The taste is hard to pin down, like most good beers, but there are hints of sweet, faint cherry. I would sum up the main taste as ""coffee & port with holy water."" There is a soft, soft burn to it; one would probably not (accurately) guess straightaway its alcohol content. Overall, the beer is best enjoyed with key members of your closest family and a viewing of The Grand Budapest Hotel or To Catch a Thief. To do so while sitting on a magic carpet is preferable. The color is somehow both pure red and pure black. A very classy, delicate, and delicious beer. Hard to find, and even harder to capture. Its like chasing a deer in a forest in a poem. The only true negative about this beer is regret that it is but all too fleeting, combined with its being a limited edition (which I hope is one promise upon which Orkney will renege). A great experience. I pity those who have not tried it and envy those with more than one bottle.","","Murano"

3655,"2012-12-31",5.0,"My highest rating to date.  A glorious beer.  This was bottled 13 months ago and is even better than it was a year ago.  It pours sluggish its so full bodied.  Jet black, brown on the pour and has a tan coloured head.  Still well carbonated.  The aroma of Christmas cake hit me as the swing top hissed.  Sniffing the beer, its chocolatey, rich and telling me to drink it.  

The first taste is viscous, warm, rich and fruity and full of complexity.  The whisky notes on this beer are as good if not better than ive tasted on any other.  So definite but so discrete and balanced.  There is a nice bitterness.  This is Christmas pud in a glass, and full of cherry, dark chocolate and caramel.  The flavour left in the mouth is rich, warm and lasting.

An excellent beer and one Orkney should be proud of.  This beer may seem pricey at circa £15 for 750ml (which is expensive) but when you consider £7 for 330ml it is good value compared to average beers ive had from other brewers, Anarchist/alchemist being most notable.  This is a yearly treat and one i hope continues.  Glorious!","West Midlands, ENGLAND","Alecwallace"

3655,"2012-12-24",3.9,"Bottle from 2007, purchased early 2010. Pours deep brown to black with no head at all, no sign of carbonation. The aroma shows clear signs of aging, both in a good and bad way. Strong oxidation making way for huge plum, oak and tawny aromas. Nose is very similar to port wine. Additional notes of chocolate and soft whisky. The oxidation is strong and sinister at first, but as you get into it, it actually compliments the beer itself very well. Taste is influenced by the oxidation in a similar but far less delightful way. It is almost as if the oxidation thins out the body and makes the tastes appear in a shallow manner. Tastes similar to port wine, lots of prunes, caramel, muddled oak, a bit of whisky notes, and a hint of raw cocoa beans. A beer to get used to, but as soon as you look oast thestrong oxidation, it has some very nice and subtle qualities. I especially like dark malt profile combined with the fruity whisky notes.

Already a fan of the normal Dark Island. This is a totally different animal. Would recommend trying it along with some strong cheese such as a mature cheddar or a stilton. The sweetness of the beer contrasts well. A huge beer which you really need to drink more like a fine wine or even a whisky instead of just chucking it back.

Light slick tan head which is easy at first but quickly dies a death.Beautiful beautiful nose. Deep damp thick Christmas cake nose which morphs into black forest gateaux before settling on rich chocolate truffle.
Medium smooth body. Smooth and silky on the palate with a rich cakey and almost  cherry quality. Complexity leads to a dry light earthy bitterness at the end before the creamy chocolaty aftertaste kicks in.

3655,"2012-04-06",4.0,"750mL bottle, bottled in 2006.  Poured very deep brown with a rich, dark brown head.. looked great in the glass!  The aroma picked up sour oak and smoky notes over toasty chocolates, dark fruit, and vinous notes.. nice balance to it, but just slightly skewed toward the barrel.  The flavor opened with tangy vinous notes, oak, and whiskey, with dry-roasted chocolates, molasses, and a little fruit beneath.. tart whiskey and a little cognac on the edges.. dry-roasted black malts plus plenty more whiskey and smoke on the warm, tasty finish.  Heavier-bodied with low carbonation on the palate.. a tad too much barrel tanginess.. good flow, but not great.  Overall this was very complex and tasty, and not far from being spectacular.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
3655,"2012-04-06",4.1,"Pours very dark with a very quick split second head that quickly fades to nothing. The nose is strong vanilla, raisins, oak and booze. Flavor is sweet up front and then catches some bitter toward the end. Nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Starts a bit dull but crisps up in the middle for a nice lively and long finish.

A - Dark black with a deep brown hue on the edge. Smaller than average foamy and fairly creamy, dark tan head. Disappears pretty fast leaving behind a thin patchy lace.

S - Oaky, whisky aroma with a good amount of vanilla as well with a spicy, peaty aroma. Some chocolate fudge-like aroma with a bit of roasted malt and dark fruit, especially black currant. Interesting and enjoyable aroma.

T - Similar to the nose with dark chocolate and roasted malt starting out. Strong whisky flavors come out and remain with peat/oaky flavors along with a pretty strong amount of vanilla. Dark fruit and anise come out a bit stronger mid to end sip. Fairly sweet, but the whisky peat and spiciness cuts that a bit. A rich, chewy malty beer overall with an enjoyable mix of chocolaty malt and whisky.

M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Rich and slightly slick feeling.

D - Pretty drinkable. Alcohol is present but it isnt overly strong, and it works fine with the whisky presence. A little on the sweet side, but the whisky cuts that nice. Definitely a sipper, but one I kept wanting to sip.

Notes: Overall I really liked the mix of whisky and rich chocolaty malt along with a good showing of dark fruit. I liked the mixture of sweet and whisky, neither are too powerful and work well together.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

So I pull out a nice big wine glass for this brew and serve it straight from the cellar on a cold, damp Autumn evening. Looks an absolute treat; opaque black body holds a tight brown head, painting the glass with mocha legs.

Nose explodes with potent aromatics; espresso, dark chocolate, vanilla bean, peated malt, toasted oak, dates and dried figs, mollasses - to cut a long story short; it smells delicious, like some sort of intoxicatingly rich dessert.

The body is probably a bit leaner than I was expecting, ie something I could chew on, but still very thick by most standards. Syrupy texture with tremendous length and subdued carbonation; its clings to the palate for an eternity.

Where to start with that flavour!? So complex, enough to make me somewhat poetic; caramelised figs drizzled with thick dark chocolate sauce chased with a shot of fresh vanilla-infused espresso, served in a Scottish distillery. Ok, maybe not, but its very tasty and theres ALOT going on!
Finishes a bit drying, moderately bitter with a lingering mocha oak note.

I was expecting alot from this beer (certainly paid alot!), luckily it delivered. Deeply complex, to the point where I started rambling like a high school girl. Tremendously well-rounded on top of the complexity, which is the proverbing icing on the cake.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

Nose contains plenty of dark chocolate and coffee as well as concentrated yeast, malt, raisins, honey and, like it says on the label, figs and dates. The whisky is present both on the nose and in the mouth, and is integrated quite well. The flavour combines most of the elements from the aroma as well as hints of dark berries, vanilla, port and a little saltiness (from the whisky barrels perhaps?).

3655,"2009-08-06",4.4,"When I die, I want to be buried in an old, well-used oak barrel, bourbon or single-malt preferably. I wouldnt recommend digging me up after a few decades, rot and all, but at least then my body can properly mature in the same vein as some of the most supple, heavenly inspired spirituous drinks in the world; especially beer and whisky. Mm pardon me while I wipe the drool from my mouth.


Deep clear orange with amber highlights streaking across her depths, a simple head fades nonchalantly into oblivion, leaving nary a bubble or trail of lace to call her own. Thats ok, because they would just get in the way of her voluminous nose. Sun-soaked white raisins dripping rum juice, plump, moist, and ripe for the taking are met with maple drizzles and cinnamon sticks. Lightly toasted brown sugars crunch atop rich, sticky dark fruits. All of this leads to a smooth finish of butterscotch, sweet whisky notes, and vanilla tinged oak tannins. Pinch me, I must be dreaming. As we meet in a lusty frenzy, I am surprised by how lean and clean-cut her body and mouthfeel is. Fresh oak sits comfortably next to brushed leather while moist pitted dark fruits loom closer on the horizon. Her sweet side is all caramel and maple syrup of the finest quality; no adjuncts or additives here. Nutmeg and cinnamon whisper atop my tongue and mingle in my lingering breath. Each sup and breath is clean, warm, and tinged with butterscotch and whisky. Usually ales aged in whisky barrels are heavy, rich, and more of a sipping brew then a quaffing brew. The Orkney Dark Island Reserve Orcadian Ale Aged in Whisky Casks is clean, balanced, and very sessionable in spite of, or maybe because of her wondrously whisky influenced palate.


Well played. If you happen to come across a bottle, make sure to bring one home. Usually I would say to age it, but I think she is best enjoyed fresher than older. Of course, you could always find out for yourself, but I thought she was spot-on just the way she was.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

In long: The keyword here is burnt.  Burnt black cake, burnt brown sugar and burnt wood.  Way too much residual sugar.  Desperately needs hops to dry it out.

This serious creature of a Barley Wine stuns the tastebuds with its oaken alcohol, fruity chocolate, vanilla-like sweet spiciness, and peaty earthiness for a classy but stern moment of sipping.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A thin ring of foam decorates the reddish blackness.
-The alcohol is strong throughout, almost burning in the finish. This is obviously meant for slow sipping.
-The body is quite healthy and never falls into syrupy textures.
-The fruitiness is also redolent of black grapes and cherries.

Thin, light brown head on top of a ruby-black body. Peaty aroma containing oak, dark coffee malt and a underlying note of liquorice. The flavour character appears as reminiscent of a dry, semi-sweet port wine. The vanilla oak works quite well together with figs and raisin. The concluding bitterness has got a smoky touch to it. Maybe rather too wine-like. I must admit that I had expected a little more, but, nonetheless, it is a fine drink for having a good time on late evenings (shared at Finns, Tromsø 18.02.2009).","Tromsø, NORWAY","Rune"

A very nice aroma; sweet roasted malts and rich fruits, nothing like a BW. Later as it warmed it became sweeter and more sugary, lots of barrel goodness. The flavor is excellent; sweet woody and whiskey flavors, some dark fruits, figs and tobacco, roasted and smoky peat flavors, some light vanilla. A lively and full palate. Excellent.

Once again an amazing brew was cracked open.  I am going to have to start doing some serious trading to have something worthwhile to contribute to these tastings as I dont know how people find these rarities.  Actually in this case I do as it just hit Ohio according to someone.  If you run across this in the store dont hesitate to put it in your cart.
Aroma / Appearance - The fluid black body was darker than I expected a barley wine to be.  Whiskey, malt and oily scents stand out though there is also resiny burnt pine providing a solid foundation.
Flavor / Palate - Blue raspberries blended into iced coffee form a very strange partnership.  Oily and slightly stale hops unfold before the vinuous warm finish.  The alcohol is evident but does not ruin the experience.  Overall this is a very solid release.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3655,"2008-03-16",4.1,"Rating #1300Huge thanks to Degarth for opening this much anticipated brew. Pours deep dark brown with dark tan head. The aroma is simply huge and inviting. I get sweet rich Concord grapes in high volume along with earthiness, faint peat, dark roasted malts, faint dark chocolate and a mild, yet building, sense of alcohol. The taste is very similar to the nose with caramel candy, earthiness, mild peat that slowly turns into sweet rich ripe dark fruitiness of dark grapes, prunes and sweet plums. I also get notes of fudge brownies, moderate booze sensation and wood. Some mild acidity lingers into the after taste along with layers of roasty  earthy  dark fruity notes.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

3655,"2008-02-28",3.9,"Pours with nearly no head atop a brown body with red light at the edge of the liquid.  Super, super sweet maple and whisky nose, I guess it’s a little cold at first, because the aroma develops significantly over time, eventually turning less sweet and more approachable – amaretto and almonds mixed with burnt, nutty maple, mixed with some chewy caramel malt base to the barley wine/strong ale that’s beneath this massive infusion of sweet whisky.  But, for all the faults I could find in the smell, none of them mattered much because of the just absolutely amazing flavor that develops in the finish… up front it’s on the sweet side, and then over the middle a little more of the true whisky and wood flavors are first noticed, right before an amazingly rich and decadent bitter cocoa and chocolate flavor coast the tongue, along with a soothing flavor of dried prunes, raisins, some nuts, and some coffee.  Really, exceptionally complex in the finish, and I really with the aroma and initial flavor were as stellar.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Without a lamp I would definately call it pitch black. Putting my nose close to this fuidum makes me in doubt about what is actually in the glass as it is very vineous, coffee, cocoa, prunes and plums and a good deal of alcohol. Flavor though is beer not wine, thank God. Still coffee, cocoa prunes, plums and maybe even raisins. Low carbonation, long aftertaste.  If it is the long storage in oak barrels I do not know but the high alcohol contents is very well hidden and the beer appears smooth, round, pleasant and what else I can use of positive words.

3655,"2007-10-18",2.7,"Mostly lasting light tan head covers the deep Bordeaux-brown shade. The scotch certainly comes up in here. Alcohol remains well contained in the nose though. Tar, oil, peat and generally fat malts make up for the aroma profile. Its body is thick and punctuated solely by very soft carbonation. Rather disturbing mouth experience though, it displays the 4 basic flavours in spades and surprisingly, the unusual sourness and saltiness might be the dominating ones. Other beers like Orval can reach the 4 basic flavours as well, but not by focusing on sour and salt, its tremendous dryness saves Orval and throws it in mythic territory. Here, the beer feels more mineral than hoppy. I dont deny its grand complexity, but I find it chaotic and the sour/salty combo is honestly out of place in this peaty, molasses oriented rich ale that does not deserve to be so easily linked to soy sauce.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Molasses notes and some alcohol too. The flavor follows the same path, with a good warmth to support the dark, roasted flavors. Full-bodied. Oxidation and roasted malts in the finish. A lovely one, but not as lovely as I remembered it. Hope to visit another bottle in the future. 090728","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

3655,"2006-11-04",4.1,"Bottle. Dark brown / black color with virtually none head. Nice nose, clear more warmer and mature then the regular Dark Island, the whisky shows very soft and mixes perfectly with the malty aromas. Long warm finish with lots of power, fruity pleasant aromas of berries, dried figs and prunes. Little carbonation, slightly bitter and a bit thin in texture. I must say as ""henrikb"" it is a  very good idea to age the Dark Island in Whisky barrels, the beer has really gained from it.","VestJylland, DENMARK","fonefan"

3655,"2006-10-30",3.8,"Bottled. Dark brown coloured. Quite unclear. Light brown head. Sweet and ripe fruity aroma with light roasted and cocoanotes. Has definate similarity to portwine and the whiskey can be sensed. Flavour is quite alcoholdense. Prunes and light roast detectable together with a light touch of spice. Medium bodied. Quite dry. Has a fruity alcholdense end. Interesting barralaged.","Søborg, DENMARK","madsberg"
