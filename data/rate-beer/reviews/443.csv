443,"2014-08-16",3.5,"300 ml bottle bought at Wellcome Superstore in Sheung Shui.
Clear and colourless; Fragrant aroma of rice wine, with fresh pears, peaches, ume (Japanese apricot), alcohol, sugar and light boiled glutinous rice; Medium sweet taste of rice spirit, with mashed pear flesh, light floral, strong warming alcohol and moderate tartness; Light body, dry and watery palate; Mouth feel is fairly dry - sake style - in a very watery body. Fairly strong rice tartness background, with nice light pureed pear closely followed by strong, smart, slightly warming 15% booze, which is light, sharp but never harsh. Very likeable and dangerous Fairly dry after taste; Light and fruity to mouth.

Comments: This one is a crowd pleaser because its so easy to mouth with nice peary esters and seemingly timid alcohol. Dont be fooled: this is a nice sipper from the get-go. Just respect it and youll be rewarded with a relaxing session. A nice and easy one!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

443,"2004-08-08",3.2,"Clear with very little legs. Aroma is toasty & fruity with melon & anise; VERY buttery. Flavor is thick & rich with some alcohol notes. Impact is fruity & long. Decent Junmai but lacks any complexity & subtlety.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
443,"2004-05-31",2.9,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2004 This is my first rating of sake. Pours, well clear, im guessing this is how its supposed to look, so a big 5! Aroma had a almost pear like smell, very sweet. Taste was slightly sweet at first, with a pear taste, then faded to an slightly salty, slightly sour, almost like a green apple. Very smooth going down, very impressive, with 16% going down this smoothly I think ill try some more sake soon.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
443,"2003-12-22",4.7,"like smelling a small orchid - with hints of aroma of delicate rice, rather sweet - with an oily palate to it that was caressed with a tiny ease of alcohol, was almost too easy to drink, reminded me almost of sugar water but with just a hit of sugar and no sour aspects","Torrance, California, USA","lunaticharness"
