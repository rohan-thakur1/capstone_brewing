2142,"2016-12-29",3.7,"2010 Bottle @ smöf. Pours a dark amber, brownish body with a small tan head. Port, toffee and malts are the dominant aromas. Also notes of liquorice and leather.

Deep ruby, small beige head. Smokey, toasted, junipery aroma. Full-bodied. Honey sweetness, smoke, some juniper - gin like alcoholic burn, caramel malts. Interesting - not much like a sahti (Gotlandsdricke), but has quite traditional feeling.","Pori, FINLAND","TBone"
2142,"2011-03-22",3.9,"Draught at Akkurat, Stockholm.  Lightly hazy brownish amber. Fruity smokey juniper aroma. Sweet and full bodied. Fruity, estery and junipery Gotlandsdricke-like flavour. Salty and sugary, potent and imposing, where honey and juniper smoke comes to dominate the finish.
Similar to Vivungs Dragöl, the stronger version of the only commercially produced Gotlandsdricke in modern times.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
