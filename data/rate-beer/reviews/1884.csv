1884,"2011-06-07",3.7,"Appearance: Clear, middling amber-hued body with a modestly-sized, white head.

Smell: Sweetish and bready on the nose, with a faint background note of finely-ground spice. Some orchard fruit lovingly rinsed in quality alcohol.

Taste: Bready malts, tastes of crumpled sugar cookies, and a sweetish akin to golden syrup with a faint backing of light-colored caramel. Earthy spiciness, then a sliver of lemon peel, then a bite of apple and apricot. Ample bitterness. Sweetish and lightly spicy on the warming finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-plus carbonation. The slight boost in carbonation works to cut through the slight stickiness of the mouthfeel.

Overall: A bit up there, boozewise, but not bad overall, and a nice brew to start up and close out the annual Sausage Fest at 5 Seasons.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
1884,"2010-06-24",3.2,"Clear reddish orange with a fizzy white head. Faint malty aroma and a slightly tangy nutty flavor.","Berkeley, California, USA","badlizard"
1884,"2010-05-19",3.4,"This poured an amber color with a caramel and toffee aroma. Some sugar and caramel in the flavor. The aftertaste is bitter and sweet. Overall a nice beer","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
1884,"2009-06-14",3.6,"On tap at the brewpub on 6/3/08: Pours a transparent copper bronze with a frothy clingy-lacing off-white head.  Aroma of sweet caramely and grainy German malt with some slightly bready notes and light fruity esters.  Body starts fairly full and light caramely and Munich malty sweet with a slightly earthy noble hop balance and a semi-sweet authentic finish.  An enjoyable Maibock.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1884,"2009-05-24",4.3,"Pours a dark, clear coppery color with a decent fine-bubbled copper-cream head. Rich aroma is spicy - cloves and cinnamon - and malty. Mouth-filling malty flavor has an undertone of cinnamon and cloves, as well as hints of caramel and banana. Texture is pleasingly smooth and tingly, and it leaves a nice spicy aftertaste.Earlier Rating: 5/28/2007 Total Score: 4.5Color is a beautiful clear reddish-brown with a thick head. Aroma is hoppy and has a toffee hint. Flavor has noticeable hoppy and malty components, with nutty undertones and a whisper of toffee or caramel. Sweet and bitter tastes balance very nicely and complement each other.

Heartily recommended!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
1884,"2008-06-04",3.2,"Very malty aroma, that screams bubblegum, and sweet maltiness that follows through into the flavor, rich caramel sweetness, that rides a wave of honey and citrus bitterness in the finish, but does not carry on from there, the finish just drops right off leaving no lingering flavors on the palate.  Overall not bad, but not worth writing home about.","Gulf Shores, Alabama, USA","BlackDonald"
1884,"2008-05-13",3.8,"Draught @ brewery
Very nice malty lager. color is spot on for Einbecker Maibock. Copper not gold like other maibocks. I donÂ’t get the huge malt aroma or flavor of a bock, nor the slight fusel alcohol taste that should be there.","Mentor, Ohio, USA","alebrewer"
1884,"2007-10-09",3.4,"On top at the restaurant.  Clear as all hell (very impressive), with a thin head of micro bubbles.  Smells of corn, molasses, and cherry bubblegum.  Upon the first sip, I remark to myself that maibocks are usually thicker than this in my experience; lots of unfermented sugars it seems just floating around; smooth; dark grains dominate the middle; subdued citrus fruit throughout, like oranges or kiwi; no lacing, and not much carbonation at all.  Warming.  You get a bit of hops at the end, but nothing to write about.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

1884,"2005-05-12",3.6,"Pours golden amber with good white head.  Malty and fruity in the aroma.  Lots of body.  Flavor is malty as a bock should be, but balances more to the hops.  I think this one is better than last years version and better than some of the others from this brewer recently.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","RateandPillage"
1884,"2005-05-03",3.4,"Draft at the brewery: Pours copper with a thick white head. Mild fruit aroma. Slightly sweet flavor with a moderate alcohol taste. Sweet and mildly bitter finish. A nice beer.","Nolanville, USA","MrRomero"
1884,"2004-05-29",3.4,"Has a light copper appearance with a decent, but quickly fading aroma. Sweet, malty aroma. Clean, smooth mouthfeel. Very well balanced. Flavor has elements of bubble gum and some caramel too. Very hoppy for a bock - but very nice.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
1884,"2004-05-28",3.6,"This critter does waver into IPA territory, so it loses a little on faithfulness to style.  The aroma is floral and sweet - freshness abounds.  The malt appears in the flavor, and rides and even balance right through the end with the cascade of west coast hops.  Better than average, but not as big as the higher ABV version could be.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","skaughty"
1884,"2004-05-07",3.3,"Strange sort of grapefruit aroma.  Very malty with a grain alcohol type presence.  Very sweet flavor becomes a moderately sweet, lightly astringent finish.  Medium heavy body, oily texture, lively carbonation.  The bottom line is: the beer that started me on this path to distruction is not quite as good as I remember...","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"
1884,"2002-12-16",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 20, 2003 ReRate: A year later. I noticed more hops this year, not quite as malty. Deep amber color with nie head. Some hints of spice in the middle. Definate hops finish","Manchester, Missouri, USA","kwoeltje"
1884,"2002-05-30",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 5, 2004 A very spicy nose. I'd almost say black pepper for the aroma, but not quite. Pepper is present in the flavor however and fits in very nicely with the light malt. One of the breweries better offerings, although still suffering from that watery nature.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
