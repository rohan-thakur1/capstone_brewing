1466,"2016-10-15",4.2,"On tap during the brewerys third anniversary. The aroma wins with a distinct bourbon character of leather, caramel, chocolate, and a hint of dark cherry. 
No foam on the black 7oz pour. There was little lacing after sipping. A bit thin on the mouthfeel compared to others in the field. The alcohol is well blended with some heat on the back end, though I could not discern any coffee notes neither in the aroma nor in the taste,      which I find strange because the base beer is after all, Coffee and Cigarettes. The beer may have been taken over by the bourbon?","California, USA","popway"
1466,"2016-02-15",4.6,"Draft at the brewery. Pours an opaque brown with a small dark tan that settles into just a bubbly ring eventually. Good gravy, this aroma is absolutely flawless- smooth, warming bourbon throughout, lightly charred oak, fresh roast coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, marshmallow, molasses, and very faint smoke. Medium-bodied, with low to moderate carbonation and a sweet, smoky, roasty, smooth, and subtly warming mouthfeel. This is stunning. Gorgeous in every sense. This was the first Cellarmaker beer I had out of the nights lineup and its safe to say Im fully on board with what theyre doing.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

Nice bourbon character, but its well integrated and not overpowering. Lots of graham cracker, vanilla, and dark chocolate. Really nicely done.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

1466,"2016-02-05",5.0,"""Cellarmaker"" is a misnomer for a small-batch brewery that specializes in ultra-fresh hoppy beers, right? Nope. These guys do bourbon-barrel-aged better than most, if not all, of their competitors, including those distributed nationally. The next time youre drinking Founders KBS in the Bay Area, slap your forehead and exclaim: ""I could have had an Imperial Coffee and Cigarettes!""","Mountain View, California, USA","dpitinga"
1466,"2016-02-03",4.1,"On draft at Cellarmaker. Pours an opaque dull black with beige head that steadily dissipates into bubbly lacing. Smells of chocolate, vanilla, ank oak up front with some coffee in the background. Tastes like it smells, but more coffee-forward, with some roast as well.

1466,"2016-01-26",4.6,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2016 Yeah...
Dont even know where to start with this. Still somehow maintains that awesome coffee/smoke/smoothness/balance that both the base and base imperial versions have. Smooth as snot on a glass eye, and the bourbon is SO well integrated without overpowering or taking a back seat, adding vanilla, coconut and a hint of booze. Probably the best SF beer Ive ever had. 4.5+","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
