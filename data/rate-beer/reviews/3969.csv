3969,"2015-12-07",4.6,"Pitch black and completely opaque without even the slightest trace of lighter color. Two finger frothy beige head that slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Excellent retention, taking a while to settle and completely coating the glass with sheets of soapy lacing. Looks incredible!

Very inviting aroma wih a complex hop profile thats nicely countered by a robust dark malt backbone. Dank, earthy resins, grassy pine needle, spruce tip and floral kind buds along with subtle citrus/tropical fruit sweetness. This is somewhat overpowered by the resins and malt but theres hints of grapefruit, pineapple and orange peel. Deeply roasted dark malt backbone but not harsh, overly dry or acrid. Gourmet coffee bean, oatmeal, dark chocolate, charred toast along with subtle lighter malt sweetness. Lighter chocolate and caramel sweetness. Smells great!

Chewy viscous body with a blast of dank, earthy hop bitterness that lingers over the sweeter notes and robust malt backbone into a bone dry finish. Dry bitterness with dank juicy buds, grass, pine sap, spruce tip and resinous oils. This is countered by subtle citrus/tropical fruit sweetness. Strong tart grapefruit presence along with some pineapple and citrus pith. Deeply roasted malt backbone but again not harsh or ovely dry/acrid. Gourmet coffee/espresso bean with oatmeal, burnt toast and bitter dark chocolate. Slightly smokey as well but this is cut by lighter malt sweetness with hints of fudge, bakers chocolate, caramel and toffee. Usually not a fan of the style but this is incredibly well balanced, complex and dangerously drinkable at 10%. The best example of the style that Ive had.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

3969,"2014-06-29",3.9,"Heres my review of 3Fs version.
This was poured into a chalice.
The appearance was a super nice looking one finger white to off white foamy head that dissipates into a fairly decent looking black to dark brown colored body.
The smell had a super nice bitter allocation of coffee to roasted malts, bitter and somewhat piney hops come in pretty powerful to invade my nose.
The taste was bitter and sweet at separate times, I do get some chocolate and I do get some roasted coffee-ness. The aftertaste is nice and smooth through a nice coffee/chocolate flavoring. The finish is fairly quick and dry. On the palate, it sits about a medium on the body with a carbonation that is pretty good for the style and for me, nothing overly done but nothing subpar either. Overall, I say this is a pretty good American Black Ale well worthy of having again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Poured to snifters showing a ruby highlighted, black/brown color, with brownish tan, frothy, fairly lasting head foam, and wavy cling to the lacing. The nose was malty, roasted, cocoa, with a little wood & char, but a couple of odd hints of vegetal/celery, and a scent that I can only describe as freezer burn. Medium to full bodied, with decent carbonation, a rich malt base, potent, earthy, and lingering hop bitterness, somewhat disguised alcohol, and a finish that included a bit of tartness to accompany the astringency. The flavor notes became noticeably more cohesive as it warmed. Taken back some by the aroma, but otherwise, fairly impressed.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

This was a special tap for a fundraiser and well worth the $25 donation to get in the door. A world class black IPA has aspects of Surly and Three Floyd without a doubt. I am not as big a fan of Real Ale but they too know their stuff.

Aroma / Appearance - An inky black base swirls around the glass with a murky attitude. Smoke, ash, and warm hops rise from the glass like dark chocolate covered cones. The tension between the roasted malts and hops adds a nice mystery.

Flavor / Palate - Coffee, dark chocolate, and earthy hops ground a beer that could have gone for intensity instead. While the bitterness is not exactly subtle it takes time to build to a crescendo. Dark roasted coffee lasts long after the final sip. A well balanced world class beer is worth seeking out as fresh as possible.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3969,"2014-03-22",4.0,"Draft at Romans. Pours a jet black color with a tan head and some lacing. Aroma is hoppy, pine, some citrus, grapefruit. Medium on the palate with average carbonation. Flavor is sweet, malty, roasty, some bitter hops, pine, with a sweet, pine finish. I think the Surly version has a thicker, creamier mouthfeel. Otherwise equal.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","sherm1016"
3969,"2014-03-22",4.4,"22 ounce bottle, bottled on date of 02/14/14. Served in a Great Lakes goblet, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch and a half tan head. The head stays around a long time, and theres also a lot of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like pine and citrusy hops, roasted malt, and some bittersweet chocolate. It tastes like pine and citrusy (grapefruit, mango, light tropical fruit) hops, roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, burnt/charred malt and some coffee. Great mix of hops and bitter roastiness! Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, its creamy and a bit coating with moderate carbonation. Id say this is one of the best Black Ales Ive had, Id like to buy another bottle or 2 of this. $11.99 a bomber.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
3969,"2014-03-21",4.9,"Poured from a bomber into a 3F pint glass almost black with a thick tan head.
Aroma is a sweet roasted hops. Is that a smoked cocoa I detect?
Flavor blows my mind. Words wont work here. Thick delicate smoke roast of sweetness & a phenom finish of hops. 
The balance is incredible & this brew certainly made my #1 Black IPA list & my top 10 fave brews EVER!!!!","Ohio, USA","fitwitchik"

3969,"2014-03-19",4.2,"22oz bottle, shared with local raters. Very dark brown color, near-black. Nice thin khaki head, leaves great thicker lace. Awesome pine, citrus, grapefruit aromas in the nose. Interesting, kind of spicy malt profile, maybe some rye in there. Good light dark chocolate, hints of coffee. Moderate to bigger bitter taste, lightly spicy. Hides 10% alcohol well. Light sweetness. Medium to bigger body, light chewiness. Good, smooth, lighter carbonation. Good long roasty earthy piney hoppy aftertaste. Light ash. Fantastic, assertive, flavorful imperial black IPA.

3969,"2014-03-16",3.9,"Tap pour at brewpub - pour is pretty much black with a thin deep brown head - maybe not as dark as some stouts Ive enjoyed, but probably the darkest IPA Ive ever seen. Aroma is intense and piney, some chocolatey malts cling for dear life to keep this balanced, and it does work. Flavor is very good - oodles of piney, resinous hops, some citrus notes, caramelized/chocolate malt notes, and some early sweetness turns a particularly prickly bitter at the finish. Palate is chewy and thick - ABV well hidden. Glad I decided to give this one a try - top notch!","Valparaiso, Indiana, USA","valpoaj"
3969,"2014-03-15",3.7,"Bottle; Pour is murky brown with a fine bubbled, two finger khaki head into this glass. It retains on the modest side, with some light lacing / spotting present. It reminds me of their other black ipa (I forget the name, whatever), though perhaps less striking initial. Roasty, Chocolate, tropicals on the nose . The flavor profile is more interesting here ; bittering hop notes mesh with a strong roasted element, but there is more charred and smokey notes present. It has a soft center, moving to more tropicals, pine, and cocoa near the end here. It was worth a shot once, at least","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

3969,"2014-03-08",3.8,"22oz bottle courtesy of the blaw... Pours a stouts deeper than cola hue with less intense edges and topped with a creamy light beige head... Aroma of marshmallow cocoa and full on green pine citrusy hops throughout where the lupulin takes priority. Just as I would expect and nice to say the least as far a black IPAs go ... Initiates on the sweeter side but quickly gives way to a rather harsh bitterness. Cocoa roasted piney citrus hop overload where the latter overcomes what the former began. Bitterness lingers on well through the finish. Smooth creamy mouthfeel a bit of earthy chalky tones to pair alongside the aforementioned. Bruiser of a brew but I think it works as whole. Im not a huge dark IPA fan but this one fits the bill nicely although some might not enjoy the abrasive bitterness that it offers.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

Nose straight off the bat has a signature 3Fs aroma (i.e. hop forward dankness) mingling with roast and malt -- I have a head cold, but Im still getting it. Mouth is big and creamy, lots of dark malts mingling with hoppy goodness, pine, citrus, bakers chocolate, coffee, pumpernickel toast, nice bitterness balanced by mild sweetness, spicy rye notes as well. Not sure if this is gonna mix well with the cold meds, but fuck it. Really nice black IPA.","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"
3969,"2014-03-02",3.9,"Draft on tap at the brewppub (Munster, IN). Finally for doown for this one. Pours a deep blackish brown chocolate chip hue, darker opaque body with just a touch of ruby glow on the edges and bottom. Frothy darker brown head atop stays as a sizable layer, good stick around and lacing. Aromas show big fruity hop presence, bubblegum, tropical fruit, mango and papaya are juicy and lush. Some citrusy grapefruit, florals, gentle pine and darker maltsm bready, biscuity, touch of pine. Potent fruity hop melange really pushes the agenda. Initial is lighter end of medium bodied, stark dry and bitter hops dominate. The rich fruity nose, tropical fruit, citric and pineapple elements is there, but a firm even strong dry floral and piney bitterness envelopes the palate. Middle shows a bit of cocoa and toastiness on the palate, some carmelization gentle pushes through the hop onslaught. Dry and bitter, some toasty and carmelized body still hangs on a bit. Soapy and piney hop bitterness and dryness into the backend. The fruit element dies out a bit more, light roasty feel and charcoal/coffee thing going on. Really evolved. While the nose delivers a rich and intoxicating fruity hop slant, the beer itselff delivers the goods with firm to strong stark bitterness, fruity flourishes, citrus, earth, and toasty/carmelized/gently roasty malt bill. Well done beer here for Black IPA fans. Dug this a lot. While the taste never really developed to the level on the nose, its start bitterness and flow between elements on the palate really worked well.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

3969,"2014-02-18",3.9,"22 oz. bomber from the brewpub. Pours a dark black, nearly opaque, with a thin mocha head. Just by looking at it, you would think stout. Its that dark. However, upon first smell, you get a different story! So juicy with hops abound! (Mosaic? Simcoe? Galaxy?). Very dank tropical fruit and pine. Wow. A slight amount of roasted malt creeps in, but the nose is all hops! Taste is very interesting. Unlike any other ""Black IPA"" I have had. Very hop forward. Aromatic tropical fruits, floral bouquets, resinous pine sap...then comes the malt bill. Just a unique balance to this. Some roasted nut, coffee and dry chocolate. Kind of confuses the palate after getting the hop-bomb. A conundrum. It took several drinks before it all became to ""make sense"". I ended up really enjoying this! The finish had some very nice bittering hops that gave the juicy front-side a nice crisp back-end. (Fuggles?). A lot going on here, but it all works out in the end. I will be going after a few more of these!","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"
