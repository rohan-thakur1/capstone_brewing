Explosive citrusy and stone fruit hops, with florals, pine, grass, and a pale malt backbone. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a bitter, fruity mouthfeel.

Lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, guava, mango, melon, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity/earthy hops and moderate pale malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and zero astringent hop flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, bready/grainy, and sticky/resinous balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol for 7%. Overall this is a world class IPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity/earthy hops and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink; with the balanced bitter/drying finish. Super vibrant, dank, and juicy on hops; with a nice malt backbone that is never sweet. An insanely amazing offering.

Taking a page from small batch producers like Cellarmaker, this beer is hazy in the extreme. The marcom for the beer indicates that the beer uses cryogenically-frozen unkilned hops. But the technical people there said they are doing something a little more complicated in a recent post on BeerAdvocate: ""Greetings from Lagunitas....the hops are not cryogenically frozen, its a bit more complicated than that...This is an experimental release at 6 months to validate our new process for keeping wet hops fresh. If we get it right well be able to have a year-round wet hop beer...I think its going to work. Weve been screwing around with it for almost three years now. I hope you like it.....cheers.

4044,"2016-06-15",3.3,"Rated on 6-11-2016 at The Berg Ale Haus, Huntington, IN. This draft beers appearance is a small head that is fully lasting, golden yellow transparent body, very little visible carbonation observed, and one ring of lacing. The aroma is very aromatic, herbal, grassy, citrus hops, grapefruit, earthy, and fruity. The flavor is moderately bitter, sweet, citrus shops, and fruity. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and this beer is light bodied. Overall, there is something about the taste of this beer that just did not set well with my sense of taste. All I can say is that it is very weird tasting for this beers style. Next!!","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"

4044,"2016-06-11",3.4,"This draft brew from a beer bar poured a head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a typically carbonated transparent orange colored body and a fair lacing. The weak aroma was hoppy and musty. The crisp mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a lingering hoppy aftertaste. The tangy flavor contained notes of mild citrus mild nut mild caramel crisp and hops. A decent one that I would consider drinking again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
