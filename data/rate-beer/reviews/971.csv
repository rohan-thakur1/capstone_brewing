Some tropical bubblegum, a touch of menthol. Doesnt come across as as bitter as XX and is confusingly both softer and more pungent.

Medium aroma of malts, caramel, Belgian yeast, fruit, grain, hops and citrus.

Appearance:

Turbid/opaque golden/amber beer with a slight/medium off-white head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts, caramel, Belgian yeast and fruit; ends slightly bitter and dry with grain, hops and citrus.

Overall:

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. Great standard Belgian Ale that could have something more. I am thinking of more fruity hops, some brettanomyces or spices. Great appearance and palate, but the aroma could have been stronger.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

FINALLY a reasonably fresh bottle of this, but of course I had to order it online from Belgium because American importers and distributors suck horribly at getting anything like this to retailers in less than a year anymore, especially Shelton Bros stuff. So yeah...this is obviously 4+ material, thats instantly obvious from the first sniff and sip. Hard to want much more out of an aroma...its bright and offers notes from every aspect of the brewing process...malt, hops, yeast, esters, phenols, and theyre all of the enticing sort. In the mouth its eye-openingly bitter (damned near too bitter), but theres plenty of residual sugar to keep it delicious. And its a very clean, low-acid, low-astringency type of dryness that is hard to complain about. It doesnt have the massive, rocky, meringue-like head or ultra-fluffy mouthfeel I expected but these are minor quibbles...this is world-class brewing beyond doubt.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

OCZY : piwo jest żółto-złote. Ma sporą piane o kolorze białym.

NOS : zapach piwa jest dosyć typowy dla belgijskiego ejla : świeży zapach twarogowy z nutami owoców takich jak morela, cytrusy i banan. Ale to wszystko w tyle bo na przodzie dominują mocne aromaty chmielowe takie jak skorki cytrusowe, pieprz, zioła. 

USTA : mocno gazowane piwo o średnim nasyceniu. Kremowe w ustach.
Szybko dominuje gorzki chmiel. Podstawa słodowa to nuty przypominające krakersy i czerstwy chleb. Można tez dodać delikatną kwaśność śmietany jak i zarazem jej oleistość. Pierwsze ""skrzypce"" gra chmielowa gorzkość. Ziołowa i cytrusowa. Trochę pomiędzy pestką od grejpfruta i jabłka. Gdzieś z tyłu można wyczuć coś jak pokrzywa. Posmak jest cierpki i gorzki i trochę parzy. 

ODCZUCIA : typowe piwo dla browaru De Ranke. Bezkompromisowa gorycz na świetnej podstawie. Nasycenie i nagazowanie jak zawsze perfekt. Piwo pije się łatwo i jest niesamowicie orzeźwiające. Proszę je nie mylić z saksońskim IPA bo to, że ma dużo chmielu i goryczy to nie wystarczy by je włożyć do tego samego koszyka.

971,"2014-02-05",3.8,"750 ml bottle from my Portland trip. 200th Belgian for me.

Given my fondness for De Ranke in general and for De Ranke in particular, I was intrigued when this came out but never thought Id get a chance to try it. Im very glad I did. Pours yellow with a fluffy white head into a Duvel tulip. Nose of dusty, peppery European hops -- Hallertau? -- seriously earthy, amply floral, a sour grassy aroma coming up behind, just a hint of Belgian yeast (it could use more of this character, I think) and the slightest note of alcohol. Flavor is a blast of grassy earthy hops, like a pilsner on roids (but much better than a US imperial pils!), flowery fields and a touch of soap. Bitter oils linger long on the tongue like grapefruit pith but not citric like the juice or peel. Mild malt sweetness of stone-ground wheat thins is there early in the long side of the finish. Early on this is easy enough to drink, though there is a just a bit of heat from the mere 6% abv. Halfway through the bottle palate fatigue sets in and Ive got to dock it a point from the overall for that. This one is close enough to the XX than I cant say much about the difference between them without trying them head-to-head. Im not sure this one would break into a regular rotation even if it was readily available, but its very enjoyable to try on a one-time basis.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Its dry and full bodied, with a quite high but pleasant level of carbonation. Perhaps a tad too bitter, but the pale malts deals nicely with it. Resins, some grass and a touch of pine cones. Theres a faint touch of white sugar here as well, but thats left in the remote background, just to remind us of its origin.

Definitely could not differentiate this from a fresh xx, but it smells every bit as good. Clean yeast provides only light background esters, mostly drowned out by the hops. Some dry biscuity malt undertones as well.The flavor departs a little more than the aroma, from the regular version. Right away I note more dryness and bitterness, though of course, its all relative to how fresh a bottle of XX youre comparing it to, not to mention this bottle is already 10 months old. Anyways, classy and elegant, with very little in the belgian character and closer to a delicious, hoppy, american golden ale. Boy is this stuff dry too. Perhaps, dare I say, too dry to balance the resinous hop assault?  Powerful stuff and perhaps a bit fatiguing by the end.  As much as I appreciate how clean the yeast profile is, the comparison to Taras Boulbas (which I feel sets the gold standard for these types of beers) leaves this one wanting a bit in the Belgian character. Of course, thats just personal preference and this is a terrific beer in its own right.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

971,"2013-12-26",4.8,"Brilliant golden. Billowy, tightly packed white head holds quite well. Remarkably bright and clean aromas of zippy phenols, sage, lilac, sherbet, potpourri, pastry cream, minerals, lemon zest, fennel seed, gum, pepper, dusty yeast. Highly perfumey, as well. Dense, soft, and fluffy carbonation. Hops immediately unleash a refined succulence, with a burst of mouth-filling oils and their zingy acids colliding with an appetizing assortment of fierce pepper and coarse herbs. Hop character is teemingly flavorsome, immeasurably deep in its purity, and chock full of sweet, bright nectars. Dusty, plastery yeast bolsters the lean core with a rustic signature which beautifully contrasts with the vividly defined, squeaky clean pils malt. Very lean and deceptively simple malt fills out the body with chewy starches, as does the creamy, plastery yeast. Sophisticated hoppiness continually captivates with a staggeringly complex fusion of lemon zest, flower petals, pepper, herbs, you name it. Immaculately attenuated finish showcases bouncy, lightly toasted hay textures underscored by an invigorating assortment of feisty, bracingly bitter hops and a spirited phenolic flourish. Another stunner from the folks at De Ranke. Much like XX Bitter in its unbridled hop onslaught, but with slightly more hop depth, if thats conceivable. This features all the hoppy elegance and succulence that only late-hopping can seem to achieve (why do so many brewers seem to favor dry-hopping when they can thoroughly coax bright aromatics and depth of flavor via the sole technique of late-hopping?). Elegant yet rustic; idiosyncratic but oh so focused. It truly mystifies how a hoppy golden beer at eight months of age can still brim with a vitality of this magnitude. But I suppose thats the magical thing about pedigreed Belgian yeast strains and the way some brewers knows how to work them, as they can handily  endure the rigors of oxidation like few others are able. I can only imagine what this must have been like uber fresh. Hell of a beer!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

971,"2013-08-25",4.8,"UPDATED: MAY 29, 2015 Draft through a few glasses to make a session. Lightly hazed effervescent gold with a fine-bubbled rocky white head. Persimmon, kiwifruit, sage, grass, flowers, apricot, orange blossom, lemon, basement must, almost-mold. Pithy strong bitterness and a dry pale malt core give this one an intense hoppiness that would be excessive for me if it the hops werent so vibrant and gloriously juicy, zingy and floral. Doughy / bready pale malt gives it the smell of an active bakery... De Ranke yeast once again gives this beer a softness and rusticity that is really rare to find in beer, not just Belgian ales. Soft body, creamy soft carbonation, bitter, off-dry, wonderfully expressive. Another winner for me on first taste, though I leave it open for bottle samples (i always assume that bottle fermentation gives Belgian beer added punch and life from the yeast). With how quiet nose is on this draft sample I cant wait to get a full effervescent pour from a fresh bottle. When they will show up in CO who knows. In short, it compares very well with XX but has noticeably more bitterness and thankfully little else different, at least not different enough to notice without doing a side by side. That will come if CO ever sees bottles. I do suspect that the draft pour is less yeasty, seems that way from what I recall of the last few batches of XX. I love De Ranke yeast but maybe I love its quieter character in this amazingly hopped Belgian blonde. (4.4)
