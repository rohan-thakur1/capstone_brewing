3776,"2016-05-27",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 25, 2016 Dark brown with medium light brown head. Aroma of dark chocolate, lots of coca, some roast, a hint of coffee, raisins, clove, little peach. Very interesting and complex. Taste is a nice mix of bitter and sweet, deep roasted stuff. Fits well to the aroma. A little spicyness as well. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth with very little carbonation. Full body. Overall really good.

Eye: Pours a murky dark brown color with a rather quickly dissipating beige head and medium carbonation.
Nose: sweets, ripe banana. Older dryed or baked fruit as plums or cherries and ""Coca Cola Frogs"" (we do have that in Switzerland).
Mouth: ripe banana as well, berries or other dark fruit.
Palate: coffee and toffee malts, yeast, banana as well but fresher; perhaps even banana bread. Fruitcake and pumpernickel bread. nuts as well.
Overall: very good Weizen Bock, decent amount of alcohol but surely not too much and well balanced between malts, hops and yeast; very well done.","Baden-Württemberg, GERMANY","Beerkenstock"

3776,"2015-03-17",4.0,"50cl bb07/2015, Oase MÜ. Quite a surprise to pour this inventively dubbed, hideously-labeled MacroPaulaner from the pedestrian bottle and notice: a pillowy maroon-mauve beer, perfumed like a stracciatella yoghurt bionatur, doused with plum wine and roast peanuts. Rich milk chocolate in taste, stracciatella sprinkles, almost a stout or at least a very HQ Doppelbock poured into a Weizenbock, while remaining medium-light, semi digestible. Light, dairy-light mouthfeel, radiant with chocolate malts and mild roast, obviously filling all the while. Pretty good stuff from an unexpected angle.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

Malty aroma of chocolate, banana, clove, nuts and dried plums. Sweetish taste of chocolote, banana, dark cherries, clove and a bit of coffee, coconut as well as nuts. Very nice! Sourish, slightly bitter finish with only minimal alcohol. Full body, creamy and smooth mouthfeel, average carbonation. Superb, complex weizenbock. So satisfying, with a massive creaminess and overwhelming tastiness. I just love weizenbocks and this is a good one!","Hagen / Bonn, GERMANY","Zlotta"
3776,"2015-03-09",3.5,"Oh, das war mal was recht Feines. Pulle vom Koelschtrinker mit Mc Tapps geteilt. Recht belgisch die ganze Geschichte mit feine Hopfen und ebenso feinem Weizen. Stellenweise etwas Vanille und Pflaume. Fluffig und herzhaft, dabei nie die Frucht aus den Augen verlierend. Sueffig und belebend. Absolut in Ordnung, wie fast jedes Paulaner auch.","Wanne-Eickel, GERMANY","MichaelAwesome"

Geruchlich erinnert es an ein belgisches Bier mit einer seifigen, blumigen Hefenote. Geschmacklich ist es äußerst lecker, jedoch auch (leider) immer noch etwas belgisch: Belgische Hefe, Nelken, Blumen, Hopfen und Brot. Blumiges und hefiges Ende.

Initially roasted malty and mildly wheaty taste with notes of caramel, bread crusts, as well as fruity flavours from the middle part, lingering into the finish with a present hoppy and roasty bitterness.

3776,"2014-12-28",2.9,"An interesting beer but not as drinkable as it sounds. Yes, it has elements of a dark Weizen, and some of the typical fruity traits mixed with roast notes are evident, but this is far less rounded than other special brews.

Fruchtig, bananig, aber nicht zu süß. Der Hopfen gibt eine gut balancierte Bittere dazu. Das Hopfenaroma dürfte durchaus noch kräftiger durchkommen, ist aber für den Bierstil durchaus im dunkelgrünen Bereich! Eike-Henrik Wagner & Friedrich Ampenberger haben da gezeigt, daß man auch in einer Großbrauerei große Biere brauen kann.
