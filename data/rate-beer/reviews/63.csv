63,"2015-12-25",3.8,"On tap @ Tampa Bay Brewing. Rich amber colored beer with a thin white head. Huge vanilla and clove. Quite intense. A good bit of ginger and nutmeg as well. The flavor and mouthfeel have a little bit of that grainy, dried spice quality to it, but pretty smooth and creamy otherwise. Good sweetness of caramel and toasted malts. Solid pumpkin beer, if you like that sort of thing.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
63,"2015-11-20",4.2,"Pours a brown-amber with a medium light tan head. Aroma is something akin to pumpkin pie & root beer. The individual spices within the aroma are latent but beautiful with nutmeg & clove - smells awesome. Taste is identical and smooth. This is not as sweet as it smells, but the spices are definitely the stars. I dont get pumpkin and not necessarily pumpkin pie either, but I do get something appropriate for the season. Well done and unique.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","S_Side_Smitty"
63,"2015-03-06",4.3,"Growler during RBWG. Pours a clear copper orange with small white head. The aroma is cinnamon and spice. Thin mouth, light spice and pumpkin, sugary finish, one of the best all around pumpkin beers ive ever tried.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"

63,"2013-11-03",3.6,"On draft at Cajun Cafe Fall Beer Fest 2013. Pours a nice hazy orange color with a white head. Distributor poured me a glass of foam and I had to let it settle. Nose is some candied pumpkin, some light pie spices, some sweet malt, and some sugar. Flavor is similar with roasted pumpkin, some pie spices, some sugar, and some light ginger. Medium in body and a nice pumpkin beer overall.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"

63,"2013-10-20",4.2,"Growler... RBWG 2013 This beer rocks! Dirty orange ale with a small, tight, off-white head. The spice-rack aroma is a swirl of nutmeg, cinnamon, chai tea, graham and pumpkin meat. Medium to full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and tingly carbonation. The flavor is pretty much what this beers nose promised  loads of spice-rack and gourdy goodness. Well-balanced  not overly sweet or overly bitter. Finishes toasty and spicy. Big-time thanks goes out to burg326 for sharing this exceptional pumpkin beer!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

63,"2013-02-28",3.9,"Growler thanks to, you guessed it, burg326 at the RBWG Grand Tasting Jax, FL.   Pours  a watered down amber with a small off white head.  Nose  shows sweet potato, gourd, pumpkin, light cinnamon and brown sugar.  Flavor is similar--this is easily the best pumpkin tasting beer I have had.  I might still enjoy parcela more for its funky JP yeast, but this beer had incredibly nice pumpkin/gourd fruit flavor without being too bitter or vegetal, or what have you.  Sounds like others liked it as well.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

63,"2012-10-24",3.7,"Color was a dark red with a small white head. Aroma was spiced and sweet, mostly a sugary nutmeg. Taste is nutmeg and cinnamon with a nice level of sweetness, but too much spice. Palate was a little watery and would have been enhanced by a little more carbonation.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","jnkor"

63,"2012-09-30",4.0,"On draft at the Brass Tap, poured a deep brown/orangish color, aromas of pumpkin, spice, light nutmeg, and some sugar.  Flavors are the same light sweetness on the palate, not overly pumpkiny, but has a little of crust, and some light roasted malt to it as well.  A nice interpretation of this style, could easily drink this all day with out getting sick of it.","Florida, USA","burg326"
