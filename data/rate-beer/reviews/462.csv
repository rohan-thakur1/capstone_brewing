Taste is sweet-ish but never cloying with chocolate and coffee aplenty, moderate fruitiness, maple notes, vanilla and little to no bitterness. Medium body. Moderate to medium carbonation.

Barrel aged coffee? To quote Cartman, that whole concept has warped my fragile little mind, and may well necessitate a fundamental change to breakfast as I know it. (Apparently they sell the coffee through their web site? Ordered!) Huge coffee notes dominate over dark chocolate and oaky bourbon, but neither come across as harsh or overwhelming. Visually impressive, this thing is as utterly black as a politicians heart, with no relief at all around the margins. (The label claims 45 SRM, and I believe it. I thought the Standard Reference Method scale topped out at 40, but this is definitely the inkiest black brew Ive ever seen.) And yet, surprisingly smooth and mild, with very restrained bitterness. Do what you gotta do to lay hands on this. Its better to get forgiveness than permission. (18/20)

462,"2017-04-09",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 21, 2017 I have heard about a new trend of using coffee beans aged in wooden barrels and this allegedly was the first one to do that, curious about this. Medium thick, moussy, pale beige, stable head, well retaining around the edge, black robe with hazy burgundy edges. Refined bouquet of real coffee beans and coffee powder, espresso, liquorish, bitter chocolate, sugared black tea, hazelnut paste, aniseed, bayleaf, cigars, dry leather, cinnamon rolls, vanilla beans, light bourbon, dried thyme. Clean fruity onset, hints of dried fig and unripe pear, touch of leathery umami and some dim elderberry sourishness, softish carbo, pleasantly oily and creamy, slick mouthfeel. Very nutty malt body with a bitterish toasted edge, blending beautifully with the uplifting notes of high quality coffee powder towards the finish without turning deeply roasted bitter, some spicy hops way back but not outspoken (unsurprisingly at only 30 IBU), leathery and teaish accents, dryish, with the coffee lingering alongside a bitter chocolatey end maltiness and a dash of warming, well-positioned alcohol. I do not quite get barrel ageing here - if only the added coffee and not the beer itself has aged on bourbon barrels, this effect can only be subtle - so I am left wondering a bit what the point of this novelty is, but in general this is a very well-balanced, refined, highly drinkable and beautiful stout without any flaws.

462,"2017-02-12",3.9,"Bomber of first-time-brewed version, purchased right at two years ago at Trader Joes in Escondido ($8.99). POURS just shy of pitch black with a full finger layer of creamy light brown foam. AROMA of ashy malts, dark roasted coffee, creamy/milky vanilla, and roasted nuts. FLAVOR of artisanal roasted coffee (maybe cold brew?), hard roasted dark malts, some fudge (only slightly sweetened), with a hit of the bourbon right at the finish. Finishes with moderate to strong sweetness and some roasty-bitterness. Full bodied especially for a stout that does not quite venture into the ""imperial"" category. I had expected and hoped for more bourbon presence, but I wonder if the bourbon may have dropped out some in the two years this was in my cellar (or was never much there in the first place since it was the beans that were barrel aged).

Light to medium bodied for the flavours employed, average carb.

Almost outstanding, but light, nose of chocolate with a touch of coffee over a light malt base.

Light full bodied with a creamy texture that almost coats the tongue. World class carbonation / body balance that supports the creamy texture. Middle effervescence is a tickle while the finish is prickly.

The flavor profile is quite outstanding, with a bit more intensity and more complexity it would be world class. It begins with a blend of coffee and chocolate that slowly shits to coffee focused then flows to bakers chocolate focused in the middle. Neither flavor falls off the map, they just jostle for center stage. The middle provides a subtle underlying sweetness and a light coffee based bitterness. These flavors flow into the finish with chocolate receding and coffee lingering over a light oak note.

A steady pour into my glass produces a two-finger thick, creamy textured, brown tinged, dark tan colored head. The beer is a concentrated brown, almost black color that is opaque when held up to the light. The aroma is quite interesting, clearly dominated by the coffee, but it is so smooth, mellow, despite being pervasive, with a smooth coffee melding fruitiness (is this the Bourbon Barrel influence), somewhat green smelling, a bit woody, but with lots of toasted, caramelized, dark nut leaning, smooth roasted coffee character. Supporting notes of toasted / roasted, whole grain bread, Nut accentuating malt notes, and perhaps a touch of cocoa character are contributed by the malt.

Lightly sweet up front, the beer finishes dry and roasted though. The body is quite light, even for a beer of this strength, and the bitter, roasted, astringent notes in this beer seem to lighten up the medium body that would be here otherwise. The finish has a lingering, bitter, woody, astringent, not quite charcoal character to it, that begs you to take another. Up front there are soft, dark chocolate notes, burnt nut flavors, smoother roasted caramelized coffee notes, toasted brown sugar (without any real sweetness), and rounded, dusty cocoa flavors. 

This is an interesting beer, the unique coffee character comes out more in the nose than it does in the flavor; in fact the Bourbon barrel itself (Bourbon and woody oak) seems distinguishably noticeable in the nose, while it is more of a suggestion in the flavor. This is definitely an experience, but in the end it is a bit too dominated by the coffee (I would prefer more of the rich Stout to have more of a say here) for my personal preference, but I am definitely interested to try this coffee at some point.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

462,"2015-04-26",3.8,"Ive been looking at this bottle for a long while; it sat patiently in my cellar, cool as a cucumber and taunted me every day with the words on the bottle...coffee, oak, bourbon; certainly a craft beer trifecta!
The beer is opened, the aroma is coffee with a bite. A well tempered bourbon is aromatically apparent in the air above the glass as I pour, and a rich latte colored head rises and caps the deep brown liquid. I can see it is short-lived, soft and permeable.
The glass tips, the beer wets my bottom lip and I draw my first sip, breathing in as I pull the beer over my tongue. The bourbon turns to a hot vanilla on the nose and I feel a tightness on my gums as the liquid streams through my mouth. A roasted coffee flavor comes around, more deeply as I sip, the dryness appropriate to the flavor but a slight bitterness comes at me from behind. I find the higher temperature adds a bit of chocolate to the flavor profile and the combination becomes even more sophisticated as times wears on.
The foam atop the beer is slight at this point, and leaves wet traces of itself on the glass. Not lacing, more like stretch marks...
A moderate body with a comfortable level of carbonation helps the flavor punctuate the sultry bourbon taste and the short, but exceedingly sexy finish. A very nice experience, and one I would have as often as possible. If Modern Times wanted to send me one of everything...Id have this twice. Yes. Thank you very much.","USA","lightbias"
462,"2015-04-21",4.1,"22 ounce bottle into snifter; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and rocky tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice desne soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toffee, toast, dark bread, nuttiness, vanilla, light bourbon, smoke/char, herbal, floral, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roast/bready malt, coffee, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toffee, toast, dark bread, nuttiness, vanilla, light bourbon, smoke/char, herbal, floral, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of roast/char and herbal hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toffee, toast, dark bread, nuttiness, vanilla, light bourbon, smoke char, herbal, floral, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready malt, coffee, light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent coffee Foreign stout style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready malt, coffee, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
462,"2015-04-19",4.4,"Initially, I was confused by City of the Dead. Wheres the bourbon burn from the barrel-aging? Why isnt the ABV higher? Then, I realized that only the coffee beans are barrel-aged. Instead of feeling betrayed, I was greatly impressed by the results of this idea. City of the Dead (cool name, by the way) is a marvelously balanced Stout. The cocoa, coffee, and malts impart their aromas and flavors harmoniously. While Id like to get some bourbon-like vanilla notes, I love this beers depth of taste and lack of bitterness. Id love to see some more variants of this Stout. Modern Times has crafted a supremely drinkable Foreign Stout.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Poured an almost pitch black color with two fingers of darker tan, rocky head. Good amount of semi-layered, foamy lacing on the sides of the glass. Above average, swirly, retention on the top all the way down. (Sight - 3.88)

Smelled rich coffee beans, dark chocolate, cocoa powder, toffee, caramel, roasty malts, vanilla, chocolate syrup, roasted nuts, smoky campfire and smoky bourbon late. (Smell - 4.13)

Tasted pretty damn good. Got those rich, dark, coffee malts up front, initially with a creamy, milky finish. Digging deeper I got dark chocolate, dark cocoa nibs, light bourbon, bitter dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, crayon, roasty nuts, chocolate syrup and faint vanilla. Barrel-aged coffee seems to have a different taste than a regular barrel-aged stout. (Taste - 4.00)

Full body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, bitter finish. Doesnt taste 7.5 percent. Definitely the best part. (Feel - 4.25)

This was an OK beer and, really for the price, a good deal. Id probably get a sixer of this for the value. (Overall - 4.00)

462,"2015-03-24",4.2,"22 oz bottle acquired via trade on BA. Thanks, bro! An extra from a large sour focused trade, this is very welcomed. Pours a thicker blackish opaque pour, brownish ruby glow emanates from the bottom and edges. Cakey brownish head atop stays as a decent firm layer, good retention and lacing overall. Aromas are richly and decadently coffee laden. Firm roasty and earth meet jabs of fruit, touches of wood and espresso. Distinct dark fruit and sweet quality comes into play, caramel and toffee meet plum and a waft of black cherry. Firmer nuttiness, toast, and toffee meet some luscious vanilla smoothed out sweetness. Initial is medium bodied, a bit more full as silky vanilla, creamy malts, espresso glide over the palate. Nutty malts, coffee and gentle oak meet some creaminess, vanilla and toasty carmelized glow. Nougat, chopped nuts and rich espresso and coffee depth pervade the senses. Cocoa nibs, rich coffee character is roasty, nutty and just lovely. A firmer roasty backend as we get past the barrel and silky sweeter malts up front. Back is dry, bitter, toasty and cocoa nibs. Touches of ash and roast, earth and coffee ground bitterness taper out. While a firmer stout base, the coffee and additions here transform this, making this glide over the palate at times without getting away from that distinct and yearned for coffee/roasty complexity and bitterness as we finish. This is just lovely stuff without being too big or brooding. A beer that integrates the coffee well, lets it shine at times. This is a gem as far as Im concerned.

462,"2015-03-23",4.2,"The beer is black to the edges. It needs to get pretty thin before some brown comes out. The head is full and creamy, puffs up nicely at the initial pour. Lots of lacing. Excellent retention. The aroma is like a rich, fruity cup of coffee next to a slice of chocolate cake. Theres a light, sweet bourbon note, mostly vanilla. Toasty malt sweetness, nutty caramel. Cherries, stone fruit and mint in the coffee. The taste is sweet and rich without growing overbearing. Coffee and dark malt sweetness abound. My only light criticism is that the lower abv doesnt quite round off the roast and coffee acidity as much as Id prefer. Still, this is easy to drink. Finishes with moderate bitterness, but its fudge and vanilla and fancy coffee all through. Creamy, full feel. Drinks big for its abv but little booze, just lots of flavor. Really, really nice stuff.

462,"2015-01-31",4.2,"Bomber, dropped this week. Im gonna try to pick up more is my first and most important comment. MT brews beer and roasts coffee, including their crazy barrel-aged coffee program that provided the beans in this beer -- and this is a collab of those efforts. Thats saying plenty, but I have more. Pours about black with a big dark beige head. I actually have the bourbon coffee beans I assume they used in here and I can pick em out on the nose. As offer they are bit strong for a morning drink but as a complement to a stout theyre wonderful. Nose is coffee stout with a little something extra. Bourbon notes come through more on the taste but not on a boozy way -- perfect. So much fresh coffee. Taste? Hard to put into words but near perfection. I dont love huge stouts for the most part, so sneaking some BB notes in like this is A-OK with me -- and particularly well done here. Modern Times started off strong and is only getting better if you ask me.","Valley Village, California, USA","Ontape"

>> MT City of the Dead. Clear deep brown pour with healthy tan foam with perfect lacing, great retention. Nose is incredible baked blackberry pie, fresh artisanal cold brew coffee, dark chocolate brownie, extreme depth of coffee aroma that isnt roasty, acrid, earthy/dirty. Taste is super silky smooth, robust coffee, medium to high bitterness, no coffee acid, no coffee thinness. Not really even roasty, sharp. More blackberry pie dessert like. This may be my favorite beer from MT and easily the best beer Ive had in awhile. Going to stock up.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
