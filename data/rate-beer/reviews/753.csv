753,"2014-09-03",4.1,"Transfer from BA review on 3-19-13-
 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

 Appearance  The beer is served a brown colored brew with a one finger off white head. The head fades relatively quickly to leave a moderate level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is heaviest of a bready nature with tons of rye and a wheat smell. Mixed with these more malty aromas is a good sweet caramel smell as well as a moderate presence of some citrus an earthy hop smells.

 Taste  The taste begins with a nice rye flavor which creates a base for the other flavors of the brew. Mixed with the rye upfront, there is a rather nice mix of hop flavors- some earthy, grapefruit citrus, and herbal tastes. The flavor sweetens ever so slightly with a caramel flavor coming to the tongue at the middle of the taste. This fades more toward the end where more bitter citrus hop of grapefruit, some lemongrass, and grassy flavors become even more pronounced. The hop never becomes too potent but provides a nice balance to the rye malt flavors of the brew to, in the end, leave a pleasant lightly hopped rye flavor on the tongue..

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the slightly thinner side with a carbonation level that is average to just above average. Both make for a rather crisp feel on the tongue and are rather nice for the mix of hop and rye that are present in the brew.

 Overall  This is a great, rather rye potent brew, with a nice hop profile and balance for the more malty and rye flavors of the brew. Quite tasty and a good drinker.","","Darkmagus82"

753,"2014-05-03",4.0,"Pint can. Nose is partly dull, partly spritely, rye on caramel with light citrus and nice CTZ-style hops.

Body is thin but not watery, very smooth and really creamy. Taste semi-dry with light but ""there"" bitterness, though just barely; basic American hops that are somewhat woody and dank, earthy, but not heavy on the citrus or pine. Clean and balanced throughout.  Rye is more of an accent here but everythings tailored to meet its needs, if that makes any sense.

753,"2014-04-20",3.6,"473 ml. can. BBD 27 MAR 2014. Pours a medium, well retained, ivory head with attractive lacing, over a very slightly hazy medium amber (SRM 15) body....nose is rye cereal, hints of treacle from the malts, light pine, hints of citrus from the hops, minimal esters.....taste is malt dominant, slightly sweet, with rye spice tones, lighter hops with pine, resin, light citrus notes, finishing bitter, minimal esters.....mouth feel, medium body, slightly sticky, minimal alcohol, no astringency, light acid on finish. This particular can was 3 weeks beyond its BBD. Additionally it had not been refrigerated, as requested on the can. It is, those considered, a nice beer. The malts may have been a bit more dominant than when it is fresher, because hops do lose their subtle floral, and more complex citrus notes as they age. There were no pineapple or apricot notes indicative of quite elderly hops, so I think the beer is probably close to its natural aromas and flavors. BJCP 7/3/15/4/7","Salida, Colorado, USA","drjay44"

753,"2014-03-17",3.6,"Rcvd in trade.
The appearance has a hazy golden amber colored body with less than a half fingered white foamy head that when it dies theres a nice clingy lacing that coats the entire glass.
The smell has a nice rye malt coming through (nice even though this is a month past its prime). Spicy malt tries to come through to combine with the hops, but has a sort of separateness to it.
The taste has a nice spice to it, yet theres still a nice sweetness coming through. There isnt much of an aftertaste and has a somewhat dry spicy finish.
On the palate, honestly, there really doesnt seem much there, sure theres a light sort of body to it (did it subside due to its age....? I dunno). However, I will say its sessionable - sure is as Id have this with food. Carbonation is a bit smoother than most Rye Beers Ive had.
Overall, Id like to try this again fresher because I think this one could definitely be a front runner of its style, just a month past its prime and I still liked it for the most part.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

A: Copper brown ale with less than a single finger of peanut foam which falls slowly to a sheet of the same. Nice ring on sheet lacing. Limited clarity with red hues along the lightlines.

S: The rye seems pretty strong here. The hops are present, and remind me of hay, and grass. Hints of grapefruit. Malt profile is biscuity and sweet.

T: What strikes me first is the spicy-sour rye, which is well balanced with sweet malts and bitter, earthy hops. This is well balanced, and actually reminds me of a well done ESB. Has a herbal tone as well.

M: Creamy and medium bodied with lower carb. Appropriate for this beer. Finish is slightly creamy and slick with longevity.

O: Well done beer. I would prefer this on a fall evening where the air is cool and clammy, this would suit that setting well. With the malt bill on this, I think an imperial version would be quite appealing and have high cellar potential.

Generous rye and its inherent spiciness envelops this bulky IPAs leafy hop resins, leaving room for some floral notes and grassy edges.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A frothy head of foam tops the cloudy russet.
-The flavor profile remains balanced.
-The flavor profile lacks definition, but theres plenty of flavor to be found.
-Hop bitterness is also a tad earthy.
-This feels like an older-generation Québécois IPA, if you know what that means.

The malt is full and has plenty of bread to carry the spice of the rye and the hop qualities to the back palate where they settle with a good bitter. The honey sweetness of the malt is modest and there is excellent balance between all the bold flavors and the fullness of the malt. Body is rich but drinks pleasant and light. Ample carbonation. 

Many people shy away from brown ales because they find them boring or bland. Well this beer will change all that. The hop qualities keep the palate interested and the gently sweet malt keeps it satisfied. The rye makes this beer. It is so well done and really shines with its touch of sour alongside a perfect citrus tartness. Bold refreshing and brawny.","New York, USA","pinkie"

TECHNICAL: Can. Poured a dark, reddish amber that was nearly brown in the glass with an average, tan head that mostly diminished and left excellent lacing. The aroma was a little weak compared to the flavor, but it contained moderate to heavy dark bread, grain and rye; slight caramel; light to moderate pine, citrus and citrus rind hops; and cola. The initial flavor was light to moderately sweet, slightly acidic, and lightly bitter; while the finish was lightly sweet, moderately acidic, heavily bitter and slightly sour with a long duration. There was dark bread, rye, grain, caramel, cola, citrus and pine hops, sour rye, grapefruit and lemon.

Poured after long day outside.  Eating and drinking earlier...so not best palate

Dark brown, cloudy.  foamy head of dark cream that takes awhile to settle.  Like the look 

Not too much on nose, but malt, rye, and candied sugar come through.

First time in this style, but I dig it!  Low-ish alcohol and not sure what I was expecting, but this is not a 'big' beer, but it really doesn't need to be.  Tiny bit sour, tiny bit dry- not as much sweetness as on nose.    Rye bitterness is there but it's pleasant.  Though aftertaste perhaps a touch too dry and bitter

Never been a fan of brown ales, and this is certainly very different.  Don't need more than one, but it's tasty.  Would have again.

753,"2012-02-04",3.5,"First Sixpoint beer Ive been able to find locally, wasnt real sure of the style until looking. It definitely comes through as a Rye IPA, but with more malt character and a unexpected dry finish. Sixpoint is doing a really good job at pushing the boundaries of style like so many others are doing these days.","Mechanicsville, Maryland, USA","newbrewguy"
753,"2012-02-03",4.3,"Sixpoint is known for making beers that are hard to classify and Righteous Ale is no exception. Billed as a rye beer with a lot of hops, its probably best described as a Rye IPA. But that isnt even completely accurate since most beers of the sort tend to be very dry, overly bitter, and lightly malty. This beer is juicy, sweet, and resiny from tons of hops, but with a distinct rye bite. 

I poured a 16oz can into a nonic pint glass.

Appearance: Hazy brown proper with a slight shade of maroon. Forms a large, white, creamy head which laces and retains wonderfully.

Smell: Very resiny hops with hints of citrus syrup and a pleasant astringency of what beer nerds refer to as ""cat piss"" (Simcoe hops tend to impart this scent, but Im not sure what hops are in this beer). Theres also a distinct rye presence, although light - like rye bread from across the room. 

Taste: The palate begins somewhat mild biscuity malt dryness. It quickly transitions to a maltier taste of rye bread with hints of caramel, but still manages to throw in a little spicy bite. Its quite earthy-tasting, almost like licking raw tea leaves or the bark of a pine tree (while that may not sound like a good thing, in the case of Righteous Ale it definitely is).

The second half turns on a dime into a sweet nectar or syrup-like taste, which then gives way to a delightfully astringent resin bitterness. Theres a brief, but noticeable taste of citrus, pine sap, and sharp dry bitterness like a salted pretzel. All these flavors are distinct, but meld together perfectly. The bitterness and overall hop presence perhaps outshines the rye component of the palate, but the ryes light spicy flavor really helps to balance out this beer and make it rather unique. Its tasty for sure, but not quite mind-blowing (impressive though).

Drinkability: Some beers are energetic because of their effervescence, but Sixpoint Righteous Ale is energetic because of its palate. A high amount of flavor happening here: a complex, but well balanced palate of rye spice, hop bitterness and malty sweetness. It crackles across the tongue, but goes down  smooth. And as bitter as it seems, it never dries me out or wears down my palate. Im actually quite impressed they got so much flavor into a 6.3% ABV body. It drinks like something heavier, though, as I could feel it immediately. But it would be the kind of beer Id drink two in row of because its so good.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
753,"2012-02-02",3.7,"Can: Poured a brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of spicy rye malt with solid hosp presence.

A - Poured sternly into a DogfishHead glass. produced a 1.5 finger head that was cream color with a milky top and lots of little bubbles. The beer itself is a very deep mahogany. its dark with just hints of amber. The head subsided in about 90 seconds.

S - Vanilla, burnt malts, rye barrels like some more refined whiskey smells Id get from a whiskey. Banana but it may just be the really sweet rye smell.

T - Right on the first sip, there are some delicious hops just exploding all over the place and theyre a very floral / piney taste but theyre calmed down by the rye and sweeter aspects that take over.

M - Nicely carbonated and not over taking at all. The beer lingers a while and its easy to drink quickly or sip. Just nice and delicious mouthfeel!

Aroma: The nose has some rye to it, earth, caramel notes, some hoppy notes, citrus, spice, and grains

Appearance: This one pours a caramel color into the glass

Flavor: The taste is relatively dry, not too much sweetness, some earthy and grainy notes

Palate: A medium bodied beer, the mouthfeel is sort of cereal-like

Overall Impression: 
This is a pretty decent rye ale.  A good feel to it, and its pretty drinkable.  It has that good cereal-like feel to it, which works pretty well with the flavors.

Hazy brown-copper color that poured with a frothy white head. Fantastic lacing throughout the sample. Sweet maltiness followed up with the very present rye. Solid hop bitterness that was kinda earthy followed by fresh fruit aromas. Smooth maltiness to start off followed up by the rye, and then a smack of hop bitterness. Really dry hoppy finish that polishes off the smooth sweetness in the beginning. Medium MF, and it was both pleasantly palate coating and rich.

Medium bodied with a lot of dry earthy pine hops which are quickly balanced but a very dry earthy pine bitterness that lasts throughout over a sweet malt backbone into a bone dry finish.  Hints of caramel malt with biscuit and rye.  Very hoppy for the style and  not very well balanced with a lot of dry bitterness completely overpowering the sweet rye malt.  The ABV is decently masked and this  beer is pretty drinkable but the hops outshine the sweetness from the malt too much for my liking.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Hazy mahogany red color. Big fluffy , good, slow carbonation from the pint-sized can. Spotty specks of lace.

The taste mirrors the aroma and has the citrus hops up front with light grapefruit and lemon flavors giving way to the caramel malt base.  The rye come one with a vengeance in the finish with spiciness lingering between sips.

753,"2006-04-18",3.3,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2006 Have had this twice on tap now.  Once at Burp Castle and once at Jimmys.  Poured into a pint glass with half inch head.  Orange color, can see through the beer. Nothing distinct in the aroma.  The body is light, watered down actually.  No distinct flavors coming through.  Nothing off-putting but nothing special either.  Suprised its this strong, felt like a regular 5-6% brew. RERATE 5/7/06 - had on Tap at Liberty Heights Tao Room as a part of the Sixpoint tour (try it).  This time the beer was very different, I do not know why.  Translucent orange, but I couldnt see through the beer.  Aroma is moderatly floral and pot-like.  Leaves a sweet aftertaste.  Im raising the score a bit.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
753,"2006-02-26",3.5,"tap from the Liberty Heights Tap Room in Brooklyn: cloudy reddish-brown color with a mild off-white head which disappears quickly. No noticeable lacing, but perhaps thats because I was drinking it from a plastic cup! Piney hop, doughy yeast and sweet malt aromas. Taste is full and malty at first, then the hops kick in with a nice punch. Bitter in the finish. Went quite well with a sausage and onion pizza.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","jgeiman"
753,"2006-01-21",3.6,"(Tap)  Rye flavor abounds.  The beer is extraordinarily cloudy and yeasty.  The alcohol astringence is also evident.  Heavy, fairly malty and sweet, yet it finishes bitterly.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"
753,"2005-12-05",3.5,"On tap at the Liberty Heights Tap Room, Redhook, Brooklyn, NY.  Hazy brown rye ale having a small diminishing head and spare lacing.  No discernable carbonation.  Fresh sweet malt and hop aromas. Medium bodied that starts with slightly sweet malt and hoppy flavor and finishes with lingering bitterness.  A very good drinkable ale.","Libertyville, Illinois, USA","beervana"
753,"2005-10-29",3.5,"This one came across as overly sweet to me, but that might be because I had their IPA before I tried this - complex notes of chocolate, caramel, nuttiness - tempered with some slight bittering hops, light and dark fruit (orange, plum?) - rye makes its presence known - pretty decent.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
753,"2005-10-11",3.8,"Malty, hoppy aroma - very nice.  Cloudy brown with a big tan head.  medium-heavy hopping, edgy acidity but it goes down smoothly.  Finishes a little boozywith a hefty hop aftertaste.  Almost salty sometimes.  This went really well with the Liberty Heights tap house calzone.  Good craftbrew.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"
753,"2005-09-12",3.4,"On draught at Sunset Grille, 9/10/2005 (pre-mead tasting).  Fair enough pour, dark amber-to-light-chestnut brown with a small but well-retained yellowish-beige head, unfiltered.  Aroma is fruity, nutty, floral and has hints of soily-earthy yeast.  Light chocolate perhaps, with oranges and grapefruits.  Flavor is a pretty straightforward RyePA.  Amped up hops bitterness overpowers the flavor, but some sweet oranges, light tropical fruits and a dry, grainy, caramel malt and light biscuits/breadiness.  Quite dry on the finish (well, dry through most of the beer, actually) with plenty of hops complexity, but relatively lacking on the malt side, I thought.  Mouthfeel is lightly astringent, papery and dry, but still unfiltered and thus there is at least something there to chew on.  Lots of rye.  I enjoyed it, but I must say that Ive had better rye beers.  Founders Reds Rye and Willimantic Rye carry the same hops bitterness but add much more juicy flavors and seem to have better body.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
753,"2005-08-29",3.8,"Very hoppy, very sweet ale with a fairly high alcohol content. Mellow aftertaste and very delicious.","Westchester, New York, USA","PBOYNY"
753,"2005-05-30",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 31, 2005 Cloudy caramel, fairly dark, fine sediment floaties, large sandy foamy head, lovely lacing, soft carbonation.   Floral oriented candy-sweet nose, hints of apple skin, subtle charred wood, and a touch of brett.   An odd duck when it comes to aroma.   Earthy/Musty hop bitterness on the start, slight pine, and extremely dry.   Very quick finish, earthy/musty hop notes remain.   Great body and mouthfeel, albeit a bit too spritzy.   Lingering alder tree like flavor.   I think this one had too much going on... needs to be simplified a bit me thinks.   Good start, but requires less earth and more hop/rye assertiveness.    I wonder what yeast they used too?","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
753,"2005-05-28",3.6,"Cloudy dark amber colour.  Big, fluffy, light caramel head.  Woody, lightly citric aroma with some sort of crystal/munich malt.  Toasty, earthy character with breadcrusty notes, spicy rye and a fairly bitter finish.  At times surprisingly chewy.  Distinctive if a little unpolished.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
753,"2005-05-16",3.9,"Cask @ Brazen Head. One of the better beers at Brazen Head that night. This poured gold with a nice sized head. Nice citrus, floral hoppy nose. Taste is nicely balanced. Somehow I taste a little salt.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
