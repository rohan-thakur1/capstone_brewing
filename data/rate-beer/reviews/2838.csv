Aroma - got some grass upfront. More I focused on aroma, more I was getting a lemongrass feel.

2838,"2015-07-12",4.0,"In recent years Ive become more impressed with American breweries making traditional, to-spec Czech and German-style pilsners. These arent easy brews to make, especially without Americanizing them, so a good one is much appreciated by me. Thats why I really enjoyed Firestone Walker Pivo Hoppy Pils, which, despite the name, is not an IPL or especially hoppy for the style. Spicy, dry, clean and refreshing  thats what I want in a pilsner.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a pilsner glass. It was bottled on 4/13/15 and cost $2.85 ($0.24 per ounce). 

Appearance: Pale lemon-skin yellow hue with slight cloudiness. Pours to a small, bright white, foamy head which laces and retains very well. Spastic carbonation is always visible.

Smell: Spicy/slight skunky Noble hops though pilsner malt is quite prominent and creates for a graham cracker-like scent too.

Taste: Theres essentially just two flavor combinations happening in this palette: raw pilsner maltiness up front and spicy hops with dry bitterness up on the backend. It simple and repetitive, yes, but because these flavors are so enjoyable I never get tired of them. The malt character is classic, cracker-like in nature (a combination of wheat and graham crackers if that makes sense) with the Noble hops imparting a strong spicy sensation on the finish. I detect a hint of lemon lollipop, though that could be due to the fact this bottle is rather old at nearly 3 months (oxidation). Though the hops dont seem to have faded at all  I really like the zesty flavor they create. Overall, this is a more-than-solid pilsner palette that can be enjoyed by anyone.

Drinkability: What makes for a good pilsner isnt just the flavor, but also the easy drinkability. Firestone Walker Pivo Hoppy Pils is exactly what you want in the style: a crisp, well-carbonated mouthfeel thats in no way thin or abrasive. Refreshing while in the mouth, it does leave a bit of a spicy/starchy aftertaste, though it fades rather quickly and is tolerable anyway. Perhaps a bit big at 5.3% ABV since thats a bit too heavy to be considered a session beer by most drinkers. Still, no one is going to have a problem throwing back a few of these on a hot day. The fact its also available in cans is a great selling point.

It is of the typical Pilsner car piss variety, only slightly better smelling than Budweiser. Appearance is golden with a large white bubbly head that leaves a lot of lacing. The latter is what makes it look different from most pilsners. Taste is very refreshing with hints of banana peel. Palate is solid. Overall I would say great for the style and well made, but I would rather have just about any IPA, imperial stout or barleywine. Probably the best Pilsner around, but most of us have graduated on to bigger and better things.

Perfectly clear, pastel yellow with a fine near-white head and very good lacing.  The color is a turnoff, but the head, lacing and bubbles are nice.  Still, a good beer should not look like diluted p***. 

Aroma of lemon, orange, bread, crackers, herbs and grass.  The aroma elements, other than the citrus, are nice, but fairly subtle. 

Taste of lemon and orange citrus, cereal (like puffed barley, if existed would taste), biscuits and a surprisingly sweet element I cannot quite describe.

The finish is an almost chaotic melange of various hop varieties, and after a few beers they end up getting somewhat thick on the tongue-- until the next lovely sip. This is definitely a well-made beer and very enjoyable, but without the unmistakable presence of a true Noble hops profile, the finish is not nuanced or sophisticated, and thereby this is not a true German Pils.

Taste is crisp cracker maltiness, thick Carrs water biscuits and youre int he ballpark. Add to that a firm hop bitterness that lingers on the back of the tongue and a slight smoothness that avoids the bitterness overpowering the rest of the beer. Medium bodied, dangerously easy to drink. Very, very nice and destined to be a regular in the fridge.","Gordonsville, Virginia, USA","Velkyal"

Nose is beautifully noble, brightly citric and grassy with light musty funk/hay, a touch toasty with malty background, and theres a touch of that elusive spaghetti sauce character I seem to be the only one able to detect. Just a touch floral. Pours ultra-clear pale yellow with a short soapy bright white head. Very crisp and lightly soapy medium body refreshes, leaves a touch of bread in the finish and light bitterness with a slight chalky coating. Semi-sweet but lent the feel of more dryness by the bitterness; floral, med-strong spicy, strongly grassy, and the medium citrus very fresh and vibrant. A distinct minerally character actually not clashing with the soapy hops, and the zesty lemon-orange leaders are just dynamite. Bitterness, like the beer overall, is clean, and the oversimplified malt still manages to do its job. A great one for America.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

2838,"2015-04-04",4.8,"The first thing that hit me, (and made me smile), was the color. Stout is my preferred style of beer so I naturally drink a lot of dark, heavy, full-bodied ales. This one poured out a solid 3 SRM, which brought a smile to my face. Well done guys. Firestone Walker recommends drinking this no more than 120 days from their ""Bottled on"" date and I cracked this bottle open on day 144, (an oversight to be sure). So there wasnt as much carbonation as would be expected but it still put any of the big 3 adjunct lagers to shame. The nose was pleasant and subtle. The hops were there, but not in an in your face (Simcoe®) kind of way. My first impression of the taste was balanced. You can taste the hops and the malt, but neither one is over powering or competing with the other. Very light mouth feel. As a stout drinker Im tempted to say it was watery. But I dont think thats accurate. In fact when I decided to write this review I had to really focus on the style of beer I was drinking, and make sure Im not judging it by another styles standards. For what this beer was crafted to be, it delivers. In my humble opinion it hits all the benchmarks of a German Pilsner, (with a twist). The marketing seems to be that this is a hoppy pilsner, and while that is accurate, it is also misleading. The bitterness is well balanced in this beer. The hops are there, but Im not sure I would define this as a hop forward or even hoppy beer. Its a well balanced German Pilsner with some interesting layers. Very enjoyable beer.","Arizona, USA","sremed60"

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a crystal clear yellow-straw color with a big fizzy white head. The head has a decent level of retention but fades over time as large bubbles pop within, eventually disappearing and leaving a lighter level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is heaviest of a grainy smell mixed with some citrus lemon aromas. Along with these smells are some grassy and floral aromas as well as a bit of a biscuit and cracker like smells.

 Taste  The taste begins with a malty cracker like taste with a moderately strong showing of some lemon flavors and a bit of floral hops. Some lighter sweetness is present upfront which when mixed with the lemon give an almost lemonade like flavor. The light sweetness fades as the flavor advances with the taste becoming more dry toward the end. Along with the drying out of the taste, so too comes other hop flavors of a grassy and herbal nature. Furthermore a grainy taste comes to the tongue more toward the middle of the tongue with it getting more and more potent to the end of the flavor. With a little bit of the lemonade sweetness returning to the flavor once again at the very end, one is left with a nice lightly sweetened and hopped grainy flavor to be left on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average to slightly heavier side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is average. The thicker body of the brew helps accentuate the grainy and hop flavors quite well, really allowing these nice flavors to stand out on the tongue

 Overall  A rather pleasant and easy drinking pils. With a slightly higher hop profile then the typical pilsner this is a nice switch up from the standard.","","Darkmagus82"

This was poured into a pilsener. 
The appearance was a nice looking somewhat transparent yellow color with a two finger lasting head. When the head was about at least four fingers, it mushroom capped and fell at a nice pace leaving a really nice semi thick foamy white lacing. Carbonation was seen rising at a moderate pace to keep the two fingers of head a bit longer. 
The smell had some lightly toasted bready malts coming through in a sweet way. In the background, a light crisp spicy hops maintains for balance. 
The taste was mainly sweet and had a decent crisp toasty bready make up. The aftertaste was sweet and crisp breadiness. The finish was dry and sweet. 
On the palate, this one sat pretty light and showed a great sessionability about it. The carbonation was only as sharp as was expected for the style.

2838,"2014-04-11",3.7,"12 ounce bottle. Pale yellow straw appearance, very light and clear, which Ive heard is expected with German pils, as opposed to Czech pils. Theyve used Hallertau noble hops here, another nod to the historical differences between German pilsners and Czech pilsners. Flavorwise, in addition to the malt backbone that plays a big traditional lager role, the Bavaria-sourced Hallertaus impart a grassy, earthy and spicy character thats a very welcomed change, in my opinion, to the run-of-the-mill American macro lagers out there. Its fairly sweet as well, which works well alongside the spice and malt aspects. Very light bodied, low carbonation, overall its an easy one to put back early in the night when your senses are acute.

Looking for lots of yeast and hop notes but I get more hop acids and lightly sweet, simple pale malts. Clean, though.Medium bodied, with light honey and vanilla.

2838,"2014-03-08",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2016 My Bottom Line:
This impressive Pilsener shares silken straw malts and well-defined noble hop character in a lean, polished body.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-An undying head of foam tops the translucent pale blond.
-The prickly bubbles and slender mouthfeel combine for very high drinkability.
-The Saphir dry-hop fits perfectly, adding a touch of freshness to the nose.
-The hop finish develops white pepper allusions too.
-This doesnt have the same malt structure as a typical bottled/pasteurized Czech Svetly. More of a cross with German stylings.
-This was a great surprise. Firestone Walker can do strong ales and delicate lagers just as expertly!
-I dont feel like its a hopped-up version of a Pilsener made for American palates. Actual Czech Svetly and German Pilseners are as hoppy as this one when served fresh and on tap.

2838,"2014-03-05",4.0,"The beer pours a beautiful, pale yellow/gold with a nice head of perfectly sized, egg-shell white bubbles that settle to a quarters finger-width above the glass and demonstrate a nice retention. In body, the beer is nearly as clear as water with no particles and a steady stream of bubbles dancing through it. On the nose, the beer smells of buttery cracker malt with a solid bitter, herbal scent with a touch of mint and fresh grass. On the very edges of the nose stone fruit can be sensed alongside fresh pine needles. On the tongue, the beer tastes superbly bitter upfront with wonderful balancing bready sweetness. Soft acidity from the hops wets the sides of the mouth and provides a very, very light pucker. There is even a soft touch of earthy salinity in the beer. In flavor the beer tastes of bitter grass and herbal hops, mellowing into a smooth butter cracker malt. The finish is blend of smooth white bread and grassy bitters with just a touch of gooseberry, salt, and a mineral-earthy flavor. This is a grassy bitter beer at heart, but it has a wonderful balance of sweet malt and mineral-like flavor. In the mouth, the beer feels on the heavy side of light in body with a creamy carbonation and a definite prickly-crisp mouthfeel that leaves the mouth refreshed and tingling with saliva in the cheek pouches and a slight neutrality throughout the rest of the beer. Overall, this is a superbly hoppy pilsner with awesome subtle complexity. The beer is refreshing and perfect to nearly session.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

2838,"2014-02-08",4.1,"American brewers like to name every lager after some European city. I could not tell you why. They tend to randomly chose Dortmund or Pilsen or some such place and then proceed to brew a beer that in no way resembles the beers traditionally brewed in that city. While I dont really hold this against them, I do often wonder why on earth they do it. This beer in particular is a fantastic American lager in the style typical of our craft brewers (to differentiate between this and the kind of lager that gets advertised during the Super Bowl). It is bright, brilliant and hoppy w/ loads of citrus fruit and just a touch of an herbal quality that might be its lone tribute the style of beer it is supposedly emulating. I hate to make my review of such a good beer a rant but this is becoming a real pet peeve of mine. We have a unique and terrific lager style of our own but we always pretend to brew European styles.

2838,"2013-08-07",2.9,"Pour from a 12 oz bottle produces a golden brew with a thin head that stays around just long enough leave some white lacing around the edge of the glass. The aroma is moderately strong, and dominated by fruit: tart raspberries, with a subordinate lemon note, come to mind. The flavor is juicier than the typical pilsener. The closest flavor comparison that comes to mind is a dry hard cider, the typical bready flavors of a pilsener drowned out by a stronger hop profile. The lingering dry finish one might expect from a Czech pilsener is nowhere to be found, and unfortunately, not much lingers to replace it.

If Firestone Walker aimed to create a beer that falls in the middle of an IPA and a pilsener (and is less remarkable for it), then they succeeded. If you are looking for a beer that retains most of the characteristics of a Czech or German pilsener, you would be better served looking elsewhere.","","bignate"

2838,"2013-04-21",3.8,"Draft on tap at Tribes Alehouse (Mokena, IL). Really excited for this one! Pours a nice rich golden hue, some darkness, faint haze but near transparent. Lively carbonation, frothy white layer of head that sustains, sticks around, and laces well. Summery sunny glow. Aromas are spicy and earthy hops, grass and florals meet a twist of lemon. Bready malts, Pils malt, and some gentle doughy qualities. Crisp, dry, firmly hopped. Nice. Initial is lighter end of the fold, a touch of body keeps it honest. Dry earthy hops meet bready and straw grainy malts. Clean gentle bready sweetness progresses into a more dry and slowly growing earthy and Noble hop dry bitter quality. Gentle spice, gentle citrus compliments. Crisp cool clean malty qualities, earth, spice, dry earthy and grassy hops. Earthy, floral, twist of mellow citrus again compliments. Dry and firmly bitter, though mellow clean and dry backend and finish. Really well constructed. Clean, mellow dry bready malts, straw, firmly hopped and dry throughout.

2838,"2013-04-12",3.5,"Nice little pils from FW. Pours a bright, clear pale gold. No haze. Good head. Lots of fine bubbles. Good lacing. Aroma has grassy hops with some fresh grain notes. Hay, lemons, earth round things out. Taste is mildly bitter but theres a bit of light malt sugariness to it. The malt flavor is a touch grainy but not bad. A little too much sweetness. Finish is fairly clean. Mouthfeel could be lightened further but its pretty good. Id just prefer pils to be ultra crisp.

Starts with a hoppy, grassy and light citrus hoppiness.  Middle has mild malty biscuit character.  Finishes snappy, crisp, and quite hoppy with a good amount of hops.

[ Bottle ][ Costco Carlsbad ][ 12oz x 5 ][ ~$1.50 ea ][ Globe + Pils Flute ][ 5/9/14 ]
>> Whoa baby has this beer improved. I was skeptical that anyone on the West Coast, or simply just not in Pennsylvania, could ever make an American pilsner like Victory. Then along came Heater Allen, but there beers are impossible to find so big whoop. So I had high hopes for Pivo. First taste was a bust. Now that it is a regular offering from FW, someone has done some major recipe overhaul and made this into a baller level pilsner.The pour is crystal clear golden straw. Soapy, large white foam with good lacing. Nose is super sharp and fresh lemongrass, white grapefruit peel, ultra fresh lemon zest, fresh lawn trimmings. Taste is oh man, so crisp and crackery, ridiculously addictive grassy hop bomb bitterness. Palate is long and quenching, grassy long finish is addictive. Can kill 4 of these bottles in one sitting with no problem. Perfect crushability. This is about to become a staple in my household. Thank you 3fourths for inspiring me to retry this one. 8/4/8/5/16=4.1
Original Rating: Tap at Churchkey. Clear yellow pour. Weaker head to none. Nose is mild butterscotch, pear, sweet esters. Odd. Taste is sudsy, soapy, a tad chemical. Not so great. 6/3/5/3/11=2.8 3/25/13","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

2838,"2012-12-31",3.8,"Sampled at 1702 Tucson; December 2012
Arrives from the tap with a frothy, one finger thick, pale head that leaves lots of layered lacing on the sides of my glass as I quickly quaff this beer. The beer is a bright gold color that shows a pale gold, brilliantly clear hue when held up to the light. The aroma has a pale cracker like grain character to it up front followed by a floral, slightly citrus like, and lightly herbal hop character that picks up steam the more I dig into the nose.

Dry, crisp, and clean up front, an herbal, slightly woody hop character kicks in towards the middle and finishes with a solid bitter hop bite. The bitterness is clean and biting from the get go, with the beer being pretty dry the hop focus is on the bitterness and herbal character, but there is a touch of lemon like citrus character here. The beer is quite light bodied and refreshing without being overly thin; it is incredibly quaffable and almost seems to disappear from my glass without me even trying.

This is a really nice Pilsner, I could easily consume a whole lot of this over a lazy, warm day.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
