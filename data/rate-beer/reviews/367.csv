367,"2017-01-20",3.7,"From notes. Enjoyed at a bottle share at Seans on December 29. 375 mL bottle. The pour is a nice cloudy golden yellow with a thicker white head that slowly dissipates, leaving no lace. The aroma is really funky up front. There is a light tart fruitiness, a strong dusty barnyard to it, and a little horse blanket on the finish. Its interesting, and not quite what I would call a gueuze. Its close, but not quite. The flavor is much of the same. There is a woodiness to it in addition to the funk. The barnyard kicks up a little more and drowns out the tart fruitiness. The horse blanket exists on the finish with a little sweatiness. The mouth feel is lighter and pretty crisp with a lingeringly funky and lightly spicy finish. Its really dry and not as tart as I would hope. Interesting beer.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Pretty classic but less pronounced than a small bunch of Belgium Geuze thats present at the table. Flavor is also a bit milder than the Belgium samples, but very refined and smooth. Its the real deal, but still a rather different experience. Mild acidity, smooth fruit, wood, mild funk, balanced acidity.

367,"2015-11-25",3.8,"375 mL bottled April 3rd, 2014, drunk 11/19/15, thanks to my friends John and Sara.Encouraging pour shows a brassy-golden liquid. Good clarity and well-carbonated with a white head atop that slowly fades to cover/ring. Not tons of sediment left behind in the bottle, which is a bit surprising given it being kept in the fridge for a year, but whatever.Soft, understated funk in the nose immediately makes good on its promise of emulating true lambics. Light wood/oak character is a little bit more perceptible here than in most of the real guys, but its not in any big quantity here and is certainly still enjoyable. B. Lambicus like cherry pie and deep, complex, sweaty, horsey funk. Some light black and white pepper phenols and no alcohol or flaw.Excellent and subtle in the mouth. Its neither heavily sour, yet nor does it come across as cheap or rushed. Soft oak, cheese, yogurt and lots of cherry and horse blanket. Tight carbonation. Passes most of the ""Is this an excellent, authentic lambic?"" tests, but Im a bit concerned with a somewhat moderate amount of what tastes either like adjunct sugar fermentation or oxidation. Seems hard to believe it would be either but nonetheless, there is something very slightly off-putting. Bitter vanilla-meets-cork-meets-candi sugar is about the best I can do to describe it. Whatever the case, the beer is still excellent and a truly impressive feat by Allagash. Really hope to try the other Coolships eventually.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

367,"2012-10-18",4.6,"Bottle @ home for #5,000! Special thanks to a buddy in Portland, Maine that hooked me up with an all-time favorite. Ive had it on two occasions at GABF, but figured I would do a nice re-review for #5,000. 375mL bottle opens with a mild hiss. Pours a moderately cloudy, yellow orange appearance with a moderate cream colored head. Fairly lactic, tangy, a bit spicy funky, a bit cheesy, mild citrusy aroma. Not as much funk or cheese in the nose that I got during my trips at GABF. More tart than my previous. Just a ton of funk, somewhat spicy, barnyard/hay, woody/herbal. moderate cheese, tangy, fairly oaky flavor with an ultra-funky, moderately sour, lemon, a touch chewy finish. Fantastic, fantastic stuff. It really has a beautiful, rich flavor that Ive tried in very few American sours. FUCK YEAH. (4.6)

GABF 2012. They brought this baby back again?! It was my second favorite last year at the fest and this year it took gold in my book. Huge cheesy funk and barnyard elements along with a very satisfying and refreshing sourness but not overdone by any means on the sourness. So much funky, lacto, stinky character makes this baby one of my all-time new favorites. FUCK YEAH. (4.7)

GABF 2011. Moderate cloudy, light yellow appearance with a white head. Barnyard, moderately tart, light cheesy, lemon citrusy aroma. Tangy, lemon citrusy, cheese, funky, barnyard flavor. Yeah! (4.3)","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
367,"2012-10-17",4.3,"Multiple pours at GABF 12. Hazy yellow in appearance with a small white head. Funk, cheese, urine, dust, citric acid, and wood in the aroma. Taste is sour fruits, highly refreshing, yet balanced beautifully with funk and wood; big citrus juice, lemon zest, urine, and wax. Light and crisp body with high carbonation. Seriously well-built beer and by far the best example of an American made gueuze I have ever come across. Awesome!","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
367,"2012-10-14",4.2,"Sampled on 10/12/2012 at GABF. This gueuze pours a slightly hazy light yellow gold color from the tap. Small to medium sized white foamy head. The aroma is fruity, sweet, funky and tart. A medium bodied gueuze. The malts are fruity and sweet, tart and funky. The hops are herbal. Decent mild carbonation. Lots of tartness and some funk throughout this beer. Nice balance. Lightly acidic. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly tart.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

367,"2012-09-23",3.4,"Opened during Sunday Night Football with readbaron and bauermj. This is the 7/27/11 batch. Had the first batch and heard this was better, so Im eager to see how this one is. Pours a cloudy yellow with a fingers worth, head is slightly soapy in appearance. Nose is comprised of pepper and lemon, with the black pepper being the predominate theme. Flavor is similar to the nose with the pepper being more subdued. It gets more balanced as it warms. Light mouthfeel, gentle carbonation, light tartness, and a moderate finish. I like this less than the first batch, the pepper character is too much to overcome. Hopefully future batches are better.","Illinois, USA","Dunt"
367,"2012-09-10",3.8,"375ml bottle. Courtesy of the nightrider. Thanks Tom... Pours a somewhat hazy apricot orange hue and topped with a quickly reducing white head that results in a ring around the glass... Aroma is geueze like with a barnyardy funk. Somewhat sharp and cheesy but has a genuine lambic-like quality to it... Flavors continue in a similar path with lambic qualities consisting of a mild degree of barnyard funkiness upfront with a decent amount of sourness that shortens up with a semi-sweetness that shortly curtails into a dry effervescent finish. Body is shy of medium with fairly lively carbonation. Could honestly be mistaken for a Belgian lambic, although doesnt live up to the better standards of the style. Still fairly solid especially for an American sour.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
367,"2012-09-02",4.2,"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a touch of foam and some side and bottom rising bubbles.  Aromas are sour fruit, young nectarine, berry, dusty, wood and funk.

Flavor is equally pleasant with just a hair less complexity.  Funk and lemon shifts toward the forefront.  Medium to light bodied.  Healthy dose of lactic tartness.
