3761,"2012-08-29",4.0,"In short: A cranked-up blond wheat ale that is as refreshing as it is nourishing.  Excellent
How: Tap at Tap-NY 2012, multiple samples
The look: Partially cloudy dark yellow body topped by a long-lasting small white head
In long: Nose of fresh banana bread with notes of lemongrass.  Inviting nose.  Taste is a avalanche of crisp wheat, a big thick body that somehow doesnt feel heavy at all, thats the nature of cranked-up wheat body done right.  Tasty banana bread, some lemongrass and a hefty amount of sundried grass leaving a dry finish with a bit of acidity on the tongue.  As refreshing as it is nourishing.

Poured a vibrant predominantly yellow color that leans on orange a bit; nice fluffy finger of white foam (would have hoped for more in the style, but it was a result of the tending, not the beer). Bananas are dominant; light citric aromas; hint of clove; some yeastiness and sweetness; really good stuff here in the aroma.

Some sweet banana is there as well and only a touch of clove as it warms. A bit slick in texture- not as lively in carbonation as other examples of this style. Flavor has a sweet & tart character. A lemony wheat malt tartness meshes with some vanilla and ripe banana sweetness with less spicy phenols than I expected. A bit less refreshing than I would like for the style, but still decent.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

3761,"2008-12-27",3.5,"Tap at Waterfront Ale House - a nicely balanced hefe, but the higher than usual sweetness gives away its strength, and makes it a little less refreshing than it should be - however, with just the right amount of phenolics, tangy wheat character, and notes of orange marmalade, it is pretty darn tasty - it scores points for not being over the top with banana and clove (something that a lot of american-made hefes do), too - overall a nice take on the style, but just a tad sweet.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

3761,"2007-06-13",3.4,"On tap at the brewery, it poured with a nice head, but my take home growler didnt fare as well.  In both cases the color was golden amber and produced minimal lacing with a powerful aroma of bananas, cloves, and and vanilla.  Flavor was along the same lines of the traditional Blonde, just more magnified.  Alcohol is very well hidden and seems to smooth out the overall flavor, yet thickens the mouthfeel is a tad too much for a summer offering.
