2560,"2016-06-08",4.3,"750mL bottled 6/12/15, drunk 6/3/16, thanks to Nelson.Burnished copper with a strong rusty-iron hue. Good clarity and an off-white head atop that is large and slowly recedes to cover.Light souring agents in the nose mix with very strong minerals, plenty of hay, and fresh wheat-like cereal notes. As usual, the house character is charming and with warming, a moderate fruitiness emerges, full of cherry, apple and strawberry, that lightens the otherwise somewhat austere wheat and bacteria/brett characteristics (austere but still enjoyable and highly aromatic). A lot going on here for only 4% but not messy/overdone in the least.Soft, nearly slick at times, texture shows very well-attenuated malts, light wheat and fine carbonation. Tart, I wouldnt say sour, with strawberry and light cherry skin-like fruitiness adding vibrancy. Light honey, baguette and vanilla notes add complexity, from the malt/wheat and it ends with just a bit of peppery phenol. No alcohol, of course, and no flaw. Maybe just a bit too much tartness and strong fruitiness with the specialty malt characteristics not providing enough softness. Maybe not the best version to age, as more base malt sweetness and less bacterial/brett character might actually be preferable here. Still one of the better grisettes Ive had, and fun to try it with a year of age.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The beer is hazy yellow with a white head that leaves some good lacing on the snifter. Really nice aroma. Nice floral presence, yeast, light hops.

Appearance : Clear yellow with huge foamy white head. Short head retention. Some lacing,

Aroma : Great malt with rustic yeast. Nice wheat with floral hops. Nicely rustic and countryside. Very fresh and nicely floral. Light fruity notes too. Great citrusy notes.

Palate : Carbonation is a bit intense at first but it settles down with time. Rather fizzy.

Taste : Very dry and sharp with chewy malts, sharp floral and herbal hops. Finish is very herbal with light citrusy notes and some hay.

Overall : Very light and drinkable. Would be a bit more drinkable if carbonation was a bit softer. Finish is very dry and sharp. Nose is awesome with great rustic notes. Taste also has some nice yeasty notes, Finish is slightly astringent probably because there is not much residual sugars. Lots of character for such a low abv beer. Very good as usual.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

The nose is absolutely wondrous, with notes of wheat, lemon, tangerine, parsley and thyme, and beautiful bready dough. The prevalance of the grain and dough still masterfully mixes with those vibrant herbal and citric qualities. The flavor is marvelously refreshing, and the crisp effervescence reminds me of a combination between Orval and a kristalweizen. A touch of earthy funk mixes with the aforementioned green pungency, along with hints of mango and white grapefruit. The palate is delightfully bubbly and crisp, but also yields a nice dryness from the bread components near the finish. So much going on for such a light beer. Expertly done, and delicious.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

The look: Cloudy yellow blonde body topped by a large white head with good retention
In long: Nose is countryside field rustic, some wild flowers and freshly cut hay.  Taste has a lot of fresh hay in a fluffy body, plain wheat crackers, lemongrass, dried light color fruits, flowers, rustic yeast.  Finish is rather dry and tart with a mild citrusy bitterness.  As easy to drink as youd expect for a 4% beer yet there is a lot of things going on here and the beer feels quite original, almost unusual.  Lively light body.

Nose brings forward some nice aromas of white pepper with a little bit of black in there. Notes of earth as well as straw come through. Mild wheaty character. Great lemon rind comes through as well, quickly becoming the most-dominant portion of the brew. Flavor is similarly intense, yet mellow at the same time. Subtle fruit notes plus a nice bit of pepper and yeast throughout. Lemon rind abounds.

2560,"2011-08-22",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2012 My Bottom Line :  
Oranges, wheat and herbal hops ride this Grisettes fluffy effervescence, as citrusy tartness, a milky touch and spicy hop bitterness seal each gulp. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A sheet of foam tops the murky yellow beige. Foam recedes quickly to a ring.
-This is obviously very drinkable, yet it delivers lots of complexity. Impressive.
-The finishing hop bitterness is quite lengthy (when fresh). This endurance is not really necessary, but I wont complain.
-Dryness makes it all the more enjoyable in the long run.
-The milky angles are almost lactic.
