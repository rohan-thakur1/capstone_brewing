3186,"2012-01-24",2.0,"Bottle, 75cl. A clear one, flat and quite oily. Slighlty alcoholic on the nose, with cooked rice and somethng earthy. That goes for the flavor too, to me its too rough. Cooked rice, earth, mold and a little citrusy touch. Lightly oily, warming and sort of smooth on the palate, with a warming finish. Not bad in any way, just too plain, rough and boring. 120124","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

3186,"2007-11-04",1.8,"Bottle- served hot.  When poured, noticed heavy alcohol aroma, underlying aromas were knocked out because of it.  No oil noticed when poured.  Hits the mouth kind of dry- my mouth wanted water after a few sips, not from it being hot, but from a drying effect.  Was drinkable when warm and hot, but not as it cooled down.  Let down.","Austin, Texas, USA","mmmbeer"
3186,"2007-01-20",2.0,"Bottle. Clear colour. Aroma of strong sweet alcoholic fruit. Flavour is bitter, metalicish and strong in alcohol ending with strange dry finish.

3186,"2006-08-24",2.0,"New Leaf Market, Tallahassee, Fl. - 750 ml bottle - served chilled. Pours almost clear with a slight glint. Aroma is sulphur-like with hints of overripe fruit - slightly unpleasant. Flavor is sweet and verging on cloying. Some burnt rice, alcohol and sweet kids cereal make their presence known. Mouthfeel,while somewhat thick, is kind of oily and overall it is difficult to swallow. Not one of the better sakes I have had. My bottle says it is from Australia.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
3186,"2006-03-16",0.9,"it might just be me, but this has a rotten aroma. Clear-coloured body. The start is sweet like rotten fruit, then it clears up - just to disappear. Luckily. It leaves a long disgusting aftertaste, though, with metallic notes and something like bitter hints. Glad I tried it - now I can go around it in the future.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","MartinKubert"

3186,"2006-01-08",2.1,"First of all thank to Buck Dich for helping me sort out the style of this sake I picked up in my local supermarket, and secondly for entering it.It is a very light yellow sake, with a nose, that is very sharp alcoholic combined with rice. A very simple aroma, and not very inviting. The flavor is much milder and more pleasant, with notes of rice combined with light floral notes. This is to date the worst sake Ive rated - and is like the sakes I remember from my younger days, when tried them - and that doesnt invite You to explore the realm of sake - too bad that this is exported.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
