On top of the beer, a normal layer of rather rough white foam is formed. The foam collapses quickly, to leave a rather thick drape. The smell is lovely. It is rich in hops. There is a lovely fruity aroma, reminding me of citrus fruits, lemon and orange zest and some lemon grass. The smell is very fruity and has something summery in it. Besides the fresh hops, I also smell some malty sweet touches. The taste is nice. There is a lovely hoppy bitterness and slightly sourness. There is also a mild sweet malty touch. There is a lovely rich sensation sensation in the mouth. The different flavors, that combine perfectly and are in great balance, and the lovely palate, which contains some strong bubbles and a nice tingly touch. Lovely.

Aroma:

Medium aroma of malts, caramel, tropical fruit, pine, hops citrus and grapefruit.

Appearance:

Hazy/turbid dark orange/brown beer with heavy yeast and with a slight/medium off-white head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts, caramel, tropical fruit and pine; ends slightly bitter and dry with citrus and grapefruit.

Overall:

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. A lot of hops for a amber ale, but I surely do not mind this. When I drank this before, it was brewed at Kees and they did not filter it. The appearance was opaque golden/amber and there was more caramel aroma and flavour.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"
