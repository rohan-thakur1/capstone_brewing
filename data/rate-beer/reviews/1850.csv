1850,"2015-12-08",3.2,"My Bottom Line:
Honeyed cereals dominate the palate until a portentous green bitterness ruins this Heller Bock-like brews refinement.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam tops the clear blond.
-This is absurdly drinkable for 8%. If you are in the mood for bitterness, of course.
-The hop bitterness quickly becomes like a green peppercorn concentrate on the tongue.
-Malts become biscuity and a bit limp with time.
-Light DMS is detected.

The aromas are the weak part of this beer as they are of the cat pee, old school macro beer variety. Maybe a hint of lemon lurking in the background.
Mouth feel is light to medium but closer to the former. Then this beer explodes on the tongue. It feels heavily hopped (especially for a Beaus beer) and has citrus, mango, and a nice dryness going on.

À laveugle, jaurais sans aucun doute opté pour un bon barleywine américain. En bouche, il faut demblée dire quon est loin dune kolsch typique, à commencer par le taux dalcool. Contrairement au nez, le malt est plus présent. Les saveurs de grains amers se démarquent, soutenue par le houblon qui apporte une belle touche fruitée. Le côté bock nest pas en reste. On décèle, comme les arômes le laisse présager, un goût plus sucré de miel et sucre dorge. Le grain malté revient en finale pour laisser sur le palais une sensation dâcreté mielleuse et herbacée que je trouve à mon goût un peu déplaisante.

1850,"2015-09-24",3.9,"Haters gonna hate indeed. Not sure why this stuff isn't getting more love. For starters, I don't think it's seriously trying to pass itself off as a kolsch. Lug Tread is a ""tribute"" to Kolsch, and this stuff is frozen LT with a bunch of new world hops. The label calls it ""Kolsch Bock"" which isn't a thing. So slamming it for being classed in the wrong style seems strange to me. Anyway....I get lots of sweet soft tropical fruit (mango, papaya, passion fruit) and some of what Freaky_Tiki referred to as ""cat pee juju"" (I believe). Cereal and honey as it warms. Taste is a sweet, syrupy pale malt with a nice balancing dose of fruity hop flavour and bitterness, and some nice spice. Alcohol is barely noticeable. I guess this stuff is closer to a DIPA than anything else but I don't care what it's called, it's delicious.

I think its fantastic & am already plotting my next purchase of this seasonal 4 pack based on this one beer (to be honest, Im nervous of the pumpkin Weiss but maybe itll outflank my expectations & pleasantly surprise me). Highly recommended for hopheads & other enthusiasts.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Freaky_tiki"

1850,"2015-03-23",3.2,"Idk about this its odd. Sweet pilsener tasting citrusy hops and oily. Really bitter for a kolsch and really strong for a kolsch. This is like making a 12% rum barrel aged porter and calling it a berliner cause you used some wheat.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
1850,"2014-12-26",3.5,"[6781-20140917] Tap. Cereal yeast and fruity grains aroma. Slightly hazy, pale orange body with a medium-lasting foamy off-white head. Sweet yeasty bread grains and cereal hops flavour. Medium body has a tiny hoppy kick. Good. (8/3/7/3/14) 3.5

1850,"2014-11-05",2.8,"On tap at Beau Octoberfest 2014. Pale copper with a beige head. This one was a little odd for me - lots of pilsner characteristics with yeast and more fruit added, slightly cloying, some nelson hops, mild carbonation and light body with alcohol and a cloying sweetness.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"
1850,"2014-10-09",3.5,"[Draught at The Golden Tap Awards, beerbistro] Pours a cloudy gold with a small lasting frothy white head. Aroma is hoppy first followed by tropical fruit and Pilsner characteristics. Flavour is sweet, hoppy and fruity along with a decent bitter finish. Medium bodied. Pretty good.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","blankboy"
1850,"2014-10-02",2.9,"Pale golden pour. The nose is softly spicy and a little bit sweet. Theres a touch of yeast and some okay fruitiness. Meh.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1850,"2014-09-30",3.8,"2014-09-17. Hazy dark yellow body modest off white head. 3+ Aroma is lovely, with tons of fruity hops, tropical fruit and lychee character that is reminiscent of a late harvest wine. 9+ Flavour is similar, lightly cereally pale malt core with an over layer of fruity hops as in the aroma, ever so slightly tart lemon and lychee notes. Very smooth average bodied palate, modest carbonation. The flavour is just good, but the aroma was superb. Clearly this is what Lug Tread wants to be when it grows up. :) On tap at the Golden Tap Awards, Beer Bistro, Toronto","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
