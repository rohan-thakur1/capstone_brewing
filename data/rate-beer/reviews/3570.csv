3570,"2017-04-15",3.6,"Strong aroma of spices, a bit of kefir, black pepper and a bit of fruits (prune?). Taste is acidic with little to no sweetness or bitterness. Spices play major part which on one hand is interesting but gets annoying after a while. Good beer overall, but not as session as gose should be in my opinion.","Poznan, POLAND","pkomar"
3570,"2017-04-14",4.0,"Kolejny bardzo dobry sour ale od Deer Bear. Bardzo intensywnie owocowy, śliwkowo-malinowo-truskawkowy, z delikatną nutą piernika (?). Wytrawne, z solidnym, kremowym, mega przyjemnym ciałem. Wyraziście kwaśne, owocowo ściągające na finiszu. Świetne piwo, mam nadzieję że seria będzie kontynuowana :)","Warsaw, POLAND","Korcz"
3570,"2017-04-13",4.0,"Tasting glass draft @ Drugie Dno. With plum. Very hazy to murky orange fruits appearance, off-white head. Nose is massive fruit, fruit compote feel, strawberry, plum, raspberry, felt like far more different fruits than just plum. Taste is basically more fruit compote than beer, thick stone fruit, plum, strawberry, faitnly sour, fruit tea, huge fruit tea,.. Soft carbonation, thick fruit tea & compote body. Reminds me more of fruit tea & compote than beer but tis very fruity, tasty, quite pleasant, a nice one.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
