3115,"2015-10-25",4.1,"This was never supposed to be an official ""milestone"" rate, but its languored in my backlog while I tried to find the right way to rate it. But I cant live in the past forever, and Id hate for it to be forgotten. So now, after a poker night, drinking the remnants of a Cycle pallet 4 that was shared by another generous RBian (you guys are the best), its time to finally do this.   So a few months back I meet up with beastiefan2k to play basketball. I dont remember the game, but he probably owned me the way he does (its a crime for a dude who is so much shorter than me to beat me so bad, but he does and I guess I have to deal with it). Afterward, he says hell buy me a beer to celebrate the birth of my second child -- after he already gifted us a nice bottle of champagne. So we head to Toronado -- Eugene thinks ahead and changes clothes to be all respectable, because hes a respectable guy, but I look more-or-less homeless, with an unkempt beard and sweat pooling atop my beer belly. And Im all like, ""Ill have the kolsch."" But Eugene says, ""what? No, this is a celebration. Let me get you a nice beer."" And then Eugene, Mr. Can-You-Believe-How-Much-They-Want-For-That-Beer, without batting an eye, orders us a $65 bottle of Cable Car. Not only that, he has us text OldMrCrow to join in. Not only that, but he offers to share the bottle with the staff. After they decline, a random friend of mine shows up at the bar, and Eugene is all like ""hey, do you want some Cable Car?"" And he says, ""huh, what is that, is it a stout or something?"" And Eugene just smiles and says, ""no, its a sour."" No more, no less, and friend takes the glass, shares it with his girlfriend, they both say, ""huh, thats pretty good for a sour. Thanks."" And thats how Eugene rolls -- making it rain Cable Car for all the people in the house, like it aint no thing. like its just beer or something.So heres the thing. I can rate this beer because I took notes (to follow). But I dont really remember the beer at all. What I remember is hanging out with Eugene and Crow, drinking this beer at Toronado, and thinking, ""Goddamn, Eugene is a cool dude. I could learn a lot from this guy."" So yeah, cheers to Eugene, a cool dude we should all drink with more often. Anyway, the beer, because I guess this is still a rating about a beer. Pours gold, somewhere between hazy and clear, with thin layer of irregularly clingy bubbles. Aroma/taste bring, in no particular order: Oak. Vinegar. Funk. Sweetness, but no Cheerios (of which I whole-heartedly approve). Fruit (think something in the peach family). Vinous. Assertively tart, but not aggressive -- Carl nails it with the ""approachable"" deScriptor. Overall: this is quite the treat.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

Another beer I thought I might never try, but then Toronado Seattle came in, they have it in bottles, and it was just a matter of time. (My understanding is that it will pretty much cost you a left nut in trade to get it anywhere other than the two Toronados). Well, the time came. Beastie bought this one to celebrate the birth of Prufrocks daughter. (Congratulations). They ever so generously texted me and asked me to join them, which I quickly promised to do in exchange for taste, which turned out to be a whole glass. Thanks, gentleman. 
Beautiful yellow pour, modest head. Rich sour nose, not funky, just sour in a delicious way. The flavor is extremely accessible. None of the latrine or any of that business, just an enjoyable tartness that is far from the acidic overkill of many early American sours. I see how this one exploded to the top of the Ratebeer rankings! The sour is complemented by a lovely undercurrent of sweetness that rewards each sip through the late palate. Wow -- this is just so approachable. I dont know that I could pick a better sour with which to introduce a friend to the style. Great stuff.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

The oak exists a little on the back end. The mouth feel is prefect. Thin, but not watery, carbonated, but not champagne-y. The aftertaste is lingeringly sour and fruity. Such a damn good beer.

3115,"2014-12-17",5.0,"HUGE thanks to bytemesis for sending me this bottle. Thanks Mike! This 2013 vintage bottle was shared with my new fiancé after I proposed to her, only minutes prior, while we were out on a walk through our woods!

I had it all planned out: She was dropping her brother off at the train station and I was chilling this beer, getting the ring positioned in my pocket...and of course, calling her father and asking his blessing. (Which he gave me!)

After she returned home, I suggested that we take a walk with our dog around the property. We often take walks, so this wasnt anything out of the ordinary. Even as I began to discuss the ideas I had for our wedding, she didnt suspect a thing. We have had this discussion many times as well. By the time we made it through our ravine to the spot where we want to have the ceremony. I dropped to my knee and presented THE RING and popped THE BIG QUESTION........she said yes, of course!! 

After some private moments **think Princess Bride mega-kiss**, we returned inside to have a toast! 

This beer was perfect in every way for the occasion. It felt good to pop the cork in celebration! Aromas of Brett-tinged oak gave a nice and dry funk followed by light lemon peel, green apple, brie, hay and a slight hint of blue cheese. As I let the aromas waft out of the bottle and I poured this beauty into 2 New Glarus glasses for sharing, the memories of our 4.5 year relationship came flooding back. This reminded me of how I turned Kacye on to Sour/Wild Ales.....literally creating a sour-freak....and a conundrum of not being able to open them without her there! It made me smile....looking into her eyes....it was hard to hold back the tears of joy! 

A gorgeous golden ale, slightly hazy yet vibrant..... a white-as-snow head that gently pillowed up the glass before settling into a nice ring around the glass with some spotty lacing. A medium carbonation gives this beer life. Dances nicely.

The taste was incredibly fulfilling. Balanced. Solid. Steady. Relentless. The tart pucker was coupled nicely with a dry, oaky funk. Beautiful. Notes of under-ripe fruits....green apple, lemon, white grape....it pushed a nice light undertone across the palate, elating the senses. So elegant. Notes of brie and hay lend to a quick malted sweetness that melds into another dose of deep funk. Notes of cheese and barnyard. Love it. The finish pushes with the medium carbonation, nice and lively...never fizzy. Dry vinous notes, couple with the oak, funk and additional sour note that culminates this beauty of a beer. 

Such a magical day, such a magical beer.....I dont think I have ever felt Cloud 9 until now. I am looking forward to sharing many more beers with Kacye.....I am just not sure how we can top this one!! 

And so, the challenge begins......","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"

I was not expecting to get to try this despite visiting Toronado as it can be hard to get. When the wait staff asked me as I was closing the tab if I wanted a bottle it took exactly three seconds to say Yes. I am glad too - this is a world class sour that put even the Almanac Bourbon Barrel Peche to shame.

Aroma / Appearance - A golden body shimmers with life and light peachy edges. Lemons, oak, and a lingering tartness give this an edge a bit stronger than the average sour but without being vinegary. it almost could be mistaken for a gueuze.

Flavor / Palate - Oak and lemon lightly play across the tongue. The tartness grows until crashing into sour waves on the back of the throat. Almost like a dry champagne it sparkles the entire time. This is one of those beers that everyone should get a chance to try and proves that Lost Abbey is still on top of their game.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3115,"2014-03-23",4.4,"2010 bottle generously shared by AdamJackson on 3/15/14Walked in to the tasting and this bottle was already open, waiting patiently for me and definitely beckoning. Hows that for the first beer of the tasting? Save the best for first! And as far as I was concerned, this was the best of show (though I got too drunk and had to leave before Duck Duck was opened, so who knows).Anyhow, the aroma was a pretty quickly decided 10, for me. I started with not even an inch of glorious, clear, ruby liquid but even that yielded a bountiful, rich, very strong aroma of perfectly wedded sour acids. Acetic acid was gentle at this point and only added enough vinegar-like notes to punctuate the style while the malo-lactic portion was soft, rich and divine. Smelled like it had cherries jumping out of the glass. Tons of black pepper, cherry pit and very light vanilla. Bone dry tartness lingering. Wow, if this stuff smells this much like cherry, I wonder what the actual Kriek version is like...Beautifully flavorful, as well, with a very dry, light body, leaving only traces of candied prunes and light caramel while the lactic acid and black pepper phenols do all the work. Hints of light base malt sweetness provides excellent balance and the beer seems neither overly/obnoxiously sour, nor lacking in any sour character.

Light oak character in the back. Taste was similar to the smell. Lots of lemon zest with a strong vinegar sourness to it. The malt character really was noticeable in the back. This really reminded me of a gueuze. Lots of carbonation with a light body. Slight dryness. Now that I have had this fresh, I prefer this aged.

T - The beer starts off with a great mix of sour and tart white grapeish flavor. It is quite strong but not too overpowering.

S - Quite a bit of funky brett, lemon, and other bright citric fruits blend well with the strong funk. Pretty tart but not to the point of being overpowering. Very nice stuff.
T - Lots of sourness up front giving way slowly to a mix of strong acidic lemon and some chewy brett funk. Finish is dry with plenty of lingering sour funk. Nice and light, quite refreshing actually. It did wear me down over the course of the bottle but I think that had more to do with me drinking the entire thing myself. I would love to get my hands on a bottle of this for the cellar.

over all a great beer. This vintage is certainly young and needs some more time to develop and creat the tart sour flavors that are missing!","California, USA","pastradul"
3115,"2011-06-28",3.5,"Bottle at Toronado, SF. 2010 vintage. Poured into a tulip.

3.5 A: First pour was a surprisingly clear darker yellow color. Two and a half fingers of light, frothy white head. Retention isnt too impressive and only some spotty lacing.

4.0 S: Good mix of fruity sweet and sour. Lots of tangy lactic acid with maybe a touch of acetic acid. A lot of oak and a good bit of vanilla, but only slightly tannic. Quite fruity like sweet tarts. Ive heard this used for DDG, but it seems to be appropriate here as well. Wild apple, lemon, generic berry, and perhaps some peach. 

4.0 T: Like the nose - a good mix of fruity and sour. Again the lactic acid is dominant with just barely any hints of acetic, though overall this is far from mouth puckering. Lemon, peach, sour green apple, and lemongrass. Again a good bit of oak and vanilla with a low tannic astringency.

4.0 M: Lighter medium body. Despite LAs reputation, this is fully carbonated and perhaps a bit too much so. Good creaminess and certainly smooth.

4.0 D: Good beer, but it isnt as impressive (at least not this vintage) as the reputation suggests. However, if nothing else, it is well balanced and highly drinkable. Good value for $20, barely acceptable for $30, but $40 is far too much after the novelty is achieved.

The fresh stuff had a lot of sulfur, while the older bottles had relatively strong barnyard notes, at least for an American sour.  The beer was medium sour and very dry.  Older vintages were stronger on the sour, but it never got too puckery.  Its surprisingly restrained, almost too restrained.  A mix of vinous and dry cidery notes with hints of lemons are the fruitiest notes that Im getting.  Theres some nice oak and musty yeast flavors in there.  The brett, oak and fruit notes go together very well and the beer is easy to drink, but it seemed a bit light on complexity.

A: Like golden-orange body. Thin white bubbly head. Quickly receded and left traces of lacing behind on the glass.

S: Delicate, like fruits including peaches, apricots, lemons, and green apples. Lightly sour in the nose with a nice subtle funkyness.

T: Bam. This was good. When it comes to sours I am a sucker for the lighter citric wilds (brute, temtpation, sactification, fou foune). This one is bangin. Lots of soft peaches and apricots. An acidic lemon twist and a nice sour green apple. Some subtle tart grape skins rounds out this treat.

M: Medium bodied with a gentle rolling carbonation throughout. Sweet, tart, sour and funky. This definitely a challenging workout for the tastebuds. In the end its got a nice dry refreshing quality that leaves you thoroughly satiated.

3115,"2010-06-28",4.2,"750ml bottle, 2008 vintage, aged about 1.5 to 2 years.  Pours mostly clear, with perhaps a very slight haze, showing a medium golden hue. A small, fizzy, off-white ring of foam forms at the head, leaving wet, broken arches of lacing on the glass after each tilt.  The aroma is ripe with fruit, very forward with apricot and dried peach notes.  A secondary wave of white grapes brings a tartness that marries decidedly well with a light, ""clean"", lacto-wheaty yeast funk and wisps of lemony acidity.  Overall, the scent is delectable, and it conjures a strong desire to sip.  The flavor offers notes of soured apricot and lemon up front.  Ample citric and lactic acidity gives way to lightly sweet peach at the mid point, all before finishing with a moderately wild, vinous oak finish.  Delicious stuff!  The palate is softly carbonated, very dry, and crisp, though it does sport ample body for a sour of this nature.  Its quite refreshing, overall, yet also substantive.  Very much in the vein of a Cuvee de Castleton, though less grape driven.  Excellent brew.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Mouthfeel: 3.5 Light bodied but a touch undercarbonated.

Drinkability: 4.5 This one is going down like nothing...probably because this bottle is on the decline. The flavors arent vibrant nor is the sourness overpowering.

Really lovely pour, pale orange, moderately cloudy, generous carbonation, and an all around appearance of vitality for lack of a better term. The nose is wonderfully complex, and the taste too. Many of us got different fruits from it, and for me the dominant element was blackberry, of the ripe, tart variety for sure. Granny Smith and citrus in there along with deep, fairly intense funk - hard to believe theres not more age on this considering the complexity of this facet of the beer.

Batch 1 has held up very well but has become more like white wine and is more sour and full of white grapes. It is bright with citrus/lemon acidity, which shares almost no commonalities with the 2009. 6/10/2010 8/4/8/5/15=4.0750mL 2009 ed batch 3  courtesy of ucusty. There were tons of hyped beers at our Carolina sour tasting- many of them did not live up it. But this certainly did. Pours just a beautiful glowing, hazy light orange/yellow with a thin white head that leaves some spotty lace. Aroma is simply incredible: pineapple, coconut rum, papaya, cotton candy (fairly sweet) layered atop geuze notes of leather, funk, tart apples, lemon zest. Taste is sour with lacto and pedo plus a rich array of tropical fruits and a bit of spicy alcohol. Nice sweet and sour mix. Buttery, rich palate. Light to medium bodied. Just whoa. 3/23/2010 9/4/9/5/17=4.4750mL 2010 ed batch 4 at Toronado SD. Pours a fizzy, clear, white wine color with a diminishing, bubbly white head. Moves tyo muddy, glowing orange with the yeast. Aroma is sharp geuze funk, green apple skins, lemon, key lime, moving to some really incredible sweet complexity akin to baba rhum and marzipan. Taste is soft lactic, very easy to drink with a quick, sharp sour beginning moving to long, lactic beauty. It is almost like glorified Berliner weiss it is so soft and not slap your face sour like some geuzes. Maybe a bit too much lemon. No acedic comes forth that I find with the Veritas 007. Great cotton candy character develops at it warms. 10/10/10 9/4/8/5/16=4.2750mL 2010 ed b4 at Toronado SF. The pour is a bright yellow with a medium, white head that leaves incredibly sticky lace. Pretty much a 5/5 for sour beer where the near zero sugar content makes it tough for lace to stick. Aroma of cotton candy, caramel, pink lemonade, sour/acetic impeding funk, fresh grapefruit, lemon, and acetic spice reminiscent of Hanssens Gueuze, funky white wine. Taste is incredibly soft, not truly sour as much fresh and tart. Bretty earth comes into play atop a beer that exhibits a sweet and sour play on the tongue that is hard to describe with sufficiency. Fresh caramel and sweet oranges take center stage rather than lemon or vinegar. What a perennial treat. 2/4/2011 9/5/8/5/16=4.3","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

In long: Nose is fruity and medium funky.  I dont know why but given the reputation of this beer I expected some kind of extra intense mega-sour sipper.  Not at all.  If anything the Cable Car reminds me of a more mellow version of the Cuvée De Castleton batch 1.   Interesting fruit complexity with an array of refreshing tropical fruits flavours well integrated with the not-too-funky funk.  A nice dryness in the finish, medium sourness, low-medium lemony acidity.  I didnt like it as much as most of my favourite and more intense European and American sours yet because of its relatively high drinkability level for the style this is one I could imagine drinking on a regular basis.  An excellent session fruity sour ale if you want.  But given the price and rarity of the beer making this my session sour ale is about as likely as my work cafeteria having panda burgers on the regular menu.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
3115,"2010-01-24",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
A lush tropical fruit jungle endlessly intertwines with calculated funk in this classy, compelling Sour Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the cloudy straw.
-Carbonation was rather low, making this rather juicy.
-This brew does not reinvent the Sour Ale wheel, but it is yet another excellent product from Lost Abbey. I just wont buy it ever again if it stays at this price.
-The long sour finish is very pleasant; for reference, this might not be as intense as Cantillon or Hanssens products, but it is a gripping sourness nonetheless.

Pours a clear golden yellow with a big creamy white head that hangs on for a while and leaves good lacing.

Aroma is fairly funky with some barnyard aromas and wet grass but the most dominant aroma is the light fruity sourness.  Overall, the aroma is what Id call bright  lots of light tartness with less earthy funk.

Taste is exceptional, lemon zest up front with bready malts, some fruit, maybe pears and green apples, light vinegar.  Fairly funky finish but light so with some lemon.  Sublime taste, super complex, more tart than funk.

Light bubbly mouthfeel, very citric and biting.  Crisp and wine-like in the finish.

Pour is a swirling cloudy NEctarine.  Aroma is funk wood, peach fruitiness, vinous, mellow woodiness.  This aged very well.  Apricot fruitiness as well.  Flavor is immediately complex nectar, apricot, sourness that tingles the palate.  This effortlessly moves to wood soaked with funkiness, becoming very vinous a flutter of vinegar.  Finish is woody and tartness that coats the inside of the mouth.  A revelation.","Chester, Vermont, USA","Jblauvs"
3115,"2009-11-25",4.7,"Vintage 2007 sampled with craftycarl21 and jblauvs. Hazy peach pour with nearly no head. Aroma is bursting with light nectary fruits- peach, nectarine, apricot, tangerine, grape, and grapefruit in the most heavenly quantities and orientations. Oaken funk is huge but ever so mellow. A peppery clove note comes through as well complementing the wondrous arrangement of aromas. Flavor is a funky masterpiece of nectar complexity.  Huge tropical fruits swirl together in an amazing torrent of brettanomyces, barnyard, oak tannins, and juicy ripe sugars. Palate is full, slippery and full of tiny effervescent pillowy caressing bubbles. One of my favorites of the style.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"
3115,"2009-11-25",4.3,"Huge thanks to oteyj for grabbing this. 2007 batch. Pours a slightly hazy orange color, with visible carbonation on the edges. Aroma has massive amounts of funk, peach, apricot, light plum, vinous grape, and some wood; very complex, and smells delectable. The barreling has made this beautifully mellow aroma, not too sharp of a Brett note, yet still bold. Flavor is absolutely stunning; the Brett is key, and present throughout, but doesnt overpower any of the epic flavors of this beer. More nectar fruit starts, then builds to a wondrous zenith that is marked with beauteous wood notes. After this peak, the flavor transforms into more notes of wine and grape, with the funk blending throughout, Palate is marked by the funk, but not too aggressive, and slides across the tongue impeccably. The finish seems to provide a summary of all aspects of the complex flavors, and makes the drinker pine for more of this heavenly liquid. Incredible sour ale.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

For all the hype, Id say it holds up, but persoanlly I would drink Temptation over this in a heartbeat.  Pours a golden color with a frothy white head that quickly settles.  Smells of floral hops, funk, oak, yeast, lemon, and tangerine.  Foams at the front of the palate, almost like Sprite, and evolves into a sharp apple acidity that takes hold on the mid, followed by a film of lemon juice that coats your teeth on the finish.

3115,"2009-11-15",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 19, 2010 2009, batch 3, 750ml bottle.
Poured into Duvel tulip.

A - Pours a mirky golden/light copper color. A nice, fluffy, white head quickly follows on a medium-aggressive pour. A nice, frothy, sticky lacing stays behind from the head. Once held into the light, I can see loads and loads of bubbles rise to the top of the glass from the etched ""D"" on the bottom of my glass. Overall, something to look at in awe and appreciate.

S - Once I popped the cork, I could smell the tart/sour notes from a couple of feet away. Once I brought the glass to my nose, it wanted to turn inside out, just as I imagine my lips will want to do in a few minutes. Musty brett, stanky cheese, lemons, barnyard funk, sweet tropical fruit. All of this combines into an awesome-smelling wild...something to sit back and enjoy for a bit before you taste, lots going on here and probably more then I can pick up.

T - Lip-puckering tart that hits you right off the bat and then mellows out into subtle lemon-esk tingle. This is so damn good, words can hardly describe it. Lots of funky barnyard/brett mixed with some semi-sweet fruity notes. Not too tart/sour which gives you a chance to delve in and enjoy some of the other flavors going on. A nice semi-sweet finish that I dont think I can recall in any other sour Ive had. A very complex wild.

M - Light to medium bodied, but it sways more towards medium but not quite ""medium"" (sorry if Im confusing here, hard to explain). Very full, but light at the same time. The carbonation is right-on here, a nice fizzy tickle on the tongue that helps open up the flavors. A dry finish that makes you come back for more.

D - This beer makes you sit back and appreciate it. Its easy to drink fast, but why? Its great to chill out while sipping on this from time to time. I dont want this bottle to end, but Im glad I was able to pop this one open and enjoy. Lost Abbey, you have done it yet again!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Sean9689"

The taste, like the nose, starts with bold tartness building quickly to a full rolling boil of tart daggers. It then seems to even out a tad with faint fruity notes of apples and lemons.

The flavor is heavy on the lemon with cumin, more funk, and some white wine-like notes.  There is substantial sourness here that cuts through the funk and reminds me of Cantillons lambics.

Very funky aroma with some nice barnyard, horseblankety goodness. Lots of crisp golden fruits, apple, pear, grape, etc and a nice dusty earthy oak character. Just the smell of this beer made my mouth water. I literally sniffed my glass for several minutes before even taking a sip.

This beer has a perfect balance of intense puckering tart barnyard funk, horseblanket notes, slightly lactic and acidic but not too much so. Tart and sour intensity up front that settles into some beautiful light crisp golden fruit notes. Hints of apple, pear, grapefruit, light grape followed by more funky brett oaky sourness which lingers into the amazing mouthwatering finish. Very dry yet sweet and crisp with an amazing crisp dry tart puckering finish.

This is an amazing beer that for me truly lived up to the hype. It is just a perfect blend of tart/puckering sourness, crisp delicious fruit notes and a dry sweet yet tart delectable finish. This beer tasted better with each sip and my mouth was literally watering in anticipation of each sip. This is one of the most complex, flavorful sours Ive ever had and I cannot recommend it any higher. I only wish I had more.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Lacks a bit of farmyard funk on the aroma which I want from my sour ales.  Some funk and lemon, but more muted than Belgian lambics.  Very sour finish.  Smooth lemon.  Very drinkable, good funky lemon and good flavour in the mouth.  I suppose a bit unfair to compare an American sour with Belgian lambics, but this doesnt stand up against lambics.  That funk just isnt there.  We had a Girardin black label gueuze earlier in the day and then a J&J Blauw afterwards and the aroma of those 2 just blows virtually all American sours away.

Sour apricots and bright citrus fruit are layered with notes of oaky, buttery chardonnay and green moss.

3115,"2009-10-04",4.3,"Review number 360 on the quest to 365 is a very special number, and one I had been trying to acquire for a while.  This 09 vintage comes from a trader over at BA.  First impression of the aroma is very good.  Funky lemony/citrus notes and some wood.  Not an overly sour or funky smell but a fine balance between the two.  Appearance is also quite good.  The head is only about a half an inch but has quite the staying power.  I poured this one extremely carefully as to keep the yeast in the bottle, so the murky golden liquid looks great.  Flavor is thankfully not subtle.  The leathery brett compliments nicely the sourness here.  Wood, lemon, funk.  Really excellent and nearly worth the hype surrounding it.  Palate is suitably bubbly and medium in thickness.  I know a lot of folks are not big fans of the brewery, but I can say the good to bad ratio, for me anyway, and keeping in mind I have sought out mostly special releases, has been quite excellent.  Probably wont be able to try this one ever again.  Was worth what it took to get.  Excellent beer.","Donora, Pennsylvania, USA","Sonicdescent"

Nose is soft and funky.  Brett and white grape jump out at me.  Soft apricot and peach.  Pretty tart and sour.  Im finding a bit of that signature dry, salty edge that really shines in Veritas 4 and kind of in Duck Duck Gooze.  Kind of similar to Isabelle Proximus too in its biting edge, almost geuze-like at times.  Much more sharp than I expected, and not hugely fruity.  Acidic and just a touch sulfuric.

3115,"2009-08-31",4.3,"A Mes rate. Bottle at home.Firstly I have to say a HUGE thanks to Ken for giving me the chance to try this without trading something crazy for it. Firstly, its not the best looking beer I have seen. Murky dirty orange with a fizzy alka seltzer type head that lasted all of three seconds. Thankfully the rest of it means this is of no consequence what so ever. The aroma is a straight ten. A perfect blend of sweet fruity, elegant funky sourness an a simply spectactular lemony acidity. The flavour flows on in much the same vein but as with many American sours I just feel the lemony acidity takes centre stage giving the amazing lactic sourness underneath no real chance to really sing its song. Its a story I have witnessed before, especially with the CDC. I cant help but feel this has SO much more to give. Either way its an extremely good beer. Utterly superb mouthfeel and the finish is almost beyond description. A glorious hit of sour lemons and fruity lip smacking goodness. Loads of length too. Excellent beer no doubt but if there was less of the lemon it could be truly a world beater. Thanks so much Ken. Instant hero status.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

Very forward, clear sour brett aroma which is focussed, but not overbearingly strong or opulent.  Fruit aromas abount with underripe peach/stonefruit, green strawberries, light apple juice, and soft lemon.  The flavor is dry, very sour, and crisp with a clean barrel fermantation characte.  Delicate barrel-aged aspects are present as well and are harmoniously blended into the very tight flavor profile.  The body posesses incredible balance, amazing structure, and really shows of the supreme blending skills of the brewer.  This well-composed body delivers the flavor profile with precision and poise.

This was one of the highlights of GABF for me; my friends and I camped out at the Lost Abbey station on multiple days just taking refills of Cable Car.  We got it down to a science where wed be first in line when the new bottles were cracked, getting the clearest pours before the sediment became disturbed.  Bretty pineapple-granny smith smell.  The delicate yeasty things are the first impression in both the nose and the mouth, not the acidity, which was at a lower level than expected (this would never be confused with a proper gueuze or La Folie, the acidity being much more restrained).  The fruit flavors provide a soft but fresh base to the foamy yeasty notes floating over the top, and change upon different sips and different samples: sometimes peach, sometimes lemon, sometimes starfruit (perfectly identified by awaisanen).

Anyone that knows me knows that Ive been trying extraordinarily hard to get a bottle of this. And anyone that has ever let it known that theyve had a bottle knows this as well. Ive offered well over $100 worth of very rare beers, many brewery only release and plenty with less than 1000 bottles made.

Ive been drinking beers with Shane(beachbum1975) for the past 8-10months or so. We both trade way more than we should. Weve always unspokenly tried to one up one another. Well that mother fucker one upped me to end all one ups... but that doesnt mean I wont stop trying :)

This bottle was a belated Christmas gift and presented to Chris(Yetiman420), Steve(FtownThrowDown), and Me(and of course Shane), as a blind tasting for my 500th review. That bastard also just traded for a bottle of the beer I was getting him for a belated Christmas gift. What a D-Bag!

I honestly cannot express my thanks and gratitude, Shane. This was my Holy Grail beer and now my Lost Abbey bottle collection is finally complete, and whats a better way to do it than with a Tomme Arthur signed bottle of Cable Car! :D

750ml corked and caged brown bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. Shared with 3 great BAs.

A: Pours a very murky under ripened grapefruit peel color. A decent sized head forms and holds for a minute or so before falling to a few bubbles. Some spotty lacing throughout.

S: Loads of tart fruits. Lemon, orange, grapefruit, apricot, pineapple, cherries. Some astringent acids from the fruits adds to the tart and sour aromas. Funk is minimal but still lightly present with a touch of wet hay and maybe some light cider vinegar notes.

T/M: The tart and sour fruits are spot on to the nose. Lemon, pineapple, orange are more dominant with cherries and apricot or peach playing more in the back. Really a citrus explosion that is odd in that I normally experience this with loads of bitterness, which this obviously doesnt have. Funkiness is still at a minimum but still retains the wet hay and light cidery notes. I dont think itd hurt to have some more funk. Tartness really starts to build toward puckering as it quickly warms. Some rustic woody and leathery notes form the barrels. Nice light to medium light body with perfect carbonation. Great dry finish that isnt too tart or abrasive.

D: Extraordinarily drinkable. I could drink this all day every day. The tartness and sourness doesnt linger too strong or long. Very good. Yet again, many thanks to you, Shane. You really made my day and you better watch your back when its your turn to be given a milestone beer! And a million thanks to the one that traded this to Shane ;)","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","pimpp"

A careful and slow pour yields a honey colored beer with barely a slight haze and little to no head, appearing in the glass as a still lambic typical will, but a small head can easily be swirled up with a few shakes. Intensely wonderful nose of eggy, resinous pinot noir grapes, overripe and souring peach pulp and lactic acid (medium to heavy). Flavor is properly prickly and sour, the acidic is mostly lactic. Begins with some pinot barrel notes, dry and tannic. Pillowy and soft on the palate at the same time as being prickly and sour, not intense, but just enough to satisfy.

Flavor was lots of green apple, tart grapes, lemon, subtle funk at beginning; slight oaky tannins, banana, and a slight alcohol bite as it warmed; slight corn in after taste.  As it got completely to room temp it was like juicy ripe pineapple and got more sweet overall.  It coats the mouth with tingly bubbles and leaves a lasting impression on the palate.

3115,"2008-08-28",3.8,"Batch 2; Sampled August 2008
Funky, cheesy and sour notes are quite noticeable as I pour this brew.  An average pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces an almost two finger thick, pale, white colored head that leaves some lacing on the sides of my glass.  This has a little chill haze and a touch of permanent haze to it; it went into the cooler with only a slight haze.  The beer is a murky, light amber color as it sits on my desk, but it shows an orangish copper hue when held up to the light.  Wow, this is much more funky than I was expecting it to be, more funky than just about any other Lost Abbey brew.  Ample butyric acid aromas of old, dried sweat laden blankets and cured leather are joined by funky-woody mushroom aromas, some definite farmhouse cheese notes (though this is somewhat soft), uriatic cat pee, fresh scraped lemon zest, oxidized peanuts.  This is all anchored by spicy, tannic oak notes that linger in the background of the nose, but are quite noticeable once you get past the funk.  Some fruitiness seems noticeable at times, but at others is drowned out by the funk; when noticed, aromas of ripe pear, white wine vinegar, hints of kumquat pith & zest, .  This has a very complex, very funky aroma that has a significant, but not overwhelming oak character that seems to be a bit more pervasive than I originally thought, but as a supporting role.

The first sip is quite dry tasting, it is not quite as mouth puckeringly sour as I was expecting, based upon the aroma, but still has a nice tartness to it.  My first sip definitely leaves me thinking that this needs to have a harder sourness to it.  The carbonation is at a light-medium level; persistent, prickly and noticeable, but not any where near the effervescence of sparkling Gueuze (which seems to be a rarer and rarer thing now a days, even amongst the classic Gueuze producers).  The flavor also seems a bit cleaner than the aroma, though it is definitely tart and funky.  The acidity here seems predominantly lactic in character and reminds me of tart grapefruit, some lemon zest, a touch of vinegar-like bite in the finish.  Other flavors that round things out are a slight, funky cheddar cheese note, something a bit like smoked almonds, a touch of saltiness (tied up in the previous note), a definitely tannic finish and some light, spicy oak notes there as well.  This somehow picks up a perception of sweetness to it, though I don’t think there is much in the way of residual sugars in this beer; it almost seems to be acidity based.  Light and quaffable, this beer also hides its alcohol quite well, which makes it all that much more drinkable.

My second pour of this is a touch more yeasty, which seems to soften the tartness a bit and also adds some raw, fermented dough notes (though only just a touch) as well as enhancing a cooked bread like character (sour dough to be sure though).  I easily polish off this 750ml bottle, though there is enough acidity to make my empty stomach feel a bit rumbly.  Worthy of the hype that I built up in my mind? I don’t know, but it is definitely worth the hype to try it.  It could use a touch more carbonation as a beer like this could always use a lively carbonation in my book.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3115,"2008-06-04",4.4,"Once again, a huge thanks to Vince over at the Port Brewery for hooking me up with a few tasters of this one.  I had just finished talking with Justin on the phone about how i wanted to try cable car and proximus when vince offered me a couple samples of each.  Needless to say, I was pretty stoked.  Anyway, thanks again Vince.  Pour was a hazy, murky yellow with pretty active carbonation.  A sweet citrusy funk fills your nostrils as its poured.  Slight floral notes blend in beautifully with light fruit scents.  The taste so complex that it took a few sips to really identify what i was tasting.

Firstly, a MAJOR thanks to wetherel for calling me and letting me know that a few bottles were in the cooler for sale. I wasnt planning on driving down from Carlsbad until I got that voicemail. Split the cost with Katie, we couldnt believe that more people werent buying them up. Just pure craziness to have two bottles of this rarity side by side as we drank with wetherel and alohaC at the bar. Its pants-creaming good. Hazy dark yellow color with medium white bubbles and swirls. Rich and rounded oak wood aroma with wet hay, lemon and biscuit tones with barnyard funk. All flavor components blend together amazingly well. Some citrus and light toast up front, with lighter barrel tones and brett acidity on the finish. Perfect amount of tartness, drinking multiple glasses was no problem. Slightly dry and a wonderful body. My first thought before I poured it was not to overrate due to hype, but all of my expectations were met. Flat out an incredible ale.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"

3115,"2008-05-25",4.4,"At the Toronado grand opening party, they had some bottles for sale.  It was surreal.  I wasnt really sure if I was looking at them, and if they were really for sale.  I asked a couple of people how much they cost, and they were guessing $60-$100, cash only.  I had $40, so I unpatiently waited to see someone who I knew who might chip in. I asked how much, and it was only $50, so I asked the guy sitting next to me (turned out to be carnevoodoo, from BA) if he would chip in $10.  He said yes, and also bought a pint of Abyss for me.  Thanks Derrick!  Wow.  So now I have a huge bottle of cable car sitting in front of me.  When you are used to small tasters, glass after glass of a super rare beer is almost indescribably awesome experience.  There was even enough to give large samples to the John, Christian, the bartender, etc.  I even finished the last sample from the bottle.  Oh the horror!  Yellow amber color.  Mild sour aroma.  Maybe a hint of acetic acid.  Flavor is delicious and the sourness is mellow and insanely easy to drink.  Perfect palate.  It would be wonderfully easy to drink in large quantities with meals.

This beer takes delicate to a whole new level, but if you give it enough attention, great flavors present them self. Awesome but subtle acidity, light lemon rind tartness, and just an elegant presentation of light funk and citrus sweetness.

3115,"2008-03-08",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2008 Poured from a 750 ml bottle, thanks to Zac.  Murky, glowing orange pour with a thin white film.  Wild, pungent, noxious aroma of compost, molded grass, wet carpet, quickly giving way to a pithy fruitiness of mango skins, white grapes, and pears.  Lots of mineral like tartness, wallpaper glue and quiet earthiness that brings some maple and honey sugars.  Unique and reserved, with broad character.  Flavor is slightly quiet, but not tepid; white grape notes of buttery Chardonnay and earthy Sauvignon Blanc, with hints of floral honey, apples, and pineapple.  Crisp and intricate, but still robust.  Plenty of lactic, slightly sweet oak that provides a perfectly played counterpoint to the already well-bridled tartness.  Tea leaves, white pepper, and lots of honey and milk in the mid palate.  Palate is velvety, slightly chewy, and soft; finishes with a bright pineapple and guava sweetness, very tropical, rubbing away with a funky dust of irish white cheddar settling on the back of the tongue.  A brilliantly balanced sour; acidic and lactic, smartly sour, and rounded with the right presence of sweetness.  Highly complex and very sophisticated.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Tart, sour and very pleasant on the tongue. Slightly minerally and gravelly almost along the lines of a Sauvignon Blanc. A light malt base behind the cheesy funk. Very lengthy tart and cheesy finish.

Pours transparent golden, capped with a minimal off-white head. Nose is tart, with some wild yeast, citrus,  and some earthy and herbal notes. Aroma is a bit restrained, and not over-the-top funky. Flavor is tart, with some citrus, grass, wild yeast, tropical fruit and white grape  notes adding complexity. Lively carbonation. Finish is long and primarily lactic. This is really well crafted and seems to emphasize some of the more subtle character of American sour ales, rather that going for intense, mouth puckering tartness.

3115,"2007-11-12",4.4,"GABF 2007, 750mL Bottles.  Multiple samples at GABF.  As much as Id love to have an entire bottle of this myself with which to sit down and spend some quality time, I feel the experience of trying several bottles and pour conditions revealed some interesting insight into this beer that I couldnt have obtained from just a single bottle.  That being said, if you are lucky enough to have procured a bottle of this stuff and are anxiously awaiting a chance to taste it, Id offer the following advice: Make sure you handle this beer carefully, give it plenty of time to chill and settle before opening, and be as anal-rententive as possible when pouring to make sure you dont disturb the yeast.  If sharing a bottle with multiple people, I would make sure to give myself the first pour to ensure maximum clarity.  I would also recommend not splitting a bottle more than three ways as this beer really shines on the subtle complexities that can only be unleashed with enough time.  This isnt one of those polarizing beers that shoves the flavors in your face.  I found myself tasting new flavor complexities even after 10 or so samples.  Finally, dont be afraid to drink this beer right now.  I cant really see this going down hill with age, but I also cant see it improving much from this level.  The harmony between acidity, funkiness, and body is perfect right now.The un-corking of the bottle unleashes a resounding ""crack"", which precedes an initial pour of mostly transparent gold topped with a thick head of brilliant white, billowy foam that clings lazily to the sides of the glass.  After the first 1/3 or so of the bottle is emptied, the pours get hazier and hazier, and with that the beer seems to drift further away from bright acidity and gets more muddled, woody, and funky.  The interaction between acidity, funk, and mouthfeel is amazing, and theres no need to offset that delicate balance.  A bright lemon acidity greets the nose immediately, along with some heavily brett-laced musty leather.  A light, milky balsa wood character wafts up, along with a distinct water chestnut wave.  Funky chardonnay skins and star fruit.  Light bodied, sizzling carbonation with a moderate acidity level.  The mouthfeel is simply amazing, so light, dry, and effervescent.  Blauw might be the only beer Ive had to date that could have a better palate than this.  Im always looking for sour beers to have that biting carbonation and sizzling mouthfeel to pair hand in hand with the acidic flavors, and this beer executes this feat perfectly.  Amazingly balanced flavor profile, bringing together subtle oak nuances, barnyard brett funk, and tart lactic acidity.  Insanely drinkable.   Bright lemon zest and sizzling gueuze-esque acidity jump out on the palate immediately, eventually giving way to some soft doughy malt flavors and more water chestnut.  White oak and young leather pucker up the finish a bit, adding some quenching dryness and earthy yeast.  As the flavors linger on the palate, the oak rests quietly in the background, off-setting a bold yet balanced acidity.  There isnt an overwhelming amount of funk in the finish either, and seems devoid of any lingering pedio cheesiness on the back end.  Incredibly ""clean"" and bright, and one of the best balanced sour ales Ive yet tasted.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

My wife and I shared this as our last bottle purchase of our 3-month roadtrip.

750mL bottle, generously shared by artusory.  Thanks, Ryan!!  Pours a hazy, toasty golden color; bright white head with brilliant, fine-bubbled lacing holding tight to the sides of the glass; a bit more clarity or retention and it would be perfect looking.  Probably the most satisfyingly aromatic beer Ive had in a while; the fruit character actually reminds me a lot of a certain Finger Lake (I know, but the whites can be excellent) reserve gewurztraminer wine that I havent had in years but still think about: tons of lime, dripping tree fruits (tropical, lychee), and sweet sweet honey notes, all surrounded by a mouthwatering tartness and funk and toasted oak; I couldnt stop smelling this.  Tons of citrus and tropical fruits (passion fruit, lime) at the core, but, unlike Castleton, where highly-carbonation citrus takes center stage, this has so much surrounding it: toasty, chardonnay-tinged oak and well-integrated sourness; not intensely funky, but some funk and mustiness and dripping, ripened fruit; better than the Cuvees, better than PH1, and equal to Blauw.  Excellent integration and depth.  Lengthy, tart and citrus and tropical fruit in the finish; when the tartness subsides, a soft doughiness appears at the very end.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
3115,"2007-11-07",4.0,"Clear straw. Dense and fluffy white head. Balanced nose of iron, lemon cake, hay, horseblanket, wool, melon, and vibrant oak. Hint of musty books. Natural carbonation is soft and expansive. Opens with a rounded lacto-derived acidity and snug oak accompaniment which firmly claps the palate. Pineapple esters explode at the core and mesh beautifully with the nuanced coconut and vanilla barrel extractives. All sorts of tropical complexities. Irony acid lends a quenching quality as well as some astringency before harmonizing with the supple fruitiness. Brett-derived phenols are extremely vivacious, snappy, and spicy, and bolster the vast array of subtleties. Straw-tinged-malt blossoms with a feathery daintiness and complements the faint but bright oaken sweetness. Finishes well-attenuated with a fluffy dryness, yet slickly and brightly fruity with a lingering kiss of coarse oak. Overall, quite polished, nuanced, and well-layered, all marks of a well made beer. Wasnt expecting a whole lot, but this certainly exceeded my expectations.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

3115,"2007-10-19",4.3,"Bottle at GABF and at kps: Pours a clear bright golden (unless you get the sediment) with a nicely-lacing frothy white head.  Aroma of tart, lightly cheesy, citrusy, and funky yeast with a nice biscuity Belgian maltiness.  Body starts with nice light malty sweetness and incredibly balanced funk and tartness toward a crisp, semi-dry finish. Very balanced and drinkable with a refreshing tart character throughout.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

Fruity oak and sour green apple flavor. Cinnamon and citrus notes. Sour tasting. Very nice.  Finish is vanilla.  Wow. Very drinkable. Well done. Delicious.","paramus, New Jersey, USA","mkobes"
3115,"2007-10-15",4.6,"Much thanks to Phatz for sharing this rarity of a gem.

Appears a hazy, light gold with a small white head that slowly fades into a mild cap. Lacing is scattered all over the glass like tiger stripes. Streams of CO2 quickly rise to the top.
Smell is of caramel, candy sugar, vanilla, barnyard, funky must, cinnamon, and cardamom, with a touch of apple.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas that meld together in a lemony zest, citrusy, sweet, funky, and tart blend that tantalizes the tastebuds into craving this different but enticing brew.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, full of candy orange, funk, with a dryness covering the palate with citrusy zest.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"

3115,"2007-10-14",4.7,"I must first thank metallitone1 aka (deftim13) for this spectacular treat. A better man have only walked the earth once, since the beginning of time. Tim you a great man and good friend, and I feel honored to have made your acquaintance. I sure hope Tomme Arthur makes more of this beer. It is worth the price you need to pay whatever that may be. I *love* sour wild ales and this is a masterpiece. 
This beer is quite different from but as good as Supplication [also provided by metallitone1]. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to share this beer with Hopdog, egajdzis, weeare138, froggyfrog, and Risser09.

Appearance: Pours a clear golden color with magnificent lacing on the walls of my snifter glass. The head is slightly off white and the carbonation is lively.

Smell: It has a huge bold sour cherries and Brettanomyces funky aroma that flood the nose with aged lambic like acidity is that the Pediococcus, I believe. Who cares! It is sensational. The citric rind, apple-cider vinegar woodyness and the plethora of magnificent indescribable aromas left me salivating like a dog. 

Taste: How could the flavor live up to such a grand aroma? IT DOES! Sourness, abounds with fruits and sweet and tart flavors that run the gamut. Apricot lemon cherry wood and large sour apple with a funky yeast and Lactobacillus presence that gives its spectacular sour attribute. It makes my mouth pucker in pleasure on each and every sip. There is a spice element clinging to my cheeks in the aftertaste, like cinnamon, vanilla and ginger along with the sourness. Each tastes beckons the next.

Mouthfeel: The sour sting and the light carbonation a fairly acidic body give this a very lambic-like mouthfeel. Dry and long-lingering.

Drinkability: If the Egyptians had it right with their tombs. I want my sarcophagus placed in a conditioning tank full of Cable Car so I can drink it for eternity. Otherwise, I am certain this will be the flavor of my heaven. This is a beer I could drink day and night, if only it were available. 

Hope this is helpful.
Cheers!","Paradise, Pennsylvania, USA","Phatz"

I did not get a lot of the grapes and cherries and all of that that everyone else got.  Definitely got the citrus and woody notes however.  
Very solid, but definitely in need of a re-rate.","Kirkwood, Missouri, USA","xmarcnolanx"
3115,"2007-10-11",4.7,"750ml, corked and caged bottle, shared courtesy of Phatz (thanks!, I guess I owe you my next new born). Poured a medium and lightly hazy (darker haze as we got towards the bottom of the bottle) golden color with a smaller sized off white head. Upon the first whiff, I was greeted with a plethora of incredible aromas that instantly put me in that special place in my mind! I could smell this one all day and night long. Aromas of cherries, grapes, apples, funky, brett, light yeast, citrus, and vanilla. All the aromas melded together perfectly. I was also getting a light spiciness, maybe cinnamon. Tastes of tart green apples, citrus, woody, light yeast and vanilla. Light and soft body.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"

3115,"2007-08-19",4.5,"Bottle from Toronodos 20th bday. Yellow to golden color just and a touch cloudy. About a finger of white froth. Smells like a sour champagne. The taste matches but with a lot of apple too. Stinging, sour, and clean. Lots of pretty cobweb lacing when your done. Very nice; and a  handsome bottle worth keeping.","San Francisco, California, USA","drawde"

3115,"2007-08-14",3.9,"Tap at Toronado. Pours with a nice hazy yellow color. I had it after the RR 20th Anniversary, probably the wrong order. It is mellower than the the20th, more fruit in nose and flavor. Some Belgian yeast and banana before a citrusy tartness takes over. Faint hints of oak as well.","Bay Area, California, USA","HopheadHans"
