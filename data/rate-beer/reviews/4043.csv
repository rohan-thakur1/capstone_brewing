4043,"2015-08-13",4.0,"Fresh bottle, hot off the shelves here in MA. Finally tracked down a god damned beer from this brewery and it did not disappoint. 22 oz bomber drunk 8/13/15.Hazy/murky/cloudy pour as is the wave of the future destined to look. But yet, as always, a massive, thick well-retained white head.Well, Ive definitely realized I dont like Galaxy hops, at all. The nose isnt so problematic with them, though the white peach and ripe apricot gets a bit punchy. In the flavor, however, while the hops arent resinous, theres still a shitload of some compound that, in large quantities present in these type of beers, really gives an aspirin-like flavor and also coats the mouth with a weird capsaicin-like lingering character. 20 minutes after finishing the beer its still here. Anyways, back to the beer, its very, very, very similar to Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point. Clean, wonderfully-textured, attenuated, supple malts comfort and balance. Lots of strong hop flavors, quite delicious even in spite of the galaxy hops. Still think Mr. Hill is doing even cleaner, less punchily/messy hopped pales up there, but this is certainly fantastic and only a slight tier below his better/best stuff.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
