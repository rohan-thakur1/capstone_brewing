109,"2016-10-07",4.1,"Bottle. Aroma is amazing Apple cider with brown sugar. Tastes very sweet but just under being cloying. Very rich. No booze at all. Great ice cider but not as complex and the best ones Ive had.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
109,"2016-04-23",4.0,"Light amber. Has a light appley nose. Sweet but theres some mellow fruitiness, lots of cinnamon and spice. The acidity is really nice, lends a fun sense of balance. Very good quality.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
109,"2016-04-20",3.8,"Pours a sparkling clear golden with some good legs. Nose is of tart apples and crisp apple skin. Taste is quite tart and not too sweet. Crabapples. Very faint brown sugar. Almost no signs of the alcohol except for a slight drying feel (or maybe it is some tannins?). Body is a bit light for an ice cider but it still manages to feel a little sticky. Overall I cant say I was floored by it but it was still pretty enjoyable, a little more residual sugar/balanced acidity and a more liquorous mouthfeel would have been nice though.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
109,"2016-04-06",4.1,"Tasting at Matts; 11%, corked bottleBlond color. Penetrating aroma, sour apples, a bit of stewed fruits. Sweet and very acidic, candi sugar, pineapple.Very nice.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
109,"2016-04-06",4.1,"Bottle - Nice balanced cooked Apple. Clear gold. Nice Apple sweetness with a touch of nectarine. Lite bite in the finish. Nice.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
109,"2016-04-06",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 7, 2016 375mL bottle, pours a clear golden with no head. Aroma is intense, with notes of brown sugar, caramel and treacle toffee. Flavour is complex as hell, with notes of treacle toffee, brown sugar and caramel. Lovely red apple quality to it. Medium-high sweet, but never cloying. Fantastic stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
109,"2016-03-14",3.6,"sample from slovaksniper, thanks pat! pours clear bright golden with some gummy legs. honeyed golden delicious apples, mead-like spiciness, pears and unripened bananas perhaps; perfumey and floral alcohol, lightly tart yet (it seems) out-of-control acidity; salted butter, soap, other minerals. flat carbonation, medium to full body; sweet and spicy finish. a pleasant sipper but a oh-so-not world-class ice cider. regular lafrance is clearly superior.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
109,"2016-03-07",4.2,"2 oz sample from bottle (200 ml) at home. 2010 vintage. Thanks to SlovakSniper for this one! Clear bright golden leaving some really nice sticky legs on the glass. Aroma showcases the spices (cinnamon, cloves) at first but its backed really nicely by baked apples, honey, floral notes, tart apples, alcohol and mild caramel-ish notes. Taste is a beautiful dance between fruit sweetness and sharp acidity while the cinnamon, despite being rather present, plays a second role alongside alcohol, baked apples, tart apples, tropical notes and honey. Medium to full body. Oily and sirupy mouthfeel. Sweet finish until the sharp acidity cuts it. Some alcohol warmth, but never burning. This one deserves his place among the best ice cider mainly because of the balance between sweetness and acidity but also because of the wide array of flavors and the pretty classy mouthfeel. Amazing stuff!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
109,"2016-03-06",4.2,"2oz sample. Crystal clear gold pour. Aroma is really spicy, honey, floral, nice fresh apple. Taste is sweet, really fresh, nice sweetness, caramel, crisp. Palate is full bodied, liquory. Delicious.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
109,"2016-02-14",4.2,"Robe dorée qui dévoile de longues jambes bien aguichantes. Un parfum de cannelle se développe à travers une riche avancée des pommes et des poires. Également, une montée florale importante que je pourrais attribuer au jeu de lalcool. Au goût, les fruits coupent les sucres grâce à une tranchante acidité. Jaime énormément cette impression. En bouche, le corps de moyenne densité révèle une texture légèrement sirupeuse. La finale aiguisée, un peu chaude, boisée, acidulée et mi-douce augmente considérablement sa buvabilité. Vintage 2010.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
109,"2015-09-01",4.2,"Bottle @ hotel. Brought back from Le Mondial des Cidres de Glace 2015. Clear dark golden beverage with some nice viscosity and legs. The usual deliciousness of ice cider is present here. Lots of baked apple, pie spices, and a touch of citric acidity. Good fresh, bright fruit character too. Slight maple, vanilla, and brown sugar...maybe some pie crust. Great body and mouthfeel as well.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

109,"2014-10-27",3.9,"200 ml bottle, 2010. Clear brass with a few bubbles. Nose is baked apple, slight cider vinegar and earthy peels. Sticky, syrupy medium body with a warming tang. Taste is green apple, pear, cinnamon and vanilla. Just a shade below the top ICs for me.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
109,"2014-03-29",4.6,"Bottle... This ice cider rocks!... Clear golden cider with sparse, but beefy legs. Heaps of fresh and funky fallen apples in the bouquet. Full-bodied and syrupy with no carbonation. The flavor is remarkable. Its every bit as acidic and sour as it is juicy and sweet. Delicious! Medium-length, tart finish. This awesome, world class ice cider was shipped my way by Marheb!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
109,"2013-01-10",4.4,"Bottle courtesy of Paul. Pours a thick, clear amber body with no head or lacing. Aroma is sweet apple slices.

109,"2011-07-12",4.4,"July 18, 2010. 200ml clear bottle shared by jerc & mabel with me and blankboy. 2006 vintage.  Deep gold, minimal head, huge legs left on the glass sides after a swirl - lovely.  One of the best ice cider aromas - 8+ - lightly acidic ripe apple, not baked, not too boozy or sweet - just .... apple, as it should be.  The taste follows - simple, pure apple, middling alcohol, no wine or regular cider character, again not too sweet - terrific, one of the best.  Perfect mouthfeel - not too thick, but not watery, acidic, a fairly long tangy/tart linger - want more!!","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
109,"2011-06-16",4.1,"2006 vintage, thanks Fred.  Pours a clear honey.  Nose is meadow, wildflower honey, sweet red apples.  Mouth is really thick, sticky, and sweet.  Spicy, very sweet red apples, intense, floral, lush.  Tart and sweet, decadent.  Body is thicker than any other ice wine Ive had.  Finish is pleasantly hot.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
109,"2011-06-03",4.1,"As with most Ice Ciders this is a stellar offering.  A dark gold color with a very concentrated apple aroma; faint hints of brown sugar as well.  The flavor is much the same, with an almost crystalline mouth feel as it lingers on my tongue.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
109,"2011-02-16",4.4,"Pouring at Le Mondial des Cidres Glaces.  Pours a clear gold.  Warm sweet apple aromas.  Super smooth and sweet with a light bite to it.  Slowly turns tart but keeping most of the original sweetness.  Long caramel and lingering acid on the finish.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

109,"2010-08-14",4.6,"2010-07-18. Dark orange body coats the glass. 3+ Rich aroma, sweet apple must hints at apple skins. Simple but lovely. Gorgeous flavour, super sweet fruit apple with pleasant acidity in the finish that lingers and keeps the overall impression a bit more balanced than it might be otherwise. It becomes eminently drinkable as a result. The more subtle nuances defy my description but this is very very good. 9+ Silky smooth medium to full bodied palate. Wow. Excellent. 2006 Vintage Bottle courtesy of Quevillon","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
