3338,"2016-10-25",4.5,"24/10/2016 @home - 33cl bottle from a trade with tderoeck.
Clear orange medium head leaving a small lacing. Nose is incredibly fruity (peach, grapefruit, mango, ...), a bit sweetness. Taste is all fruity again, sweet touch, bitter hops ending. Nice. At least one of their low alcohol IPAs should be brewed at a regular base. Please?","BELGIUM","Bierridder_S"
3338,"2016-10-21",4.8,"UPDATED: OCT 21, 2016 Mooi licht oranje van kleur met romige witte schuimkraag. Lekker fruitig in de neus. Mooi fruitig-bitter en lekker vol en romig in de mond. Perfecte balans met lange hoppige afdronk. Tropisch fruit, pomelo, lychee, perzik, beetje meloen. Totem did it again. Een bier van nog geen 3% abv zo barstensvol met smaak !! Na de Chac is dit alwéér een topper !!!","Terneuzen, NETHERLANDS","vincentvega72"

3338,"2016-10-09",4.5,"Très belle robe blonde, fine mousse. Un nez qui explose de notes dagrumes, de fruits exotiques, de mangue, sur un fond de houblon frais, de lélégance et de la complexité. Bouche délicieusement fraîche, amère et fruitée, dune élégance impressionnante avec une finale ultra raffraîchissante. Une bière de soif et de plaisir, à boire sans modération.","Mons, BELGIUM","Ysok02"

3338,"2016-08-29",3.8,"Draft, thanks Klaas.
Dorée présentant un léger voile orange, col épais jaunâtre persistant.
Arôme au nez fruité puissant tirant sur de belles effluves tropicales alternant entre mangue et un côté agrumes de pamplemousse, rétro fin malté + une certaine base levure apportant le caractère plus vivant.
Palais est juicy, tropical oscillant vers mangue avec un caractère grains assez marqué, du haut de ses 2.9% elle reste superbement légère et complexe. Pointe dépice et note herbacée.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
3338,"2016-08-25",3.9,"Draught at GBF, cheers Klaas! Thick, egg-white, dense, lacing head over a cloudy peach blonde beer. Delicate New World hops aroma of lime blossom, grapefruit flesh, moldy orange peel, mango, unripe pineapple, green banana, white bread and bakers yeast notes underneath. Vivid fruitiness in the mouth, raw pineapple, green banana and some apricot notes, bit fizzy, lightly oily mouthfeel, supple middle with a caramelly touch leading to a fragrantly aromatic hop finish, notably citrusy with hints of grapefruit and tangerine, spicy touch but not harshly bittering, very refreshing. Delicate thirst quencher, packed with flavor and not even feeling too thin for such a low ABV beer - I wish there were hundreds of different session IPAs like this in Belgium, for functional reasons (driving!) alone.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

3338,"2016-08-20",3.9,"Thank you for sharing! Sampled draft @ Gents Bierfestival 2016. Very hazy orange, little white head. Nose is massive hop, bit dank, rich overripe fruit, peach, apricot, low grapefruit. Taste is dank, hay, thick overripe fruit hop, low dough, grapefruit, overripe peach, Yeast is low. Hop is huge, making the body a bit hard to drink for me ironically, Hop is huge overripe stone fruit. Quite nice, I didnt go wild like the others did but I quite appreciated it all the same.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

Very hazy orange beer, irregular off-white head, pretty stable, little adhesive. Aroma: tropical fruit, caramel malts, slight hint of sulphur, grapefruit, tropical fruits, what an aroma bomb! MF: ok carbon, medium body. Taste: oh yes, thats the sweet spot baby! Tropical fruit overload, pineapple, passion fruit, grapefruit, soft sweetness from the caramel malts, citrus, lovely bitterness.
