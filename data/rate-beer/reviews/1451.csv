1451,"2014-10-08",3.6,"From fass at the brauhausEnd of barrel, 6-5-6-3-13=33. Chestnut color, clean, with generous compact head. It has a mild caramel aroma. The carbonation is high, the temperature too cold; the flavor focuses on rather dark caramel; the mouthfeel is smooth, but there is no residual sweetness; the roastiness is more evident in the end. Correct bitterness. Not exciting.Start of barrel, 7-5-7-3-14=36 It shows a bit of biscuity malt aroma. The flavor is similar, quite dry as well, less evidence of roastiness, better balance, very light biscuity malt too. Its better than the previous glass.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
1451,"2014-08-25",2.5,"Nice Version of the Duesseldorf famous Altbier. Relatively Sweet and less bitter than many other Altbier styles","","Kulle888"
1451,"2014-02-19",3.5,"Draught at the brewpub, end of November 2013. Ah yes, they make one beer and it is a very good one indeed. Light fruity aroma of ripe red apples but above all this is one malty beer - light toasted, light nutty, bready but also with notes of plums, especially in the long, pleasantly malty finish. Very nice, sticky mouthfeel, smooth with a medium bitterness, slightly herbal. The only problem Ive had with this one were the sulfury notes, noticeably especially in the finish. Get rid of them and this beer will be excellent.","Mikołów, POLAND","ElDesmadre"
1451,"2014-02-18",3.0,"Schöne braune Farbe, cremefarbener Schaum. Der Antrunk ist malzig-würzig, leicht süßlich-würzig. Ausgewogen weich. Im Hauptteil leicht nussig, würzig-malzig, etwas metallisch - wie Kupfer. Süßlich mit trockener Note. Der Nachgeschmack ist mittellang, nicht zu herb, leicht trocken.

1451,"2014-02-18",3.3,"Pours a clear orangish brown with a thick tan head. The smell is caramel, roasted malt, a bit of fruit and spice. The taste is roasted malt, fruit, a bit of copper flavor and licorice ending dry. Light in body and a bit oily with soft carbonation. An interesting take on an altbier.","Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, ENGLAND","ThirstyBird"

1451,"2012-11-11",3.7,"Draught at the brewpub.  Clear copper colur, small head. Roasty and mildly earthy. Medium bodied with rounded moutfheel. Some salty hops, pleasant earthy roastiness. Mid bitter finish. The deep malt character and excellent drinkability puts this among the classic altbiers to try.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
1451,"2012-05-28",4.2,"Dieser Ratinger hat für ein Alt eine recht gute Schaumkrone und sieht optisch auch sehr schön aus. Im Geschmack bemerke ich einen ganz leichten Citrus touch, Hopfen, röstmalzigkeit, die Geschmacksintensivität ist gut und überdurchschnittlich. Im Nachgeschmack ist es herb und leicht röstig und im Abgang leicht bitter. Fazit: Ordentliches Alt, empfehlenswert!

1451,"2011-06-10",3.5,"Aromatisch-malziger Antrunk, cremig. Am Anfang ist dieses Aroma eher süßlich, später eher herb. Weiterhin vollmundig und recht malzig, etwas hopfig im Mittelteil. Das Malz ist die ganze Zeit weit im Vordergrund und lässt die anderen Aromen mild aussfallen. Dennoch wirkt es ausbalanciert, sehr schmackhaft und süffig. Sauber!

1451,"2011-05-13",3.9,"Tap at Ratinger. Brown amber, offwhite lace. Light apples, pears in the nose. Fullbodied, sparkly mouthfeel.  fruity play, light nutty, clean well balanced flavors, light aromatic, good herbal hop bitterness. Really well made unpretecious brew, very moreish. Thanks to Pivnizub for recommending the place.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","jonas"
1451,"2007-06-10",3.5,"Darkish amber pour covered by a fair off-white head that mostly lasts. Ah yes, hoppier than most of the commercial bottled examples, this has some pleasant floral, fruity hop notes that later translate into a firm bitterness. Dry on the palate and displaying a finely developed mild fruitiness, though you would not pick individual fruits. As far as the malts go, they offer enoug body for one to take it seriously and focus mostly on dryish nutty flavors that contrast with the caramel sweetness I expected from the nose.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1451,"2006-06-19",3.8,"Nice big white head on top of a copper color beer, as would be expected of an Altbier.  Good amount of bitterness leads to a plesant dry finish with a tinge of sweetness.  Overall more bitter than some of the Dusseldorf breweries, but still less than Schumacher. (The brewer said he would like it to be more bitter than it is, but he had to adjust it so the ladies would drink it.)   Noble Hallertauer hop flavor plesantly balances with the caramel malt.  

Alltogether a plesant Alt in a nice small pub.","montvale, New Jersey, USA","ruffian"
1451,"2005-12-07",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 2, 2006 On tap in Ratingen: Amber coloured, fluffy, stable off-white head; shy sweetish malty aroma with a tinge of hops; bittersweet flavour, light bodied; pleasant mouthfeel; malty fruity finish with a distinctive bitterness; a pleasant, decent Alt, far better than the ""industrial"" Alts, but not on par with the Ddorf dems...................Re-Rate: Draught at ""Zur alten Fähre"", Kaiserswerth: Aroma improved: Noble bitter hops, mixed with caramell and some fruitiness;
now very well rounded, very moreish. No difference to the ""great"" Düsseldorfers.......","Bochum, Porúří, GERMANY","pivnizub"
1451,"2005-11-09",3.7,"(from the tap at the brewpub) Dark red-amber colour with a stable foamy beige medium head. Slightly sweet malty aroma with a touch of caramel and herbal hops. Bittersweet flavour, medium bodied, soft carbonated. Sweet and worty malty start, slightly fruity and a dry bitter hoppy finish with a distinctive liquorice note. Well-balanced and rounded Altbier, which comes close to the gems from Düsseldorf. Ratinger Alt is the only beer brewed at the brewpub so far, but Herr Ziglarski, the brewer, told me they want to expand the variety next year. I will frequently check out this nice little brewpub in the future.","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"
