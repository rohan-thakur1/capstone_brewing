3521,"2014-10-27",3.8,"At the brewpub: Pours dark blackish brown with a tan head. Aroma is earthy chocolate, light hops. Taste is simple, but really nice. Hoppiness is heavier than one would expect in an English iteration of the style. The sweetness is also very muted. Nice and earthy taste. Bittersweet chocolate is certainly present. Low carbonation body is really pleasant. If I was a British coal miner from the 19th century, I would be really jealous.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
3521,"2014-09-14",3.9,"[ Cask ][ 5oz ][ @F&M ][ $2 ][ mini-pint ][ 9/13/14 ]Hazy amber, puffy cream head craters but doesnt die. Dusty wood nose, light almond and orange with an earthy grass bitterness balance. Melon rind and orange early, papery bitterness alongside more caramel and orange mid. The earthy nut accents growing alongside low acidity and ultra-high attenuation thats light and coating through the finish. Thin body, cask low-carb, needing juicier elements and slightly bloated full feeling. All that said, this is very strong, excellent attenuation and balance.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

3521,"2014-03-07",3.5,"Draft at brewpub. Pours dark brown with khaki head. Nose is earthy, malty, brown sugary. Tastes vienna malty, smooth, with earthy and hop notes.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
3521,"2014-02-18",3.6,"On cask at the brewpub. At this point, Im beginning to think that these guys can do Session beer like nobody else, wrapping experience in crafting tradition with a few tweaks. This was good and had a nicely nutty edge to it, but wasnt overly complex and showed its light weight more than the Golden Eternity. Some almond-like creaminess, toothy molasses, and tight sugar. Delicious, but less captivating.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3521,"2013-06-28",3.5,"On tap at the F&M Brew Pub. Poured a brownish color with an off white head. Chocolate, some roast, caramel, and some floral hops.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"

Taste is thin but with a decent hop bitterness that lingers in the mouth. Malts are subtle and slightly sweet. Thin but oily mouthfeel.","Whalezbro, Illinois, USA","HighWine"

3521,"2012-09-08",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2013 Dark brown body (not black), medium off-white head, decent lacing.  Nose is highlighted by mellow chocolate and hints of caramel, toffee, and nuttiness.  Flavor has all of the pop of a chocolate stout with minimal roast--pleasant complementary notes of caramel, toffee, and bread. Light (very light) floral hop notes. Medium bodied, low carbonation from the cask, malty, without any real residual sweetness, lightly bitter.  Clean flavors.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
3521,"2012-04-13",3.8,"Draft at brewpub. Pours a coca cola brown with lots of nice white head. Aroma is faint, but shows some chocolate and slight roasty flavors.Taste is a lot more intense than youd expect for its ABV. Smooth chocolate notes with the faintest coffee notes mix with a very smooth palate. Really easy to drink on hand pump. Nice to see a mild ale at a brewpub too.","Ambler, Pennsylvania, USA","DeputyAndy"
