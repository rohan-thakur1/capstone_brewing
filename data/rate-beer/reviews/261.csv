261,"2012-11-25",3.3,"Bottle.  Pours clear pale gold and still.  Aroma is lightly sweet rice, some pear notes.  Flavor is rich rice, lightly fruity, and a dry finish.  Full body.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
261,"2012-03-14",3.7,"The aroma is of agave syrup-covered mushrooms and camomile tea. Appearance is pale gold with good saké legs. Taste is rich and almost malty, with a floral and banana finish. The most fascinating thing about this saké is to partake of the aroma after the main liquid has been finished. The remnants in the glass give an unmistakable scent of lilac, which is not at all present when sniffing or drinking the saké itself. Very nice!","New Jersey, USA","speter"
261,"2012-01-29",2.6,"Bottle. No head (still). Body is very light yellow. Aroma is notes of grain/rice, glue, alcohol, light note of melon rind. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery/oily texture, no carbonation, moderately alcoholic, lightly to moderately astringent. A clean but very plain sake.  Only the most basic, ordinary aromas.  Astringency serves as a balancer more than acidity. Drinkable but thats about it.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
261,"2009-05-02",3.4,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2009 very grainy, earthy and almost solventy nose on clear still liquid.  Watery palate and not much bite at at first. Peppery and almost ghostly botanical flavors..very earthy experience...missing is melon and fruits, in stead we have dirt and mold...in a clever sort of way, yet still a little disturbing","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
261,"2008-02-11",3.5,"One of the more enjoyable sakis I have had.  Very dry but takes on a good white-wine like viscosity and richness.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","dmtroyer"
261,"2007-12-14",3.5,"300 ml bottle from City Market in Burlington, VT (December 2007), sampled chilled from a White Winter Winery glass.  Almost entirely clear, with just a faint oily haze, thin and barely discernible legs forming as it swirls, dying immediately....aroma is buttery and toasty, with light baked or broiled fruit (coconut, papaya) notes, very subtle and delicate; little alcohol presence noted....lightly grainy on the tongue, fairly sweet, alcohol moderately present but growing somewhat strong and slightly hard towards the finish; citrusy notes, a touch of cider....slightly syrupy at first, dries out with the strong alcohol late in the tasting....unlike every other sake Ive had, Im actually enjoying this more as it warms up a bit; no, it wont be best at room temperature, but it actually seems smoother and more open after 10 minutes in the glass.  Definitely a sipper, this one.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
261,"2007-10-09",3.2,"Aroma of vanilla, toasted almonds and koji yeast. Hint of tropical sweetness. Pours pale, pale yellow. Almost clear. Nice sticky legs. Fairly dry on the palate with some cashew and almond nuttiness. Oily. Medium bodied. Finishes very dry with some alcohol astringincy.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
261,"2007-09-05",3.5,"The second sake in our flight at Indras Mead, Cider and Sake Tasting on 8/31/07. Pours crystal clear, virtually indistinguishable from water. On the nose is a round banana, alcohol and a light phenolic note, not quite as nice as the Dreamy Clouds. Light to medium-bodied and silky smooth it finishes with a ""warm"", dry conclusion. The flavor is what I would imagine youd get if you created a banana liqueur/vodka hybrid with a relatively low ABV. While there is a little heat, its far from distracting. I rather liked this one, as well.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"
261,"2007-09-02",2.9,"Looks like  water.  Banana, perfume, flowers, and alcohol aromas.  Flavor is the same.  Not as good as the first one.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
261,"2007-09-01",3.0,"Second Sake of the night at the Indra - Cider, Sake and Mead tasting 8/31/07.  Pour is nearly clear water.  Perhaps a twinge of yellow, but really hard to distinguish from water.  Aroma of powerful rice alcohol much more forward than previous Sake Aroma I have experienced.  Some banana fruitiness in the flavor, though mostly over powered by the alcohol.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
261,"2007-08-09",3.6,"Water clear with just the slightest straw colored tinge.  Aroma is a interesting blend of fruit and rice, like some sort of asian dessert.  This is not a sweet sake, but there is just a tiny hint of sweetness that rounds out the mouthfeel and flavor.  Flavor is of honeydew, with a slighty ricey finish.  Very nice.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","RCL"
261,"2006-11-03",3.7,"300mL bottle.  Pours clear with the slightest tinge of yellow.  Upon agitation, legs occur immediately, and stick around for a couple minutes.  Aroma of melon, vanilla, rice, alcohol.  Some melon sweetness in the middle into a nice, dry finish.  The flavor follows the aroma.  Medium bodied, warming alcohol--especially in the back of the throat.  Still havent had a ton of sakes, though I did like this one.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
261,"2006-07-08",3.7,"Slight hint of yellow when held to the light. Tall long legs as it sits. Aromas of vanilla and almonds. Flavors of coconut milk and alcohol. A little almond joy flavor in the linger. A clean well made sake.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
261,"2006-07-03",3.7,"Sample  thanks to 1FastSTi.  Strong vanilla and white chocolate with noticeable alcohol.  Clear as water with nice legs that stick to the glass.  Interesting flavor, vanilla, oak, alcohol, chocolaty, flavor lasts and lasts. Very interesting.  Medium-full body, sweet but not too sweet.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"
261,"2006-06-25",3.5,"Approximately $13 for a small bottle of this.  I decided to try it and brought it to the Tosa tasting.  The sake pours to a watery looking body with decent legs.  The flavor is rice, vanilla, white chocolate, floral components.  The aroma is quite floral.  Some rice, vanilla, white chocolate, and cookie dough.  The palate is nice.  Slick feel.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
261,"2006-06-25",3.5,"Hello Sake, here we go! Clear color, no different than water except the legs walking down the sides of the bottle. Aroma is strong alcohol, like a nice perfume. Flavor is smooth, not a lot of alcohol, a little coconut,","Mississippi, USA","Mangino"
261,"2006-04-10",3.4,"crystal clear liquid which pours out of a bottle exactly matching the photo here.  butter and cream aroma, along with a liquidy ricy smell which is hard to describe aside from ""rice"".  smooth and dry, like ""vodka jr."" slightly perfume-like floral flavors (rose hips, butter, soy sauce/salt).  light and aromatic, with a semi-dry finish and clean crisp flavor.  completely inoffensive, if that serves as a compliment.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
261,"2005-12-30",3.3,"Bottle.  Nice rice wine, butter, soy sauce and alcohol aroma.  Light yellow color.   Initially very waterlike then rice  and soy flavors gradually come out and finishes with a mild alcohol burn finish.  A fairly subtle and clean tasting sake - well balanced with no flavor coming out too strong.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
261,"2005-04-26",3.7,"This bottled Sake was server in a small bottle at a local restaurant.  It was served cold at 45 degrees and poured a clear body with a few transparent bubbles.  It had a strong rice wine Sake aroma.  Its mouth feel was smooth initially with a burning alcohol finish that dances on the palate after swallowing it.  It had a strong vinous rice Sake flavor that was clear and crisp.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
261,"2004-08-30",3.5,"Light beige, very oily appearance. Aroma is very floral with light buttery & marshmallow notes. The flavor is very neutral & delicious, finishes somewhat dry & has only a light touch of alcohol. Good Junmai but the price is not right on this one at $14 for that little bottle in the picture.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
261,"2004-04-19",1.4,"This was my first exposure to sake.  Clear as crystal, the aroma was fanitly floral.  The taste was just hard alcohol.  Being new to sake, my description lacks substance but my experience with tasting this left much to be desired.  Will have to try more to make more educated evaluations.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
261,"2004-01-05",2.6,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2004 A little rough, though far more drinkable that most sake.  I'm probably being a touch critical as I had it side-by-side with ""Divine Droplets"", ""Star-Filled Sky"" and ""Pride of the Village"", all fantastic sakes.  Many will like the Tentaka's lack of oiliness/butteriness and its extreme lightness of flavor.  On the dryness scale, its nihonshu of +3 seems accurate as it is semi-dry.  Where the Tentaka falls short (and perhaps I'm being overly critical here) is that for a junmai its alcohol is somewhat noticeable and burns a bit going down.  But you get what you pay for and Tentaka is cheaper than a ginjo.  Having the faintest yellow tinge in color, Tentaka Kuni has a mild flavor of wet paper with a light floral aroma and taste.  Make that VERY light.  Though not competitive with most ginjos, this Tentaka Kuni is far, far better than futsu-shus like Gekkeikan Sake and Hakusan.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
