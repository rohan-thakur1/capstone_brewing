97,"2017-01-26",3.5,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is odd with a light chocolate and coffee roast note. Some toasted bread as well as toffee and nuts. Very herbal and phenolic with what smells like mint, allspice and pepper. Light citrus, raisin and fig notes. 
Pours a brown color with amber hues and a medium large, moderately thick and frothy, tan head that recedes somewhat quickly to a thin film that lingers on the edges. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor is better than I was expecting. Moderate malt notes with some toffee, nuts and toasted bread. Hints of chocolate and roast. Some light raisin, fig and prune notes. Light acidity and medium low bitterness. Medium light mint notes with lighter allspice, pepper and clove. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a better beer than I was expecting base don the aroma. While it is weird, the beer kind of works and the herbal notes are lighter in the flavor than in the aroma. One thing I really like about this and other Fantome beers is how the acidity, while present, is nowhere near as strong as in some of the popular American saisons.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

97,"2014-07-15",0.8,"Reviewed from notes. 
This was poured into a snifter and a tulip. 
The appearance was a decent looking hazy orange to yellow color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. There was some light lacing after the head dissipated. 
The smell was leathery with an extremely soured barnyard funky tartness. 
The taste was mainly the leather again with all of that other stuff going on. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium with I guess somewhat of some sort of sessionable quality about it.
Overall, wow, what in the name of tarnation is this foul swill. I am thinking a donkeys ass might smell at least smell and look better. Im not going to even bother going to the taste. My sink doesnt even deserve the drain pour.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

97,"2014-01-27",3.7,"Bottle: pours a super murky, brown-ish & dingy, dark copper color with low head formation; only a timid, beige & gray-tinted ring slowly forms around the edge. Aroma has some tart-ish apples up front, very small lacto character with a touch of lemon flesh, wet hay, light barnyard funk, sweet strawberry, & a candy-like sweetness, very similar to Pez candy... Ive gotten the same aroma from bottles of the regular Saison. Taste has lots of fruity esters... again I get strawberry Pez but also a plum & peach character on the back-end. Mild tartness with bales of wet hay, funky old cotton, & a finishing touch of toasty malt. Smallest hint of smoke, but nothing off-putting. Somewhat creamy body, feels lighter than 8% ABV. Pretty nice saison overall. Doesnt touch the original (the good bottles, at least) but this was still quite tasty with a nice, low level tartness.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity and spicy yeast esters.  Taste of pear, apple, cherry, strawberry, pepper, clove, hay, straw, grass, floral, caramel, bread, light leather, light funk, and herbal earthiness.  Lightly tart fruitiness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark and light fruits, pepper, clove, hay, straw, grass, floral, caramel, bread, light leather, light funk, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit.  Very nice complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt/spicy ester balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish.  Medium carbonation and body; with a slick, fairly crisp, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice.  Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish.  Overall this is a damn nice farmhouse ale.  Nice balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast esters; very smooth to sip on.  A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
97,"2013-03-23",3.5,"750mL bottle.  Poured medium, coppery-orange with a spotty, but well-retained beige head.  The aroma picked up bright juniper, caraway, blood orange zest, and a kiss of star anise over soft, almost nutty malts.. very interesting.  The flavor found sour, somewhat metallic notes and juniper on the tip of the tongue, with lemon zest and a bunch of spices behind and around.. the juniper really led.. tangy, spicy, oaky finish.

97,"2012-12-06",3.7,"Shared by drabmuh. Thanks Matt.

Sampled alongside twenty other Fantôme beers.

The beer appears a rusty, orange brown color. Mild haze with a small tan head after a careful pour. The aroma offers herbal, floral, funk, fruit, vegetable, and yeast scents. A lot of stimulus for the olfactory senses. The taste brings some apple notes, along with a light spice, though not with the same intensity as La Gillmoir or BBB Dark White. Candied apples and a fruity sweetness are balanced by a light funk. Medium to light bodied. Good feel. I would definitely have this again.

IT pours a murky brown with hints of plum and lots of sediment. The head is foamy and of white and rather large. It recedes pretty slowly but with not much lacing.

The smell is hard to pinpoint. It smells a lot like strawberries. There is perhaps some currant as well. It has a noticeable funk that almost brings up acidic vomit. It also has some lemony acidity to it. There is also a decent amount of spiciness to it.

The flavor is utterly bewildering. It is like mint berry. It has like a mintiness about it as well as some fruitiness, mainly tart currant/cranberry. There is a mild sourness and also some cherry. It has a very medicinal flavor as well. It isnt too sweet, but has a lingering sweetness amidst the funk and sour. The other component here is the spices, it tastes a lot like maybe some sage, nutmeg, ginger, and definitely mint. It definitely has a holiday tinge to it.

Overall it is a quirky beer that I cant say I will ever go back to but it was interesting.

Pours a red-hued umber, like the color of clay, with a slightly vanilla head. Theres some lacing, but its thin and recedes down the side of the glass quickly. Second pour is cloudy, like dirty water.

Lovely nose. Some lemon acidity, a strong aroma of green apples, some light fruitier notes, and some herbal spiciness. Surprisingly sour on the nose.

Some acetic character in the mouth, but a stranger mixture meets the tongue; I get some ginger, pepper, old mint, grassiness, muted muskiness, and other earthy notes. The sourness is more muted than on the nose, but I do pick up on some maraschino cherry and apple. Medicinal bitterness runs throughout the palate, which can be off-putting, especially early on, but the tongue grows accustomed to it. An interesting combination.

Herbal, slightly dry finish.

I expected a little more body given the color of the beer (which suggested some maltiness), but SG drinks well for its ABV. I like this, particularly in the nose, but the odd bitterness distracts, and the spicy, herbal notes are indiscriminate and run together. It tastes a bit like the kitchen sink; though this was partly my expectation, I wish the clean sourness in the nose came through more in the mouth.

97,"2010-09-22",3.9,"750 ml bottle. A hazy/cloudy dark amber beer with a large, frothy, mostly diminishing beige head. The aroma is lightly malty, lightly hoppy, lightly to moderately yeasty. There are notes of toasted grains, barnyard, medicine, cinanmon, ginger, rhubarb, oregano and other herbs (mayne basil). The flavour is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Very medicinal weird and complex. Medium body, lively carbonation, long finish with about medium bitterness, well hidden alcohol. Its extremely hard to explain all the sensations I have after smelling or drinking this beer. Lots of herbs and spices, complex, maybe not hugely drinkable as other Fantomes. More watery than expected, but no alcohol felt, no signs of age and above all really intriguing and fascinating as always from Dany. A successful experiment.","Firenze, ITALY","Slayer85"

Great earthy/yeasty flavor that is quickly complimented by strange herbal qualities.  Im picking up hints of chevril, mint, celery-seed, and who knows what else.  Also has a nice cool cucumber aspect that helps clean out and unify all the ingredients.  There is a ghost in this bottle, and its name is Innovation.  I love Fantome for their eccentricity.

Stovetop Stuffing in a box. Thats the name of the game here. Pours a deep and attractive copper with a modest head. Herbal nose, dominated by mint tea and sage --- which while fading in the midrange, comes back on the far long end of the palate. Very herbal-spiced, slightly sour, good malty midrange flavors, and that mint oil coming back in late as if Id had a mint tea.Its interesting, but Im not sure its good.

Flavor is different... the spices from the aroma are there with some lemon, spicy yeast and bready malts.  Palate is sticky and tart but a little thin.

Pours a darker clearish red-amber, with a soft soapy white foam. Flavor reminds me of sticking my head in an old medicine cabinet. Mint hangs on a little into the chemical land. This reminds me of wandering through a hippy store. The malt falls thin and then exposes a mix of meidicinal grass stems. Bouquet garni. A very different beer. Eventually, this warms up and develops a lot of complexity. The herbal character in the flavor lends to a refined palate. Mature. Finishes on a very nice yeast character flourish.

97,"2008-11-27",4.3,"Fantome may be one of the most underrated breweries on the site.  Each beer comes across as being so well made and unique, while still being definitely Fantome.

Medium / light body that’s nice and creamy smooth with very gentle carbonation.  The flavor starts with a bright sweet citrus aspect, sweet / tart graininess, chamomile, rooibos, touch of giner, light sourness, odd mushroom and nice yeasty funk.  The finish is a nice blend of everything mentioned with a very fresh taste even though this has a bit of age on it.

The nose certainly has some interesting aromas in there, not just the ubiquitous funk but a very dry herbal quality mixed with menthol and some cooking spices like sage and thyme. It resembles mint in places but it’s got a cooling quality that’s certainly like menthol - maybe juniper as some reviews have suggested (my palate doesn’t recognize it)? At any rate, the combination of the frosty flavors with the dry, herbals and the funk is a quirky one, very Fantome indeed.

97,"2008-04-02",4.2,"first off, this is definately a strange beer, as the name implies, and probably not for everyone. I however found this to be one of the most interesting beers Ive had in a loing while. Pours a sort of muddy amber brown with thinnish head, patchy lacing. The aroma takes you by storm. Herbaceous as allo hell, grass, pepper, minty, savory herbs, slight sour funk. The flavor is much the same focusing on mint, thyme and rosemarry I think. There is a definite sour character as well as some fruity esters. The flavor is complex to say the least. Nice tingly body ends on a dryer pleasantly bitter note. I paired this beer with a rabbit dish my friend cooked and I think that no other beer could have done such a perfect job with the dish. I have note tried this beer without food and I suspect that it serves better as an accompanyment rather than just a session beer. Still this is a wonderful beer that everyone should try once.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Davinci"

Cloudy, rusty amber color, head is uneven and lasting.

Very thin and smooth on the palate, body is surprisingly light as well.  Alcohol is nigh undetectable.  This is simply undefinable, even compared to the other Fantomes Ive had.

Spicy and herbal aromas of mint, anise, and orange peel jump out right away, satisfying, but a little bit naked, as theres only a faint whiff of biscuity malt to back it up.  Earthy yeast aromas with a touch of peppery spice.  Its hard to pick out the malt and hop characters, but the mint spice and earthy, peppery yeast phenols are especially prominent.  Light bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel with a thin, almost papery texture.  This doesnt taste oxidized to me, but the body is just really thin.  Spicy lemongrass and grains of paradise add some bright zest to the flavors up front on the palate.

Herbal crazy nose of super high pitched bittersweet floralness and raw lemon. Dandylions, wheat grass, white grape, corriander, and other uniquely herbal aromas bring a brigade of dizzying sniffing enjoyment each time its taken in. Has just a touch of barnyard stuff buzzing about, but the spicey herbal character remains quite true, strong, and beautiful. Awesome nose!

Taste is nearly as dizzying but somehow comes across nice and mellowing with a solid herbal tone over a smallish toasted pale malt and bready doughy sweetness. Kinda honeyish really, especially as it goes, with a solid mix of raw orange and lemon ascents, all the while keeping a firm little creamy sense and a wonderfully natural spicey kick that delivers a uniquely floral, fauna, earthy, grassy effect. A surprise awaits nearly every sip that wraps up all sorts of herbs and spices thatll keep ya guessing.

Feel is about medium, actually kinda dulled in comparison to the overall spicyness it carries. Which is, again, a unique complexity to the overall, taken in conception of how the beer is moving. It has a certain yeasty grab and underscored malty tang, but the complex spices and herbs really turn it into a whole nother complexion of texture and tone.

Wow, this has an immense complexity about it that fits the Fantome family very well. I really liked how it wasnt over the top all that much as its funkyness is quite tame. The sourness well controlled and the bitterness well-rounded in earthyness of herbs and grasses.

A creamy light beige head.  The aroma is spruce, Christmas trees, lemon extract, saison spices and yeasts.  The flavor is what I would expect to find if I ate a pine Christmas smoke candle with odd spices.  The palate is bitter and waxy with a ton of spices.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"

Taste is also a lot of ginger... not a lot of sweetness like ginger ale... just straight-up ginger.  This is a strange beer.  If I were more of a ginger fan, I might be into it... but not so much.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","DeweyDell"
97,"2007-11-04",3.2,"750ml bottle.  Pours a burgundy/maroon color with not as much head as Im used to with this company.  Aroma is strange.  Christmas like, ginger ale, mint, spicy, peppery, gin, the color green, pine cones, sweetness, cinnamon.  Very complex, dont know how appetizing it smells but its very complex and strange.  The only thing Id feel confident in saying is definitely in there is ginger.  Taste is strange too.  Sweaty, spicy, gingery, a little bit smoky.  Weird peppery finish.  Fantome is one of my favorite breweries and this is certainly an interesting beer but I think its a failure overall.  Definitely not up there with their other stuff.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

Some herbal notes and more spices.  Color is a hazy dark orange.  Lively in the mouth with more mint and pepper.  Dry and spicy with some citrus notes.   Soft mouthfeel along with some dry chalkyness.  A little bit too much mint for my liking.  Also, there is about 3/8 inch of sediment in the bottom of this bottle.  Finishes herbal and minty.

Heck I even thought for a second I tasted wasabi (its the ginger...kinda a sushi vibe). A very slight bit of chocolate in a bready package with citrus, lemon and lime. The rosemary in the aroma seemed to be Italian spice or Herbs de Provence and perhaps a smidge of sage. Tons going on, all of it tasty. The body was medium and the carbonation a bit low.

Tastes include sassafrass, more lemon, mint, parsley, musty earth, orange zest, slight hand soap, and the whole kitchen spice rack. Medium carbonation and full-bodied.

Aroma is very mild while the beer is cool but as it warms, theres a real interesting mix of cocoa, mustard, wood, herbal teas (mint, echinacea?).  Its definitely funky in a wild yeast way, but very earthy, and the yeast is an ingredient, not the feature.  Tart woody and leafy taste, very tingly like mustard (but without really tasting like it), and very dry.  Finishes very dry, woody and subtle but noticable hop flavor that yields little bitterness.  Dry, earthy, funky, and tart is how Id describe this beer, but the flavors are so well blended its very tough to decipher.  Apparantly they put tons of weird spices and stuff in their beers, but they did it well cause I can barely notice any adjunct qualities.  Medium mouthfeel, drinkable, and slick.

Fantome Strange Ghost.  First impressions of the aroma would be ginger and apple cinnamon, with some lighter notes of cardamom, medicinal maple, and finally some heavy bran muffin and yeast scents. It has a very strange flavor, probably one of the weirdest beers Ive ever had, with flavors of bran, crackers, ginger, a certain “dog food” flavor, and some sweet oranges and sugar, most notable in the back.

Very unique aroma that is dominated by peppermint, with an agave nectar sweetness, flowers, and a tea-like herbaceousness.  The flavor doesnt show nearly as much mint as the nose.  It is present, but the taste turns towards lemony with minty highlights.  Again, the agave-like sweetness is there to mellow the minty-lemon tea flavors.  Mild herbs add to the complexity.

97,"2006-05-07",3.2,"Hazy amber colour.  Minty aroma with dusty yeast, camphor or menthol-like phenols...strange indeed. The flavour is hugely spicy, evocative of things like mint, anise, cinnamon and oregano, with a little bit of malt background.  There is also some unpleasant ashy astringency (to recreate, try eating a spoonful of dried thyme).  Quite sweet as well, in a manner reminiscent of candyish, herbal sodas like Vimto (Saudi version) or  Antarctica Guarana.  Certainly this beer provides very eclectic references. And as is true with all Fantomes it grows on you over the course of a 750 (drinking a Fantome in any serving size less than 750 should be criminalized) but it still pales in comparison with most of Danys other efforts.  It is whacked out, but the elements dont come together in any compelling way the way that they do in most of his brews.  You arent left breathless and begging for more at the end of this, which for a Fantome beer may as well be a damning indictment.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

Herbal, somewhat tart lemon and cream flavor. Has a chlorophenolic pool toy character with mostly dry, aspartame bitterness.

97,"2006-04-13",3.1,"Darkish rufous. Fine layer of thin, but rocky and creamy, white foam. Vibrantly herbaceous nose with a medley of juniper, white pepper, and candied ginger. Softly carbonated. Intensely herbal bitterness immediately holds the palate hostage while overstated juniper follows suit and produces little more than an unpleasant medicinal pungency. All this brashness is compounded by aspirin, fresh lemongrass, and a hard tonic-like accent. Mustiness is unfortunately imperceptible. Weightless  honey-drizzled biscuity malt sweetness briefly disperses the oppressive sharpness, only to take backseat to the reemergence of more harsh grassiness and peach fuzz. At times this is uncannily similar to biting into a lime peel or juniper berry. Quite invigorating, however, as a result of the tight and gritty candied ginger flavors which, in turn, complement the understated alcohol. Body packs enough moist density to keep the brashness from becoming too punishing in the latter half. Finishes less intense than with it started, though tongue numbing notes of juniper and candied ginger linger for what seems like an eternity. Aromatically speaking, this is somewhat pleasant, but its far too one-dimensional as Im picking up very little mustiness or hop character. And while the malt is cleanly extracted, its far too subtle to handle the unruly brashness. Youve gotta adore Danys risk-taking attitude even if, from time to time, near-disasters are the end result.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Very spicy nose with mints, cough syrup, spices, fruits, and caramel. The first few sips were just shocking... was this beer or medicine?

I cant pinpoint everything but overall it is very medicinal like menthol or eucalyptus with mint and basil and a background of woody, malty saison. Everything about this is herbal-i feel like it is familiar like ive smelled this aroma coming from a skin cream or muscle rub or something. Flavor is the same-dominated by various herbs. Unlike other spiced beers, you wont need to strain to detect the flavors, youll have to strain to detect the beer. Palate is musty and earthy with other herbs coming up.

There are just as many herbs taste-wise as there are in the aroma.  A lightly malty base with some sage and lime.  The finish is a little bitter and drying with just a touch of pepper.

Clearly, this ghost is going to be an herbaceous onslaught.  The spices and vegetable traits assault the nose so quickly that its hard to record everything thats shooting up the nose.  Here we go: ginger root, anise, limes, sour lemons, ginger snap cookies, coriander, nutmeg, cumin, orange flavored toffee, cattails and cottonwood.  Caraway seeds register a little later, but provide the bridge from the nose to the mouth.  Cumin flavor is dead on.  Ragweed, dandelions, marigold and pollen as well.  Jeez.  Some chick peas and tahini.  Good gracious - strange indeed.  If this materialized into solid matter, thered be an allergenic epidemic.  Seemingly lighter fairing, save the garden shock overcome with weeds ganging up on the palate post sip.  Fairly well balanced with effervescence vanishing a little too early.  Finish is laden with dried out wood scraps in abandoned prairie fields, along with coriander, moderate limes and cumin to bring the pollinated performance to a close.  Quite the thinker.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

The spiciness hits the back of the tongue in the form of black pepper, all spice and sour yeast.

The beer pours medim amber color with a big off white head that is mostly retained.  The aroma is a conundrum of scents.  Licorice, anise, and light bready malt are buried under a cheap cologne, massive spicy aroma.  Very unique flavor profile as well.  Flavors of cologne, tons of spices and some meaty, smokiness.  This beer is totally about contradictions and the conflicting parts seem to pull in all different directions.

97,"2005-11-23",3.3,"Drinking a yet untried Fantôme ale is always an adventure. This hazy amber brew with a creamy beige head reminded me of being in the secondary waiting room at a doctors office, the room you go into after waiting an hour, take off your clothes, sit on a stainless steel table, and wait another hour.  Why? Because the aroma is strongly medicinal, like the antiseptics that you smell in such a place.  The blending of spices and herbs goes wild in the nose (mine, at least), what with the additional mint, tea leaves, ginger, chamomile, pepper, nutmeg, lilacs, pine needles.... Its soft in the mouth, gently carbonated and is a mixture of malt, medicine, and soap - -  but somehow remains an enjoyable drink.  Im not giving this a very high rating, but rather an appreciative one.  Ill be trying this again (n again) to try to make some sense of it all.  Which may be futile.

Pine, rosemary, juniper, sage, sweet caramel, light citrus, cinnamon, white pepper, freshly cut grass and shrubs, a touch of brown sugar, orange zest and maybe some light alcohol.  A retronasal experience shows bits anise and perhaps a little living vegetation.   A nice, full body with a light, soft carbonation.  The flavors are cooler than I expected from the nose.  The sweet malt backbone meshes superbly with the fairly strong herbal character.  The interplay of sweetness and spicy, bitter herbal qualities are really unique.

You get herby flavors of pizza type spices (oregano, thyme, etc.), very interesting and in no way is it bad.  Body is light and watery, in a refreshing way.

The most varied mix of spices as I have ever smelled...You got mint, ground pepper, basil, thyme, lavander, cloves, its like he emptied his spice rack in there!  And it was something new at every whiff.  Unbelievable stuff. 
Pretty complex taste, quite heavy on the spices.  In fact, it reminded me of my Dads spaghetti sauce!  The aftertaste had the bitterness of dandelion leaves.  The alcohol was nowhere to be felt, an impressive feat for an 8%.  I thought Id get tired of it after a while, but not at all.  Im glad I have a few more to cellar.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"
97,"2005-08-28",3.8,"Sampled August 2005
Pours a slightly hazy,  pretty, ruby-orange color that is topped by a light cream-tan colored head that is held aloft by a persistent, good carbonation.  Wow, the aroma is quite interesting, it is fully herbal with notes of sage, thyme, rosemary & pine being quite evident.  Underneath the herbs is a nice fruitiness reminiscent of plums and raisins, there is a bit of a tart citrusy note here too.  Reminds me a bit of a German herbal liquor.

The taste is fairly dry up front, with just an ever so soft touch of sweetness.  As the herbal qualities of this beer take hold, it dries out considerably in the finish.  What an interesting beer, I really almost dont know what to say.  The beer has a definite tartness to it, which is especially evident in the first half of a draught of this beer.  The tartness and the fruitiness of this beer make me think of a tart orange.  As this beer warms up it becomes quite a bit softer and smoother as it looses some carbonation as well.  The herbal note is still quite evident though with Sage leading the lineup.

This beer is almost an aperitif, it would be perfect preceding a night of noshing on roasted lamb, but the herbal character also make it useful as a digestif.  All in all a very interesting beer from Dany.  I really am enjoying this, even though the balance is perhaps a little bit too much on the herbal side.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

97,"2005-08-08",4.0,"Bottle.  Hazy orangey amber pour.  For the aroma, all I can say is ""Holy Rosemary Batman"".  The aroma was loaded with rosemary.  Other herby components come through as well, I noted sage here as well.  Also a little earthy funky notes.  Huge floral and herby flavors as well - tons of rosemary.  Some earthy funk and grassy notes too.  And a moderate malt backing, so it didnt seem like I was drinking herby water.  Almost unnoticable bitter end.  Maybe Im just sensitive to rosemary, but it took me back to when I used to grow herb plants, and my rosemary bushes were always the most fragrent.  I loved this beer, but for me, the intense rosemary obscured other more delicate flavors and aromas.  I agree with goldtwins too - because of its huge herbiness, this guy would go awesome with certain foods that couple with sage and rosemary.","Norcross, Georgia, USA","beeryum"

All that was in the aroma is there and it makes for a unique experience. An almost overwhelming mint-pine flavor dominates all throughout. It is quite bitter, though not in a hoppy way.

This was certainly a unique beer - one that caused me difficulty putting my finger on the exact spices I was smelling and tasting.  Deep rusty-copper-amber, near opaque, with a small lasting beige head.  Aroma: Theres a lot going on in this aroma dominated by herbs.  Rosemary, basil, lavender, pencil shavings, yeast, ceder, tree bark, and sweet malt all make their appearances at times.  Taste: I sat around with my friend discussing this, trying to nail it down.  We came to this conclusion: Eucalyptus, mint, pepper, sage, thyme, green planty flavors, stale hops, green tea, with an earthy sweet caramel malt adding to the sweetness.  Quite sweet and cloying(without going over the top), lively carbonation, full creamy mouthfeel, does dry somewhat in the finish.

97,"2005-06-09",4.3,"Hazy amber hue, tan-colored foamy head, herbal dry spices of fines herbes, like basil, thyme, parseley, rosemary, pale malt and yeasty aroma follows through on a medium-bodied palate with grassy note, herbal character of fines herbes of basil, rosemary, thyme, parseley even hint of pepper, pale malt in a leafy bitterness finish.","montréal, Quebec, CANADA","rederic"
97,"2005-06-07",4.5,"Cedar, leaves, lavender, sage, white pepper and celery in the spicy aroma.  Clear caramel-copper coloured body with a decent and lasting fine-bubbled off-white head that leaves some fair lacing.  Cedar, peppery spiciness and yeasty flavours mingle nicely.  Smooth and creamy texture with a gentle effervesence that caresses the tongue and cheeks.  Truly a unique artisanal beer from a master craftsman.

97,"2005-06-07",4.3,"Sample at the Mondial de la Biere.  Copper-bronze, almost clear, lots of visible carbonation, lasting head and some lace...cedar/birch-bark nose, amazing sharp and full of stingy herbs, lavender and a bit of brown sugar, wow...dry, strong herbal character in the body, twiggy with a velvet-soft mouthfeel, luscious carbonation, just a bit of sugar...really over-the-top, the first thing I thought of was root beer, a dry, alcoholic root beer.  Thats a good thing, and so is this beer.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
97,"2005-06-07",4.1,"Bottle. copper body with small floaties and a medium size head. wow, this is a crazy aroma! Flowers, vegetables, hemp, christmas trees, yeast, and dusty hops are all evident in the aroma...plus about a dozen other things I cant identify. Sharp earthy vegetable flavour. Light carbonation.  This has to be the most interesting beer Ive ever tried. Awesome.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"
97,"2005-06-06",4.4,"Rusty orange. Extremely foamy head, sticking on the glass like theres no end, beautiful lacing capacity. Awesome core pencil shavings yeasty nose. Granite rockiness, overwhelming wood notes. Incredibly complex and jumping at you. Lime and pepper yeasty interplays. It smells like chips, it smells like cedar resin and spruce. Very green aroma, tea like chamomile notes with more spice depth reminiscent of sage and thyme. Very fun to sniff and decorticate, but theres no way you can figure whats in there. Rooty greenish flavours. Mellow chillies, spice blend, cumin and maybe even salt. It is very dry in mouth, campfire like or moreso sawdust like dryness, earthy and highly pleasant, just not as enticing as the fiery aroma. Creamy palate, light carbonation, perhaps not as lively as most Fantôme, but even more original and unique.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

97,"2005-06-06",3.9,"Sample at the Mondiale 2005: Poured an extremely cloudy color ale with big thick head with good retention. Aroma of juniper and rosemary are extremely easy to detect. Taste is a mix between the rosemary and the Belgian yeast with a real farmhouse taste behind it. I really enjoyed this non-conventional beer.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

97,"2005-06-04",3.6,"UPDATED: APR 18, 2007 2005 bottle at the Mondial.  Hazy, copper-amber, muddy, brown.  Lots of yeast suspended.  Head provides lacing.  Beige, somewhat retained, but slowly works its way to a ring.  Aroma is very herbal, bitter, astringent dry, but the yeast flavor and aroma is amazing.  Dry tea.  Flavor is vinegar, herbs, leafy/fuzzy green hops, hemp.  Quite oily on the palate, though not watery.  Not much sweetness, low tingly carbonation.  Very very herbally, wow.

The mouth takes all of wich and adds licorish root, anis, sasparilla, soap and a touch of malt.  Finishes with aquavite.","Yokosuka, JAPAN","Marc"
97,"2003-04-06",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2005 Cheesy, hand-made label is hard to look past; but Im not judging a cover here. Head is thin, but somewhat lasting. Color is amber, which blends - from top to bottom - into a hazy yellow-orange. Interesting nose, with wafts of herbal tea, pumpkin pie and lemon yogurt. First sip made my left eyebrow raise. A couple seconds later my second eyebrow raised. My tongue went for a roller coaster ride for a second there; didnt know if it was fun or I was gonna hurl. Soon realized it was positive. Smooth malts up front, quickly turn into an explosion of spices, many reminiscent of teas Ive had before. Strong lemony citrus exudes throughout, occasionally morphing into tangerine, lime, and back to lemon. Lively carbonation. Fizzy, sugary and soft-drink-like at times. Some sourness. Dryish, spicy finish. What a weird, albeit well-made, fricken beer.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
97,"2003-03-23",4.5,"Dull amber (yeast in suspension, despite careful pouring), with orange-red shine.
Nose is  - GOD WHAT? - cypress? myrrh? incense? - no - it's the smell of bog myrtle in an Irish moor.
Taste: WOOW! This is the taste of kaffir-limes (""wild limes""), if you've ever had the opportunity to taste those, together with bog myrtle, cypress. Yet there is a subterranean sweetness. It's like being in a late autumn garden, next to the cypress plant, wild mushrooms coming up, and in the field next, the winter leeks are being covered, marvellous!
Mouthfeel: oily, slick, but in NO way repulsive.
Aftertaste: what I described as myrrh or cypress, now turns to a resiny flavour: cedar, copalite, Retsina. THAT'S it: this is the Retsina under the beers. Strange (ghost) indeed. I LOVE it. I don't like Retsina. Go figure.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
97,"2002-10-23",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2007 New batch fresh from Shelton (whatever that might mean...late 06 or early 07).
Head is initially small, frothy/fizzy, light brown, mostly diminishing.
Body is hazy medium to dark amber, bottle conditioned. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain, cookie), lightly yeasty (barnyard), with notes of nutmeg, sage, cave earth, moss. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, lightly astringent. The batch I tried at RBSG 2005 was extremely medicinal in the nose, and very strongly aromatic (didnt rate that one, as I didnt have my own glass of it).  This one is fairly mild in the nose, quite a change.  Its still doing most of the malt balance with sourness, as it was many years ago.  Its not very bitter at all this time, in fact.  So...hmm...interesting, but not that great this time.  Aging it will probably not help much.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
97,"2002-09-15",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2005 Antiphlogistine fumes reign over this senile voodoo potion...Muddy green spices (rosemary, mint) and vegetables are plentiful in the cauldron, and the aroma stuns the waking nostrils...The voodoo sorcerer is wearing milky pepper on his ear lobes and forehead and shakes his head over his concoction in order to drop in the right amount...This beer, claims the sorcerer, is for those who are comfortable in their understanding of beer...It will slap them twice and bite their tongue out...Very dry, bitter and frothy, the flavors are a tad less expressive than the marvelous nose, but still present cohesion and inspiration...Need I say that the word ""original"" would be a huge understatement?...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
97,"2002-07-31",3.1,"Not as good as others ive had from Fantome. Malty flavour, sour and acidic, and a gingery spicy flavour, it definitely hides the alcohol, a bit fizzy, but its decent. If you see it, you have to give it a go.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
