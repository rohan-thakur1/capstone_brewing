2085,"2016-06-07",5.0,"750mL growler filled 5/14/6, drunk 6/3/16. Thanks, Nelson!Long conversation about how long Tree House/Trillium/Hill hoppy growlers last precedes the tasting of the beer. Im on the ""completely fine up to three weeks"" line, though I know others may say closer to two.Anyways, that aside, they just go and do it again. God damn you, Tree House. Sometimes the hype is justified and here it is and then some. I usually try to go about my ""beer career"" free from as much hype as possible and I sincerely believe these guys are making the best hoppy beers in the country, better than Hill Farmsteads overall (though maybe the very best HFs may top THs best? not sure).Anyways, this beer is almost too much to believe. How in hell they got that aroma, almost nearly as enveloping and intense as Green, Julius, etc... is beyond me. Lush, lightly juicy, with dank, floral, spicy and soft limes and meyer lemons. Light minerality and only a dusting of cracker/biscuit-like malts (really no malt apparency at all in the nose).And then you take a sip and theres very little bitterness, absolutely no resin and just a wonderfully attenuated, perfectly carbonated, biscuity malted, light blonde ale that is almost too easy to drink. Very light lemon, mango and very soft key lime tickle the palate as the creaminess from the fine carbonation and soft malts continue to delight. No flaw, no alcohol, no resin. Maybe some think its too mild and lightly bland in the flavor, but I think its absolutely perfect and quite a marvel that its so soft, understated and drinkable. Wow. Even more delicate than Trilliums lightest pale ales. I guess we are in Walden territory, but the hops here are even more aromatic. So f-in good.....how do they do this....I feel like not giving this a 5 would be jaded and contrary just for the sake of not giving a perfect score. The best session golden ale Ive had. Would/could drink endless amounts of this stuff.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Bottle: The aroma consists of big citrus, grapefruit, pine, tropical fruits, and a hint of dank hops.

2085,"2015-10-23",4.0,"Growler (1L). Shared by Simon at tasting, thanks! Super hazy, but also super glowing yellow-golden with a medium white head leaving some lacing. Aroma is so intensely orange / orange juice forward, its impressive. Theres also some interesting dank hops, as well as perfumy notes and grass so that isnt unidimensional. Taste is also juicy orange forward (not as much as aroma, but Im not sure what could be) with a rather low bitterness level and grassy notes. Medium body. Soft to moderate carbonation. Juicy mouthfeel. I probably wouldnt drink it on a daily basis, but its a pretty nice experiment to have such a juicy and intense hopping on a super clean and discrete malt backbone.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
