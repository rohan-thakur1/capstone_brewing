Une odeur bien dosé de fruit noire, de pruneaux, de raisin sec et de cerise. Le tout agrémenté de sucre et de caramel. Un arôme bien boisé fondu dans le chocolat et la noisette! Plus la température augmente plus lalcool se fait sentir, mais quau nez. 

Les fruits noirs font leur entré, raisin. pruneau, figue, cerise entremêlé de caramel et de vanille. Des notes levurés apportes des traces sans équivoque, de banane et dépice.

Larrière goût semble être comme le goût de la réglisse rouge! Les épices bien choisi donne un effet assez rond, une finale lente qui perdure dans le fruit noir et un malt caramel saupoudré de cacao.

Cest le très haut de gamme, voir le top du top de la bière Belge, donc de la bière mondiale... Très belle brune avec des reflets pourpres profonds et une mousse fine beige à bulles fines, ultra-stable à quelques millimètres. Nez exceptionnel, soyons clairs. Un côté beurré très présent, liquoreux, alcool puissant, des malts sublimes (chocolat, café, caramel, sirop dérable, cassonade, miel, châtaigne, pain viennois etc.), beaucoup de fruits avec des notes de fraise, pruneau, pêche, abricot, banane, goyave, mangue, raisin, figue, mûre, myrtille, noix, poire, pomme cuite, en veux tu en voilà ! Des épices avec ce côté vanillé et cannelle très prononcé, mais aussi, et cest là quelle se démarque (aussi), un côté boisé très intéressant, comme mûrie longuement en fût de chêne. La levure est droite, longue, ample, un régal. En bouche, lalcool emplit tout lespace tout en laissant sexprimer les arômes, et il y en a une palanqué ! Les 11% ne sont pas là pour faire rire, mais en même temps ils soutiennent parfaitement lensemble, léquilibre est une merveille. On retrouve les notes de liqueur de mirabelle ou de prune... La texture est soyeuse, liquoreuse, presque sirupeuse même, les sucres sont doux, ronds, avec des saveurs de sucre candi, de miel, de sirop de canne ou dagave. Lamertume quant à elle est présente, surtout en début de gorgée tout comme la carbonatation, plutôt correcte pour une bière de ce calibre éthylique. Le final est sur les esters, très huileux, les notes boisées et de cuir, les malts torréfiés et ce sucre enivrant. Le palet est littéralement caressé et en redemande à chaque gorgée ! Même si ce nest pas son fort, on retrouve de la fraicheur, les houblons sont discrets dirons nous, mais ils font le job. Une véritable symphonie gustative, à déguster en écoutant Symbolic de Death, un bon Devin Townsend, la cinquième de Beethoven ou la chevauchée des Walkyries ! Le brassage élevé au rang dart...

2260,"2016-04-23",4.0,"750 ml cork bottle 2014 vintage opened with loud pop bought at Craftissimo in Tsim Sha Tsui East.
Looks: Cloudy hazy deep ruby red colour with a layer of yeast sediments; Three-quarter finger head and light beige foam which last for 1 minute; Beautiful sticky lacing with active small carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and sweet dark malt, with Brandy-like liquor, strong liquorices, strong plums, figs, sugar, spices, bread, strong Bel yeast and lemon.

Taste: Strong sweet dark malt, with strong caramel, light toffee, dark fruits, light red fruits, syrup, light spices, light bread, strong Bel yeast, lemon, light bitter hops and light grass.

Body: Full body. Oily, creamy and very slick palate.

Mouth feel: Solid dark maltyness in a thick and very smooth background. Strong caramel followed by pretty strong dark fruits and touches of red fruits. No apparent boozy taste so common with strong Belgian Dark, amazing! Syrupy sweet but in a nice, slightly nectar-ish manner. Yeasty with moderate lemon to round. Very nice!

Booze: Strong in Brandy-like aroma, the 11.0% alcohol is completely hidden in taste, even liquorices is very light. This is art!

Hoppiness: Spices and lemon in nose. Lemon and light grass in taste. Bitterness is moderately low for a lasting, fairly low astringent sweet malty finish.

After Taste: Slightly dry. Creamy, sweet and light bitter to mouth.

Comments: Compares to hard hitters like Chimay Blue, Piraat, Bush de Noël, etc., this one has the heavy liquor-ish attribute in aroma, yet surprisingly booze-less in taste, makes it very easy to drink if you dig the strong syrupy sweetness. Rather straight forward in taste but taster friendliness is the key. Excellent!

Fills in rapidly with sweet toffee, molasses, stewed fruits and jam. Finish has a bit of bready overtones, more sweet toffee and stewed fruits, a bit mineral and dusty for the weight of the beer. Light bitterness and peppery herbal notes, some cigar box mark a drying finish. A bit of alcohol. Medium bodied with moderate effervescent carb.

2260,"2015-04-18",3.9,"August 7th, 2013 - These days Belgian beers get slotted into my drinking schedule less and less, in favor of the local brewers putting out new and innovative entries on what seems to be a weekly basis. But a return to the old country proves why I should make more trips to the store to take an imaginary trip across the Atlantic. Gouden Carolus Cuvée van de Keizer Blauw is a testament to the brilliant engineering that goes into a well balanced Belgian Strong Ale. The pour gives off a deep, burgundy red beer with a head that barely sits up for the photograph, preferring to recline and settle into the body. The nose gives off deep umami hits of soy sauce and miso paste, with a thick layer of that mouth watering cheese richness, though thinner than most BSAs. A more invokable comparison might be miso dressing, mixed with a bit of artisanal soy sauce and cocoa powder, and even a little dashi for extra warmth and tastiness. On the palate I immediately notice a smooth, velvety texture, which brings with it grape, cheese and yet more umami. The flavor firms and sweetens after it settles, giving off notes of spice and brown sugar, and where there was bordeaux grape in the foretaste, instead theres a space filled more with bakers sweets than the sugars of a farmers market. Though the alcohol is masked, its a sow sipping beer, with a strength behind the curtains. An approach to room temperature brings some pear juice to bear, upping the already remarkable quality of this brew.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Selymes, krémes, bársonyos illatok, mindenféle jelző helyénvalóvá válik az aromák terén is, ami egyébként leginkább a textúrát lenne hivatott jellemezni. Füge, datolya, vörösbor; aszalványok, magvak tejszínes fürdőjének nyalábjai kapaszkodnak össze puha szálaikkal - összetéveszthetetlen belga aromák. Ahogy az lenni szokott a kivételesen minőségi főzetek esetében, az illatok adta körvonalakat mesterien harmonikus módon tölti meg tartalommal az ízjegyek kifinomult játéka; utánozhatatlanul krémes szerkezetben testesülnek meg a mazsolás, aszalt szilvás, gyümölcskenyeres komponensek. Simogató, tejszínes karakter öleli körbe az egyébként igen érett, nemesnek ható szerkezetet, amit a vörösboros, egyszerre túlérett és fanyar gyümölcsös hangulatok elegáns alkoholfátyollal fedett jellege biztosít. Amellett, hogy hibákat nagyítóval sem igen találunk benne, határozottan érlelésért kiált a főzet nagyszabású teste, így aki kellő eltökéltséget érez magában, mindenképpen tegye el egy pár hosszú évre, az eredmény valószínűleg lehengerlő lesz.","HUNGARY","adster"

2260,"2014-09-07",4.4,"Transfer from BA review on 4-6-13-

 Poured from bottle into a chalice glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a chestnut-mahogany color with some red highlights shining through. Upon pouring there is a small tannish colored head that forms on the surface of the brew. The head fades very slowly over time, leaving a great level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is sweet of dark fruits, with a big dose of prune and raisin as well as a small amount of cherry. Mixed with the sweet fruit is a caramel and candied sugar aroma as well. While heaviest in the sweeter aromas there are other nice aromas present as well. An oaky and woody aroma as well as a nutty aroma meld well with the fruit sweet aromas. When all are mixed with a nice boozy rum like smell, a very pleasingly sweet and warming smell is put forth.

 Taste  The taste begins with the big dark fruit aromas detected in the nose. Raisin, prune, cherry and fig all show up big at the start and are mixed with a bit of a roasted malt and vanilla. Some light yeasty notes bring with them a light banana and spice flavor more toward the middle of the taste. Along with the yeasty tastes so too comes a light caramel sweetness as well as a little bit of a woody taste. More toward the end a light booziness, much lighter then what would be expected from the nose, is sensed by the tongue. Overall a nice sweet and robust lightly warming flavor is left to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average to slightly thinner side for a Belgian strong dark of 11% abv with a carbonation level that is on the average side. Both are nice for the sweeter dark fruit flavors of the brew and make this one a little too easy to drink even though it is at 11 % abv.

 Overall  A rather nice Belgian strong dark with a big sweet dark fruit flavor and a nice lighter boozy and yeasty spiced flavor that rounds out the sweet well when mixed with a lighter malty taste. It is overall quite enjoyable.","","Darkmagus82"

Aroma is quick to point out that this is, in fact, something much better. It offers dark, plummy fruitiness, sweet caramel maltiness, a hint of licorice and currant. Taste is extremely long; there is clearly a beginning, a middle part and a finish. It features initially medium sweet maltiness, later some ripe warming notes of currant and plum appear. The finish is very light bitter with some sherry-like flavours. A strong, warming Belgian this is, but no alcohol in the taste. The palate is full, the texture a bit sticky and the mouthfeel really soft.

Actually first whiff of this reminds me of a nice port, fruity with strong wine in the mix, malt bit hidden. Tilting in glass brings bit ash but not much more. Am bit in a flu but at least now I find this very strongly winey and is bit hard even find beer aromas. Well we do have one versatile drink in beer, thats why I like it. Good palate. Soft and round, carbonation is present but it just is very soft, not as sweet as aroma, ash more on front and winey notes also not as much here. This is beer all right. Medium to full body, long tasty finish, alcohol is there but in a nice warming form, very Belgian yeasting, still port here. Quite excellent actually, port beer, great flavors and aromas, lovely color, good palate, enjoyable and unique (at least to me). Recommended.

Re-tasting as warms up and have read what others liked. Lacing is very nice here. Color more mahogany as glass is soon empty. Plums and raisins as pointed before me are there.

Poured on draft at The Trappist into a Gouden Carolus tulip. 

A: Dark, malty notes of brown sugar and caramel with some plum, dark cherry and cola notes.
A: Pours an opaque, deep mahogany with bronze highlights and a finger-width creamy khaki colored head; decent retention, nice walls of lacing. I cannot fathom a better looking beer. 
T: Big, bold taste with spicy yeast up front, followed by fruitiness and sweet malt giving way to a slight crisp bitter taste at the finish, along with more malt. Im a little surprised at the sweetness of this beer. 
P: Medium to full bodied with moderate to high amounts of carbonation. Very creamy.

2260,"2013-10-29",3.9,"Bottled February 4, 2013 (~9 months old).
Appearance: The body is an ugly muddy brown with hints of red through it, the head is tall and dense, like a latte. The head is very persistent, maintaining a dense and creamy figure with a tan hue. Even after multiple sips, the head is still thick and persistent, its a thing of beauty.
Aroma: The aroma is big on fig and mildly medicinal grape with a big malt base behind it, reminding me of brown sugar and toffee and hints of apple. This has good strength and leans sweet.
Taste: Big malts and big fruitiness here. The intro is medicinal grape heavy, which is a prominent flavor throughout along with sweet apple. Underlying that is a big caramel and brown sugar presence and a general malty sweetness. The finish is of fig and a mild lingering brown sugar, sweet and fruity.

Colour is a beautiful deep red ruby one, with one thin line of beige head on top. Low retention and no lacing left on the glass.
Very nice aroma of fortified wine, like a porto or a mavrodaphne. A bit of sugar and spices. Taste is sweet and less wine-y now. Some sugars on the taste and a bit of caramel.
Quite thin body and much less carbonation than what I remember, to the poitn that you could say its watery.
Overall, if you have a bottle that old in your cellar still, open it before its too late. The 2012 was an exceptional beer, this one lacks in everything, the aroma, the taste and much more on the mouthfeel.

750 ml bottle, vintage 2012, at home, all alone. Poured into a tulip glass. ABV 11%.
Great appearance, with a very deep ruby colour on the body, even more beuatiful when the light happes to pass through it. On top of it a two fingers tall head, beige in colour, with good retention and medium lacing left around the glass.
The aroma is to die for! Very wine-y, lots of black grapes, less caramel, sugars, spices. Trully excellent!
Wow, what a taste! Also very wine-like, brings to mind the greek mavrodaphne (or mavrodafni) wines. Alcohol very well hidden, no way I could tell this is 11% if I hadnt see it on the bottle. Again, some sugars, some spices, a little bit of prunes too.
Nice thickness on the body, with the carbonation being as much as it is needed.
Overall this is a great beer, its hard to believe that is so widely available and in a such a low price as well. I would give it a perfect score but I think Ill reserve that for the bottle I have from 2000.","Arnhem, NETHERLANDS","Christos"

The bottle wasn't very appealing and I've never heard of the brewery, so I was a little shaky.... When I opened the cork, it sounded like pearly gates opening! This is an awesome Quad (full palate, lovely aroma, appearance, and superb flavor, I think it's at the top of my list... Note to self- listen to every recommendation she has for you. Thanks!

2260,"2012-12-27",4.4,"Reviewed 12/25/2012. 11.2 oz bottle (2011 vintage) into a Duvel tulip.

A: Pours a hazy dark brown color. The head is a one finger light cream color with nice texturing around the edge of the glass. Retention isnt that good, unfortunately, but lacing is attractive but sparse.

S: Theres a strong aromatic bouquet of raspberries and chocolate, with underlying notes of cream, crisp pears, toffee, brown sugar, honey, and lavender. I really love inhaling this beer, theres so much here to take in and enjoy.

T: Sweetness explodes on the tongue right from the get go - chocolate and malted milk balls dominate the palate initially. It sounds like this will be hella sweet. Luckily, this features the hallmark of most great BSDAs, that being impressive balance to help tie together the great flavors. Some earthy, flowery hops will try to nudge into the flavor profile midway through, while the finish is (balanced) alcohol, honey and tart dark fruits. The complexity is something you can really chew through and analyze while remaining a delicate, subtle suggestion.

M: As a nitpick, this beer sits a bit too heavily on the palate. Otherwise, its a silky smooth beer thats clean as a sheet, but with a great residual aftertaste. A little boozy, but nowhere near harsh on the palate. Not quite as carbonated as it seems initially - but maybe thats because I let it rest for about 15 minutes.

O: Wonderfully crafted yet immensely enjoyable. Right up there in the same conversation as Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus 12 in my mind.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Demerara sugar and raisins also came to mind in this fairly sweet yet very drinkable brew. The alcohol is detectable but it adds to the enjoyment rather than hindering as some weaker/watery beers often suffer with because their flavours are not strong enough: these flavours certainly are hefty enough to take the alcohol and help it to enhance the brew.

The aroma is delectable, with scents of sweet malt, Belgian yeast, and dark fruits.

The flavor brings more of the same, with an awesome bouquet of Belgian yeast and dark fruit. The beer is still a bit sweet, and could easily sit in the cellar for a few more years.

The syrupy mouthfeeled brew finishes vinous and warming escorted by citrusses and spices, which leaves a long tart aftertaste behind.
Delicious and noble one for special occasions.","Budapest, HUNGARY","inbirraveritas"
2260,"2012-07-16",3.8,"750ml 2005 bottle, bought in Belgium. Hazy and very dark mahogany with a creamy dark cream head that fades slightly to a film. Light port and tanin notes, caramelized figs, prunes, some brown sugar.

2260,"2012-07-14",5.0,"Une bière réellement extraordinaire.... (Cuvée 2011)
Dabord sa création est strictement circonstancielle, cest-à-dire lanniversaire de
Charles-Quint, excusez du peu....
Ensuite tout dans cette bière est conçu pour être un élément de fête.
La couleur est superbe, dun noir très profond.
La clarté nest interprétable quen transparence, mais elle est limpide.
Les bulles sont généreuses et réparties dans tout le verre.
La mousse beige nappe le liquide pour le protéger des intrusions intempestives...
Les arômes sont dune complexité très belle : céréales, bois et fruits mûrs.
Le volume est dun soyeux sublime.
Lentrée en matière est superbe, dune générosité incroyable dans le goût.
La rondeur est sublime.
Le second goût révèle un grand ensemble fût de grand vin et malt caramélisé.
La 3ème bouche est un équilibre merveilleux de vérité. Elle allie la douceur dun
Yquem à la profondeur dun brassin de trappiste...
La longueur est extraordinaire.
La levure est digne des plus grandes créations.
La finale est prodigieuse, grandiose.
Lalcool est la structure de lédifice, un vrai programme : fort et chaleureux.
(Nous trouvons à laffiche 11 % abv, ce nest pas rien...)
En conclusion, nous sommes ici en présence dune bière fabuleuse.
Coter cette bière en dessous de 4,8 nécessite de réviser ses critères de

2260,"2011-04-09",4.4,"2009 bottle: I smell gently sweet fruit, cola notes and alcohol (damn allergies). Its mahogany brown with almost a lavender tint, and dense, lush tan foam on top. Its a nutty, sweet, syrupy mouthful of ale. Some toasted pecan-ish bitterness follows the ultra smooth biscuity, near chocolate cake flavors. Noticeable alcohol but not overwhelming considering its 11%.  Im sure this sounds all over the place, I do have some sinus issues at present, but its so complex, yet mellow. Like a chocolate cake with a brandied cherry sauce?? Wonderful and balanced, artisanal without a doubt. I say drink, contemplate, and notice some subtleties.","Nompton, Oklahoma, USA","swanmann"

En bouche, le liquide a une structure forte, bien charpenté, ronde à souhait, expansive.  Son effervescence me semble parfaite, maîtrisée, capable de fouetter la grande suavité de son corps.

2260,"2011-01-18",3.7,"2008 vintage. Poured into a snifter. Big thanks to spimptastikx for this one.

4.0 A: Clear dark amber brown color. One and a half fingers of frothy light tan head with average retention and some spotty lacing.

4.5 S: Very nice. Dark fruits with a lot of plum. Sugary cake icing. Light to moderate booziness. Touch of raisin and touch of tobacco. Peppery spiciness.

4.0 T: A ton of peppery spiciness. Way more than in the nose. Raisin and tobacco are also more prominent while the plum is less so. Moderate to high booziness this time, which is okay for 11% ABV, but not ideal.

3.5 M: Lighter medium body. This is the first time Ive ever thought this for a Belgian brew, but Id say theres too much carbonation. Im producing some formidable belches. Otherwise, the carbonation is spritzy. Boozy throughout and a little extra on the finish.

3.5 D: Good brew, but the carbonation is too high and the brew itself is a bit too boozy for this to be very drinkable. I bet this ages well.

Dark copper with hints of vermilion at the edges. Head is wonderfully creamy and full, an off-white with reddish-brown hues. This is one heck of a head; it feels great on the lips, but holds softly and fully at one finger in size.

Initial metallic aromas. I cant quite put my nose on it, but I do catch dark fruit and tobacco. Some spice.
The second pour barks orchard fruit ... is that apricot? candied peaches? an alcohol-infused fresh fruit syrup? Definite cherry. Whoa. I am very impressed with the nose as this warms. 

Alcoholic finish. Smooth. Raisins. Cherries. Dried lingonberries. Plums. Orange. Caramel malts. Sugar and spice. Sugar, then spice. 

Mouthcoating. Have I said creamy? Medium-full with good carbonation. 

A great sipper or sharer. Only drawback - for some - might be the unmasked alcohol. Perhaps not for the faint of heart, but Cuvee Van De Keizer is no feint, nevertheless. This is one solid, beautiful BDSA.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"

Holding her gilded depths up to the light, she is a precious jewel that would be right at home adorning the crown of some noble person. Her head fades into a gentle blanket, and no sooner do I lift her burgundy depths up to my hopefully worthy nose does time stop and beervana descend. Belgium, you have done it again; once more I am your willing disciple of beery humility. Vinous, sour, grapey, plumy, and marked by a wisp of banana cream followed immediately by blueberries and cream atop a generous bowl of homemade vanilla bean ice cream. Her nose exudes creamy berry delights which finish with crisp green apples and pears right off the tree. Rounding the corner, I come right back to more grapes with concord taking center stage while wood and ruby port soften the edges. Are those flower petals I smell? Lilac maybe? I cant take it anymore; smelling is all well and good and she has been very good, but I desire more. Lips meet and goose bumps immediately trace their way from the tippy-top of my head to the tippy-top of my pinkie toe. Vinous, tart, sour, woody, and whoa! Tartness tickles all the way to the back of my throat, grazing the sides of my cheeks along the way. Concord grapes and plums are the first to shine while her creamy mouthfeel revels in banana cream, just a dab please, before her dark berries and ruby port take over. Red licorice streaks on by, and I fall into an ocean of more plums and concord grapes making merry with baby red peaches, pears, apples, cherries with pits, and blackberries. Add some wood to the mix and I am in port heaven while lil Bretty bugs add tart and funk to her berryliciousness. Yes, that is a word because I say so; deal with it.

2260,"2010-10-22",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 27, 2016 [10/10] 2009 bottle, 13C. Pours dark brown with a beige coat. Plum, licorice and toffee aroma with fresh figs, orange zest, earthy yeast, cinnamon. Full mouthfeel is only very slightly syrupy, aided by light carbonation. Taste has loads of fruity - as above, perhaps with cherries too - sweetness with some dark sugars. Tidy bitterness leads to finish thats getting towards dry. Some nutty sherry-like notes. Rather elegant. Alcohol is not all that obvious for 11%. Not a brooding beer - its open and full of ripe fruit. The sweetness grew a little too much as it warmed and Im happy I drank it whilst theres some overt bitterness. Better with nuts than cheese FWIW. [3.9][3/13] 2012 bottle. Ivory with a lasting beige coat. Very fruity, earth and leather. Figs, raisins, licorice. Very sweet, alcohol sticks out a bit.

2260,"2010-08-07",4.9,"Bottle.

A - Very dark plum color with some dark ruby hues on the edge. Fairly large, creamy, sticky, toasted marshmallow colored head. Decent retention and a beautiful layer of creamy, sticky lace.

S - Plenty of dark fruit consisting of plum, raisin, and date. Nice sweetness as well with molasses, dark candi sugar, licorice/anise, and a touch of bubblegum. Well spiced with clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a touch of coriander. Hints of rum/brandy soaked fruit as well. Some dark malt and a touch of breadiness make the base. Pretty complex aroma.

T  Good mix of dark fruit, spice, and sweet bread flavors throughout the sip. Similar to the nose. Starts with a strong dark, spiced fruit at first. Mid sip has a strong licorice and bubble gum flavor come out. The dark fruit then comes on strong at the end with a bit more of a rum/brandy flavor to it. The sweet bready flavor is a nice persistent undertone throughout the sip.

M - Medium, maybe slightly toward full, body. Has a lush, creamy, persistent kind of feel to it though. Good amount of carbonation.

D - Well balanced and complex beer with a great mix of flavors that had me wanting to drink more. I could see it potentially being a little too sweet/cloying, but I like sweeter beers on occasion and I think it works for the style.

Notes: Vintage 2009. Great beer that is very complex and has a lot of bold, big flavors. Inclusion of licorice and bubblegum flavor is interesting for the style. I really liked the beer, like I said before, some may think it is a bit too sweet, but it makes a great dessert or night caper (although I could see me drinking this other times too!).","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Some alcohol in the undercurrents of the entire flavor. The body is a very full creation, with lingering brown sugar notes and lots of classic Belgian dried fruits as main elements.

The taste is sweet, very brown sugar like, and the yeast comes in and sort of seems like it plays a role in trying to balance out the sweetness.

2260,"2010-02-09",4.4,"Ok yeah this beer pretty much kicks ass.  So thanks to BierBauch for this one.  There are alot of qualities of this beer that are reminiscent of St. Bernardus Abt12 but also a ton of uniqueness in here as well.  Aroma is similar to Bernardus with the heavy hit of yeast and bread dough but also sweeter as it has a more robust dark fruit characteristic.  The aroma filled the room as soon as I started to pour it.    Flavor is unique while at the same time keeping some of the great qualities of other favorite Belgians.  Theres definitely more chocolate in the mix, along with large supply of dark fruits such as plums and figs.  There are some hops as well that add a nice balanced bitterness.  The palate is twice as heavy as I was expecting.  Quite thick and syrupy but still remains soft and just plain fun to drink.  A real treat.

2260,"2010-01-01",4.2,"2009 labeled, corked, 75 cl Bottle. Pours Dark mahogany with ruby highlight. Tiny fingerwide tanned head shows quite cohesive lacing with confident retention. Moderate fruity esters on the nose - a bit similar to GC classic. Not so dried fruity, a bit woody with plums, and dark grapes and then a some dark roasted, but sweetish chocolate and rum like (phenolic?), spicy interplay. The first sip leaves a very sweet, dark cherry kind of yeasty, malty fullness on the tounge. Definitely a sipper, but only a very subtle alcohol warmth is sensible. Big bombs of dark cherry and raisin-like esters, caramelized sugars, interesting peppery, yeasty notes smoothly surfacing in your palate and seating there for a long, holy time. :) Some chewy, crisp, but peppery belgian hops are maybe present but not dry or bitter at all. It would be interesting to try an older vintage how would improve the fruity character, and howd mellow the alcohol. Very solid beer, still at this fresh vintage.

Mouthfeel is very smooth  one of the best, most surprising features of this beer, actually.   No metallic flavor, alcohol is very well hidden, no astringency.

Aroma is malty, yeasty, candied, very belgian if that makes any sense.  Now that the head is at a managable level, a sip: I can see why this one has a pretty good reputation.  Dark fruit, light rasin, a little banana bread.  While the flavor isnt typically what I look for, I can step back from my own bias and see that this is a good mix and it is done well.

Only a subtle ""poof"" as the cork comes off. Dont fret, as theres ample carbonation from the deep bourbon barrel-colored body rising to a 2-finger, ginger-colored bready head that is thick, dense and lumpy. Awesome.

Beautiful scent of apple and pear esters are first wave. With warmth, more banana, yeast and malt emerge. Bountiful and beautiful.

Silky, sweet, thick malt presence with well-balanced esters of banana, pear and apple. Carbonation blends in Beautiful Chemistry with yeast, copious amounts of malt and mild ginger, clove and cinnamon. Malt and spice emerge even more profoundly with warmth.

Poured out a deep brown with red hues, small quickly dying tan head with zero retention - maybe a more aggressive pour should have been done? The aroma of sweet spice and caramel hits you quickly, sweet raisin, weak wood, hints of alcohol, faint cinnamon candy, licorice - reminds me of an eisbock. The taste is spicy but very easy drinking, allspice, clove, some alcohol, the spice really comes out as this warms and the caramel character tries to tame it but cannot.

Pours a very dark, almost crimson-burgundy kind of colour, very unexpected but nice (gee I thought it would be blue!). Small head for a BSA. Aroma: Very nice, very different from what I expected, loads of fruit esters, cherry, apple, prune, date, purple drink (artificial grape; see Dave Chappelle). An odd mix that actually almost reminds me of Rochefort 10. Boozy but in a more inviting way than cloying. Quite sweet. Flavour is more of the same, but it comes in delicious waves, almost one at a time. A very sweet brew, the lack of yeast is noticable and the malts are left to really run the show. Nice fuller mouth-feel and the alcohol presence makes me believe the 11% claim despite the 9.9% labeling by the LCBO (theyre always such party-poopers about this sort of thing). Quite an impressive brew, not something Id call chuggable, nor would I wish to funnel it, which is a shame because this is something I tend to look for in my Belgian Strong Ales (Wait, what?). And the bottle is pretty sweet-looking too!  If I were the Belgian Emperor Id probably drink this for breakfast, or in shots off my Empress sweet-ass body.

Flavour is very sweet, malts, dark fruits, alcohol, prickly alcoholic finish. Just like other GC dark beers this one is very sweet, but the mouthfeel is so soft and creamy it doesnt become cloying.

Taste is a little rusty and metallic with an odd array of flavors in conflict: Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, caramel, brown sugar, rum raisin, black cherries, and bourbon. Could be bourbon-barrel aged. Dry, cardboard aftertaste. Perhaps this needs a bit more aging, but regardless I think that the Noel version is an infinitely better ale.

2260,"2009-02-25",4.3,"2005 vintage that was saved to be shared with a dear friend of mine. Kinda exciting to taste a beer brewed 4 years ago to the day! 
It poured a deep dark brown with a small head retention. Aromas of raisins and molasses. On the palate, a very syrupy mouthfeel where the notes of raisins are still here mixed in with molasses and touches of toffee. As it warms up, notes of cherries and chocolate surface. Very warming and sweet finish. Alcohol is very noticeable - more so than when released.

It is quite interesting to taste a beer that is supposed to be able to age for up to 10 years. Later, I would assume that the alcohol would taper off and this beer would become more and more syrupy, inching closer and closer to an old ale or port.

2260,"2009-01-18",3.4,"Huh, Im actually a little surprised to see this beer rated so highly on this site.  I thought it to be good, but not exceptional.  Part of that opinion is no doubt due to my flavor prejudices where I value hoppiness, sourness, and roastiness; predilections no doubt shared by many members of this site (an opinion backed by the majority of beers in the top-100).  This beer doesnt really have those flavors, yet here it is.  

Appearance is brown, cloudy, and a little on the flat side (little head).  Aroma is very malty:  my schnoz detected caramel, spice, wine-like notes, and a certain booziness.  There was also a sugary sweetness in the smell.  Flavor was also caramel-y and spicey (and boozy), but that sugary sweetness in the nose became a butterscotch taste in the mouth.  I also got some floral tastes.  Well, Ill give it this - it is complex (theres a lot in there to enjoy).  Mouthfeel wasnt flat (as I remember it).

I would recommend this beer.  SurlySober brought this over to my house for a tasting with Flyer.  We had Beatification, Allagash Black, Westvleteren 8 and Westvleteren 12 before this beer, so maybe it was just upstaged and I might have thought it exceptional on any other night.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

Did a vertical tasting of all cuvée van de keizers. Had a very amazing experience. First 2008 still missing some body. The 2007 version was a little sour. And then came 2006. We had frm every year 12 bottles in a box. They stayed together in same conditions and then we could taste it. My bottle was very nice and good ballanced. Then asking an other table and asking them what they think of the beer and they told me it tasted as cardboard. I tasted also from that bottle and I agreeded. Then I asked a 3rd table. And their beer had a more sour taste. And I agreed. Then we went down to 2004 till we had a food break. After that break we went further down till the first 1999 brew.

2260,"2008-08-22",4.3,"Vintage 2007.  An imposing wooden red mahogany hue with a frothy cap of beige.  Sweet, decadent and vinous nose of butterscotch, chocolate, raisins, and figs in the first breath, which is a mite too buttery.  But the depth of nuance in the bitter tones and the sweet ones is unknowable; a westvleteren-like unconquerable cave.  Peppery red wine, caramel, raw cocoa nibs, tannins, cinnamon.  For the most part, the dryness of alcohol it offers is in the vein of a fine cabernet, as it seems so dark and tannic, and buried deep in that mysterious pure-chocolate soil.  The butterscotch sweetness at the beginning is a cumbersome gateway into the ocean of character here for me.

Enormously full flavor; a fully realized, deep malt and yeast collaboration at every turn.  Wildflower honey-dipped hazelnuts.  An arresting red wine with every warming caress and velvety nuance it offers; cinnamon, sweet red peppers, brown sugar, and powdery cocoa.  There’s an ebullient brightness of citrus that blends sunshine with the tartness of the wine character into something undeniably attractive.  A fulsome thickness of chocolate, blackberries, caramelized pears and alcohol nearing the finish; warm and expansive, but dusted starkly with a surprising herbal bitterness, that couldn’t be better placed to balance the delirious sweetness and complexity altogether, and to wrap it up on a succinct dry kick.  Wow.

Full palate, syrupy and effervescent, with a wholly erudite impression of cleanness and complexity from start to finish.  It calms down a bit into maple syrup at the very end, showing a touch of alcohol, generously and appropriately.

Some banana esters mixed with dark dried fruits and  a hint of molasses.  The mouth feel was unsurpassed.  At 10% it was sort of sneaky and seductive.

2260,"2008-06-06",4.2,"07 bottle.  Pours a deep ruby red, a bit of brown and a modest tan head that fades surprisingly quickly for a Belgian.  Nose is heavy on the dark fruits, sweetness and is oh-so-fitting for dessert.  Smells of banana nut bread, hazelnut coffee, molasses, brown sugar, cherries, slightly leafy, and a wee bit of alcohol.  Sweet molasses taste initially gives way to hazelnut, toast, more banana nut bread (but milder), cherries, and a bit sugar coated Christmas bread flavor.  Finish emphasizes the subtle coffee and earth notes, dries out a little, and the fruit disappears, leaving only the most pleasant earthy sweet coffee/cake aftertaste.  Delicious!  Reminds me of PannepØt a little bit, but with more fruit.  The only problem is the disappearing head and that the palate seems a bit shallow and uncreamy, despite being viscous enough.

Bottle. 2000 vintage bought at Alvinne brewery shop for about 6.5 Euro (!). 8.5% ABV according to the label. Dark brown color with deep red hues and a small to medium, quickly-diminishing, beige head. Sweet sugary-caramelly malt aroma with some berries and some plum notes. Very sweet flavor with big maltiness, brown sugar, loads of dark fruits and a sweet finish with a bit of yeast and spiciness and some alcoholic notes. Medium body which feels too light to handle the strong maltiness. This is too sugary (gets even a bit cloying) for me. This beer is still ok but Im actually quite disappointed.","Tel Aviv, ISRAEL","DSG"
2260,"2008-05-11",4.3,"How about his one?  A bottle from 2000....yeah you read that right...2000!  This happens to be my favorite beer as I have had previously 2006 and 2007.  I didnt do a vertical, but that event is in the works!  Anyway, the aroma from the bottle just after release of the stubborn cork was overwhelmingly of dark fruit and sugar.  It pours a dark-brown coppery color with a smallish head that seemed to dissipate quickly.  Maybe some of the carbonation has worn off over the years.  The aroma, once poured, was of dark raisins, plums, candy sugar, and carmel.  Now for a sip...the flavor matches the aroma quite well.  You get a potpouri of dark fruits such as plum and dark cherry.  It almost has the fruitiness of a quality dark champagne!  Great mouthfeel with a smoothness that I dont remember being present in the more recent vintages.  It also seems sweeter than those vintages.  There is also, almost no trace of alcohol taste in the finish.  Outstanding!","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ahalloin"

2260,"2008-04-26",3.9,"A- Pours a deep, dark reddish hue with a nice little eggshell white head which stays on top of this brew for quite a while.

S- Smell is dominated by a sweet banana character which kind of dominates the nose but lying behind it are spices and a yeasty distinctly belgian character to it.

T- Taste is super sweet at the begining, dark yet fruity sustained by a deep malt breadiness which leads into an alcohol warming. The alcohol is covered up masterfully. Not my usual beer but it is making me reconsider the Belgian Strong Dark Ale Style.

M- Thick and creamy with a just the right amount of carbonation bite at the end.

D- I really wanted to not like this beer. I often find myself not liking a lot of Belgian beers unless they are done really well ... and this one is.

The nose shows copious amounts of dark fruit, primarily fig, raison, and prune.  Sweetness just flows from this thing, with the alcohol soaked fruits being accompanied by dark caramel and some brown sugar.  An indiscernible dark spiciness is present as well.  Flavors are very similar, with huge, sweet dark fruits and sweet caramel making for a heavy, sugary, dessert-like drink.  Thick and syrupy, the body goes down smooth enough but sits heavy in the stomach.

Tastes nicely sweet with sugar, caramel, fig, apricot, and butterscotch. Feels like a delicous dessert with alcohol warming throughout. Medium to thick on the tongue. Nice carbonation finishes this tasty brew. If you want a trappist like beverage this dark beauty is a winner. Could have another but I would be drinking my dinner.

2260,"2007-12-28",4.4,"Bottled 2004. Pours a deep red bordering mahogany with tan, airy head. Particles are suspended all throughout the beer and never settle (or move for that matter)! Aromas of sweet candied cherries, vanilla, and a ton more fruit esters. As it warms the nose develops into a more banana, spicy yeast, port barrels, and raisin. Flavor is of cherries , with notes of raisin, port, cardamom, candy sugar, with a peppery banana finish. Great carbonation left over, but much flatter than new. Finish is quite refreshing and dry with a touch of citrus but still has a definite alcohol warmth. Lips and gums are left sticky with vanilla and cherry.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","TopherDrinks"
2260,"2007-12-27",4.0,"750ml bottle. 2007. Very pleasantly surprised. Plenty of fruity yeast esters on the nose. Banana nut bread comes first to mind. Cherries, wood (cedar?), maple syrup, raisins. Theres just a bit too much fusel alcohol on the nose for it to rate a 9, but I wonder if time will temper that. Pours a rich burgundian shade of brown with a creamy off white head. Maple syrup, raisins, sweet cherry, wood, brown sugar and lots of yeast on the palate. Full bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. Finishes with a tad too much alcohol hotness.

Candi sweet, estery nose full of candied cherries, banana  wood and vanilla with port-like notes and plenty of spice. The flavour is fruity and syrupy sweet with cherries, fig, port, citrus, dried fruits, cardamom , brown sugar and wood. The port flavour in the brew is the most prominent characteristic of the taste. The alcohol presence is very subdued. Finishing, a sticky cherry, vanilla flavour is left on the lips and the aftertaste has great duration. The velvety texture and soft, yet tingly carbonation makes for a perfect palate for this GC.

2260,"2007-12-17",3.7,"750ml Bottle dated 2007, label isted 10% alc., pours dark brown into a chalice or tulip, initially a off-white and tan head that thins to a ring but always 
remains, aromas of yeast, dark and toasted malt, dark fruit, brown sugar, fragrances of bread, zuchini bread, faint licorice and 
sweet raisins, flavor of dark malt, dark candy sweet and bread flavors, fig flavor - reminds me of eating fig newtons as a kid, 
pepper bite at the finish with alcohol warmth, there is a taste of alcohol in the mouth at first sip even when cold,  
the alcohol grows as the ale warms, if you like sweet tasting sipping ales you will enjoy this, medium or more mouth feel.
Gouden Carolus would make a great dessert sipping ale on a cold evening, maybe aging would remove the sweetness because it is 
sweet and this gets old on my palate quickly, I may age a bottle to see how changes, for my taste this ale would be better if it was aged and some of the sweetness was replaced with flavor.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

Flavor continues to be pretty sweet with the raisins, figs, brown sugar, vanilla beans, and some milk chocolate.  Some overripe bananas and light pear (which I dont usually pick up on) are there to add to the fruitiness.

Very full bodied, there are lot of things in there, fruitiness, chocolate, caramel, coffee a bit...everything in a nice order, really a masterpiece. Like a real meal, as we have been kidding.

Lacing is sticky, slow, and falls in blotchy, thick ribbons, with swift but respectable sub-surfacing reverse-lacing.  The head retains very well for the style in a thin wafer.  Aroma is very strongly reminiscent of bananas foster, with caramel sauce and lots of rotten banana fermentation character, slight hints of black pepper, some warming alcohol (even in the nose), and other assorted dark fruits (dates, mostly, but some raisins too), all outlined by a slight toasty presence.  But this is like toast that is very slowly browned (not burnt at all), then saturated with a fresh, deep brown honey to serve.  Delicious.  Flavor follows to fit that same mold-- caramel/rotten banana, some spice hints, a touch of cherry-like acidity (though no cherry fruitiness), and an earthy leather.  Finish adds a very light bitterness which, when paired with the leather, makes for a nicely drying and gently massaging combo.  Theres even a vague lime note to the acidity that helps with the balance.  Body is medium-full, with just enough creamy carbonation to offset the sugary sweetness and soften the alcohol point.  I do get a slight solventy note with the alcohol, humming in the retronasal like a super-smooth whiskey.  Not an offensive alcohol presence in the slightest (but its worth noting that, despite the Commercial Description here on RateBeer, my 04 bottle said ""Alc. 10% Vol.""-- whatever).  Slight baked pear flavor in the finish.  The beer is extremely sweet, for sure, but Ive never shied away from that; the balance is fantastic with hints of dry leather and a quick lick of alcohol to scrub the syrup from off your tongue.  The toast and dark honey/banana flavors linger forever.  Probably the best $9.39 I ever spent and left sitting in the beer fridge for 18 months.  When I open my own dreampub, Ill be sure to have cases of this ""on reserve"" all the time-- only to be offered after theyre at least two years in the cellar.  Heres to aspidites for the jazz recommendation-- Chick Corea was a perfect pairing.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

Maroon berry fruit flavors with dark cherry, some molasses, candied dates, and fresh figs.

2260,"2007-07-25",3.7,"Pours a nice tan rocky head and exudes a caramel and dark raisin, plum aroma.  Great aroma, but I get a little carbonation up my nose when I inhale too deeply. Actually, tonight, i have found that problem in all of the large brews; whether that means that the beers should be aged much longer and allowed to lose some modicum of carbonation, or whether that is how they are supposed to be drunk, I am not sure.  I do know that it slightly detracts from the beer.  Otherwise, I think this is a super-sweet, fruity, not overly complex, but good beer.  
Very palatable and decent.  I am glad I tried it, but this would be something I would age for about 10 years to get some of that oxidized flavor and hope that the sweetness levels out into more balance.  
Next to westy 12, 8, Bernardus 12 and the 60th anniv. Bernardus, this is above average for the style, but pales in comparison.  Not a fair rating in terms of what it is drunk next to, but overall I believe this to be a fair interpretation of a decent beer.","Kirkwood, Missouri, USA","xmarcnolanx"

2260,"2007-07-05",4.0,"Vintage 2000
6/21/2007:  When poured, Grand Cru of the Emperor (2000) looks brown and thick with lots of suspended floaties (probably from the yeast cake on the bottle of the bottle).  It has a thin beige crown on top.  A complex aroma of creamy vanilla, raisin, oak/cork, and alcohol foreshadow a very tasty beer to come...  The flavor does not disappoint.  There is some oxidation, but it works to enhance the other flavors which include rich, sweet malts, vanilla, aged dark fruits, and some wet woodiness.  The alcohol is also noticeable in the flavor, but it too is complementary to the other flavors.  The medium body of this beer has a smooth and creamy texture and is clean on the palate.  This beer has aged beautifully and is a special treat that I really enjoyed.

Vintage 2006
6/21/2007:  Grand Cru of the Emperor (2006) pours clear, is mahagony brown in color, and has a small off-white head.  This beer smells sweet and has a deep fruitiness and caramelized maltiness in the aroma.  It reminds me very much of a Scotch Ale.  The flavor is very similar and quite good.  It has rich, sweet caramel and a light spice on the backend.  It too has a medium body and is quite smooth on the palate.  I really enjoyed this vintage as well, but I think that the 2000 is better due to the complexities and oxidation it has acquired from aging.  Regardless, Grand Cru of the Emperor is an excellent beer young as well!

Smell; tons of dark fruits with plums, dates, raisins and surprisingly a hint of oranges. Theres also a solid malt presence with toffee, brown sugar, with a little bit of bread dough. Add in a little bit of an alcohol presence, and this reminds me a little bit of my grandmothers fruit cake. Very nice.

Taste; very fruity up front with dates, plums, raisins and as with the nose theres a little bit of citrus in there as well. Toffee, brown sugar and molasses give this a very sweet almost sugary profile, and has a significant alcohol presence. This is very good, but would be even better if it were not quite so sweet.

A big up front sweetness followed by a mild hop bitterness that leaves an oaky aftertaste as though you are sucking on a fine piece of furniture.

The nose is sweet and reeks of plum, apple and impending dryness. Interesting, to say the least. The first couple sips were overbearing, to say the least. Once I adjusted, strong flavors of plum remained, but carrying along flavors of mollasses and brown sugar. Maybe some dark cherry? Wallop! The bannana description comes up short for moi, but coriander and a spicey, dry finish wrap this belgian so nicely for me. Definitely have a couple in the cellar for a couple of years.

Strong spices, licorice, anise seed, and more that I really dont know enough about.  Just a hint of smoke as well.  Beneath that a great chocolate and cocoa mix.  Man its original especially for a Belgian brew. Really this tastes like a suped up version of Ancher OSA 2005 or I guess thats a light version of this.  Taste flip flops a bit where the sweet chocolate plays the dominant role and the strong spice is right behind that.  The body is just a bit on the thin side for me. Leaves a light spice aftertaste.

A 2002 vintage corked bottle that I shared with great friends. Poured a slightly hazy chestnut brown with a wispy head. The aroma was quite light, with subtle brandy/caramel notes. It somehow doesnt do justice to what comes next. A sip reveals a deliciously balanced sweetness of figs, melted brown sugar and nutmeg. The five years in the bottle have softened out any bitterness, imparting a feather-light mouthfeel.
This beer was right for so many reasons. It converted a table of non-beer drinkers to the possibilities of great beer, and for me it was the highlight of a great beer year.

2260,"2006-12-25",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 27, 2014 Two years old
2004 bottled tasted Christmas Eve 2006.
The cork comes out with an explosive pop, and the beer pours beautifully - rich caramel brown with a yellow-tan head and splendid lacing.

The aroma offers rich dark caramel, dried fruit, and some apple, but the flavor is where the heart of this one lies. Rich creme brule sweetness erupts throughout the early flavor profile, mingling deeply with prunes and dates, a hint of rum, yet more rich caramel, spicy into the finish - splendid. At almost three years of age, the flavors had melded together beautifully and deeply, scarcely hoppiness remained, and the mouthfeel was just full and luscious without anything like 11% worth of heat.

I was very impressed and enjoy this one immensely. This is a great choice for a sweet dark belgian strong ale.

Six to seven years old. 2002 sampled Thanksgiving 2009.I didnt realize this was 3% lower ABV than the 2004 when I had it. While sweet and delicious it didnt live up to my memories. I thought it was definitely on the downslide, it came off thin and fading. Still the shell of a great beer and maybe given the 3% lower ABV this was not as far past the peak as I first thought.
2006 sampled Thanksgiving 2013 This is listed at 11%. Rich and sweet, dates and spiced rum, lots going on, perfect carbonation, no hint of the alcohol. Delicious. My previous 4.1 seems a good score for this one. 
2008 sampled Thanksgiving 2014 As above; delightful. 4.1 seems low if anything.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2260,"2006-12-21",4.3,"2004 vintage.  Poured a hazy dark ruby with a creamy light tan head.  Leaves perfectly symmetric lacing.  Aroma of cinnamon, cream, raisins, a bit or orange.  Flavor is somewhat dry with flavors of brown sugar, raisins, wheat bread, a bit of wood, slowly fading to a slight bit of acidity that comes with a bit of abbrasive carbonation.  At first, I thought the acidity might reflect some infection, but upon deeper reflection in the flavor it feels quite intentional, as it works to an equilibrium with the sweetness and the dryness.  All in all, everything here is very delicately balanced, and in the end nothing overpowers anything else.  A superbly crafted Belgian that reflects some of the greatest the world has to offer.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

Sits without moving as it barely reduces itself to take on a thicker, cake batter appearance as the fluffyness dissolves into the foam. Lacing coats the glass in thick moth-holed sheeting all the while that cap hardly diminishes.

Aroma is of old, soggy, sugared banana bread thats dark, deep, and dull with slight plum, raisin, fig, and molasses soaking within the deepness. Quite deceptive on the nose as it seems to build while it sits and gets fairly deep and complexly so in that deepness. Nice little noting of spicy orange zest, cinnamon, and cardamom is evident as well.

Oh, my what incredible soaking smoothness and softness this stuff creates as it floats across the palate with amazing ease. Mild, dull flavors of dark fruit bread sink in with raisin, plum, dry fig, molasses, and soft citrusy orange notes that tender up a warming sense of spicyness with cardamom, cooked sugar, and raisin skins making for a lengthy finish. Middle has a creamy center of caramel, banana, and dark sugary sweetness. Its ever changing in its profile, sometimes more warming and spicy, other times, super tender and malty with dark dull sugary stuff. Wonderful play on the palate and on the mind.

Feel is perfect. Soft, supple, giving, full, smooth, warming, sweet, a little bit spicy, and a whole lot of yum! Amazingly soft texture of sugared bread thats soaked in dark fruityness. Theres even a slight hoppy, vitamin coated, citrus bittering that comes across within certain sips thats very intriguing.

Anyway, pours an appealing burnt caramel reddish brown, with a quick 2 finger tan head, medium bubbles, that fades rather quickly. Curiously the beer left heavy lacing in the bottle, but not in my glass (hope it wasnt a clean glass problem). Highly appealing rich aroma: figgy, raisins, plums, some sherry, some indistinct spice that hints at cinnamon or clove, and a rummy alcoholic note. Flavor is full, strong and sweet, with alot of dark fruit (dates, plums) and sweet burnt sugar, borderline cloying but within the range of balance. Still, I could easily see 5 years on this beer putting into the realm of stellar. I will definitely have to cellar one. Mouthfeel is soft, with a surprisingly low carbonation, consistent with its fast fading head. Alcohol is present, but not terribly so.

Although great care was exercised in not shaking the bottle during the uncaging and uncorking ceremony, I still found a gusher in my hand that lost about an ounce of liquid on the desktop.  I had never seen a beer form a head in the bottle before this one.  The body was deep burgundy in color and after the initial rush of carbonation; there was little head to speak of.  The beer looked cloudy in the wine glass, while little light coming through.  The bouquet was rich and layered with aromas of fig, plum, raisin, toffee, chocolate, and maple.  The malt also presented itself on the tongue as a sweet and warm taste reminiscent of port wine.  Alcohol was not as well hidden as I though it would be, with distinct warmth that was pleasing.  Not much to counter the sweetness, as there was hardly any hop presence.  The beer was smooth and slippery on the palette with a prickly, peppery, and alcoholic aftertaste.  Two years of aging was not enough, as the rough edges were still a little grating.  Can do better with eight more years I think.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Lots of milk chocolate and alcohol (bourbon) in the nose and the flavor.  Vinous and chocolate in the nose with maybe a little dark fruit (cherry and fig) and a little bit of toffee and licorice.  Very syrupy mouthfeel.  Very astringent mouthfeel.  Very sweet mouthfeel.  Too sweet.  Too astringent.  As it warms, theres a small puff of smoke and a little roastiness, but its quickly beaten into submission by the chocolate.  For now, its decent, but Id like to pick up another and let it sit for 5+ years to see what happens.","Windsor, Connecticut, USA","SwedeDog"

2260,"2006-01-27",4.3,"This review is from notes I took on 12/22/05 at a beer bar in Peoria, IL., at a tasting that was advertised as the last vintage 2004 keg in the United States. I have to admit, also, that I become quite intoxicated that night, a good time was had by one and all. Made a very good appearance, poured into a standard bar chalice a dark copper brown with golden red hues and a tight foamy tan head that reduced to a sticky thin ringed lacing. Had a big, tasty fruity, citrus aroma, ripe dark fruits, grapefruit, spicy hops and a sweet maltiness. Moderate to good carbonation and a smooth full bodied mouth feel, good drinkability. A delicious taste, dry ripe dark fruits, a grapefruit citrusy, a mellow peppery, spicy hops, a sweet alcohol presence in the palate and a dry yeasty, sweet malty finish .","East Central, Georgia, USA","jpm30"
2260,"2006-01-26",4.8,"The bottle I sampled is the 2000 vintage, so this beer has just over 5 years of age on it, and according to the brewery, it can be cellared for much longer. This is a rich, delicious, complex, and flavorful Belgian brown ale, coming in at a hefty 8% abv. Later vintages has increased in abv.  It is sedimeted with yeast for a secondary fermentation in the bottle where it continues to condition and develop. I believe I made the correct decision in passing on this beer when I first saw it come out. The few years of age, has really brought out lots of complex flavor development in this beer, that might have been a bit too un-polished if consumed too young. 

Gouden Carolus Grand Cru of the Emperor pours to a beautiful, murky, deep caramel to brown color, with a thick and rocky tan head, and a lively carbonation. The nose on this beer is just packed with a multitude of complex aromas. Big aromas of candish sweet malt, caramel, raisin, peppery alcohol, and some spicy aroma of coriander flood the nose. The palate is rich and full with layers of flavors. Caramel, toffee, candi sugar, spice, and fruity esters of raisin, and black currants coat the tongue. Grand Cru of the Emperor finishes with more flavors of sweet malt and fruit up front, then ends with a spicy, peppery alcoholic burn. 

This is an absolutely delicious Belgian brown ale packed with big aromas and flavors. I really enjoyed this one, and believe this beer would work exceptionally well with a number of dishes, especially rich and chocolatey deserts. For me though, this beer is enjoyed best when consumed alone, so you can really work on this beer, and sip and savor the flavors and aromas.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

75cl bottle.  Pours a rusty orange and brown color, sitting in the glass a murky dark plum and brown hue.  Small toast colored head that dies quickly - which explains the low carbonation.  Cant say its bad - because its not infected or anything, but this is a 2002 bottle so perhaps the age is a factor.  Its a little flat, its chewy and semi-thick, smells wonderful: dates, wood, brown sugar, maple, spicy sugar and dark roasted plum scents.

It pours a clear, deep garnet body with brown highlights (or, was that the other way around?).  The tall light brown (not tan) head appears creamy, but on closer inspection is a bazillion soft-and-fizzy little bubbles.

Its full of carbonation (but not overly so) and hot with alcohol in the mouth.  The flavor is a marvelous blending of the tastes associated with the scents listed above, although probably not in the same order.

Dark brown with a huge, frothy, light-brown head. Extremely full-bodied, full of good ingredients. Loads of roasted malt with notes of syrup and dried fruits - dates in particular.

Aroma is very pleasant.  Tart raisins, champagne, alcohol, sweet fruit.  Flavor is definitely strongly influenced by the alcohol content, but at the same time rather smooth.

2260,"2005-07-04",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 19, 2007 A Mes rate:
***RE-RATE*** 2005 bottle from Moeder Lambic. Having had a hell of a lot of this over the years I figured it was worth a re-rate. I have had every vintage available of this glorious stuff and in my opinion the 2005 bottles are among the best. Deep dark red amber with a reasonable off white head. Nose of liquorice, sugar, molases, amazing sweet malt, caramel and just some light alcohol. Flavour has much more alcohol but not at all off putting. Cinnamon, bread, spice, ginger, spruce and liquorice. Awesome burnt caramel too. Complex as hell. Excellent body. Yes it is very sweet and if you dont like your beers on the sweet side it will not go down too well but for me it is one of my most regularly purchased beers and I love it everytime. ***ORIGINAL NOTES*** (Score: 7-3-8-4-17 = 3.9)
Yup its very good stuff. I have to buck the trend however and say personally I prefer the G.C. Noel. Ok down to business. Small head that cleared rather quickly unfortunately but I suspect this may have something to do with how this particular bottle had been stored. Murky mud brown body. Nose is glorious. Deep chocolate orange with smoky caramel and a spirit type hit there too. Palate is excellent, thick without feeling like syrup, just the right carb and goes down wonderfully smooth. Flavour is cherries, vanilla, caramel and slight mint??? Spruce maybe. Strange but good. Two things let it down for me. It has that hint of muskiness as if it has been allowed to pass its sell-by and the sediment has started to take over (this is only very slight but I noticed it with my first sip) and also the alcohol hits you right at the end and seems to spoil an otherwise very impressive finish. Ah well, what do I know? Heres to Charles the Fifth!","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

Enjoyed with shitty fireworks and a group of losers...Pours rusty red brown, slightly murky and topped with copious amounts of a warm woody tan head. Aroma is bright, spicy, and backed with some yeasty warmth. Flavors are complex and deep, but suffer on the palate level. The flavors morph and change as the beer warms and moves around in the mouth. It starts with a rich, cherry vinous domination, with lots of wine and brandy. It warms up, gains a good head of spicy alcohol, before finishing with a good rounded glowing yeast and bread profile. The palate is one leveled, sweet and hot from alcohol, without much change throughout. Aftertaste seems weak and diminished. Im surprised by the noticable effects of the hops in this beer, I would have expected a more diminished quality in that regard, but appreciate the roundedness they added to the beer. By far the best Belgian Ale Ive had.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Aroma of brown sugar, toffee, dark fruits, raisins, bread, alcohol and yeast.  Flavors were a swirling symphony of caramel, vanilla, sweet malt, pepper, molasses and plums.  The flavors intensified and became more enjoyable as the beer warmed and even though the alcohol content is high, its flavor is well hidden - it actually supports the other flavors.

The appearance is deep brown with a ruby hue.  The flavor begins with the base caramel, but dives into all kinds of areas (figs, maple, wood, apple).

Brown with yellow edges, and chunky like roast beef jus the next morning from the fridge with bits of fat hanging in the fluid.  Cola aroma, musty caramel and a hint of a peppermint note there.  Very light flavor, dry, yeasty. (original rating of 2000: 6-3-6-3-12: 3.0) // re-rate: 2005 Vintage, drank December 2005.  I said I would re-rate this because everyone told me that the 2000 vintage was especially weak.  Indeed, my impressions are better with this later vintage.  Irregular lace ring, ruby-brown body.  Heavy grape, port aroma, as well as Juicy Fruit gum.  Too much grape, however, makes it seem to crudely fruity.  Good control of the alcohol, but too sweet and lacking balance and subtlety.  Frothy, comfortable palate. // 2006 Vintage: very solid in most respects.

It did actually smell like a Flemish Sour at first, but that vanished quickly.  Malty and sugary flavor.  Spice and some spearmint.  Yeasty.  Upon warming, some tobacco and leathery notes.

Does an excellent job of mimicing the aroma in the flavor.  Medium body, creamy texture, average carbonation.

2260,"2004-07-14",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 27, 2008 Re-Rate. A 3.7 is way too low for this beer.  I think that it doesnt reach potential until at least two years aging.  Im drinking a 2006 bottle now, and its rich and full like an old Samichlaus, concentrated raisin covered in syrupy chocolate, but not creamy; the flavors are full and difident, but there is a clarity to the mouthfeel that makes this very refined.  Portish notes.  The very little alcohol that is detectable is a perfect counterpoint to the rich flavors. Rich on the smell, too, with caramelized and syruped brown sugar and some flowerish honey notes.  Wonderful beer.

Original Rating. Bottle (2004 vintage) into tulip glass; purchased at Discount Licquor (Milwaukee).  Since I bought two bottles of the stuff, I decided to have one now and lay the other one down.  While it was good now, every facet seemed like it was primed to age well.  The smell was malty and bread-y with very noticable alcohol and an unpleasant acetone tinge.  It smelled thick, and it was: syrupy, in fact.  Soft carbonation helped the texture, but with the underdeveloped flavors, the syrupy viscosity got to me a bit.  Dark reddish-brown in the glass, the head was initially very small and completely disappeared.  Despite this, the beer left nice small-bubble lacing on the side of the glass, more so as it got down to room temperature.  The taste and feel were much more like a barley wine than a Belgian strong in my mind.  It was sweet with dark fruity flavors that I couldnt distinguish and that I hope mature into complexity.  6/4/8/4/15= 3.7.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

2260,"2004-05-04",4.3,"2003 edition.  This beer ended up being an incredible pairing with Unibroue 10.  For some reason I was expecting a lighter-bodied beer, but this Grand Cru poured deep red-brown and somewhat cloudy with a medium-light off-white (light tan?) head.  Aroma was very potent and interesting- I picked up tangy, rotting fruit (not in a bad sense, of course), bubblegum, and even peat.  Awesome flavor profile- bubblegum and red licorice/strawberry candy flavors pierce the toasty body.  A touch of cinnamon, chocolate, and apple peel join alcohol in the finish.  This reminds me in a sense of Avery The Beast (with much lower ABV).  Its relatively heavy body, rich flavor, and nice blend of sweet and dry notes puts this beer in the upper echelon of Belgian Strongs.  Trying this back-to-back with Unibroue 10 was quite a treat for the senses- two beers with amazing, complex flavor profiles.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

Cherries again, and raisins, and vanilla, and caramel... its hard for me to come up with greater superlatives than I did on the ""regular"" rendition...this really is close to flawless.

The fruitiness is perhaps most reminiscent of dark cherries, though there are some subtle notes of peach as well.  This is quite good, very rich and a definite brew to savor.

Starts out a little sharp then branches out into some spices, perhaps a dash of cinnamon, as stated before I find brown sugar, and more caramel.

Pours a dark ruby with plum highlights topped by a creamy dark tan head with modest retention.  Decent lacing.  The aroma is quite lovely and slowly reveals dark fruits, such as raison and plum, hefty medicinal and clove phenolics, banana and bubblegum esters, caramel, sugar-drenched pineapple, spicy alcohol, and licorice.  The flavor is fairly sweet, with an initial burst of spicy fruit and clove phenolics.  Some banana too.  Moves to an earthy, yeasty character with some licorice and plum, then finishes rustic and slightly musty.  Hint of alcohol on the tail end, but the 10% is well disguised.  Its a bit watery in body, and could use a bit more oomph.  Regardless, this is a good brew and one Id like to try again after a few years of cellaring.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MarkR"
