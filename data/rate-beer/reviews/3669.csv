A: Mahogany body, light creme head, lacing.

N: Bourbon, oak, caramel, vanilla, smoke, toffee, more caramel, and licorice. 

T: Very sweet but not cloying.

M: Decent amount of alcohol here, medium body, lively carbonation.

O: Solid Old Ale. Its definitely intense and in your face; I prefer something with a bit more depth.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
3669,"2017-05-19",4.1,"Really liked this one. Pours a reddish brown color with a medium tan head. A big sugary nose, big barrel and syrup. Lovely big beer, berries, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, huge sweet malty base. Great beer.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
3669,"2017-05-16",3.9,"Bottle at Portland tasting. Dark caramelized brown, soapy off-white bubbles. Dense, sweet molasses. Very sweet, lightest coffee and tons of sweet fake maple syrup. Good bitterness. Interesting, sharp alcohol and malt vinegar. Nice.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
3669,"2016-09-29",4.1,"On draft at The Bruery. The pour is a dark caramel brown with a lack of any ring and a couple spots of lace. The aroma is thick caramel and a light vanilla. There is a good vanilla and a lovely dark fruit and barrel presence. He flavor is much of the same. So much caramel and barrel. The booze is light and the vanilla is well done. The time on this is beautiful. The mouth feel is a little heavier, but still thin with a nice carb and a good caramel and vanilla finish. Pretty basic. I think this one is in a weird period.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3669,"2016-09-19",4.3,"Draft at the Bruery. Muddy pour. Aroma of lots of bourbon, vanilla, raisin, nutty malt and ripe fruit. Taste is rich, with thick bourbon, nutty malt, hazelnut, vanilla, red ripe fruit and an infinite finish. Wow.","NETHERLANDS","MarcoDL"
3669,"2016-07-25",3.8,"On tap the beer pours a dark brown color with a small head. The nose has raisins, bourbon and dark malts. The taste has roasted dark fruits, bourbon, vanilla and some sweetness. Rich beer with a good finish.","Orange County, California, USA","ADfan"
3669,"2016-04-10",3.8,"Bottle thanks to Will. Pours a cloudy brown with beige head that lasts. The aroma is toffee, booze, vanilla. Thick mouth, similar flavors to nose, very boozy, lingering sweetness, very good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3669,"2016-03-28",4.0,"Tasted from 750ml bottle. Poured a dark brown color with a small sized tan head. Oak/wood, bourbon, vanilla, and brown sugary sweetness.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
3669,"2016-02-10",3.7,"On tap @ The Bruery. Pours murky brown with a light tan head. Notes of some toasted oak, scent forward bourbon and caramel. Somewhat boozy and definitely sugary. But not the usual over the top sugar like in the anno beers from The Bruery. Body is dense but not too syrupy. Worth a try.","USA","mrtripod"
3669,"2016-01-22",4.1,"On tap at The Bruery. Murky brown appearance with minimal head. Notes of toasted oak, vanilla, bourbon, caramel and light bread. The alcohol is hidden fairly well. Full bodied, rich and delicious overall.","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"
3669,"2016-01-18",4.4,"750ml bottle pours a dark brown color with a bit of fizzy head. More pronounced bourbon than the 6 and 12 and yet it balances well without overpowering. Rich bourbon flavor. More caramel than toffee.","California, USA","Bule"
3669,"2016-01-05",3.8,"5 Jan 2015, tap at the Bruery. Brown. Nose is nutty, sweet, fruit cake, bourbon, alcohol. Full body and mildly fizzy. Nutty, fruitcake, this is a typical Bruery big dark beer. Lots of alcohol, fruitcake, bitter chocolate. Nice.","California, USA","Blairgus"
3669,"2015-12-31",4.1,"Bottle. Deep murky brown color with solid head. Aroma is massive barrel and fruit. Taste is big boozy, dried fruit, vanilla wood. Best of the 3 so far.","bloomfield, Michigan, USA","mikem409"
3669,"2015-12-23",4.2,"Surprise fave so far without having had the 24.
Had 6 a while back in bottles, and 12 & 18 side by side at The Bruery. Differences enough to notice for sure, but not necessarily score them different (theyre all 4.1 or so).
Similarities in base beer to their AV beer. Barrel is sweet with vanilla and toffee. Theres a bit of a surprising depth in the 18 that wasnt in the 6 or 12, even though they are all what I refer to as diabetes beers. Good bordering on great sippers.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
