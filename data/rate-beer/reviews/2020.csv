2020,"2015-10-21",3.4,"Cask @ Town Hall. Deep Amber pour with an off-white head that produces plenty of lacing. Nose is full of pine. Pretty woody. Some caramel. Toasted bread. Taste is full of pine resin. Pine cone. PNW hopppiness. A bit of onion. Somewhat chewy. Caramel. Decent.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
2020,"2014-07-30",3.2,"Pour was orange type colored like an amber ale with a white small head and decent lacing. Aroma of faint pine and caramel. Flavor followed, caramel and toffee at the fore, toasted notes. Mouthfeel moderate in body and carbonation. An ok brew but kinda lost between black and std IPA, not bold enough in hops or malts to match the better red IPAs out there.","","User37895"
2020,"2014-01-09",3.3,"On tap @ Town Hall Tap. Pours a dark reddish orange appearance with a brown head. Nutty, cola, caramel, a bit spicy aroma. Cookie, toffee, kind of chewy, sweet caramel, somewhat piney hoppy flavor. A bit strange but not bad.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
2020,"2013-12-26",3.1,"I didnt find this at all compelling. Amber color. The aroma and flavors reminded me of something I would have had on a trip to Boston circa 2005--very standard brewpub fare, with a reasonable bill of hops and malts but nothing to stand out.

2020,"2013-11-25",3.5,"Growler sample via and shared with oakbluff. Very clear amber in colour with moderate carbonation. Very focused toffee and mint aromas. In the mouth, the toffee and herbal character is still present, but enhanced by some milk chocolate and toasted malt notes. Medium bodied and clean finishing. I didnt get much of the pine and citrus character that was advertised, but this is still a fairly successful and not overly sweet brown ale.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
2020,"2013-11-16",3.2,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2014 Tap at Town Hall. Clear amber pour with a smaller white head. Nice aroma of citrus hops and a little bit of chocolate. Taste seems a bit muddled to me - not sure if all of these elements come together all that well. Not bad though.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
2020,"2012-10-28",3.3,"Growler shared by yourefragile. Thanks Michael!

The beer is orange to light brown in color with a quarter inch of head that leaves some decent lacing on the glass. The aroma consists of pine, hops, and malt, respectively. The flavor struggles to achieve balance. While there are some potentially nice flavors lurking, the overall presentation is muddled. The finish is bitter, with a hint of alcohol. Medium bodied with a creamy feel. A few tweaks and this might be a great beer.

Deep brown pour with a good amount of beige head.  Nose is quite hoppy with grapefruit and pine - also a nice roasted malt presence as well.  Flavors of citrus, caramel, and roast.  I really enjoyed this.","Plano, Texas, USA","Dixonian"

Pours a moderate brown color with a single-finger off-white head and some stick lacing on the way down. Thin collar throughout.

The nose carries through a bit of roasted malt and some light chocolate notes plus some pretty good pine character. The flavor blends the malt and hop components quite well with pine balancing roast. Medium body with a good bitterness in the finish.

2020,"2011-06-18",3.8,"on tap at the brewery pours brown with a medium tan head.  Aroma is pine and very hop driven with thin caramel and roast in the background.

2020,"2011-06-05",4.0,"Yum. Frothy, creamy, off-white head. Malty, sweet aroma with underlying citrus notes. Amber-brown color. Deliciously smooth texture with a very nice balance between malt and hops. Starts out similar to a brown ale with sweet malts and finishes similar to a nutty IPA with flavors of citrus, pine, caramel, hazelnut, and cream. Very simple, yet complex mix of beer types.","Richfield, Minnesota, USA","nsquishee"
2020,"2011-02-04",3.8,"Draft at Town Hall. Pours a reddish brown, on the pale side for sure. Fluffy head. Nose is faded chocolate, fresh citrus and resin and a clean ester profile. On taste, well rounded malt character lending a bread note that fades into a pleasing level of bitterness. Fresh citrusy notes and more resiny pine come into play and work well with a slight ester note. Pretty solid beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"

2020,"2010-12-22",3.8,"On Tap.  Pours a clear copper, nice looking dense light tan head.  Fades to a decent ring of lacing after getting pretty rocky as it dropped.  Nice malt tones, with some floral hops in there, touch of citrus out of the glass as well.  Taste is somewhat underwhelming, but gets better as it warms.  Lasting bitterness backed by a bit of sweet malt some decent oaky tones in there as well.  Overall, a refreshing, though not overwhelming take on the style.  Some really nice flavors in here.","California, USA","LamarBurton"
2020,"2010-12-17",3.9,"Draft. Poured into a pint glass a clear slightly reddish tinged brown color with a off white 1 finger head. Nice balance in the nose of both hops and malt. Medium mouthfeel.

2020,"2010-12-10",3.6,"On tap at the brewpub. Poured a clear orange amber with a slight grayish brown head that dissipated to the edges and laced.

2020,"2008-03-19",3.9,"On tap at the pub.  Exactly what it sounds like, this is somewhere between a sweet british ale and an IPA, like a very malty, sweet ale, but with a great hops finish.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Tweety"

2020,"2008-02-04",3.9,"Picture Masala Mama with a very slight brown ale flavor, then you have Town Hall India Brown Ale.  This really is an IPA, with very little malt.

2020,"2008-01-29",3.6,"Draft at brewpub at the 2008 debut release. Some hop in the nose although nothing overly distinctive. Amberish. Hazy dark red with a tan head. Some lace. Head not all that lasting. Strong with a Surly Furious-esque harshness brought on by the interplay between Amarillo hop and chocolate malt. Long, hoppy finish. A very nice brew that expertly achieves that which was intended and which I understand is a great accompaniment to islays jalapeño cheese pretzels.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
2020,"2008-01-28",3.6,"UPDATED: AUG 24, 2014 Pint on tap at the brewpub at the official 2008 release on 1-28-08. Fresh, strong, floral aroma that is both malty and hoppy. Peach, mango, rose, and caramel scents. Pours a clear, medium brown or dark copper with an amber hue. Produces a nice, red-brown glow. Small to moderate amount of short-lasting, uneven, beige head. Produces nice lacing. Tastes of toasted malt and dry hops. This definitely is what it claims to be, a hopped up brown ale. Caramel and bread flavors from the malt. Grapefruit and pine from the hops. Light fruit taste; a touch of strawberries and cream. At first, the IPA character dominates, but sweet, brown sugar-like malt taste overcomes the hops after multiple sips. Medium body. Smooth and lively in the palate. Very drinkable. Im giving this only a 15 overall because it was between a 3 and 4 in appearance and a 7 and 8 in flavor, and I went high in both cases. Nonetheless, it probably deserves a 16. Town Hall India Brown Ale surpassed my expectations to become one of my favorite Town Hall brews. It was a great accompaniment to my jalapeno cheese pretzels. 8/4/8/4/15=>3.9

 <P>2nd review. Approximately 10 oz. from a pint pour, on tap at Town Hall Lanes in South Minneapolis. Consumed on 8-24-14. Listed on the menu as ""Town Hall I.B.A.,"" with the style listed as ""India Brown Ale."" Pours a clear, light to medium brown with an amber hue and a small amount of beige head. Scents of chocolate, brownie, and lightly roasted coffee. Caramel flavor with a smoky finish. Seltzer or tonic water flavors from the hops. The taste is weak and disappointing, and it doesnt seem nearly as hoppy as I would expect from a beer labeled as ""India..."" Medium body. Lively and refreshing in the palate. Good palate effects. 6/4/6/4/13=>3.3

2020,"2007-07-10",3.8,"Dark brown color with a thin head.  Good aroma of chocolate, toffee and pine.  The taste starts chalky and dry, then moves to a toasted malt body.  Slightly fruity, yet not sweet at all.  Very nice.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
2020,"2007-04-10",3.7,"Growler taken from the brewpub.  Aroma:  Lightly sweet maltiness with a touch of chocolate and toasted nuts.  Lots of hops with big citrus and pineapple character, followed by some floral and earthy notes.  Appearance:  Deep copper in color and lightly hazed.  Medium beige head was full and foamy with good retention.  Nice lacing.  Flavor:   Lightly sweet roasted malt with notes of chocolate, toasted nuts, and toffee.  Hops kick in strong with a touch of resin, a strong citrus/pineapple, and a lingering herbal/floral note.  Bitterness is just enough to cleanse the palate.  Finishes fairly dry and clean.  Palate:  Medium bodied.  Medium carbonation.  Overall:  Great beer, and Im glad I got a chance to try it.  Well balanced.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","RagallachMC"
2020,"2007-04-08",3.7,"This is good.  Brown?  No; too much hop character for a brown.  More IPA than brown.  The hop aroma is strong and herbal.

2020,"2007-04-01",3.6,"Ruby-oak appearance.  A lovely initial aroma of tropical hops.  Pineapple, mandarin orange.  Eventually the dark grains, woods, and brown sugars dominate.  Flavor develops similarly: the hops create intrigue before giving way to darker tastes.  Palate is crisp with an underlying richness.  Strikes a good balance.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

2020,"2007-03-17",3.1,"On Cask. Little aroma is caramel malt aroma. Cloudy copper color looks just a bit darker than the cask IPA.

2020,"2007-03-16",3.6,"Cask at pub.  Brown/copper with a frothy whith head.  A nice brown that had just a hint of bitterness that didnt go real well with the initial taste for me.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","undsioux7"
2020,"2007-02-12",4.3,"Pours clear - a deep copper brown with half an inch of soft tan suds. Excellent head retention, thick count-the rings lacing. Juicy citrus hop bitterness in the aroma.

Flavor - toasted and chocolate malt, both in large quantities. Citrus and herbal hop flavor, both in large quantities. A touch of dry grain in the finish. Long citric hop bitterness in the finish. All of these blend and meld, even though they sound like they might not (big chocolate and citrus hops?). The balance is exemplary - between malt an hops, between sweet and dry, between powerful and subtle.

Smoothly carbonated (lending a cask like character). Medium body.","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"
2020,"2006-06-08",3.9,"Ruddy brown the color, cream-toned the foam, of stable size, if thin, and adorned with copious bubbles.

Miild, sweet cocoa in the aroma, little bit of nuts. And then the hops come shining through. Pleasant enough.

Bright, bold, and delicious once in the mouth. Clean, smooth and indubitably drinkable. Chocolate tones remain in the flavor, hops persist on the tongue. A twist of citrus, lacing the chocolate. Zesty, medium bodied, long, hoppy finish. 

A tasty, tasty ale you drink all the live-long day and not likely tire of. Does some playful tricks on the tongue, and rewards the imbiber. I like that. Must stop in for more before it goes away. Thats how they get ya, man!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
2020,"2006-05-24",4.5,"On Cask: dark rusty brown with thin but fluffy cap. Nose includes some tropical fruit stuck together with molasses. The flavor...oh my. The mango, the pineapple is indeed marinating in blackstrap. I thought this was good pushed, but on cask, it is heavenly. Malted roastiness comes out in the aftertaste. The body, if one were to close the eyes (which happens...cant help it with this beer) is more IPA like. It is the PERFECT marriage of IPA and a Brown Ale. The hops and malt play ping pong on the palate. For the love of all things holy, try this beer.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","BitterPoet"
2020,"2006-05-11",4.0,"slightly tarnished ruby hued brown. Thin cap of lightly tanned foam whisps away quickly to leave a thin collar and very little lacing. Just a few small spotty areas.

Aroma is partially rubbery in a malt tang and chocolate hued with tinges of dark orange citrusy hop notes and a slight roasted hilt about the edges. It seems to have weak points and heavy points in the nose. Inconsistant. But when ya can get it, its fairly complex.

Flavors are wonderfully blended with a great pale roasty malt backing with hovering chocolate notes hitting here and there. The hops have a unique woodish tint as it goes through the middle. Finish brings in some mildly and quite yummy tones of dark orange citrusy bitterness and alpha acidic parching cruising along the chocolaty/roasty backing. One complex finish thats very interesting; its kinda smokey, deep, grassy, herbal, chocolatey, and orangely bittered. Wow. And nothing really stands out, it just all takes seats to one another until they all grow together to fade away slowly into the end... into memory. Hmmm...I tend to think of a toned down version of 3F Alpha Klaus after ever sip. A good thing to have a comparison to. Yummy, delicious, yum!

Feel is clean within a slippery medium-light tilted body, respectfully quick without leaving out much action on the tongue as the flavors tend to do the most part of its character. Eagerly pleasing to quaff. Man, Oh, man does this stuff just float right down. Absolutely fine and dandy - just like chocolate hop candy!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
