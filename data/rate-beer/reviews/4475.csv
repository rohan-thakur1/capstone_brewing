4475,"2017-04-17",3.7,"Bottle. Golden colored and hazy with full fine frothy head. Strong tropical nose, passion fruit, notes of pineapple along with critrus and lemon. Slight sweet beginning and a nice strong but not overwhelming bitterness and good dry finish. Well balanced while dominated by bitterness. Full thick body, medium carbonation and a fuzzy, later, foamy mouthfeel. Flavor is tropical, passion fruit and citrus, some spices and with a malty touch, noticable yeast note and some alcoholic pepper in the end. Quite complex, however harmonic and balanced.","GERMANY","bartholos"
4475,"2017-04-05",3.7,"33cl bb10/2017, Maruhn. Q: if an ale is frozen, can it technically be an EisBOCK, aka a lager? Or is it just a DIPA boosted by oldschool cryogenics and dryhopping? - Any case, this is a DIPA/IIPA obtained by re-hopping one of the more democratic DE/US crossover APAs, the Atlantik Ale. - Aroma isnt too intense, rather condensed like canned pineapple juice, vanilla powder, dank citrus pith with a tinge of abv. - Flavour also dried pineapple slices, intensely, almost one-sidedly dry grapefruit pith and lingering, near-scratchy dry pine. A bit of a one-tracker with rougher edges - but nicely executed and tastefully marketed.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"
4475,"2017-04-01",4.4,"330ml bottle via trade with Koelschtrinker. Thank you!
Looks: Clear golden honey colour; Three finger head with crumpety white foam which lasts for 4 minutes; Beautiful sticky lacing with active carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and fruity Ale malt, with lemon candy, strong citrus, passion fruits, light peaches, faint pineapples, floral, sugar, spices, light resins, biscuits and fresh grass. Refreshing!

Taste: Mid to strong sweet rich Ale malt, with grapefruits, strong citrus peels, yellow fruits, light floral, molasses, spices, resins, strong herbs, thick bread, strong lime, strong bitter hops and fresh grass. Really nice!

Body: Full body. Thick, oozy and very creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: Rich Ale matyness in a very thick, almost bready Pils-like background, so creamy its like sipping a citrus pie from glass and I kid you not! Lively citrus hoppiness takes centre stage, with strong lime peels, grapefruits, yellow fruits compliments the fat malt very well. Pretty flowery with strong but nice sweetness. Resin ooze is obvious but not overdone. Spicy bready with strong lime and herbs to round. Very fruity and sunny!

Alcohol: the 8.5% booze taste is well hidden but the Pils maltyness and the fruity herbal hops. No knock on whatsoever. Excellent!

Hoppiness: Lemon candy, citrus, passion fruits, light peaches, faint pineapples, floral, spices, resins and fresh grass in nose. Grapefruits, strong citrus peels, yellow fruits, light floral, spices, strong resins, strong herbs, strong lime and fresh grass in taste; Bitterness is strong for a lasting, high astringent bitter-sweet herbal malty finish.

After Taste: Dry. Limey, oozy and strong bitter to mouth.

Comments: Given the Nordik Porter I had last night, I thought this one would be a heavy slab of freeze-distilled IIPA, so I am genuinely surprised that it tastes almost like a German Pils with citrusy hoppiness so lively and sparkling, not-so-demanding ooze, and damn right on sweetness. This is exactly my ideal IIPA, and it was done in the Eisbock fashion so this is amazing. Two thumbs up!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

4475,"2017-02-18",3.6,"0.33 l bottle from the brewerys web shop, best before December 2017. Clear, golden yellow with a medium large, foamy, stable, white head. Sweetish, fruity, grassy, slightly resiny and minimally herbal aroma of passion fruit, lemongrass, pineapple and hints of spruce. Rather sweet, slightly bitter, fruity, herbal-grassy and a little resiny taste of passion fruit, lemon peel, pineapple, lemongrass and a touch of spruce, followed by a medium long, quite dry-bitter, grassy-spicy, slightly resiny and a little herbal, almost peppery finish. Medium to full body, slightly oily and moderately effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Very interesting, quite intense but also refreshing and surprisingly quaffable.","Hagen / Bonn, GERMANY","Zlotta"

4475,"2017-01-27",3.5,"0,33 l bottle. Pours to light yellow amber, to cloudy body with dense white head. Aroma has mango, citrus and peaches, with some sweet grassy notes. Palate is medium full. Carbonation is soft , soapy, overall watery. Taste has strong bitter flavour with dry afterkick. Finish comes quickly and lingers on the tongue. It calls itself Eisbock, but basically it is a strond ABV DIPA. The flavors of fruity hops are there as is palate but overall it has medium to monotous character. Still nice easily drikable IPA with 8,5 ABV, yet nothing new.","Berlin, GERMANY","edpeg"
