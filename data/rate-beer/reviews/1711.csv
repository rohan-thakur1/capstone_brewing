1711,"2017-06-22",4.1,"0,5l bottle. Hazy, thick dirty orange colour with huge but shrinking and staying in small size, foamy off-white head. Aroma: Banana, biscuit, light caramel and roasted coffee bean (!!) notes. Taste: Very rich and sweet malty start (with lots of rostieness) and seems light but then a growing sourish tone comes that turns into a lgith, softly bitter mouthfeel. Has a foamy texture but not as creamy as some other examples. Medium body with fizzy carbonation. Long sourish but sweet, a little bit acidic and dry finish.

Appearance: Off brown, deep golden orange with slight haziness. Pours with a two finger head that retains quite well. 


Aroma: Started off with a earthy yeasty dominant aroma with slight metallic smell. Swirling and subsequent whiffs reveals a pleasant but subtle banana and vanilla notes. Banana aroma is must subtler compared to other weizens.


Taste: Taste is predominated by yeast and breadiness with only very slight hints of banana fruitiness to balance it out. As such the overall taste is quite dry and has restrained esters profile. Bitterness is low to almost non existent. It finishes off with subtle banana and slight clove like spiciness. The finish slowly develops into a buttery bready and nutty flavor.


Palate: Light mouth feel with a slight watery texture. Medium and lively carbonation that isnt overpowering. 


Overall : A very well balanced weizen that does not accentuate any certain aspects. Easygoing and unpretentious and no doubt quite refreshing it has something very classic about it. Though it would be better off with more fruitiness and tartness to balance off the breadiness.","SINGAPORE","PoPzHa"

Comments: an above-average hefeweiss, with looks felt bit flat too soon, decent smell, too light a taste and a palate being spoiled by presence of phenol element.

Appearance: Pours out a cloudy, very dark gold body with a creamyish, off-white head that settles down at a quick rate.

Smell: Wheat bread dough marked by a soft, subtle spiciness, hints of caramelly sweetness, and a gently fruity addition of chopped bananas and orchard fruit.

Taste: Bready, doughy, moderately tangy wheat malt with a fair amount of overall sweetness and low taste of caramel. Quick dash of cider. Yes, youve got your banana esters and clove bud accents, but its not nearly as forceful as some hefes can be. Light hop character, bitterness. Small pinch of ground mace for spicy, sweetish, crispish finish.

I dont really like the aroma of this beer.  Somehow the banana, bubblegum, clove, hops, malt, which are all present, combine to smell like that rotting leaves aroma that one experiences in the late fall/early spring.  Appears brownish-orange and cloudy with yeast, plus a lasting white cover.  Sort of boring flavour: weak clove, with a touch of banana bubblegum, plus mineral water.  Some faint corriander and celery come in late.  Moderate carbonation, a bit dry finish, light body.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"

Looks good in the glass, a deep translucent orange body, and fluffy white head, but there is no real depth of flavor here, and it had a slick, oily palate. The other two I had in Germany, this was poured in London, but I dont see why that should make much of a difference. It was also served very cold.

1711,"2007-01-01",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 11, 2011 After having had several cases of this, I feel the need to re-rate this one, that was the main reason for falling in love with nice German Weissbiers. The color is unclear, dark orange, and the head is huge and creamy. The aroma is harmonic with equal parts of spicy yeast (not too much or too little), lovely banana and wheat, that never is dominating or too grain. The same goes for the sweet, soft and pleasant flavour, that makes it hard to stop drinking it. From time to time I have had the opportunity to have it from tap  and I hope thats what heaven is like  IF I ever go there ;)
2005 when I just started liking weissbier: Nice, hazy, red golden color and a very huge and stable head. The aroma has notes of wheat and fruit and the mouth feel is surprisingly oily considering the style. The flavour is quite unique, it has wheat, but also a lot of other notes like honey, clover, flower, light fruit (banana and others) and the bitterness is of course minimal.

Quite light in carbonation, unusual for a weiss, with a sloppy, messed up head of cream donning it, holding there and lacing well as it sunk into the stein. Aroma of a bakery at dawn, wholemeal and fresh sliced white bread, a little raw malt and a closer link showing of banana esters and spicy phenols. Big toasted malts in the mouth, husky, gritty, rough, fresh. This holds some very complex, well defined malt flavours. It is also peaty, nutty and earthy as it moves back towards the tonsils and long into the swallow. Reminds me of Düsseldorfs morning beers. There is a strong presence of smoke that builds with each sip. Lingering flavours of burnt, damp wood, overripe bananas and cloves aid this. Down into the swallow it is peaty and woody, volatile and lingering - a lovely depth of flavour. Body is firm, though quaffable. Carbonation holds all in check. This is lovely stuff.

1711,"2005-07-17",3.1,"500ml bottle at 5.4% from beersofeurope.co.uk. I thought this was a rather unusual hefe.  For a start, its rather darker than the norm - a rather murky amber colour. The head dispersed very quickly. There are some banana esters in the aroma, but its quite restrained. I didnt pick up much in the way of spices.  The flavour is more citric than usual with an underlying sharp acidity, although it finishes up quite sweet.  Quite yeasty and theres also an unexpected touch of malt there too. Light mouthfeel.

Drank this from the bottle, so I couldn't tell the color well. But drinking from the bottle did kick up a nice foamy head inside, and there was a fine coating of yeast at the bottom of the bottle. Presented a nice wheaty nose when I opened the bottle. The usual clove and banana tastes only became apparent after the first few sips.

Like King Arthur searching for the holy grail, I trekked in vain to store after store, and then one day - there it was.  Remembering it to be the best German Wheat I'd ever had, I took it home to a 3-way tasteoff with current champs Hacker-Pschorr Weisse and Weihenstephaner Weisse only to have Maisels come up just a tad short.  It was magnificently wheaty, yes, and complex and full of yeasty cloudiness, but it was more bitter than the others and had a crispness I didn't care for.

Very different from any other hefe or witbeir Ive experienced.  The yeast lends a defined sourness and lemon flavor in the aftertaste.  Malt and as yet unidentified fruit up front.  Yeast and malt in the nose.  A large, off white head on a deep copper, cloudy beer is quite beautiful.  Fairly soft on the palate, but very acceptable none-the-less. Absolutly NOT a typical white beer, as user_experience pointed out.  It is, however, quite good all around.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"
1711,"2001-10-31",2.3,"The commercial description might be misleading. This is not a typical white beer. Its hardly cloudy and not white but a deep copper. The aroma leans less from yeast and banana, which is but an aromatic hue, to more typical carmel and alcohols. There are also non-dominant apple fruit components. Very carbonated from the bottle with a gorgeous presentation, warming decreases the initial fizz and after five minutes or so becomes much more palatable with the yeast components waking up with delicate bitters as well.
