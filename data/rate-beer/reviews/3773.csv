3773,"2017-04-08",4.2,"Pours orange-amber into the glass, with a nice eggshell head that leaves window-wash lacing. The nose is of orange, tangerine and mixed citrus zest (some lemon-lime predominant), amongst citric hops. Orange, tangerine and lemon-lime flavors mingle with a nice, lightly peppering hop, finishing with a curt, citric zest/peel bitterness. The integration here is perfect: a combination of a medium-full body and zesty mouthfeel that keeps the palate active, concentrating on citrus notes, alongside nice citric hop bitters. I do not use the word ""citrus"" so much unless it is in tandem with the essential aspects of the brew. Juicy, lively, complex-for-days, this is a very unique take on the Weizen-Bock style... and one that craves for another... and another. Superior brew here! Kudos to Lagunitas on this offering.

Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, apricot, mango, melon, lemon, pear, banana, pepper, clove, light bubblegum, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness.

Lightly increasing dryness from bitter/spiciness as well. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/grainy, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice.

3773,"2015-10-01",3.4,"January 28th, 2012 - I havent seen this since my sampling back in 2012, but Id love to see it around again. It lacks some of that hard-edged sweetness that appears now and again in batches of beer from Lagunitas, exhibiting a yeasty flavor with a touch of bitterness, though a crisper kind of bitter, less hop dependent. Thats wreathed by dry toffee and light caramel notes, and with a sticky string of butterscotch. But the draw for me is the yeast, which in the flavor grants a great fermentable depth and umami. Meanwhile, the smell also employs the yeast, where it goes off more of a wheat and fresh dough kind of scent, complemented by a little white grape and even a smear of peanut butter. Curious, but the taste is the star here, and the object of focus. I hope this comes back someday - would love to see how it tastes with a few more years of sampling beers under my somewhat larger belt.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Effervescent and gently acidic and warming on the palate, for all of the sweetness present, this coupled with the late bitterness ultimately has a nice refreshing effect.  Body is fairly full.  Highly enjoyable and tasty.  Who knew Lagunitas was so good at making German styles?","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
3773,"2012-04-24",3.7,"Appearance: a gentle haze obscures the colors of a flickering flame while a soft bready head lingers as a thick blanket. Lace abounds.

Nose: yeasty, spicy, doughy, and tropical all at the same time. Stewed peaches, apricots, bananas, and tropical fruit skins. Coconuts in the raw. White pepper and cumin. Whole pineapples. Fermented honey-soaked grains.

Palate: yum! Fermented honey and grains  crispy, crunchy, honeyed. Raw and unfettered than spiced with warmth lingering in the chest. Banana skins, white pepper, ginger, and cumin are a massive presence in the middle. Chewy yeasty dough. Banana weaves throughout. Carbonation dissipates rather quickly, leaving about a half full glass with a silky denser boozier spicier chewier presence.

Final Thoughts: for as much as I enjoyed the Bavarian-style Doppelweizen from Lagunitas, I find myself not remembering much of what I tasted, even as I write them down once more, this time in a review. Definitely a good beer, unique, but lacking a certain je ne sais quoi to remember it by.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"
3773,"2012-04-22",4.0,"Sampled on 4/22/2012. This weizen bock pours a medium orange gold color from a 22oz bottle. Medium sized white foamy head with nice retention and good lacing. The aroma is fruity and sweet, banana, clove, with some orange and orange peel. And yes there are some hops as well. It wouldnt be a Lagunitas beer if it did not have some hops now would it? A medium to full bodied weizen bock. The malts are fruity, caramel and sweet, with a bunch of banana and clove. The hops are herbal and spicy with a touch of citrus. Lively carbonation. Nice yeasty flavor, with a lot of banana. Its hoppy for a weizen bock, but not for a Lagunitas beer. Was someone physically holding the brewer back fro adding EMH (even more hops). The yeast and the hops shine through in this beer, with a touch of hops at the finish. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

If this didnt say Lagunitas on the label and was made in Germany, I believe many people would think that this one of the best Weizen Bocks in the world.

A - Poured a 2-finger white head that subsided very fast. The beer is a 3 on the SRM scale in color. Its a tan to golden tan beer very clear, very beautiful. A very very nice beer!

S - Wow. Excellent dry german yeast scent hits me almost instantly. The honey malts take over next followed by some kind of fruit like apricots, mango or pineapple. Its a very German beer but a lot sweeter than most Bavarian style Weizens Ive had.

T - Oh yes. There is that classic German taste. Dry, light fruits, wheat and roastiness. Theres a walnut characteristic to this beer and a bit of pine resin from the small amount of hops added. It has a lot of characteristics youd find in a Pinot Grigio that had set out for a while and allowed to breathe and then force carbonated to some intense levels. Its very German but also very unique. This is an extremely tasty beer!

M - 95% carbonation on a mouth swish. Medium bodied and lingering honey and syrup taste after swallowing.

O - Yeah, I LOVE this beer. Its everything I love about German beers and nothing that I dont love.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

Its genuinely an unpleasant surprise to have this beer (which comes in a 22) smack you in the face when you take what you expect to be a long and delicious draught.

Complex aroma with a nice balance of zesty spice, light fruit, citrus rind and bready yeast. Theres a peppery clove presence that is countered by hints of banana, orange peel, bread and chocolate. 

Full bodied with a nice creamy texture and a blast of zesty spice up front that lingers over the sweet fruit and yeast notes into a tart, dry finish. Lots of peppery clove followed by a prominent bready yeast character that gives fullness to the palate. This is followed by faint banana and malt sweetness before the citrus fruit kicks in. Lots of zesty orange and lemon peel rounding which in addition to providing sweetness, is a nice compliment to the heavy spice character. The ABV is excellently masked with no heat to speak of but there is a lot going on here and its very full bodied making it a bit of a sipper. 

Overall this beer was a success. Usually Im not into American Imperial versions of German styles but this beer is well balanced and really tasty. Its a bit heavy handed but they managed to capture some great flavors that are characteristic of the style. Nice job Lagunitas!","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

As it mingles with the tongue, it reverts back to its roots, clovey, yeasty, and tart.  The ending is my favorite part.  Notes of the hops and their peppery goodness make themselves known.

3773,"2011-11-15",3.6,"Sampled on tap at 1702, Tucson, November 2011
Arrives from the tap with a fluffy, one-finger thick, pale tan colored head that is quite tight and creamy textured.  The beer is a clear, hazy, gold-straw color that shows more of the same, though a litte lighter, when held up to the light.  The aroma smells like an expressive HefeWeizen with notes of clove, soft banana, some softly tart wheat, hay like grain and sweet, honey-like malt notes.  This is quite nice and at first blush reminds me a lot of New Glarus Weizen (though this is a bit lower in alcohol than that one, despite that one being labeled as a regular HefeWeizen).

Soft and creamy feeling up front, it picks up some carbonic prickliness towards the middle, but finishes with a linger, light viscousness that sticks a bit to the palate.  The clove flavor really lingers in the finish, and there is also a spiciness to the finish that is accentuated by the phenolic clove character and even picks up a touch of peppery spiciness (though some of that is likely accentuated by the pizza I just had).  Hay like grain notes mix with a touch of herbal-honey like malt character and even a touch of seeming herbal hop character.  The hop character contributes a touch of bitterness that isnt quite biting.  Other traditional HefeWeizen notes of banana, a hint of tartness and a nicely rounded pale malt and wheat flavor also play a role here.

I doubt this beer was decocted, but it is big enough that it does mimic the rich malt character that traditionally decocted HefeWeizens achieve. This is definitely quite nice and I am really enjoying this beer right now.  The phenolics can get a touch spicy and plastic like (perhaps) in the finish at times, but this is reasonably held in check.  This has a surpisingly complex yeast character (coming from an American Brewery, hell even your typical German one) that I am really enjoying.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Almost a belgian yeast taste through the finish. Definitely more than just a touch boozy. Well-carbonated with a lingering spicy aftertaste. Not bad, but not their best offering. Too ""Lagunitas"" for me, meaning I dont think their extreme attitude really matches up with a nuanced style like a weizenbock.

Aroma of grapes, candi sugar, pear, a generally fleshy fruit aroma, sugary and somewhat like clean spring water.  Definite alchohol in the nose, almost overpowering.  Flavor is golden wheat, a light acidic bite, alcohol, sugar, strong malt.  Mouthfeel is alcoholic, hot, lightly carbed, nearly fusel, very hot, alerts the brain to danger, exciting, arousing.  Very similar to some Belgians, reminiscent of Tripel Carmelite.  Variety of malts and raw grains.  Sugary.  Yeast by-products from hot ermentation.  Combine flavor with hot finish, lasting sugary character, so sweet it lingers on the lips, finishes on tongue and lips, reeks of danger.  All in all it is completely out of style.  For the style it has a terrible aroma, wrong palate, wrong taste.  But this is a sexy, risky beer, dangerous and exciting.  Overall this is the shit.","Oregon, USA","benjaminbier"

Flavor improves a bit.  The typical hefe-ish banana sweetness form the nose dominates the flavor.  More hop character than is usual for the style (not surprising coming from Lag), with citrus and peppery notes, and pepper sharpness that lasts through the finish.  Relatively smooth on the palate, though the finish gets really heavy on the booze as it warms.

Palate is nice carbonation in the mouth, medium to full bodied, lively and somewhat astringent on the finish.

Upon closer inspection: ripe banana, vanilla, 4VG (clove) - lighter end of things, cardamom, and quite a bit of a grainy wheat character. Esters and a bit of fusel alcohol. Bready and biscuity, light caramel. Besides the somewhat harsh alcohol, this smells quite good!  Flavors fall a bit short. Lots of vanilla and banana esters. Sharp, somewhat solvent and lightly peppery alcohol notes. Really nice bready and perhaps slightly too caramely/caramelized notes. Minimal phenol. A slight bitterness towards the back of the tongue in the finish that I cannot place (doesnt seem to be hop based). Creamy carbonation, somewhat light bodied for what I was expecting. Warming.

3773,"2011-09-24",3.3,"22 ounce bottle - $4.29 at Total Wine & More in Alpharetta, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours a clouded, darkened orange body with a small, short-lived, pure white head.

Smell: Sweet-scented, tangy-accented wheat malts with a generous helping of cloves, mashed-up nanas, some wafting traces of alcohol, and even some bitter orange rind.

Taste: Sharply sweet, a bit sugary even (like doughnut glaze), atop some bready, honeyed malts. Twangy wheat flavor, a bit grainy, but quickly the heavily phenolic, clove-like spiciness shoves that noise right oughta the way, which itself is firmly butted up against the warm alcohol giving a drip of 99 Bananas. Some orange peel hints that, like the banana esters pairing with the alcohol, also hits the booze, hinting at Cointreau, soon becoming belly-warming. A drop of vanilla cream. A few Chiclets. Sweetish, fruity finish. Quite heated at the tail end.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-plus carbonation.

Overall: Not as well-rounded and refined as its German counterparts; its kind of a slow sipper. Might be one to let sit in the bottle for a bit. Still, its a decent beer, not great, no, but is available at a comparatively lovely price (God bless ya for it, Lagunitas).","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

3773,"2011-09-23",3.4,"(bottle)  Pours a very hazy orange color with a thin white head and minimal lacing.  The aromas not bad, and possesses most of what youre looking for in a weizenbock, with plenty of banana, clove, and bubblegum scents, but there are also some scents which are quite unexpected such as canned salmon and another that smells reminiscent of methane.  The fruity and spicy scents do a good job of keeping these at bay, but they do lurk underneath the surface and emerge from time to time.  Flavor is pretty straightforward, and is far better than the aroma, with plenty of caramel to start things, followed up by a good amount of banana and even some peach.  The finish brings some crisp wheat, but this unfortunately descends into a metallic twang that I did not care for.  Booze burns a bit as well which doesnt help matters.

Taste: Similar to the aroma, with loads of sweet banana and bubblegum, at least at first. Then the hops and clove come in and provide some great balance. Ends with lingering pepper and clove.

Palate: Creamy full body with moderate carbonation. Surprisingly dry finish after the initial sweet onslaught.

Overall: This is a great Weizenbock, and I seriously do not know what is wrong with the reviewers to date. I usually do not like it when Lagunitas steps away from their hoppy comfort zone, but this is incredible.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

3773,"2011-09-21",3.7,"9/21/11. 22oz bottle. Hazy orange pour with a nice creamy tan head that sticks and laces nicely. Fruity, yeasty aroma with big, spicy phenolics. Sweet, bready entry with nice soft wheat, a touch of tang, creamy bananas, and more big spice. Not bad!","Georgia, USA","drowland"
3773,"2011-09-21",3.3,"Bottle - 22 oz. Pours a cloudy yellowish amber color. Aromas of citrus, bananas, hay, and some bready malt. Wish it tasted as good as it smelled, but this one just didnt do it for me. Tasted barely of the ""weizen"" family... light sweet flavors of caramel, but followed by a slightly bitter hop finish. Was expecting a more tarditional german style, but knowing its Lagunitas, I should have expected the hoppy overtones. Carbonation is low, but high abv is noticeable and it becomes more like numerous other strong ales out there the more sips you take. Decent beer, but was expecting something more/ different.","California, USA","ChapelThrill"
3773,"2011-09-21",4.0,"22oz bottle.  thick, viscous, honey-like pour that has a very cloudy appearance in the glass under a small, creamy, white head.  sweet, robust nose of dough and banana.  palate is fittingly full, but a bit over-carbonated for me.  flavors of banana, a hint of alcohol, a twist of grapefruit bitterness i didnt see coming judging from the aroma, marshmallow and doughy yeast.","","SSSteve"
3773,"2011-09-20",3.1,"Bottle.  Nice hazy dark orange pour, a little carbonation and a very banana forward aroma.  Flavor is slick bready banana, sweet and very alcoholic on the aftertaste.  I can see this beer being a lot better if they dialed back the alcohol content.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","DalzAle"
3773,"2011-09-20",3.9,"650 ml bottle from bevmo. Pours a cloudy yellow color with a small white head that quickly dissipates to a fine film. The aroma is rich with fruity wheat, bread and cloves. The taste is more of the same, lots of banana, sourdough bread and mild spices(cloves). The palate is full and creamy with lively carbonation. Finishes long and dry with a bit of tang. Overall: Great beer.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"
3773,"2011-09-17",3.5,"22 oz bottle @ redlight redlight.  banana and clove on the nose.  Pours an orange color with a dissipating white head.  Banana upfront with clove spiciness following, first sip i get traditional Bavarian flavors, second sip the hops kick in, grassy citrusy hops.  Not bad.","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
3773,"2011-09-17",3.7,"$4 in South Oregon.  Pours a lovely cloudy light oranged yellow color.  Nose is quite malty with hints of clove ice cream.  Flavor runs very Bavarian Hefe style with mild hints at banana and little bits of sweet cream somehow.  Most of the flavor is dominated by the clove aspect, which hits in the body and finishes out the beer, lingering heavily - more than your average Bavarian Hefe, but its kind of nice!  All in all, its good...could be a bit thicker in the body, but I like it!  Nice to see Lagunitas continually doing different things - AND keeping their price at $4 a 22oz!","Earth, Washington, USA","skoisirius"

3773,"2011-09-15",3.3,"22 oz. bomber.  Opaque, reddish orange pour with a medium offwhite head that dissipates.  Aroma of yeasty belgian esters, mild bread dough.  Yeasty belgian esters of clove, banana, bubblegum.  Flavor is mildly sweet, with a twang of belgian yeast, clove and bubblegum blend in with doughy malts.  A strong sweetness thats similar to donuts or pastry.  Medium bodied, average carbonation.   I feel like this beer is trying to get to something that it never really reaches.  It just of fizzles out in the runway.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
3773,"2011-09-15",3.8,"22oz bottle.  Pours a hazy golden orange with small bubbly head.  Nose is predominately sweet: banana, candied sugar, along with clove, pepper, and a hint of booze.  Flavor is more yeasty, spicy with banana and syrupy maltiness.  Thick, slightly sticky, not overwhelmingly carbonated, definitely bigger than I expected.","San Diego, California, USA","jlieber17"
3773,"2011-09-15",3.4,"Draught at Lagunitas Brewery.
Orange-amber with lace. Lemon and sweet orange aroma, with clove and wheat. Very sweet flavor, with orange, lightest banana, clove. Strong alcohol, with a silky, oily body. Packs a big punch but is a bit unrefined.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
3773,"2011-09-15",3.6,"22oz bottle from The Davis Beer Shoppe. The aroma is heavy on clove and banana yeast esters. Plenty of bubble gum is present, too. Light underlying tartness.  Mostly hazy honey colored body with a nice white head that is fairly strong. Starts sweet with bubble gum notes, before a little clove estery flavors take over in the middle. This takes on some dusty and husky wheat character later on. Light spicy character to finish with more underlying sweetness persisting.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
3773,"2011-09-14",3.6,"Bottle...  Poured hazy yellowish/orange with a white head.  Nose had loads of yeast phenols with clove, bananas, and other spices.  Thick body, loads of carbonation with notes of vanilla, wheat malts, sugary-bready malts, banana bread, candied sweetness, light fruits, yeast tanginess, cloves, and a phenolic finish. A little alcohol crept int but overall pretty smooth for the ABV.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
3773,"2011-09-12",3.7,"Hard to believe this hasnt been reviewed yet. On the brewerys website. Bottle from Belmont Station. Dont know what the Weissen spice is but its in the aroma, cotton candy, alcohol. Mild sourness in the flavor, lemon and peach, alcohol,a mild version of the chemical taste you get in malt liquors, and an edge of hops.Hazy warm yellow with insistent creamy white head. Chewy presence in the mouth, substantial.","Portland, Oregon, USA","raphael"
