4382,"2017-03-11",3.8,"Tap at FFF. Brown-black body, amber edges. Big beige head. An awesome black lager. Well brewed, fresh. Beastly US hop bite. Probably the best Black Lager Ive ever had...not so far removed from Black IPA. Wow. Hop forward. Thick.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
4382,"2016-04-12",3.7,"Opaque black with an ample creamy tan head. Big pine resin and grapefruit on the nose, trailed by some roast espresso notes. Light lingering molasses. Immediately bitter, again almost abrasively piney, very little sweetness at all. Acidic, medium body, chewy mouthfeel, light carbonation. Longer dry aftertaste. Good, not super well balanced.

4382,"2015-04-05",3.5,"4oz on tap at Country Boy. Black color. Ring of off-white khaki head. Leaves good, thicker ridges of lace. Up front, surprisingly hoppy. Kind of like a black IPA, but theres a bigger malt sweetness here. Less bitter than a black IPA. Great big earthy hop to it, though. Caramel, mild chocolate, touch of licorice. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, kind of soft, lighter carbonation. Kind of slick. An interesting, hoppy, black IPA -ish schwarzbier. A bit sweet in the finish, though.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
4382,"2015-04-03",3.8,"Vanilla cocoa aroma - fantastic. The taste almost holds up to the aroma. Chocolate and creamy. Thick pallette. Draft pour at bottom lounge. Overall another great FFF offering","Chicago, Illinois, USA","kaser"

4382,"2015-03-28",3.6,"Its cool, its darker with more malts. Still has a little kick to hit and the alcohol trails at the end. Sweet but still hoppy. Good pour and very smooth/ easy going down.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","Block"
4382,"2015-03-24",3.6,"Draft on tap at the brewpub (Munster, IN). Decided to go with everything that wasnt packaged for convenience sake. This one pours a blackish hazy hue, some darker accents in the middle trail out to a brownish glow on the edges, some decent carmelized glow with frothy beige head that is sizable, good retention and solid lacing throughout. Aromas show a distinct hoppy bitterness, earth and pine meet resin and toast, jabs of smoke, earth, florals hit the nose. Faint wafts of cocoa and carmelized malts cut in between a firmer hop assault. Initial shows a medium bodied, a distinct toasty smokey feel jabs at times, quickly moving to a potent hop bouquet. Florals and pine show some good bitterness, toast and carmelized malts cut in with a bit of caramel and sweeter malt girth supporting the middle. Backend is dry, bitter, smokey and jabs of bitter earth, coffee and bakers chocolate as we trail out. An odd style to begin with, this one shows more hop bite than expected overall in that true to form FFF fashion. Interesting, I kinda enjoyed this as far as it wasnt necessarily what I expected.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
4382,"2015-03-08",4.1,"Draft, strong hoppy aroma in first sniff. Notes of tropical fruit and chocolate. Chocolate and roasted malts really come forward in the flavor. Also, very pretty beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AndyReynolds"
4382,"2015-02-28",3.9,"On tap at Three Gloyds. Poured black with thick beige head. Aroma smokey resin hop. Light carb med bod. Smooth rich choc bitter fruit resin taste. Pretty good","New York, New York, USA","charule"
4382,"2015-02-19",3.5,"Draft to taster at FFF. Looks good; a translucent dark cola with foamy beige head. Smells malty and hoppy with notes of dark chocolate. More like a Black IPA than a Schwarzbier on the nose. Tastes like it smells with a bit of caramel as well. Mouthfeel in medium-bodied. Good, not great.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
4382,"2015-02-17",3.9,"half pint at the brewpub. Aroma is pine hops. Roasty malt. almost burnt coffee malt. Taste is hop heavy. Reminds me of some of the black IPAs years ago before everyone decided to pack them with rye. This beer brings me back to what made me fall in love with 3 Floyds 4 or so years ago. Take a style which isnt known for handfuls of hops and then hop the hell out if it, in a good way.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
