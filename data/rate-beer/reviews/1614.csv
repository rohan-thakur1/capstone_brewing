1614,"2012-07-09",3.6,"Aroma of musky melons. Fairly sweet and a bit salty. Some acidity in the middle. Tangible alcohol presence. Moderate/full bodied. Not the best sake in the world, but a good stand alone sake in the summer. Probably too strong to be paired with delicate tasting foods like sushi.","Wayne, Pennsylvania, USA","pilgrimoutlaw"
1614,"2012-03-21",3.2,"Mildly sweet aroma. Very cloudy white color. Quick sweet beginning with a alcohol bitter middle and finish.","Waterbury, Connecticut, USA","rocbyter"
1614,"2011-12-29",3.6,"Bottle shared at SakeOne.  Pours clear with some nice legs.  Aroma of rice and subtle flowers.  Super subtle.  The flavor is sweeter with mango and coconut cream.  The palate is sweet.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
1614,"2011-11-08",3.3,"Bottle.  Pours a milky yellowed and browned color.  Sort of looks like soy milk.  Big sweet rice up front, definite chalky notes, powdery.  Medium bodied, nice sweetness, a touch of banana.  Certainly a little bit of gritty chalkiness, but its very smooth and gentle.  Alcohol shows up quickly, warm and sweet, a bit more fruity banana esters and warm sweet rice pudding.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
1614,"2011-03-23",3.4,"Clear yellow tinted. Sweet rice and alcohol aroma. Floral sweet fruit and rice flour taste with a syrupy palate. Not bad.","Berkeley, California, USA","badlizard"
1614,"2010-04-27",3.1,"Glass, at Kabuki - Wakefield, RI. The aroma on this bustled with a little more warmth and yeast than I wanted. Poured clear and leggy, with a honey-tinted hint and some opalescence. Flavors were rich and rounded, but edge a little unclean and rubbery. Bright pear, cucumber, and rose, when not pushing the alcohol envelope. In many ways, unremarkable and maybe not something I would return to. Held a decent balance of sugar and alcohol, staying relatively crisp in the finish.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
1614,"2010-03-12",2.7,"The aroma is strong for a 14% with plenty of alcohol, rice, and grass. The appearance is clear yellow and still. The taste is like the aroma. It is sweet up front but dry near the end and quite mild. The palate is thin and watery. Overall a nice sake.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
1614,"2010-03-12",2.6,"its grassy that a bit thinish and yellow. it has a slightly dry palate with 
some raw coconut flavor. not bad","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
1614,"2009-06-15",3.5,"Bottle: Pours clear with mild legs. The nose is ripe with melon and anise and some light apple/pear notes. A touch of rice and koji in the nose but its subtle, more of a smooth and floral initial impression. The flavor has a mellow impact but noticable; a little chewy on the mouthfeel and a nice smooth dry flavor but not the best overall feel on the tongue. A brief finish and it stays rather drinkable, smooth and quaffable. Nice combination of elements going on with a very light alcohol note. Quite delicious for SakeOne, their house rice doesnt usually bode well for me save for their upper lineup. This was right up there and could nearly be in my top 10 american sakes. With the lightness in alcohol and aroma and the heartiness of the body; this would make an ideal candidate for a gently warmed premium sake.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1614,"2009-03-24",3.4,"Cold.....A clear body with a yellowish twinge to it.  A clearly floral aroma with hints of subtle sweetness.  Flavor had nice floral note to it, but it was balanced out by sweet grain notes.  Finish was full and alcohol presence was minimal.","New York, USA","crazyvin"
1614,"2008-11-18",3.6,"I’m tasting this cold. Clear and yellowish. Aroma is nice; warm, floral and fruity. Taste is floral and nutty. Some hibiscus, orange blossom and almond notes. Rice flavor is kinda strong and hard to get used to. Very thick mouthfeel, kinda oily. All in all, it’s not bad. I’m wondering if I should try this warm...","Berkeley, California, USA","Aquilo"
1614,"2008-10-06",3.3,"Pour is clear with a faint yellowish hue...smell is lightly sweet and nutty with some sort of astringent note...taste is sweet...not much alcohol present, but not a lot of flavor either....some wet rice sweet flavor, light notes of almond paste and honeysuckle...finish is lingeringly sweet and perfumey...","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"
