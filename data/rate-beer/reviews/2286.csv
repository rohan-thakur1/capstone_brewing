Great notes of soft sweet bread, date,vanilla, burnt sugar, grape skins, spicy bourbon character and wet wood. Boozy finish with some underlying toasted nuts and coconut.

2286,"2014-04-27",4.6,"22 ounce bottle thanks to a buddy of mine stopping by. Wow! Finally get to try this one. With all the talk of it being infected, we were both a little worried, but this bottle must have been lucky, because it was awesome! Pours a somewhat hazy dark copper color with a velvety head of khaki foam. The aroma has notes of dark fruits, figs, dates, candied fruits, vanilla, coconut, oak. The taste is more of the same with the barrel character and the dark fruits of the base beer working seamlessly together. Thick body with soft carbonation. Just an overall great beer.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"

2286,"2014-03-19",4.4,"HMOG 2014. Westmeister you dog. This was exceptional, incredible, smooth, and aged perfectly in the barrell and the bottle. So smooth with vanilla and wood and whiskey melding in with the chocolate and roasty malt. A little bit of spice pepper on the bak end as it warms a bit. I am still thinking about this one days later.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
2286,"2014-03-16",4.4,"HMOG 2014. Call it the excitement around the bottle, call it a still awake palate, or maybe the fact that I brought the beer, but this was amazing. Great nose of vanilla, nonoverpowering whiskey, oak, sweet ripe fruits. Taste was a decadent and beautiful mix of a great american whiskey or that age (in a fridge) did it well, but this was amazing. If you for some reason have one of the 300 bottles, drink it now. Share it. I know the 15 people who had some really dug the shit out of it.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"

Palate...similar to the nose, up front, then a boozy hint comes forth as does a somewhat wine like note. The funk is there too but not as much on the nose.
