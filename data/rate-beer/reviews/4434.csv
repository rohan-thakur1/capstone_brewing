4434,"2017-05-21",4.1,"2015/2016 vintage, had in 2017. Hazy, dirtied orange, tiny bit of off-white foam. Nose has rustic white wine funk, fermenting ""pulpy"" orchard fruit, like plums, sure, but it makes me think of ripe cherry plums rather than that. Chinese plum, faint yellow cherries, oaky vanilla, mold, salt, green hay. The funk takes center stage in the taste, with a sharp sourness, like lemon juice, with mild vinegary notes. Dirty barrel, white wine gone bad, mixed crunchy herbs, the regular lambic funk, but with a really nice twist in the end. A nice fruity, juicy undertone, that makes me think of Chinese plum and some nice grapefruit flesh, too. Aftertaste is pretty dry, but has lingering oak stave and sour funk. Medium to light body, spritzy carbonation. Great lambic with subtle notes from the added plums, but theyÂ’re somewhat special. Not bringing a lot in the mix, but the lambicÂ’s already pretty complex as it is. Great!","Bucharest, ROMANIA","dcmchew"

Head retention is good, and thereÂ’s not much lacing at all. The brew smells like plums, funk, earthiness, and vinegar. I could really smell the plum fruitiness as soon as I opened the bottle.

4434,"2016-10-02",3.6,"375 bottle (dated 2015/2016) from one of the SteveÂ’s liquor stores in Madison, WI, served a little below cellar temp in a New Glarus flute. Small-to-moderate off-white head dies quickly above the lightly bubbly, cloudy pale amber body...nose of horse blanket, dogwood, light yeast, and, as it warms more, sweet-tart plums; itÂ’s quite pleasant and initially sharp but after a few minutes it has weakened too much and doesnÂ’t come off as all that expressive....flavor is faintly sweet and quite tart at the front, growing strongly sour and very dry at the finish, strongly acidic, and peppery-sharp on the end-palate...full-bodied, lively carbonation despite the minimal head and no pop to the cork...while this is pretty tart and stinging at the finish I suspect some of that actually comes from the bitterness in the plum skins, or perhaps from hops, as the brett character is relatively mild. ItÂ’s a nice enough beer but I was hoping for more I guess - not often I get to have a ""new"" lambic around here - and IÂ’ll have to try to find an older bottle, or hang onto another of this vintage for a year or two and see how it progresses.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

4434,"2016-08-11",3.8,"This beer has had a very  long journey to finally be consumed by me. Mcberko gifted this 375mL c&c bottle to me a little while ago as a thank you for letting him crash at my house. I told him it wasnÂ’t a big deal and I didnÂ’t need beer in return but he was very giving.Thank you, Matt.  I had previously drank this beer but wouldnÂ’t splurge on another bottle to rate. Even Andrew from Seattle wanted me to rate this beer. Another overly kind RBian. ThatÂ’s how it got into my hands but the journey was much longer. 
Taking a step back, this beer was a blend of 4 different breweries from Belgium that were all sent to Tilquin. After some months it was placed on a ship and made a voyage to, my guess, the east coast of Canada. Afterward, it made it or all the way to Vancouver, BC where Matt purchased it. To pay his way onto the underground RB railroad, he smuggled - under the cover of night I assume and facing potential treason charges - this bottle across the border and brought it to the Emerald City. You would think the journey ends there but that is just the beginning.
I had all intentions of drinking it in Seattle but just couldnÂ’t get to it. Even at the last tasting, the day before I moved out, this was sitting in the fridge. Yet, it could not be consumed. So, this beer started on a cross country moving trip. Funny enough i was joined by the DIPA rating machine himself,  mcberko. He joined me on the trip until we reached SLC, Utah. Now when you travel with a real life ticker, or dink rater as they are known in Canadia, there is little time for anything but new beer. In Denver I saw notalush but we meet up at a brewery. I gave him Logsdon and a brett beer from Red Rock. Through the Midwest I had too many new beers I wanted to drink, particularly in Kansas and Missouri where I had to catch up on my old rating-grounds. Even saw csbosox but he isnÂ’t active and was drinking wine as I was sample Free State beers in the Olathe Whole Foods. Apparently, there is a new WF in the KC area, which I didnÂ’t know and accidentally went to the wrong place. Gave him a Blvd Saison brett crowler, apparently I gift brett beer only. Made it to Cincinnati and even saw Pruf and his family for about 90 min. But wanted to share beer he hasnÂ’t had yet. He on the other hand shared 1 good beer and 3 shitty ones. Next stop is Morgantown, WV. As any RBIian will tell you, when you get a chance to tick WV beer you donÂ’t take it for granted. And now IÂ’m a finally at my new home in Maryland drinking this beer. 
It seems i live in a bit of a craft beer desert. The liquor stores close at 9 pm and donÂ’t have too much craft anyway and definitely donÂ’t have singles. IÂ’ve amassed a decent amount of beers throughout the trip but most are earmarked for something. So, here I am, sitting naked in my new big tub, eating fruit salad that was given to us by our new neighbors, and finally drinking this beer. What a journey it has been and how many wonderful people I got to see on it. (And I didnÂ’t even get to mention all the wonderful people that arenÂ’t RBians like Rach of mcberko fame, Joe in Denver, Christina and Jean in KC, in-laws in StL, Lora in Cincy, minus Bill, and my wonderful and patient wife Abbey who gave birth to a beautiful 2-month old darling named Lorenna).","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam surrounds the orange murk.
-Carbonation is relatively low.
-This is very tasty and rustic, but cannot reach the heights of their Gueuze, for me, in terms of refinement and complexity.
-Prices for this in North America are absurdly high.

Has a very sour, tart nose with fruity hints in it. I honestly canÂ’t tell for sure that I am actually getting plum, but I try to imagine that :). If so, its reminding me of the pulp of unripe plums, with stone hints to it, blended with leather, old cheese and hay.

Unexpected low carbonated with a very sour, dry, citric foundation. Underneath the dominant, acidic tartness, refreshing sour notes become recognizable, with a subtle, lovely hint of fermented fruit to it. The fruitiness itself is surprisingly sour, of unripe plums and green apple, which is very soft on tongue, while the brett acidity dries out the palate. Not too fruity, compared to the sour aspect of the beer, a subtle addition.
During the finish, acidity reaches its peak, overwhelming the fruit flavor completely, leaving back a slick, tremendous sourness.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Pours a very cloudy, murky, orange-brown with some light red highlights and a small, thin, slightly off-white head that exhibits poor retention. No lacing and faint legs.

Plum lambic -- a first for me. I guess itÂ’s Dom Perignon of pruno. This one pours a hazy coral peach with a white head and lots of floaters. The aroma is a mild sour with...with raspberry koolaid. Or is it tropical punch? In any case, itÂ’s definitely koolaid and that totally cracks me up.
 After a few minutes of enjoying the subtle humor of the aroma, I move on to the first sip. Wow! After the aroma that had me almost worried about syrup sweeteners, the flavor, while easy drinking, is surprisingly legit. Plenty of leather, plenty of funk. Not aggressive at all, just truly delicious. I really like this one. A nine for flavor. The bottle races by all too quickly, and thankfully the koolaid aroma disappears almost by magic as I go forward, leaving behind a delightful wild lambic.

Lots of that Cantillon-like funk with horseblanket, sulphur, light farm animal poop. The plum adds a touch of sweetness but mostly dry plum skin and tart, acids that are mostly lost amidst the critter-induced acids. Very good strength to it and no flaws or alcohol.Very, near bracingly sour. Tons of brett acids tarten up the softly sour lactic base while the plum juice seems quite tart/sour as well. As in the aroma, itÂ’s tough to pull those acids out from the rest of it, though the dark fruit flavor, almost black currant-like is certainly noticeable. Nice restraint on the fruit. Much lighter on the fruit flavor than a Cantillon fruit lambic. More along the lines of 3F Oude Kriek. More Cantillon -like flavors abound, with leather, cheese, some light acetic acids and a delicious lactic finish to wrap it all up.

Taking the first sip I note a mild floral flavor with a tart plum and citrus taste. The flavour profile has considerable less must and dust notes that the aroma with a sweeter flavour than most lambic beers. So far I note that Quetsche is incredibly well balanced and although not the sourest or funkiest of lambics a great brew.

4434,"2013-10-01",4.4,"Batch 2, 375 mL bottle poured into a Hill Farmstead wine glass. 

A- Pours a hazy red (plum skin colored?) with a thin layer of off white head that quickly fades to a thin coating around the top with some larger bubbles circling the edge of the glass. 

S- Tons of sour fruit that remind me of lemon peel, plum, apricot, and a touch of sour cherries along with a dank, musty fungal aroma. Over the top acidity, mostly lactic, although a touch of acetic on the nose as well. 

T- Up front there is a ton of stone fruit (plum, sour cherry, apricot) mixed in with orange zest, lemon tartness, and some brett aroma following up the assault of fruit flavor. On the back end, the acidity that was apparent on the nose comes through and meshes some big brett barnyard. 

M- Low mouthfeel with lower carbonation, as expected for the style. It has a great drying effect on the end, and honestly I feel that the way this beer feels is the biggest highlight besides the amazing fruit flavors. The dry finish isnÂ’t over the top like some beers, but it lends itself in convincing you to take another taste. 

O- Glad I got to try this one fresh, it really leans toward the huge stone fruit flavor and acidity over the brett barnyard, and while I obviously havenÂ’t tried this one aged, I think the fruit really shines in itÂ’s current form. I canÂ’t see it improving much- absolutely great right now.","","justforrazors"

A: Pours a murky brown color with some amber edges from the light. A thin white head forms on the pour and recedes to a thin ring.

S: Tart and slightly funky. Bursts of plum skins, some fruity berry flesh and light oak. The oaky is woody and slightly sweet. Some grape skins as well.

T: A little puckering with some sourness that hits the back of the throat. Oaky with a slight malty sweetness to it. A little red wine grape to it with a nice funky undertone.

M: Low carbonation. Not quite flat, but pretty close. Tart finish. Light body.

O: Despite the low carbonation this was still an enjoyable beer. It had just enough carbonation to keep the body lively and light across the tongue.

4434,"2013-09-15",4.3,"375 mL bottle from Conn Ave Wine & Spirits in DC. Pours a murky orange gumwood color with minimal bubbly white head. Nose holds balanced plum and vinous fruit tones mixing with an earthy, lightly lemony funk. The palate is much more complex, with gorgeous plum, prune, unripe peach, tannic acidity, light citric tang and basement funk. Palate is captivating; definitely not nearly as aggressive as most fresh Cantillon fruit lambics, with a finish that is soft, almost caressing, though still acidic. The middle of the mouthfeel harkens a bit towards Drie Fonteinen, with touches of quenching dryness remaining secondary to that musty cobweb and wet basement quality so seldom found in fruit lambics, moreso in top-tier gueuzes. The fruit hits up front and at the end, which strikes me as a very excellent quality. Pierre Tilquin has created a fruit lambic so distinct from the traditionally dominant blenders/brewers, and it excels. Superb.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

4434,"2013-08-21",4.2,"A steady pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a fat-one-finger thick, pale tan colored head; despite the reduced thickness, the head is quite persistent, and leaves a relatively thick, layered lacing on the sides of the glass. The beer is a murky amber color that shows a light read stained, light-gold hue when held up to the light. The nose smells tart and quite fruity at first blush. Musty, woody, lightly spicy, and floral notes also play a role. Specific aromas of light urea, sweet floral notes leaning towards carnations, perhaps a touch of rose, definite floral plum, and even some peppery floral notes add to the blossoming expression found here. Dried wildflowers, dried hay, and a touch of grain like character are found in the long finish.

Quite a bit more sour tasting than the aroma might have suggested; this has a bracing acidity that is mostly lactic in character, but whose complexity seems to be boosted by a fruit derived acidity too. This is quite effervescent, and definitely light bodied, which suggest at a champagne like texture, but this does have more body than a champagne, with a touch of lactic slickness and some touches of residual grain body. The finish is quite dry, definitely acidic, a touch spicy, with a musty phenolic note, and with quite a bit of wood flavors. The floral and fruit character is a bit reduced from the aroma, but still contributes noticeable spicy floral notes, touches of something like carnations, and a general fruitiness that could lean towards floral plum like notes, and perhaps even some tart, astringent, dark berry like notes. The long finish almost has a strawberry note, perhaps it is guava, or papaya, but a definite interesting fruit edge to the flavor. As the beer warms up it gets quite a bit more fruity, and in complex, unexpected ways (tropical).

This is a pretty fantastic Fruit Lambic. The plums contribute more of a general, though quite noticeable, fruitiness rather than being as specific as say a Frambois, or a Kriek, but it still really works quite well; it makes this a bit more Gueuze like in some ways, which is certainly not a bad thing. There is lots of wood, lots of fruit, omnipresent sourness, and a solid funkiness, all of which make for a nicely balanced beer that I am quite enjoying; much better than I expected even, Tilquin is really doing things right.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

A - Pours a beautiful hazy pink grapefruit body that just screams pulpy fruit juice. A fingers worth of bone white foam fades into a thick edging that lasts quite a while. Swirling creates some gorgeous lacing but retention is low here. I was told the 750Â’s carbed up a bit more than the 375Â’s but this is looking pretty damn active to me.

S - Lemons, hay, funky cheese, and some stone fruit. The plums are very subtle here but they provide just enough fruitiness to make this stand out from the normal gueuze. Very brett heavy.

T - Super mouth puckering sour. Lemons, hay, plenty of funk, and some woody oak barrel. The plums are present in a light stone fruit juiciness but seem to be squashed out by the huge sourness. Its incredibly tasty, its just not as fruit forward as other fruit lambics tend to be. In fact itÂ’s extremely gueuze like. Mouth feel is crisp and lively.

4434,"2013-07-12",4.1,"Pours an red-orangish brown color. Probably a bit too red for a wood stain, but it would be a bright cherry pine, kinda garish, really. No real head. WeÂ’re in lambic country, so normal rules do not apply, not that IÂ’m much of a believe in appearance ratings. The aroma is plum jam on top of mild vinegar and gueuze funk, but the fruit is dominant. The plum smell is on the apricot end of the plum world. It definitely smells like plums, but thereÂ’s a fair bit of variation within plums. This beer smells more like what is sold as fresh French prunes, around here, rather than the juicier, sweet-tart Santa Rosa plum that I more closely associate with the fruit, though I have no idea what Tilquin actually used, of course. The funk is mildly cheesy with some nice horse blanket tendencies bouncing around (itÂ’s been too long since I used ""horse blanket"" in a review). The taste is light to medium tart with more of that fruit flavor. ItÂ’s still relatively sweet and a tad lacking in flavor for what I expect from a plum sour, but I donÂ’t mean that as a knock. ItÂ’s just a tad different than expected. The fruit flavor is refined and melds nicely with the tartness. ThereÂ’s a big lemony note. The vinegar tartness is actually pretty restrained, and thereÂ’s none of that back-of-the-throat burn that many American sours suffer from. Tilquin does a magnificent job balancing the flavors, showing off that quality lambic brewer touch. Carbonation is normal. Mouthfeel is a tad slick with fruitiness. Moderate pucker. I quite enjoyed this beer. ItÂ’s not a dramatic beer, but it has a lovely fruit flavor and oozes lambic complexity and refinement.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Acidity is medium and about as strong as the tannins. Medium funk, wet hay. Juicy. Low carbonation. Mild cheesiness. Lots of tannin, thicker body for a lambic.

Thanks to Bruce for sharing this beer which was one of the finest opened all night. A truly top notch lambic in all aspects I would have been able to drink it all night if not for a number of other distractions. I look forward to tracking down a few more Tilquin bottles in Belgium later this year.

Aroma / Appearance - The pour was the color of grapefruit juice with a icy white head. Sweaty gym socks, strawberries, and light chocolate are the main centerpieces of that traditionally dry bretty feel that comes from a true Belgian lambic.

Flavor / Palate - Almost immediately the vinegary sour texture attacks the palate. Like sips of paint thinner it scrapes away all the previous beers until all that remains is a fruity blend of vinegar. Intense from start to finish I can almost still taste it now. Based on this sample I might have to give Tilquin more attention when I get home.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Aroma is fruity, funky and if you can smell sour then that as well. Wonderfully tart and with a tanginess and fruitiness that you get from something like a good olÂ’ English fruit crumble that uses something like rhubarb or similar to really tart it up, but I am not suggesting this has a rhubarb flavour, it doesnÂ’t but the plums have that nice tart, tangy, challenging fruity bite, and I can get them in here.

4434,"2013-04-22",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 19, 2014 BATCH 2: 75cl bottle at Tour de Geuze 2013. Shared with Mathieu87.
I had the last edition of the Quetsche last year (didnÂ’t write ratings down then, so canÂ’t really rate that though), but in my memory, last years edition = BATCH 1 was WAY BETTER. I also drank the beer when it was released just for some days, so it canÂ’t be that, really wonder where it went wrong? The beer than didnÂ’t really shout out the plum this much, it was more like a very very good geuze, but now it has the plum overruling the rest of the taste.
Appearance: reminded me of grapefruit juice, little to no foam.
Nose: grapefruit noticeable again, sugar, sweetness.
Taste: grapefruits again, little to no sourness, some red fruits, plums are very noticeable as well, and quite overruling... Someone I was sharing this bottle with, said that this reminded him a lot of Â’plum pieÂ’ more than a geuze...

Sour as youÂ’ll get but with a lovely soft after taste. The plums work so well with the lambic you wonder why we donÂ’t use this fruit more often.","Tervuren, BELGIUM","DeclanT"
4434,"2013-04-21",3.8,"Bottle @ In de Verzekering Tegen de Grote Dorst, Belgium. Pours a rhubarb-ish dark cloudy pink body with a medium white head. Nose is plum, tart lactic tones, lemon and stomach acid notes and hints of barnyard funk. Taste is sweet plum up front, then lactic acidic sourness comes in with barnyard funk in the end with some grapefruit and lemon. Very nice, with high carbonation and medium body. A fresh and thirst-quenching fruit lambic of the original kind.

4434,"2013-01-25",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 28, 2013 The other morning I was in a hurry to grab a bottle for brunch with my wife... went down into the cellar looking for a 2011-2012 Oude Gueuze Tilquin and mistakenly grab this instead.  Cracked it open with some raisin challah french toast and proceeded to enjoy it without realizing what I had done.  Two days later, I am back in my cellar looking for this to bring to a tasting--bam it hits me--that nice fruity beverage from brunch the other morning wasnÂ’t a great batch of TilquinÂ’s Oude Gueuze... it was the Oude Quetsche.  After some mild embarassment that my palate hadnÂ’t noticed my error earlier, I realized why this beer is so good.  It adds just a little bit of fruity plum to the Oude Gueuze and improves on the product.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"

4434,"2012-11-17",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2013 Zythos Bierfestival 2012, Leuven, Belgium. Big thanks to Sebletitje for this. Sebastian ROCKS IT as usual. It pours opaque looking copper with loose tan head. The aroma offers up faint musty prunes and modest sour and tart notes moving toward some woody notes. The taste begins tart and moves into sour notes nuanced by vinegar and fruit skin like tannins. It then heads into a dry finish thinly ringed around the edges by a light sense of some sort of vague fruitiness. Could use a bit more prune influence in the taste. Good stuff nonetheless. CanÂ’t wait to try one with a bit more cellar time. Lovely brew. IÂ’m really enjoying this brewery.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

4434,"2012-11-07",4.2,"Small, but relatively stable yellowish-beige head over fully cloudy orange-ochre beer. Farmyard odour, hard leatherfat, citrus (lemon especially); only very faintly fruity, all the more gueuze-y. Sharp lemony flavour; flowery, fruitzeste, again - if restrained - leatherfataroma as a flavour. Finish is rather abrupt, just the lemony sourness tangentially fleeting. Sharpish, very tart, dry-out effect to quite some extent. Maybe medium bodied still. Phenomenally refreshing. Just as experienced with other (non-lambic) quetche beers, thereÂ’s not a very distinct, recognisable fruitflavour. What remains is a superb lambicbeer... bettering all the time @ Tilquin.

The taste is Granny Smith apple, tart pithy lemon, plum skin, moderate acidity, mouth-puckering tartness, red grape skin and floral aspect, with a tart finish. The fairly high initial tartness smooths out to a more fruity finish. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Plums are not in your face....so to speak!

4434,"2012-09-01",4.2,"Rating based on what I see as some of the many evolutionary-stages of this beer.  My rating is based on the final version and inputs about its evolution over the last 6 months. First sample was kindly offered at ZBF by Pierre and offered a nice introspect into the early stage of the Questche. My second version was sampled during the Tilquin open doors in May 2012 with a nice panel of brewers weighing in on the matter, and the third, and final stage, was sampled on September 1st 2012 from a bottle kindly shared by Tderoeck at Tilquin.
Couleur est un subtile mÃ©lange alternant un orangÃ©-ambre et un acajou fruitÃ© qui selon moi Ã©tait plus prÃ©sent dans les versions antÃ©rieures. Le col est Ã©pais prÃ©sentant une belle rÃ©sistance dans des tons beiges.
ArÃ´me et cÂ’est lÃ  que mon opinion va changer, prÃ©sente ce changement de par un profile fruitÃ© sucrÃ© qui sÂ’attÃ©nue pas mal en lÂ’espace de qcq mois, autant en mars la prune se faisait bien plus prÃ©sente, ici elle est toujours notable mais avec un clair bouquet de gueuze qui laisse une balance entre les lambics, levure et la prune. 
Palais est agrÃ©ablement fruitÃ© avec pour moi un profile fruitÃ© qui vient plus titiller la fin de bouche et ce profile somptueux de prune tout en alternant un cÃ´tÃ© sec/poussiÃ©reux moyennement aigre-acidulÃ© de la gueuze avec ce cÃ´tÃ© houblon Ã  cru. En mars, je notais un cÃ´tÃ© fruitÃ© noir nettement plus en avant, qui ici rÃ©trocÃ¨de un peu tout en restant agrÃ©able. Palais reste bien pÃ©tillant venant touchÃ© le haut du palais sur un cÃ´tÃ© moyennement Ã©picÃ©/fruitÃ©.

JÂ’arrÃªte ici car je nÂ’ai pas vraiment pour habitude dÂ’Ã©crire autant sur une biÃ¨re. 

Au final, une biÃ¨re qui me plaÃ®t, Ã©normÃ©ment de par sa complexitÃ© mais aussi de par son goÃ»t Ã©volutif qui en qcq mois montre dÃ©jÃ  de subtiles signes de changement. Pour ma part, mon avis reste mitigÃ© mais positif, tout comme la Zwanze 2011 que jÂ’avais pu goÃ»ter avec qcq mois en bouteille, je trouvais une petite prÃ©fÃ©rence Ã  ce profile fruitÃ© sucrÃ© qui Ã©tait plus en avant au palais mais qui ici aussi reste prÃ©sent aprÃ¨s qcq mois. Une biÃ¨re Ã  mettre en cave et Ã  revisiter dans les annÃ©es Ã  venir.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

Second time we opened a bottle at Â’t Schooltje with Carlo and Urbain Nose is rather mediocre, slightly citrus, some exotic fruits. Taste is nice sourness, prunes are not very prominent. In fact itÂ’s more a really good geuze, with a little bit more fruitiness to it. Good job. Looking forward to upcoming batches of this.

Update: I really donÂ’t get why the first and second batch are under the same rating. Those are two totally different beers. First one was a real complex geuze with a nice hint of the plums. Now itÂ’s just liquid plum pie... I donÂ’t get it...","Brussels, BELGIUM","Mathieu87"
