4434,"2017-05-21",4.1,"2015/2016 vintage, had in 2017. Hazy, dirtied orange, tiny bit of off-white foam. Nose has rustic white wine funk, fermenting ""pulpy"" orchard fruit, like plums, sure, but it makes me think of ripe cherry plums rather than that. Chinese plum, faint yellow cherries, oaky vanilla, mold, salt, green hay. The funk takes center stage in the taste, with a sharp sourness, like lemon juice, with mild vinegary notes. Dirty barrel, white wine gone bad, mixed crunchy herbs, the regular lambic funk, but with a really nice twist in the end. A nice fruity, juicy undertone, that makes me think of Chinese plum and some nice grapefruit flesh, too. Aftertaste is pretty dry, but has lingering oak stave and sour funk. Medium to light body, spritzy carbonation. Great lambic with subtle notes from the added plums, but theyre somewhat special. Not bringing a lot in the mix, but the lambics already pretty complex as it is. Great!","Bucharest, ROMANIA","dcmchew"

Head retention is good, and theres not much lacing at all. The brew smells like plums, funk, earthiness, and vinegar. I could really smell the plum fruitiness as soon as I opened the bottle.

4434,"2016-10-02",3.6,"375 bottle (dated 2015/2016) from one of the Steves liquor stores in Madison, WI, served a little below cellar temp in a New Glarus flute. Small-to-moderate off-white head dies quickly above the lightly bubbly, cloudy pale amber body...nose of horse blanket, dogwood, light yeast, and, as it warms more, sweet-tart plums; its quite pleasant and initially sharp but after a few minutes it has weakened too much and doesnt come off as all that expressive....flavor is faintly sweet and quite tart at the front, growing strongly sour and very dry at the finish, strongly acidic, and peppery-sharp on the end-palate...full-bodied, lively carbonation despite the minimal head and no pop to the cork...while this is pretty tart and stinging at the finish I suspect some of that actually comes from the bitterness in the plum skins, or perhaps from hops, as the brett character is relatively mild. Its a nice enough beer but I was hoping for more I guess - not often I get to have a ""new"" lambic around here - and Ill have to try to find an older bottle, or hang onto another of this vintage for a year or two and see how it progresses.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

4434,"2016-08-11",3.8,"This beer has had a very  long journey to finally be consumed by me. Mcberko gifted this 375mL c&c bottle to me a little while ago as a thank you for letting him crash at my house. I told him it wasnt a big deal and I didnt need beer in return but he was very giving.Thank you, Matt.  I had previously drank this beer but wouldnt splurge on another bottle to rate. Even Andrew from Seattle wanted me to rate this beer. Another overly kind RBian. Thats how it got into my hands but the journey was much longer. 
Taking a step back, this beer was a blend of 4 different breweries from Belgium that were all sent to Tilquin. After some months it was placed on a ship and made a voyage to, my guess, the east coast of Canada. Afterward, it made it or all the way to Vancouver, BC where Matt purchased it. To pay his way onto the underground RB railroad, he smuggled - under the cover of night I assume and facing potential treason charges - this bottle across the border and brought it to the Emerald City. You would think the journey ends there but that is just the beginning.
I had all intentions of drinking it in Seattle but just couldnt get to it. Even at the last tasting, the day before I moved out, this was sitting in the fridge. Yet, it could not be consumed. So, this beer started on a cross country moving trip. Funny enough i was joined by the DIPA rating machine himself,  mcberko. He joined me on the trip until we reached SLC, Utah. Now when you travel with a real life ticker, or dink rater as they are known in Canadia, there is little time for anything but new beer. In Denver I saw notalush but we meet up at a brewery. I gave him Logsdon and a brett beer from Red Rock. Through the Midwest I had too many new beers I wanted to drink, particularly in Kansas and Missouri where I had to catch up on my old rating-grounds. Even saw csbosox but he isnt active and was drinking wine as I was sample Free State beers in the Olathe Whole Foods. Apparently, there is a new WF in the KC area, which I didnt know and accidentally went to the wrong place. Gave him a Blvd Saison brett crowler, apparently I gift brett beer only. Made it to Cincinnati and even saw Pruf and his family for about 90 min. But wanted to share beer he hasnt had yet. He on the other hand shared 1 good beer and 3 shitty ones. Next stop is Morgantown, WV. As any RBIian will tell you, when you get a chance to tick WV beer you dont take it for granted. And now Im a finally at my new home in Maryland drinking this beer. 
It seems i live in a bit of a craft beer desert. The liquor stores close at 9 pm and dont have too much craft anyway and definitely dont have singles. Ive amassed a decent amount of beers throughout the trip but most are earmarked for something. So, here I am, sitting naked in my new big tub, eating fruit salad that was given to us by our new neighbors, and finally drinking this beer. What a journey it has been and how many wonderful people I got to see on it. (And I didnt even get to mention all the wonderful people that arent RBians like Rach of mcberko fame, Joe in Denver, Christina and Jean in KC, in-laws in StL, Lora in Cincy, minus Bill, and my wonderful and patient wife Abbey who gave birth to a beautiful 2-month old darling named Lorenna).","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

Lambic funk pierces oranges and juicy plums in this balanced, bubbly example.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam surrounds the orange murk.
-Carbonation is relatively low.
-This is very tasty and rustic, but cannot reach the heights of their Gueuze, for me, in terms of refinement and complexity.
-Prices for this in North America are absurdly high.

Dark orange, dense hazy body, with a small, creamy, white head.

Has a very sour, tart nose with fruity hints in it. I honestly cant tell for sure that I am actually getting plum, but I try to imagine that :). If so, its reminding me of the pulp of unripe plums, with stone hints to it, blended with leather, old cheese and hay.

Unexpected low carbonated with a very sour, dry, citric foundation. Underneath the dominant, acidic tartness, refreshing sour notes become recognizable, with a subtle, lovely hint of fermented fruit to it. The fruitiness itself is surprisingly sour, of unripe plums and green apple, which is very soft on tongue, while the brett acidity dries out the palate. Not too fruity, compared to the sour aspect of the beer, a subtle addition.
During the finish, acidity reaches its peak, overwhelming the fruit flavor completely, leaving back a slick, tremendous sourness.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Taste is puckery and earthy lemon with red grape skins and yellow plum. Long sour finish. I like this a lot but the fruit is a bit too subtle and it doesnt quite have the balance of, say, Cantillons fruit beers. Lemon-lime bomb on the finish.

Flavor is moderately fruity with a bit of plum character. Moderately strong acidity with a lot of lemon and citrus and a lighter acetic character. Medium light oak notes with moderately strong barnyard funk with a touch of an herbal quality. Light plum notes in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium low carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a pretty nice fruited lambic with an interesting fruit character. Nice barnyard complexity, but it could use more carbonation. Really nice acid complexity too.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Plum lambic -- a first for me. I guess its Dom Perignon of pruno. This one pours a hazy coral peach with a white head and lots of floaters. The aroma is a mild sour with...with raspberry koolaid. Or is it tropical punch? In any case, its definitely koolaid and that totally cracks me up.
 After a few minutes of enjoying the subtle humor of the aroma, I move on to the first sip. Wow! After the aroma that had me almost worried about syrup sweeteners, the flavor, while easy drinking, is surprisingly legit. Plenty of leather, plenty of funk. Not aggressive at all, just truly delicious. I really like this one. A nine for flavor. The bottle races by all too quickly, and thankfully the koolaid aroma disappears almost by magic as I go forward, leaving behind a delightful wild lambic.

Lots of that Cantillon-like funk with horseblanket, sulphur, light farm animal poop. The plum adds a touch of sweetness but mostly dry plum skin and tart, acids that are mostly lost amidst the critter-induced acids. Very good strength to it and no flaws or alcohol.Very, near bracingly sour. Tons of brett acids tarten up the softly sour lactic base while the plum juice seems quite tart/sour as well. As in the aroma, its tough to pull those acids out from the rest of it, though the dark fruit flavor, almost black currant-like is certainly noticeable. Nice restraint on the fruit. Much lighter on the fruit flavor than a Cantillon fruit lambic. More along the lines of 3F Oude Kriek. More Cantillon -like flavors abound, with leather, cheese, some light acetic acids and a delicious lactic finish to wrap it all up.

A - Pours turgid purplish orange with a nice one finer tall white head, quickly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small streaks of lace down the sides of the glass.


S - Smells of mild barnyard funk, light basement must, dulled jammy plums, dash of red wine vinegar and earthy oak. Solid all around nose.


T - Starts off much like the nose with the funk, must and jammy plums mixing together to form the base. Hints of oak, vinegar, fruit skin and light lactic sourness. Finish is pretty dry, lingering long after the finish.


M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Dry, crisp feel from start to finish, bit of sweetness creeping in toward the end of each sip.

So far I note that Quetsche is incredibly well balanced and although not the sourest or funkiest of lambics a great brew.

4434,"2013-10-01",4.4,"Batch 2, 375 mL bottle poured into a Hill Farmstead wine glass. 

A- Pours a hazy red (plum skin colored?) with a thin layer of off white head that quickly fades to a thin coating around the top with some larger bubbles circling the edge of the glass. 

S- Tons of sour fruit that remind me of lemon peel, plum, apricot, and a touch of sour cherries along with a dank, musty fungal aroma. Over the top acidity, mostly lactic, although a touch of acetic on the nose as well. 

T- Up front there is a ton of stone fruit (plum, sour cherry, apricot) mixed in with orange zest, lemon tartness, and some brett aroma following up the assault of fruit flavor. On the back end, the acidity that was apparent on the nose comes through and meshes some big brett barnyard. 

M- Low mouthfeel with lower carbonation, as expected for the style. It has a great drying effect on the end, and honestly I feel that the way this beer feels is the biggest highlight besides the amazing fruit flavors. The dry finish isnt over the top like some beers, but it lends itself in convincing you to take another taste. 

O- Glad I got to try this one fresh, it really leans toward the huge stone fruit flavor and acidity over the brett barnyard, and while I obviously havent tried this one aged, I think the fruit really shines in its current form. I cant see it improving much- absolutely great right now.","","justforrazors"

4434,"2013-09-19",4.4,"Bottled, BB 29/01/2023, so 2013 batch, large sample. Hazy amber color, short lasting off-white head. Aroma has typical gueuze features, barnyard, tartness, etc. Some soft plums are present, but I wouldnt have guessed that without knowing. It does give the lambic that little bit of extra and the wonderful balance does the rest. In flavor there is a bit more of fruit present, besides the sourness. Again, superb balance between citric and lactic notes. Wow, truly great stuff.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
4434,"2013-09-19",4.0,"@Malting Pot. Comparée à la Gueuze à lancienne, jai préféré cette dégustation car le jus de prune atténue lacidité de la bière ( qui est quand même pas mal). Du coup elle se déguste plus facilement. Au nez, lacidité pique les narines adoucies par les saveurs de prunes discrètes; ce qui est une surprise pour une bière de fruit: ça reste une gueuze au fruit plutôt quune bière de fruit (avec du sirop ou du jus) qui révèle doucement ses arrières-goûts de levures et de malt avec une effervescence moyenne. Donc, bel équilibre entre acidité, sucre et fruit.","Braine, BELGIUM","poech73"

4434,"2013-09-15",4.3,"375 mL bottle from Conn Ave Wine & Spirits in DC. Pours a murky orange gumwood color with minimal bubbly white head. Nose holds balanced plum and vinous fruit tones mixing with an earthy, lightly lemony funk. The palate is much more complex, with gorgeous plum, prune, unripe peach, tannic acidity, light citric tang and basement funk. Palate is captivating; definitely not nearly as aggressive as most fresh Cantillon fruit lambics, with a finish that is soft, almost caressing, though still acidic. The middle of the mouthfeel harkens a bit towards Drie Fonteinen, with touches of quenching dryness remaining secondary to that musty cobweb and wet basement quality so seldom found in fruit lambics, moreso in top-tier gueuzes. The fruit hits up front and at the end, which strikes me as a very excellent quality. Pierre Tilquin has created a fruit lambic so distinct from the traditionally dominant blenders/brewers, and it excels. Superb.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

Medium sized vast but lively and quicker than a cider disappearing creamy foamy head. Within seconds theres no foam, just a hazy yellow more like a hazy orange colored beer without a foamy head...
Aroma is uber Lambic: dust, peach, sweat, stone, cellar, shed, barnyard, sour, earth, hay, some horse blanket, horse saddle, wood, older flowers, grains, cheese, wild yeast, some sugars, just the slightest hint of something like plums.
Flavours of sour tones, lemon acidty, light dusty, barnyard, rope, hay, peach, cabbage, wild yeast, horse blanket, grapefruit, plums, apricot, dry wood and dry yeast tones, some cheese, some funky tones and older flowers. Quite a strong acidity
Aftertaste is a mix of sour, cheese, wild yeast, old grains and old hay, funky, a hint of peach and apricot, some grapefruit, a light lemon ish acidity and some wood.
Low to medium carbo, light watery funky dry and sour ish mouthfeel, medium to fuller bodied and a texture that is between watery and creamy.
This is a world class beer, incredible tasty and balanced and funky with a somewhat easy character, unless you let the beer breath for an hour or longer, than it gets so much more acidity and typical Lambic flavours that these beer shows it has two faces.

Carbonation is quite low, just slippery texture. Really juicy plums of the yellow-fleshed sort that go from sour rocks to rankly sweet mush in half a day unless you catch them at the right time. Theyre lovely and they dominate, with wheaty tartness supporting and cleaning up the palate. Some almonds and apricots.

4434,"2013-08-21",4.2,"A steady pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a fat-one-finger thick, pale tan colored head; despite the reduced thickness, the head is quite persistent, and leaves a relatively thick, layered lacing on the sides of the glass. The beer is a murky amber color that shows a light read stained, light-gold hue when held up to the light. The nose smells tart and quite fruity at first blush. Musty, woody, lightly spicy, and floral notes also play a role. Specific aromas of light urea, sweet floral notes leaning towards carnations, perhaps a touch of rose, definite floral plum, and even some peppery floral notes add to the blossoming expression found here. Dried wildflowers, dried hay, and a touch of grain like character are found in the long finish.

Quite a bit more sour tasting than the aroma might have suggested; this has a bracing acidity that is mostly lactic in character, but whose complexity seems to be boosted by a fruit derived acidity too. This is quite effervescent, and definitely light bodied, which suggest at a champagne like texture, but this does have more body than a champagne, with a touch of lactic slickness and some touches of residual grain body. The finish is quite dry, definitely acidic, a touch spicy, with a musty phenolic note, and with quite a bit of wood flavors. The floral and fruit character is a bit reduced from the aroma, but still contributes noticeable spicy floral notes, touches of something like carnations, and a general fruitiness that could lean towards floral plum like notes, and perhaps even some tart, astringent, dark berry like notes. The long finish almost has a strawberry note, perhaps it is guava, or papaya, but a definite interesting fruit edge to the flavor. As the beer warms up it gets quite a bit more fruity, and in complex, unexpected ways (tropical).

This is a pretty fantastic Fruit Lambic. The plums contribute more of a general, though quite noticeable, fruitiness rather than being as specific as say a Frambois, or a Kriek, but it still really works quite well; it makes this a bit more Gueuze like in some ways, which is certainly not a bad thing. There is lots of wood, lots of fruit, omnipresent sourness, and a solid funkiness, all of which make for a nicely balanced beer that I am quite enjoying; much better than I expected even, Tilquin is really doing things right.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

A - Pours a beautiful hazy pink grapefruit body that just screams pulpy fruit juice. A fingers worth of bone white foam fades into a thick edging that lasts quite a while. Swirling creates some gorgeous lacing but retention is low here. I was told the 750s carbed up a bit more than the 375s but this is looking pretty damn active to me.

S - Lemons, hay, funky cheese, and some stone fruit. The plums are very subtle here but they provide just enough fruitiness to make this stand out from the normal gueuze. Very brett heavy.

T - Super mouth puckering sour. Lemons, hay, plenty of funk, and some woody oak barrel. The plums are present in a light stone fruit juiciness but seem to be squashed out by the huge sourness. Its incredibly tasty, its just not as fruit forward as other fruit lambics tend to be. In fact its extremely gueuze like. Mouth feel is crisp and lively.

4434,"2013-07-12",4.1,"Pours an red-orangish brown color. Probably a bit too red for a wood stain, but it would be a bright cherry pine, kinda garish, really. No real head. Were in lambic country, so normal rules do not apply, not that Im much of a believe in appearance ratings. The aroma is plum jam on top of mild vinegar and gueuze funk, but the fruit is dominant. The plum smell is on the apricot end of the plum world. It definitely smells like plums, but theres a fair bit of variation within plums. This beer smells more like what is sold as fresh French prunes, around here, rather than the juicier, sweet-tart Santa Rosa plum that I more closely associate with the fruit, though I have no idea what Tilquin actually used, of course. The funk is mildly cheesy with some nice horse blanket tendencies bouncing around (its been too long since I used ""horse blanket"" in a review). The taste is light to medium tart with more of that fruit flavor. Its still relatively sweet and a tad lacking in flavor for what I expect from a plum sour, but I dont mean that as a knock. Its just a tad different than expected. The fruit flavor is refined and melds nicely with the tartness. Theres a big lemony note. The vinegar tartness is actually pretty restrained, and theres none of that back-of-the-throat burn that many American sours suffer from. Tilquin does a magnificent job balancing the flavors, showing off that quality lambic brewer touch. Carbonation is normal. Mouthfeel is a tad slick with fruitiness. Moderate pucker. I quite enjoyed this beer. Its not a dramatic beer, but it has a lovely fruit flavor and oozes lambic complexity and refinement.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Thanks to Bruce for sharing this beer which was one of the finest opened all night. A truly top notch lambic in all aspects I would have been able to drink it all night if not for a number of other distractions. I look forward to tracking down a few more Tilquin bottles in Belgium later this year.

Aroma / Appearance - The pour was the color of grapefruit juice with a icy white head. Sweaty gym socks, strawberries, and light chocolate are the main centerpieces of that traditionally dry bretty feel that comes from a true Belgian lambic.

Flavor / Palate - Almost immediately the vinegary sour texture attacks the palate. Like sips of paint thinner it scrapes away all the previous beers until all that remains is a fruity blend of vinegar. Intense from start to finish I can almost still taste it now. Based on this sample I might have to give Tilquin more attention when I get home.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Consumed at home B/H Mon 27th May 2013 This was the 2nd batch reading the description above, so from what I read plummier but less exclusive, I can live with the additional plumminess over the rarity. It pours muddy brown, I did like to think that there was a slight mauve colour to this but that is just wishful thinking, no head atop. Aroma is fruity, funky and if you can smell sour then that as well. Wonderfully tart and with a tanginess and fruitiness that you get from something like a good ol English fruit crumble that uses something like rhubarb or similar to really tart it up, but I am not suggesting this has a rhubarb flavour, it doesnt but the plums have that nice tart, tangy, challenging fruity bite, and I can get them in here. Lip smacker and a mouth awakener but with a slight thickness in the mouth and a late dryness, good stuff, in fact very good, Loz really liked it as well.

I had the last edition of the Quetsche last year (didnt write ratings down then, so cant really rate that though), but in my memory, last years edition = BATCH 1 was WAY BETTER. I also drank the beer when it was released just for some days, so it cant be that, really wonder where it went wrong? The beer than didnt really shout out the plum this much, it was more like a very very good geuze, but now it has the plum overruling the rest of the taste.
Appearance: reminded me of grapefruit juice, little to no foam.
Nose: grapefruit noticeable again, sugar, sweetness.
Taste: grapefruits again, little to no sourness, some red fruits, plums are very noticeable as well, and quite overruling... Someone I was sharing this bottle with, said that this reminded him a lot of plum pie more than a geuze...

4434,"2013-01-25",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 28, 2013 The other morning I was in a hurry to grab a bottle for brunch with my wife... went down into the cellar looking for a 2011-2012 Oude Gueuze Tilquin and mistakenly grab this instead.  Cracked it open with some raisin challah french toast and proceeded to enjoy it without realizing what I had done.  Two days later, I am back in my cellar looking for this to bring to a tasting--bam it hits me--that nice fruity beverage from brunch the other morning wasnt a great batch of Tilquins Oude Gueuze... it was the Oude Quetsche.  After some mild embarassment that my palate hadnt noticed my error earlier, I realized why this beer is so good.  It adds just a little bit of fruity plum to the Oude Gueuze and improves on the product.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"

4434,"2012-11-17",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2013 Zythos Bierfestival 2012, Leuven, Belgium. Big thanks to Sebletitje for this. Sebastian ROCKS IT as usual. It pours opaque looking copper with loose tan head. The aroma offers up faint musty prunes and modest sour and tart notes moving toward some woody notes. The taste begins tart and moves into sour notes nuanced by vinegar and fruit skin like tannins. It then heads into a dry finish thinly ringed around the edges by a light sense of some sort of vague fruitiness. Could use a bit more prune influence in the taste. Good stuff nonetheless. Cant wait to try one with a bit more cellar time. Lovely brew. Im really enjoying this brewery.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Sparkling and tart, floral and juicy, with the suggestion of red-grapeskin tannin. Finishes dry. That perfumed impression of fine plum schnapps is pleasant and stands throughout.

4434,"2012-11-07",4.2,"Small, but relatively stable yellowish-beige head over fully cloudy orange-ochre beer. Farmyard odour, hard leatherfat, citrus (lemon especially); only very faintly fruity, all the more gueuze-y. Sharp lemony flavour; flowery, fruitzeste, again - if restrained - leatherfataroma as a flavour. Finish is rather abrupt, just the lemony sourness tangentially fleeting. Sharpish, very tart, dry-out effect to quite some extent. Maybe medium bodied still. Phenomenally refreshing. Just as experienced with other (non-lambic) quetche beers, theres not a very distinct, recognisable fruitflavour. What remains is a superb lambicbeer... bettering all the time @ Tilquin.

4434,"2012-10-14",4.2,"Bottle at Moeder Lambic Fontainas, Brussels. It pours hazy golden amber, with a medium white head. The nose is farmyard, subtle spice, dough, light vinegar, lemon, lime and sweet over-ripe fruit. The taste is Granny Smith apple, tart pithy lemon, plum skin, moderate acidity, mouth-puckering tartness, red grape skin and floral aspect, with a tart finish. The fairly high initial tartness smooths out to a more fruity finish. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Plums are not in your face....so to speak!

Not that much prune/fruit taste actually, with a nice dry aftertaste. A nice first fruit geuze from Pierre! Second batch is much better then the first one imo, much more plum taste, great but crazy expensive!","BELGIUM","tquest"
4434,"2012-09-01",4.2,"Rating based on what I see as some of the many evolutionary-stages of this beer.  My rating is based on the final version and inputs about its evolution over the last 6 months. First sample was kindly offered at ZBF by Pierre and offered a nice introspect into the early stage of the Questche. My second version was sampled during the Tilquin open doors in May 2012 with a nice panel of brewers weighing in on the matter, and the third, and final stage, was sampled on September 1st 2012 from a bottle kindly shared by Tderoeck at Tilquin.
Couleur est un subtile mélange alternant un orangé-ambre et un acajou fruité qui selon moi était plus présent dans les versions antérieures. Le col est épais présentant une belle résistance dans des tons beiges.
Arôme et cest là que mon opinion va changer, présente ce changement de par un profile fruité sucré qui satténue pas mal en lespace de qcq mois, autant en mars la prune se faisait bien plus présente, ici elle est toujours notable mais avec un clair bouquet de gueuze qui laisse une balance entre les lambics, levure et la prune. 
Palais est agréablement fruité avec pour moi un profile fruité qui vient plus titiller la fin de bouche et ce profile somptueux de prune tout en alternant un côté sec/poussiéreux moyennement aigre-acidulé de la gueuze avec ce côté houblon à cru. En mars, je notais un côté fruité noir nettement plus en avant, qui ici rétrocède un peu tout en restant agréable. Palais reste bien pétillant venant touché le haut du palais sur un côté moyennement épicé/fruité.

Jarrête ici car je nai pas vraiment pour habitude décrire autant sur une bière. 

Au final, une bière qui me plaît, énormément de par sa complexité mais aussi de par son goût évolutif qui en qcq mois montre déjà de subtiles signes de changement. Pour ma part, mon avis reste mitigé mais positif, tout comme la Zwanze 2011 que javais pu goûter avec qcq mois en bouteille, je trouvais une petite préférence à ce profile fruité sucré qui était plus en avant au palais mais qui ici aussi reste présent après qcq mois. Une bière à mettre en cave et à revisiter dans les années à venir.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

4434,"2012-09-01",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2013 Had this one two times allready. First time was a small sample from Erwins glass at the brewery. Second time we opened a bottle at t Schooltje with Carlo and Urbain Nose is rather mediocre, slightly citrus, some exotic fruits. Taste is nice sourness, prunes are not very prominent. In fact its more a really good geuze, with a little bit more fruitiness to it. Good job. Looking forward to upcoming batches of this.

Update: I really dont get why the first and second batch are under the same rating. Those are two totally different beers. First one was a real complex geuze with a nice hint of the plums. Now its just liquid plum pie... I dont get it...","Brussels, BELGIUM","Mathieu87"
