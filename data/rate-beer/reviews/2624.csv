2624,"2012-02-22",3.0,"From notes.  First reviewed 6/30/2009.  Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a Weizen glass.

The Kristall Weizen pours a delicate golden color, more robust in the thicker parts of the glass. A thick fluffy white head forms immediately, fading to leave a 2 cm head remaining. Noticeable perpetual carbonation rises from the bottom of the glass to keep the head fresh.

Light lemon notes, but the main aroma is floral. Not a strong smell overall, but it seems to drift casually up from the beer. 

A mostly floral wheat taste from start to finish. Hints of lemon zest and bananas poke their way through as well. There is not much of a hop presence, not that I would expect much in a weizen like this. 

Definitely a smooth feel; the carbonation and wheat flavor give it a light, pleasant feel on the tongue. 

The light floral flavors do not really move me, but that is probably a comment on the style more than this one in particular.  Not one that I am really going to go out of my way to buy.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Some distinctive wheat ale aromas/flavors--doughy, bready, with banana, clove, and citrus yeast phenols--but not much, the overall effect is quite neutral. Banana and bubble gum aromas increase as it warms. Kristallweizen is the filtered style of German wheat ale (as opposed to hefeweizen, which retains the yeast in suspension.) In general, the public prefers the brilliance and clarity of light golden beers, but I personally prefer the cloudy appearance and improved taste, body, mouthfeel and bottle finishing characteristics of yeast.

The body is light but does retain some creaminess from the wheat. Carbonation is fairly high.

The aroma is banana cream pie with the vanilla pudding, and bananas, and crust, and all.

The taste is pale malt and sweet wheat, vanilla or oak, apple and banana esters, and a touch of yeast.","Sanford, Florida, USA","SanfordBrewer"
2624,"2011-07-26",3.3,"16.9 ounce bottle - $2.79 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours clear, golden in appearance, with a tall, foamy, whitish head.

Smell: Sweetish nose, smelling of malted wheat, natch, with a faroff hint of lemon drop candy.

Taste: Middling maltiness, lightly wheaty, with very, very, very small touches of light-colored caramel and honey. Moderately sweet. Near nil lemon included, but, sorry, not really picking up any spice, banana, hop character, and bitterness. Just a fairly clean beer throughout. Sweetish taste of honey wheat loaf on the finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. Medium (just barely) carbonation.

Overall: About average for a kristalweizen, and, when tried side-by-side with Tuchers underpowered hefe, I preferred actually this.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

The head is tall and white in color, with large air pockets visible along the edge of the glass.  Initially, the nose is quite sour, but that seems to fade away, even after letting my nose readjust.  After things settle down, the beer smells somewhat sweet and oddly grainy like a cream ale, with the expected wheat aroma behind the cream ale scent.  Strange, but okay I guess.  The flavor is pretty light in general, again being on the sweet side, with mild spice, yeast and wheat flavors, and minimally bitter.  But in the finish, theres that sweet flavor thats reminiscent of a cream ale.

Contrasted to Tucher's Dunkles Hefe-Weizen, this stuff is weak, diluted swill - but that is too harsh. The Dunkles Hefe-Weizen is a truly great beer, and this one is merely slightly above average.
