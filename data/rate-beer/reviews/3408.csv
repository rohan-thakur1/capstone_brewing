3408,"2015-12-12",3.8,"750ml bottle acquired via trade on BA. Thanks, bro. Been hanging on to a few ratings from here for awhile. Better do the thing. Pours a fairly well hazed copper amber hue. A darker middle, a bit murky with some gentle orange copper glow onto the edges that strikes the right light at times. Frothy offwhite head atop is creamy, full, a good retention as a firmer filmy layer. Pleasant spidery lacing. Aromas are potent and punchy, firmer lactic appeal and tannic wine barrel meets some nice bigger raspberry skin, some seedy fruit, firmer lactic citric sourness, punchy and dry, yogurt and oak. As it settles, the raspberry offers a bit more potency, seedy and macerated, a bit tannic and a good sourness cutting through a bit of carmelized and gently sweet deadened malts. Initial is lighter bodied overall, a potent citric sourness is lemon, orange and grapefruit, some potent lactic acidity. Yogurt, some gentle acidic jabs and more citrusy juice and a bit of rind. Gentle raspberry elements start to grow, some firmer oak, vanilla and some yogurt. Gentle faint spiciness, earth, a bit of spritzy appeal. The raspberries, seedy and a nice sour/sweet appeal is pleasant onto the backend and finish. Grapefruit, subtle cherry and some good cranberry to meet that raspberry lemonade like appeal. This never gets acedic, ending up fairly light and crushable overall. Raspberry lemonade, yogurty and a bit tannic and oaky onto the backend. A tart sour appeal with pleasant lighter body, twangy sourness and gentle sweetness that never interferes. Lighter, pleasant stuff. The nose leaves a touch to be desired in potency but overall when compared to its lighter appeal/drinkability, it totally makes sense. Nice stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
