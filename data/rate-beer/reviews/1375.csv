1375,"2014-02-13",3.7,"Ratign #969 - February 11, 2014 - Ok, #tuesdaynightbeers. $4.99 CAD for a 650ml Bomber from Coop.Little bit of tan bubbly foam on a niggardly black brew (is that word acceptable? No? Good.) Lots of cool toasted malt chocolate coffee aromas. Palate is light crisp and full of flavour, but very light-medium bodied. This is sessionable and a killer bad boy brew. Cerveza me up another.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","bulldogops"
1375,"2014-02-03",3.6,"Pours deep brown-copper with little head with some lacing in the glass. Malt is present with a touch of a bite from hops. Chocolate and caramel are lurking. Nice mouth feel. Interesting and tasty.","CANADA","houblonchien"
1375,"2014-01-29",3.8,"Bottle. Root beer pour, little bit of white head. Aroma - big and malty, spices, roasted malts, light grains. Taste - slight sweetness, big malt backbone, spices, toasty,really well balanced with lots of flavour. Goes down well after a burrito, which based on the label is exactly what they were going for.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","kbudd19"
1375,"2014-01-24",3.8,"Looks darker than a beer that would be lighter. It does have a thick brown cap and decent lacing. Dry roasted malts, toasted grains, earth, milk chocolate, old cinnamon - all put together wonderfully. Very tasty as well. Dusty mellow choco, biscuit, possibly cinnamon, mellow roasted malts. Very balanced. Soft and very slightly oily mouthfeel, roasty finish with a hint of hop on the finish. Very enjoyable unlike this oilers game or falling down the stairs and breaking your colostomy bag on a first date.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"
1375,"2014-01-19",2.2,"Very off smelling lager yeast that masks any malt or hop smell. Taste is slight chocolate, watery but a little sweet. No hop presence, nothing too notable or redeeming","Alberta, CANADA","NatKadaw"
1375,"2014-01-15",3.8,"Pours a clear dark brown with a small beige ring of head that fades to pretty much nothing. Aroma is rich malty sweetness, bread crusts, nutty, hints of chocolate and toffee. Flavour is rich sweet darker malt(Munich like), bread crust like melanoidins, roasted malt, toffee, nutty, chocolate, and overall a clean lager profile without any real fruity esters. Really tasty beer.","Alberta, CANADA","andrewturba"
1375,"2013-12-29",3.6,"Bottle - Toasted malts, light chocolate and bread. Clear amber with a rich brown head. Tastes just like it smells. Roasty and rich, a nice Dunkel.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"

1375,"2013-12-26",3.4,"650ml bottle pours a deep amber color with a finger and a half of off-white head that leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is chocolate with some grassy notes. Taste is a chocolate malty sweetness with a grassy hop bitterness with some notes of cinnamon and another spice I cant seem to grasp. Overall, this is quite a tasty brew and suits the style well. Definitely, recommended to try.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"
1375,"2013-12-24",3.3,"Bottle. Medium to dark brown with amber highlights, average off white head. Grainy aroma, some chocolate and hay. The spice shows up in the palate nicely, gentle cinnamon and chocolate, but grainy and light overall. Pleasant.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
1375,"2013-12-18",3.6,"A nice refreshinging yet dark and well roasted brew. Pours a nearly opaque black with a thin beige head. The nose has mild lime and lemon citrus hop notes as well as hints of brown candy sugars, light dark fruits and mild toffee malts. A bit sweet and molasses like in the middle with a moderate bitterness on the finish. Nice balance overall with a good easy to sip feel.","Alberta, CANADA","patricks110"
1375,"2013-11-11",3.4,"Bottled sample. Dark brown in colour with light fizzy carbonation. Aromas are of fruity toffee, milk chocolate, and whole wheat toast. More chocolate upfront on the palate, along with ash, and mild toasted malts. Light bodied, but in a way that enhances its drinkability. Not a favorite style for me, but I could see this working as a darker alternative on a hot patio.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
1375,"2013-05-29",3.4,"Bomber from tbadiuk. Murky brown with a biege head. Fruity with apply being the most prominent, grass, bit of caramel and grains. Moderate carbonation and body, becomes dry, get some chocolate and roasted malts on the finish.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"

1375,"2012-09-27",2.9,"UPDATED: SEP 28, 2012 On tap at the Alibi Room, pours a cloudy very dark amber brown with a medium beige head. Aroma is quite nutty, with some toasted nuts, mild dark fruits, and some wheat. Flavour is quite sour, something undetectable on the nose, with sour fruits, toasted nuts, some dried dark fruits and some bready notes. I wonder if this is how its supposed to be with the sourness. Seems off the mark to me, but its drinkable in small doses.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1375,"2012-09-14",3.8,"Pours black thin head. Roasted malt and vanilla in the aroma.  Flavor is very nice chocolate and caramel nice brew a little dark for dunkle. But, very tasty none the less.",", Alberta, CANADA","Cole"
1375,"2012-09-14",3.7,"Bottle - Thanks Dave! I certainly didnt expect such a generous box in the mail! Pours clear deep walnut brown/mahogany into my Minneapolis Town Hall glass. Thin off-white head, spotty to poor lacing. Nose is gentle malt, some cinnamon, dark fruit, some spice here too. Flavours of dark fruit, leather, spice, lots of malty berries. Soft and inoffensive, but not really my favourite Half Pints.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","Savvy1982"
1375,"2012-09-10",4.1,"Dark reddish, thin white head. Loses carbonation quickly. Caramel, some smoke. A little brown ale type nuttiness. Chocolate in the finish. Palate is light and smooth. Gets better as it warms. So good. 091012","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","slimspady"
1375,"2012-09-06",2.4,"Pint at St. Augustines. Cloudy brown with khaki cap. Tart, roasted malt aroma. Definite unripe fruit (apricot?) in smell and taste. Taste is roasty too. Palate is plain. Thisll make me fart good tho.","British Columbia, CANADA","XaenDovet"
1375,"2012-09-01",3.9,"What a good beer. Pours a chestnut brown with off white head. Smells like sweet malts and raisin bread dough. Very nice. Lots going on with the flavour profile. Raisins, sweet malts, espresso, dark chocolate. I also taste a touch of fruitiness too. Apples or pineapple. Nice smooth palate with some bubbles. Lingering dark chocolate/coffee finish. Awesome stuff half pints!","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","cards04"

1375,"2012-08-25",3.5,"Dark brown/amber colour, somewhat transparent with brown head, well carbonated, nice lacing. Aroma of sweet malts, dark chocolate, grapes, prunes. Taste is sweet fruit with an aftertaste of bitter dark chocolate. Im not a huge fan of dunkels but this one is mighty fine.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","northropfrye"
1375,"2012-08-21",3.7,"65 cl bottle, Winnipeg, MB, Canada. Dense brown, root beer appearance. Sweet raisin and chocolate aroma with some underlying hazelnuts. Sweet flavour, more raisin, then a building cocoa taste that is then overwhelmed by more prune and raisin. Quite complex and not artificial chocolate overload like others.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","markas101"
