3293,"2015-07-02",4.0,"Drinking from the bottle via Krug, because thats what I have, although Ive enjoyed it several times unfiltered at the Keller. Its more fun that way but it retains plenty of character in the bottle. The aroma speaks of nutty, grainy, honeyish malt, while the taste shares that with a firm, spicy hop-bitterness. More carbonation from the bottle too, easily remedied with an angry pour. One of those really simple but flavorful beers that make you wonder why we put up with the other sorts of simple beers.","Berlin, GERMANY","JoeinDahlem"

3293,"2014-10-17",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Quaint herbal and grassy hops wade in this Kellerbiers soft cereals, creating a most süffig pint.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the apparently blond brew.
-Bitterness is rather light.
-Hops could be better defined for this to be a top brew in the area (in my tastes).
-This is balanced and as easy drinking as can be.
-This and the Lieberth brew close by obviously share the same water source. Super soft stuff.

3293,"2013-05-19",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 23, 2013 Draft at the Keller (on two occasions).

Head is mostly diminishing.
Body is medium to dark yellow.

Aroma is moderately malty (toasted grain/bread, cookie), moderately hoppy (herbs, flowers), with notes of honey, lime zest, pineapple, spearmint.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately to heavily bitter.

Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation.

Remarkably tasty, and very pilsner-ish...quite herbal/spicy-hoppy with very assertive (but very clean) bitterness.  Impossible to stop drinking due to the superb balance and wonderfully fruity-honeyish aroma.  I think I actually prefer this to the Witzgall, but both are excellent.  Also tried from bottle (purchased at the keller), and while a little less explosive in the nose, its still excellent...which is a relief considering how much inconsistency Ive been finding from sample to sample in many other brewers.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3293,"2013-04-24",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 11, 2013 Draught at Brauerei Roppelt, Nov. 2012: Light hazy golden. Jagged, uneven fringe of small bubbles surrounds a broken center. Pleasant nose of dusty yeast, flowers, and subtle melanoidins. Hint of soured fruit, alcohol, minerals, and baguette. Slightly seltzery carbonation, but fairly creamy and soft. Lemony hops commence alongside a sweeter and fluffier vanilla-cake maltiness. Lovely rustic yeast signature imparts a bit of residue on the tongue. Succulent hop character subtly exudes, yet the much of the brightness gets overshadowed by the yeast and alcohol. Body teeters toward flabby, as well, and at times things become somewhat muddled. But the delightfully juicy body is met with an equally enticing melanoidin character. Considerably sturdy malt brings to mind heller bock in all its weighty beefiness, as it possesses a refined glazed-sugar sweetness, yet never becomes overbearingly sweet. Elegant nectar-driven hoppiness (Hallertauer?) fuses with lemon-verbena (Tettnanger?) to lend a delectable lemon-candy effect. Finishes cleanly malty, with buoyant notes of cake delicately kissed with pastry cream and some minerals to counterbalance. A very respectable kellerbier that I really wanted to love, but it  stops just shy of being sensational for me as its just a tad muddled and alcoholic. Also has that soured fruitiness sometimes found in Franken lager.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3293,"2013-02-02",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 4, 2015 draft at Brauerei Roppelt in Stiebarlimbach, as Roppelt Lagerbier.  hazed pale gold body with a creamy and fine white head. cheesy and musty and spicy German hop nose reminds me of Ganstallar Zwicklpils, though much less yeasty. astoundingly soft velvet texture with fine creamy carbonation. musty, grassy, cheesy, lightly spicy hops character with a full dose of fruit nectar and jelly. very hop-focused experience, which is somewhat un-Bavarian.  lemon and lime oils, perfume / potpourri, grasses / herbs all dance with energy.  snappy crisp to the back-end of an otherwise perfectly soft malt body. juicy, bitter, fresh and endlessly drinkable.
Again in November 2013, it was limp, watery, fruity, apple-y / green.  Probably 3.2 level stuff.  Ill keep the 4.4 high water mark but say it varies like a lot of Franconian beer, more than you would think initially.March 2015: okay, a little odd / metallic, not as hoppy or grassy, malt kind of flabby. 3.4-3.6 level stuff.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
