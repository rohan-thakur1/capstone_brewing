996,"2017-05-06",3.7,"Pours opaque nut-brown with a 1-finger tan head. Aroma is mild, with notes from both the orange and cocoa showing. Body is medium-to-full with a touch of oil to it. The finish is lightly astringent. Flavor of orange over a nutty malt base. The cocoa shows at the back as it warms, with the orange becoming stringer too.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","BillWyce"
996,"2017-04-15",4.5,"While mandarin orange and cocoa sound like odd bedfellows for a Belgian Ale, theres often noticeable bittersweet chocolate character in dark-colored Belgian beers, and orange peel often appears as a subtle ingredient in Belgian brewing. Sierra Nevada just found a way to highlight these elements in a brew that still feels distinctly Belgian. You definitely pick up on the cocoa and orange peel - they reveal a careful balance of bitter and sweet - but theyre not overwhelming. This brown brew has many of the technical trappings of an abbey ale. Velvety smooth feel, malty flavors, and a complexity that doesnt interfere with the cohesion.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Pours deep brown almost black with a lathery lite tan head very nice head retention with some nice lacing. Nose has notes of chocolate, oranges, lots of coca, nice sweetness yet well balanced with the lightly toasted malts. Flavors exhibit the malt profile very nicely with a very good dose of coca. This beer is definitely well made and has lots of character between the dark malts and coca. Big, rich coca./chocolate, lite nutty notes, rich and complex. Long finish of lingering coca and nuts. A really damn good brew from SN here-could be my favorite of the Ovila series.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"

996,"2017-01-23",3.1,"Part of the Sierra Nevada Ovila 750ml Mix Pack - $23.99 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours a very dark brown body with a goodly-sized, beige head. Light lacing.

Smell: Fire-licked breadcrusts and rough-chopped pecans for an earthy, charred toast nose, with bitterish-scented cocoa powder and a far-off hint of oily citrus.

Taste: Roasty and burnt, ash and smokey char, though given some chocolate to sooth it a smidge. Dark fruitiness, also a little bit of orange, like a spoonful of triple sec. Middling bitterness. Pinch of black pepper spiciness. Roasty, revived cocoa powder and more of those seared nuts. Never ever really feels particularly like a Belgian ale, dubbel or otherwise.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-plus carbonation.

Overall: I didnt find the surprising degree of bitterish, hard chary taste to be appealing. The mandarin character came up short, but also the yeast was far from characterful.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

The cocoa and mandarin, were used with a relatively light hand, and add subtle aromas and flavors without dominating the underlying beer overly much. A bit more sweetness from caramel/crystal malts would be pleasant. This is more of a Brown Ale variant than a Belgian Strong.
