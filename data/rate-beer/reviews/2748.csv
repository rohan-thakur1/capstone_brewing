Appearance: Clear golden with a small white head and some lacing. 

Aroma: Quite floral with whisky features upfront, peaches, malts, moderate spiciness and woodsy notes. 

Taste: Moderately sweet with strong barrel features again, chewy malts, floral/herbal features, peaches and moderate spiciness. 

Palate: Medium body. Medium carbonation. Dry and woodsy finish. Malts and whisky aftertaste. 

Overall: Obviously this isnt super easily drinkable nor balanced, but its still a fairly interesting beer nonetheless. The barrel features hides the base beer, but since the base beer doesnt seems that worthy its not a huge loss and it showcase the whisky in an interesting way (different that in some massive and super flavorful RIS).","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

2748,"2014-12-21",3.1,"Backlog rating. 33cl bottle from Utobeer, London. It pours a clean golden color with a small white head. Aroma is sweet and grainy, with notes of corn, bubble gum, dried apricots and dried lemon leaves. Taste is medium sweet, lightly bitter, with a closing of grains and light boozy bitterness.

2748,"2014-11-27",3.6,"330ml Bottle bought in Edinburgh:
As it turned out this one wasnt too bad an offering from Harviestoun but I was expecting a lot more from it, it just seemed too light and ordinary when the bottle is presented as being something completely different. It went down easy enough but there wasnt much to it that would have me crying out for another bottle Im afraid.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

On the nose aromas of vanilla fudge, dried grass, lightly toasted white bread and some dried fruits with some clear sherry action. The texture; at first light lively is developping quickly into voluptuously slickness in which flavours of bready/toasty malts and dried dark fruits harmonically intermingle.

2748,"2014-05-20",3.3,"Butelka 0.33L.
Wygląd: Złote, klarowne z obfitą, białą pianą, drobnopęcherzykową. Lacing dość dobry, piana opada w umiarkowanym tempie. 
Aromat: przede wszystkim słodowy, zbożowy, typowy dla jasnego lagera, bez zbytnich aromatów utlenienia. W tle lekko owocowy aromat. Być może bierze się on od leżakowania w beczce, poza tym whisky czy beczka niewyczuwalne.
Smak: słodowym o czystym profilu, nie głęboko odfermentowany jasny lager. Goryczka niska, krótka lekko ziołowa z delikatnie wyczuwalnym alkoholem. Finisz półwytrawny.
Odczucia. wysycenie niskie-średnie, ciało średnie, faktura pudrowa.
Całość: W zasadzie to zwykły, całkiem dobrze zrobiony jaksny lager. Tylko za taką cenę !? Zupełnie nie ma sensu. Beczek whisky praktycznie nie wyczuć, zdecydowanie lepiej byłoby zakupić w tej samej cenie, któreś piwko z serii Ola Dubh z tego samego browaru.

Pod koniec piwa armaty whisky zaczęły się pojawiać. Może nie olśniewają ale przestaje być już tak nudno więc daję +1 do aromatu. Słodki, kwiatowy, miodowy - typowy speysider. 
Z ciekawości do końcówki piwa dolałem trochę single malta z tego samego regionu. W aromacie whisky zdominowało piwa, za to w smaku zrobił się fajny balans pomiędzy trunkami i długi finisz, którego nie było w piwie wcale.","Gdynia, POLAND","radzik5555"
2748,"2014-05-11",3.3,"Barwa: złota, idealnie klarowna. Piana biała, niezbyt obfita, drobno pęcherzykowa, szybko opadająca i utrzymująca się jedynie przy ściankach. Wysycenie niskie. 

Aromat: słodowy, zbożowy i herbatnikowy. Lekkie nuty ziołowe, kwiatowe oraz szczątkowy aromat wanilii świadczący o leżakowaniu w beczce. Z czasem ten aromat przybiera na sile i staje się nieco alkoholowy. 

Smak: umiarkowanie pełny, słodowy oraz raczej słodki. Zbliżony do mocniejszych lagerów, bez wydatnej goryczki, z lekko alkoholową końcówką, w stylu whisky. 

Golden Nectar niestety rozczarowuje. Zapowiadanych nut beczkowych zbyt wiele nie ma. Występują w aromacie, jednak nie są tak silne i tak przyjemne, jak w piwach ciemnych serii Ola Dubh. Do tego pojawiają się dopiero po dłuższej chwili. W smaku natomiast te akcenty praktycznie nie występują. Reasumując nieco ciekawszy lager, ale z pewnością nie wart swojej ceny. Browar powinien się skupić zdecydowanie na piwach ciemnych.","Z±bki, POLAND","tomekk1978"

On the nose, sweet, bready and toffee caramel. Kind of like a sauce-free, dry portion of sticky toffee pudding. Tastewise, the sweetness is always soft, not cloying as with other whisky-aged lagers. Theres a clear aftertaste of Glenfarclas, when drunk at room temperature - I was expecting a lot less whisky pickup. Why, Im not so sure - this is Harviestoun, after all. I was initially skeptical about ageing Schiehallion, but its really nice - assuming you like Glenfarclas, of course [30032014]","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","BeerCast_Rich"
