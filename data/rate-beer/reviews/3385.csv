3385,"2017-05-22",4.1,"Can from Redmonds. Aroma is slightly sweet, orange/blood orange. Medium fizz which does quickly, and it behaves like a small batch, properly made beer. Which is refreshing. In a metaphorical sense. While the beer is also refreshing. In a literal sense. Chewy piney hops but not overly so, nice tropical notes as well. Very much in the British brewers take on an American Pale Ale style. The baseline of which is Gamma Ray. It tastes like Gamma Ray. Maybe a tad sweeter. Definitely less bitter and less fizzy. Really good. In fact.
