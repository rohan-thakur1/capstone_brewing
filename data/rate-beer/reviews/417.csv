417,"2013-07-21",3.8,"Appearance:
Slightly hazy hue of burnt caramel with glints of cherry wood along the sides. A khaki head lingers thick and bubbly. No lace.

Nose:
Cooked caramel and caramel nougat. Caramel cream in the back. Sticky. Freshly dipped caramel apples still soft to the touch. Honey kissed and caramel dipped cereal grains.

Palate:
Medium weight with a creamy lightly sticky mouthfeel. Caramel dominates in the middle while bitter apple and pear skins cleanse at the back of each quaff to bring me back for more. Caramel bran muffins. Vanilla in my breath. Toasted chestnuts dipped in caramel.

Final Thoughts:
I have a soft spot for cream ales and the Caramel Cream Ale from Due South hit the spot. Since my initial tasting, I have had the pleasure of quaffing quite a few more glasses of this delicious brew and it never grows old. Excellent balance of bitterness, sweetness, and sessionability.

417,"2012-12-10",3.5,"From the growler at Cajun Cafe Fall Fest 2012.  Pours a copper-caramel color with a white head.  Nose is big caramel with some mild sweetness and light grassy bitterness.  Flavor is like a caramel creme with the sweetness being the dominant flavor.  Light in body and pretty sessionable; enjoyable beer.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"

417,"2012-05-14",3.4,"On draft at Due South for their Grand Opening. Had heard about this beer from prior events so I was jazzed to try this one. Slight caramel cream notes with a tad bit of funk. Heard this batch may have been sub par so Ill give Due South a break here. Will definitely try again though.",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"
417,"2012-05-13",3.2,"Due South Brewery just opened yesterday.  May 12, 2013. Initial flavor was good,  good combination of malt and hops. After a few seconds my palate was hit with some very sweet notes. I didnt care for the sweet flavor combined with the bitterness of a hopped ale. Perhaps I just need to get used to the abundance of flavors.","Coconut Creek, Florida, USA","4265homebrew"
417,"2012-03-12",4.2,"Had at Jupiter Craft Brewers Festival 2012.  Once Due South gets into production this one is going to be selling like crazy.  Think of those caramel cream candies.  This beer smells AND tastes just like that.  Match those with a well bodied beer that has a good creamy mouthfeel that many in this style just dont have and you got a great tasting, easy drinking brew.","Boynton Beach, USA","MikeMoriendi"
417,"2011-11-16",3.5,"UPDATED: NOV 23, 2014 Re-rate: Can... More body, more vanilla and caramel flavor, less watery, but still an easy-drinker. Im digging this. Im a fan of the style. Cream ales got me through college at WVU.
Original rating:
Draft Treasure Coast Beer Fest 2011  Hazy amber ale with a mid-sized, creamy, off-white head. Fantastic retention. Im not pulling an awful lot from the nose; maybe some caramel  inoffensive, at the very least. Light-bodied and thin with modest carbonation. The flavor offers caramel, sugar cookie and vanilla. Finishes crisp and bittersweet. The flavor is very reminiscent of Anderson Valleys Cerveza Crema. Nice.Original score = 3.2","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
