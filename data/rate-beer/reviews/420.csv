420,"2016-07-11",3.7,"Bottle. A 9.1% cream ale? This must be of Biblical proportions! Bright golden orange with an almost white head. Fruit and vanilla in the aroma. The flavor is definitely intense for a cream. Big yeast and fruit beginning with vanilla behind that. Softer chocolate. There is stone fruit and very moderate bitterness. The cocoa grows with warming but this is generally well balanced with the fruit, cocoa, vanilla, and sweeter malts. I like it more than I expected to. It is certainly unique.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"

420,"2016-06-05",4.0,"Poured from the bomber, foggy dark orange. I dont know much about Moses for Im not a big reader of the bible, but on the other hand I did grow up on the Misfits. I could see myself drinking a couple two three of these bombers before going into maybe a cabaret metro, or other punk rock venue. It is a strong, malty, creamy, which would go down nice and fast without being offensive, which is essential when downing them fast in an alley, before a punk show.","Illinois, USA","TattooJack"

A very strange beer, but it kind of grows on you. The vanilla and cacao nibs are dominant, making for a completely different experience than a normal cream ale. If you go into this expecting just a high-gravity rendition of a cream ale, your win for a bit of a shock. As a whole, though, this beast kind of works. (13/20)","CANADA","UXO"

420,"2016-03-31",2.9,"Enjoyed this one at Dougs house on March 30 as part of an IPA tasting that spiraled out. 22 oz bottle. The pour on this is a bright foggy golden color with a thicker cap of white head that recedes slowly. The aroma is bitter. There is a lager type of metallic thing happening with it, without a whole lot of the vanilla and cocoa. There definitely isnt any creaminess here, because this baby comes off harsh for sure. The flavor is bitter and heavy. There is a light vanilla, and you can find the cocoa is you search for it, but its just a mess. Its bitter and dominating. The mouth feel is really off as well. Its really thin and light, with a bubbly, almost effervescent carbonation to go with a lingeringly bitter metallic finish. I think there is something wrong with this one, or Clown Shoes missed the mark, really bad.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

420,"2016-02-10",3.9,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/10/2015. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of cracker, corn, bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, cream, light vanilla/cocoa, light pear/apricot, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt and earthy hops; with light vanilla/cocoa and fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, bread, vanilla, cocoa, cream, herbal, grass, light pepper, light pear/apricot, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Light herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of cracker, corn, bread, vanilla, cocoa, cream, herbal, grass, light pepper, light pear/apricot, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, vanilla/cocoa, and light fruity yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with very smooth, fairly creamy/grainy, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is a very nice spiced imperial cream ale style. All around good robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, vanilla/cocoa, and light fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink for the big ABV. This followed the classic style characteristics very well, despite being an imperial version. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

420,"2016-01-29",2.1,"Sampled from a bomber bottle, 
this beer had a light to less than medium orange pour and gave a one to two finger white cover with some off-white bubbles, it left some spots and small fingers of lacing on the glass, 

the aromas were malt sweetness with light fruit that resembled orange, very light toasted malt in the background, a little vanilla, light citrus hops, 
the was a hint of cheap lager on the nose, 

it had flavors of malt sweetness, a little vanilla, and some alcohol flavor, not much else, 
the finish had a alcohol bitterness bite maybe with a little hop bitterness? Lots of sickly sweetness followed

the mouth feel was medium or a bit thicker, it was sticky on the lips, it had average carbonation maybe a little less, 

the nose was mostly sweet with little other hints, and the nose was not refined, the flavor had more sweetness than the nose, the flavor had a alcohol sweetness, the more I drank, the more I wish I had bought something else, I hard time drinking this beer, I would never buy this beer again or waste my time with this drink, there are better beers to enjoy, Clown Shoes makes some good beers, but this is not one of them.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

420,"2016-01-17",3.7,"On tap at Dutchs. Mostly clear, mildly hazy golden orange color. Thin white head. Leaves good ropes and ridges of lace. First impression is that it drinks much lighter than I expected, pretty easy sipping for the ABV. Alcohol is very minimal, much less of a bite than I expected. Could pass for 7%. Flavor is chocolate, vanilla, breadiness. Kind of cake-like, but not as rich. Moderate bitter taste, lighter to moderate sweet, more dry finish. Mild warmth on the back end that pushes the vanilla and cocoa long into the aftertaste. Medium-plus body. Smooth, crisp, lighter carbonation. Mild slick texture.
