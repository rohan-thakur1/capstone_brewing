3702,"2017-04-09",3.6,"Keg - Dove & Olive, Surry Hills, Sydney. Poured a ruddy chestnut brown with a small but lasting and lacing beige to light tan head. Nutty, earthy, bready malts and yeast combine with mid-fruits, citrus, some resin and juicy tropical fruits. Mid-weight, medium carbonation and a moderate length and intensity bitterness to finish","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","sm89walt"
3702,"2017-03-17",3.2,"On tap at Royal Albert Hotel in Surry Hills, Sydney. Pours a earthy reddish colour, with a white head. Aroma: Earthy, vegetable aromas. Taste: Surprisingly enough it tastes likes its name. Metallic flavours coupled with strong earthy and malty overtones. An interesting and unusual beer, but disappointing. Definitely worth a try though!","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","macca147"

3702,"2016-01-10",3.6,"Can. Pours amber with nice beige head. Aroma has quite some tropical hop notes and then nice toasty malts. Taste is very juicy for its style, hops, citrusy, light grapes and malty sweetness. Avg. carbonation and nice dry and toasty finish melts together with the hoppy bitterness.","Aarhus, DENMARK","Lukasmh"

3702,"2015-12-15",3.1,"Deep red with a tan head. Citrus hop aroma with sweet bready and toffee notes. This tastes nowhere near as sweet as the nose suggests. Muted toffee and molasses with a slight hoppy bitterness. Light and dry texture. ItÂ’s ok.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","whoisghost"
