>>> A superior Irish Ale with a great malt depth for the style and pretty good drinkability.

+  Solid work with the malts give this beer a deep caramel and toffee presence 
+  A really good balance between all flavors as well as a moderate bitterness makes this one very easy to drink and to enjoy 
+  The moderate carbonation and the chewy malts combine for a mellow and fluffy mouthfeel that suits this beer really well

Dry and dusty floral aroma, its vaguely sweet, more like a massively floral ESB - even flour.

3735,"2010-12-29",3.3,"On tap at the brewpub. An ""Irish Red Ale"", they hit it on the nose for the appearance here, as red as a beer without food coloring can get, covered by a veil of white foam. Aroma is quite hoppy actually, a mix of english and bittering american hops, there is also a lot of caramel, english bitter-like almost which makes the whole thing quite messy. Taste is decent, good malty sweetness with a bitter hop bite, a few not-too-pleasing cooked vegetable flavors came and went.

3735,"2007-10-11",3.3,"In short: Rich session beer with a bit of many things (liberal interpretation of the style)
How: On tap at Vices & Versa
The look: Dark ruby body with a medium beige head 
In long: Chewy malts, fruity yeast and leafy hops are equally present.  Fruity flavours of grapes, plum and prunes.  A bit sweet but without much caramel flavour, more like residual fruity sweetness.  Hops have a green leafy freshness quality to them.  Fluffy body.  Certainly not what Ive come to expect from an Irish Ale (low on the caramel side and more yeasty than usual) but who cares this is a nice session beer.  A honest beer.  Unlike most internet dating profile it even tells you exactly what it looks like.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

3735,"2006-05-08",3.1,"Any first impressions?
-A veil of head hangs on to the clear mahogany.
-Wooden, smoky subtleties rise from an otherwise quiet aroma.
-Earth-covered berries are surrounded by morning-after campfires.
-The active carbonation is fitting, although just a little less would have allowed more drinkability, methinks.

What if you dig deeper?
-The light bitterness of coffee beans appears serene.
-Caramel comes up again in the nose and flavor, a redundant feature in their lineup.
-A touch of rauch malt was used (confirmed by one of the owners) in an intelligent manner.
-A well-brewed Irish Ale, but how exciting can this style be anyway?
