Medium carbonation. Aromas of dark fruits (raisins, plums) and light toasted malts with hints of spices.

776,"2012-09-19",3.6,"December 6, 2012 - on draught at Les Brasseurs du Temps.  Hazy brownish copper-amber with an average creamy/foamy tan head.  Smells like a dunkelweizen - spicy, sweet and yeasty with apple banana and light floral bitterness; some alcohol (7+).  Taste follows, more bitterness, less sweetness, really well balanced.  Thick, decent carbonation, a medium-length fruity/herbal finish.  Nice.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
776,"2012-06-27",3.4,"On tap at the brew pub/restaurant.
Aroma: Spicy... cloves? Reminds me of resins a mix of floral and herbs.
Appearance: hazy/cloudy, brown, cream colour head making a nice foam, unlike a cream ale though, less thick.
Taste: Typical of the dunkelweizen, I felt ripe bananas, lots of toasted wheat, spices, some crisp caramel notes, earthy wood floor, tree bark, woody hops. 
Palate: feels like a full body, with a oily texture, lively and a nice abrupt dry finish.
Excellent everyday beer. Dominique should sell it to me by the keg for my basement. ;-)","Ontario, CANADA","LBarouf"

776,"2012-02-04",3.5,"My Bottom Line :  
This plump Dunkel Weizen seduces with its clove-y phenols linked to raisin-y sweetness, a pleasurable fruitiness grounded in earthy yeast and wheat.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A slice of foam tops the cloudy dark amber.
-Banana esters are subdued, which is fine by me. Otherwise, the beer would have felt even heavier. 
-The body is a tad rounder than the typical Dunkel Weizen. 
-The flavor profile is quite authentic.
-A tad drier and with fluffier carbonation, this would be superb (in my tastes).

On tap at the brewpub.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

La levure est en retrait au nez, mais on la retrouve en forte quantité en bouche. Assez seche, en dépit de présence du houblon à la fin : relativement crèmeuse pour une Dunkel. Pas très corsée.

How: Tap at brewpub
The look: Cloudy brown body topped by a small off-white head
In long: Nose is a little spicier than usual for the style with strong notes lf cloves.  Taste has the typical dunkelweizen ripe bananas, lots of toasted wheat, spicy sensation (mainly cloves), some crisp caramel, earthy wood floor, tree bark, woody hops.  Finish is pleasantly dry.  Overall a very good representation of the style.  Another good beer from BDT.  Pairs well with their tasty food.
