3913,"2015-04-29",4.0,"Bottle, shared by mydude, @ a location remote of my dining room.
Pours a hot pink color with an admirable head and some nice lacing on the glass.

The aroma is lots of tart fruit & a moderate level of woodiness. The whiskey is pretty faint but knowing its there its impossible to ignore. There is some funk, and a whole lot of blackberry.

The flavor is lots of seedy berries, its plenty sour with a nice woody character. There isnt a ton of whiskey character going on here (thankfully) but the mild bit of whiskey that the beer has in it is pretty well integrated. 
the beer is pretty darn dry. 

The things that its really interesting and tasty, for sure. Although I do suspect I would prefer this beer without the whiskey presence. All things said, it is indeed a really fun take on a barrel aged sour beer that works better than lots of beers that down sound gross when you read the name...","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

3913,"2015-03-14",4.0,"Bottle: Thanks, Jeff! As ""Berry Whiskey Bu"". Muddled, completely cloudy & dense cranberry red & orange-tinted color white a thin foamy head, lavender tinted & quick to settle. Nose of tart berry, lemon skin, lightly sweaty barnyard funk, blackberry, gooseberry, a hint of yogurt & lacto. Flavor is nice & tart; reminds me of the Black Cherry Warheads, but not as sour. More of a balancing fruity sweetness to this one. Still plenty sour, though. Lemon, blackberry, black cherry, raspberry... Tons of berry. Sharp, moderately acidic, a little lactic towards the finish with a small kiss of vinous oak. Delicious stuff.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate blackberries, a touch of lemon, and faint vinous notes. Im not getting whiskey notes in the aroma. It pours a mostly transparent reddish-brown with a two finger pink head that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a thicker ring. The flavor starts with a quick dose of blackberry. The finish turns to heavy mouth puckering sour lemon, citric acid, and a hint of must. I dont get any whiskey in the flavor either. Its light bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, really tasty and really sour.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

3913,"2014-10-18",4.1,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. Thanks Ben! 
Aroma is tart with a touch of lemon yogurt character and a really nice berry character. Faint wheat notes. 
Pours a cloudy red with some purple and brown hues. Large, thin, pinkish head that slowly recedes to the edges where it lingers a bit. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor is moderately acidic with a nice berry flavor. Light wheat character and a touch of lemon. Faint oak but no bourbon. 
Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice tart beer with really nice berry character. Im not sure the bourbon barrels really add much character. A nice Berliner though.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

3913,"2014-08-31",3.8,"Bottle last night courtesy of my buddy Jack. Thank you bro. This dude was at the release a little more than a week ago and his been kind enough to share almost 20 different De garde beers with me over the last 10 months. In any case, this is another fun de garde beer but I dont think its my favorite. It had a lot of nice elements to it with the very tart and fruit blackberry flavor and the mild meaty, whiskey notes not afraid to be known. But for me, the parts are all really nice, but they dont all work so great for me as a whole. Very acetic mouthfeel, akin to the kiwi bu we had earlier in the night and a bit disjointed in the finish. But I am still thrilled to have had another one of these cool beers from one of the more exciting breweries (for me) i have tried in the last few years.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
3913,"2014-08-28",4.2,"(Rating #9,100) Bottle... This beer rocks! Pours cloudy and ruby with a tiny, brief, pink head. The aroma is a touch bready with tons of accompanying blackberry greatness. Full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and Key West carbonation. The flavor is involuntary-eye-squinting sour and fruity - blackberries out the ass. Finishes silly sour, tongue-numbing and fruity. That sourness lingers a good while after each sip. Thanks goes out to landhoney for sharing this world-class Florida Weisse with the South Florida Crew!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
