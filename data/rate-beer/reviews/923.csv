923,"2017-03-26",3.3,"120z Can. Pours a copper color with and off-white head. Aroma of malt sweetness, grain hint of citrus. Taste of malt sweetness, bit caramel, some grain and trace of fruit. Nice bitterness and a fairly dry finish. Moderate body, crisp and bit of a floral feel. Nice, easy drinker.","St. Charles, Missouri, USA","Bif"
923,"2016-11-05",3.2,"Bottle. Aroma bread and caramel malt. Biscuit and caramel malt flavor with a bit of grass/earth in the finish. Clean.","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"
923,"2016-07-04",3.4,"Pour is a dark amber with a small tan head. Aroma is a decent caramel with a bit of hop and a cherry. Flavor is a nice bready and biscuit malt with an ever so slight caramel. This is not as sweet as I thought it was going to be. This was actually quite dry and the malt used really stood out.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
923,"2016-06-19",3.7,"Light amber color. Perfect carbonation...nice aroma. A sweetness I find quite complimentary. I imagine Ive drank a few ""steam beers"" through the years but this is the first I have known to be classified as such.","Illinois, USA","fuzzcro"
923,"2016-06-13",3.3,"Sampler. It poured an amber color with a tan head. The aroma was of malts, rye and some yeast. The taste was similar to the aroma with more malts, rye, yeast and some barley. Good.","Wentzville, Missouri, USA","jandd1983"
923,"2016-04-29",3.2,"12 oz can purchased as part of a mix a six from Friar Tuck in OFallon, Missouri. The pour is a slight haze golden ruby copper with a well formed one inch light tan head and a bunch of carbonation bubbles rising to the surface. The aroma is subdued, some caramel malt, touch of grass, hint of tinny metal. The taste is toasted softly sweet caramel malt, along with the grass floral and then finishing with a touch of the metallic element of the nose. Solid California Common flavors, minus the metallic. The palate is light to medium bodied, normal carbonation and a bit of the sweet in the finish.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
923,"2016-04-26",3.3,"Poured from a 12oz can into nonic pint glass, an oddly hazy medium orange colour with weak off-white foam, no lace. Low aroma but better flavour. Crisp and biscuity maltbill, light caramel with resiny, citrusy, earthy hops, more than I might expect for the California Common style. Nice bittersweet balance, malt sweetness in the middle but finishes dry. Drinkable and easy-going with some subtle complexity. Light-medium body, medium-high carbonation, slight alcoholic warmth. Tasty.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"
923,"2015-12-19",4.0,"Poured from the tap at the brewery. The appearance is semi-murky golden brown with a thin off-white head. Has a faint hop aroma. The taste is a nice hoppy and fruit blend. Overall, a very good beer.","Douglasville, Georgia, USA","ordybill"
923,"2015-08-13",3.7,"Draft:
Clear amber with a creamy beige head.
Caramel malt, rye aroma.
Taste is sweet toffee malt, rye malt.....rye is light and peppery.
Very good, rich and full flavoured for the lightness.","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"
923,"2014-05-16",3.4,"Sampled at the brewpub. Hazed and golden brown. A thin layer of off white foam. Not really much of an aroma but a hold flavor. Hop based. They are fruity and a bit spicy. The rye is noted. The lager yeast does add the different domension that is hoped for but the strong hop backbone makes it unique. A grassy finish. Good stuff rspecially at 4.4 %.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
923,"2014-05-16",3.6,"Pours a slightly hazy dark golden/orange with a nice white head that laces. Earthy aroma. Taste is sweet caramel malt, buttery maple syrup and mild hops.","OFallon, Illinois, USA","wxman"
