Poured out of the bottle a cloudy blonde.  6ºSRM.

Nose is full of wheaty, beery, slighty yeasty aromas.  Very ""lager-like"" nose. No hops.

Mouthfeel is light and sudsy.  Aggresively carbonated.  Palate is raw dough, wheat flour, water biscuits.  There is brief lemon sourness to the palate lending it some depth.

Nice clean abbreviated hop finish.

For me this drank more like a witbier than a Kolsch.","SINGAPORE","drjoeng"

245,"2008-08-17",3.2,"UPDATED: SEP 8, 2008 12oz bottle.   Huge gusher upon opening, with eighty percent head and twenty percent hazy blonde, with plenty of yeast sediment and haze.   After much foam scraping and a good ten minute wait, it is fit for consumption; well, kinda.   Subtle hop spice and bready yeast on the nose.   I swear that there is also an acidic astringency, but it is hard to really tell.   The flavor is super dry with a tart tang and plenty of yeast.   Finishes a little astringent with some hop bitterness.   Extremely carbonated to the point of being almost undrinkable.   Three bottles now, and something is definitely off with this beer.   Im not sure if its infection or a bottle conditioning problem, but it is too dry, too carbonated, and too acidic.   Part of me wanted to like this because the flavor had vague flashes of a demented Orval, but in the end this was just undrinkable.   Hoping that the rest of my sixer managed to avoid this catastrophe. (2.2)    Rerate:   Last bottle of the sixer, and the only one to avoid the huge over-carbonation gushing problem.   Clear gold with a modest white head.   Grassy and spicy nose with a little dough aroma as well.   The flavor has some slightly sweet cracker pale malts, and a good dose of grassy and spicy hops with plenty of bitterness for the style, though not too much in general.

This was refrigerated, however, so Im going to go with it.Bottle consumed over the weekend, 3/22-3/24/2007Extremely frothy, large white head is slow to recede and laces moderately well.  Clarity is high.  Carbonation is forced, with plenty of bubbles in the deep blonde colored body with plenty of straw tones.Grainy and straw-like malt notes right away show dryness in the malt bill, but a honey-vanilla sweetness creeps on the back end.  Soft, fruity and lightly herbal hops are very reserved, though still very aromatic, adding very little bitterness.  No flaws in the aroma, medium strength, no alcohol.I like the variation on the malt flavors; not just all honey, or vanilla-cream or cookieish pale malts.  The light grainy edge really helps break up the sweetness, as well.  Clean yeast, with very low ester production and soft, floral hops with light nectarine/peach fruitiness and some mildly bitter spiciness.  A touch of doughiness and a pretty full body relative to style.  Thats ok though, its better than the beer being watery.  Wow, Drakes really are showing themselves to be in the top tier of brewing malty beers.  Theyve really got their mashing down solid and dont skimp on the malt.  Maybe not as well suited for a pils or blonde ale, though this one was still very enjoyable, and I have yet to have their pils fresh.

It has a lot of the flavors it should, and it doesnt taste unpleasant, but it has that same quality of lacking something that I get out of most american wheats.  I was hoping for something more.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"
245,"2007-01-14",3.7,"Bottle -- thanks, aspedites!

Pours a not-quite-clear gold with a lovely, tight pure-white head.

Soft aroma of grass, bread dough, and a whisper of citrus. This is a subtle beer, but with that expectation in mind the flavor is really a delight - mildly sweet caramel malts atop lemon, plenty of body through the middle, turning spicy on the finish, leaving a lovely hop finish in place. This might not be the style that Id turn to often (especially not in January!) but that said, this beer is really a terrific beer in the style. Drakes continues to impress.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Tastes of bread, some lemon, nice bitterness.   A fine example of the style.  Very good overall.","Ohio, USA","ogglethorp"
245,"2006-11-29",3.6,"12 oz. bottle via trade with IrishBoy - Pours a clear light golden color with a big white head that settles to a faint foam head on the way down.  Nice lacing.  Has a strong toasty, honey, bready malt aroma.  Flavor is bready, light grain, and a touch of citrus.  A smooth, medium body beer.  Bitternes hangs on the palate.  Probably the best Kolsch Ive had.  Nice.  Thanks Richard.","BFE, Arizona, USA","cbkschubert"
245,"2006-11-29",3.2,"Body is a slightly foggy gold, with not much of a head forming.  Aroma is a bit of honey along with floral notes, and a light dose of hops.  Taste is fairly floral and fruity, along with the normal 2 row taste.  Body is too fizzy.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Enniskillen"

245,"2006-10-05",3.8,"Bottle courtesy of beerguy101, thanks again Mitch! Pours a hazy yellow with a bone white head that all but dissapears after a minute or so. Spicy, bready aroma...good amount of yeast...some pepper, lemon zest, and clove. The flavor has some candied fruit, more lemon zest and pepper and a spice I cant put my finger on. Light body over the tounge, though the flavors stick throughout...it never gets thin. The carbonation is nice, present but not overbearing...I could go with a bit more actually. The finish is earthy and dry..a great light offering.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"
245,"2006-09-22",3.7,"Thanks to Milo2 for this: Pours a deep filtered bubbly golden with a pillowy white head. Aroma is bready-sweet malts, no hops and a touch of yeast fruitiness but it is restrained. The body is med.-light, somewhat sweet for the style with a lot of CO2. The flavor is again, bready malts and lots of it. If this is US 2-row then I am VERY impressed. A nice touch of honey in the flavor. Finish is not as crisp as I might like and could use a touch more in the way of bitterness, but this is damn fine. One I could drink a lot of.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","erway"

Im not a big fan of this style, but this brew was easier to drink than any other Ive had in this category. The flavor doesnt overpower, which is nice for this type of brew. The taste is some grassy flavors with a hint of citrus and a very slight spice finish. The mouthfeel is nice, maybe a bit too thin though. Drakes continues to impress me.

Aroma is lightly malty sweet, with hints of citrus and herbs.  The flavor is also lightly sweet, with a slight breadiness accompanying the citrus and herbiness.  Light body and moderate carbonation.

245,"2006-02-07",3.7,"This is incredibly easy to drink. Crisp and refreshing, its a fantastic beer for the summer (eventhough its January) but can be enjoyable anytime of course. The pour is this cloudy golden goodness with a nice foamy head. Aroma is malty, a tad bit spicy (which I loved) and some citrus. Mouthfeel is moderate/full, finish is very clean and smooth. While it was in my mouth there were notes of a sweet, grasy maltiness character that I found really nice with a touch of lemony goodness. Damn, this is a fine beer that should be enjoyed year round.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

245,"2005-05-26",3.0,"Pours light gold with a white head, subdued aroma is sweet and a bit spicy. Opens with a fruity sweetness tempered with a bit of spice and hops, finishes clean. Certainly recognizable as a Kölsch but this brewery has a talent for enhancing and giving some distinction to each style they attempt. If I were a fan of this style I would say that this is one of the best.","Laguna Niguel, California, USA","elnadeau"
245,"2005-05-04",3.2,"(12 oz bottle: BevMo in La Jolla, CA) One of the more flavorful and enjoyable entries in the Kölsch style, its also one of the few Ive sampled that has nice balance and actually shares a few characteristics of a Kölsch.  Fruity and lightly sweet up front, rather like orange citrus, and becoming moderately hoppy and bitter in the finish.  Light body, but not watery, nice and smooth on the palate.  The nose is fruity, but Im not getting much in the way of hops.  Pale golden in color and somewhat hazy in appearance.  White head pours to an average, half-inch height and gradually slims down to a wide halo, leaving a few patches of lace behind.  Still not a style I tend to rave about, but this is a nice, easy drinking, summery beer with actual character.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

The aroma is light, mostly light noble hops. The flavor is bright and crisp, citrusy and straw malt flavors. The hops are very reminiscent of pilsner hops, as is the malt profile. This is light and chuggable but avoids being bland. The quintessential summer beer.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
