1125,"2016-12-31",3.8,"From notes. Enjoyed at a tasting Kyle finally made it to at Mickeys on December 01. 750 mL bottle, 2005 vintage. The pour is a dirty reddish color with a thicker pink head and a couple spots of lace as it falls to a film. This is an interesting thing. There is a plastic VOC thing happening on the nose. There is a light rubber band thing going on that Im not crazy about. There is a good amount of cherry and a nice tartness, but its just not as crisp and clean as I was hoping it would be. The flavor is much of the same. The cherry is a little dry and the VOCs and rubber band are still prevalent. The mouth feel is thicker and syrupy with a brighter carbonation and a lingeringly sweet and tart cough syrup thing happening that just doesnt do it for me. Maybe this needs to be a little fresher.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

1125,"2016-08-24",4.7,"A 750ml bottle at Moeder Lambic Fontainas. There were two conflicting bottling dates. The original label has a bottled on date of 28th April 2010 whereas Moeder Lambic added a 2015 bottling label. Whatever research I could muster up shows that there does appear to be a 2015 bottling on 30th January 2015 out there (first since 2011). Poured into a 3 Fonteinen gueuze glass. It poured a cloudy dark ruby red colour with a big three finger light pink head that dissipated fairly quickly, leaving very sparse lacing. Aromas of very nice fruity cherry and strawberry with a hint of vanilla. Tastes sour, tart, cherry and strawberry with some very light funk. Light bodied with moderate carbonation.

1125,"2016-08-17",4.0,"750 mL bottle. 2008 bottle. Originally reviewed 3/2/2013.

Red body. Not much of a head, but there wasnt much of a pop when the cork came out.

Still has a strong cherry nose. Less of the Drie Fonteinen signature funk. More of a lemony acidity. Hefty oak to it.

Lemon sourness up front. Cherry flavor isnt sweet. More dry and wine like. Finishes very dry and oaky.

Mild sourness. Much more dry than sour. Low carbonation, but that could be age. Mustiness does indicate its age though.

Lacking the Drie Fonteinen complexity, but that cherry flavor is very nice. Thats the point I guess.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

Liquide très clair sans pour autant être cristallin. Aucune mousse ou presque ne survit lorsque le liquide est versé dans mon verre. Ce lambic est probablement le lambic fruité le plus clean - pour emprunter lexpression qui décrit le mieux cette bière, quil ma été donné de déguster. Le fruit ayant tombé avec le temps, il demeure dans cette boisson une cerise délicate qui se conjugue parfaitement à une touche boisée et claire. Le funk présent est délicat, laissant place à des saveurs bien précises de fruit dété. Rien ne vient brouiller les cartes, pas même une leffervescence pour nous distraire.

Flavour is tart and medium-high acidic with sour cherry flesh, light red wine, a touch of lemon lacto and acetic acid. Some real leafy/herbal notes as well.

More herbal/grassy notes on the finish too, a bit spicy and lightly tannic. Medium bodied with quite low carbonation.

1125,"2013-05-25",3.9,"Poured into a tulip. Vintage of 25/04/2011 with a best before of 04/2016. This is the van schaerbeekse krieken version.

3.5 A: Well hazed cherry plum color. Just about a finger of frothy pink head. Retention isnt great and no lacing is left.

4.5 S: Big, bold tart cherry - very welcoming. Like most 3F brews, this has a minimal acetic sourness and plenty of funk. Tangy fruity funk from lactic acid, musty basement, sweat socks, dry dusty wood planks. Light mixed berry noes underneath. Oak with a touch of vanilla. Touch of garbage-like funkiness to round this out. Very complex in the funk department and great interplay with the cherry. I guess I could use a little more sourness, but Id take this any day over Cantillons ass-puckering sourness.

4.5 T: The taste gives a nice tart punch that wasnt present in the nose. Theres also more acetic sourness that I would have expected if you know what I mean when I differentiate between tartness and sourness. Cherry is definitely a big part of the taste and is quite potent. Just enough sweetness to balance the sourness. The funk, however, either isnt as strong as in the nose or is just hidden behind the rising components of the taste. However, the funk is still easily detectable and adds to the complexity quite a bit, it just isnt as strong as in the nose. Musty basement, apple orchard, sweat socks, and dry wood. Oak with plenty of vanilla. Very nice.

3.5 M: Lighter medium body. Carbonation is on the lower end, but is fine. The issue I have is that the carbonation isnt very spritzy, which is something I like in these sort of styles. Light creaminess. Super smooth.

4.0 D: Another quality beer from 3F. A funk lovers kriek to be sure.

1125,"2012-11-07",4.0,"Poured from a 2011 750 mL bottle into a tulip.

There is a soft pop as the cork is released, and the pour into my glass has an energetic level of carbonation.  The beer itself is a hazy dark pink rapsberry color throughout, with a few resplendent bubbles visibly rising from the bottom of glass.  A gentle off-white head relaxes to a ring around the edge for most of the glass.

A robust cherry aroma is not overly strong but is definitely the most noticeable aroma.  At first the cherries seem sweet and creamy, but there is a slightly sharp tartness that adds a little bit of an edge.   Lemony lambic notes, tannic cherry skin, and some oaky red wine notes.  As it warms the farmyard funk comes through, although it is not dominant by any means.

The Schaerbeekse cherries come through immediately.  Once the fruit base is set, the tartness starts to build, bringing in notes of lemon and oak, and a bit of tannic vinous fruit.  The lambic in the form of lactic acidity and the sweet cherries play off of each other for the majority of the sip.  Just a bit of Bretty funk adds a background complexity.  There is a mineral note in the finish.   

As compared to some other fruit lambics, this has a somewhat richer body and creamier nature.  The carbonation is smooth and gentle as opposed to crisp, which makes it feel undercarbonated at times.  In reality, it is simply more of a subtle carbonation to go along with its subtle flavor.  Even though it is tart and sour, I do not sense that it is overly acidic.

I enjoyed drinking this Kriek for sure.  My fruit lambic preference goes to Cantillon, but this is a serious lambic.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

1125,"2012-08-11",4.3,"Finally splurged on this $40 bottle. 2010 vintage. Very excited to try this. It pours a nice deep red color with a quickly dissipating pink head. The aroma is very intense with minerals and cherry skin. Hints of blue cheese and oak give it some nice complexity. The flavor is huge up front with sour cherries with some hints of sweetness for balance. On first sip, the relatively low carbonation is very welcome and lets the flavors come out more. There is some leather and a tiny bit of cheesy funk, but this is really all about the sour cherries. The finish is really amazing as it hits the back of your tongue and draws the mouthwater with huge sour character. No vinegar at all. Oak aging is evident, but complements rather than stand out. Overall, a really really nice sour cherry lambic. The Schaerbeekse cherries live up to the billing!","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
1125,"2012-07-30",4.0,"Thanks to foofaa for bringing this one to ffej of july. Not sure of the year but definitely a recent vintage. Served alongside an original 2003 Drie Fonteinen Kriek.

A - Pours bright ruby red with a nice one finger tall white head leaving spotty streaks of lace down parts of the glass.

S - Smells of fresh sour cherries, wet oak, musty basement funk and a bit of sugary sweetness. The cherries dominate the nose from start to finish.

T - This one is sour cherries through and through. Hints of musty basement, barnyard funk, bit of sugar and plenty of oak offer some some contrast but the cherries are never far from the front. Finish is dry, lingering on the palate long after consumption.

M - Smooth body with a ton of flavor and moderate carbonation. Tart feel with a touch of sweetness, pretty dry toward the end of each sip.

O - This is what I am looking for when I want a true kriek. The cherries are intense yet the sour funk keeps them in check. This bottle reminds me that I need more of these asap.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

1125,"2012-07-09",4.6,"Bought a 750 mL bottle of this from Lukas Liquor, Manager suggested this was their best but $36 for this!?!? Had to buy it. Served in a champagne soupe.

Appearance - Ruby Red, not much head like other lambics...

Smell - Awesome Sour/Tart scent, of course cherries as well.

Taste - Tart and Sour but not as fruity as some Lambics. Has a more sour taste than others. A very mild hint of Cherry. 

Mouthfeel - Medium mouthfeel, has both a crisp and tart puckering effect, and champagne-like. 

Drinkability - Great Beer! Not worth $36 for a 750 mL but worth trying. I still promote the Cantillon Cherry Kriek if looking for a great Lambic. This one only being $20-25 depending on where you purchase it.","Ballwin, Missouri, USA","DConMan"

Bang! Thar she blows! The first thing I noticed about this beer was that it blew up all over Brads kitchen. We hastily got the remainder of the bottle into our tasting glasses.

3F Schaerbeekse Kriek pours a very rich and beautiful shade of red with a huge head that fades rather quickly and leaves no trace of lacing behind. Very tart cherry scents fill the olfactory senses from several feet away. There is a great funkiness to this beer that has developed over the six years it spent in the cellar. The taste is musty and sour with tart cherries - truly delicious. The mouthfeel is very nice, with mild acidity present in the finish. There was still plenty of fruit present after six years. I recommend aging this great fruit lambic, as it will only get better.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
1125,"2012-07-04",4.5,"Bottle. Sampled this side-by-side with a bottle of RR Supplication and a bottle of 3 Fonteinen Oude Kriek. Poured a clear deep ruby, cranberry juice color. The head was thin and white. Oak and red wine nose. A wine enthusiast would surely cringe, but the aroma was vaguely reminiscent of a pinot noir. In comparison, the Oude Kriek was more cherry syrup-like. Light to medium bodied and moderately acidic without any significant sugars. Red wine vinegar, unripe berries, and oak flavors. Very well put together. While similar, Supplication had lemon, lime, and candy notes which were not present in the others. The Oude Kriek was thicker and a bit more syrup-like with a stronger dark cherry flavor.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"

Nose: red Froot Loops, sour candy cherries, mild mustiness and funk, unripe cherry juiciness. Fairly simple.
Mouth: carbonation is a bit thin, and bright citric/malic acidity is a little too high for me. I think I generally prefer older bottles because of the carbonation/acidity balance. The funk is a little low for me, this is very fresh and bright, and a little simple. Pomegranate earthiness, and a little pitty/pithy bitterness. Yeastier pour is a little more mellow, and integrates the flavors better, as well as bringing out a bit of caramelly oak notes.

1125,"2012-04-01",4.2,"Picked this up for $30 USD at Hunger Mountain Co-Op. Bottle April 26th, 2011. Poured into a white wine glass right from my cellar at 55 Degrees F. Shared with the GF who LOVES Kriek Lambic.

A - Nice hiss on the cork pop but not an intense pressure I expected. Poured a 2-finger off-red head with big bubbles that dissipates instantly in my glass. Deep blood red color beer with some nice bubbles in the glass. Theres some slight alcohol fingers on the glass which is surprising for a low ABV beer.

S - Gigantic funkiness on first sniff. Lots of tang and tart in that first bit of sniff. The cherries come into the scent soon after followed by some wood and earthy notes that I imagine was passed on from the barrel aging. The tartness feels like it burns my nose hairs its so strong.

T - Gigantic mouth puckering sour taste turns my tongue upside down. Pretty amazing. The cherry is there but not as intense as expected. Theres a great oak taste on the back of my tongue and cherry / oak is left over after swallowing. The sour is so intense so if youre not in LOVE with sour, this will put you on your butt.

M - A big mouth swish gives me 60/40 bubbles to liquid. Great linger of the cherries and very light bodied.

O - Worth $30? Id say so if youre a big sour lover. The same bottle costs a lot less in Belgium but then theres that pesky plane ticket. I think this is a great beer but $10 cheaper would have been nice.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

The cherries are also big up front on palate but are immediately swept away by the oaky tannins and earthy funk.  The sugar and cherries are still there but the tartness is a little more pronounced.

I could do with a bit less carbonation but it isnt unbearable by any means. I was able to buy this for $22 before the price hike and it was well worth the cost of admission.","Commerce Township, Michigan, USA","DrDoitchbig"

The sourness isnt totally mouth puckering but something that would be easy to have a full glass of.  Overall, an outstanding beer as always from 3F.

Aroma is mild, a little sweet and not too bitter and as I was preparing for similar taste I was very surprised to find that flavor is precisely the opposite -- bitter with no hints of sugars. The feel on the palete is still very mild. Leaves a nice light finish with hints of cherries. Often I can sense metallic off-flavors in some cheaper and less-developped lambics (gueuzes mainly, but sometimes krieks, too).

A - Deep red body, very clear and juice like. I gave it an aggressive pour for the second glass and I got an off white/light pink head that fizzled away in seconds. Pouring the swirled dregs yields a cloudy dark pink/red liquid that looks like a raspberry smoothie. 

S - Sweet cherries followed by some brett funk. The cherry is very potent but sweet with hints of vanilla and cinnamon. Just very light and faint spices. The finish is oaky and sour.

T - Sour cherries followed by oak and brett funk. Very smooth and refreshing flavor. I can pick out some of that vanilla and cinnamon. Some lemony lactic action going as well. Tart and crisp carbonation. 

O - A fantastic kriek. It has a lot of complex sweetness to balance out the sour and tart flavors. I enjoyed it much more than the standard oude kriek, but the price tag is really difficult to swallow. Still glad I grabbed a bottle though.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Aroma is loaded with deep tart cherry notes, funky sock, hay, country side, and  a touch off wood.  Flavor is absolutely delightful.  Very much a two layered experience. The dominant base flavor is an intensely tart cherry note that starts strong and then slowly fades without every really going away.  The other flavor that is present throughout is clean funk and light wood.  This is so well balanced and refreshing.  The tart flavor is such that I just want another sip after each is finished.

1125,"2011-06-07",4.4,"Had the 2005 version recently, my original review was for the 2009. It much improves with age.

There is more bitterness and sourness, its better incorporated into the overall beer. Its just a better beer. The flavors pop more, its not sweet, there is no aftertaste. Several years on this beer is a good thing.

Beer is dark red, forms a head of small pink bubbles that leaves some but not a lot of lacing on the glass. Its dark and hazy, looks great.

Aroma is pretty sour, almost ammonium in aroma, a very slight tinge of something bad. Overall, pretty good with one bad note.

Beer is quite sour, lots of lactic and some citric. Acetic is lesser but is still there. The cherries are not as forward as I would have wanted. I think the off aroma I was smelling was actually the cherry flavor. Second taste, not as tart as I want it to be, its like a big red gueze with a fruity aftertaste. Interesting.

Wonderful aroma that means only one thing... LAMBIC! Casual aromas that waft up from the glass are wonderful fruity cherry vapors. When you smell deeply thought, the lambic aroma hits you in and teleports you right to Beersel. I drift between the aromas of chewy cherry and wonderfully sour lambic. I almost hate the fact I have to stop smelling it to actually drink it. Almost... 

Murky red brown color with a head that disappeared long before I was done smelling it. 

Smooooooooth... Wow! Almost nothing up front. Then the sourness creeps up on you. Then the cherry arrives at the party. Clean and dry. No puckering, no bitterness, no astringency, just pure lambic loveliness that is almost understated. The cherry is very subtle, unlike the syrup infused krieks. I will have to drink it sooner the next time it is available to enjoy more cherry flavor. Still, this is not a brute of a lambic like some others, it is very refined and subdued instead of in-your-face. I really wish I was drinking this in Beersel at some cafe.  Make no mistake, I enjoy those in-your-face, Im a real lambic and Im going to kick your ass with my lambicness, kind of lambics, but this one is gentle and easy drinking. I just wish it had a touch more cherry flavor. But wtf, Armand Debelder is the master so Im going to bow to his mastery and say this is perfectly balanced. Which of course it is.","Missouri, USA","MissouriBrent"

1125,"2011-03-28",3.4,"Ive been wrong every day for the last 2 years. The missus went off to Brugge for the weekend with the girls...and written instuctions to bring me one beer back (if she brought me any)...this one. She paid 16 Euros for the bog standard kriek in one of those criminally overpriced Brugge places, I scoffed at it, berated her for her generosity and shoved it under the stairs for 2 years, occasionally opening the door to gaze longingly at my kriek, thinking "" if only it was the Schaerbeekse"". Long story short: Im an idiot who doesnt understand what 35% means, doesnt understand the production methods involved in the making of lambic-fruit, have been unknowingly stockpiling 3 Fonteinen Schaerbeekse Kriek for 2 years and owe the missus a BIG apology.

Saliva-making aroma of 1 cherrydrop dissolved in a vat of lime juice...hints of funk, Brie rind dampness and crab apple..more cherry than the standard Kriek. Massive, nausea-inducing tartness towards the bottom of the first tumbler lingering on the lips like undiluted lime juice...hints of ink, damp wood, cheesy hop, cherry.

A bright, slightly pink-hued ruby. A half-finger rim of baby-pink head lines the edge of the glass, leaving minimal lacing. A second and third pour produces a more substantial, big-bubbled head, but it still leaves a little wanting. Almost no lacing.

This is a fairly fruit-forward lambic, as it was bottled less than two years ago. Bright, almost citrusy cherry, raspberry, minor notes of cheesy funkiness. A great balance of tart and sweet. 

Some mustiness from a combination of the oak-aging and bacteria. The sweetness, though explicitly absent, provides a nice counter to the woodiness. Pleasantly and lightly tart vis-a-vis some citrus and cherry. 

Fairly light, with medium-high carbonation. A little dry finish on the finish.

If it werent for the lack of head retention, this would be one of the most beautiful beers Ive seen. According to the 2010 Lambic Summit, Schaerbeekse cherries are not as sour as American sour/pie cherries.

1125,"2010-12-19",4.3,"Bottle from Vinmonopolet in Valkendorfsgate, Bergen. Pours a hazy, near-murky pink body with a small, pinkish-white head. Nose is sour cherries, wood, and brett tones; all very subtle but highly inviting. The first sip proves to be interesting: at first, it appears sweet and bubbly on the palate, with cherries and funky brett flavors: farmstead hay, basement yeast, hints of hay. Then, the whole thing dissipates into a delicious, intensely sour, tart assault on the senses, before finally converging with the initial cherry-and-brett flavors. Extremely well composed, like a symphony of taste where each section of the orchestra know exactly when to appear and make an impact. Sour tarty cherry flavors go hand in hand with a very nicely balanced sweetness all the way through the aftertaste. The Schaerbeekse Kriek distinguishes itself with having a lot of cherry flavor while avoiding the pitfalls of the potentially sickening, artificial-like cherry sweetness of other krieks - even those using only natural ingredients. Truly a great brew, and by far the best Ive had in the genre. Gotta get more of those bottles before theyre gone!","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

1125,"2010-11-30",4.2,"Bottled in October 2008. Consumed 03.15.2010.

A: Pours a bright ruby red with a nice light pink head that eventually settles into a nice ring around the edge of the glass.

S: Lots of cherries alongside a little bit of sweetness. The cherry component of this one has held up quite well over the year-and-a-half since it was bottled. Behind the cherry is a little bit of lactic acid alongside some oak. The cherry definitely takes the center stage, which diminishes what could otherwise be a fairly complex lambic.

T: Again, lots of cherries upfront. Here, however, the oak and lactic sourness come more into play. As Drie Fonteinen intended, there is no acetic acid in this one, leaving the lactic and cherry to play off one another nicely, with just the slightest touch of oak in the background.

M: Thin and refreshing with moderate carbonation. More acidic on my tongue than cheeks and throat, but a very nice mouthfeel nonetheless. Not super-sour, but also not terribly sweet.

D: Low abv with a near-perfect level of lactic sourness. This is one to be savored, but one that I could easily knock back a few of.

Pours a clear deep ruby red beer, little pink adhesive head. Aroma holds the bretta, some citrus, green apples. But no cherries in the nose. Taste has citrus, quite some acidity but still fruity. Aftertaste holds more of the same. I dont know why, but for some reason this is missing out on the fruitiness of cherries. Maybe the bottle... it calls for a re-tasting.

1125,"2010-08-11",4.4,"Bottle, shared with mrbunn.  Pours a murky, cloudy, foamless hue the color and consistency of pomegranate juice.  Aroma is flat sour berries... maybe a touch of green apple sneaking in there, but mostly, fermented berries.  First taste is an initial blast of sour, but then seems to level off, too quickly, to a semi-flat taste, almost watery.  2nd taste... completely different.  It holds the sour taste much longer, and reveals a pretty excellent balance.  Mouthfeel is medium, and the beer really coats the tongue.  Pretty good stuff, but I am going to reserve judgement until it warms up more, as I suspect there is a lot hidden behind the overly chilled state of the beer at the moment.   Okay, after letting it warm some more, the flavors really come out and the ultra sour, followed by semi-flatness, is gone.  Palate is lovely, cherry, pomegranate sour, followed by a red grape sweetness, and a final settled return to gentle sour that is really quite pleasing.  Nice one.

1125,"2010-05-01",4.5,"July 2007 Bottle Date; Sampled March 2010, lightly chilled at approximately 60*F / 15*C.
A soft pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a two finger thick, pink hued, darkly off-white colored head.  The beer is a deep red color with hints of plum and purple to it.  When held up to the light it shows a brilliantly clear bright red hue, and interestingly enough, it shows lots of bubbles that are slowly moving up through this beer, struggling as if this is a viscous brew.  The aroma smells of light urea and sharp lactic acid up front.  This is followed by phenolic, slightly medicinal notes that have a hint of a plastic edge to them, but there is also a funky, musty, moldy quality to the aroma as well.  Tannic cherry skin aromatics as well as some perfume like cherry pulp fruitiness adds to the complexity, but remain subtle compared to the other notes.  As the beer warms, complex cherry aromatics become more noticeable, as does a deeper, rustic, farm-yard funkiness.

Definitely somewhat thick feeling, but not nearly as much as the slowly rising carbonation suggested.  There is a deep, complex, rich, expressive cherry flavor to this beer despite it being quite dry.  The fruit and some phenolic notes mix to suggest a touch of childrens aspirin-like flavors in the finish.  A chewy, flavorful, cherry-skin note adds tannic astringency as well as concentrated cherry notes to the lingering finish.  This has a nice light sourness, at least for this sour-head, as I wouldnt describe it as a hard lambic.  The acidity seems predominantly a smooth mix of fermentation derived lactic acid and acidity from the tart cherries.  I really like the rich, palate coating texture that this has, despite being well carbonated it has a creaminess to it that is quite nice; this is really just such a lush beer that is quite exquisite for numerous reasons.  Lambic funkiness adds light urea notes, musty cob-web flavors and some medicinal notes to the finish.  As the beer warms a floral cherry flavor, as well as a hint of sweetness become more noticeable.

This is a very nice beer that is aging extremely gracefully; the lush texture, incredibly smooth, but ample acidity, rich cherry flavors and stunning visual presentation are among the highlights of this beer.  The aroma could certainly be more complex, especially expressively fruity (but fruit aromatics are so easily lost with age).  It is quite impressive how rich and toothsome that the cherry flavors are despite this beer being quite dry; this really speaks to the quality of the cherries used to make this beer.  Damn, I definitely wish I had a case of these in the cellar; this beer blows the Hommage I just had out of the water by a long-shot.  If I really had to complain I could wish for a bit more acidity and some more Brettanomyces funkiness, but really that is just being greedy.
Sampled at Drie Fonteinen Cafe 2001
This beer uses the same type of cherries as the draft version that I sampled (Schaerbeek), but that is where the similarity ends.  The bottled version is dry, sour and has a bit of cherry in the nose.  It is definitely not sweet and the cherry is not too apparent in the flavor.  The Kriek is the typical deep red color and was quite tasty.  Of course there is the Lambic flavor present to balance and enhance the subtle cherry flavor.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
1125,"2010-04-30",4.2,"Deep maroon color with a small pink head. The aroma is invigorating with strong notes of the sour yeast, like a Belgian lambic on juice. The cherries come in the flavor, but are still dominated by the tart, or rather they enhance the tartness and flavor. The usual, but smoother, vinegar notes are present. Wow - a delicious sour for the record after all the hype.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"

Taste - biting sourness, clean cherry flavor, wood, lemons, funky cheese, stomach acid...wonderful.

Palate - not nearly as mouth stripping that some lambic/gueuze can be, but its powerful none the less.

Overall - this beer really lets the cherry flavor shine, without being a candy mess that most cherry beers tend to be.

1125,"2010-01-20",4.4,"750ml bottle vintage 2008 from K&L generously shared by alfrantzell on BA. Thanks a lot, Arne! This is one of the more difficult names to spell, as evidenced by the fact that its spelled differently on BA vs. RB. Both sites do agree, however, that its a damn fine beer, and I also agree with this assessment.  Pours a deep, clear crimson color with a decent pink head that bubbles away fairly quickly.  Aroma is loads of tart cherries, oak, and funkiness, including my favorite aroma: horseblanket. Its like they took an old blanket off the dirtiest, sweatiest horse in the barn and threw it right into the fermenter. I love it.  Flavor is also really awesome and heavy on the cherry. Somewhat sour with brett and lacto/pedio. Very earthy and oaky. More funky horseblanket and definite hints of other cloths used to cover various livestock and zoo creatures, whatever those may be.  Dry, acidic, and lively on the palate. Medium body. Exactly to style on the mouthfeel.  Drinkability is good but not quite outstanding. Overall though, this beer is outstanding.

Pours a lightly hazy deep ruby with a small, effervescent head that is just the faintest shade of pink. The aroma has lots of the typical 3F funky brettanomyces character, surprisingly subtle and well blended cherry, and obvious lactic and subtle acetic character. The first sip sends waves of puckering acidity rolling through my mouth that lingers for some time after swallowing. Once my palate gets used to the onslaught, the admittedly faded cherry flavor is apparent. The funk is definitely there, but this beer is just straight up sour cherries and intense acidity.

1125,"2008-06-15",4.2,"750 ml bottle dated 22 March 2006.  Lambic is probably the style I have the most problem with in terms of understanding and appreciating the beer.  Some are just way too sour and acidic for me and I dont understand the attraction.  Ive recently read more about the process of making lambics to try a gain a better understanding of this style and appreciate the subtleties.  In short, this beer was an utter gem.  Pours an absolutely gorgeous rose/plum color with a moderate, fizzy pink head that disappeared after a few sips.  The body starts out cloudy but is fairly clear towards the end of the glass.  The aroma is mostly sour with some cherry notes picked up as well.  No oak detected.  The flavor of this beer simply amazed me.  Sour up front, but not mouth puckering, followed by tart cherries, some light oak, and yeast.  No single component overwhelms any of the other characteristics.  Very effervescent and lively on the tongue.  I shared this bottle with my wife, and she is not into sour flavors at all, and she was equally effusive about this beer.

1125,"2008-06-11",4.3,"750 ml bottle consumed on 6/5/08.  Ive been holding onto this one for quite awhile.  A warm spring evening playing horseshoes seemed like the perfect opportunity to open this kriek.  Pours reddish pink with a pink soapy head that lingers.  The nose is phenomenal.  Sour fruit everywhere.  Lots of tart cherries and raspberries.  Acidic fruit thats almost gueze like. Acidic and vinegary cherry flavors with cherry skins.  There is a slight barnyard character with earthy herbal notes that come out more as it warms up.  The slightly sweet cherries, lactic tartness, and earthiness all balance out each other really well.  Excellent lambic I could drink more of.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"
1125,"2008-06-10",4.3,"Bottle enjoyed with dessert at Heeren van Liedekerke, Belgium (3/2008); unsure of the vintage.  Smells of vinegar and cherry skins, showing the acidity and the fleshiness of the cherries.  Immediately after the first sip, theres a charge of bretty, guezue-like sourness that cuts through the foamy carbonation.  The charge subsides just as quickly, to be replaced by a full cherry flavor that is wonderful and puts many other krieks to shame.  The cherry lingers into the finish and provides the baseline with which the other flavors interact:  a dry yeasty bitter on top of the tongue and on the sides in the beginning, followed by soft lactic sweetness.  Dark yeasty things play around throughout, and are a wonderful complement to the main event: the perfect balance between ripe cherry fruitiness and the guezue-sour juiciness.  Clear ruby red in the glass, pink fizzy head medium to small, but lasting.  Wonderful beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"
1125,"2008-06-02",3.9,"My bottle is one of the newer labels, or maybe just the American distributors label, but whatever the cause, I simply love this label design.  Oh yeah, the beer inside is fantastic too.  The head begins the beer on a plain note - a simple layer of coral pink.  But from this unassuming gaseous crust comes a tart and tangy vapor, stemming even deeper into the pomegranate seed, crimson core.  One deep pull into my olfactory and my teeth begin to chatter with a mix of anticipation and fear of the sweet and tart beer to come.  Vinegar, simple and sweet, takes control of my nose, with a side of dry gauze and leather.  Simple enough.  It is then time to taste, where I am immediately crestfallen by its blandness.  A few seconds pass, though, and the beer is reclaimed in the name of good brew with its skillfully composed aftertaste.  It begins with a moderate tartness, followed by a slightly more intense tongue scraping astringency, before the storm smoothes over and reveals a glowing but subtle note of dark cherries.  Simple, but effective.  A bit of warmth does wonders too, giving that initial tart a little more depth and a little less screech, and makes the luscious cherry touch even more luscious.  Almost impossible, I say, but its done.  A fantastic drink at higher degrees of thermal investment.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

1125,"2008-05-04",4.4,"bottled 22 march 2006, consumed 04 may 2008.  pours a deep nearly opaque burgundy, with a smallish pink head that sticks around better than ive ever seen on a lambic.  initial aromas are almost gueze-like, with sharp lemon and orange zest playing with traces of barnyard.  but theres a distinct yet subtle dark cherry note there which, when combined with the yeast and malt effects, give it a very vinous nose.  the cherries come out a lot more in the taste, for great effect.  as you acclimate to the puckering sour and wild yeast by-products, it has a great dark, sour cherry flavor that reminds me of childhood contests to see who could spit the pit the farthest.  all the usual actors are there, the funky citrus zest, a light woody note, and hints of malt, but the cherries dominate.  its great:  theyre not overwhelming in their sharpness, but they stand out just for how great they taste.  long, sour, dry finish (i love how these beers have an excellent fruit flavor without the accompanying sweetness), smooth as silk, and a surprising amount of bubbles.  light-medium body.  absolutely superb!  best kriek ive tried.  possibly the best lambic ive had.  immense complexity, divine flavor, supremely drinkable; i cant find any flaws.","pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","hiddenvariable"

1125,"2008-04-24",3.5,"I had relatively high hopes which were not realized.  Aside from all the normal adjectives, its really, really dry, a little too much so, like a white wine, with a mouthfeel just as thin.  Some nice lemon rind flavors, but the cherry is so sour and remote, it was kind of unimpressive.

1125,"2008-04-23",4.3,"Bottled 22 March 2006.  Pours electric red with a thin pink-white skirting of foam.  Aroma offers a  tart but somewhat mild cherry presence, which provides a pleasant glaze for a body full of stinky, cheesy yeasts, balsamic vinaigrette, cobwebs, basement air, and airy raspberry fruitiness.  Late warmth of cinnamon and apples.  Flavor is juicy and warm and vibrant; softly funky, bearing an imposing but never overbearing figure, full of character.  A vast wash of sour and pungent fruit characer; unripened mango, sour cherry, orange rind, strawberry, all soaked in the lemony tang and mold of wilderness rain.  It isnt so much the confronting tartness of the cherries as it is the erudite nuances of brown spice on citrus that makes this seem so stunningly innovative.  Minerals and aged balsamic in the tangy, earthy mid palate; hints of dried tomato and salt beneath a merciless wash of acetic acid.  Palate is frothy and full, lively, cottony, punchy, dank, old; perfect.  Finishes with a furious barren dryness on the dregs of lime, vinegar and sour cherry; tangy, ebullient sourness, distant darting spices and sawdusty, moldy funk coat the mouth.  Full of surprises and of foreign, unexpected complexities; a rewarding start to finish experience.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

I am going to take my time with this one as I need to get the full range of temperature.  As it warms, it takes on all the senses, making a major impact all over the mouth.  Not just sour on the tongue, but the whole mouth reacts with a pucker.  More earthiness as it warms.  I smell my old backyard with tons of leaves on the ground on a very wet fall day.  There are moments in the flavor that I find it to be sweeter than I first thought  only to be thrown back to the sour side after an additional pour.  The palate is lively and pleasant.

A minimal, fizzy pink head settles quickly to a wispy film with a sharp edge.  Minimal thin lines and small spots mark the glass.  The aroma is heavy on sour dark cherries, blackberries, new oak, and a touch of smokiness.  The signature Drie Fonteinen farmhouse funk is omnipresent, though its probably a bit more subdued than it is in some of their other brews.  The flavor was of cherry preserves, tons of oak, sour, funky farmhouse yeast.  There is a strong berry presence, which makes it feel pretty jammy overall.

1125,"2007-12-18",3.9,"March 1st, 2005 bottle. Excellent kriek aroma with a horseblanket and wet hay mixed with sweet tart cherries and tannic cherry pits. Surprisingly light carbonation, giving this an almost watery mouthfeel. That much is unfortunate. I did have a moderately difficult time rousing a head on the pour, but did get one, which faded quickly into a very thin ring of foam, pinkish in color, atop the hazy purple of the beer itself. Theres a nice hard acidity to this without being over the top, and its not really all that sweet. The cherries are just there, complementing the flavors but not really on equal footing. Very dry, slightly tannic finish, perhaps shows a little bit of oak here. A little brett funk is apparent in the middle between the initial sourness and the woody finish, but you really have to concentrate for that one.

1125,"2007-12-09",4.3,"Corked and caged bottle from boboski - thanks!  Bottled 01 March 2005, consumed 09 December 2007.  Deep Burgundy pour really lets off a lot of air - not exactly aggressively carbonated, but still very active.  Very fine, teeny tiny bubbles compose the dense layer of pink, lacing head.  Rush of sour cherry (with a touch of sweetness) and wild fermentation.  Taste is strong sour with an even stronger woody dryness, but theres no sense of aggression or histrionics.  Sour cherries prominent here but the general sense is more of fruit than cherry.  Puckering acidity, but again, not overdone.  Its interesting to find something with such a robust, complex taste and such a blunted after; the sour and tart notes fade almost immediately, and what little sweetness there was in the main course is nowhere to be found in the finish.  Medium-full body on the heftier side of style, with a short dry, wooden aftertaste.  Smooth and superbly balanced ... exudes class.  About as solid as they come.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
1125,"2007-12-04",4.1,"Small serving during 11-30-07 tasting at the Lex-Larp Cellars as I joined joet and the Twin Cities crew. Poured from a 750 mL bottle. Sharp, tangy, yeasty aroma features fruit sweetness. Pours a cool looking, hazy red with a light pink head. Awesome, sharp, sour taste. Very dry and wine-like. Reminds me of a great pink champagne. Raspberry flavor; if I didnt know this was a kriek, Id have sworn it was a framboise. Thats okay because I prefer raspberries to cherries anyway. Tangy aftertaste. Light to medium body. Soft in the palate. This is a well-made, interesting, and delicious brew. I wish I had more to say about it, but this is the 12th of 13 beers I had that night in the tasting, and as anyone who has taken notes on a bunch of beers in one day knows, they tend to get sloppy and cursory toward the end, not to mention the burnt-out palate phenomenon.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Pours blood read with a bubbly, pink head. Nose is full of wild and black cherries. Sour flavor is restrained by a surprising layer of hoppy and acidic bitterness, makes a tasty, harmonious balance.

This was my final sample of the night before taking off for home.  I was glad to give it a try.  It reinforces my desire to hunt down a bottle for myself despite the price tag.  Perhaps once I clear some room in the cellar Ill go ahead and pull the trigger next time I am in Ann Arbor.  Those of you in Europe who can get this cheaply should consider yourself lucky.
Aroma / Appearance - The body was a rich cherry red (almost like Belgian Red but with more head).  Tart cherries created an intensely sour nose.  Unlike some Cantillon products though it was not strong enough to turn my stomach.
Flavor / Palate - Very sour acidic cherries was the primary star of this sample.  It did not immediately attack the lining of my stomach like Lou Pepe Kriek but it was very close.  This is definitely one for sipping unless you have a cast iron stomach.  I will definitely have to try to get this again for a special occasion.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The taste is unripe cherry with its dull sourness that sticks to the back of the tongue, almost a saltiness.  I do not see this as overly complex; I mean, I am trying to look for other flavors, but I really cant detect anything but the subtle cherry and unripe profile therein contained.  Someone said coconut, and actually, I am starting to see that- a slight milkiness in the aftertaste that is very coconut-like.  Other than that, not very complex, but solid.

Tastes a bit like eating un-ripe cherries. There is also some funk that becomes noticeable about midway. At the finish I start to notice a growing wood essence.

This has a lot more subtle qualities that most fruit lambics and has a high level of complexity  While this comes with a very high price tag, I have to give it a  HUGE thumbs up  for being an over-the-top wonderful lambic.  I will have to get another before too long.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

Aroma of sour cherry and oak is pretty dominant and overly enjoyable. Taste is a mix between some sour cherry, tart and oaky notes are also very present. I thought the level of acidity was quite low or at least well balance that it was not getting in the way.

Subtle beer - not overpowering - but mustiness is the major component and I expected more.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
1125,"2007-03-30",4.4,"Large, frothy, bright pink head has moderate retention. Thick bulbous lacing sticks like glue. The body is deep cherry red, creamy looking. Aroma brings dark cherries that are both overripe and sensuously tart. Also noted are heapings of barnyard funk, horse blanket, milder vanilla and wet oak, milder still nuances of astringent lemon oils and musty moss. Flavor is actually dialed down a notch, so relaxing and ultimately stunning in its complexities. Cherries are both sweet and tart, boldly presented as a centerpiece enveloped in funk. Moderate acidity is cloaked by outright sourness with toasty grains and brettanomyces. This is the pinnacle of kriek. Sweet, high-end Kirschwasser and tart oakiness linger in a finish thats much milder than the taste. Palate is silky smooth with boisterous carbonation that fits well. Medium bodied mouthfeel is presented so elegantly it becomes hard not to take large gulps. 

My rating for this has near the same score as the oude kriek, but for entirely different reasons. This kriek defines the style. The way it exudes elegance is comforting and fulfilling. A knockout.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Aroma is reminiscent of the proper aroma for a lambic with a woody cherry direction.  The taste is certainly full of cherries and is sweet with some tartness at the end of the sip.  I agree with ross where is the sour.  This is damn good beer, and Im not sure if I need the sour, but I may want it.

Can detect a good cherry aroma along with the fermantion aroma i get from almost all Belgium beers Ive had. Also what stood out for me was that cherry wood aroma and wet wooden barrel aroma. Dark red body with small pink head that disipated quick. Flavor had a sharp tart bite at first. As beer warmed up tartness mellowed out and more of the cherry flavor was apparent.

Definitely on the dark and earthy side.  I know its from the oak, but I just dont smell that in particular.  It definitely stands out in the flavor though.  Big hit of dry, rich cherries rounded off with oak notes.  The sourness is much less pronounced when compared to other Krieks (though to be fair, I have not had 3 Fonteinens Kriek).  There may not be a huge variety in flavor, but the flavor that is there is outstanding.  A top tier in my collection for sure.

Amazing cherry dimensions that bring images of an oak barrel filled to the brim with fresh cherries before the tasty sour nectar is added.  Light bodied, crisp, sour mouthfeel thats satisfyingly tart without being overdone.  The cherry flavors are simply fantastic.  Out from the sour woody flavor base erupt gobs of dark cherry fruits.  The fruity qualities are so real and so complex, I can taste the flesh, skins, and pits quite clearly.

The aroma was chock full of wild, half-dried cherries, dusty barnyard funk, and well-rounded oak accents.  The flavor shined with un-sweetened cherry tartness, funky must, and bunches of oak.  Tart on the palate, but not overbearing... sour cherry highlights... dry refreshing finish.  This was a most excellent brew!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

1125,"2006-06-28",4.7,"750 mL bottle, snifter, bottle 03/2005.  A thin, foamy pink head is quick to disperse over a deep and rich burgundy, sanguine hued body.  The glass beams red like a cherry Jolly Rancher when held to the lightcaptivating (the beer, not cherry Jolly Ranchers).  Cherry aroma is not lacking as this beer is bursting dark cherry and cherry pit aromasvery sour, very tannic.  Farmyard and horse blanket aromas bustle about but fall squarely in line with the other elements, never dominating.  Distinct lactic sourness simply adds to the sour and funky party already underway.  Warm and bready, even crusty, malt elements really work well here much in the same way Im so fond of New Glarus Belgian Red (cherry pie).  Acetic acid also appears to be present, but not enough to make the beer seem pickled.  The oak barrels have imparted a very mellow and warming presence to the aroma.  The flavor begins sweet and full, making no mistake that the cherries are the star in this beer.  Sour (almost licorice) and tannic qualities crush the sweetness down some making this infinitely drinkable.  The acidity level is mind-blowing perfecteverything is.  Bready malts arrive late and wash into wonderfully long, dry and tart finish.  This is reminiscent of a really well made Zinfandelthe actual sweetness is fairly low and the finish dry, but the juicy and fruity flavors keep fooling you into believing that its very sweet and rich.  While this beer isnt nearly as sour as the Cantillons or Oud Beersels and not nearly as funky as Hanssens it does something none of those beers manage.  It somehow manages to transport the flavor of these fresh picked cherries straight to the glass without disturbing them in the slightest.  Mouthfeel, I almost forgot!  Very rich and almost syrupy up front, it seems to quickly thin out into a velvetyalmost oilytexture as it dries out in the finish.  Carbonation seems a bit on the low side, but allows the flavors to be delivered with less interferenceIll live.  I can only begin to imagine how impressive this would be with a rich dark chocolate cake filled with real cherries and coated in a semi-bitter chocolate sauce.  ...Drie Fonteinen Schaerbeekse Kriek?  ...I like you.  *blushes*","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

1125,"2006-06-22",4.5,"What I dont understand is that in only a few ratings the age of the Schaerbeekse kriek is mentioned.
My rating is about the 2003 one.
When it was still young (in 2003) it was typical geuze, with the taste and smell of soil and barn. Deep inside you could taste and smell the the dry and sour cherrymeat combined with the wood of the stone of the cherry.
during 2004 and 2005  the smell and taste of the cherry was evolving into more smooth and more or less overruling the smell and taste of the soil and barn.
And now in 2006 it has become a real smooth beer wich even geuze haters will finish a glass from. It has not lost its typical barn and soil smell, nor its acidic taste and cherry stone components, but the smell and tast of the poor cherrys have changed into a smooth wrapping of the typical geuze components.
I still have a dozen of the 2003 to age or to trade, and a lot of the 2004 that will have to wait for a rating until next year.","Oegstgeest, NETHERLANDS","Immerseel"

The acidity level is high enough to create a pleasant tartness but not so high that we make funny faces.  A very good beer from a style Im not very found of.

750ml bottle, vintage unknown
Consumed at the Weekend of Spontaneous Fermentation, Opstal, May 2006 Very cloudy dark red and purple hue, with a light pink and purple head.  Sweaty nose, perfumy and sweaty (like BO), with a strange raw grain and spoiled cherry aroma.  First taste is raw, then a bit sour and caustic, but it mellows quickly into a more creamy, pasty perfumed cream, rose and cherry flavor.  Finishes better than it begins.


Resampled twice in 2007 from 750ml bottles.  Much more what I was expected, much more rich fruit and cherries, lightly sweet, but still a little weird.  Better this time, though.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

750ml 2005 bottling. 
Pours with a brilliant ruby body and a tall finely laced rose colored head. The aroma is absolutely divine! GOD I think I have just died because my soul is fluttering! This is bliss on earth as far as beer goes! A bold sourdough malty like undertone a tannic, very mildly lactic finish. It is cherries and oak, and vanilla, and fresh yogurt, melded with a musty cask and old damp farmhouse cellar. Wet grains, a fresh bundle of wheat wrapped burlap, horse blanket, worn leather all seem to be blended with the most marvelous sweet & sour cherries you have ever tasted!

A totally deep shade of raspberry red, with a pink head that my girfriend adored, but that was about it, she being of the Lindemans sweet lambic type...
Aromas are both funky and sweet, plenty of yeasty spices and tobacco/leather. 
The cherries came out as real and as potent as Ive ever tasted in a lambic, it was like eating fresh ripe cherries.  It was relatively sweet, so the acidity seemed a bit more shadowed but still plenty puckering.  The funk factor was also a bit toned down in the taste, in fact Im really surprised that Mélanie didnt like this more than her usual half-sip and puckered face.

Not quie as sour as Cantillon but I picked up more fruit depth here than I typically do in a Kriek.  Excellent.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
1125,"2005-12-20",4.3,"RLB YEHA 05.  Side by side with the oude kriek.  This one is a very cloudy deep pink/red with almost no head and it just looks a lot thicker than the oude kriek.  Lots of cherry in the aroma, sweetness, and a bit of the lacto funk and sourness but not nearly as much as the oude.  Flavor is also much sweeter, with fresher cherry taste, fuller body, and a slightly tart finish but not nearly as sour as I had thought it was going to be.  I like that it has a crapload of fruit flavor similar to the Lou Pepes but perhaps even more cherry!  This is one of my favorite Krieks.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

1125,"2005-12-19",4.4,"Hazy rosy-ruby in color with some unpredictable black particles resting near the bottom.  Dusty slash marks cross the surface suffice for the head.  Breathe the blissful memoir, my friend.  Cherries are a given, imparting a sour and tart dimension like no other as it channels through the olfactory.  At times, it courses through tart, acidic cranberry laterals and pipes green grape skin basking in lemon and lime juice.  Aroma is prominently parallel to what the taste buds discover.  Carbonation is toned down, making way for the tart cherry stream.  A glimpse of vanilla and amaretto nougats is quickly interrupted, returning us to the tart vessel of cherries.  Someone nearly took a vice grip to a plot of red raspberries and extracted the juice, aiding the sour, fruity acids that is never breeched by flagrant sugar implications.  Seemingly dries out and sweeps across the palate, leaving a forlorning and misleading sugar sweetness sense that, in the finish, masks the true sour glory that the kriek played on my palate.

Thanks so much for the bottle Jacob, this kicked ass!Pours the most lovely of cherry reds, with some strawberry-yellowish notes on the edges.  Resembles a ripening sour cherry quite nicely, with the yellow to orange to red colors.  Mountains of head rise up and is well-retained.  Foamy and pinkish-white, with plenty of lacing as it recedes.  Needless to say, it is unfiltered.  The aroma promises good things to come, with a delicious light acid and tart cherry juice combination, backed by hints of dry vanilla and cask wood.  The cherries are rich, yet dry and tart.  And then the flavor. . .Oh good lord, this is something else!!  As much as I appreciate and love Cantillon kriek, I think this one just took over my number one spot for favorite fruit lambic.  An easy 10 for flavor, for me, as it is just perfectly balanced between pure, fresh, real tart cherries, dry and puckering, and a wonderful light malt that adds the perfect amount of balance, in sort of a honey and vanilla creme sort of way.  The tartness is strong, but not quite as puckering as an old Cantillon kriek.  Granted, these are very different beers, so its not really right to compare them.  But wow, such fresh, boisterous cherry flavors with light funky-cheesy barnyard flavors.  I really like the use of these young, sour cherries versus a more black/sweeter cherry.  Such an exquisite balance between sweet and tart, sour and drinkable.  If I had access to more of these bottles, I fear I wouldnt be drinking much else as a session beer.This is one lambic Im glad I have drank young, I couldnt bare to see any of this magnificent cherry flavor recede with age.  Wow, cheers to Mr. Debelder.  If the 3F Framboos is better than this then god help me when I try that one.  So this is why Joris likes 3F so much. . . .2003 bottle at GABF party.  A darker, more tannic and almost sweeter smelling beer.  Funkier and with more cherry pulp smell and less bright, tart cherry juice.  The flavor was significantly less bright and tart than the 2004 bottle.  I mistook it for just the plain kriek version.  Still a wonderful beer, and I dont imagine there to be any significant difference in quality, I just think this beer is best drunk as young as possible to capture the boisterous, tart, fresh cherry acids.2005 bottle  The odd things about this one is that it, when fresh was EXTREMELY tart, pungent, sour, acidic.  I daresay, almost too much so?  Just a bit overdone, I guess and without the dainty, delicate brightness of the 2004 batch.  So, hoping that it would meld in to what the 2004 became after a year (near-perfect), I tried it again on 8/27/06 thanks to Tiggmtl.  Wow.  Almost slightly chalky, very weak sourness.  The fruit has really gone South.  Seems like a lot of the wheat smoothness shows through.  No real flaws, just WAY too reserved.  Just sort of there, unfortunately.  Hopefully that was just an off bottle.  Will try it again soon, no doubt.  8/5/7/4/15","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1125,"2004-08-10",2.8,"Bottle. Thanks Duff. Aroma is mildly interesting - there is vanilla, paint, plastic & wood, but I'm not getting anything outstandingly special. With some lambics, and especially some funky dry ciders, the aroma keeps dragging me back because of shifting notes of interest, or a compelling whiff of barnyard. But I'm not getting that here. The aroma is surprisingly flat and dull. The appearance is of murky rhubarb. I think there is a very fine line between a murky red being stunningly attractive or stunningly revolting; but this achieved the distinction of simply being dull. Mouthfeel is very dry. Flavours are woody, raspberry, tannic, cherry - but very dry, thin, unripe cherry - not a luscious, juicy morello cherry. The whole thing quite pleasantly musty, but very painful to drink. I struggled with this. I found the mouthfeel too dry, slightly acidic, and not at all rewarding or inviting. The difference between an ordinary beer and a great beer can sometimes be in the subtle detail. Here it centres on the nature of an individual's reaction to the special cherries used. I'm not keen on the slightly unripe flavour of these cherries - prefering something with a little more sweetness.  This is not a bad beer at all - just something not to my taste.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

1125,"2004-06-09",4.8,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2004 This is maybe the most beautiful beer of the more than 700 I have seen so far!!! Pours a tall frothy deep pink head on a hazy deep red body - WOW! Aroma is extremely delicious, sweetnsour fruity and flowery with tones of almonds and plenty of sweet cherries. Very full and heavy, you can really smell the high quality. Flavor is acidid and well balanced. Wood and cherry notes and also some almond here! Very complex and not too sour. Nice dry woody finish.

This is definately one of the best beers I have ever had and again I must say a huge thanks to Jacob Lövenlund for bringing this amazing beer home from Belgium!! Amazing stuff!!","Brooklyn, Alabama, USA","Jeppe"

1125,"2004-05-24",3.9,"Dark red with a pink head - very pretty.  Aroma of leather and cherries. Respectable amount of funk, but not assertively so.  Ditto the acidity, which is ably balanced with sweet cherry notes and a dryish, nutty character.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

1125,"2004-05-23",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2010  Bottle brought back by MartinT to whom it was given by incredibly generous JorisPPattyn. Cheers to both. Enjoyed also with Oakes, Kimchee and tiggmtl  Appearance is a beautiful bloody red with a thin diminishing pink head. The red is so brilliant that it scores a 5 anyway. Aroma is complex of lambic funk. Spicier than most with cinnamon, cloves. The cherries are very nice, feeling unriped, both black and red cherries, intense and bold for a lambic. Earthy mold. Palate is very lactic with its typical yoghourt sourness, balsamic and citric, moderately salty. Funky brett with nutty, earthy branches and leafy undertones. It didnt strike me as spectacular from the first sip and sniff, but it grew on me and I realised I drank my glass very fast. I like its grapey vinous character and as weird as it sounds, to me, this is a quaffable offering despite its a real crime to just think about drinking this fast! This is a very complex kriek, with a good backing medium body and medium-high carbonation. Just what a brewery!  Lowering from 4.6 to 4.3. Outstanding lambic, but not an absolute favourite.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

1125,"2003-11-19",4.8,"Bottled at SBF 2003.
Dark pinot noir red colour. Hazy.
Spicy aroma with acidic  spicy cherry tones.
Acicid flavor with spices, cinnamon and olives. Acicid finish.
This is a top ten beer.   
The balance between the  spicy wild grown Scharbeek cherries and the acidic lambic of Armand Denbelder is prefect. This is as close  to a fine pinot noir you get by using cherries and beer. You would think that the difference between the regularly used Slovenian sour cherries and the original Scharbeek ones shouldn´t be that big, but it´s huge. Armand for this  got hold of 900 kg of cherries. This one is rare. If you see it, buy it.","Solna Stockholm, SWEDEN","DrBeer"
1125,"2003-11-10",4.8,"Ultra-superb indescribable deep red colour; good dense pink head. There is also an ultra-flunky deposit at the end. Concentrated cherry aroma, full as nothing else but the bursting of a fresh, ripe sour cherry in one's teeth. Superb-tart taste, concentrated full-cherry flavour, neither sweet, neither outspoken acidity. There is a lambic underbuild, but is definitely subjugated to the all-conquering fruit flavours. All the above doesn't prevent it from a quite vicious acid-burn. Full fruity mouthfeel. Armand wanted this to be a flash from the past - and that's what it is. Now that real Schaarbeekse (in fact, virtually wild) krieken are getting rare and not commercially available anymore, he proved that if one really wants, one can make true tradition alive once more.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
1125,"2003-10-09",3.4,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2004 [Bottled at Stockholm Beer Festival] A beutiful red beer with a fast disappearing pink head. The aroma is sweet with strong cherry notes. The flavor is sour with light cherry notes - a nice flavor but not fantastic. A good kriek - but I've had them better.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
1125,"2003-09-01",4.7,"Bottle. GBBF2003 (kriek tasting session). Deep red colour, slight haze, initially good cherry red head and moderate condition. Big thick aromas of cherry and almond mingled with lambic notes. Quite dry in the mouth but full bodied and cherry heavy in the mouth with a slight apple tart lambic edge. Long dry and nutty almond finish.
Excellent.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"
1125,"2003-08-12",4.2,"GBBF 2003 - tutored tasting with Lorenzo Dabove: First smell is like an pine tree forest, kind of rhasberry syrup, of course cherry, some marcipan tones and citrus. Soft carbontation in this wonderful deep dark purple pink liquid. Smooth not sharp but dense bitterness, scratches the back of the throat - great - Iwantalambic :-)","New Jersey, USA","YogiBeera"
1125,"2003-06-09",4.6,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2003 Bottled. The bottle is unlabelled, according to Akkurat this is because it is still noy officially sold. It pours dark clear red with almost no carbonation, probably because it is still really young. Acidic aroma of fresh black cherries. Very vinous, even more so thanks to the low carbonation. Firm and clean. The finish is full of citric acid and a light touch of fruity bitterness.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
