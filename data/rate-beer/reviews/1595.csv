1595,"2014-12-08",2.5,"This Sake is better warm than chilled, although the instructions state otherwise. Welcoming aroma. Lightly sweet and one-dimensional. Creamy and turns sharp. A bit pricey for the quality, but certainly drinkable.","","AlanSquier"
1595,"2014-03-08",3.1,"Bottle to celebrate turning clocks ahead. I love cloudy unfiltered sake but this has an odd pour with almost greenish hue. Nose is melon and rice. Tastes of unripe honeydew, rice, cocunut, pepper, chalk and a touch antiseptic. Creamy mouthfeel with alcohol","New York, USA","Jow"
1595,"2012-11-01",3.4,"300 ml bottle from the supermarket. Pours cloudy white, though not as thick and pasty as their regular junmai. Aroma is rather plain, rice, koji, light caramel and fruit. Somewhat spicy/peppery as well. Slightly pasty body and flavor, koji, rice, with condensed milk and vanilla, caramel notes. Starts hot, gets a bit sweet, then dries out. Quite peppery, dry finish, with some remaining alcohol. Pretty nice, though a bit bland. Not sickly sweet like the junmai, and not too pasty either. Good.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
1595,"2010-11-07",2.6,"Its funny that the bottle states that this is a lightly cloudy sake because this is pretty much as cloudy as they come.  Pours a very white cloudy color.  Aroma is of rice, yeast, alcohol, lactate, and some fruitiness.  Flavor is both bitter and sweet, kind of like a white Russian with expired milk.  Not sure if I like this one.  I had it a couple of weeks back, but I was so wasted that I thought it was sweet.  So after trying it now in a sober state, I have to admit that I was completely wrong!","Fall River, Massachusetts, USA","halfonit"
1595,"2010-07-04",3.7,"This bottled sake in a pretty blue green bottle with a silver top wrap from a bottle shop poured a very small head of clear colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a uncarbonated milky thin white colored body with a lot of fine powdery particulate. The mild aroma was  sweet rice and lactate. The vinous mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish with a strong vinous alcohol burn in the aftertaste. The smooth milky flavor contained notes of vinous polished rice. A wonderful best in class brew.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

1595,"2008-05-18",1.9,"Not recommended. Flavor is really not there. Dry alcohol and chalk is a best way to describe this one.","California, USA","bill1958"
1595,"2007-09-10",2.2,"Served shaken and chilled.  Cloudy greyish white color with tiny visible flakes of rice.  Somewhat watery appearance.  Mild light fruits, faint coconut, and alcohol on the nose.  Decent aroma gives way to a completely lackluster flavor profile.  Tastes dry and soapy, like dirty dishwater.  A little fruit and cream are present, but they are overshadowed by the unpleasant, chalky overtones.  Bone-dry alcohol finish inconsistent with many Nigoris Ive sampled.  This is not a good sake, by any means.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1595,"2007-06-20",2.0,"The aroma is strong with rice, alcohol, and bamboo. The appearance is a nice cloudy white. The flavor is strong like the aroma and has all the same elements plus coconut. The palate is thin and oily with a dry finish. The sake is OK but not great and way to expensive.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
1595,"2007-06-20",2.9,"ve had a few Nigori sake in the past and this is the first one I had that was dry like a Junmai .  There is a minor sweetness but that is only in the background. If you are willing to try it then take a chance.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
1595,"2007-06-07",1.9,"White, opaque milky looking appearance.  Fruity aroma, melon, banana, and a fairly strong shot of peppery alcohol.  Flavour is very flat and alcoholic with a markedly vegetal component.  Thin palate.  Lingering cooling mintiness on the back.  Meh, its a bit like alcoholic milk.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1595,"2006-11-08",2.4,"Bought this in the beautiful village of Shirakawa. A World Heritage site famous for the thatched roof houses of the town. Typical Nigori, looks like a glass of whole fresh milk,  off-white and creamy. Very mild scent, creamy with a spicy.nutmeg & koji aroma. Almost like a Holiday brew. Thick, chewy, raw and rough. Homemade eggnog with no sugar and cheap rum. Leaves a chalky feel. Nigoris are hit and miss, for me, mostly miss.
If I could filter this a few times and age it in French Oak for a year or so, it might be great but as it stands now, Id have to pass.","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"
1595,"2006-04-22",1.9,"Very dissappointing, milky color no disticnt aroma. tasted like skim milk + alcohol.","New York, USA","crazyvin"
1595,"2005-12-01",2.2,"Hazy clear color,no real aroma that i can pick out but you can definatley tell the alcohol presence.The flavor is nothing special with maybe a bit of a fruit presence but hard to say and the alcohol is kind of in your face throughout the sampling.Definately one of the lesser desireables in the style.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
1595,"2003-12-06",1.6,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2004 Major alcohol bite is present, yet the sweetness and traditional Nigori creaminess moderates things somewhat.  Opaque like a watered-down glass of skim milk.  I'd say that for its price, you get what you pay for, due to the harshness of the alcohol burn.  Other flavors present seem one-dimensional, like the milkiness (which is evident in the aroma, too).  A bland, disappointing product, that is so far the worst Japanese Nigori I've tried.  Avoid, despite the cool blue bottle.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
