197,"2016-12-10",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 25, 2017 On tap @below zero temperatures at the Ljetno Kino Tukanac release event. A damn shame for the first commercial Croatian wood aged beer! Almost black body with a brownish head. Light soft aroma, vanilla, malty, vague chocolate. The taste goes the same way, soft, slightly subdued, vanilla, cocoa and maltiness. Over time, tried later on, proved to be an excellent beer that grew taste-wise as time went on.","Split / Zagreb, CROATIA","Marko"
