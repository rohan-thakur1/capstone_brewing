3288,"2013-11-07",4.8,"Draught at zoiglstube in May. 2013: Hazy pumpkin orange. Creamy meringue adorns the glass with clingy lace. Dizzyingly complex nose of shortbread, marzipan, lemon sherbet, fresh crushed black peppercorns, orange oil, tobacco, milk chocolate and a hint of manure. Soft, tiny-bubbled carbonation. Fiercely spicy with peppercorn-like hop grip, upfront. Body is laced with sharp minerals along with captivatingly succulent and slippery peach marmalade hop flavors. Spalt is oily as all get out. Deeply nourishing beadcrust-laden melanoidins massage the tongue before dovetailing with vivid notes of fresh baked gingerbread and cookie accents which exert a gentle bite and beautifully contrast with the resounding softness. Finishes dry and immaculately attenuated, yet satiating and potently peppery with oodles of black licorice and pillowy manure-tinged smoke and a host of other idiosyncrasies which defy description. At some point you just have to put the pen down and immerse yourself in the present moment to fully assimilate a breathtaking experience that is unequivocally peerless. Andreas brewing mastery is uncanny and utterly mystifying. He somehow manages to coax every trace of elegant nuance from each ingredient and turn in into something totally groundbreaking and uniquely divine. All one has to do is taste these beers in order to realize there most likely is not another brewer alive with this level of brewing aptitude. Unreal.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

3288,"2012-01-08",3.4,"50 cl draft @ Moeder Lambic, Fontainas.
Dorée blanche.
Arôme de malt fumé léger avec un houblon agréablement herbacé donnant des notes de citron, grains et malt type pils/cara.
En bouche, bière dans le style allemand, bien fraîche, palais est sec et ce profile grattant sur la langue comme une poire. Le tout est agrémenter dun profile malt fumé que je trouve être trop discret. Cela se complète sur un houblon fruité/citronné laissant une belle amertume sur le fini.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
3288,"2011-12-04",5.0,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2013 Pulled from the tanks at 4 weeks at Ganstaller-Brau.  The image of Andreas hunched over and pulling from the bottom of the tank as smoked zoigl spits out everywhere is one I will cherish and enjoy laughing about forever. The body is moderately hazy, approaching cloudy, with a tall, lasting fine-bubbled white head.  It was being lagered at around 40F so after letting it warm a bit it turns into a magical aromatic blossom of dried cut grass / hay / floral hops, honey-drizzled biscuit pilsner malt and floral / wheat / dandelion yeast esters with a incredibly delicate and appropriately restrained smoke character (which comes across as some sort of smoked or just-charred / singed / toasted grain husks or wheat, with just a touch of pig flesh) that integrates with the aforementioned hop, pale malt and yeast aromas.  Its fucking devine.  The grain bill is only something like 10-15% smoked malt (or less, I cant remember), so resulting smoke character is smartly held back in this way to allow the synergistic result of mild smoke, delicate noble hops, perfectly-attenuated pilsner malt biscuity-ness (yes thats a word) and quiet, floral yeast to play a fucking orchestra to your senses.  Astonishingly balanced dryness for the body, but still hints at honey sweetness throughout. Superbly light, pillowly, creamy and silky carbonation (natural, from the tank!), the result is a sort-of merging of traditional Bavarian styles, Zoigl and Rauch, but with the touch and care of perhaps the best brewer in Germany.  Unreal.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
