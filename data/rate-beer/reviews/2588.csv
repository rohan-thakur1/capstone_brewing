2588,"2015-04-14",3.5,"East end brought out a 2010 keg and had it on. Pale yellow pour. Slightly cloudy. White head. Aromas of bread and pineapple sourness. Taste is tart sourness. Pretty decent stuff.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Art"
2588,"2012-01-21",3.8,"Kvass #8: A: Light orangish-yellow body... thick white cap... moderate lacing..

S: Tart sourdough bread dominates... light citrus notes.. mostly lemon and orange...

T: Delicious... bready malts... sourdough loaf after sourdough loag after sourdough loaf... nice tart character... light citrus.. some bitterness

M: Chewy, but light-medium body... lingering aftertaste

O: Top notch kvass... I think i liked the dark kvass from EEBC slightly better... a little more subdued and slightly more complex.. but this is a very good representation of the kvass and I cant think of anyone that does it better than EEBC","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
2588,"2011-01-30",3.4,"Pours hazy amber with a slight fizzy head.  Aroma is spicy and very saison-like.  A slight metallic hint, too.  Flavor is unexpected.  Sorty of salty and grainy.  Some nice fruity esters and maybe even some licorice.  The body is light and refreshing.  Im glad I tried it, but it wasnt something I would enjoy all the time.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Naka"
2588,"2011-01-25",4.1,"Poured into my ""WE BE JAZZIN"" pint glass from New Orleans. In case you were wondering, I be jazzin as well. This is my first encounter with the style.

4.0 A: Murky yellowish brown. One finger of frothy white head that dies down rather quickly and leaves no lacing.

4.5 S: Not surprisingly, this is bready, with plenty of rye earthy spiciness coming through. The bread yeast contribution is interesting for sure and comes off as a doughy funkiness. In a lot of ways, this smells like what it is: a beer made from bread.

4.5 T: Dominant flavor is rye bread, which again isnt surprising. Good balance of bitterness and breadiness stemming from earthy rye. A touch of sourness on the front end, with a ""dirty"" doughiness on the back.

4.0 M: Medium body and slightly chewy. Super smooth throughout. This could use a bit more carbonation, but for all I know it could be perfectly to style. Still, if I made it, Id give it another 0.5 ppm.

5.0 D: I had a hard time figuring out the scores for this brew. I like it quite a bit, but I have absolutely nothing to compare it too. Based on the other kvasses found on this site and the reviews Ive read, Id have to venture that this one is tops for the style. In any case, I might go through this whole growler in one sitting, thats how smooth and drinkable this is.

2588,"2010-08-15",3.5,"Thanks to MrChopin for the trade for this one.  Wow, this is goddamned wierd.  I was expected a dark malty bready Kvass, like so many that are imported from Russia today.  This guy was in a clear growler, the color of a giant  melted creamsicle.  The aroma is also completely unexpected.  Its a lot like a Berliner Weiss, sour, wheat, cereal grains, light fruit, lemon.  The flavor is more or less the same, sour, wheat, more lemon.  The finish is sour, tart lemon, almost no hop bittering, or actually, very little of any kind of bittering.  The body is on the thick side of medium.  Wierd, but very interesting.  Im a big fan of traditional beers, and I am very glad I got to try this.  Thanks, Kevin.  Now, I begin my quest to  find the Dark Kvass, or Loaf.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"
2588,"2010-08-07",3.3,"Looks like yellow custard and is one of the most unappealing beers Ive gazed at, also a thin white ring. Thankfully things improve... nose of pepper and lemon, lightly funky grass, then toast and smoke. Flavor is more lemon and dark bread, metal and a bit of coriander. Sticky, lightly bitter finish, grainy flavor lingers with a touch of lemon. Insanely drinkable and flavorful, but not cohesive start-to-finish.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

S- Light bready aroma. Herbal hints can be noted too.

T- Rye bread taste up front. Bready and a bit tart with herbal flavors added. Slight bitter aftertaste. Some yeast lingers.

P- Medium carbonation and light body. Very well done.

O- This is quite drinkable. Its a great session beer for any time of the year.

Its great to have Kvass available here in Pittsburgh. I hope the style catches on in the US.

Full yeast in the nose, lactic notes (moderate) and banana, yogurt and dough rounds out the aroma.  Lightly tart up front, then more lactic sourness over the middle.  Lacks carbonation but that is supposedly to-style (who knows?).  Slick on the tongue, with some semi-tart lemon and banana flavor, bready and doughy all around.  Strange dryness in the finish, parched almost, but throughout the drink it’s consumed in a breadiness, which makes sense since they actually stuffed bread into this thing (ok, actually they fermented the bread, but it looks like someone stuffed a loaf of bread into my glass, it’s so murky).","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Scott the owner of east end, is simply just great, he was pouring!. This one glass had to be the beer tasting experience of the year for me. Scott said this keg, that he just tapped, was just finished brewing today. I dont know what that means in brewery talk but I think it meant it was really fresh! This stuff poured like a quality wheat brew, hazy, cloudy and slightly vanilla orange in color. Off white head that fades rapidly. The aroma is something to behold, the smell of cooked homemade bread prevails. This is not like yeasty uncooked rising bread dough that is so common with other brews, this had the aroma of baked bread. The taste is like a wheat beer but more intense, more quality is present to the taste buds. Flavors of bready and earthly tones along with some barnyard flavors that must be experienced to be believed. Hints of freshly cut hay. Absolutely no hint of alcohol what so ever. The Perfect session brew. Has a decent medium carbonation on the palate. Finish is nice with gentleman manners that can only be matched with good wheat brews. This beer is a must taste for beer aficionados. Overall, a great beer tasting experience, will not hesitate to do this one again.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

2588,"2006-12-08",4.3,"Much thanks to jasonm for the trade...
Appears a hazy, murky, non-transparent light gold with an orange hue and a small white head that fades into a film and collar. Spotty lacing is left all around the glass.
Smell is yeasty, doughy, creamy, sugary, with mild citrus and hints of caramel. The brew ultimately shines through with a freshly milled grain aroma that is addictive to smell. Very unique...its like a honey infused cracked wheat and barley aroma.
The taste? Man, this is good stuff. Creamy goodness of the doughy, sugary bread and grain feeds the tastebuds need to be glorified. These flavors stimulate the hypothalamus into believing its a candy in a glass...""liquid bread"", indeed.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, light amount of sugar touching the front of the tongue and running along the sides into a yeasty, semi-dry finish.
Bravo to Scott and Tom for having the courage to actually brew this style in the U.S. I really enjoyed it and feel that it has been very under-rated checking out some of the other reviews.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"

I asked the bar keeper (actually just a helper at a refrigerated keg... not Scott, the brewer) how this beer had the sweet touch and he told me, ""we did put a little malt in this...""  Really interesting and, although its alcohol content is a little higher than the stuff still made in Eastern Europe, it was really cool to be able to try a Kvass.... Thanks Scott!","Sligo","pjk33"

Hints of the brown malt are present in the mouth and give way to a lightly acidic flavor of lemon and limes.  Cheers to Scott for being adventurous.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","lukin013"
2588,"2006-10-22",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 29, 2007 From growler, and also at the brewery. Has a mild rye bread aroma, not malty but like opening a bread box and getting a whiff of fresh cut bread and crust. Murky muddy dark amber with an off-white head. Light watery body with medium carbonation and some tangy fizziness. Taste is very subtle. Mild bready taste and rye maltiness. Carbonic tang with some sour dough notes. A nice bit of bitterness, with hints of lemon juice and apple skins. Mild quaff and great for a session or two.
Second batch: much more maltiness to it and less tangy. This batch (aka Kvass-100) with more bread than the original, is just superb as a session beer. Dont know if this could be a regular, but I hope it will at least appear from time to time. Excellent ale!","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"
