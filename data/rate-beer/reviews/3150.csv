3150,"2017-05-15",4.3,"Pours a moderately hazy golden with a white head that settles in a white rim but is still easy to revive and leave good lacing. Nose is of flowers, grass (or maybe just really, really hoppy), oak, wine and bandaid. Taste is lightly tart, winey and loaded with more hops that feel more fruity/lemony than to grassy this time. Lots of flavors and all nice ones as well! Body is medium, carbonation moderate and texture is juicy x vinous. Awesome beer, really! I need to track some to myself or maybe hope that b2 is just as good?","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

3150,"2017-05-09",4.4,"750mL bottled Jan 12, 2017, shared 4/13/17 with Nelson.Hazy golden-copper. Sizable off-white head with good retention.Nose is lactic with good green, dank, juicy hops still apparent. Pineapple-tinted, but no overt Galaxy spiciness or heavy mango/lime juiciness that you get when fresh. Very clean with polished acids being nicely integrated with hop and malt. Biscuit, vanilla and light honey all balance the hop and bacterial acid and theres no sign of wood or liquor in the nose.Maltier, yet nicely dry, with soft honey and much less tartness than expected given the lactic character the nose exhibits. Hoppy, as well, adding pineapple and spicy, dank, green hop notes that dont have a distinct identity any longer but are still expressed well and impart a balancing flavor to the malt. Near no bitterness, though thankfully none is needed, given the dryness. Very lovely texture is nearly chewy from the barrel tannin and malt but the carbonation is perfectly tight and keeps the beer bright and bubbly. Absolutely jam-packed with flavor, especially given the relatively lower abv. No resin, and not boozy or too tart/lactic. Really nice and wish Id bought a lot more of them.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3150,"2017-04-29",4.6,"This shit is delicious! Wish I grabbed a few of these, pours a hazy yellow golden with a finger of white foam. Layers and layers of stonefruit, citrus and tropical goodness with just the right balance of smooth soft vanilla soaked oak, tart funky brett and a soft lingering bitterness that works perfectly with the juicy sweet fruit hop profile. Damn ! Nectarine, mango, pineapple just a amazing beer with a perfect amount of body and mouthfeel, straight nectar !","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"

3150,"2017-04-12",4.7,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2017 On tap at Omnipollos Hatt. Pours cloudy apricot with a medium frothy white head. Aromas of funk, farmhouse, kiwi, orange, earthy notes, light oak notes. Insane aroma. Could smell this forever. Taste is just freaking awesome! Fruity with farmhouse and earthy, garden notes that seamlessly blends together. Light wood / oak notes on the mouth as well but exquisitely blended to be a very stunning addition and not a nuisance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly dry with moderate carbonation that perfectly sustains the taste. Just wow wow wow wow wow.","Stockholm, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","ansalon"
3150,"2017-04-11",4.5,"Dégustée en compagnie de Marc-André. Cheers mec! Cette bière fut un solide coup de coeur et le clou de la soirée. La robe est parfaite et illumine la pièce par sa flamboyance, sa tête crémeuse, son voile de mariée. Parfaitement lisse, une fine pellicule laiteuse tapisse mon verre lorsque le liquide y tournoie. Janticipe une texture sublime en bouche. Une explosion de mandarine et de clémentine du Maroc envahit mon larynx. Les flaveurs fruitées où lagrume est roi se marient à merveille avec ces barils parfaitement boisés. Je suspecte un baril de Sherry mais incapable de me prononcer sur lautre. Aucune acidité issue du bois, une touche de vanille qui me fait saliver... que cest bon! Une pointe damertume en finale et une buvabilité hors du commun. Une IPA de ce calibre, vieillie dans 2 barils et vendue au retail où dautres éditions spéciales sont vendues presque au triple du prix? Cest du délire de ne pas en acheter à la caisse.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
