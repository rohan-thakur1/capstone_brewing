The best dubbel I have had but I am far from a fan of the style and I would choose to have this slightly chilled to suppress the (not excessive at all for the style) yeasty notes which admittedly defeats the object of a dubbel.

If smells were colors, this would be purple - -a deep, sweet smell almost like grape juice thats been left in the sun. The liquid glugs out a deep orangey brown with a giant pale bubbly head. Champagne bubbles surge up from the depths. This is a good-looking beer. The flavor starts with sweet grape/raisin flavor, while prunes and other dark fruits are also apparent. Theres a slight alcohol warmth, while a light bitterness hits in the aftertaste and a sour tanginess lingers on the sides of the tongue -- my favorite part of this beer, along with the very creamy mouthfeel.

561,"2015-02-06",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 23, 2017 25.4 oz, corked and caged, smudged dating but it looks something like BOTTLED 3/19/13. Nose is wonderfully fruity, dates, figs, and raisins coming through perfectly clearly, strong sherry and pleasant oxidation, strong maltiness, some brown sugar and toffee, tawny port character with some time. Stone fruit all the way, including peaches, and some light cherry. Pours dark garnet with a foamy beige head. Taste semi-sweet, plenty of heavy alcohol but its relatively gentle and hidden, dries to toastier and bread crustier tones as the chest slowly begins to warm, lots of raisins and cherry, candied fruit character. That Munich-y character is sublime and not overplayed.  Light bitterness but this is still decidedly malt-forward, a smooth but still-crisp full body, but not fat. Mineral character is extremely light, yeast is clean and not airy, which I often find detrimental in this style. Candied character is complementary and does not cloy; it bears repeating, theres initial sweetness but it dries out extremely quickly. Overall mature, balanced, and deeply satisfying.  Without going back and checking my notes, this is better than every Belgian-made Dubbel Ive had [edit: it is indeed the highest-rated of now 40 Dubbels] and ranks up there with the best of the American and Belgian Quads -- was it good fortune to wait on this bottle, or would I enjoy a fresh one more?

Aromat: słodki i dość alkoholowy. Karmel, czekolada, spieczone ciasto, cukier kandyzowany, owoce (figi, rodzynki). Początkowo całkiem przyjemny, ale po chwili dochodzą także aromaty miodowe i jakby lekko papierowe, co może sugerować utlenienie, ale być może się czepiam. 

Smak: pełny, słodowy, ale umiarkowanie słodki. Dość wysokie wysycenie powoduje lekkie szczypanie na języku. Nieco wytrawna kontra z wyczuwalną goryczką, zapewne jednak pochodzącą z alkoholu, który na końcu wyraźnie rozgrzewa.

Served in a 10 oz chalice glass

Appearance  Served a hazy ruby color with a smaller off-white head. The head faded at a moderate pace giving way to a medium level of lacing.

Smell  The nose was of grapes and a little bit of dark fruit. There was a light yeasty aroma mixed in as well.

Taste-The taste was largely of sweeter white grape up front. The lightness of the grape flavor darkened over time giving way to a more red grape and raisin flavor toward the middle and the end. At the very end of the taste there were hints of cherry that worked their way into the flavor and mixed with a alcohol-boozy taste that left its mark on the tongue, in a nice warming way.

Mouthfeel  The mouthfeel was medium with an average level of carbonation. Nothing to amazing.

All it takes is desire to seek out and find these things, these moments and everything in between. We brewed Lost and Found Abbey Ale to pay homage to the great monastic breweries of Belgium. Like us, we hope you’ll take the time to discover a beer that breathes aromas of figs, raisins and candied fruits. Please join us by raising your glass as we offer a toast to patience, perseverance, and all the things we have lost along the way and were somehow lucky enough to find once again.

561,"2013-09-24",3.7,"January 6th, 2012 - The Lost and Found combines two of my favorite beer characteristics: Lost Abbeys brewing style, and the Belgium Dubbel. The rewards are theoretical, and a quick sample of the beer reveals that they are also empirical. The nose overflows with dark cherries, rich and freshly shaved chocolate, and the arcane scents of Burley pipe tobacco. The flavor carries over from the nose, dripping with overripe cherries, roasted pecans and even a little bacon. All the tastes and flavors emanating from this brew are fascinating in combination, but the only thing that holds the Lost and Found back is that they are a little muddied - the flavors are never especially pronounced, and they never pop. Instead, they sort of swirl lazily and without direction. Overall, this is an excellent treat, but it s also in heated competition with American and Belgian counterparts. Even then, this beer is a testament to Lost Abbeys brewing skills.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation.

Awesome balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick, creamy, and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish.

Aroma: The aroma has raisin, plum, and other dark fruit, caramel, nuts, and toast

Appearance: It pours a dark and cloudy amber color with a small beige-brown head

Flavor: It is fairly sweet, the components from the nose come through, and it has a little spice

Palate: The body is fairly full, with a thick, almost heavy feel, a little stickiness, and some mild heat

Overall Impression: 
This is a very solid Belgian-style Abbey Dubbel.  It has a lot going on, but that makes sense in this style, and everything works well together.  My only qualm would be that it is just the tiniest hint too sweet, but overall, it is really good stuff.  As usual, Lost Abbey nails this Belgian style.

561,"2012-03-19",4.0,"0.75l corked bottle. After a hectic-as-hell day at work, I really think I deserve a little treat. Today my choice landed on this one from the magicians at Lost Abbey. It pours a blurry nutty brown body with a nice reddish hue and a massive and heavy lacing ashy head thats really hanging in there for quite a while. When it comes to the aroma on this one is quite delicious and complex. It has a nice cocoa and chocolate touch, some dark dried fruits, quite a good dash of warming alcohol but also hints of yeast, sweet caramel and licorice. Quite nice! A bit disappointing carbonation level on it, really soft - actually on the border of being flat and that did not really suit this dubbel. Taste however is as delicate as the aroma. Its nutty and chocolaty with tones of cocoa, dark malts, caramel and some dried fruits. Really smooth as always from Lost Abbey before it ends in a nice warming finish with a near spicy aftertaste.

Since the alcohol gradation is not so much noticeable, it results a drinkable beer, having both some of the trappists style and the typical Ale. Unfortunately the froth is not so much persistent, but this is absolutely a negative point as regard the whole opinion, which is totally positive.

Pour was a nice murky dark brown with reddish hues and a one finger light tan head. Taste was nice. Figs and raisin are the predominant flavor. As it warmed, nutmeg and brown sugar emerged. What I loved about this beer was the strong and aggressive carbonation. It bit the cheeks and mouth nicely. The candi sugar and Belgian yeast come up in the aftertaste.

Head retention and lacing are both decent enough.  The aroma is nice and malty, the brew smells like dark fruit (mostly raisins, along with some cherries and figs), nuts, brown sugar and toffee.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but theres a bit of spice noticeable too.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its creamy and has moderate carbonation.  Its also smooth and goes down easy.

561,"2011-11-10",4.1,"Appearance: garnet and ruby under a bready khaki head which fades blotchy and clumpy while sticking to the sides of my glass. Swirls creamy.

Nose: raisins, figs, and prunes  meaty and rich. Nutmeg, allspice, and raisins mingle in the back. Wisps of leather. Tartness of unripe plums, bitter tannins of plum skins. Bourbon barrels  wood and spice. Musky, bretty, leathery, and horsey weaves it all together.

Palate: chewy, rich, and warm in the back. Raisins, figs, and dates both fresh and dried. Leather weaves in and out. The richness continues without being heavy, sweet without being cloying. Raisins and prunes mingle with leather. Tartness lurks along the edges with wood, port, and plum skins. Wintery spices  cumin, ginger, nutmeg, allspice. Heat and spice grabs back of throat with each quaff  bourbon. Warm breath.

So you guys sized the wrong cork, cork supplier quality control issues or what? The liquid that finally made it out of the 750mL bottle is ruby red to amber in color and supporting a tan like head. The aroma has spicy yeast, lots of sweet raisins and then a wild yeast like tartness at the edges of the aromatic experience. The taste has bold raisin notes as well as mildly tart wild yeastiness, some yeast spices and brown sugar.

561,"2011-10-01",3.5,"Just finished watching the greatest Rugby game in history of the Cup - Tonga devistates France with unbending defence. I cannot believe what I just watched! Had this for at least a year? Reddish brown with a well defined compact light tan head on top of a reddish brown brew with a healthy dose of sediment. Dubbelish for sure. Caramel, spice, raisins, honey, grass, mild molasses, maybe a mulled orange or something, more of a thick raisin now, some soft fruits - this really improves a lot with time in the glass. When am I going to do a review and not be exhausted? Reviewing this is being done on the bottom half to bottom third of the bottle. Tasty stuff albeit not strong - plenty of subdued qualities. Spices and a weird dry something hit quick, a gingery spice maybe, nutmeg, I dunno. All I know is that in minutes I am going to drink a bunch of hot sauce and then Im going to cook up some Original Flavour Ichiban and then Im going to consider and explore one of lifes great mysteries - bees. Bees and why I cannot ride them. I just want to ride a bee god dammit.  I need a bee harness and I also want to wear a cowboy hat. I also want to sport the wonderful plastic glasses / nose combo. I think my eyes smell. Orangy tang at an underlying level, raisins, raisins, mild pepper, caramel, brown sugar, honey, anise, plastic shoe lace tips in a medeira reduction served by a duck - a proper one - one wearing a top hat. In nature, a top hat on a duck or a weasel signifies uppitiness in the animal kingdom. If its on a worm then the acid has kicked in in a timely manner. No sign of the oxidization that I wrongly assumed would be found with ease, I think people who collect stamps are fucking losers. Tim Hortons patrons - you are all pathetic sheep. Die, please in a manner than humours me. Fudge, belches, some darker fruit stuff. Medium bodied and a forgetful finish. I really hate Tim Hortons. Thanks for all the pollution in my neighbourhood, thanks for making idiots idle their cars for 15 minutes to get your pre-made subpar products. Nice baked donuts - die. It is a plague. Those heart tugging commercials - who the hell does that actually work for? Consistently the worst commercials on my tube TV. I enjoyed this beer I think even though I feel like I was let down.

The aroma isnt really all that strong but there still seems to be a lot going on with nice subtle nuances.  Raisins, dates, Belgian yeast, caramel, sugars, and a touch of vanilla.  The flavor is just rich enough to offer plenty of substance while still being quite drinkable for 8%.  Everything noted in the aroma seems to show in the taste as well.  It is fairly sweet from some rich malt, dark fruit, and candied fruity notes but it gets slightly dry in the finish with a little bit of spiciness.

Bottled on: 11/23/10 (I think thats right, I smudged the date while fighting with the cork).

Appearance: Pours a dark, ruddy-hued body with a tall, foaming head stand, light beige in color.

Smell: Some sweetish notes of dark brown sugar, dark syrup, and a bit of caramel (though upon warming, some cocoa-ish hints awaken). Fruity, slightly boozy, though not caustic hints wrapped up in a spicy herbaceousness like a squirt of Angostura bitters.

Taste: Dark brown sugar-topped toast, with a yeasty, doughy tone about it. Robustly fruity accents of pulverized raisins and varied stone fruits dipped in brandy. Small dash of bitter herbs. A few drops of creme caramel for some late-breaking sweetness, maybe even some slight chocolate as it warms. Low bitterness at best. Smoked cloves, maybe a pinch of black pepper provides some enduring zing. Stays a bit sweet at the end, but, then it manages to close out near-dry and warming.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-high carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel.

Overall: Its a tasty dubbel that, thankfully, doesnt hit hard with any cloying sweetness or enamel-dissolving ethanol bursts. Sadly, I havent had it since that very first Saints club shipment all those many long years ago.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

561,"2011-03-07",3.8,"Poured into a goblet. Bottle is from sometime in 2010 (I think). Theres sure as hell no lack of carbonation in this one. The cork was eager to be freed from the bottle and the first pour yielded twice as much head as liquid.

4.0 A: Nearly clear deep amber/mahogany color. Two and a half fingers of frothy light brown head after second pour. The head is maintained quite well, which is in part thanks to the furious bubbling from the nucleation etches on the bottle of the glass. Theres a decent amount of lacing and if the head were a bit stickier, there would be an incredible amount of lacing. Either way, good here.

4.0 S: Raisin and plum, figs and dates. Belgian yeast spiciness and a dirt earthiness. Crystal malts and candi sugar. Really nice aroma, but could use a steroid injection as it is a bit weak.

4.0 T: The taste mainly follows the nose - lots of raisin, tobacco, and fig. Dates and plum on the next level down. Spicy Belgian yeast, earthy muskiness that almost tastes like a nuttiness, candi sugar, and crystal malts. Pretty damn good.

3.5 M: Light to lighter medium body. Initially overcarbonated, but became good spritzy carbonation after enough swirls. Creamy for how light the body is and super smooth. My only complain here is that the body is too thin. I dont think the thin body was the intent here and I also think that the overcarbonation wasnt intended either. Something makes me think that the two are related.

4.0 D: Well, what can I say. For as much as I hate Tomme Arthur, he can make a pretty good brew when he can get it carbonated. This is right up there with most of its native counterparts. If I could trust that every bottle would be this good (read: carbonated) I might even be willing to pay the premium that Lost Abbey commands. Great taste and good overall except for the lack of body.

561,"2010-03-06",3.4,"Pours about the color of sherry with very little head (something that appears to be largely characteristic of this brewery).  Nose is mostly alcohol, but with a bit of the fig and raison coming through.  Taste is very mild and slightly sweet with, again, fig, raison, and plum flavors.  Not bad, but sort of blah.  I think the Allagash Dubbel Reserve is a much better beer as far as domestic beers of the style go.

561,"2010-01-11",3.4,"Enjoyed from a 750ml bottle in a whiskey snifter.  The beer pours a deep mohogany/brown, with an ample light tan head.  The aroma is initially quite grainy, far more so that I would have expected.  Pilsner malt makes itself evident, as does a bit of raisony caramel character.  Yet, it perceptibly lacks the deep and rich malt/dark fruit aromas that some good examples of the style possess.  The palate is also somewhat less full than one would expect from a brewery the caliber of Lost Abbey.  Carbonation is slightly too high, giving the palate a thin and almost insipid character.  Again caramel/raison/burnt sugar flavors are there, but in far too subtle a manner.  The finish carries some yeast-derived esters characteristic of the Abbey ale strain, but it is again a touch too subtle.  Overall, a rather disappointing experience from a great brewery.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

Pours out a deep ruddy brown with a nice finger thick tan head to it. No carbonation problems here. Aroma is nice full of rich wood and earthy notes followed by a sweetness of raisins, vanillia, cherries, and figs. Here comes my possible mistake, I wonder if the bottle of Sinners 09 and its overall sourness shot my palate because for some reason this beers flavor did not stand out well and actually had a bit of a sour taste to me as well. Carbonation was lively and made itself known without overpowering. Yeast was a bit doughy on this one and towards the bottom of the bottle it became a bit unpleasant, too much yeast in suspension takes away from the flavor (again this could have been my fault with too rough of a pour). Sweet flavors try to come out in the form of figs and candied sugar but still that sourness remained. Anyway a good effort by Lost Abbey, and I would certainly sample again.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","rayg1"

561,"2009-06-14",3.9,"(750 ml bottle from Kappys, cellared for 10 mos. after purchase) Pours dark reddish-amber with less than a finger of khaki head that dissipates rather quickly to a thin layer. Aroma of brown sugar, candy-malt, dark fruit, toasted caramel and molasses. Quite nice although I didnt specifically detect raisins.  Mouthfeel is fairly smooth, a bit sticky. Also seemed to lose its carbonation rather quickly. Flavor of dense dark fruits, candy malt, spice, dark caramel and a bit of smoke. Perhaps some red wine. The spice is almost cinnamon-like and reminds me of something like Southampton Abbott 12 perhaps. Pretty sweet, maybe just a little too much so. Lightly hot. The density of aroma and flavor is almost quad-like. Pretty good but sort of tailed off on me as I drank the bottle instead of getting better or at least holding its own.

This is really more typical of an Abt/Quad or a Belgian Strong style than the usual Dubbel. The malt back bone is not as pronounced as most and the phenolic/ester from the yeast really comes forward.

561,"2008-09-29",3.2,"Deep crimson. Vigorous pour yields merely a thin cap of beige foam which quickly diminishes. Simplistic nose of yeast (banana taffy, wet paint), plummy malt, pear, peppery alcohol, and floral hop whispers. Soft fuzzy pricks of subdued carbonation. Poor attenuation is evident from the start, as banana-tinged yeast and sugary malts lead the way. Plummy and slightly raisiny from the combination of fruity esters and malt-driven sweetness, though things are far from bright. Borderline medicinal as the spicy alcohol compounds the strongly sugary qualities. Vibrant hint of bubblegum is obscured by the sweetness. Faint note of plastic imparts some unpleasantness late, and the yeast is quite prominent and dirty, disallowing the malts to thrive. The body suffers, as does the overall complexity, due to the simple malt frame which possesses little to no bready softness or refined richness. Omnipresence of yeast continually wreaks havoc as it clings to the palate and deposits a pasty film. Shows some improvement while nearing the finish, as the candy sugar and a meaty dab of molasses produce a cleaner sweetness which helps keep the medicinal notes at bay. Closes with an alcoholic bite, though the malt provides a salvaging glimpse of softness to the otherwise sweet and simple finish.

Yeast flavor dominated with sweet brown suger with a port like aftertaste.  Alcohol discernable. Moderate fruitynes. The astringency seemed to fade as the bottle was consumed. Only a moderate body.  An OK ale, not as good as many Belgian Dubbels, but rather enjoyable. Smoothe finish.","Longmont, Colorado, USA","Pompey"

561,"2008-08-27",3.6,"Objectively speaking:
Pleasant albeit unremarkable brown Belgian.

I like:
The bold maltiness of a scotch ale with strong caramel emphasis, but also toasty, spicy and highly fruity nuances. Alcohol sensation is never too much. Almost roasty malt notes manages to maintain the sweetness level under watch. Authentic mouthfeel if a bit thick.

I dislike:
I find it hard to recommend changes on dubbels, I find it hard to find one I feel deserves a 4.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

561,"2008-06-02",3.8,"750mL Bottle. This took forever for me to get around to drinking. This beer was approximately 1 year old. A 2007, drank in 2008. Corked with a light spritz and slowly dying carbonation. Aroma cast a glow of settled, alcohol infused tannic fruits. Definitely some undeniable golden raisin shadows over a glow of lightly toasted caramels, sweet onion glaze and fruitcake. Typically phenolic and still a little warm. Poured in red-brown, lightly hazed with a rim of off-white. Flavor presented well-melded characters running the gamut from condensed sugar raisin bread to salted figs and balsamic, back to the lighter side of apricots. Fruity and minerally. The Lost Abbey yeast and mineral character settles in and braces the alcohol against the malt. Works well with Carne Adobado. I do appreciate that the malt flavors are well-intergrated, sweet, but not syrupy and playing well off of the alcohol. Complex, but not crazy. Starting to show a nip of age. The faintest, dustiest wisper of hops hopes to corner some of the gin sugars, but doesnt get very far. Obviously a decent Dubbel, but maybe not one that I would grab again, as I would look for a little more darkness, depth and drinkability.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Mouthfeel is fitting for the flavor.  Drinkable but not on the top of my list overall.  Just a bit more alcohol than I wanted to notice.","Austin, Texas, USA","pintsize"
561,"2008-03-04",2.9,"Pours a muddy caramel color with some yeast in the glass.  Nice beige head.  Smell is oddly refreshing and minty with some alcohol presence.  Taste is rather mundane with perhaps a hint of belgian yeast, light malt flavor, and again an alcohol presence that comes through as almost minty again.  Drinkable, and not really offensinve, as the flavor is so mild, but nothing really screamed great beer about this one, to me.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"

561,"2008-03-03",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 27, 2009 In short: Intense Dubbel.  Rich nutty/fruity body and powerful hopping.  One of my favourite of the style.
How: Bottle, 750ml, various aging (little variation), this rating for a 6+ months old bottle
The look: Cloudy golden-brown body with a medium beige head
In long: Strong nutty and caramel nose with also quite a bit of resinous hops.  Taste is like eating one of those grocery store bags of mix stuff (nuts, raisins, dried fruits) covered by rich caramel.  Some earthy notes.  The intense citric and resinous hops really sets it apart from most dubbels.  So tasty that you want to drink it slowy.  Body is just more decadent as a big \barley wine.  Dubbels dont get much better than that.  I got a lot of satisfaction from the Lost & Found, but still no sign of my missing gloves.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

561,"2008-02-10",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2009 C&C 750, no date. Pours into my trusty Chimay glass a clear, brilliant mahogany red with a thin beige head. Nose is spicy dark fruits - fig and raisin primarily, with allspice and light anise, touched with roasty malt. Flavor is quite different - spice really takes over, a weird funky note creeps in, like bad nuts. The fruitiness comes through a bit as it warms up, the anise and allspice coming on strong. Strange, and not one Ill be on the lookout for.

Very young flavor. Hot hot hot alcohol throughout. Dark fruits and rum come to mind. The mouthfeel is syrupy and cloying, but oddly thin in the finish. A good beer for sure, but needs some time in a cool, dark place to develop. I just noticed this is a Dubbel. What? Says who? Cause this sure as hell didnt taste like no Dubbel to me.

561,"2007-08-15",3.6,"From a 750mL Bottle.  Mild pop upon un-corking the bottle.  Pours a transparent, fiery black cherry color with a finger of creamy beige head.  Impressive clarity; its like looking into one of those king marbles that appears to be black from a distance, but reveals a deep ruby color on close inspection.  Head fizzles a bit quickly, leaving a blotchy layer of uneven sea suds floating aimlessly on top; a quick swirl of the glass sends the foam rebuilding in the right direction.  Lots of raisin in the nose, along with some mild vanilla and dusty, woody yeast esters that have a subtle mace-like quality.  Toasted chestnuts and creme brulee sugar.  Intriguingly complex nose, but not overwhelming - patience is necessary for full appreciation.  Medium bodied, creamy carbonated mouthfeel.  Carbonation is a bit on the light side and could use a bit of a zip to help accentuate the spicy characters.  Notes of shaved nutmeg and coconut shell start out on the palate, but fade with the carbonation, leaving a somewhat blander coating of thin raisin juice left sitting on the tongue.  I want to say it has a fig like fruitiness, but its as if the fig spice flees with the carbonation, leaving a somewhat less interesting fruit character behind.  Dry enough and not sweet, but far from being light and crisp.  Finishes dark and leathery, with some chewy tobacco and oaky raisin skins left lingering on the palate.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

561,"2007-05-26",3.7,"The durable yellowish foam and deep crimson body suggest, at the outset, a beer of quality and pedigree. With a wink to St. Bernardus, the nose breathes of custard and fig. Hinting also to coriander and caramel, the scents are subtle and hide beneath a predominant mineral water quality. Fruit flavors reminiscent of fig and plum are balanced by malted intonations of dark caramel and illusory coffee. Pepper and custard add familiar connotations to an otherwise dilute body  unfortunately allowing too much alcohol to transpare. As the beer warms, a faint complexity appears: hop and orange peel lead to dried apricot and pear, as well as raisin. Finishing with nutmeg and a note of hot anise, Lost and Found is a brew that tries as it can to imitate tradition but is only somewhat successful. An enjoyable effort but I wouldnt chose it over any of the Trappists.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

561,"2007-04-20",4.1,"Pours a muddy red/brown with some yellow highlights and moderate head.  Most things about this beer are better when youve got all that sediment poured in the glass, including the aroma.  Raisins are pretty noticable here, but theres some light banana, some cloves and other spices, some caramel and candy sugar.  Strong and totally inviting.  Taste is sweet and earthy, some slight raisins at first, but quickly overtaken by some caramel brown sugar, tobacco, dirt/leaves, and persistant burnt toast dryness.  The dryness on the tongue is a little off in the first glass, but with the cloudy glass is nice and well integrated in the profile.  Finishes with more toast, light coffee, leaves and butterscotch.  There still some effevescent yeast and fruit to brighten the flavor a bit, but you detext in the back of your nose and dont really taste it.  Thats fine by me.

The head atop it was beige, a little shy of two finger thick, and craggy.  The smell was lighter than I was expecting, with a floral and soured fruit profile.  The taste was sweet and rummy, and not quite as dry as the true Belgian examples Ive sampled before.  The carbonation was prickly in the mouth as result of the thinner than normal body, and the alcohol was also quite evident.

561,"2007-02-16",3.9,"2006 bottle drunk on 2/3/07Terrific presentation.  Deep auburn-tinted mahogany body shows a medium to medium-high clarity, leaving the unfiltered sediment behind.  Beige head is large, rocky and well-retained, leading to much lacing down the glass.Light phenols, dark fruit esters and gentle, sweet, pale malts all come off very subtley, as the barest hint of roast (chocolate malt) creeps in on the edges.  A fair amount of breadiness and a definite hard candy-like feel from the crystal malt, which works against the softness, but gives light (and dry) toffee/caramel notes that seem apt for the style.  I dont get much raisin, neither from the actual raisins nor the special B, but thats fine, as there shouldnt be a prominent note of it anyways.  Rather, it is all much more homogenous, with prunes, raisins, and date notes all blending together to give a stickiness that also helps keep the crystal malt from creating too hard an aroma.  Black pepper phenolics and just a brushstroke of clove/banana dot the finish, while a touch of alcohol heat is notable upon warming.  I really like the grain bill here, though I dont usually like crystal malts.  But they add enough assertiveness to what would otherwise be too soft and possibly mushy.Concord grapes, chocolate-covered cherries and vanilla cream-like malt sweetness all burst forth in the flavor and then scatter, leaving light peppery phenols, dry crystal malt and hints of roast.  Really nice attenuation, being lightly sweet, and very chewy, but also dry enough to be able to drink it quite quenchingly.  Yeast dosent pump out much clove, fusel or bananas, which is always appreciated and the carbonation is very tight and engaging.  Piquant dark fruits stick to the palate and linger on the finish, being contrasted to black pepper-like dryness and dry toffee/caramel notes.  Very complex dubbel.  I really like the chewiness and almost waxy-smooth yeast/crystal malt synergy combined with the fruity special b.  Reminds me, in some ways, of Westy 8 (though the overall flavors are much different).  Maybe a bit on the sweet side overall.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

561,"2007-01-11",3.7,"Bottle and served in my St. Bernardus chalice: Poured a rich deep mahogany hue with an initial fizzy head which left a small ring and some lace. The nose detects plum, starfruit, fig, candi and brown sugar, toasted bready malts, hint of spicy hops and a smack of phenolic activity.  The taste is quite fruity and earthy malt dominated, not that it is such a bad thing. I get a mix of undertones in the middle of vanilla, oak, musty and dusty yeast, and a pinch of marzipan. The finish is quite spicy really (clove and ginger I found) and the aggressive carbonation makes this unique. Perhaps a chalky and somewhat  mineral aftertaste is its downfall for I enjoy this more when tasting and less so after it was done.  Worth a try but be forewarned this is not a prime example of a old world dubbel.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

It poured a lazy, hazy chestnut with a level thin beige pad that held to my amazement. Generous, spiced, winter warmer nose - had that herbally infused, thick, hot cocoa mix melded with heavily clad, peppery spices, that savoury fruitcake blend before its added to the dough, edges of raw tree-bark and some burnt sugar just on end to twist the nostril hairs. It swiftly changes form on the palate for here it is discernibly nutty, dry, woody and dusty. The very tip holds all of what of the sweetness, a dark honey taste, maybe some powdered chocolate and a drift towards hazelnut praline. It is mouth-filling with flavour, though, hugely malty but not overdone. Age selective malts, raw, yeast extracted depth mid-palate, slight roasted tang in back, silky as it moves across. Body is creamy, medium beyond the nice feel. Finish is dry, again showing so much malt, that nutty flavour peaks here, a little earth and dust linger, fade gently.

Thanks to Facto for bringing this along.  It is my first Lost Abbey and hopefully not my last.  After this sample I may be trying to trade for some in the future.  This was a perfect example of an abbey dubbel.  Easy to drink, pleasant to look at and well balanced this should be on everyones want list if you have not had it yet.
Aroma / Appearance - Raspberry, dark chocolate, honeysuckle form a sweet mixture of delightful aromas.  The mocha colored head protects a caramel hued body which lacks any lacing.
Flavor / Palate - Honey, caramel, rye and yeast form the first impression.  Next comes some vinous notes not unlike a good white wine.  Finally the semi-sweet dry finish washes away on the tongue.  It fades a little too quickly for my liking because I could savor it for quite a while.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

561,"2006-12-17",3.4,"UPDATED: OCT 2, 2007 Impressions from the YeHa! party (and later bottles):
-A veil of foam covers the hazy pale brown.
-Drying dark fruit and orange zest over slowly toasting bread; a complex yet never stirring aroma.
-Roastiness is well integrated to the berry/date infusion and chocolate sweetness.
-Yeast swirls around the flavor profile and influences it quite a bit, effectively merging with cocoa towards the end.
-Carbonation is perfectly authentic for a Belgian style.
-This is a complex and quite drinkable dubbel, but this first encounter proved to be somewhat underwhelming. Later on, in personal bottle encounters, I noticed any added yeast to the glass deterred greatly from the enjoyment of the beers complexity. Next bottles I open, I will make sure no yeast particle enters the beer.

561,"2006-11-09",4.2,"Aromatic notes of rum soaked raisins, prunes and figs sweetly waft to my nose as I pour this brew.  It is well carbonated and forms a frothy, initially four-finger thick, amber tan colored head.  The beer shows a brilliantly clear, amber plum color as I pour it into my tulip glass, otherwise it sits an opaque, plum tinted, dark amber color.  When I dig more into the aroma I get a vibrant fruity note that is made up of a combination of plums, apples and of course the prior mentioned concentrated, dark fruit notes.  There is a nice malty layer in the nose as well that makes me think of notes of caramel, sweet breads and a hint of brown sugar.  There is something like a low, underlying tartness here as well; the combination of tartness and fruitiness reminds me of tamarind.

The taste is sweet up front, yet it is quickly balanced by a spicy finish.  There is a certain full mouthfeel here that coats the palate a bit.  There are lots of flavors that definitely linger in the mouth.  I get spicy notes of pepper, clove and ginger as well as a zippy carbonation which helps the spice notes to linger on in the tongue.  Rum and fruit notes provide a sweetness & and a satiating heft to this brew; this is definitely working as an after dinner treat right now.  The mix of alcohol and dark fruity notes remind me of a rich, dark, candied fruit laden and Rum soaked cake that has a spicy side to it.  A touch of chalkiness is also here and it almost makes me thing that this has a certain musty quality, though not quite.

This is really quite tasty.  It is much richer, in many ways, than I was expecting.  It does not have the dryness that one would expect from a good Belgian version, but it is far from cloying (like many American interpretations often are).  This is a great beer for the colder months, even here in Arizona.  I am really enjoying this brew; it is one of those beers whose parts (which are quite good already) combine to create a whole that is better than any of the individual components.

561,"2006-11-07",3.5,"750ml bottle from the cooler at Papago: Pours to a mostly opaque dark copper/brown color, does show bits of amber when held to the light.  The head is medium height, tan colored, and sticks nicely atop the beer.  The aroma is dark fruits, raisin, plum, more prune/plum than raisin really, showing plenty of sugary/thick malt scents in the nose, some carrots, mild spice.  Taste is sweet, but not overly so, showing a very malty sweetness as the groundwork - carrot, figs, raisins, light molasses-soaked bread - with some hints of light smoke, yeast, light spice, and some mild esters.  Medium-full bodied, lively carbonated.  This one is good but doesnt quite live up to some of the better Belgian abbey dubbels out there.  For some reason this tastes like a homebrewers attempt to clone a classic dubbel.  Its quite good, but somehow theres something missing that I just cant quite put my finger on.  Perhaps its something in the body, too clean of a yeast character, or something else.

The palate is smooth and slightly fizzy with almost no bitterness in the aftertaste. On the bottom of the bottle is a thick lovely layer of yeast, and it pours slightly hazy with a stable rocky head. Brilliant! I miss some complexity and yeast-funk found in the best Belgian dubbels, but this is definitely worth trying!","Copenhagen, DENMARK","ChristianSA"
561,"2006-10-07",3.3,"Bottle courtesy of Naven.  An average abbey double.  Nothing special.  Nothing stands out, but definitely not a bad beer.  Candy sugar w/ mild smokey flavor.","Freeport, Georgia, USA","jimbowood"
561,"2006-10-04",3.4,"GABF 06. Cant say enough great things about the samples I had from this brewery. This beer was hazy, medium oxidized brown-gold colored with an average-sized, frtohy, beige, mostly lasting head. The aromas first puff to those nose of heavy with sweet pipe tobacco and dried fruit. It was malty with a light note of toasted grain; Hoppy with a moderate note of fresh herbs; Yeasty with a light note of dough; Intriguing miscellaneous notes of moderately weighty pipe tobacco that blooms and fades, a light note of dandelion juice an a moderate note of burbon. The flavor was lightly acidic, lightly bittersweet with a moderately bittersweet, longish, warm finish. Trace of astringency on the gums. The body was light, the texture was watery and the carbonation was lively. This ones on the list, for sure.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","luckygirl"
561,"2006-10-04",3.7,"GABF 06.  Hazy brown.  Aroma is banana esters, spices, yeast, caramel malts.  Taste is caramel malts, fruity esters, raisins (dark fruits) and spices.  pretty well done.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
561,"2006-10-02",3.0,"GABF 2006.  Bottle.  The beer is very murky caramel brown.  The aroma is extremely raisiny, bubble gum, and sweet candi sugar.  Surprisingly not clowing in aroma.  The flavor is sweet, lightly burnt candi sugar, yellow raisins, something just doesnt meld right.  The palate is overly sweet.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
561,"2006-10-02",3.5,"Ill start with saying that I tried all the lost abbey series at GABF and found w/ the exception of the tommee that they are all pretty overrated and share a similar yeast characteristic.
Cloudy off yellowish brown color nice light tan head.  Odd bready yeasty aroma hints of dark fruits raisens hints of banannas.  palate is fluffy and well coated.  Flavor is banannas all spice clove and candied sugars.  Ok.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
