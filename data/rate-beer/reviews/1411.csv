1411,"2007-12-02",3.3,"Had this beer on 11/3/1999.  Aroma is a nicely roasted malt scent.  Color is a crisp clear amber with what looks like very light carbonation but the head looks very good.  Taste is lightly roasted and creamy.  Starting with a medium body and goes down with a  roasted edge.  Finish is mildly roasted malt flavor backed by a fair bitterness and a creamy feel.  Its not a rich cold day kind of winter brew, its more of a lightly roasted fresh drinking brew.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","RSRIZZO"

1411,"2004-12-13",3.3,"Im not sure why they pulled this beer as their winter seasonal, much better than the snow plow in my opinion. On tap at the widmer brewhouse, aged one year. This brew pours a darker mahogany/amber with a small white head. Aroma has a toasty malt start, lightly fruity, small amount of spice. Taste starts with a smooth caramel malt, then is followed with some roasty fruits, and finishes with a smaller bitterness, light spicing. The bitterness lingers a bit in the finish. A nice brew with a decent alcohol content.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"

Dark amber colored with a large, minutely bubbled cream colored head that lasts and drapes lace everywhere--really impressive structure!

1411,"2003-12-07",3.5,"Great head that lasts and makes a mess of your glass. Has a nice warm reddish color that most amber beers wish they had. Kind of a one-trick-pony in the taste department. Starts out mild and finishes with a strong bitter flavor... and that's it. I was hoping for a more complex flavor but it doesn't deliver. A bit more wattery that I would like for a ""Winter"" beer, which I expect to be a bit thicker than average. Medium body. Dry texture. Reminds me of other beers I can get year-round. Overall it's a very good beer and I'll drink it again if placed in my face, but I probably won't seek it out.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","god"

Mahogany brown beer with an excellent off white creamy/foamy head..nice carbonation.
Aroma is spicy and malty but not excellent.
Yes typical Altbier taste bit above average..starts strong and fades towards the end..small hop bite.
Nice and creamy smooth..never tasted the alcohol..but felt it afterwards.
Nice drinkable Alt..but i prefer Full Sails limited release Comet Ale as an Alt..if you see Comet buy it!..and this too its ok.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"

A bit of an anticlimax for beer #100.  Guess the same could be said for round-numbered birthdays and PhDs...
Nothing *wrong* with this brew, but at ecrvich says, ""even judged as an altbier...I'm calling this one's bluff""
It's sadly lacking as a true ""Winter"" beer, and doesn't deserve the 3.71 rating it receives here. 
This is a slightly-above-average amber ale.  No terrible faults, though quite timid.
Pours with a disappointingly small, offwhite, fine-textured, lacy head, with deep amber color and amber carbonation.
Unpleasant aroma; mainly old shoes and rubber bands, with a hair or sweet malt.
Quite warming (makes sense now that I see the 7% ABV).  Lots of protein to simulate a full mouthfeel, but oddly thin at the same time.
Medium bitterness, lightly citric, disappointingly lightly malty.  I detected no obvious specialty malts, and possibly a bit of spice (cinnamon).  Ho-hum.","Stanford, California, USA","mpbro"
1411,"2003-02-14",4.1,"this was really good. A good brown/amber color (a bit darker than in the pic) nice rich taste. I love the ""Prost"" on the underside of the cap. I thouroughly enjoyed how this one went down.","Florida, USA","SAEEJam99"

1411,"2003-01-02",4.3,"A truly enjoyable beer that offers the perfect blend of hops and malt with enough alcohol to kick it up a notch that makes for an excellent warming beer for all of those cold and wet winter nights. Pours a rich dark brown with plenty of head room and reasonable glass lacing. Has a very sweet, almost spicey tendency in its aroma but presents itself with a very smooth aftertaste complete with hints of caramel and chocolate. An excelent choice for the winter blues.","British Columbia, CANADA","49degrees"

A nice beer thats great considering its on tap in Hastings!","San Francisco, California, USA","mwsf"
1411,"2002-12-18",4.0,"Nice amber color with minimal head.  This beer is somewhat light for a winter brew but it does have a good flavor to compensate for the lack of ""bigness.""  The aroma is not strong but blends smoothly into the flavor as you take a sip.  The flavor is hoppy, with the malt undertones rolling in behind it to finish off the taste.  Very slightly dry but still quenching.  A good balance between hop and winter warmer maltiness.","Seattle, Washington, USA","schm1005"
1411,"2002-12-17",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2003 Release 2003
As it sets in the glass an unclouded deep mahogany with the head portly in size, a winsome light tan color and the texture semi-creamy with oodles of lace to cover the glass. Nose is malt sweet, hints of spices, cinnamon and vanilla come to mind, start is ambrosial with a pleasing malt profile, top is fair to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish delectable in its carbonation with the hops subdued and pleasant, quite dry aftertaste that leaves a bit of tartness on the palate, a very drinkable beer, surely not the best Winter beer, but one that is quite refreshing and dependable in its quality which means a lot to me.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"

Gently roasty and toasty with a soft sweetness. Some bitter hops and burnt toast complement nicely. 7% is hidden well, but this beer is still cozy.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
1411,"2002-12-14",3.2,"Clear copper body with medium, light-tan head.  Aroma is sweet caramel tinged with nice spiciness and perhaps banana.  Sweet maltiness is dominant, also some floral hoppiness.  Minimally bitter in the swallow and aftertaste, but even then theres more sweetness than bitterness.  Im missing the roastiness thats supposed to be here.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
1411,"2002-12-13",3.0,"Interesting malt...banana and roasted nut. Almost no hop presence and extremely sweet. Finish is kind of weak as the malt rolls off the tongue and your left with little more than a lingering taste of candy sugar. Not very impressionable, and there are some unidentified flavors (some bitter) that are kind of confusing, though not necessarily appealing.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"

1411,"2002-11-21",2.7,"Head is initially small, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is clear dark amber. Aroma is lightly malty (caramel, toasted light bread), lightly hoppy (flowers). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation.  Whimpering simple aroma and somewhat unbalanced flavor profile (too sweet), even judged as an altbier (on or off steroids), so Im calling this ones bluff.  The mouthfeel is the best thing about it.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Although categorized as an altbier, Winternacht is for all observable purposes a winter warmer/english strong ale--and one of the better ones. A lovely, enigmatic aroma that I will characterize as   vanilla bourbon candied malt with a dash of spruce.

The ones Ive always favored have been heavier, darker, likely non-traditional sorts exemplified in my eyes by the one at the Arbor Brewing Company.  This one seems to be more traditional but is still very good: a beautiful ruby color in the class and a strong, heady aroma start you off in good shape!  The roasted flavour in this thing is actually subdued considerable, IMO, controlled a harmonzing lift of hops.  Actually, the malt action plays base notes behind the hops saxaphoning, when all is said and done, imparting strength and substance to the spicy hopping.  I like it.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
