396,"2015-12-15",3.8,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
 Appearance- The beer pours a medium golden amber color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a good deal of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the beer is weird. It has a sweet caramel smell mixed with a little bit of a green coffee smell. A decent showing of vanilla is there as well. Now these are really not all that weird in general, but with a mix of some other sweet cream soda and a bit of corn, the overall aroma is sweet, but vanilla flavored coffee like in nature. Its not bad, but just somewhat weird. 
 Taste- The taste begins with a rather strong bready flavor mixed with a decent creaminess and caramel flavor. A surge of more cream and vanilla come at the middle and take the taste to the end. That is where a little bit of a lightly roasted coffee taste hits the tongue. With more vanilla and some corn sweetness that comes to the tongue at the very end, one is left with a rather interesting light coffee and sweet crème taste to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel- The body of the beer is on the on the medium to thin side with a carbonation level that is slightly higher. For the crème ale style mixed with the light coffee and sweeter tastes, the feel was rather nice and made for a good easy drinking feel.
 Overall  This was an interesting one. I was not that fond of it at first sips, but it really grew on me more and more as I continued to drink it. It has a sorta odd flavor mix of crème, coffee, and sweet, which in some ways really works. Any which way, I would certainly recommend a try to anyone as it is somewhat unique in nature.","","Darkmagus82"

396,"2015-11-16",3.5,"5.5%ABV. Cream Ale.

Poured out of the bottle a slightly cloudy deep amber. 14ºSRM.

Nose is dominated by the additives of coffee and vanilla. There is a smoky sweetness to the nose. Like a French roast. There is also a buttery creaminess to the nose.

Mouthfeel is carbonated and sudsy. There is a round fruitiness to the palate which then transitions into a roasty, nutty flavors of graham cracker, toast and nuts like roasted almonds and hazelnuts. This is a well done cream ale with the cream-corn flavor that comes out only after all the other flavors of the additives have vanished. 

The combination of the smoke, vanilla and the chocolate component of the palate all add up to give a recurring and very persistent impression of smores. 

Palate is brief and not very interesting at all. Overall, a very ably put together ale. Good job, guys!","SINGAPORE","drjoeng"

396,"2015-10-30",4.0,"Bottle. Nose of dirty vanilla, dirt itself, mild coffee beans [[and porter]]. Really has the smack of a moist dessert cake, one you might find in a shabby off-beat Austrian cafe. Pours deep, rich clear orange with a slow-forming but frothy and oily cream head. Taste dry for attenuation, very faint sweetness rising form the vanilla and the yeast, which still spikes its little esters in there from below, will not be silenced! The portery character is not there like I expected [or perhaps just imagined?], its much more rich/luscious coffee beans that Id mistaken, but the flavor is still quite nice, and the vanilla and coffee are kept to low enough levels that they never grate, never cloy.  True restraint.  Little flecks of orange and lemon here and there, and a medicinal sort of syrup in the deep, deep background, and subtle wisps of caramel and butter for rounding out the feel and the short aftertaste.  Full body but not fat, lightly crisp but not heavy, smooth and moreish despite the gravity, malt is weak but not thin or underthought, and theres a beautiful, balanced melding of three disparate elements (the coffee, the vanilla, and the fruity light cream ale).

Taking the VAS profile and putting it in a cream ale sounds so logical! But it did not work for me. Strong coffee and vanilla in a light, thin base just didnt do it.

396,"2015-10-06",3.1,"Bon, ceci est la bière la plus inusité que jai bu de ma vie. Une golden cream ale au café et à la vanille. Achetée à Winooski et recommandée par mon ami Scott (thanks man for this uncommon brew!), la bière est dorée, voire orangée. Même en la versant avec vigueur dans mon verre, je peine à y voir laspect crémeux annoncé. La mousse est bien présente mais mes attentes morientaient davantage vers un truc semblable aux cream ale poussées à lazote. Le problème est sans doute de mon côté mais enfin. Jolis lacings sur le verre. Jusquici tout semble à peu près normal... En approchant le verre de mon nez à la fois intrigué et inquiet, je suis attaqué par de puissants arômes dextraits de vanille! Même si on sy attend, cest déstabilisant, un peu comme lire le mot bleu alors quil est écrit en vert. Il y a quelque-chose qui cloche profondément. À cette vanille artificielle sajoutent des arômes poussiéreuses, terreuses, sucrées et lourdes; un peu à la manière dun mauvais porter. En bouche, le liquide jouit dune belle densité. Jaurais mis ma main à couper quil sagit dun porter dans une vraie dégustation à laveugle. Texture peu soyeuse; voire un peu sèche et râpeuse. La vanille est encore artificielle ici et le café annoncé sur létiquette est des plus discrets. Je peine à le percevoir. Peut-être est-ce simplement car mon cerveau refuse de le reconnaître dans une bière de cette clareté. Bref, cette bière est très intéressante pour lexpérience sensorielle quelle procure. Est-elle bonne? Je ne crois pas. Je demeure toute de même très heureux davoir confronté mes sens à un liquide si... unique!","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

396,"2015-09-13",3.7,"So hungry and so ready for a beer this Sunday morning. Ive decided to go ahead and make it a real weekend day and have a beer for breakfast, and what better way to celebrate a lazy, chore-filled (Ill just take my time) day than to start off with a huge breakfast and a coffee-infused brew.
As I peel back the top, the sweet coffee is prominent, a bit of bread in the background. The pour is burnished gold, deep and clear with a listless foam, soft and dense. I pull at the brew and love the immediate flavors of dark roasted coffee with a touch of cream; vanilla stepping in and flooding my sinuses as I breathe out. I place the glass and watch as the foam slips slowly down the sides, slipping easily back into the body of the beer. The carbonation is soft and light, but carries the slightly bitter, slightly sweet flavors with little effort throughout the swallow. The light action, the depth of flavor and the consistent and comfortable finish is consuming and I want only to taste it again and again.

This is a tasty, alcoholic cream soda. Just needs a creamier finish for the full-effect. Refreshing for warm weather.

396,"2015-08-27",3.5,"Golden color or light, light orange. Thick shaving cream head. From the label, I assumed it would be black or brown, but no dice.

The first sniff is dry, dusty iced coffee. Touch of hazelnut. Vanilla sticks, the dry kind, not the milky kind you may think of. There is a touch of ""skunk"" but I mean actual skunk, not skunked beer. 

The first sip, like the aroma, is cold coffee. The vanilla is an accent, but its dominated by mocha and coffee grounds. Its almost like when you brew a cup of coffee and it still has some of the grounds at the bottom and you swallow some of them, without the grit of course. The ""cream ale"" part is a distant third, with a touch of corn sugars. 

Feel is creamy slickness. This may be the new trend in the next year: a pale ale with dark flavors like coffee and vanilla. There is a bit of cognitive dissonance in looking at it and then sipping it.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"
396,"2015-08-27",3.8,"Coffee and vanilla are flavor additives you usually associated with a stout or porter. But with Calm Before the Storm, Ballast Point shows these ingredients can work just as well in a lighter brew. Its interesting that they went with a cream ale to try this with, though its rather moot since the base brew really is overshadowed by the coffee and vanilla. You might consider this a novelty beer, but I consider it a good beer.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 7/13/15 and cost $3.85 ($0.32 per ounce).

Appearance: Surprisingly dark copper/amber hue (its golden on the brewerys website); pours to a small, ivory, foamy head which doesnt retain or lace all that well.

Smell: A sweet iced coffee scent; I can actually detect a bit of corn, too. They dont clash, though.

Taste: This beer is intended to be a warmer weather alternative to an imperial stout brewed with the same flavors. Its certainly an interesting choice and it does work pretty well. The coffee is evident immediately, but its not deeply roasted and extremely bitter; more of an iced coffee with sugar and cream. The vanilla gives it a bit of a chocolate candy flavor. I dont detect the base brew until the finish when a bit of corn emerges. At first its an odd, slightly distracting flavor, but I get used to it quickly. Only a mild bitterness on the backend with a slight drying sensation. It doesnt get any more complex than this, but these flavors are enjoyable enough to make for a good beer.

Drinkability: I was a bit surprised to see Ballast Point Calm Before The Storm was only 5.5% ABV. I was expecting this to be a stronger brew. The mouthfeel is a bit calm and a little thinner than Id prefer. Its crisp as it goes down and theres only a mild iced coffee aftertaste which eventually fades completely. I would not consider it refreshing, nor would I consider it so richly sweet that it works as a dessert beer (at least not on its own).

The taste was sticky sweet with the vanilla taking hold to gloss over the sweet contour of the cocoa. Light bitter coffee beans come back nicely. A smooth sweet vanilla/coffee aftertaste rolls into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a really nice sessionability about it. Carbonation runs nice and smooth underneath. Not as creamy on my tongue, but nice. 
Overall, for a cream ale, this one is a bit different, mostly hits the marks of the style. A bit different, but I say try it if you see it.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

396,"2015-08-17",3.0,"Bottle from Winooski. Clear amber gold pour with thin white head. Aroma is absolutely laden with coffee, very surprising intensity of coffee, vegetal cold brew notes, light roastiness, very mild vanilla aroma. Taste is slightly sweet, corn, vanilla, white cake, with a coffee finish but not very bitter at all, interesting. Palate is med bodied with light carbonation. Interesting beer, but overall not something Id really want to drink again.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

396,"2015-08-17",3.2,"Sampled on draft at 3R6P this beer poured a dark orange-caramel color with a medium sized foamy off white head that left decent lacing. The aroma was vanilla and tangy malts. The flavor was vanilla, malty, bread, honey and a bit of tangy fruit underneath. No coffee that I could detect. Medium length tangy finish with lingering vanilla. Medium body and smooth. Ok.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"
396,"2015-08-16",3.1,"I find cream ale to be one of the worst styles of beer. Typically bland and flavorless. This one is different, and it makes me wonder why they chose a cream ale at all. In any event, it is gold, ititially tall but quickly fading head and well carbonated, it looks like a lager. I can smell the coffee while pouring, and when my nose is to the glass, I get the vanilla as well. Light, but smooth palate, dry, some more coffee in the flavor, grains, and it is done, with a dry finish.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"

Nice kind of cereal-like grain. Big coffee, some vanilla, but still, refreshing despite that, which is impressive. Medium body. Smooth, kind of crisp lighter carbonation. Mild dry in the finish. Good, sort of creamy fullness to the mouthfeel. Moderate to bigger bitter taste, seems like a little added bitterness from the coffee, not that I mind. Light sweet. Just a very mild roasty roughness on the back end. Overall, very tasty. This kind of thing appeals to me. Big coffee, yet refreshing and easy to sip.

Taste follows suit with the coffee and vanilla very nice up front, but the lightness is very erie, yet has a creaminess that smooths the flavors.
