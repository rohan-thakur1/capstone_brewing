3996,"2016-01-23",4.1,"Cela fait maintenant plusieurs années que je déguste cette bière dont je suis témoin dune évolution réfléchie et inspirante. Cette version précise minterpelle particulièrement. Dabord au niveau du look, la bière est aussi irréprochable quelle la toujours été. Un liquide parfaitement noir, une mousse beige onctueuse, crémeuse, dense et collante au verre. Le liquide dans le verre semble dune densité harmonieuse et savamment calculée. En faisant tournoyer le liquide dans mon verre, la pré-mousse se reforme instantanément et ne remonte que très lentement vers la mousse principale. Cette version-ci de la black IIPA me plaît particulièrement car les houblons, bien que bien frais et toujours aussi floraux, sont à mon goût personnel moins agressifs et mieux balancés que dans les versions précédentes de la même bière. Ceux-ci laissent ainsi une place importante aux malts dont la caramélisation apporte tonus, complexité et profondeur à ce liquide mi stout, mi IPA. Je suis exactement au point de jonction de deux styles parfaitement représentés. Texture soyeuse en bouche ou les houblons sexpriment encore une fois avec souplesse. Un paysage de campagne où jardins floraux et champs de céréales renaissent au printemps suite à la fonte des neiges. Longueur plus quagréable et jamais lassante, ce brassin de cette bière est pour moi un franc succès!","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

3996,"2014-11-16",4.3,"I really enjoyed the Dunham Black IPA, so I picked up a sixer of the Imperial Black IPA on faith. Best. Purchase. Ever. Date on the package is Oct. 23, so this stuff is fresh as hell (and it shows).
Overall its basically a turbocharged version of the Black IPA: more malt profile, more hops, more booze. Nose is dark chocolate/cocoa, caramel, molasses with this amazing, fragrant grapefruit/pine/floral hop punch. Taste is a beautiful, heavy, chocolaty imperial stout hopped to the gills, with a big citrus/pine/floral hop finish. Its definitely bitter, but its so wonderfully balanced with the malt that the bitterness isnt overwhelming at all, nor is the malt. (The 8.6% alcohol is beyond unnoticed.) The review below that describes this as 90% dark chocolate with grapefruit is bang on. I think this just became my favourite beer on earth.","Quebec, CANADA","HippyHop"

A tenacious, healthy dark tan foam of great endurance resides above the close to blackness. Tenebrous aroma packed with dark malt flavours, very roasty and particularly chocolatey. Were it not for the unforgiving hops, this would be a fine stout, which is rather rare among black IPAs. The chocolate notes are rich, cakey, filling, yet the hop wave eats it all, its resin-thrower drying out any hint of sweetness, leading to an almost astringent, very bitter finish that lasts on and on. Despite all the malts laudability and surprisingly full palate, this comes across as too brutal and unsubtle for my tastes. The hop profile does indeed showcase some complex green citrusy, earthy notes, but in the end, it all feels a bit purposeless besides for people with a desire for a drink who annihilates the potential for appreciating any other drink on a particular day.

Very dry roasted uber-bitter finish.  I remember loving this beer in small samples at Hivernale Des Brasseurs 2012, but somehow when I had a full serving at Soeurs Grises I thought it was a bit too harsh, even for a hophead-black-ipa-lover like me.  Still pretty good but one glass was enough.  But this is only my opinion expressed in my own words, because I think it is doleful when people try to appear more erudite and apropos by using fancy words like doleful, erudite and apropos.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
3996,"2012-04-18",4.0,"Sample from cask at Winter Warmer 2012.
Appearance : Black with creamy pale brown head.

Aroma : Great citrusy and floral hops. Oily and piny. Roasted malt with some coffee.

Taste : Great oily and resinous hops. Citrusy and piny. Nice roasted malt. Finish oily and juicy hops.

Palate : Nice cask conditioning, really soft and creamy.

Overall : Wow really good. Even better since the cask conditioning was exemplary. Great sharp hops all around well balanced with the roasted malt. Great finish. The regular black IPA is awesome and this one was also pretty good. Id need a full serving to make a fair rating.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

3996,"2012-03-10",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 4, 2013 My Bottom Line:
Dark chocolate-covered almonds move into caramel and conifers in this beautifully expressive Imperial Black IPA.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam laces all around the blackness and its dark brown edges.
-The potent resinous hop bitterness is longlasting. It could have been softer to increase drinkability.
-I love the aromas and flavors that come from this grain bill.
-Almond skin angles are delightful.
-This can be as good as their Lapatt Robust Porter. World-class, in its category.
