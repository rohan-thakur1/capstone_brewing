3179,"2015-03-29",3.1,"Bottle from the Pennsylvania State Store. Rather bland and uninteresting. Nothing outstanding here except the low price.","Pennsylvania, USA","MarkSachon"
3179,"2014-01-25",2.2,"Fu-Ki sake has a clear appearance. The aroma has rice and a faint hint of citrus. Neither come through when I sip, though; its a little bitter, and I dont get much else taste-wise. The palate is medium bodied and flat. Im a bit disappointed.","Valley City, North Dakota, USA","benfergy"
3179,"2013-09-21",2.8,"750ml bottle, shared by robotopera during a sushi party. Bottle is labeled ""Fu-Ki Junmai"". Totally clear and colorless. More of a potent nose. Sweet rice, and rice pudding. Some warmth in the nose. Bigger, wine-like body. No carbonation, totally still. Some bruised fruit in the flavor, alcohol. Sweet taste, and a moderate warmth in the finish. Some green olive, friends say light vinegar. Overall, surprisingly not awful. Sipping it at room temperature from a snifter was totally tolerable. Out of curiosity, we tried mixing some Sapporro into it (to simulate a sake bomb) , it was not good, way better straight.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
3179,"2013-01-03",2.8,"Bottle.  Pours crystal clear.  Has a pleasant aroma with notes of sweet and floral rice.  Smooth flavor and clean finish.","Hamilton Twp., New Jersey, USA","NJBeerman013"
3179,"2012-10-09",4.6,"This is my favorite sake (rice wine), with a sweet, rich flavor and appealing ""rice pudding"" aroma!","Cin. city, Ohio, USA","garrison"
3179,"2011-04-01",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2011 Wonderful Sake. Smells like a rich Nigori, but unfortunately it is clear. Not that big a deal though, tastes like as good a Traditional Sake as there is.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","bpreo"
3179,"2010-10-31",3.2,"(750ml bottle thanks to Mora2000) Just off clear. Smells of alcohol, buttery, just a bit of green apple. Tastes better than it smells- a bit sweeter, more fruit, clean. Nice and fruity.","Texas, USA","zdk9"
3179,"2010-10-06",2.6,"(750ml bottle, courtesy of Mora2000)  Pours a transparent body with excellent legs.  Aroma of plum, rice, sweaty socks, and vanilla.  Flavor of rice, fruit, and alcohol.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
3179,"2010-08-15",3.2,"bottle, thanks to mora2000, clear pour with a blue tint, clean rice and honey dew flavors, aromas of honey dew melon","Dallas, Texas, USA","blutt59"
3179,"2010-08-14",3.4,"(750ml bottle thanks to Mora2000) clear still body, coating is nice but very few alcohol legs. Nose of peach, white flowers, rice, and alcohol. Taste of rice, alcohol, white peach, smooth palate and alcohol in the finish.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
3179,"2010-08-10",3.4,"bottle thanks to mora2000.  poured clear with a light yellow tint and had thick legs.  nose is faint alcohol, florals, vanilla, and almonds.  thick on the palate, flavor is alcohol, vanilla that coats the mouth, and a nutty finish.","Dallas, Texas, USA","mar"
3179,"2010-08-02",2.5,"My first sake of this style. Purchased at Kegs and Barrels in Plano. Pours a very light yellow to clear color. Aroma is alcohol and sugar. The flavor is rice, alcohol and some sweetness.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
3179,"2009-08-17",1.6,"My first sake served hot.  Poured clear.  Definitely get the rice and rubbing alcohol on the nose.  I dont know how to talk about sake but it felt like a smoother not harsh vodka.","Ohio, USA","Pipper"
3179,"2008-07-13",1.7,"Bottle. Pours almost clear. Alcoholy perfumy aroma, very light notes of fruit. Tingly and warming in the mouth, however the flavor is mostly burning alcohol. I drank this at room temperature, which is what the bottle told me to do. It wasn’t very good at all.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
3179,"2008-03-06",1.9,"Nothing special.  Its aromatic, but smells more like alchohol, strong alchohol.  Its appearance is nothing special at all.  Its flavor is strong like kerosene.  Its palate is unpleasant.  Its Sake, curios why this is on the site, but Ive tried it.","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"
3179,"2008-01-05",1.7,"Tastes rather rough and alcoholic. Best served hot to hide the many flaws. Before I tried decent sake in Tokyo, I thought this tasted ok. Now, however, I would only drink it if someone offered it to me in their home (just to be polite).","Washington DC, USA","zebracakes"
3179,"2007-12-13",2.2,"Bottle 750 ml. chilled from Party Town. Poured clear color with little to minimal legs. Moderate green apple aroma. Light body. Light sweet flavor with a light sweet finish with a moderate alcohol burn. Not a lot character.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3179,"2007-11-10",0.8,"UPDATED: JUN 25, 2011 This is not a beer. Tastes like distilled kerosene. Why is distilled sake thought to be a beer on this website? However, there are a few beers that taste worst than this; Jaguar Ice, and clamato.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"
3179,"2007-08-03",2.1,"Picked up single bottle from Cellars Wine & Spirits. Pours a clear water-like sake with no color. Aroma of peppery steamed rice, some pears and a touch of spice. Taste is dry, peppery pear flavor with a dry finish. An average sake at best. I use this sake for most of my Japanese cooking.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
3179,"2007-07-25",1.5,"bottle. pours like water, clear. nose is dusty, rice, and alcohol. flavor is musty, dry, warning, alc. mouth feel is watery. pretty bland with dose of alcohol. not much to like here but it was better cold.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
3179,"2007-04-28",2.2,"Bottle sampled from the local wine and spirits store.i have only had one sake before this, and while iwas in the store purchasing some wine, i figured why not grab a bottle or two for some ratings. Pours clear, the aroma is sweet, alcohol is present. The flavor is alcohol, rice (i guess that is better than corn), and sweet. Not the worst thing i ever had.","Levittown, Pennsylvania, USA","stegosaurus"
3179,"2007-04-13",2.7,"As like many others this is the first sake that Ive tasted and rated, I wasnt quite sure how to rate this since I havent tasted any others, so I guess this will be, more or less, a benchmark, obviously clear in color, sweet aroma with a bit of a leather-like nose, quite light in taste & in body, semi-sweet in flavor with a bit of a big alcohol kick, the kick was especially present in the finish & in the aftertaste, very enjoyable, a nice sake to just sit & sip on for a while","Pottstown, Pennsylvania, USA","obxdude10"
3179,"2007-02-14",2.5,"Completely middle of the road on my rating, because its the first i have had.

Sake pours like water, looks like water, goes down smooth with a touch of sweetness. 

Consumed warm a pleasant sake experience.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","jmikolich"
3179,"2007-01-30",2.7,"Rather mild and watery but still better then other sakes i have had. Aroma was the most intriging part, it seemed to have a slight leathery aspect to it, which seemed complemetray if possible. Alcohol was welll hidden. Itfinshed with a soft sublte sweetness not dry ate all.","New York, USA","crazyvin"
3179,"2006-10-12",2.5,"Id definitely say that this isnt bad sake.  It has a nice aroma, color looks not as purely clear as some sake but it is pretty sweet.  It was pretty good cold but I found it quite enjoyable warm more-so than cold.  One bottle and I was for the most part done as the taste was so sweet that I couldnt bear more than a full sake bottle (mind you I mean sake bottle, not the full bottle it came in).  Very tasty, pretty good... still, it does not stand up to other sake brands that I have tried.  I would call it about average, not too bad but not exceptional either.  If you want sake to drink its fine, if you want sake that is exquisite this is not it.  In other words, its right inbetween.  But dont be afraid to try it.","USA","koihoshi"
3179,"2006-05-22",2.7,"UPDATED: FEB 8, 2007 A semi-sweet/ semi dry. Sake. A tad thin, but has a enough flavor to satify your sake needs.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
3179,"2006-05-22",1.8,"For sake it seems a little sweet. The aroma is nice but the flavor is not great. It does have a rice taste but the palate is a little oily. Not highly recommended.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
3179,"2006-03-23",2.2,"Room temperature.  Clear with a very slight hint of a yellow tint.  Smells of alcohol and rice.  Flavor is the same with a bit of melon flavor in there.  Alcohol is more noticable than in most other sakes Ive tried.  Sweet on the tongue at first, followed by a more rubbing alcohol-like finish.  Mouthfeel is not terrible, but has the sting of alcohol.  Okay, its drinkable, but not very good at all.  In fact, you can buy the Sho Chiku Bai Classic Sake for several dollars cheaper per bottle, and it is higher quality.  Maybe I should try this warm.","Portland, Oregon, USA","BobbyW3363"
3179,"2006-03-13",1.9,"I wish liked this more, since somehow, after a recent meeting of The LoSBD, I ended up with two bottles of this, only one which I purchased. I suspect the second, which I will not be drinking, probably belongs to RAYBOY01.Looks like water, which is admirable in most sakes, I suppose.  Has the aroma of old-lady-cologned grasses and rubbing alcohol.  There is a light, melonish fruit flavor, but mostly it tastes of something to rub into my aching left shoulder, not pour into my gullet.  The finish is quite dry, and the fumes of alcohol leave me in a state of mute nostril agony.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?

3179,"2005-09-27",2.0,"Clear Syrapy Appearance. Aroma of Sterilized Alcohol..Something the Good Ole-Boys Would Conjure Up. Surprisingly The Alcohol Not Noticeable Right Away...Very Light Flavor Overall but Faint Dark Fruit Notes Present...A Bit Stale Aftertaste.  Too Sterile to be Enjoyable.","Minnesota, USA","robertsreality"
3179,"2005-09-09",2.1,"Eh, doesnt taste too good at all. I dont drink it. Still, I buy it often because its good for cooking stir fry.","Bernville, Pennsylvania, USA","MattShizzle"
3179,"2005-07-15",2.1,"Clear color.  The aroma is very reminicent of moonshine from Iowa.  The taste isnt as bad as what I panned on, given the aroma.  Very dry, dark fruit taste, perhaps plum or cherry?  Definite alcohol burn.  Has a bit of a chem lab finish.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
3179,"2005-07-04",1.9,"""A sober man and the sages are both lost through the ages.""Suitably enjoyed while watching Jacky Chans ""Drunken Master"", using Mattas suggested double-boiler technique for warming. Aromas were sweet and alcoholic (medicinally so)... also ricey with a touch of dishwater. Very clear with a hint of ginger-ale coloration and noticably sticky. No head, but I would have been surprised if there was one. More rice in flavor, touch of unidentifiable fruit, with a vodka kick and burn. Its going to take a long time to finish the 750ml bottle.

3179,"2005-06-25",1.6,"Light fruit aromas; plums, with alcohol.  It looks like water. Flavor of alcohol and chemicals.  Thin and rather harsh.  Dry finish.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
3179,"2005-01-30",2.9,"Bottle.  Pours with a very slight tinge of yellow/beige.  Just off clear.  Aroma is somewhat light.  A noticeable alcohol presence in the nose.  Rather smooth but alcohol is noticeable in the taste also.  Really this wasnt as Jet-fuel like as some of the other sakes I have had.  Served cool.","Alabama, USA","11026"
3179,"2005-01-12",2.1,"Clear oily color, light beige. Decents legs and slightly sligh appearance. Nose of light koji and peaches, strong alcohol when warmed. Taste is moderately acidic and green with a bit of alcohol burn in the tounge. Finishes more balanced with some koji-like finish but overall not subtle nor impressive. More of a heating sake. Better than Geikkekan, Ill give it that.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3179,"2004-09-04",0.5,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2008 My first sake, which coincidentally might also be my last one.  Absolutely horrendous.    It poured clear colored and reeking of funky alcohol.  A sip reminded me of bankers club vodka even though it has half the alcohol.  I will never buy this again.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","roder60"
3179,"2003-12-22",2.2,"This was my first Sake thanks to Matta and it was shared among Matta, thedm and myself. No head with fine sized bubbles. The body was uncarbonated and clear. The nose was that of alcohol, sweet and sugary notes. The flavor was sweet, bitter, sour and some fruity notes. The mouthfeel was dry and this Sake burned as it was swallowed. Wow! This was a light bodied Sake with no lacing.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
3179,"2003-12-19",2.7,"TheDM and Hotstuff vacation brew 93.  This bottled sake was sampled in our motel room with Matta in Tampa Florida.  Thanks a lot Matt for our first Sake sampling.  This liquid poured a fully diminished head of medium sized white colored bubbles.  Its crystal clear transparent body contained only waht looked like water.  But, oh what an aroma that water had!  It was very strong with strong notes of alcohol and it reminded me of alcohol soaked bed linen.  It had a mild initial mouthfeel with a burning alcohol finish.  The flavor was like grain alcohol and was very strong.  It gave me the alcohol shivers!","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
3179,"2003-12-13",2.9,"Clear color,light mild fruit aroma.The flavor was only lightly fruity but a definate hit on the alcohol comes throughThe flavor seems to come out more in the end with a light pear like presence and alcohol as well.Kind of thin and watery but maybe thats the way these brews are supposed to be.Not bad i guess but i think i prefered the first one i had.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
3179,"2003-12-13",2.7,"Not much going on with this one. Clear of course with a vanilla and sugar aroma. A slight alcohol burn with a sugary pear and vanilla flavor. Not as complex as the first sake I tried. Ah whatever","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
3179,"2003-12-06",3.1,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2003 Well I mimicked something I watched on “Food Network.”  I took a half full pot of water and warmed it on the stove to about 110 degrees, poured 6oz of sake into a glass measuring cup, placed it into the warm water with the handle hanging over the rim of the pan. I then proceeded to make myself an omelet for breakfast. The sake and egg accompanied one another very nicely.  

 The Fu-Ki pours almost clear, a slight yellow hue can be observed though. The aroma is sweet, sugar or syrup, note of white vinegar, maybe pears. The flavor is similar but I also pick notes of cranberry and white grape, I don’t know what the hell I’m talking about but these are my deductions from my sampling. Finish is sweet and dry; the high abv is slightly noticeable in the nose and finish, possibly a note of rubbing alcohol or vodka. 
 This 750ml bottle cost me just under $12, not a bad price of an expectable sake.  

The sake has far more character when it is warmed to around 100-110 degrees.","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
