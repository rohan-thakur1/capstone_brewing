This bottled Sake from a bottle shop poured a head of frothy fine to large sized white colored bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a strong bubbly carbonation transparent clear colored body and an excellent lacing. The mild aroma was rice. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a bubbly fruity aftertaste. The nice flavor contained notes of rice mildly vinous crisp breads and fruity. Delicious and one I would certainly like to have again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
