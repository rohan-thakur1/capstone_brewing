1633,"2015-08-14",2.0,"So Im going to drink a bottle of saki and operate power tools. Lets hope this goes well.

Bottle. Slightly darker than clear, maybe a tinge yellow.

Smells of well water, glue, light fruit.

Taste is a funky mixture of fingernail polish remover, glue, light fruit, metal.

On second thought, I think Ill switch to beer.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","hershiser2"

1633,"2009-08-29",3.6,"This bottled sake from a restaurant in the Detroit Airport poured no head and a clear slightly yellow hued body.  It was  uncarbonated.  The aroma had very little vinous notes in it.  Atypical of most sakes.  The thin flat mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a mellow vinous alcohol aftertaste. The semi-sweet flavor was dry and mildly vinous. A decent one that I would consider buying again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1633,"2009-07-27",2.8,"1/16/2008:  Gekkeikan Haiku Sake is clear, still, and is a very pale shade of yellow like very pale white wine.  It has pretty thick legs.  The nutty aroma has slight hazelnut undertones and is quite alcoholic.  This sake is slightly sweet and mellow.  It is nutty with a touch of chaulk.  There is some alcohol burn, but it is pretty controlled for being 15% ABV.  It has a medium body and is smooth on the palate.

1633,"2007-01-16",3.1,"2006 bottle consumed on 12/31/2006Almond paste colored (off-white) with short-lived legs left on the glass.  Some fizziness curiously sets up on the edges of the glass, but is also short-lived.Very muted, nutty, heavy aroma.  Not that it seems all that bad to my nose, just not the lighter, more perfumed version.  Sweet coconut, light red apples and a pinch of raw honey seem to all add sweetness without ever becoming aggressively so.  Some light alcohol warming on the end, but it trails off and is folded back in to the nutty-sweet notes.Very nutty flavor mimics the nose.  Boy I suck at rating sakes....but the texture seems round and almost nigori-like.  Not exactly creamy and thick, but soft and more substantial than many other sakes Ive had.  Not that that is necessarily a good thing.  Vanilla, coconut and a touch of alcohol round out the finish.  Bit of paper-like dryness/blandness, but otherwise seemingly pretty clean and inoffensive, with a pleasant, if uncomplex sweetness.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
