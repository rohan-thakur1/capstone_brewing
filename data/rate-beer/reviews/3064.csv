3064,"2017-06-11",4.3,"Light almost clear golden amber color with off white head. Looks delicious. Citrussy and tangerine aroma from the hops I guess, and also some estery fruitiness of apples and pears I think. The malt itself isnt overly present in the aroma but wow it really smells wonderful. The taste is quite sweet and not much bitterness up front but light to medium bitter finish with a little citrussy and grassy hop flavor. All the fruity notes from the aroma can be sensed in the flavor as well. And again not much of the traditional malt flavors especially for a barley wine. It had a fulm body and medium carbonation and a burn from the alcohol can be felt on the palate. I think it is a really great beer. Complex and balanced and quite original in that it is really refreshing in its fresh fruitiness for a barley wine.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Brewhemia"
3064,"2017-06-08",3.7,"From tap at Hair of the Dog, Portland. Aroma is sweet malt, dried fruits, bit candied, ripe fruits, caramel, a touch of hops, with spicy notes. Flavour is rather sweet with a little bitterness in the finish and a boozy liquor touch. Body is full. Sweet and heavy, drinks like a royal shot of spicy liquor. Very nice.","Steenwijk, NETHERLANDS","tricksta_p"
3064,"2017-06-05",3.6,"Batch 95. Hazy, orange/copper color with moderate amounts of suspended sediment; no real head to speak of besides a thin white ring. Subtle aroma of sweetnesscandied stone fruits and citrus marmalades; some toffee & chalky hops mixed in, too. Medium-light body; no carbonation; mild warmth from booze. Arrives with a mixture of caramel, stone fruits, and citrus fruits. Boozy, malty middle with chalky hops toward the end. Finish continues with a lot of bitterness but also has tangerine peels lingering. Give it a couple of minutes in the glass, and the bitterness completely dominates. Solid barleywine but falls short in terms of balance.","California, USA","beer_queue"

It took forever for it to finish pouring the glass and i ended up only getting about 8 oz. out of each of my bottles (2). Other than that it was pretty good. Aroma and flavors of sweet malts, dark fruit, pine and floral notes from the hops. Overall it was nicely balanced, not too sweet or bitter, good complex flavors, and it was easy to drink.

3064,"2016-11-19",4.0,"Köszönet érte Lore-nak! Nem mindennapi főzde palackjára esett a választásom a 700. sörpontozás alkalmával, egy Hair of the Dog levadászása régóta a bakancslistámon szerepelt már. Ennek megfelelően nemigen tudnék rossz véleményt kipréselni magamból Freddel kapcsolatban, de mint ahogy az lenni szokott, ez esetben sem kell kozmetikáznom az értékelésen. Kinézete magával ragadó, opálos és sűrű, élettel telt, narancslekvár-küllem, tojáshéj színű, pöffeszkedő krémhabbal a tetején. Süteménytésztás, marcipánmasszás, grapefruit-dzsemes, vérnarancsos, virágszirmos illatai szambát járnak, az aromás komlók színes együttese húzza a nótájukat. Haraphatóan teltek az ízjegyek, vibrálnak a trópusi gyümölcsös töltelékkel megkent piskótatésztás, marmaládés, diós színezetű, cifra élesztős, kandiscukorral megszórt elemek, melyek egyrészt belga beütésűek, mégis a vérbeli amerikai vonal megtestesítői. Sziporkázó stílusegyveleg, mely majdnem annyira IPA, mint amennyire barley wine, a mázsás súlyú karakter, a szirupos malátafolyam hömpölygése azonban valóban az utóbbi típus stílusjegyeinek irányába mutatnak. Egy ilyen főzet után már csak arra lennék kíváncsi, milyenek lehetnek a Hair of the Dog egyéb, nagynevű alkotásai.","HUNGARY","adster"

Je verse donc la seconde moitié de la bouteille vigoureusement. Rien. Cette bière ne présente vraiment aucune mousse. Enfin. Des arômes riches et amples de pomme rouge compotée, de pâte à tarte,de houblons américains qui ne cherchent pas à envahir le palais mais à balancer cette riche base maltée; mission quils accomplissent avec succès, faut-i le mentionner. Un abricot séché me fait également honneur de sa présence. En bouche, le liquide propose un corps plus quappréciable. Sans être ni trop sucré, mon palais détecte une texture satinée alors que mon oesophage trouve la descente plutôt râpeuse. Cette dernière caractéristique ne provient à mon avis pas du sucre présent, mais plutôt dune amertume surpuissante attribuable à une impressionnante quantité de houblons en début de boil.

3064,"2015-11-22",4.4,"Hair of the Dogs classic barley wine commemorating the late Fred Eckhardt, Portlands influential beer author. Loose, egg-white, irregular head needing some forcing to form but well retaining after that, beautiful deep and pure amber colour, clear with a small flake of protein here and there initially but many more of those with deposit, rendering the beer cloudy dark orange. Powerful and somewhat unusual bouquet of blood orange, grapefruit, mango, freshly toasted bread, watermelon, dried banana, vanilla, pink pepper, white port wine, cider, pear brandy, caramel, chlorine-like hint and even something diary-like (buttermilk - diacetyl?), but in all very agreeable. Candied sweet onset, marmelade, melon, papaja, canned apricot, some sourish berries, citrus peel freshness, expectedly soft carbonation, slick, oily and supple mouthfeel, thick caramel malt sweetness, honeyish, rich with a bitterish toasted edge for balance especially in the finish as well as a certain rye bread-like deep sourishness, where it is accompanied by peppery hops with a brief but unmistakable sharpish American sting and retronasal floral and citrus aromas but quite mildly so yet very complex (unsurprisingly seen the amount of hop varieties used), as well as the expected glow of white rhum-like alcohol, becoming just a little bit wry in the end but not disturbingly so especially considering this particular beer style. The big caramel malt sweetness triumphs in the end but remains well balanced by the bittering hops.  Delicious sipper with certain Belgian traits, mostly sweet but in an elegant, seductive manner and well-balanced with bitterish hop and toasted notes.

Taste, initially, is moderate sweetness with caramelized sugar and dried fruit notes. On the finish there is a citrus hop flavor, rye spiciness, and alcohol.

Hazy oranges under a thick puffy white head which takes its time fading into a solid layer of white fluff, tightly packed white fluff that is. Swirls thick and lacy.

Nose:
Yeasty, doughy, spicy, and boozy. Apricots, peaches, and pineapples  dried and delicious. Green banana peel and aloe. Soft brushed saddlebags and chamois. Starfruit and papaya. Angel food cake soaked in all the above.

Palate:
Sweet and bready and chamois and bananas and nutty. Moist banana nut bread. Candied pineapple and apricot and apple. Cumin and saffron. Candied ginger in the back. Gentle warmth settles into the chest. Flambéed tropical undertones. A touch of angel food cake to soak up all the goodness.

Final Thoughts:
A sophisticated brew from a tongue in cheek brewery whose beers are anything but tongue in cheek. Hair of the Dog beers are hard to come by so should you ever be so lucky, enjoy. I know I did.

3064,"2013-05-25",3.8,"Poured into a perfect pint. Batch 83.

3.5 A: I needed a few pours to get a full glass due to the massive head. Anyway, I eventually got to a well hazed orange brown color with a lot of small particulate floating about. Three fingers of frothy/foamy beige head. Retention is impressive given the ABV and a ton of lacing is left.

4.5 S: Quite a nice nose on this. Quite malty like most HOTD brews. Deep caramel, toffee, light fruits, spicy earthy rye, and some raisin and fig. Candi sugar for that extra push of sweetness. Hops are floral, citrusy, and herbal. Solid, robust aroma on this.

4.0 T: Taste is like the nose, but just isnt quite as impressive. That said, its still damn good. Lots of caramel, generic light fruitiness, dates and raisins, spicy earthy rye. Again that trademark candi sugar residue. Mild bitterness, but much more hop flavor. Citrusy, then floral, then herbal, then citrusy again.

4.0 M: Heavier body. Good moderate carbonation despite needing several pours. Good creaminess and plenty smooth. Alcohol is hard to detect.

4.5 D: This might be my favorite HOTD brew. Very nice balance and super easy to drink. Well done.

3064,"2013-05-12",3.7,"Bottle courtesy of Porcelainbomb (reddit trader). Pours dark orange and gold with zero carbonation. Aromas are sweet sugary goodness, apricot, caramel and soap. Flavors are big sweet candy, then alcohol both burn and flavor, then something that tastes akin to carrot juice and finally some intense hop bitterness. Palate is very heavy in weight but a little thin and hot, it would benefit from some carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer though it is hard to wrap my head around all the flavors and feelings this is trying to convey to the drinker; it is a little too broad in flavor which causes it to become muddled. Still above average due to its scope and the fact that not many brewers would take this kind of a chance.","Chandler, Arizona, USA","AZBennett"

Poured amber and more-or-less clear.  Although bottle conditioned, the aromatics seem similar to a barrel-aged beer.  Some of that is the suggestion of brandy in this high ABV ale. Also smells a little fruity. Has a medium-full body with some harshness from the alcohol.
Taste: very strong flavor; no style on bottle but ""imperial barleywine"" seems appropriate.  Mildly bitter. 

O: an extreme ale that seems a little over the top and with the high ABV a bit too obvious.  Rough and unrefined in contrast with an aged Firestone DBA that preceded it.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"

Flavor is very smooth with a lot of residual sweetness. The rye lends a strong character to this brew and melds well with the citrus, grassy and pine hops character of the beer. Body is hefty with a low amount of carbonation that really makes it feel sugary and thick. Overall a very good brew. The age is starting to creep a bit into the flavor. Sweetness is a bit much for me but doesnt detract from the flavor as the rye spice and very light smoke help to take the edge off of it.

Poured from 12oz. bottle into Founders snifter.

A: Holy head Batman! I poured extremely slowly because Ive heard about the carbonation issues with HotD brews. Even with this slow tilted pour it produced a 3 finger head that rose slowly to a 4 finger head. It poured a nice dark apricot with yellowed edges. The bubbles flying around underneath the head are crazy. The retention is otherworldly and the lace is thick and heavy along the class.

S: Trying to fight through the head for smells is tough, but Im picking up some nice caramel malts and some toffee. Some nice dark fruits, plums and dates, with a boozy back.

T: What a mix of flavors. The dark toffee and caramel malts are extremely present up front, then give way to those dark fruits I smelled earlier. The heat is more present in the taste and leaves a little trail down the throat. Some smooth bitterness finishes out the beer.

M: Very oily and creamy. Medium bodied. Leaves an oily film that coats the mouth with a nice mild sweetness. The carbonation is present, but not as prickly as I would have imagined.

O: Waiting for the head to die down was worth it. A very good brew. I really enjoyed the mouthfeel and the tastes and smell really blended nicely.

3064,"2012-07-27",3.7,"Im enjoying this beer tonight by the generosity of drabmuh. Thanks a lot Matt!

A: Fred appears very similar in color to a glass of cherry juice. The beer is pretty hazy. There is about an inch of thick, off-white head that slowly shrinks down to 1/4"" and holds steady. Ample lacing can be found around the circumference of the tulip glass.

S: The aroma is quite strong and forward. Sweet malts and alcohol take the lead, followed by some underlying fruit scents.

T: Chewy caramels soaked in alcohol. The heat and/or alcohol are really quite prominent in all aspects of this beer. That being said, I dont find it as bothersome as I usually do. Perhaps its because this is a seriously well crafted beer. All in all, I do feel that the alcoholic intensity prevents this from achieving a higher flavor score, as it really dominates the overall presentation in the nose and palate. A few years (or more) in the cellar could very possibly yield a top-notch American Barleywine. Hmm...

M: Thick and heavy, the liquid creates a warming sensation that starts in your throat and runs down into your chest, similar to a shot of whiskey. If I were outside freezing, and really craving a beer, Fred would be a great choice.

D: I imagine that this beer would have no problem hibernating in my cellar until my son is ready to drink it (hes three). That being said, I thought it was really tasty and enjoyable now, though it packs a punch. This is a great brew to share with some friends, as a few ounces in a snifter would be adequate.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

Poured a hazy golden-copper color with a head that stood a little less than a finger tall. Foam is off-white and has now settled a thin layer. Pretty good retention. Good amount of carbonation bubbles sticking to the inside wall of the glass.

The aroma is big and malty with a good amount of sweetness. Im also getting a bit of butterscotch.

Big malty body up front followed by an ever bigger sweetness! It almost reminds me a bit of maple syrup. Thankfully, theres a bit of bitterness as this one nears the back end of the palate. Thick and flavorful finish.

Full bodied syrupy mouthfeel. It looks carbonation heavy, but its actually got a very light carbonation.

Clear brown/orange with no head at all. I try a vigorous pour but still no head.

3064,"2011-10-16",4.8,"12 oz bottle. Batch # 82. My golly this beer has a huge head. Giant, white, pillowy, and lacy--hangs around forever. After it recedes a bit, it looks like an ice cream float. Has a golden hue with a light haze. Aroma is fruity. It doesnt have an overripe fruit nose like a lot of barleywines have, though. Its more appetizing than that. Has a bit of a Belgian funk going on. Its also a little bready. Taste is like liquid candy skating across the tongue before a wave of bitterness comes along to balance things out. Alcohol is very noticeable, but its not detrimental to the overall effect of the beer. Tastes nothing like any barleywine Ive ever had. It tastes like a lot of imperial pilsners out there (yes, I know its an ale). I think its its own beast--a completely unique beer not chained down to any one particular style. The body on this thing is huge; has a creamy mouthfeel and medium-soft carbonation. Lip-smacking good. One of the best beers Ive ever had, hands down.

The aroma is pretty funky and tart, does this have brett in it? I also detect sweet grapefruit and candy sugar in the aroma. The taste is at first very Belgian, yeast, sugary, but after the swallow the hops take hold, very bitter and piney, unique beer. The alcohol is a little more present than I would like, It kind of leaves a burn on the tongue. Body is thick, carbonation is high. Overall I really liked this beer, unique, is it a Belgian ale, is it a barleywine, is it an American strong ale, I think you could classify this as any one of them. The aroma I did like slightly better than the taste, just because of the alcohol presence, but I couldnt quite give it a 7 in the taste department, I wish I could have given it a 7.5. Halfway through my totally changes on the flavor, the alcohol although still present, has mellowed, and this beer just gets more complex as it warms, I am going to raise my overall from a 16 to an 18, great beer!","Idaho, USA","Beerdrinker79"

3064,"2011-09-10",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2014 Pours a light amber; lighter than I would expect for such a big beer. Overwhelming character is sweet malt with ripe banana and some peach flavor, very well balanced with bitterness, which is needed for such a sweet beer. I like this, but it is thick and sweet, so half a bottle is about right for me. A good aging candidate simply because there is so much flavor here that a few years or more could mellow it an make it even more interesting and drinkable.

Update 11/2012: Sampled a bottle that spent about nearly 2 years in my cellar. Now a much different beer. Both the sweetness and the hop bitterness are down. No longer what I would call an over the top beer. Although not terribly interesting and not very complex, it also is not a simple, sweet brew. Taste reminds of of sweet peaches, with just about the right amount of hop bitterness. Whereas I was previously not interested in cellaring more of this, I think I now will.

UPDATE 5/2014: Bottle at 3 years. Pour medium golden, big, lasting head. Mild aroma of malt and background of hops; not very interesting. Flavor is still sweet malt with some balancing hop bitterness. Pretty balanced. Moderately complex. Has subtle ripe fruit notes.

3064,"2011-09-05",2.7,"Drank at the tasting room. Okay lets be honest... for a 10% ABV in a Belgian golden I expect the candi sugar to dominate, drying out the pallet and turning a strong beer into a lighter beer with a slight malt background and a yeast flavor to dominate the flavor. All that I could think about by drinking this beer was how thick and heavy it is. If I drank this through a straw it would take effort to suck it through the straw. This is not an easy to drink beer. Yes the flavors are very complex and nice, but it takes effort to finish the gorgeous tulip glass it came in. My friend agreed, and then the couple to my side also agreed, offering us some of their beer if we would like it.

3064,"2011-08-10",4.5,"Bottle, 
this beer had a clear copper (orange & red) pour with a ton of lively carbonation that made a huge head of faint off-white bubbles that filled the large tulip glass and was well preserved (cover filled the glass and stayed that way), it was fluffy, and left lots of lacing on the glass as I drank, the glass had some haze but I could see lots of streaming bubbles, there was a dark layer of sediment that covered the bottom of the bottled, 

the aromas were light and dark fruit - light and dark raisin with prune and floral hops, light caramel, some bread malt, and brown sugar sweetness on the nose (letting this beer warm up opened up the aromas), 

there were flavors of light and dark dried fruit  raisin and prune, faint caramel, molasses and brown sugar sweetness in this beer, 
the hops gave a good bitterness that complements the sweetness, and there was some sourness on the palate that gave balance to this drink, 

the mouth feel was thicker than medium but felt light for a 10% alc. beer, this was nice on the palate, there was a touch of alcohol warmth on the palate, 

this beer did not feel like a 10.0% alc., and had the best presentation I have ever experienced with a Barley Wine style beer,

3064,"2011-05-24",3.6,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass (leaving most of the yeast in the bottle).Appearance: Beautiful shade of dark amber/orange. Definitely hazy. Forms a surprisingly large, white, frothy head which retains and laces very well for such a potent beer.Smell: Non-citrus tropical fruits, flowers and Fruity Pebbles cereal. Very light and perfumey.Taste: I wasnt sure what to expect with this beer. The bottle describes it as a ""special golden ale"" which lead to believe it would be something like a Duvel, only stronger. As soon as it hit my palate I knew it definitely wasnt in the Belgian strong pale ale category. Fred is like drinking thinner, carbonated honey. It is extremely sweet with notes of vanilla, spiced rum, and plenty of hops. It begins with noticeable bitterness, but nothing too absurd. The middle and second half are rich and sweet like syrup and honey and the finish contains a strong alcoholic presence. Between the rich sweetness and bitterness, this beer definitely lingers and dries out the palate. Fred is definitely a very robust beer, but its not a delicious one. Sure, the sweetness is appealing, but its cloying, especially as it warms. An acquired taste this beer is.Mouthfeel: Thick, soft, and sticky with a strong aftertaste of dry bitterness and syrupy sweetness.Drinkability: Straight out of the fridge, this beer isnt exactly quaffable, nor is it a sipper. Its right there in the middle. As it warms and the palate begins to wear down the taste buds and it does becoming difficult to drink in more than a sip at a time. The 10% ABV is very prominent in both the taste and the potency. Overall, a strange beer, but a good one. Not what I would consider a barley wine (as classified by Rate Beer and Beer Advocate), but its hard to peg it down as anything else. I liked it, but one is good enough for me.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Served in a snifter. The initial pour is a moderately-dark dark with a bit of a reddish hue. The nose is quite nice, bringing forward some green apples, light hops, caramel, spice, and a bit of general malty sweetness.

The taste mimics the nose to a large extent, though some of the darker, more fruity flavors take over just a bit. Mild green apple skin the background. Nice touch of caramel and light brown sugar. Good feel with a nice body and a hint of booze in the finish. Drinks quite well and is another solid brew from a brewery that just cant seem to miss.

APPEARANCE:

Pours hazy, burnt orange gold. Some sparse cinnamon powder-like sediment. Off-white, cream-colored head is 1 finger and settles fairly quickly, leaving a thin film of foam on surface as well as some medium size bubbles around edge of glass. 


AROMA:

Tangy aroma that has some subtle vinous character  almost like smelling a WarHeads (sour hard candy). Strong rye aroma. Spices  allspice as well as light cinnamon and nutmeg. Hops, which seem citrusy and grassy. Belgian candi. Some honey. Grape bubblegum. Wet grain. Extremely faint band-aid.

Slightly musty character to the aroma as well  though this seems to fade as the beer warms up. 

As it warms up, displays some oak notes. Subtle orange creamsicle aroma as well. 

TASTE: Belgian candi. Rye. Tang from the rye. Hops are citrusy and grassy. Spices such as allspice, as well as some light cinnamon and nutmeg. Some honey. Faint orange creamsicle. 

Back of palate has slight grainy taste. Finish has hop bitterness, including light resinous characteristics. Light alcohol warmth on finish. 


MOUTH FEEL: Thick; almost a bit syrupy. Full-bodied. Definitely quite sweet, though unable to say it is cloying - as long as it is drunk as a dessert beer. Mid to low carbonation. 


OVERALL: Sweet  definitely a dessert beer. Despite being primarily sweet, there is slight bitterness on the finish. Seems like plenty of residual Belgian candi  whether this is good or bad will depend on the mood/environment of the drinker. Let it warm up a bit and take your time with this slow-sipper. Despite some faint off notes among the complexities on the nose, the positive attributes of the overall experience with this beer far outweigh any marginally undesirable notes on the aroma. Complex interplay of sweet and slightly tangy with a bit of a bitter finish. Interesting and quite unique.","San Diego, California, USA","AHTOH"

Aroma:Tons of sweet malt, dark fruits, and alcohol in the aroma.

Taste:The hops are very much in force in this beer on the foretaste, hugely bitter. The midtaste lets the malt and caramel flavors start to shine through the bitterness. The aftertaste mellows out nicely leaving caramel and dark fruit flavors on my tongue.

Palate:This beer has a medium to heavy body, great carbonation, a little creaminess, and some hot alcohol. The heavy handed hops give it some harsh astringency.

The body is full with average carbonation and a super long finish that starts off with sweet caramel and vanilla, a bit of burnt toffee, and then bitterness.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"

This one has some age on it, but still get a nice pillowy slightly off-white head on a light coppery brown color...very opaque.  Some light hoppiness still remains in the aroma, but very slight citrus.  Apples, caramel and light toffee in the aroma.  Candy, apples, caramel, and a bit of earthy wood feature in the flavor.  Medium body and a little oily with sparkly carbonation.  Very warming, and an obvious sipper.  Would like to try a fresh one for comparison, but still a nice enough one with some age on it.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","Nickls"
3064,"2011-01-07",4.3,"Bottle, Batch #80, c/o SuzyGreenberg.  Pours dark golden orange, slightly hazy with some tan-colored sediment, and topped by a thick, creamy 2-finger beige head made of barely-discernable bubbles.  The head recedes slowly to leave a thin white veil of lacing.  The aromas are sweet plum, cherry, raisin, brown sugar, pine and spruce, a touch of sour orange and alcohol, citrus rind, and caramel.  The flavor is plum, cherry, sugar-coated orange, and candi sugar, moving to slightly bitter pine and sweet fruity malt.  The finish introduces mildly funky fruit and leather.  This is deliciously sweet.  Medium carbonation makes this smooth and creamy, with a sweet, sticky mouthfeel, and a warming finish.  Very drinkable.  Absolutely amazing; I need more.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","Boliv"

An aroma of grapefruit and hops emanates from the glass, hopefully the taste is a little more distinct than the smell since there is not much going on. This brew is different when compared to the other barley wines on one key aspect - hops. It is not nearly as hoppy as the other two or three Ive had recently and is dominated by fruit instead of bitterness. If you arent a fan of hops I would give this a try if you want to have any kind of barley wine.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Dfonorow"

How appropriate that it was just before Fred Fest!   Colour... slightly cloudy orange-brown with a thin head. Nose... boiled fruity sweets, dates, raisins, and golden sirop. Palate... moderately frothy with loads of golden raisins, dried cherries, quercus, vanillin, zante currants, macerated Bing cherry skins, medjool dates, clover honey, Scottish heather, Christmas spice and a extraordinarily long, coating finish.

The flavor is very sweet, which I dont particularly like, but it works alright with this beer.  The flavor is BIG and the booze is most certainly present.Very warming on the mouth and stomach.  Mostly fruit notes with hints of molasses, vanilla, wood, and more.  Full bodied with minimal carbonation.  Overall: this is undeniably good, but 8 ounces would suffice.  This one is not for the faint of heart, or the genuinely thirsty.

They have a very limited number of bottles but had sold some before I got mine.  She said that yes, thats what theyd seen in previous bottles sold.  It smells of woody malts and plenty of hops.  The flavor is heavily hopped with malt, some oak notes, and obvious candi sugar.  The candi sugar in a barley wine didnt work well for me, but the other flavors were good.

A moderately aggressive pour into my Duvel tulip produced a cloudy, medium copper-brown beer with a thick, airy, bubbly head. 

After swirling this one around, I detected a slight cardboard smell, which was quickly replaced by aromas of apricots, canned peaches and pineapple.

The fruitiness translated to the taste on this one as well, picking up some citrus notes (orange?) which went nicely with the very present and warming alcohol flavors.

On the finish, this one was still a bit hot, and I seemed to detect a few off notes that I could not put my finger on (due to the shipping, perhaps?). Finished warming, with somewhat of a harsh bitterness. Overall an enjoyable beer, but does not live up to the expectations that I set for it.",", Colorado, USA","emmasdad"

Fairly big alcohol finish. Carbonation is pretty fizzy, way more than I like in a beer this big. Perhaps the bottle is infected? Not sure. Didnt like this all that much. Hot, and not really all that pleasant.","Årnes, NORWAY","Kestral"

We tried it side-by-side with Fred from the Wood.  Aroma of sweet malt, honey, caramel, raisin, hops, brown sugar, and alcohol.  The flavor followed suit nicely, with notes of maple in addition to the above.  Medium-full bodied, with warming alcohol.  This is a nice barley wine, and like Shawn pointed out, like a toned-down version of FFTW, so it makes sense that this is the base beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

3064,"2009-11-02",3.9,"Golden amber with a shy off-white and very bubbly head that settles kind of fast. Minimal lacings.

The smell is of caramel, candy and a hint of fudge. Lots of floral and grassy hop notes mixed with a doze of yeast (like white bread). Estery with notes of strawberries and tart berries and lemons. A hint of alcohol. The smell is rather hard to nail down and every breath seems to reveal different prominent characteristics - truly complex and enticing. All in all, a really good and interesting smell.

Lots of sweetness going on in the taste, the flavor is almost sugary. A lovely malt character with notes of mostly caramel, but also fudge. A gentle taste of candy ends the sweetness as a light fruity yeastiness and wood take over. The hops, although they have clearly starting to fade in this one, gather momentum and balance the sweetness nicely. Other than a general floral character, its hard to pick out any elements derived from the hops. Perhaps I get a hint of lemon. The finish is pleasantly bitter with complementary malty sweetness, spices and herbal alcohol.

Full-bodied and oh so smooth. The slick mouthfeel is just outstanding with a nice sticky finish. The only thing holding it back from a perfect five is a slightly too gentle carbonation.

A very good beer, definitely a sipper considering the sweetness, the comparatively prominent taste of alcohol in the finish and the smooth mouthfeel.

3064,"2009-10-27",4.3,"Batch 73.  Bottle from scrizz.  This pours out really thick, a golden-amber color and a huge khacki head with a ton of it staying on top.  Gobs of lacing left on the glass.  The aroma shows piney hops, caramel, toffee, dark fruits and a strong maple scent.  Theres also a floral presence in the nose that quickly takes a back seat.  The flavors are all over the place.  This requires more than a few sips to rate.  At first I didnt think it was overly complex but theres so much more to this the further I work through the bottle.  On one hand, the flavors are rather hoppy with spiciness and a fruity zest.  Then the next sip will be quite sugary showing lots of brown sugar and maple with some plum character and even molasses.  Theres just a lot going on and overall theres the right amount of bitter hops to counter the sweet flavors.  A great beer.  Thanks Clint!

It pours with a golden color and a giant, fluffy, whipped cream like head. It smells like beer candy. Caramel, toffee and light, dry pilsner malts show through nicely in the aroma. The two finger head has hardly diminished at all after a few minutes. The taste is amazing, with sweet caramel, butterscotch, rum, and a complex spicy character. A very interesting combination of Belgian, pilsner, and American hoppy beers. It works well for me. It finishes with a dry, bitterness. Great beer .
Batch 87 (most recent batch, within a year of bottling) tasted on 1/18/13. The cap pops fiercely and it pours almost like an infected bottle. Tons of foam and not much beer. It has an orange/copper color with an off white head. The foam sticks around forever but slowly subsides after a while. The aroma is decidedly fruity with a lot of rye malt. Orange, grapefruit, pineapple, peach and rye spice stand out. Dried pineapple slices, big time. The flavor is very strong with fruit, rye and bitterness. The body is full and the carbonation is perfect. Powerful and tasty. 4.0   ..
Batch 84 tasted on 1/18/13 side by side with the newer vintage detailed above. It pours the same orange/copper color, only the head is much more reasonable. Nice and thick/lasting, but it doesnt overwhelm the beer. The aroma is outstanding. Dried apricots, pineapple, juicy peaches, a touch of brown sugar with a wonderful sweet toffee and caramel background. Maybe a bit of nutty oxidation, but it serves this beer well. The flavor is much more of a barleywine than the newer vintage. Medium to low carbonation with lots of toffee, caramel and a bit of sherry with apricots, peaches, pineapple, etc The main difference between this and the newer bottle is the malt complexity comes to the foreground melding beautifully with the fruity hop profile.

3064,"2009-07-27",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 28, 2009 Vertical tasting with csbosox of Batch 49 (shared by csbosox, bottled 19-June-03), Batch 67 (purchased at Bottleworks in Seattle, bottled 26-Sept-07), and Batch 70 (purchased at Bottleworks in Seattle, bottled 1-March-08).  Thanks for the information Alan!
Appearance:
Batch 49 - hazed ruby orange, small off white head that falls quick. Cloudiest of the three.
Batch 67 - slight haze ruby orange, visible fine carbonation intermittently floats up. One inch white head falls with some lacing.
Batch 70 - golden orange, mostly clear. One inch white head falls quick. Nice lacing.

Aroma:
Batch 49 - toffee, dark dried fruit, some lighter peppery yeast. Currants. Really soft and enveloping. Beautiful.
Batch 67 - caramel toffee, soft apple fruit, straw and hay. Much milder aroma than the 49. Nice, just not as much personality as 49.
Batch 70 - citrus fruit, some bright caramel honey sweetness. Noticeable alcohol heat. This smelled noticeably younger than the others.

Flavor:
Batch 49 - really full and developed caramel toffee, followed by an earthy spice type flavor that was maybe the rye, hard to pin down.  Finish is the currants and dried fruits. Finish lingers a bit and gets some dirty earthiness in it. Oxidation is evident, but melds really nicely.
Batch 67 - toffee, same rye character as 49, woody, organic, mineral, spice black pepper in the end. Alcohol mildly evident way in the back.
Batch 70 - bright citrus and caramel maltiness, the woody resiney rye is behind that. Very evident heat.  As with the nose, it was remarkable how much younger this tasted than the 67.

Palate:
Batch 49 - mostly flat. Medium to heavy body, coats mouth perfectly with a nice lingering sweetness.
Batch 67 - mostly flat. Soft and velvety, medium to slight heavy body. Lingering heat in the finish.
Batch 70 - mostly flat. Much thinner than the others, bright alcohol heat in the finish.

Overall:
Batch 49 - really nice, very much in that zone of aged sweetness and melded oxidation that I like my Barley Wines.
Batch 67 - had some of the characteristics of the 49 that I liked, as well as some of the characteristics of the 70 that I did not.  Still nice, but not to the level of the 49.
Batch 70 - disjointed and weirdly hot.  Still an interesting enough beer, but really came into its own with age.

Final Notes:
It was very interesting to see the progression of time with this beer.  It certainly improved with age, which has become increasingly rare for me with aged beers.  Thanks again for sharing the Batch 49 with me Chris, it really made this tasting.

Rerate from a fresh bottle. Gushing bottle, hugely carbonated. Golden color, aroma has lots of hops, but is dominated by sweet malt and candi sugar, and quite a bit of alcohol.

It has a strong, sweet, malty aroma with notes of tropical fruit-- maybe passion fruit. Its medium-full bodied and fluffy. It leaves the tongue sticky. Its very full flavored! Its slightly sweet, quite phenolic and very complex with notes of chocolate, caramel, leather and whiskey. Its pretty shocking, actually. This is good stuff, but finishing a twelve-ounce bottle is kind of a challenge.","Fairport, New York, USA","yesyouam"
3064,"2009-06-24",3.8,"Bottle, from Lone Hill Liquors in CA.  Sits dark orange with a huge head of fine pearly carbonation.  Aroma has a bunch of candi sugar and bubble gum upfront, along with some pear, nutmeg and lemon.  Really interesting . . . is the yeast contributing to the complexity of the aroma?  Flavor has strong grass and dried fruit, followed by herbs, and sugar sweetness.  Palate is quite light for the ABV, with a notably prickly mouthfeel from the aggressive carbonation.  Finishes spicy, with a long warming quality.  Leaves a syrupy residue in your mouth.  Overall, Fred is definitely worth a try.  It is a Belgian ale with all-American ingredients, and demands to be contemplated as such.  I enjoyed this as a drink, appreciated the complexity of flavor, but was underwhelmed mostly due to Freds unruly carbonation.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"

It is a deep, cloudy orange with a huge rocky off-white head. Aroma is light hops, light citrus, floral notes, and light brown sugar.  Flavor is black pepper and hops up front. Then melds into citrus hops, grapefruit and slight alcohol burn.  I like this, it reminds me of one of my all time favorites (De Dolle Arabier) but with all the flavors intensified and with a fuller body.  Much less sweet and more effervescent than the from the wood. A bit easier to drink as well.  The From the wood is more of a sipper for me.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"

Once you devour a lot of foam, you can actually taste it; It is very DIPA-ish; bitter hops, sweet fruit, flora, and then bitter again at the end. Very different from your average barleywine. Again, tastes like a Double IPA. No matter what its classified as, its pretty good. Palate is a little sticky, a little carbonated, not too special.

In fact, while I was waiting for the head in the glass to settle the head in the bottle continued to rise and spill onto the table.  Still looks great though, oranged copper, proud white head just a shade toward tan.  Strong milk caramel aroma, sanded down with wood before it gets abrasive.  Still strong with the alcohol.

Looks like whipped cream on a milkshake.  It eventually faded back to a singular, off-white puff that floated in the center of my glass for the duration. Pours a darkened, hazy shade of blood-orange and copper.   I expected more from the nose on this one.  Malt, brown sugar, pine sap, macerated pineapples, oranges, and peaches.  There are slight tinges of alcohol running around but for the most part the nose is subdued.  Flavor is more of the same but the candy sugar and brown sugar seems to stand out the most.

Pours a deep, clear amber which shines bright orange when held up to light.  The head is very small, off-white and hangs around for a bit as a collar with good lacing.

The aroma is big on caramel malts but with plenty of floral and grassy hops in the nose as well.  There is also a musty fruit sweetness that mixes with the booze with a bready character throughout.

The taste follows the aroma and has a generous caramel and bready malt backbone with lots of alcohol soaked fruit.  There is more of an earthy hop presence in the taste as opposed to citrus hops.  The finish definitely has the hop bitterness I was expecting.

The mouthfeel is sticky sweet with less than moderate carbonation, leaving the palate coated with the tastes.

Not as thick as I would like. Very alcoholic/hoppy/malty. The carbonation destroys the palate, if you ask me. This beer is nice, but overrated. I do not know.

Very sweet juicy aroma, pineapple and brown sugar, alcohol, some creamy butter, light toffee, light marshmallow, candied rye malt and some other tropical fruits.  First taste is quite sugary, slightly burnt toffee, very rich, toasted marshmallows, light pineapple, light caramelized brown sugar, lots of honey, the floral hops are beginning to oxidize.  I remember Fred from the Wood being so much juicier and having a lot more pineapple.  This seems to have more burnt toastiness and more transparent alcohol.   The rye malt is quite evident in the finish, adds a nice spicy kick.  The palate is pretty spectacular though, syrupy but carbonated by lots of very tiny fine sparkling bubbles.

3064,"2008-11-18",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 1, 2009 On tap at Stone.  Not much aroma. No head at all.  Light lace at most.  Interesting dynamic in the mouth.  It was sweet and full in the mouth, but with a LIGHT flavor to it.  At the same time it was also fruity and thick.  Im not sure how I could get all those sensations at once.  I could definitely taste the alcohol.  Fruity, with a bitter bite at the end.  Tastes of wine, apple, and aspirin. Wasnt a 99 percentile to me unfortunately.
Rerate from 12 oz bottle batch 73.  Total gusher.  Lost a few oz. after I poured it.  Still 3 inches of SOLID, walk-on-it head a couple of minutes later.  As I eat the head with a spoon its super sweet and malty.  Creamy sweet to alcohol hot to bitter hops.  Then gooey thick.

Rich sediment flows from the bottle.  The off white head dissipates quickly.  Aroma is sweet with some honey and citrus, hops are earthy and  a woody aroma is detectable as well.  First mouthful reveals a lot of what was in the aroma.  Woody, hoppy and sweet.  Creamy mouthfeel is interesting.

Taste is superb - balanced from beginning to end, but ever changing. Starts off with a toffee sweetness, some citrus, and dry, spicy alcohol that never turns boozey, all the while with a restrained hop bitterness sitting underneath the flavors without truly emerging. As the flavor progresses, the alcohol comes out a bit more, with the hops poking through on the palate just long enough to leave a restrained bitterness to counter the sweet, over-ripe golden fruit and rich toffee that also assert themselves towards the finish. A bit of alcohol bite contributes to the dryness of the tail end of the finish, along with just a bit of spicy yeast presence.

Head is small, creamy, slightly off-white, with virtually no lacing, but it did coat the glass quite well. Color is hazy orange. Flavor starts moderately sweet and acidic, then finishes lightly sweet and moderately acidic and bitter. Palate is medium to full, oily, and has a soft carbonation. It finishes moderately astringent and sticky. Bold aromas and flavors set this beer apart from most other Barly wines.

3064,"2008-07-30",4.3,"Pours a lightly hazy dark orange amber.  A massive, foamy, tan colored head settles to a small blanket, with thick patches of organic looking lace coating the glass well.  The aroma shows huge brown sugar notes up front, followed by waves of caramel, cream, hazelnuts, and pancakes drizzled with fresh maple syrup.  Vanilla is consistently present in the background of the nose, and some notes of rye and citrus blossoms move in on the back end as well.  Flavors move from sweet and sugary to citrus hoppy and back again in a seamless transition.  The brown sugar, vanilla, and nut components are so prominent, its almost like they started with a brownie recipe and decided to brew a beer instead.  Pancakes come to mind again, as does German chocolate cake icing.  The spicy citrus hops provide just the right amount of bite to even things out.  Nearly full bodied, with a creamy palate, it drinks heavy and definitely makes for a slow sipper.  This beer is just fantastic.

There is also some pepper at this point, along with some light oxidation, and a substantial amount of citrus as well.  This is quite complex.  Taste is sweet caramel, candi sugar, which yields to a fruity (pineapple, tangerine) and spicy hop finish that lingers quite nicely, even though this beer is aged.

3064,"2008-04-05",4.0,"Bottle, Batch 59.  Saccharine aroma with undertones of floral hops and heavy Duvelish yeast.  A hard stone, though: clear but non-boozy alcohol, heavy, gritty caramel, and a massively, massively complex hop mix - a little hard to figure out whats gone into this, but I relish the attempt.   Pine and citrus with a lot of must, wood, raisins, etc.  Light pepper and spice.  Deep dark amber pour with a firm, frothy, rocky tan head.    Taste balances bitter and sweet, hard to tell which is winning at any given time, they tumble and roll as a surging tide.  Full, viscous, sticky body, obese with layers of malt.  Loads of hops with prominent - but not quite burning - alcohol, woody yeast leading furtively to a dry, bitterish end.  Dark toffee and a muddled background of fruit (orange rind and hidden lemon).  Earthy, herbal currents blend with yeast and remind of an overly-hopped saison.  Honey-golden sunshine.  Thick and heavy and much worthier of the name Kong than FFFs offering - a true, top-shelf sipper.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

4/02/2008:  Fred Golden Specialty Ale (Bottles Conditioned) has a really nice deep honey color and is alive with carbonation.  The foamy beige head stays around for quite some time as the bubbles keep chruning their way to the surface.  The aroma is sweet and fruity with a good amount of rich maltiness as well as a touch of rye-like spiciness.  I am encouraged by the lack of blatent hoppiness in the aroma.  This beer really smells wonderful and has aged and developed nicely based on what my nose is picking up!  Wow, the flavor is great as well.  The aroma did not let me down.  The flavor begins sweet and sticky with the caramel maltiness coming through.  Then it gets more fruity (nuances of caramleized pineapple, some apricot, candied and aged orangy citrus, and similar) and spicy with a bit of an edge to it like a Belgian Triple might have.  A dry and spicy rye character is quite pronounced in the finish and it blends so well with the citrus rind and resiny hop flavors and bitterness that emerge.  The alcohol is not present in the flavor but presents somewhat of a welcoming burn through the nose.  The flavors are incredibly well-balanced.  The mouthfeel is prickly yet smooth, easy to drink yet thick and slightly sticky, wonderful to sip yet hard not to just drink it all at once!  This is an expertly crafted beer that does not disappoint!  I bet this beer would also pair nicely with any number of tasty cheeses, dried fruits, and nuts.  This is a great English-style barleywine with a tasty Belgian Golden Ale twist.

Palate is still very carbonated, with chewy caramel and a port essence that is just starting to emerge.

3064,"2008-03-04",4.4,"Bottle, #65. It looks gorgeous in the glass, with its amber body and a appropriate small, beige head. Theres a lot of yeast and a small amounts of small floaties in it, and it also has a little carbonation going on. The label said to pour gentle to avoid the yeast to enter the glass, but yeast is good for you, so dont listen to that, and it also gives an extra dimention to the experience. Aromawise, its one of those beer I almost cant get myselves to quit sniffing and start drinking. Theres a lovely combination of mellow maltyness and lots of hops, and to top it, theres a touch of alcohol in the background. Fruityness, sweetness, citrusy and piney notes, some cellar and yeast. Still I think theres something missing, but I can put my finger on it. In the mouth, its quite silky, with enough carbonation to break through most of the sweetness. The malts are not overpowered by all the hop varieties, giving flavors of caramel, prunes, dried figs, dark sugar, beef-stock and a little roasted hint. The hoppy flavors are sure present as well, but far from as present as I expected from a PNW BW, and they give the beer a balanced citrusy and piney touch with some canned pineapple blending in, and theres also enough alcohol to give warmth in the mouth. The finish is enduring, with sweet maltyness and hoppy bitterness, as well as some alcohol that warms my cheeks for a long time. Sure a potent brew, and a really beauty. Pity the bottle was so small and lonely, I could use another one right away. Points deducted for the beer being a bit on the sweet side, even though I really like sweet beers. Theres also too much carbonation for a barley wine in my opinion, but I also think it needs it. Some might say its too much alcohol in it too, but hey, its a BW goddammit.

As soon as I saw this on tap I knew I would have to give it a try.  Even at $7.00 for a tulip glass it was worth the cost.  If I would have had more room in my luggage I would have picked up a bottle to bring home and age.  This is worth trying if you ever run across it (what HoTD release isnt?).
Aroma / Appearance - A huge densely packed head rested above the thick caramel body.  It looks very similar to the Fred from the Wood which is no suprise given it is the base.  The nose however is totally different.  Honey, graham crackers and floral hops waft gently across the nose.
Flavor / Palate - Liquid rose petals wash across the throat.  Graham crackers, cheesecake and more floral notes come next.  The peachy finish wraps up an excellent experience.  The mouthfeel during that time is light and easy.  Rather than a traditional barleywine it feels more like a Belgian ale.

The aroma has a punch of hoppiness that is all over the place with spice, citrus and pine hop notes. The hoppiness is quickly dampened by a nice nose of caramel, dark fruity esters and alcohol phenols. The taste starts with a cherry bite aided by the carbonation followed by muted hop notes of pine and spice. Before the initial hop notes let go a creamy sweet caramel maltiness surfaces along with toffee, a rye twang, mild of dark fruity esters and a hint of biscuit. The hops re-take control of the flavor with a moderate bitter assault that continues to the finish. It ends with hop bitterness, sweet caramel maltiness and an alcohol tingling sensation. A year or two more would help.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Pours a beautiful lighter brown with just a hint of amber.  Wonderful lacing on the cream-colored head.  Aroma was a wonderful balance of malt and spicy notes.  The flavor was just off.  Theres some confusion on my pallet with the 10 different hops, to be honest.  It wound up just being a bunch of hops and not a great blend for me.  But there was also the aforementioned funk in the flavor, which Im sure is a result of the age of the bottle when I bought it.  The beer is rated too highly to have something this ""off"" in the flavor.  Id give it another try if I can get my hands on another one when Im on the West Coast.","Lexington, Massachusetts, USA","mvcramer"

Batch 67

Fred pours a hazy dirty copper with a great three finger tan head that lasts and lasts. The body glows with orange highlights when backlit and for some reason the head even seemes to have a tint of dirty orange to it. A few tiny carbonation bubbles rise to the big dense head keeping it busy. Leaves sheet lacing down the glass after each sip. 

This beer smells nothing like what I was expecting. The first thing that comes to mind is juicy but tart ripe green apples along with slivered almonds. Hmmm....interesting. Some caramel and semi-sweet pale maltiness lurk around in the back and theres a nice alcohol spiciness toward the end that adds a great complexity. Really interesting and delicious smelling. Makes my mouth water.

The maltiness comes through much more in the flavor than aroma. Caramel and toffee maltiness show through big along with a mid-palate leafy hoppy bitterness. The green apple tartness and quick but sharp nuttiness come through as well. This beer is as unique as it gets. Layers of complexity. The next sip never equals the last.

The mouthfeel is unbelievably luxurious and plush. Airy up front, creamy in the middle, and smooth as velvet on the finish. The carbonation level is perfect.

This beer goes down super easy but is without a doubt a sipper. I could drink it a little faster but with the sheer complexity I would be missing way to much.

Fred must have been a good man because the beer brewed in his honor is brewed with great care and unbelievable flavor. Id love to see the recipe for this beer. It fits in no catagory but has hints of many styles. Another great beer from Hair of the Dog. Adam and Ruth are two of my favorites from this year.

I wait for the head to recede.  And I wait.  And . . . I wait.  The carbonation action is fierce within the bowels of this deep gold cloud of infamy.

Aroma . . . I cant quite make out what it is, but it seems candied and good good good.  An IxPA thickness wafting about, but candied.

Flavor - Holy shit, its butterscotch.  The most welcome flavor one can hope for in a beer.  Heavier on the butterscotch by a factor of 10 than anything Ive ever had before.  No doubt its just the resin from countless hop varieties.

Palate - goes down like smooth light creamy liquid butterscotch.  What else is there to say?

Oh, the treasure that Jack Torrance was missing out on when he settled for bourbon on the rocks.  And Lloyd, being a 1920s bartender, how could he possibly have known better?

Faint rye bready notes drop in for a visit late.  Warm orange compote and apricot jam flavors are well balanced on soft piney rye-like tones.  Full bodied and smooth, soft carbonation, dry, bittersweet finish.  Unique, complex, and extremely tasty.  Great sipper for sure...","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
3064,"2007-08-06",4.1,"This $4.50 bottled brew from a bottle shop at the Portland Airport marked batch 68 poured a very large sized head of foamy finely sized off-white colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a very hazy dark orange brown colored body and a fair lacing. The funky aroma was malty spicy and vinous.  WOW what an initial rush it was! The mouth feel was strongly tingly at the start and weakly tingly at the finish with a very strong vinous aftertaste initial flavor rush. The stong vinous complex flavor contained notes of malt vinous and heavy brown malt. A wonderful best in class brew.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

Moderate, creamy, carbonation. The start is moderately dark fruit, caramel/toffee, some molasses and heat. More than ripe plum. All backed up with a pretty decent level of hoppy bitterness. There are suggestions of oaky wood. The finish is astringent. The bitter is present, but not overwhelming. To me it suggests Fullers Vintage Ale, but smoother and with more fruit.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
3064,"2007-07-31",4.0,"Rating 300, and fitting to invite my old pal Fred. The first HotD beer I ever had, at the Brickskeller, and holds up marvelously. Rare is the barleywine that can seamlessly manifest qualities of both an excellent tripel and a grand cru, but this one sure does. I big body, effervescent to the last, with a pleasantly cloudy look and a rich yeasty aroma. Its got the fruity tang of a nice tart tripel, but that lovely rich yeast strain that this brewery uses so effectively and some deep dark flavors to round it out - ripe plum, leather, and some notable molasses (this ones almost 2 years old, maybe this flavor emerges with age). At any rate, a righteous beer!","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Very sharp bitter malt flavor, with hops mixed in as well.  A little more bitter in the finish and especially the aftertaste.  The malts seem to overpower most of the flavor in the front, almost a little bit too much.  Maybe a little more balance is needed here.

3064,"2007-07-04",4.3,"Cloudy brownish-copper body topped by a large beige head leaving good lacings.  Like a good catchy song by talented musicians, appears relatively simple until you start dissecting it.  The malt profile is like a yummy sweet spicy waffle topped by a thick layer of delicious smooth butterscotch.  Quite a few spices but no particular one stands out.  Buried in that rich body also hide some fruity flavours (apricots? Plums?).  And lets not forget the large amount of unidentifiable hops.  Very creamy, very hoppy, rather spicy and overall somewhat dirty.  The alcohol is fairly apparent but it fits this over-the-top extravaganza.  The beer is sweet, maybe a bit too sweet for me but I suspect this could be fixed with a little aging.  Brewed to honour a beer writer.

It was definitely a full bodied beer that finished clean and smooth, but with the alcohol burn on the way down. My bottle was somewhat messed up from the long trip to my house, so it may have shaken up the alcohol a lot, but I dont know.

3064,"2007-06-13",4.3,"Man, why have I not had this before.  Not that I am surprised how good this is., actually its so good I have to make this my 600th rating.  Batch 63, 12oz. bottle, the reason I picked this up was that my local Whole Foods had two beers for 3 bucks and it was this with a Wolavers Oatmeal Stout.  So I figured I was getting a good deal.  Until now I just always passed up Fred thinking eventually I would get to it and this sale ended up being the impetus.  Back to the point, poured into a small tulip glass.  First of all this is the most liberal use of golden I have ever seen.  The label clearly states a Special Golden Ale and even though its definitely a special ale but its as a golden as Michael Jackson is black. The color is more like a thick, mosquito stuck in a maple-sap hard rock (a la Jurassic Park).  Very still looking with medium clarity.  Original pour has a small but prominent head.  It fades into nothingness with absolutely no lacing. Aroma is strong, candied apples hit the nose first.  Thats followed by an almost equally strong malty cherriness.  After that there is a lightly alcoholic tropical pruniness (if you could imagine a tropical prune). Some white wine flavors as well as a peach-like light liquor.  The malt is just creating some crazy aromas here.  Extremely complex, strong, and just plain lovely.  Flavor is not so heavy (something often associated with such strong brews) but full of flavor of sweet, lightly alcoholic tropical fruits (a la peaches and nectarines).  Very light alcohol felt on the edges of the throat.  Other flavors of spikey and tangy maltiness.  Mouthfeel is a bit thicker and syrupy with just enough carbonation to set it off.  A light-medium bitterness.  Leaves a long light cherry and lightly alcohol aftertaste, almost a minty feel on the palate.  Pretty much one of the finest barleywines I have ever had.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

Yes, my friends, this is good beer. Pours a nice dark auburn. Minimal head. Aroma is rich and of dates, caramel and dried fruit. Flavor is rich and yet balanced. I got lots of grapes and raisin flavors with some caramel but the bitterness (ten hop varieties!) balanced it out and gave it a good finish.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","alaskanwarren"

Aroma is nicely complex with loads of malty sweetness, caramel, molases, toffee, tropical fruit, slight alcohol, doughy bread, yeast. On the initial sip I got an alcohol warming sensation that slid all the way down my throat. Flavor has lots of alcohol, sight malty sweetness, lots of spiciness.

Flavor is initially caramel malt and dates, which is  followed by a dose of hops which also yileds a dry, bitter finish I didnt particularly care for.  Definite alcohol burn which becomes more pronounced as the beer warms.

3064,"2007-04-24",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2010 bottle split with Muenster for rating #900. Pours very nice, deep burgundy with varying shades depending on the depth of the beer. There is a fantastic tan head on top that lasts and lasts. Aroma is powerfully hoppy, yet somehow not aggressive like a IIPA. Many of the more acidic, biting notes are absent, leaving a soft citrus, flower bouquet with notes of pineapple, orange zest. Oaken scents are noted along with dark spices and tobacco. Mouthfeel is savory. Its slick and clingy with very appropriate carbonation. Hops are everywhere in the flavor with a delicious, deep world of bright, floral flavors. Plenty of malts are present with hints of caramel, peat, cigar, vanilla, earth, macadamia nuts. This is so complex and bold, I love it. The finish leaves just a slight burn over my palate and is very warming. Tremendous brew here. I have to say this is way better than the barrel aged version, in my humble opinion. I really wish we could get some HoftD offerings somewhere remotely close to my home.


[Oct 23, 2007]

 Bottle batch #59. This stuff is about two years old now and I have to say Im a little skeptical going into this. The pour is just as I remembered, thick with beautiful layers beneath the white, frothy head. This is some of the best head retention Ive ever seen. Lacing is dense after a swirl. I do get some muted, oxidized hop notes but they are not off-putting here. Rich floral aromas still highlight things with additional hints at pineapple.  The flavor really shines with some age on it. Everything has melded nicely and I get very few ""dead"" qualities. Its richly sweet, but not excessive at all. Notes of honey, toffee, peanut brittle, citrus abound. This beer is amazingly well made, it is soaked with professionalism and craftsmanship. The bottom line: though I did greatly enjoy this bottle, ( very rare for me to enjoy a 2-year old brew) I prefer the fresher Fred as it has some outstanding hop qualities and clashing flavors which I love,  that eventually fade.

[March 29, 2010]

Bottle of batch 76 from Kahns. Hair of the Dog makes some damn good beers. Just the appearance alone of this drips with craftsmanship. The solid light copper color is just perfectly cloudy with active carbonation and a massive white head floats which caves into formations. The aroma is super hoppy, but not really like any other super hoppy American beer. It has an identity all its own with very much pineapple, mango, rye, orange zest, and grass. Despite the fruity descriptors I feel compelled to use, this is not a basic strong, hoppy American ale. This is much juicier, more complex and lacks a real bold, aggressive bite without sacrificing any level of aroma or flavor. The palate is solid: thick and lively without being overly sticky. A unique creation this is. Loads of flavors engage my palate: notes of honey, rye, flowers, pineapple, mango, grass, eucalyptus, green tea. Ah, this is truly enjoyable. Fred earns bonus points on its finesse and individuality.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

3064,"2007-03-04",4.2,"Pours a dirty copper tan color, with a large very fluffy head.  Aroma is very cakelike at first, but after the first few sniffs, I can pick up plenty of other things.  Theres plenty of citrus, mainly oranges, some molasses and brown sugar, a light pine, wood, pepper, all held together by this sweet doughy element.  Tastes almost like a Belgian interpretation of an American barley wine, if one can imagine that.  Caramel, wood, brown sugar, and a dry bitter hop flavor combine with a real strong yeast presence.  Though the beer has a sweet malt flavor, I think the aroma is sweeter.  The taste is less cakelike and more woody/earthy.  Some raisins become more apparant now.  The finish has a light grapefruit flavor, along with some backseat sweetness.  The hops shine here, covering the bases of pine, citrus, charcoal, and wood in a balanced fashion.  Bitter and very dry, but not too bitter. Beer feels thick, but drinkable enough, and bit too carbonated for me.  A very balanced beer and like Adam, defies all styles while combining good qualities from many.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

Pours a hazy burnt amber, with a very substantial three finger head that takes forever to settle to a thick layer of foam, leaving behind a solid sheeting of lace.

Smell; the first thing I smell is bitter hops, which is good since I like a hoppy barleywine. Caramel and toffee maltsare there as well as a little bit of dark fruits.

Taste; the hops are there, but not really as strong as the nose lead me to believe. Even so, their presence is welcome and not disapointing at all. The caramel malts come out nicely and adds a very syrupy sweetness to smooth out the hops. In the finish theres a bit of cherries, and other darks fruits.

Aromas are of light malts with a hint of molasses, light hops with grass notes, and alcohol. Initial taste is lightly sweet, finishing with a boldly moderate sweet. Medium on the palate, were left with a creamy texture, soft carbonation, and a moderate alcohol tinge.

Flavor is intensely woody, with peat, musty autumn leaves and a strong tobacco finish, crushed with sweet malt.  Thick and rich mouthfeel like swallowing the remnants of centuries-old wild honey. 8/4/8/4/17 4.1  

Batch 63, likely from late 04 or early 05.  A peppering of grainy sediment through a firey orange body; a generous, gooey raft of white.  Aroma first is like a french dessert white wine; full of floral tones, honey, and delicate fruit character.  Citrus fruit, white fruit, tropical fruit, candied fruit.  Bursting with fine trimmed detail.  Tanned musty leaves, sandalwood, and cinammon lend a restrained counterpart of rustic, smoky sweetness.  Yeasts layer thickly underneath; everything swarms together warmly on this chunky core of sweet dough.  Apple cider vinegar and fresh cut grass further down.  Beautifully full at first, and fading slowly given some breathing.  Flavor seems simpler.  Good vodka.  Honey crusted grilled rye.  Pineapple.  Floral perfumes.  Oak and almost lactic tartness; pear skins, vanilla, sweet pine smoke.  Mid palate is a milky softening; a retreat of sorts.  Pine bitterness and cloying peppermint cream candies.  Mouthfeel is somewhat sharp with carbonation; doughy, dense, firm.  Ludicrously high drinkability on this one.  Finishes with some citrus, peppercorns, and rye bread.

Aroma - decent strength - mostly orangy citrus, some sweetness, and a little bit of wine-like character.  Some of what makes me think there will be a sourness or tartness in the beer.  Rye?  Flavor - High up front bitterness. On the tongue mainly I get some sweetness, but also some citrus, some sharp bitterness, and a faint bit of alcohol.  This beer probably has the most complex after swallow mix of flavors Ive ever had - some citrus, some alcohol warmth, tiny bit of tartness, and then it moves to a sweet, carmelly, almost molasses-like flavor that changes and stays around for a long, long time.  Palate - pretty full-bodied, almost chewy in the mouth.  A little warmth.  Good, avg. carb.  Overall - Very interesting beer.  Looks good, although cloudy with some floaties - Darker than I expected from the bottle calling it a golden ale.  Good aroma, although heavy on the citrus.  Tons and tons of complexity in the flavor - love that.  Palate is good for the beer.

3064,"2006-08-30",4.7,"Batch 63.  Pours a clear rich red amber with a towering white head, settling into a rocky mass.  The nose is truly exceptional.  Big sweet rounded, though not cloying in the least, malt.  Balance is achieved by a culmination of sharp spicy rye and slightly grapefruit seed hops.  There is a strong underlying fruitiness (reminiscent of guava and slightly pineapple?), which I wouldnt have thought of working with the rye so well.  The palate is truly top notch.  Thick and viscous with low carbonation, though still a bit creamy.  Even a bit slippery/chewy.  Near perfection.  The flavors are truly a kick in the mouth.  Rabid rye dominates this incredibly sweet deep malt.  The spice compliments the pungent grapefruit seed hops.  Theres some grass, tropical fruit, and a slight touch of alcohol.  Perhaps some more or less tannic (reminiscent of tea?) flavors appear in the finish.  the aftertaste quickly becomes amongst the most hoppy and bitter (in a very good way) experiences.  Perhaps there is even some roast in the aftertaste.  Even my lips taste bitter.  The alcohol warming kicks in a bit later than in most beers.  Truly complex.  Though Im not a big fan of hoppy barleywines, this is clearly one of my favorite beers to date.  I think this is because this reminds me much more of a strong IIPA than a barleywine.

Great appearance from well designed label to the solid caramel colored liquid with a yellowish-light tan head. The aroma holds a lot of the qualities youd expect from a barley wine: caramel malt, a bit of citrusy hops but also some of the spicy/fruity/yeasty elements youd find in a lot of Belgian styles. The flavor seems like a good combonation of the two: lots of bitter pine and grapefruit backed with yeast, alcohol, cherry, and a light malt character.

The finish was pretty dry and has thinned out over the 7ish years.  I will try a recent one when I get the chance because even this one was still decent.  It got a few bonus overall points for holding up so long.  Batch 23.  No notes just yummy","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
3064,"2006-05-23",3.9,"From 12oz Bottle.  Pours the color of fresh honey, tinged with a splash of sunset red, and topped with a giant pile of creamy head.  The aroma is pleasantly full, but in a peaceful, laid back kind of way.  Supple brown sugars entwine with washed iris petals, creating a floral garden bouquet thats delicately sweet.  A few tender dark fruits also meagerly peek through, taking the shape of strawberries and unspiced fig.  A very subtle splash of dry sherry completes the olfactory experience.  Very creamy, expertly crafted mouthfeel with a honeyed tangerine sweetness accompanied by some mild pine.  It is at this point that the contemplation of a plus-four rating starts to fade out of mind.  As the delicate flavors fade from the palate, sweet light fruits removed one-by-one, a bitter piney hop blast is nakedly exposed beneath.  Strangely out of balance - the delicate lei of flower petals and honey is the stand out feature on my palate, but unfortunately, the strong hops presence erodes this pleasant sensation away before a final smack of rye seed and pine cones.  Still, a very interesting and highly enjoyable beer overall.  Thanks, Tom!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Made a good appearance, poured a golden amber with a frothy, foamy white head that slowly settled into a thin, sticky, foamy lacing, good carbonation.

Had a sweetish tropical fruity nose with a caramel maltiness at the edges and big whiffs of spicy alcohol.

A crisp. slick textured and carbonated smooth medium bodied mouth feel, good sipping drinkability. 

Tropical fruity and spicy rye malty taste, the hop bitterness rolls on the tongue through out the taste, a subtle toasted graininess, a nice warming alcohol presence in the palate, and a spicy, yeasty and sweet fruity finish with the taste lingering in the mouth.

Its incredibly dense and thick, almost goopy. Very much a dessert beer. Its taken me two hours to get through ~6 ounces. Where to begin with the flavor? Vanilla, caramel, herbs, a tingling bitter hop finish. The sweetness is a bit mutable; at times there seems to be butterscotch. Incredibly subtle, complex, and delicious, but its the most occasional of rare treats.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

Enjoyed on the night of Robs barleywine tasting, and a wonderful way to break the Lenten fast. The batch 22 pours a cloudy color, but the palate features a variety of flavors. Its rich, silky, and notes of vanilla and grass meet the typical barleywine profile. Theres unfortunately, just a tad bit of wet cardboard that i thought might be the age, but I also noted this on Batch 58. 58 is much lighter in color, not as complex, and still way too hoppy for my tastes. I get more cherry flavors from the 58, although the recent batch didnt blow me away. The experience did reveal, however, that ageing this would be a great idea.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
3064,"2006-04-06",3.9,"Hair of the Dog beers always remind me of good strong homemade beers. This is a bottle from batch 54. Beer has a rich complex aroma of smoky malt, spicyness, fruity esters with some high alcohol coming through in the end. Beer is a dark amber cloudy brew with a thick and full light tan colored head that hung on quite some time. A very good malt flavor with a nice hop bitterness and flavor to match. The beer has a slight oxidation that comes through in the finsh but it blends well in most good barleywines. It is unique compared to most american style barleywines in that it seems to combine some of the english and american style of barleywines. This is a very good barleywine that I will buy again.","Mt.

Topped with a super foamy off-white head. Aroma of warm bready figs and pears, backed with gentles fusels, like spice and a touch of celery. Flavor continues on a similar note with warm rich brandy, more pears and a hint of cinnamoned apples. Spicy yeasts. A very mature and complex flavor, with alcohol that is a touch too hot. Figgy for a paler beer. Complex, with brandywin figginess. Lemon and coriander bright ness. Finishes with a light dryness of grass and euro hops, again sophisticated. Well balanced. But, I dont agree with this as a Barleywine.

3064,"2006-03-20",3.5,"Two single bottles of Fred were hiding in the back of my local store for quite some time, so I decided to finally give it a try. The bottle from Batch 51 poured with a huge fluffy yellowish head above a clear orange body. Soapy alveoli formed against the sides of the glass while the top of the head was enveloped in a creamy blanket. The nose is immediately hoppy and has only furthered my confusion about the definition of a barley wine. Nonetheless, grapefruit, pine and burnt toast are prominent in the aroma and conjugate with the walnuts, pineapple, coriander and surprising ketchup fragrances. A certain floral quality is decidedly noticeable as well as smooth salted caramel that becomes increasingly emphasized with warming. The flavor reflects the nose, especially in the citrussy hoppiness promoted by grapefruit and orange zest, nuts and carbonized toast are also quite conspicuous. Mango as well as butter and mustard are also apparent and are really the only defining traits of this brew. Admittedly the thick creamy texture is appreciable but the strong bitter aftertaste is detracting to me. Fred reminds me of a sweet IPA, and as such reverbates the narrowness in character of this beer.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Here a decent, rich head was the result.  A fine aroma, of pine, grapefruit, vanilla, and fruit was huge, and then the flavors were similarly bold.

3064,"2005-11-10",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2009 Batch 56. 12oz bottle. Tasted at around 54° in my NB worthy glass. Pours hazy orange, gold, red with a fat cream colored head the collapses slowly. Plenty of settlement, throughout, but really concentrated in the bottom of the glass.  Guess I should poured more carefully... The aroma is caramel long john with a lot of spicy, citrusy hops. In fact I think different types of hops really give it a multi-layered aroma. Smells fantastic. The taste is brown sugar and cajeta at first before the hops invade with their complex flavor and moderate to substantial bitterness. There is some yeast and flour in the aftertaste along with a tingly mouthful of pleasantly bitter hops. The mouthfeel is huge. This is just a big beer in every sense of the word. Big alcohol, big malt, big hops, big flavor. Powerful stuff. 8/4/8/5/17   
Vertical tasting with Theisti. We had the 49, 67 & 70. It is neat to try this beer in different stages of its maturation. New, it seems to be alcoholic and very spicy, but in 6 short years, it mellows into a sublime beer. This rating is for the batch 49 that is 6+ years old. Cookie dough, dark caramel, toffee, black pepper and a slight vegetal aroma. Flavor is sweet, malty, moderately oxidized, with dark caramel and woodsy and herbal notes. Moderate alcohol. 9/4/8/5/17.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Aroma of apples and candied fruits. Bittersweet flavor with the bitterness taking the lead. Notes of white chocolate, cola and grapefruit hides below the bitterness. Sweet, but not cloying. It seems a bit Belgian, but is less funky and more bitter, making it more drinkable, even though the bitterness becomes a bit mouth numbing in the finish. Creamy mouth feel in spite of the relatively powerful carbonation. and feels thick on the tongue. The alcohol is incredible well hidden.
Rerate Dec. 26 2006 (Batch 65): Still gorgeous looking beer, but way to sweet, with the bitterness sticking out like sore thumb and coating your palate.

Palate is thick, syrupy, and amply carbonated; the taste begins sweet and raisiny followed immediately with a strong nip of alcohol. Notes of smoke and wood follow in time, before yielding to a pleasingly bitter hop finish.

Taste is pleasantly malty with elements of Pacific hops, barbecue sauce and wintergreen.

3064,"2005-04-14",3.7,"This things been aging for about a year; theres some brown fuzz on the inside of the cap, and the sediment on the bottom has kind of chunkified. Big pffft when opening.   I was pouring very slowly, and noticed how clear the beer was  until the very end when a few of the chunkies slipped by, immediately making everything Very cloudy.  There is a general wispy-white cloudiness, but also some dark brown flecks that settle to the bottom of the glass after about five minutes.  Lets hope none of this adversely affects the beer as a whole.

On to the important stuff.  This thing has Belgian written all over it.  The aroma is yeasty and a little spicy, with some apricot showing through.  The flavor is kind of musty and dry, mouthfeel a little chalky.  The head was big and grainy when first poured, but now just lies in a thin sheet.  I think this has got to be the most opaque golden ale Ive ever had.  

But the sum of the parts is a relatively coherent, tasty whole.  Reminds me a lot of one of the abbey ales, perhaps Orval.  I like this, but was wondering what happened to the hops.  Certainly not your typical American strong ale, even if it is tasty.","Dallas, Texas, USA","monty"

The taste starts ""hot"" with noticeable alcohol component and a heavy spicy quality. Undertone of fruit (banana, pear, and grapefruit) runs throughout but quickly is subdued. The malt is there but it is quite undefined and really is an afterthought. A almost sour and very earthy aftertaste. The feel is equally disappointing, too sharp for the nature of flavors.

A sweet fruit aroma of pear and apricot that reminds me of a abbey doubel or tripel.  Flavor is of dried and rotten fruits such as: banana, plum, pear, and sour green apples.

3064,"2005-02-25",3.5,"bottle, batch #51 (bought in Denver 11/04) - when I opened this beer, foam started to roll out of the bottle almost immediately.  Hazy orange pour with a rocky white head.  Yeastly aromas, doughy, fruity.  Fairly complex aroma.  From the HOD webpage, I can surmise that this was brewed in mid 2003, and bottled in late 2003.  Not sure of the storage conditions in Denver, but it has set in cellar for 3+ months.  Back to the aroma, I detect a bit of banana also.  Prickly tongue, acidic, yeastly.  This is a bit harsh to start.  I wonder if the aging helped this beer along?  Some banana noticable, definite hop zing to finish.  This is extremely complex, as something new comes out with each sip.  Alcohol is evident, overall this is very interesting.

I was too busy getting over the surprise to write, so I let it mellow a couple more minutes.  Now the sweet maple syrup flavor comes out.  Malty the whole way through with a bready finish.

Theres also a bit of tinned tropical fruit salad, but sadly hop aroma is absent. Tastes really good - like a saison/barleywine hybrid. Nice tight candy-ish malt without being thick or fat like some BWs, then a big solid hoppiness and good bitter finish. Its all surrounded by loads of fruit - apricot, banana, quite a bit like Dupont actually.

Sweeter with yeast swirled in. Dry. Sugery sweetness of the yeast provides a neccessary counterpoint to the dry, peppery uncompromising hops. Fascinating and unique, but Im not sure how enjoyable. Theres some moderate fun chasing around the hops and attempting to identify them, and theres a pleasure in experiencing such a free and individual beer.

3064,"2004-12-09",3.8,"This is the third brew I have had from HOTD and each one has had a MASSIVE head.  This one poured out a beautiful orange color with a head that initially looks like whipped cream on top.  As it settles down it becomes pocked with craters and begins to resemble melting ice cream.  I have to say this is just gorgeous to look at.  The aroma is citrus and floral with a hint of alcohol.  I would expect more alcohol aroma for its generous 10%.  There is actually very little initial flavor.  A fresh sip demonstrates some sharp carbonation with the flavor appearing the longer the fluid rests on the tongue.  There is a lasting aftertaste that I dont necessarily appreciate, but it isnt aweful.  I think there is a touch of bitterness that prevents the sweetness from overpowering the mix.  The alcohol is extreamly well disguised.  The bottle names this beer a ""Golden Special Ale"".  Ratebeer calls it a barley wine.

Pine and plastic. Thin sharp plastic.Mint, bubblegum. Satisfying. Hops pervade the palate. Sweetness comes and goes quickly as though it were running, hops stay and linger. Alcohol noted, burning but held in check by the dense gravity this beer suspends itself in. Excellent brew. I like this and would drink it regularly if it weren;t a two and a half hour drive away.

3064,"2004-10-11",4.5,"Batch # 56, Sampled October 2004
This particular Fred is quite carbonated, it pours with a frothy dense off white head.  The beer itself is a hazy, orange-copper color.  Oh-yeah, the aroma is quite intoxicating, it has a characteristically American hop punch in the aroma that reminds me of oranges, grapefruit and pine.  Soon after that first whiff the hops fade a bit a sort of funky, husky graininess begins to come to the fore.  The mix between this and the fresh hop character is quite interesting.  The aroma on this beast is really quite interesting, fruity and funky at the same time.

The taste has the same competing pungent characteristics.  The hops are here with a citrusy kick of tangerines, orange, grapefruit and even some pineapple.  The funky grain character is here in the finish, though the hops are the taste that lingers the longest, with a sort of herbal, fresh cut, astringent note that just sticks to my mouth (though in a good way). This beer really is quite carbonated, almost overly so, luckily this is easily remedied by swirling my glass.  This beer is so damn good, The last time I had it was from a 1.5 liter bottle that had been aged for 5 years, it was equally delicious, but a completely different beast.  There is just so much interesting flavor packed into this beer, and I am really enjoying this right now.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3064,"2004-10-03",4.0,"The color is a dark distant sunset. Very bright and nearly glowing. The head is big, rocky and creamy. It laces very well. A healthy looking beer. 

Fred has a lovely aroma. Quite spicy and citric with orange, lemon and tangerine. Very floral, very fruity.

Start is fruity (lemons, oranges.) Blending ten hop varieties together this well is pretty astounding and a credit to how good the Hair of the Dog brewers really are. Balanced by a lot of sweetness from the malt. Tons of citrus flavors. Apricots and a pretty harsh alcohol bite. Though, It does lessen as the beer warms. Excessive carbonation. The finish is dry, very hoppy and slightly tangy. Cloying at times. Still very good. 

Hair of the dog is an amazing brewery. They makes these bizarre beers that can barely be classified into a beer style but they are all delicious. Adam was incredible and this is very good. Though if I had the choice between the two I would certainly always pick Adam. Doggie Claws 2002 was very good but I have a 2003 in the fridge that I have heard many good things about.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"

Taste: yeast and citric fruit, with thick, full malt are the biggest, juiciest part of this brew, nicely hopped, and with a thoroughly tangy mouthfeel. Medium bodied, with a long, fruity, citric finish.
Id forgotten the style when I cracked the cap and started into the brew, but now its clear that its meant as a tripel, but ends up being a rather intriguing variant. Thick, chewy, sticky, fruity, gummy, yummy, this Fred is much like its namesake, a unique, particular specimen that is rich in character and defies categories, a cantankerous, unruly ale that stretches boundaries and delights tastebuds.

3064,"2004-08-09",4.1,"Thank you to BrooklynBoy for this one...Batch #46.  Pours turbid orange, with more foamy, white head than a Manhattan socialite party.  First off, I love the label here.    My apologies to Fred Eckhardt, who I've just had a chance to read up on.  I was not aware of Fred's illustrious history in the brewing world.  My ignorance is not an excuse, and Fred, cheers, and more power to you, man!  Anyway, on to the beer, which is the main point of this text.   Big aroma of malt, hopflocit, barnyard earth and spice.  Tastes malty, very rich, with a big fruitiness, florals, spice, barnyardiness, and some bier de gardishness in the finish.  Also, I noticed apricot, chardonnay, and scotch.  The palate is dense, full, smooth, slightly astringent.  The head stayed put all the way through this one...looking like a rootbeer float at the end.  Even my copious forehead oils couldnt dent this head.  Also, let me clarify that the term ""barnyard"" here is definitely a good thing...much different than say....going down on your girlfriend and describing it as a ""barnyard odor and flavor"".  Doing that would definitely get you two knees to the head.  I put this one at 2 parts bier de garde, 1 part Belgian tripel, and 2 parts Belgian strong ale, with all parts being equally delicious.  I cant wait to try the other HOTD styles.  Actually, this one was very Unibroueish in taste, aroma, and finish.  Very good.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"

Let me tell you about Fred.  Fred has a nice fluffy head which lasts the duration of the date with Fred.  Fred also has decent lacing as he is very upscale.  He has a very plesant and complex aroma with apricots and lots of sweet malts and hops.  Loaded with caramel and toffee also.  His color is a very handsome orange/amber.  And then we kissed.  It was like heaven on my lips.  Big time malts and hops but very well balanced.  Again loads of caramel malts and coffee.  Very chewy.  I must say that Fred is put together very well if you know what I mean.  Yet a very mysterious man.  Hiding his massive alcohol content in this subtle package.  Bad Fred, bad.  To finish the night off we danced a little.  He is very soft yet warming from his alcohol content.  As we danced he carressed my palate and when he left, I was delighted to find a soft thin film in my mouth.  Not going to tell where that came from, snicker, snicker.  I must say that Fred was a delight as a date and one that I will always remember and will look forward to the next time I roll into his town.  Sweet dreams Fred, you stud you.

3064,"2004-03-05",4.4,"From batch number 46. 12 oz. brown bottle. No freshness date seen anywhere, but let's face facts, none is really needed at this strength. Loud pfffttt when opened. Poured out a murky, cloudy, full of yeast burnt orange color, with an enormous head that wouldn't quit. I don't know what HOTD puts in their beers to make the head so huge, but it works, and works well. Almost too well.
Anyway, it smells like fresh cut Timothy hay, candi sugar, Brach's caramel candies, and alcohol. No fusels in here though, which is a really good thing. Tastes are exactly like it smells. Caramel candies, strong malt backbone, sweet esters, almost floral in taste.
Hops make their presense known, but in a vague sort of way. It's like you know they're there, but they sneak in and out on you. This is truly a great beer, and Fred Eckhardt should be very proud they named a beer after him. Finished sweet, caramel-ly, and slightly hoppy.

I think this one has peaked and is slowly going on down the other side, but in any case, had some differences from batch 51. Some murkiness in the appearance of this orange/brown beer.

The flavor was good, but just lacked a some of the stand out, brilliant characteristics of the one formerly rated.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"

One of the best appearances Ive seen.  Hazy, completely clouded orange/amber.  Very bright and layered.  Starts out with a mild caramel malt, some citric hops come in to play along with a meaty earthiness.  Finish is balanced, smooth and has some herbal liqueur notes.  Alcohol only slightly apparent.  Sweetness well balanced by alcohol and hops.  Nothing dominates, though the finish does get a little heavy with alcohol after the beer has warmed.  Finish needs some work, slightly muddled overly yeasty/alcohol flavor.  This is pure quality stuff and incredible that it tastes this fresh out of the bottle.  Great candied peach aftertaste.

Good balance and complexity with flavors ranging from citrus and peach to malt and sourdough bread finishing with a nice hop sting.  Very appealing to the palate with mild hop and citrus sting.

Says this is a ""Golden Special Ale"".
Ok lets see..
WEll its a good looking beer but doesnt look very ""golden"" I poured it into my Chimay goblet and its lovelly amber/ chesnut brown hazy beer..with a gorgeous creamy large off white head..as usual the goblet channels a steady flow of carbonation up the middle of the beer..very attractive brew!
The beer has a very strong aroma but its curiously balanced..between the lovelly malts and the hops ( there are apparentlly 10 different kinds in this!
A very nice warming ale to taste starts with a rich creamy sweet maltiness progresses to about three different kinds of bitterness through to the alcoholic warmth at the end,
Smooth and creamy on the palate with a great alcoholic warmth.

3064,"2003-11-10",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2005 I dont quite remember the batch number, but it was not more than a couple months old. The appearance is stuff of legend, bottle-conditioned with sediments floating in the snifter, beautiful cloudy amber body and a HOTDs HUGE off-white head, rocky, sticky, like a snowy mountain chain. Aroma is mostly complex stages of hops, its easy to believe there are 10 varieties, theres the big american C hops character combined with the refined English ones. Very relaxing to sniff on and ultra-complex, like a touch of vanilla on fresh citrus (grapefruit). In mouth this dances on the tongue, nice effervescence, creamy, full-bodied, complex maple malt sweetness and an obvious balancing yeastiness. This is a delicious big generous beer. Long Life HOTD. Tasting this with my buddy MartinT, we came to the conclusion that given the choice to pick only 2 beers from a same brewery to have an infinite supply of, HOTD with Fred and Adam would probably win over quite anyone. *High-fives Jazz88*  A re-sample of an aged bottle (batch 36 in october 2004) proposed a terrific alcohol hiding job and far more subdued hoppiness. I was not quite able to appreciate all the hop garden/maze in there as well as the first time, but it remained just as adorable. I would have raised the score higher if it werent for the feeling that this is actually so sweet in a maple syrup kind of way that it becomes hard to finish the bottle. Definitely a beer you feel you could drink fast, but that you must drink slow to enjoy fully. World-Class.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

I'm sure that the fine folks at HOTD Brewing would be most pleased by my choice of stemware for their fine brew.  Anyway, this brew pours a dirty murky amber with pale melon highlights and floating yeast mothers despite my best attempts at proper decanting.  The thin fizzy white head is fully diminishing with no lacing.  The robust nose is alcohol, oranges, peaches and cream in oatmeal, flowers, and as the brew warms raisins and dates can be detected.  The flavor is sweet, spicy, warm and tangy.  The long floral finish is rounded out by a splash of dried fruit.  The full dry body is fizzy and finishes chalky.

3064,"2003-10-20",4.2,"Rated Batch #48 and Batch #4 side-by-side.  Ratings above reflect averages of the two.          Batch #4: Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, bought at Stuffed Sandwich in San Gabriel, CA 10/20/03.  No head at all on vigorous, slow pour.  It looks almost bourbon-like in texture and dark, beautiful ruby-caramel in color.  Fantastic nose like a fine barley wine should have, but this one is truly exceptional, even among the greats-- warming caramel alcohol (like a dessert flambe), decadent malt, and shades of fruit, maybe pear.  Literally mouth-wateringly good.  First taste reveals a complex malt, caramel, resinous flavor and incredibly creamy, buttery texture.  Slight burn of alcohol creates activity and excitement, not to mention an almost immediate warming sensation in my tummy.  Slightly sweet and a bit tangy, but amazingly smooth for as much alcohol as there is (11.5%, plus whatever has been added as it has aged).  Finish reveals a dark, bitter side that punishes with intensity.  That's where the bulldog shows his teeth.  Dirty and slowly diminishing to a subtle sting of dark malt, somewhat leathery, then suddenly very drying and mellow.  This beer moves and changes all the way from its first scent to the last trace of its finish.  Great stuff.  Reminds me of the old Anchor Old Foghorn, only not quite as good.  10/3/9/5/17/4.4          Batch #48: Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, bought at Trader Joe's in Pasadena, CA 10/20/03.  The magnificent frothy head fluffs on a gentle pour and lingers forever.  Wonderful lacing and a violent carbonation-cyclone tearing up from the bottom of the glass.  Pour gets much hazier as you move down the bottle, from virtually transparent to completely opaque.  Light caramel color.  Nose is fruity (apricot) and almost floral with hops, still strongly alcoholic but not nearly so deep as the #4.  A little bit spicy, like coriander.  First taste is mostly strong toasted malt, potently bitter hops, and burning alcohol, but the unbelievable head cushions the burn nicely.  Finish is dark and bitter, maybe too strongly bitter for its own good.  Doesn't change much or unfold to the mellow hum as elegantly as the aged Fred, but it still changes.  As the bitterness leaves, it's nicely drying and mellow, like a honeycomb without the honey.  This reminds me of the new Anchor Old Foghorn, only better. 8/5/7/3/16/3.9          If you have some Fred, AGE IT!

Has a cloudy, murky brown appearance - lots of floating sediment. Flavor - like sweet toffee. The alcohol is evident but not overpowering at all. More dopplebock sweetness to it than a Barley Wine in my opinion. Good, thick mouthfeel. Overall, an excellent beverage.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"

3064,"2003-07-26",4.4,"12 oz bottle. This is a very very good ale. I couldn't believe the head on this bad boy. It was sudsy and fluffy and took up about 2/3 of my westvleteren glass. It stuck around awhile as well, having a constant inch of fluffiness floating on top of the hazy brown liquid. The aroma is FULL. Peach, pear, alcohol fills the nostrils. The taste is COMPLEX. It actually changes as you drink it. At the begining the hops came through more than the malt, then I noticed the fruit tones more, and near the end I was getting this awesome spike of sugar on my toungue with a nice dry finish. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.","Redondo Beach, California, USA","drinkbeer"
3064,"2003-07-23",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2004 Fred is labeled as a ""Golden Special Ale"". At 10% abv and using 10 different hop varieties I would agree that it is indeed something special. It was also a nice golden color as promised by the name. My bottle possibly suffered some shaking at some point in its life as the head was out of control. It took me 5 minutes plus to pour the thing. Even then it took a wee while before it abated enough to even think about drinking it. Aroma was nice, I could smell those hops as well as a generous helping of malts. Taste plenty of hops, a good round malt nose. The bottle had a nice layer of yeast sediment in it proving that this is a bottle conditioned ale. At 10% abv I was worried that it might be a little bit harsh, but it was not at all. The bottle copy says that the beer is made with 10 different hop varieties from 5 different countries. I believe it, the hop complexity is amazing. There are very floral hops in there (cascades?) as well as some traditional European hops (Saaz?). Regardless of the exact ingredient list this is a beer well worth seeking out.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"
3064,"2003-07-12",3.6,"Nice orange amber with a perfect head that rimes the beer nicely. Very fruity aroma is reminiscent of two better barleywines (Port Townsend Barleywine and Pyramid 500 year old Ale).  The flavor was moderately complex, leaning decidely towards a candy orangish with an accompanying slight sourness. Syrupy smooth with a light bitter finish that dissapears momentarily after each sip. Alcohol is balanced well. Another fine Barleywine for the PNW.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
3064,"2003-07-11",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2006 June 2006 - Oh what a difference a few years makes on ones palate! I really was not ready for this the first go round. Ruby body with a small tan head despite a vigourous pour. Big aroma of hops, malt, and alcohol (which increases as it warms) not quite citrusy. Bitter hops and a slight bite/tang that I do not know where to attribute - the hops or the rye malt? Hops seem simple at first glance, yet have a strong depth of character and a solid foundation. Big syrupy palate with light pleasant carbonation. Very nice beer. Deceptively brilliant, a very nice beer. 7-8/3/8/4/16-18 - 4.1<P>

Oct 2000 - Looks and smells somewhat like malt extract. Hot alcoholy taste..warms you from the first sip! Cant quite place the flavor. Sort of bitter, but different.

3064,"2003-07-08",3.9,"Ginormous head; I did not follow the instructions very well - pour slowly. With the overflow I think an ounce or two ended up on the counter. No matter there was still plenty left to kick my butt. Nicely complex in the nose and flavor dept,  spicy sweet with a plethora of hops tracing across the tounge to balance the alcohol quite nicely. Had to look for the ABV percentage half way through to confirm the warm feeling I was getting. A very interesting creation, does not really fit in a single style, more like a Belgian-Barley.","Laguna Niguel, California, USA","elnadeau"

The rye was totally obliterated.  7:3:7:3:16 RERATE:  7/1/06, Batch 63, thanks to Numenor.  Medium amber, OK head.  Loads of caramel, toffee, and pine.

Fresh, fresh aroma, subtle, sweet, fine, yeasty, malty, and bitter all at the same time (I even detected a hint of green apple) - this beer is astonishingly complex and has a perfect palate. First it's sweet, then heavy and malty, then light and smooth, but with no demarcation - it all flows seamlessly.

A bit cloudy, with noce lingering head.  i dont think I would call this a barley wine except for the fact that its very high in alcahol.  Rerate 090604:  Batch 52.  Be carefulpouring this one.  Carbonation is very active.  Carbonation comes up from the bottom of the glass like smoke from a cigarette.  Very fruity with lots of fig.  Lots of honey also.

Flavor is malty, fair amount of caramel, definite presence of rye towards the middle, with a spicey finish, well balanced that leans just slightly to the bitter side. A little over carbonated for my tastes. 

Pours a cloudy dark orange color with a beautiful velvet-like white head. Aroma is reminds me of a belgian tripel:  orange and strawberries give a fruity character, with light hoppy notes interspersed, a candi sugar backbone intermingled with malt and belgian spices. Flavor is malty up front, with candi sugar lending a perfect amount of sweetness, very carbonated (a little too much), with a slighlty bitter finish and an alcohol warmth as is drops down. Very crisp and clean; hides its alcohol remarkably well. An exellent brew.","Salt Lake City, Utah, USA","JasonG"

This has a vanilla sweetness that balances with the hop bitterness.  A long finish that starts out sweet and ends dry.  The alcohol becomes evident as it warms up during the tasting.  A different beer, I love it, because it has a lot of things going on, but it is almost in a class/style of its own.

3064,"2002-12-09",4.5,"This beer rocks.
They might have tried incorportating the whole world into this beer, but basically, the place I taste is Belgium. Barley Wine? Ok, whatever. Looks and tastes a bit like a Belgian Trippel to me.
Notes of sour apple, curdled cream,  butterscotch, yeast, fuzzy fruits and alcohol in the nose.
A good looking, hazy, deep amber beer. It has a large, rocky, off-white head. Mostly lasting with decent lacing.
The flavor is so complex, I wont go too far into it here. However, the rye malt (as it always does) adds an interesting and drying element to the beer. Heavily malty and sweet with bursts of butterscotch, caramel and toffee up front. Nicely hopped (10 varieties) with a hint or two of milk chocolate, clover, an unidentified spice and that not-so-subtle rye flavor that shows up in very few beers and pure rye whiskey.
Full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel. Soft carbonation. A long, moderately bitter, slightly and pleasantly sweet, yet dry and alcoholic finish. I could go on...","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

Aroma has lots of sweet caramel malt and light fruits.  Body starts with a fizzy, sticky earthy caramel sweetness revealing some light fruity complexity and lots of warming alcohol toward the thinner finish.  Definitely not as good as I remember.

Batch #43 sampled on 1/18/04: Has a huge forthy, thick cream-colored head with large clumps of lace. Aroma has some light fruit, sugary caramel malt and a touch of alcohol.  Tastes fairly complex, but a little too sugary and not as balanced as the more aged editions.

Batch #22 sampled on 2/20/04: Pours a hazy light copper with a minimal thin ring of head.  Sweet oxidized caramel and toffee aroma.  Body is syrupy sweet and dry with some hop bitterness still present in the finish.  Good complexity and balance.  This has aged quite well Id say.   

Batch #36 sampled on 12/8/02: Wonderfully balanced sweet aroma.  Deep golden colored with tiny bubbles of carbonation.  Sweet, syrupy full mouthfeel with an initial alcohol bite, but a subdued finish.  Definite warming effect.  A great barley wine.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

Perhaps my memory is not so good, but my first sample of this was something like the best Belgian trippel Ive ever had.  I have sampled a more recent vintage and it is like a sparkling barleywine.  Almost equally good, but totally different.  I wont touch the rating.  But Im mystified.  Old:  I cant understand why they call this a barleywine.  Mine was more like a trappist ale.

I had the chance to try this after it was aged in oak, and it was great. Hair of the Dog is an amazing brewery. Rerate 9-6-3: How this manages to be so smooth, I'll never know. This surprises me because of how hoppy/alcohol filled it tastes. ReRate 4-04: I've had so much of this stuff, and every time it's great. Great fruitiness from this barleywine.

This gold-caramel colored ale pours with a light amount of carbonation and produces a modestly sized, thick cream-colored head that will lace your glass as you drink it down. When pouring, do so slowly and carefully to keep the yeast sediments at the bottom of the bottle from emptying into your glass. Now then, stick your nose into the glass. One whiff will fill your sinuses and senses with honey and hops.

3064,"2001-12-09",3.9,"I must admit I was pretty sh*tty when I tried this after a night of sampling various others(of which I lost the bottles somewhere). That said, I found this distinct in all the previously described characteristics. High alcohol is the most significant note. Under that I found it sweet, dried fruity and spicy, with enough hops to carry it to a dry finish. Not what I expected in an American barley wine(Spody Ody).","Mt.Prospect, Illinois, USA","Drew Blood"
3064,"2001-11-03",4.7,"A very strong ale.  Alchy is apparant.  Nice aroma and mouth feel.  Bitter aftertaste.","Laramie, Wyoming, USA","Dragon99"
3064,"2001-10-15",5.0,"Hair of the dog rules!  I drank two of these, and could hardly stumble home.","Albany, Oregon, USA","amceachern99"
3064,"2001-09-18",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 11, 2009 A very tasty and enjoyable beer.  Warming to the body and great for the soul.  A beer aficionados dream come true!  What an amzing head!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3064,"2001-09-12",3.8,"Great apple/floral aroma. Reminded me of spring in an orchard if that doesnt sound too sappy. Good thick head. The flavor was maybe a bit too alcoholic but evened out as it warmed. A great late-night beer.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Jake Barnes"
3064,"2001-09-01",4.7,"Absolutely wonderful beer.  Soft mouthfeel and smooth texture.  Dark fruity taste, plums.  I may have had it a bit too warm, try this beer lightly chilled.  For ten percent alcohol (my bottle said ten not 11.5) this is a killer brew.","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","daboskabouter"
3064,"2001-08-09",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 12, 2011   Strong fruity malt aroma. Still very smooth, but very powerful at the same time. An excellent barleywine overall, with sweet caramel and toffee malts above a spicy hop backbone, turning into a blast of alcohol at the end. Long finish.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
3064,"2001-07-08",5.0,"I have to give this beer a perfect rating.  Its like Thomas Hardy meets Bigfoot is the only way to describe this beautiful brew.","Portsmouth, New Hampshire, USA","rosebud"
3064,"2001-03-22",4.2,"Smooth and drinkable like an English barleywine, but complex and hoppy like an American.  Attractive cloudy appearance and the alcohol is nicely concealed by the flavors.  A great beer, from a spectacular brewery.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
3064,"2001-03-06",3.1,"Rich,cidery aroma.Cloudy,reddish tan. Initially thick with a slightly bitter maltiness. Almost dessert like as it warms your palatte.Gotta like the alcohol content.","Lancaster, California, USA","weeicemon"
3064,"2000-10-03",4.0,"Thought it was a little strong at first.  It got better as I drank it.
The last swallow was perfection.  Sweet undertaste.
Potent little beer, though.","St. Johns, Newfoundland, CANADA","shorlin"
3064,"2000-06-30",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2004 Aromatic, smooth barley wine, with signature HOTD flowery notes, a rich malty base, and a lively disposition.  Age it and it gets heavier, perhaps a little too heavy in its maltiness.  A rare barley wine to be consumed fresh.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
