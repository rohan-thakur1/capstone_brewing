4194,"2017-04-16",3.4,"Seeing the name spelled out, Im now a little worried this was brewed with laxatives... Pours a brown color with a thin white head. Aroma is chocolate, caramel, and toffee malts, with some metallic notes - Im not sure if this is from the beer itself or the can. Flavor is sweet chocolate and cola, with caramel, toffee, vanilla, and some roast - the metallic notes are gone from the flavor. Has some carbonation and a medium body. Pretty good. Would definitely be better without the metallic notes, but even then has a bit too much cola in it.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","chucklemation"
4194,"2017-04-13",3.6,"12 oz can. Pours clear brown with an off-white head. Cocoa aroma, molasses, touch roasty. Silky chocolate flavor, molasses, touch of coffee and roastiness. Some creamy sweetness to it. On the lighter side, but very tasty. Im a fan.","Northville, Michigan, USA","flatmatt"
4194,"2017-04-07",3.4,"Sample at Perrin on 3/31/17. Pours dark red with a thick beige head. Aroma of chocolate, malt and roast. Malty and chocolatey flavor with a slightly roasty finish.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
4194,"2017-03-11",4.0,"Nice dark pour with some lacing and a bit of head. Malt aromas with a hint of coffee and chocolate. Flavor matches the aroma with a nice touch of bitterness in the aftertaste. Smooth and enjoyable without being overly heavy.","Michigan, USA","Aggie80"
4194,"2017-02-26",3.2,"Pour from a 12oz can. Clear cola colored brew with small tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of chocolate, sweet malt, a few metallic notes. The cocoa adjuncts are apparent in the taste - sweet malt up front, transitioning to chocolate and ending with even more chocolate. Chocolate of the more bitter / dark variety though the brew does not lack for sweetness. Very low carbonation takes the zest out of the palate. Its OK.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","Onslow"
4194,"2017-02-24",3.7,"Tap at Clubhouse BFD. Pours chestnut, tan head. Aroma is cherry, fig, raisin, plum, chocolate, caramel, and roasted malt. Flavor is chocolate, plum, fig, little metallic, toffee, sweet finish. Good. I like it.","New York, USA","SG111"
4194,"2017-02-14",3.7,"Aroma is cocoa powder, bready, nutty, roasted malt, dark chocolate, caramel. Appearance is brown red, clear, light tan head. Taste is chocolate, bread, nuts, roasted malt, caramel, metallic, good. Mouthfeel is light to medium body, light crisp carbonation, bready chocolate metallic aftertaste. Overall, this exceeds expectations by being pretty tasty.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"

4194,"2017-01-27",4.1,"12 ounce can into tulip glass; no can dating, but is a recent release. Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toasted brown bread, nuttiness, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, chocolate/cocoa, and light earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toasted brown bread, nuttiness, herbal, light pepper, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light herbal/spicy hop and cocoa/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toasted brown bread, nuttiness, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, chocolate/cocoa, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great roast/hop bitter/sweet balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors; with zero yeast notes present. Light dryness from lingering hop/roast bitterness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.8%. Overall this is an excellent flavored traditional bock! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, chocolate/cocoa, and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink. Very rich and complex on malts for the ABV; with balanced chocolate/cocoa flavors. A really enjoyable and delicious offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
