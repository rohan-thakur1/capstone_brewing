4096,"2014-08-10",3.6,"The raw material of the De Cam products, available from tap in their pub and given in stone jars, as was custom for flat lambic two centuries ago. Made from wort coming from Girardin and 3 Fonteinen, apparently. A refreshing, fruity lambic, obviously without head or carbonation, with spicy and milky notes and bitter, thirst-quenching finish. Its a shame flat lambic has been reduced to folklore and has to be artificially kept alive, I could have this - or any other one - any day.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

4096,"2011-07-31",3.7,"On tap at the blender. It pours slightly unclear, golden in color and without head. Vinegar, lemon, leather and some barnyard in the aroma. The flavor is slightly vinegar-ish, with a caramel flavor tending towards butterscotch in the end. That probably doesnt sound too good, but it was a really nice lambic, especially the aroma. Its dry, tart and flat on the palate. Certainly a beer Id like to have more of. 110501","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

4096,"2007-04-25",4.0,"A Mes rate: 
From the barrel at the brewery during the Toer de Geuze. Wow. Easily the best young lambic I have had. Would be interested to know exactly how old this was as it already had some character of something quite a bit older. Lovely amber golden hue. Sandalwood already in the nose and something that I can only describe as reminding me of being on a beach. (Does Cosmo Kramer work for De Cam?) Citric flavour with apple and white wine but again there are the notes of something older, straw, hay and barnyardy funk mask its young age. Mouthfeel is excellent, almost worth a 5. Although it is flat it has a lovely soft carbed feel due to a creeping dryness round the edges. Very very good young lambic with bags of character.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
4096,"2006-06-27",3.7,"Draught. Bright, foggy, orange coloured body with a bubbly white ring of head. The aroma is really piney, bretty barnyard, and well funkified - its a tear jerker straight out of the gates. Bready biscuity backing with fruity tartness and a decent amount of wheat. Nice.

4096,"2004-09-03",3.9,"Very vinous aroma, grapes. The whine character comes back in the flavor, but is followed by a strong oaky flavor. Not very sour, but with citric notes. Grapes and oak aftertaste. Not the best lambic  in the world, still very good.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
4096,"2004-05-30",4.2,"Hazy body.  Amber-orange colour.  No head.  Nose of wine, grapes and flowers.  Lightly sweet, lightly acidic initial flavour which is very fruity.  Lightly sweet finish.  According to me, this is a superb lambiek.  As a matter of fact, I do not think this needs a lot of blending, pour it into bottles and deliver us a magnificent product!","Aarschot, BELGIUM","diabel"
4096,"2003-05-24",3.6,"Hazy amber-orange. No head. Winey, lactic, strange breath-taking sweetish smell. Taste is sweet, vineous, with immediate retronasal lemon/citrus-like acidity, liqueurish without alcohol. Dry-effect, acid-burn is there but compared to some others, low. Better filled palate than some lambics. Nice, but very unusual lambic. I wonder where this milk-sweetness derives from.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
