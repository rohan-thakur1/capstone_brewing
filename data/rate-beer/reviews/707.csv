707,"2017-06-20",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 20, 2017 Bottle. Dark brown bronze color. Aroma of fruity whisky, vanilla, rye, ripe fruit, raisin, figs and caramel. Taste has ripe fruit, spicey rye, caramel, raisin, oaky vanilla, whisky booze and a somewhat sharp alcoholic finish. Lots of flavors, the combination is a bit weird. Seems a bit off, but only compared to the high standard these pohjala ba?s have.","NETHERLANDS","MarcoDL"

707,"2017-06-08",4.4,"Bottled. 15cl sample. The aroma has caramel, bit raisin, rye, touch of bourbon/oak/vanilla. Bit hazy, reddish brown coloured beer with a thin, off-white head. The taste has malty sweetness (caramel/rye), bourbon, woody tones, molasses. Complex, balanced, even at this young age. Truely a great achievement. Bonus points for 70% rye brewing ffs. Masterpiece.","Baarn, NETHERLANDS","skortila"

707,"2017-05-30",4.2,"Pours dark brown, not transparent at all and almost no foam - nor carbonation for that matter. Sweet and slightly boozy-caramelly nose, spices, burnt sugar and sweet black bread liquid. Vanilla and a bit of oak from the whiskey barrel. Taste is smooth and creamy. Thick with bread character that is being followed with slightly boozy vanilla ice cream, complete with rye bread crumbs, fried in butter with caramelised sugar. Booze and rye spices contributibg to bitterish sweet and spicy finish where burnt black bread pudding just lingers. Its a definite treat and salute to the spirit of a challenger, 70% rye beer sounds impossible but Põhjala did it!","ESTONIA","jinroh"
707,"2017-05-28",4.2,"Bottle. Batch 427; BB 24.04.2020. Mahogany with ruby glare, tight but brief head, drops to nothing (some swirling and its back - yellowy beige). Superb aroma and flavour, sweet, caramelly, considerably rye spicy, perhaps a woody hint but not much rye whisky. The aroma especially is intoxicating. Soft, heavy, sticky. Not boozy but a nice coat of warmth (nearing heat later on) in the throat and roof of mouth. Carbonation present but very modest and fine. This is awesome. Wish I could get a couple more bottles to open in coming years.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Kauge"

707,"2017-05-15",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 22, 2017 Bottle (from Tallinna Kaubamaja). Pours dark ruby with beige head. The head stay. Aroma is sweet, rye, bit buttery (but not diacetyl), malt, caramel. Flavor is sweet and bitter, massive rye, booze, malt, caramel, condensed milk. Finish is boozy and rye bitter. Overall: love the nose. love the rye, but flavor is way over the top and booze kick is not nice. 3+ rating feels like overrate for the bottle, since Im struggling to drink it, but I did love the aroma and it looks nice, so they are what they are. I had it also at TCBW and remember that keg was better. Will update once I got there with my backlog, so this may go up. 9:5:5:3:11=3.3

Despite the score, for me this tastes something that I will likely enjoy a lot more after a couple of years. Will buy a couple of bottles to see.
 tap at TCBW: a lot more enjoyable as a small sample. 8:4:8:4:15=3.9","Tallinn, ESTONIA","martjoobolut"

707,"2017-05-15",4.4,"Bottle. Nice minimalist label design, cap with green wax cover.
Very dark, reddish brown liquid with thin, beige head. Medium carbonisation.
Aroma - dark roasted bread, caramel, dark rasins, vanilla pods, blackcurrants and malts.
Taste - sweet malts, bitter, roasted and slightly burnt bread, caramel syrup, and black rasins. A lot of bread in the taste with some sourness. 
Aftertaste - dark rye bread with honey.
Very well balanced brew, alcohol is barely detectable. Delicious.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","CaskSensei25"
707,"2017-05-14",3.5,"KeyKeg (TCBW2017) (7:4:7:4-:13=3.5-)
Sweet roasty aroma, toffee. Damn dark, tight cream-coloured head settles to a ring. Full palate, moderate carbonation. Sweet toasty taste, raisins, chocolate, vanilla, and signs of barrels. Finish fades that out nicely. Curiously drinkable for something so sweet and strong, the alcohol is skillfully subdued. Right from the start the aroma warns you its going to be a heavy beer, and very sweet, but it turns out to be not as over-powering as you first think it might be.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

Alcohol, sweet, raisins, caramel, toffee in taste. Sweet, dark fruits in aftertaste. Tiny bit of rye roughness and corners mixed with alcohol in mouthfeel.
