3835,"2017-03-06",3.5,"Enjoyed at a tasting at Toms last night. 500 mL bottle. This baby slowly filled the bottle, and then overflowed. Constantly, until half of the bottle was poured, then the head receded in the bottle. The pour is a cloudy golden yellow with a large off white head that falls down slowly with a hefty lace left behind. The aroma is strange. There is a fair bit of fruitiness here, but I dont know if thats just from the wine barrel that was used. Its just faint. The There is a light tropical fruit and a heavy funkiness. Its also got a light woodiness thats throwing me off. The flavor is strong funk, light oak, and a hint of tropical fruits and blueberry. Its definitely more prevalent than the nose. The mouth feel is light and clean with a softer carbonation and a lingeringly funky and dry finish. I think this one needed to be fresh.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3835,"2015-06-16",4.0,"Stillbow Oxtisanal, 6.5%
Bottle, courtesy of the Oxbow owner, Tom Adams (?), thanks a lot mate!. Its an unclear, orange colored beer with a dense, small, off-white to light beige colored head. The aroma has a lovely barrel touch, funky orange notes, hints of berries, a hint of lemon and leather, some pale malts and a generic fruity sweetness. Its not sweet on the palate though, its quite dry actually and lightly tart, with a high but nice level of carbonation and a medium to full body. Theres a good dash of fresh orange in the flavor, a vague hint of blueberry and citrus peel, some grass and pale malts and also some tannins. Some lemon and a faint leathery, barnyardish touch as well. Lasting finish with orange and a touch of blueberries and barrel and funk. A really lovely beer, proving that a blend of orange and blueberry can be very nice, and with all the other flavors and aromas added it sure ends up as a wonderful beer. Easy drinkable, tasteful and refreshing. 150613","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

3835,"2013-12-23",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Citrusy fruitiness with fieldberry angles add disctinction to this tart and fluffy Barrel-Aged Saison.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam covers the cloudy hay blond.
-The blueberry wine touch morphs into white grape fruitiness quite quickly.
-A touch of green wood peers through in the second half.
-This is very drinkable and the level of rusticity is clear but polite.
-The barrel character does not take over here, which is highly appreciated. Nice dosage which creates uniqueness.
