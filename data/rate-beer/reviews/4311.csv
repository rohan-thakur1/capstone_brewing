The aroma is is full of caramel malt with a nice light sweetness that comes off a little fruity. Malt and caramel are really on the forefront here. Pretty basic though. The flavor is pretty bitter up front. There is a lot of toasted malt and a little bit of a metallic tendency. The fruits are subdued and the bitterness and the malt comes through pretty solidly.

4311,"2014-06-09",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2017 Original 09/06/14
Bottle, 500 ml. Pours deep, slightly cloudy ruby with a minimal amount of light tan head. Big caramel malt presence in the aroma, backed up by some fruiter notes (dark fruits and citrus) and a bit of breadiness and honey. Taste of roasted malts, salted caramel, bread, dark fruits, apple, citrus (tart-esque) and some grassy hop notes. Quite sweet as a result but this is balanced well by bitterness from both the roasted malts and the hops. Carbonation is moderate and the beer has a medium to full body, so this has quite a bit of weight to it. Combined with noticeable alcohol, this does not make for easy drinking, but the flavour is extremely rich and full so that is scarcely an issue. Very impressed. 

Update 06/04/17
Head is longer lasting and lacing is thicker than previously noted; fair bit of visible carb (medium sized bubbles) Like this one even more these days now that Ive got a regular supply again; noticing some subtler sweet and spicy notes in the aroma now; muscavado, candied sugar, clove, allspice, cinnamon, candied orange and dried dark fruits, dark rye bread and hint of almost roasted malt coming through right at the back. Theres a dry, earthen twinge to the taste I didnt notice before, which balances out the sweeter notes. Also more spices here including clove, nutmeg, and tingly black pepper in the long, drying, mildly bitter finish. Not as much booze as previously thought. Almost grainy tasting/feeling. Silky smooth with a subtle tickle of carbonation. Just a truly fantastic beer.","Kent, ENGLAND","Cybion"

Clear reddish brown colour with trace of dirt-like yeast sediments; Two and a half finger head and crumpety off-white foam which last for 2 minutes; Excellent sticky lacing and active carbonation; Very fragrant aroma of sweet roasted malt, caramel, toffee, fruit cake, and grass; Pleasant, mid to light sweet taste of roasted malt, with burnt caramel, light liquorices, leather, spice, bitter lime and grass; Medium body and oily palate; Taste profile is initially sweet roasted malt with strong, colourful bite of herbal grassy hops in the background, accompanied by leathery yeast and notes of dark chocolates. Exotic! Hop bitterness is expressive, more like bites but never overbearing, with lingering and right dose of astringency to finish; Pretty dry after taste, pleasant and tempting to mouth.

Comments: This is absolutely an sensual opener. Just when I thought it may be an upped version of the fruity Old Winter Ale, its looks, smell and taste has characters all of its own - excellent head and lacing, sweet roast malt-driven aroma and taste, and a very lovely, exotic spiciness and hoppiness which can only be fully appreciated via nose and taste, not words.

Also a good choise for every-day drinking, like ESB. If ESB is a light IPA, 1845 is a light, fruity barley wine...","Budapest, HUNGARY","Thomasalias"

4311,"2012-03-29",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2012 Pours golden, clear. Initial aroma is malty, with subtle complexities of toasted malt, nuts, bread, maybe a little dried fruit, but its not at all sweet. The hop presence is very evident but it mostly balances out the malt, even though it lingers slightly at the finish. Overall, I find this to be one the best English strong ale Ive had. I dont think it stacks up better than many of the micro-brewed American strong ales, but it certainly has it place in the mix. Its worth trying now and then.

Update: June 2012, cellared bottle, 15 months old. Still essentially the same beer. Perhaps more roasted notes coming through at the expense of other malt flavors. Hops still very balancing and evident, and there is a mild lingering hop bitterness at the finish. Not sure if this will improve or not. So far cellaring is not making a big difference.","Bothell, Washington, USA","michaelinwa"

On the nose, there are notes of toasted malts, biscuit, pale malts and Goldings, along with a delicate Christmas spice, candied fruit and a touch of dough. The flavour is slightly dry up front and becomes more so towards the end. Throughout, there are notes of candied fruit, nutmeg and molasses. Hops become more prominent towards the finish, which is long and dry, with hops, nutmeg and spice. On the palate, it is full in body with a smooth, creamy texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice English strong ale. It is drier than I expected, but is still appropriately malt-forward.

The aroma is too sweet, alcoholic, and even ripe at first, making for a rather mixed first impression, but as it mellows out with temperature, it gets sweeter in a much more elegant and complex kind of way, with dried fruits, nuts and loads of caramel coming out, and the malt backbone taking more of a supporting role. The beer pours a beautiful brown and develops a medium head, but it doesnt keep it for too long. The taste is wonderful, with the bread character of the malts really coming through.

Also, got some hints of a buttery note combined with some fruit in the nature of grapes and dried raisin and plums.  Picking up some bread or biscuit malts also.  A lot going on here.  The taste shows the dry breadiness with an alcohol punch.  The fruit sweetens the dryness.  Tastes a bit like a fruit cake.  No bitterness to speak of.  Seems pretty well balanced.  Medium mouthfeel.  Dry and smooth.  Covers the palate decently with a bit of the alcohol warmth.  This beer is pretty good.

Aroma is pleasant, hops are most upfront, followed by an underflying fruitiness. Of course tasty malts are present. Anyway, the taste of this beer is one reminiscent of many IPAs. Hops are a strong force, especially for a British beer, but are very well balanced with the malts. Nicely bitter, but exactly enough that it doesnt impede repeated sips.

T: A nice, brisk hop presence; slightly herbal and earthy. Very nice caramel malt in the background, with a mild amount of spice. Slightly sweet. Still having trouble identifying the specific spicing--perhaps the orange marmalade I detected in the nose.. Mild hints of tobacco and a very slight green apple skin presence. 

M: Medium bodied with a moderate, brisk carbonation. No detectable alcohol presence. Chewy and biscuity.

D: Although certainly not within the English definition of sessionable, this is one incredibly drinkable brew. Nice balance between earthy hops, fruity esters, and caramel malt.

4311,"2010-08-01",3.8,"She comes in a brown bottle whose cap pops in giddy delight as I take in the sights. Hazy browns under a soft khaki head wink seductively while her head proudly sports a ringlet of delicate bubbles. Treacle, that English sugar concoction for which an inordinate amount of people have no idea what it smells like or tastes like is there in proud standing. Keeping her company are fresh red apples, cinnamon-raisin toast right out of the oven, toffee, and dry nuts in the finish. A breeze of straw and baled hay flitters in the background as a subtle afterthought. I am duly impressed, but I figured I would be. Taking in her aromatics, I dive right into her liquid bounty for a sweet kiss up front with her malt dominating a goodly portion of my first impressions. Grass, straw, and baled hay provide a bitter-dry undercurrent while toffee crunchies and treacle coat my lips and soothe my palate. Her toffee profile is prominent in the middle and back, with a heavier mouthfeel than I was initially expecting. Apples and pears are ripe for the eating, and as I bite through crisp skins, their sweet juices trickle down my throat, melding perfectly with the toffee and treacle for an interesting take on fall candied fruit goodness. Raisin bread adds to her chewy mouthfeel while bitter nuts sneak into her finish; almonds come to mind. Separately her menagerie of flavors would have been a jumble mess, but her palate melded each flavor together in seamless quaffing enjoyment. Where one ended, another one was already beginning, and before I knew it, another flavor was already there making merry and keeping the party going. Well played, and an excellent example of a classic English bottle-conditioned ale that is thankfully easy to find.


Fullers was one of my gateway breweries back in the day. I enjoy them now as I did then, though with a bit more of a critical eye.

I really should have let it warm more before uncapping it, but I just bought it from the grocery store where it was chilled and Im saving the ESB for tomorrow or the next day. Ill sip it slowly. The smell is sweet caramel malt with hops that are very close to just how I picture English hops, refined and bitter. The flavor really brings out a delicious balance of flavors. Its a strong bitter, almost like a weak Old Ale. Lots of big malt notes dominate the palate but the whole package is well-balanced.

A - Deep red-orange amber color. Decent sized, bubbly and foamy head that is a light beige ivory color. A little below average retention with almost no lacing left.

S - Good amount of toasted caramel malt, as well as some bready smell. Also some general fruitiness with apple and some orange being the strongest.

T - A lot of bready malt taste with some caramel and grain taste too. Some earthy hops along with a bit of floral hops as well. Also a fair amount of gold fruit (good amount of apple and orange).

D - Easy to drink with great mouthfeel that goes down easy. Rich and full flavors with a good balance of malt/bread taste and some hop/fruity tang.

4311,"2009-02-23",3.9,"So, rating this beer requires that I make a distinction between the bold punch of flavors that characterize the American Ale category, and the balanced subtle charachter of the english and scotish ales.  Fullers did a brilliant job.  The aroma is muted, but wafts of sweet bread and figgy pudding.  It pours into my tulip beer glass with a deep red-amber hue, and a think, frothy head.  The head persists throughout the drinking of the beer, and laces the glass nicely.  Flavor is sweet spices and Christmas.  Very nice sweet up front, and a balanced smoothness down the hatch.  The mouthfeel is exactly as expected, full rich filling, but not milkshake.  As this ale is bottle conditioned, the carbonation is soft.  This beer got better as it warmed in the glass.

In the mouth, it is full and malty without being cloying or overly sweet, and each mouthful serves up complex tannic, leathery bitterness with an interesting grassy breath to the finish. A delicious light sourness closes out the gulp, inviting another (and many more). Excellent.","Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC","evanrail"
4311,"2009-02-01",3.8,"In short: An exemplary English Strong Ale.  Big but smooth fruity maltiness, almost no hops presence and highly drinkable.  Very good
How: Bottle.  Consumed relatively fresh two months after purchase
The look: Clear amber-ruby body topped by a medium beige head
In long: As with most typical English strong ale this beer is all malts with little hops presence.  Toffee, caramel, dark fruits (raisins, figs, etc.), molasses, grape juice, wild berries, etc.  Finish is all fruits with almost no bitterness.  Despite the little hops presence the beer doesnt feel really sweet.  This is a rich and smooth English strong ale.  Nothing original but this beer is highly drinkable.  Body is unexpectedly thin yet the beer feels really nourishing.  First brewed in 1995 for the 150th anniversary of the brewery reminding us that the English have been brewing good beers for over 150 years but have yet to learn to cook a half-decent meal.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Pours with a frothy, three finger thick, light tan colored head that leaves a light, layered lace pattern as it slowly recedes.  The beer is a dark amber color, but shows a brilliantly clear, ruby-amber color when held up to the light.  Slightly earthy hop notes, ample marmalade aromatics, with a deep, rich, yet secondary to the hop, malt character.  The hop notes get a touch metallic towards the end, but if you dig around a bit a substantial malt character kicks in that contributes aromas of fresh baked soda crackers, hearty bread notes and toasty grain aromatics.  Running throughout is a sweet, caramelized malt backbone that provides aroma of toffee and some berry notes. The last being accented by the hop notes as well.  This has a really nice mix of malt and hop character, while it is initially hop dominated, the malt character is substantial and at times even overtakes the hop character in its depth.

Sweet and then frothy, the beer is a bit too carbonated, but this is a much better thing than being under carbonated as a quick swirl releases the excess.  Equal matched notes of mixed berries and marmalade provide a fruity start and middle to this beer that is offset by sharp, lightly herbal hop notes, a touch of sweet spice and a mild, though contributing, balance-necessary, bitterness.  The finish has both this hop character as well as a dry, toasty grain note and a fresh baked, yet well fermented bread flavor.  Wow, as this warms up a bit, it starts to pick up some significantly darkened grain notes, certainly not roasted, but it is significantly toasted in its flavor.  The amber malt, really distinctly adds to the finish of this beer; it dries the finish out and provides an amped up, well browned, bread crust flavor to this brew.

This has a really nice hop character to it; this seems to be an evolution of the Fullers ESB.  I like that the hop character is a mix of marmalade and fruit notes coupled with a nice green, herbal note, all the while accented by sweet grain and ultimately offset by hop bitterness and interesting, substantial toasted malt notes in the finish.  While not as strong as I was thinking it would be, this is certainly quite drinkable, which more than makes up for that.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, medium red with a small, creamy, off-white head that mostly diminished but left good lacing. The aroma was light to moderate malt, light to moderate herbal hops, lightly yeasty with sweet fruit. Nice but weak. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and lightly bitter and acidic, while the finish was moderately sweet, lightly acidic and moderately to heavily bitter with and average duration. The flavor was a little malty with a little fruitiness that switches to herbal hops in the finish. Nice balance but seems a little watered down.

4311,"2007-11-10",4.2,"This was a birthday gift to myself; Id heard how good this was and was anxious to try it. I wasnt disappointed.
The bottle and label are simple and very handsome, in a traditional English style. It poured with a thin but pretty off-white head that left fair lacing. The color was a lovely reddish copper-amber. The aroma was rich and quite strong, with obvious hop bitterness and some sweet, fruity notes beneath. The frutiness comes through more strongly from the bottle than a glass. The flavor was even richer than the aroma, quite bitter and just on the edge of too hoppy for me, but with each sip more of the smokiness and malt came through. It was a real challenge to my low-hops tastebuds, but it really grew on me. The tail was pretty smooth, with a noticeable but pleasant bitterness at the end. The alcohol kick is strong. In fact, this is a strong beer in every sense. That very strength can be a bit overwhelming, and I am not sure that I really like it as well as the Fullers ESB. But this is a great beer nonetheless, even if one a night is all I could handle. Another triumph by Fullers.","USA","Allie"

Flav.:  More brown sugar, deep caramel and toffee and less fruit than the nose, still some molasses and slightly minty herbal notes, a bit of earthy hops; a little sweet with some bitterness; leaves a light burnt sugar finish.

Still nice stuff.","Nepean, Ontario, CANADA","probstblueribbon"

4311,"2007-09-24",4.0,"Pours rich dark copper/red with a beige head. Big malty caramel flavor, hints of chooclate, sweet cherry, damp wood, and spices. Light oxidatized flavors only lead to complexity, not distracting at all. Sherry and chocolate show in the finish. While thinner then expected on the palate, the depth of flavors really makes up for it. Chewy dates and light nutmeg begin to show as the beer warms.

4311,"2007-09-19",3.8,"Probably one of the tastiest aromas ever: port, spiced rum, dark fruits with malts showing slimly underneath; pours a nice shade of ruby, slight off white head that slims down to a fine sheen and lengthy lacing.  Only place this one misses is on the palate; seems a little too thin, and all the tasty aromas dont quite translate on the tongue.  Nicely hopped though, with a lengthy bitter finish.  Similar to Moonraker, though not quite as untamed.  Over all, a nice brew.","USA","ElGaucho56"
4311,"2007-09-18",4.2,"500 ml bottle - pours a gorgeous plum tone with a tight sticky off-white cap.  Big bright Goldings aroma, along with a subtle spice and some dates.  Very soft in the mouth - probably the closest a bottled product will ever come to cask-feel.  Beautifully subtle flavours of brown sugar, fresh prunes and a dry, grassy, bitter hop finish that lasts for a long time.  A touch of alcohol warms the back of the throat.  A masterful concoction, and one that I want to drink lots of.","Parkdale, Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","VeloVampire"

Aroma is moderate in strength and illuminates raisins, malts, almonds, anise and toffee. Flavor pretty much mirrors the aroma. Mouthfeel is a touch thin up front but rounds out to a nice satisfying fullness, the carbonation is  light but adequate.

Taste: Heres my take on 1845 (the beer): Initially sweetish, with hints of caramel and butterscotch. Also, its got some notable biscuit flavors. Plus, its got some fruitiness (cherries, for me)! Doubleplus, theres some spicy, bitter hops in the finish. All in all, theres alot going for this beer and alot going on IN this beer.

Served cold, needed a long cuddle to warm it up. Very deep reddy brown, small tight persistent head. Sweet fruity malts, even when its cold, plums and raisins. Soft in the mouth, some tang of bitterness hits the side of the tongue very quickly. Soon after that, a winey aroma goes up the nose. On swallowing, a huge wave of nutty and roast malts fills the mouth. Dark resinous sticky hops bitter up the mouth and leave a lovely long dry bitter finish. Incredible brew.

Classic English Strong Ale - delicious. Rich nutty brown colour, wonderfully soft but full fruity and spicy aroma.

Classy, restrained bitterness and a firm mouthfeel, but not overly crisp.  Full dry body, hearty undercurrents of flavor, tons of malt.  Touch of warming from the otherwise undetectable alcohol.

Aromas are fairly high-toned and very clean, featuring toast and almonds.

Medium-heavy body, with moderately low carbonation. Sweetness is just hinted at. Flavors are a restrained combination of fruit and both roasted and unroasted malt. The malt here is malty, not sweet - nice! Chewing emphasizes the fruit component. Finishes long and slightly bitter, just enough to cleanse the palate and beckon another sip. However, theres also a suggestion of alcoholic heat and heaviness that hampers the drinkability.

I love how this beer can manage to be fruity and malty without being sweet; even more remarkably, it manages this feat without showing any overt hoppiness!  But Im dissappointed in the alcohol showing...after all, the ABV is only 6.3%.  I wont be keeping this in my rotation due to that flaw.","USA","tcfishler"

A roasty, slightly hoppy, bread crusty backtaste; Palate on the whole was kind of average and the alcohol left a slight sting...strange for just a 6.3 ABV.

4311,"2006-08-19",3.7,"500 mL Bottle. Aroma plunges forth into the vapid air, with a pungent blast of oats, grain and fruit earth. Berry bushes bloom, wheat ripens, and my grandmother makes caramel with grapefruit juice. Sweet and seductive. Light lemony edges indicating possible hop presence. Volatile and lightly hot, which is surprising for the percentage. Stunning clear pour of ruddied candied apple caramel with fringes of fire and gold. Rim of silky white cashmere strings. Flavor is a rich, yet somewhat thin around the edges, run of malt sugars and caramels. Fruit sugars, of plum and cherry slide down a waterfall of cream, with handfulls of barley husks and leeching Kent Goldings. Im finding the hops out of balance here actually. They come on too soon and too dry. I will admit my palate has been sensitive to bitter lately, but this still seems out of range. The body is a little watery and reminds me of the bottom of a gin and tonic with lemon, with only a dram seeping through the ice cubes, thus coming out less potent. At the smack, grassy notes prevail. I can really feel out the Kent Goldings, with astonishing breadth, but I can almost feel that planty texture and its a little upsetting. Some far away sherry notes are first on the tongue. In the background a light wash of roast. Plum stems and apricot skins smack. Decent, but hopfully unbalanced and a little thin bodied in my perception.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

4311,"2006-05-31",3.9,"(500 ml bottle: $3.99 at BevMo in La Jolla, CA) Ive let this age in my darkened, cool bedroom for many months, long enough that Ive exceeded the supposed Best By date of 06-Jan-06 by four months.  No matter, this flavorful English ale is delicious.  Malty, roasty, chocolaty, and lightly smoky, but balanced by a moderate hop bitterness that makes its presence known in the crisp finish and then remains on the palate for the rest of the session.  For an English beer thats seen this much aging, Im pretty impressed by how much bite the hops has retained.  While the malty and chocolaty nose is reasonably aromatic, it really doesnt compare to the flavor, not even in enjoyment.  Medium-full bodied with a nice, round mouthfeel and playful carbonation.  Dark amber in color and fairly cloudy, but there is still a good amount of muddy sediment remaining in the bottle.  The tall, beige head shows exceptional retention, never dipping below a quarter inch, and it deposits a thick, dense blanket of foamy lace on the glass.  There used to be a time when I didnt care for this beer (okay, it was relatively soon after I started drinking ""good"" beer), so I havent bought any since then.

Aroma of malty sweetish, lightly spicey fullers beer. Taste is also malty sweetness, infact theres such a great malt content here i wonder how much malt they must use. Spicey and i get the dark fruits and spicey characters, but a bitterness which i thought may  have been due to it being a little to cold kicks in a bit at the end meaning its not above a 4. A good beer however i was expecting something a little more complex.","bantervile, Bedfordshire, ENGLAND","DonMagi"

4311,"2005-12-09",3.7,"Bottle. Let me first say that I dont like this beer young; excessively hoppy and carbonated, which dominates the other flavors. However, with age, this is indeed great stuff. No up to the standards of their vintage ales, but still very good. Aged: Malty, brown sugar, toffee, dried currant, hint of orange peel and glacied fruit, and apple cider spice. More sweetness balanced by the right touch of hops. Not overwhelmingly complex, but still a great beer. Rating based on 2 years of age.","Illinois, USA","Philip"

Flavor is super malty, caramel and English toffee, pears with a twinge of alcohol. Finish heavy on the toffee, citrus, and light hop bitterness with stays around for awhile. Solid mouth feel with active carbonation; not harsh, but defiantly dances on the tongue if held too long. Surprisingly rich with all the maltiness, but bitter end throws me off. Less balanced and more, I  dunno, schizophrenic, but not in an extreme way. Enjoyable, but less hop in the Finish would have really made this one a winter beer of choice.

Poured into a pint glass (bottle, 19/10/05), cool and not cold. Deep garnet-amber body, the clarity of honey, with a big dense, creamy off-white head that left an abundance of lace down the glass as I sipped (possibly the most appealing pint of beer I have seen). Aroma of dried of fruits, resinous earthy hops, cocoa powder and dark chocolate, quite spicy and dry. Similarly dry and spicy in the mouth, quite homely, warming and malty . Head gets in the way of tasting it and added a creamy edge to the reasonably smooth mouth feel. Medium bodied and light in carbonation, it had a little noticeable yeast and alcohol spice that added to the complex balanced malty palate. Smoky grain, burnt sugars, brine ?, milk chocolate and a light amount of butterscotch (nothing detrimental) added to some otherwise undefinable characters of this lovely beer.

Original rating: 500 ml bottle conditioned, trade with maeib. Orange to brown colour, decent peachy to beige head. As Ive had many British ales with excellent aroma lately, I kind of expected the 1845 to be equally good. Its not, but that doesnt mean the aroma is bad either.

4311,"2005-05-20",5.0,"Wow! What can I say about such an incredible ale? It poured medium reddish mahogany and glistened under a thick foamy two-finger tan head, which slowly ebbed to a nice floating skim and crisp lacing all the way up the glass. The aromas were a complex blend of sweet fruit, raisins, prunes, citrus, apple, berries, warm meadow, cinnamon, spice, molasses, ginger, malt, yeast and esters. The taste is huge -- a big slam of dark toasted malt hits you first, followed by BIG hoppy bitterness. These big elements are well-tempered by a sweet fruitiness, almost honey-like. Theres just enough soft herbal character to make it interesting. It starts malty, goes all sweet and mushy in the middle, wakes you up with a whisper of yeast, then slaps you hard in the face with the magnificent hops for a head-shaking bitter finish, which fades to a lingering fruit aftertaste.

The nose is big and wine-like, with faint notes of lemon sherbet and dark chocolate. The palate is creamy, medium-bodied. The dominant flavours are chocolate and licorice. In fact, this reminds me of a British candy called Victory Vs - the black licorice ones. Wow, Im having a real Proustian moment here - suddenly Im 12 again. Havent seen those candies for years.

4311,"2005-01-03",3.4,"1/2/05.  Poured out of 500 mL bottle, obtained in SecretSanta exchange on RateBeer 12/14/04.  Lightly hazy caramel red-orange in color with a fluffy, somewhat rocky, nicely lasting cream-tan head good lacing with excellent stickiness.  Somewhat mild aroma, sweet and malty like an amber ale or a sweet bock, lightly lagery character, hints of wood, dried fig and green raisin, and faint bitterness.  Taste has something like a lager yeast, fruitcake, touches of roasted amber malt and toast, forward hoppy bitterness.  A bit too simple, but its got a nice, refreshing crispness.  Medium-thin, somewhat watery mouthfeel with very long carbonation lending a fluffy texture to match the peppery dirty bitterness.  Long and lean finish, growing in resonance with a nice dryness.  Even though its not that high in alcohol, its a bit harsh.  I dont think its even the alcohol lending that harshness, but the hop/malt combo.  Im really not a fan of the prominent bitterness in this beer, but I can tell its obviously a well-crafted brew nonetheless.

4311,"2004-10-02",3.7,"The large head is made of fine, yellowish foam that disappears slowly, building a fine, hard crater. The Colour is deep copper red; the liquid is a little hazy.

The smell of this ale is mild, pleasing and a little bit on the sweet side. There are some yeast and lots of malts. There are hints of that special, sour smell that bottle conditioning creates.

The first part of the taste is alcohol, but just for a short moment. Then, a fresh mix of sweet malts and mild hops appears, slowly increasing the bitterness into a dry, long and balanced aftertaste.

The carbon dioxide is conservative with small bubbles.

The taste is complex, yet I found it somewhat avoiding and hard to put my finger on its special character. I have to compare it with Fullers ESB, one of my favourite ales. And my conclusion is that 1845 is common ale with some extra alcohol, while ESB is ale with extra everything: More alcohol, more malt, more hops and more grit.","Linköping, SWEDEN","bark"

4311,"2004-07-26",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2011  Oct 2002 This is a big gun beer and delivers a massive impact. Making the most of all the ingredients Fullers manage to produce a beer that is more than the sum of all its parts. Intense malt, intense hops and intense alcohol all make their presence felt, yet remain at all times perfectly integrated. The Châteauneuf-du-Pape of beers. Truly world class. [3.9]
 April 2004  I would agree with what I said two years ago. This is one of the best bottle conditioned ales that us Brits make which is readily available. This fills the mouth with dark flavours. Yummy. [4.1] 
 July 2004  A taste comparison with Youngs London and Hens Tooth. There are some nutty notes from the crystal malt, while the amber malt adds a biscuit flavour with instant coffee undertones. There is also some chocolate. The orange marmalade flavours come from the single hop Goldings. Overall, this was the darker, more oaky flavoured of the three with some musty aged notes. [3.5]
Jan, 2005 The stale notes in the aroma are off-putting, but the creamy chocolate, buttery sweetness, bitter twigs of the flavour, and the dark, dark chocolate in the finish are so pleasing that its no wonder this is the best selling bottle conditioned beer in Britain. [4.0]
July, 2007  Wow. This is enjoyable. It sometimes happens that a certain blend of malts and a certain amount of hops comes together in a manner which is very pleasant. The hop bitterness is firm and tangy, yet not aggressive. The malts have soaked up the hops so there is an exquisite marriage of sweet and bitter, wrapped in a malty coat. The strength gives a chewy, solid, serious mouthfeel, without being too thick, and certainly not tasting of crude alcohol. There are few flaws in this.  Its not a beer, however, that totally sweeps me off my feet. Its sort of predictable and a little old fashioned. I am not a fan of Goldings, nor of Maris Otter. There are malts and hops that give a more interesting range of flavours. And I do like a beer with a touch of character or individuality which this doesnt quite have. But its still a damn enjoyable ale. [4.2]","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

Pours a beautiful deep red colour with a nice, lacey, yellow head.
Aroma is quite buttery with biscuits (or maybe fresh scones with butter - mmmm) with some fruitiness in the back and some nice enough maltiness.
Tastes malty, but not really that malty. I appreciate the fact that its not sickly sweet like a lot of English strong ales but this needs something else to make it interesting. Definite biscuity flavour (amber malt?) with a relatively strong bitterness.
Nice smooth body, relatively low carbonation.

Ive never really been on downs or moors, but thats what popped into mind; I hope they smell like this.  Add to that some toasty and tawny port aromas, and a bit of chocolate milk, and youve got the delicious smell of this beer.  Appearance: fizzy frothy head initially average to large, mostly diminishing, light brown; murky amber color in the glass.  The taste: malty, creamy, a bit bitting on the tounge (I wouldnt want to say acidic, since it wasnt mouth-watering; it was almost as if it were dry, while I still had a mouth full of beer).  There was a vague taste of ginger cookies blended with the bitter hops, which came out more strongly on the finish.  Somehow, there was sweetness on the back of my tounge (isnt it supposed to be up front?), which was a pleasant surprise.  I would rate this one higher, but the finish seemed just a little...off.

4311,"2004-05-26",4.2,"The beer was shipped stateside in a brown bottle with attractive labeling that has an old world charm to it.  There are some brief blurbs about the brewer on the back label, and a best before date (03/Jan/05 for this review bottle).  Despite being clearly marked as 6.3% ABV, the beer has slipped under the radar of the beer police and is readily available in Georgia.

The poured beer was deep red to amber in color with a ¼ inch thick short lived head.  Carbonation was medium intensity with very fine bubbles.  Despite being bottle conditioned, the beer was only slightly hazy with no visible yeast sediment.

The aroma was malty with the nose being dominated by oak, vanilla, and a hint of chocolate.  The hops are not dominant, but have a distinctive English profile to them.

The malts were present in the taste as well, with notes of toffee, cherry, raisins, and a wisp of smoke.  The previously invisible yeast made its presence known in the form of a dusty, cobwebby feel similar to the air in an old castle.  The hops were surprisingly bitter and biting, with a peppery spiciness to them.  This is the hoppiest English beer Ive had to date.  The overall taste reminded me a lot of Stone Arrogant Bastard, but was not as bold.

The mouthfeel was smooth like butter and made the beer slide down easily.  The only drawback in this department was a bit of watery body.

4311,"2004-03-28",3.5,"Thanks to 123456green for sending me a couple bottles of this Fullers ale! 
 Body shined bronze, but with edges of amber and a rocky kaki head. I was shocked with the intense hop presence here. Lasting caramel notes ring true, along side the woodsy oak like and floral hops. The thirst of hop actually became a bit astringent and overpowering here. Presented a little white pepper and black peppercorn, along side a musty humidor - cedar chest – spicy-like forwardness. The alcohol was upfront and BeanDip compared it to Aqua-Net hairspray. Maybe some time in the cellar would do this beer some justice.

4311,"2003-09-26",3.8,"Truly a perfect-looking beer, pouring a dark red/brown with an initially thick, creamy head that quickly dissipates.  Aroma is biscuity with some earthy hops.  The beer itself is one big toasted biscuit, with some caramel and perhaps a hint of dark fruit.  Very well-done.  I like the Vintage Ale (well, at least the 1999 version I tried), but this is easier drinking with the slight alcohol presence.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

4311,"2003-09-09",3.3,"UPDATED: FEB 11, 2008 Rerate: 11.02.08.  Clear, clean butterscotch hue topped with a large, frothy, mocha-coloured head.  The aroma begins sweaty, yeasty, and quickly picks up flinty and flowery elements.  It continues along with cookies, both baked and dough, and picks up some faint toffee as well.  Peaches, coconut and pears crawl out of the woodwork.  A thick slab of malt resides underneath, not drawing attention to itself.  Perhaps a little strong in the yeast and dough departments overall.  Big bready, caramel sweetness up front with a flinty tint to it.  Flowers are strong at mid-palate and beyond, flowing into a tangy, yeast finish that tends to the tea-like at times.  Lots of tea in the lingering aftertaste, sweetened with wildflower honey.  Medium to full bodied with a slick, acidic texture and moderate carbonation.  50cl bottle, bbe 23.10.09.

New score of 5/4/7/4/13 = 3.3.  Given the amount of time since my previous rating, the new rating fully replaces the old.  I still found the aroma underwhelming, but this time it was over yeasty as well.  The flavour was more on track, but no where near what I originally experienced.  Still, it does look good and feel alright.

50 cL bottle, pint glass, 55 degrees.  I had one of these the other night and it was great.  Now, to see how it stands up to a formal rating.  BTW, I dont know how a 6.3% ABV beer made it into Georgia, but Im happy it did.  Very large, off-white, frothy, fizzy, rocky head is well lasting and sits on a ruby-red to brown-orange body that is clear with lively carbonation.  Caramel, nutty, cookie malt is very rich (Heavy); pleasant flowery hops (Moderate); doughy yeast (Light); raisin, oak, honey, clove aromas.  Wouldve had a 10 if the aroma were a little stronger.  Heavily sweet, lightly bitter flavor becomes a moderately sweet, moderately bitter, lightly acidic (sour) finish.  Medium-heavy body, creamy texture, lively carbonation.  Theres a bunch of malt in here and I like it!  The bottom line is: I had to clean up dog puke halfway through this beer and it was still delicious.  Original rating 9, 5, 9, 4, 16 = 4.3.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

Yet now the bitterness has left my mouth and I have a very nice sweet nutty taste. Very nice colour(UK spelling) and smells great. Very drinkable and it has a nice flavor while its being drunk but the initial aftertaste is a turn off. I guess this is a much more high scale verson of bass ale.

Has a small lacey head of beige/light brown.
Begins somewhat sweet and I am thining, lots of fruit, but then out of nowhere, the body shifts gears and towards the finish I am tasting tons of hops.  This beer makes the Vintage Ale seem like a unbalanced mess in comparison.  This is supremely balanced, very soft and perhaps not as challenging, but magnificently flavored and balanced.  Tastes of cherries, oak, and has a nice deep dry hops flavor that comes out.  Alcohol flavor is hinted at and by no means dominant.  The initial taste has some zesty spices, not heavy, almost tending towards herbal/licorice, but sweeter and more caramel/candied.

Smell is all caramel; sweet and candied toffee aroma and loads of caramel with notes of slight dark fruit and fresh bread. Hint of alcohol late and deep.
Taste is super smooth caramel malt, subdued in its subtle sweetness, balanced in with the perfect amount of earthy hop twinged bite and bitterness, and slightly drying. The hops start to make a bigger appearance and gets more noticeable as you go. 
Feel is solid medium bodied, slightly buttery and chewy, all soothingly smooth with a nice calming earthy dryness in the finish. Lending this barleywine to be incredibly delicious and drinkable, very enjoyable and head swimmingly soothing.

Where the ESB hits you with its full chewy maltiness, the maltiness in this beer is more subdued and youre actually slammed by the bitterness the first couple of sips. As you get used to the bitterness, youll start to notice the sweet maltiness (although this is still more subdued than in the ESB) A little later especially after the beer warms up, youll start to notice some toffee notes starting to mix with the maltiness and slightly citric bitterness. I even noticed the occasional slight hint of banana, but Im not sure if I wasnt just tasting things.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
4311,"2002-05-19",3.8,"Deep chestnut color, slightly hazy with a nice head and decent lace. Bready,malt nose with hints of spice and fruit. Massive bready flavors,thin to medium bodied,some spicyness detected (nutmeg). Finishes dry, bitter, and acidic, oversteps its bounds in this aspect IMHO. A decent pint but not as good as I was expecting but by all means not one to pass up.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"

The flavor is beautifully nutty, with just the right touch of spice and sourness to give it a distinctive character.

4311,"2002-05-07",3.4,"While this is a beautiful looking beer, a nice reddish-brown, caramel color with a diminishing head, immediately there is a bitter malt bite, very dry and acidic, but it softens and slightly sweetens with successive sips, still maintaining that dry bitter finish.","Evanston, Illinois, USA","cranesareflying"

4311,"2002-04-25",2.4,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2012 Bottle (500mL, BB Jun 2012). Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is dark amber. Aroma is lightly malty (cookie, caramel), lightly hoppy (apricot), with a strong note of cardboard. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter, papery. Medium to full body, syrupy texture, lively carbonation.

Wow, still 6 months away from their BB date and already this is oxidized to hell (bought from cold storage too).  Not much else in the nose besides the cardboard even.  Dead in the mouth.  Truly awful.  I thought this used to be good???","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

The head that ate Ohio was still occupying the space 3/4 the way up the pint glass when I downed my last gulp - outstanding!  The moderate nose is balanced and complex with herb, spice, and flower, combined with spruce and earth.  Some cask wood was also evident.  The flavor is sweet, warm, spicy with a toasty quality and a long rich and bitter finish.  The medium to full body is creamy, dry and smooth with a light alcoholic and astringent finish.

The nose is unusual and complex, with some dried citrus rind, coffee, sherry, and dry wood tones. The flavor is equally complex and impressive: a rich blend of roasted barley, toasted nut, caramel, hops, coffee with woody flavors (yes: woody flavors). Finish is warm and bitter, a little on the dry side but very, very satisfying. It is difficult to refrain from chugging this ale.

Very fruity tasting with tons omalt.  However, with that said, the hops are right there with the malt to balance it out.  How does Fullers keep such balance in their beers?  Incredible.

The flavour is fairly robust, leaning towards dry malt notes like toast, as well as earthy notes which I find contributed by both the hops and yeast.  Its an earthy, woody brew with some gentle but insistent bitterness.  The Fullers yeast comes to the fore here, more so than in any of their other beers.  Good, robust ale...perhaps not as good as when I first had it (as beer 999 back in 1998) but still solid.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
