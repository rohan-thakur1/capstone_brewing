4301,"2016-08-02",3.4,"Draft. Pours gold with a white head. Clean pale malty base, straw, mild sweetness, and low bitterness. Solid.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
4301,"2016-07-29",3.8,"Light, clean malty lager aroma from a clear light yellow body with a medium foamy white head. The flavor is surprisingly light at first with a little sweetness and the body seems very watery. After a bit, some nice noble hop bitterness and flavor kick in and it becomes more rounded and refreshing. Starts to show some German beer character right at the end. Finishes light but with a good lingering but light bitterness on the tongue. Very light, refreshing beer thats perfect for summer drinking.","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"
4301,"2016-04-06",3.8,"(Cannette): Une base céréalière moelleuse, pain grillé et une généreuse infusion de houblons herbacés étoffés et dagrumes tranchantes. Une légère touche de sulfure sadoucit en respirant. Très satisfaisant.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
4301,"2016-02-25",2.9,"Can pour from Wallys. Aroma can be smelled from over a foot away. Effervescent light yeast like a sparkling wine, mild cracker/biscuit malt. Appearance is clear golden yellow with mild sparkle, finger width fluffy white head with poor retention and trace lacing. Taste is mild sweet cracker malt with noble German hop slightly metallic bitter. Palate is medium bodied with thin texture, soft carbonation and mild bitter/tart finish. Overall, fitting for the style but other than being eminently quaffable doesnt have too much else to recommend it.","Fremont, New Hampshire, USA","tfontana"

4301,"2015-08-25",3.4,"Sample at the taproom. Clear golden color with a medium thin white head that evaporates steadily to a film. Spotty lacing. Aroma of grassy hops, biscuit malt and a touch of fruit. Light-bodied and crisp with flavors of herbal hops, bready malt and fruit. The finish is mildly bitter up front with a malty aftertaste. Decent overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

4301,"2015-02-03",3.0,"I had this back-to-back with the Hangar 24 Farmhouse and had a very difficult time telling the difference. Some hay, light cheese, and a bit refreshing but overall a little light in the lagers.","Redwood City, California, USA","tightslice"

4301,"2015-01-05",3.7,"Draft at Angels Trumpet in Phoenix. Pleasantly malty with a salty pretzel and toasty baked baguette Pilsner malt aroma, minerallic and carbonic and refreshing in the mouth, well-balanced light sweetness with peppery finishing bitterness. Surprisingly enjoyable after finding it in poor shape at GABF 2013 (DMS off-notes and husky aroma/flavor). Balanced, expressive and clean, possibly one of the few true Bavarian-style Helles being made in the US.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
4301,"2014-12-31",3.6,"12oz can pours with a clear pale gold body that supports a thin white head. The aroma offers up mild levels of sugary bready malts, a dash of lime and then floral hops. The taste starts with sweet sugary malts, a sweetened lime note and then a sliver of breadiness. Pretty solid helles.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4301,"2014-12-30",3.1,"Clear golden. Truthfully Im shitty at rating a helles, but bits a light bread dough and noble hops aroma. Taste is clean and light with a very light spicy hop bite. Finishes clean and dry. Fine beer","Saskatchewan, CANADA","dresden"
4301,"2014-08-24",2.9,"Gotta love that ""sweet candy-like malt sweetness."" A crisp clean brew. Refreshing, if a bit simple. Crisp bittersweet finish as well. Not as cool as Id hoped, but not bad.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
4301,"2014-05-13",2.7,"16 oz: on tap in The Monkey Paw, San Diego on 18th March 2014. Light golden with a white crown that tried to hang around for a while. Crisp and almost sharp in the mouth, almost odourless (like most lager/pilsners) with a slight malt hint. The taste leaned towards maltiness with the hops keeping the beer balanced and on an even keel. An OK Helles in all aspects.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"
4301,"2014-04-29",4.0,"Excellent Helles-style beer. It is an under brewed style in the USA. On tap it seemed a little bit under carbonated in comparison to what you would be served in Germany or Austria.","California, USA","amazinwlrdfood"
4301,"2014-03-30",2.7,"Pours a crisp yellow color with a sweet hops aroma. Taste is surprisingly sweet, almost candy like. A mild candy corn flavor. This beer is tasty for a light beer and the sweetness adds a nice twist. Not a beer Id go out of my way for, but would order it if available.","Diamond Bar, California, USA","Barreras"
4301,"2014-03-24",3.7,"After a rough pour it produces up a pastel, sunny gold, shy of bright, with a flaccid, soppy white mess atop. Spicy, hoppy, lemon balm and Vietnamese mint dominated nose with just a flush of candied citrus and grass. Soft and subtle palate. Quite creamy giving it a false fullness with a dry, softly bitter and peppery finish. There is a juicy burst of citrus that gives it a plump sweetness too. The base malt is dusty and a little grainy and balances in well. Doesnt represent the Münchener Helles we all know but as a lager it is a tasty and refreshing bench sitter. Not much length, it is crisp, clean and drinks well even as it warms. This is a very pleasing lager. Good stuff!

4301,"2013-03-11",5.0,"While in Bavaria for a month, or so, I had a lot of exposure to the Helles style (so much so, honestly, I got a bit tired of it) that I feel extremely confident in judging it. It has a full mouthfeel. Its malty and lightly sweet. It has a wonderful bright white head that clings to your glass, leaving picturesque lacing throughout the length of your glass.","USA","minsco1"

Im kind of suprised it rates so high for this style.  big clean cereal notes on the finish with not much else.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
4301,"2012-02-03",3.8,"a - normal lager yeast smell, but a subtle hint of some nice toast and very very light hops.

a - beautifully clear golden lager - decent head that dissipates quickly to a scattered layer with a tad bit of lacing.

t - an easy drinking lager with some nice sweet grain notes, subtle hops and a great cracker finish.  The malt is in the forefront of this beer and it is really tasty for such a light beer.  Very sweet grain, but not cloying, and a really nice toasted malt character.

o - a great beer and easy to drink.  This style is not seen enough because it is such a ""light"" beer, but I think that more of these would do the craft beer world good.","Hollywood, California, USA","Mr_TBone"

4301,"2011-05-03",3.6,"A: The beer pours a slightly hazed golden straw color with a couple fingers of white head on top.

S: Smells somewhat sweet with quite a lot of lager yeast on the aroma.  Pale malts and light breadiness with just a hint of corn to it.  There is a nice hint of floral hops and some straw and grass in the background.

T: Flavors are clean and simple and there is quite a nice bready sweetness to the beer.  Pale malts interact nicely with the light and crisp hop flavors.  Just a touch of corn and a very mild bitterness on the finish.

M: Medium in body, definitely fuller than your average helles, with a moderate carbonation.
