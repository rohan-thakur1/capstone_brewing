1339,"2012-06-30",3.5,"UPDATED: FEB 1, 2016 At the brewpub. Lovely dark red brown and delicate smokey peat flavor.  A little watery one the pallet but it was supposed to be more sessionable. Well liked by me and the Missus. Serving.tap","Chicago, Illinois, USA","rubbishystuff"
1339,"2011-11-03",3.5,"On tap at brewpub, pours a dark amber with a red hue in the light and a thin off white head, the aroma has a nice malt backbone with some caramel, the flavor has a very roasty front end with a hop touch in the finish, some smoke and chocolate in there as well, nice.","Quad Cities, Illinois, USA","cbfobes"
1339,"2010-11-03",3.9,"Draft at the brewpub.  Deep brown-black, opaque.  Sweet Porter-like malt aroma.  Roasty, smoked aroma.  This is my kind of Scottish Ales.  Medium bodied, with some light mossy roastiness. Light soapy cocoa bitterness blaances it out.  Malt centric all the way.  A touch of oak?  Nice.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
1339,"2009-06-13",3.5,"Sampler @ brewpub.  Color is clear but dark, light ruby, brown.  Aroma is roasted, muddy, and earthy.  Flavor is similar with stronger roast and just a bit of that soil/earth maltiness. Also, there is a bit of berries sprinkled throughout the flavor and aroma.  Comes off a bit more like a porter than a Scottish bitter, but I enjoyed it.  Now that I have read the description I did not pick up any smoked malts, I would guess less than 10% (even maybe less than 5%) of the grain bill.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
1339,"2009-02-08",3.2,"From tap with a thick creamy head, dark brown color with ruby hints.  Aroma is very malty with some smoke notes coming through.  Flavor is caramel malt, some more roasted malt notes in the middle leaving some smokey notes in there with the beer overall finishing very smooth.  A good beer by Carlye again.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"

1339,"2007-11-17",3.3,"On tap at the brewpub on 6/20/07: Pours a transparent dark copper mahogany with a thin, wispy-lacing white head.  Aroma of roasty chocolate malts reminiscent of a stout or porter.  Body starts with a touch of caramel sweetness and earthy hops toward a more bitter, but thin milk chocolate finish.  Not really a true Scottish ale, but pretty decent.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1339,"2007-09-23",4.0,"Had this one on draught as part of a sampler flight at the brewpub in Rockford, Illinois.  Dark brown, thick tan head with a very smokey nose, barbeque and caramel throughout.

1339,"2007-05-24",3.4,"On tap at the brewery. Deep red-brown body, thin buff head. Peaty aroma and body, with breads, toast, and berries. Light, creamy palate with no alcohol character.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
1339,"2007-05-10",3.3,"Sampler. Yes, it is peaty. A dark red-brown color, complicated lacing. Did I mention peat? That and an unexpected taste of bitter cocoa: not too much, but noticable when you werent looking for it. Good, rich-tasting beer.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

1339,"2006-12-16",3.6,"The body is a reddish chestnut capped with a bubbly ecru head that rapiodly transforms into a ring.  The aroma has lightly roasted malts, chocolate, dark caramel, and some jucy fruitiness to it.  Some toffee, peat smoke, and aged wood are added to the flavor.  An enjoyable drink.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp? Brewing Company, Rockford, IL<font size=-1>","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
1339,"2006-05-08",3.7,"On tap at brew pub:  Poured mahogany red with a fuzzy beige head.  Aroma is of peat smoke.  Lots of malt sweetness, cherries and dark fruits.  Good lacing along edge of glass.  Plate is medium and crisp.","Machesney Park, Illinois, USA","McKnizzle69"
1339,"2006-04-30",3.1,"On tap

Deep caramel brown body with no visible head or carbonation.  There were hints of cherries dipped in Hersheys low grace chocolate with undertones of vanilla, wheat and a lurking bitterness.  A little on the watery side, but it compensates somewhat with the contrasting bitterness.  Overall it was solid but not memorable.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
1339,"2006-02-20",2.9,"Clear brown body.  Dry brown, toasty aroma.  Brown malt flavor with a toasty, dry finish.  Uninspiring.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
1339,"2006-02-19",3.5,"Pours to a reddish dark mahogany body with a thin white head.  The flavor is sweet milk chocolate and nice peat malt.  The aroma is lightly peaty and has some light powdered sugar.  Very easy drinking.  Sugary mouthfeel with a medium body.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
1339,"2006-01-22",3.0,"On tap at the brewpub.Hazy deep mahogany, off-white head with decent retention and lots of spotty lacing. Almost no armoa but what is there is uncharactersitc grassy hops and some dry grain. Fortunatey, little such grassiness makes its way into the flavor, which is instead nutty, dry light toasted grain and a tiny bit of smoke. Medium body & palate. Similar to an English brown, surprisingly dry for a Scottish ale; could have used more malt sweetness.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"
1339,"2005-12-17",3.6,"Very good scotch ale. From the tap at the brewpub. Smooth and creamy. Off white, tan head, lasting. Enjoyed the flavor. Not as ""filling"" as some other darker beers.","Janesville, Wisconsin, USA","amberale1"
1339,"2005-08-08",2.9,"Nice translucent ruby brown color with a tan head.  Aroma is wet cardboard, hazelnuts, charcoal and bitter-sweet chocolate morsels.  Flavor is a drawback, accentuated with vinegar, astringent sweetness, some caramelized pecans, cocoa powder and hazelnut shells.  Not endowed with many Scottish ale traits.  Perhaps some rye malt.  Eh.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
1339,"2005-08-06",3.3,"This is better than the ratings that this has been getting. Had on Tap at Garrets in Rockford. Dark Dark Ruby ish in color with a thick off white head. The nose is creamy with some bits of malts here and there, the taste is just about the same with more caramel in there. Give this a shot if you get the chance, it is quite pleasant and drinkable.","Saint Louis, Missouri, USA","SubstanceT"
1339,"2004-07-02",3.1,"Sample at the brewpub (nitro).  Creamy lasting off-white head, very dark mahogany...looks almost porter/stout-like.  Fresh loamy, caramel nose.  Very sweet, smooth, creamy, with caramel/vanilla dominating, and just a touch (not enough, really) of smoke.  Would be more pungent, peaty and distinctive off nitro.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1339,"2004-01-07",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 27, 2006 tap at brewpub-very dark wine red appearance.  no head at all!  somewhat malty, but no peat/smokeyness to mention.  overall, pretty bland.
rerate-this beer is much improved.  Pours mahogony red with a fuzzy beige head.  aroma is of peat smoke, cherries, dark fruit(plums) and lots of smokey. meaty malts.  The smoke emerges at it reached proper temperature.  Palate is medium and crips without becoming cloying or any heavy sweetness like other scottish ales.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
