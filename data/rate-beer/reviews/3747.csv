3747,"2016-01-14",4.1,"Awesome pour with a nice rocky head. Cloudy orange in color with bright carbonation. Aromas are out of control with pepper, lemon, piney hops, and the classic bubblegum yeast. The taste follows with bright citrus up front followed by some musty hops and an effervescence that carries the flavors away. Its both what I imagined a imperial weizen to be and at the same time it is completely without boundaries. Very good!","Florida, USA","Weezel"

Flavor profile is strongly yeasty, plenty of spice, esters, pepper, dough, etc. with some lemon citrus, very faint sweetness, breadiness, as well as some medicinal alcohol present late.

It was more yeasty and sweet with the hops barely making an appearance in the back.

3747,"2013-11-17",3.8,"Bottled August 15, 2013.
Appearance: The body is completely hazy with an golden-amber hue. The head erupts from the body to form a tall and dense white head that maintains its shape for a long time.
Aroma: The aroma is fruity with a grapefruit presence that has a sweet edge to it, straw and lemon come to mind after with a clean floral presence and a sweet banana backing. The aroma leans a tad sweet and is far more complex than I am giving it credit for. Good strength as well. Edit: Perhaps some pineapple here.
Taste: The intro is an odd mix of mildly bitter grapefruit and sweet banana. The two flavors clash, slightly, through into the mid-taste where straw and lemon come to mind. The finish become a bit floral, a tad chalky, and a bit clovey. The finish lingers of chalk, grapefruit and floral dryness. The finish is semi-dry.
Palate: Full-bodied, creamy and mildly carbonated.
Overall: This is an odd assortment of flavors, but I enjoy it. I have drank almost the whole bottle while writing this review, it is immensely drinkable especially at 9.25% abv. This is a great beer, well done.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

The beer is cloudy and straw yellow hued with an inch of dense, white head. The aroma offers a healthy serving of banana, with some wheat And lemons coming in behind. The flavor does not live up to the promise of the aroma. A bit soapy, and alcohol presence, which was absent in the aroma, asserts itself in the flavor profile. Lemon zest and window cleaner. Not horrible, but also not a repeat for me. Medium bodied with an odd astringency. Aventinus is still the go to weizenbock for me.

3747,"2012-06-29",3.7,"A very clean, deep yellow/golden pour, great bubbly white head and a modest amount of cascading bubbles within the brew. I cannot emphasize the inviting aroma of this beer. Sweet notes of wheat and clove hit the nose first with some mild citrus and flowery presence later. Not overly sweet nor overly spiced. Flavor has a very strong citrus orange and lemon combination with strong notes of clove in the middle and finishes up with a wheat and light alcohol bite. Surprisingly the hefe style as an imperial holds up very well. Body lacks the yeasty mouth feel but the beers density replaces that feeling very well. Overall a great offering by NG. As far as imperials go, its very well balanced as all flavor/aromas can be detected individually.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"
3747,"2012-06-10",3.5,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

Imperial Weizen pours a mildly hazy pale straw color with a very large fluffy white head that leaves a sheet of lace down the side of the glass.  

There is a ton of coriander and banana in the nose, with milder wheat and tangy citrus notes.

The flavor is full and bold, at least by Hefe standards.  The requisite wheat, coriander, and banana are present up front.  Although it starts sweet, a tangy grapefruit citrus note starts building and creates a slight hoppy presence toward the end of the sip.  The finish is pleasantly clean.

Considering this is a 9.6% Hefeweizen, this is impressively balanced and actually a little bit dry.  The start of the sip is fairly sweet, but by the end it is barely noticeable.  The carbonation is creamy and crisp at the same time, and it works with the beers flavor.

I was impressed that this did not get syrupy or cloying given the high ABV, but Hefes definitely have a ceiling in my book.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"
3747,"2012-05-15",4.1,"Pours unclear lemon orange in color with a decent off white head. The aroma brings bready yeast and sweet notes, with a bit of lemon in there.

3747,"2012-05-09",4.8,"hazy gold with a dense white head. clingy full body with high carbonation.

aroma: bright tart wheat, bitter orange, citrusy hops, green banana, apple, alcohol, and some spicy yeast notes. somewhere between Vitus, Orval, and an imperial wit.

taste: tart wheat and bitter orange dominate; backed by notes of banana, apple, citrusy hop bitterness, pale malt sweetness, nutmeg, and alcohol warmth. there are occasional, subtle hints of plastic, common in hefe-weizen, but none of the smokey or rubbery phenols.

very complex and intriguing; combining the best qualities of Orval with the best qualities of weizenbock, with a little panache of its own.","Sanford, Florida, USA","SanfordBrewer"

Sour notes balanced with a whack of banana and cloves. Then juicy Cascade hops kick in before a white pepper finish. Flavour-wise, there is an immediate bitter orange flavour before bananas and a sour linger. Moderate carbonation and a foamy mouth-feel. Really interesting.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","Benjii"
3747,"2012-04-27",3.3,"Originally reviewed: 3/16/12. 12oz bottle, poured into a tall weizen glass. From scanning the reviews, this one looks like its at least 8 months old. 

Pours a cloudy amber-tinted dark gold. A huge frothy white head tops er off. The first aroma that hits me is a big smack of floral hops. Wow. That was unexpected. [After reading the label on the bottle, I now see this was a dry-hopped weizen - very cool]. The more I pull at this one, the expected aromas creep through - clove, banana bread, cinnamon. 

The body is on the scant side, as it goes down quite slick. The massive head scored some of the carbonation away, no doubt. Alcohol, though higher, is barely detected in the flavor. Subtle hints of ethanol on the back end. Mild citrus flavors meld well with the faint hoppiness, and lightly-tart sourdough bread quality. 

A decent brew that I would like to have again, but itd need to be in a much fresher form for sure.","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"

3747,"2011-11-18",3.4,"I must say, I find it slightly ridiculous that this is listed as a Hefeweizen at 9.6%, but when they tried to session-ize it with Crackd Wheat, that one got listed as a Wheat Ale.... gracious me.

Pours a beautiful impenetrably hazy golden color with a huge fluffy white head and lots of lacing on the glass. 

The aroma up front is way too dish-soapy for me, lots of apple rind and brash citrus.,,, but as I let it sit in the glass this tends to mellow out a lot leaving a far more pleasant aroma of lemony citrus, sweet banana, & orange leaving apple behind (thankfully). Its a veritable fruit basket of a bouquet. 

The flavor is sweet, sweeter than I would like it too be, but what was I to expect from an Imperial Weizen? Its got a lot of fruit flavor plenty of citrus and the level of bitterness is nice. But I get a clash from the sweetness here that reminds me of  what I dont like about crystal heavy APAs and IPAs, the sweetness paired with the bitterness and the booziness all just sort of taste muddled up a bit. Im making this sound really bad, and I dont think it is ""really bad"" its just not exceptionally good. The spiciness is nice and I enjoy the hop flavor... it works well with the yeast driven fruitiness but again sweetness and booziness get in the way a bit. 


Bringing the gravity down on this to make Crackd Wheat was the best thing they could have done with this recipe, I waited for years to try this beer and I dont think its a case of my impossible expectations being let down as much as its just sort of not my kind of beer... which is not to say its a bad beer.

Appearance: Hazy golden yellow.  Slightly darker than a traditional heffeweisen, but hey, its an IMPERIAL weizen, so its to be expected.  Nice thick head that looks like it could be the next generation memory foam mattress.  Spotty lace forms islands of white around the sides of the glass.

Taste: Surprisingly balanced bitterness considering the 9.6%ABV.  The taste mirrors the aroma but with some alcoholic warmth...  now its a drunken circus.  Sweet, vanilla-cream once things settle down.  A malty sweetness sticks with you for a few minutes to remind you of the fun but without turning into that annoying friend who just doesnt know when to leave.

I tend to prefer the more rustic, creamy look of the German ones, of course this doesnt apply to all cases.the beer it self is a cloudy light gold. Perhaps a bit light for a weizenbock, but good looking nonetheless. 

The smell is the first thing noticeably different here. This is alcoholic and hoppy, not really what the typical German weizenbock is.

The flavor is similar. Too hoppy and orangey/bitter.

I understand this is a bit of an experiment as it is a completely new style of brew, but one of Dans weaker ones unfortunately. Hops + Weissbier is a hard thing to get right, Dan should try some Schneider for reference.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

Flavor starts sweet and clovey, very clovey before opening up to a fruit salad of banana, orange peel, a touch of lemon and finishing with a clear fresh citric hoppiness that lingers in the lightly bitter finish, along with a touch of alcohol.

Flavor is huge on sweet grainy wheat and bready yeast up front, then comes the sweet banana, hints of spicy clove and toast and then the flood of hugely citrus hops, lots of grapefruit and lemon taste in there, finishes solidly on citrusy hops and a touch of wheat. Might be a bit too much alcohol coming through as it warms a bit above fridge temp. Palate is pretty heavy bodied, creamy on entry, dry with a little alcohol slickness to the finish and a medium, sharp carbonation. Really tasty, dangerously easy to drink despite the high ABV and somewhat heavy feel. Perfect summer time sipper.

Aroma is quite nice. Lots of citrusy hops mixed in with plenty of banana, clove, medium sweet wheat, bubble gum, and a light yeasty spice. A bit of an herbal quality to the hops with a hint of vanilla and some lemons and oranges. Flavor has lots going on, but seems a bit messy. Lots of banana and wheat up front with a nice lemon and orange citrus along with plenty of clove and some coriander. An herbal spiciness and bitterness quickly comes in along with some yeast spice. A light bready malt and some tropical fruits before this finishes dry and fairly spicy with a light, herbal bitterness and a somewhat chewy malt sweetness. Lengthy aftertaste following a medium, somewhat sticky and chewy body with a hint of alcohol warmth. Medium, creamy carbonation. Overall, a nice beer, but Im not really a huge fan of these bigger hefes. They remind me too much of homebrew experiments gone wrong.

Very happy to try this one as these Unplugged beers are typically really good.  Appearance is a vibrant cloudy gold with a thin white head, a bit brighter than the typical German Hefe but without the rich white head.  Aroma is rather unique, Im getting banana and clove attributes with the addition of vanilla and citrus.  Taste is about the most explosive Hefe Ive ever tried.  The spiciness of the clove is apparent along with huge fruit juice notes, something like orange, banana, and (as Ive seen in other reviews) pears.  The finish is noticeably bitter, carbonation is pretty heavy and its a burper, but at the same time its an easy drinker.  The ABV is pretty high, and it does pack a punch.

The nose is what you expect of a hefeweizen.  Lots of coriander, lemon and orange.  The yeasty hefe character.

Still warm out even though it is September.

A-Body is a hazy, quite cloudy copper hue. Fogginess is dynamic and thick. Pours with a 1-2 finger foamy white head which eventually fades to a thin collar and leaves no lacing behind in the glass.

S- Alcohol is potent initially but some classic hefe weizen characteristics can be detected in the background- clove, white bread, a hint of banana-and maybe even a hint of anise.

T-Mild fruity esters upfront-a hint of apple, and white grape. A slight grainy tone is in the background as well as a hint of yeast. Some banana and spice come through for the finish with a moderate alcohol bite and big alcohol heat. The alcohol is most prominent in the end but some initial flavors linger.

M- Body is fairly light and dry and has high carbonation as well as some spritzy champagne like qualities. The yeasty smoothness keeps it from falling into the champagne category.

D- This is a decent brew, that with age, is reminding me more of a belgian tripel (american interpretation) than a german ale. Its quite boozy but complex enough to be enjoyable. Not sure what this was like fresh-right now it is decent, but not the best NG brew out there.

3747,"2010-08-20",3.4,"My Bottom Line:
Peaches, bananas and unripe pear skins cover this Imperial Weizens herbal, citrusy hops.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the cloudy amber.
-There is a lot going on here, but I must say I find the flavor profile a tad muddled.
-The fierce effervescence alleviates most of the bodys rotundity.
-A little more cohesion flavor-wise, and perhaps a cleaner yeast profile, and I would have loved this.

Smell: Cloves and banana really dominate the nose. The underlying notes include cinnamon, cascade hops, and bavarian style yeast.

Taste: Bitter cascade hops, over ripe banana, and too much clove for my liking. Only a small tinge of alcohol which Im happy with. This one had taste potential but it faltered.

Mouthfeel: a touch syrupy with a ""heavy side of medium"" body. A bit cloying imho.

Drinkability: Doesnt taste good enough, have a nice enough mouthfeel, or a low enough abv to get a high score in this category.

This has probably been my least favorite of the Unplugged Series. One thing I should say is that I received the bottle as an extra in a trade about 5 weeks ago and have no idea how much age was put on it prior to getting it. The label says drink fresh so who knows if age has tainted my experience.

3747,"2009-06-11",3.8,"12oz bottle very generously brought out from the east coast by CaptainCougar.   Pretty opaque golden-orange color with a big frothy white head that threatened to over-flow my tulip glass but barely stayed in.   The aroma is a healthy dose of phenolics and banana esters (over-ripe banana) and a leafy, citrucy hop addition.   The flavor is much like the cracked wheat, but with more alcohol heat (duh) and a little more bitterness.   This is quite dry for how big it is, with wheaty malt flavors, spiciness, and medium fruitiness that is a little grapefruit and a little banana.   The body is rather light for the size of the beer, and has ample carbonation with a soft texture.   A pretty cool creation, but a little too much alcohol burn, that seems a bit overkill in conjunction with the bitterness.   I think that a little more sweetness would have helped.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"
3747,"2009-05-28",4.0,"12 oz bottle courtesy of likely Discount Liquors (Milwaukee, WI). I continue my journey through the famed NG Wheat Beers! Pours a glowing orangish gold, big white thick head that sticks around, coats and laces, with a good hazed body, but still glowing. Aromas are typical of the wheat style, pushing banana and clove off the bat, a touch of faint spice, but largely the typical fare (Which isnt a bad thing at all). Initial is a decent body, taking on slight initial bitterness and moving into the estery banana and clove body. A touch of warming alcohol, moderate hoppiness, a little more actually than a beer from this style would normally have leaving a bitter finish and a bit of chalkiness on the palate. This isnt too sweet at all, but the flavors are pretty good, as the cinnamon comes through more noticeably into the body more, which is very pleasant. Ive really become a fan of hoppy wheat beers, and this beer fully displays its hops without going over the edge. The wheat, esters, and flavors are still the focal point, as even delicate cinnamon can be picked out. The hops are wonderful, but dont detract from other elements of the brew. Very good.

This pours a somewhat hazy orange color with a thick fluffy off-white head.  The aroma is an assortment of clove, cinnamon, yeast, citrus, wheat.  Smells good; there are whiffs of alcohol but not so much that it gets in the way of a lot of nice things going on.  The flavor is fairly sharp but not as alcoholic as expected (a good thing); a lot of bubblegum to go with clove, citrus hops, orange peel, wheat.  This isnt Dancing Man good but its far softer and delicate than I was expecting and overall quite enjoyable.  Based on my notes from a couple years ago, I wonder if the abv is a little lower in this release?  Perhaps its just better or more probable my tastes have changed.  Anyway, good beer.  Original Rating:   Bottle courtesy of pfoxyjohn. This is definitely a wheat beer on steroids. Pours a hazy golden color with a big fluffy off-white head. The aroma consists of melons, banana, orange, and an alcoholic yeasty scent. Flavors are sharp, tangy, and citrusy with lemon, orange peel, banana. There is a bit of an alcholic bite to this. Good beer. I enjoyed it on a nice warm Florida evening. Make sure you check the abv though... this isnt one of those slug in the sun kind of wheat beers.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

I can really smell what seems to be Cascade hops in the aroma with lots of clove, some banana, and a tinge of alcohol. The flavor is fruity and spicy (Belgian-like) with clove and lots of hops (Cascade?).  There is a mild to moderate level of bitterness that continues to build with each taste. The palate is smooth and creamy which goes with the full body, but seems to heavy for what is a Weizen beer at heart. Overall the flavors seem to be in conflict and the beer is just different.  It isnt nearly as good as the New Glarus Dancing Man Wheat.12 fl. oz. bottle from buckybeer shared with Rob.  Thanks Mark!  Rating #248 for this beer.
UPDATE on Unknown Date:   New Glarus Imperial Weizen has an aroma of banana and clove and is very spicy.  Its appearance is cloudy, deep gold, and has a lage, foarmy, lasting ivory-colored head that collapses to leave a puffy crown.  There is a massive level of carbonation but this doesnt seem to affect the full body as it is still creamy and mellow on the palate and coats the mouth.  The flavor is very spicy and presents clove and banana.  It finishes dry and spicy with some herbal hoppiness.  Again, this beer is quite hoppy and that really comes through in the finish.  Overall this beer is big and bold, generously hopped, and very herbal to the point of being minty!  Its definitely adventurous, but I havent quite come around to really liking this new style of ""Imperial Wheat"" beers which includes this one as well as other such as the Brooklyner-Schneider Hopfen-Weisse.

Pours a heavily clouded golden-orange, with a tall finger of sparse, soapy opalescent khaki. Flavor is interesting. It’s like a hybrid barelywine-hefeweizen. I still get a lot of those delicious spicy clove flavors, but then much of the high octane ester production from the gravity. Interesting. Complex and rich, yet not heavy. Lots of carbonation and the spritzy fresh Hefe character gives this example lots of depth. Hops come in and just add to the show. Their parching dry leaf and herbal character add to the freshness. You know what this beer is? This beer is how Batch 8000 should have been brewed. This what that beer SHOULD taste like. The bristling rich edge of hops adds a nice quality to the beer. It’s not sweet, it’s got great flavors and complexity, while maintaining drinkability in the face of gravity. I’m impressed. Nice show, Dan Carey.

3747,"2008-09-01",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 7, 2008 Bottle, weizen glass.  Big bouquet of carbonic yeastiness, pleasantly musty, shot through with cardamom and prunes. Pours a cloudy apricot-orange.  Huge frothy white head supports itself mushrooming above the glass, great retention and lacing.  Wispy curtains of sediment raining down through the beer.  Presents as a tropical fruit juice cocktail, with a hoppy edge to balance the malty sweetness, pineapple, orange, a hint of banana.  Initially, cardamom, maybe some cinnamon in the spice department, before the beer turns hot.  The alcohol burn is definitely here, but its well-complemented by cloves and peppery prickliness, and here that prune element in the nose comes into its prime, like a good plum brandy.  As the fruit fades, the hops take the stage again, more floral than grassy, warm lingering on the tongue, as the beer turns dry in its final aftertaste, which is quite pleasant (or maybe thats just me happily buzzed halfway through the glass) and seems to last forever.

Pours with a large off-white head that looks full of protein, very firm on top and not really dissipating at all; opaque orange beer looks unfiltered.  Very spritzy and spicy aroma, lots of pepper, coriander, cardamom, very faint banana; smells light and refreshing.  Medium to full body goes down smooth, hits first with spices, mostly with a smooth and slightly sweet malt character, then the finish gives the characteristic wheat aspects in the fruit and yeast.  Late in the finish, this dries out big time, wonderfully, and is lightly peppery on the tongue.  Lasts forever.  Light and refreshing despite 9.6%, this is an accomplishment of a beer, even if it doesnt give any particular ""wow"" moment.  An ode to craftsmanship.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

3747,"2008-08-22",3.5,"A big thank you to my cousin for a bottle of this much anticipated brew!  It is a dark, rusty, unfiltered pour with a handsome crown and lacing.  The label is simple and unpretentious.  The aroma is astonishingly good - richly floral and piquant, with a little alcohol rising up from the wildflowers.  The taste is the first of its kind I have experienced - a hopped up hefe, from what I can tell.  (The label and Ratebeer describe what went into the brew.)  It seems like a wheat base with some fairly sharp hops layered on - also orange, a sweet dessert-like flavor, and some acidity.  There is a kick from the 9.6% ABV too.  This is very complex, but it is not entirely successful because the flavor requires all your attention.  Despite the quality of the ingredients, this beer demonstrates why wheat beers usually are not loaded up with hops.  The Cascade hops and hefe flavors do clash a little -  but this is still worth trying.","USA","Slipstream"

3747,"2008-08-18",3.6,"Rating #375. From the bottle, purchased at Rileys in Madison. My first reaction to this was that it was Dancing Man on steriods, which prompted me to pull a bottle of Dancing Man from the fridge and taste the two side by side. The flavor profile between the two is remarkably similar, with this having more body and greater viscosity than DM. Notes of banana and clove are prominent on both the nose and on the palate, followed by hay, grass, and wheat berries. The finish is where the citrus and hops kick in, which is where this shows its difference from DM most profoundly. My overall reactions were that I liked this, but I find DM to be the more pleasurable experience, particularly given this style doesnt lend itself as well to the ""imperial"" brewing methods. And I would say that in terms of the more extreme weizens, I like Capitals take on the style better.","Illinois, USA","Philip"

Flavor is also heavy on the banana and clove...some bubble gum, yeast, dark fruit, and a very high level of alcohol.  Drinkability is very low if you compare it to your ’typical’ German Hefe, but it is not a slow quaffer by any means.  As odd as this sounds to say about a beer from Dan Carey, this one was just too hot for me right now...the alcohol is just too much for this drink.

3747,"2008-08-02",3.0,"A vigorous pour easily produces a five-finger thick, tan colored head in my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip glass.  The head is thick and creamy with quite a bit of structure and staying power and it also leaves lots of lacing on the sides of the glass.  The beer is a murky, pale amber color that shows a deeply hazed, reddish-orange tinged hue when held up to the light.  The aroma most noticeably smells of clove, but there is also more phenolics that lean towards, but don’t quite get to, aromas of plastic.  Fruit aromatics also play a role here; hints of typical banana, a slight, weird tropical fruit note and some musky melon notes.  there is almost a weird tartness this beer and there is a fairly big grain character that leans towards dusty crushed grain and cracker-like malt.  There is a certain spiciness here as well that I can’t quite place; somewhat like pepper, or grains of paradise, maybe a hint of horseradish, I really can’t quite grasp it.  An interesting nose, the higher original gravity seems to have produced a lot more esters and phenolics than one gets in a typical gravity Weizen-yeast ferment.  I am not quite sure it all works though, but it is interesting enough to not be objectionable.

As I take my first sip I also breath in the aroma, at which point it gets a bit hot with volatile esters and higher alcohols.  The flavor tastes of lightly sweet, dusty / chewy grain, with a backdrop of softer clove and other phenolic notes of plastic being lightly noticed.  Quite spicy, especially through to the finish where the piquancy is magnified a bit by a wheat tartness;  peppery notes in combination with the carbonation, sour ginger flavors, hot higher alcohols, .  Some sour melon notes and some not quite ripe pear flavors add a touch of fruitiness to this beer.  The body as a light fullness to it that is about right for a chewy Hefeweizen, but is down right dangerous for a beer of almost 10% abv; though the alcohol gets quite hot, so it ultimately is not hidden very well.

Clearly a derivative of a German Weizen and not nearly as funky as my description may lead one to believe; many of these flavors and aromas are noted particularly because they don’t usually play a role in the typical German Weizen profile.  An interesting beer, even if it doesn’t quite work, and it doesn’t seem to have that stripped out, filtered to death character that is typical of many New Glarus beers (not to say this isn’t filtered, it may be, but it better survived the process than some of their other beers).","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Medium bodied weiss. The malts are cereal, banana and clove with some grain. The hops are earthy. Its not really a hefe and its not a wheat wine, but somewhere in between. I wont try and classify it, but it has that typical New Glarus mouthfeel and balance. Interesting beer, Hides the alcohol very well. Mouthfeel si full. Finish is clean and crisp.

The aroma is really nice of orange citrus, banana, clove, nutmeg, and a good amount of hops. The flavor follows suit with the orange citrus and banana up front followed by the nutmeg and clove mixed in with a touch of malt sweetness. The hops make their presence known on the backend adding a good amount of earthy bitterness to the flavor. This is one hopped up hefe. The mothfeel is medium almost full bodied that is really easy to drink with a long, dry, bitter finish.

S- Most weizens seem to be light on the nose ... this one sure isnt! Very floral, piney hops, cloves, bits of banana, smells almost spicey.

T- Taste is much milder than the nose lets on. The clove and banana come out quite a bit and the perfumey floral scent is suppressed in the taste which I like. Definitely bitter on the back end but the hops dont seem to play a huge part in the flavor.

M- Perhaps a bit too thick and not quite crisp enough.

3747,"2008-05-28",3.4,"12oz bottle.<P>I generally take fidelity to style into consideration when rating a beer, but since its not really practical in this case, I rated simply by how much I enjoyed it.

<P>Pours a hazy apricot hue with massive, gigantic pillowy head. WAY too much carbonation -- the head from half a pour just kept building and building until eventually spilling over. A lot of this beer ended up on my kitchen counter, which pisses me off considering how much I paid for this bottle. Aroma gives up a huge, unsubtle burst of piney, flowery hops, bananas, clove and a bit of Sweet-tarts. While this odd hybrid works on the nose, it doesnt work very well for me on the palate. The commercial description is not kidding when it warns that ""dry hopping boldly rules over"" the wheat and the yeast. It starts out OK at first, letting the more traditional hefeweizen characteristics make a showing, but the aftertaste is so hoppy that its reminiscent of dish soap. I know a lot of hop-heads like that kind of thing but I dont, especially when it otherwise could have been an intriguing flavor combination. Palate is thinnish as per a hefeweizen and tingly with carbonation.
<P>An interesting flavor combination with a lot of potential, but the execution was just too much of a slap in the face to be really enjoyable.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

Huge nose on this with the sweet wheat, yeast and massive spiciness interacting beautifully.  Not to mention the big banana aroma with lemon zest.  Wow, this is a seriously big aroma for a hefe.  Big wheat taste up front which gives way to the spices - cloves are the showcase in the middle.  The spice gives way to the lemon zest and orange peel in the finish with a hop bitterness.  I didnt get too much banana in the taste compared to the smell.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth but, with the carbonation and the spice, there is a serious zing on the tongue.  This is certainly one of the better hefeweizens Ive ever tasted.  The spiciness is pretty big so the drinkability isnt quite what it could be.  However, this is, without a doubt, the most complex brew Ive ever tasted in this style.  Highly recommended!","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Aromas of freshly mashed bananas with an earthy hay-like aroma that has bits of citrus and bits of clove in it.  Flavors of toasted malt are prominent, along with some bitterness and lots of banana, clove and other esters rising into nose.   The citrus flavors from the hops go well with the banana and other esters from the wheat beer, but the bitterness feels odd, combined with the alcoholic bite in the finish, it leaves the mouth feeling not refreshed like a good wheat beer usually does or like a nice IPA can.  Mouthfeel is full and body is very chewy.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"
3747,"2008-05-21",4.3,"Now just based on appearance alone in a blind tasting this looks just like a German hefe.  Until the nose, then you get the dry hopped citrus aromas.  The palate boldly walks the line between an imperial IPA and a real living German hefe.  The yeast is predominant in all points of the beer, a beautiful hazy unfiltered appearance, spicy nose and lots of bubblegum, and clove nuances on the palate.  One of the most nicely done beers in the Unplugged series.  It would be even better in my opinion if they toned the hops down, I am one of those people that believes the addition of large amounts of hops does not make a beer better.  Having said that, normally I would mark a beer down because I am a style nazi, but for what Dan was going for this gets greats marks, but bottom line tastes like an IPA, made with a German yeast strain.","Gulf Shores, Alabama, USA","BlackDonald"

Pours a cloudy orange golden with a thick white head. Nose is yeast, wheat, hops, and alcohol. Flavor is spicy and sharp with a lot of hops in there not very typical of a german hefe.  I found this to be pretty good, but I think it really lacked the refreshing, wheaty, yeast quality I like in my hefes.

3747,"2008-05-16",3.7,"12 oz bottle.  Pours a cloudy orangish body with a foamy two finger light beige head that had excellent retention.  The nose is heavy doughy wheat with lesser impact from the yeast.  Theres a really odd amount of Cascade hops here as well that seems really out of place.  The yeast derived spiciness does emerge a little more the more I smell it though, with lots of clove, some cinnamon, and some allspice.  Intense yet weird aroma.  The flavor is full-on intense clove spiciness.  This really, really, reminds me of clove cigarettes.  The wheat is almost lost with all the yeast character going on here.  Cinnamon, bright Cascade hop bitterness, spicy alcohol, and a touch of banana very late in the finish.  Mouthfeel is full bodied with a slight bread dough stickiness that might get a bit bothersome were it not for the fizzy effervescent carbonation.  Overall, a fairly decent beer, but like the Bourbon Barrel Bock, not one that I could drink multiple bottles of.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Finish is reminiscent of weizenbock with the big wheat flavor.  Fascinating.  Not sure it would be a ""go to"" beer for me, but definitely an interesting brew.  Not entirely sure cloves and citrus play well together.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

The mouthfeel is full-bodied, slick and lightly tart with at a somewhat sour finish that leaves a slight warming sensation in your chest. This is easily the fullest bodied wheat that Ive ever sampled. The flavor is of sweet/sour wheat, cloves, candy sugar and bitter, piny and slightly citric hops.

Taste is similar when in the mouth, but once swallowed the wheaty clove orange character are actually fighting with the near iipa hoppyness, causaeing a very confusing and annoying flavour to finish. This stays the whole beer which tells me one of two things. Get rid of the wheat and youve got a hot iipa. Or get rid of the hops and youve got an hot wheat wine.

Recieved this in a recent trade with Mully, thanks again Matt for the great trade! A beautiful pour of a hazed golden. After I swirled the bottle and finished the pour a fog like haziness slowly overtook the polished golden. A soft pour produced an off-white two + finger meringue like head that only fell a half finger and left some really great webbed lacing on its way. A great looking brew!

Wow! Intense spiciness in the nose. Big bold clove, banana,orange peel, and lemon greet the nose right away and pretty much dominate. There is a white pepper spiciness in there. Whatever strain of yeast they used....damn, did it create some big aromas. A little too big on the spiciness for my liking.

Theres a hint of banana on the finish but its not nearly as strong as the nose suggested. The wheat base is evident with a twang upfront before it cools down and lets the fruit come through. Big orange peel and clove mid-palate eventually die down and the wheat twang shows itself again on the swallow. A kind of dusty/chalky yeastiness comes through every now and then. A big weizen without a doubt!

The body is a hefty medium with a little stick in the back of the throat. Silky body with a healthy massaging carbonation.

The spiciness in here is so big that one bottle in a sitting is enough for me. With that being said, its still an enjoyable brew. 

New Glarus does a great job with everything, but especially their wheat beers. Although hefes arent my favorite style this is another good one although maybe a touch over the top. Ive fallen in love with their Unplugged Series!

Imperial aroma for sure.  A sharp and tangy bite cuts through the wheat smoothness.  Taste is concentrated wheat paste with green banana, orange and clove.

Perfect balance between all elements. High alcohol content is balanced by thick body. Crisp, refreshing, smooth. Everything a weizen should be. This is one of Dan Carreys finest achievements.

It also has a sharp ear wax bitterness (grapefruit peel) and a fair amount of heat in the finish.  Palate is nice and full and creamy.

3747,"2008-04-16",3.9,"12oz bottle from drewbeerme - thanks, Andrew!!! Another killer from the great Dan Carey, and Id say this is probably the impy weizen that most closely approximates its original style without compromising its extremity. You get that lovely cloudy body and big refreshing taste from the unfiltered brew. The spices are not overbearing or excessively sweet, and the body is nicely full. The kick comes with the abundant hopping and it provides a nice bite at the outset and again at the finish. Really interesting and complex beer, another winner from NG.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Aroma could be the best Ive ever had. Righteous cloves with a equally prominent American c-hop flash. Lemon chiffon and vanilla buttercream treat with buttery baguettes a citric banana medley to the aromatic symphonys delight. The aroma is just about as bright and sweet as it gets. Flavor pipes in with an amplified affirmation of the preceding aromatic sequences. Cackled white pepper rides with sugar cloves for a bright, snappy soliloquy. Honeyed marigolds give a bright, herbal essence to the citric brightness from the c-note profile. The body builds to a heavy presence on the palate, presenting a hefty challenge for the tongue to heave it up after the bitterness and sweetness set into it. Tingly sensations of bright vanilla coated cloves intertwine with crushed white pepper and cackled cloves for a lively, bitter clean finish.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

The hop aroma reminds me of that oniony garlic flavor of columbus or summit though the bottle says cascade so perhaps that quality is just from the yeast.  Either way the aroma is huge and nice.  Taste is not quite up to par with the aroma.  The alcohol and overall bigness of the beer results in the drinkability suffering.

Great thick orange pour: cloudy as hell with great lasting white head with superhero lacing.  Smell is actually complex and intriguing.  It has the distinctive hefeweizen smell but has a nice hoppy citris backdrop too.  Flavor is developed and balanced - it has a nice mixture of the hefe yeast flavor with some great hops and citris notes in there as well.  It is nice to pick up a sweet lemon flavor and not have it resemble Lemon Pledge or 409.  Mouthfeel is stellar - thick and creamy with a perfect amount of carbonation.  For a style I cant normally stand - this is the best hefeweizen I have had without a doubt!","Austin, Texas, USA","pintsize"

Again thanks go to Jason for sending a few of these.  Unlike the previous one I plan on laying down a couple to see how this one will age.  To me it was a little fresh and could do with some time.  Currently it tastes like a juiced up version of the Copper Kettle Weiss.  All in all another solid entry in the (so far) outstanding line of Unplugged beers.
Aroma / Appearance - A half finger head rested above the cloudy rust tinted body for a while before deciding to settle.  It was hard to tell if anything was going on but I did detect a slight trace of carbonation.  The scent of spicy banana bread made from very ripe fruit covers up the orange floor polish.  This was not as complex as I was expecting which was a bit of a letdown.
Flavor / Palate - The first sip unfolded a slight bitterness that contained banana, orange creamsicle and oak chips.  They sat on the tongue for a minute or two before the dry finish began to appear.  Overall it was a nice creamy blend of aggressive German wheat flavors.  This was not my favorite but I wouldnt mind popping one of these open at some point in the future to see how ages has treated it.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Best smelling hefeweizen ever...Huge fruity, banana notes, mild clove, and a big burst of citrusy fruits and orange with a blast of hops behind that.

3747,"2008-03-10",4.2,"Pours glowing and golden, but thick and hazy; an indefinitely lasting, creamy and rich layer of foam leaves a film of steamed milk lace up the side.  Couldnt look more perfect.  Aroma is lively with hop resin and tropical fruit, offering an interesting counterpoint to the spicy sweetness of cinnamon, banana, and bubblegum; somewhat doughy, but refreshing and intricate.  Flavor at first is a lot of acid and red spice, then dried out with citrus peels and barren cascade resins; a syrupy sweetness of cotton candy and honey.  Crisp cloves and gummy yeasts are steadfast throughout.  Mouthfeel is creamy, generous and somewhat dense; medium to full in body, crisp, dry, and very soft.  A waft of heated floral perfume in the very dry and lightly bitter finish.  A wonderfully creative, unique offering, if not something to be compared against a more classically confined hefeweizen like Weihenstephaner; the routes it takes that are different or unexpected lead to some nice surprises throughout.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
3747,"2008-03-08",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 4, 2009 Well, as usual this is a very interesting beer.  Dan Carey truly is a master at his craft.  This one pours like a typical Hefe, though with a much more substantial looking body.  A cloudy, glowing tangerine color is crowned by a massive, billowing head of whipped egg whites.  The foam lasts for ages, leaving thick rings of lacing on the glass.  The signature Hefe aromas of banana, clove, and nutmeg are all there, but the kicker is a seriously bitter, dry, grassy hop kick.  It smells like a Hefe/IPA half-n-half.  Flavors follow those same guidelines, with the dry hops and wheat really balancing out the malty sweetness and sharp citrus notes.  Finishes with lingering bitterness on the tongue.  Medium-full bodied, it stays dry and doesnt get sticky at any point.  This is about as good as it gets for a Hefe (if thats what we are really calling it).  Ultimately, it falls just a hair short of the masterpiece that is Dancing Man, but its damn good nonetheless.  This brew laughs at other Hefeweizens.  Drink this fresh!  It will never be better than it is right now.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Cascade hops dominate the flavor with light banana & clover over a very clean wheat base.

Taste is much the same.  There is a bit of a struggle in this beer, and the fight is between is between a hefeweizen and a pale ale.  No one wins out in the fight, but both flavors are noticed.  A bit chewy for a hefeweizen.  This beer should almost be thrown into the ""American Strong Ale"" as all of the other misfits of beer.  Anyway, rant aside, this is a great beer if you dont expect it to taste like a everyday hefeweizen.

3747,"2008-03-01",3.7,"Bottle and served in my Ayinger weizen glass: The beer pours a hazy golden amber hue with a huge frothy head and outstanding lace upon the glassware.  WOW what a nose on this beer! Resiny and citric hops jump out at you then there are some of the classic esters of banana and clove. I also found an interesting smoked and iodine vapour too.  The taste is quite bitter and juicy up front with the soft grains almost an afterthought. Very spicy and chalky dry as well on the finish. The mouth feel is quite aggressive and biting missing some of the refreshment associated with the genre, a noticeable smack of alcohol around the edges.  All in all it is indeed a different beast and very much a hybrid beer. Lacks the finesse of the Schneider & Brooklyner Hopfen-Weisse however, only moderately recommended.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
3747,"2008-03-01",2.8,"UPDATED: MAR 6, 2008 Pours a cloudy medium oak color with a typical hefe large head.  Soda-pop like carbonatiion when first poured in glass.  While trying to sniff this I notice that it stings my eyes.  Maybe from the high carbs and the hop oils.  Whatever it is irritating, literally.  

Aroma is mostly west coast hops with a bananna bread background.  Taste is an APA with some bread qualities to it.  Dry on the tongue.  The spices, if any, are lost in the hops, perhaps some clove at the end since it is such a strong spice but you really have search for it and then it could just be a suggestive sense from reading the description.  Although licking your lips you do get some spice after drinking half a glass.

Better than Dancing Man, which I did not like at all, and not knowing the ABV of this considering it is an ""Imperial"" I could not detect any alcohol, which I like in a hefe as I think the inherently high carbonation makes the  ABV much more noticable than in other styles.

This is a beer drinkers quandry.  Is it all fad and no substance much like a Stephan King novel or no fad and all substance like a William Faulkner.  Personally I tend to think this is more King than Faulkner, to much Cascade.","Ohio, USA","redlem"

Pours a cloudy, brownish-orange color; huge, textured off-white head with great retention and lacing that coats the glass; excellent head retention; excellent pour.  Plenty of clove, complex yeastiness, and bananas in the aroma; on the dry side, thankfully; none of the sticky sweetness of other imperial hefes; citrus and wheat.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: lively carbonation and citrus acidity at the front; significantly more sticky sugar, chewy malt than the aroma suggests; solid citrus and mineral bitterness trying to balance things out; the chewiness ends up weighing this down as the glass empties: generous German hefe, but I honestly think this would be significantly improved (to the degree of Dancing Man Wheat, which was phenomenal) if the ""imperial"" aspect was removed.  Overly sticky core, but generous and tasty otherwise; clear expression of a big, bad hefeweizen.

Sharp nose with the banana clove you are supposed to get from the German Hefeweizen, but with sugar and cinnimon on top and a much more forward pine resin.  I shouldnt read other peoples reviews first, but I completely get the new carpet smell Buckybeer mentioned.  Wow, this is an odd beer.  There is a strong clove, cinnimon and banana weizen under a veritable pine forest.  The hops fight for dominance in this beer, with candied grapefruit rind, warm orange juice and apricot, but the cloves win out in the end.

Flavor is so multi-dimensional that Im not sure what hit me first.  Sitting here Im sort of struck by this fine creation.  The multi-dimensional characteristics sort of occur simultaneously.  Up front I taste a dry malt, but then the hops seem to be right there, clove and banana, orange, cinnamon, yeast (sort of Belgian like), and a hop linger.

One sniff Ill get a large dose of banana, another time Ill get just pure citrusy hops (more specifically, mandarin orange and grapefruit peel), and another sniff will yield clove and cinnamon with yeast.  The taste is very good as well, and the banana begins things, but then switches to cinnamon and clove, and ends to a nice yeasty/wheat finish.  Then the hops assert themselves and youre left with a lingering bitterness on the tongue.  Really full, chewy mouthfeel.  Wow, this is just excellent.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
3747,"2008-02-17",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2008 [Bottle] Pours hazy orange with a good sized off-white head.  Aroma is citrusy hops, banana, cloves and yeast.  Each time I smell it the balance between these changes, but its always very powerful and nice. Taste is bitter up front, then it quickly changes to banana and clove before going back to the citrusy bitter finish with only a hint of quickly fading banana. Smooth, with a good, thick mouthfeel. Finish could be a little longer. A unique and very enjoyable beer.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"
3747,"2008-02-17",4.0,"Heavy cream and banana,and what the heck is that,at first I thought it was kindergaten glue,but then bam it was Cascade hops, what a strange combination,taste was a blast of the banana, tart wheat, a notice of sidewinding alcohol, and the piney flavor of the hops, slight carbonic bite as the yeast really pumped out the co2 here.Cant get over the extremely fresh hop and banana combination in that aroma. Im not absolutely sure its all coming together,but how interesting","Muskego, Wisconsin, USA","brewblackhole"
3747,"2008-02-17",4.7,"pours a cloudy dark yellow-almost orange with a slight head. Has a nice yeast , hop and citrus aroma. Thick and very smooth on the palate. Starts out with a mild citrus taste followed by a nice yeasty flavor typical of good weizen beers. Ends nicely with a blend the hops and yeast flavor. Brings back memories of my weekends at the Essen House in Madision WI....ahh the good old days!","Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, USA","MartiniFiend"
3747,"2008-02-16",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2008 Pours a cloudy orange gold with a good sized off-white head. Big aroma of bananas, clove, spices, and citrus. Nice sweetness, a little more hop aroma is noticed as I take my first sip. Solid bitterness, but not too much. Sort of like an IPA/hefe mix. Excellent, grab some of this while the aroma is fresh if you can. Update - 3/23/08 - I put a couple in the basement to see how theyd change. I notice a lot more bubblegum in the aroma. The spices and clove are still there, but the banana aroma has decreased. The hops are still there, the whole aroma is a little weaker. The whole aroma profile seems to have changed. If I was rating this for the first time today, I dont think Id give it a 4.4 again, probably a 4 or 4.1. Still very good, but not the experience it was fresh. Doesnt taste anything like a German Hefeweizen should if that is what anyone is expecting.","Minnesota, USA","grimreeser"
3747,"2008-02-14",4.1,"Bottled.  Poured hazy, medium orange with a tall, well-retained cap of off-white head.. just what I wanted to see!  The aroma picked up huge doses of cloves and deep banana upfront, backed by citrus and perfumey hoppage.. odd marriage of big green hops in a heavy wheat beer, but I really dug it.  The flavor had heavy darker banana and pale malts at the base, with pine and citrusy hops and lots of clove around the edges.. felt strong at the end, but the alcohol was never overt.. this was just really good!  Medium-plus bodied on the palate with delightful fluffy carbonation that rolled over the tongue.. spices play well with the yeast and big hoppage.  Excellent experiment!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
3747,"2008-02-14",3.9,"Bottle opened with a rush of carbonation.  Pours cloudy orange with a fluffy and carbonated off white head.  As I pour that familiar banana and clove aroma is very pronounced.  I do detect a slight hop presence in the nose, a hint of pine.  The taste is something all together new almost like weiss part and cascades are fighting with each other.  Sometimes I taste the cloves and bananas and yeast and other times the hops.  Both seem present in the finish.  Bitter finish with some sweetness.  Very unique and interesting brew.  I found myself eagerly wanting to know what I would taste in the next sip.","Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, USA","madcow75"
3747,"2008-02-08",4.1,"Cloudy golden colored liquid. Huge, lasting, off-white head. As close to whole cloves in a brew I have yet to encounter. Amazing scent of cloves, pine and citrus. Hints of wheat and malt along with some menthol, bubblegum  and cinnamon. Over the top weiss aromas, they are all there and either at times overpowering or just hanging around waiting for the your nose to recover from the onslaught. Sweet pine sap start leads to grapefruit and pale malts. Finish and linger are quite sharp with lemon zest and a touch of peach pit along with some dry spice. The linger is dry and nearly to bitter for me, as my mouth starts to feel as if it is packed with dry herbs and hops. Love the aroma and everything up to the linger. so if I drink this quickly and nonstop it is nearly perfect.  An original and quite amazing effort once again from Dan and New Glarus Brewing Co. As it warms the finish and linger do not seem as sharp or perhaps my mouth is numbing. Based on the O.P. this has to be near 7%, yet no alcohol is remotely noted. I think the description is right in that the time is now, yet I wonder if it will mellow like an aged Aventinus.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
