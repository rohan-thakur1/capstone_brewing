Its mostly creamy melon but the white grape and raspberry are noticeable. Medium to full body makes this a juicy, big beer.

Flavor the same with an amazing hoppiness. Average texture. Another awesome beer from Trillium.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
4033,"2016-04-03",4.2,"This was my favorite of the four Trillium beers we opened this session. Cloudy orange pour with smaller head. Flavor is dirty skunk along with insanely funky hop. Guessing this enigma is like galaxy cause it has some light cat pee, cheese, light onion, cantaloupe. grapefruit, and pine resin.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"

4033,"2015-11-28",4.2,"650 ml bottle, thanks to ClarkVV on this bottled on 21 Nov, 2015. Mildly hazy gold color with big, full, thick head. Aroma is awesome! The Australian hops are white grape, herbal with some more fruits, pineapple with mild hay.
Flavor is a pretty much a reflection of the aroma. Every single variant of Fort Point has been off the chain! I love Australian hops and this falls in line with Nelson. Very good!","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

4033,"2015-11-28",4.3,"Thanks Clark for sharing. 750ML bottle. enjoyed @ outside temp so around 40F? this is super cloudy, its this bronze orange 2 finger off-white head. The nose is like this grape-forward, with a ton of tropical fruits. This is insane. Juicy, bright, a lot of pine resin and it has this citrus skin like when you chew on orange skin its this tight acidity. good mouthfeel. insanely awesome. the malt and hop presence is very light and very tame.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
4033,"2015-11-28",4.2,"Dark orange and cloudy. Lots of white foamy head. Smell is orange juice. Taste is pretty juicy with fruits and well balanced bitter hops. So good.","New Hampshire, USA","Heather_B"
4033,"2015-11-27",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2015 750mL bottled and drunk on 11/21/15.Well, this is pretty fresh, thats for sure. Big white head and cloudy appearance as is well-established by now. Great retention.Nose seems less given to any green onion or garlic than the other varieties of Fort Point. Really nice pineapple and kiwi in the nose, with some definite dankness and herbal qualities. Honey and sweet biscuits show through from the malts, balancing nicely. No yeast stink, cat pee or b vitamin here. No alcohol noted.Juicy and very tropical but with an additional dryness that some of the other varieties didnt have. No resin, thankfully and none of that galaxy tang/capsaicin-like quality. Dankness meets guava and key lime in a really nice flavor profile. Awesome texture and balance as always, with tight carbonation and a great creaminess to it. Aside from the regular version, this is my favorite (though they are all so similar).Second bottle, drunk 11/28/15.Ya, I suspected I had underrated this and so I had.  Just much, much more brightly hopped than any of the other variants, by a longshot.  Really unique with watermelon, guava and meyer lemon and just enough bitterness in the flavor.  Perfect texture/carbonation as always.  Probably have the regular Fort Point a bit lower than it should be too.  Will definitely pick up a new bottle of a forthcoming batch of that and rerate it.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4033,"2015-11-25",3.8,"Bottle thanks to FooFaa. Nose is grassy with soft fruitiness. Some light citrus. Moderately hazy golden color with a medium sized white head. Taste is like an orange creamsicle, almost hints of vanilla, subtle bitterness. Very nice.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
4033,"2015-11-23",4.2,"Pours a bright golden yellow, medium fluffy head. Aroma is melon, onion, grass, pineapple, grass. Flavor is the same, gooey fruits, scallion. Really top notch, my first dance with Enigma... Not too scary, I like.","New York, USA","drsandman"
