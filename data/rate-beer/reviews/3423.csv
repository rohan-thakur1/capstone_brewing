3423,"2016-09-12",4.3,"Bottle... This beer rocks! Pours cloudy and copper with no head. The aroma is a fruity and earthy intermingling of sour cherries, damp basement and recently felled oak. Full-bodied with tickling carbonation. The flavor is as sour as Hell, and fruity, with a light sour-cherry component and a rumor of red wine vinegar. Tart, semi-dry finish. Kudos to the South Florida Brew Crew for sharing this world-class beer!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3423,"2016-09-05",4.0,"Bottle shared at Jasons. RIch dark cherry sour and lightly acidic brown that is just spot on and tasty.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
3423,"2016-05-26",4.1,"Bottle from spacecoyote (cheers Carl!) and foolishly consumed alone at home. This is one fantastic Flanders Red. Its acidic and sour, but the oak barrel aging rounds the sharpness out nicely, leaving the beer balanced, funky, tart, and complex. Lots of flavor of sour cherries and fruit, mixed with funky barnyard and acidity. Knockout beer that lives up the hype.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
3423,"2016-02-28",4.2,"Bottle shared, pours ruby brown with small white head. Aromas and flavor are ultra sour and acidic cherry, wood, red grape skins, oak, vitamins, cranberry, and sour candy.

Taste is sour malty, bready, brown sugar, acidic, some oak, pepper, and grapey with a big sour finish. Medium body with high carbonation. Not bad.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
3423,"2015-11-14",3.7,"Bottle @ home, thanks to Steve_0. Pours a red orange appearance with a thin brown head. Aroma has plenty of oak, some leather, caramel, vanilla, and spicy fruit.

3423,"2015-06-28",4.2,"Poured from a bottle. 
Aroma is nice and fruity with good berry, cherry, plum and prune notes. Some medium light oak notes. Nice malt notes of toasted bread, caramel and fainter toffee and hints of treacle. Some light leather notes. 
Pours a brown color with a bit of a burnt amber hue and a small, moderately thick, dark tan head that recedes fairly quickly. Faint lacing and small legs. 
Flavor is moderately acidic with light caramel and faint toffee and toasted bread. Moderate fruit notes with dark cherry and berry being most prevalent, but also some plums. Light oak notes and red wine tannins. A bit of a leather note from the malt. Medium light bitterness and faint alcohol spice. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringnecy and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, this is a really amazing Flanders style beer from the US. Really nice fruit notes and complimentary malt and barrel character. A great beer.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

3423,"2015-06-22",2.8,"750mL bottle, pours a deep dark amber brown with a small white head. Aroma brings out dark vinegar, leather, and oak. Flavour is quite vinegary, with light wood and thin sir fruitiness. Not very convincing. Too much vinegar and a thin palate. Overrated.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

Lots of earthy berry, dusty wood, tart foggy basement funk, leather, roasted grain, cola and a glimpse of cinnamon poking through on the backend. Yummy dark sour with great balance of roast and acidity. Dry finish !","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
3423,"2015-04-20",4.1,"750ml bottle pours hazy dark reddish brown with medium head. Nose is earthy dark tart cherry fruit, light cola, soft funk, oak, vanilla cherry, berries. Taste is Flanders-driven but also combines a soft minerally dusty funk found in many Sante offerings. Light sweetness. Finishes tart low acidity, some musty mashed cherry and earthy wet wood, cola, leather. Great.","Hampton Roads, Virginia, USA","JBPortland"
3423,"2015-04-18",4.0,"Pour is a golden rimmed cola brown with a thin ring of off white head. Nose is a delicate, but every bit a Flanders. Toasty malts, malt vinegar, Apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, vanilla, and a metallic undertone. Thinner palate for a Flanders, which is awesome in my opinion. Rounded and smooth, but with a acrid acetic acid tinge. Taste is all the same as the nose. More refined than most flanders. Great for the style, but not my thing.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
3423,"2015-04-06",4.2,"Bottle @ home, thanks Greg. Mahogany pour with a small khaki head. Nice raisin and cherry fruitiness. Pleasant red wine, leather, and balsamic acidity. Pretty solid aroma. Flavor is good and tangy. Fruit leather, balsamic, and a lot of dark fruits. Tangy vinegar, some oak, and a bit of lemon zest. Slight savory note on the tongue. Really well done.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
