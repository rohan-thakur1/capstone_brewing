193,"2016-02-06",4.0,"Draft. Nitro. Rapp. Nose is hugely chocolate, silkier, sexy, inviting, light vanilla and cake frosting. Deep brown to black pour. Taste is lightly sweet with moderate nuttiness. Some marshmallow, sweet but not cloying. A faint acidity in the finish. Very nice.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
193,"2015-04-08",4.1,"Draft. Black pour with tan head. Halzenut, sweet chocolate and malty aromas. Chocolate takes over, hazelnut as second.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
193,"2015-01-26",3.4,"On tap at Rapp. Pours like a porter. Smell is really nice, sort of like nutella. Flavor is extremely sweet, and it could use a bit more body and roast to support it. But makes a nice dessert beer. Worth a try.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"
193,"2015-01-02",4.3,"Draft... This beer rocks!... Pours tar-black with flashes of deep mahogany and a small, creamy, off-white head. This baby smells a lot like Nutella - pure ambrosia. Medium to full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and lazy carbonation. The flavor is a lush interweaving of bittersweet 85%-cacao chocolate and hazelnuts - pretty much Nutella here too. Lingering chocolatiness and bitterness. Truly a world class beer from the fine folks at Rapp!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
193,"2014-11-29",3.8,"Flippy Growler via Hopscotch, thanks: Deep brown with solid carbonation and head retention, fair lace. Rapper Delight this Chocolate Hazelnut brew with big time nutty overtones, mocha, espresso, atomic bull crap (according to my 10 yo nephew)... Got to admit that the second glass got to be a chore to finish as the hazelnut really started to take over everything. Still a lots of Fudge Sickle, tasty!","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
193,"2014-08-26",4.7,"Draft at Rapp. Looks like a porter. Silky smooth flavor. Vanilla hazelnut glory. Fantastic. No real complaints. Maybe bit too sweet","Florida, USA","Clarkdvm"
193,"2014-08-01",3.6,"Growlah. Robust hazelnut aroma laced with chocolate syrup. Bangin. Smooth and nutty on the palate; flavors flow like buttah.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"
193,"2014-03-23",3.9,"Draft at the tasting room in St. Pete, FL. Snifter. Pours a deep brown, nearly black opaque with a thin eggshell head. Some very mild lacing. The aroma is mostly roasted malt and hazelnut (the Nutella.) Taste is very hazelnut with roasted malts and a hint of vanilla cream. If you like hazelnut, youd like this. If not skip it. Medium body, light carbonation. Clean finish.","Boca Raton, Florida, USA","Fritz123"
193,"2014-03-09",3.7,"Pours unclear thick dark and murky brownish black with a small cream beige head. Aroma brings clean smooth sweet nutty notes, like a fresh hazelnut dream. Flavor brings creamy nutty flavors as well, like a hazelnut wafer in your mouth.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"
193,"2014-02-09",4.2,"Sample from growler at Kurtkeller 005: Coffee-tastic 01 on 02/08/2014. The beer pours a dark brown color with a medium foamy tan head that diminishes gradually. Small patches of lacing on the glass, as well as a bit of staining. Aroma of chocolate, roasted malt and hazelnuts. Medium-bodied with a roasty character and flavors of chocolate malt, hazelnuts and mild coffee. The finish is sweet with a lingering Nutella® aftertaste. As advertised, a tasty beer all around.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
193,"2014-02-01",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 3, 2014 Wow! I want to lick the inside of the glass. This is one SEXY porter. The aroma and palate are out of this world. The flavor is sweet but not sickly. SO DAMN GOOD!","St Petersburg, Florida, USA","wisdomsolo"
193,"2014-02-01",4.4,"I've said it before and I'll say it again-Rapp beats Cigar City time and time again. This is the best porter I've ever had, hands down.

193,"2014-01-30",3.4,"Hazelnut dominates the chocolate and rich malt in taste, and even more so in aroma. A little thin without the bitterness of a porter. More malt and this would be fantastic","","AGknights44"
193,"2014-01-25",3.7,"Snifter pour at the brewery. Nose is sweet dark malts, chocolate, smooth hazelnut. Flavor has mild roasted malts with more sweet chocolate. Hazelnut presence is there for sure. Medium body with a nitro pour. Not a bad drink overall.","Florida, USA","tricyclist"
193,"2013-12-29",3.7,"Tap at Rapp thanks to tastybeer. Pours a clear deep inky red with minimal foam. Nose is decadent Nutella, rich and powerful chocolate hazelnut. Taste is thinner than expected, bright cherry with malted milk ball. Palate is pretty spot on and doesnt go chalky, mealy. Pretty yummy.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
193,"2013-12-25",3.7,"Draft at brewery. Black pour, tan head. No retention/lace. Aroma of hazelnut, peanut butter, chocolate, roast. Taste is chocolate, light hazelnut, coffee, roast. Palate is soft, slick, light sweet finish 7/3/8/4/15","Indiana, USA","tastybeer"
193,"2013-11-11",3.9,"draft at Rapp, Tons of flavors, never had nutella, big chocolate &hazelnut aromas & flavors. Dessert beer, Hazelnut flavors shine & pair phenomenally with the chocolate. Very well made, medium bodied, seek this out","Buffalo, New York, USA","swoopjones"
193,"2013-08-11",4.3,"Wow I loved this beer. Initially, I had mixed feelings about ordering it, but man it was worth it. Big time chocolate and light hazelnut with a touch of earthiness and roast, and some light ash. Sweet aromas. It smelled seriously great. The taste was exactly how it smelled - balanced sweetness, hazelnut, almond, chocolate, roast. Great beer here.","Florida, USA","OmegaX"
193,"2013-08-05",3.9,"This was brew of the day for me. It smelled like Nutella, or even those Ferrero Rocher candies. No point in describing the taste; as it is straight-forward delicous - perhaps more so than the enticing aroma.","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"
193,"2013-04-22",3.5,"Moderately sweet with a faint hazelnut character. Medium body and a bit dry.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
193,"2013-04-22",4.0,"On tap at the Rapp.  Dark brown pour with a mocha colored head.  Huge hazelnut aromas.  Wow.  Smooth and sweet with rich hazelnut and carmel notes.  Nice roasted malt undercurrents.  Good mouthfeel, carbonation, and balance.  My favorite of the Rapp line up..","Florida, USA","50belair"
193,"2013-04-17",3.8,"Tap flight at the brewery.  Still, near black pour. Barely a ring for a head. Smells like Hersheys chocolate syrup. Taste is dark chocolate syrup with a touch of hazelnut at the end. Very chocolaty. Very. Good mouthfeel. Bitter roast lingers. Flavorful and good.","Whalezbro, Illinois, USA","HighWine"
193,"2013-02-11",3.4,"on tap at Cajun Cafe Spring Beer Festival 2012. Pours darkbrown/black with a thin mocha head. Aroma of Hazelnuts, chocolate, coffee and roast. Taste is nutella, its crazy how close it is.  My only knock on this beer is how light it is for a porter.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","jcartamdg"
193,"2013-01-25",3.9,"This dark beer is nutella through and through. A sweet creamy milk chocolate body and taste with hazelnut slight on the aftertaste but sting on the nose. Quite good and very easy drinking.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","Rustyham"
193,"2012-05-01",3.9,"On draft at Cajun Cafe Spring Beer Fest 2012.  Pours a dark porter brown with a tan head.  Nose is roasted malts, chocolate, hazelnuts, and definitely some Nutella.  Flavor is some roast, but earth, chocolate, and a nice presence of Nutella.  Light to medium in body and a great porter overall.  I look forward to having more of this when Rapp opens.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
