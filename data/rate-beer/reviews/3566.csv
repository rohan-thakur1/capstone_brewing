3566,"2017-03-31",3.9,"11.2oz bottle from Prairie Trail Hy-Vee, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Scent of ripe oranges and maybe... peaches? With soft undertones of light beer and seawater. Not a strong smell, but perhaps reminiscent of a walk through an orchard in season. Pours hazy golden yellow with a finger of big bubbly head that dissipates after a few minutes and then reasserts itself as a thin foamy cover. Gentle but steady effervescence rising up from the bottom. Nice lacing as you work your way down the glass. A very pretty gose beer. Creamy malt with some real body to it and seawater up front, followed by a nice mouth-watering tang and orange flavor mid-palate, with a moderate refreshing finish where the peachy qualities assert themselves. Light- to medium-bodied, definitely among the heavier gose beers Ive had in recent years, with excellent carbonation. Mild saltwater astringency, as expected, and still totally refreshing and easy to drink. A magnificent brew! The more I taste it, the more I like it! With all the flavor and character packed into these humble 11 ounces, this gives some of the best goses Ive ever had a real run for their money!

 Kolor:  Jasnopomarańczowy, piwo jest opalizujące. 
 Piana:  Bielusieńka zbudowana z drobnych pęcherzyków powietrza.
Świetnie radzi sobie na powierzchni piwa i ucieka w dół po odpowiednim czasie. Na szczęście pozostawia dla pocieszenia oka liczne kropeczki. 
 Zapach:  Aromat jest głęboko cytrusowy. Skórki pomarańczy, limonki, mandarynki i cytryna.
W oddali lekka zbożowość.
Jest też charakterystyczna kwaśna nuta, która mnie się zawsze kojarzy z ogórkami kiszonymi i kapustą kwaszoną.

Najlepszymi były jak dla mnie Gose z Westbrook Brewing Company oraz Melon Gose z Anderson Valley Brewing Company.
Myślę że to będzie trzecie w komplecie;)
Jego największą zaletą jest niebotyczna pijalność, rześkość i lekkość.
Uwielbiam takie piwa! Mógłbym wypić takich kilka pod rząd i wcale by mi się to nie znudziło.

3566,"2016-05-29",3.8,"A Gose with oranges and hopped with Citra - another one that stretches the traditional features of an old beer style. Curious if this combination works. Thin but stable, off-white, lacing head over a hazy old gold coloured beer with greenish hue. Unusual but, in all, appetizing aroma of yuzu and orange peel rather than sweet orange flesh, though a fruit sweetness is certainly there as well, fitting in perfectly with the fragrant, delicate lime blossom and tangerine bouquet of the Citra; other than that, there is the Sauerkraut accent typifying most Goses and suggestions of raw rhubarb, moldy lemon, white bread, freshly cut sorrel leaves, unripe gooseberry and redcurrant. Lively, estery onset, lots of citrusy fraîcheur but unripe stonefruit as well, vaguely sweetish but more crisply sour, drying and a bit puckering, shortly after which the classic salt accent appears, subtly so and blending in well with the acidity to create a light Sauerkraut-like sensation; lactic tartness prevails and along with the sourish fruit flavors draws a line all the way to the back, bridging a soft, lightly bready malt and wheat background. Carbonation is sharpish but does not numb or distract.  The citrus acidity returns in the finish in a very convincing, utterly refreshing way, as in fresh-squeezed orange and lemon juice, sweeter than lemon but more sour than orange. All the way at the back, an earthy, dim but undeniable hop bitterish touch pops up too, perhaps disturbing this fruity-salty tartness a bit, but adding another layer of flavor to the whole; retronasally, these Citra hops also provide lovely citrus aromas blending in completely with the actual citrus. This is craft beer at its best: we are far removed from the historical Gose here, the salty accent is there but remains subtle enough so as to let the crisp, lively, extremely refreshing citrus acidity do its work, beautifully enhanced by the Citra and by the lactic tartness of the basic beer. I never suspected a Gose could be so... sunny, lets say. Mission accomplished and I will recommend this as a summery quencher: though only 3.8% ABV, this is packed with flavor, elegant and delicate. A fascinating little beer!","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Fersken, mango, noter af hav, æble fylder næsen. 
Smagsindtrykket er syrligt og salt. Samt en smule sødme. Indtryk af grapefrugt. Middel syrlig, let saltet og let sødme. Øllets krop er middel fyldig og karboneringen er ligeledes på et middel niveau. Afslutningen er tør og syrlig. 
En frisk og middel syrlig Gose, som er en helt ny øltype for min smag. En øl velegnet til varme sommerdage /-egne.
