1631,"2012-09-03",2.8,"Bottle. My first sake rating! Clear, very light yellow/green grape liquid. Almost looks like water. Some nice lacing. Aroma of pear, alcohol/acetone, rice and white bread. The booze brings down the score, but the pear-like notes are really nice. Taste is dry (maybe very little sweet) with notes of almonds, white bread, bit rice and not much more. A bit watery. medium bodied. Finishes to the sweeter side with some alcohol burn. Overall, watery and bit boozy but still has nice aspects to it. Dont mind drinking it.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","VsXsV"

1631,"2011-05-05",1.3,"300 ml bottle kindly shared by Sigmund. Crystal clear, colorless with no head. Aroma has vinous notes, and fusel alcohol in it. Flavors are alcoholic and light acidic. Full body. Oily and completely flat. Dry finish verging on astringent.","Mosterøy, NORWAY","abemorsten"
1631,"2011-05-02",2.7,"Not used to taste sake this cold, but I was recommended to try this served chilled. So I did. It pours bright crystal clear - as sake often does. Aroma is as normal quite low when served chilled, but if I take some time and look deep I can perhaps find some sweet flowery notes along with some woody hints and the obvious yeast and rice. Warming stingy alcohol down the throat and ends in a dry finish and watery aftertaste. Could it be some dry almonds I taste as well there? Yeah, I think so. Nice and sweet alcohol aftertaste.","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"
1631,"2011-04-07",1.3,"Second attempt, again sampled thanx to Sigmund. Pours clear as water, slightly oily in glass, strong alcohol aroma, sweet spicy. Taste is milder than suggested by the aroma, not my thing. For heavens sake, give me a beer.","Sandnes, NORWAY","gunnar"

1631,"2010-09-30",1.9,"Bottle. Pours a pale yellow body. Nose is alcohol, rice and hints of perfumed jasmine. Taste is bland, with a soapy, oily palate that doesnt do me no good for sure. Faint almond tones, and some grainy hints but mostly a doughy kind of alcohol taste with hints of soap. Some vague fruity notes hidden in the mid-palate, but all in all this is not a very good drink in my honest opinion, although it is somehow smoother than other sakes Ive tasted which kinda brings it up a little bit.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"
1631,"2010-07-16",3.2,"Bottle. A still, clear, colorless sake. Seems to be a hint of color actually. Oily pour. Some alcohol in the aroma, with apples and pears and some rice. Hints of citrus fruits and a faint cardboard note. Oily and medium bodied, a bit more warming than pleasant. Some sweetness in the flavor, mostly dry though, with a good fruityness. Alcohol and fruityness in the finish. A pleasant one, tasteful, but too evident on the alcohol. 100716","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

1631,"2008-12-19",1.7,"130ml glass served lukewarm with a great sushi meal at Alex Sushi in Oslo. Blank in appearance with a sweet spicy smell and flavour added by some kind of fruit and a bite of anise. Masked alcohol. Went well alongside with the raw fish, but otherwise not impressive. My first sake and maybe again - on a sushi place [Oslo, 18.11.2008].","Tromsø, NORWAY","Rune"
1631,"2008-07-13",3.3,"30cl bottle from Systembolaget (just to keep the streak going). First sake I try besides some disgusting Gekkeikan.

Clean and clear looking, with a clean, sweetish aroma of... feint caramel? Clean taste, again a bit sweetish but reminding me of a very mild and clean gin albeit without any juniper.

I think, anyway...","Falun, SWEDEN","Kalli"
1631,"2008-05-04",3.7,"30 cl bottle bought at Systembolaget. Pours transpearnt with a yellowish glow. Powerful fruity aroma with licorice and alcohol. Tastes rather complex with subdued licorice competing with bread. Medium sweetness. Full-bodied. Nice.","Oslo, NORWAY","thebeertourist"
1631,"2007-11-09",2.3,"Bottle (30 cl) from Systembolaget. Clear, still, and almost without color. Alcoholic, a bit perfumy, with clear notes of rice and perhaps I can sense some tropical fruits as well. Medium bodied and a bit oily mouthfeel. A light acidity in the flavour. This is not my cup of tea.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","ekstedt"
1631,"2007-09-24",2.0,"Clear, halfway between uncoloured and milky, still. Rather disturbing aroma of oxidized rice hulls and stuffy, unpolished grains. Buttery, nutty and quite fragrant, but all along carrying this oxidized note. Rather full bodied, almost sticky à la Basmati. Rather poor example I found, but my experience is very limited indeed.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1631,"2007-09-20",3.4,"Overflowing cup in a Watame in Tamachi. Clear, thick legs, nose of fresh koji and a  creamy rice note. The flavor has a light buttery character with a not so overpowering alcohol note to round out the acidity. Nice clean flavor, not as much in the bouquet department. Decent, woody and full with character. Bubble gum tasting finish. Kampai!","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1631,"2007-08-04",3.4,"Picked up a 1800 ml bottle from Haskels in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Served chilled. Pours a clear, crystal water color. Aroma of faint pear, a touch of lychee and alcohol. Taste is slightly dry, light fragrance, with an alcohol burn. More alcohol finish than a sweet streamed rice flavor.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
1631,"2006-04-03",3.4,"Tasted along with the Gold Futsu and the Karakuchi Junmai. This one presents a bready character to the nose, more than the regular (or basic) Gold. Taste is sharper and more straight forward, while the body is cleaner than the regular Gold.
[Sampled at salon des vins, Montréal 2006, slightly cold ~10C]","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Siroy"
1631,"2006-04-01",3.3,"Like the gold, this has still lots of bready character in aroma, like wet dough rising. Cleaner taste in mouth, less sweet, more sharpness. Supposedly, they clean the rice more from its hull and outer layer, resulting in this cleaner, more subtil taste. At Salon des Vins et Spiritueux de Montréal, March 25 2006.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
1631,"2006-01-01",2.9,"A clear sake with a sweet aroma of flowers. The flavor is sweet with light notes of alcohol, and rice. I found it rather simple","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
1631,"2004-09-11",4.0,"Sweet rice nose, w/fruit and faint apple. Light w/ mid sweeetness and a lingering finish. Alcohol present on finish, with a tangy element that is nice, though not that well balanced.","Barcelona, SPAIN","obisbeer"
