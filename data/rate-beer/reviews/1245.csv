1245,"2017-06-14",3.6,"Pours dark brown with a large head.
Nose shows cocoa, sweet toasty and bready malt, raisins, chocolate fudge, soft peppery notes and delicate coffee.
Flavours include more coffee, some soft cocoa, sultanas, golden syrup and follows with a harsh bitterness and a a chalky, dry finish.
Carbonation is very aggressive for the style of beer.
I usually absolutely adore doppelbocks but this one mostly missed what make the style so awesome - this intense, rich and sweet bready malt notes.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Davros"

1245,"2017-03-19",3.5,"Bottle. Teku. Pitch black with moderate to high thick, light brown head. Perfect lacing and head retention. Heavy malty aroma up-front, typical - bread, caramel. Moderately fruity, nutty. Moderately roasted. After warming up light booziness is all-around. Cant find any dates, neither figs. Taste is heavy sweet and moderate to light heavy bitter, pretty balanced. The bitterness is long, increasing and quite noticeable in the aftertaste. Medium to full body, oily and thick texture, soft to average carbonation. In overall nice, thick and malty brew with quite strong for that style bitterness. Once again too roasted beer my by Tool, lower fermentation is not their strongest point.","Sosnowiec, POLAND","BlazerT"
