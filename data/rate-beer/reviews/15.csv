15,"2017-06-22",3.8,"Odd that I hadnt rated this before. Gorgeous hazy yellow gold color, not cloudy enough to hide that sparkle twirling up from the bottom of the glass. Fulsome, sticky, ice cream foam bulging over the rim of the glass. Bubble gum, ripe banana, orange creamsicle, and some green peppercorn phenolics. Soft and gently sweet but balanced by a light tangy acidity, low bitterness, sparkling carbonation on medium-full body. Simultaneously lively and creamy. That light acidity keeps it refreshing, barely. This was the sort of beer that helped convert me to variety 15-20 years ago. These days Im almost never in the mood for a Weißbier... too sweet, I want more bite. But its easy to appreciate the well-made ones.","Berlin, GERMANY","JoeinDahlem"

15,"2016-10-19",3.7,"Data ważności: 30.08.2017 
 Kolor:  Złoty. Oczywiście piwo jest całkowicie i bezwzględnie mętne. 
 Piana:  Jak na najlepszego pszeniczniaka na świecie - piana nie jest wcale okazała.
Jest biała, drobnopęcherzykowa, średniowysoka, żeby nie powiedzieć niska jak na taki stylowy Weizen Glass. 
Bardzo niemrawo oplata ścinki szkła. Lacing co najwyżej na 3 z plusem.
Piana uleciała w dół w szybkim tempie i zatrzymała się na granicy kilku milimetrów. 
 Zapach:  100% pszenicy w pszenicy. Wyrazisty, intensywny aromat tego zboża. Stylowo aż do bólu. Mocna drożdżowość, lekko przypieczona skórka od chleba, guma balonowa, banany.
W tle leciutki cytrus, a za nim trochę pieprzowej pikantności.
Goździki wychodzą dopiero po ogrzaniu. Jest ich więcej po przelaniu piwa do szkła.
Jest klasycznie, dokładnie tak jak powinno być. 
 Smak:  Smak jest stylowy, aczkolwiek brakuje tutaj intensywności kilku elementów.
Wybija się ponad przeciętność drożdżowość piwa. Dopiero daleko za nią jest banan, trawa cytrynowa, cytryna i chleb pszenny.
Guma balonowa traci na intensywności. Goździki wypierany jest troszeczkę przez pieprz.
Ta pieprzowa pikatneria na finiszu fajnie komponuje się z drożdżowym charakterem tego Weizena.
Goryczka jest znikowa.
Półpełne ciało i bardzo wysoka pijalność.
Weizen jak najbardziej na propsie. 
 Wysycenie:  Żywe, wysokie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Nie mam aż tak dużego doświadczenia z Hefeweizenami. Piłem ich zaledwie kilkanaście w swoim życiu.
Mówcie co chcecie, ale lubię Paulanera ;)
Weihenstephaner może nie jest najlepszym pszeniczniakiem jakiego piłem (w tej kategorii wygrywa wciąż Maisels Weisse) ale w dalszym ciągu jest bardzo dobrym przedstawicielem stylu.
Charakteryzują go unikalne cechy takie jak: wysoka drożdżowość, akcenty chleba pszennego, banan, goździk, lekkie cytrusy, guma balonowa czy przypieczona skórka od pieczywa.
Jest wysoka pijalność, jest orzeźwiający klimat - wszystko na swoim miesjcu.
Polecam pić jak najbardziej świeże.

15,"2016-08-03",4.9,"500ML bottle. Pours beautiful cloudy orangey yellow with large creamy head. Excellent retention. Aroma is orange peel, lemon, coriander, pumpkin, butternut, nut and spice. Taste is exquisite; citrus and yeast partner perfectly with the palate, corroborating with the aroma. The mouthfeel is lovely. Its beautiful and thick and boasts a 5.4% alcohol content, but seems so much lighter. Very easy to drink as a session beer but the first pint should be drank slowly, savoured and admired.

What initially apealled superior quality control in a first moment, later sounded more like a restrain on creativity and, specially, difference. To my humble perception most of the german beers all tastes the same. I wrote this to be assured that the reader would not waste time reading a review of an unbiased person. Having said that, this is a good beer. Not special by any means, but a good beer. As a weiss beer it is exactly what I expected: beautiful, refreshing and very drinkable. It really smells a little like banana, and it is very light. You can feel some bready like after taste. But dont look for much more than that. At least it is the best aromatic german beer I ever smelled, because they all smell pretty much the same to me. Cheers","","rvzx"

Beautiful foamy beer with a discreet but delicate aroma of banana and wheat. Other wheat beer smells more towards like freshly baked bread, but Weihenstephaner is therefore more green with fresh immature wheat grain. The taste is rich of ripe banana, but without the sweetness of taking too much. It is a little spicy of coriander and a little clove, again in a manner which seasoning does not take over either banana sweetness or its fresh thirst-quenching wheat malt embossed twist. Everything is in perfect balance, actually so perfect that it is almost scary perfect. All hefeweissbier I will taste in the future will be in deep contrast to this masterpiece.

Smells of ripe banana, red apple skin, together with grassy hops and white pepper. Banana shines through beautifully, while balanced by the hops and a coppery whiff, remaining the beers enjoyable balance.

Drinks incredibly smooth, carried by soft yeast, feels utmost silk on the palate, while providing enough carbonation to create an refreshing impression. 

Begins with cakey malts, clove, honey and a fantastic yeast smoothness, establishing the beers world-class mouthfeel. While the spices are prominent, they do get tamed by earth, a glimpse of oak and the grassy, slightly herbal hops. Finishes with young banana, more clove and honey, while the hops provide a pleasant, refreshing herb presence.

The interplay between noteable carbonation and euro hops turns out great, as the beer dont need no bitter hop punch to balance the sweeter spices, but uses the metallic qualities from the carbonation to create a short, refreshing burn, taming the sweeter ingredients of the brew. As easy as this drinks, as convincing is the beers receipt, showcasing a truly well made Weissbier, which leaves a refreshing, perfectly balanced impression on the palate.","GERMANY","aleigator"

The flavor is musty, horsey malts; slightly sour yeast funk; tart citrus like lemon, blood orange and tangerine. There is a lemongrass finish, with an end of dried leaves. A touch of pink bubblegum.

Biscuit malt base on the nose is joined by notes of orange, honey, banana and some sort of cream. Bread and biscuity (think Jacobs cream crackers or some sort of pretzel) dominate the taste. Definitely not one for when refreshment is the priority. Not really getting much else other than maybe a little bit of honey or banana. Carbonation is fairly potent and mouth feel is quite dry. Curiously enough there seems to be virtually no taste on the back end (i.e. back of the tounge and the throat) and certainly not any major bitterness to speak of. This is a style Im largely unfamiliar with so I dont know if its a trademark of the style or not, but its odd to me nonetheless.

Lots of yeastiness and wheat, this really does define the style pretty damn well. The flavor is a bit of a let down from what I want from the style though. It comes across as a bit too thin and watery with not quite enough depth from the yeast. The esters just arent there in the flavor. It just tastes a bit flat and boring. Some light fruitiness and a touch of lemon on the finish. Lighter bodied with soft fizzy carbonation.

Look: Pours with a massive white head, slow retention to a foamy ring, leaves a sticky excellent lacing. Cloudy yellow wheat with light orange hue. Lots of carbonation. Cant get sexier that this. 


Smell: Clove. Wheat, bread sweetness. Spicy. Earthy yeast. Light banana and a hint of lemon. Basically what defines this style, did expect a bit more banana, but doesnt matter really. 


Taste: Smell pretty much translates into taste + light hop bitterness. Clove start is the most obvious, also some spice light banana, apple. Then goes in to crackers medium sweet wheat middle. Ends with earthy yeast with light bitterness and some banana esters. Cant really think of a more perfect blend of tastes, no wonder this one defines the style.

Posee una espuma abundante, muy densa, firme y cremosa que debidamente servida, corona de forma espectacular su vaso característico de servicio.
Tiene una alta concentración de Co2, lo que la conserva perfectamente y no pierde fuerza incluso un gran rato después de su servicio.

Su sabor es mas que delicioso, desde el primer trago nos impacta en el paladar con todo su sabor a trigo malteado, donde si se mantiene el mismo en boca unos segundos se notan trazos florales y algo especiados con un regusto dulzón al final del trago pasando de puntillas.

Taste: This is really nicely balanced, not as pungent as the aroma, but the flavors are all here. Crisp wheat provides a clean light citrus while the yeast gives very light banana on the intro and throughout with a very light spice on the finish. This is a great summer beer, very refreshing.

The Weihenstephaner had the largest head, initially, but it quickly dissipated. Swirling would kick-up new foam each time. Exquisite aromas of banana and bubblegum, and unlike the other two, this one smelled of clove and faint noble hops. Mild malt and wheat, light breadiness, with more complex grain flavors than the others.. Not buttery like the Paulaner. A bit fuller-bodied with a very nice subtle, grainy, mineral water hardness.

15,"2012-06-18",3.8,"500ml bottle into a weizen glass. Pours a cloudy light golden color with lots of rising bubbles. HEAPS of head, and almost overflowed when I opened it. The head is dense and velvety, and fades very slowly. The nose is of banana, yeast and a slight  amount of clove. Very complex palate. Begins with a bit of banana and some sweetness. Progresses to some slightly malty flavours in the mid palate with roasted wheat coming through. The finish has a slight spiciness to it, mild herbacious hop flavour, a bit of an acid kick and a spritz of carbonation that leaves your mouth tingling. Finish is good and long, leaving a nice coating in your mouth and tending towards those roasty flavours again as the finish tapers off.
Mouth feel is fizzy and slightly creamy, with a little bit of a buzz as it slides down your throat. Wonderful balance of flavours, and really easy to drink and enjoy. This is really an amazing beer, and it deserves its high status.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Niksko"

Looks great, orangey coloured cloudy body, huge head, bubbles arising, just like a good hefeweiss should.

The aroma is also huge, vanilla, bananas and toffee apples, very impressive.

15,"2012-03-01",3.9,"From notes.  First reviewed 2/2/2011.  Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a tulip. Drinking from the worlds oldest brewery tonight.

This is an aggressively carbonated beer. A massive white, tightly carbonated and creamy head floats on top of an inviting hazy golden tangerine beer. Great retention, and a sheet of lace slides down the glass.

This is quite the balanced aroma for a Hefeweizen. Banana, clove, wheat, some white grape and green apple skin. It is very aromatic, with a flowerlike quality to it, although I get no specific floral aroma.

The start of the sip is bananas drizzled with honey. A dash of cloves, and some white grapes and tart green apple skin add some tartness. A touch of spicy hops is the finishing touch. The finish is dry and a touch bitter but otherwise cleans up well. 

Mouthfeel: Extremely bubbly, this is very intensely carbonated. The beer doesnt wander around my tongue, it dances. This gives it quite a light mouthfeel. It is light bodied and although the front has some quite dry as well.

15,"2012-01-29",4.8,"A beer that Ive claimed over the past few years as one of my top ten favorites, tonights beer is the Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier.  Brewed in Bavaria, Germany, Weihenstephans label states that its the oldest brewery in the world. Records date back to the year 768 with documents mentioning a hop garden, but the brewery was officially licensed in 1040.

The 17oz bottle pours at a clear burnt-amber color, with a nice thick ivory white foam on top.  The foam lingers for several minutes, and leaves behind a mild lacing as it recedes. The aromas are bright and distinct, with plenty of lemon, orange peel, banana, and spices. I absolutely love the aromas on this little Hefeweiss!

On the palate, the Weihenstephaner is flavorful and complex, yet so incredible easy to drink! The citrus and banana is right up front in my mouth, but not far behind is the spice and just a touch of alcohol. This is an absolutely delicious brew that I highly recommend for anyone who ever considered those mediocre mass-produced imitations.","Connecticut, USA","TheCorkStops"

15,"2011-12-31",3.7,"Bottle - Pours hazy golden amber with a thick white creamy, foamy head. Nose is bold, rich banana and juicy tropical fruit, a touch of clove, and a thick yeastiness. Taste emphasizes the sweet fruity notes, overripe banana, lots of yeasty bread, and a touch of plastic and clove. Smells great, but the taste really falls short. A little too carbonated also, but overall pretty smooth. Man, this would be fantastic if the taste matched the aroma.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
15,"2011-12-29",3.6,"Presents a delicious aroma: citrus, spice, slight banana and, of course, fermented wheat and its signature yeast. Looks like any other hefe, but character is more profound.Taste is spicy, sweet and bitter in roughly that order. This is no revolution; in fact it is one of the originals. Again, the high score is based on the degree to which these elements come together.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","Scrapersnbeer"
15,"2011-12-29",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 15, 2012 On tap at Csakajósör, Budapest. Hazy pale color beer with white rocky head. Sweet fruity citrus aroma because of the yeast. Some wheat flavour also appears, but the yeast is the dominant. Interesting refreshing light bitter taste with malty sweetness. Medium body with creamy texture and lively carbonation.

15,"2011-12-27",4.6,"500 ml bottle.

Thick lacing clings around the glass as well, incredible.  Aromas of big banana, clove, bubblegum, pepper, lemon, and spicy yeast.  Fantastic aromas here with great balance and strength.  Taste of big clove, pepper, banana, bubblegum, lemon, bread, and spicy yeast.  Light bitterness on the finish that lingers with citrus, pepper, banana, and spices for a bit.  Extremely smooth and slightly creamy medium sized body.  Fairly lively carbonation that dies down as I make my way through the glass.  Extremely well balanced with the flavor profile as well.  Overall this is an absolutely incredible wheat beer; and the definition of a hefeweizen in my opinion.

 It enters your mouth with a smooth, lightly sweet taste of  a soft bread like and smooth soft mild citrus spice finishing with  a good kind of subdued light carmel toasted  fresh bread made from an age old recipe that doesnt  exist anywhere else.Then leaves you with a mild spice carmaly vanilla dry very mild citrus.","Iowa, USA","jmohno"

Appearance: Cloudy orange with magnificent, billowing white head that leaves some nice lacing behind.

Aroma: Strong sweet banana bread at first, but turns very dry and clove-like after a few minutes.

Taste: Fantastic wheat malts augmented by mostly banana at first and then cloves and noble hops carry through on the long finish. Never enjoyed the actual wheat taste from a beer so much.

Palate: High carbonation, light to medium body, very crisp and dry.

The brew is an inviting hazy yellow. This one had a strong wheat flavor and is slightly sweet, with a faint hint of citrus. It is light on the palate despite the initial carbonation burn. A very nice, yeasty wheat brew.","Villa Park, Illinois, USA","Wolfenkopf"
15,"2011-08-31",3.7,"It looks like a perfect hefeweizen: it pours a hazy, light yellow, sparkling body that is filled with tiny bubbles. A huge, dense, creamy white head builds up easily, reduces to half a centimetre in a couple of minutes, and stays at that size until the glass is empty. Excellent lacing. An unusually intense aroma with lots of banana, spices, yeast, fruits and sweet honey. The taste is medium sweet and light acidic with some additional bitterness in the finish. A very long, spicy aftertaste with sweet honey and caramel notes. Medium body, lively carbonation and a rather dry finish. By far the best hefe-weizen Ive tried so far, with intense aroma and flavours and a lovely mouthfeel!

It has the sweetness and yeast to represent the style like it should. For other beers I would describe all around aspects but for this, I remarkably, have nothing to say. It is the perfect Hefe.

It poured beautifully into my weizen with a 4 finger thick frothy / foamy white head. Head retention was impressive and lots of lacing hugged the glass.

The aroma epitomizes the style - I get some faint banance, cloves, wheat, yeast, and bready notes. Typing it cant describe the ""x factor"" present. I have had other beers with these players but they dont come together like in this gem.

The taste mimcs the aroma and again has banance, cloves, wheat, and yeast notes. The taste has a slightly sweet element and is very refreshing. The finish is dry and leaves you wanting more. Top notch.

The mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied. It was quite effervescent with moderate carbonation.

If you have access - there is truly no reason to wait to try this. It should be purchased and consumed regularly throughout all warmer months.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","gramity"

Flavor is very similar- banana, clove, sugar, sweet and bready malts, wheat, and cereal. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a dry, sweet, grainy mouthfeel and dry finish.

Smell - Light and refreshing floral banana smell.

Taste - Very light and springy with refreshing subdued fruit complexity. Balanced spice, and subtle alcohol.

Mouthfeel - Spritey spice feel, goes down very smooth.

Drinkability - Could drink this all night. Not heavy, and complex enough to keep me coming back for more.

Mouthfeel is much creamier than some other German Weizens, which become dusty and gritty towards the end of the glass.

Very nice apperance. An orangey beer in the middle, but it has more white-yellow edges / hue, and almost looks like a darkened witbier or something like that. Head is huge at first, but then it falls, though it remains to exist as a small, dense, white head. Aroma is banana and hay; all the usual stuff, but seems a bit more malty. Nice. Flavor is banana at first which is very pleasant; then comes some hay and rubber together with a certain bitterness from the hops that appears more distinct than in many other hefeweizens which is also pleasant, and at last we have the alcohol that is also more distinct than in other hefes. Surprisingly thin and watery. I had expected a creamier beer and prefer the palate of ex. Franziskaner over this beers palate. Refreshing as hell. A nice hefen, but lacks palate.","Nysted, DENMARK","flemmingwillum"

A-Pours a hazy saffron with an incredible head of bright white foam thats three fingers high. As the head melts its amazing retention fades slowly leaving large chasms in its top and laying down amazing sheets of lace leaving the glass look just like spent bubble wrap. stellar simply stellar.

S-Smells of delicious banana nut bread almost.... with hints of bubblegum and wheat. No alcohol apparent at all.

T-The taste is stellar. All banana and wheat sweetness that tastes delicious. There is an extremely clean finish with no bitterness at all.

M-The mouthfeel is silky smooth with just enough carbonation to keep things exciting. 

D-This beer is amazingly drinkable. I have yet in my life to find a better hefe than Weihenstephaner. I have compared all others to this so far. If I was rating on a scale of 5 to the style this would easily be across the board. The smells erupt from the glass the taste is not only dead on for the style but also downright explosive for a wheat beer. The drinkability is both flawless and dangerous as you will require to buy more of this before you are ready if your not careful. A sixteen oz bottle can last no more than 5 minutes if youre not paying attention.","tallahassee, Florida, USA","Brewfus"
15,"2010-11-27",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2012 A: Slightly-hazed orange with a pretty nice head and good lacing.

S: Sweet grains and some spiciness paired with beautiful hefe yeast.

T: Some spiciness to balance out the sweet malt background. The spiciness seems to come from a bit of clove, and then there is some definite banana with hints of vanilla. 

M: Medium body with a good amount of carbonation.

The nose gives assertive notes of banana, along with a much more muted note of residual malt sweetness.  The other classic flavor/scent of the style, clove, makes its appearance on the palate, showing throughout, along with a more restrained banana.  The finish is estery, without being unappetising, and leaves the drinker quickly reaching for another sip.  Overall, it is easy to see why this is seen as the archetype of the style.  Pleasant in the extreme.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

15,"2010-06-23",3.6,"Best before 04/03/2009 and poured in my Erdinger Weizen glass (originally rated December 2008). Says ""The worlds oldest brewery"" on the front label. This hefe has a cloudy, golden-beige-orange colour with a big white creamy head, long retention, and patches of lacing. Smooth oat aroma with some nice spices, German wheat yeast and banana. Well-balanced mouthfeel, between refreshing, but not watery, having a little stickiness, but again, not too much. Tastes like a hefe, but a little different from others Ive had before. Starts off a little on the bitter side, and then, kind of falls flat, with the mild yeast in the finish. Not your typical bubblegum sweet flavour. Well brewed (does not look like a mass-produced beer) but not to crazy, making this one a good session beer.

Cloudy weak metamusil colour with a thick off white cap with no retention issues. Smell and taste are both complex and subtle. Very very floral. Fresh lemonyness with a very mild yet obvious banana aroma that has cocoa qualities to it. Cloves. This is a very interesting spice. Soft yeasty notes join in - everything is blended so well smellwise. My mouth is greeted to a succulent treat indeed. Quick flash of banana lasted a micro second only to pop up again mid to mid-late. Medium spices and cloves, bit of lemony funk as an undertone. Wow - doing a forceful mouth swish between the teeth brings forward even more flavour including a solid spice power, light orange that fades in and out, hints of hops keep showing up, lightly acidic. Great mouth feel - smooth, has a great carbonation to it, soft, goes mild through to the finish with soft spices, yeast and light fruit. An excellent beer - now I feel like drinking heavily.

15,"2010-06-10",4.6,"Aroma: Different than I was expecting. I have just finished the Krystal and I remember it having a very robust nose full of yeast and herbs. this beer is more subtle. Im getting a faint citrus with very mild herbal notes.Theres more of a bready malt character to this beer too. 
Appearance: Fantastic! I really do love to see a big frothy head on top of a glass of hefe! This beer is murky with yeast and the color of a golden retriever; blond in parts amber in others. 
Taste/Palate: Very pleasant but again surprisingly subtle. After having the Krystal Im blown away by the relaxed nature of this beer. I was figuring an even more robust ale with bursting flavors and Im getting a subtle yet complex, well balanced, relaxed smooth drinking hefe. There are spice characteristics like nutmeg and clove, and a sharp hop character right down the center of my palate. The acidity is great and it compliments the carbonation and body to make a truly refreshing delight. I really am just blown away with how dry this beer is in comparison to its companion the Krystal.

15,"2010-04-30",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 20, 2012 My favorite types of beers are those that dont taste like typical beer. I prefer an authentic, niche, well-crafted style even if its not the easiest beer to drink. Of course, not all beers that fall into that category are automatically masterworks, such as Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier. This is a beer whose reputation precedes it, and for the most part it lives up to the hype.POUR, COLOR AND AROMAWheat beers tend to flow very smoothly out of the bottle, as this one did. However, trying to pour the beer itself is quite a challenge. Whether poured down the side or the center of the glass, this brew forms a huge layer of fluffy, bright white, marshmallow-like head. The head lingers throughout the life of the beer and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass.The complexion is a dark orange/amber hue which is, not surprisingly, extremely hazy with some miniscule sediment noticeable. The aroma is potent with clove and banana and overall very sweet-smelling.TASTEWeihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier has a very sweet palate which isnt quite as spicy as I would have liked. It has a strong taste of banana and clove noticeable from the first sip to the last swig. The liquid itself has a slightly grainy texture, making it drink more like a hearty beer than a gimmicky, novelty beverage. The only caveat is clove might be a bit too strong for me, as I probably wouldve preferred a more intense, juice-like taste, but the overall palate here is definitely clean.FINISHThe great thing about wheat beers like this is how much softer in the mouth they tend to be than typical lagers and ales. There is definitely no hop bite here, so this beer goes down extremely smooth. Combined with the sweet taste, Hefe Weissbier would make a great introductory hefeweizen.BODYIf the cloudy body is off-putting to the lightweight drinker, they should consider how easy the beer is to drink and the fact its a very light beer. At 5.4% ABV, Hefe Weissbier is only a little stronger than your mass-market brew, and is likely equal or even lower in calories and carbs (sorry, I couldnt find those stats). FINAL THOUGHTSA beer like Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier is probably the best example of what a truly authentic German wheat beer should be.NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD4ZAg20d5I","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
15,"2010-04-28",3.7,"500 mL bottle from the LCBO, served in a Weizen glass. Pours hazy amber with a tall white frothy head. Head fades slowly, leaving some lace. Starts off with a powerful aroma of yeast and clove along with banana, grass and a touch of citrus. Flavour is moderately sweet throughout, with a touch of bitterness towards the end. Finish is moderate in length and fairly malty. On the palate, light-medium in body with a smooth, milky texture. Highly carbonated, but with tiny bubbles that do not detract from the smooth texture. Overall, a fine hefeweizen. I would have liked a little more lace, but the aroma is very inviting. Smooth and drinkable.

S- Good, Light, and typical for a hefe. Great balance of sweet bready yeast, clove, and banana. Hints of citrus also emerge.

T-Very similar to the smell. Perfect balance of sweet bready yeast, clove, and banana. Hints of floral hop and citrus emerge for the finish-but are very faint. Sweet bready yeast and some clove linger long after the sip. Taste is very light.

P- Wonderful light, smooth, and creamy body based on yeast. Light carbonation accompanies this.

O- This is a classic example of a hefe. It has everything that should be found in one and keeps it all in balance without anything extra added. Has the high drinkability and enjoyability that one should have. It was a bit on the expensive side for the bottle. I can see myself having more affordable great German hefes like Hacker-Pschorr and Franziskaner more often but I will treat myself to this one again.

15,"2010-03-04",4.2,"I have never been a fan of hefeweizens. Lately though, I have been sampling quite a few, esp. German examples, to see if I couldnt learn a little more about them and maybe figure out for sure what it was I didnt like. As it turns out, most hefeweizen just arent very good. They are clumsy, dull representatives of the style. W/ Weihenstephaner, this is not the case at all. This hefeweizen is a big, vibrant and flavorful beer. It is only slightly hazed and pours a lovely golden w/ a big white head. A fresh, almost exaggerated banana presence is the centerpiece of the nose w/ coriander-like citrus notes in the background. Soft sweetness is tempered by vigorous but gentle carbonation. Comes off pleasantly thick w/ a slight, oily slickness. Cloves and some floral hoppy notes make themselves known as you dig deeper.

Lots of malted wheat and barley with notes of spices and banana in the nose. Hints of lemon and light phenols.

A rather soft but prominent malt presence of barley and wheat dominates the flavor. Lots of white bread and crackers. Well balanced flavors of banana and spices (cloves) take over in the middle. Notes of yeast with an earthy twang. The finish is gentle and a bit short with lots of mild spicy notes, some phenols and a light fruitiness. A minimal taste of alcohol in the finish as well. No real bitterness.

Medium body, not very crisp due to the gentle carbonation.

This is a hard beer for me to review since I generally have a problem with hefeweizens - I dont really like the style. Im often underwhelmed by their flavors, short finish and mouthfeel. That being said, I think this one is quite good and I can see why its conceived of as a real classic. It has a well balanced character, and both spices and fruit esters are pleasant and kept at bay (in some hezeweizens they are too prominent in my opinion). Easy to drink and refreshing, but its not very interesting or exciting.

Smell: The nose is sweet and full of fruity yeast with notes of banana, bubble gum and wheat malt.

Taste/Mouth: There are bready and yeast flavors up front with banana notes and a touch of clove coming through. The finish has pleasant tangy wheat and very mild hop bitterness which give it some dryness. The palate has a refreshing, easy drinking medium body with nice active carbonation and a lively crisp texture.

The flavor consisted of mild banana and some lightly spicy yeast.  Everything that the nose displayed seemed muted or toned down a notch.

I tried this beer on May 31, 2008 after purchasing from the Queens Quay LCBO outlet in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The beer poured a hazy orange colour with a generous bubbly head.  The aroma was mild wheat, some hops, and some spiciness with a malty feel.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied, slippery, with a lot of carbonation.  The flavour was sweet and spicy with wheaty, malty, and soime fruit tones in the mix.","Milton, Ontario, CANADA","cyrenaica"

Even better with the brunch left-overs of same... hey you want to taste real Bavarian, try this in the AM with some extremely fresh Weisswurst and hot-from-the-oven Bretzeln.

15,"2008-05-31",3.9,"500ml bottle from the LCBO. Pours the ideal looking Hefe, with a huge white head. Aroma: Yeasty to the max, what can I say, its a Hefe, think all the good characteristics of one. Flavour: See Aroma. Haha, well its a tad sweeter than some other Hefes Ive had, but in this case it helps balance the sour bite of the yeast. Malty, no hops whatsoever, plenty of citrus, nice spicy bite in the finish, a touch of clove. Not as much banana as I tend to like, but the key here for me is the moderate effervescence, because overly carbonated Hefes are just terrible (and almost killed me once). Ladys and gentlemen, for my 300th rating, I give you, Bavarian Wheat Beer. The first time a milestone rating has actually been anything decent for me. After a bad experience with too much Hefeweizen, I went through a period where it made me nauseous. This beer has changed that, and allowed me to enjoy the style again!

Bottle brown 500 ml
Very deep, intensive and lively colour as for a HefeWeizen denoting a good brew. Aroma is fully expressed and pronounced. Carbonation is strong and intensive, there is a great ammount of vivid bubbles forming dense rocky snowy white head. Flavour has all you expect from one of the best weizen. It is just typicall and proper, very grainy, wheaty and barley flavoured too. There is no extra strange flavour typical for some odd Hefeweizens. Only those recognized and some banana. Its not that yeasty as Paulaner, not clementine like as Erdinger but just proper and on a very high level.","Zawiercie/Sosnowiec, POLAND","sirPino"

A: Pours a gorgeous hazy, tawny, gold, with a huge rocky white head, which in turn seems to last forever & a day. I think I could take a nap on this beers head. Throughout the beer, it leaves behind huge chunks of lacing that remind me of the Archipelegos.

S: Yeast is right there in your face, lots of cloves, bubblegum and a slight tart lemony scent are all present too. Some nice fresh-baked bread brings it all together, this is an amazing smelling beer.

T/M: Sweetness hits the tip of the tongue immediately, but not cloyingly so. Followed by a very creamy, almost buttery body and some nice citric bite. Loads of bready malt & cereal grain flavors combine with the tanginess of the wheat and lead to a enjoyably astringent finish. A delicious beer that often winds up being gulped and not sipped.

This beer is extremely mellow. Every flavor blends immaculately with the next. Soft banana and clove flavors meet honey, lemongrass, very subtle hops, a faint hint of pear skin, a bubblegummy note, cereal grains. Deeper than your average hefe.

It is hazy gold with a huge, dense, thick white head that lasts forever.  The aroma is honey and pears.  The palate lively.

Flavor is rich, typical of a wheat beer but mouth-filling - no ""thin"" feeling whatsoever. I got a strong hint of citrus, but again this may have been due to the lemon wedge in the beer.

Cloudy hay colored brew.  The aroma is of banana and spices.  The sweetness along with that banana yeasty flavor impart something that is unlike any other type of beer.

Hefes arent my favorite style but Ive been in the mood for one today and what better way to go than Weihenstephaner? Pours a hazy yeast laden golden. The entire glass fills with big carbonation bubbles that speed to the creamy bright white head that forms on the pour. Leaves moderate lacing after each sip. A very nice looking hefe.

The smell is 100% hefe. The benchmark for others. Green bananas have a big spot in the aroma with clove coming in a close second, very spicy. Possibly some white pepper. Solid wheat twang backbone with a drop or two of lemon juice. Smells great. 

Flavor is spot on with the aroma. The banana is leaning more toward banana bread as opposed to green bananas. Clove with a twangy wheat backdrop and the lemon shows again.. 

Lighter bodied with a highly carbonated creamy mouthfeel. Very thirst quenching.

On a warm summer day like today this is about one of the easiest drinkers to find. Thirst quenching and enjoyable.

To me Weihenstephaner is the pinnacle all other hefes try and reach. Like I said not one of my favorite styles but when Im in the mood none are better than this.

15,"2007-06-29",3.8,"From a 500mL Bottle.  A hazy tower of golden honey fills my weizen glass, transitioning nicely from a pale pear skin color at the bottom to a richer blood orange fog at the top.  Two fingers of soapy white foam rests calmly on top, attractively, but a taller, rockier head would make it even better.  Aroma of creamy banana yeast phenolics; very light and milky with an almost vanilla ice-cream like bread pudding character.  Not much in the way of spice aromatics, but it doesnt need it; simple, elegant, and clean.  A hint of lemon acidity adds a refreshing element to the bouquet.  Light bodied, spritzy carbonation that explodes on the palate in a burst of sizzling bubbles.  Theres a bit more yeasty spice in the flavor than found in the aroma; less banana and more white pepper and restrained clove.  The mild spiciness melds nicely with the spritzy carbonation, creating a flavorful level of refreshment.  Some semi-tart, dry wheat characters linger a moment after the flurry of bubbles clears, and then gives way to a finish of mild yeasty spice.  A well-deserved classic; nothing extravagent, but refined all the same.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

15,"2007-05-21",3.4,"UPDATED: JUL 11, 2008 12 oz brown bottle from Vintage Estates, thanks to Nuts. Pop the lid and you get an interesting aroma like no other.  Spicy wheaty perhaps coriander, Im not sure. Whatever it is, the aroma is volatile!  Pour is that typical wheat color, orangish with those swirling precipitants in there, very nice show.  There is some gunk on the bottom of the bottle. Very good initial flavor, I like it. The carbonation is medium high, enjoyable for a brew like this. The taste of this is good and wheaty but there are plenty of spices in there, it is not your run of the mill hefe. Comes across almost like a wit bier. There is a building medium bitterness that gathers on the back of the throat as this drink is depleted. Better than Penn Weizen. Almost as good as other cleaner Deutch hefes that I have tasted such as erdinger or Michelob barvarian wheat.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

15,"2007-05-12",3.5,"16.9oz bottle served in a weizen glass. Pours cloudy gold with an easy two fingered head.  Aroma is a nice mix of clove and banana/fruitiness. There is also a yeasty component to the aroma. This is what a hefe should smell like. Taste is sharp wheat, cloves, pepper, spice, phenolics, and earthiness. It would seem there is a tartness to the beer, maybe from the phenolics? The carbonation helps the mouthfeel, but the beer itself seems thin. A nice drinking beer and I would be overjoyed to drink it fresh with a white sausage, but I think this beer probably has its best days behind it due to the long ride from Germany. I did not like this style until I started drinking fresh, homebrew versions of it, it truly is a better beer fresh.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Aroma of banana and clove, with a bright but wheat dusted note of lemon.  Taste is brimming with yeast and wheat.  Musty wood, orange zest, mild spice highlights with a sort of sesame seed dry bite at the end.  Palate is rather thick and full but this works quite nicely, creating a sort of creamy sensation in place of the usual spritzy sharpness of weissbier.

Theres not a whole lot to say about the aroma and flavor except that this is very nearly a perfect German hefeweizen.  Theres wheat malt, banana, slight sweetness, moderate yeast, slight sourness, and everything is blended excellently.  Dry finish, *just* slightly overcarbonated.  I gather than this used to be more unique than it is now, with the proliferation of fairly similar beers, but its still an exceptional example of the style.

15,"2006-09-15",4.5,"Weihenstephaner is my favorite imported German Weissbier. 

The color is a beautiful golden orange and the foggy yeast looks bright white instead of just dirty. It also holds a decent head for a while. 

Smells like half and half, plums. bananas and wheat. Im drooling already. I noticed a lot of variation even between bottles in a six pack with this beer, which is unfortunate. This one is right on. 

Flavors creamy and smooth. Good wheat flavor, but the sweetness blended with the citrus really steals the show. Almost wholesome to the point of my mouth not recognizing it as a beer. This is making me miss my military career in Germany. 

Mouth feel is a little too carbonated for the thickness of the beer. Thats about the only miss here. 

Weihenstephaner is my go to wietzen, but I must reiterate that I found a terrible inconsistency in the freshness of this beer. If youre not impressed with the bottle in front of you, try another. This is a sad state of affairs, but the pay off of a perfect Hefe is well worth it. Good luck!","South Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","DTB"

15,"2006-09-02",4.3,"Thanks to YBSober for sharing this beer!
This is by far the best Hefe Weizen Ive ever had.

Appearance: Pours a cloudy pale orange yellow color with a big bubbly head. (BTW dont shake this one up (to mix the sediment) or you may explode the beer all over a friends kitchen. (sorry Wayne ;)

Smell: Boy, from the time this beer exploded all over the wall =) it had a fantastic aroma of lemon and wheat with a hint of fresh baked sweet bread. 

Taste: The front of the palate is full of wheat, yeasty lemon citrus, and a nice mildly sweet breadiness. There is a nice gentle bitter that balances this beer perfectly.

Mouthfeel: Oh so smooth, a bit of a nice dry finish.

Drinkability: The most drinkable wheat I have had yet. It is truly German and I highly recommend!

Hope this is helpful.

The aroma was the most powerful of the four with deep spiced notes of cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, banana, and a bit of dry yeast. Very aromatic. The flavor is a notch down from the complex, rich aroma, but it still has admirable nuances. Good balance of cloves, bananas, tangy yeast, and wheat.

15,"2006-07-23",3.2,"23-Jul-06 (500 ml bottle, Bottling code of 7106 (97-Ot-06?): BevMo in La Jolla, CA) Part of the $15 Weihenstephaner gift pack (5 beers & 1 glass), Im serving this in the authentic Weihenstephan Weizen glass that is part of the set, and I must say, it makes a huge difference to serve it in this glass versus a clumsy, heavy American pint glass.  This is quite simply a gorgeous beer when served in the proper vessel.  Cloudy, golden body fills this foot-tall glass and is capped by a tall, white, stiff, meringue-like head that takes ages to settle down to where I can actually sip actual beer, not head.  Small carbonation bubbles creep slowly up the side of the glass until the glass flares out, and then the bubbles pick up some momentum.  Lots of patchy lacing is left on the glass.  Banana, clove and pepper form the spice triumverate in the nose, with wheat contributing a nice base.  Similar flavors, with spices and wheat being the obvious components here.  Some banana, but more clove and pepper.  Its lightly sweet and minimally bitter.  I think the beer gets a bit too bready as it warms up, which is an obvious problem with this glass -- too much surface area, so the beer warms up very quickly.  Medium-bodied and moderately carbonated, but could be cleaner if the beer didnt finish with that breadiness.  A good Hefeweizen, certainly above average for the style, but dont let it warm up.17-Dec-05 (500 ml bottle: $2.49 at BevMo in Oceanside, CA) Having just sampled the Ayinger Bräu Weisse, this one comes up a bit short in virtually all respects.  Light banana and moderate clove in the flavor along with mild wheat, but theres a distinct bitterness toward the finish that seems too prominent and distracting to me.  The nose is only mildly aromatic, with light banana and wheat being the only real aromas I pick up.  Medium-bodied with moderate to strong carbonation,  Pale golden in color and fairly cloudy, I can barely make out the few streams of carbonation bubbles rising through the beer.  On the initial pour, the off-white head rises to well over two inches, but that soon fades to a thin, filmy layer, and all subsequent pours, the head never exceeds half an inch.  And theres no lacing either.  Honestly, Im just not all that impressed with this beer.  Perhaps it sat on the BevMo shelf for too long, a possibility that is not too difficult to imagine.  Still, I dont know how the bitterness would be caused by excessive aging. (6, 3, 6, 3, 12 = 3.0)","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Banana and bubblegum/cloves aromas are muted.  Smooth!  Tongue makes up for the banana the nose was missing.  Citrus is louder in the mouth, as well.  Spicy with a lasting, complex aftertaste.  Fresh, thirst-quenching, and unlike its neighbor, Paulaner, clean.  Have to agree, this is overrated, but that doesnt take away from the enjoyment - should be one of the top Weizen in the world, a toss-up with Maisels for my favorite. [2006.03.17: 4.0]
There are bottles that come in too clean, even bland, but thats part of the charm.  I generally have a pretty high banana threshold, and so this isnt really doing it for me there, and it certainly isnt overflowing with cloves.  I do love the yeast, though, which makes smooth all-rounders, and this old classic remains one of my go-to favorites, even though others may surpass it; theres something to be said for extreme consistency in such an inherently unstable product.

Bottled version suffers a little from the long journey to Oz. Pours hazy goldish yellow with a HUGE head that retains well. Classic aroma of yeast/bread, bananas and clove which also comes through in the taste in very large measure. Full mouthfeel with medium carbonation and a yeasty/malty aftertaste that lasts for ages.

The body itself, an opaque golden straw. An initial slightly lactic nose, lead to hints of sweet malt, wheat grains and vanilla. On the palate it performed an orchestral piece, with a lot going on at once. Flavours of honey & lemons, bubblegum, citrus fruits and mild clove-like notes. Carbonation bites at the front of the tongue (minor demerit), but is balanced by the big body and foamy, long sweet and sour aftertaste. A beautiful Hefe Weiss.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Upon resampling, this one is far more character loaded than the erdinger I had on parallel. Direct cloves and banana aroma. Very clean yeast profile and great mouthfeel.

Aroma is yeast profile/ phenolic, but smoother and subdued when compared to Belgian and American efforts, this leads to a fine balance tha in my opinion lets you drink another one ore two for thirst.. The yeast profile does not over power and drive you away. Mouthfeel= initial is silky on roof of mouth followed by heavy carbonation finish. Sever in proper glass, and temps between 50 and 40 F results in a fine refreshing beer.. any warmer then the banana ester I am sure would be prevelant.

It was sold out in our normal beer-import, and we waited and waited, but it never arrived, and now its closed. But my friend (Dixen in here) took a trip to Germany and bought it. And we tasted it, it was VERY good, for this moment, it is my favourite right now... It is fresh and fruity, it was like a typical weissbier should be, and it has the traditions from the oldest brewer in the world. It is sweet and has a charming coulour.

15,"2004-06-12",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2004 It starts with a lofty head that lasts to the end. Wild aromas of sweet wheats and malty goodness cloaked in citrus, bananna and candy treats.  The flavor is amazingly balanced with light cloves, nutmeg, almonds, vanilla and esters. The color a is muddled yellow-orange that is of medium cloudiness and no unsightly ""floaties"" (i liken them to sea monkeys).  The sweetness is just noticable, as is apple and paw-paw. This is all tied together with a giddy carbonation that I havent experience in other wheats and that lends amazing spirit to the beer. There is no doubting that this is a champion beer. It is a shame that raters bias bigger beers because this is quality through and through.  I envision this beer tasting its best after a long day hiking the german country-side admiring the small, simple farms and  ancient vineyards.

The whiff out of the bottle was wonderfully spicy. Out of the glass the beer smelled more musty, grassy, and yeasty. Tasted wonderfully crisp and spicy with a creamy wheat malt backbone supported by extremely flavorful hints of clove, banana, citrus, and peach.

15,"2004-03-11",3.4,"I love the sweet, wine-like aroma and golden color.  A nice head formed unlike any I've seen in a while.  This is my first Weissbier and, even though it's not my first choice of a kind of beer, it's not bad.  I appreciate this beer as being a good beer, but not one that I would drink often.  Not quite wheaty enough for me on the initial taste. The aftertaste, on the other hand is remarkably wheaty.  I like the alcohol kick, reminds me of Juebel Dunkel in that aspect.  On all other aspects, it is not very similar.","Covington, Louisiana, USA","punkeedo"
15,"2004-03-10",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2004 The aroma was pleasant wafting thru my nostrils, the appearance is of quality - but the flavour and palate were mildly disappointing. With a rating like this has from fellow Ratebeerians, I definitely expected better. What's more, I much preferred the full-of-personality Weissbier from Oberdorfer to this one. Hey, this one just lacks something in flavour and palate - and those are the most important aspects, really, of enjoying a good beer - not packaging or appearance. The aroma is something to be considered, but not the determining factor in a beer's worthiness. 2nd rating: Upon further examination, this is a quite good Weissbier. I suppose Weissbier is somewhat of an acquired taste because when I had Hoegaarden and Franziskaner I hated the stuff. Perhaps I should re-try it and see. Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier is very good, a beautiful golden yellow colour with a full, lingering head of whiteness with a graceful lace and good mouth filling flavour. I still do not think it quite worthy of its so-high rating though and think Ayinger's Weissbier to be superior. However, Weihenstephaner *is* the world's oldest brewery...and definitely worth a shot. = )","Birmingham, Alabama, USA","DerBiermeister"

15,"2004-01-22",3.5,"Bottle. Relatively recent purchase for me--from my trip to Houston in Oct/Nov 2003.  It's afresh as I'm normally ever going to see it, but alas, this bottle just doesn't do fresh Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier justice.

The beer pours golden and sports a massive creamy white head, just as it should, but even though I swirled the bottle fairly aggressively, there's no hefe--it's glued to the bottom of the bottle.

The aroma is very yeasty, with the telltale aroma of wheat, and hints of grass and a subtle matiness.
Taste is clean, yeast-malty with a nice citrus character, but there's a somewhat phenolic finish.

Also a touch of lemon zest in the nose. The taste is superb, with again a nice breadiness, topped with fruity flavors, banana being the strongest of those, with a touch of plum or grape sweetness in the background. A touch of butterscotch adds a nice contrast to the coriander spiciness and wheat crispness on the finish. The mouthfeel is buttery yet very refreshing.

Continental hops make an appearance and lend some light but detectable flavor and bitterness. Mostly dry except for a touch of honey-like sweetness.

I found myself wanting to grab another bottle of this once I finished the first--it's very good.","Wisconsin, USA","NeonLX"

Great for the summer!","Lake in the Hills, Illinois, USA","drywallman"
15,"2003-07-03",4.2,"Poster child for the true Bavarian-style hefeweisen:  the appearance is unfiltered gold; the nose is true to the style; the taste is yeasty and develops the banana and spice attributes that one associates with a good hefe, but it does not overwhelm the senses.  Very smooth finish.  Most enjoyable.","Hanover, Maryland, USA","guzzler67"

This was an enjoyable brew to drink on a warm summer day.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
15,"2003-06-25",3.3,"This brew pours a very large head of finely sized bubbles and a cloudy light yellow brown body.  It has a nice wheat beer aroma not stoo strong though.  Its flavor starts off with mild fruity banana lemon and yeast notes then mellows into a lingering soft mouthfeel.  It is on the thick side which adds to the smooth mouthfeel.

15,"2003-06-24",4.2,"Solid looking hefe, super cloudy, hazy, yeast filled golden straw color. One super large fluffy off-white head nearly three inches tall, fades and pops slowly to leave a fine thin head with some stringy sticking lace. Smell is a nice light and airy, fluffy lemon with a nice grainy wheat bread background and notes of banana and spice. Taste is one refreshing, rock solid hefe, with a perfect balance of lemon, not to tart, good breadish tone, wheaty, yeasty, but all very mellowing and smooth. Notes of banana linger and some spice of cloves. Feel is pretty full from sip to swallow, very mellow, has a textured feel in the middle, moderate tartness and a very clean finish. Which makes it incredibly drinkable, no doubt about it.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Beautiful, cloudy, orange-amber body and a huge, white, foamy head. Nice yeasty-banana, citrus nose.

Delectable hints of bitterness in the finish. Lovingly German","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"

Banana, clove, wheat, malt, lemongrass, and ripe pear come through on the nose and palate. Dry, yeast finish that you can taste 10 minutes after the last swallow. Adding a lemon to this creates a totally different beer (which I will do sometimes), but straight up, one of finest Hefe Weiss on the market.

It formed a hugh foamy white heat that left thick cobweb style of lace as it floated down the glass in float style of descent. The aroma was of malt, hops, banana and cloves.

amber with a titanic off-white creamy head that is mostly lasting and has virtually no
lacing.  The fierce malty clean nose speaks of dark bread, toasted cereal, flowers, pine,
earth, cask-wood, ginger, pepper and a touch of alcohol.  The mostly balanced and
complex flavor is very malty and fruity with the hops contributing a slight bitterness on the
edges.  The finish is very sweet, but again the hops find a way to wrap around the
sweetness without coming to the forefront of the finish.  The creamy body is medium to
full  with a touch too much lively carbonation for my liking.  I do like this beer though.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"
