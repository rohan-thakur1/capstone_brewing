953,"2017-05-26",4.0,"Une bière blonde, avec une bonne effervescence, et un gros doigt de carbonatation. Au nez, levure sauvages à la HF dattaque avec un petit côté sucré et mielleux intéressant. Au goût, la levure avec une certaine influence de levures belges est bien présentes. Il y a un certain manque deffervescence en bouche, qui laisse le gout sucré des bretts prendre lascendant. Cest toutefois bien équilibré, avec le côté belge assez présent, les levures sauvages, et un aspect sucré. Une fois la bière un peu plus réchauffée, on trouve des notes de mangues bien fruitées. Néanmoins, de passer de la Edward à ça mimpressionne parce que ce sont des bières complètement différente, mais efficace.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","LouisP"
953,"2017-05-02",4.0,"750mL bottle. Pours amberish gold with a medium off-white head. Aroma is funk, citrus, grass, white grapes, earth, hay, and oak. Taste is barnyard, funk, earth, grapefruit, lemon, grass, apricot, some tangerine, and a little oakiness. Some pepper in the finish. Some light acidic tartness with a little lingering bitterness. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Crisp-ish mouthfeel; yeast sediment makes it a bit slicker.  As it warms the fruit brightens and the barnyard diminishes, simplifying the taste to big apricot and tangerine up front with an earthy finish. The beer feels like a combination of Edward and Dorothy (especially in the aroma), although the palate isnt quite as strong as either of those beers.","Massachusetts, USA","tapefuzz"
953,"2017-02-24",4.1,"750ml 2014 bottling of E. Hasnt dried out as much as expected after all this time, and the funk level is moderate. Not a brett bomb by any means. Hop punch from release is obviously gone, now has a more rounded earthy orange character with some stonefruit and Belgian yeast spice in the finish. Also some touches of light sweet bready grain and honey notes. The fading of the hops revealed much more of a Belgian charactee than expected. Pretty balanced out right now in the profile. I preferred the somewhat dreggy pours from the second half of the bottle. Very enjoyable, but this is definitey one to drink now if youve still got it.","Hampton Roads, Virginia, USA","JBPortland"

953,"2016-04-04",4.0,"Bottle at home. Its amazing how Hill Farmsteads sour/funky beer has such a distinct aroma and taste, and E. has tons of that signature smell. Its funky and vinous, with green apple and lemon flavors and some barnyard taste.

953,"2016-03-25",4.2,"Bottled 1/26/16, drunk 3/18/16.Fantastic pour per usual. Light haze, large white head, great retention. Sparkling golden-brass body.Just a captivating nose on it. Not due to sheer force, but just so much complexity here. Theres light citrus, soft funk, earth, even light sulfur suggestions, wood, biscuit, honey, band-aid, plaster, well-water....the list goes on. Every sniff I find something new, but Id say the lemon and band-aid-like brett notes, as well as the juicy, pineapple-guava-laden hops are the largest pleasures here.Equally fun in the flavor, its nicely dry, but with a malty texture and tons of tropical fruit, band-aid, phenolic compounds (black and white pepper) and juicy hops on the end.  Some definite wood character, and a touch of toastiness, but nothing excessive.  Tight carbonation and no flaw or alcohol, the only downside is a fair bit of astringency, unable to tell whether its yeast or barrel-derived, which builds up on the finish and dulls some of the brightness/levity of the beer. Just like the bottle of The Wind I had before this, it may be my fault, having not given the bottle enough time to rest and the sediment to settle back down. I have another bottle and will be certainly updating the rating if that is the case. As is, however, this is still a supremely enjoyable, complex, drinkable beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Un liquide brillant, orangé et pourvu dune épaisse mousse blanche tenace qui cependant glisse sur mon verre. Nous avons tous été sidérés par des arômes où les fruits côtoient la barrique dans une transcendante harmonie! Les fruits tropicaux tels la mangue, la papaye et le fruit de la passion explosent littéralement pour laisser place à une barrique réfléchie ainsi quà un funk vivant qui sy est lentement développé. Un nez absolument magnifique! Je suis dérouté lorsque je glisse mon verre entre mes lèvres. Je vis complètement autre chose. Le liquide me paraît très vineux et dense, à un point tel quil me paraît presque visqueux. Une fois lattaque vinicole passée, les houblons prennent une place de plus ne plus importante et terminent leur lente ascension en me laissant en bouche une âcreté capiteuse et pâteuse.

The fruit flavors were also mellowed in the drink but luckily it still had some juicy tartness. Bone dry. I think the bitter does eclipse the fruitiness and the pepper in the finish. As it drank the bitter became unconscionable. The mouthfeel of the beer was uncomfortably dry and powdery. It had a dominant floral rather than a fruitiness.

Thanks to czar for bringing this one. Wow what an amazing aroma! This one reeks of citrus and hops with some medecinal notes here and there (and in a good way I mean, sorry if that is not clear).

Aroma is very Brett forward with some pineapple and tropical fruit. Quite a bit of overripe pear with some phenolic character and a hint of graininess. Light hop aroma is surprisingly still present.
Pours a cloudy yellow gold with a big, pillowy, white head that recedes slowly leaving quite a bit of lacing.
Flavor has quite a bit of Brett character as well was a lot of pear esters and spicy phenolics. Phenolic character isnt quite plastic but getting somewhat close to it. Slight astringency in the finish from the strong phenolic character. Light hop character still present with hints of the galaxy hops. Very dry finish with phenolics, graininess and hops. Light acidity.
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with high carbonation. Very dry. Medium low astringency and low alcohol warmth.

953,"2012-10-10",4.0,"Fully hazed, brilliant yellow-orange pour gathers a rocky, lathery head.  A quick whiff of funk quickly gives way to the brightest golden kiwi and pineapple aroma I can remember.  A blanketing of tough to find herbs and spices comes next; tarragon, clove, white pepper and dandelion.  Citrus and stone fruit notes flash like meteors.  This is a connection of quieted hops and brilliant yeasts that just thrills the imagination with its soft layering of herbal notes and pungent, rather indescribable moments of rustic funk.

The flavor is enormous but reserved like a young Orval.  First is a white pepper dusted apricot flavor, distinct and quiet.  Very light resiny hop oils surrounding it, and some dry green herbs.  Myriad stone fruits.  Gorgeous lavender.  Banana.  Gravelly and brittle.  The yeast doesnt flex much yet, and so what we have is a lovely, quiet showing of hops gathered up in the dimly seen funk of the brett.  Its like a fresh farm with no animals.

Texture is light and young; punchy with light acids and hops.  Gruyere rind and pineapple finish, leaving an oily, rubbery texture grabbing every corner of my mouth.  This is delicious, and it doesnt have it together yet.  Theres so much hop, so much saison yeast, and when the funk arrives it will just fucking kill it.  And right now, it still kind of does.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

A - Pours slightly hazed golden yellow with a nice one finger tall white head leaving spotty trails of lace down most of the glass.

S - Smells of damp earth, musty funk, spicy belgian yeast, and a nice strong fruit aroma - mainly apples and oranges. The hops are there but the other aromas drown them out a bit.

T - Starts off with the musty funk and wet earth from the aroma combining with the bready yeast and light spice to form the saison base. The fruit and hops come through toward the end of each sip, leaving the palate dried after each sip.

M - Light, smooth body with moderate carbonation. Nice crisp feel with a dry finish.

A - Deep orange & golden glow with a slight level of clouds / haziness. Head was a bit thick since I poured sort of vigorously. Had a 3 finger head that subsided semi-fast to about 1 finger after 3 minutes. Lacing was nice with lots of tight bubbles in an off-white colour.

T - Wow. Pretty remarkable. Um, very nice grassy and earthy taste, minor up-front tartness with a smooth mellow bitter hop taste on the finish. Reminds me a lot of chewing on straw or tobacco leaves.

953,"2011-12-21",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 2, 2012 750ml bottle, 1st bottled batch, courtesy 4.4-40.  The pour yields a hazy, dark, glowing orange amber body with a tall, frothy, creamy-beige head.  Slowly, the foam fades to a small, lumpy layer, leaving wet, splotchy spots of lace on the glass.  The aroma is based in fresh, pale, lightly caramelized cereal grains, sweet cracker, and bread.  Overlying hops suggest of pithy, peppery orange peel, moderately catty at points and fairly dry throughout.  A prominent, fruity, somewhat creamy yeast profile rounds things out, drawing everything together nicely.  Flavors show more of the biting, pithy hops, loaded with orange peel and suggesting of secondary dry grasses.  Yeast is delectably fruity, toughing on citrus but also some distant tropical fruit.  Malts are again crackery and softly sweet, yet dry, reminding me of Cuban Crackers in some ways.  In the mouth, the body feels mostly dry, with fine, moderately paced carbonation and a zippy, peppery finish.  Another damn fine brew from Shaun Hill.  Good stuff.750ml bottle, 2nd bottled batch.  This one was quite a bit different than batch 1.  First off, it gushed - nay, oozed a like a slow-smoldering, frothy volcano. Brettanomyces is instantly present, and in fact, quite dominant. Dusty hay and farmhouse air are prominent.  Dried pineapple plays a huge role.  Bold hop notes show more tropical notes, though pithy lemon is still present.  Yeast is intensely fruity and dusty...wild yet masterfully tamed.  Damn fine Belgian style brett pale.  Nods to Bam Biere, Orval, and other classics...but stands out on its own.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

953,"2011-10-14",4.8,"In short: An Ovalesque funky hoppy beer.  Fantastic.
How: Bottle 750ml.  A few times.  This rating for a bottle consumed 1.5 month after the beer release
The look: Cloudy orange-blonde body
In long: Nose is bretty-hoppy with strong notes of leathery funk, grapefruits, dry wild flowers.  Taste is more or less the same, a nice bed or crunchy dry cereals, a lot of funk, leather, lots of bitter grapefruits, dry flowers.  Very lively Belgian style mouthfeel and carbonation.  The beer has morphed over the few months since its release, the funk is really coming out strong and the beer is now bone dry.  Both the hops and funk are converging towards grapefruis and leather.  Comparison to Orval is unavoidable and for good reason.  When listing the individual flavor elements one by one it reads like two different beers yet somehow when I look at the big picture I cannot help but to think American Orval.  This is a fantastic beer.

This beer pops to life with a whisper and a hiss, pouring a beautifully deepy, hazy glowing orange with an initially massive, resistant, craggy tan head which recedes, leaving a seafoam crested surface. The lacing simply slides slowly down the shimmery sides of the snifter, ensnaring my scrupulous gaze. Oh, the nose. The bouqet of lovely, freshly picked delights which greets my nostrils like the sweetest summer breeze off the salty sea; strong must and sea air swirl through, leaving traces of freshly picked, plump, red delcious strawberries, gentle Brettanomyces yeast, slightly chewed Bazooka bubble gum, lemongrass, huge bailed and bundled dry hay, and truely special sourdough bread accents in its wake. As the beer washes over the tongue, it presents an inital tart, borderling sour, astringency, which, amazingly dissipates and evaportes from the tongue. The flavors left upon the palate are outrageous and the body a near perfection to behold; soft bubblegum, candied green apples, and spicy lemon zest swirl in a magnificently sturdy, yet roomy and fucking unclearly suave. This beer has no buisness being this good; it borders on the absurd. It is an area of human transcendence which, though some may dispute its very existence, is utterly invincible once experienced, truly. Today, drinking this scant, masterfully playful Belgian ale, brewed by some of the most inspired, rebellious, yet deeply respectful tradionalist brewers in the world, I am reminded of the permanancy of memory and the echo of existence. I may die, and this beer shall, too, pass--soon, Im afraid--but this moment; ah, this moment. It shall not perish from this realm so long as the stars fill the sky and until the known Universe collapse in itself. Amen, Halelujah, Omnipadi, Shanti Shanti Shanti. Cheers. Goodnight, angels of the human race. Be well, and take care of yourselves all.

Sweet passionfruit, fresh orange juice, pineapple (brett), and a [mineral, earthy] bitterness. 

A single, fragrant flower grows at the node of each passionfruit: fresh-cut flowers - grassy and floral - grow out of the tropical and stone fruitiness mid-palate. Theres a pithy bitterness throughout the palate that is most noticeable on the finish, but it blends seamlessly into the other elements of the beer, and the fruitiness becomes more and more expressive the further I get into the bottle.

953,"2011-04-17",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2017 My Bottom Line:
Pineapple, citrus fruit, brettanomyces and hop resins coalesce in this intense Wild Pale Ale, while horse stable undercurrents add to the impression of otherworldliness. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A clinging head of foam decorates the hazy dark blond.
-The fluffy mouthfeel created by the dryness and high volumes of carbonation increases the perception of funkiness in the finish.
-This finish was also resolutely bitter and resinous.
-All in all, this is yet another amazingly complex Belgian-style creature from Shaun. One which might cater to those looking for more intensity than that offered by Art or Flora, for example.
-This might very well be Orvals American cousin. Breathtaking, especially after the increase of drinkability a couple of months after its release.
