3272,"2017-05-01",5.0,"En dégustant des bières comme cette Rulles triple, on comprend pour quoi les bières belges sont inscrites au patrimoine mondial de lUNESCO, tant la maîtrise du brassage est poussée à un haut niveau avec un travail remarquable à la fois sur le malt et sur le houblon. Cette Rulles est une réelle référence du style avec un équilibre et une homogénéité simplement parfaits, à la fois ronde et puissante autour darômes fruités, fleuris et épicés. En verre, cette triple se veut dun blond légèrement voilé (EBC de 13), parée de très fines bulles et dune mousse blanche, crémeuse de 5 mm. Le nez est une splendeur, sur les céréales, les agrumes, les fruits exotiques et la coriandre, à la fois frais et profond, complexe et accessible. La dégustation ne le fera en aucun cas mentir, avec une attaque souple, orientée sur lamertume, des arômes de céréales de miel et relevées par de la coriandre et dune petite pointe dacidité très à propos. La deuxième bouche, toujours avec une prépondérance de lamertume est davantage fruité et floral. Cependant, larrière bouche, sur un équilibre splendide et plus orienté sur le malt propose des notes épicées avec notamment la girofle permettant de donner de la profondeur à la bière. La troisième bouche présente alors une amertume fine et précise avant un final, long, qui souvre et qui gagne en ampleur et en richesse sur des arômes pleins de céréales, dagrumes et dépices (notes plus poivrées). Tout est juste dans cette triple, lalcool à 8,4 % qui la structure superbement, le sucre, sans faute, léquilibre malt/houblon....Nous sommes tous riche de ce patrimoine, merci à la Belgique","FRANCE","jybi"

3272,"2015-06-05",3.5,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2016 Rating from old notes, tasted this at a Zythos Bierfestival (in Sint-Niklaas, I think 2005) but apparently overlooked it when entering my old ratings here. Peach blonde beer with yellowish white, moussy head and yeasty as well as lightly spicy hoppy aroma, bit phenolic, bit estery; fruity taste, yeasty but not too dull, light citrussy freshness, sweetish malts with a caramelly touch, full mouthfeel, herbal and lightly spicy but otherwise rather subdued hop bitterness in the finish. Certainly not unpleasant, in fact a rather interesting one in this somewhat tedious Belgian style, but Id have to taste this anew, as I assume it has inevitably changed in ten years time.

Taste is decent tripel, where again hop malts and yeast are so balanced. Mild bitterness, toasted grainy aftertaste and a nice yeasty aftertaste (orval yeast i think). Hops are typical for the Ardenne brews, very floral and grassy.

Ruohoakin saattaa olla hieman joukossa. Maussa on alussa marjaisuus hyvin vahvana ennen kuin mausteinen belgihiivaisuus tulee joukkoon mukaan. Hiven tummempaa hedelmää on mukana, muttei samalla tavalla kuin hajussa. Suutuntuma on keskitäyteläinen, hieman hiilihappoinen ja kuivemman puoleinen.

(et encore, dans ce cas-ci, et par la plus grande exception, je partage la pratique du 
brasseur si elle a permis de maintenir toutes les qualités de cette bière extraordinaire).
Pour le reste, nous sommes en présence dune merveille pure.
Mon exemplaire est un 75 cl de 20 mois dâge (alors que le brasseur préconise une
date-limite à 18 mois dâge).
Couleur doré brillant magnifique, voire parfait (pour une triple bien entendu).
Clarté pure, cristalline.
Bulles fines à moyennes par milliers.
Mousse blanc un peu cassé, bien crémeuse au centre et qui tient facilement à 1 cm.
Arômes de blé, épices, houblon aromatique et amer, herbes fines.
1ère bouche à la texture soyeuse, extrêmement fine, qui constitue un magnifique ensemble
dune fraîcheur magique : blé, levure, houblon, avec une pointe de coriandre et de girofle
très fine.
2ème bouche dune texture incroyable comme du sable micrométrique, dune finesse parfaite,
et dune granulométrie inimaginable.
3ème bouche dun équilibre prodigieux avec des houblons extraordinaires.
Arrière-bouche avec une pointe dépice particulière, du type dun poivre gris ultrafin.
La longueur procure encore dautres nuances splendides, toujours fraîches et fines.
Ces nuances sont quasi miraculeuses parce quelles touchent à tous les registres dune 
triple.... Fraîcheur, amertume, céréales, houblon, levure. Splendide.
Levure fine, complexe, parfaite pour le sujet de la triple.
Alcool parfait, 8,4 % abv qui travaillent 84 fois les saveurs. Magique.
Finale strictement prodigieuse : un feu dartifices de saveurs pour compléter les impressions
précédentes perçues dans la longueur.
Conclusion : une merveille des merveilles, un sommet de lart brassicole. Cette petite brasserie
de la Gaume belge égale ainsi des bières de grand renom, et de classe mondiale.

The carbonation is not strong but tingling and adds well to the refreshing overall feeling.

{elements}Hazy, dark peach hue; tight, creamy, white head. Primary aroma of crackers, honey and sesame with a tease of lemon zest and white grapes; interestingly smoky, almost fudgy, character likely yeast derived; softly herbal, forceful floral character. Gentle sweetness with well balanced acidity and bitterness; the latter is forceful enough, though never so much as to distract from the yeast and malts. Bright, scrubbing carbonation, medium body, creamy texture. Alcohol is detectable, but neither harsh nor intrusive, and yet the beer drinks like one half its size. 75 cl bottle, best before February 2012.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

Fruity aroma with honey, plums, apples and a touch of citrus and brown sugar. Glowing, medium amber color with a bit more than lace. Very unexplosive.

Lovely mellow flavor, lots of lemon zest, some peach, gently sweet, honey malts, not intensely spicy, just laid back and really enjoyable to drink.

3272,"2008-10-03",3.9,"This one exploded.  The yeast just misted through the whole bottle, and the pour is a dirty blonde with a still suspension of particles obscuring it.  Dandelion and sourish adhesive aroma.  Coriander.  Brown spices, surprisingly pungent and damp; cardamom, mace, and maybe turmeric.  Salt, and some brown sugar.  Lots of variables, some of them pretty unique.  It has some appealing dirtiness and farm-like textures that spin it in a Fantome vein every so often.
 
Bitter and dry pithy citrus and green spice flavors.  A certain golden dry graininess seems more in line with sunflower seeds and the earthiest of wildflower honeys than it does with the sweetened dough and candi sugar crunch of a prototypical example.  The haze of mystery is heavy.  Vinous textures are deep, surprisingly, as the dryness here at times seems quite tannic and wooden.  The flavors of hazelnuts, almonds, and pistachios really do a fantastic job of making the dryness of the beer soft and earthy, and bitter enough to sidestep the sugary, syrupy flavors that are a bit disdainful to me; likewise, there’s a delicate floral quality and enough sourish funk to make it interesting beyond its already complicated exteriors.

Wildflower honey texture.  Soft and bright.  Gentle carbonation and a medium-full palate.  The departures here take positive directions, and it’s overall very pleasant; a fine effort from a fine brewery.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Secondary notes of creamed peaches, plasticy phenols, pistachios, and candy sugar. Snug, fluffy carbonation. Creamy yeast foundation and a medley of vibrant tropical-fruit esters softly embrace the zippy and succulent floral hops. Fluffiness of the malt is beautifully mirrored by its crisp crackery definition which underscores the immaculate attenuation. Zingy notes of cantaloupe, mango, and Juicy Fruit gum are illuminated by the brisk, crackly phenols. Peppery yeast lends lots of character. Hops generate a dab of resins which coat the palate but do not detract from the lustrous array of subtleties. Though not to detrimental levels, a distant note of aspirin rigidly exudes. Bitterness is otherwise  squeaky clean due to the delightfully pillowy yeastiness which gently softens its blow. Alcohol is brilliantly concealed throughout. Herbal- and lime-tinged bitterness gracefully penetrates the soft malt and yeast toward the finish. Closes dryish and elegantly with a blend of pear, green raisins, zesty hops, and creamy yeast. A rather rustic and earthy Triple which is largely defined by its characterful strain (Orval) of yeast. Just short of extravagant.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Poured into a tall logo Hefe looking glass, the beer appeared a cloudy golden orange with a tall whipped white head. In the aroma and flavor, the yeast bade a bold statement;  it was quite fruity with big phenol esters, doughy with life-size spicy clove, black pepper, red apple and banana. The palate was oily and slick.  I really did enjoy this beer, twice; and it was oddly the best beer that Delirium Café had on its draft lineup?","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

Something wild about the beer, not funky but still wilder than most Saisons.  Very little hops presence.  No alcohol at all, drinks itself like a 5% witbier.  Parts of it remind me of their Estivalle on steroids without the hops of the Estivalle.  This is not an intense beer, it is a very smooth, subtle and extremely pleasant beer.

The aroma is quite different than expected with lots of spicy notes of coriander, anise, and herbs. Some fruity, barnyard, and phenolic esters as well. The taste is equally strange and not what I would expect in a tripel. Sure there is a sweet malt and candi sugar base, but there is also a moderate acidic and flowery nature than seems not to fit the style. I get some phenols on the palate as well. The finish sort of peters out and only leaves some lingering pepper and just a touch of orange rind to remind you of what you just finished. That said, I do enjoy the flavor of this offering as a whole. The feel is fizzy and lively but not really refreshing either, once again not very Tripel like. There are some alcohol notes as well well into the bottle tasting. It is more Biere de Garde or even a winter Saison than Tripel in my opinion.

3272,"2005-04-17",3.3,"So, when I got this bottle out of the fiidge I gave it a couple turnes upside down to get the yeast off the bottom.  Big mistake, even after an hour and half before I opened it, it foamed up like a volcano.  Amazingly after I poured out some of it, it calmed down, didnt even give me much head in the glass.  However, it looks mighty pretty not; golden orange color with some speckles floating throughout.  Aroma is a slightly skunky sweet malt scent, with some light fruit notes of citrus and orange.  Flavor is a smooth malt and fruity sweetness that is very drinkable.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","MAP"
3272,"2005-04-09",3.5,"Big bottle while sitting outside at N3rd for the first time this season.  Cloudy orange brew, no head, lots of fizz.  Aroma and upfront flavors of orange and vanilla?  Dont detect any added spice - it all comes from the yeast.  Very reminiscent of a well-made homebrew:  a bit sweet  kind of like the yeast ran out of gas and didnt ferment all the way - residual malt and candi sugar.","Northern Liberties, Pennsylvania, USA","pobenohne"

Nice perfumey aroma with herbs, flower petals, and plenty of spice, combining for a sort of potpourri-in-a-bottle effect.  The flavor wasnt quite as compelling, with sweet honey, rotting fruit and white grape juice balanced by spices (pepper), flower petals, and a touch of honey.  Yeasty with a crackery finish.

3272,"2004-12-10",4.1,"750 ml. green champagne bottle. No freshness date seen. Capped, but not corked. Poured out a hazy, light orange / caramel color. It had a huge frothy, white, meringue like head that held on for dear life. It left a more than generous lacing down the sides of my Chimay chalice. (What else do you serve a Belgian in?) Aromas are of orange creme candies, hint of citrus, fresh cut Timothy grass, slight fruitiness as well.
No typical Belgian funk, and that is a welcome relief. Tastes are of citrus, malts, some vanilla and caramels, definite melon flavors as well. No pepper, no banana, and no cloves make this the cleanest tasting triple Ive had so far. Carbonation level is high, but correct for the style. Not much in the hops dept. Subdued hop aromas & flavors. Thick, rich mouthfeel. Creamy & smooth in texture. Finishes very well balanced. A top notch triple.","","Cobra"
