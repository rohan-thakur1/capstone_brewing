1816,"2017-06-21",4.1,"33cl bottle. Very dark clear brown pour with a thin tan head that dissipates quite quickly. Smooth coffee and vanilla up-front, the good stuff, Founders Breakfast Stout-like, with dark chocolate, dried fruit, a bit of salt and light smoked malts following. A beer that is very much to my liking, though lacking a bit in body and texture and perhaps intensity. Well done!","The Hague, NETHERLANDS","mariuspoenari"

1816,"2017-06-01",4.0,"Data ważności:  08.11.2019 
 Warka numer: 094 
 Dodatki:  Kawa z Kenii, Bourbon wanilia i wędzone słody 
 Kolor:  Ciemnobrunatny. Słaba przejrzystość. 
 Piana:  Okazała, wysoka, czapowata.
Cała plejada beżowych oczek przylegających do siebie.
Utrzymuje się długo. Opada powoli. Nie pozostawia wielu śladów na szkle. 
 Zapach:  Bardzo fajny i konkretny aromat.
Na samym przodzie mamy intensywną kenijską kawę, odrobinę palonych słodów, gorzką czekoladę i karmel.
Nieco z boku troszeczkę słodyczy od wanilii.
Aromat wędzonki bardzo ugładzony, raczej w klimacie dymu z nad ogniska. 
 Smak:  Tutaj zdecydowanie wanilia wychodzi przed szereg. Nie jest to taka beczkowa wanilia, raczej jakieś płatki dębowe, czy cukier waniliowy.
Na języku czuć bardzo intensywną kawę. Jest to z całą pewnością coś w rodzaju cappuccino, lub Cafe Latte - słodkie, kremowe. Jest też karmel i mleczna czekolada. W oddali delikatna wędzonka drzewna.
Tekstura trunku jest gęsta, ale nie oleista.
Alkohol w pełni ułożony.
Wysoka pijalnosc i średnia goryczka. 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie do średniego. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Z całą pewnością najlepsze piwo z Sori Brewing. Ten estoński browar ma na swoim koncie parę ciekawych wypustów. 
Dodatek kawy z Kenii i Bourbonowej wanilii sprawił, 
że piwo stało się smaczne i dobrze przyswajalne. 
Nie jest to żaden sztos, ale porządnie uwarzony trunek, który dla Estończyków powinien być także dobrem narodowym, w końcu to także kraj nadbałtycki z którego wywodzi się Baltic Porter.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"
1816,"2017-05-26",3.9,"Loads of vanilla, a healthy dose of cocoa and chocolate make great aroma, a tiny bit of smokiness in the background. Taste is sweet, again with good amount of vanilla, pleasing chocolaty aftertaste. A bit of smoke yet again which doesnt really fit in my opinion, but it doesnt ruin it.

Very smooth in taste with quite a lot of chocolaty sweetness with some very delicate roasty bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is slightly warming but is in general very well hidden. This stuff is extremly good drinkable and goes down like a vanilla-chocolate shake.","Poznań, POLAND","matbli"

1816,"2017-04-06",4.2,"Aroma:

Medium aroma of malts, caramel, vanilla, chocolate, mocha, roasted malts and coffee.

Appearance:

Opaque dark brown/black beer with medium yeast and with a slight beige/brown head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium/heavy sweet with malts, caramel, vanilla, chocolate and mocha; ends slightly bitter and dry with roasted malts and coffee.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. That added vanilla and coffee create an amazing flavour together with the malt bill. Do not really get that smokiness to be honest. Perfect appearance and a great palate as well, but the aroma could have been stronger.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

1816,"2017-03-24",4.1,"Pours dark brown with huge frothy beige head. The aroma is very sweet: milk chocolate, cappuccino, vanilla beans, some nuttiness. The flavour is huge chocolate, vanilla, residual sugars, toasted nuts, lactose. As it warms the coffee is more predominant and balances very well the sugary part. Its chewy, medium to full body, velvety (almost oily) texture, really soft carbonation. Very surprised by this one. Awesome!","Barcellona P.G., ITALY","Faathoven"

Tastes excessively sweet of chocolate and vanilla, with powdery dryness in the finish. Smooth on the palate, carbonation kept to near minimum. Considerable booziness as its warmed. Im not psyched - this is rather typical of Sori to mix all sorts of good things together and hope itll work. Sometimes it kinda does but more often you can tell its a sweet mess.
