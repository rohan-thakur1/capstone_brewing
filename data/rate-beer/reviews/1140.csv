1140,"2017-04-17",4.1,"My Bottom Line:
Juicy grapes take on violet and sour cherry impressions, as yeasty wilderness is sealed with refreshing tartness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A pinkish head of foam tops the fantastically rich purplish red gown.
-There is some basement mustiness under the juiciness (this is Cantillon, after all), but it doesnt take center stage.
-Mouthfeel is frothy and lean.
-The fruit character is beautifully developed in this one.

1140,"2017-04-17",4.0,"Bottle shared by Simon, thanks! Deep red pour with pink white head. Aroma is winey, spicy red wine notes, light oak, mild citric notes, very winey. Taste is fruity, fairly mild for a cantillon, tart, bright fruity acidity. Palate is light bodied, drying, med carbonation. Good stuff.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
1140,"2017-04-16",4.1,"Bottle (750 m) at tasting. Massive thanks to Simon for sharing! Bright and deep red with a persistent dark pink head and little lacing. Aroma is among the most red wine forward I had in a beer so far with red fruits aplenty, mild oaky notes and light mineral notes. Taste is tannic and red wine forward, red fruits, mineral notes, oak and mild herbalness. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Tannic mouthfeel. Red fruits finish. This is one of the most beautiful beer I have seen color wise and also the most similar to a red wine. Rather soft profile but really well balanced and enjoyable.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

1140,"2016-05-23",3.7,"Dense and dark deep red. The fruit is very dominant but it is a nice beer. Id like to see where this is 6-12 months from now when the fruit fades a bit and the lambic moves forward.","New Jersey, USA","GrumpyOldTroll"

1140,"2016-05-10",4.4,"Pours dark red with almost lilac hints, very saturated in color, while producing a small, foamy, bubbly head.

Funky, musty, leather and a faint vinous grape addition define the nose, with an unusual heaviness of the aromas alluding to the beers fuller body, in reminiscence of a full bodied red wine.

Has a pungent acidity, perfectly enhanced by the dry finish of the grapes among soothing, earthen wood, which ensures an intense but smooth mouthfeel. Its sourness lingers on the back end of the palate for ages, transforming to an even further fermented stage.

Dry, overripe fruits from the beginning establish a sour fruity interplay, which lasts till the finish, with the beers pungent sourness prevailing. Acidity level is high, mingling into a dryness of heavily fermented grapes, which turn almost more bitter than sour after the swallow. The beer, despite its pungent intensity, remains smooth on the tongue, with a faint minerality adding to dry grape piths, wrapped up by old wood and blue cheese.

This, to me, is closer to being a wine than a beer. It is beautifully though, creating a nice blend between rich, dry grapes and the sour, funky base of the beer. Its aftertaste sticks to the tongue for ages, while producing a flowery fruit peak, which compliments the other flavours very well.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Deep blackberry aromas but at the same time some unripe wine aromas. The red wine aromas is confirmed by taste exept for the tannins. Lovely structure.

1140,"2016-05-05",4.3,"Bottle sample @ Quintessence 2016.
Pourpre présentant un léger trouble, col est minime virant sur une légère collerette rosâtre. 
Arôme est profond au niveau du vin et restitue des effluves généreuses qui sapparentent à la version Pinot dAunis. Le bouquet reste dans la lignée de lambics Cantillon, retrouve un boisé fin de chêne sec, un fruité qui est complexe et passe du raisin aux baies rouges.
Palais offre des notes de vin avec un fruité superbement bien restitué et le tout propulse chaque gorgée entre un voyage mariant vin/bière. Retrouve tjrs le léger côté funk et sec de lambic avec une fine note de citronné qui est vite éclipsée au profil dun apport volumineux du vin-du moins du raisin.

Même cépage utilisé pour la version vin de Nuit dEncre vu que la bière était aussi annoncée sous Nuits Bruxelloises? En tous les cas, Jean continue son aventure et son idée de mélanger linspiration viticole avec le monde du lambic.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

Turbidity/density were extremely high, little to no translucence. Slightly bitter grape presence, would do well with significant aging. Was advised it would put my palate to the limit, and it certainly did. Hope to see this blended with a more acidic grape varietal.","Massachusetts, USA","gn0sis"

1140,"2015-12-10",4.5,"Bottle at the source. Without doubt the most beautiful lambic I?ve seen with a golden shimmering purpleish red color and purple foam. Full of aromas from the grapes with a dry grape skin feel and aromas of dark berries, slight grape pepperiness and lambic.

1140,"2015-12-06",4.4,"Sample at Vini Birre Ribelli Brussels. Many thanks Jean!
APPEARANCE: very dark deep red beer, small rather unstable reddish head.
NOSE: lots of fruits, the grapes used are clearly full of potential! Sourness is only faintly noticeable because of the explosive fruitiness.
TASTE: sourness comes in knocking here, not too much, fruits as very overwhelming again. This beer is amazing as is atm, but will probably age amazingly! Lots of potential and amazing experiment!","Gent, BELGIUM","PriorL"

1140,"2015-11-29",4.9,"#40 Cantillon. Sampled (3 times) 750 ml. bottle @ Vini Birre Ribelli 2015. Pours very deep wine red, brief hugely dark, deep pink head, minus the patches of head, this looks like a super deep red wine. Impressive. Nose is basically a huge fruity red, none of the grape skin, tannins & oak dryness I am used in wine or at least, very little, massively fruit, red berries, red grapes, cranberry, massively fruity character, basically no lambiek character. Taste is hugely fruity red grape, cranberry, red grapes, so much wine character, it is hard to even recognize this as beer, it has none of the qualities / dryness, I usually associate with red wine, just massive fruit, massive fruit juice, finish has some light fruit skins, touch oak, Body is hugely fruit red wine. Phenomenal beer. Basically the perfect red wine for me at this point, I am not a wine lover. I tried the red wine made with the same grapes from Zelige after this. I got some interesting explanation about it from Jean Van Roy which is too much wine talk to properly write down here but which was very interesting. The wine was less to my like, insanely dry, insane amount of bitter red grapes skins & tannins, hard to drink even, totally dried out your mouth, brutal, none of the massive fruitiness that I loved in the Cantillon beer. Jean Van Roy describe this as being to young at this point given the insane presence of fruit. I understand him, seeing how this one will evolve from this point on will be interesting. It already is spectacular. Now Jean Van Roy has gone from making beer / wine hybrid experiments to being a wine maker which is what he basically considers himself I believe. Superb beer.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
