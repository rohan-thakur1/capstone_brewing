1615,"2017-06-05",3.2,"Bottle - Aromatic rice and yeasty notes. Light and creamy with a touch of sweetness and rice. Easy drinking.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
1615,"2017-03-30",3.4,"This is one of those few sakes in which there is a clear indication in English advising us that it is a Junmai Ginjo. You know how difficult it is to try to figure out from a non-export version, eh? And Im not sure why people are so hard on this one. It is indeed sweet and milk and suave. Well, smoothness is a quality. It can certainly be a welcome feature.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"
1615,"2016-09-18",3.5,"Bottle at home. Pours clear and still. Aroma is sweet rice, light vanilla and banana with soft alcohol. Flavor is sweet rice, light banana and vanilla, drying alcohol and a dry finish. Full body.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
1615,"2015-12-23",3.3,"Bottle at a Japanese restaurant in abs über were given gift card to including babysitting. Slight hazed pour. Nose is light melon and rice. Tastes of rice, papaya, melon, grainy. Not cleanest palate but drinkable and fine enough","New York, USA","Jow"
1615,"2014-04-19",2.6,"[ Bottle ][ Sushi Tadokoro SD ][ 500mL ][ $25 ][ Sake Cup ][ 4/18/14 ]
>> Clear pour, nothing worth noting. Nose is muted, small pineapple, flash of white alcohol, fruity strawberry. Taste begins with vodka white alcohol, clears up quickly to mild pineapple and water. Clean, refreshing finish with no alcohol presence. No aftertaste. Very much a neutral palate cleanser type of sake with little presence in of itself. Forgettable.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
1615,"2012-07-03",2.7,"This is for the Organic version, clear, colorless with a nose of a strong Pina Colada, stronger alcohol than fruit, some koji as well. Light on the palate, added alcohol evident, grainy, slight fennel and apricot pit,  warming alcohol. Not really a stand out sake, just middle of the pack.","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"
1615,"2012-03-01",2.7,"It pours a slight off greenish tint, and a hint of yellow. The aroma contains notes of: rice koji, pepper, shitake mushroom, grassy quality, and alcohol. The taste is medium sweet that finishes with light acidic; there are notes of: fuji apple, rice koji, alcohol, and earthy quality. The palate is light-medium body, slight alcohol burn and medium finish. Overall, it lacks in the flavour department.","Ontario, CANADA","chris__hartley"
1615,"2010-08-20",2.7,"This bottled sake from a bottle shop poured a head of frothy medium sized clear colored bubbles that were very quickly diminishing and left behind a uncarbonated transparent clear colored body and no lacing. The mild aroma was rice. The semi-dry smooth mildly vinous mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start mediumly tingly at the finish with a medium vinous aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of rice plastic and mildly vinous. An OK sake just nothing special.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1615,"2009-08-01",3.4,"At the Wine House Sake Tasting. Pours with a clear hue and strong legs. Aroma is fruity with melon, almonds and mandarin orange. Taste is fruity, chalky and a touch spicy as far as sakes go. Medium viscosity, decent balance.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1615,"2009-07-14",3.5,"Served cold. Poured clear. Light aroma of some apple, a bit of honey, perhaps a touch of alcohol. Flavor follows and is surprisingly sweet with notes of honey and wildflowers, some dark fruits, coconut, with perhaps a touch of alcohol coming in. Pretty smooth. Overall a nice sake, though not as subtle as the finest, and has a clean sweet flavor and goes down easily.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"
1615,"2009-06-11",3.4,"I had this as part of a Sake sampler at Japan in Epcot. Poured a clear color. Aromas of rice with some faint fruitiness . Tastes of the same...rice, fruitiness, and some coconut.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"

1615,"2008-08-28",2.6,"Bottle... Clear with no legs, but its a small sample. A touch of fennel in the nose. Thin, watery texture. Sweet, but not overly so, with no acidity or bitterness. Kinda gross, but Im not much of a sake guy.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1615,"2008-07-29",4.2,"Clear as water w/ spicey aromatics and just a hint of the chocolate bamboo. Light and dry w/ a plesant fruity charcter. Refined flavors of bamboo and hard candy necklace. The finish is polished w/ defined alcohol and lingering candy fruit.  Not a complex specimen but surely delicious.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"
1615,"2008-04-19",3.4,"Pour is clear...faint floral sweet aroma, but very faint...flavor is dry with a faint nutty character...","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"
1615,"2008-03-25",3.4,"Drank cold at Chinios in Vegas. Good flavor for me. I like Sake and this was not a burning strong flavor yet mild and a bit sweet.","Western Minneapolis Suburbs, Minnesota, USA","footbalm"
1615,"2008-02-07",2.7,"Clear white, mildly viscous. Aroma of lightly sweet rice and alcohol. Quick, sweet aftertaste. Extremely smooth compared to other sakes Ive had ... certainly the mnost drinkable.","Cullman, Alabama, USA","RichJ7"

1615,"2007-11-25",3.2,"300 ml bottle from City Market in Burlington, VT (November 2007), served chilled from a White Winter Winery glass.  Utterly clear, colorless body with a faint oiliness and very faint legs left in the glass....bright fruity aroma -- peaches, passion fruit, papaya, and a touch of buttery cookie dough....very clean and smooth on the palate, alcohol only lightly present until the dryish, somewhat hard finish; moderately sweet, lightly malty-doughy....nice enough but a bit heavy at the end and somewhat on the mineralic side as it warms which just doesnt work well with the fruitiness.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1615,"2006-04-13",3.6,"Pretty sweet flavor on the palate. A good compliment to Asian cuisine and is drinkable by itself.","USA","furuyamasan"
1615,"2006-02-07",3.7,"Clear color, thick sticky legs. Nose is light and complex with koji and musky cotton, light banana and tropical fruits, complex, but not over the top. The flavor has very low acidity with a buttery and creamy mouthfeel. The tail is non-existant and slightly warming. Interesting sake, not very pronounced, but easy to drink. Thanks to IdahoJizake for a taste of this treat.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"

1615,"2006-01-07",3.4,"Bottled. Clear water appearance. Some alcohol in the nose. Very elegant, soft flavour. Theres a underlying presence of sweetness from the rice and warmth from the alcohol. However still very balanced. A good Junmai.","Copenhagen K, DENMARK","Mads Langtved"

1615,"2005-10-07",3.0,"Harsh.  Plain and simple.  Halfway to rubbing alcohol.  I was immensely disappointed with how bad this was, especially when compared side by side with the urakasumi sake at a local Korean restaurant in NYC.  Somewhat dry and crisp.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
