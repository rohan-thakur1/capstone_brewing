2202,"2016-09-12",3.4,"12 ounce bottle from Woodmans in Rockford, IL, consumed at cellar temp or a little below from a Carlyle pint glass. Deep amber verging on chestnut, smallish lasting ring of head...light malty nose - bit of caramel, bit of dark bread, slightly toasty...body is relatively sweet and honey-caramel-ish to start, but takes on that toasty bread character pretty quickly, though the sweetness continues through to the finish...its slightly sticky but the body does support the strong malt character, and its got enough toasted/burnt/acrid character at the end to keep the sweetness from overwhelming, though the low carbonation level is slightly problematic. Overall pretty solid and Im beginning to really look forward to finding more of this brewerys offerings - and can I mention that I really love this brewerys labels (maybe I should bump up the ""appearance"" score by 1?) - they all seem to hark back to the 20s and 30s, sort of neo-futurist combined with early sci-fi pulp art. Cool stuff.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
2202,"2016-04-13",3.1,"Darker clear golden orange with a light tan head. Bready slightly, roasted malts and some light spiciness. Slight bitterness, deeper malt sweetness. Medium body, slight oiliness. Light carbonation, medium long finish. Fine.

2202,"2015-09-23",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 12, 2015 12 oz bottle, poured into a pint glass. The aroma is a bit funky and earthy with a noted maltiness and roasted nuts, some peanut butter, and bread toast. It pours a clear, rich caramel hue with a white, sudsy head that has a mild soapy retention and lace. The taste is a medium bittersweet, a bit more sweet than bitter.It?s slick with a zippy carbonation and a medium body that?s dominant flavor is caramel and nuts with a backing note of bread crust  The finish is smooth and h as a citrus zest to it that turns malty and nutty. It?s aftertaste is light and mellow with flavors of bread, nuts, earth and a note of slightly burnt molasses.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

2202,"2014-09-26",4.1,"Im really liking the clean pure taste of Metropolitans beers, and this one is no exception. Malty without being too sweet or funky. Also some nice hops in the end. Well balanced, clean, flavorful. Good.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"
2202,"2014-09-13",3.4,"This is a tasty Oktoberfest, malty but not too sweet. It is copper and clear with only a small head. Its nose is rather mild but rich caramel and nutty malt notes really jump once you taste it. This is full bodied but just a touch sweet and not to hang. It finishes with a little earthy bitterness. This is a pretty decent take on the style.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

2202,"2014-09-10",3.1,"Havent had a new (for me) Oktoberfest in quite a while. This brew pours a somewhat pale orange-ish body with a slender white head. The aroma is sweet (but no too much so) with caramel and a touch of toffee. Same with the taste, cept theres a quiet earthy bitterness to keep the beer in balance. A decent offering from Metropolitan, one of my local breweries.","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
2202,"2013-12-09",3.8,"Aroma is malts, German lager yeast and a hint of fruit/tobacco. The flavor is fruit/tobacco, malts, berries and a tangy/slightly tart finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"

2202,"2013-10-28",2.3,"Bottle, via Archer Liquors, Chicago, pours a semi-clear rusty copper color with a decent head. Nose is grainy and bready, and not all that pleasant, but its a lager. Taste is grainy with caramel and malt. Finishes poorly without flavor or taste, but not a lager lover and that has to be in my tasting equation. Pass the ales. Quaff Score 5/ 10","Coral Springs, Florida, USA","jjgmd"
2202,"2013-10-28",2.6,"Pours a clear copper orange with a beige head and aroma of malt and caramel. Taste is of malt, caramel, grains, straw with a malty, smooth finish. Light and typical Oktoberfest, not my favorite style","Coral Springs, Florida, USA","zgaier"
2202,"2013-10-15",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 18, 2016 At Rockwells. Metropolitan does a good job of making excellent right on style versions of German beers. This is another example. Soft smooth somewhat slick mouth feel and a roasted butteriness. Serving: Tap","Chicago, Illinois, USA","rubbishystuff"
2202,"2013-09-28",3.9,"12 oz. bottle. Pours a rich orangish red color with a thick off white head. Aroma of wood, rich caramel malts, with a slight floral and herbal aroma. Flavor is sweet, mild bitterness imparted by the hops. Some wood, some grass, some caramel. Certainly interesting. Full bodied, nice average carbonation. Delicious.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
2202,"2013-09-24",3.6,"Bottle. Pours a really nice, clear, deep ambery-copper color with big rocky off-white head. Stellar retention and lacing. Nose is noble hops, dried grass, orange peel, toasted malts. Mouth is medium bodied and clean, malt forward with toasted bread and caramel, some orange peel in the midrange, very mild underlying hops bitterness at the finish. Really nice example of the style and my favorite Metropolitan beer to date. Prost!","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"

Copper-gold with fair, creamy, white head / Nose of honey, toast, and caramel / Medium to full body, fat with low carbonation, creamy, somewhat sweet and resinous, with good, lightly bitter finish / Flavors of honey, violet, grain, and resinous / This is a terrific lager, say a Dortmunder, but I pick up no Marzen character.  So what.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jstraw"
2202,"2012-10-02",3.7,"Enjoyed on tap at Sheffields in Chicago, IL while eating dinner with some friends, talking about random stuff.  I didnt take tasting notes, so Im not going to get into details about specifics, but I remember this being an above-average Oktoberfest brew, and would gladly like to have this one again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"
2202,"2012-09-29",3.4,"20 oz draft on tap at Bavarian Lodge (Lisle, IL). Pours a richer orange copper hue, gentle haze with more sunset orange glowing edges. A striking glow with cakey offwhite head atop, a nice firm layer laces ok, sticks around as a nice layer. Aromas are nice toasted malt and biscuit, gentle toffee kisses, grainy bread and toast grow. A gentle carmelization, touch of spice and mellow earthy dry hopping provides a mellow yet slowly growing bitterness, florals and earth. Bit of bakery bread, crusty and a bit toasty. Initial is lighter end of the fold, grainy and bready, a touch toasty, with a bit of carmelization. Wheat bread, some gentle rye, toasty darkness, and grainy malts. Some dryness and earthy hops contribute into the middle, some dryness and gentle florals. Kiss of spice, earth and grass keep the maltiness in check to a certain point. A bit of dark fruit, marmalade make a faint appearance, some more toastiness, carmelization into the backend. Some toast, lingering malty grain, bread, and biscuity slant. A solid Okt offering, quite drinkable and balanced, hitting all elements. A bit thin into the backend, I think. But more drinkable. Mellow hopping that grows, gentle spice. Solid offering, a bit lighter for the style it seems, but a nice fresh local offering. I enjoy a few of the other Metro offerings a bit more though.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
