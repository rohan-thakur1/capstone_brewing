4354,"2017-06-22",3.5,"Bottle @ Fox and hounds, Sønderborg. Dark brown almost black with a big, creamy beige head. Relatively light aroma for this kind of beer, dark malt, light caramel, some vanilla and hint of wood. Flavor is medium sweet, dark malt, caramel, some peat and moderate bitterness. Medium body and shorter aftertaste than expected. Quite nice and probably one of the better one from Innis & Gunn and luckily no butterscotch here as this almost seems to be the signature flavor. Still a bit disappointing as the package and price indicates something of extraordinary high quality.","Kristiansand, NORWAY","Beer5000"
4354,"2017-06-10",3.5,"Bottle from hayduke that we had together via facebook chat. Quite dark and with some amber highlights. A big tan head that falls slowly. Aroma is wood with toffee and vanilla. The flavor is very close to that. Buttery toffee and vanilla outshine the wood. There is earth and gentle wood notes. Its not a complicated beer.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
4354,"2017-06-10",3.7,"This was a joint tasting with Strykzone. This one has aged some. Pours brown color with a large, very foamy, long lasting, beige head with great retention that has good lacing. Nose of sweet caramel malt, toffee, vanilla, and quite a bit of oak. The body is on the thin side and the mouthfeel is soft with lots of carbonation. Flavor has bourbon and oak, along with vanilla and fruit, Finish is chocolate and bourbon on oak. Overall quite good.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
4354,"2017-04-18",3.6,"Tonight I cracked a limited Oak-aged Innis & Gunn ale expression.

Sleeping for over 3 months in first-filled bourbon barrels, there is no surprise we have some significant cask character. 

Formerly I found I&G beers to be a one trick pony with very limited malt character and almost completely a cask finish palette. 

Not so here my friends. Instant caramel, toffee, butterscotch and rich mineral groundwater here. The cask character is a pronounced one with all the sweet vanilla and oak notes you would expect. The deep palette is complex, very satisfying, and finishes exceptionally smooth.","Alberta, CANADA","AgentAle"

4354,"2017-02-11",3.5,"500ml bottle. (2015 vintage) Pours a hazy red-brown with a large, creamy, long lasting, beige head that laces. Sweet aroma of caramel malt, toffee, oak and vanilla. Sweet flavour of caramel malt, dark fruit, orange, molasses, vanilla and oak with just a hint of bourbon in a dry, mildly bitter, herbal finish. Medium body with a creamy, smooth, oily texture and soft carbonation. Nice, one of their better beers.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","cmacklin"
4354,"2017-01-03",4.0,"Bottle. 2015 vintage. Pours a dark ruby-brown body with a very large tan head that takes a while to recede. Aroma has a nice complexity, with notes of vanilla, caramel, dried dark fruit (dates, figs), oxidized apple, oak, anise and leather. Flavour is simpler, but still very good, with nice vanilla toffee sweetness to start, oak and bourbon building in the middle, and bourbon lingering in the warm but not overly boozy finish. Hops arent especially present, but add a hint of orange oil in the finish. The medium-full body has a nice creaminess, and lacks the sticky character of some other I&G beers. A really nice beer all around, glad to have tried it.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
4354,"2016-12-20",3.6,"500 ml bottle (2015 vintage), Release No. 01/16-001, best by date of 16 DEC 20 stamped on the bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear very dark reddish/brown color with a huge, huge head. Had to let this one settle down a little while before I could get a decent pour in the glass. Aroma is sweet and malty, the brew smells like vanilla, toffee, toasted malt, nuts, and some dark fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some bourbon, molasses and dark breadiness. Mouthfeel/body is medium, its slick and has a high amount of soft carbonation. A little too much carbonation for me, but with that being said its not hard to drink at all. I thought it was an enjoyable brew, but maybe I should have drank it fresher. Still worth a try! $7.99 a bottle.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
4354,"2016-10-15",4.3,"Bottle. Consumed 2016, bottled 2015. Pours dark brown with a thick tan foam subsiding slow and residing. Scent is resin, honey, smoke, whiskey. Taste is a blissfully smooth vanilla laced scotch ale strong, biting notes of cinnamon, cocoa, vanilla, and bourbon. Hints of peated/medicinal notes. Finish is sharp and dry but still manages to be smooth due to its ethanol. Very great beer.","","Cokemonkey11"

4354,"2016-07-05",3.4,"2015 vintage. Dark brown pour, with an off white almost beige head. Aroma is sweet malts, brown sugar, and earthy barrel. Hints of roasty, and nuttiness, with some light vanilla. Carb is over the top and actually a little tough to drink. Finish is very woody, and earthy, with some more sweet malts. This seems to have alot less of their trademark buttery flavour, this is quite a bit cleaner. Low to medium bitterness, decent stuff.","Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, CANADA","robinvboyer"

Very subtle and easy drinking, was expecting more for the $20 pricetag.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"
