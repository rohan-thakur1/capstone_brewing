Taste is lemon and grain of course but with tons of juicy grapefruit, faint red berries, lime zest, pineapple, and long sour grapefruit/lemon finish. Some oaky tannins.

3936,"2014-02-09",4.0,"750 ml bottle acquired via trade. Been looking forward to this one for awhile. Pours a bright hazy yellow straw hue. Sunshine cornfield hues are a bit hazy, bright and pale with some champagne like glow. A frothy bright white head dies to a negligible ring with skant lacing. Aromas present big pleasing lactic acidity, bigger citric lemon tartness, some white grape and grapefruit juice. Some citrus rind, yogurty lemon, grainy rustic straw and cereal elements. Crisp, sour and yogurty with some cleaner light body, really nice lactic life. Potent and enjoyable, white peach and gentle sour green grape, kiwi. Lovely. Initial is lighter end of the fold, a bit slick and sour overall. Lemon rind, sour peaches, white grape and kiwi. Some straw, bready malt and yogurt cultures as we move on. Nice lactic zip keeps pushing, sustained sourness. Really nice flavors as it dries out a bit, shows some bready and straw malt as we hit the backend. The fruit presence is fairlly diverse, yogurty and fruity without just a blast of harsh lactic pop. This really works well. Lots of fruit complexity, sourness, without being overwhelming. Lotta green grape tartness, white peach, lemon, kiwi fruit and pretty tasty. Its sour but not overblown, balanced in that regard. A bit slick as that yogurty feel sticks in the finish. Quite crushable, really a nice summery session worthy beer. Can just imagine drinking this out in the shade. Tasty stuff. Nose is solid, appearance a touch lacking, but overall the beer is just lovely in flavor, balance, and flow. Perhaps a touch undercarbonated but nice stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

3936,"2013-08-25",3.9,"In short: A Berliner weisse with a lacto-barnyard-funk character. Pretty good.
How: Bottle 750ml shared with people freezing in Vermont.
The look: Cloudy dark blonde body topped by a small white head.
In long: Nose is what youd expect from the style, a mix of lemony acidity along with mild funky character. Body doesnt feel watery at all despite the low abv and the soft carbonation helps in that regard. Taste has straws and wheat, a medium lactic acid presence, dirty funk (horseblanket), come citrus fruits, light yogurt notes. Very dry finish but not astringent. Certainly more lacto-funky and less lemony-tart than what Ive come to expect from the style, this comes through as some kind of semi-funky wheat based sour ale. I liked this beer a lot.

Nice tart aroma with a touch of citrus fruit and pineapple. Some mustiness present as while. Light wheat malt aroma. A very enjoyable aroma that has me going back for more. 
Pours a very hazy yellow gold, but this did come from the bottom of the keg. Little no head or retention. 
Flavor has a good deal of acidity throughout. Nice pineapple and citrus in the flavor as well. Light barnyard mustiness to compliment the acidity. No bitterness and no astringency. Tastes a bit salty; water must have high salinity. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied, but surprisingly full for such a small beer. Medium high carbonation, could possibly be a bit higher. 
Overall a super enjoyable beer. One of my favorite styles and a great version of it.
