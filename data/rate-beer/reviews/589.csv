Im getting a few hoppy burps very soon on and there is a little stinging bitterness. I like this but I find at times its just a bit harsh and slightly rough around the edges, the chocolate is a little more suppressed than I would like, there is plenty of roastiness.

589,"2010-11-28",3.7,"Towering beige head, slowly collapsing over ruby-brown beer, leaving shards of lacerings. Sweet chocolate nose, and some faint, ureum-rich hops. Bitter-hoppy flavour, with a bit of ashes, coffee, and some more chocolate. Thankfully tasting as bitter chocolate, not as Cadburys (I was weary...) The hops are, however, all that remains in the aftertaste. Seen the rich, velvety body, enlightened by good carbonation, palate gets a well-earned 5. t Would seem that British brewers are getting the hang of bottle-conditioned special beers. This one is pretty outstanding.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
