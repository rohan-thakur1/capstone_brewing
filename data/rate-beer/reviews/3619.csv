3619,"2016-05-13",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2016 500 ml bottle bought at YATA in MOKO, Mong Kok.
Looks: Clear amber copper colour; Three-quarter finger head with off-white foam which lasts for 1 minute; Very good sticky lacing with fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and sweet Ale malt, with strong caramel, toffee, pineapple, light passion fruits, grains, floral, strong molasses, biscuits, lemon and grass.

Taste: Close to light sweet moderate Amber malt, with caramel, strong grains, floral, fair molasses, light bread, strong lemon, fairly strong bitter hops and grass.

Body: Mid to light body. Dry and slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Close to fair Ale maltyness in a pretty slick background. Caramel and strong graininess as base with shades of burnt toast. Very lemony with fairly light sweetness. Biscuity to round. Good!

Hoppiness: Pineapple, passion fruits, floral, lemon and grass in nose. Floral, strong lemon and grass in taste; Bitterness is quite strong for a lasting, medium astringent toasty malty finish.

After Taste: Quite dry. Lemony and bitter to mouth.

Comments: This ones hops has changed from Saaz to Riwaka, so its aroma is pretty tropical fruity and sweet, with toasty grainy Amber malt taste with solid lemon hoppiness. Dont really like its strong graininess, otherwise a very nice and solid Pale Ale. Expensive but still worth the money!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

The taste was delicious piny resin perfectly supported by top malt session musicians who know how to lay down a sweet unobtrusive groove. Like everybody says, this really does taste bigger than 3.7%.

It makes this beer versatile and ideally adaptable). Theres sweet mandarin and other juicy fruits on the first impression. Then the flavours settle on the tongue and spread into a soft bitterness that is grounded mainly in sweet fruits.  Becomes citrus and astringent and is quite a tasty little critter.

Quite a lot of weirdness initially (rubber, higher alcohols??) which eventually blows off. Subtle hop in that edgy, tropical, NZ way, some blackberry esters and loads of crystal malt. Mouthfeel is simultaneously creamy and quite fizzy. Your palate eventually adjusts to the huge crystal content and then you realise theres actually good base malt character behind it.

Sweet pale and crystal malts dominate the front, followed by a juicy, almost winey, note in the middle and a crisp, mediumly bitter, hop bite to finish.  More winey notes in the lingering aftertaste.  Light medium weight but a good mouthfeel due to the soft carbonation.
The number one ""session"" beer NZ has to offer in my books, though it can be difficult to get. I recommend Bar Edwards, Newton, for the best, freshest, serving youll get in Wellington.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","yalnikim"

3619,"2004-08-27",3.3,"I found this on tap at The Malthouse in Wellington. It has a good copper colour and what looks like to be a low carbonation in the glass. The appearance generally in the glass is one that doesnt make you go woohoo but more than anything this is more to do with the generosity of the barkeeps than the beer itself. The nose has a strong pine resin and some blackberries in the overall aroma. The stated 4% belies the mouthfeel and after a while the flavour is an agreeable beer. I am a bit confused with the combination of hops though, a bit like some restaurants tryig to serve a surf and turf, therefore not traditonal but neither a good combination either. In the long run the effervescence resurfaces to further bring this potentially good beer down to mediocrity.","Potts Point, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA","Sully"

3619,"2004-01-06",3.3,"great malt, toffee, brown bread and kiwi-hop aroma. taste is deep and malty and tangily bitter, but a bit too toffeeish for me.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"

3619,"2002-02-25",4.1,"Similar to their IPA.  Very piney and resiney with a nice bite.  A bit less intense than their IPA, but not much in regards to flavour.  Golden amber colour, perfect amount of malt balance and fairly light bodied compared to the flavour.  Emersons has yet to disappoint.","San Diego, California, USA","Kaya161"
