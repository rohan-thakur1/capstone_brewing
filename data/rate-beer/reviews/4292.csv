4292,"2017-05-06",3.0,"Faded yellow and a little cloudy pour with a little sediment. Taste is dusty straw followed by a dry honey bite. Crisp and refreshing. The honey finish makes it stand out","Missouri, USA","p0rkch0p"
4292,"2017-04-10",3.0,"Lovely golden body, bright, clear and clean, fading white top for a head. Crisp and fairly sharp in the mouth, grainy nose and flavor: on the sweet side, yet with a good bitter finish.","Ft. Riley, Kansas, USA","unclemike"
4292,"2017-01-07",2.9,"Nice light non-bitter non-sweet sessionable Munich lager. Straightforward and tasty with no bad surprises here. Mildly hoppy but not too much so- still low @ 23 IBUs which is perfect for a Dortmunder.","Missouri, USA","AbbeyRoade"

transparent gold, dense white head craters. Plenty of dusty grain in the nose, light dough, lightly soapy, incredibly dry. More grain in the dry profile, super high attenuation leaving awesome complex cracker profile. Light honey kiss front palate followed by dry mid, the full body backed by frothy carbonation accenting the toasty mineral-dryness in the end. So much flavor, absolutely delicious.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
4292,"2016-05-10",3.0,"Draft at Parkville fest. Clear golden yellow color, white head. Aroma of lightly peppery straw. Taste has subtle citrus. OK.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
4292,"2015-04-09",3.2,"On tap at the brewery. It poured a bright golden color with a white head. The aroma was of bread, malts, a touch of hops and grass. The taste was similar to the aroma with grass, bread, honey, hops and malts. Nice.","Wentzville, Missouri, USA","jandd1983"
4292,"2015-02-04",3.0,"Tap - good size foamy head, clear light gold color, sweet light malt aroma and flavor, fair noble hop like bitterness, pretty good for the style

4292,"2015-01-01",3.1,"Bright, clean, and nearly sessionable. Very basic, but its a good take on the style.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","ads135"
4292,"2014-11-11",3.5,"Several glasses from a growler filled two hours previously at the brewery in Kansas City, Missouri. The pour is crystal clear golden yellow with a well formed one inch white head. Pretty beer. The aroma is bread biscuit malt, along with grass. The taste is a simple and clean blend of the fresh bread slightly sweet cracker malt and the grass hops. The palate is medium to light bodied, active carbonation and a clean finish. Easy drinking beer, nice one.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
4292,"2014-06-25",4.9,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2014 I take this to be KC Bier Cos middle-of-the-road flagship beer. It tastes as it is described in the commercial description. Its a delicious medium-bodied lager and very easy to drink.","Kansas, USA","keith0718"
4292,"2014-05-26",3.9,"Sampler at the brewery. Another stellar rendition. Perfectly clean, no flaws, great clean malts with a subtle noble hop character. Carbonation makes this go down so easy and maybe the best helles I have drank in a while.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
4292,"2014-04-24",3.6,"On tap at the brewery. Comes a clear bright gold with a nice white head. Aroma of bread and grass. Taste is grass, bread, and malt. Well done. Very enjoyable.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
4292,"2014-03-27",3.3,"Half liter pour at the brewery. Really pretty to look at, gorgeous brilliant yellow body with active bubbles. Thick foamy bright white head. Nose is stereotypical ""German"" beer scent - gentle noble hops, fresh bread, and and a tinge of malt. The taste was also right on target for the style, while the mouthfeel was a bit thicker than I expected. Perfectly satisfied my craving for a German lager. Ill be back.","Fairway, Kansas, USA","Crash_the_dog"
