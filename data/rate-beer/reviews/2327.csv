2327,"2016-12-31",4.1,"Bottle at the brewery. Pours dark, black or very nearly, with minimal head. The aroma is great, really complex, notes of a Belgian dark strong, yeast, overripe dark fruits, prune and plum, port wine, vanilla. The flavor is also bomb, sweet and complex, tannic and port-like, lots of overripe fruit. Full bodied, booze that smacks you but is well integrated. Low carbonation. Really enjoyable.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

2327,"2016-02-08",3.9,"12-oz from the cellar book at HOTD. Pours an opaque near-black with a thin light tan head that falls away quickly. Big sweet nose, showing figs, prunes, tawny port, vanilla.

2327,"2016-01-03",4.0,"12 oz bottle purchased at the brewery tap room (Portland, OR). From their vintag e bottle list. Pours a nice deeper hazy brownish hue, a touch of reddish rusty color shows a bit of life through a hazy, darker body. Loose tannish bubbly head dies down to a mellow ringer, subtle lacing is mellow. Aromas are a lot of berry and thicket fruit, raspberry and cherry meet mellow oak, strawberry and some sweeter jammy appeal. Some carmelized and brown sugar malts, a bit of candi sugar and Belgian yeast come into focus. A gentle funkiness, earth, and oak. Nice, richer, fruity and a bit sweet. Initial is a bit tannic and tart, some sour strawberry and cherry elements meld into deadened sweeter malts. Caramel, brown sugar, a bit of biscuit. Earth, gentle yeasty Belgian influence. Softened tannic vanilla and oak. A nice tartness, very seedy fruity appeal is raspberry pulp, seedy strawberry. Rich, flavorful, a bit rich and overripe. Plum elements, subtle sweeter cocoa mixes with black cherries, earth and a bit of carmelized appeal. Oak, earth, some tart spritzy cherries cut through a decent carmelized and sweeter caramel thicker malt body. I think it really works in the end. Tart, tannic, a bit of gentle warmth and biscuit, subtle Belgian yeast, vanilla and warmth. That tart cranberry and rapsberry backend really sticks with me and clears this up really nice. Finish is dry, a touch sticky and carmelized with lingering tart fruit, oak and fig, raspberries and cherries, biscuits and subtle Belgian candi sugar and yeast. Really interesting jammy tart stuff. A melange of flavors, fruity tart nose shows dried cranberries, tart raspberries, earth and some tannic barrel appeal that melds well. While its not the prettiest pour the nose is punchy, the flavors complex and a melange of fruity tartness available beneath. A thinned body plays well with good flavors and a gently sticky yet tart berry trail out. Fun stuff. Lovely collab and blend, I think.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

2327,"2013-12-28",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 29, 2014 Bottle: Thanks, Kevin! Kind of a half assed rating based off of the three sips I was able to get before my cab ride was waiting for me to leave. Deep mahogany & lavender-tinted pour, not much of a head at all, & not really even a ring... Just a few, lonely carbonation bubbles that surface. Aroma is slightly quad-like with notes of dark fruits, plums, raisins, some brown sugar, a hint of leather, & some wet oak-y tannins. It has that typical ""Hair of the Dog"" scent... tobacco-ish, burnt leather-like, in the background. Taste is robust, with big notes of brown sugar coated plums & figs, bourbon soaked oak, cocoa dust, molasses, & a light hint of leather-y smoke underneath. Pretty staunch & boozy, but very tasty.

Bottle: The aroma consists of fruit, raisin, brown sugar, chocolate, oak, and faint floral notes. It pours a dark brown with some faint orange highlights and a minimal beige head that quickly fads to a very fine ring around the edges of the glass. The flavor starts with fruit, chocolate, brown sugar, and faint cola. The finish has molasses, oak, vanilla, and a hint of maple syrup.

2327,"2013-12-27",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 14, 2016 Original rating. Bottle at the brewery. OMFG! Im feeling a member of the beer 31337 to be number fourteen to try this one. As a huge fan of the Struisse pannepots of all stripes, trying this is a dream come true. Pretty cool too how the waitress brings out the bottle, lets me look at the label, and then taste a first sip --- eat my balls, wine snobs!

Dark murky brown pour pushing black, basically no head. Totally jammy aroma; while Id say plum I understand the claim of strawberry in the commercial description. Initially I get very little with in the HOTD tulip filled near to the brim. This is the only reason this doesnt pull a 10 for aroma. But once I get a few sips into the beer, letting it warm and develop aroma space in the glass, I get a huge jammy thing going on, plum by my first call but I understand the strawberry in the commercial description and dammit---what is it---gooseberry? As it warms, pureed dark raisin. I dont know. In any event, delicious, delicious jammy aroma. 
Flavor: It is decidedly non-trivial to describe everything going on here. 
The pureed dark raisin in the aroma provides the principal note in the flavor. Beyond that, lots of booze. Brandy. More than Struisses variants and more than is desirable. This drops the taste to a ""mere"" 8/10. That which, when found in a beer, is described as tootsie roll. Less overt spice than Struisses pannepots offer. Most beers at 13% burn. This one merely simmers. Id have called it a 9%. Well hidden! 9/3/8/4/18=4.2
I bet this one would age like Apple stock options circa 1991. And with four bottles to go, so Ill find out in good time.
Revisit. Trying this one at home in late Sept. 2014, Im totally underwhelmed. Opens with almost no puff and pours with almost no head. Its basically a hot, sticky mess. I just cant figure what I saw in it before, and only drank half the bottle before tucking the other half away in the fridge to be forgotten. Id go about 7/3/7/3/14=3.4 this time, but Im not going to blend that rating in unless the next of my remaining bottles flops yet again. Strange! 
Second revisit. 2013 bottle December 2016. Another flop. Totally flat this time, quite hot, lots of aggressive spice character that isnt doing it for me at all. 3.3 at best. Im leaving the original rating because of the time-and-place, but this is not a beer Id buy again. 8/2/7/2/13=3.2. Im going to rate this a bit higher, though.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

2327,"2013-11-14",4.1,"Bottle: &nbsp Deep burnt brown sugar with a slight plum hue, thin soapy off-white head, little lacing. &nbsp Certainly looks aged! &nbsp Plum fruitiness, some oak, cherry tootsie roll. &nbsp Similar tongue, warming, smooth, caramel, deep plums, fruity chocolate, molasses, very clean. &nbsp Very slick on the tongue. &nbsp Surprised this is 13%. &nbsp Its just shy of being Cognac like. &nbsp Had it been hotter and more viscous I would have said so. &nbsp Delicious, and too easy to drink!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
2327,"2013-11-11",4.1,"On tap at HOTD. Colour...cloudy amber with little head. Nose..quite fruity indeed with a lean towards macerated cherries and plums that have been soaked in brandy and pinot must. Palate...oh sweet spirits of brandy! Not a brandy bomb but the brandy is quite evident! Theres loads of fruity goodness here and sone funk to boot. The finish lingers nicely and despite the brandy presence the 12% is quite stealthy!","Portland, Oregon, USA","neepsntatties"
2327,"2013-11-10",3.7,"On tap at the 20th Anniversary event. Cheers! This was a tough one to gauge for me, it was very odd and complex. Pours a cloudy toffee colored brew with really no head. The aroma is massive overripe fruits, especially apple cider and some booze. The flavor is similarly dominated by sweet apples, some vanilla, pulling some malty sweetness, yeasty at times. Very much a different beer than the two base (I say that generally) beers. Good altogether.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
2327,"2013-11-10",3.9,"Draft at the source for the 20th anniversary celebration. Deep dark maroon color, almost flat. Aroma of figs, prunes, vanilla. Taste is sweet dates, vanilla, port wine. Tasty.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
2327,"2013-11-09",3.8,"On tap at anniversary.

A: Dead head with a dark mahogany body.

N: Lots of rye bread. Figs and brandy. Raisins and prunes. Very dense.

T: Cloying sweetness with a lot more bread. Some hop. Adam and Pannepots are evident if not synced.

M: Very, very dense and oily. Carbonation is good.

O: Good, but not 15 per bottle good. Ah well.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
2327,"2013-11-09",4.2,"Tap taster at brewery. Deep dark brown. Aroma of raisin, plum, wood, and molasses. Taste is much the same but berry tartness in there.","British Columbia, CANADA","XaenDovet"
2327,"2013-11-09",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 12, 2013 Pour at the Hair of the Dog anniversary party. Dark brown with pretty much no head. Aroma is raisins, dates, plums, molasses, prunes, honey, hint of earthy wood. Syrupy mouthfeel, full bodied, sweet and luxurious on the palate with a ton of complex dark fruit flavours and a hint of booze on the finish. Taste is raisins, dates, prunes, brown sugar, maple syrup, currants. Yum!","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","GothGargoyle"
2327,"2013-11-08",4.3,"Bottle @ HotD... Poured dark brown, near black, mahogany color with a thin, beige ring of a head. Aroma of dark, plum-like and vinous fruits with deep alcohol spirit notes. Very complex in the aroma pulling in different directions. Like a rich dessert. Mouthfeel was soft, expansive and really coated the palate. Small amount of carbonation, not fizzy or bubbly feeling at all. Which is fine considering the massive booziness of this beer. Tasted like a rich fortified wine. A great digestif. Notes of dark fruits, raisins, molasses, licorice, cocoa powder, sugary candied tones along with a kicking alcohol character that didnt necessarily lend to either brandy or bourbon but just stood out and worked harmoniously with the other characters of the beer. Not so much in the way of yeast character. Cherry-like, dark fruit and sweet finish.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
