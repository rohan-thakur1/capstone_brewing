1853,"2016-11-12",3.8,"On tap @ Rogue SF. Pours clear pale orange amber with thin white head. Aroma is sugary sweet caramel malt, plenty of bourbon and oak as well. Taste is more of the same. Roasty caramel malt, light bourbon, dry and clean on the finish. This is a pretty much a barleywine, perhaps the lowest abv one around. Bourbon works really well with the base Dead Guy flavor profile.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"

Got some whisky in there though, quite nice.","Chevy Chase, Maryland, USA","altonbrownd"
1853,"2015-06-05",3.2,"Lightly hazed, golden amber color with a diminished taupe head. Interesting aroma of Citrus, bourbon and caramel. Still seems to possess the a clean lager nose. Come unglued in the flavors. A tangled mix of malt, bourbon and hops, that dont seem to like each other. Start is lightly sweet and citric. Middle continues with the citric and just a touch of bourbon. A whiskey on the rocks with a twist flavor. Hints of malt bounce in and out. Things never seem to come together. Some decent flavors that never seem to meet and instead distract. I really wanted to like this one more.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1853,"2014-12-14",3.6,"Bottle share. 
Poured into a tulip. Sorry, it wasnt a pilsener glass. I think itll be okay. 
The appearance was a nice looking hazy amber to orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. There wasnt any lacing.
The smell had a nice blend of sweet honey to somewhat tart cherry. 
The taste was mainly sweet and somewhat tart carrying the cherry back into the flavor. Light tart cherry aftertaste leading into a slight bittersweet finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Theres a nice carbonation about it. 
Overall, I say this was a pretty good Maibock even though I didnt have it in proper glassware. Id still have this again. Maybe recommend with some plain cheesecake.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

1853,"2014-10-05",4.0,"this is Dead Guy Ale aged in Dead Guy Whiskey barrels! on tap (but outside-so in a plastic cup). as a frame of reference ive got the ok but passable Dead Guy at 3.1, and the tasty Double Dead Guy at 3.9. This was better than either of those. It was poured cold, but with a thick frothy tan head. smelled great, but mostly malt and earthy hops. not a lot of whisky. super mellow, but flavorful. smooth as hell. id already liked it, but when it started to warm, the whisky came out and played very nicely with the aroma and flavor, while never overpowering the beer.

1853,"2014-05-23",3.6,"Transfer from BA review on 3-16-12 - 
Served in a 10 oz chalice glass

Appearance  Served a nice light golden orange color with a thin white head. The head was light and faded fast giving way to only a small amount of lacing, but leaving a very persistent layer of wispy foam on the surface of the beer.

Smell  Bourbon is pretty potent in the nose. There are hints of some caramel, juniper, and flowery/earthy hop mixed in with the aroma as well. Quite nice.

Taste  While the nose would have suggested a whole lot of bourbon barrel flavor, it was really quite light. The flavor was a bit more on the side of tart fruit mixed with some carmel flavors. Throughout the taste there are some more spicy flavors. While hard to pinpoint the exact identities they seem to intensify more toward the end and leave an interesting aftertaste in the mouth. Not bad, but not great either, just sorta unique.

Mouthfeel  The body is creamy and the carbonation is rather light. It overall creates a very smooth and easy drinking experience and allows the brew to cling to the tongue.

Overall  This was an interesting beer. It had a rather odd flavor profile in my opinion, kind of random, but nothing was really all that off. Although I dont think I would drink this beer on frequent occasion, it is worth a try.","","Darkmagus82"
1853,"2014-02-20",4.0,"The candy coated nose full of caramel and toasty malts is hiding at the end in this tasty beer. At first taste you get a salty mix of bitterness and whiskey. As you venture through this beer it mellows out quite nicely as the toasty malt notes in the middle starts to expand into sweet caramel notes that linger in your pallet. I would expect the head to be boring on this beer, other than that, it was well worth the wait and the best of the John Johns....","","navajojoe"

1853,"2013-10-08",3.7,"Purchased a case of this at the brewery and have had it in my cellar for approx 2 years. Opened the first bottle on 10/2/13. Poured amber with a nice initial head but dissipated fairly quickly. Aroma immediately has a strong essence of the Dead Guy Whiskey barrel, then the nutty maltiness of Dead Guy Ale comes through. A very nice mouthfeel with flavors of caramel, nuts, wood, and a slight (but noticeable) ethanol finish. Has a sweeter profile, much like regular Dead Guy. Ive had this on tap at the brewery and it is my opinion that the cellaring has greatly improved this beer! It is much more balanced and synchronized compared to the fresh John John which tasted like Dead Guy with a bit of whiskey mixed in. Overall, it is a definite winner in my book.","Sweet Home, Oregon, USA","Salmoniform"

1853,"2013-07-20",1.1,"This beer was TERRIBLE...Just TERRIBLE.
I chilled the beer to 50 degrees and poured it into a 4 ounce snifter.
The color looked good, a golden-brown ale.
Smell was OK, could smell the whiskey barrel aging a bit and thought this might be a decent drink.
Took a mouthful and holy what the heck...a combination of sour elephant dung, decaying squid heads, and pig urine in a thin watery Budweiser-like fluid. This bottle must have been a bad batch...thats all I can honestly think. It was clear though so I think it was a non-infected beer - just horrible as heck.
I paid $12 for this???
So I let it warm up and took a sip every few minutes thinking, ""this is going to improve as the temp gets warmer"".
No Such Luck. This remained feces in a bottle.
I felt obligated to drink it after dropping so much coin on it so I decided to mix it with a stout to make it palatable. No way, it just ruined the stout.
I dumped out the remaining 14 ounces and Im so dis-a-frickin-pointed.
Ive had a few other Rogue brews and while Im not an avid fan, they do make a few decent beers (Old Crustacean). ..but this one???OH man If I could get a refund, I would be all over that.","California, USA","Belchmaster"

No born on date, but supposedly fresh from the truck.

A - Pours a slightly hazed amber/red. 2 fingers of cream colored head looks thick and blankets the ceiling with micro-bubbles.

S - Bready malt, alcohol vapors, golden grahams cereal, faint fruit, hints of vanilla, bright fruit, peaches,

T - Bright caramel, honey sweetness, very bready, suggestions of wood, clean but doughy yeast (if that makes sense), peaches, toasted grains covered in honey.

M - Very smooth feel, light to medium bodied, semi-sweet finish.

Bright and bready are 2 words that would describe this beer.

If it wasnt printed on the label I would have never guessed this was aged on whiskey barrels.
The signature pacman yeast is very present.(nutty and doughy) The barrels seem to add creaminess and hints of vanilla. (I guess) Nice fruit profiles and nice honey flavor.

A solid beer that has grains of barrel aging and pulls it off. Outrageously overpriced so this is a one and done.

1853,"2013-06-02",3.8,"On tap at george and dragon. Orange colour with white head. Honey, caramel, malt aroma. Strong honey, sweet taste. Also caramel and malts. Light body.","Barcelona, SPAIN","BRW"
1853,"2013-05-26",2.9,"Appearance:
A slightly cloudy orange under a thin splash of a white head bordered by a thin white collar. Swirls with little change.

Nose:
Malt forward followed by oak with caramel and vanillin in the back. Sauced apples sprinkled with cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger.

Palate:
Thin mouthfeel and presentation of flavors overall with a fast finish. Sauced apples with mingle with caramel. Cinnamon-sugar and nutmeg. Raw cinnamon powder makes the top of my tongue tingle. Bitter orange rind and oak finish. Apple skins.

Final Thoughts:
Rogues Dead Guy is an original classic that helped kick-start the craft beer re-evolution along with all our other founding fathers. This barrel-aged variant was a toss-up for me; some of it I loved and some I did not. I enjoyed the additional complexity the oak added, but on the flip-side, it thinned out the palate more than I would have liked.

A: The beer is hazy orange-amber in color. It poured into my snifter with a head barely thick enough to cover the ale that quickly died down to a thin partial film over the surface and a thin ring around the edge of the glass.
S: Moderately strong aromas of malts, whiskey and wood in the somewhat fruity nose.  Interesting and complex, although not a perfect mix in my nose. 
T: The flavor is better than the aroma, with a solid malt/barley base, beer is quite malty and notes of wood and whiskey from the barrel aging process. Hints of yeast, spicy and herbal hops, honey and dark fruits are also present in the taste.
M: On the high side of medium-bodied with a very good, low-moderate amount of carbonation. Quite smooth with nearly no alcohol harshness.

Aroma: The nose is caramel malts, fruit, bourbon, vanilla, wood, and yeast

Flavor: The taste is mid-sweet, with vanilla, bourbon, and fruit, and it has a light bitterness on the finish

1853,"2011-10-29",3.9,"Bottle from South Bay Drugs: In the nose, it kind of smells like an English barley wine, but there is a faint scent of wood and vanilla along with some aromas of honey and brittle toffee styled malts. As for the liquid, it was a glimmering straw gold color with a thin layer of creamy foam.  The flavor is semi sweet with a bitter bite in the aftertaste, but there are a considerate amount of signature Rogue hops and wood barrel. I dont know though, the whole concept of barrel aging a beer as boring as Dead Guy ale did give some added flavors and complexity, but I would think it more ideal for Rogue to BA some of their stronger ales and stouts. Who knows? Maybe those Shakespeare stouts or crustacean barley wines can really develop some transformation and make for a more interesting study of how the barrel does round out the flavor and the high alcohol content. I still enjoyed this beer a lot, and thought it to be a recipe by Rogue worth mentioning to friends.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

1853,"2011-03-20",3.3,"Bomber. Poured into Duvel tulip. 

APPEARANCE:

Pours deep golden orange with amber hues. Hazy. Large 2 finger head is somewhat pillowy, off-white Baileys Irish cream colored, and has medium retention duration. 


AROMA: Malty, some earthy/spicy hops, subtle wood aroma, some vanilla-like characteristics from the wood (though more like vanilla extract than vanilla bean), and faint spice. Good amount of wet cereal grain. Wood aroma is somewhat off  like some old cheap wood; hardly as pleasant as some other oak aromas that I have experienced. Unable to discern much whiskey notes on nose. Some light char aroma, which was somewhat pleasant. As it warms up, aroma exhibits much more old wood (unpleasant) as well as faint whiskey notes (pleasant). 


TASTE: Malt, cereal, and some hops dominate. 

Light vanilla as well as some faint taste of old wood on mid palate. 

Back of palate has subtle whiskey note. 

Faint copper/metallic taste on finish. 

Some bitterness on finish. Hops on finish as well as back of palate seem somewhat spicy with light earthy notes. Finish also has a faint spice character that seems like a combination of spice tastes from the hops as well as the barrel. 

MOUTH FEEL: On the lighter side of medium bodied. Crisp, nice carbonation. Semi-dry. Extremely faint alcohol warmth  likely it is this discernable at this abv because the body is quite thin. 


OVERALL: Expected more whiskey notes on aroma and taste. Plenty of cereal taste. Overall, like slightly bitter cereal. Unable to say am biggest fan of the style, though found it ok. At the least, the complexities from light barrel aging can be appreciated. Wanted to like it more than I did. Brilliant concept; less than spectacular execution. Perhaps if both the whiskey as well as the beer (at their separate stages) were aged in the barrel longer, this would be a more interesting beer. According to Rogue: the whiskey only sits in the barrel 30 days, and the beer only sits in the used whiskey barrel 2+ months  each stage could have been longer.","San Diego, California, USA","AHTOH"

The aroma of this beer is dominated by the barrel character with hints of earthy oak, sweet boozy whiskey, vanilla, marshmallow and toasted coconut. Underneath there is some pale malt character with hints of toffee, biscuit and hazelnut but the nose is all about the barrel.

Medium bodied with a very prominent whiskey barrel flavor that overpowers most of the other characteristics and lingers into a slightly hot, dry finish. Lots of whiskey flavor without being overly hot with hints of toasted, earthy oak, vanilla and toasted coconut. The base beer is overpowered but underneath there are still hints of pale malt, caramel, toffee and biscuit. Its still pretty good, and at the relatively low ABV, pretty easy to drink but it could stand to be more balanced and have a little less one-dimensional whiskey barrel flavor.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
1853,"2011-02-28",2.7,"Bottle, shared with Parksy. Light hazy amber, brief whispy head. Aroma is very odd-- the expected oaky sweet barrel character is inescapable, but underlying this is a mealy dogfood-ish smell that is not very appealing to me. Palate is sweet and boozy, with tons of vanilla oaky wood. This solves a bit of an ongoing question for me: does barrel aging actually work with a pale malted beer base? Innis &Gunn have built a business around this idea, but my main criticism of their brews has been the lack of malt structure and quantity in their beers, so Im never sure whether the concept fails, or just I&Gs execution of the concept. Well, I know for a fact that the base beer here is outstanding, and since it clearly takes nothing positive away from barrel aging, it leaves me to say that barrel aging is best left to toasted and roasted malt brews, as the pale malt character here has been drowned in the barrel.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

1853,"2011-02-26",2.5,"22oz Bottle. Thanks for sharing, Jeff. Going in, I was suprised to see the choice of Dead Guy for barrel aging. I didnt think a pale, above-average hoppy Maibock could really hold up to a barrel. And it didnt. There wasnt anything wrong with execution of this beer, just the concept. Nose brings big oak and raw whiskey. Flavors are similar with added sweetness and no sign of the base beer. Youd be hard pressed to pick a family beneath what is essentially beer-rinsed barrel dregs. I refuse to give this points for being a good Heller Bock because its barrel aged.

1853,"2010-10-17",3.5,"A solid pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a four finger thick, tan colored head that leaves lots of nicely layered lacing on the sides of my glass.  The beer is an amber color that shows a hazed, gold-amber hue when held up to the light.  As I pour this it smells salty and perhaps smoky like a whiskey can be.  A focused smell of this beer shows ample coconut notes and vanillin, it is hard to get much of anything else.  Since this beer is only ~6.5% it doesnt have the heat that many a barrel aged beer does, and this is rather nice.  Some buttery oak notes and perhaps a hint of nutty, caramelized malt round things out.  I could honestly be imagining the malt influence as the barrel is so clearly dominant in the nose; luckily it is nice and smooth, such that this is enjoyable to smell.

My first sip is lightly sweet up front with a caramelized malt character, while the finish has some tart whiskey notes as well as some light coconut and oak-spice woodiness.  The spiciness in the finish seems to take on the role of balancing sharpness that a hop bitterness usually plays.  The middle of this beer has a nice buttery oak note that is wrapped up in the toasted coconut flavors, but the butter character is more dominant in the flavor than the coconut.  This has enough body to stand up to the barrel and actually has quite a bit of viscous body given the beer strength.

An interesting beer, perhaps a bit simplistic, but I am actually enjoying this more than I thought I would.  The base beer is definitely thoroughly dominated by the barrel character, but I like that such a light beer is able to not let this get too out of control.  You definitely will have to enjoy Whiskey-barrel aged beers to like this and I like that this is not hot and that the Whiskey character is so smooth.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Pours a rather vibrant ruby red to rust ornage with a high level of carbonation and a large billowing head thats a full inch high. The nose is very fruity and floral; though there is some woody notes likely due to the barrel aging. The hops accentuate the floral notes, this beer makes my mouth water. Light mouthfeel from such a complex beer, I was expecting it to be somewhat syrupy but its not nearly that heavy. Kind of disappointing, actually. The first thing you notice about the beer is the finish. Up front it has all the qualities of a nice pale ale. Theres some fruity hop things going on giving way to malt sweetness. But the finish to this beer is almost mind blowing. Theres this terrific flowered wood finish that reminds me of a creek in spring, or something similar. I dont really care for the minor alcohol notes, most likely from the aging process, but thats to be expected given this style of beer. As the beer opens up it gives you a lot more from the flavor profile. The hops are floral. I get lavendar, marigold, maybe even lillies. Quite lovely. These accent the sweet caramel malt, finally leading into that wonderful finish. Its a very circular flavor, if that makes sense. Theres not a lot of breadiness or biscuit qualities to this beer, its very light on the palate and quite delacte.

The whiskey/oak flavors arent overpowering at all, I thought it would be somewhat stronger in the taste since the whiskey/oak aromas were stronger.

Touch of menthol. The whiskey is just a bit disproportionate to the underlying brew. Modestly hoppy, with a fair amount of bitterness and hints of citrus and spice. Coarse, hot, oaken finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-low carbonation.

Drinkability: Uncomfortably unbalanced. Honestly, its a bit tough to finish off. An accompanying glass of water was immediately requested. If someone had asked me what I thought would be the top ten best candidates for barrel-aging of any kind from the Rogue stable, DGA would have been absent from the list.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Palate is medium light, moderate carbonation, and a slick mouthfeel.

Caramelized cereals, citrusy hops, wooden barrel notes and their spicy contributions coexist peacefully in this well executed but forgettable Strong Ale.

-A ring of foam surrounds the hazy light amber.
-Carbonation is prickly, almost pushy.<br<
-For a brew in the 6% abv range, I would expect more drinkability. 
-The overall flavor profile is balanced.

The barrel aspects meld with the fruit notes to produce an orange-blossom creamed honey effect that I just love.

The palate is also more subtle than regular Dead Guy.  It still shows some malt sweetness, but it is clearly dialed back in its intensity.  Again, some caramel and Munich malt flavors.

The flavors are completely overwhelmed by a bourbon essence.  It starts off as a dry caramel malt with just a hint of biscuit, some vanilla follows mid-palate, and some dry-hopping at the finish gets a whooping kick of bourbon sting (and effervescence) to close the pull.  Not boozy, per se, because the mouthfeel is quite lighter than I wouldve thought for such an array of whiskey characteristics.  A bit pungent on the tongue, it has an active texture surrounding a medium body.  All-in-all, it is a different brew, and a rather interesting one to rate.

As I eased into my next try, I sensed some spiciness and ripe orange, or more tangerine rind. The flavor mimicked this fruity note, and presented a medium bitterness, somewhat light body, and average carbonation. Too style perplexed to go into more detail or search for more notes.

The hops for this brew provides a very grassy flavor that combines with the low toasted malt character later in the tasting. Very mild caramel notes come through at the tail end. Body is light with very high carbonation which creates a very dry feeling at the end. Overall I was a bit disappointed. Almost no whiskey or oak character were carried into the brew.

1853,"2010-02-05",3.0,"Pours a transparent copper amber with a clingy-lacing off-white head.  Aroma of semi-sweet grainy caramel and maize with a touch of butterscotch and whiskey.  Starts with decent fullness and a well-dissolved carbonation with some grainy corn notes and semi-sweet light caramel malts before a drier, slightly warming finish.  It doesnt seem like the heller-bock style has meshed that well with the whiskey flavors.  Probably wouldve been better off putting Shakespeare Stout in the whiskey barrels.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1853,"2010-02-05",3.9,"650 ml bottle from Bev4less. Pours a slightly cloudy copper color with a small white head that dissipates to a fine film.The aroma is distinct with  perfume, spice, florals and whiskey. The taste is whiskey forward with a distinct, but watered down, bourbon character. The floral notes detected in the nose are evident as part of the whiskey base. Also present is a bit caramel and some biscuit. The palate is full and malty with lively carbonation. The finish is long and dry with lingering salty bourbon. Overall: A very interesting and tasty concoction.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"
1853,"2010-02-05",3.3,"Bottle courtesy of ilovedarkbeer. Clear golden yellow with small sediment. Big sweet smell with citrus notes. Small oaky notes. Sweet flavor that leaves an alcohol burn. Slight whisky flavor. Finishes with maltedness. Dry finish.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"
1853,"2010-02-05",3.3,"Nose is a little weak. Some orange juicy notes - a touch over the hill perhaps, light wood and a hint of whiskey. Pours hazy golden with a thin touch of head. The flavor is light whiskey notes, woody barrel, sweeter fruity malts, and a touch more orange juice. Interesting beer to age in a barrel. Thin and not much going on to make it that interesting.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
1853,"2010-02-05",3.7,"Had a 5 oz. sampler at Capones. A complex beer that has a noticeable change in character as you drink more. Starts out primarily hoppy, but gets more of a smooth whiskey flavor the more you drink. I liked this.","Wayne, Pennsylvania, USA","pilgrimoutlaw"

1853,"2010-02-04",3.5,"Draught at Capones:  Faint aroma of whiskey and a hint of oak.  Poured orange/amber in color with a large, creamy, dense, off-white head that diminished but lasted throughout.  Cloudy.  Lightly sparkling.  Full of tiny particles throughout.  Excellent lacing.  Flavor is lightly sweet.  Tastes of whiskey, oak, vanilla, and slight bitter hops.  Medium body.  Average carbonation.  Whiskey, oak, and hop finish is lightly sweet.","King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA","michael-pollack"
1853,"2010-02-03",3.6,"Bottle pours semi-clear orange color with white head that doesnt last long.  Aroma is very subtle whiskey notes.  I had to smell this a couple times to make sure I was getting it right it was so subtle.  Medium light mouthfeel.  Almost watery.  Not good for a BA brew.  Flavor was a bit 1 dimensional.  The malt base is pretty much non existent and there is a smooth whiskey profile that finishes somewhat dry.  I get the oak, vanilla, some orange like flavors from grand marnier, and it has the makings of an amazing brew.  But it disappoints.  In a big way.  I give this an average rating because its about as average as you can get.  Which for me is a big disappointment because most beers that are barrel aged are so complex.  Too bad this one is pretty plain.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","fiver29"
1853,"2010-02-02",2.9,"Bomber.  Poured clear, honeyed orange with a short, fizzy-ish cap of off-white head.  The aroma picked up vanilla beans, honey, and sweet caramel laced with tangy oak and light whiskey.. soft, slick, and sweet overall.  The flavor found the same vanilla, honey, and caramel at the core, with a greater whiskey and tangy oak presence around.. sharp oak and lightly bitter earth on the edges.. whiskey, vanilla, and caramel on the finish.  Medium-bodied and very slick on the palate.. low carbonation.. the whiskey stuck for a little while on the sweet finish.. this wasnt bad, but it really seemed uninspired.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1853,"2010-02-02",3.0,"Tap at Fiddlers.

Relatively light pour with an ample head. Boozy nose, the alcohol fumes washing out most anything else beyond a general syrupy sweetness.  Mouthfeel is thin and hot, with the heat probably more an illusion from the whiskey fumes than from the alcohol. Somewhat pleasant sweetness to the flavor, a relatively nice change to have whiskey-aged beer that isnt over the top on the oak, but ultimately there is not enough going on here in the flavor profile to make up for the other deficiencies.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
1853,"2010-02-01",3.4,"Bottle. Moderate roasted and cereal for the malt, herbs for the hops, light soap for the yeast, with hints of cask wood in the background. Head is fizzy, off-white with no lacing and is mostly diminishing. Flavor starts moderately acidic and finishes lightly sweet, moderately acidic and heavily bitter. Palate is light to medium, watery with a fizzy carbonationa and very dry and lightly astringent finish. This Heller Bock has a huge hop profile. I would think with the barrel aging this would have been much mellower than Dead Guy, but its quite bitey.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"
1853,"2010-01-30",3.2,"Bomber from Binnys in Downers Grove, Illinois:  Basically, it looks, smells, and tastes like Dead Guy Ale aged in a whiskey barrel for, oh, one week, maybe two.  Its got an amber/orange body with a tall white head that provides plenty of lace.  The aroma is sweet and caramelly with a touch of stone fruit and a whole lot of booze.

1853,"2010-01-30",3.1,"22 oz. bottle.  Pours a hazy rust color with a HUGE light-tan head that leaves chunks of lacing behind.  A subtle aroma with hints of caramel and honey.  Thin to medium-bodied.  The flavor starts with some touches of caramel and honey.  Finishes with just a bit of citrus and a gently drying, crisp biscuitiness.  The slightest bit of vanilla imparts some smoothness throughout.  Not a bad beer, just not a whole lot going on here at all.","Washington DC, USA","lamas"

1853,"2010-01-28",3.5,"Bottle 22oz tasting at work.  Not bad.
Aroma is a light blend of vanilla, caramel, and whisky.
 Appearance is an amber pour with some haze and a minimal white head with little to no lacing.
 Taste opens up the nose more, but is still lighter than what one would expect from a whiskey aged beer. Slight sweet start finishes bitter with a whiskey backbone.
 Light body with a creamy texture and average to soft carbination on the palate.  Finish, as mentioned, is medium long and slightly bitter with more notes of vanilla, caramel, and whisky.
  Overall, it isnt what you would expect from a barrel aged beer, but the flavor of both the beer and whisky backbone are a welcome combination.  I wouldnt mind having it again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","Overml01"

1853,"2009-12-10",3.1,"On tap at Seraveza. Well, it may be slightly better then Dead Guy only due to less diacetyl present. The barrel seemed to contribute little except for some hot boozy fusels. Caramel up front, slightly nutty and dry, finish was rounded off with some fusels and a faint hint of oak. I think this needs longer in the barrel with more time to let the fusels subside.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
1853,"2009-08-01",3.7,"Tap @ AnniBrew 2 Barrel Aged Beer Festival...  Poured orange with a slightly, off-white head.  Esters and whiskey-like grains on the nose.  Well carbonated with creamy, lactic characters and a whiskey alcohol zing.  Malty finish with overall low hop presence.  Also a bready, pastry like sweetness and maybe an orange peel fruit flavor.Earlier Rating: 6/22/2009 Total Score: 3.5Tap @ Saraveza...  Poured orange with a white head.  Aroma of yeast and biscuity malts.  Some noticeable vanilla and smoked whiskey tones, but not a strong bittering alcohol flavor as I would hope for.  Otherwise, very smooth with big malts and sweet almond and baked goodness.  A little reminder of the whiskey in the finish with a hint of smoked oak or other wood-like characters.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
