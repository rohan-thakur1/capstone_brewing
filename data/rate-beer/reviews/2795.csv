2795,"2008-09-20",2.8,"UPDATED: SEP 30, 2008  Draught  Very good head, dense & creamy over clear amber beer. Sweetish, citrussy smell (oranges) and some caramelmalts, rather subdued. Dry, very malty and caramelly flavour with again a citrus touch. End nearly sugary sweet, totally at odds with the start. I seem to get a tad of diacetyl too. Sticky mouthfeel, seems partly unfermented. Too sweet by half.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
