2836,"2017-05-21",3.3,"UPDATED: MAY 22, 2017 Can. Almost clear pale gold with a white head. 3+ Aroma of crackers and grain with lemon and light spices. Clean. Sweet pale malt is less grainy than expected from the aroma. Clean with lower bitterness than hoped for, but the finish dries out a bit and its nicely spicy at the end. A bit on the sweet side for me with undistinguished malt character. OK. [next day] Eh, a little colder and the sweetness is more subdued and the nice finish shines a bit more.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

2836,"2017-05-14",3.8,"Thanks to Chris for this very refreshing offering. Robe claire parsemée de fines bulles lentes. Tête bien construite et persistante. Arômes frais et granuleux desquels émane un houblonnage à leuropéenne. En bouche la céréale occupe une place de premier plan. Presque sûre, celle-ci est savoureuse et subit clairement une lente transformation chimique. Le tout demeure plutôt sec, floral et bien long en bouche. Une épice marque la finale alors que sestompe les froides levures. Très heureux de goûter cette canette qui me parvient de loin.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
