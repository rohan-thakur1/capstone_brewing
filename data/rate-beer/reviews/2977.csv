2977,"2012-04-08",2.6,"(Draught)  Pours a clear orange body with a spare white head.  Aroma of pumpkin, grain, and caramel.  Flavor of corn, pumpkin, and caramel.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
2977,"2011-11-01",3.2,"On tap at Falling Rock. Pours with a lightly hazed copper hued body with minimal head. Aromas are sweet, malty, corn, spice and light DMS/vegital. Flavors are very sweet, fruity, estery, plum, corn and a bit of grainy/caramel maltiness (munich even?). Medium to low bubbles, thin.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
2977,"2011-10-28",2.8,"Orange pour with a spice and pumpkin aroma.  Spice flavor with pumpkin and some alcohol.  Decent for the style.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","alobar"
2977,"2011-10-26",2.8,"On tap at The Blue Tusk.  Very malt liquor with deep secondary pumpkin taste.  Not so great to drink, though taste is passable.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
2977,"2011-10-23",3.6,"On tap at Elysians Great Pumpkin Fest 2011. Colour... a truly orange colour with no head. Nose... corn sirop, malt sirop and  honey. Palate... plenty of corn up front  (which is what Id expect from a malt liquor) then a wave of sweet spice (nutmeg?) and clover honey followed by a grainy finish with hints of pumpkin and notes of ethanol. All in all not a bad ML.","Portland, Oregon, USA","neepsntatties"
2977,"2011-10-22",3.0,"Draft. Pours orange with a white head. Corny and pumpkiny aroma. The flavor has a bit of a grainy base with light pumpkin notes. Not bad.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
2977,"2011-10-21",3.4,"2011 Elysian GPBF #14. brilliant copper color/ ivory head. Corn syrup, cranberry, pumpkin meat, bready malt aromas. Rich, smooth mouthfeel. Nice mix of sweet pumpkin, corn syrup, berry fruit, bready pale malt flavors--not too bad.","Same Trailer, Different Park, Louisiana, USA","AmEricanbrew"
2977,"2011-10-20",3.1,"Elysian must be located right next to a pumpkin farm!  The aroma is corn, malt, fusels, and pumpkin, exactly like pumpkin thrown into a malt liquor.  The appearance is a clear orange, white head.  Heres where it gets interesting.  The flavor is bready, boozy, sweet pumpkin.  Medium in body, oily mouthfeel.  The finish is a burn form fusel alcohol, light noble hops. Not bad.  They definietly improved upon the standard malt liquor here.  Points for being interesting.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"
2977,"2011-10-14",3.3,"Draft @ Capitol Hill as part of the Pumpkin Fest leftovers; ymmmm, leftovers; comes all fancy and stuff in big stemmed glass; glowing orange, creamy white head with a nose full of spice, lemon, nutmeg, white sugar; creamy, sugary mouthfeel with a flavor profile closer to a sweet belgian spice beer than malt liquor; kind of hard to believe that this is actually the malt liquor base; in any event, its quite tasty overall and ticked down a bit for not really being a malt liquor ;)","Seattle, Washington, USA","SuzyGreenberg"
2977,"2011-10-13",2.9,"Tap @ Elysians Great Pumpkin Beer Fest...  Poured a pretty cool, vibrant, bright orange with a white head.  Looked great in the pumpkin snifter.  This beers just overly sweet and not much else.  Like liquid candy.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
2977,"2011-10-10",3.0,"2011 GBPF. Ha! This looks awesome! Food coloring gives it a proper pumpkin-orange color. Probably the most pumpkin looking beer at the festival. Smells and tastes slightly fruity and flat. Interesting. I could probably drink this from a 40.","Washington, USA","killjoy966"
2977,"2011-10-09",1.3,"Draft @ Falling Rock Elysian pumpkin fest. Wow--this is a really tough beer to rate because they pulled it off so well and yet its absolutely disgusting! I love love love their sense of humor and thats why overall score is way higher than it would be if this was not for trick-or-treat. Is red-orange (from the food coloring) and oily looking. Putrid plastic in the aroma is offensive, and to make it worse is a dollup of Crisco. This is serious crap, sort of a artificially sweetened candy character through and through. A putrid beer. Absolutely undrinkable.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
2977,"2011-10-07",2.7,"Draft at blunt tiger with streets. Pours a clear orange amber body with no head. Aroma is almost nonexistent - some light fruity notes and spice. Mouthfeel is thin with notes of lagery pumpkin spice and fruit","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
2977,"2011-10-04",0.6,"Reddish-amber colour.   Putrid aroma of alcohol and paint - theyve really captured the Indian malt liquor aroma here.  Tastes like a beer twice as strong.  Fruity, slick, gluey...hits all the wrong notes.  Humourously bad - reminiscent of 500ml cans of 12% subcontinental rocket fuel enjoyed behind a third world gas station outhouse.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
2977,"2011-10-03",3.6,"Draft at Falling Rock during the Pumpkin Event. I actually reall liked this one. No head, but pours a haunting orange. Nose is sweet and corny, faint flinty notes and then earthy pumpkin. On tasting, the sweetness of the beer really helps to bring out the pumpkin notes. Squash and corn dominate. Not a lot going on, but I liked it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
2977,"2008-12-17",3.4,"A rather generic adjunct laden malt liquor aroma with some pumpkin spice and vegetal notes. Fanta orange with an amazing orange cream head. Generic malt liquor flavors with light pumpkin vegetal notes and a touch of spice. Not as bad as one would think.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
2977,"2008-10-31",3.0,"Draft @ Elysian Tangletown.  Pours a brilliantly bright orange color; light orange head; looks kind of like orange soda.  Basic sugar and candy in the aroma; very light nose.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: chewy, viscous candy sugar, malty sweetness, oranges, and very light spicing; intense, slightly warming beer with lots of candy sugar, but definitely not bad at all.  A bit heavy.  Lengthy finish: some numbing mineral bitterness, candy sugar, and lots of sweetness and sugar.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
2977,"2008-10-22",2.4,"Taster - Elysian Tangletown - GPBF 2008 - Seattle, WA
Aroma  Light pumpkin aroma.  Very malty aroma also.  
Appearance  Orange in color, Clear with a nice head. Added Yellow Dye #6. 
Flavor  This was a malt liquor flavor with a very light pumpkin flavor lingering.   
Palate  Nice Mouthfeel, Good texture with a dry finish. 
Overall   This was  OK Malt Liquor but this beer missed the flavoring I was looking for.  Adding Yellow Dye #6 coloring are you kidding me? Sure the color was nice but this was scary to drink.","Olympia, Washington, USA","BrewDad"
2977,"2008-10-20",3.2,"Draft at Elysian Great Pumpkin Beer Fest (GPBF) 08. Absolutely neon bright orange. You could use this beer for a night light in your kid’s room. Loose creamy sherbet-colored rings of foam. Mild corny nose, not a lot of pumpkin there. Dry, somewhat acetic mid-palate. Corny, biscuity, and on the dry side.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2977,"2008-10-19",3.2,"Clear and remarkably orange in color (from the yellow 6 coloring I imagine), there’s a lot of sweet malt here as expected.","Seattle, Washington, USA","carruthm"
2977,"2008-10-04",3.5,"Tap at Blind Tiger.  Rich orange color with a thing white head.  Just enough pumpkin with an appropriate amount of sweetness.  Light malt and spiced character.  Definitely benefits from being consumed cold.  This was a pleasant surprise for me, I absolutely expected to not like this one.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","nhorween"
2977,"2008-10-03",3.4,"On tap at Blind Tiger.  I was both scared and intrigued to try this beer.  Pours a deep orange with a small white head.  Aroma of sweet malt and citrus (orange).  Flavor of light citrus fruit.  Somewhat drinkable but nothing special.  It was a long night, but I remember liking this...???","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LilBeerDoctor"
2977,"2008-10-03",3.0,"Draft at Blind Tiger, with Reuben & Jen, as part of their pumpkin Promo. 15 lines i believe.   All sampled as 5oz pours.  One of the worst of the night.  Pale malty beer with a hint of pumpkin, but mostly cheep corn.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
2977,"2008-10-02",3.3,"Tap at Blind Tiger. It kind of glows. A cheap-tasting beer with pumpkin. Some breadiness. I thought it was quite drinkable, albeit simple and surely no work of art.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
2977,"2008-10-01",2.5,"Tap at Blind Tiger.  Man... if ever there was a concept that didn’t need conceiving, this is it.  Clear orange-amber beer with a creamy white head.  Aroma is extremely appley and cidery.  Reminds me of an extra fresh Colt 45.  I can still recall drinking the original version of this beer and that concoctions signature is all over this beer.  Sticky sweet with notes of corn and pumpkin.  Stanky cluster hops.  As the beer warms, the pumpkiny flavour picks up quite a bit along with the higher fusely alcohols.  Tastes just like I imagined it would.  Fairly boozy on the back.  It’s still substantially better than the original... but that ain’t saying much.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
