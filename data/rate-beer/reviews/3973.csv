3973,"2017-03-01",4.2,"Jet black pour with a single finger espresso head with lace. Aroma is fruity with a hint of citrus. Full bodied and very flavorful. Finish is dry, roasted malt and pine. Slightly honeyed biscuit notes creep in. Tons of flavor going on here. This is not just a dark beer with a bunch of hops. A very well thought out black IPA.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","dinkle50"
3973,"2017-02-21",4.4,"650ml bottle shared with Ky from ck1, thx bro! Almost black pour with a beige head. Aroma has sweet and black malts, citrus and honey and perhaps chocolate. Taste is of well blended sweet malts, honey and citrus, with a touch of tangy black malts. Well done and well blended. Finishes the way a black ipa should; hoppy bittersweet. This is excellent; not Self-Righteous, but different and very well done in its way. 17","Wisconsin, USA","AWISLguy"

3973,"2015-04-14",3.9,"Location: Bottle shared at Max and AndyÂ’s Tasting, 2/28/15


Aroma: It has a nice hoppy aroma, resiny, pine, and lightly sweet/roast as well

Appearance: Brown in color, with a small head on it, and some fairly heavy lace

Flavor: Hops over malts flavor wise, similar to the nose from a component perspective

Palate: This one has a nice, smooth, mouthfeel, with a dry finish

Overall Impression:
Pretty solid one overall. Definitely leans toward the hoppy side for the style, which works quite nicely","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

3973,"2015-02-20",3.8,"Bottle: Near opaque with nice beige head and good lace. Resiny, dank, tropical and herbal hops marry with roasted nuts, mocha java, and dark breads to create a nice darkened DIPA. The mouth feel is somewhat aggressive but not overly so, a tad ashy and sticky too. I do prefer my Black a but less sweet and a bit more roasty but this will easily do in a pinch. I would drink it again.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
