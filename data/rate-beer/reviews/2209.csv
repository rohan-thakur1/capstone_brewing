Aroma is very sugary. Heavy raisin/prune component. A touch of plastic/phenols but that may be due to an Oktoberfest being consumed in January. 

The flavor is very sweet and sugary, but with a bitter-cherry end. There is a surprising hop that adds a nice, mild woody complexion. 

A creamy, chewy finish. Its a good, malt-forward ""change of pace"" beer among the hop bombs and sours you tend to see. The sugary aspects of it are well-balanced to prevent it from being a malt bomb.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

2209,"2016-12-06",3.6,"Sample sent for review, notes from September 2016. My pour presents a deep amber body with a very stiff and persistent white head. There is a big amber malt smell to it, and the usual boatload of hops, definitely a Pacific Northwest with its citrusy and piny note, theres also some Northern Brewer which gives it the rough hop smell and taste of a California common lager. Theres a full bodied crystal or Vienna malt presence that remains in conflict with the excess hops, as you would expect from a West Coast brewer. Despite that, and its 7.5% abv, it can go down pretty quickly.
As with the Surly Fest I sampled last weekend, this is another American beer that takes the basic concept of an Oktoberfest beer and runs wild with it. You can finish up your Oktoberfest celebratory evenings with this, but youll surely want to lay down a base of more traditional beers in the style to start and make this kind of the desert.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

Nice lacing. Nose has traditional Oktoberfest/marzen malty caramel notes but incorporates more hops than others. Reinforces the fact this is coming from Lagunitas. Taste has a nice bite with a piney quality but the predominant flavor is coming from a malty caramel/toffee characteristic.

All of this I expected but I did not expect the odd unfinished wortiness and harsh, weird woody bitterness. Lagunitas is normally pretty solid on their too sweet hoppy beers but this is an exception. It is kind of a tour de force of out-of-place dank, hoppy grossness and residual sugars being where actual malt character should be.

I guess thats the nature of the beast with a hoppy beer of this style. Flavors are somewhat muddled and nothing really descript-bright hops, mushy malts, seems unbalanced and a tad on the sweet side. Maybe a hint of alcohol as well. Finish is sweet malty with lingering notes of toasted grains, citric hops and some faint cereal. An ok beer but definitely doesnt go all that well in terms of being a hoppy lager.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
2209,"2016-10-01",4.1,"Brewed in the vein of Surlys SurlyFest, Tuberfest brings American hops to an old German style. I like the results because, well, I cant even help it. This beer has a copper hue and long-lasting head plus an impressive amount of lacing. Definitely a hop-forward aroma with earthy, woodsy, and spicy notes. The pungent nose creates a different expectation for the flavor. The taste is actually quite balanced. Brown sugar, toffee, light chocolate, nuts, and toasted bread for the malt profile. Herbaceous and moderately bitter hops toward the end. Yes, its the hoppy approach youd expect from a Lagunitas brew, but the complexity is remarkable. Despite the current trend of adding more botanicals to any style you can name theres really nothing else out there thats like this.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

2209,"2016-09-29",4.1,"DATE: September 29, 2016... OCCASION: Thirsty Thursday again... GLASSWARE: crystal mug... dark amber, almost brown orange body with some turbulent bubbles rising... a two-finger white head sits strongly before thinning to a creamy, swirling head... first scents of rosewood, coriander, lemon, and a mega-powerful load of caramel... a medium-bodied sip that tickles the teeth and resounds at the throat... for 7.5%, an unbelievably agreeable lager whose consistency begs for immediate consumption... flavor is as promised, with the caramel and flowery wood empowering the pleasant experience... an Oktoberfest that is hopped up on the kinds of flavors that suggest an IPA... some phenolic alcohol hints, but the majority of flavor is sweet, robust and powerful... overall, what does one expect from Lagunitas? A hoppy approximation of what a fest might be, but wow, this is a beer that transcends genre... better if consumed while sitting for the evening...","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"
2209,"2016-09-29",3.7,"Poured into a mug, the appearance was a ruddy dark orange somewhat leaning to hazy brown. Nice transparency. Thin white foamy lacing clings nicely all around the glass.
The aroma starts off with some sweet to bitter earthy, herbal, grassy, and piney hops. Oktoberfest levels of pure nutty/caramel/toffee sweetness slides in with enough balance to make sure the drinker knows that this is an Oktoberfest beer.
The flavor leans a balanced hoppy to malty sweet. Malty rich nutty and toffee/caramel aftertaste leads into a quick sweet finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionable smooth feel to it. Low carbonation. Acceptable semi-stickiness.

Very hoppy flavor , pine, minty pine, and refined hops. Oktoberfest underneath of an imperial caliber. I wouldnt say cedary as much as I would say it has that vanilla/coconut oaky presence. Lagunitas are great composers of hops and creating the best of beers just like masters like Stone Brewing. Very consistant great beers, kings of beers. Whats cooler is a six pack isnt priced its worth, but they and we know its worth more, theyre just not dicks. They can do that being the best of the best though, and they are.","Iowa, USA","jmohno"

The toasted malt takes the forefront though. Maybe a hint of floral and herbal hops. The flavor is bready and toasted up front followed by significant fruity hops. Grape, berries and pineapple stand out. Its pretty full bodied, but feels reasonably drinkable on the palate due to the toasted malt and lightly floral bitter finish. Overall, Im digging this beer way more than I thought I would. It comes across as more of a decent hoppy amber ale or even a hoppy bock. Oktoberfest seems like a stretch.

This is a weird one for me because of expectations, I got sticky, gritty, sweet, a little burnt, and very dry at the end. I didnt get the signature Lagunitas hops I was expecting, but I didnt get anything close to an Oktoberfest either.

Nice golden brown color. Aroma of caramel and hops. Light body, decent mouthfeel. The style you might expect, octoberfest marzen, is not what you get here (this is the case with other Lagunitas products as well), but taken as a unique brew this one is OK. Flavor is a bit of a mish-mash of caramel, pine, grain and some stewed vegetable like broccoli. Not unpleasant and not sweet with a mildly bitter aftertaste. Its easy drinking, but Im glad I bought one and not a sixer.","Massachusetts, USA","migwell"
