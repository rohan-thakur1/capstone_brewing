2266,"2015-04-03",4.1,"Az ""extra"" jelző ez esetben kivételes tartalmat sejtet, azt pedig már a kitöltést követően megállapíthatjuk, mennyire lenyűgöző teremtmény ez a trappista remekmű. Eszpresszó habjánál krémesebb dolog kevés létezik, puha paplanként terül szét a gesztenyeszínű testen. Szinte unalomig ismert az élmények körvonala, parfümös intenzitással előtörő rágógumis, selyemcukros, elegáns karakterű élesztőtől fűtött aromáival mégis lehetetlenség betelni, miután mindegyik legendás palack másféle stílusban adja elő a cifra mondanivalót. Megnyugvást áraszt minden egyes molekulája, a végletekig kifinomult illatokhoz kevesen tudnának felzárkózni ízben, a főzet azonban lenyűgöző természetességgel vesz minden akadályt. Könnyed és légies kortyai súlyos tartalommal telítettek, a jó öreg aszalványok, a mézcseppekkel gazdagított fanyar élesztő harsogó képe, a nemes és érett, száraz alkoholok jegyei maradandó kombinációja által pillanatok alatt egy autentikus belga söröspince atmoszféráját szimatolhatjuk meg; nem valószínű, hogy jelentős számú vetélytársa akad a kategórián belül.","HUNGARY","adster"

Aroma: that cool sweet malty smell, yeast, a bit bready

Appearance: Pours around 30 on SRM scale. Deep brown without being super dark or opaque. Very active head and carbonation leaves foamy cap, lacing.

Taste: Wow. Toffee, dark fruits, sweet, plum. Cinnamon or brown sugar. For me: everything good about Achel 8 bruin, tone down the fruits and sweetness a bit to make it a bit better balanced (though I really like Achel 8 bruin) and add some brown sugar or cinnamon like flavor. Yummy. Recently had a Widmer Brothers Kill Devil Brown Ale 13 and its kind of similar to that but executed better. Man this is tasty, as expected. I am pretty much slamming this.

Palate/Mouthfeel: somewhat creamy if only due to foam head. Otherwise fairly light. Flavor on the tongue then pretty much gone just like that. Leaves some nice sweetness in the throat. 

Overall: delicious. Will buy again.

2266,"2013-04-14",5.0,"Bouteille de 75 cl simplement capsulée (et non bouchonnée) : très curieux pour ce 
niveau de bière, puisque nous sommes avec une brune supérieure de 9,5 % abv.
Cette bière est ainsi une quadruple non bouchonnée... Imaginons cela avec la Chimay bleue !!!
Mon exemplaire était à date en fin 2011, et la bière est complètement plate au versage.
La couleur est passée au brun roux du porto tawny, ce qui nest pas du meilleur effet mais on
peut comprendre.
Clarté nette. Bulles et mousse inexistantes.
Arômes de pruneau, malt, figue, poires cuites.
1ère bouche où on est parti sur le porto, il ny avait donc pas que la couleur !!
Puis on a vraiment la traduction ici de lexpression « pain liquide », on a un mélange malté
fort qui rend compte des céréales. Cest aussi pour moi un vrai « barley wine » parce que
limpression du vin plat est bien là, et il sagit donc bien dun vin dorge 
2ème bouche sur le pruneau, les fruits mûrs, le candi et une légère pointe de moka.
3ème bouche complète, avec une toute légère nuance de fraise mûre des variétés non sucrées.
Arrière-bouche pleine sur le malt et la levure, et une pointe de tourbe.
La longueur montre ce quest une madérisation pure, parfaite, jusquà la teinte tirant sur la
brique, avec en conséquence bien sûr une ampleur des saveurs.
La levure est intègre, un pur terreau...
Lalcool sest développé avec le temps, et tape sévèrement en début de dégustation. 
Il convient donc dinstaller cette dégustation dans le calme pour savourer pleinement ce
pur produit des forges de Vulcain... surtout sil est âgé.
La finale se laisse savourer car elle est complexe avec du bois, des fruits, du malt, de la 
levure et bien dautres choses qui relèvent du barley wine.
Une bière qui vous fait pénétrer dans les liens entre le vin et la bière, ce qui est un programme
fabuleux qui a lui seul mérite un très high score...
A déguster donc jeune pour le plaisir et âgée pour lérudition....","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

Pours a hazy brown color with a good tight head and nice lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is nutty and rich. The level of spice is moderate and is limited to darker richer spice characters like anise and cinnamon. Some sweet plum aromas are evident. 

The flavor is rich with some mild toffee with lots of nuttiness. The beer is plenty sweet and a tad bit boozy. Some dark fruit is present but not nearly as pronounced as perhaps I had expected. 

I loved this beer and would have written much more, but a Flemish gentleman who hardly spoke English was sitting at the table next to me and kept trying to get me to trade beers with him. He apparently really liked Achel. I decided to be social rather than hand scralling a whole bunch of notes about plum cake and burnt sugar. boo hoo.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

2266,"2011-04-21",3.7,"Bottled shared with Amyliz4. Served in a Mikasa goblet.

Pours a brownish-red color with a good off-white head and quite a bit of initial lacing. The head is fairly stable with pretty good retention. Eventually this falls into a thin collar and a cap comprised of a few bubbles. The nose is really nice and sweet at cellar temperature with plenty of dark fruits, toffee, and some dates. Caramel-like sweetness abounds.

The flavor is a bit more mellow and subdued. There is a bit of bitterness and the sweetness isnt nearly as strong. There are some dark fruits and a bit of a toffee presence, but not like what I was finding in the nose. Not nearly as complex, but still quite good. Bitterness is a bit out of place. Slight bitterness mixing with the alcohol is a bit strange, but I can work with it. Low carbonation and a medium body. Overall, a pretty tasty beer and Im glad to finally try a bottle of this.

2266,"2011-03-06",3.9,"750ml capped bottle, best by April 2009.  Lets see how this holds up 2 years after the best by date and being on a store shelf almost the entire time.  Pours murky reddish-brown with a short-lived one finger tan head leaving a few spots of lacing and holding not much more than a ring.  Aroma is smooth dark fruits, raisins, plums, figs, Belgian candi sugar, bread and yeast, like jam-slathered toasted bread.  Good strength.  Flavor is more dark fruits, raisins, red grapes, plums, figs, candi/brown sugar, rather sweet, very smooth, no alcohol noticed.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, low carbonation.

2266,"2011-02-21",4.1,"750ml green capped bottle.

Pours into my tulip with a fizzy, billowing slightly off-white head. The beer is a hazy brown/amber/reddish brown.

The yeast is very powerful n the scent with hints of lemon. There is also some dark fruit scents like red grape, raisin, and prune. And also some hints of dark malts and caramel.

The taste is actually very similar to the smell. It is more astringent than most Belgian strong darks. There are a bit more spices in the flavor and I am definitely picking up some cinnamon-like character. It has just a bit of tartness which is welcome for this style. After the sediment is poured the tartness vanishes and loads of caramel and yeast goodness come to the forefront. It is one damn complex brew.

The mouthfeel is a bit too carbonated, that is the only real flaw of this beer.

Overall it is a great Trappist beer, I expected better but this is pretty good.

A - Dark and cloudy mahogany and chestnut brown with a bit of a dark red hue and a good amount of yeast floating. Smaller than average tight, foamy head that settles pretty fast into a thin foamy lace that concentrates on one side.

S - Burnt brown sugar and molasses along with some caramel malt sweetness. Some dark and dried fruit covering all kinds of dark fruit. Some earthy, nutty and cocoa aroma comes out in the background. Some spices and yeast present, but not overly strong.

T - Similar to the nose. Strong burnt brown sugar and molasses sweetness along with some caramel malt. Dark fruit was present, but not dominant, or all that strong given the style. Mid sip brings some earthy and herbal bitterness along with a good amount of nutty and earthy flavors. Also touches of cocoa in the background.

I tried this beer on September 24, 2009 at ""The beerbistro"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The beer poured out a murky brown colour with reddish hues and a thin white head.  The aroma was malt, yeast, and plenty of dark fruit tones like plums.  The mouthful was fulkl-bodied with medium carbonation.  The flavour was plums and licorice with a hint of hoppy bitterness.  An excellent beer.","Milton, Ontario, CANADA","cyrenaica"

Aroma is a nice combination of sweet and sour notes: ripe berries (raspberries, blueberries), malt, dark fruits (raisins, prunes), blackcurrant and toffee. Flavour goes along similar lines although the sweetness is kept well in check by the more bitter notes as well as the addition of some subtle vinous notes into the mix.

Candi sugar upfront makes way for so many different fruity and malty elements theyre hard to fully put into words. Every sip its something different.

Very elegant aroma- soft Belgian yeast with some musty phenols- some cocoa, rich yet soft toffee from dark Belgian malts and a touch of dates. Fluffy carbonation covers a slick and warming body. The flavor gives off some cocoa and date sweetness- however, its soft and not astringent like some Quads. It does have some warming alcohol (only in the feel, not the flavor) Perhaps some raisin and fig with a gritty dark malt note on the back.

Foam began oozing out of the bottle before I could even fully remove the cap; apparently the initial carbonation is frequently substantial with this beer, though.  Fruity, sweet aroma, malty and liberally dosed with yeast, displaying hints of milky, creamy chocolate, red grape, earth, coriander, hazelnut, spice, faint berry and some dusty cobwebs in the background.  Dark brown in color, quite hazy and sedimented, with a lasting, pale tan head and a fine pattern of lace behind it.  Flavor is abundantly sugary and sweet, dark caramel and toffee can be found throughout, along with the less forceful characters of red wine, clove and cocoa, finishing with a blend of peppery alcohol, fruity tartness, mild bitterness, old wood, licorice and tobacco.  Smooth yet active and lightly acidic and warming on the palate, body is richly full.  Aged a bit longer than intended, perhaps, but retains plenty of intrigue and depth, it appears.

Deep brown, brief head. Dark bruney aroma - its got the roasted malts, some plums, a general sweetness, a touch of yeast, but also some gluey esters which spoilt the aroma for me. Fairly pleasant mouthfeel, but a little alcoholic. Again, the brune components are all there in the taste, but the alcohol sticks out just a little too much.

2266,"2008-09-24",4.2,"It’s not often I’d call a beer in the 99th percentile ""under-rated"", but if any fit the bill it’s this spectacular Belgian quad. Every beer I’ve had from this brewery has been sensational and this is no exception. It’s a mystery to me why the brewer isn’t held in higher regard. Appearance: burnished copper with a shallow scattering of suds. It’s not the best-looking quad but age may have wearied this sample, which I’ve held for a few years now. Aroma: rich, sweet and vinous. American taffy, cough medicine, Parma Violets, grape bubblegum, crushed blackcurrants, sweet sherry - it’s one of those complex beasts that keeps throwing up new comparators. There are loads of residual sugars but no hint of the 9.5% abv. Palate: medium-bodied and creamy-smooth. Perfection. Flavour: grape juice, treacle, turpentine woody notes, port, cough syrup and lots of demorara sugar. It’s very briefly light and fruity at the front of the palate before a big spicy, warming finish. It’s ""hot"" but more restrained than that big abv might suggest. Overall: a complex, beautifully integrated quad.

Color is a deep hazy amber with low carbonation and a nice tight head.  Taste is candy sweet and rich.  Starting with a bold medium body it goes down rich and fizzy.  Finish comes out with a sweet, faintly roasted malt taste with a sugary caramel back tone.  After taste is a slight fruity yeast flavor that gives way quickly to an alcohol feel.  Another great Authentic Trappist Ale.  This one is a bit sweeter then most and the Belgian yeast doesn’t stand out as much, but it is very complex and amazingly tasty.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","RSRIZZO"

Pours an ominously dark brownish black with a very viscous appearance on its way out of the bottle and into the glass.  hugely sweet and fruity aroma with loads of biscuity, chocolatey malts... some toffee, caramel, brown sugar, the works.  Flavors were a very ""concise"" in terms of expressing the traditional Trappist Quadrupel qualities:  all of the sweet maltiness and sugariness you would expect, a whole complex of fruity esters gives this particular brew its own qualities.  A bit of alcohol but a very gentle and pleasant amount.  Palate was very rich, soft, sugary, a bit sticky... with a nicely crisp and tidy finish.  Perhaps a bit of the bitterness from the hops was evident in the finish.  A nice full, lasting carbonation that creates a perfect bubbly softness on the tongue.

The flavor found berries, vinous notes, and a fuller, rich caramelization..  dry peppery spices with warm sherry on the finish.  Medium-plus bodied with creamier carbonation on the edges, but it felt a bit light on the middle.. alcohol was well masked and the warmth at the finish was rock solid.

2266,"2008-05-22",3.7,"Explosive pour. Probably because I had to lay it on its side to chill in the fridge, luckily my Chimay chalice was handy. Murky brown in the glass. Aroma of Belgian yeast and purple grapes. Flavor of purple grapes (tons of grape here) and some lighter fruits with a nice dancing palate. If theres a fresh hop bitterness, Im not getting it at cellar temperature. At 18 bucks I wanted to be amazed and Im getting alot to like here, but amazing is not a word that comes to mind. 9.5% alcohol content is only mildly apparent, but it doesnt hide it as well as the LaTrappe, Roche, or Chimay, probably due to a lack of deep malt character. Whoa, just called a friend to let him know I was drinking what he wasnt and there it was, a zest of hops, about 3 minutes after my last drink. Warning: for those of you that like to leave the flavor crystals in the bottle, theres a massive amount of sediment. Im near the end of my review, so my glass looks like a lava lamp. Love it!

Very similar to Oerbier Reserva but much lighter in character at 9.5% compared to 13%. The thing that keeps this beer tasting fantastic throughout the colossal bottle is the magical carbonation.

The flavor is very complex, sweetness, yeast, pear, peach, banana, spice, grass, honey, and caramel.  A yeast pour and warming really pump up the characteristics.  It becomes much more of a heady sensation.  There is some faint trace of floral hops that along with the yeast characteristics tries to balance out the sweet notes.

Its caramel sweet; it has fruit thats neither dark nor light (maybe this is the ""dried fruit""). Theres a coffee or cacao undertone, I think. It is almost silky smooth.

With plums, figs, raisins, dark sugar, cinnamon, slight spicyness from the hops - great complexity. The taste was fruity and spicy upfront, and finished more dry with strong malty notes of vanilla and dark fruit, reminiscent of old tawny port. The balance was a bit off, with the sweet fruityness dominating. It also lacked a really distinctive character, like Rocheforts unique yeasty spicyness or St. Bernadus rounded malt-profile - or Westvleterens outstanding balance.

Many flavors come out over the course of this experience - caramel, chocolate and toffee at first.  Next there was a sour cherry taste.  Lastly a subtle fruity taste.  Finally, it ends with a taste not unlike a toned down Belgian Red.  Excellent aftertaste contains mixtures of all of the above.

2266,"2006-01-14",3.9,"Best by date of April 2008, Sampled January 2006
This beer sits a hazy, amber brown color in my tulip.  The beer is quite well carbonated and is topped by a frothy, three-finger thick, tan colored head that leaves lacing on the side of the glass as it slowly subsides in a cacophonous mix of large through small bubble.  The aroma is quite concentrated with sweet fruity notes reminiscent of figs, sweet plums, raisins and even prunes.  There is also a healthy, bready, yeasty note here, as well as some notes of clove.  The aroma is quite rich and sweet, but without being heavy.  After a bit of time a note of alcohol becomes evident as well.

The taste has that same sweet, fruity character to it, and the body while hefty is perhaps not as rich as I was expecting.  It is still palate coating enough to make this a satiating, slow sipping evening as I work my way through this 750ml bottle.  It is definitely quite well carbonated as the beer foams up on the tongue, it is not quite as noticeable as in a lighter beer, but it certainly helps to lighten the body of this beer.

Actually at this point I think I would like it to be a bit less carbonated, so I spend the time to make it so.  The beer softens out, and becomes even smoother than it was before.  The sweetness is a bit accentuated as well, which tends to magnify the fruit notes of sweet plums and figs.  In the end this beer does not quite seem rich enough, though in its defense it is at the perfect level for me to be able to finish a 750ml in an evening.  The finish has a light sharpness to it (a mix of carbonation, alcohol, and a bit of spicy yeast character), plus a phenolic note of clove.

This is definitely a beer I am happy to have a 750ml bottle of, allows for a quite evening; it is contemplative when I want it to be, and light enough to just add to the experience if I happen to be distracted by a book.  Definitely a good beer, one which even grows on me over time; it almost becomes greater than the sum of its parts.

This is a beer Ive had several times now. I have been impressed each time but this particular rating comes from a bottle that I aged for 8 months. 

Pours a darker amber body but highlights of  gold shining along the glasses edges. There has always been only a slight head on this beer; it dissipates rather quickly. The aroma is impressive! Intense pit fruits accompanying brown sugar. The flavor backs that aroma with a more intense bravado! Sweet malty offerings of plums, dates, raisins, figs and pear; there are dryer suggestions in the finish of pressed apple with the light yeasty bitterness. The palate is full and sticky oily yet only lightly syrupy. This is SO far unlike any other Trappist beer I have ever had! It is especially elegant. I envision myself after a formal dinner party playing backgammon in a leather-floored study, wearing a velvet smoking jacket and sipping this nearly room temperature beer from a crystal snifter, as I puff an elusive Cuban stogy. Beers like this are what provoke my dreams.","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

Good amount of caramel.  Flavor is full of caramel, toffee, perfectly balanced yeastiness (banana, light angel food cake, vanilla frosting, sugar cookie dough) and a hint of alcohol.

Achel is learning how to brew. What kept the 8 Brune from being a sensational beer was that the intense fruitiness was not balanced by any dark maltiness whatsoever. With the Extra, this is surely not the case. It was soft and very mellow. Dark fruits, mainly cherry and plum were present but were balanced so well by a deep maltiness of chocolate, caramel and cookie. I am expecting some incredible things from Achel in the future............................................ July 2005.  Achel has really improved, turning this into an undeniably world class beer.

Full and smooth in the mouth, my taste buds were pleased even when neglecting the flavor.  However, the flavor didn't hurt anything either.  Buttery chocolate and sweet fruit seem to dominate in the mouth.  Perhaps some melted caramel, a touch of hops, and more banana and bubblegum also become noticeable.  Much more satisfying and flavorful than the blond.   This was truly a joy to drink along side some smooth, buttery, stinky Wisconsin Trappist cheese.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

Dark fruit, berry, yeast, plum, chocolate, caramel, nutty, toffee, medium to full bodied, finishing with a spicy, yeast, alcohol bite.  Very drinkable, this is one of my new favorites.","Amherst, Massachusetts, USA","Hopistotle420"
2266,"2003-10-04",4.0,"[Bottled, labelled Achel Extra] The aroma is very sweet with notes of dried berries and yeast. The color is brown an it has an off white head. The flavor is very sweet (no wonder considering the 9.5% ABV) and complex with notes of black currants, yeast, plums, and raisins. A really good flavor. The best Achel I've had - too bad it is so hard to come by.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
2266,"2003-09-20",3.4,"Bottled, labelled Achel Extra. Orange brown with coarse, livley head. Sweet sugary aroma. Medium bodied with notes of chocolate, toffee, roasty licorice and vodka. Very powerful, but still a bit raw, and some time to mature will make it better.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
2266,"2003-08-31",3.8,"Former X-mas ale, now produced year-round under the name of ""Extra"".
Dark chestnut colour with amber shine. Thick yellowish head, collapsing, lacey.
Nose of dark roasted malts, chocolate (fondant), pecan nuts, slight oxidation. Sweet taste, chocolatey, nutty. More hops retronasal. A bit oily mouthfeel (walnut oil), some carbondioxide stimulation. Nice rich beer, could do with a good dose of American hops. But it is well-worth looking for all the same, whether as X-mas or Extra.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
2266,"2002-12-22",3.2,"From tap. Slightly cloudy amber coloured beer with a small head. Hop, soap and alcohol aroma. Malty taste with obvious alcohol taste. Not disturbing though. Bitter dry alcohol finish.","Mol, BELGIUM","Kåstå"
2266,"2002-12-04",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2006 From tap at Café De Engel Oldenzaal. Beer of the Month in december 2002. Cloudy and very young with a buttery aroma. Flavor abundant with hops and licorice. Some butter in the flavor, that gets stronger while the beer is warming up. Lacks some complexity, but that will get better as the beer ages.
Bottle, sold as Achel Extra Bruin. Malt, raisin, cake dough and caramel in the aroma. Malty sweet flavor with raisin, porto and roasted malt. Hint of cinnamon. Velvety and not without complexity. Warming alcohol. Very well balanced, this powerful trappist ale.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
