Malty, breast and rather hoppy aroma with caramel and slightly spicy and bready notes. Quite sweet with bready rye flavours with hoppy notes and a decent bitterness. Tasty, but a bit too much caramel for my taste.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","visionthing"

Hop dominated flavor with grassy hops, berries, harpix and heather. Has a slick and silky mouth feel, and a heavy bitterness. A tasteful and aromatic beer, but the bitterness is maybe too dominating.","Bodø, NORWAY","Foffern"

2395,"2014-08-16",3.7,"Wow! Glorious red colour of Brazilwood, with a respectable off-white head. Aromas of biscuits, caramels and a touch of grapefruit/hops. Flavours of biscuits, flan, piney veins in there, with that resinous mouthfeel, plus the very well-behaved bitter touch from the grapefruits  the red ones! Pretty simple, straightforward. Good beer!","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"
2395,"2014-03-30",3.2,"Bottle from Mane Liquor. Pours clear amber with a small beige head. Nose is huge biscuit and resin with some spicy caramel. Comes out a little one dimensional. Taste showcases rye nicely but it doesnt have any finesse about it. A little rough around the edges with some grass and biscuit.

2395,"2014-02-14",3.7,"Murky red. Aroma is spicy quality, yet mild. Taste is classic garage project - original yet balanced; spicy rye session red not relying on hops or bitterness to drive it. Very cool. Palate is perfect - full and lovely spice. Overall, maybe the best non-hoppy red Ive had.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","stoutnick"

2395,"2014-01-18",3.8,"First and foremost, this beer passed the very important would I fancy another pint test with flying colours and my endorsement saw everyone in my party buy and pint and make affirmative and appreciate mutterings about this beer. Lovely blushes of red mahogany in the pint with a good collar of cream coloured head. The aroma was of rustic amber, resins and spruce needles. This was manifest in the flavour with a decent punch of bitterness that strung out the finish. I had a hankering at that stage for a good resinous hoppy beer and this delivered in spadefuls. I look forward warmly to the next.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
2395,"2013-08-16",3.9,"This is a crackingly good beer. It looks stunning in the glass, it has a fair crack of bitter that is balanced by a goodly amount of sweet and it carries itself through the whole thing very well. 

IF I was being picky Id suggest that this might be overly carbonated, but lets not quibble, and if this was the only thing left and the Red Rocks or Pernicous weed had sold out I still be grinning and think Id scored.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","Pdubyah"

2395,"2013-06-19",4.2,"Aroma carries a green hoppiness reminiscent of their Pernicious Weed sitting on a bed of caramel malt. Taste is the same with typical rye spiciness. A delicious beer, the aroma lasts till the end and the glass is beautifully laced from top to bottom. Nothing stodgy or old-fashioned, no bullshit claims to some pseudo-historical accuracy, just a fresh bottle of no nonsense goodness.","North Shore, Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","DylansDad"
