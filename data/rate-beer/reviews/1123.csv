1123,"2017-06-19",4.3,"Bottle at Moeder, split with the wife. Pours a bright ruby red, pink/fuchsia hues. Lively eggshell head fades to virtually nothing....but can be revived with a swirl. Aromas of grape skin, hay, musty basement, light floral/earth note, light cranberry., light oak. All nicely balanced, but none overwhelming. Taste is a tiny bit more muted than the Zwanze 2011. Very similar, but not as much depth on the nose. Tiny cherry skin, grape juice, medium mouth feel, a bit oily, some light oak tannin with lightly floral hop presence....again, a bit more balance, but not the rollercoaster of flavor that Zwanze 2011 gave me. A fantastic blend that still stands as a favorite from this trip!","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"

1123,"2016-12-29",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed at Cantillon on November 10. 750 mL bottle shared with Kathleen. The pour is a nice coppery golden orange color with a thick white head and some good, soapy lace as it falls down. The aroma is definitely peppery and lovely. There is a nice zingy barnyard going on, and a great tart and spicy grape skin. This is just balanced and well done. Tart and sour with just enough pepper and funk. The flavor is much of the same. The pepper lightens up a bit, letting the funky grape skin shine through with the barnyard funk. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a great carbonation and a lingeringly peppery grape must on the finish. This is surprisingly good, but Im not crazy about the pepper.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Lovely aroma, very estery as expected with funkiness but both remaining very elegant without overdoing it, hints of sweet grape as well as wry grape peel, hint of green tomato, sherry vinegar, green plums, lime, yellow raspberries, raw celery somewhere, damp hay, sweat fitting in perfectly. Estery onset, big fruitiness with gooseberry, yellow plum and redcurrant impressions drenched in sweetish grape flavors, lemony sourness cutting through but not overly puckering, lambrusco-like soft fizziness, dry and tart with fruitiness and sourness continuing over a soft bready backbone with a light soapy wheat accent, long drying yoghurty lactic tartness throughout, touch grape pit and wood tannins in the end adding further drought, complex with the perfect degree of funkiness.

1123,"2016-05-10",4.5,"Pours a bright red color, with a small foamy head, which sticks to the rim of the glass the whole time.

Smells of fruity, ripe red grapes, with a spicy, black peppery note among dust and scented wood. Offers a faint note of caraway, blueberries and wet hay with a decent citrus zest peak.

Has a nice softness underneath the mellow grape appearance, establishing a very well balanced, smooth drinking beer. A decent amount of bubbly, slightly mineralic carbonation is able to cut through, perfectly enhanced by mold covered lime zest.

The beer produces a grape entangled nutmeg qualitly, together with dried black and red peppers and a soft, crisp tartness. Wet hay and blueberry straw add to the still mellow complexity of the grapes, while a more pungent acidity comes up. This lets the grapes appear younger, more unripe, while a wooden, dried earth maltiness adds a moldy, sweet note to the grapes, instantly blending into its fruitier components. 

Cantillon at its best, this is so easy to drink, since every single flavour adds to the sublime balance in this, while at the same time you are able to pick up a different flavor after each and every sip. Very soft on the tongue with a perfect amount of tartness on the back end, this highlights to grape appearance awesomely well, which still does not grow overly pungent like in their Zélige.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Couleur fine rosée-presque léger ambré, col fin rosâtre.
Arôme offre un nez fruité qui reste nettement plus modéré que sur les autres versions dAunis, retrouve un marqué funk, boisé et lambic plus dominant.
Palais reste léger, musty, funk, grains - lambic le tout sur un profil fruité rouge étant plus discret. Personnellement, je la trouve en dessous de lAunis et de Carignan, le corps me semble plus léger avec un lambic plus dominant.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

The color on this beer is amazing, pink/orange light couloir. Beautiful. Wild strawberriey jam and dandelion stems. Gunpowder is also there in the nose. The taste is very tart and almost sweet in the beginning (although its dry but it taste sweet even tough it aint.) Prominent grape character, the beer tastes similarly to some orange nature wines Ive tried.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","Ludvig"
1123,"2016-05-04",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 5, 2016 Decanted at brewery. Quite special compared to older batches of Daunis. Much more sweetness and floral peppery berries followed by funk and sourness. Grape skins and berryish aroma. In my opinion it would benefit from more maturing in the bottle, or if you prefer its current flavor to drink it fresh. Still a beautiful, sessionable product that I can see myself grow to like.","SWEDEN","manker"

Pours and smells like a fresh, natural rosehip tea infusion complete with almond and cinnamon spice (grape pips, bretta?). Love the mouthfeel here, lovely staying power and even a touch of sweetness (!) at 6,5% - Cantillon out of character in this rosé wine of a young lambiek. Yoghurt-like, whey touches and berry peel throughout into the finish, a lively step before the trademark full-throttle dried lemon rind. Not the most complex, but very juicy.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

AROMA: Sweet red grape.

APPEARANCE: Cassis like, spritzy, medium head quickly dissapates to a small ring. A little lacing. Gorgeous red grape colour.

TASTE: Medium sour, red grape, a little oak. Almost like a Cassis. Delightful.

PALATE: Actually quite light bodied and fairly dry. 

OVERALL: A real pleasure and definitely world class. Marvellous.","Manchester, Lancashire, ENGLAND","Belgianloner"
1123,"2016-01-23",4.8,"Thank you PriorL! 750 ml. drank together with Mathieu87 & PriorL at Cantillon. Took notes only towards the end only because I didnt figure that this is a new beer. Bright amber dark pink, small of white pinkish head. Nose is big puckering fruit, red grape but also cassis, light raspberry, oak, lightly fizzy, fruit is big & carries a nice jam quality. Taste is jam fruits, puckering, thick jam, red grape, raspberry, cassis & grapefruit, thick jam with oak, mellow funk, sour but not extremely so, Faintly sparkling carbonation & jam-like fruit body. This is just delicious & surprisingly different from what I remember Pinot DAunis being & the different should be just no dry hopping. ABV is also higher here. This one thicker, jam-like fruits. Either way man this is delicious stuff as usual. With age looking at their other similar beers this should graduate from wonderful to astonishing. Beautiful as usual. I look forward to having this one again.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
