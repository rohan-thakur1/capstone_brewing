Pours golden wheat and hazy. Aroma is grainy, bready malts, with some floral and spicy hops, as well as a bit of a woody note. On the lighter bodied side, taste of bready malts, faint bitterness. Enjoyable.","New York, New York, USA","murphym45"
4288,"2010-08-06",3.7,"12 ounce bottle.  Although i am not to familiar with this style, So I am not sure what to look for or expect.  Aroma was a nice mix of biscuity malts and floral hops.  Floral hops seemed a little more noticeable in the flavor then the malts but both were prevalent.  Body had a slight viscosity to it.  A good beer.","New York, USA","crazyvin"

4288,"2010-06-13",3.3,"Comes out of the tap a hazy golden yellow with a typical snow white head. Aroma has a nice balance of malt and hops - neither dominates the other. Flavor is a little more hoppy than malty and only slightly bitter, and has fruity and woody undertones. Smooth, fairly fizzy texture leaves a woody finish.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"

4288,"2010-01-24",4.0,"BCTC 2009.  Solo cup sample while playing beer pong at the CL/SH/FF tent.  Pours a nice hazy golden with a massive fluffy head.  Aroma is bready, doughy yeast, light grass, floral and lightly spiced green hops.  Flavor is pils malt, fresh baked bread, super clean mineral character, with some grassy light floral and herbal hops- super fresh, and refreshing- awesomely drinkable.  Perfect beer pong beer.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
4288,"2009-11-25",3.9,"on tap at the Copper Mine pub.  Hazy blonde in color with a medium white head.  Aroma of bread, grain, light must (yeast) with a dash of noble hops.  Nice.  Taste is lightly grainy and malty, light honey sweetness - yeast in suspension keeps the body relatively smooth, a good amount of bready yeast, very light esters, maybe a very light touch of sulfur, with a lightly hoppy finish.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"

4288,"2009-05-27",3.0,"On tap at Bilnd Tiger.  The aroma is toasted malts, bread, basement aromas.  The appearance is a hazy reddish gold color, white head.  The flavor follows the aroma.  The finish has a bittering from hops, and a sourdough component.  Thin to medium mouthfeel.  Not bad overall.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"

4288,"2008-06-03",3.9,"Tap @ Blind Tiger....Pours a hazy yellow with a nice, thick white head.  Aroma is bread and cookie notes with a nice hop crispness included as well.  Taste is the same, with a wonderful hop bitterness, and a slight corn/biscuit aftertaste that really serves to make the beer clean and refreshing.  Well done, Southampton.  Well done.","North Bellmore, New York, USA","thenick"
4288,"2008-05-31",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2008 Tap at Blind Tiger for the Southampton event. Great cloudy yellow pour with a sudsy head. Tons of biscuit, with basil, sweetish cookie, earthy hops. Great body, super drinkable. Cant ask for much more in a session beer than this. Tastes a bit more British than German, though. Would probably be amazing on cask.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
