1311,"2017-05-09",3.9,"Bottle at The Bottle Lab, Leek. Pours a deep ruby brown colour with a medium tan head. Aroma of caramel, wood, dark fruits, chocolate, some smoke, peat, slight nuts, a little honey and subtle biscuit. Taste of caramel, dark fruits, wood, smoke/peat, some honey, slight chocolate, a little dried fruits, a hint of chilli and subtle biscuit. Medium to full bodied and soft carbonation. A bittersweet, dried fruit, smoky bitterness in the finish. Very complex, smoky but not overpowering and honeyed and fruity sweetness running throughout. So smooth too. Very good.","Stoke On Trent, Staffordshire, ENGLAND","Towey1989"
1311,"2017-04-23",3.3,"22nd April 2017Clear deep red - amber beer, good pale tan head. Palate is smooth with reasonable fine carbonation. Soft malts, sweetish, rich honey underneath. For me there is a little too much smoke which jars against the honey sweetness. Light floral sweetness and modest spicy dark fruits. Smooth semi dry finish. Interesting beer but the smoke is at a level that reduced drinkability.",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"
