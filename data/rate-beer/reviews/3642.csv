The head is an eggshell color, it builds and clings more than expected for such a high abv beer. The head is composed mostly of sherry like notes, caramel and oxidized bourbon. The taste is much the same with some vanilla, oak and milk chocolate added. The carbonation is much more pronounced than expected. Despite the carbonation its a pretty thick. Great beer, the whiskey flavors accentuate the old ale flavors and the few years of age on the bottle probably enhanced the sweet sherry like notes.

Overall, a really nice barrel aged old ale, up there with the best. Lots of malt character with hints of hops and oxidation. Balanced oak and bourbon. Could use a bit more carbonation perhaps.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge raisin, plum, fig, date, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, coconut, toasted oak, bourbon, light leather, and oak/toasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, date, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, coconut, toasted oak, bourbon, light leather, and oak/toasted earthiness.

Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light-moderate warmth lingering after the finish. Minimal booziness overall in aromas and flavors. Overall this is an absolutely incredible barrel aged old ale style. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. An insanely enjoyable and delicious offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
3642,"2015-07-01",4.3,"Take an excellent Old Ale and age it in bourbon barrel and youre probably going to end up with something great. Thats the premise of North Coast Old Stock 2013 Cellar Reserve, and the result is a delectable, sweet beastly brew thats remarkably drinkable. My only complaint is that its merely excellent rather than world class.

I poured a 500ml corked and cage bottle into a flared snifter (thanks to Patrick at the brewery for the bottle!).

Appearance: A hazy shade of murky burgundy to brown proper. Completely opaque. Pours to a small, off-white, soapy head which fizzles away quickly and completely.

Smell: Lovely scent of dark fruit, chocolate and bourbon though not especially pungent.

Taste: Theres a lot going on in this beer and its all pretty tasty to say the least. The base brew has a sweet, authentic palette of dark and dried fruits: plum, raisin, fig, cherry, dates, etc. But thats after the light milk chocolate sensation which opens each swig. On the finish the bourbon barrel appears to impart an earthy woody character, some vanilla and a hint of smoke. Alcohol grows stronger on each sip and becomes ever so slightly distracting. Theres an aftertaste of fruit and dark malt, though its only temporary. Hops have nearly completely receded  only the faintest bitterness is detectable. Overall, its what I would consider a great-tasting brew.

Drinkability: At 14.1% ABV, North Coast Old Stock 2013 Cellar Reserve is a big beer by anyones definition. Yet, its not quite the behemoth I was expecting. Yes, theres considerable warmth from the alcohol, but never is it out of control. The mouthfeel is not quite carbonated syrup; in fact, its a little lighter than I was expecting. As sweet as the palette is, it doesnt leave a sticky, cloying sensation (perhaps it should?). I was able to drink the entire bottle myself on a hot summers night (for whatever thats worth).

Havent really taken the time to review this, although Ive had it probably six or seven times before; I usually only open one with company and dont wanna be rude and review in front of them. This time - the bottle is allll mine!

Pours a nice amber with a fleeting finger of taupe foam - leaving an etched surface. Nose is immaculate - nougat, bourbon, vanilla, fine malt syrup, bits of toffee, some caramalized sugar (near true creme brulee toasting). Flavor is rich and decadent with some maple, bourbon, vanilla, rich malts, some really nice sugars and a caramel flavor. Medium bodied with prickly carbonation. I really dig this beer.

Very smooth grains with a light sweetness that doesn?t show too much heat or lasting susugaryness helped by some caramel flavors and a light accent on dark tree fruits.

The beer is a crimson / brown / ruby color, with just a fleeting glimpse of a head. The aroma is simply fabulous. Delectable bourbon, oak, malt. Perfect blend of flavors. This beer tastes amazing. Incredibly smooth, time has served this old ale very well. The $20+ price tag is a bit steep, but wow, this beer delivers. Alcohol presence is completely unobtrusive. I highly recommend this beer.

A: Pours a semi translucent deep brown and ruby combination with a light tan head forming on the pour. It recedes quickly to a thin ring. No real lace left down the glass, but there are some nice legs.

S: This smells incredible. It is barrel forward with some charred oak, smooth bourbon, and semi-sweet caramel. Dark fruits, mostly raisin, but a touch of fig newton is also present. As it warms more of the bourbon comes out in the nose with a touch of alcohol.

T: Lots of great flavors going on. Definite oak character with some bourbon, residual vanilla and a definite caramel sweetness. Toffee with some fig and sweet malts. There is a slight nutty quality to it as well and it blends with the overall sweetness nicely. There is some definite heat hitting the back of the throat, but its a subtle warming which is very nice.

A - 2-finger slight tan head was produced but faded almost instantly. Very solid alcohol legs on the glass. Sort of a dark brown, hint of amber and plum appearance. 

S - Hint of sweetness and minor maltiness on the nose. Its a very unsuprisingly unsweet scent for a barleywine. Then again, this is an aged beer so perhaps this isnt too surprising. Smokey oak and Bourbon and present but very smooth and not over boozy. The nose overall has a great balance. 

T - This is incredibly hard to describe. First, I get some dark fruits like figs and cherries. Followed by a minor sweetness and hint of delicate vanilla bourbon whiskey. The sweetness is a mix of simple syrup and brown sugar. I love that theres this caramel and candy like taste at the finish. 

M - This coats the tongue and numbs it. Its a mouth numbing beer that has a sort of orajel like feeling when it numbs things. Very heavy body, slick oily texture and vanilla sweetness finish.

3642,"2012-03-28",4.0,"Corked and caged  2009 bottle.  Rated on 3-26-2012.  Pours a large tan fizzy head that quickly diminished.  There was no lacing, hazy body and a reddish hue.

The Mouthfeel is very tingly along with a warming sensation from the bourbon.  This is a medium bodied Barley Wine.  Barley Wine is not one of my favorite beer styles; however, that being said, I REALLY enjoyed sipping on this one.  Yes, it is a sipper at 13.7%ABV.

Alcohol becomes more prominent as it warms a bit. 7+ Flavour is similar, sweet malty core, light bitterness around the edges and modest alcohol presence keep it from becoming cloying. Rich, sweet sugary caramel character, mild wood throughout shows up as mild woody tannins with bourbon overtones in the finish.

3642,"2011-06-08",4.0,"500 ml brown painted bottle at a ridiculous $22.99. The bottle looks like it came from the 1800s or something. Poured a somewhat murky dark reddish brown in a tulip with a small fast fading head. The aroma has a nice medium to strong bourbon barrel character. Just from the aroma alone the base beer(Old Stock) really picked up the barrel character quite well. Lots of vanilla, wood and caramel. The taste is very easy and smooth for the ABV and the fact that its a bourbon barrel barleywine. lots of caramel without being overly sweet, vanilla, wood. Now the middle of the taste seems to fall flat and kind of drifts but no complaints. The palate is very soft and somewhat sticky. My overall score would  be a little higher had the price not been so absurd. Lets see $12-$14 for 48 oz. of the standard Old Stock. While this is $23.00 for almost 17 oz. I do not know if other breweries barrel aged beers have that high of a markup but I guess people buy it.","San Antonio, Texas, USA","Hopper"

3642,"2011-05-09",4.2,"Appearance: deep mahoganies, lightly worn with age and time. No real head, just a few bubbly wisps which disappear as fast as they appear.

Nose: bourbon barrels hit first in all their vanillin caramel molasses goodness. Black root, black strap molasses. Boozed prunes, dates, figs, and earth. Black cherry cordial liquor. European chocolate fudge; burnt Ghirardelli dry and brittle.

Palate: surprisingly light, almost frothy mouthfeel and weight. Sweet then boozy then both. Heat and spice in the back. Black cherry cordials covered in chocolate, aged rum, caramels, and vanillin. Very intense in the middle. Earthy and rooty. Black strap molasses. Boozed figs, dates, and prunes. Coats middle of tongue and dries the sides.

Final Thoughts: I have two bottles aging, but how much longer she needs to age is up for debate. I dont think Ill hang onto them too long, but curiosity calls.

The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of chocolate notes and caramel malt, as well as some bourbon and maple notes. There is also a little bit of vanilla from the barrel aging process. The alcohol is detectable but is not overpowering.

Ill start off by saying that this is the best off-the-shelf beer I have had in a long, long time.

Pours a fairly-deep brown color. Head is extraordinarily weird. It fizzes up like crazy at first and then immediately dies down to nothing. Very reminiscent of cola in that way. In color, too, I suppose. The nose leads with a strong aroma of smooth bourbon. Some molasses and brown sugar are in the background, but the focus is definitely the barrel.

Flavor is much more complex and oh so incredibly smooth. Bourbon hits from the start along with some caramel, molasses, and a hint of burnt sugar. Light vanilla there as well. Bourbon dominates. Mouthfeel is medium and beyond smooth. Simply incredible. This was a sipper, for nothing other than pure enjoyment. Huge fan and I hope they do this more often. Also, please release the brandy version again!

3642,"2011-04-18",4.5,"This is a beer that I couldnt imagine drinking more than a few ozs of at a time.

It smells like no beer Ive ever smelled before, and thats saying quite a bit.  I dont believe Ive ever given a beer a 10 for aroma before, and this beer is almost worth buying just so you can use it as a measuring stick for rating aroma.  This beer is a 10 aroma all the way.  It smells like... well it smells like bourbon.  like vanilla, almonds, and bourbon.  Reminds me of a dessert more than a beer!

The look is quite stellar as well, an opaque brown elixer with a small tan head.  pretty beer.

Taste matches aroma but magnifies it.  Nutty, vanilla notes and BOURBON.  Reminds me of a smokey, malty bourbon/whiskey.  My first thought was that it smelled like Johnny Walker black.  Alcohol comes through, but obviously this is a very big beer.  Big taste, big sweetness, big alcohol.

Palate is not adversely affected by the alcohol, still feels thick enough, oily mouthfeel with just a hint of prickle.

Overall, an unforgettable beer that Id recommend if you have a few people to drink it with.  if youre planning to drink the bottle yourself, good luck.

Definitely not my favorite style, but an interesting experience and a beer that challenges my eloquence and eventually, I just backed down to the challenge.  Nearly indescribable.","","alexjucla"

Ive seldom come across a brew where the taste matches the nose verbatim, but this one is a bona fide ringer.

I get some of the dry whiskey in the taste but there is also sweet raisin/date, licorice, and dark fruit over subtle, sweet barley wine.  Definite barrel influenced alcohol tinge through and after the finish.  Fairly clean, albeit thin feel in the mouth.

Aroma, even through the foam, is a smooth blend of cherries, vanilla, bourbon, and wood from the barrel.  Taste is richly of much the same as the nose.  Bourbon up front, followed by vanilla and dark fruits, coming by turns in waves throughout the mid and late palate.  Finish is smooth.  Much more than expected.  There is a bit of a burn going down, but for the ABV on this, its very impressively hidden.  Wonderful stuff.

Sweet malts, light wood and some vanilla too.  Well done in every way.  Carbonation was somewhat fizzy and big but settled in nicely.  The finish was a bit hot but expected.

3642,"2011-01-20",4.4,"2009 vintage, consumed fresh:

Pours a deep, dark ruby red color with dark mahogany edges when held to a light source and a one finger fizzy, light beige head that quickly fades into a thin ring. Not much in the way of lacing.

Amazing aroma with lots of sweet bourbon, earthy oak, vanilla and marshmallow along with lots of earthy, leathery malt notes. Hints of toffee, caramel and hazelnut sweetness along with subtle booze. The barrel aging has done wonders for the nose of this beer and instead of smelling like a complete bourbon bomb, there is a lot of complexity. I smelled this beer for several minutes before taking the first sip. Amazing!

Soft carbonation up front with a silky medium body that has a complex flavor profile, slight alcohol heat and subtle warmth in the finish. As in the aroma, the barrel aging is prominent in the flavor. Lots of earthy oak, vanilla and prominent bourbon without being hot. Although the bourbon flavor is there it doesnt burn your chest or overpower the other characteristics. Lots of earthy, leathery malt with hints of toffee, hazelnut, caramel and biscuit. Sweet alcohol and dark fruit notes, mostly raisin, date, fig and plum. As mentioned above, there is only slight heat/warmth and the ABV of this beer is incredibly well masked. At this young of an age I was expecting this to be a complete boozy, bourbon bomb. Instead, it is a complex, flavorful, well balanced and quaffable barrel aged beer. Im really looking forward to trying the brandy version and the earlier bourbon vintage.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

3642,"2011-01-14",3.5,"2009 Vintage. Pours deep, dark, almost opaque but with deep ruby coming through when held up to the light. Incredibly active carbonation, theres an incessant stream of bubbles coming off my glass laser etchings at a high rate of speed.  The aroma is bourbon, tons and tons of bourbon.  Its hard to get much beyond that.  All the rich complexity of Old Stock doesnt stand up to the bourbon bomb that this puppy is.  Huge warming burn on the finish, lingering astringency, incredibly sweet and syrupy, extremely zippy from the high carbonation.  As it opens up, which you should give it time to, it does begin to lose some its unruliness.  Caramel, burnt marshmallow, toffee flavors are there, hiding behind the bourbon. Its good, its just not remotely $22 good.  Its not even $10 good.  Its a huge let down for a beer at this price.  Dinging this one points on the overall due both to the messy nature of the tastes and palate and the price point this ones at.

I dont know if any beer warrants a charge of that nature, but I took the plunge and you know what, Im glad that I did. Its very effervescent. There was a slight presence of head, but it fizzed away. This has a nice rich, brown color. Its transparent. Its a decent looking brew. Lots of dimensions make up the aroma. It has a nice vanilla, whiskey, and sweet malt aroma. The beer is subtly pungent, but in a big way. The aforementioned statement seems a bit paradoxical, but its true. Bits of a raisin aroma hit my nose, as well. The sweet aroma coming from the malt balance perfectly with the whiskey aroma. Wow, it seems like its going to be a little too hot. No, wait, wow, that son-of-a-bitch is steaming all the way down. It has a nice sweet vanilla, whiskey, oak, raisin, and malt flavor. Damn, despite the burn, this beer is really good. Its a little too boozy. I wonder if time would fix the aforementioned issue.

Appearance:  Pours a dark mahogany with a dancing seltzer like head that quickly dissapears to nothing.

Overall: An amazing beer. I love Old Stock as it is, but this is the equivalent of bacon wrapped fillet.

The aroma is really nice and rich showing notes of dark fruits, nougat, sweet caramel,and oak laden vanilla. The bourbon influence is subtle and adds smoothness and added depth. The flavor follows suit with the dark fruits, rich caramel, and toasted oak. The bourbon adds its signature vanilla influence to smooth things out and tie everything together. The bourbon is just right in this brew as it doesnt over power any one thing and adds complexity. The mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth, and very easy to drink with subtle carbonation leading to a sweet, slightly warming finish. Despite the high abv the alcohol is hidden nicely, which makes this a smooth drinker. The bourbon barrel takes a good base beer and makes it even better.

3642,"2010-12-07",4.0,"In short: A Big syrupy Bourbon-heavy barley wine (duh!).  Very good at what it is
How: Bottle 375ml.  First and only batch.  Consumed when about 2.5 year of age.  All three versions side-by-side.  Bottle sent to me by WeeHeavySD, thanks a lot Jon.
The look: Cloudy purple-brown body topped by a beige ring of foam.
In long:  Cork comes out with a disappointingly lack of pop but the beer is well carbonated.  Nose has molasses (something the two other versions do not have) and lots of bourbon barrel.  Taste is molasses, lots of vanilla, black liquorice, earthy tobacco, some bourbon, ripe dark fruits.  Finish has a light cigarette butt flavor.  For some reason this version felt a tiny bit smoky and I did not get any smoke at all from the other two versions.  Body is fat and viscous and appropriately carbonated.  Very different from the regular Old Stock.  It didnt feel like a bourbonized version of the regular Old Stock, it felt like a totally different beer.  I really liked it.

3642,"2009-01-14",4.1,"Grabbed this gem in a trade with Solomon420 a few months back.  375mL bottle poured into a snifter.

Pours a dark hazy caramel brown with a small cream-colored head that hangs around as a decent collar for a while and doesnt leave much lacing.

The first aroma out of the bottle was the bourbon which remained the dominant smell throughout.  There are plenty of other things in the nose with some caramel sweetness, figs, raisins and molasses.  On top of all that is the vanilla from the barrel.

The taste followed the aroma but with more of the underlying beer coming out.  The sugary sweetness comes out more aggressively and the bourbon plays a more supporting role (which is a positive for me).

The mouthfeel is sticky sweet and medium bodied with minimal carbonation.  There is a slight alcohol burn through the finish.

This is a great, great beer and very drinkable given the ABV.  A (very) small notch below the Brandy Barrel, but thats pretty good company.  Big thanks to Damian for sharing this rarity.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Aroma is a lovely mix of brown sugar, peppermint, toffee vanilla, wood, sweet booze, wood, and just a bit of raspberry glaze (like for cheesecakes).  Fantastic nose, a bit hot, but what do I care when it smells so good?  Flavor is a bit more subdued than the aroma in comparison with a heavily boozy, woody flavor; some brown sugar, toffee, chocolate, vanilla and lot of alcohol make their appearance as well.  Finishes very hot with a pleasant vanilla and brown sugar flavor up front, wood and buttered toast on the back and a mellow toasty bitterness.  The body of this beer seems a bit strange overall.  What should be thick and creamy is only somewhat thick, and completely lacking in that soft creamy mouthfeel that I know this beer should have.  What happened to the carbonation?  Its plenty carbonated, but without the creaminess.  The regular 05 Old Stock behaves a lot more normally.

The malts are caramel, dark fruit and sweet. The hops are earthy. This one is more oak and bourbon sweetness than the Brandy Barrel aged version, it has more oak and wood than fruit. Still very smooth tasting. . Hides the 14.5% alcohol very well. Some chocolate and toffee flavors emerge as it warms. Nice beer. There are lots of flavors mixing going on around here.

Well it did have the classic muddy murky brown color but instead of no or slight head there was an average very fizzy beige head. Aroma of bourbon, vanilla, booze and barrel. Medium bodied but with lots of carbonation, very uncharacteristic for a barley wine. Flavor of lots of bourbon, wood, and finishes with some caramel and toffee notes.

The nose is heavily bourbon-y with oak, vanilla, big brown sugar, moderate alcohol vapors, and tons of heavy malt.  The flavor is actually pretty mellow on the bourbon thankfully, way way more of the vanilla and woody notes up front.  The boozyness comes out a little on the finish, but just like the regular Old Stock, its second fiddle to the huge maltiness.  Nice char, oak, and vanilla linger on late into the finish.  The mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth with zero stickiness, it really has a wonderful aged feel to it.  A good bit of warmth radiates from the chest with every sip, but I really wouldnt say that this is ""hot"" at all.

Eventually the beer settles into a velvety appearance that likens itself to a fine aperitif with legs coating the snifter, and a dark & clear burgundy color. The aroma is straight up killer! Loaded with vanilla, bourbon, musty oak and toffee. Fantastic! The barrel-aging has really done its magic on this one. Flavors have a much more pronounced bourbon and oak character, with deep and spicy caramel and notes. Oxidation is noticeable in the finish, and there is a slight sting on the back of the tongue. Slightly numbing mouthfeel that is topped off with a warming alcohol finish. Almost ends up overly-boozy, but it stays well within the tolerable range.

Very little psst when I uncorked the bottle.  A small head of medium bubbles forms when I pour, but they fade very fast.  The beer is carbonated, but the bubbles pop when the hit the surface, leaving no head.  Lack of head keeps appearance score down.  Cloudy deep amber color.  The aroma has wonderful oxidation and oak and light bourbon highlights.  The bourbon is much more pronounced when drinking.  The gravity seems low for such a high alcohol beer, with a light bubble burn on the tongue, like a soda.  Im guessing this is because of the high alcohol percentage.  Tons of oak.  Some sweetness, but the high alcohol hides it.  Very fun and interesting to drink. Wouldnt want to drink to much though.  Needs a cheese accompanyment with its strength.  Very good. 9,3,8,3,17:4.0

3642,"2008-03-03",3.9,"Bottle from toncatcher -- thanks so much.

Another beer Id been very eager to try. Im a big fan of the regular Old Stock (though not so much the 14+% version). Pours a caramel brown, rich and still, looking and smelling like bourbon - heavy acerbic oak aroma, tons of barrel influence, dates, bourbon of course. Powerful, powerful fumes! Nice sweet flavors, caramel and rich malts, indeed much like the old stock, but even boozier, lots of vanilla, mouth-drying oak. Here the bourbon works better on a barleywine base than it usually does, Id say. Its like drinking liquor rather than beer, from the massive aroma to the heat on the tongue and the back of the throat to the thickness of the mouthfeel. 

Its a fascinating beer, pushing the edge of what I think of as beer toward what I think of as bourbon, but in the end I cant rate it as highly as the best bottles of well-aged regular old stock. Its too harsh, the bourbon is too forward. Maybe with 3 more years it would mellow and the barrel character would meld into the base malts, but right now its a serious bourbon BA show.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Spicy fig fruits, gooey caramels, and sticky maple syrup add further complexity.  Incredibly boozey, but wonderfully so.  Full bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel with a soft, tickling texture.  Brown sugar and maple syrup malt sweetness up front on the palate, along with lighter, balancing flavors of vanilla, coconut, and caramel.  Some dark fruity characters start to come out mid-palate, raisin and prune, but this transitions into a spicy fig sensation as the oak character starts to take over.  The finish is all oak, leaving a husky, spicy woody character lingering on the palate in the final smack with some tingling bourbon.

3642,"2008-02-01",3.9,"Pours with a quickly dissipating, initially one-finger thick, tan colored head.  The beer is a dark, rusted amber color, but shows a brilliantly clear, full cranberry color when held up to the light.  Ample Bourbon and sharp oak notes greet my nose, but it is far more integrated and smoother than many Bourbon Barrel beers.  In fact the barrel character is right on par with the Brandy barrel version; certainly dominant, but well integrated and pleasing to the olfactory senses.  Notes of spicy Bourbon, vanillin, ample butterscotch laden oak, definite warming alcohol notes and a touch of spicy wood are all noticeable parts of the barrel aging.  The barrel notes are well supported by a substantial, but clearly secondary, malt character; ample caramelized malt notes help to smooth out the barrel notes and especially marry well with the vanillin and butterscotch notes.  Some berry-like fruitiness, a sweet nuttiness and toasty browned malts are also part of the malt profile.  After my nose gets used to the aroma a bit the barrel character seems to die down a bit, but it never loses the ample warming note from the alcohol.

Sweet, but as was the sister brew, this is very light feeling for a beer of this strength.  The alcohol is omnipresent and seems to quickly go to my head, though I would not characterize it as overly hot, merely substantially warming.  Nutty flavors seem to accent wood derived notes of butterscotch and vanillin; the latter two being the more noticeable notes.  The malt provides fruity notes of raisins and berries that, in combination with the booze, make this taste a bit like Brandy.  This is clearly Bourbon influenced though as it has a characteristically spicy edge to it, especially in the finish.  The barrel notes are huge here, somehow this beer holds them in check though; the base beer manages to keep the barrel from becoming overly aggressive.  The Bourbon character somehow manages to be so present here in the flavor, but it still does not become disagreeable (am I becoming more used to Bourbon notes in beer, a distinct possibility, or is this just that well integrated).

Definitely harder than the Brandy barrel aged version, but not overly so and I can see this appealing more to some people.  The sharper barrel notes, which the Bourbon brings out, are really nice though and make this beer different enough (in a good way) from the Brandy that I find that I am enjoying this beer far more than I thought I would.  I really think that trying this beer after I sampled the Brandy one (separated by days) has made me enjoy this beer all that much more.  If I had had it at the same time, or before the other one, I dont think I would have enjoyed it as much.  The differences that my memory has played out seem to be the most intriguing part of this beer.  What this relies on though is the fact that this beer, while clearly barrel dominated, does not allow the barrel notes to overwhelm & marginalize the base beer.  In the end it is a little too alcohol accented in the flavor to be on the same level as the Brandy barrel aged old stock, but it is still damn tasty and quite close.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Once you get past that, you can retain some dark fruits, apples, and a noticeable alcohol burn.  The flavor is of rich caramel and monster boozy bourbon.  The fruits are more noticeable in the finish once it gets past the big bourbon wave up front.  The aftertaste burns somewhat, almost like the after effects of taking a shot of alcohol.

As the bottle was passed down the line my eyes lit up as if I was a child waking up late on Christmas Eve. Oh the sounds of Santa Claus bringing an unknown Christmas surprise! My friends this is truly my milk and cookies! Finally the liquid black gold has filled my humble glass. The copper color gives way to brown much like the parched ground after a much needed rain storm. Upon sniffing the beer Im taken away to the old whiskey houses of Tennessee. I can see the humble workers placing their pride and joy in the barrels to be aged and enjoyed by all. The caramel I smell, oh my golly goodness, is caramel covered apples that grandmammy gave to all the neighborhood groundlings. Once the brew hit my lips the real fun has just begun. One thinks the whiskey might not come forth but indeed it does. And it does with gusto! The molasses comes out as if it was time for the morning pancakes. The dark fruits dance about my tongue. Im having daydreams of prunes and raisins. At the back of this house of pleasure comes a dose of vanilla extract. Just like a fine wine or a fine woman this one needs some age on it to be fully appreciated. But like most things in life, the age brings on the beauty!

Sweet maple up front, chewy and rich, turning more hot with the bourbon and wood tannins showing up, finishing with a hot bite over the back and a lingering buttery bourbon and bread flavor.

3642,"2007-12-14",3.9,"375mL bottle.  Pours a murky brownish color with yellowed edges, similar to a dark cup of tea; yellowish-tan head retaining a slight perimeter of bubbles; looks a bit messy from the beginning, reminiscent of some of the lesser BA offerings from Drakes.  The aroma offers quite a bit: not exactly a sweet, oozing bourbon character, but plenty of cedar and toastiness and a bit of butterscotch (not buttery, but something closer to a caramel candy chewiness); theres also a stalky/green earthiness hovering over everything in the nose.  Its certainly not shy.  Plenty of warming bourbon in the mouthfeel, even at first contact: a lively jolt of citrus at the very tip, following by a mouthfilling chewy bourbon character: dense toasted oak, some butter, and just an enormous warming presence that made me forget we keep the thermostat at 68; its certainly a bit muddled, in a way that actually reminds me a lot of the recent BA Old Numbskull release or, again, some of the Drakes BA beers; but the bourbon character here is excellent and generous and filling; any slight roughness at the edges is kept in check by a lively citrus note and very reasonable levels of carbonation; a slightly muddled, tasty barrel-aged beer with a fair amount of dried fruits and caramel lurking beneath the barrel.  Definitely a sipper for cold evenings.  Lengthy, toasty oak and butter and bourbon in the finish; very warming.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
3642,"2007-12-11",3.9,"Ruby tints that fade to brief soft pinks glaze the edging of a very dark chestnut body, translucent from above but far too dark to see through from a sideways glance. A thin ring of carbonation breaks at the edge of the glass, no head forms. The nose is melodramatic and understated at once. Alcohol plays a less pivotal role in the dominance of character in this barreled version of Old Stock. Bourbon is fine and elegant, a transitional piece between sultry vanilla and tannic barrel nuances and a softly hopped barleywine of impeccable character. This is more refined than its counterpart, therefore not as engaging; still just as interesting though, due to such nobility expressed through a combination of heritage and seemless barrel aging/blending. Vanilla is strong, bourbon is moderate, spice is adequate. Nothing overpowers, everything is easy to grasp, nothing is simplistic. Caramel becomes the dominant aroma as the temperature approaches that of the surrounding room. Dark fruit is intertwined with sugary malts, mainly apricot and dates. Alcohol is medium-high in kick, less than the other version, but less interesting too. This is a damn tasty barleywine. A dense wall of microscopic carbonation evenly disperses sweet caramel over the tongue and clogs up the back of the throat, creating a barrier that forces tannic waves into the deepest corners of the cheeks and drives spice into the tastebuds. Sweetness is high but doesnt seem overwhelming. Tannins are as strong as Ive encountered in a barrel-aged brew. Fruits seems glazed with bourbon, much like what would be found on a dessert platter at an overpriced brunch outing. Burned caramel malts linger in a lightly roasty and lightly bitter finish that leaves mild astringency around to clean up the stressed palate. Carbonation mustve been pinned down by a syrupy body, because its quite vibrant at the conclusion of each tantalizing sip. This is destined for greatness, but that might take a while.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
3642,"2007-12-11",3.9,"UPDATED: SEP 24, 2008 Pours a deep brown, with some ruby highlights shining through.  Aroma is full bore whisky, walking the razor’s edge between balanced and overblown.  Vanilla, burnt orange, plums, dates, a touch of smoke, divinity candy (it’s a Southern thing), warm meringue, toffee and spice cake are all in there.  While not as elegant as the brandy, there is certainly a lot going on here.   Flavor is a bit more agressive, with the whisky being a dominant, almost bullying component.  There is a creamy sweetness trying to play along, but seems to have difficulty in asserting it’s profile.  There is a faint hint of honey again here, but ever so lightly on the finish.

3642,"2007-12-07",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2008 Bottle.  Just arrived today and since Ive been sitting at my computer for almost eight hours straight doing paperwork, I figured Id take a nice afternoon break.  The beer pours a very deep brown color with little carbonation.  Even when poured from some height there is only a small brown head that dissipates almost immediately.  Im going to assume it was only recently bottled and I may be opening this one a bit early.  Big vanilla and bourbon aromas fill the room even before you bring the glass to your nose. Tons of alcohol dominate the aromas; oak, tons of bourbon, brown sugar and caramel as well.  The flavor consists of vanilla, bourbon, Coca-Cola, burnt sugars, pears, dark fruits and more.  Almost searing alcohol warmth, tastes like there should be a proof on the label rather than an ABV.  I agree with JohnC that age will be nice to this beer.  Im putting the rest away for some time.

Re-Rate.  Bottle.  I’ve sat on this for about  eight months now and I was curious as to how it’s doing.  Theres definitely much more carbonation now although the head fades very quickly.  Smells like I’m drinking a Jack and Coke (not that I would drink either, anymore), bourbon, bourbon and bourbon.  When you raise the glass to your nose you can pick up a more complex, woody aroma with some herbal and roast notes.  Big vanilla flavors still.  Strong bourbon notes as well but the alcohol no longer hits you over the head (although it’s still present).  The body seems a bit thin to compete with the big bourbon notes and the alcohol but that’s my only gripe with this awesome beer.","Concord, California, USA","ChillCoat"
