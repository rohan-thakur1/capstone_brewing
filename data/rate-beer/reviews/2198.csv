Oktoberfest it is.","Tampere, FINLAND","rosenbergh"
2198,"2015-11-30",3.8,"Bomber courtesy of jackl. Thanks! Clear amber with a medium sized foamy tan head. Good retention. Aroma of toasted malts and caramel. The taste is toasted malt, caramel, mild grassy hops. Medium bodied, well balanced, simple and well executed.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
2198,"2015-10-16",3.6,"22 oz. bottle pours clear gold with a tight white thin head that fizzes away to a film that lasts with constant good looking carbonation. Aroma has a light clean straight forward octoberfest beer with nice soft sweet malt light spice and even softer hop presence. Taste is slightly bitter and mild spice clean sweet malt a hint of banana/wheat, very drinkable. Palate is thin fizzy and clean with a touch of dryness in the finish.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"
2198,"2015-10-11",3.7,"(bomber poured in stein) Pours a dark gold color with a large and well retained white head. Aroma is strong of cereal grains and smells similar to a box of freshly opened bran cereal. Little orange-like kicks (more marmalade than anything else) arise and provide a nice contrast to the malt. Further fruit characteristics include a bit of peach, but more in a candied form like peach rings. A bit of toastiness comes through as well. Lot of breakfast characteristics (aside from the peach rings) going on here. Flavor holds a lot of smooth caramel and toasty malt before transitioning up to a pop of orange zest that quickly collapses back down with a crisp, minerally, finish.  In between the toast  to zest transition lies a little bit of apple butter, which took some warming of the beer to tease out. Mouthfeel is medium and carb is appropriate. Overall a very solid o-fest.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

2198,"2015-10-04",3.5,"Picked up a single 22-oz bomber from Heritage Liquors in Maplewood, Minnesota. Pours a semi-clear golden orange colored brew with an average sized off-white head that slowly dissipates and leaves behind some excellent lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, some Märzen yeast, a hint of hard pitted fruits and some floral hops. Taste is medium bodied, some sharp spicy and grassy hops that was not detected in aroma with flavors of sweet caramel malt, and some mild apple. Finish is semi-sweet with a short spicy hop aftertaste that slowly disappears. Best to describe this as an Americanized Vienna-style oktoberfest.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
2198,"2015-09-22",3.8,"Clear darker gold; healthy head retention. Toffee, plum, honey malt and sweet grass aroma; excellent balance, not so much sweetness. Restrained, simplified. Clean flavor, brisk and crushable. The deep sweetness of Munich is intimated but not broadcasted; resulting, golden raisins, blonde brownie, and toasted barley shine in subtlety. Likewise, palate is punchy but clean, demanding gulps like it should. Minimal sweetness at the end; a winsome departure from the gritty, weighty sugars of many an American example.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
