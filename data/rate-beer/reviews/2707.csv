2707,"2017-01-17",3.7,"Gylden og lettere diset Premium Lager med flygtig hvidlig skumkrone på 1-2 cm, som svinder til et par mm. 
Ganske frugtrig aroma af tropisk frugt som papaya, melon og noter af citrus. 
Smagen er ganske humlebitter, men også med klare frugtnoter. Frisk i udtrykket med en fin balance mellem frugtsødme og bitterhed. 
Øllet har en middel fyldig krop med en tynd konsistens. Karboneret på et medium niveau og med en tør bitter afslutning. 
Overall: Let drikkelig, frisk, humlet og velafbalanceret Pale Ale/Premium Lager. 
330 ml, flaske, 5.0 % ABV, BB: 14/02/17, købt i Meny på Borups Allé på Frederiksberg.
