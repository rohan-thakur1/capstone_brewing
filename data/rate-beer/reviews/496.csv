Together with the lively carbonation, that makes the beer refreshing, but it also quite surprising, to the point where Im not so fond of that sudden change. Palate is fair, cherry, but rather short.

496,"2016-10-08",3.3,"2015 BJCP Category: 30A Spice/Herb/Vegetable (base style: 20B American Stout)
AROMA: Candybar-like milk chocolate is prominent. Sweet dark malt with light roast. Faint cinnamon. 8/12APPEARANCE: Inky opaque black body. Small, tan foam fizzles away quickly. No lacing. 1/3FLAVOR: This stout is brewed with graham crackers, molasses and ""natural flavors,"" though the strongest flavor is vanilla (milk chocolate). I do not get cinnamon or marshmallow (theyve probably faded). Quite sweet throughout, but not cloying. Faint taste of roasted malt on the finish. Low bitterness with trace of piney hops. Tasty, but simple and repetitive. 14/20MOUTHFEEL: Medium-light body; fairly low CO2. Texture is soft and smooth with no alcohol presence. Slight milky aftertaste, otherwise clean. 3/5OVERALL IMPRESSION: A novel idea for a brew thats tasty without becoming cloying. A little smoked malt would enhance the ""campfire"" theme. Probably more robust and complex when fresh. 7/10TOTAL SCORE: 33/50NOTE: I am a rank-pending BJCP judge.

The flavor follows suit with the dark chocolate, caramel and toasted vanilla up front to go with notes of graham cracker and some earth roast to add some balancing bitterness.

496,"2016-02-07",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Vanilla, lactose and milk chocolate swim around in this silky take on a Milk Stout.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam covers the darkness.
-The nose is a surefire replica of marshmallows and melting milk chocolate.
-The mouthfeel is rich yet easygoing.
-The flavor profile is leaning too heavily on the vanilla and lactose, imho.
-This would be a dessert lovers delight on nitro.
-Cereals (and graham crackers) could be more apparent in the flavor profile.

The smell starts off with rich sweet milk chocolate with a light graham cracker lightening the sweetness. As it warmed, marshmallow does come out nicely. Some coffee notes do round it all out.
The taste was moderately sweet with the balance between the graham cracker maintaining a sweet to super light bitter coffee aftertaste. Theres a sweet sticky finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Carbonation runs extremely light, almost drinks like coffee its so smooth.

very nice stout cause of unique flavor of chocolate cake, notes of cocoa, milky but not as lactic as milk/sweet stouts.

AROMA of artificial vanilla, dusty grains and graham crackers, mild chocolate, and light smoke.

Some lingering smoke in the finish. Nice spritzy carbonation. I had this on draft a couple months back and remember liking it better. The graham crackers were stronger in the taste in the draft version...was hoping for a strong graham cracker presence here, but it didnt really show.

4.0 A: Black color. One and a half fingers of frothy tan head. Retention is about average and a good bit of lacing is left.

4.5 S: The nose sure as hell delivers as advertised. Lots of marshmallow, which is something I rarely find in a stout (or any beer), tons of chocolate, and a light graham cracker. Roasty underneath with a lactose-like sweetness. Superbly pleasant and definitely unique.

3.5 T: Though the nose is dead on for smores, the taste is not. Its surprisingly bitter and whether this is from too much hops or just the roasted barley is anyones guess. Secondly, its not nearly as sweet as I would have guessed. Lactose does give a bit of marshmallow, but I think this is mainly since the nose implanted the idea. The chocolate is insufficient and the graham cracker biscuitiness is lacking. Still, its not bad, but its a huge disappointment after the awesomeness of the nose.

3.0 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation, though I wouldnt mind a touch more. Im not crazy about the mouthfeel because its heavy without being particularly creamy.

3.5 D: Decent beer. Worth a try just for the nose. This would have scored a lot better is the bitterness wasnt so distracting.

The aroma is chocolate, coffee, marshmallows, graham crackers and sweet. (Yup it smells like a smore). A medium bodied stout. The malts are chocolate, coffee and sweet. The hops are earthy. Nice carbonation. Its a nice stout, but the graham cracker and marshmallows make it a smore in a bottle with 7.3% alcohol. Nuff said. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
496,"2012-07-04",3.4,"Campfire Stout, tap at PP OB. Black body with ruby edges, and a small beige head, quickly fading to a ring. Flavor has some sweet graham cracker toastiness, some lightly sweet chocolate, then follows through to a burnt ashy dry bitter finish, bitterness peaking at a 5. The aroma ws much more dessert-like and smores-ish. Sweet buttery graham cracker and chocolate dominate, light roast behind. Low prickly carbonation with a light to med body. Not bad, but but a little disappointed. I like Joe Shorts version better. 8-3-7-3-13--3.4","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
496,"2012-06-08",3.9,"From the second you pour it into the glass it has the graham cracker aroma, it is one of the most unique Stouts I have had.  Worth a try if you like Smores... and really who doesnt like em?","Corning, California, USA","OPbrewcrew"
496,"2012-06-03",4.2,"Wow, they pulled it off. This really does smell like a smore with toasted marshmallow and milk chocolate aroma.  Black with a healthy tan head. Tastes like a Hersheys kiss and I can definitely pick up the graham cracker.  Finishes with a heavily roasted bitter malt.","California, USA","doublebock"
496,"2012-05-18",3.4,"On tap at Tap 25. It pours a very dark brown with a brown head. The aroma is amazingly exactly like the description. Tons of graham cracker maltiness with some sweet, non-descript sugariness that recalls marshmallows. Hints of coffee and chocolate as well. Props for nailing the aroma! The flavor unfortunately falls a bit short. On first sip, I get a lot of tartness on the palate. Not berry like or astringent, just a bit puckering... There is definitely some some smoke and chocolate, but the tartness overpowers in the end. It finishes really dry and roasted. Weird, considering the sweetness of the aroma. The body is full, so I dont expect any wild yeast here. Overall, this is not my favorite High Water beer, but I love what Steve is doing. This one is just OK in my book.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
496,"2012-05-13",3.8,"Tap at Taps restaurant in Petaluma. Fun beer! Huge marshmallow, graham cracker, and vanilla on nose and taste.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
496,"2012-05-05",3.6,"Black pour with small tan head. Nose is totally a campfire, chocolate, bready malts, sweetness and a hint of smoke. Creamy body. Chocolate and sweetness throughout. A solid stout. A little gimmicky and too sweet if im honest.","New York, New York, USA","mrmartin"
496,"2012-05-04",3.4,"Bottle. Pours with a black body and a huge, creamy tan head. Good retention and lace. Appears a bit over carbbed. Aromas are big, powerful roast, dusty cocoa nibs, marshmallow, vanilla, light smoke. A very pungently earthy/chocolatey aroma. Grainy, dry nutty, very light hints of styrofoam. Flavors are dry, bitter, a bit nutty, bready grainy. Oddly dry and lightly acidic. Vanilla, cocoa nibs, earthy, coffee, dry roast. Some marshmallow like character. Some graham cracker like maltiness. Not really working as it is very dry with a slight acidic edge that detracts. Very lively bubbles, a bit thin, dry medium smoke.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
496,"2012-05-01",3.7,"This is really nice...the description is spot-on.  VERY reminiscent of Denver Brewings Graham Cracker Porter (a GABF Bronze 2011)...DBC doesnt bottle so if you want to know what its like try this.  Big sweet marshmallow and graham on the nose.   Taste is the same...sweet upfront but dry with a bitter very dark roasted coffee and dark chocolate finish.  Body could be a little fuller, but Im splitting hairs at this point...Stout treatment is nice on this...mouthfeel is better than DBCs Graham...this is also much more bitter on the end.  Very, very nice.

>>>editing after this has warmed up...mouthfeel in particular has fallen apart and taste has backed off.  Keep it cold and youll be happy..still smells great.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"
496,"2012-04-29",4.0,"Super dark brown pour, brown head.  Aroma of graham, toasted marshmallow(burned edges included!), fudge and light hops.  Flavor is sweet, smores, light bitter finish and a slight metallic note at the end.  Drink it now.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
496,"2012-04-27",3.4,"Draft. Black beer with a tan head. Marshmallow and light roast aroma. Marshmallow and roast flavor. Medium bodied. Sweet marshmallow and roast lingers with light chooclate. Add in some graham crackers and you have smores.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
496,"2012-04-22",3.8,"Bottle from Healthy Spirits. Pours dark brown with a thick tan head and a chocolate mousse aroma. There is a hearty chocolate and marshmallow flavor. I dont know what they put in this beer, but it tastes like real marshmallows. Interesting and tasty.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
496,"2012-04-13",4.0,"Bomber from The Davis Beer Shoppe. Pours very dark brown/black with a 4 finger darkish tan creamy/foamy head that does some convoluted lacing. Aroma is chocolate and .... wait for it ... graham flour. Strange! Maybe also a hint of treacle. Med + body. Flavor is very graham flour with chocolate (maybe coffee too) and some sweetness that might as well be marshmallow. Interesting. The graham aspect dominates. But chocolate persists into the finish.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
496,"2012-04-12",4.4,"Pours deep brown with an exceptional dark tan head. Full nose of graham crackers and chocolate. The flavor has a smooth marshmallow in addition to the influences in the nose, and surprisingly doesnt go to sticky or cloying. Medium full mouthfeel and of course, a fair amount of sweetness.","SF Bay Area, California, USA","AgentSteve"
