3608,"2014-11-13",5.0,"I really enjoyed this. I am not a fan of the stronger ales but good drinking ales are hard to come by. We need more of these very very drinkable beers. Well done guys. This and Townsends Dinner Ale are my favorites in this class.","NEW ZEALAND","nakedeyedv"
3608,"2014-06-14",3.7,"Sampled at its best from hand-pull at Goldings in Wellington. Tasty tart fruit with balanced bitter finish in remarkably low alcohol content","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","beer-yum"
3608,"2014-02-07",3.5,"The head is medium, body brown and cloudy. It smells fruity, peach, hoppy. The taste is hoppy, fruity, bit peach, aromatic, bit orange-peel. A bit bitter in the aftertaste, ok. 3,5","Otorohanga, NEW ZEALAND","kiwianer"
3608,"2013-10-04",2.9,"On hand pump pours slightly cloudy, yellow golden with white head. Aroma is of peaches, dust and baking soda. Taste is very light then smooth bitter milkiness comes through. Creamy aftertaste.","Auckland Central, NEW ZEALAND","Brodies_Best"
3608,"2013-08-18",4.0,"Tap at the Twisted Hop, at a tasting session with Travlr and Jimthechap. Lovely beer, with a great balance between a seductive maltiness, apricots, and a citrus (grapefruit?) bitterness. It goes down so damn easy and still has an alluring mouthfeel. One could indeed doubt if anyone could concoct a better bitter than this.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"
3608,"2013-08-02",3.7,"Cask handpull at the Campus Club near Hamilton, courtesy of Allen, thank you sir! Clear go.den color, small thick white head. Aroma is fruity citrus and fresh hay. Taste is peppery and moderately bitter very easy to drink.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
3608,"2013-04-25",3.3,"very spicy and yeasty, along with light fruits and a fairly lasting bitterness. not sure if this is what it normally tastes like, but it was pretty good.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","lisagirl"
3608,"2010-06-10",3.5,"This is exactly what it says on the tin, a great session beer.  It is a very smart example and the best available in New Zealand in the lighter cask conditioned style.","AUSTRALIA","ilovebeernz"
3608,"2010-04-22",3.2,"Draft. a golden beer with a thin beige head. The aroma has notes of malt and caramel. The flavor is sweet with lovely notes of grass and hops, leading to a hay-like finish.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
3608,"2009-12-27",3.8,"the best of the twisted beers in my opinion. a huge and wild blackcurrant aroma, along with appetising fresh yeasty caskbeer smells. salty, drily malty and fruity, with not too much crystal malt to get in the way of the bitter and moreish finish. very skullable. a nice kiwi-hop tweak of the classic english model.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"
3608,"2009-10-20",3.7,"Part of the tasting rack at the brewpub, cask conditioned.  Pours a cloudy gold color with a small white head.  Aroma of floral hops, fruits, and citrus.  Flavor of dry hops, with citrus and other fruits.  Bitter, with a dry finish.  Light bodied, flavorful, and sessionable.  Really good bitter.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3608,"2009-05-24",3.8,"Part of the tasting tray shared with my lovely wife at the brewpub in Christchurch, enjoyed with the charcouterie plate and cheese plate. Light orange amber with a lacy white head. Very aromatic fruity and floral hop aroma (orange blossom?) with an underlying stemminess. Very light, but VERY flavourful palate driven by the fresh aromatic hops. Nice bitter finish.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
3608,"2009-04-11",3.8,"Draught at the Twisted Hop, Christchurch. Pours a beautiful golden with a creamy white head. Good lacing around the inside of the glass. Fresh aroma of citrus and floral notes. The flavour is malt and fruit. Smooth and bitter finish. A great session beer...delicious!","Boomtown!, AUSTRALIA","nate2g"

3608,"2008-12-21",4.0,"Tried on tap at beervana. Delicious flowery passionfruit(?) aroma. Lovely citrus fruit flavours that are balanced by a lingering bitterness, lovely beer!",", NEW ZEALAND","nutpea"
3608,"2008-10-24",4.0,"Handpull at the brewpub in Chch, takes a long time to settle after going through the sparkler, but does eventually to a light gold with a think creamy head. It has a great full mouthfeel (for only 3.7%), flowery hops, and delicious. Close to the perfect sessional bitter.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","TheGrandMaster"
3608,"2008-09-15",3.4,"Hand pump at Beervana 2008. Pours slight cloudy golden, diminishing white head. Aroma is fruity/berry, quite sweet. Flavour is strongly herby, tastes of basil mainly. Slight bitterness with the hops. Dry finishing and very nice.","Wellington, New Zealand, NEW ZEALAND","donfardz64"
3608,"2008-04-18",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 20, 2008 My first taste at the twisted hop and i wasnt disappointed. Pours a straw pale colour with ample head, lovely fruity hop nose released with the use of a sparkler. Beautiful malty flavour with a late hop kick....possibly leans towards the hop more than the malt but thats the way i like it. Great Beer!","Bakewell, Derbyshire, ENGLAND","kempicus"
3608,"2008-01-26",3.3,"(On tap) Slightly hazy golden with a small, lacing, off-white head. Fantastic fresh citrus and peach aroma from the dry hopping. The body is thin and a little watery with light notes of nuts and a dry, lightly bitter finish. A truly great session Bitter. 21 IBU. 240108","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"
3608,"2008-01-23",3.2,"Ive had this one in New Zealand on my honeymoon. Visited the Twisted Hop and drank it there.

Nice bitter, fruity indeed.","Zeist, NETHERLANDS","NoiZe"
3608,"2007-08-17",4.4,"On cask at the pub. Poured a gentle hazy gold in the pint glass, and threw a beautiful lingering fluffy white head. A hint of butter in the nose offset the huge earthy and pungent citrusy hop notes. A deep draught revealed a great malt/hop balance (leaning toward the hop side of the equation), and a solid mouthfeel - impressive for a beer of only 3.7% ABV. A drying bitter finish lingered nicely, and left me wanting more. I would drink this all night long. Im not given to ""rave reviews"", but I think this is the best ordinary bitter Ive had, and Ive had many. It beats almost anything I tasted in England.","Hamilton, NEW ZEALAND","greig"
3608,"2007-07-29",3.5,"Pours a golden colour with a thick white head.  Has hints of Citrus.  Overall a great session beer","NEW ZEALAND","kinghellsfire"
3608,"2007-07-14",4.6,"Best pint I have drunk since 2003 and certainly best one here in N.Z. Very creamy head, smooth drinking and I wished I had the $$ and bootspace to buy a cask of it.","NEW ZEALAND","johninpicton"
3608,"2007-01-26",3.9,"Pint @ the pub 16/12/06. Reasonable big nose for a session beer citrus amongst others. Relatively creamy, great texture & just invites you to have another.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","bozoNZ"
3608,"2006-10-30",4.2,"feb/06 Served by beerengine with sparkler attached. Pours a light gold with a slight haze and a thick creamy sparkler driven head.  Aromas of fragrent citris hop and fruity notes, perhaps a touch of stonefruit. On the palate the citris hop notes are joined by subtle nutty malt and a gentlelasting bitterenss. An Ordinary to be proud of. I have also tasted this beer from bottle and rigger and neither compare at all to how good it is from the cask.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","OStreetBrewery"
3608,"2006-08-21",3.6,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2012 I am re-rating this one after 300 successful pints. It has all the elements youd look for in a pint. It has a fantastic aroma of Nelson Sauvin hops ( this gives it a Sauvignon Blancy aroma) it has a lingering bitterness (it is the most bitter of all the TH ales at 40 IBU) and as you approach the end of your pint, youll feel as I do the sadness at turning your back on another as you walk out the door. Take my word for it. Another pint of Golding is reason enough to endure the castigation from your boss or significant other: 4.6/5
5-11-12 This is a genuinely heartbreaking rewrite to give. I have known and love Golding Bitter for a number of years, but the pint I was given was so different from the rich, obscenely hoppy offering that marked three hundred pints of my experience that I could not in good conscience do a re-write. For example, the pint was a murky dark green without the cascade effect. It wasnt clear and it didnt have the full-blown fresh hop effect of the old Golding. It was a charming enough pint to smell with notions of fresh grapefruit peel, green hop and other handpulled elements of havoc, but it tasted easier, more mellow and with a thicker body. I cannot make the connection with the old Golding and this one Im afraid, as much as I enjoyed the pint, which I did. 3.6/5","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
3608,"2006-06-01",3.7,"Cask @ Twisted Hop.  Perhaps typical, but I was quite excited to try my first low alcohol English session bitter.  I was surprised by the subtlety of the  flavors- earthy malt and (I like Aarleks term) gentle floral hops. A very nice pint.  It was nice talking to Nigel the brewer after this fine pint.","Los Angeles, California, USA","jollyraider"
3608,"2006-03-27",4.0,"A most enjoyable and easy to dring drop.  Low alcohol but very intense flavour.  Clean and refreshing.  The only hand pumped real ale in Christchurch.","NEW ZEALAND","cybertron"
3608,"2005-08-02",3.2,"Cask.  Pale golden-copper colour.  Thin white head.  Faint dusty arojma, light spicy hop nose, thin malts, caramel and a bit of butterscotch.  Flavour is well-balanced, light malt and a bit of blackberry fruit.  Spicy hop finish.  Lingering soft bitterness.  Nice session beer.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
3608,"2005-05-12",3.3,"Handpump (sparkler) at the Twisted Hop: Hazy amber with a creamy head. Elusive aromas of earthy, herbal, woody hops. I got distinct rosemary notes here towards the end. Sweet woody flavour. Quite soft and restrained but with a nice long, gentle hop aftertaste. Wonderful soft mouthfeel and very nice to drink.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Aarleks"
