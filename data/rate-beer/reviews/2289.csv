Aroma is dark malt, caramel, yeast, dark bread, raisins, dark dried fruits, notes of chocolate, with a slight hint of cherries that I probably wouldnt have detected if I didnt know they were there.

2289,"2017-05-30",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 31, 2017 Piana dość obfita, lekko sycząca, średnio trwała. Barwa miedziana, opalizująca.

W smaku podobnie, sporo słodyczy, dojrzałych winogron, migdałów, olejku arakowego, razowego chleba, lekko winny posmak od wiśni i pestkowo przyprawowa, średnia goryczka, nieco przydługa, drażniąca.

Dried fig, orange zest and blue plum in the onset, sweet with sourish balance, medium carbo, caramelly and honeyish malt sweet middle, smooth but already a bit thinned by age, spicy hop touch in the end clinging onto the malt sweetness and even residual sugary sweetness which sticks a little bit in the throat, but is then washed away by a warming but practically non-astringent, brandy-like alcohol effect.

2289,"2016-01-05",3.9,"Aroma: sweet cherry pie aroma with a backdrop of vanilla. Maple syrup and dark car as is also prevalent and secondary for me. Hop aroma not really apparent. 
Appearance: very dark copper and hazy. Cream colored head which surprisingly dissipates rather quickly into a thin sliver. 
Taste: much less cherry and much more sweetness, reminds me a little of oven roasted sweet potatoes drizzled with some maple syrup. Moderately sweet, but I think its mostly due to the very low bitterness. There is almost no bitterness at all present. 
Palate: medium bodied on the body and pretty clean finish considering the alcohol level. Pleasantly creamy texture but not the carbonation I was expecting. Very long sensational finish.
Like many beers, Id rather drink this warmed up to about 50 degrees, but in a weather-appropriate situation. The one area I was disappointed in was the appearance, as the carbonation wasnt what I expected. The aromas and finish, however were unbelievable. A very memorable beer.","","beverage_god"

2289,"2015-05-26",3.3,"Good rich malty aroma with some oak and tart cherry. Boozy, but not in a bourbon way. More like brandy or sherry. Very nice looking dark reddish color with a dense off white head. Taste is light on dark fruit, heavy on spice, oak and black cherry. I found this to be a bit watery and muted on the flavor; perhaps that will change with age. It has the perfect amount of carbonation, but the palate is lacking in thickness and depth. Overall I found this to be so-so. Admittedly, quads are not my favorite style, but still I have had better in this category. I will be aging a few bottles, here's to hoping it improves.

2289,"2014-08-10",4.0,"Transfer from BA review on 10-28-12-
 Poured from bottle into tulip glass

 Appearance  The brew is poured a hazy ruby red brown color brew with a nice two finger white head. The head fades over about a two minute time span to leave a moderate amount of lacing.

 Smell - The aroma is of a yeasty and cherry nature. Mixed with these smells are nice aromas of a bready, sweet caramel, and a nice spicy nature. A rather tasty smelling brew.

 Taste  The taste begins rather large of a more bready and cherry flavor. As the taste advances the fruit flavor of cherry grows even stronger with some notes of a more yeasty as well as a lighter more wild sour and tart flavor coming to the tongue. Other sweet flavors of a more toffee nature then come to the tongue more toward the end of the taste. These when combined with some alcohol and a light toasted flavor leave a balanced, fruity Belgian flavor linger on the tongue as the taste commences. 

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the just above average side in terms of creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the average side. The creamy body is nice for the more yeasty and some of the fruit flavors. But yet with its carbonation the beer is still more on the refreshing and drinkable side (even at ~10% abv.)

 Overall  A quite tasty beer. A nice quad with all its fruit, yeasty and boozy flavor, but mixed with a nice but balanced cherry flavor. Very enjoyable and drinkable.","","Darkmagus82"

Strong malt backbone with sweet candied sugar, fruits. Hints of cherry tartness run through it.

The appearance was a dark brown body with light edges near the bottom, one finger foamy off-white head with some light clingy lacing that eventually spider webs a bit.
The smell had cherries up front with plums, sugar, Belgian yeast, malts, light booze really faint in the background, cherries continue to dominate as the beer warms.
The taste was sweet through all of the previously mentioned flavors and combined eloquently together.
The palate was about a medium, not sessionable - good sipper over a period of time, sticky sweet cherry aftertaste and a dry finish.
Overall, nice to get one of my whales knocked off and am glad I did because I am pretty sure Ill end up coming back to this, very good for its style and very good to me (as Brewery Ommegang really starts to grow on me), also this is a very sweet cherry forward quad in the smell, taste and mouthfeel.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

2289,"2014-03-11",3.4,"Seeing this beers stellar ratings really drives home for me that the mainstream tastes of beer enthusiasts here in the US are quite different from mine. This beer struck me as good, but didnt do it for me.

The cherries are only subtly present in the aroma, which I like. The high alcohol content is very well-masked, which is the thing I like most about this brew. Very sweet though. The carbonation is foamy and leaves the beer very quickly, leaving it a little flat, tending towards syrupy. Aroma is slightly fresh, with a bit of spice, fruit, and malt, slightly yeasty.

Enjoyable and pleasant to drink but I dont see this as an award-winning beer in my book, just a typical good strong Belgian-style ale.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","cazort"

2289,"2014-03-04",4.5,"355ml Bottle from BeersOfEurope.co.uk (£5.39):
Sweet with a solid fruity aroma that is dominated by cherries yet doesnt overpower the senses. There is some spice with lots of darker, ripe fruits. Dates and some figs feature and there is plenty of sugary sweetness & the alcohol is very well hidden too.

Amber with brownish red tinges throughout the body and topped with a decent sized, foamy beige head that is nice considering the abv. but sadly is doesnt hold all that well, turning to a single patch in the centre of the surface after a little under a minute.

Sweet with the lambic style cherries & some spice, a little sugar and various other sweet fruits and malts plus a touch of yeast. The alcohol comes through a little stronger here but again it doesnt overpower or spoil the taste.

Sweet & very well balanced with the alcohol hidden quite well, coming through just enough to give the beer a nice feel to it. The finish is dry but not overly whilst carbonation is good and the beer is smooth, creamy and frighteningly easy to drink.

Very nice beer that starts off excellent and seems to get better and better after its had a little time to settle and open up. Its smooth, well balanced and bursting with flavour. An incredible beer.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

Loved it.

Deep amber with a slight haze (been poured a few times before I grabbed it), tanned head on both my pours.

Malty molasses hit the nose and taste buds straight away, this is a true malty brew, but there is so much more to it than just a heavy hand of maltiness. Dark berries, chocolate and cherry hints are easy to find in the mouth, some people will pick up other notes with the flavours but my taste buds were aching from all the wonderful beers I was gorging on during the bottle swap and I most likely missed a few subtle esters and tastes.

2289,"2014-02-11",3.7,".75cL bottle poured into a goblet. Right off the bat, theres a very sweet aroma, mostly manifesting itself as cherry, raisin, and cranberry. As it mellows, the cranberry aroma becomes the most prevalent, the cherry takes a back row seat, and the raisin disappears. Theres also a doughiness that pops up while theres still a big fluffy head, but when the head disappear, so does the doughiness. Theres also some trace notes of banana, vanilla, caramel apple, candy corn, and cinnamon on the nose. I even thought I picked up some metal / dirty penny smells. The hazy amber / copper beer is topped by a fluffy white head that recedes slowly. It leaves a decent amount of cloudy head that laces the glass in abundance ... but its a runny lace that doesnt stick.Its a medium to medium-high amount of sweetness, but not overwhelming by any means. More of a fruity sweet than a sugar sweet - although theres definitely some sugar present. Theres a light bitterness towards the finish with a subtle, fruity tartness. This complex, full bodied beer has lots of fizzy carbonation in the mouth which lends itself to a smooth, sticky, and relatively thin texture (for the style at least). The tongue is greeted initially by roasted nutty and dark cherry combined with cranberry. There also seems to be some chocolate in there, and some hints of cinnamon from time to time. It finishes with a mellow burnt bitterness, but this fades and quickly turns to a sweet canned cranberry taste. I say canned cranberry only because theres a slight metal taste; its well hidden, but just enough to be noticeable. A nice, mild alcohol warming comes through late - it doesnt last long enough to be called the aftertaste, but it appears after I set the glass down. The aftertaste is that of a cran-apple-like juice with some fig and/or raisin notes. I definitely gave this one some extra points on aroma, taste, and palate simply due to the complexity - took me awhile to really fell confident that I knew what was going on with this one, and definitely in a curious way ... I think I just figured out the philosopher part of this one.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"
2289,"2014-02-08",3.9,"Presentation: 12 oz. brown bottle served in an oversized wine glass.

Appearance: It has a dark, deep amber color and develops a tan, one finger head. Eventually it dissolves into a ring that sticks around. The lacing is incredible, it covers the whole glass and slowly drips down. 

Smell: A sweet malt scent dominates, complemented by a strong ripe fruit note. Theres also an alcohol sting in the background.

Taste: Basically a mirror image of the nose. A strong and sweet malt taste dominates, and is accompanied by ripe fruit and cranberry notes.

Mouthfeel: Its creamy and smooth, very drinkable. It finishes dry and despite the sweetness it is not cloying whatsoever.

Big Belgian malt bomb on the nose... deep malt and caramel... dark fruits with apple and hints of cherry... Peppery with a background sweet clove.

Cherry presence is much bigger on the palate... it is pretty bright almost immediately and then moves quickly into the maltiness and then resides primarily as a tart kriek essence. Malts are not nearly as complex as the aroma... light raisin and dark toast. Personally I would like a slightly sweeter malt complexity mid palate to balance the kriek acidity and make the Belgian phenols bloom.

2289,"2013-12-09",3.3,"This strong beers taste is impacted by its high alcohol content but it seems to be a great blend of ales with characteristics of a saison and champagne. It pours a beautiful caramel brown with the sound of battery acid as it is rifled full of carbonation. That creates a head that is everlasting. This beer comes across a bit too sweet, with some spices reminiscent of cinnamon but also with a heavy alcohol overtone though it does coat the tongue well with its full body. The aftertaste is cumulative with a great lingering bitterness. Great pick to share with friends.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","MrWomey"

Moist dates set the stage for lightly spiced dough and crust, a subtle array of dried fruit with an obvious, but well balanced underlying influence of bright cherry, mild dark berry characteristics floating in the background, flavors follow with sharp esters and carbonation adding a significant edge of texture to the aroma components, some subtle alcohol and heat as this finishes out with earthy herbal-floral notes, a sweet maple residual builds to eventually balance the earthy finish, the dark berry characteristics begin taking over with warmth, the drink is a bit stark while the drying influence never quite harmonizes with the sweetness, overall this is enjoyable with solid complexity

A huge warm sweetness of caramel drizzled date, fig, and berries with a light sense of raw honey and strawberry jam flooding the senses, textures are smooth with just a touch of bright carbonation followed by a bready, crusty overlay in the finish, nose to finish is consistent and significantly smoother than the younger bottle, milk chocolate drizzled caramel apple pie seems to be intertwined with a blueberry cheese cake crumble, very nice, and significantly improved, the high rating is all about this nearly four year old bottle

12oz bottle served into a Duvel tulip.

A - Pours a purple garnet with a thick creamy off white head that acts like its the Terminator. A solid 1/4"" collar that stays forever.

S - Sweet but tart cherries, bready yeast, brown sugar, rum alcohol, raisins, strawberries.

T - Cherry and raisins bigtime. Sweet grapes, peaches, figs, strawberries, full and robust earthy malt, sugary bananas, wood

M - Moderate carbonation, smooth feel, full bodied.

This is fruit forward but everything really works together to create a well rounded Quad. Love the cherry presence, while a green banana flavor really adds a layer to the robust caramel malt.

2289,"2013-02-09",4.1,"Bottled September 6, 2012.
Appearance: The body is dark and somewhat murky with a brown hue, the way I like my quads. The head is thin and dense, but boy does it last. It settles into a thick tan coating even 5 minutes later.
Aroma: The nose is complex with a blend of flavors, banana, toffee, cherries, bready malts and a light spice. 
Taste: Big and complex, this beer begs to be sipped. The intro is very malty with dark fruits with more flavor on the intro than most beers have by the finish. The mid-taste adds cherries, brown sugar, while introducing some banana and cloves spice. The finish gets a bit bready, a tad chalky, with light cloves. This is complex and very nice to sip on.
Palate: Medium bodied to thick with a light carbonation to it.
Overall: This beer is a fantastic and complex very easily available beer. This should be on every beer drinkers list of must-try beers. One thing to note is that the yeast profile makes this very easy to tell its an Ommegang beer, whether thats good or bad is up to you.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Overall: A fine brew that is to me ""misplaced"" in category. I should re-review an older bottle in the future. Might be ""too fresh"" to enjoy thoroughly. Right now the brew stands out like a high alcohol Dubbel or BSDA. For a Quad it falls short. This bottle lacks complexity and depth.

Pours a murky reddish brown with a solid two finger tan head. Great head retention from the abundant carbonation.

Tart cherries on the aroma along with other dark fruits. Some licorice along with wood and a faint whiff of alcohol. Some sherry qualities as well.

The flavor, to me, is a little bit of a let-down. Some dark cherry along with a bit of an oxidized sherry character that clashes a little bit. Lots of dark fruit; dates and figs and a little wood. Alcohol is present throughout and I am a little disappointed it has not mellowed in all this time. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel makes this one a sipper.

Pleasant orange-brown color, somewhat lively off-white head.  Big malts and caramel on the nose, but cherries come through more as the beer warms up. The taste doesnt quite live up to the very promising aroma, but its still very refined and enjoyable. Sneaky spice notes.Like any good quad it strikes a fine balance between thick malt and complex dark fruit. Its not very alcohol-forward; whats lost in warmth is made up for by a surprisingly crisp texture (for the style) . The finish is good and tight.

This works very well as an easy-to-find Quad and as an introduction to the style. The flavors arent gut-punchingly huge or brilliantly nuanced, but good brewing technique shines through in every other aspect.  Nearing the top tier of American Quads.","","PHChikka"
2289,"2012-12-11",3.7,"The beer is a pretty shade of ruby with an inch of fizzy, beige head. A lot of cherries in the aroma, followed by Belgian yeast. Smells malty. The flavor is fairly sweet, with prominent cherry juice. Yeast takes a backseat to the sweet cherry flavor. Booze emerges more as I progress through the bottle. Overall, a good beer and one I would have again. That said, this is best only occasionally and in small doses. Cherry flavor becomes a bit cloying midway through. Interesting and worth a try.

A - Pours a clear dark red/brown body. Excellent two finger light khaki head forms. Very dense and creamy in appearance, a swirl produces some nice lacing and retention as well as some alcohol legs.

S - Cherries initially, then comes a wave of rich malts, caramel, dark candied fruits, toffee, brown sugar and spicy yeast. A touch of warming alcohol on the finish. Smooth and rich.

T - Ripe cherries, caramelized dark fruits, oak, brown sugar, and a yeasty finish. Incredibly delicious and smooth with all the right Quad notes. The finish has a light lactic twang, almost in the form of oxidation...but its very pleasant and complimentary. Mouth feel is creamy and medium bodied with the alcohol very well hidden. 

O - This is hands down the best American made quad I have ever tired. It really does compete with the big Belgian quads, and in my opinion is right up at the top. This beer is near perfect.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

2289,"2012-10-06",3.9,"A good beer, but could use a little more complexity. Not much detectable aroma, but some slight cherry on the nose. Heavy cherry flavor, but not overly sweet, which is well done. Nothing really stands out here but the cherry and it is somewhat one-dimensional. Excellent dark red color and perfect mouthfeel. Slight alcohol warmth. Good, but won't go out of my way for it. Doesn't fit the build of a quad that I expect. Dial down the cherry, please.

S-- Candied black cherry mixed in with some bread. Cherry fruitcake might be a good description on this. Slightly syrupy quality in the nose, still quite nice though. 

T-- Black cherry. Not candied at all. really sort of thin in a way. lacking the bread quality that it needs. 

M-- Get a slight amount of bread in the mouth but this is about cherry and more cherry. Starts as black cherry and changes to red ruby sweet cherry with small bit of sourness. Not that it is infected or anything like that. Finishes as sweet cherry. Has a bit of an alcohol burn to finish but the cherry sweetness does hide it a bit.

T: I enjoy its flavors and complexity...but theres something missing. I cant put my finger on it, but theres just something lacking.

This pours a dark burgundy / cherry color with a thick, off white head. Nearly opaque, but some bubbles visibly rise to the top of the glass. Decent head retention with some lace stick.

Dark fruits power the olfaction, primarily cherry. Surprisingly sugary malt on the nose as well. Alcohol is present, along with a slightly medicinal nature.

Caramel malt sweetness up front, quickly followed by sweet and tart cherries. Alcohol bursts through, and a tart cherry / medicinal flavor ends the sip. Alcohol lingers in the aftertaste. The 2008 is more mellow, with nearly no hop presence to note.

Medium carbonation, a little bit creamy in the middle as well. It loses its carbonation as it warms, although the character becomes somewhat deeper. Warming.

2289,"2012-01-24",4.3,"I split a 750ml corked and caged bottle dated 17 November 2009 with a friend. We each poured it into tulip glasses.

Appearance: Beautiful dark cherry/maroon body with light brick red highlights. Completely opaque, but some fine carbonation bubbles are visible at the edges of the glass. Forms a thick, dark khaki frothy head which retains and laces very well for a beer of the style.

Smell: Plenty of dark fruit, massive maltiness, vanilla, and a slight woody character too. A prominent sour cherry aroma provides the backbone for these fragrances. Its almost like having a fruit basket under your nose.

Taste: To describe Ommegang Three Philosophers as having a complex palate is something of an understatement. This is a beer whose palate not only is diverse in flavor, its constantly changing (an example of inconsistency being an attribute for sure). It begins with a strong sweetness of confectionary flavors, most notably caramel and butterscotch. Theres a slightly bitter, earthy rustic flavor or two as well - akin to Cracker Jack Popcorn if it were toasted (or even burnt). The beer finishes with a kiss of tart cherry. Theres definitely some sourness to it, but in that tasty candy kind of way. It lingers on the tongue, too. 

Initially, the alcohol is completely separate from the palate and is a little distracting. Its slightly dry, but also somewhat sweet and woody like a bourbon. As the beer warms the genuine palate of fruity maltiness and the alcohol blend together for a more homogenized palate. Its very delectable to be sure, and perhaps if it had been as consistent throughout this would be a perfect beer. A ""flawed masterpiece"" might be a great way to sum it all up, actually.

Drinkability: ""Smooth"" is not usually a word I would use to describe a Belgian quadruple, but its definitely apropos for Ommegang Three Philosophers. While it is certainly robust and does have some spiciness to the palate, it drinks much easier than any other beer of the style Ive ever had. In fact, while its in the mouth theres a refreshing quality to it - amazing! It goes down very smooth and the aftertaste is a pleasant tartness that isnt cloying at all.

2289,"2012-01-20",3.6,"750ml bottle in Chimay glass.  Pours amber at first then darkens to an opaque deep medium brown.  An active head dissipates slowly but leaves a film on the surface and nice lacing.  Aroma starts as a yeasty smell and as it warms you begin to encounter hints of the fruitiness.  Taste is about what you expect, a darker ale with cherry tones, and beckons you to continue drinking without being sweet.  Not really malty despite being labelled as a Quad. Carbonation is just about right, and alcohol is pretty well hidden, although there is a small bite on the front end and a bit of aftertaste.  Good stuff, would drink/purchase again.","Martinsburg, West Virginia, USA","mnoud"

I find the nose very dull: slight sweet candy cherry, plum, hint of spice, anise, orangy, slight alcohol, maple, caramel sweetness - a lot of things I have imagined here but it took work - too much work as I did not think this would be such a quiet brew. It has taken a very very long time for the aroma to evolve. Poured out a clear red amber brew with a thin tan head that leaves short lived speckly lacing. The taste has improved after a very long sit so I wont talk about the cellar temp flavours - Ive just poured the last half of the bottle in my glass after it sat in the fridge for a bit. Caramel, plums, cloves, moderate spice, harsh brown sugar, here and there pepper, drying, I can taste the cherry but it is hiding and blended up with everything else and still retains a background status.

This ommegang brew pours a dark ruby brown with a decently but not overly fluffy head, dissipates to a thin line fairly quickly.  The aroma on it is definitely sweet fruits, cherry above the others, no booze for a 9.5%.  Tastes of cherry, almost winey, up front with a somewhat weaker finish than expected.

2289,"2011-07-11",3.7,"Appearance - Ommegang Three Philosophers is very dark, not black like some breakfast stouts, but dark nonetheless. About a finger of head with an aggresive pour. Some stickage to the sides of the glass as it is swirled around.

Smell - Sweet, malty aromas with a hint of raisin and plum. Not the most overpowering smell in the world and not as strong as some other Quadrupels.

Taste - Overall, the taste was pretty underwhelming. The initial taste was a slight bitterness which transitioned into sweet near the end of the sip. With some retro-nasal breathing you could taste the raisins and plums and some maltiness. Maybe a slight caramel flavor too. Fairly complex taste.

Mouthfeel - Full bodied. Not much carbonation and very smooth. Could not feel the affects of the abv. until after I had drunk nearly the whole 750 mL bottle.

Overall - It was good, but not great. I have had better Quadrupels (from Rochefort) and better overall beers (Hopslam). The taste was very similar to the other Quadrupels, but not as strong and not nearly as sweet and pleasing near the end of the sip. I am going to be trying th Ommegang Abbey Ale next; lets hope that one blows me away.","Florida, USA","ajcobb24"

2289,"2011-07-04",4.7,"This is a glorious beer. The aroma is yeast, sugar, cherries, vanilla, alcohol, perhaps even a little smoke or licorice and more.

Growing anticipation as I bring the snifter to my lips...the taste cant possibly be everything the nose leads me to hope...at last the first glorious sip...it is! The taste has so many layers it is almost impossible to describe them all. The first is as expected, yeast and sour cherries. A fine blend that reminds me of my grandmas homemade bread and cherry pie that I used to get in trouble for stealing the first bites. Than comes dark candied fruits; plums, grapes, raisins and more cherries. It finishes with an earthy hop bite, some spicyness I cant quite identify, a hint of clove and anise, and a slight alcohol warmth. And then its back for another sip in hopes that the bottle is bigger than I thought. An amazing beer.

Pours a nice reddish brown with a light tan head that stays around at about half a finger and leaves some good lacing. Nose brings forward subtle hints of cherries along with some light caramel and dark fruits. Hints of molasses. The taste really doesnt bring much cherry flavor at all. Really, I cant detect it, and it was faint enough in the nose. The taste does bring some Belgian yeasty esters and some caramel. Good, sturdy body that is slightly creamy.

2289,"2011-01-23",3.5,"12 ounce bottle (2010 vintage [packaged on 3/21/10, best by 3/21/15]). Poured into Ommegang chalice. 

APPEARANCE: Pours dark caramel tone of mahogany/brown. Off-white head settles rapidly, leaving only trace amounts of thin foam film atop portions of surface. Plenty of sediment all throughout, which is dark straw color and about the size of salt grains. Inexistent lacing. Effervescence appears slow; perhaps slowed down by the viscosity and sediment. 

AROMA: Heavy caramel malt sweetness, some soy sauce, subtle dried tart cherry, faint hint of kriek. Complex aroma, though the soy sauce like scent was detrimental to overall aroma. Subtle alcohol on nose. 

TASTE: Thankfully zero soy sauce in the taste; unlike aroma. Huge caramel malt on the palate, especially concentrated on front of palate. Faint graininess on mid palate, though largely masked by alcohol. Unfortunately, some of the subtleties of the cherry/kriek, which seem to appear most prominently on back of palate, are masked by the slight alcohol warmth on the back of palate/finish. All factors combined, this beer is like a caramel-covered cherry dipped in brandy of the beer world. 

MOUTH FEEL: Full bodied. Velvety smooth. Somewhat viscous. Mild carbonation. Some alcohol warmth. Dry finish. Almost like a fine port. 

OVERALL: Wonderfully complex Belgian-style quad. Only negative aspect is the subtle soy sauce in the aroma. Excellent dessert beer for slow-slipping; would pair terrifically with cheese or chocolate. Definitely let this one warm up a bit. Thankfully the sediment is hardly noticeable on taste/mouth feel (ie, because from appearance it seemed this would be a chewy beer).

Tiny bubbles rising from the etching on the bottom of the Chimay glass Im drinking it from. It looks like a dream. The aroma... um, Im not sure how to say this, but it reminds me of polished wood. Theres nothing bad about this though. Its a beautiful, deep, woody aroma, with hints of cherries, plums, and toffee mixed in. The flavour is hard to pin down. Cherries are there, certainly. Some oak? Caramel, plum skins, almonds. It shifts and changes as you drink it. Full in the mouth, and amazingly complex. The finish is drying but with the memory of sweetness.

The flavor is first rate - sour cherries and floral sweetness blended with robust malt and an earthy hop finish.  Complex on the palate.  This is excellent - one of the best American examples of an abbey ale.

2/14/2010:  Ommegang Three Philosophers...  Aroma:  Lots of sugary caramelized sugar and malt with just a slight hint of cherry hiding underneath; high amount of alcohol; note of oxidation.  Appearance:  Has the color of dried dates with a red plum hue; 1-finger, bubbly beige head that quickly dissipates.  Flavor:  Sugary, chewy, caramel; sweet sugar; barely, if any cherry; quite a bit of oxidation coming out; slightly spiced apple cider; sweet breadl trippel-like bite up front; dry prune-like finish.  Palate:  Medium-full; fairly smooth.  Overall:  This beer may have cherry-lambic added, but the proportion must be quite low (25% or less?) as the cherry is pretty much non-existent; this particular vintage is probably about 1-2 years past its prime at this point (probably best 0-3 years from bottling date); overall, this beer definitely did not meet my expectations; I am fairly disappointed.

A- Body is a very hazy-almost opaque medium reddish brown hue. Pours with a relativly thin slightly off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a fine white collar around the glass. Minimal lacing is left behind.

S- Nose is strong of cherries, alcohol, chocolate, caramel, and a spicy Belgian yeast strain.

T- Upfront is sour cherries with sweet caramel malt backbone. Spicy Belgian yeast and alcohol emerge for the finish and seem to make the initial flavor disappear. All of these components linger equally-which is the highlight of the flavor. The intricate complexity of all these characters that dont usually mix together plus the addition of sweet chocolate. Its good and it really makes you think.

P- Carbonation is low and mouthfeel is mostly smooth and yeasty with hints of an alcohol slickness/burn.

O- This is a very interesting and complex brew that I do enjoy-but the blatant booziness of it all keeps the drinkability above average-but less than ""good."" This is my 5th quad and it falls in the middle of the 5 for me. I love Ommegang and their brews and through this isnt my favorite quad I will certainly have it again.

2289,"2010-02-11",3.4,"Serving: 750 ml. bottle.
It pours a murky, reddish brown color with a sizeable off-white head.  The nose is decidedly Belgian with notes of yeast, fruit, cherries, and spice.  The flavor follows the nose to some degree, but is also much lighter than expected.  The malt makes more of an appearance with some sweetness and caramel note.    There is also a greater earthiness in the taste, but it still plays a minor role.  The palate leans towards the rich side but the high effervescence helps lighten things up.  In the end I am left wanting something more out of this beer.  For all the hype, I dont think it lives up.  A Rochefort 10 or Rigor Mortis blows this beer away.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

Nose is sour brown ale like, with some fruitiness and fresh bread.

Palate is a rather ordinary sour lambic, perhaps sour brown like New Belgiums la folie, but with a modest amount of the cherry kriek in the mix. Honestly I cant figure out why this beer exists, and why it is reviewed so highly. It tastes neither like a traditional quad, nor like a good fruit lambic. Its almost as if it was a mediocre quad so they had to add the cherry lambic to offset the poor results.

Rich reddy brown, brief head. Some pleasant roasty aroma, a touch of caramel and chocolate. Gentle carbonation, smooth palate - molasses in spades in the retronasals. First taste after swallowing was definitely primarily quite hot, but followed by some lovely burnt edges, and just a touch of barky bitterness. Alcohol too prominant, alas, this really ought to be toned down a fair way to excel. Fairly drinkable though, even considering the strength. Adding some yeast made the aroma softer and more caramelly, the taste too, but also once got a tiny hint of glue in the taste, which for me is a big no-no. Strangely, I burped kriekenbier.

2289,"2009-12-04",3.8,"Location: Cant believe Ive never rated this one, anyway, this is from a 12 oz bottle that Dave brought over on 11/30/09 


Aroma: The nose has hints of nuts, dark fruit, alcohol, woodiness

Appearance: Pours an orange-amber with a nice head

Flavor: It combines the strong flavors of the nose with some alcohol tastes

Palate: The body is pretty full with some burn from the ABV

Overall Impression: 
I was drinking a bit out of a 12 oz bottle, and I realized I somehow havent rated any of the Ommegang beer, a slight oversight on my part.  Really surprised by my oversight of this nice brewery, I know Ive enjoyed a few of their beers over the years.

2289,"2009-12-03",4.0,"Complex aroma - something like raisins, detectable alcohol, and maybe even some resin. Decent head, but disappeared a bit quickly. The cherry flavors are present but well-balanced - this beer is full of flavor but the sweetness is not at all overpowering. Fantastic blend of fruits and malts. Finishes bittersweet and acidic -- red wine (Pinot?) on the way down. There is a definite earthiness to this beer. It is lively on the palate and not as heavy as I anticipated.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","joechristenson"

2289,"2009-11-28",3.8,"2008 vintage.

Dark reddish brown, almost more red than brown actually. Slightly hazy. A very big yellowish head fizzes away rather quickly but leaves stylish lacings.

The smel is interesting, but kind of hard to pinpoint. Plenty of malts, dark bread yeast and prominent notes of berries. Quite a lot of chocolate as well, herbs and grass. After a while an unusual smell of roasted and tart aromas develops. This is really a complex smell with a wide range of different components. Its slightly edgy and perhaps it doesnt make it all the way, but its still pleasant and interesting.

In the mouth, theres a nice character of sweet Belgian style dark ale in the fore, with the typical mix of powerful malts and vinous notes of cherries and other dark berries and spicy and herbal yeast. Some caramelized sugar, chocolate and grass. Faint notes of bubblegum and soft candy. In the middle, a gentle tartness develops (might this be the kriek lurking in the shadows?). The finish is slightly bitter with notes of coffee, iron and stale bread, perhaps even some hop notes. The alcohol is noticeable in a not entirely integrated way.

The body is not as big as I think I would have wanted it to be, and the lack of body results in the flavors coming out as a bit thin as well. The finish is slightly dry, whilst the mouthfeel is smooth.

An impressive tasty and complex beer which I enjoyed quite a bit. But its slightly edgy and I dont think it really manages to succeed in the ambitious task it sets up for itself.

Nice quad aroma (dark fruit, toffee, caramel, etc.) with a sweet abundance of cherries. Slight alcohol presence protrudes as it warms. The flavor is similar for the most part, but brings with it candied sugar, some light alcohol, and a slightly tart cherry finish.

2289,"2009-09-29",4.1,"Pours a deep brown with garnet tints and a super tight beige head. Aroma is loaded with fruity esters that fill the room before the first sniffs even transpire. Plum, prune, dates, raisin, caramel, toasty sweet malt, molasses, brown sugar and light fruity notes that seem to proliferate with the accompanying of some mild alcoholic warming notes. Fruity esters that showed up in the aroma make a similar impression in terms of the light fruit flavor profile. Dark fruits, however, take the day with nearly every facet making its respective way in the swirling dark sugar torrent that is so prevalent. Dark syrup like sugars are complemented nicely by a wholly evident alcohol note that warms the nasals but doesnt detract from the experience. Palate is effervescent with lots of bubbly prickling amongst a high viscosity torrent. Mouthfeel is thick and quite rich- even chewy with warming booze and an ever so slight roasty dryness. This is only very subtle, though, for the overall theme of the finish strays away from attenuation and presents itself with a sticky smacking fullness.

2289,"2009-09-01",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2009 Vertical tasting of the 2007, 2008, and 2009 batches or vintages. As it turns out the tasting went exactly as we would have expected. Heres some brief notes on each vintage.

2009 - Reddish in color. Hot, sweet, sharp fruit flavors, lacks balance. Most fruit of all three that we tried. Least favorite.

2008 - Stuck right in the middle of the two vintages. Color fading as well as the fruit. Less sharp than 2009. Better in quality but not by much.

2007 - Hands down the best of the three years that we tried. The red color has almost completely faded. Brown now in color. Malty lush nose. Fruit flavors are now faded to the point where they are very well integrated.

Conclusion - 2 years seems to be a nice sweet spot for aging this beer. The 2009 had just been released when we did our tasting. It would have been interesting to have a bottle of 2006. However, I think a 2006 would have tasted old by now.","Brentwood, Tennessee, USA","MmmcKay"

The first bottle was amazing and one of my favorites, though!","Georgia, USA","drowland"
2289,"2009-08-14",4.0,"750 mL bottle (2007).  Pours a murky mud-brown with some reddish highlights.  The high carbonation creates a medium-sized frothy beige head but quickly dissipates to nothing.  Aroma is bready malts, caramel, raisins, light yeast, and a hint of cherry from the 2% kriek.  Flavor of rich malts, caramel, chocolate, and dark fruits.  Though somewhat lacking in the nose, I do get a quite a bit of kriek in the flavor.  I dont find it as sweet as many of the other reviewers -- perhaps because it is slightly aged?  Rather light mouthfeel.  A good quad.","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"

The head was  light tan, foamy, and left some nice, clingy lacing. The aroma was sweet, with vinous and tangy fruit notes, mellowed by a light blanket of caramel. The flavor was sweet malt, wine notes as the aroma, and tangy fruit, more specifically dark cherries, with a little cranberry tartness. Cant forget the nice, warming alcohol. A fine sipper. Only got better with a little warmth. Enjoyed the 12 oz. bottle version recently at Lunar Brewing Co., and was equally impressed. A little lighter in color, more reddish amber.

Aroma is musty and filled with cherry skin right away, but the maltier scents of caramel appear along with another smell that reminds me of a barbeque sauce.  Theres a constant shifting between the cherry and the malt here, and its a pretty pleasant effect.  The taste isnt nearly as strong of cherry as I wouldve guessed from the smell, and theres a lot of sweet caramel in here.  Some sweet cherry appears mid-palate.  Only upon the beginning of the finish do I get the spike of tart cherry skin, and the finish itself imparts a taste of crushed peanuts with a bit of bread.

2289,"2009-02-17",3.7,"2008 Bottle. Pours a dark translucent caramel with a diminishing tan head. The aroma is strong of effervescent cherries with some yeasty qualities in the background. The initial flavour is sweet with the berry citrus cherries and cranberriesand some yeasty notes. The yeast notes fade a little as the brew sits in the mouth. As the brew passes, allowing the taste buds to breathe, the hops become slightly evident and the citrus bite heightens. After its peak, the citrus diminishes allowing some caramel flavours to awaken and making the yeast more evident again. The beer is pretty smooth throughout the tasting up until the finish. The finish becomes moderately dry, much like a dry citrus, with some light bitter notes. Its a delicious beer, but as a quadrupel it seems to me to be a little too sweet.
Paired with a Wenslydale (with Cranberries) cheese. 
The cheese: It is mildly sweet and initially creamy, but becomes dry towards its finish. The cranberries are almost too overpowering, though, as there are quite a bit of cranberries in this cheese. However, consuming the cheese itself, it has the perfect amount of cranberry flavour.
The pairing: As expected, the cranberries pair well with the citrus flavours of the beer. The flavour of the cheese is too mild to affect the flavour of the beer save for slightly accentuating the sweetness of the beer. But its the texture of the cheese thats the magic of this pairing. The initial mouthfeel of the beer becomes smoother as the finish no longer becomes dry. The hops in the finish is now masked with the creaminess of the cheese which also extends the smoothness of the beer into the finish. The cranberries in the cheese brings more attention to the berry citrus in the finish. I really enjoy this pairing.","California, USA","BossHossBikes"

Ive only had it a handful of times in the past, but I believe it as a more noticeable cherry taste when fresh.  Tastes like a less carbonated and alcoholic La Trappe Quad to me, which is a good thing, to capture some of the Quadrupel subtleties.

Strong sour cherry smell and taste.  Also bananas cloves pepper dark wood and funky earth flavors.  The cherry dominates more than I would prefer.  It is clear that an immense amount of effort goes into this beer.  Ommegang is an excellent brewery with a delicious yeast strain in their Belgians that is only a notch or so below the Trappists.  Now the size of that notch varies in my mind from beer to beer.  At any rate a very interesting beer that would be great for introducing to non craft beer drinkers but there is a tad too much cherry flavor for a higher rating.

Awesome tart cherry notes meshing seamlessly with a yeasty, nutty, caramelly, dark-fruity quad base, wow, what a thing of glory. Unfortunately, while the age seemed to have done wonders for the cherry aspect in the nose, the base beer suffered just a bit in the mouth, yielding a bit too much of a soda characteristic and losing some of that rich, earthy nuttiness. Perhaps a 2007 bottle will reveal the best of both worlds...10-5-7-4-14/4Rerate 1/15/09 2008. An incredible desert beer.

2289,"2008-10-22",3.4,"Another year-round staple and fine American example of Belgian brewing from the brewers at Ommegang. This time I am presented with their Three Philosophers, a Belgian quad, or quadrupel, with a bit of a different twist. Brewed with dark cherries, Three Philosophers combines the rich complexity of a Belgian quad with the sweet yet tart succulence of a Belgian kriek, or cherry beer. Only so much is made each year, so each batch has the year in which it was brewed and then bottled from. Today I get to partake of a 2008 Three Philosophers and sate the philosopher in me.

A huge head chides me to pour my Three Philosophers slowly so as to not waste her pomp and prominence, and at the same time to savor her seductive amber brown body as it slowly fills my glass. Not as dark as a traditional quadrupel, this is but one unique aspect of this brew and a beautiful reminder of the cherry which lies within. Her head slowly settles into a soft off-white blanket with a tinge of pink. Of course, with a head such as her head, brussels lace sticks all over the sides like a spider web of brewing intrigue. I can definitely smell the rich dark cherries along with sweet caramelized sugars and a tart sour nip. Caramel, nuts, and some dark fruits round out the nose. Her body is sweet, clean and smooth with a light sour puckering effect after the initial sweet impression. Mildly effervescent, I can definitely taste the cherries right away. Holding it all together is a full and subtle palate of caramel malts, nuts, dark fruits and a growing warmth from the high ABV. Sweet and tart, clean, smooth and succulent with rich dark fruits, nutty malts, and a pleasing finish. About the only improvement I can think of is a bit more of a fuller body. For a quadrupel, even considering the kriek aspect, it feels and tastes a bit too thin.

I can definitely appreciate Three Philosophers for what it is and what Ommegang has done with this particular quadrupel. It isn’t a quad I would quaff when in the mood for a traditional quadrupel, but when the mood strikes for something of a different twist, Three Philosophers can definitely fill the bill.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

But its grown on me quite a bit, as its another very well done offering from the might Ommegang. Basically, its got all the virtues one expects from a nice quad  dark pour, thankfully not thinned out too much, lively spices combining with flavors of overripe fruits, and so forth. But the addition of the cherries really adds something, not sickly sweet or syrupy, but simply a distinctive quality that makes this brew stand out from others in the style. Not something I return to very often, but I enjoy it when I do.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Pours a very nice ruby-brown, mostly clear, with a small tan head. Aroma is actually a lot like the Koff Porter we had earlier, very weird for a Belgian ale of any sort, but I guess that could be viewed as a good omen. Sweet, slightly boozy, inky Baltic Porterness, and some cherry. Very interesting smelling. Flavour doesnt disappoint either. Great complexity with the cherry lambic aspects really shine through. Tart, a touch sour, with decent malty fruity aspects showing up. I  guess you could almost call this a Quad of sorts, but I think it might be better classified under the umbrella term of Belgian Strong Ale. Pretty smooth for the abv, though the bottle is 3 years old. Surprisingly good, although I dont know why my expectations were slightly low to begin with.

Big syrupy malt nose with a sweet cherry syrup and chocolate accent.  Very noticable alcohol when you get your nose deep down in the glass.  The flavor is a bit of a mess, heavy syrupy fruity malt with a cough syrup like cherry flavor that’s only re-enforced by the prominent alcohol.  Figs, a little murky yeast and earthiness on the hot finish.  Mouthfeel is sticky and cloying with slightly overactive fizzy carbonation.  Overall, this was just pretty bad.

Different flavors from lips to gullet. Slightly tart at start, with lush caramel, oak(?) and alcohol. It’s INCREDIBLY smooth as it warms just a bit. Full mouthfeel, for sure, but I think the yeast has had enough sugar to mellow a bit and actually allow the other characters to come through.

2289,"2008-07-19",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 10, 2010 This nice treat of a beer has a lightly airy, light-brown head that mellows out to leave behind a nice, thick collection of froth around the edge of the glass and heavy, but bubbly, lacing.  Its appearance is dense and muddy, with an orangeish light-brown color and an orangeish hue.  The aroma is actually really, really good, with hints of honey, spice, fruit, roasted malt, and light alcohol and yeast.  If you think the aroma sounds nice, dont worry... so does the flavor.  Personal note: this beer actually tastes alot like a homebrew I made to celebrate the birth of my first son that was malty and highly alcoholic.  Three Philospophers is just that: malty sweet, fruity (but not sugary) and alcoholic with traces of yeast.  Im actually pretty impressed by this beer.  I suspect cherries might be whats making this beer so good.  Its dense, and the bubbles floating near the surface of the beer make that density obvious.  Its meaty, sweet and smooth.  It leaves an almost sweet/tart sensation in the mouth with a finish of warm, sweet alcohol, much like what youd experience in a double IPA, but without the IBUs.  Unlike many beers of thr Belgian style, this isnt that yeasty.  A great, well done beer that has a wonderful palate and is really enjoyable.  Im really quite surprised.  FOr such a high ABV, this is really drinkable.  I could drink this all night.  Warning, though... the yeast is much more noticeable when served at warmer temperatures, making it more of a sipping beer in those conditions.  So if youre drinking this solo, try it a little cooler.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

Well rounded taste with a great tartness of cherry at the end (and Im not a huge fan of cherry).  Very pleasantly surprised with this, recommended.","Michigan, USA","Surly"
2289,"2008-06-05",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2008 Pours a deep ruby brown with a good head that sticks around. Aroma is wonderful - sweet fruits (cherries, grapes) balanced by yeast, light malts and brown sugar. Flavor is great, too - though the sour / bitter notes hit more strongly than in the aroma. The cherries are definitely tart, and the malts taste roastier than they smell. Mouthfeel is great, but it leaves a medicinal aftertaste - like a cherry cough drop - that really started to get irritating about halfway through the glass. Other than that, this is great stuff.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

Pours deep mahogany with dark red edges, a big, frothy, off-white head on top. Wonderful duration and nice lacing. Great aroma with good overripe grapes, raisins, plums, very light roasted tones and a lingering cherry tone as well. Medium carbonation, great mouthfeel. Flavour is wonderfully complex, light cherry tartness hits me first, then that fruity yeastiness with some wonderfully balanced chocolate notes in the finish. Surprisingly dry, actually. And the alcohol is not felt at all! Gimme more!","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"
2289,"2008-06-03",3.6,"From my review @ cvillebeergeek.blogspot.com.Appearance: Deep, dark reddish brown slightly cloudy pour. Three finger head dissipates fairly quickly and makes a weak effort at lacing, leaving some thin wisps just above the surface of the beer that do not stick around very long. This looks typical for a quadrupel, but uninteresting. 3.0/5.0.

Aroma: The aroma is primarily rich malts... toffee, brown sugar and caramel. The yeast imparts notes of green apple and banana. I THINK I can smell the cherries slightly, but it may be just because Im looking for them. The aroma is rich, pleasant and typical of a quadrupel. 4.0/5.0.

Taste: Much more on the tart side than I expected. Sour cherry and funk from the lambic are definitely showing up. Some toffee and chocolate notes appear at the front and back of the tongue. I feel like the tartness is overpowering the other flavors somewhat, but this is still tasty. 3.5/5.0.

Mouthfeel: There is a slight alcohol warmth, and the beer is pretty tart. It is pleasant, though, and shouldnt scare off those that havent been exposed to the more sour beer styles. 4.0/5.0.

Drinkability: Any 9.8% ABV 750 mL bottle is a big commitment. This is a complex beer... smooth and tart, fruity and malty. It inspires thought, and in that regard I suppose it lives up to its name. 4.0/5.0

Overall: 3.60/5.00. Interesting beer. Pleasant and thought-provoking. Even at only 2%, the kriek makes its presence known. While tart, this is not a beer that will scare off beginners. If its that tart at 2%, imagine a pure kriek! Not the best quadrupel around, but at $6.99 for a 750 mL bottle (at Whole Foods Market... Chris says they/we are the cheapest), you cant beat the price. This one is definitely worth a try.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
2289,"2008-06-01",3.8,"Unbelievably smooth for 9.8%.  Definite hint of bananas upon a deep whiff and an undertone of cherries throughout the sip.  Finishes a little malty and definitely draws you into another swig.","Hackettstown, New Jersey, USA","derst27"

Its a bit alcoholic in the nose as well.  Its visual pleasing with a dark crimson color, with a thin foam head.  Its flavor is wild, very complex, but not complicated arrangement.  It takes on a charachter of cognac, with distinct oak flavor.  It also is full of dark fruits, figs, raisins, sweet malt, and some alcohol.  The feel and complexities change in the mouth to a sweet feel, followed by an oak-warming feel.

Sweet flavor of chocolate, toast, cherries, white grapes, spicy apples and smoked birchwood. Reminds me of late fall in the midwest.

2289,"2008-04-06",3.5,"12oz bottle, pours red/brown with off-white creamy head, which mostly dissipates and leaves no lacing.  Aroma is nice, with heavy malt, moderate dark fruit, and cherries.

I buy this at the grociery store down the street from me in the corked bottle.  It pours a very dark amber, with a scent of black cherries, and other glorious fruitiness.  The flavor of this beer hits you as soon as it enters your mouth and hangs around long after it has left.  Almost perfectly smooth.  Anytime I have friends over I share some of this with them and they are immediately overcome with the greatness of this beer.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","the6thnitemare"
2289,"2008-03-27",4.0,"Bottle from Total Wine, -poured into a Chimay glass. 
Handsome looking beer with a nice burnt amber color. Smallish white head. Interesting beer, the palate on this is light cause it has quite a bit of carbonation, yet that makes it more drinkable than the 9.8% would indicate. Some of the complexity of it is lost due to the carbonation though, but as it warms you get some raisin and cherries the cherry comes through more than is typical but thats to be expected because of the cherry infusion. There is a cool smoke note on the end almost like it was aged complemeted by vanilla and more cherry a tiny bit of sour funk comes through also, very welcome. A little bit of bitterness but not alot considering its an American belgian. Very classy brew from Ommegang.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"

Faint tart cherry and alcohol. Theres a flavor somewhere past all that carbonation. Its raisiny, musty, and somewhat funky. More Bernardus than Rochefort, by which I mean more size than fruity complexity. Good, but nowhere near as delicious as the best Abts. I have some 2004 bottles that are begging to be cracked, so well see how its aged.","Winchester, Virginia, USA","jmuhops"

Quite sweet with a light acid note from the kriek, which makes tis very special. Ommegang seems to have catched the belgian taste (from two belgian styles) here, in a very good way. Palate is great, very smooth and nice. Very nice abt, one of the better ones Ive tasted and it carries the alcohol very well. Balanced! Reminds me a bit about Chimay Blue.

Way too much carbonation in the mouthfeel of this one.  Taste is of booze, some cherries, some dark fruit, and maybe a little oak or something kind of woody.

2289,"2008-03-08",4.3,"The neck label indicated a 2007 bottling date, and the pouring instructions on the side of the label were helpful.  It didnt take much vigor to create a luxurious head as suggested there.  The body was deep red and brown, and the head was quite stable and frothy.  Quite a bit of lace formed each time the glass was tilted.  The smell was floral sweet with a ton of dark fruit character showing through as well.  The taste wavered between sweet and dry and finished spicy.  The blended nature of the beer was apparent in a mellow smoothness that muted some of the edgier and earthier tones found typically in Quadrupels.  The alcohol was more of a factor in the taste than I initially expected it to be, and the warmth was quite noticeable after each sip.  This was a well built Quadrupel with a lot of good facets.  None of the qualities was really best in class, but the sum was greater than the parts, as it was a nice cohesive whole.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Pours with a big, soapy head the slowly works its way down to a nice layer that sits on the beer the whole way down. Smells of candied apples, cherries, smoke, and maybe even a little beef. The taste is more mild than the nose and leans toward the fruit/malt side. When sipped slowly as it should be, the taste is quite refreshing and the alcohol completely masked. Bigger swigs definitely show the burn. Very sticky finish, as to be expected with a beer this fruity.

Aromas are fruity (maybe my mind is playing tricks, but I think I can pick up a hint of cherry), raisins, toffee and brown sugar with a touch of cloves.  Flavor starts out fine enough... sweet brown sugar malt with a bit of yeast and some dates, but then heads a little to the sour cherry side of things and ends with a little bit of alcoholic dryness that seems a little unseemly and, to some extent, destroys the plot development leading up to it.  Strangely, it seems like Im pulling a different experience out of this one with each sip, and while some of them are pleasant, some are trainwrecks where the alcohol gets in the way.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

Maybe a little woody toast?  Over time some lovely cherry begins to open up, but Its very subtle.  Sweetness develops a little bit, but the malt is very dry for the style.  Low carbonation.  Not super thick, not super watery.  Substantial, but not crazy.  It works.  Sweeter than the nose suggested, but very restrained.  Big toast.  Maybe even oak?  Im just not 100% sure.  The cherry is fairly obvious, but the sweetness is so light that this comes across sharper and toastier than I think is best for this beer.  The alcohol is well hidden.

The flavors have really melded together pretty well over time. Starts off with sour cherry, brown sugar, and spicy yeast. Earthy, oaky tannins, sweet cherry pie filling, and butterscotch on the back end of the palate. Soft and bubbly feel, although it does become a bit grating carbonation wise after a bit.

Quite a complex aroma, with a nice strong maltiness and very evident kriek influence. Standard quadrupel notes of dark fruits like raisin and prune.

The kriek manifests as a very dark black cherry flavor with a little bitterness to it. Again, the other 98% of the beer is quadrupel, so you get the standard raisin, prune, plum, dark strong malt, currant, and chocolate notes.

2289,"2007-12-29",4.0,"Aroma: Cherry is the first scent to greet the nose. Then come chocolate, prune, and vanilla. The alcohol is apparent but not overpowering. Purple raisin yet green grape scents. Lighter and more floral than the classic, port-like quad aroma. Reminiscent of brandy or sherry.  A chalky dry smell develops later. Complex, intriguing, and appetizing aroma. Yeast and cherry scents are the ones that linger upon sipping.

<P>Appearance: Pours a hazy, medium brown with a red hue. Almost burgundy or maroon in color. Many tiny bubbles race to the surface from the bottom. Moderate to large amount of beige head with a tight arrangement of small bubbles. Produces a modicum of lacing.

<P>Flavor: Grainy flavor; you can really taste the barley! Vegetal (broccoli, asparagus, avocado) and earthy. Baked or dried apple flavor. A pleasant, sharp, almost vinegar-sour bitterness in the finish. As is the case in the aroma, the alcohol is noticeable, but it is not unpleasant. Surprisingly subtle taste but in a sophisticated rather than a boring way.

<P>Palate: Lingering dry and cherry-flavored aftertaste. Light to medium body, much lighter than I expected. Soft, smooth, and borderline oily in the palate.

<P>Overall: Brewed in 2006. Poured from a 25.4 oz. bottle. Three Philosophers reminds me of a Cabernet Sauvignon wine, as it is fruity, meaty, and hearty with a dry finish. It is just what I needed after tasting several disappointing, lackluster beers in the last few days. I was close to giving it a 9 for flavor, and this is a balanced, complex, and solid beer across the board, so Ill give it an impressive 17 overall score.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

The flavor is mild in terms of the Belgian yeast, but spice and dark fruit (raisin and cherry) came through.

The dark brown ale really comes alive with a great head when poured and the distinct aromas of apples and champagne mixed with dark malts invited me to the taste. Sweet caramel and baked fruits for a pie came to mind with a hint of hops in the aftertaste. I barely noticed the 9.8 abv as the dark ale really took me by surprise. A great selection for me.","Jacksonville, Florida, USA","bonbright7"

Wonderful fruity aroma, almost as if it was actually brewed in Belgium.  But the smell isnt quite as strong as some others, it smells great, you just gotta get your nose down in there and root around a little.  Nice medium palate that feels alive on the tongue.

But it may just be the style I dont like, not necessarily this particular beer. Its so thick and syrupy. I know its sacrelige, but I had to cut it with some water! Ugh, its just so sweet and strong. Its too much. I think its making my stomach a little uncertain. Same thing last night. I dont want the other two in the four pack. Kudos to them for going for it, but its just too much for me.

It wasnt thin or vinagery like many high alcohols. The flavors are complex, but it does taste more like a belgian strong than a Abt. There are less fruit sweet notes and more yeasty malty notes. Either way, very complex.","Maryland, USA","Skeegle"

Big head of medium to small bubbles that quickly fades to wisps on the surface.  Deep read amber color.  The aroma is mild, and I want to say I smell a little bit of Brett.  The taste is very dry, like a brett beer.  Sourness is very mild as if just a bit of sour cherry juice was added. I only drank a little, then drank the rest the next day.

So many smells in there they jumble together - all that stuff overpowers any malts or hops noticed in average ales.  Thick consistency, but highly carbonated leading to a curious combo.  Despite its floral / fruity aroma this beer has many ale-like qualitites, malty then cherry comes out.  Finally, the alcohol makes its play in the end.  A satisfying journey.","Florida, USA","TheBeerBaron"

In the background theres prune, ripe pear, brown sugar, alcohol and chalk. Head is frothy/fizzy, brown with fair lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is a hazy red/brown. Balance in flavors is almost perfect and each component unfolds nicely into the others. It starts moderately sweet and lightly acidic then finishes lightly sweet, acidic and bitter. Palate is medium to full, chewy, between oily and creamy with a carbonation between lively and fizzy, and it finishes dry in the mouth and sticky on the lips.

2289,"2007-08-15",3.4,"2005 bottle thanks to David!  Poured a slightly hazy medium orangey-caramel with a rather well-retained cap of beige head.  The aroma was sweet and on the dusty side, with some cherry dust, toasty caramel malts, a bit of spicy yeast, and some enhancement from the booze-factor.  The flavor had toasty chocolate, caramel, and dried, very sweetened cherries.. left a sweet caramel and cherry finish accented by a hefty booze factor.. didnt enjoy it too much.  Wanted to be heavier in the body, but the dried cherry undertones made it a touch slick.. heavy booze-laden caramel and cherry dust rode through the finish, leaving a sharper, yet well-sweetened cherry finish.  OK all-around.. not really good, though.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

The aroma is malty, smells of dust, some alcohol and licorice. Medium bodied with that nice fizzy light carbonation that never seems to stop. Flavor has some light cherry notes and with the warmth of the alcohol reminds me a touch of the old cough syrup. It has some brandy notes and red wine flavors. Has a mild sweet and alcohol finish, with a fairly yeasty note hanging in there. Some tartness as well in a slightly cherryish fashion I guess. Its not entirely interesting but its quite good.

2289,"2007-08-12",2.3,"Looks like murky sewage and V8.  Reddish brown pour with no head,  floating chunks, and overall not appealing.  Smells like a heller bock.  Sweet sour maltiness but with a hint of alcohol as well.  As it warms it smells a bit more of rubbing alcohol.  Not a terribly appealing smell either.  Taste is really rather dry, muddy and bland actually with alcohol definitely noticeable but ive had stronger alcohol tastes in less alcoholic beers.  Cherry isnt really noticeable, but maybe comes through it the tartness rather than big cherry flavor.  Reminds me of a cross between beer and wine.  Like a carbonated wine almost.  This isnt awful, but I dont see it being anybodys dream beer as its story and creation indicates.  The best thing about this to me was that it didnt have the awful belgian yeast taste and smell that I really abhor.  I actually liked it better than I thought I would, and it grew on me a touch.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"

The body is medium full with lively carbonation and a refreshing dry texture. The flavor was ever so slightly sweet (not nearly as sweet as I was expecting).

Decent lacing noted.  Aroma was heavy on brown sugar and rum soaked dark fruits.  The flavor had that same brown sugar malty backbone, but the fruits became a bit more defined.  I picked up some dark cherry, some fig, and some raison.  I also got quite a bit of bread pudding, which lent some smoothness to this brew.  The alcohol is noticable, but not unpleasant.  A little sweet for me, but its not just an avalanche of sugar like many are.  There is actually some substance behind its sweetness.

2289,"2007-07-06",3.2,"THOUGHTS: Not the best quad flavors and aroma, but a really nice beer. A lot of cherry flavor but not in a sickening sweet juice way. Rather light and easy to drink for a quad. Packed with flavor but not much aroma. Every time I drink this it seems a little diferent. I liked the aroma but it was very weak and one-sided. Highly carbonated, which led to quite a few burps. More malt flavor came out as it warmed.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, dark red with a small to average creamy, off-white head that fully lasted and left excellent lacing. The aroma was lightly malty and yeasty but mostly cherry. The initial flavor was light to moderate sweetness, while the finish was heavily sweet with a short duration. The medium body was dry with fizzy carbonation and the finish was a little metallic and moderately alcoholic.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

There is a bit of alcohol flavor, which lends to a medicinal quality to the darker cherry notes.

Definitely a hint of the alcohol.  Pretty much a lot of fruity sugariness, alcohol, and then the bitterness.  Not exactly very subtle or complex.  Fairly full-bodied, but a bit thin for the style.

2289,"2007-05-19",4.1,"Murky reddish-brown beer, thin khaki head. Sweet aroma. Initial sour taste, then the usual quad sweetness. Candi sugar, plummy. Boozy cherry finish, if that makes sense. Good quad, yet alcohol and candi sugar still too apparent. Now, if youre really looking for it, you can kind of see some ""cherry lambic"" influence, but otherwise there isnt really anything particularly identifiable as lambic, which might have been nice (or it might have been a disaster, who knows). Anyway, Id really like to cellar some of these for a few years.","Medford, Massachusetts, USA","minch25"

Cloudy brown appearance and has a creamy thin lightish blanket for a head. The taste is wet woodlike and strong. However, you would not think of it as high alky. This is much more mild and well behaved for 10 percent. Lower carbonation. Has a winish initial impression that leads to rotten fruity. Smooth without allot of offensiveness. Medium to thin lacing.  If this wasnt so intoxicating, I would almost say it was watered down. Very deceiving, cannot taste the alky after a few sips, must numb the taste buds. Cannot detect the lambic within.  Somewhat creamy at times. Interesting, dizzying and complex.  More manners than Weyers.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

This beer pours a nice color that resembles a fine mohogany. The head is like a fluffy cloud that sits atop a cherry sky. The aromas are chock full of malty sweetness, cherries and raisins can be detected along with caramel and other sweet malts. The aroma alone is enough to satisfy. The intense flavor is bursting with sweet malts complimented by cherries. Overall this beer is very smooth and drinks easily with much satisfaction.

2289,"2007-05-03",3.8,"Pours a very dark ruby with a tint of brown and a very thick, porous tan head. The head starts tight and thick and slowly gives way to larger bubbles until left with a thin, speckled foam - but the bubbles arent quite large enough to be called soapy. The aroma first hits with tart cherries and alcohol. Then it hits with malts, yeast, soft fruit (banana), and more alcohol. The beer starts off sweet and malty with a hint of sour fruit. The middle of the tongue picks up more soft fruit, malts, tart berries, and more alcohol. The Belgian character shines in the middle - lots of soft fruit, peppery malt profile, flavors of toffee, and just a hint of funk (brettanomyces I think). The finish is strangely dry and dusty (more brett?) with flavors of malts, roasted grain, and hints of cherries. The after-taste is sticky and sweetnsour on the back of the tongue (caramel-covered sour cherries), and it causes burps that taste like sour cherries, alcohol, and the dust off of an old, unread library book (not that I really know what that tastes like - but thats the image I get in my head when I try to identify the flavor). Though the alcohol is definitely noticable - in aroma, flavor, after-taste, and the quick buzz - the beer doesnt taste ""boozey"". The mouthfeel is medium in body and nicely lightened by the tight and soft carbonation. Overall, a very interesting beer. I dont think Id call it my ""dream beer"" (as would Noel Blake who, in essence, designed the beer), but it is very good.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Poured into Ommegang goblet
2005

Three Philosophers poured a muddy copper. Bright ruby highlights when held to the light. There was 1 finger off white head that faded fairly quickly to a light sprinkling of foam along the top. Looks like it will be very flavorful. Kind of mysterious and inviting. I cant wait to see what flavors will come out of this.

When I popped the cork I smelled the bottle and it smelled exactly like a chocolate covered cherry. When poured into the glass a lot more scents came along. I still smell the chocolat although it did die down slightly. Theres damp soil, spice from the yeasts, a sweetness, and cherries coming through faintly at the end. For some reason every now and then Ill smell it and get scents I associate with a spiced cider but only occasionally.

The taste is really good. Theres so much going on its hard to describe but Ill give it a shot. There is a punch in the mouth right up front which quickly mellows into all kinds of flavors. Im picking up sweet malts, an earthiness/musty, spice, chocolate every now and then, and cherries. I pick up something new with every drink. As it warms theres a touch of alcohol. Just enough so it warms your throat. Very complex.

The mouthfeel is perfect. Velvety and creamy. A nice touch of carbonation. Hits quickly and vanishes. Coats my mouth and is slick as I drink.

Drinkability is ridiculous. This beer is so smooth and so easy drinking for a 9+%.

2289,"2007-02-23",3.5,"Deep, yeasty-hazed reddish-brown pour, with an initial froth head, diminishes to a mere ring.  Alcohol, vanilla, a definitive cherry lambic and confectioners sugar to the nose.  I was honestly expecting more malty substance to this, instead of relying on a thin palate of (close to cloyingly sweet) malt with a cherry lambic back.  What is supposed to register as a complementary flavor palate instead ends up contradicting itself somewhat, ending with a hollow and unfinished character.  The vinegar and peppered alcohol finish, which isnt terribly out of character for the rest of the offering, leaves me somewhat like the rest of the brew, non-satiated.  Again, the fruity esters, mild sweet malt (muddy and indistinct) and alcohol are present, but Im afraid the substance of palate just doesnt live up to my expectations.  I would feel somewhat remiss giving a ""higher than deserved"" rating, just because this happens to be a higher ABV brew, and released by a decent brewer.  Not a terrible beer at all, mind you, just a bit out of balance and lacking of substance for the style.","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"

Fortunately, the yeasty-ness of this beer balances out the initial sour-sweetness beautifully. While other raters have argued that this beer lacks complexity, Im very unconvinced. For me, there are a few key elements -- Kriek flavor, sourness, and a hoppiness that remaines throughout the taste -- and these flavors create an exceptionally balanced beer.

Nose is somewhat subdued for a quad, but very pleasant; notes of rum-soaked-cherries, carmelized raisins, brown sugar, plum, and slight yeast and oak.  Flavor is interesting and wildly unique; its almost like the lamic and the quad are competing, but somehow the flavors are unique enough to make it all worth while.  Cherry is prominant but never overpowering, other notes of carmelized raisin, tart cherry notes, more oak than the nose would have suggested, slight herbal, light sourness, light coffee notes, maybe some toasted grain.  Palate is medium full, very lively, and prickly and a little syrupy in texture.  Finshes average length and mostly sweet with more oak, tart cherry, and the herbal/earthy funky bitterness of the lambic.  Good solid beer, with intriguing qualites from the cherry lamic and the quad.

Vinous and port like, sweet with dark fruit, but the addition of cherry lambic creates a weird funkiness, a sort of sickly tart quality. Hard to describe, but sort of ""rotten"" lingering in the middle. Its not overtly cloying however, and doesnt spoil the drink, but is still a bit off-putting. Quite boozy as well, but this could have to do with the fact that bottle is still quite young. Palate is okay. It would probably improve well with age, but I wont know because this isnt something Ill likely pick up again. Certainly not bad, just not my thing.

The flavor was a big disappointment though - an initial sweetness that hinted at classic Belgian ale, with a touch of cherries, followed by a brief tartness - but then it settled into an unusually bitter finish that seemed very out of place.

2289,"2006-12-14",4.2,"Beer pours a dark ruby brownish color. With a half inch head that has good retention. Beer looks good just in the glass.
It has a sort of a ""wine"" smell to the nose. There is some fruity undertones with the obvious representation of alcohol.
Taste is incredibly creamy and smooth with a good amount of carbonation in the mouthfeel.
There is a good amount of cherry coming out midway through the taste. This is a really good beer. The alcohol was quite apparent in the nose, but nowhere to be found in the taste. Absolutely no burn.
This is a fine offering from Brewery Ommegang and at a price point that makes it a very easy buying decision.

It has a nice 2 plus finger head that has a creamy color, and sustains rather well.  Most of the sweetness comes from the cherry lambic and caramel malts, but there is a hint of citrus.  The sweetness is offset by the bitterness of the hops, which is not overwhelming, but balanced.  As I was about halfway done the caramel seemed more apparent, but your nose would be buried in the glass with the nice aroma of the cherries.

Really, it is an excellent imitation, with a very strong taste (I think it was the strongest beer I had tried to that point) and an intensely complex flavor. Poured it and a huge head came up next to a nice and dark body. Definately had a really fruity flavour (more so than the other beers of this style that I tried), apparently it is mixed with a lambic, so that would explain it.

2289,"2006-10-23",4.2,"12 oz. bottle - Stumbled into this one at a local  homebrew shop where they had a few in a fridge (set at 50ish temp).  First taste you have is of belgian ale, which is what Ommegang is known for. The label indicates its mixed with cherry lambic. There is some flavor of cherry lambic, but not what youd expect if it was a full on lambic with no ale added to it. The lambic nose can be found in the glass. Very fine head that mainatins a bit even after starting to drink it. Cloudy beer. It had been i my fridge for a couple of weeks so it shouldnt have been much in the way of shaking it up and there was a fair amount of yeast still in the bottle. Nice ruby color. Alcoholly aftertaste on the pallate as would be expected of this beer, which lingers with a light raisin-apple flavor. I can see how someone might consider this their ""dream beer."" I like Belgians and every once in awhile (due to cost) I enjoy a lambic. Mixing the two together is pretty cool, especially since it was though of by a homebrewer!!

Cherries and other dark pit fruits are noticeable, as well as a decent kick of alcohol and a faint malty backbone.

2289,"2006-09-02",4.4,"The presentation is a classy 750ml corked and caged bottle. Cleary dated 2004 across the top label.

Appearance: Pours a dark orange brown plumby color. It is hazy in appearance. A little light might squeak through but it not transparent at all. Id call it barely translucent to nearly opaque. A light tan head fades quickly.

Smell: Sugary! Dark! The smell is really good. The first thing that hit my nose was a brown sugar followed by a dark fruit smell. There is a subtle yeast hint in the aroma and in the taste as well.

Taste: As in the smell the taste is sugary sweet but not over sweet. Its just right. After the brown sugar maple syrup flavor there is a fantastic plum mango apricot sweet fruit taste that slides so incredibly smoothly across the palate. There are also hints of yeast, apples, caramel, black cherries (and dark fruits in general). The malt character is very bold and defined and the hop character is pleasantly gentle and barely showing itself through the sweet sugar aftertaste. 

Mouthfeel & Drinkability: This is remarkably smooth and enticing. The mouthfeel is a medium bodied somewhat slippery and superbly easy to swallow. It is a highly drinkable beer. Each sip is such a treat for the palate (taste) and the mouth (texture). However you must be careful! The 9.80% ABV will sneak up on you like an evil bastard and next thing you know the bottle is empty and cant remember you own phone number :)
That problem is not always a bad thing but wow this is a freaking awesome beer! I highly recommend!!

What puzzled me most though was an odd, off tasting finish that lingered at the back of my mouth.  Were my taste buds screwy that day or my bottle a little off from age/improper storage (I dont have a cellar)?  I dont know.  I guess Id have to try another bottle sometime.  The finish notwithstanding, this is a good beer, but Id heard such strong word of mouth on it that I was expecting a really great beer.  Like stoutlover72, I didnt think it lived up to the hype.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"

2289,"2006-08-17",3.5,"Rated 05 bottle - While this beer was tasty, I had much higher expectations due to word of mouth with this. Its sort of like getting geeked up to watch a summer movie youve been waiting to see only to finally watch it and wonder why the hell were you so geeked up in the first place. Aroma was malty, sweet, cherries, and some nutmeg. Appearance was like black cherry puree with a nice fluffy head with great lacing. Mouthfeel was just okay for me, nothing extraordinary and nothing inheriantly wrong but I did think it was over-carbonated for my tastes. Flavors were cinnamon, cherries, green apples, malts and slightly peppery. I felt comparitively speaking for a quad it should have had a much richer profile, but it didnt carry that at all. Overall, a good beer but I just didnt find it extraordinarly good.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"
2289,"2006-08-16",4.2,"This was really good. Poured from the bomber to a reddish brown color with off-white head, that lingered and left very good lacing. Aroma was strongly cherry, with malty sweetness evident. Body was medium, and at first, highly carbonated. Taste was more of the cherry, mixed well with the traditional ale taste. As beer warmed, the alcohol became more evident in the nose and taste, but still well blended with the cherry ale. Excellent warming finish as the alcohol took hold, and a very smooth after-taste. I will look for more of this in the coming winter.","Dacula, Georgia, USA","kimcgolf"

Light aroma, but I did detect some cherry, banana esters, a small maltiness and that all too familiar Belgian yeast thing.  Very dry in the mouth.  Like a nice dry wine.  I get some cherries (obviously), as well as a bit of astringency.  The flavor started to take off as it warmed, but by that point, the glass was almost empty.  I guess Ill learn for next time ...  Anyway, as it warmed, other dark fruit (fig, prune) joined the party, and the dryness faded a bit, and as a whole, became a little sweeter.  Very malty toward the end.

2289,"2006-04-14",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 27, 2006 Bottle. Pours a cloudy cider brown with a very small, quickly dissipating white head. Initial aroma very sweet; condensed milk, pear, slightly funky raisins. Flavor is very sweet. Red apples, pears, blueberry, fig, date; but there is a slight bitterness in the back ground...like apple skin, or dry lemon zest. After taste is where the light bitterness becomes more assertive: Granny Smith apple skin, hazelnut (?). Feels a bit thick in the back of the throat afterward, with the mouth feels clean. Decent body, feels heavy in the glass, but not as creamy other Belgian Triple and Quadrupels Ive had before. Distinct lack of that rotten fruit kick many Belgian Abbey style beers have gives this one a distinct drinkability others lack. Like drinking an orchard.

Leathery bouquet with a bit of a musty smell, along with some rochefort cheese.  Thick, syrupy texture with some hints of brandy.

Aroma: Big belgiany phenol that smells has a little bit of a thick banana smell. Slight citric tart bite that hints of cherry and lime.

a bit, a heavy toffee presence was easily detected.  The brew pours with a nice stout-ish
cascade that blooms into a tall frothy tan head with excellent retention and good lace.  The
brew is a cloudy dark ruby.  The flavor has such nice depth and balance that the high ABV
is totally incognito.  The flavor is again somewhat different for the style probably because

2289,"2006-02-25",3.7,"From the bottle.
Pours a relatively dark red-brown; the beer offers a nose of cherries, vinegar, vanilla; like cotton candy. Some alcohol comes forth in the aroma too, of course,  and the tiniest hint of bitter cocoa flirts on the nose. the flavor is darker, chewier than the aroma suggests, rich with molassas and raisin, winter spice and belgian yeast, like Swedish glog. Cherry liqueur comes on late and is then a reasonably dry woody whiskey finish given the sweetness of the initial flavor. Rather to my initial surprise, the beer lacks anywhere near as much of the sour fruit lambic flavor complex  as I had expeceted. The alcohol is highly prominant throughout.

2289,"2006-01-27",4.7,"Three Philosophers is a Quadruple by style, which is a very strong, malty, rich, flavorful beer style, that was invented by Trappist monks. What makes Three Philosophers unique for a Quadruple, is the fact that this beer is blended with a portion of Lindermans Kriek an imported Belgian Lambic beer, that is conditioned with cherries. So what you have is a very strong, very malty, complex beer, that is made even more special with the addition of some kriek. Marketed in beautiful caged and corked 750ml brown bottles, Three Philosophers retails for $7 a bottle, and is a beer that should not be missed by any beer lover. 

Three Philosophers pours to a beautiful, deep ruby red color, with a thick and creamy head and a lively amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is fantastic with heavy aromas of sweet malt, paired with spicy yeast notes, and peppery alcohol. The palate is firm and hefty on the tongue with big sweet/candy malt flavors, paired with a touch of sweet/sour cherry flavors. This cherry character works very well with the sweet malts, and along with the carbonation, balances out the malt sweetness, that alone might be a bit cloying. Three Philosophers finishes with more malt and cherry character, then ends with a spicy/earthy yeast flavor, and alcohol heat that lingers on the tongue. 

This is a very, very impressive beer. Coming in at 9.8% abv, it packs a real punch and should be enjoyed in a wide mouth chalice or goblet to really enjoy the complexity of this beer. Sip and savor this one as an after dinner drink, or a nightcap to go with a good movie or book.

While this wasnt my favorite beer of all time, it was a new experience that I think will grow  on me over time. This beer poured a murky dark rust color with a fairly small tan head that quickly became a ring around my glass. Aroma of sour cherries, ripe fruits, caramel, and malts. Tastes bitter at first with some sweetness and the cherry flavor coming out more towards the finish. The finish is a litlte bitter and has an alcoholic cherry taste as if savoring the end of a cherry cordial. Stylistically, the beer seems a bit like a chimera, but it works.

2289,"2005-12-25",3.2,"The description got me excited to give Ommegang one more chance after two disappointing experiences with the brewery. Quadrupels and lambics are two of my favorite styles, but their combination sounded audacious. I was hoping for a good surprise, while staying suspicious of Ommegangs unashamed demeanor. A fluffy custard head lightly topped the dark bordeaux body in an admittedly majestic fashion. The aroma of Griotte cherries emanated from the glass and with closer inspection revealed subtle notes of figs, dried fruits and pine with an underlaying sweetness of brown sugar and caramel. Quite pleasant to the nose. The flavor however is obliterating of alcohol and sourness that clashes with the bitter roasted coffee finish. While I enjoy the complexity and individual flavors, this fusion is entirely unsuccessful to me. It seems that this sour cherry flair should have been incorporated more conscientiously rather than what seems like a crude mélange of two very different beers. I dare say this might be the last nail in the coffin for me and Ommegang who continue to leave me unimpressed with their underwhelming products.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Nose is sweet and fruity, mostly dark fruits (as a quad should be) but with a slight overabundance of cherry. This beer gets considerably better and more complex as it warms, but the flavors seem to actually diminish in intensity. Flavor is mostly dark fruits - raisin, fig, date - until the finish. Then you get the zing of sour/tart cherry. Finish is pretty clean. This should get MUCH better as it cellars, but even now, I really like it. An interesting twist on a classic style.","Virginia Beach, USA","Immy"

I have to say that I was kind of looking forward to this one; it sounded like something special.  Overall, its not bad (which means its not great either and therefore nothing special).

2289,"2005-12-14",3.4,"UPDATED: SEP 16, 2007 Joke: what do you get when you put three philosophers together?  A confused treatise?  A sophisticated debate?  Clash of ideologies?  No, no, and no.  You get a horribly transmogrified beer whose utter lack of flavor blending leaves the drinker in stylistic revulsion.  The Three Philosophers beer from Ommegang is some kind of Frankesteinian beast, with half of a sweet Kriek like taste hanging from the left and a bread compound of flavors dangling, pendulous, on the right.  One could garner the same effect by sipping an Oude Kriek and then sipping an IPA.  No, I dont want the two of them in a single beer.  And even if I did Id want to see them blended together and mixed to make something new.  Instead, Ommegang took two distinct flavors and put them on either side of a plexiglass wall to gawk at each other.  Mary Shelleys book is getting a bit oldmaybe we need to find a new Modern Prometheus.  The dirtied red color of this beer would be a nice change of pace from the stereotyped macabre green of your marketable Frankenstein, and the smells of cherry mixed with an odd temperate rain forest aroma would be a refreshing turn from the monstrous stenches common in movies.  Best yet, the bifurcated and divided flavors perfectly reflect the image of a hideous monster, sewn together by a crazy (and ultimately unimaginative) mad scientist: Dr. Ommegang.  This beer isnt so wretched that it can be given a trip to the drain, but the disappointing and nebbish attempt to blend flavors inures the palate.  In other words, you learn to live with the abomination.  As for me, I wont be going out (with pitchfork or what have you) hunting for this beast anytime soon.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

I like how this beer compares with the normal, ""red"" Ommegang; its not as sweet, and I dig the sour in this beer. The high alcohol was enjoyable as it cut through some of the heaviness.

Theres a nice bitter kick at the end which seems to be a combination of three things, oak, alcochol and plain old bitter hops.  My only qualm about this beer might be that while it resides on the sweet side of things (even w/ that woody bittereness) the mouthfeel is a bit too thin to suit it well.

Aftertaste is good, but there are a few pesky esters and odd flavors, most noticibly nyquil and anise, on the palate. Nice beer, and I believe its style percentile ranking of 60% is deserved. Nice beer to have for #600! Purchased at Chevy Chase Wine & Liquor in Washington, DC.","Cochabamba, BOLIVIA","JonR888710"

The aroma was quite complex.  the sour kriek lambic was in the forfront, but the bunt-ish brown sugar was quite evident.  They all played well together in the flavor of the beer also.  In the palate, you get the soft and smooth sensaton of a Belgian ale, with the sour astrinency of the lambic.  This was the 2005 vintage.

Taste mos def not as sweet as the nose - initially slightly sour, then sweet and yeasty malt, a touch of hops, a very definite evergreen component, and again, the alcohol is assertively there.

2289,"2005-07-25",4.2,"2005 - Muddled dark candy bar brown with a slight glow about the edges. Awesome cap of yellowed creamyness sits about an inch high and seats itself there for quite a long time. Once its quaffed a bit, it tends to keep a very thick, firm, and whipped creamy topping. Lacing in hole-lined sheeting.

Aroma of dark floral cherrys, crisp peeled willow bark, and some caramel. Very light noting of chocolate cookie dough.

Inticing taster. A flavor ride of a treat with a big malt base of dark caramel, darker toffee, and mild molasses sliced with dark cherry liquids, dates, and figs. Malty and slightly creamified doughy center with lovely wild yeast drying effects creating a fresh bark backing and green leafy floral-like spice. Dustings of chocolate float around and mingle with delicate, alluring coatings over the dark fruityness and caramel.

Feel works quite well with the flavors, fairly full and rich with a bold and fluffy carbonation wrapped in a mild dryness and subtlety. Malt loaded creamyness ensues within and behind each sip making for one easy quaffable quad. Damn good stuff! The 9.8% doesnt seem to show up anywhere but in the last areas of the 750 once youve finished your first glass and into the second.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Dr Pepper, Tootsie Rolls, cough syrup again, anise, tobacco, burnt sugar, cocoa nibs. Mouthfeel is fluffy and tannic. At first, the aftertaste is sweet/sour with grapeskins, pit fruits, and an alcohol sting. Later, its more raisins and scotch. In fact, an apt all-around description for the beer would be scotch and cherry coke. Doesnt taste at all like beer. I can appreciate the complexity, but cant say I necessarily enjoyed it.

Flavor was malty sweet and fruity: cherry as described above, other dark dried fruits, and a bit of banana.  Also very spicy: clove, allspice, and pepper.  The kriek was very subtle and complemented the beer well.  The malt profile also had a bit of roasted nutiness as hinted by the deep brown color but very slightly.  No real noticable hop presence other than a mellow bitterness that Im sure is from some early addition hops that balance the beer out some.  Finishes dry with lingering spice.

The taste is a bit bitter up front with prevalent alcohol, with a lightly sweet raspberry middle, the end actually has a little bit of a buttery roastiness that trails off into a light dryness.  The only weakness is the obnoxious prevalence of alcohol in the beginning.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","KarmanGhia"

Taste is lightly sour with some underlying cherry sweetness. Eases into a fruity maltiness with alcohol flavors underpinning all of this. Some port flavors in there too. Lots of flavor and complexity. Almost like two beers at once (oh yeah, it is!)

Classic estery belgian-style nose where fruits and yeasty pleasure is abundant.  Sweet cherry and a touch of alcohol in there as well.  I dig the light, subtle use of cherry lambic in the flavor.

The alcohol is more present in the aroma than in the taste which feels like a complex mix of spices, malts and yeasts.

This beer resembles the St. Bernardus 12 but has less of a head.  The aroma is very malty with chocolate, cherry and toffee.  The taste is fine but the cherry medicine like taste is a little overdone.  You also get this nice champagne feel which works better here then in the Avery Reverend.

It gets better with some warmth, but it never materialized into anything Id consider top shelf.  It doesnt have what I want in a quad and, unlike other Ommegang products, it doesnt feel all that Belgian.  Its a decent beer, but I expect more from this style.

Huge bursts of sweet malt dominate the nose while notes of cherry nicely settle this beast. A playful sour lambic character dances through both the aroma and the palate creating a remarkably diverse beer drinking experience. Flavor starts off typical for a Belgian style ale, lots of peppery notes and malty goodness. Cherry, sour notes, and alcohol quickly take over and steer the palate towards a mind blowing lambic-style finish. Overall, I can describe this beer in one word...OUTSTANDING!

A very complex aroma rises out of the glass the smells of sweet fruits, caramel malt and the cherry lambic can be detected as well more so when it warms. There are also trace amounts of alcohol and spice in the nose as well. The taste starts of with the sweet caramelized malts with fruits such as apples and cherries coming through. The finish has a good earthy hop flavor, slight alcohol with a lingering cherry taste. There is so much going on in the taste I will need to pick up a few more bottles to fully appreciate this tasty brew. Mouthfeel is full and creamy with a coating light fruit sweetness that is amazing. This is defiantly a sipper but I could sip this all day provided I had no plans.

Aroma has notes of concord grapes, plums, tobacco, tart cherries, ethanol, mossy/earthy yeast notes and of course, plenty of sweet caramel.  Flavor starts out quite dry, moderately sour and really strikes me as more of a flemish sour ale.  Though it dosent have nearly the bittersweet/sour flavors, it also dosent have the huge sweet malt profile of say, rochefort 10.  A bit of a burnt cherry/ light acetone feel towards the finish, lots of strong alcohol flavors and seems like cherries soaked in extra strong brandy.

2289,"2004-08-17",4.3,"after unseating the plug on this bottle of 2003, a good hollow sounding mini-boom was heard -- not unlike the sound of dropping a large baby on formica. the foam was immense, but as uneven and dingy as a flop-house mattress,  and its big frantic bubbles would only lace for a moment before scattering like pigeons.   trying to sniff this much foam makes one feel like a house plant, cause its all carbon dioxide, which has a celery-like smell-- and naturally, sodapop. once the foaming action has subsided to a thin creamy wafer, i can surmise that the brewers blend of a belgian dubbel with cherries was judicious-- it is by no means overbearing: just pour a bit of kirschwasser over dutch chocolate cake, maybe strawberries dipped in warm caramel, or a cherry-vanilla ice cream shake doused with rum. and though im a vegetarian, i can appreciate the likeness to a raw beef steak smothered in a sweet orange and tamarind chutney marinade.  in no time the carbonation -- to the tongue-- is almost soft enough to run barefoot over, and a smoothness of palatte is the result. you get the basses and tenors in synchronized and harmonious chorus, the dark sweet malts and clarion tinny bitters in an accord orchestrated by beethoven. a bit of yeast, but little of the grating sourness id associate with a lambic. full bodied and nearly creamy as it warms-- with an elegant buzz that will cause even us shy people to play air-conductor along with thier favorite symphony with the wild hair-tossing, insouciant ecstasy of Seiji Ozawa.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"

Aromas are of lactic wheat, mascerated cherries, yeast, malts, and alcohols. Effervescent carbonation makes it easy to keep a head on it. Almost champagne like, but not too carbonated. Just right for the style. A little bit of Belgian funk is present as well.
Rich, chocolately notes in the beginning of the beer, with a smooth mouthfeel coming in right behind it. Finishes rich, smooth, and chocolately. Odd combination in a Belgian beer, if you ask me. Slight lambic quality brings up the rear, and it finishes with a slight tang as well. A decent effort from Ommegang.","","Cobra"

I would like to have the same beer sans kriek, for it might be much more enjoyable.   re-rate 2004 bottle:  Much less medicinal than the first bottle that I had.

Very nice beer, a perfect mix of nice belgium strong flavors and the cherry.

 Pours a very dark mahogany body and a chunky kaki colored head. The aroma is toasty with bountiful doses of caramel and toffee malts. I smell some vanilla and notes of butterscotch in there! The flavor is far more toasted that I was expecting. Very much a cross between a fresh slice of Rye and Pumpernickel bread; the graininess of the Rye but the toasty coco likens of the pumpernickel. Rather yeasty, notes of old oak cask, fruity suggestions of fig and dates, and raisins, along side lighter proposals of plums and apricots brown sugar. Delicate hint of sage hiding somewhere.

Malt focused aroma with notes of caramel and dark fruits, almost like blackberry syrup.  Thick malty flavors dominate in the mouth, with hints of molasses and a myriad of berry oriented flavors.  I truly cannot pick out the cherry lambic flavors, which really surprised me as Lindemans Kriek is a beer I know fairly well.  There is a bit of a bite at the finish that I think would probably fade with some aging (2003 bottling sampled).  The alcohol is evident but integrated in the manner of a good port.  Nice job.

On the other hand, there's a definite peachy profile into this, together with bready yeast and maple. The body is outstanding, better than any ABT from belgium I've had, decadent creaminess and perfectly mouth-filling. Finish is chocolatey and malty.

2289,"2004-02-22",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 28, 2006 A full and creamy khaki head of majestic proportions sits gracefully on a deep and dense ruby hued body.  The aroma begins with dried cherries, figs and prunes and expands to encompass a rich glass of real cocoa, right down to the lactic aroma of warmed milk.  Malty graham cracker and sweet bread elements peak through.  Vinous, oaky qualities seem to arise late in the game.  Bananas, blackberries, brown sugar are a few of the other sweet treats that find their way in the aroma.  The flavor is somewhat of a departure from the aroma, providing more sourness from start to finish than is anticipated.  Upfront dark fruits and hints of chocolate take lead.  Mid-palate is where the lactic sourness really finds its strength, combined with that quirky tang of blood oranges.  The finish exhibits sparse bitterness and instead provides a slow warming alcohol note, some clove and cardamom spices and a sweet aftertaste reminiscent of tawny port.  Mouthfeel is big and chewy throughout and this one never dries out, staying firmly sweet and maybe a touch sticky all the way.  Fortunately, the carbonation is formidable and keeps everything moving along in the end.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

2289,"2004-02-05",4.0,"Brewed 2003, Sampled February 2004  As I pop the cork I get an immediate aroma of cherries.  The cork did not pop very vigorously though, so it seems that this may not be very highly carbonated.  It pours though with a vigourous carbonation.  It is a muddy amber-ruby color and is toppped by a light brown thick head.  There are meaty, malty, cherry, and alcoholic notes in the aroma.  As my nose incorporates the aroma the smell of cherries fades and one is left with a spicy Belgian ale nose.  This beer has a creamy mouthfeel to it, but it is not too thick for a Belgian quadrupel, in fact it would be on the light side for some of that designation.  It is fairly sweet, and finishes with an alcoholic astringency which is not all that strong.  There is definitely some cherries in this beer, but I like that it is fairly subtle and is only one component of this beer.  This beer has a soft acidity to it, that is not directly traceable to the Kriek addition.  There are fruit notes of raisins, plums, and fig.  Though it is sweet up front it finishes with a spicy astringent dryness that is evocative of some herb/ spice that I can't quite think of.  This is a very well made beer.  You can tell that a world class brewer put this beer together.  Having said that it is missing something; though it is quite complex a couple of other dimensions would be wonderful here.  Perhaps a bit of acidity & a bit of Brettanomyces character would be wonderful (I know this is a ridiculous request as these things are not too controllable, but De Dolle gets some of this right, at least sometimes).  A very rich beer that is quite satisfying, I definitely like this best of the Ommegang products.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Bit of a letdown due to high expectations, but certainly very good.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

2289,"2003-12-26",4.1,"Again, props to Slikwily for this one!  Coppery brown with orange and reddish highlights under a lasting tannish head.  Caramel malts, bananas, and and raisins are the most notable aromas at first.  A moderate buttery aroma (diacetyl) appears as it warms slightly, as well as a lightly bready yeasty aroma and toasted malt and alcohol.    Malty flavors and bananas start out the flavor as it does in the aroma.  Good think I like bananas!  Then a vinous raisin character with the same toasted malt notes as in the aroma.  The buttery flavors don't seem to be as predominant in the flavor as in the aroma, but it's there in just a hint.  A slightly solventy alcohol flavor creeps into the finish of this very well balanced beer.  Aftertaste is of raisins and toasted malt.  Medium bodied with surprisingly moderate carbonation for a Belgian ale.  There is a slight astringency that I'm not terribly keen on, but it seems to be one of the few flaws this beer has.  Alcohol is warming and adds nicely to the complexity.  This is a bitter sweet beer for me.  Sweet because I like and have gotten the chance to taste it.  Bitter because it will probably not be available for very long!","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

Ruby tinted amber colour with a super dense tan head. Aroma slightly of cherries, but favouring malt, raisins, plums and alcohol. Medium-bodied; Sweet caster sugar/caramel sweetness. Slight sourness midway through, but not lasting long. Aftertaste bittered from the malt, not left clean. Overall, not pleasing, not a great value, and therefore a pretty big dissapointment!

It has a pretty extreme spiciness and a whollop from the alcohol. Thought it tasted like a Leffe Blonde mixed with a little old wine. 
I didn't detect any banana like others did. Just alcohol, SPICE, and winelike notes. Didn't really taste any cherry. I figured since it was blended from Lindemans Kriek it would have some of that syrupy cherry flavor (which I thought would be balanced by the Ommegang brew) didn't really taste it.

Poured an extremely large sized head of almost all foam in my mug.  Foamy light brown very long lasting finely sized bubbles.  Very hazy brown with finely sized yeast particles,  Poor lacing.  Mild malty cherry aroma with a mild vinous note.  Tingly start strong tingly vinous finish soon fades into its aftertaste.  Not as overpowering as first rating.  Vinous mild alcohol burn mild dark cherry malt burning hops.  Little to no-lambic like tart sweetness as the label suggested.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
2289,"2003-06-13",4.1,"Pours a dark garnet color with a medium sized, but eventually diminishing, beige head. The aroma was dominated by sweet grapes, dark fruit...with some nice wood (roasted?) tones. The flavor was again very sweet, grapes, plums, vanilla, wood, very floral/perfumey. Unfortunately, this brew had an odd watery feel on the tongue...odd because of the immense flavors present. Lively carbonation. Overall, a very finely crafted beer.","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"
2289,"2003-05-26",3.1,"UPDATED: OCT 20, 2009 750mL 2009 bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy medium to dark amber, bottle conditioned. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted bread, cookie, caramel), lightly yeasty (cobwebs, basement), with light notes of cherry, sugar/icing/honey, gum. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic. Surprisingly watery and light-bodied for its size and professed style.  Nice enough aroma, but nothing exciting.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2289,"2003-04-28",4.0,"This ale pours a dark, ruby red color with a thin, diminishing, off-white head. The aroma is malty with lots of fruity notes including banana. It has a full body with light carbonation. The flavor is very malty and fruity with banana, vanilla, bread, and alcohol notes. The finish is lingering sweet. Very good, almost like a stronger version of the regular Ommegang.","Greenville, South Carolina, USA","Uglyradio"

2289,"2003-04-04",5.0,"Dark amber color,strong head that is long lasting,and lite tan in color.Nice aroma of malt ,raisin,some alcohol and i know i'm wrong but it almost smells like there's some maple syrup in there some where IMHO.Slight wine like aroma in there but,not being a wine nut i can't say what kind of wine it could be.slight syrup feel to it.Malty taste,licorice,lots of licorice,slightly sweet some fruit tones hard to put my fingure on which one exactly but in my unintelligent opinion it seems like raisin maybe some dryed prune,with a very slight alcohol taste that is not over powering at all.It had an after taste that was quite pleasant slight alcohol with some sweet prune to it with a some what syrupy feel that make the finish of sweet malt last a long time.this is definately a brew worth keeping for some ageing to see if the flavor's come together better which i feel they will.I'm glad to say that i have a 6-pack of these and will be trying them 1 year at a time to see how they age,because a brew like this is well worth waiting for.It's not very complex but it definately has the potential to be even better with age,and i have plenty of time to wait for it to blossom into something special,For those of you who haven't tryed on yet.Eat you heart out.muhahahaha","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
2289,"2003-03-31",3.5,"Nice dark foxy-red colour, clear; slight orange-brown head. Fruity nose: sweet cherries, strawberry. 
Later Port or Marssala - like nose, vineous, alcoholy. Bitter-sweet  taste, alternating between a nauseating liquorice sweetness and an outspoken burnt toffee&malt flavour. Fruit is reduced to a jam-like flavour (Japanese cherries-jam?). After a time, one gets accustomed, but I cannot even start to like it. Medium-bodied, diminishing effect by the alcohol, augmented by the jam-fruitiness. After a while, the vineous character from the nose reappears. But the vile burnt liquorice keeps hanging on. I'm sure this beer was on a Mission. For me, it failed. What I mostly blame it for, is for the unfullfilled promesses made by the nose, resulting in a complete unbalance between nose and taste.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

2289,"2003-03-11",3.6,"Smelled like a Tootsie Roll and tasted like one too. Vanilla characteristics burst forth. Nice caramely (sp) coloring and quite malty. I like mine malty and this carries that quality very well, but also has a underlying bitterness that forced me to rate it a bit lower than I would have cared to. C'est la vie. I waited years to try this thing and I'm still not sure if it was worth the wait.","Escondido, California, USA","Dougal"

2289,"2003-02-26",4.3,"Aroma of caramel, toffee, and oak with some alcoholic notes.  Pours a dark brown with off-white head.  Flavor is best characterized as smooth, sweet, and mellow. A silky mouthfeel leads to a light candi sugar finish.  Incredibly balanced beer which conceals most of its alcohol.  I am quite impressed with this concoction.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
2289,"2003-02-25",4.3,"Dark amber color.  Thick, rocky head and a strong intensely fruity aroma.  Pears, figs, banana, raisin and spice.  Alcohol well hidden but present slightly in the finish.  My favorite beer from Ommegang.","Washington DC, USA","jskendzel"

2289,"2003-02-18",4.3,"Beautiful dark reddish brown with light offwhite head.  Nose of fruit and malt, taste of fruit, spice, caramel, and malt backbone.  Since there really are no fruits in the beer, we may differ in how we interpret the fruitiness; to me it was raisins, figs, and cherries.  Finish of malt with fruit and an alcohol burn.  Like Dogfish Raison d'extra, this is not a casual beer or a beer that matches easily with food ... but at less than half the alcohol it is going to be easier to drink.  Not easy to find, but worth looking for.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"
2289,"2003-02-11",4.9,"This is an unbelievable beer.  It pours a hazy deep amber with an eggshell colored head.  The taste is reminscent of dried fruits (I picked up raisens, apples, and pears) and of a nice clean malt.  The finish is clean and similar to the fruitiness mentioned above.  This beer of very limited availablity is definitly worth seeking out for a guaranteed wonderful beer experience.","Pennsylvania, USA","Prostman"
2289,"2003-01-29",3.5,"UPDATED: FEB 29, 2004 Ruby/amber color with a thick tan head. Aromas of dates, figs, plums and other fruits abound along with a whiff of alcohol.  Thick, chewy and mouthcoating.  Swet fruity flavors.  Seems to lack the maltiness I prefer (but that could just be a personal preferance). Warming and burning alcohol in the finish.  A substancial brew. Aroma-9, Appearance-4, Flavor-8, Palate-4, Overall-17.  

In my opinion the new white label is a completely a different brew.  The label indicates ""Ale with cherry-lambic added"".  Brown with amber hues. Moderate light tan head. Aromas of rich malt, light cherries and alcohol.  Malt and light fruity backdrop. More biting then I remember the original.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

2289,"2003-01-13",4.1,"Amazing.  The things they can do with malts and yeast.  Strong banana aroma.  Deep ochre brown, hazy, with a thick off white head.  Initial flavor is banana and a bit of paint thinner, something strong, like xylol, and a touch of pineapple.  Flavor tapers off to a crispy dry apricot and a little pruney flavor.  Very complex, with a great sourness in the end.  Alcohol is evident.  Id rate this beer higher if it was hidden.  Definitely a rare treat from one of the best breweries in the United States.","Connecticut, USA","UnionMade"

2289,"2002-11-02",4.4,"This is an amazing belgian produced by Ommegang.  It is a completely different beast from the Ommegang that I am used to tasting.  Tastes of apples and syrup.  But a tart tannic that puckers your mouth.  This is a complex ale but is very smooth.  Get your hands on some of this!","San Francisco, California, USA","MrDick"
2289,"2002-10-20",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2004 The white labeled 2004 version sure tastes a whole lot different than the old brown-labeled version. I am not quite sure just where the differences are; perhaps the older version was a little fruitier with a more definite earthiness. The newer version seems a little maltier and a little tarter. I would really like to do a side by side tastingof the two.....The Winner of the Brew your dream beer contest. Dark brown color, smallish head, lacy with some arabesques. Figs and apricots in the nose. Very complex flavors. Malts, spices, figs, earthy and fruity. Well balanced. Very smooth taste, a slightly alcohol bite at 9.8%. Great mix of complex subtle flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth and smooth. Finish is very clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty and sweet. WOW. Great beer from a great brewery.

2289,"2002-10-20",4.4,"The star of the evening. The ratings here got me down abt this beer but it was the star in an evening of tasting that included some very nice brews. Apple plumes, interesting grape seed aromas, arabesques atop, clean and true, beautiful, figgy, soft smooth winey feel complete with a tannic finish. Very different from Ommegang. Light maple and tobacco/pepper aromas arrive as it warms.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"

2289,"2002-07-30",2.8,"Quite possibly the longest commercial description for any beer, let alone one that really wasnt all that great. Too much alcohol in the aroma and flavor. The fruity flavors seemed to be dominated by alcohol, as did the aroma. Compared to the rest of the Ommegang brews this one falls way below par.","Jeannette, Pennsylvania, USA","dolemike1"
2289,"2002-06-25",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 29, 2005 First batch. Pop of cork exhibited no life.  Aroma is dominated by alcohol. Underlying sweet prunes, maple/brown sugar, rum, dates, and caramel.  Becomes port-like and toffeeish as it nears room temp.  Dense and creamy foam floats atop a plum color.  Spritzy, semi-full mouthfeel.  Warming alcohol makes itself very apparent, initially.  Apples and caramel lead the way before strange fishy notes and a delectable dry/bitter chocolate that lingers for an ample amount of time.  Lush biscuity malt residuals.  Complexity really awakens at room temp.    A shining example.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

2289,"2002-05-13",4.0,"Semi-clear dark amber with notes of burgundy red. Thin foamy light tan head. Moderate carbonation. Aroma of plums, raisins, grains of paradise. Smooth and fluffy with noticeable alcohol and the typical Ommegang flavors. Loaded with lip smacking sweetness, grains of paradise and a marshmallow like fluffiness. Airy body with a light effervescence. Nice plummy fruitiness and toffee malt underbelly. Smoother with a lighter body than I expected. Apple like cider quality emerges as you sip. Turns a bit drier and thicker bodied towards the finish, where the alcohol and tart apple fruity quality melds with the grains of paradise and spiciness to finish this off nicely. An interesting but solid offering.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"

Medium bodied, dry, with hints of cherries, strong yeast presence, cocoa, spices, alcohol and raisons. Its ok but just seems to yeasty and dry to me. Any real cherry flavor comes very late. Smells better then it tastes, improves as it warms. 8/3/6/3/15


A deep cloudy (might not have settled long enough),burning  red with orange hues. Fizzy,quickly dissipating head. Strong fruity aroma of apricots, maybe apple, spices,yeast and many others. Similar to regular Ommegang. Seems very accurate to the description but that may be power of suggestion. Beautifully thick mouthfeel, a steady and mellow carbonation with an array of tastes. Dark fruits (raisons, figs), hint of bubblegum,orange,lots of fine yeast character. Alcohol is felt but infused masterfully. Finished fairly dry with hints of cocoa, orange and leather(maybe in nose as well) The flavors are all there equally in a wave of subtleness but at the sametime complete and refined. Sight bitter bite at end to add to an already balanced beer. Maybe a bit heavy with the yeast but why complain, a damn fine drink. I swear I taste cedar as well, I should not have read the freakin description!!Very complex IMHO.  Watch out boys, it has a kick thats felt immediatley. Worth seeking out if you can get it.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
