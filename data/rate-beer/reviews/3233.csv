3233,"2017-06-16",3.0,"True to the style. Light and refreshing. Mild malt aroma, light malt front. Not bad for a lager. Good summer beer. Definitely improved with a lime.

3233,"2017-06-04",3.1,"Sample at Beer Camp Fest in Portland, ME. Pours bright hazy yellow with a foamy white head. Nose is lime with some grassy notes. Taste is a bit tart.","North Berwick, Maine, USA","GIJOE"
3233,"2017-05-14",3.5,"Pours light golden with a thin, fizzy white top. Aroma is malty first - cracker, cracked pepper. Flavor follows similarly though a bit watery feel and throughout the sip theres a mild, but somewhat unpleasant, metallic bitterness. Not bad but would not get this again. Also, wildly overpriced - 4-pk@$13 !","New Hampshire, USA","tekstr1der"
3233,"2017-02-14",3.7,"Canned 7/16/16, drunk 1/13/17.Obviously not ideal for a lager to sit six months, though I am always very curious when they do as it really is a chance to see how well-made a brewerys beers are. This one pours a pale bronze with a large, moderately well-retained white head. High clarity.The nose is peppery with grassy and herbal hops atop light hints of maize and a touch of powdered sugar or wax. Otherwise, clean as a whistle though not overly aromatic.In the mouth, theres a strong pepper component, with light grass, bits of biscuit and some of the waxiness from the nose. Perhaps just a touch of oxidation, really, and even to be expected. Clean and with ample carbonation and very good dryness. Banded Horn has really been impressing me lately.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3233,"2016-09-16",3.4,"Mild Lime and grass aroma. Bright yellow with a mild haziness. Bright white head. Has mild lime tart taste with a grassy graininess balancing out the rest. Light bodied with a refreshing finish.","Foxboro, Massachusetts, USA","rjplumer"
3233,"2016-08-01",3.0,"16oz can. Pours a pale golden with a white head. Very little flavor or character making it a dead on example of the style. Its drinkable but boring. Not sure why I even bought this.",", Massachusetts, USA","BroSpud"
3233,"2016-05-28",3.0,"From the 16 oz. can with a canning date of 5/11/126. So pretty fresh. Very pale yellow pour under a moderate white fizzy head. The aroma is a bit of toasted malts, grass but really nothing over the top. The body is light. The taste is a bit of an uptick with a good bready and toasty malt character - almost like a Pilsener. The finish is dryish. It would be fine on a hot day.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
3233,"2015-10-02",2.7,"Bottle from the Drinkery Derry
Slightly hazy deep yellow color with a decent fuzzy white head that leaves some stickies to the sides of the glass. Big lime citrus note on the nose, but an almost lactic note as well. Faint corn bready malt I think. The flavor has hints of pilsner breadiness and a sharp citric and carbonic bite. I love what they were trying to do, but honestly a Corona is more skillfully brewed.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
3233,"2015-07-16",2.0,"Pours a weak yellow with a white head. Well carbonated. Nose is hops on first opening. It quickly recedes. Body is medium thin. Taste is thin Mexican malt up front with a sharp bitterness and aftertaste. It not as balanced as the brewery claims. Their web site has logo of the beer but it is not listed. This was outrageously priced at $13/six pack but I wanted to try it.","Massachusetts, USA","damzz"
3233,"2015-06-13",2.9,"12 oz. bottle thanks to Brian for this night ender! Clear yellow, thin lasting head. Aroma is stale lager yeast, weak grain or dare I say corn? 
Mouthfeel is very much a Macro lager. Funky lager yeast, and the old hop profile. Lighter, thin texture but it does have a crispness to it. Well, they did get the cheap lager taste down to the letter. Not sure what else I can say other than Brian said we should add a lime. Yes the lime did give some complexity.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3233,"2015-06-13",3.2,"12oz bottle from 7-eleven. Pours pale white gold with a white head. Aroma is honey, wet crackers. Smells like a cheap lager. Yup, honey, wet crackers, just a bit of earthy hop... Tastes like a cheap lager too. A good cheap lager, if there is such a thing, but a cheap lager nonetheless. Not surprisingly, this tastes better with a wedge of lime in it.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
3233,"2015-05-19",3.5,"12oz bottle thanks to Lukaduke! Pours clear pale golden yellow with a finger of head. Nose has earthy grains and corn, cracker and some subtle lemongrass. Taste is grain-forward, cracker snd dry biscuit, cornbread, touches of grassy lemon and oats. Finishes medium-low bitterness, rounded lingering cracker and grass, grain. Solid.","Hampton Roads, Virginia, USA","JBPortland"
3233,"2015-04-30",3.3,"Pours a slightly hazy pale golden color with a finger of white foam. Nose is soft corn, cracked wheat and a touch of fresh grass. Palate follows with a refreshing mouthfeel, slight sweet corn undertones, light bitterness, soft malt profile. Easy drinker. Not really sure why I would buy a 6pk for $13 dollars of this style beer though.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
