3838,"2017-01-20",3.7,"From notes. Enjoyed at a small get together at Dougs for the National Championship game with Travis and Chris on January 09. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a brighter golden yellow with a thick pillowy white head that falls down with a decent lace left behind. The aroma is incredibly funky. There is a good lemon zest, a hint of spicy yeast, a light grassiness, and a strong floral addition to it. The fink really dominates. I like that this doesnt have the clove. The flavor is much of the same. Really funky, lightly fruity, a hint spicy, and very well balanced. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a softer carbonation and a lingeringly funky, grassy, and lightly herbal finish.

Fresh, crisp, but acidic aroma, a bit harsh, some saisony aspects. Straw, small head, not too brief. Harsh dirty palate, acidic and sharp and cidery. Brett, my arse. Are therse guys just more yanks who havent got a clue which bug is which, and what each one does. Fortunately whatever bugs are in here have left quite drinkable brew. Almost, but not quite, refreshing - the dryness of the yeast is a bit dirty and earthy. Does cover the 6% fairly well, though. At least its not a cookie-cutter saison, but its a cookie-cutter gone-sour beer. Good brewers managed to work out how to stop their beers going sour. Brave to fight against that trend. Some succeed, some dont. Ug, second pour more lemony, more refreshing aroma, but taste is just shitty lemon juice. Fuck that, Ive thrown away homebrews like this.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

This is much more of a sour ale than what we think of as saison nowadays. I very much appreciate some tartness in saisons, but...this is full on puckeringly *sour*, virtually lambic level. Which is perhaps historically accurate if were talking pre-WW2, spontaneously fermented varieties. But at a hefty 6% ABV, thats obviously not what they were trying to reproduce. This ""sour saison"" thing seems to be a growing trend in America...which is a lot better than the trend of making sugary sweet banana bombs and calling those saison, but still...this is over the top in the acidity department. Its well made otherwise, though...pleasant, mild Brett character and no banana to be found. The aroma is a bit generic as golden sour ales go, but its certainly enjoyable. Call it ""Arctic Sour Ale"" and I could perhaps be a little more enthusiastic about this. But if you call it a saison and come in at 6%, in that case Im looking for something like Dupont or Blaugies.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Forthrightly acidic flavor with apple cider vinegar, lemon juice and pineapple in the front, backed by creamy notes of banana, white pepper and vanilla. Thoroughly bretty. Baked apples and pears, with lots of sugar and bright yellow fruit always coming back. This is young.

Prickly palate eases back with the yeast pour, when it becomes denser, softer, and wetter. A lovely gruyere rind-like flavor flashes briefly just before the finish, when the juicy pineapple acidity joins it for the classic brett effect.

3838,"2014-01-31",4.1,"I split 750ml bottle with a friend. It was bottled in May of 2013 and cost $10. ($0.39 per ounce).

Appearance: Beautiful golden hue. Crystal clear at first, but becomes quite cloudy when sediment is mixed in. Pours to a large, bright white, fluffy head which retains well but doesnt lace the glass.

Smell: Strong aroma of Brettanomyces plus clean lemon scent. 

Taste: I was little nervous about drinking a nine-month-old bottle of saison, but was pleasantly surprised by how strong the flavor had remained and what was there was delicious. This is cleaner and fruitier than most saisons, and the Brett character gives is a noticeable amount of tartness and earthy character to make it more than interesting without becoming distracting.

The initial palette is fruity with distinct lemonpeel and a general clean citrus taste. White grape also appears to be quite noticeable. The Brett character emerges about halfway through the palette - giving it a discernible tartness. A hint of sour, but more accurately described as a farmhouse funk. The yeast and sediment impart some bitterness and give the palette a little more character. The residual aftertaste is quite pleasant. I didnt find there to be any oak character at all, despite the labels indication that it was aged in oak tanks.

Drinkability: Saisons were created to be refreshing and thats exactly what Grassroots Brewing Arctic Saison is. Its extremely crisp and clean and seems to cleanse the palate as it goes down. It feels much lighter than its 6% ABV weight, though it definitely has the flavor of a brew that strong. .

Batch-1 May 2013

A - This beer is cloudy with a golden pale color, a massive rocky white head slowly settles with cavernous mounds of bubbles. Sloppy wet lacing sinks down the sides of the glass.

S - Grain dust, earthy hay, grainy pilsner malts, lemons and minerals, the yeast is tangy and bready with a very mild funk and timid white pepper phenolics. Mushrooms come out once it warms up.

T - Tangy lemons, mineral soda water, slightly acidic, the dusty hay and grassiness fade quickly as it warms. Bright tropical fruits work well against the grainy pale malt. Lemony tang really comes around on the backend along with a floral/herbal bitterness finishing crisp and clean.

M - Active seltzer-like carbonation, light body, crisp and clean.

Bright, dry, and very refreshing. A very nice Saison indeed. Extremely crisp with mineral water and tangy lemon taking the stage. I am thoroughly enjoying this beer on a brisk 28 degree November night.

This is my first beer from the much-lauded Hill Farmstead, coming with all the higher expectations given my fondness for the stuff coming out of Anchorage Brewing. It does not disappoint. Gorgeous Anchorage pour: light hazy maize with a beautiful white head. The aroma is just crazy delicious: grassy with lemon zest, backed by ample leathery brett -- but it doesnt prepare one for the flavor, at least not after acclimating to the previous beer, the malty Pissenlit. The flavor comes on surprisingly dry and tart, catching me by surprise as it pushes just into the softer reaches of sour territory. Theres a ton going on here: chewy leather, tongue-scraping wood. Light hints of pepper, all driven along on a wave of mouth-drying brett and with pucker-inducing lemon juice.  So good. This would be a hell of front-lawn-on-a-summers-day saison. Worth revisiting and a worthy first encounter with Hill Farmstead. 8/4/8/4/17=4.1

Revisit 1/20/15. I liked this a lot the first time around, but I needed to try a bottle by myself to really get the feeling for it. So here it is.  At $13.99 from Chucks, this is definitely on the expensive side of the beers Ive been drinking lately, and definitely on the high side for a regular drinker. Fluffy shape-holding white head atop hazy gold (by the time I reach the bottom of the bottle; clearer in the first pours). Much of what I wrote above stands, plenty of grapefruit and aggressive sourness from the brett, oak apparent, a bit buttery, good, and better the more one drinks, but short of exceptional. Id go about 3.9 or 4.0 at most, and will bump down slighty. Nice enough, but at this price its not one that I need to revisit often.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

3838,"2013-11-10",3.6,"A very soft pour produces a four finger thick, pale tan colored head that subsides with a mesa like structure to it; as the beer subsides it leaves lots of lacing on the sides of the glass. The beer is a soft honey color that shows a lightly hazy, bright yellow-gold hue when held up to the light. The aroma has a light lemon like note to it, lots of musty, phenolic, funky Brettanomyces character. A woody pepper spiciness, and a bit of earthy spiciness that is sort of grassy, sort of coriander like character. The earthy spiciness is accentuated by a hay like, and pale cracker maltiness.

The beer has a nice effervescence, and is quite light bodied. There is a solid pale malt character that provides a chewy, pale grain character that contributes soft cracker like notes, and a fresh, sun toasted grain character. There is a nice hoppiness here that provide an herbal, pine like edge, and this is accentuated by a soft woodiness from the oak that also provides a peppery spiciness, a woody astringency, and a touch of toasted woodiness. The beer is a bit phenolic in character, with a Brettanomyces character that provides a musty, pepper accentuating, slightly plastic like, and definitely on the earthy side of the spectrum.

The aroma is really something funky... lemon rind, oak, limestone basement, mild animal sweat... appealing but really heavy on the lemon and citrus rind. 

The flavor is not nearly as sour as the aroma had me braced for, its got a nice balance of citrus fruit flavors & earthy happiness. The bitterness is not big but lends to the balance of the beer in a big way. Its really nicely tart with a good light lemony sourness... and a nice minerality. Some light soft breadiness is buried and peeks its head out early in the palate.

3838,"2013-10-07",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2014 My Bottom Line :  
Citrusy, floral and bready throughout, this dazzling Wild Saison adds herbal wild yeast angles to the very refreshing dryness and delicate tartness.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A dollop of foam decorates the hazy straw blond.
-Gets breadier when the yeast is poured in. This second glass blurs out some of the masterpiece felt in the first glass, but its a wondrous Saison nonetheless at this point.
-Chlorophyl-like vivacity seems to ooze from the hops and yeast signature.
-The finish evokes gentle wild yeast greenness alongside herbal hop bitterness.
-Drinkability is through the roof.
-All flavors are soooo well balanced and harmonious.

A- A hazy straw yellow color with a hint of orange and a soapy white head about 2 inches tall. Carbonation is apparent, and fine bubbles are rising from the bottom to the surface. Great lacing and decent retention once the head settles down to a thin but solid head over the beer. 

S- Brett up front. Orange peel, some phenolic notes and a slightly acidic odor as well. There is a slight pils malt character as the beer warms. 

T- Almost tea-like. It is very floral and earthy with some citrus to balance. The brett yeast character is very present as well. Some bitterness and floral notes on the back end, maybe the hops accentuated by the dry finish?

M- High carbonation levels hit you right away on the front end. On the back end, the dry finish accentuated the bitterness and leaves you with a slightly harsh note.

The first whiff reveals some summer floral notes. Thats quickly joined by: light clove, chamomile, straw, brett, white grape, oak, and funky cheese. The aroma is nice but a little odd. In the mouth this is lightly tart, crisp, and dry. Flavors of lemon and orange citrus mixes with oak, bretty yeast, a light crackery malt, a bit of grass, and soft herbal undertones. Very well put together with great depth, but I expected nothing less from two of my favorite brewers. A bone dry and lightly bitter finish concludes this nicely.

Extremely dry, sharp, lightly tart finish (described by another person tasting this as ""unripe gooseberries"" -- a taste I cant personally identify, but maybe that description will resonate with others who read this review).

Notes: This beer was excellent to start, and only got better as it warmed, as slightly more sweet malty notes came up.

Palate: light body, effervescent and refreshing, crisp finish.
Overall: really great brew, nice complexity and balance.","Iowa, USA","ekoerper"
3838,"2013-08-06",3.9,"Hazy yellow orange pour with a huge white head and really nice lacing. Aroma is dusty, funky, damp wood, lemongrass, and a bit of pepper spice. Taste is lemon in the forefront with funk, wood, grass, and a hint of spice. Very dry on the palate. Really easy to drink. Brett is nice throughout.","Corinth, Texas, USA","jhamp9"
3838,"2013-08-05",4.0,"750 ml bottle from Belmont Station. Thanks to Luke for the tip. Pours a clear golden-almost yellow- color with a large white head. A nice nose of Brett, lemons, dusty funkiness. The flavor is super clean and tasty: big Brett effect in action, horse blanket, hay, lemon, some oak, vanilla, super dry. Really drinkable, I mean superbly so like I could drink 2 liters. Excellent palate. Nice brew. Very drinkable and smooth which might not stand out when people are ISO massive flavors like IIPAs and big Stouts. But this is super well done.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
3838,"2013-08-03",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2013 $11.99 for the bottle purchased from Hunger Mountain 45 minutes before closing. Last one. Had to grab from the shelf. This is only fitting that Im drinking the liquid while Lou Reed serenades my entire floor with his catchy street lingo. Mmm. To oversized snifter, it pours a wooded hazy orange; trim snowy white head 1 finger in length. Aromas of salted organic butter, leeks, chalk, poppy seeds, earl grey tea, banana bread, algae, ginger, sunflower pedals, nectarine zest, and brimstone. Tastes almost identical. Definitely got some salted butter; poppy seeds; earl grey tea; and algae, with the addition of sweat, cotton, and spice. Hops, well water, and yeast by swallow. Yeah, I liked this.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"
3838,"2013-07-30",3.8,"Hazy golden color, large white head, good lacing and retention. Aroma is loaded with bret, light oak, light funk, light citrus, light grass. Medium bodied, funky, light sweetness. Nice one.","California, USA","ABUSEDGOAT"

3838,"2013-07-24",3.7,"Bottle. Pours with a lightly hazy golden yellow hue body with a large, mostly retentive white head. Very good lace. Aromas are of mild funk, lemon verbena, crackery malt, citrus, light peppery phenol, a touch of pineapple brett character. Mildly herbal (sage) with dry esters. Dry and rustic. Flavors are grainy, bready, very dry, lightly nutty. Young brett character. Strong malt graininess. Lightly citrusy, medium funky. A bit less complexity than I was expecting maybe, although it is still refined. Very lively carbonation. Dry finish, very light tannin, nicely drinkable. As far as Anchorage Saisons (albeit a very different animal), I prefer Love Buzz. Still a very nice quenching saison. A solid beer.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
3838,"2013-07-21",5.0,"750mL bottle. Pours a hazy golden yellow with a thick white head. Lemon, apple, some funk, slightly tart. I really liked the lemon flavor to this Saison. It made it very drinkable and refreshing.

3838,"2013-07-20",4.2,"750 ml. bottle. It pours a light orange color with a thick, fluffy white head. The aroma has some fresh baked bread, mild tart fruit and spices, apricots, hay and wheat. Mild funkiness. The flavor is very bready and mildly spicy with bright notes of dried apricots. Funk is subdued. The mouthfeel is absolutely superb. Super creamy and full. The finish is bready and spicy with only a hint of wet hay. A lovely beer.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

3838,"2013-07-14",3.8,"Bottle shared by GT. Thanks. Hazed golden pour with a white head. Nice bretty aroma. Bread, pineapple, cracker, and lemon peel. Some apricot, white pepper, and a touch of leather. The flavor is nice and tart. Sweet apricot and pineapple, cracker malt, and lots of white pepper. Dry, bretty finish. Leather, straw, and grass. Very high carbonation.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3838,"2013-07-14",3.9,"Pours bright yellow-gold. Quite cloudy. Solid white head. Good sized layer of foam. Good retention, some lacing. The aroma has fresh grain, dusty barnyard, some light stone fruit, lemons. Lots of brett presence. Clean. The taste adds in more oak than expected. Big acerbic woodiness, particularly in the finish. Its mostly pleasant. Lots of clean brett flavor. Some apricots and citrus peel. Mouthfeel is lively and light. Its almost a touch thin for my taste. Very good saison but a touch boring with so many others coming out. It could just use some sort of twist to stand out.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
3838,"2013-07-14",4.2,"Nice phenolic aroma with peppercorn and clove. Esters are moderate and are citrus and pear. Moderate Brett grapefruit note and medium low oak character that becomes more pronounced as it warms. 
Pours a cloudy pale yellow gold with a pillowy white head with average retention. Moderate lacing with low legs. 
Nice light graininess with a hint of sweetness upfront. Moderate phenolics, peppercorn and clove like the aroma. Moderate pineapple note again. Moderate oak character. Light pear and citrus esters. Medium low bitterness. Lingering phenolic spice and Brett in finish.
Mouthfeel is medium light with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall a really nice beer but I think I would like a hint of acidity. The balance of this beer tends towards oak and Brett. It is also more phenolic than estery.

3838,"2013-07-14",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 13, 2013 750mL in Anchorage silk screen guise from El Cerrito for $12. Pours a low haze, bright straw with thick white foam. Nice retention and lacing. Nose is bright coriander/white pepper, fresh lemon, fresh white dough and muted Brett with grassy hops. Taste is very dry...crackery pale malt, lemon potpourri. Palate is super dry, soapy, mild paper comes into play given the extreme dryness. Solid, though a tad dry for me, which is rarely a problem. 7/14/2013 8/4/7/4/15=3.8750mL from El Cerrito. Couple months old now. Glowing, gorgeous full haze peach pour. Ridiculous head formation in the oversized Tripel Karmeliet tulip. Rises out of the glass without spilling over retaining the same dimensions of the rim of the tulip. Insane. Nose is fresh orange and mango sorbet, fresh buttery bread roll. Taste at first is sharper, dry, near chemical but finally falls into place as being tropical, juicy, and cedar dry with high effervescence and amazing quenching ability. Exactly what was intended by Gabe and Shaun. Impressive. 9/13/2013 8/5/8/4/16=4.1","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3838,"2013-07-10",4.5,"First thought.. great light golden color, with a thin head. After one whiff, I knew this was a well made beer. Super well-balanced subtle aromas and flavors... Nothing is out of proportion, yet everything is well delineated and distinct. Great weight and carbonation on palate. Super refreshing and easy to drink, almost edging on a mouthwatering, dry, tartness. Citrus, dried florals, hay, fresh grain, dusty, funky, Brett nuances dominate the aroma and flavor. Nice lingering dry finish of above mentioned flavors, with a touch of mouthwatering bitterness. Nothing odd, extreme or exaggerated.. Simply a light, classic, well crafted saison, without a bone out of place. Highly recommended... Um.. More please.

3838,"2013-07-10",3.7,"Dry champagne like apple sour aroma with a light white head. Golden copper color with a bit of cloudiness to it. Sour saison for sure. with a bitter aftertaste. The first taste compared to the 5th are very different. Gets kinda funked after a few sips. I think its just over powering my tounge. Damn good start and kinda bland finish.","Truckee, California, USA","coreyc1221"
3838,"2013-07-10",4.6,"Light wet farm and spice and floral scents. A cloudy enough to not see through the glass but not so cloudy you cant see the stream of small bubble in the center. mmm I am smelling it some more it smells amazing. Light body but flavor that increases from a light straw into a delicious bitter funk. It fades slowly leaving you time to consider the variety of spicy, earthy and fruity flavors.","truckee, California, USA","krumbum"

3838,"2013-06-11",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 23, 2013 750ml bottle. Batch 1 consumed at ABC. Should be distributed via shelton but lucky to have this prior to distribution... Pours a golden vivid orange ethereal hue and topped with a frothy soapy white head... Aroma of soft dusty brett with a subtle floral bouquet and bready citrus notes. An earthy grass persuasion fiddles around with the aforementioned. Nuanced but subdued with a genuine hf saison bent while the gentle Brett adds an additional fold... Flavors are an amalgamation of different influences: young earthy brett, tangerine citrus, mild grass and floral elixir - none of which take precedence takes over the other. Slight smarty and aspirin note and texture but meshing well with the previously mentioned. Just shy of medium textures with softer but more than adequate carbonation, almost pillowy soft to some degree... Perhaps its our surroundings or our general happiness with being out here on this gorgeous day but it hits just right. My achilles is swollen more than ever before but so what? Birds are chirping and it wont get dark for hours. Id kindly share my pour with a bear or moose at this very moment but perhaps not their young - that just wouldnt sit right with me.  At peace, at ease, and in my element...","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
