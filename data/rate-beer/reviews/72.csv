72,"2016-05-28",3.9,"On tap at Louisville Whole Foods. Black pour
 with a dense brown head. Nose is bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt. Flavor is roast coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and a nice hint of chili warmth in the finish. Palate is full and a little viscous. Pretty good hint of the alcohol punch loaded in this one. Very tasty.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","allfreej"
72,"2015-12-23",3.6,"on tap @ Party Town / Florence KY --- Aroma of sweet fruit and malt. Opaque black color, brown rim head, no lace. Taste is thick syrupy caramel malt that cruises through a nearly fizz-less swallow to a lightly hopped finish. The catch is in the end when, instead of showing alcohol, it shows light, but distinct, hot peppers. A big brew, mostly too heavy for my palate, but balanced and interesting none-the-less.","Lakeside Park, Kentucky, USA","rondphoto"
72,"2015-05-19",4.0,"Draft. this is a fucking winner, not very spicy but a good pepper flavor, mild heat in the backend, really nice porter base as well.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
72,"2015-05-02",3.5,"Draft. Pours pretty black with tan head. Nose is roasty, some ash, coffee, cinnamon. Flavors are very strongly roasted, acrid, ashy tray, nice caramel notes underneath, some cinnamon and vanilla but not much, just hints of peppers. Body is nice and viscous. Very bitter finish. Some smoke. Lay off the black patent and lower the bitterness.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
72,"2015-01-30",5.0,"incredible imperial porter with habanero and chipotle peppers. beautifully smoky, with a nice warming finish from the chile.","Kentucky, USA","tykechandler"
72,"2014-12-17",4.5,"Draft at Republic Calhoun square. Nose is unique and not really my favorite. Black body with the first true brown head I can remember seeing. Excellent lace. Wonderful flavor. Thick, rich and subtlety smokey. Simply outstanding.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
72,"2014-11-21",4.0,"Tap at brewery. Near black with a foamy light brown head that almost completely dissipated. Smokey oak, dark chocolate, light earthiness and mild chilies. Taste is lightly sweet, dry bitterness and a mild spicy finish. Body is heavier with a fizzy feel that carries the spiciness to the back of the throat.","St Paul, Minnesota, USA","Nsanders"
72,"2014-09-15",3.9,"Tap sample. Poured clear dark brown color with an average frothy tan head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate roasted coffee, smoke and chocolate aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth dry texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy dark roasted coffee sweet flavor with medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to long duration. Solid complex beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
72,"2014-09-08",3.9,"Taster on tap at Ei8ht Ball. Pretty much nearly black color. Thin ring of brown head. Some loose dots of lace. Awesome big nose on this. Huge coffee, dark chocolate, roast malt. A nice decent bit of chipotle pepper kick to this, probably the perfect amount. Bigger body. Nice chewiness to it. Could pass for an imperial stout. Maybe just a bit creamier, though. Kind of slick texture. Lighter carbonation. Moderate bitter taste, and a nice pepper kick in the finish. Moderate sweetness. Alcohol is not noticeable beneath the pepper kick. Awesome, interesting stuff.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
72,"2014-08-30",3.5,"Draught at Fest of Ales. Seriously smokey porter. Dark and rich with the pepper blending into the smoke.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
72,"2014-06-14",3.6,"Pours dark with a nice tan head and great lacing. Aroma is roasted malts and light smoke. Taste is chocolate malts, with some more smoke and meat. Burn comes in a few seconds after swallowing, and its just enough to make an impact, but never too much. Probably not something Id buy a pint of again, but its interesting and the alcohol is masked by the peppers.","Minnesota, USA","Ericular"
72,"2014-06-08",3.7,"2 oz. or smaller pour, on tap at St. Paul Summer Beer Fest. Consumed on 6-7-14. Pours dark brown with tan head. Smoky aroma features scents of baked or fried peppers and bacon. Malty flavor features pepper, coffee, and dark chocolate. Spicy taste that reminds me of a breakfast burrito. Medium to full body. Smooth in the palate. Good beer!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
72,"2014-05-31",4.1,"Draft at the brewery. Black pour with a nice tan head. Roasted malty nose. Malty, bitter chocolate then a perfect amount of heat and pepper character. Finishing warm and a touch hoppy. Very good.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
72,"2013-12-04",3.8,"Tap. Aroma of chocolate. Taste is sweet then happy then spicy. Nice finish. Nice lively mouth feel. Good beer.","Minnesota, USA","wilnatp"
72,"2013-11-13",3.8,"Pour on tap at APN 2013, dark brownish black pour with tan head, aroma brought big dark chocolate, coffee, and roast, slight vanilla bean, hints of caramel, the chili notes come through slightly as well, pretty nice. Taste is a mix of dark chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, some slight oaky, smoky notes into nice sweet chili, the heat gently backs it at the end.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
72,"2013-10-27",3.9,"Black color with a large head. Aroma of chocolate and roasted barley with a hint of pepper. Big chocolate and roast flavor, some coffee. Amazingly enough, the pepper is very subdued and I really didnt notice heat until towards the end of the glass, and even then it was pretty mild. A little smoky after warming, but Im not sure if its peppers or peat, or both. My god... one of only three pepper beers that I not only dont despise, but actually enjoy!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
72,"2013-09-02",4.0,"Sampled on draught at All Pints North in Duluth, MN. Pours an opaque dark brown colored brew with a thick tan head that has some excellent retention and lacing. Aroma of toasted dark chocolate malt, some beef jerky, a hint of peat and light green vegetable. Taste is full bodied, soft carbonation with flavors of toasted chocolate malt, floral hops, a hint of peat, some alcohol presence and chipotle peppers. Finish is quite smooth without the pepper bite. Still, flavors of both Habanero and Chipotle peppers, chocolate malt and some smoked peat continues in the finish. A lot of multi-personallity going on here depending on Thors temperature. More black licorice when allowed to warm up.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
72,"2013-08-02",4.0,"On tap at brewery! Pours black brown with a thin creamy tan head that settles to a soapy wispy film and little lacing. Aroma has some roasted peat smoked malt some bitter hops and lingering faint pepper. Taste is bitter and smokey with roasted malt and the pepper starts to kick in, and has a really nice balance. Palate is medium maybe slightly slick and finishes with a warming mix of pepper and alcohol. Pretty tasty!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"
72,"2013-07-27",3.7,"Sample at APN. Really a cool beer actually. Nice roasted malts, chocolate and an awesome warm, peppery finish. Really mixed up the day nicely.","Robbinsdale, Minnesota, USA","TheHOFF43"
