1870,"2016-10-18",3.6,"Very hazy amber and copper coloured body with a thin, single centimetre tall off-white head. Aroma of peaches, apricots, alcohol, wheat, grain and more fruits - very nice and fairly low key. Medium-bodied; Dense malty flavour with some fruits, nuts, earth and more pungency from the lager yeast. Medium-bodied; Assertive nutty and earthy flavours with a big peach and apricot flavour showing some bitterness and funk coupled with a bit of the grain. Aftertaste shows some pungent alcohol notes, some light fruit flavours and a lot of malt, which is relatively surprising, given the style. Overall, a good and very flavourful lager with a ton of fruit flavours and nice maltiness. Great to sample, and a good option should you want a full-bodied and full-flavoured lager in the summertime!

1870,"2016-05-30",2.7,"Darker hue of golden. Fleeting white head. Uninviting nose of wet bread, grape candy, floral hops, cereal flakes, nuts, and paintlike yeast. Restrained carbonation. Grapelike notes abound on entry and are exacerbated by a sting of alcohol and a sweetness that teeters on medicinal. Limp, poorly defined malt shows faint nutty edges, but is devoid of melanoidins and shows more of a wet bread effect than anything. Hints of apple juice heighten the incessant sugars and flabby malt. Strong prickle of alcohol, throughout. Hops are softly floral, though fail to alleviate the sugary fatigue. Sweet and alcoholic finish contains notes of honeyed white bread and floral suggestions. A rather predictable heller bock that lacks the bright hops and melanoidiny punch I seek in the style. Would love to see more minerals, as well.

The flavor profile is near world class. It is intense, rather complex and fairly well balanced. A bit more malt sweetness to balance the hops would yield a world class flavor rating. It begins with herbal hop flavor over a mild biscuit sweetness. As the middle approaches, light caramel notes emerge. The middle brings a mild bitterness over a slight mineral like note.

1870,"2014-12-30",4.0,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours a beautiful golden color. The head is about a finger high, and white in shade. The texture is rather frothy and inconsistent, while retention is only average. However, some streaks of lacing are left behind on the glass. Generally, this is a good-looking offering.

S: Theres a lot going on with the aroma. At first, Im picking up various fruity notes (apples, lemon, maybe even some melon) backed with some subtle baked bread. Letting it open up, and some grassy hops will appear. Everything seems nicely balanced, well integrated, and defined. This proves you dont need to be a massive Galaxy-hopped DIPA or bourbon-barrel aged imperial stout with coconut to have a great aroma.

T: Subtle hoppiness hits the palate first - both grassy and a little herbaceous. Malt flavors surge after the hops fade (slightly) with caramel, baked bread, and apple. Id even suggest this beer tastes a bit like apple pie. Its best feature is its balance: this could have easily been too sweet, but the hops helps to give it a ballasting bitterness, while still allowing the defined malt flavors to shine through. Maybe its not complex per se, but I dont care about that.

M: The crisp, dry finish helps to neutralize any excess lingering sweetness on the palate. There is a good amount of body to help give it both substance and a long-lasting finish (in spite of the dryness), but it still goes down disturbingly easy. Carbonation is nearly perfect.

O: Gorgeous, gorgeous beer. I had high expectations for this, and they were met easily. While everything is balanced well, its the former combined with the flavor definition that makes it the winner it is. Hold on, let me drink another to see if Im right about this one...yep, dead-on about this.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"
1870,"2014-10-12",3.8,"Transfer from BA review on 3-3-14-

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a golden amber color with tons of big carbonation bubbles seen streaming up through the brew and with a small fizzy white head. The head fades quite fast leaving a light level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma of the beer is strongest of a big bready smell. With the bready smells are some big aromas of toffee as well as a decent sum of a lighter fruit smell. The fruit aromas are mainly of apricot, peach and plum and with bit of a doughy and grassy smell rounding out the aroma, the smell is overall a nice blend of sweet and malt.

 Taste  The taste begins with a thick doughy and bready flavor with lots of caramel sweetness right from the start. The caramel takes on more and more buttery flavors as the taste advances producing a toffee like taste. Along with the caramel to toffee transition, so too come some hop flavors of a light grassy and moderate earthy flavor growing more intense as the flavor advances. A light graininess and a little bit of grape and pear come to the tongue at the very end of the taste, leaving a nice, lightly hopped, very sweet, and malty flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier then would have been expected for a brew of 6.9 % abv with a carbonation level that is rather average. The thick and creamy body are fantastic for all the big sweet toffee and doughy flavors of the brew, coating the mouth in all the nice malt and sweet flavors.

 Overall  A rather sweet, but still just enough hopped and balanced Helles Bock. Due to the thicker body and big sweeter and bready flavors, it is a rather slow drinker all while only at 6.9 % abv.","","Darkmagus82"

Aroma: The nose of this one is strong lemon with some doughy/bready malts

Palate: The body is light-medium, with a strong carbonation, and a lightly dry, tingly finish

That lingering spice flavor on the end leads to an unpleasant astringency. An alcohol warming sensation is noticeable. Overall, it's ok.

S - Smells of light noble hop bitterness, doughy yeast, lightly toasted caramel malt and a bit of dulled lemon. Rather plain initially but it comes around a bit as it warms up.


T - Starts off with a mix of bready malt, yeast and mild caramel malt sweetness slowly giving way to the noble hop bitterness. Finish is pretty doughy with some light bitterness, lingering long after the finish.


M - Light body with moderate carbonation. Smooth, doughy feel with some mild bitterness at the end of each sip. Booze is hidden quite well.


O - A pretty solid maibock all things considered. A bit more hoppy than a traditional example but that was what they were going for here. I will definitely enjoy a few more of these once it warms up some more.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

Lots of grain and bread in the aroma. The flavor has a nice bit of the grain balanced with the hops for a light yet very tasty and crisp feel.

1870,"2014-02-23",3.3,"12oz bottle. Totally clear orange color. Thin white head. Leaves decent reaches of lace. Medium to bigger body. Kind of crisp and smooth lighter carbonation. Lightly slick. Bready, grainy flavor. Lightly toasty. A clean lagery bready flavor. A light bit of piney, lightly zesty hop. Moderate to bigger bitter taste, moderate sweet taste. Solid, moderately hoppy hells bock. Doesnt go too outside the box as far as aromatics, hop profile isnt too distracting. Just a solid example of the style.
