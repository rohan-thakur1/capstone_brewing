3159,"2017-02-21",3.9,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is full of chardonnay notes with lots of golden raisin, green grape, and tropical fruit. Lighter oak notes and tannins. Light stone fruit esters. Some medium light grassy and herbal phenolic notes. 
Pours a fairly clear, golden orange color with a medium sized, medium thick, white head that recedes somewhat quickly to the edges where it lingers briefly before disappearing. No lacing and faint legs. 
Flavor is moderately acidic with a light sharpness to it. There is a light sweetness with hints of grain. Moderate chardonnay notes with golden raisins, green grapes, unripe tropical fruit and melon. Some light oak notes and tannins. Light stone fruit and floral esters. Light grassy phenolic notes. Low bitterness. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice, rather tart saison with a lot of barrel and wine character. The base beer shows through a bit, but this is pretty barrel forward. A bit more acidity and a bit too sharp for my preferences in a saison.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

3159,"2015-02-20",4.0,"750 ml bottle via trade. Pours a cloudy orange-gold color with a small off-white head. Notes of grape skins, oak, leather, lime, lemon, and cheesecloth. Light-bodied, with a tart, dry mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. More tartness and dryness than the Pinot Noir version, and not as rounded nor sweet. On the same level, though; excellent duo of collaborations.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3159,"2015-02-16",4.1,"750ml bottle, thanks to phaleslu for sharing. Hazy orange amber color. Thin ring of white head. Great bigger sour taste... bigger sourness than the pinot version of this beer, that I just tasted. Love the big sourness. Fantastic oaky, mild dark fruit, some creme, mild vinous. Love the flavor and taste on this.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
3159,"2014-11-30",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 14, 2014 Bottle from a trade with Aaron, thanks man! Split 4 ways. Pour is fairly cloudy orange with no head whatsoever. Nose explodes with loads of tropical fruits, mangoes, peaches and some grape. Taste is really smooth, with light funk, still lots of tropical fruits. Mouthfeel is light citric in a pleasant way. Really good stuff!","Aarhus, DENMARK","bursprak"
3159,"2014-11-28",4.3,"Thanks to Bursprak for bringing this. Pours a cloudy amber with no head. Aroma is citrusy forward with lots of tropical notes as well. I got some mango, citrus, peach, green grapes, goose berries and behind this you get the delicate white wine qualities which constitute a a nice balance. There is also some funk in the aroma as well. Taste is quite citric with tropical citrus fruits, white wine, mango, goose berries, apple cider vinegar and some weak funk. Very fruity forward with a nice dry barrel character. This is truly delicious !","Aarhus, DENMARK","RasmusOtt"
3159,"2014-11-27",4.2,"Bottle. Thanks Bursprak! Pours hazy orange with no head. Aromas of horse blanket funkiness, tropical fruits, mango, wild strawberries, citrus, slight hop fruityness.

Very smooth body, medium carbonation.","Aarhus N, DENMARK","Klimaet"
3159,"2014-11-27",4.3,"Bottle thanks to Erik. Pours hazy, orange amber. Almost no head. Aroma has lots of fruits. Citrus/lemon, acidic wild strawberries, grapes and exotic fruits like peach and mango. Slight hoppy, some oak and some funk. Taste has that crisp citrus sourness up front, with a dry, oaky bitterness following. Very fruity and complex despite the absence of fruit. Slight wheaty, and some slight leather. Crisp body with tickling carbonation. Really exiting and good!","Aarhus C, DENMARK","Vestergaard"
3159,"2014-09-14",4.2,"750ml bottle pours hazy pale orange with small head. Nose is big horsey funk, musty barn, opens up into a more well rounded tart tangy citrus and rustic grain with nice stonefruit. Taste is nice big tart acidic stonefruit with a round rustic grain and dough backbone, all balanced out with funky barn wet hay and horse notes and old musty wood. Finish is tart juicy stonefruit, nicely balanced acidity, some yeast funk, citrus, musty wood.","Hampton Roads, Virginia, USA","JBPortland"
3159,"2014-09-14",4.4,"Bottle shared thanks to JBPortland ! Pours a hazy orange golden color with a finger of gaseous bubbles. Nose is a bit murky swamp and low tide with layers of stonefruit and vinous acidity. The palate is delicious with great interplay of tangerine, peach, nectarine that starts out soft and then gets all juicy and bright... as it dries out some light marzipan and toasted oak notes move in and soften the finish. Delicious !","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
3159,"2014-09-08",4.2,"Bottle from brewery, Tillamook. Pours a pale coppery color, little bit of head. Aroma is stellar, funky with some coppery notes and grape character, too. Musty, oaky, bright.

3159,"2014-08-25",4.2,"On tap at the tasting room in Tillamook. Wow! Thats a funky beer. Beautiful burnt orange color, almost no head, no lacing. Aroma very complex, with sourness up front, of course, but tropical fruit, white wine, strong funky cheese, and more that I cant really describe not far behind. Taste was similar - not overpoweringly sour, slightly sweet, and still with a readily detectable saison taste just behind the sourness. Its a bit on the thin side, but not so much that it really put a damper on my enjoyment of this beer. Best beer I tried that day. One of the best beers Ive ever had!","Corvallis, Oregon, USA","thepilferer"

3159,"2014-08-17",4.0,"Thanks, Brian!

Pouring a clear copper with a dense, off-white head with excellent retention and nice lacing, this looks great. The nose is surprisingly subdued but leans on a blend of funk and grass with some white wine incorporated in there. Not as buttery as some of the other Chardonnay barrel-aged butter bombs Ive had. Mildly sulfury, moderately grainy and with a pleasant spice character; a blend of clove and a little plastic with some white pepper. Dried lemon peel, a moderate lactic acid bite and a faint barnyard note are present. Nice stuff.

The palate opens bright, tart, clean and refreshing with a blend of yogurt, lemon peel and a bit of clove. This is followed by a juicy mid-palate showcasing a blend of honey, white wine and fruit (apricots and melons). Maybe some juniper too? Drying, snappy and crisp of the finish with a really refreshing blend of yogurt, cleansing lactic acid and brightening citrus, this beer is light in body, crisply carbonated and a treat on the palate. Highly recommended.","Oregon, USA","dyan"
3159,"2014-08-13",4.3,"On tap at the De Garde 1st anniversary party.

A - pours dark a orange honey with zero head. No lacing. S - really nice nose, it's a smorgasbord of awesome. Bretts, Chardonnay, pineapple/lemon juice, catty hops, cheese funk (oh that de garde funk!). Prickly, tart, funky. Oh so good. M - sharp almost sour upfront. Weaker palate than the nose. Simple lemony tartness on the end. T - everything I want from a de garde sour! A combo of catty hops, Chardonnay, lemon juice and a hint of pineapple, musty oak, and de garde cheesy yogurt funk. O - the nose is a 10, the taste not quite so. glad I got to try these. Great beer and a great party.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
3159,"2014-08-11",3.5,"Bottle shared with GT2. Thank you Brian! Clear, deep orange pour, small spotty lacing. Aroma is grassy, hoppy, citrus, nectarine, fresh earth/ petrichor. Taste is quite sour, definitely not saison anymore. Hoppy, a bit weird with the hoppy bitterness and big sourness. Conflicting ideas (hop, saison, sour) that makes it hard for me to wrap my head around. Fruit punch type finish. Body feels watery overall, like a really good lambic was watered down. Dissolved cherry tablets in there somewhere. Couldnt get down.","Oceanside, California, USA","biggirlpanties"
3159,"2014-08-11",4.1,"> Lambic + Saison blend with guava, red grapefruit, tamarind, navel orange, and dry hop character
[ Bottle ][ 75cl ][ brainlair ][ Trade/Gift ][ Reidel Vinum XL Pinot Noir ][ 8.11.14 ]
>> Thank you Brian! Pours a clear, deep deep orange with medium yellowish foam and lots of stringy lacing. Nose is really off the chain- essentially 3F/Girardin type lambic funk with huge red grapefruit, leather, moving to something quite ripe like tamarind and guava paste...some odd squashiness comes from what I assume is dry hopping. Juicy navel orange juice, vanilla, pomelo, enormously complex with depth. Taste begins light and refreshing with seltzer bubbles, orange juice, and lime. Thin mouthfeel. Mid palate is pretty much pure citric acid, but it isnt lacerating or overpowering. A tad too citric for me in the backend but has some saving big grapefruit leather piling on through the finish. Body is ultra light- reminds me of a saison + unblended lambic that has been dry hopped. Has undertones of Cantillon Iris and the like. So, yeah, thats a surefire way to win my heart. So different from the other Saison Desays that is seems a bit silly to even name this beer Desay. Flash of butteriness as it gets warms.
