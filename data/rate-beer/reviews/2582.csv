2582,"2017-05-23",3.3,"Sample during the ""Local Love 02"" tasting on 05/05/2017. The beer is a dark copper-amber color with a medium thick light beige head that recedes gradually to a film. Small patches of lacing on the glass. Aroma of dark fruit, yeast and grainy malt. Medium body with flavors of fruity yeast, earthy mushroom, malt and oak. The finish is fruity and malty with an earthy and slightly metallic aftertaste. Decent overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
2582,"2014-06-30",2.8,"750 ml bottle from the brewery, shared at RBSGs grand tasting. Pours a mostly clear, deep golden-orange with a big, fizzy off-white head. The sour mash gives it a bit of a puky, cheesy aroma, with some nectar and citrus fruits, sugars, musty funk, oak, and dusty paper. Light-medium bodied, with low carbonation and a sour, malty mouthfeel. Not really my thing. Not sure if its the style or what.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
2582,"2014-04-01",3.5,"Bottle shared by alexsdad06 pours dark gold with orange hue. Nose pleasant light sour, tart fruit, sweet malt. Taste tart up front, some sour, mid palate light funk with some tannin from the oak. Some sweet transition to sour in finish.","Loveland, Ohio, USA","drsordr"
2582,"2014-01-16",3.5,"Tinny malt nose. Hazy amber, thick firm head. Tart persimmon and white grape flavor with oaky accents. White grape is more prominent on the back end. Alcohol well concealed, clean. Very enjoyable and the story behind it is interesting.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
2582,"2014-01-03",4.0,"Growler. Tart cherry and caramel malt aroma with slight hint of bourbon. Hazy amber with small head. Sweet tart cherry/apple, oak, and caramel malt flavor. Nice body. Very tasty.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
2582,"2013-12-31",4.6,"Bottle: purchased at taproom
Pours fizzy, bubbly amber-orange with a short, off-white head.
Aroma is initially a whiff of vinegar, then white wine, oak barrel, yellow apple, vanilla....
Taste is just as exquisite....tart apple, sweet grape...a little funkiness...
This one really hits all the right notes with me....and Im not a big sour fan...but this beer is spectacular.....I bet I spent 3-4 minutes just breathing it in and out with my nose plunged into the glass.....just superb.......","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"
2582,"2013-12-15",4.0,"Bottle shared by DrSilverworm. Pours a darker brown with a beige head of foam. Aroma is tart with notes of oak and cherries. Taste is fairly sour. I enjoyed it.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
2582,"2013-11-17",4.3,"Shared by the kick ass guys from TD/Listermann! pours a nice brown color, light tan head. Flavors are sweet/tart. Some good fruity notes, toasted oak, light vanilla notes, tart more than sweet. Damn good stuff.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"

Thanks to b3shine for sharing this less common style. I have had a couple of these ""Kentucky Commons"" and they are underrated in my opinion. This one might not be the best but with a limited sample size I will take any that I can get. Once again Listermann comes through with a winner.

Aroma / Appearance - The cloudy base is the color of orange marmalade. A wisp of bubbly head fades away as a mixture of sour mash, dusty cardboard, oranges, and caramel rise up.

Flavor / Palate - Sour mash, sweet vinegar, and a strong tartness rinse away everything like a blast of sandpaper. This does not have much depth but does not need it. A typical example of the regional style is worth drinking once or twice. I will definitely grab a few more of the lighter Listermann beers the next time I go through the area.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
2582,"2013-10-26",3.5,"750ml bottle, shared by tmoney99. Hazy orange golden color. Minimal off-white head. Good, oaky, lightly funky nose. Some woody orange citrus notes. Kind of musty, lambic-like, almost. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, soft texture, but carbonation is in check here. Lightly dry finish. Light bitter, moderate sour taste. Some lemon - citrus notes. Enjoyable sour. I liked this one. More refreshing and easy-drinking, more bright than the gin-rum version, I think.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
2582,"2013-10-24",3.7,"750 ml bottle shared by Tmoney99. Pours a cloudy golden brown color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have a sweet / sour thing going on. Sticky sweet malts with some sour citrus which is probably more tart than sour. Easy drinking, intro type sour.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
2582,"2013-10-24",3.8,"750 ml bottle to taster (shared by Tmoney99). Looks good; a glossy golden orange with white lacing. Smells good too; tart, oaky, and funky with notes of fruit and malt. Tastes like it smells, but not as robust and without the fruit. Good on the palate. Enjoyable.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
2582,"2013-09-27",4.0,"Bottle sample. Poured a clear dark golden color with an average frothy white head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy sour grain, alcohol and wood aroma. Medium to full body with a sticky tingly texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy sour & sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet & sour finish of moderate to long duration with a small alcohol burn. This is a standout beer for style.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
