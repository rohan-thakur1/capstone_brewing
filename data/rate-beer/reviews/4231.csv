4231,"2016-11-14",4.3,"375 ml bottle into chalice, best before 1/21/2021. Pours very hazy/cloudy very dark brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge tart raspberry, raisin, prune, plum, fig, date, apricot, apple, pepper, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, toasted brown bread, vanilla, cream, bourbon, oak, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of raspberries/lactose, fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light-moderate bourbon barrel notes, with great strength. Taste of huge tart raspberry, raisin, prune, plum, fig, date, apricot, apple, pepper, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, toasted brown bread, vanilla, cream, bourbon, oak, and yeast earthiness. Moderate tannic fruit tartness and yeast/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart raspberry, raisin, prune, plum, fig, date, apricot, apple, pepper, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, toasted brown bread, vanilla, cream, bourbon, oak, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of raspberries/lactose, fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light-moderate bourbon barrel flavors; with a great malt/tart/spiciness balance; with zero cloying sweetness or astringent fruit flavors after the finish. Light dryness from tart/tannic fruit and yeast/oak spice, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy, lightly slick/syrupy, and acidic/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden, a light warmth lingering after the finish; with zero booziness. Overall this is an incredible fruited quadrupel style! All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of raspberries/lactose, fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light-moderate bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and easy to sip on for the huge ABV. Enormous amounts of fruit presence, but still has an awesome underlying base quad. All of the intense flavors overwhelm a lot of the barrel notes, but there is still solid presence. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
