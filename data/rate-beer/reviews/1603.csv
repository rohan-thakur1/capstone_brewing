1603,"2015-12-13",3.7,"14%ABV. Ginjo Sake

Nose had some sweet rice cakes. There was a very subtle funk to the nose with aroma of fresh steamed rice cakes made with fermented rice flour. There was a nutty sweetness to the nose as well suggesting chestnuts and dried acorns. There was an overall clean candy nose.

Mouthfeel was watery and alcoholic. The palate which was dominated by alcohol and given a mildly warming of the throat was brief followed by the following flavors: sweet rice gruel, a fruity slightly citrus flavor with mild bitterness suggesting yuzu and yuzu peel. Some fruity sweetness with a slightly rich and decadent flavor like fresh persimmons. 

Clean finish and palate.","SINGAPORE","drjoeng"

1603,"2014-03-13",3.4,"Served chilled fresh from an unopened bottle, this Sake pours perfectly clear and smooth, impressive. Smell is faint and clean, fresh sweet aroma. The taste is mildly sweet, subtly a bit fruity, but also allows the grainy rice flavor to come through. Also what I suppose is the yeasty taste of koji. I enjoy this flavor profile over the gekkeikan junmai ginjo I sampled previously, which was a bit too sweet. However, I was bit disappointed that the taste was not more flavorful, could've been stronger. At any rate, seemed to be an authentic Japanese offering.","South Carolina, USA","eRock_2013"
1603,"2013-03-24",3.4,"Bottle shared with my wife.  Pours clear with the smallest hint of gold to it.  Big sweet rice, chewy yeast, a touch of warm alcohol, bread.  Medium bodied, warm rice, touches of banana.  Sweet and simple, warmth on the finish and a bit of yeast.  Decent enough.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

1603,"2012-01-31",2.1,"Bottle. No head (still). Body is colorless. Aroma is notes of grain/rice, alcohol (slightly fusel, e.g. acetone), glue, mold. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, slightly unclean. Light to medium body, watery texture, no carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic, lightly astringent.  Wow, this reminds me of the Simpsons episode where they showed all three Duff beers coming out of the same pipe.  This is practically identical to the plain Junmai.  Bog standard cheap sake nose, slightly fusel.  Yawn.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

1603,"2008-05-29",2.9,"Pours absolutely crystal clear.  Could easily be mistaken for water, save for a more substantial, viscous body.  The sharp nose shows a good deal of dry, grainy alcohol, with hints of cardboard and distant notes of licorice.  Theres a fumy, sort of latex overtone as well.  Flavors improved slightly, showing notes of vanilla vodka and a touch of cream amidst the dry, papery background.  Medium-bodied and semi-dry.  Overall, a touch too alcoholic and strange for my liking.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1603,"2008-04-12",2.9,"Not really a fan of this one. Pours a clear color with almost no legs. Nose is yeast and rice with some oxidization (paper) and a tinge of melon. Not so great on the balance and the finish is very gross and off putting. Was not a fan.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
1603,"2008-03-26",3.4,"Bottle: Pours a rather thick clear color, maybe a hint of egg-shell white or bone through the pellucid innards. The nose is a little sharp with rice granules and yeast esters. Grainy koji along with the beginnings of sweet melon, kiwi and cardboard. A bit papery for my liking but theres some anise and fennel that compliment it nicely. Good chilled on up to room temp. Very middle of the road with a thick masculine mouthfeel.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"

1603,"2007-01-06",3.9,"Clear in color. Virtually no aroma (served chilled to 50 degrees). Extremely smooth with delightful flavor of vanilla and mild spice, finishing with sweetness and a little citrus.  Will go well with sushi or sashimi.  A great value ($6.99 for 300 ml).","USA","pnesbitt"
1603,"2006-08-11",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 27, 2007 Pours clear. The bouquet is fruity w/ a musty character. It lays across the palate with a medium body. This is a  fruity style with a unique and well defined bamboo earthiness with a touch of sulfer. Very complex indeed. The finish is long and fruity. Like all good sake serve it chilled.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"

1603,"2005-11-01",3.0,"Had at sushi bar in Hurst, TX:  I definetely have a long way to go in terms of rating sake.  I probably have a long ways to go in regards to rating beer too, but that is another story.  Beverage pours totally clear.  Aroma is highly alcoholic.  Flavor is multi-layered with soy sauce, juniper, and alcohol.","Bedford, Texas, USA","TChrome"
1603,"2005-08-16",3.0,"It looks very good, if the appearance of water in a glass excites you.  Not being a sake guy, I voted that straight down the middle.  The aroma is a very mild vanilla, which is a strong scent in most worlds but this, with what I believe Im identifying as steamy rice.  (Never detected that in a sake before.)  I grade that a notch above average.  The flavor begins fruity (banana, mango?), then turns to perfume about half way through.  The former I like, the latter calls for mouthwash - so Im back in the middle with my vote. The palate is smooth and somewhat oily, easy to drink, so Ill go up a point from center.  The finish is hot, peppery, and the alcohol is evident... all of which boots my over-all to twelve.  Hey!

1603,"2005-07-13",3.8,"2004 or 2005 bottle from the Organic Co-op in Belfast, ME.  Consumed 7/1/2005.  Huge legs on the glass, very three dimensional and lasting.  Clearer than water!!  Talking with Buch_Dich about these Junmai Ginjos, he did seem to agree with me that these can start to run together and get difficult to differentiate from one another (myself being no expert on the subtleties of sake).  So I seem to get the usual coconut milk and mashed, boiled rice in the nose and flavor.  Light springwater and vanilla in both the nose and flavor.  This one had something spicy on the finish, I have no idea what.  Hard to describe, maybe something lightly herbal.  Extremely clean and with an exceptionally low amount of alcohol apparency, its clearly quite high quality.  This one did seem to have a meatier texture than most, with lots of body and light sweetness.  Quite drinkable, and deceivably strong at 14%.  Quite enjoyable.  Dry on the end, as I have found this style to be.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1603,"2005-05-24",3.5,"Enjoyed this at NYCs restaurant Spice over pad thai, so not sure how accurate this rating is.  A slight alcohol bite, but overall mild and lightly floral.  Moderate quality, Id say.  Very clear in the glass with some warming in the throat.  Some aromas, but not much.  Fairly decent quality, it seemed.  Freshness not in doubt, as I opened a sealed 300ml bottle.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
