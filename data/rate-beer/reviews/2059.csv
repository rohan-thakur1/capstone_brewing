Al palato il corpo è watery, con una carbonazione non eccessiva ma che nasconde bene i suoi 7 gradi alcolici. Al gusto però è carente, con lievi sentori zesty e speziati, seguiti da note erbacee con un finale poco amaro. Sorso secco senza persistenza ma che lascia il palato pulito, con un po di salinità finale.","Vallata, SUD ITALIA, ITALY","Diabobale"

2059,"2014-08-06",3.1,"Typical, commissioned bière de garde that won a bronze medal on a contest for French regional products. Upon opening the bottle, I was confronted with one of the most serious cases of gushing Ive ever seen - it kept litterally flowing for minutes. After having managed to catch some beer in my tulip tasting glass, the foam staid firm and rocky for a long time. The beer itself had a cloudy ochre blonde colour and an aroma of green apple, dried apricot, pineapple, melon, lemon peel, lavender, soap, bark, ginger... Soft grainy taste, bit neutral at first, gentle honeyish malt sweetness, subtle fruitiness, spicy yeast accents becoming more bready towards the end and finishing in a late, leafy hop bitterness, thought the long dry ending also has to do with the strong carbonation, related to the gushing phenomenon. Not the best bière de garde I ever had, but the spectacular gushing did create some excitement, at least...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

2059,"2013-01-03",4.0,"Aroma has quite a bit of a pale sweet malt character with the graininess of pilsner malt and a touch of a pale malt aroma. Balanced phenolics and esters. The phenolics are mostly clove with a touch of peppercorn as it warms. The esters are banana, floral and a touch of citrus. 
Pours a slightly cloudy golden straw with a thin white head that recedes very quickly. No head retention and no lacing. 
The sweet malt flavors hit immediately. Lots of pilsner an background pale notes. Behind that this beer is an ester bomb. Lots of pear, citrus and banana. Also very floral and a bit cidery. Low to no hop flavor and low to medium low bitterness. No alcohol flavor. A touch of astringency way back in the finish. Phenolics are less noticeable in the flavor but there is a hint of clove. A touch of a hard water mineral flavor. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with high carbonation. Astringency is very low and alcohol warmth is low. 
Overall I really like this beer and the style. Perhaps the esters in the flavor could be a bit lower, and more balanced with the phenolics but this is really nicely done. Easy drinking though a touch sweet.

2059,"2012-10-22",3.9,"Golden peach in color. Fat, rocky white head clings to the glass after each gulp. Lovely perfumey nose of potpourri, cracker dough, honey-drizzled hay, lemon balm, apricot, cotton candy, and spicy, anise-tinged hops. Plenty of minerals, musty cellar and peppery phenols, as well. Expansive carbonation. Dry crackery malt initially accompanies the airy, well-attenuated body which paves the way for slicker honeydew and a quenching lemony twang interlaced with a succulent floral hop burst. Intricate yeast-derived nuances deliver solid depth. Dry as a bone, yet far from stark or hollow, as dabs of cotton candy gel with a twist of juicy hops and bright fruity esters to fill out the bodys core. Apricot and pineapple aplenty, along with a pillowy banana cream pie effect from the yeast and piecrusty malt. Well-textured malt also aids the body with its palate-hugging starches. Finishes soft and dry with a beautifully balanced interplay of juicy, lightly herbal hops, brawny yet clean Pils malt, and musty yeast. Hugely appetizing afterimage of gently warming alcohol and peppery phenols. The predominant character of musty cellar draws instant parallels to Castelain Blond Biere and Bière des Sans Culottes, though  this exhibits considerably more depth and less hollowness than those examples. I must say this is very saisonlike in its complex ester and phenol profile, zippy hoppiness, and subtle tartness. Either way a thoroughly enjoyable contemplative quaffer!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

2059,"2012-04-04",3.7,"Bottle from West Lakeview. Served in a Moeder Lambic tulip.

Pours a clear dark straw color with a nice white head. Good retention and a nice collar after the cap finally fades away. Some spotty lacing on the sides of the glass.

The nose carries a bit of light pilsner malt up front, followed by a touch of flowers and some perfume notes. Finally, theres just a bit of pepper and earth on the back end.

The flavor follows up on the nose quite well, with the addition of some slight hop character, not as much in the flavor as in a backing bitterness, which creates a semi-dry finish. The floral and perfume notes are more prominent in the flavor, especially as it warms up a bit.

Medium body with carbonation that is a touch on the low end, especially considering the pop of the cork when I opened this thing. The finish is quite nice and more than makes up for it. Theres just a touch of residual sweetness through the finish.

The nose is based in fresh, sweet, honey-kissed bread dough and drier cereal grain, with a spicy, floral, peppery yeast overtone and notes of lemongrass hops. It reminds me a lot of Fantôme Pissenlit with a less-funky, less minty yeast profile. Flavors are noticeably more dry and crisp, the lively, champagne-like carbonation intensifying the zippy, floral-grassy hops and doughy yeast. Dandelions and other windflowers come to mind.

2059,"2011-03-14",3.8,"Bottle. Listed as Au Baron Brasserie (Gussignies, France) Cuvee des Jonquilles Biere de Garde (7%). Rating is from a practice BJCP Scoresheet. I was scoring it in the biere de garde category (16D). The numbers in this rating reflect ratebeers hedonistic scale and not my judging numbers. 
Aroma: Grassy, toasty, lightly herbal and peppery with some clove notes. A bit musty, candied ginger, toasty malt aromas. Leans a bit more to the spicy yeast character exhibited by saisons. Complex and delicate interaction of yeast and malt with moderate esters. 
Flavor: Bready, malty, toasty, light musty character with faint esters. Grassy and spicy (attributable to both the hops and pils malt) in the finish. Hops character is low as is the bitterness. Lingering balance of fermentation character and malt complexities. Light pear and other fruit notes linger. Nice crispness. Quite dry with a noticeable farmhouse fermentation character. 
Mouthfeel: Very high and lively carbonation (nearly harshly so), very light warmth. Dry on the finish. Strong carbonic bite. No astringencies. Like a good farmhouse ale it feels refreshing and vibrant. 
Overall Impression: A very good farmhouse ale that treads the lines between a saison and a biere de garde. Nice, vibrant and refreshing with strong fermentation characters (lightly estery, lightly phenolic, lightly musty). Could do with a slightly more pronounced malt character to fit better into the BdG category. A very well crafted beer.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

2059,"2009-04-22",4.1,"A huge pop upon the opening surprises for what seems to be a rather old beer. The musty, lightly oxidized aroma also hints at dryness to come and delicate spicy yeastiness, so much that beyond the negative first impression, we are quickly won. An old treasure lies beyond those cobwebs. Very herbal and most of all, incredibly put together hops. Delicious hallertauer, done perfectly - spot on as I like them with a floweriness you want to suck on, a glass you could never tire of all paired with that musty yeast. This is between burgerbraus wolnzacher hell in top shape and de rankes guldenberg or a softened xx bitter. Spotty powderiness, likely from the lack of freshness and a redundant grainy maltiness are the only factors to keep it away from a 10, and this was done mostly on hops alone.

2059,"2009-01-09",3.9,"<b>In short: </b>A somewhat wild/barnyard beer with a over-the-top floral character.  Very original and quite delicious.
<b>How: </b>Bottle 750ml, 2 ½ year old bottle.  Tasting session with Montreal crew.
<b>The look: </b>Cloudy dirty yellow body topped by a medium white head
<b>In long: </b>Nose is very floral with dandelions, mint and a bunch of wild and garden flowers.  Barnyard character present in the aroma and taste.  Taste has the same floral character but is also very sharp with a medium astringency and acidity.  Pineapples, citrus and lemon join in the party.  Despite the age of the bottle (over 2 years old) I had the feeling that what I was tasting was exactly the intended result.  A truly original beer unlike anything youve had before.  Unless you had a Cuvée des Jonquilles before, in which case it is a truly original beer just like something youve had before.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2059,"2008-10-26",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 18, 2012 My Bottom Line:
Dandelion-like floral character emanates from the marriage of doughy yeast and spicy hops, while seemingly barnyard-malted cereals fluff this Bière de Gardes already cushiony mouthfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the hazy straw blond.
-Spicy hop bitterness is delicate and surrounded by the earthy yeast character.
-A subtle fruitiness dabbles within the tropical territory (bananas, citrus).
-This might be in the same range of authenticity as Blaugies Saisons.
-The best before date is clearly too early. This can age at least a year or two after this date, if we rely on this batch of course.
-This smells like countryside. It just does.

2059,"2008-09-13",4.1,"750 ml bottle from Cave a Bulles.  Hazy pale golden yellow beer with a creamy white head.  Very highly carbonated with a cork that shot straight out like a bullet.  Lovely looking beer with a thick white head and an equally appealing aroma.  Softly crackery with a soft fresh fruitiness.  Some light apricot and a touch of dank cellery character.  Just a kiss of light spiciness and citrus with a soft herbal note.  Warming the spicy/herbal notes really pick up and the beer comes into its own.  This could easily pass for a saison and a damn fine one at that.  Very perfumey aroma that invites continuing contemplation.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

Nice aroma, dry and spicy, with a touch of citrus, like a Saison. The body is medium-thin, even if the carbonation is almost gone in the explosion; it has a lean flavor, with the Saison-like spices, but lacking on body, more flavor and bitterness.

A mild wheat malt flavor is up front - tart and dry. Behind this is a citrus tanginess - more lemon fruity than funky. A touch of grassy hop bitterness comes through in the finish.

Not much of an aroma - meaning its faint - it smelled of grainy malt and sugars with a light floral scent hovering about.  Oily palate.  The flavor is sweet grainy malts, drying field grasses, soft fruits, and a very, very mild herbal bitterness.

Soft vanilla and old lemon in the fore with sweet grains and malt. Tongue tickling and herbal bitter  through the middle. The finish is malt, lemongrass and a hint of bannana-like German Hefe flavor.

This beer is not incredibly complex or unnecessarily complicated or augmented, but it is fantastically enjoyable.

Sweet and malty beer without nearly as much malt presence on the palate as there was in the nose, and thats just fine.  I think this is a nicely done beer for the style.

A very loud pop as the cork is released, freeing itself in the last moments without outside agency....an immediate musty smell upon opening, and a huge cumulous cloud of foam disgorges into the glass, gradually dissolving into a translucent bubbly body with thick, thick lacing....the nose at first seems skunky, to be honest, more like Heineken than La Bavaisienne, but on allowing it to breathe a bit some acerbic grassy qualities appear, and floral and honey sweetness smoothes things out....fortunately the body has no significant issues other than perhaps being slightly on the too-sweet end; overall though its rich and bready-malty with nice herbal, dry-hoppy character towards the finish, honey and orangepeel, a bit of buttery-caramel or toffee and a sprinkling of vanilla....if you can get past the harsh nose, its a fairly decent beer.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
