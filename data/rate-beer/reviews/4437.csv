4437,"2016-12-11",4.0,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle of unknown vintage (likely 2012 or 2013). 
Aroma is moderately fruity with bright cherry notes including cherry pie and juice. Light tropical fruit notes. Light tannins and cherry skin with light oak. Light leafy, herbal phenolic notes with hints of an earthiness. 
Pours a moderately dark, purple-red with a medium small, medium thick, pink head that recedes steadily to the edges where it lingers. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor is slightly sweet with a moderate acidity that is well rounded. Light oak notes with medium light herbal and earthy phenolics. Moderate cherry notes with lots of cherry pie and juice notes. Light tropical fruit and lemon. Light tannins and skin notes. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice oude kriek, but I have had better bottles. The cherry and oak notes are nice, but the earthy and herbal funk notes could be a bit stronger.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

4437,"2015-08-14",3.9,"750mL corked & caged Champagne bottle. Bottled Jan 2009 - although its been crossed out(?)
Stunning looking beer really - deep scarlet body, touch of hazy, holds a very tightly packed bright pink head.
Aroma is quite vinous, not overly pungent but complex - black cherry, almond, getting ripe mulchy Pinot Noir character in there too, faint toasty oak (newish barrel?), touch of vanilla there, acetic acid twang, subtle leesy cheesy note.
Light bodied, lively carbonation, racy acidity thins things out but isnt overbearing, seems a touch malic, not as aggressively acetic/vinegary as many.
Tart cherry on the body, not sour cherry, actually reasonably ripe cherry flavour, the acidity is coming from elsewhere. Vinous once again - light bodied Pinot-esque, could pass for a Rosé of some description, but theres that touch of oak vanillin & toast, and faint funky notes of aged hard cheese & barnyard. Drawn out finish, lingering herbal quality (pips? stalks?).
A rather elegant, sophisticated Lambic. Plenty of fruit in there, but theres plenty of the underlying beer to appreciate.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

Funky barnyard aromas unfold along lots of leather, and hints of sour yoghurt, wrapped up by a gently cherry fruitiness.

Wooden, bready malts with damp hops stand against a super-dry, acidic sourness. Cherries blend well into the sour aspect of the beer, providing a mellow sweetness, while adding more depth to the wooden malts as well. At the same time, the cherries dont seem to be too young and pungent fruity, but with a ripe fermented touch and lots of stone qualities to them. The uprising sourness during the middle part is defined by an immense dryness, illustrated by cherry fruitiness. This brew has a great balance, with a very well defined, intense sourness, accompanied by an earthy, complex cherry note.","GERMANY","aleigator"

4437,"2014-08-10",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2014 Tasted from a ten year old bottle I found in a forgotten corner of the cellar today, must have been one of the first batches.  Pours a beautiful deep ruby red colour glowing in the autumn sun, clear; head formation is limited due to its age (and style) but with gentle forcing, a loose, milky, pale beige head appears (not a trace of pink) with quite good retention.  Old lambic aroma with sour cherries abounding, apart from hints of sundried tomatoes, raspberry vinegar, unsweetened yoghurt, very old sherry or madera, musty cellar, dried lemon peel, earth, dust, damp cloth, passion fruit, raw red cabbage, sweat.  Taste immediately very estery and fruity, sour cherries drenched in red wine, mellowish lactic acid, red grapefruit, soft carbonation but still some champenoise tingling on the tongue, barnyard funkiness, old sherry, Brett leather effect becoming increasingly stronger in the finish, which is dried completely by the lambic and fruit acidity as well as woodiness (also from the cherry stones), therefore lasting very long, even a bit coarse, but very pleasant if you are into this style.  I tasted this fresh some years back and admittedly, the fresh, crisp cherry sourness has decreased a bit, but in this old bottle you get a more noble, rounded and elegant character.  Very interesting to taste at this age - as is always the case in the authentic lambics.  Had this right after a young Oud Beersel Oude Kriek and though style-wise they are basically the same thing, it is not hard to come to the conclusion that beers of this level of complexity have a necessarily very different character.  Ill never get tired of this most complex of all beer styles.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Vintage 2005

A: Dark red hue with a subtle haziness. The color is really beautiful. The beer has a rather small head that quickly fades, leaving a few touches of lacing behind.

S: Huge cherry scents with sour funk. The aroma is distinctly Belgian and wonderful.

T: Surprisingly tart, even though I was expecting it. Cherries are prominent throughout, along with a funky sourness that makes your mouth pucker and eyes squint in lambic delight.

M: The beer is very acetic, but not harsh. Its amazingly tart and enjoyable.

D: Id love to have this one again. I found it extremely pleasant, enjoyable, and intriguing. Its a great beer to savor and inhale the bouquet of sour cherries.

Small pretty vast and slow disappearing reddish pink head on top of a dark purple pink colored beer. Looks delicious, though if the head stayed on for a longer while this beer would have definately gotten a 5 for looks.
Smell cherries, fresh cherries, bit like candy but also with sour hints, some cinnamon and something like brown sugars.
Taste is acidic at first but turns more fuller and not only sour.
Lots of cherries, sour cherries, some hints of older hops (and malts), spices and some sticky sugars that are less present than the sourness.
Light dry warm fruity (cherry) spicy aftertaste. (with the first couple of gulps, the aftertaste seems to disappear quicker than when warming up in the glass).
Low carbo, acidic sour light dry mouthfeel, full body and creamy texture.

Pours a dark ruby red, almost plum color with dark cherry/mahogany edges when held to a light source. There was a medium sized pop when I got the cork out but this beer poured completely still with no head to speak of.

Extremely FUNKY aroma with lots of earthy, stinky barnyard character. Lots of bugs and horseblanket with oak tannis and a boat load of sweet cherry. Im surprised how well the cherry has held up in the nose. Kind of smells like 3F Schaerbeekse Kriek but much more musty and funky. Hints of cheese, feat and bandaid but in a good way.

Extremely sour and mouth puckering with a lot of earthy, musty funk and oaky tannis which is countered by a sweet tart cherry presence. Wow, this beer has become crazy funky and sour with a lingering puckering, vinegary finish that leaves me drooling for more. Although this beer is very acidic and not easy to drink, the aftertaste is incredible and I want another sip immediately. As in the aroma, the cherry fruit flavor has held up incredibly well. I know that this beer uses real cherres but the flavor is so prominent it tastes like cherry juice is added. Lots of tart sweetness balancing out the musty funk and earthy oak. After the initial palate shock this beer becomes less intense and stomach burning but its still a sipper.

Nice red color with orange hues and a big pinkish head that fizzes away rather fast. 

The aroma really pops out of the glas as the beer releases a lot of carbonation quickly. The aroma is funky and slightly acidic with muted notes of cherries, bitter grass, vinegar and mud.

The flavor is acidic and surprisingly bitter with a mild complementary cherry sweetness. Even though the bitterness is very prominent, it is only relatively so. Its still sour flavors that star in this show. Muted notes of genuine cherries, lots of grass and hints of mud and vinegar. The aromas have a hard time getting through the strong acidic and bitter flavors. The finish gets a bit unbalanced as the bitterness doesnt really integrate with the sourness.

4437,"2009-12-25",4.3,"Thank you, Peter, for this exceptional sour.  This was a very well-aged version.  Clear, bright ruby red with a loose, light pink head.  Wonderful cherry aromas, both fresh and fermented, with excellent aged characteristics.  Full and multi-faceted with a lot of dimension.  The flavor is incredibly sour with a purity that is pure genius.  It captures the entire spectrum of cherry flavors--sweet, tart, bitter, fresh, aged, fermented, oxidized, tannic--and fuses it with a clear malt base that delivers the flavors skillfully.  This leads directly into a superbly balanced body that is very refreshing and vibrant.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"

Theres subtle funkiness riding behind to keep it interesting but not too interesting, and an oily slick, absolutely amazing mouthfeel that this may be one of the very few beers where I dont mind the non-existent carbonation.

Cinnamon aroma and a huge nostalgia rush smell of a well-kept dairy farm in the summer. Sharp, perfumed cherries, both the not-quite ripe green cherry smell, and the noble rot of cherries returning to the earth under the orchard canopy. Sour in a very rustic, feral way.

Satisfying perfumy plum and potpourri nose, with a musky, sweaty perfumed cherry scent.  Flavor: brash, rich, varying, exciting and wonderous.  Rich, slightly sweet, but very properly sour and tart.  Wonderful performance on the palate, lasting well beyond the end of the drink.  Side by side with Red Poppy and the De Cam is destroying it.


Jan 2006 bottle consumed in March 2009: little to no head formation but enough carbonation.  Nose is intensely pitty and tannic, nutty and woody.

4437,"2008-01-12",4.0,"375ml January 2006 Bottle Date; Sampled January 2008
Very minimal carbonation, though more than the Gueuze I just had, the head barely forms a few, extremely small groupings of bubbles after a careful pour.  When roused it forms a pinkish tinged tan colored thin layer of froth that quickly becomes a few lonely islands and a ring of foam.  The beer pours with hazy, cranberry red color that shows a pinkish hue to the red when held up to the light.  The aroma is quite tart as that is what I notice as I am inspecting the beer visually.  A deeper smell of the aroma yields an up front, sharp, tartness (predominantly lactic), followed by a fruity, bright cherry skin aroma.  Sour lemon notes intermingle with cherry aromatics, lightly funky barnyard notes and a touch of urea.  The more time one spends smelling the aroma the more a sour cherry note comes to the fore.  The aroma is not all that aggressively funky for a Lambic, though it does have a substantial acid quality to it.

The beer has a light fizziness to it, though it is not quite as low as a real ale.  Tart, yet somewhat clean up front; flavors of lemons, definite lactic and very dry, the cherry notes are certainly not omnipresent and in fact are almost more aromatic in character.  The beer finishes with a tannic structure and a slight astringency that is most likely from the cherries (pits & definite skin flavors), but also is likely contributed a bit by the barrels.  there is a certain flavor combination here that makes me think of cherry flavored childrens aspirin; it definitely has a certain medicinal / aspirin quality to it, especially up front.  Predominantly lactic in acid character, but it does have a touch of uriatic notes and hints of funky butyric acid.  While this is light and easy drinking, the tannins do add a certain fullness to the body that provide a nice texture.

A thoroughly enjoyable Kriek.  It could certainly have more carbonation, but I like the substantial, sourness as that is what I was looking forward too.  A touch more, well integrated funkiness would push this over that top.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

4437,"2007-07-11",4.3,"2005. Absolutely stunning cloudy body, the brightest red light burning inside the glass. As wonderful as all the other components of the experience with this beer were, the appearance is what is most memorable. It looks thick but not syrupy, like bloody valentine cake. A thin, creamy but fizzy pink head formed atop the body and receded quickly and fully. The aroma is of melted cheery and cherry ice cream, with grassy hops that are fresh and alive, leather too. Schaerbeekse cherries appear to be the main, if not the only, variety used. Tons of funk, barnyard, horseblanket, all of the requisite off-the-wall traditional lambic nuances. Acidity is evident in the nose, long before the first sip; it makes my nostrils sting and flare. No noticeable alcohol. The flavor, remarkably complex, is of cherries that are as fresh as can be, with mild bitterness and grassy notes, light to moderate acidity and heavy creamy sweetness. No medicinal qualities whatsoever, always a constant fear lodged in the back of my mind when preparing to indulge in a red fruit beer. Tartness is medium, pockets of intense sourness and tannins at regular intervals. Acidity grows with each sip and keeps a balance between sweetness and bitterness. A few sips into it and tartness takes over. The finish is very clean and super refreshing, cherry pie filling and hop bitterness lingering, just lightly sour. I really wasnt expecting as large of a grassy hop profile, but it works wonders here. The mouthfeel is where most of the tartness does its damage, clinging to the sides of the mouth. Full bodied, very sticky, very soft and effervescent. Incredibly drinkable, what fun this was.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

4437,"2006-09-10",4.9,"Please forgive me father for I have sinned. This is the absolute, the nasty, the beyond precognition depth of my demise, for I have forsaken you, amongst things, in imbibing in what is the clear path to hell. It is the elixir, it is sour as hell. But I repent... Forgive me, but I must imbibe again!. 
I know this one has nothing to do with religious sermon as does I, but holy, snapping dregs of beaten pillows (?) this was grandeur. I even needed the aid of a few Caol Ilas to recover the memories of my tasting this one.
Happy at a bottle of the best Gueuze money and spirited blenders could forfeit, I upon myself found this. An aged bottle not needed, at the t Brugs Beertje, Brugges, I had to have this fresh. Afore warned by one English speaking barman this was heavy, I retorted Yeah, umm, lovely, in a bottle, corked. I shall hold this til the naked hour, a glass I please!?! From that I, my wife include, ventured back to our haunted haunt and asked to be sole guests in its ghostly front room. The sun had reached its due and was receding behind the buildings of this old town. That was when the magic happened.
It erupted upon the cork freeing, a yeast burp that could knock an SS squad dead. After this release become layers of character, each nickling and tickling. Upper wafts of dead and dying funk, dank casks and cellar must - it is a Kriek, Im getting to that! - a very distinct odour of oxidised swarf in clean bins, straps of leather, fresh crimped and of course that fruit. This was tight, and by that I mean it creeped into the nostrils and tied my nose hairs together in an acidic challenge that bewildered me. The fruits attacked what was left. I loved it. Acidic, defined cherries absorbing whatever was left of the olfactories. Bugger it, there up for sale and this one bought them. What did it look like? If I cared it would be of some smoothy pureed at a health store . Nasty to look at, you cant lie. Ruby in colour, shades of pink roughage, no head unaided by the lack of carbonation. In the body held is so much fruit it is uncompromising and in the light opaque, this is Lambic Smoothie. The palate grips, tears and streams. It is light and yet easily sinks into overpowering. Tart beyond reconcile but so much in control. Wamm, bamm this is fruity. Upfront a heavy tickle, mid-palate holds tart and souring cherries like those you dare not touch and the apex reeks havoc. I loved it, it was all funk and junk, acid and sour cherries, goat hair and sweaty horse blanket, baby spew, soft cheese, exotic, malpicked, tart fruit. All can describe, all can lie. This was fantastic, bueno, lovely, complete. Became fruity as it ended phase young. Quite heavy, acidic as it delved into life after opening. I had my taste buds on high alert and still surrendered to this Beer upon beers. Absolutely lovely. Heaven and this!. The perfect Kriek, devilish is best!!!

Nose is tart and sour, you can smell the old musty, acidic cherry notes.  Light barnyard funk as well; wool clothes kept in the closet on a hot summer day.  Flavor is mint and vanilla with a short finish following a cherry mixed with lacto acidity at the start.  Flavorful, real sour cherries are tremendously flavorful.   Light grainy malt provides body, soft cheesey hops are evident.  Definitely old, funky and sour.  Mouthfeel is soft, with a low, easygoing natural carbonation.
