3756,"2017-05-26",3.9,"750ml bottle. Limited Edition 2015. The beer is a deep mahogany-ish brown. Small beige head, just some scattered bubbles after a minute or so. The aroma shows off a lot of that wine barrel. Big fruit vinous note. Moderate oak. Toasted bready malt underneath. Light banana bread with a dash of holiday spice. Some dates, prunes, raspberries, plums, apricots. The taste shows off a touch more of the base beers sweetness, but its still picking up a lot of the sweet and sour fruitiness of the barrel, particularly in the finish. Full mouthfeel, slick and smooth. Brown sugar, molasses and spice underneath. Interesting beer. Quite wine-forward to the point of drowning out more of the base beer than Id like, but its still a fun, tasty beer. Just not quite what I expected.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
3756,"2017-05-21",3.9,"750ml bottle. (2016 vintage) Pours a cloudy mahogany with lots of yeast sediment floating around and a thin, short lived, fully dissipating, beige head.

Sweet flavour of red wine, oak, toffee, chocolate, figs, balsamic vinegar, tart cherries, yeast, wheat malt and vanilla with a dry, acidic finish. Medium body with an oily texture and soft carbonation. Excellent, lots of complexity. A world class weizen bock.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","cmacklin"

Medium bodied with abundant carbonation that pleases the palate. Overall, a very nice brew that is much more complex than I can describe here.

3756,"2017-04-27",4.2,"750ml bottle with mini-card, bottle no. 0564 with expiry date 01.03.2014 (cellared for at least several years) via trade with Koelschtrinker. Thank you!
Looks: Clear Burgundy colour with a ring of stubborn dirt-like yeast sediments; Less than one-quarter finger head with soapy off-white foam which fades in 20 seconds; Fair sticky lacing and very slight carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragment malt, with strong red wine, Port wine, strong red grape skins, grape juice, strong cherries, alcohol, pears, wood barrel, sugar, light lemon and light grass. Lovely!

Taste: Mid to light sweet fair malt, with light pineapples, strong red wine, strong cherries, sour grapes, strong alcohol, strong liquorices, vanilla, wood barrel, molasses, light biscuits, yeast, lemon and medium bitter grassy hops. Red wine delight!

Body: Medium body. Very slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Fair maltyness in a solid and quite thick background. Any wheat and barley there were totally submerged into strong wine barrel, with loads of cherries, raw grapes and even some pineapple esters. Fine smooth red wine flows though with strong oak undertone. Fair sweetness, a bit dryish with sharp lemon to round. Excellent!

Booziness: with cellar aging, the 9.5% + abv is straight-up red winey and liquorish, which gets stronger with further sips but very comfy and not outlandish. Very good!

Hoppiness: Light lemon and light grass in nose, same in taste but stronger; Bitterness - mostly liquorices - fairly strong for a lasting, medium astringent cherry light malt finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Very winey and fairly bitter to mouth.

Comments: I suspect when this came out fresh a few years ago it may still be strong with the wheaty Bock elements. Thanks to aging, this is a fine amalgamation of wheat bock and wine barrels, totally integrated as a fine wine with nice fruityness and I keep asking for more. Perfect!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"
3756,"2017-04-27",1.0,"Breuvage très intéressant que cette Weizen Bock élevée en fût ! Connaissant parfaitement lAventinus classique, jai bien hâte découvrir ce produit. Versée brune transparente avec de beaux reflets de topaze sombre et mousse microscopique. Le nez est clairement celui dune bière élevée en fût avec cette note acétique caractéristique quon retrouve sur une Sour Beer ou un Lambic. On perçoit aussi des notes de raisin très persistantes, de cerise griotte, de fraise, de groseille, de cassis... La bouche est une violente décharge électrique : je nai jamais bu une bière aussi acide. La texture est plutôt ronde, rien à redire, lalcool totalement indécelable malgré un honorable 9.5%, la carbonatation est correcte, mais que dire de cette aigreur ? On retrouve le raisin, le côté pomme verte propre au cidre, la cerise griotte amer, mais larrière bouche est métallique et le côté boisé trop intense. Je suis navré de le dire, et visiblement cette bière a des fans, mais jai limpression de boire un mauvais vin pétillant coupé au vinaigre. Jaime beaucoup les bières dans le genre (Rodenbach Grand Cru, Queue de Charrue vieille Brune, Bourgogne des Flandes etc.) mais là, je le dis haut et fort : cest clairement dégueulasse. Alors soit ma bouteille a un sérieux problème (date limite fixée à Mai 2019, il y a de la marge !), avec pourtant un beau dégazage à louverture, soit cest juste pas bon à la base. Jai du mal à comprendre lenthousiasme que peut déclencher un tel breuvage. Navré pour la vénérable brasserie Schneider, mais je resterais poli en disant que je naime pas du tout. Les 50cl qui me restent peuvent servir pour une sauce salade... Bouteille 75cl, Boissons du Monde, Saint-Egrève.","Grenoble, FRANCE","Zarrach76"

Vinous dark fruit aroma with a strong barrel presence over roasted dark malts. Earthy oak and vanilla notes along with a prominent red wine character. Lots of grape, tart cherry and other dark berries followed by chocolate malt, caramel and coffee bean. Faint acetic presence but it doesnt interfere with the other characteristics and is not solvent like. Smells like a red wine barrel filled with chocolate covered cherries. 

Medium bodied with tart sourness and a very strong vinous barrel character that dominates the flavor profile, lingering over the malt backbone into a dry acetic finish. Almost all barrel until the finish with toasted oak, vanilla and dominant vinous red wine flavor with dark grape, tart cherry, currant and other dark berries. Underneath, there is some faint roasted malt but its overpowered by the barrel and acetic acid. As it warms the acetic character stands out a but more with strong vinegar in the finish. Still, its not solvent like and it blends well with the tartness and vinous barrel notes. Flavorful but kind of one dimensional with all elements of the base beer completely obliterated.

Listed as Aventinus Cuvee Barrique - weizenbock blended with eisbock and aged in Chardonnay barrels for 8 months.There were a lot of things to like about these sours/barrel-aged beers at OEC fest, comprised mostly of Italian and Belgian beer with a smattering of German ones. Unfortunately, a lot to dislike. Or perhaps Ive just grown out of really caring for a lot of particular barrel-aged beers. Like Spike and Jeromes, Dama a bruna, cuvee freddy, morpheus undressed and Abbaye de St. Bon Chien 2013, this was just another undercarbonated, oxidized, soggy, dull, grapey-fruity old barleywine-esque beer. Most of these or maybe all, were not over-barreled, which is admirable, but theyre just heavy, watery and provide so little in the way of brightness or levity on the palate. Sure, you may say, theyre more akin to drinking a good wine or port"" but Im not trying to drink that, Im trying to drink a beer. Even the best imperial stouts, which arent exactly brimming with levity, still provide a good body, carbonation and balance/dryness. Really over these types of beers...","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3756,"2015-08-13",3.9,"Bottle named Tap X Mein Aventinus Barrique (2014). A reddish brown beer, a head is small and beige. Aroma has berries and red currants, cherries, sourness, some earthyness, lether and dry barrel. Taste has cherries and berries, medium sourness, some wine vinegar, hint of fruitness of prunes. Medium bodied, not sticky, sparkling carbonation. This has nothing to do with weizenbock, more like as Sour/Flemish Red. Very confusing how mix of Aventinus and Aventinus Eisbock has been produced with aging this kind of beer which has no nuancees from original beers.

Medium sized lively and quickly lowering levels creamy vanilla colored foamy head on top of a hazy brown colored beer.
Aromas of Brett, wood, grapes, white wine, some berries, some sweet malts, tarty tones, cherries, some oak, some cellar, some brown sugars. A mix of Belgian Oud Bruin, some Lambic ish tones and a wild beer... Nice but Weizendoppelbock?
Flavour is tart and sour with berries, grapes, wild yeast, lacto tones, white vinous notes, some wood and oak, malty, some caramel, hints of brown sugars and a slight sprinkle of red/brown fruit with a light bitter edge.
Aftertaste is tart with grapes, some malts, white wine notes, some bitters and wood.
Low carbo, creamy tart mouthfeel, more than just medium bodied and a sticky tart creamy texture.
For a Weizendoppelbock this is quite weird and actially sucks a bit, but for a wild beer and beer that has been aged in white wine barrels ita quite nice.

---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhoneEarlier Rating: 11/26/2013 Total Score: 3.9Had much higher hopes for this as I love its 2 component beers. Upon opening at a good temperature with a nice ""pop"", there was an appealing aroma of caramel, vanilla, and balsamic vinegar. Poured with a small, thick, creamy, tan head that soon vanished and no lace. Color is a very hazy brown. Sticking my schnoz in the glass yielded besides the above, leather, fruit, and spice. Flavors similar to nose with tart up front, then bittersweet. Body is good, but carbonation is low. Finish is like flavor, average length, has alcohol warmth. I like the base beers much better.
Update- different small squat model with very dark amber glass. Here is a failure still and sour all the best parts are gone and whats left is not very palatable.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"

3756,"2013-12-03",3.7,"75cl bottle with the name ""Mein Aventinus Barique"". heavily hazy dark orange/brown with ivory head that seams more like a cream then a foam.
NOSE : dominating apple and tart aromas. Banana background. Strong wood aromas with a bit smoke. Dough and some funky burnyard smell. Nuts.
SIP : quite thick body with creamy texture. Moderate carbonation. The beer is a combination between sweet and sour. The start is sweet dough like. Apple like sourness reminds a bit that of a lambic with a little adition of strawberries. Especially that dry character of this beer has notes of wood as well. The finish reveals more complex fruit and dry notes. It also has some booze and nail polish delicate background. After couple of sips it warms me up. Aftertaste is dry like apple seed with a moderate sweet malt to balance it. I get also overall sour cooked fruit like flavor that lasts a while.
OVERALL : surprised. I was expecting more malty beer but this one is one hell of a sour one. Big body and sour notes is the best combination for any sour for me so I kinda like it. Careful about the alcohol because it is well hidden.","Warszawa, POLAND","Swaroga"

See here for proof of this awesome German title for beer lovers: http://www.biertraum.de/tapx-mein-aventinus-barriq is called ""Pate"" in German, hence ""Bier Pate""). Nonetheless, this beer is able to offer something you really cant refuse- so make sure you share it or youll end up pretty tipsy...and yes, Im speaking from experience here. So on to the taste: its almost as if a Belgian Quadrupel produced a love baby with a really flavorful Geuze, and the baby inherited the best of both their traits. A complex beer that changes its profile as you work your way through it, which is when you truly start to appreciate its complexity and smooth finish. Sadly, its another one of their ""limited edition"" beers, so once its gone, it really is Auf Wiedersehen for good.

ersma: danke an esther von bierland-hamburg.de für die flasche. das bier wurde acht monate in pinot-noir-fässern ausgebaut.
tief dunkelbraun. die verschäumung ist ansehnlich.
der geruch ist röstmalzig, süßlich mit hefe, malzigen tönen, karamell und gebrannten nüssen.
der antrunk ist röstig, säuerlich. dazu hefe, eine leichte herbe und karamell. die mitte wird süßer, gleichzeitig aber auch erdiger. mehr karamell. hier kommen auch die tannine hinzu, die die barrique-reife erzeugt hat. der abgang ist röstiger mit süßlichem hintergrund. die tannine treten deutlicher hervor. dazu gibts einen langen, malzigen nachhall.
die flasche ist ein traum, trotz der malereien vom  dreierschorsch.
fazit: lecker. die fassaromen (tannine, rotweinsüße) hätte ich ausgeprägter erwartet. auf jeden fall was zum einkellern. das mhd von 2014 dürfte makulatur sein, 10 jahre hält das sicher. die spannende frage bleibt aber: wie kommt das stückchen moos in meine flasche???

Ir pours like a standard Aventinus, but with slightly less of a head. Poured into an Aventinus half-liter. It has nice reddish brown appearance with a fizzy off whit head that leaves some splotches of lacing.


2013 bott;le:
Its a sour, and a fucking great one, no way you can compare the 2 beers.
I think the smell is actually better than the original. Rich dark fruits, banana, clove, apple skin, and caramel are all there. But the extra vanilla oak and pinot noir are just fantastic. The barrel aging adds a berry-like fruitiness that is a treat to sniff.

The flavor is intense, and far more interesting than I expected. Rich wine and barrel notes definitely make their mark here. It is smooth an velvety, ore so than the original. Flavors of berries and caramel dominate. The finish is herbal and wheaty with some clove and banana notes.

A stunner for sure, on par with the illustrious original.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
