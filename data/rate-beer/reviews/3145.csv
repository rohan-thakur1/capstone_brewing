3145,"2017-04-29",4.1,"Bottle at the radikal whale slaying. Thnx to FX. Pours dark orange , no foam. Smell is full, fruity, mild sourness. Taste is very intense, sour ( mostly lactic) rich fruityness. Juicy peaches. Dont get the white wine as a specific, but it does help the fruits to rise up in the taste. I like it.","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"

Aroma has a great tart peach note with a bit of tart and sweet apricot, light acid and a bit of a funkiness. Flavor has a really nice tart peach note with a bit of acid, a touch of tart apricot and a wine dryness in the finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
3145,"2015-04-04",4.3,"Bottle shared by Brandon, thanks man!! Pour is cloudy gold with a small white head. Aroma is peach jolly rancher with light fresh fruit and light funk. Soo nice. Flavor is Rich peach with light glue, a touch of Strawberry. Really really nice. One of the best smelling beers I have ever had.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"
3145,"2014-12-27",4.1,"500ml bottle acquired via trade on bA. Thanks, bro. The gem of our tasting tonight. Pours a deeper golden orange hue, decent haziness with nice sunny glow, frothy offwhite head dies to a nice firmer ring, decent lacing sticks around ok. A nice decent hazed glow. Aromas are rich and peach driven, mellow oak, cobwebs and firmer lactic and peach life. Big peach and nectarine nectar, citrus and a bit of white grape. Gentle bread, funk, and touches of yogurt. Initial is peachy and lively, sour and white peach meets lemon, citrus and oak. Touches of white wine, grape and yogurt meet a bit of bready malt, straw. Middle gets a bit funky, dry, tannic. Still, that big fruity apricot nectar, lemon and some acidity. Firmer yogurt, earth, bread. Backend is sour and lively, a bit bitter with rich peachy/apricot life. Fruity, lush and amorous. Some juiciness, oak and lactic life. A bit of acidity, yogurt, and citrus. Lively flavors, not acedic, instead focused and flavorful. Really nice stuff. Big fruit flavor, good firm sourness, nothing harsh. Lovely.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3145,"2014-12-19",4.4,"Bottle shared post-GABF. Not quite sure who brought this one. Really amazing apricot and peach aroma. Almost real enough to be fake. Tart with lots of lacto, oak, and a dry fruit. Finishes clean. Wonderful.","Lakewood, Colorado, USA","theothermatt"
3145,"2014-10-10",4.3,"Bottle. Less acidic than other Alpine sours that have come before. Apricots and peaches are front and center with a nice citrus peel tartness. Some vinous qualities along with some light oak. Long tart semi-dry finish.  Very well done.","California, USA","48FanInCali"
3145,"2014-09-07",4.7,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2014 Bottle shared by Jake. Pours cloudy gold white head. Nose/taste of apricot, peach, white wine, funky wild yeast. So fresh! Medium body.",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
3145,"2014-09-07",4.7,"Bottle thanks jake. Hazy fruit juicy pour. Super tart apricots and peaches aromas and flavors. Drinkable but nicely tart and sour.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
3145,"2014-03-16",2.9,"Another acetone-laced Alpine Sour. Sorry, but while the peach flavor in the front was a nice surprise, the finish left me displeased with the overall result. Not buying the hype.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
3145,"2014-03-15",4.5,"Bottle thanks to matt and Phil. Pours a cloudy orange yellow with small frothy white head. The aroma is strong citrus oil, peach, and apricot. Thin mouthfeel with apricot puree and light sourness. Wow really enjoyed this one. Very impressive stuff.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3145,"2014-02-27",3.7,"Hazy orange color with a peach skin smell. Taste was sweet and sour, loaded with stone fruit, yeast and tartness.","NYC, New York, USA","Godofthecellar"
3145,"2014-02-07",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 8, 2014 Pours a misty yellow hue with no head. Smells outrageously good: an apricot bomb supplemented with fresh peach juice. Jesus.  Bright, puckering sour fruit start to finish. Wine barrels cant hide. Plenty of flavor every step of the way, though its a bit one-dimensional. But damn, that dimension is amazing.  Damn. I dont want to finish drinking my pour because that means I cant smell it anymore. ISO.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"
3145,"2014-02-05",4.0,"Half bottle  part of a 5-bottle peach/apricot sour blind tasting. The beer has bright fruit aroma with a hint of canned peach nectar, fruit pits, almond, tree bark with huge acidity. Interesting earthiness to play with the sweet aroma. The beer pours a cloudy yellow with a very thin lace on the sides of the glass. Taste is initially sweet, with that peach flesh and apricot funk. There are notes of sourdough, lemon-lime, nectar and a very dominating sour cherry finish. The body is a little thin, but there is a nice lactic key lime / yogurt note right before the cherry takes over. The finish is very lasting and sour. I find the dominating cherry flavor out of character with the initial aroma and taste. Although there is a subtle note of citrus and peach in the beginning, the finish is a bit harsh. Overall a very complex sour peach/apricot/cherry hybrid with earth notes and some funk.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
3145,"2014-01-12",4.3,"Bottle @ a recent bottle share... Poured hazy, light golden/orange with a mild forming head. Aroma of peach juice and yeast spices. Tasted like biting into a fresh peach. Amazing fresh peach juice with sweetness and tartness. Refreshing and delicious. Perfect amount of sourness with a hint of barrel. Peach and apricots dominated this delicious beer.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
3145,"2014-01-03",4.4,"Bottle. Murky burnt orange pour with an off white head. Tantalizing sour peach aromas. Tart, but bursting with flavor. Big peach and apricot highlights with sour cherry and mandarin orange backbeats. Its sour, but not overly so. The acidity is very mild. Fantastic mouthfeel and body. Bravo!!!!","Florida, USA","50belair"
3145,"2013-12-31",4.5,"Bottle. Pours hazy yellow with minimal head. Amazing peach and apricot aromas. So good its almost fake. Taste is sour white peaches and apricots. Very tart and good balance. I cant believe how good this is.","San Diego, California, USA","tleaver33"
3145,"2013-11-24",4.2,"Very cloudy yellowish/orange pour. All peach and apricot flavors here, tons of peach skin and vinegar sourness. I really enjoyed this. I wonder how long it will drink well though.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
3145,"2013-11-22",3.9,"Bottle @ Pats tasting. Turbid golden pour with a white head. Smells like peach juice. Mild tartness, sweet peaches, and a bit of lemon juice. Simple, but good. Flavor is like fuzzy peach skin and sweet fruit. Mild citric acid, lemon juice, and a touch of straw. Drinks pretty good (for now, anyway).","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3145,"2013-11-11",4.0,"On tap at Alpine, pours a cloudy opaque yellow with a tiny head. Aroma brings out strong peaches - extremely potent and awesome. Flavour brings out loads of fuzzy peaches, pears, and alcohol. Extremely strong with the presence of stone fruit. Awesome stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
3145,"2013-11-10",3.5,"500ml bottle thanks to robert for sharing... Pours a golden hazy pale hue and topped with a thin film of soapy white head that dissipates quickly... Aroma of huge peach and apricot white wine essence with a puckering profile. Big fruit profile... Flavors have a big fruit fronted with peach and apricot but finishes off on a very assertive and abrasive acetone note which overpowers the fruit qualities.lighter than medium bodied with semi-lively carbonation....nice fruit profile and quickly goes down the wrong path.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
3145,"2013-10-22",4.5,"6oz pour on tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy glowing yellow with minimal white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is huge ripe white peach, apricot and a light sweetness. Taste is again, very fruit forward with a more apricot forward, slightly unripe peach with a ripe peach skin near the finish. The sour is light to moderate with a nice white wine thing going on to finish this out. My favorite Alpine sour to date.","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"
