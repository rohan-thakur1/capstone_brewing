4600,"2017-05-19",4.1,"The perfect Texas summer beer. Light and perfectly balanced between the wheat and orange/citrus taste. Definitely falls on the American side of a witbier, but dont confuse this with a session white IPA. The tenth one tastes as good as (or better) than the first. Kudos to Real Ale for recognizing that you just cant drink hipster hop bombs when its 95 degrees outside and brewing accordingly.","Texas, USA","brewperman"
4600,"2017-04-24",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2017 5/17.  raised from 3.1.....  got more sued to it as I finished the six pack;  not as refreshing of a beer as I normally get from the style;  there is flavor; so bumped for that - easy going down, just not what I wanted in a wit but will work on a summer day............................................... the wit I was hoping for. Musty aroma with some citrus. Hazy yellow pour. As others stated this is a combo of wit and IPA. Not bad just not what I was looking for",", Texas, USA","crajun"
4600,"2017-02-08",3.3,"Sampled from a 12oz can. A cloudy yellow colour with a thick white head. The main flavours are wheat and citrus. This beer has none of the delicacy of a Belgian witbier. Rather two-dimensional flavours with hints of coriander and orange peel, but lacking the lively yeast flavours of the original Belgian beers. Slightly more like a wheaty IPA - quite pleasant to drink but not great.","","Cimbasso"
4600,"2016-08-24",3.6,"Draft at taproom... Aroma of oranges, coriander, lemon peel, Candi sugar... Flavor is bubble gum, Candi sugar, light crisp malts, citrus... Enjoyable

4600,"2016-06-25",3.6,"Taps clear golden with a thick porcelain head. Aroma features a strong wheaty note and a citrus underpinning. Flavor ramps up the citrus but retains strong wheaty character, and presents a little fresh malt as well. Mouthfeel features OK fizz and body. Real enjoyable - especially in this bleedin heat!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
4600,"2016-03-26",2.9,"Draft from the source. Pale straw and hazy with a white head. Aroma is citric and fruity. Taste is lemon, wheat, and spice. Okay.","Texas, USA","wombat23"
4600,"2015-10-06",3.1,"Can: &nbsp Pale straw, a bit dirty, loads of sediment towards the bottom of the can, soapy white head, dies quickly leaving little to no head. &nbsp Nice spicy aroma, a bit citrusy, even floral. &nbsp Better than than Independence White Rabbit so far. &nbsp Not as bright on the tongue, and very spritzy. &nbsp Almost feels over carbonated. &nbsp Very bubbley on the tongue... BURP! &nbsp Soft spices on the finish. &nbsp Certainly nice aroma, a little bit more subdued on the tongue. &nbsp Very faint mineral like flashes after the finish. &nbsp Tiz OK.","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
4600,"2015-07-13",4.2,"""Wonderful aroma, lots of fresh and bright lemon grass, coriander,wheat, citrus zest, and some fruity yeasts. Hazy straw colored body that has a decent 1 finger cap, that leaves some spotty lace. Flavor is about the same as the aroma with the wheat stepping up a bit more, flavorful, not too bitter. Overall this is more of a white IPA than a wit, but its damn tasty. Bold yet drinkable, great for these warm summer days.","Texas, USA","BeerRenter76"

4600,"2015-04-15",1.9,"Hazy gold with nice head. Smells like a cleaning product my wife uses around the house. Taste is coriander, pine, citrus, and old bread. Normally I am a fan of Real Ale but this one is a bit of a let down.","Temple, Texas, USA","dlihcsnatas"

Cloudy pale golden, some chunks of suspended yeast, with medium fluffy dull white head. Aroma is nice spritzy herbal/icitrus hops, medium body, medium carbonation, and little lacing. Taste is citrus hops, orange, some herbal hops, and nice tart lemon finish.  I would say slightly more white beer than session IPA, all the flavors meld well for me.","Charleston Area, West Virginia, USA","weihenweizen"
4600,"2014-08-22",3.6,"Well this is an odd duck for sure... poured a cloudy yellow color with aromas of wheat, light smoke, some hops and a touch of citrus. Flavors are wheat up front, light ash and some stale hops. Interesting beer didnt know it was a session ipa until I got on this site to rate.","Florida, USA","burg326"

4600,"2014-07-31",3.2,"A hazy yellow pour with a frothy white head. Low to moderate head retention. An awesome floral hop aroma. The taste is a sour lemon with a yeasty pallet. Added a slice of orange to tame the sourness. A mild bite finish.

4600,"2014-07-25",3.5,"Can. Well, THATs an interesting color; cloudy hazy yellow with a slight green tint and definite sediment. The head is white, solid, and extremely lacy. Nose is very hoppy for a Belgian white -- rosemary, pine, and orange. Substantial on the tongue, with orange, coriander, and herbal (sage, rosemary, and marjoram) notes. Lots of body. Finish is long, citric, and sweet. Nice.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"

4600,"2014-06-28",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 29, 2015 Pours a pale yellow straw color: thin bright white head, dissipates to a thin sheet that leaves great lacing. Aroma is banana, dough, bready malts, mild citrus, mild pine. The Belgian yeast strain is evident on the palate, and follows the nose nicely. This was much better than I expected. It?s very refreshing with a light body. Makes for a great summer beer.","Texas, USA","gkeh"
4600,"2014-06-27",4.0,"Tap @ Hughies. Hazy pale yellow with a thin white head. Aroma includes the wheat and orange typical of a witbier plus piney hops. Taste is a similar blend, finishing with very light bitterness. And available in cans! Will definitely be foisting a few of these on unsuspecting pool guests this summer.","Houston, Texas, USA","dfinney23"
4600,"2014-06-26",3.6,"Bottle. The look is golden in color, slightly cloudy, and has a white decent head. The smell is yeast, florals, spiced, coriander, light hops, and fruits. The taste is mostly the same as the aromas and hops. Light, refreshing, tasty, and easy to drink.","Dallas, Texas, USA","travita"
4600,"2014-06-26",3.3,"UPDATED: JUL 2, 2014 Corrander, citrus, and nods to Belgian yeast meet the nose as the eyes take in a cloudy pale lemon hue with a non-persistent white head and no lacing. Wheat, bread, coriander, yeast and a smidgen of orange are present on the palate. There is a dry-ish finish with a twinge of citrus sourness left on the back edges of my tongue long after I swallow. Medium- light body and moderate carbonation. I can see many of these being consumed on a hot Texas afternoon. Well done, Real Ale. I believe you have a winner.

4600,"2014-06-20",4.0,"Pours a cloudy straw yellow golden color with white head. Raw wheat, coriander and spice, yeast, and some citrus on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes pretty clean and crisp for a witbier, with just a little hop pine at the very end.

4600,"2014-06-15",4.3,"Pours rich thick cloudy light yellow like hazed lemonade. Smell is fresh wheat, light spice and fruity clean hops. Taste is wheat, light hops, fruity belgian witbier yeast esters and light spice with light bitterness to balance the smooth wheat flavor and leaves it crisp and refreshing. Now this is incredibly drinkable and refreshing. Medium full body and crisp carbonation. As described as a hoppy witbier. Perfect for the summer. I love it.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"
