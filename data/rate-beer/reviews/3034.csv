Bitterzoete tonen van grapefruit, uitstekend gebalanceerd door meer moutige karamel en toffee tonen, aardse kruidige notities en donker fruit.

3034,"2016-04-08",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2016 Bottle of one and a half year old. American style barley wine with thick, moussy, quite stable, yellowish beige head and equally misty, deep amberish copper robe. Complex aroma of American cookies, biscuit, gingerbread, Cointreau, brown rhum, candied orange, mouldy grapefruit, lychee, caramel, chestnut, wet leather, pepper, hay, peach, strawberry, old cocoa powder and a bit of damp cellar in the end. Soft, sweetish fruity onset with estery hints of Cantaloupe, strawberry, passion fruit and lychee surrounded by a certain mushroom-like umaminess, soft carbo, vinous and fluffy, almost quad-like mouthfeel, bit powdery, built on a thick layer of caramelly and bready malt sweetness with softly bittering toasted edges, while the finish adds earthy, peppery, leafy hops with retronasal dried grapefruit peel fragrance but mildly so, as well as quite a lot of peppery, brandy-like alcohol, becoming a bit tiring and even slightly astringent on the tongue in the end, but providing a great deal of afterwarmth. Nice and complex, interesting, but somehow it lacks the dignity of the best barley wines of this world (think Sucaba and the like); still, I think with some years of cellaring, this has great flavor potential.

Pours a deep red almost crimson color with a reasonable sized head and some touches of lacing on the glass.

The aroma is pleasantly sweet and has lovely red apple and toffee notes as well as some light piney hop character, as it warms the bouquet opens up with chocolate, some light nuttiness, and a bit of orange peel. 

The flavor has a medium level of bitterness and is pretty sweet, not cloying, but certainly sweet. Its got flavors of chocolate, caramel, rich toasted malt, nuttiness, and a bit of citrus and earthy hop zing. Its really impossibly rich malt wise, but somehow all balanced out to being enormously pleasant.

Shared with commonshawn. Kind of a murky, coppery color with a half finger off white head. Aroma features burnt caramel and toffee and hints at the booziness of the beer you are about to consume.

Misc.: Reviewed after picking up Port Wine Barrel Wee Heavy

I had this a few times on tap (tasters) at AleSmith, but this would be my first time reviewing it. Wanted to have this so that I could eventually have Reforged, a blend of this, Wee Heavy and Speedway Stout. 

Poured an auburn, amber murky color with 2-to-3 fingers of khaki tan, rocky head when I got it. Good amount of spotty, foamy lacing on the sides of the glass. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.00)

Smelled sugary caramel, toffee, Citra, orange creamscicle, brown sugar, hints of butterscotch, dark fruits and peppery spices. Smooth for an American Barleywine and not too hoppy. (Smell - 4.00)

Taste follows the nose, but probably served a tad too cold. Toffee, caramel, light butterscotch, boozy hoppiness, honey, orange zest, Citra hops, oakiness, some spicy pepper, hints of dark fruits and some dry leather. (Taste - 3.75)

Medium body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, boozy finish. (Feel - 3.50)

This was pretty good for an American Barleywine. Id have it again. (Overall - 3.75)

3034,"2016-02-01",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 3, 2016 750mL bottle, poured into a Teku glass. The aroma is toffee, grape juice, and honey that turns to caramel and floral pine by mid bottle, and finally turns towards toast and honey.

The taste is highly sweet and bitter, more sweet of balanced upfront with a bitter leaning towards the end. The texture is thick, smooth syrup with a soft foam carbonation and full malty body. The flavor profile is malty caramel, floral resin, and dark fruit with a smooth finish characterized by clean floral and a pine resin flourish with mellow burnt sugar chalky and a slight leather mouthfeel.

3034,"2016-01-24",3.9,"750 mL bottle shared by ebone1988 for his 750th rating. What a nice break from the dumpsters. The pour is a nice light ruby colored red with a light khaki colored head that falls down to a bubbly head, leaving some pretty good lace. The aroma is pretty hoppy. There is a nice maltiness that's present, but I am a little surprised it's more bitter than sweet, especially after having had a couple of the barreled versions. The flavor is much more bitter than I want it to be. There is a lot of bitter hops and it's really lacking a sweet caramel malt. The mouth feel is excellent. There is a great viscosity and a creamy soft carbonation. The aftertaste is lingeringly bitter with a decent malt profile trying to poke through, but it's not working. A decent barleywine for sure, but it's too different than the BA ones for me.

3034,"2016-01-15",4.2,"A barley wine, mint olyan, ha jól van elkészítve, mondhatjuk, már eleve súlyos egy kategória Amit azonban az Alesmith hozott elő a stílusból, az valóban nem ismer könyörületet, mintha a szakkönyvek által meghatározott tipológiabeli sajátosságok egyszerre jelennének meg elemi erővel, ebben a sörben aztán minden benne van, amit az ember egy árpabortól elvár. Mély beütésű réz színe már önmagában masszivitást üvölt a levegőbe, miután pedig a kupak is lekerül az üvegről, egyszer csak elszabadul a pokol... Lehengerlő súlyú aromafergeteg tör elő, magán hordozva természetesen mindent, ami komlóhoz köthető, az angolszász vonalak szinte kidagadnak, amint a fűszeres, vadvirágos, aszalt zöldséges illatjegyek lüktetni kezdenek bennük. Az intenzív ízek netovábbja elevenedik meg aztán, kikezdhetetlen formátumú, utánozhatatlanul tartalmas kekszes malátafolyam, melynek minden cseppje mondanivalóval telt, élettel teli és vibráló, a vaskos vonalakkal meghúzott kép kontúrjait pedig tovább erősíti a komló erőtől duzzadó karaktere, tartalmas, kiegyensúlyozottan intenzív kesernyéje, mely által a szerkezet e két tengely mentén egyensúlyozva hirdeti magán a komló-és malátaközpontú műfajok minden erényét.

3034,"2016-01-01",3.8,"Bottled on 05/11/15.
This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a semi-hazy burnt amber color with a thin white slim little head. Lacing was filmy and glossy along the glass.
The smell started off with leafy tobacco aroma up front. Subtle citrus hops invade light toffee and caramel malts. Crisp yet sweet and dry fruity esters slyly move in.
The taste was moderately dry with a subtle sweet dry caramel to toffee. Subtle dried fruit rides underneath. Dry semi-sweet caramel to fruity to toffee aftertaste subtly moving into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about about a medium on the body with a good sipping quality about it. Carbonation rides in subtly and nicely, allows a super big stickiness, almost cloying, but not.
Overall, as an American Barleywine it works, theres some hops in the aroma that seem a bit further back but due to the age on the beer, Im not worried and didnt cut back. Its good for what it is and Id have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Pours a dark chestnut brown color with mahogany edges and a two finger, yellowish-beige head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Sporadic streaks of soapy lacing left behind. Surprisingly carbonated considering the style and high alcohol content. 

Sweet yet earthy aroma with a nice balance of sweet and leathery malt, dark fruit and alcohol. Hints of caramel, toffee, plum, raisin, booze and subtle earthy hops. Theres plenty of boozy sweetness in the nose but it doesnt overpower letting the toffee, dark fruit and sweeter malt notes stand out. 

Medium bodied with soft carbonation and a decent amount of boozy sweetness that lingers over the strong malt flavors and earthy hops into a warm finish. Dry, earthy hops up front are somewhat stale/faded but the flavor is still there, adding complexity to this intense beer. Earthy and leathery malt compliment the hops befoe being countered by toffee, fig, raisin and caramel sweetness. Theres plenty ofvalcohol sweetness and warmth in the finish but its not overly hot and the high ABV is relatively well masked. Well balanced and complex but definitely a sipper.

Very much worthwhile starting (slightly) over-chilled to appreciate the evolution throughout the drink (it is a sipper so this is easily possible). A lemon sherbet-like sweetness with the honeyed stone fruits (peaches, apricots) give way to a hoppy profile but a surprising lack of bitterness which is most welcome with some of the barley wines I have tried recently being more of a malty IIPA than a barley wine.

APPEARANCE- redish amber color, vigorously poured into a snifter yeilds 1 in of thick khaki head. good lacing stays as head dissipates

SMELL- balance of malty sweetness and bitter earthy hops. toffee scent dominates

TASTE- at first sip the hops have a bit more sway, but as the beer warms to proper temperature the sweetness prevails. as it hits the tongue you get a lot of toffee like sweetness and a bit of breadiness, when swollowing the hops hit slightly. ABV is masked well

MOUTHFEEL- thick and slightly oily, a tad bit more carbonation than expected still very slight

OVERALL- great american style barleywine, being that its a west coast beer you expect a good bit of hoppy bitterness but the malt flavor is great. Ive got one cellaring and cant wait to see how it tastes with a little bit of age","","connor0415"

3034,"2014-10-14",4.4,"""similar to Old Stock but hoppier...reallt toes the line between an english and an american barleywine. i like more of the american varieties, but this is is right there with OS as one of the best of the english. Hoppier aroma than others one this list. Very strong...i wasnt near the bottle when i got my first inviting whiff. flavor was big of carmely malt first, then hops...and lots of both. mouthfeel was full, even a touch syrupy. quite good. the only knock on this beer is that the alcohol was more evident than id like. I was expecting sheer greatness, seeing as how Speedway, Wee Heavy, IPA, and the Yulesmith are all at the top of their style...this one is close, but not quite there. Very good, though...and even at $10 + s/h per bottle, Im glad i got two more. Alesmith rocks!!! ~Has gotten better over the years.

OCZY : piwo jest przejrzyste o ślicznym kolorze z odcieniami brązu i czerwieni. Piana jest średniej wielkości i ma kolor kości słoniowej. 

NOS : zapach jest świetny ale tak intensywny, że aż zatyka. Bogate aromaty przypominają palony karmel, wiśnie, tarte, skórkę i miąższ pomarańcza, cynamon, stare porto, wanilia, winogrona Muskat, lody malaga... . 

USTA : piwo jest gęste o konsystencji tłustego mleka o wyczuwalnym i trwałym ale małym nasyceniu. 
Piwo jest słodkie i każdy jego łyk rozgrzewa alkoholem. Nuty słodowe przypominają palony karmel i nasączony alkoholem spod do tortu.

Beautiful colour about it - a deep, clear burnished copper with a small but persistent beige head.
Really intense, complex aroma; burnt toffee, sweet biscuit, toasted nuts, woody American hops, dried grassy spice, undertones of Oloroso sherry & Sauternes, rich dessert wine dried fruits of apricot and sultana.
Excellent weight, presents its own sense of balance between being cloying & acridly dry - perfect really. Low carbonation welcomed, very long on the palate.
Body opens out with plenty of caramelised, honey malt sweetness with nutty, biscuity, toasty undertones. However, not to be outplayed, hops come through with a vengeance, not alluded to on the nose; freshly hewed pine, cooked citrus, tropical fruits, unripe melon, and a good measure of lingering grassy bitterness. Warming finish without being overtly evident.

3034,"2014-04-30",4.0,"Look: Pours with huge, thick, creamy (bit of big bubbles), yellow (light mocha) head. Good, slow retention, some random sticky lacing left on the way down. Leaves a very thick, mountainy, creamy top layer. Clear, deep amber.


Smell: Oak the most dominant, bourbon. Malt driven center with molasses and caramel, medium intensity. Lightly hop driven freshness, mostly pine. Also very light alcohol notes, they get up when it warms up. Sugary and a bit salty. 


Taste: Medium-light honey, molasses start, that goes to medium sweet caramel, molasses middle and finishes with light pine bitterness with medium molasses, honey sweetness with a bit of oak. Oak and bourbon still stand strong. Lots of bitter honey sweetness stays on the lips. Nothing spikes out, everything in line - superb balance.


Mouthfeel: Full body, syrupy, bit of alcohol warming. 


Overall: Expected it to be a lot sluttier, but everything stays in good taste. Mostly amber malt and barrel driven, but the hop character is very welcome and lifts this one to a superb level.","SLOVENIA","tmzl"

Misty reddy brown with a light beige topping.

Dark fruits and caramel hit the nose initially, then more subtle notes arrive: light citrus hints and yeast esters mingle with the stronger said fruits and caramel malty molasses.

The taste is very similar to what your nose has told you: semi-sweet caramel, dark fruits with an underlying yeastiness with a citrus trace or two. Most enjoyable.

Possible some honey and raisins in there, as well as some toffee and biscuit. The taste is excellent. A slight sweetness, as well as a definite silky texture. Some caramel, raisin, toffee. There is a lot going on here. Actually a faint dryness to the finish. A wonderful offering.","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
3034,"2014-02-13",4.6,"Amazing barley wine. It smells like a perfect barley wine, sweet but challenging. The first sip shows its bitter character, dancing with the malty sweetness. It leaves your mouth tingling. It is slightly boozy, but for 11 percent, remarkably easy as well. This is balance. Tastes: red fruits, flowers, pepper, sweet malts.

Too much hops for me, not bad but not really my thing. Im not into hoppy barley wines, I dont get the concept, I do suppose they survive better that way.

3034,"2012-02-22",4.6,"Pour was  deep dark amber, with some sweet molasses malts, and citrusy hop aromas. The taste was complex- defined brown sugars, ripe cherries round out the sweetness while the resinous hops hit the tongue with a grapefruit hop-bomb. The sweet burning from the alcohol is evident but not distracting whatsoever. The finish is dry and despite the oily hop flavor, stays that way. Great hop flavors and the brew is light even though the flavors are so thick. Great Barley Wine.","Los Angeles, California, USA","hoppyho"

3034,"2011-11-11",4.6,"Barleywine beer isnt quite my favorite style of beer.  But a chilly November day is the perfect time for one.  One a side note, Ive been itching for some AleSmith beers lately.  So when I visited my local beer store to pick up a case of something different, I found a bottle of Old Numbskull.  The way the world works is sometimes a mystery, but it worked perfectly today!  AleSmiths Old Numbskull is an absoute work of art and genious!  The beer pours a semi-cloudy ruby red with a small, but patterned, cascading and beautifully laced, off-white head.  The aroma is perfect!  Its so inviting and eleqouent, with notes of floral hops, caramel, toasted malt, nuts, rye bread, candi sugar, bourbon, sweet alcohol and a touch of honey.  The body is so well-balanced!  This is a very dangerous beer!  It has the flavor and drinkablility that you could take one sip after another all evening.  But after just one 750ml bottle, youre gonna feel it!  The flavors are extremely delicious, well-balanced and so enjoyable!  The beer gets even better after warming a bit, too!  I taste caramel malt, floral and semi-spicy hops, earth, rye bread, a little bit of black pepper, honey, grass, bourbon, dark red grapes and yeast.  The finish is a little dry, but balanced and superb.  The aftertaste is one of the more engaging parts, as it keeps you coming back to the glass for sip after sip after sip.  I also get that warming feeling of alcohol and love.  Old Numbskull is an absoute beast; strong, wonderful, balanced and delicously awesome!","Pottstown, Pennsylvania, USA","obxdude10"

3034,"2011-09-29",4.4,"Appearance: deep brilliantly clear mahogany and cherry woods under a khaki tannish head. A slow stream of bubbles keeps the head intact while releasing a tantalizing nose. Swirls with a thin yet full layer of lace.

Nose: hoppy, dry, rustic, chocolate, plums. Plum and grape skins. Fall leaves, dry wood and sticks. Whole hop cones with an evergreen essence. Red apple skins. Luxurious and silky.

Palate: lovely marriage of chocolate and plums followed by sticks, twigs, and whole dried hop cones. Plums and grapes start sweet with their juicy innards and end with the thirst-inducing bitter tannic tang of their skins. Twigs and fall leaves mingle with an air of seasons. Black cherries and chocolate bark. Clean mouthfeel, medium-bodied, and silky. Rustic finish with pits and stems. Lovely.

Final Thoughts: AleSmith belongs in Floridaokay, I want AleSmith in Florida but thats kind of the same thing. The sunshine state aside, no matter where you are, if you stumble across some AleSmith beers, buy and/or drink as much as you can because they really are that good.

Taste is sweet licorice, deep malts, smooth cough syrup-like tones and hints of molasses and wood. Somewhat less complex than the aroma, but still very rich in flavor. However, the extreme drinkability is the strength of this brew. It is absolutely super-smooth and the high ABV is hidden like a Ninja, ready to pop out of the shadows and remind you of its strength only when its too late and youve had a bit more than you should. :-) This is an American BW in the same vein as the 3F/Mikkeller ""Goop""-series; somewhat fruity and smooth in its hop profile while retaining a high level of smoothness, reminiscent of the English-style BWs.

Au nez, pas mal de malt et caramel, fruits avec un nez de beurre. Fruits avec une fine couche damertume et de citron.

En bouche, le bière est fine avec peu deffervescence. Note de malt et caramel et pas mal de levure et un fini donnant des notes de café. Je note aussi un palais granuleux du malt. Des fruits; prune, figues sont aussi présents avec un palais qui reste assez sucré et doux donnant une impression de miel, tirant vers le sirop de caramel et collant aux lèvres. Un peu faible au fini, limite plate. Garde un aspect terreux soit du miel ou de la levure accompagné damertume et en cherchant bien, un peu de soja.

3034,"2011-01-23",4.1,"Rating #1200. 2006 Bottle courtesy of drewbeerme. Pours a deep mahogany with fine rising carbonation and a creamy, beige head that leaves behind cascading lace. The nose is of dark fruit, rum raisin bread, dates and citrus hops. Full-bodied and velvety with fine carbonation and a sweet/bitter and drying finish that surprises me how much of the hop character remains after four-plus years. Big, sweet, dark fruity malt fronts the flavor profile that also includes citric hops and a candy sugar-like sweetness that pushes this beer into a liquid candy/English barley wine territory. While the hops still provide some counterbalance to the malt sweetness, I would really like to sample a fresher batch of this beer to see how much more aggressive the hop profile is/was when younger. As Ive come to expect from AleSmith... this is a damned fine beer. Thanks for the hook-up, Andrew.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"
3034,"2011-01-18",4.5,"11% ABV 750ml bottle, courtesy of Daknole (thank you so much for this GEM!!), served in a tulip.  Pour was a beautiful mahogany, which revealed nothing more when held to the light, with three fingers of large bubbled beige head; this brew also had a very nice show of lacing, as well as better than average retention.  Nose is caramel, candied sugar, dates, figs, malt, barley, notes of apple, a just a touch of wood.  Taste mimics the nose almost verbatim.  This stuff is just fantastic!  It is adheres exactly to my tastes when it comes to a barely wine.  Many are hoppy, which is not my preference, and some are so syrupy (which I enjoy to an extent) that it is almost like a milkshake (Dogfish head Olde School).  This is that perfect balance between the two that is right after my own heart.  It could only be better if it was aged in a bourbon barrel.  I really hope I can track down one (bourbon) in the near future ... amazing brew!",", Pennsylvania, USA","ljay6880"
3034,"2011-01-18",3.4,"Poured into a snifter. Big thanks to hoppymcgee for this one. No sure what vintage this is.

3.5 A: Really dark amber color. Aggressive pour yielded slightly less than one finger of beige head. Average retention, but lots of lacing.

4.0 S: Lots of caramel sweetness and breadiness from the top. Plum fruitiness with a touch of orange citrus. Alcohol is pretty well hidden.

4.0 T: Like the nose caramel stands out, but the breadiness is at most slight. Theres some citrusy remnants of hops in the taste as well and the bitterness does well to balance out the malty sweetness. Not all that complex, but decent. The alcohol that was hidden in the nose comes out now in a big way.

3.5 M: Lighter heavy body, but sticky like a very heavy body. Carbonation is fine. Somewhat creamy. Finish gives a long lasting alcoholic bite and also a slight bitterness.

3.5 D: Not a bad brew, but the alcohol is a bit too apparent in the taste and it then becomes downright militant in the aftertaste. I wonder if aging this a few years to calm that down.

3034,"2010-10-05",4.4,"Finally cracked this one open for the birth of my son on Sept 29th. I had been cellaring this for over a year since I bought it around Aug of last year. Barley wines are not my fav style, not something I hate mind you, just not something I always want to have, usually a two or three times a year beer for me. This was a wonderful light brown to red color and the smell of flowery hops and almost brownie-like malts after poured into a snifter. First taste is almost imperial ipa with the flowery hop taste that is almost standard for alesmith, and the malts kick in on the middle to back of the tongue. The clean ethanol warmness of the abv is evident just after the sip goes down like a nice mild brandy, but it is also well hidden so that its not too overbearing.

A - Pours a reddish/copper color, a bit of off-white head, some decent lacing and a ultra-thin cap on top with some bubbles around the edge of the glass.

S - Perfectly balanced blend of sweet candies, malt, burnt sugars, and some dark fruit notes. 

T - Again, the age on this has done wonders. Candies, burnt sugars, malts, dark fruit, vanilla. Maybe a touch of alcohol, but its very well hidden and is perfectly balanced. Sweet finish.

M - Medium body, oily and sticky, rich, syrupy finish.

Aroma: Nose is somewhat sweet: grapefruit, caramel, toffee, citrus hops, and resiny hops

Appearance: Pours a dark reddish-caramel color with a fizzy beige head and drippy lace

Flavor: The flavor is wonderfully balanced with lots of rich grapefruit hops and toffee malts

Palate: The body if this one is medium-full, with a wonderful mouthfeel and a nice creamy feel

Overall Impression: 
Wow is this stuff good.  My notes from the draft sampling seem to be pretty on the nose, but I wanted to make sure I got my rating down as I was drinking it from this bottled sample.  Wow, this is good stuff.  I had the draft sampling at a 4.4, and Im going to bump this one up, one of my favorite beers I have ever had.  No doubt about it, AleSmith is a spectacular brewery.  


Location: On tap at the Brewery, 1/8/10 


Aroma: The nose is of lots of fruits, some caramel malts, lots of hops (grapefruit/orange)

Appearance: Pours a nice caramel brown color with a slight red hue and a frothy head

Flavor: Reminiscent of the nose, nice balance of sweetness and bitterness, really flavorful stuff

Palate: The body is medium-full, with a somewhat oily texture, and a creamy smoothness to it

Overall Impression: 
This beer was incredibly good.  I really liked it a lot.  Out of everything I got to try on my trip, I think this was my favorite, and that is some stiff competition.  Right on par with the Yulesmiths for my honors for top AleSmith beers.  I didnt even know it was an homage to the 3 Stooges, even better!

Caramel malts are definitely present and are hitting my nostrils quite hard. A subtle hop presence coming through. I feel as though I am sniffing some dark fruits, but it is subtle and mixes well with that sweet sugary malt aroma.  With some age, the hops would be obsolete. Not too many dimensions to the aroma, but it is quite pungent. Nice creamy palate. Hops are mixing well with the malts. There is an underlying hop presence throughout the whole thing. The hops are sitting on my taste buds, and wont go away. Sweet sugar and a nice malt syrup are hitting my tongue. Slightly boozy.

I cant remember where I picked it up, both long and short term memory getting fuzzy of late.  I do remember wanting to save it for a special occassion.  Life sucks... Special enough!

Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel with a shake of pepper on the tongue.  The flavor seems to intensify all that the nose reported, fruitier with a darker caramel, and adds a hoppy bitterness - resinous pine and crushed flowers - that digs into the tongue and back of the throat.  A cloud of alcohol fumes slowly rises from below to fire up the bitter finish.  Its got a good beat, and I can dance to it.

There was no head whatsoever. Only a few lonely bubbles rose to the surface. The smell was like candy and caramel. The taste was resinous with a citrus overtone. This was an outstanding barleywine. Im glad I have another bottle which I will probably drink in two years. This was the best Alesmith beer I have tasted.

04/21/08 - I think this is from some time in 06 based upon the green punted bottle, I have cellared for over a year. Time has mellowed this beer out and it now does seem like an English-style barleywine. There is absolutely zero head. The smell is grainy and alcohol as well as brandy/cognac. The mouthfeel is pretty darn smooth. There is a blast of bitter hops at the end. Im not sure that I like this more aged since it was so hoppy fresh but it does age nicely. Once it gets fully warm the candy flavors show up. This beer should be served almost at room temperature.

Citrus hops are substantial, but not overpowering, lending a nice, balancing bite to the underlying sweetness.  Alcohol is quite noticeable on the nose. Flavors are very similar, primarily toffee and dried dark fruit based, with countering citrus bitterness and an unexpected touch of tannic grape skins.

3034,"2009-07-04",3.7,"Bottle. 11% recent vintage. Pours dark orange/brown/red/amber. Almost opaque. A little chunkier than expected. Large tan head at first, slowly collapsing. Leaves a lot of filmy lacing. Aroma was very hoppy at first, almost DIPA-like, but then calmed me down with cinnamon, caramel, toffee, a little bit of household astringent, alcohol, cane sugar. Pleasant aroma ultimately. Flavor initially starts out smooth, then BOOM go the hops. Alcohol abruptly introduces itself at that point, and can be blunt, delivering a throat and esophagus burn after the 2nd sip. After that, its smooth again with a pleasant melange of dark fruits, peach, the hops come and go, and then finshes with a little tobacco tar. Flavor can also be a little chemical/astringent at times, but not so much to the point of displeasure. Mouthfeel is par for the style, couldve been a little more alive in my opinion, but not bad.

Drinks light for 11%, my body is the only thing telling me this is a strong beer.  Sweet toffee and caramel, dark fruits, piney hops in the finish.  Very mild alcohol burn.  One of my favorites.

Aroma consists of some brown sugars, plums, caramel, piney hops and a bit of alcohol.  That all melds nicely in the flavors.  Flavors start off with sweet caramel/toffee, then plums, and some hops in the finish which really rounds this off nicely.

Nose hits upon opening, forceful yet yielding fantastic range of BW notes, probably on the hop side of things: citrus, orange, caramel,  maple... read Rastacoeures description.

Excellent appearance on this one. Deep chestnut-brown color with a nicely formed light tan head and very good lacing.

Aroma, when fresh, is very hoppy with a citrus character. In both vintages, theres lots of sweet caramel malt to back it up though. Maybe some slight dark fruit notes.

Great flavor, very complex. Fresh, it can be a little buttery, but this fades over time. Caramel malt, toffee, and lots of west coast hops on the fresher version. The older version really mellows out and you get some brown sugar, vanilla, sherry, and more dark fruits than in the fresher one.

Fairly full-bodied with medium carbonation. A little sticky and syrupy on the palate.

This is a pretty classic example of the style overall that just does everything well. Very well-rounded and somewhat drinkable despite the ABV. Always a good one to go back to. I suggest aging it for a few years.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

A really nice caramel presence that really holds the beer together.  Some vanilla and fruit notes are also quite frequent.  Alcohol is pretty mellow, probably a bit due to the age.

It is sweet but not overly sweet - it is not doughy and chewy like the aroma.  I am noticing a bit of citrus hops on the finish now, but still not nearly as much character as in the aroma.  Though the flavor is a bit neutral and hard to explain, it is balanced and highly drinkable (for 11%).  The booze is hidden well.  Medium to full body on the palate with soft lush carbonation.  Overall: definitely a great brew, but a bit confusing as far as the flavor.

P.S. RB says this is 10% and I just noticed my bottle says 11%.  There is also some weird black striation pattern on the inner circle of the cap... I don;t know what this means, but it doesnt look intentional.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

Full bodied with a rich, somewhat chewy texture. Nice mouthfeel. Flavor of caramel, toffee candy, dark honey, and a very subtle smoke phenol countered by a very subdued hop bitterness (due to the room temp cellaring). The attenuation is nice, sweet without going over the top (like Avery). Warming finish without the booziness. Solid beer, but perhaps I sat on this a tad too long.

Pours a ruddy thick liquid with a short tan head. Decent amount of floaters coloured from whiteish to dark brown. Big old malted barley nose with lots of brown sugar, toast, hot alcohol, ripe fruit and citrus notes. Very sweet, some hops wander in but seem to do very little in rounding the beer (in varying degrees/vintages). The 1999 had melded in to one big flavour whereas the ’00 and 02 where still working on it. The youngest in the vertical was very sweet and probably had a little too early. Lots of  toffee, butterscotch, and peaty flavours throughout. Hops come out and finish with a good dose of booze. I had some of this at RBSG ’05 and it did benefit from the increased aging, although there was a little bit of oxidization. It’s a lovely big beer and to be honest it was hard to be in the mood for it mid-August.

I believe this was a fresh bottle when I purchased it.  Pour is a hazy orange and ruby with a very thin off white head that fell to bubbles quickly.  Aroma is very full and wonderful.  Immediately, get quite a bit of caramel sweet citrus and malt.  Very much an American Barley Wine nose.  Underneath, a bit of honey, some grainy, floral earthiness.  Faint whiff of alcohol behind all of that.  Taste mirrors the nose closely, starts bittersweet citrus, gives way to caramel maltiness and finishes with some additional honey sweetness.  The finish is earthy and dry, with a tiny touch of alcohol heat.   The honey sweetness in the finish is not quite cloying, but certainly is in that direction.  Palate is medium, suits the beer nicely.  Overall, a very satisfying Barley Wine.  I can imagine this one is pretty hoppy fresh.  Thanks for selling mail order, Joey!","Kansas, USA","theisti"

A bit of light citrusy hops chimed in as well.  Lots of sweet malt and dried fruits in the flavor.  The hops try and assert themselves but are overwhelmed by the malt and fruit.

Aftertaste was actually a little bitter with the hops sneaking in at the end.  Fairly heavy, syrupy mouthfeel with decent carbonation and the aforementioned piny hop aftertaste.

3034,"2008-01-28",3.5,"2006 (?) bottle: Silver foil and blue lettering, silver second-color in the printing. 

Pours a glowing red brown with a good-sized tan head. Dark caramel, some tropical fruit, cinnamon, just a mild touch of oxidation on the aroma. Also something less pleasant that I can best describe as a faint whiff of trout skin.  Overall the aroma isnt particularly powerful, for a 10% beer served in the vicinity of 60 degrees. 

Pretty strong malt drive right from the get-go, not candy-sweet but enough gentle sugars to avoid being dry or sour, fruits from the hops come through , some alcohol flavor, mild salt, chewy brown bread baked with molasses. Toasted grain, nuts. Ultimately, though, the flavors dont blast forward the way one would hope given the brewer and the ABV. Instead Im left with an aftertaste like drinking the melted icewater off an empty scotch on the rocks. Relatively little carbonation; the mouthfeel hides the 10% very well, soft with very little heat. Id have said this could be 8% at the very most. Mostly thats good; but its also thinner like an 8% ABV and I could some more heft to the palate. 

If this were a no-name barleywine Id be not exactly disappointed but also not overly excited. Instead, coming to this one after all the hype, Im a bit let down. Its fine, I guess, but no better and quite often worse than any number of more easily available options.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Pours a crystal clear copper brown with a big-bubble foam head initially medium sized, diminishing to a heavy dusting and a creeping border of foamy lace.  The piney hops on the smell are surprising and nice, mixed with a sweetly fruity cherry and a lightly syrupy sourdough malt.  Alcohol apparent in the smell.  Aggressive hops attack the back sides of the tongue with a very denatured bitterness; tar, blackberry, licorice, and a little bit of clove on the tongue in the finish, very interesting.  Not as malty as I expected, this is pretty light bodied for a barley wine.  The middle is dominated by a whiff of alcohol and piney prickling hops that make the finish somewhat acidic every few sips.  This is a sipper and seems like it was designed to be an accompaniment to foods; its not the type of beer that consumes your senses and focus.  Parts of it can get a little out of control: the alcohol can creep up and overshadow things every few sips, sometimes the hops seem out of balance, but I really like the rootsy flavors in the finish.

3034,"2007-11-14",4.0,"Didnt really stound out a lot for me as a BW, which is a bit of a surprise, and a disappointment in terms of $11 for a bomber.  I cant do much of a descriptive critique, because it sums up just about anything youd expect to get in a standard BW.  Maybe a bit more of a mellow, bready finish than usual.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"
3034,"2007-11-12",4.2,"750 ml bottle.  Pours a amber orange with a beige head that lasts through most of the sitting.  Aroma is quite abundant.  Caramelized, dough, grapefruit, oranges, touch of alcohol and a touch of cherries.  Flavor matches the nose with thick malts layered in grapefruit, oranges, caramels, dough, and a malt sweetness that is nice but not overdone with a touch of alcohol warmth.  Creamy balanced, delicious.  Wow I now have a huge desire to try this from a Bourbon barrel.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"
3034,"2007-11-11",4.2,"Thanks Holdenn for sharing this fine brew with me.  Bottle from unknown vintage, though probably 06 or 07.  Hazy orange with medium beige head.  Aroma is grapefruit and big malt aroma, caramel and alc are present but not too much a little dough rounds out this beer as well.  Flavor is very flavorful grapefruit/citrus hop bitterness with a nice malt sweetness to balance it out, dough also is very asseritive.  Medium to full body that is well carbonated, leads to creamy settle.  Overall  a very well balanced big beer.  Thanks Matt!!!!","Grand Rapids/Chicago, Michigan, USA","xnoxhatex"

3034,"2007-11-09",4.4,"(Bottle, thanks WeeHeavySD) Pours beautiful reddish brown amber with a small off white head. Great balance between the malt and the hops in the aroma with tones of caramel, creamy cookies, honey, fudge, citrus  mostly grapefruit and oranges, resin and bitter herbs. Fruity, exotic and juicy undertones of mangos, red currant, apricots, honey melon, bananas and maybe some strawberries. The nose is both peppery and creamy at the same time with a great deal of alcohol warmth. Hints of vanilla and almond paste. Very clean and well balanced flavour with caramelly and cookie-ish malt up front with a hoppy backdrop of resin, citrus and some apricot. A rather wide fruit spectra is present in the flavour as well. Full, round, creamy, soft and light chewy mouthfeel with a soft sparkling carbonation. Medium sweet and medium bitter, so  once again - very well balanced. Bitter hops, a soft stickiness and a minty alcohol sting lingering in the aftertaste. Medium dry finish. Medium full bodied. This is Ale Smith in a nutshell  great receipt, great brewed and a great outcome!","Göteborg, SWEDEN","Marsiblursi"

3034,"2007-11-02",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2009 2005 bottle.  Reddish color with a light head.  Sweet bready-sugar aroma with a nice hop smell that is a tad medicinal, but enticing.  Flavor is malty with some solid hop flavor that is very smooth - only a tad medicinal.  Mouthfeel is impeccable with some smooth maltiness and a mellow hop finish that rules big time.  As with Decadence 06, & Winter yule, the malts are too medicinal to be pleasant.  Im looking forward to boith the BA version and the remaining bottles with a bit more time on them.  Nice BW!","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"
3034,"2007-10-30",3.9,"Pours a reddish amber orange with a light beige ample head.  Hops and light malt in the nose. Initial taste is tart and tangy orange, followed by a syrup/fruity sweetness. Mild hoppiness is also very present.  All of this flavor disguises the alcohol and presents a very nice balance of many flavors and hops.  An excellent barley wine.","Ohio, USA","AgedOak"

Smells appetizing, really nice.  Taste is also very sweet, dark fruits and sugars, with citrus hops and a little bit of a smokey, peaty flavor that reminds me of good scotch.  I like barleywines where the hops are a little more present in the flavor, but its still really good.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","DeweyDell"
3034,"2007-10-28",4.6,"750ml.  Brown bottle, 2007, I think.  Pours a fiery, burgundy color with a thick, foamy off-white head.  A bunch of spiderwebbed lacing.  Very impressive looking.  Can smell this thing as I was pouring it in the glass.  Huge malt sweetness, bitter, piney hops.  Smooth, resinous, earthy with a tinge of citrus.  Candy.  Caramel.  Nice complexity and balance.  Taste is sweet, thick, syrupy though not cloying.  Bitter hops.  Nice full-bodied mouthfeel.  Wow, this beer is kind of amazing.

3034,"2007-10-24",4.2,"Ah the labor involved in procuring this fine beer was intense.  Brought this back from SD in checked baggage along with 11 other bottles that almost didnt make it onto the plane.  A little schmoozing of the gate agent though will get you what you need.  Enough of the anecdote though, this one was worth it.  I was pleasantly surprised by the slightly hoppy aroma.  Enjoyably smooth nutty aroma.  Slight alcoholic warmth at the very end but Ill get over it.  Cloudy amber/brown color.  Found this very smooth and balanced.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
3034,"2007-10-21",3.9,"750ml bottle, 2007 vintage, i believe. pours dense auburn with white head that lasts. nose has a big tobacco and plum presence. flavor is charred, dry red and dark fruits, some tobacco, brown sugar, almosty winey, a dry over ripe fruity finish. a bit watery mouth feel but the alcohol is well hidden. as it warms it becomes mostly cotton candy and brown sugary in the nose and flavor. a nice english style barleywine but it needs a few years age to gain the complexity one desires.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

3034,"2007-10-03",3.6,"So maybe I drank this one too young. Must have again to give a great opinion. Had a small taste before this and thought it was different and smoother. This bottle very strong and some bitterness. Not as sweet ans smooth as expected. Wonderful aroma still but packs a bite punch at the end. A little hot as far as the alcohol.","Kingston, New York, USA","yobdoog"
3034,"2007-09-26",4.0,"2006 vintage. This beer poured out a deep ruby red with a small tan head. Aroma that filled the air was heavy hops full of grapefruit and pine. Sweet notes of caramel are present as well. The taste is pretty good, again heavy on the hops deep resin of pine and citrus are present. However, in all this bitterness a sweetness of honey and caramel blend together and form quite nicely with the bitterness of the beer. Alcohol is hidden exceptionally and for such a strong brew I found this to be incredibly smooth. Another nice one from Alesmith, I have only found one beer they produce so far that I have disagreed with.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","rayg1"

Captivating aroma of sweet malts, caramel, vanilla, and candied dark fruits.  Taste supports the aroma nicely, with mild carmely sweetness followed by the slightest hoppy finish.  Palate is full and creamy, smooth and medium-full mouthfeel, with a slightly lingering and mellow finish.

3034,"2007-08-21",4.2,"2004, 750ml bottle.  Pours a translucent, copper/caramel colored amber with a zero head.  Smells of candy, medicine, malt and ethanol.  Flavor is caramel, candy, vanilla, whiskey, wood, citrus.  The finish is where this beer kicks it up, the heavy alcohol first hits the tongue and warms the mouth.  The bitterness from the hops then takes over, tingling the mouth and tongue.

The aroma was all fruity/candy sweetness and booze...I guess this has mellowed out some.  Upon tasting, I get all malt to start, with dark fruits being the predominant taste, though it was tough for me to pinpoint anything specifically. The finish was sweet and boozy, with the latter being predominant after swallowing.  The hops definitely faded in this one.  I wonder how this tastes fresh.  Still, a solid beer nonetheless and glad I got the chance to try it, though I recommend sharing it with a friend or several.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"
3034,"2007-06-30",4.3,"2004. This is one of those beers. A beer that I can sit back with, close my eyes, take a long draw from the glass and effortlessly float away, even if Im in a crowded room. Clouded mahogany body looks like liquified, split wood, with swirling copper hues and ruby glints that could light up a dark corner of a bar. A thick tan head is resistant to dispersion and eventually leaves behind thick drooping lace. Gorgeous and teeming with energy. The aroma blends notes of toffee and caramel into a rich melange of candy, sticking to the teeth long before the first sip. Scents of aged wet hops, honeycomb, heavily toasted malts, apricots, dates, oranges, rum, alcohol and leather. Outstanding. The flavor is almost as rewarding and substantially different too. Intense hop bitterness is still prevalent, sweetness levels are moderate to high. Caramel and woody, toasty grains dominate, followed closely by fruit, then hops. The finish is sweet, then rapidly drying, very long and elegant. Mouthfeel is full bodied, rich and silky, with ample carbonation. A delight to sip on, especially the palate. A tremendous dessert beer.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

3034,"2007-03-29",3.8,"2006 bottle, trade from Ogglethorp, thanks Brian!  Pours a hazy and rich mahogony color with off-white head that fades quickly.  Aroma is...whoa...thats one frickin agressive aroma and is actually a bit off-putting to me.  Aroma is an intense caramel, dark fruit, and alcohol, not too appealing for me.  However, as soon as it hits room temp its not as devastating to the ol nostrils.  Taste is a lot easier on the senses with a a nice surge of caramel, dark fruit, and again an abundance of alcohol.  With this beer being so right in your face it finishes pretty smooth while revealing some nice hopiness and some light cocoa and some slight cherry as well.  Didnt quite live up to the hype but Id drink it again if I was offered it.  Hopefully some aging would drown out the alcohol a bit more as Ive had higher abv beers with less alcohol presence then this.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Juelze"

Pours a slightly hazy dark orangish copper colored body under a small tight bubbled off-white head that ran to a thin ring.  The nose is heavy toffee and sweet caramel malt with lots of balancing hoppiness.  A little alcohol, but not much for a 10% beer.  Pretty well balanced flavor, for all that malt theres pretty minimal sweetness thankfully.  Nicely balanced with lots of bitterness on the finish.  Surprisingly well hidden alcohol.  Some notes of brown sugar.  Mouthfeel is thick and full bodied but never sticky or cloying.  Nice moderate slightly fizzy carbonation.  This is the finest crafted Barleywine Ive ever had.  My second highest rated, but my first is Midnight Sun M, which is really a whole different animal.  This was just so incredibly drinkable it went down faster than any other 10% beer Ive had.

Warming alcohol but by no means excessive, especially given the 10% ABV. Maybe a touch lighter in viscocity than I expected in a barley wine, but that is very minor.

3034,"2007-02-11",4.3,"2003 vintage. Pours a fairly thick and viscous consistency. Reveals a slightly hazy amber-burgundy color supporting a tight, dense bone-white head which gradually fades to a spotty film. No lacing noted. A rich, beautiful bouquet of hot melted caramel candy, fresh cookie dough and chocolate malt balls combined with a respectable hop contribution of grapefruit, tangerine and pine needle. For a west coast product you can surmise from the aroma profile this is not an overwheling ""hop-bomb"" as are many other Barley Wines from this area. Mouthfeel is just perfect for this style; thick, chewy, oily with a minimum amount of carbonation to keep it silky smooth. Flavor profile is admirably balanced between the malts and hops. Lots of Sugar Daddy caramel candy sweetness with some toasty malts all balanced nicely with a citrus/piney hop bitterness to even it all out. The 10% abv is not in the least obtrusive, barely making its presence known.

Ethanol is blatant upon the nose, while blends in the background a mixture of apple, pear, almond and cherry; further below unctuous malts remind of toasted caramel, nougat, brown sugar and honey. The complexity is not lacking but the alcohol is what I blame, and again on the palate it bludgeons the taste buds.

3034,"2006-10-08",3.6,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2007 Im reading over the commercial description here on the Old Numbskull, and AleSmiths little mini-litany defending the Numbskulls name is making a whole lot of sense.  It definitely thumps the skull with a fair bit of force and alcohol, thats for sure, but Im uncertain whether Im really into the whole business of knocking my senses around with muscle bound beers.  The real fault is my own inability to translate the salient features of Barley Wines into appreciable characteristics.  Even the notorious Old Numbskull, a namesake I can deeply relate to, is above (or below) my sensory radar, depending on whether Im feeling haughty or humble.  All the same, I was stoked to give another AleSmith a try, especially while AleSmith was 1-1 for my taste buds.  Again, thanks to my philistine palate Im unable to appreciate what so many find in the flippantly and friendly titled Old Numbskull.  It pours a lovely semi-translucent auburn color, with a wooly brick of foam sitting atop like a life raft in a choppy sea.  The smell gently curls out and away from the beer, intimating barbeque smoke, stale pears, an arcane cheesiness, grapefruit, soft peach notes and hops to the nose.  Naer have I smelled something quite as nice, or as interesting.  Nothing is exciting as a smell my nose can really ruminate over, and there the Old Numbskull brilliantly succeeds.  The denser dunce of the flavor tasters, my own tongue, failed to become the aesthete my nose is.  Instead it grappled with a stifling, cloying alcohol, itself accompanied with a spritzy malts.  A bit of warmth introduces slivers of licorice flavor to the beginning and a gentle taming of the ethanol, but nothing so radical as to change my opinion of the flavor.  The abundance of alcohol is nothing to admire, but the palate is something different.  Its well balanced and light, springy but smooth, almost like I could chew it.  Probably one of the finest mouthfeels of any beer Ive had; a drink entirely welcome to be supine on my tongue.  Still, I regret connecting with the Numbskull as a concept more than a beer, which, with great irony, may make me the greatest Numbskull of all.  A true testament to the frivolity the brewers extol so much in their beer christening.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

3034,"2006-09-29",3.9,"Starts off sticky sweet, with a whiskey vibe. Then the hops kick in to give it some kick and the malt rounds out the body. Feels smooth on the tongue, almost creamy. 10% ABV isnt too high for a barleywine, but this feels especially potent right now.

3034,"2006-08-29",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2008 As long as Ive been reading this site and drinking some fine beers, its finally time to review!  Lets start off on the good foot.

Bottle: The pour looks thick and cloudy before it even hits the glass.  Head is minimal, but the small amount of lacing holds through the entire glass.  Aroma show signs of that caramelly sweetness, but it seemed ever so slightly hot.  Very little hops detected.  Flavors ran the gamut here and I detected different things ever sip.  THere was prevelant caramelly sweetness, with occasionally dashes of saltiness upfront, and hints of cherries and/or grapefruit mid-sip.  The beer felt thick, but not real syrupy.  It took a ful 10 seconds for the hop bitterness to show up after swallowing, but they provided a dry bitterness that lingered forever.  Ironic that the aroma showed very little piney hop scents.  Great beer, best barley wine Ive had so far.


I hate to do this Old Numby, and my first ever beer review, but I gotta take the score down.  Just doesnt seem as good now.  The hops taste a little off, maybe a certain staleness to them, and the aroma has some vegetable element to it.  Never attractive, even when broccoli smells like itself.  Pleasant malt taste for sure, but I remember it not being so subdued; initially I liked the boldness.  Still good, but not 4.5 good.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"
3034,"2006-08-27",4.0,"Turbid coppery rust with lots of floaties, thin light tan head.  Musty nose of brown sugared covered apricots, soft candied pine, hints of peach, tangerine, and booze.  Very light chocolate notes emerge after further warming.  Rich fruity hop flavors up front include spruce, pine and touches of citrus.  Its very well balanced with a strong sweet toasty caramel malt backbone.  Medium to full bodied, light carbonation, bittersweet finish.  Good stuff, but the OA version is more my cup of tea...","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
3034,"2006-08-23",4.3,"Pours deep amber with a small to medium white head.  Aroma is pine hops, caramel malt, some honey.

LOTS of rich caramel malt - bready, toffee thickness.  Thich chewy mouthfeel with somewhat sharp carbonation.

My friends and I were enjoying some Indian food - a nice curry to be precise - and I think it threw off most of the experience.  We went and bought Snifter glasses so that was legit, but the food and the rice were not the fare we should have had in order to rate this beer properly.  I shall return.","USA","jhanauer"
3034,"2006-07-24",3.1,"Had a bottle at Dilly Deli in Mariemont, OH.  I have to say, I was a little disappointed with this barley wine.  It lacked the smoothness that I so enjoy as well as the sweet, malty complexity found in better barley wines.  I also found a harshness in the finish as if it were too young.  But most of all, I found it to be on the thin side.  It just doesnt hold up to many of the good ones out there, and especially for the price.","Kettering, Ohio, USA","Maddog"
3034,"2006-07-13",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 3, 2008 4th beer of my BW fest.  Split into 3 brandy glasses.  Thank you ClarkVV for the bottle.  Cellared for 5 months, fridged for about 45 minutes.  Poured with a thin head that quickly became lacing.  Color is orange-copper-reddish brown.  Some floaties, cannot see through the beer.  Strong hop aroma but  with that BW sweetness underneath.   Not so malty (surprisingly).   Hoppiness is spiky tropical fruit.  Taste however lacks anything too interesting.  Again a muted tropical fruit hop flavor with some bitterness.  As it warms I get a lot of sugary candy flavors.  I do not see how this would age well.  Its nice but nothing spectacular.  Re-rate: Blind @ Cornboys 2nd Annual BW tasting.

Bitter up front with a great caramel finish.  Mouthfeel is thick and tingly, and maybe a tad undercarbonated.  A great beer (my favorite barleywine) and super well balanced, despite all thats going on.

The pour was a dark brown color and it was cloudy. I could see sediment floating in the glass as I poured. The head was average sized. The flavor was very nice, it was sweet with plenty of hop and alcohol mixed in. It would have been nice not to get as much alcohol in the nose. The flavor was not as intense as I had expected, but was still very good. The flavors were sweet, much like the aroma, but also had a strong hop and alcohol finish. When comparing this only to other barley wines Ive had, this is without a doubt the best.""

Re-rate 1-29-08
Not as impressed as my initial rating above.  The aroma here is one of the big letdowns--very musty and stale cardboard scents dominate.  The flavor is down the middle for me at this point--nothing spectacular and nothing wrong really either.  The balance in this is nice, but the overall flavor is thin and uninteresting.  Rating changed to reflect the new score.","Ohio, USA","thebaldwizard"

Alcoholic aftertaste. After half of a glass, I start to notice a lemon-creme type flavor. Tasty.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"
3034,"2006-06-25",3.8,"bottle. Pours a rusty brown-red hue with no head, but some large bubbles at the top, though an overall tame level of carbonation. The aroma is thick of dense caramel, oak, mild alcohol, raisins, toasted sugar, figs. Its rather bready in the mouth with notes of burning leaves, burboun, nutmeg, black tea, and that dense caramel again. Its semi-heavy on the palate with a smooth, viscous mouthfeel. It burns a little as it warms. Theres nothing out of character for a barley wine. Rather, its a very tasteful, bold take on the style.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

The flavor is  straight forward, what you would expect from the nose it delivers. Plenty of sticky sweet caramel and bitter pine, some golden raisins, just a bit too much alcohol present. The mouthfeel is very soft with light carbonation and a warm, dry and bitter finish. Very solid offering from Alesmith. Now, if only this didnt come in a 750....","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"
3034,"2006-06-21",4.4,"Opened up a bottle tonight thinking I had put a speedway in the fridge a few weeks ago, but as I poured I realized my mistake.  What a great mistake though- I had put in the Old numbskull that TAR had sent me, and didnt bother reading  the label before I opened. haha  Oh well.  I have had this many times before, and am surprised I had not rated it, as it is such a classic and wonderful example of an american barleywine.  Pours a light to medium amber color, mostly clear but towards the later pours you get some chunky yeastiness.  Thin lasting head and some lace.  Aroma is thick with sweet caramel malts, sticky rum and fruity esters like raisin and apricots.  Smooth flavor of sticky sweet malts, nutty, toffee, caramel, and rum with very light alcohol presence.  Very smooth, and keeps the alcohol under control.

3034,"2006-06-15",4.5,"Wow, now this is what its all about. Ive found Alesmith brews - while obviously of an extremely high quality - to vary a bit more than I care for. But this barleywine is just exquisite. A lovely deep brown/amber color with a fine, rich head and plenty of lace. The aroma evelops you slowly, with rich malts giving way to dried fruits, some tart and some sweet, with just a hint of smoke or caramel in there. I think I may have cracked this one a tad too early (couldnt wait!) since the hops are probably not as integrated as they might be. But this really rules.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

The aroma and flavor consisted of caramel, bread, tea bags, brown sugar, some oranges and molasses. Clear hop presence, keeps this from being a pure malt runaway barleywine, although clearly short of the American Barleywine levels. Neither of these bottles were hot, alcohol well-tamed. Original rating: Poured a reddish brown / orange color with very little head and minimal lacing. The aroma was sweet, hoppy, and of alcohol. The flavor was sharply dominated by the alcohol with a sweet and somewhat fruity touch to a pretty standard malty caramel type barleywine base with a hoppy and resiny aftertaste (molasses seems to be a common theme noted by others, which I might buy if I had it again). Mouthfeel was pretty heavy. Another year or so in the bottle may have improved this one.","","User37895"

Taste is also dominated by sweet malt but I cant find any complexity of dry fruits characteristics that I usually enjoy. Some hops provide a slightly bitter finish but nothing to overshadow the rest of the beer. Body is defiantly too thin and watery for my liking and alcohol is well hidden.

Candy caramel, dates, figs, chocolate, hops, dough, earth and spices you name it ...mmm good But once you try it the resin, alcohol and eter overwhelm everything its bitter and full of alchol, there is some fizzyness but for me the wonderfull tastes and aromas were all thrown to the garbage and replaced by a bitter alcholic bad wine taste.

2005 Bottle.  Cloudy, amber body with a thin-but-persistent ring of lace.  The aroma is rich and complex, with toffee, caramel, crystallized malts, a roastiness backdrop, vibrant notes of dark fruit, lots of fruity esters, and some honey on the tail end.  The mouth is full with almost no carbonation, yet it does not come across as wet, syrupy, or unpleasant, but as lightly dry.  Flavor is dominated by fruits: a rich plumb flavor, light prune, a touch of berries; lightly roasty, carrying into a mildly bitter finish of dried,dark fruits, grapefruit rind and caramel.  The alcohol is extremely well hidden and by now above 10%, being present in lovely esters, caramel, and a bit of hard alcohol (like a rum) long after the beer has left the mouth.  Very unique brew, bearing consistency only with its heritage (its creators).  It ages beautifully, and it is a wonderful treat to have an Alesmith ale once again.  I will return to San Diego sometime soon...I hope.    Let it warm, let it sit, then enjoy it.  The esters come to life; the aroma becomes wondrous, and the beer is simply lovely.","Reno, Nevada, USA","0o9i"

Cakelike malts, drenched in brandy are here again, seriously checking the USA hops onslaught. Some laurel, cinnamon and other spices. Terribly perfumey. Very liqueurish MF, fiery MF but not aggressive. Good one, ""Big"" in any sense, but making up for a pleasantly sipping beer.

Has a bold duration and a good strong finish.  A nice amount of bitterness.  I  would call it medium bodied.  A very smooth drink with a touch of dryness.  Very complex, it keeps my mind jumping and changing.  This is one you just have to try for yourself and make your own judgement.

3034,"2006-04-10",3.9,"Pours a sticky deep ruby/vermillion with a light sediment-haze. A thin head is quickly a cream-colored halo. Aroma finds funky yeasts, wood & wine, powdered grape drink and golden raisin. Syrupy mouthfeel precedes a thin, astringent finish while the flavor is that of a fruity white wine with honey sweetness amidst the vinous flavor.
Note: I was hoping to share this bottle with my wife, but she took a pass after a small sample, leaving the rest of the 750 for me. I must say that this beer lives up to its name when sampled in such a quantity (and situations like this are part of the reason why its taking me so long to hit 1,000 ratings... sorry Gene).

3034,"2006-04-06",4.3,"Another hit!  A very drinkable barley wine that smells divine.  Its one of the smoothest barley wines Ive had.  Its not quite as nice as the one I brewed myself but Im a little prejudiced.  Thanks Ale Smiths!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MrRain"
3034,"2006-04-04",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2006 From Bottle.  Deep reddish amber colored pour with only a thin ring of tan film around the edges of my glass.  Lightly swirling the brew in my snifter glass sends a shimmering effervescent parade of bubbles down the sides of my glass.  Sweet aromas of candied cherries and apple cider wafts to my nostrils, followed by blueberry pie made fresh with a hot, sugary pastry dough.  Sticky honey and brandied dates.  Rich, velvety mouthfeel with a strong single malt scotch dimension.  The flavor is impressively complex and comes through in four distinct stages: first, the sugary fruits from the bouquet splash across the tongue; second, a light maltiness with the alcoholic kick of a single malt scotch whiskey; third, a bitter pine sting of untamed cascade hops; and finally, a pleasant smack of dried prunes simmered with nutmeg spice.  Overall, an interesting, complex brew, but it could use a stronger fruit dimension on the palate to balance out the bold presence of the alcohol and hops.  I think I will try aging one for a couple of years and then re-taste.  Or better yet, I should try the barrel aged version.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
3034,"2006-04-03",4.7,"Had a bottle of this last night after Three Floyds Dark Sun.  As you can probably imagine,
I was feeling no pain after that one - two combination.  Very nice nose of spice and
flowers.  Burnt hops notes accompany hints of alcohol and grain.  The brew is a clear
copper.  The large off white head is pretty serious.   It is so nice in fact that my girlfriend
grabbed my cell phone to take a picture when the head was lifting up over the rim of the
pint glass.  I LOVE it when a head does that.  Wicked retention, and fair lace.  The warm
flavor cleverly hides the abv. with the hops.  The acidity is low but enough to give the
brew some bite.  Im always amazed by the balance and complexity of a well crafted
barleywine.  The big and thick body is both soft and dry.  Splendid, just splendid.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"
3034,"2006-03-27",4.1,"Deep copper color with a minimal head. Loads of malty aromas and earthy tones. Flavor is full of toffee and caramel, sweet yet finishes clean and dry.

3034,"2006-03-23",4.0,"The aroma has a fruity dominance with undertones of caramel and toasted malt.  The color is a deep amberish brown and is murky.

3034,"2006-03-23",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2006 Luxuriously rich velveltely chocolate aroma with creamy nut (wow that sounds bad), coconut, and slight hop aromas. Wonderful to the nose. Slightly dead pour is deep birch-amber. Strong, thick, with wonderful legs. The velvety chocolate carries to the palate with peach, fig, molasses, and sour apple.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
3034,"2006-03-18",4.4,"Bottle.  Shared a small amount with a friend who liked it as well, but doesnt normally care for hoppy beers.  He thought it was good, albeit a little too hoppy for him.  I thought the hop content was just about right.  Dark Fruit, caramel, honey, vanilla present in the aroma.  Sweet with nice bittering to offset the sweetness as well.  Very good and warming.  Maybe a little subdued compared to the best, but just a notch below.  The speedway stout is perfect, this one is almost there.  Thanks El Gaucho for another great brew!","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
3034,"2006-03-13",4.2,"This was an incredibly delicious barleywine.  The aroma is big and sweet, full off caramel, toffee, lots of different fruits, peaches, piney hops and dates and figs.  A truly well balanced nose and flavor profile, as I can pick out everything in the nose that is offered on the palate.  Has a very warming effect from the alcohol, hoppy but not overly ridiculous, nicely balanced.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","harlequinn"
3034,"2006-03-11",4.2,")  This beer offers a sweet aroma infused with malt, hops, toffee, caramel, roasted wheat, and fruit.  It is cloudy copper with a decent sized off-white head and a great amount of lacing.  This thick rich beer has a mild acidic characteristic that slightly dries the mouth. It is sweet, yet mildly bitter taste.  The flavor is of hops, caramel, fruit, and little bit of resin.  The aftertaste is slightly bitter fruit, caramel, nut taste.","Champaign, Illinois, USA","RooftopRogue"
3034,"2006-03-05",4.1,"Big malty and piney nose, reminiscent of a Bigfoot; deep caramel maltiness with some toasty bread notes; woody, nutty and quite hoppy without being sharp; rounded palate and somewhat chewy; outstanding.","Boise, Idaho, USA","ontario102"

3034,"2006-02-28",3.6,"London Gathering Nov 05: Hazy amber in colour. Heavy caramel aroma and flavour. Sickly sweet unbalanced, unfortunate as the barrel aged version was very drinkable. Lacked the fruity edge id hoped for.","Perth, Western Australia, AUSTRALIA","kook"
3034,"2006-02-24",3.7,"Top drop this, but Id love to try in during a shorter session (a lot shorter...). Poured a nice orange amber colour. Aroma was full of citrus and stonefruits, and alcohol. I know its 10%, but it didnt hide it too well. Highly bitter flavour, which suited me fine. Pretty sweet too. Hopefully Ill get to try it again.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","bridge"
3034,"2006-02-22",4.4,"Pours a pleasant clear amber, with golden highlights. Decent head, which results in some thick lacing. Smells lovely, fresh wet hops, candy, piney. The sugery candy is intriguing. A hint of what might be to come after time.I let this one warm a hair more than I would have. But warming it really brought out some flavors slightly overshadowed in the cooler version I had the first time around. Big big hops, but only a passing attempt at balance. The sugery candy comes out, but only after a full frontal attack on the tastebuds by a team of piney hops and grassy hops.Oily and a bit hot. I suspect time will ease off the alchohol a bit, and produce a real winner.","Portland, Oregon, USA","jennajlover"
3034,"2006-02-18",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 20, 2006 2003 bottle.  Deep amber with a wispy head. Aroma is super malty, caramel, alcohol and balanced hops. Very bitter with pine all the way through in the initial taste.  Some caramel and malt, but oxidization and card board are present (cant vouch for the storage of this brew).  Also taste leather. Body is full and bitter.   
This was good but I think that it was poorly cared for before I got it.  I think the 2004 will be better as I have stored this my self.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"
3034,"2006-02-16",4.9,"Barley wines are usually 7-12% abv with some examples going even higher. Old Numbskull clocks in at a mighty 10% abv, and you might indeed be feeling like a numbskull, if you dont be careful with this one. Know your limitations, and know when to say when with a beer this potent. Old Numbskull is a very traditional British inspired barley wine, and it pays tribute to the British classics, but with American/West Coast flare, is bolder in hop character and alcohol content than most British examples. This beer is brewed with imported Marris Otter and Crystal malts from the UK. It is then hopped with imported British Fuggles, then dry hopped with Mt. Hood and Centennial hops. Old Numbskull Barley Wine Ale pours to a beautiful, ruby red color, with virtually no head, and a soft carbonation. The nose on this beer is very inviting, with fragrant herbal and citrus hop aromas ,paired with aromas of plummy estery fruit, sweet malt, hints of pipe tobacco, and peppery alcohol. The palate is lush and full on the tongue with a multitude of complex flavors. Sweet malt, caramel, toffee, and butter scotch, marry with flavors of plum and peppery alcohol. Old Numbskull finishes with more complex malty and estery fruit flavors, then ends with some citrus hop bite, and a warming alcohol burn that lingers. This is a wonderful, relaxing, sipping brew, perfect as as a cocktail after work, an after dinner drink, or a nice beer to sip and relax with a good book or movie. It would work well with a number of rich deserts as well. Retailing for $10 a bottle, it is a very good value, and as stated, this beer can, and will improve with age.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"
3034,"2006-02-14",4.3,"Draft @ Papago.  The Draft pour was much darker black than the bottle pour which was more on the orange amber side.  When I first got a hint of the aroma of this beer I was overwhelmed with the anticipation of getting to taste this wonderful brew.  Wonderful fruity notes and spiced hops jump out of the glass.  Flavor is wonderful bitter chocolate, mild but rich coffee notes, the perfect blend of woody spiced hops to balance the mildly sweet notes. Rich and very satisfying.  The alcohol mixes perfectly in this beer to create a world class barely wine.  I was just blow away but how much I enjoyed this beer.  Will drink and peruse this beer again and again.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","PullMeABeer"
3034,"2006-02-14",3.9,"Medium brown colour with a small  off-white head. Sweet light roasted malty aroma with a hint of caramel and alcohol.

3034,"2006-02-11",4.0,"Reddish brown body with a small head. Aroma is spicy and citrusy hops, and the usual malt base. Flavor is the same, and its an interesting BW in that its medium bodied. Nothing watery or heavy here. Very drinkable. Dry finish.","California, USA","ABUSEDGOAT"
3034,"2006-02-09",4.3,"2003 vintage on tap at Stuffed Sandwich. A nice dark pour, Malty, but the alcohol jumps out at you, not in a bad way, very warming, Im sure its mellowed abit, a great beer, cant wait to try the barrel aged, but If its equal to this one, Ill be happy.","Saarlouis, GERMANY","Saarlander"
3034,"2006-02-05",4.1,"This bomber came into my possession during a recent stop at Hi Time Wine in Costa Mesa, while I was traveling to California.  The presentation was handsome, with the green Champagne style bomber being adorned by silver neck foil, and white and blue lettering.

As I poured out the contents into a tulip, a classic looking barleywine emerged.  The color was garnet amber, with a clear body, and a sparse head.  Carbonation was rather low, and the head died down to long legged lacing.  Aromatically, the west coast hops were not as prominent as some of the other examples of the style.  The smell was balanced, or some would even say driven, by the malt, with a musty sweet odor evoking more English examples.  Deeper breaths however clearly indicated the presence of piney American hops.

Taste was deliciously sippable, with the initial impression being made by sweet and caramel malt until the citric hop oils literally took over.  Finish was peppery and pungent.  The beer felt sticky and a little coarse on the palette (which was undoubtedly due to a young age).  I can see this one aging quite nicely, but alas I only bought this single bomber.  Drinkability was good despite the intensity, since I like the characteristics it possessed.  Not the epitome of the style, but a very good example.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
3034,"2006-02-05",4.1,"Bottle.  Pours murky reddish brown color with a thick,fluffy beige head that lasts.  What initially comes to mind is a cItrusy hop aroma, but a lot more.  There is some caramel and alcohol as well.  This smells like it is going to be a beast.  Taste is the citrus hops at first, but then it mellows with caramel,  toasted marshmellow and honey.  Finishes like bittersweet chocolate.  The alcohol is really present too, especially as it warms.  Fairly easy drinking brew.   Best for the style Ive had thus far.","Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, USA","madcow75"
3034,"2006-01-31",4.5,"Damn, there are a lot of things going on with this beauty. The aroma was nice, definite notes of hops were there along with a whiff of alcohol. But the aroma is not what makes this a great drink. Sharing this one with my brother, the appearance looked something akin to sparking apple juice albeit darker. Definite carbonation going on there. Taste was strong, notes of a sherry or an aged whisky/sherry combo was nice. The burn was there of the 10% but not overpowering. What was suprising was the amount of hop to it at the end, which put a great twist on things. Glad I waited this long to finally try out one the best barleywines Ive ever had!","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

3034,"2006-01-20",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2006 This beer doesnt feel like a 4.0 to me. Amazing pour of cloudy murky deep red Pontiac sunset. Fire and flowing orange. Head of soapy ivory. Standard lucious barleywine aroma, I love so much. Reminiscent of my early days of b-wines. Wow. Pine trees, hibiscus, mango candy, oranges dipped in chocolate all mingle in the flavor. But, eventually this is all swamped with hot hops, that are just a little too over the top for me. I bet this is good with lots of age. Needs to let the hops settle and gather a touch of oxidation (how often do you say that?). Surprsingly chocolate, with cherries dipped in choco liquer, laced with cinnamon on toast. Hops burst onto the scene, then fade into a supporting role, with a stable of lemongrass to round. A little acerbic for me. But, Im a stickler on b-wines. Middle is fruit and rich with creamy apricots and figs. Finish is a long toasted hazlenut and roasted prok. Light artisanal butter run. Three-tiered and respected for that, but the hops are just too out of control and unbalanced for me, like a wild young labrador retriever amongst the rushes. Slightly jarring.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3034,"2006-01-19",5.0,"UPDATED: AUG 21, 2007 Pours like liquid caramel w/ a full, creamy spattered froth hat just sits there. Suerb head retention never really reducing but leaves a thick and  creamy downy canopy. Nice! Aromas of strict, crunchy hops dominate. Full nectar w/ relaxed 501 effers that create a soft cottony texture. This brew is bold yet refined w/ a defined sweetness.  A huge hoppy character (Robo Hop)climbs from a deep subterranian chamber and fights its way through the malty sludge w/ battle axes whaling. Chopping, slicing, cutting yet in the end losing the battle but leaving its mark on the tabel of history. A very generous brew giving and giving again. Citrus rind sweetness w/ nuances of cherry, caramel, peach, leather. The finish is very long  and sweet and has a mild bittering w/ a  lingering asprin tingle that once was Robo Hop. Highly recommended.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"
3034,"2006-01-16",4.4,"Bottle, courtesy of the Danes (and some Yanks) @ Delerium Café, Brussel, March 2005. Hazy brown, thin off white head and moderate condition. Big sticky sweet barley wine nose but with a solid resinous hop note. Smooth and sweet in the mouth with intense toffee maltiness mixing well with hefty hop biterness. Long lingering bittersweet finish with caramel, burnt toffee and hop bitterness all shouting loudly.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"
3034,"2006-01-15",4.4,"This is a true barleywine.  High in alcohol but holds well.  It has  sweet honey like taste.  Definitely one of the better barleywines Ive ever had.","Massachusetts, USA","deadmonkees"
3034,"2006-01-12",4.1,"750 ml bottle, thanks to DarkElf!  Deep, amber/garnet with only a ring of toffee head to cap it off.  Huge aroma of plums, ethanol, and lots of other assorted maltage.  Flavor began with a floral and alcohol-ey bite on the tip of the tongue.  Heavy dark fruit malts, grassy hop bitters, caramel sweetness, and a bit more alcohol followed.  Finish was long, warming, and carried through a whole bunch of fruity malt, bitterness, and alcohol.  Malty smoothness across the middle of the palate that transitioned to big bitterness on the backend and finish... stuck around for quite a while.  Great brew, but I would have preferred a little less bitterness at the end.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
3034,"2006-01-12",4.2,"[Aged aprox. 18 months] I pured this one into the wrong glass, a Schmidts mug that my father in law had around. There was no head while pouring and only a small hint of one showed after. As I peered down into this beer, it reminded me of honey. Thick looking with one bubbels that seemd to be susbended just below the surface. The aroma is immediatly evident, sweet like candy with some citrus notes. Doesnt seem as thick as it looks, though it has a coating effect. Initially there are nice sweet malt tones with some fruit like qualities. Citrus hops then a nice entrance of only slightly bitter hops. A really good barley wine.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"
3034,"2006-01-11",3.4,"I hate to bring down the average of this beer, but I must have aged it too long or something.  I bought this in Portland at Johns and brought it right back to Illinois to a home in my beer fridge-stored at a loving 45 degrees for probably 8 months and I looked forward to trying this beer with great anticipation.  The aroma is nice-bready, and spicy, but no hops.  The palate seems a bit understated for a 10% ABV beer and just doesnt jump out at me.  Will definitely rerate with a fresh bottle the next time Im in PDX.","Glen Ellyn, Illinois, USA","HopasaurusRex"

3034,"2006-01-10",4.7,"Numbskull is a classic barley wine, big malts and hops to create a beer that is strong, malty, complex and full of character. Numbskull has an inviting aroma from the combination of specialty malts and I cam taste varieties of Willamette Valley hops including Magnums, East Kent Goldings, and Chinook I think anyways. I do taste fruit aromas, along with clean ethanol, caramel, honey as they say.

3034,"2006-01-03",3.6,"Couldnt decide if this is one of the best beers Ive sampled, or akin to drinking Pine-o-Clean. The answer probably lies somewhere in the middle. It was certainly a memorable experience, and one Id like to repeat without the benefit of two dozen other beers beforehand. It poured a rich copper, with a shortish head. The nose was thickly alcoholic, with traces of juicy fruit, toffee and pine needles. Terrific full mouthfeel, just lovely. And then the taste... Well, its not shy with its flavours. Its about as subtle as a headbutt from a French prop forward. Its like having someone stand with his lips pressed against your ear screaming ""HOPS! HOPS MOTHERFUCKER, HOPS!"" Its mouth puckeringly bitter. I could feel my teeth crumbling and my hair falling out. There was caramel in the mix but its lost in that resinous wash of hops and peppery alcohol. A cruel beer.

Powerful malt character with some Christmas pudding, quite sticky, and quite a lot of piney hops just like the other Alesmiths Ive had. It seemed just like Yulesmith only with more malt, and Yulesmith seemed like the IPA with more of everything, which I find a little frustrating for reasons unknown. But the thing that really got me was the alcohol character. I mean I already had a headache but this just tipped me over the edge, unfortunately.

3034,"2005-12-03",3.8,"750 mL from The Andersons, Columbus, OH.  Lovely pour: Dark red, a little syrupy-looking, and a medium, frothy, easy-to-resummon head.  Extremely fragrant; exploding with malty aroma along with orange and brown sugar and, strangely, banana.  Flavor is just knock-you-down strong; asskicking malt with a killer hop aftertaste; I love it, but its simply too much.  Thick, moderately sticky, but a bit cloying.  6 oz. of this would have been enough; instead, I drank all 750 mL, and it was admittedly tough.  Good beer, but just too over the top, even for me.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sfontain"

Big and brash with a big mix of grainy caramel malt and citric hop. My notes say ""nice mouthfeel"" which isnt exactly too revealing but do think it works, which I dont always find to be the case with the malt/hop conjunction in these big US beers. But I still think I prefer my barley wines to be a little more refined and subtle, hence it doesnt quite achieve top marks from me.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

Im not exactly sure what year this is from 2003 or mid 2004?  though, I feel a fresh bottle of this from the current year would blow me away with flavor, and thats exactly how i prefer my barleywines. I admit age does beers like this justice but then again it alters other benefits in exchange.  I didnt notice as much characterisitcs as i had expected such as a sticky palate texture or extreme bitterness. Its just not the same as what i could imagine it tasting new from a fresh batch.

Aroma is nectar, sweet floral hops, golden raisins and grenadine along with some brown sugar undertones.  Flavor is delicious - smooth oak, creamy caramel and maple syrup.  Orange-pine like qualities derived from the sweet hop profile.  Sugary stickiness that melds the mouth shut.  This is some good shit.  Signature barleywine finish, hinting towards alcohol presence but ending in a sweet citric bitterness.  Huge thanks to tpkenned for making #400 special!","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Huge malty resin aroma.  Loads of flavor was unexpected because of the lighter body.  Typical barleywine style flavors of raisins, caramel, citrus bitterness and alcohol.  Seemed a little underpowered albeit well crafted.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","entertheiceman"

Well-made but not unique, with caramel and toasty malts dominating the flavor profile along with piney, grapefruity hops.

3034,"2005-02-10",4.5,"Thanks to TChrome for this one.  Alesmith beers, to me, are like women with their ankles behind their ears....I just find them irresistable.  This one pours slightly turbid ruby, with a big of-white head.  Aroma of malt, tons of fruit, hops, cognac, cabernet, black pepper.  Tastes malty, very fruity, with a finishing warming sensation at culmination.  I noted cherries, berries, scotch, black pepper, jalapenos, cognac, cabernet, oak, vanilla, caramel, and almonds in the mid to late palate.  SMooth finish with a slight astringency and a very slight surfactant edge.  This one is great, but Im not sure it beats the complexity of Hair of The Dog Doggie Claws and Heavyweight Old Salty, or the smoothness of Full Sail Barleywine, or the mishmash heavy hitter aspect of Avery the Beast, but its right up there with all of them.  Id love to try these side by side with all these.  Then again, if you did a ""side-by-side"" with all those, youd be passed out in the crotch of Star Jones.  This is an awesome barleywine.

It says to leave the brewers yeast in the bottle. Looks like I was wrong again. So, after apparently messing up in every conceivable way, Did the stuff stand a chance? Oh yeah. Pours a brilliant but cloudy copper with minimal head. Big caramel and toffee aroma, with significant notes of fresh hops, vanilla, and charcoal. The first flavor is peppery, salty, piney citrus hops. Smooth, viscous malt flavors emerge as it warms, as do notes of cognac. The caramel that was prevalent in the aroma emerges slowly in the mouth, much more of a bit player. The palate is nearly perfect - oily, but just the right amount of carbonation.

The aroma has that recognizable Ale Smith sweetness to it.  I must say I am quite impressed with the aroma because it is fruity and also has a hard liquor element to it.  The taste is very strong in terms of the alcohol.  It reminds me more of hard liquor then beer.  Its great though and from the best brewery in the world.  Quite good, but a little too strong for me in terms of the alcohol.  There is still a smoothness to it despite the strength of the alcohol.

Aroma spicy-raisiny malt with some pine and a little citrus and notes of watermelon and strawberry.  At first, theres a salty hops feel followed by strong pine flavour that does not comandeer the taste, but gives way to a sweet raisiny aged malt that leaves one licking his lips.

There is a lot more going on here that I would have to drink another one to most likely identity in this very complex and wonderful smell. The taste has a big sweetness up front that tastes of caramel, rich fruits and spiciness. The hops are present and become more evident as this one warms and creates a bitter dry finish. Mouthfeel is thick and rich and has decent carbonation. This is a very smooth barley wine that seems to improve with age from what I have read.

3034,"2004-09-14",3.3,"So Im really confused as to why this is rated so high. I mean, I love barleywines but this stuff just doesnt do it for me. Its big, its sweet, its malty, the 10% ABV puts the hurt on but I found this to be somewhat lacking in flavor and complexity. It smells nice with whiffs of raisin, molasses, honey--really, all things malty but the palate is somewhat flat and boring, the color dull and dark and the hop presence a bit too reserved (not always a problem but in this case the beer definitely needed some more spunk).","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Murky, nearly opaque dark ochre with yeast particulates vaguely evident, virtually no head.  Massively vinous aroma, deep burnt caramel evident on second nosing, slight hints of bitter orange, alcohol and cocoa.  On the tongue, restrained bitterness, caramelly sweetness in the background, firm malt and a light herbal quality.  Strong alcoholic and hoppy burn towards the finish; a little on the thin side  This is far from a knockout for me...on the whole, Im not so blown away by this brewery to date.  Very average barley wine with the aroma being the most distinguishing feature. 3.5 total

It poured a small head of mostly diminished finely sized off-white colored bubbles that left behind a fair lacing.  The body was a transparent brown color and was softly carbonated.  It had a malt hop aroma with a mild vinous note with some caramel.  The mouth feel was initially mild with a lingering caramel malt bite in the finish.

3034,"2004-06-06",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 1, 2005 1999 vintage sampled June 2004.  Thanks to Bob (herbjones) for coming through on these vintage AleSmiths.  What a hell of a treat this was.  My friend and I split this.  Hes never tried barleywine, dosent even care that much about beer but he mentioned right away how good this was.  Wonderful mahogany color, with burnished copper tones, light ambers and red swirls.  Aroma has intense english toffee characteristics, old, soily hops, and a big funky yeastiness that blew me away.  Due to the unfiltered/bottle conditioned nature of this beer, the flavors have developed wonderfully these 5 years.  Wonderful caramel and toffee malt flavors, with a now subtle hops profile (soily, earthy, dusty, doughy).  This thing had so much personality and my favorite part was the yeast.  Somehow this thing reminded me of a belgian, I dont know if it was all due to the yeast, or maybe just the interplay of the malt and oxidation, but wow was it unique.  The flavor was as close to perfect as I can imagine.  No harsh tones, low carbonation and a huge, full body.  As much as I respect Old Horizontal, the low filtration on this beer puts this a notch above that one.  This is why I love barleywines. MAN I LOVE THIS BREWERY!!!  10/5/10/5/202003 bottle thanks to EDA!  This one is still obviously young.  This beer takes time to mellow out.  Bitter hops still apparent, but the flavor underneath the up-front hops is as good as it gets, IMHO.  A mix of English and Belgian yeast flavors, light caramel and toffee traces, sticky and just full of flavor.  Ill have to cellar the 2003 another couple of years to see if it truly matches the elegance and craftsmanship of the 1999.  Rerate  2003 bottle sampled in June 2005 at RBSG.  Hmm, the hops still are front and center, but some sticky caramel malt peeks through nicely.  Bitter and lightly astringent on the end.  Seems not nearly as magical and unique as the 1999 and though its still a marvelously executed barleywine, it would have to make a lot of progress as far as yeast apparency (the 2003 has almost none) to really bring it up to the 1999 level.  Or maybe my imagination has just gone running with the 1999.  Fortunately Im well stocked on all vintages so I will be well able to test my theories.  8/5/8/3/152005 vintage  Sampled young on 10/29/05.  Actually prefer this one young to even the 1 or 2 year old 03.  The hops are not nearly as bitter, and while I still think the hops impart too much harshness, its only a minor problem for me.  The malt is very well done, toffee and caramel with an almost candy-sugar like feel.  Orange peel, raisins, grapefruit and a nice earthy, dry malt flavor on the finish.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Pours a cherry wood color that you can't see through but it does allow light through.

Aroma is big with caramel and candied cherries covered in warm toffee.  Alcohol is also very present on the nose.

Flavor is also big with lots of up front sweetness that is soft caramelly candy.  Spicy hops come through also in a fairly big way, this is a really big beer so in reality the hops are big but relative to the rich malts, they take a backseat, but don't back down by any means.  Alcohol warms the finish in a very satisfying way.

Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, and fairly viscous.

Drinkability, while being hurt by the magnitude of the beer and the alcohol level, is quite good and I'll be enjoying the rest of this bottle with my homemade Arrabiatta sauce on penne noodles.

Aroma displays extremely complex malt profile which Im bound to fall in love with. Potent maple, honey, caramel, cookies, molasses treats. Assertive fruitiness (lots of mango, plenty of peaches, dried bananas, oranges, watermelon, cantaloupe). It smells thick too with notes of bubble gum and brown sugar. Hard to describe overall, but every flavor is well presented and balanced by a subtle hop character and frankly, the best dessert pie never smelled that good. Taste displays more of that bubblegum I adore along with that chemy melon and soft marshmallows. After a few sips, the bitterness gets very pronounced, grapefruity, dry and bitter, a bit too much for me to appreciate in great quantities. Its a little sad though because its my new favorite Alesmith and prefered California barley wine and there was more alcohol than I had hoped for in the taste despite being completely hidden in the aroma. Mouthfeel is top notch though, smooth as hell, velvety, chewy and creamy, medium-bodied and showing a perfect amount of carbonation. Did I say I like the aroma?  Upon resampling, the aroma is still remarkable, but the palate is really too dry and I feel it really takes out fmor the enjoyment. Agressive finish. I lower from 4.4 to 4.2.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
3034,"2004-03-21",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2005 Re-rate (16-Jan-05 - 8-3-7-3-14=3.5):  Sweet, round, heavy, dark and pendulous malt aroma with some hoppiness.  Opaque, dark brown with large-bubbled, thin, tan head that recedes to cover.  Heavy malt flavour seems dry and over-attenuated.  Dry and very bitter in the finish.  Quite roasty.  Overbalanced towards the bitterness.  Mild fruitiness and light phenols are overwhelmed by the hops.  Definite strong alcohol flavour and warming.  Very dry, somewhat puckering.  Low carbonation.  Bottle (2004) enjoyed back-to-back with the barrel aged version with asheft, beerbuzzmontreal, MartinT, muzzlehatch, Rastacouere and Yowie.


Original rating (3/21/04 - 9-5-8-3-14=3.9): 2003 edition. Citrusy grapefruit (cascade hops?) clean refreshing nose with a biscuity malt aroma and lots of fruity esters - banana, peach, apricot, plum - maybe a bit of bubblegum. Glowing orange colour with decent white head that recedes with good lacing. Big hop flavour with excellent supporting malt base - toasty, biscuity. Hops are citrusy with a vegetal undertone. Nice and complex. Some yeast flavours noted as well. Mouthfeel is incredible - thick, chewy, smooth. Big body. Some sherry sweetness. Just a bit sticky with a dry finish. Hops build and become a bit much by the end of the drink. Seems like an Imperial IPA. Green bottle.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
3034,"2004-03-07",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2015 500!  Thanks Eyedrinkale!  Never thought I would hit this mark in a year.  Big thanks to all those who contribute to this site and the many brewers who have dedicated themselves to the craft.  Deep burgundy in color, just a trace of a head.  Big aroma, grapefruit notes clawing their way through a thick veil of syrupy malts.  Initial flavors of toffee and molasses give way to a mixture of tropical fruits and solid pine notes.  Finishes clean and bitter, a flavor that hangs in the mouth long after each swallow.  Well made and delicious, this could be quite spectacular with some age to mellow out the edges.  The 10% is almost imperceptable.  A beer worthy of being #500 and of its Top 50 ranking.  RERATE:  11 years later, finally getting it here in Virginia.  Draft this time.  Having this really brought back quite the flood of memories from the old trading days.  No change to the rating.  Like the Grand Cru, my notes were shockingly similar.  I would only say that it was slighltly smoother than my recollection, with less harsh alcohol notes.  Still a great beer.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
3034,"2004-03-03",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 22, 2004 (750 ml bottle) AleSmith puts out great beers which results in high expectations, but this one is a little disappointing.  Malty, drier than most, and fairly bitter initially, but the beer has a slightly toasty, dark roasted flavor throughout, especially in the finish and is moderately bitter with a slightly harsh bite on the palate.  Sweet malty nose matches the flavor fairly well.  Reddish mahogany in color and clear, but a dense paste of sediment is on the bottom of the bottle.  Off-white head is small on the pour, disappears quickly and leaves no lacing.Rerated on 08-Nov-04.  This is an aged bottle from 1999, so its 5 years old.  Again, its very malty and only moderately sweet.  But its very smoky in the finish, and that sharp alcohol bite is gone, so aging has really smoothed out this barleywine.  New ratings are based on this session.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

I can't say for sure but perhaps as the first beer of the night it would have fared even better - and it was awesome as it was. Potent, smooth, almost nutty, hoppy aroma.

3034,"2004-02-01",4.0,"The first thing I noticed about this beer was the hops bursting from the bottle the second the cap was removed. This isn't entirely rare, but slightly unusual for barley wines. There are definitely some strong hop influences in the flavor as well, backed up with a great mouthfeel and very solid dark malty hues, although the beer never really lends itself to the sweeter side of things, always keeping that hoppiness at the forefront. I noticed some resiney pine as well, perhaps a bit of grassiness too. Nothing too complex I felt, actually bears a great deal of resemblence to the Stone Guardian. Very tasty, although I may have been a tad bit fooled if someone were to tell me this were an Imperial IPA.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"

3034,"2004-01-29",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 27, 2004 1/29/04 I was stoked to try my first west coast barleywine.  Only thing is, it wasnt completely fresh. Poured a cloudy orange-brown color with no head.  Smelled a bit like oranges and cloves.  Tasted kinda like orange liquer.  The palate was decent expect on the roof of my mouth where it kind of felt like a runny egg.  Try not to take this rating to serious, the beer was still pretty good for being opened and re-sealed 4 days ago.  Ive just been a little too ""under the weather"" to drink it.  This all gives me more incentive to re-rate it.

12/26/04 Finally got a chance to re-rate a fresh one thanks to Santa.  Much better.  Flavors are prunes, dates, and a subtle carmel.  Great carbination, so smooth.  Hides the alcohol well.","New Providence, Pennsylvania, USA","axilla"

Re Rate 2/19/05: Bright redish brown with a thin white head. Malty, toasty aroma with hints of cherry and molasses. Flavor is much more hoppy than I remember.

3034,"2004-01-21",4.7,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2004 750 ml. green champagne bottle. Capped, but not corked. 2000 batch. Acquired thru a trade with Eyedrinkale. No freshness date seen or noticed. Poured out a cloudy, orangish - caramel colored beer. It had a thin head, but it left more than a decent lacing around the edges of my tulip glass. I've been waiting a long time to try this beer, so let's begin. Aromas are of caramel, slightly smoky malts, and candi sugar. Sweet aromas overpower the hops, which struggle to maintain a presence in all the malts.
Slight aromas of alcohol, way off in the background. Tastes are incredible. Chewy caramel, roasted oatmeal, slight fruitiness, and strong English malts. I'll wager this beer is made with English grains. Maybe some Marris Otter or something along those lines.
Thick, viscous mouthfeel, but not syrupy. Not cloying at all.
More along the lines of a well aged Samichlaus. Finishes dry, and with a biscuit taste as well. An incredible take on the style of beer.
Much more an English Barleywine than an American version.","","Cobra"

3034,"2004-01-08",4.3,"Got it at the brewery. Pours with a very typical bottle conditioned head. Lots of frothy bubbles. Lots of yeast and other sediment. I think this was a year or more old. Light syrupy amber, surprisingly trasluscent. Smells of alcohol, ripe prunes, papaya and maybe even starfruit. Very palatable. Even dangerously drinkable. The hops at this point do not attack the front but instead spread there wonder over the back of the tongue and lie there long after the glass is empty. As it warms, a honey-like sweetness becomes apparet and the alcohol begins to bounce around in your brain like a candy-kid at a rave. Never do the flavors become cloying. This ale is menacingly enjoyable from start to finish and the only negative to speak of is that I have only one bottle. Woe is me!","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","erway"

3034,"2004-01-06",4.4,"1/4/04.  Poured out of 750 mL bottle, bought at A&J Liquor in Covina, CA 11/28/03.  2000 Vintage.  My 100th rating, and I made it a special one.  Dark, dark amber color-- slightly opaque.  Small, rocky head that lingers very thin with clumpy lacing.  Unbelieveable nose-- fruit, caramel, and mellowing malts with some slight mustiness blend deliciously with the apparent alcohol complement and a light corkiness.  Medium-dark caramel malts with hint of burnt flavor.  Some pale sweetness and some muted, darkly bitter, leathery hops.  Flavor expands smoothly and impressively.  Finish just explodes into a tremendous blossom, drying with bitterness and a very long, delicate berry sweetness.  Medium-full body with man different flavors swirling and dancing on the palate, all taking the spotlight at different moments.  Sticky on the lips.  Just want to savor it and let it sit on the mouth-- but if you let it sit too long it almost overwhelms you.  Could definitely still age a bit longer and improve, but I'd like to have the alcohol pulled back a bit, and I don't know if that'd happen.  Also, bitterness of hops is a little too prevalent/prominent, which is funny, because I didn't think the same thing about the newly-bottle '03 version.  Also, it's odd, but the lacing became tremendous on my second pour from the bottle.  One of my favorite beers around.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

3034,"2003-12-09",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 30, 2005 This beer when held up to the light is a hazy copper-orange color, otherwise it is a fairly drab amber color.  It is topped by a fairly dense tan head.  The aroma at first is all hops; grapefruit & flower nectar.  As I smell more the malt comes out in the aroma.  The malt aroma helps to thicken the aroma of the hops in this beer.  The taste is surprising in its restraint from bitterness.  The hop flavor is here in full force though  The body of this beer is like a beefy giant.  I find myself enjoying this beer quite a bit.  The interplay of the malt and hop is quite well done.  The predominant taste is that of a hoppy nectar, there is a solid malt character & the bitterness is fairly subtle for an over hopped big beer (which I really like here).  There seems to be some light oxidation notes here (perhaps a hint of sherry), which helps to further the complexity.  Quite enjoyable and I have a full 750 to savor this evening.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3034,"2003-10-26",4.4,"Nice orange reddish hue with lasting off-white head and good lace. The aroma of this beer is wonderful, get the piney and grapefruit character of an IPA with the malty, sweet fruity and spicy character of an Belgium strong ale. Additional grain and yeast esters as well on the nose. The taste is almost shocking in it's sublime attack on the palate. First, you get a smash of piney hops then followed closely by a deep malty and spicy, almost Scottish ale like, complex tones. Extreme balance with both ends of the taste spectrum carefully measured against each other. A nice fruity component adds to the rich and lush flavors. Medium to full-bodied with a great mouthfeel, this barley wine (if you can call it such) rocks! The lingering grapefruit twang is almost too much and is my only major knock against this brew.

Smell is all heft! Lots of thick malts, rich, caramel-tastic, darkly sweet and deep, some fruitly darkenedness with a heft of hops as well with piney resin thats highly floral and sweet. Nice alcoholic warmth much like a brandy over the top in the aroma as well. Yum! Aroma-rific!

Taste is mellowing smooth and warm with a good amount of deep and thick malts, a bit chewy and lightly roasty sweet, good caramel and fainted earthyness, some darker fruits show through with plum and fig, some mango, all showing the true front of a barleywine; malty! Hops then come in with a super fine and resiny bitterness thats quite easy to handle and has some light pineyness and deep floral notes. Seemed to lose some complexity as it warmed, it really mellowed out. The mellowness made it much more easy to drink, but the enjoyment level dropped some though as far as the flavor punch. 

Solid soothing medium body feel with a smooth creamy lingering chewy finish with some warmth hidden well but acceptable in its presense of what is traceable amounts mostly coming through the nose.

3034,"2003-10-12",3.9,"Rating #215.. So my Saturday beer tasting culminated with Old Numbskull, and thanks to Bigbadbear63 for sending me the Smiths. 
The Numbskull consistently poured a deep and robust mahogany colored body with little to know head, although it did leave behind a slight ring of lacing. 
I think an accurate description of this beers aroma and flavor is, a syrupy caramelized brown sugar and grapefruit. This beer has serious Grapefruit zestyness, nice hefty malt additions but its really just Enormous Hops that give this Barley Wine a smooth dry finish. Notes of plums, figs, and pares are also additions that bring depth to this beer.
 I must admit that I was impressed by the Numbskull but it was very similar to the Ale Smith IPA; I wonder if they accidentally bottled the Barley Wine in the IPA bottle, yeah probably not, but the similarities are remarkable.","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

As I poured this beer into the glass, I see dark amber goodness with a white thin head. Not much in the nose..first drink seems somewhat two dimesional, hop bitterness and alcohol.

The hops are much more prevalent in this newer version than in the aged ones, but it is still well balanced.  A great barleywine, and yet another great Alesmith beer.

1999 sampled on 12/23/2003: Again, more difficulty opening the bottle, but this time it was the cork that broke off into little pieces that fell into the beer.  Aroma is still full of toffee and caramel malt, but is showing more age.  Good sweetness and dark fruit complexity within, but this is probably past its prime, although it has held up very well.

2000 sampled on 7/2/2003: After the difficulty of opening the bottle, the beer poured an amber orange color with a thin white head.  Aroma of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies and grapes.

Aged tremendously well.  I love this brewery!","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

This hazy amber brew has a small, off-white, creamy head with good lacing. The head is fully lasting.
Wow, what a great tasting barleywine.
Lightly sweet and moderately malty up front. Almost perfectly balanced by the dry, fruity bitterness on the backside. Warm alcohol feel in the mouth, throat and stomache. Its really more of a feeling than a flavor. I love it. Woodsy (American White Oak?) flavor throughout. Hints of honey, caramel and fuzzy fruits as well. Full-bodied. Lively carbonation and a slightly creamy/slightly alcoholic mouthfeel. A medium length, lightly bitter, lightly pungent and mostly dry finish. Lingering flavors of honey and alcohol on the palate at the very end of the delightful finish. This is, without a doubt, the most unique barleywine I have ever tasted. In the aroma and the flavor, this barleywine resembles an excellent, hopped lambic with a ridiculously high alcohol content. I love lambics, I love barleywines, I love this beer. A very very high score for this masterpiece. Thanks go out to herbjones for this great beer.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

It pours up nicely, with a rich light ruby body capped by a foamy off-white head that disappears with reluctance.  The flavor is also complex, with a nice malt base, with a good dose of hops on top.  As it warms, the alcohol and hops intrude more on ones senses.  It sits nicely in the mouth.

The head is made of the smallest bubbles that I've seen in a while and they make some of the best lacing that I've ever seen.  The palate deserves a 6, due to a unique creaminess that it has.

Deep red-orange hue with apparent effervescence, but head fades quickly to a slight ring.  Flavor profile is mellow for a West Coast barleywine.  Some laid-back caramel, a bit of citrus (both flavor and feel), spices, and towards the finish, the noble hops spicy bitterness becomes much more distinct.  Palate is largely dry.  Aftertaste has both malt and hop balance along with a bit of alcohol, more felt than tasted.  This would be great to lay down for another year and a half or so, I have a feeling it would improve.

My worries abruptly ended as I witnessed loads of tiny bubbles hitting the copper liquid with such buoyancy.  The dense and sticky bubbles were a sheer delight to view.  The aroma is packed with hops (citric), alcohol, leather, brown sugar, oranges, and pineapples.  The palate is just another excellent demonstration of this beers utmost quality.  It exhibits characteristics of a fine English barleywine with its lush malt profile.  But the substantial hop bitterness lets you know it is indeed an American barleywine at its finest.  Creamy, perfect CO2 level, sticky, slightly vinous, and semi-dry are just a few to name.  Juicy dark raisins, as if picked this morning, were exhibited, as were oranges, brown sugar, discerning chocolate richness, spruce/pine, and a delectable maple syrup sweetness.
