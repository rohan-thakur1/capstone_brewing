3346,"2017-06-15",3.4,"On tap at the brewery. Pours a milky hazy straw gold with a medium sized white head. Musky and juicy on the nose, mango with a hint of onion lurking, but mostly tropical with a bunch of juice and citrus. Ultimately might be over the top for a blonde, but still rather pretty, so whatevs. Medium bodied, big and oniony right away. First flavor impression is that it taskes like a mouthful of green onion over mangos. Wheat, soft and musky, thins out quite a bit, but understandable at 4%. Musk, wheat, grain, soft melon and more green onion. Decent, but not very even.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
3346,"2017-06-11",3.9,"16 oz can from the last release. Pours bright yellow with a thin off white head. Aroma is lightly dank and a bit earthy with tropical fruits, mostly peach and citrus. 
 A bit grassy and green and really reminds me a lot of the Mosaic The Substance that these folks brew. The body and feel is different of course with this having light cracker and blonde grain hints. Bitterness is mellow with a crisp texture. A lot of flavor for such a low ABV brew and it doesnt come off watery like so many other session IPAs. Mouthfeel is quite good.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3346,"2017-06-05",4.0,"Tap at York River Landing in York, ME. Pours Avery hazy yellow with moderate, foamy, white head. Nose is a delightful citrus assault with notes of biscuit and a hint of dank. Taste is bitter. Mouthfeel crisp and refreshing. Excellent!

3346,"2016-09-26",3.6,"La bière est blonde paille, si trouble que lon ne voit rien au travers, avec un petit collet de mousse dun doigt. Le nez est intense, avec beaucoup de houblons fruités et exotique en approche. Je crois reconnaitre. Des pêches, des mangues, et du fruit de la passion seulement au nez. En bouche, lespèce darrière-goût savonneux du houblon me frappe dès la première gorgée. La bière a un corps plutôt mince, ce qui est fréquemment le cas avec des sessions. Le houblon donne un goût fruité à la bière, avec pêches et citrons bien présents. Au final cest une biere agréable, bien faite, mais on oserait en demander plus pour le hype de cette brasserie.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","LouisP"

3346,"2016-08-21",4.1,"On tap at Farmhouse Tap and Grill.
This was poured into a long stemmed taster.
The appearance was a thick hazy burnt yellow color with a thin white foamy head. Barely any lacing.
The aroma starts off with some sweet citrus rind and pulp bursting over some grapefruit rind. A huge amount of sweet grassiness comes in and then some sweet danky onion.
The flavor pretty much is the same with a nice bittersweet aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice unyieldingly smooth texture. Carbonation runs light with a great crisp sessionability about it.
Overall, hot damn, what a nice session IPA, does everything its supposed to. Would definitely have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3346,"2016-06-22",3.8,"Aroma- hoppy, grapefruit and floral notes
Appearance- very hazy and light in color. Straw
Taste- hoppy but very light malt similar to a saison or maybe even a Pilsner. Would love to have more malt presence but for an attempt to make a DIPA taste sessionable it's ok.

3346,"2016-05-20",4.2,"Draught at Kings Head Pub, 5/7/16.Just pure, delightful soup. I never thought Id come this far, but I just love the appearance on the NE IPA now....this has a large, very well-retained white head atop it, as well. Body is a pale, waxen yellow with a graham cracker tint.Beautiful, just beautiful. Im glad I had HF Walden right before this. While theyve got some differences (this one being juicier and soupy) its a fun comparison. Bright lemon zest, nectarine and all sorts of dank, woody, vegetative notes with juicy pineapple and mango growing stronger as it warms. Cracker-like malts easily balance (the beauty of these ultra low bitterness/resin IPAs is that they take so little to balance) and while Bissells yeast/water doesnt have the same minerality and general charm as Hill Farmsteads, this is still a phenomenal beer with no alcohol or flaw.Dry in the flavor and fantastically juicy. Mango, pineapple, guava, juicy lime and very little bitterness. No twang that you sometimes get from Trilliums IPAs. Tight, ample, creamy carbonation.Yep, having had Lux and now this, I can officially marvel at their execution of the 4% hoppy, ultra-pale ale. Definitely the real deal and excited to get more from them.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
