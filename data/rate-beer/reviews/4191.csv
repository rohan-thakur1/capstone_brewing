Moderately roasty malty aroma with notes of bread crusts, a heavy load of caramel and a delicately touch of hoppy spice in the background. Moderately sweet, as well as mildly hoppy and roasty bitter flavour, medium to full bodied with a well-carbonated mouthfeel. Roasty malt-character in combination with caramel, crusty bready notes and a tinge of chocolate; moderately sweet malt-accented finish with a balancing level of hoppy and roasty bitterness.

4191,"2015-03-26",4.2,"Pretty dark amber, almost brown out of the sun. Thick head. Interesting aroma is hard to describe but a pleasant blend of alcohol, malt and good stuff. Amazing how dry some of these German dark beers are. It is like a new style when produced this way. Tasty dry and very smooth. Beautiful meld of malt and alcohol. Delicate chocolate liqueur winds its way through.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
4191,"2012-11-10",3.6,"Malzaromatischer Beginn mit Honignuancen. Röstaromen werden von süßlichen Noten überlagert, leicht hefig. Die Malzigkeit wird dann intensiver, sowohl der röstige als auch der süße Anteil. Aromatisch, steigende Hintergrundbitterkeit. Gelungener, vielleicht auf Dauer zu süßer Bock. 9/10/11/11/13/12","Köln (Cologne), GERMANY","Koelschtrinker"

4191,"2007-07-20",3.1,"Had this from tap at the same place as Mads Langtved. Clear brown color, short off-white head. Bocky aroma of hop, caramel malt, bit roasted, bit fruity. Bitter and malty taste. Decent balance, but not fantastic.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
4191,"2003-06-10",4.7,"This is perhaps on of the best beers I've ever tried. Tried it draught on a top of a hill neat the Michaelsberg kloster in Bamberg. Strong caramel notes dominationg this dark, thick beer. It reminds me a little of Belhaven's Wee Heavy even though it is a Scottish ale. The beers have the same complexity between the sweetness and the bitterness. This is how a beer should be. Unfortunately it is very rare, so I wont proberly get the chance of having this fantastic brew again. It is only produced for the church and St. Michaelsberg. I guess I have to live without it and miss it.","Copenhagen K, DENMARK","Mads Langtved"
