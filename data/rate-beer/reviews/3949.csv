3949,"2014-05-04",2.8,"Grabbed a bottle while walking dogs, its easier to get sake ticks than beer if I plan on drinking at home in my neighborhood. Pours a murky pale greenish. Nose is odd rice and sour citrus. Tastes of pears, lychee, lime soda, rice, and simple syrup. Sweet but not cloying. Overall just odd and not all that pleasant.","New York, USA","Jow"
3949,"2014-02-04",3.3,"Labeled as Trader Joe-sans Sparkling Sake - Tallahassee, Fl - Trader Joes - 300 ml bottle. Pours a slightly hazy pale light golden, slight bubble action. Aroma has some light pineapple accents,a brief floral hint - pleasant. Flavor has some pineapple-like fruitiness, a touch of mango, some boiled rice in the back ground. Crisp, smooth mouthfeel. Very easy drinking saké.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
3949,"2013-07-07",3.1,"Bottled. Poured like club soda with a quickly-fizzling white head and rising carbonation. The aroma picked up honeysuckle, pine needles, and sweeter rice.. touches of pepper around.. I really have no basis for comparison, but I enjoyed it. The flavor found honey, honeysuckle, and sweet rice at the core, with apple skins and peppery esters around.. picked up some odd, dank character along with overripe apple and a kiss of alcohol warmth on the finish. Lighter-bodied and fizzy on the palate.. transitions were alright.. more weird stuff came through as it warmed up.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
3949,"2012-04-13",3.6,"Trader Joe-sans Sparkling Sake: Pours a milky-clear, somewhat like coconut water. Thin, soda-like receding head. Fruity pineapple like aroma. A bit of alcohol seems to be coming off as well. Strange sensation. Really tastes like a fruit soda with a thicker texture and a starchy finish. That pineapple fruit flavor is all over the place. Light apple cider up front, and then becomes this thick and almost chalky. Has that weird finish that I dont like so much that I might have a name for if I were a little more versed on sake. I like it","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"
3949,"2011-11-23",3.5,"Trader Joe-Sans bottle. 
Pours looking like a sparkling lemonade, the sake has a little bit of a head at first which is interesting and nothing Ive ever seen before. 

The aroma is sweet and very floral, light hints of alcohol & mild fruitiness. 

The taste is fairly sweet and loaded with nice pear notes. There is a light tartness here and some light alcohol. All together its pretty sweet, but its very nice tasting... a tad drier and Id love it.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
3949,"2011-10-08",2.8,"Trader Joes label on this one.  Pours a fizzy clear white.  Aroma is weak... some faint booziness is about it.  Flavor is very sweet up front... a nice blast of pear and table sugar.  Alcohol and fizz take over down the home stretch.  Interesting, but not my thing.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"
3949,"2010-12-29",2.2,"Bottle as Trader Joe-Sans Sparkling Sake. This was unbearable. Aroma is a tape-like, ethyl acetate and wet cardboard aroma. Pours a murky, clouded rice water. Flavors are unbearably sweet, tainted with some ridiculous pale fruit flavoring, and the meager carbonation just makes this feel uneven and sickly. Would never buy again.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3949,"2010-12-27",3.6,"I had both the Ume No Yado and the Trader Joes Sparkling Sake side by side when tasting. Both poured a faint yellow with a small bubble white head that faded down pretty quickly. The TJs version was a tad bit darker yellow than what poured out of the Ume No Yado bottle. The UNY nose had a pretty sweet nose with notes of peach and pineapple. The TJs had a stronger peach presence than the UNY nose had. Flavor of the UMY was fairly sweet with a light note of peach and tropical fruity flavors but mostly was composed of flavors from the rice. TJs had a bit more tropical fruity sweetness with the rice flavors a bit more subdued. Body was light with lots of carbonation. I really did enjoy the sakes. The nose was much strong in both than the flavors but it was very well balanced in the sake. Trader Joes is supposed to be the same thing but there are subtle differences in the flavors, none of which would necessitate paying $3-5 more for the UNY.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"

3949,"2009-12-27",3.5,"Yeast and rice in the aroma, with a floral and tropical fruit undertone.  The body is hazy and very well carbonated, but no explosion when I opened it.  An interesting body, with a fruity character somewhere in between a sake and a sparkling wine.  Something similar to mangoes in the finish.  Nice.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
3949,"2009-03-13",3.1,"Rating from a 330ml bottle of Trader Joe-sans Sparkling Saké - It has a hazy, almost cloudy colorless body with a 1/3"" head, lazy bubbling, and plenty of beading.  It has ricey aroma mixed with sugary white grapes and mild melon.  The flavor is even fruitier and sweeter, but it is mildly pleasant in a soda-pop kind of a way.  Not something Id drink steadily, but not bad.","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
3949,"2009-01-27",2.8,"trader joes - norcross, ga.  a hazy white with a fizzy, quickly diminishing, white head.  lots of large bubbles in glass.  looks like sparkling white grape juice.  aroma is sweet and smells similar to tequila with more fruity notes.  flavor is slightly soured and quite sweet.  some nice fruity flavors.  light body.  i dont know much about sake but this was drinkable stuff.","","SSSteve"
3949,"2008-08-25",3.0,"Bottle: Misty/hazy white with a fuzzy appearance. The nose is sweeter with a grape and koji thing going on, still a decent sake nose actually, but you can tell it’s much lower alcohol so some of those ethereal melon notes are absent. The flavor is sweet with a light koji film and a bright citrus note in the tail. The mouthfeel can use some work, but the balance is about where it should be for this kind of sake, which can be challenging to get right. I’ve had a few better sparkling sakes, I’ve had many worse.Earlier Rating: 11/30/2007 Total Score: 3.4Bottle: Murky beige, nearly lychee like in appearance, small bubbles, lively carbonation and a nice retentive head. The nose is ripe, a bit of koji and peach. Light rice and carbonation, pleasant considering the ABV on this, it usually cant deliver the high end flavors and smells. The flavor is sweet and melonish, a tang in the tail, easy drinking but doesnt merit the price or the low alcohol. Mineral and chalk in the finish. Some banana. Better than most carbonated sakes.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3949,"2008-07-06",2.7,"Bottle from Trader Joes in Falls Churhc. Pours a hazy white, very fizzy. Aroma is sweet fruit, rice. Taste is sweet but drying. Melons, plum and rice fill out the palate. Smooth and tame, and too sweet for my liking. Still not bad for what I know of sparkling sakes.","Cochabamba, BOLIVIA","JonR888710"
3949,"2008-03-27",2.6,"Bottle chilled from TJs Cincy. Poured clear pale color with good legs and bubbles. Moderate melons and alcohol aroma. Light to medium body with a dry texture. Medium sweet melon and rice flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Smooth drinkable average sake. My expectations where not met.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3949,"2007-11-07",2.7,"Bottle opened with a sharp pop. Very light aroma of sweet fruit. Slightly hazy clear color (no color) with lots of fizzy bubbles but no head. Near medium body with creamy carbonation. Lightly sweet with green melon and citrus. Finish is near astringent. Crisp it is. The heat comes quickly from the body, but not in the mouth. Somewhat vinous in palate, though not to intimate grapiness. Certainly to be preferred to an American macro lager.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
3949,"2007-09-15",2.8,"Pale white with bubbles. Bits of grapefruit and other citrus. Light fizz. Sweet. Feels sweet on the tongue texturally.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
3949,"2007-08-06",4.2,"Really nice and creamy, though not as creamy or sweet as Hou Hou Shu Sparkling Sake.  Not worse, just different.  The bottle label looks a LOT like Star Rabbit but its blue instead of red, and theres a picture of a pink rabbit on it.  Moderately carbonated, this is about 1/3rd nigori creaminess combined with 2/3 the sweetness of a Hou Hou Shu.  Its a bit sweeter than a Ichinokura Himezen.  Very enjoyable.  About 6.5% abv.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
3949,"2007-06-03",3.6,"This gingo sake pours a translucent white color from a 330ml bottle. Medium sized white foamy head. Aroma is mildly sweet, some melon and a touch of fruit esters. A medium bodied sake. There are some melon flavors and some other fruity esters. A touch sweet, but crisp and clean. The carbonation is still fairly mild. Nice, I like this stuff. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is crisp and dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
3949,"2007-02-13",3.6,"330ml bottle from trader Joes; Nose of rice, kind of a casaba melon smell, and alcohol; Hazy ivory witha small paper white head; flavor has mild sweetness, some light fruity esters, and a mild alcohol finish. i like this one a lot better than the Trader Joes Gingo Sake.","Bakersfield, California, USA","IrishBoy"
