4534,"2016-04-19",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 19, 2016 Draught from Bryggeri Helsinki. Slight haze, pale gold, 6-8 srm. 2 fingers white head with solid retention. Light floral and pink pepper aromas, as well as light honey on the nose too. Medium body, medium high carbonation and strong bitterness for a pils. Lots of esters for a pilsner. For me it tastes more like an American pale: bitterness is too high and hop profile too. A bit of peppermint, grass, bubblegum/hard pink candy taste.

Known as ""Pedolintu"" among the Finnish beer connoisseurs. A bit hazy orange, steady white head, lots of lace. Very German - grassy, hayish aroma. Flavor is typical German too: very hayish hoppy.
