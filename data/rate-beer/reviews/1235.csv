Some hints of earthiness, even a touch of vinousness and borderline coffee-like roast. Very complex, very sniffable and with no sign whatsoever of the alcohol.Oh ya. Thats nice.

Sweet, yes, but not cloying in the least.  Black pepper, sourdough, vanilla, herbs, hay....the list goes on. Supple body from the malt, ample carbonation and no alcohol nor flaw noted. Damn.

1235,"2008-07-03",3.2,"UPDATED: SEP 5, 2008 Draught at Koutland, Pilsen.  Almost black with creamy head. Fruity raspberry aroma. Sweet and malty with full body lots of tar. Grainy malt with some butter. A powerful beer by Czech standards than finishes with milk chocolate and raisin. Pretty good, but nowhere near their pale beers in my book.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
1235,"2008-07-02",3.8,"Draft. A hazy amber beer with a thin brown head. The aroma is sweet with ntoes of caramel, alcohol, and herbs. The flavor is sweet malty with primary notes of caramel, but also notes of herbs and alcohol, leading to a dry bitter finish. Good balance.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"

1235,"2008-07-01",3.7,"At the Koutland in Plzen, supplied by omhper (thanks a lot!) What a way to finish a great Friday night. Extremely dark red-brown body, scant off white head. Malty and caramelly aroma. The taste is quite sweet and caramell, with some chocolate notes. A subtle, lovely porter and wow... never wouldve guessed it was 9%. Definitely a remarkable beer that I shouldve had again... the 3.7 seems a bit low.","Split / Zagreb, CROATIA","Marko"
1235,"2008-06-05",4.3,"Very dark brown colored body with an off-white head.  Nose of sweet bready raisins and toasted malt, along with toffee, wood and chocolate.  Flavor is creamy malt, toast, nuts, chocolate, dark plums and wood.  Rich, toasty, and full-bodied, with some drying toasty malts in the finish.  Very flavorful and dense, sweet but not overly sweet, finishing with a lingering rich toffee malt sweetness that soothes the palate.  Excellent stuff.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1235,"2008-05-06",3.6,"In short: Roasted chocolaty Baltic porter
How: Tap at Koutland, Pilsen, Czech Republic 
The look: Very dark ruby with a medium beige head
In long: Somewhat sweet beer with light fruity flavours showing up here and there among the roasted chocolaty malts.  Body is well malted and nourishing.  Its a given that a 4% Czech pilsners should be highly drinkable.  However to make a 9% porter so drinkable is almost insane.  With such easily drinkable beers this country may one day start drinking lots and lots of beer.  Oh, wait","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

1235,"2008-03-27",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Wholesome chocolate cakes envelop dried fruits aplenty, as alcohol heats up the finish with its politely bitter wooden hop acolytes. Whether these guys brew low-gravity pilseners or hefty Baltic Porters, they simply amaze me.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sturdy head of foam protects the blackened dark brown.
-Carbonation is comfortable and suits the full body perfectly. Come to think of it, whether its a 3.5% abv Svetlé Vycepni or a 9% abv Baltic Porter, carbonation is nearly always perfectly calculated in Czechia.
-As Ernest says, it is very difficult to switch gears to a Baltic Porter after having had so many superb Pilseners at Koutland (and in the Czech Republic in general), but with a little effort Im sure you can do it.
-The dessert-like fruitiness is redolent of cherries and raisins.

1235,"2008-01-27",4.0,"Draught, Koutland/Plzen.

Head is mostly lasting.
Body is dark brown.

Aroma is moderately malty (bread, molasses, chocolate), lightly hoppy (herbs), trace yeast (dough), with notes of plum, date, anise.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately bitter.

Medium to full body, velvety/creamy texture, lively/soft carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

Rich with considerable depth.  At the time it was a little difficult to switch gears to a heavy dark beer after getting so used to the 5% or so pale lagers, but nice stuff indeed.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

1235,"2007-06-12",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 11, 2008 Growler. [thank you so much motelpogo]. Very excited to see this come in a growler all the way from the Czech Republic. It pops with much vigour, and pours a deep nutty brown with a small beige head. Aroma has nuts, caramel, oak, some herbal tones, I cant really pinpoint. Quite full bodied, but still lively - so I wont call it oily. Flavour is stunning! There are tones of caramel, hazelnuts, lots of wood, a definite hoppyness. It balances a liveliness with a stunning array of flavours. Very nice heavy bitter finish that are mixed with a clear vinious tone. Really great - and that is from a growler that has been 10 days in the mail!. 8/4/10/4/18 = 4.4
Tap @ Koutland, Plzen.
Pours deep, deep mahogany with a super, staying, creamy, beige/cappucino head. Aroma is softly tart, light coffee, sweet liqourice, pleasant roastiness and good hoppiness. Super creamy mouthfeel. Flavour is wonderfully roasted, sweet, light chocolate and a good raisin-like tartness. Truly wonderful. 8/5/9/5/16 = 4.3","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"

1235,"2007-02-02",4.7,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2007 on tap at u kodovky in plzen. holy guacashit, this is immense. black and foreboding with a touch of mahogany around the edges of the glass. massive lingering head with huge bubbles. aroma of moss, chocolate cake mix, lotsa grassy saaz, sour cream. very buttery texture, fresh flavours of brownies, vanilla, coffee liqueur, cake batter, brandy butter and a saazed out, bitter finish with some after-dinner mint quality. about time there was a great strong, dark, czech beer - the key seems to be the shitload of saaz and extra dark malt, this is never sticky, even after a few half litre glasses and has the drinkablility of a quality czech dark like regent tmavy. a difficult beer to classify - labelled simply as 18 degree christmas dark but somewhere in between a baltic porter and dunkler bock, ive never tried anything like this, hope it doesnt run out too soon. 

re-rate: well, ive tasted this a few more times in the past week and have reclassified it as a baltic porter instead of dunkler bock. truth be told, it resembles an imperial stout more than anything else but im pretty sure it must be a lager. the saaz character has started to fade ever so slightly (or my taste buds have become more attuned to this beer) but the texture keeps getting more luscious. it took them about 5 minutes to pull a small glass of this today, i hope its not running out...","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
