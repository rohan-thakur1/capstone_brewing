4507,"2012-05-14",3.4,"In short: A straightforward sweet dessert amber ale
How: Tap at at Hivernale Des Brasseurs 2012
The look: Cloudy dark amber body topped by an off-white ring of foam
In long: Nose is straightforward caramel with light notes of maple syrup and a tiny bit of fusel/nail polish.  Taste is luscious caramel, sweet pie crust, sugary maple syrup.  There was a light fruitiness reminiscent of concentrate apple juice.  But overall the main note I took from this beer is that it tasted like mini maple cones (a quebec thing, popular with kids with retards like me).  Supposedly going to this beer festival drinking big winter warmer beers wasnt the best thing to do for me, but surely there has to be an easier solution to cure my alcoholism than to not drink beer all the time.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4507,"2012-04-18",3.6,"Sample from tap at Winter Warmer 2012.
Appearance : Clear amber with small foamy white head.

Aroma : Resinous hops with notes of toffee, anise and spices. Nice fruits.

Taste : Sweet caramel with toffee and spices. Quite malty with light alcohol. Finish malty with toffee and spices. Fairly persistent finish. Notes of raisins.

Overall : Nice rich finish and persistent finish. Nice caramel. Alcohol fairly well hidden. Very well made, nothing bad to say but just not really my thing.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

4507,"2012-03-28",3.6,"On tap at Winter Warmer: Poured an amber color beer with a small foamy head. Aroma of sweet malt notes with light warming alcohol. Taste is a unique mix between some grainy notes with some caramelized malt with light maple notes also being perceptible. Body was about average with medium carbonation and light warming alcohol notes were perceptible. A somewhat unique creation that I wouldnt mind trying again in a different setting.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

4507,"2012-03-03",3.4,"A dark reddish brown ale with a thin lacing off white head. In aroma, a smooth sweet malt with chalky notes, light herbal notes. In mouth, a sweet candy sugar with light mineral notes, a bit of licorice, rather boring. On tap at Montreal Winter Warmer, Feb. 25 2012.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
4507,"2012-02-27",3.8,"Drank at the 2012 Winter Warmer Montreal, on February 25. Coppery red, small head. Woody aroma of chocolate, sweet barley. Barley taste and strong alcoholic, fruity notes of wood, aftertaste of single malt scotch. A good experiment to do a frozen scotch ale!","Boisbriand, Quebec, CANADA","Quevillon"
4507,"2012-02-25",3.6,"on tap @ Winter Warmer Montreal 2012. Dark ruby with a thin creamy off white head. Big sweet nose of maple sugar and toffee. Full bodied, very sweet, all on the caramel flavors, butterscotch and very sticky finale. Nice for the style, but vey hard to drink more than a sampler of this one. A bit one-dimensionnal.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","lefossoyeur"
4507,"2011-04-17",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Silky and refined, this Iced Maple Scotch Ale balances crème brûlée and maple syrup flavors alongside subtle fruitiness and alcohol warmth. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam crowns the dark ruby.
-This may not be a super complex strong brew, but its execution is impeccable and its smooth body makes for effortlessly sipping.
-Like in most Siboire strong brews, the body is never heavy.
-Alcohol does not take a lot of room in the finish, which is appreciated.
-The pairing with a square of creamy sucre à la crème was exquisite.

On tap at the brewpub.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
