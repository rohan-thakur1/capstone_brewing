3623,"2017-02-20",4.4,"Appearance: Slightly hazy orange body with a nice head (1-2 fingers) that lasts and lots of lacing on the glass.

Smell: Even as she poured it, its all hops all the way. Granted, they are probably not as strong as last week. The waitress said the whole place smelled of hops when it was made. Not too bitter with a healthy dose of a floral and herbal aroma mixed with some mango.

Taste: Man is it fresh! It has a week on it but you wouldnt know it by tasting it. Some grapefruit but the main act is the mango that is quite delicious. A good bitterness that isnt aggressive and lasts long after the sip.

Mouthfeel: Smooth and effervescent with good carbonation. Solid body and very well balanced.

In mouth, a smooth hoppy ale with light grapefruits, biscuitty malts, quite nice (compared to other Qc Harvest Ales), medium bodied.

3623,"2010-10-22",3.2,"Une belle pinte style américain sur place. Bière dorée avec des reflets orangées. Belle mousse épaisse. Les houblons transcendent le nez avec en plus une légère sucrositée perceptible. En bouche la bière a une finale sucrée, manque datténuation. Elle goûte le houblon frais, un peu herbeux et aussi les malt caramel. Agréable. 6/10","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","rodenbach99"

3623,"2010-10-10",3.0,"Drank on tap (20 oz), at their brepub, on 10-10-10. Honey red, thin head. Very light hop aroma, slightly bitter. Green hop taste, light and dry, notes of vegetation aftertaste and not much bitterness. I heard that the first brew was better, but I cant get used to this style!","Boisbriand, Quebec, CANADA","Quevillon"
3623,"2010-10-08",3.7,"Verre de 10 oz, à la brasserie. Arômes très frais de houblon herbacé et de céréales légèrement caramélisées. Robe dun orange assez foncé et trouble, peu de mousse et effervescence moyenne. En bouche, le houblon présente un côté très frais, avec des notes inusitées de menthol et de chlorophylle. La bière est relativement mince en bouche, présentant de légères céréales caramélisées et grillées. Finale légèrement amère et délicate. Très facile à boire et la signature du houblon frais est vraiment originale.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MJGG"
3623,"2009-10-18",3.9,"In short: A uber-hoppy grassy/herbal/floral very sharp and very bitter beer of some kind.  Intense, different and pretty damn good.
How: Tap at brewpub, very fresh the first day it was tapped
The look: Cloudy golden orange body topped by a small off-white head
In long: First, the concept of the beer is freshness.  Made using local hops on the same day they were harvested.  On to the beer: Nose is very grassy hoppy, like smelling hops and grass from very very close, to the point of having some stuck in your nostrils.  Taste was very intense.  With the concept of the beer I expected a soft juicy grassy bitter.  Not the case.  I dont know how this happened but this turned out as a very sharp bitter beer commanding respect.  Huge grass juice flavour.  Sucking on a hop pelett.  Very grassy, herbal, floral.  Bitter grapefruit with grapefruit acidicty.  Bitter orange peels.  Some kind of dryness that felt like yellow grass burnt by the sun.  Some kiwis.  Very sharp grassy and grapefruity astringency while the bitterness builds up like a crescendo.  Every sips seem more bitter than the previous one.  Very long finish.  First half of my pint went down very quickly but I had to slow down for the second half to give my palette a little break.  Too intense for a session beer.  I know of people who had it with a few days of age and it was described to as very different than what I experienced mega-fresh the day of its release.  This is not a traditional Bitter.  We are in America.  When the British call a beer a Bitter, it is really not that bitter.  When they talk about a hot British, she is really not that hot.  When they talk about nice British weather, it is really not that nice.  Only when they talk about a bad British meal you can be certain it is really bad.  Really really bad.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
3623,"2009-09-30",4.1,"My Bottom Line:
This Harvest Ales engaging orangey, spicy and resinous hop perfume attracts the taster into a quenching flavor profile balanced by judiciously caramelized cereals. A lenient hop bitterness then concludes each sip, offering citrusy, earthy and leafy melodies.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam paints captivating circles of lacing atop the glowing golden amber as the pint is downed.
-Carbonation is smooth and the body is very supple, making for optimal drinkability.
-If more Amber Ales were of this ilk, this colour/style would be more enticing to craft beer lovers.
-This is not unlike Swan Lakes Amber Ale...
-The 30 IBUs are perfect in this case. I just love the idea of a very aromatic brew becoming levelled and diplomatic once tasted. Who says a nicely dry-hopped beer has to be intense in the flavor profile?
-I dont see this as an English Bitter per say, but thats whats written on the menu. That being said, it is not to any specific style that I know of.
