1842,"2017-05-09",2.9,"Der Antrunk ist malzig süss, super würzig. Danach schmeckt man deutlich den Alkohol raus, der aber von schönen Hopfennoten begleitet wird. Ein öliges vollmundiges und zugleich süffiges Bier.","Bavaria, GERMANY","beerstar88"
1842,"2017-01-20",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
This refined Heller Bock juxtaposes apricot fruitiness, honeyed sugars and white pepper-like spiciness in an agile mouthfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the misty gold.
-Carbonation is quite bubbly, making you forget about the higher alcohol percentage.
-Malt flavors are well defined.
-This is more complex than the typical Heller Bock relying on pilsner malt.

1842,"2015-03-24",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2015 Gravity barrel at the FrankenBierFest in Rome. Lightly hazed rich brown body with a fine and lasting white head. Malty aroma suggests nutty pastries and just-baked bread, hops are quietly herbal and citric / orange-like, hoppier than most Franconian bock which I find is to be expected from Knoblach. Its medium-full bodied, superbly rich and brimming with melanoidins, its toasty and sweet and savory and lightly bitter and it all maintains from beginning to end... the balance and expression here is just jaw dropping. Carbonation is soft and fine, providing a plump cushion on which to deliver the snappy, clean, well-lagered malt. Both this and the Ungspunds Lagerbier were in absolutely stunning shape at the Rome festival, perhaps the best Ive ever had from Knoblach after all of my visits to the brewery in Schammelsdorf, and at the fest we had the added bonus of trying so many Francoanian lagers next to each other, a task which is near impossible in Franconia itself. Stunning lager.Earlier Rating: 11/29/2013 Total Score: 4.2Draft at the brewery in Schammelsdorf. Burnt orange colored body with a fine white head.

1842,"2014-08-22",3.2,"Draft at the brewpub in Nov. 2013: Burnished golden. Nice aroma of flowers, toasted bread, apricot, and honey-drizzled nuts (Munich). Hint of burnt rubber, doughy yeast, and herbal hops. Soft carbonation is on the loose side. Doughy yeast astringency precedes a very soft and clean marmalade-slathered toasted bread foundation. Plentiful hay-dust textures cause the mouth to water as they deepen the complexity and soak up the sugars. Understated kiss of vibrant Hallertau. Alcohol is very well concealed, although the body is somewhat weighed down by a semi-tacky apricot fruitiness and doughy yeastiness. Finishes heftily malty with cakey notes capped by a delayed spicy-herbal firmness which dries things out some, although the fruity esters and sugars ultimately prevail. A tad muddled, yeasty, doughy for my tastes. As much as I like to see fruity esters in my heller bock, the fruitiness overexerts itself and ends up hampering the cleanliness. Solid malt depth and aroma, though, plus it was lots of fun watching Mike merrily slug a couple half-liter glasses right down the gullet.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

1842,"2011-06-12",3.9,"Milder Antrunk, etwas würzig, getreidig, SEHR weich. Im Mittelteil weiter eher mild, angenehm würzig, weich, erfrischend, sehr untypisch für einen Bock. Erst im Abgang wird das Bier kräftiger, das Brauwasser scheint aber auch hier seine Weichheit zu bestätigen und die Malzigkeit stark einzugrenzen. Gute Balance zwischen Süffigkeit und Intensität, getreidig-frtischer Abgang mit erstmals starker und malziger Gewürznote. Ein sehr eigenes Bier und mit Sicherheit der süffigste Bock den ich bisher getrunken habe.
