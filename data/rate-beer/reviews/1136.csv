Pours a very saturated, burgundy red color, with a soon disappating, fizzy head. 

Exhibit a fantastic smelling nose, with a very pronounced raspberry presence, blending perfectly into the tart acidity of the beer, establishing a reminiscence of young berries and young, fermented wine. Barnyard funk mingles together with prickly raspberry stones, tied together by a sweet, fruity undertone, exhibiting a gentle depth to the aromas. 

Has a medium carbonation and a very soft mouthfeel, with raspberry at every stage of drinking.

Tastes of unripe raspberries right from the beginning, wrapped up in leaves, moldy earth and tart funk - wild berries on an abandoned road during rain. This changes, as an earthy sweetness adds to the raspberries spending them a ripe note, including prickly, still sour stones. This fruity sweetness then stays on par with the bitterness on the palate till the finish, with the berries exhibiting a dusty earth note anong ripened, slightly fermented raspberry pulp, leaving behind a slick sourness.

The balance between ripe and young, sour raspberries, finding their quintessence in between, makes this beer noteworthy, featuring a lot of subtle Barnyard nuances.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1136,"2014-10-11",4.7,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2017 Vintage 2003 - not much to say besides: Near perfect Cantillon. Not overwhelmingly framboise-smelling, but still very distinct. Dry. Dry. Dry. Sour. Sour. Sour. Fruits. Incredible. 4.9

Vintage 2003, again (at Zwanze 15). No residual sweetness at all. Not a single sugar molecule. Extreme fruitiness and long fruity finish and aftertaste. Extreme stuff, amazing stuff. A bit foamy carbonation.

Vintage 2009 shared at Zwanze 16. Similar in character,  quite some almonds as well. Mouth-puckering and very ""minty"" funky. Slightly sulphuric in the back. I might have overrated this one earlier ^^

Vintage 2013, finally a younger one! Shared with anstei at the source. So much funk and raspberry jam, as were used to. Taste is sour, raspberries still there, but lots of sourness. High carbonation. This is already quite aggressive, but the bugs haven?t killed *every* sugar molecule yet. I have to adjust my first rating, I was just too inexperienced back then. 10-4-10-4-18

Vintage 2013 again, so many thanks to Robbie from Tribaun! Jammier, dry, not too sour yet. Better than the one I?ve had at Cantillon. Amazing, a real masterpiece.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","SinH4"

Juicy, jammy raspberry explosion on the palate. Fruity, tart, sour, & funky with a good bit of wood, lacto yeast, horsey funk, & mild sweat. Light acidity, some lemon flesh, & a sharp, finishing sourness. Puckering. A touch of yogurt in the back-end, finishing dry with lingering raspberry skins & soured wood.

This shows huge almost undrinkable acidity in older renditions (2003) and a more modest approach in later batches up to current release, which as of last sampling in late 2013 was showing a musty barnyard note and very little of the acidity the early 2000s batches exhibit.

Thanks to Brandon and Emily for bringing this out from Paris!

Pours a simply gorgeous razzy red. Really lovely cherry blossom caps this one. Nose carries more funk than Id anticipated, really the earthy aspect of Cantillons arsenal. The raspberries come through acidic and sharp with hints of vinous shreds. Flavor carries surprising balance. The tartness and buxelles funk are soo well balanced with generous bounties of raspberries. The whole thing comes together and reminds me of a freshly picked raspberry during the high sun of an August day mixed with the grit of a solid days hike. A little full bodied with reserved carbonation accentuated the generous fruit endowment for the beer. Finish made me want another sip of the beer, and a gulp of ice cold water. Really a step up from the Rose, and I appreciate the attention to detail here.

1136,"2013-10-08",3.8,"75cl bottle. Beautiful red with medium head that dissipates rather quick. 
NOSE : strong fruit aromas of cherry, raspberry, apple, grapes. Wood and tart notes. It does remind that this lambic was maturated in wine barrels.
SIP : oily texture with low carbonation. The body is thicker then water and we see the sparkling in it. Almost like candy sweetness with a very pronounced sour fruit flavors. The sourness is not out of balance, yet it lasts long. Fresh aromas and flavors are astonishing giving the fact that this lambic is 3 years old. Dry wood and apple seed bitter notes in the aftertaste. 
OVERALL : again Im not a big fan of Lambic. This one seams well balanced and refreshing. Quite complex yet its straight forward. Even a complete stranger to whisky knows when he drinks a good whysky. This lambic gives that impression.","Warszawa, POLAND","Swaroga"

S - Smells of intense basement must and barnyard funk and not much else. Not a ton of fresh fruit which is a bit surprising with such a fresh bottle but it is still enjoyable.


T - Starts off with the strong must and funk combo that never really fades away. The raspberries come through a little more here but they are still more muted than I was expecting. Finish is still pretty musty with some lingering tartness. Not overly sour like some of the aged bottles I have had, but not as bright with the fruit either.


M - Medium-Light body with moderately high carbonation. The spritzy feel propels the musty, tart flavors across the palate. 


O - My first time having this one fresh and it was interesting. I was expecting a lot more fruit than I got from it, mostly the trademark Cantillon musty funk combo but that is fine as well. Probably my least favorite of the three Lou Pepes but still a beer worth seeking out.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

My nose turns inside out with each sniff. Raspberry purée, lots of sharp sour/tart funkiness, slight oak. Surprised how well the fruit notes have held up after all these years. An utter onslaught of raspberries, sour, and funk. Light, fizzy carbonation, super dry finish.

A terrific offering from a fabulous brewery.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

3.5 A: Fairly clear plum colored first pour. Three fingers of fizzy pink head that falls quickly and leaves no lacing.

4.5 S: Raspberry is huge in this. Tart, sweet, and powerful. Like any good Cantillon fruit, this is full of acid, but low on funk. Tons of lactic acid with a mild to moderate acetic component. Underneath there is a light musty basement type funk.

4.0 T: Moderately sour with a good tart pucker factor. Raspberry and tangy lactic acid galore. Surprisingly, theres a good bit of funk in there as well. Musty basement, rotting wood, and a mild cheesiness. Sharp, tart raspberry finish. 

3.0 M: The mouthfeel is kinda dull. Lighter medium body. The carbonation is on the lower end for the style, but good enough. The problem is that it isnt very spritzy. Creaminess is lacking as well. This sits rather dead on the tongue.

4.0 D: Tasty framboise. A bit hard to justify the price, but good for a special occasion, like a Pens playoff game.

1136,"2012-03-16",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2014 Ok, one of my last final rates before I retire and turn professional with my current beer project. As Cantillon has been such a remarkable and shamefully ignored brand I feel I should include them in my final rates

On the eye this beer is extremely pleasant. Extremely red on the side but if you hold it up to the light there is a lovely sunbeam golden red colour which is really stunning. it is very hazy and dark but the colour is still gorgeous.

The aroma is raspberries; perfume, white wine grapes and very faint lemons. The taste is plenty of strawberries, a sweet and ripe texture, the acidic levels is quite sharp and dry, very tarty but not too aggressive. The palate is sticky and almost lemon-tart like but very drinkable and an interesting taste of maybe elderflower combined with the raspberries. Really complex and challenging to describe.

The sourness sticks to your mouth for quite some considerable time afterwords and this is no complaint. The finish is incredibly long; vinegary and woody. This beer is a bottle from 2008 and has evened out well. A classic lambic. Bought from Utobeer in Borough Market, London.","Essex, ENGLAND","tdtm82"
1136,"2012-03-12",4.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 9/26/2011.  2006 Vintage. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tasting glass.

The cloudy color is instantly recognizable as the only color raspberries can be. A nice soft white froth gently recedes to a ring around the edge along with a few wisps of lace.

The raspberry in the aroma is quite sour. There are some light malt notes, and some good funk in there, but at this point it is mostly sour.

The raspberry flavor in this beer is just brilliant. With five or so years in the bottle, the flavor has become balanced between tart and funky. 

I suspect that over time the body has dried out and lightened up a bit as the beer continued to develop. At this stage the body is on the light side of medium, with medium strength fizzy carbonation. Somewhat acidic, but not overly so. 

I am a sucker for good raspberry sours, and this is probably my favorite one at this point. Simply fantastic, I would like to always have this in my fridge, and my future beer purchases will probably reflect that desire.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Look: White-raspberry head, fiery blood-orange/ruby grapefruit color
Smell: Sweet, jammy raspberry underscored by a well-integrated funky note. Very inviting.
Taste: Significantly more sour than the regular framboise, but equally matched by a robust raspberry flavor. Smelled like it would be sweetish, but the flavor is definitely full-on sour. Finishes dry, tangy and tart, with a hint of the jam returning at the end to counter the sour flavor.
Mouthfeel: The carbonation seems somewhat subdued after several years of aging, but still enough to keep the beer from being too cloying.

1136,"2011-07-23",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 24, 2011 Appearance:  One of the few beers where looks really count.  Transparent, intense and vivid red raspberry and red rose.

Aroma:  Dry, tart red raspberry & some tart cherry. Floral and especially medicinal aromas.

Taste:  Tart, dry red raspberry, bitter medicinal/quinine flavors, yeast, and straw.  Finishes with a resurgence of tart dry red raspberry, medicinal and and rose hip tea flavors.  

Comment:  2008 Vintage.  Complex, but not an easy drinker.  This must be brilliant with the right food and certainly challenges the palate.  The low alcohol and acidity make it a relatively refreshing choice for summer, though I cant see a wine getting away with this much tartness.  Still, not as sour as the Rose de Gambrinus and without the oxidized notes that I experienced with that lambic..

Day 2:  

Aroma:  Red raspberry descends into a dry desert underworld of dusty straw, dried mold and a dash of rodent pee before triumphantly rising past metallic and medicinal aromas to finish with red berries and flowers.  Thats one crazy ride.

Flavor:  Medicinal and metallic notes that I overlooked yesterday, tart red raspberry merges with white grapefruit plus bitter grapefruit rind and these carryover into the finish which also shows some yeast and straw.

Good intensity from the mid-palate through a long finish.  Also, very fine carbonation.  Although this is an acquired taste, I could see giving this a 4.5 or 4.6 because it is well-made and complex.","Kobe, JAPAN","Wombata"

Aroma is sour and tart with some acetic notes and strong raspberry character. One of the best smelling beers Ive ever had. Classic Cantillon smell.

Beer is very tart and not as acetic as I thought it was going to be, this is probably a good thing but the acetic character would likely grow over time slightly. There is nice raspberry flavors and good fruit tartness at the back. Some lactic notes and a slightly tannic quality overall as well. Nice carbonation in the mouth and highly drinkable. This could be one of my favorite Cantillons so far.

1136,"2011-03-24",4.4,"2005 vintage from the bottle into a champagne glass.

This lambic pours a medium pink/violet with about 2 inches of light pink head. The retention is poor as it falls within a minute. The lacing is light and watery. 

The aroma is wonderful. There is the great funky horse blanket similar to what you get with the Saint Lamvinus, but this is far superior to the SL because it rewards you with great notes of sweet raspberries to balance out the tart.

The taste is also equally balanced rewarding the drinker with tartness and just enough sweetnes that a true lambic follower is looking for to enhance the drinkability. The first sip is lightly sweet with a raspberries and finishes with lots of sourness. 

The mouthfeel is heavy and full and coats your mouth and makes you pucker.

Because this is so balanced its exceedingly drinkable for something so tart.

A-pours a bright ruby red color with an extremely light pink colored bubbly head.

S-the nose has a hint of earthy mushroom funk to it, light sweeter oak presence, the fruits are rather bright and the raspberry is seedy and fresh, it has a hint of tartness.

T-the taste is slightly muted in comparison to the nose.  the acidity picks up in the finish and detracts from the brightness of the fresh raspberries.  the funk is up front and well integrated with a note of oak and earthy flavors.  the rapberry in back starts sweet but the acidity really presents a problem for it to push through.

M-medium bodied beer with a slightly syrupy feel to it and high carbonation with a very dry finish.

D-put up against many other lambics and sour raspberry ales, the acidity of some of these, including this one, take away from the juicy fruit flavors you get in the nose.  the integration is done very well but this would probably be best drank fresh.

Who needs fresh fruit when you have Lou Pepe Framboise? The raspberry character is so marked you can feel the drupelets on your tongue. Something in the acid has kept them in stasis.

Its sour enough to remind you of a vinaigrette. A funky, oaky vinaigrette. How many vitamins are still present in this liquid? Is it feasible to make this my primary source of dietary fiber? These are the questions I ask myself.

Tons of tart raspberries right as it enters your mouth, then smooths out and transitions into a bone dry finish. Raspberry, lemon, and orange rind on the finish, which also tastes a little salty.

S: The raspberries have certainly begun to fade, but they are still very noticeable. The fruit provides a slight sweetness to the nose which nicely offsets the very acidic and tart aromas.

T: This beer is extremely acidic and doesnt have quite the fruitiness left to balance this out (but this is what you expect from Cantillon). The oak is not all that present, but there is certainly a dryness from both the wood and the fruit.

M: Due to the lack of carbonation, the beer is quite slick and smooth on the palate. The high acidity and overall tannic quality of the beer gives a very dry finish.

Ruby red with a small pink head that leaves some lacings.

The smell is a bit mild with notes of raspberries, grass and mild funky notes. Not a whole lot of acidity.

The taste is tart with muted but clean raspberry flavors. Somewhat acidic. Notes of grass and raspberry seeds, and funky notes of mud and hey. Wood. The finish has a mild grassy bitterness to it and notes of minerals and dry raspberry notes.

Surprisingly full body (still moderate though) with very sparkling carbonation.

A good one. Very drinkable. However, it seems to lack complexity and is slightly to clean in character. It seems ""young"", which isnt that weird since this bottle was only a couple of months old. Would probably be way better in a year or so.

2006 Vintage (Nov 2009 3.7)
I really like the fact this is a single vintage blend. Beer needs more of these nuances to compete with fine wine. Im used to some pretty rough and intense lambics from Cantillon but this is relatively soft and mild. Looks awesome - a glowing raspberry red. Pretty raspberry fruits on the nose, quity fruity. Tart, lean , salty and sour very early to taste. The raspberry fruit lurks right through the palate but never becomes obviously. A subtle yet complex touch. Some acid burn as well, but of course this is to be expected. Wont be a super long keeper but I would defininately like to see again in 3 years.","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"

Thanks to buffalohead for sharing a 2005 vintage of this at a tasting.  Even after a dozen other beers the Cantillon goodness shone through.  This made it the clear winner of the night and one that reminds me just how great Cantillon beers can be.  If they didnt cost $20+ each I would certainly be drinking them more often.

Aroma / Appearance - Tart and strong with raspberries as the key player the sourness dominates from the start.  The body is a wonderful glowing red with light pink head.  Fluid it crawls around the glass.

Flavor / Palate - Sharp raspberries break through the dull fatigue of a dozen IPAs and stouts.  Like fresh cherry pie the acid refreshed and reawakens the palate.  Making it sit up and beg for more it was a sad time when this bottle finally kicked.  I look forward to a week in Belgium and the chance to some day try a whole raft of these without the high cost associated with buying them stateside.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1136,"2009-10-29",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2010 Vintage 2008 with craftycarl21 and WLG423. Deep pink hued garnet with a small light pink head. Aroma is bursting with fresh pureed raspberry, a light acidic funk, a light oak note, and tart over ripe nectar. Flavor is suitability tart and wholly rude. Tart raspberry, wood, and a massively sour funk kick you right in the Jimmie. A mild acetic acid peeps in as well to allow for a nice warming on the way down. Balance of flavors is superb: sour kick, raspberry tartness, funk and wood all combine to make for quite the quaff. Palate is mildly effervescent, slippery, smacking, and finished quite dry. Absolutely incredible. Vintage 2007 Re-rate. Pours a beautiful ruby-garnet with a lively pink head that expediantly dissipates with an audibly lively fizz. What is left is a thin pink hued veneer that sticks to the edges of the glass, with numerous tiny bubbles rising up from various nucleation points. The aroma is powerful and pronounced in an nasal burning, Cantillon-typical rude fashion. I love it. Raspberry puree abounds, as does pear and apple cider. These cider notes intermingles with the slightest acetic acid note to make for a mild vinegar quality. The BJCP says this acetic acid profile is undesirable, and I think theyre full of shit. Gratuitous earth, funk, farm manure, and oak are all decidedly prevalent. The first sip brings about the laceratively rude qualities Ive come to love from Cantillon: Huge funk and puckering sourness is only slightly tamed by raspberry and further cider notes. A slight tannic oak melds into a swirling torrent of goat and horse balls- a desirable quality indeed. The palate is incredible for the style: a nice full weight sits on the tongue, complemented nicely by a pillowy effervescence. The mouthfeel is slippery as the quaff takes place, and finishes bone dry and super attenuated. Perhaps the best framboise in my book- second only to Hommage- but I guess that a hybrid would be cheating...","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"

As expected, a big acid component on the palate straight up, bit more balanced with the fruit this time around. Mouthfilling texture, lively carbonation, very lengthy yet dry.
Delicious fruits on the body; raspberry and strawberry jam, redcurrant jelly, vinous plum and blackberry, grapefruit and lemon cuts through leading onto vinegar and citric acidity. Hay and subtle horse towards the finish. Ends with big lingering acid, tannic and oaky.
Would have to put this on par with the best fruit lambics im yet to try. Certainly the better of the raspberry(framboise) ive come across.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

Flavor was sweet and tart grapefruit-raspberry, sweet citrus around the sides of the tongue, tart strawberry fructose, raw wheat, subtle funky yeast, and a strong tart finish.

1136,"2009-01-15",3.9,"2001 vintage from Friar Tucks in Savoy, IL. Pours amber with some pale pink hues and an off white head, spotty lacing. Lacto/Brett aroma that comes across with notes of vinegar, mildew, lemon, and hay- not inviting but not offensive either. Typical Belgian lambic texture and mouthfeel, which is soft with a fine effervescence. First sip just socks you with a huge mouth puckering sourness. Its almost too intense for me at first, but like jumping in cold pool, you get used to it after awhile. Raspberry is merely a nuance with the age on this and the bugs taking over. There is some slight acetic (vinegar) notes, but it sort of adds to the complexity. Finish is musty, moderately acidic and somewhat dry. A good beer for its style, but just a bit too sour for my personal tastes.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"

1136,"2008-12-23",4.1,"2003 bottle, aged five years.  The lightly hazy, pinkish-red body shows a small, swirly, off-white film at the surface.  Very little spotty lacing marks the glass.  The beautiful nose shows notes of both fresh, ripe, semi-sweet raspberries and dry, aged, tart ones.  Mildly musty farmhouse yeast notes are accompanied by dry French oak and ample citric acidity.  Flavors show more of the same, an excellent balance between sweet and tart raspberries on full display.  There is citric intensity, along with dry, dusty, tannic elements, but the soft oak and subtle fruity sweetness are enough to smooth things out nicely.  Medium bodied and dry, the sourness really hints the glands in the back of the throat on the way down.  This is a masterful beer, and it is probably the best framboise lambic I have had to date.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

The aroma is a burst of fruit, though slightly artificial  like fruit roll-ups. Theres a great tartness showing through, but on the whole its very sweet. The flavor brings the tartness to the forefront, making the fruit seem far less artificial. Like not-quite-ripe raspberries were crushed in a glass  Ive never had a beer that tasted so much like real fruit. Just enough sweetness to offset the tart raspberries.

1136,"2008-09-10",4.2,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle, vintage 2001.  Thanks Joe!  Fleshy, muddy, rusty red hue.  Seedy acerbic raspberry aroma; alternately soft on stems and musty grass, and violent, on peppery funk; still dominant in that raw, sharp wooden acid character; rustic and rough.

Cutting, fresh raspberry flavor is sharply imbued with funk and minerals, though the fruit still seems impressively lively and evocative; the minerals, firey woods and acetic acids provide wildness and puckering punch never shrinking back, but naturally rich tartness of the fruit is what’s really the centerpiece, and it’s a beautiful, visceral experience.  The vinegar acidity and puckering wooden heat grows more punchy mid-palate.

Still, the body is sumptuous and full, more diverse and more versatile than other high-acid examples; a typical, flaming acidic finish showing lengthy raspberry flesh and seeds; not immensely dry, but satisfying.  The best non-gueze I’ve had from Cantillon; a clean, refreshing example that still has all the outrageousness you could ask for from a lambic.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

The aroma is obviously fruity, but there is also a nice tart tickle that hits the back of the nostrils.

1136,"2007-08-09",4.0,"About a 4oz pour from a 750ml bottle
2004 vintage, consumed Aug, 2007 (3 years cellared)
The bright shiny ruby pink body sits about 60-80% opaque in my glass, with only a small white ring on top that pretends to be a head.  That’s fine, though, and expected.  The rich and deep ruby red hue in the center of the glass loses it’s luminocity as the depth thins near the sides of the glass, which is colored only a soft whitish-pink.  Nose is primarily candied raspberries, doesn’t really have much seed/hair/stem flavors from the fruit, only a slightly sweet fruit scent.  I don’t want to use the term sugary because that would imply a high level of sweetness, and the nose is not very sweet at all, but the raspberry quality is sweet and as much as it pains me to say - underdeveloped, as well.  Only 3 years in the bottle, though, so that’s expected.  You really need these things aged at least 5-6 years for the trademark Cantillon caustic sourness to develop.  Still, I can’t complain too much, because it’s Cantillon and they do gueuze like noone else.  The flavor is interesting, beginning as a creamed, candied raspberry flavor, more of a sugar sweetness than a true fruit sweetness, and over the middle it quickly turns silky smooth and numbing, then quickly turns rough and tingly, even pasty, with some light acetone flavors showing up near the back, then a salty bite at the back of the mouth.  The finish actually does have some seed/hair/stem, moderate tartness, and of course a proper corrosive sourness.  I will need to either find a 1999 or 2002, or put some of this 2004 away for a few more years to rerate.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

1136,"2006-08-17",4.1,"Beautiful in its frosted Bordeaux robe and ephemeral rosy white crown, theres no doubt youre in the presence of a majestic beer. Rich red fruits are vibrant in the nose, raspberries of course are escorted by cherries, wild strawberries and grapes. Bubble gum and brown sugar conjointly add a sweet dimension to the continually accreting complexity. A metallic resonance appears with time, followed by buttered toast, café au lait, watermelon and apple. The unpleasant odor of rubber gloves prevents me from awarding full marks to an otherwise exceptional aroma. Taking a sip, a deluge of berries first floods the tongue until appears a corrosive sourness that lasts long after the swallow. Pineapple, lemon and rubber share the denouement of this decidedly acerb lambic - even by Cantillon standards! My bottle was labeled 2001, and I would say it was already far downhill of its peak as the fruity flavors were not as apparent as in fresh Rose De Gambrinus, despite a double dose of raspberries.

From a 750mL Bottle, 2003 Vintage.  Somewhat hazy, ruddy pink colored pour with a quickly dissipating head of pale pink.  Juicy raspberry fruit aromas with hints of seeds, but lots of jammy sweetness.  Light herbal bitterness and musty, leathery funk.  Light bodied, sparkling mouthfeel with a bold acidity.  Acidic, fruity raspberry flavors up front, but the lemony gueuze-like flavors quickly replace the fruitiness.  Theres almost an ammonia like sourness in the finish, and it hides the fruits a bit too much without really providing any additional sour complexities, making it taste a bit muddled overall.  I certainly like the freshness and fruity tartness of the latest vintage Rose bottles substantially more than the raspberry flavors in this particular bottle.  8-4-7-3-15=3.7

Flavour is very sour with all the usual lambic characteristics and just a polite nod to the raspberries. Dry and tangy without the lick of sweetness at the finish that the Kriek had.

Extremely rich, authentic and elegant raspberry aroma, with an apple core aroma underneath.

Im a lambic beginner, but it just seemed well, not very complex.

I realize people expect this beer to be venerated as a matter of axiom simply because it is one of the best examples of a narrowly appreciated style. The thinking goes, ""if you dont like sour lambics, dont rate them."" Sorry, I just cant play along with that game any more than I would give a high rating to a certain brand of  ketchup stout or a turnip wheat simply because it was the best known example of the style. A $28 bottle of beer had better taste like liquid orgasm. Instead it tasted like raspberry vinegar. You are welcome of course to take my review with a grain of salt, but Im not going to celebrate a beer I find undrinkable just because its a prime example of an almost undrinkable beer style (though there a few  sour ales I find quite enjoyable). I tried to give Cantillon one more chance. Never again. All you super-sour lambic fans are welcome to this stuff.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

Amazingly strong raspberry aroma - wow! The fruit character really makes this beer - theres just loads of raspberry jam and a fair bit of seed character. Yum! Otherwise the aroma is the typical Cantillon character with the emphasis on sweat and dried fish. Theres also a fair bit of raspberry character in the flavour and an intense lactic sourness but I think Im coming to realise that a lot of Cantillons stuff doesnt really have much else. Whereas the 750mL bottle of Oud Beersel Gueuze went like a flash, it became a bit of a chore to get through the entire bottle of this, as there really isnt that much besides the fruit character and the searing acidity.

Fresh essence of mashed raspberries with dried leather and overripe peach pit hints. Feathery fluff to the carbonation. Slightly gritty texture. Exquisite raspberry flavor immediately arrives to balance the bustling tartness. Intensely dry, throughout, with a firm musty oak stamp soon grabbing foothold, deepening the tartness and adding more flavor depth. Understated, but masterfully utilized zippy brett character, couples with an herbal yeast flare which lends more dryness. Slowly developing scratchy mineral texture is curbed by a filmy maraschino cherry-like softness. Subtle notes of leather and medicine. Continual irony, dried apricot acidity bolsters the juiciness and lengthens the remarkably bright raspberry notes. Ends persistently juicy, yet briskly dry and acidic, with a shockingly harmonious interplay of brett, oak, and the vaguest touch of Pilsner malt that lingers long past its departure.

1136,"2004-09-04",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2006 On draught at Redbones in Somerville, MA.  You can imagine my huge surprise and delight at seeing a beer as rare as this on draught.  I assume its a 2002 bottling (kegging), but thats just an assumption, not really sure.

Pours a bright neon red, cloudy with no head.  Incredibly bright and a wonderful color, with obvious sediment mixed throughout.  Aroma has fresh, sweet raspberry, light fructose sugars, and hints of moderately tart leathery tannins.  A real bittersweet tartness.

Flavor is simply spectacular.  Surprisingly, this one isnt that all around tart (for Cantillon).  The raspberries dont taste musty or meaty, just quite sweet, ripe and fresh.  They mix in nicely with the light yeast notes, and tartness.  There is a winey/leathery acidic note throughout but it is coupled with a lovely, hefty wheat body and just sits on the palate and lingers on.  Finish is a bit thin, perhaps from being on draught so far from home, but that was the only complaint.  Smooth, lightly spritzy and medium-full bodied (loosening on the finish).  Great stuff and I will be going back for more very soon.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

However, that foreign beer bar on the way out did look terribly tempting. And Duff almost went apoplectic when he saw this was available. Go on then, even if it did mean a whole 750ml bottle between the two of us. Duff went into raptures and Ill let him do the superlatives once hes written up his thousand or so outstanding rates. Not to mention my crtical faculties being pretty numbed by this time.

1136,"2004-03-02",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2016 2001 Bottle Date, 2002 Cork Date: Sampled November 2016
The cork was old enough to start to disintegrate as I pulled it out, luckily most of it made its way out. The beer pours with a tan, one-finger thick, head. The beer is a concentrated amber color and shows a brilliantly clear, red-tinged, amber hue when held up to the light. Bright, ripe, floral, expressive raspberry aromatics greet my nose as I smell this. There is almost a childrens aspirin like quality here, but it is various shades of raspberry that completely dominate the nose.
Dry, effervescent, and quite sour, the beer finishes with a huge raspberry character, and something a bit like childrens aspirin. Tannic raspberry skins create an astringent finish that makes the acidity all that much more sharp. Musty underlying malt and lambic fermentation notes, a certain oak character, a hint of musky / barnyard, and a sharpness that suggests of cat-pee. The body is light, with a nice carbonation, yet has some tannic / lactic body to it that keeps it well away from being thin.
Unlike my notes on the 2002 bottle date, sampled in 2004, you definitely are not going to miss the raspberry character in this beer, it is quite omnipresent, and I wonder if that has to do with this specific vintage, or somehow the age has accentuated the raspberries. This is on the hard side of sour, and it is interesting that hard-sour Lambics seem to be a thing of the past now-a-days; most of the Lambic blenders have gone away from releasing beers that are this sour, though this one could have gotten more sour in the bottle. These Cantillon Raspberry Lambics see to have incredible aging potential; this one is 15 years old, and isnt showing any signs of being too old; this aligns well with the 17 year old Rosé De Gambrinus that I have had in the past too.
Bottle Vintage 2002, Sampled February 2004
Pours a deep hazy red color.  It is well carbonated and produces a pink head as I pour it into my glass, though the head disappears quickly.  There is an immediate aroma of raspberry seeds (fruity and woody).  A slight sour aroma is joined by a musty leather note, though raspberries certainly dominate the nose.  There is a good raspberry presence in the taste as well.  The raspberry fruitiness makes it seem like there is a hint of sweetness in this otherwise austerely dry Cantillon offering.  As expected this is fairly sour, though not extreme.  The beer has a tannic, woody aftertaste that coats the teeth and mouth like a tannic red wine.  A bit musty, but overall the Brettanomyces character seems subdued.

This beer definitely expresses the raspberry character more than the Rose De Gambrinus, though this is still quite dry so that the fruit can be hard to pick up if you dont know what to look for.  I really like how the acidity pairs with the fruit character.  This is a very well integrated beer, no one element overpowers the other.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

1136,"2004-02-22",4.1,"2001 Vintage.  Pours a rich amber red color with a foamy pinkish head.  Aroma is slightly woodsy with the sharp tartness of raspberries blended with it.  Flavor is slightly sour, but mostly reminiscent of raspberries with some woodsy underflavors.  Gets sweeter as it warms, full of yummy raspberries.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","JagerQueen"
1136,"2004-02-12",3.5,"2001 bottle. Head is initially small, fizzy, pink, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy medium red, bottle conditioned. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly yeasty (barnyard), with notes of raspberry and cask wood. Flavor is moderately sweet, heavily acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, heavily acidic. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, moderately astringent. Nice for a fruit lambic, good flavor balance, although raspberry dominates the aroma.  Would expect more yeast character in a traditional lambic, but as with most other Cantillons I've reviewed, the base aroma is fairly mild/meek/light. But the raspberry aroma is delightful and genuine here, so it was enjoyable.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1136,"2004-02-01",4.7,"2001.  Shocking pinkish red color, amazing they got this without food coloring.  Pink head fades.  Sour, horse blanket lambic nose, hints of rotting fruit.  Sour in the mouth, horse blanket, funk, then moving smoothly into a greenish raspberry flavor with a touch of sweetness.  Just great stuff.  Super Bowl beer!","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
1136,"2004-01-26",3.9,"2001 vintage.  Red-pink body which is quite clear, especially for a lambic-based product.  There was a pink head when I poured it out, but it disappeared almost instantly.  The aroma combines the sourness from the lambic whit the sweet fruitiness from the rasp-berries.  The flavour is almost what the aroma predicts.  Sourness combined with rasp-berries.  Although, I find the lambic has a dominant role in the flavour in contrast of the Cantillon Rose de Gambrinus.  The initial flavour is moderate sweet - sour, and it finishes stronger sweet and sour.  Quite long-lasting finish.  The beer is accompagnied by a fizzy mouthfeel.","Aarschot, BELGIUM","diabel"
1136,"2003-12-31",3.9,"Bottle of the 2001 vintage.  Reddish grapefruit color with a pinkish laced head.  A strong viney rasberry aroma.  Extremely dry.","San Francisco, California, USA","jazz88"
1136,"2003-12-27",4.3,"2003 bottle.  Initially I didn't get much head, but I did when I had the yeast of the last pour from the bottle.  Opaque hazy, beautiful red (matched in quality only by New Glarus Belgian Red).  Good aroma, it leaps from the glass driven by a propellant of some stripe (not the alcohol).  Good fruitiness, though I'm in love with the particular qualities of raspberry in beer.  Still, enjoyable.  The sourness is muted, not jawdropping as in some Cantillon beers.  The yeast acts nicely to give some underlying barnyard qualities.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
1136,"2003-12-13",4.4,"2001: Slighty hazy reddish hue with large fizzy pink head and good lace. Aroma displays the tart raspberry, barnyard yeast esters, oaken barrel, and aromatic hops I was fully expecting. Sour, mouth puckering, raspberry taste is very much on the front line of this beer. A nice undertone of creamy/sweet malt, fiesty yeast, and bitter hops round out what would have been a one-diminsional beer without them. The mouthfeel is lively yet soft and very dry upon the finish. While this beer style isn't for everyone, those who do enjoy a fruit lambic will surely enjoy this. YUMMY! Rating #900!","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
1136,"2003-11-05",4.5,"My second cantillon offering and this brewery is quickly becoming a favorite. What a fabulous beer, slightly hazy, pink/rasberry with a filmy head. The beer has similar characteristics of the gueze, musty, tart, with the rasberry coming in towards the finish, adding fruit wallop and subtle sweetness that balances and lingers. Great beer.","Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA","Jayb0"
1136,"2003-10-06",4.3,"Sticker on the bottle says 2001, but the cork says 2002.  Pours a pale copper ruby with a 1"" thick white head.  Good carbonation throughout.  Aroma of soft tart raspberries.  Flavors include cider vinegar, dry oak, and a light bitterness from the raspberries.  Also a faint sweetness, nowhere near as sweet as Lindemans.  Finishes dry and tart.  I liked this much better than the Lou Pepe Pure Kriek.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1136,"2003-08-11",4.3,"Draught Moan and Dove, AMherst MA...Deep red/raspberry colour.  Woody, barnyard, raspberry blossom, sour nose.  Earthy, wood, acidic and delicious.  Sour, pure and blissful.  I love it, as does my lovely raspberry girl, who wants some cheese to mingle with on her palate...","Amherst, Massachusetts, USA","Hopistotle420"
1136,"2003-07-26",4.2,"The meandering hard pan path leads me through the woods. . . Oak is in the air, at once I stumble upon a small wading pool that has a deep red tint, the pool is spring fed and the trickle of water is passing through a patch of raspberries, collecting the flesh from many of the large red berries.  I inhaled deeply and am rewarded with a nose full of raspberries, mixed with mud and stone.  I am drawn to the pool by a supernatural force, without thinking, I kneel and plunge my head into the liquid. . . raspberry seeds stick into my teeth, and the flesh ends up all over my face. . . I drink deeply, have my fill and as I look up, see Todd looking me in the face, all I can do is nod and smile in approval. . . I think he understands, Thank you.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
1136,"2003-07-08",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2011 2004 Vintage, rated 2011. Murky reddish-brown colour. Thin head.  Sweet raspberry aroma with cork, and light wood...kind of yoghurty.  Very tart, grippy sourness.  Lots of raspberry, wood, maybe light vanilla and faint brettanomyces funk.  Clean, and while not really balanced, it has the sense of balance that a lambic lover appreciates.  Same score. 2003 rating:  Deep hazy raspberry colour.  Rich wood, yoghurt notes. The raspberry comes off very fres.  Deep tartness beautifully balances the fruit.  Best framboise Ive ever had.  Thanks, Todd.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1136,"2003-07-05",3.7,"My impression is of sour, rotting, rasberries.  This sounds like a negative, but it's not in the hands of this brewery!  It's quite good, though I was left wondering how it's different from a cherry lambic...","Albion, Michigan, USA","hoppygrrrl"
1136,"2003-07-02",3.8,"(2000 @RBSG2003):  Pink/red cloudy body.  Aroma is barnyard and raspberry.  Taste is tart! then raspberry once you get past that (though that's not easy).  Light body.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
1136,"2003-07-02",3.9,"2000 version.  Massive raspberry nose actually tickled my nose. Very minute mustiness and woody aromas.  Tart to the tongue and a bit salty, this is raspberry overload, not leaving much for the natural lambic taste.  Still, a fine example of beer 'brewing'  artistry that is so rare and specific that I wonder if items like this will continue to be produced in the future!Earlier Rating: 10/21/2002 Total Score: 4.11999 LOU PEPE VERSION.  Champaign like feel with bursts of real fresh strawberrys.  Twice as many strawberrys in this than any other. Dry, barely sour end that tapered down the berry burst.  This can be used as a salad dressing for excellent results, but it runs about $50 per bottle.  Not a session beer by far, but a very interesting beer to sample.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
1136,"2003-06-30",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2003 A nice beautiful pink/red body and a light pink head.  The aroma is rather tart and acidic.  Not as intensely sour as other Cantillon lambics.  The flavor was plagued by the same relative mildness.  Still an amazing beer, but not quite the gem that other Cantillon's have been.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
1136,"2003-06-30",3.8,"RBSG2003. Far more tart than other quality Framboise I've had, less smooth somehow, less horseblanket/diaper aromas. A bit thin also.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
1136,"2003-04-28",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 29, 2003 '00 version sampled draught at Akkurat, Stockholm, Sweden in April 2003. 
Clear red and hazy. Acidic nose with fresh raspberries. The normal Cantillon sourness is here balanced by a welth of sweet, fresh raspberries. Complex and lightly woody with citric acid finish.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
1136,"2003-02-23",4.8,"Note: '99 means released now.
Colour: unbelievable deep cherry-red. When yeast mixes in, slight brown haze. Very little head (fruitacids and kernelcontents), deep rosy-red, but fast disappearing.
Nose: as a bucket of freshly plucked raspberries - only intenser. Slight nose of wet wood at the back. Also a waft of wet chalk on a blackboard. Taste: taste as from wild raspberries, but more subdued, with heavier wooden overtones. First impression, surprisingly, as from a southern Europe landwine, slightly diluted with water. Extremely refreshing. Very deep retronasal flavour, not aggressive, sourness mainly fruit acids. Hints of lactic acid and acetic acid, but below identification threshold.
Aftertaste: raspberries, lingering on and on, tart.
Mouthfeel: rather sharp, very dry but not aggressively so.

Lou Pepe ('Gramps' in Langue d'Oc, Occitane) stands for gueuze, kriek or framboise made exclusively with 2 year old lambics, preferably on pipes, used before only for wine (Bordeaux). Added is a sugary liqueur, instead of young lambic for secondary fermentation. Also, the content of fruit per barrel is 50% higher than the 'ordinary' Framboise. This is truly a world classic.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
1136,"2002-10-22",3.7,"1999 LOU PEPE:  Like the Kriek this is a ruby red color with an understated tart flavor.  The strawberries come bursting out, with not as much sourness.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"
