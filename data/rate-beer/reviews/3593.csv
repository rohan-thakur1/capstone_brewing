3593,"2016-07-26",3.1,"On tap at Arizona Wilderness, pours a hazy amber with a small off-white head. Aroma brings out toasted oak, English malt and bready notes. Flavour is along the same lines, with English bready malt, some toffee and oak, almost a subdued whiskey presence. Ordinary indeed, but quite well-done for what it is despite not being exciting. Decent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
3593,"2015-10-01",3.9,"Growler at home. Amber pour with slight head. Nice malt up front on the nose. Taste is smooth with a nice slight bitter aftertaste and a touch of oak.","Tucson, USA","jeffwhite10"
3593,"2015-10-01",3.7,"Taster pour at the brewpub. Reddish dark amber pour with a white head and lacing. Malty oak nose with a hint of tannin. Super easy to drink. Lots of malt and hop character, perhaps bolder than what you might find in the UK, quite good.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
3593,"2015-01-19",3.8,"I cant really tell what this smells like, but maybe an oak tree? Taste is light, malty, and bready.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
3593,"2015-01-12",3.9,"Draft at brewery, MAN OH MAN, Ive been to many pubs in London and it takes a lot for me to say this is the best bitter Ive ever had. Blown away, incredible smoothness and drinkability. Awesome awesome. Any bitter fans get this.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
3593,"2014-10-18",3.7,"On draft at the source. Crimson body with a thin, off-white cap. Fruity and bready aroma. Subtle oak and tannin character. Thin body with a dry finish. Interesting beer. Tasty.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

3593,"2014-10-10",4.0,"Draft at brewpub. Attractive clear reddish amber with a great frothy off white head. Delicious! Refreshing and chuggable. Pleasant light fruitiness, caramel toffee smooth maltiness. Hint of woodiness. Light dryness. Enjoyed to the last sip.","Arizona, USA","beerbaaron"

3593,"2014-03-02",3.8,"Pours an amber color with off white head. Aromas and flavors of caramel, toffee, nuts, oak, and just a touch of bitterness.","Arizona, USA","kcorum10"
3593,"2014-02-24",3.8,"Growler pours with a clear copper body that has thin gold edges and supports a weak tan head of bubbles. The aroma offers up a load of hops that have an earthy green bell pepper and spicy shallot hoppiness along with a mild spicy oak note. Behind those I get a light estery malt sweetened yeast note as well as a touch of roasted malts. The taste begins with earthy spicy shallot to green bell pepper and it then ramps up in hop bitterness to midway just as a spicy oak note surfaces. To the finish an estery yeasty note and a touch of roasted malts are noticed as the earthy shallot onion like spicy hop bitterness builds right into the after taste. Cool brew with lots going on for such a small beer.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
3593,"2014-02-18",3.5,"Orange brown pour with minimal head. Aroma is soft and nutty. Medium bodied, flavors of mild caramel, nuttiness, and some hop bitterness.","Arizona, USA","JustDrinkIt"
3593,"2014-02-18",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 20, 2014 On draft at the brewpub. A pleasing, moderate oak smell is the primary aroma, accompanied by caramel, light cereal, faint earthy hops, and a dash of vanilla. Pours dark reddish copper with a paper-white head. Mellow taste of oak, caramel, vanilla, a hint of almonds, and just the proper amount of bitterness to tie it all together. Medium body. It would very easy to have several of these in one sitting, and drinking this brew reinforces my belief at English-style bitters are the ultimate session beer.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
3593,"2014-02-18",4.0,"Quite the beer for only 4%. Brown in color. Good toffee and caramel notes, toasted grain, slight honey and the touch of oak brings in a nice woodsy character. Cool beer.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
3593,"2014-02-17",4.0,"Mild oak/wood in the aroma. More present in the taste. Slight bitter, burnt taste as well. Very enjoyable.
