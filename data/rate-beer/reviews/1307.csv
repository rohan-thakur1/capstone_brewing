1307,"2013-07-30",3.8,"Multiple pours tossed my way courtesy of TheAlum,  
Took me a number of hours to take these notes, so theyre damn well going to be cemented her into the database rightquick! 
 
Pours a deep red with not much in the way of head.
 
The aroma is raspberry and whiskey in the most pleasant way possible, woody, rich, sweet smelling, & jammy... but yeah... that doesnt really sound good, but it works here. 
 
The flavor is nicely berry forward with a jammy raspberry note that never takes the beer to a cloying place, the vanilla character is nice and the oakiness is a little subdued, lightly boozy... just a little spicy with some toasty maltiness. 
 
Again, describing it doesnt work very well really, its good but it doesnt seem from my descriptors that it would be.

 
Pretty good, thanks for the pour there Adam","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
1307,"2013-07-29",3.7,"750 ml bottle shared by TheAlum- thanks again, Adam! Bottle number was a bit rubbed off, but looks like 518/579. Pours a hazy plum brown with a small off-white ring for a head. Plenty of berry fruits present, along with what seems like plum, as well as caramel, brown sugar, oak, vanilla, and whiskey. Medium-bodied, with a fruity, malty, gritty mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. It all comes off as completely blended and swirled together; some might say ""muddled."" Individual notes dont pop clearly. Adam said its a few months beyond its prime, which makes sense. Still very good, though.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
1307,"2013-05-21",4.0,"Bottle, 05/21/2013, thanks to Kayn169 and FullObs. Pours dark earthy brown, medium frothy tan head dies to a haze covering hald the surface, moderate lacing. Aroma is pressed, pulpy ramble berries, seedy, background of vanilla, dark caramel fudge, oak. Taste of berries initially as well, though not as prominent as the nose, toffee and dark toasted grains, bitter spicy whisky finish. Medium palate, drinks smooth. Can see some similarity with Bramble BCS, but this is definitely different and its own thing. Very nice.","New York, USA","jbeatty"

1307,"2012-11-12",3.8,"Sampled at GonzoIllinis Birthday Party (Western Springs, IL). Happy Birthday, Tony! Pours a richer deep brownish pour, some glowing amber copper edges, richer haze in the body. A frothy offwhite head dies to a good film, laces ok. Aromas are gentle tannic raspberry, a touch of fruit. Toasty, gentle peat, caramel, kiss of vanilla. Some red fruit, aided by some raspberry pulp. Richer raspberry as it warms, integrating well with a more toasty, carmelized beer, some deeper sweetness. Initial is richer raspberry, a touch tannic, deeper pulpy and seedy flavors into the middle. Mixing with toast, caramel, and toffee. Thinned approproately, with gentle toast, vanilla, and biscuits. Some heat, touches of vanilla, gentle spirit. Raspberry elements grow into the backend and finish, some toffee, toast, peat. Gentle vanilla, red fruit. Touches of tannic raspberry, gentle fruit, and toasty malts. Gentle growing barrel. Nice.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
1307,"2012-11-09",4.1,"Big time scents of raspberry and great barrel notes with a bit of whiskey. Taste is similar with big barrel flavors and a nice raspberry flavor hidden in the after taste. You get a bit of the bread/toast flavor of Robert the Bruce, but it is masked quite a bit from the barrel.

1307,"2012-09-11",3.9,"#243/579. 750ml red waxxed bottle into a tulip glass. Huge thanks to apocalypsezombie for this bottle.

A - Pours a very dark red body with a two finger high light tan head. Settles down to a thin cap with thick edging and tight bubbling. Average amount of lacing and retention. Some thin and quick falling alcoholic legs.

S - Fresh raspberry preserves and booze. In the background is some light rye spice, vanilla, and toffee rich malts. It comes off very alcohol strong and raspberry heavy, but it really is a fantastic aroma. 

T - Much different than the nose. Starts off with bright raspberry notes, then comes a very mellow and subdued toffee and butterscotch malty flavor that I associate with scotch ales and wee-heavys. A touch of vanilla oak tannins, but the whiskey seems present mostly in a very noticeable warmth and not in the rye spice I was hoping for.

M - Light to medium bodied and somewhat creamy. Tons of carbonation, like far too much.

O - The aroma is excellent, but the taste is just average. I did enjoy it very much, and it actually succeeded in being a rather unique brew. But is it worth $35? Probably not, but it was worth the experience. Perhaps some aging will mellow out the booze a bit,","Connecticut, USA","davey101"
1307,"2012-09-05",3.9,"Very big flavors. Huge tart raspberry up front. Prominent rye barrel on the back end. Disappointing in the sense that Robert the Bruce isn't an obvious backbone to the beer. If that was more distinguishable this beer would be incredible.

1307,"2012-08-30",3.8,"Pours a darker brown color, tan-colored head, spotty lace, thin collar. Nose is lots of berries, some malty sweetness, light oak, smooth booze. Reminds me of Bramble, but less booze and more berries (if thats even possible). Flavor is berries, dark fruity, oak, smooth booze, with perhaps a trace of the base beer left after 18 months in barrels. Medium body, good carbonation, creamy sweet finish.

I would call this beer Bramble Lite, as it has a ton of berries but less booze when compared to fresh Bramble. I really enjoyed this one and had a second pour and our group killed the bottle, which is saying a lot. The booze is perfect right now and Im curious to see how the fruit does over the next few months in the bottle. As with Bramble, I think you either like it or hate it...not much in between. Overall, not sure why this one is getting such hate...I liked it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Sean9689"
1307,"2012-08-26",4.2,"The aroma is wild... lots of raspberries and fruits on top of some toffee malts.  On the palate, the beer feels soft and rich.  The flavors are quite different.  The raspberry fades into the background and more traditional scotch ale malty flavors with some balanced barrel flavors.  Not much of the whiskey shows through.  Lovely.","Bloomfield, New Jersey, USA","dogfishho"
1307,"2012-08-19",3.1,"Bottle shared by Mike, thanks! Was dark outside while pouring so I dont have much to say for its appearance, but the nose reminded me of BCS Bramble full of berries, oak, and bourbon. Taste was raspberry, blueberry, sweet malts, bourbon, a bit of oak, and a prominent sweet blackberry note (although I dont think there is any blackberry in the beer). None of the taste seemed to come together though and overall it tasted very muddled. Carbonation was good with an even mouthfeel. Glad to try this, especially at $35 because Im not sure that I would go out of my way to ever drink it again. Id love to see more Templeton character and less muddledness in a future batch though.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","sarro"
