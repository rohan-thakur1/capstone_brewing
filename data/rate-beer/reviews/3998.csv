Medium bodied.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
3998,"2014-02-17",3.4,"12 oz. bottle. Pours a very blackish brown with a tan head. Aroma of citrus, chocolate, mild tar and roast notes. The hop notes are more of the aforementioned citrus and pine. Flavor is bitter. quite bitter, with half the bitterness coming from the hop profile and half coming from the roasted bitter malt. Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel. This is good, but not a world beater.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"

Some cocoa powder, orange peel, and a touch of apple. Flavor is quite bitter and hoppy. Big time floral and orange peel notes. Lots of roast, some coffee, and semi-sweet chocolate.

3998,"2013-11-17",3.8,"Bottle from a friend in Michigan. Pours a dark brown to black with a creamy small half finger khaki head. Aroma of pine, roast, more pine, but of citrus, sweet chocolate malts. Flavor is sweet tropical citrus up front, some lightly roasted grain in between, a little spice, and a very nice sweet citrus left on the palate. Velvety mouthfeel with medium prickly carbonation. Very similar to Wookey Jack but not quite the bite and complexity. A very nice brew for the style.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"
3998,"2013-11-09",3.8,"Enjoyed on tap at Wild Monk. Served in a shaker pint.

A: Pours a dark brown color, almost black with a nice movement to it like an IPA. Dirty, off white head forms on the pour with solid retention throughout. Sticky lace down the glass.

S: Oatmeal flake sweetness and dryness with a solid roasted malt presence. Citrus orange notes with a nice hint of cocoa.

T: Intertwining layers of roast, chocolate and citrus. Mixing orange with cocoa powder and light oatmeal. 

M: Light, dry and roasty. Medium carbonation.

O: Nicely balanced throughout and not layered like most black IPAs. No odd chalky flavors usually get. Really enjoyed this one.",", Illinois, USA","Treebs"
3998,"2013-11-06",3.8,"12 oz bottle from De Bierkoning @ home. Very dark color, but not quite opaque. Uneven, dense beige head. Aromas: pine & resin, heavy roast, ground coffee, but also hints of sweet malts. Lots of pine retronasal, a little acidic. Flavor is moderate bitter, with some resinous acidity and roast. Medium bodied. Finishes ashy and quite bitter.","Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","PotjeBier"
3998,"2013-10-30",3.6,"12oz bottle, big thanks to umich03jm! Bottled in mid-august, judging from the half-smudged date stamp. Mostly clear very dark brown red color. Near black. Good half inch tan head, with good retention. Leaves very nice, thicker lace. Good roast malt, light dark chocolate. A lot of earthy, sort of citrusy hops. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, crisp lighter carbonation. More dry finish. Spiciness noticeable more as I go. Nice roast, light coffee, bitter dark chocolate in the aftertaste. Moderate bitter taste, some weet in the finish. A very light spicy bite. Solid black IPA. Probably even better fresh.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
3998,"2013-10-28",3.7,"Bottle - thanks cocoapuph! Pours dark black with a small tan head that diminishes fairly quickly leaving nice residual and nice lacing. Aroma is quite roasty with notes of pine and citrus as well. Flavor is lightly sweet, roasty, coffee, medium bitterness with a mix of piney hops and roasted malts. FInish has lingering bitterness.

3998,"2013-10-15",4.3,"An awesome, timely gift. Pours dark brown to black with a finger or so of fluffy, rocky khaki head that leaves some clingy lace. Nose involves dark and milk chocolate, light roasted malt, and a clean hop profile featuring pine, tropical fruit, and orange. Quite sweet, fairly bitter, a touch tart. Full bodied, fairly active, oily, creamy, with a long toasty bitter finish. Very good, glad I got to try it. Looking forward to any ""future"" Black IPAs Founders might be interested in making ;)","North Central, Indiana, USA","574deadzone"
3998,"2013-10-14",4.4,"I got this bottle from a friend for my birthday. I love the look of this IPA. The darkness really comes through in the mouthfeel. I got a lot of chocolate and roast in front of the hops. The bitterness was nicely balanced by the roasted flavors. I may have drank it too cold because the hops werent as pungent as some people like IPAs to be, but thats the quality of blacks IPAs. Awesome beer!","Florida, USA","Dogfish_Yeti"
3998,"2013-10-12",3.4,"Bottle thanks to woodchopper. Pours a very dark brown with a small beige head. The aroma is a bready malt and nuts. Thin mouthfeel with bitter malt and resin hop. Good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3998,"2013-10-09",3.9,"12oz Bottle. Thanks Sean! Strong pineapple and light papaya-lime aroma. Strong and enjoyable. Flavors come across similarly and have some pretty ass-kicking tropical fruit hop flavor, which is very enjoyable. The Black part of this beer certainly tends more Brown and hints at Carafa instead of yelling it. The hop work here is pretty delicious and the whole package is a quite decent IPA, with the darker malts complimenting, not fighting, a rare quality in Black IPAs indeed.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3998,"2013-10-09",4.1,"Draft. Poured clear dark brown color with an average frothy tan head that lasted and produced excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy complex toasted malt, earthy hop and alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy balanced toasted bittersweet flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish of long duration. This is a standout beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3998,"2013-10-08",4.0,"12 oz bottle. Pours a deep brown with an off-white head. Burnt herbal aroma with some hints of deeper dark malts like cocoa. Flavor roasty with herbal, floral, piney hops, some dark cocoa. I really like this; its almost a lighter, quality imperial stout with a prominent hoppiness.","Northville, Michigan, USA","flatmatt"
3998,"2013-10-05",4.1,"Had on-tap at BoatWorks in St. Clair Shores, Michigan for $5.25 a pint.

Appearance: Black. Looked a lot like the Mr. Hyde I had just had beforehand in every way (including head formation), except that the head on this one is a sandy color. Three fingers of head pillowed on top so high the pint got put in to a tall glass so the head could settle. Fantastic lacing. Lemme get my nose down in dare...

Smell: Oh, yes. Thats a black IPA. Super fresh, earthy hops are the big time thing I notice when smelling this beer. No fruit character on my nose, just a lot of grass and pine aromas. Keep in mind, I was two beers deep. The ""aftersmell"" has some of that roasted malt, but the hops definitely dominate the aroma.

Taste/feel: A LOT like the smell, almost exactly. The hops are very significant in here, with a moderate/high bitterness level. The aftertaste is a lot of roast, maybe with some coffee flavors. The hop bitterness is actually balanced a little bit by the already bitter roasted malt. Dry, semi-hoppy finish. I dont find it particularly complex as far as flavor goes, but I DO find it delicious. The feel is about medium, which is good for this... not too runny-thin, and not too feel-like-Im-drinking-a-meal thick. Drinkable, hopped up nicely, and just another well made beer from Founders.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"
3998,"2013-10-03",3.8,"Bottle. Deep opaque murky brown with orange highlights, medium to thin tan head. Loads of pine and spruce tips in the nose, bitter and smoky, with hints of black licorice. Pine and spruce also dominate the body; theres some citrus, and even some bubblegummy notes tucked away among chewy sugars. Very nice.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
3998,"2013-10-01",4.6,"Founders, you have done it again. No more will I drink a beer of yours with socks on. They keep getting blown off. From the overloaded aroma of spruce hops to the darkness of the body to the bitter bite and alcohol burn it ends with this beer is second to none. I recently had Stones Self-Righteous thinking that was the best Black I had had, well I hadnt had this. Best damn Black IPA out there.","Portland, Michigan, USA","BrownALEx"
3998,"2013-09-29",3.1,"Piney with roasty notes and hints of chocolate. Not my favorite style of beer, and consequently, not exactly a mind blowing beer for me. Not bad, but nothing special.","NASHVILLE, Tennessee, USA","jbrana"
3998,"2013-09-28",4.1,"Trade from umich43jm, thanks Jason! Pours coca cola black with a nice tan head. Aroma is grapefuit, lemon and pine. Smooth caramel malt dominated by grapefruit and pine hop. Finish is a little resiny and lingers. Very nice black IPA!","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"

Pours nearly opaque dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, tangerine, lemon zest, floral, pine, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted malt and hop notes; with good strength.

Moderate pine/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, pine, roasted malt, cocoa, toast, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted malt and hop flavors; with a great malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish.

3998,"2013-09-02",3.5,"Black pour with reddish hue; half inch of beige head and decent lacing. Aroma of sweet juicy citrus hops, a little pine hops, and cocoa-like malt. Light body, very soft carbonation with thin, chalky mouthfeel, clean, slightly bitter finish. Pine and citrus hops mixed very evenly with a chocolate and somewhat smokey malt bill. Similar to their black IPA but way less juicy and more pine. Very good but definitely let down in how they changed it.

Aroma is heavy pine and citric hop above a chocolate and lightly roasty malt backdrop. Dank, light resin, and cocoa powder, some ash and herb. Taste is not as ""hoppy"" as expected, malts burst through with some cocoa notes, light caramel, and a touch if roast. Hops introduce light pine resin and a touch of citrus peels with some herbaceous pepper notes. Not very bitter, easy drinking for what it is.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

3998,"2013-08-29",3.5,"UPDATED: OCT 12, 2013 The aroma is the best part of this beer, citrus, grapefruit combined with a bit of burnt malt. Very unique. 
Poured dark like a stout or porter. I admit that Black IPA is my least favorite style, and this one is no different. At first sip its like a very nice, citrusey IPA, which then settles into a bitter porter like flavor. Creamy mouthfeel is nice, and the beer is probably pretty good altogether, but not for me.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","Holtguy"
3998,"2013-08-27",4.5,"Bottle poured into an English Pint. Pours a dark, dark brown, almost black with a two-finger head that lingers around. The lace on the glass looks as beautiful as the beer smells. The beaming citrus aspect of the beer welcomes as any IPA should, and that hoppiness shows it's got potential to be great. The taste follows the virtue and hoppiness, as it swirls around the mouth, there is hints of the porter flavor, and it's just really good. The finish is nice and hoppy, just like you'd expect. Solid beer
