1768,"2015-10-10",3.2,"Pour is a clear copper with a large white head. Aroma is a decent caramel with a clean grain. Flavor is more of a slight dark bread grain with a bit of caramel and toffee. Finish is a clean lager refreshing. This was a decent beer and something you could knock back a few of while relaxing outdoors.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
1768,"2014-12-08",3.3,"The beer pours a clear dark orangeish with a large white head, and the aroma blends bready malts with toasty, caramel, and biscuity malts. The taste is mildly sour and a touch sweet, and the aftertaste has some sour maltiness that fades fairly quickly. The palate fuses a slick texture, average carbonation, and a medium-light body.","Columbia, Missouri, USA","EtTuCthulhu"
1768,"2014-11-23",3.4,"Hazy gold. Sweet maltiness....almost like frosted cereal.... (if thats a bad comparison I apologize. ...I dont remember eating cereal.) Light body. Another enjoyable civil life beer.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","gregwilsonstl"
1768,"2013-10-31",3.5,"Sample at Bridge Tap House & Wine Bar. The beer is a clear orange-amber color with a medium thin off-white head that dissipates quickly to an outer ring. Short strings of lacing. Aroma of roasted malt, caramel and hops. Light-bodied with flavors of caramel malt, roasted nuts and fruit. The finish is sweet with a malty aftertaste. Decent overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
1768,"2013-08-17",3.6,"At the source. Draws a nice golden with a superb small bead off white head. Not big, but stays and rings the glass. Gentle bready and fresh rain water aroma. Taste comes through as sweet caramel malt, and buttery biscuits along with the slightest pleasant hoppiness. Smooth, delicious. Nummy num!","OFallon, Illinois, USA","wxman"
1768,"2013-08-12",3.6,"Draft at Bier Station in Kansas City, Missouri. The pour is clear copper with a one inch slightly dirty white head. The aroma is mild caramel malt sweetness and a general toasted cracker malt. The taste is nicely fresh and clean malt, the sweetness and the dry cracker. The palate is light to medium bodied, soft carbonation, and a soft mineral dry finish. Really well made.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
1768,"2012-03-14",3.3,"Sampled at an ESBLS tasting.  Pat brought it a growler.  A brown pour that has floaties that barely move.  A soft aroma that has light fruit and nutty malts.  That describes the flavor, too.  This is smooth and just so easy to drink and is a bit sweet.  Almost no carbonation.  Nice.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
1768,"2012-02-28",2.4,"Shared 8 oz draft at the brewpub.  Dark copper, a shade off for the style.  The immediate impression is of wet mash, again with an extract-like sweetness taking over.  Drinkable enough.  (#4494, 2/25/2012)","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"
1768,"2012-02-04",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2017 Tasted at the 1st annual Urban Chestnut - Wolpertinger festival in St. Louis, MO, USA from tap into sampler beer boot. Poured a nice amber color with moderate white foam, lasting with a little lace. Malty, caramelly with faint roastiness and fruity fermentation. Reminiscent of Dos Equis but bigger, tarter, sharper, drier. Lagers are tough to micro-brew, but Civil Life did it well.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"
1768,"2012-02-04",3.6,"(sample at Urban Chestnut Wolpertinger festival) reddish amber with off white head. Mild slightly sweet malt aroma. Flavor is caramel/bready malt, slightly sweet.","Manchester, Missouri, USA","kwoeltje"
1768,"2012-01-16",3.8,"Really like what Civil Life did with this one.  Very well constructed and true to style.  Pours copper/amber with an off-white head.  The aroma has cereal, granola, toasty malt, some doughiness and mild sweetness - very smooth and well integrated aroma notes.  Medium body that starts smooth then feels a bit rough due to the moderate carbonation.  The flavor starts much like the aroma with a very clean smooth flavor and some nuttiness that wasnt detected on the aroma.  The finish has lots of nuttiness and cereal with just the right amount of sweetness.  It is clean, refreshing, true-to-style and sessionable ~ what is not to love here?","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
1768,"2012-01-12",3.6,"Draft pint at The Civil Life, served in a dimpled mug. Pours a clear orange-amber color with a finger-thick just barely off-white head. Nice dry malty aroma, with caramel and toasted malts, some sugars, and cereal grains- not much in the way of hops coming through. The flavor shows a bit of hops, but not much at all; more sweet and toasty malts, crackers, and grains. Light-bodied, with medium crisp carbonation and a malty, toasty mouthfeel. Very nice Vienna.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
