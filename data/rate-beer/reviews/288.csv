The aroma is full of tropical and citrus fruit with notes of juicy orange, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, and mango to go with a toasted bread and caramel malt base with some underlying pine resin. The flavor follows and is just as juicy as the aroma shows with the orange, grapefruit, and tangerine most prominent to go with a touch of pine and a firm hop bitterness on the back end while the toasted bread malts smooth things out. Medium bodied, smooth, and incredibly easy to drink with moderate carbonation that leads to a juicy citrus and bitter sweet finish. Really tasty stuff that drinks more like a single ipa.

288,"2017-01-15",4.2,"22oz bottle from Windsor Hy-Vee. Especially pungent grapefruit quality that really fills the room after the pour. Peaches, pears, apricots and white grape juice. Cloudy orange-yellow appearance reminiscent of apricot nectar, with one finger of pillowy canvas colored head. Nice spidery lacing as you work your way down the glass. Nicely balanced grapefruit tang and mild bitterness from the first sip, followed by biscuity beer malt, peach and apricot, with a moderately bitter finish. Light- to medium bodied, nicely balanced and conceals its ABV well with a mild bitter astringency. A really well-crafted and carefully balanced brew, almost worthy of the hype surrounding it. The alcohol does start to show itself somewhere around the half-bottle mark. Slightly more bitter and more boozy than pseudoSue for sure, it still retains a fantastic balance and provides a fine drinking experience. TGB knows what they are doing.

Great, strong, funky, citric aroma features scents of peach and grapefruit (the fruit, rind, and peel) as well as wet wood. Strong, dark aroma. Pours a dull, hazy brass with a large amount of beige head. A bit too much head, and the dull color does nothing for me. Light effervescence. Creamy, uneven head; that part is good. Good, thick lacing. Settles into a more pleasing, deep golden color. Cloudiness in final pour. Nice, funky, dank taste atop a fruit and vanilla-sweet base. Nice, dry, funky finish. Gym bag and armpit in aroma and flavor. A touch of piney toothpaste. A good Citra showcase. Quite tasty, bordering on delicious. Funky, dry aftertaste. Medium to full body. Soft in the palate.

288,"2016-11-16",4.4,"22 ounce bottle from Badger Spirits in Beloit, WI, served 10 minutes out of the fridge in a 35-year-old Andeker fluted glass picked up recently at Goodwill for .59. Im sure youre glad you knew that. Anyway...it pours a pale, hazy champagne-bubbly gold (turns out this glass was appropriate for showing off) with a moderate to large bubbly head, slowly diminishing and leaving fine lacing...really immense citric aroma - bitter orange and grapefruit, light sourdough yeasty qualities, a hint of thyme, a touch of wood smoke; it grows quite a bit more interesting and complex with 5 minutes out of the bottle....on the tongue, moderately sweet and lightly bitter at the front, growing towards a fairly strong bitterness at the finish (though still leavened by a bit of sugar) with cookie dough- sourdough yeastiness apparent throughout, helping to give the body an amazing mix of supple softness and thick fruity-juicy-acidic esters, always within perfect balance - its just insanely drinkable, with barely a hint of the alcohol, and the most velvety-smooth mouthfeel, coupled with soft, lightly tingly carbonation, imaginable. The only thing I can think of thats at all problematic is that there is a bit of a burn coming in if you do more than sip slowly, and the alcohol does grow a bit with warmth. But this is pretty terrific stuff all in all and Im certainly glad I was able to snag a bottle (only one, sadly) locally.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

La mousse nest pas particulièrement épaisse mais dun blanc maculé, riche et interminablement persistant. Un profil aromatique basé sur lagrume, à la manière dune IIPA de la côte est. Une salade de fruits à la clémentine, la tangerine, lananas et jen passe tant il y en a. Un cocktail de houblon Citra aux parfums des plus exotiques. En bouche le liquide mapparaît plutôt west coast alors que la première gorgée me colle au palais. Les notes dammoniac, caractéristique que lon retrouve souvent chez le Citra, sont assez présentes ici mais clairement tempérées par ces fruits insistants. Lalcool se fait sentir mais lensemble est tellement punché et explosif quon ne note rien des défauts de cette bière. Un chef doeuvre dans le style!","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
288,"2016-02-28",3.6,"Quite good. This ones brewed in Iowa not Florida which feels better. Solid iipa. Solid. Offers a gift of a good aroma, solid citrus hop taste with light bitterness. A joy to drink. Wickedly highly rated. Awesome beer but side by side with HALF ACRES DOUBLE DAISY CUTTER I think double daisy wins. And it's not even in the top 50 for iipa. So if it's good drink it. And this is good. So enjoy.

288,"2016-01-30",4.4,"Pours a cloudy orange-amber color with a solid, one finger broad head, which turns out to be utmost stable while revealing big, spongy bubbles.

Crisp citrus peel settles among flowery apple juice, together with white bread malts and a note of fresh cut grass. Has a mango ripeness to it, adding directly to the complexity of the citrus, while including soothing, flowery qualities among zingy kiwi. A resinous sweetness melts into the malts, creating a truly harmonious, yet aromaful nose.

Has a soft carbonation, present enough to provide a spritzy impact during the finish, which, apart from that, is completely soft on the tongue, producing a mellowing creaminess and an overall great mouthfeel. 

Tastes of a bowl of water, featuring fresh cut grass and a whole lot of juicy citrus and orange chunks. Due to the aqueous quality, fruits have a pleasant mildness to them, which vanishes, as the hops turn more powerful. Fruits turn crispier and a tad dryer then, while respecting the beers world class smoothness throughout, settling atop the rich creaminess. Reveals a fruit entangled malt sweetness after the swallow, slowly but steady transforming into a long lasting, citrus defined dryness. Even the bitter finish gets awesomely soothed by the outstanding mouthfeel, leaving the flavor focus on the fruits, while allowing subtle flavors to cut through during the late flavour transformation from malty to hoppy.

Flavourful and thrilling on the tongue, this one leaves me startled. It drinks like a dipa at the same time as it does not. First of all, the balance and mouthfeel in this are amazing, everything falls into place, citrus rages itself out on the palate leashed by smooth yeast, while no hint of alcohol becomes evident at all. Basically this drinks outstandingly easy. At the same time though, you can tell the intensity of flavors indicates a higher gravity, leading to a palate challenging complexity. Thats about it however, apart from that citrus unfolds playfully and most complex, remaining on the palate till the very end, providing even a certain freshness which lets you keep on drinking. Beautiful.","GERMANY","aleigator"
288,"2016-01-16",3.9,"Bottle dated 12/22/2015. 
Aroma is very hop forward with a medium light cracker malt backbone. Notes of grapefruit pith, orange, pine resin, and lighter notes of tropical fruit and melon. 
Pours a hazy, golden orange with a medium large, thick white head that shows decent retention as it slowly, but steadily recedes to a thin film. Moderate lacing and medium sized legs. 
Flavor is moderately sweet with some cracker malt notes and a but of light caramel and honey. Medium strong bitterness with a hint of the alcohol. Moderate fruity hop notes with a lot of grapefruit pith and lighter orange and tropical fruit, especially mango. A medium light resinous and slightly soapy note. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth.

The flavor is much like the aroma, citrus rind, orange, some white grape... but all this is hop driven. Its bright and juicy, its low on bitterness but has enough bitterness for balance. Its got a touch more alcohol presence than I would prefer, but beyond that its great. 

The truth is that I cant distinguish much difference from Pseudo Sue, which in and of its self is a compliment, as Sue is a fantastic beer. Although I prefer Pseudo Sue due to there being less alcohol presence, which is something I prefer to avoid in hoppy beers. This beer is wonderful, Im just not sure I could be bothered to get psyched up about seeking it out when I could just drink Sue on draught.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

Light only barely passes on the rim when backlit. Ozzys Crazy Train in the background, how fitting. Thick soapy white head fades to edge and leaves thick sticky lacing. Aroma is an aggressive blast of citrus, namely Citra hops. This beer is already King. Mild tropical fruit, but mainly orange juice bitterness and tang. Big malt presence also, but hops are the name of the game here. Flavor is bold and intense. Big hops and tropical fruit - pineapple and banana, etc. Words arent really adequate, theres a lot going on here. Alcohol is completely masked, and the impression that its closer to 10% than 8.5%.

I got the very last pour, so it was coming out of a pitcher that was used to let the foam settle after the keg kicked. Lots of lacing and a persistent head. Aroma is citrus and tropical fruits, grass, and some bready malts once you cut through the Citra onslaught. Taste is a light citrus/tropical sweetness initially followed by moderate grass and citrus peel bitterness on the finish. Medium body, very creamy texture (thought this might have been because the keg kicked, but others seem to agree), average to soft carbonation, dry finish with a nice lingering bitterness.","","sitzds"

Pours a completely opaque bright yellow orange, with two fingers of frothy, foamy stark white head. Excellent sticky lacing throughout. I simply cannot get over the sheer brilliance of the body on this... look like orange juice. Smell is bright citra hops full of grapefruit, tangerine, and clementines, with a touch of dank fresh hop and some characteristic peppercorn. Has an earthiness to it which I have never encountered in citra before, expect a touch in Hill Farmstead Double Citra, and Im loving it. The taste is... stunning. Unbelievably juicy and fresh, bursting with fresh squeeze orange juice, tangerines, and melon. There is honestly no malt profile to speak of. Body is incredibly juicy and refreshing, with the malt providing a fluffy backbone for the citra to thrive, but not contributing any real flavors. No trace of alcohol.
