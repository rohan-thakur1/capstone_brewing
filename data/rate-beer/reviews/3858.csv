3858,"2016-12-23",4.8,"Thanks Drew.
Poured into a becher pint glass, the appearance was a hazy semi-dark burnt orange color with a quickly dissipating fingers worth of white foamy head. Lacing was pretty messy.
The aroma bleeds bitter orange rind up front, bold and has an underlying danky sweet onion and then the bitter pine that exacts its presence upon a bold but zesty/sweet hop bitterness. Also, seems to have a sly sweet wheat in there.
The flavor blends all of the previously mentioned aromas wonderfully: zesty, sweet to bitter, subtle dankiness and the piney bitterness, full. Resinous bitter piney/zesty aftertaste with a quick finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a very nice sessionability about it. Mild carbonation felt fantastic dancing along my tongue between a creamy and bitter texture, weird, but its there.
Overall, what an absolutely fantastic AIPA that I believe gets hyped up as it does because the majority of reviewers are looking for the most complex beers. Yes, this beer has everything going on and still equates to a wonderful version of a brewers creativity and staying within the style.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
3858,"2016-12-15",4.2,"Can. The pour is a brighter hazy than some of their other offerings. The aroma is big hops as usual, slight spiciness to it. The taste is splendid like most.

Smell is guava, passionfruit, tangerine, peach pie, skunk and dank grapefruit. Smell is a 10/10. The flavor is not nearly as impressive (6/10), theres some pine, resinous and slightly sugary orange and heavy booze. Really surprised it has this much alcohol bite at 7.2 but that is a little big for my tastes these days. The heat didnt fade as I continued to drink it. Medium bodied.

3858,"2016-10-20",4.5,"Got in a BIF from oline73. 16 ounce can into signature tulip glass, canned on 9/15/2016. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange zest, berry, light pepper/pine, honey, light caramel, wheat, biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange zest, berry, light pepper/pine, honey, light caramel, wheat, biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine/grassy/citrus peel bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange zest, berry, pepper, pine, honey, light caramel, wheat, biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with an amazing malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/sticky, and slightly resinous balanced mouthfeel that is incredible. Zero warming alcohol for 7.2%. Overall this is an insane IPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the modest bitterness. A highly amazing offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

The nose is bright, floral passion fruit, a touch under ripe mango, some tart orange juice, and pineapple candy, with a light green grape hint. The flavor is a bit more pineapple with a lightly earthy, hint of bitter grassy note, but still lots of passion fruit and other tropical fruit.

3858,"2016-10-05",4.2,"Can from dbarnold, dated 9/15/16, received yesterday. Thanks Dave, even though you wont read this since you never rate anymore! Pours a murky orange color with an off-white head and drippy lacing. Big fruity hop aroma. Mango, peach, and orange juice. Pine and some catty notes as well, underneath the fruity hops. Fruit forward flavor, maybe a touch too sweet, but still delicious. Hints of spice, the pine/catty hops, and some light bitterness come through later on the palate. Way too crushable for a 7.2% beer. Medium bodied. I understand why people love to knock these beers, I really do. If you are looking for something that can hold up for months and show off beautiful subtlety, this probably isnt the beer for that. If you are looking for a delicious hop-forward, low bitterness beer to drink fresh, than this is gonna be the shit for you. Hops off soap box. Not sure why I felt the need to go off on that rant in this review, but Im leaving it in here. Anyway, I liked this quite a bit, and I could drink a lot of it.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

A very nice example of Mosaic hopping, with a somewhat danker, less juicy aroma than the Congress Street. Still getting citrus, but its more grapefruit rind and less juicy orange. Theres also a little stone or tropical fruit in there, but theres also just a hint of that cattiness you sometimes get with Mosaic, although its not overwhelming or off-putting at all. Overall it suffers just a little by comparison to Congress Street. Still an excellent A/IPA, mind you, and highly enjoyable. (17/20)","CANADA","UXO"

Hazy orange body. Medium white head. Nice lacing.
Herbal and piney. Like a really herbal Nelson hop. Sweet pale malts and some pilsner malts.

Taste is pine, grassy hops. Grapefruit. Tastes like nelson here, too. Pretty sweet. Strong pilsner malt flavor.

Medium body. Medium carbonation.
Good, but a bit of a disappointment compared to other Trillium stuff. Edit: I love reviewing a beer and describing flavors like nelson hops and pilsner malt and then finding out that neither of those two ingredients are present in the beer!","Florida, USA","ctipping"

3858,"2015-08-12",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 23, 2016 750mL bottled 7/10/15, drunk 8/4/15.Typical Trillium pour: big, rocky white head shows wonderful retention atop a hazy brass-copper body. This one was a little less hazy, having sat cold for a little longer than usual, but still, the haze never really goes away completely.Very boisterous, somewhat punchy hops in the nose show a wide array of tangerine, ripe peach, ruby red grapefruit and moderate lemon-lime. Pale malts remain in the background adding balance and no alcohol is noted, nor flaws. I was kind of hoping for more of a reserved congress street-like aroma, with some deep, dank, lush citrus and floral notes, but this one is brash, uppity and almost spicy in its presentation. The peachy-tangerine notes are a touch off-putting, but otherwise, its pretty fun, nonetheless.I swear I taste graham cracker-like malts, rather crunchy but not really taking any flavors away from the hops, which are still front and center. Vanilla-tinged honey malts provide balance, as usual, and at first I thought it was going to be a touch too sweet, but it never built up and actually worked well balancing all of this rather bitter, acidic lemon and grapefruit. Tangy peach, ripe tangerine and the eventual watermelon-like sweetness, with warming. Good and drinkable, like all Trillium pale ales, but just a bit too much twangy/punchy brashness. Dunno, maybe I should have let it sit in the fridge longer....8/5/7/3/14Canned 8/5/16.Huge mosaic aroma, but like their other mosaic-heavy beers, its big on the mushy nectarine-peach.  Theres some pine, but I think the sweet malts mix a bit too much with the hops to dampen the brightness, somewhat.  That being said, I dont find any punchy-twang that I did in the bottled batch above, and that one was almost 2 weeks older than this.  So a solid aroma, for sure, though not the usual deep intensity of other Trilliums.And the beer itself I find just a tad bit too sweet.  Granted its rich, lovely honey maltiness, but I think mosaic is better suited to more dry beers.  Still, this is fantastically easy, flavorful drinking.  Score is for this incarnation.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
