2238,"2017-05-10",3.5,"750 ml bottle brought back from Belgium and shared by JStax- thanks again, Jeremy! Bottled January 2009, although the label also said 37.5 cl, so Im not sure its to be fully trusted. Probably close, if not right on. It pours a cloudy copper with a finger of off-white head that settles into a ring and film. It smells like a musty gueuze, but the flavor is so different. Earth, oak, tea, tangy and lightly tart muddled fruit, dusty grains, and tons of residual sugars. Medium-plus bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sweet, lightly tart, and slightly funky mouthfeel. I forgot what a weird style this is.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
2238,"2017-05-08",3.2,"750 ml bottle shared with phaleslu. The beer is a clear copper with a creamy white head of foam. The aroma has a musty, earthy acidic character to it. Upon the taste, it is something entirely different. Its like a brown sugary sweet beer. Some acidity comes through, but the sweetness is what comes through the strongest. Medium body and moderate carbonation.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"

Slightly unclear golden body with almost no head at all. Nice mature aroma with smooth funk, wood and a hint of brown sugar. Flavor is sweet, but not too sweet, in fine balance with the acidity. Quite funky flavor for a Faro with just a hint of caramel, brown sugar and smooth fruity acidity. Fine balanced body and long lasting, very pleasant aftertaste that almost doesnt feel sweet at all.

2238,"2012-08-12",3.4,"January 2009 Bottle date; Sampled August 2012
A steady pour into my Bruery tulip produces a two finger thick, pale tan tinged head that leaves some lacing on the sides of my glass as it subsides. The beer is a dark amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, lightly red-tinged, bright amber hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells musty, musky, funky, and sour; grapefruit zest, moldy oak, urea, a barnyard muskiness, an almost herbal woodiness, and some spicy oak character.

Amply sour, lactic and biting, a solid carbonic effervescence also adds to this. Musky, Brettanomyces, funky phenolics, touches of medicinal notes that lingers, light urea, musty cobweb notes, and old dried leather. The sourness isnt actually aggressive for a Lambic, also the overall presence of this beer disappears in the finish; there is a light phenolic character, but mostly the beer seems to disappear pretty quickly after each sip. Flavors of lemon zest, some grapefruit, touches of caramel leaning oxidation that isnt quite cardboard like, a woody flavor, and some well cured plastic like character. The body is quite light, even too light for a Lambic, it doesnt have the palate presence / slickness that a good lambic usually achieves, and I am not sure why that is. As the beer warms up the curing plastic like character gets more prevalent.

Complex tasting and interesting, I dont like that the beer seems to disappear from the palate so fast, but ultimately this does not kill the beer for me. Enjoyable, but missing that something to take it to the next level for me.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Thanks to Markus for the bottle in a trade a few months ago. I finally had a special enough occasion to share this with others. It was a fine example of a faro. I wish more breweries would give the style a try but I know why they dont. Hopefully I can find a few more myself.

Aroma / Appearance - The carbonated caramel body glimmers. There is almost no head among the tart sourness, caramel, black cherries, and Pop Tarts. The blend of sweet and sour is gentle without being sharp and intense.

Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel is bubbly and bright. Wood, tart aspects, and the feel of a young Flemish sour perk up the senses. A great example of what traditional brewing experience can bring I wish I could have had more. While not a daily drinker it is an excellent change of pace.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

2238,"2012-02-07",3.6,"75cl bottle. 2011 vintage. Pours a clear burnt golden color with a medium creamy white head. Quite lasting foam. Aroma is musty and funky. Some tartness as well, but dust and must dominate, a bit of fart-like suplhur too. Taste is moderately bitter up front, slight tartness. Some funk and lemon zast. Finish is dry and leaves a bitter sftertaste which recalls burnt brown sugar. Lively carbonation and medium body. Overall, not really great, but at least the sugar does not dominate over the acidity and the overall result is quite balanced. It seems, though, as if the brown sugar adds some more off-flavors which I could push myself to appreciate completely.","Rimini, ITALY","teorn88"
