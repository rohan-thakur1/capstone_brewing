2621,"2016-10-12",3.3,"This beer is just fine, not very true to style imo because it lacks the developed yeastiness Id hope for from the style and is more like an American wheat beer but hey, its another Kristallweizen.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
2621,"2016-10-07",3.6,"Tap at a sake place in Shinbashi, Tokyo. Poured cloudy willow, decent white head. Deep yeast spices complete with banana in the nose, quite sturdy feel to it. Flavour has some cloves spice, more banana and weizen yeast. Again, surprisingly well brewed, thats a solid weizen.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
2621,"2016-07-09",3.3,"0.33 l bottle from a food store in Tokyo. Aroma has yeast, faint banana? Appearance is pale, cloudish and nice head. Taste has crispness from wheat and sweet taste from the yeast. Bananas are quite ripe.","Helsinki, FINLAND","thellgren"
2621,"2016-02-14",2.9,"Bottle from Daiei. Light bubblegum and banana notes with a touch of clove. Slightly watery for the style with maybe a touch too much carbonation. Sweet with some light tang towards the finish. Refreshing, but thin.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"
2621,"2014-07-27",3.4,"Bottle from Top World Supermarket. Solid banana nose, sweetish with some bubble gum notes. Cloudy light, murky yellow, and not much head (for a weizen). Well-rounded wheaty character (which falls off too quickly) , tangy, lightly sweet, and very mild hopping in mid and final. Thin-medium body, with just a touch of astringency. Good enough. A bit thin in flavor.","Hirakata, JAPAN","maekchu"
2621,"2013-04-17",3.9,"Draught at Bungalow. Very enjoyable sweet palate. Hints of vanilla at the end. Never cloying and enjoyable on the second pint.","JAPAN","HKAndy"
2621,"2013-03-10",3.0,"Draught. Cloudy yellow, snow-white foamy top. Pretty sweet nose of candy, bananas, some grainy malt. Nice and smooth, but as others have noted, has a slightly sharp aftertaste. Still fairly quaffable but.","Kyoto, JAPAN","Westkyoto77"
2621,"2010-09-09",2.3,"Loved Umenishikis Bock beer...but this attempt at a Weizen just falls flat. Quickly dissipating head on a milky murk of gold. Tastes more like a cup of rainwater than any Weizen Ive ever had. Probably best to avoid.","JAPAN","buzzoven"
2621,"2009-11-04",3.5,"Pours a hazy dark yellow with quickly disappearing white head.  Aroma smells faintly of wheat, but lacks yeast.  Taste is wheat with a hint of banana.  Very nice mouth feel, and a very well balanced beer!","Seattle, Washington, USA","improvjock"
2621,"2009-03-20",2.2,"UPDATED: MAR 22, 2009 Heavily carbonated clear yellow body with tall but completely diminishing head. Bubblegum, wheat, and grain nose, hint of banana and clove. Very clean taste and a bit to sterilized for me, Im getting some metallic notes. Definately wheat and some clove, but some soap and stainless steel tartness, I almost want to say chlorine. Oh - I just did. Palate is smooth, but carbonation is a bit active and biting. I just cant seem to find something I like about this one. Im more into the earthy/hazy/dirty weizens I think. This tastes too clean and metallic. I suppose that  is  the style though. Not for me.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","TheJollyOne"
2621,"2008-12-27",3.0,"Bottle. A kristalweizen. No yeast. Golden with a tall head. Rather hoppy aroma of wheat malt, barley malt, bananas and spice. Almost more like an American wheat ale. Rich wheat malt flavor, though, with bananas and cloves. Pleasantly rich and smooth mouth feel as well. Good balance of sweet, sour and bitter, but not really so interesting.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
