4279,"2016-10-26",3.6,"Half-Liter glass stein on tap at the 2016 Urban Chestnut Oktoberfest. It poured a mostly clear golden colour, very lively foam, long-lasting with lace. Grainy, biscuity, grassy, black pepper spice, noble hop balance. Definitely Germanic in style, with a faint tartness not found in classic examples, but supported the dry finish in a nice way. Tasty and refreshing.Earlier Rating: 12/29/2012 Total Score: 3.6Tasted from bottle into a snifter. It poured a mostly clear orangish-amber color with persistent creamy off-white foam and a little lace. Aromas and flavors of bread, sweet malts, caramel, faint noble hops, faint black pepper. Smooth and balanced, it tasted a bit like an Oktoberfest but fruitier with a mellow spiciness. Mild, balanced and unassuming. Good stuff.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"

With malt slightly winning overt in the taste expression, with a nutty biscuity ness. This has a slick drink ability and hop expression that is unique to the style.","Alabama, USA","thomas15"
4279,"2012-10-20",3.5,"Pours a clear pale amber with a nice white head.  Slight bready aroma.  Sweet toasted malt, buttery, bready and light hop taste.  A really good Munich/Marzen!  BTW, this beer is identified as a Munich style lager by the brewmaster.  There is nothing Dort or Helles about it.  Dont know who entered that into the description here, but it goes against the brewers description and the taste, overall appearance and mouth feel.","OFallon, Illinois, USA","wxman"
4279,"2012-10-15",3.3,"It poured a golden color with a small white head. The aroma was some  maltiness with hops and a little roastiness. The taste was also similar with maltiness and hops. It was a lighter beer than they normally brew, but still very good.","Wentzville, Missouri, USA","jandd1983"

4279,"2012-06-18",3.5,"Draft at Perennial. Pours a bit darker than a typical Dortmunder/helles; rather than a clear gold, this one is more of an orange color with a small off-white head. Notes of pale and cereal malts, grassy hops, straw, crackers, and toasted sugar. Light-bodied, with medium-high carbonation and a crisp, dry mouthfeel. I split a small one with my wife, so I need to try this one again and re-rate when I get a better handle on it.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
