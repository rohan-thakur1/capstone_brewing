The aroma is light to medium roasty with raisin and other dark fruity elements and pushing through, also a touch of spiciness - intriguing.

Not a lot of alcohol in the nose. Hold the first sip on my tongue (because I have a new filling in one tooth that complains whenever something cold comes near it). Theres a bit of cardamon from wheat malt and a weizen yeast ferment. Stiff malts and a tickle of noble hops prevail. Alcohol does not detract from taste, instead adding some mellow smoothness as it builds up in my lobes.

Pours pretty much jet-black with a medium dark tan head that quickly dissipates to a thin tan ring of foam. I wouldnt judge this as a wheat beer based on its appearance. Aroma holds doughnuts/fritters (apple cinnamon), dates, chocolate, and roasted malt. None of the standard banana notes here, but their absence is easily forgotten due to the presence of the other scents which have taken their stead. Taste is dark fruit forward, with flavors of plum and date showing up initially that transitions to cola, then chocolate, and finally the chalky/tart wheat flies in on the finish to remind one that theyre drinking a wheat beer. There could be a glimmer of peppermint here. Mouthfeel is creamy and carbonation is to style.

Appearance: Pours a very dark brown body with an inch of firm, lace-yielding, beige-colored foam.

Smell: Anise seed powder and rubber door stoppers ride atop the notes of dark malted wheat and tenuous touches of chocolate and fruit.

Taste: Roasty, wheaty with thin hints of everything from coffee to mild chocolate to store-brand cola to a vague nuttiness. Moderately sweet. Pinch of spicy nutmeg. Roasty, rubbery vibe mixed with anise arise midway, and, for me, the taste sort of derails at that point.

Nice, but a bit light, nose of dark fruit (prune, raisin), wheat, caramel and a touch of earthy hops.

Medium body with a texture that approaches creamy. Superb carbonation level with a nice effervescent middle and a finely bubbled prickly finish.

The flavor profile is outstanding. It is moderately intense, highly complex and very well balanced. It begins with a wheat tartness that flows into the dark fruits - raisin and plum with prune underneath. A rich bready caramel balances the prune resulting in a slightly sweet background that highlights the plum. The middle hints at bitterness and tends to be roast rather than hop oriented. The finish is a slow fade of receding sweetness that succumbs to prune coupled with a subtle dryness.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

760,"2015-09-25",3.5,"Bottle from Briarwood Liquor: Poured a dark brown liquid that was opaque while a thick pillow of foam cap rested on top. Aroma is tantalizing with a whiff of barrel aging wood, lightly roast malt and sourness from the yeast. The taste is tart with notes of sour and bitterness while also having a dried fruit flavor of plum, grape raisin, and apricot profile. The tartness makes this beer remind me of an English barleywine but the yeast used assures me that it is a dunkelweizen. Packs a punch with an ABV of 7 but at the same time the tart flavor makes this beer difficult to drink more than a couple bottles of it. Only picked this up because I had never seen it and didnt want to miss out on it but distributing a winter wheat beer during the months of summer is unheard of, and Im not sure if I agree with it.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"
760,"2015-09-20",3.8,"Sampled December 2014
A steady pour into my globe glass produces a fat-two-finger thick, nicely brown stained, dark tan colored head. The beer is a rich, dark, dark, chocolate brown color that is almost black; it is dark enough that it is quite opaque, even when held up directly to the light. The aroma smells of dark fruit and rich maillard-leaning malt; prunes, raisins, and rich caramelized grain, as well as a wholesome, molasses sweetened, dense, dark, sweet, bread note (think of a sweet, holiday bread of some sort, or perhaps a dense fruit cake without the fake fruit notes).

The beer is nicely carbonated which accentuates a lightly bitter, smooth roast character in the finish. The body has a certain richness and chewiness to it without hindering this from being quite quaffable. Flavors of roasted raisins, slightly burnt prunes (is there a hint of carameilzed banana and clove here too?), as well as a lightly sweet, toasted, dark grain character, a bit of coffee like roast character, and a rich, dark maltiness that is reminiscent of a rich, deep dark bock (though not nearly as heavy or concentrated).

This is a really nice beer, somehow it is greater than the sum of its parts, as I cant quite put my finger on why I am enjoying this beer as much as I am. In the end it is tasty and interesting, and sometimes you really dont need more than that in a beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

760,"2015-01-24",3.3,"This is an interesting brew. I dont know what Anchor calls it but as of January 2015, RateBeer calls it a dunkelweizen which I dont think quite fits. Its sort of porter-like with a fruity character that seems to come from the yeast. Its garnet brown in color w/ a head of fine bubbles. Coffee-like roast notes mingle w/ apple and maybe a tiny hint of spice. This has a nice creamy texture w/ soft carbonation and comes off a little sweet, mostly because there is hardly any hop bitterness in the finish.

760,"2014-12-31",3.5,"When you think wheat beer you tend to think of lightly-colored brews with fluffy heads and banana notes. Anchor Winter Wheat is about 180 degrees removed from that image as its dark as a porter and opts more for roasted maltiness and hints of dark fruit. In fact, this probably is better judged as a porter than any kind of wheat beer, though I suppose specialty grain would be the appropriate style to view it as. Its certainly an interesting beer and definitely has a unique recipe, and in that aspect it works pretty well.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a weizen glass. It was bottled on 9/26/14 and cost $2.75 ($0.23 per ounce).

Appearance: Deep black in color with red highlights. Pours to a large, brown, foamy head which mostly dissipates, but laces fairly well.

Smell: Mild nose with hints of dark malt, some fruity sweetness, and milky/dairy notes.

Taste: The first thing I notice about this beer is that it really doesnt taste particularly wheaty, despite the brewerys description of so many different varieties of wheat used in the brewing process. Its closer to a standard porter as the dark malt is the most prominent flavor and it finishes  initially  with a dry bitterness and a dark chocolate sensation. Eventually, that confectionery note gives way to a general mélange of dark fruit and dark malt. The wheat is surprisingly muted, creating for just a slight tanginess on the finish. I did enjoy the almost lactose-like character, but I wanted so much more. Why not ferment with Bavarian yeast to give it a chocolate-covered banana taste? No that wouldve been memorable.

Drinkability: I was rather shocked to see the 7% ABV on the label, since Anchor Winter Wheat drinks more like a light-bodied summer wheat. The mouthfeel is soft and calm and goes down smooth like a hefeweizen. However, it doesnt have the gusto or raw energy of a strong beer, which it should. I appreciate the easy drinkability, but Ill penalize it for finishing entirely too clean.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
760,"2014-12-30",2.7,"Bottle. Dark brown with a tall but short-lasting brown head. Malty and yeasty aroma is roast and ink and soy sauce black malt, nutty and toasty wheat, pepper and sea salt, light touches of plastic / vinyl. Esters provide some amount of fruit character, hops are lightly herbal and grassy, and with warmth the malt opens up into more of a raisin / date character. Medium body, chewy and syrupy in the mouth, simple dark caramel malt turning to burnt popcorn in a short, sweet, watery finish. The aroma seemed decent to begin before the head collapsed and the salt + pepper liveliness was replaced by a simple burnt cola and raisin aroma with the ink and plastic off-notes creeping. For me the flavor balance is wonky, the body too syrupy and the finishing flavor of burnt pancake batter unpleasant.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

The smell, unlike a fair amount of dunkelweizens Ive had has a lot of roasted bready notes up front. As it warms, theres a nice sweet banana connotation to it.
The taste took the roast with the bread and added a light chocolate to seem to have made it taste like banana/chocolate toast. Cool, I think I like it.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent degree of sessionability about it. Theres a nice rolling roasted banana chocolate goodness over my tongue.

I was thinking wheat beer, so naturally I was surprised when the beer poured jet black with a tan head. The aroma is interesting, but mild with hints of root beer, licorice, light banana and cocoa. The flavor has more roasted notes with dark fruit, licorice, wheat, cream soda and subtle raw banana. The mouthfeel is pretty light and moderately frothy. Overall, an interesting beer that grew on me as I drank it. Actually, I picked up another sixer since I enjoyed it so much. Very good stuff.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
760,"2014-12-11",3.8,"You know what? This is pretty damn good. Reminds of some of the darker German wheat beers--little sweeter than I would have expected. Looks beautiful. Good job on this one. 12oz pour from bottle.","San Diego, California, USA","matthewjk"
760,"2014-12-10",4.0,"12 oz. bottle.

Poured clear but very dark brown with a large, creamy tan head that had very good retention and left excellent patterned lacing on the glass. No sediment.

Aroma: ""enticing"", as claimed, with faint hops and spiciness over a solid malt base. Hints of dark fruits, toffee and roasted nuts.

Excellent balanced flavor with subtle complexity. Dark bread with hints of licorice, roasted nuts, coffee (in the aftertaste), and molasses. Mildly bitter. 

Feel: Excellent! Medium body with a near creamy texture and ample soft carbonation.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
760,"2014-12-09",4.0,"Didn't see this coming. Pours deep, dark brown with a fluffy tan head. Not your everyday Wheat beer. Aroma of cocoa powder. Taste is malt forward with spices that linger. Bottle from Trader Joe's.","","RevBFG"
760,"2014-12-08",4.2,"Very dark brown but not black crystal clear body with a small finely textured brown head. Aromas of cocoa and roasted malt and maybe a slight sour tinge. Cocoa and dark chocolate come out in the taste which is a combination of a dunkleweizen and a bock beer. Full body probably from the wheat which gives it a creamy texture. Definitely malt forward but there is a slight astringency and bitterness which balances out some of the chocolate sweetness.","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"
760,"2014-12-07",3.0,"Dark brown pour with a thick foamy tan head.
Aroma is chocolate malt very light banana. Se coffee. Bit bland.
Flavour is coffee roasted, light banana again, tailing off to a faint coffee finish.
A bit homogenized for me. Light flab, light aroma. Was expecting/hoping for a bit more from this one.

760,"2014-12-05",4.1,"Anchor Winter Wheat has a very thick, beige, crackling head, an extremely dark brown appearance, with lighter brown around the edges, and decently heavy lacing left on the glass. The aroma is rich, sweet, bready, metallic, nutty, and crusty. Taste is of those elements, with not so harsh bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy and somewhat velvety, and Anchor Winter Wheat finishes semi-dry and pretty well drinkable. RJT","Laplace, Louisiana, USA","ronaldtheriot"

760,"2014-11-27",3.3,"12oz bottle. Thought this would be a light drinker, then opened it up and whoooooa it became immediately apparent that Im boarding the train to Sillytown next stop making an ass out of myself in front of the inlaws on Thanksgiving yeeeeeeaaaah! It is black. That is all. The head is tan and lasting. The aroma reeks of booze and winter and wheat. Some spices in there - nutmeg, cardamom maybe? The flavor is somewhat sweet and rather alcoholic. Spice, wheat, and licorice. Full body with big booziness. Shockingly intense. Shouldve read the ticking notes from the other tickers here on RB first.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
760,"2014-11-23",3.4,"12 oz single from Biggie Wine & Spirits. Almost black appearance with a light tan head. Aroma of mild spices, bready malts, light roast, earthy hops, toasted grains and bitter chocolate. Similar flavor, a little heavy on the spices but otherwise a pretty tasty dark beer, almost like a porter.","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"
760,"2014-11-22",3.8,"12oz bottle picked up at Trader Joes. It pours with a mahogany colored body that supports a thin dark tan head. The aroma offers up molasses, a bit of cherry, some smooth winter spicy notes and a smattering of roasted malts. The taste starts winter spicy and then heading into molasses and spicy black licorice. To midway it picks up a light dark roasted malt note, a bit of woodiness as well as thin snippets of cherry meat. This is a nice winter ale with a pleasing balance of spices and malts.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
760,"2014-11-22",3.2,"Draft. This might need to be listed as a dunkelweizen, it isnt one but I was shocked when it poured a dark brown with a creamy tan head. The aroma is mixed cereals, bakers chocolate, spices. Flavor is interesting, typical anchor yeast with a balsamic note. There is a lot of black currant, acidic coffee, some peat, cocoa, spice, savory. This is an interesting beer, no doubt a dry and savory one, good for the holidays I guess.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

760,"2014-11-20",3.8,"Bottle from the Davis Co-Op. Pours quite dark brown with a dark tan head. Aroma is not hoppy, more a mix of dark malt and med dark fruit. With some chocolate. Med body. Flavor is dark malt, med dark fruit, chocolate and tends to end with a earthy flavor reminiscent of aged cheese. (Think CowGirl RedHawk approaching ripe). Finishing not very sweet, but not very bitter either. Quite tasty and interesting.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
760,"2014-11-17",3.9,"Cola body, with decent head and carbonation. Lovely blend of smooth roasted malts, wheat, and yeast to conjure a dark fall night after a good seasons harvest. Likewise the body is quite well-crafted. Perfect body pitch, with flavors of smooth roast barley punctuated by a spritz of crackling black patent, accompanied by a bountiful heaping of wheat and screwed together by well-suited yeast that contributes an edging of esters and phenols. Another outstanding offering from Anchor.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
760,"2014-11-17",4.0,"Definitely a good one from Anchor. I know I said the same thing about their IPA the day it was available in SF. Like their newish IPA, it has a traditional take. Although, I find this to be more like a wheat bock.","Petaluma, California, USA","steview"

760,"2014-11-16",3.8,"This was a pleasant surprise. Pours quite dark with a large tan pillowy head. The aroma has cream, vanilla, smooth wheat, chocolate and dark fruits. It has a full body that is very smooth and lush with gentle carbonation. The flavor begins with roastiness, chocolate, husks, berries, cream, vanilla, light char and wood. The finish is quite dry with more wood character, dark chocolate and smooth vanilla. Really nice and hearty. Would be great for cold winter nights.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
760,"2014-11-15",4.0,"22 ounce bottle. Pours an opaque brown with a dense creamy tan head that clings mightily to to the glass. Aroma is earthy malt with dried fruit and plum notes. Sweet roasted malt flavor has a subtle wheat-like nuance with more dried fruit, like dark cherries and raisins. Very malt forward with rich wheat undertones, but their is a nice spicy citrus hops, as well. This reminds me of a slightly milder version of Anchors Our Special Ale. Very tasty and very drinkable. Well done!","Hamilton Square, New Jersey, USA","gripweed57"
