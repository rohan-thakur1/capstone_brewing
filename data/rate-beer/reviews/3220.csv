3220,"2016-07-19",3.0,"Draft to taster at Dutchs. Pours a clear golden color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have grainy malts, some sweetness, light florals, just not much to get excited about.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
3220,"2016-07-11",3.2,"Draft at the Growler Bar at Kroger-Oakley. Pours a clear gold with a small white head that settles into a ring while lacing the glass. Notes of straw, light fruit, floral zest, sweat, and pale malts. Light-bodied, with moderate to medium carbonation and a mostly clean mouthfeel despite some minor sharpness and bitterness. This should wind up being a category killer in due time. Good, clean, refreshing stuff.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

3220,"2016-07-09",2.9,"on tap @ Warped Wing / Dayton OH --- Clear straw amber color, white head that quickly settles to the rim, blobs of lace. Taste is fizzy light malt with a small hop shot in a light, watery finish. No doubt about the 4% abv. Not a keeper.","Lakeside Park, Kentucky, USA","rondphoto"
3220,"2016-07-09",3.0,"16 ounce can, canned on date of 06/08/16. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy straw gold color with maybe a quarter inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. Aroma is subtle, the brew smells like bready malt, along with some grassy hops. Taste is similar to the aroma, but theres also a bit of apple noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is light, its smooth and goes down pretty easy. For the style of beer it is, its not bad at all. But for the price I probably wouldnt buy it very often. With that being said, its worth trying at least once and I wouldnt turn one down. $2.49 for a single can.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

3220,"2016-06-16",3.3,"Sample at The Ohio Taproom. Clear pale golden color with a medium thin white head that dissipates quickly to an outer ring. Spotty lacing. Aroma of malt, grassy hops and fruit. Light-bodied with flavors of mild hops, bready malt and a bit of fruity yeast. The finish is mildly bitter with a short grassy hop aftertaste. Decent overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
