836,"2015-05-02",3.7,"Tap @ HotD poured deep amber with a thin head. Warming alcohol, but with a thinner body that made it very drinkable. Oak, brandy spirit notes, brûlée, toffee, and mild oxidation rounded it all out.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"

836,"2015-02-21",3.6,"Tap at the brewery.

A: Cloudy, orange-brown, foamy off-white head.

N: Brandy, brown sugar, toffee, some overripe cherry, cola, coriander, light peppercorn, biscuit, licorice, and damp leaves. 

T: Big malt sweetness, some light tartness (not infected.) 

M: Medium body, biting, fizzy carbonation, no alcohol.

O: Solid barreled lager. Much better than the original, of which I was not much of a fan. The brandy adds to this without subtracting from the base beer (as meh as it was). Worthy of your purchase.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
