4317,"2017-04-19",4.3,"Bottled in 2014, this Yorkshire Stingo leaves much to be desired on the aroma. Strong on stone fruits, smells damp (presumably from soaking in the barrels), oaky. Maybe some yeast. A little spice.

Appearance is amber, rose, copper. Head quickly reduces to a solid ring around the glass after pour.

Taste is wonderful. A quick and pronounced hops flavor moves immediately to malted caramel, which lingers until it turns alcoholic, which pleasantly and warmly transitions to fruit (raisin and fig). Fruit lingers, undernotes of oak emerge, leaving a pleasant spice (nutmeg, a SLIGHT hint of cinnamon) aftertaste.

Mouthfeel is watery, dry, quickly fleeting. Its surprisingly light considering the prominent malt and caramel flavor.

4317,"2016-10-29",3.7,"I bought this bottle because Im a fan of oak-aged beers. While this is not the bourbon-barrel-aged variety to which I typically gravitate, it does not disappoint  and is undoubtedly more refined in flavor because its from a non-charred aging oak barrel. 

Big bottle pours a hazy red-orange-brown color. There is light-tan medium-height foaming from carbonating yeast eager to get out of the bottle. Virtually no Belgians lacing on glass. 
Aroma is perplexing. Through the earthy overtones, I faintly make out dates, figs, toffee, raisins, brown sugar and caramel.

A slow sip brings to the taste buds all of what was hinted at from the nose, adding in a sweet, buttery coffee cake. Talk about effective foreplay! Drinks smoothly, as if sipping anejo rum  and, if I let my mind wander just a bit, perhaps sipping it by the fireplace on a cold fall afternoon, petting the dog beside me, and reading the newspaper. For 8 percent alcohol, theres virtually no booze sting on the tongue  very smooth!

The Yorkshire Stengo is a medium-bodied with a creamy-smooth mouthfeel and a non-cloying semi-dry finish, which is surprising for such a malt-forward ale.

Overall, I found this beer to be skillfully brewed and aged. It is well-balanced and tasty.","Plattsburgh, New York, USA","shawnmurphy"

English Strong Ale? Thats about as helpful a designation as American Strong Ale - which is to say, no bloody use whatsoever. Personally, I call this a barleywine - though its got elements of a quad or abt, as well. Its not overly complex, but I have to say, I enjoy it. It doesnt seem like the combination of sweet dark fruit and almost white wine vinous characteristics would work all that well, but in fact it does. In particular, the tartness on the tongue persists through the finish and stops the toffee malt from becoming mouth-coating or cloying - think christmas pudding with a not-too-sweet lemon sauce.

4317,"2015-10-25",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 11, 2016 Bottle into pint glass. Sweet and alcoholic beer. The sweetness apparently comes from the oak casks used that are more the a century old and used to carry fruit, raisins and treacle toffee. However the more likely reason is the interesting addition of cane sugar. This is probably the reason for its light natural fizz.

Its a dark ruby colour with some natural sediment. The flavour is that of a traditional strong British ale with the added date flavour. It is very pleasant and tasty but I can imagine it getting sickly after a while. The taste is very smiler to dates followed by the strong dry flavour you expect of a beer of this strength.

Very much worth trying and gets you very pleasantly drunk. Giving you a nice warm glow after a single pint. Its perfect for the festive season. 
Score: Aroma 8, Appearance 2, taste 2, Palate 4, Overall 14.
------- Since trying it I have learnt to taste beers better so now having it for a second time Im impressed. It tastes less sweet for some reason, and it has a silky smooth texture. Very nice. Its actually an incredibly beer, with the alcohol perfectly balancing the sweetness. It has a Belgium beer like warmth to it as well.

This was poured into a pint glass.
The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute leaving some light sticky lacing.
The smell had some dark roasty malts with a nice dark coffee and a light dark fruitiness running all over.
The taste was combined through the previously mentioned flavors.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium in body with a fairly decent sessionable aspect about it.

4317,"2014-07-11",3.9,"Barwa: piękna, głęboko miedziana, klarowna. Piana beżowa, drobno pęcherzykowa, dość obfita i trwała oraz ładnie oblepiająca szkło. 

Aromat: owoce czerwone, rodzynki, landrynki, alkohol, może lekkie nuty beczkowe, a nawet wanilia, ale może to już sugestia. 

Smak: zdecydowanie pełny, słodowy (herbatnikowo - karmelowy), umiarkowanie słodki i nieco kwaskowy. Do tego rodzynki i nuta alkoholowa. Występuje chmielowa kontra, ale goryczka najwyżej w okolicach średniej. 

Jest to fermentowane w otwartych kadziach i leżakowane przez rok w dębowych beczkach ""prawdziwe ale"" (refermentowane w butelce). Problem polega jednak na tym, że wspomniane beczki mają ponad 100 lat, zatem nie oddają zbyt wiele nut charakterystycznych dla leżakowanych w ten sposób piw. Barwa i piana są wzorowe. Aromat zdominowany został przez estry, nieco podobne do piw belgijskich. Smak przyjemnie zbalansowany, ale raczej klasyczny, bez szaleństw. Jeśli ktoś lubi ułożone i zbalansowane trunki, o naprawdę pięknej barwie i trwałej pianie powinien być zadowolony. Niestety leżakowanie w beczce niezbyt wpływa na smak i aromat tego piwa i z tego powodu moim zdaniem jego cena nie jest adekwatna do oferowanej jakości.","Z±bki, POLAND","tomekk1978"
4317,"2014-07-09",4.1,"550ml Bottle from Evil Eye Lounge (York - £6.00 approx.):
Strong smelling with good malts & toffee plus a nice alcohol edge to it as well. Plenty of ripe & sweet fruits, oak & vanilla featuring. A good smelling beer with a solid balance & the touches of alcohol only improve things, as does the sweetness from the fruits.

Caramel brown with an inch high, foamy head. Retention is excellent with zero movement over the opening minutes before settling a couple of cm high with nice lacing on the sides.

Again the sweetness kicks things off with some ripe fruits & vanilla plus the oak from the aroma & I could detect bread & malts with a great balance between flavours. The beer is rounded out with some toffee.

Smooth with an alcohol kick but not much bitterness. Some sweetness is present from the start. The balance of this one was good & despite the strength it was quite an easy one to drink.

4317,"2014-06-13",4.1,"When the British (or more usually, the English) wax lyrical about the warm beer of our ""sceptred isle"", this is the pinnacle of the ale in question.

It looks like any number of ""real ales"" served in good pubs up and down the country - brown with a faint hint of ruby, with a small off-white head. Little hop presence so limited immediate aroma, but with warming the aroma of a crisp, brown fruit pudding straight from the oven rises from the glass. Taste is amazing - aforesaid pudding, plums, raisins, toffee, fortified wine, and some herbs.

4317,"2014-05-30",4.1,"I poured a 550ml bottle into an English pint glass. I was brewed in 2010, bottled on 1/28/11 and cost $12.99 ($0.69 per ounce).

Appearance: Ugly rusty brown hue. Completely opaque with no visible carbonation. Pours to a small, beige, foamy head which completely dissipates and leaves no lacing.

Smell: A cornucopia of dark and stone fruits, plus notes of sherry and cider.

Taste: I first had Samuel Smiths Yorkshire Stingo over four years ago when it originally debuted. I havent had it since, though re-watching my review I can tell the flavor profile to the beer has definitely changed over time. Like any good English-style barleywine, old ale or English Strong Ale should, its aged and developed nicely. Im not sure which style category it conforms to, though much like the rest of the brews from Samuel Smiths Brewery, its complex, distinctive and quite enjoyable.

The first thing I notice about the palate is the huge fruit notes. Red apple, plum, fig, raisins, and dark cherry are all prominent flavors right away. I also noticed a strong, sweet flavor of butterscotch, though it faded quickly. Toffee emerges on the finish, along with some dark chocolate, giving it a taste profile similar to that of a barleywine, but not quite as intense. Whatever hop presence this beer originally had has definitely faded, though its not quite carbonated syrup either. In my original review I described it as being very cider-like and acidic, though thats not the case anymore. While still plenty flavorful, Id say the beer definitely peaked some time ago. If you see a bottle in the 2 to 3-year-old vintage Id recommend giving it a try.

Drinkability: Samuel Smiths Yorkshire Stingo definitely has the palate of a strong brew, though the drinking process itself it remarkably easy. The mouthfeel is calm, soft and smooth, but noticeably thick. I was surprised (and a tad disappointed) that the aftertaste finishes mostly clean with just a slight dryness. The 8% ABV gives it significant weight and a minor warming sensation, but at no point is there a distraction.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

The aroma was of a toasted light bread malt and a sweet yeast with hints of caramel, toffee, dark fruit (plums & cherries), a mild odor of oak cask and a light alcohol tinge.

The taste was malty sweet with a touch of caramel and toffee from the get go, progressing with a moderate fruitiness, a hint of oak and a light alcohol finish. The flavor lasted an average time following the swallow, with a nice candi sweet taste left lying on the palate for just a bit longer.

Mouthfeel was almost medium in body with a dry yet syrupy texture and a very soft carbonation.

Overall this was a very tasty and delectable brew. It possessed a very nice balance, which obviously helped in hiding the high ABV that this beer possesses.

Deep caramel color fading into dark brown and supporting a foaming yellow-tinged head.  Taste is much drier than expected, theres raisin-led fruit up front but then the heavy, sludgy waves of treacle, molasses, toffee, caramel swamp everything else but the vanilla and oak fragments, and light yeast.  Gently warming, not a burner or fume-ridden, full-bodied but edging closer to flat.  Seems to be one to let warm above cellar temperature, and a good sipper with a dense and unique malt character and a barrel component that is much classier than usual.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

Aroma is somewhat hard to find... A balance of malt/hops with some banana & butterscotch... hint (HINT) of cinnamon. The flavor is really the highlight of this brew... Oddly balanced light bitter, light sweet, medium sour. Supping releases strong oak and alcohol notes (which I like).

The first thing I get is the faint aroma of Port, or Madeira. That must be from the oak barrels. Not a strong nose, no, especially for something called ""Stingo"". Then it pours chestnut brown, fabulously cloudy. Well, I missed to read the label instructions to pour carefully, but I love the opacity. Still, not much of a head. Coarse and mocha colour, but it wont be a minute before it disappears. Lovely sweet flavour. Malty? Yes, a bit, but honey, syrupy, yeasty and alcoholic as having a few shots of Port and a slice of Brandy-drenched fruitcake in a moist barn. Not a fan of fruitcake per-se, but in the shape of a beer it really works. I love the notes of decaying fruits and the broad finish, sweet, mellow but never overwhelming.

Maybe this could use cellering or something,but at the price i paid-not too impressed. After making my own  oaked english strong ale i thought was bland its pretty comparable to this,and not shure which i thought was better,probably this because the bittering is decent.Its just a kind of bland carmely sweet beer.I guess it is english/comparing it to american strong ales i just think more hop flavor gives strong ales better character to match up the carmel sweetness.

4317,"2011-02-16",3.2,"A vigorous pour into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces a three finger thick, pale amber tinged, tan colored head.  The beer is a dark amber color and, strikingly enough, when held up to the light it is quite hazy and has the same orange-red hue of ruby-red grapefruit juice.  The aroma smells of buttery, vanilla laden oak backed by umami notes that hint at rich aged malt (oxidized, nutty and like a dry sherry).  The nose doesnt smell like it has much sweetness to it.  There even seems to be a touch of tartness to the nose.  The nuttiness seems to accentuate a dry, toasted maltiness, though this is fairly subtle.  I dont know what I was expecting from this beer, but the nose is completely different from what I was expecting.

Somewhat light bodied, quite dry and a bit colder than I would prefer.  The beer finishes with a rich, nutty, sherry-like character that lingers on the palate after my first sip.  There is a hint of bitterness in the finish as well as a touch of spiciness (that might be derived from the oak influence).  There is a soft, quite oxidized, toasted maltiness here as well as a spicy flavor that reminds me of Bourbon (the oak influence no doubt).  As the beer warms up a sweet, caramelized note starts to pick up a bit and interacts with the oak to boost a vanillin note in the flavor.  I do like the relatively light texture and body that this beer has, though it is at the expense of a malt richness that could help add some balance to this beer.

Interesting, but not quite where I would have liked.  It could actually use more rich malt character here as the oak really seems to dominate the flavor a bit more than I would prefer.  Not bad, and certainly worth finishing if you are happy with just having a beer; and it is not like this doesnt have some interesting flavors in it though.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

4317,"2011-01-13",4.1,"Brewed in 2009, bottled in 2010, drank in 2011.

Beer was recommended to me by BA Kendo.

Poured into my Dogfish Head oversized snifter. First pour roused a decent inch or so khaki tinted foam, not much staying power very little lacing to speak.  Beer is a hazy copper to light amber in color.

Aroma gives wafts of cherry, dates and plum right upfront.  Then a lot of powdery malt, moss, earthiness.  If you have ever poured boiling or near boiling liquid on slate or stone you know it creates a very tangible aroma, this beer carries that.  So touches of chocolate and tart sour fruit in the back. So port wine and belgian dark ale aroma as it warms.  Very complex and rich.  A bit of cognac with a good swirl as it warms as well.

A surprising bitterness and apparent carbonation upfront, tart cherries, raisin and bittersweet cocoa in the middle with a souring tart and very oaky tannin finish.  There is caramel and toffee upfront too with some touches of grape and a bit of a grassy/hay tone (English Brett?)

This beer has mouthfeel in spades, luscious depth, medium full bodied, oaky tannins that blend with tart characteristics and sweet caramel malts, finishes semi-sweet but balanced with carbonation, alcohol and tannins.

4317,"2010-12-13",3.9,"THOUGHTS: Not at all what I was expecting, but not bad at all. I though it would be a darker beer. It was a little like Olde Suffolk. Hid the alcohol very well. It definitely had that am Smith underlying flavor. I was surprised by the dark bottle, which is rare for Sam Smith beers. Id usually take a Belgian over a Brit beer any day, but this was very nice. It had just enough hops to keep it from being cloying.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a murky, light to medium brown with orangey highlights and a small, off-white head that mostly diminished and left virtually no lacing. It actually looked a little like apple cider. The aroma had moderate to heavy caramel malt; lighter molasses, a hint of hops; raisin, prune, apple, toffee butterscotch, fig, apple cider; and slight alcohol. The flavor got better and better as it warmed. The initial flavor was sweet; while the finish was rather sweet, lightly bitter and slightly sour with a fairly long duration. There was caramel, toffee, raisin, a little alcohol, slight butterscotch, apple cider, prune, slight wood, bitter wood and glimpse of hops. The medium body was slightly syrupy and sticky on the lips with soft yet tingly carbonation and a finish with hints of chalkiness.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

Flavor of warm, sweet oak and caramel, pickled fruit, plum, with a soft finish of vanilla pudding and fig which evolves into tones of aged rum and candied fig, sugared pecan.  Smooth, creamy, yet hardened mouth feel, delicious to sip on.  I was skeptical about the high price of this one but it is really a work of art, one of the finest brews Ive had in awhile.

4317,"2010-12-11",4.5,"Most folks, myself included, probably dont know that Stingo is an older word that means old ale or old beer.  Seems appropriate for this beer, which is apparently aged for an entire year in Samuel Smiths famous Yorkshire Squares.  Im using a goblet for this one tonight, as a special beer deserves a special glass.  Pours a murky and ruddy amber.  Carbonation levels are pretty high, as theres a constant stream of bubbles popping up from the bottom of the glass.  No real head on this beer, just bubbles on the outer rim of the glass.  Aroma is rich, deep, and pungent.  You can really pick out the oak, which adds a nice earth characteristic.  The first taste is simply incredible.  Flavor profile is stunningly complex, with loads of molasses, dark cherry, raisin, oak, and tobacco clamoring for attention on the palate.  This beer has the perfect amount of carbonation to keep the mouthfeel balanced, as the heavy flavor profile and malt profile could easily become syrupy if left alone.  Happily thats not the case here, though the heavy alcohol warmth makes this a sipping beer.  Samuel Smiths has done it again, creating a textbook example of a classic English style  in the case of Yorkshire Stingo, the Old Ale.  Highly recommended.",", Missouri, USA","VengefulOdin"

The aroma is somewhat slight, before revealing some malt sweetness, a slightly oxidized note, some oak, and a slight note of alcohol.  The palate is surprisingly light and subtle in flavor, given the beers gravity.  The palate shows an almost minty oak character in the approach, before showing some residual malt sweetness, and depth-adding alcohol.  Again, the flavors show a level of finesse and subtlety that is surprising from a strong ale.  Hops do not show themselves in terms of aroma, flavor, or noticeable bitterness.  Carbonation is nicely dialed in.  The finish leaves a lingering not of oak, along with a touch of alcohol.

4317,"2010-08-29",3.9,"Hazy brown, her white head fades fast into a thin ringlet. There is no apparent lace to be found nor any remains of her head other than the collar she wears. Thats okay though because an overly ambitious head would just get in the way of her even more overly ambitious nose. Sweet, vinous, fruity, and ripe with dates and raisins. Molasses whispers while cinnamon sugar and brown sugar adorn, unusually so, plums and apricots; fresh jam anyone? Candied sugars, maraschino cherries, and a solid showing of port and sherry character bring me to the old wood she was aged in. Peat brushes my nose and I dip right back in to capture some more; yes indeed, there is a subtle showing of peat and earth behind each sweet and spicy dark fruit port essence of her nose. While her wood-tinged port and sherry notes were in the back of her nose, in her palate they are front and center from first quaff to last. Silky smooth, her body glides across my tongue while coating my lips with plum and apricot. My palate dries almost immediately, creating an insatiable thirst for more, and so I happily oblige. Mixed in with her dry wood notes are cinnamon sticks for added spice even as apricot jam and marmalade slather themselves atop dry toast while raspberries and black plums tantalize. Nothing lingers but an apparent dryness of breath which reminds me of supping an old red wine or old woody port. The more we acquaint ourselves, the more I come to the conclusion that within her complexity, she is a rather simple beer made exquisite by how well her major flavor profiles work together for the ultimate in sessionable barrel-aged beer quaffing.


I can and will easily recommend this beer to anyone looking for a good sit down session where your mind, body, and soul are in that perfect medium of not too much and not too little.

Served on the high side of cellar temperature. This is one good-looking beer; pours a beautiful red-brown with a modest and coarse/short-lived head but abundant lacing and a long-lasting rim of foam around the edge of the glass. Theres a tremendous amount going on in the aroma: apples and dates, old wine barrels and oak, toffee. Flavor is drier than anticipated given the aroma, but by no means bone dry; instead, we get an interesting blend of sourness (more in the brown ale vein than the sour ale vein) and damp old oak with dark dried fruits and sherry, any earthy bitterness closing the whole thing out. Enjoyable mouthfeel, certainly not hot nor particularly thick, but quite fulfilling once the palate adjusts expectations.

4317,"2009-12-15",4.1,"Appearance: Pours a near clear, dark amber-hued ody with a medium-small, bubbly, off-white head.

Smell: A nose of caramel-coated, toasted biscuit tops provide a nice sweet-smelling scent accented by notes of dried fruits and spicy English hops. 

Taste: Begins with a taste of sweet, luscious caramel with a deep, dark sugary tone to it along with some lightly toasty biscuit hints and a notable fruitiness coming across as raisins and dehydrated apricots ready for the trail mix bag. Mild spiciness and bitterness from the English hops. Only a minor perceived woody character seems to have been imparted by the oak staves. A bit mineral-laden on the back half. Theres a little leftover malt sweetness on the otherwise lightly spicy finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Just a skosh above medium carbonation.

Drinkability: Not bad! Its quite good, in fact, though, at the price tag of around eleven bucks per bottle (the real source of the sting-o), I dont see myself returning to it anytime soon.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

The oak barrels really come through in this beer, loads of aged, dark sugars, roasted caramels, wood and tons of booze.  Very hard on the senses, overload of taste, smell and feel.

4317,"2009-11-23",3.5,"Dark reddish amber with a pretty big and thick pale beige head with a surprisingly good retention. Nice lacings stick along.

A somewhat edgy, yet also round smell. Noticeable spiciness and stingy mix of alcohol and a hint of vinegar. But underneath this edgy character lies a beautiful and smooth malty foundation of dark bread, caramel, fudge and coco powder. Rich cherry-like fruitiness, raisins and nuts. The composition of rich sweet aromas and hints of tartness is definitely interesting, but I dont know if its all together successful.

A pleasant taste, but still hard to really get a grip on. The maltiness is dense and has a rather bready character. Caramel, fudge and some chocolate notes delivers much of the sweetness. Plenty of nutty aromas. Vinous fruits (cherries, red apples). The sweetness is balanced by a rather noticeable tart note, which is actually quite surprising but very pleasant. The beer has distinct ""aged"" character and it is obvious that is has been barrel aged (dusty cellar, some wet wood and that general taste of oak barrel). In the finish, there is a mild bitterness and a prominent taste of alcohol. Raisins, some herbs and spices rounds it off.

Medium body with a smooth texture. Initially, the carbonation is a little bit too much, but it settles nicely.

Not bad at all, but its not excellent. From such a great brewery I think I would have expected more, but still recommended.

The flavor profile is malty with caramel and some tropical fruit. A very interesting combination for an English Ale. I also get some vanilla which likely comes from the barrel aging. This also has an very rich, creamy mouthfeel.

The beer pours pumpkin candle orange with a small head that disappears quickly.  It smells sweet and oaky, like an old rocking chair at your grandmothers house.  There are some nice earth and fruit notes lingering in the aroma as well.  It reminds me of a Jolly Pumpkin beer, more in the aroma than the flavor but both have that same pervasiveness, almost overwhelming oak note that I associate with JPs beers (and I say that with nothing but affection for oaky beers, particularly JPs).  Of course, Stingo doesnt really seem to have been soured at all.  The flavor is still quite dry, but there are hints of caramel malt pushing through.  It tastes mostly of fruit and oak.  The fruit flavors are citric, cider-y and a bit floral in a fruit-ish way.    Its an excellent beer and Im happy to have found myself a bottle.

4317,"2009-09-26",4.0,"Brewed in 2008; Tasted September 25, 2009.  Never imagined I would see this style sitting on a shelf in Minneapolis.  Murky orange color with a medium head that quickly vanishes.  Big aroma of nuts, fruits (pear in particular) and a little bit of the musty cellar character common in Normandy ciders.  The flavors start with a dry breadiness, raisins and yeast levels like a Belgian ale.  Thick and chewy malt, yet very carbonated.  A faint hint of the oak is there after it warms a bit, along with biscut and some spice.  After getting close to room temp, I could have sworn I could taste stone, like the smell of granite or limestone just smashed apart.  Really surprising brew that I wish was more easily (and cheaply) available.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"

Body is a bit thin, I suppose, but its certainly not too far off the mark for the style. Theres a nice malt presence to tie everything together, a sweet and chewy core, but the oak and dessert wine really do dominate.

Subtly rich and refreshing at the same time. Really nice stuff.Particularly coming from a non-geeky brewery, the price can be off-putting at first, but  the price is on par with many similarly-made concoctions.

The smell features lots of darker malt sweetness--much like molasses or maple syrup.

Not as sweet as the smell suggests, but thats because theres a solid dose of hop in the finish.  Thick and slightly oily (from the alcohol).  Lots of stone fruit flavors, particularly plum. The aftertaste has a mild sourness mixed in with the malt sugar and bittering hop balance.

An endless aftertaste offers cherry, pine, and alcohol sting... and eventually evolves into honey, lemon, and anise.

4317,"2008-12-23",3.5,"<i>Bottled at Monks Café Wallingatan, Stockholm. </i> Clear brownish amber, really rich firm head. Rich oaky vinous nose. Fairly sweet with strong flavour of gooseberries, yeast and oak. Well rounded caramelly malt gives wa yfor notes of black currant, oak and syrup. Finishes with fairly low bitterness. An attention grabber with its very direct flavour - more American brashness in its approach than British subtlety.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"

Lots happening in the flavour with plenty of fruit, hop and malt balanced with an unobtrusive woodiness and a hint of spice that works really well. A top notch English brew, and definitely one to look for again.","Wirral, Merseyside, ENGLAND","wyzzywyz22"

Rotting dark berries. Dry woody palate, fruity too. Interesting carbonation - it feels both flat and well carbonated. Alcohol sometimes present, but that often hides behind the big esters that are to the fore. Big wood too.

A slight sourness mingles with a sweet toffee nose there is also a little bit of Dundee cake there as well. Very nice in the mouth, quite soft with melting bubbles.

The aroma is  a stunning balance of lovely English hops and full on strawberry jam and so much other preserve fruit along with some gorgeous caramel notes. Flavour... bloody hell! Lovely hops, equally lovely malt, loads of alcohol (but still manageable), caramel and toffee with a good bitter finish. Done to perfection and not at all over the top. US brewers, take note, this is how you barrel age. Excellent stuff.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
