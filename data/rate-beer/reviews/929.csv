929,"2017-06-17",2.8,"Pour is a cloudy yellow with a large white head. Aroma is a nice pils bready malt and a big lemony hop. Flavor is a little bit thinner than the aroma let on. You still get a decent bready malt with the hops its just a little watery. I dont think being brewed in the California Common style added anything to the beer. It is a solid pils though.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
