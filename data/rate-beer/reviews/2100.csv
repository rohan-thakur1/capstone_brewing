2100,"2013-03-05",4.0,"500ml bottle from The Real Ale Warehouse, drunk today. Light gold, clear. Pours thick, fluffy white head, which lasts very well. Good lacing. Mid-light carbonation. Aroma - Very fresh, very zesty grapefruit & a bit of sweeter citrus (tangerine). Lots of juicy, aromatic citrus rind oil. Very fresh, tangy & clean-smelling, and grassy. Also a touch of floral-ness & some lemon. Fresh hop oil - bit spicy. Behind that, a nice, crisp, cereal-ish, grainy, unobtrusive pale malt. Lovely, complex, but citrus-dominated aroma, that isnt OTT or perfumey; just appetising. Taste - Balanced & light, with lot of citrus. Very lightly sweet, cereally pale malt: Fairly standard pale malt body, for a blond ale; bit understated, malt is inoffensive & very much secondary to the aromatic, dry citrus flavours. Quite a lot of citrus flavours going on, but perhaps unsurprisingly, they dont quite live up to the intense aroma, though still good. Lemon, sweet grapefruit & grass. Lightly bitter hops. Bit of floral. Lightly dry, lightly bitter finish, with some dry citrus zest flavours left on the tongue, leaving you wanting more. Light body, with a bit of creaminess for mouthfeel.

2100,"2011-08-31",3.7,"In short: A clean and crisp blonde ale with a fresh and grassy and citrusy hop character.  Very good thirst beer
How: From a bottle at Mondial de la Bière 2011
The look: Clear blonde body topped by a small white head
In long:  The moderately hoppy nose is grassy and citrusy.  Body is crisp pale malts, crisp half-dry hay sensation.  The hopping is a bit mostly dried yellowed grass and some citrus fruits.  Bitterness level is in the medium range and the finish has a nice dryness.  Pleasant clean and crisp mouthfeel.  Similar to Fynes own Avalanche and Hurricane Jack except that Jarl is more dry grass and more tasty than the other two.  Even if Jarl was the most intense of the three I still preferred the other two (especially Avalanche) because they felt even more refreshing and beers that I could drink 8 gallons of (instead of only 7 gallons of the Jarl).  Ive had only three beers from this brewery and they were all very good, I need to try more.  I need a quick answer from someone, what are the best Fyne Ales, where can I buy them and also what is the right religion?","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2100,"2011-06-15",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 16, 2011 500ml bottle from Mondial private imports. 

Appearance : Perfectly clear pale yellow with a nice white head. Some lacing. Nice head retention.

Aroma : Powerful (for the abv) dry hop. Great floral notes with herbal hints. Very fresh and leafy hops. Great malty background too. Can smell my glass a foot away. 

Taste : Awesome leafy and floral hops. Light fruity passion fruits notes. Finish is quite malty with lots of hops. A bit piny and resinous but mostly floral and leafy. Finish is sharp and crisp with some bitterness. 

Palate : Carbonation is quite fizzy but its not harsh nor aggressive.

Overall : Wow very good stuff. 3 months later and this is still very impressive. Awesome hops with great malt. Very flavorful for such low abv. Extremely refreshing and quite drinkable. Great fruity finish. Stunning !

Bottled sample at Mondial 2011. 

Appearance : Clear yellow with a small head.

Aroma : Crisp malt with nice herbal hops. Nice notes of hay.

Taste : Great malt with citrusy and herbal hops. Finish is very malty with hay. Nice fruits, nice bitterness.

Palate : Soft carbonation, quaffable.

Overall : Very refreshing and drinkable. As impressive as Hurricane Jack even more since this one has half a point less abv. Really clean and sharp. Very elegant and I wish I could sample this by the pint... June 15th 2011 8,3,8,4,16;3.9","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

2100,"2011-06-09",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 29, 2016 My Bottom Line:
Crisp and balanced, this snappy Golden Ale seduces through its spicy, herbal and citrusy hops dallying in a lean and bubbly mouthfeel not unlike a good Kellerbier.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A foam mushroom laces atop the very pale blond.
-Malts provide haystack allusions, perfect to support the judicious hoppiness.
-This was obviously very drinkable and satisfying as a session beer.
-This is as absolutely lovely served from a cask as it is from the bottle, although both mouthfeels are obviously different. Great job Fyne Ales!

2100,"2011-02-07",3.0,"A straw yellow pour with a mostly diminishing head.  The nose is of fresh hops, very citric indeed; theres a honey-heavy maltiness here and then some dank yeast which brings a welcomed complexity.  However, in the mouth the hops turn a regrettable corner by abandoning the floral notes of the aroma and falling too completely into the yeast character.  This impacts the malts which seem a bit too sharp for the rest of it: in a word, unbalanced.  The mouth feel is slick with a low carbonation.  It finishes on the malts and brings back a hint of the hops - but not enough.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","theSlipperyPen"
