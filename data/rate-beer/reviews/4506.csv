4506,"2010-06-01",3.5,"750ml, bottle 321-10.  The pour yields a clear, dark, reddish to brassy amber colored body.  A small, smooth, beige colored head settles in quickly to a thin, patchy film that leaves skinny, snake-like flares behind.  The aroma shows a bevy of sweet caramel, bread, and plum notes, combining with some wintery spice notes to evoke a very fruitcake-like profile.  Its a little doughy, and somewhat boozy overall.  Flavors show a little oxidized dryness, hinting at fruited bread or cake that is a few days old.  Caramelized sugars and figgy, plummy, dried fruits are prevalent. Medium bodied, at least for what I expect an Eisbock to show, the oxidation is actually kind of nice as it dulls and dries out the sweetness to a nice level.  I dont know that I could differentiate this from a standard doppelbock, really.  Good brew, but not great.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Pours a murky brown color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of malts, nuts and dark fruit. The flavor is strong caramel malt with some more nuttyness and dark fruits. Light mouthfeel and medium carbonation. There is some alcohol in the flavor, but not near as much as you would expect in an 11 percent beer.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
