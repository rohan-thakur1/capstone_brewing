The grassiness/herbs/flowers are slightly overbearing, but nevertheless its neat.","Kraków, POLAND","JtanK"

3748,"2016-08-22",4.4,"De la colaboración entre Schneider Weisse(GER) y Brooklyn Brewery(U.S.A) esta Meine Hopfenweisse (TAP 5) una cerveza Weizenbock de estilo base con 8.2% de alcohol pero lupulada como si se tratara de un estilo americano, Schneider Weisse es considerada una de las mejores cervecerías fabricantes de cervezas de trigo, muchas de sus etiquetas están en un rango de calificación por este beer de 90 a 100, esta cerveza colaborativa es una de ellas, con 99 en estilo y 98 en el general, el estilo básicamente es una Wissen fuerte(ya sea obscura o clara) combinada con el cuerpo de una Bock o en este caso una Doppelbock por el contenido alcohólico, los lúpulos americanos en esta cerveza serán un distintivo único ya que no es algo común y el perfil generalmente debe ser maltoso con las propiedades de la levadura fenolica, vamos a probar esta particular Wissenbock.
En apariencia tiene una corona de espuma cremosa, abundante y duradera, de perlas compactas a amplias muy cristalinas, el liquido tiene un increíble tono dorado claro con bastante turbiedad que causa destellos hacia tonalidades naranjas, la carbonatación que se puede apreciar es media, el cuerpo en las paredes del cristal es pleno y deja marca.
En el aroma es única, de inicio se aprecia una buena cantidad de lúpulos, dando notas a lima limón que no es tan común, mandarina, toronja, ligeramente frutal como a durazno, piña y platano, especias son perceptibles, predominantemente coriandro, las maltas tambien son evidentes y el trigo arroja du carácter.
En el sabor a diferencia de cualquier cerveza de trigo alemana destaca primero el lúpulo dando aspectos florales a lima limón que es raro pero no es desagradable, mandarina, durazno, en menor medida herbal, platano tambien se aprecia pero ya lo aporta la levadura y la malta, el sabor del grano aunque no esta en primer plano su sabor no esta tan alejado en intensidad a el lúpulo y nos brinda un dulzor para sacar adelante el amargor, hay especias presentes como coriandro que le da cierta frescura, el alcohol llega a estar presente en el paladar y lengua pero no aporta calor en la garganta, el retrogusto es duradero y cítrico, alcohólico que cierra muy bien, una cerveza única y compleja, que tiene bien merecida su califiicacion en Ratebeer.","MEXICO","Yased"

Looks: Cloudy hazy straw golden honey colour with a lots of yeast particles; Two finger head with crumpety white foam which lasted for 3 minutes; Very good sticky lacing and quite active carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragment malt, with strong fresh pineapple, light passion fruits, banana, vanilla, light metallic, caramel, strong wheat and tartness, honey, sugar, strong cloves, cinnamon, spices, strong yeast, lemon and light grass. The nice aroma can be smelt from a foot away.

Taste: Strong sweet moderate malt, with strong pineapple, strong honey, strong molasses, moderate wheaty tartness, strong caramel, light cloves, strong spices, strong yeast, strong lemon, quite strong bitter hops and sharp grass. Wow!

Body: Close to medium body. Slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Pretty strong maltyness in a thick and smooth body. Lots of pineapple ester and honey here as if this is a Heller Bock. Wheatyness is here but took a backseat. Tastable spices, good yeastiness and strong lemon to round. Exciting!

Hoppiness: Strong honey, strong cinnamon and spices, strong lemon and sharp grass in nose and taste; Bitterness is quite strong for a lasting, high astringent sweet-bitter finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Fruity, nice sweet and bitter to mouth.

Comments: This is a totally different beast from Tap 6 Aventinus, but just as brilliant: refreshing pineapples and strong honey aroma and taste, coupled with nice clovey spice, sweetness, solid body and maltyness, and a head strong hoppiness which have you think this is Heller Bock, Marzen and IPA being rolled into one.

I get notes of banana, clove, coriander, caradamom, vanilla, guava, loquats and custard apple. German noble hop, herbal, touches with lots of what and bready malts in the backbone. Some bubblegum and a fresh hint of spearmint. Otherworldly. It doesnt get more complex than this without losing balance. Complex fruity and semi-bitter taste. Explosive spiciness in the tongue. Banana and oher ripe fruits like peaches and apricots start unleashing more massive biscuit and cake flavors that show what a massive malty backbone this brew has. Intense but without a trace of booze. Strong, bold retronasal. Medium body but I cannot stress enough how drinkable it is for and 8,2% ABV. Medium carbonation. Incredible.

From the first sip you get a big hit of alcohol. The alcohol dulls whatever other flavours may be there. Strong banana and bubblegum aroma. When I poured the rest of the beer into the glass it was a really dirty muddy brown colour but it eventually settled and cleared.

Wow, incredibly inviting. After yeast deposit, beer almost turns dark, and carrot juice becomes more pronounced. T: delicately balanced fruitiness here as well. The bitter elements of each of the fruits is more pronounced, however. Starts with a sweet fruity taste that is borderline fabricated, this improves after the yeast is poured into the glass, fruitiness is really well balanced then. Develops quite an intense bitterness where the bitter tastes from pineapple, kiwi and grapefruit,-all combined in one big amalgam-, hit the palate.

I was sceptical about the prospects for this beer, but I should have known that a brewery like Schneider knows what they are doing and was pleasantly surprised.

Glowing, slightly hazy, golden color with a decent head.

Offers up a fantastic nose, exhibiting floral notes, slightly herbal grass, clove and a ripe fruitiness of banana and orange peel. Grassy hops are well recognizable among a note of honey and bready yeast. Quite complex and intriguing.

Has a perfectly fitting medium carbonation with a smooth mouthfeel to it, thanks to the pleasantly present yeast.

Tastes of bread, leavy hops and a honey sweetness, balanced by a refreshing, medium hop bitterness. Its fruity flavors blend very well into slightly warming honey and biscuity malts, while the hops really amp up the whole character of the beer, pushing it gently into a floral bitterness, without denying its initial flavors. Finishes sweeter, with honey infused yeast smoothness among pepper and dried orange, hiding its higher abv perfectly.

3748,"2015-04-19",5.0,"Honestly my ultimate beer. There is so much going on here. Its the absolute marriage between what we love in IPAs and Hefeweissen- big hoppy citrus notes coupled with all the sweet bubble gum goodness of a hefeweissen.

Big frothy white head that goes away at a slow rate. The aroma is sublime, with so much nuance. I detect citrus (almost pineapple), floral, fruity notes, with yeasty stuff coming out too. With the hefeweissen hybrid you also get some banana and bubblegum in there too. The taste is equally complex with an excellent balance between the sweetness from the hefeweissen wheat and the bitterness from the heavy hops in the IPA portion of this mind blowing hybrid.Mouthfeel is super smooth with an excellent balance of CO2, its a thick fizzy beer with a long amazing finish.

3748,"2014-09-07",4.1,"Transfer from BA review on 4-7-13-

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance- The beer pours a golden amber color with a two finger white head. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time to leave a nice level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is fruity and bold. The heaviest aroma is that of a more citrus nature, being heaviest of orange and tangerine, but also having notes of grapefruit hop and a bit of lemon. Mixed with the citrus, are other fruit aromas of banana as well as some apple and pear. There is a slight yeasty and bready aroma with some smells of spice. A candy like sugar aroma is also present there as well producing an overall aroma that reminds me of a fruit roll-up. Quite a delicious smell.

 Taste  The taste begins with a wheaty and citrus sweet flavor with strong flavors of orange. Other fruit flavors of banana and apple come to the tongue with more breadiness coming along as well. Toward the middle and the end, the yeast and spice that was detected in the nose also come to the tongue. More toward the end some of the sweeter flavors begin to fade however and a somewhat funky and hay like flavor come to the tongue with an intensification of the yeast as well as some bitter grapefruit joining along. In the end a slightly barnyard, but heavily citrus and wheaty flavor is left onto linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is average to a little thinner for a brew of 8.2 % abv with a carbonation level that is on the slightly above average side. The lower body and higher carbonation are quite appropriate for the wheaty, citrus and funky flavors of the brew and make it quite a drinkable and enjoyable feel overall.

 Overall - A rather nice brew that drinks much easier then it should (in light of its 8.2 % abv and more saision like funky flavor)s. It is a rather good drinker and one to try if you get a chance.","","Darkmagus82"

Powerful aroma of orange peel, red apple, cinnamon, brown bread, cinnamon, floral hops, soap, banana, yeast, liqueur, vanilla and some oxidation which does not disturb me here. Soft fruity taste (apple, apricot, banana), creamy mouthfeel with soft carbonation, yeasty with some wheat sourishness, bready and caramelly malts, supple, light spiciness in the finish with emphatic flowery hops without actually bittering, some liqueurish alcohol and powdery, fruity, dry yeastiness. Wonderful beer, another one to support Schneiders good reputation.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
3748,"2014-09-02",4.5,"Uber-cloudy, golden yellow, then copper at the thick parts. One finger of unstable head. Looks completely legit. An expert pour by me leaves a symphony of floating sediment.

One whiff: wow. Heavy orange rind and earthy cloves. Spicy grains of paradise. The spiciness is tempered by a succulent citrus aroma: tangerine, blood orange, pineapple. Lemon Pledge. Absolutely exploding with aromatics. [Ed. note: not literally]

Flavors are more spicy, prickly flavors; rye bread. Buffered by more citrus (lemon, orange peel, pineapple, tangerine) and coriander. Its challenging! The hops kind of take a backseat, but they are there, adding a serious citrus/American hop to an otherwise very European beer.

Feels prickly and tingly. It really dances beautifully on the palate. This beer is tremendous. I havent had it (or its American iteration) in many years, and Im surprised how much I still enjoy it as much as the first time I had it.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

Der Einstieg ist vielfältig: eine Süsse, Hefe und Hopfen vermischen sich mit - diplomatisch ausgedrückt - der Vollmunidkeit. Der Kritikpunkt meinerseits ist die Alkoholstärke. Die Überstrahlt den Geschmack und macht für mich dieses Bier kaum trinkbar ausser zu sehr deftigen Mahlzeiten, in dem ich wiederum nicht so ein Regenbogen der Würzgeschmäcker wünsche. Körper und Abgang sind ebenso viellfältig und für mich fliesst hier auch wieder die 8,2% negativ ein.

Really sweet and fruity flavor with pine, ripe banana, wheat, some cloves and red apples, and quite a lot of toffee initially and later cookies and bread. Drier finish with more pronounced banana and banana peel, plus vanilla, orange, hay, sweet caramel and some clove and grass.

3748,"2014-08-25",3.7,"Reviewed from notes. 
This was poured into a weizen glass. 
The appearance was a bronzed /somewhat golden yellow color with a big lush white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute leaving some really nice looking semi - thick lacing sticking all over. 
The smell had a nice banana esters with clove, and orange peel. Some light coriander comes as well. 
The taste was mainly sweet but also a nice element of spice. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was there but nothing overbearing. Theres a nice spiciness rolling over my tongue. 
Overall, I say this was a pretty good weizenbock that I could have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Strong banana & spice with faint alcohol. Background citrus & mango, orange & light hops too.. Fruity & fresh with good balance, some yeast & cloves. Nice stuff.

Cloudy orange to amber with foamy, 3cm white head that held steady until I took a sip.

Banana & cloves to start with faint alcohol. Citrus, mango & pineapple with background hops & grassy flavours feature, as does some bubblegum.

Creamy with a smooth feel & medium body helped down with moderate carbonation. The beers alcohol content was noticeable but the fruits in the taste helped mask at least some of it.

A good beer and one that benefited from the extra hops in both the taste and smell. Whilst it was a pleasant beer I think Id be put off buying it all that often based on the fact that it is a lot stronger and harder to get a hold of that several other German wheat beer.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

3748,"2014-06-26",3.8,"Mellow citrus and apricot smell, very fruity. It has some light chicory or citrus pulp smell, very attractive. Nice medium fine white had, dark golden color, misty. The foretaste is very sweet and malty, and has strong blood orange pulp aroma/taste. The mouth feel is pretty bold, feels like having some salty taste (which make it sweeter). Aftertaste is sweet and light bitter (hops bitter), the salt still left in mouth. I feel tension on mouth skin, feel dry. When I have more sip, I feel it has some pine (which normally comes with citrus aroma, from hops) aroma, and in the middle it shows lemon acid and caramel malty (chicory and malty, which give a hint of barley wines characteristic). So basically there are 3 flavor/aroma string. One is citrus pine hoppy with malty sweet, this is like a double IPA. Two is salty lemon sour mix with apricot pulp aroma, this feels like a Gose. Third is chicory malty which feels like a thin barley wine. Its quite interesting. Its a Germay ale, dry hopped (which make it not very bitter, but still very hoppy). The strong malty thing just shows its double bock style. The Gose is actually another German beer style, so I think it also inherited some recipe from that. Quite interesting, enjoyable. I think I should serve it even color ( I drink it at about 11 degree C). Mouth feel is very creamy (from salt?). Its also has lots of sediment at bottom.","San Mateo, California, USA","diamondtin"

3748,"2014-05-04",4.7,"Pours a hazy orange with a big white head that dissipates relatively quickly. Aroma is dominated by hops: floral, resin and herbs, with slight hints of banana from the weiss yeast. Flavor profile is also dominated by hops, with really nice floral hop flavor at beginning, followed by a medium sweetness, finishing with a pleasant, citrus and herby hop character that lingers for a while. Light-medium body, with an oily texture, average to fizzy carbonation, and a relatively dry, bitter finish. 

Overall, the hop clearly dominates this beer, with only slight hints of its weissbier roots. Really a fantastic beer. One of my favorites so far.","NETHERLANDS","Mainuh_man"

Orange, cloudy body, with a big, creamy, lacing, off-white head.
Simply perfect, unique and complex aroma of citrus, ripe fruits, dried fruits, ripe banana, apricot, mango, red apples, flowers, vanilla, some spices, subtle alcohol and so much more.
Taste follows this, also amazingly complex and smooth, with a bit more alcohol.
Medium, silky mouthfeel, with an average carbonation.
Finishes alcohol warming, smooth, sweet, spicy, very fruity again, hoppy.

It dont has to be a super rare, over-the-top brew, this is one of my all time favourite beers! An accomplished, inspiring, unique style example like no other. Strong, but so smooth to drink and most of all a dense, complex fruit bomb. Creamy Weizenbock aromas and loads of aromatic hops in a perfect balance and even the (not too overpowering) alcohol fits in perfectly. Especially the nose is one of the most characteristic things Ive experienced so far since Im into quality beers and every time Im drinking this, I discover some new aroma.

The aroma is yeasty bubblegum, light spicy cloves & subtle citrusy hops. Medium-light body with a slick mouthfeel. The taste is an intriguing mix of spicy weizen notes counterbalanced by hops.

3748,"2014-01-11",3.9,"Bottle 500 ml at home, into a ig weizen glass. ABV 8.2%
Dark orange colour on the body, with the typical haziness of a weizen, with tiny yeast particles floating around. Huge head, four fingers tall, white in colour. Very thick and soapy, with excellent retention. Spots of lacing left around the glass.
Initial aroma is yeast but after the thick head has collapsed, more aromas manage to surface. Spices, and not just the usual clove of a weizen, less yeast now but still there, very fruity with notes of peaches, apricots, some hops and floral notes too. Really complex.
Taste is sweet, on a tolerable level, with lots of spices again. The apricots more notable now, the peaches are following. The alcohol is very well hidden, in no case I could guess this is a 8.2% ABV beer. Malts on the finish and little grass.

The aroma is a delightful, rich combination of tropical fruitiness  peach, apricot and orange  with wheaty maltiness and spiciness. Taste is very hoppy and spicy, also a bit sour. Initial light sweetness lasts until hops take over. Hops add plenty of bitterness but it complements rather than overshadows the usual wheat beer maltiness and estery fruitiness  this is rich in everything  malts, hops and yeast  and somehow still manages to seem balanced.

Aroma contains light malts (dark bread, molasses), moderate hops (flowers, orange zest, lemon, lime) and banana, grape, raisin, pineapple, honey, vanilla, licorice and cola.
Flavor is light acidic, then sweetness is added and finally bitterness comes in the mix. finish is light astringent. 
Body is medium with creamy texture and soft carbonation.

3748,"2013-07-28",3.8,"Bottled September 13, 2013.
Appearance: The body is an ugly murky burnished golden, showing bright on the edges. The head is tall and dense with great retention, forming a creamy light tan coating. Despite the ugly color this still looks wonderful.
Aroma: Bright apple, cherry and pear come to mind with bready and chalky notes and a touch of cloves. There are some sharp either esters or carbonation that comes off a little off-putting.
Taste: The intro is malty with some peppery spice and hints of clove throughout. Apples become apparent on the mid-taste though alcohol is present, like a high alcohol cider. Deep caramel and brown sugar notes make an appearance on the finish. This is malty and fruity, but a little rough. Still very enjoyable.
Palate: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, coming off a touch sharp.
Overall: This isnt the best weizenbock Ive had, but its darn good. The alcohol comes through a touch, but I love the fruity notes throughout.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

update: some pineapple can also be felt both in the aroma and taste. Im really close to say that (at least currently) I cant imagine that it is possible to brew better weizen than this one. score changed from 4.9 (10/5/9/5/20) to 5.0 - if I find better weizen in the future, then Ill re-score it again :)

3748,"2013-07-13",4.0,"50cl bottle from Liebick Getränke in Germering.

A  Cloudy burnt orange, lots of sediment, with a 2 finger white head that clings to the glass leaving sheets of lacing.

S  Peach puree, mango, clove, sweet malt, honey, banana, just a barrage of rich fruit aromas.

T  Big dose of fruity wheat. tangy banana, peaches, lemons, citrus meld with a sweet pilsner malt. Citrus and floral hops stick to the tongue on the finish.

M  Rich and creamy feel, full bodied.

Big yeast presence and just the right amount of hops. Very soft feel and delicious. Zero alcohol presence. Great summertime beer.

Pours a golden orange with slight white foam. Last half inch of beer in bottle shaken with the yeast to produce a very foamy (brownish gray) cap on top. Yeast clouds the beer quickly to a nice hazy orange. Aromas are surprisingly subtle. Looking for banana/clove but only finding a trace. More of a caramel with citrus/pine cone effect from dry hop. Still very nice. Head falls quickly, and aromas fade with it.  Subtlest bitterness in a predominantly sweet taste with a hint of sour.  No alcohol heat despite higher ABV so great balance.

3748,"2012-12-23",4.7,"50 ml. bottle purchased @ biernavigatie.nl. Price was very agreeable as it is usually the case with this German beers & Schneider has a solid reputation plus their Avinitus is one hell of beer. Drank @ home, poured into my Molen tasting glass because I dont use it nearly enough. The beer was bottled on 03.02.2012  BBF 03.02.2013. This is unfortunately a tad bit past its prime but luckily still good according to the brewer. Pours a more or less apple golden with a white disappearing head. Smell is sweet banana, corn, yeast, light sugar, spices, light cloves and some light citrus (almost an American hop like touch), wow this was quite a lovely surprise. This must be even lovelier fresher. Taste is a sweet blend of banana, corn pure & slightly floral spices, some closes, light citrus in the back of the sweetness, very soft wheat, light citrus, cornstalks, natural sugar and a big portion of chewy bubblegum. Very easy to drink with still a substantial banana body, quite creamy with a fitting carbonation. Goes down very easy & smoothly. Quite a lovely surprise and an excellent beer, one of the finest brews I have had so far from Germany. I assume that this is the first authentic Weizen Bock I try, either way I have some difficulties classifying this style because every time I try a different one, it is a completely different kind of brew from the previous one. Either way this beer is absolutely lovely & wouldnt mind to check out a fresher bottle. This is brilliant stuff.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

3748,"2012-10-31",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 10, 2012 .5l on tap and served in a Schneider Weisse tulip glass at Weisses Bräuhaus in central Munich. 
This cloudy beer has a well proportioned, near white head that is very durable and leaves exceptional sticky lacing.  The aroma is remarkably hoppy ... for a European beer. There is a clear weisse beer base with a strong hop presence: a hop component like an Amer. IPA. Lots of orange in the nose!
The flavor is a bit different, with much less hop presence than in the nose. It is a bit more sweet than bitter, even in the finish. Still a strong citrus flavor; mainly orange. Yeasty too. A complex mix of diverse flavors that are really well integrated. 

Exceptionally smooth feel with no harshness whatsoever. Medium body.

The flavour profile for this unusual Weisse is spectacular by conservative German standards: sweet with citrus overtones, malty-sweet body with an almost sharp/aggressive amount of upfront soapy hops and chewing gum: altogether somewhat unbalanced (cloudy, sharp simcoe? hop profile) and boozy (bottle does say ""Weizenstarkbier 8,2%""), which makes it harder on the stomach. Heard this used to be more balanced and impressive but this beer still sticks out by any bland German Weizen standard...// rerates 2013-2014: grows on me depending on mood & occasion: either very soapy, pollenlike, flowery or very balanced: the batches and/or storing methods on its meandering distribution paths seem to diverge..

Some clove flavor, notes of tangy wheat grain, plum, pears, and some more fruity banana esters on the finish. Palate is full, slick and creamy like any wheat-based beer should be.

That one was very good, kind of like a hefeweizen with everything tuned up to 11. That is what I expected of the Tap 5 as well, but it turns out that this is a different creature all together! The murky orange body is filled with particles of all sizes and doesnt look that great. The head is large, consists of creamy rocks of white foam that quite quickly reduces to a long-lived layer that laces the glass well. A very strong aroma with yeast, spices, perfume, sweet fruits (the banana is a bit fainter than expected, pineapple is more evident). The taste is moderate sweet and hey, a moderate bitter finish! Thats a new one! It really backs up the syrupy sweetness in a nice way. Strong flavours with lots of hoppy, yeasty and malty notes. Its fruity, but hardly any banana. Also spices. The most dominant elements however are things Ive never picked up in a beer before! Is that blue cheese? And capers? Or is that anchovies? Olives? Que? I guess what Im trying to say is that this is quite unusual, but extremely interesting! The mouthfeel is perfect: the beer is full-bodied, the texture is syrupy and the carbonation is moderate.

Taste: Surprisingly close to the aroma yet much like a hefe. Its quite orangey bittersweet which is interesting. 40 IBU? Sure doesnt seem it but thats probably because its pretty well balanced.

Aroma: The nose is rather wheaty, with a spice component, some grass, and a mix of fruity notes

3748,"2011-09-25",3.2,"This is one of those brews I always wanted to do a homebrew version of but was afraid to waste the fermenter space on a possible disaster. I am always glad when commercial breweries take these risks so that I dont have to. Its a strong German wheat, hopped up like an IPA and it tastes surprisingly similar to what you might expect. The nose is a mix of hefty banana notes with a strong whiff of herbal hops. The juicy texture of the weizenbock meshes reasonably well w/ the firm hop bitterness but it does give you kinda the sensation that someone accidentally mixed two very different beers. This is a strong beer and you can tell, it drinks almost like a barleywine due to the wheaty thickness and burns a little bit on the way down. The slight acidity and prickly carbonation are a nice tough but I am still really glad that I never wound up w/ five gallons of something like this on my hands.

But one can tell the wheat easily beyond the hops. Good stuff and drinkable, but I dont really like hops in my weisse. They make it kind of too sweet. Neither did this pair with my homemade hamburger very well. Adding the yeast does not make this better, only kills the freshness.","Tampere, FINLAND","laiti"

Flavor is also distinctly hoppy (more citrus and spice) with additional notes of tangy wheat, caramel, and sticky fruit.  Not very bitter despite the strong hoppiness.

3748,"2011-04-08",4.0,"50cl bottle. Pours a deep, cloudy, glowing orange gold with a very thick, though short-lived, white head that never dissipates completely and leaves a few strings and spots of lace on the glass (and also overflowed bottle upon removing cap). The aroma is sweet and fruity with touches of phenolic/clove character and some grassy and orange hops - sweeter and slightly less hop-forward than Brooklyn bottled version. The flavor is sweet and malty as well as fruity/estery and complex. The hop character is grassy and distinct and provides good balancing bitterness towards mid-palate. A delicious blend of Weizenbock and hops. The finish is somewhat dry with complex malt character (melanoidins, caramel, bread crust, wheat) also rounding it out nicely. The mouthfeel is very highly carbonated with a fairly full body. Overall, a very nice beer that is a bit different than the Brooklyn version (not *quite* as good, but still very good).

This one has a great scent, you can smell the dry hopping and it has a nice citrus spice character. Theres some traditional fruity wheaty hefe scent in here too which intrigues me to try it.

Its a taste experience, it has a nice balance though its as expected a far hoppier version of the darker hefes. It starts with a typical wheat flavor and then leads into a nice bit of hops, nice and bitter.

Its medium bodied and not quite the most drinkable brew. It paired nicely with some guacamole and chips.

The label on the bottle has the abv (8.2%) and a description of the beer on the back. There is no freshness date but there seems to be a batch number or bottle code on the back label.


Appearance: It has a thick cloudy, yeasty looking body with a tan/orange color and a tall white head. The head fades fairly fast and leaves just a small ring of foam on top. Lacing is minimal and spotty and slick.

Smell: The aroma has a good wheat bready and yeasty character with hints of ripe banana and citrusy herbal hops.

Taste/Palate: There is a good bit of bready/yeasty character and flavor. I get mild notes of banana, pineapple, clove and hints of orange. The hop profile is more noticeable than most Weizenbocks and adds a good balance of spicy, herbal, (almost minty) and citrus bitterness. The palate has a smooth and silky, almost oily texture with mellow carbonation.

3748,"2010-10-20",3.0,"500 ml. bottle. Pours a thin, off white head, with some lacing, over a cloudy dark god (SRM 6) body.....nose is bubblegum, banana, peach, apricot (they got loose with the esters).....taste is a multitude of fruits, including banana, peach, apricot, finishing with a bitter hop bite.....mouth feel is thick, carbonation low. This is a very different Weizen Bock. The esters are overwhelmingly in the light fruit end of the spectrum. This means the heavy malts flavors of a dark Weizen, such as plum and cherry, are completely missing. There are minimal phenolic tones.  It misses on the pale end of the Weizen spectrum also.

3748,"2010-10-16",3.3,"Bottle, German club, Brisbane
Hazy orange gold body, large dense white head hangs around, like youd expect from a good weizen.
Nose is a combination, perhaps a tad odd, of tangy citrus, herbal hops with the classic banana esters and clove spice of a wiessbier.
High carbonation, plenty of body and creaminess.
Pale wheat malt sweetness is quite rich on the front palate, provides base for vanilla and peppery phenolics with some over-ripe banana flavour. Grass, herbal hops are in the mix with some odd, slightly oxidised notes of dried apricot in there lingering on the finish, with a boozy warmth.
Certainly a unique, different taken on the weizen. Quite enjoyable, but a tad disconjointed overall.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

Appearance : Clear pale orange with medium thin and bubbly head.

Aroma : Quite malty with spicy and fruity hops. Some esters. Notes of bananas.

Taste : Fruity and spicy. Finish is quite spicy and mineral. Taste has nice notes of bananas.

Overall : Much less tasty than the Brooklyn version. Taste is very mineral even a bit metallic. Maybe something is wrong with this bottle. I have another one that I will crack open later. Still there are nice elements in this beer. A little bit too much spices but nice esters and malts. Rather drinkable even if a bit harsh on the finish cause of the spices and the alcohol bite.

Nice aggressive noble hop note, very unweizen, though there is still a but of wheat that is in the background to the nice hoppiness. Spicy and hoppy, very up front. Flavor has a bit more of the wheat character, at least to start. The wheat, bubble gum and clove really start nicely but are pushed out by the hop notes that come out for the latter half.  Finishes spicy and quite assertive. Medium body and a softer carbonation.

S- A floral/ noble hop profile is soft yet the most dominant part of the nose. Behind this is a mild citrus fruit tone.

T- Soft flavor upfront of oranges with a hint of floral hop overtones. A a big dose of sweet, bready yeast comes through for the finish as well as the floral hops kick in more for the finish also and leave a very mild bite to them as a hint of citrus juice sticks around.

P- heavenly. A medium amount of soft bubbly carbonation compliments a silky smooth light to medium weight yeasty body with just a touch of juicy hop oils.

O- This is a great brew. The European version of this collaboration has a much softer, less aggressive, more noble character- though I do enjoy the boldness of the American version as well. The 8.2% is undetectable and this is a very drinkable, good brew.

3748,"2010-04-18",4.2,"As a comic book geek Im a big fan of inter-company crossovers, and Ive always longed to see the beer equivalent of this. Well, its finally happened thanks to the German brewery G. Schneider & Sohn teaming up with New Yorks own Brooklyn Brewery to create the Schneider-Brooklyner Hopfen Weisse. Theres a long story behind this team up, but basically the brewmasters of each brewery were fans of each other and decided to swap jobs to create two takes on the same beer. This particular beer is brewed in Germany using local hops as overseen by Garret Oliver of Brooklyn. The result is a very tasty, easy-to-drink beer that anyone would likely enjoy.POUR, COLOR AND AROMAIf I didnt know better, Id think this was an India Pale Ale from the complexion alone. Its a shade of bright orange which is darker at the top than it is at the bottom. I swirled up the 500ml bottle to homogenize any sediment at the bottom, but I didnt notice any in my glass. Not that the liquid is clear by any means, since its extremely murky.The head was a bit smaller than I anticipated, resembling something closer to a barley-based beer which was white, foamy, and creamy. It dissolved rather quickly and left almost no lacing on the glass, surprisingly.The aroma was very citrusy with lemon being the predominant ingredient. I did detect some spicy components [i.e. clove, nutmeg], but they were rather mild. Regardless, the smell was very inviting like a glass of freshly-squeezed juice.TASTEJust to set the record straight, Hopfen Weisse is actually a weizenbock, which is a form of a hefeweizen. Its a wheat beer to be sure, but quite different due to its potency as well as its spicy kick. Upon my first swig of this beer I detected a very crisp, citrusy palate followed by a slightly dry, spicy backend. Lemon was very prominent, but it didnt overwhelm the rest of the palate. In fact, its difficult to describe the taste here since its quite different from most beers Ive drank. I would describe the initial mouthfeel as juicy, sweet, and overall delectable, followed by a distinct different finish which is spicy, slightly dry, but rather clean as there is next to not aftertaste at all. Overall, it adds up to a very original and appealing flavor. Its uniqueness is tasty enough to satisfy but without the intensity of an overwhelming beer.FINISHWhether youre a wheat beer fan or not, we can all agree that beers of this type are traditionally easier on the palate than most ales and lagers. Hopfen Weisse has a thick, soft, almost chewy mouthfeel. The flavor is indeed potent with spices, but they do not scare away the drinker. The end result is a very drinker-friendly, smooth beer thats so tasty and so easy to drink its difficult to savor it in sips rather than gulps.BODYIf youve been following my beer reviews with any consistency you know Im not a big fan of imperial or potent beers mostly due to the fact the alcohol tends to upstage the flavor. However, in the case of Hopfen Weisse, this is a beer so tasty and light in the mouth that the alcohol content seems virtually non-existent. For a beer with an 8.2% ABV, I did not taste or notice the potency until long after I had finished an entire 500ml liter bottle. This is certainly forgivable considering that this is a weizenbock after all, and this beer deserves accolades for masking its potency so well.FINAL THOUGHTSWhile I might not consider Schneider-Brooklyner Hopfen Weisse one of my personal favorite beers of all time, I still have to admit it one of the most novel brews Ive even encountered. The price is a bit steep at $5 per bottle (a penny per milliliter), but in the end its definitely worth it. One of the few beers I would consider a Must-drink!NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouN3SQCDDgw","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

3748,"2009-12-20",3.5,"A: Pours a very cloudy muddy yellow brown color. You could pass it off as apple cider with a huge head. As I mentioned the head is thunderous. You cant even come close to pouring the entire bottle into a hefe glass. The head is made of millions of tiny bubbles, that turns to an almost sea foam like character on top. The reason it got the 4 here is because of the lacing because lets be honest its kind of an ugly beer. Very few Hefes sport lacing and this baby has it from the top to the bottom of the glass. Sheets of lacing baby.

S: Bold smell. Tons of clove right up front and center. Buttered yeast rolls and mashed overripe banana round out the aroma of this bad boy.

T: Big tasting brew as well. The marriage is not quite there, but it is a nice tasting brew. If it could have somehow been pulled together a little better it would probably be a favorite of mine. As it stands its a beer with a lot of promise. As for the taste. Tons of cloves, and a hint of hops. There is a hop bite somewhere in the middle that takes you by surprise. Banana stands out as well. Its a more complex version of your typical Hefe.

M: Light and bubbly, but the ABV lets you know its there.","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"

A new classic.
A vertical tasting against a 2 year old proves interresting. Citric hop notes decrease, ligt oxidized notes appear, but it gains a fascinating dryness which I usually ascociate with Orval. Alcohol is more evident but blends well with the flowery perfumed notes. I am looking forward to see how it develops further.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","jonas"

3748,"2009-11-18",3.5,"Yellow with brown hues, plenty of yeast haze. 4 cm white airy head that dissipates after a while, while leaving nice lacings on the glass.

Nice hop character in the nose - grapefruit, grass an resins, some pine-needles. Banana. Some yeast. Quite a lot of white pepper. Decent malt character beneath - white bread, wheat. Quite nice overall, but there are some notes that are slightly too assertive, not really harmonious.

The taste is not as impressive as the smell. Again, there are plenty of hops, but they are not as well defined as in the smell (grape, grass, floral notes). A rather sweet and juicy malty backbone mixes with a prominent spicy character (mostly white pepper). Some flavors of bubblegum, and of course banana. The finish is mildly bitter and dominated by a very sweet and sticky taste of alcohol, making the beer slightly perfumy. Faint mineral-notes, bread and hints of lemon lingers in the mouth.

Moderate body, plenty of carbonation but the bubbles are rather calm. Slightly chewy due to the alcohol.

This is a rather good beer, but for some reason it didnt really do it for me. This one proves that more hops is not always better. It lacks balance, the flavors are not integrated with each other and the alcohol is too prominent.

3748,"2009-10-17",3.4,"Well, well, well... what on earth do we have here? I dont know if the rumours are true in terms of this beer having U.S. hops provided by Brooklyn, but it does certainly have a slightly U.S. hop conc. Instantly on opening the bottle Im greeted with big floral aromatics reminiscent of Simcoe, or Warrior type hops, big perfumed aroma, then behind it lie pineapple, loads of tropical fruit everywhere from classic citrus and quite sharp notes right down to mellow banana, melon, passion fruit... It actually looks the business - which is a big surprise to this less than enthusiastic Weiss beer drinker. Pours orange/blonde with a pinkish hue, nice creamy looking head, doesnt sit massively high, but it does sustain itself and keeps a creamy inviting look to it. Flavour is surprisingly big and rich with more than a fare-share of complexity. Straight up Im hit with a good hop smack, followed by soft and quite lush undertones of more tropical fruit, lemon, banana and melon make a reappearance then into some really quite obscure flavours from the hops consisting of what tastes like dental mouth wash, floral hops, some serious perfume, soap and then some more familiar flavours of grapefruit, orange peel and so on. Finish is commendably bitter for the style. My only true criticisms concern mouth feel, which could be a little bit more lush and less sharply carbonated, but all in all Im not even that bothered by the average palate feel, however, I do feel that the weird free form breakdown in the middle of quite strange - verging on clinical - flavours threaten to swamp the positive points, the balance needs some serious attention and tweeking to score higher in my opinion, but at the end of the day all I can say is: I tried this beer at a total whim not expecting  much considering Im not the biggest Weiss beer fan in the world (by a long shot!) but here I am actually whole heartedly enjoying this peculiar brew. Seems the answer to getting me into Weiss beer is pack the bugger full of hops. I may actually by a few more of these... As a last note, this beer reminds me of free form Jazz - an aquired taste and at times can sound like a racket, but there something most definitely accomplished in the playing that makes it something definitely worth paying attention to, and not ignoring. P.S. even the alcohol is relatively well hidden, what the f***k is going on here?!","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"

3748,"2009-08-19",4.0,"Bottle. Hazy radiant gold with a medium white head. Aroma is a rich and fruity blend of citrusy hop, banana ester, a little clove, yeast, and a little spice - like a fruit salad beer. Flavor has a lot of banana ester and orange-like hops, leading into a clove and lemon finish. Starts fairly sweet but finishes a bit dry and very clean. Throughout the profile, the hops are very well mated to the malt - Hallertauer is a great hop for this brew. Palate is pleasantly smooth and lively. A very impressive brew, and a style I look forward to exploring more. This one is particularly well balanced and definitely showcases the skill of both breweries.","Houston, Texas, USA","jumpjet2k"

Flavor starts with an assertive hop bite suggesting tangerine, balanced in the middle by textured wheat and other grain.  Finish puts a crisp and refreshing bitter touch on the traditional mildness of a hefeweizen.

Pleasant aroma of wheat malt and spicy, herbal noble hops.  Looks like they dry-hopped with Hallertauer.  A little bit of Bavarian countryside grass.  My only knock on the aroma is the presence of alcohol.  Smells a tad boozy.  Taste is first and foremost dominated by the yeast - dough, banana, a touch of bubble gum, clove, and vanilla.  Some citrus is also present in the flavor profile.  Like the aroma, my one gripe with the flavor is the boozy alcohol.  Not as bad as some 8%+ beers fall victim to, but still more than necessary.  Medium-light, creamy body with lively carbonation and a somewhat bitter finish.  Balanced though.  Overall a really good pale Weizenbock that could be stellar if the booziness were diminished.

Reminiscent of Unibroue Trois Pistoles in a strange way- very fruity with a similar yeasty touch, though different in style and hop profile. Some marmite sneaking accompanied by wild strawberries, yasmin and mango. Sweet. The hops add a lot to this beer (dry hopping) which results in a relatively low bitterness.

Stalwart weizenbock from my favourite wheat beer brewery in the world, spiced with rich amounts of hops the American way. The phenols and the hops seem to create a wonderful, yet bizzare-ish rubber/plastic flavour backbone thats yummy for some and yuky for others. Bitterness is low, as recommended.

I can imagine this beer blowing minds over in Germany; they probably either hate it or think its the best innovation in brewing since the pilsner.   Anyway, lots of yeast sludge going on, almost chunky, but it works here.   Huge tropical smoothie and spicy herbal hop aroma.   Amazing how the tropical notes mix with the more spicy notes that I usually associate with german hops.   There is a hint of banana, but the dry-hopping dominates any yeast aromas.   The flavor is also very hop-dominated, with a firm hef malt backbone.   The traditional bavarian hefewiesse yeast flavors get lost in the cascade of spicy and tropical hops.   This really tastes like a hef-IPA.   Nothing like any weizenbock that I;ve had before.   I feel bad for liking this so much, because it seems like such a bastardization of tradition, but if you like hefs and IPAs, this is an awesome combination.   Where the rich flavors of a more typical weizenbock might tire after a glass, the hops in this beer just draw you back for more.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

In the mouth, a chewy body, unusual for a Weisse, with virtually no alcoholic heat. (It’s really 8.2 percent?) Complex layers of flavor run from vinous depths to a slightly bitter, lemon-pith finish.

The lacing is delicate and minimal.  The smell is big and spicy with huge German hops with a sweetness of bananas and cloves.  This is all on top of the sweet wheat and yeast base that pervades the aroma.  The taste follows the aroma and has the big wheat base that has abundant spices and lemon zest thrown in.  The mouthfeel is medium and creamy with huge carbonation.  Drinkability is extremely high on this one and it makes for an excellent summer brew.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
3748,"2008-06-28",4.6,"Appearance: Super cloudy and light yellow. Nice fluffy head that sticks around. Yep, its a german wheat.

Aroma: The usual banana clove but an exceptional floral aroma shines through. The dry-hop is clear and present.

Flavor: Very prominent bitterness, strong yeast esthers that provide the normal banana and a very soft breadiness. The hop flavor might be there. Definitely a floral flavor, but the yeast and bitterness cover most of it up.

Mouthfeel: A little slick, dry, strong carbonation.

Overall: Excellent beer. Really takes the weizenbock to the next level. The dryhopping sets this one apart. The aroma really and touch of hop flavor shine and make this beer something unique. I got the german one that is dry hopped with hallertauer saphir. Id really like to get my hands on the one dry hopped with amarillo. I would drink these all night.","USA","OFlan"

Pours deep, cloudy gold (more tan-brown once you get all the sediment from the bottom), with classic wheat-beer carbonation bubbles, but lots of floating particles, too. White bubbly head.

Aroma is clean and subtle.
Mouth feel is effervescent & full.  The lacing is made up of very clear luminescent bubbles.
The banana sweet wheat flavor is not so much balanced as it is beaten down but the dry champagne flavor and hard hop edge.  There is an almost chalky lemony flavor followed by a very brief sharp hop bite.  
Interesting combination of flavors.  I have never had a wheat that works with so much IBU.   Its refreshing and you can feel it in your belly.
Its good.","Westfield, New Jersey, USA","hoooraybeer"
3748,"2008-06-18",3.7,"Batch 2.  A careful pour yields a very lightly hazy golden-orange color.  A foamy, snow white head shows fairly good retention, settling slowly to a thin layer with a solid edge.  Lacing is sudsy, with a few spots and patches remaining on the glass.  Aromas include fresh banana esters, orange peel, sweet, bready yeast, wheat, and lemony hops.  Some spicing is present as well, notably clove and a touch of coriander.  Flavors basically follow suit, though the citrus hop content is surprisingly potent.  The fruity, sweet elements are well balanced by the bitter hops, as well as a spicy, peppery finish.  Tastes really fresh.  Quite drinkable, even at 8.2%.  Medium-plus bodied, the lively, fizzy carbonation intensifies the spiciness a good deal.  Overall, this is a very enjoyable brew.  The primary differentiation from the Brooklyn-brewed version is a heftier citrus hop billing.  Because of this, Id give the slight edge to the Schneider-brewed version.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Some yeast had settled at the bottom that was enticed into the pour.  Flavor offers more hop than the aroma would indicate.  Other flavors include bubble gum, spice, wheat, clove,and  banana.  The sip begins smooth but finishes with dry zesty carbonated hop.  What a super beer.  It offers so much.  So many flavors, so many aromas, so many different feels in each sip.

3748,"2008-06-12",3.0,"Bottle, at same time as the Brooklyn version.  Pours a slightly darker and slightly hazier than the dark straw of the Brooklyn version.  Massive white head is less sustainable and has slightly less lacing than Brooklyn.  Aroma of citric, mango, and wheat, and a hint of burnt marshmallow, more complex, but less appealing than the Brooklyn.  Flavor is astringent and medicinal, but this fades to a bitter fruit.  Medium mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.  Not all that great to be honest.  And even though the Brooklyn version is better, it still isnt amazing.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Butters"

There is a toffee that makes me think of a Belgian golden ale.  Flavor is wheat, yeast, tingly hops, alcohol.  The alcohol is a bit much - thinning & drying more than I would like.  Again, that Belgian maltiness is there in the finish.  At the tail end some minerals come out.","Buffalo, New York, USA","rudolf"

3748,"2008-05-22",4.4,"Bottle. Pours hazy orangey gold with a lasting tall off-white head. Aroma is an intriguing blend of citrus hops and perhaps the nicest banana/clove/spice combination I have yet to encounter. The flavor is everything that I love about Weizen Bocks; banana, clove, lemon, and lots of spices with a great citrus/herbal hop profile. The mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated and a very dry finish hides every bit of the 8.2%. A wonderful collaboration.","Sevierville, Tennessee, USA","muenster"
3748,"2008-05-22",4.7,"500ml brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester.  Pours a murky golden yellow body with a good inch of off-white head.  Smells sweet and phenolic - with banana, nut, spice, citrus, and malt all playing big roles.  Tastes very complex, sweet, spicy, grassy, malty...  Nut, banana, lemon, spices, orange, hints of caramel malt...  More hoppy than a lot of examples of the style Ive tried, but only to balance the flavor out.  Other than a slight hop flavor that lingers, the finish is otherwise fairly clean and rather dry.  Rich full mouthfeel, yet ample carbonation and no alcohol flavor or warming makes this beer an easier drinker than expected.  Wow, this beer is good.  Extremely flavorful, complex, balanced and very drinkable.  Ill definitely be snagging a few bottles of this again, not only to compare to the Brooklyner-Schneider version, but also to see how it ages over the next few months (if I can wait that long!)","Derry, New Hampshire, USA","BigBen2120"
3748,"2008-05-22",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
An impressive equilibrum of herbal, spicy hoppiness, citrusy wheat, and banana/peach esters thrives throughout this marvelous hybrid of a Weizenbock.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A frothy cumulus of a head lingers atop the amber-infused golden (before the complete yeast pour, of course).
-Although the body is nourishing, it remains airy and amazingly drinkable for its size.
-There is no sign of the abv in the flavor profile.
-The ending is rather soft, offering mild leafy hop bitterness and milky, earthy yeastiness.
-The harmless yet furious tingling of a carbonation sure is peculiar, but it works perfectly.
-I dont understand how this German-brewed version can be so much cheaper than its Brooklyn-brewed compatriot.

The aroma profile of a wheat beer is an easy one for the hops to dominate as they do in this. The flavor is citrusy and waxy, light bitterness, mild alcohol. Mouthfeel is full and smooth from the wheat, a decent amount of carbonation, and a waxy feel. Finishes citrusy and bitter and then fades to wheat and banana, a little warmth comes out as well.

3748,"2008-05-14",4.1,"Foaming rocky haze in requisite trumpet. Aroma immediately evocative of Belgium for me- that of a juicily hopped, unspicy, citrussy Tripel (Rulles?). Lemon and lime jelly, marmalade, spruce, rind, fibrous grapefruity hop. Wow. Nothing Germanic going on here whatsoever. The hops have just completely smashed the wheat to the canvas in the first round, which is great but I wanted the two to scrap it out. Flavour an accidental and unexpectedly pleasurable mouthful of soap, swallowed bathfoam/bubble mix, densely citrussy hop bittersweetness, without even the faintest trace of alcohol. Absolutely not a Weizen Bock, but an American Pale Tripelweizen, and I love it, but what happened to the weizen? Its just a bit too interchangeable with a marmaladey Belgian Tripel for me. Now, a genuinely balanced fusion of silky estery banana, bubblegum, pepper, wheaty sharpness AND punchy American hops at 8.2%, now THAT really would be interesting....","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"

The flavor included bananas, oranges, wheat, and also some spicy, herbal hop notes.  The 8.2% ABV was very well hidden.  The mouthfeel was medium to full-bodied with moderate carbonation.

Like a really nice wheat mixed in with lawn clippings, again from the hops.

Body is full with limited filtration and loads of lees at the bottom with some great carbonation with no apparent alcohol.

Smell: Juicy fruit aroma of apricots, citrusy grapefruit, even some pineapple. Notes of clove, banana, and wheat dough all take a backseat to the hop aromas.

Taste: Jumps right in the citric, sweet fruit juices from the aroma. Big bite of orange pith. Drop of banana smoothie with some white pepper tossed in. Quick hint of vanilla in the middle. Sure, theres some tangy wheatiness, but all of the wheat characteristics are obscured by all the hops. A touch of acidity along the way. Substantial hop spices with a medium, though lasting bitterness. Juicy, bittersweet finish.

The hefeweizen side of the card was pretty good, but the sweet malts mixed with the hops ended up producing a sweet hoppy taste that was a little bit too much.

3748,"2007-12-29",3.6,"Pretty well carbonated as I end up with an easily four-finger thick head after I pour it into my tulip glass.  The head is a fluffy crown of froth, a light tan color and actually crests the top of my glass almost two fingers without overflowing.  Interesting herbal aromatics mix with some of the more typical phenolic clove and banana esters.  Also noticed is a green apple fruit aroma, perhaps a touch of plum and some substantial grain aromas reminiscent of grass, tart wheat and sweet malt.  I like how hoppy the nose is, the hops are on par with the typical Hefe Weizen notes.  The hops are definitely herbal, add a touch of grassiness, but perhaps a bit more like green hay.

Light feeling up front, but then the beer picks up a chewy heft to it that lets you know this is a bit bigger than your typical Hefe Weizen.  The extra malt contributes a nice, grain-like sweetness which accentuates a banana flavor.  The beer is quite hoppy throughout, with a solid bitterness that starts up front, continues and really adds a bite to the finish.  The hop note is quite herbal in character, a bit green and at times it is even a bit astringent.  This definitely has far more hop character that a typical Hefe Weizen, which is as promised, with a much higher bitterness and a substantial dry hopped character.  The beer hides its alcohol pretty well, but there is a touch of alcoholic spiciness noticeable in the finish.  The hop character and wheat notes combine to give this beer a slight lemon flavor towards the end of a sip.

An interesting beer, at times the hop character can get in the way of the traditional Hefe Weizen elements, but I like the attempt.  It is always interesting to try a new hop (Saphir in this case); it has this really green, herbal note to it that is quite distinct and almost like under-ripe pepper.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Big wheaty aroma with fine hints to banana, orange, pineapple, and other citrusy peels that are perhaps a bit over ripened and soggy. Quite a big and complexingly delight of fun fruityness on the nose.

Flavors are bold and ripe with fruity tropical punch and wheaty tang that start out well but pale out after a while and become a heavy faction of wheat toned tang and orangey/banana mush. Which isnt bad mind you, but it seemed to lose its complexity a bit as it went along. But damn if it isnt good. The extra pithy character of yeast and hops is quite unique and bright. Making for a nice tropical bite in the finish. 

Feel is just over medium with a huge wheaty base and tang of tropical fruit goodness and partailly parching bite and bitteness of pith and peels. Big on the orange character with a twist of pine, grapefruit. lime, and lemon.

If there are any of characteristic flavors of a hefeweizen (banana, cloves, bubble gum), they are comletely overwhelemed by piney, resinous hops. The variety too, probably chinook or centennial (no way is that Hallertau), is completely inappropriate for a wheat. Not good","somerville, Massachusetts, USA","Hugerat"

Nice aroma off the bat, with all of the usual wheat beer characteristics, banana bread, clove, with a nice hop undertone, that faded as the beer warmed.

The foggy, strawberry blonde liquid rolls forth with a fanfare of billowing, airy fluff that boasts Herculean stamina. Fantastic fruity/spicy aromas leap from my glass- apricot, honey, raspberry syrup, tangelo, musk, currants, key lime, and lapsang souchoung. The round, malty flavor also features jammy fruit, spiced red grape jelly, cherry, and spruce. Bubblegum and five-spice enhances the warmly ethanolic finish. A refreshing, juicy mouthfeel is light and lively with carbonation, but not overcrisp. Heady afterflavors of expensive gin, incense, Hawaiian Punch, rosehips, and ruby grapefruit are hammered home by a retronasal clove/cinnamon karate kick.

3748,"2007-12-02",4.1,"Bottle. [thank you, sk8viking]Poured in my Erdinger Weizen-glass. Poured with a big, beautiful slightly dirty white head - even poured correctly. Very frothy, creamy at the centre and bubbly nearer the glass. The liquid in a deep, deep, golden copper with a slight haze to it, but otherwise clear. A stunning array of bubbles surges towards the head that have only lowered about 1cm while Ive written all the above :o).
Aroma is quite deep with lots of wheat, ripe banana, apples, a touch of viniousness and a citric tartness as well. Very creamy mouthfeel, lots of small bubbles, but t still feels rather low in carbonation. But it sticks nicely to my teeth and the inside of my cheeks. Feels wonderful. 
At first the taste underwhelms me, feels as if the aroma is better and more complex. It begins like a powerful regular hefe, where wheat, yeast and slight German hops appear. But as it warms up, and I balance it around in my mouth, lots of other things happen. The ripe fruit, sweet with banana at the forefront, are more pronounced. The hops are more apparent, flowery, peppery and rather bitter, actually. The fruit add a little tartness as well, slightly citric. And there are ginger, vanilla and pepper tones throughout. Wonderful balance, wonderful beer.","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"

Dingy golden color with a huge, cream colored and textured head. The initial taste is toffee of good strength. It quickly transitions to one of bananas, apples, pears, and perhaps pineapple. The finishing hops taste of thistle and are perfectly well chosen for this unique beer. It seems to be better warm. I had heard and read about this beer all summer, but could not find it anywhere in my area. As luck would have it, I found a bottle in a shop near my parents house over the holiday, which is 300 miles from my home. It is more bitter than I expected, but has an enormous amount of potential.. The hefe-hop interplay is fabulous. With a tweak to either the recipe or process, this could be a perfect beer.

3748,"2007-11-09",3.6,"THOUGHTS: It didnt seem like a weizen bock at all. Not in look, aroma, flavor or palate. It was almost like two different beers from the glass I had without the yeast to when I added. At least in feel and look, that is. A nice beer but an awful weizen bock. Its more like a cross between a dunkle weise and a wit.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a hazy, dark yellow that gets way darker after the yeast is added, turning more of a light brown. It had great carbonation and a large to huge foamy, white head. The aroma was very light hops, light to moderate doughy yeast, slight banana and lemon and wheat. The initial flavor was lightly sweet and acidic, while the finish was heavy sweetness, moderate acidity and bitterness and sour with a short duration. The flavor started with a slight  milk chocolate malt flavor turning toward wheat and lemon along with som lemony hops in the finish, but they seemed like they didnt belong there. Not a good combination, but luckily that lemon hop flavor is not that strong so it isnt too off putting. The medium to full body was creamy with soft carbonation and a slightly chalky and light to moderate astringent finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

The flavor was earthy to te point of nearly seeming dirty.  The citrusy hops cut through everything, complimenting the yeast and lemony wheat.  The piney undertone was almost forgotten with the powerful citrus and even more powerful bitterness taking full control.

3748,"2007-10-11",2.4,"Deep, hazy gold. Sticky, off-white head settles pretty quickly to a solid half inch, and stays through the pint, leaving nice lacing.

Banana ester is quite strong in this bottle, with a hearty kick of clove. It does not make a pleasant combination with the abundant, somewhat aggressive hops. Sweet malt enters the mix, and does not help the situation.

On the thin side of medium in the mouth. The hops and spicy wheat are in control here, though the clove makes itself known in the long finish. Good slightly sweet malt in there as well. A bit hot to boot. Definitely tastes better than it smells.

Carbonation is appropriate for a weizen, with the abundant bubbles doing a fine palate-scrubbing job here.

It poured a thick, muddy, grayish-brown, with massive amounts of yeast swirling around like smoke. Smells like hops, evergreen, and lemon zest. Covering the booze is no problem with those tangy yet grassy hops. The bitterness is in the drivers seat, and youre in the back with the lemon and pine.

Lars described that small peaces of hops could be found in the foam when they had the draught version. The sniff gave the impression of heavy sweet hoppy aroma, citrus, floral, hint of elderflower. Notes of coriander, banana and wheat could also be felt. Over the palate came underlying fruity notes and what appeared as pineapple. Full bodied with a thick texture and an average carbonation. Moderated sweet flavor with light bitterness and a hint of acidic. Extremely smooth and nice. Sweet and dry finish that ends light bitter.

3748,"2007-09-16",3.3,"Bottle shared by Duff on 9/1/07Very, very heavily sedimented with hops.  It seems very gritty on the palate, which would seem to indicate hop pellets, but who knows.  The bitterness is certainly up there.  Almost like a Noble Hop dark wheat IPA.  There, I just categorized this one.  Not much head, possibly due to the hop oils, but the carbonation is fairly light too.  Deep, muddy, nearly opaque chocolate brown.I like the hops and I think they are well-done and fresh tasting/smelling, without any of the obnoxious C-hop bitterness (obviously), but the malt structure is a bit odd.  Chocolate and creamy base malt sugars dont seem too assertive, nor is there any real cohesion between the malt and hops.  Yeast adds light banana and a hint of bubble gum on the finish, but is drowned out by hop bitterness.  Not sure what to make of this one, and while theres nothing wrong with it (other than the fact that I think they could condition some more of the hop sediment out before bottling), I dont think theres anything terribly unique here.  Just a boatload of fresh hop flavor and aroma.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Has a bright lemon character, musty yeastiness, and a hint of coriander spiciness. Dense, lively carbonation which feels velvety. Has a great underlying tartness from the wheat malt, which makes it nice and sharp. Tons of citruses which lean toward orange/tangerine.

3748,"2007-09-10",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 12, 2010 In short: A fruity, sweet and hoppy wheat beer.  Hugely drinkable.
How: Bottle 500ml, consumed fresh a few days after purchase (side by side with sister Brooklyner-Schneider Hopfen-Weisse )
The look: Cloudy dark yellow body topped by a medium off-white head
In long: Nose of lemon pie and toasted wheat.  Taste has a lot of hay, flavours of crusty pie, banana cake and lemon.  A little sugary.  Strong spicy hops presence, with dry bitterness and white pepper sensation.  Some dry herbs. Nice acidic touch in the finish.  Little to no alcohol presence.  Body is a little fluffy.  Carbonation is very aggressive/tickling and it suits the beer just fine.  Feeling of a sweetened Berliner Weisse on steroids.  Side-by-side comparison I slightly preferred its american sister Brooklyner-Schneider Hopfen-Weisse.  A very good beer by itself but with its sister Brooklyner available this one becomes as essential as a screwdriver in an emergency operating room.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
3748,"2007-09-08",4.2,"Pours a cloudy amber-orange with a large, frothy, off-white head. Wow. Sugary sweet and fruity hops on the nose, almost like candied hops. Im just jazzed to sample a wheat with a solid hop presence. The floral hop character in this one reminds me of Two Hearted, only just a bit sweeter and with a faint wheat backing. Light to medium-bodied and slick with a nice, lightly bitter finish. The flavor is sweet candied hops, light mildly dry wheat with a bit of hop resin coming forward at the end. If there are any bubblegum, banana or clove characteristics in here, theyre well hidden behind the hops. As a fan of wheats and IPAs, this is an amazingly tasty and drinkable beer, especially given the ABV. If youre a die-hard IPA drinker and dont care for wheats, you might find it a bit thin for your tastes, but if you like wheats, and youre a hop head, this may just be the beer for you. After sampling Gumballhead a while back, Ive been jonesing for another hoppy wheat, and now we actually have one thats available locally.

Aroma is very familiar but Im having a hard time putting my finger on it.   There is some banana and cloves but also a big sweetness. Enticing.  The flavor is even more interesting.  For a weizen bock this is incredibly complex.  The first thing I taste is some hops and the cloves, flowery.  Then the sweet candy bock rolls over my tongue and really bursts.  The finish is just enough clean enough not to be cloying.  Where are they hiding the alcohol?  The body isnt overly weighty but it does have substantial mouth feel.

3748,"2007-09-05",3.4,"Booming head, peculiar aroma. As the head fizzles upward, were looking at a dusty, polished gold beam and a tight, pillowy tan head. The aroma signals cherry blossoms, clover, anise, buttered lilacs and licorice root. A mild cedar gloss comes in with corn syrup on the backend. Flavor achieves a mildly chewy body, allocating buttered vanilla rum toffees all around. Soft white floral petals, cackled white pepper and clover concur the herbal spiced signature. Warming mouthfeel with didactic, dialed down carbonation, leaving an almond clover alcohol sting and flavor through the mouth post sip. Too many raw green hops emitting a palatary greenhouse effect. Green lemon grass stems twine with bleached honey and jojoba almond butter for a franticly white spiced ending chock full of anise and cackled clover.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

With a smooth base of malt, hops roar like lions with bitterness and a slight maple syrup nuance that kept me interested. The rolling variety of tastes kept me from noticing the alcohol as I served the ale with broiled chicken and string beans steamed with garlic slices.

Mouthfeel was pleasant enough with a medium mouthfeel that had lively carbonation and a slightly dry alcoholic finish.

3748,"2007-09-02",4.6,"I love everything about this beer: Im extremely partial to Wheat Beers, and theres nobody who does them better than Schneider.  I love the cloudy, orange/gold color that reveals whisps of yeast that are gone as soon as they appear; the terrific head that could stand for hours; the citrusy aroma, and the sweet hop flavor that requires no lemon or orange to compliment this beer.

3748,"2007-09-02",4.2,"Riddled, then pours a deep amber(chocolate and banana milkshake), multi-hued and extremely clouded, totally opaque. A white head, very tall and foamy/frothy, recedes slowly. The aroma is loaded with sweet esters, banana peel, boisterous pineapple juice and hefty clove. Grassy and green from start to finish, each inhalation cementing the new knowledge that this can indeed work. Cinnamon and nutmeg notes float into the prose that is this libation. There is a distinct appleskin note that pops out with each full draw. Light floral hops and earth round out this most interesting and unorthodox aroma. The flavor is moderately hoppy; I cant imagine this being drinkable in many incarnations, but here it is blended well and yeast, wheat, hop and tropical fruit note interplay is well-executed and fun to unravel. bitterness is mild to moderate and extremely conducive to flavor and complexity expantion without drowning out low-profile wheat notes. Sweetness is medium and nowhere near cloying. Light, waxy white chocolate-wrapped caramels garner focus as the beer warms to room temperature. The finish is sweet and lightly peppered, yeast lingering, hop bitterness, grassy notes and clove beyond that; a finale is as complex as any other part of the experience. The mouthfeel is thick, smooth, lightly grainy with wheat malt, highly carbonated and well-dispersed across the palate. Knowing that this first batch is the only one that will ever be brewed at the German brewery that is partnered in this exploration is in itself rewarding enough. A chance to try a different interpretation, likely with some minor ingredient changes, will be reason enough to enjoy this again. Phenomenal.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

3748,"2007-08-31",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 11, 2008 Pours a straw yellow/gold with a huge white head.  Smells of lots of fresh sage like hops, cloves, coriander, bubble gum, lemon, bananas, some hints of orange.  Tastes mildly bitter in a complimentary way with nice sugary undertones, and rich flavorful mint.  The best way to describe the taste is that it resembles a good hefeweizen someone decided to dry hop with some noble hops.  Mouthfeel is full and malty.  Finish is sweet and peppery with lots of spicey undertones.  The 8.2% alcohol is very well masked on this one.

The aroma carried a hefty floral and perfumey hop presence, dusty, musty yeast, singed, rum-infused caramels, and a pinch of lemon.. full and intriguing.  Flavor had toasted caramel and wheat at the core with some sharper wheaty esters.. lemon zest accented the sides of the tongue leaving a dusty trail.. bit of overt alcohol showed up on the sweet finish.  Medium-bodied with a creamy middle paired with prickly wheat and hop bitterness.. left a sweet, but somewhat sharp finish.  This was good beer and an excellent idea.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
3748,"2007-08-23",3.7,"A creamy, sticky white head settles over the beer, which pours a hazy, thick pureed old banana color.  The aroma is very banana and sweet hops. The taste is sucrose and banana with a slightly old, pungent hoppy finish.  Finishes with a cloying hoppy sweetness.  The beer seems very simple in the flavors it presents, but surprisingly the banana is not overwhelming nor is it as typically offensive as I find bananas in my beers.  This is good stuff, if a little too carbonated for me.
Edit:
As the beer warms, I get a resiny, piny hop bitterness that tastes like hop pellets in the finish.  Also, perhaps a little of an alcoholic taste too, if only because of the sharpness of hops.  There is a creamy banana/citrus (think dreamsicle) taste to the beer as it warms that is cut by those flavors.  I stick by my rating.  Very good, but not excellent.","Kirkwood, Missouri, USA","xmarcnolanx"

Full and a little crisp, rose petals with light citrus.  Touch of blood oranges and grapefruit, probably from the dry hopping.  Dry, dark, and a little murky on exit - I think the alcohol should be dialed down a bit, if possible.  A good Hefeweizen mixed with the high-alcohol catch-all that we call an American Strong Ale.

I chose a ½ liter Wezen glass to sample this beer, and the magnificent head on the pour that was contained in the glass made me glad that I did.  The body was standard pale, hazy, and bubbly Weiss beer affair, on second looks, may be a little thicker than normal. The aroma was so much more than the typical wheat beer smells of lemon, banana, bubblegum, and clove, due to the generous addition of noble hops.  The phenolic spiciness typically present in wheat beer taste was similarly enhanced here with the herbal hop addition.  In addition to the spices, I got a mouthful of tropical fruits like melon, pineapple, and banana,  The aftertaste was tart like lemon peel and granny smith apples.  Quite an authentic summer quencher, but watch out for that 8.2% ABV.  A bit fuller in the mouth than the norm, making it feel slightly green.

Streams of CO2 quickly rise to the top upon first pouring this nectar before being phased out by the heavy amount of yeast that soon follows. Rich, spotty lacing is left all around the weizen glass. A real beauty to look at IMOif you can appreciate Bavarian wheats.
Smell is truly original in this one. Bananas, vanilla wafers, and clove greet you as always but waitits followed up with BIG, bold, ballsy amounts of citrus(lemon, grapefruit, orange), pineapple, and herbs. If anyone has wondered what a tour-de-force of estery yeast and juicy hops would turn out likelook no further. Its here.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas with an ultra high amount of zesty, herbal hops unlocking the door to the palates sensory threshold. 
Mouthfeel is smooth and velvety up front with a touch of sugary grapefruit easing down the back of the tongue for a nice, enjoyable, relaxing finish.
Ask yourself three vital questions before indulging in this beer. Are you a fan of Schneider Weisse beers? Are you a fan of hops being profiled in any beer style? Have you enjoyed any of the other Garrett Oliver projects, such as Blast? If so, this will be a pleasant surprise on all levels.

Murky bronze color with a tall heavy cream colored head. Hugh hoppy aroma, with herbal notes of rosemary and wintergreen; spices of mace and cloves and tropical fruits. Somewhat exotic scents, but not really my thing. Full, yet spritzy in feel. Light malt is quickly swept away by spices, and lot of them. Cloves, cinnamon, white pepper, allspice all make a rather abrupt appearance and continue though to the bitter end. Some grapefruit covered with vanilla noted in the finish along with a light return of pale malt. Finish is sharp and biting as the tongue is hop with a red pepper tingle.

This is an interesting concept. A dry hopped weisse and its a Brooklyn collaboration I had to give this a try when I noticed it. Pours a beautiful glowing yeast induced hazy orange. Unfortuanately not much of a head formed which surprises me. Half finger at its largest and quickly fading to a thin skim. The body does look damn good though.

Strong orange aromas rise from the glass with a very noticeable wheat twang. A squeeze or two of grapefruit pulp, which Im guessing comes from the ""robust"" dry-hopping. Mild clove in the background and a slight medicinal sweetness. The aroma is very unique and very mouthwatering.

Wow. The flavor just doesnt stand up to the wonderful aroma. Very subdued flavors that mesh well together but just dont really stand out like I hoped. Grapefruit and orange are the dominant flavors but its hard to tell where one begins and the other ends. Does have a nice fresh floral/grassy hoppiness to it. Again, hard to pick the difference. Flavor is good but a little too muddled and hard to define.

Thin mouthfeel with sluggish carbonation. Its odd but with the thin mouthfeel it still leaves some residue after the swallow. In my opinion this beer needs a little more creaminess. It seems a little too watery. Higher carbonation wouldnt hurt either.

Easy drinker for the high abv but with the muddled flavors and thin mouthfeel one pint is enough.

This is no doubt a good beer with an excellent aroma but (and Im not a brewmaster such as the two who got together to brew this so take this with a grain of salt) to me this beer could use a little tweaking and it could be a great treat. I probably would buy again cause it is enjoyable and unique but like I said, one at a time is enough for me.

Well carbonated but medium bodied, it has the expected flavors of old bananas, bubblegum, clove, a twist of lemon, but also carries a light floral/grassy bitterness.

The head is your typical abundant fluffy, velvety head that you get from just about every Hefe-Weisse. The aroma is very bread-y with strong floral hints. The taste is quite interesting. Its definitely not your normal wheat beer. The hops is a more dominant in this beer. Its like a spiced bread. The spices would obviously be the more dominant flavours since bread is pretty subtle. I do taste some very, very subtle notes of citrusy fruits. But the subtle flavours are difficult to define through the intensity of the hops. As the beer warms, the sweeter flavours tend to burst a little more. It seems to become a little more caramel-y. I can taste some banana as well.

That is, the hops interfered with the clove or banana yeastiness, and kept the beer from acheiving the full measure of its promise.  I see, however, that few share this view.

I enjoyed it but am not sure where this falls on the drinkability scale because it seems a bit too sweet and fruity.

Aroma of floral, earthy, spicy noble hops and some sweet wheat with a touch of bready German yeast.  Starts with a fairly full body, good carbonation and sweet malted wheat giving way to a big, fresh, perfumy hop bitterness with some notes of pine resin and warmth toward a bittersweet finish.

3748,"2007-08-05",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2008 Bottle into a weizen. Pours a very, very cloudy golden hue with a tall, well developed white head. This stuff smells awesome. My good friend is a homebrewer and for his latest batch he decided to brew a German styled hefeweizen with American styled hopping. Well, looks like someone stole his idea (okay, maybe its been done before, but Ive never had one.). The good news is that it is evidently awesome. The aroma has generous, defined citrus notes and bright, herbal spiciness. I get a little bit of the banana and wheat too. The flavor doesnt quite live up, but it is very drinkable. Less defined, potent hops are present on the palate but it still packs quite a punch for this style. Moderate banana sweetness and cloves intertwine with hints of grass, pepper, pine, lemon.  Actually, as weird as this is, its pretty tasteful. I see that these are Bavarian hops, but they a rather PNW attitude in this particular brew. The finish hints a little at bubblegum and is semi-sweet, drying out the palate only slightly from the heavy use of Hallertauer.  I personally am a fan of American styled experimentation in beer, it worked very well in this case. I was wooed by the individuality of this one.

Picked up another bottle of this stuff since I loved it so much the first time around. It has held up well for the last few months, but is nothing like a fresh bottle. The aroma is mildly spicy but is lacking the fresh citrus/pine thing. Still hints of juicy pineapple, banana, and cloves shine through with clarity. The flavor is less aggressive as well, but still packs a decent citrus presence and is moderately dry. Side note: when I poured the last bit out with all the yeast, the liquid was olive green. Pretty neat.

Bottle best before January 7, 2009. Pours very cloudy drark gold with a huge white head and rather large floating particles. The aroma is delightfully spicy with citrus, rough wheat, lemon, banana, clove, it seems very juicy. mm. The mouthfeel is just spritzy enough. I really like this beer. The hop quality is not obnoxious by west coast U.S. standards, but it is hugely assertive for the style. Lots of biting, spicy citrus and wood, slightly wild esters, perfectly balanced bread/wheat/fruit sweetness, and rich lemon are all noted. This stuff is fantastic. I seem to remember my first encounter being hoppier, but I’m thoroughly enjoying this bottle. I’d feel guilty for lowering the score. Delightful for the summer.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
3748,"2007-08-05",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2008 Pours lightly hazy and golden with a fluffy tan head. My first bottles of this were very turbid, recent bottles have cleared up. Aroma is thick and sticky with fresh hops. Notes of Hallertau orange juice, and spicy notes of lemon, herbs and pepper. Taste is lightly sweet, with more hop juice, this time with a little balance from the yeasty esters. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, and slightly sticky with lush carbonation. I really like Schneider, but Im not a fan of using noble hops like this.

3748,"2007-08-05",3.6,"Bottle. This comes with a LOT of hype. I was very eager to try this. The pour erupted with lots of foam, which is typical for a hefeweizen. Tall sturdy light tan head. Murky gold-to-amber colored body. Aroma is spicy with floral hops, lots of fruit (grapefruit, lemon peel, soft banana and pear juice), soft wheat and yeast. Taste is hoppy and different. Lots of citrus fruit, subtle yeast notes, banana, grass, flowers, spices, light bready notes and bitter hops. Body is light and crisp. Very bubbly. The burping begins after only a few sips. More lively carbonation expands the hops, fruit flavors, and yeast into a mildly satisfying finish. Citrusy hops and fruits intermingling with fading hefeweizen flavors. Like an IPA cut with hefeweizen to reduce the hop bitterness for someone not liking IPAs. Dont get wrong I like this and appreciate the experiment, but I would have liked more of the hefeweizen to come through.  ***Notching the appearance up due to all of the sediment coming out at the end.

Smells like a melding of brewers from Germany and the U.S. Theres the wheat aspect as well as a discernable sweet aleish hop aspect. Hops and wheat. What a concept! Poured into a weissbier glass, pours a beautifully murky brownish orange with a huge, overflowing foamy head. I can count on one hand the number of American brewers who have been able to create the big, billowy head that seemingly all the best German weissbier brewers routinely produce. Clearly Schneiders expertise comes through in a tangible way. High alcohol and hops are the initial impression. Clearly displays the American influence. Peppery. Excellent. My only regret, and its a small one, is that this wasnt a little lower in alcohol which would make it as drinkable in session quantities in the summer as a great German weissbier. Nevertheless, Im guessing Oliver thought of that, but wouldnt have been able to adequately showcase the hops in a lower gravity brew.

Loads of fresh juicy hops in the nose with bright orange and lemon citrus, fresh grass, and pine needles alongside wheat malt and some Bavarian hefeweizen fermentation characteristics.  The flavor is first and foremost hoppy with fresh oranges--though distinctly different than West Coast American hops citrus characteristics--and lush yellow tropical fruits.  This is the finest, most intense, and purest expression of Hallertauer I have ever experienced--so fresh, so bright.  All of this is backed-up by a foundation of wheat malt flavors that totally hide its alcohol--this is muscled finesse.  So unusual.  So good!  Finally a classic European brewery has adopted an American philosophy of hops with wild success.  This is a significant breakthrough.
2nd Tasting - 10/24/07.  The fresh hops have faded a bit and are more integrated into the wheat malt and alcohol flavors--though still contains plenty of lemon and grassiness.

At first, it seems mild, bland even, but mid-sip a smooth fruitiness butts in followed by a very nice floral/perfume/soap character that, thankfully, I ride through the swallow and into a lingering bitter finish.

The first taste is just like a creamsickle. As you near the bottom, its straight up hop juice, and not in a good way. Clumps of everything abound. Now I just couldnt weait for the bottled version. Although filtered a bit more than the draft, I found this to be horribly unbalanced, teetering between sweet and hops. The banana was there and not cloying, so that is good. The hops are there and too citrus juicy to be good. Im guessingt if anyone had this beer without knowing who made it, the ratings wouldnt be so good.

Very drinkable for an 8.2% beer, lots of pleasing hops and just enough of the wheat showing through to make itself known, but not overwhelming banana esters.  This is quickly becoming a favorite.  Ill be curious to see how this progresses with a little age.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
3748,"2007-07-29",3.7,"Bottle. Pours a hazy burnt orange with a large off-white head that lasts leaving good lacing. Aroma of baked spiced apples, bananas, wheat, yeast, clove, bubblegum and spicy hops. Taste is dominated by harsh grassy and spicy hops at first then lends way to bananas, clove, wheat, and yeast. Medium full mouthfeel with a very harsh bitterness and slight warmth from alcohol. An amazing aroma but the flavor is covered up by young grassy hops.  Good but I wouldnt buy it again.","Florida, USA","afterglow"
3748,"2007-07-29",3.8,"appearance- cloudy apple cider, even cloudier. whole loota head, some lacing. aroma- fruit and bread, little apple scent. body- full feel, as expected, not as ""chewy"" as i wouldve expected- think the hops evened out that wheat chew. alcohol is present but relatively hidden for 8+ %. flavor- wheat backround is minimalized by stronger hop bitterness even resin flavor than other wheats. Picture some sort of mixture betweeen a a german wheat and an APA. Main wheat flavors are present, but the subtle ones are lost. The main pale ale characters are there- hops/bitterness giving a pine flavor. even the color is a mixture- short of amber deeper than gold. All in all, i enjoyed. But Im not sure if this is one i can drink a few of exclusively. But it is enjoyable to crack open one bottle and enjoy","USA","mhot55"
3748,"2007-07-29",3.8,"murky greenish/brown(nasty but interesting) colored beer with a large off-white foamy head.  potent aroma of licorice, spices, banana, pink bubblegum and clove.  flavor is of banana, gum, and very unripe green hops that impart a biting bitter quality im not used to.  full bodied.  hint of alcohol in finish.  different than your usual hefe.","","SSSteve"
3748,"2007-07-29",3.4,"Bottle.  Pours a cloudy light orange tinged gold with a soft head on top.  Nose is vanilla scented tropicalfruits with hops.  Flavor is very hoppy which dominates the weizen profile.  There is some unspiced banana bread here as well.  Nice creamy mouthfeel.  I was excited about trying this beer and I guess my expectations fell a bit short.  For me, less hops would have been more pleasing, but still enjoyed.","10aFly, New Jersey, USA","Thaichile"
3748,"2007-07-29",3.6,"Luminescent orange pour of a thick and crazy haze.  Brilliant tropical nose of guava, golden kiwi and pineapple gets boozy and develops a canned attitude with a little warmth.  Tastes of green apple gum and cotton candy, bananas foster and esters.  A little toffee at the end.  Alcohol powers through with a sweet, vanilla vodka strength.  Dry hops finish with a resinous bite that meshes well with everything previous.  Ever so slight in cloying sweetness, more obvious for hotness.  Bombastic thickness of palate.  A bit much.  Refreshing and undeniably interesting, but far from perfect.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
3748,"2007-07-28",3.7,"Im not a big fan of any weisse beer, but I have found ONE that is indeed exceptional.  The nose on this is fantastic with a bit of cloves at the tail end of the nose but definately not too much.  I have never seen a color on beer quite like this, its a cloudy cocoa or mud like character.  It seems thin but does have quite a big dose of alc in it.  The hop character shows throughout and basically overpowers the clove taste that comes in at the end.  Good Beer!!","Chesterfield, Virginia, USA","luv2brew"
3748,"2007-07-28",4.8,"Bottle from pantanap; Nose of wheat, a bit of tartness, banana esters, spices, and some light hops; very cloudy yellowish gold with a big, but quick disappating goldish-white head; flavor is grainy yeast, hop bitterness, banana, peppery spices, and lemon. Great and different hefe!","Bakersfield, California, USA","IrishBoy"
3748,"2007-07-28",4.3,"Pours a light brown color into the Aventinus weizen glass.  The head formed a thick two inches, and was a thing of beauty.  The scent was a nice balance of hops and wheat with notes of citrus, grassy tones.  The taste was very complex with flavors flying all around.  The highlights were yeast, bread, wheat, citrusy hops and some nutmeg.  Perfect mouthfeel and finish.  German hefewiezens are not my favorite style, but this was tremendous.  I absolutely loved this beer.","New Jersey, USA","RiverHorse"
3748,"2007-07-27",4.3,"Pours an unbel;ievably murky and hazy dark brownish color, with a huge head.  Great banana, clove, grapefruit, citrus, yeasty almost farmhouse like fuky spicyness on the nose.  Great creamy and carbonated mouthfeel with a nice dose of white pepper, as well as some banana, plenty of funky spicy grassiness, brown sugar and so much more.  This is a killer summer beer, packed with flavor, and super complex.  So complex that the 8 plus ABV is very well hidden, and could be dangerous.","Farewell Minny; Hello Puyallup, Washington, USA","joebrew"
3748,"2007-07-26",4.4,"500mL bottle.  Pours a murky brown color with a yellowish tinge; gorgeous, fluffy off-white head with perfect retention and lacing; a beautiful pour (to be expected from these fine folks).  Generous, grassy and herbal hop notes in the aroma, coupled with an ester and chewy malt base (overripe fruit and Belgian sugar); excellent combination of hops and hefeweizen character.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: dense, chewy clove and ester core, with a creamy banana presence and plenty of herbal / grassy hops lining the perimeter; perfect use of hops to accentuate what is already a wonderful thing.  My wife: ""can we buy a lot of this?""  Lengthy, chewy clove and herbal finish.  I didnt want this bottle to end.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
3748,"2007-07-26",3.4,"UPDATED: AUG 9, 2007 Pours with lots of carbonation and head.  Dirty looking beer: light brown and cloudy, looks like a chemistry experiment gone wrong. A spicy yet citric aroma, there is a lot of hop aroma here. Flavor has nutmeg and spicy wheat upfront with a big hop flavor afterwards. Very dry finish leaving a bitter taste behind. Reminds me of the Bells Wheat Project. Some mellowing may help this.","New Lenox, Illinois, USA","HopsOrDie"
3748,"2007-07-26",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 23, 2009 Strong nutmeg and cinnamon aroma, bananas and citrus, with some clove.  Pours cloudy dark orange with a HUGE fluffy white head.  So smooth, great citrus wheat flavor, yeasty, clove and nutmeg, a strong hop presence, more than youd find in a hefeweizen normally, hints of some caramel and brown sugar hidden in there.  Pretty meaty, hefty beer, filling.  This is one the best hefeweizens ive ever had.  Normally id go for a Schneider Edel-Weisse but this has all my favorite aspects of that beer, just X2.  Great Beer!","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
3748,"2007-07-25",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 20, 2007 bottle from Liquor Outlet.  very hazy orange in color with a gigantic, swiss cheese like off white head.  Aroma is very hoppy, with spicy, citrus, banana, and light spice notes.  I also get hefe yeast, bread, and light suggestions of wheat in the nose.  Taste is also very hop forward- with floral, perfumy citrus and spicy hops intertwined with banana esters, and alot of wheat.  Hops contribute flavor and not that much bitterness.  Flavors become a bit muddled. Some moderate alcohol warm in the finish,not well hidden.  Body is medium to full, still somewhat refreshing although the alcohol is so high on this beer.  Pretty good, aroma is definitely much nicer than the flavor.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
3748,"2007-07-25",4.0,"Cloudy, foamy weizen pour has a dark copper color and a rich fruity nose that is rounded out by floral hoppiness.  Palate is well-carbonated and approaching full-bodiness.  Flavor is an excellent pairing of the two styles with the wheat banana and clove upfront, subsiding into a lemony tartness, before a full-on hoppy dry finish.  This brew is a great concept and it appears to be nearly flawless in execution. I am partial to both styles and they are wonderfully blended in the hopfen-weisse.","New York, USA","lethe"
3748,"2007-07-23",4.2,"Pours a lighter copper color with an off-white head.  Aroma is of spices, citrus, slight banana, caramel, sweet malts, and just a little bit of alcohol.  An extremely good aroma.  Light on the palate with citrus, nutmeg, and banana up front.  Finishes with a little hop character and some alcohol warming.  A truely amazing hefe.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","Lowe1983"
3748,"2007-07-23",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 16, 2008 Bottle.  Hazy orange-gold color with a foamy white head. Nice aroma - somewhere between a hefeweizen and a triple.  Its got a lot more complexity than a the average hefe.  Good full flavor, but light also.  I cant believe it has 8% alcohol.  Really nice beer.  Rerate - much more floral than I remember.  Fresh and clean, but rich at the same time.  Well brewed.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","nhorween"
3748,"2007-07-22",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 2, 2007 500 Ml Bottle-Hazy orange color w/a moderate white foamy head. This stuff was quite a combo, hard to compare it to anything else Ive ever had. Has a strong hop aroma, but the flavor is of a light floral hop & it mixes surprisingly well with the evedent Hefe flavors of bread dough/yeast, citrus, lime, & banana. You can taste them both in there along w/some flavors of apricott/figs, orange peel, & colander. Full, rich, chewy flavor; very complex w/some good carbonation. Had a lot going on & it all worked well. Very refreshing & easy to drink; alcohol was well hidden. This ones a winner!","Powellville, Maryland, USA","beachbum25"
3748,"2007-07-22",3.8,"500 ml. bottle.  Poured a cloudy, almost murky amber/light brown color, like a bruised apple, with a misbehaved frothy, rocky head.  Rich yeasty aroma--banana, even some cream cheese, on top of shortbread/pastry malt, pear,  and pungent grassy hops.  Flavor at first sip was overwhelmingly boozy, though it settled down a bit to reveal an off-sweet golden muffin/quick bread malt character with a good dose of banana/cheese yeast and associated spice, some general fruit salad notes, and finishing with a pleasantly bitter and snappy vegetal hoppiness- like a raw green bell pepper.  Full yeasty mouthfeel, but lively carbonation also.  Struck me at first as a little ""over the top"" for a HW. I cant stop thinking ""this really doesnt belong in my weizen glass.""   However, I did think the ""Heavy Weizen"" by Southern Tier was really good, and I cant stay too mad at any hop-loaded strong beer, even an experimental style-buster like this. Im looking so forward to the complimentary Brooklyn/stateside version of this one!","Brooklyn, New York, USA","sheatripper"
3748,"2007-07-21",3.0,"An interesting concept, and a heavy, wonderful aroma coming off of this.  However, I dont think I would buy it again.  Theres severe complexity going on here, and it just seemed a bit too much.  A good beer -- and damnit I do love those beers from Brooklyn -- but maybe best paired with a meal to bring out the full flavor.  Otherwise, it didnt inspire me to finish the glass.","Washington DC, USA","beaconstreet"
3748,"2007-07-20",3.8,"Wow only 9 ratings for this beer.  Must be fresh and new.  Pour is murky yellow-brown with a huge white head.  Aroma is floral with lots of piney hops and some pepper.  Flavor is more corrandier with some barnyard and clove.  Pleasing all the sences this is one to look for.  Probably the highest ABV for a hefe you will ever find but that does not get in the way of this wonderful liquid.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
3748,"2007-07-20",4.4,"This ones a looker here. A big fluffy pillow head that is a thing of beauty. The nose is phenolic and hoppy. The palate is light considering this beers strength, but packed with exotic flavors, like banana and orange. I really dig the airy drinkability, much like champagne. Nice stuff, with a hoppy finish. It is the bomb.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","HighGravity"
3748,"2007-07-20",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2008 500 mL Bottle... the very first bottle tasted in Charlottesville, VA (which simply means I had lucky timing). Cloudy, orange-ish amber color with very large and long-lasting head. Aroma is pleasantly sweet... fruity, bubble-gum (in a good way). Taste is very hoppy and pepper, with some sweetness in the background. Finished smoother than is starts. Yeast is very much understated compared to Schneiders solo Hefeweizen effort. Excellent beer.  Rerate 5.6.08 as part of a ""vertical"" with the Brooklyn version. Bottle from WFM Charlottesville. Dark hazy yellow with a medium/small head and good head retention. Aroma of citrus, stone fruit, honey, yeast and hops. Taste is wheat, yeast, banana and bubblegum. Damn good.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
3748,"2007-07-20",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 22, 2007 Pours very murky yellowish-brown with a large foamy tan head. Huge aroma of fresh grassy/piny (almost perfume like) hops, with floral and fruity esters, lots of spice, noticeable alcohol, and just a hint of banana peel. Flavor is doughy upfront with very herbal (mint/basil) hops hitting mid-palate and lasting through the finish. Soft citrus zest throughout, leading to a bitter and spicy finish. Palate is medium, softly effervescent, warming but slightly prickly alcohol in the back of the throat, with a slight white pepper burn, a bit of clove, and grassy bitterness lingering though the very long finish.","Hawthorne, New Jersey, USA","jblendy"
3748,"2007-07-18",4.1,"On tap at Zum Schneider. Hazy yellow golden in color with a nice fluffy white head. Very hoppy and malty aroma. Citrusy, floral, banana and spicy clove notes.  Malty and hoppy flavor. Rich tasting. Fruity peppery notes. Finish is bitter. Sweet.  Medium bodied. Very nice. Drinkable.","paramus, New Jersey, USA","mkobes"
3748,"2007-07-18",4.9,"UPDATED: JUN 8, 2012 500 ml bottle.  Cloudy yellow-brown pour with a thick white head.  The aroma is fantastic... fresh noble hops with zesty citrus, flowers and herbs and a soft dankness set against wheaty citrus acidity, banana, melon and a soft clove and bubble gum character.  I could smell this beer all day.  A touch of black pepper that  becomes much more prominent as the beer warms up.  Flavour is of fresh wheaty spice, herbal/floral hops.  Rich texture, black pepper and soft clove/banana in back of all the hops.  Cotton candy/bubble gum sweetness as well.  Youll have to drink this one fresh because I dont think the hop character will hold up for long, but its pretty awesome right now.  Alcohol is pretty evident, especially as the beer warms up a bit, but Ive got no complaints right now.

Ive had this so many time now and every time I find something else that I absolutely love about it.  Might be one of my favourites and is something that Ill pick up every single time I see it.  Other than the excessive muddiness of the pour theres nothing I could imagine that would improve it.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
3748,"2007-07-17",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 2, 2007 Insanely hopped for a hefeweizen, or even for any beer - smells like, in the immortal words of duff, pencil shavings and flowers, deeply, deeply concentrated. The foam touched my lips and it had the tingling of a hallertau bomb. Mmmm MMMM! Whoa, with the first sip the clash of a bit of sweet cotton candy and hoppy rings out at you, slightly bubblegum and huge clove from the yeast, with an amazing noble hop punch. Incredible inventive, unlike any beer I have ever tried. Flat out dry, yet with that cotton candy sweetness. This beer is a true chimera. Body, while cold, is extremely fizzy, and no traces of thickness (referring to mjs post).","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
3748,"2007-07-15",2.0,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2015 bottle at the brewery, 2015, it smells like acetone and dirty and rotting fruit with lingering off-notes of yeast / paint.  horribly dirty beer.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3748,"2007-07-15",4.0,"Ultra hazy dark gold, monster foamy off-white head.  Hopped up nose of peppery flroals and juicy citrus that sit on subdued waves of banana,vanilla clove, and the slightest hint of pear.  Flavor follows suit with more peppery citric hop tones that softly mingle with fruity banana and clove notes.  Medium bodied, prickly carbonation, drying bitter finish.  Wish more of the wheat character had been present, but otherwise a well made experiment....","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
3748,"2007-07-13",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 18, 2007 Rating after two bottles: Pour was a paler shade of amber, not quite golden, nice initial head, darned hard to get this bottle into my Schneider Weizen glass, foam sucking required to do the job. Hazy body, pretty good lacing, although not among the best. The aroma was interesting, floral, resinous, weedy, grassy, phenolic. Flavor was like one might expect for a beer that builds off of a style not known for hopping and requiring some love and care to create a nice higher octane version: a little over the top on the hops. The fruity esters get killed in this beer by the uber hopping used, really making the wheaty aspects difficult to discern. The base malt is almost pilsner like with a touch of the wheat (or even rye, I could have believed) bitterness, firm noble hopping presence, floral notes, grass and weeds, dandelions, other resinous type hops (yet short of piney!), phenolic yeast biproducts. Alcohol is very soft, done nicely in that regard. Body is full, very grand indeed, enjoyable, hearty, a nice evening drink. If you like hefeweizens and uber/imperial pilsners, youll dig this. Unfortunately, the imperial/strong aspects do drown out some of the finer gentle aspects of the hefe, which I do enjoy quite a bit normally. Great job, Brooklyn/Schneider, you accomplished what you targeted, just didnt work for me personally. The imperial, double, uber Americans over here may dig it just for its boldness, however!","","User37895"
