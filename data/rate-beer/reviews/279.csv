279,"2016-05-29",2.7,"Had their basic junmai at the brewery. Clear. Koji nose. LIght, sweet, ricey taste. Sweet, smooth, very approachable. A bit of alcohol in the finish but the sweetness seems too much, crafted to give it mass appeal.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
279,"2015-08-07",3.0,"Bottle at Craigs. Clear, spirit-looking thing. Much more standard sake deal here. Rice wine, what more can I say?","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","allmyvinyl"

279,"2015-08-06",3.0,"Dull enough white, bit creamy merenge and light peppery lemon. Not boozy at all, passes fine and smooth as silk. Bit floral, I think, not too wholesome.Bottle, Decantillon Tasting","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","McNeillR"

279,"2015-08-01",3.5,"Bottled (from Alko Prisma, Vaasa). Very pale yellow colour, no head. Aroma is citrus, some mild rice wine and a bit dusty and strange sweet notes to it. Flavour is quite interesting, as it has a big palate and mouthfilling feeling to it even when sipping, but there is no real flavour behind the feeling. The aftertaste then again gets a bit earthy, some boiled rice, a bit alcohol and quite strong on the floral notes. As it does warm up a bit, it does get almost a slight vanillaish kick to it.","Vasa, FINLAND","oh6gdx"
279,"2015-03-14",2.6,"Pull top bottle from Bine & Vine. Aroma is fruity with alcohol. Pours clear as water. Rather thick. Flavor is sweet, fair amount of heat, rice and hints of fruit. No fusil oils, which is a good thing. Its an interesting change from beer.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
279,"2014-12-29",1.3,"180ml green pull-tab bottle. took some of this warm and cold. Warm it is terible, boozy and hot, burning alchol. Cold it is again boozy, almost vomit-inducing. Used the rest in a stir-fry and honestly it wasnt as good as usual.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
279,"2014-12-28",3.2,"Sampled at Slurping Turtle Ann Arbor. Pours water like. Aroma has booze and sweet rice, only slightly dry. Flavor is sweet rice throughout, smooth and a bit of booze in the finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
279,"2014-08-23",3.5,"Bottle in Maryland with Linh and family. Pours a clear body with minimal bubbles. Aroma is strong fruity flavors - mostly strawberries and peach. Mouthfeel is a touch hot with the fruit coming through in the form of melon. Nice sweet, fruity sake.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
279,"2014-05-21",2.9,"Clear, pure appearance. A bit alcoholic taste with a hint of rice and some flowers.","FINLAND","siiderikalervo"
279,"2014-01-25",1.9,"18 cl bottle @ home
Totally clear appearance; only viscosity tells it from water. Aroma is quite typical to sake with some rice, sweaty tones and some sweetness. Flavour is boozy with rice, some sweaty tones and hints of grapefruit. Sake is still not my thing and this feels a bit more unclean than the other two sakes Ive had.","Tampere, FINLAND","laiti"
279,"2013-10-22",1.1,"180 ml bottle.
Pours a clear colour. Yes, clear. Aroma of sweet pear juice, wet paper and rice. Flavour of wet rice, cardboard, subtle pear sweetness and sharp tartness. Some solvent-like notes as well. After a while your mouth gets dry with cardboard flavours and you almost dry out. Very light bodied, no carbonation and a sharp finish, with again cardboard. Hard to rate as a beer. Lacks aroma, appearance, flavour and palate completely. The bottle looks nice, though.","Tampere, FINLAND","lusikka"

279,"2009-03-29",3.5,"amazing that i didnt remember liking this sake, but notes dont lie .. clear, decent in the mouth, a good plain sake... will go well with a food item that is light.. .",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"
279,"2009-01-15",1.9,"This is the closest analogue to cup-sake Ive seen in American groceries, and lives up to that reputation.  Its pretty deflating, even mundane.  And sake should never seem mundane.  But the Hakutsuru Tanrei Junmai has all the flavor and vigor of wet cement.  After an effortless tug at the pull cap, I pour the transparent, clear sake into the tokkuri and make an effort to cull the aroma.  Little effusiveness comes up from the sake-ware, and what it does deliver is smooth and dull, barely alive with a soft, whimpering sweet-tart flavor.   Theres hardly even any alcohol bite.  Poorly considered, poorly received.  Hakutsuru has vastly superior sake available.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
279,"2008-06-17",3.1,"Bottle sampled at a sushi bar in Chicago. The body was fairly pale with only a hint of yellowish coloring. The aroma was like dry wood and pears. The taste was up front vanilla with some more woody dryness. A slightly spicy finish. I enjoyed drinking this one cold.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
279,"2007-01-10",3.9,"Ooh man. Drunk cold: Looks like these guys got bad bottles. I got a crystal clear liquid. Wonderful floral nose laced with rice milk and coconut. Subtle alcohol. Very easy drinking. Round body. Tremendous value at $5/bottle.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
279,"2005-07-06",1.1,"This one had the aroma of vinigar and cooking oil. Clear body. This stuff is awful you need to have a grasp on the flavor to appricate this I guess. Not for me.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Bockyhorsey"
279,"2005-06-30",2.6,"My first Sake.

White with the aroma of grain alcohol.
My wife says that is smells like rice wine vinegar.
Smooth mouth feel. Not bad at all, I can detect some fruity flavors. I plan on trying some other varieties.

P.S  Do not heat a shotglass of Sake in a microwave for more than ten seconds... it will explode!!","Arizona, USA","turbo"
