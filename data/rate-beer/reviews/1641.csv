Flavor is the same but looses that slight himt of metal. Big rich full body with softer to average carbonation. This drinks bigger than a sub 6% beer.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"

1641,"2015-11-30",3.7,"Ive pretty much quit drinking stouts these days -- over the summer Ive preferred something lighter, and Ive certainly gotten tired of chasing the next over-the-top imperial with something-or-other.But this one reminds me why I shouldnt go too far toward giving them up. This is really nice. Very dark inky pour, nice rich deep brown head, roasty coffee nose, a bit of ash at first but that fades, hops a little metallic but not bad at all, gentle sweetness coming in late. This is really drinkable and really tasty. I wish I had another one sitting around, or any stout real, but alas. It was a single can lark.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

1641,"2015-01-01",4.0,"Got this from Adam in AK with a couple of his home brews. Thanks!!

Its black, the pour brought a 1 finger head of tan foam that lasts and lasts and when I check my glass after sipping, the lacing is good.

The smell is very roasty with notes of dark chocolate and that certain aroma that tells you that this is an Irish Dry Stout.

Very dry tasting indeed. Loads of roasted malt and some chocolate with a rather stinging bitterness that enforces the dry. It drinks a wee bit stronger than the 5.9% to me but no matter. This is bloody excellent!","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"
1641,"2014-09-20",3.7,"Dark brown, only a little head. Quite a toasty nose, roasty palate, a touch thin bit bringing some nice dark malt character, choc especially, and a fairly hearty bitterness.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

1641,"2014-05-19",3.8,"(Nitro) jet black, thick creamy very fine tan head. Nose of rich coffee, oats, cream, roasted sugar/grains. Taste is not as decadent as the smell, light coffee, medium roasty grain, roasted sugars, creamy body but perhaps a little thin, even for the style. Good dry stout overall though.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
1641,"2014-03-26",3.7,"Nitro at sb. I can certainly live without the nitro. Pours black with a ridiculously dense and slow-settling sandy head. Actually looks like a glass of sand for about five minutes. Quite a spectacle. Dry roasty nose. The usual chalky flat nitro body. Roasty dry mid palate with some baking chocolate. Nice but, well, ya gotta like nitro.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
1641,"2014-03-22",3.9,"Draught, nitro. Pours a near black color with a moderate light tan head on it. Nose is somewhat roasty, like black coffee. Taste is slightly sweet and very roasty, with coffee coming through as well. Not at all bitter, though.","Snohomish, Washington, USA","maxwelldeux"
1641,"2014-03-01",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 28, 2014 The appearance has a black colored body with an off white one fingered foamy head that dies within about a minute leaving a nice sticky foamy lacing. The smell has some roasty light chocolate coming backed up by some malts. The taste is bitter and sweet at separate times with a dry coffee-ish aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, it sits about a medium, and is somewhat sessionable. Carbonation is good for the style and for me as its not too harsh but not too soft, just right.
Overall, I say this is a pretty good Irish dry stout well worthy of coming back to.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

1641,"2011-10-12",3.9,"[Tap] Pint at a restaurant near Denali National Park in early September. Inky black pour with a stout brown head on top. Heavy char and ash in the nose. Lighter milk chocolate and vanilla in the aroma as the beer warms. Burnt malts, wood, espresso, anise and ash throughout. Dry finish. Thick and oily mouthfeel. A really nice surprise. Even though the ABV is low, this is a hearty beer that could keep you warm through the winter.","Illinois, USA","troyc"
1641,"2011-08-09",3.6,"On tap at Talkeetna Roadhouse a few days ago.  Black pour with foamy dark brown head that laced beautifully.  Aroma was well-rounded coffee with loads of chocolate malt and roasted grains.  Flavor and finish fell a touch short, with a good start of coffee but a weak progression into nutty chocolate as the finish felt a bit muddled and overly sweet.  Great for the area, but this one is just a tiny bit off.  If they can address the finish, this would be one heck of a brew!","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","bblack99"

1641,"2011-05-15",3.9,"Draft pint at Humpys in ANC. Awesome look and mouthfeel; creamy head and softest body ever. Nitro btw, but I dont care you Puritans. Served a bit too cold, so the aroma was just a hint of coffee and cocoa. Flavor was nice but hidden a bit also, but the aftertaste showed a great balance of sweetish caramel and chocolate against a slightly more powerful acidity of the roast. Medium-heavy body is dry, watery and highly downable at this temperature.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
1641,"2011-02-07",3.9,"Nitro at Humpys.  Creamy of course.  Nice solid head. Moderately bitter with a charcoal kick to finish.  Nice welcome to Alaska. (#4074, 2/7/2011)","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"

Opaque beer with a foamy brown nitro powered head that left glass coating lace.  Very little nose with some bitter chocolate and black malts.  Nice light nitro moutfeel.  Lots of dusty bitter chocolate, some ash, burnt toast and some sweetened coffee.  There is a hint of something lactic in the back.  Very enjoyable stout.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
