1887,"2017-06-01",3.3,"Bottle from Westmere in Albany, NY.
This was poured into an English pint glass.
The appearance was a cloudy burnt orange color with a fluffy white head that fell off to leave a ton of messy lace.
The aroma had some caramel/biscuit malty dryness, orange marmalade, coriander, light honey and had some grassy bitter ends.
The flavor was mildly malty dry sweet with a little bit of spice trying to make its way into the blend. Aftertaste was all about the malts and that followed into the finish.
The palate was medium bodied with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine, somewhat low, but I get it. ABV felt good.
Overall, seems like an American brewer tried to take an English pale ale to make more interesting for the American market. Me, well, not sure, left me scratching my beard a little bit.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Aroma is a bit odd, orange and coriander for sure, plus caramel, biscuit, honey, cardboard, pepper. Flavor is light sweet and light bitter, interesting enough, a bit of honey and orange zest, not much spice. Lightish body, way too carbonated; let it sit for 20 minutes to enjoy.

1887,"2013-05-14",3.3,"Another tasty one from Pipeworks-- and this time in a variety I dont necessarily usually go for.

This thing is a really nice study in balance.  A place for everything and everything in its place-- certainly unlike some Pipeworks entries.

The nose falls shockingly flat-- practically no smell.

But the taste is wonderfully complex, and very refreshing and drinkable even though it has huge flavor.  I especially love the way it goes from light juicy floral tastes to a crisp, dry finish.

Good stuff.Earlier Rating: 9/29/2012 Total Score: 3.4Another good one from Pipeworks .. . and another really unique one from Pipeworks!

Not familiar with Nelson Sauvin Hops, but glad to make their acquaintance.

WIth this one you get a bit of a dank, stale aroma, and a very wheatey, hefe-ey color, before you get to the taste, which is where all the action is.

Really interesting, clean, distinct hop notes that are sweet and only slightly sharp. . . really not very bitter, with only a bit of sour as well.  Slight saltyness in a light/medium body makes this a really nice drinker.  

Tasty stuff.  Cant wait to try it again, as I really cannot think of another beer close to this one (so I better do my homework).","","BeerSquare"
