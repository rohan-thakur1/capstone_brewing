2219,"2015-12-02",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 30, 2016 Sampled from a bottle, 
the beer had a dark gold pour with red and brown mixed in, there was a little haze (some bottles had more haze than others) and gave a one to two finger very faint off-white cover (bubbles had a faint yellow tint to them) that receded to a thinner layer and ring, 

the nose was malty with melanoidins like notes, a little toasted malt, caramel and some chocolate tootsie roll like notes, some bread, 
it had malt and bread sweetness, the hops were light on the nose, 

the flavors were malty, caramel, faint chocolate that resembled tootsie roll and bready, it had light spice hops, the flavor had some sweetness but not as sweet as the nose, the finish had a light hop bitterness with toasted malt and caramel following, 

it felt light to light medium on the mouth and was creamy, it had soft to average carbonation, 

this beer was on the sweet side for an Octoberfest beer, 
also, and this beer appears to be different than what the Shorts Noble Chaos that was made a few years ago, 
a good drink but not what I was expecting.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

The beer appears dark orange and hazy, with a quarter inch of off white head. The aroma is very pleasant, with malt, fruit, and sugar candies. Pretty sweet, with a cotton candy flavor. Really creamy feel, with a lasting sweetness on the palate. Marshmallows? Medium thin body with adequate carbonation. Pretty good beer. The sweet nature of this brew limits this to one serving for me.

The beer is a deep amber color that shows a lightly hazed, dark copper / amber hue when held up to the light.  The aroma smells amply of caramelized malt, toasted grain and even some ample, for the color, roast character towards the finish.  A touch of lightly spicy and herbal hop notes lie underneath the more dominant malt character and at times gets completely lost within it.

Lightly sweet tasting with a soft herbal hop character up front, but this quickly disappears underneath a soft, but distinctive roasted malt in the finish that tastes a bit like burnt toast, but with out the burnt bitterness.  This is very lightly roasty, but it does have quite a bit more roast character than one would guess by the color of this beer.  The middle has a caramelized malt character that evokes thoughts of berries, this also is ultimately out muscled by the roast character in the finish, but unlike the hops it never quite disappears.  The texture of this beer is nicely appropriate for a beer for the Autumn, it is a touch chewy and has some a character that leaves it lightly clinging viscously to the palate.

What a weird beer; it is interesting and tasty, but the roast character keeps throwing me off for some reason, it doesnt really seem to mesh with the rest of the beer.  Still, I am definitely enjoying this beer, it just might have a bit too much roast character.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2219,"2010-09-03",1.2,"Not a well balanced beer.  Too much IBU for the style and a thin malt presence.  Very unpleasant floral detergent aftertaste.  At $11.99 for a six pack, this beer is incredibly overpriced.  Definitely try a single first.","Farmington Hills, Michigan, USA","jhulett"
2219,"2010-08-28",3.1,"OK, but nothing outstanding. Above average for an Oktoberfest, but pretty average for a Shorts Brew.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","milewide"
2219,"2010-08-24",3.3,"Bottle. Pours a clear amber with a slight maple hue and a tan head that dissipated completely. Aroma has a relatively strong caramel note with a bit of roast and bread. Flavor begins sweet with caramel but mellows a roasted malts grow with a bread note.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
2219,"2010-08-21",3.4,"12 oz bottle.  Pours amber with an off-white head.  Aroma is very nutty (peanut buttery specifically) and earthy with notes of caramel and dark fruit.  Peanutty and toasty malt flavors blend with earthiness and bits of dark fruit and hop hints.  Alcohol is just slightly more apparent than it probably should be for the ABV, but this is a nice version of the style.","Northville, Michigan, USA","flatmatt"

Bottle:  The aroma consists of moderate chocolate, caramel, and some spicy hops.  It pours a slightly hazy brownish-orange with an off-white head that has okay retention.  The flavor starts with lots of chocolate and caramel.  The finish has light-moderate earthy and spicy hops along with some light roastiness.  Medium bodied with soft carbonation and mouthfeel.  This comes across more like a malty Brown Ale.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

2219,"2010-08-21",0.6,"Bottle.  Aroma has notes of infection.  Medium amber hue with a small off-white head that fully diminished and left no lace.  Flavor is undrinkable, completely infected(no surprise there from Shorts)  Palate is thin and watery with average carbonation.  Overall another infected bottle from Shorts.  I hate this crap.","Saginaw, Michigan, USA","polomagnifico"
2219,"2010-08-20",3.0,"Pours red-tinged copper, moderate head.  Nose of caramel and chocolate malt, slight hoppiness.  Flavor is all bitter up front, that or rancid malt flavors.  Tastes spoiled, I cant imagine a Marzen deliberately tasting like this. Not a fan.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","RyanMM"
2219,"2010-08-19",2.9,"This interesting oktoberfest has a very intricate malt profile that is well balanced by aromatic, though slightly harsh, noble hops.  However, it seems almost more like a lighter American IPA than an oktoberfest - its a bit strong on the hops and a bit light on the malt.  Solid amber color, slightly hazy.  Small, short-lived head.  Aromas of roasted malt, bready malt, chocolate, grain, finishing with a sharp and dusty hop aroma.  Nice.  Flavor is unbalanced for the style, being more bitter than sweet, and the finish is dry.  A good beer, but not quite what was expected.  Try a single before getting a six-pack.","Michigan, USA","jodah52"
2219,"2010-08-19",4.0,"12 oz bottle:  Aroma has a really nice grainy and malty texture to it.  Caramel, roast, light banana and spice are the most prevelent scents.  Appearance is a very cloudy orangish brown with a medium slightly off white head.  Taste has got a really nice an complex texture, malt, grain, light fruit, hops, and spice are intermingled together quite well.  Palate is medium carbonation and a light roasted malt aftertaste that is enjoyable.  Overall. I think this is a really nice and proper to style Oktoberfest beers.  Cheers!","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","demitriustown"
2219,"2009-10-06",3.8,"tap at hopcat...so good i had to break my 8 month(ish) rating drought.  pours a nice crisp amber color with a thick white head.  aroma is mild citrus, slightly spicy, light caramel in the back.  flavor is very malt forward, caramel, biscuit, and a timy bit of raisin...followed by a huge hop kick...bitterness, lots of spice and citrus in the flavor.  great lacing on the glass throughout the beer, well retained head.  overall, i could definately drink this beer every day.  well balanced, yet interesting enough to keep you wanting more...congrats shorts on another wonderful beer!","hooterville, Michigan, USA","jeffwilliams11"
2219,"2008-10-22",3.5,"On draft hazzy darkish bronze color.  Smell of wheat sweetness.  Nice medium malty boddy.  Suprised by the tangy hop finish.","West Bloomfield, Michigan, USA","gearbike"
2219,"2008-07-20",3.3,"Draft at Hopcat. Poured clear copper color with an average frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate toasted sweet malt aroma.

2219,"2007-11-28",3.2,"On tap at Ashleys.  Pours a somewhat transparent, dark ruddy cherrywood color with a thin, wispy layer of off-white head.  Quite dark for an Oktoberfest, and the aroma shows it, too.  Lots of caramel and light chocolate going on, along with notes of prune flesh and some nutty, woody bark.  Smells a bit dark, heavy, and astringent, and the palate reveals this is no misconception.  Medium bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel.  A pleasant amount of chewy malt up front, and while not overly sweet, it has this dark, borderline roasty, woody astringency that makes this taste a bit more in the lines of a bock.  Plenty of caramel and dark malt qualities, but not much Munich malt flavor.  Finishes dry, with more of that woody astringency and a kiss of noble hops on the back end.  Drinkable and somewhat enjoyable, but not to style.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
2219,"2007-11-20",3.7,"UPDATED: SEP 18, 2010 On tap at Ashleys - Ann Arbor, MI. Aroma is a muddling of grain sugars, earthy spice and nips of Munich. Pours a middle brown, clouded and with tinted head. Flavor is a mostly generic bread malt, with rather gummy hops, a bouquet of light estery fruits, and a earthy chocolate touches. A certain tint of more caramelized or dark Munich malt, which is interesting. Not your typical Munich flavor, this has been messed with (no way...). Finishes dry and clean, with a good tooth of the gummy hops. When i had this, I had no idea what style it was, and I regarded it as a rather generic middle malt beer. So, as a Marzen, that makes sense and it doesnt do a terrible job, but it could have clarified the malt profile and lager output a little bit.


12oz Bottle. Thanks, Sean! Ah, relief.  Big cheerios and whole grain nose, full of classic O-fest malts. Translucent orange pour with a tan head. Flavors are generally sweet and well-defined, but show above-average hoppiness for the style, which Im enjoying. Fresh, clean, malty and bright. A nice change of pace from the last two beers. Having had this twice now, Im starting to see it as a classic Michigan Oktoberfest.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
2219,"2007-02-21",2.8,"Pours a gorgeous cloudy orange gold.  Smells of banana and wheat, more like a wheat then a marzen to me.  Tasted very metallic and bready.  It had a strange aftertaste.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","Hawksfan17"
