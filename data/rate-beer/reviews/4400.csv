4400,"2014-07-30",3.5,"On draft at Fat Heads Brewers Brawl

This had been widely available on the Cleveland area for a month or so now. After trying a sample pour I might have to get a pint. A very interesting experiment, this collaboration with Cigar City shows hallmarks of both breweries trademark styles.

Aroma / Appearance - A reddish black base with a fringe of vanilla tickles the edges of the glass. Chewed half melted chocolate tinges the air with a sweet feel along with the dry feel of desert air.

Flavor / Palate - Chocolate, coffee, and almonds immediate brighten up the palate. A soft mouthfeel enriches the texture with a splash of carbonation, ice cream, and coffee. Building to a slow crescendo, this draft takes time to really open up. I would love to try it side by side with the Cigar City version to see what the differences are.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

4400,"2014-07-08",4.1,"An interesting one. Rich, slightly roasty aroma (much less than Edmund Fitzgerald though, which I sampled side-by-side). Alcohol content is well-masked, and, although it is a bit rich and heavy, still tastes lighter than most dark beers with similarly high ABV. Not particularly hoppy, but the hops have a light character which I think may contribute to the lighter flavor. Good and interesting to try for a change of pace, but I still strongly prefer the good old Edmund Fitzgerald and I cant see regularly drinking this one when that beer is also on tap.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","cazort"

A solid layer of head is left on the surface throughout the drink and a puffy sheet-like lace is left down the glass. Its a medium high sweet taste with a supporting medium bitterness. The texture is a smooth, oily quality with an abundant and soft carbonation. The medium full body starts with a chocolate syrup flavor, with a sweet stone fruit note, but this drops off quickly and it finishes relatively clean.

Much less sweet than expected, good hoppy bitterness keeps things crisp. Nice floral hop aroma, some dark fruit, good bigger dark chocolate, mild roast, hint of coffee. Good complex tasty aroma, with a moderate longer dark aftertaste. Nice, surprisingly easy-drinking, strong hoppy flavorful schwarzbier. Or Black IPL? [EDIT] Went back for more several times later. How refreshing this is seems to vary on my mood and palate. Notice more dark fruit and sweetness than from the first pours, but as long as its cold it doesnt bother me much.
