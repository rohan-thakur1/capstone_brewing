604,"2014-11-17",3.3,"180 ml bottle. Crystal clear, looks like water. Flavors of cedar, floral, rice pudding, a bit sweet, and light peppery. Enjoyable.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
604,"2014-02-17",3.9,"Nice surprise pickup. Nice nose for a sake pretty full of fresh garden, melon, and rice. Tastes of ripened honeydew, light cedar, rice, grass, and some vanilla. Finish the wood and melon hit you again. Really nice.","New York, USA","Jow"
604,"2014-01-01",2.6,"Bottle. Clear slight yellow pour. Wood, black pepper, green apple, rice. Not too sweet, and decent complexity and depth for a junmai. Easy to drink, and while the taru aroma is weak, this is a decent option to have on New Year while having osechi. Will not wow anyone but will not offend most.","New Jersey, USA","Tonkun"
604,"2013-11-07",4.0,"180 ml bottle sample served in a glass inside a small cedar box filled with sake, with a small pile of salt on one corner. Nice presentation. Aroma of cedar, flowers. Taste is resiny, slightly vinous cedar. I wasnt quite sure what to do with the salt, but a tiny bit slipped into the last sip and was a great combination, earthiness contrasted to the vinous drink. Very nice.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
604,"2013-07-13",3.6,"I am a big fan of Sake and since a friend of us -Cassio- brought some really nice ones directly from Japan, even more. Ive bought this one in an Asian store and paid half a fortune for it, but luckily it was worth every single penny. It has got a clear very light vanilla / crème colour with medium to thin body. Nose of white pepper and roses. Taste of white pepper, mild red apples, spices, herbs, thyme mand flowers. Flowery and smooth finish. I enjoyed this Sake a lot. It tastes superb and delicious, more like a perfume.","Reutlingen, GERMANY","McTapps"
604,"2013-07-13",3.5,"How crazy this one is ! Even in the nose you just smell pepper. Pepper all the way, including the taste before that wonderful sake goes down your throat. Maybe a bit one-dimensional but full body and big aftertaste.","Wanne-Eickel, GERMANY","MichaelAwesome"
604,"2013-06-23",3.7,"Aroma is cedar, rice pudding, spring flowers. Pours crystal clear with a yellow tinge. Smooth palate, full body, slight booze burn on the finish. Taste is cherry stone, cedar, polished rice. Very enjoyable","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","GothGargoyle"
604,"2012-04-18",3.6,"Botella. ""Tokusen Taruzake"". Totally clear colour. Aroma of rice and fruityness and herbal woody like with alcohol. Ok mouthfeel.Flavour is fruity rice with some spiciness to it, herbal and strong wood with alcohol, rice and ya pepper. Dry woody herbal rice alco finish.  Nice.","FAROE ISLANDS","faroeviking"
604,"2011-08-11",3.8,"300mL Bottle, purchased at the amazing Brookline Liquor Mart - Boston, MA. Looks like Im joining everyone else in ticking Taru-sake here. I find this tipple quite enjoyable. The finish has a spicy, peppery, funky Tequila-like note, that Im guessing comes from the Yoshino cedar casks. Lacks the painful alcohol heat and sugar grossness I expect from so many low-brow sakes. Decent.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
604,"2011-04-07",3.7,"Moderate spicy aroma. Clear color. Spicy flavor throughout. Similar to a light tequilla burn.","Waterbury, Connecticut, USA","rocbyter"
604,"2010-12-03",3.8,"Bottle.  Pours clear with a yellow tinge.  I get the cedar right away and I love it.  Followed up with some very faint musk melon and warm rice. Nice umami notes as it warms.  Very gentle with some more melon, a little bit of rice porridge and  the cedar makes another appearance.  It shows up again as it helps dry out the finish with some big long wood.  Uh huh huh.  I said big long wood.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
604,"2010-06-30",3.6,"Bottled. Funny how my notes take on a British character when I write them in EnglandIve described the aroma as ""ace,"" a world I certainly never use over here in the States. A fair assessment, though, the aroma on this was lovely, bursting with fresh garden aromas, mountain fields in the springtime; some vanilla, oak, violet, lavender. The flavor is more restrained, with melon, bubblegum. Little to no koji. A touch of cedar to round this out. Great sake.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
604,"2010-05-31",2.7,"Clear pale silver-gray tint. Aroma of straightforward coconut palm, dry, mild, with just the slightest tint of white fruit flesh. The palate seems much harsher in comparison, with a jolt of grain alcohol that takes some time to burn off. Watery, and not as complex as I would like. Brash, it evaporates quite quickly off the tongue. Flavors include underripe pear that has just developed some sugars. Dry finish. Its stark and austere but it grew on me.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
604,"2010-05-31",3.2,"Slightly greenish-yellow and quite pale.  The aroma is koji, a little bit of wood and a fair bit of alcohol.  Woody taste with a sweetish, hot finish.  The aftertaste is more woody than most sakes Ive had.  This has a fairly hard mouthfeel but is generally clean and drinkable.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
604,"2010-05-27",4.0,"A Mes rate. Bottle thanks to Craig, via Chris.Smells absolutely amazing. Cedar, flowers, alcohol, pear drop kiddies sweets, lemon, faint nail polish, shit the bed, this is all over the place. Taste is the same but with a hit of chilly and lime plus some rosemary and corn. Amazing, Craig, this shows me why you have developed a love for sake. Cheers our kid.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
604,"2010-05-24",3.2,"Bottle 300ml.Clear cristal clear color with virtually none head. Aroma is moderate rice, moderate to light heavy flowers - pollen, white pepper (ceder), wood - oak notes, light sharp alcohol. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet with a long duration, flowers, peppery - wood (cedar), glue notes . Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is flat, finish feel is light to moderate alcoholic.

604,"2010-05-23",3.1,"bottle at chris-o ... clear but not the same life look as the stunning earlier one ..light soft floral nose ... soft mellow rice ... rougher front ... little alcohol ....light sweet condensed milk","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","cgarvieuk"
604,"2010-02-27",1.1,"Marcipan aroma. Clear watery body. Moderate sweet flavor. Light to medium and oily palate.","Langå, DENMARK","cheeta"
604,"2010-01-15",2.3,"Bottle. Clear watery colour. Slightly marcipan aroma. Strange flavor. Oily palate. Average finish. Weird experience.","Randers, DENMARK","HenrikSoegaard"
604,"2010-01-15",1.1,"bottle., color pale, liquid clear, no head., taste heavily sour, finish baaaaaaaaaaaaa","DENMARK","jessoj"
604,"2010-01-15",2.7,"Bottle. Well its a light clear colour like all sake. Aroma is fine flavour is rice destilled sake. But I kinda like this one","Magellan Hunter!","onystrom"
604,"2010-01-15",1.4,"Bottle. No head. Color is pale yellow. Aroma and taste are alcohol, water and alcohol","Højbjerg, Aarhus, DENMARK","saxo"
604,"2009-02-27",3.5,"Bottle at Sake & Co, Amsterdam. Clear. Herbal, a bit alcoholic. Dry herbal flavours. Wood and pine; the storage in cedar woods shines through. For sure different with its cedar wood impact.","Oslo, NORWAY","thebeertourist"
604,"2008-12-27",3.4,"Bottle thanks to bman113vr.  Smell is alcohol, hot, caramel, butterscotch.  Look is clear, yellowish color.  taste is plain, alcohol, slight fruit, and some body.","Dallas, Texas, USA","travita"
604,"2008-12-25",3.4,"(Bottle, courtesy of BMan1113VR)  Pours a clear body with a lightly yellowish hue.  Aroma of cedar, florals, vanilla, light pesticide, and alcohol.  Flavor of cedar, touch of granny smith apples, and alcohol.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
604,"2008-11-15",3.3,"bottle thanks to bman113vr.  pours like water with a slight yellow color.  scent of cedar and vanilla.  quite smooth on the palate with a big cedar/vanilla flavor.  smooth finish and a nice alcohol warmth on the way down.","Dallas, Texas, USA","mar"
604,"2008-09-02",3.1,"Thanks to BMan1113VR for finding this for me. Pours like water with a sigular drop of yellow food coloring added to it. Nose is exactly like poultry bullion cubes with seasoning. I got some leather and cedar (kind of like a shoe tree) at first but it blows off quickly and requires a swirl to pick it up again, also a bit of petrol. Taste is salty, pears, mineral oil, faint honey dew and there is a bit of an unpleasant sort of rubbing alcohol (medicinal) harsh finish. Interesting and difficult to judge being my first Taru.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
604,"2008-05-14",3.2,"UPDATED: SEP 2, 2008 First example of the style for me. Pours with a pale, yellow tinge. Weak legs. Aroma is light, somewhat earthy with vanilla and maybe apple. Taste is woody, light, then alcohol, and somehow finishes somewhat balanced. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side. The sake is crisp, but not fruity at all. I dont really like the style, as the wood elements neutralize all the fruit elements and thus leave a magnified alcohol taste. Nice if you like rubbing alcohol.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
604,"2008-04-06",3.7,"300 ml bottle from City Market in Burlington VT (March 2008), served cold from a White Winter Winery glass.  Utterly clear with a faint oiliness, minimal but lasting legs in the glass....spicy, vaguely nutty aroma is rather subdued, cedary character takes a little while to show up....moderately sweet on the palate, the woody characteristic is much more pronounced, giving it both sap-like and spicy/pungent flavors....alcohol is barely present, and this is perhaps the first sake Ive had that seems to improve a little with warmth.  My first taru sake, and Im rather impressed.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
604,"2008-02-12",3.2,"Pretty good, not too much cedar flavor, just enough to add some interest.  Just a tiny hint of heat on the finish.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","RCL"
604,"2007-10-08",3.2,"Just a hint of color, could be the light or this is as close as you can get to colorless without actually being so. Cedar scent with a trace of koji. Odd, smells a bit like one of those aftershaves you got as a kid. Fortunately it tastes much better (Im guessing here, I never really tasted those Avon aftershaves in the car shaped bottles) the flavor is cedar, it becomes more noticeable as the sake warms. This is what sake must have tasted like back in the Samurai era, stored and drank from Cedar containers. As an added bonus, my girlfriend really likes this one! ;-)
My thanks to her for translating the bottle so I could find this one!","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"
604,"2006-09-21",3.2,"bottle. pour is s bit oily yellow and clear, like some parafin ive seen. aroma is striking, pepper, lots of it, butter, alcohol, and yes, the cedar is here too, it is really quite dominant.  really delicate flavors that i am having a bit of a tussle with to describe, sure there is obviously some alcohol bite, but there is some cedar, bnot over powering, just hanging around and doing its thing. some rose water notes, really reminds me of unseasoned scallops. light fruitiness comes oput in the finish. not bad, a bit more ""different"" than suits me right now.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
604,"2006-08-30",3.1,"Served cold; in the restaurant it was called Nume, but the bottle looks like thisThe aroma is lightly fruity; its strange to find here a Madeira wine character. The flavor is full, with a minimum alcohol punch, light fruitness, a bit salty, quite well blended. The final is warming, with light bitterness and an aftertaste of watermelon seeds.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
604,"2005-12-19",3.3,"A clear sake. The aroma is sweet alcohol with strong flowery notes as well as light citrus notes. The flavor is sweet and very mild for a Sake, though with a bite from the alcohol in the end, that finally resides and gives way for a fruity after taste.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
604,"2003-12-11",3.5,"Taru sake is an odd style and one you don't see so much.  The aging in cypress casks imparts a pleasing, woody aroma and softens the edges of less-expensive sake such as this.  It's not the least bit astringent and the alcohol, while noticeable, is masked behind the rich, fullness of the drink.  Kiku-Masamune is a respected Japanese brewer ranking as one of the larger breweries in Japan, and it's great that they bother to brew a taru sake.  Basically, this is an inexpensive sake that delivers a smooth, buttery taste in excess of its modest price.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
