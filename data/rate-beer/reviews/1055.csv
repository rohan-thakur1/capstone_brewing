Again the Bordelet mushroom-shaped cork. Opens with a puff and pours amply carbonated into my cider glass. The nose is divine: all the sweetness and essence of roast pears, vanilla oak behind it. Its just amazing that pearness can be so intensely concentrated like this. It threatens, though, to be very sweet -- yet upon tasting it, this is not at all the case. Its refreshingly tart, not without sugars, but crisp. Again, delicious pear flavors, what seems like some green apple as well. Quite ample carbonation, remarkably intense for 4% ABV.

1055,"2011-11-08",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2011 I was finally able to make it to Zips to grab a bottle of this stuff, Id been waiting a while to try this. The cork on this bottle was marked 2005. 

It pours a beautiful perfectly clear golden color with a medium well retained head that leaves some nice lace on the glass. 

The aroma is wet wood, some of that funky character you get form tequila, plenty of aromatic sweet pear, a bit of perfume, and ripe red apples. 

The flavor is tart, semi-sweet with a dry finish this retains some of the sweetness of the pears without being overly sweet or fruity. There are some woody and beautiful earthy tones as well as flavors reminiscent of ripe red apples. Im not sure what the 2005 on the cork means, was it bottled in 05 or pressed in 05? Either way Im amazed at the brightness and freshness of fruit flavor here... this does not seem like a 6 year old bottle of anything. 

This has a beautiful sensation on the palate, lightly bubbly but still viscous and tongue coating, so big with a hint of sharpness. 

Stunning, I must get another bottle or two.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

First, its not nearly as saturated as most local perries. Disciplined, coaxing acid. Bright pear juice & some softer apple-like qualities. Not much tartness.

Pours clear straw with a small white head that quickly fades, leaving a tiny amount of lace. The aroma is of ripe pear with a faint hint of yeasty oak barrels. The flavour starts out moderately sour and slightly bitter, but a delicate sweetness gradually takes over. It is also moderately acidic and fairly crisp. The finish is sweet and delicate, the acidity having faded away completely. On the palate, it is light-medium in body with a crisp, acidic character and soft carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent demi-sec pear cider with a delicate carbonation. Very precisely crafted.

Medium-to-full mouthfeel: good levels of carbonation (not as spritzy as it looks), medium-to-high levels of acidity, moderately dry; a gorgeous presentation of the pear: crisp, juicy, with honeyed overtones and floral / vanilla notes, everything dried out with that delightful Champagne-like mustiness from the yeast; theres a light tartness permeating all of this; very much like a low-proof, pear-infused sparkling wine; quite lovely and about as good as I can imagine a pear cider tasting.

Bought @ Kolding Vinhandel.
[vintage 2000]
Pours clear golden with next to no head. Aroma is woody, dry, apples and a slight touch of sweet pear. Nice, oily mouthfeel with limited carbonation. Flavour is dry, tartish apple with sweeter notes from the pear. Wonderful fruity and oaky dryness.","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"
1055,"2008-05-19",3.5,"Bottled. Tasting @ Kolding Bryglaug. Aroma has pear and oakinesss. Clear, golden coloured perry with no head. Taste is sweet  and has oak and some tartness as well. Nice balanced clean taste. Good perry I would say.","Baarn, NETHERLANDS","skortila"
1055,"2008-03-13",3.8,"Sent in a photo to be uploaded. Pours a gentile yellow color with a nice ring around the glass and some lacing. Aroma is of pear and is very clean and crisp compared to others. Taste is of sweet pairs with a dryness in the back, not cloying in the slightest. Nice mouthfeel, light bubbles and a refreshing dryness. A bit expensive at 13 (also considering my bottle was marked at only 3% abv).","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1055,"2008-03-09",4.3,"Clear straw golden body with a green shine, beautiful lasting white head; Very nice clear pear nose, both peel and meat, softer layers behind, oak and yeast; Super balanced small bubbled carbonation, perfectly balanced sweet fruity acid body; Very long very fruity acid finish, great complexity and great aromas. Amazingly big, yet still super elegant and balanced, overly dry and overly sweet at the same time both regarding body and nose.","Aarhus, DENMARK","henrikb"
1055,"2007-12-25",3.8,"This hidden gem pours a crystal clear, light golden color.  Though lightly carbonated, well disbursed micro-bubbles race towards the surface.  The aroma is like a sweet reduction of freshly crushed pears and apples, with perhaps just a solitary drop of white grape juice for tartness.  The flavor follows suit, with concentrated fresh pears and sweet green apples comprising the bulk of the taste, and tart Granny Smith apples and white grapes adding a significant and much welcomed tangy element.  Very sweet overall, though sufficiently tart to hold my interest well.  The carbonation is almost perfect on the palate.  Feels very light and dangerously drinkable.  Not at all sticky or annoying.  This would be an excellent, lighter alternative to champagne or prosecco on a hot summers day.  Very nice stuff.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1055,"2007-12-04",3.3,"Bottle.  Golden beer with a strongly fruity and peary aroma.  The flavour is quite tart and smoothish.  Overall a reasonable drink.","Leicestershire, ENGLAND","RichardGretton"
1055,"2007-11-02",3.7,"A very sweet cider.  The aroma has pear, yeast, and apple.  The flavor is intensely sweet but more from fructose and natural sugar rather than any additives.  Abundant apple as well, and it is a little sour.  Well carbonated, and gold in color, but I would have liked to see some sediment, but that is only my personal preference.  This is a very good dessert drink.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
1055,"2007-11-01",3.6,"Bottle. Along with the initial pear must on the aroma, I get a mild not of caramel covered apples. Pours pale yellow with lively carbonation. Very crisp and refreshing pear flacor. Sweet, but balanced by a nice tartness. Medium bodied with excellent carbonation.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
1055,"2006-07-11",3.9,"Clear pale yellow body with a quickly disappearing cap of bubbles posing as a head.  The aroma is sweet pear and very inviting.  Perhaps slight notes of wood, but pear dominates.  Gentle carbonation, smooth feel in the mouth.  Typical cider texture.  The flavor leaned towards the sweet but not cloyingly so.  Very refreshing pear flavor.  This was an enjoyable, tasty drink that would go well with many cheese offrerings.  Delicious.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
1055,"2006-02-07",3.7,"Gold color with a fizzy white head.  Aroma is defintely pear with a kind of meadow-ish finish.  Pear is the dominant flavor and easily overwhelms any apple that might be there.  Its about equal parts sweet and dry: not soul-sucking dry, not candy-factory sweet, just a nice balance.  Heavy carbonation.  Easily the best pear cider Ive ever had.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
1055,"2005-01-23",3.4,"2002 bottle. Virtually no head. Body is clear medium yellow. Aroma is notes of apple, pear, grass, cask wood, flowers. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Could stand to be drier, and its not as rich with pear aroma as expected (almost smells like an apple/pear blend), but its pretty elegant and clean.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
