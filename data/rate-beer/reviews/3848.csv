3848,"2017-06-22",4.4,"On the nose there is more citrus aroma out of the can, more dankness from the tulip. Going down the hatch: medium caramel backbone followed by a brief hint of miso, then grapefruit, pear and melon which are about the same from both vessels. More pine from the can. Bitterness is just right. Cloudy, looks chew but its not and I love the floaties. A little oily but still finishes clean. Differences are subtle, you cant loose either straight from the can or a tulip glass. A lot going on but it all comes together superbly.  A must try and one of the best.","Pocasset, Massachusetts, USA","growler6"
3848,"2017-06-11",4.5,"Aroma:

Medium/heavy aroma of malts, caramel, orange, tropical fruit and hops.

Appearance:

Turbid yellow/golden beer with heavy yeast and with a slight off-white/beige head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium/heavy sweet with malts, caramel, orange and tropical fruit; ends slightly bitter and dry with hops.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. This is especially true for its abv. Lovely sweet flavour full of fruit; with a tat of bitter hops in the finish. The aroma is almost perfect, but the taste is absolutely insane. Great appearance and palate as well.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Edge of butterscotch to the nose, but otherwise danky fresh green hop cone. Pretty full mouthfeel for the abv. Orange, creamsicle too on nose. Julie says lemons and meadows too.

Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity/earthy hop and moderate pale malt flavors; with an amazing malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from lingering bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, bready/grainy/creamy/sticky, and lightly resinous/rindy mouthfeel that is insane. Perfectly balanced. Zero warming alcohol for 7%. Overall this is an amazing IPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity/earthy hop and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and pretty refreshing to drink. Super dank and fairly juicy on hops; just enough malt for bitter balance, with minimal residual sweetness. One of the smoothest IPAs Ive ever drank.

Was lucky enough to get 10 pretty sweet beers sent to me by a college buddy. Was really looking forward to this one, having head Heady Topper a few times. Thinking this would have to be in the 4.50 range.

Poured a light yellow hazy color with three fingers of rocky white head. Lots of light bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Good foamy spotty lacing. Excellent foamy retention. (Sight - 4.00)

Smelled juicy mix of citrus and tropical from the first whiff. Got Citra up front, followed by grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, subdued Mosaic, melon, mango, pine and herbal. Started out awesome, but flavor escaped rather quickly. (Smell - 4.25)

Tasted slightly better and more flavorful than the nose. Really and extension of the first whiffs. Got Citra, mango, pineapple, grapefruit pulp, bitter tangerine peel, melon, sharp pine, subdued Mosaic, herbal and hints of menthol. Tastes maybe even more than the 7 pct. ABV. (Taste - 4.50)

Medium body. Oily texture. Lively-to-fizzy carbonation. Juicy bitter finish. (Feel - 3.75)

The nose is enticing- raw, fresh hops- in your face hops- almost like if you opened a bag of hop pellets and inhaled deeply. FRESH hoppy nose with some malty notes in the backgroud- bread, biscuit, maybe banana or cream? with yeasty notes of goat dung and a distinct barnyard note. Reminds me of an ex girlfriends farm family, but whatever. The palate disappoints me a little. A very bitter, almost sour finish follows a somewhat hollow fore and mid palate. Its not unpleasant. Reminds me of a Cabernet with an explosive nose but no substance to the taste.","","laminarman"

Very characterful stuff. The nose is ambivalent for me, theres a lot going on, diverse fruits, pine and floral notes, but there are also dank, almost vomit like notes I dont like much. Taste is just lovely though, with the complexity of the nose, but without the dank notes and greatly balanced between juiciness and pine.

Downed after instructions from the can during Max Goldt live. - Citric tea granulate hop pellet greenness & dankness remind me of a summery home-dryhopped ice tea, with an older hop cheesy edge to them (young lambic). Herbal and citrus peel dominate upfront in flavour, adding in both earthy and again some cheesy resins, going into nettle, melissa and even marijuana dankness. Lively carbonation gives it a metallic edge...very decent standard, just harder to taste this as the baseline to the masterful Heady Topper at only 1% less ABV.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

3848,"2016-10-23",4.3,"The little brother of the famed Heady Topper, big cheers to Ster for offering me the can. Thick, densely moussy, frothy, stable, egg-white head over an initially warm old golden blonde beer with fierce sparkling and some yeast bits here and there, hugely increasing in numbers at the end, eventually lending the beer a muddy, ochre-hued, milky appearance. Lively and fragrant bouquet of lime juice, sugared lemon, ripe mango, sweet onions, mandarin peel, freshly cut green bell peppers, crackers, tonic water, minerals, bitter honey, unripe pineapple and a light hint of spruce. Vividly fruity flavor, very crisp, with sourish redcurrant and green plum-like impressions mingled with sweeter mango, starfruit and light banana, fizzy carbo, smooth oily mouthfeel. Lightly biscuity malt sweet middle with a sharper grainy edge to it, perfectly supporting the star of the show, making its entrance at an early stage: a wealth of aromatic hoppiness, with a ton of retronasal citrus, mango and green banana as well as a piney accent; in the mouth, a deeply grapefruity, strong, resinous bitterness is established, drying the back of the mouth to a large extent but letting just a trace of sweet maltiness pass through in the end, keeping the finish juicy. As with Heady Topper, the brewer recommends ""drink from the can"", but obviously that would not serve this beer right: this is a modern IPA of utmost balance, elegance and finesse, in which all the components are perfectly dosed, much like in its big brother. Glad I finally tasted this, a beautiful example of this brewerys quality standard.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Add in a good dose of rich, honey-like maltiness and zero resin/pine, clean yeast and no alcohol and youve got yourself a highly enjoyable, top-tier NE IPA.Continued softness and juiciness in flavor and texture, as tight carbonation keeps up a good effervescence, helping keep the palate free from fatigue and brightening the finish.

Je mattends ainsi à peu de sucres résiduels et jai raison car le liquide, de ses 7% dalcool est plutôt mince et sec. Sans être une bière sèche au sens propre du terme, le houblon attaque la bouche puis combiné à une forte effervescence et une minéralité due à la canette, se retire rapidement en ne laissant quune légère amertume en bouche.

Smooth, fairly rich palate that stays fresh and drinkable. Gets more resinous toward the end. Finishes long, zesty bitter, with that lip sticking sweetness staying the course. Nice one.","Sheffield, South Yorkshire, ENGLAND","Garrold"
3848,"2015-11-19",4.3,"Pours a cloudy, initially very carbonated yellowish golden with a bubbly white head, that recedes quickly. The aroma contains floral hops, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, and a little bit of orange. Very tropical nose overall. The taste is quite bitter, very dry, with just a touch of sweetness. Its heavy on grapefruit with a compliment of pine. Undertones are floral hops, orange and peach. The aftertaste is a long and bitter grapefruit flavor. Light to medium in body, very sticky in texture, and lots of carbonation in here. This is delicious. Even though Id classify this at just a notch below Heady Topper, this is one of the best IPAs Ive tried.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"

3848,"2015-07-22",4.9,"Can from Chubby Muffin, at Burlington Airport.
This was poured into a stemmed pilsener. Next time from the can for John Kimmich.
The appearance was a hazyburnt yellow to orange (grapefruit looking) color. A two finger white foamy head started off and dissipated within about a minute leaving messy foamy lacing clinging to the glass.
The smell had a big sweet sticky burst of bitter grapefruit rind, extra lemon/orange rind helps to embed a nice edge. Light grassy tones arrange to balance.
The taste was bittersweet sticky citrus weaving into the aftertaste and leaving a wet grapefruit bitter finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation seemed good for the style and for me allowing the bitterness to take effect of the harshness on my tongue. 
Overall, hot damn, everything is in place to be the best AIPA on the market. This one may have eluded me for so long but now I want this all of the time.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3848,"2015-07-20",4.1,"Kolor: Jasnozłoty, piwo jest zmętnione.
Piana: Obfita, drobno i średniopęcherzykowa. Średnio trwała. Pozostawia ładny lacing.
Aromat: Chmielowy, ale raczej ziołowy niż owocowy, łodygowy, trawiasty trochę. Nie aż tak intensywny, jak się spodziewałem.
Smak: Półwytrawne, średnio pełne, alkohol niemal niewyczuwalny (leciutkie grzanie w przełyk). Wysoka goryczka, zbyt długa, zalegająca. Piwo jest mocno chmielowe w smaku, ale również głównie na sposób ziołowy.
Wysycenie: Niskie do średniego. Idealne.
Opakowanie: Srebrna puszka z niewielkim nadrukiem i minimalną ilością informacji (nie ma nawet nazwy browaru). OK.
Uwagi: Niezłe IPA, ale nie powala mnie na glebę. Rzeczywiście wyjątkowa jest ilość chmielowych smaków w piwie, ale już goryczka jest zalegająca, a aromat średnio intensywny. Obawiam się, że całość nie dorasta do legendy jaką to piwo obrosło.

3848,"2015-07-02",3.6,"Hazed marigold hue with ample foam. Aromatic, fruity nose with stinging pineapple notes alongside softer white peach; some green banana, garlic scape, papaya; overall pungent, but not severe. Flavor has a surprising sweetness of a traditional type, with burnt orange rinds, marmalade, and steeped tea notes maybe hinting at a touch of crystal with the pale malt. Because of this, the blueberry, citrus, and stone fruit hop flavors are less dominant than expected, and the general textural clarity of the beer is somewhat lost. So, while flavorful, compact and balanced, this version might be closer to the type of IPA this brewery helped to make obsolete than to the type it helped to popularize.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

3848,"2015-04-12",4.3,"Po przelaniu do szkła (zalecane przez Johna Kimmicha ""picie wprost z puszki"" jakoś mnie nie przekonuje) tworzy się dość spora, choć szybko opadająca, drobno, średnio i w końcu po chwili również grubo pęcherzykowa piana ze średnim lejsingiem. Barwa złoto-żółta, mocno opalizująca, a po dolaniu pojawia się sporo pływających drobinek chmielu. W aromacie naprawdę bardzo pięknie, intensywnie i chmielowo. Czuć tu po prostu świeży chmiel, zielone, pachnące, żywiczne szyszki wprost z krzaczków! Oczywiście owoce cytrusowe i tropikalne połączone z iglakami, bez cienia jakiegoś DMSu czy diacetylu - po prostu czysty, orzeźwiający, bogaty amerykański chmiel. Smak dość wytrawny, słodycz naprawdę nieduża, owocowo-słodowa, nadająca balansu chmielowej nawałnicy atakującej nasze kubki smakowe. Goryczka jest konkretna, ale strasznie przyjemna, krótkotrwała i czysto chmielowa, grejfrutowo-świerkowa - uderza z duża siłą, by po chwili ustąpić i zachęcić do kolejnych łyków. Nagazowanie średnie do niskiego, odczucie w ustach gładkie, smukłe. Alkohol w smaku kompletnie niewyczuwalny, ale wyraźnie rozgrzewa w przełyku. 
Świetne piwo. Idealny przykład stylu American IPA - bardzo pijalna, sesyjna, znika ze szkła zbyt szybko (byłaby zdradliwa przy większej ilości). Największą zaletą tego piwa jest jednak perfekcyjnie świeży i umiejętnie użyty amerykański chmiel - to tu tkwi tajemnica. Jednocześnie oznacza również, że szybko się starzeje, z każdym dniem byłoby tylko mniej intensywne... No i cena - 32zł to jednak zdecydowana przesada, idealnym zamiennikiem jest dla nas choćby Deep Love z AleBrowaru czy American IPA z Kormorana. Różnice są naprawdę nieduże, w zasadzie w niuansach (i to tylko dla beer geeków) i kwestiach marketingowo-prestiżowych - za jednego Focal Banger mielibyśmy 4 polskie świetne piwa! Inną sprawą jest jednak być wśród nielicznej grupy wybrańców, którym dane było spróbować tego ""cudeńka"", zwłaszcza w odległym kraju nad Wisłą...","Kalisz, POLAND","alteregoo"

Has a glowing, hazy apricot orange color, with a decent, stable head.

Aromas are defined by a dank fruitiness of both, pineapples and lemon. Also bread, as well as papaya shine through less intense, together with honeyed malt qualities.

Begins well balanced, with resinous lemon among a distinct biscuity maltiness. Then a crisp, almost sharp, bitter lime hoppiness emerges on the palate, supported by grassy herbs. This brew has a very pronounced maltiness which blends flawlessly into the the hops, beginning with honeyed, biscuity notes, turning into a bready, earthy direction. Helps to bring out the hops, which start grassy and a bit resinous, heading into a more and more fruity direction, with a slick lime and orange ending.

-A fveil of foam covers the hazy pale blond.
-The fluffy mouthfeel is as natural as can be.
-The aroma and hop flavor are both superb.
-Marijuana is also evoked by the hop profile.

3848,"2014-04-27",4.0,"Can, thanks to blckout20! Appearance: Nice pale golden pour with thin white head. Aroma is very fruity (mango, banana, oranges), some light dank hops and some biscuit malts / graham crackers. Taste is fruity, moderate to high bitterness and a tad too sweet. Carbonation is rather low. Im being picky here as Im comparing it to HT. Not nearly as powerful and resinous as Heady, but a very good highly drinkable IPA.","Quebec, CANADA","Luk_"
3848,"2014-04-21",4.4,"Can. Pours murky orange with thin white head that lingers. Medium hop aroma over light carbonation. Some citrus flavor with pepper finish. Signature alchemist complexity in a superior ipa.

Aroma is packed with dank hops. Citrus and pine mostly with a hint of tropical fruit. Taste is so oily and dank without being perfumy. Reminds me a lot of Heady. Grapefruit, mango, pine, pineapple, and fresh cut grass. Moderate bitterness and so smooth. Just awesome. Why are all the best IPAs and DIPAs from Vermont? I hope I can retire there.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
3848,"2014-03-31",3.3,"Pours an orange hue with tons of sediment suspended in the liquid. Delicate white foam forms on the surface, leaving behind sticky cobwebs of lace. 

Soft, low carb level. Citric aroma is a bit faint, reminding me of what this moderately old (~1 month?) IPA likely once was. Clean malts beg me not to notice the aging hops behind them but alas, it's too late. Hints of tropical fruits fade quickly with each sip, dressing my palate in past-prime hoppy bitterness. Still a decent beer today, yet I can only imagine what this tasted like a few weeks ago. 

Regardless, it's no Heady.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"
3848,"2014-03-31",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2014 Can: Thanks, Mark! Cloudy orange-amber body with tiny bits of sediment floating about, topped with a wimpy, eggshell colored film & collar. Aroma is intense hoppage; dank hemp oil & weedy hops, fresh cut wet grass, tangerine zest, grapefruit flesh, very juicy & citric moreover with plenty of raw hop earthiness grinding through it all. Taste is crisp & delicious... A mouth full of wet pine, dankness, dripping lupulin oils, weed, grass, bitter grapefruit pith, light green onion, orange & tangerine peel, & the slightest kiss of sugar cookie malt sweetness in the finish. Aftertaste still leaves a lingering bitterness on the tongue. Truly delicious!","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
3848,"2014-03-29",4.2,"The aroma consists of moderate-heavy citrus, pineapple, and grapefruit. It pours a hazy dull orange with a lot of sediment. It had a small white head that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a slightly thicker ring. The flavor starts with moderate citrus, pineapple, and tropical fruits.

The last of the pour definitely has Heady Topper lite levels of crap in it. How is this not a detriment to this and Heady Topper to more people? Aroma is peach, hay, orange and a slightly past its prime malt. Taste doesnt have any of that heavy malt. Nice tropical start with more orange in there and some stone fruit. Then it dies off and leaves a average to ho hum IPA. Overall, I am happy to have tried another beer from Alchemist and realize it isnt worth trading for.","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"

Nose is peach, orange, mango, dough, heavy yeast, orange blossom, really good, pineapple. Almost IPA and saison blend. Taste is grapefruit rind, not too bitter, orange juice, bread, sourdough bread, almost IPA and saison blended in a way. Long finish, well balanced. Not too aggressive hoppy. Definitely more of an East Coast IPA. Palate is a 5, really great palate that I dig. Overall 3.9. Thanks boys!","Oceanside, California, USA","biggirlpanties"

[ Can ][ dfroms ][ 16oz ][ Trade ][ Reidel Vinum XL Pinot Noir ][ 3/15/14 ]
>> Thank you dfroms for the major hookup! Cloudy deep orange pour with medium to lower foam. Small formation, small lacing. Nose up front is explosive with pineapple upside down cake and coconut rum. Taste is a tad papery, some sugar, and some hefty bitterness that lingers like eating a Brazil nut or walnut. Not what I would call bright or juicy. Somewhat spicy with mild butterscotch. A bit dusty in finish. Nice, but Alchemist has got to be the most overhyped brewery out there right now.

3848,"2014-03-13",3.9,"Can with sticker label :) Mosaic & Citra - I like where this is headed. The pour is murky medium golden with some debris present as mentioned. I suppose you dont see that very often. Anyway - the head is whispy, two fingers, retention is average , with some light lacing present. The nose is dank, juicy fruit, tropicals, caramel, sourdough, meshing with some floral notes. Its very nice. The flavor profile is bittering initial, while it slowly moves to more distinct elements from the tropical side, like pineapple and grapefruit, while becoming more robust near the finish from caramelly undertones and more sweet bread here. There is a feint grassy, floral side present that gets rounded out by a long finish. For the IPA 7% range, this is fantastic imo.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

Lots of particles floating in the body. Thin off-white head, not much lace. Nothing impressive about the appearance. Awesome, big, citrusy resiny hop aroma, very impressive for 7%. A lot of caramel bready malt too. Hard to believe, really. Tastes like 8-9%. Not sure if this is a good or bad thing. More caramel malt sweetness than your typical IPA. Bigger body.

3848,"2014-02-27",3.6,"Can courtesy of vtafro! Poured half into a Dogfish Head IPA glass and drank half from the can. Pour was a pale gold with a one finger white head that clung to the glass nicely before breaking into soapy lacing. Aromas were of heavy orange/peach with some earth/pine. Very fresh smelling and inviting. Taste was not as luscious as the smell. A nice burst of floral hops but the malt bill seemed thin. The grapefruit bitterness arrives in the finish unchallenged and kind of leaves the back-end of this feeling bare. A good beer but not a great one.

This has just two hops (Mosaic and Citra) compared to HT which has a blend of many hops, i.e. something for everyone.

How: Tap at brewpub
The look: Cloudy blonde body topped by a long-lasting small white head
In long: The strong mega-hoppy nose shows a lot of tropical fruits, lemongrass, grapefruits, front lawn grass.  An pleasant but unusual aroma for Simcoe/Chinook based IPA.  The beer is well malted but the bready honyed malts provide only a solid body are totally dominated by the intense hopping.  VERY intense hopping.  Grapefruits, tropical fruits, hops resin, grass juice.  Sensation of biting on a green hop pellet.  Sticky long-lasting bitterness.  This is a very tasty beer, very bitter, very sharp.  Almost too tasty to be sessionnable.  Yet another kick-ass hoppy beer from The Alchemist.  A strange beer name but theres a story behind it.  The brewer was talking to one of his friend about their friend Al (a real jerk) and his slutty wife.
