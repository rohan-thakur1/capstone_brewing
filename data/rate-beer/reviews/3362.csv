3362,"2016-10-07",4.4,"A 1 pint can canned sometime in 2016 with the all important month date cut off the lip of the bottom of the can. Poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. It poured a hazy golden orange colour with a big three finger white head that had great retention and left lots of nice lacing. Aromas are strong tropical and citrus fruits. Mango, peach, orange, orange pith and a touch of lemon. Tastes of tropical pineapple juice with light peach and mango at the beginning, is then followed by lightly bitter citrusy orange pith and lemon zest. Crisp, dry, light bodied with moderate to high carbonation. Overall a great Session IPA. Extremely drinkable especially on a hot summers day. Full of tropical and citrus fruit. Could very well be my go to Session IPA.","Hong Kong, HONG KONG","davidezdonz"
3362,"2016-10-04",3.7,"Nice mango citrus tropical hop aroma with a slight piney finish. Taste is the same with a good amount of malt balance for a session IPA. Easy drinking but flavorful. Maybe a light yeasty dank pine to the finish but otherwise a nice tropical hop session IPA.

3362,"2016-09-05",3.7,"Aroma is as you expect it to be, citrus with lighter malt notes - even if it smells a little bit maltier than I expected. Taste is at first light bodied, not too far from another Pipeworks brew we all love, but soon it develops a slight herbal touch with flowers and citrus dominating over it to the end. A distinct and firm bitterness. Sometimes session-IPAs doesnt really deliver all the way, but this one does. Great session beer.","Örebro, SWEDEN","Hopmaestro"

3362,"2016-07-17",3.7,"16 Oz can from Printers Row Wine Shop (Chicago, IL). Nice find before some rooftop drinking. Pours a nice decent hazed golden amber hue. A touch of orange fire glow when it strikes the right light, frothy whitish head is sizable but dies down quickly to a thicker ringer and laces ok. Aromas are telltale fruity Citra, tropical and citric melange, a bit of grass, bitter floral appeal and jabs of pineapple. Initial shows a lighter body, good bitterness. Florals, soap, fruity hop melange with a jab of slightly toasty malt substance sitting well into the middle not unlike a Daisy Cutter style appeal. Fruity Citra fills in the gaps around the base with a firm bitter appeal without overwhelming. The flavors support a more sessiony base here, allowing a good drinking pace without just being bitter hop water. A decent flavor edge, the hops strike a nice balance with that toasty malt appeal. A fun sessioner that doesnt just smack of trendy hops. Nice nose, solid pour, good flavor and nice flow that seems to be its strength.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
