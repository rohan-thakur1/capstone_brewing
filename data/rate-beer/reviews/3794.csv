3794,"2016-07-18",4.7,"bottle shared at our tasting. split 4-ways. poured a bright red to pink colour with a light pink coloured head on top. the nose explodes in a split second with sweet raspberry tartness, just tons of fruited raspberries, still so fresh, this is on a complete different level compared to the abricot version, so much cleaner, and not as tart sour as side project brews can get. still lots of clean funk on the back of the nose, tart apples, some citrus, clean oak, not getting to vinous, sweet raspberry yoghurt, light grains, and funky yeast. the flavor has even more sweet raspberries upfront, incredible balance of sweet and sour notes. slight horseblanket funk. an aboslute incredible side project brew, and maybe the best one cory has ever made. this is so balanced without getting to sour.","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"

3794,"2015-09-07",3.9,"750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Deep pink/purple body. Hazy. Small white head. Raspberry and white wine. Almost all raspberry. Some yeast that reminds you its a saison. Sharp sourness. Sour raspberry. Some raspberry sweetness. A little bit musty. White wine finish. Medium light. A bit too sour for me. The raspberry flavor is good, but it dominates everything. Missing some of the quality of the base beer.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

3794,"2015-08-23",4.7,"This beer is absolute perfection. Pours a beautiful ruby red color with a light pink head. Aroma is massive raspberries, tart, dry, funk. Flavor is potently sour, like a raspberry warhead, coating the pallet with sour oily goodness. Wow. Thanks JP for sharing!","Norfolk, Virginia, USA","Dr_Fellini"
3794,"2015-08-10",4.0,"Draft at Hill Farmstead with a bunch of heads. Pours a vibrant pinkish red shade with medium to large white head. Aroma is the standout here with ultra sour raspberry, bright French oak, and super tart yeasts. Flavor wasnt as impressive for me. A little thin and a touch too acidic with notes of raspberry puree, red wine, and cranberry. Very nice but I much preferred the regular fermier at this FOFA.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
3794,"2015-08-09",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 10, 2015 Bottle poured at FOFA15 with Linh, Paul, Vin and Alan. Pours a beautiful glowing pink body with rich haze and white lacing. Aroma is super in your face - raspberries all the way - pretty incredible. Mouthfeel is very acidic with notes of super sour fruits - cranberries, raspberries and some strawberries with lots of tart acid, raspberry candies and pure sour oak character. Unrelenting sourness. Great, hard to believe the regular saison version untreated with raspberries was better.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"

3794,"2015-07-13",4.4,"yup, Bottle thanks to Dustin, this is the shit, tons of raspberry flavors, without the sweetness, or tartness really. the tart/sweet comes from teh base beer which is subtle lactic, very light brett, and white light grains (Wheat). Awesome beer right here.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
