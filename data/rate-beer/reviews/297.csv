297,"2016-02-27",3.7,"Pour from growler into 10 oz. pub glass. Appears dark-honey-golden with a small white head that quickly breaks into spotty lacing. Medium carbonation makes this beer look thick. Aromas are of fresh cut grass, light spruce, light cannabis, hint of onion, earth and some floral notes. Actually pretty light aroma for the profile. Taste is an earthy medley of the aforementioned aromas. Hints of citrus, light honey sweetness and notes of alcohol add to the depth. Fairly well masked warmth, but still present...I could sense the gravity of this one. Finishes with a moderate earthy bitterness coupled with some lingering alcohol warmth. Bit of a sticky/resinous mouthfeel. Certainly a fine offering but a bit too big for my palate. Fun to try, but give me Abner any day!","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"
297,"2016-02-26",4.5,"Growler from HF.
Tagged best consumed by March 01, 2016.
This was poured into a snifter.
The appearance was a semi-hazy almost burnt orange color with a thin wisp of a white head that quickly dissipated. Light bubbles of broken head float around the top. Light wispy lacing.
The smell takes in sweet danky onion sliding on into through resinous pine and then a light grapefruit underneath.
The taste had a full bittersweet flavor revolving around the resinous piney part. Dry resinous aftertaste leads into a dry finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body. ABV, whoah, where did that go? Its not really there, well hidden.
Overall, wow, just wow, just an absolutely stellar job by HF. Id love to have this again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
297,"2016-02-26",4.4,"Growler, 4 days old, shared at Stoneface. Exceptional stuff. The dominant flavors and aromas are ""classic"" American piney hops and just enough malt sweetness to remind you that youre dealing with a 10.3%ABV beer. It was so light and crisp, though, that it almost reminded me of a hoppy pale ale. The hops, the malt, the booze, everything is all so balanced in this beer. Fantastic.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
297,"2016-02-25",3.8,"750ml growler trade with Hop Resident and bought today @Hill Farmstead. Thanks man! Aroma: I bet there are some New Zealand hops in there. White wine, resinous, that typical Hill Farmstead water smell. Kinda woody. Weird I know, but still I find it woody. Not much fruits. Some biscuit malt as well. App: cloudy golden, small white head and big bubbles on the sides and as usual for HF great lacing. Taste and palate: medium body, oily and resinous, soft texture, medium long bitter finish. This is also dry. Overall: funny because lately Ive been drinking lots of Trillium and Tree House. To me Trillium and Tree House are slightly better when comparing IPAs and Pale Ales than HF. But, Saison... Omg, Trillium is so far behind! Anyway, for this Imperial Pale Ale, I thought it was good. Was it as good as what I tasted lately? No. But its still good.","St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Stoned99"

Le fruit nest pas plus présent que lépinette et réciproquement. Lalcool occupe cependant une place importante. En bouche le même manège se poursuit avec cette salade de fruits pour adulte où le fruit a macéré dans du Triple Sec. Le conifère murmure en canon une douce mélopée aux notes botaniques.

297,"2015-11-11",4.9,"750 mL growler. Originally reviewed 10/8/2011.

Hazy golden orange body with a slightly dark tint to it. Not a huge head, but whats there is a sticky and lacey and all that is wondeful.

Smell - Gobs of citrus hops. The sweetness is there, but even at 10.5% it doesnt dominate in the aroma.

The sweetness does come through in the taste, but its secondary to the hops and it even incorporates itself pretty well. Once the waves of citrus hops die down, the sweetness comes about in mango and pineapple flavors. Its as if the malt is an appendage of the hops. It finishes ever-so-slightly bitter.

Low carbonation. I wonder if thats a growler thing or if thats just how it is. The body comes off a bit heavy from the lack of carbonation, but the flavors bring you back for more and more.

I have increased my rating of this beer every time Ive had it.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

297,"2014-05-08",4.4,"Growler: Thanks, Oliver! Beaming orange-amber hybrid, just a slight haze running throughout but appears clear from afar, topped with a foamy & frothy, gray-tinted head; moderate webbing left behind. Aroma is an American hop dream... Huge tropical & citric presence; juicy mango, sweet peach, pineapple, orange, guava, all with a lovely undercurrent of herbal pine, evergreen, & freshly cut grass. Pleasant sweetness on the nose, giving a gushing, juicy quality to the hops. Ephraim is even juicier on the palate... Bomb of sweet peach, orange peel, mango, just an explosion of tropical, fruity hops. Lightly bitter, gracefully sweet, like biting into a fruit & taking part of the rind with it. Pine needles & herbal hemp oil cut through & round things out, light resinous & dank quality near the finish. Notes of lightly toasted pale malt & honeycomb coat the palate in the aftertaste, lingering with a combo of candied grapefruit flesh & sugar cookies. Substantial, big body, but not overly viscous or cumbersome for the style. I am not normally a fan of ""sweeter"" DIPAs, I dont like the overly sticky, caramel malts getting in the way. Ephraim is definitely sweet, but its the addition of dextrose while still keeping an all pale malt bill that makes the delicate sweetness work to accentuate the hops rather than crowd them with an abundance of toffee-like sweetness that comes with darker malt bills (Abrasive takes a similar approach, also a favorite of mine). Ephraim is a fantastic ""big"" DIPA, done properly.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

Pours a hazy light apricot with a sheet of light white foam. Smell is juicy. Some pear, some tangerine, some melons and pineappel, and hints of resin, but mostly sweet juicy hops. This is an approach to hops and grain Ive not really experienced before, this is really innovative - this does not really smell like an IPA/IIPA. More like a sweet biscuit with some preserves on it. Flavor follows suit, really unassuming for the style. Not overly syrupy sweet, like some IIPAs, but slightly sweet with lots more juicy fruit, biscuity malt and now some bitterness and a little more hop character as it warms. Full bodied with sharp carb and a semi dry finish. This is a really fine brew, Im not sure I would go nuts for it, and would likely prefer a few cans of Heady Topper over this, or several others as well. i might argue the beer is a little too heavy on the Dextrose, like Hop Henge in the last couple years.","Spokane, Washington, USA","harrymel"

Ephraim pours a relatively clear bright yellow gold in color with a one finger, soapy white head. The nose is very fresh and aromatic with plenty of tangerine and pineapple. Right off the bat it reminds me of Dreadnaught with just a touch more malty sweetness. The flavors are very bright and clean tangerine, pineapple, and grassy hop character with a moderate level of pale malt sweetness and a touch of alcohol. The best part of all of this is how well rounded the flavors are. It drinks pretty light in body and for the style isnt bitter at all, increasing drinkability.

A: Pours a chilled hazy amber color, but clears up once it warms up, with a one finger fluffed white head that leaves some splotchy lace down the glass.

S: Smells of sweet fruits, grapefruits, apples, some pine and a little booze all fill those nose. Such extreme variations in hops is really an explosion to the nose. You can also pick up some malts somehow.

T: The taste is just exploding as the nose. Buttery and fruity with a nice sugary sweetness. The main fruit Im picking out is a sweet apple for some reason. Little resin/pine quality with a full malt body. Finish is a slightly bitter.

M: Medium to light bodied with a nice bubbly carbonation and a very refreshing quality. The drinkability is ridiculous. I could drink this all day, every day.

O: This is my first Hill Farmstead beer and it was great. There was a lot going on with all the hop variations, but it worked out nicely and the drinkability was insane. If only Vermont wasnt an 18 hour drive.

Flavour is absolutely orgasmic, bursting of pungent tropical fruits as mentioned, truckloads of pungent citrusy hops, a bit of floral presence (as with most Hill Farmstead), and just enough malt presence to back without influencing the taste. Ridiculous amount of depth and flavour to this, characterized by the pungent tropical fruits and citrus hops, with no astringency at all.

It is punchy and bright, juicy and perhaps just a touch sweet, with very little bitterness to disrupt the raw hop power on display. The hop is lemony, orange, skunky and earthy, if not somewhat fecal, but more the ""forest floor"" the wine critics love using as opposed to, say...  Well, you know. Hill himself has already set the bar so impossibly high that, even with this being so many words ahead of pretty much every ipa ever made, one almost still feels let down that there isnt just...  more. More power. More oomph. Because this is not Edward, a supposed pale ale, that asks to be taken lightly. This is the big daddy, and compared to Double Sunshine, or his Double Galaxy, or the rare Younger keg, this feels the softest, and most wanting for just a little more juice.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

297,"2012-09-28",4.1,"750mL Growler, purchased at the brewery today. Uber-fruity resin aroma, leaning in that fresh, raw sticky ganja direction, definitely with strong Simcoe and friends qualities. Flavors get a little more wild and funky. A bit of faint onion pairs up with a nip of cat and some chewy green plant juice. I cant get into this one like I can get into Abner and the early Society & Solitudes. The hop flavors really huddle around Simcoe and find themselves releasing some almost stink-gland like plant chemicals. Its certainly hop flavor turned up to an eleven, but it might be too loud? I think the hop work is certainly excellent, it might just be more of a matter of taste in terms of the varieties used and the intensity of the flavors from those varities (i.e. Simcoe and Chinook).

A - What little head that is here took until after my pour to appear. Solid white and then fades fast. This is a very complex and gorgeous beer. Bright orange on the edges and darker more golden orange at the center. Extremely cloudy and clearly zero-filtering happened on this one. 

S - The Centennial and Simcoe are easy to pick out. The others, not so much. The piney resinous scent I expected from a (theoretically) 280IBU beer is not there. Pine and Grapefruit juice are present followed by lemon juice and orange with a hint of pepper.

T - Okay, now there is that bitterness I expected. Wow. Well, a lot or citrus (tang from grapefruit and sweet from tangerine). This is followed by some pine cone taste and a very manly malt-backbone. The bitterness is on the border of domination but never reaches that point of being too intense. 

M - medium carbonation, heavy body. Almost grape skin sort of dry finish. 

O - It tastes like what a working farmer would enjoy after a long day. Its not my favorite HFS beer by a long shot but still was a pleasure to drink.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

The beer appears clear and golden hued. The head is thick, has last retention, and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass.

The aroma is a bouquet of fresh hops and citrus, with a very slight hint of alcohol.

The flavor is bold and fantastic, with the expected hop and citrus coming through beautifully. A truck load of bitterness and fresh hops assault the palate in the best possible way. Alcohol presence gently reveals itself near the finish, but I wouldnt have guessed this was 10.5% abv. Wow, this is incredibly drinkable at that potency. This brew is certainly worthy of attention and praise. I thoroughly enjoyed Ephraim and would relish the opportunity to have it again.

297,"2012-05-12",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2012 Review transfered from BA.  Was a week old Oct 11 filled swing top HF growler shared with a few other BAs. Loud pop when opening growler; poured into a tulip.

Pours a clear, golden orange color with a frothy light yellowish tan. Average retention and plentiful streaks and dots of lacing. Body has a pleasant glow and steady stream of small bubbles rising to the surface. 

Aroma is spectacularly fresh, juicy and hoppy. Tropical and citrus fruits, like tangerine, grapefruit, and pineapple dominate with minimal pulp and resin bitterness. 

Flavor is not quite as outstanding as the aroma. Well, let me rephrase, its not as intensely sweet and focused on the tropical (pineapple) notes, instead there is a much more pronounced pine and grapefruit rind flavor that particularly lingers in the finish. Front to middle of the palate is where the sweeter fruit and light malt flavors dominate and produce a juicy, slick mouthfeel. The back of the palate and finish are then bludgeoned by intense hop oils and bitterness. 

Body is medium thick, though slightly thinner than Id prefer, with tight, fine carbonation. Alcohol also provides a slight burn in the finish.

Overall this is an exceptional DIPA. A little more sweetness in the body like the nose, instead of pine and resin would push both the drinkability and taste higher for me.

297,"2011-10-15",4.2,"Served on-tap at Capones earlier today into a 5.5oz taster glass. I got two just to be sure...
A - Pours clear golden orange with a small half finger tall white head leaving small rings of lace down the glass.
S - Smells of lightly toasted caramel malt and lots of hops. Initially it is a bit weak but as it warms up the hops just flood the nose. Citric fruit and a touch of pine resin round things out. If not for the slow start this would have been a five.
T - Starts off with a quick taste of caramel malt that is quickly enveloped by the intense citric hop bite. Hints of tropical fruits; mostly grapefruit, pineapple, and mango; help to balance things out a bit. The finish is pretty dry with lots of hop bitterness, lingering on the pallet for a short period of time. Very well balanced yet still intensely hoppy, great stuff.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Slightly sweet, intensely hoppy, feel throughout the entire glass. A tiny bit more carb would have helped but not a huge deal.
O - Having had most of the other hoppy Hill Farmstead beers I can say that this is my new favorite, but only by a very small margin. The hops are strong but not overpowering and it is easy to drink. One of the best for sure.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

The nose on this beer is absolutely fantastic. Just bursting through with a ton of tropical and citrus fruit along with some slight earthy pine, pale malt and sweet booze. Lots of mango and pineapple as well as some grapefruit and lemon peel. One of the best smelling IPAs Ive encountered.

This beer looks great and smells incredible but unfortunately the flavor falls way off. The citrus and tropical fruit notes are there but anywhere near as prominent as the aroma suggests. More bitter and earthy than expected with piny/soily flavor but not overly dry. Also, it is very hot and the strong booze component kills the best of the hop flavor. Hints of grapefruit and lemon peel with a very faint tropical presence. The malt backbone is also stronger than expected with hints of biscuit and an overly grainy graham cracker presence. Toward the end of the palate the beer is almost all booze. Kind of all over the place an very disappointing.

Beer is amber, light amber and mostly clear with a wonderful thick head of small and medium bubbles, head has some retention to it too. Some lacing left on the walls of my HF glass, the lacing probably only works in the right glassware.

Aroma is awesome. It is hoppy, like a fruit salad, with mango and peaches and cantaloupe and papaya. Complex, fruity, hoppy, good.

Beer is medium to light in body and really really bitter. This beer likely maxes out the bitterness scale for beer in general but specifically this beer is quite quite bitter. There is very little hint of malt at the lead off and there is an unfolding on flavors on the midpalate with a variety of fruity esters from the hops. The beer has good connectivity and I thoroughly enjoyed two full pours of this beer. A great great great IPA for sure. I could hurt myself with a growler of this beer.

Had this very fresh at EBF. The characteristics are similar to what is described below, but everything was so much more pungent. The nose absolutely exploded with raw hops that carried through to over-the-top hops in the flavor along with a really nice amount of bitterness for a seriously drinkable brew.

Old Review: 4 / 4.5 / 4 / 4.5 / 4

On tap at the Three Penny Taproom. Super-friendly staff and Im really glad that this was still on we Amyliz4 and I made it in.

Pours a really bright orange color with two fingers of white head and a load of sticky lacing around the edges of the glass. The nose is really nice and over-the-top hoppy with a lot of pine, resin, orange peel, citrus, and some light tropical fruits.

The taste has many of the same components of the nose, though those are often overshadowed by the absolutely bruising bitterness that comes through in the mouthfeel. Citrus, tropical fruits, and a bit of pine. The feel is really, really hoppy and mixes well with the light alcohol that comes through. Id love to try this again and will hopefully be making a trip back up North to visit all these magnificent Vermont breweries at some point soon.

4.0 A: Lightly hazed medium orange color. Two fingers of creamy off-white head. Half the head fell after a short time, but the remainder stuck around for a while. Spotty lacing covers the glass.

4.5 S: Really wonderful aroma! Tons of tropical fruits in this. Pineapple, mango, lots of papaya and orange. Secondarily piney and floral. Fruits combine for a sugary sweetness. Malts are pretty well hidden.

5.0 T: Holy shit is this tasty! I cant believe how wonderful this is. Im pretty sure a pallet of various tropical fruits had been compressed and molden into the shape of a .50 caliber bullet, then overpacked with powder and shot into my tongue. Pineapple, mango, orange, papaya, and peach are incredibly strong. So fruity, but not too sweet. Malt is easily overshadowed by the hops, but it does well enough to keep the taste balanced. For 280 hypothetical IBUs, the bitterness is quite low and only manifests in the aftertaste. Alcohol is extremely well hidden.

4.5 M: Medium to heavier medium body. Good carbonation, especially for a growler. Very creamy (but could be a bit moreso) and incredibly smooth.

5.0 D: I never thought this would live up to the hype, but instead, it has surpassed it. There isnt a damn thing I would change about this beer. Its about as close as you can get to a perfect taste. Absolutely fabulous. Worth whatever you need to trade for it.

Growler provided by sleepydave, drank into my Narke tulip...The top pops without an whiff and Im a bit concerned, then I see theres only about a half centimeter of air, so Im good. Pours a dark peach, nice color. At first it pours without any head, then as it settles about a full finger of light tope head. Pretty good retention, but really nice lacing; thin drops around the glass but super sticky...The aroma is not at as strong as expected, but in a good way; doesnt overpower. Very light grapefruit on the front, light sugar, and sweet pine hops. The backbone is light pine and alcohol but exactly what you are looking, makes me really want to drink it...The taste is a super nice perfect combination of sweet and bitter. The sweetness doesnt really show as fruits, but sugar and alcohol. The finish is hoppy, gives you want you want but not at all harsh or so much hops it distracts you from drinking. The finish is pine resin, sugar, alcohol and a little metal....The feel is outstanding. Sticks to your palate start to finish, its full, coating, makes you lick your lips, a smooth and lasting finish...Incredibly drinkable.

Another beer that was crazily hyped but actually lived up to expectations. Would LOVE to try this fresh.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
297,"2011-03-25",4.4,"Poured a clear golden amber with a small lingering amber head. Aromas of biscuit, peach, tropical fruit, tangerine, pink grapefruit and a hint of pine. Palate was medium bodied and crisp with a smooth dry finish. Flavors of biscuit, peach, tropical fruit, tangerine and light pine with a smooth dry moderatly bitter lingering fruity finish.","Arvada, Colorado, USA","Ratman197"
297,"2011-03-22",4.1,"Thanks goes to tyler for sharing this growler.  Pour is a golden, shining orange with a small white head.  Color is clear with tiny bubbles rising to the surface.  Possible the best looking DIPA Ive seen.  Big fruity aroma with pineapple, grapefruit, citrus, and tropical fruit.  Taste is full of tropical fruit, with pineapple, and a hint of bitterness.  Amazingly well balanced for such a large DIPA that keeps its bitterness in check.  No presence of alcohol.  Pretty full bodied.  One of the best DIPAs Ive had.  Thanks once again Tyler!","Minnesota, USA","mattyb83"
297,"2011-03-21",4.3,"Big thanks to Tyler for this treat.  Nice slightly hazy orange pour, with nice lasting but oily white head. Aroma is chewy hops, with big resinous, pine, grassy, slight tropical fruit with mango, and some slight caramel.  Taste is sweet mango, oily pine, grass, resin, and a nice bitter finish balanced by  some caramel notes.  The best DIPA that is not overly bitter by far, they managed to pack hop notes without the palate wrecking bitter.  Excellent!","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
297,"2011-03-21",4.2,"Super short rating. Growler. Shit this is awesome! Pours a glowing, vibrant gold with a resilient, sticky bright white head. Aroma is chock full of juicy hop oils. Slightly leafy and green, but never crosses  the line into astringent. Musty, resinous and dank. Pine sap, tropical fruit meat. Like the other HF IPAs, this beer is a textbook example of how a beer can be insanely hoppy, but never cross the line into astringent and offputting bitterness. He hops are floral, resinous, tropical, dank. Never, ever showing a sign of the 10+% at all. Medium to full bodied. Slightly oily, but never greasy leading to a lengthy, bitter, resinous finish. Holy god this shit is amazing! Thanks a ton Dany!","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
297,"2011-03-21",4.2,"Draft.  Pours a golden orange body with a white head with mild head retention.  Aromatically hoppy fresh grass tones, peach and citrus notes.  A mild grapefruit bite.  Hints of honey and orange.  Delicious HF just put the East coast back on the map for quality IPAs.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
297,"2011-03-14",4.0,"Sample from fresh out-of-the-brewery growler. This one is intense! A real hop aroma bomb, full of fruity-citrusy-flowery notes. The smell is incredible! The taste is on the same range, but its all about hops and its hard to find malt notes in this hop fruit salad. Still an exceptionnal double IPA.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","AGB"
297,"2011-03-14",4.3,"Growler at our Stoutfest Pre-shindig shared by Kan. Thanks! Pours a sunset golden orange with a great amber glow, a decent frothy offwhite head dies to a bubbly foam, ok lacing overall. Aromas knock you back, a blast of hops, citrusy grapefruit and tropical mango mix with lemons, peach, florals, grass, and weeds. Some grainy and bready maltiness, pale with touches of toast and slightly sweeter caramel. More lemon fruit and rind, with some life. Initial is medium bodied, the lighter end, light and airy on the palate with strong hops, bitter and dry with big fruit, mango, grapefruit, and lemons. Bready malts, toast, and pale malts. The sweetness falls back, giving solid fruity hops, a fairly complex profile of melon, mango, tropical with grapefruit, lemons, grass and florals. A touch of sweet bubblegum towards the back with a very dry finish. Touches of fruity elements, dry, hoppy. Very nice, complex, and goes down remarkably easy for a bigger beer like this. Dry, with just a touch of maltiness making it a little more substantial on the palate (Though, Im sure the malt bill is much heavier than youd imagine with the boatload of hops). Kudos to Hill Farmstead for the next big IT in DIPAs.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
297,"2011-03-07",4.1,"A: The pour is surprisingly clear, and is a nice golden amber color with a couple fingers of white head and sticky lacing all down the glass.

S: Intensely fruity on the nose. Excellent grapefruit, but perhaps even better tropical fruit aromas. Lots of pineapple and mango, perhaps some grass and certainly a little bit of pine. A mild sugar aroma provides some additional sweetness.

T: There is a touch of sweet malt flavor, but after that, its just a ton of fruity hops. Pineapple, mango, and peaches give the beer a really nice flavor and the grapefruit and pine notes provide the requisite bitterness.

M: Medium in body with a moderate level of carbonation. Not super bitter on the finish.

D: Damn good stuff, but the alcohol does catch up with you on this one. Deceptively easy to drink.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
297,"2011-03-06",4.2,"Growler pours a transparent, bright orange with some spitty white head.  Great color, OK head retention.  Nose is dank hops, resinous, peachy, candied orange, oily American hops, grapefruit zest, vinous fruit, honey, flower pollen.  Flavor is strong pine, sweet, honey, grapefruit, orange zest, lemons, some corn sugar, a touch peppery, nectarine.  Full bodied,  touch hot with some bracing bitterness.  Very nice.  Could probably use a touch less bitterness and a little more sweetness to round things out.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
297,"2011-03-04",4.0,"Finished a personal project tonight, so thought I would reward myself with a couple of glasses of Ephraim. From a growler sent by a generous Vermonter. Opened on 03.03.2011.

Pours a glowing orange peel orange with a full, thick-lacing-leaving head. A patch of thick bubbles sits idly on a quarter of the surface area.

Tropical fruit hits the nose, emanating bright orange and citrus, peach, mango and papaya. Theres some resinous pine on the end of the nose, but it fades quickly into the light caramel malt backbone. As it opens, I get more caramelized sugar sweetness running through this. 

Surprisingly (why am I surprised) bitter. It opens with the featured tropical fruitiness, but quickly transforms into a punch of pine and grapefruit pith. You can almost feel it tingle on your tongue. I get a nice dose of citric sweetness mid-palate that is washed away by the pithy and resinous bitterness. Sharply bitter finish. 

Medium-bodied, somewhat dry mid-to-late palate. Sticky. Medium to medium-low carbonation. Theres some heat on it.

This tests my personal limits for bitterness, as Ive never experienced anything quite like the finish here - its assaulting. Still, surprisingly complex - the hints of orange that peek through are bright and brilliant - and my first glass is empty before the review is done. A DIPA to be reckoned with.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"
297,"2011-02-28",4.2,"From tap at the brewery. Pours almost clear golden orange with a small white head. Aroma is grapefruity and slight peachy smooth hoppy. Dry. Smooth and lingering fruity hoppy with a touch of alcohol. Ultra clean and bitter fruity finish.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
297,"2011-02-15",3.9,"Deep golden pour.  The nose is very bright and tropical.  Lots of soft tropical fruit.  Chewy and fruity with a lot of soft dank hoppiness.  Very citrusy and fruity - sweetish but the malts are well-balanced by the hops.  Its crazy how drinkable this stuff is - dangerously drinkable.  Fruity grapefruit/mango and pineapple.

297,"2010-12-13",4.7,"In short: A truly fantastic 10% IIPA bursting with tropical fruits that drinks like a 6% session IPA.  Just Wow!
How: Tap at the brewery
The look: Cloudy golden-orange body topped by a medium off-white head with good retention.
In long: The nose is an explosion of tangerines, pineapples, mangos and other tropical fruits.  Body is packed with fresh slightly toasted cereals with some honey and a tiny bit of caramel.  Just enough sweetness to provide some kind of balance while not getting in the way of the hops.  Fresh fruity hops and more fresh fruity hops.  Beers on tap at a brewery/brewpub are always fresh but some just taste fresher than others.  With its bright tropical fruits hops Ephraim is vibrant with freshness.  The bitterness of medium-high intensity does not feel intense at all because of its refreshing character.  I went for more than one glass and I was drinking it like a 5% session IPA.  No alcohol presence at all.  Very few beer above 10% can be described as refreshing, but this one is uber-refreshing.  As of summer 2010, I declare that this beer is the best east-coast IPA ever brewed and I declare Osama Bin Laden the Hide And Seek world champion.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Thick chewy hops interplay with cookie dough pale malts. Medium bodied. Carbonation spot (esp for a growler Ive been sitting on for a few weeks).

A touch of alcohol hides gracefully behind the huge citrus and thick pine notes on the nose.  Lightly sweet, sticky citrus and hop flavors.  Big hop candies, ridiculously sticky resinous character.  Big candied grapefruit and loads of slow lingering quinine on the finish.  Awesome stuff.  First beer in quite a while that Ive ordered a second of at a bar.

I can smell the hop aroma as I pour this out into the glass. Very aromatic with nice tropical type hop notes like pineapple and mango, also some citrus rind. Medium mouthfeel. Fruity malty sweetness gives way to a nice bitter hop bite. Wow, bitter bite, might be a tad much. Very slight alcohol notes but otherwise the alcohol is fairly well hidden.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"

The flavor is very nice and hop-forward.  Sweet and caramel malt base, with huge grapefruity, orangey, pine, herbal notes, and big resin.

On tap and in growlers.

It pours  a hazy yellow with a medium creamy head that holds nicely and laces in the glass. Big hop aroma with notes of citrus and pine. The taste is slightly resinous, citrusy and fruity, but smooth and no alcohol hotness at all. It finishes with a balanced bitterness and slight dryness that begs for a repour.

A - Pours a clear orangish/yellow, white head that dissipates to a thin film, very sticky lacing all along the sides of the glass, and a thin ring around the glass. 

S - Sweet burnt sugars, lots of malts, bitter citrus notes, dankness. Pretty damn solid combo of stuff going on here. 

T - Sweet malts and sugars up front followed by an onslaught of bitter hoppy dankness. Its a transition from one to another, but holy shit, the hops are beating my palate into submission. 

M - Medium bodied, syrupy feel, smooth, light carbonation.

297,"2010-10-11",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2012 My Bottom Line:
Honey-laced tropical fruit burst from this luxurious strong ales aroma and flavor profile, developing sagacious resinous bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A misty orange golden is capped by creamy foam.
-Alcohol is not prominent, which I appreciate.
-This is not just another hop bomb of a Double IPA. It is complex and well polished, and almost tastes 3/4 Double IPA, 1/4 Blond Barley Wine.
-Dare I say this is balanced?

297,"2010-10-07",4.5,"Draft from the Hillstead Farm release 10/2 and from a growler @ home.  Minimally hazy medium orange with a one finger creamy off-white head that lasted the duration on tap, but didnt last near as long from the swing top growler.  Big fruity hoppy nose that consists of tangerines, tropical fruit, and some delicious leafy dry hopped notes, with some light cotton candy caramel sweetness.  Aroma reminds me a lot of Pliny the Younger.  Flavor is more bitter than PtY.  Flavor has a tinge of pine, but otherwise full of the fruits and tons of dry hopped notes that lingers to the finish, which was dry.  The light sweet cotton candy caramel malt blends exceptionally well with the hops.  Bitterness peaked at a 7-8 with some mild alcohol noted, warming in the belly.  Burps pine.  Full body with light to medium carbonation.  This was friggin tasty, and glad I got to try it (gf included).  Thanks for not using Cascades!","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
