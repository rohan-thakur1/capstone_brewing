2678,"2017-06-05",4.5,"500 ml bottle into tulip glass; 2016 vintage bottling, listed at 13.5%. Pours slightly hazy deep reddish orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carnation. Aromas of huge caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, coconut, spicy rye whiskey, toasted oak, and brown bread; with lighter notes of molasses, raisin, cherry, grapefruit, orange peel, pine, cocoa, chocolate, floral, grass, and oak/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malt, rye whiskey barrel, and light-moderate citrus/pine hop notes; with great strength. Taste of huge caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, coconut, spicy rye whiskey, toasted oak, and brown bread; with lighter notes of molasses, raisin, cherry, grapefruit, orange peel, pine, cocoa, chocolate, floral, grass, and oak/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate pine/citrus peel bitterness and whiskey/oak spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, coconut, spicy rye whiskey, toasted oak, brown bread, grapefruit, orange peel, pine, light cocoa/chocolate, floral, grass, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malt, rye whiskey barrel, and light-moderate citrus/pine hop flavors; with an awesome malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and zero astringent flavors after the finish. Light dryness from lingering bitterness and whiskey/oak spiciness, lightly increasing through the glass. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky, fairly sticky/tannic/resinous, and slightly chalky balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Alcohol is extremely well hidden; a very mild warmth with zero barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an insane barrel aged American strong ale! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malt, rye whiskey barrel, and light-moderate citrus/pine hop flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV. Absolutely perfect balance of rye barrels. Amazing levels of added complexity to an already awesome base beer. A highly amazing offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

2678,"2017-01-29",4.0,"2015 bottle. Age turns this beast into a gentle yet massive malt bomb, overflowing with sticky caramel decadence on top of a spicy, oak-laden rye back. Starts sweet, stays sweet, yet finishes with an easygoing booziness belying the huge ABV.

There is an interesting spiciness. Very sweet initially quite malty. This is a lie - it becomes very dry later and rather powerfully bitter. Heavy, oily mouthfeel. Lingering heat in the throat.

Taste is more mellow than the aroma but identical, caramel, sugarcane, molasses are heavy, with stone fruit body and hops and booze finish. In the nose you smell none of the rye aging but in the taste you get a ton of vanilla and smooth oak in the booze finish.

2678,"2016-10-26",4.3,"Double Bastard is one of my favorite beers ever, and Templeton Rye is my favorite whiskey. Ive been anxious to try this since I first saw it last year, but in my area the price has been ridiculous. After a certain point, somewhere north of twenty-five bucks for 500 ml, I just refuse to indulge the brewer and distributor. But when I visited the Stone taproom in Richmond recently I had the opportunity to purchase this beer at a much more reasonable price. Its wonderful, and the rye barrel aging is a a huge element of the character, but regular Double Bastard is so good that I dont see me buying this again. Like regular Double Bastard, this beer pours brown with very little head. The aroma is all the stuff from regular Double Bastard... caramel, apples, brown sugar, spice. Thats all in the flavor, plus the boozy blast of Double Bastard is compounded here. Where I really notice the Templeton barrel aging is in the aftertaste. On the aftertaste the distinct, spicy, sweet, oaky, buttery quality of Templeton is a real, undeniable presence. No denying that this is a great beer. It just isnt better than Double Bastard already is.","Virginia, USA","Darwenus"

2678,"2016-08-29",3.7,"Bottle 2015 : Pour is mahogany , with an a one finger beige head into this glass. It retains on the average side of things, with light spotting presence. The nose has a bit of familiarity to it - that heavy dose of dark fruits and tropicals from the double bastard. Theres some alcohol and barrel notes here. The flavor profile is more complicated - Its perhaps over bittered from the pine hops, and a touch boozy. Tropical notes mesh with caramel and burnt sugars. Coconut and macaroons couple with whiskey notes. Im on the fence on this one. Im a fan of the bitter simplicity of double bastard, but this one seems to tread into the slightly annoying category - as far as drinking more than just a bit.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

The taste delivers a big malt sweetened hit of whiskey and vanilla oak notes followed quickly by resiny pine hop bitterness. Into the finish a pleasing earthy tea note is noticed in spite of the roaring whiskey and pine hops. This attains some balance although a bit of a softer barrel character would help.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Quand on connaît cet arrogant enfoiré, on le reconnaît tout de suite! La bière a visiblement subi un houblonnage à cru très intense car une très forte amertume me frappe dès la première gorgée.

3.25 A: Opaque copper plum color. About 1/2 a finger of frothy beige head formed. Retention is poor but appropriate from such a big beer. No lacing left.

4.0 S: What we have here is barrel forward with a base beer that can handle it. Spicy, earthy whisky with leathery notes. Plum, fig, rum raisins fruits. Toffee and caramel maltiness. Melon, vanilla, and oak. Cant really pick up any hop notes as the barrel and malts are pretty aggressive.

3.75 T: Much maltier than the nose suggests. Lots of toffee and caramel. Also plenty of the fruits mentioned above. The barrel also brings the above flavors, but also a tannic astringency that reminds me of drinking whiskey neat. Despite the malts being pretty potent, the barrel makes this come off as drier.

3.75 M: Heavy body. Good moderate carbonation. Sticky with decent creaminess.

3.75 D: Pretty good overall. The barrel could be a bit better integrated, but its still okay.

In this case, I felt that the rye whiskey subtracted more than it added - interesting, but ultimately more of distraction than an addition. But happy to try it.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

2678,"2015-12-18",4.4,"The beer came in a corked and caged 500 ml bomber, which is an usual package for Stone. The body of the beer looked cloudy amber-brown upon pouring, and the head was one finger thick, and khaki colored. The murky looks were not impressive to me, but the smell was fantastic and changed my perception right away. I could sense brown sugar, caramel, vanilla, and oak via the nose. The taste was sweet up front, with a hit of brown sugar and caramel. The beer dried mid palette, as the oak tannin kicked in. There was a hint of rye spice and a return of sweetness in the finish. The body was silky and smooth, and the beer was surprisingly easy to drink despite the sky high ABV. This was a little expensive, but a nice special treat.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

2678,"2015-11-27",3.5,"Pours a dark copper/chestnut brown color with deep mahogany edges and a one finger yellowish-beige head that quickly settles into a thin ring. Decent retention, lasting through half of the pour with some spotty lacing left behind. 

The aroma of this beer is somewhat bland until it sits for a while and really has a chance to open up. After it warms, there is a decent barrel presence with charred oak, spicy rye and subtle spirit. Underneath, there a decent malt presence but the complexity, especially the interesting hop profile, of the base beer is missing in the nose. More virgin oak than rye whiskey presence with only spicy rye and not much whiskey. Also, lacking in depth usually associated with barrel aged beers. Sweet caramel malts with slight leathery character. Some caramel, toffee, tobacco and vinous dark fruit sweetness. Kind of disappointing compared to other beers in this series. 

Thankfully this beer is much more complex and flavorful than the aroma suggests. Theres a really nice rye whiskey barrel presence thats naively integrated into the well balanced flavor profile of the base beer. Again, theres some deeply charred oak but its not as burnt/toothy as I expected. In addition theres a very nice rye whiskey flavor that isnt harsh, boozy or overpowering. Delicate spirit with spicy rye, toasted coconut and a touch of marshmallow. This is countered mid palate by a complex malt bill and dank, earthy hop bitterness that lingers into the finish. Hints of leather and tobacco followed by caramel, hazelnut and dark fruit sweetness. Somewhat vinous with date, raisin, fig and dark berries followed by grassy resins and dry, piney bitterness. Complex, well balanced with an extremely well masked ABV. I never would have guessed it was 12.7%! Overall, this beer smells pretty bland and isnt much to look at but the integration of barrel flavors is really impressive. Another solid entry in this series.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
