3093,"2014-08-16",4.0,"22 oz bottle bought from Lifesource Natural Grocers in Salem OR.
$4.99
Pours a cloudy. Some might say smoky deep amber with a large impressive thick and creamy light tan head.
Aroma of an old wood fired smoker. Beech wood maybe, its a little sweet so maybe a touch of apple wood smoke also. Some touches of toffee like malts balance it somewhat.
Taste is more balanced..it has all the components of a good dunkel up front then some nice lingering smoke in the back and as after taste.
Mouthfeel is very nice..medium body with mediun carbonation..dry smoke after taste.
Good smoked beer.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"
3093,"2014-08-01",3.9,"Pour is dark caramel with notes of ruby red edges. There is a smaller amount of tan head, fairly tight with a thick lace behind. Nose is gently smoked with notes of caramel, light grain, and a hint of honey malt. Taste is a bit stronger on the smoke, a bit of smoked meat, honey malt, and notes of caramel. Shades of vanilla, assertive carbonation, medium bodied.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"
3093,"2014-07-12",3.6,"Bottle purchased at Lowbrau. Bottled on 3/10/14. There is a good sweet caramel nose, which is backed up by a moderate smoked maltiness. Quite quaffable. Transparent ruddy amber body with a small, off-white head present. Starts with smoked malts early on, before some caramel sweetness takes over in the middle. A little metallic. Finishes with more charred smokiness and a little bitterness. Solid.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
3093,"2014-07-01",3.8,"Bottle. Pours hazy ruby amber with a large creamy tan head that dissipates slowly with nice lacing. Aroma is lightly smoky, nutty, malty, caramel. Flavor is light sweet and light bitter, smoke present but not overpowering, nice nutty dark bread malt tones. Medium body, high carbonation, soft mouthfeel. Nice beer.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3093,"2014-06-09",3.9,"Pours a medium brown, a nice rich shade like a polished reddish mahogany. The liquid seems hazy, though its somewhat hard to tell in a mug. Relatively small head, light khaki in color. Fades away pretty quickly. Im guessing that smoked malt has this effect. The aroma has a full, round malt character on a background of meaty smoke. Good caramel. Quite nutty. The smoked malt adds a hammy flavor with a touch of char, and while the flavor wont be missed, it mostly stays in a supporting role. Typically, smoked malt either dominates a beer or gets lost completely, so its nice to find a beer where the smoke is somewhere in between these extremes. The taste follows the aroma. Lots of nutty, toasty malt with a healthy dose of dried out caramel and the added complexity of a layer of smoke. Its tasty stuff. The base Dunkel seems very well made, and the smoked malt throws a chunk of meaty goodness into the mix. Drier than expected. Its not a terribly dry beer, but it also never really sweetens up. Theres a lot of nutty, bready malt character but without the normal accompanying sweetness. Mouthfeel is light and creamy. The beer fills the mouth with flavor rather than sweetness. Drinks bigger than the abv. Finishes with clean, albeit malty and smoky, flavors. Heater Allen is three for three for me, so far.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
3093,"2014-05-31",3.8,"Well apparently the brewery is not the only spot to snag this 22oz bottle, thankfully! Nice dirt malt on the nose, hints of smoke and clove. Dark brown pour. Lighter hints of Earth and dirt, a tiny banana, and a fairly smokey, yet polite about it finish. Good stuff like all their brews.","Earth, Washington, USA","skoisirius"
3093,"2014-05-30",3.8,"22 oz.bottle. It pours a dark copper brown color with a small orange head. The aroma has nice notes of smoke, salted meats and jerky. Maybe dark maltiness in the background. The flavor has more balance of the regular dark malts and rauch malt. Toast up front followed by some salty meat, wood and smoke. The mouthfeel is a bit of a let down, but maybe thats due to the lower gravity than Im used to for smoked beers. Pretty good stuff.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3093,"2014-05-22",3.8,"Bomber. Pours a cloudy brown color with a small white head. I guess is getting some distribution now. A nice malty and smoky nose. The flavor is bready, sweet fruity malts, biscuit, a bit of heavy smoke, coal. Cola. Very nice. Bready as all hell, and very light bitter hops. Smoke lingers. Awesome.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
3093,"2014-05-10",3.8,"Bottle at home. Pour is slightly murky brown with a small tan head and decent lacing. Meat drippings, oak, light char, dark fruits, bread, cherry pit, and toasted crackers in the aroma. Taste is bacon, smoked oak, hay, light maple, earthiness, yeasty, and light fruitiness on the backend. Medium body with medium-to-high carboantion. Pretty nice smoked lager.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
3093,"2014-04-05",4.1,"22 oz bottle pours reddish brown with a tan head. Chestnut molasses aroma with the perfect smokiness. Creamy mouthfeel, grainy malts, with a subtlly smokey finish. Well done Heater Allen.","Portland, Oregon, USA","BEENJAMIN"
3093,"2014-03-27",4.6,"Like drinking a sweet & sour miso soup. The smoke is just right and upfront, so it gets cleaned from the palate by the malt sweetness and the lager yeast flavors. Delectably complex while being quaffable and at 5.2 abv relatively sessionable.","Magalia, USA","Teddlet"
3093,"2014-03-26",3.7,"22oz bottle with a bottle on date of 3/10/14. Darker clean/clear brown with a thin off white head. Sweetness of dark wheat bread with hints of caramel and light smoke. Clean, light and restrained up front...roasted nutty dark wheat bread, moves into subtle smoke notes that are on the sweet and not meaty or acrid side. Finishes on the dry side with some cola notes as well.","Washington, USA","bvc"
3093,"2013-05-04",3.5,"Draft. Deep amber/dark copper body. Fizzy, off-white head. Aroma of smoke and roasted malts. Hints of chocolate, caramel and fruit. The flavor is moderately sweet and lightly bitter. It finishes lightly to moderately sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Dry. Light campfire smoke taste. So no smoked bacon taste from this beer which was nice.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"
3093,"2013-04-25",4.9,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2013 If one should care to, please refer to my review of the base beer, as I will simply focus on my perceived differences here.  This one feels darker, a bit rounder, creamier as it warms, with a slightly fuller mouthfeel.  The cocoa/chocolate milk nuance is a bit richer, and there is a touch more leafy bitterness in the finish.  The smoke is handled deftly, and wafts along smoothly.  There is something very authentic about this beer; not just in terms of traditional brewing standards or anything strictly beer-centric at all.  This hearkens to the quiet satisfaction of appreciating something of deep quality.  The type of enjoyment that stirs other emotions, humble and true.
The days ranging is done, and darkness has set in the deep wilderness.  Camp is made, the fire prepared, and your game is slowly roasting.  
Glowing, feral eyes glide between the trees ... deep, sweet woodsmoke curls into the thick silence beyond ... and the rhythmic drone of your knife on the hone, creates a song with the fitful embers.","Wilderness, WA, USA, ","brewolf"
3093,"2013-04-07",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 30, 2014 Tap @ Belmont Station...  Poured dark brown with a moderate khaki head.  Really nice smoked beer.  Strong smokiness but wasnt overwhelming.  Low yeast presence, some toasted sweetness and roast with a strong campfire presence.  Nice drinking beer if your into smoke things.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
