2107,"2012-06-14",3.3,"Draft at Cigar City during Hunahpu Day 2012. 

Pours a golden yellow straw color with a half finger white head that slowly fades into a lasting ring.  Sporadic streaks of lace left behind.

Sweet pineapple aroma with subtle funky yeast and bread notes. Id like to expand my description of the nose but thats all there is really. 

Medium bodied with slightly tart funk up front followed by sweet pineapple and a strong bready yeast presence.  Not as much pineapple as expected.  Subtle really with a dry finish.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
2107,"2012-03-28",3.0,"Draft CCBs Hunahpus Day 2012 Pours clear and golden with a mid-sized, fizzy, white head. Unfortunately, the aroma consists mostly of dank, musky, peppery hops with only a trace of pineapple. Medium-bodied with lively carbonation. Fortunately, the pineapple really comes to the forefront in the flavor, providing nice fruitiness and tanginess that carries right on over into the finish.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2107,"2012-03-24",3.5,"Tap at the brewery. Pours a light blonde with a thin white head. Light earthy noble hops and pineapple aroma. Taste is light crisp malt with a touch of pineapple fruitiness. Good.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
2107,"2012-03-21",3.8,"Pineapple kolsch on tap at hunah day 2012... Pours a semi-transparent golden hued consistency  
and topped with a creamy white head... Aroma of soft pineapple, pale  
soft grain, toasted coconut. Subtle but solid character... Continuation of the same flavorwise.  just shy of medium bodied with adequate carbonation.  wishing there were more of a pineapple impartation but i could drink this a ton.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
2107,"2012-03-14",4.0,"On draft at Cigar City Huna Day 2012. Pineapples have been my favorite fruit since childhood so getting to try this was great. Only wished there was a bit more pineapple in this one, but overall very good.",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"
2107,"2012-03-13",4.2,"On draft at hunahpu day. Ah this is a winner for sure, pours with great carbonation, a perfect clear yellow with a great white head. The smell of slight yeast but lovely pineapple is all over this one. The first sip gives way to loads of pineapple with hints of hops and a good malt and yeast finish. Man the pineapple push this one over to an excellent brew, I need more of this one please.","Florida, USA","Gnat628"
2107,"2012-03-13",4.2,"On draft for Hunahpu Day 2012.  Pours a slightly hazy yellow with a white head.  Nose is pineapple all over- some nice sweet malt, pineapple, and some mild yeasty notes.  Flavor is similar- just an easy drinking beer.  Lovable and best enjoyed by the gallon.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
2107,"2012-03-12",4.2,"Nice yellowish pour, frothy white head.  Aroma of pineapple and a nice malty note.  Flavor is so wonderful with the sweet pineapple shining.  Not quite what his kolsch style pineapple beer is, but damn its good.  Refreshing as hell.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
2107,"2012-03-11",4.0,"This one was what I expected after hearing about Jonathan Wakefield. On tap on Hunahpus day poured this hazy yellow brew. The nose was of pineapple, straw and yeast. There wasnt as much yeast in the taste, but a generous amount of pinapple. With the light carbonation - the fruity taste was crisp and extremely refreshing. A very nice beer to have while under the Florida sun.","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"
2107,"2012-03-11",3.9,"Poured a straw yellow color with aromas of fresh pineapple, more pineapple and some grain.  Flavor is majority of pinealloe with some grain, cereal and more pineapple.  Extremely session able beer that was great in the heat.","Florida, USA","burg326"
