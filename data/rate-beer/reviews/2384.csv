2384,"2016-11-18",3.8,"500ml bottle from Wine + Beer botteshop on Gold Coast (recommended). This is more an American-style red IPA rather than your average sweet malty amber ale. Plenty of piney and fruit-salad hops on the nose and tongue nicely balanced by a decent caramel malt bill. Medium body and carbonation. Dark amber appearance, ample off-white head and clingy lace. Enjoyed this one.","FNQ, Australia, ","floydian1"
2384,"2016-09-01",3.1,"TAP. Amber pour with thin head.. Nose is very soft; sweet malt, floral tones & musk.. Fruity hops initially goes to rusty earthy malt body with sappy caramel/toffee back end, metallic vibes by the end of the glass?? Sourced Fire Station","Busselton, WA, AUSTRALIA","Andrus86"
2384,"2016-08-20",3.9,"Keg at Frankies Sydney. Very complex. First sip is a flavour bomb. Bitter, sweet, caramel, sucrose, citrus, fresh but still dank. Crisp. Undertones of pine and maple. Yeah the maple kind.","AUSTRALIA","Dandm"
2384,"2016-02-11",3.6,"500ml bottle into shaker. Fruity dry hoppy nose, spicy, nutty, touch of pepper. Its all going on. Cloudy thick caramel sauce appearance with solid thin white head. Laces well. Cant see any carbonation. Bitter and full bodied. Finish is cashew sweet with aspirin bitterness which steadily increases. Beautifully balanced beer although I think this bottle may be past its prime. Not as intense as thought it would be but still very adult. Easy drinking too!","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","TedE"
2384,"2015-07-24",3.6,"Brewcult tap takeover at the Durham. Solid IPA, and I enjoyed it for that, but didnt have the caramel sweetness I look for in a red IPA.","Los Angeles, California, USA","RafeAU"
2384,"2015-06-19",3.6,"Sampled at GABS Sydney. Pretty good red ale, although I personally prefer stronger ones than this. A little thin for my liking, but really nice flavours. Worth a try.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Jmar33"
2384,"2015-06-11",4.0,"Fresh batch, good hoppy aroma, medium head, red/brown body, bitter finish. Another good effort from Brewcult","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","winkle"
2384,"2015-05-01",4.4,"Bottle from Craft (Red Hill) in Belgian Ale Glass. Wonderful aroma from a great trio of hops. This is a two-fisted brew strong on both malt and hops making for an excellent well-rounded taste. I first had this a year ago and it began my obsession with hoppy red IPAs. Glad its back!","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","ANZUShophunter"
2384,"2014-07-10",4.0,"From 500 ml bottle (nice label too). Pours a clear orange-brown with a creamy off-white head that lasts. Fine carbonation. Nose is great with pine needles, white wine, caramel, pineapple, mango and lemon. Taste is a blend of juicy tropical fruits at the front end before a lemon zest and pine needle bitterness rises in the mid-palate. More soft fruit and some rich sweet caramel at the end. Spicy and fruity aftertaste. Really enjoyed this.","Camp Hill, AUSTRALIA","Jado"
2384,"2014-06-25",4.1,"500ml bottle from The Wine Emporium 300314. Red to amber in colour with a strong malt aroma. Nutty and caramel flavours dominate.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"
2384,"2014-06-17",4.1,"Pours dark amber with a fading head.
Nose shows pine, lychee, sweet rich malt and some confectionery.
Very similar flavours, pine, fruity hops, sweet bready malt. Very easy drinking and moreish.
Nice moderate carbonation.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Davros"
2384,"2014-05-18",3.8,"From a 500ml bottle on 18/5/2014 (shared by Butz with thanks). Pours a dirty amber with a medium head. The aroma features yeast and fruity hops. Flavour wise, theres a background of caramel and biscuity malt, followed by lots of fruity sweetness (stone, citrus and tropical), and finished off by some firm bitter, lingering hops. The body is quite full and the carbonation average to lively. Nicely balanced and very well made.","Canberra, AUSTRALIA","Maris"
2384,"2014-05-05",3.7,"Good size fluffy off white head on a hazy dark red body. Decent hops on the nose, well balanced taste of the hops and malt, medium body, with a decent bitter finish. Enjoyable.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","bluevegie"

2384,"2014-03-18",3.0,"Quite an interesting beer. Not as red as I was expecting, and not as big a hop hit initially as I was expecting from the aroma. At first taste, almost a non event. But as it was in the mouth, it's flavours intensify leaving a warm malty, slightly bitter finish, with not a lot of sweetness you find in a lot of red IPAs these days. All in all a good drop","NEW ZEALAND","jcthebeerguy"
2384,"2014-03-15",3.1,"500mL bottle. Pours a cloudy red/brown with an off white head. Grassy/spice aroma with touches of pine. Pine dominates the flavour with a nice toffee backing.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","Brenhophead"
2384,"2014-03-07",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2014 Bottle from Mane Liquor. Pours hazy amber with a sticky beige head. Nose is very spicy and pine driven stuff - danky as they come with huge zesty tang to it. Taste is balanced tropical fruits and lemon tang, massive pine and dank with heavy spice to finish. Medium bodied and lacks bitterness to finish but drinks very nicely. Tasty stuff","Perth, AUSTRALIA","maneliquor"
2384,"2014-03-07",3.8,"Pours a dark amber with just a little super fine off white head.
Nose is so delicious and tropical! Pineapple, passionfruit, guava, peaches, slight hint of caramel.
Flavor is similar, fruity and tropical. Peach, pineapple and passionfruit flavors, a bit of toffee. Finish has a bit of biscuit, some pine, grapefruit.
Medium bodied but the lack of carbonation gives it a little bit of a watery texture. I suspect this is just a bad bottle, because Hendos carbonation is usually spot on.
Great looking, great smelling, great tasting. Very enjoyable.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Niksko"
