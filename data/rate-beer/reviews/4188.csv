4188,"2013-12-22",3.5,"Elle me semble rouge-rousse et limpide sous cette lumière tamisée. Peu de mousse la recouvre. Le nez est de caramel et de fruits séchés, de labricot au raisin. Un goût de caramel écossais nous caresse le palais avec du sucre de canne. Une finale épicée et poivrée qui est apportée par leffervescence. (916-131213)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","AlainG"

4188,"2013-12-08",3.6,"On tap @ LAmère à Boire (Montréal). Clear burgundy with a small off-white head and no lacing. Aroma is of raisins, caramel, dark fruits and cereals. Taste is also of raisins (a lot), mineral notes, caramel and cereals. Medium body. Low to moderate carbonation. Very raisins forward, very good.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
4188,"2012-12-26",4.3,"Je suis un peu biaisé quand vient le temps de la critiquer. Cest une des premières lager et une des premières de chez lAmère à boire qui ma marqué, pour pleins de raisons...et toutes ces raisons se sont rematérialisés dès la que je lui ai regouté aujourdhui, des années après la première pinte. Pour moi, ça reste la meilleure lager du Québec avec sa mélasse, cassonade, chocolat dans un corps parfait. Une finale de houblons délicat se pointe également, question de la rendre mémorable...encore plus.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
4188,"2012-02-02",3.6,"Un verre de dégustation.  Une robe ambrée.  Un petit col mousseux.  Quelques traces qui restent collées au verre.  Un nez de caramel et de sucre dorge avec des cerises et des fruits foncés.  Un goût bien malté, des bonbons au caramel fruité qui fondent sur la langue.  Une touche dalcool qui vient couper les malts doux.  Un corps moyen avec un pétillement modéré et une texture huileuse et légèrement collante.  Une finale sur un concerto de notes maltées.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
4188,"2011-01-25",3.5,"Dégustée en fût sur place. De couleur ambrée-rouge foncée et semi-voilée. Nez malté de caramel doux sucré aux notes rôties, légèrement fruité (raisins, traces de canneberges et de prunes) avec de faibles notes de levures. Moyennement ronde en bouche avec un pétillement moyen et une texture légèrement crémeuse. Goût moyen-léger fruité (léger de raisins, notes de prunes) lors de lentrée en bouche auquel se rajoute un goût malté de caramel sucré aux petites notes rôties avec des notes de pain et de toffee puis en finale lon retrouve des notes dalcool. Post-goût moyen, aux notes amères dalcool avec des notes de rôti et de fruits (moût de raisins). (hiver 2006-2007)","Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Viper666"
4188,"2010-12-05",3.0,"Une pinte servie sur place. Belle couleur brune orangée peu de mousse trônait. Nez avec des fruits secs et des épices. En bouche elle coule bien avec aussi des fruits, quelques épices et de petit goût rappelant les médicaments.","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","rodenbach99"
4188,"2010-03-07",3.3,"On tap at Lamère à boire
Appearance : Deep amber with a medium head. Nice lacing.

Aroma : Fruity, sweet caramel with some raisins. A bit mineral. Some alcohol.

Taste : Fruity raisins, some hops. Bitter with lots of malt. Quite mineral. A bit salty. Some alcohol.

Overall : A bit disappointing. Felt quite metallic all along. Maybe it was not in good shape...","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"
4188,"2010-01-30",3.7,"On tap at the brewery. Amber color, white head. Average malt presence in taste, as well as fruits (banana) and other sweet tasting elements (bubblegum). Overall a pleasantly refreshing experience.","laval, Quebec, CANADA","Roli"
4188,"2009-12-30",2.9,"09.12.29 draft @ pub : Clear copper color lasting head. Aroma: Caramel and alcohol. Full in body. Finish is sweet and short. I get caramel and perceive a bit of hotness from the alcohol.  A great winter warmer.","Chambly, Quebec, CANADA","punkska101"
4188,"2009-03-15",3.0,"Sample. Dark red. Lasting light head. Aroma of alcohol, berries and melon. Thin flavour. Alcohol edge. Flavour is lightly fruity, more maibock-like than bock.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
4188,"2009-01-05",3.4,"Tap at the Brewpub: Brownish amber in color with a fading light tan head. Sweet aroma with lots of chocolate-like reminiscence, raisiny qualities and dark caramel. Body is a bit slick and warming. Flavor is fairly sweet and alcoholic. Caramel meshes with peppery phenolics and spicy alcohol. A bit simple, but still decent.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"
4188,"2008-06-15",3.5,"1/15/08 notes:  Pours deep red/brown color, on tap from brewpub.  No trace of hops, a mellow malty caramel flavor that is very nutty and smooth.  Featuring a smooth, medium-thick mouthfeel, this is very drinkable.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"
4188,"2007-05-24",3.9,"Dark orange/brown in colour, small but lingering white head, no lacing.  The aroma is lightly sweet, lots of sugar, light yeast, some caramel and cereal.  The flavour is quite malty, good amounts of caramel sweetness, very light alcohol, plums and pears, roasty and yeasty.  Lightly bitter mouthfeel, medium body, medium carbonation.  Finishes lingering, some caramel sweetness and alcohol warmth.  Very good, wonderfully balanced and warm.
Draught at <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Place/quebec/montr%E9 target=blank>LAmère à Boire in Montreal, Quebec on December 27, 2006.","Peterborough, Ontario, CANADA","radiomgb"
4188,"2006-12-22",3.3,"Draught. Ruby-mahogany coloured body with a small white head. Cereal is present in the aroma and fruit (tropical hops). Lots of caramel flavour, sweet fruits (apple, pear, and some tropical stuff), bread, and spicy hops. Quite good and easily drinkable.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"
4188,"2006-12-13",3.3,"Clear burgundy body with a small tan head.  Aroma had an herbal/spices feel (nutmeg, anise, etc) although I dont think any of that stuff was used.  This is not a heavy malt orgy type of bock.  The medium body is not saturated with malts, it is rather fruity with berries flavour, the hops do show hop and taste like flower petals and there was a little minerals/sandy twist too.  I liked it but because of the state definitely need to re-visit it.  In the meantime, its back to reality, that annoying time between beer.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4188,"2006-03-03",3.1,"On tap at the brewpub.  Dark orange/brown, small very white head.  Some fruit in very mild aroma.  Sweet, fruity, and stale taste.  Some soft hops in middle and end.  Medium mouthfeel.  Alcohol as it warms and the fruit taste intensifies.  Peppery hops grow as well.  Taste was good after some initial staleness (although I thought all the beer I had the pub that night was a little off).","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"
4188,"2006-02-12",3.5,"Robe rouge surmontée dune mousse blanche en dentelle persistente. Arômes de malt caramélisé. Saveurs de sucre, de caramel, de raisins et de levure.","Saint-Ours, Quebec, CANADA","Miguel"
4188,"2006-02-08",4.6,"Un très bon goût sucré de caramel et de chocolat et très réchauffant, comme boire un chocolat chaud. Cétait ma permière dAmère à Boire et cela ma donné une trè bonne impression.","Boisbriand, Quebec, CANADA","Quevillon"

4188,"2006-01-13",3.7,"Mahogany color, with a beige foamy head, with some caramel malt, toffee, fruity and hint of nuttiness in the aroma follows through on a medium-bodied palate with a fruity and roasted malt caramel character, toffeeish and butterscotch notes, leading towards a sweet malty and soft bitterness finish.

4188,"2005-03-19",3.9,"Sweet candy malt aromas, lovely chesnut color, low head. Caramelly malt with low bitter. Dry finish. Great balance and sophisticated. Alcohol kicks everything up a notch and ties it all together well.","GERMANY","pivo"
4188,"2005-02-19",3.5,"Dark copper body topped with a thin off-white head. Very pleasant fruity (cherries, raspberries, mango, peach) aroma with hints of brown sugar. Taste is also quite complex. Fruity, sweet and flowery flavors with some toasty and nutty notes. Average finish with some arming effect. Very interesting product.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"
4188,"2005-01-30",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 14, 2005 Draft.  Dark ruby brown color with tan head.  Smoked malt aroma.  Smoked, caramel, and malt, this beer is very strong for a bock, could be a doppelbock.  

Bière dun brun très foncé avec des reflets rouge et un collet brun.  Odeur de malt fumé.  Au goût, elle est fumé, malté, caramel et tourbé.  Bien réussi mais elle est pas mal forte pour une bock, ce pourrait être une doppelbock.","St-Épiphane, Quebec, CANADA","hobgoblin"
4188,"2005-01-30",3.6,"Dark ruby when brought to the light, but almost blood red/black in the shadows, with light lacing that didnt last the whole pint.  In fact, during the last third, even after significant swirling, the head was dead.  Probably what I liked most about this Beer is the smell, the first whiff I could clearly detect the spicy Hallertau hops.  After a while my nose got saturated, and a vinious, prune and blackberry aroma came through.
Taste was caramel, roasted malt, with a spicy, alcohol finish.  Strange, because it sort of had the blueprint taste of a Barleywine, but with the bubbly carbonation and light to mid mouthfeel of a lager.  But an all around solid Bock from Montréals masters of lager.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"
4188,"2005-01-17",3.7,"Raisins, plums, mangoes and grapes in the aroma with full sweet malt sweetness.  Dark ruby-brown with decent tan head that recedes slowly to lasting cover.  Fruit flavours abound with plenty of thick, malts to chew on.  Some nutty and vanilla overtones.  Pleasant light bitterness and herbal/mildly spicy hop flavour takes the edge off in the finish.  Lastingly sweet aftertaste.  Nice strong carbonation engages the tongue while palate is full and thick with malt.  On tap at the brewpub with muzzlehatch.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
4188,"2005-01-14",3.8,"Dark ruby brown color. Smallish tan head. Big malt nose, Id definitely take this for a doppelbock. Fruity (peaches, mango) and desserty sweet, almost reminiscent of vanilla, but rather balanced by the strong toasty nuttiness and earthiness. Decent hop bill shines through toward the finish and carries the sweet malt into a long aftertaste. Full body, rich and malty. One of lAmères most straight to the point, but just as well executed.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
4188,"2004-05-02",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 28, 2004 Very little head, very nice red color with some coper hues.
Pleasant and powerfull aroma caramel malt and fruits. Extremely enjoyable flavors of fruits and burnt caramel. I really love this seasonal beer.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
4188,"2004-03-20",3.9,"Very nice deep brown copper beer with a nice fruity aroma, raisins and vanilla, slightly vinous. Wonderful sweet malt, oranges, and nuts combined with some alcohol warmth. Good balance of hops and malts. This is almost like a barleywine. Excellent body...best tasted so far from Amere.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
4188,"2003-03-31",3.2,"Like most of the other beers here, very sweet, but for once this is not a debit.  Brown sugar, hints of molasses, very little carbonation, but a strong enough ending hoppiness to keep it from syrup.  Not great, but nice.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
4188,"2003-03-11",4.1,"The bock beer brewed at this brewpub is fabulous. It is dark amber in colouration with a rich munich malt aroma.  It is very malty with a fairly strong hopiness that I've only experienced at Denisons in Toronto for this style.  It has a rich silky mouthfeel and wonderful synergy between malt and hops.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","dhurtubise"
