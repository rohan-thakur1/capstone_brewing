4537,"2015-07-20",3.5,"On tap during early April VT road trip, sampled at Black Back. Although usually not my favourite style was pretty impressed with this one, Matt wanted his glass back after I kept on stealing it to sniff and drink! Hazy light mahogany with a tan head, A clean and crisp cereal and grain aroma, some straw and hay, easy to drink with a moderate carbonation and mild body, slightly sweet but well balanced.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"
4537,"2015-05-27",3.6,"Bottle from Martys, drunk 5/19/15Deep copper-brass pour has some brighter golden hues to it and a medium to small white head that slowly recedes to cover. Clarity is high.High minerality and tons of grassy and dry hay-like hoppiness in the nose seems to be fading fast. Never too sure of the bottling dates on their stuff (HINT HINT), but I suspect this one has sat on the shelf for a few months. Still, highly clean, with light sourdough bread notes and some sweet honeyed malts. It all comes together well and delivers an authentic interpretation.Same, not-quite-as-fresh-as-it-could-be flavor still boasts no flaws or problems. The carbonation seems to dissipate quickly in their bottles that sit, so this one was a little undercarbonated as they usually are, but it created no major problems. Mostly just highlighted the malts which are very well-attenuated here. Spicy hoppiness is real but still an afterthought. As usual, the challenge remains of getting JA beers as fresh as possible without the aid of a bottled on date....As Auerbrau goes on about their beers not being very good in his review here, I think he is an (unsuspecting) victim of having a very passed-its-prime bottle (though Im a bit surprised he dosent realize its the shelf age and not the beer).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4537,"2014-04-16",2.3,"16oz Bottle, purchased at Yankee Spirits - Attleboro, MA. The fact that this and the Sunny Ridge have been rated so high makes me think that nobody is thinking critically about Jacks Abbys beers lately and are just raving about them because of past work. This pilsner is regrettable and languid. Aroma is a generic pilsner malt aroma, not very distinct. Overall, this tastes like a homebrewed pilsner before its finished conditioning and carbonating. Theres not nearly enough gas in this brew and its covered with a vague gauze of banana yeastiness. The malt character is defined by a moderate white sugar sweetness and not much else, with hops failing to pick up the flavor quotient. Messy, unfinished, and unremarkable. Disappointing.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
4537,"2014-02-02",3.5,"Damn good, easy drinking pilsner. Finely hopped and refreshing. Clarity of this beer is beautiful.","Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerathon"
4537,"2013-12-09",3.5,"$3.90 for the 500mL bottle purchased from the brand-new Learys which just opened in Amesbury. Honeycomb yellowish amber, it pours. Fine white ringed head, half a sliver in length, aye aye. Aromas of wheat bread, bitter orange peel, and boatloads of noble hops, yeast and topsoil. This is undeniably crisp, but is it fun? Yes, yes, I think it is. Hops and malt dance harmoniously. Nice nice nice. Caramel, pistachios, and wool. Dont undermine the hops, damn you: Saaz, Saaz, Saaz! Its good to be noble in these times of woe and want.

Ill take another.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"
4537,"2013-12-06",3.3,"Strong, husky malt aroma, surprise citrus and a touch of bar soap. Clear golden color. Initial bitterness fades into a nice mellow, dry sweetness. Just crisp enough but too soft to really crack the whip. A very classic pils, and this brewer was overdue for one.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","Scrapersnbeer"
4537,"2013-11-27",3.7,"Bottle from Colonial Spirits.
Pours a slightly hazy medium golden color with a smallish bubbly bone white head that quickly dissipate to a cap on top. Aromas of spicy hops and rich bready lightly toasted pilsner malt make up the aroma. Clean rich lightly sweet bready toasty malt offset with spicy earthy hops. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a lightly sweet slick bubbly mouthfeel. Really nice Bo Pils here. Clean, simple, flavorful.

4537,"2013-11-10",4.1,"500mL thanks to WillFunForBeer. Pours a sparkling clear golden, thicker white lacing. Nose takes its sweet time to open up. At first its soapy, loads of orange perfume. Finally it opens up to beautiful pale malt grist, oatmeal, fresh oranges. Taste is exceptionally biscuit malt, flashes of DMS from the pilsner malt, nice perfumey orange. Palate is rich, thick biscuit. Really solid Pils here- impressive.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
