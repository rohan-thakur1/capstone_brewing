4503,"2004-06-27",4.3,"Huge bodied dark beer. I was expecting syrupyness, but it was suprisingly light. The first beer Ive had over 12% which wasnt some kind of supercharged lager, and I found this excellent. Really put the wine in Barley wine.","Zillebeke, BELGIUM","Hugh"

4503,"2004-05-07",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2007 2005-04-01, 8-4-8-4-16=40Cloudy dark amber color; huge head. Quite sweet aroma, malty, alcoholic, light vegetables and very light mint; then it develops the hop aroma. Sirupy, malty; really sweet. Would be great with some more bitterness. A real Barley Wine.2004-05-06, 8-5-8-4-17=42Hazy dark amber color; fine perlage; huge thick head, persistent, magnificent. Strong (sweet) malt aroma, Barley Wine like; palm sugar; very light yeast and fruitness. Malt syrup, correct bitterness. Very sweet, which also helps hiding very well the alcohol.Far from being complex, but really enjoyable for a late evening. I like it!","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
4503,"2003-12-12",2.9,"Cloudy orange brown color, medium head. Aroma is sweet candy sugar, apricot, raisin. Taste is very sweet, like sugarwater, some caramel malty notes, bit alcohol. Alcohol is quite well masked actually, but the beer is a bit unbalanced. Sweet and alcoholic palate.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
4503,"2003-06-16",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2014 Purchased at De Bier Koning in Amsterdam on 5-25-03. Very sweet malty nose on this brown beauty. Scent of raisins and white grapes stands out. More raisins and fruit with some brown sugar in the body. Very sweet, indeed. Finishes very smooth with a slightly bittersweet aftertaste. Good beer. Quite possibly one of the sweetest Ive ever had. Old review scores - 7, 4, 6, 4, 12 for a 3.3 score.

Kept a bottle of this and boy has it improved! Was expecting a mess and possible sour/infected beer. I couldnt have been more wrong. Still sweet but not sickeningly so, anymore. Much like a Rochefort 10, taste-wise. Still carbonated as well. Dark brown with a medium, foamy tan head. Aroma is sweet malt, dark fruits, candi sugar and brown sugar notes. Taste is dark fruits, sweet malt, caramel and candi sugar. Medium bodied with soft carbonation and none of the 14.2% showing up. Ends with more caramel, dark fruit notes, candi sugar, sweet maltiness, dark bread and rum cake. Delicious!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
