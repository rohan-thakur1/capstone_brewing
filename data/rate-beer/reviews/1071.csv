1071,"2015-01-06",3.7,"750ml bottle 13 Vintage (Courtesy of TerryR)-pours a clear light golden with a bunch of floaties. Aroma of pears. Taste of pears, tartness, and sweetness. This light bodied beverage is well balanced and goes down very easy.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","Headbanger"
1071,"2014-08-30",4.0,"750 corked bottle shared with family. Straw color with a long lasting thin white head. Aroma of ripe pears. Flavor is more of the same with a nice balance of sweet and tart. Refreshing and enjoyed by all.","Oswego, Illinois, USA","TerryR"
1071,"2013-07-10",3.0,"750ml bottle, dated 2011. Filtered or disgorged so theres no sediment and the pour is a clear light-hued ripe bartlett pear greenish-yellow. Sweet and juicy core of nondescript apple and pear with light pepper phenols. Juicy-juice simplicity with a watery, thin body. Nice enough to drink, but lacks the barnyard that the Brut had, and seems sweeter and thinner like a soda.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1071,"2011-06-30",2.9,"Corked bottle from Le Comptoir du Terroir, Paris; vintage 2008, 2 years oldThe bottle was under a big pressure and the cork exploded loudly. It pours a very pale straw color, and there is no head retention. The aroma has a cheap fruit side (apples and steamed pears), but also a bit of the typical French cider character. The mouthfeel is lean and semi-dry, with medium-light fruit flavor. The final is short. Quite well made, but you cant expect much from a perry.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

75cl bottle at parents house. Foggy light yellowish appearance, with quickly disappearing white head. Aroma is pear, and more generally fruit wine. Taste is only a little sweet, with heavy carbonation. My first perry to date, so my ratings may be a little off...","NETHERLANDS","WillemG"
1071,"2010-11-29",4.1,"Pours with just a little head and a foggy white colour. Nice aroma of pear perfume and hay notes. Taste is absolutely stunning- a variety of sweet and bitter pears combine with an excellent mouthfeel so that it literally evaporates on your tongue, leaving a light and soft taste of various pear tastes. Easily the best perry Ive tried to date.","Alberta, CANADA","DeanF"
1071,"2010-10-23",3.6,"Bottle. Pours a very light straw with a steady stream of bubbles. Billowy white head disappears almost immediately. Earthy slightly sour aromas dominate with a little pear. Flavours show lots of sweet jucy pear up front. Acidic sourness leads to a very dry finish. Medium mouthfeel with very lively carbonation. First perry I have had. Like it.","AUSTRALIA","bluebetty"
1071,"2010-10-04",3.6,"Corked and wired 75cl bottle. The label states that the ABV is only 2.8%. It pours like a champagne with a billowy white head of short duration. The nose is er....pears with a strange cheesy sock-like edge for some reason. The palate is light and wispy with nicely subdued sweet flavours. Certainly tastes better than the nose would suggest. I enjoyed it, and so did the wife, but have to admit that I thought it was a French farmhouse-style beer when I hurriedly bought it.","FNQ, Australia, ","floydian1"
1071,"2010-08-28",4.1,"Bottle @ home, shared with ComradeKPours a pale straw colour, with fair carbonation evident. The aroma is mixed, it consists of pleasant fruit notes (mostly pear, though) but has an unfortunate undertone of soap to it. Luckily this is the worst thing you can say about this perry. The flavour and palate are fantastic; excellently balanced and presents a very rewarding brew. A wonderful perry, well worth trying.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Blockley"
1071,"2010-08-28",4.1,"750ml bottle shared with Blockley. Pours a clear straw yellow, with an initial large head that soon dissipates. The aroma is a bit odd, with hints of almond, savoury pear and a slightly disturbing soap smell. Thankfully it improves as one tastes it. It begins with some sweet lemon and pear, with some tart acidity in the middle and a sweet pear finish. A quality perry, somewhat different to those in the English tradition with which I am more familiar.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"
