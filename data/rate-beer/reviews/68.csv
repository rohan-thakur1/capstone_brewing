68,"2016-12-03",2.9,"650 ml. Deep copper-brown body has a light haze. Sizzling soda pop head disappears immediately. Nose is allspice and cinnamon. Taste is overpowering spice from the get-go. The only saving graces are a hint of pumpkin-squash flavor and a bit of dark roast flavor. Later the finish develops some pleasant cherry and almost tobacco notes. Medium-heavy body is out of balance with the sweet-earthy spices dominating. A nice touch of alcohol warmth. Quality ingredients show, but this is basically a spice bomb, with little evidence of pumpkin.

Small, tan foam completely dissipates. 1/3FLAVOR: Robust palette throughout. Pumpkin bread up front with sweet brown maltiness.

68,"2016-09-09",4.0,"22oz bottle. 8/11/16 bottle date. Appearance: Brown with a deep amber hue, clear, with a light khaki foam head. 
Aroma: Nice pumpkin spice heavier on the allspice, nutmeg and clove, with a light cinnamon and vanilla. Light caramel. Very nice
Taste: Surprisingly sweet maltiness, a touch of bread crust, then turning to a allspice and nutmeg forward pumpkin spicing. Cinnamon is restrained. Moderate bitterness to balance the intense malt sweetness and spicing. Comes across like a pumpkin spiced piece of toast. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a low to moderate carbonation. No noticeable alcohol warmth. 
Finish: Toasted malt stand out, with some nutmeg and allspice. 
Overall: A really well done pumpkin ale that nicely balances the maltiness, spicing, and high ABV. Nice toasted and caramel malt backbone and spicing heavier on allspice and nutmeg, compared to the cinnamon bombs of some pumpkin ales. Alcohol well hidden for its strength.","","TH28"

68,"2015-11-26",4.2,"Poured a cloudy dark copper color with about a 2 inch khaki creamy head. The head dropped to a clingy film in a few minutes. The aroma was full of fall. A good hit of nutmeg, pumpkin pie spices, caramel malt, cinnamon and ginger snaps. The beer had a thick creamy texture. There is a nice malt backbone with all the flavors to match the aromas. Good pumpkin pie spice flavor, nutmeng, cinnamon and towards the finish a light bitterness of ginger snaps. All the aromas & flavors of Thanksgiving in a bottle. As a side note I had this about a month ago at The Icehouse in Punta Gorda, Fl. It was on a nitro tap and you had the option to get the rim coated with cinnamon sugar. The nitro made the beer more creamy. I tried it with and without the cinnamon sugar rim. The coated rim made it more of a dessert beer. Great either way.","Florida, USA","gpekar"
68,"2015-11-17",4.2,"Pours a very hazy and very dark copper/burnt orange color that spears almost chestnut brown in the glass with dark orange edges and a two finger, off-white head that quickly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Sporadic streaks and spots of soapy lacing left behind. 

Spicy, autumnal aroma with lots of sweet pumpkin along with tons of earthy, zesty spice. Smells like an aggressively spiced pumpkin pie puréed into a glass. Has a similar dessert-like quality as Pumking with more malt and complex spice profile and less sweetness. Hints of roasted pumpkin, pumpkin pie filling, nutmeg and vanilla along with clove, ginger, coriander, cinnamon, brown sugar and allspice. Sweet caramel malts underneath with hints of toffee, tobacco and leather. The spice profile is very musty, earthy and is a nice counter to the sweeter pumpkin pie characteristics. One of the better smelling pumpkin beers that Ive had. 

Full bodied for the style with a nice balance of pumpkin pie sweetness and earthy, zesty spice notes. Strong organic tasting pumpkin and pumpkin purée/pie filling up front with prominent nutmeg, vanilla, brown sugar and allspice countered by a more musty, rustic spice profile that has hints of peppery clove, ginger, cinnamon and cardamom. Theres a nice malt backbone giving off more sweetness with hints of caramel, toffee, toast and biscuit. Slight boozy sweetness in the finish but there is no heat at all. Drinks incredibly well for 8.5%. In addition to the complexity, there is incredible balance. The spice presence is really strong taming the pumpkin pie/dessert sweetness and theres just enough sweet malt and pumpkin character preventing it from feeling overwhelmingly spicy. I can see how this could be a bit too much for some but I think its a great take on the style. One of the better examples of what a pumpkin beer can be.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

That being said, I really like this beer for what it is. Everything is very much in balance - the pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice, sweetness, and body.

68,"2015-08-24",2.7,"How: Bottle (22 oz). Shared at Mont-Carmel tasting. 

>>> A cloying nutmeg bomb with too much spices, sweetness and alcohol. 

-  Clear orangey amber with a medium bubbly beige head and little lacing. 
-  Nutmeg is really intense and overpowering everything else. 
-  Its rather sweet as well which, combined with the intense spiciness, is the perfect recipee for a cloying beer. 
-  If it wasnt enough already, the beer is also boozy. 
-  The pumpkin character isnt super fun either, its borderline rotten. 
-  Its not horrible for a pumpkin beer, but its still not something I could drink more than 2 oz. Im sure a Bud Lime Pumpk-A-Rita would be easier to drink.

There is an off white head that just leaves a couple soapy spots on the glass. The aroma is typical pumpkin beer. Heavy on the cinnamon and allspice. This one has a little more pumpkin and marshmallow going on with a decent graham cracker crust. I like the aroma on this more than I like most pumpkin beers. The flavor is very similar. There is a nice toffee addition on the flavor, and thats about the only addition. The mouth feel is pretty decent. Its not as thick as I would like it to be, and the carbonation is just light.

This was poured into a tulip. 
The appearance was a nice looking hazy brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute leaving some slight lacing sliding into the beer.
The smell had a really maple-ly sweet maltiness running over top of some bready and spiced pumpkin notes. Light vanilla slightly runs in and out. 
The taste was mainly sweet through the maple and allowing a gentle pumpkin pie - esque vanilla to come through.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation hit my tongue nicely - good for the style and for me.

(ALM) Boozy barrel vapours along with lots of sweet malts. Oaky and sort of leathery too. Hint of an oncoming infection, sourness and lactic acidic roams about (6). (GoT) Roast, charred wood, leather, light spices and honestly underwhelming. (5) A clear win for the more traditional Good Gourd Impy.  TASTE:  (GG) Much like the aroma, the taste is quite as expected. Sweet malts, light pumpkin flesh and a good amount of spices but not too much. Light alcohol presence along with some finishing earthiness. Quite enjoyable (8). (ALM) Much like the aroma, lots of barrel influence, quite noticeable rum and oak notes. Spice are there too add roundness but it seems a tad flushed out. Does taste far better than it smells (7). (GoT) Much like the aroma it is heavy on the roast, nutty and charred character with faint spices and little to no squash notes. Some dirty earthy coffee tones as well... and just like the aroma it is underwhelming on the palate( 6). Yet another victory for the more traditional brew!  Mouth Feel The GG is just where I expected, smooth and slick, right amount of heft (4). The ALM is sharper and still oily, yeah I like this palate slightly better (5). More disappointment for the GoT, ashy and thin, minimal carbonation makes it worse (1).  OVERALL:  A clear win for the straight forward Good Gourd Imperial Pumpkin Ale (15) over the rum barreled GG Almighty (14) and the distant inbred cousin Gourd of Thunder (9) which before this I would have figured would have been my favorite but alas was a huge letdown.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Thanks to tastybeer for sharing one more beer before we called it a night. The highlight of the evening, this was a pretty robust pumpkin ale with a bug body. Much like other Cigar City beers it is above average and on par with some of the Elysian specials.

Aroma / Appearance - A nice one finger bubbly head rises like yeasty dough. The ruby base looks like cooked squash drained into a glass. Nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, and pumpkin give it the festive autumnal texture you would expect. Graham crackers finish off a big nose.

Flavor / Palate - Spices, cinnamon, apple pie, and graham crackers fill one with the components of a Thanksgiving dessert buffet. Sweet pumpkin pie with a generous dollop of whipped cream completes the feeling of a liquid feast. If I have a complaint it might be borderline too sweet (close to Pumking). Fortunately it doesnt fall over that cliff into mediocrity.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

68,"2012-10-18",3.2,"In short: A typical spicy pumpkin ale, a bit toasted and a bit on the sweet side.  Decent if you like the style
How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed when approximately 8 months of age.  Bottle from fat ass GodOfThunder
The look: Cloudy dark amber body topped by medium beige head leaving good lacings on the glass
In long: Nose is typical pumpkin beer spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.) over a sweet pastry.  Taste is very sweet (not surprising from CCB) and with a sweetness that feels like pure sugars more than rich maltiness.  Body feel rather airy and fluffy, full of yeast, low on malts but somehow high on sugars.  Like crunched melba toasts in a yeast soup and a lot of toasted sugars.  Quite spicy and this helps to hide the sweetness.  Ive never been a fan of the unofficial style of spicy pumpkin ales, and this beer is not going to change that fact.  Average for this pseudo-style I guess.  My wife liked it a lot more than I did but she has the worst taste in beer and in men.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

S: Big pumpkin. Very pure in nature, definitely the best pure pumpkin smell Ive got from a pumpkin ale. Light cinnamon and some pie crust were also present.

T: The pumpkin is integrated very well with the spice and neither dominates. The pure pumpkin is nicely woven with the cinnamon and slight hint of nutmeg as well. This is laid nicely on a pie crust backbone that is leaning towards the sweet side.

M: Light bodied, very drinkable. Nice sweetness is left on the palate. Nice carbonation.

This has a dark amber color, cloudy, with a frothy white head.

Pumpkin and spice really dominate the aroma. Some other spices in the periphery.

Some light caramel malt lead into the main attraction - strong, spiced pumpkins. Cinnamon and nutmeg are the most dominant. 

This only has a medium body despite the high ABV. There is what seems to be an off-feel to it, maybe some pumpkin residue. The finish is a little bit grainy and my mouth feels coated in plastic after my glass is done. 

There was something about this beer that struck me as off. The feel was a little bit light, and there is some pumpkin residue flavor that is not appealing to me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"
68,"2012-03-10",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Cake-y spices and light toast ride this Pumpkin Ales expansive carbonation, creating a fun example.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-An initially creamy head of foam bobs dwindles into the cloudy amber shine.
-The mouthfeel is quite supple for a strong brew.
-Alcohol is well hidden throughout.
-Spices are well expressed in the nose, but tend to feel incohesive in the flavor profile.
-A soft hop bitterness concludes each sip.
-Malts dont offer much in the way of flavor.

Overall : Nice. Taste was slightly disappointing because the nose made you expect more pumpkin spices. Nothing bad but not my favorite pumpkin beer.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

Let it warms up a bit to give it a fair shot as the initial smells and sips were less than favorable.  Nose still is giving off a slight wet dog smell and I am quite sure it is not my glass as I smelled it before pouring.  Getting past the wet dog there is lots of sweet pumpkin fruit, nutmeg and cinnamon.  The flavor is more bitter and tart, some dark fruits, strange yeasty (almost tastes like a belgian yeast or maybe thats just the rotting pumpkin flesh) thing.  Some light sweetness in the flavor but it doesnt mimic the nose as many beers tend to.  An interesting pumpkin ale but it didnt blow me away.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

Smells like autumn without the prosaic spice medley of cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg thank god. Taste- really not as heavy as you would think. A well attenuated palate allows you to demolish this beer in record time barely getting to experience the baked dessert, toasted pumpkin seeds, and pie crust.

68,"2010-12-12",4.2,"Appearance: dirty orange and pumpkin hue with some bloody hues settling along the bottom. No head or foam; second-hand growler fill (thanks hopscotch).

Nose: spices, stewed pumpkins and not just of the Halloween variety  gourds and more gourds. Nutmeg, all spice. Apples, red please. Raw brown sugar, raw cane sugar. Earth and farm.

Palate: light to medium mouthfeel and very clean which carries the flavors well. No evidence really of her generous 9.9%ABV. Starts to dry palate, lingering with dry spices, apple skins, and gourd bits; stem and skin. Brown sugars and cane sugar, raw and unpolluted with sweet saccharine sugars. Nutmeg lingers in the breath. Apple pulp. Starts to grow a faint tart twang/nip in the back as warms up a smidge. Spices are subtle, appearing then disappearing then reappearing here and there. The sense of real gourds and not just the pumpkin kind (in a can) really stands out, mingling with the raw spices.

Final Thoughts: I really enjoyed this take on a spiced pumpkin beer from Cigar City. Choosing not to go the usual route of sugary maple sweetness with spices and the pumpkin in a can that we all have grown to know and love. This was all about pure raw gourds, the orange kind included, along with natural spices and sugars with zero hint of her potency. Yum!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

68,"2010-10-16",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 17, 2011 Growler from the brewery.  Let me start off by saying that Im generally not a big fan of the fall themed pumpkin and Oktoberfest beers.  Probably my least favorite season for beer.  So, with that said... pumpkin spice nose with nutmeg and cinnamon standing out but not an over-powering aroma.  Hay and caramel round out the scent.  Deep amber color with a very thin head that doesnt stick around.  I gave it a few aggressive swirls to bring something back.  For what its worth, the second pour (yep, went for a second pour of this!) maintained a thin frothy head so perhaps intially poured too cold.  Surprisingly, I didnt find this to be too sweet.  Theres a roasty element to the flavor that I rather enjoyed with some bitterness.  The pumpkin flavor is not overdone and the usual pumpkin pie spices are here.  Once again, cinnamon and nutmeg come to my mind.  Straw and grassy notes mix in.  Theres a bit of alcohol that creeps in towards the finish but Id say the drinkability is good with this one for what it is.  If someone were looking to be floored with sweet pumpkin pie flavors then they might be disappointed.  I kind of thought this tasted like a Pumpkin Ale and Strong Amber hybrid.  Again, I usually avoid these beers when they hit the shelves (or in this case the tap) but heres one Im glad I tried and overall I thought was pretty good.

68,"2010-09-21",3.6,"snifter at brewpub.  aroma is nearly smoky spice with nutmeg prevalent.  lack of cinnamon as seen in every other beer of the style is a pleasant surprise.  appearance is well hazed tangerine with spotty lacing and tiny film head.  flavor is gritty nutmeg up front, more general spice follows.  grittiness continues and booze is present.","River Grove, Illinois, USA","satan165"
68,"2010-09-20",3.5,"Cigar city good gourd. Mason jar growler from hopscotch... Pours a dark  
reddish caramel with a thin light beige head... Aroma of pumpkin  
flesh, light ginger and spice... Flavors are semi-sweet with an  
earthy, semi-bitter pumpkin accents and more subtle spice notes. Smooth body and carbonation. Gets better as it warms, good for the style, but i found it somewhat lacking overall.

68,"2010-09-17",4.0,"Finally, a pumpkin ale that I like.  About damned time on this one.  Thanks to my good friend Hopscotch for this one!  Pours a cloudy deep copper color with medium off-white head, lots of lacing.  Aroma obvious of pumpkin, herbal hops, decent but not overdone spice, just a nice balance of nutmeg, coriander, and an herbal balance.  Flavor matches well and only gets better as it warms to room temperature.  This is just a great beer that doesnt try to make pumpkin pie out of a beer.  Its a beer.  Not pumpkin pie.  Want me to say it again?  Thanks CC!","Macomb, Michigan, USA","dmschefke"
68,"2010-09-17",2.6,"At first whiff I thought ""hey this is gonna make a pumpkin beer lover out of me"" with its clean pulpy pumpkin nose, no pie spicing, reminding me of pumpking. But there was something else in the nose on further analysis, an herbal cherry cough drop element. And then on first sip I found to my disappointment that the cough drop part was taking the forefront over the pumpkin.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
68,"2010-09-15",3.9,"Draft @ the Treasure Coast beer fest. Pours deep orange amber color wih off white head. Aromas of cinnamon and nutmeg. Tastes like pumpkin pie; cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. Medium body with average carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden for such a big beer. One of the best pumpkin beers Ive tried.","Winter Springs, Florida, USA","smith4498"
68,"2010-09-15",3.8,"Growler thanks to Blazer06.  Pours a hazy orangish, pumpkinish color with a creamy white head and great lacing.  Can I just say that Cigar Citys beers almost all give great head?  Its true.  Excellent pumpkin pie aroma.  Not too overspiced, and theres noticeable pumpkin.  The flavor is also a great balanced pumpkin pie.  Lots of spices, including cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and maybe coriander.  Medium-bodied with a very smooth mouthfeel and silky carbonation.  Very good for the style.  Really enjoyed this.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

68,"2010-09-07",3.9,"On tap at the brewery. Hazy orange brown pour with a thin off white head. Big pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon and hints of spicy hops.

Creamy and delicious, this is as big a pumpkin ale as Ive had and as good.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
68,"2009-03-29",4.6,"A: Pours a nice clear brillant punkin orange hue with a nice tall creamy head. The retention is very good with spotty lace noted.

S: In the aroma department this one is hard to beat, it is neck and neck with Southern Tier Pumpking here. Huge real pumpkin aromas with a wonderful mix of spices. There is a real buttery crust element in here as well that I have never picked up in another beer. Even after the beer was gone from the glass the aroma still wafted from the empty glass. This one smells better than those $20 candles the wife brings home.

T: The flavors are wonderful as well. Real pumpkin, a perfect mix of pie spices, and oooh that gooey butter I detected. The pumpkin stands out without the spice overpowering. This one is a perfect mix between the pumpkin beers of DogFish Head and Southern Tier. I will quickly become a favorite of the pumpkin beer lovers.

M: Medium in body, smooth and creamy.

D: I tasted this one when it was first finished and the booze could really be detected. Since it has aged a bit, the alcohol flavors have died and the pumpkin, spice, and buttery goodness have come together to create one wonderful brew.","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"
68,"2009-02-15",4.0,"Deep pumpkin pie filling color. Creamy luscious nose is like the whole pie including whipped cream--a nice sweet and spicy combination. Unique for a pumpkin beer, similar to pumpkin ice cream. Creamy soft carbonation. Gentle, mild but assertive, spicing is integrated and not overpowering. The predominant spices are nutmeg and cinnamon as opposed to clove and allspice. Gets spicier with each sip as it warms, tastier too. Not in the least bit vegetal. Nice, smooth and sophisticated character. Nice malts and a good alcohol dryness in the finish. Super.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
68,"2009-01-05",3.9,"Thanks to Joey for the taste.  Pours a pretty roasted pumpkin color with a thick tan head.  Nose is more fresh pumpkin and spices, reminding me of a fresh baked carrot cake.  The taste is not overly spicy, which makes it highly drinkable.  I almost get some banana in the flavor, too.  Everything tastes fresh and not artificial at all.  Also, a very substantial mouthfeel.  This is an excellent pumpkin beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","GodOfThunder"
68,"2008-12-28",3.9,"Draft at the brewery, courtesy Joey and Wayne.  Let me come right out and say it....this beer DESTROYS Pumking and every other traditional pumpkin beer I have ever had, and it is not even close.  The pour is lightly hazy and orange-gold in color.  A substantial, lasting, spongy head of cream colored foam leaves dense legging and a soapy wash of lace in its wake.  Aromas of fresh pumpkin explode from the glass, followed by notes of graham cracker crust and whipped cream.  A light dusting of nutmeg, cinnamon and clove finish things off with a subtly spicy kick, but there is no mistaking pumpkin as the star of the show here.  Flavors follow suit, reasonably spiced pumpkin pie notes dominating, complete with graham cracker and hints of creamy lactose.  Medium-full on the palate, with light carbonation, the body perfectly matches the sweetness that the flavors impart without venturing into cloying territory.  Generally speaking, I hate pumpkin beers, so as many who are close to me can attest, this is a ringing endorsement for this brew as the hands down king of this overplayed genre.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
68,"2008-12-28",4.1,"Tap and Bottle. Pours a slightly hazy orange gold with a small white head. The aroma on this beer is freaking amazing. Tons of whipped cream on top of lightly spiced pumpkin pie and a hint of graham cracker crust in the finish. This beer smells like pumkin pie in a bottle. Taste is pumpkin meat, caramel, heavy cream, light spices, and a touch of hot alcohol. Medium thin mouthfeel with a mild amount of bitterness and slightly hot alcohol in the finish. A damn fine beer.","Florida, USA","afterglow"
68,"2008-12-26",4.3,"Bottle courtesy of Retorp. Pours a golden caramel color with thin white head. Aroma is pumpkin, spice, nutmeg, cream. Flavor is much of the same with some stronger pumpkin and spice notes, heavy cream flavors, slightly boozey. Generally medium body with a pleasing herb/spice finish. This was an amazing pumpkin beer and likely the best that I have had.","Tampa, Florida, USA","kiefdog"
68,"2008-12-24",4.3,"This is the best pumpkin beer I have ever had, bar none. Kudos to CCB! Pours orangey gold witha nose of pumpkin pie with whipped cream, booze, ice cream, cinnamon, spice, and graham cracker crust. Flavor is equally deep and sonorous. Finish is lingering pumpkin with sugary goodness. When I started drinking pumpkin beer this is what I wanted. Please keep this bad boy around.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
68,"2008-12-24",4.2,"Pours orange with viscosity and quickly dissipating tan head. The aroma is huge thick rich pumpkin goodness. Smells like a slice of fresh baked pie. Around the edges of the aroma are notes of graham crackers and cinnamon. It smells just amazing. The taste is just like the nose with solid fresh tasty pumpkin with cinnamon spice and pie crust mixing to create a graham cracker sensation. The alcohol presence hits midway and thins it out some. It ends on the dry side with nice rich pumpkin and spices lingering deep into the after taste. This is what I want a pumpkin beer to both smell and taste like. WOW!!!","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
68,"2008-12-23",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2012 Draft This beer rocks!... Murky caramel-colored ale with a small, creamy, off-white, orange-tinted head. The aroma? Wow! Literally one of the best things Ive ever smelled. Smells almost too good to drink. Its a warming blend of the very best pumpkin pie and pumpkin roll my grandma used to make. Full-bodied and oily with gentle carbonation. Tastes wonderful. Sweet, spicy, bold and boozy. Nice bitterness. Finishes pumpkiny, spicy, minerally and bitter... then, POW! - buttery graham cracker crust really breaks through the warming, lightly salty finish! World class beer!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
