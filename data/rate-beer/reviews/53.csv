53,"2013-05-12",3.6,"375ml bottle.  Pours a very dark brown, almost black, body with a nice tight bubbled frothy brown head that left some delicate lacing.  The nose isnt all that different than the regular version of this, still lots of chocolate malt and lesser roastiness, and the chipotle chili pepper that underlies it all.  Theres a little touch of smoke and barrel character to this, but its pretty minimal, just a slightly medicinal note.  The flavor (at least at this point, the bottle is several months old from the date of purchase), is dominated by the Porter notes of chocolate malt and light roast.  The chili pepper is still in here, but the level is pretty subtle with just a light spiciness on the late finish.  Minimal suggestions of the smoked malt.  Hard to really pick up much character from the barrel treatment.  Except for the light medicinal note on the finish, I dont really get any barrel character.  Medium to full bodied, very chewy and thick for this ABV, soft minimal carbonation level.  Pretty enjoyable Porter, but I think the pepper was a bit more aggressive when it first came out (Didnt rate it way back when).","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

53,"2013-03-28",3.8,"In short: A surprisingly rich bourbonny small beer with mild hot spiciness.  Very good.
How: Bottle 375ml, consumed with some age on it but still 8 months before expiration date.
The look: Black body topped by a large brown head with good retention.
In long: Nose has only light notes of the hot spiciness of the base beer, 
Taste is loaded with creamy blackened malts, a lot of vanilla, rich caramel, woody bourbon, well integrated mild notes of hot spiciness helping to distract from the sweetness, some peat, soy sauce, notes of creamy chocolate fudge.  Very full body with a tickling carbonation.  There aintt many low abv Bourbon Barrel Aged beers out there, but this Texas Ranger Barrel Aged offers a corpulence and an intensity that can match that of most BBA beers twice its size.  Quite different from the base beer, less spicy and with a better integration of the spices, less chocolaty, richer body and of course more vanilla and bourbon.  I actually much preferred this barrel version over the base beer.  I love beer, apparently Im an obsessive beer drinker, but in reality when Im at home I often go 20 or 30 minutes without even thinking about opening a bottle of beer, sometimes even more (depending on how long it takes me to drink the last bottle I opened).","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

53,"2012-01-19",2.5,"A tall, rough light beige head thrones above the black liquid. Not particularly pleasant nose focusing on ashes-like roasted malts with unsubtle corny, cerealic, rough bourbon connotations and more timid smoke/damp earth, anise and cigar-like nuances. There is not much else really, not much fruitiness to speak of, little alcohol and the chilis are not too obvious except for the smokey tang. In mouth though, its a different story. As the sips follow one another, the chipotle pile up their firey spiciness and are actually interestingly smokey, but the ash-like nature is perhaps not the best fit, making for a rough combo. It feels stronger than it is too, both because of the heat and related flavor intensity and because of the impressive, coating palate. Intensely tasty, perhaps too much so to be considered anything close to drinkable. Frankly, I found it unpolished and heading in every directions in mouth. One second, it seems that bourbon dominate, the other, chipotle, then ashes take over and there is not the appropriate bridges between those flavours for it to be called complex rather than rough and confused.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Det er efterhånden lidt tid siden jeg drak denne øl, og selvom mine noter består i bedste velgående er smagsindtrykkene efterhånden lidt slørede.
Jeg har skrevet at dette er et knaldsort bryg med flot, let luftigt, brunt skum og givet det et 4-tal. Dertil kommer så en krydret og humlet aroma med masser af chokolade og lakrids. Smagen afslører en ret sød udgave af en porter med masser af chokolade. Dertil kommer en undertone af sæbe, en let chilibrænden, noter af let træ og whiskey, men umiddelbart virker denne porter ikke så udpræget barrel aged som andre af Mikkellers øl. Dette skyldes måske at det er lykkedes at skjule alkoholen bedre, og alt i alt synes jeg da også at denne mængde af træ og whiskey er mere passende for ikke at overrumple resten af smagsindtrykkene i  Mikkellers altid gode øl. Humlebitterheden er hverken for kraftig eller glemt i baggrunden til fordel for lakrids og chokolade - nej, tværtimod velplaceret og velbalanceret. Derudover en yderst blød øl i munden, og virker overraskende let trods sine tunge smagsnuancer. Dette bidrager til endnu mere balance mellem det voldsomme og det smukke i dette forrygende bryg.","Nysted, DENMARK","flemmingwillum"
53,"2011-10-04",3.6,"My Bottom Line :  
Fruity vanilla, roasted malts and molasses dwell in a sticky body lightened by fierce effervescence, while toasted, wooden notes take control of the finish. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A rich head of foam slowly depletes into the darkness. 
-Vanilla-like bourbon is present from nose to aftertaste.
-Soy paste allusions are found.
-The mouthfeel is very heavy; there is no alcohol presence, but otherwise you might think this is close to the 10% range. 
-Smoke and chipotle are subdued at this point, overwhelmed by the hefty residual sugars. The regular Texas Ranger is friendlier AND more complex.
-For lovers of big beers, this one offers the potency of a 10% Imperial Porter without the alcohol heat and its effects.

The aroma offers up black licorice covered chocolate balls and chocolate brownie as well as a mild level of sweet smelling bourbon. The taste has yummy toffee to dark chocolate notes to start and then running into some spicy black licorice followed by mild and sweet bourbon and wood.

53,"2011-01-24",4.4,"Well after trying the regular version on tap at Cask in Pimlico, I had to get the BA version, I also have a 75cl of the normal version, which Im yet to try, so all my comparisons with this version are versus the keg regular. Pours out really oily, jet black and shiny, brilliant coloured head, deep mocha brown, thats the colour that all dark beer heads should be, proper job! Aroma is totally hedonistic. Supercharged rich chocolate truffles, dark choc, belgian choc, a whiff of tar, smoke, big mineral character, roasted coffee, roasted malts, thick vanilla and american oak, this is all held together by a nice amount of boozy Bourbon, but not at all over the top, finally you get a peppery hint of Chipotle Chilli, an aroma I have recently gotten to know very well and is now unmistakable.  Flavour is powerful but remains well balanced and nicely complex (what else would you expect?) Id say you get an initial burst of all the flavours at once, then they segment into mids and finish. The up front rush is all the aromas following on to the palate, with an added punch from the chili. As it breaks down the earthy, tar/smoky notes lead, then you get massive choco vanilla combo, with a real slick oily mouthfeel, then the pepper notes from the Chipotle start to fade in with Bourbon and dark chocolate, some more sweet toastiness from the oak, then back into more bitter choco, ash, mineral and finally the last burst from the chili to finish. Totally cracking stuff. My only complaint, is that I preferred the heat from the original, I feel here the aging has mellowed the chili heat, but on the plus side the oak has padded out (what was already a pretty dense body) even more and made it super drinkable. Top marks.","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"

53,"2010-12-27",4.0,"375ml silver wax dipped bottle, best by 06/15/2013.  Pours virtually pitch black, with the slightest possible glint of reddish-mahogany showing at the far outer edges in the presence of a strong backlight.  A small, foamy, medium-brown head pushes out to a solid, frothy ring with a wispy center film.  Small, rounded spots and short snakes of lacing mark the glass.  The nose is really quite nice.  Based in the obligatory dark chocolate malt, which comes across mainly fudgy and sweet, the barrel has imparted notes of fatty coconut, vanilla créme, and caramel kissed bourbon.  The oak influence seems to have covered up a bit of the smokiness from the chipotles, and while still present, the capsaicin spice has also been tamed, coming across more as a mild, fruity, fleshy pepper scent.  Smells quite delicious, actually.  The barrel has done the aroma well.  Flavors follow the same pattern, sweet dark chocolate showing most prominently, accompanied by caramel and mildly toasted, vanilla-kissed oak.  Coffee emerges as it warms, giving some roasty character.  Chipotles lend moderately spicy, peppery heat, but the star of the show is that creamy coconut, which again proves delicious.  Good stuff!  The palate is appropriately round and oily, very slick and viscous, with fine, active carbonation there to aerate it a bit.  Bittersweet chocolate concentrates on the slightly drying finish.  Very good brew overall.  The barrel marks a noted improvement over the base beer, without a doubt.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

The beer ours a dark brown to black color with a brown head. The aroma is roasted malt with some chipotle pepper and oaked notes. I seem to remember the original having a very similar aroma, only with the oak addition. 

The flavor is oak, chipotle pepper, chocolate and some roasted malt. The flavor is very nice. One of the main differences from the non barrel-aged version is that the heat from the peppers doesnt seem to be as intense in this version. That is not a good or bad thing, it just is.

I wanted to taste this side by side with the regular Texas Ranger, but that was sold out at the bar - no wonder:)
Fantastic appearance with high lasting dark brown head on a black body. Looks like a dessert.
Nose is warm and maybe a bit alcoholic. Roasted flavors and bourbon flows from the glass.
Taste is roasted as well with that fine bourbon addition - and then the chili kicks in. Maybe not as apparant as the regular? Anyway, I like that the chili is not in your face, but just something that adds to the complexity together with the bourbon barrel aging.
I do not really detect any hops. Has the barrels killed that or were they not there in the first place? Hard to believe with a Mikkeller brew.
So is this better than the regular? Maybe just slightly - but I would be happy with a couple of bottles of the regular in stead of one 37cl bottle barrel aged at the same prise.
Anyway very fine brew.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","jesperhammer"

53,"2010-07-26",4.5,"Bottle 37,5 cl. A pour as black as they gets with an impressive dark brown head that just stand massive with a fluffy foamy attitude. The nose is sweet malty with lots of roastyness and coffee notes. You sense the mild smokyness andsome smooth wooden flavours. The taste is awsome. Rarely you get a bourbon aged beer that are balanced. too often the bourbon cask turn the most lovely beers in to sweet vanilla bombs that are so sweet that you hardly can finish your glass. You can taste the smoke and the mild burn from the chipotle chillies wild the roasty the sweet and the bitter notes blends together in perfect balance. The oak and the smoke also seems to go hand in hand ver ver nice. The mouthfeel is rather thick and one should think that we were dealing with a beer with a mutch higher alcohol percentage. The finish is long and joyfull with a mild throatburn from the chillis. I think it is impressive that not the bourbon aging nor the chilliea are taking over the picture, but together adds to a very nice and unique beer. Lovely","Copenhagen, DENMARK","lassem"
