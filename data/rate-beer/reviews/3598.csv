3598,"2017-04-30",3.9,"From Aushopping Petite Forest : Dutch Bitter  >> Bière blonde de visu fort avenant : une belle robe orangé livrant un col épais et crémeux avec beaucoup de saveurs maltées et un beau nez aromatique. Superbe attaque sur lAmarillo: fruitée à la mandarine, à labricot et au raisin mais fuyante à cause dun faible ABV. Heureusement, son maltage intense charnu contre-balance bien le milieu de bouche: la gorgée devient très agréable quand je découvre que je goûte un biscuit au carmel fruité et moyennement amer légèrement herbacé et qui laisse une longue sensation sablée granuleuse au palais. Bière bien équilibrée qui se savoure en deux temps grâce à un usage parcimonieux de lAmarillo et généreux du malt cara. #391 IBU:38 - PLATO:9 - EBC: 24","Braine, BELGIUM","poech73"

3598,"2015-04-14",5.0,"Une bitter américaine de 9° plato pour 4,5 % abv, et niveau ebu de 42.
Elaborée avec du malt pils et cara, du houblon Sladek pour lamertume, et de lAmarillo en late hopping.
Couleur roux moyen abricoté (ebc de 23).
Voile de levure assez dense.
Bulles fines en colonnes sur les parois, vives.
Mousse blanc cassé, qui forme un nappage superbe à 2 mm .
Arômes de malt grillé, agrumes douces, avec un zeste dorange. Merveilleusement fleuri et équilibré, je reste de longues minutes à humer ce parfum subtil.
1ère bouche soyeuse sur un malt clair, amertume très plaisante, fleurs blanches.
Arrière-bouche de grande saveur, fleurs de haie.
2ème sur le malt grillé, bonne tenue du fruité avec un fleuri distingué.
Arrière-bouche bien fraîche, longue, précise.
3ème sur un malt finement grillé, bois de chêne blanc.
Arrière-bouche très précise, sans faille.
Longueur dun admirable équilibre, douceur, saveur.
Jambes un peu marquées, et lisses pour une autre part.
Levure bien nette, un peu épicée, poivrée, très belle veine.
Alcool tout à fait opérant sur les saveurs, et en préservant lamertume.
Finale au nez toujours aussi merveilleux, et avec encore dautres nuances en bouche.
Il faut la boire par toutes petites touches pour percevoir toutes ces nuances.
CONCLUSION : la bière du retour des beaux jours (28 ° aujourdhui), avec son cortège dagrumes,
son beau houblon, son malt finement grillé. Mais le nez dentrée, qui se retrouve dailleurs à la finale, mérite déjà à lui seul quasiment un 5, un parfum digne de Dior ...","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

On the first sip I didnt really think this should count as a bitter but going through the bottle I realized it was, the malt and especially yeast qualities fit in with the ESBs and bitters Ive had.
