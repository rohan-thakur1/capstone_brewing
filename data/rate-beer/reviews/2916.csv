We bought this bottle, sort of forgot about it, moved overseas, left it in a dark basement for a few years, found it, moved it to a fridge, etc, drinking it today.

Appearance: Clear golden with a small bubbly white head and little lacing. 

Aroma: Ok, shit is getting real here, literally. Wherever you are when you smell this, your mind will think you are on a dairy farm. Really impressive. Massive dank hay presence and cow dung from a dairy cattle. Ok, theres also overripe apples and really nice funk, but its just to remind you that you are drinking cider (on a farm).

Taste: Less expressive than the aroma, but still super tasty. Impressive farmhouse character. Wet hay, overriple apples and moderate tartness.

Palate: Light to medium body. Lively carbonation at first, but quickly become light and prickly. Semi-dry finish.

The cider is very aromatic, floral & earthy with a lot of wet limestone and some nice tart apple. There is some mild barnyard funk to it, but its sort of lingering in the background. 

The flavor is largely dry with just a touch of apple sweetness up front. Its got a nice minerally character and a really good tartness throughout. There is a touch of spice and a nice bit of leather. The apple skin bitterness is low but well employed here. The acidity is both bright and well balanced & never becoming too dominant.

2916,"2013-05-17",3.4,"Wow, at first I was really disappointed in the overly phenolic, almost band-aidy character in this. I discovered pouring the dregs in the glass helped to mute the harsh (almost smoked meat) funkiness a bit. Sweet apple aroma is covered by brett funk with a spicy edge. Taste is sweet cider up front, then goes medicinal, hinting at smoky band-aides. I thought it was fairly drinkable with the yeast mixed up, but still very funky. The closest thing I have had to this was the Brownslane from Crispin, but this is more funky. Weird to me, but maybe this is traditional?","Asheville, North Carolina, USA","BeerZack"

Every time I go back for a sip I get that funky wild yeast aroma, expect to find it in the flavor, and find myself a little disappointed its not there.

The effervescence level is high, making it a little too gassy and burp-generating. But thats also what makes it look so alive. The meaty part of the palate has balancing sweetness.

Big, fizzy, faltering head. Regenerative froth. Insanely active gold body. This thing is pissed off! 

Hard to smell it because of so much CO2 filling up my nose. Minerally, apple peel, & sulfur. Finally settling down a tad, I get fragrant, floral apple flesh, creamy/concentrated apple juice, & just enough acidity.

Taste is lighter then the smell would suggest. Sizzling, but softly beaded carbonation. Bittersweet apples & unripened tart fruit flesh. Thin. A bit yeasty. Lots of wood.

Final Thoughts: whoa A champagne of ciders to be sure. Of the earth. Terroir. Dirtoir. Laden in orchard bloom, musk, dew, and juicy breeze. It would be interesting to see how this cider would age and so I must acquire another bottle or three.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

2916,"2011-10-26",3.9,"2009 bottle thanks to GT2! Just starting to get into real cider, and man am I glad Ive entered this realm. Nose holds a delightfully complex earthy and dry presence that mixes with complex apple skins, pear juice, and even a touch of unripe plums or the like. The flavor brings more of that wonderful dry earth tone that reminds me of an old-school saison, then melds into the fruity apple flavors, and finishes with a hint of mushroom and herbs that are certainly welcomed. Medium effervescence, still fairly sweet but with touches of dryness on the finish. Excellent.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

Overall: very good. The taste is very nice... but I was expecting a little more due to the aroma - aroma is more complex than the taste, but it does taste good.

After the initial rush of bubbles exhausts itself, steady carbonation forms a few foam island on the surface. The aroma is at first earthy and sour, followed by a lungful of horsey brett funk... after a minute or two, scents of dust and old cheese also become prominent. A happily, surprisngly apple-y flavor- stewed Granny Smiths with a nod toward Fijis- and accents of salt, cinnamon, and smoky creosote. The palate is quite oily and crackles with poprock fizz. The coda consists of a puckeringly tart finish and oily-bretty tonguecoating aftertaste. Although many of the individual components are... unexpected,... the cider as a whole is (accidentally Im sure) quite interesting, complex and refreshing.","New Mexico, USA","maltdog"

Aroma very much akin to an unblended lambic:  full of tart, sour notes, along with green apple.  Flavor, however, is a reserved blend of sweet apples and mild alcohol.  Body is medium, with light carbonation.  Overall decent, though I found the flavor to be underwhelming given the dynamism of the aroma.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"

This is like taking a bite out of a fresh juicy apple, but there’s that soft funkiness that really adds to the complexity.

Slowly the bubbles rise to the top and form a white ring around the edges of the glass.  The nose is subtle apple with faint notes of wood, cheese, band-aid, must, and barn.  The flavors bring out stronger notes of funk, cheese, and a sweet apple flavor that quickly finishes on the woody, cheesy, dry side.  I probably should have held on to this for another year or two as I think the funk will grow, but as of now, its still quite nice. Very woody, sweet, but then dry at the same time.

2916,"2008-07-07",4.3,"2005 vintage: Pristine yellow gold. White head nosily fizzles as it slowly diminishes into a consistent, well-retained collar. Zingy, saliva-inducing aromas of unripe peaches, grass, melon, leather, bandage, dried apples, and musty basement. Notably minerally as well. Hints of iron and cedar. Soft, big-bubbled crackle of carbonation. Soft, well-rounded lactobacillus tartness immediately fuses with a bright kiss of explosive fruit which packs supple weight and a high concentration of refined sweetness. Notes of leather and oak gorgeously contrast with the slick body and remarkably succulent apple character as they lend light grip. Complexity is through the roof, and the balance is awe-inspiring. Brett-derived phenols crisply sparkle with pinpoint definition which echoes the equally snappy apple profile. Perfumey esters enhance the lift and bolster the quaffable nature of the cider. Borderline-brisk acidity lightly buckles the cheeks as it lends slight firmness to the otherwise resoundingly juicy body. Faint apple skin bitterness complements the structure as it harmonizes with the poignant yet artfully understated oak character. Tannins are nonexistent which allows the fruit to showcase its pureness. Acid continually teases the palate as it wavers in and out of the dense residuals. Lovely interplay between dryness and sweetness as it finishes with a lengthy fusion of pineapple, peach, musty cellar, and vibrant apples. Both a rustic and extravagant cider from Frances finest. Not stocking this by the case should be a sin. This is divine.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Smell: Whoo! After such ""lite"" ciders, this is quite a surprise. The earthy, musty, and downright barnyard funk youd find lurking in a lambic. Beyond that, theres a strong bandage scent which, after checking out some of the other reviews, seems to be hit or miss on differing vintages.

Taste: Beyond-ripe apples with a heavily yeasty, funk-filled taste throughout, like horseblankets from a haunted house built atop an indian burial ground. Brief hint of flowery, herby bitterness. Quick flash of salt. Some mildly sweet notes of apple preserves show up on the finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Almost no carbonation.

2916,"2007-06-26",4.1,"2003 750mL bottle drunk on 5/26/07Interestingly enough, I had the non-organic version of the same year, though it was only 2 years old, vs. this 4 year old bottle.  I certainly cant tell the difference from the organic and non-organic version, but obviously, the difference in age made the difference in flavor.  I think this one is probably best around 2 years old, as it was just a touch tired at 4 years, with tons of dryness and a little bit of paperiness on the finish.  That being said, it was still absolutely delicious, and full of fun wild yeast notes.  Never overdone in barrel character, the wood only adds a moderate layer of complexity that does not outdo the apples.  Lots of vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and cheesy lacto character, with a champagne-like effervescence and quenching body.Lacing is provided as well, and the clear liquid shines a brilliant gold with a thin white head perched atop that falls quickly, just like champagne.With age, also, comes stronger, more earthy flavors and aromas, gaining more ""farmy"" character and less clear brett, lacto, oak delineations.  Quite well-homogenized in to one big wild, sweaty, cheesy apple concoction.  Moderate sweetness still exists.  Its incredible to see how theyve managed to keep some residual sugar from being eaten by the critters.  Moderately acidic finish may be a bit too aggressive, but is certainly nothing unusual for the style.  Splendid as always from Dupont.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2916,"2007-04-12",3.4,"2004. Hazy pale body, no head. The aroma is light horseblanket and cheese with plenty of tart apples. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly tart, lots of juicy apples sugars. Medium body is practically still, soft and sticky.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"
2916,"2007-04-04",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 31, 2009 Original Rating, April 4, 2007:  Hazy orange color with no head.  Aroma of slightly tart yet sweet apples.  No carbonation apparent.  Musty apples, almost slightly rotten, like way past ripe.  Grassy.  Tastes almost corked, but the cork doesnt show any signs of mold.  Not too good.  6/3/5/2/9   Re-Rating, July 31, 2009; 2006 Vintage:  Hazy yellow color with a very thin head.  Aroma of hay, honey, apples and a little pear.  Smells a little tart.  Very dry apple flavor.  Crisp and lightly tart.  Earthy, horse barn, and a cellarish must quality.  Very glad I decided to retry this.  Certainly worthy of being in the Etienne Dupont family.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
2916,"2007-03-29",3.2,"Nice sour smell to this one.  Cloudy honey color.  Body on the other hand is very sweet and exactly what Id expect from a cider.  Lots of apple with a little alcohol.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
2916,"2006-11-24",3.2,"2004 Bottle... Very hazy yellow cider with a brief, tiny, fizzy, white head.  Tangy, acidic nose with notes of sharp cheese, barnyard funk and freshly cut Bisquiet apples.  Flavor is almost heavily sweet and very humbly tart. I was hoping for more acidity and/or dryness. Tasty though. Medium-bodied with stale carbonation. Finishes sweet and fruity, then only modestly dry.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

Hands down the best cider I have ever had, And I have had quite a few. Golden yellow color that looks like it is alive. Darker around the edges off the glass ( like wine )  It looks so nice I had to go show my wife. Armors of way more than apples. The oak comes through clear as a bell, along with some light herbal fragrances.  The teats is to die for. More think and dense that I was expecting. The herds and oak are here to. Carbonation is way less then I was expecting. Similar to a lot of stouts or porters, not like other ciders that are more like sparkling wines.  Highly recommended. It like a elixir of life.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Adverse2Bitter"

2916,"2006-07-13",3.2,"2004 corked bottle and served in my NB flute glass: Poured a hazed yellow color with minimal head or lace. The aroma has notes of Macintosh apple and a hint of earthy and barnyard funk. (This smells more like a fruit-lambic then did the Lindemans Apple (Pomme) I just had) The taste is over-ripened apple flesh with just a note of allspice. It seems that whatever is there in the fermentation caused a yeast-like funk that added to the depth of palate. I like this the more I drank it. When I mixed this equally with the Lindemans Pomme, then I got what I really wanted in the first place.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
2916,"2006-07-08",3.4,"2003 bottle. Kept in refrigerator since early 2005 and finally opened today 7-8-06. Ill admit that Im not a cider drinker but I did find the aroma to be mouth watering. Green apples and hins of spices.  Tangy cider flavor with hints of lemon peel and pumpkin pie spice. Slightly acidic finish. Like I said, Im not a cider fan but Ive never enjoyed a cider as much as I enjoy this one.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","Magjayran"

2916,"2006-05-28",4.2,"2003 bottle. Picked up at Brawleys in Charlotte. Flippin beautiful. Cider poured a hazy medium yellow with a small, frothy, white, diminishing head. The aroma was a simple,sublime symmetry between apple and yeast. The nose was packed with fresh, sweet fruit and moderate-to-heavy funky notes of lemon, barnyard and cellar. The flavor was heavily sweet, trace acidic and lightly bitter with a short, lightly acidic fruit-juice like finish. The body was medium, the texture was water-to-velvety and the carbonation was fizzy. An increadible taste; I find myself craving it. It also gets even more points from me for being a great example of how beautiful simple, whole foods can be.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","luckygirl"

2916,"2006-04-17",4.1,"750mL Bottle: 2004. Organic, unpasteurized. Looks good. The pop of the cork doesnt yield too much of a pop, more like a slight sigh. Not too much head retention but you can see the carbonation as you pour it into a glass. The nose is both sweet and tart with some light sulfer notes and a pleasant apple juice bouquet. A bit funky, but not too dry or old smelling. The flavor is lightly sweet with a lingering syrupy apple taste that tickles your tongue while the smell of dusty wild yeasts plays a bit with your nose. The finish is perfectly balanced and overall this is a great cider. Perfectly balanced to lovers of both gueuze-like funky french ciders and the pleasant sweeter ones you find from most other areas.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
2916,"2006-02-10",3.7,"This will be my first ""good"" cider, but I must admit I like the cider-pop brands every once in a while.  2004, found in whole foods.  Pours with no real head, just some bubbles which dont last.  Cloudy, orange color.  Aroma has apples, yeast, apricot, peach.  Easy on the tongue, little carbonation.  Tart flavor with apples, lemon, pears.  Not particularly sweet, very dry finish.  Overall its smoother than I expected, not too funky at all.  Very pleasant experience.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","theshocker"
2916,"2005-12-12",4.0,"Bottle from Total Wine, Cary, NC.  Turbid gold pour with almost no head.  Huge aroma of forest apples freshly pulled from the hooha of an excited woman.  Tastes sweet and apply up front, with a malty, funky mid-palate.  Not terribly dense or complex on the palate, but very refreshing, and it gets funkier (which is good) as it warms.  I didnt find this one to be dry, but rather very sweet and apply.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"

2916,"2005-05-16",3.4,"Bottle:  Two bottles from Schroppfys gathering.  I know the 2000 was courtesy of wolhfs and I believe the 1999 was courtesy of the host.  2000 - Has a sour tart apple aroma.  Pours a most transparent yellow with a touch of haze and a very small white head.  Flavor rather simple and comes across like a spritzy apple juice.  1999 - Sediment in this glass but thats probably just from getting a different portion of this bottle.  Aroma is more sour and tart.  Flavor is funkier, a little sweetier, and theres some woodiness.  Definitely better than the 2000.  Bumped up the aroma 1 point, flavor 2 points, and the overall 2 points compared to the 2000.  Ratings posted are for the 1999.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

2916,"2004-09-26",3.7,"Ok now we are talking! A cider that isnt a sticky sweet alcopop. The apperance is a cloudy yellow. The aroma is apples of course but a touch of lemons and bread. The taste is a litte on the thin side but flavorful nonetheless. It doesnt have an overload of apples in the flavor. There is a certain lambic type quality to this thats hard to put a finger on it. Woodchuck are you taking notes, this is how its done. I cant wait to try more traditional ciders.","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
2916,"2004-09-01",3.7,"2003.  Certified USDA Organic.  Hazy golden hay with a thin, white head.  The aroma is mostly sweet but also slightly tart.  Tart apples, funky yeast, leather, a bit of wood and a hint of honey.  The body is fairly good, but the carbonation is sharp and lively.  The flavor is pleasant with a nice sweetness up front, some mild funkiness in the middle and a tart, dry finish.  Really a pleasant cider with a lot more going on that I expected.

2916,"2004-08-03",3.6,"2003 Bottle Date, Sampled August 2004Pours with a frothy light tan head that quickly disappears.  This is not nearly as carbonated as the standard version that I had, and it is quite hazy in appearance.  As I pour it I get a solid fresh apple aroma, as I go in for a deeper smell, I get a solid fruitiness, and perhaps a bit of funky, musty type aromas, but it is not as complex as I was hoping for.  A bit sweeter than the normal version as well, and it tastes much more of fresh apples as well.  It has a nice level of carbonation that causes the cider to dance across my tongue.  I think that only using one apple variety has lessened the complexity of this cider a bit.  Nice and refreshing with a medium body for a cider.  A nice drinking cider, but I prefer something with a bit more complexity and a bit more funk.  This would be a good introduction for those not familiar with traditional ciders.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
