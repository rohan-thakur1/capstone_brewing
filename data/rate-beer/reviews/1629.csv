1629,"2017-04-30",2.4,"sweet plum smell....no alcohol burn...very clear appearance...taste is smooth, lightly sweet but one dimensional.... quickly gives all flavor away to a low alcohol burn...taste more of the alcohol and less flavor after a couple sips....that kills it. The little bit of flavor is gone pretty quickly and I liked less the more I drank :( had cold...next time I will warm","Columbia, South Carolina, USA","geologyguy"
1629,"2017-03-22",1.6,"Mostly clear with a slight pinkish hue. Pretty dry, with some very subtle hints of fruit in it. Nose is much harsher than the taste on this one. Seems to have hints of acetone, too.","Snohomish, Washington, USA","maxwelldeux"
1629,"2014-11-29",2.5,"It offers some fruits, here I´d say some bananas and pineapples, But is also tastes a bit too sharp, too spicy and and a bit harsh. Like a cheap german beer which was told to be a Pilsner brewed within a day. Expected more balance in the taste and a wider range the aroma. Cheap, tough, mediocre.","Wanne-Eickel, GERMANY","MichaelAwesome"
1629,"2014-11-29",2.8,"Bottle from Dae Yang in Düsseldorf. The Sake has got a watery clear-very light hazy appearance with a medium body. Aroma of yasemin rice and flowers. Taste of mild rice, mild flowers, roses, vanilla and grains. Watery and thin mouthfeel with lack of body and taste. Had better Sakes.","Reutlingen, GERMANY","McTapps"
1629,"2013-11-30",2.7,"The aroma is light with alcohol and bamboo. The appearance is clear. The taste is Luke the aroma. The palate is thin. Not much to talk about but good.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
1629,"2013-11-30",3.2,"Dry tasting with taste of grass, bamboo. Fresh water. The palate is clean with a heavy grain alcohol taste.

1629,"2013-04-12",3.1,"Sake at Sushi restaurant in Portland, OR. Clear as water with no head. Nose is ricey with fruit sparks. Tastes a little sweet. Very nice and oily texture. Fruits in the finish.","Chevy Chase, Maryland, USA","altonbrownd"
1629,"2012-10-18",3.3,"Bottle that my lovely wife brought home because it was brewed by a woman.  Pours like water, clear with no head.  Soft wet rice on the nose, big old melons, chewy yeast and koji, rather pretty actually.  Medium bodied, smooth and oily.  Mouthfeel is definitely oily, sweet and warm.  Light off flavors, weird faint tartness, a touch of plastic.  Interesting, tangy, more old melon and yeast.  Decent enough, but goes downhill from the nose quite quickly.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
1629,"2012-07-16",2.7,"Pale yellow. Sweet plum and fig. Full sweet. Totally dead carb. Sour alc. Rich fruit, dry alc finish. Classic Sake","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
1629,"2012-05-28",3.2,"Two servings chilled, 15% bottle, served in a small ceramic cup at Beach Palace Cancun, Mexico.  Mostly clear with small yellow hue.  No head, medium body, no lacing, and nice light sweet aroma.  Taste is sweet.  First sake, liked it.","Charleston Area, West Virginia, USA","weihenweizen"
1629,"2012-04-20",3.0,"Had as Yaegaki Blue Bottle, from Specs .. . Pours a clear water .. hard unripe melon nose .. . light rice, unripe melon, pineapple skin, and very sweet nail polish whiffs .. . alcohol is quite apparent, tingles on the tongue .. . quite a bold sake, but a bit to sweet and a bit to alcoholic for me.. . . its called Lost for a reason...",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"
1629,"2011-01-19",3.4,"Bottle from Epcot Japanese Pavillion. Pours almost clear and, with a swirl, leaves some really nice legs. Fruity melon notes balanced with dry chalky yeast dryness. Very clean taste, much more of the chalky yeast in the taste with only hints of the fruitiness. Just an ok Ginjo.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
1629,"2010-08-26",2.6,"bottle at home ... room temp ... crisp clear ... little viscous ... dry rice spirit ... rough spirit front ...medicinal spirit ... smell ok but it otherwise yeuch ... itle less rough warmed ... but this is definitly at the bottom end of the sake ive tried","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","cgarvieuk"
1629,"2010-05-19",3.3,"Clear with decent legs. Aroma is of light berry. Taste is of booze and then...nothing.","Arlington, Texas, USA","jkwalking05"
1629,"2009-12-31",3.4,"Flask. Poured clear with a bit of cloud.  Spicy aroma.  Spicy, peppery flavour with a peppery finish.  Drink cold, it cuts the sweetness of teriyaki dishes.","Munchen an der Willamette, Oregon, USA","troopie"
1629,"2009-12-19",2.9,"(Bottle, courtesy of ericandersnavy)  Pours a transparent lightly yellow tinged body with cascading legs.  Aroma of vanilla, marzipan, chestnuts, and melon.  Flavor of vanilla, florals, and nuts.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
1629,"2009-10-27",3.3,"Bottle thanks to ericandersnavy.  The look is very clear, some legs.  The smell is rice, almonds, sweet, and alcohol.  The taste is watery, nuts, and alcohol.","Dallas, Texas, USA","travita"
1629,"2009-10-20",3.0,"bottle thanks to bhensonb.  poured clear with some nice legs standing up the glass.  i dont think i washed my glass out good from the super thick mead i just had because the aroma was pear, honey, and butter.  the flavor was like the water left in the pot after boiling rice.","Denton, Texas, USA","Rosebud butternuts"
1629,"2009-10-10",3.5,"Bottle thanks to ericanders.  Looks like water.  Smells very floral with hints of mint and light fruit.  Decent leggings and a pretty bland flavor.  The big flavor comes through in the aftetaste with flowers and light alcohol.","Dallas, Texas, USA","mar"
1629,"2009-10-02",3.2,"bottle, thanks to ericandersnavy, clear yellow color with sweet rice and vanilla aroma, flavor of celery seed, vanilla, rice kernels, dry somewhat rough finish","Dallas, Texas, USA","blutt59"
1629,"2009-10-02",2.9,"Bottle thanks ericandersnavy. Pours with a clear golden body with decent legs. Aroma is buttery with koji, coconut and umami. Taste is papery and dry and a bit acidic. Reminds me more of a cheaper futsu than a higher quality ginjo. Very thin.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1629,"2009-09-12",2.9,"Bottle from a Nugget Market in West Sacramento, CA. Pours clear as water. Aroma is very coconut. Medium body. No carbonation. Flavor is sort of fungus. Sort of rice. Semi-tart. In terms of lacking fusil oils, this is one of the best sakes Ive had. Its finishing with hints of fungi, a little bready, a little tart. Considering Ive just finished a honeywine, this sake has substantial dryness.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1629,"2009-01-29",2.0,"Clear, cream-colored brew with slight sage tint. Koji-forward aroma with coconut meat and vanilla creme as well. Relatively thick mouthfeel. Goes down very hot! Has a hint of overripe custard apple.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
1629,"2008-12-21",2.2,"Had from the big bottle, which is not blue.  Slight greenish-yellow colour.  Full koji nose has sweet, doughy overtones.  Somewhat harsh on the palate, with lots of alcohol and a slightly acidity late.  Tart, woody character.  Definitely a bit rough.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1629,"2008-12-01",3.1,"The Yaegaki comes in a characteristically Japanese unassuming package - cold and lucid looking, both the bottle and the sake.  The aroma is funky and redolent with the scent of koji, with some deep and earth qualities and a pronounced lack of acidity.  It slides around on the tongue, loose and thinner than water - surprisingly light for a sake in my limited experience.  The flavor retains the scents of koji though on a quieter level, but at about mid-taste a surge of alcohol burn roars towards the back of the throat, before petering out and collapsing into a fairly demure but all-the-same scouring alcohol burn.  This is indeed a dry sake, but Im disappointed I couldnt catch any subtler flavors like other reviewers have listed.  Straight out of the refrigerator the koji flavor is clammy and introverted, but closer to room temperature it really begins to shine, really showing off that Japanese love for umami.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
1629,"2008-10-07",2.7,"Bottle from Ralph’s. Pours clear with just a hint of color. Strong candy-like aroma. Kind of smells like those puffy orange candies with some alcohol added. Slightly sweet flavor. A little graininess. A hint of fruitiness. A bit of alcohol as well.  Fairly easy to drink.","La Mesa, California, USA","mjg74"
1629,"2006-10-15",2.7,"Long tall legs on top of this lightly hued clear liquid. The hue gives it a slightly ""dirty"" appearance, but the legs make up for that. Aromas of almond, marzipan, and coconut milk. Some must and unripe berries as well. Somewhat uninteresting in scent. Some more coconut milk influences in the flavors. Alcohol burn and light sulfur. Light acidic finish. Somewhat cleansing, but then again so are a lot of alcohols. Not exciting in an area.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1629,"2006-08-29",2.9,"Purchased in June 2006 - $4.99.  The sake pours to a very clear watery, ultra light yellow (have to hold it up to a white background).  Light sugary legs.  The aroma is strange.  Chestnuts and oyster mushrooms with some honeydew.  The flavor is mixed berries with elderberries, blackberries, and floral rice.  The palate is definitely warming, but not overly alcoholic.  Nice drying and juicy palate.  Would possibly go well with yellowtail sushi.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
1629,"2006-02-20",3.0,"Clear pear juice appearance. Fruity, lightly herbal, mild alcohol aroma. Nice fruity flavor, sweet berries, mildly tropical, light in body and dryish alcohol finish. My first sake tasting (non-slamming). Especially surprised by the fruity tones and lack of harsh alcohol. More to follow.","California, USA","BeerLimey"
1629,"2005-12-12",2.8,"300mL Bottle: Clear with just a hint of ivory color. The nose is sweet with koji, strawberry and melon; some alcohol. The flavor is very acidic and dry with a sharp taste of koji and grains. Fairly strong alcohol flavor as well as it warms. It has some distinct american sake notes. The ginjo of America is the futsu-shu of Japan. Finishes creamy and buttery. The tail is about average length with the dryness being accentuated more than anything. This reminds me a lot of the Sho Chiku Bai Premium Ginjo.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
