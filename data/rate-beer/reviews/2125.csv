Unfortunately, we used this one as a sacrificial lamb - a palate cleanser after Stone Crime and Punishment, among other big, crazy beers. Pours a pale bright gold with a white head. Light-bodied with medium carbonation and a mouthfeel that is both dank from fresh hops and dry from the base. Notes of herbs, grass, straw, pale malts, citrus and spice. But if I were to describe this in one line, it would be: like a typical golden/blond ale with hop pellets chucked in. Thats what separates my opinion from DrSilverworms on this - I wouldnt call it an IPA because the base and late hop addition are so clearly separate.

2125,"2014-07-10",4.8,"Date on the 12 oz. can. It pours a golden-tangerine, and has extra fine particulates suspended in it. It makes a very dense, rocky, creamy top on it, probably 2 fingers deep of mousse. For all the different hops used, its aroma is a bit subdued. Its not as aromatic as some IPAs, but would pass for one easily with other brewers, it sure is luscious smelling. Fruity, piney, and very tempting. It is a nicely balanced tasting ale. The hops are noticeable, but dont bite your tongue. The brew has a bitter finish, but it goes down clean and not sticky. The hops do come through overall, and are such an unexpected surprise. When I saw this at the store I did a double take, then my eyes opened and my curiosity fired up. I am so pleased I grabbed a 6 pack of these cans!

2125,"2013-05-24",4.2,"Poured up gold with a really nice head that held on the whole way.  Smells of hops and tastes of hops.  This is like an IPA but for some reason is not labled as such.  Citrus, little pine, small hint at that aluminum from the can.  Just wish I could find this in bottle.  Beginning to think it is not in bottles.","Temple, Texas, USA","dlihcsnatas"
2125,"2013-05-18",3.9,"12 ounce can thanks to errl. Thanks! Pours a clean copper color with a big, fluffy white head of foam. Good retention. Aroma is earthy and herbal. Tastes very clean. The dry hopping really worked wonders here.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
2125,"2013-05-16",3.6,"Can at BTBF. Pours with a clear golden hued body with a white head. Aromas are of hops: grassy, tangerine, citrus and fruity. Very mild malt structure, light fermentation esters. Hops are show cased. Flavors are grassy, tons of dry hop resin character, citrus, herbaceous, tangerine. Grainy and dry. Lively carbonation, low body with a dry and crisp finish. Id definitely pick up a few cans of this if it were locally available and fresh.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
2125,"2013-05-12",3.4,"Can poured a hazy gold with a lingering ring of off white foam. Aromas of straw, tea, grassiness and citrus. Palate was light bodied and crisp.

2125,"2013-05-07",3.6,"Nice orange gold with a bit of lacing.  Some citrus and floral hops on the nose...thinking simcoe dry hopping?  Nice malt core and bitter finish.  Solid canned IPA.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"
2125,"2013-05-06",3.7,"Can poured into a footed pilsner/flute glass. Appearance is a hazy golden yellow color with a frothy white head. Aroma is very bready, evidence of dry-hopping, citrus and grapefruit. Flavor is hoppy, dry and grassy bready. Finishes not very dry on the finish though which gives it a good palate. Much better than the original.

2125,"2013-05-06",4.2,"What a delicious brew this was. I was expecting something a little bigger than regular firemans 4, but this really matches the brewerys commercial description, and then some. Monstrously hoppy and pungent in both aroma and taste, with a bold body and ample carbonation. Highly recommended. My only disappointment is that so far Ive only found it at the brewery. I may have missed what supply of it came to my town until next year. Had I known of its existence I would have sought it out.","Texas, USA","alcaponejunior"

2125,"2013-05-02",3.9,"Now thats more like it. This is a vast improvement on the original, which was very meh. Now this does not act like a blond in many respects. The boquet is one of many hop varieties: citrus, piney, floral. The color looks like a standard golden or blond with a white head. Heavier palate with good carbonation. Taste was more like a pale or IPA. The malt presence provided a nice backbone for the hops, which kept coming. Decent malt note that had some straw flavors, although faint. Great improvement, just not sure how true it is to style.","The Colony, Texas, USA","kevinator"

2125,"2013-04-14",3.8,"Bright golden orange in color with a white head and slow but populous carbonation, this is how Firemans #4 should be. A light. Caramel and fresh, spicy pine hop aroma is just what Firemans #4 was missing and makes for a freaking awesome nose.  In the mouth, hops dominate from intake to finish with a delicious bouquet of varieties, even ending with some heavy bitter flavors that linger for quite a while. The hop flavor is accompanied subtly by notes of light caramel that barely keeps the hop intensity in check. I really like this beer!","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

2125,"2013-04-11",1.8,"Pint glass at DH- served a transparent orange brown color, 2.5 mm white bubbly head formed and tried its best to lace upon the vessel.  Aroma of uncleaned grain silo- like grain that was stored for a year that didnt reach below 30 for dryness (all the farmhands on here will KNOW what that means), left with the door half open on some days, then used.  Yeah, el yummo like earlier.  Hits the mouth with a medium body, malt definately tastes ""uncleaned"", hops in the middle, finish was watery.  Nyet.","Austin, Texas, USA","mmmbeer"

2125,"2012-08-05",3.6,"Cask poured at The Bottle Shop on Greenville. 

The beer pours a golden color with a white head. The aroma has a ton of big orange citrus notes, as well as some biscuit malt. The flavor is very similar. I get quite a bit of sweetness from the biscuit malt, with some toffee also thrown in. However, the hops also really come through. I get some juicy orange notes as well as some grass and resin. The bitterness is low to medium and goes with the flavors very well. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. This is completely different than the regular Firemans 4 and is a definite improvement in my opinion.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
