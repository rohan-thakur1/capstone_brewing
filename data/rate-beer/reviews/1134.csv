1134,"2017-05-14",4.0,"Thnx to david . Pours dark redpurple. Small white head. Smell is super intense fruity. Mildly acidic, oak. Taste is very full, intensely sour, but with a very decent complexity. High carbo. Ok, bit astrigent MF. Sourness is perhaps a bit too high , as this is really vinegar / acidic. Nice beer though.","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"
1134,"2017-02-04",4.3,"750ml bottle pours out a sexy ruby red purple color topped with a pink head. Nose is great jammy raspberry sweetness with a pithy seed tart notes and funk.

1134,"2016-11-02",4.1,"Bright reddish purple pour, fizzy reddish pink head. Bright fresh raspberry, tangy barrel, funky yeast, a little dust. Bright fresh raspberry flavor, nice balanced funk and tanginess. Effervescent carbonation. Love how fresh the berries taste. Solid stuff.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
1134,"2016-07-02",4.4,"The beer is a deep purple. Opaque. Small pink maroon head. Huge raspberry flavor in the aroma. Solid funk. Mild cheesiness. Lots of nice fruitiness against the sour. Jammy, vinous, some nice oak. Lemon tartness mostly from the berries. Taste is fairly tart but not harsh. Very good funk to this beer. Fizzy feel. Probably my favorite Oso beer so far.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

1134,"2016-05-01",4.3,"Poured from a bottle. 
Aroma is full of raspberries with some light citrus notes. Fairly funky with a nice earthy note. Moderate oak notes. 
Pours a deep reddish purple with a small, thick, pink head that recedes quickly and disappears. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor is somewhat sweet with moderate acidity, but not sharp at all. Lots of raspberry flavors, but not too jammy. Moderate funk notes with some nice herbal and earthy notes. Medium light oak notes. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, this is a great beer. So much raspberry with really nice, balanced funk and some oak notes. Acidity is nice and pronounced but not sharp at all. Really great funk. I like that the raspberry notes arent jammy.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
1134,"2016-03-25",3.9,"Bottle share at RBB. Pour is ruby/orange with a minimal white head. Aroma and flavor of raspberry jam, funky sour mash, lemon zest, and dry acidic notes.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Dfonorow"
1134,"2016-03-23",4.4,"750ml pour at the Penrose Technical Tour (Geneva, IL). Thanks Levi! Pours a deep crimson red wine color, big glowing cranberry glow or macerated fresh pulpy raspberries. A good haziness, frothy pinkish ring atop is a nice enough thicker ring that laces nice enough. Deep colors in the body are quite striking. Aromas are potent and sour, wet wood, sour cherries and big raspberry and cranberry appeal, seedy and sour with lactic pop, some seedy appeal, earth and a bit of vanillin. Earth, gentle funk asserts itself a bit more as we let it settle. Jabs of red wine, lush and deep aromas with that deep sour and pulpy raspberry and cranberry appeal. Really nice stuff. Initial is lighter bodied, a touch of body with nice pulpy fruit, raspberries and a bit of cherry. Earthy, a bit tannic and dry as some nice cleaner body as opposed to a fruit bomb or abrasive sour element. Nice fruity presence is light enough to put down easily, nothing holding you down, but also quite punchy, deep and dark. Some nice tannic appeal, an enjoyable funky brett life, subtle barnyard and cobwebs into the backend add some nice complexity. Subtle oak, really on point fruit presence. A bit tannic, good raspberry skin presence as we finish up. Really lovely stuff. Nothing to heavy but still flavorful, fairly complex, every element flowing and working together. A lovely pour and nose, good flavors, great balance. Just lovely.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
1134,"2016-03-14",4.9,"This is the best fruited lambic Ive ever had. Perfectly bright pink/red color and the aroma was extremely satisfying. You can taste the raspberries immediately and it finishes with a subtle dryness. Highly recommend! Thanks for sharing Kraig Jordan!","","LancerUWM"
1134,"2016-03-14",4.9,"This beer is something special. Pours the most beautiful shade of purple that Ive ever seen in a beer. As rich as the color is, youd expect it to be overly fruited, or one dimensional, but its not. Its so complex. The way the fruit highlights the funk instead of masking it is amazing. The juiciest of raspberries and that house funk we have all began to crave. If there is one funk factory beer to seek out, I vote its this. Do yourself a favor and get one!","","Sourcrusher"
1134,"2016-03-14",4.8,"Shout #notalambic all you want, this is another close to perfect attempt by Levi at the lambic style, and is better than most lambics from Belgium aside from the obvious heavy hitters. Id say ""trade for it"" , but good luck getting us WI people to let go of a bottle from an already low bottle count and allotment.

Aroma is rich with deep jammy raspberry, which overpowers the funk youd usually get with a plain lambic. Makes you want to stick your nose in the glass for a few seconds before every taste

Appearance - A beautiful beer. Somewhere between fuchsia and the deep purple of the raspberries. Surprising head retention for the style, wtih some of the color bleeding into the head as well with a good pour.

Taste - Close to perfect as the aroma and appearance, but a little less jammy raspberry flavor (marginally) than the aroma lets on. Rich fruit flavor still takes over in a tart and funky raspberry way as expected, without being overly acidic.

Palate - clean and refreshing. A little on the dry side. light to medium body, with average to soft carbonation.","Wisconsin, USA","CobiiWI"
1134,"2016-03-06",4.4,"Bottle - Pours purple with a filmy tan head. Nose is seedy raspberry, light lemony tartness, a little plastic note, and more sweet jammy fruit. Taste is the same--really jammy with lemony tartness and a quenching acetic finish. Smooth, fluffy carbonation and a soft finish. So, so good.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
1134,"2016-02-28",4.0,"Bottle @ RBWG 2016. Turbid reddish beer with a white head. Tart raspberry and a touch of jam. A bit on the seedy side with some tannic fruit skins. A little bit of funk. Somewhat oaky and has a nice dry, sour finish. Has an almost perfumey floral character to the nose. Pretty juicy. Nice stuff.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

1134,"2016-02-08",4.7,"This stood out among many great Funk Factory and other beers throughout the evening. I really enjoy the balance. There are way too many AWAs that are all about the pucker factor. This isnt one of them. Well done!","","Mark000"
1134,"2016-02-07",4.7,"After sitting down with a few of their bottles, Im blown away by what these guys are doing. Full fruit flavor on a bed of funk with a nice dry finish. Truly an outstanding beer that could compete with the best Belgian versions.","","beerandbourbon"

1134,"2015-12-20",4.2,"750 ml bottle shared by Chris at Marks gigantic tasting. Thanks again, Chris! This was one of the closers for the evening for me, and it was a worthy nightcap. Pours a deep, hazy ruby color with minimal head that vanishes pretty quickly. Lovely shade. Big, rich, dark raspberries, with deep florals, cherry, funk, lemon, and oak. The berries suggest both pie and jam here. Light-medium bodied, with moderate to medium carbonation and a fruity, earthy mouthfeel. Quite lovely. Best Funk Factory offering Ive had yet.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
