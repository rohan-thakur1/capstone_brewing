257,"2012-11-17",4.0,"2012 Colorado Mead Tasting at Armins house. Thanks to Steve_0 for sharing his wedding rarity. Mikey loves it, so Ima gonna love it! Disclaimer: I know nothing about sake, so this is a rating from an amateur. Pours a very light, just a touch yellowish appearance with no head. Pear, light banana, a bit spicy, but pretty interesting aroma. A bit spicy, somewhat boozy, chewy sweet rice, sweet apple flavor with the booze having a nice prickly feel on the tongue. Maybe the best sake Ive had and kind of makes me want to try some more.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"

Pear, sweet rice, white wine, somewhat husky, lacto, and cantaloupe in the aroma. Honeydew,  pear juice, a touch of banana, apples, and biscuit with a light alcoholic burn on the finish; super dry. Slick body with no carbonation. Pretty nice Sake.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
