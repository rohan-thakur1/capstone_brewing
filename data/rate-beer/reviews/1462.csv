1462,"2016-12-29",4.2,"Apparence : Presque noire au versement, beau col très foncé, crémeux, bonne rétention, légère dentelle. 
Nez : Dabord, les grains rôtis. Par la suite, on rajoute de la vanille, des notes de chocolat et de café. 
Goût : Chocolat, vanille, malt grillé, alcool, sucre brûlé. Pratiquement toutes les notes du fut de bourbon qui partent et reviennent allégrement. 
Sensation : Corps moyen-plus, crémeuse, léger piquant, belle chaleur en gorge. 
Bref : Tout est joué dans léquilibre, rien dans lexcès. Cette bière est excessivement marquée par ce que le fut de bourbon apporte habituellement à une Stout : du chocolat, de la vanille, un caramel bien grillé, un côté boisé coupant dans le sucre résiduel; beaucoup moins par ses additifs, soit le café et le miel. Cest bon, cest intense, jamais trop sucré. Très belle surprise après la mini déception quavait représenté la Twilight of the Idols. Défaut?

Au nez, on dénote un côté sucré, avec du sucre dorge notamment, de même que laspect torréfié du café utilisé pour brasser la bière. En bouche, on a vraiment limpression davoir affaire avec une bière bien complexe. On remarque dabord le café, avec son goût torréfié mais pas trop intense. Ensuite, on note les goûts plus classiques de la porter avec mélasse et sucre dorge. Enfin le côté plus boisé est présent, avec une impression de sirop dérable intéressante que lon associe au bourbon. Bref, une bière complexe, bien faite.

1462,"2016-11-03",4.2,"2015 bottle, if I remember correctly, drunk 10/21/16, thanks to Nelson.Deep, dark, impenetrable ebony body is topped by a medium-sized, tan head showing strong retention.Much less spice comes through in this than Twilight, which is good as I thought last years batch of that was overspiced, not terribly so, but still somewhat. Low on the barrel aging with no big oakiness and predominantly spicy bourbon notes without any sharp, boozy edges. What it certainly does have is malt. Lots of it. Rich, fudgey malts are full and aromatic with roasted barley acidity helping to balance. Light soy, maple and chalky, yeast notes with vanilla and fudge lingering.Rich, velvety and sweet, it has low but tight carbonation and low spicing. The bourbon adds spicy liquor notes which help offset this huge maltiness. Furthermore, the finish is full of roasted acidity, creating luxurious coffee flavors and balancing the beer. It still tends sweet, of course, but importantly doesnt seem in the least bit syrupy or cloying, and Im very sensitive to too much sweetness.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1462,"2016-10-08",4.2,"(On tap @ Warpigs HF Day, Copenhagen, May 12 2016) Pours pitch black with a pale tan head and light lace. Aroma is rich with fairly heavily roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, bourbon, toasted coconut, spicy undertones, some oak, hint of booze. Flavour is rather concentrated and sweet to begin, dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon, dried fruit, cinnamon, vanilla, toffee, rather roasted, drying towards the finish with woody notes, bitter coffee and deep roast more apparent, a touch earthy with alcohol warmth. Full bodied and silky with low carbonation.

Pours a night black color, with a decent beige head, which collapses to formable swirls of lacing, coating up the side of the glass.

Consists of a nose, which comes beautifully together, defined by earthy coffee, toffee malts, coconut and oaky, warm Bourbon. All the different aromas stand out on their own, while blending flawlessly together, with wild honey on top, adding a glazed, sweet aspect to the mix. Bourbon is certainly noteable, while not over the top at all, accentuating the other aspects of the beer.

Drinks amazingly smooth and fairly easy, based on its actual abv, while its lower carbonation opens up the palate to sweet honey very effectivly. Doesnt have a thick mouthfeel as bcbs, while it drinks almost smoother.

There is toffee, earthy, bitter coffee, gently wrapped up by wood embraced Bourbon, coconut and wild honey to complete the taste. I am honestly blown away by the outstanding balance of this, while every flavor is easily recognizable on its own, they all seem to benefit from each other, by enhancing each others appearance on the palate. The Bourbon provides a pleasant warmth during the beers finish, easily balanced by slick honey, producing a melting caramel, glazed sugar impression, adding to the toffee, creating the most enjoyable, natural sweetness you could ever wish for.

A real treat, much more than I expected it to be. The flavors come beautifully together, tied together by a balance and smoothness which almost puts Bourbon County to shame, and that at a considerable lower abv. Honey and Bourbon create a incredibly synergy, making up for the lack of roastieness by providing the most enjoyable sweetness I experienced in a beer so far, which makes this perfect for a cold winter night, as well as for every other night in which you want to drink an exeptional beer.","GERMANY","aleigator"

 Heavy. Viscous for a porter, although thats arguable. Very low carbonation.

1462,"2015-04-23",3.8,"Merci à SlovakSniper pour avoir partagé ce moment de dégustation avec moi. Bière bien noire affichant un collet qui ma surpris pour une bière de ce type. En effet, un fort collet sombre de grosses bulles sest rapidement formé en surface de ce liquide noir mais sa durée de vie fut toutefois courte. Nempêche, tant la mousse que la pré-mousse (jappelle ainsi les fines bulles situées sous la mousse principale qui collent aux parois du verre) annonçaient un liquide riche et onctueux, Nez léger. Surprise! Même en plongeant agressivement mon nez au fond de mon verre (petit verre étroit et plutôt long destiné à la dégustation des vins de porto) je ne détectais pas les arômes complexes que je mattendais à y trouver. Le bois certes, le café (bien entendu) et quelques fruits et des violettes de sus-bois. En se réchauffant par contre, le liquide gagnait du nez. De chaudes vapeurs dalcool et de fruits rouges émanaient de mon verre. en bouche, le tout était très léger et agréable. Encore une surprise. La rondeur anticipée nétais pas au rendez-vous. Bière à la texture très soyeuse et souple, mais de corps moyen. Des flaveurs de vanille, de prune et de fraises. De durée moyenne en bouche et dune texture dune grande délicatesse, cette bière est fort agréable mais nest pas à mon avis une Grande parmi les Grandes.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
1462,"2015-04-23",3.7,"Merci à Youri pour lhospitalité et pour la dégustation! Vintage 2015. Au versement, le corps brun très foncé est entouré dune lumière pourpre. La tête mousseuse est bien belle au départ mais tombe assez rapidement. Je ne vois pas de dentelle sur mon verre. Au nez, le bourbon est caramélisé, vanillé et teinté par la noix de coco. Tout est bien (ou trop) doux et un peu éloigné de ce que je mattends ordinairement dun porter impérial. En fait, les parfums sont riches et annoncent beaucoup de sucre en bouche. Sur les papilles, je décèle rapidement des saveurs de bois brûlé (lintérieur du fût de bourbon). Les sucres annoncés ne sont pas tant au rendez-vous : la douceur est contenue par leau-de-vie. En se tempérant, par contre, tout devient un peu plus collant. En bouche, le liquide est bien soyeux. Les bulles sont modérées à faibles. La finale est de plus en plus chaude et aussi assez douce : le sucre des dernières gorgées se loge aux commissures de mes lèvres. Tout compte fait, beau nez riche mais moyennement complexe et saveurs un peu obnubilées par le caractère noirci du fût. Ceci dit, bon porter impérial qui nest certainement pas, en ce qui me concerne, fabuleux.

1462,"2014-06-19",4.3,"Bottled 10/2013. 
Aroma has moderate chocolate and medium light honey notes with some light roast. Some dark fruit esters, sweet berries and plums. Medium light coffee notes with some nuttiness and toffee. Light alcohol spice and bourbon notes. 
Pours black with a medium small, fairly thick mocha head with some reddish hues. Head recedes fairly quickly to the edges. Light lacing and fairly long legs. 
Flavor has some moderate sweetness with quite a bit of chocolate character. Moderate honey notes and light roast character. Moderate sweet berry, cherry and plum notes. Medium light bourbon and oak notes - both are fairly prevalent but not hot at all. Very light coffee character. Medium light bitterness with a touch of alcohol in the finish. Some toffee and caramel as it warms along with a touch more roast. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium carbonation and a somewhat silky mouthfeel that ends with some stickiness. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, an amazingly enjoyable porter with some great complexity. The really impressive thing for me is how the bourbon and oak notes interact without being too hot. The coffee notes are somewhat muted, but add some slight complexity without dominating. Honey adds a good character that works well with the bourbon notes.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Dark brown, flat appearing beer. Smells decadent: vanilla, oak, nougat, more vanilla, bits of graham, some cocoa, a hint of dark fruits. A really nice nose. Flavor follows suite - really fine dark chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, bits of minced licorice, some leather. The flavor is really nice also. Mouthfeel: this is where the beer falls apart.

A: Pours an opaque deep brown color with some clearer edges. A thin tan head forms on the pour and recedes quickly to a thin ring. A few splotches of lace are left down the glass.

S: Smooth bourbon up front with a ton of fudge. Heavily roasted malts with a light chocolate sweetness. Besides the smoothness and lightness of the bourbon the barrel isnt all that noticeable. 

T: The taste just took on a complexity that wasnt found in the nose. The smoothness of the bourbon carried over and blended wonderfully with some ground coffee beans and espresso notes. The bourbon took a sweeter turn mid palate and balanced the heavy roasted malt body. A little oak barrel shows up and blend nicely with a rich and lush chocolate on the finish.

M: Low carbonation here with a medium to light body. For hour luscious the taste was I would have liked a little more body to this.

O: Absolutely delicious. I like Twilight of the Idols, but I like this even more. If they would beef up the gravity a bit I bet this would be able to hold onto the barrel a little better and get a better mouthfeel. Still, Im just nitpicking here. A great beer.

Vanilla bean and cinnamon in the background. Complex dark fruit notes - much like caramel soaked dried figs as well as vanilla fudge. No unpleasant burnt notes or anything - I couldn't really imagine that this aroma could be improved. The taste showcases an amazingly complex malt bill - chocolate, dark caramel, dark fruit, some roasted bitterness. Bourbon provides huge vanilla presence, cinnamon is somewhere in the mix, too. A lovely coffee note in the finish, very fruity and only slightly bitter, accentuated by a restrained hoppiness. This is the ultimate winter beer to enjoy on this evening of one of the first really cold days. It's sweet without being cloying, bourbonesque without being alcoholic.

A - Deep dark brown to black. Amber hues against the light. Looks like milk chocolate. No head, almost no carbonation. Decent alcohol legs for an 11% beer with no lacing (probably due to age?)

1462,"2012-05-15",3.5,"From notes.  Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a snifter.

Birth of Tragedy pours a mahogany, nearly black color with a small tan mocha cap.  

Lots of espresso, somewhat bitter and a bit creamy, dark bitter chocolate, sweet milk chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of spicy hops in the nose.  

The flavor is full of a ton of espresso, a bit of cream, dark, bitter chocolate, deeply roasted malt, and a bit of spice toward the finish.  There is a sweetness to some of chocolate notes, but overall it is fairly bitter.  There is not very much bourbon character coming through.

The mouthfeel is fairly full, there is a creamy carbonation.  It is a bit acrid in its bitterness, with a dryness toward the end.  Even without the bourbon flavor coming through, it feels like the dryness from the oak barrel came through fairly strongly.

 It was fairly nice, but I really noticed the acrid nature of it, which detracted from the experience.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

1462,"2012-03-26",3.6,"500ml bottle.  The pour yields a dark and dense, inky-looking mahogany body with a very short head of bubbly mocha froth.  Lacing is limited to a few micro-spots that escape the viscous sheeting that briefly stains the glass.  Once warm, the nose reveals a rich malt base of dark chocolate, caramel, stewed plums and rummy raisins.  It smells very fruit forward, with figs and dates also joining the fold.  Faded coffee lends just a bit of earthiness, while distant juniper-like spicing and perhaps a wisp of spruce tend to brighten things up a bit.  Its boozy, with notes of vanilla laden bourbon and maybe some mead-like fermented honey qualities.  The flavor is pulled together well, loaded with bittersweet dark chocolate, muddled dark fruits, and perhaps some earthen tobacco.  Coffee asserts itself a good deal more than the nose lets on, working along the green hop elements to add a rustic bitterness.  Burnt honey again creeps in on the back end, as does warming, heavily-wooded bourbon.  As expected, the palate is dense and boozy, lacking a bit in carbonation and missing out on some liveliness.  The finish is long, biting, and bittersweet.  Overall, its a solid brew, but it comes across overly syrupy and hot for my tastes.  Definitely a slow sipper to be split between a few folks.  Not Hill Farmsteads best effort.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Usually at the long drawn out beer tastings, the beers that get opened towards the end tend to lose their edge and are less memorable for me. Wow did this one change my mind about that.  Pour is deep, dark , cloudy brown with a small off-white head.  Aroma and flavor are loaded with deep roasty malt, faint raisins, faint earthy spice, a touch of hay and a smooth rounded coffee note. This beer is so smooth and so well balanced. Again, I do love this brewery. Not sure if its their yeast, their style, or what.

1462,"2012-02-20",4.1,"In short: A not-too-bourbonny BA coffee stout with a soft spiciness.  Excellent.
How: Super-fresh tap at the brewery + bottle age 2 months
The look: Black body topped by a small tan head
In long: Nose is only moderately bourbonny over a rich dark maltiness with notes of vanilla and coffee beans.  Taste is relatively smooth for a 11% BA big beer, round and smooth full body, coffee, vanilla beans, cookies, black chocolate, dark caramel, delicate spiciness, very light vinous notes.  Alcohol is extremely well hidden.  Basically this beer offers the standard elements you expect from a bourbon barrel aged coffee stout, but it doesnt overdo the barrel aspect, adds a soft candy spiciness, and more importantly the beer is relatively easy to drink.  I cant say I agree with the ratings that are making this beer almost the best Hill Farmstead beer, to me this is an average Hill Farmstead offering, which means it is only excellent.  But this is ratebeer and this is a big barrel aged black beer, so Anyway, it is not easy to get up very early on a Saturday morning, drive a long distance to a beer release and stand in line outside in the cold just to get a rare beer, but bragging about it to strangers on the internet makes it all worthwhile.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

1462,"2012-01-20",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 27, 2015 My Bottom Line :  
Coffee beans, biscuity cereals and dark chocolate ground this Barrel-Aged Imperial Coffee Porters relatively subtle bourbon vanilla, as spicy nuances construct an even more tantalizing finish.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A slice of foam floats atop the darkness.
-The spiciness could be mistaken for clove-like phenolics; its that well integrated to the rest of the flavor profile. 
-Light alcohol burn reminds you this is a powerful brew while never bothering the flavor profile. 
-The mouthfeel is once again rich and amazingly soft.
-Cinnamon sticks are imagined in the finish, alongside the chocolate and coffee lengths.

Taste is whiskey, coffee, vanilla.  Slightly too much whiskey, I think, but not bad. Cant tell it apart from an imperial stout.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
1462,"2011-12-24",3.9,"Thanks Lee .. . Pours as dark as the inside of a well diggers ass .. . light foam .. . rich tar, dark roast, dark vanilla, coffee grounds, and nighttime .. . pretty damn nice .. . . . When I was a kid my favorite relative was Uncle Caveman. After school wed all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he would eat one of us. It wasnt until later that I found out that Uncle Caveman was a bear.",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"
1462,"2011-12-23",4.0,"500ml bottle again thanks to Wallace... Pours a deep oily stouty black hue with burnt reddish edges and a wispy tan head... Aroma has a bunch of complexity with an inky iodine nature to it, almost smoky with some supplemented sweet honey and vanilla... Flavors are on point with a barrel  essence of light iodine and woody barrel characteristics. Sweet throughout but not overwhelmingly so. Body goes quite well with the style and substance if the brew with a soft to medium level of carbonation. A touch of whiskey heat on the backend which doesnt detract but adds character. Solid with a lot of added.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
1462,"2011-12-22",3.7,"bottle... light black with a light tan head that is gone almost right away... the aroma is several aromas rounded into sweet note, light coffee, molasses, black licorice, and lots of bourbon... initially this just tastes like a blended batch of several bourbons, as it warms a really sweet and syrupy chocolate emerges, molasses, chocolate cake, smooth bourbon finish... really solid","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
1462,"2011-12-21",4.2,"Bottle This beer rocks! Dark brown ale with no head. The aroma is a super complex mélange of bourbon, dark chocolate, cinnamon, wildflower honey and loads of deeply roasted coffee. Full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and pillow-soft carbonation. The flavor is of sweet chocolate-covered black cherries, pronounced mocha and a gentle note of vanilla. Roasty, sweet, chocolate-drenched fruit finish. Big-time thanks to biggsbowler for sharing this rare treat!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1462,"2011-12-20",4.3,"Bottle shared by biggsbowler.  Dark brown pour with no head.  Coco puffs and winter spice aromas.  Not too thick with good lacing.  Smooth and delicious with coffee, honey, coco, dark roasted malt, and caramel notes.  Well done.....","Florida, USA","50belair"
1462,"2011-12-16",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 17, 2011 (22oz bottle courtesy of dak).  Pours near black with thin espresso head. Aroma is heavy vegetal, chocolate, light bourbon.  Taste is sweet malts with chocolate and caramel.  Full bodied with oily texture.  Alcohol heat. Good.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","dcschiller"
1462,"2011-12-16",4.4,"Finally. Mostly black. Small tannish head. Aroma of smoke, spice, toasty malt, molasses. Flavor has loads of roast, molasses, smoke, charred oak. Wonderful.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
1462,"2011-12-10",4.1,"Pour is pretty dark. Tan head, not super dense. Aroma is chocolate, cinnamon and vanilla. Very rich and warming. Maybe a hint of hazelnut. Really inviting and complex. Great. I definitely get the spices in the taste, gives it a little bit of a Christmas hot chocolate feel. Its almost like a hot chocolate coffee blend, which I happen to drink a lot and thus really like. There is a bit of chocolate and some booziness on the finish, but nothing harsh or biting. Very nice. Mouthfeel could be a bit better, but overall this is delicious.","Oceanside, California, USA","biggirlpanties"
1462,"2011-12-10",4.4,"500mL thanks to oteyj. Pours near ink, very black SRM generating a surprisingly fizzy, reddish tan head settling to a thin cappuccino froth. Sticky, webby tan lace. Nose is interesting. Sharp vanilla bean and ancho/guajillo chili pepper dark chocolate sprinkled with turbinado sugar. Wow. Soft bourbon spice. Subtle yet fantastic nose- must allow it to decant a little bit. Morphs to melted dark chocolate bar. Taste....wow. Very silky, soft, almost like drinking super dark chocolate milkshake. Wild palate. Hilariously soft- almost impossibly soft. Muted bourbon spice, buttery dark chocolate ganache, true French truffles melting. In the finish is mild barrel character. Palate is 6/5. I can see all those people at Dark Lord Day pooping in Port-A-Potties and reeking of BO waiting for 8 hours to try a beer that they think will taste like Hill Farmstead Birth of Tragedy, but sadly is Dark Lord. A 3.8 level imperial stout at best that trembles in the presence of this behemoth, which is devastating not only in aesthetics and taste but also in subtlety and softness. What a magical experience. I will say one thing: DO NOT AGE!! You will be wildly disappointed. This baby is good to go.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
1462,"2011-12-09",4.3,"tried this multiple times now, bottles courtesy of shaun and ernesto. terrific bourbon importer, well rounded, lots of bourbon highlighted here very nicely. a bit sticky in the back palate, slightly bitter aftertaste shows up too, slightly drying. makes you want another fresh sip for the sweet bourbon profile. overall a very nice brew, a year or two on it may help a bit.","Notown, California, USA","wavers1"
1462,"2011-12-02",4.4,"Outstanding beer.  Pours a silky smooth luxurious black pour with moderate to low carbonation.  Aroma is toasted vanilla, bourbon, roasted malts, bakers chocolate, and spices.  The taste is wonderful and I cant think of a better beer to be described as a winter beer.  Tons of bourbon and barrel character, almost too much.  Winner winner chicken dinner.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
1462,"2011-11-28",4.7,"HUGE thanks to the man oteyj for picking up this gem!!! Thick black pour with a frothy, cask-like tan head. Nose is absolutely mindblowing, with epic notes of vanilla, dark cherry, uber rich chocolate ganache, mocha, and superb clove and cinnamon hidden in the depths. Further notes of dark rum, dark molasses and true New England maple syrup with that strong and genuine bark and nuanced sweetness. Both ends of the bourbon gamut also shine through; spicy rye and smooth wheat presence. Truly superb aroma. 



The flavor, if possible, might be better than the nose. The whiskey barrel comes through with even further vanilla extract, wood, spice, caramel, maple sap, chocolate truffle, smooth white chocolate latte, and even a touch of citrus, much like a chocolate orange. The mocha and lactic cream presence doesnt contribute any bitterness or roast, but just a supremely balanced, complex, and intricate sweetness. The barrel aging yields a creamier, richer, and smoother than most of Shauns beers; that crisp effervescence that marks most of Hill Farmsteads saisons, IPAs, and even his darker beers is replaced by a luxurious, smooth, wave-like texture that glides across the roof of the mouth, tongue, teeth, and gums with remarkable ease. The 11% ABV hardly shows, though there is a whisper of its presence, enough to make the fortitude of this beer felt in the deep reaches of the consumers mind. I am truly blown away. A marvel in the world of beer.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
1462,"2011-11-27",4.2,"Thanks to a generous trading partner for sending this bottle. I wanted to share this but its my birthday and I wants it. 

Pours pitch black and completely opaque with a thin mocha head that immediately fades into a thin ring. Not much in the way of lacing. 

Huge malt aroma thats bursting with roasted gourmet coffee, luscious chocolate and a strong barrel presence. Some prominent toasted oak along with sweet bourbon and vanilla notes followed by dark chocolate, oatmeal, coffee bean, dark fruit and toast. Complex and although the bourbon is strong, it doesnt overpower the other notes. 

Slightly viscous mouthfeel with a really nice balance of bourbon barrel, molasses, luscious chocolate, dark fruit and boozy heat. Really well balanced even though there is quite a bit of bourbon flavor. Dry toasted oak along with some sweet vanilla flavor and tons of delicious, sweet bourbon. Underneath, there is a nice molasses character that adds fullness to the palate along with a strong dark malt presence. Bittersweet dark chocolate complimented by a slightly roasted, incredibly smooth coffee flavor that never becomes acrid, astringent or harsh. Theres a decent amount of boozy heat in the finish but overall the high ABV is very well masked. 

Overall this beer is complex, well balanced and extremely flavorful. Its refreshing to find a beer like this that isnt a complete bourbon bomb. Recommended!","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
1462,"2011-11-27",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 27, 2012 This is the best bourbon barrel aging Ive ever had. Huge complex bourbon flavors perfectly marries vanilla, roasted malts, with a long bourbon dry finish. Grand fuckin slam.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
1462,"2011-11-26",3.2,"50cl bottle poured into a standard geuze tumbler. Inky black with a thin burgundy head. Nose is quite sweet...honey, black strap, dark fruits, a little barrel character. Taste mirrors the nose, coming off as overly sweet. Lots of residual sugars here. Notes of dark fruit, turbonado sugar, roasted malts, and slight oxidation. Not bad, but I would have liked to recognize more barrel character and roasted malts.","Mount Misery, Valley Forge, ","LIVEFAST"
1462,"2011-11-21",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 1, 2012 tap at the brewery.   a bit hot at the moment.    potent oaky bourbon whiskey, vanilla, backed by some dark fruits, and milk chocolate. bourbon dominated all the nice, complex clean character of twilight.  prefer twilight of the idols, but this might improve with a touch of age as the barrel notes are a bit aggressive at the moment.       still pretty tasty though.   definitely not bad.   just preferred the twilight i had for breakfast this morning.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
1462,"2011-11-21",4.9,"UPDATED: NOV 28, 2011 On tap at HFS. This is without a doubt, one of the best barrel aged beers Ive ever had. Black and filthy pour with a medium sized tan head, that despite months of barrel aging, has excellent retention. The nose is out of control: vanilla bourbon, whiskey, milky chocolate, bakers chocolate, cocoa nib, brownies, caramel, back strap molasses, and subtle roast. The ethanol presence makes for a very hot beer, but it was just what the doctor ordered when I was standing in the cold outside the brewery. Palate is rich and thick- silky and supple with affirming booze and a desert like finish.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"
1462,"2011-11-21",4.2,"Bottle 50 cl. Courtesy of yespr. Pours an opaque black with a small, rough beige head. Soft and smooth yet intense Bourbony oak in the nose atop a layer of subtle roasted malt. Full-bodied with a soft carbonation, sweet roast, sweet licorice, plenty of vanilla and dried dark fruits - heavy on the dates and prunes. Again soft and pleasant Bourbon accents and a fairly warming alcohol in the finish without ever getting boozy. Very pleasant, very elegant. 161111","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"
1462,"2011-11-21",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2012 Served into a globe snifter at HFS. Pours a pitch black liquid and looks fairly viscous. only a few bubbles but no head forms. Smell begins with a rich chocolate roasty malt and coffee with lots of bourbon character, seeping with vanilla resins and a mild note of spice, cinnamon perhaps but not very distinguishable. Taste is a rich dark chocolate malt mocha with sweet vanilla notes and plenty of bourbon character. the spice notes are subtle and pleasant. spice notes open up as the liquid warms with the glass in my palm. Mouthfeel is full body rich feel with low carbonation that allows one to explore the flavors packed within. A touch of alcohol on the nose, not so much in taste and light  alcohol in the feel. Overall a rich flavorful beer that is wholly satisfying.","New Jersey, USA","fbm115"
1462,"2011-11-19",4.8,"So sick.  On tap at the release for it.  Pours out a wonderful lush dark brown with bubbly coffee head.  Boozy aromas of vanilla and bourbon scream out the nose, sweetness abound.  Palate is light and fluffy, bourbon on the backshot, rich creamy textures up front and the abv is hidden so well.  Absolutely amazing, a new favorite.","South Hadley, Massachusetts, USA","cakanator"
