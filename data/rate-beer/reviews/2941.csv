2941,"2016-10-14",3.6,"Aromas are apple and cherry. 

Color is a lovely ruby red with a small off-white head.

Taste is semi-sweet.

Finish is fairly long; it starts with the semi-sweet cherry/apple and ends with the apple aroma.

Overall I like the apple/cherry blend, though it may be just a bit too sweet and is fairly simple.","Michigan, USA","smroush"
