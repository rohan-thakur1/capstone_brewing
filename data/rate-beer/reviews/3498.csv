3498,"2013-08-05",4.0,"On cask at the Old Silk Mill (Derby)

This was a special festival beer on cask in late July. Looking at the ratings before I ordered I knew it would be worth a half pint. The results did not disappoint - this might be one of the best milds and proof that not everything ""mild"" has to be a watery 3.6% mess.

Aroma / Appearance - The deep black base keeps a rosy red edge like flat cola. Plums, chocolate, truffles, and dry black coffee share the stage like a team of well coordinated actors.

Flavor / Palate - The melted chocolate texture is rich with flavors. Starting with red licorice a wave of bittersweet tea and malts carry into the smooth velvety finish. This is a bit like a light dessert in a glass. If youve only got time to try to one mild in the UK this one would be worth it.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3498,"2012-05-02",4.1,"Aug 2006 with updates:I am very lucky because I have only drank this beer at the Beacon Hotel (The brewery) or at CAMRA beer fests.

It obviously doesnt travel to well, according to some reports on here, which is a great shame, because kept well and drank out of a pint pot it is wonderful.

Dark Ruby Brown in colour, as its name suggests, no head should be fully formed, just a whisper or two of white froth which soon disappears as you take great gulps of the beer.

The aroma is so complexed, it fills your brain with an overload of pulses, mine being unable to unscramble them to discribe each beery one.

The taste is heavy, and again complexed and diverse in flavours, all the tastes linger, fruits, malts, hops all blended into a huge explosion of what a great British Strong Mild should be like.

Throw your bottles away and try and visit the Brewery in Sedgley.

There is a slight prickle of dry hop resins in the very brief aftertaste but fades fast. Finish is thick, chewy and very heavy with dry port fruit and vinous oak notes booming in the mouth.

Anyway, the beer. Appearance: Ruby red in colour, with a good fluffy off-white head. Aroma: There is a clear fruitiness in the aroma, definitely blackcurrants, and other berries. An underlying roasted maltiness is present, along with slightly sweet toffee-like scent. Taste: Blackberries, and other dark fruits are very prominent at the start. There is a sweet maltiness after the fruits, which provide a mild biscuitiness. The finish is ever so slightly bitter, with a very noticeable taste of alcohol. Mouthfeel: Medium in the body, with no carbonation. Quite sweet and tart feel. Drinkability: This is a beer that I have been wanting to try for a long time and I wasnt disappointed when I finally got chance to. At 6% ABV, this is strong for a mild but it works well. Its very drinkable, and it is easy to see how it has gained such a good reputation.","Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","PartyBear"

Poured by a very pleasant lady about the right age to be my mother, who asked me if I had tried this ale before, and when I said no, told me this was a great choice. I love how normal and wide-reaching the love of good ales is here in England. It seems like in the US there is a much narrower demographic. Maybe it has to do with the American beer culture being comparatively so much newer. To the beer. Deep carmel color--along the lines of a doppelbock, light tan soapy head. A small touch of sulfur to the aroma, not enough to be really off-putting, but still...a little distracting. Chocolate, clove and bananas. The flavor makes me think of creme brulee--a soft cool sweetness, given depth and piquancy by a deeply caramelized flavor.

Intense fruity, English yeast character.  Apple fades to caramel apple as it warms; a bit vinous as well but only hints.  Light leathery and horse blanket aromas come through.   Flavor is malty and lightly sour.  Surprising since I thought that milds were not supposed to be.  Sourness seems slightly lactic, not dark grain induced, a little disappointing.  Balance is to lightly malty and dry from sourness, not from hops.  Light sherry flavor, followed by a light baryardy flavor.  I think this is infected with Brett!  Ive had this before and I dont remember this being there.  Light hop flavor as well with a dry lightly sour finish, aftertaste is sherry.  Carbonation is high for a mild, body is light but not unusually light given the style, but the overall m/f is way too dry for style IMHO.

3498,"2003-07-15",4.1,"Cask Conditioned at The Beacon Hotel, Sedgeley. Deep brown colour, winey nose with grape quality on the palate. Very rich for a mild, a full spicey acidic flavour. Great stuff.","Banbury, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","imdownthepub"

3498,"2003-03-07",3.1,"Deep reddish-brown, purple.  A bit of sourness in the nose, but notes of grapes and alcohol.  Vinegar on my tongue, but a more relaxed and ale-like aftertaste.  Too sour too soon for me!","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
3498,"2003-03-03",3.6,"Cask at the RAF. Dark brown color.  Really thought this tasted like a thinner red wine.  Same type of darkish grape, plum, fruit with a bit of sour/bitter to round it out.  Fairly good.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"
3498,"2003-03-03",3.7,"Cask at RAF. I can't imagine a mild ale with more flavor, although this ale is hardly mild at 58 OG. Esters and diacetyl are prominent but they lend a lot of flavor to this brittish classic.","Lewis Center, Ohio, USA","tkaufman"
3498,"2003-03-02",3.8,"Cask at RAF.  This is what I imagine a good cask ale is like in some neighborhood pub in the UK.  Dark ruby color (surprize) that was spectacularly clear.  Malty, dry grains, sweet dark fruit, and just a touch of hops in the finish.  A standout at the fest, at least for me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

3498,"2003-02-05",2.4,"This is one weird beer. First it overflowed the glass I poured it into...no, it exploded like a volcano while overflowing. Lots of bubble with this one. Light fruit smell. Taste starts off decent, with a taste of plums and raisins, then falls apart. There is a sour taste on the finish like wine gone bad. Not again for this guy.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","proc"

3498,"2002-12-18",4.0,"Had this on cask a while back.  I like most of these traditional ""working class"" british styles, and this is no exception.  Very dark red-brown, with little head.  Way more complex than i was expecting, very smooth and creamy, with a bit of roasted malts in the finish.  Hops are light and unobtrusive.  Id love to try this bottled, but havent seen it anywhere.","Connecticut, USA","UnionMade"
3498,"2002-11-24",3.0,"Very dark brown with virtually no head.  Sweet and sour malt aroma.  The body is very thin and watery.  Some oaky and fruity notes, but nothing really shows up until the finish when it sours almost like a Flanders red and ends with a weak distant flavor of roasted malt about ten seconds after swallowing.  Not really worth the price, but an interesting style nonetheless.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3498,"2002-10-15",3.1,"Bottle conditioned. Deep ruby red colour, poor head and a low but fine condition. Little apparent yeast in the bottle. Fruity nose with hints of roast malts.

Finish is soft malty sweet with a hint of oakiness and little apparent alcohol.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"

3498,"2002-10-03",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2003  Bottle. An adorable old lady. Deep, dark, delicious and just bursting with heady, fruity, complex flavours. Mild beers are designed to be refreshing - therefore they have a light body and almost no hop bitterness. The alcohol is normally low, but can be high if it is used to enhance the complex malt body rather than give an alcohol kick - this mild does just that. This is a splendid example of a classic English mild. This is a brilliant beer in its own right. Dark Ruby? Damn right! [4.2]   Re-rate.   Gravity Cask, Kent Beer Festival, with Duff & Nuffield.  Muddy brown colour. Sweet up front followed by a complex journey of leather, rancid bacon, wood, red wine, all sorts of stuff. [4.2]","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

Medium malt flavors clouded by what impinges on infected sour/medicinal qualities.  Thin mouthfeel.  May be an old bottle.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
3498,"2002-10-02",2.6,"Deep red color, no head. Near wine like taste, vinous with a touch of fruitiness. Tastes more like wine than beer, Not very malty or hoppy. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
3498,"2002-09-07",3.4,"Not really dark ruby. Looks more black but really dark brown. Good aroma, ginger, some coffee, raisin, a little caramel. Taste is odd. Its sour. It didnt smell like it had gone bad, and it almost tasted like it was supposed to be that way. I actually checked the other ratings to make sure my experience fit before rating to make sure I didnt just get a bad bottle. Odd.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
3498,"2002-08-29",3.6,"This was unique. I dont know if mild is the word they should use with this beer. Dark red and brown mix, colorwise. Smells of fruits or flowers. Tastes more of fruit however and finishes with a sour or bitter note kind of like a granny smith apple or bitter apple. Not bad but not great either. Worth a try.","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"

3498,"2002-08-05",3.4,"This is an interesting English ale with a good head, a dark reddish-brown color, and a flavor rather surprisingly like plum or grape juice with a touch of grapefruit.

3498,"2002-07-11",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2003 Sarah Hughes is like a lot of women I met when I was single--interesting character but not much of a body.  The aroma and flavor here are engaging--sweet roasted malts, raisins, plums, fortified wine (port), with hints of some more traditional strong ales and porters, including a smokey note.  But it looks and feels like a competitor to Coca-Cola.  I got thin to little head, large bubbles of cola-like carbonation, a thin texture, slippery (sugary) consistency.  At 6% this should be more robust.  UK bottles are 500ml, US smaller.  At 6%, this should be more robust in texture.  Sarah Hughes is a woman who I would call 'a good friend' but not somebody I would look to settle down with. (original rating: 8-3-7-2-13).  Re-rate (July 2003):  so many things going on here, sweet, woody, musty, fruity, raspberry.  Slightly light palate but complex, interesting, and very drinkable.

3498,"2002-06-19",3.0,"Okay people, I pour this beer and it poured out a very dark color. But I got none of the head that has been mentioned. My fave spot just got this from their distributor last week. Dont know if it is an old bottle. Little if any head and no lace. The aroma reminded me more of a wine than of a beer. The flavor had an overiding sour taste to it. Which once again begs the question, are they trying to emulate a wine quality. I am a sucker for anything that says dark, but this beer is unusual.","Ohio, USA","Gunshy"

3498,"2001-07-19",4.3,"Ruby my butt - this is near pitch.  None of the foam problems - a fast thin tan head. Apricot, plum/prune with something weird and wicked in the nose. Strange fruit -- near citrus -- then flat across the tongue, sharp sweetness and ending in grapefruit sour. This is closer to a faro gueze and not like anything Ive tasted. Its challenging, complex and rewarding. A delicate something to let warm as you go and listen again and again...","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
3498,"2001-07-13",2.7,"Ditto. I poured barely 1/4 of the bottle and it was foam city. Huge musty wine aroma and an unexpected oak barrel?sourness.

when I poured barely 4oz into an
