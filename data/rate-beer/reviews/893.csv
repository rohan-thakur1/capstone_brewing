Aftertaste has rice, dust, warmth, yeast and some fruit like apples.
No carbo, soft oily mouthfeel (which becomes spicier at time), medium to full body and an oily texture.

893,"2011-10-02",3.6,"350 ml bottle @ home. Clear straw-yellow body. Aroma is dominated by citric fruit but there is also a hint of raisins and some alcohol in the direction of noble German eiswein. This is stronger in aroma compared with other sakes from Nøgne Ø. Flavor is fruity, especially citric, with a nice hint of acidity and warming alcohol. Soft and fat mouth feel. Long and pleasant aftertastes where a faint hint of fruity bitterness are detected after a while. A very nice and easy to drink Sake, almost a bit too easy, as I was getting used to some more challenging flavors in Sake by now (not meant to be a negative thing, just surprised).","Kristiansand, NORWAY","Beer5000"
893,"2011-08-31",3.5,"Bottle. It pours a crystal clear, straw yellow body, flat and still as expected. The aroma is a bit rough around the edges, so a little rest in the glass does good. Its a very fruity one, with notes of pears and yellow apples, cucumber and something almost peachy. Not exactly peachy, but at least down that road. Also some cellary, rice-ish hints. Its warming and quite full-bodied on the palate, dry and acidic, and slightly sort of papery chewy. Lots of fruity flavors, and a touch of some cellar and boiled rice towards the end. Quite warming finish too. Both the aroma and flavor seems to benefit from some time in the glass, to hone off the roughest edges, and of course the palate adapts, so that after a few minutes it gets really nice. I dont think I could drink a lot of it, I know at least one of the tojis can, but like when having a glass of wine with your meal, its not the quantitiy that counts. Ok, the score might be biased by the fact that the beer is from one of my favorite breweries, and the fact that Ive waiting to have this as RB-rating no 8000 and my birthday, but Im pretty sure I can rate it similar the next time I drink it. And there will be a next time, several next times. 110831","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
