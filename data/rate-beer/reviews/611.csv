611,"2017-02-02",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 19, 2017 On tap at Tapworks in FWB. By far the best beer ive had from Highland, not to say they dont have some excellent beers. Im more of a coffee first then chocolate stout kind of guy but this inverts that but delivers on both ends. One of my favorite chocolate forward beers, up there with Terrapin Moo hoochiato and Sam Smith Organic Chocolate.","Fort Walton Beach, Florida, USA","nasty3939"
611,"2017-01-04",4.1,"On tap at Maple Hall, so I can confidently say that this is the best beer Ive ever had while bowling. Black, ring of foam. Smells mocha with extra dark chocolate. Some vanilla, too. Taste is coffee and dark chocolate and marshmallow. Even more vanilla as it warms. Nice stuff.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
611,"2016-12-31",4.2,"Black in appearance with a brown head. Chocolate, coffee and cocoa. Initial flavors of chocolate with secondary flavors of coffee.","Pinehurst, North Carolina, USA","hman43"
611,"2016-12-30",4.1,"22 oz bomber pours black with a brown head. Aroma and taste is cocoa and vanilla. Very nice beer","nashville, Tennessee, USA","edgallow"
611,"2016-12-24",3.7,"Pour is a black with a large tan head. Aroma is a nice roasted malt and cacao nib chocolate. Flavor is a silky smooth chocolate with equal parts sweet and bitter. This is so chocolaty it reminds me of pouring Hershey chocolate syrup right in your mouth. This leaves a nice chocolate on the tongue well after the swallow. Kind of a one trick pony with the chocolate but it is done so well you can look past that and enjoy this for what it is.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
611,"2016-12-12",4.8,"Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is pitch black with a large tan head The aroma is chocolate and malt. The taste is like drinking a Chips Ahoy cookie, pure bliss.","Douglasville, Georgia, USA","ordybill"
611,"2016-12-07",4.3,"This is hands down one of the best chocolate stouts out there. Pours from the bottle a highly viscous black syrup. Aroma is loaded with sweet chocolate. The taste resembles melted chocolate. This ones blows all the other chocolate stouts out of the water. I was extremely surprised by how good this one was.","Jacksonville, Florida, USA","kchampagne"

611,"2016-03-06",3.7,"Pours a black color with a brown head. Aroma is mostly chocolate with roasted malts and molasses. Thick, creamy mouthfeel that is mostly chocolate as well. Just a hint of bitterness on the finish, but not much.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","Lowe1983"
611,"2016-02-28",4.0,"Big head on this creamy monster. Sweet milk and lightly bitter chocolate. Body is quite smooth and shoes none of the 8%. Almost like a liquid whopper. Great dessert beer.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
611,"2016-02-14",4.5,"Taps opaque sable with a thick tan head. Superb aroma delivers chocolate, roast malt, quality coffee and molasses tones. Flavor presents candy-bar chocolate, coffee, roast malt, molasses, and subtle caramel and licorice tones - this is liquid dessert! Rich mouthfeel has thick, viscous body and good fizz. Take this watch!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
611,"2016-01-29",3.7,"Draft at Giant Eagle in Grandview: big chocolate milk cocoa vibe in aroma. tastes along those lines - big sweet, little roasty. easy drinking. thin to medium slick palate. not my favorite style, but seems like a good one.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","DialSquare"
611,"2016-01-21",3.9,"Half pour at Bhramahi Brewhouse. Tasty- drinks like dessert. Super smooth with the rich mouthfeel I would expect from the oats. Toasty and smoke with chocolate throughout. Truly a beer for the chocolate lover. Big and delicious. Dont feel like they cut corners on this one.","","woodychevy"
611,"2016-01-04",4.2,"12 ounce bottle. Dark pour. Creamy head. Big notes of chocolate and lactose. Cocoa. Brownie. Fuckthatsdelicious. Excellent.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
611,"2016-01-02",4.3,"Bottle--dark black color with no real head, so I got nervous, at first, the small ring of a head was tan. The aroma started as roast coffee, then after a minute or so, chocolate wafted to the nose, followed by lactose. The taste was powered chocolate, light coffee and vanilla. The finish is creamy with low carbonation. I cant believe I was only the ninth review of the beer. Its great. Total wine.","West Melbourne, Florida, USA","jhliesen"
611,"2015-12-26",3.8,"10 oz pour at Federal Durham. Real good aroma, sweet, chocolate. Dark brown color, real good head and lace. Sweet flavor. Heavy body, thick creamy mouthfeel, sweet roast finish. That damn good. Beautiful to look at. Great aroma and flavor. Real good big sweet stout.","the Containment Area, North Carolina, USA","OldGrowth"
611,"2015-12-23",4.3,"12 oz. bottled Nov 12 2015. Deep ebony with a sugary, foamy head. Big nose of unsweetened cacao, English biscuit, dark toast and espresso. Tastes of chocolate oatmeal cookie, caramel and a touch of espresso. Ashy finish provides an answer to the big malt and chocolate. Medium plus body definitely leans to the dessert beer side and has a smooth medium carbonation.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
611,"2015-12-16",4.2,"12 oz bottle from Sams for 3 bucks. Pours oily black with no head whatsoever. Aroma is chocolate, vanilla, some lactose as well. Taste is much of the same with coffee and vanilla and a strong chocolate flavor throughout. Body is creamy and heavy, low carbonation as well. Overall a very nice stout and one of Highlands best.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","metalhead0043"
611,"2015-12-14",4.0,"12 oz bottle from NC with a bottling date of 12 November 2015.

Like Youngs Double Chocolate Stout, this is a creamy smooth ale with a load of chocolate that will please chocolate lovers.  It may even have more chocolate, especially in the aroma, than Youngs. Lightly sweet with a mildly bitter aftertaste. Hints  of coffee and vanilla.  Lingering flavor of dark chocolate. 

O: a rich, even decadent, chocolate ale that works well with, or even as, dessert.  The quality is perhaps not quite up with Youngs; a side-by-side tasting is in order.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
611,"2015-12-09",4.0,"Bottle. Deep, dark brown almost black. Small head. Aroma is like rich chocolate. Taste is also like rich wonderful chocolate, roasted grains and dark toast. Nice.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","tnkw01"
611,"2015-12-07",3.3,"Strong stout, pretty smooth/milky but a bit too smoky and biter finish. Not one for me.","Virginia, USA","bigben873"
611,"2015-12-04",4.0,"Tallahassee, Fl - ABC Fine Wine & Spirits - 12 oz bottle. Sable black pour, light but sticky persistent mocha colored head, nice webs of lacing. Aroma has some strong cocoa notes, a hint of espresso. Bold flavor, plenty of dark unsweetened chocolate goodness, a hint of black licorice, some black dirt earthiness. NIce chalky mouthfeel. Very solid entrant from Highland.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
611,"2015-12-04",4.1,"Black opaque pour, tan head, good lacing. Sweet chocolate nose. Not as sweet taste as the nose, bitter semi-sweet finish, little alcohol flavor. Solid sweet stout.","ATLANTA, Georgia, USA","mcrowther"
