354,"2017-05-13",4.4,"New blend of Oud Beersel lambics made in honour of Henri Vandervelden, the original brewer, and released at the special edition of Toer de Geuze last week. Medium thick, off-white, loose head, settling as a stable moussy rim around the edge but dissolving completely in the middle, immediately misty robe (even with careful pouring as is custom with this style), peach blonde with vaguely ochre-ish tinge, perturbed by strings of fierce fizz. Lots of funk, sour fruit and dust in the nose, impressions of fermenting peaches, wild crabapples, stale sweat, very dry oloroso, old urine mixed into the whole but fitting in perfectly, raw rhubarb, dusty haymow, unripe wild berries, hints of ripe gooseberry, old jute bags, kimchi, old straw, unripe redcurrant, very thin ripe pear-like sweetish hint, wet plum stones, old wooden boards, unripe nectarine, minerals. Very crisp onset, evidently very estery, lots of unripe stonefruit wryness (green plum), unripe pear peel and raw rhubarb, sour and acidic with a thin lemony sharpness to it, stretching throughout the palate with very refreshing, crisp, bone dry effect; locked in this sourness, though, lies a balancing, softer peachy sweetish core somewhere, very subtle and hardly noticeable at first, but structurally important. Effervescent carbo of course, but, as is to be expected from the style, constructed from small, champagne- or cava-like bubbles, perfectly fit for a geuze, with a beautiful crystalline effect. Bread crust-like maltiness deep below serves as a generous landscape for an array of lush fruity esters, noble lactic tartness and that persisting lemony acidity; wood tannins are added in the background as this lovely liquid travels through the mouth and a very deeply buried, deaf and earthy hop bitterish touch meets with the sour dryness in the tail, while the crisp, acidic and pleasantly wry fruitiness lights up one more time before going down into the throat. Retronasally, the Bretty leatheriness is present but may increase over time; next to this, I get a volatile and very brief hint of oxidized old lambic too, adding further depth. This is a beautiful geuze and a worthy tribute to Henri Vandervelden indeed, noble, complex, crisp and quenching, sour but not harshly puckering, woody in the end, effervescent and refreshing - in short, everything a top quality oude geuze needs. I should have bought more bottles of this, this one may get even better with a couple of years on it... The Original Vandervelden rendition of Oud Beersel Oude Geuze was long ago, but I vaguely remember it as a bit less acidic and more outspoken bitter than this one but regardless of that, this is a real treat for lambicheads like myself.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
