1630,"2014-01-12",3.2,"A clear pale yellow body. Rice, cucumber, alcohol and a subtle sweetness on the aroma. Flavor was well balanced sweet flavor added a uniqueness to it. It was almost like rice pudding. Smooth finish.

1630,"2013-01-02",3.5,"I dont understand the overall rating, this is probably the best sake Ive had. Very smooth compared to other sakes and packs more of a flavor. Lightest unsweetened peach maybe.","Florida, USA","FudgeSociety2"
1630,"2010-03-23",3.2,"Appearance is almost clear, but with a slight tinge of straw.

Aroma has a dark sweetness, like rice pudding or fermenting grain silage.  Somewhat apple cider vinegar at first, but gets fruitier for a while, and then comes back toward the end of the bottle.

Flavor is bold, with a sharp melon fruitiness up front, yielding to a smooth carmel and vanilla sweetness in the middle, and some alcohol warmth pushing through in the finish. There are hints of white grapes and even a little nuttiness(pistachio).

Overall seems bold but well-balanced, with a good bit of complexity.","Sanford, Florida, USA","SanfordBrewer"
1630,"2008-02-29",3.0,"I had to open it like a child safety cap, which took me awhile to figure out considering you cant see what the actual cap looks like.  Pours the color of peach or nectarine flesh.  Has a lot more color than a lot of the sakes that Ive seen.  Has a nose of sweet rasins, brown sugar, and cheap caramels.  A sort of malty flavor almost like a dubbel with strong alcohol.  Very strong taste and didnt seem very refined.  This seems nothing like other ratings... Did I get a weird bottle?","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Naka"
1630,"2007-05-30",2.6,"Its flavor is mostly a dry rice flavor. medium palate with a mild touch of oiliness. overall a decent drinking sake.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
1630,"2007-05-29",2.3,"The aroma is rice and alcohol with some grass like qualities. The appearance is nearly clear. The taste is somewhat watery with rice and alcohol. The palate is thin with some oily properties. This is a pretty typical sake.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
1630,"2007-02-28",3.3,"Very pale yellow. Heavy nose of sweet, mild, licorice like herbalness, light fruits (pears, apples), and subtle alcohol warmth. Same flavor adds some over-steamed rice and a dry, starchy, alcoholic finish. Medium body. Decent.","Florida, USA","SoLan"
1630,"2007-02-22",3.7,"Pours clear with a slight greenish tint.  Smells of fermented rice, milk, some hints of maple.  Tastes of rice, vanilla, candy, toffee.  The alcohol is not pronounced or in your face on this sake.  Much better than most other sakes Ive tried.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
1630,"2007-02-20",3.2,"Poured clear, yellow tint, still. Aroma of vanilla, light toffee, light fruit, and a bit of rice.  Clean taste, no off flavors. Dominated by rice, with light vanilla, oak, and faint alcohol. Dry, ricey, finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
1630,"2006-10-16",3.2,"Bottle chilled from Party Source. Poured clear pale color with solid legs. Moderate melons and alcohol aroma. Light to medium body with a dry texture. Medium sweet pear and rice flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Smooth drinkable sake.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1630,"2006-07-01",2.9,"Yellow like a white wine level of yellow, straw essentially.  Aroma of rice and cucumber peel.  Flavor is quite fruity, lots of melon, with an almost grainy note to it.  Perhaps the most beery sake Ive ever tried.  Touch of harshness from the alcohol.  Perhaps not the best sake, but definitely in your face with the flavors.  For those not seeking anything subtle in their sake.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
1630,"2006-05-10",2.1,"Hmm, not sure if my sample was super old, but mine poured a yellow, very yellow [for sake] color. The nose is rough on the edges with grain and koji, light melon, flour and licorice. The flavor has a light acidic bite with a strong alcohol flavor, a cardboardy like feel on the palate. Finish is long and drawn out with a dry musty sourness. Ugh, not very good at all.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1630,"2006-03-26",2.1,"Cotton candy, vinegar, apple cider, licorice.  Round oiliness but flat, making for a very strange mouthfeel like rolling oiled marbles around in your mouth.  Lots of cardboard and burn later, ending in an oily, peppery finish.  Glad to see this is isnt a highly rated sake, as this is the first Ive rated after a sprinkling of hideous ones in my pre-rating days.  I yet hold hope that I will someday find a palatable one.","Pennsylvania, USA","Probiere"
1630,"2004-11-11",2.4,"this stuff was very clear.  looked like i was drinking water.  his is only my 2nd sake and i have no idea what theyre supposed to taste like.  all i know is that this thing tasted like moonshine and burned all the way down.  however, it was still milder than the other sake i tried.  the only reason i bought it was becase the bottle is cool","Asheville, North Carolina, USA","scoobyluv"
1630,"2004-06-07",3.0,"I mentioned to my good friend Chris that I was interested in trying more Sakes - and he says ""OK"" and pulls this bottle out of the closet.  His son Ryan asked him to buy it because it reminded him of our citys sports mascot ""Rocket Man"".  We argued about the phallic and fish shape of the bottle for a little while.  This is the 2nd sake Ive tried - the first was harsh and nearly turned me off for good.  Im happy to report a better experience here.  Id have to refer to this as a ""tropical"" tasting sake - the big aroma and flavors here were banana and then hints of coconut.  Smelled fruity, appeared to be a little yellow in color, very clear.  Body was very smooth - thicker than water.  Taste was smooth and tropical lifesaver upfront and very warming as it went down my throat.  I was pleasantly surprised, now I want to try more!","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
1630,"2004-03-04",3.0,"Hint of yellow in this clear liquid that is sporting some fine legs. Nose of hazelnuts, plum wine, and a hints of vanilla and coconut.  Quite thin and slippery in feel.  Bottle indicates 15% feels more like 50%. Light vanilla start with a touch of sweetness, then the alcohol kicks in. Clears the nose, warms the mouth, tongue, throat, stomach and everything else it reaches (I somehow fear tomorrow morning).  This would certainly be a quick warmer after some time in the cold. Finish is dry and somewhat woody.  Extra point for warming without being 80 proof.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
