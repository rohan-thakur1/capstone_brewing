1941,"2014-12-17",4.2,"Barwa i piana: czarna, nieprzejrzysta barwa, trudno orzec o klarowności. Piana jasno brązowa, kremowa, obfita i trwała. 

Aromat: palony, tostowy, kawowy, czekoladowy z cytrusowo - korzenną nutą chmielową oraz alkoholową. Zgrabne połączenie 

Smak: słodowy, raczej słodki z wyraźnymi akcentami czekolady (mlecznej i gorzkiej), kawy, melanoidynów i paloności. Do tego wyraźna chmielowość (owoce), z wyraźnie wyczuwalną goryczką oraz nutą alkoholową. Balans jednak po stronie słodowej. 

Goryczka i odczucie w ustach: dość wysoka goryczka (słodowo- chmielowo-alkoholowa), jednak raczej delikatna bowiem zbalansowana słodową podbudową i z raczej krótkim finiszem. Krągła pełnia, aksamitne odczucie, względnie duże wysycenie. 

Świetne piwo, choć ze względu na obecność amerykańskiego chmielu Columbus nie jest klasyczny FES. Barwa i piana świetne, aromat także interesujący, mimo, że nie klasyczny. Smak także spełnia wszystkie wymogi stylu, zatem nie pozostaje nic innego, jak zachęcić do degustacji. Z perspektywy czasu jestem bowiem zły na siedmiu, że tak długo czekałem. Być może wpłynęła na to dosyć skromna etykieta, jednak piwo naprawdę jest warte swojej oceny.","Z±bki, POLAND","tomekk1978"

I bought it from from the sister of my ex. It cost far too much. But I loved it. It was my first car and we went everywhere together. But then I tired of its sluggish ways, lack of a CD player (cassette and radio only), and increasing pinkness. I sold it for £50 to my sister. She sold it for £200 a year later. So I bought a Saab. Safe. Reliable (like feck is it). It has a HWM sticker in the back window. Im saying nothing about the beer, but you know its good.","Birmingham, West Midlands, ENGLAND","Dommod2011"

Problem is I finished it before I could thnk about what exactly it tasted like. Ive also stuffed my face with a bag of beef chili jerky from the deli counter at Selfridges.
