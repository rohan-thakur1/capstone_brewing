1067,"2015-12-25",3.8,"Bottle that has spent 2 years... If not longer in my fridge. 
Pours pretty much like champagne, but with a little bit of head retention.

Aroma is wet rocks, some sweet pear & a little earthy woodiness. Some bright berry like character is mild but adds a lot to the nose.

The flavor is mildly sweet with a dry finish. Its got a nice pear flavor and some great minerallity. Light Apple rind bitterness lingers in the finish. 

Really very good","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

1067,"2014-09-23",3.4,"UPDATED: SEP 24, 2014 Refrigerated 75 cl green bottle corked and capped poured into a white wine glass. Almost clear with a pale straw with small white head which dissipates quickly. Aroma is dry pears, medium/light body, medium carbonation, and little lacing. Taste is semi-sweet pear with some alcohol in the finish. Best perry I have had.","Charleston Area, West Virginia, USA","weihenweizen"
1067,"2013-11-26",3.3,"At ÆppelTreows tasting barn. Straw yellow with no head. Sweet and tart aroma of pears, pear skins and yeast. Taste is sweet and mildly tart with pears, pear skins and a dry finish.","Oak Creek, Wisconsin, USA","esjaygee"
1067,"2013-02-24",2.7,"Sampled at the 2013 Chicago Cider Summit. Pours a bubbly pale champagne like color with some visible carbonation. Aroma is very dry with pears with a hint of a chemical note. Flavor comes through with sweet pear up front that mellows to a bit of a dry but mealy finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
1067,"2012-11-03",4.1,"750mL Bottle poured at CiderDays 2012. Wicked complex spice and earth fruit aroma. I would never say pears, but I would say wonderful. Really bready and rich. Fluffy with an explosive Champagne-level carbonation. Nice bubbles. Beautifully complex and flavorful. My pick of the evening.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
1067,"2010-08-18",3.7,"Sampled at GTMW 2010 - Pours a real faint yellow, with next to no head. Smells of muted pear, with some green apple. Sparkling, refreshing green apple and pear taste, woven together nicely. Carbonated and effervescent. This was terribly refreshing and very light. If I see this in stores, it will be hard to pass up despite the high price tag Ive seen from this winery.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
1067,"2010-08-15",3.2,"bottle, clear pour with few bubbles, aroma of pear and spices, flavor is pear and apple with a clean bright finish some sugar","Dallas, Texas, USA","blutt59"
1067,"2009-05-09",3.7,"Bottle pours a pewter yellow with short lived fizzy head and no lace.  The aroma is quite pear like, grapes, and somewhat wild.  The flavor is nice, with pears being the obvious focus, balanced by some wildness, perhaps yeast.  The palate is quite lively, cleansing, and refreshing.  This would be a good summer drink.  Overall, impressed.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"
1067,"2008-10-11",3.7,"[Bottle] shared by skyview. Pours a clear yellow. Aroma is tons of pear, sweetness, and a touch of vinegar. Flavor is sort of vinegary with a tart/sweet mouthfeel. Very lively, light, and effervescent.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","MatSciGuy"
1067,"2008-06-15",3.8,"Another from Skyview.  I enjoyed this more than their ciders.  Sparkling, golden color with lots of bubbles.  Well carbonated.  Sweet pear aroma, and more sweet pear flavor with some yeast.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
1067,"2008-05-29",3.7,"Thanks to Skyview!  Light yellow color.  Sweet pear aroma.  Very sugary and almost caramelized pear taste.  Sweet.  Lots of carbonation.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
1067,"2008-05-28",4.1,"Picked up a 750 ml bottle at Mars Cheese Castle near Kenosha, Wisconsin, just off of I-94. Pours a sparkling light straw cider that is nearly clear with plenty of bubbles that quickly dissipates to a fine white ring. Aroma of sweet pear, a touch of cinnamon, some banana esters with yeast and a touch of creme tartar. Taste is slightly sweet, a decent pear fruit presence, floral with a mild syrupy texture. Finish is sweet, a touch of butter, spritzy with  most soft pear flavor I have encountered in a sparkling perry. Definitely a wonderful dessert perry that I would be willing to pick up again.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
1067,"2007-12-06",3.2,"Bottle. Shared by iowaherkeye. Thanks Joey. Poured a clear pale golden color. Aroma was of pear, honey, and sweet white wine. Sweet on the tongue, but not cloyingly so. Prickly carbonation tempered the sugars somewhat. To me, the flavor was pretty simple. Pear and a bit of melon. Good stuff.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"
1067,"2007-12-05",3.3,"Thanks to iowaherkeye for breaking this one out at a tasting that he hosted. The body was bright yellow with an aroma more like apple cider rather than pears. There was also some cheddar cheese. The taste was medium sweet pears. There was cinnamon and black pepper spice in the finish. The carbonation was very sharp. Good but not great.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
1067,"2007-06-09",3.9,"750 ml corked and caged bottle purchased from the Mars Cheese Castle in Kenosha, WI (December 2006) and consumed out of the fridge from a Christoffel glass.  A big fizzy noise when the cork is popped, and foam gushes...into the glass, lots of fizzy head that subsides quickly, but the roiling bubbles int he clear golden body dont -- its an active beverage, thats for sure....unlike most of the (cheap) perrys Ive had, this one actually smells like pears, Im not enough of an expert to distinguish but it has a very ripe, autumnal dark-pear sort of aroma, like Bosc perhaps?; and there are touches of cinnamon and caramelized banana as well, all in all a very inviting and interesting nose....fairly sweet upfront, syrupy and juicy, drying out and becoming tart/acidic at midpalate and on to the finish, with a very light farmhouse funkiness to it; the tartness is quite strong and dominating, but its very easy to drink.  Carbonation is powerful but appropriate for this champagne-like dessert concoction.   This is to my taste very very good, one of the best sweet carbonated perrys/ciders Ive had and were it cheaper and easier to get, something Im sure would be a regular tipple  on these sweltering summer nights.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1067,"2007-05-21",3.2,"Finally getting around to rating this.  A bit of brett character present.  Slightly sour with a light pear (obviously) and citrus acidity.  Oddly pleasant, but perhaps flawed?  Wouldve liked to see this one fresh.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"
1067,"2007-04-16",3.3,"Bottle shared by Ofortuna on 12/16/06, 1st perry Ive ever tried: Pours a champagne pale golden with a thin white bubbly head.  Slightly sweet, fruity, tart, and somewhat bretty aroma.  Body starts with a lively carbonation, some sweet pear fruitiness and a semi-tart, balanced, flavorful finish.  Enjoyable and unique.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1067,"2007-01-19",3.2,"Light straw color with a few white bubbles. Apples and airplane glue in the aromas. Flavors are lightly tart, with strawberries, cranberries and apricots.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1067,"2006-12-19",3.2,"Bottle at the YeHA thanks to Ofortuna!  Opened with a BANG!  We may need to patch up Chucks ceiling after this one.  Poured pale apple juice golden with much rising carbonation and about zero bubbles as a cap.  Nose was heavy on the sliced pears with few floral notes and charred oak.  Flavor was of tart pear and apple skins  and alcohol around the edges.. sour apple and sharp cheese appear toward the centre.. interesting, but just OK.  Huge carbonation impeded the flow across the palate.. very tart and sour.  Solid and unique offering.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

Perry is not a style that I am familiar with, but based on this Im not sure it is one I want to spend much time exploring.  I ended up giving it a slightly higher score than I would normally because of the novelty (not having anything to compare it to) but if I ever try another perry this one might be downgraded.
Thanks to whomever brought it to the tasting anyways - I always like trying new things.  Its the only way to find out if you like something or not.
Aroma / Appearance - The body looked like cloudy lemonade and smelled of vinegar and lemon juice.  Something seemed just a little off but without having something to use as reference it was hard to tell what.
Flavor / Palate - Pears, granny smith apples and a champagne like aftertaste compose the entire experience with this cider.  The finish is very dry and tart which is an odd contrast to the aroma.  This one is just a little too unusual for me to want to try another perry even if it is relatively easy to drink.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
1067,"2006-12-16",3.0,"Pours a pale gold color, no head, effervesing. Aroma is vanilla, pears, sweet. Flavor is sweet pear juice, some citrus notes. Sweet and filling, very very good flavor, not sure as per style, but my palate likes it.","Mississippi, USA","Mangino"
