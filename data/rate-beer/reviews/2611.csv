2611,"2016-06-09",3.2,"UPDATED: JUN 11, 2016 Full pour at the brewery. A good lookig bee, some sediment in the opague yellow beer and a thick, white head. Some of banana, some clove. Moderately sweet and an acidic bite that is not expected and a little strong for the style. It looks good, but doesnt have the flavor of a hefeweizen and definitely more like a low flavor kristallweizen in the flavor.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
