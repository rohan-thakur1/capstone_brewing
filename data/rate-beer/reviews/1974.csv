Let this serve as a disclaimer to my tasting notes in the below.

Poured into a stemmed Mikkeller glass reveals a pitch black body and the signature Mikkeller pour with no space left over in the glass for proper head formation with a slight ring of surface film. No lace and very weak head regeneration. Aroma is interesting and seems to match my expectations for a foreign stout. Dark but with a funky (not tart) twist that seems to have notes of chocolate, toffee and phenols. Oily texture, medium body, lively carbonation to the point of being prickly on the tongue and aboozy warming finish, which is probably due to the fact that there is very little masking sweetness in the flavour.

Pasty, chalky, mineral tinged nose showcasing more than enough burnt grain and damp kelp, brine and rust/blood. Similar on the palate. More rust and blood than burnt grain but it is black patent still that dominates this one. Salty kelp, dust, earth and ash fill out the rest. A tangy, tart, estery malt sweetness tickles the side of the tongue whilst there is an astringency to the swallow which melds with it and gives it some depth. Husky, rusty length with little of that alcohol at all to tease. Body is surprisingly light, almost featherweight and it sits lean in the stomach so wouldnt cause a problem in bulk. Carbonation a mere prickle to the front of the tongue, vinous and still from then on south. There is enough here to make it interesting, but its far from complex.

I can say the same about this, I just wish the carbonation were fuller and the sugar fermented out a bit. I went into this without knowing what it was trying to be, and it seems to sit somewhere between robust winter porter and Belgian stout.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1974,"2014-06-12",4.0,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/2/2014. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, dark bread, pepper, raisin, plum, fig, light smoke, light licorice, herbal, and roasted/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, pepper, raisin, prune, fig, light licorice, light smoke, herbal, and roast/yeast earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, pepper, raisin, prune, light smoke, light licorice, and roasted/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian stout style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Looks like a typical stout, but diverges on all other dimensions. The body is smooth and full, with higher carbonation than usual.

1974,"2014-01-21",2.4,"10/7/13 bottle (brewed at Two Roads), drunk on 1/21/14Deep chestnut brown body has auburn tints on the edges, with a charred-beige colored head that very quickly recedes to a light smattering around the edges. High clarity, with no sediment left behind.Prunes, raisins, roasted barley, vanilla, hickory and Belgian esters (bubblegum, light banana and vanilla) in the nose definitely seem pretty spot on for a Belgian stout. Some glue-like fusels are faintly noted at first. Medium strength of aroma with the esters and alcohol drowning out the maltiness.Milk chocolate and roasted barley flavors lead things off, with some dry, astringent notes from the barley and lots of alcohol fusels. A bitter, perfumey alcohol note is felt in the back of the throat and lingers on the finish, while the maltiness, sweet at first, dosent seem to have much depth and succumbs to the heavy esters/fusels. Glue, cherries and prunes all linger on the finish, and the beer remains very dry with some tobacco and dark chocolate notes. Theres some good stuff goin on here, but its pretty scattered about and this pervasive alchol and heavy ester profile makes it quite difficult to drink. Maybe they let the fermentation temps go a little bit too high on this one? I dont know, but its definitely problematic for the beer. The bottles have sat warm at Julios (where I bought them) but the other three Ive had so far (IBU, Existent and Cellar Door) exhibited none of this, so its hard to imagine thats the problem. Will certainly try again.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

My first impression is that theres a lot going on based on the aroma. Bakers chocolate is followed by raisin bread, ash, leather, and an earthy character. The flavor seems centered around dark fruit, mocha, and charred malty notes. A bit smokey throughout. Molasses, dates, yeast, and earth adds plenty of depth. The carbonation is very active. Theres some alcohol creeping in there but its not hard to drink. The body doesnt seem all that thick or full, but not thin.

1974,"2012-02-28",3.2,"In short: A sweet, roasted, slightly chocolaty stout with plenty of candies.  Just ok
How: Bottle 500ml, with label Maxs Taphouse Anniversary 25 to One.   Consumed when at most 8 months of age (8 months after first rating)
The look: Near black body topped by a small tan head
In long: Nose is roasted, cacao nibs, burnt wood, light minty notes.  Taste has molasses candy, jelly beans, burnt caramel, raisins, spicy hard candies, cocoa powder, burnt toasts, a bit of burnt red meat, very light herbal hops presence.  Full body and medium carbonation.  Not bad but overall just too candy for me.  Anyway it happened like this: I received a box of beer from GT2 during the summer and on a cold autumn night I decided to drink the Stillwater Folklore and I thought it was just ok most boring Folklore story ever","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Taste is much in the same vein: slightly smoky, roasted malts, with subtle Belgian yeast, and mildly bitter hops that linger slightly for a bit. Very little sweetness is to be had here. My own misgiving about this beer is the finish is a little thin. Aside of this, this is a clever stout.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

1974,"2012-02-14",3.8,"A steady, soft pour into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces a three finger, multi-bubble-size layered, nicely brown head that slowly rizes above the rim of my glass before . The beer is a concentrated brown, not quite black color that shows an opaque, though perhaps slightly amber tinged, brown hue when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of deeply charred prunes, dusty dark cocoa, slightly musty concentrated cold coffee, and acidic, roasted malt. The nose isnt really all that funky (in a Saison sort of way), but instead focuses more on the dark malt / grain with supporting fruit notes.  As the beer warms up a bit a slightly earthy, deeply toasty, whole grain character starts to come out in the aroma; this helps to temper the roasted grain character.  There is a hint of smoky character to the nose that seems mostly contributed by the roasted grain character.

Expressively carbonated, the beer foams up quite a bit as it hits the mouth.  There is a rich, dark chocolate and cold espresso like dark grain character here that lingers on in the finish with a burnt, though smooth, edge.  My second sip has me noticing a subtle, underlying fruitiness that tastes of burned prunes and raisins. Deeply toasted, brown-whole-grain flavors intermingle with the deeply roasted notes.  The body is quite light compared to something like a Stout, though it isnt as bone thin as a my favorite type of pale Saisons; here though the beer needs a touch of body to counteract the roast malt character, and this one has a little something extra to the texture.  This slight viscous character certainly doesnt balance the dominant roast character though, so you need to be in the mood for a deeply roasted beer.  The burnt / roasted character adds a definite bitterness and even some acidity to this beer; this last is also accentuated by the carbonic bite that is in this beer.  There is a touch of smokiness to the finish that is brought out by the roasted character and perhaps a hint of phenolics. Actually the smokiness is a bit more pervasive, though still on the subtler side, with a rich character evocative of umami and salt that adds a certain savory quality to this beer that boosts the perceived body of this brew. This smokiness / savory quality goes a long way towards balancing out this beer as it warms up.

I really wonder what the yeast used was here, the beer is quite dry for a Stout, though not excessively so, and is certainly quite clean for a Saison or Belgianish creation; whatever it is, the beer is fairly cleanly fermented, but definitely dry / light for a beer of this strength. In the end this is quite nice, it really needs to warm up a bit (I initially served it at 50°F / 10°C) before it gets balanced, and actually it starts out a bit too carbonated for the roast and smoke character, but some air and time help with that nicely as well.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
1974,"2012-02-08",3.6,"3oz taster at DBS. This one had a much richer aroma and didnt taste as dry, which was much welcomed. This full flavored and palated beer was smooth and not bitter. Very enjoyable and good beer.

1974,"2011-09-09",3.8,"500ml bottle.  Black at first glace, the dark, inky, mahogany colored body supports a small crown of smooth, dark khaki foam.  Settling in as a thin film, the head leaves scant, rounded flares of lacing behind.  Aromas are darkly roasted, showing notes of toasted, bittersweet cacao nibs, singed caramel, burnt barley, and subtle wisps of anise.  Belgian yeast offers a dry, slightly creamy element, hinting also at some dark spice and dark fruit esters.  Flavors are very well balanced (for my palate anyway....might be a bit on the dry/roasty side for most), again based in darkly roasted barley, bittersweet cacao, and burn caramel, but also nicely hopped with earthen tones, and dried out with spicy, fruity Belgian yeast.  The finish is long and roasty.  The palate sports ample body, yet remains fleet of foot due to the significant attenuation and lively, active carbonation.  The flurry of micro-bubbles on the tongue intensifies the spiciness of the yeast.  Overall, I find this to be a damn fine, highly drinkable foreign stout.  Stillwater does a really good job with this Belgian yeast.  Good stuff.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

1974,"2011-05-13",3.8,"Thanks to Holdwine.;  Although changed to stout category I think this beer could fall into the belgian strong ale category, somewhere in between a triple, quad and stout.  To me the belgian yeast comes through with a dark fruit, yeasty, bready and slightly sour character. very belgian.  The malt character is also there, with undertones of chocolate, coffee and smoke.  Whatever the category its a fine beer to be coming out of the BWI area and a new brewer.  Great balance, complex flavors, good stuff.","Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA","Jayb0"

1974,"2011-04-22",3.3,"Picked up this bottle at Whole Foods in DC. Served in a Bruery tulip.

Pour yields a nearly-black brew with a good off-white head. Nice creamy head that sticks around for a bit before falling down and leaving a bit of lacing behind. The nose brings forward quite a bit of roasted malt along with a slight amount of dark fruits and a bit of light, earthy hops. The flavor is fairly similar. Theres a roast component up front along with some dark fruits and a bit of earth and spice from the yeast. Feel is light to medium with good carbonation and a nice bite. Drinks pretty well; a nicely-done brew.

1974,"2011-03-20",4.3,"500ml bottle poured into a tulip glass.  This beer smells of roasted malts and fruity yeasts.  A very interesting combo.  The beer is black with a dark brown one finger head.  The taste is roasted malts and coffee notes with some fruitiness from the Belgian yeasts coming through.  Definitely get notes of coffee and chocolate, but the yeasts make it different than a traditional Stout.  Palate is medium to heavy body with average carbonation.
