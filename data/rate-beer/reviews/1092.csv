1092,"2011-11-05",2.7,"Bottle, 75cl. Its an almost colorless perry, some yellowish tints though. Clear. The aroma is on the fruity side, pears and apples, and some farmyard hints. Some sulphur notes in both aroma and flavor. Else theres pears dominating the flavor, something I dont recognize blends in. Its quite sweetish too, medium to full bodied and quite oily. A decent perry, but not very interesting. 111105","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

Incredibly juicy yet dry in the mouth. Just the right level of fruit and wood. Effortlessly drinkable. Hints of vanilla and cinnamon are just about perfect. Absolutely outstanding stuff.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
1092,"2010-01-31",4.3,"Beautiful clear deep pale straw golden body; Incredible nose with lots of both depth and fill, a near perfect constellation of dense almost petrol like perry aromas, mellow yeasts and the dense but light harshness from the peel; Incredible body, velvet soft oily texture some sweetness the its not the least vulgar but has lots of freshness to it is super balanced with a very dry yeast peel like harshness; The dry part continues with great length in the finish, again with the sweetness near perfectly on the side, perry meat and lots of peel aromas, even a very light barrel touch that gives an almost smoked touch very late in the finish.

1092,"2009-10-12",3.7,"Bottle from Oakchurch Farm Shop, Staunton on Wye, Herefordshire, consumed 11-10-09   Pours a very, very light silvery gold colour, its as clear as a bell. Soft sweet juicy pears on the aroma. The taste is of soft sweet pear, touch overipe, little bit of dustiness from somewhere (glass was clean?), really just loads of lovely squishy overipe pear, bit sweet possibly and a totally differnet perry to the recently tried Thorn but nonetheless, its very, very good.
