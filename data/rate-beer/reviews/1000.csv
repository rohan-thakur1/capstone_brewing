Pours moderately hazy/cloudy deep orange copper color with a 2-3 finger dense and fluffy off white head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of tart green apple, lemon zest, orange peel, pear, clove, pepper, hay, straw, grass, oak, musty funk, bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky/spicy yeast, oak, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of tart green apple. lemon zest, orange peel, pear, clove, pepper, oak, hay, straw, grass, herbal, musty funk, bread, and yeast/mineral earthiness. Good amount of earthy tartness/spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of green apple, lemon zest, orange peel, pear, clove, pepper, oak, hay, straw, grass, musty funk, bread, herbal, and yeast/mineral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity/funky/spicy yeast, oak, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly prickly/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian pale ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/funky/spicy yeast, oak, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

The aroma is earthy, a little briny, some melon rind, some doughiness, a bit of earthy hop. Some barnyard horse and hay character is going on here as well. 

The Flavor is lightly sour, lemony, and quite earthy. The hoppiness is fairly light but ever-present, leafy, earthy, and enjoyable. The beer has a bit of exotic fruitiness and a little bit of light brine.

1000,"2010-08-01",3.9,"Deep oranges and coppers wink seductively at me from behind her glass window as a slow haze settles in. A massive head slowly settles into a velveteen blanket of equally enormous proportions. Lurking near the bottom are scattered dregs while reaching out to me is a nose ripe with tart and funk. Be still my beating heart. Grapefruit rind, and lemon skins tantalize while water crackers crunch silently. Weaving in and out of her citrusy aromas is tartness and the earthen funk of leather, sawdust, old baled hay, and sour fruits. Lip-smacking delicious if I do say so, despite my lips having not touched hers yet. That is about to change though, rightaboutnow. Bubbly effervescence gives her palate buoyancy, enhancing the lemon pith and tart fruit skins dancing playfully atop my tastebuds. Immediately my palate dries in long-lasting earth, funk, sawdust, leather, and old hay. Her massive head leaves gorgeous trails of lace along the sides of my glass as I lustily work my through her curves. The front of her palate is bright with lemon and grapefruit while underneath all her Brett delights work their funky magic. Refreshing, satisfying, and thirst-inducing all at the same time, I rightfully come back for more again and again until disaster strikes: my glass is empty, and so is the bottle. Thankfully, my breath remains ripe with citrus, leather, and barnyard funk. Tasty.


The Petoskey Pale Ale may have been a Leelanau contract brew, but by choosing Jolly Pumpkin as their brewer of choice, it is equally a Jolly Pumpkin beer. Those wonderful wood barrels that Jolly Pumpkin matures all their beers in definitely had a say in the final character of the Petosky Pale Ale, a most agreeable one at that.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Slightly tart and apple sweetness up front, then dry woody notes and some really dry, earthy, peppery hop bittering on the end that is quite interesting.

1000,"2009-09-16",3.7,"In short: A strange out-of-control funky, uber-hoppy and spicy beer with an oaky sourness.  Very good even if all over the place.
How: Bottle 500ml.  Age unknown (probably a few months old), consumed a few weeks after receiving it from Solan.  Thanks a lot Alan
The look: Cloudy golden orange body topped by a large off-white head
In long: Strong nose of spicy hops, brett and Jolly Pumpkin barrels.  Taste is really all over the place.  A lot of hops, very yeasty, strong spicy character, burnt grass, very woody with a light Oak sourness, green apples, caramel, .  Dry dusty barn finish with an acidic touch.  On one hand there is some strong Orval similarities that I enjoyed so very much (Oval = best beer on the planet) but it also came with some undesirable flavours that didnt sit well with the rest of the beer (most notably the oaky sourness).  Wild crazy stuff here that doesnt fit onto any category.  But ratebeer doesnt have that miscellaneous drawer that we all have in our bedroom where we put stuff that doesnt go anywhere else.

Unbelievably satisfying aroma.  Soft, natural carbonation, fine bubbles cover the tongue and prick the palate, with a full, chewy and frothy body.

1000,"2009-03-11",3.9,"A careful pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip still produces an almost four-finger thick, lightly tanned, frothy, long lasting, lace inducing, structurally crevassed head.  The beer is a murky honey-amber color that shows an opaque, orange tinged, light red hue when held up to the light.  The beer has a distinct Brettanomyces signature aroma to it that is noticeable as I pour the beer.  There is a solid malty bread character, a nice biscuit-like note with just a solid, fresh malt character.  A spicy mustiness along with some fruity notes of ripe pear, and a touch of slightly under-ripe melon add more complexity.  The aroma is quite complex, at times I get notes of black pepper, lightly tart star fruit, musky sweat-dried leather, earthy grain, some bright berry notes at times that turn into citrusy hop notes that becomes more distinct after I notice it (orange zest and a touch of tangelo).  I am really enjoying the aroma of this beer, it is quite complex, demanding of an exploration.  After visiting the flavor for a bit, I am able to pull out oak-barrel aromas that add a spiciness to the aroma as well a woody-oak character; the aroma just seems to reveal more and more layers, what more can you ask for.

Perhaps a little cold, the beer is quite dry though and fairly light bodied.  The finish has a lingering, Brettanomyces driven, butyric acid character that is a bit musky and a bit like a spicy, plastic note that adds a touch of astringency.  This blends with an herbal hop bitterness that also lingers on in the finish with a clean bite.  Up front the hop character adds an underlying, yet distinct, citrus oil flavor to this beer.  This has quite a bit of spiciness to it, much of it is oak influenced, but the Brettanomyces and other fermentation notes also add a fair amount of spiciness to this brew.  Underneath the funkiness there is a malt character that provides soda-cracker like notes as well as a dry biscuit character both of which linger for quite some time on the palate along with the other notes.  By the time I took my first sip (spent quite a bit of time with the aroma I guess), this beer was only lightly fizzy, which accentuates a soft creaminess.  This has a fairly light tartness to it, which accentuates a touch of fruitiness that remind me of a pear more than anything.

The flavor doesnt quite live up to the layered complexity that defines the nose, but overall this is still quite a good beer.  Definitely funky, and definitely interesting and I really like how easy drinking the texture makes this beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

1000,"2009-02-19",3.4,"It poured a hazy amber, a strong surge of carbonation leading to an intense head eventually collapsing under its own weight into brilliant white pinpricks.

The aroma belies the simple pale ale tag. Theres brett here but its.... tangential. Its the fruits that are driving me mad... what the hell are they? Is that peach? One thats been steeped in a fragrant white wine? Even strawberry? Just a hint, mind, of those bits of over-ripe ones crushed in the bottom of a punnet when you pick your own. 

Those sweeter flavours are carried along with a pleasing sour note and a surprising light citric hop feel. The brett keeps itching away and theres some lovely floral notes towards a pronouncedly sourer finish. Decent dryness throughout leaves a layer of near-herbally vineous flavours to play with around your palate.","Derby, Derbyshire, ENGLAND","haddonsman"

1000,"2009-01-08",4.3,"Finally Finally get to try this beer.  Bottles from Fiver29, and MrBunn.  Shared with Dalekliz, michigan native and the one who got me to try the other 2 Leelanau beers.  Gotta keep up my rep as a top rater of JP also.  Bottle popped with some gush.  Pours orange with a 1 finger tan head.  Nose is tart funky and super appealing.  Really damn nice nose.  Taste is bittered and sour and funky, cant tell if its because of the carbonation or what, the taste is a little off but the aroma is so welcoming.  Super tasty and interesting.  24th JP Rating.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
1000,"2009-01-07",1.7,"Bottle with the Club. Pours a hazy light brown with a white head. Bitter with a mellow sourness. Aromas of brett, rye and pepper. Very high carbonation. Not good.","Copenhagen OE, DENMARK","sunevdj"
1000,"2009-01-07",4.1,"Growing up in MI, I remember there was always something special about having Petoskey Stones. When I walked in the bottle store, while visiting family, the first thing that caught my eye was the picture of the Petosky Stone on the label. It brought back some memories for sure. Not having this before, the Petosky Stone, and knowing Jolly Pumpkin is behind this, made me look past the $11 price tag. 

500ml bottle. Poured a medium and cloudy amberish color with a larger sized, frothy, off white head. It also had a pinkish tint to it. Aromas of some funkiness, bretty, wood-oaky, light citrus, cheese rinds, and Petoskey Stones. Well not really on the stones. Tastes of some funkiness, oak, cheese, and lighter fruitiness. Lightly sweet with a light tart finish. Some lacing left on the glass. This one grew on me more and more as I drank it.

Wow, if every American Pale Ale tasted like this one! I wish I bought more of these.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
1000,"2009-01-06",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2009 Pours a pinkish copper with a nice lingering head.  Smells dry and bretty with some citrussy tartness dominating.  Tastes funky and dry with some wildflowers, soapy hints and a sage like finish.  Excellent beer!","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
1000,"2009-01-05",3.8,"500mL bottle poured into a Melbourne Bros glass. It pours with a medium thick head that subsides slowly and never fully fades, just ends up covering the surface.  The color is dark orange/amber, very thick with very little clarity. Aroma is full of brett, which is lightly lemony and very funky with Jolly Pumpkin signature all over it.  The aroma is delightful.  Taste losses a lot of these delightful brett notes. Its is a very nice fruity Belgian ale flavor with just a faint funk kick.  With the yeastiness it ends with very dry and herbal floral brettiness. Its very light and fun to drink and calling this an APA is completely ludicrous.  Its very easy drinking, light yet full of flavor.  There is a dry floral flavor that sticks around for a while.  There is a good amount of sprinkling of carbonation spikes on the cheeks, making it seem nicely fizzy for a light brew.  Its very fun to drink.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

1000,"2009-01-04",1.6,"Uklar rød/orange med et lille hvidt skum. Dufter også af rengøringsmiddel og eddike og citrus. Smager af peber, brett og noget råddent karamel. Kort eftersmag og næsten ingen humle. Ikke særlig pale ale agtig.","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Mette"
1000,"2009-01-02",4.1,"Bottle.  Pours the color of dark honey iwht a little bit of haziness and a big and fluffy head.  Aromas are of funk and caramel.  The funk is a kind of musty and stale barn smell, while the sweet hides under the surface in the nose and is of apples and caramel.  Flavor is a mix of funk, sour, spice and malt.  The sweetness seems to have disappeared (although I could swear it was there in the aromas) and the tartness and funk (apples and barnyard) take complete control of the palate.  Like many of the HP offerings, the first couple of sips made me wonder what they were thinking and the last couple of swigs made me want more...","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

1000,"2008-12-23",3.4,"Bottle. High creamy and long lasting white head leaving nice curtains. Hazy orange body. Fresh lemon orange grape fruit aroma with notes of nuts and some spice I cannot quite figure out. Mild and a bit week fruity flavor of citrus fruits and hops but the bitterness is not overwhelming. Short aftertaste, low carbonation. Oak barrels, ok but to me it is neither to be spotted in the aroma nor in the flavor.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Skinnyviking"
1000,"2008-12-20",3.7,"Bottle thanks to Patrick at the Bruery. Pours with a sparse off-white head and an orange body. Aroma is of sour funky, orange citrus, brett and leather.

1000,"2008-12-18",3.4,"Bottle courtesy of Styles. Friuty and wood aromas along with some sour. Bronse body with off white head. Flavor is mainly wheat, acidic sour bitterness and some fruit in the mix. Sweet sour left lingering on palate. Good beer. Thanks Chris","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Bockyhorsey"
1000,"2008-12-13",3.5,"16.9oz Bottle. Dry, cherry pit and oak nose. A bit hop leafy. Pours dark orangish, cloudy, with a whitish cloudy edge. Flavor is largely plain acids, and some light funk. No body. Lots of tart bretted acid. Light alcohol, plum sauce, and sweet cherries. It is generally a little thin and a little bitter. Not a substantially interesting beer. Light, summer drinking beer. But not for $10.99 a bottle. Holy crap. Light and dry, crisp finish. Underwhelming. Thanks Sean&#033;","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
1000,"2008-12-12",4.2,"Bottle.   Pours a hazy coppery color with a dense pillowy white head.   Aroma is oak, yeast, grapefruit, light funk.   Flavor is citrusy, light caramel notes, light perfume.

1000,"2008-12-05",4.0,"Bottle @ Spuyten Duyvil, Brooklyn. Aromas of Oak, lots of JP funk, yeast, some pot pourri spice. Pours a slightly hazed deep orange. Funk & oak dominate the hops but in a good way. Tartness done the JP way. Very good beer","Buffalo, New York, USA","swoopjones"
1000,"2008-11-28",3.9,"500ml bottle. Wow... the aroma screams Jolly Pumpkin. Capn’ Ron has his hands all over this one! Funky yeast and perfumy hops. A bit of earthy minerality. Rose hips, some lilac and lavender. The dryness of the wood and the funkiness of the yeast keeps nagging and reminds me that this is not your average pale ale. The hops, yeast and barrel really come together for a beautiful aroma. A gentile pour yields a thick, hazy copper beer with a frothy white head leaving a decent amount of streaky lace down the sides of my glass. Flavor is fairly clean. Soapy and floral hops. A bit of dry gravel. Pretty much bone dry from the hops with the pale malt base hiding in the background. Definite dry oak tannin on the backsides of the tongue. Medium bodied but quite creamy with a nice lacto feel on the tongue. Finishes neither bitter or acidic but rather with a nice lactic tartness.

This is a really unique beer. Floral hops, funky yeast, pale malt and barrel aging all play rather nicely. The beer is insanely drinkable with plenty of flavor. Thanks for the treat Kevin!","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"

Coriander notes. Full bodied. Mild tart funky taste. Well balanced. Finish is dry. Very drinkable.","paramus, New Jersey, USA","mkobes"
1000,"2008-10-15",3.8,"Pours a hazy sienna brown color with a massive, spongy, cream colored head.  The rocky foam settles slowly to a densely patched blanket, with sticky, broken sheets of lace coating the glass well.  Aromas include a strong bretty overtone, with notes of fermented peach, orange peel, coriander, light caramel, and a surprisingly strong floral hop presence.  Heaps of funky oak show in the nose as well.  Some of the fruitiness drops out in the flavor, turning more towards a traditional Belgian pale with a massive brett and dry oak influence.  The flavor actually reminds me of an ""imperialized"" version of Bam Biere with a good deal more floral hop presence.  Young Orval also comes to mind.  Medium-plus in body and delicately carbonated, the mouthfeel is dry to the point of being almost parching.  I’d be very interested to see what some aging would do here.  Signature Jolly Pumpkin all the way, this is another winner from Ron Jeffries.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1000,"2008-10-13",4.0,"Bottle shared by MI2CA.  Pours amber working on brown with a sticky white head.  Fruity, perfume aroma with a touch of oak, peaches, and some dusty notes.  There quite a bit of oak and hops in the flavor with maybe a bit of a brett note.  Medium/full bodied with average carbonation, and a dry finish.  Really good beer, but I’m not sure that its worth what Ted told me he paid for it.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
1000,"2008-10-02",3.9,"Bottle:  The aroma is floral with some tart cherry and faint caramel.  It pours a hazy amber with some sediment and a large off-white head.

It’s medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
1000,"2008-09-28",4.1,"Orange-copper pour with a huge rocky off-white head.  Sour, floral, oaky aroma.  Lots of sourness right upfront in the flavor with some oak, citrus and a touch of caramel.  Medium body with lots of carbonation.","Berkley, Michigan, USA","punkrkr27"
1000,"2008-09-25",4.1,"500 mL bottle (i think?)  a slightly hazy orange-copper with a bubbly off-white head.  cascade hops and tart jolly pumpkin house aroma (yeast and barrel) - bready malts and brett, and it hardly can be considered a pale ale, at least not in the american sense.  not outright sour, but approaching sour and with more time in the barrel or bottle, it might get tarter.  smooth, lightly bitter flavor with some grapefruity citrus and the tartness is well-balanced.  dry woody finish, reminiscent of bam biere, one of my favorites.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
1000,"2008-09-15",3.7,"Thanks to my friend rose who brought this back from a trip to NYC!  Classic jolly pumpkin aromas, tart citrus, great brett character in the nose.  Pours pale blonde with a thick white head.  A good bitterness with good brett flavors, mild funkiness, with a sweetness.  It reminds me of something between Oro de Calabazza and Bam with a hint of Orval.  Pretty good beer!","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
