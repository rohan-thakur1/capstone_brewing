4331,"2016-09-10",3.8,"750ml corked bottle, thanks Russ! Bottle #9612. Aroma is boozy with whiskey, vanilla, oak, caramel and a bit of nuttiness. Pours dark caramel colored with a thin off white head that has poor retention and excellent lacing. Starts with caramel and nuttiness that breaks down pretty quick into booziness. Finishes smooth with whiskey, vanilla and oak flavors as well as a lot of booze still. While some of the flavors have been broken down by time, this is still pretty good for one that was forgotten in the cellar for so long.","","zoucrew102"

4331,"2013-10-02",3.6,"On tap half pint at Gilly's Beer & Fine Wine in Rockville, MD. 

Hazy, dark rusty brown with a fine, creamy tan head and excellent lacing. 

Aroma of caramel, vanilla, prunes, dates and toffee. 

Taste of toffee, vanilla, caramel, dates, prunes, lemongrass, hops, alcohol and candy sweetness. 

Full body and low/medium carbonization. 

This brew bares little resemblance to an ESB, but does make a fairly decent (albeit sweet) brune ale.

4331,"2013-08-15",4.1,"Corked bottle # 10804 and served in a nonic pint glass: Pours darker than expected for the style likely due to the barrel, creamy off-white head and nice lacework upon the glassware. Finally got this one and for the most part I am quite happy with it. The whiskey while noticed did not dominate the profile. Nice oak and vanilla notes along with the base malts and a bit of that ""english yeast"" earthy character. I get just a hint of what appears to be Fuggle hop around the edges. I would easily buy this again.

4331,"2013-08-10",4.8,"Ive had Irish whiskeys that are made from distilled fermented barley malt, but putting barley malt back into whiskey barrels for aging is really different. Aging whiskey in barrels from Port or Sherrie produces nice differences that people may prefer. This ESB is full bodied, amply malty, mildly sweet and tastes/feels fairly potent. The hops are not overly discernible but the whiskey flavor perfectly balances the malt, producing a quite enjoyable brew. It is unusual and some may not take a liking to this style.  I really liked it - enough to go out and buy half a dozen 26 oz bottles.  The flavor is not overpowering. In fact, I had some last night after a glass of Petite Syrah and could not taste it. So I corked it back up and had it with lunch today and it was amazing, as expected, and as I remember it to be. For those who like Strong Ales, enjoy whiskey, and are up for something different, this is worth a try.  It could become a favorite brew or a special occasion brew.  Variety is the spice of life and so it is with wine, food, song and beer. I loved it and am in the lookout now  for similar brews. A friend of mine from Kentucky mentioned that this style of brew is popular there as well. I read that Oscar Blues has a craft beer aged in Stranahans Whiskey Barrels. I must try it. Prost!","Franktown, Colorado, USA","RickReallyBrew"

4331,"2012-12-28",3.6,"The beer pours a deep mahogany with a small, pillowy, beige head which is mostly diminishing. The nose is decent, very nutty (pecans), toasty caramels, slight date, spicy bourbon, light florals, maybe toffee. The flavor is similar with much more dry oak, still floral, toasty caramels, lightly spicy, and some faint toffee. The palate is nice with a nearly full body, less than lively, and a round, velvety mouthfeel. The finish is long, drying oak, spicy and floral, and toasty caramel. A decent beer but just not that interesting for a barrel aged beer. I love Stranahan's but the base beer seemed too small to handle much of the oak notes. Good not great.

Dark brown color, almost no head. The tap handle was labeled as ""twenty barrel aged extra special bitter"". The smell is heavy whiskey and vanilla but still nice and Im no fan of whiskey. The flavor is dominated by the whiskey barrel but in a good way, lots of vanilla, wood, fruit, cake, sugar.

4331,"2012-09-23",2.7,"Bottle.  Pours clear tawny with a medium to large, frothy light tan head, somewhat quick dissipation with spare lacing.  Aroma is lightly sugary oak, vanilla and whiskey, green raisins, and figs.  Pie crust and cookie malt aromas mingle underneath alongside light notes of  spicy and earthy hops.  Flavor is subtle malt, somewhat thin and hidden beneath a moderate hop bitterness and whiskey burn.  Dark fruit notes work nicely with the oak and vanilla, light toffee flavors.  Medium-light body, rather thin with medium-light carbonation.  The oak thins this beer out too much and brings a tannic character that detracts from what may otherwise be a pleasant beer.

3.5 A: Opaque mahogany brown color. Nearly three fingers of frothy/foamy beige head. Retention is good and plenty of lacing is left. 

2.0 S: Weird. It smells like sorachi ace hops and plastic. It also smells like watered down whiskey, which it basically is. Lemongrass, earthiness, and a light fruitiness. 

2.5 T: Tastes like it smells. Lemongrass, plastic, woody earthiness, light honeydew and apricot fruitiness. Vanilla and oak underneath. Strange and not quite desirable. I dont know if the weird off flavors are coming from the base beer, the whiskey, or the barrel aging process. 

3.0 M: Lighter medium body. A bit overcarbonated. A bit bity and not particularly creamy. 

2.0 D: The idea of putting an ESB in a whiskey barrel makes no sense to me. I had to buy it though to see how it would turn out though. Turns out it was a costly error as this was $15 or something absurd like that. This mainly tastes like watered down whiskey, but with off-flavors added. Not a beer worth your money.
