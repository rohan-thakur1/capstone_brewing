782,"2014-03-30",4.1,"Originally had a small pour at the Autumn Brew Review in Minneapolis but was able to find a couple of bottles as Haskells. Dark brown with a tan head, slightly bitter chocolate taste with a hint of coffee and bread. Good beer!","Minnesota, USA","gopherfan99"
782,"2014-01-21",3.8,"Bottle:   Deep burnt brown sugar, small to moderate frothy tannish head, spotty lacing.   Cocoa nose, dark chocolate, a bit wheaty.   Smooth yet soft cocoa flavors up front.   Slight hint of pasture on the nose as it warms.   On the tongue, yeah, its rich, smooth, with cocoa, some bakers chocolate, very wheaty feeling.   Perfect mouthfeel, silky, smooth, with faint carbonation.   This is not your ordinary Dunkelweizen.   While not having that banana/clove, the cocoa and bakers chocolate add an interesitng twist to a traditional ale.   Great stuff.   Thanks Bob!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
782,"2013-12-29",3.7,"Bottle, extra-ed to me by Jeff -- thanks! Pours dark brown with nice head. Aroma: banana, cloves, chocolate, wheat toast. Taste: moderately sweet, light roast bitter finish -- sort of a hefe-porter here. Medium body, lively carbonation, texture a shade thin (but probably style-appropriate). Overall: cool beer.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
782,"2013-12-03",3.6,"There is a certain luxuriousness to this, esp. with the palate and the sense of the chocolate. It has some qualities of a porter. But there is also some grape fruitiness and hints of yeast that give it sustaining interest--new flavors and balances emerge as it warms. Decent. (On tap, Stouts Pub, Roseville)","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
782,"2013-11-28",3.2,"Interesting attempt at something different, though Im not sure it succeeds, exactly. Pours a dark, cola-brown, with quickly dissipating, medium-sized head. Aroma of banana and fruit esters. Flavor is largely banana and clove, with some darker notes. Im not really tasting the chocolate so much. It tastes pretty much like a dunkelweizen. Dont know what all the fuss is about...","Osseo, Minnesota, USA","bookman10"
782,"2013-11-25",2.5,"750 mL. Deep brown with a medium tan head. Mineral-like yeast, wheat, subtle chocolate, molasses and alcohol. Moderately sweet with a mineral dryness. Lighter body with a watery feel.","St Paul, Minnesota, USA","Nsanders"
782,"2013-11-18",3.8,"Yeast, bread and chocolte on nose. Palate is like a bittersweet chocolate bread. Some dark fruit also present. Really enjoyed this, unique beer in a time when everything is ipa or imperial stout. Good job bad weather.","Hopkins, Minnesota, USA","camborne"
782,"2013-11-17",3.9,"Poured into a snifter tasting glass from a 22 oz bomber. The beer had a dark amber appearance. It had some fruit, cocoa, and vanilla aromas. Theres a mix of tart, cloves, bread, and chocolate taste. The cocoa nibs put into the beer really comes out at the end. It was a smooth and well balance beer.","Wisconsin, USA","VIBhunter"
782,"2013-11-04",3.8,"750 ml bottle. Pours dark brown almost black looking with a nice frothy sudsy khaki head that settles to thin soapy film and subtle lacing. Aroma has roasted malt subtle chocolate and coffee and hidden sourdough bread. Taste is chocolate yeast and bread with roasted malt subtle coffee and slightly bitter. Palate is thin yet has a silkiness to it and finishes dry. Very interesting and rather enjoyable.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"
782,"2013-10-29",3.7,"Bottle at Darkness Day. Pours a nice dark brown, head filled most of my glass. Chocolate and belgian on the nose, flavor is similar to the aroma. Good beer, very enjoyable for the style.","Robbinsdale, Minnesota, USA","TheHOFF43"
782,"2013-10-26",3.7,"Cola brown pour with a medium head.
Aroma is nice cocoa, light clove, roasted malt. 
Flavour is wheat, semi bitter chocolate. Bit light through the middle of the palate, but still very tasty.

782,"2013-10-26",3.6,"(asininely waxed bottle) After struggling to cut through the unnecessarily thick waxed bottle in order to open, the beer pours a ruddy color with a large light tan head that sticks around in the weizen glass. Aroma starts off well, with some toasted wheat bread and butter (which works here, and is not unwelcome) along with some dried banana chip quality lurking underneath. The nibs show up after this sits a little. They really nailed the toasted wheat bread quality, and it smells a bit like breakfast. Some roasted malt showing up further on.  Further warming displays some light smokiness and peppery scents. The flavor is more of a classic dunkel, with a good amount of roasted malt, cereal (glimmer of Cocoa Krispies), faint banana, and a good hit of bitter chocolate thats quickly ended by a snap of tart, crisp wheat on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium and carb is a little duller than anticipated (could use a bit more for the style). Overall this is a decent dunkel, and would be one Id definitely buy again if it were available in six packs with unwaxed bottles. In its current vessel, with the plastic-like wax and $premium$ price (it is a part of a ""$erie$"" after all), this will be a one-time purchase.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
782,"2013-10-25",3.4,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2014 Bomber shared by Brandon - thanks! Brown pour with a yellowish cream head. Semi sweet chocolate aroma. Maybe a bit of yeast and dark fruit as well. Pretty good!","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
782,"2013-10-24",3.9,"Sampled at the special release event at Heritage Liquors in Maplewood, MN. Pours a cola brown colored brew with a thick beige head that has some nice lacing and head retention. Aroma of Hefe yeast, Bakers chocolate, a hint of roasted caramel malt and a touch of clove. Taste is medium to medium-full bodied, some sharp carbonation with flavors of Hefe yeast, chocolate nibs, a hint of white pepper and roasted caramel malt. Finish has a distinct dry yeast aftertaste, followed by lots of chocolate nibs that lingers after the finish. Enjoy this one fresh for the chocolate, age a bit and more hefe yeast could dominate.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
782,"2013-10-24",3.8,"Nice beer from the Bad Weather boys. Pours a nice darkish brown with a nice head. Lots of chocolate in the nose and belgian goodness. Solid offering and a really nice combo of flavors going on. Not sure if this is something you should cellar or not though.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
