4341,"2017-06-23",4.1,"Interesting beer and not exactly what I thought it would be. Aroma is toffee malt and a little bit of hop with some leather Earth and a hint of resin. Flavor is sweeter malts and cough drops. Great body and finish. I would be very interested to see how this would turn out after some cellaring.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"
4341,"2017-06-22",4.0,"Golden amber color, slightly hazy, with a small white head. Clean roasted malt aroma with a spicy note. More delicious roasted, woody malt in the flavor. Nice caramel sweetness with dark fruit notes. The alcohol pops out quickly and balances out the sweetness. This is a really well balanced ale with a delicious, classic flavor.","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"
4341,"2017-06-21",3.2,"UPDATED: JUN 22, 2017 Seems to be a fairly straightforward mix of English and American strong ales, full of deep, fruity British yeast esters complemented by a firm, citric-pine hop finish. Notes of caramel and honey mix with red apple and plum, sweet but not overbearing, with a floral flourish on the back end and a modest lingering bitterness. Texture feels a bit abrasive, too boozy and overcarbonated, so aging this bottles a wise idea. Fresh, its okay, but a bit raw.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"
4341,"2017-06-20",3.6,"Another good beer in the series. English style hopping, agressive malt flavor. Very nice stone fruit finish.","Latrobe, Pennsylvania, USA","ryanscourt"
4341,"2017-06-20",3.9,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/13/2017. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/amber/light copper color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apricot, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, brown bread, and toasted biscuit; with light notes of nuttiness, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, plums, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apricot, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, brown bread, and toasted biscuit; with light notes of nuttiness, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very mild herbal/spicy hop bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apricot, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, brown bread, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness/herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, plums, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Minimal dryness. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready, and lightly silky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 8.5%. Overall this is a delicious English strong ale. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, plums, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. Deliciously rich malt complexity; with balancing yeast and fruit flavors. Never overwhelming, and well restrained. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
4341,"2017-06-20",4.0,"12 oz. bottle from the 2017 Sierra Nevada Beer Camp 12-pack purchased at Total Wine, Chesapeake, VA (bottled April 13, 2017). Dark orange pour with a frothy off-white head. Aroma has an almost reminiscent of cola with sweet malt notes taking center stage paired with faint dark fruit. Taste is really nice with combinations of banana, clove, and plum. Moderate alcohol warming. A nice surprise.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","zizzybalubba"
4341,"2017-06-19",2.9,"A bit too orange to be copper, clear with excellent head of foam. 
Smells nice and malty until I take deep whiffs. I start smelling the plums and a fairly rich hoppines. 
The fruity plums seem to be in charge to my palate. Theres a nice degree of caramel malt but the plums push the sweet factor a bit too far. Could use more balancing hop flavours. Says on the label that this one has staying power but Ill never be able to confirm. Disappointed.","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"

4341,"2017-06-18",3.3,"Aroma has hints of fruit and jam, pours a clear dark amber with a quickly fading off-white head. Definitely on the sweeter side, with a bit of earthy hop notes. The plum and fruit come through, and stick around for a sweet finish. The beer has a full body, and a slightly sticky mouthfeel. If you like sweeter beers, youll probably enjoy this more then I did.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","Nephilium"
4341,"2017-06-18",4.5,"Hazy copper color with a creamy head of calico colored foam. Juicy plum addition takes the element of a strong ale to the next level. Caramel, yeast, and dark fruit conjoin for a great brew.","","PugUglyBrewer"

4341,"2017-06-14",3.7,"Bottle in Seattle. From the 2017 Beer Camp box. Thin, pretty ring foam on a rich amber orange body, which is mostly clear. Intoxicating English yeast flavors and dark fruit. This beer is young and fresh, and I hope to stash some away to see how it develops. A fair amount of bitterness from hops. Plums are rich, and add a prune-like dark sweetness and stickiness. Body is rather bright with carbonation, and there is an alcohol note around the finish. Leathery, with some fruit. This is pretty nice, and should only get better with age.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"

4341,"2017-06-11",3.3,"12 oz otter shared by ebone1988 as part of the 2017 Beer Camp set. Bottle #1. The pour is a darker golden orange with a thin bubbly ring of white head and a surprisingly small amount of lace. The aroma is quite fruity and malty. There is a hint of lighter fruits, presumably from the Fullers yeast. The plums work well and there is a hint of some light resin behind the sweet maltiness. The flavor is interesting. The fruitiness is big from the plums and yeast along with a light maltiness and a hint of resin again. Thisbfalls off very quickly. The mouth feel is light and slick with a general lack of carbonation and a lingering plummy finish. Its not too shabby. Thats a little surprising.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
4341,"2017-06-11",3.5,"#1. Bottle shared with koleminer20. Aroma is pine, plums, caramel, booze, pretty hoppy for the style, fruity and nice. Appearance is amber, light tan head, mostly clear.

Great collaboration between two great brewers.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
4341,"2017-06-10",4.2,"A beautiful golden-orange color. The head sticks around for a bit. The color and opacity is absolutely gorgeous.

Aroma is sweet honey, balanced by dry, grainy barley. Sugary caramel malts. The plums pop out at the end.

The flavor is plum-forward, then the sugary caramel malts take over at the end. Pungent and puckering, like a red win finish.

Chalky feel. I really like this style.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"
4341,"2017-06-10",3.8,"Aroma is slight boozy, malty, yeasty with a bit of a sweet cough syrup aroma. Hard to pin down. Taste is actually quite nice. Dark malt, slight sweet maltiness, dark almost tannic dry fruit and a banana yeasty taste. Some odd parts to the aroma (seems like it will have a fake syrup to it) but the taste is much better, and not a fake syrup sweet. Balanced full flavored and quite good. Unique, complex and tasty beer overall.

Aroma is bread dough. Taste is sweet caramel malts, some mild dark fruit. Hoppiness is assertive but does not dominate. Really kind of a Sierra pale ale mixed with a Fuller Vintage.

4341,"2017-06-01",3.9,"12 oz bottle from the Beer Camp 2017 pack. The beer is a light-medium amber color. Some haze. Smallish off-white head, built up some with a vigorous pour but it was stubborn. The aroma is toasty malt with fruity English yeast and some light stone fruit skin-ish acidity. The plum is interesting. Its present and noticeable but doesnt take over and you could almost miss it without knowing its from actual fruit. The hop flavors are fruity and sweet. The flavors are already well integrated and aging should take that interesting places. Fairly sweet in taste. Lots of rich toasty malt. More of that great fruity yeast flavor. The hop bitterness really isnt felt until the finish. Its just lots of fruit on top of toasted bread sweetness. Medium body with light slickness, pretty typical for Fullers. This is already a very good beer. I think age will bring out the caramel a bit as the hop and plum fruitiness fades. Its very smooth and easy to drink. Quite pleasant. I prefer Fullers Vintage Ale, but thats a classic and this is an interesting twist on that blueprint.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
