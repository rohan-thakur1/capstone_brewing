2467,"2017-05-07",4.0,"Draft at the brewery. Slightly hazy golden color. Aroma of citrus and a bit of pine. Difference between IPA and IPL? Obviously bottom fermenting or top fermenting yeasts... but flavorwise? In its body, carbonation and mouthfeel, this is a lager. In its flavor, this brew is much like any good DIPA. Nice and smooth, plenty of citrus flavor with a mildly resinous finish. A very well crafted brew, this goes on the buy it list.","Massachusetts, USA","migwell"

Some definite malt character in the form of light caraeml-accented honey with bread and biscuit behind it and no alcohol or flaw.Simcoe seems to rear its ugly head, adding pine and the dry, boozy, resinous, almost cherry-grapefruit. Some lemon, pineapple and light mango mitigate somewhat, as lightly sweet base malts add honey as well, but the resinous character takes over, eventually.

The nose is dominated by resin, grass, and spicy noble hops, with a nice bread and hint of caramel malt backbone. The flavor is a bit more malt forward with more caramel up front, and bread in the back, with the hops showing much more floral and fruit qualities than on the nose, but still plenty of grass, resin, and spice.

2467,"2016-11-14",3.1,"From can its lightly hazed honey-gold with a short head. Aroma hops are tropical, exotic, green pine, grapefruit, chives. Its slightly dirty and barley shows its alcohol, but something smells of dirty dish rag and a low butter note that could be diacetyl emerges, but it does seem masked or blended with a cheese rind / must quality that seems more hop-derived (something I find in new German hop strains, but it also resembles the sauvignon blanc / botrytis quality of Nelson). Medium bodied, semi-sweet and syrupy with limp carbonation, finishing filmy-oily and lightly bitter. When cold the nose shows the hops well (started as a 7 for aroma), but as it warms the problems amplify and the hop character settles into a semi-unpleasant garlic-butter baseline.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
2467,"2016-11-12",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2016 Can pour into taster cup at One Stop Market 30th Anniversary. Appearance is lightly hazy, vibrant yellow with effervescent sparkle, small white head, decent lacing. Aroma is nice strong tropical fruit, pineapple, citrus. Taste is bold mix of bitter and sweet--strong tropical fruit, earthy hops, and subtle bitter resin for balance, all over a noticeable malt backbone. Palate is medium bodied with thin texture with lively carbonation, finish like taste sweet tropical fruit and mild bitter. Overall, this is really good with bold, juicy fruit flavors but includes some bitterness for balance.","Fremont, New Hampshire, USA","tfontana"
2467,"2016-11-09",2.7,"Can (Sep 14 canning date). Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is medium yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), moderately hoppy (apricot, resin, grapefruit, kumquat), with light notes of plastic, vegetables, and alcohol. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately to heavily bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic.

From memory it reminds me of Hoponius Union somewhat...i.e., a generic hoppy strong lager...but this is more boozy and with a dirtier aroma. Flavor balance is a bit disjointed; too sweet to start and quite bitter in the finish...and the watery/flabby mouthfeel doesnt help. Not very enjoyable to be perfectly honest, albeit drinkable in a pinch I suppose.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2467,"2016-11-01",3.9,"Slightly hazy brilliant golden with a thin foamy white cap. Big resiny dank nose thats a little earthy and piney. Super crisp and dry body that has a lovely dry hop piney leafy linger. The flavor is full of earthy resins and dry leafy bitterness. Nary a malt flavor to be found save for a touch of golden cracker malt, if youre looking for it. But its a hop wallop for sure.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

Its hoppy, yes, but its more floral and bitter than juicy and tropical.

2467,"2016-07-12",4.1,"This was poured into a pilsener glass. 
The appearance was a hazy burnt yellow to orange color with a thin white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Clingy white lacing glosses around the glass nicely. 
The smell starts off with a thick citrus bittersweet rind over a bitter piney background. 
The flavor embraces the thickness of the citrus rind-like hops and blends with the bitterness of the piney hops. Light dry biscuits underneath. Comes together in the aftertaste, really quick. And light and quick in the finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly smooth with a sharp contrast to the texture, still feels great.
Overall, damn nice India pale lager that I would have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Taste is big pine, resin, garlic, weed, grass and lemon notes - virtually no malt presence - big hoppy bitter finish that lingers on the tongue. Medium body with crisp carbonation. Another delicious hoppy offering from these guys.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"

Citra and Simcoe are easy to pick out but the Chinook just makes a nice aroma. taste is also good. good mouthfeel, juicy grapefruit and a table sugar lingering finish. Really a fan of this. incredible taste.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
2467,"2015-04-25",3.6,"32 oz. growler from the brewery poured 18 hours ago. Hazy pale straw color with spotty lace all down the glass. Aroma is real nice blend of scallion, dank pine and leafy green hops leaves. The flavor is really spot on the aroma. The flavor has lingering pine and scallion, very, very good for a lager, just like every other Jacks brew.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
