1089,"2014-03-26",3.5,"At the Euston Cider Tap. Still and orange-yellow. Aroma of vinegar and orchard fruit. Taste is a bit straightforward and disappointing. Short finish. A lovely perry but one that fails to stamp its individuality.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","jjsint"
1089,"2013-08-29",3.7,"Tap at Cock Tavern. Ripe pear on the nose, bit of kerosene and alcohol spice yet quite clean. Very pale straw in colour, small ring of white foam. Quite sweet upfront, dries out a bit, touch of acid with notes of ripe green pear skin, spice and alcohol warmth ot finish. Nice fullness about the body, relatvely high but soft carbonation. Enjoyable perry","Rimini, ITALY","teorn88"

1089,"2011-10-15",3.3,"Polypin, Carlisle BF. Lovely clear pale yellow/straw colour. Sugary aroma hits the nose straight away, clean, smooth and sweet on the tongue, low to medium carbonation gives a pleasant tingle and a nice lasting finish. Very enjoyable.","Carlisle, Cumbria, ENGLAND","RichardW"
1089,"2011-08-17",3.4,"From a plastic barrel.  Very pale straw colored pour. The nose is a little bit spicy and a touch of cinnamon as well. Some clove and a bit of light soft pepper. There is bit of faint sweetness and some lingering spice.  A little bit of light acetone-like fruitiness that kind of works in this context. Spicy cider but no actual spice.  Bright pear flavour as well.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

1089,"2009-05-10",3.7,"Polycask at Banbury Beer Festival, Oxon, 07-05-09   Pours mid pale golden, there is a surprising slight sharp peary tang on the nose of this one. Really good perry and quite easily the dryest of the five that we had on offer. Started of with a nice tarty and tangy pear bite. The sweetness that was initially there soon faded and this soon turned out to be the nearest to a dryish perry that Ive had, good stuff.

1089,"2008-06-09",4.0,"Bag in a box at Rare Breeds BF 08.  Hazy pale gold/green.  Nice perry.  Cheesy perry, but really drinkable.  Bit of sour sting.  In terms of drinkability, its great.  Dryness invites you to drink it again.  Lovely bit of lemon, pear.  Outstanding.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
