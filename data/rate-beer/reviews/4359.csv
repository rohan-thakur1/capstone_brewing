4359,"2012-05-27",3.8,"Bottle from Volo.  Pale amber pour. The nose is quite fruity. Lots of apple and pear along with some berry and fruit. Rich with a little bit of oxidation and some nice sweet fruit. Lightly spiced with a bit of yeasty character as well. Rich and slightly plummy. Pretty damn tasty.

4359,"2012-01-06",3.9,"650ml bottle pours a pale orangeish amber color with a huge off-white head that leaves a few spots of lacing on the glass.  Aroma is dark fruits and grainy malts with some mild hops.  Taste is malty grainy sweetness with a surprising hoppy bitterness in the finish.  An interesting barley wine with a little more hoppiness than most.  Heavy body and adequate carbonation.  I really enjoyed sampling this one.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"
4359,"2011-03-30",3.8,"Hazy amber color; generous head. The aroma is mild, malty and fruity. Good body strength; a bit overly carbonated; good malt flavor, some residual sweetness, pleasant fruits from the fermentation. Solid stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

4359,"2010-09-26",3.4,"650 mL bottle.  (2009 vintage).  Hazy orange-brown with a huge rocky head.  The aroma is remarkably mild, with just a little brown sugar and herbal hops.  Flavour is a little stronger, but is hardly aggressive.  The brown sugar is there again, along with some smoother caramel, and some bitterness in the end.  I like the grainy mouthfeel.  Hard to believe that this one is 10.5% alcohol; it plays no role in the flavour.  Surprisingly drinkable, but I expected a little more depth.  Its basically a revved-up ESB.","Cavan Monaghan, Ontario, CANADA","TheJester"
4359,"2010-08-07",3.7,"650mL bottle, pours hazy orange amber with a white head. Aroma of caramel malts, dried fruits, and hops. Flavours of rich caramel, toffee, dried fruits (figs, apricots), with a hoppy finish. Very nicely balanced.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

Slightly hazy, medium orange brown body with a big long-lasting foamy off-white head and nice lacing. More citrus hops in the flavour with very sweet tangerine oranges in thick fruity syrup. Medium-full body. Really interesting orange characteristics, very much a piercing sweet orange.

4359,"2010-02-25",3.3,"2009 Bottle. Clear warm amber with decent head retention. Sweet aroma has vanilla, some but not a lot of alcohol apparent, smells pretty smooth but not as hoppy as expected. Thick palate is creamy, slightly tacky. Decent lasting flavors are balanced. I dont know why but Im tasting vanilla in addition to subtle earthy hops. Not a bad beer, really, just not what I expected. No in your face hops, just a mellow but big beer that is very smooth and subtle.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
4359,"2010-02-23",3.5,"Bottle ( 660ml ).  Actually two bottles, bought by ... garthicus? ... shared with blankboy, tupalev ... buncha guys - at Volo.  Clear deep amber nice large lasting creamy/frothy beige head (4-).  Interesting aroma - dry, fruity and floral - perhaps a tad sweet, but an odd but not unwelcome hint of sweet cream.  The taste is smooth and leafy, with sweet juicy maltiness and a citrus zest crisp tartness.  Dry, only mildly carbonated mouthfeel, solidly average in body, fairly quick-finishing and the initial hoppiness disappears pretty fast.  Pretty solid, but not spectacular by any means;  and it certainly didnt taste like 10.5%","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
4359,"2010-02-12",3.4,"Pours a nice dark amber / red colour with a small tan head, fairly hazy. The aroma of this was fairly muted for some reason, but there was some noticeable grainy, roasted malts and hops too. The taste was fairly sweet at first; caramel and sugary, but more bitter towards the finish. Medium bodied, overall a nice beer but nothing outstanding about it.","Regina, Saskatchewan, CANADA","Sask89"
4359,"2010-02-01",3.6,"Aroma is very rich malt, with treacle notes, golden amber, tiny tan head. Flavour profile is a nicely built malt, hops and again treacle goodness. Medium bodied, very well balanced, so warming. Lovely version. Thank You RadekKliber.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DougShoemaker"

4359,"2009-12-19",3.0,"From the bottle it poured a clear glazed copper with a thin white head.

The aroma was a bouquet of caramel, apricots, burned sugar and caramel. A little apple cider and toasty as well.

Sweet and dry. Lots of caramel and residual sugars. A leafy bite with very ripe fruits, predominantly peaches, apples and brown sugar. Very warming and brash with the alcohol content.

The mouthfeel was nice, but kind of film like and the alcohols could really bite the back of the mouth like a strong whiskey.  Something that I can see balancing out over a year or so.

This was drinkable, but seemed like it needed more aging with the alcohol content. A pleasant sipper. Ill try again in a year and see how it ages.

The idea of the double mash is a good one, though must add to the cost production and I would wonder what the actual yield % is at the end.

Its great to see canadian breweries throw these styles into the mix.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","bartle"
4359,"2009-12-10",2.8,"In short: A big rough sugary caramelized beer with no complexity.
How: Bottles 22oz.  Consumed when only a few months old.  My bottle sent to me by sent to me by Hobbersr.  Thanks a lot Riley
The look: Cloudy dark orange body topped by a medium off-white head
In long: Nose of a sweet cereals, like those kids breakfast cereals.  A lot of rough grainy malts, sugary caramel, some hops with a earthy tobacco leaves flavour, light berries fruitiness.  Belgian style lively mouthfeel.  Alcohol well hidden.  No problem per say but all in all I thought this was very simple, kind of rough and way too sweet to be enjoyed in more than tasting serving.  So they say this is a historical recreation of a beer made to support a Shakespeare festival.  Why a Double Double? Two Beer or not Two Beer?","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4359,"2009-11-23",4.1,"Smells nicely of hops, strong and heavy. Dark and thick and lots of particulates, just a bit of reddish and brown. Lots of strong hops flavours that linger on long into the aftertase. A great double IPA, nothing is out of sync with the other flavours, it all balances out quite nicely, much more than most I have tried recently. There is no crazy overpowering hops hit in the aftertaset like most DIPAs, and I cant believe this is actually 10 %, it tastes more like 6.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","TheHulk"
4359,"2009-10-25",3.1,"My Bottom Line:
Strawberry fruitiness, alcohol warmth and marmelade are sent to a long peppery hop bitterness for a polished yet somewhat forgettable English-style Strong Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy sheet of foam tops the cloudy amber.
-The mouthfeel is very clean, but the flavor profile is not necessarily compelling.
-Effervescence is rather fluffy for such a strong ale, which makes this easier to approach for the neophyte.
-Bubblegum notes come from the sugary aspects as well.
-The last half is very hoppy, earthy and peppery, yet does not overplay the rather sweet first half.

Bottle. Thx Mike!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
4359,"2009-10-12",4.0,"Poured out an absolutely colossal light tan head that was creamy, lots of messy as hell lacing. Brew is burnt orange in colour and crystal clear. No lack of aroma - toffee,  melted cane sugar, sweet golden raisins, cherry, light spice, concentrated apricot or nectarine... very aromatic with a light floral hint, red licorice - excellent. The aromas are never in your face - they are soft and keep my nose happy. The taste is missing the massive in-your-face spice - which is nice. Initial hops linger for a while now that Im on to them - pine, mild grapefruit. Nice tasty mix of mild spices that I cannot distinguish between, toffee, raisin, tons of malts dominate the flavour. Citrus is very yummy, this is odd - although the spices are low and I like the citrus, my brain says these should not mix in this fashion. But it works. Excellent creamy mouth feel, wonderful carbonation, medium bodied, finishes with toffee, light roast, a slight lingering spice and decent bitterness. I gotta say that I really enjoyed this brew and never noticed the 10.5% until I got up to take a piss and almost did a header through my drywall ala NAIT.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"
4359,"2009-10-05",3.2,"Dull glowing hazy honey brown body with a stupidly long lasting very large nipple shaped crown. Woody aroma, some vegetable and there is this sharp sweaty feet mixes with caramel stink that Im detecting, no trace of the alcohol . Im not sure I like this aroma  its not bad but its not winning me over either its just lacking something.  Taste seems clean, nice and malts, good sweetness with a bitter finish. Brew is very heavy bodied with tons of in your face spice. Beer has more hops then I expected with them starting of very flowery but turn piney. I think I just taste celery but when I try to find that again all I get is a lemon lime. Very drinkable tame flavor, I could drink this all the time but there are better out there.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","Cirrhosis"

4359,"2009-09-26",3.8,"22oz bomber from Brewery Creek. Solid copper in the glass. Refrigerated and the aroma suffered as a result. The malts are certainly evident on first tasting. Strong and certainly British in style. The alcohol is somewhat evident but still well worked in. As the glass warmed to room temperature the subtle and layered nature of this beer evolved nicely. Bit of a wolf in sheeps clothing. Certainly some well worked hops in the finish. Overall a lovely example of the style and a welcome addition to a very under represented category in Canada. Nice job.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","manuchampions"
4359,"2009-09-24",4.0,"From Brewery Creek.  Rather pricy at $8.25 CAD for a bomber, but this was my first chance at a beer from Saskatchewan.  Poured a rich and hazy copper beneath a creamy small head of ivory hue.  The aroma was right for an English Strong Ale, malt although not a hint as to the high ABV, yet you certainly could taste it!  Nice, nice mouthfeel and a good strong ale finish.","Delta, British Columbia, CANADA","MrRoss"
4359,"2009-09-21",3.7,"Bottle purchased at Willow Park Calgary and shared with Parksy. Pours a dark amber brown with a lively finely-bubbled golden head that leaves fine lacy tendrils. Aroma is of leafy stemmy hops, apple skins, and toffee. Palate is surprisingly light (medium-bodied) for 10.5%, with sweet toffee malts up front, backed by biting hop bitterness in the finish. There is some interesting subtle fruit and spices in there as well. Finish is bitter and warming, but in no way harsh. Again, I find it surprising that this beer is 10.5%!","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
4359,"2009-09-14",4.0,"2009 vintage which was shared with JMerritt. Pours a red-copper color with a very small ""head"". Aroma consists of a sweet fruity, nectar note, no hops but a terrific sweet maltiness with a cherry and white grape tartness. Flavor upholds the nose and delivers a lot of malt highlighted by cherry flavors, lightly earthy roasted malt (Marris Otter I suspect), light biscuit, apple juicy sweetness and an alcohol presence that is noticeable but would not lend to the conclusion of a 10.5% beer. Mouthfeel is very smooth, finely carbonated and the alcohol does seem to lighten the beer up just a little bit. Overall a very solid brew that really does a fine job of melding fruity flavors with a rich malty body.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"

Bottle:  pours a cloudy amber-brown ale in the goblet with a puffy tan colored cap which lasts and laces the glass well.

Aroma is pure ambrosia: citrus-toffee-raisin bread dough over some spicey grassy tomes and some mustiness.

Rich buttery mouthfeel, ample malt spine.

Front side is rich in bready malts but instantly balanced by a pervasive resinous hop bite, mid palate there is wonderful complexity: toffee, raisins, citrus peel, oak,mint treacle, cherry tobbaco...excellent! Finish is wet and lengthy with the hops bittering out the citrus bready tones.

Decent malt backbone allows the interplay of spicy and floral hops to prick and tickle the palate. Traces of herbs. Minty bitterness on the finish.
