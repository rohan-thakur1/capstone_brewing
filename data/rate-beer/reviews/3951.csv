3951,"2015-05-04",3.1,"Sampled with a sake flight at a local Asian place. Fake green apple dominates. Like a green jolly rancher. Ok.","Rockford, Illinois, USA","jmagnus87"
3951,"2013-09-12",3.1,"Crystal clear super pale yellow. Aroma is noticeable from over a foot away, with lots of candied apple and sugary hard candy. It basically smells like a green Jolly Rancher. Flavor is fruity and smooth with a gentle booziness throughout. Not much else to say, its like a imperial cider but without that annoying champagne yeastiness or too much bubbly. Pretty sweet but just shy of cloying.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

Drinks with strong apple juice aroma up front, some woodiness, 5/10-sweetness, pear, medium sour backdrop, rice-alcohol off-dry, roughish ricey finish.

3951,"2011-10-25",3.2,"My first sake and Im glad to see that this isnt a ""true"" sake. Aroma was very nice. Sour green apple with a hint of pineapple and water. Pour was a dirty clear green. Taste was a tad watery with sour apple and water being the only thing present. Sweet but thin aftertaste that finishes quickly. Tastes like one of those flavored waters that are on the market.","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"

3951,"2009-05-03",3.2,"Courtesy of maniac, my first infused sake, sampled at the end of the Big Brew Day in Beaverdam.  Fruity apple aroma.  Clear with what honesty looked to be a slight green tint.  Flavor was odd, sweet apple with a strange note of rubber.  This wasnt as bad as it would sound, but it was clearly a bit different.  But not bad.  I suspect that this might be not the most serious sake in the world.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
3951,"2009-03-02",2.7,"750 mL bottle from Market Street Wineshop and Grocery, downtown location, Charlottesville, VA. Pours nearly clear with the faintest possible greenish tint. Aroma is pure tart green apple candy. Taste is a fresher seeming green apple (not so candy-like) and faint melon, caramel and rice notes. Sweet and sugary all the way through. Full bodied.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
