3112,"2015-05-11",3.8,"Tasted on draft at 2015 St. Louis Microfest in a willi becher glass. It poured a deep amber colour with sudsy, long-lasting white foam and lace. Dominant smoked malt traits, some nice rich kettle caramelization, nice noble hop balance and grainy mouthfeel underneath, good balance of bitter-to-sweet, ultra-clean lager fermentation. Warming alcoholic strength, but otherwise well-concealed. Light-medium body, average carbonation, aftertaste smokier than I can usually stand, but I loved it anyway.

3112,"2014-10-04",3.2,"Backlog rating on 10-20-2012 at Fort Wayne RateBeer Gathering. This bottled beer has a small light brown head that is mostly lasting, opaque dark brown body and spotty amounts of lacing. This beers aroma is smokey and malty. The flavor is very smokey, lightly bitter and reminds me of smoked meats. The mouthfeel is light carbonation and this beer is light-medium bodied. Overall, this beer is worth trying, but it is too smokey tasting for my liking.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"

3112,"2014-04-02",4.2,"750mL bottle very generously sent to me by shrubber85, thanks Roger! It pours with a dark mahogany body that supports a tan head of foam. The aroma has a nice malt sweetened smokiness that has a slight bacon feel to it. Wow, as the smoke clears there is an inviting rich chocolate bar aroma that lingers to the end of the draw. The taste has a pleasing mix of dark roasted malts as well as firm malt sweetened smoky notes edged with some smoky bacon. Like the nose a chocolate note rises up about midway adding to the enjoyment. Great taste, balance and richness.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

3112,"2013-05-26",3.9,"Poured into a stange. Big thanks to khumbard for this. 

3.25 A: Black color. Aggressive pour gave two fingers of fizzy medium brown head that quickly fell. 

4.0 S: The nose is just what I want in a rauchbier - smoky. Big roasted porcine smokiness with campfire undertones. There doesnt seem to be much of the lager coming through past the smoke aside from some roastiness, but thats fine, it smells great.

4.5 T: The taste is even better than the nose. It maintains the same smoke pork smokiness along with campfire, but is balanced by a sweetness - a woody sweetness - that you might get from burning certain species of trees. Its like a dark, roasty caramel. However you describe it, it works. A lot of smoked beers are a taste bud tease in that they smell super smoky, but dont taste super smoky. This isnt one of them. The smoke is deep and complex. With the sweet maltiness balancing, I cant seem to find any problems. Very nice.

4.5 M: Medium body. Carbonation isnt very active, but theres enough of it. Silky smooth creaminess that enhances the taste. Goes down far too easy for a beer this big. Great here as well.

4.75 D: Very solid rauchbier. Plenty of flavor with depth and complexity and a killer mouthfeel. Both the taste and mouthfeel were borderline 4.75, so I put it here instead.

Really cool name for a beer. The beer is black with a small brown head. The aroma brings some lager scents, roast, smoke. The flavor lacks cohesion.

3112,"2012-08-05",3.3,"22oz bottle from Keg Liquors in New Albany, IN. Slight gusher that pours a black body with a big, three finger-width, foamy, dark brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a moderate lacing.

Lightly sweetened chocolates with a moderate roast, some light peat smoke, wood, and a few coffee notes. Finishes dry and roasty with a light sweetness and a light smoke. Lengthy aftertaste following a medium body and a lively carbonation. Overall, I may have gotten a below average bottle because it was a light gusher and a bit over carbonated.

3112,"2012-05-26",3.9,"22 ounce bottle.  Served in a mug, the beer pours a very dark brown with a huge carbonated dark tan head.  Once the head settled down some, a slow pour helped keep the carbonation down some when pouring the rest of the bottle into the glass.  Head retention is good, and theres also a decent amount of lacing.  Aroma is very nice, it smells like smoked malts (and meats), roasted/charred malt, bittersweet chocolate, caramel and coffee.  It tastes like smoked malt/meat, roasted/charred malt, coffee and some bittersweet chocolate.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit creamy, but has way too much carbonation.  Even though the carbonation did settle down some while I was drinking it, it was still a bit too much for me in the end.

The aroma shows a dry cocoa and darkly toasted caramel malt base, with heaps of peaty smoke and meaty, salty overtones.  Theres a beef jerky sort of feel to the nose, but still plenty of mocha caramel sweetness.  Flavors follow suit, though they are perhaps a bit more chocolaty and coffee forward. Gone is some of the meaty saltiness, though the smoke still comes through plenty strong.  Earthy hops lend nice bitterness.  Great balance overall.

3112,"2007-06-16",4.1,"Growler. Medium density black body with crimson hues looks a little thicker than a typical schwarzbier. A thin, light beige head nearly fully recedes. Light reflects off this beer like its an oil slick on freshly paved blacktop. The aroma is hugely smoky, truly encompassing the full southern breakfast buffet spectrum. This smells insanely appetizing, its absurdly mouthwatering. The smoked malt resembles not only bacon, but smoked ham, maybe even turkey, eggs benedict and a pound of sausage frizzling away in a skillet. Just incredible. The quantity of malt in the nose is arresting, Im surprised the beer didnt glug out like tar, considering the way the nose feels. Lager yeast is apparent, as well as plenty of roasted malt and a chocolate backnote. Alcohol is a non-factor. The flavor is just as rewarding: additions of fat plums, rich dark chocolate as well as waxy white chocolate proceed forward upon first sip. Molasses notes rise from the smoke, along with hints of perique tobacco - it almost seems like the smoke is generating sugary mirages. A touch of tartness sets in near the end of each sip (totally unintrusive). The finish is full and moderately roasty, but mostly lightly smoky. Great length and a relaxing slow fade to just a hint of campfire. The mouthfeel is wonderfully velvety and is kept lively and intriguing by ample, tight carbonation. Medium to medium-full bodied with a perfect unfiltered graininess that gently fills the corners of the mouth. Delicious. I feel very lucky to have acquired a growler of this extremely rare beer. A great achievement for this brewpub. Im sticking by my rating numbers because I cant see justifying an increase in any particular category; the final tally does not reflect the level of enjoyment that the experience of drinking this brought me.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

3112,"2007-05-11",3.8,"Draft: Deep garnet. Tiny-bubbled head of light tan slowly settles but holds well.  Glorious smoked bread aromatics link up with plump raisins, plums, and chalky hints of charred malt (burnt cookies). Softly carbonated.  Early twinge of acidity is driven away by a lush surge of silky smoke and gritty roast which accentuates the chewy bready malts. Fresh tobacco contributes moistness to the body which keeps the graininess at bay while seemingly prolonging the nuanced layers of smoke. Faint cola sweetness is present, but its well attenuated. Miniscule level of esters allows the malts to shine. Malt foundation is quite clean and bouncy throughout. Finishes well-integrated with smoke, tobacco, and crisp black malt which slices its way through the unsweetened chocolate and slightly-sticky residual sweetness. Smoke and plums eternally linger. Fine work here, as its expressively aromatic in the malt department, and delightfully unfiltered and chewy in the body.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

This was a recently released beer that had been on tap for only a few days when I visited.  Since I had just missed fresh Dreadnaught, this made for a nice substitute.  If you are fortunate enough to catch this on tap, give it a shot.  It definitely is competitive with most of the beers on tap at Sportsline/Rich Os/NABC.
Aroma / Appearance - A combination of smoky rubber and warm Christmas ham form a nose that reminded me of Bells Batch 5000.  Peat, moss and spent charcoal complete a nose that is definitely smoky but not too strong.  It reminded me of the smell you get from outside a smoke filled bar.  The body was a deep black that looked like flat Pepsi with a thin oily head on top.
Flavor / Palate - The taste of a sweet hot velvet cake filled my mouth on the first sip.  After that it transforms to remind me of drinking sweet iced tea in a room filled with cigarette smoke.  The aftertaste is malty but feels like someone put sugar cured Christmas ham through a blender to create a liquid version.  This was extremely easy to drink with a full body and very dry palate.  So far the New Albanian Brewing Company is two for two on well made beers.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
