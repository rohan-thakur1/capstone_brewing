3168,"2013-11-06",3.3,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2013 Thx! to Kraddel. 180 ml. (another one of those weird yoghurt, clear glass bottles with a plastic lid) sampled. Clear vodka look. Nose is pretty sweet, cinnamon, sugar, nutmeg, spices,... Taste is simple & less exiting than the nose, sake yeast, watery, booze with faint nutmeg & more dominant cinnamon. White sugar & a bit simple. A cheap & very simple sake with a faint & curious sweetness.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

3168,"2013-07-27",2.5,"Another one from the Düsseldorf shopping tour. And for the first time ever a sake which starts off with a strange aroma of alcohol. Continues with alcohol and ends like a usual sake. First sake disappointment ever due to that fact but this ""drink"" is still better than loads of belgian of beers I´ve drunken the last 30 days.","Wanne-Eickel, GERMANY","MichaelAwesome"
3168,"2013-07-27",3.0,"Bought in a Japanese store. Pours out like water - same appearance but just a little bit bigger body. Nose of mild berries and rice. Taste of high alcohol, fermented rice, mild apples and bambus. Flowery hints. Easy to drink and more or less a typical Sake. I prefer ones with more tastes than just Sake ""Sake"" but I found it quite good.","Reutlingen, GERMANY","McTapps"
3168,"2011-10-01",2.9,"In bottle. Pours a clear, slightly yellowish colour. Aroma of Marmite yeast and alcohol. Flavours similar with lingering alcohol. Maybe a little thin for me.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","Benjii"
3168,"2011-09-24",2.9,"Typical transparent clear colored body.  Mild sweet aroma.  Silky smooth at first then a very mild alcohol burn in the finish.  Semi sweet coating of the mouth, very mild.  Quaffable but nothing to write home about.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
3168,"2011-09-08",3.2,"Tiny bit off-clear pour. Floral honeysuckle rice nose, some vanilla maybe, some ethanol. Floral smooth palate, hint of sweet fruit, slightly rough finish. Not bad.","SCOTLAND","dantheman278"

3168,"2010-10-30",2.8,"Tetrapak. A very light golden sake. The aroma has notes of rice as well as lighter notes of alcohol. The flavor is sweet with primary notes of rice, but also lighter notes of alcohol and lemon. The alcohol leaves a slight burn in the finish. OK, but nothing special.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
3168,"2009-08-20",2.9,"Cardboard brik 50cl.Clear like water with no head. Aroma is moderate to light heavy rice, alcohol. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet with a long duration.

3168,"2009-06-24",2.9,"Paperboard carton 50 cl. Courtesy of Ungstrup. Pours clear as water. Sweetish, fat and flat rice aroma. Quite full-bodied with sweet and intense rice accents with plenty of alcohol in the finish. Not the most sophisticated Sake. 290509","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"

3168,"2007-11-04",2.5,"Clear with a light green tint. Very mild scent with some koji but mostly rice. A light sweet flavor. Not much depth or complexity at all. Just an average table sake but easy to drink, not one of those ""jet fuel"" types.","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"
