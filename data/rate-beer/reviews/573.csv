573,"2017-06-19",3.6,"Bottle - Pours with a lasting white, but I could not make out any distinctive aroma. It is a Dark Belgian Ale, not great, not bad, just a silky smooth drink that goes down very easily. That's not to say it's a boring taste, but with just the single small bottle to taste, I could not isolate any particular flavours, but I'd certainly drink another one!
Definitely no bitterness, and the alcohol is definitely noticeable in the taste, not a bad thing, more like a slight barrel aged touch

Meno bene visivamente, dove labbondante schiuma non è resistente troppo, e troppo sgranata per sembrare bella. Laroma, comunque, dopo un po sembra aggiungersi anche di zucchero filato. Alla lingua il sapore di toffee e liquirizia non rende giustizia allaroma precedentemente riscontrati, ma sicuramente invoglia a bere. Poco rotonda la birra, con anche poca frizzantezza.

573,"2013-06-22",5.0,"Bière brune magnifique à la très belle évolution de réalisation, puisque nous lavons connue
à 7,5 % abv, et quelle affiche maintenant 8,5 % avec le très joli vocable de « réserve » qui
lui est attribué.
Mais lévolution principale nest pas là, mais bien dans les saveurs profondes de ce splendide
breuvage. 
Nous sommes en effet parti historiquement dune version belge de la Guinness, qui était pour
moi dans le tiercé du genre que javais classé à lépoque, ce qui était très amusant : nous avions
3 vraies Guinness belges, voire même meilleures que loriginal !!!
Nous nous trouvons maintenant devant une brune réserve qui est de nette tendance vers les
trappistes brunes de haut vol, donc plutôt une quadruple quune double....
Le niveau de 8,5 est bien entendu trop limité pour cela, mais lévolution gustative est 
purement fabuleuse, et mérite des louanges sans nom. 
Laspect visuel est resté tel quavant : coloris quasi noir en apparence, et ambre ultra sombre
en transparence, aspect opaque, mais bulles très vives partout dans le verre en transparence.
Mousse beige très crémeuse avec de petits cratères très fins : superbe.
Arômes de malt foncé, mais pas brûlé ni torréfié, avec des marrons et une très fine pointe
danis. 
1ère bouche beaucoup plus aromatique quune bière « torréfiée », les saveurs sont beaucoup 
plus fondues, avec une arrière-bouche pleine un peu sur un cognac de 20 ans...
2ème avec une superbe ampleur et un équilibre sans faille, qui va beaucoup plus loin que 
la précédente. Nous sommes demblée dans la cour des plus grandes...
3ème bouche sur des fleurs au bouquet géant, des arbres dautomne, des fruits confits et du
cake à la marmelade dabricots (alors que nous étions avant, à ce stade-là, plutôt sur du 
charbon de bois...). Saveurs prodigieuses, profondes et très longues.
La longueur ne peut que commencer sous les meilleures auspices !!!
Effectivement on est en plein rêve, cest magnifique, complexe à souhait et quasi divin.
La levure ne peut quêtre en correspondance à ce breuvage, une ligne complexe et dune
extrême finesse : superbe est un mot qui ne peut représenter quun centième de la réalité....
Lalcool est parfait pour le thème qui est une grande symphonie.
La finale ne laisse entrevoir que des nouveautés et des splendeurs dans ce monde 
dhumains qui nest peut-être pas à la hauteur de ce liquide dabbaye...
Conclusion : je ne peux que conseiller un passage par les portes du ciel pour pouvoir
se représenter ce quest une vraie bière, digne de son nom et de son histoire.
A propos dHistoire avec une majuscule, celle-ci remonte à 1125, et ne peut que nous
laisser très humble devant notre misérable condition de pauvre humain dégustant un
breuvage divin... Merci St Feuillen dêtre passé par la terre nous laisser ce témoignage
de sagesse ! Un 5 absolu est un minimum chiffré ...","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

Pours a rich medium brown or mahogany.  A one inch caramel white head is vigorous but recedes quickly leaving a frothy ring and cap, foamy lacing.

Mouthfeel is medium, moderate carbonation.

This is pretty tasty.  I really like St Feuillien Speciale, and this is another good one by the brewery.  I think this is not quite as sweet as Het Anker Gouden Carolus Classic but otherwise similar.

<b>In long: </b>Nose of earthy hops, wood and such along with the usual Belgian amber ale fruity esters.  Taste is surprisingly nutty with lots of fresh and dried fruits.  Finish is fruity with a hefty amount of woody hops.  I really liked the overall nutty and woody feeling of the beer.  Nothing new for the style but this is yet another way above average beer from St-Feuillein.  These guys know how to brew beer.  Which is a good thing since they are a brewery.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Aroma:  Some cherries and stone fruits, berries, some dark dried fruits, banana and clove, vegetal  snow peas, brown sugar, a touch of warm spices.

Lovely dark fruit aroma, berries, even plums, aven though it served quite cold. Lovely deep red, tight tan head pumped constantly by the etched Chimay glass. Quite a light palate, and with nice carbonation - extremely drinkable and not showing its strength. Soft gentle dark grains, bready, crusts. Some gentle wholegrain bits to bite on. Retronasals do give the evidence of the strength as the fruity berry esters are helped up the back of the nose. Finish has a gentle bitternes to it, some nice full resiny aspects, but theyre kept subtle. Beautiful beer. This is why I say the belgians make the best strong beer in the world.

Its aroma is suggestive of the cellar  dank and mysterious with earth and soft, rotting wood.  Deeper notes of caramel and pitted fruit add a sense of sweetness (as well as a level of comfort and familiarity). The fruitiness of cherry & peach also enhances the ""darkness"" of its flavor. Old leaves, thin whisky, hint of nickel. Full-bodied and fluffy in the mouth with a mild stickiness to let these tasteful memories linger for quite some time. 
I started on RateBeer three years ago today. And while I have made it a habit to rate a Unibroue beer on New Years Eve (and to compile a total of 666 ratings per year), 2007 has slipped away from me and my rating habits are far from the only things to have gone all ""willy-nilly"". Regardless, St. Feuillien Brune was a fine note with which to end the year, and I look forward to many more delicious adventures like this one in 08.

Aroma dominated by an oaky/alcohol sherry character, with molasses, dark coffee and chocolate notes.  Sweet malty (molasses, coffee) and some earthy flavors, with an underlying alcohol warmth.  Im surprised here by what I perceived as strong alcohol notes considering that the ABV is listed at only 7.5%.

 Pours a rusty brown body and a tall rocky slightly off white head. The aroma and flavor offer especially earthy suggestions of toffee, honey-nut wheat bread, and a dusty sort of yeasty-ness.

Poured into a wide lipped chalice at just below room temperature. Clear, ruddy bronze body donned with a very well conditioned tannish head of cream that kept on keeping on and left a lovely pattern of fine lace. Deep, zingy and slightly vinous, cherry, raisins and old chocolate nose with a hint of pepper, doughy yeast and sherbet. Sweet and fruity up the front of the mouth with all warming, drying and vinous fruits towards the tonsils. Initially dominated by flavours of cherries, raisins and dark, roasted malts it falls plague to morphing into a mix of charred berries and musty hops which linger long after the swallow. Rather light and prickly on the tongue, it was tasty up until this acrid, bitter fruit flavour took over. I have to try this one again as I hope it was my sample. It wasnt overly unpleasant so I hope an aged bottle fares up a little better. (75cL, 18/01/07, Intl Beer Shop, W. Leederville)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

The head was briefly deep and luxuriant but retreated swiftly to a thin scum. Pulled from the fridge 20 minutes before opening, it probably needed to stand longer to warm. The aroma was muted and took time to draw out. There was some appealing berry juiciness there with faint chocolate, raisins and a hint of mint. Reminded me a little of Ramsbottom Strong Ale out of England. In the mouth, juicy berries are prominent - blackberries, brambles - with nutmeg, brown sugar and dried apricots. Quite fizzy but just within acceptable range. Medium bodied. Its sweet but balanced by a long, slightly bitter coffee ground finish. Its not very bitter but quite phlegmy in the wash-up.

573,"2006-01-09",3.5,"The beer is quite well carbonated and pours with a frothy, ample, three-finger thick tan head that forms a rocky surface after it falls back down.  The beer is a deep amber color that is quite dark, when held up to the light the beer shows a brilliantly clear, deep ruby color.  The aroma is quite fruity with a sharp spicy almost woody note.  There is some sort of note that reminds me of nuts, raisins, and a hint of apricots.

The taste is quite creamy up front, and a bit full on the palate.  It is a bit sweet as well, which accentuates fruit notes like raisins, figs and a hint of apricots.  The finish has a certain nuttiness to it that seems to be derived from a bit of roasted malt.  There is a bit of a mouth drying astringent note in the finish as well.  As the beer warms up it lessens the sweetness a bit and accentuates some of the roast notes that picks up a hint of coffee to it.

All in all this is a pretty tasty beer, I could wish for a bit more complexity, but it certainly is right about where I was expecting it to be.  This is a nice beer, and I am quite happy to be working my way through a 750ml bottle this evening.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Thickish dirty sponge sweetness leaves an odd feeling on the roof of my mouth.  Iron taste?  Otherwise the flavor follows the nose.  Probably too much CO2.  Malty, sweet beer, some English hop flavors(goldings? fuggles?) & a good dose of yeast.  Greater than the sum of its parts, but not by much.

573,"2004-10-25",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 4, 2004 Approximately 5 yr old 750mL. Good looking dark copper pour. Head is small, of-white, gentle. Complex aroma has mellowed to a charming and balanced scotch ale like expressive malt fest. Old burnt cookies soaked into a butterscotch purée. Floral and brown sugar suggestions in there too. Theres still a faint trace of the hops which lent it a slight bitter finish that kept it from being overly sweet. Mild smokiness comes out through ashes and tobacco flavors. Almost earth malt notes are quickly followed by a slight watery edge just before the spicy fennel reminiscent bitterness kicks in. Yep, reminds me of a scotch ale. As far as that light watery escape toward the finish, I assume its a function of the age.

Slow start, but thinks kick in mid quaff. Loads of malt flavors coming through as the lively effervescence reveals itself. Just noticed the lace again, fully sheets the glass. Malt flavors include toffee, brown sugar, lightly toasted malt, modest licorice and rye. Once again I do have to state my preference for malty brews. Hints of hopsack in te initial sip.

I prefer the Brunes to the Blondes because of the darker malt flavours. And I like the darker colour as well. This one doesn't really rock my boat. Nice browny red colour with some dirty popping foam on top that settles into interesting patches; but it's a dull murky brown. Aroma is a little muddy as well; there's malty bread soaked in alcohol and some banana and raisins, but it doesn't quite lift and separate.

573,"2002-07-02",4.1,"Dark reddish brown in color, opaque (yeast poured).  Attractive effervescence, but this beer has a very slight head.  Aroma is very intriguing, decidedly fruity and dark, with some date, nut, chocolate and a slight alcoholic presence.  Flavor is semi-sweet and has a decent amount of complexity, with some carob and licorice.  This beer also has an unusual amount of bitterness from some interesting and spicy hops for the finish, giving it an interesting mouthfeel as well.  Some slight herbal flavors and chocolate make up most of the aftertaste.  Overall, this beer is not as sweet as one might expect, and I think its better off for it.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
573,"2002-06-16",4.1,"Kinder, gentler, a caressing Belgian with its spicey flavours (cinnamon, fennel) downed down into an easy massage of the senses.  Tends toward sweet and salt both when you get into its good round body.  Quite a treat.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
573,"2002-05-20",2.9,"Dark auburn color, very little head.  The aroma is stellar - almost stout-like, reminded me of strike out stout - Malty, soft chocolate and fruity.  The body was very spritzy, some faint sweet malty, light chocolate flavors.  The mouthfeel was terrible - this beer was very dry, kind of like a bad merlot, drys out the tongue.  Anyway, great aroma, but aroma does not carry into the body.  dissapointment, not sure what the fuss is about.","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","daboskabouter"
573,"2002-05-10",4.3,"Foam exploded out of the bottle, and the glass foamed over when I first poured, filling the air with a strong chocolate aroma. Flavor dominated by chocolate and nuts, and maybe some raisins, like a good candy bar, but with just a touch of espresso to round it out. After all that commotion when I opened the bottle, the beer itself is rather low in carbonation. Excellent, much like a Tootsie Roll in a bottle.","Buffalo, New York, USA","estoppel"
573,"2002-04-23",3.8,"Chocolate coloured, filled with particles. Very malty (too malty), chocolate, raisin, caramel taste. Creamy, almost slimey mouth feel.","Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","William"

573,"2002-03-18",3.9,"A bitter-sweet symphony of a beer!  This may be brune by numbers but it is still impressive, anyway.","Wigston, Leicestershire, ENGLAND","leaparsons"
573,"2002-02-20",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2003 Rerate: A bit of smoke in some of these beers; the Bretty nose and slight fruity hop and yeast charateristics shine at 60 deg. A world beater, IMO. Has fresh nut meat components. Original: 2/20/2002: Perhaps my favorite brew yet. The aromas of malt, wood, chocolate and some fruitiness (not as much as I anticipated) were outstanding. As others have mentioned, it is  very effervescent, almost too much, and thinner than expected. I haven't liked that in some dubbels, but it works here although the palate rating drops a hair. The finish is very long, dry, fruity but also quite bitter, at the same time, and all in a good way. Middle is fruity as it warms, but not overly so. No sign of pepperiness in the finish or middle, but some noticeable alcohol burn at the end...just enough, really. A very refreshing beverage.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
573,"2002-02-03",4.0,"The combination of double features as caramel and malts, and some fruity elements, is extraordinary. Im not a fan of those fruity elements, but this St Feuillien Brune makes it hell of a worthwhile!","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
573,"2002-01-22",4.4,"A deep, dark, cloudy brown/copper. Thin white head with thick lace. Aroma is staggering. Nuts, wood maybe,liquorice, fruit and malt. Very lively in the mouth. Palate full of malt complexities, caramel, nuts and spices, maybe citic fruitiness going on. Slighty bitter in the finish. Loaded with flavor and class. An awesome brew.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
573,"2002-01-05",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2004  Flowery/fruity/nutty/hoppy aroma, huge off tan cream head that clings to glass like a champ.  Very effervescent mouthfeel, the middle is light ans soft, the finish becomes nutty, semi-bitter and semi-dry.  This beer would go oh so well with many, many fine dishes.  Another 'standout' from one of my favorite breweries.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
573,"2001-12-06",3.8,"Light brown medium persistant head of foam on a red copper-brown brew, with many fine bubbles.
Good fine hoppy-malty nose with youthful fruit.
Foamy mellowness in the mouth, with low-level but good hops and malt.  A very decent brew, medium-long aftertaste but with excellent balance and body.
Good, well-balanced beer with quite some character, another good one!","Sterrebeek, BELGIUM","Belgik"
573,"2001-11-21",4.4,"I was itching for a World Wide Stout to wash down my food, but to my dismay, Monks didnt have it that night.  My homey Fishman, recognizing the sheer angst across my brow, recommended this Brown and I must say it was quite delicious.  Nice head, a pleasant malty flavor and subtle hints of caramel made me forget about my lust after Dogfish Head for a while.","Philadelphia, USA","Toiletduck"
573,"2001-07-14",4.3,"Bubbly yet smooth, I found this beers malty flavor to be quite nice.  Even more interesting was its aftertaste, reminiscent of cotton candy--no, the beer is not sweet, but the aftertaste does have a sweet note to it. Nice appearance and good flavor are always a winning combination. One of the best brown ales.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
573,"2001-07-14",4.6,"This is an excellent brown ale, slightly malty, and almost dry. As you get through the bottle it almost tastes a bit like a stout. This has some of the most intestingly complex flavors ever.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"
