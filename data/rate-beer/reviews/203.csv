203,"2016-12-28",4.1,"500 ml bottle, Blend 01-2016. Served in a MadTree Trunk Series Teku, the beer pours a hazy gold color with about an inch and a half white head. Head retention is good, and theres a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells like juniper, ginger, citrus and oak. For the most part I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but theres the addition of some pine, lime, and minty flavors. Sweet, tart and earthy, its a unique brew. Mouthfeel/body is light, its easy to drink and is well carbonated. Nice and refreshing, too. I thought this was a good overall brew, Id buy this one again. Definitely worth picking up if youre never had it before.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

203,"2016-10-09",3.4,"Bottle shared by a friend. Pours clear blanc with a medium white head. Aroma of malt, funk and juniper. Malty flavor with juniper berry accents before a bitter finish.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"

203,"2016-07-18",4.0,"Clear yellow color out of the bottle with a short lived, fizzy white head. Fascinating nose of sour fruit, juniper, wood and ginger. This is a tart beer, but with with woody hints, pine and juniper, some ginger heat and a clean gin finish. I am becoming a big fan of the gin barrel fad.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
203,"2016-07-11",4.0,"Pours a hazy yellow orange with white head.  Light pine flavor, citrus, juniper berry, ginger and  dry finish at the end from the gin barrel.  Great change.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Jared_Clifton"
203,"2016-07-11",3.8,"This beer pours a hazy straw-gold color with a medium white head that diminishes steadily to a film. Strings of lacing on the glass. The aroma consists of pine, herbs and malt. Light to medium body with flavors of oak, citrus, ginger and juniper. The finish has notes of oaky gin and tart berries. Pretty good all around.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
203,"2015-12-31",3.9,"500 ml bottle via local trade. Ive never stood in one of their goofy Thursday-at-noon release lines because I work. So I have no choice but to trade for them if I want them. This one pours a cloudy light gold with a finger of white head that settles into a lasting thinner uneven head. Love the fresh-seeming botanicals in here, minty and clean, with juniper, oak, a good deal of lemon and lime, ginger, and and pale and lightly sweet malts. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a refreshing, tart, herbal mouthfeel. Really nice. This was a treat. Glad it wasnt hard to trade for.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
203,"2015-08-07",3.9,"Botted July 2015 enjoyed August 7, 2015 in an Indians snifter. 

Look - Hazy but no sediment pale orange. Thick one finger and greater head but dissipates quickly. Little lacing. Head has thick bubbles. 

Smell - Tart. Berry. Light pine. Not getting too much of the gin or bourbon. 

Taste - Crisp and clean. This bottle doesnt have the barrel I hoped for. A lot of sour and grass. Gin is on the finish for a split second. 

Feel - Very carbonated. Light to medium feel. Not a lot of tingle bitter, alcohol, or otherwise on the tongue. 

Overall - I feel bad for the score. It is a good summer beer. It is unique. I have nothing similar to compare it to. I would buy it again if I was lucky enough to come across it. MadTree special releases are harder to find than Three Floyds, even in Ohio. Light sour on gin on bourbon.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","madelfonatree"
203,"2015-07-26",3.7,"500 ml bottle. Nice looking yellow. Sweetness followed by some ginger flavor from the barrel. Not too tart, but maybe a touch in finish. Very interesting.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
203,"2015-07-16",3.7,"Tap. Poured hazy golden color with an average frothy white head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate malt, juniper and herbal aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium complex sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Solid beer and exceeded my expectations.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
203,"2015-07-08",3.7,"500 ml bottle from Tmoney99. Pours a hazy golden color with a medium sized, creamy off white head. The aroma and flavor have nice evergreen, juniper, and citrus character, mild ginger, smooth almost creamy mouth feel, pale bready malts, some vanilla, some gin barrel, mild tart character, interesting beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
203,"2015-07-04",3.7,"500ml bottle. Hazy golden orange color. Nice thin sort of frothy white head, leaving good splotches of lace. Fantastic big pine in the nose, some mint, citrus. Pleasant bit of vanilla, good bit of gin works well with it all. Mild bready malt base beneath that big flavor. Medium-plus body. Smooth, lighter carbonation. Light slick texture. Moderate-plus sweet taste, nice light bit of sourness. Pleasant mild bourbon barrel gin warmth in the finish. Tasty, bright, refreshing stuff. Interesting, complex, unique. Great summertime BA beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
