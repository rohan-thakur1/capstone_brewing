1766,"2015-09-28",3.8,"Can - Pours dark brown with a ring of tan head. Nose is peanut butter and dry dark bread. A little sweetness and not much in the way of hopping. Taste is the same, with a little more sweetness to balance with the dry nuttiness. Thin and smooth with a mellow carbonation.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
1766,"2015-04-30",3.7,"Deep reddish brown. Nose of soft cocoa, dark fruit, black cherry and faint roast. Flavor is fruity dark malt and cocoa with lingering faint roast. Smooth malty finish. Really clean. A star lager.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
1766,"2014-03-28",3.6,"16 oz. can thanks to Skyview. Dark brown color with ruby highlights around the edges, no head. Aroma is toasted grain and burnt nuts.
Flavor is much like the aroma. Toasted grain upfront with chocolate following, nuts and lager yeast in the finish. The Vienna malts are deep and rich, spot on for the style. Very mild bittering hop hiding just underneath the malts. Nice. Really flavorful dark lager, easy to drink. Thanks Bob.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
1766,"2014-03-25",3.4,"Pour from a 16 oz. can. Tangy, clean smell features scents of carob, peach, milk chocolate-covered pretzels, raspberry, Heath bar, and minerals. Pours a clear, maroon-ish, medium to dark brown with a moderate amout of taupe head. The head is darker than I expected. Nice appearance. Simple, tangy, toasted malt flavor features milk chocolate and toffee elements. Light body. Crisp and lively in the palate. Easy to drink. Nice, enjoyable beer overall.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
1766,"2014-01-18",3.9,"Tap at Lazy Monk. Deep brown-black body, amber edges. Excellent Dunkel. Rich, sweet chocolate. Eastern European tradition meets US quality + freshness. Excellent. Really nails it.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
1766,"2012-07-25",2.9,"GNBF.  Poured clear, darker amber with a well-retained, deep beige head.  The aroma was on the sweet side, with caramel, chocolate, and toasty black malts.. light earthy accents.  The flavor found odd, sticky, oxidized character throughout.. toasty, darker malts beneath, but they were overshadowed.. not much hoppage to note.  Lighter-bodied with moderate-plus carbonation on the palate.. OK flow.. I didnÂ’t care much for this.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

1766,"2012-04-29",3.5,"A bit more to this one than the Pilsner.  Tasty and dark with a nice aroma but easy drinking.","Hudson, Wisconsin, USA","DasBierChef"
1766,"2012-04-28",3.3,"Tap at the Casanova Beer Cave festival. Clear deep mahogany pour with a foamy head. Nut, caramel, and bready malts. A bit of hop bite. Good brew.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
1766,"2012-03-16",3.7,"From growler pours dark brown with an amber hue and a large khaki head. Aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, nuts, and yeast. Taste is very smooth with a bitter roastiness, chocolate, and caramel. Easy drinking, smooth, and enjoyable!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
1766,"2011-10-24",3.5,"From growler. Pours deep brown with small tan head.Aroma is not much to my liking, too much yeast influence for my taste. Flavor is a good medium bodied roasty flavor.","Eau Claire, Wisconsin, USA","loafgoat"
1766,"2011-08-12",2.0,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2014 16 ounce can from the liquor store.  $9.29 a four pack.  Pours black with poor foam retention, the head is gone very quickly.  This tastes like an American micro dark beer.  Lots of caramel and black patent malt.  Nothing at all like the beers of the Czech and Slovak Republics.  Not sure what the brewer is shooting for here, but if his intention is to recreate Bohemian dark lagers, he is way off the mark.  It has that raisin/prune flavor so common to micros, but unheard of in European lagers.","Sacramento, California, USA","felsenpils"
1766,"2011-07-04",3.9,"On draught at The Fire House in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Pours an opaque dark brown colored brew with a creamy beige head that slowly dissipates to a cream top and spotty lacing. Aroma of toasted dark, a hint of chocolate, floral hops and a touch of roasted nuts. Taste quite smooth, some toasted dark malt and even some Black Malt character in the background (burnt-like chocolate malt). Finish has some low mild bitterness with a continued toasted dark malt aftertaste. Actually, this is closer to a Scharzbier than an American Dark Lager. Quite good too!","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
