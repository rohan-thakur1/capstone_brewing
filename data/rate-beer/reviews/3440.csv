Dark sweet chocolate also, and its heavy roasted. The sweetness and the vanilla us what sticks in this. Smooth! Oh, my.. As smooth as smooth gets, and the vanilla is just out of this world. Almost like my Créme Brûlée only liquefied and added tons of strong sweet chocolate. What a lovely flavor. Its a bit far out there on the sweet side, but its something about that vanilla thats just like heaven.

3440,"2016-10-13",4.3,"From notes. Enjoyed this during the 2nd Annual Kellys Island Bottle Share on September 18. 750 mL bottle. 2016 vintage. Holy hell, I never thought Id get to try one of these! The pour is a jet black motor oil with a thin ring of brown head that dissipates. This looks like a tar pit. The aroma is heavy on the dark chocolate, sweet molasses, light bourbon, and bitter roast. The vanilla isnt as heavy as I wouldve liked it on the nose. The alcohol is a little heavy on the finish. The flavor has a little more vanilla in it, but some of the other flavors intensify as well. The chocolate and molasses really explode. The bourbon takes on a thing of its own. The barrel even offers a little more. Its complex, good, complete, but the vanilla isnt as prominent as it should be. The mouth feel is thick and chewy with a soft carbonation and a bright vanilla on the aftertaste. The chocolate, bourbon, and maltiness are there, but the vanilla really comes through here. Its by far the best Dark Lord anything Ive had to date. This is a beautiful beer.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3440,"2016-09-30",4.5,"Shared bottle. Not much in a way of appearance - dark brown thick liquid with virtually no foam, something you would expect from such a big beer. Rich and complex aroma dominated by vanilla and bourbon over the black chocolate and coffee notes common to imperial stouts in general. Tastes as complex as it smells, with vanilla, bourbon, wood, chocolate, caramel and coffee nuances playing in tandem and changing one another with every moment passing since the first sip. A truly magnificent dessert beer that provokes deep introspection and will make you think about the meaning of life while trying to get to the end of the aftertaste.","MOLDOVA","sunstoneale"

3440,"2016-05-27",4.8,"2014 vintage. Extremely sweet, and this sweetness gets somewhat unpleasant after drinking too much. By too much I mean about 15oz. The flavor is completely out of balance. This lack of balance is usually a huge minus, but in this case, not necessarily. Loads of vanilla, bourbon, molasses, coffee, marshmallow, brown sugar, chocolate, and syrup in a bottle! Holy hell. Flavor is not overly complex, mouthfeel is thick, and the marshmallow flavor lingers on for a long long time. The flavor develops as the beer warms up. Guys, let this beer chill for at least a couple hours. I dont know if this beer is ""the best stout ever"" but it surely is unique and worth trying.","","Hugetaste42"

3440,"2016-02-16",4.3,"Bourbon Vanilla Dark Lord 15 vintage 

Pours a brown-black color with a dark brown, small head to it, leaving back sheets of thin lacing atop the surface of the beer. Reveals its decadent viscosity after swirling, by revealing alcohol legs and tiny, dark brown bubbles at the glass.

Intense aromas of fudge, bakers chocolate and burned malts, tied together by a ridiculously rich Bourbon appearance, featuring flowery vanilla, a whiff of cinnamon, apple piths and a ton of scentened oak. Vanilla is easily detectable, while well entangled into the Bourbon, adding a organic, sweet, flowery freshness to the chocolate decadence. Mousse au chocolate, moldy earth, toffee and brownie batter round out this monster on the nose, so far truly a masterpiece, which I actually find hard to compare to the regular Dark Lord.

Has a supersmooth mouthfeel, due to its very low carbonation, next to a silk, omnipresent creaminess, coating the tongue and soothing the pleasantly integrated Bourbon effectivly.

Tastes of a spice soaked, earth coated oakiness, featuring the beers velvet mouthfeel from the start. Develops an enjoyable warmth, as the Bourbon unfolds its spice profile, together with vanilla, licorice, molasses and fudge. Vanilla certainly deserves an additional mentioning as it not only stands out from the Bourbon, but directly blends into the beers smooth cream quality, producing a heavenly, well accentuated sweetness, from which the profound spices benefit big times during the finish. Ends with cinnamon, red apple, fudge, molasses and a long lasting, silk, vanilla coke quality, smoothing out the Bourbon oak entirely.

Wow, what a behemoth of a beer. I guess it would be almost impossible to drink more of a few couple of oz of this, if it wasnt for the soothing combination of cream and vanilla. This doesnt turn overly roasty, but fudgy smooth with a ton of sweet chocolate to it, amped up by the spicy Bourbon. The different flavors come beautifully together, while this is still being best enjoyed in small sips, as for its profound sweetness.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Either way - quite nice. Now - what I noticed immediately is that the mouth feel was tapered off from my memory of recent dark lord vintages. Thats not a bad thing either - Im impressed beyond words on how this one developed in the barrel(s), whatever it is they utilize. Sticky cake, caramel, umami, to brown sugars, moving to heavy vanilla notes once again - I get feint bourbon treatment at best - In fact its hardly noticeable and I suppose thats one element of disappointment.

Huge notes of marshmallow fluff, Crème brûlée, rich vanilla beans, super-sweet bakers chocolate, modestly creamy coffee, semi-burnt brown sugar, light molasses, well integrated woodiness from start to finish & a strong back-bone of booziness that youd never guess was 14% ABV.

The nose on this is outstanding and redolent of coconut, coffee, roasted marshmallow, and in there somewhere is a salty/meaty umami scent that somehow mixes nicely with the sweeter smells. 

Appearance: pours like soy sauce; quickly dissipating leather colored head. Very stick on the side of the glass with good lacing. Better carbonation than regular dark lord, somehow.

Taste: OMG, is this BCBS Coffee? Couldve fooled me. Honestly, very similar: here we have sweet chocolate, bitter coffee, and, every now and then, puffs of sweet marshmallow. A little sweeter than BCBS Coffee. Ends with a smooth vanilla flavor.

Palate: for as thick and sticky as it is, it cleans up pretty nicely in the mouth and feels rather light. Average to lively carbonation with a smooth finish.","Alabama, USA","Dr_MedievAle"

Split with my friend Keith who attended DLD with me this year. Served in a FFF mini-snifter. Reviewed from notes. 

A- Upon pouring, a mocha head quickly appears and dies down within 30 seconds, leaving a ring of foam around the rim of the glass. The color is opaque black, thick like motor oil. 

S- The first thing I can smell is a very strong bourbon barrel presence, but it is quickly joined by vanilla, coffee, and a sweet molasses like aroma. Excellent aroma, it definitely invites you to take a drink.

T- I dont think it would be possible to use any more descriptors for this beer. Black cherries, prunes, vanilla, followed by some tobacco and caramel with bourbon strong on the finish. There is a lingering sweetness that is very familiar from regular dark lord on the back end, and surprisingly little to no alcohol bite, even with the bourbon flavor being so apparent. There is no detectable hop bitterness. 

M- Silky smooth, yet very thick at the same time. This is definitely a sipper, but it is very easy to drink. Low-medium carbonation is right on for the style. The flavors linger and change over the incredibly long finish, definitely over a minute later I can still taste the beer. 

O- This is a very enjoyable, incredibly complex beer. Im glad I hadnt drank anything before this, because it was such a pleasure to really get into this beer and enjoy the full range of flavors you can get from it. The bourbon is there on the nose and finish, but the vanilla really outshines it, at least in my opinion. Im sure that will die down with time, although I think this is simply amazing as it is right now. It was an honor to drink this beer, so very glad I was able to score one this year!","","justforrazors"

Appearance : Dark black with very small head.

Taste : Roasted malt with big vanilla bourbon. Finish is a bit sweet with light alcohol. Lots of bourbon notes and vanilla. Light nutty notes.

Overall : Big and bold. A bit less sweetness that the regular version I think. Very heavy on the bourbon (probably accentuated by the vanilla beans). A bit too much bourbon for my taste.

How can I say this is as good as Rare? Well after drinking, my wife and I say to Joe that it is one of the best beers we have ever had, but not sure it is better than Rare. What does Joe go and do, yes he pulls a Rare out of his cellar and we do a blind impromptu tasting!!! I admit on this day the Vanilla DL was better than the Rare (I was able to choose each correctly), but the Rare did not taste quite as good as when I had it initially. I cant thank Joe enough for his generosity on this night. I guess I will put some actual beer comments in now. Of course this was a black pour with tan head.

This black, molassesy, still stout sports zero head. Beautifully full bouquet of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, caramel, black biscuits, and roasty malts. Its one of those beers where one sip crushes everything else you once thought considered elite. Everything from the nose is here in force, with vanilla and chocolate shining the brightest. Bourbon up front, followed quickly by chocolate-covered marshmallows. Massively viscous body delivers all of these flavors to my palate with its sticky, stubborn body.

3440,"2012-10-20",4.3,"750 ml waxed bottle, 552/934, served in a Deschutes snifter. Big thanks to Andrew (nasty31) for the share.

A: Pours a jet black color with a nice sized dark mocha head forming on the pour. It recedes a medium sized ring and leaves some splotchy lace along the way.

S: Light bourbon up front, but the sweet vanilla pushes right through that. A great toasted malt presence follows that with some light milk chocolate on the finish.

T: Instead of bourbon up front the vanilla is the star here (obviously). There is a mild background bourbon that is incredibly smooth. As Dark Lord is already a pretty sweet beer (especially the 2011) I felt the added vanilla bean made this border on cloyingly sweet. Thankfully there was enough roast and dark chocolate on the finish to cut through some of the sweetness.

M: Heavy bodied with a light chew to it. Teeth coating sweetness with a medium to low carbonation. Definite warming as it goes down.

O: I think if the vanilla bean was slightly restrained it would have been an even bigger homerun. That being said, this was absolutely delicious and I would not hesitate to try this again. The 4-5 ounce pour I received was just perfect.

Vanilla Bean Dark Lord pours a near jet black, with hints of brown visible at the upper edges of the glass when held to the light. Head and lacing are somewhat subdued, but given the serving medium, I couldnt ask for more. Ok, heres where I was floored. The aroma was perhaps the most distinguishable and awesome smell I have ever received from a beer. Huge vanilla - and authentic. This beer smells like someone is baking fresh flan or crème brûlée inside the glass. Fantastic. Its incredibly rich, yet remarkably smooth and easy to drink.

Upon first taste you still got the typical huge mouthfeel but even sweeter then normal and the booze was somewhat hidden. Things just seemed more smooth and more balanced with this one, almost like the vanilla cut through the oak and almost brought out coffee and some chocolate. Long lasting finish that didnt kill the palate. Very good.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"
3440,"2012-03-06",4.6,"From notes.  First reviewed 7/15/2011.  Poured from a growler into a tasting glass. 2010 version. From notes.

Vanilla Bean Dark Lord pours pitch black all the way through. No light edges, just pure unadulterated evil. Due to light carbonation, there is nearly no head here.

The aroma here is like Dark Lord, only slightly better. Maybe due to bottle vs. growler issues, the aroma is lighter, but the vanilla adds a great aroma. Vanilla lays on top of fully roasted malt, chocolate, molasses, and espresso.

The flavor just blows me away. Dark Lord improves drastically with a year on it, and the vanilla beans just take it to another level. Smooth vanilla beans up front and center, with dark roasted malt and espresso up next. Caramel soaked fudge is a delight, but the sweetness never overpowers, a brewing feat for sure. The aftertaste is softly sweet and a little bitter, with a big dose of vanilla.

The mouthfeel is thick and just a touch more syrupy than the regular version, but the vanilla bean flavor makes it worth it. Chewy like fudge. The only knock here is that the carbonation could be increased just a little bit.

Overall, this is one of the top beers I have ever tasted, for sure. Taking a beer I love and inserting the perfect amount of vanilla beans shows the artistry that goes into this beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

3440,"2011-08-05",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2015 Hand bottle at ChrisOs Pre-GBBF Shindig 2011. So, although it was great to try this beer, it came at the expense of the great Ken (MadMitch76). For those not familiar with the tale, Ken procured this beer some time ago. It was sent to him in a swing-top, Italian beer bottle (the Amarcord Tabachera). Well, Ken brought this bottle to ChrisOs tasting. The night wore on and people (Ken included) had lots to drink. Eventually, Ken brought out this bottle. He was convinced it was the Amarcord - even when we pointed out that this beer poured like mud, and the bottle had a sticker reading ""VB DL"". So, as we all enjoyed his great beer, Ken sat back and obstained, believing 100% this was the Italian beer. A true tragedy it was, and it took about two days before the generous donor realised his oversight. I owe Ken for this one. But I digress. The beer poured thick, viscous, like mud, dark brown with basically no head. Lots of dark malts, dark fruits, rich sugar. Ultra sweet flavor, brown sugar syrup, molasses, raisin. Full bodied with soft to fine carbonation. Warming finish, syrupy, sticky sweet, more molasses, slight alcohol burn, mocha. Huge beer. Delicious. Thanks, Ken. (August 2011, score: 4.5)Draft at CBC 2012 - Copenhagen. Pours oily black with a thick, brown cream head. Rich chocolate cake aroma, some sugar syrup, vanilla. Hugely sweet flavor with more decadent chocolate cake, light burnt wood, vanilla pods, molasses, brown sugar. Full bodied, chewy, with fine carbonation. Lightly warming in the finish, thick and oily, with lots of dark sugars, vanilla sauce, chocolate syrup, chocolate cake. Extremely decadent overall.

That out of the way, Id like to say that I think this beer symbolizes a lot of what is wrong with certain elements of craft beer today.  It smells fucking divine, vanilla beans for miles and miles and some hot cocoa swirled in and a touch of bourbon.  But the taste is pure sugar, under-attenuated as all hell and almost impossible to keep down in more than the tiniest sips.  Theres extreme, and then theres over-the-top, and VB DL strikes me as more of the latter.  Im giving it a 3.0 because it would make a great candle wax or Febreeze.

On the palate, this beer is cloyingly sweet with tons of vanilla and chocolate syrup.  The coffee is more or less completely lost, but there is still a bit of the molasses, and just a hint of cinnamon spice, but vanilla is undoubtedly the strongest flavor, however.  The body is super full and sticky with very light carbonation, and a long sweet vanilla and lightly spiced cinnamon finish.

Served side by side with DL 2009 and Oak aged DL 2010. Served in a tulip. Beer is about as youd expect a DL to look but this version had no head or lacing. The beer left some legs on the glass, pitch black, even at the corners. Beer coats the glass as I swirl. Super thick and pitch black. Amazing.

This beer has the most obvious aroma of any beer Ive had in a long long time. STRONG vanilla, like baking vanilla. Some chocolate, strong, complex aroma.

Mouthfeel on this beer is huge and thick but the sweetness of the vanilla (super sweet) makes it seem lighter some how. This is an aggressively awesome beer -- my favorite out of the three by a lot. It tastes like a vanilla cake...or flan...or some kind of dessert with fudge and vanilla. I couldnt drink much of it without my insulin spiking but I cant wait for DL day 2011.

Rich chocolate cake, syrup, vanilla bean, and toasted marshmallows come across, smooth, sweet, and just like a nice dessert. The bourbon and oak barely come through as the intense vanilla dominates everything. The flavors are just as huge with rich, dark chocolate and toasted vanilla marshmallows come across in a smores like fashion. The barrel comes through a bit more with soft whiskey and oak adding depth, but very little roast to balance out the intense sweetness from the chocolate and vanilla. The mouthfeel is thick, oily, and round and coats everything inside the mouth. Minimal carbonation as expected and a lingering toasted vanilla finish.

3440,"2010-07-16",4.0,"Handbottle, courtesy juiceisloose.  2009 brew released in 2010.  As expected, the pour yields an abyss-like black body with glints of mahogany at the outer edges.  Though theres very little head, the dense, oily liquid leaves a thick, lingering staining effect on the glass.  It looks simply menacing.  The nose is as rich and decadent as anything Ive ever encountered in my culinary experience.  Lush notes of chocolate syrup, vanilla sponge cake, toasted marshmallows, and crème brûlée are sweet, smooth, and very dessert-like.  The bourbon is hardly detectable, having seemingly been drowned out by the intense vanilla.  Flavors are just as over-the-top.  Insanely sweet chocolate and vanilla-marshmallow dominate, with virtually none of the Dark Lord roast showing.  The barrel comes through a little more than it does on the nose, but remains tertiary to the chocolate and sweet, scorched sugars.  In typical fashion, the mouthfeel is round, oily, and viscous, coating the mouth fully and leaving behind a lip smacking film.  Overall, this beer is tasty as hell.....in small doses.....when youre in the mood for dessert.  Hedonistically, it ranks way up there.

I was crestfallen a little earlier when I had heard that the Vanilla Dark Lord was gone; my only goal of the day besides getting my bottles and having fun with my pals was to try this.  Then someone nearby pointed out a guy who had a little bit left.  It was good timing because I had my Kate the Great bottle cracked open to share, so I ran over and bullied the guy into trading a pour for a pour.  He instead gave me what was left in the glass (maybe 2-3 ounces) and said he couldnt finish it and didnt care for any KTG.  Fine by me!  Granted, the bottom of his plastic cup sample wasnt ideal, but still a fantastic beer emerged.  Dark, opaque brown, with remnants of a brown head.  Big vanilla notes on top of the Dark Lords coffee, milk and dark chocolate, dark fruits, earthy notes, and molasses.  Im an absolute sucker for vanilla aromas but the flavor doesnt always match the sweet goodness; this was the case here, though not by a ton.

I thought the sweet vanilla detracted a little bit from the normal (and very sweet) Dark Lord, whereas the oak version adds a special element to it.  Dont get me wrong, this is amazing and needs to be tried; it just doesnt match the others. Re-Rate: Downgrading this a little bit after trying 347/934 of the 2012 series, the most sober Ive been when I tried it. It had a very sweet candy note on the nose above vanilla, caramel, milk chocolate, molasses, and bourbon. Flavor of chocolate-covered cherries, vanilla, oak, caramel, and molasses. Full-bodied, with low carbonation and a sweet, smooth mouthfeel. Great, but not as good as I remembered.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3440,"2010-05-02",4.6,"Served on tap at the FFF brewpub on DLD. First beer of the day. I was fortunate enough to get a seat at the bar to sample the 2 big one-offs. The vanilla bean poured a  midnight black with glowing ruby edges. There was no real head (This were being pre-poured so any head that was there had not lasted.) Aromas ooze out of the glass with rich vanilla beams, rich roasted malts, chard barrel, Italian roast coffee, figs, prunes. etc, etc... The flavors are as wonderfully complex.  Loads of rich roasted malts with a suitcase full of amazing flavors notes including a solid dose of vanilla bean, oak barrels, mocha, chocolate covered raisins, light notes of cigar. The mouth is obviously full bodied, rich and velvety but doesnt have any over powering alcohol burn like the oak aged.  A true treat and worth the trip from SoCal.","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"
3440,"2010-05-02",2.6,"I got to taste a couple of sample pours while standing in line at DLD thanks to the friendly folks in Columbus who were able to get a couple of full cups out of the brewpub. Re-poured into a 4 ounce tasting glass.
Milky off black color. Beer still had a thin brown collar around the rim.
Tons of Vanilla, boozy alcohol and very sweet syrupy aromas. I took a couple of whiffs of this -- very pleasant on the nose. This tasted like a frozen ice cream drink with creme de cacao (such as a Brandy Alexander) that had melted. 
Very thick and rich, low carbonation. Mouthfeel was very much like melted milkshake -- certainly interesting but not what I want in a beer. Very chalky, chocolate finish. I realize drinkability is not the same as availability, but how drinkable can a beer be thats only available at one place for about 45 minutes a year, and then only in 3 ounce pours? I consider this a gimmicky beer -- if it were more readily available it would be something you would want to try once, but then move on to something that taste more like beer than a vanilla milkshake.","Miamisburg, Ohio, USA","chaz01"

Oily black with a small dark drown head.  The aroma of vanilla really came through for me with a flavor to match.  This beer is just absolutely HUGE.  Vanilla vanilla vanilla, with some boozy sweetness throughout.  I loved it, and Im very glad I got to try it, but it was so sweet Im not sure how much I could really drink in one sitting.

Fortuitously ended up in the pub as some of the first in, and managed to grab both of the special treatments and then a couch.  Then we parked ourselves there, leisurely ate and made our way through the tap list for the day before finally succumbing to the big tasting in the parking lot.  This was my second beer of the day (well, actually had this and the oaked side by side, just the second one I tried).  Pours jet black with a thin dense tan head, that sadly falls off too fast, but does come back with agitation.  Lightly floral plum notes up front.  Super sweet, and chewy.  Somewhat cloying.  Reminds me a bit of Southern Tiers Crème Brulee, but without the over the top artificial flavors, just the big pile of sweetness.  Boozy and sweet, tastes a lot like melted vanilla ice cream.  Maple syrup and sweet toffee candies on the finish.  A solid beer, but seems a shadow of the original, and not as good as the oaked treatment.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

Theres none of the harshness or green apple, more like a 1-2 year old bottle.  The vanilla beans really come through and taste distinctly fresh.

3440,"2010-04-24",4.3,"Tasted at Dark Lord Day 2010, out of a wee plastic cup instead of the recommended snifter.  This was incredibly thick beer.  More like molasses or a milkshake than beer, really.  Without a doubt, the thickest brew Ive ever tasted.  Get it yet?  Its freakin THICK!

The nose was very nice.  The vanilla comes through, here, but it is well complemented by the roast and chocolate flavors, as well as a fair smack-in-the-face from the alcohol.

Flavor was huge and bold.  Perhaps too much so?  The vanilla is very big in the flavor, perhaps to a fault.  Not bad, of course.  Just too much vanilla, in my opinion.  Then again, I""m not the biggest vanilla fan.  On a positive note, the use of real vanilla bean, rather than an extract or something else, really does make a difference, as the quality of the vanilla is notable.

Overall, a very big, very good beer.  For those who enjoy vanilla more than I, this could very well be paradise.  For me, it was a nice new way to try the Dark Lord.","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","WabashMan"

After a reminder of how amazing BA Dark Lord is I was able to finally get a pour of this fantastic gem.  It immediately fell into second place - I like the complexity of the regular BA version ever so slightly but this is also one of the most well rounded and rich beers out there.  It makes me want to go to Dark Lord Day not to get bottles but simply to get another pint of this.

Aroma / Appearance - Vanilla mixes in well with the smoke and chocolate to form a nose that is over the top.  Just a hair ever so slightly below its barrel aged counterpart this is still as close to perfection as you can get.

Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel was rich and coated every corner of the tongue and throat as I made my way back for a few sours to cap off the festival.  Vanilla, cigar ash, chocolate, and malt form a dangerous sipping beer.  The alcohol is warm on the back of the throat but not so much that I would not ask for a second pour given the chance.  This is what happens when you take an excellent beer and age it right.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3440,"2009-05-04",4.7,"On tap @ DLD 09. I liked this just a little bit more than the regular Dark Lord- while the vanilla bean sweetness overwhelmed some of the subtleties of the beer, it provided a solid backbone off of which the other flavors blended beautifully. In addition to the vanilla, I tasted a little more chocolate and less coffee in this version. The beers arent poured with the optimal head at DLD, so I cant quite comment on the appearance, but it doesnt seem to lose any of the viscosity, etc. from the regular DL. Again, considering how intense the beer was, I found it a lot more drinkable than expected- the abv is noticeable, but I would not have guessed at 14%; does a good job of masking that. The burn on the way down is more pronounced than in the DL and it ends with a syrupy fullness. Beautifully done. For an approximation that is more easily available, I recommend the Barrel-aged Old Rasputin, which manages to bring out similar vanilla bean flavors.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","noompa"
3440,"2009-05-02",4.6,"On tap at DLD 09. Pours a black body with a thin, creamy, dark brown head that leaves the glass with a dark oily lacing looking as if it had been stained by soy sauce. The aroma is damn near perfect. Huge sweet vanilla, but big milk chocolate as well. Lots of molasses, wood, bourbon, and floral qualities. Some soft coffee and roasts creep in more and more as this warms. This would be the perfect aroma if the hops were just a little more pronounced. Despite that, the aroma was awesome. The flavor, however, was as good as an Imp Stout gets IMO. A remarkable medley of tastes. Big vanilla, milk chocolate, wood, bourbon, and fat malts up front. Moves softly into a moderately roasty and bitter middle before finishing with an explosion of tastes. Much more of a noticeable roast and hop character balances out the big vanilla and cocoa flavors to perfection. The wood and bourbon accompany the flavors nicely and never dominate. Extremely well balanced and complex. Full bodied, smooth, and round with a lingering taste of every flavor. Overall, a phenomenal beer. Last years version was just a little too sweet, but this year, FFF hit it on the head. The vanilla is unquestionably distinguished, but never gets too sweet. Fantastic.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
3440,"2009-04-30",4.2,"Enjoyed at FFF pub on Dark Lord Day 09. Pours from the tap to a very brownish=black color with thin skim of a dark brown head that lingers thru mid-glass. Aroma is an overwhelmingly pleasant mix of vanilla, roasted nuts, chocolate and molasses, with just the right amount of the 14% alcohol. Mouthfeel is almost syrupy full, and the vanilla explodes in the taste. Nice, long warming finish. Didnt enjoy quite as much as the Bourbon Barrel aged DL, but a damn good beer.","Dacula, Georgia, USA","kimcgolf"
3440,"2009-04-28",5.0,"On Tap at DLD. OMG, this is ice cream. Seriously. Its absolutely amazing and it takes the original DL to whole nother level. A thick rich black pour with a brown head. This is the aroma I was hoping for from DL with the vanilla so much more prevalent. Super sweet vanilla flavor with chocolate, molasses, toffee, dark roasted malts and a fruit flavor - it all really opens up as the beer comes to room temperature. I could literally pour this over ice cream.","oak creek, Wisconsin, USA","Scoobs"
3440,"2009-04-28",4.7,"On tap at DLD 09, served into a goblet.  Holy cow! This aroma is nothing short of heavenly.  Fresh vanilla galore, creamy ice cream, bourbon and roasted bourbon wood, malted cocoa, coffee beans, subtle citrus undertones.  I didnt want to start drinking, it smelled so good.  Zero head from the pour.  Black.  A dark wood colored outer ring with some small stagnant carbonation bubbles.  As thick as it gets, and rather mysterious looking.  But really, upon sipping, how can a beer this big, be so smooth? A really unbelievable feel, super thick, leaving flavor everywhere.  Just great for sipping.  Aroma really did not lie about how this one would taste.  Quite similar actually, as the flavors feed off the aroma very well.  Vanilla syrup, roasted bourbon cream, the best black malts Ive ever had, a thick woody bitter to back up the sweetness of minor 3fs herbal and citrus.  The hop backing fits in with everything so well, making this a very well balanced beer.  Other notes of warm cocoa and roasted black coffee.  Sweet till the end, but its never too much like it was last year, with just the perfect amount of vanilla.  A decent amount better than the other two versions, this was probably the best imperial stout I have ever had.  Wonderful!","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"

Rich, complex aroma, with dark chocolate and espresso nicely complimented by vanilla. Vanilla adds nice highlights to the flavor; dark chocolate, dark fruit, oak and espresso add highlights to the palate. Huge body and smooth on the palate.

I always had a fear that this one would be cloyingly sweet and unpalatable, but the vanilla lifts the DL to a whole other level. No alcohol comes through at all.

Poured a thick viscous black with brown edges, nice tannish head that laces some. Aromas are potent, throwing oak and vanilla prominently, roasted malts, and a pleasant creaminess with the regular coffee and chocolate fare. A lot going on. Taste is similar, complex and enjoyable, full bodied and amazing. Sweet, yet bitter with light roast and not cloying. Sounds like they found just the right amount of beans for the barrel over the last year. Some light bourbon and oan, vanilla beans sweeten and make very pleasant. Takes away the edge, so to speak.

The Vanilla was very present up front and was noticeable immediately from the first sip. There was a thick mouth feel,very thick almost the consistency of drinking thick pear juice..Pitch black ,over due motor oil change black with a small dark tan quickly dissipated almost non existent head..The taste was awesome to say the least..I have never had anything like it and probably never will again. Surprisingly easy to drink ,but this one is a sipper for sure, just goes down leaving you wanting another. I did notice the pours coming from the bar were getting a little bigger as other cups and glassware came out..They started with 4-5oz pours and quickly started going to 6-8oz pours so I grabbed 2 to go for my buddies in line outside and shared with them
Might as well forget about putting this one on your want list it was a 1 barrel thing on that day and is gone..It was $6 a pour and if I had a bottle and the $ I could have probably filled a growler..But my $ was spoken for from the bottled Dark Lord..Long live the mid evil madness!","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","hrking"

Smells good, really good. The body was thick as all get out, it was tempered a bit by the oak, but the vanilla actually blew the pretense that this is anything close to a balanced beer. The vanilla reminded me of the woeful lack of attenuation and this beer was a sticky sweet mess that I could hardly drink. The flavor was vanilla dominated and it accentuated the high residual sugars, there was the rest of the typical DL flavors, but the vanilla was the straw that broke the camels back.

3440,"2008-05-12",5.0,"UPDATED: MAY 13, 2008 The closet thing to a perfect beer I have ever had. Flat out delicious in every possible way. Pours thick and heavy. So black that it stains the cup. No lacing. Aroma is yeaty and full of chcolate and vanilla, some bread, cherries, and candy as well. Richness everywhere, in the aroma and taste. This one is creamy as creamy can be, just incredibly smooth...thick, but never TOO thick, a perfect mouthfeel.  Flavor is fn delicious. Thick and chewey, with lots of roasted barley, vanilla, chocolate covered cherries, cocoa powder, oak, and yeast, also notes of coffee. Some dark fruit and syrup notes as well. Roasted malts make themselves known at times, but the vanilla and chocolate covered cherries pack the punch. Alcohol is present, but doesnt feel like 14% whatsoever, but everything else is bold, yet smooth and totally drinkable. Flavors swirl in your mouth and are constantly changing, even the same mouthful will evolve before you swallow. The vanilla is always present, but only adds complexity and flavor, it never dominates. Very warming, but never at the expense of the brew itself. Everything strikes a great balance in getting the beer to feel and taste exactly as it should. This one is thick, oily, and bold. The vanilla beans are the PERFECT compliment to DL, and should be an actual ingredient. This beer is like drinking heaven.","Indiana, USA","StFun"
3440,"2008-05-10",4.5,"Tasted this at DLD thanks to a fellow beer geek who patiently waited in line while we were sampling other beers.  Amazing aroma of roast malt, black cherries, oak of course and vanilla.  I didnt think I would be able to taste much difference between the Oak Aged DL and this one with the vanilla added, but I was pleasantly surprised.","Illinois, USA","mmhnto"
3440,"2008-05-07",4.5,"On tap during DLD, thanks Drewbeerme for saving me some.  Opaque black like regular dark lord with small, yet still there, burnt red-tan head, very much like regular DL but not as large.  Aroma is oak and bourbon with chocolate, roast, alc, and a surprising amount of vanilla.  Flavor is very much the same with sweetness, and a less pronounced vanilla flavor, yet anything based on DL is pretty great, right?  Full and chunky, creamy body.  When I found out they were making this beer several months ago I was a little sceptical how it would actually turn out, but it was surprisingly and I think that the vanilla added a very interesting note to this otherwise exceptional beer.","Grand Rapids/Chicago, Michigan, USA","xnoxhatex"

I didnt actually get that much vanilla at all - I think the barrel dominates.  However, it surely softens what is likely otherwise a very overpowering wooden blow.  I will also say this: probably the only Top 50 beer that I have since forgotten the taste of.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"

3440,"2008-05-03",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 19, 2010 Enjoyed on DLD 08 out of plastic cups that were stained with this thick viscious brew.  Black and thick with a beige head.  It doesnt get much thicker than this.  Rich strong delicious nose.  Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon roast.  The rich chocolates have a slight undertone of dried fruits and a touch of oak.  Thick sticky palate.  Rich chocoalte flavors where the dark fruits show themselves a little more.  Brown sugar, dark chocolate, raisins, dark fruit, and vanilla.  The beer coats my mouth and the rich bittersweet chocolates stay around after I swallow.  Really sweet but excellent. 9/5/9/5/17 = 4.5

3440,"2008-05-02",4.4,"On draft at the brewpub, on DLD 08; courtesy of csbosox. Pours jet black with virtually no head and an oily surface. The aroma is of big vanilla bean and moderate bourbon up front with chocolate, roast and alcohol behind. Full-bodied and chewy with a syrupy sweet finish and some alcohol warming in your chest. Sweet, roasted, chocolaty malt dances with a nice mellowing vanilla note that ties everything together. Again, its quite ""warming"" but in a great way. This is a very nice variation on the original.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"

Creamy, chocolately decadent flavor.  Very light carbonation, but enough.  Like dessert in a cup, but still somewhat balanced.  Less soy sauce like character in this one, which I liked.  My favorite version of DL.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"
3440,"2008-04-29",4.8,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2013 Draft... DLD 08... This beer rocks!... Pitch black ale with a small, creamy, light brown head. The aroma is a splendid intermingling of warm bourbon, luxurious vanilla, dark chocolate, light molasses and tobacco. Ultra full-bodied and velvety with a mineral oil mouthfeel and tingly carbonation. The flavor provides hearty gobs of sticky-sweet chocolate, vanilla and bourbon with a calming bitterness and woodsy undertone. The lengthy finish is rich, bittersweet and smooth. Even better than the original and oak barrel aged versions of Dark Lord!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3440,"2008-04-29",4.1,"Had a bunch of this at DLD because, besides my glass, a number of generous folk didnt want me to miss it, so I thankfully drank some more.  Very thick dark brown (in bright sunlight) body with a few stray bubbles in lieu of a head, this had an aroma of dark-doughed chocolate chip cookies with a generous splashing of vanilla extract, dark roasted malt & barley, anise, oak, alcohol, dark dried fruit, and hard nuts.  Very creamy in the mouth.  The flavor was thicker than the nose and chewy with tastes echoed from same.

Intense dried dark fruits and sweet vanilla and gooey chocolate in the aroma; sweet, viscous, and very pleasant.  Full, viscous mouthfeel: tons of dried dark fruits, toasty vanilla, oily chocolate and coffee.

Dark muddy color with a beige head.  Extremely viscous and syrup-like.  Aroma was very sweet - mainly vanilla & molasses.  Some underlying oak tannins and coffee, but it was tough to distinguish many complexities because of the overpowering sweetness.  Flavor is also very sweet - vanilla bean, molasses, oak, some chocolate and coffee.  Very sweet and sticky though.  The vanilla bean sweetness was too overdone for my taste and I really think they covered up a lot of the complexity and subtleties that the Oaked DL would offer by itself.

Bourbon undertones very present. Incredibly thick, black tar with a orange head and orange lacing glued to the side of my glass. Over the top, while at the same time balanced. Blown away.

Still, its Dark Lord.  Chocolate and more subdued coffee linger.  The mouthfeel is as thick as crude oil.  The most delightful part about this beer.  The nose matches the flavor well, only the whiskey is much stronger.  Alcohol sweet syrupy mess, but thats not necessarily a bad thing I suppose.  The vanilla makes the sweetness just a bit overloaded.  I dont think it measurably imrpoves this beer.  But it does make this beer, umm, different?  Still fun to try...

Dark dark brown and entirely opaque.  Smells like sexy vanilla, cacao, and hops.  Smooth and viscous on the palate, light carbonation.  Tastes like sexy vanilla, then dropping into raisins for a moment, then cacao and hops.  Superbly balanced.  Reasonably sweet at first then dropping into bitter chocolate and even more bitter and dryer hops.  More than a few ounces is too much.

Has some complex flavors including coffee, wood, roasted malts, and has a nice smooth finish with an alcohol touch like the other Dark Lord beers.  Only issue with this one is its too sweet upfront.
