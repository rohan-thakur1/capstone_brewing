Sample glass. 
The appearance was a pale orange color with no head and no lacing. 
The smell had a mostly sweet maltiness running about. No soapiness came in as I was slightly expecting it.
The taste was mainly malty sweet with an ample amount of a sweet aftertaste that bled into a semi - wet finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Carbonation seemed to somewhat restrained but still acceptable.
Overall, I say this was a pretty good English pale ale I would have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Pour is hazed orange copper with a smallish light tan head. Aroma has some faint fruit sweetness up front, followed quickly by toasted malt, and a hint of Crystal malt in there as well.  Taste is the bright sweetness up front, then a nice toasted maltiness finishing with a very slight roastiness.  Palate is medium bodied, lower carbonation level and a dry mineral finish.

A drinkable pale ale that, while not outstanding, felt more interesting than most of their lineup the night I visited.

I like:
Gentle spicy, citrusy hoppiness with considerable earthy background. No excess of acidity. Light-bodied and aimed at drinkability. Crisp body. Short-lasting, but effective bitterness.

I dislike:
Minimally toasted malts where it feels like it would be a fine match. Dull clear light amber body.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

How: Tap at brewpub (SmokeHouse location, AleHouse #2)
The look: Clear dark golden body with a small white head
In long: Nice rich malt profile for a Pale Ale.  Toasted malts were just enough caramelized to meet the leafy fruity hops.  Medium bitterness with a citrus skin flavour.  Well put together for sure but lacked the crisp freshness feel that makes me go wow! with a brewpub Pale Ale.

1915,"2006-07-19",3.5,"On tap @ the brewery 5/9/06, cask version:  Cloudy chesnut brown w/ a lasting cream colored head of tiny, tight foam.  Herbal hop aroma @ first w/ a light iced tea aroma.  Medium caramel malt balances hop aromas pretty well.  Lightly toasty malt, and highly fruity as well as a mis placed yeasty phenolic, like a Belgian pale ale.  Also a hint of nuttiness.  the Flavor starts off a bit sweet and becomes highly fruity and dries out toward the finish & aftertaste, but still remains lightly sweet.  Some light herbal hop mid palate, light bready yeast, and also a plum fruitiness from what seems to be the yeast. A mild bitterness finally starts to creep into the aftertaste about 1/2 way through the pint.  Low carbonation as expected from a cask, smooth, medium body, with a tiny touch of alcohol.  I like the beer, but it doesnt seem like a great pale ale, unless youre expecting a Belgian pale.  Im not sure where the phenolic and plum fruitiness comes from, but its a bit out of place for an American pale.

1915,"2005-10-28",3.7,"Actually, I headed out to the Smokehouse with the intent of trying the Hobgoblin for
my first Firkin Friday experience.  However, much to my regret, the bartender informed
me that I was about 2 hours 2 late.  Gahh!!  No one told me.   So I made the best of it,
and tried some of this from the cask.  The first thing I noticed as the brew was brought to
me, was the amazing cascade.  The tall frothy beige head is fully lasting.  The brew is a
cloudy dark honey amber.  The nose is open, fresh and clean.  Though softer than I would
expect from the style, notes of pine and spruce are present.  The warmth accompanies a
wonderful balance.  The finish though tame, does present some complexity.  The medium
to full body is creamy and soft.  The finish feels slightly astringent.  Would make quite the
session offering.Earlier Rating: 11/30/2003 Total Score: 4.2Pours a dark copper with ruby highlights.  The large frothy off white head is mostly lasting with fair lacing.

1915,"2002-02-10",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 24, 2003 11/21/2003 Cask: 
This version of Barley's Pale is dark copper with a very thin light beige head. Very thin lacing as well. The aroma is heady hops with a faint floral aspect lingering as well. Velvety smooth mouthfeel and seemingly low carbonation with a nice hops flavor throughout, along with a nice malt backbone. The finish is a little slick with a lasting hops bite. I like the regular version of this just a little better. 
2/10/2002 - Draught:  This Columbus classic is a nice rich copper color with a medium light beige head. Thin and slow lacing. Nice hoppy aroma along with a little malt and caramel. The flavor is rich hops throughout, with a bitter hops and fruit aftertaste. A good match with Barley's food. The only drawback is that I could not recommend this over the Columbus Pale Ale as far as locals go.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
