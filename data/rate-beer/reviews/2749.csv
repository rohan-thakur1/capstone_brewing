Creamy biscuit malt thread creeps in, on par with the cask version, before dumping the linger in a lager bunker. This weird palate sapping pasteurised finish doesnt totally spoil things, but Ive drank this for nearly ten years in many forms.

A Scottish craft lager, it looked fine, like a golden clear lager/pilsner should, the thin pure white head also typical of the style.

The Hallertau Hersbrücker, Styrian Goldings and Challenger hops dont give off much aroma, nor does whatever lager malt and lager yeast are. There is a slight hoppy smell, but not much.

Clean smelling and light on the nose but with a little work I can detect some corn, bitter hops and a very faint amount of grain along with a biscuit like aroma at the end.

Orangey amber colour with a white, foamy head that is about a couple of millimetres thick.

Corn and some floral, grassy hops this time leading to a pretty crisp taste. It has very little grain, some biscuit like flavour and a light buttery sweet flavour towards the end.

Medium bodied and quite smooth on the palate with a nice crisp, refreshing finish. This one is a treat in this department and I cant really fault it too much; excellent especially for the style.

A - Crisp, light gold with a slight orange hue. Thick, foamy white head with good retention and a fair amount of lacing left.

S - Full of hops smells. The more prominent being grapefruit and orange, but not far behind is a floral and a bit grassy smell. Very enticing and mouthwatering, really making me think its an IPA.

T - A lot of hop and bitter taste. Follows the nose, with citrus being the most prominent hop taste. Good amount of floral, tea and grassy hops as well. At the end of the sip, there is a bit of a malt finish along with some general bitterness.

M - Medium to light body with moderate carbonation and crisp.

D - Easy to drink and good flavors. Flavors dont kill the palate, and definitely build.

2749,"2006-03-05",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 15, 2006 Tasted 05/03/2006.  500ml bottle from Rumbles, Wellington.
Pours a very pale straw-gold, almost green-hued, that hints of wheat malt.  Thin white head diminishes quickly but leaves a thick lacing.  Lines of tiny effervescent tiny bubbles trail up the side of the glass.  First sniff reveals a minerally lager yeast.  The nose then opens up into a lovely hop dominated bouquet of passionfruit and lychees, with a faint, underlying, grainy sweetness.  Mildly sweet lager malt hits the mouth first and lingers all the way through.  Its followed closely by more of the hop hits - more tropical fruit, with a citrus edge, and a cedary bitterness through the middle to the clean finish.  Some slight yeasty notes near the end are the only negative but these are very faint.  Medium weight and carbonation lead to a slightly creamy mouthfeel.  Superb balance.  This lager is right up there with Emersons Pilsner.  Id certainly love to try it on cask.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","yalnikim"

Aroma is initially surprisingly moderate but nice and pleasant, improves as the beer warms up a little (started drinking it too cold), flowery and citrussy hops (Hersbrücker and Challenger), hints of honey too. Flavour is zesty and grapefruity, the hops dominate but there is also a sufficient malty base. Bitter aftertaste of grapefruit peel.
