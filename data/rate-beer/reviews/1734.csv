Misc.: No BOD 

Had a taster of this back in 2014 on a trip to Albuquerque at the La Cumbre Brewery and I remember really liking it. Passed on reviewing it on May 5 when I went to La Cumbre again, but picked up a can at an ABQ Trader Joes the final day. Hoping this one still holds up. 

Poured a golden, straw, hazy color with 1-to-2 fingers of gray, fizzy head, which dissipated rather quickly. A good deal of carbonated bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Poor wet lacing. Poor retention. (Sight - 3.25)

Smelled peppery spices, coriander, honey, banana, banana chips, cloves, vanilla and leathery notes. (Smell - 4.00)

Taste mostly followed the nose, getting banana, cloves, peppery spices, honey, coriander peel, hints of vanilla, some Circus Peanuts candy and green grapes. Very sweet. (Taste - 4.00) 

Light body. Oily-to-thin texture. Lively carbonation. Long, spicy finish. (Feel - 4.00)

This was just as good as I remember. A bit sweeter than I remember, but tasty nonetheless. (Overall - 4.00)

1734,"2016-03-25",3.0,"Can. Murky honeylike hue with a fizzy head that evaporates quickly. Aromas heavy on the phenolics: smoky clove, black pepper, a little adhesive. Flavor, too, could use more fruit presence, as clove covers soft banana, peardrop and dry, tannic wheat. Flashes with a dollop of malt sweetness before a dryn underwhelming finish. Not terrible for an American-made hef, but theres nothing here that brings it to the level of the classics of the style.","","PartyFowle"

1734,"2015-04-09",3.0,"4 pack of pint cans packaged on 2-23-15 from Dicks. Im drinking the last one today. This one has the same problem the other three cans had: very low carbonation. Sadly a hefeweizen is a style that really needs active carbonation to be enjoyable. The pour is pretty lifeless with no head formation and minimal bubbles in the cloudy orange body. Aroma is solid with pleasant suggestions of orange, banana, wheat bread and tasteful, subdued clove notes. The flavor is clean too with pleasant esters and a solid wheaty body. Fresh citrus is also here. But the low carbonation is very distracting. This is tantamount to drinking a very low carbed pilsner or geuze.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

1734,"2012-12-16",3.3,"10oz draft from La Cumbre; November 2012
The beer arrives with a hazy, orange-tinged straw color that is topped by a ¼-finger thick, pale head. The nose has lots of clove character to it, some tart wheat notes, as well as an expressive, floral character to it. Other notes of pepper and even some plum fruitiness come out as I dig into the aroma a bit.

The beer has a nice crispness to it up front and this is accentuated by a light hop bite. A banana note towards the finish melds into a hay like grain note in the long finish. This has a nice carbonic bite to it, which plays nicely with the light body, but there is enough heft here that it has some palate presence while remaining quite quaffable. A soft herbal flavor is here in the flavor, though it is not overly defined. The nose is really nice, though the flavor seems a bit washed out (though maybe the pulled pork sandwich I had affected this), but still this is quite nice in the end, and Ill have to have this again.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
