421,"2016-04-12",2.6,"This bottled brew from a rating party poured a small sized head of fine to medium sized off-white colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a no visible carbonation semi-opaque dark red brown colored body. The complex aroma was malty and orange. The mouth feel was tingly at the start with a mediumly tingly finish with a medium fruity aftertaste. The strange flavor contained notes of orange sweet and hops. Not one that I would likely drink again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
421,"2015-11-27",4.4,"Maple grapefruit smell...great smell and great strength! Orange/citrus taste is prominent, smooth beer and medium sweetness, very bold on the flavor but not overwhelming...very nice","Columbia, South Carolina, USA","geologyguy"
421,"2015-03-05",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 6, 2015 Can. Pours reddish amber tan head. Nose/taste of Russell Stovers orange cream candy (as suggested by Frank) - orange cream, vanilla, chocolate and caramel/maple. Medium body. I really liked this. Would love to drink more of it.",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
421,"2015-03-04",3.5,"Can. Brown pour no real head. Maple, oranges and sweet cream aromas. Oranges and chocolate, light maple flavors. Nice in small doses, not sure how long I could drink this for.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"

421,"2014-09-14",3.4,"12oz can to Packers snifter. Deep cloudy orange brown with thick light tan head. Huge sweet orange dominant aroma. Nice creamy maple flavor with orange on the finish.","Erin, Wisconsin, USA","demmbonz"
421,"2014-09-14",2.9,"12 ounce can. Pours reddish brown with a small beige head. Big aroma of maple syrup with some citrus and caramel. Taste is maple syrup, orange, and caramel. Maple syrup dominates this very sweet brew. Interesting.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
421,"2014-09-12",3.3,"Tallahassee, Fl - ABC Fine Wine & Spirits - Betton - 12 oz can that looks like it was designed in Computer Graphics 101. Aroma is enticingly enjoyable with some maple sugar candy notes with some orange candy slice notes. Flavor has the same candy orange and maple candy sweetness, just a hint of chocolate and some confectioners sugar. Mouthfeel has a decent thick texture to it. Decent novelty, but glad it was only 12 oz, a bomber would have been verging into cloying territory.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
421,"2014-09-07",3.3,"A really exciting beer, but it falls short for me. The orange and maple come through perfectly but create a sweetness that is a touch overwhelming. Not as good as the base Caramel Cream Ale, but an interesting beer that I could see being great with some tuning on the sweetness.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
421,"2014-09-05",3.3,"Nutty, pecan-maple, vanilla toffee aroma. Bad can, darkish brown, foggy. Fluffy, whitish head. Fairly bitter, lightly sweet, marzipan maple, orange and vanilla notes. Aroma promised more than the flavor delivered. A bit more acidic than I expected -the caramel cream had the same issue. A little astringent in the finish. ABC Liquors, Betton.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"
421,"2014-09-04",3.0,"Like pure maple syrup in a can. Orange peel and sugar makes this VERY sweet. Body is on the light side. Too sweet to drink much of.","LAS VEGAS, Nevada, USA","kathouse"
421,"2014-09-04",3.8,"Wow awesome aromas of sweet orange peel, maple syrup and some cocoa. Pours a mahogany wood color. Taste is some bitterness up front which moves into the maple and biscuity malt. The orange flows nicely at the end. The mouthfeel was a little bubbly light. A little more thicker and richer texture would have knocked it out of the park. Well done.","Florida, USA","Weezel"
421,"2014-08-31",2.0,"Hazy amber, confected orange maple aroma smells like a gross doughnut. Baby aspirin notes. Medium thick bodied, sweet caramel flavor is less bothersome than the maple and incongruous orange. Slick alcohol mouthfeel. A bad idea not horribly executed? T. Hanks, Homer!","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
421,"2014-08-26",4.1,"Huge maple aroma up front. Maple flavor hits you right of the top with hints of orange on the backside. Reddish copper color with some lacing but a quickly diminishing head. The longer you drink it the less maple and more orange flavor comes through. Virtually no alcohol flavor despite the the 8% ABV. Two thumbs up and Im more of a hop head than a sweet beer guy.","","BrianG2"
421,"2014-08-18",2.9,"Tap. Moderate roasted grain, cereal and coffee for the malt, light herbs and medium soap for the hops and yeast, with maple syrup and a heavy dose of orange household cleaner. Head iis small, frothy, off-white with slippery lacing and good legs and is mostly diminishing. Color is clear orangey brown. Flavor starts moderately sweet and lightly to moderately acidic, then the long finish is lightly sweet and acidic and heavily bitter. Palate is on the fuller side of medium, slick with a lively carbonation, and finishes heavily astringent and sticky. Im not sure the adjuncts in this Cream Ale are just a little over the top.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"
421,"2014-04-12",4.1,"Poured a dark amber orange color with huge aromas of maple syrup, light oranges and more maple. Flavors are maple syrup up front light pancakes and a touch of orange. Really great beer from these guys and should bottle this.","Florida, USA","burg326"
