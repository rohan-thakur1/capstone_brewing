Head is initially small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is light to medium yellow. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted bread), lightly to moderately hoppy (honeysuckle flowers, herbs).

A very enjoyable nose on this one, very German without any American give-aways. Doesnt excel quite as much in the other departments, being a little watery and lacking in head retention and less than lip-smacking (but still well-balanced), but its a really nice quaffer that holds up to a lot of authentic Franconian lagers (and is better than plenty of them too).

2820,"2014-05-23",3.3,"Transfer from BA review on 3-21-12 - 
Served in 10 oz chalice glass

Appearance  Served a hazy yellow color with a large white head that faded fast. Upon fading a little lacing was left on the glass.

Smell  The smell is more citrus hop with a nice bit of wheaty bready aroma mixed with a pepper spicy aroma and an ever so lighter tropical fruit aroma. 

Taste  The taste is a bit of sweeter wheat malt up front. The hop flavor really then starts to come into play. Very lemony citrus in nature with a bit of pine. There is a nice peppery flavor that comes more toward the end of the taste. The mix of the peppery lemon and wheat go on to take the brew to its taste finish and leave a rather crisp flavor on the tongue as an aftertaste.

Mouthfeel  The mouthfeel is on the medium to lighter side with a good level of carbonation. It is rather good for the style, but nothing of extraordinary greatness.

Overall  This was a refreshing brew that was very easy to drink. Good for a nice sunny warm day while sitting and lounging around outside.","","Darkmagus82"

2820,"2014-03-06",3.8,"Drier and crisper than a Bohemian Pilsener with a bitterness that tends to linger more in the aftertaste due to higher attenuation and higher-sulfate water. Lighter in body and color, and with higher carbonation than a Bohemian Pilsener. Modern examples of German Pilsners tend to become paler in color, drier in finish, and more bitter as you move from South to North in Germany.

2820,"2014-03-04",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
A herbal hop zing pierces this Kellerbiers wet hay, as whispers of citrus fruit and honey create even more merriment.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy sheet of foam covers the hazy straw, lacing beautifully.
-If I have to find something to improve, I could say the body could be drier.
-The nose is surprisingly awash in malt aromas.
-This is not as slender and elegant as many German Pilsener, which is why I dubbed it a Kellerbier. Feels more rural in its intensity and flavor display.

2820,"2011-11-16",4.1,"Draft at Rattle N Hum.  Oh yeah.  This shit rocks!  Im a huge Prima Pils fan, so finding this little gem on tap was a pleasant surprise.  The body is a cloudy, glowing, rich golden color.  A minimal head of smooth, off-white foam settles quickly to a thin ring, leaving virtually no lace behind.  The first sniff reveals exactly what I was hoping for....super fresh, doughy, malty, hoppy deliciousness!  Notes of fresh, softly sweet, ultra yeasty bread dough lay the baseline.  From there, a mildly eggy and sulfuric undertone nods to the ungespundet beers of Bamberg.  Grassy noble hops lend the right amount of dry, peppery bite to balance the nose.  It simple smells comfortable and inviting, fresh and quaffable, better than 99% of the Pils made domestically.  Flavors follow suit, delectably balanced, showing the perfect ratio of sweet dough and bitter grass, with that eggy, yeasty twang that I rarely get to experience.  Pepper and grass grow on the finish, letting you know that this is indeed a relative of Prima Pils, but there is more restraint shown here than in its big brother.  I cant say anything negative about the palate, as the even-keeled body sports a cleaning, zippy carbonation that leaves the mouth slightly dry, begging for the next glass.  I crushed pint after pint after pint of this stuff, and was perfectly happy to do so.  Excellent beer.  Victory knows Pils!","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Earthy aroma with subtle floral hops, grass and straw as well as a prominent malt presence that wasnt expected. Pilsner malt with hints of subtle biscuit, tofee and caramel in the nose.

Medium bodied with more of a malt presence than expected for the style. Earthy and crisp with floral hop bitterness and a nice dry character that lingers throughout into a sweet yet dry finish.

An expertly crafted beer and incredibly refreshing.","New York, USA","Chronoflash"

2820,"2010-05-23",3.7,"Growler purchased from Bierkraft in Brooklyn.

Appearance: Pours an attractive soft golden yellow with a slight cloudiness to it. 2 fingers of soft foam crown this pils.

Smell: Nice subdued hoppiness (almost like a fresh hop ale) and grass notes. Im impressed by how fresh the hops smell.

Taste: Large fresh hop presence with some bitterness. Lots of wet grass to balance out the typical pilsner malt. Truly a tasty pilsner.

Mouthfeel: Amazingly crisp and creamy at the same time!

Drinkability: No problems kicking this one back all night. A really nice session beer choice for those who like hops.

2820,"2010-05-20",3.4,"Growler, from Consumers Beverage (yes, Im drinking the WHOLE growler).  Boy, that previous rater should give himself an enema (preferably boiling lead) - 0.8 because its too hoppy?  Maybe I should go and re-rate all my DUTCH beers to 0.7 - 0.9 because theyre TOO FUCKING DUTCH.  Jesus.  Anyway, pours a somewhat flat-looking, oily gold, mostly clear, with a small fast-diminishing white head (2+).  Not a lot of aroma to it - slightly sweet, a nice fresh clover grassiness (6+).  The taste - not terribly hoppy (DutchDude:  were you comparing this to bottled water, you pussy-palated weenbag?) - its grassy, slightly catty, with just enough sweet grainy malt and vague fruity yeastiness to sort of balance it - hardly any alcohol presence at all.  Still, slick, slightly thick mouthfeel - it initially seems like it may amount to some sessionable hoppiness, but it just fades into a slightly tangy grassy-grainy mildness.  Drinkable, but not all that interesting - now if this IS a zwickel, that might explain the slightly earthy aftertaste.  Mehh.  (call me wrong - Im NOT rating this 0.8).  UPDATE - two pints into this growler, and man has it grown on me - Im bumping the taste+1 and the overall +2 - subtle, and a real dry earthiness to it.

2820,"2008-03-24",3.8,"Draught at Bar Great Harry.  Poured a pretty looking hazy to lightly cloudy yellow/gold with a frothy white head, leaving sheets of lacing.  Floral, citrus and grassy hops in the aroma which blend with the underlying malts into a nectary/honey character.  Flavor of smooth biscuity malts with a nice slightly resiny citrus hop rub on the tongue. Full unfiltered mouthfeel.  As a hophead who enjoys unfiltered ales, this is my ideal lager.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","sheatripper"

2820,"2008-03-22",3.6,"Hazy golden pour with an inch of snow white head. Lemon hop aroma, very sweet and citrusy with a few earthy hints. Flavors match the aromas. Very citrusy with a little fruit at first with a well balanced hop finish. Leaves the perfect bitter sensation!","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","DocHop"
2820,"2007-08-21",4.0,"Tap at Pizzeria Paradiso.  Cool, still blonde pour with a lasting whitecap.  Ripe peach and dry apricot aroma with an earthy touch of sweetcorn.  A little papery, but super bitter and fresh.  Wet hops lend a lovely sagebrush and grassy bitterness which wraps itself in a slow, long caress around a candy malt center.  This smacks a bit of almond and toffee sweetness.  The malt seems dirty with earthtones and crisply clean at once.  Finishes dry with a hit of Saaz.  A serious, professional pils.  With style.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

2820,"2007-07-12",3.4,"Draught:  Very slight floral hop aroma.  You could barely smell anything it was so faint.  Poured golden in color with a medium-sized, rocky, white head that lasted pretty much throughout.  Very good lacing.  Hazy.  Sparkling.  Flavor is quite bitter.  Tastes hoppy with Pils malts, hops, and a fruit I cannot identify, but with a earthy horseblanket and funk backbone.  Light to medium body.  Sticky texture.  Lively carbonation.  Short, bitter finish.  Overall, fresh and tasty, but quite earthy.  A nice way to get into this style of Lager.","King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA","michael-pollack"
2820,"2007-07-11",3.4,"Draft at Tria. Advertised on the menu as ""VICTORY BRAUMEISTER SESSION PILS"" with 4.7% ABV. Hazy straw color, with a moderate sized off-white head. Very subdued malt aroma with mild hops and some grassy notes. Crisp, floral hop flavor with some honey and fruit; i got a slight hint of raspberry jam along with the hops. Finish is a bit earthy. Overall, very drinkable. It really hit the spot on a hot Philly evening.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","kkearn"

2820,"2007-05-21",3.7,"Golden color - aroma is bready with some pleasant citrus notes.  Taste was heavy on the citrus with a nice pils malt and subtle Saaz hop flavor.  Still prefer the fresh hop version, but I still say Victory makes the best Pilses in the US.","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"
2820,"2007-05-19",3.5,"Draft - Hop Devil Grill - Lightly hazed gold, fizzy white head.  Bready nose warms to further notes of lemon rind, citrus, and hints of pepper.  Well balanced between the lemon zest, light yeast, and peppered citrus.  LIght to medium bodied, soft carbonation, dry fruity finish.  Could pound these all day...","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"

2820,"2007-04-03",3.5,"Im pretty sure this is the braumeister that I tried, and not the harvest pils.  anyway very light in colour, body was good, had a nice hop to it towards the end and a bit of a citrus bite.","Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, USA","Nejhleader"

2820,"2007-04-01",4.1,"Draft at HDG. Cloudy yellow with a small but durable head. Aroma is nice sweet malts with Saaz. Nice and bready taste with a nice, dry finish. This is an awesome brew and IMHO a tad better then Prima.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
2820,"2007-03-30",3.3,"Sampled at Issacs with Stegosaurus. Golden Pour with thin white head. Barely any aroma but a mild hop presence is detected(Very Mild) Slight citrus/ floral taste. A little bland and a little thin for my taste but not horrible.","Levittown, Pennsylvania, USA","MadIndian"
2820,"2007-01-27",3.8,"On tap at the mellow mushroom in Charlotte. Pours out a murky yellow with a big white head. Smell is very nice of subdued hops and some startchy aroma that was very pleasing. Taste is heavier than expected than expected but still clean. I liked this alot. Mouthfeel is thicker than one would think as well and lets you know that there is something to this beer. Flavor hops and bittering hops come well together and the carbonation seemed just about perfect. Definatley would have this again.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","rayg1"
2820,"2006-12-22",3.7,"On tap at the mellow mushroom in Charlotte.  Pours out a bright yellow color with a huge thick white head on it.  Smell is hops, bread, some wheat? and plenty of malts.  Taste is sweet but not as crisp and refreshing as prima pils is.  Pretty thick in most ways, interesting, and my first of this style.  This would probably be pretty good in the middle of the summer.  Not bad","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"
2820,"2006-10-15",3.2,"Grassy hopped aroma smells just as it tastes, but with a bready flat flavor beneath  the bitterness.  Not my favorite style, but certainly a reasonable example thereof.","portland, Oregon, USA","Arayaga2"
2820,"2006-08-01",3.4,"Tasty pils, full bodied at 5.5%, and not as crisp as the prima.  This is more of a thick pilsener and here is called a landbier, which makes sense, more lagerish than pils-ish.","Madrid, SPAIN","CamdenD"

2820,"2006-06-10",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2006 Sampled from growler.   Im starting to realize that a fresh Pilsner is one heck of a beer. After having so many that have been anything less than fresh it is beers like this that are making me enjoy the style more and more.  Pours a lightly hazy golden straw with an average foamy white head that left spotty lacing.  Aroma of pilsner malts, grains, grass, floral hops and lemon.  Flavor is crisp, clean and refreshing...bitter hop presence up front, grass, malts, some grapefruit and grains.  Very well done Pilsner.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
2820,"2006-02-19",3.4,"On tap at Victory. Poured a medium golden color with a smaller sized white head. Aromas of grass with some malts. Tastes of the same. I have to wonder if some of the hoppiness is starting to fade as I found both the aromas and tastes on the mellow side. Creamy body that went down very easy.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
2820,"2005-05-06",3.9,"Tap. Really good Pilsner.  Good golden color, could use more sparkle.  Malty taste with some hops as well.  The malts are really effective in the taste.  This is a spectacular Pilsner in my opinion.  Might be my favorite one to date.","Princeton, New Jersey, USA","wnhay"

2820,"2005-03-26",3.5,"On tap at Victory.  Solid pilsner, which is hard for me to say.  Usually this style is exceptionally boring, but this one, surprisingly, had quite a bit going on.  Good bitterness for a pils.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Jonathan3584"

This was a nice pils. Been a long time since I had a good one. Dry, nice bitterness, It had a Hallertauer type hop flavor and bitterness ( Probably Saaz though). Very clean, fresh, and a bit nippy w a pleasant crisp sharpness. Nicely balanced with enough malt to back up the hops. Very refreshing.","Coeur dAlene, Idaho, USA","billk"

Tastes malty, with some hops, and a nice, honey malt sweetness at the finish, while retaining a smooth, crisp finish.  For my money this one is more flavorful than Prima Pils.  Nice balance and super complexity.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
2820,"2004-07-30",3.4,"On tap at the brewery.  Grainy aroma with a sour hoppiness in there.  This is interesting.  Transparent applejuice color with a small white head.  Tangy start bittering into quite a hoppy finish.  Seems a little overhopped, but I guess this particular type of pils is supposed to be hoppy.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

2820,"2004-07-15",3.9,"Poured a hazy golden color with a small white head and very light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of citrus hops, grass and lemon as well.  Light lemony taste, some citrus hops, and lightly tart, very earthy finish.  The only thing I did not like was the relatively strange earthy aftertaste, could have been a little fruitier.  Light carbonation.  A nice Keller pils, though I think I enjoy Sly Foxs better.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
