2216,"2011-03-07",3.7,"I can tell you this is not the time Im usually divulging into this style, but hey it IS the Capital Brewery summer seasonal, yes summer. It comes in a 12 oz twist-off bottle (still dont know why Capital doesnt have the pry-off).

It pours into my mug a decent light amber/caramel/golden color with a foamy, white head that dissipated pretty luckily leaving no lace.

The smell is like a lot of American Oktos, malty with a sense of almost cola in the scent but with a distinctly more German flair. The malts are malty and springy.

The taste has a boat load of saltine cracker like grain with some nuttiness but not a ton. The hops leave a leveling bitterness which works nicely. It is a bit lighter and waterier than most in a way, but in a good way. The hops seem different here than in most oktoberfest beers.

Overall this is a good depiction of the style, slightly altered.

2216,"2010-06-18",3.8,"If memory serves me correctly, only 50 ratings ago I made note and I quote ""I hope someday soon Capital beer comes back to Iowa. I miss it."" How grateful I was to find three varieties of Capital beer in a local shop today. It seems as though luck has shined upon us here in downtown Des Moines. The beer pours just a shade darker than deep golden heading in the orange territory but not quite there yet. The head is big, full, tight, billowy, and leaves a nice enough although somewhat spotty lace. The aroma is classic Märzen in every respect. That dominant mildly roasty mildly caramelized, primarily grainy and fresh maltiness. Of course coupled with those perfect herbal and earthy hoppy notes. Something about this aroma seems rustic and rural. The sorts of aromas you catch on a breezy day on a country drive. The flavor is richly malty and well balanced with plenty of herbal hoppiness. Each sip begs you almost do the palate double take. It starts off with a fruity and bright malt character with some deep notes of roastiness and some mild caramel. About the time you are to declare this a rich malty beer the hops just kick right into gear with that nice unforgiving type of bitterness and the awesome herbal notes of bitter herbs and horehound. I will admit it took me a bottle and a half to feel as strongly as I do about this beauty, but it was well worth the effort.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

Somewhat floral and fruity up front with some pale malt sweetness and a touch of caramel. I get just a pinch of toast with a somewhat bready malt in there too.

2216,"2007-07-27",3.6,"7/27/2007:  Capital Fest Beer is extremely pale amber (more like a golden/light orange) in color with a frothy off-white head.  It is very clear with a moderate+ level of carbonation.  When did Oktoberfest beers become so light and fizzy in appearance?!  The aroma has a slightly European maltiness to it that is overshadowed by honey (actually, the honey seems to disappear as the beer warms up a little bit).  Again, it just doesnt seem quite right for an Oktoberfest beer...  Well, the appeance and aroma might be slightly off to me, the the flavor is pretty close!  Very malty and smooth with flavors of toasted malt, biscuit, and a hint of that smooth and tasty European lager characteristic.  It finishes clean and slightly with a noticeable noble hop presence.  Very nice.  The body of this beer is medium-light to medium and appropriate for the style.  The taste of this beer has rekindled memories of Oktoberfest in Muchich and restored my interest in what seems to be a style that has long since morphed from what it used to be...

2216,"2005-05-26",3.2,"UPDATED: JUN 28, 2005 A festive beer that is a jumble of tastes, textures, and tinges of an assortment of different styles.  Nose is swampy and fruity, and this translates in taste to flavors of cantaloupe, yeast, roasted corn, and apricot, all with a buttery mouthfel.  These flavors fade to a general spiciness, which in turn gives way to a creamy, caramel malt.  The malt isnt quite sweet... candy-sour and funky are the best words, I suppose.  The aftertaste is light, but lingering, a watery swill-brew taste.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","Gurst"

Typical malt-hop imbalance aroma, slightly acrid, not a good balance overall. Flavor is buttery (more precisely ""like margarine"", but American Midwesterners will refer to margarine as butter so I suppose I may as well). The imbalance continues but the hops seem to win out, allowing compromised elements of honey and corn flakes to show. This brewery puts out much better -- maybe I got a bad bottle, Im going to try again from another source and update this rating if necessary.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","BeerAteHer"

A bold golden brown color with a smallest white head.  A strong caramel malt aroma with an almost meadow like grass background.  A slightly sweet taste with a grassy hop flavor that finely balances this beer.  Alot of body and taste in what many consider an inferior style.  This brewery knows what they are doing.","USA","kane"

In both the flavor and the nose, its malty, bready, toasty and slightly caramely, but also a bit too sugary sweet as well, which is what Im less enthused about.  Medium bodied and nicely carbonated.  Light golden amber in color and slightly hazy in appearance.  The off-white head is pretty small initially, and fades to a small rim fairly quickly, leaving on a few dots of lace on the glass.

Also, because its from a growler, not much in the way of bubbles, but still a good fizziness. A very well malted Okto flavor leaving some stickiness, and well-matched hops.

The light copper hue was topped by a small but tight head and good lace was produced. Aroma hinted of caramel malts, apples, butterscotch, and floral hops. Some hint of vanilla and smoke also detected on the nose. The taste was heavy malty sweey at the start but a refreshing hoppy twang and sour fruit tone came through midway.

2216,"2002-07-21",3.8,"Now were getting somewhere. Part of the Capital Summer Sampler, this is a really good seasonal. Dark amber with decent lace. Nice honey and nutty aroma. Tastes kind of like a Marzen with a malt flavor and light caramel finish. I will look for this one next summer.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
2216,"2002-07-18",3.6,"The beer poured a copper amber color and formed an amazing off white foamy head that left some nice lace. An aroma of hops and spices like clove. It had a taste of hops, caramel and clove. Almost reminded more of a specilty or brown ale style. Thats what makes there non-description of this beer confusing. I am not sure what its trying to be. Not a bad beer though.","Ohio, USA","Gunshy"
2216,"2002-07-09",4.2,"Very attractive beer from the tap: appropriately dry, very flavorful, and a rich body that complements its heritage. Perhaps a little too much on the yeasty side, but I quibble.","USA","beerlovinman99"

2216,"2002-06-25",4.0,"Frothy white foam with decent stick but great retention.  Amber liquid.  The very clean aroma boasts honey, toastiness, yeastiness, and fruitiness.  Flavors lean toward sweetness, with spices being displayed wonderfully.  This could suffice as another Maibock.  These guys continue to impress me with their very straightforward philosophy, yet unprecedented lager/ale creating knack.  Well done, Capital.  I am not so sure this is an ale.  This brewery really erks me, however.  They offer no information, other than the name of the beer, not the style.  What on Earth is a Fest?!!  They also have the most unattractive labels I have yet seen.  The label shows a CapitOl, not a CapitAl.  Confusing, to me.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2216,"2002-05-08",4.1,"2002 Version. A much better effort than in the last few years.  Maibock maltiness with a slightly more aggressive hop schedule. Golden colored.  NIce smooth feel.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
