Sporo firanek pozostaje na ściankach, jak również kilkumilimetrowa obrączka.
Zapach : Zbożowy, słodowy, chmielowy. Wszystkiego po trochu. W aromacie śliwki, rodzynki, winogrona i toffi. 
Smak: W smaku estry owocowe. Głównie ciemne owoce. Trochę śliwek, moreli i rodzynki.

Bardzo ciekawy dubbel z interesującym profilem smakowym. Od zbożowego, przez słodowy na chmielowym skończywszy.

The aroma is candi sugar at first, then rather quickly softening to more malty and toasty, with notes of dark (dried) fruits and bitter forest berries, with a spicier (kind of herbal, grassy) side also opening up. Pine needles, too, perhaps. And a hint of cinnamon at times? Tastes caramelly-toasty-roasty, nutty, moderate sweet with a bit of herbal and berry-like bitterness following. Also, at times the tiny sweetness of cinnamon. Body lightish to medium; very crisp carbonation, which prevents it from any stickiness that Id associate with the caramelly character.

Originally a near-alias of Bornem Dubbel, it has developed its own character since production moved from Van Steenberge to Du Bocq. This rating is based on old notes when it was still brewed at Van Steenberge; in that shape, it was a dark bronze beer with a very thick and frothy, pale yellowish beige head and malt sweet flavour, caramelly and a tad chocolatey, with some dried fruits, estery, a bit metallic, candi syrup, yeasty and drying finish with some brandy-like alcohol and herbal hops.

563,"2014-06-09",4.2,"Transfer from BA review on 4-14-12 - 
Poured from 750 ml bottle into snifter glass 

Appearance  Pours a hazy dark brown color with a medium tan head. The head has a moderate persistence but eventually fades to give some lacing.

Smell  The smell is bready and yeasty with strong dark fruit aromas. There are some lighter hints of banana, brown sugar and spice as well, mixing with the fruit and bread very nicely.

Taste- The taste is up front of brown sugar and dark malt; a nice brown bready flavor. There is a development of the dark fruit flavors mixed with some banana and spice more toward the middle of the taste. Theses linger on to the end where they mix with a yeast cake flavor which when mixed with the dark bread of the initial taste is very pleasurable.

Mouthfeel  The brew has a medium body with a slightly above average carbonation level. While the carbonation is a bit too high, as it takes a bit out of the smoothness, overall the mouthfeel is still not bad.

Overall  This is a good easy sipping dubbel. Good malty and fruity flavors make for a very pleasing experience.","","Darkmagus82"

563,"2012-10-28",3.8,"11.2oz Bottle. The pour was a muddy dark brown with a nice reddish hue around the edges and an average (1-2 finger) tan creamy head that had great retention pretty much lasting throughout, thus creating some excellent sheets of sticky lacing.

The aroma starts with a roasted sweet bread malt and moves on with an earthy somewhat leathery yeast. In the back ground I sensed notes of milk chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, some dark fruit (raisons and figs), a hint of smoke and a mild winey alcohol presence.

The taste started with a nice malty sweetness and had hints of chocolate and brown sugar, progressing with a good bit of dark fruit and a slight alcohol finish. The flavor had a decent duration following the swallow with a sweet fruity taste fading as a mild creamy chocolate alcohol flavor settled on the taste buds.

Mouthfeel was a strong medium in body with an extremely smooth and creamy texture and an almost flat carbonation.

Overall this was an exquisite tasting brew, one that possessed a nice sweet malty taste with a really intense creamy feel. This hid the moderately high ABV extremely well and made a pleasure to consume...","Macon, North Carolina, USA","KajII"

563,"2012-10-12",3.6,"Dark brown body crowned by an everlasting, creamy, light-brown head that sticks to the glass. The aroma isnt very strong at all, so I spend some time to lure out all the complex aromas: sweet dark dried fruits, raisins, plum (actually a bit plum in madeira), sugar, some yeast and even some faint hoppy notes. The taste is moderate to light sweet with a very light bitter finish that unfortunately is a bit short. The flavours are as humble as the aroma, but again quite complex and very nice. There is the regular malty backbone with dark dried fruits, but addition to this there is a refreshing and crisp citric part with additional fresh fruits. Medium body with a surprisingly watery texture for the style, although it also has a certain creamy feel. The finish also has a very light dryness. A very nice dubbel that isnt too sweet, and the citrus makes all the difference.

Aroma: The nose is dark malts, some wine-like fruitiness, chocolate, Belgian yeast, other fruity esters

Appearance: A dark brown pour with a large foamy light brown head that leaves a disappearing sheet of lace on the glass

Palate: It has a medium body, with a smooth and slick mouthfeel that turns slightly sticky in the end palate

563,"2010-05-10",4.0,"Bottle.

A - Dark mahogany with a deep ruby hue on the edges. Slightly above average sized, bubbly and foamy off-white, nearing beige head. Decent retention that settles in a thin bubbly layer of lace with thicker patches on the sides.

S - A lot of dark candi sugar and Belgian yeast. Some dark fruit, with it being more on the side of juicy and plum like with a good amount of raisin and some citrus as well. Fairly well spiced (spicy with a peppery and ginger aroma dominating) and a touch of licorice.

T - Starts with a mild background base of dark malt along with a strong dark fruit taste. Similar to the nose, the dark fruit included plum, raisin, and a touch of date/prune. Mid sip, some more dark candi sugar and yeast comes out along with a touch of citrus, licorice, and earthiness. Finishes with those flavors in the background and the dark fruits coming out a bit more. Also a bit of mineral taste comes out. All the flavors are a touch muted and thin however.

M - Medium (maybe a touch on the thin side) body and a bit above average carbonation. Quite smooth and just a little creamy and bubbly.

D - Well balanced flavors with a very smooth body make it very easy to drink. The slight thinness makes it pretty easy to drink too.

Notes: A touch thin and muted flavors (especially for what I was expecting). However, there is a good diversity of traditional Dubbel flavors that are balanced pretty well. Overall, a decent beer that is worth a try if you find it for a good price, but its not worth seeking out and I dont know if I will get it again as there are some other Dubbels I like better for the same price.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

563,"2010-02-08",3.7,"Very dark brown pour with a lively white froth that dissipates slowly. The aroma is super vinous- grapes, raisins, caramel-port, spicy dough, backstrap molasses, brown sugar, and super subtle cocoa nib. The flavor also pervades with sweetness, though unexpected touches of roast and spice make for a chalkily crisp sensation. Plum, raisin, and all manifestations of dark fruit are powerful, as are more dark candi-sugars and some bakers chocolate.

Struggling back from illness this beer had been sitting waiting. Loved the Agnus and expected much from the brown. The appearance was solid and dark, and the smell malty and potent.

Pine resin, citrus, funk, molasses/treacle, pretty light fruit character, and much more interesting and delicate than expected.

The amount of generic beer in the aroma is surprising, its not necessarily bad, I just dont expect the typical grainy nose in Belgian brews. As the beer warms, everything gets better. A whiff now reveals more chocolate, raisins, and soft spices. I thought the palate was a bit thin, but again improves once it raises up to cellar temp. Delicate chocolate, bready and spiced notes make up the flavor with a surprising suggestion of lemons. I dont usually get any strong citrus out of a dubbel, but I found it quite prevalent here. The sweetness is appropriate, sadly reminds me of soda, but never becomes sticky or cloying.  This is a predominantly malty brew but isnt notably hearty. Its a fairly delicate beer and enjoyable.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Nose is interesting to say the least; a little port-ish and a grape note that is unique, Belgian chocolate, yeast, and hints at fig, molasses, and smoke.  Nose is a bit faint and hard to describe but certainly intriguing.  Flavor is a bit uninteresting as compared to the nose; raisin, darker chocolate, yeast, and some fig with mild spices in there too.  Palate is soft to lively, nearly medium, and silky but a little watery.  Finishes mostly sweet with a bit of dryness, chocolate and raisin notes lingering.  A fairly well done dubbel but really lacked the complexities of greater examples and the flavor was nothing compared to the nose.  Certainly not a typical example of the style but nice in its own regards.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

The aroma reveals that amazing Belgian yeast, orange citrus, plum and a bit of roasty, almost smoky malts. The flavor, differing mildly from the scent, gives way to a host of flavours not hinted at in the aroma. These include figs, clove, a variety of dark fruits, chocolate, candied sugar and also the yeaste.

The taste retains some of the characteristics of the nose. Like the fact that its too faint for its own good.

The longer I let this one sit the more intense the aroma becomes it is similar to the previous Belgium styles I have had and really wonderful. Robust flavor that is exceptionally crafted. Very malty indeed with some subtle roasted qualities. The flavor doesnt sway much from the nice aroma although it does seem to be a tad more mellow.

The overwhelming winner of the night was t Smisje Dubbel, with Corsendonk Pater finishing a strong if distant second.

<P>Wheat-like, smoky aroma featuring sweet tobacco and fresh lemon juice scents. Almost reminiscent of a rauch-weizen, although the smoke smell is much weaker here than in an actual rauchbier. Very strong, very good aroma. Pours a remarkably dark amber with a red hue and a very small amount of beige head. Sharp wheat and smoke-like tastes. Tastes like it smells, but I think those elements work better in the aroma than in the flavor. Dry finish. Sour and bitter aftertaste. Medium body. Very lively on the tongue. High in carbonation.

563,"2007-02-28",4.0,"THOUGHTS: Had this one on new years eve. Just a little too much carbonation. I couldnt stop burping. Looked incredible though. Ive been wanting to try this for a while and got it as an unexpected Christmas gift. I was greatly pleased with this one. It just got better as it warmed, more dark fruit and a little less yeasty in flavor. Nice beer.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark red-brown with tons of carbonation and an average, off-white head that mostly diminished. The aroma was light nutty and caramel malt and moderate yeast, along with dark fruit and cherry. The initial flavor was light to moderate sweetness and light bitterness, while the finish was lightly bitter and sour with an average duration. The body was medium and dry and oily with tons of carbonation and a lightly astringent finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

The head pours exceptionally thick and light beige. The foam dissipates relatively quickly, leaving a thin layer of many-sized bubbles leaving lots of lace on the glass. The aroma first hits you with yeast. Hints of soft fruit and citrus fruit and then some sweet malts follow the yeast. The flavor starts a bit sweet and dusty - some yeast, some toffee, and some fruit. The initial flavor also has some dark caramel,  toasted bread, and roasted malt flavors - which stay into the middle of the tongue. The middle of the tongue also presents some interesting fruit and malts. The finish is somewhat dry and bittersweet. The mouthfeel is quite light, bubbly, and creamy.

563,"2007-02-20",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 20, 2010 I had this on tap at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse in Pittsburgh, thanks to mtoast. This has got to be one of the best places to get a beer tasting experience. This corsendonk pours as a dark brown beer but is certainly not opaque.  It also has an orangey glow as I peer thru the brew.  The aroma is sweet with barely any yeast notes detectable.  None of that  beery yeasty smell that is so common with other beers. The head starts out thick but then fades to a thin coating., it does not turn into froth.  First taste is the personality of a leathery well worn gentleman.  You know, like the friend that you have become used to, a friend who has earned your respect. It has the perception of not too sweet rootbeer with hints of very weathered wet wood. It is not overly roasty but there is slight roastyness there. You would never know there is alcohol in this brew. Yes, roasty and musty, but not in a negative way, if that is even possible. I have never tasted anything like this before. I see lots of bubble rising in the brew but there is little carbonation in the tasting, just a mild roasty creamyness on the back of the tongue. The finish on this beer is nifty, I didnt even get a hint of bitterness on the back of the throat.  Very well behaved, but it does let you know you had some hops and malt, without being in your face. One of the most refined beers I have ever tasted.  Again, looking at the alky content, it is hard to believe there is any alcohol in there at all.  I guess this is what makes the better beers better. 	Grimbergen Double (Dubbel) abd Bells Hath no Fury cannot even hold a candle to this brew.  Now I know what a dubbbel should be like, there is no going back.

Iit was definitely excited to see the light and managed such a wickedly firm, two layered, continuously reproduced, pad of tannish foam that did lace well. Warming, mellowing and deeply earthy, peaty, generously fruity and malty aroma wafted endlessly from the glass. It also showed traces of smoke, cinnamon and cloves, also some of that alcohol as far as spice. The aroma was one of enticement and allurement but hey, its got to be palatable. In the mouth its vinous, short of being big and the carbonation, which holds out, is sadly fizzy and annoying. It yields some rich malts and a strong serving of pale fruitcake-like flavours that give it just a little depth. Firmly, thickly malty in the back the bitter fruits grasp just shortly before a generally dry, hot, warming, spicy and fruity, vinous swallow.

563,"2006-08-09",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 28, 2006 330 ml bottle 8/9/06

Pours deep brown with red highlights and a persistant head. The aroma offers tangerine and brown sugar with a considerable dose of leafy hops. The flavor brings porter notes, vinous, slightly sour, and rich with chocolate; I also get figs and plums and molasses, the sweetness of which is cut nicely by a reasonably drink and robust hop finish. Rich dark fruity malts dominate the yeasts, as Oakes pointed out in his review.

The mouthfeel is full but over-carbonated; not in a prickly sense but with the sort of bubbles that explode and fill your mouth. Still, Im pleasantly surprised at just how good this one is. 

Draft at the Barking Dog in Seattle 12/27/06.

Pours beautifully despite a modest head, black in the shadows, deep red-brown when held to the light.  The aroma is all raisins and dates. Theyre present in the flavor also, but there is so much else going on too. Not particuarly sweet, yet offering caramel and hints of chocolate, vinous tones and a whisper of orange peel, a nicely balanced finish that brings in enough hops to round out nicely.


This time Id give it about a 7/4/7/4/14, but unfortunately, the beer was served much too cold and this certainly influenced the tasting. On tap, it picked up a point on palate (the overcarbonation was no longer a problem) but dropped a point on aroma, flavor, and overall. At the proper temperature, it might have recovered each of these.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Aromas were sweet malt, brown sugar and molasses, dark fruit, peat, caramel, scotch and toffee.  Flavor was not the sweet maltiness I expected but rather a full-bodied and well-balanced brew with a nice bitter hop presence melded well with the sweet, smoky, fruity malt aspect, with the usual brown ale suspects -- coffee, chocolate, caramel, raisins and prunes -- lurking in the background.  Mouthfeel was excellent, slightly thick, not too bubbly, and spot-on for the ilk.  Most drinkable despite the high ABV.  One could make the argument that this is closer to a Belgian Strong Ale than an Abbey Dubbel.","Toledo, Ohio, USA","noelcb"

563,"2005-10-29",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 12, 2007 This review needs to be like the beer: punctual.  Corsendonk is a swift beer, faster and more ephemeral than anything else Ive drunk.  I drink some beers with a forced velleity in order to prolong the flavors life, and I drink some beers at a snails pace because theyre just downright undrinkable.  But the Corsendonk is too quick for that.  Its flavor slips by the tongue before the neural signals can pass to the brain leaving the drinker agog and confused.  The color is browner than it is red, and the smell has a copious hints of wine, grapes, alcohol and assorted dark spices.  The lacing is strong putting on a show worthy of box office sales.  But for the life of me I cannot discern the flavor.  It is woody perhaps, but far too quick for me to delve any deeper into its shrouded taste.  Sadly, its a good taste, so I wish it would last just a bit longer, but like a torrid love affair it is indescribably good but imperceptibly fast.  In a way it is like a haunting phantom  it appears to some only to disappear moments later, but in the spookiest cases it leaves a low wail that penetrates the listeners and embeds itself in their memory.  The Corsendonk Pater has likewise made a resounding entrance into my memory, though its wail is less macabre and more a fond reminiscence of a good flavor tragically lost to the brewers whim.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Pours with incredible head - light mocha, tons of little bubbles, not much bubbling in the beer, somewhat murky reddish brown - even with a careful pour, it was half foam!.  Aroma quite sour/tart, raisin, stewed prune, stale wine, vinegar, over-ripe apple, a little bread-doughy.  This bottle is about a year old, flavour is incredibly mild (more than younger bottles) slightly tart malt, melange of wine-steeped fruits (see above), with a pleasant cru-ish finish.  A hint of hops as it warms up, would be interested in a vintage bottle - say 5 years?  Recommended.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

Left a sort of creamy taste, sort of like that childhood memory of drinks from Sonic.  This beer was a beautiful chocolate color.  Only gave it a 3 on appearance because it takes like 3 years for the head to settle if you pour this out at any greater than 5mL a min.  Still an awesome buy if you havent tried it.

563,"2005-07-01",4.2,"Huge billow of lasting light tan head that leaves very nice lacing. Half way through the glass there is still a nice skim of
head. Amazing. How do they do that? Oh yes, and the beer itself. A nice tawny brown. Very clean, sweet aroma. Maple syrup. Figs. Some clove and banana, but very subdued and part of the whole, rather than the main thing. Flavors of brown sugar and some toasty flavor that compliments the brightness of the carbonation. A little bit smokey.Some definite bitterness, but none of it lingers into the finish. Mouthfeel is very pleasant. A nice take on the classic Belgian sugared up palate. There is something creamy there that makes it feel a bit more substantial than most dubbels, though still quite delicate and drinkable.

Overall: 17/20 This is a very well made dubbel. It has lots of the types
of flavors that I expect in the average dubbel, but displayed with much
more restraint, balance and subtly. Very tasty.","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"

The ample carbonation keeps a light tan colored head afloat atop the beer.  The aroma is bready and sweet, with notes of caramel, plums, and raisin.  The taste is a mixture of sweet and tart (though not in the sense of a sour ale) and highly carbonated.  The finish is rich and malty with lingering notes of sherry, and caramel.  There is a bit of funky Belgian character here, it contributes a rich fruitiness (plum, fig, and raisin), a light spicy character,  as well as a light musty type character, that may be more a function of age.

Aroma: Very complex aroma. Slight smokiness, no hop. Some caramelly malt with pineappley esters. Slight almond/sherry notes as well with a nutty component to it. I also got a winey aroma with chocolatey notes out of this. Nice!

Flavor: The flavor of this beer doesn't match the complex aroma, but its still nice. Raisiny malt with spicy yeastiness and a vague smokey flavor. No hop flavor which is ok for style.

Mouthfeel: High carbonation gives the impression of a thinner mouthfeel, and the carbonic acid and alcohol bite knock this one down a little in the mouthfeel rating. Still, not a bad mouthfeel.

Overall: Good beer, with concentration of great characteristics in some fields (aroma and appearance) and not as great (but not bad!!) in others (flavor and mouthfeel). Would definitely try this again as it is a rather complex beer and good for style.","Pennsylvania, USA","beermaniac"

I think I could spend half an hour looking for aromas in this, its so complex.  First sip revealed a medium mouthfeel, with strong notes of plum and dark chocolate, and perhaps some bubble gum/banana esters.

You have the yeast, the fruits (raisin or grape wine, maybe the port aroma coming through,) though the smokiness it mentions doesn't show too much.  Now I can really detect the port. Flavors are abundant and fairly complex. The port hits home first, then the raisin/grapes roll on in, a bread (sourdough comes to mind) and a slight touch of alcohol.

From the tap, however, this pours out a deep dark brown,with a ruby red tinge, and a medium tan head which fills and then slowly dissipates, leaving a long lasting lace which grips the glass like there is no tomorrow. If it is too cold like the one I had, warm it in your palms a little, and let the aromas flow. Caramel, Banana, raisins. . . how do I describe this delightful aroma. My first taste hinted of cocoa, no . ., caramel, then a whiff of dry alchohol. The texture was creamy like velvet. So soft an complex; let no wine lover tell you beer can't be as complex as wine. The warmer this beer became, the more I loved its taste. It finishes witih a bit of alcohol, but it is extremelty delicious.

Well balanced, but toward malt and finishes slightly on the sweet side; red grape alcohol fruitiness.  no hops in flavor or aroma anywhere.

563,"2003-07-18",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 23, 2003 Appearance is reddish brown with a good amount of off white head. Has some shimmering cloudiness.
Smells like sweet alcohol and figs, maybe some brown sugar in there and the yeast mixes in to the aroma, drying it out somewhat.
Taste is surprisingly dry yet has some rich undertones. Like dry maple syrup, and molasses, even some woodiness in here.  Perhaps a bit too dry.  There is some big alcohol-fig/raisin taste towards the begining/middle, and the body is medium.  Dosent thin out as much as leffe brun, so that was nice, though I find myself wanting just a touch more sweet malt.  This beer is very delicately balanced and must be served at the right temperature (60-62 degreeish), to fully appreciate the complexity.

Cannot see through the beer and have to catch the light just right to see into it.  Once that happens one can make out a lot of bubbles just going crazy inside.  Aroma is strong, malty with a Belgian sweetness.  Digging deeper I feel an effervescent, lively character.  Just shoots through the nostrils.  Mouthfeel is a perfect combo of carbination and medium body.  Leaves a sweet belgian aftertaste.  No hint of alcohol throughout.  The taste is what I have come to seek from Dubbels.  Nothing over the top.  A strong malt presence but well balanced with a the sweetness.  I get a slight hint of chocolate.

563,"2002-02-06",3.1,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2008 re rate-corked:  If you pour this into a more narrow glass, like a Corsendonk glass, it forms a mountainous roucky head with unattractive soapy looking bubbles.  If poured in a chalice, as I did with the second pouring, and let it sit, it forms an extremely creamy top with a ring of darker large bubbles.  This is the only time I have ever witnessed such a thing.  Aroma is caramel, raisins, and very perfumey.  I detected wood, cork, and light vanilla in the flavor.  Mouthfeel is effervescent.  The finish has an acidic feel, with hints of apples lingering for some time.  IMO, this is more of a hybrid Bruin/Dubbel.  Very appetizing.  96 bottling.  I had this two years ago and was not impressed, so I decided to put some in my parents cellar.  It has improved drastically.  Caramel notes alongside apples, raisins, and warming alcohol, combined to make this an elegant brew.  Surprisingly, this really did improve with a little age.

563,"2001-10-15",4.3,"All I can say is amazing.  Raisin aroma with some yeast in the nose.  Even more pronounced raisin flavors with some minor port wine notes.  Thick, rich brownish head that sticks around.  Deep, muddy brown color and great body.  I will be drinking it again and again.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

563,"2001-07-23",4.5,"One of the best looking glasses around. Carmel, yeast and alcohol aroma, effervescent and plenty of mouthfeel. Interesting but not gripping. Still a mighty fine brew.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
563,"2001-07-14",4.4,"Intitially a bit malty, perhaps even fruity. Nice, creamy head. My enjoyment of this was hampered only slightly by a very subtle alcohol taste, almost as if it were a cocktail instead of a beer. Still very good, and worth a try.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"
563,"2001-07-13",3.8,"Its tough for a beer of this style to not be enjoyable, but this one let me down a little for the price. I cant taste any hops and all of the flavor disappears almost immediately. It has a strong initial chocolate/fruity malt that quickly disappears. Very smooth, but not too exciting.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
563,"2001-07-11",4.2,"This beer has a strong raisin aroma that is just slightly stronger than the taste.  If one were to combine the flavors of raisins and brandy, I imagine this as the result.   Alcohol slightly pervades the smell, probably the only negative thing I can say about this beer.  Creamy head and an attractive dark brown color make this beer look as good as it tastes.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"

Not much head.  Aroma is pungent and
sweet.  Flavor is clearly sour, yeasty,
and malty.  Not bad - but surprisingly more
like a gueuze that an abbey ale.
Sourness remains but other flavors come out
as you finish it, giving it a nice complexity.
An enjoyable creation.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
