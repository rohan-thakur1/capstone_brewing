400,"2017-04-25",4.1,"16 ounce can. 
Pours a hazy reddish gold, an inch of foam, respectable lacing. Smells malty; caramel, biscuit, almost no bitterness, notes of vanilla and toffee. Taste is heavy on the caramel and vanilla, lighter on the toffee, light bitterness that seems to lean on the grassy side. Mostly sweetish finish. Tasty and enjoyable. A treat.","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"
400,"2017-02-16",3.3,"16 oz. can purchased at 7 Eleven, Kittery. Hazy dark golden color, full frothy head. Aroma is mild grain, yeast, traces of vanilla. . Vanilla and sweet grain flavor. The bitterness is on the low end with a distinct grassy note. The mouthfeel is nice and does have a nice texture. ABV is mostly hidden. A very simplistic style overall but certainly drinkable without any issue.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

400,"2014-04-13",3.3,"Bomber from Spirits Manahawkin. Poured an okay looking deep amber, almost reddish, with a smaller quickly fading tight foamy off white head. Aroma/flavor is all grains. Notes of pale malts, corn, white grape skin, dough and a touch of nut shell. Palate is big and slightly harsh, syrupy light carbonation and a lingering finish. Meh, not my favorite from Slumbrew by any means.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
400,"2014-02-06",3.6,"Bomber. Pour is a murky golden amber with a vigorous off white head that diminishes to to thin wispy bubbles around the glass. Smell is sweet with caramel and pale malt with a touch of hops and vanilla. Taste is honey and caramel with a bitter hop finish and creamy mouthfeel. Not bad.

400,"2013-12-14",3.8,"Bread, biscuits, fruit, and a little corn in the aroma. Flavor is malty, fruity, and sweet. Finish is spicy, lightly bitter and fruity. Im becoming a fan of this brewery--if youre in the mood for something a little different, this is a really good choice.","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","annunz123"
400,"2013-09-01",3.6,"Location: 22 oz bottle from Buy Rite, 9/1/13


Aroma: Th one has a nice doughy and malty nose, yeasty, plenty of spice, and some grassy notes

Appearance: It pours a clear caramel-orange color with a small white head and average lace

Flavor: The taste mildly sweet, yeasty and doughy, with a mild bitterness, and a spicy finish

Palate: It is medium bodied with a rather tingly feel and a bit of boozy heat on the finish

Overall Impression: 
This is a pretty nice beer.  Theres definitely a dearth of quality cream ales on the market.  This one helps fill that void, but Id like to see more breweries tackle this style.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
400,"2013-08-13",3.6,"Bomber. An orange amber beer that is hazed and sports a golden tinted two finger head. A lot of carbonation floating up from the bottom of the Spiegelau glass. A pleasant yeasty fruit aroma with soft malts and tangerine. A mild bitterness that settles in the back of the throat in the start. Noble hops? Nice malts are more complex than in the aroma and the fruit is softer. It tastes a little hot with the alcohol coming through.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
400,"2013-07-22",3.5,"Havent had many cream ales but becoming a favorite. This poured an orange/yellow, with white head. Medium bodied with smooth malt and a decent hop finish. Suprising that its 7.2 abv, goes down easy,","Holliston, Massachusetts, USA","berniecarbo"
400,"2013-06-24",3.6,"I havent had many Cream Ales in recent years (Genesee Cream Ale years ago) but thoroughly enjoyed this one. Has some noticeable but not excessive sweetness with a very smooth mouth feel. At over 7% its definitely full-bodied yet not heavy with the alcohol not highly notable. Wish Slumbrew would put this ale in a 12 oz. bottle when or if they go beyond marketing only in 22s.","Jaffrey, New Hampshire, USA","hampale"

400,"2013-04-05",3.8,"Drank in tall pilsner glass poured from 220z bottle. Aroma - roasted earthy smell. Appearance - golden auburn with avg froth and carbonation. Taste - caramel and hazelnut. Palate - get some burnt caramel taste. Overall - tastes like an upgrade to a red or amber beer. A little more flavor but still not my favorite. Really good for the style though","","KegOstertag"
400,"2013-03-24",4.1,"Nice and smooth. Vibrant deep orange pour. Complex taste notes in a solid malty base: cream, some citrus (orange?) sweetness, and a bit of hoppy kickness. Perhaps a toffee note or two as well. Creamy mouthfeel and lingering notes. Very enjoyable.

The beer is bright orange and mostly clear, sporting a small white head that leaves some good lacing on the tulip. The aroma brings floral notes, malt, cream. Wow, the cream character really comes through in the flavor. Vanilla and cream soda notes. Soft and smooth on the palate. I would definitely have this again.

400,"2012-05-02",3.6,"Aroma is spices, hops and pizza dough.  The flavor is malt sweetness, a decent hop bite, a hint of banana/bubble gum, and a mix of hops and malts in the finish, not smooth or crisp but balanced.  Such a strange style to make an imperial of, good for what it is, much more hoppier than a normal cream ale.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"

Some sweet malt candied ripe fruit,breadiness pretty mild altogether.
Taste has a strong tart citrus carbonation at first with some strong malt showing sweetness with some creaminess finishing with a strong citrus/peppery hop flavor. With peppery/citrus bittering that balances the malty orangelike sweetness of this strong malt,almost seems like a  imperial weizen a bit.Pretty good beer alot of good hop flavor with a strong malt presence,leaves a nice lingering flavor.","Iowa, USA","jmohno"
