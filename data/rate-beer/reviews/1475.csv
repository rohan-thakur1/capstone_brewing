Procenty po mistrzowsku zamaskowane. Tekstura pełna, trunek gęsty i oleisty.
Nic dodać, nic ująć, po prostu fenomenalny deser. 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Oryginalny i nieprawdopodobnie gładki Imperial Porter. I tak na prawdę mam to gdzieś, że dodano do niego sztucznych aromatów. Dla mnie piwo pachnie i smakuje jak prawdziwy amerykański pączek z dziurką, oblany gęstą czekoladą i z kolorową posypką cukierkową.
Imperial Doughnut Break jest wielowarstwowym trunkiem. Łączy w sobie cechy klasycznego Imperialnego Porteru (kawa, czekolada, ciasteczka, słody) z domieszkami wanilii, kakao, orzechów migdałowych i muffinów.
Duża butla (650 ml) trunku znika w oczach i to jest najlepszą reklamą dla tego piwa.

1475,"2017-01-15",3.5,"Piana śladowa. W aromacie bardzo słodko, czekolada, lukrecja, minimalny akcent ciemnych owoców. W smaku średnio gęste, słodkie, a słodycz tylko zwiększa się ku finiszowi, który jest wręcz lukrowy. Dalej trochę ciemnych owoców. Na plus nieźle ukryty alkohol, który momentami jest odczuwalny, ale prawie wcale nie przeszkadza. Na prawdę niezłe piwo, widocznie lepsze od pitego przeze mnie na początku roku puszkowego imperial biscotti break.","Lublin, POLAND","Estebanik"

Woof - what a beast. Basically a coffee and doughnut milkshake, with a seriously sneaky double digit ABV.

Je suis saisi par léquilibre que propose cette bière. Je mattendais à une lourde bombe de sucre. Or il nen est rien, ou presque.

The aroma is nutty and chocolate cakey. Its sweet and generally pleasant smelling, restrained on the booze, big on the sweetness. 

The flavor is plenty sweet & plenty chocolaty. Its got a lot of coffee... I had a kick there where I was dipping a good number of doughnuts in chocolate, the flavor achieved here is indeed akin to that. Its a bit boozy, but not over the top.

Aroma was a volatile chocolate up front, then dark malts, nutmeats, toffee, burnt sugar. Flavors like nose, in spite of the hype- not over sweet; in fact, nicely bittersweet; just enough tang. Exceedingly well balanced. Body is just perfect for the style with just enough boozy warmth, again to fit this style.

1475,"2014-09-21",3.9,"Poured from bottle into a snifter
 Appearance  The beer pours a super deep brown color with a one finger of tan colored head. The head has a fantastic level of retention, slowly fading to leave a great level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Swirling the brew in the snifter shows its very thick nature, with fingers of a thick syrupy look clinging to the sides of the glass before slowly receding back to the bottom of the vessel.
 Smell  The aroma of the beer is quite heavy of a roasted malt smell with a good showing of a coffee and chocolate as may have been anticipated from the name and look of the brew. Some aromas of a more sweet crème like nature as well as some caramel and darker fruits are present as well, all brining a strong level of sweetness to the nose. Along with these aromas so to come smells of a hot boozy nature, which overall mix with the others to create a sweet, dark, and warming smell of booze laden chocolate latte.
 Taste  The taste begins of a huge sweet flavor of tons of caramel and chocolate flavors as well as a good showing of a malty dark roasted taste. As the flavor advances, even more milk chocolate like flavors come to the tongue, with the milk chocolate becoming one of the more dominate tastes in the profile and brining an even higher level of sweetness to the brew. Some coffee develops on the tongue as it advances toward the end with other dark fruit tastes of fig and raisin developing more toward the end as well. A little bit more roasted malt flavor and some sweet crème flavors come to the tongue at the end with a decent showing of a slightly bourbon boozy taste as well as some light char. All these flavors in the end, mingle together to leave a rather thick cloyingly sweet and heavy chocolate latte flavor to linger on the tongue. 
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the very full and creamy with a carbonation level that was actually a little bit on the higher side then I would have anticipated. The thick body really accentuated the sweet flavors of the brew, almost to the point to where they were too potent. It was however, somewhat appropriate for the roasted and thick imperial porter style though. While a higher carbonation is not usually appropriate for an imperial porter, for this one, it actually was rather nice, as it did help subdue the thick syrupy sweetness and kept to boozy flavors form being all that overpowering. Overall that feel was pretty good for making this a more drinkable brew.
 Overall  A bit too cloyingly sweet and thick for my taste. It has some decent darker flavors, but these are just sorta lost in some of the massive sweetness. If only this was fermented down a bit more, then I think it would be a very enjoyable brew. But as stands, for the price this is one to shy away from.","","Darkmagus82"
1475,"2014-09-20",4.0,"650 ml bottle purchased at 7-11, Kittery, ME and cellared about 4 months. A swirl around the snifter shows an very oily residue like Exxon oil dumped into the ocean. Aroma is nice, more like chocolate cake rather than donut. Lots of molasses and also mild coffee beans 
The flavor is sweet and rich with a full chocolate cake of brownie batter flavors through out the sip. Solid amount of roasted malt, vanilla and burnt sugar. The oily texture on the tongue is the same I see when I swirl the snifter. The alcohol is barely found any place. Rich and decadent, imperial porter that I would think was an imperial stout, no matter the classification because this is solid.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

1475,"2014-06-08",3.9,"Bomber from Rays in Tosa, cellar aged about 2 months. Served at cellar temperature for the first glass, then cooler from refrigerating for the second. Pours opaque black with almost no head. Swirling gets faint cafe au lait streaks in the top. Very lowly carbonated. Aroma has bakers chocolate ... and more bakers chocolate. Plus some espresso and sweet caramel. Later in the glass some lactose shows through, along with some alcoholly aroma. Concentrating gets a ""glazed doughnut"" sugary-ness. Very nice - strong - chocolate/coffee/caramel blend. Taste is of bitter bakers chocolate, sweet caramel, bitter espresso, sweet lactose, with sugar. Very interesting in that it rots the teeth from the sweetness, yet has such a strong bitter component. Did it ever get cloying, well, perhaps at some points during the glass. Medium to full bodied with a bit of alcohol. Finishes quite long, and more sweet than bitter, but the bitter, with alcohol, does fight to keep balance. An interesting take on a very good brew. Personally, zero chance this is a stout, as it comes off a porter base, and says ""imperial porter"" on the bottle - plus would be far sweeter than any stout had to date. Solid tasty brew.

1475,"2014-04-17",4.1,"22oz bomber for *gulp* $18. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint. I heard their Imperial Biscotti Break was great, but it wasnt available, so I went with this hoping itd be as good.

Appearance: Pitch black with an almost orange colored head that doesnt last all-too long. Only a little bit of lacing. It looks pretty good given the ABV.

Smell: Im looking for doughnuts right away -- and theyre there, but not in a huge way. There is certainly a sort of doughy sweetness, but the huge amounts of roasted malt and chocolate sort of aromas take the forefront. A bit of that ""soy sauce"" sort of thing going on that I get in some really big imperials. A bit of alcohol. The nose on this just lets you know its got a high ABV. Quite nice on the nose overall, but disappointing given my expectation. Still, scoring it a 4. Truthfully though, if I werent told the name of this beer, Id probably not REALLY guess that this beer had donuts in it.

Taste/feel: Doughnuts? Actually, yes. Thankfully, they are more in the taste than in the aroma. Its more of a doughy flavor than an actual doughnut taste, but theyre certainly there. A nice full body to this beer. A surprising medium/high carbonation that actually works quite nicely. After looking back, this is labelled a porter -- that explains that. Dough flavor is there at the initial sip. A nice blend of roasted malt and coffee with a slightly burned quality then comes in afterwards, with a bittersweet mocha sort of finish. Also a slightly sour/salty-esque finish thats in some imperials. This beer is just *heavy*, but in a very good way.

Overall, I almost want to trash this beer given the price I paid, but Ill go ahead and not bother doing that. I was expecting (and actually hoping for) a beer with huge amounts of glazed doughnut flavor, but I just got a really nice imperial porter -- with some doughnuts added. Like I said, had the name of the beer not been ""Imperial Doughnut Break"", I wouldnt guess that doughnuts were used. There is definitely a doughy flavor, but Id not pinpoint it. Its a nice beer that Id have again, but its hard to justify the price here. Truthfully, I like this beer a bit more than my rating indicates (maybe by a quarter of a point in most categories), but its a slight let down.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

Aroma is full of sweet chocolate with lighter roast notes and some light alcohol spice. Not much fruit esters. Medium light coffee aroma. Light sweetness that is slightly reminiscent of a glazed doughnut. 
Pours dark brown to black with a moderately sized, thick dark mocha head that slowly but steadily recedes. Some light leaving and small legs. 
Flavor starts with a fairly sweet chocolate character that slowly turns into a slightly bitter dark chocolate note. Medium bitterness helps break through the sweetness. Light roast character and medium coffee notes; this is definitely not an assertive coffee character. Light alcohol spice in the finish with some residual sweetness and light bitterness. Not much ester or phenolic character. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied and rather creamy and silky with medium low carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
I wasnt really sure what to expect from a beer with this name, somewhat worried it was a gimmick beer, but it turned out to be a really solid sweet dark beer (bottle calls it a porter but I think sweet stout is more appropriate). Coffee character is well balanced but definitely in the background. Nice, clean yeast character does not detract from the malt notes.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Definite chocolate, coffee and roasted malt flavor- nicely balanced start to finish. Ends sweet, as it should.
