Aromas of big caramel covered bananas, biscuit, molasses, light orange zest, spices, and a bit of alcohol to round it out.  Some excellent aromas here, very inviting.  Taste of big banana, caramel, pepper, biscuit, clove, and molasses.  No bitterness on the finish; but there is some lingering notes of caramel, banana, bread, molasses, and spices on the finish for a bit.  Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel that drinks easily.  No alcohol noticed other than a slight warming after the finish.

3757,"2011-10-14",3.7,"$3.30 single bottle from Binnys ""best by"" Nov 09. Hey, I figured this could lay down for a while. This pours a big malty smell and, Ill admit, a bit of medicinal phenol from age. Deep brown in appearance, though not opaque or cloudy. Forget about sustaining any kind of head. But very malty and sticky. In a beer this aged, the weizen esters are long gone, leaving a plum impression, but then theres a tiny bit of banana in the burp-back. A bit of sherry in there as well, but still pretty sweet. So this is yet a very good aged beer, worth holding onto until now.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

Some leafy hops without much bite.  All in all this was a very drinkable brew but also a very ordinary one.  Not impressive.

3757,"2009-11-22",3.4,"My Bottom Line:
Cloves and bananas float atop this Weizenbocks caramelized cereals for a softly carbonated and lean example of the style.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam skirts the hazy dark amber.
-Carbonation could definitely be more effervescent.
-The flavor profile is not as complex as the best Weizenbocks out there.
-My expectations may have been too high for this brew as I usually love everything Great Lakes brews.

Light, given the high alcohol content, and the alcohol is well-masked in the aroma and flavor.  I am very impressed; this style of beer is easy to screw up, and its not even a style I am very fond of...and as usual, Great Lakes did an outstanding job at brewing a style that I dont really like in a way that I absolutely love!

Then again, we dont rate by style here, and, thus...I guess I cant rate by style, even when rating appearance, which makes no sense since appearance is 100% dependant on style.  That being said, if styles didnt exist, id say it still looked inviting, slightly hazed gemstone shiney amber, a halo of light tan, then a very small tropical island of bubbles in the middle.  The nose was wheaty I guess but weizenbock thickness and meatiness level, fuck no.  Sublte oats and orange peel is what I get.  Clean, softly wheaty...a touch of softly grilled orange...and drinkable..a weizenbock?

The aroma picked up darker fruits, toasty bananas, and a pinch of honey with accents spicy wheat and cloves.. sticky-sweet, warm overall impression.  The flavor used the alcohol warmth to amplify peppery and clovey character.. plums, caramel, and bready support at the core.. sweet, fruity finish with a spicy kick.

Flavor starts off with a strong banana presence, cloves come in for a very quick appearance but then fades to a light nutty banana bread flavor ending with a slightly strong grain alcohol note. Mouth feel is good and carbonation is on par to the style.

3757,"2009-08-12",3.5,"I bought a 6-pack of the GLBC Grassroots Ale when it came out, and that was a mistake.  Id have preferred if Id bought a six of this...much better.  When I think Weizenbock, and I think of the Schneider & Brooklyner Hopfen-Weisse as the form of the style.  And this looks, smells, and tastes enough like Schneider Weisse that I got the idea right away.  Pretty good - and in a style I find to be pretty uncommon but pretty tasty.  This beer pours orange with a ton of head.  Aroma is spice and malt.  Flavor is sweet, malty, and again, spicy with clove.  Mouthfeel is split - there is a full malty component, and a watery note.  Strange that mouthfeel is split into two different textures.

This beer didnt knock my socks off - but solid.  Id recommend.

3757,"2009-08-10",3.5,"Enjoyed from a 12oz bottle in a pub glass.  The bee pours a medium to deep amber color, with a short-lived white head.  The nose brings the characteristic ""Wiezen"" notes of some clove, and a touch of tropical fruit.  Also evident is some malt and a bit of alcohol.  The mouthfeel is pretty full across the palate, and flavors of yeast-derived esters, along with some pilsner malt come through.  The presence of alcohol, along with a fairly high note of carbonation combine to make the finish of the palate a bit harsh.  Overall, a nicely crafted beer.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

Theres also a bit of vegetalness there too.  Theres a somewhat irony vegetal quality throughout that detracts from the soft dark fruit flavors.  The flavor also has notes of ripe banana, spicy hops, pepper and clove.  The body is creamy but a little thin for a weizenbock and heavily carbonated.

Swells like a heavy weiss, with bananas, sweet wheat, malt-o-meal, bubble gum; just a rather heavy weiss scent. In some ways right and in a few others a bit too sweet. Fairly heavy, and nearly too ""dead"" a feel. I still like some zip in my weizenbock. Fruity and malty start, with marzipan and bananas. Middle has a bit of vanilla. A nice progression on tastes.

Taste is very malty with lots of caramel and a nice brown sugar taste. Underneath the heavy malt taste, there is lots of spice, banana, and yeast. Has a very bready overall taste. At first, the alcohol is very harsh and it takes a few sips to get past it. Once the beer warms, it becomes a very pleasant drinking experience. It never quite shakes the medicinal taste though. Worth drinking.","Burbank, Illinois, USA","BeerBunker"

A recent release from Great Lakes this one I sought out hoping it would erase memories of the disaster that was Grassroots.  Not only does it do that it is one of the best weizenbocks I have tried.  This is a style I need to seek out more often.

Aroma / Appearance - The opaque mahogany body and off white head sticks to the sides of the glass.  Caramel, black cherry, sourdough pretzels, and semi-sweet chocolate chips mix into a malty blend.

Flavor / Palate - Fluid and light bodied it sits easily on the tongue and throat.  Chocolate chip bread, cherry hard candy, and fruity notes make this is enjoyable to drink.  Despite being 8% it goes down easily.  A great value at around $10 this one will hopefully make it to your area soon.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The taste starts out really rich with caramel, toffee, and banana, but this quickly switches to a bone dry finish of tart wheat, spice, and yeast.

When I first smelled this I thought I got a blast of smoke aroma but it’s just the nose getting used to the intense phenols.  After a couple seconds it turns into intense clove and banana.  I hate to be so stereotypical saying clove and banana but it really does display those two things and they are very heavy, especially the banana.  Very ripe, fresh, dessert-like banana.  Taste is very phenolic with the same flavors coming through.  Spritzy on the tongue.  Very flavorful.  Hides its alcohol very well.

Apples, hay, yerba, and vanilla with a somewhat lactic tone.  Hints of quiet pineapple and aggressive cloves, predictable though authentic.  Medium bodied palate lacks depth and leaves an impression thinner than it actually is.  Finishes with cherry pits and wet wood, pulsing with rotted mossy earth and sweetness.

3757,"2007-10-07",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 18, 2009 Courtesy boboski, from a growler. This poured a sunset orange color with a thin white head. It smelled of bananas, cloves, some cinnamon, wheat, and some sweet citrus fruit. The flavor was somewhat tart and sweet from the fruits with the wheat characters coming through. The sweet flavors really come through and is nicely carbonated, and leads to a crisp clean finish. The flavors were really well balanced and masked the alcohol very well. The mouthfeel was lowly carbonated with a thick and sweet flavor to it that lends to being very easy to drink. Really well done for this style. A pleasure to be able to try this.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
3757,"2007-10-05",3.9,"Growler courtesy of crizay: Pours a hazy copper amber with full, nicely-lacing off-white head.  Aroma has some light sulfur and tart notes along with a touch of clove and bready German yeast.  Body starts fairly full with an authentic, doughy wheaty sweetness, some banana and clove flavor toward a bready German yeasty finish.  Nice authenticity and good drinkability, a good weizenbock and surprising made in America, but not quite Aventinus.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3757,"2007-10-03",3.9,"From bomber courtesy boboski.  Pours a muddy caramel-brown with a thin light khaki head that quickly moves to the edges of the glass.  Sweet and fruity with a healthy dose of phenols reminiscent of an overripe banana.  Lighter on the palate than expected, and well-supported by the carbonation.  Light sugarcane taste with dates and plums in the middle.  The smooth finish is slightly sour and contrasts the overall sweetness nicely.  The sweetness never overpowers.  A fine brew.","Florida, USA","JMFG"
3757,"2007-10-03",4.1,"A thin off-white head recedes slowly, not fully; fat, sparse dot lacing remains. Murky, multi-hued ambers and hot oranges swirl amongst each other in a dense body flooded with immobile, fine carbonation. Banana and clove are evident first, alone in a soft but full aroma. Banana is fresh and overripe and joined soon after by passionfruit, plum and vanilla. Herbs and toasty malt provide an earthy background. Yeast is fully attenuated and sugars are mild. Alcohol is extremely well masked. Simple but effective employment of malt and yeast. An expansion of seriously sweet banana and multiple esters becomes even sweeter upon first sip. Bitterness is soft and definitely must be sought out. Plum provides a sugary note with hints of herbs and earth. The flavor is very highly sweet, but is admirable and doesnt lead to a sticky or cloying finish; the finale of each sip is actually quite clean and attempts a crisp turnaround. The finish is smooth, balanced within the typicalities of the style, lengthy and sublime. The mouthfeel is softly and very lowly carbonated, thick and gooey, extremely easy to drink. Awesome.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
3757,"2007-10-03",3.8,"Courtesy boboski. Pours a very hazy, murky amber, touches of auburn.  Head is non-existant.  Aroma is full on ripe bananas and cloves, pleasant grains, some raisins.  Flavor was mellow and well rounded, the wheat presence does shine a bit.  The sweetness is there, but is not over the top r off putting in any way.","Saint Cloud, Florida, USA","CheesedMan"
3757,"2007-10-02",3.9,"Courtesy boboski.  Pours a cloudy, cool looking, dark orange/red with a tiny little white head.  Smells of mild banana, clove, some sweet tart fruits, wheat, cinnamon and malts.  The flavor is slightly tart, mildly carbonated, with a profound wheat presence.  Seemingly more weizen than bock.  Get some sweet fruits right off the bat, then turns into banana and wheat characters.  Nicely donr for this style.  Balanced well and enjoyable.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
3757,"2007-10-02",3.9,"Courtesy boboski. Growler. Hazy amber/brown/burnt orange. Small layer of off white carbonation reduces itself to a ring. Aroma of pungent past ripe fruit, banana, clove like spice, light floral sweetness, and toasted grains. Flavor adds whole grain bread, subtle caramel, roasted nuts, and airy yeast. Medium/full body. A bit low on carbonation- the growler was opened a few hours ago and has been kept closed when not being poured, but likely still the cause. Not a big deal, though. Excellent weizenbock.","Florida, USA","SoLan"
3757,"2007-10-02",3.8,"Courtesy boboski.  Growler.  Cloudy, murky, dark orange-amber body.  Minimal, wispy film at the top with a small, off-white edge.  Tiny, organic looking snakes of lacing that droop their way back to the body slowly.  The aroma shows big, sweet bananas that are just past the point of ideal ripeness.  Wafts of softened clove and nutmeg accompany the fruity sweetness.  The flavor has a base of mashed banana puree.  The spiciness is very soft and subtle on the palate.  Theres a single drop of agave nectar sweetness, and maybe even some subtle hints of golden raisons.  The body is just on the heavy side of medium.  Very smooth, almost silky on the tongue.  The finish is short, clean, and ever so slightly sticky.  Really nice brew.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
3757,"2007-09-29",4.2,"Growler from miketd - thanks!  Cloudy brown pour with a small head.  Big, sweet aroma thats dominated by banana, fresh berries, spice, and sweet bready malts.  Flavor is very sweet and fruity with lots of banana, some berries, sweet grains, spices, and summer fruits.  Sticky and tingly - a really nice W-Bock.  Nice example of one of my favorite styles.","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"

3757,"2005-12-10",3.9,"Doughy citrus, plums, raisins and dates all figure prominently in the enticing aroma.  Opaque cloudy tan-copper body is topped by a low, fine bubbled, off white head that lasts well and leaves some sudsy lacing.  Lightly alcoholic dark fruit flavour with plenty of sugary sweet malt character.  Medium full body with moderate carbonation.  Sampled at GABF 2005.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
3757,"2005-10-22",4.2,"GABF 05.  Pours a cloudy amber with an aroma of bubblegum and banana.   Flavor follows suit, but its more like a Belgium version of a hefe than a German.  Palate coats.  Outstanding beer.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"

3757,"2005-10-10",4.2,"Muddy brown, covered by an enormous off-white foamy and eternal head. Charming aventinus like toasted malt and identifiable biscuitiness is taken aback by this surprisingly efficient yeast bringing forth pure doughy, banana, grapey and cloves glory. Remarkable flavours integration, whereas the chocolate meet the cloves into an herbal fashion and to make any Chefs envy. Body is medium in size, creamy, ample and mineral, showing the wheat a perfect ground to work in. Exquisite balance, might be as good as Aventinus.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Hazed yellow hue with a nice frothy head and very good lace. The aroma has notes of banana and clove esters, caramelized and smoked malting, a bit of wheaty and grainy notes, and even a bit meaty. The taste follows suit with good working of both the weizen and bock character. More weizen up front with the fruity and spice nature before a smoky and sweet finish. The feel is smooth and creamy. One hell of a brew and one of my favorites at the fest.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Came far from blowing me away, but this was a nice step up in all aspects from Flying Dogs.  Solid malty and estery nose with good flavor balance and mouthfeel.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3757,"2005-09-10",4.5,"This beer is excellent.  It has a gorgeous golden wheat color, with a beautiful foamy golden head.  The head is creamy and pillowy on the palate.  The body of the beer is thick and feels great on the palate, as well.  The beer smells strong of banana, and spice, with wheat.  The taste goes down smooth, and is very sweet but with just enough wheat and malt flavoring to remind you that it is beer.  The aftertaste is creamy, and sweet.  What a great beer.  It would be tough to drink many of these.  But if you are going to drink a beer that is sweet, ... make sure its this one.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","TINOZACCA"

3757,"2004-11-09",5.0,"UPDATED: SEP 28, 2007 The desription says it all, it really does. The color is the inside of a plum, the scent is spicy, cloves and banana. Guess what it tastes like, cloves and banana. Creamy as all hell, the lower levels of carbonation do this beer justice. Its puts me into a beer nirvana that cannot be explained. Im in love with this beer. Just a great collaboration of spiciness, banana, and a creamy mouthfeel. Its been 3 years and is staying my only 5.","Brook Park, Ohio, USA","crizay"
