2223,"2016-11-29",3.6,"October 11th, 2014 - Alesmiths Oktoberfest is a smoldering, smoky guest to the Oktoberfest party, deep orange-red, with an amber colored head where the light mixes with the foam. The aroma is heavy and gruff, practically fuming with smoke and burnt honey, like it was lifted fresh from a smoker. The flavor is sweeter, but the smoke hasnt retreated, maintaining its presence across the senses. It is joined by the equally saturnine molasses note, both filling the mouth in a weirdly satisfying way. The aftertaste is short, but reveals a whole new flavor in smoked almonds. All in all, this is an assertive Oktoberfest, and much smokier than the other offerings on display around San Diego, but still quite good, if heavy.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
2223,"2016-11-10",3.5,"Tap. Pours lightly hazy orange, small off white head, decent lacing. Aroma of roasty malt, bread, grain, caramel, light grass. Flavor is light plus sweet, minimal bitterness, malty, a bit roasty, bread. Medium light body. Solid.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
2223,"2016-10-29",3.9,"Draught at Rattle N Hum East, 10/9/16.Clear, bronze-copper body is topped by a light beige head that is medium-sized and shows good retention.Sourdough and fruity specialty malts in the nose give a pretty authentic rendition. No American hop notes here, with definite earthy, leafy, spalt-like hop notes and fresh, doughy yeast. Light caramel and toffee but it doesnt seem sugary despite its good depth of rich malt. Very clean and with no alcohol.Malty, as it should be, with sourdough and lots of honey-caramel character. Moderate, engaging carbonation and a fairly soft texture with a bit of hardness from the specialty malts. But it doesnt go too far with those and still provides backing bitterness to balance from the obvious Noble hops. Earth, spice, herbs and more fruity notes linger with satisfying maltiness and no flaw or alcohol. Quite impressively authentic.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
2223,"2016-10-08",3.2,"On tap at Rattle n Hum - East, pours a clear copper with a small white head. Aroma brings out toasted bready malt and some corn. Flavour is along the same lines, with lots of toasted bread malt, some sweet cereal notes and a little corn. Nicely made for the style but rather underwhelming. Decent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
