2371,"2017-04-30",3.6,"Medium deep offwhite lasting head. Clear deep dark reddish brown body, nearly still. Juicy caramelized sugar and wood aroma with spicy gooseberry notes. Resiny juicy caramelly taste with wooden spicy notes. Mid-bodied. Mild, soft, smooth mouthfeel. Dryish resiny toasted sugar and spice aftertaste with gooseberry notes. Wow. This was just excellent. Full of flavour, highly drinkable, juicily moreish. (0.65l bottle, from wine monopoly somewhere.)","Oslo, NORWAY","larsga"
2371,"2016-11-24",3.7,"A sweet like amber ale. Has a nice caramel characteristic that evolves into a nice bitter finish. Delicious","NEW ZEALAND","Hoponmate"
2371,"2016-11-24",3.4,"UPDATED: NOV 27, 2016 On tap at Brewers Cooperative. Aroma is caramel, malt, pears, pepper. Flavour similar. Decent amber ale, with a nice amount of caramel, I guess from the rocks. Nice.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","explosivedog"
2371,"2016-03-16",3.6,"A grand red ale, if you fancy a bit more body than a normal IPA. Beautiful red colour and resinous hop aroma","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","tombutlin"
2371,"2015-01-23",3.6,"BOTTLE. Poured red with an off white head. Malt & hops on the nose. Sweet hops with a malty flavour up front, flowing into sticky toffee then ending with sweet hops... mild bitterness lingers after. Sourced Cape Cellars","Busselton, WA, AUSTRALIA","Andrus86"
2371,"2014-07-23",3.9,"Bottle from Archive Beer Boutique April 2013. Thus is the first Garage Project Beer that I had and the label certainly caught my eye. Copper colour, tan head, malt, nutty biscuit aromas, full in the mouth.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"
2371,"2014-04-11",2.9,"Little dissapionted tbh. Not as hoppy as I was hoping. Plenty of crystal malt flavours that didnt quite do it for me.","Surrey, ENGLAND","Gramoit"
2371,"2013-12-22",4.6,"Superb fruity hops balanced by sweet malt - light on the tongue and easy to quaff - a lovely ale more an IPA than Amber ale.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","Hop_Hedonist"
2371,"2013-11-09",3.7,"Volcanic rocks. Amber w slight haze, nice bubbly head. Earthy, quite chewy, in fact a great chewy character.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
2371,"2013-09-13",4.3,"Bright reddish-brown, auburn colour. The aroma is fairly subdued, although there is some fresh hops and an earthy character coming through. The initial taste is dominated by the pungent hops flavor (that will be the whole cone Nelson Sauvin hops), but before too long the caramelized sugar and toffee flavours come to the fore, with a good amount of pungent hops bitterness and a slightly funky, almost mushroomy taste on the finish. The texture is smooth, with a velvety, rich mouthfeel. If you like your beers to have a good amount of bitterness but also some sweet caramel malt flavor, this is the beer for you! I certainly enjoyed it.","NEW ZEALAND","SAChubb"
2371,"2013-07-13",4.2,"Bottle from Slowbeer. Deep reddish-brown, lasting, creamy tan head, amazing aromas of toffee/caramel/butterscotch, piney/grassy hops, flavour is sweet malt, burnt sugar/caramel, strong resiny bitterness. This is something special.","AUSTRALIA","ShaneJ"
2371,"2013-06-09",4.5,"Bottle from K&G. Great malty beer. Aromas of caramel, nuts. Taste is sweet, with long length. Palate is syrupy, and full bodied. Brown, with a frothy head.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","davidm"
2371,"2013-06-08",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 12, 2016 Tropical aroma in a copper pour.  Hop forward balance with fruity body and just a hint of caramel.  Finish is crisp clean and decidedly moreish.
Note: Nitro version is even better - the added silkiness enhances the overall package.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","beer-yum"
2371,"2013-06-05",3.3,"Nice bright red with huge white head. Subtle floral hop aroma. Herbal hop flavour, warm mouthfeel. Very smooth, pleasant.","Waterloo, Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","beerledgend"
2371,"2013-06-02",3.6,"650ml bottle. Pours a hazy deep ruby amber, with a smallish off-white head, which lasts well and leaves reasonable lacing. Toffee malt mixes with nutty and earthy notes and some light floral hops in the aroma. Floral and light tropical fruit hops up front lead into a rich malty body, with plenty of toffee, caramel and nutty character, which flows through into the finish. This is a satisfyingly malty ale, with enough hops character to keep it in balance. Nice stuff.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"
2371,"2013-05-11",3.6,"Bottle from mane liquor. Pours a deep copper with an off white head. Nose is quite grassy and has floral hops. Hints of grapefruit in there too. Taste has a nice caramel malt sweetness combined with grapefruit hops, grassy and floral tones. Grapefruit bitterness smashes the palate. Pretty decent stuff","AUSTRALIA","jonnyguns"
2371,"2013-05-05",3.6,"Pours copper with a fading head.
Nose shwos caramel, resinous hops, some fruit, bready malt and toasty notes.
Pretty aggressice flavours, very hoppy but lots of malt too. Some caramelised, almost melanoidin-like malt. Piny and grapefruit hops with a sharp bitterness follow.
Good high carbonation.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Davros"
2371,"2013-05-05",3.7,"650mL bottle (bottle labeled ""Red Rocks Reserve""). Pours deep amber with an off white head and a very nice tropical fruit/toffee aroma. Very nice chewy toffee flavour with a wonderful fruity backing Worth a shot, nice beer.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","Brenhophead"
2371,"2013-05-03",3.8,"A bit good, this has a lovely balance of the hoppy and is carried well by the lovely caramel. The hops are always there, green and grassy, not so as to intrude but they play well off the malts. Its just a good.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","Pdubyah"
2371,"2013-04-17",3.9,"Red amber with sml-med head. Smells.. Piney hops some citrus, malt and toffee. Tastes.. Piney resinous citrus fresh hop, rich tasty malty toffee caramel. Dreamy, will buy another next time b4 theyre gone.","Perth, West Australia, AUSTRALIA","NBird"
2371,"2013-04-03",3.7,"Bottle from Mane Liquor. Pours amber with a small khaki head leaving solid lacing. Nose shows loads of floral and grassy hops with some caramel biscuit behind it. A touch grapefruit in there. Taste is biscuit and caramel malts. The good make this shine though. Very floral. A very large dose of grapefruit on the finish. Gives it a nice lengthy bitter sourness. Very pleasing and quite sessionable. Solid stuff","Perth, AUSTRALIA","maneliquor"
2371,"2013-03-16",3.8,"Im prolly a bit late on the scene for this one, the aroma isnt as intense as I know it should have been. Also interestingly a big lump of dark brown  snot came out into my second glass. Actually, before I strained it out it looked like a chinese Tree Ear mushroom floating in my beer, poking through the beautiful beige head. I continued drinking the beer because: 1) I love Tree Ear mushrooms 2) The beer tastes great, esp as it warms up. It takes on what I would call a very APA type of bitterness mixed with the toffee notes everybody bangs on about. Nice.","North Shore, Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","DylansDad"
2371,"2013-02-17",4.5,"This was fantastic! A lovely beer with great balance and fantastic flavour a real winner. I loved the toffee and carmel flavours to balance the hops: an amazing amber.","AUSTRALIA","pmuzz"
2371,"2013-01-23",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2013 Nice clear deep red amber brown with a nice fluffy off white head. Aroma: nice citrusy hops, little danky, bisquity malts, caramel. Taste: piny, caramel, bready, spicy, sweet, toasty, a little burnt, balanced hop prescence. A solid brew! First rating from NZ. Bottle was brought back to me by a very special lady!","Linköping, SWEDEN","Tinco"
2371,"2012-12-13",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 6, 2015 Hops and malt to the fore in this one.  Nicely constructed as it is well balanced.

2014 version:  Much more potent and in your face.  Has that GP hop funk that keeps you interested.  Alc 6.5% - correction coming...","NEW ZEALAND","omega"
2371,"2012-12-06",3.7,"Wow. Tasted off tap (way too cold) at Pomeroys in Christchurch. A sort of hazy reddish brown pint with just the most generous nose of grapefruit and gooseberry along with tangy orange toffee. From first sip to last, a pint that gave those gratifying flavours and still sits full, citrussy and malty on my tongue. I would give my left one to have tasted this on handpull, I really would... I really would consider giving my left one, but may decide better of it. Im rather attached to my left one. Anyway, a pint with plenty of potential.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
