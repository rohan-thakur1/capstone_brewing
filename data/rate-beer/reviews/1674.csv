1674,"2016-05-19",3.5,"12oz can thanks to SHIG. Poured a thinner density super dark almost black brown with a large piss foam beige head. Body is thinner with soft carbonation and a quicker fading aftertaste. Aroma of chocolate, spoiled milk dark wet toast, peat, vanilla, baking soda. Flavor is similar with ash and soy also. Solid beer but thin body, which is true to style.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"

1674,"2014-09-03",3.5,"Thanks to Kevin for bringing this one down here. 
I poured this into a mug. 
The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a thick one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute leaving some thick creamy and foamy lacing that stuck for a while. 
The smell had a dry roasty coffee, slightly robust and light chocolate comes through nicely. 
The taste was mainly a dry robust roasty coffee which led to the aftertaste and finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation seemed appropriately styled and was good to me.
Overall, I say this was a pretty good Irish Dry Stout that I would have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
1674,"2014-02-26",4.0,"Puffed out Can - Watch Out on Aging this one!
Dark brown coloured body with a bit of a ruby, violet and lighter brown glow when held up to a light, all with an eight centimetre tall rich light brown head - all that carbonation has to go somewhere. Aroma of alcohol, roasted malt, icing sugar, yeast and a bit of oatmeal. Medium-bodied; Rich chocolatey character and roasted malt flavours show the strongest with an oatmeal finish and lingering bitterness from hops noticeable as well. Aftertaste shows a dry quality, some toffee and nutty sweetness and a bunch of effervescence. Overall, a surprisingly nice stout with a low alcohol, but a lot of flavour - definitely worth trying if you can find this one, but do NOT age this, my can was ready to explode! I sampled this twelve ounce can purchased from La Bodega in Anchorage, Alaska on 04-October-2013 for US$1.70 sampled at home in Washington on the opposite end of this country on 26-February-2014. 

aged for ~5 months with the last month in a fridge, and this one was ready to explode.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

1674,"2013-08-09",3.6,"Black color with tan head. Dry black malt, deep roast, ash aromas. medium body, average carbonation. Nice dark chocolate, smoke, deep roast malt flavors---good","Same Trailer, Different Park, Louisiana, USA","AmEricanbrew"
1674,"2013-04-29",4.0,"Bottle courtesy of AKFaust. Colour...jet Black with a thin head. Nose...coffee, roasted nuts and cocoa powder. Palate...a volley of coffee starts the tasting experience, though it is subtle, then comes the ash and char but its bit too dry. Theres a distinct dark chocolate  component here but not in a heavy form. The feel is somewhat thin, but in the same vein as a Beamish (and that aint a bad thing!). A truly dandy Irish style stout. Eireann go bragh!","Portland, Oregon, USA","neepsntatties"

1674,"2012-10-21",3.8,"Draft @ King St. Dark brown almost black with a thick, creamy, nitro head. Aroma of chocolate and coffee mostly light caramel. Flavor is semi-sweet chocolate with some bitter roasted malt. Medium to full body with a creamy, nitro mouth feel. Fantastic beer for the style, lots of flavor but very drinkable. All of King Streets beers are solid and this one is one of the best.","Anchorage, Alaska, USA","savnac"
