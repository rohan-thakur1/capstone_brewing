347,"2016-09-16",4.0,"Bottle from Scopey, drunk 9/9/16.Well-carbonated, deep brassy-gold liquid shows high clarity and an off-white head that is large and well-retained for the style.Smells like Cuvee Rene. I always think this beer has an extremely distinct nose with strong band-aid, red apple, horseblanket and/or sweat. But having never done a blind tasting with it, I cant be too sure. Regardless, thats what I get and its solid, aromatic and not aggressive in any way, with moderate acidity and lots of fun brett. Probably somewhere between a Girardin and a 3F, though the older versions (2000-2004 vintages) were just bizarre and ultra-funky. Not so much here, though there is some sweat, light cheese and horseblanket. No sulfur or mousey notes, however and lighter overall in the acid department.Thats fine, though, and the beer seems more mellow in general, with less intense sourness and a bigger balance between malt/wheat and acid. Fine/tight carbonation as it should be with appropriate attenuation and no oak. Seems to me the lambic houses have all become more mild/balanced across the board (3F, Cantillon, Lindemans) with the exception of Hanssens which has probably become even more sour recently (and I havent had recent Girardin or De Cam).Anyways, very lovely gueuze that is missing some of the charm I seem to recall from older vintages, but still very clean and well-executed/blended.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Smells of a musty, yogurty funkiness among crisp lemon peel and fermented apple. Tomato straw gets wrapped up by moldy earth, with a fungus note and old leather, defining the rich tartness, coming along with a present fruitiness to it. Its cheese funkiness blends beautifully into the sappy lime qualities of the beer, creating an overall very crisp nose. 

Has a vivid carbonation, while the mouthfeel remains pleasantly soft, with a stony minerality during the finish.

Tastes of crisp lime peel, almost juicy if it wasnt for a prominent, dusty earth funkiness, revealing notes of leather and rustic cheese. Its bubbly carbonation brings a lemony dryness to the palate, also revealing a stony quality among old leather and wet hay. Finishes with apple stone pits, even more cheese, a touch of vinegar among the profound milk acidity, tied together by fermented, sweeter apple peel.

347,"2015-09-29",3.9,"Gold with a large white head that collapses to an inch and then is soon gone. Bright lemon and under-ripe apricot aroma with woody funk underneath. Very high carbonation, slightly lactic slippery, fair bit of Bretty zing - the texture is lovely and enlivening, but maybe the bubbles are slightly overdone. Sour but not quite dry even at the end. Quite woody with enough stone fruit and lemony notes to balance. Some other sherbet-like and tropical fruit are peeking out too. Complex and elegant rather than all that intense. Very good.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

347,"2015-09-19",3.8,"Capped & corked 750mL Champagne bottle. 
Doing my part for Zwanze Day, it would seem.
Hazy effervescent orange gold body, small ring of white head.
Aroma springs from the glass - hay, cereal malts, white pepper, hard cheese, grapefruit, non-specific white grape juice, touch of barnyard and Bretty fermented pineapple.
Lively carbonation, quite soft and smooth though, lifted acidity is well tempered, not at all out of place.
Plenty to enjoy here - grapefruit rind & hay, hard cheese & quince, white pepper and pineapple, browned apple & nutmeg spice; really varied, changes and intensifies as it warms. Long finish, dry without being chalky, low bitterness.
Very elegant and sophisticated, not as brutally vinegary as many can be, quite mellow, rounded, bit Fino sherry-esque in some ways.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"
347,"2015-09-12",4.0,"Limited edition of Cuvée René, containing a lot more old, barrel aged lambic than young lambic; from what I understood, Lindemans uses only small portions of the precious old lambic in their regular Cuvée René beers, and none at all in their more commercial sweetened beers, so this is an interesting concept with which they reward their faithful customers, I guess. Warm, initially cristal clear (becoming progressively hazy and eventually cloudy as the bottle gets emptied), orange golden colour with vivid, champenoise sparkling, sustaining an immensely stable head, which was still completely closed half an hour after pouring, with an egg shell-white colour, dense and moussy structure and elegant lacings on the wall of the glass. The nose has clear lambic mustiness but in a sedate, noble and gentle kind of way, a bit restrained, breathing aromas of gooseberry, passion fruit, even strawberry and cucumber, earth, dusty dried flowers, oloroso sherry, refreshing acidic lemon peel, sour cream, moist wood, fermenting hay, lambic sweatiness; this array of odours becomes - expectedly - a bit more intense and more vinegary as more of the yeast is added to the glass, but it does stay elegant and relatively soft. Taste has that same gentle, noble character: not harshly biting like some other geuzes, rather mals and soft, with still a lemony acidity going through the whole, but finely so. Fruity esters all around, sour gooseberries, unripe plum, white grape peel, with a spritzy, champagne-like carbo and a smooth, wheaty and lightly bready body on which the lambic tartness is carefully built. This tartness dries the finish along with clear wood tannins, a bit earthy yet, again, noble and elegant; there is a powdery yeastiness but (logically) only in the end of the bottle; and a deep and dim old hop bitterness brings structure without interfering with the lambic esters and sourness too much. This geuze indeed very clearly breathes the noble, temperate, rounded and softened, mature character of old lambic more than their regular Cuvée René, yet it has the same mals mouthfeel and restrained vinegar acidity. A dry, grape peel-like wryness lingers after swallowing.  Actually very accessible, too bad only 15,000 bottles were made; this accessibility, however, is also due to the fact that there is not as much old lambic complexity as I had expected.  Nothing a few years of cellaring cannot solve, doubtlessly...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

347,"2015-09-03",4.3,"(750ml bottle from www.biere-revolution.com) Pours a lightly hazed orange gold with a big, short-lived white head fading to a ring with little lace. Aroma is very intense, both fruity and woody. A surprising amount of wild berries in the nose, especially wild raspberry, a musty and almost nutty oak character, leafy, touches of orange peel and a cellar type of funk. Fairly light tart fruity acidity, lactic/citric. Complex. On the palate, much more sour and acidic - mostly lactic, tart and fruity. Notes of tart/sour berries (raspberry, maybe cloudberry, cranberry?), green apple, lemon. Wood quite prominent, dry and oaky with quality of leather and dry earth toward the finish. Notes of dried herbs. Funk is pretty restrained, slight musty cellar. Finish very dry, woody/earthy, nutty, hints of lingering fruit and dry leaves. Mouthfeel moderate with fairly high mouth-filling carb, big bubbles. Wow, I expected woody from 4+ year lambic and its definitely there, but paradoxically its also the fruitiest gueuze I can remember.
