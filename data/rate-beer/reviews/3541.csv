3541,"2017-06-12",4.4,"Tap @ Mikkeller Beer Celebration 2017  
Double Passionfruit Gose. 
Żółty, całkowicie mętny trunek. Gęsty jak krem, lub nektar marchwiowo-brzoskwiniowy. Wspaniała biała piana. MARAKUJA NA MAKSA! Genialne! Rewelacyjnie pachnie, wygląda, a jeszcze lepiej smakuje. Początkowo kwaskowate od marakui, po kilku łykach i ogrzaniu w dłoniach staje się bardziej słodkie. Na ostatniej prostej można wyczuć dosłownie szczyptę soli. Soczystość na najwyższym poziomie. Gładkie, super pijalne, sesyjne. Mógłbym takich kilka pod rząd wypić. Jedno z najlepszych jasnych Ale na festiwalu.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

3541,"2017-04-30",4.6,"From notes. Enjoyed at Corbets house warming on April 23. 16 oz can. I love the all pink can. The pour on this is a thicker cloudy golden yellow with a thin white head that vanishes quickly without any lace. The aroma is out of control. The fruitiness, the tartness, a hint of wheat, a great juiciness. Fuck me. This is awesome. This is like a slightly tart passion fruit juice. My god. The flavor is even better. The tartness just leaves, with a bright fruit juice and tart sourness taking over. There is a hint of salt to it, but that just balances the juiciness and the lovely fruit. Jesus this is just incredible. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a bright carbonation and a lingeringly juicy and tart crisp aftertaste. I could drink this by the gallon. Fuck me.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Heavy passionfruit, salt, and dank grapefruits. Sour and sweet throughout each sip. Passionfruit guts and slime in the close. Medium body. One of the better veils I have had but I do love passionfruit.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
