4273,"2017-06-16",3.6,"500ml bottle purchased from Lifesource in Salem OR
$3.99
Pours a lovely sunlight yellow with a rather handsome creamy white head.
Aroma of hay, cream, vanilla and a faint grassy hop. Good.
Taste similar to aroma but with a nice mellow fruitiness..maybe hops a bit too strong but OK.
Palate is very nice medium body and high medium crbonation cleanse the palate fast.
Over all a good beer..but for me it is a tad too hoppy for a traditional helles.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"
