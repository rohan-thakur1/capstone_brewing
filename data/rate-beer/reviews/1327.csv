Pours deep, dark, clear mahogany with a small and fragile tan head.  Decent lacing is left on the glass. [3.75]
The spice level is near perfect and well-balanced. While evident in the nose and obvious up front upon tasting, the spicing slowly fades after the finish eventually leaving a chocolate malt to dominate the aftertaste. Sweet and bitter largely in balance, but a tad too sour.  No burnt flavors, but a hint of smoke in the finish. High complexity and good balance make every sip seem a little different than the one before. Plenty of dark chocolate in the nose and flavor.

M: near full body with rather lively carbonation.  I suspect Id prefer a bit less carbonation; a suspicion supported by the fact that the mouth feel improves after the beer has been in the glass for a while.

The mouth feel is thick, much like a porter or even a stout.  The flavor is almost sweet and fruity in my mouth, almost like a summer fruit flavor.  I always feel I can taste a hint of peach.  However, the aftertaste is of a nice winter porter.  Rich coffee and chocolate maltiness fills the mouth.  This beer really seems to feel like several different styles, taking the best qualities from each.  Definitely the best Shipyard beer in thats avalliable each year!","USA","MattHimself"

1327,"2006-01-17",2.3,"Penetrable filtered deep brown pour looks good with this nice looking beige film that is regular and foamy. Fake-ish floury and maraschino cherries juice, powdered fruit sweetness and strong ringwood butterscotch diacetyl blend together to make a rather chaotic and artificial feeling aroma that keeps on in mouth. I can say I was actually scared by that nose upon first sniff. The malts show mild roastiness and powdered cocoa notes that are overshadowed by watery liquid fruits - pear namely. Thankfully acidity remains limited, but the milkiness of the chocolate flavors betray an out of place lactic component. Thin bodied, unusually filtered for a winter offering, powdered light feel. I thought the ABV was higher which somewhat excuses some of its thickness lackings, but there are several improvements I can think of as far as my personnal likings go : Different yeast strain, lesser filtration, less fruitiness. It does feel wintery still, so I guess thats what they were aiming for and Im impressed by the spice absence in that regard.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

-Frail head over a rich velvety brown gown.
-A bold chocolate and fruity butterscotch perfume might bother some diacetyl-fearing noses.
-Mouthfeel is thin and filled with prickly, fat bubbles.
-Roasted malts and cocoa powder dominate the flavor profile.

What if you dig deeper?
-Green hop bitterness and ashy roasted malts lie underneath.
-Smoky hints reside within the chocolate powder.
-Cherries proliferate in the malty sweetness.
-Not able to create its own identity, this diacetyl-laced hybrid misses its target with me.

1327,"2005-12-08",3.9,"Big hiss as the cap comes off, pouring a deep brown color with safire accents when put to light.  Dense, tall and tightly packed tan bubbles form the head, and each consecutive pour seems to yield a taller and sudsier head.  Aromatic invitation to the tune of rye, buttery pumpernickel, chocolate, butterscotch, peat, hearty pecans and caramel laden peanut brittle.  Strong malt backbone rests on a scotch ale flavor appeal, warming like a single malt scotch on said winter day.  Wonderful parry of rye and hop bitterness.  Chocolate and hazelnut liqueur give a preemptive robust and nutty signature, sliding right into brazen walnuts, English toffee and sappy, spruce concocted caramel.  A little harsh and sulfurous upfront, spritsy, and then waxy with a cohesive syrupy layer subsiding across the palate.  A touch too carbonated, but the fizzles wake reveals a new layer of sweet nuances, finishing very much in line with hot buttered rum.

1327,"2005-04-15",3.1,"UPDATED: OCT 25, 2007 22 oz labeled ""limited release"" must be a winter 2004 bottle.  Pour is a clear ruby-orange-mahogany, quite a layered color effect with lasting light beige head, that is very creamy and thick, but with virtually no lacing (filtered).  Smells of dry breadiness, light roast and toasted malt, caramel, hints of cherries and candied oranges.  A little bit of stale cardboardy-mustiness.  Flavor begins quite sweet and sugary.  Basic caramel and toffee malt flavors with some English yeast fruitiness (cherries, plums, stawberries).  A subdued roastiness goes well with the creamy sweetness, but could be, perhaps, a bit more assertive.  As it warms and breathes, some of the sugary thickness recedes and leaves behind a lighter, mroe chocolatey and fruity concoction.  Hints of spice and English-like hops (dry, soily, slightly bitter).  The creamy malt sweetness is reserved for the finish now, which comes alive with depth of flavors (caramel, brown sugar, cake icing, Godiva liqueur, chocolate covered cherries, cinnamon and allspice).

Creamy chocolate notes leisurely build toward the finish alongside woody malts, dates, chalk, and Ringwood yeast. Delicate note of  unsweetened chocolate perfectly matches the brushing earthy bitterness at the back of the throat. Leaf and soil notes linger beneath a flavorsome English yeast backbone. Breathtaking English ale; if I could only say that about the rest of their line. Thanks, matta!!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

1327,"2004-02-01",3.8,"Vintage 2002: I’ve let this beer sit for many, many months now. 
 Surprisingly opaque; the body is as crimson black as moonless night on the ocean, a kaki dense sea foam head rest calmly. The nose is full with raisins, coco, and roasted coffee beans. It smells toasty and inviting.
 Wow, almost porter like. The flavor is large with notes of burnt coffee, chocolate malts, toffee, and gooey sugar rolled ripened figs. Some smoky notes of molasses, and then cola make themselves known. This is much too enjoyable! The palate is medium, somewhat prickly, the finish is a smoky coffee with a dash of nutmeg. –Surprisingly good brew -Best once it has warmed up to 60-65!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
1327,"2004-01-24",3.6,"Pours a very dark brown with a thick off-white lacy head.  Mildly roasted sweet aroma with a hint of cinnamon.  Body has a mild caramel sweetness and a dry roasty finish.  Nice subtle complexity, but still is too overwhelmingly dry.  Has a sort of typical standard micro flavor to it that's hard to describe.  Still a decent brew.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1327,"2004-01-10",4.0,"Dark brown hue with a frothy tan head and good lacing. The aroma hints of toasted caramel and mocha malts, bubblegum, nutmeg, allspice, floral hops, smoke, coffee, and earthy yeast esters. The taste start mocha sweet with an acidic, fruity and bitter undertone. The finish displays a coffee, spicy and smoky nature. Complex layers of taste which honestly shocked me a bit, wasn't expecting all that. Dry and soft mouthfeel, nice. This is a most excellent winter brew with good balance and nice use of spice components. Highly recommended.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

1327,"2003-12-30",3.7,"Very dark. Looks pretty much black. The head was light, but not white, and fizzy. Soon faded to nothing but the circle of bubbles caused by the scoring at the bottom of my Petrus Triple snifter. The nose is heavy on the apple peels. Caramel, apples and assorted fruits are dominate in the flavor, but there's a lurking char flavor that stirs things up a bit. A really interesting beer and I can't really say I've had anything like it.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

Plums, black cherries and alcohol dominate the initial taste. The midtaste reveals hints of dark chocolate, raisons, spices and a hint of orange. The aftertaste is clean and only marginally bitter.

1327,"2003-10-12",4.0,"Pleasant, mildly roasty aroma of toffee, milk chocolate, yeast and dark brown sugar, some deep, glazed berry and plummy fruit.  Dark red-brown in color, clear, with a lasting, slightly rocky ivory head.  Malty flavor profile, some roastiness, buttery toffee and cocoa, subdued bittersweet tanginess and hop spice late, with low, smoky and very slightly woody notes on the finish.  Smooth and lightly effervescent palate, reasonably full-bodied.  Mellow but having some complexity.  An interesting hybrid of a beer.  Allow proper warming for best results.

1327,"2003-05-07",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 7, 2004 Beautiful dark Tootsie Roll brown with an impressive head that slightly laces. Aroma is classic strong ale, earthy and sweet with subtle alcohol mixed in. Looks like a Porter and tastes almost like one with its smoked malt. Chocolate notes with Tettnang and Goldings providing some bitterness. Great smooth full bodied ale and probably the best I've had from Shipyard.","Cape Coral Waterfront Wonderland, Florida, USA","BierBauch"
1327,"2003-04-04",3.9,"Very dark brown, thick, medium head dies quickly to a thin topping of cream.  Delightful nose of caramel/dark chocolate and some plumminess.  Mmm Christmasy.  Flavor a bit sweeter than I expected but that's ok, very smooth, richly chocolaty, fairly mild finish.  I didn't get the roastiness or hops that many of you mention, but mine was about 6 months old or more also.  If this really is an ESA, its one of the better American examples I think.  Extremely drinkable, wonder what the ABV is?","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1327,"2003-01-18",4.1,"By far the best brew from shipyard.  Tasted more like a robust porter almost stout like.  Very deep brown almost black- with a nice brown head.  Very roasty with some chocolate flavors and well balanced with lots of different hop varieties.  Not a true english strong ale- should be classified as a robust porter.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

1327,"2002-12-14",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 20, 2003 New.........Pours a dark dark brown, almost black.  Light shines red through it.  Thick tan head which diminishes while drinking.  Aroma is very roasty, with a fairly agressive hoppiness.  Flavor is initially roasty and bittersweet, with a good hop presence, tapering off to a rich estery fruit sweetness as you continue through the glass.  Very good beer...............Old.....Very very dark and rich looking, with a rough tan head.  Extremely roasty, with a medium body.  You can tell there's a lot of hops, but they're dulled out by the vast quantities of roasted malt, and subtle spicing?  I can't really tell, but it seems like there's a little something extra to this beer.  Maybe orange peel, clove or coriander?  A bit rough and unrefined, very much a coastal new england feel.  Very very good.  Probably Shipyard's best beer.","Connecticut, USA","UnionMade"
1327,"2002-12-07",3.9,"Sweet, slightly milk chocolate aroma.  Sweet chocolate flavor thats balanced with a nice roastiness at the end.  Not sure how its categorized as it is, but it seems very much a porter to me.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
