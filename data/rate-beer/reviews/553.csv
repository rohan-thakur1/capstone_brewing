553,"2017-01-14",3.6,"Bouteille à la maison. Je filais pour revisiter certains classiques. Je trouve quil est important de se livrer à cet exercice à loccasion. Je ne me site aucunement en exemple, car je ne suis pas très assidu à cette tâche et cest justement pour ça que je le souligne lorsque je my adonne. Javais le souvenir dune bière plus sombre. Le liquide est aujourdhui assez clair. Tête qui comme dans mes souvenirs est dun blanc cassé presque jaune et formée de grosses bulles. Arômes conformes à mes souvenirs, marqués par des fruits noirs tels la mûre sauvage auxquels on aurait ajouté des cerises. Manque de rondeur et de profondeur pour mon appreciation personnelle mais ça demeure agréable. Saveurs qui me conviennent davantage où le raisin noir se marie parfaitement à un goût de pain fraîchement sorti du four. Lalcool nest pas à négliger non plus. Mince. Trop mince pour le style à mon avis. Je préfère les brunes belges avec davantage de corps et plus moelleuses. Nempêche, une très belle adaptation du style que lon oublie trop souvent.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

553,"2016-07-26",3.4,"Apparence : Brune, trouble, dépôts dans le fond, gros col beige avec une bonne rétention et laissant une fine dentelle. Effervescence semble moyenne et plutôt rapide. 

Nez : Malt, un peu dépices, un peu de fruits séchés. Intensité moyenne. 

Goût : Maltée, légère amertume (difficile à croire que cette bière nait que 10 dIBU), sucrée, mais balancée par cette amertume. 

Sensation : Effervescence moyenne, corps moyen, chaleur dalcool présente en gorge, légèrement piquante sur la langue, finale de longueur moyenne. 

O : Jai été déçu par la «simplicité» de cette bière. Très maltée, les épices et les fruits ne sont pas assez dominants à mon goût. De plus, ce malt est intéressant, sans plus. On ne retrouve pas de réelles différences entre lentrée, le mi-palais et la finale; aucune évolution des saveurs ou presque.

Thanks to tastybeer for sharing this beer which he picked up locally. I have skipped on a couple of their releases because of the price point. This one does not change my mind. Unless I was trying to increase my Canadian ticks or there was a great sale I do not see myself buying any others.

Aroma / Appearance - The deep caramel red base is warm as it glows. Absorbing most of the light it looks like a rich setting sun. Cloudy bubbly gum, candy yeast, and black cherries merge with a nutty base. Once it escapes the nice looking head it hangs like a firefly in the air before fading away.

Flavor / Palate - Nutty cherry pie, almonds, and dates give this a fruity feel. This feels mildly boozy by the end of the first pour. It is a passable dubbel but nothing special. For that reason Ill pass on the rest of the line.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Pours a rather clear ruby tinged copper amber color with a medium to large beige head.  Old fruit and gingerbread on the nose, plums and toast.  Yeast and old caramel.  Medium bodied, big and sweet, picking up a bit of an old paper and fruit leather note over the sweet malt.  Age is certainly apparent here.  Seems like this might have been great with one year on it, but at two to three its probably past its prime.  Still rather tasty though, moving into long spicy yeast with a gentle warming alcohol on the finish.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

Where did my rating go? Trying to recreate it just from the photo I took and the memories of that day. Aggressively spicy, christmassy levels. Good dark burnt roast, bitter with such roast, but tons of sugar too. Alas I drank this out of a white tea cup, and with no head it looked a bit dull. Even though there was sugar, it couldnt cover the alcohol completely, and perhaps drew attention to is, it was clearly trying to hide something, but it wasnt boozy or alcoholic, just potent. A bit harsh yet also watery. Numbing clovelike finish. A touch unsophisticated, and not something I wanted in volume as it was too aggressive. Still not bad though, and an interesting one to try.

553,"2012-01-31",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 5, 2012 (bottle from the LCBO, not aged). Served in a large wine glass @ a little below cellar temperature.  Pours a quite dark reddish brown with a large, pillowy, fine tan head which recedes slowly leaving lots of lacing.  Aroma is complex with dark fruits, a little raisin, sugar, yeast and some licorice and spice. Taste sweet molasses malt, figs and dates, some yeasty spices and a bit of hop bitterness at the finish to prevent it from being cloying. Mouthfeel is mid-weight for a Belgian, with effervescent, fine carbonation so it doesnt feel over-carbonated, and a fairly creamy finish with little detectable alcohol. I usually find doubles boring, but this is an excellent one with nice spiciness and complexity and great balance overall!","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

Im not good at identifying tastes, but Ill say the flavor here is not something Ive run into often.  This is very unique to me, and for that, I rate it high.

There is a lightness to this beer in the aroma but also a really lovely complexity that is hard to put my finger on.  A little bit of cooked fruit and a touch of brandy-like vineousness as well.  Cinnamon and white pepper over a date molasses and fig flavour.  Really nice complexity and a lightness that lends it real drinkability.

This 50cl bottle from K&L Redwood City pours a deep, clear mahogany color with reddish hues and a lasting tan head with large bubbles.  Good lacing.

Great, interesting aroma.  Spicy - cardamom stands out - with molasses, anise, sweet caramel malt, and dark fruits.  Smells really great.

Flavor is good with a lot of interesting stuff going on.  A little sweet for the style, which I didnt mind not too long ago but is now a minor detriment.  Spicy with toffee, plum, fig, raisin, licorice, molasses, and yeast.

Lots of spice, cardamon, corriander, clove, Earthy, sweet dark malts, minor fruity esters, not much of a Quebecois character to it in my mind. Very vibrant and floral, I could sniff this for hours. Flavour matches up nicely, very sweet upfront with accompanying spice and some dryness. Esters are minimal but the malty aspects are very satisfying. Does not feel like a 9% beer at all (Im sure if properly tested it most likely is not). Reminds me of Chimay Blue, but Im much more impressed with this than I ever have been with that Chimay.

553,"2009-02-11",4.0,"500 ml bottle from Marche Jovi, served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass. JA07/09.
App.:  Very deep mahogany with a large light tan froth.
  
Aroma:  Big gobs of chewy malt  brown sugar, molasses, lots of dark dried fruits, a touch nutty and woody, reminiscent of dark rum and of rootbeer, some lighter, tangier fruits such as cherries, pink bubblegum esters, rich and inviting.
  
Palate:  Medium-full body and relatively soft carbonation, slightly powdery?
  
Flav.:  Much like the nose  the malts are a little more severe with a slightly biting burnt sugar note, still lots of brown sugar and molasses, somewhat less fruity, a bit heavier on the minty rootbeer, still some sour cherries, the esters come in later; sweet but with sufficient tang and bitterness (though low) for balance.

Nez très invitant évoquant les agrumes, les épices et un soupçon de beurre de caramel, le tout très bien dosé.  Cest prometteur !  En apparence, le liquide est très foncé, mais devient rouge ambré sous la lumière.  Une mousse crémeuse et persistante sagrippe au verre.  En bouche, cest très rond et crémeux.  Curieusement, cest peu sucré pour une double dabbaye.  On remarque davantage le côté épicé/levuré.  On ressent aussi une sensation agréable sur la langue et un léger picotement probablement dû au haut taux dalcool (9%) et à une légère amertume de houblon.  Le post-goût est surtout marqué par la levure et une infime pointe danis étoilé.

553,"2008-11-27",3.7,"<b>In short: </b>An herbal and spicy (cloves mainly) belgian dark ale.  Very good.
<b>How: </b>Bottle 500ml, many many many times.  This rating for a 1 year old bottle
<b>The look: </b>Cloudy dark burgundy body topped by a persistent large beige head
<b>In long: </b>Nose is floral and spicy with tulips, lilacs, cloves and other herbs.  Taste is more of the same.  Well malted, yeasty, fluffy but overall a bit too much on the spicy/floral front.  Caramel and toffee almost harmoniously blend-in with the cloves and overall herbal/spicy nature of the beer.  For the style this beer offers very little in the way of fruity flavours.  I think there has been more than one batch of this beer because I remember having it less spicy.  As many of the past ratings testify Ive been sending a lot of these across the border and got a lot of credits for that, and with the current economic situation thats about all the credit I can get these days.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

553,"2008-06-19",4.1,"Robust mahogany glow and a brimming cap of beige, succulent and full.  Aroma of baked pears and apple fritters dappled in tarragon, cloves, mint and cinnamon.  Vibrant yeasts.  Doughy malts linger with a caramelly, dense sweetness beneath a quaint floral dusting of rose or lavender.  A bit of anise, pit fruits, and brown sugar.  The intrigue is infatuating here, as this dusky-herbal sensation of leafy spice and flowers brings it to a fairytale world of fresh meadow springtime.  But its distant, not immediate, and thats what makes it irresistable.

Flavor seems a mite sweeter, polishing that anise note into a fuller chewiness of licorice amidst a lot of brown sugar, raisin bread and fig.  Mexican chocolate, mostly bitter, black tea leaves, pear skins, bubblegum; complexity on a delirious parade.  Mid palate bittersweetness of pear skins and a return of that floral-herbal essence tempers the tendency toward oversweetness rather nicely, with little room to spare.  Duskiness of dry, earthy hot spice toward the end.  Somewhat reminiscent of curry in a strange and pleasing way.  
Body is medium to full and briskly carbonated, but never airy, which really fits my taste for this style perfectly.  Finishes with some deep fruitiness of fig and melon, then lingers on a musty, sweet molasses and licorice flavor, quite richly.  Lasting impression is of a very slightly overexcited sweetness, though the moments of brilliance in this fine example are uniquely memorable and fulfilling.

Light licorice, brown sugar, herbal flavours. Medium bodied, lightly silky and lightly fizzy mouthfeel. Another solid offering from these guys.","Halifax, Nova Scotia, CANADA","OKBeer"
553,"2007-03-22",3.8,"Pours a clear brown color with a thick bubbly beige head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma has a strong licorice feel with spices. The flavor is pretty good with its licorice - spices combo but the malt is also noteworthy with its round and rich qualities. The body is medium to full with a creamy texture and gentle carbonation. Another superb offering from this excellent brewery.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
553,"2007-03-19",2.6,"Bottle,500 ml. Clear brown color tan head that rapidly fade. Aroma of sweet spice (coriander) and fake banana candy. Quite soft taste the same as the aroma sligth bitterness in the end. Bof...","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","marcbé"
553,"2007-03-07",3.8,"Bottle: Poured a deep burgundy brown color ale with a big foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of anis is totally dominating but still well back by some strong malt. Taste is dominating by anis with some candi sugar. I thought the anis was a bit overwhelming and could have been more balance. Body was above average and alcohol was well hidden. Nicely done overall but a better calibration of spices would bring this to world class level.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

553,"2006-10-24",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 12, 2008 Rerate: Orange citrus and sweet malts are grounded pleasantly by grainy caereal notes in the nose.  A touch of alcohol is also apparent.  Clear dark brown body is topped by a generous and lasting tan, fine bubbled, dense head that laces well and lasts throughout.  Tangy citrus character keeps the big round sweetness of the malts from becoming cloying.  Bread dough like yeast character and some hints of alcohol especially in the finish.  Medium full body with strong effervescence that stops just short of becoming sharp.  A lesson in contrasts and a definite improvement over the last time i sampled it.  Tulip glass.  Cellar temperature.  Bottle (Rahman, Jun-08).   Original Rating (7-2-6-2-12=2.9): Strong bitter orange and coriander spiciness greet the nose along with some round, sweet malt character.  Plenty of chunky yeast in suspension in the otherwise fairly clear, deep brown body that is topped by a low, large bubbled, partial cover of tan head.  Strong chocolate and orange flavours with spices that battle the mild bitterness.  Sweetness is somewhat cloying and alcohol is fairly notable.  Medium body with doughy texture and somewhat low carbonation.  Bottle sampled at the post-Mondial tasting 2006.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
553,"2006-08-28",3.6,"Bottle shared with HogTownHarry, GregClow, jerc, mds & tupalev -- courtesy of tupalev. Pours a clear ruby-brown with a small diminishing off-white head. Interesting aroma of spices, licorice, toffee, malt and yeast. Flavour: wow, thats a little odd, I dont like it as much as the aroma but its still good: Sweet malt, spices, yeast, licorice and dark fruit -- a little boozy but not overly so. Medium bodied. Quite a unique beer, I liked it.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","blankboy"
553,"2006-08-27",3.6,"Bottle. Pours a cherry-mahogany coloured body with floaties and a small off-white head. The aroma is quite interesting with lots of spice, licorice, cinnamon, toffee, and butterscotch. Soft malty body - cereal type grains, spicey licorice, and caramel dark malts. I found the aroma to be a lot nicer than the flavour. Still nice though.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"
553,"2006-08-23",4.0,"Bottle shared with blankboy, HogTownHarry, jerc, tupalev & mds - courtesy of tupalev. Deep ruby-brown with a small mocha head. Interesting aroma mixing dark fruit juice, licorice, spices (nutmeg? clove?) and a hint of yeast. Flavour - nice! Sweet, fruity malt to start, warming in the middle, turning roastier as it warms, with a spicey, peppery finish. Fantastic!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
553,"2006-08-21",4.0,"Bottle shared with the regular crew including MDS, courtesy of myself.  Really interesting aroma:  sweet candy, incense, yeast, licorice, and lots of floral notes - I loved it.  Dark brown, foamy thick brownish head.  Nice taste:  lots of spicy dark malt, soft floral notes, and some alcohol.  Wonderful spicy finish.  Complex and a unique take on the style.  Outstanding.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"
553,"2006-08-20",3.5,"Bottle. Dark brown body, moderate tan head and lacing. Big interesting aroma, various fruits, light anise and root notes. Bit of bitterness to the flavour, sweet malt middle with dry anise bite to the finish that lingers. Thin for the style.  Pretty interesting, but lacks the coherence needed to transcend the average.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
553,"2006-08-18",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 20, 2006 Bottle (500ml).  Shared with blankboy, GregClow, jerc, mds and tupalev, blankboys bottle.  Clear deep ruby with a decent foamy beige head.  Complex, unique aroma - anise, toffee malt, various fruits like apricot and plum, quite yeasty with a virtual miasma of sweet pungent spices blending with the malt, I got more apple character as it warmed.  The taste was a little more straightforward, very thick sweet brown sugar malt, sweet spices, plentiful yeast, fruity but oddly no anise in the flavour - alcohol bitterness emerges in the finish.  Nice thick body, sticky mouthfeel with an acceptable liveliness, slightly alcoholic and a hint of astringency from all the spice - a really good dubbel, nice and malty - one of the better brews of the tasting for my money.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
553,"2006-07-29",3.9,"A brown ale with nice mahogany hues and an extra thick light moka head. In aroma, wonderful candy sugar mix in with orange pulp with notes of nutmeg. In mouth, a ricjh alcohol gives way to a sweet candy malt, with hints of choclate, nutmeg,  and oranges. Slightly nutty notes. An excellent offering from Fred.

553,"2006-07-15",3.0,"This is a strange tasting double not similar to a belgian double.  The bottle I had in Montreal was very acidic both in smell and taste.  Maybe this bottle was bad but the acidic taste was so prominent that it made what should be a smooth malty ale more difficult to drink.","Carlsbad, California, USA","IPALover"

553,"2006-07-07",3.4,"Cloudy dark brown hue, with a tan-colored head, but falling quickly, the nose is one of dark dried fruits of plums, raisins, figs, with a candied orange peels note, with some cinnamon, nutmeg and anise spiciness, hint of dark coffee, roasted and caramelized malts in the aroma follows through on a medium-bodied palate with an acidic candied tangerine skin character, caramelized and roasted malts, with a hint of molasses, anise spiciness, orange peels fruitiness, leading towards a mild bitter chocolate, and a slight burt toast roastiness finish.","montréal, Quebec, CANADA","rederic"
553,"2006-06-17",3.7,"Post-Mondial tasting at Goldoraks pad, from 500 ml bottle(s).  Hazy mahogany with a bit of lasting brown head....lots of spice in the nose, almost an overload, with anise and allspice and orange peel all strutting their stuff, to the point where the fine caramel malt seems to be crying out to be noticed....on the tongue a two-part adventure, with thick sweet near-syrupy caramel at the front quickly dissipating as huge fiery spices, ginger and more anise and Mexican chocoalte show up....creamy, soft carbonation and a remarkably long, lingering finish with the spices staying with you as long as seems possible....","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

553,"2006-06-13",3.7,"Bottle. Dark brown muddy body with average carbonation and a thin beige bubbly head. Awesome malty aroma with fruity (plum, grape, strawberry, citrus) notes. Texture is smooth and taste hides the alcohol very well. Aside the malty and hoppy flavors, it carries yeasty and fruity hints as well. Ends with a decently warming finish. Another more than enjoyable beer from Charlevoix. Thanks PrimeMinister for that sample!","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"

553,"2006-06-04",3.4,"Initially light beige head has difficulty to stay on place and leaves a hazy dark brown-mahogany colored body. Pleasant mouthfeel has a certain airy character from the small and compact bubbles, yet keeps a good roundness and creaminess from the excellent malt extraction. In terms of flavors, it takes some time and warming up to develop fully, but once that is done, it is an explosion of anise that is quickly joined by prunes, figs and cherries/blackberries though it has nowhere near the fruit concentration I expected, namely thick flavors of dates and grapes. It remains all through surprisingly dry, perhaps it did attenuate fast after the bottling. Vague hints of powdery chocolate support this relatively low profile sweetness. Seems to still be hiding a bit of its potential and complexity.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
