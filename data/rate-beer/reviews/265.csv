265,"2008-11-27",3.5,"(300 ml bottle from Lous Beverage Barn (I asume I have the correct sake here although I dont recall the word ""Tokusen"" on the label) Pours clear with a very slight golden tint. Aroma of bread, yeast, rice and alcohol. Mouthfeel light, thin, lightly dryish. Lacing consists of some droplets along inside of glass. Flavor of bread and alcohol with overtones of yeast and rice. Perhaps less sweet than some other sakes Ive had. Nice and easy to drink. Served chilled.","Boothbay, Maine, USA","porterhouse"

265,"2007-12-27",3.5,"300 ml bottle from City Market in Burlington, VT (December 2007), consumed from the fridge in a White Winter Winery glass.  Extremely clear and still, just a faint oily haze to it; very faint legs in the glass indicate little sugar.....more pronounced ""riciness"" in the nose, reminds me of the home-made horchata at a Mexican restaurant I used to visit frequently in Chicago; hints of almonds....smooth, lightly sweet body, less tropical-fruity than most, a bit of almond and vanilla in the ricey character, hint of alcohol at first grows fairly strong towards the finish, but the dryness of palate really works here and the overall character is a bit reminiscent of gin or a high-quality vodka, without the burn....elegant and quite pleasant.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
265,"2007-06-30",3.3,"Courtesy redlight.  Pours clear.  Smell is kind of bready, yeasty, a little nutty even.  The taste is defintely kind of bready or doughy, if those are words, with just a touch of some light vanilla I think.  I find it kind of difficult to characterize flavors in sake.  The differences are kind of subtle.  I still enjoyed it though.  I am more and more becoming a fan of sake.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"

265,"2006-12-12",2.4,"300ml bottle... Looks like water. Vanilla, raw almond, alcoholic nose. Lightly sweet, lightly tangy. A bit thin, actually. Medium-bodied. Finishes alcohol-warm then very dry. Im not a fan. Probably the last sake Ill try.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
265,"2006-11-08",2.9,"Clear, no color. Koji, Vanilla, almonds and slight alcohol in the nose. Slightly thick feeling (for a Honjozo), Id expect a bit lighter, fruitier and aromatic for this style.
Mild nutty flavor up front, a bit harsh in the follow with an alcohol burn going down. Not a top notch sake (IMHO) but certainly not a bad one either.","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"
265,"2006-05-19",3.5,"From a bottle at Sushi Joy- Plymouth, MA. Dusky floral aroma of light plum and fragant blossom. A touch of tangy soy. An off-clear pour. Flavor has a generally sweetly cured alcohol with light herbaceous lemon, heavy coconut and some touches of plum or pear. A heavier toasted wood develops from teh depths, with a hint of bamboo and coral. Alcohol isnt too overbearing, instead gentle, but warming and fragrant in the nostrils. Finishes with a touch of tart lemon on the palate.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
265,"2006-01-05",2.5,"mildly sweet aroma some alcohol.  Reall smooth drink but kinda light on the palate it had sweet flavor but it seemed watereed down too much.  hand a nice dry finish and the alcohol seemed to be well hidden in the flavor.","New York, USA","crazyvin"
265,"2005-09-27",3.4,"Medium bodied - smooth and slightly thick.  Aroma is sweet and vanilla.  Taste is full bodied and changes over time - vanilla, oak, some alcohol, sweet candy (yeah, I agree, theres a hint of caramel here, especially when warmer).  Finish is dry then followed by a lingering sweetness.  Nice mellow sake.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
