3620,"2016-08-20",3.7,"Cask at Barvolo. Pours a clear, copper caramel with a one finger, creamy cask head. Aroma has mild notes of caramel, bread, slight roast and dark fruits, and a slight nuttiness. Taste is balanced very well with notes of caramel, cola, nuts, bread, slight roast and darker malts, and a drawn out, dark caramel ending. Medium body with a low, Cask carbonation.

Clear copper body with a bubbly tan head.

Smooth thin body with light carbonation.

Mild bitterness. Lingering, moderately hoppy aftertaste. Some bready malts in the background. 

Surprisingly weak aroma given the flavor.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
3620,"2015-09-28",2.8,"cask at the brewpub. Coppery amber. Whiteish bubbly head. Very sweet, candy-like aroma, like sniffing a bag of jelly beans, plus floral hops. Tastes similar.

3620,"2011-07-10",3.3,"On tap @ The Henry House in Halifax, enjoyed as part of a tasting tray. Slightly darker than the Best Bitter, owing to the hop oils Im guessing.

The flavour is crisp up front, balanced between moderate sweet malts and floral, citrusy hops. On the palate, it is light-medium in body with a smooth, watery texture and soft carbonation.

3620,"2008-08-10",3.0,"Objectively speaking:
The dry-hopped version of the best bitter. Hoppier, but less easy to drink.

I like:
Keeps more or less the same authenticity in the malt profile than the best bitter. 

I dislike:
Its fresh hops bouquet does not provide much. Were simply getting further away from Britain, its sharper without feeling fresher and even becomes a bit less easy to drink in my mind. More intense, but it becomes harder to capt the toasty nuances from the malts.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
3620,"2008-07-14",3.8,"Cask sample at the Victory - poured a murky but bright plum colour with a small off-white head.  Really nice looker.  Aromas of citrusy hops and dark fruits, but nothing overpowering - incredibly well-balanced and enticing on the nose.  Flavour is wonderfully refreshing, with fruit black tea, and definitely moreish.  Good bitter punch in the finish, and the dry-hopping is a step up from their regular (still very good) bitter.  A wonderful beer - one I would get regularly if more widely available.","Parkdale, Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","VeloVampire"
