1805,"2016-09-29",4.2,"Thank you kermis! 750 ml. bottle split by 5. 2013 Vitage. Black with a small but decent tanned head. Nose is rich vanilla, okay, sugar, molasses, pleasantly boozy with low sour cherry qualities  the brandy I presume. Body is a bit thinned out, it shows some ager, light oxidation, thick sweet vanilla & oak with low cherry (brandy once again?), sweet sugar, lightly vinous with molasses. Feels way lower than 12 % ABV. Rather thin for ABV, Pretty good stuff but age shows, body doesnt fully carry. Thick vanilla & oak affair is great as usual. Cherry not is unusual but interesting. Still very nice despite signs of age.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

1805,"2013-12-17",3.6,"Bottle. Rating from notes. Of course, I was excited to try this and thankfully given the opportunity by a good friend. Topless Wytch isnt the FFF beer you dream about, but it never disappoints. There was probably a time in my life where I would be afraid of cognac barrels but, you know what? I probably sucked back then. Pours a rich black with a small beige head. Aroma of booze, malt, dark fruits, mild sweetness. Touches of barrel and alcohol. Some cocoa, some peppery notes. Flavor is mostly booze with lots of figs, raisins, and other dark fruit notes. Cognac is there, and is mildly interesting on the flavor profile. Some wood and vinous notes. Medium bodied, oily texture, with light carbonation. Finishes fairly long. Overall, not disappointed.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"

1805,"2013-08-25",3.8,"Bottle shared by raveskdr. Thanks Chris!

The beer is dark brown, approaching black. Thin, tan head with minimal lacing. The aroma brings roast, oak, vanilla, dark fruits, spice. Lots of flavor. Very potent. An almost tannic aspect from the oak barrels. An unorthodox flavor and a bit different than what I had expected, though by no means in a negative way. Some alcohol heat in the finish, but this seems to have calmed down quite a bit based on reviews early this year. A solid beer from an outstanding brewery.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
1805,"2013-07-15",3.6,"Bottle from January consumed just the other day....pours a darker than cola hue with auburn edges and topped with a thin film of medium beige head.... Aroma of cocoa, mild toasted roast with a mild around if sweet dark fruit and almost a cognac like spirit involved... Flavors are cocoa, dark fruit with more of an emphasis on the former. More toasty notes to pair with a mild roast aspect. Semi-lively prickly carbonation with James just shy of medium bodied. Not bad and drank easier than i would have expected. Barrel is present but rather mild overall.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

1805,"2013-03-26",3.6,"750 ml bottle bought from the brewpub (Munster, IN). Pours a rich deep blackish hue, richer deep dark body with brownish ruby edges and bottom showing some glow. A frothy tannish head atop laces small, rings ok. Aromas are oaky, cognac or brandy offers some fruit, vanilla, some thinness, soap, and gentle roast, cocoa, pretzels and toasty biscuits. Soapy, fruity, and a Brandy appeal. Fruity, apple and oak, vanilla, a touch sticky. Initial is brandy, some mellow roast, toast, and biscuits. Vanilla, more brandy, spirit, and toffee. A bit thinner, the apparent Brandy barrel (even though they say its Bourbon) really offers some richer flavors up front. Middle is a bit toasty, cocoa, some gentle Tootise Roll. A bit roasty as we round the corner, some warmth, richer oak and tannic qualities. Vanilla, oak, touches of apple, gentle spirit. This isnt hot, it is a bit thin, the spirit isnt offensive, but its there. I was quite surprised by the Brandy element even though they swear its bourbon. Interesting. Finish is a bit dry, tannic, vanilla, brandy. Some gentle roast and toast. Ok.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
