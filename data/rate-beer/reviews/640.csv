640,"2014-12-08",3.5,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2015 draft, nitro, you know, this was a little gimmicky but i liked it. A sweet milk chocolate yoohoo type stout with no roast at all. Tons of chocolate, not something i would take hom a growler of but it was enjoyable.

640,"2014-07-22",4.0,"Draft. Listed at only 4.2% abv - wow theres a lot going on here for such a small beer.Clear Dark brown with ruby edges. Tight bubbly beige head. Lighter body. Moderate roastiness. Mild bitterness. Lightly creamy. Nothing overpowering. Roast stands out as mellow cocoa compliments. Milk chocolate. Superb balance and drinkability. Good stuff as always here.","Arizona, USA","beerbaaron"
640,"2014-05-02",3.5,"On tap at Arizona Wilderness. Pours a deep black with a nice mocha head. Aromas of dry chocolate powder, light roasted almond, vanilla and pie crust. taste is thin...as should be expected of lighter milk stout like this. tasted almost like chocolate milk. Very low hop bitterness...creamy mouthfeel...light chocolates. Decent stout.","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"
640,"2014-04-20",3.7,"On nitro. Very dark brown with beautiful cascading pour giving way to a frothy beige head. Aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and cream. Taste of roasted malts, creamy chocolate, hint of coffee and milk sugar. Medium bodied, very low carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. Goes down way to easy. Think of this as a Guinness with more pronounced flavors, good beer!","Calgary, CANADA","maley1"
640,"2014-02-02",3.3,"Not a fan of this one. After the other two beers I had here (superstition & woolsey) this was clearly not in the same league. Thin with little added flavor to make it interesting.","Minnesota, USA","mnmike"
640,"2014-01-30",4.1,"Not God's gift to stouts, but it's good. First. Who makes a stout with an ABV of just 4.2?!? That is the big problem really. This is watery. Flavors are there, and sufficiently complex, but quite subdued. The brewers were just a tad too timid.

640,"2013-10-30",4.2,"Pours a black color with tan head. Aromas of roast, chocolate, and oats. Flavors of chocolate, roasted malts and sugar. Nice stout for sure.","Arizona, USA","kcorum10"
640,"2013-10-30",4.5,"Near-black pour with nice lacing. Aroma of coffee and bitter chocolate. Flavors of more butter chocolate, coffee, and toffee.","Arizona, USA","JustDrinkIt"
640,"2013-10-16",3.9,"It pours with a nice dark body that supports a light mocha colored head. The modest aroma offers up notes of dark roasted malts, a slight chocolate note and then faint notes of burnt malts and a bit of a dark roasted coffee sense. The taste begins nice and roasty with burnt malts, dark roasted malts and then it moves into a quick pulse of chocolate before a thin river of malt sweetness joins the fun. Into the finish the roastiness ramps up and gets pretty dark to burnt malts and then those linger into the after taste. Nice big roastiness here.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
640,"2013-10-06",4.0,"On draft at the brewery in a snifter. Murky black in color with a off-white head. Aroma of burnt coffee, biscuit, very roasted malt, and a touch of woody anise. Dry taste of dark-roast coffee, some dark chocolate, and a bark-like bitterness. It doesnt have an overload of typical lactose-sweetness of a milk stout. Very dry mouthfeel. It reminds me a bit of a baby Abyss without the barrel treatment. Intriguing brew.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
640,"2013-10-01",4.6,"Beautiful roasty aroma. Taste of slight chocolate, and roaster barley. Nice smooth mouthfeel. This is easily one of the best from the wilderness boys.

640,"2013-10-01",4.6,"Poured a dark chocolate color with a medium brown head. Up front aroma is dark chocolate, plums, lactose, roast and hints of molasses. Flavor is loaded with high quality chocolate, perfect amount of roast, light coffee notes. Jesus this is outrageously great.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
