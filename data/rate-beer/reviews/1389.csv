It is awesome to take your growler to the source and get it filled but the best experience is to sit in the biergarten with a few friends and enjoy the awesome food and atmosphere at the monastery.","","rodboro"

1389,"2010-04-21",5.0,"I travel a lot (usually 75,000 to 150,000 miles per year air miles).  I have been in almost a hundred countries and many hundreds of towns.  Wherever I go, I try the local brews and ask the natives what their recommendations are.  After tasting more than a thousand different beers, there is one I always come back to as the best taste in beer anywhere.  The Kreuzberg Klosterbrauerei beer is the absolute best beer anywhere.  I first tried in 1979, came back many times from 1982-1988, and several times in the the 1990s and well over 30 times in the 2000s.  Beer can be bought only at the Klosterbrauerei in one or half liter steins or taken with you in large bottles or kegs but this beer does not come in bottles, cans and is not sold in your local markets.  Many park near the bottom of the mountain and walk up the mountain to enjoy this beer and the delious German food. Once you have tried, I am sure you will agree, it is well worth the walk up the mountain.","USA","BruceT"

Very fresh hops with some nice, sulfury hops. Opaque mug made it hard to judge colour: dark amber with a lasting white, lacy cover.

Kreuzberg is definitely the best and a legend among several of my buddies.  The whole experience is spectacular with the monastery and food.  My wife met me in Germany for my R&R from Iraq in 2004.  We stayed in one of the rooms that they have at the monastery.  They are very affordable, modern, and clean.

The brewery itself is amazing, and well worth the trip to the WasseKupe.  This particular beer I had in a 1 liter stein.  It was cold and malty which was perfect for the summer day after the long hike up the hill to the kloister.
