595,"2016-09-05",3.7,"Picked up single 12-oz bottle from Rileys Wine of the World in Madison, Wisconsin. Pours a semi-clear dark amber brown colored brew with a thick off-white head that slowly dissipates and leaves behind some excellent lacing. Aroma of golden and caramel malt, maple candied walnuts, a touch of candi sugar and dark pitted fruits. Taste is full bodied with plenty of carbonation. Flavors of dark pitted fruits, Belgian yeast, a hint of candi sugar and raisins. Finish has a sparkly carbonated Belgian ale aftertaste with some dark pitted fruits and a slowly disappearing yeast aftertaste. A solid Belgian dubbel overall.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"

595,"2015-05-07",3.7,"12 oz. Bottle to round out Willrunforbeers afternoon cellar clean out. Looks like a bottle date of 05/14 stamped on the neck. Dirty brown color, thin lasting head. Aroma is real nice, spiced apples, raisins and figs. The flavor does reflect the aroma with dark fruit being deep and rich without it becoming to sugary sweet. Yeast helps balance the level of malts. Body is appropriate for the style and has a light spice in the finish. Very nicely crafted from this brewer yet again. Fine example of the style.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

Not as sweet as the candied sugar ingredients suggest. Harsh, musty and boozy on the finish with hints of raisins.

595,"2014-11-09",2.8,"12 oz. bottle, consumed on 11-5-14. I have been aging this one for a little while, somewhere between six months and a year, Im guessing. Im not going to bother to research exactly when it was released. Mineral, metallic, plastic aroma features a candy sugar scent. Smells like a cheap metal railing. Fresh and yeasty yet simultaneously rusty smell. Overall, a subpar aroma. Pours a dark amber to medium brown with a large amount of long-lasting, golden taupe head that is fluffy. Quite good looking in the glass. Hazy liquid. Light effervescence. Gorgeous and hard to beat appearance, except that it produces only a small amount of lacing. Better lacing would have earned it a 5 for appearance. Spicy, Christmas-y taste features flavors of tobacco, leather, bran muffin, sugary apple, dull metal, and dirt. Low in flavor but not bad. Medium body. Lively, frothy, and soft in the palate. Produces some alcohol heat in the back of the throat. Overall, disappointing. Pretty bad smell and underwhelming flavor and palate effects. It does look good, but its unsophisticated and underdeveloped. New Glarus has produced some really good stuff in its Thumbprint line, but it also has had a surprisingly large number of clunkers. This is one of the clunkers. Dont be fooled by the generous ratings from people who dont have the heart to knock a New Glarus beer; this one is not very good at all.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
595,"2014-11-05",3.7,"12 ounce bottle

A special treat carted home from the GTMW weekend, this dubbel represents a typical New Glarus Thumbprint release. Fairly priced with a flavor profile that is likely to hold up for at least a few months, it should find its way into the fridge or cellar of anyone who wants to know why New Glarus continues to be a huge influence in the craft beer movement.

Aroma / Appearance - A rich ruby red base flows with a sticky resistance. Dusty white head adds a nice accent. Underneath waves of nutty caramel, walnuts, and bittersweet chocolate merge with effortless direction from the base malts.

Flavor / Palate - Carbonated Dr Pepper tickles the tongue. A second later a burst of cherries, iced tea leaves, and residual toffee contribute more depth. A vinous texture completes the experience as it winds to a warm full bodied conclusion. A top notch winter warmer may not last that long as I look at my remaining stash of bottles.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Flavor is simple but pretty good - residual candi sugar sweetness dominates, some banana and clove from the yeast and a bit of caramel malt. Finish is semi-dry with lingering flavors of yeast and hop. Pretty good American take on a difficult style - I agree with other reviewers that cellaring this would help to dry it out a bit and bring more complexity. Good, but this will be great a year from now.","San Francisco, California, USA","asedzie"

595,"2014-06-25",3.4,"12 oz bottle from Hilltop Brewery (New Glarus, WI). Pours a deep darker copper ruby hue, gentle haziness with darker middle. Lively carbonation atop shows cakey light brown head. Firmer layer dies to a decent film eventually, cakey layer laces well enough. Aromas are firmer red fruit, touches of prune and plum meet black cherry, a bit of toffee and toast. Carmelized and biscuity malts, some sweeter touches of red currant, a gentle yeastiness and Belgian spice. Fruity and sweeter than expected with some Belgian candi sugar. Initial is well carbonated, medium bodied with red fruit, plum and some dried fruit. Touches of currant, cherry and caramel malts. Biscuits, some estery fruits and toffee. Well carbonated and a bit fuzzy, gentle Belgian yeast and spiciness, lighter body (though still sweet) from all these effects. A bit of banana, more toast and bready/carmelized malt elements give some more expected Dubbel elements. Lingering red fruit, not into the cough syrup realm but it hovers close by. A lot of red/stone/dark fruit elements really come through on this thing. Coupled with that well carbonated body, a bit of spiciness, toast, gentle carmelized candi sugar finish. Faint black olive lingers at times as well back there and on the palate. This is ok, considerably different than expected but still fairly solid. Gorgeous pour, a touch more body and depth, apple and banana flashes and estery life at times after we get much further in. Perhaps a bit overattenuated? Or maybe Im just used to the plethora of under attenuated Dubbels made here by US Brewers? Something is different, the nose seems a bit dead as well.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Starts with good fullness and effervescent carbonation with bready sweetness, some banana esters, and dark fruits before a drier toasted finish. Pretty true to style and well-balanced.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
595,"2014-05-02",3.7,"Bottle thanks to Jstax ! Pours rusty brown color with a two finger eggshell foam. Lots of mild warming spice on the nose, caramel malt, bready, burnt sugar. Palate follows with a soft fuzzy mouthfeel. Layers of date fruit, french toast, vanilla, molasses and prune. Pretty good representation of style.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
595,"2014-05-01",3.7,"Deep, clear red body and a thick tan head. Grains, some grassiness, maybe even a hint of maybe mushroom. Predominantly sour, some bitterness. Incredibly dry palate, medium body, quite effervescent between its acidity and carbonation. Quite nice.

595,"2014-04-25",2.7,"Dark brown red with a thick v thick head from bottle. Aroma is mild alcohol and grapes, like a wine, red wine. Theres a hair in it. Wtf? Flavor is mild and a little sour.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Vir4030"
595,"2014-04-21",3.7,"Purchased at Woodmans in Kenosha, WI; enjoyed at home prior to watching Blackhawks playoff hockey, cautiously nervous. Appearance is a rich mahogany-esque amber with a moderate off white head that laces to the glass. Looks classy. Aroma of Belgian candi sugar, light spice, yeast. Taste is rich and syrupy, sweet, moderate caramel notes, its good but not my fav from this great brewery.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"
595,"2014-04-20",3.2,"Bottle, bonused by Bacterial -- thanks! Pours brown with ruby highlights. Aroma hits me first with an almost artificial cherry -- like cherry wrapped in plastic thats begun to melt. Caramel, toffee, and then the fruit again. Hard for me to get past that. Medium body, sweet and syrupy. Sticky. Overall: not my favorite from them, but I still maintain my standing order to try anything these folks brew. This also reminds me I should revisit some of the dubbels I enjoyed in the days before I was rating, though.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
595,"2014-04-18",3.9,"Bottle. pours clear reddish hazel, large creamy beige head, dissipates slowly, nice lacing. Aroma is, nutty, malty, caramel. Medium sweet, miNimal bitterness. Rich and creamy, quite tasty.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
595,"2014-04-14",3.7,"Hazy brownish color, like good cider. Good amount of tan head. Aroma of fruit, spice, and some booze. Taste is very much a Belgian beer. Great yeast flavor, caramel, fruit, raisins, some molasses. Full bodied, with a sticky and fizzy finish. Another great beer from New Glarus.

595,"2014-04-06",3.8,"Bottled. Poured slightly cloudy medium orange with a tall, fluffy beige head. The aroma picked up biscuity and raisin notes upfront, with accents of vanilla, cloves, and charred oak.. came across a touch airy, but otherwise quite nice. The flavor found a heavier dose of raisin and molasses at the core, with warm spices, oak, and a bit of vinous character around.. finished spicy and a touch heavy. Medium-bodied with fairly high carbonation on the palate.. this came together well, and I think a bit of time will make it even better.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
595,"2014-04-05",4.0,"Bottle thanks to joshmcg000. Hazy, dark copper tinted brown pour with a tall, fluffy beige head that has great retention and leaves very nice lacing. Aroma is chocolate, dark fruit, Candi Sugar, tree fruit, sweet cherries, fruity floral notes, a little banana bread, a touch of lemon curd and nice, deep toasty pastry notes. Flavor is chocolate, dark toast, roast, wine soaked dark fruit, light nutty notes, roasted stone fruit, spice, banana, bubble gum, dates, caramel then some floral notes, crusty bread, toffee and spice to the finish. Medium body, creamy to syrupy feel, with a medium, blanketing carbonation and off dry finish. Really good stuff, one of the better Dubbels I have had. It really opens up around cellar temp, which is probably how it should be drank.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"
595,"2014-04-05",3.4,"Pours a deep amber with a finger of frothy head. Aroma is intensely malty with notes of brown sugar, stone fruit, and spicy yeast. Taste follows quite well with a medium body, an oily finish and overall sweet taste. As it warmed I enjoyed it more.","Madison, USA","jmcgavin12"
595,"2014-04-04",3.9,"Pours hazy to dark tan very nice looking. Aroma is heavy Belgian yeast. Very heavy yeast flavor up front, little bit of nice spice. It has very nice active carbonation that fits it well, little bit of sweetness to. Sharp hoppy bitterness on the backend. Pretty good","Iowa, USA","joshmcg000"
595,"2014-04-02",2.7,"The color is an opaque brown with a large light tan head, which is appealing, but the aroma smells stale bread, which isnt appetizing. The taste is mildly sour, slightly sweet, and a touch umami, and the palate fuses a medium body, average carbonation, thick texture, and a sour finish.","Columbia, Missouri, USA","EtTuCthulhu"
595,"2014-04-01",3.3,"Murky brown-orange pour. Nose is brown sugar, Belgian yeast, candy, light apple, and faint banana. Flavor is initially Belgian candy and cherry that finishes quickly to burnt biscuit and toasted malt. Lingering burnt biscuit and faint roasted malt. Fairly dry and highly carbonated. Initial impression was that this was a bit choppy, but as it warmed, so did I to the overall picture. Still, certainly could use some age, mellowing of components","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"

595,"2014-03-23",3.8,"12oz bottle. Rating #10...its official. Murky burgundy-amber body. Creamy off-white/beige head. At first I was disappointed with this beer, because it didnt taste like your run of the mill Dubbel. It is lighter is some respects, leans into the amber malt a little. Spicy intense yeast tones. The more I sip at it though, I have to give it props. This has classic Belgian nuances, complexities. The luscious champagne mouthfeel is there. Like a Trappist interpretation of a Dubbel, going for greatness, not content to make a standard offering. Pretty solid beer.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"

595,"2014-03-16",3.0,"Bottle - Murky ruby-brown pour with a foamy light tan head. Nose is plasticy--thats the dominant aspect, with plum, raisin, a bit of bready yeast, and even some light spicing. Taste has the same plasticy note, though not as strong, with yeasty bread, and lightly spiced plum. A bit of boozy sharpness on the finish, but not much. Its not bold and luscious, but as with the Chocolate Abbey NG made previously, I expect this one could use 3-6 months in the cellar to come together better. As it stands its fairly tasty, but the smell and the disjointed nature of the taste mean its more middling than magnificent.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
595,"2014-03-16",4.0,"This pours a cloudy, burnt amber color with a slight off-white head. The aroma is mildly sweet with malts and yeast. The taste is quite strong with malt and yeast. There is a full volume with a decent amount of carbonation. It finishes with a bit of a spice after taste and lingering yeast. A very interesting brew from New Glarus.","Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA","Lemke10"
595,"2014-03-15",3.1,"(bottle) Pours a semi-hazy brown color with an off-white head that quickly settles to a medium height. Scent is pretty subtle post-pour, with a subtly dominant aroma of freshly cut plum carrying the torch. There is also some dessicated fruit components flitting in on the fringes of the sniff. Perhaps some dried apple slices and the case could be made for cherries, although it may be flimsy. Subtle hint of Vics vapo-rub. Odd. More normal scents of bread and toffee show up as well.  Further warming reveals some black cardamom. The flavor, as with most New Glarus forays into Belgian territory, falls flat, and the rounded breadiness of the yeast seen in prime Belgian examples is notably absent here. In its place is a slightly tart and sharp aspect to the finish which is a bit jarring for the style. There are some spicy aspects to this such as cinnamon (warming, not stinging) and perhaps clove. Again, the dried apple and plum arrive along with some caramel. As Ive tasted in the past, and currently am tasting here, NGs attempts at Belgian styles generally fall flat. This is a middling rendition of what can be an intriguing style.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
595,"2014-03-14",3.7,"12oz bottle to snifter. Beautiful deep ruby red with thick creamy off white head. Candi sugar, yeast, and dark fruits. Smooth carbonation with just a little bite. Everything I like about dubbels but Im getting a little bit of odd plasticy aroma and Im usually not very sensitive to aroma. Otherwise its spectacular.","Erin, Wisconsin, USA","demmbonz"
595,"2014-03-13",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2014 Pours an attractive dark ruby reddish, light brownish amber. Medium, creamy light tan head, fairly lasting with lacing. Belgian yeast, spicy, fruity, banana, little dark fruit, brown sugar, caramel. Modest sweetness. Finishes dry and doughy with a touch a sweetness and spice. Big medium body, very soft, creamy. Alcohol is well hidden. Very smooth, rounded, balanced. Oozes quality all around. For a fault, if anything maybe its a bit too subtle and understated, if you can even consider that a fault. A dangerously drinkable, approachable dubbel.","Arizona, USA","beerbaaron"
