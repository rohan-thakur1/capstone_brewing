2630,"2015-07-02",3.1,"Can from combini. Pretty light body, green banana, mildly creamy, honey bread, touch of lemon, sweet finish. Fairly basic and unimpressive wheat brew, but quite drinkable and widely available at an ok price.","","biirusaikou"
2630,"2015-06-18",3.0,"350ml Can. Pours out slightly cloudy. Short white head. Aroma has a decent bubblegum wheaty hit. Taste is lemon, malty, slight banana notes. Palate slightly oily. Decent wheat beer; no real off notes but not much to set it apart.","Cheshire, ENGLAND","Nocturne"
2630,"2015-05-18",3.1,"Smooth yeasty beginning. Fresh, clove with not too much yeast. Easy to drink, smooth. Nice dry, very fresh, not too deep. But quite nice. Clove, smooth, no bitterness.","Wuppertal, GERMANY","Erzengel"
2630,"2015-05-06",2.7,"Can from Family Mart in Asagaya. Poured into an English tulip pint. Pours a clear pale golden straw color with a modest white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Very assertive clove aroma with faint aromas of banana and bubblegum present as well. Light body with a watery and grainy texture similar to a pale lager. A kristallweizen for sure, but just too bland.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"
2630,"2015-04-18",3.0,"Hazy, yellow and brownish colour with a white head. Very mild aroma with some hops and sweet notes. Sweet taste, it has a hint of banana bread to it. Soft mouthfeel, not a whole lot of carbonation. Decent overall.","Oulu, FINLAND","minihame2"
2630,"2015-04-06",3.2,"Can from Yamaya, Hitachinaka, Ibaraki, Japan. A hazy golden yellow coloured pour with a medium white head on top. Yeasty, spice aroma. Tastes similar, spice, yeasty, clove, wheaty. Quite pleasant.","Northwood, Greater London, ENGLAND","evergreen0199"
2630,"2015-03-21",2.6,"Pours a bit hazy, looks pale and watery. Some foam that is gone fast. Aroma has nothing special, has some wet cardboard, sour, not really nice. Taste is slightly better, has a bit of spices, body is almost decent actually. However, again a beer that is maybe OK to drink but that lacks character and is not really pleasant.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
2630,"2014-11-26",3.0,"Milchig trüb, goldgelb, ordentliche weiße Schaumkrone. Aber das ist doch kein Kristallweizen? Geruch leicht hefig, fruchtig, bananig, typisch Weizen. Geschmack hefig, bananig fruchtig, Ester, süß bananiger Abgang, ok!","P´Castle, GERMANY","Beerhunter111"
2630,"2014-05-29",3.1,"Can from local Yamaya store. Light sourish citrus nose, a modicum of very light banana notes, no spice. Hazy medium straw. Light banana, yeast, bit of citrus, creamy light wheaty finish. Medium body. Not too bad. Very drinkable.","Hirakata, JAPAN","maekchu"
2630,"2014-05-12",2.7,"Can from Yamaya. Spicy, estert nose with a touch of garbage. Medium body, pretty high carbonation. Flavours not bad- mildly creamy wheat, hint of banana. More sweet than sour for me. Not awful.","Kyoto, JAPAN","Westkyoto77"
2630,"2014-04-03",2.9,"Can from Yamaya. Very pale gold with small whi head that doesnt last. Aroma has spices, cloves and wheat. Light flavour, not enough banana for a weizen for me.","Kyoto, JAPAN","GenkiGonzo"
2630,"2014-03-22",2.7,"Can at Hotel Vintage Shinjuku. Clear yellow - white head. Banana, wheaty, cloves, light light orange, sweetness, lots of yeast, light bitterness.....","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Theis"
2630,"2013-07-14",3.2,"5% 280 yen from Yamaya drunk straight from the can during Gion Matsuri in Kyoto. It has a sweet estery spicy aroma with some ale malt notes but an mostly a clove spiciness. I think it is more of a wheat ale than a weizen in terms of the flavor profile but I loved the clove & herbal spicy notes (which is what I prefer in a weizen over banana). Pretty darn good.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
2630,"2013-03-15",1.4,"330ml can bought at CitySuper in Harbour City, Tsim Sha Tsui. Clear pale golden colour; Very thin head and white foam which last for about 1 minute; Minimal lacing and fizzy carbonation; Potent smell of ester, cloves, spices and hint of burnt rubber. No customary banana or vanilla is detected; Light tart taste of clove, with strong spices, citrus, light grass, and hint of phenol; Light body, thin palate with light malt and spices wrapped up tightly in a strong phenolic background all the way, with tartness being well presented; Hoppiness barely detectable with hint of astringency as semi-finish; Pretty dry after taste, quite easy to mouth but the lingering phenol taste is somewhat troublesome.

Comments: being a Kristallweiss, this one has more downs than ups: flat-looking head and lacing, castrated aroma (no banana and vanilla, my favourites), strong and troubling smell and taste of phenolic elements, which is quite troublesome to my tasting pleasure. In short, a disappointment, and I dont think Ill have it again.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"
2630,"2013-01-11",3.6,"(Can) Cloudy yellow with big white head. Aroma is fairly subtle but the dominant notes are spcice and ester. Lovely velvety mouthfeel from fine carbonation. Flavour has lemon tartness, light malt sweetness, hints if banana and spice. Overall a very pleasant and refreshing beer.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Pyobon"
2630,"2012-09-12",3.2,"Can at home bought from tokyu food show. Very pale blonde colour, very translucent, small white head that fades quickly. Aroma is cereal, bit of cream, little hint of spice. Taste is pretty easy going, touch of lemon, hint of banana, bit of wheat and cream, everything you might expect but not so prominent. Very easy to drink and perfectly pleasant but not much more than that.","Tokyo, JAPAN","shoulderbroken"
2630,"2012-06-17",2.9,"A soft, just there weiss. As with any Echigo beer youre never really challenged in any way. Its easy drinking, but uneventful. Light banana and clovey yeast with a short finish. A tad thin compared to a good example of this style.","JAPAN","jonno"
2630,"2011-10-14",3.2,"(Japans first micro brewery, craft beer the world) etc. Looks: sky blue can. Place: bus. Authentic waft of clove, banana chews, slight floured rubber about the nose. A little bit papery maybe but otherwise exactly the kind of clove-peppered, lemon puff and banana-accented refresher I was hoping for. Bit thin and scratchy, some light earthiness there. Pretty decent, but then Im a sucker for a weizen.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"
2630,"2010-05-31",2.7,"Draught at their brewpub. Pale yellow color. Banana and clove aroma; slightly sour. Thin flavor is light and grainy, almost watery. Not too special.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
2630,"2006-11-18",3.5,"Tap at Kimuraya, Sanjo, Niigata, Japan. Cloudy & golden. Sweet citrussy aroma-didnt quite get the cloves.  Clean, bittersweet wheaty flavours. Clean & well-brewed equals Echigo Beer.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","bluekuma"
2630,"2005-10-07",3.4,"Mildly cloudy golden color. Lemony nose with a touch of clove. Light wheaty mouth with lemon and cloves and a refreshing dry finish. Like alot of their beers. Good, but not great.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
