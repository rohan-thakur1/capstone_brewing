3216,"2017-05-19",3.2,"Can. Pours a ark gold body with a one finger fizzy white head. The nose is light coffee with caramel and toasty malt. The flavor is a bit thin with just a light coffee undertone over a slightly sweet pale and caramel maltiness. Lighter bodied with fine fizzy carbonation. Decent enough drinker.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
3216,"2017-04-07",3.4,"UPDATED: APR 7, 2017 12 oz can at the ASMF.Pours slightly hazy with a very good off-white head. Lingering mild coffee flavors. Coffee, biscuits and hops in the nose. Very mild bitterness.  Good balance and mix of hop, malt and coffee flavors.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
3216,"2017-03-18",3.6,"Can. Pours clear golden with a thick and rather persistent ivory head. Quality coffee with a pinch of cocoa dominates the aroma, but lets some fresh malt peep through. Flavor presents tasty coffee as the main player, while fresh malt and a hint of cocoa provide the background. Mouthfeel offers firm body, a little firmer than I recall for most lagers of this type, with spirited fizz and a coffee finish. Cool beans!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
3216,"2017-03-17",3.1,"Pours a slightly cloudy gold color with a finger of bubbly white head. Aroma is smoky mocha with some hot pepper character. Flavor instills similar java notes and a little more of the pepper taste. Finishes a little flat.

3216,"2016-12-30",2.7,"Mostly coffee on top of a strong apple lager yeastiness. Not bad but certainly an acquired taste, one Im not yet sold on. Slack carbonation leaves a bready tartness clinging to the palate, with esters dominating the finish. Interesting but not altogether pleasant.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"
3216,"2016-12-15",2.9,"Draft at Craft and Draft. Clear yellow color. Aroma of coffe and white pepper. Earthy taste.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
3216,"2016-12-14",2.8,"Best By Mar 16 2017.

Appearance: Pours a light coppery body hazed with a fine dusting of particles. Slim, white head.

Smell: It all sort of culminates into a cooked green bell pepper aroma.

Taste: Sugar sweetened, lightly bready malts with coffee (still very, very heavy on the green pepper, vegetal tone). Sweetish finish. Couldnt get too far into this one.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Not workin for me, guys.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
3216,"2016-12-06",3.6,"Really solid coffee lager. Was a little worried but the lager almost had a cream ale taste from the coffee. Nicely balanced and drinkable,","Georgia, USA","rdixon77"
3216,"2016-11-28",3.6,"11/22/16. First 12oz can on the 22nd, and several more days after. Good stuff! Amber-ish pour with a nice khaki head. Nice coffee aroma, works surprisingly well in the base beer. Smooth flavor, nice pale maltiness, creamy coffee aspect. Tasty!","Georgia, USA","drowland"
3216,"2016-11-01",3.4,"Pours a classic golden with a quickly fading antique white head. Coffee beans on the nose. A grainy sweetness is noted as well. I wasnt sure how this was going to work, but things work well. Well-blended flavors with coffee being dominant. Competing sweetness, acidity, and bitterness. Heavy, oily mouthfeel for the style.","Pensacola, Florida, USA","DocJitsu"
