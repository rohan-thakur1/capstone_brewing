Illata aszalt gyümis, malátás, picit élesztős, meglepően komlós és kissé citrusos, akárcsak az íze. Közepesen testes és igen szénsavas. Utóíze keserédes, és kissé száraz, de gyümölcsös. Nagyon jó és a városban kapható testvéreivel ellentétben, ez nem butul el, amikor felmelegszik. Finom.","Budapest, HUNGARY","ogreface"

1869,"2012-06-12",3.9,"Had at Klosterbräu, the waitress said it was from a bottle but produced only the full glass, so well just take her at her word.  Coppery orange body with a soapy white head.  Beautiful malty nose, just super depth of caramel here!  Taste is bitter with a toffee-caramel sledgehammer; with light yeast and faint fruit, there are some distinct English ale notes here, specifically Old Ale treacle mixed with a splash of Bitter.  Dry and bitter taste, sticky full body.  Wow, what a surprise!  Was one of the two or three best beers from my last trip to Bamberg.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

Light golden color; big head. Strong malt aroma, slightly sweet. Malty, strong bock taste, but with a lot of hoppy bitterness. Very interestingly balanced for a hell bock. Wow! Super hoppy, almost overly hopped! It is a refreshing change from the slightly too sweet Austrian heller bocks Ive tried. This might be the best hell bock Ive  tried.

1869,"2006-09-05",3.6,"Clear gold with good, white head, fed by lively carbonation, leaving some lace. Bready, even fresh, wet dough; further some blossomy aromas like muguet. But the dough wins out. Dry, bready taste, the typical Bock (parsley flavoured) character, but finally without all the superfluous sweetness. Some greenery, near grassy in the finish. In fact, I think all sweetness still traceable is from the alcohol. Medium bodied. Alcohol obvious. No new aftertaste, but the (mild) grassiness goes on for a long time. Very good Bock. Uncharacteristic, but all the better for it.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

Not very intense but aromatic sweet malty aroma with honey and herbal, resiny hops. Sweet flavour, medium body and smooth carbonation. Initially sweet malty, slightly fruity taste with honey; sweet and soft malty, later light-bitter finish with a touch of herbal hops.

1869,"2006-05-23",3.6,"UPDATED: AUG 2, 2011 Impressions from the Gaststätte:
-Ample foam protects the clean bronze/golden.
-At first, honey and alcohol is prominent in the nose, not unlike the Czech světlé speciální sub-style.
-Straw and wooden hops soon attempt to balance out the sleek aroma.
-Flavorwise, a haystack stands guard and keeps the alcohol and sweetness in check.
-The frothy carbonation lightens the deal, but the body is pretty lean anyway.
-A healthy peppery, herbal hoppiness builds in the back, fitting with the hay.
-Schwelmers Maibock is more successful in hiding the alcohol while bringing in the same flavor profile, imho.

On tap at the brewery, and also from a bottle bought at the brewery.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
1869,"2006-05-04",3.9,"Bottle. Pours a light golden straw body with a small white head. Strong cereal and bread aroma, cookies, and grass. Interesting flavour - some sweetness and you can certainly taste the alcohol warmth in the middle. Cookies and grainy notes along with a fairly sharp bitter element. Very good.

1869,"2006-05-03",4.2,"Thanks for sharing this rare treat Derek! Sparkling gold pour with heavy white froth and minute lace. Very pleasing grassy component in the nose. Nice mild citrus, hay with lots of noble hopping and mildly malted. Very grassy upon tasting, lots of bittering hops, and a truck full of lemons. Taste finishes mildly acidic. Medium bodied and semi-dry. This is great. ABV not noticable at all. This beer is a PRIME example of a Maibock, excellent in all areas. Why this is simply styled as a ""bock"" here is beyond me. Maibock should have its own style.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"

A wonderful beer that must be enormously hopped to come out so bitter. The aroma is exactly the same as the smell that used to waft over my hometown when they were boiling in the Holes brewery. The second best (after Mahr´s) pale bock I´ve tasted.","Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","rpattinson"
