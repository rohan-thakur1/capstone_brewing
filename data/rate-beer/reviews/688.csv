688,"2016-05-12",4.2,"Bottle: Poured a dark copper color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention. Aroma of nice vanilla and bourbon notes with some caramelized malt and nice toffee notes. Taste is a mix of deep caramelized malt with some nice toffee undertones which are well-balanced against some vanilla and bourbon notes. Body is full with good carbonation and light warming alcohol notes. The beer is very well balanced which still showcasing some extreme flavours.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
688,"2016-01-10",4.3,"January 9. 2016 - bottle from Brett. Brown pour with limited head. Aroma was bourbon, wood, caramel and dark fruit. Taste was consistent with aroma, but heavier on the bourbon and wood. 2013 vintage.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
688,"2015-01-26",4.8,"Bottle... This beer rocks! Pours clear and dark brown with a small, fleeting, mushroom-colored head. The aroma is fantastic. It has all the plush notes of vanilla, caramel, milk chocolate and espresso of the base beer, but also offers subtle notes of bourbon and toasted oak. Full-bodied with a slick, creamy mouthfeel and a touch more carbonation than the base beer. The luxuriant flavor is an intermingling of caramel, mocha, toasted coconut, vanilla and brownie brittle. Lightly warming bourbon, toasted tree nuts and toffee in the finish. Not at all boozy. Better than Alesmith BBA Wee Heavy. Another world class beer brewed by the fine folks at Pipeworks and shipped my way by BBB63!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
688,"2014-12-17",2.8,"Appearance is black with brown around the edges. No head. Nose is oak (massive oak), alcohol and molasses. Taste is of vanilla, alcohol, oak, caramel, light chocolate sweetness up front, and a dry finish. No carbonation. I feel it spent too much time on the oak.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","GlassBrass440"
688,"2014-12-16",2.9,"Bottle. Nose is caramel with some sugar and booze. Light vanilla. Strong cherry and apple flavors initially with a very light and plain finish. Hardly any mouthfeel. Mediocre really. Lacks mouthfeel and chewiness.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"

688,"2014-06-27",3.5,"Sampled at a STL tasting - Pours mahogany brown with no head. The aroma has cocoa, vanilla, toffee, some bourbon and an overall richness. It has a full rich body with light sharp carbonation. The aroma has toffee, smooth scotch ale malt, cocoa, alcohol and caramel. The finish is heavy on the vanilla and alcohol warmth. Good for the style.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
688,"2014-05-22",4.0,"Bottle. Pour is murky dark brown with a thin ring of tan bubbles. Aroma is big with lots of burnt caramel, alcohol, wafer cookies, milk chocolate, and vanilla. Big, but nice. Flavor is true to nose with lots of rich, dark caramel, light alcohol, and a smooth vanilla finish. Sweet, but not too sweet with a wonderful smooth, rich finish. I was not sure what to expect from this beer, but it is really good.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"

688,"2014-04-08",3.6,"Batch #90.
Appearance: The pour is murky with a chestnut hue and inside the glass the beer appears a completely opaque deep chestnut with light showing through the edges. A very short and short lived light tan head forms a small coating, but quickly retreats into the body.
Aroma: Brown sugar, oak and bourbon initially greet my nose with slightly smokey aromas and a dried dark fruits presence. Theres a sort of coca cola like aroma as it warms up a bit, though the other aromas are noted.
Taste: The intro has a coca cola vibe with a slight sweetness. Vanilla kicks in strong by the mid-taste with a big caramel, dried dark fruits, and brown sugar. The finish kicks in a hint of coconut, with brown sugar, a touch of bourbon lingers and a taste of flat coca cola, finishing sweet.
Palate: Medium bodied, mildly carbonated.
Overall: I enjoy the flavors going on, but I keep getting the vibe that I am drinking flat coca cola. I certainly am going to struggle even drinking the 12 ounce bottle. This could have easily been split with 2-3 people. Its good and Im glad to have tried it, but its not my favorite.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"
688,"2014-03-30",4.2,"Bottle thanks to csteel2144! Pours cloudy deep mahogany black, small creamy brown head that dissipates leaving nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is bourbon, vanilla, oak, dark sugars. Flavor is much the same, boozy and sweet, vanilla and bourbon, dark cherries, a bit HoTD-like actually. Minimal bitterness or astringency. Quite smooth and drinkable, if a little hot. Medium body, decent mouthfeel. If I were to knock it, it is perhaps too much on the bourbon side, with the scotch ale characteristics fading away. Nice effort though!","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"

688,"2014-03-06",4.0,"Bottle thanks to John. Pours a dark brown with beige head. The aroma is strong peat, smoke, and roast. Medium mouthfeel with light scotch oak and nice boozy smokiness in finish. Very impressive.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
688,"2014-03-01",2.9,"Bottle - Cola-colored with an off-white head. Nose is sweet molasses, whiskey--real smooth--and a dark malt base. Taste is hot and sharp, with lots of sugary sweetness. Slick and medium-bodied. Lowish carbonation. Just too much heat in the taste for me.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
688,"2014-02-09",3.9,"Bottle (12 oz). Thanks to Rich for this one! Dark brown with a small beige head and little lacing. Theres a lot of bourbon in the aroma long caramel/toffee, vanilla, wood, alcohol, light spiciness and plums (dark fruits). Taste is moderately sweet and dominated by bourbon along toffee/caramel, dark fruits, spices, vanilla, alcohol and wood. Warming finish. Medium/full bodied. Medium carbonation (small bubbles). Hot/boozy finish. Quite complex. Balanced isnt the best feature of the beer because of the huge amount of bourbon, but its not overwhelming/cloying either. Tasty and well done!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
688,"2014-01-15",4.4,"12 oz bottle. Dark brown pour with a thin swirl of small bubbles. Holy sweet bourbon. Lots of brown sugar Carmel and tasty bourbon. Just the right amount of bourbon. Palate is a bit on the thin side, but not too annoying I guess where it should be for a scotch ale but also pretty creamy.  Better backwoods or the like. Amazing stuff.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
688,"2013-12-29",4.0,"12 ounce bottle and served in my new big arse thistle: Pours a nice muddy deep brown with a small but lasting head, some oily tears. The taste and nose has lots of bourbony character of oak, vanilla, char and booze. Still a fair amount of the caramel toffee, special roast and plummy dark fruit from the base beer too. The mouth feel is dryish and biting, sticky and very warming. Yeah it is a tad hot but should take to aging very well. I like this ever so slightly better than the base Wee Heavy. The aroma is incredible but then that could be the product of the glassware choice.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
688,"2013-11-19",3.4,"Sampled at FoBAB2013. Pours a rich dark brown with a tan head. Aroma of bourbon, barrel, mild toffee and caramel sweetness. Some burnt sugar. Soft vanilla and peated notes, mile smokiness. Flavor is smokey, with strong bourbon and sugary malt notes. Spicy, meatiness, umami notes. Some salt, pepper. An interesting tapestry of flavors. Slick bodied, some booze towards the finish. Solid entry.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
688,"2013-11-18",3.8,"On tap at FoBAB 2013 (Chicago, IL). Pours a deep dark brownish near opaque pour. Dark and ominous, some faint ruby brown glow on the edges. A big cakey tannish head atop stays as a firm big layer, sticks around, laces well. Aromas are a touch of peated malt, caramel and toffee. Some toast, whiskey and vanilla. Gentle dark and dried fruit. A bit tannic but still a firm body remains to hold up. Some firmer carmelized sweetness. Initial is firmer bodied, throwing whiskey, firm barrel presence overall than the nose let on. Buffalo trace, spice and heat meet vanilla, gentle sweetness. Toffee, toast, a bit deadened. Some mellow dark and red fruit remains. Backend is a bit toasty, carmelized, and mellow sweetness. Vanilla hangs on, some toast, toffee. Touches of peated toasted malt. Somesweetness, the barrel is firmerm finish is toasty, carmelized, some decent heat and linger barrel. Nice stuff. Much preferred to the base with some added development, thicker sweet sticky base cleared up a bit/able to support the barrel","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
