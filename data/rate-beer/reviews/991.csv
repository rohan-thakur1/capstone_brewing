991,"2016-12-29",3.9,"Bottle in Winter Park with jcnielsen. Thanks Adam. Pours a hazy yellow appearance with an off white head. Strangely enough, this smells like noble hops and champagne. Theres funk, grass, and oak as well. Moderate plus carbonation. A little twangy. Surprisingly, this really displays the herbal hops well. Pretty good and not what I was expecting. Kinda like Allagash House Beer.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
991,"2016-11-26",3.9,"Shared bottle to balloons. Left the sediments behind so its a nice golden yellow with an everlasting white head. Ill drink those sediments later. My horrible allergies have my palate off a bit but its heavy on the typical brett characteristics. Lemony citrus. Bready malt. Slight funk. Biting carbonation.","Erin, Wisconsin, USA","demmbonz"

991,"2016-06-08",4.3,"500mL from the brewery store in New Glarus, WI. Hazed gold pour with thick meringue foam. Beautiful Brett nose, fresh citrus, thyme, flowers. Taste is bubbly up front, dry mid palate, mild citrus peel, little to no acid. Pretty much a super simple Brett saison. Nothing crazy, pretty straighforward. Base malt character is crackery and sharp. Hop balance is lightly herbal and grassy. Palate is exquisite: buoyant and refreshing. Its nuanced but delicious.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

The flavor starts with mild cotton candy with a touch of Belgian yeast. The finish has mild florals, citrus peel, grass, and straw.

991,"2016-02-11",3.9,"500ml bottle acquired via trade on a Facebook Chicago Group. Thanks, bro. Pours a hazy golden amber hue, decent hazy darker middle shows some fall golden glow onto the edges. A sizable large crown of offwhite bubbly head atop sticks around loud and proud, good lacing and retaining in that capacity. Aromas are fruity and funky, distinct white pepper, cobwebs and horseblanket compliment apple and pear, subtle banana fruity appeal. Bready malts, a kiss of honeycrisp with dust, dry straw and subtle cereal grains. A Belgian appeal comes on, funky and spicy, that estery fruit turns just a faint bit tart due to the pineapple. An enjoyable expression as the brett actually becomes the pace setter as it settles more, the more potent fruit elements tapering off from the fresh pour. Initial is lighter bodied with still a touch of girthiness to remind you, a firmer brett take is dusty and dry, cobwebs and horseblanket come to roost with some spiciness, subtle yeasty appeal and an initial pop of estery apple and pear that die off quickly, gentle fruit, subtle bubblegum press a bit. Dry, lighter as we press on with distinct bretty life. Dry, a touch bitter with dust and funk pressing the issue through subtle sweetness. The body cleans up, dry and light with a distinct bretty life, fuzzy and spicy, with nice lingering fruit, subtle secondary sweetness. A funk profile that works for me personally, dry and dusty with some spiciness that develops into the back. A body that seeed a bit sweet at first but really cleans up through the experience. Dry, a touch of tart pineapple, funky lingering elements and subtle earthy dry straw appeal. Fun stuff, a solid drinker. Impressive pour, more fruity nose (though still bretty), the beer itself expresses the bretty life much more, a bit taken over but drinking very nice right now. Tasty stuff. Im surprised on some of the low scores here..","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

991,"2015-11-27",3.7,"Bottle - Pours orangish-gold with a foamy off-white head. Nose is plastic, a little orange and lemon citrus hops, and a dry yeastiness.

991,"2015-11-09",4.0,"500ml bottle, thanks to phaleslu for sharing. 	Almost entirely hazy golden orange color. Thin white head. Awesome big wild funky character up front. Get some nice big citrusy/peppery hop again, much more so than your typical belgian ale. Great kind of mild funky belgian yeast, too though. Nice moderate to bigger bitter taste, moderate sweet. Light dry finish. Very mild wild brett-type funk, but not sour. Medium-plus body. Smooth, kind of soft, lighter carbonation. Fantastic golden ale. Another that Id have happily chiefed on my own.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
