51,"2017-06-08",4.3,"On nitro tap at Library Alehouse in Venice, CA a few weeks back. Gosh...or gaaaaleee...while Id dont drink coffee, I surely would if it tasted like this! Gold with head and lace, aroma of coffee and beer, modest mouthfeel but what an amazing flavor profile. Granted a bit sweet, but this is an amazing sensation on the tongue with malts, grains, hops, cold coffee and sugar. Yum...I could probably do a keg of this beauty, especially on nitro!","LA, California, USA","DenverLogan"
51,"2017-05-02",3.8,"(Tap) clear, bright golden colour with a medium tall white head; creamy palate; aroma of roast, coffee; mostly sweet flavour with a long, light bitter sweet finish",", Ontario, CANADA","thorongil2"
51,"2017-05-01",4.1,"Tap at Bear Republic. What is with the golden color for a milk stout? What the what? Golden with white head. Coffee dominates aroma. Creamy, burnt coffee flavor. Im a bit confused with what is going on here with the color.","Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, USA","BiddleBrau"
51,"2017-02-12",3.8,"On draft at Aces and Ales. Coffee with slight green pepper, chocolate, creamy head. This is exactly what I was expecting, executed very well.","Bountiful, Utah, USA","Gription79"
51,"2017-01-01",3.5,"On nitro tap at Apex, pours a hazy golden with a creamy white head. Aroma brings out dry earthy espresso beans and toasted biscuity malt. Flavour is dominated by the coffee beans upfront, followed by fairly prominent lactose and a little cocoa. Finishes medium sweet, with notes of vanilla and espresso. Very nice but seemingly overrated to me.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
51,"2016-06-13",3.8,"Nitro pour. Pours orange with a white head. Rich sweet cold brew, sweet mocha and cream, and a mild roasted coffee finish. Damn good.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
51,"2016-02-27",3.7,"Draft - Big roasty coffee notes. Clearish gold with a rich white head. Coffee, sweet and rich notes with a big body.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
51,"2016-01-11",4.1,"Tap. Pours hazy orange, large creamy beige head, long lasting with nice lacing. Aroma is huge coffee. Flavor is latte, lots of milk sugar and huge cold press coffee. Light plus sweet, medium bitter, mostly from the roast. Rich and creamy. If coffee was a beer, this would be it. Wow. Medium plus body, ultra creamy mouthfeel. Winner.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
51,"2015-11-23",4.0,"Tap at brewery. Pours golden with white head. Aroma is very coffee, sweet, a bit of hop coming through. Taste is creamy, rich coffee, med bodied, easy, drinkable and very good. Overall, highly recommend.","Colorado, USA","Danyel"
51,"2015-11-14",4.0,"tap - golden stout smells of coffee above all else, with some roasted malt and light chocolate. Some vanilla in addition to the rest in the flavor. Silky. Good stuff.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
51,"2015-09-29",3.8,"VERY VERY VERY GOLDEN STOUT. MUCH COFFEE. VANILLA. SWEET. GOOD BEER BUT I AM NOT DYING TO DRINK MORE.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
51,"2015-09-10",3.9,"Taste at beer belly. ""golden milk stout"". Pours pale straw, massive coffee flavour and aroma, mildly sweet. Curious how it gets the coffee presumably using no roast malt (or it would be dark). Very nice but I didnt think I could face a full glass!","Los Angeles, California, USA","RafeAU"
51,"2015-06-11",4.3,"Crazy beer with spiciest some peppery tones wand coffee. Earthy herbal hops. Fairly full palet and good crisp finish.","Palm desert, California, USA","Ratpatrol1019"
51,"2015-05-31",4.8,"OH FUCK YES. Ok, so this is the gold standard for ""golden stouts"". The coffee and the creaminess in this beer, the sheer increadibly perfect roasted notes. I could drink this for DAYS.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
51,"2015-05-28",3.9,"Des céréales enrobées de miel, une montée de lactose et un coup de grâce torréfié. Le service au nitro fait du sens mais en pratique ça accentue leffet du lactose qui navait pas besoin daide.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
51,"2015-05-09",4.2,"On tap at the source. Pours a clear golden with a creamy white head. Wow. Super smooth. Surprising flavor. Slightly sweet milk coffee. Really interesting. Wow.

51,"2015-03-20",3.8,"Draft at Barrel Republic. Pours clear copper with a smooth creamy white head. Tastes like iced coffee, a hint of chocolate, roasted malt, and light creaminess. Light body and low carbonation. Smells like roasted coffee beans, roasted malt, and fresh brewed coffee.","baltimore, Maryland, USA","snoworsummer"
51,"2015-03-16",3.4,"[2/18/15] Draught at Noble Ale Works in Anaheim. Clear deep golden. Nice strong coffee aroma. Sweetish flavor with lactose, coffee, a chocolate hint and a bit of malt. Medium-bodied, nitro mouthfeel. A nice coffee beer.","Tel Aviv, ISRAEL","DSG"
51,"2015-02-21",4.0,"Pour on tap at Oaks Tavern, hazy golden pour with white head, nitro pour, aroma brought notes of big espresso, coffee bean, latte type note with a hint of vanilla, honey, slight bready note as well in there. Taste was a mix of espresso, green coffee beans, some vanilla into honey, biscuit, slight yeasty, finishing fairly bitter, slightly sweet. Very tasty!","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
51,"2014-11-08",3.9,"Clear gold with a two-finger dense white head that dissipates slowly and leaves very nice lace. Strong creamy coffee aromas with roasted malts and a touch of chocolate. Taste is similar, with a strong yet delicate coffee and lactose sweetness. Medium body and carbonation, creamy smooth mouthfeel, light carbonation and a soft finish. Very reminiscent of really good coffee ice cream.","Pacific Palisades, California, USA","RedSox2004"
51,"2014-10-11",3.5,"Hipster OC. Totally Awks. Not in a fin way but pretty good. Strange hops, strange roast, and a cedar note. Abundance of flavor but couldnt pound a bunch. Just enjoy the one.","Los Angeles, California, USA","Hipsterchick"
51,"2014-10-07",4.5,"Poured at GABF...crazy brew...strated to like this cross between a pale ale and stouty vegatable. But as I kept drinking it it grew on me so much, I couldnt get enough. You just gotta try it. But take my wourd for it after so many beers we had at the GABFs you wont be disapointed.","Denver, USA","Broncosnbeer101"
51,"2014-08-03",3.7,"On nitro at the Faction Ales for ALS festival. I was pretty excited to see this one here. It pours a golden orange color with a creamy white head. The aroma is straight up potent freshly ground coffee beans, honey and bread. Sweet lactose. It kind of has a milkshake quality to it honestly. The flavor is the same with coffee, milk sugars, honey and milkshake in the finish. A very sweet beer, but the lactose and coffee were balanced very nicely. Interesting stuff.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
51,"2014-07-20",3.9,"Nitro at Noble. Pours golden. Huge coffee nose. Taste is largely coffee as well. Unlike any stout -- or any beer, really -- Ive ever had. Very fun to sample.","Valley Village, California, USA","Ontape"
51,"2014-07-04",3.9,"Tap at Library Alehouse, awesome golden pour, white head, nose is coffee, taste is coffee, creamy and delicious!","Santa Monica, California, USA","DedicatedToFun"
51,"2014-05-27",3.9,"P: Golden with a very thick white head. S: Coffee, oatmeal and just a bit of roast. T: Coffee, oats and some wheat. M: Creamy, light and soft. O: Pretty simple beer, not really much going on but it is very good and original.","South Gate, California, USA","toxichop"
51,"2014-05-16",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2014 Pours a clear copper color thick creamy head and great lacing rings. Aroma is sweet roasted coffee and peanut butter cups. Taste follows the aroma with a medium to thick mouth feel. Epic desert beer.","orange, California, USA","badpuppy69"
51,"2014-03-03",3.7,"Draft at the brewpub. Pours orange-gold with a modest, white foam head. Pretty nice stuff but the coffee character is really aggressive. Big coffee in the aroma followed by even bigger coffee presence in the flavor. Also notes of sweet bread and dried berries. Medium bodied with fine to average carbonation. Strong, pungent coffee finish. Somewhat one-dimensional but quite nice if you enjoy your coffee dark and strong.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
51,"2014-02-27",3.9,"Nitro at Blind Lady Ale House, side by side with the Bean Bump. Clear medium yellow amber, whitish Nitro head. Big coffee aroma, though less after Id smelled bean bump. Also smells a little sweet with vanilla and lactose, but again, way less after drinking the Bean Bump. Flavor has plenty of coffee, no burnt or acidic notes. A little sweet, but after a couple sips of the Bump, seems rather tasteless and watery. Light body with low carbonation. Actually very tasty and sessionable, albeit its mainly a big coffee bomb. I am OK with this. The Bean Bump is just so much more intense with fruity coffee berry notes it makes this one a little less badass. I think Id like a halfway point between the two. More coffee complexity in the lower alcohol beer to, well, make it more complex.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
51,"2014-02-07",4.4,"What the fuck am I drinking!!!-??!-! Draft at Beechwood BBQ Lobg Beach. Looks like an IPA - clear amber pour with a thick white head. Nose is coffee and slightly malty. Mouthfeel is really thick despite it being such a simple looking beer. Wow taste coffee malty and slightly sweet. I dont understand. Coffee only goes into dark beers???!!!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
51,"2014-01-27",3.9,"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a nice head. Aroma has coffee all the way with some mild nuttiness. Taste has a smooth coffee flavor. It also has some vanilla and roasted malt flavor. Unique taste considering the appearance. Good finish.","Orange County, California, USA","ADfan"
51,"2014-01-22",5.0,"A top notch beer from start to finish, this is perhaps the best milk stout out there today (and I have tasted Udder Love).

51,"2013-08-27",4.0,"Pours a hazy orange, nothing I would imagine for a stout. Coffee aromas right of the bat. The drink is amazing with a creamy, silky taste on the palate and sweet coffee flavors throughout the drink. A must!","Pico Rivera, California, USA","Jcarb28"
51,"2013-08-25",4.2,"pours hazy gold. Huge coffee on the nose. Think new spent coffee. Thick and creamy on the palate, with perfect notes of coffee. So freaking good. Not quite a stout by definition, but it doesnt matter.","California, USA","Peacehammer"
51,"2013-08-18",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 8, 2014 Pours a cloudy yellow color with a strong coffee and cigar aroma. The appearance of this beer does not match the flavor and aroma. Taste is complex, with coffee, roasted hops, and caramel mixed with a light drinkability. A hint of creaminess throughout the beer which I equate to milk being in this beer. This beer tastes more like a stout than any other style, I really enjoyed it and would divulge again.","Diamond Bar, California, USA","Barreras"
51,"2013-08-14",4.2,"On draft on the brewery. Pours a hazy, light golden mandarin orange. Intense coffee nose with a boatload of pungent roastiness and an earthy-tobacco spice blend. Awesome taste of light-roasted coffee (much less than the nose), a touch of caramel, a sweet, slightly creamy middle, and a very malty finish. Total mindfreak; close your eyes and drink it and youll swear its a normal, sweet coffee stout. Great brew.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
51,"2013-08-12",3.9,"Tap at 38 Degrees for The Full Pint 6th Anniversary. Panama version. Pours clear orange with nitro white foam. Sheets of nitro foam. Nose is rich coffee, hilarious for SRM, pretty much smells like walking into a sidewalk coffee shop. Taste is really nice- caramel frappacino comes to mind, vanilla latte, rich. I dont usually like coffee beers, but this one really was delicious.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
51,"2013-05-01",4.2,"Draft at Hollingshead. Pours a clear, dark golden color with a thick, frothy, white head. Strong aroma of coffee and chocolate. Very smooth taste with coffee and a chocolate finish. Unique gold stout, but one of the more impressive beers I have ever had!","Newport Beach, California, USA","haddon90"
51,"2013-04-13",4.0,"13 apr 2013, nitro tap at Noble Ale Works. Dark gold. Nose is HUGE espresso. Med, creamy body, mildly fizzy. Delicious espresso with milk, some bitter coffee bean finish. Lovely!

51,"2013-02-25",3.9,"Tap at Noble. Pours a clear deep golden color with creamy white. Totally odd for the aroma and taste. Very unique. Aroma is coffee forward, fresh grounds, earth, slight sweetness and some light chocolate. Taste is very creamy with again loads of unique coffee going on here. If I were into coffee I can see this being even more appealing.","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"
51,"2013-02-13",4.1,"On tap at Slater's 50/50 in San Diego, CA.

Clear bright gold with large off-white head and excellent lacing.  Yes, a golden milk stout. 
 
Aroma of chocolate, coffee and caramel.

Taste of chocolate, coffee and caramel.

Medium/full body and soft carbonation.

51,"2013-02-02",4.3,"This is my early favorite for best beer if 2013. A swirling combination of sweet, coffee and creaminess. It is a strong coffee aroma but the taste is balanced with the three other components very well. Almost like a coffee and cream popsicle. One of those special beers whose aroma is so great you dont want to drink it but you have to because it tastes do good.","Glendale, California, USA","beersearcher"
51,"2013-01-27",3.9,"Hazy golden pour with a dense white head. Intense coffee around and a nice sweetness. Bread, a surprising roast character, and a nice lactose note. The flavor has a very intense coffee flavor. A bit earthy, a bit spicy, and a bit chocolatey. Good lactose and malt sweetness, a bit of toffee, and some of the same roast notes. Very nicely done.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
51,"2012-12-22",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 15, 2013 On tap at PlaygroundDTSA (their first anniversary beer: Dons Naughty Sauce). Pours with a hazed brown hued body with a creamy tan head. The aroma is absolutely insane. Massive brown sugar, toasted nuts, coffee, light tobacco and some very nice bready malt character. Very complex coffee, some lactose character. Stunning. Flavors are bready with brown sugar notes, shortbread, and an intense and vibrant coffee character. Light roasted notes. Creamy, medium to fuller body, velvety. Awesome!","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
