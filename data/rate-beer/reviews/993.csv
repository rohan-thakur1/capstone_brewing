993,"2015-10-24",4.4,"This really is a fantastic beer. I poured it carefully and got a nice hazy lemon-yellow IPA. In my opinion this is not a classic saison, but more of a fusion beer. It is essentially a single-hop IPA with Belgian yeast. The yanks have mastered this style and this compares very favourably. 
Take a big whiff to start and youÂ’ll get some tart lemon and grapefruit and a nice floral component. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, which is just what IÂ’m looking for, and the citrus flavours almost make you screw your face theyÂ’re so real and tarte; mixing with the Belgian yeat you get a little earty spiciness. The bitterness is clean and the finish long - as soon as one giant gulp of this great grog goes down, you just want another.

A medium citric sourness dominates the taste buds over a light, biscuity sweetness. Light bodied, with a delicate, silky texture and medium-low carbonation. ThereÂ’s a slightly boozy, warming finish.
