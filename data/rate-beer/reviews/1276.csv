1276,"2015-09-15",3.7,"Bottle at home, from Royal Mike Whisky. It pours deep amber with a decent off-white head. The nose is bitter-sweet, juicy, biscuit, toffee, fruit cake and nut. The taste is bitter, piney action, toffee, baked goods, biscuit and some candied peel with a dry finish. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Great balance and high drinkability. Very drinkable.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"

1276,"2015-08-29",3.7,"Bottle from beer 52 pours a great deep Amber minimal lacing and head.

Great job from the folks at Heriot Watt.","SCOTLAND","unstablefable"
1276,"2015-08-27",3.7,"Aroma: caramel, bread malts, lots of grain. Appearance: clear amber, small, creamy, white head. Taste: light sweet. Palate: grain malts, some caramel, light floral hops coming up, remains quite light, but delicate. Overall: very nice ESB, excellent aroma and palate, well-balanced. Pint at Cloisters Bar, Edinburgh.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MrTipple"
1276,"2015-08-22",3.8,"This is a very refreshing example of an Amber ale of American style, perhaps more so than esb. The nose is not particularly distinguished, but it has a very nice palate of Orange and biscuit malt. The finish is gently hoppy. I am quaffing this on a got evening, it hits the spot nicely, so much more sophisticated than your average lager.","","themightylazza"
1276,"2015-08-10",4.2,"A fine example of a hoppy ESB with the American hops adding a citrus zing over the solid malt flavours. Really good ""English"" ale!

Taste is hoppy up front, pine and orange with some biscuity malt. Fully bodied and goes down easy. Id say it has a lot more in common with amber ales listed on this site than bitters.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","BenH"
