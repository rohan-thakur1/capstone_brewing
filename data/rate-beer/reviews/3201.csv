3201,"2017-06-18",3.2,"Draft. Clear pale yellow color white head. Floral aroma. Taste is light straw, light body. OK.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
3201,"2017-05-25",3.7,"Tall boy can. Pours light copper, sudsy head. Nose is caramel malt, baked bread, a little bit of baking spice, oddly enough. Marmalade hops. Full, clean flavor. Hint of citrus, bready. A ding for the color (this is an amber lager, clearly), but really tasty.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","jlruthven"
3201,"2017-03-16",3.3,"UPDATED: MAR 17, 2017 It is what it says it is. A standard lager. Very flavorful for a standard lager and wonderfully malty. Beautiful amber color. Tiny bit of citrus and nicely earthy. Great beer for the money. 16 oz. 4 pack cans for less than $6. Fulton did a great job with this beer. Im going back for more.","Minnesota, USA","tryemallonce"
3201,"2017-02-09",3.6,"Pint can pours a clear amber/orange with a medium khaki head. Aroma of caramel and toffee malts with slight yeast and hops. Taste of light caramel and toffee malts with very dry bitter hops and earthy yeast with some fruitiness on the finish. Solid!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
3201,"2017-01-21",2.9,"Amber color with a small head. Very light ght aroma of grain silo and butter. Flavor is... Present? Whiffs of grain and caramel. Suggestion of corn. Dry. Inoffensive to its core.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
3201,"2017-01-10",2.5,"16 oz. can, consumed on 1-1-17. Cornmeal and corn soup scents. A bit of dryness in the aroma. Clear bronze. Large amount of cream-colored head. A lot of bubbles on the side of the glass. Looks surprisingly good. Dry, corny flavor. Im surprised this is all malt because the flavor is a dead ringer for corn. Popcorn taste. Some dryness. Apple juice and a bit of orange. Somewhere between an American pale lager and a decent European pilsner, like a Becks or a Stella Artois. Bitter finish. Light body. Aqueous in the palate. Not as crisp as a lager should be. Frothy. Not a bad refresher. Better than a typical pale lager, but thats not saying much. A below average craft beer, although I dont think Fulton aspires to craft for this offering.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
3201,"2017-01-06",3.6,"Beer is kind of all over the place. Long lasting smaller head with some lace but a darker than traditional ""standard"" lager. Aroma and flavor stand true to the name. But is not exceptional.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"
3201,"2016-12-25",3.0,"12oz bottle pour is golden with small white head aroma is a bit of grass and malt beer taste was a bit thin but good for the style.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","Ronritter"
3201,"2016-10-27",3.2,"Minnesota Trip Beer #195. Keg at the brewery, 5/12/16. Clear copper, thin creamy off-white head, good retention. Aroma of caramel, toasted malts, floral notes, citrus, apple. The taste is toasted malts, caramel, apples, lemony citrus. Thin-medium bodied.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
3201,"2016-10-13",3.8,"From a can into my beer mug. Light copper in color. Slightly sweet malt. Easy drinker. Not a bad beer with my meatloaf dinner.","Minneapolis, ","Obfuscate"
3201,"2016-10-10",3.1,"Starting my Minnesota Lager challenge (quest for the best). Pours a dull golden/slightly bronze hue with nice off-white head. Considered an all malt beer and agree. Light carbonation, but body's a little too thin. Taste is a little grassy, little malt sweetness, pretty smooth throughout. Not a bad pale lager. Definitely appropriate for a lawn mower, lawn raker beer.
