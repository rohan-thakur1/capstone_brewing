4394,"2016-03-08",3.7,"Bottle from Cotteridge Wines and drunk at home. Black beer, lasting beige head. Aroma of dark fruits like raisins and currants. Touch of hop on the aroma too. I mean its more like a modern hoppy dark lager than a schwarzbier. In fact it tastes like a hoppy stout. I dont know about the lager bit. Very bitter and hoppy on the finish. No idea why this is classed as a premium lager. Mind you I have no idea what style it is. Dark chocolate flavour is good.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

4394,"2015-12-22",3.7,"Bottle. Trembling Madness Drinks Shop, York. Clear, reddy amber. Poured into a Cloudwater glass it has lots of fast rising bubbles, keeping alive a thin, dense, sticky, pale tan head. Nicely fruity, juicy, brûléed grapefruit hop. Some resinous notes. The lager malts allow the hops to shine. Taste is juicy bitter, tempered by a clean malt backdrop. Decent body. Soft and foamy. Gets more juicy and bitter on the finish. Definitely an interesting brew. Id have thought hoppy brown ale. Whatever, this is good stuff. Very drinkable.","Sheffield, South Yorkshire, ENGLAND","Garrold"
