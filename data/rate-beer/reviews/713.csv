Very cloudy with  a thick white head.  Quite sticky.  Aroma is awesome.  Sweet spicy maltiness with a big bright snap of caraway seeds over the nice doughy/wheaty rye aroma.  There is a touch of light citrusy character over the sweet spiciness.  Bready full-body but the acidity helps to cut through that aspect of the beer.  As it warms,a bit of fruitiness comes to the fore as well.

713,"2007-04-30",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Caraway spiciness and fruity originality blooms into the subtle tartness of malt vinegar, as rye develops into an approachable, well-furnished body. A creation sure to bring amazement to those ready for a tastebud-expanding experience.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-The grain character works marvelously with the well-integrated spiciness.
-The low carbonation and lean mouthfeel makes this eccentric number insanely drinkable.
-This liquid sourdough rye bread impersonation is fascinating.
-The finish is spicy and lightly bitter, a fading out of the intelligent experiment which preceded.

From a fresh growler. Thx Paul, Jon & Rich!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

Sampled multiple times at Princeton and brought home a few growlers.  Fantastic stuff, Im definitely raising my score from the previous 3.7 (8-4-7-4-14).  This beer is amazing to smell, it brings a new depth of complexity over any rye beer Ive tried.  Yes, its intensely bready and you cannot help but be confounded by its uncanny resemblance to rye bread.  But how much of that is the power of suggestion?  The body is fuller than I remember, and the alcohol more potent, with the presence of doughy yeast that is this beers glue.  The aromas are beautiful, floral, deep caraway notes, recently cut grains, Montana morning fields.  The fullness of the palate culminates in a lip-smacking stickiness.  Its rad.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
713,"2004-12-23",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 18, 2007 Rye beer. Literally. Slightly hazy, amber body. Smells like a Jewish deli. Strong, intriguing aroma of caraway seeds and rye. Grainy flavor brings more of the same, but more subdued, with a delicate pale malt presence. But spicy rye rules the flavor here. Dangerously drinkable, medium-light body with tons of flavor. Unlike typical rye beers, this truly is rye bread in a glass. After sampling about 2 oz. at GABF 2004, I later nursed a pint at Triumph New Hope in March 2006 followed by a number of later samplings. This beer stood out among hundreds of samples at GABF, and that is a significant thing. Reminds you that beer and bread are intimate cousins.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
713,"2004-10-03",4.2,"GABF2004... Poured a dark golden color with a white head and light lacing on the glass.  Amazing aroma of caraway seed and rye.  Minty rye bread taste, slightly sweet.  My first rye ale, I really like this one!","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
713,"2004-09-16",3.1,"Caraway flavor steals the show for me.    Jewish rye is the exact flavor of this doughy ale.   Unique.","Glenside, Pennsylvania, USA","JFGrind"
713,"2004-09-08",4.2,"New Hope location.  My roommate gets fresh Jewish Rye bread from the farmers market, and this is exactly it, only liquid.  Absolutely delicious.","Nutley, New Jersey, USA","Jine"
713,"2004-07-20",3.5,"Tap @ David Copperfields. This indeed is Rye Bread in a bottle. The best rye beer Ive had. Its an orange like color with a smallish thin head. The aroma has a nice flowery citrus thing going on. The rye isnt over powering but just right. Another winner by Triumph.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
713,"2004-06-28",4.0,"Tap at NJ fest 04. No description necessary. This tastes and smells exactly like a loaf of fresh Jewish Rye bread!","Good Beer Bar Deprived, New Jersey, USA","MaiBockAddict"
713,"2004-06-22",3.6,"Crystal clear, copper ale with a small, creamy, off-white head. Great retention. Thick, creamy lacing. The aroma and flavor are of rye bread including the caraway seeds... definitely used to spice things up. Medium-bodied with a watery mouthfeel and almost no carbonation. Short, astringent finish.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
713,"2004-06-11",4.2,"Tap at David Copperfields Pub, NYC: Utterly fantastic!  Very sweet and loaded with odd rye flavor which rarely comes through in a rye beer because the flavor is so subtle.  A medium bodied, essentially unhopped brew.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
713,"2004-05-22",4.9,"UPDATED: DEC 20, 2005 Had to rerate, just an outstanding beer!

One of my favorites from Triumph.  If you like Rye bread, this will be in your top 10 beers.  
Aroma is like a beer soaked piece of rye bread.  Slight sour malt up front, but then the rye kicks in midway through and continues in the finish.  Perfection in balance between a hint of malt and subtle sourdough flavors. One of those brews you can only understand if you try it.  Awesome brew!!  Make it a point to visit the brewery when this one shows up!","Eastampton, New Jersey, USA","Cornboy"
713,"2004-04-28",3.8,"Had this at the Manayunk event.  I can honestly say that Ive never had a beer quite like this one.  Pours turbid orangish, with aroma of malt, hops, citrus, caramel, and bread.  Tastes slightly tart, sour, malty, with some ginger.  The finish is tart, very smooth, and very crisp.  A very complex and unique beer.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
713,"2002-06-30",4.3,"Never had a rye-style of beer and I dont usually like rye-style bread either, but this was outstanding, the aroma was awesome like it just came out of the oven, dark amber in color, very smooth, you could taste the sourdough in the aftertaste, just like eating a slice of rye bread, very outstanding brew, and like NJBeerman said you should definitely take your time drinking this one to really enjoy all the flavors and aroma","Pottstown, Pennsylvania, USA","obxdude10"
713,"2002-06-27",3.8,"Wow... what an aroma.  Smells like a loaf of old fashioned rye bread in a pint glass.  Deep amber color.  Smooth malty texture with just enough rye flavor.  Definitely a drink to be enjoyed slowly.  Awesome stuff.","Hamilton Twp., New Jersey, USA","NJBeerman013"
