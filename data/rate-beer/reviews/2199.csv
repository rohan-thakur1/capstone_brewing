2199,"2014-09-18",3.3,"On tap at Fort Gibraltar for the Poutine Cup. Dark amber-brown pour with a thin tan head. Malty with dark fruit and caramel, a touch of hops. A nice Oktoberfest brew that goes a little beyond without ruining the style.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","ljthiessen"
2199,"2013-10-30",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 1, 2013 Really good beer overall! My local liquor store stored it at room temperature for about a week so I dont know how good that was for it. None the less though, I poured and drank each one out of a hour-glass styled cup (as recommended) and I really enjoyed it. It is a ""light"" for a German style Oktoberfest beer but there is many good options out in western Canada for a good beer of this type. I would suggest getting sometime, also loved the packaging- Makes for a ""fun"" beer!","Calgary, CANADA","marshallstrong"
2199,"2013-10-14",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2014 Cinnamon and spice scent, but unfortunately not very pungent. Rather light texture for an oktoberfest, which is sensible given that this is my first lager of this style. Absolutely delectable taste. Malt, very light roast, some minor spice that is certainty present, but not overwhelming, all followed by a tiny bit of hops to present one delicious tasting beer.","Manitoba, CANADA","YigSvartka"

Lable sates: ""Unfiltered, unpasturized, unadulterated""

Pours a luxurious hazey Orange-amber lager in my stein with a sticky, rocky 3 finger cap that stacked out of the glass. Laces the glass sides like sea foam on a glass oar. Perfect color and proper heading.

Aromas of toasty-bready-woody herbal tones... wisps of smoke....delicate and not over stated.Traditional aroma..perhaps the subtle nose is from long conditioning.

Rich body, thick buttery mouth feel, smooth rounded character.

Great big chew of toasted Munich cerials up front like liquid bread!!..then the woody tones from the Hallertaus and the herbal bittering from the Perle hops mingle mid palate with these rich malts leaving a mild complexity of musty-woodsy-earthy tones, some wallnut skins, unsweetened cocoa, burnt sorgum and a light smoke, all wrapped in a roll of fresh pumpernickel bread....finishes wet and malty with the hops gaining a bit of bittering to balance the whole drink. Has a nice after taste, like you just ate fresh bread dosed with a herb spread....then a nice warming from the alcohol...one bottle had my ear tips going red. ;-)

A beer that lives up to its label brag..A well executed Oktoberfest Marzen..thick, malty, satisfying, drinkable and intoxicating. This Brewer is off to a good start with this beer...I really hope its not just a seasonal.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"
