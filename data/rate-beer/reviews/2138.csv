2138,"2017-05-11",4.0,"This definitely has smoke to it, in both body and aroma. The flavor doesnt come heavy on rye, which is nice. This doesnt have any of the weird juniper flavors of the sahtis I had In Finland. Really makes me think of a smoked ale mostly.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
2138,"2017-02-28",4.0,"750ml bottle acquired from Binnys Naperville (Naperville, IL). May as well go big early on Fat Tuesday. Pours a darker brownish hue, a firmer haziness, touch of ruby glow on the edges with frothy full khaki head atop. Firm layer, nice retention and lacing overall. Aromas are very unique, stone fruit, wood, and a cherrywood smoked malt appeal meet some toastiness, carmelized and a bit biscuity. Some bitter and distinct juniper essence, the berries and pine needle like essence flows iecly over the top of the rye, chocolate, and biscuity malts beneath. A touch of molasses, mellow sweetness and darker appeal largely get covered up by a rustic and stone fruit smoky appeal. Very unique stuff. Initial is medium bodied, perhaps a bit lighter, certainly not as expected. Some chocolatey essence, rye and biscuit meet a cherry and smokey liveliness, biscuits, leather, an earthy appeal. Some bitterness, fuzzy, certainly dry and bitter backend, the juniper, smoked elements meld well. A touch of warmth (as to be expected) at times but overall, this strong smoked beer really works well. Granted, Im a smoked beer fan. The nose is rich, lush, and almost makes you think this might be a full and brooding experience. Not so. A healthy smoke and bitter appeal, subtle chocolate, rye, and toasty appeal up front. A bit of fuzzy warm ABV, a potent nose, a gorgeous pour, and frankly a beer that doesnt overwhelm or end up sweet or heavy. A healthy earthy smoke, biscuit, and toasty appeal, supporting bitterness and junuper elements. Just lovely stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
2138,"2017-01-31",3.2,"750mL bottle. Hazy cola-colored pour, medium off-white head with so-so retention. Nose is faint juniper hovering above big smoke ( a little too smoky to be honest), deep roast, cocoa, wood, gum arabic. Mouth is medium bodied, smoky, dark roast, bread crust, subtle rye spice, mild bitterness. An interesting brew and one that would probably have gone well with a hunk of meat, preferably cooked over an open flame (Im eating Doritos though, because Im stoned and I like crunchy things). Might grab another bottle and save it for a February BBQ in the snow (if it snows again this winter, that is).","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"
2138,"2016-01-16",4.2,"Hmm. My first (second time around) Sathi, until Ratebeer changes the style to Traditional Ale or something like that. 6 oz. pour at Liquor Barn (Springhurst). Aroma: Smokey, seasoned hickory wood with chocolate/honey malt base; intensely smokey; if theres a juniper addition, I cannot pick it out. Appearance: Cola black with soft carbonation holding up a ring of dark tan head. Flavor: Smokey all around, but chocolate/honey at its core; very rich and pleasing. The finish lingers a bit with woody ash. Palate: Medium body, sticky texture, soft carbonation, lingering finish. Overall: Delicious stuff; wish I could have brought home a growler. Would be pretty tasty while chopping wood.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"
2138,"2015-09-22",4.1,"10 oz at WoB LoDo. This beer is really dark with a well formed tan head and ruby tints noticed in the clear body. The aroma is very smoky, pear wood apparently has a pretty pungent affect. There are notes of caramel, ash and sweet fruits. The body is pretty big with a smooth palate. This is a sweet beer, but well balanced by the layers of fruity smoke. There are flavors of honey, rye spice, chocolate, caramel and the aforementioned heavy smoke. Thoroughly enjoyable beer.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
2138,"2015-09-01",3.7,"Tap at Upright Brewhouse. Deep dark brown with fine head and moderate lacing. Nose is smoke and fish sauce. Tastes of smoky wood, fish sauce, malt, plenty of honey, touch of bacon. Sticky and creamy mouthfeel. Today is filled with highs and lows.","New York, USA","Jow"
2138,"2015-08-29",3.3,"Aroma is full of smoked malt. A little sweetness on the aroma as well. Light mouth. Taste is very smoky. A little sweetness as well. Thin head. Hints of nuttiness and some smoked meat.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","dinkle50"

Medium to full body, creamy texture, soft carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.

I got a little taster of this and thought it was interesting enough to get a full glass of...but what worked fine in a small sample just could not hold up very long...I started finding somewhat unpleasant odors mixed in with the fun stuff, and the unbalanced sweetness and somewhat unpleasant aftertaste grew tiring faster than I expected. I ended up only drinking about 3 or 4 ounces before pushing it away and moving on to something better.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2138,"2015-06-09",3.6,"Draft. Deep brown and clear with a short tan colored head. Aroma is substantially smoky and peaty with notes of juniper, soil, nuts, wood, holly, vulcanized rubber, and dark caramel malt, with mineral-like oyster shell and phenolic engine grime showing up with more time. Medium-full body, rich and burly, moderately sweet with low bitterness. Fluffy carbonation and rich malt succulence work well with the aromatics.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

2138,"2015-05-21",3.6,"Draft from Whole Foods, labeled a Gotlandsdricke - first one Ive tried, and it is good. Supposedly an old Nordic style, but this seemed like a sweet rauchbier to me. Very smoky, with a flavors of pumpernickel, carob, and cinnamon. Fairly smooth, with well-hidden high abv, and good overall.","USA","Slipstream"
2138,"2015-04-29",3.7,"On draught
Pours a very dark brown with ruby hues when held up to the light. The head is of a medium size and the lacing is nice looking. 

The aroma is peaty & smoky, earthy, chocolaty, and very pungent. Its a richly smoky and sweet smelling beer. 

The flavor is peaty and scotch like. Its got flavors of molasses and cocoa. Its sweet, its spicy & its a little salty with some mild woodiness. Mostly its peaty and smoky though. 
Certainly enjoyable","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
2138,"2015-04-18",3.6,"on tap at Blue Monk, Buffalo NY. black pour, fuller mouthfeel. Lots of smoke, peaty earthiness. roasted malts & more smoke. i liked it","Buffalo, New York, USA","swoopjones"
2138,"2015-04-16",4.3,"Look - Im only docking it for the light head.

Smell - Wet cigarette smoke clothes and sour. 

Taste - Growing up with a chain smoking dad I never thought Id say this, but cigarette smoke tastes good! The sour hits right before the finish. There is no campfire, all cigarette. 

Feel - Milk stout feel. Not quite the consistency of milk, heavier. 

Overall - I got this in Ohio. That is unheard of. I wish I had tried Off Color in Chicago. Think cigarette put out in milk, then say ""Oh yeah, tastes good.""","Columbus, Ohio, USA","madelfonatree"
2138,"2015-04-15",3.5,"Draft. Almost completely black color. Aroma of burning wood and kindling, but with no meatiness to it. Taste is burnt fruit, more smoke. More interesting than the small handful of others Ive tried in this style, but a lot more alcohol.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
2138,"2015-03-28",3.5,"The sampler, brooklyn tap: pours near black with little head. Aroma is smoke, sou sauce, and cigars. Tastes kind of like a stout, but not quite... Plenty of smoke. Good amount of soy sauce. Someone else noted fish sauce but i didnt get any in my tasting. Good, but not what i was expecting.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
2138,"2015-03-12",3.5,"Draft pour at beermiscuous. Smells like my clothes after camping all weekend in front of a fire, with fruity cologne drizzled after. Black with a little head.
