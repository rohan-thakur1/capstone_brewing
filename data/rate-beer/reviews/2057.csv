2057,"2015-07-19",3.4,"Type: 12-oz. bottle
Glass: Karl Strauss 26th anniversary snifter glass
From: Barons Market in Alpine, Calif. 
Price: $3.99
Purchased: July 18, 2015
Consumed: July 18, 2015
Misc.: N/A 

Poured a honey, caramel, hazy color with 1-to-2 fingers of off-white rocky head, which thinned out rather quickly. A few bubble streams coming up from the bottom along the sides. Poor lacing on the sides. Below average-to-poor retention. (Sight - 3.75)

Smelled honey, caramel, sour fruit, pear, apple and earthy notes, ending with sharp peppery cloves. (Smell - 4.13)

Taste pretty much follows the nose, although not as good. Got pear, apple peel, light apple juice, caramel, sour or slightly spoiled fruit, honey, pepper and candied cloves. (Taste - 3.75)

Light body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt finish. (Feel - 3.38)

This was only my third kind of this style, so Im not going to compare. This beer had its moments, but something just didnt work out as soon as it hit my lips. Great value for $3.99 a 6-pack though. (Overall - 3.75)

Straight away, this beer is beautiful to look at, presenting a brilliant gold/light copper color with great clarity and moderate head retention. The enticing nose offers aromas of spiced orange peel and sweet bread.

2057,"2014-03-30",3.6,"12 ounce bottle from Beer Crazy. This beers 351st rating. 
Pours pretty enough, a nice deep golden, bordering on a light orange... or rust... but solidly in the richer end of ""golden"" Its got a big head and nice lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is spicy & bready with some light fruitiness... like pear & pineapple but these are faint. Its mostly like a hearty bread with some cooking spice, decently pleasant. 

The fruitiness comes out much more strongly in the flavor, its got a good bit of pineapple flavor and the sort of sweet on tart character that goes along with that. The beer is spicy, enjoyably so & in a way that does a decent job balancing the fruit character. The bitterness is light but well integrated. Its got some yeasty & bready notes, but pulls those off without giving a terribly muddled character. 

The palate is sharp, prickly, and a touch heavy.

2057,"2014-03-19",2.0,"Draught at Redbones, 3/14/14I was pretty excited to see this on tap, not having huge expectations, as its obviously the contract brewed (Susquehenna Brewing, I believe) version. But despite having mostly awful experiences with their drafts, you do occasionally get a good one (Keller Pils, Left Coast IPA).This was not to be the case.Clear amber body topped by a white head showing moderate retention.Sweet, simple, crystal malts in the nose followed by...more crystal malts and ending in...crystal malt. The slightest brush of Belgian yeast with a touch of fruitiness and light vanilla. Seemingly unhopped....In the mouth, we have the crystal malt from the nose and a similar lack of hops. Sure, biere de gardes arent hoppy styles, but I dont even taste bittering hops here. Its just all hard candy-like sweetness, buttercream, light raisins and a touch of red fruits. Absolutely unwaveringly simplistic, underattenuated and terribly cloying.Amazing that they were able to make a Belgian/French style this bad without any infections or technical flaws.Should have named it Southampton Single Malt Unhopped Series - Crystal 120.Maybe some day Ill get to try the real version (pictured).

Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with good strength.

Lingering notes of caramel, toast, bread, light fruits, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with decent robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. A bit too dry on the flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish.

Appearance: The body is a brilliant dark amber to copper with a tall slightly off-white head that is persistent, settling into a creamy full coating. This is an excellent looking beer.
Aroma: The aroma is sweet leaning with some malts with a presence of watermelon and strawberry with hints of peppery spice. The malts are a tad musky and a bit weak, but smells nice.
Taste: The intro is slightly fruity of strawberry but quickly gains watermelon overtones that are prominent with a mild malt base and a peppery watermelon finish. The finish lingers a bit spicy and lasts a bit.
Palate: Medium bodied with mild carbonation.
Overall: What a pleasant beer. This is a Spring seasonal, but I would like this in the Winter. The lingering spicy finish is perfect for the Winter.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Appearance: Served up a clear, orange-esque body with a thin head, white in color, a bit scant due to the generous pour you can get in these places.

Taste: Sweetish at the start, then, a bit more sweet, with a sip of caramel-flavored water growing into a fuller caramel taste. A bit of bread as well as some yeast-laden dough. Fruity traces of apple and peach. No more than a hint of herb with a light bitterness imparted from the hops. Small hint of the alcohol on the drying, growingly tangy finish.

Finish feels a little rustic, I guess typical for the style, not unlike a Saison. Mostly citrus and spice. Just enough hops to make it a refreshing spring beer - ""Beer of March"". The style is obscure to me but this was tasty.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","scarletfire65"
2057,"2011-03-15",3.9,"12 oz bottle. This beer pours a light golden copper color. Great grape notes in the aroma balanced with a touch of malt aroma and slight sweetness, very reminiscent of some traditional Belgian strong ales. Great medium to light mouth feel with a somewhat silky smooth mouthfeel. Great malty sweetness up front that gives way to slight grape/wine notes and ends with a slightly dry sweetness characteristic of the malt. This is my first Biere de Garde and I can say that I am pleasantly surprised. This is an very enjoyable beer that would pair well with many different dishes however I cant compare it to the style since I havent had any others. Overall: (A).","New Jersey, USA","Allara"
2057,"2011-03-12",4.0,"12 oz bottle courtesy of TheEpeeist. Pours with a only slightly hazed golden body with a thin off-white head that stays for a little while. Aroma is pretty awesome while still being restrained. Glorious cereal, rich malty aroma with pear, coriander and sage. Floral. Really nice smelling! Flavors of flowers. Really floral, lightly spiced and lightly peppery. Beautiful bready and cereal like malt profile. Very easy and pleasant to drink. Nice firm bitterness in the finish that fits perfectly into place.

2057,"2011-03-07",3.6,"From a 12ozer into a snifter.  Pours a beautiful blazing orange color.  Little to no head and zero lacing.  Aroma of plums, but its very faint.  Mouthfeel is stupendous.  Smooth but with some body and a small but present carbonation.  Taste is of dark fruit and spices; much like a dubbel, but without the Belgian funky taste.  Plenty of spices too.  Im not a big fan of spiced beers at all.  However, the spicing on this one is not over the top and it adds to the flavor profile.

Low resin and a mild woody tones, good mix of faint bread, caramel, cereal, nuts.  Hint of orange rind.  Malt-forward medium body edges towards full, crisp and super refreshing.  Alcohol is smooth and streamlined, no warmth or burning, but does contribute body.  Fruit is hinted in the British way, and here only in the wisps of the aftertaste.

Palate: smooth, creamy, and soft then dry, crunchy, and spiced. Pie crust in the back golden brown and crispy. Cinnamon and nutmeg tickles while apple and pear delight, their skins crisply sweet then bitter, their essence gently permeating her body of maple and spice. Essence of autumn.

2057,"2010-04-26",3.9,"This has been on my wants list for awhile now-and I was surprised to come across it in my local mix & match store in a 12 oz bottle. 12 oz bottle poured into a flute glass.

A- Crystal clear bright gold hue. Pours with an approximately 1 finger soapy white head that eventually fades to a thick collar. Minimal traces of lacing is left behind in the glass. Bubbles can be seen constantly rising to the top.

S-Initially the nose seems like a mumble jumble of hops, malt, and spices that are difficult to discern. Upon further investigation the hops are definitely floral, the spices are perhaps cinnamon and nutmeg, and the malt adds a nice sweetness. Nose is light and crisp.

T-Spices are the highlight upfront and there is a nice sweet malt and spicy yeast backbone. The hops kick in for the finish to add a crispness but a rush of spices and slight doughiness come through as well-then all that lingers is a minimal refreshing hop bite and a hint of spiciness. -finish is pretty abrupt and crisp. At first-it confuses the palate-but then becomes subtly complex and very drinkable.

P-Carbonation is medium and very tingly. Body is very light-consistency borders on a light biscuit-but never really completely goes there.

O- This is a very interesting, refreshing brew. I like it and think its good-but even the very minimal biscuit doughiness it offers is almost a turn-off for me. Overall I think this is a great, drinkable, light, refreshing, spicy biere de garde. I am happy it is now offered in 12 oz bottles and available in my area.

After enjoying a bottle of the Southampton Biere de Garde so much I was very happy to track down the Biere de Mars. Light pour, modest head. Gentle maltiness with an orchard touch, highly drinkable and quite laid back in its overall presentation.

Flavors show a similar baked bread, fruit and honey texture; bristling with complexity in the malt flavors, but brisk and tight overall.  Dustiness and noble bitterness provides a soft crisp sensation, thats well tempering.  Vanilla and other extraneous sweet tastes cling to the edges; with some acerbic, seedy touches drying it out nicely.

2057,"2008-03-24",3.6,"On tap at Zenos Pub.This is officially one of the weirdest beers Ive ever had. Ive never had flavors like this. Unfortunately, its not necessarily a good thing. Aroma is soft. A light, minerally soap character runs through. Artificially floral, but fine. Pours a paler amber, with a really, soft velvety soap on top in off-white. Bubbly. Flavor overwhelms in this incredible dish soap flavor. Solid, blue Dawn dish soap. Gross. Im having trouble drinking this beer. It tastes like my childhood. Really  fake and overly orange flavored. But, halfway through the pint something magical happens. This character dies down and morphs into an incredibly deep and complex, earthy rich spice. My palate grows used to this overbearing soap character and starts to pick out the delicate sandalwood notes, the fresh lemongrass and some palpable cedar. Its earthy, woody and delightful. A fresh, juicy european hop cone balances this out over a mineral yeast profile, and lightly sweet tea-like sugar. The bottom third of the glass is for savoring. I dont know how to interpret this. So hard to swallow at first, so delightful in finishing. Complex...confused? Interesting, regardless.

2057,"2008-01-28",4.1,"Golden amber in colour, thin but lingering white coloured head, some light lacing.  The aroma is of spices, plenty of orange and lemon citrus, bretty, yeasty, light sourness.  The flavour is of citrus and spices, some pineapple, lots of pepper, a bit of barnyard but it works very well, yeasty.  Lightly sour mouthfeel, lightish body, medium carbonation.  Finishes lightly acidic, lingering, light alcohol.  Pretty nice stuff, age might be a factor but for me it added a fantastic element to this beer.

2057,"2007-07-06",4.4,"Hazy dark orange pour with a huge yeast cloud in suspension. A small, creamy and very tightly compacted off-white head forms and remains throughout. Light sheets of drooping lacing. Tons of sediment particles. The aroma is nicely spiced and well-rounded. Notes of coriander, Belgian yeast, noble hops, grassy plains, herb gardens, flowers in bloom, very sweet malt and peach nectar. Alcohol is undetectable. No flaws noted, no DMS, no diacetyl. Just a soft aroma of springtime. The flavor is lightly bitter, very earthy and herbal, with additions of sweet and sour fruits and rustic barnyard nuances. Hops in the aroma combine with ample but never excessive yeastiness to create a soft, succulent blend of spices. Acidity is reserved until the country-feeling finish, where bitterness and drying start to come into play. the length of the finish is superb; its also a very clean and caressing style of earthiness, leaving lingering floral hints and touches of sweet caramel. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with soft carbonation thats flows freely and keeps the whole experience very upbeat. Exceptionally creamy and balanced, never bogged down by any weighty, unneccessary, overdone additions. This is a fantastic blend of hops, malt and yeast. Everything is plentiful yet reserved in its agression, resulting in a feeling of authenticity and a true love and skill in brewing this difficult to master style. A wonderful beer, brewed with a degree of craftsmanship that should render any fan of the style speechless. At least, speechless long enough to soak in all these wonderful subtleties.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Theres such a fine line between freshness and infection sometimes and some beers, with some malt elements, deliberately flirt with and cross that line. Fantome Printemps, Victory Prima Pils, and Cisco Summer of Lager all infect a bit like this, but one can still, easily after a number of tries, get at the bottom of the base beer. One can predict the course of the decay. Others are Fantome Noel and Bells Best Brown.  I totally love these examples. This beer smells a bit like the acidity when you chew leather, but with a nice dose of going south, wet peaches. Musty and just plain brown, there is the back of the throat flat tingliness that signifies Strisselspalt - damn, its like blood and the two parts of a 9 volt on your tongue and smells like earth.

Phil sure knows what the hell hes doing.  This guy is making some of the most authentic French and Belgian style beers in the States, without question.  His saison and this biere de garde are on a par with the best in Belgium and France, and thats an extremely rare thing.  This style requires a very tight and characterful balance of malt, yeast, AND hops to get it right, and damned if he didnt nail it.  Nothing short of amazing.  This made my jaw drop.  Only slightly less rich than Bavaisienne...drier finish as well, which makes drinking the entire bottle go too fast.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Light Orange.

Phenomenal aroma of honey, orange, butter toffee, caramel, light flowers and spice.

A well pronounced grassy and herbal hop profile greets my tastes buds, along with notes of butter and caramel, rhubarb, odd spicing and lemon. Yeast character of another Southampton beer reminds me of Fantome. Funky, complex, dry and very very good.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
2057,"2004-09-30",4.5,"Foggy pumpkin. Clumpy, sticky head of meringue density. Invigoratingly spicy aroma of perfume, fir, dandelions, and sprucey hops. Airy and immensely estery with pinches of mango, leathery yeast, and white pepper. Tight, yet fluffy, carbonation. Array of spunky, waxlike yeast flavors prevail atop an assorted tropical fruit overlay, which immediately lends softness to the body. Beautifully-placed note of peach fuzz and coarse ginger esters underscore the bright peach flavor, which deflects the perfectly-stated acidity and continually underlies the brew. Plaster and tangy wheat soften the alcohol spice. Extremely shy honeyed malt emergence comes and goes amid traces of mint leaf and glazed peaches. Harmonious interplay between the relentlessly spicy yeast attack and staunchly round hop anchor. Takes on a leafier, dried herb flavor, post-swallow, accompanied by a  drying minty alcohol effect and a crescendo of zippy yeast, white pepper, and glazed peaches. A voluptuous Fantôme-esque farmhouse rendition, teeming with Brewers' Gold and complex/funky yeast character. Closer to Saison than Biere de Garde, though.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2057,"2004-09-12",4.3,"I may be drinking this beer six months too late, in September, but you wont tell anyone, will you?
Lovely, lovely beer in the glass, a nice, hazy amber hue, a million tiny particles at play around and about, while a solid, 1/4"" head of creamy beige foam rests proudly on top.
Aroma is a beautiful mess, a musty citric mix of yeast and spice, a sweet and sour symphony, tickling the nose, urging on the tongue.
...and there, only nice things can happen, only happiness may occur. A warm wave washes over me when the brew slides down, it cheers up my every cell, and brightens each and every pore. Tastes good, too!
A lemony, bready, citric cakey quality reigns in the flavor, sparks the tongue, and pleases the palate. Little bit of green apples, cherries, honey, and certain spices, as well, and, in fact, theres much more happening here than I can authoritatively claim. Spicy kick on the buds only further enhances my enjoyment through this brew. Malt is thick, rich and sure, and hops provide treats aplenty.
Long, long, fruity, quirky, utterly characterful finish, medium body, brilliant flavor...an excellent creation, by any standard.
I can see many uses for this beer, cheif among them: drinking.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
2057,"2004-08-23",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 29, 2005 Sweet and spicy aroma with a pronounced hoppiness and lots of fruit. Opaque, dark copper coloured with two finger white head that lasts nicely. Earthy bitterness with sweet, candy-like malt flavour. Notes of citrus-orange. Spicy hop flavour. Engaging carbonation is lively on the tongue. A beer you want to caress... Bottle. Enjoyed with MartinT and Rastacouere.  Original Rating was 9-4-9-4-18=4.4 from August of 2004.  Resampled at the brewpub in September of 2005 and bumped the scores down a bit.  Still an enjoyable beer, but less so than in the previous year.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"

2057,"2004-08-23",4.1,"Cloudy orange bodied with a nicely laced white head sticking to the snifter. Big malty aroma. Baked malt, cookies, bready dough and clove-ish yeast. Candyish donut sprinkles. Somehow hoppy too, though its subtle and definitely not an/some american hop(s). Rather yeasty palate which procures a moderate dryness all the way through. Very surprising taste after smelling, both are very different with a sweet aroma and a dry palate. Youve got to respect a beer that surprises you. Still, I found cloves flavors to be a bit overstated, but I love the gentle mustiness, earthy and cerealic (almost oaty) flavors. Nice balancing ending bitterness. Lively carbonation, fluffy mouthfeel. Much more flavorfull than I anticipated. Great execution (of course)","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2057,"2004-08-19",3.6,"Orange with a huge foamy head, perfect lacing. Nose is grassy, lightly spiced and heavy on alcohol.  Light bodied, some faint citrus notes, moderate alcohol upfront. Spices are faint but add to the light complexity of this biere de garde.  Such light body with underlying complexity make this a great dinner companion.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
2057,"2004-08-19",3.8,"white grape, red berry and freshly upturned earth aroma with a bit of a whiff of alcohol. a little darker than expected. hints of caramel, tinned pear, lightly peppery in the finish. not a whole heap of yeast character but pleasant spring drinking","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
2057,"2004-07-28",3.8,"Pours a hazy orange-copper color.  It is pretty well carbonated, which supports an off-white to tan colored head.  I get sweet fruity aromas of pear and apple up front, as I dig deeper I get notes of toasted biscuits and malt, plus some subtle spice notes as well.  The beer is fairly dry up front, with an initially gassy middle and a sweet cider like finish.  This is another fairly clean, yet interestingly malty interpretation of the style.  Almost has a meaty-chewy malt character to it.  This is quite tasty and has a hearty medium bodied quality to it that is most likely from this being an all malt interpretation of the style.  The fruity yeast notes are nice, though it could perhaps use some more yeast spiciness, but this is a rather weak complaint on this otherwise wonderful beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2057,"2004-07-27",3.6,"Pours an almost glowing amber/orange brew with a thick whipped cream head. Some spiciness and alcohol in the nose. Medium bodied.

2057,"2004-07-25",3.4,"feint alcohol aroma, spicy flavor. very easy to drink. This would be a good beer to have w/ a nice formal dinner, the mild spice & tang in the flavor would do well to complement food","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
2057,"2004-07-15",4.2,"Deep clear copperish-amber ale, huge white head.  The nose is full of spice, malt, apple, grass, and a slight hint of funky barnyard.  Flavor is similar to aroma with a semi-sweet, earthy, peppery, yeasty dryness.  Very complex and takes some work to figure it out.   Medium bodied, fizzy carbonation,  mojave dry finish.   SH does no wrong.  Underrated if you ask me.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
2057,"2004-07-09",4.1,"Poured a cloudy orange with a huge foaming head and really cool lacing. Aroma of equal proportions of spice, citrus (apples and orange) and malt. The taste is complex with all of the forementioned characteristics along with an earthy dryness and mustiness. Notes of grass also.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
2057,"2004-06-20",4.1,"The beer extricates itself from the 750ml green bottle an obfuscated copper color, the head Brontosauric in size, creamy in texture and after dissolving the lace forms a thick and clinging blanket upon the glass. The nose has a the aroma of over ripe apples with a nice yeast presence, citrus crisp, also notice a hint of mustiness, a fine sniffer this one, start is lightly sweet, pleasing malt presence with the top light to middling in feel. Finish is ferine in its acidity, the hops dynamic in their spiciness, very dry aftertaste, a very fine representative to the style, quite pleasing to the palate and a great beer to share on Fathers Day with all the fathers past, present and future","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"

2057,"2004-05-20",4.2,"I liked this one quite a bit.  Pours a amber color thats clear besides all the floaties dancing around.  The head is off-white and smallish.  Aroma is yeasty sweetness mixed with some candy and some spice.  Flavor is very yeasty in the Belgian sort of manner.  Sweet and sour balanced very well.  Very tingly and dry in the mouth.

2057,"2004-04-10",3.7,"I don't think this is the best bier de garde from southampton, but it was definetly drinkable.  Not as full-bodied or sweet or spicy.  This beer also has less alcohol I think, so maybe it wouldn't keep as well.  Some grapefruits and strawberries here, fairly hoppy.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"
2057,"2004-04-10",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2004 [draught] Looks strikingly like the French Christmas - sticky, lasting lacing - earthy aroma of hay, some light fruits - this is quite hoppy for a biere de garde, perhaps too much so - I would argue with Jokes about them balancing the beer - the creamy, malty flavors of honey, caramel and some barnyardy graininess are quite present, but there is something about the hops (perhaps the style they used) that don't seem to go well with the other flavors for me - I love SH, and this is still quite a good beer, but this is shy of a hit for me.  [re-rate] had again from a growler and was a bit more impressed - hops seemed to dominate a bit less and the dry, somewhat fruity finish was quite enjoyable.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
2057,"2004-03-25",4.3,"Amber colored body with a fluffy white head.  Light, sweet aroma with honey, tart apples, orange and crisp, grassy hops.  The smooth, creamy malt dominates the flavor with fresh cereal and a bit of caramel.  Fruity esters emanate from the obviously Belgian yeast.  The hops are not overbearing and give a nice balance to the light but dominate malt.  Long, lasting finish with nice fruit and a bit of warming.

Sparkling clear, golden/yellow ale with a creamy, white head that retains well and has nice, creamy, ink-blot lacework. The flavor and aroma are spicy and fruity. Well-hopped with a tiny alcohol bite. Medium-bodied with a watery mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Lengthy, dry, bitter finish. Very nice brew... and the score reflects it as this is not even close to being one of my favorite styles.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
