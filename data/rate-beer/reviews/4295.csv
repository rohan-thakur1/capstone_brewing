4295,"2015-02-18",3.2,"Bottle.

Head is initially small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing.
Body is medium yellow.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain/bread), lightly to moderately hoppy (flowers), with a hint of soap.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.

As with the Fest Red, this is too high in alcohol to really be a ""session"" beer, but whatever. Other than that, I have no complaints...the aroma has only limited appeal (simple and light), but its clean and balanced in the mouth, if perhaps a shade too sweet. All in all a decent rendition even if it fails to excite...and its certainly a bargain at about a buck a bottle!","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

4295,"2015-01-27",3.9,"Little stubby bottle from Whole Foods, a 12 pack for about 11 bucks. Pours a bright golden yellow color with a small white head after it settles. A nice light floral, pepper and pils malt nose. The flavor is robust sweet fruit, hops, honey, pepper, damn this is drinkable. Very fruity and hoppy with clean sweet malty bases. Lemons and oranges. Lovely. So easy. Super clean, light graininess.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"

4295,"2015-01-26",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2015 Bottle. Clear amber gold with a medium-sized and lasting white head. Aroma is toasty / bready with more depth than Ive found in other Full Sail lagers... the toasty baked baguette effect is present, complimented by noble hops, which provide an enjoyable pepper / lemon impression.  Most importantly, the fermentation is clean, and it has a mineral quality similar to Franconian Lagerbier. Medium-light body is malty and toasty, light to medium sweetness, carbonation is fine and relatively low, bitterness is moderate and balanced. Its more interesting in the aroma than in the mouth, where the malt is more basic / toasty / caramelized from the small amount of Vienna or Munich malt.  Clean and flavorful and balanced and very drinkable. Full Sail doesnt nail every lager they try, and they have shown worrisome inconsistency in the past, but Im happy to see the first run of this Helles in good shape (no huskiness or DMS as other reviewers have said).","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
4295,"2015-01-25",3.4,"Lovely noble hop aroma, pours bright golden. Bready malt followed by sharp noble hops. Lively carbonation. Very nice to this point but a hint of vegetal at the end. Would be an awesome beer without that.","Kansas, USA","superdaveo"

4295,"2015-01-14",3.1,"Clear golden with 2 finger width frothy head. Hay and honey aroma. Taste of honey with a floral hoppy kick. Watery palate. Nice cheap and easy drinking if Im in the mood for something light with a little hoppiness.","","hockey9930"
4295,"2015-01-09",4.0,"Bottle. Colour...deep, clear gold with a thick white head. Nose...freshly baked rolls with biscuit cream, cut hay, Malt-O-Meal and a fervent huskiness. Palate...quite frothy, with a sharp burst of noble hop flavour and plenty of bitterness. The mid palate remains pleasantly sharp with notes of jasmine tea, Arrow biscuits, celery root and slight hints of caraway thyme. The finish is long and bitter. This is definitely one of the finest needs of this style, that Ive ever had!","Portland, Oregon, USA","neepsntatties"
4295,"2015-01-09",3.1,"11 ounce bottle from a 12 pack. The aroma on this has some sweet, lightly corny DMS and cereal character. Underlying mild noble hop grass character, too. Transparent yellow body with a medium, average dissipating white head present. Starts with a bit of a sweet, corny DMS flavor. Cereal malts follow. Finishes with a light, snappy, mildly bitter hop flavor. This is a well-priced beer, and a decent drinking one as well. Nothing earth-breaking, but serviceable.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
4295,"2015-01-09",3.7,"11 oz bottle from a 12 pack bought at Winco in Salem OR
$10.99
Pours a nice clear golden colour with a good sized white thick and creamy head.
Fruity and ,bread like aromas..Sweet pear, and slight herbal hop..nice.
Taste more dialed back but like the aroma wth a bitter kick in the end.
Palate is excellent for the intended ""sessioning"" its nice and medium light with a dry finish ..
Very nice beer..will be in my spring rotation.
Though at 5.8 a bit above a true sessioner.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"

The aroma is mild lemon, grain and floral. Really good.
The taste has a mild bitter start, then a moderate metallic bitter in the middle to end.
The texture is soft and fizzy.
Enjoyable.","Corbett, Oregon, USA","Fatehunter"
