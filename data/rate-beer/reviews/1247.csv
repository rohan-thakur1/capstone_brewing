1247,"2011-12-27",3.4,"Bottle.  Pours mahogany with some protein globules and a tan head.  Smells of rich roasty malt, some light spicy undertones, some fruity hints.  Tastes of chocolate, spicy, caramel, breaddy, some vegetal hints creep in on the finish.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
1247,"2009-02-03",3.5,"I had a Fordham Doppelbock and am not sure if DeGroens is an inset of Fordham or what.  This was a very solid Doppelbock.  Basically one big malt bomb.  Ill agree with the previous rater that this isnt going to replace a Celebrator but it is a solid tasty malty beer.  Very nice.","Greenbelt, Maryland, USA","ApisAles"
1247,"2008-01-20",3.4,"March 2006 - For a dopplebock from Maryland, this isnt half bad. Beer poured very dark brown with reddish highlights, a smallish head with some decent lacing. Flavor was caramel and roasty malts...sweet, but not overly so. A little hops balanced out the flavor, but mouthfeel a little thin. This isnt going to full you into thinking its Celebrator or Maximator, but this is definitely better than other local attempts (*cough* Troegenator *cough*) Ive had.","Middletown, Delaware, USA","Goodgrief"
1247,"2007-03-31",3.6,"12oz bottle acquired in trade with bstill (thanks!). Poured a deeper mahogany color wtih a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of toasted nuts, bready and caramel. Tastes of caramel, nuts, brown sugar, cookie dough, and some dark fruits. Light to medium alcohol finish.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
1247,"2006-06-11",3.6,"Poured a brown color (some reddish edges) with a generous head that laced well. The aroma was most strongly of caramel, some bread, some nuts, and spices. Alcohol was also strong and readily detectable. Flavor was as busy as the aroma, but again the alcohol was too prominent and squashed an otherwise decent take on the style. Finish did not have enough hops to keep this thing honest. Mouthfeel was sticky sweet, somewhat syrup-like.","","User37895"
1247,"2006-03-27",3.7,"Pours a transparent dark copper mahogany with a short-lived off-white head.  Rich, toasty caramel malty, cookie dough aroma has a nice authentic German doppelbock character.  Body starts with a sweet, viscous caramel sugar cookie flavor, with some earthy noble hoppy bitterness, mild metallic character and a drier, lingering warming finish.  Overall, very authentic and well-made.  Thanks to StewardofGondor for the chance to try this!","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1247,"2006-03-14",3.9,"Deep, translucent and ruby/garnet in color with a pillowy tan head that evaporates to a thin pond with a thicker wrung around the edges.  Aroma is a moderate delicacy - chocolate hazelnuts and mocha amaretto.  Deep, woodsy, and a bark-like earthen nuttiness.  Some wafts of whole wheat chocolate dinner rolls, cocoa powder and toasted oak.  Maple meets mildew, and brown sugar stirred in molasses reach the nose at the break of each sip.  Big flavor bill to fill.  Vibrantly thick substance oozes in while dusty milk chocolate and snapped pecan shells impart that nutty dimension.  Toffee bar, Heath transcendence with a noble hop boost that projects a slightly noticeable alcohol presence.  Thick and massive on the palate, churning as one fluid force, and quite oily at that.  Vibrantly jovial and eager at the edges, but all the balance contributors seem to be acting according to plan.  Chocolate encapsulated caramel chews, greasy mocha beans and a raw tree bark character enrich the ending, pursued by profoundly rich reverberations that ring long into the night.  Big thanks to Bstill for the bottle!","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
1247,"2005-12-31",3.8,"Poured a reddish amber color with a medium sized, creamy, off white head that left light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of caramel malts, roast, cereal, smoke and light citrus hoppiness as well.  Caramel, toasted malt, earth, roast and light alcohol in the finish.  Creamy mouthfeel.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
1247,"2005-02-01",3.8,"Another selection from the GABF.  I was in search for all the dopplebocks I could get my hands on.  Dark color with good head and lacing.  A sweet malty carmel taste that was very smooth.  An extremely good tasting beer.","Macomb, Illinois, USA","Crash"
1247,"2004-03-15",4.1,"Deep copper and browns with a fluffy tan head.  Lot of dark fruit, brown sugar, caramel, and fresh baked bread.  Rich, without being overly sweet.  This batch didn't show any of the ABV.  On tap at  Degroens, declared as 9% if I recall.  Medium to full bodied, nice soft carbonation.  Quite smooth and drinkable.  Worth a try if in Charm City.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
1247,"2004-02-01",4.1,"Dark copper appearance with a small head.  Fruity aroma with cookie dough-like sweetness. Full-bodied and filled with the rich, sweet malt taste of a really good bock.   Smooth finish with a bit of a kick.","Hanover, Maryland, USA","guzzler67"
1247,"2003-12-18",3.6,"Hazy copper body with beige head.  Aroms is medium sweet, cherry, caramel. Taste is the same, with some background earthy bitterness.  Strong alcohol evident as well in the full body.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
1247,"2003-12-11",4.0,"Nice head with big malt aroma.  Caramel, then caramel, oh how about some caramel (It is kind of like that Being John Malkovich movie scene where everyone said ""Malkovich"" and nothing else).  Anyway, typical doppelbock which is very true to style and fresh.  Alcohol flavor in aftertaste.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","wilkie"
1247,"2003-12-10",3.7,"Brown.  Phenomenal nose, hugely malty, sweet, toffee, just excellent.  Flavor does not live up to the nose's promise, as it's a bit thin.  Sweet, lacking depth, doesn't have the malts needed to back things up.  General consensus was this would probably be better had it aged a bit longer.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
1247,"2003-12-08",3.6,"Crystal clear, deep amber lager with copper highlights. Small, creamy, khaki-colored head.
The aroma holds nice notes of caramel and buttermilk.
The flavor is very malty and rich with big butterscotch.
Full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Lengthy, bitter, astringent finish.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1247,"2003-12-06",3.7,"Hazy copper with a small off-white head. Aroma has lots of very nice malt notes. Flavor is quite sweet, nutty and cherry flavors also abound. Medium full body and the alcohol makes its self known.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"
1247,"2003-11-29",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2003 [On tap] Cola-colored, with a full head that rapidly dissolved.  Hints of banana, clove, and just the slightest bit of kiwi fruit.  Well-balanced and full-bodied, this is an excellent doppelbock.  Wonderful maltyness.  Sweet, but in a balanced comfortable way.  The only flaw is I could easily feel the alcohol, but it wasn't very distracting.  Not much could be distracting when you're drinking this beer.","Westminster, Maryland, USA","LordHedgehog"
1247,"2003-10-06",4.2,"GABF 2003:  Clear orange/red color.  Dark malts and fresh bread in the aroma, syrupy (in a good way) feel, excellent smooth ending.  A great doppelbock.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"
1247,"2003-06-20",4.4,"On Tap at the Blind Tiger Ale House, NYC; 2002 Vintage: This one pours a clear copper color with a medium sized, mostly lasting, off-white head. The head leaves good lace on the glass and the aroma is wonderfully malty and sweet with a touch of molasses and brown sugar in the mix. It has a full body with soft carbonation and a full, rich, creamy mouthfeel that is ver satisfying. The flavor is full os malty goodness with just a hint of hop flavors present, which is just perfect for this style. A very nice doppelbock indeed.","Greenville, South Carolina, USA","Uglyradio"
1247,"2003-01-17",4.3,"Likely the finest Doppelbock I have tasted.  There is simply a ton of good, sweet malt here which never even approaches being cloying. Complex, rich, warm (but never too boozy).  Not too big, not too sweet, not too rich.  A good analogy would be what Victory did with the Imperial Stout style, this brewery has done with Doppelbock.","Annapolis, Maryland, USA","urbnhautebourg"
1247,"2003-01-03",3.9,"Possibly the best Dopplebock in America.  Avoids the sweet, syrupy, hints that other Dopples have.  Is a rich, dry, strong lager that provides a wonderful experience.  Far better on tap than in the bottle.","Dallas, Texas, USA","dukefan"
1247,"2002-12-20",4.2,"(Served from a growler) I always anticipate the release of this beer and I am never let down. The nose is straight forward exhibiting a pleasantly sweet malty aroma. The palate is full and rich with ample malt flavors intertwined with brown sugar. The hops are present but appropriately restrained for the style. I find this beer to be sweet, but not sappy. This beer has an OG 20 degrees plato and an alcohol content of 8.5% ABV, that indicates a beer that is well attenuated. Finally, the finish is long warming and delicately hoppy. Excellent Dopplebock!","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","HighGravity"
1247,"2002-03-29",3.4,"A very hoppy tasting bock.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","booyaatribe"
