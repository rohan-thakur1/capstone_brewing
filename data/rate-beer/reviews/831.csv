Misc.: N/A

Had a taster of this the previous night and really liked it. Had never heard of it before, but it appeared to be first reviewed way back in 2005. Perfect for this 108-degree weather. 

Poured a medium yellow, hazy color with two fingers of frothy, white head. Lots of bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass. World-class spiderweb lacing, great for a pilsner. Good-to-very good retention. (Sight - 4.25)

Smelled corn, hay, cereal, grass, green grapes, New Zealand dry hops, garbage, sulfur, and hints of dry pineapple, melon and stone fruit. (Smell - 3.75)

Taste is much better than the nose, getting Czech Saaz notes, specifically corn, hay, grass, honey, dry pineapple, dry green grapes, melon rind, cereal, sourdough bread and vegetables. Those New Zealand hops and hints of Galaxy are also among the tastes. This is very good. (Taste - 4.25) 

Light body. Thin texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt, grassy finish. (Feel - 4.25)

This was just a really good pilsner, perfect for this heat wave as well. Could drink this all day. Not quite as good as Pizza Port Pick Six, but close. (Overall - 4.25)

831,"2012-10-30",3.0,"Bottle shared by mdfb79. Thanks Dan.

The beer is yellow and mildly hazy, with a thick, white head that leaves ample lacing on the glass. The aroma is really floral, with light spice and hop notes. Unusual for the style, though not totally unappealing. The flavor is odd, overly floral, and not what comes to mind when I consider the style. Still somewhat enjoyable, though not up to Alpine standards. This one needs improvement.

S - Aroma is a mix of lager yeasts and lemon scents with a background of hops mixing in as well.

T - Starts off with a mix of lemon and lager yeast with just a hint of citrus hops in the background. Through the middle, the hop flavor gets a bit stronger and the yeast deepens to a bready flavor. The finish is a mix of strong lager and yeast flavors that linger nicely.

M - Medium-light bodied with moderate very lively carbonation. The beer feels very smooth and crisp and dry.

D - Very drinkable. Good balance of flavors with the hop forward taste. I actually really enjoy the hop flavor over what seems to be a really solid pilsner base.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"
831,"2011-07-25",4.3,"Aggressive pour into a pilsener glass revealed orange-lemon-colored brew with a a two-finger, white head which dissipated into a coating as it warmed. Nose was heavy with citrus, pine and earthy hops. Taste was a nice, light combination of citrus, toasted malts and mild spice with a refreshingly dry finish. I dont usually care much for pilseners, but this was VERY nice. I just wish Alpine distributed here because they just never seem to disappoint. Almost perfectly balanced, this is a winner.","Havertown, Pennsylvania, USA","regspeir"

831,"2011-07-20",2.8,"Bomber, fairly fresh.  The pour yields a lightly hazy, average golden-amber body.  A moderate head of smooth, off-white to eggshell colored foam settles slowly to a pronounced rim with a patchy center film.  Hard, sticky, stratified rings of lacing circle the glass.  The nose is massively hopped for a lager, prominently displaying notes of dry, peppery grass, aging wildflowers, and the whitest, driest part of grapefruit pith.  Bold cereal malts are dry on wheaty, coming across a bit stale, like day (or two) old bread.  Flavors evolve to show some sweet corn malt as well (not a welcomed addition), as the old cereal grows to match the potency of the grassy hops.  Its quite an intense profile, altogether, almost overwhelming.  The palate is medium-full and moderately carbonated, dry in spots, but finishing quite sticky and warm.  It drinks heavier than it should.  Im surprised to see 6% on the label, as after taking a few sips Id swear it was more like 8%.  Overall, I was disappointed by the brew.  Huge hops cant cover up an inherently flawed product.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

I still really dig this beer-its big for a pils, but its still sessionable.  strong piney note just before the finish, which fades into a lovely grassy/spicy hop finish.

Pours a clear golden color with a thin white head and only a spot or two of lacing on the way down. Very thin collar throughout. The nose carries floral hops and a bit of a tropical character in the background. Theres some light bready malt as well. The flavor is malty with bread, and theres actually a surprising amount of alcohol. Hops are there, with the floral ones dominating. Medium body with moderate carbonation.

831,"2005-07-09",1.9,"(Draft: OBriens in San Diego, CA) I simply cannot understand the recent fascination with great brewers trying to make a bad beer.  This is a bit different from the typical pale lager, but I cant say its any more enjoyable.  Lightly hoppy, minimally malty with a mild sweetness, but theres a fairly strong sourness to this beer, kind of a lemony citrus.  Just not a pleasant tasting beer.  The nose is also quite sour, somewhat grainy, and very light on hops aroma.  Light-to-medium body, somewhat crisp I suppose, but that sour finish really hangs on the palate.  Medium golden color, very cloudy in appearance.  The average size off-white head quickly fades to a small rim.  With as many times as Ive mentioned sour, Im just hoping theres something wrong with this beer, or maybe theres some infection in the lines, so Ill give this another try the next time I see it.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
