A classic example of an octoberfest style beer, sent to me as an add on to a strange beer request from Dansting (again, big time thanks). Aroma has the hallmark example of an octoberfest - caramel, toasty, some light herbal/grassy hop angle. Lightly malted with a touch of caramel sweetness, clean flavors with a nice earthy bitter finish. No flaws noticeable in any way, and the closest I can think of a great ""fest"" beer like this was Kostritzer, which IMO is great company to be in. Very well done.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

Great amber color with lots of bubbles rising to the top but a small amount of white foam. Great looking beer. Taste is refreshing, just hoppy enough with malt sweetness taking over at the end. This is what an Oktoberfest should taste like. Its an understated style; a lot of brewers try to do too much with it. Palate is not as fizzy as the appearance, slick and smooth.

The flavor is sweet fresh French bread and caramel malt with a nice light hop bitterness at the front sides of the tongue and a clean finish. Bready, sweet malt lingers in the aftertaste.

Nice honey colored pour, with a cap of fine off-white head. Some nice lace. Aromas of fresh cut hay, and a lively herbal green smell. Gentle sweet malt. The restrained character of the aroma makes the flavor all the more surprising. This is bursting with a rich, bright, toasty maltiness. The closest thing Ive tasted in the beer world to a loaf of great French bread, right from the oven. Though the emphasis here is clearly on the malt, the hops make a nice showing in the finish, with a gently mouthcoating herbal quality. The palate is smooth, finely carbonated, and light.

2188,"2003-10-22",4.3,"Draft:  Glassy golden orange.  Sticky, milky white head.  Beautiful aroma of mineral, tangy malts, and sugared apple.   Fresh spicy hop undertones along with some toasted malts.  Restrained esters.  Round, toffeeish mouthfeel.  Starts with lovely bready malt flavors with soft earthy, leafy hop tones.  Decadent spicy hop/toasted malt interplay.  Finishes with a sublime biscuity malt quality with tracs of nuts, pale malts, and a touch of raw noble hops.  They've nailed it.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2188,"2003-10-20",4.4,"I really enjoyed this O'fest, it is probably one of the best I've ever had. I think they must have beefed it up since Indra had it. Lots of aroma for a Free State beer...malt, raisin, toasted oats and a touch of cinnamon (?). Sticky side-clinging head. Same maltiness in my mouth with a touch of ginger and cinnamon. Filtered orange tan hue. Lasting and firm mouthfeel. True to style.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
2188,"2001-10-23",3.3,"UPDATED: OCT 23, 2005 Light caramel-malt aroma.  Light copper/amber color, with not a lot of carbonation but average head.  Nice balance to this beer, as the just as the sweetness of the malt starts to fade, the hops are there.  Somewhat hoppy aftertaste; this is definitely a Free State beer.  Very much a lager, also, not so much in the vein of the Sam Adams or Petes Wicked.  Light in the way of maltiness for an Oktoberfest, but pleasant enough.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
