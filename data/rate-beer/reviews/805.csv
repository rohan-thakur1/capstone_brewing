Nose is very oily peach oily, vague sweetness, odd. Taste is bitter with hop resin & onion but there is also a weird sweetness which takes it down for me, strangely mineral,... insecticide hop oil. Very bitter, hop oil body, something odd, mineral, lacking malt presence. An imperial pilsner apparently, that makes sense I suppose.

Consumed: April 26, 2017
Reviewed as: American Double / Imperial Pilsner
Misc.: Bottled on March 23, 2017; Enjoy by June 21, 2017

Wife picked this one up for me on a recent trip to Costco. Anything with Maine Beer in the title and Im going to try it. Really liked Stones previous collab with Marble and Odell and I expected this one to be on the same line.

Poured a pale clear color with three fingers of frothy-to-rocky white head. A few bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass. Outstanding sporadic foamy lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.00)

Smell was kind of hidden for the most part in the beginning, but got better. Got dish soap, pine, lime, floral, hints orange peel, resin late, floral, icy grass (if that makes sense) and a touch of peppery spices.(Smell - 3.75)

Taste was slightly better. At least more flavors. Really got it right with the double/imperial pilsner. Got rather dank resin, bitter pine, hints of mango, lime zest and Amarillo spice. Nice balance, but slightly more DIPA than pilsner. Also lemongrass, more tropical notes and a lingering peppery spice. (Taste - 4.00)

Medium body. Oily texture. Lively carbonation. Abrupt, spicy finish. (Feel - 3.75)

This was pretty good but I was a bit disappointed overall. (Overall - 3.75)

805,"2017-05-01",3.0,"Pretty much what youd expect from an Imperial Pilsner with Stones name somewhere on the label. Massive resinous pine hops make their presence known immediately, citric and assertive and pervasive, vastly overshadowing the corn-laced grainy malts and apple-tinged lager esters. The bitterness turns the finish a tad medicinal; hoppy lagers can be good, but the sweetness inherent to imperial lagers doesnt quite mesh with Stones hopped-all-to-shit-and-back leanings, making for a beer that grows clingy and cloy as it warms.

805,"2017-04-20",3.3,"Pretty good, Im missing something with the scores though. Maybe it is because it is a little bit different. A pils 1st, initially a clean taste, though a bit tank and with some of the metallic qualities that make me think German hops. Then it deviates from pils as the mouthfeel gets fuller and silkier. Appearance is clear, gold, sparse lacing. Dry finish. Nose is grassy with a bit of pine and a shovelful of dirt. Well made.","Rochester, New York, USA","jb"

805,"2017-04-16",3.7,"22 oz bottle shared by ebone1988. The pour is a darker golden yellow with a thick white head that falls to a thin ring without much lace. The aroma is interesting. There is a nice bright hoppiness up front with a little malt mixed in. A light citrus comes in late, but its got a strong lager character on the back end. The flavor is a little more malt forward. Its not really good. The hops work pretty well and bring a nice bitterness, but the malts just fight it the whole way. The mouth feel is definitely thicker than youd think it would be. More of a medium body with a softer carbonation and a lingering malty and lightly bitter finish. Its interesting.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
