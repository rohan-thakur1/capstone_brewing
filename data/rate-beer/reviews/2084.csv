2084,"2017-06-03",3.3,"500ml bottle, drinking this a few hours after Brewers Gold to compare. Clear pale golden colour with a small white head. Aroma: fruity, hoppy, malty, slightly odd apple cider like aroma. Taste: fruits, malts, citrus, herbal, initially sweet with quite a bitter finish for the style. Medium body and carbonation, smooth mouthfeel. Expected a more intense Brewers Gold, got something very different, not entirely sure this is how it was supposed to taste. First person to review this in 10 years so I suspect it may have changed a bit.","Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, ENGLAND","LazyPyro"

2084,"2007-10-02",4.0,"Cask at the 3 judges in Glasgow. Minimal haze obstructs the light golden hue. Flowery and kinda perfumey, rather funky hops with a wild side. Not too grainy in maltiness, but slightly nondescript, letting most of the place to the hops. Fresh flavoured, bright and pretty aromatic. Limited minerals despite the light salty touch. Mellow melon undertones introduce the sandy, evolving bitterness. Tannic upon the finish that is bready and long-lasting. Good indeed, if not my favourite golden ale.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Golden colour. Great aroma here, with notes of citruses and grapes, yet on that low, pleasant level where it does not get overwhelming. Just plain subtle charm here.

Wonderful crisp fresh hop aroma with a creamy malt hint and plenty of grape. Gold is the perfect name for this. Without doubt the most golden beer I have seen. In the mouth the hops are obviously up front but there is plenty more. Bags of lemon and grapefruit but it is really nicely balanced by some sugary malt. Bitter finish that turns gradually creamy and it has awesome length for the style. Slips down amazingly well. Palate is simply excellent.

Beer tasting can be so subjective, many factors can supplement the way you feel about a beer, mood, company, place, time and even the weather. So on a fine sunny Saturday afternoon we approached a highly recommended pub by a slightly eccentric friend with great hopes. As we opened the door and the light flooded into the dark interior, instinct told us that this could be a rare moment of perfection, that and the pump clip pronouncing that Crouch Vale had produced an extra version of one of the Beers of Banbury Festival. This was June and the beer is a seasonal for dark and rainy February, we didnt ask! As I ordered (I held the kitty, a British thing I think) the radio from a far room started playing the seventies smoocheroo Barry White.

[we got it together didnt we
nobody but you and me
we got it together baby]

Four Pints of the Crouch Vale please Landlord, I pronounced.

[my first, my last, my everything
and the answer to all my dreams
youre my sun, my moon, my guiding star
my kind of wonderful, thats what you are]

With a touch of anticipation the first of the light brown beers filled the straight pint glass. The head cleared to a pale white smoothie, this looked good anyway.

[i know theres only, only one like you
theres no way they could have made two
youre youre all im living for
your love ill keep for evermore,
youre the first my last my everything]

The cool liquid was raised to my lips and a burst of fragrant hops splashed across my tongue, a crisp grapefruit tangy dry flavour filling the mouth.

[in you ive found so many things
a love so new only you could bring
cant you see if you,
youll make me feel this way
youre like a first morning dew on a brand new day]

In charges the balancing malt sweetness, but still the vital crispness holds on allowing the alcohol to add nose to the beer. This is Elysium and Paradise together and we are sharing it with Bazza.

[i see so many ways that i can love you
till the day i die........

youre my reality yet im lost in a dream
youre the first my last my everything]

Back to reality, beer tasting is subjective, I will hold off giving perfect marks but by heck it got close.","Banbury, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","imdownthepub"
