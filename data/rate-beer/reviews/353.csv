353,"2017-06-05",4.7,"Taste sample from 75cl bottle at Arrogant Sour Festival. It pours a clean golden color with a large white head. Aroma is rich and super complex with notes of hay, lemon peel, horse blanket, wet basement. Taste is dry and mega complex with more notes of hay, blanket, lemon, green apple, dusty basement. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this a phenomenal and fantastically balanced lambic, on the drier end of the spectrum.
