1796,"2017-01-27",3.8,"Apparence : Pas totalement noire au versement, beau col moka crémeux ayant une bonne rétention et laissant une bonne dentelle, carbonatation moyenne. 
Nez : Malt rôti en avant-plan, légers chocolat et sucre brûlé en arrière-plan. Nez tout de même équilibré. 
Goût : Malt torréfié, notes de café, finale sur le malt rôti amer et sur des notes piquantes rappelant le bois ou la fumée. Très sèche. Plus elle se réchauffe, plus le chocolat noir prend la place du café. 
Sensation : Corps tout de même mince, piquant en bouche, bonne longueur des arômes torréfiées. 
Bref : Jaime le profil de cette bière : torréfié, amertume assez prononcée, sèche, aucunement décadente, alternance de café et de chocolat noir. Pourtant, ce nest pas extraordinaire non plus : les saveurs tardent quelque peu à saffirmer, la torréfaction prend peut-être un peu trop de place et, surtout, le corps mapparaît trop mince à mon goût pour une bière titrant 9% dalcool.

Not bacony/meaty and nicely dry, seemingly. Very clean, no alcohol. Could use a bit of caramel/toffee but as is, it really highlights the smoke and I suppose caramel and toffee are not exactly a baltic porter mainstay...Assertive flavor shows a strong hop bitterness, lightly green and spicy. Smoke is ashy, strong and dry. Very, very rich, with a huge body and tons of sweetness. Between the ash, caramel and light booze, it seems the stuff is just too young or too sweet.

1796,"2015-11-12",3.7,"Pours pitch black and completely opaque with a frothy, two finger beige head that slowly settles into thick, lasting ring. Really good retention with streaks of soapy lacing left behind. 

Robust, slightly smokey aroma with hints of burnt wood, charcoal, smoked meat and campfire yet still retains porter characteristics. Not as intensely smokey as I expected but this allows hints of dark chocolate, toast, coffee and oatmeal to come through. Smoke stands out a bit more as it warms but its nicely integrated and not a complete smoke bomb. 

Viscous and full bodied with a slight creamy texture and a very nice, rich smoke flavor thats decently integrated into the roasted porter notes. Very dry and bitter up front with hints of charred wood, ash, charcoal and barbecued bacon countered by deeply roasted dark chocolate malt, burnt coffee and oatmeal. The ABV is well masked but the malt tastes more burnt than smoked. Lingering acrid bitterness hurts the flavor and drinkability a bit. Theres is a touch of sweetness balancing things out but this beer needs more of that. Im a huge fan of smoke beers but theres something slightly off here. Still, an enjoyable beer that Im glad to have tried.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Its near black with a fleeting tan head leaving a etched top. Smells of toasted malts, richly of bitter coffee grounds, some soil, some vinyl and a good chunk of leather. Flavor is very leathery with some meat flavor (well done flank sans spice), some soil - much less sweet than most baltics Ive had. Full bodied with sharp, but limited carb and an off dry finish.

1796,"2013-08-24",4.5,"Bottled January 2013.
Aroma is fairly malty with lots of dark chocolate and roast along with a smokiness that really compliments the malt. Hints of sweet caramel along with some raisin, fig and prune. I cannot really nail the smoke but it definitely isnt peat and has more of an alderwood or cedar character. 
Pours black with a fairly thick, creamy looking dark tan head. Head recedes slowly but steadily leaving moderately high lacing and small legs. Head does not recede completely but lingers in the middle and along the edges. 
Flavor starts with nice sweet dark chocolate notes and light roast. As it progresses you pick up more smokiness in the flavor. Only slight fruit notes, mostly raisin, plum and cherry. Finish has medium low bitterness with some lingering dark chocolate and smoke. Roast is more prevalent as it warms. Only slight alcohol notes. No hop flavor. Sweetness dies down as the taste proceeds. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is crisp but also slightly creamy somehow. The astringency is low but present due to the smoke and there is medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall a very nice beer. The smoke character is unique but not overpowering and instead rather complimentary. It has a really nice mouthfeel achieving a silkiness while being crisp. It could perhaps have a bit more dark fruit character but that might clash with the smoke.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

1796,"2013-05-23",4.0,"In short: A well malted and medium smoky black beer with just the right amount of everything.
How: Tap at Prohibition Pig, Waterbury VT.  Then a fresh 500ml bottle home.
The look: Very very dark mahogany body (pretty much black) topped by a medium tan head with good retention.
In long: Nose is medium smoky with a smoke character that is part smoked pull-pork and part campfire.  Body has a rich malt backbone with a velvety pillow texture with a perfectly levelled medium carbonation.  The malts offer flavors of chocolate brownies, caramel, almonds, all-grain brown bread.  The smoke is strong part of the flavor spectrum but doesnt overwhelmed the beer, this is smoky beer, not an uber-smoky beer.  Very nice meaty and woody smoke. More hoppy than usual for the style but less hoppy than usual for a Hill Farmstead beer.  The hop profile feels leafy, fresh tobacco and even a bit citrusy.  Despite a rich malty body the sweetness sensation is kept in check.  Very enjoyable offering, I preferred this base beer over all three barrel aged treatments of this beer I had before.

Appearance : Pitch black with medium brown head.

Palate : Creamy and silky palate. Moderatly soft carbonation. Nice palate as usual with HFB.

Overall : Really really nice beer. Im even wondering if this version is not better than the first batch which was BA. Awesome malt complexity that make you fell like theres no need for any barrel aging to make this a success. Really rich sipper with very faint alcohol notes. Something Id drink again and again.

1796,"2013-03-17",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
The intelligent dosage of peat smoked malts and roasted cereals give this Smoked Baltic Porter an edge throughout its cushion-y, creamy mouthfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam covers the darkness.
-This may not be the most complex of Baltic Porters, but it is extremely satisfying.
-Alcohol is very well hidden.
-Salty peat is also present in the aftertaste.
-The flavor profile is not too intense, not too shy. This is an elegant desert beer.

1796,"2013-03-11",4.1,"500mL thanks to briandot. Deep brown to near black pour. Thick latte foam. Good lacing. Mild soap in the aroma is thankfully volatile giving way to mild but very present applewood smoked bacon, more than its barrel aged counterparts. Rich coffe and dark chocolate are forefront though. Taste is dense, rich, melted dark chocolate bar; heavy near Black IPA density, spruce, obvious hoppy balance, applewood smoked bacon returns. Palate is awesome- silky, dense, mild alcohol warming works perfectly. Really digging this one. Another unsurprising masterpiece from HF.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
1796,"2013-03-10",4.5,"Bottled January 2013, 500 ml bottle into a tulip glass. 

A - Pours a dark, dark brown body. Just a shade below black. Two fingers of mocha foam settles to a one finger cap of long lasting foam. Excellent lacing and moderate retention.

S - Smokey malts, ham, chocolate, coffee and a nice mineral bite. The smell is just phenomenal, smokey and rich with just enough sweetness and bitterness to keep things in check.

T - Starts off smokey and savory. Smooth milk chocolate and bitter coffee beans come to the rescue to provide some balance. Finishes with lasting ash and sweetness. This is a top notch smoked porter. Very delicious with the perfect level of smoke. 

M - Medium bodied and creamy. Moderate level of carbonation.

O - Im not a big fan of smoked beers, but this is right up there with Alaskan Smoked as the best Ive ever had. Really great stuff.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Beer is flavorful and quite nice, with the smoke not overpowering everything.  While i prefer the barrel-aged versions, this turned out quite nicely.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
1796,"2013-03-08",3.7,"Bottle thanks to Blake!  Pour is dark brown with thin tan head. Aroma is lightly smoky with hints of cured meat and faintly sweet. Smoked beer for sure. Subtleness lost a little.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"
1796,"2013-03-07",2.5,"flavor and nose was very smoky.  tasted like everett got blazed off two dutchies jam packed with the sour diesel.. BOOOOOOM.

all the porter characteristics were there, however i felt this was overwhelmingly smoky.  by far my least favorite HF offering.","NYC, New York, USA","Godofthecellar"
1796,"2013-03-07",4.3,"Bottle poured...smoke aroma hits ya right away--like my flannel shirt after a -weekend of sitting round a campfire-alcohol is masked by perfectly balanced smokey malt with hints of chocolate.

1796,"2013-03-03",3.6,"My disdain for the BA versions of this beer saw me enter into this brew with the expectation that I wouldn't like it, and I'm happily surprised this isn't the case. I generally dislike smoked beers, yet the subtle smokiness here blends nicely with the richness of the malt base. Dry porter yeast concludes the experience on a high note. Quite good, as one would expect from HF.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"
1796,"2013-03-02",4.4,"This is the best use of smoked malts to date.  Really robust rich creamy baltic porter with the perfect amount of roasty smokey malts and a rich lightly sweet chocolatey base porter.  Wow I love it and Im glad i bought 6.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"

1796,"2013-03-01",4.5,"On draft at Hill Farmstead, this was my favorite beer of the entire vermont trip. Very De Molen esque Pour was dark brown, pretty much black with medium sized coffee head. Good lacing and staying power. Notes were super rich, roasty, peat, chocolate, sweet malts, marshmallow fluff, burnt caramel, and hops. Body was medium to heavy but never overbearing. No booze at all for the alc percentage. Liked this better then the french oak cabernet and bourbon barrel version. Cheers Shaun.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
1796,"2013-02-28",3.8,"Bottle shared by Leighton on the bus at RBWG.  Another new HF beer and from the dude who now lives across the big pond!  I will take it.  The base beer for those early baltic porter treatments, I did not realize this beer existed ; so it makes sense that its a new beer as I can see here in the CD.  Pours a muddy dark brown with a small yellow tan head, nice lacing as always with HF.  Nose is dark chocolate, smoke is there but not overpowering, light roast, coffee.  Flavor is similar, more easy drinking and BP-like than a smoke beer which is fine by me (not that i dont like the smoke!  I do I do!  )","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
1796,"2013-02-27",3.9,"750 mL growler.

Pours a dark, clearish  brown with a light brown head. Nose of smoked malt, cocoa, vanilla; more sweet than bitter.  Smooth flavor of a rich porter that is complemented by the smoked malt and not overwhelmed by it. I liked Holger Danske but Id think if that was too much smoke for someone, this would be an agreeable compromise with the fuller, richer body and sweeter dark fruit and cocoa like flavor.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","yourefragile"

1796,"2013-02-24",4.1,"Nice strong light brown head of fine and dense bubbles.  Head reduces slowly and leaves a nice sheet of lacing.  Smoked malts, terriaki sauce, dark berries and some roasted grains.  Color is a very dark brown.  Wow, very flavorful.  Lots of sweet malts, light smoked jerky meat, molasses, mild coffee and some licorice.  Mild alcohol presence.  Smoke is present but not overpowering at all.  Perfectly balanced.  Pretty clean finish with some lingering malts and roasted grains.  A very good and plesant brew to drink.  Thanks to Fredward for this one.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"

1796,"2013-02-21",4.3,"From a growler purchased at the brewery. Black pour with a mocha colored frothy head that lasts throughout the glass. Beautiful chocolate roast and soft but rich smoke lead to hints of brownie, cocoa nib, and bacon. Magical. A thick rich mouthfeel demonstrates a finish that is made satisfyingly dry by the deft combination of roasted barley and great attenuation.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"
1796,"2013-02-13",4.4,"Wow, wow. Pours thick dark coffee in color with a  creamy lighter caramel head. The aroma right away, as usual for HF, is accurate, potent, and pleasant for the style - this time bringingt perfectly balanced smoky notes and a campfire aspect with just a tad of sweetness, so nice! The flavor is quite similar, the balance of the smoked malts on a creamy body is excellent with a pleasant hoppiness at the end.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"
1796,"2013-02-06",4.2,"Pours very dark brown with a medium tan head...rich looking...nice lacing.  Aroma has wonderful dark chocolate with just a touch of bitter roastiness...almost espresso.  Flavor also brings the dark, bitter bakers chocolate and adds nice smokey/roastiness...light burnt/bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium/full and creamy with a roasty/smokey finish that warms pleasantly.","The dub c, Pennsylvania, USA","reggiedunlop"
1796,"2013-02-06",4.1,"On tap at the brewery & 750ML growler fill on 2/1/13. Enjoyed in a wine glass

A - Soft black, 1 finger muted head that fades slowly. 

S - Rye and Smoke on the nose, hint of chocolate beans and wheat

T - Lovely lightly smoked finish, hint of espresso beans and chocolate kisses. A hint of calcium in the middle of the tongue but it doesnt linger. 

M - Medium body, sharp carbonation that leaves pretty fast but with a tingling.

O - Very decadent and smooth, no alcohol bite or booziness at all, finish is neat and leaves you craving more. I really dont like any beers with smoke but this really excels.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
