Heckuva lager, even if they dont know how to spell ""Schwarzbier""... malt dominant , but not overly sweet, with a smooth, softly-carbonated body. Probably one of the best of the style Ive had, if not the best. (15/20)

4363,"2014-11-05",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Toasted bread generosity moves into roastiness, as herbal hops freshen up this lean and soft Schwarzbier.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A tower of foam slowly crumbles into the brown-edged black.
-This is very drinkable for a 7%+ brew.
-That being said, the 7% is not necessary at all. The same flavors and body would have been great at 5% (like most German Dunkels or Schwarzbiers).
-A lightly fruity acidity increases drinkability.
-This is authentic, despite the high abv.

Shared with a friend.  The beer poured a coca-cola colour with a brown head.  Aroma was roasted malt, coffee, and some molasses.  Mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation.  Flavour was well balanced between the coffee roastiness and the molasses sweetness.","Milton, Ontario, CANADA","cyrenaica"

Wine like initially, and a chocolate taste, thinner than expected for the style.Roasted, but some astringency in the finish. so-so drinkability owing to flaws.

Aroma of cocoa, sweet molasses and grass. Taste is yeast/chocolate and coffee finishing with a nice grassy bitterness. Alcohol is hidden and it is very easy to drink. Very nice example of the style","Alberta, CANADA","Reimer96"
4363,"2012-12-08",3.6,"(650mL bottle from Sleepless Goat, Kingston ON) Pours dark brown/black, frothy tan head that left lacing. Aromas of roasted dark malts, chocolate, a little molasses-like sweetness and grassy bitterness. Flavour fairly closely matches the aroma, malts balanced between roast and sweet with some grassy hop bitterness, nuts and a bit of dried fruit. Finishes fairly dry. Alcohol hidden, smooth, moderate carbonation and fairly hefty mouthfeel for the style. As far as schawrzbiers go, a very good one.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

4363,"2012-11-19",3.5,"Very decent for a schwarzbier. I usually dont like the style much. Pours black/dark brown with a little head and lacing. Smells boozy and malty. Taste has some fruitiness, some sweetness and a bit of nutty bitterness. Medium carbonation. A little spice in the aftertaste as well. Tap at Barhop.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"

4363,"2012-11-07",3.8,"Shared with PaleAleRider at Pub Italia in Ottawa, ON. Written on front label, packaged SEP 24 12. Pours a dark brown colour with red highlights. The head is big, foamy, beige coloured, long lasting and with dirty lacing. Beautiful roasted malt aromas with notes of dark fruits, coffee and molasses. No alcohol burning at all, not even warming. Goes down refreshing with a silky mouthfeel. Nicely balanced between the roasted malt and hop. Not too powerful, making this a beautiful strong schwarbier that has great drinkability. Was great with the food from Pub Italia. For those who want the flavours of a dark beer, but not the heavy body.","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"
4363,"2012-10-31",3.5,"UPDATED: NOV 1, 2012 October 31, 2012 - on draught at the Bar Hop Black & Orange Fest. Deep ruby-black, large lovely creamy lasting tan head (4+). Simple Schwarz aroma - light roast, dried grassy bitterness, not much alcohol or sweetness. Taste follows, a tad lactic. Appropriate flight body, good carbonation, increasing bitterness and a bit of molasses in the finish. Nice!","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
