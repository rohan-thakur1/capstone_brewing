581,"2009-03-19",3.4,"From a growler from DuffManSW, thanks Sean, shared with mspindler and the guys at Hangar 24. Dark gold pour with a fluffy white head. Slight hop aroma too it, someone was saying it smelled like pot, kinda did after it warmed up. Slight bitterness in the flavor, pretty smooth afterwards, pretty decent overall.","Redlands, by way of Wisconsin,, California, USA","Hophead22"
581,"2009-03-14",3.3,"On tap at OBriens. Listed as an Abbey Dubbel. Pours with a slightly hazed dark brown body and a small, fading brown head. Aroma of raisins, brown sugar and hoppy bitterness. Taste is belgian yeast, and by far the most bitter (hops) abbey ale I have ever had. Finishes strongly bitter. Apple, raisins and dough accompany the bitterness. Water like mouthfeel, light carbonation.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
581,"2009-03-14",3.6,"On tap at Obriens. A very nice belgian ale. An Abbey Dubbel? Mild hops with malty plum sweetness. Yeast and bread dough with spice.","(San Diego) Santee, California, USA","padrefan98"
581,"2009-03-11",3.6,"On tap at OBriens. Copper color with lots of carbonation and a fizzy burnt-vanilla head. Aroma is light fruits with prominent grape and biscuit yeast tones. Simple, straightforward flavor of caramel malts with a touch of raisin and Belgian yeast on the end. Dry palate with no noticeable alcohol. As said, simple and one-dimensional, but definitely sessionable.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"
581,"2009-03-10",3.9,"On tap at Toronado: Poured to perfection in a snifter glass and had a tiny layer of foam while the beer itself was dark shade of copper. Aroma is bold and decked with hops and malt. Flavor is rich and bold with a strong citrus styled hop along with malty sweet grain. Finish is metallic and feels as though I could drink several glasses of this before I would wave the white flag.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"
581,"2009-03-05",3.7,"On tap at brewery. Copper brown wit almost no head. Sweet earthy hops aroma and taste with dry stone fruit notes and finishing fairly smooth. Very drinkable.","Berkeley, California, USA","badlizard"
581,"2009-03-01",3.4,"Shiny burnt and petrified amber, halo of tightly woven white head above.  Nose was piney yet smelled of belgian yeast as well with a hint of sweet ribbon candy.  Chalky belgian yeast esters, kinda freakin hoppy too all combining into a somewhat melted plastic taste.  Thats all I really get out of this beer...piney hops and belgian yeast...ugh...its clean enough and the yeast hops dont clash too much, but still..the combination is not my favorite","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
581,"2009-03-01",4.1,"On tap at the Drafting Room from my notes. 

The beer was presented in a pint glass, not in a chalis or tulip but this just meant that I got to have more Benediction to sample. Lucky me.

The color of the beer was a nice bright orange/amber color with a thin white head and slight lacing.

The aroma of this is excellent. From the first wiff you get the fruit tones as noted below, including banana and some plum and a bit of spice. It is worth taking in the aroma for awhile before you taste the beer.

The taste is even more impressive than the aroma. I get the banana and clove taste that others have stated they get. This is such a good dubbel that I had to have a few more. It is very drinkable as the sweetness and some hoppy backnotes mix well in your mouth and may for a very enjoyable drinking experience. Well done Russian River, well done.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, LUXEMBOURG","ggaughan"
581,"2009-02-23",3.6,"Tap @ Toronado San Diego, alongside a late afternoon brat.  Pours a rich reddish brown with a tan head.  Nose is sweet and quite rich.  Tase is sweet, rich, and slightly hoppy with a bitter bite, pretty tasty.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
581,"2009-02-23",3.5,"On tap @ Toronado San Diego.  Medium brown with a reddish tint.  Head was about 1 finger thick (off white) and left a touch of lacing.  Aromas of yeast, light hops and citrus fruits.  Finish was slightly sweet with a touch of hops and medium in body.","San Diego, California, USA","Snojerk321"
581,"2009-02-21",3.4,"ON tap.  Color was a auburnish with a creamy khaki head.  Aroma of flowers, citrus, yeast; pretty nice aroma.  Flavor was not quite as good.  Straightforward with bread, yeast, fruit, and flowers.  Ok.","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"
581,"2009-02-17",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 24, 2010 On tap at Russian River.  Not one of their best, but still a solid beer.  They called this a dubbel on the board - its sort of a cross between that and an American pale ale.  Amber-brown color with a light beige head.  Aroma is fruity with a little yeast, brown sugar, and hop bitterness.  Flavor is sweet malt, candi sugar, dried fruits, and west coast hoppiness on the finish.  Really is hoppy for the style.  Medium body for the style and appropriate carbonation level.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
581,"2009-02-15",3.5,"On tap at the brewpub. Clear amber orange with a one finger light beige head--creamy with a sheet of lacing sticking to the glass.  Fruity Belgian yeast up front with some notes of fig and candi sugar. Flavor adds the deeper malt character (almost roasty) and a hint of citrus zest.  Dry finish with bitterness peaking @ a 3 1/2--not quite a 4.  Strange that its as dry and bitter as it is--and the fact that there is really no sweetness in this beer.  Moderate carbonation with a light to medium body.  An OK Belgian-esque beer in its own right, but I think it got overattenuated and hopped with American hops--not a dubbel by any means.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
581,"2009-02-14",3.3,"tap at Toronado. Pours with a brown color.
Has some flavors of toffee and caramel and a bit of dried fruit. Aromas mainly of caramel and some yeast. Compared to some of the Belgian dubbels it is less exciting.","Bay Area, California, USA","HopheadHans"
581,"2009-02-13",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2009 Pours attractive brownish red with a finger thick light tan head. Sweet dried fruits and malt in the nose and flavor. Some toffee in there as well.","SF Bay Area, California, USA","AgentSteve"
581,"2009-02-11",3.5,"On tap at Toronado RR Night. This reddish brown ale poured with a thin beige head and a vinous aroma. There is a very delicate sour cherry flavor, which is just a bit too thin. Nevertheless, this is a tasty brew worth trying.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
581,"2007-02-13",3.7,"Bready orange and mango nose with notes of toffee and caramel. Soft and delicate body, with a clean and spicy finish.","manteca, California, USA","aspidites"
581,"2006-04-03",3.6,"The aroma was full of apples, light pear, bread, light malts, caramel, and light spice.  The beer poured a golden brownish orange color w/ very slight head and no lace.  The flavor was a light coriander, malt, apples and hints of citrus.  The mouthfeel was light to medium bodied and a little wet on the finish.  I found this on tap at the Liars Club.","San Diego, California, USA","Hairofthedog"

581,"2006-02-16",4.0,"Draught at the brewpub. Clear dark amber. Aroma of cocoa and cocktail cherries. Fairly dry and rather sofy with firm mouthfeel and above medium body. Light almond character. Rich flavours of orange and chocolate opens up when it warms, and the relative dryness makes them stand out. Salty finish.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
581,"2006-02-05",3.1,"Draught, at the breweryBurgundy colour.  Sweet and bubblegummy and raisiny.  A bit effervescent in the finish, which breaks up the rich sweetness.  Fairly complex for the style, low on the yeastiness but with a fairly estery aroma.  Not cloudy enough for me visually.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
581,"2006-01-27",3.9,"On tap at Liars Club in San Diego.  This one poured a gorgeous burnt amber color with ruddy highlights and a small beigy head that rapidly diminished to a film and a ring.  Aroma of apple, brown bread, a little grass adn herbs with banana as well.  Sweet and tart flavors, delicious fruity malts, woody notes from the oak again, coffee, yeastiness, brown sugar, a bit of an alcohol bite and an acidic finish.  Medium body, assertive carbonation.  Quite nice.","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"
