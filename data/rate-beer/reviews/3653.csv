Aroma brings out decadent bourbon barrels upfront, with lots of vanilla and molasses. Flavour is no less decadent, with loads of bourbon, vanilla, molasses and treacle. Sweet, but not cloying.

3653,"2016-11-13",3.4,"2015 vintage. Deep, warm brown colors with burgundy highlights. So much dark fruits in the aroma that its hard to pick up anything else. Tastes fruity as hell, too. A lot of raisins, plums, black grapes, figs, etc. Some herbs, molasses, licorice, oak, & vanilla in the far background. Booze stands out a lot at the end! Full body, sticky, low carbonation. Overall its good but somehow still disappointing. Expected much more balance & complexity but was just two-dimensional.","California, USA","beer_queue"
