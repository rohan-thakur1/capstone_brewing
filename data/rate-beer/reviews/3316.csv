3316,"2016-11-03",4.4,"It sounded like a cool idea to have a beer from a Chicago brewery that focuses almost exclusively on German Lager varieties. That was really the only basis I had for trying this beer, but man was it a choice that paid off. Heliostat pours golden. Theres a bit of haze, but not as much as the yeasty aroma would suggest. Bready sweet flavor followed by a medium amount of hop bitterness. Herbal, earthy, and mildly citrusy hop notes. The fresh, crisp finish is probably the sexiest thing about this beer. This brew is tasty and uncomplicated.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"
3316,"2016-09-11",3.5,"On tap at this years Chicago Beer Society picnic, and self dispensed to plastic showing a clear, golden hue, with a presentable layer of white head foam, and wavy spray as lacing. The nose presented a wisp of yeast, then soft grain/straw, with a subtle pils/lager scent. Light to medium bodied, with good carbonation, the taste added a hint of lemon, low, earthy bitterness, and a fairly crisp finish. Well suited for the occasion.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
3316,"2016-08-15",3.9,"Draught pint at the Olympic Tavern in Rockford, IL, August 10th. Very pale, bright gold with a lasting film of snowy head and thick lacing as the glass empties...huge cookie-malt nose, reminds me of gingerbread or ginger snaps, the spiciness is at first overwhelming and a bit odd I suppose, but I love it...eventually a more grassy spiciness shows up, thistle and hay, but it remains lovely and fresh, with a fine yeasty undertone throughout...ginger-cookie-bread is again evident on the tongue, with a judicious balance of pale malts and good ol fashioned noble hops, building towards a solidly bitter, largely dry finish...this is one of the most distinctive lagers Ive had recently; if I dont rate it extremely high it may be that the strong gingery character struck me as a little too odd; but I certainly will be trying it again, and my Summer of Zwickel continues to be very enjoyable.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

A bit hazy golden with a white head. Mild with grass, bread, citrus and some hints of yeast. Easy to drink. An ok one.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","gyllenbock"
3316,"2015-08-10",3.4,"Draft at GTMW. Hazy pale yellow color, medium white head. Aroma of lightly peppery hay. Taste is bitter, clean, crisp. Decent.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
3316,"2015-02-08",3.6,"On tap at fatpour. Well balanced, quaffable Lager. Good slightly roasted cereal flavor with light fruitiness. Little to no bitterness. Quite good.","Illinois, USA","drdisque"
3316,"2015-01-15",4.5,"This is an excellent lager and enormously better than most of Metropolitans regular offerings so even if you dont like those dont let that put you off trying this if you have the opportunity, esp. if you are a fan of this or similar styles. It is light bodied but not thin with crisp carbonation. This has everything you could want from this style a beer: firm but not harsh bitterness, solid malt character w/o being sweet, a lovely hop character and even a touch of a mineral note from the water. I keep forgetting Ive tried this and every time I come back to it I am shocked by how good it is. Definitely, this is one of the finest beers of its style and is a must for lager fans who are lucky enough to run across it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
3316,"2014-11-06",3.6,"Enjoyed on tap at Links Taproom in Chicago, IL. I didnt take tasting notes while enjoying this one, but remember this being a very good, albeit yeasty lager. Definitely enjoyable and easy drinking, would definitely have again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"

3316,"2014-09-09",3.5,"Helio - pours hazy lively yellow sunny hue. Good streaming carb, a dulled glow with cakey creamy white head. Good layer sticks, laces well. Aromas are fresh with bread dough, honeycomb, straw, apple and gentle pear. Yeasty life is a bit spicey, sone grape must, wet hay. Crusty bread, more grainy malts, cereal and dry straw. Initial is lighter end, distinct fruity bite meets bready and grainy malt, apple, melon, fresh dough. Middle shows a softened body, fruit as the backend quickly picks up with the spice, earthy bitterness, yeasty and dry qualities. A bit fizzy. Finish is dry, a bit bitter and earthy with some spicy life. Really runs through the gambit. Some twang, faint metallic touch in the finish. Fresh, fruity and pretty drinkable with tgat backend dry, bitter feel to keep it honest.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3316,"2014-09-02",3.8,"Draft. Pours gold, light haze, big white head. Excellent retention/lace. Aroma of grassy hop, lager yeast, bread. Taste is grassy, lightly sweet, yeast, grain. Palate is soft, slick, light bitter finish. This hit the spot after a long day.","Indiana, USA","tastybeer"
3316,"2014-08-30",3.6,"On tap at GTMW - Hooray! Zwickels! Pours golden with a foamy white head. nose is nutty herbal hops with tons of pale grain. Taste is lots of graininess, peanut butter, herbal hops. Smooth and well-carbonated. The peanut butter throws it off, but its still tasty. (and its a Zwickel!)","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
