2361,"2016-11-26",4.0,"4 week old can from a trade with a guy whos not on RB I think. Hazy dark amber-brownish color with creamy beige head. Aroma is piney, some tropical fruits, bready, a bit spicy malts. Aroma is still quite standard. Taste is huge starfruit, passionfruit, lots of juicy hops, only then some caramel malt base shines through. Light-bodied, maybe a bit too light even, but it has an oily texture. Medium carbonation. The aroma reminded me of, for instance, a 523 (which I usually get very fresh), but the flavour is so light-footed, fresh and lieblich, especially for this ABV. A real revelation!","Garching b.

2361,"2016-03-23",4.0,"Thanks Kelly Sullivan (untappd).
This was poured into a becher pint glass. 
The appearance had a dark burnt red color with a thin one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about thirty seconds leaving some messy lacing roaming all around the glass. 
The smell started off with a spectacular balance between the caramel / toffee / biscuity malts playing with citrus and slightly piney hops. 
The taste favors the malty sweetness just a tad more. Still, a nice bitterness roams in to partake in the flavor, yes, citrus/piney-ness. Nice balanced aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Carbonation seemed to run nice and low. Stickiness hits decently but not cloying. 
Overall, what a nice Amber/Red ale wonderfully balanced. Of course, Id have this again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
2361,"2016-03-14",4.3,"COD 12/11/15. Beautiful dark ruby pour with just a touch of cloudiness. Quite outstanding head volume, world class lacing and retention.

Outstanding nose of Florida citrus (lemon, lime, orange), a touch of mango and a very light herbal pine over a solid malt base with caramel notes.

Almost medium body that is quite smooth with a good amount of creaminess and a light oily character. Slightly above normal carbonation level with a bit of middle effervescence and a prickly finish.

A quite outstanding atypical flavor profile that really pushes sweet Florida citrus to the forefront while maintaining a light airiness to it. It begins with a lemon lime blend over a subtle sweetness that is slightly tart. This flows into a very mildly bittered middle with a mango sub note. Caramel makes it strongest showing as the bitterness begins to fade but is quickly replaced with a sub current that has leather and tobacco elements. The finish is a slow fade of orange rind bitterness. Complex and delicious.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

The aroma of the beer was well balanced between malts and hops, as I could smell grapefruit, mango, melon, toffee, and a touch of honey. The taste was quite IPA like, as there was an immediate rush of tropical fruit flavors on first sip, followed by a spicy hop flavor.

2361,"2015-11-28",3.7,"Beers that are red in color tend to be some of the most attractive and appealing beers out there. Yet, no one seems to agree on what exactly a red ale is; though most seem to be either an amber ale or an IPA that happens to red instead of golden, copper or orange. Cigar City Tocobaga Red Ale seems to be a little of both as it has the malty sweetness of an amber, but the strong hop profile of an IPA. Consider it a red IPA I suppose.

I poured a 12oz can into a red wine glass. It was canned on 10/1/15 and cost $2.49 ($0.21 per ounce). Thanks to Mike for this can!

Appearance: Magenta/maroon hue; very dark though plenty of murky sediment bits can be seen floating around. Pours to a thumb-width, tan, foamy head which laces and retains well.

Smell: Citrusy and floral hops for sure. Clean, bright, classic. Theres definite malt sweetness in the nose as well.

Taste: Theres a lot going on in this beer, and yet its also a bit simplistic. For a hop-forward brew its quite malty (I swear that sentence makes sense). Citrusy bitterness and flavor right away; especially that of ruby red grapefruit. But theres also a lovely sweetness thats difficult to ignore. Definitely the flavors commonly found in amber ale  caramel or toffee or treacle  though not cloyingly sweet. The bitterness is quite strong, which isnt surprising considering the 75 IBUs. Its also intensely dry and seems to absorb all the moisture out of the mouth after each swig. Alcohol is prominent as well and creates for a slight medicinal character; thankfully, its not all that annoying or distracting. Overall, the taste here is pretty nice.

Drinkability: At 7.2% ABV, Cigar City Tocobaga Red Ale is a pretty strong brew by most measurements. This creates for a bold palette, though the actual delivery is no burden whatsoever. Mouthfeel is thick with a slight sticky sensation to the texture. The alcohol imparts warmth and the hops do linger to dry out the tongue. Probably a good beer to stand up to savory food.

Mouthfeel: Medium creaminess with moderate carbonation.

Thanks to tastybeer for the gift. This was a very solid amber ale though at 7%+ ABV I think one was enough. Between the aggressive hops and other factors this was not your average grocery store beer to drink while cooking out at a tailgate party.

Aroma / Appearance - The warm red base looks like melted cherry cordials. Noble hops, fresh pine, and rose hips brighten the air like a hallway which has been polished and then walked over for a few hours.

Flavor / Palate - The warm fluid base hits the tongue with no subtlely at all. It hangs in the back of the throat like the water at the bottom of a vase once the flowers have wilted. This does get a bit heavy over time. Overall it is a world class amber ale worth drinking fresh.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The beer is russet brown, with orange to crimson highlights. The head is an inch thick, composed of dense, off white sea foam. The snifter is utterly caked with lacing. 

The aroma brings some nice hop character, along with a faint malt presence. The scent is reminiscent of many Cigar City brews I have had, with notes of dense smoke.

Great flavor and quite interesting. Not your ordinary red ale. The smoke and hop flavors are integrated elegantly. This beer is great for sipping or rapid consumption.

Pours a dark amber/chestnut brown color with burnt orange hues and a two finger yellowish beige head that slowly settles into a lasting ring.  Streaks of soapy lacing are left behind. 

Slightly smokey aroma with lots of  toasted oak and cedar along with light fruit, citrus and pale malt.  Hints of apple and other light fruit along with citrus rind, earthy, piney hops and pale biscuity malt.

Medium bodied but fuller than expected with a decent cedar presence up front that doesnt overpower the other flavors.  Lots of dry cedar/wood  countered by citrus/light fruit notes and biscuit malt.  Some of the humidor series beers are overly dry and taste like toothpick but the hop and malt flavors are still prominent in this one.  Some dry, resinous hop bitterness but not overdone with some citrus and light fruit character balancing things out.  Subtle pale malt with touches of biscuit and graham cracker.  Nicely done, well balanced beer with the cedar flavor subtly integrated.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Flavor is a bit of a disappointment.  I guess I should have seen it coming... One of Therese days Cigar City would not impress the pants off me... But why today?  Why not keep the romance alive for a little longer.  Anyhow, I digress. The flavor on this one is boozy...  Unapologetically boozy, from head to toe, start to finish, alpha to omega.  Kind of a burning medicinal edge of ethanol. There is a decent caramel malt presence and some of that citrus and resin hops profile, but they get buried by booze.

2361,"2012-02-26",4.3,"Very suprised I hadnt rated this before.  Smell its lots of rich character hops, NW variety, very fresh almost soapy quality to them.  Small amount of the red malt coming through on the nose.  Head is medium retention, very creamy and completely white, color is a dark reddish brown.  Really enjoying this beer.  Plenty of hop character, chewyness, medium body, drinks almost like a red IPA.  This seems to have gotten better since I have had it last.  Soft carbonation.  I do wish there was a little more of the malt body here.  finishes quite bitter.  All in all an excellent beer.  4/5","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","IPAsavedMYlife"

2361,"2012-02-14",3.2,"Lightly sweet, in-your-face west coast hop aroma - pine, froot and cat whizz. Cloudy, chestnut brown beer with a filmy off-white head.  Pathetic label. Nicely hopped, lightly sweet, dry toffee - the flavor was very interesting and had some notes that I couldnt quite put my finger on. Finishes off with prominent acidity, dry hops and  some off chemical tones..  You know, this style is really hobbled - it never quite develops the sophistication that an APA has, and its usually a bit too acidic and maybe even a little astringent.  That said, this particular instance seems to get around most of that, but Im glad I didnt buy a sixer.  Market Square Likkas, Timberlane.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"

Love the aroma, especially for an amber; grassy, citrusy hops, some caramel back, then more caramelly and the expected hint of tobacco later. Citrus hangs in throughout. Taste brings some pine, some resin, strong caramel but only mildly sweet, mostly dry with some pepper, some biscuits. Some roughness. Finishes quite dry and fairly short, with some bitterness as well. Very drinkable.

Aroma has lots of tropical fruit with a sharp sweet cotton candy and toffee malt character, some piney and grapefruit hop notes in the background. Flavors are a bit astringent in their bitterness and use of crystal malts, big pine, citrus, and melon hop notes that move towards an earthy quality as they attempt to dry out the finish.
Long bitterness throughout, and a healthy malt sweetness. Body is syrupy at times. Its not a bad beer as the hopping is nicely excessive but the use o crystal is just not my thing. This really reminds me of a smaller Bigfoot.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

2361,"2011-11-14",4.0,"The hazy reddish orange brew sits nicely in my Cigar City snifter with a nice sized white head on top.  It slowly disappears into the liquid and leaves a slight bit of lacing around the glass.

The nose bursts with citrus like hops.  A lot of grapefruit and orange in there.  Quite a moderate amount of malts in the nose as well.

Not much different in the taste.  The hops come at you first.  They are slightly earthy along with the citrus notes.  Id say there is even some tropical fruit tastes in there as well.  This has become common in their hoppy beers.  A caramel malt backing is present and gives some balance to things.  But the hops are first and foremost.","Boynton Beach, USA","MikeMoriendi"

Nose: green hops  pine trees and pine needs with the essence of forest. Crunchy underneath  crisp twigs and pine cones. Nondescript spices, thin apple crisps, and the musk of older forgotten times. Fir and pine meets sweet crunchies.

Palate: clean. Crunchy caramelized sweetness underneath while atop twigs, pine needles, fir trees, fall leaves mingle together. Apple skins in the back with more twigs and whole cinnamon sticks. Whole hop cones  sticky and parching. More hop cones and pine in the breath. Nicely attenuated.

2361,"2011-08-04",3.9,"Picked this bottle up at Connecticut Ave in DC. So happy that this is finally out in bottles, as Ive been looking for it ever since it was first released. Served in a Mikasa tulip.

Pours a dark blood-amber color with a two-finger off-white head and quite a bit of sticky lacing on the way down. Thin cap throughout. The nose carries a really nice burst of fresh citrus and pine with slight tropical notes. Underneath that is a bit of caramelized sugar and bready sweetness. Really quite nice and nails the description for a hoppy amber.

The flavor falls back a bit from there, as the hop flavor isnt as prevalent as the nose would lead you to believe. However, there are certainly still plenty of hops. Nice brown sugar and caramel sweetness plus backing malt. Medium body that is fairly chewy and has a bitter finish that is slightly dry. Good carbonation. Really, really solid effort all around.

2361,"2011-07-18",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 10, 2013 Poured from a 750ml bottle into a New Belgium globe.

Appearance: Pours a deep red-amber color with ruby highlights and a 2-3 finger frothy pale tan head. Excellent head retention and lacing.

Smell: Pineapple, coconut and pine with a touch of sweet malt. Smells a lot like their White Oak Aged Jai Alai.

Taste: Pine and bitter citrus up front followed by a hint of toasted malt in the middle before ending with another round of bitter hops at the finish. There are undertones of sweet citrus and coconut throughout. Aftertaste is bitter with just a light amount of sweetness that really balances it out. The aftertaste really lingers.

Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full-bodied with a high amount of carbonation. The hop oils are very sticky and really coat the palate.

Drinkability: Very high drinkability. I wish they offered this in 4 or 6 packs.

Overall: Excellent beer overall. Not your typical American Amber/Red Ale since it is so hoppy, but the category isnt too precisely defined in the first place. I would rank this among the best Cigar City beers that Ive had. Highly recommended.","Fort Myers, Florida, USA","adam42381"

Grapefruit, orange, and yes, jalapeño in the taste. Not the heat, but the floral qualities. Not bitter at all. Very well balanced and drinkable to no end. Great stuff.","Florida, USA","OmegaX"

2361,"2011-07-08",3.7,"750ml bottle.

Pours a dark hazy amber with a big creamy beige head that recedes pretty quickly to a thin collar and leaves really nice lacing.

Aroma is hoppy with some pine resin and lots of caramel malts and a bit of toasted bread.  There is a little bit of wood character as well, interesting nose for an amber.

Taste has a little more citrus than the nose, with some oranges and white grapefruit up front giving way to the caramel malts, bread and hints of sweet fruit.  Lightly bitter finish, roasty.

Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied for an amber and really creamy with strong carbonation.
