The flavour is quite bitter throughout with resin and grapefruit. Rye and malts peek through, but are overpowered.

Overall, this is a nice hoppy pale ale with rye notes. The nose is nice and fresh with big citrus and pine, and the rye adds a nice accent.

711,"2012-04-15",4.0,"On tap. Aroma just the way a juicy IPA should be: tropical, citrus, pine, cereal maltiness. Great sticky medium body. Sweet up front and sappy grapefruit tannic bitterness on the finish. Very well balanced. Delicious and chewy. I dont know specifically the effect the rye is having but this is one fabulous pale ale.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","herrbrown1974"
711,"2012-04-15",4.0,"On tap at Betty's. Appearance: cloudy amber, small snow white head. Aroma: delicious sharp hoppiness, nice fruit nose too with a malty backbone. Flavour: great big hop wallop, tons of 'em! So fruity and citrus like, very well balanced, wet hops tasted throughout with a deliciously hoppy finish. Great beer.","Dublin, IRELAND","garthicus"
711,"2012-04-14",4.1,"Tap at The Only Cafe. Pale amber-gold with a thick moussey head. The aroma is great - fresh pine and grapefruit with a touch of soft spiciness in the back. Aggressively hopped with a ton of fresh dank hoppiness over a lean pale malt/rye malt. Damn - I was not expecting this but now that I found it, I want more. Rich fresh hops. This reminds me if Bear Republics Hop Rod Rye mixed with Racer 5 (a combo I used to make when I had a steady free supply I both). Colour me impressed Camerons!","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
711,"2012-04-13",3.4,"Went into the brewery to buy a case of their Dopplebock. While I was there I chatted with a very nice employee (sorry forget his name) who told me about the launch of their new Rye Pale Ale. Was not yet on sale at the time but he said ""wait a minute"" and left for the brewery. He came back a minute later with a bottle of the RPA and said ""here...give it a try"". Great way to promote the beer!!! So here is the review... Colour -Pours a nice hazy amber colour with decent head. Aroma -an incredible nose and probably one of the best I have smelled in a very long time - spice and citrus mixed with the complexity of the hops but all very bold that seems to tickle the nose. The aroma says ""wow"". Taste -here is were I was a little disappointed and I suppose based on the aroma I was expecting ""wow"" in the taste and it just wasnt. Spicy/peppery rye was definately evident and the complex hops and malt gave it a spice aftertaste but a very smooth finish. OVERALL -a very good beer and one I would buy again but in my opinion not as good as the Dopplebock.","Ontario, CANADA","geord"
