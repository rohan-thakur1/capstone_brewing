The smell of the beer is good. It is a good porter smell. There are nice roasted malts in the front, containing aromas of chocolate, some licorice. It is nice. It contains a tiny acidic touch as well, maybe it is a fruity touch of the hops? There is a lovely bitterness to the smell aswel. Not bad.
The taste of the beer is pretty much the same as the smell. Nice bitter toasted malt, slightly savoury roast, liquorice, some caramel in the back. It is a bit stronger than the smell. It is in good balance. It contains a bit more liquorice flavours than most porters (at least, the ones Ive had). I like this one to.

Cant remember ever enjoying an Anchor beer and I dont expect that to change with this porter, but Ill keep trying. 

Poured a mahogany color with 3-to-4 fingers of khaki tan, frothy head. Average spotty lacing. Below average retention. (Sight - 3.50)

Smelled roasty malts, sticky toffee, spoiled dark plum, fig, raisins, hints of roasted nuts, dry chocolate, rough molasses, cocoa and unknown hops. Almost reminded me more of a dry stout. (Smell - 3.75)

Tasted better than the nose and more like a porter. Got roasty malts, bitter dry chocolate malt, dry cocoa, dark plum, raisins, hints of dark fig, charred molasses, toast, muted black coffee, dark toffee and unknown generic hops that you find in cheap-ass beer (thinking DieselPunk Porter). (Taste - 3.75)

Medium-to-full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, bitter finish. (Feel - 4.00)

Might have underrated this slightly overall, but just slightly. Maybe the best Anchor beer Ive had though. (Overall - 3.75)

Black beer with a smooth and appealing, frothy, pale tan head. The aroma smacks of prunes and as such isnt too appealing, although hints of nuts, damp earth and chocolate portend the complexity of the flavours to come. Indeed, its a varied roller-coaster on the palate, opening with dark fruit and berry notes, before yeasty marmite takes over, then bitter coffee and finally sweet, creamy chocolate and dairy flavours come in to round the taste off. Its very rich and very busy, with lots to like about it. However, a distinct and unpleasant vaguely rubbery off note runs through both its aroma and flavour characteristics, marring the overall score. A really hard beer to rate - Im hedging my bets.","Durham, ENGLAND","Hippoman"

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a deep-deep brown color with a nice thick cream colored head of one finger. The head has an amazing level of retention, very slowly fading over time to leave an amazing level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is sweet and roasty. The biggest smell is of a roasted malt mixed with notes of chocolate and coffee. The sweeter smells are of a molasses and caramel and a tiny bit of a wood and pine rounding it all out.

 Taste  The taste begins with a sweet molasses and caramel flavor with a good chocolate and roasted malt base. Some flavors of vanilla soon come to the tongue along with citrus hop as well as some other sweeter dark fruit flavors. A very light coffee and some nut come to the tongue more toward the end of the taste, combining with the rest and a newly encountered floral hop, which overall produce a nice roasty, sweet and lightly hopped flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  For a porter the body of the beer is on the average to slightly thinner side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the average side. The carbonation balances the porter characteristics of the beer with the hop very well, but a thicker body may have been slightly more appropriate. Even with that said, overall the feel was pretty good.

 Overall  A rather tasty and slightly higher hopped porter. A nice take on a porter.","","Darkmagus82"

It coats the glass as I tip it to my mouth and leaves thick splotchy lace patters behind. The nose is malty sweet and roasty with caramel, toffee, bready and light toasted bread notes with a hint of chocolate. Its sweet up front with lots of deep malty texture in a full body. Roasted grain, toasted bready notes, caramel and toffee blend with mild bitterness from the mostly hidden hops and finish a little dryer but still with some residual sugary sweetness.

A - Pours deep, dark, brown; bordering on black; with a small half finger tall tan head leaving spotty lacing down the glass.


S - Smells of dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, toffee, and a hint of earthy hops. Simple yet complex.


T - Starts off with some chocolaty sweetness quickly giving way to a mix of dark roasted malt, lightly roasted coffee, toffee, and some earthy hops. It is sweet but not to the point of being overpowering. The finish is mostly dark roast, lingering for some time.


M - Medium-Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Roasty feel with plenty of it lingering through the finish.

ODCZUCIA : piwo jest z górnej półki. Trudno, przy tak malej zawartości alkoholu wydobyć tyle bogactwa. Coś pomiędzy Guinness FES a Rochefort 10. Naprawdę zaskakujące. Brawo dla piwowarów z Anchor.

175,"2014-03-01",4.0,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours a very dark ruby color. A shit ton of head is formed - its three fingers high, and light tan in shade. Its also pretty long lasting, with a rocky texture and some great lacing left behind.

S: Theres actually a lot going on here. The very first thing I notice is some plummy dark fruits and some chocolate. Backing that is a healthy yet subtle hop note. And theres also a decent amount of caramel, toffee, and brown sugar. Its not the biggest nose ever, but who cares? Its contemplative and inviting nonetheless.

T: The very first sip is chocolaty. The second sip is fruitier in tone yet with a hoppy finish. The third sip sees the hops mingle with the subtle roast to create a great coffee flavor. Some licorice flavors also appear. Its not suffocatingly complex; rather all the flavors are quite defined and readily noticeable...making its delicate balance all the more impressive.

M: Drinkability is the key here: its light in body and dry on the back end, with only a touch of lingering sweetness. Carbonation is actually pretty low, allowing said sweetness to appear.

O: This is probably the best robust (hoppy) porter Ive had. Everythings in good balance, yet the flavors stand out quite well. I could see this becoming a go-to porter.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

175,"2013-10-05",3.7,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a nonic pint glass. It was bottled in 2/21/13 and cost $2.75 ($0.23 per ounce).

Appearance: Opaque black body with no visible carbonation. Pours to a large, tan, frothy head which laces and retains extremely well.

Smell: Typical porter aroma of dark malts and toffee sweetness. Slightly tangy.

Taste: Theres something bittersweet about drinking a traditional porter from a traditional brewery. Anchor Porter epitomizes the style, which makes it good in that its familiar. Though its also quite familiar, almost cliché (if that term could ever apply to beer). Its sweet, but not overbearing and highly drinkable. If you want a good porter, you get that here.

The bottle I was drinking was relatively old, which probably could have been avoided had the brewery used an easier-to-read bottling date instead of a code. I did detect some tanginess to the palette, though it seemed to accentuate some of the notes. It begins with an English-like taste with hints of fruit, but mostly dark, toasted malt. Theres significant bitterness through the middle with a distinct peanut brittle-like flavor all throughout the back end. Its slightly tangy or sour, though it works with the beers natural flavors of roasted peanuts and toffee. Nothing in the way of chocolate or coffee, though, which is fine. It leaves a slightly dry aftertaste, but its easily tolerable. Either way, its a by-the-book porter: no frills; but nothing off, either. 

Drinkability: What separates porters from stouts is their drinkability, and Anchor Porter is a good example of that. The mouthfeel is soft, smooth and comfortable. Though slightly thin, consistent carbonation is noticeable. Its easy to drink in large swigs or small sips. At 5.6% ABV its got enough body to satisfy and work well as a standalone beverage, though a bit too heavy to session.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

175,"2013-10-04",2.8,"UPDATED: APR 8, 2014 Bottle: Pitch black, volatile brew with a big and fluffy tan head thats fairly quick to settle to a thin film. Aroma is huge roasted malt, slight hints of chocolate, and some deep grape and fig sweetness - almost a wine-like fruitiness, covered by intense amounts of roast. Taste is incredibly roasted as well; unsweetened coffee, dark cocoa, enormous barley flavors - toasted and dark. Some sweet dark fruit up front that transitions into roasty-bitter. Hops are faintly present, leafy and ashy. Mouth feel is almost creamy but a little thin for the style. Well made perhaps, just not exactly in my wheelhouse.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

175,"2013-09-24",4.3,"Aromas agradables e interesantes, se perciben notas dulces las cuales desprenden notas a caramelo y principalmente chocolate, ligeramente vainilla. Muy agradable.

Su apariencia es la que cualquier cerveza que se haga llamar porter debería tener. Color obscuro, casi negro. Carbonatación de media a baja. Cuerpo medio, cremosidad excelente. Corona abundante de retención media. Simplemente espectacular.

En boca agradable y sabrosa. Ligera, pero a la vez sumamente cremosa. Elegante sin llegar a espantar el paladar. Chocolate y café a cada momento.

Al paladar considero que cumple ampliamente su cometido. La cremosidad y sabores a malta tostada destacan. Un ligero amargor se percibe en garganta, sin embargo en ningún momento es agresivo. Tampoco llega a percibirse empalagos a pesar de su sabrosa cremosidad. Quizá el único aspecto que no hace convencer al 100% es un muy ligero sabor acido en garganta el cual o debería existir, pero que llega a confundirse con un ligero amargor. Muy grata después de todo.

En general una cerveza muy buena, que cumple con las características de una buena Stout y que definitivamente volveré a adquirir cuando la vuelva a ver.

The aroma was of a roasted bread malt, mild resin hops and an earthy yeast with notes of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, toffee, dark fruit (figs) and a whiff of smoke.

The taste was lightly sweet with a bold malty roastiness and hints of toffee and chocolate in the beginning, becoming much bitterer with a large coffee presence, a mild fruitiness and had a hoppy smoky finish. The flavor hung on for a nice long time proceeding the swallow, with a bitter roasty smoky taste left behind to linger on the taste buds for a while longer.

Mouthfeel was just a tad under medium in body with a dry, oily texture and a surprisingly fizzy carbonation.

smell: Roasted malts. Rye bread with caramel sweetness and a faint licorice finish in the nose.

taste: I get rye bread right away with some caramel sweetness and banana. This mellows out to into a mild licorice bitter with figs. Theres some coffee and roasted malts bitterness too, but faint for a porter. Theres also some lemon in the background, balancing the sweetness out.

mouthfeel: Creamy feel, milky with quite a carbonation kick. Not very strong, but does linger quite long. 

overall: This must be my favorite porter ive had so far. I love the easy going mellowness of this one without getting too thin, milky of watery. Usually porters are all about coffee and chocolate bitterness, but i love the sweet rye base flavor of this one together with the more subtle usual porter flavors. It gives more body and balance to it then any other porter ive had (quite a lot). So for me this one is the benchmark right now :) Highly recommended!","NETHERLANDS","Xstream"

Alright, my cold has subsided and my palate is back for the most part. Ive got some editing to do though so this is going to be a bit rushed. Luckily this isnt my first time having Anchor Porter.

A: Creamy head with near black body. Perhaps a very slight reddish tint. Think darkly stained wood as opposed to nasty maroon mini-van.

S: Sweet. Straight up cane sugar and sawdust (the yummy kind of sawdust).  I really cant smell any of the bitter cocoa/coffee/smokiness that is common in the modern porter.

T: Medium-full body. Smokey and creamy but NOT overly syrupy. Balanced carbonation and sweetness with a dirty tinge at the back of the tongue with somewhat of a tangy aftertaste. Hipters beware, this is a beer that tastes good.

Overall: Full disclosure here: This is pretty much my go-to beer when it comes to friendly Denton shindigs when I want to lay low, have fun and not pretend like Im cool or something.  Its affordable but its not Budweiser, its drinkable but its not Shiner Bock, and its interesting but its not Banana Bread Beer. I appreciate moderation in almost everything in lifeincluding my beer.  Anchor Porter is the Ron Paul of beer. On that note, vote for Ron Paul.","Texas, USA","michaelkraus"

Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a thick tan head that lingers forever. Awesome lacing on the sides of the glass too.

Aroma of heavily roasted malt, espresso, and dark fruit. A little fruitiness from the hops is there too. 

A lot of roast comes through in the flavor along with a soft sweetness. Some chocolate and caramel along with a lot of dark fruit. Much more fruit in the taste than in the nose. The bitterness is moderate but it helps to balance out the sweetness. Fairly full mouthfeel.

Overall, this is an amazing porter. All the right components are there with nothing really being too overpowering. This would be a great beer in the winter and it is light enough to have a few of in a sitting.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

175,"2012-06-22",2.8,"Wow, thats a bit of a shock. Not at all what I would expect from a porter. Far from unpleasant, but at the most, its interesting. Perhaps a little too thin and fruity, with a dry sourness and a strange, resinous, almost flowery San Francisco tingle. The beer keeps biting the palate for a while. They say the Anchor Porter was the first modern American porter, and we gotta give a lot of credit to the history and resilience of Anchor Brewing. And what do I know about American porters or the West Coast? Its probably all part of that California attitude. I must say that from a distance, it looks fabulous, the first sip is disappointing, but the flavours do wrap up much better by the middle of the glass. Nothing wrong to say its an acquired taste. If I have a second one, I could even get something going with this Anchor Porter.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"

Palate: Moderate carbonation, smooth and creamy body, very dry finish.

Overall: Dry and somewhat bitter Porter that surprisingly did not overdo the roasted character to accomplish that feat. Just a very smooth, complex and drinkable Porter.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

175,"2011-04-27",4.3,"Anchor Porter: Drank out of Sam Adams glass
Pour: It pours an almost black color but with a reddish color around the bottom where just a little bit of light shines through. The carbonation doesnt seem to be too high but it is hard to tell due to the darkness of the beer. The beer has a massive three finger head with creamy consistency on top but a soapy consistency on bottom. The head seems to linger a pretty long while.
Aroma: Chocolate is the forefront aroma with a backbone of roasted malts. I dont really get any alcohol smell which boosts my optimism for tasting this beer. 
First taste: Although chocolate is the most pronounced note in the aroma the roasted malted barley is the main taste. The chocolate provides a nice accent to the malts but what really gives this drink its unique flavor is the combination of barley and hops. It has a nice refreshing flavor with somewhat of a thin slippery mouth feel to it. There is a nice quaint bittersweet finish to it that seem to end abruptly only to be replaced by a more barley flavor.
Overall: The anchor porter is a really nice tasteful refreshing brew that I did enjoy greatly. It is a beer that brings foreword the sometimes over shadowed barley characteristics. I would give this beer a rating of excellent.","Texas, USA","adayale"

175,"2011-04-22",4.0,"355ml bottle.
Pours a very dark reddish brown/black, with a firm brown head.
On the nose there is a clear element of roasted malts - chocolate, coffee, tar, etc - and notes of vanilla, spices, hops and sweet licorice.
The palate is medium to full bodied, with some residual sweetness, quite thick, and medium bitterness.
Flavourwise, again loads of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, licorice, vanilla, hops.
It finishes quite bitter and roasted, and the sweetness gets almost a tad cloying (but, hey, Im getting picky here), and it ends on a quite astringent, ashy note. On the other hand, the sweetness helps to wrap the somewhat robust roasted notes into a velvety coating, which increases the drinkability like h*ll.

Pour yields a very dark brown-colored brew with a really nice tan head and quite a bit of lacing. Solid retention as well. The nose brings forward some light chocolate and roast. There is also a bit of toffee and caramel lingering in the background. The taste is similar, leaning more toward the chocolate with a bit of malt sweetness. Body is too thin and undercarbonated.

Porter létére eléggé itatja magát, köszönhetően az erősebb komlózottságnak, és nem is annyira testes. Lecsengése száraz és kesernyés, és eléggé hosszan tartó, jellegzetes utóíze van.

175,"2010-12-26",3.6,"12 oz bottle.  Pours an almost opaque black color with a small amount of tan head.  The head dissipates quickly but there is a fair amount of lacing.  Aroma is not as strong as one would expect.  Aroma is mostly of roasted malts with some fruitiness.  Flavor is mostly malty with some hints of chocolate and coffee.  Some sweetness at the beginning.  The finish is slightly bitter as some hops character emerges.  Body is medium with minimal carbonation.  This is a good beer and is drinkable and a probable repurchase.  What sets it back is that it is a bit too simple for my tastes.  It doesnt quite have the complexity of flavor I want in an elite porter.  Its missing that extra kick.  Definitely well balanced.","New Haven, Connecticut, USA","moocow9386"

Aroma - fruity, dark malt, with a wee bit of hops in the background. Smells British.
Appearance - Black with a tiny bit of blood red in the center. Bubbly white foam head than retreats to the sides of the glass.
Taste - A lot of the fruitiness found in a British porter up front. The middle is where the dark malt sweetness comes in. Bittersweet chocolate flavors for sure. Finishes roasty with a slight sour tartness.
Palate - medium bodied with a very appropriate light carbonation.
Overall - one of my favorite porters. Definitely more a nod to the British side of the style, but with a definite American slant. Amazing porter!","Cerritos, California, USA","Fatalstrike"

Ar: The aroma seems a bit deadened to me, but whats here is pretty nice (roasted coffee).
Ap: This is a really pretty beer.  Pours a deep black with just a hint of red shining through when held to the light.  1"" cinnamon head of tightly knit bubbles lasts long enough to enjoy.
T: Of course the big roast coffee note is present, but there are some black licorice and chocolate undertones that are quite nice.

175,"2010-10-30",4.5,"Full, lush, creamy, cream colored head.  Color is almost pitch black.  Just the faintest dark red, ruby highlights around the edges.  This brew looks outstanding.  The head is really sticking around and it leaves a copious amount of lacing.  A rich chocolate and coffee malt come to the forefront of the nose.  The smell is also evoking a roasted and smokey flavor that is very delightful.  The taste is very similar to the smell by recalling the chocolate and coffee.  Not overly sweet, but just enough sweetness for a teasing.  The smokey flavor adds appeal by appearing in a delicate way in the end.  Medium to full mouthfeel.  Chewy and very smooth.  Creamy.  The coating of the tongue and throat are very satisfying as they linger for a long while.  I really, really, really like this brew.  I havent had a tremendous amount of Porters in my life, but this one has to be at the top of my list of ones I have had thus far.  Perfect for those late Autumn/Winter days and evenings.

175,"2010-10-26",4.0,"12 oz bottle into English pint. I cant believe I havent rated this yet; its always been one of my favorites. Pours an almost impervious black with reddish tints showing up when held up to a light. Has a nice long retaining tan head that leaves exceptional lace. Aroma is very English compared to most American porters. Smells like a bakery: freshly baked cookies and bread especially; cocoa, cinnamon. Taste is both tart and sweet with some  bitterness coming up in the finish. Tastes somewhat old. If Im reading the code right, this was brewed in September of 2009. So it is past its prime, which is a damn shame, because I remember this being a very delicious, distinctive beer. Its still good, but that old taste is definitely bringing the score down. Ill definitely rerank it as soon as a fresher bottle becomes available. Carbonation is low to medium, body is medium, texture is a little chalky. This beer deserves better, so maybe I fudged a little on the scores.

A - Dark garnet color with a large, foamy, thick, creamy tan head. Good retention that sticks around for awhile. Leaves a nice layer of lace.

S - Sweet malt with cocoa and some anise (along with some raisin) aroma gives it a chocolaty and tart aroma. Slightly roasted malt with some caramel. Could be a little stronger, but pretty good.

T - Similar to the nose with chocolate, some anise, and some raisin come out along with the roasted, sweet, caramel malt. Some earthy and nutty flavors come out along with a touch of spiciness. Hints of coffee, but fairly faint. Very nice mix of flavors and pretty well balanced.

M - Fuller side of medium body with a good level of carbonation. Pretty smooth and creamy. Just gets a touch of a drying feel at the end.

D - Very easy to drink porter with a nice mix of flavors that is well balanced. Keeps me wanting to drink more.

175,"2010-04-18",3.8,"12oz bottle, purchased from Whole Foods? Pours a deep, dark brown color; significant, foamy, textured, small-bubbled light-tan head with great retention and lacing; gorgeous pour on this. Hugely charismatic malt character in the aroma, but also a minimal yeast fruitiness that suggests very low, lager-like fermentations (that seems on par for Anchor, though I dont know all that much about their brewing techniques across their entire lineup): creamy nougat, toffee, non-bitter chocolate, and caramel, with a significant melanoidin contribution, it seems, with a very light hop presence and a very clean yeast character; clean, well-developed maltiness, and a touch of dark fruits in the nose. Medium to medium-full body; average levels of carbonation; creamy, and entirely non-astringent despite the heavy contributions from darker specialty malts; very smooth in the mouth; there is a significant bittering quality here, suggestive of minerals and mint that hints at the Northern Brewer hops used in Anchor Steam: not resiny or dank, but pleasantly expressed; following the nose, the maltiness is lovely and well-grown: toffee, caramel, and a melanoidin bock-like presence, coupled to the darker chocolate (non-bitter) and very light roasted qualities; the yeast is generally clean, perhaps contributing a touch of red apple, but again I think low fermentation temps. really keep the yeast contributions in check; overall, a creamy, impressively rich porter that I greatly enjoy but doesnt (ultimately) take me to that 4.0+ range; but lovely anyway.

175,"2010-04-10",4.1,"Bottle, home.  Excellent porter, one of my favorite hometown beers.  Anchor Porter pours a very dark shade of brownish ruby, nice highlights in the light, transparent but for the color.  The head is big and creamy.  The aroma is a mix of chocolate, coffee, roast, plums, molasses, mild booze, some porter ashiness, dates, blackberries, toasted granola.  The flavor is smooth and rich.  Its intense for the abv with a lot of roast, dark fruits and brown sugar/molasses/caramel.  The hops give just enough bite to reign things in.

Well, here goes the sip. As I imagined. Anchor uses this same kind of hop for their Christmas Ale, and for that very reason I detest this seasonal from Anchor. In this porter, it is more hidden and blended into the usual coffee and licorice, but nevertheless present enough for me to repel. Only to a certain extent, though; Anchor Porter has a decent mouthfeel and is fairly drinkable. I guess I just cant handle that particular kind of hop.

175,"2010-02-07",4.3,"Poured from 16 oz bottle into nonic pint. 

Appearance: Strong coffee black color with a hint of clarity at the very edge. Thick, rich, caramel colored head that leaves heavy lacing on the sides of the glass.

Smell: Fragrance of rum, dates, and some yeast. However, it most strongly smells of molasses.

Taste: There is a strong backbone of what tastes like Steens Pure Cane syrup or molasses in this one. Its sweet, but there are enough hops to really make it balanced. Not cloying at all. Some roasted/smoky character slips into the background too. 

Mouthfeel: Bold, frothy carbonation that goes down without being too thick. Medium feel to it. 

Drinkability: Not overly strong or thick. Thin enough to guzzle, but thick enough to sip. Quite a tasty porter.","Louisiana, USA","jovy1097"

175,"2009-11-20",4.0,"33cl bottle, as shown.

Pours a pitch black with a big, creamy beige head. Impressive retention, plenty of lacing. Great-looking porter.

Sweet aroma of double chocolate, with a subdued coffee note and even a whiff of hops lurking in the background.

For a porter, this one is medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation. Smooth, creamy mouth feel. 

Initially sweet taste of caramelised malt and aniseed, but towards the middle a healthy, smoky bitterness kicks in and carries this brew towards its dry, refreshing finish. Lingering, but smooth, alcoholic after taste. 

This is a most pleasurable American porter from Anchor, a classic, I am told, of its kind. While of the porter beers I know Id slightly favour Fullers London Porter and Samuel Smiths Taddy Porter, this one comes pretty close.

175,"2009-09-02",3.6,"The initial sweet dark fruit reminds me much more of a baltic porter than a porter, which makes me wonder where the flavor is coming from here. With baltics a part of that is of course the high alcohol. This is a low alcohol session beer. I am not sure this porter is to my taste, to my mind the platonic archetype of a porter is Founders Porter, which is creamier, roastier. 
I will give the anchor this though, its gorgeous. 
This just reminds me that I really need to rate Founders, because this just doesnt hold a candle.","California, USA","tekhna"

Every sip had this minor undertone of biting bitterness that just didnt go away.  It was very noticeable compared with most other porters that Ive tried.  Still, it is an excellent beer and I would gladly drink the others five in the fridge!","Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","dagimp"

Actually tastes a bit like Anchor Steam, which is a little odd for a porter.
UPDATE: Tried this again at the brewery and its actually not bad at all.  Must have been dirty tap lines or something last time.  Still has that Anchor Steam taste to it that sort of dulls the flavors.  Must be their yeast.

175,"2008-11-20",4.4,"Pours almost black with a nice foamy tan head. The retention and lacing is excellent.

The smell is of roasted malt, brown sugar, and hops.

The taste is initially of roasted malt with the subtle presence of hops. After washing over the tongue a few times, the brown sugar comes through (especially as it warms) and all the tastes blend into a nice bittersweet finish.

The mouthfeel is on the light side for what I would expect form a porter, but this is not necessarily a negative. Carbonation is balanced and lends to the brew’s crispness.

This is a very easy drinking porter. I would take delight in having several of these in a sitting (though I don’t normally like to do that). The bittersweetness of this brew makes up for any loss in complexity. This is a great straight-up porter and I think it will become a regular for me.

175,"2008-08-28",3.7,"I had my first two Anchor Brewing beers while in Texas on a sort for Borders, and they were the classic Steam Beer and Liberty Ale. But up until yesterday, I had yet to partake of their Porter. Thankfully that travesty of my life is now over and I can consider myself an enlightened Anchor Porter fool.

My Anchor Porter poured a thick blackish brown with very little room left for light. Holding it up to a lamp, only faint hints of amber can be seen along the bottom of the glass. a minimum two finger head of soft cappuccino tinged foam tops off my glass, lingering for at least a couple minutes, leaving masses trails of brussels lace as her soft depths slowly retreated into my brew. Her nose is brimming with creamy milk chocolate notes, hints of licorice, dark malts, and vanilla. A quaff later and my tastebuds are reveling in a pleasantly light body with mild weight. Its certainly not as light as a lager, but not nearly as heavy as some porters I have enjoyed. She is smooth, balanced, and more than happy to show off her lush body resplendent in chocolate and café latte notes, vanilla nips, and a lingering bit of bitterness in the finish do to either the richly roasted malts, hops, or both. The tinge of lemon zest I was trying to pin down in the nose is the hop backbone that keeps Anchor Porter from being overly sweet and giving her a nice crisp dry finish. Each quaff leaves a trail of brussels lace all the way to the last which was a bitter-sweet moment.

At certain times I was almost reminded of a milk stout do to Anchor Porter’s lush creamy milk chocolate latte palate. But overall, she shined as a porter through and through.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Medium bodied to light bodied on the palate; a bit watery and should be thicker in my opinion.  Little to no carbonation.  Overall:  Nice to have an original beer in a certain style every now and then, and this does it for porters.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown that was black in the glass with slight red highlights and an average, tan head. The aroma was moderate to heavy roasted, chocolate (like hot cocoa mix and chocolate syrup) malts and very light hops. The initial flavor was lightly sweet and lightly to moderately acidic; while the finish was moderately to heavily sweet and lightly biter with an average duration. The flavor was mostly roasted malt with a little bit of bitter chocolate and just a hint of hops in the finish.

The mocha head laces prodigiously until it settles down to a wispy film for the last half pint. The aroma of rich roasted caramel malts is paired with a herbal hoppiness and figs. The initial taste again reveals the caramel, but this is soon cut into by the leafy hops, which lend a pleasant bitterness to this drink. In fact, this is probably the only porter Ive had where the hops have been given this prominence. Adding to this the melange of well-meshed traditional porter flavours of roasted malts, chocolate and mild coffee, and you have a winner. The mouthfeel is smooth, with perfect carbonation for the flavour. Dangerously drinkable.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Bobsy"

Creamy, bubbly dark tan head that is mostly lasting, and leaves a thick layer of foam. Spotty drip lacing. Dark vinous fruits, raisins, figs, tobacco, chocolate and molasses. Also get a sense of boozy soaked fruit bread or something similar. Also  a bit of a sour twang, presumably from the hops. My only complaint is I wish the aroma was a little more up front, but thats a small nitpick. Tons of roasted and charred malts on the fore, then segueing into sweet malts and chocolate, and a healthy dose of molasses. Sugary sweetness at the very end of the swallow, along with some ripe dark fruits. Very smooth, lightly creamy mouthfeel. Medium astringency, but very easily drinkable.

The roasted/slightly burnt notes in the flavour were a complete surprise to me, but they give way to more chocolate, fruit and general malty deliciousness.

Im talkin much sweeter than excpected.. toasted black malts and mild smoke emerge toward the back.  Flavor was again driven by powerful sweetness.. roasted bakers chocolate and cocoa again at the core.. tasty chocolates.. moderate herbal and woody bitter accents.. left an almost burnt cocoa impression at the finish.

175,"2007-04-25",4.4,"Bottle, pours dark brown with a huge light brown creamy head.  The head shrinks down a little but sticks around for the whole beer, and the lacing is pretty good.  The aroma is heavy on the malt side.  The aroma is of chocolate and coffee.  There is not much hop aroma.  There is also a hint of sourness to the aroma.  Takeing the first sip you are hit with a pretty good size malt bill, with quite a bit of coffee and chocolate.  There is also a distinct sourness to it.  There is a slight bitterness, but not much for hop flavor.  With the initial flavor it is very sweet with light bitterness.  Then the finishing flavors the sweetness falls back to the moderate level with a little bit of bitterness and that sourness.  The duration of the finish is somewhere inbetween short and average length.  The body is medium with a creamy texture and soft carbonation.","Hamilton, Michigan, USA","biggenius29"

The aroma is faint, with only an earthy hint of chocolate and smoke.  The taste is somewhat peculiar, being slightly watery and tasteless towards the beginning, and fading into a toffee and coffee ending with a decent hops and malt balance.  The best part of this porter is the palate, which consists of a very silky mouthfeel with little astringency.

The beer is semi-thick, and goes down very smooth! It has a very sweet caramel/dark fruit smell to it. After I had a few gulps I noticed the smell does not do the flavor justice. The beer provides coffee, chocolate, and smoke notes. I love this beer because it keeps me guessing. The ONLY reason this beer did not get a 4+ is because of the weak alcohol content. I am disappointed because I like to feel the beer take a bite of my throat while drinking it. The St. Bernardus Abt 12 has this quality. The flavors come out, but then the alcohol gives you a slight zing at the end. The bottles are cool too.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

Aroma is very nice, attractive to the beer drinking nose. Chocolate root beer?  Dark tan head that is barely there except for a froth and ring.  Good strong bitter porter stout flavor impact.  Thick and almost syrupy on the tongue. Burned western pine flavors impact the uvula.  Metalic aromas slowly infringe on the olfactories. Seems to have a higher alky content if you observe by flavor. Black coffee bitterness is apparent. Barely any carbonation. Finishes with the intent that you will not forget. A stronger porter. A little more ver busto  than I expected from a gentlemans porter. Plenty good for a west coast beer. If it was not for the bitter linger, I would say this is much like a sweet stout.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

175,"2007-04-02",4.5,"Anchor Brewing has always been a favorite of mine. Going back when I first stared with their Liberty Ale and working my way up to Old Foghorn. Itd been awhile since I cracked open an Anchor Porter so I thought Id give it a go. Pours out a rich, creamy thick tanish/brown head which stayed the course while drinking. Color of the beer is a deep chocolate brown color, with some light bubbles sticking to the sides. Flavor is dark chocolate, some roasted coffee, molasses and toffee. Flavors were more of the same with the nose but an added hop profile to keep it lively and interesting. This is an excellent example of what a porter can be. Drinkable, rich, smooth, and not overbearing in anyway. A near masterpiece from a phenomenal brewery.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

The nose is strong with roast and chocolate malt, sweet, with some relatively liberal floral hops and some creaminess.  The palate is creamy and smooth, with subdued carbonation and a tiny bit of stickiness holding it together, I like it.  The flavors are in line with the aroma, big sweet characteristically porter chocolate malt and characteristically stout roast.  Creamy and sweet, with a bit of a acidic charcoal aspect.  The finish is creamy and smooth then the charcoal acidity and the floral hops kick in.  A little bit of diacetyl noticable with the warming, though its not out of place.

Cola brown body, full-sized cheesy khaki head. Bready aroma and actually comes off lightly spiced, as of gingerbread(??). Unspecified dark malts. Still very tasty. The Dr Pepper and cola flavors that were so outspoken when fresh have receded to a second-long impression and have given way to the darker roastier flavors. Which isnt to say this is at all roasty in the way that stouts are. Deft-bodied and very drinkable, which is just how I like my porters. Retronasal - whole espresso bean oils. Overall, it seems this will hold up for a long time.


Near black body, mocha tan head. Roasty nutty aroma. Well balanced flavor, a little mocha sweetness, a little roasty bitterness, a little smoky and a tiny bit acidic. A little underwhelming at first but a few bottles later and its starting to grow on me.

175,"2007-02-10",5.0,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2007 Anchor Porter is not just great, but something that brewers should take note of, a prime example of why craft brewing in America is as great as it is.

When you look at the bottle, it appears frivolously austere, serious but unorthodox. The label appears to be from a generation ago, which invites you to taste a brew from a time when craft beer was the only beer available.

The porter is rich tasting, with subtle hints of chocolate and strongly roasted malted barley flavor. It is slightly carbonated with just a dash of sweetness; pouring a creamy beige head and hints of bitterness. It is solid and noble, just as the bottle shows.

Anchor Porter is the kind of beer you see on a menu at a neighborhood restaurant and recommend to friend who is looking for something other than Guinness.","http://westchesterbeer.com, USA","DeadGuyFrank"

Appearance is of a dark, nearly opauque reddish brown with a dark tan head.  Also, this product comes in the unique Anchor bottle.

The aroma of Anchor Porter is of caramel and sweet alcohol (not hop) esters.  It is a pleasant smelling product.

Taste is of chocolate with a definite alcohol component which is not at all unpleasant.  There is a slightly sour malt taste which accompanies the lingering alcohol taste.

Damn Bevmo in Mission Valley is a crappy store.  Nothing else worth a damn.......but, I digress.........So, this beer smells amazingly good.  The head is really quite nice.....very tan, with tons of lacing.  Surprisingly, this one tastes alot like a traditional british porter, or at the very least much more ""european"" than I am used to.

Very chocolatey nose, as a creamy chocolate sauce for desserts; hints of tobacco, very lightly smoked and faraway C-hops. Powerful and delicate at the same time, balanced. Dry, smokey flavour with more tobacco and even ashes than the chocolate from the nose. Again just this suspicion of noble USA-hops. Gradually filling in with a discreet acidity from roasted barly and smoked grains, and the essence of unsweetened cappucino. Again wonderful balance. Not rich as a stout, but dry enough, and velvety. Again: excellent balance. Long lingering coffeeish-tobacco aftertaste. Very good porter.

175,"2006-09-02",4.2,"Presentation: This beer comes in a very unique short stubby bottle. A good addition for bottle collectors.


Appearance: This beer pours motor oil back, with a slight red hue (maybe mahogany). Looks black as it sit in my beer stein. Huge 3 finger muddy brown head, very thick. Nice lacing. 


Smell: I got little out of the smell. It was not very aromatic, but after searching I did find a bit of burnt chocolate, toffee and a distinct toastedness to it.

Taste: Sweet smooth malts and maple syrup. It had a bit of red to the malts (whatever that means). The aftertaste had a bit of green floral hops that left a slight bitter taste on the tip of your tongue. Overall rather balanced. 


Mouthfeel: A bit thin; light / medium; OK for an American Porter. (I tend to prefer the English). The mouthfeel was creamy and very smooth, also a bit syrupy.


Drinkability: Not incredibly interesting but adequately tasty and quite easy to drink. That makes this a very good everyday porter but nothing super special.

175,"2006-07-19",3.2,"12-oz. Pours a dark, predominantly opaque ebony black with amber highlights at the edges. Light layer of tan head that walks away whistling directly. Roast and sweet caramel on the nose. Plenty of sweet malt to balance the roast in the palate; from start to finish this is essentially a marriage between sweet and roast with a bit of hop flourish at the end. Some fizz in the body, and it stands up well, but its somewhere between chewy and quenching and Im not sure whether I like it--sometimes yes, sometimes no. This is a very good example of what I would consider a mainstream porter.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

175,"2006-07-16",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 31, 2009 This porter has an almost sour taste, less roasty and more creamy, like a much darker version of an Oktoberfest.  The hops arent that strong, but theyre there and I like them.  As you drink this beer, its neither too sweet nor too sour, which is a good thing.  Normally I dont like porters that go down this road, but I think this one is alright, although I would prefer it to be much more bitter and have a stronger roast character to the aroma.  Bottom line: a very good beer, but not a very good porter.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","cazort"

Pours an astonishling opaque dark brown with the slightest hint of red highlights and big foamy dark tan head.

The aroma is alluring -- pumpernickel molasses, a hint of agar, lots of roasted grain -- but it doesnt even begin to prepare the mind for the slam-dunk overflowing flavorful goodness of what is to follow. This beer has so much going on: dark chocolate, the sweet pumpernickel that rode in on the aroma, hints of grape and apple that dive back down below the roasted malts before you can really get a handle on them, hints of tannin, a strong and absolutely delightful latte-with-sugar finish. The palate balances out just right, leaving one with a beer that is full on the tongue and yet deeply drinkable -- its hard to slow down as much as the complex flavors merit.

175,"2006-02-26",3.8,"A great porter for this strength. Dense and complex. It looks the business: an impenetrable teak with a fat tan cap that laced and lasted. And it smells great - much stronger than the 5.6% abv would suggest. Its dominated by molasses, with vinous port-like notes, soy sauce, vanilla and nutmeg. Full, creamy mouthfeel. First impression is of sweet, milky coffee, perhaps with a tot of Kahlua in there, licorice root, giving way to a long burnt, dry finish. Figs and a bit of oak in there. Veeery long, phlegmy finish. Too dry and bitter to be sessionable but it makes a fine nightcap. (355ml bottle, IBS Perth, bb June 2007)","Blue Mountains, AUSTRALIA","highlandlad"

175,"2006-02-16",3.9,"Lovely, unrelenting little lip-smacker of a beer this one is. Not convinced it fits in as a true porter and Im quite sure its fermented with a bottom dweller, but that doesnt hinder this at all. Its still so damn good. Tasted from the bottle into a stumpy chalice, cool but not cold. Off the pour a thick, 1"", creamy tan head settled in for the length atop a jet black body. Head stuck like glue to the glass leaving behind conjoined rings of foam. Rich bitter/sweet chocolate on the nose; soothing and enticing, with light notes of licorice, burnt wood and vanilla. Quite dry in the mouth at first and loaded with complex dark malt flavours. Powdery dark chocolate offers a hint of sweetness before burnt grains, roasted coffee beans, bitter malt and hops and even a smidgen of ash dries it all out across the palate. Soft on the tongue, not overly big in body but rich enough in flavour as to keep it interesting. A little into it and signs of vinous dark fruits come through to join the rich malts. Finish was the highlight as a good hour after drinking this I could still sense it in the mouth. Malts linger with rich chocolate and ash, that add up to make this a truly lovely beer. Couldnt say that you could drink this one all night, but by itself its worthy of atleast a few. Cheers!!! (355mL, BB 06/07, Intl Beer Shop, W. Leederville)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Still a freaking benchmark for the style though this time it seemed to have more raisin notes to it. Its still the freaking bomb as porter goes and it is still pushing the boundaries of the style after all this time.

Aroma is rich chocolate, brown sugar, raisin and maple syrup. Body is black and holds a slowly diminishing, two finger thick mocha head. Fore is stewed raisins, maple syrup, burnt malts and burnt bitterness. Has a baltic porter feel to it flavor wise. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style. Finishes like a liquid blast of rum raisin bread and chocolate tinged coffee.

Now the tables have turned, and i have a bigger understanding of porters, so ive bought another six pack this week to re-visit it.  The nose is a light presence of chocolate added with a slight whip cream aroma.  A dark black that in actuality is a brown color accompanied by a little rocky topping of head while it will leave behind a major amount of lacing down the glass. The flavor might possibly be the most smoothest porter i have rated so far even though it isnt the most flavorful.  What does cross my tastebuds is a moderate bitterness level with a dark toasted malt back bone.  As strange as this may sound, but when i take a sip while inhaling the aroma i swear it reminds me of red licorice candy ropes.  Although i admit that this may not be the most richest and tasty porter out there; however, i will proudly say that this is in my favorite top 5 list of the porter style.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"
175,"2005-05-30",4.6,"Anchor porter is one of the definitive examples of robust porter. The head is thick and creamy, as is the texture. There is no roasted barley character, and no bite from over use of black patent. The hops are present, but not overpowering. This is exactly what I expect when I order a porter.","New Orleans, Louisiana, USA","btowles"

Taste has lots of that nutty flavor to it as well. Malty with coffee flavors. Also some hints of bitter chocolate but the nuttiness rules this beer. Bitter-sweet finish. Smoky with a thick mouthfeel. Damn this is a good porter. Complex and just plain tasty. Very drinkable for me.

Pours a deep, blackberry/red-brown with a large, tan, souffle of a head that falls slowly and softly leaving excellent lacing. Heavy malt aromas are dark chocolate and dark fruits, with a light alcohol presence. The full-bodied flavor balances bitter coffee and semi-sweet chocolate, leaving a light tingle of alcohol to dry the mouth... which causes you to open another...

I didnt think much of this beer the first time around but man have I changed my mind.  Near black colour.  Aroma is chocolatey, slightly sharp (acidic).  Slightly roasty, acidic, toasty with chocolate overtones and mocha highlights.

It looks beautiful, pours a deep black with a little red in the light, with a nice tan head. The tase is perfectally balenced. A little sweet (from the smell mostly), a little bitter - like french roast coffee. I think I was expecting this to taste more like Guiness, but Im supprised and pleased that its much better.

Nice mouthfeel. I dont know why, but after it has sat for a few minutes and after I have taken a few drinks, the nose is a whole lot more apparent, and somewhat different from the first one.

Man I want to spoon with this brewery. Lovely Porter. Ive only had it out of the bottle and it ALWAYS satisfies. Pours a deep dark black. Dark like space dark. Head is tan and luscious like  mamas mashed potatoes. The bouquet is incredibly satsifying. The thing that is most interesting about this beer is that most other porters and stouts characteristically and traditionally are dry, so dry that what comes through is the arid texture of the dark roasted malt. Although I am a big fan of this style, it is difficult for my tongue to get past the dry, cracked, paperlike finish of the malt. This brew however is like chewing on a big ball of burnt black WET paper. Alright kind of gross, however not as dry as other porters and thus beautiful. Roasty, yeasty and satisfying this brew is great after a hard days work.

175,"2004-04-29",4.8,"Combined impressions, tap and bottle. My Kryptonite. Beer looks good and black, with a small tan head that will remain for most of your drink (on tap) though I poured it a little aggressively from the bottle and received a good inch and a half of creamy Anchor Porter foam for my efforts. Smells delightfully roasted but not burnt in the same way a properly seared steak doesnt taste burnt. There is an elusive hint in the flavor here that I just cant put my finger on, but it happens to be my favorite note. It could be raisins, or plums or some other mildly sweet and fruity taste with a satisfying toasted aspect to it. Smooth. Not Heineken smooth, which means shallow white bread, but rather immaculately balanced with subtle complexities smooth. Touch of chocolate, touch of coffee. Alcohol is obvious but not distracting in any way--another note to be relished. Mild dryness is nice, not distracting. Mouthfeel is medium thickness, not at all watery, but not syrup by any means. It fits. I think it just might be a little bit bolder on tap, and the flavor might be oh-so-slightly subdued after a sit in the bottle, but if so, its still a pretty close call. Maybe I seem gushy, but this is a good beer that I do not forsee growing past. Goes exceptionally well with hearty food, like a burger, fajitas, chili would be nice... Be careful that you dont drink more than you planned.","California, USA","chispito"

Aroma is very unique and different from any porter I have had; it smells more creamy and chocolatey than anything I have had yet, aside from Young's Double Chocolate Stout.  There is some coffee in the nose, but it is beautifully mellow rather than overpowering as is common; also some toffee smell.  Flavor is malty up front, with lots of chocolate flavor, some light coffee, and caramel, with the perfect bitterness in the finish--great balance.  Feels really good, too; almost as silky as a nitro can but without the nitro; just a tiny bit thin.  Overall, this is a really nice, unique porter.

Flavor was an amazing torrent of malty sweetness, providing a fruity tartness alongside an espresso bitterness, and this combination was nothing short of fantastic.  Better yet was the mouthfeel; this is one of the smoothest beers I've ever had, especially for such a thick brew.  It was exceptionally smooth and creamy, an absolutely delightful sensation.

Texture smooths out and the large portion of this drink is an easy-going, fully flavored ride.

A medium level of body and a fruity sweetness marry well with the other flavors that are in the beer.  Roasted notes are here but somewhat subdued, notes of chocolate, and lots of dark fruit are here as well.  A very well integrated porter that I can always count on and enjoy.

I really need to get around to rerating this one. +++ Served in a 12oz brown bottle. Pours thick,dark black and oily with a moderate brown head that slowly dissipates. Deep black color in the glass - no light penetrates. Strong sweet scent of roasted malts and chocolate.

The initial taste is a light floral sweetness with perhaps a hint of bubblegum sweetness or breadiness.

Deep, deep ruby black color and a taste of huge malt!  Sweet and flowing to back of tongue where a toffee/chocolate bitter rises and slowly fades.

175,"2004-01-05",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 18, 2007 (Bottled) Very dark cola-brown with a smallish, tight and somewhat lacy, beige head. The aroma is quite a bit burned-malty, but nicely chocolate-licoricey with a strong hop presence. Flavor has also chocolate and salty licorice, plus sweet-syrupy maltiness, but especially when colder also a bit too much color malt, making the flavor burned and ashy. As it warms, the sweet malt takes over, and burnedness fades accordingly. Medium to full-bodied, slicky and ashy palate with a sticky, dry and pleasantly hoppy finish. Seems like a beer with many faces: thin and ashy when cold - sweet-syrupy, thick, and Baltic Porter -like when warmer. Very nice, but not quite world-class.
(About a year old bottle, BBE 2005, was 7-4-8-4-16=3.9) Very, very dark, reddish brown color with a light brown, fading head. Quite dry, very roasty, salty and slightly red-wineous aroma with some caramel and alcohol. Initially sweetish, roasted-malty, slightly port-wineous flavor with grassy hops. Turns dry, roasted and slightly bitter towards the finish, and finally ends sweetish, bitter and sugary. Medium to full-bodied, low-carbonated and wineous, sticky palate.

There doesn't seem to be a whole lot going on in this beer and I found it seems to be very overrated IMO.  It seems like a Robust Porter that is missing something, maybe body.","Ambler, Pennsylvania, USA","BrianO"

The warmer beer had more pronounced flavors, which I knew it would.  It had a roasted malt/coffee.  The taste was of roasted coffee with a dry hoppy finish.  I felt this beer was slightly over carbonated.  I didn't like this beer as much as other Anchor beers or as well as other porters.

On opening it at the tasting, Bob simply noted it was sweeter than the Sierra Nevada porter we had just tasted.  Well, the real thing tastes a heck of a lot better than Falstaff light and molasses I can tell you.  Nice dark roast malt flavors and hop bitterness.  A lot more enjoyable than I would have expected given that I seldom drink dark beers.  This one I drained dry and licked the last drop from the upturned bottle.","Radford, Virginia, USA","EKGoldings"

175,"2003-07-23",3.3,"This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized light brown bubbles that were mostly lasting and left a good lacing with a opaque black brown body and no apparent carbonation.  Its aroma was mild with notes of malt and a mild alcohol smell.  Its mouthfeel is initially kind of biting, from the hops,  and finishes with a mild alcohol burn.  The flavor is mild initially and then the alcohol flavor takes over.  I can also taste some licorice in the flavor, but not much else.  I don't get the typical malt and roasted caramel or coffee flavors from this porter and it has more hops than most.  I seem to find myself bucking the trend on this one as I feel it is not the best example of the style.  On the redeeming side, I think it has a higher ABV than listed as I can feel the buzz from just a half a bottle.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

175,"2003-06-30",3.7,"I really was not enjoying this beer when it was cold, but once it warmed up, so did I. This beer appears an opaque purple/black color with a fine caramel color head. This beers taste and palate are all of the above: smooth, velvety, chocolate, smoky, & toffee like. When this beer was cold it had little flavor and little aroma; but once it became room temp all of this beers great characteristics came alive. I really did not feel that this Anchor Porter was a true representation of a porter style beer, it seems more like a stout. Overall, great beer whatever the style.","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
175,"2003-06-30",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2008 A gentle pour evokes a brown-black body and khaki head. Powerful dark fruits embrace liquorice and oily coffee against a balancing almond extract twist. Short mild sweetness before an assault of plump acidity then into a drying, roasty finale. Nimble body, oily texture, restrained carbonation.

Classy combination of dried fruits and coffee on an agile base.

12 oz bottle, best before 09.2008.

Old rating was 8/4/9/5/17 = 4.3.

Rerate: Not too much to add.  Brilliantly simply chocolate, roast and mocha aromas and flavors with hints towards toasted marshmallows.  Robust and delicious and so widely available.  Bumping this up from a 3.9 to a 4.3 after downing a blissful six pack of this ebony slice of heaven.

Pours a deep burgandy almost black.  Light brown head disappears for the most part but leaves behind nice lacing.  Has a pleasant aroma of moderate malt(molasses, roasted) light hops(flowers, perfume).  Finish is more bitter than the aroma or initial flavor will lead you to believe.  Oily, medium-full body leaves behind almost a chalky feel.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

Bad finish and mouthfeel, almost stout like.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
175,"2003-06-28",3.9,"The color is the darkest of browns with hints of burgandy. Head is initially big and tan, but quickly diminishes. Light sweet nose with a wiff of smoke.

Smells faintly of citrusy sharp hop with a bit of some kind of tart raisin or plum fruity darkness. Its flavor is pretty dark and smoothly menacing with a fruity punch and roasty/toastyness taste that continues with a nice mix of light chocolatey bitterness. Milds out as it warms. Feel is very medium, nearly heavy, quite smooth and a bit creamy with a really interesting light little bitterness in the mouth, tongue, and even the lips. Super good stuff.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Initial taste is hoppy, as it should be--nothing special, but the finish is what makes this beer.  The finish is incredibly smooth and sort of relaxing in a way.  The aftertaste is good.  The palate is a full-bodied beer.  A pretty good brew.(5/4//7/5/15)~~~~~~RE-RATE~~~~~~Yikes its beer 11 years since I last rated this beer.  The aroma on this is really nice. Of course, it has the metallic Anchor house character, but it also has a really nice chalky, sweet, chocolate maltiness present.  Its quite seductive.  Slightly transparent mahogany body with a large, foamy, rocky, tan head that takes forever to dissipate.  Starts with a light metallic flavor, before some chocolate sweetness follows.  Becomes nice and roasted in the middle, without being too harsh.  More sweetness and chocolate flavor come through late, with just a small amount of herbal hop bitterness.  This is a gorgeous brew thats incredibly well-balanced and just so damn drinkable.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

Surprisingly, it also finishes with the strangest smoked beef jerky taste that seemed a bit out of place.  Very satisfying low-profile hop finish that wasnt too strong;  something that most American brewers could learn a lesson for when brewing similar beers.  Overall, I was pretty impressed, but I didnt care mch for the smoked taste, but it gives it character.  Anchor continues to impress me.  They have some fanastic brewers.","Illinois, USA","zborgerd"
175,"2002-12-27",3.8,"This porter was dripping with roasted barley, with malty, coffee and chocolate undertones in the aroma. The pour was a glacial black, with my reflection still evident even in light..a true jet black porter with a creamy beige colored head that lasted throughout...a nice touch for a porter. The taste begins with an all out malt assault on the front and sides of the tongue, followed with a carbonated tickling of the middle of your tongue, and then the bittering dryness of those thinly spread hops and the real attack of those roasted barleys hitting the roof of your mouth, the back of your throat and the back of your tongue. A nice creamy head adds to this enjoyment. My only knock on this is the intense ending bitterness is probably a bit too much here, and the aroma is not anything i would call unique in any respects. Overall however a good staple for around the house and another must try again for the list.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"

Chocolate malt sweet/nut aroma and flavor, dark malt roasted coffee and bitterness, some (although not a lot) hop bitternes in the close. All in all, an exceptional package.

Initial taste is a tiny bit sour, and then youre pummeled with an explosion of deep, dark, roasted mocha-chocolate malts. Not so much a bitter chocolate, but a sweet and creamy chocolate flavor. Very low carbonation, which I like; this is what brings the malt flavors out instead of just ending up with fizzy hopwater, which seems to be popular among west coast breweries. However, there are hops here, and they are well done. They lend a floral aroma to the beer and a mildly bitter finish.

Aroma: Fairly subdued, but with noticeable vanilla, and a hint of caramel.
Body: Full, but surprisingly clean-finishing.  Commensurate with the level

There isnt really any one aspect of the beer that overpowers, its just wonderfully smooth and even.  Definitely worth the premium price.

What I remember too much is that dull, woody feel in my gut afterward.  I wanna like this one a little more than how I rate it, but I just find it hard to come back to.  (Sigh...)

Update 3/29/02: Disregard my earlier, idiotic review.  What was I thinking?  Oh well.  This one I had just after having the world-famous Celebrator, and how this one seemed to remind me of it!  Appearance is first-rate.  Black, opaque, lots of initial head, that oh-so-creamy little bit of retention that purrs, suck me off the surface if you can.  Okay, this is getting a little pretentious, so sue me if I like it. :-P!  What bite?  Why was I such an idiot?  This is sweet, smooth, chocolatey, delicious.  Steely Dan playing in the background.  (And the water will change to cherry wine... Perfection and grace, its the smile upon my face.)  I have to bump my rating up a little.  How bout that aftertaste.  Hmmm?  Smoky, woody notes?  (What is a note anyway?)  Burnt feel?  Chocolate?  Part of this nutritious breakfast?  Am I wrong?  Am I wrong?

Drink the damn stuff, okay?

My earlier, idiotic, philistinic review:

When I first tried this, I loved it, though it has worn on me somewhat since.  Certainly has a bite to it as I assume any robust/sharp porter should.  But I suppose Im among those who could do without such a bite.  Hard for me now to down a full bottle.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"

175,"2000-12-31",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2004 Deep brown-black color, nice dark tan foamy, lasting head.  Such a unique and full-bodied porter.  Chocolate  flavors with an incredible bittersweet, roasted malt finish and lingering hops.  Thick and creamy.  Quite satisfying.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
175,"2000-12-28",4.3,"Im also a big fan of Porters. To me this is one of the best domestic Porters made. Its overall presentation is is fairly aggressive and well balanced with a rich chocolate malt nose and flavor. Creamy mouthfeel with thick long-lasting head. Has somewhat of a port wine taste in the background similar to Sam Smiths Taddy Porter. Good stuff!","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

175,"2000-08-02",3.9,"Forgive me if I wasnt as impressed with this as Id hoped.   Creamy, yes - well balanced bitterness, yes, but for some reason, the aftertaste did not agree with me.  And I love porters, too.  Perhaps Ill give this one another shot given all the hype...","Portland, Maine, USA","Sammys"

175,"2000-06-13",3.6,"UPDATED: OCT 21, 2003 dark black colour with a thin and compact head, nice lacing, aroma of dark chocolate, licorice and alcohol, oily, thick, dry malty chocolate finish with a long lasting but somehow rough bitterness","Bienne, SWITZERLAND","Bov"
175,"2000-05-17",4.6,"I have to agree with everyone else here:
this is one of the great porters.  It has just
a hint of chocolate, plus a great roasted malt flavor
and is not overly sweet - it actually has a nice mild bitterness
that seems to result from both hops and the burnt flavors (roasted
malts).","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
175,"2000-05-06",4.5,"Roasted, toasted, rich, bitter, & chewy, with just the right hint of chocolate aroma. Strong mouthfeel. I love the burnt flavor! Abstractly intricate Brussels Lace patterns form on the inside of the glass. Not too overly sweet like many porters. What a great beer!","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
175,"2000-05-01",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 26, 2012 Consumed via bottle.  This is a very nice porter.  It is rich with a nice burnt molasses taste.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","mojoman"
