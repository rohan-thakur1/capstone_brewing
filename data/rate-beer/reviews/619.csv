Earthy, roasty mid palate, tons of coffee, a little black walnut. Not sweet. Its probably entered as a ""Sweet Stout"" cause theres oatmeal in it, but it drinks like an export stout, so it should really be listed as a dry stout. Since theres no export stout category.

Whatever the case, theres a great balance between malt and coffee, with vanilla and light espresso, tending to more mild chocolate on the finish. No alcohol noted, low on fruitiness. No flaws.Coffee flavors are immediately wrapped about sweet, cocoa-vanilla tinged base malts tending quite milk chocolatey and roasty through the middle and ending slightly more bitter and bready, with strong coffee dryness and lingering roasted bean characteristics. No alcohol, again, and with ample carbonation showing moderate tightness to create a very supple texture.

619,"2015-12-06",4.4,"22 ounce bottle, couldnt find the dating so I assume it was smudged off the bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch and a half tan head that stayed around a while. Theres also a good amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like coffee, burnt/charred malt, chocolate and vanilla. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, theres lots of coffee, burnt/charred malt, bittersweet and milk chocolate, and vanilla flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium, its creamy and a bit coating with a moderate amount of carbonation. Its also smooth and pretty easy to drink. I liked this brew a lot, definitely worth picking up if you like stouts and/or coffee beers! $11.99 a bomber.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

Look - Dark black body. Thick tan head with medium bubbles. Blotchy lacing is left behind. It looks very good. An aggressive pour was used to yield the thick head. 

Smell - The smell is typical hoppy bitterness for Floyds. Aside from this it is ice coffee. Chocolate.

Taste - Coffee and chocolate. There is vanilla too. 

Feel - Milky smooth. Doesnt feel too carbonated. Bitterness is left on the tongue. 

Overall - What oatmeal? This is very close to 50/50 coffee/beer. The looks is very tasty but not one for the non coffee lover.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","madelfonatree"

Has some very nice maple syrup type character to it, as well as a bit of chocolate. Not as in-your-face coffee as the 3F Speed Ball (which I thought was great personally), but definitely a much better sweet malt balance. Moderate sweet taste, light to moderate bitter. Medium to bigger body, nice mild chewiness, though not thick. Mild slick finish. Pretty tasty coffee stout. I could probably do with more earthiness, and less sweetness, but thats just a matter of preference. I dig the big coffee though, and the maple nuance.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
