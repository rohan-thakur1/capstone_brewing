4441,"2009-11-22",3.9,"Very hazy very deep dark blood red; Very big and deep aroma, tons of raspberry covers the actually a little to sharp vinegar like touch; Extremely acid body with a light acetic touch, I didnt manage to get use to the sourness all trough the beer, it was biting me hard every time I took a sip; I finishes long and insanely acid the finish actually burned so much that the aromas didnt stand much of a chance.","Aarhus, DENMARK","henrikb"
4441,"2009-11-15",4.2,"Slight red in color.  Nice head.  A bit more tart in taste than other Lambics I have tried but had a wonderful finish and easy to drink.  Highly recommended.","Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, USA","oOJUXEOo"
4441,"2009-08-06",4.1,"(Draught)  Pours a cloudy deep red body with no head.  Aroma of leaves, grass, raspberries, and straw.  Flavor of tart raspberries, light citrus, and earth with a dry finish.  Excellent!","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
4441,"2009-07-17",3.7,"Tap at WSF. Slight hazy red coloured with no head. Aromas of spice, sour raspberries and vinegar. Dry and tart flavour with notes of dust, vinegar, raspberries, funk and red currants. Very fresh and fruity. Great.","DENMARK","Madsnp"
4441,"2009-07-06",4.7,"A Mes rate. Barrel at the Weekend of Tarts.My word, this was a good one. Its quite some time since I have looked forward to something as much as this and it actually exceeded my expectations. Looks wise, its a vision of cloudy pink / red awesomeness. Aroma reminds me very much of the original Cantillon Framboise. The flavour is utterly stunning. Just the right amount of incredible raspberries that never overpower the sublime base lambic. Im unusually lost for words here. Downable as hell. A perfect balance of juicy fruit and pucker sourness. Length is out of this world. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant beer.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
4441,"2009-07-03",3.7,"Draught at Weekend of Spontaneous Fermentation  Hazy, red/pink body.  Acidic aroma of raspberry, strawberries, ...  Soft, lightly acidic, moderately sour flavour.  Hints of vanilla.","Aarschot, BELGIUM","diabel"
4441,"2009-06-21",4.7,"Pinkish ruby colour.  Flat.  Full fruity aroma (rasp.), almost a bit of rhubarb.  Tart body, but accessibly juicy with robust fruit and a great body.  Long, woody finish.  Wonderful.  For me, best of show at the WSF.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
4441,"2009-06-11",4.4,"Draft at WSF. Hue is jewel candy-red, a pristine and perfect color. Aroma is subtle raspberry, subdued sourness, some wood, and lingering lactic notes. Flat easy palate. Exceptional flavor profile, but not a lot of funk. Is rather sophisticated, refined. Lots of raspberry seed flavors. The fruit is at once powerfully dry yet subtly sweet. One of the most memorable beers at the festival.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
4441,"2009-06-10",3.8,"Tap @ WSF. Pours a unclear bloody red with no head. Sour dusty raspberries. Fresh, tart and very funky and fruity. Nice.","Odense, DENMARK","Dedollewaitor"
4441,"2009-06-10",3.8,"Cloudy red with no head. Aroma has funkiy hay, wood and leather and lots of raspberries. Quite acidic with funk and berry flavours","Odense, DENMARK","Christian"
4441,"2009-06-06",4.5,"Tap @ WSF.  Pours cherry red and still.  Aroma of sweet raspberries, but not cloyingly sweet to go along with typical Cantillon funk.  Taste is full of superbly sour raspberries, best Ive ever tasted.  Some spritzy citrus notes in there as well.  Finishes with plenty of sourness and lingers long.  A beautiful beer and probably the beer of the festival in my eyes.  Im just glad I managed to get another glass before MesandSim finished it all!","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"
4441,"2009-06-02",3.4,"Hazy red with no head. Aroma was sourish with rasberries and hints of wood. Flavour had sour rasberries, wood and barnyardish notes. Fiinished sour.","Frederiksberg C, DENMARK","KimJohansen"
4441,"2007-04-28",4.0,"Draught  No head, colour halfway between cyclamen and cardinal red. Rainwater, raspberries, (quite) a bit of wood or straw - and strawberry aroma! Very dry tasting, fruity but not really outspoken raspberry, tart, rhubarb flavour on the palate. Very slick, dry as a skeleton, no fruit filling however. Very good, if a bit discreet on the matter of raspberry, fruitlambic, dry as none.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
