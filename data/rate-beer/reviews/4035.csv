4035,"2017-06-11",3.7,"16 oz can. Pours a cloudy golden color and topped by a thin layer of bubbles that holds steady and no lace to speak of. The aroma shows notes of citrus fruit, toasted biscuit and dry, crackery malts, some wheat, and floral and citrus hop notes. The flavor follows and shows more of the citrus fruit, dry wheat, toasted biscuit malts, peppery spice, crackers, and a firm citrus and floral hop bitterness on the back end. Medium bodied and easy to drink with balanced carbonation that leads to a lengthy, dry, bitter sweet finish. Not as juicy as their ipas, but a solid, easy drinking pale ale with a nice dry finish.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

4035,"2015-12-10",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2016 750mL bottled November 2015 (no bottled on date, must not have that up and running at the new facility yet), drunk 12/10/15.Well the first thing to note is that this is brilliantly clear. It sat in my fridge for about two weeks, but even two months didnt remotely clarify stuff like fort point. Assumedly this isnt heavily dry-hopped? Or things are just clarifying better at the new facility? Guess we will find out in time. Clear, brassy honey colored body is topped by a large white head that is very well-retained.Sweeter, nearly buttercream malts in the nose must be from the caramel malts, as Ive never encountered diacetyl in a Trillium beer. Golden apples and raisins, dill, green onion jelly and only a very light smattering of lemon/nectarine from the mosaic (though the dry, leafy earthiness is there). Free from any yeast-derived b vitamin/aspirin. But overall, this is just weird. Way too much butter/raisin/apple/onion and no actual crisp or bright hop notes.Crisp, peppery, dried herb hop notes and much higher attenuation than Fort Point are the first things I notice. A bit of powdered sugar/marshmallow-like character on the finish is mildly unpleasant, but mostly passing. Tons of herbs and light lemon notes attempt to keep it bright but theres a mushy apricot character from the mosaic and malt sugar interplay that prevents it from being supremely crisp and refreshing. The carbonation is pretty close to perfect, as usual, and the texture is just a bit grainier (though still with plenty of malt softness) to match the hop character and more sessionable nature of the beer. Good, easy-drinking stuff and clean, but the mosaic notes mixing with caramel malts are definitely not ideal.  5/5/7/4/15Rerate, batch 3, I believe and wow is it a whole new world.  As predicted, Trillium was just having growing pains with the new facility and the first/earliest batches of this, Scaled and Scaled Up should not be judged.  Yes, it sucks if you paid money for those and got a subpar beer, but given how great Trillium is to their fans, Im certainly willing to look past it (also, the beers werent bad, just not quite up to the high standard Trillium sets).Anyways, this was juicy, soft, heavily hazy, tropical and with a delightfully malty, but well-attenuated texture and dryness.  No sign of any of whatever the buttery character was on the early batches.  Really, really nice beer.  Rating is for this version.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
