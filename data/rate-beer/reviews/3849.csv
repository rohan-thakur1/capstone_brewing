3849,"2017-05-27",4.1,"Having a can in the Basking Ridge. Might be known for the rave reviews I heard in the kitchen of ""it's not the worst I've had,"" ""you know what's just above this? Focal Banger,"" and ""I don't remember it tasting like caramel."" Very malty IPA, but you know what I always say - better malty than salty! Full disclosure I've never said that about beer before but I might start, I see it sweeping the nation as the new beer slogan for the growing craft market.

Righteously a classic, Its Pretty Awesome indeed.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

3849,"2016-06-18",4.1,"250 ml. draft @ Gollem. This one is a real classic of American Brewing. Very dark orange with a big creamy tanned head, nice lacing. Taste is big pine resin, big herbal bitterness & substantial bread malts base, orange & some sugar. Taste is big pine resin goop bitterness with a clear herbal character, leading into big malt presence, dried orange peel, bready malts, sugar, finish features some raw wet barn & mothballs hops, touch odd & bit lesser, low apricot & candy qualities overall. Boyd is lightly milky & thick. Meltier than your average modern day IPA & hop is more herbal and pine bitterness rather than some of the modern day fruit explosions. It is more classical profile (if that term means anything with regard to the USA beer scene were even classics get completely rearranged from time to time que Stone for instance).

3849,"2016-01-25",4.8,"Kolor: Nie mogło by być - ciemnozłoty, królewski kolor. 100% klarowności.
Piana: Bogata, biała, drobno- i średnioziarnista czapa.
Arcyprzyjemnie dziurawi się pozostawiając ogromną ilość puchu na ściankach.
Każdy wypity łyk odbija się kolejnym krążkiem piwnym. Gruba otoczka do ostaniej kropelki pozostaje na powierzchni.
Nie ma się do czego tutaj przyczepić. 
Zapach: Ponieważ kolekcjonuje kapselki piwa otwieram zazwyczaj bardzo delikatnie, aby nie uszkodzić kapsla.
Bardzo rzadko zdarza się taka sytuacja gdy już przy pierwszym podważeniu nożem uwalnia sie silny aromat z piwa, który wypełnia całe pomieszczenie.
Tak było tutaj.
Początek to gwałtowna eksplozja żywicznych, leśnych, sosnowych nut.
W tym piwie jest tego co niemiara.
Wkrótce już do nich dołączaja owoce cytrusowe - sporo grejpfruta, ananasa, mandarynek.
Po pewnym czasie aromat robi się bardziej słodki, delikatnie uwydatniony karmelem, a potem owocami tropikalnymi. 
Smak: Czysty, wytrawny, bezkompromisowy smak.
West Coast IPA w pełnym tego słowa znaczeniu.
To co pokazuje AleSmith IPA to całe bogactwo lasów tropikalnych z ich żywicznymi, sosnowymi nutami.
Skórka od białych, świeżych grejpfrutów, mandarynki, ananasy, pomelo i odrobina gorzkich pomarańczy.
Nie ma tutaj ni kszty słodyczy.
Karmel, cukier czy inne sugestie nie istnieją.
Słodowa baza z minimalnym chlebowym posmakiem szybko zostaje zmieciona z powierzchni przez amerykańskie chmiele.
Goryczka jest średniej siły. Jest krótka, grejpfrutowa i znika jeszcze przed kolejnym łykiem.
Określenia takie jak: sesyjny, pijalny, rześki, lekki, delikatny, czysty idealnie odnoszą się do tego piwa.
Arcydzieło! 
Wysycenie: Niskie. 
Podsumowanie:

Trudno określić czy jest to najlepsze IPA jakie w życiu piłem.
Bez najmniejszej wątpliwości znajdzie się w Top 3.
Królewski trunek stawiający tak wysoko poprzeczkę dla innych browarów, że ciężko nawet się do niego równać.
Miarą jakości tego piwa jest KILKA TYSIĘCY najwyższych ocen na portalu RateBeer.
I niech nikt tego nie neguje.
Ludzie z całego świata zdecydowali, że to właśnie to piwo zostało wybrane Numerem 1 na świecie w szerokiej kategorii India Pale Ale.
Oczywiście w pełni zgadzam się z tą oceną.
Piwo oferuje czysty chmielowy, wytrawny profil.
Złożone nuty cytrusowo-żywiczne, nienaganna piana, lekkość, orzeźwiający profil i przyjemna goryczka - wszystko to tworzy perfekcyjny obrazek.
Ciszę się, że miałem okazję dostarczyć swoim kubkom smakowym takich emocji.

Appearance: Coppery body in a hue, mostly clear with a full-sized flush of plush, off-white foam crowning the brew. Lovely lacing on the descent.

Smell: Citrusy - fruity, zestful and juicy with a backing of pine needless atop some slender pale maltiness and light touch of orange blossom honey.

Taste: Pale malts with a little honeyed sweetness. Fresh, chin-running citrus juices and a playful fruitiness is cut by a vein of resinous pine. Moderate bitterness. A little touch of honey dew and mint. Near dry and lightly bitter on the finish.

3849,"2015-12-02",4.1,"This was poured into a becher pint glass. Bottled on 10/19/2015.
The appearance was a hazy semi-burnt orange color with a decent transparency about it. Carbonation can be seen rising at a moderate pace. A one finger white foamy head started and dissipated at a nice pace. Messy clingy and semi-foamy lacing runs around the glass nicely.
The smell starts off with sharp resinous pine rolling into some bitter citrus rind and then a light malt backbone.
The taste wraps up the previously mentioned flavors in a nice bittersweet fashion. Lingering sweet citrus aftertaste collides into the finish nicely, somewhat dry.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Carbonation comes across fairly nice. Hop bitterness shows enough harshness on my tongue.

April 2014. 24th of April last year! Thats more than 1.5 years ago! I realise that its a long way from San Diego to Oslo, but this is ridiculous! So, not surprisingly, the aroma is not as hoppy as Id hoped for. However, the aroma is actually quite inviting, and I get intriguing DIPA-like notes of overripe tropical fruits and sweet caramel. Pretty strong flavour of overripe grapefruit, ditto tropical fruits, especially peach, some pine and lots of caramel. The taste is light to moderate sweet and the long-lasting finish is moderate+ bitter. Mid-bodied, dry and with a moderate carbonation. I actually enjoyed this one very much, despite its old age. Tastes like a moderately hopped DIPA.

The frothy white head sticks around at the half finger level the entire time. Heavy citrus notes in the aroma...probably grapefruit. Taste is just ridiculously smooth and well balanced. Healthy malt backbone which is part of what differentiates this IPA from other offerings. Citrus is a big star in this one but its offset by a nice tropical fruit sweetness. So, so happy this brewery is distributing to Minneapolis now. This is basically a perfect IPA.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"

The aroma was a presentable nose that offered a blend of grapefruit & tangerine, with a touch of tropical scent. Medium bodied, backed up by good carbonation, the taste added a touch of malt sweetness, and citrusy bitterness combined with a resinous nature that prompted the lingering side of the astringency. An altogether decent IPA.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

3849,"2014-10-05",4.2,"Transfer from BA review on 12-8-13-

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours an amber-orange color with a thick looking three finger white colored head. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a fantastic level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 

 Smell  The aroma is heaviest of a tropical fruit smell with tons of tangerine as well as aromas of pineapple, mango and papaya. Along with these fruity smells is a good showing of hops. The hop aroma is heaviest of a grapefruit smell, but is accompanied by aromas of pine and a little bit of earth. A little bit of a bready aroma there is there as well, mixing with the rest to produce a quite delicious smell overall.

 Taste  The taste begins with a slightly doughy and bready taste combined with a lighter tangerine and other tropical fruit flavor. Right from the start the hops can be tasted, with the beginning having a moderate showing of a grapefruit hop flavor. As the flavor advances from the start, the grapefruit gets a bit stronger in taste all while the sweeter flavors dwindle. At the same time the doughier flavor vanished from the tongue being replaced by a drier biscuit like taste. Nearer to the end, a pine hop taste starts working its way onto the tongue. While it starts out lower in intensity, it soon takes over the grapefruit hop flavor, with the total of flavors leaving a rather dry, bready and biscuit, resinously hopped flavor to be left on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the averages to slightly thicker side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is average. The thicker body really amps up the resinous hop flavors of the brew nicely allowing them to coat the mouth, all the while the average carbonation keeps it a little bit crisper and helps with the drier tastes of the brew. 

 Overall  A quite tasty IPA with a nice blend of grapefruit and pine hop. A rather enjoyable drink I must say.","","Darkmagus82"

Presents a sizeable, firm white head atop a slightly hazy pale gold body.
Intense hop nose; pine, grapefruit, cedar, dried leafy herbs, unripe melon & stonefruit, with a measure of lightly toasted & golden syrup malt in support.
Moderate carbonation, body is full but certainly doesnt give away its substantial strength, long on the palate, clean, a touch of malt chewiness.
Ever present hops continue their tirade on the palate - plenty of grapefruit rind, melon pith, pine sap, bay leaf sort of character going on, packs a lot in there.

3849,"2014-07-14",4.6,"650ml bottle. Pours a hazy deep golden amber, with a medium off-white head, which lasts well and leaves very good lacing. Fresh spruce, citrus peel and morello cherry hops notes sit over a caramel malt base to create the aroma. Prickling pine and Seville orange hops up front fade gently into caramel malt and the merest hint of vanilla in the mid-palate. Softer, fruity hops notes of plum and black cherry add interest to the finish. This really is an exemplary IPA. Much more subtle than others in the American style, it offers great depth of hops flavour, giving it much more character than the raft of IPAs that rely on nothing but straight bitterness. One of the best beers I have had in a long while.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"

NOS : bardzo intensywne aromaty tarty, pompelo, krwiste pomarańcze, mango, jałowiec, pieprz. Jest również mocny aromat alkoholu i żywicy. 

USTA : piwo jest średnio nasycone o konsystencji tłustego mleka. 
Piwo jest intensywne pod każdym względem. Mocno słodowe o typowej nucie tarty. Do tego wanilia. Zanim uderzą cytrusowe nuty amerykańskich chmieli, żywica i alkohol wychodzi na wierzch.

Bottled: unk

Pours honey with an etched surface and soapy white rim. Notes of grapefruit, honey, biscuit, resin, peach and a bit of grass; relatively malt forward for a CA IPA. Flavor is sweet and honey like. Not particularly bitter, plenty of lemon and tangerine, but nothing particularly assertive. I think the malts are overpowering in this example, and the bitterness needs a bit of help queuing up. Medium bodied with nice, slightly hi and sharp carb and an off dry finish. Decent beer, and Id suggest it to an IPA newcomer. I wouldnt suggest it to a tried hop-head. Too much malty sweetness is similar to the 90min IPA.

Now that its on the shelves in Colorado and I have a few more bottles under my belt, the verdict isnt good: A lot of pine sap / resin, caramel, orange oil and diacetyl levels ranging from medium to mild. One bottle was overrun with buttery solvent, another had only a hint. Ive noticed the same in the X and ESB. Its sweet, chewy and thick, bitter and a little pasty / vitamin-like. Given the flaws and undesirable hop and yeast flavors, AleSmith is now on my Do Not Purchase list given their inconsistency. Its a shame that people new to beer will continue to look at AleSmith as an example of well-made products when they make them so carelessly now.

This is my 1st Alesmith product and I got it in a trade from MaxStout. Thank you!

A friend was supposed to join me tonight to split this, but plans fell through. I wish he could have made it. Dont get me wrong - it will be no problem for me to finish this bomber on my own (the ABV is not that high), but its much more fun to share a legendary brew like this with someone who knows the beer culture, and has fun (like I do) interpreting the brewers intentions.

I now have a bunch of these Alesmith products, so I guess I need to get used to the wax surrounded cap/neck huh?

Ap: Cloudy golden (almost amber-ish) color with a generous amount of carbonation and 1/2 inch head. Very standard for the style, yet still gorgeous. I love the foaminess - and there is plenty!

Ar: Grapefruit, caramel, pine, and with a malty orange-like backbone.

T: Surprisingly, not that bitter (ala Stone ""Ruination""), and Ive got to admit that on my very first sip, I was a bit let down. Subsequent sips (actually gulps) there is tons of taste, the carbonation level is great, and the malt is definitely there (despite what others have stated on previous reviews). This beverage reminds me a bit of Founders Dry-Hopped Pale Ale (only I know its not dry hopped) only this is more extreme. Very balanced.

P: Although Im sure many will disagree, but I actually think this resembles an English IPA in its lack of upfront bitterness and its ""malt before tongue-bruising"" way. I respect that.

Overall: Does it deserve a place in the top 100? Its totally a flawless beer, but I still think ones such as Bells Two-Hearted, FFF Dreadnaught, and a few others more memorable. I think it still does....but I might have put it a bit lower in the rankings....my two cents.

NOTE AFTER SAMPLING FOR A BIT: Is this thing unfiltered? The foam never stopped throughout my entire session and the glass now looks like it went through a car wash on max setting. Maybe thats part of its charm.","Washington DC, USA","Chaneybr"

Pour a clear light amber with a couple of lazy bubbles floating up to the top. Fat bone white head that fell slowly leaving all kinds of lace to look at. Thick cap and ring.

Fruity with tonnes of tropical fruits on the nose to begin with, there is also a touch of spice and a solid, juicy aroma along with some nice, lighter pine hops and some bitterness.There mango and citrus along with some sweet malts, caramel, mango and some grapefruit.

Dark golden colour with a great, two finger sized and foamy white head on top that looks to hold pretty well initially. There is some lacing left on the sides of that glass and the beer is a clear looking one.

Sweet malts and caramel upfront with some pine hops and grapefruit giving a sweet, medium strength bitter taste. The beer is a great one with plenty of tropical flavours coming through that includes some mango, orange and tonnes of hops yet the bitterness levels are not too strong.

Medium bodied and very smooth with an almost creamy mouthfeel and good, strong carbonation. There is some sweetness and a medium bitter finish.

Probably the best beer Ive ever had, this one is as close as Ive come to perfection in a beer. Starting with a great tropical fruits and pine hop aroma that matches the taste.

3849,"2013-03-30",4.1,"Pours a clear, pale golden color with a soapy antique white head. The head is rather stubborn, which contributes to the sustained attractiveness of the beer. Sticky suds lace the glass as the beer is being drunk. The bouquet consists of pine, grass and lemon zest, with occasional notes of burning peat. It has a soft, wet mouthfeel that yields to a gentle carbonation scrub. A lot of pine flavor from start to finish. Less prominent grapefruit flavor, but the bitterness unique to grapefruit is present. It is well-balanced by the grain, and, thankfully, not overpowered by it. The pleasant mouthfeel rounds out the experience. Nothing to get terribly excited about, but a good IPA.","Pensacola, Florida, USA","DocJitsu"

Out it comes with a clear golden body, much clearer than most ipas, and a big white foamy head. Aroma is hoppy, pine, grass, dust, light caramel. Taste is good balanced between the same grassy / piney hop flavors anf malt. Good, but not breathtaking in my opinion, in fact I find both the aroma and taste a bit onedimensional. Its got a very robust bitterness, lasting long through the finish which leaves a malty and grassy aftertaste.

A: Pours a slighty hazy bright orange with a foamy white head. 

S: Best smelling non-imperial IPA Ive come across. Big west coast notes of pine, bitter and sugared grapefruit peel - dryness. Huge dank skunky pineapple and mango astringent notes pound through. Fantastic stuff

T: Great balance between crisp, refreshing, dry bitterness from the pine and grapefruit, and the dank sweet tropical fruit flavors. Will load up come summer

Taste explodes onto the palate with a rush of pine/grapefruit/blood orange, some sweet vanilla ice cream, and then an understated mix of pale and light caramel malt. What a fantastic hop hit - so so fresh - feels like youre being dragged through a pine forest. Mouthfeel is medium/full with a wonderful lingering resinous/citric bitterness.

I cant believe it has taken this long to rate this gem but I guess when you assume you can just pick up a bottle that happens. The price is a little higher than it was a few years ago. Regardless this comes in about the same as a four pack of Headhunter, White Rajah, or other local Ohio IPAs worth sampling.

Aroma / Appearance - The active carbonation bubbles like a transparent cauldron. Caramel bronze with a thin crust of white head present the balanced appearance of a robust IPA.

Flavor / Palate - Citrus and grapefruit bubble across the tongue. Flowing freely behind is a torrent of honeydew melon and floral hops. This is refreshing with a finish that hangs in the air like cigarette smoke.

3849,"2012-10-28",3.8,"Finally, a fresh bottle of Alesmith IPA. Ive been wanting to sit down with a bomber of this for years. 

The beer is hazy and light orange in color, with a half inch of head that leaves some sticky lacing on the pint glass. 

The aroma brings grapefruit, pine, sweet candied fruit, and malt. The scent is a notch above the flavor, gaining in intensity as the beer gradually warms. 

The flavor is hop forward, but definitely brings a healthy dose of malt along for the ride. I believe this is what many brewers try to achieve when brewing ""balanced"" IPAs. Sweetness is present throughout, with some sticky pine resin clinging to the palate. Of course, personal preference plays a role in my rating, but I would like to see the malt bill toned down a bit, giving way to the grapefruit and other citrus flavors. This brew is a little too sweet for my liking, though I certainly dont find it cloying.

The feel is sticky and sweet, with a noticeable pine presence throughout. Alcohol presence is there, though subtle and unobtrusive. The body is medium, with a light bitterness in the finish. Unfortunately, the hop bitterness is somewhat cancelled out by the malty sweetness.

Overall, a good brew and worth a try. Not in the same league as the Alpine Nelson I had last night. Still, tasty and enjoyable.

Thats especially strange when you consider the number of highly dedicated beer drinkers who flow in and out of the tasting room on a daily basis. It pours a leathery brown color, and the bouquet develops into a nice pine aroma, with lots of resin and dark sweets. The palate is a little flat (not unlike my perpetually under loved bike tires) and savory, but not too intense either. It has that fresh pine crispiness of the dry hops, and thats really what defines it; its a singular ode to the dry hop process, showing off how it tastes different than a regular IPA.

The balance is wonderful betweent the malty sweetness, the deftly measured hops and the exquisite bitter ending. The hops dont jut out in any one direction.

Love the appearance now, big foamy head but it fades quickly leaving a great lacing.  Aroma is packed with pine, spruce, flowers, and citrus.

Date: None listed
Glass: Tulip

Pours a 2cm head of fairly clean, white foam, made up of small, dense bubbles. This fades to a 0.5cm cap atop the beer throughout the drinking session, leaving substantial lacing while doing so. Body is golden orange in color, transparent, with plenty of active carbonation.

Aroma of peaches, lemon rind, grapefruit rind, apricots, with a mix of malts as well. Pleasant, upfront, and substantial, this is enjoyable and worth repeat exposure.

Tasting opens with darker-than-pale malt flavors that quickly transitions to pine resin and grapefruit bitterness. Mid-palate continues malt body, combined with grapefruit bitterness, citrus-like fruit, and pine resin. Nice flash of tart bitterness in back of palate, leading to a lingering bitterness in close, with hints of apricot, peach, and grapefruit.

Aroma is grassy floral pine with some lemon-orange and just a little bit of zesty/spice hop character intermingling with some light nectar malt sweetness.  This zestiness seems to come out more in the flavor, with a bit less citrus/pine.  Moderate-to-heavy bitterness.  Just a hint of metallic component, perhaps from being such a naked flavor profile.  The body is incredibly light and drinkable, especially compared to other 4.0+ rated IPAs which may be more intense.  Nonetheless, this particular bottle isnt delicious enough in flavor to merit such a rating.","Providence, Rhode Island, USA","PapaSkeetSkeet"
3849,"2012-07-22",4.0,"Cloudy medium to light amber with a creamy off white head. Big mix of aromas of fruity/light on the pine/light on the herbal, and candied caramel.

Medium bitterness, medium sweetness, a small bitter aftertaste, and a light dry finish. 
This is a solid and great ipa, and I have to keep reminding myself its not a dipa. Probably one of the best ipas this palate fancies. It is a joy to have a wonderful nose from every sip and have it overpowered by the hop perfume. The flavors dont seem to be over the top or to special, but all around its a great experience.

3849,"2012-05-28",3.7,"Bottle from Ølbutikken, Copenhagen, shared with Foffern and Inbreak. At last: the fabled AleSmith IPA - the search has been long and finally we were rewarded with a bounty of this top ranking beer at Ølbutikken! Been looking forward to this for a very long time. Aroma is grassy syrupy DIPA-ish hop tones, hints of nougat and honey melon. A bit faint; I had expected a more pronounced nose on this one. Taste is dry grassy hay tones, crispy leaves, hints of melon, grapefruit, wood and hazelnuts. Smooth, velvety and pretty compact mouthfeel; this beer feels heavier than it is and overall Id put it more in the DIPA landscape than at least the classic American IPAs. Nice, but no. 1 in the world? Very far from it, as far as Im concerned.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

I first had this IPA in southern California, and it was the same trip I had Pliny an Sculpin. Ive been able to drink it again and have some revisions. Pours a beautiful clear, light amber color. Aroma is wonderful: hops and grapefruit, citrus, pines. Taste changes as the beer warns up. At first (say below 40 degrees), the pine and hops at dominant. As it warns up, some malts come through. Has a bitter, hoppy finish. Still a great IPA, though not as high as I rated it first time.","Tennessee, USA","jhgrantjr"

3849,"2012-02-27",4.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/11/2010.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip. 

Alesmith IPA pours an amber copper color, with a full, creamy, off-white head. Great retention, and sticky lacing all over the side of the glass.

Great, full hop aroma. The smooth citrus notes are well balanced with some tingly pine. Grapefruit and orange rind provide the fullest part of the aroma.

The full hop flavor is in control the whole time, but it does allow the malt to provide a good foil up front. Caramel bready malt provides a sweet base for the juicy hops to explode on the palette. Grapefruit and orange provide the most pop, and the pine notes add another level of complexity.

Nearly silky smooth, there is a slight graininess, but nothing that takes away from each sip. The generous hop flavors and full malt bill contribute to a fuller than average body. Bigger than a regular IPA, smaller than a DIPA. 

This is a well-balanced, full IPA with a great hop bill. I wish I had access to this more often.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Pours out a most attractive deep golden colour with just a tiny hint of haze, but all in all its pretty clear. Aroma is tropical sweet and delicious. Loads of honey and cereal, light toffee and caramel. Behind that you have touches of ripe mango, pineapple, pine, resin and a slight hop-glue effect which I love. Flavour is very well balanced, hits you up front with good bitterness, fresh citrus and herbs with a refreshing lightness, but this belies the subtle richness and creamy body of the beer. Lovely caramel and runny honey, good sweetness that balances the awesome hoppiness, but yet the hops never get too much. Mids show  slight graininess with citrus.

Grapefruit and orange are still definitely in there, though, with some grassy notes, some iced tea, some caramel, and a little biscuit and pineapple all working their way in somehow.

3849,"2011-04-27",4.1,"Rating #531, bottle from Vinspecialisten Islands Brygge  

I saw this beer on my local watchlist and had to go to Vinspecialisten the day after to get it. First of all, that was a great surprise as I had never been to Vinspecialisten before and their selection was way better than expected. Especially their BeerHere and Mikkeller selection was great, and there were a lot of belgian brews I hadnt noticed anywere else, though not any infamous specials of any kind.   Well, back to this specific beer. Its an amber coloured beer with a very good head, and as it gets to stand a little the head gets a more dense whipped cream-like look. Great hoppy nose, flowery and spicy with a delicate touch of ""tutti frutti"". Taste is bitter right from the start and has a lot of spicy hops and the special tutti frutti taste as well together with some raspberry and citrus. Sturdy and sweet, dry IPA-taste. Finish is strongly bitter and has a bit of alcohol. Palate is magnificent - soft, thick, and perfect for this IPA. All in all a really great brew, but not with any extraordinary elements that makes me go nuts over this IPA compared to other high end IPAs. Ive tried more complex ones, but its definately still a great brew.","Nysted, DENMARK","flemmingwillum"

Flavor wise the brew leans more towards the hops than Malts which is what I expect from a Ca. IPA, but there was some malts so it was not what I consider a hop bomb. It was a good IPA. I dont know what the hype was all about. I had a rather fresh bottle and shipped in the winter so I would think it was a good one. Dont get me wrong I would drink it again I went down great but it was a rather average IPA to me

Taste follows suit, but adds tons of pine, and a great bitter kick. Malt backbone is perfect - the hops never get out of control, and all the hop-associated flavors are allowed to come out smoothly with each sip. Mouthfeel is great, as the carbonation is there just enough to keep everything moving around, but not too much as to get in the way of any of the awesome flavors.

Not quite as earth shattering now but this beer will always be a classic example of an excellent IPA for me.","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"

3849,"2010-11-28",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 20, 2013 Quick Re-Review.  Obtained a fairly fresh bottle (July 5, 2013, enjoyed August 20, 2013), from an online store.  Felt my first go-round may have been on the old side.  This does seem better, but not the best IPA Ive had.  Aroma is peaches, mango, pineapple, fruity hops, citrus, decent bit of pine, decent bit of caramel malt, whiff of alcohol.  Flavor is similar, fruity hops of peaches, pineapple, grapefruit, resinous hops, pine, mild to moderate caramel & bready malt in the middle, nice bitterness on the finish, mild sweetness, quite a bit of solvent alcohol.  Very good, glad to try again, but not the #1 IPA IMHO.  Alcohol is awfully prevalent for a 7% brew.

Original Review 11/28/10:
22oz bottle, unknown date.  Pours hazy orange/amber with a small bubbly white head that leaves some spots of lacing.  Aroma is some citrus (orange, grapefruit) and pine, some pineapple and tropical fruits, fair bit of caramel malt, a nice blend of sweet and citrus on the nose, good strength.  Flavor starts with pine and resinous hops, some delayed citrus of orange and grapefruit, caramel malt sweetness in the middle, moderate to good bitterness in the lingering finish.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and oily, medium carbonation.  I have a feeling this bottle may be a bit on the old side but I have absolutely no way of knowing since Alesmith doesnt provide a bottled on or best by date (or at least not one I could find).  My first time with Alesmith IPA so I cannot compare to other bottles of this since it isnt available here.  A good IPA, but would love to try a known fresh bottle someday.

3849,"2010-11-13",3.3,"Experienced from a 22oz bomber in a whiskey snifter.

Not a huge fresh hop aroma but it has travelled to Australia and may not be the freshest bottle. Aroma is still pleasant piny more than the fruits of usual fresh IPAs.

Flavor is again grapefruit and citrus, along with the pineapple and an good portion of sweet malts, along with resin and a herbal hop character.

flavor is yesty, coplex hopy sweetness and bitterness,  near perfect malty balance, perhaps a bit on the sweet side, but the very dry hopping almost takes it home. Did i say palate and mouthfeel is quenching and full at the same time?","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Pinball"

Appearance: Almost iced tea like but not quite as dark brown with honey folds and a massive 3 finger off white crown that shows lots of retention and loads of lace.

Smell: A world of hops....floral, citric, grassy, herbal, etc over a caramel / toffee malt.

Lots of lacing is left behind in the glass. Perfect appearance for an IPA. I love the look of a fine bottle conditioned ale.

S- Ahh. A fresh bouquet of hops hits the nose first. A good balance of floral, piny, citrus, and earthy. Subtle caramel malt backbone.

T- Mostly citrus and some piny hops upfront with a subtle caramel malt backbone. Citrus hops fade for the finish and piny and floral hops take over for a refreshing hop flavor kick. What lingers is a hop spiciness and sweet caramel malt. The whole flavor from start to finish has a bitter overtone. Lingering bitterness is medium.

P- Medium carbonation and body. Oily, smooth, and creamy. The hops and bottle conditioned yeast do their job well here.

O- This is a great IPA. Drinkable and good all around. Something I will have again. ABV is undetectable in this brew. Though the bitterness is definitely present it is kept in balance with the hop flavor-which is what this IPA is all about. I look forward to trying other offerings from AleSmith.

Bitterness was lessened in glass and allowed for subtle sweetness and citrus note. Very strong, hoppy flavor nonetheless. Just a little too much carbonation for me.

3849,"2010-01-23",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2013 Bomber via trade, many thanks to phaleslu. Pours slightly hazy, peach-amber with a chunky 3-4 finger yellowish-off white head that has great retention and leaves nice lacing. Aroma is huge on citrus a little pine, wildflowers, mandarin, toasted white bread. Flavor is caramel, toast, bready yeast, some pine, underripe mullberries, crisp mineral notes and fairly bitter citrus hop/grapefruit finish. Palate is light to medium bodied with a strong, pillowy carbonation that is never too sharp but helps provide a velvety overall feel, before the slightly dry finish.

Aroma is sweet citrusy hops with a really nice malty backcone with some light black cherry soda and some sweet vanilla.  The hopping is earthy, resinous with tangy orange and lemon notes as well.  Flavor is complex, earthy malts with vanilla, grass, and woody bark - Hops provide the perfect balance with sweet leafy and citrus spiciness.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth.  Warms the mouth with a touch of alcohol and some spiciness resides in the mouth for a minute or two after a sip.   Nice, but Id love to try some fresh, itd probably tack another point onto aroma and flavor.","Chester, Vermont, USA","Jblauvs"

Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy golden-orange

Flavor: Big hop/bitter flavor, some sweetness, but mostly hops

Palate: Medium-full body, decently long duration, nice mouthfeel

Overall Impression: 
A really good IPA.  These guys make some seriously quality beers, and all their stuff is good, but their hoppy beers sure are great.  Good stuff.  Ive gotta say, I enjoyed this one a lot.  I wish AleSmith would sell their stuff in my neck of the woods, but maybe Im better off, because I could see me drinking entirely too much of this stuff if it was that easy to get.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
3849,"2010-01-13",4.2,"Pours slightly cloudy golden orange color with golden yellowish hues when held to a light source and a frothy, soapy 2.5 finger head with excellent retention, only very slowly fading into a lasting cap that coats the glass with streaks of soapy lacing.

Very earthy hop aroma with a prominent citrus fruit character, subtle pine and faint malt backbone. Lots of lemon peel, mango and grapefruit in the nose as well as some biscuit Graham crackery malt.

Clean crisp medium body that is very hop forward with a good balance of sweet citrus and dry pine notes. Pretty bitter and dry at first but with a nice amount of lemon and orange peel, mango and grapefruit and a subtle Graham cracker malt backbone that doesnt interfere with the glorious hoppiness.

Pours an attractive hazy light copper-orange with generous, pillowy head.  Aroma citrus pine needles.  First sip, damn good. Big citrus. Creamier mouthfeel than expected.  Kinda reminds me of a Dreamsicle (remember those?). Sub-medium carbonation.  Dry bitter finish.  Of the other IPAs Ive had, Im reminded of the Founders Centenial (sim citrus, more bitter) and the Sweetwater IPA.    Intensely h[oa]ppy, balanced with just enough malt.

3849,"2010-01-10",4.0,"Wow, 1000th rating for this beer.  Ill do my best.  22 oz. bottle from Belmont Party Supply in Dayton.  Aroma of citrus (orange, lemon, and grapefruit), floral hops, caramel malts, pine resin, and vanilla.  Smells so fresh.  The flavor also has a lot of citrus and a cool floral hop bitterness, with a good amount of caramel, and notes of pine resin, spices, apricot, and mixed berries.  Lasting finish of citrus and bitter hops, with a lingering aftertaste of the same.  Medium bodied, without the bite of a lot of IPAs, partly because of the mild carbonation.  Nice balance for the complexity of this IPA.  Very, very good.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

3849,"2010-01-04",4.1,"Serving date: 2009-05-17. Served in snifter.

Amber colored, slightly hazy due to bottle conditioning. A 3 cm white head that leaves plenty of chunky lacings as it settles. Decent retention and great looking lacings.

The smell has a very pronounced citric hop character - lemon and grapefruit abound. Plenty of floral hops and hop resins as well. Some caramel and subdued malts. Slightly spicy. The hop aromas are really outstanding and so fresh they almost sting the nose.

A wonderful hop character in the taste as well. Grapefruit and lemon peel dominate. Faint notes of mango. The malty caramel flavor is quite big but still obviously plays second violin with the hops taking center stage. Some spices in the middle. The finish is rather bitter, but the bitterness is really integrated in the overall profile. It finishes with floral hops, pine-needles and again a slightly spicy sensation. The finish is long. No sign of the alcohol.

Medium body, not very crisp. The carbonation level in this one is close to perfect. Medium amount of small and rather calm bubbles - it really suits the beer well.

D: A great IPA. Perhaps not very complex, but very well balanced and with a beautiful hop character of lemon and grapefruit. It goes down really easy.

Excellent sweet character stays present throughout but in the background giving an amazing balance. Finishes pleasantly bitter, not too much, not too little.

Aroma is pretty sweet like a hoppy bubblegum with a little pear.

The smell is a real strong hop flavor. A pretty grassy hop flvor carries this beer from the start with a nice floral flavor.

The taste is, as expected, nice and hoppy with a real strong floral flavor. Some nice clove and citrus fruit flavors are set back after the first hits of hops has had their time on you taste buds.

The feel is pretty darn great. It has a light mouthfeel that goes down pretty darn easy and it just sweet to the taste buds. A great hop experience.","Cumberland, Rhode Island, USA","Duhast500"

3849,"2009-12-07",4.1,"It is practically inconceivable this nearly perfect IPA could be surpassed in any way. The bottle conditioning smooths the carbonation on the tongue and creates a thick, dense head that lasts to the end. Aromas of grapefruit, bread, and butterscotch.

3849,"2009-11-27",4.2,"From bottle (the bottom to be more specific, which im told must have had a profound impact on my tasting experience) shared with brother Eric and awiseman.  Aroma is sweet floral and citrus hops with an emphasis on the sweet.  Didnt get a good look at it in the light, but it look like semi-clear orange with a small rapidly disappearing head.  Could definitely taste the alchol as well as the hops, although to be honest, the hops were as strong as I expected.  It almost had a syrupy mouthfeel, which may have been contributed to by the sweetness.  Went down very smooth.

Something about this aroma is extremely pleasing.  Almost like right after a first spring rain.  The flavor is exceptional... but not at all what I was expecting.  The hops are subtle at first (very nasal driven) and the malt backbone is absolutely perfect.  Hints of plum and caramel are extremely inviting.

Flavor starts lightly sweet and moderately acidic, then finishes evenly sweet and acidic and moderately bitter.

3849,"2009-08-22",4.3,"Pretty excited to finally get this beer for my 450th rating; been looking to get my hands on this for over a year. Pours a deep copper with a full, fluffy head, slides down the side of the glass slowly to reveal excellent lacing. Aroma is not aggressive, but incredibly big and complex; lots of grapefruit, pine, biscuit, and massive shots of resin that hit you, reload, and hit you again. Flavor is similarly excellent, with an initial stage full of candied sugar, caramel malt, sweet citrus, and a bit of honey. This slips into a much more bitter and piney hop character, that was thick almost like sap, then moved to an intensely dry, resinous finish. A welcome tinge of alcohol mixes with the dryness at the finish. Absolutely world class IPA.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

Flavor is an incredibly hard hitting but wholly quaffable arrangement of resinous spruce and pine with some citrus notes that are balanced nicely by a honed malt character containing biscuit, caramel, some burnt sugars, and vanilla. Palate is quite full for the style, leaving a sap like coating on the palate. A slight warming booziness sneaks in unexpectedly but is quite welcomed.

Pours a orange amber, good haze, lively carbonation with offwhite thick moderate head that laces pretty well, dies to a decent layer. Aromas are grapfruity hops and citrusy zest, a touch of soap, faint pine and good to balance caramel and toffee malts. Initial is very bitter, hoppy citrus and pine towards the finish, soap and acidic hoppy bitterness. Body has sufficient malt, but pours on the hops in copious amounts. Strong bitterness, pine takes a further role, citrusy grapefruit and florals come in strong as well. Caramel and toffee malt underneath, but this beer is all about the hops. Finish goes a bit sweet, toffee and bread with a touch of mellow vanilla (As the malt bill is much more mellow than expected.. and very much appreciated.. I hate a cloying caramel bomb), with more fruity notes. The front end and middle are hop heavy. Slanted towards the hops overall, very piney. The head stays around near its original pour level, really quite amazing, laces ok. Hops linger on the palate very well, nothing too sweet, as lingering bread and vanilla seem to be the maltiness.

Nice fluffy head that fades away slowly. Haze orange appearance. This beer looks pretty good. Fruity orange citrus. Holy jeez this is intense. I havent smelled a citrus orange/fruity aroma like this before. As the description says there is a slight pine backing to the aroma. Very pungent aroma that is not hard to smell. A nice citrus hop flavor. Not extremely bitter, which is good. This bitterness allows you to drink this in mass quantities without getting ""hopped out"". Smooth beer, with a taste that is awesome. I cant taste the alcohol, which is great, but can be dangerous for me.  I just cant get over the citrus. This beer is awesome.

A little over-rated, in my opinion, like other things I have had from Alesmith.","USA","Slipstream"
3849,"2009-08-02",3.7,"Perhaps a little too carbonated.  It starts by overflowing the bottle when opened.  The pour is minimally 2/3 head to start.  Forms a solid dome of foam.  Leaves extensive, decorative lace all over the glass.  The liquid itself is hazy with a light gold color.

Interestingly, the initial pour gives off a pleasant pale ale malt aroma.  Letting the beer settle results in a strong floral (pine) hop smell.  

A smooth, high-hopped beer.  While it is spicy and bitter, there is a solid malt base, almost buttery.  Still, this is a story of the hop.  The swallow and the aftertaste is biting, like fresh ground pepper.  The alcohol is well-hidden and the body is neutral for the style.

Pricey, but I will definitely be buying this again.

It poured a sort of dirty blond color in my glass with towering cumulus-cloud head (Duvel-like).  Aroma was a sweet citrus-y hoppiness with some other odd notes present that seemed to fade as the beer warmed and I drank some of it.  Flavor was a really nice IPA - lots of hop citrus and dry bitterness balanced by a significant malt framework.  Mouthfeel was dry and fairly crisp (versus cloying and sticky, which can be the case in some very citrus-y IPAs).  Very good.

3849,"2009-07-09",4.3,"Original review date 5/1/2009...

Man, I didnt get to try this in San Diego last summer so I was wicked happy to see it in a trade. Served up in a Portsmouth snifter...

Pours a golden...and I mean GOLDEN...honey color. Very pure and clean looking. First pour doesnt have much head to speak of but well see what happens. Not too much visible carbonation, but the color on this one alone is a treat.

Oh yeah...the Ruby Red grapefruit hop presence is excellent. Theres a moderate yet unobtrusive sweet honey malt backbone that balances this out quite nicely though...but does the collar match the cuff? Lets see...

Well, theres a slight sweet honey viscosity to this but its not heavy or overbearing. The citrus/grapefruit hops really stand out nicely without a bitter rind sensation. Just tangy, succulent grapefruit. Maybe not as oily as some hop bombs but it carries enough viscosity. This stuff is top-notch.

Even with a tad of viscosity and sweetness the finish is a little dry...and thats a good thing. Crisp and clean, no caffeine...maybe a little rind bitterness shows up on the finish but thats just fine with me. This wraps up in excellent fashion. A little bit of booziness is the door that hits you on the ass on the way out.

Tough to compare to something else. Maybe a Ruination with more of a purity of hop purpose. A little less balanced than Ruination but enjoyable as hell. The booziness emerges a little more with warmth but thats OK. This is a well-oiled machine.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

3849,"2009-07-02",4.0,"Bottle.  Pours a clean clear orange with a heft dense beige head.  Pineapple and clean wet pine hit the nose just from taking the cap off the bomber.  Gorgeous.  Toasty malt behind the lovely hop aromas.  Medium bodied, lightly sweet.  Finishes a little bitter, with a nice long lingering grapefruit tone, and with what may be a slight metallic note, though that was only on the first sip, and didnt show up for the rest of the bomber.  Didnt live up to the aroma, but not a problem, as I could just sit here and sniff this all night instead of drinking it.  The little bit extra alcohol this has over most others goes by undetected.  Well hidden, and well done.  Very tasty.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

Fruity perfumed aroma. Mid orange, tiny scummy head. Very simple APA, weak watery body. Pleasant hoppy taste but absolutely no depth  or complexity at all. Fortunately, its incredible boringness is its only flaw. Predictably simple sweet hoppy finish.

Palate was medium bodied and dry with quite high carbonation. Flavours were pine, citricness, malts, sweetness, pine, resin, hint of vanilla and medium bitterness. Aftertaste was mildly sweet, hoppy and bitter.

Re-rerate, a bottle with a new label. Here the hoppiness was very intense but still very balanced. Hence the update of the overall score from 15 to 17.

Pours a clear dark orange copper color, gentle pour yields a thick foamy inch of white head; visible active carbonation keeps the thick, pillowy head around.  Aroma is incredible... thick, heady bitter grapefruit and resin notes, some light sticky sweet tangerine and orange.  Little if any sweetness on the nose- all hops, and plenty of them.  Flavor starts with sharp, assertive bitterness.  Loads of sharp citrus notes- grapefruit, lime, oranges.  Hop profile rounded out with resin and some pine notes.  Huge, deep, solid hop character.  Palate is full and sharp, plenty of flavor without being heavy.  Light citrus finish.  Overall, absolutely superb.

Nose is a pleasant metallic-citrus, grapefruit with maybe tangerine.

On the palate a huge, mouth savoring juicey-fruity flavor that makes your mouth pucker. Citrus is more towards grapefruits and orange, with some candied sweetness, and the hops also come through with some hop resin & pine sap.

Up front lots of pineapple juice and bubbles followed by fresh grapefruit juice, citrus hops, and some sweet caramel malt. Spicy, dry finish. Best IPA in the world? Pretty close but I might take Sierra Nevada Harvest over this one. But damn this is good.7/5/8/5/16=4.1Fresh bombers from AleSmith are quite possibly the superlative example of a rather ubiquitous and uninteresting style. This IPA reminds me of why I seek out the style in the first place. It pours with a massively rocky yellowish beige head that leaves sick lacing everywhere. Beautiful mango, pineapple, caramel in the nose. Taste is so rich in toffee, caramel, fresh West Coast hops that give this beer a thirst-quenching palate and massively smooth body that makes the entire pint disappear in about 1 minute.

3849,"2009-03-10",4.5,"Most people will say that the best thing about living in San Diego (aka ""Americas Finest City"") is the weather.  While thats true, I also like to point to the fact that both Alesmith and Ballast Point breweries are on my drive between home and work.  That means its very easy to get growler-fuls of this amazing beverage which is truly one of the best things about living in this city.  Pours from growler a murky amber-orange with one finger of lingering white head.  The aroma is great -- fresh hops with notes of pine and citrus at just the right level, not overpowering.  From the nose the fresh citrus carries right across, mainly grapefruit with some orange.  The small amount of sweetness makes this a very well balanced IPA.  Goes down fresh and smooth with some lingering bitterness.  I could drink this all day, and with most of that growler let I think I might.","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"

Theres a flavor story going on: first hop bitterness and piney grapefruit, followed by some malt sweetness, and finishing with bitter hop after taste.  Despite the bitterness, theres no harshness.

On closer inspection, aromas are thick with tangerine and pineapple with a little bit of floral hops as well.  A bit of a caramel malt presence is also detectable in the nose.  From smell, my fear is that this will be awfully sweet and thick.  NOPE.  Its dang good... a lovely mix of caramel malt and hops that balance it out nicely.

3849,"2008-12-23",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 3, 2009 Purchased at Whole Foods Market Pasadena, CA -Hastingsd.

Appearance: Dark, goldish yellow. Moderate amount of rising bubbles. A large off white, fluffy head sits atop.

Aroma: Orange juice, grapefruit juice, citrus rind, pineapple.

Taste: A mouthful of bitterness and citrus flavors mentioned in the aroma. After the bitterness gets acquainted with my palate, I then taste a good amount of crystal malts, that lends a bit of spicy sweetness to the large amount of hoppage.

Mouthfeel: A tad astringent, a little bit tongue curling. Then I notice the trademark smooth softness of Alesmith in the finish.

Overall: Much better than when I first had it. I was told the trick is to get it fresh. I can see how that can be true, as the killer bouquet of citrus aromas takes the beer to a whole nother level. In my little weird world, I would like to make this Summer Yulesmiths little brother.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"

Strong caramel malty IPA in the classic SoCal vein. Cascade-style hops in abundance, lots of caramel malt. All the same flaws as Yulesmith. A reasonably good beer, but I simply dont understand the hype. #1 IPA? Youve got to be kidding me. 10/26/2008

Rerate 9/16/2012. Ive had a few bottle since the original rating, but given that it was not until recently distributed in Washington State, this may be the first time Ive had a really fresh bottle. Im impressed this time around; its really nice. Malts in the back seat, big piney aroma and citrus flavors, a c-hopped IPA in the Sculpin/BigEye vein (or vice versa) with an almost belgian richness in the subtler non-hop flavor components and that vanilla that is mentioned in the commercial description. I didnt give this one enough respect the first few times around. This time Id go more like 8/4/8/4/16. Ill lean heavily in this direction.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Some herbal notes, maybe celery.  Bitter piny hops with hints of citrus.  Very fruity.  This could be a double IPA.  Bitter hops do overpower a bit.

3849,"2008-08-03",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 21, 2008 Finally I rate the number one IPA in the world. A very potent IPA that has a HUGE body due to the strong malty backbone the hops are checked by. Lots of citrus flavors, orangey and limes are everywhere. It finishes piney and a bit hop-oily, but is nice because the flavor profile changes with the swallow so the flavor is constantly changing and exerting itself. It’s like when you start eating ice cream, and then your mouth goes numb because of the cold and you can no longer taste the ice cream because of both the cold and the fact that you have been eating the same flavor the entire time--it just tastes like you’re eating creame; well this beer’s flavor actually changes halfway through the in-mouth experience so it is continually bombarding the palate with new flavors that excite and invigorate the tongue. It is really quite different and deserved of its #1 rating, but I’ll have to only give it a 4.2 because it is only sold in $6 bombers. Who sells single-ipa in only bombers?, that seems ridiculous that I can’t pick up a six pack of this stuff. Worth the wait for sure though.","Maryland, USA","Skeegle"

Citrus flavors are upfront in the mouth, before the pine, floral, and grassy notes take over. The citrus re-emerges on the finish too, which was kinda cool. Great lasting bitterness.

Seems to be some cascade/centinnial in there but not too sure but definitely get the pine and citrus.  Smooth and thick on the palate with light carbonation.

3849,"2008-07-14",5.0,"This is my favorite beer in the world.  I’m from Florida and I order this beer by mail.  It’s very expensive because of the shipping costs but it’s worth it to me.  This is the creamiest thickest IPA I have ever tasted.  The balance between the pale malt and the formidable hops is perfect.  Thick and rich this is almost a double IPA but I like it just the way it is.  I love this beer and it has a certain San Diego hop load that is very similar to Racer 5 by Bear Republic.  I’m guessing that Cascade and Centennial hops are used in this fantastic concoction.  The head is a supremely jagged cloud like affair and is very sticky leaving plenty of lace on my pint glass.  The color is a little darker than most IPAs and I like that.  If you have never had this IPA, I suggest you do whatever it takes to get it, like I do.

A massive thanks to trading partner Brian of West Orange, New Jersey who apparently felt that the really good extras he included with the main part of our trade weren’t enough, so he sent a second box with this gem a week later. Also, this just happens to be my 600th beer rating. 

Appearance: Beautiful reddish-orange color with a medium sized head. The head does disappear rather quickly, leaving little specks of lacing. The head does stick around as a thin film on the top of the beer that creeps just slightly up the sides of the glass. Slight haze and vigorous carbonation. 3.75/5.0. 

Aroma: Very appropriate IPA aroma... floral, citrus and pine hop notes with a sweet background. Not terribly complex, but very pleasant. 4.0/5.0

Taste: Nicely complex taste. It hits me as sweet, bitter, sweet bitter with the sweetness having a honey-like quality juxtaposed with a strong citrus hop bitterness. I am reminded of lemonheads candy. Maybe the slightest vegetal note. Very nice. 4.0/5.0

Mouthfeel: The carbonation gives this a lively feel. Bitterness and sweetness balance fairly well. The beer has a slightly viscous feel and the alcohol is absolutely hidden. 4.5/5.0

Drinkability: Bitter, sour, sweet, but absolutely smooth and approachable. It’s not perfectly balanced, but every aspect of this beer stays relatively in check with the others. It’s not cheap (Brian paid $8.99 for this somewhere in Jersey), but 22 ounces is absolutely no problem, and is a very pleasant experience. 4.5/5.0

Overall: This is a top-notch IPA, in the league of anything Stone, Bell’s or Russian River can produce. A joyful experience, and a worthy 600th rating.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"

3849,"2008-06-28",4.3,"Burnished gold with some hop haze and nice long lasting off white head
Nose of Citrus (grapefruit, tangerine) some resin. With honeyish malt with some alcohol notes as well
Flavor: Really rich complex hop flavor with a big hop bite. Honey, toast, vanilla, tangerine,grapefruit, rind, spice and round out the party.
Palate: Really long lasting, changing flavors from initial burst of malt sweetness to a drying hop finish.
Overall an IPA I have been trying to find for a while and especially being one of the highest rated IPAs. I have to say ""EXCELLENT"" The aroma and flavor seems to have dulled a touch from time and transport.
This comes across almost as a double IPA with its malt and alcohol but the drying finish with honeyish notes is the signature for this one.","USA","luvcasks"

Retention from the head is full throught the lifetime of the glass. Aroma is very nice with citrus (mainly grapefruit) and floral hops galour, a little bit of spiceyness, and some sweet malts and some rich nearly dark fruits in the back. Taste is nice and balanced IPA with a very refreshing hop bitterness in great balance with the sweet malts and alcohol. Finishes with a rich spiceyness that is not too common in basic IPAs.

3849,"2008-05-28",3.9,"(bottle, thanks Bartzilla!) Pours hazy copper-orange with a lasting white head that leaves sticky lacing; a perfect five.  The aroma is just great.  First, I get a big blast of grapefruit, and a cotton candy-like sweetness, followed up by mandarin orange and ambrosia salad.  Some pine and grass emerges as well.  Wow, this is something else.  The taste however, fallls flat.  Theres a little caramel taste in here, with just a weak hop finish.  The complexity that the nose displayed is not exhibited at all in the flavor.  Mouthfeel is medium.  This beer is paradoxical, the aroma is probably the best Ive ever smelled in an IPA, but the flavor is very run of the mill.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

Full on hopped pine resins with a slight grapefruit and rhine character.  Wet forrest flowers with pepper endings demands to be heard too.  The holy of holies?

Awesome aroma of floral hops, tropical fruit, peach, and bright citrus (tangerine, grapefruit).  Flavor marked by zesty grapefruit hops-fresh and spritzy- like a twisting of grapefruit rind on the tongue.  Has a robust hoppy bitterness which is at the same time mellow and smooth.  Clean resiny finish--no astringency.  Nice biscuity malt foundation to support all the hoppy goodness.

3849,"2008-04-29",3.8,"Pours a clear, bright golden with a beautiful thick fluffy head that hangs around for ages. Fantastic lacing and a great looking IPA all the way around.  Big citrus and piny hops in the nose with a pleasant malt aroma in the background. Strong lemon and grapefruit smells on top of the fragrant pine.  Initial bitterness of the piny hop blast almost immediately gives way to the citrus, with lemon zest, oranges, and grapefruits dominating. Very subtle malt background throughout before the pine hop bitterness reenters the fray in the lingering aftertaste. Pretty aggressive but well balanced.  Medium bodied with enough carbonation and bitterness to zing the tongue nicely. Despite the zing, the overall mouthfeel is actually very smooth.  One of the more drinkable IPAs out there and a solid example of a West Coast IPA. This is about as big as you can get without getting into DIPA territory.

A rush of piney and citrusy hop aroma sweeps over you when you crack open this bottle of real ale.  As you pour into your glass the light amber nectar releases carbonation carrying the aroma of a fresh hop field to your nose as you anxiously wait for the white head to settle down to take your first sip.  Intense hop flavor is balanced with a malty sweetness creating a symphony of flavors on the tongue with a dry finish.  Hops are intense throughout the entire experience but no so much that you need a break between quaffs.  Excellent presentation of the sinfully hoppy west coast IPA.","California, USA","yenbrat"

3849,"2008-02-17",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 28, 2009 22oz bottle.   Clear amber with a sticky lasting head that laces.   Big fruity aroma with lots of mango, some grapefruit, pine, and a little caramel.   Some toasty, caramel maltiness with lots of hops over it.   Almost balanced, but the hops are huge and win out with a bitter finish.   Very nicely drinkable, but you can still feel the alcohol.   Medium, clean palate with soft carbonation.   My one hang up is that there is a slight soapy note in the finish that tastes like a weird play between the hops and alcohol.   Hardly distracting, but keeps it from being a perfect IPA for me. (8,4,7,4,15=3.8)
Rerate:   22oz bottle.   I wish they would date these bottles because this cant be too fresh.   Nice peach/grapefruit/pineapple hop aroma, though not incredibly punchy.   Maybe Im just expecting too much though.   Fruity and floral with a resiny-bitter finish that isnt too intense.   Some toasty sweetness up front, but dry and bitter in the finish with almost no alcohol.   Medium bodied with medium carbonation and a nice feel from the bottle conditioning, minus some chunks.   Despite my suspicions that this would be punchier with a fresher bottle, this is quite good.   I really need to find it on tap now.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

A frothy, off-white head settles to a thin layer with a marshy gathering of bubbles towards the center.  Organic splotches of lacing look like cobwebs on the glass.  The aroma is very fresh and fruity, with very well balanced blend of sweet malt and bitter hop character.  Fresh orange juice and grapefruit hops blend well with caramel and lightly buttery toffee.  The flavor follows suit, with incredibly tasty citrus perfectly complimenting the substantial maltiness.  A touch of honey adds a unique sweetness.  Very well balanced.  The body and mouthfeel are on the heavy side of medium and are incredibly smooth.  Very tasty and satisfying.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

The beer was kinda one dimensional, heavy grapefruit...but that ""AleSmith flavor"", which Ive noticed in all of their beers (a biscuity flavor from the yeast maybe?), doesnt fit as well here as in the other styles.

3849,"2008-01-11",4.4,"In short: One of the most intense <8% IPA.  Extremely bitter grapefruit and pine-needles hopping.  Amazing stuff.
How: 22oz bottle from my Secret Festivus.  A million thanks whoever you are.
The look: Clear golden body with a medium beige head
In long: Intense nose of grapefruit with some pineapples and pine-tree.  Taste is just as intense as the nose.  Almost too intense!  The initial attack is smooth and surprisingly sweet.  Not thick caramel-sweet, more like crisp sugary honey/caramel sweetness. But then the intense fruity bitterness kicks-in and is it ever tasty.  Im talking intensely bitter to the point of making faces.  And thats a hop-head talking.  The bitter hops flavours we equally grapefruit and pine-tree seconded by pineapples and citrus.  The more the beer warmed up the more the pine-tree was coming out and it was drying out the beer quite nicely.  More highly drinkable chilled than cold.

The hops are very aromatic in this one - you can practically smell the bottle across the room. It pours a hazy amber with minimal head. First flavor is pine, which dominates, peeling back into a finish that is bittersweet.

Grapefruit, citrus, a touch of pine, and tasty. Just like an IPA should smell. Not as sweet as a double IPA would be which is perfect.

The hops are strong and up front in the flavor also, but they arent as citrusy as they were in the aroma. The hop flavors are more piney which seems to make it more sticky malty. The hop flavor is really clear but not what I expected or prefer in an IPA really. Just personal preference really. Big malt presence and a great amount of bitterness.

On the heavier end of what I would expect in an IPA, but still good. The malty backbone adds body.

Peaches and apricots in the smell.  Strong flavor, quite thick and yummy (with hints of alcohol slightly).  Heavy and strong - but good.  This is warming (almost like whiskey is).

update to rating:
I was a little too excited when posting the above rave, and forgot to include much content.  But what more needs to be said about this one?  Here are some tasting notes anyway: Color is hazy gold, perfect frothy head, lots of little bubbles; aroma of flowers and citrus; this IPA hits your taste buds with a hops blast similar to stepping out of a warm house into an arctic windstorm; bitter citrus, lots of resiny effects that get your saliva glands going; long finish of fresh hops.  Every time I travel out of state I look for Alesmith products and try to smuggle them home.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","blazingspiral"

Knocks you over the head with some bracing hops initially, but the malt kicks in to balance a bit. Its still quite hoppy, though. Lots of grapefruit and pine. Really fresh tasting.

There might be other components in there, but honestly when you dump that much hop-action in there, forget it.  Aftertaste is very hoppy and long lasting.

Amber pour with a huge white meringue like sticky and lasting head.  Smell is sweet fruity hops at first, with some citrusy notes and then hops turn more earthy.  Taste is a quite sharp hoppy bitterness and flavor.  Some light sweetness, but I personally would like to see just a touch more to balance out the big hops.  After pouring the end of the bomber, it clouds up and is a nice hazy amber, and the body seemed to thicken up a bit.  The alcohol is well hidden, and although this isnt one of my top 2 or 3 favorite IPAs its still quite good, strong in hop flavor, and one worth trying.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"

Once the beer hit my tastebuds it was over. Im used to solid WC IPAs but this was clearly a breed apart.

Flavor was a bit subtle and subdued compared to many IPAs that Ive sampled. The taste experience starts with dry hazelnuts and walnuts in the forefront, oranges, pine and grapefruit fill in the edges, and biter hops and clean malts bring up the rear.

Ive been looking forward to drinking some AleSmith IPA. Finally getting my chance tonight. An average pour produced a half glass full of head. Letting it die down a little the head became very dense and craggy leaving big chunky lacing down the glass. The body has a very mild chill haze with few tiny carbonation bubbles swirling throughout. The body has a slight orange tint along the lines of iced tea. Very nice looking beer.

Very enjoyable aroma with a big but not overpowering pine needle nose. As it warms grapefruit rind comes forward. Biscuity malt lingers in the background and compliments the pine nicely. Mild alcohol vapors rise through and add a spicy note.

More caramel malt in the flavor than the biscuity malt that was in the aroma. The biscuity malt is there but takes a back seat to the caramel. The main flavor component is the hops, just like any good IPAs main characteristic is. Pine oils coat the tongue and linger on after the malt presence fades. As this beer warms the grapefruit becomes more pronounced. Again, very mild alcohol adds a welcomed spiciness. Very solid. 

The mouthfeel is spot on. Medium body with a creamy airy texture. Nice bitterness on the swallow in the back of the throat. Exactly as I would want a good IPA to feel like.

Highly drinkable. In no way over the top which hurts the drinkability of other IPAs. Somewhat balanced but leaning toward the hops. After every sip you immediately want another.

A solid IPA from AleSmith. Perfect example of a left coast IPA. My first foray into AleSmith beers and it definately wont be my last. I just need to figure out how to get more.

It leaves a lace like those little doilies your grandma put under her imitation Ming vase.  It smells like hop resin and citrus.  The nose is quite bitter and almost burns a little.  Just smelling this gem makes my mouth water.  The first sip slides down the groove in the center of your tongue like a thief gliding, unseen down an alleyway.  When it gets to the big buds on the back side of your mouth it splashes like a flood to the sides of your tongue where suddenly your mouth lights up in happy ecstasy.  The corners of your lips curl up slightly and your eyes narrow.  Ah!  Hops and grapefruit permeate the flavor.  On the next swallow you hold the beer in your cheeks and roll your tongue around in a bath of Romanesque indulgence.  A slight pine wood flavor can be detected.  After drink thereafter requires that you sniff the glass as you raise it to your lips in a passion of foreplay.  The body does this involuntarily.  As the beer warms up it gains body and dimension, becoming fuller and more complex.  Images of small hexagonal beer molecules dance in your head like sugarplums on Christmas Eve.  The stratus-like lacing hides the beer from the Budweiser fan sitting across from you at the table.  He doesnt even understand and you have no way to explain it to him.

3849,"2007-06-27",3.9,"22 oz bottle. Poured a clear dark orange color. Head was off white, thick, creamy, and left some lace on the glass as I drained it. Smelled of grapefruit, pine resin, and cotton candy. Flavor was a nice mixture of toffe and grapefruity hops. The body was a bit lighter than I had expected and there was only mild hop bitterness.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"
3849,"2007-06-18",4.1,"Deep golden/light orange pour with plenty of carbonation to retain a light beige head. The aroma is almost entirely hops that release gentle but focused and hearty notes of grapefruit, tangerine, orange and a hefty swath of pine that cuts a path through all the aforementioned citrus and gives the nose a pleasant earthy feel. Malt is evident, but just barely. Alcohol is well concealed. The flavor is wonderful and very stimulating. More hops and light toasted grains. Light sweetness and heavy bitterness. Acidity is mild and the taste is very green. The mouthfeel is very creamy and appropriately carbonated, light to medium bodied. Its incredibly smooth, the strongest facet of the entire experience. The finish is bone dry, crisp and clean, with acidic notes lingering and lightly cutting into the tongue. An exceptional IPA, no surprise at all.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Taste is more of the hops, especially the grapefruit all nicely balanced with the malt backbone.  The finish is a nice bit of sourness to it.

The initial aroma was a blast of citrus that smelled like fresh-squeezed orange juice.  Butter and caramel as well as pine and floral hops are noted as well.  The flavor was malt and citrus up front and pine bringing down the hop hammer in the back.  Expectedly succinct finish.  Nice, medium bodied mouthfeel.  Very good.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","Soonah"
3849,"2007-06-10",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 21, 2008 Wow. The most amazing IPA that I have had to date.  Pours a light, fluffy, golden color with an off-white head.  Taste is of soft passion fruit and a little bit of pine.  A very transitional IPA that goes from juicy hops to a sweet malt, back to a slightly pine hop bitterness. Nearly perfect IPA.
---re-rate---
Another fresh bottle from Joey at South Bay.  
Well, this one has the same passionfruit aroma with lots of citrus and a touch of alcohol kick to it to boot.
Taste is a lot more caramel and punchy fruit, but the fruit/hop note is subdued by the alcohol and bitterness until the very end, when it finishes creamy and smooth. 
I don’t think I’ll change my rating too much at this point.  I mean, it is an IPA.  
Definitely a lot of citrus and pine behind the passion fruit.

Like many IPAs the piney scent is there, but not overpowering. Before I drank this I downed a NXNW Kodiak IPA, which I had aged for little over a month, and the piney scent of that was much stronger. The AleSmith was a great combination of grapefruit, nectarine, orange cream, and malty hop. The finish isnt long enough when it comes to something as satisfying in the mouth as this.

3849,"2007-04-18",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 13, 2009 Bottle at Chris O bottlefest 2007.  Great grapefruity aroma with citrus and tangerine.  One of the best aromas Ive had on a beer.  In mouth, fantastic, but harsh on finish.  So much tangerine, its pretty awesome as the label says, but it fades as a beer towards the end. 4.3/5.  Bottle from BeerMerchants.com Feb 2009.  I agree with my rating about the aroma, the hops attack you even before they are out of the bottle, but it really is a sublime hop aroma.  Not harsh, just creamy and floral and flowery and full of lychee.  Up against Stone Ruination, its hard to call, but nice to be given the chance.  THis is more floral on the hop, almost more delicate if that can makes sense for such a hugely hoppy beer.  Is it worth £11?  Yes.  Definitely, better than most wines of the same price.   I certainly cant rate it any lower than Ruination.  The more I drink it the more I like it, or is that the more I drink it, the more drunk I get?  Along with the Speedway, this is a world class beer.  Big hop without being harsh, unbelievably huge but subtle at the same time.  Really quite an experience.  You really do feel that this is an event rather than a beer.   Really quite exceptional.  Just about flawless in terms of an ipa from the West Coast.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

3849,"2007-04-01",4.2,"22, thanks to the kind hand of BitBucket. Towering moussy tan head over a hazy orange body. Gorgeous, but prepare to sit around for a while while the head settles to clingy, somewhat flotsamy foam. Big candied fruit nose--lots of sweet citrus knocking around, and some of them smell like theyve dusted in powdered sugar for a while. Theres some caramel, maybe a hint of butterscotch in there to remind you that this beer does not consist entirely of boiled hops. Think of these malt notes as a hostage photo; theyre polaroids of the barley taken with the San Diego Union Tribune, brew day edition. Cause this beers all about the hops. Tangy citrus throughout the attack, mid-palate, and finish. Incredibly smooth and drinkable, and the 7.25% was a shocking number, at least a good point higher than I suspected. They say the local price on the bombers is reasonable. Other than the abv this beer screams sessionability in every way. Complex, satisfying, interesting, refreshing, not at all in danger of growing repetitive...and its not available here and it gets you too drunk.

Slightly opaque coppery colour with tight rocky white head that when deflated leaves frothy lacing. Noticeable caramel malt sweetness and rose petal and orange flavours counter the piney fresh green hops and biting bitterness that is softened by the exquisitely gentle mouthfeel.

Pours a medium orange-copper color, effervescent, boldly colored; fluffy, textured off-white head with great retention and lacing that stick; beautiful pour. Lots of pine in the aroma, to the degree of being beautifully pungent and dank; followed by plenty of citrus: grapefruit and oranges; just a gorgeously presented tart note from the grapefruit; quiet, sufficient malt character is barely of any consequence; this is all dense, varied hop character. Medium-to-full body: following the aroma, theres a whole lot o grapefruit, pine, and citrus here; not quite the tartness suggested by the aroma, but certainly present; the malt character appears as a basic bready and toasty malt sweetness at the core, with hints of honey and vanilla; non-astringent hop character, nicely dank and resiny - this is just a lovely IPA, and Im glad to finally revisit a fresh bottle. Great, multifaceted hop character with that soft vanilla note at the core. Lengthy, dry finish: citrus, hints of grapefruit, nicely toasty and crisp ending.

22oz bottle, courtesy of Naven??  Its been a while, and I put one of these aside in the hopes that it would carbonate more, to no avail.  Pours a cloudy, dark pink-grapefruit appearance; minimal head formation.  Huge, chewy aroma, showing oranges and grapefruit and maple syrup.  Full, chewy mouthfeel: light carbonation; lots of grapefruit and tropical fruit hops; plenty of resiny chewiness; backed up by a prominent wet-malt and vanilla character; but its really just an under-carbonated and chewy mess.  Ive had three bottles over the last couple months, and Ive not really enjoyed any of them.  Medium, sugary finish.  Tasty, but this just seems thrown together.

Flavor of pine, grapefruit, caramel, nuts, vanilla and an excellent hop flavor and bitterness.  Yet this still has enough caramel malt to balance it beautifully.

3849,"2007-02-15",4.0,"Just pouring this brew on this brew into a glass tells most of the story. It fills the room with a beautiful citrus aroma. I swear I have never nosed an IPA with so much aroma, hell I did not know an IPA could have so much aroma. I didnt want to keep the glass down, and continue to extract the various layers of essence bursting out of the glass. I want to give it an 11 on 10 on aroma. On taste, my first impressions were brilliant - crisp, fruity, hoppy and variantly complex. However the finish was another story. After being uplifted with an out-worldly experience, you are presented with an overly hoppy, cloying bitter finish that disappoints. I did not know an American micro was able to produce such a nose and such subtle brilliance. But as usual the finish is that of an overly excited, overly done, American micro. I was so impressed by this brew initially, that Im going to humbly ask Alesmith to please reduce that hoppy cloying bitterness, you are destroying the one beer that has the potential to be the quintessential example for what American micros are capable of.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","StateofTrance"

2007 Bottle- Fresh.  Since my first encounter with this delicious beer back in January, Ive been remembering how fresh and exciting it was to drink.  Ive been looking forward to our next encounter with some apprehension.  Im afraid it will fail to live up to the first experience.  Here goes...
Pour is a dark melon/amber color with a head of white lace. The aroma is the beautiful mix of hops and malt that I remember although this time Im not detecting the same diversity of aromas I experienced the first time around.  The hops are spicy and citric, the malts are Caramely and smooth.  As it pours over my tongue I get the spicy hops and then as it falls to the sides of my tongue and the back it is the sweet malts that show themselves.  Still a true champion of the style.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","shadey"
3849,"2007-01-16",4.6,"The aroma was a little weak for the wonderful experiences in appearance, flavor, and palate.  This has to be one of the best IPAs ever made.

The alcohol is detectable while in the mouth and the carbonation is a little, just a little, too present.  Yum!  Thanks Bartzilla.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","GaltScat"

3849,"2006-11-10",4.3,"22oz bottle:  the sound made upon opening  think and the little head formed by a vigorous pour makes me think that my bottle flat/under carbonated.  pours a brilliant hazy honey color with very little head.  aroma is stong of grapefruit and pine.  maybe some lemon and orange with just a tinge of malt.  the mouth feels is less carbonated that what i am used, but i like it.  i do think that mine is some how under carbonated.  flavor is amazing though.  tons of grapfruit and pine with hints of caramel, peaches and a tiny bit of vanilla.   very balacned and very drinkable.  i hope my other bottles dont have the same carbonation problem.","West Chester, Ohio, USA","tobias"

Hazy orange/copper pour with a modest but sturdy off-white head and good lacing.  Typically floral/fuity/piney hop aroma for a top tier west coast IPA with consistant flavors.  A touch of brown sugar, peaches and plenty of malt sweetness in the flavors as well.  Rich mouthfeel and a brisk bitter finish with hints of vanilla at the end.  A great IPA from a region seemingly crowded with fantastic offerings.","Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA","GuilTTy"

Caramel malts, some earthiness, some wet hops and pine hop bitterness. Maybe what Im tasting is hop flavor since the bitterness is on the light side. Finally trying a fresh bottel of this. Thank you Alesmith for putting dates on the bottle. This fresh bottle is just yummy with crisp tangerine, dank spicy onion, some shallot and light floral hops around the edges.

3849,"2006-09-12",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2007 Tasted with OhioGuzzler and side-by-side with Stone Ruination IPA...  The AleSmith IPA is an orange/copper color (just slightly darker than the Stone Ruination IPA).  Mild carbonation and a foamy plale yellow head.  Aroma is sweet like syrup with a tinge of yeast and alcohol aged candied fruit.  Flavor is sweet and malty with a really nice apricot finish.  The hop flavor and bitterness gradually amplifies through the finish and then lingers away with the wonderful apricot flavor.  Smooth on the tongue with just enough thickness.  The hop profile on this one is quite different than most IPAs is it doesnt really just out right away in either the aroma or flavor.  This IPA seems more like a really nice strong ale or barley wine.   I think this beer might have been aging in the bottle for awhile, attributing to its smooth sweetness and wonderfully balanced flavors.  I wish this IPA was more widely available in the area as it is so good!  I love the pronounced apricot flavor and finish.

Im using a tulip glass and the head is quite large and lasting, with little bit of lacing.  Delicous mouthwatering citrus fruity aroma.  Tastes better than the aroma.

Substantial citrusy and spicy aroma with a backgrond of some sweet caramel. Rich, smooth mouthfeel with medium bodythat leaves a rsinous coating. The carbonatin is surprisingly light given the huge head. The flavor starts off with a light maltysweetness, but is soon replaced by the bitterness of peppery spice and grapefruit. A long lightly bitter finish brings everything to a satisfying end. I was expecting this to be overrated, but it certainly lives up to its well deserved reputation.

Flavor is citrus, caramel and delightful sweetness. Yum. Update 5/19/9: On tap at the Local in SD. Pours deep dark gold to borderline amber with a thick white head that holds on but settles to a ""hill and valley"" sheen. Unfortunately, they served this in an iced glass. At arctic temperatures, the aroma still manages to generate a candy malt hoppy orange scent. Has a mango and pineapple sweetness as its first big flavor. The palate is thick and slick.

Smell was mostly hops, but a small amount of malt sweetness sneaks through. Taste was citrus and pine followed by a hint of alcohol. Finish is very winelike.

3849,"2006-06-03",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2007 Poured an amber color with a huge huge head that was impressive, sustained itself well, and laced well. The aroma was strong and hoppy (some pine) and grapefruit. Flavor was much of the same with a not too sweet malt base. I enjoyed this one, but have a hard time distinguishing the better IPAs from one another. Re-rate: 6/26/06, similar experience, although the maltiness was a bit rich and bitter, some citrus rinds in there. A slightly off spicey and peppery type flavor (their yeast?) in the aftertaste. Bordered on a chemical type flavor. Pushed the higher malty and alcohol levels of a dIPA, but good stuff, nonetheless. Re-rate, 12/07: Full malt body, darned bitter finish, a darned fine IPA, but a little over the top for my top likings. Spicey/peppery aspects noted by me again, definitely distinctive if you get it at the right temperature.","","User37895"

Piney, sweet citric hempy caramel goodies present in the nose.  Very west-coast and very aromatic.  Smells great.  Mildly hazy copper color with a big, long-lasting frothy off-white head and attractive lacing.  Starts chewy, malty, caramelly and roasted.  Turns a bit more hopped and bitter with some piney and earthy notes along with mild hemp flavors.  A very sticky, chewy IPA that has the scales tipped a bit too far in favor of the malts.

Poured into an English pint, light amber, slight dry hop haze with a billowing white head that lasted the entire time I was drinking this beer.  Im getting all facets of hop aroma here.  Citurs, spice, earth, and flowers are all in line. Some nice honey aroma works its way through to represent the malt.  Again a quality blend of hop flavor takes over as I drink also.  Stong bitterness is sure to get your attention.  Very resinous, and stinky from the lips to the tonsils.  Reminds me of a wannabe Racer 5.

Although this is a typical west coast hop monster, the semi-sweet malt profile comes through nicely in the flavor department balancing impeccably with the big, bitter hop notes.

3849,"2006-03-11",4.3,"hello and welcome to our tour; my name is winston hogfeller the third, your guide.  of course were here to explore and appreciate this grand edifice of brewing: the renouned castle alesmith ipa. so if everyone is quite ready, well begin. approaching, youll notice that the bottle itself has a minimalist facade, with its plain white and strictly utilitarian block letters forged in the helvetica font from the mountains of switzerland. the brooding exterior is highly misleading, even paradoxical.  i would advise here only cursory photography to save your film for the famous and expansive pour. indeed, here it comes, with trumpets, banners and royal pomp (much gasping ascending to spontaneous applause). please stand back, the foam will bloom to extraordinary heights. yes there it is in the goblet! (sound of many cameras shooting).  an inverted rotunda after the fashion of st. peters: interlocking panels of pure amber and aztec gold with enormous and flamboyant flying buttresses of foam-- at once seemingly snatched from and mingling with the clouds and heavens. but wait! do look more closely overhead and observe the exquisite lacing, an almost dizzying filigree of ivory, and notice as well the more subtle inlay of tiny gems of particulate matter throughout the interior. they do seem to defy gravity. lets move along to the aroma, and here youre entering a lush emerald city of green hops. the architect had a penchant obviously for hops, and created the perfect halls and grottos to serve up whatever state banquet was called for, done in the verdant tones of piney saw dust, green banana peel, sage, toffee and gingersnap. during this period in the evolution of the great american lupulin palaces of course there was incredible competition among designers to create this kind of rococo stylistic hyperbole. and thats seen here in the flavor, where the grand design comes to fruition. the great expense of the tonnage of hops is quite immeasurable, all the more remarkable in that it was done by hand-- and by artisans receiving but modest remuneration. on your left are orchard fruits, delicately wrought, and on your right, the bold imperial bitters in full regalia. now, watch your head as we descend into the wet catacombs of full body, carved out of living malts, structurally immense with pillars of caramel under arcs of subtle honey sweetness. walk this way please, stay together everyone. finally, after gurgling along a hop ""randall"" aqueduct spanning the entire grounds, the flavor drops at last into this splendid courtyard fountain. i say. just remarkable i think youll agree. this concludes our tour, thank you, and visitors are now free to relax in the hospitality area where everyone will receive a very handsome complimentary buzz.

Full and seductive flavors similar to the nose... freshly-squeezed grapefruit, Spruce needles, smooth caramel, and mild warmth from the alcohol.

Not over-the-top in anything, just a very clean and crisp flavor without flaws.  No indication on the flavor that this is over 7% ABV.

I dont know the hops used but they show up in the nose too, sugary grass and other goodies. Strong malt sweetness that surprises me then I taste the hops. Which are grassy and slick. I expected this to be over the top smack you in the face hop juice, but it is an easy drinking balanced beer that is easy to enjoy. A bit more malt flavor than I expected from an IPA from the west coast but not bad at all. There is something subverting this and it is a tannic unsweet iced tea flavor in the finish. The sweet graham cracker and marshmallow flavor is nice but I dont like the hop profile much.  Grassy peanut hop flavor that is not quite my cup o tea. A touch of pine is there also but it doesnt please me that much.  A nice pleasant beer nonetheless.

The palate is sticky, almost gooey with luscious resin.  Its medium-full and rather coating for an ipa with lingering alcohol in the nose.  Flavor is bolstered by more bitterness and grapefruit pith than bargained for, none of it unwelcome, however theres some bready acidity that feels awkward.

3849,"2006-01-12",4.4,"(22 oz bottle: $3.39 at BevMo in La Jolla, CA) I decided to do a rerate on this beer, just to see if I liked it any more than I did 13 months ago, when I thought it was quite good but didnt love it.  The BevMo I work at just got this in today, and it was still cold when I was replentishing the empty AleSmith IPA shelf space, so I put one in the cooler for myself to drink tonight (ah, the single best benefit of working at a retail liquor store!).  And my God, Im now convinced that I must have rated a bottle that was not in tip-top shape because this beer is so freaking fresh and delicious, I have to think it was bottled within the last week.  Frankly, this beer is more flavorful, supremely malty and intensely hoppy than many Imperial IPAs Ive tasted.  Huge citrus hoppiness tastes exceptionally fresh and provides a very strong bitterness from sip to finish, but the sweet malts just laugh out loud at the thought of playing second fiddle.  As hoppy as this beer is, its still extremely well balanced by the sweet malt, tasty fruitiness and tea-like herbal character.  Full bodied, very coating on the palate, bordering on sticky.  Solid carbonation and crisp hoppiness keep the palate refreshed.  Golden amber in color with modest haze from bottle conditioning.  The off-white head is very active on the pour, rising to probably an inch and a half, and thats with a reasonably careful pour.  Retention is magnificent, never fading below a quarter inch, and lacing decorates much of the glass in large, dense and thick patches.  With all the incredible beers AleSmith puts out in their 750 ml bottles, its easy to overlook their ""ordinary"" beers in bombers, but the IPA is just incredible.  Has to be one of the very best IPAs in the world!!","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Nice balance in this, but not a really overpowering, knock the hell out of you beer that I expected from the ratings that I read.  Dont get me wrong, this is a good beer, but the Yulesmith from Alesmith kicks it in the butt!  I liked this as it had a nice warm mouthfeel with decent body and nice carbonation.

I also had a bottle of it about 4 months ago, but I didnt want to review that one as it was almost syrupy and quite resinous/pine sappy.  Even the 4 months of aging in my refridgerator has helped mellow this one out.  Dont get me wrong, its well malted, but it was just too syrupy and sweet with too much acid when fresh.  Pours a deep, golden-amber, kind of a canteloupe melon color, though quite brilliant with plenty of bottle conditioned bubbles creating a dense and creamy large off-white head that is retained at cover and laces lightly.  Aroma has tons of grapefruit, pine resin and plenty of floral, green hop freshness.  Light juicy fruits apparent as well.  Hints of honey and caramel in the background create a well-balanced and highly aromatic aroma.  Flavor begins with plenty of pine resin, oranges, toasted malt notes, and a sweet caramel-chocolate note.  Kind of like the orange flavored chocolate I had for breakfast.  Herbs and leafy green hops, with a high amount of bitterness.  Spectacular mouthfeel, creamy through and through, with tight carbonation and a chewy substantiality to the body.  Alcohol is not apparent.  High amount of yeast drying on the very end (end of bottle) and a moderate amount of acidity lingers on the palate, but so does plenty of citric hop flavor and light melanoidins.

Initial flavour of really thick malt - again its very fresh, fairly sweet, caramelly, buttery with a bit of toastiness at the end as it gives way to an earthy, vegetal, artichokey hop flavour and a good clean bitterness. Its a touch worty and theres a bit of alcohol late. Tastes a bit hoppier with the yeast in the glass. Its a lot like Emersons APA only this tastes fresher, though I still cant help but feel that the hop character is a little muted. Its also too thick and malty to be really drinkable. Really good stuff, but it needs more hops (with less vegetabley flavour) to be my ultimate IPA.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

I had a rough day and this aroma alone relieved the stress of it (new slogan ""Alesmith IPA: Relieves Stress"" could work I think).  Fresh and pine like as well.  Dark yellow pour, thick like head (the beer looks thin).  Creamy, frothy mouthfeel.  Wonderful hop taste, with more hints of orange.  I wish it had just a tad more body, but that is getting pretty picky.  A wonderful IPA, thank you Harry!","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"
3849,"2005-09-04",4.1,"Poured a hazy orange with a small long lasting off-white head.  Aroma of citrusy and piney hops hit first with a good amount of sweet malt underneath.  Caramel and dough.  Flavor of caramel, no hops, no caramel, no hops.  Flavor goes back and forth malt to hops all the way through the long finish.  The tail is all hops and nice warmth.  Medium to full body.  This has everything.  Great aroma, great flavor, great balance, and great mouthfeel.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"

3849,"2005-08-25",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2007 December 2006. New Years Eve, shared with Mabel, bottle courtesy of HogtownHarry. Orangey amber body with a big fluffy off white head (4+). Massive citrus aroma of grapefruit, tangerines, and lemon seeds. Flavour is dominated by citrusy hops, grapefruit, with light notes of resin. Tart lemon and citrus rind in the finish lingers. Malt is an afterthought - I remember there being more but perhaps I am mistaken. Alcohol starts to become a bit noticable as it gets warm (8+) Slightly more full than average palate is just right for the beer. Awesome! Just a touch more malt would make this damn near perfect for my tastebuds. 10/4+/8+/4/18-19 - 4.6<P>

August 2005. Bottle. Orange body with a good size bubbly white head. Big pine resin hops dominate the aroma with mildly leafy notes as well. Quite bitter with some malt shyly offering support. Lots of chewy resin throughout. Barely noticeable lemon in both the start and finish.  Medium body is awesome on the tongue. Hoppy hand lingers in its grasp on the back of your throat. Delicious!

3849,"2005-07-21",4.0,"Transparent gold in color with some tiny cloistered bubble colonies breaking everywhere at the surface - its like looking down into a volcano.  Nice nectarine, grapefruit and apricot aroma.  Flavor leads in as crisp with hops placating the palate from the get-go.  A hops crescendo rises to a bitter peak and is joined by just malt support.  Some discernable alcohol, along with elements of papaya, sweet dried oranges and nectarines, and sugar-sprinkled grapefruit help to round out the flavor sequence.  Each first sip of each pour (about 4 oz. at a time) would hit like acupuncture on the tongue, but the sips at the end of each pour would be losing the initial liveliness of the carbonation.  Finishes with a slight hint of the bitterness displayed, transitioning into a honeydew aftertaste.  Overall, a solid IPA.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

3849,"2005-05-05",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2006 Pours a golden orange color. A bit hazy with a light white head.  Citrus hops (primarily grapefruit and citrus peal) mixed with fresh grain highlights from the malt make the  aroma most enjoyable and fresh.  The taste is very bitter.  Strong grapefruit is present throughout as is a citrus peal taste towards the end and during the after taste (which lingers long).  Carrying this along is some greenish grain (hay comes to mind).  The body is crisp and smooth.  Moderate carbonation.  Not too bad but not my favorite.  

Chalk this up to changing palet I suppose.  Retried at the 2nd anual ides of March beer tasting at my house (3-18-06).  Noted a color difference this time around that I described as hazy onion skin. No change score.  Aroma notes are surprisingly similar though I noted some grassyness and not grapefruit.  Still enjoyable but more balanced than I noted before.  The taste is what really changed for me.  Much more balanced than I noted before.  Malty chewy caramel with a citrus pine hop blend that was in no way over the top.  Great aftertaste of malty caramel sweetness (worth of 2 more taste points).  Creamy sticky mouth feel (impoves the palate rating one point). Overall, Im looking at a 4 here minimum.

3849,"2005-02-03",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2005  This is the best IPA I have ever had.  Pours a cloudy orange with a creamy head with great lacing.  The lacing is quite surprising considering it is not a Double IPA.  The the aroma has so much malt in it that you have to give it a 10.  There is also some citrus, graitfruit and a very sweet smell which I cant quite put my finger on.  The same smell is apparent in the Old Numbskull.  The taste is to die for in an IPA.  It has graitfruit, citrus and a lot of hops.  Plus some hard liquor which I am unfamilar with.  The sweetness is great with this brewery.  The Palate is far better then any IPA I have ever had.  I wasnt expecting this beer to be this spectacular.  I never knew that an IPA could be this great.  Im really glad I ordered this.  It was worth it.","Princeton, New Jersey, USA","wnhay"

3849,"2005-01-29",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2005 GABF and from a bottle at my cousins house, 2004.  Damn solid IPA.  Creamier than I would expect in the mouthfeel, this still boasted a robust fruity hops that was crisp but not bitter.  All the wonders of the flavor (hops, melons) were present in the nose, as was a slight bready malt which came back to me on the finish.  Good beer.  Re-Rate: on cask at the Real Ale Festival, June 2005.  It was less impressive than I remembered.  I think this is definitely better out of the bottle.  Still very balanced, but everything was underwhelming.  Ive adjusted the overall down a couple points in consequence.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

It has a definite spicy kick to it with a slight sweet malt in there as well. Very nice flavor to it, complex and lots to sort out.

3849,"2004-09-09",3.6,"Orange amber with a fine haze of carbonation blossoming into an eighth inch of creamy white head. Nose is hoppy, very earthy, with a note of pine and hint of musty wood. Medium bodied and not the least bit sticky, aggressive carbonation leads to a decrease in perceived thickness; it can almost come across as watery at times. A little burn here and there from the alcohol at only 7.25% detracts a bit from the presentation. Definitely a hop monster but the hops lean to an earhy pine bitterness rather than the vibrant citric or floral aroma I prefer. Slightly lacking in malt depth. Much better as it warms. At 55 degrees F, I would have given this around a 3.2.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Big coniferous seeds in the forms of C-hops make the malt appear very subdued. Taste is fresh and rather complex for the style. Orange skin, earth, and piney bitterness. Finish is long, hoppy, very dry, green, but perhaps a bit too alcoholic for its relatively low strenght. Hoppy all the way through, no mistakes about it.

Massive aroma of fresh spruce needles, apricots and grapefruit, both pungent and fresh; rapturous.  Mouthpuckering initially, a powerful citrusy bitterness carries through all the way to the end, juicy and fruity, tart and strongly carbonated; quite full-bodied, perhaps a bit much to be refreshing -- this is a sipping IPA, despite the 22 ounces.  Doesnt displace Stone at the top of my IPA list, as its just a bit too funky and heavy for me, but memorable and wonderful in its own right.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

When poured into my usual pint glass, it had an orange amber colored body with a 2-inch thick beige head and a lively natural carbonation.  Head retention was excellent and there was a ton of lace left all around as the beer went down.  Aroma was assertive with floral hops dominating the bouquet.  The taste was a bit brash with a strong alcohol presence, which was not quite hidden under the hops as it should be.  There were notes of citrus on the palette, but these were quite subdued.  The hop bitterness was also relatively low; however they added a good deal of spicy character to the mix.  The mouthfeel was appropriately dry and creamy for the style.

Pine flavors linger above a strongly bitter, somewhat ashy and dry finish.  As with their Extra Pale Ale, this beer hides the malt, although what is there is clean and sweet, with a roundish front - but the hop resins dominate quickly and coat the tongue.

Chunky lacing on modest, beige head that dissipates.  Lovely, strong, full aroma of honey malts with rounded hop depth.  Syrupy.  Taste is straight chewy hops and resin, with a subtly sweet outline (yes, it is a bit like corn) and a hint of caramel malt.  Tiny bit of citrus and some pine that mostly shows up in the peppery finish.  Somewhat drying in the mouth.  Very full body for an IPA with nice, creamy texture and just enough hop bite.

Well this is a major disappointment.  Upon first opening a corn aroma.  Slightly hazy bronze color.  The taste does not get any better or does anything tho confirm the aroma is wrong, weak body and corn taste.

Bittering hops too, of course.  The balanced flavors and smooth mouthfeel really come together well on this beer.  Your tongue salivates when first meeting the beer, the start has citrus tartness and caramel sweetness (credit to Indra for that bit).  The finish is piney with a touch of pepper.  My only detraction is a heavy plum taste present throughout - it serves to bring down the bright hoppy flavors.  A fantastic IPA!  They're not trying to knock you on your ass with hops here, they've made a balanced hoppy brew.

3849,"2004-01-05",4.3,"First of all this was one of the coolest brewers I've ever met. He spent about an hour with us out of towners (me and my fiancee) and we sampled everything he offered us and bought a whole bunch to. This pours a deep unfiltered amber and it's head is a masterpiece in and of itself, dense and creamy. It has the best aroma of any beer ever.(PERIOD) The initial shock is that with all the hop, grapefruity, piney aromas, this beer is not excessively bitter. Now don't get me wrong, this IPA would still get a fizzy-yellow-bland beer drinker to shit a brick but when compared with other fine IPAs, this is tame in bitterness,...and bitterness alone. Man is there some amazing hop flavors buried in this beer. For all you homebrewers out there, he said that he used the equivelant of 8 oz. of dry hops per 5 gallons. WOW!

Flavors are catty as well with lots of tropical notes but has a green apple type flavor as well.  seems like the beer is not very well put together.  wow how my palate has changed.  the palate is terribly astringent with a palate ripping carbonation.  maybe this beer is old?  i dropped my score down almost a whole point!

Smell initially reminded me of a junior Dreadnaught. Aroma notes include prominent grapefruit, yeasty musk, and something distinctly savory and nutty akin to peanuts. The nuttiness comes out in the flavor as well and reminds me of really good cashew butter. I think this property is coming from the hops.

The aroma definitely tells you that this beer is going to focus on the hops, I get notes of apricot and a pungent hoppiness.  The apricot is the strongest aroma component, I like it.  The apricot translates to the taste of the beer, it adds a bit of a fruity backdrop that interacts with the fruitiness from the ale yeast.  A nice hop bit in the finish, followed by a clinging bitterness as a reminder of the beer that was just on my tongue.

Smell is quite a nice hop nose, sweeter pine sense thats bitterly smooth, a touch floral and spiced over a nice toasty caramel malt backbone. Taste is lovely, smooth, soft and rounded, balanced well, nothing overwhelming in the hops, bitterness in check by alot, but whats there is loaded full with nice soft sweet pine, some fresh floral hop hints, caramel malts dotted in the backing thats soft as well. the softness really stands out favorably, I liked it alot. I'm betting its a dried and fresh hop ale variant. Not such a 'in your face' IPA, a simple & welcome surprise and something I find now having had a few Alesmith brews that is something in character that seems to stand out for me in their brews. Feel is soft and pleasant, nearly full, super smooth, nothing harsh here, lingering of bitterness is shorter then most but seems to fit with this one. A bit tamer then the Yulesmith, but nearly the same in every aspect of softness and drinkablity. The softness makes for very easy drinkin'! The bomber was gone in no time.

Slightly sweet, but also showing alcoholic notes. Aftertaste displays a strong citrus qualities as well as a flavourful malt to balance out the hops.

This beer does not contain notes of Grapefruit but it freaking plays a symphony of it, huge citric presence with big maltyness to help the balance. This brew has the feel of cask aging, although it never was. Good beer but a bit over the top for the standard IPA.

Mouthfeel was terrific - seemingly light on texture, but hammered the palate at the same time. When caramel malt and citrus/floral hops combine like this, as with the Numbskull, I am reminded of Earl Grey tea for some reason. Nice sampling of Alesmiths - can't wait to try to Speedway!!!","Florida, USA","BeanDip"
3849,"2003-10-09",4.3,"First impression: aroma similar to arrogant bastard. Taste too, yet not as aggressive. The bitterness doesn't linger on tongue as long. Aroma is piney and slightly citrusy. Palate is awesome. Real tight carbonation, smooth, rich. Aftertaste is pretty slight. Only a fresh, piney hop taste lingers a bit. I enjoyed the 7.2 alc percentage. It added nice warmth halfway through the 22 ozer. Drink this beer. Long live IPA's.","Redondo Beach, California, USA","drinkbeer"
3849,"2003-10-03",4.8,"Wow, this is a top-shelf IPA.  Decent head but tons of lacing, even in the bottle.  Beautful, almost clear light auburn color.  Mouthfeel is incredible, smooth and velvety.  The hops are there ale the way through.  Lovely hoppy floral aroma, great piney/citrus flavor, with a crisp hop finish.  Outstanding ale!!","Rochester, New York, USA","JahNoth"

3849,"2003-09-28",4.7,"Brilliant copper colored beer, topped by a vanilla colored head that lasts an exceptionally long time. After the head fades to a thick rocky layer of foam, a sweet floral aroma becomes more evident. Very nice aroma. Wow, the taste is truly phenomenal, with a combination of malty sweetness, and hops so strong they seem to be both sweet and bitter all at once. Then comes the finish. The flavors seem to completely vanish, but then a slight piney bitterness is noticed lurking around, dragging a wisp of sweetness around with it. Mouthfeel is very solid, and this beer seems to just slide down the throat.","McMurray, Pennsylvania, USA","aaronh"
3849,"2003-09-21",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 27, 2003 22oz bottle  Pours a light amber with copper edges. Clarity is quite good, with lots of little bubbles from the carbonation. It's light tan head is around an inch thick and fades a bit in the middle, leaving huge clumps. Adding the yeast sediment darkens the brew considerably and leaves large chunks in the bottom of my glass. Phenomenol lacing of the glass.  Hoppy as all hell with a huge fruitiness. The one fruit that stands out the most to me is apricots...the aroma just screams apricots! There's a touch of malt underneath that is both mildly sweet and bready. Hint of vanilla... Great aroma!  Full flavored with tons of hop goodness! There's a nice malt background, but this one is all about the hops. Lots of pine, citrus, and fruit flavors meld together perfectly in one of the best IPA's I've ever encountered. There's a touch of an alcohol taste, but it stays in the background where it belongs. Adding the yeast sediment adds another dimension to the already great flavor.  Medium in body with a soft mouthfeel that thickens towards the bottom of the bottle. The yeast yields a creamier, more rounded feel on the palate. Gotta love that bottle-conditioning!  A world-class IPA.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MarkR"

3849,"2003-09-09",4.1,"Golden hue with a nice thick white head and excellent lacing. Aroma is a major resin hop rush but was able to detect some buttery and malty notes too. The taste was smoother than expected, very balanced between the hops and malts. Nice fruity undertone. The finish is woody dry and bitter, has expected. The mouthfeel is lively as not as metallic, again a surprise. Overall, not the massive bitter, hop monster IPA I thought it may be, instead I found a nicely balance and smooth IPA worthy of high praise. Very recommended.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

3849,"2003-09-01",3.7,"What an about face after drinking Fantome. Opens the eyes to the diversity of styles and how each can be great. Pioney hops to please the ""heads"" and sweet malt to ease the ride.

3849,"2003-08-31",4.2,"Hazy amber with an absolutely ridiculous head.  Like a typical west coast IPA but the key difference was a very mellow finish.

3849,"2003-07-27",3.7,"Not as wonderful as expected, I still enjoyed this Hophead's dream come true.  Massive hops is never matched properly by the malts, although the hops alone are top-quality enough to earn a very nce rating among it's peers.

3849,"2003-06-30",4.0,"The carbonation in this IPA is borderline ridiculous!  Upon the pour, a frothy, very thick white head develops, and active carbonation is visible in the clear amber body.  Aroma is floral, spicy hops.  Flavor has a distinct hops bite, but sweet malts provide the backbone, and I must admit the overall package is one smooth drink.  Looking over my ratings, I am surprised to find so many good IPAs, and this one stacks up with Stone's IPA, slightly below Bells Two-Hearted Ale, and doesn't quite reach the levels attained by my two favorites, Dogfish Head 90 Minute and Three Floyds Dreadnaught.

Victory is better balanced and smoother, while Ruination is tastes similar to this but is a bit more  refined and clean.  rerate 092404:  I'm really loving this right now.  I've been getting tired of IPAs with hops and nothing else.  I had a growler of Pure Hoppiness the other day, and I just wasn't into it.  The Alesmith IPA has a little malty swetness that just adds to it.  It has a very soft palate with some chalkiness to it.  It also has an excellnt tart, dark cherry aftertaste that lingers in underneath and in the back of the tongue.  I bumped it up a point in overall score","Fallbrook, California, USA","Kasteelfreak"

The aroma is has a light grain and caramel aroma seeping through intense pine cones and orange and grapefruit rind.  Very bitter, with plenty of hop flavor and tongue-puckering strength.  With all of the bitterness, it also has a pretty nice malt balance.  Hop resin, bitter citrus fruit and fresh green plant matter lay atop caramel chews and whole grains.

3849,"2003-03-16",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2015 Super soft on the palate, melts in your mouth. Balanced between its creamy caramel malts, bread notes and subtle citrus, with hops that lay way back behind it all and then finish strong with notes of pine and cedar.

3849,"2003-01-31",3.8,"Tasted on tap at the Alesmith brewery. This one poured a moderate to dark gold with lively carbonation and mild yet nicely thick and creamy white to ever so slightly tannish head. Aroma's of citrus and pine absolutely overwhelmed my nose and woke me up for another round. The taste is extremely fresh and piney. I have to agree with Peter that these are indeed some of the freshest hops around. Some malt is thrown in near the end to balance it out mildly, but this is highly skewed toward a palate ass kicking in the form of citrusy assaults!!!

For the style, Ive come to expect  big, lasting heads. The thin bitter hops are truly balanced by the nice big biscuity malt. Some IPAs have a complex hop flavor where theyre more than just bitter, but the profile on this one leans more towards the bitter with subtle  piney and malty citric notes.

Theres grapefruit in both the aroma and the flavor.  It has a bite that builds from mildly hoppy to bitter, and a pure hop finish.  YUM!!","Washington DC, USA","Kathy"
3849,"2002-08-19",4.1,"A very nice grapefruit and lemon rind aroma beginning segues into a very smooth, wait is this an IPA? I said smooth, damn. This is subtle and sophisticated IPA. This beer pours bright gold and brims with lace that would make a Belgian doily blush. Yet, there is plenty of good hops in here. It starts out very creamy and bitey, then fades away. This is not as big as some of the hop monsters out there these days, but deserve kudos for being a finely balance, well crafted IPA.","San Diego, California, USA","SpaceMonkey"
3849,"2002-08-14",3.0,"Hazy orange color.  Citrusy hop aroma and flavors, in fact there isnt much more than hops in here, somewhat unbalanced if you ask me.","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","daboskabouter"
3849,"2002-08-12",4.3,"Unusual but plesant gin-like junipery aroma, with a hint of citrusy Cascade smell.  Aromatic citusy bitter tea flavor.  Very clean mouthfeel for the style.  Too bad my tasting glass only held 4oz.","Newport Beach, California, USA","40oz"
3849,"2002-08-09",3.9,"much like the X, never quite lives up to the promise of its beautiful nose.  good, but could have been great","san diego, California, USA","CE619"
3849,"2002-08-08",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2003 Sparkling deep golden color and radiant PNW aroma of pine with some juniper. I was happy the bready malt flavors stayed subdued enough to enjoy a long bitter and eliminate any comparison to a barley wine that some of the big IPAs (DFH) now are causing. The taste is remarkably clean with a long citrusy bitter finish and a hint of mint. This one's a big winner.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
3849,"2002-08-03",4.3,"Slightly hazy, copper color, silky head of foam. 

Great fragrant hoppy aroma, fresh lemon and grapefruit, slightly metallic. Alcohol presence. Touch of sweet fruit. 

Tantalizing carbonation and slight sharpness but essentially smooth for its genre. Hop fruit prevalent throughout, but especially so in grapefruit bitter finish. Reminds me very much of an English cask IPA even if it is much more bitter.","California, USA","BeerLimey"
3849,"2002-07-27",4.1,"Very dry, hoppy with a pine aroma.  Nice IPA but not as much flavor or aroma as Ruination or Dogfish 90 minute.","Bloomington, Illinois, USA","dlclark"
3849,"2002-07-24",4.0,"Bronze; big cascade nose; very citrusy (grapefruit) - pure hop juice with a dry finish.  A pleasing drink.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
3849,"2002-07-22",4.1,"Unfiltered golden, bit of head.  Aroma is Cascade City!  Sweet cascade flavor, good body that holds throughout.  Not much balance, but you dont really miss it.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
3849,"2002-07-21",3.4,"High, sweet and soft pleasing aroma. Hopy, parfumy which was ok but is it the best IPA out there?","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"
3849,"2002-07-19",4.0,"Hazy golden colored with a creamy white head. Nice up front hoppy taste w/ a clean finish. A very nice IPA","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
3849,"2002-07-08",4.1,"A completely different animal than the Indica. Hop/pine resin aroma practically floats across the kitchen, accosting everything in its path. Nicely light tan in color, very evident hop & yeast? particulate. Has that creamy in-mouth feel that the major hop-monsters from Stone and Bear Rep. have. Very strong, muscled beer, but it goes down easy. Not nearly as much caramel malt as in the Indica, or some others, but still quite a treat.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
3849,"2002-07-06",4.3,"Poured the color of honey with a thin head that seemed to stick around as a thin lace on top. Aroma of hops and citrus.Palate is smooth with tiny bubbles and just enough body. First flavor is hops followed quickly by a little citrus tinge. Malt bringing up the rear balancing everything out. Ends crisp and clean. This is a great IPA! IPAs are not my fave style because lately it seems everyone just wants to out hop each other. Nice to find one that does not feel the need to go over the top just for the sake of it.","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"
3849,"2002-07-01",4.3,"This beer pours with a nice creamy head. It has a solid herbal, with hints of citrus, aroma. The palate detects a hefty hop presence, bitterness from which the tongue searches for relief. Enough malt is present to provide a balance. But overall, too much hop for my allergies to grasses, etc. But I wont hold it against the beer. For all you hopheads, this is a winner!","Marietta, Georgia, USA","brewbandit"
3849,"2002-06-24",4.5,"WOW.  Wondeful hop aroma.  Big hop bitterness balanced very nicely in the body.  An excellent IPA.  Definitely one of the best.","Acworth, Georgia, USA","belgianhomebrew"
3849,"2002-06-08",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2004 Huge hops aroma, and I mean huge.  There are chunks of hops floating along with the yeast.  The taste could easy overpower and kill a non-hop-head.  The best part is that I feel that I'm drinking beer and not just hops juice. I think this is hoppier than 90 Minute IPA or Stone 5th. I'll be back to this one.  Thanks Gusler!","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"
3849,"2002-05-30",4.1,"Excellent hop aroma.  Also great hop bite but the mouthfeel leaves me wondering what the beer is missing.  That is my only problem with it though.  It is definitely worth a try and i will drink it again.","San Diego, California, USA","akinm"
3849,"2002-05-29",3.2,"UPDATED: JUN 18, 2005 Post-Skip version: Overly husky malt flavors, unpronounced/sloppy hop flavors, and overly yeasty aroma and flavors. Not sure where the brightness has gone, as this was once teeming with bright, glorious hop flavors and aromas. This isnt what it once was, although Im told the recipe hasnt changed.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3849,"2002-05-23",4.6,"Vintage 2002: I really think it should have its own, but this will do. Pours a deep somewhat cloudy amber, frothy white head and sheets of lace. Nose is Hop floral, malt and a tad citrus, lots of goodies floating around in the bottle, Hops or Yeast?, good no matter which. Malt front, medium to full top, finish is All Hops, this is an IPA Lovers IPA,, and not meant for the Palate Challenged. Another Beautiful Beer, from my most favorite brewery. Trust me on this one if your a Hop Head, this is a must try, the hops just keeps comming back and back.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
