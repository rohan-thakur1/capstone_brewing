2974,"2016-09-11",2.9,"32 oz bottle. Hazy yellow. Corn husk, grain. Its not bad. Its a malt liquor. Im not sure it could be better and be to style.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
2974,"2015-02-08",2.7,"Tasted on 1/4/12 on draft. Pours clear pale yellow with a thin white head that leaves a thin collar of lace. The nose is sweet corny malt with some bread and very light hops bitterness. The flavor is fairly sweet corn malt with very light bread and the faintest hint of hops. The body is medium and oily with average fizzy carbonation and a medium sweet and lightly bitter finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
2974,"2012-12-27",2.9,"Tap sample in 10/2012. Poured dark amber color with an average frothy white head that mostly diminished with fair lacing. Moderate sweet sweet grain aroma. Medium body with a sticky texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Better then my expectations.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
2974,"2012-10-05",2.6,"Tried this at FFF. Served in an Imperial pint glass.

A: Well it looks like a malt liquor. Cloudy yellow straw with a white film ring around the edges after the thin head subsides.

S: Yup, smells like one too. Big corn fixture. Although there is a slight hoppy presence in there which makes this actually a decent smelling beer. 

T: Just like the nose. Corny barley and a light fruit hoppiness mixed in there. 

M: Typical creamy mouthfeel. Decently carbonated with a medium to light body. Some hops left on the palate which is refreshing to say the least.

O: Well, this is a malt liquor. Its still not a good style and this isnt really a good beer. Rating to style though, it is definitely an above average representation of a malt liquor. If the hops werent present this would have been another bad beer, they make it tolerable.

2974,"2012-03-12",2.5,"From notes.  First reviewed 11/2/2011.  Served on tap in a chalice at Northdown. What the hell, its Three Floyds, lets dive into some malt liquor!

My glass arrives with an already subdued head, more of a thin off-white film with a bit of a collar. The beer itself is a mostly transparent golden color that is a little hazy in the center.

The aroma is relatively faint. Gentle bready malts, some honey and caramel sweetness, creamed corn, grass, hay, and some herbs.

The flavor takes a few strange twists and turns. That is not language I would normally use, but the progression of flavors is more of contrast than flow. It starts out sweet, with some honey and bready grains. Next I get a tinge of herbs, grass, and spice. The flavor switches gears again with notes of sweet creamed corn, before finally finishing with a light prickly ethyl alcohol flavor. 

There is some sweetness throughout, giving off a juicy or vegetable quality. The body is definitely on the full side for the style, which is definitely an improvement over most other offerings. The carbonation is slightly crisp and creamy, which is also better than average. There is a slight stickiness.

If I am to believe Three Floyds description of this beer, ""this is what a malt liquor should be,""""I think I might just not be a malt liquor guy.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Some minerallity and mild sulfur. Flavors are sweet, corn, mild DMS, floral, light metal. Well hidden ABV. Lively bubbles and somewhat dry. Pretty decent.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
2974,"2012-01-31",1.4,"Draft at 3F. Yep, this is still around. Something about fermented corn at a high percentage is just off putting.  Very clear gold in a plastic cup, no head. Nose is grainy, no discernible hops, weird vomity note as well that is really gross. On tasting, initially it is pukey tasting, but that fades. Corn forward and boozy. Pretty miserable shit.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
2974,"2012-01-24",3.2,"Pours a pale yellow color with a short lived white head. Smells like malt liquor. Really sweet and simplistic aroma. Sugar and corn with a bit of cereal and not much ""real"" malt aroma. Some sweet fruit esters, though. The sweetness dominates the flavor, too. Sugar, apples, cereal, and corn make up most of it. No hop flavor or bitterness to speak of.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

2974,"2012-01-07",3.7,"On tap at the Pizza Port Carlsbad pouring up deep gold with faint haze and small near white head. The aroma has fresh floral hop notes, a bit of spicy hops and then a pretty good load of malt sweetened lageriness. The taste is similar with a pleasing prickly yet gentle floral and spicy hoppiness that only briefly ventures away from hop flavor toward hop bitterness. It has a robust base of honey like sweetness and apple like sweet esteriness within an undercurrent of sugar sweet malts and lager yeastiness. I found really no flaws that just about define the style.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

2974,"2011-12-11",2.7,"On tap at The Bavarian Lodge. Pours a clear, yellow-gold colored body with a finger-width, frothy, white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a light lacing. Aroma is corn, sweet grain, and a touch of florals. Flavor is similar. Sweeter grain and cereal malts, corn, some florals, and a very light grass. Finishes dry and clean with a very light bitterness before leaving a short aftertaste. Medium-light, somewhat sticky body with a moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty bland and generic beer, but it is a malt liquor and this is exactly what I expected. Very clean and lightly sweet while hiding the alcohol well. Not bad for the style.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Slightly hazy golden with a minimal white head. Aroma of corn, malt, sugar and some grain. The taste was sweet with a lot of malt and corn, also grain.

2974,"2011-09-06",2.8,"Draft on tap at the brewpub while picking up Zombie Dust 6ers (Munster, IN). Pours a hazy dulled golden yellow hue. A bigger frothy eggshell white head atop dies to a thicker film, laces ok. Aromas are crisp grains, corn, and bread. Some touches of grass, light yeasty dough, some touches of florals, faint lemon. Pretty dense malty bread, grain, cereal, some corn. Initial is lighter bodied, offering some gruff grains, cereal malts, touch of dry bitterness and some brash alcohol. Dry into the backend, a good deal of grass, bread, decent florals. Some light spice. Pretty dry leading into a less thorough and inviting cereal and grainy malt body, corn and bread. Some spice, mellow lemonsn grass. Finish is a bit of heaty and spicy alcohol, dry grass and dry breadiness. A strange beer, a bit tough on the palate and a bit of a labor for me to drink a full Imperial Pint. Meh.. I wouldnt try it again, but I generally hate high gravity lagers as it is.

2974,"2011-09-03",3.0,"On tap at the 3F brewpub.   A hazy yellow pour with a big fluffy white head, huge bubbles.  Aroma has apparent sweetness, some corn, as well as a mild fruitiness.  Alcohol is apparent in the aroma but not dominating for its high ABV.  Flavor has a medium sweetness from the alcohol, a bit of citrus, some hay and strong corn notes.  A rough rush of corn in the finish.  Light, fizzy bodied.  This is not really a style I appreciate or enjoy much.  On the other hand this is not a style that Ive had to opportunity to try a lot of craft brewery takes on.  That said, while I appreciate the irony of the craft brewer brewing a malt liquor, Im not sure Ill ever get geeked up about trying another one.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
