The aroma is earth, herbal and fresh cracker malt. The taste is really nice herbal clove, mineral, fresh hay and the bready cracker malt. The palate is light bodied with soft natural carbonation, mineral clean, lingering clove finish. Really nice Keller beer.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

3324,"2015-10-31",3.0,"GABF 2015. Kellerbier is a style I have been trying to understand since my travels in Germany. I liked this beer. Gold color and no head. Carbonation seems very low, a strong mineral quality, lager yeast and dry pilsner malt, sessionable, and enjoyable as a pilsner at least.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
3324,"2015-09-28",2.7,"Short notes from GABF. Lightly hazed gold with a short head. Aroma impression is generic pale malt, saccharine, saltine crackers, green hops, grass, celery. Light bodied, sweet, under-carbonated and seemingly under-fermented, watery short finish with low relatively bitterness. Sadly this is nothing like true Franconian kellerbier.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

3324,"2014-04-22",2.8,"On tap at Prost. Golden and lightly hazy appearance with a white head and lacing. Mild aroma of noble hops, pale malts and light spices. Similar flavor, mild bitterness, light sweetness and a touch of spice. A little bland, but pretty clean and easy to drink, finishing dry.","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"

Flavor is dry, clean, balanced. Lots of crackers, good grassy bite and a mouthfull of cereal. The finish is immaculate and dry.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
3324,"2013-06-06",3.6,"Clear golden with a persistent small white head. Nose is surprisingly more grassier and floral than I expected, bringing a crisp hop bite and pale malt sweetness to the nose. Flavor is both clean and yeasty with a grainy biscuity blonde-ness, a bit of earthy sweetness, and a subtle crisp hop bite on the finish.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
3324,"2013-05-18",3.8,"Tap at Prost - a buck fiddy more per glass than the regular pils - why? - anyway - just slightly hazy, with a pillowy head - drank side by side with the regular pils and didnt notice a significant difference - both were decently dry, with the same bitterness and crisp malt profile - this version had a bit more heft to it, and the light doughy/yeast character was fairly pleasant - like the regular pils, it is quite nice, but given the price difference, Ill be reaching for the regular pils next time.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
