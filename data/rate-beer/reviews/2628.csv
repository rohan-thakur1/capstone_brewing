2628,"2016-09-26",3.5,"Pours a clear, bright golden color, with a fluffy white head.

Smells of wet grass, fresh crushed black peppers, wheat, sugar infused white bread dough, balanced by fruity banana and a whiff of anise. The aromas come very well together, dont turn too sweet, but offering a perfectly balanced nose with a nice complexity to it.

Has a high, yet softer carbonation, complimenting to the stony mineral quality, which leads to an utmost refreshing appearance.

Tastes of a nice interplay between herbal hops, banana and soft straw with a clingy, sweet malt coating. Develops an effervescent mineral stoniness, reminiscent of cold well water, highlighting the prevailing banana flavor, which turns a bit fizzy during the finish.

Very light, well nuanced beer with a weak ending, as it simply does not hold up the beers initial complexity, but finishes a tad too sweet.","GERMANY","aleigator"

2628,"2016-03-28",2.8,"De Cervecería Paulaner Gruppe(GER) esta Wissen, Heffewissen o wissbier en su versión Krystal o filtrada, simplemente una Wissen tradicional sometida a un proceso de filtrado para retirar la levadura suspendida y restar los atributos fenólicos que esta otorga.
En apariencia es una cerveza con una buena corona de espuma, de perlas medianas y una retención no tan duradera pero con una excesiva actividad de carbonatación que la renueva constantemente, en color muestra un cristalino pajizo parecido mas a una cerveza lager(las Wissen son de la familia Ale), con un cuerpo ligero. En aromas pierde bastante complejidad sin los dotes de la levadura, se perciben de forma muy tímida los toques a plátano que generalmente tienen las cervezas de trigo bávaras, algo de bizcocho y dulzor de frutosisdad, nulo perfil a lupulo. Ya en el paladar toques a plátano, dulzor ligero de grano, sabor del trigo como base, semi seca al final y en textura algo acuosa, en realidad no hay mucho que decir de este estilo y esta cerveza, en lo personal no me agrada, la levadura es el carácter de una Wissen y aquí la emplean para después retirarla.","MEXICO","Yased"

2628,"2015-09-25",3.2,"The Kristallweizen in this classic Weissbier series, 50 cl bottle from an Albert Heijn supermarket. Forms the expected thick, dense, frothy, rocky, light yellowish white, very regularly structured head, over a cristal clear beer of the purest golden blonde colour, with lively sparkling. Aroma of dried banana and banana peel, unripe pear, cooked pasta and notably soapy wheat, soaked white bread, refreshing lemon zest (coming across a bit as lemon soap in combination with the wheat malt), cloth, cream cheese, sweaty grains, light bubblegum and faint cloves, in all very typical for the style, but overly cooked green cabbage (DMS) as well, often a sign of shortened cooking times apparently, something which should not come as a surprise from an industrial brewery. Refreshing onset of subdued fruitiness, hints of pear, starfruit and a lot of banana, bubblegum accent too with a featherlight lemony acidity around it, medium carbo, supple and slick body in which both the sourish, soapy wheat and the very pleasantly bready barley come through in perfect balance; somewhat oily but otherwise thin mouthfeel, with fading maltiness and wheatiness in the finish as well as retronasal, not unpleasant phenols (the classic Weissbier cloves aroma). Could use a tad more noble hops to give more structure to the finish (though there is a very faint lingering earthy bitterishness to it in the end); otherwise simply a decent Kristallweizen, bit generic as these filtered Weizens tend to be, but surely quenching especially due to the long-lasting wheat sourishness.  I do, however, prefer both the Hefeweizen and Dunkelweizen versions well over this.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

2628,"2014-08-13",3.6,"500ml Bottle at Paulanergarten, Bremen, Germany (4.20):
Good balance of wheat, banana & cloves with bubblegum & touches of yeast. Some sweetness appears with grassy notes & citrus too.

Clear amber with a lot of bubbles. The heas is a good sized, foamy white one with good retention over the opening minutes & lots of lacing too.

Citrus with cloves & wheat initially, some banana & bubblegum come next with touches of orange. I got hints of spice & there was a nondescript mix of fruits towards the end.

Smooth & light-medium bodied, strong carbonation with some added fizz and a good balance throughout. Lively & one that proved an easy one to drink.

Both times Ive had this beer Ive found it quite enjoyable, but much like the majority of kristalweizens that Ive tried Id probably go with the hefeweizen version if it was available, the only reason I didnt in this case was because of how easy the hefe is to get a hold on in the UK but Ive yet to come across the kristalweizen version at home.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

2628,"2014-01-25",3.0,"500ml bottle bought at foodGARDEN in D2 Place, Lai Chi Kok.
Clear golden honey colour; Two finger head with crumpety off-white foam which lasts for 1 minutes; Good sticky lacing and very fizzy carbonation; Very fragrant aroma of banana, pineapple, light floral, caramel, sugar, cloves, light spices, light malt and grass hints;
Minimal sweet taste of light malt, with pretty strong tartness, light metallic, wheat, faint banana, sour red fruits, light yeast, cloves, llemon, and very light grass; Mid to light body, slick and slightly crisp palate; Mouth feel is high-carbo, wheaty, still quite yeasty weiss in a good tartness background. Fewer fruity tastes and lighter cloves than Paulaner Hefeweiss proper, mostly sour red fruit notes and malt. Okay Hoppiness is lemon and thin grass in taste. Almost no bitterness, just moderate wheaty tart finish; Pretty dry after taste, very easy to mouth.

Comments: This one is less impressive than the colourful Paulaner Hefeweiss brother - lesser taste variety, head is less thicker, almost no hops - The upside being a still impressive estery aroma, thick body with nice tartness. All in all, good for the Kristalweiss style. Straight forward, make for easy drinking and a decent one. Still, I prefer the tasty Paulaner Hefeweiss, though.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

Eigentlich bin ich nicht ein Kristall-, sondern eher ein Hefeweizenanhänger. Die meisten Kristallweizen sind mir zu laff; nicht so dieses Paulaner: Goldgelbe, klare Erscheinung. Die Schaumkrone verflüchtigt sich recht schnell. Der Duft ist deutlich fruchtig-bananig, für ein Kristall ungewöhnlich gut :)
Der Geschmack ist erfrischend und dezent hefig, wobei zum Schluß eine Hopfennote hinzukommt. Für Leute, die bisher um Hefeweizen wg. der Würzigkeit einen Bogen gemacht haben, klar einen Versuch wert! Persönlich bleibe ich lieber beim Paulaner Hefeweizen Natürtrüb, aber dieses Kristall ist ein frisch-fruchtiger Sommerspaß.

Expected appearance for a kristall - golden, clear and with a nice head. Aroma was primarily difficult to rate because the waiter apparently meant that a slice of lemon was supposed to float around under the foamy head, and therefore had an unexpected touch of lemon. Besides from that, only some hay and malts. The flavor had again a touch og lemon or citrus fruits, but it was not to say if this was because of the lemon slice I of course had removed long time ago, or that the beer really has a touch of lemon in it. Then some hay, malts, a bit of sweet fruits (plums or banana) and a nice bitterness. Not as overwhelming sweet or artificial as many other kristalls. Nice, soft, thick palate.

Pours a clear pale straw-like color with golden nuances. A rather aggressive pour creates a very big and rocky initial head that settles just a little too soon, but leaves a nice uneven coat of foam that sticks around towards the end. Small lacings.

Malted wheat and the accompanying aroma of white bread, banana, faint notes of cloves and yeast in the nose.

A distinct taste of bananas, orange peel and even some sweet clementines. Some metallic flavor. More malted wheat and bread. The yeast, faint already in the smell, is even more moderate in the taste. The finish doesnt have much to offer - its semi-dry with a slight bitterness and fades away too quickly.

The lingering foam and strong carbonation provides a creaminess to the light body.

This is a decent beer, highly drinkable and quite refreshing, but its not very interesting. Its just too polished - its a bit unidimensional, and the flavors lack depth and are presented in a too orderly fashion. For someone who thinks a hefeweizen is too powerful, this one might be recommended though, since its basically a ""hefe light"".

2628,"2009-07-13",2.7,"Bottle - tried for a lugh, not a wheat beer fan at the best of times; was new in so thought Id give it a go on a warm day after work. Well, giving it a whiff Im pleasantly suprised by the aroma, its pretty much spot on for the style: yeasty, doughy, citrus and banana with a slightly curious and distant smokedness to it (maybe its my imagination playing tricks!) But, thats pretty much where any praise ends. It appears as you would expect, golden/pale pretty much lager like, obviously no cloudiness, quite rapid carbonation, very little head however. The flavour leaves alot to be desired; firstly your stung by the intense carbonation, then some flabby flavour emerges, starting with yeast, wheat and banana, the mid section tastes ok-ish then suddenly turns to water in the finish leaving behind a sort of gasy, over carbonated lager taste in the mouth competing with banana and citrus. Unblanaced (or maybe unhinged)It seems to me that this beer is confused about what it is: Lager or Wheat beer? At times it almost reminds me of a poorly made fruit lager/beer mutant. I cant get over the flippin carbonation, its just over the top. After two sips Im almost full with bloatedness. I probably had the beer ever so slightly to cold, but in many ways Im glad, as at any other temperature I dread to think what other flavours may lurk. Im sure Kristall Weiss has its roots in Germany, but in my opinion this is the equivalent of making up such a thing as ""Pale Stout."" It just doesnt work. Weiss beer may not be my poison but I still respect well made ones like Unrtl and Pyraser. Its only got the marks it has due to its aroma being relativley true to form. If this were a human being, it would be a Ladyboy from Thailand - CONFUSED!","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"
