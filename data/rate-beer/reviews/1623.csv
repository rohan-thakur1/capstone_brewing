1623,"2014-03-23",3.1,"Opaque, slightly yellow body. Sweet kind of herbal aroma. Taste is delicately sweet with a touch of booze on the finish. Not a bad sake.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","northropfrye"
1623,"2010-02-27",3.0,"Very full-flavored, with a clean and spicy nose, full-bodied with a particularly rich and spicy character. Good.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","Savvy1982"
1623,"2010-02-26",3.3,"Clear liquid with nice lacing. The aroma has a tun of bananna, vanilla, cedar, and a grassy note. The flavor is rich and complex. banana, cream, vanilla, licorice, berries, and wet hay and spice in the finish. Good, I would have this again.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","hobbersr"

1623,"2008-02-05",3.6,"Bottle- Clear yellow/goldish pour. Swirling produces good legging that lasts a while. The aroma is grapey and plummy, with touches of rubbing alcohol and citric floral notes. This is pretty tasty. Gum and floral/herbal flavours with white wine (sauvignon blanc), wood and booze coming through. A hint of sweetness stays on the finish as does the chalky dryness. Good.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"
1623,"2007-02-10",3.4,"Bottle. Pours a still, light clear colour with slight yellow tinges and thick legs. The aroma is sweet and fruity - notes of plum and pasture. There is also a significant alcohol presence. Silky body that has some candyish-type qualities and other somewhat doughy flavours. Dry finish with a harsh alcohol note. Pretty solid with a lot of dimension.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"
1623,"2005-03-18",3.0,"Strong fruit and alcohol aroma, clear. Flavour is also of strong fruit and alcohol, with spicey perfume notes. Medium bodied, warming and dry. A nice treat and the alcohol even at 15.5% isnÂ’t over powering.

 Thanks joey_capps.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DougShoemaker"
1623,"2005-03-14",2.8,"Sweet, dry, wino like, some alcohol, sweet rice grain. Clear, pale, hints of gold. More alcohol than expected, light bodied. A bit like honey wine. Interesting. My first sake.","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"
1623,"2005-03-09",3.8,"Clear w/ a slight yellow-green tinge & a light syrupy viscosity.  Nose is sweet, quite fragrant & relatively complex w/ floral & herbal notes of fennel, coriander, rose pedals, & candied pears. Supple, creamy texture.  Initially the flavour is delicate & softly sweet, then moves through a lightly acidic middle to a dry, spicy, very long finish that has a very strong alcohol presence.","Waterdown, Ontario, CANADA","joeycapps"
