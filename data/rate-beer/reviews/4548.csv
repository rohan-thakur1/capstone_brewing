Golden body with a good white hea. Aroma is grass, taste is bitter/grassy, lively carbonation.

You can drink liters of it and still not get bored.","Berlin, Berlin, GERMANY","rauchbierlover"
4548,"2015-09-29",3.3,"(Draught at Beer Geek Bar, Prague, 25 July 2015) Pale golden colour with frothy, white head. Malty, hoppy nose with notes of bread, citrus and grass. Malty taste with citrus, grass, bread, hay and a balanced grassy bitterness in the finish. Solid and well made, but a bit middle-of-the-roadish for a Matuska beer. Quite nice.","Hässelby, SWEDEN","Svesse"

4548,"2009-10-16",3.7,"A Mes rate: Keg at GBBF.Beautifully clean yellow gold with a superb lasting white head. This was an unfiltered version if that means anything. Just an amazing bit of Czech hoppage. Faint biscuity malt, loads of dry grassy notes and a really clean finish. Surrounded by run of the mill British stuff on the table, this was the only thing I wanted to drink at that point. So bloody drinkable I had to go back and get some more. Had a good chat with the brewer who was a really nice chap and he ended up giving me a free half and a Bernard glass. Nice one mate!","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
