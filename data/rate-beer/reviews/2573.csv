2573,"2015-11-04",3.1,"330mL bottle, pours a hazy pale golden blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out fermented out honey, lemon zest and lemon juice. Flavour is a good mix of honey and lemon zest -- with not too much citric notes, nor sweetness. The two main elements go together really cohesively. Perfumey, floral finish. Pretty solid for what it is, just not overly my thing.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

2573,"2015-08-30",4.1,"bottle. pours a pretty glowing yellow golden with white head. the aroma is very pleasant, lemon zest, coriander, pepper, floral bouquet, nice ester and phenol character, flavors continue in the same vein, excellent balance here, nice florals, citric, and peppery finish. carbonation is lively. mouth feel is a tad watery at times but thats really nitpicking. i dont think ive had a traditional belgian beer by an american brewer that has showed so much finesse in a long long time. a real beautiful stunner here.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
2573,"2015-08-19",4.2,"Pours a slightly cloudy gold. Outstanding head volume and retention, world class lacing.

Nice nose of lemon, honey, notes of pepper, hints of spice (coriander) and a touch of funk.

Heavy light body with a semi-smooth texture. Perfectly carbonated with a nice effervescent burst in the middle and a rollicking finely bubbled prickly finish.

The outstanding flavor profile is a bit laid back, but very complex and perfectly balanced. The lemon and honey lead off, then the pepper and coriander assert themselves near the middle. A very subtle bitterness occurs in the middle that fades into a light saison funk over a balancing malt and honey sweetness. The finish is crisp. This may be the perfect beginner saison.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

2573,"2015-06-24",3.6,"I am not sure what a bier de miel even is but this is something along the lines of a Belgain blond, pushing into triple territory. Its cloudy yelow w/ a thin white head of medium bubbles. Its nose is bread yeast up front which develops into more of a spicy character. This beer seems a little sweet at first but that sweetness is softened by some citrus character and--more so than that--vigorous but gentle carbonation, which also gives it a nice, full mouthfeel. It finishes rather light w/o being sticky or cloying at all and is overall a nice beer, though I do find myself wishing the had the same combination of flavors in a lower alcohol beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
2573,"2015-06-18",4.0,"Crisp hazy golden coloured body with a thick, four centimetre tall white head. Aroma of hay, grass, honey, yeast and a bit of alcohol - very nice and pungent. Medium-bodied; Assertive effervescence with rose petals, lavender, coriander seed, curacao, flowers, apples, honey, hay, grass and a good deal of wheat - very nice and super complex, especially for the style. Aftertaste is rich and well-rounded with the grassy and hay flavours at first making the spices and complex character that much more full. Overall, a very well-crafted beer with a lot of nuances and a great profile throughout - very nice to try! I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased just a few minutes ago at Whole Foods (Bowery) in New York, New York on 18-June-2015 for US$3,99 sampled in my hotel room here on Bowery in New York on 18-June-2015.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
2573,"2015-06-18",3.6,"Bottle in the old dining room!
Pours a lightly hazy pale yellow with a decent head and some lacing on the glass.

The aroma has a nice citrus zest thing going on as well as some nice spice and mineral notes. 
The flavor is mildly tart, a little punchy, florally bitter, with some citrus character and plenty of spiciness. The bitterness is sort of bracing towards the finish & it gives a nice lingering sensation. 

The beer is more spice driven than I would usually prefer, but its really in good form here, lots of stuff I dont normally get excited about in beers sort of working together to make a decent whole... fun","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

ABV is so under the radar, this could get ya in trouble. Memorial Day weekend I always reflect upon the people who died to keep us free -- and I spent more than just a little of my time as a soldier walking amongst the rows of stones in Arlington National Cemetery, ruminating on what it all meant then and still means today. Politics and all that go out the window today. All that matters is what they sacrificed. The only thing I can say to those men and women who served the posterity of our nation is thank you and God Bless. Cheers.","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"

2573,"2014-11-13",3.9,"Bottle in snifter: Poured carefully to leave the sediment in the bottle so I got a crystal clear pale golden hue with a fading fizzy head and not much lace. Plenty of flowery, spicy and honey esters on the nose. Light hop presence but it help develop complexity. The taste is part honey and part lemon zest with additional touches of Chamomile, Coriander and Rose Hips. The Juniper jumps in as in warmed which is a welcomed event. Smart carbonation with a mouth watering twangy finish. No way I would think this 7.5% ABV, drinks so much easier than that. This would have been a great Spring beer but alas that is not the case. I still dig it as a opening salvo on this blistery day.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
