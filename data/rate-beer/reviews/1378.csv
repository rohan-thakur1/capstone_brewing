1378,"2012-07-21",3.1,"Draught in the Weisses Brauhaus, dark brown-black with a frothy white head.  Pretty, sweet caramel nose, lightly tangy taste overtaken by light dusty earth, low bitterness with a hint of roast bordering on ash.  Medium body.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
1378,"2012-04-12",3.8,"On tap, Schneider Weisses Brauhaus, Munich. I think it is a schwarzbier rather than a dunkel. Aroma of nuts, cereal, hay, bread. I could bite to it. Roasty malts and coffee notes, really complex, just a bit watery texture. Good one.","Gyõr, HUNGARY","rozsoma"
1378,"2012-01-28",3.4,"At Schneider Weisse Bar in Munich. Pours chestnut brown with a nicely proportioned head and gentle bubbles. The nose has toffee and biscuits. The taste has ginger nut biscuits. The palate is medium bodied with a tangy texture and a so-so finish. Overall, solid.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","AshtonMcCobb"
1378,"2012-01-10",3.6,"Sampled last christmas in Munich.
Very tasty appearence with a thick beige head over a chessnut colored beer. Not much aroma just a tuch of light roasted malts. The taste is light roasted with a good bitterness. Huge drinkabillity.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","TEJA"
1378,"2011-10-10",3.4,"Draught  Beautiful reddish-cola coloured beer with a medium, stable light-tan head. Sweet bread, breadcrust, toffee and maplesyrup. Taste is drier than the nose, with chestnut, and a leafy finish. Again maplesyrup, but diluted and not overly sweet. Very slick, seems much better bodied than it really is. Another good, if unspectacular Dunkles - then again, the style is unspectacular.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
1378,"2011-09-13",3.6,"Pours brown with off white head. Lots of caramel and toffee, less of a chocolate note than a lot of dunkers but nice","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","BenH"

Appearance : Clear deep amber with a medium creamy head. Nice lacing.

1378,"2010-08-19",3.8,"Enjoyed a large glass of this at this old restaurant outside downtown Munich, which was just a splendid place to be.  Dark reddish brown, off white head.  Malty and spicy on the nose.  Spicy flavor, more spicy and dry than a lot of Dunkels.  Nice, expressive yeast.  This was a good one, though Im reviewing it from notes and I dont remember as much as I would like.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
1378,"2010-06-20",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 21, 2015 Had at Schneider Weisses Brauhaus, Munich.  A very nice example of a dunkel with lovely roasted malt flavors. Serving: Tap","Chicago, Illinois, USA","rubbishystuff"
1378,"2009-03-04",4.5,"Also had it at the Weißes Bräuhaus in Munich and its probably the best example of a Bavarian dunkel that Ive had.  The previous description was pretty good; nice color, dark but not opaque, with great roasted malt flavor.  Great pairing with a Haxl or other Bavarian specialty the sweetness sets off the salty meat perfectly.  Dense, off-white medium head was also delicious.  Im not sure if its brewed by Schneider Weiße or not... but definitely worth stopping if youre in Munich.","Pennsylvania, USA","jar1087"
1378,"2008-09-03",3.7,"Draught at Schneider Weisses Brauhaus, Munich.
So I’m first to rate this really good dunkel. Nice reddish cooper coloured, medium sized off-white head that went away slowly. Pleasant roasted malt and toffee aroma, malty and light chocolate flavor with notes of spices and dried fruits in the finish. Lingering roasty aftertaste.","Zagreb, CROATIA","ogivlado"
