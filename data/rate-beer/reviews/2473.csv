2473,"2017-05-29",3.2,"appearance:  bright yellow, slight haze, a finger of yellow-white head, decent lacing.  aroma: hugely aromatic, with lots of mango, pineapple, grapefruit, white pepper, then some cracker, pie crust, and grass.  taste: 	sweet mango, light mint, pineapple, lemon, orange zest, floral honey, pie crust.  finish: lingering sweetness, balanced by the bitterness of the citrus and floral hops. notes:  Doesnt taste anything like a pilsner or a lager. More like an IPA in the vein of Heady Topper, in that its a similar flavor profile. I prefer my pilsners (and super pilsners) to taste like grass, hay, and pepper. That said, its a good beer.","Maryland, USA","JDBaker11058"

2473,"2016-05-26",3.4,"Dry, grassy pilsner characteristics, pine and citrus IPA aromas. Green apple tartness and moderately bitter.

2473,"2016-02-24",5.0,"Pounder can from Capones. Pours turbid golden with 2-fingers of well retained white head. This one looks like a Maine/Vermont IPA. Nose is...my God, lemme tell ya bout the nose, Bob Griese. A huge olfactory wallop of white peppercorns, mango, honeydew peaches in heavy syrup, and that Maine hop nose that I could bury my nose in for hours. Tastes super smooth, with heavy hop notes, mango, pineapple, white pepper, dry, resiny, hops, and that great Maine/Vermont flavor and finish that is somewhat dry, spicy, floral, and loaded with tropical fruit.

The pils malt taste doesnt appear as expected, mostly overpowered by a citra type hop and oiliness of a very slightly overgrained brew. But quite interesting.","Pennsylvania, USA","Voodoo"
2473,"2015-11-15",4.3,"Excellent and very fresh, as the title suggests. Frothy head and straw body promises a very well made brew. It doesnt disappoint. The hops are very fresh and zesty-- not unlike an IPA-- but I didnt get the piney, strong and sticky sweetness one would get with an American IPA. Its more refreshing, even at 7.6%. Alcohol stays well hidden, another fine attribute of this quite remarkable beer.","Rutland, Vermont, USA","canary dog"

2473,"2015-10-29",4.5,"Theres definitely a similarity to hoppy brews being made by New England breweries. Whether its IPA, DIPA, IPL, or in the case of Peak Organic Super Fresh  a pilsner  theres a common thread amongst them. Im not sure this beer truly qualifies as a pilsner per se, but as a beer its quite excellent. Smells great, looks great, tastes great and is easy to drink. Thats what I call an excellent beer.

I poured a 16oz can into a pilsner glass. It was canned on 9/17/15 and cost $4.10 ($0.26 per ounce).

Appearance: A hazy shade of mustard/maize yellow. Spastic effervescence is clearly visible at first, though the more beer I pour into the glass, the hazier the body becomes. Pours to a large, white, foamy head which laces and retains extremely well.

Smell: Huge hop presence of fresh-cut grass as well as tropical fruit juice concentrate. No alcohol presence, though no malt presence, either.

Taste: I dont get too hung up on styles unless Im judging a BJCP-sanctioned event (in which case its mandatory). Im not sure this beer really qualifies as a pilsner considering how its a big beer at 7.6% ABV and also a hop bomb. Its probably better considered an IPL or DIPL; though Ill let the style nerds debate that. What it is, is a highly-hopped, extremely tasty and delectable brew. Slight grassy notes to open the palette with a subtle juicy flavor lurking underneath. At the peak of the swig theres a spicy/herbal note with mild flavors of oregano or basil. The back end is remarkably sweet with a taste akin to an energy drink. The aftertaste is all the spice rack flavors: grassy, spicy, herbal and a dry bitterness that lingers. Obviously, the hops are the star here, and I dont get much in the way of malt distinctiveness. Ill bet some rye would complement the palette perfectly.

Drinkability: I normally associate pilsner with being light in body and alcohol. Peak Organic Super Fresh does have the high carbonation and consistent crispness of a pilsner, though the 7.6% ABV potency is far too heavy to really be true to the style. The mouthfeel is noticeably thicker than most lagers, though the high carbonation makes it vibrate across the tongue. Refreshing while in the mouth, though the aftertaste of spicy hops is a tad cloying. Of course that can be resolved by taking another swig. This is a versatile brew to be sure; strong enough to stand up to all kinds of savory meals, or just enjoy whenever you need a strong hop dosage.

2473,"2015-10-20",4.2,"Nice complex aroma of citrus, floral hops, and grassy or bready malt. Very nice looking deep gold body.. slightly cloudy with good carbonation.

2473,"2015-10-17",4.0,"Can from the Quick Stop Londonderry.
Fairly clear deep yellow color with a huge frothy white head that persists forever. Overripe tropical fruit and rind overpower the nose, but eventually some hints of pine and light crackery malt make it through. The flavor is a bit sweeter with bready maltiness and lots of citrus and juicy tropical fruit flavors. The pine is quite subdued in the flavor and would have helped out a bit to cut through some of the sweet flavors here. Still a damn good pilsener right here, glad I bought the intensely white four pack.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"

2473,"2015-09-03",3.4,"Pours slightly hazy gold with an off-white head. Both the aroma and the flavor are the delicious citrus and floral hop bomb that you get in regular Fresh Cut. However, boosting the abv adds in some syrupy sweetness and strong alcohol notes. It also adds a sticky and grainy mouthfeel. This is good, and I love the 16 oz can format, but this isnt the slam dunk that is Fresh Cut.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ScipioA"
