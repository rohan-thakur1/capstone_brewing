2471,"2015-12-10",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2016 A really ¬íold¬í favorite. In the 1960¬ís, I got drafted and was fortunate enough to spend a year and a half stationed in Bamberg, Franconia, Bavaria, Deutschland. And to learn what real beer was like and enjoy the numerous small Franconian breweries while my friends and brothers were being killed in yet another senseless imperialist war. But anywho, toward the end of the month and the next payday, we GI¬ís were always broke and in need of some mind numbing forgetfulness for pocket change, and I hit on a few bottles of this Eisbock, at one mark a bottle (at that time 25 cents) plus a couple of shots of cognac (similarly priced) as a quick trip to la-la land. Good non-memories of several wasted years serving Uncle Sam. Anyway,
my local astonishingly good pub, The Foundry, invited me to a free holiday event this evening, featuring several brewed for the occasion small casks, and when those ran out, a selection of their bottled stuff, resulting in the appearance of several sixers of the aforementioned Eisbock. What can I say. Same old shitkicker! Here I copy a BA review, as most reviewers of this brew appear to be as inebriated as myself... ""Aroma of sweet, rich malt, dark dried fruit, hints of brown bread. Flavor follows aroma, with rich sweet malt, dark dried fruit, hints of molasses and brown bread. Classic bock flavors, but a little more intense. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A nice, classic eisbock, providing great bock flavors intensified by the ice process, well balanced between fruit and malt flavors. Alcohol is well covered and this can be a sneaky beer since is it slightly sweet and full of flavor, it is hard to sip slowly. Nicely done."" Yeah, down the hatch.

Very purely malty aroma of dry cookies, caramel candy, damp cloth, brownies, hint of tea, toasted brown bread, dried banana, chestnuts, butterscotch, leather, quite a lot of iron but coming across as quite natural still. Condensed sweet onset, candied dates, dried banana and hints of candied cherry, ¬ídeep¬í and subtle sourishness balancing this sweetness, soft carbo, very caramelly middle with nutty and chocolatey accents, smooth and lightly oily, fairly thick mouthfeel, fruit sweetness carrying on over this thick caramel sweetness, light bittering in the end, a little bit toasted with soft, ¬ístructural¬í herbal and earthy hop touch; somewhat liqueurish and gin-like alcohol warmth is there from the middle and heats the throat a bit without becoming astringent - or even without decreasing the surprisingly high ¬ídrinkability¬í of this beer seen its ABV.

2471,"2015-04-29",4.3,"12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at ~45 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a deep hickory brown, shaded vaguely with red tones, and forms a thick very pale off-white head with good retention. Lacing is decent.

Smell: Deliciously malty, dark yeasty bread and lightly roasted grains.

Taste: Thick, warm, yeasty dark bread of several different types - rye, pumpernickel, pretzel, pandoro - fills the mouth, suffused with swirls in the loaf of a mixture of caramel and toffee. Towards the finish, a syrupy sweetness comes through beneath the bread, as if there were a toffee tree that could give forth toffee syrup.

Mouthfeel: Full and creamy, though not quite as much as other eisbocks I have had.

2471,"2014-09-14",4.3,"Poured from bottle into a snifter
 Appearance ¬ñ The beer pours a super deep mahogany color that is bordering on black. Upon pouring there is a small tan colored head that fades over about a two minute time frame to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass and some foam islands on the surface of the brew.
 Smell ¬ñ The aroma is huge of a dark fruit smell with tons of dark cherry, plum, fig, and grape. Along with these dark fruit and sweet smells are some of sweet smells of molasses. A good showing of roasted malt and toasted grain as well as a very strong booziness being there as well producing a quite dark and robust aroma overall.
 Taste ¬ñ The taste begins with a thick and sweet dark fruit flavor of cherry, plum, and prune. The sweeter fruit, which create a heavy base flavor for the brew, are also joined by some tastes of caramel and molasses. There is a good showing of a roasted malt flavor upfront which ends up getting slightly stronger as the taste moves to the end. As the taste moves beyond the middle of the profile, a little bit of an herbal and earthy flavor joins the tongue, but these remain relatively light throughout. Some toasted grainy flavors come more toward the end of the taste and are joined by some flavors of cocoa and even more molasses. With a light rummy boozed flavor coming to the tongue at the very end, one is left with a super dark and sweet flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel ¬ñ The body of the beer is very thick and chewy with a very light level of carbonation. For the style and the big sweet and dark flavors of the brew the feel is spot on, making for one enjoyable slow sipper.
 Overall ¬ñ This is a very nice Eisbock with tons of sweetness and a good roastedness. A rather tasty and big sweet brew.","","Darkmagus82"

Aroma feels like smelling brown sugar candy - it has a strong malt base and a lot of sweetness. It has pretty high alcohol but it doesn¬ít come out in the aroma. Taste is actually quite smooth, dark fruits, that same caramelized brown sugar candy. Aftertaste has some plums, molasses and no rough edges. Nice and warming winter beer.","ESTONIA","jinroh"

2471,"2013-12-25",3.9,"Review from notes 7/7/10
Poured from 33cl bottle purchased at Jim¬ís Homebrew in Spokane, WA ($4) into Sam Adam¬ís glass.

A: Dark ruby brown with thin lace at rim. Central dome of dissipating bubbles.

S: Strong and sweet grain, bread, toast, nut. These all combine and form a graham cracker scent. Nice.

T: Nice. Figs, cherry, deep roasted coffee. Hint of spice, resin. Toasty finish, like a good dessert.

M: Creamy medium body with low carbonation allows beer to flow strait back to throat with ease or to rest on tongue. 

D: Excellent craftsmanship. Enjoyable experience. Nice how the flavor and body changes with amount of time in mouth. Transitions from the initial sweetness to resonate into the more complex nuances of hops and grain.

Appearance: In the glass it looks dark brown with reddish highlights. It is topped by a small tan head that quickly fades to a light ring of foam. Lacing is minimal and very slick.

Smell: The aroma is the star of the show and offers deep inviting layers of malty goodness. I get lots of sweet roasted malt, caramel and dark fruits like plum, figs and raisin with drop of molasses and rum like alcohol.

Taste/Palate: Its flavor matches the aroma to a tee but comes off a little lighter than I had expected yet still full bodied. It brings all the wonderful layers of maltiness with a mellow warming abv. It finishes sweet but not in a heavy or cloying way and the palate is smooth and full yet still very drinkable for such a big beer.

Notes of tobacco and more dry dark bread on the finish. Warming but not boozy. Wow. Thick and slick, with low, gentle carbonation.

Taste brings the booze and more sweetness. Caramel and raisins are the prominent flavors. Sugary, though not sticky amazingly enough. The beer is well-carbonated, which lightens the texture of this one considerably. Was not expecting that at all, which for what I want, is not a good thing. Finish is boozy raisins.

2471,"2013-04-12",4.2,"I poured an 11.2oz bottle into a snifter. There was no decipherable freshness date.

Appearance: Pours out a dark brown shade, but appears to be opaque black in the glass with ruby red highlights. Forms a relatively large, eggshell, foamy head which retains and laces well.

Smell: Strong alcohol presence, but distinct fruit as well. Similar to a flavored liqueur.

Taste: The eisbock is a style that¬ís hard to come by, but if you¬íre lucky enough to find one you¬íre usually in for a treat. Kulmbacher Eisbock definitely was for me as it¬ís comparable to a traditional barleywine as far as flavor goes, but with a thinner, slightly crisp body because it¬ís a lager. Dark fruits like red apple, cherry, fig and plum as well as toffee are all quite prominent. The alcohol is as well, but it¬ís not distracting and makes the beer drink like the true sipper it should be. 

It¬ís a well balanced palette all around, too. Though definitely on the sweeter, maltier side, Kulmbacher Eisbock is not a sticky, syrupy mess. There is some residual flavor on the tongue, but it is not cloying or drying, but rather just ""there."" The taste is quite delicious, though not what I would consider among the best of the best. Still, you¬íre in for a treat if you drink this beer.

Drinkability: For a strong beer, Kulmbacher Eisbock is no challenge to drink at all. Though the 9.2% ABV potency is noticeable in the nose and in the taste, there¬ís no raw heat or burn in the drinking process. The mouthfeel is on the thicker side for sure, but soft and slightly crisp. Probably best enjoyed as a dessert or special occasion beverage, though.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

The smell is all malty molasses: with a dark alcohol laden fruit cake dropped into the brew. The taste is also sweet malty fruit cake: raisins and Victoria plums soaked in a bitter-sweet balsamic mix with some caramel and burnt butterscotch all add to make this beer more than just a uber strong Bock.

Appearance: Dark dark brown, near black.  Opaque.  1-1.5 fingers of soapy khaki-colored head.  Looks nice in the glass.

Aroma: Lots of malt notes (milk chocolate, biscuit, slight roast) mixed with dark fruits (raisins, figs).  Slight banana, almost Belgian smell.  A touch of booze. 

Taste: Milk/bittersweet chocolate, brown bread, biscuit, very slight roast.  Figs, dates, raisins, and dark berries through the middle and into the finish.  There¬ís some caramel and toffee present into the finish that works well with the rest of the flavors. Some spiciness (cinnamon) as it warms.

Mouthfeel: Syrupy, thick. The alcohol isn¬ít hidden at all.  Definitely a noticeable warming in the throat.

Overall: This is a delicious beer.  Because this was my first eisbock, I wasn¬ít 100% sure what to expect, so I can only compare it to other styles.  It reminded me of a dubbel with touches of Belgian-ish flavors mixing well with the rest of the palate.

2471,"2012-02-16",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2015 Tasted from 12oz bottle into nucleated pint glass. Poured an opaque dark brown color with moussy beige foam, lasting with nice lace. Strong aromas of raisin bread, loads of caramel, fruitcake, perfumey noble hops, and amazingly almost no alcohol or fermentation esters/phenols. Rich malty-sweet flavor, almost syrupy but not cloying because it was offset by just enough subdued hops tartness, toast, toffee, semi-sweet chocolate, hints of hardwood and more dried dark fruits: raisins again, prunes, cranberries, mulberries. Almost no trace of alcohol in the flavor either; a truly remarkable disappearing act at 9.2% ABV! Medium body, not as heavy as I expected. Low-medium carbonation. Well-rounded, smooth, almost sticky mouthfeel. Long-lasting tangy, candy-like aftertaste. Definitely a winter warmer to be sipped. Reminiscent of a Trappist Quad. Highly recommended on a cold night.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"

Pours a moderate amber-copper color with a pretty good off-white head. A bit of spotty lacing on the way down and a nice, thin collar around the edges of the beer. The nose is pretty sweet with some dark fruits and a touch of oxidation. Not all that much alcohol. The taste is a bit of caramelized malt with some fruit and quite a bit of sweetness. Not much booze comes through in the feel, though that might be because it¬ís quite sweet, bordering on cloying. Not a bad beer but half of this bottle was more than enough for me.

2471,"2011-04-13",4.2,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 11.2oz bottle into a large snifter.

Appearance: In the glass it looks dark brown with reddish highlights. It is topped by a small tan head that quickly fades to a light ring of foam. Lacing is minimal and very slick.

Smell: The aroma is the star of the show and offers deep inviting layers of malty goodness. I get lots of sweet roasted malt, caramel and dark fruits like plum, figs and raisin with drop of molasses and rum like alcohol.

Taste/Palate: Its flavor matches the aroma to a tee but comes off a little lighter than I had expected yet still full bodied. It brings all the wonderful layers of maltiness with a mellow warming abv. It finishes sweet but not in a heavy or cloying way and the palate is smooth and full yet still very drinkable for such a big beer.

Nice caramel and nutty maltiness, a slight alcohol hint, perhaps a hint of cafe latte and cardboard. Taste is pretty much the same, but it drinks really easily with only small note of the alcohol. Hints of sweets and nuts. Really nice, better than expected.","Copenhagen (formerly Aalborg), DENMARK","phredrik"

2471,"2011-03-08",3.4,"2003 bottle, fresh bottle. Surprisingly similar despite difference in age ¬ó less carbonation and less bitterness in the older bottle. Plus the aged beer displayed more dark fruit and was more sherry-like. Deep amber, approaching brown, body. Short, frothy tan head, mostly diminishing. Sweet, fruity aroma of caramel, molasses, brown sugar and toasted grain. Notes of sherry and alcohol in the aged beer. The flavor is heavily sweet, lightly bitter and lightly acidic. It finishes moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic and lightly bitter. Medium to full body, syrupy texture with lively carbonation in the fresher bottle and mild carbonation in the 2003. The fruity aroma is appealing and the beer hits the front of the tongue with a variety of flavors ¬ó dark, overripe fruits, bread, molasses.

2471,"2011-02-10",4.2,"""The Original German Eisbock""

Comes in a brown bottle with a flashy ""Ice"" label. Pours a nice tan 1 inch head that appears very bublly and thick, you cannot see thorugh the dense, dark color of this beer.

The smell is overwhelmingly of chocolate, with a juicy(yes) smelling toffee malt to finish. The smell is pretty scrumptious.

Taste is a lot more bitter than expected, and its gooood. Lots of dark roasted malts, coffee like bitterness, and a very faint bit of molasses/chocolate sweetness in the middle. This is a nice robust brew with only little traces of its 9.2% of alcohol which isn¬ít overpowering, but its there and increases as it warms. Its got a really nice and thick mouthfeel with a fair amount of carbonation. It leaves a good amount of stickiness in your mouth and on you lips though you cant taste the sugars as prevalent as you can smell and feel them although it does get slightly sweeter as it warms with the alcohol.

Overall this is a highly worthy brew and would fit well in a dessert setting.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

Medium-bodied for the style with a slight dryness despite the malty sweetness.  Not boozy at all.  This is a killer eisbock.

2471,"2010-05-06",4.4,"Bottle.

A - Dark black with some ruby brown hues on the edge. Small frothy and bubbly off-white head. Reduces fast with just tiny patches of lacing left.

S - Somewhere between toasted and roasted dark malt. Fairly sweet with caramel, brown sugar and molasses present on the nose. Some dark fruit (plum and date especially) and just a faint hint of overly ripe banana. Some alcohol also present, making it somewhat like a dessert port or other dark dessert drink. Full, rich aroma with a promise of some sweet, gummy flavors.

T - Similar to the nose. A lot of rich dark malt. A touch of bread flavors but loads of burnt caramel, brown sugar, molasses, and chocolate are much more dominant. Also a strong amount of dark fruit (strong plum, date, and raisin presence). All these make a sweet sticky, rich flavor. Some alcohol is present but it isn¬ít very strong and really just provides a nice warming touch that also balances the sweetness a bit. Mid sip there is a touch of earthy hops along with a nutty flavor and some dark chocolate and licorice.  The dark malt and fruit comes out again at the end and lingers on the tongue.

M - Full body with moderate carbonation. Very velvety, silky smooth with the flavors having a sticky/lingering aspect. A very full and rich beer.

D - Very drinkable beer. It is a touch too sweet and too high of an ABV to have another in a night, but I certainly would be tempted. I would definitely would have it another night though. Such a rich and smooth beer with a lot of flavor means this is quite a drinkable beer. Makes a wonderful dessert or night capper.

Notes: Best before 14/09/10. A very nice beer that is pretty sweet but not cloying and has enough flavors to balance it out. The alcohol is present and provides a nice warming, but it is very well masked. Very enjoyable beer that is a great way to finish a night. I highly recommend trying it.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Pours dark brownish/red with red highlights. Not much of a head. The aroma is a mix of alcohol and caramel malt with a lot of malty sweetness. The predominant flavor is nuttyness as well as alcohol, dark fruit and malt. Not too much hop flavor. Tastes about like a concentrated bock, which judging from the way it is made, is probably what the brewers were going for. Medium mouthfeel and definitely a sipper.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"

Aroma is very sweet, pretty much all malt, cloyingly sweet , a bit of a dark fruitiness, candy forward, some honey and caramel. Flavor starts with a basic malt sweetness, sugary with some toasted malt, a little bit bready. The alcohol starts to come midway and remains through the finish which is accompanied by a little bit of brown sugar and dried fruits. No hops or bitterness.

The head thins rather quickly but holds to the glass well.  Strong aroma of brown sugar and dried fruits: figs, dates, and brandied raisins.  Rich taste that isn¬ít as sweet as the nose would indicate.  Instead it¬ís a mouthful of toast and tart fruit.  Medium booziness fades into a surprisingly bitter hoppiness.  The high alcohol content is noticeable, for sure, but not overpowering.  Instead, the alcohol provides a nice backdrop for the roasty malts and hop bitterness.

The taste of the beer is overpowering. Extremely sweet. Lots of licorice. Sends tingles through your body with even the smallest sip. Fruity, with the ever so slight amount of hop bitterness.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, dark mahogany with a small, off-white head that mostly diminished and left fair lacing. The aroma was heavy grain, cereal and caramel malts; light hops; toffee, light butterscotch and alcohol. The initial flavor was rather sweet; while the finish was sweet, light to moderately bitter and an average to long duration. There was caramel, grain, malt, malt and more malt, slight hops, toffee, molasses and alcohol.

2471,"2008-12-10",3.9,"Bottle. Pours clear dark brown with a big off-whit head. The aroma has a fantastic and sweet wort-like, grainy German maltiness with tones of caramel, sweet juicy dark bread, almond paste, maple syrup, light roast, caramelized nuts and dark fruits like prunes and sugar sweaty figs. The woody alcohol notes are notable - yet surprisingly soft. Some grassy and mild herbal hops are also present. Cocoa milk. The flavour is massive malty with an alcohol sting to back it up. Tones of caramel, oatmeal cookies, sweet wort, grass and herbs. The flavour is maple sweet but the alcohol dries out the beer on the finish. Light to medium sweet. The mouthfeel is fat, syrupy and chewable with a nice smallish carbonation. The aftertaste is of dark fruits, wort, brown sugar and a light hoppy touch.  Medium to full bodied.","G√∂teborg, SWEDEN","Marsiblursi"

Pours a dark brown color with nice foamy beige head which dissapears. Not that much lacing.

Aroma is maybe not that powerful as some beers, like imperial stouts and barley wines, can be, but still very nice. Malty with lots of liquorice and dried fruits. I also feel something I would describe like some strong wine, maybe port? Nice.

Flavour is rather malty but not that sweet. Notes of liquorice, caramel, lots of dried fruits and dark bread. Pretty similar to the smell. Very well hidden alcohol, though it is slightly warming. Almost excellent taste actually. I really enjoy this.

Very complex - I am sure there is other flavours and aromas I can not detect here.

Mouthfeel is very filling. It feels rather fullbodied with low carbonation, a bit creamy and almost sticky.

Drinkability is rather high for the high ABV. Goes down a bit to easy maybe? Great beer!","Karlstad, SWEDEN","Ljunkan"

Body is much more sensational, some almond and hazelnut with loads of earth, wood, and some vanilla to boot.  Very sweet, almost cloyingly so but that same sweetness brings a 60 second finish.

Its quite fumy from the alcohol note, with traces of candied sugar coming through as well.  The flavor follows suit, as sweet caramel, nougat, and dark fruits combine for a heavy, malty punch.  A strange, almost vegetal component enters the fold on the finish, which is a bit unsettling.  A medium-full, syrupy body plants that sour vegetable taste at the far rear of the tongue.

Medium to full bodied with creamy carbonation. The flavor is caramel, toffee, roasted malt. There is a component that reminds of the old Grapette soft drink - arguably Concord grape (presumably available at Walmart!). Fruity and malty. The finish is not excessively sweet, and the gritty roast malt aspect tends to balance the sweetness. Malt balancing malt?

When the ""beer guy"" at the shop told me it was a lot like Celebrator and that I could even do a side by side tasting, my immediate thought was something along the lines of: ""Brother. You are really putting your reputation on the line here."" It was my first suggestion from him and anyone in the store for that matter. I took his advice though and took a bottle of Celebrrator to do a side by side tasting. The two are virtually twins I feel, with minimal characteristic differences. The Celebrator has a more roasted quality and the Kulmbacher has a sweeter edge...and also 2.5% more on the ABV.

The flavor is rich and malty with flavors of prunes, raisins, apricots, and vanilla with a mild roastiness that caps it off.  Unfortunately, the beer suffers from some sort of structural issue that makes it seem incredibly thin and watery and yet, at the same time, too sticky for my tastes as well.

2471,"2007-06-07",4.2,"Appearance: Pours out a dark brown-dark red color marked by a ring of very fine, off-white froth.

Smell: Oh, yes! A splendid, sweet aroma of plums, caramel, port wine, and molasses. 

Taste: Astoundingly sweet! Such sweetness. I just felt a reflexive shot of adrenaline shoot through my beer-infested veins.

Be right back.

Alright. Whew. A great, seemingly endless depth of rich maltiness with intense flavors of caramel, brown sugar, maple syrup, and dark fruits. There¬ís a slight nuttiness present, as is an ever so faint hop bitterness. The finish is a bit of a contradiction, as the acute flavors stay on the tongue for several minutes at a time.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied. A touch of soda-like carbonation keeps this beer from being too syrupy. Still... it¬ís quite silky. Almost sensual.

Any thicker, and this beer would go great on a batch of pancakes!

Drinkability: Just the one, thank you. Whew.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Ripe dates, sweet, slight alcohol, faint caramel, molasses, and a sort of mustiness. The flavor isn¬ít quit as upfront as the aroma. Taste mostly molasses and mellow aged raisins and dates. Also has that mustiness to it. The alcohol is well done. The palate is very nice, thick, smooth, and full. The finish is very warming and satisfying.

2471,"2006-12-28",3.4,"33,cl. This label must be a hoot at parties. (If an American brewer making *any* amoutn of profit tried this label, though, I¬íd bash it relentlessly.) Pours a gorgeous deep dark brown with a dense but thin layer of moussy off-white head that doesn¬ít stick around for too awfully long. Some occasional clingy lace. Buttery, toffeeish, brown-bread notes dominate the nose. Cloying, sticky-sweet attakc; thick body, low (but perceptible) carb, and bold flavors. Lots of malt sugar all over the place. Tastes almost like a stuck mash, there¬ís so much unfermented, but of course we know better. This is just a grain surplus turned into a refreshing party beverage. The mid-palate carries that explosion of meadow flavor across into a sticky, metallic finish. My brain certainly wants to understand how amazing this beer is and how highly regarded it¬ís been for so long, but this doesn¬ít satisfy as refreshment or as a contemplative beer to sit and sip. It¬ís groundbreaking, rather than timeless.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

The color is a very dark murky brown with very faint red/orange highlights.  This has a highly alcoholic smell.  Dark dried fruit, brown sugar, dough are also present in the aroma.  The palate is super sweet yet balanced a bit by the alcohol.  But the alcohol isn¬ít a negative or out of place.  In the middle of the palate is a nice graham cracker taste that is in between the layers of sweetness.  I love this, but then this is my favorite style of beer.","Rochester, New York, USA","jb"

Typically high alcohol equals no head and this one is a whopping 9.2% by volume. The aroma was a complex sweet fruity mixture of caramel malts and dried dark fruits such as plums and raisins and dates. There was also a background note of aged leather and oak. The body was quite full with a soft carbonation and a thick, smooth texture. The flavor started out quite sweet and stayed that was. The flavor profiles followed the aromas closely.

2471,"2006-11-10",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2006 Pours a very clear, but dark, amber with a tan head that dissipates quickly. The smell contains lots of malts, some roasted notes (toasted bread), some fruit (prunes), and some alcohol. The flavor is very malty and delightfully bittersweet from the hops. It starts off with a well balanced interplay of thick and doughy malts with floral and peppery hops. The carbonation provides some zip on the middle of the tongue along with a touch of alcohol bite. The finish is malty sweet with a nice dose of bitter hops and is surprisingly dry with a dry, complex after-taste. The mouthfeel is not as thick as its strength might suggest (the magic of ""eis""bock). It is full-bodied, but not nearly so as other strong bocks.

Very dark red. Big brown head fades away, leaving traces of brown and white along the rim of the top of the beer with little clouds on the inside. Good lacing. 

Smells quite Belgiany, actually, like a Belgian dark pale ale. I was thinking it would be more like alcohol and bock malt, for some reason. Anyways, you got big, very ripe fruit, exceptionally sweet plums and soft peaches, backed up with a nice alcohol twang. 

Ahh, the bock malt is much more present in the flavor. Big fruit upfront--this has aged a bit but is not stale--plums, cherries, raisins, moving into a sweet, chocolately bock malt, and ending on more, very sweet fruit. A hint of alcohol lingers behind. 

Quite drinkable, in spite of its complexity and pop. I have no idea how old it is, thanks to my total idiocy, but I¬ím willing to bet that age has treated this well. The fruit complexities are great, and the alcohol is not at all overwhelming.","Waterloo, Iowa, USA","mynie"

Chocolate, plums, and cherries all combine for a chewy beverage. The alcohol is there but does not dominate, it works with what little hop presence in this to keep this from getting too cloying. Marshmallow granola flavor in the finish with sorghum molasses.  A fantastic experience.

Per the Reinheitsgebot there appears to be much consistency within the parameters of the style.  She pours a deep ruby red color with a tawny head that dissipates quickly. There is a surprising amount of carbonation, although hard to see, considering this is such a high gravity brew.   The aroma is not necessarily complex; however, beyond the overwhelming presence of malt, there is a good representation of a fresh hoppy smells as well as some stewed fruits.  The palate is defined by a somewhat syrupy start and the signature eisbock astringent finish.  The flavor is sweet and intense (similar to some American barley wines) with a defined crisp, yet delayed, hop finish.  A good, well balanced beer, but not one that bowled me over.","New Mexico, USA","igel"

Poured Dark w/ ruby highlights throughout, off-white fast dissapating head. Aroma complex. Hints of malts, fruit (cherries, I think) bread, and slight alcohol aroma. Big malty flavor, big bready flavor, slight fruity (cherry, and maybe raisins, molasses?) flavor in the middle and slight alcohol warming in the aftertaste. Didn¬ít even realize it was a 9.2% abv beer. Carbonation good, mouthfeel medium. This is my first Eisbock and I enjoyed it very much.

The flavour is what one would expect after experiencing the aroma: sweet cereal grains, pumpernickel like a barleywine but with more malt character, probably owing to the lagerness of this beer.  No alcohol flavour, notes of german hops, and some dark malt.  Medium to full body with moderate carbonation and not overly sweet.  Probably the best value ever.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"

Rich with plenty of alcohol vapors, prune juice, raisins, plums and dark chocolate, it was like a nice porto.
Low carbonation, it comes down silky smooth down your gullet, but the alcohol seems to just pop about half-way through your oesophagus and gives you a nice, warm feeling.  Flavors of figs dipped in blackstrap molasses, I was able to detect a slight hoppy aftertaste, but the dark fruits and neutral hard liquor were predominant in the final.

Toasted and bready malts, some slight smokiness(probably due to age), and a raisiny dark fruit character that have melded together wonderfully!  Some hints of alcohol in the nose.  Well balanced and port like in the flavor, but lightly so.  Clean, lightly oxidized, but it adds to complexity of palate.   Some dark raisiny fruity flavors, heavily malty with toasted malts and hints of deep caramel character that adds to the raisiny flavor.  Hints of alcohol, but clean otherwise.

On the finish a crisp smooth roast takes over, begging the drinker to have another sip.   Obviously this is a favorite.  It has served me well and since I just had a bottle last night I decided to rate it. Try this as a digestif after dinner of a dessert wine, it goes wonderfully with stilton and walnuts.

2471,"2005-04-04",4.7,"Dark, murky black/brown in color.  Nice semi-bubbly grey head.  For aroma, there¬ís a metallic twang (probably from the high ABV), which seems to cover up hints of roasted and caramel malts, and a tad of cedar that comes through.  Taste is very rich, characterized by chocolate malts and a small backend of earthiness, walnuts and protruding prunes.  Caramel malts play a dominant role in sweetening and balancing the beer.  Very full-bodied.  Quite possibly the richest beer in the bock genre that I¬íve had the blessing of tasting.  As it warms, the beer gets only better, smoother and more balanced.  You can¬ít taste the heavy alcohol presence until you get a small hint of it near the end of the beer.  That being said, you can feel the alcohol¬ís effect after sip number two.  Fantastic beer.

like the first one, the scent from the bottle was very musty and almost put me off but once poured into the glass the scent changed quite a bit. can almost make out a slight cinnamon roll scent! also something odd, perhaps a smokey aroma. poured a dark brown with small head. malt ¬ío plenty and i also agree with the vanilla/butterscotch mention. warm going down but this one hides the alcohol well. a very thick mouthfeel. this was a fresh 2004 bottle, have one more and plan  to age it a bit more if i can stand the wait. a very unusual beer, at first sip, didn¬ít know what to think. probably because the off scent got in the way of taste. tasting better as it warms up a bit. well worth a try, easy to drink, perhaps hard to find though?","Georgia, USA","kosh"

2471,"2004-07-17",4.5,"2/7/04.  Poured out of 33 cL bottle, bought at Stuffed Sandwich in San Gabriel, CA a long-ass time ago.  1996 Vintage.  Holy shit, yo.  Extremely dark brown-red color, capped with a very slight, tan head of large bubbles.  The head can be forgiven, especially because the beer does something I¬íve never seen before-- it leaves very little lacing at first (maybe because of the temperature?), then begins to leave the most elegant glitter and sparkle, like a thin, light tan metallic foil.  Aroma is lovely-- some grape (like the fruit and also like the artificial fruit flavoring of grape candy), cola, and faint chocolate.  Very delicious nose, sweet and luscious, a bit fruity.  Flavor is just killer.  Caramel malt and bright alcohol, worty.  Syrupy with grape flavors, but not very vinous.  Dried fruit-- prune and plum.  Definite alcohol but not off-putting to me.  Also some chocolate.  Body is medium-full, velvety smooth beneath but pretty sharply biting and sort of humming with a carbonation feel that I somehow don¬ít see.  I would guess it¬ís from the alcohol,  but I actually prefer to think that it¬ís coming from the gentle pur of pixie dust sprinkled on this magic fruit.  Finish is a lot of dried fruit and caramel malt, now resinous and always resonant, quite long and unique.  Excellent stuff.  Sticky on the lips.  I can tell this bottle is a bit oxidized, but it could still age a bit I think.  It¬ís certainly mellowed some over the years, but it¬ís still damn awesome.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

2471,"2004-05-22",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 20, 2015 My Bottom Line:
Deep Munich malts develop raisins and cherry jam before encountering caramel and delicate alcohol warmth in this elegant Eisbock.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam surrounds the darkest mahogany.
-Mouthfeel is luxurious while never being heavy.
-The finish isn¬ít too sweet, and even adds a touch of toast and roast.
-Hops are an afterthought flavor-wise, but I¬ím sure there are tons in here to make the flavor profile appear so smooth and not cloying.
-This is obviously based on a Doppelbock or Dunkler Bock recipe. Would love to try either, frankly.
-This methodically tasty eisbock periodically recalls great English barley wines such as J.W. Lee¬ís Harvest...

Pours clear deep red-brown with a thin off-white head.  Aroma was a very promising heavy raisin/prune combination, classic doppelbock form.  Flavor is a dead-ringer for Celebrator, with a rich raisin/prune malt complement leading to several layers of breads and caramel.  Alcohol is nicely subdued.  A stellar doppelbock concentrate.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

Load of malty sweetness, nice dark caramel and toffee with all sorts of little dark fruitened things in there with prune and dates mostly with some fig and raisin hints. Smokey molasses and banana too. What a fantastic nose!! Yum, yum, yum! This stuff rocks!! It takes over where the smell leaves off with the wanting of more! Huge amounts of malty richness, thick and chewy, not overbearingly so, but plentiful in its presense with great dark caramel mixing with toffee. The dark fruits are unimaginably yummy! Plum, prune, fig, and raisin, touches of banana tangyness; then there's some molasses spicyness with some nice little tid bits of smokened earth, brown sugar, chocolate, and black cherry. The sweetness is so rich and deeply dark its wonderful! Has a thinnish start and a bit thin in the finish and is over a little to quick, but overall this sucker is full and thick with a incredibly creamyness and nice chewyness, some stickyness with great lingering malty chewy sweetness leaving notes of dark toffee and tangy dark fruits on the palate.
