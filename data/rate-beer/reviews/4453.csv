4453,"2016-07-17",3.7,"2009 De Cam Kriek Lambiek paired with a bowl of cherries. Will this be cherry overkill? Let's find out!

This lambic pours a deep mauve, kind of purple brown with a fuzzy pink head they vanished fast. 

The aroma is incredibly aceitic vinegar cherry with some acidity and barrel woodsiness.

The taste is tart, oaky, nutty, cherry, vinegar, some sweetness and acidity with a dry finish. 

The fresh cherry sweetness, cuts through the vinegar by accentuates the acidic nature of the finish. I think I served it a tad too warm so I've got more chilling in the fridge or it may be at an odd moment in it's cella ring evolution.

Nose is full of sunbathed, joung cherries, just before they turn ripe, with only hints of acidity.

Lower carbonation brings out the fruit very well, without adding distracting metallic hints. Begins with sour, unripe cherries, tickeling the tip of the tongue, supported by a leathery tartness, helping to put the fruits even more into the spotlight. The sourness enhances while the beer warms up, resulting in an uncomprimising tartness, in which cherry notes shine through at a later stage, after the palate has been adjusted to the acidity. Gets a little sweeter in the end, adding a lovely complexity to the fruit, the cherries seem to mature during the drinking process.","GERMANY","aleigator"

4453,"2013-10-10",3.9,"0.75l corked bottle from 2009. What an amazing color this beast has. Its deep dark almost purple red with a medium sized pinkish head that eventually fades to a sidesticking filmy little thing. Its so filled with floaters and sediments that it almost looks like a pureed raspberry jam. It really wants out of the bottle this, no gusher but even after pouring a full teku glass the head still managed to pour out of the bottleneck. I would describe this as a 9 of 10 on the cloudy scale. It has a refreshing cherry aroma. Fresh and natural sourned with tons of wood and a little lime zesty zing. Acidity is also present in form of apple vinegar mixed with red wine vinegar. Lovely stuff. The carbonation level is above average and it has a medium oily mouthfeel. Lots of cherry flavors, almost like drinking a sparking cherry juice. Its also to my surprise really dry. Not much sweetness left here. A little bit of grass and herbs when its reaching the throat.

4453,"2013-09-24",3.6,"My Bottom Line :  
Boastful sour cherries create pie-like impressions on this lambiks brettanomyces notes and highly carbonated moutfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A slice of foam sits atop the dark red.
-Acidity levels are relatively light compared to the rest of De Cams lineup (or, at least what I know of it).
-The finish is quite soft; fruity and dry.
-Its rather amazing that the fruit character is still so very intense after all this time.

4453,"2013-08-31",3.9,"January 2009 bottle; Sampled August 2013
A steady pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a one finger thick, pale red tinged, full tan colored head. The beer is a dark, concentrated, deep red, plum color. The nose smells fruity, with a note that reminds me of cherry flavored, children aspirin, lots of cherry skin character, sweet concord grape candy, as well as floral sour cherry notes (carnations and a bit of rose), as well as a bit of fruity cherry pulp. The cherry character really dominates the nose, even after the beer warms up.

The beer has a light prickly carbonation, a tannic, astringent texture, to go along with a light body that has enough texture to it that it isnt anywhere near watery. This has a really floral cherry character (it makes me wonder if these use Polish Sour cherries), lots of carnation notes, some light perfume-like rose notes, a tart cherry character that lingers on the palate; in the long finish the beer is has an astringent cherry skin character, but up front there is a really juicy, ripe cherry character that can be a bit confusing as the beer is quite dry and tart up front. There is a medicinal note to the finish, a definite phenolic note, a lingering mustiness and a light funkiness to this beer.

I like that this has a persistent carbonation to it, it definitely helps to make this beer quite a bit more expressive. I really like the floral edge that the cherries bring to this beer. While the cherry character is dominant, the floral edge sort of accentuates the funkiness of the base beer, and the balance between cherries and Lambic really strikes a good balance.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

After visiting the amazing cellar with the owner, we ended up at our table with this lambic. When mathieuc opened it, it was the most epic gusher that Ive saw so far; 3/4 of the bottle went out in a 1+ meter geyser. Pours hazy deep red (beautiful) with little to no head and no lacing. Aroma is of cherries, not much tartness, light funk, light raspberries, light wood and subtle earthy notes. Taste isnt really sweet, but theres cherries, mild tartness, light wood and subtle musty notes. Palate is dry. Medium body. This fruited lambic is mild, but really complex. Very good balance. 8-3-8-4-17 = 4.0

EDITED. Tasted again on October 26th 2013. No gusher this time so the appearance (+.1) is much better (not murky this time). Theres also light lacing. Other than that, the rating stay the same. Nice balance between sweet and sour. 8-3-8-4-17 = 4.0

EDITED: Tasted again at De Cam directly from the vessel and this has to be one of the most beautiful beer I have seen. Bright ruby with a huge and thick pink head.

The beer is a deep, dark, ruby red with a soft pinkish purple head. The aroma and flavor both showcase the cherry. Mildly acetic and highly drinkable. This beer is quite noticeably different in both aroma and flavor from the 3 Fonteinen and Cantillon krieks I was enjoying earlier in my trip. The body is medium to thick and coats the palate more so than is customary for the style. A blend of sweet and tart cherries, with a bit of a syrupy character. Overall, this is solid.

Pours a  deep, dark blood red color with a two finger dark purplish-pink head that slowly settles into a lasting ring.  Spotty lacing left behind.

Musty, funky aroma thats bursting forward with sweet berries and barnyard funk.  Slightly lactic with lots of earthy oak and a strong horse blanket character.  Although there is a lot of earthy funk, the nose is still dominated by a very strong cherry/dark fruit character.  Its really surprising how fruit forward this beer is.  Smells great!

Medium bodied but filler than expected with a perfect balance of lactic funk, acetic acid and sweet fruit.  Surprisingly smooth and easy to put down considering how tart and funky it is.  Not harsh, overly acidic or acetic at all with only a subtle lingering vinegar flavor in the finish that leaves me salivating for more.  No solvent whatsoever.  Its just bursting with uber fresh cherry sweetness.  I can even pick up the skin and pit which compliment the earthier/mustier qualities.  Delicious and excellently balanced, never becoming to sweet or funky/sour.  Another great lambic from De Cam.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

How: Draft at the De Cam Volkscafe
The look: Beautiful clear dark red body topped by a small persistent pink head
In long: Nose of fresh cherries and barnyard.  Taste is intensely cherry.  This cherry lambic packs as much cherry flavor as a New Glarus Belgian Red.  And with the funk, dryness and acidity of the lambic you get one hell of a fantastic beer.  With such a great Kriek Lambik it is not wonder that De Cam Oud Kriek is also a favorite of mine.  Most draught unassembled lambics are much smoother than an assembled Gueuze/Kriek/etc.  But somehow De Cam base lambics are very intense.  I dont know why that is since he doesnt make his own lambics.  Very soft carbonation (normal for the style).  They sell this awesome beer for 2.30 Euro at De Cam Volkscafe.  I repeat 2.30 Euro!!! (right now about $3).  No kidding.  Is there a better way to spend $3 that doesnt involve an underage Thai prostitute in Bangkok?  I think not.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
