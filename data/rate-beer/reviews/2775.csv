2775,"2013-12-12",3.0,"1.5l PET. A yeasty, caramelly and buttery beer, typical for a Czech brewpub polotmave. Alas, this one boasts some strawberry notes as well. Medium, bodied, light sweet with a dry, bitter finish. Soft mouthfeel, quite fruity flavour. Maybe a tad astringent in the aftertaste. Ok.","Mikołów, POLAND","ElDesmadre"

Chuť má příjemný, sladově karamelový střed, lehký banánový okraj, fini je jemně kávově hořký a drící. Vcelku se jedná o příjemné polotmavé pivo se zajímavou chutí, dobře zahání ízeň a má vysokou pitelnost.","Hostivice, CZECH REPUBLIC","Jamedra"
2775,"2013-10-28",3.6,"Keg on the square at Jiriho Z Podebrad. Pours a deep Brown with a thick White head. Looks a bit like a pint of best with its smooth, creamy head. Nice caramel notes. Its got almost no carbonation which I like. Sometimes Polotmavys actually have a bit in common with cask ale. A full bodied, malty brew which I enjoyed greatly on a sunny Autumn morning.","CZECH REPUBLIC","TheCametron"

2775,"2013-03-11",3.3,"My Bottom Line:
Mild caramel and toasted bread allusions dominate in this dryish Polotmavé.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the deep amber shine.
-This one didnt have the malty depth I look for in Polotmavy.
-Hops are very light in here.
-The flavor profile was forgettable.

On tap at Zly Casy.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
