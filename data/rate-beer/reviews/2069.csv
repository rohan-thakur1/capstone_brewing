About an inch of sludge on the bottom of the bottle from its, ahem, extended lagering stage. Very encouraging appearance.Aroma is enticing, with lemon zest, vanilla soaked, honey-like maltiness and a nice tartness on the end. Oxidation is shockingly minimal. Fingers crossed for the flavor, then.A zap of sourness greets the palate initially, which then gives way to...not much. Haha, seems the yeast has been hungry over the years, eating away any semblance of sugar. The palate is soft and pillowy, with a light, but firm carbonation. Some light straw-like maltiness and a touch of grassiness are all thats left of the beer, other than the (quite delicious) tart acids that have overdeveloped. Still, no flaws and very little oxidation. Clean, no fusels or ethanol detected, extremely low on esters/phenols. Really just some straw and grassiness and the tartness.

Amber hued orange ale with solid cream foam. Pretty. Smells of sweet grains and some hints of hay, a hint of cream. Flavor is lighter malts, some herbal hops which are subdued and a slight sharpness like there is a hint of lacto or something - tasty. The flavor is pretty light and easy overall for drinking on a hot day. Medium on full bodied (almost like an amber to me) with moderately hi carb. Decent beer, maybe a little too subtle for my taster to appreciate.

Aroma: The nose has a mix of some spiciness, sweet malts, yeast, and fruity notes

Appearance: It pours a clear orange color with a medium off-white head and medium lacing

Flavor: Tastes medium sweet, heavier on the fruity sweet malts, with light notes of spice hop and funk

Palate: Its light-medium bodied, the carbonation is soft-to-average, and the drink is unusual, but refreshing

Overall Impression: 
I thought this was a pretty interesting offering.  The sweetness is most prominent, but there are clear notes of hop and funk here too.  While it isnt a crazy beer, there is something about it that I found a bit unusual, and that is the feel on the mouth.  It was hard to place.

2069,"2012-02-21",3.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 4/2/2009.  On tap, served in a pint glass.

Appearance: A golden amber color, maybe even copper. Somewhat hazy, and there was not much head left by the time it arrived at the table. I was pleasantly surprised when the head stuck around and left some nice lacing down the side of the glass.

A light and refreshing aroma of herbs and bready malt, with some light hints of citrus fruit and bananas. The smell is a little bit light, however.

I thoroughly enjoyed the taste of each sip of this beer. The flavor starts with some light herb and yeasty malt. There are distinct flavors of banana and mango, although no more fruit from what I can tell. The hops chime in fairly quickly, bringing some citrus acidity and light bitterness. I am left with the thought of bananas in my head, and there is not much of an aftertaste.

Although it has a lighter body than I would expect from looking at it, it still has a somewhat grainy feel. One complaint I have is that I wish it was a little fuller. 

A nice beer to drink while wondering when the weather is finally going to turn for the better. The flavor is nice, but the light body may wear out its welcome after a few beers. I will most likely revisit this one before Spring is over.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

First thing that hits is rich, malty yeast, which gives way to the spices and then the syrupy citrus finish.

I found this beer somewhat disappointing, and more and more am I realizing that I am not a big fan of this style as a whole. I just didnt see too much going on in this beer. It was perfectly drinkable, but it was merely sweet and fruity with some minor yeast funk. I like more funk and perhaps if I were to age this, the funk would manifest itself. Alas in the version I got, nothing exciting was there.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

2069,"2010-10-23",3.1,"She poured clear yellow which was a bit of surprising; I expected at least a tinge of orange or amber hues. Atop her yellow-gold depths was a delicate white head which in no way hindered her nose from capturing my attentions. Spicy, yeasty, slightly funked, slightly sourish, nectarines, biscuits, and topped off by a subtle earthiness. She may be lighter on the eyes than most Biere de Garde, but so far everything is stacking up properly. My first quaff is sweet up front and dominated by a playful yeast character. Hops take the back stage, though inbetween her nectarines, peach skins, apricots, and apple skins, they share a brief moment in the tasting spotlight. Spice lingers long in her finish, filling my breath with cumin and ginger. An underlying dryness of fresh sawdust and I immediately come back for more. Nectarines are the dominant fruit, offering an almost nectarinecello quality with a thick, warm, slightly boozy presence. Warm fuzzies are officially established. As I laugh merrily with the other lucky recipients of the Lips of Faith, I am reminded of just how lucky in life I am.

2069,"2010-05-04",3.8,"In short: A nice barnyard almost funky golden ale.  Highly sessionable pleasant surprise..
How: Bottle 22oz.  Consumed fresh the day of purchase
The look: Almost clear light golden body topped by a small persistent white head
In long: Nose is pleasantly farmhouse/wild and osier basket.  Taste of vanilla cookies, funky barnyard, leather, horse saddle, citrus fruits.  I could drink pints and pints of this stuff.  Ridiculously underrated.   I bought this beer to drink at the hotel when I had to spend a night in Atlanta because my connection flight to Rome was delayed.  This was because of the infamous 2010 Eyjafjallajökull volcano eruption.  Better known as simply the 2010 Iceland volcano eruption.  For obvious reason.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Flavors of toffee, barnyard funk, hay, hardly some light grassy bitters (just barely), stuffy banana and orange, perished sour lemon/lime, mild spices, and yeast.

Slightly to the wet horse blanket side of things.  Balanced with a bit of spice.  Interesting combo.  Definitely notice the brett.  My only real issue is how much I loved the old biere de mars.

Flavor has a bit more fruit and ginger. Some significant grassy bitterness and lightly tart cherry in a finish that lingers on a very creamy body, only the slightest carbonation but enough to lift the very soft palate. Really soft beer, but the more BdG I drink, the more it befits the lightly sweet, spiced style. This is such and so works nicely.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

The aroma is hoppier than I expected given my experience with La Folie, but figuring this is an American brewery I shouldnt be entirely surprised. The hop character is not massive, but assertive and not really the kind of hop I look for. Spices, gummy candy, and a faint brettiness are also in the aroma. The mouthfeel is a little sticky with flavors of citrus, cinnamon, chewy candies,and really weak brett funk in the finish.  Its hard to finish half a pint. The finish is compounding with flavors of apricots and some sticky, fruity sweetness. This is okay I guess. It certainly does not live up to La Folie.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
2069,"2009-12-25",3.5,"Lips of Faith bomber, shared by NachlamSie. Pours a hazy orange gold with moderate offwhite head. The aroma is leather, slight cheese, some eathy hops, and a touch of mint.

2069,"2009-11-28",3.8,"The sienna colored body was endowed with ample carbonation, the resulting rapid effervescence of which formed a two finger thick head in the tulip glass.  The aroma was malty and floral with yeast imparted spicy notes as well.

2069,"2009-11-10",3.5,"22oz bomber. Pours a clear orangey-gold with a medium-thin off-white head. The aroma is crisp and somewhat grainy with a subtle note of cider, subtle brett funk (at first - this faded after a few sniffs and a few sips), and some deeper malt notes. The flavor starts somewhat cidery but then layers of velvety malts enter. There is a subtle muffin-doughy/yeasty spiciness (cloves/phenols). The main character is a smooth and consistent malt backbone. The finish is crisp and somewhat dry with a malty and slightly grainy aftertaste. Bitterness is soft (balancing) and neutral in character. No real hop character. The mouthfeel is crisp and medium-bodied. Overall, this is a very drinkable beer - solid.

Definitely not something that I want to get again.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"
2069,"2009-11-04",3.8,"Appearance: Pours out a delicately hazed, light amber body with a frothy, medium-large, white head. Meager, spotty lace on the way down.

Smell: Sweet, breadiness in the nose smelling of loaf bread lightly dipped in golden syrup. The lemon verbana brings a notable citrusy waft and underlying garden weed herbaceousness to the mix. Subdued, easy-going Brett notes all around.

Taste: Sweet, lightly bready barley rounded out with a small hint of wheat and faintly nutty oats. Medium sweetness. The added lemon verbana certainly adds a fruity, citrusy aspect to the beer, but it also gives a little sting to the tongue reminiscent of consuming ginger. Splash of sweet apple juice as well. Only rather mild Brett flavors coming through at this point with restrained touches of just-made cobwebs crafted by talking farmhouse spiders, squeaky clean saddlebags, and farm-fresh butyric acid. Semi-dry, fruity finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium carbonation. Fairly soft mouthfeel.

Drinkability: With its somewhat subtler Brettanomyces character it reminds me of Ommegangs Biere de Mars release, save for the lemon verbana, natch. Id say I would pair it with some fine cheeses, but Id say that regarding just about anything, no, instead lets pair it with a fresh field green salad with heirloom tomatoes, sweet onions, and a bright, refreshing lemon vinaigrette.

2069,"2009-10-31",3.1,"22 oz. purchased at Macs on West Peachtree. Glad this made its way to Atlanta. Nice haze orange appearance with a head that fades away rather quickly. Malt, fruit, and slight brett aroma. Also, there is a slight spice, but I feel with this beer I am slightly having to look for the spices, but as the beer warms the spices come out. Ah, not really sure about the flavor. Rather weak flavor is you ask me. Slight brett taste towards the end. Fruity flavor with some malt backing. I feel like this one is just missing something. At times the brett comes out more than at other times. Slight lemon fruit flavor as well. Not really a huge fan of this one, but it is decent.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

Tastes malty with sourdough bread, orange, nutmeg, slight pumpkin spice, light brett to keep things funky, and leafy hops.  Finishes with yam flavor on the throat, slight brett, and leafy hops.

Aroma is obviously lemony and although Ive never had lemon verbena I imagine thats what its from. Comes off less acidic and more like lemon sorbet though. Also some sweet grainy character in the smell. Honey, graham, some lemon tartness, a smidgeon of bretty funk in the form of phenols, sweet bread, light earthiness. Rather complex for a NB beer but all the notes are on the sweet side which limits the drinkability a bit.

Flavor is similar to Avery 15s blend of spice and funk, though not as powerful, which is pleasant. A mild honey/malt combo sweetness leads into a slightly farmy finish. Once it warms up a bit, the palate is smooth and full. A really easy beer to drink, especially for something with brett, though its not exactly an easy one to pay for.","Houston, Texas, USA","jumpjet2k"
2069,"2009-06-22",3.8,"22oz bottle $9 which is kind of expensive but whatever. Really nice looking orange color, wispy head that is really just swirls of white at the surface of the beer. The smell of this beer is straight animalistic like sweat dripping off the bristles of a feral hogs back, whew its strong. Piggy, manure aromas, heavy brett and reminds me of Avery 15. A little prickly on the tongue but the taste is pretty refined, lemony but not sour, zesty almost. This was a good beer but given the price I wont be making a second purchase.

The aroma is quite nice, with lively hops, pepper, and brett mixing playfully together. Nice full body. The spice and hops are up front, but theres a very pleasant bretty finish to this one.

Aroma of soft biscuit malt, joined with sweet banana fruit, some funky honey floral notes, grass and some ginger.  The taste resembles the nose, starting with the malt, followed quickly by the sweet fruit and honey floral.  The funky and grass are present in the taste as well, though come across a little dirty.  Palate is medium, coats the mouth nicely, then the carbonation lifts wells.  The dirtiness of the taste actually led to a pleasant mineral mouth feel that ended dry.

2069,"2009-05-28",3.7,"12oz bottle, best by October 2006, consumed in May 2009. Courtesy FlacoAlto. Pours a hazy, glowing, orange-amber color. Despite a careful pour, a massive column of spongy, off-white foam erupts, settling at a swift pace to a lasting 2mm blanket. A sudsy wash of broken lace retreats back into the body almost entirely. The nose shows softly sweet biscuit and cookie dough notes, with a big, soothing infusion of flakes oats. Traces of vanilla add a dessert-like overtone. Dry, dusty brett yeast notes offer some farmhouse character, and hints of lemongrass contribute some freshness. The flavors are similarly structured, malty and biscuity up front, transitioning to some aged floral hop bitterness and dry, lightly dusty brett funk. The lemon comes through again, adding a bright citrusy note. The finish is somewhat herbal and green, yet remains semi-sweet from all the biscuity malt. Oats make a re-appearance on the palate, lending smooth substance to an already ample body. Carbonation is fine and lively, intensifying the peppery, bretty finish. A very fine brew, even if it is 2.5 years beyond its prescribed expiration. It just goes to show you the wonders that brettanomyces can work.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

pours a milky opaque orange with clumpy sediment. the sandy off white head is peppered with chunks of yeast.  the head sticks around for a bit and leaves behind moderate drippy lacing. spice in the aroma burns the nose a bit... bretty monster... cinder block, dust, lemon and cinnamon. there*s not much going on in the flavor other than lots of funky yeast....dust, metal/mineral, orange and maybe some pale maltiness.  it finishes dry and is completely dry throughout. even the aftertaste is dry and bretty. medium body with crazy foamy soapy carbonation which blankets the palate and coats the mouth.

Pours murky, orangy gold, with a thin tan head of short duration. 
The tight bubbles left a small ring on the glass as a testament to the maximum height. 
Aromatics lead off with an almost pungent wheat twang laced with brett. Lemony funk with earthy overtones and citrus oil-spritzed hay. 
The mouthfeel is creamy and velvety. The carbonation wraps around the tongue. 
The pallet is more subdued than the nose would suggest. The lactic component so apparent in the aroma is missing, and some sweet malt with spicy undertones take mainstage. 
Layers of dusty, earthy funk peel away as each sip finishes, and theres a decent amount of warmth that developes on the throat.

A complex flavor for a lighter style, but has a wheat funk that is not pleasant to me, and a fruity yeast finish.

2069,"2006-06-08",4.1,"Biere de Mars is a truly amazing beer.  It almost glows in the bottle.  This is a transcendent saison-style with awesome golden-orange color and great tangy, citrus aromas.  Earthy, fruity, citrus-orange and floral notes bubble to the surface with a subtle yeasty background and smooth, crisp, well-balanced character.  No overpowering spiciness like some saisons.  Ive picked up this seasonal brew for years now and it never gets old.  I look forward to it every year and toward the end of the season I stockpile a six pack or two in my fridge so I can have it even after its sold out.

I wasnt expecting a sour beer, and this caught me off-guard.  That said, its not bad.  The flavor is pleasant, and although its very strong, its rather cleansing.  It reminds me a bit of the lambic I tried awhile back, but its actually drinkable.","Overland Park, Kansas, USA","frizzzzle"

Pours a hazy gold. This beer comes off like a caricature of why many people dont like saisons. The aroma is grassy, some lemon, a bit of grapefruit, musty basement, stables, and funky outhouse. The flavor is all of the above, with the emphasis on the stables, basement, and outhouse, albeit with a bitter hop finish that unfortunately comes off medicinal than anything. I cant find much to recommend this beer compared with the other saisons that Ive tasted, and  as such I dont understand many of the ratings I see here. Perhaps as ""sethdude"" suggests in his Dec 2005 rating, the 2005 has taken a decided turn for the worse.

At first the nose was delightful. Sour grapes, bubblegum and a nice cracked and edgy malt flavor that was, to say the least, refined. This however quickly turned south. At first the funk that wafted from the goblet was palatable. Dead spiders, dusty corners and goats milk. But then...OHH...pure gym socks...over and over again nothing but gym socks. No subtleness only a nasty fungusy ripeness. This keg was brand new too. Flavorsare murky and confused.

2069,"2006-01-04",3.2,"Despite my loyalty to New Belgium, and my near undying fealty to their cause I had no idea what to expect from their new post-Christmas seasonal, the Biere de Mars.  Its celestial name has a mysterious scientific charm to it, and the label lends it an extirpated Gaelic appeal.  Also, Frambozen was a success, so I had similar hopes for the NBB Saison, but I was mostly disappointed.  The taste is spotted with citrus flavors, mostly orange, but is otherwise oddly bland.  The remaining background isnt exactly bitter as it is extant; I notice it, but couldnt really care less.  The texture fits what flavor there is nicely though.  If the flavors are insubstantial, the Biers de Mars almost makes up for it with its epic appearance.  The beer itself is a cheerful orange-tangerine color, clouded from one end of the glass to the other.  And the foam appears to have been designed by Sir Christopher Wren.  Half of it was piled lopsided on one end of the glass.  A talented sculpture could no doubt switch his medium from clay, stone and marble to Biere de Mars foam.

Brewed with Pale, Aromatic, C-40 and Carapils malts, all fairly lightly-toasted. Willamette, Cascade and Magnum hops are very much kept in abeyance here, with only 18 IBU. The malts dominate the smell and the taste.
Unpasteurized (as all of this breweries ales are!), unfiltered. bottle-conditioned spring ale on its first run of the season .
Semi-cloudy, orange-colored pretty looking beer.
Notes of orange and lemon in the nose, with wheat and maybe even oats. Taste matches, but lays a bit lower than the smell.

Flavors were muted and subtle, not like the Belgian Saisons that are so much more in your face.

2069,"2005-03-26",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 27, 2005 12 oz. bottle into tulip glass.  Purchased at Wild Oats supermarket, Omaha NE.  The bottle said this beer is dedicated to March, so I had to try it, since its March.  Smelled yeasty, skunky, a bit toasty, kind of like melon rind, and a little bit like what I thought was basil.  Wasnt that great looking: not much fizzy head, dissipated quickly and totally.  Effervescent bubble action with some lively but uneven ""racing.""  Glowing amber orange in the glass.  Tasted just as yeasty as it smelled, with that toasted malt apparent under a very appropriate level of acid (chewy, buttery fruit flavors: mango, pineapple).  The taste was spicy to me: cinnamon, basil, oregano?, black pepper?  It was acrid and dry.  I couldnt quite place it, but it was there and blended nicely with the balanced level of bitter hops.  The finish was complex: dry and malty at first, transitioning to fruity hoppiness after about 20 seconds, and resting at last into banana and then a mealy kind of funk that wasnt great at first, but grew on me.  Good powdered sugar sweetness in the malt, too.  The mouthfeel was perfect, the carbonation biting just enough with the bitter hops and spices, the body staying medium-light to complement the acidity to make this crisp and refreshing.  I guess thats the ""Spring"" part of March.  Enjoyable session beer that provides plenty of balanced stimulation without anything that makes you say, ""Wow"" (in either a good or bad way).","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

As with most NB beers (I havent had La Folie), I find that I slam dunk (dump?) the thing into their own ""worthy"" glass to attain any head at all, let alone the two fingers width their website advises one to acheive. Not to worry though, by my own admission I like the brewery enough to have purchased said glass. Anyway, this white head I struggled to create, dissipated quickly leaving me to taste this years batch. Wheaty aroma with an orange zest highlight. Very full body, which is quite pleasing.

The sour/bitter almost seems to overpower the grain/malt flavor but it is there and enjoyable. Light hops. Crisp & clean tasting, a bit spicey, slightly clovey & moderately complex.

(Previous rating, 1/10/2005) Bottle, Liquor World in Fayetteville AR. Pours very hazy light orange, with a nice layer of dimpled light orange head. More yeast floating in here than a typical hefeweizen. Aroma is almost all bready yeast, with just a hint of citrus. Some pleasant graininess in the taste, and lots of yeast. Nice light clean palate. Finishes with some fruity/metalic esters. I thought this was a pleasant and very refreshing beer. My only complaint is that the overbearing yeastiness makes it a bit one sided.

I like this and like others below, was a bit surprised at that fact.  This is probably the most interesting and adventurous of NBBs line-up, meaning those that they put in six-packs.","Nebraska, USA","mdi"
2069,"2005-01-04",3.8,"Hazy, golden body with a thin, off-white head.  The aroma is light and slightly citrusy, made up of lemon and orange zest, with bits of wheat, yeast, fresh baked bread and some lightly floral hops.  The body is light and refreshing.  The flavor is clean and enjoyable.  Nothing mind blowing, but solid and tasty.  Not like the most common US-brewed Saisons, which is fine by me.  There is no overpowering coriander or other spices.

No lacing to speak of, though I cant subtract any points for that.  Aromas are floral, yeast, apples and oranges.  Tasting yields a full, hoppy and rustic beer with a long bready finish.  Malt, hops, and fruity flavors are all held together by the yeast in sublime balance.  An excellent beer from an excellent brewer.  A brew to behold.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","jefcon"

Thrilling and tasty bitterness on the mouth, with a deliciously citric (orange, mostly) finish. Very yeasty, and quite well-balanced. Body is medium, hops are out front, but the brew is altoghether a rounded one. This is a very special ale, and when all the parts come together, Im left wondering...am I drinking some kind of liquefied orange bread?

Mouthfeel is great, creamy and full. Very earthy. 



2005: My God, something has gone horribly wrong!  Last year, I loved this one, and this year, its practically a drain pour.  Aroma is sweet and malty, tinges of citrus and beer vomit (I have not smelled this since college).  Also has a faint foot odor.  Flavor is disgustingly mettalic and unbalanced, yeast overpowers and unpleasant.  The kind of nasty you can feel in your nasal passage as you swallow.  Very unpleasant.  Plus, after drinking it, I felt extremely bloated, had a massive belching episode, and had incredibly foul gas for days.  Normally, I wouldnt mention such things in a rating, but I thought anyone considering this should know.  This years edition is a beer I never want poured into a glass anywhere near me again.

Aromas to follow are catty, light alcohol, and musty, earthy, malt and wet horse blanket.  Flavor is well balanced, with some toasty malt, but overall thin!  Fruitiness is low, and theres not much to the flavor.  Some earthy flavors up front, hints of bitterness in the very finish, aftertaste is rather bland, but does have some pepper and spicy yeast.  Not papery or cardboardy, just bland.  Highly carbonated, dry m/f, hints of warming alcohol, and lighter body.  Interesting beer!  Sort of a clash between a farmhouse ale and  a pumkin ale.  Seems to be some nutmeg hidden in there, but it might just be the yeast.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

2069,"2004-07-19",3.9,"As I carefully poured the beer to avoid getting any sediment in my glass I lashed out a quick ""dought"" when little floaties invaded my beer.  Then I read the label and had to laugh as apparently flocuant yeast was added to the bottle to achieve this exact effect emulating the rotating planets.  So with yeast circling around in the Mars orange to red beer with no head allowing the fruity aromas to escape the hole in the artificial atmosphere created by the goblet I enjoyed the subtle malt caracters complemented by the slight fruitiness of a typical ale.

Scent is light malt with a bit of citrus.

Taste is also light. Some citrus hints with some spices hide behind a delicate and crisp malt. I find this cleaner than most Saisons.

2069,"2003-12-10",3.5,"First out of the gate from belgianhomebrew's Secret Santa package - oh, yeah. Yeasty and sweet nose and super rocky head billow forth to greet you. This is a nice melding of sweet and spicy flavors, neither taking firm control of the taste, and the body is nice and supple, not too thick (yet it threatens) - yet, there is no element of danger here as in the great saisons, no hint of herbal madness stalking you and about to pounce when you aren't looking. Solid and well-constructed - I like it.  As it warms it is starting to get sweet like the dupont saison series, I think....","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
2069,"2003-11-15",3.9,"Nice appearance in my opinion, nice off- orange hue topped by a small delicate head..that dissapates to a nice lace ..this beer is pleasantlly hazy.
mm the aroma is strange yet intrigueing..i smell the malts and lemon but also some spiciness..nice though.
This beer has an odd taste also but i like it..it tastes a wee bit at the start like a triple..but soon loses that and becomes a robust lager..its quite crisp very odd but it draws me in

i think i can even detect some oats in this
Fells great in the mouth a taste adventure.
Nice drinkable spring ale..odd but I will have another for sure.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"
2069,"2003-10-20",3.4,"Color is a cloud of peachy orange, kinda murky with lots of yeasty chunks floating around adding to the murk. Small dirty whitish head that fades to a thin ring and lace is fast dripping strings. Smell barely has anything to it, just light notions of citrus and muskyness like a damp basement. Taste is mild in tone, super dulled citrus of mango and old bananas and peaches. Malt laden chewyness and smoothness with touches of mild spice and a dryish finish lending sweet bread and honey. Feel is smooth and lighter then medium in body with a nice finish thats quite subtle and complex in effects of its drying.

Interesting and novel citrus character presumably from both the yeast and lemon verbena. Nice peppery edge. Moderate plastic phenols. Lightly toasted, biscuity malt underbelly with honey tones. Fruity esters suggesting sweet bananas come to the front in the flavor. Considerable malty character for a saison with hints of butter and nuts. Also has a light woody character and a nice subtle touch of barnyard. Long finish with some mild but noticeable hop flavor and bitterness. Seems like it could be drier and fuller. Has a slight syrupy effect on the tongue. Does seem to dry out and improve with some modest cellaring.

Some mango and citrus in there as well just to be well rounded and crisp. Big, bold taste with a round malty finish and a nice dry ending. The carbonation level is medium and held in check well.

The color is sort of like F(l)at Tire, but a little hazier and a little darker.  There was some sediment, but I attribute that to my pour more than the brew.

2069,"2002-03-11",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2005 Hazy bright amber with light quickly fading head.  Aroma is citrusy and spicy.  Lemon verbena makes for an interesting herbal addition: adds spiciness, fruitiness and some lemony tones (note, there is no lemon in this beer, just the herb).  Flavor is mostly dry and what little malt flavor there is is rather clean, nothing Belgiany/Frenchy happening.  Light spiciness.  Dryness is puckering like a dry red wine.  Med bitter finish is a bit much for style.  Tingly mouthfeel with light-med body.  Moderately complex and subtle but could use more malt up front.  Nice but flawed.  Some almost over-whelming alcohol presence- not balanced by sufficient malt.
An addendum for the 2005 version, the aroma is full of brett, a big leathery horseblanket pile of cow manure brett! Good stuff. The flavor and palate are still a bit of a letdown though, lacking complexity and body.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (caramel, malt syrup), lightly hoppy (apricot), with notes of nutmeg, pumpkin, and detergent. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation. Odd aroma reminiscent of Thanksgiving time beers, squashy and nutmeggy. Some flaws too, though...crude malt character thats more or less New Belgiums trademark, and some soap.
