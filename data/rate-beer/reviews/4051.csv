4051,"2014-03-20",3.5,"Draught at Prohibition Pig on 3/15/14Strong white head tops the slightly hazy orange-golden body.Much softer and easier than the Zero Gravity Sim City Extra IPA I just had, thankfully. Honey, tangerines, lemon and just a touch of pine on the end. Medium to medium-high strength of aroma. Almost marmalade-like in its sweet and orange-like presentation. No alcohol or flaws. Perhaps a touch of blandness from the sediment in suspension?Light bitterness plays about a fluffy, very airy textured beer. Touches of wateriness, light honeysuckle sweetness and some vibrant tangerine-apricot-like hop flavors are all pleasant. Extremely dry, well-attenuated beer seems like it could actually use a touch more hop juiciness or malt sweetness. Just something to enliven it and balance all of this dry malt and dry, nearly astringent hop bitterness on the finish.

Pours a dark, dull golden bronze color with a wispy finger of white head and a thin collar throughout and light lacing. Aroma is straight Simcoe, with strong fresh pine notes and light citrus hops. Flavor is dominated by pine hops, minimal bitterness and a stronger than expected malt body. Not much citrus presence or bitterness in the finish.

4051,"2012-10-11",4.1,"My Bottom Line:
Juicy tropical fruit (namely grapefruit and starfruit) quickly gain resinous qualities in this lean and prickly New World Pale Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sizeable head of foam crowns the cloudy blond.
-These hop resins are also reminiscent of green peppercorns at times.
-Light straw notes appear under the hop bouquet.
-Resinous bitterness is lengthy but forgiving.
-Although intense, this remains a quenching hop-forward Pale Ale imbued with farmhouse ""realness"".

4051,"2012-10-08",4.3,"750ml growler from brewery. Growler 2 days old. Sample on tap as well.
Appearance : Clear pale yellow with medium creamy and foamy head. Lots of lacing. Stunning look as always. Lasting head.

Aroma : Intense fruity notes with powerful floral and herbal notes. Mangoes, passion fruits and citrus notes. Very slightly grassy, but mostly floral and fruity notes. Silky malty notes that efficiently round up the sharp hoppy edges.

Taste : Great malt backbone under expressive floral and fruity hops. Arrival mostly malty with the fruits and the floral notes coming in fast. Finish is slightly bitter with floral and fruity notes and gets mostly floral on the late finish with some malt coming back. Very light resinous notes coming on the finish.

Palate :Carbonation is a bit softer than on tap but still nice. Fluffy and delicate carbonation that goes down well. Palate was a bit better at the brewery and Ill rate accordingly.

Overall : Stunning APA along the line of Edward. Awesome floral nose with just enough malt to sustain it without hiding it.Big bold fruity notes. Very light resinous notes which makes it even more drinkable. Top example of the style, pretty much equal to Edward. Cant get much better than this.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

4051,"2011-12-12",4.0,"In short: An highly drinkable hop bomb.  Near perfect pale ale.
How: Tap at brewery + this rating for a very fresh 750ml growler consumed the day of purchase
The look: Partly cloudy golden-blond body topped by a persistent small off-white head
In long: Nice bright hoppy nose full of yellowed grass, light color fruits and dry wood notes.  The clean and crisp toasted malts offer just the right amount of caramel and honey.   The body is relatively full but it is so crisp that it feels light.  Hopping is bright and vibrant.  Bitter white grapefruits, dry wood, yellowed grass, tropical fruits.  Less piney and sandy than many other Simcoe IPAs Ive had in the past.  Bitterness level is in the med range and the long finish is also quite dry.  Im typing this rating as Im rating a fresh 750ml growler that I bought.  Earlier today at the brewery I had this beer side-by-side with the Edward (the regular Farmstead APA).  There are more similarities than differences between the two and I could tell that they both shared the same malt backbone and that Edward certainly uses a lot of Simcoe.  As I said they are pretty similar but the Edward offers an additional level of complexity that the Simcoe version doesnt have.  HF Simcoe is a superb APA, but when you know Edward tough to beat.  All in all, another kick-ass hoppy beer from Hill Farmstead.  I should drink a few pints of a nice session beer like this every morning when I get up, because my doctor said I really need to stop drinking big boozy beers on an empty stomach.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

4051,"2011-08-14",3.7,"Poured from a 2L HFS growler filled yesterday. Into HFS glass, pours a hazy yellow straw color. small head, soapy looking. clinging lacing. Smells piney resinous with a grainy husk and bready malt. sweet candy peach, apricot finish, no alcohol to smell. Taste is rich with hop flavors starting with pine going to citrus peach nectarine. grainy maltiness. finish is grain husk, touch of sweet wiped away by a moderate bitterness. no alcohol to taste. mouthfeel is medium body, low carbonation but just enough. touch of alcohol to feel. Overall an enjoyable beer","New Jersey, USA","fbm115"
