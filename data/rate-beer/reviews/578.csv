578,"2016-09-28",3.6,"Copper to brown in color with a taller beige head with nice lace. Lightly spices toasted malts and light fruit. I thought the color was light, but the scents are there. Quite light in feel. A bit too fluffy perhaps. Lately Ive been with #1FastSTi and not a big dubbel fan, and this one has me in a little bit of a quandary. A amber dubbel with a light spicy yeast. Interesting, but more a conundrum than an earth shattering brew. 1/11","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

California might not the first thing that springs to mind when you say ""abbey dubbel"" but this very accessible Belgian will stick in the memory after you try it. Affordable, widely available, and inviting, it leverages Sierra Nevadas experience to introduce people to one of the best styles out there.

Aroma / Appearance - A deep caramel body melts away under the short lived cream head. Malty apples, chocolate, and fruits highlight a chewy dense profile. Despite its weight it retains a smooth velvety undertone.

Flavor / Palate - Chocolate dipped apple slices tickle the tongue. A rich malt emerges next before the clean finish of dark fruits and delayed warmth. Sticking in the throat it leaves a mark that is not soon forgotten. I look forward to picking up a few more Ovila beers soon.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

578,"2015-01-14",3.9,"[from notes]. Very nice packaging (on bottles), very sweet story and all, but lets see how the beer is.

Appearance: hazy amber body with a fine beige head. Head had very good retention.

Smell: subtle nutty and yeasty aroma with faint hints of fruit and vague spices. 

Taste: The 1st sip immediately reminded me of Westmalle dubbel, but this past quickly as the Ovila doesnt have quite same flavor profile ... nor the complexity. Fruity and floral, but not overly so, with a modicum of spices that sit in the background rather coming to the fore. Nice semi-dry and fruity finish. 

Mouthfeel: Medium body; well-chosen medium-high carbonation.

Overall: A very good Belgian beer that can be said to have no flaws yet it is not up to the best. With actual monks and Sierra Nevada involved I had high hopes that were not quite met.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"

Aromas of raisin, plum, cherry, pear, apple, fig, caramel, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, light chocolate, clove, herbal, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness.

578,"2014-06-27",3.7,"750 cork & caged bottle - 

I was completely suprised to find this bottle at my local grocery store. This store is EXTREMELY small, and carry most macro crap, so when I spotted this for under $5.00 a bottle, I jumped on it. And what a really nice beer it was. 

The beer pours out a murky dark brown body with some soft ruby highlights around the edges. Sitting atop the body was a large, fluffy, 3-finger, off-white head. As the beer was consumed, it left behind a nice array of lacing. The aroma has a nice Belgian spicy yeast intro, steady raisins/figs and candy-ish brown sugar notes. Flavor starts out with some light to medium malty sweetness, a little nutty and raisins and it unfolds into a nice Belgian spice character that reminded me a little of a good English tea. Unfortunately, it did lack some complexity of a great Belgian abbey dubbel like Westmalle or Chimay.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

578,"2014-06-19",3.6,"Transfer from BA review from 6-3-12 - 
Poured from bottle into chalice glass

Appearance  Pours a hazy brown color with a hue of red. Upon pouring there is a big off white head that has a very decent retention. Eventually it fades to give a light level of lacing.

Smell  A strong brown bread aroma is the heaviest in the nose. This breadiness is mixed with darker fruit aromas of cherry and some prune, a strong yeast smell and a medium boozy smell. 

Taste  The taste starts out with a dry bready flavor. Towards the middle some flavors of dark fruits and a good bit of yeast cake come to the tongue. These flavors sweeten the brew a bit, but overall it is still rather dry. At the end these flavors are met with an alcohol flavor that leaves a slight booze burn on the tongue.

Mouthfeel  The body of the brew is on the creamier side with a medium level of carbonation. With it being more on the dry side a bit more carbonation may have been better, but overall its not too bad.

Overall  It is an OK dubbel, but nothing too spectacular. It has a more subtle flavor profile and for what you pay for this one you could find other more common dubbels that are better overall.","","Darkmagus82"

Opens with a loud pop and pours a reddish brown hue with a finger and a half of cream-colored foam. AROMA of brown sugar, candied figs and raisins, and caramel malts. FLAVOR of dark fruits, some dry spice, with light cherry and toffee. Only lightly sweet. Despite the moderately large ABV for the style, it still has a somewhat watery mouthfeel. Been quite a while since I have had a dubbel and this was okay, but a less rich version of the style which was a bit disappointing. I was hoping that the aging would do more for this.

578,"2014-04-01",3.5,"Aroma is fairly fruity with raisin, fig and prune. Light oxidation notes of honey and faint cardboard. Medium caramel and toffee. Faint banana note with medium clove phenolics. 
Pours a fairly clear amber with some copper and ruby notes. Medium thick, tan head that recedes somewhat quickly to the edges where it lingers. Light lacing and small legs. 
Flavor has a light sweetness to it with quit a bit of fruit character. Raisin, figs, prunes and even some overripe stone fruit are all present. Light clove character. Medium low bitterness dries out the finish just a bit and prevents it from being sticky. Some light honey character. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly watery with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth.

Dark caramel brown in the glass with a thick and frothy beige head. Aroma is predominately clove with light spice, candied sugar, and sweet malt. Taste is rich, layered sweet malt, raisin, candied sugar, and a tingling spiciness (perhaps the pepper noted in the beers description). Lively feel in the mouth with prickly carbonation.

Plenty of Special B malt at work here and I like it! The taste follows suit with layer of sweet malt, rich dark fruits, and yeast/hop spicy finish.

578,"2012-12-15",3.4,"UPDATED: DEC 16, 2012 12oz Bottle, purchased at Wakefield Liquors - Wakefield, RI. Lightly corky nose, with some soft cooked fruit. Warming, with a soft, bready yeast quality that I enjoy. If there is any spicing, its subtle and lays a foundation more than overrides malt and yeast flavors. The maltiness is clean, slightly Special B-ed, and lightly vinous. Theres a strong woody minerality to this beer that sometimes gets a little too peculiar and herbal, but otherwise I find this to easily be one of the better American renditions of the style, maintaining the softness that the Belgians get without creating too many harsh phenols. Update. After a while, this beer begins to leave a strange taste in my mouth, that I dont enjoy. I think its the weird corky herbal quality that really comes through strongly as this warms.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

578,"2012-11-02",3.6,"First I smelled the cork, which gave off a similar scent reminiscent of Port Wine (grape and cranberry with a slight alcohol fume). I poured slowly and watched the carbonation rise swiftly and form a slightly thick head, which reduced half its size within 60 seconds. I swirled the tulip glass and watched the head quickly subside the sides of the glass. Next I held the glass up to light and watched the carbonation quickly rise. Ovila Dubbels color to light came off as amber. Holding the glass away from light, I get a deep copper color. The head at this point is reduced another fifty percent. This is within 2 minutes of pouring the first glass.  
Holding the glass under the nose, Im getting, grape, cranberry, and cherry flavors. Again, reminds me of Port Wine. At this point, remnants of the head are clinging to the sides of the glass.
First sip is semi-sour. Holding the sip in my mouth Im getting that familiar Port Wine flavor. 
After swallowing Im getting more bitter mixed with dark cherry notes lingering on my palette. Four sips in Im getting similar flavors but the scent has changed slightly. The Port Wine scent I first experienced has subsided, most likely due to the beer lingering on my tongue. The scent now has become a mild spice mixed with sweetness of cooked or burnt sugar. I waited about five minutes between the next sip, now Im getting lingering fruit flavors.
Overall, Ovila Dubbel is a Belgian style beer I would by again. The changing of flavors is exactly what Im looking for in a Belgian Beer. Its not the best Ive had but it would be my second choice in buying American brewed Belgian style beers.","USA","adamhorror"

Prune juice, bready yeast and caramel meld in this heavyset Dubbel for a complex, sweet example.

-A veil of foam covers the cloudy ruby-tinged pale brown.
-Residual sugars are a tad too prominent for my tastes in the style.
-Mild black pepper notes add depth.
-Rum-like alcohol warmth and sweetness is present.

Appearance: Dark orange-red (almost a pinkish head) with a very thick, light tan head.

Aroma: Plum, raisins, molasses, clove and spicy hops. Slightly metallic. Boozy.

Taste: Somewhat sweet and syrupy caramel, dark fruitiness (plum & raisins), with just the lightest spicy touch at the end. Taste just seems muted overall.

Palate: Despite some syrupiness, this is way too watery. Moderately high carbonation. Much more warming than 7.5% abv would indicate. Finish is not dry at all. Wow, the mouthfeel really misses the mark.

Overall: Between the light flavor and the horrible mouthfeel (for a Belgian at least), this completely let me down.

Flavor is like nose, dominated by the caramel sweetness, although thats not over done. Theres some bitterness and a bit of tang to balance. Body is good and carbonation is a tad light. Finish is like flavor, maintains its pleasance and is of medium length. Good for slower drinking shorter sessions.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"

The aroma is weak at first, but does get stronger the beer warms up (I did let this sit for about 15 minutes out of the fridge before opening it).  The brew tastes like dark fruit (raisins, figs), caramel and bready malt, peppery spice and brown sugar.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its creamy and a bit slick with high carbonation.

It wasnt the end of the world but I am disappointed that a brewery w/ generally intelligent views toward packaging would use more expensive and inferior technology. I wish I could say the beer inside was worth it but it really isnt. It pours a slightly cloudy chestnut brown w/ only a wisp of head. The nose here is slightly tart and raisiny. Once tasted, the beer is a bit sweet and sticky and sluggish on the palate due to only mild carbonation. This offers neither the vibrant fruity, spicy yeast character nor the light but creamy texture of a good Belgian. A slight metallic off-note takes things down even further.

578,"2011-06-25",3.6,"This is a beer within a beer. Immediately calling to mind the infamous spectre of the Tucc de Garde, which none of you have had because youre all fucking idiots. Ive had it, thrice! Which is to say Ive never had it. Well, twice. Thats right, I just changed my mind thrice. No, I didnt change my mind. Well, twice. 
  
Back to the beer, or as I like to call it, malt concentrate, hop nog, or cream of yeast. This beer looks very gamey, and no less sinewy. This beer will have you tasting the curb before you can say ""Id like to get my pretzel prostate examined thrice. No I wouldnt. Well, twice."" The smell is redolent of old chair, crimson, carrots, rickety bridge, Crispix, clouds, karats, and the year of our Lord 1422, and by our Lord I mean Lord Byron. 

One doesnt taste this beer as much as one siphons it up the ass. And by ass, I mean your ass. Although dont let it touch the prostate, its far too alcoholic. But if one were to taste it orally, it would taste thusly: colon, cologne, Cologne, colonies, cola, Colgate (college), Spygate, Kolsch, coal, raisins, Colgate (toothpaste), coal ash, cold, semi-colons, Watergate, Colin Powell, and old chair. Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight. 

This reminds one of a mastiffs boner, in that it is immaculately conceived and complex in taste. This beer promises nothing and delivers everything, including gonorrhea and an above average credit score. This is a prefect beer, by which I mean it is only appropriate in certain prefects in China.

The initial flavor was somewhat to moderate sweet, somewhat bitter and moderately acidic; while the finish was moderately sweet and light to moderately acidic with an average to long duration. There was caramel, molasses, hints of chocolate, maple syrup, brown sugar, lots of yeast, spices, peppery, dark fruit, acidic, fruit, raisin, a little red wine, dark candi sugar, very yeasty, a little alcohol and dark cherry. The nearly medium body was a little syrupy, but watery syrupy, and then very dry with very fizzy carbonation and a dry and slightly alcoholic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

Nice biscuit character comes through with a bit of pepperiness.  Overcarbonated even for an abbey.  Body could be a bit fuller.

578,"2011-06-09",3.6,"Sampled on tap at 1702, Tucson; April 2011
The beer arrives from the tap with a pale, amber tinged, tan colored head that starts out about one-finger in height.  murky (not clarity, just adjective) amber color, light show clear brown amber hue.  aroma quite fruity with fig, prune and raisin eqasily noticed; amplified fruitiness goes beyond these notes even.  spicy clove aromatics and touch other phenolics towards end.  The spice notes end up being the more noticeable character in the nose over time, though the fruit still plays an important role.

light sweet, lots of fruit melds with big clove presence that boosts both fruit and percieved sweetness.  clove lingers on palate in a long finish, touches of cardamom and woody hints of nutmeg.  When paired with my pizza I notice notes that are peppery, warming alcohol notes, and spicy higher alcohols are accentuated.  Dark caramelize sugar notes add flavors of molasses, rum and a hint of butterscotch. A prickly carbonation adds to the texture and works well with the lightly viscous, sometimes chewy, though appropriately light body that this beer has.  A whole grain malt note adds caramelized brown bread crust flavors, toasted grain and a molasses wheat bread like flavor to this beer.

This is a good, if not great example of the style.  It is a style i have never really been wowed by though.  This beer is solid, even tasty and I am happy to be drinking this right now, but it just doesnt get me all that excited in the end.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

This is a style Ive cooled on in recent years, but I found this rendition pretty appealing. Part of this is due to the bright components of both the nose and the flavors. While the slightly cloudy brown pour didnt particularly inspire, the nose had a lot of promise, with more than the customary yeast-n-sugar nose of American dubbels. There was a light sourdough and spice element in there that appealed. Body was full and fairly smooth. Flavors were satisfying, bready and sweet for sure but with a grainy pumpernickel and fruit base that gave it some character.

Smell is white pepper, yeast, pumpernickel bread, raisins, and a bit of black cherry. The taste is more fruity and candi sugar, which sweetens the bready yeastiness and makes it taste more like a Christmas spice cake. Once I swirled the yeast around and poured the dregs in, however, the white pepper really came back. So apparently Ovila yeast = pepper. That lends a little sharpness to it that could be mistaken for booziness, but that thankfully resides and becomes more warning than anything else.

Very nice packaging involved, very sweet story and all, but lets see how the beer is.

Appearance: Pours a dark amber-brown body with just a hint of haze to it. Lofty, gassy, beige head. Though it thins out, the head manages to stick around for the entire undertaking.

Smell: Warming, swirling, shouting -- nothing seems to ever get this aroma off the ground. Just be quiet and happy with your indistinct, mild notes of dark bread, dark nuts, finely-ground spice, and a faroff sniff of cherry-flavor cough syrup.

Taste: Modest breadiness, then a quick drop-off into sugared sweetness and juicy fruitiness, with tastes of sweet cherries, raspberries, Anjou pears and prunes. Pinches of brown sugar and ground pepper up next. Slight toasted almonds, then a few cloves, which slides into a faint medicinal phenolic tone. And just when youre perceiving that faint medicinal phenolic tone, it subtly slides back towards the lightly tart berries, imparting some alcohol warmth. Drying, fruity finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-high, lively carbonation.

Overall: Ovila: Part One is neither awe-inspiring nor great, but its fairly good, though definitely falling short of the better brews Belgian (or the Belgian-inspired) has to offer.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

578,"2011-05-08",3.5,"Location: 750 ml bottle shared by NickD717 to begin a certain celebratory weekend, 4/8/11


Aroma: The nose is yeast, spice, some toffee, caramel, fig and other dark fruity notes

Flavor: The taste is mid-heavy sweet, with lots of malty flavors, fruity notes, and spice

Palate: The body is medium (leaning full), with average carbonation, and a solid mouthfeel

Candy sweet start with notes of caramel and pepper, with a nice layer of dark fruit and clove underneath.  Sugary sweet finish.  Thin to medium mouthfeel.

Deep copper, beautiful lasting pillowy head.  Aroma was caramel, hint of toffee, and apricots and prune fruitiness.  Flavor was essentially a match, although the prune fell back and dates and figs came forward.  Fruity, mild spicy phenols.  I would have like a touch more body, but cant complain.  One of the better American takes on this style ever done IMHO.  Cant wait to try the rest of this series.

Medium-bodied with tingly carbonation. The flavor offers caramel and toffee sweetness intermingled with moderate bitterness and a splash of medium sherry. Finishes minerally and very lightly bitter.

578,"2011-05-05",3.3,"I poured a 750ml bottle into an oversize wine glass.Appearance: Pretty shade of dark orange/brick red. Very hazy, but noticeable amount of carbonation. Forms a large, yellow, frothy head which retains and regenerates well, but doesnt lace the glass.Smell: Very mild nose with plum, fig, tobacco and general barley scent. Taste: Sierra Nevada is known for making bold beers and this is based on a traditional Belgian Trappist dubbel style, so why is this palate so darn mild? I went into this beer with my palate braced for shock, but was touched with a mild, malty, slightly fruit brew. Just like the aroma the palate is a dark fruit basket of plum, cherry, fig, red apple - all with a sweet caramel backbone. Ordinarily, this would be the description of an excellent beer, but in the case of Ovila its extremely mild. It has the complexity of an orchestra, but the volume of a transistor radio. Composition has a lot to do with the palate as well, as its an extremely fizzy beer for the style and the texture is noticeable thin and maybe even a tad oily. Theres really nothing overtly astringent, sour, tangy or otherwise foul here, and I wouldnt considered it a bad beer at all. That being said, its lacking the robustness it needs to work as anything other than an okay beer.Mouthfeel: Surprisingly fizzy and foamy. The head expands as it enters the mouth. The liquid seems thin for what should be at least a medium bodied brew. Drinkabilty: By far the most quaffable Belgian dubbel on the market. However, beers of this style arent meant to be slugged down as if they were fizzy yellow lagers. Sure, its nice it goes down so easily and is drinker-friendly, but more energy and spice is needed. Then 7.5% ABV is well hidden with zero alcohol presence in the aroma, taste, or constitution. A good beer to pair with cheesecake.Overall, a magnificent failure of a beer. Something that is genuinely difficult to dislike, but equally difficult to cheerlead for. It garners a thumbs up from me, but just barely.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Yeasty and spicy up front with some dark fruits and esters alongside. Malts arent plump, but work really well and offer some medium sweet caramels and a touch of bready toast. Plums, raisins, candi sugar, banana, and a light peppery clove. The pepper definitely comes out nicely as this warms more. Flavor is a bit more malt forward, but still pleasantly yeasty and spicy with a nice dark fruitiness. Caramel, plums, raisins, and some toast up front before some banana esters and phenols come in. Yeasty spice, clove, and a light pepper kick up towards the end along with a bit more of a breadiness. Candi sugar comes out in the finish as well while this dries completely, but it seems a bit thin with no real hop bitterness. The yeasty spices easily balance the bready caramels and smooth finish before leaving a fairly lengthy aftertaste. Medium body and a fairly creamy, higher carbonation. Overall, a nice dubbel.

The flavor starts with figs, caramel, and a Belgian yeastiness that reminds me of Unibroue, but a more mild version of Unibroue yeastiness.  The finish has clove, faint grape bubblegum,  and raisin.

578,"2011-04-22",3.5,"Poured from a bottle at the special session at Extreme Beer Fest. Apparently the world premiere.

Pours a medium chestnut brown with a light tan head. Nose brings some mild nuttiness and some dark fruits--raisins and a bit of date character. Mild caramel and bread in the background. Flavor is stronger with good fruit and sweetness plus some malt. Well rounded. Body is medium with light to moderate carbonation. Drinkability is nice. Good story and a pretty good beer.

The taste is very obviously a belgian yeast beer, but the remaining ingredients used separate this beer from the others. It has a very clean finish and the flavor has enough sweetness to balance the yeast. Overall it is a good beer, but nothing amazing.

Aroma of belgian yeast esters, some raisin, a significant amount of brown sugar.  Some fruitiness as well.  Flavor has toffee, caramel, brown sugar with mild Belgian yeast esters.  There is a fair amount of spice: specifically clove and pepper.  Mild fruitiness.  Somewhat sweet, with a mild bitterness that comes mostly from the spicing.  Smooth mouthfeel with soft carbonation.

Cork pops out of this bottle like a shot and pours a hazy brownish amber with a frothy beige head that leaves only traces of lacing.

578,"2011-04-13",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2014 Bottle.

First of all, the packaging is gorgeous. It just makes me want to try the bottle. Im sure its all cooked up by some ad agency and all, but dang it, it worked on me. Pours a buttery light copper with a decent though not extravagant head. Gently spicy nose is rather restrained relative to the flavor, which is a nice relatively-dry if quick-to-disperse dubbel. No sign of the alcohol in the mouthfeel though a moment later I can feel it warming my throat in a really nice way. Theres some house character here, Id lean toward to pinning on the hops though buggered if I know what is going on. Basically, you can tell its American dubbel, and not because it sucks, but because it tastes West-coast. What is clear that this is a very good dubbel and Im really enjoying the bottle even though Im not usually a huge fan of the style. One thing that is striking is that this beer doesnt have a single flaw that leaps out; theres some house character in that aspect as well.

Revisit in Santa Barbara summer 2014: spicy nose, fairly sweet flavor with lots of burnt caramel, again a bit more hop presence than some. Delicious example of a style that isnt a particular favorite of mine.

The flavor is spot-on for the style, with mild sweetness from malts that lend raisin, fig, and prune notes, as well as clove and pepper, and some Belgian yeast.

Starts sweet, with plenty of candy and chewy malts.  Some caramel and chocolate hints come through fairly strongly in the middle.  Becomes more toasted with a hint of roastiness towards the end.  The yeast surprisingly does not impart too much flavoring in this, which is usually my main beef with American brewers doing Belgian styles.  As a matter of fact, this is on the other end of the spectrum, where the yeast is minimal.  This is kind of like a chewy, nutty brown ale that is unfiltered and brewed with a clean Belgian yeast.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

578,"2011-04-02",4.1,"750 ML bottle purchased at BevMo in Redding, CA. AROMA / BOUQUET: Sierra Nevada have accomplished hard to produce bouquets at the same time: raisiny yet slightly grassy! Esters come through really well, with citrusy undertones. Hops are subdued but evident. APPEARANCE: Pours a medium dark brown, lively light brown head, with great lacing. The head is largely spaced with bubbles that collase in the appropiate amount of time.  TASTE: Medium bodied, definitive pepperiness, with overtones of cacao. PALATE / MOUTHFEEL: slightly sticky due to the Belgian candi sugar used in the brewing process. Fizzy carbonation, but I have always liked ""fizzy"" carbonated Belgian beers. The finish is a subdued nutty / pepperiness. Overall, a great Dubbel. The brewers at Sierra Nevada have taken their skills and created a good first offering. I see this Dubbel morphing into something greater as they receive feedback from beer tasters from around the world. Id love to know what the Belgians think of this one...

The alcohol is hidden. This is the only Dubbel my dad has ever said he enjoyed the flavor of, so that is saying something for the way it is set apart from other dubbels.

Medium body, watery texture turning creamy, lively carbonation. Tastes of cola with a slight note of clove and some Vitamin B (just like SN pale ale).

Basic cola, overripe sweetness, brown sugar, and raisins form the core of things; rather sweet and insipid overall; some modest clove and pepper contributions, but the focus sits on the cola- and sugar-driven core; reasonably high acidity; not bad or even flawed, but anything like Corsendonk would spank it.
