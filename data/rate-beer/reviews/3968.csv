3968,"2017-01-30",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2017 750mL growler filled 12/17 and drunk 12/19/16.Dark cocoa-ebony body is of indeterminable clarity. Topped by a large, dense, light-tan head with strong retention. Looks perfect.The nose is very aromatic, with just the right amount of dark malt character (which to say, is very light, as it should be). Hops are incredibly juicy, showing pine, guava, lime, mango and ruby red grapefruit. They assert themselves through the dark malts and the end result is a very lightly roasty, juicy, spicy, floral, highly fragrant nose with no alcohol or flaw.And so it goes in the mouth, with a supple, even slightly sticky texture full of a hint of molasses, treacle and mild, fruity coffee and just full-on juicy, lovely, bright hop notes. Pine and grapefruit, but none of the unwanted aspects that are usually associated with that (heavy resin, overdone bitterness, astringency). Ultra-tight carbonation and a soft texture, with appropriate attenuation leaving the beer dry but not too much so.Again just in awe of Shauns beers. This is a style I actively dont like and here its absolutely delicious and compelling....","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3968,"2016-01-18",4.2,"Growler. Pours black with a one inch, fluffy, khaki head. Aroma is dominated by hops upon the pour. Tropical fruit, some dankness, roasted malts becoming more apparent once the head dissipates. Messy lacing left behind. A medium, pronounced bitterness. Taste is not overly saturated with roasted malts. They are light, flavor hops being more forward, though the ""roastiness"" sticks around in the finish. Medium to medium+ bodied; average carbonation. Texture is a touch creamy. Bitter finish... Excellent. Just might be my favorite example of the style.","Michigan, USA","Mr_Abner"
3968,"2016-01-17",4.2,"Poured from a 750 flip-top growler shared by Gus. Thanks! The pour is a light black with a couple hints of dark garnet and a nice dense creamy head with some good lacing. The aroma is great. A light roast and a ton of hops. It's even got a juicy zest behind the hops. It's a beautiful smell of an IPA. The flavor is a little more reserved. There is a nice hoppy bitterness and a light roast. The mouth feel is a little thick and carries a surprisingly velvety carbonation and a lingeringly fruity and roasty aftertaste. This is is spectacular.

3968,"2016-01-09",4.2,"750 growler bought at HF 2 days ago. Didn?t even check what kind of beer it was, only thing I knew was thatI had never drank it before. Anyway. Aroma: great citrus, pineapples, chocolate and roasted mix. This is really fruity forward rather than roasted which is what I like in Black IPA?s. app: Really dark, almost pitch black, medium moka head that stays for a while and leaves some beautiful lacing on my glass. Don?t think a BIPA can look better than that. Taste and palate: medium body, smooth, really smooth, which I find rare in BIPA?s, fruity with this nice roasted and bitter finish. Overall: This is really well done. I used to be a black IPA fan and I?m not anymore so when I realized after pouring that it would be a BIPA I was a bit disappointed at my choice but after smelling it, I knew I would really enjoy it. This is how all BIPA should be. Great job HF.","St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Stoned99"
3968,"2016-01-08",4.1,"My initial impression was to call this ""balanced"" and Im surprised to read the commercial deScription and see how many hops they threw into this one. Black IPAs are challenging, and Ive only ever had a few good ones. This one is definitely one of the good ones. Theres some roasted flavor from the malt, but not too much that it becomes a hoppy stout. The color is pitch black, but theres no acidity or sourness from the dark malts. Theres a fair amount of resiny / piney / grapefruity hop flavor, but its not overpowering. Surprisingly restrained, very good.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

Doughy, flavorful dark malts mix nicely with a bright citric hoppiness to nearly nail the stylistic profile. Hints of sherry and soy muck it up, vaguely.

How: Fresh growler consumed the day of purchase
The look: Near black body topped by a medium tan head with good retention
In long: Nose is bursting with citrusy hops with some piney notes.  You can smell the rich maltiness despite the intensity of the aromatic hops.  This beer smells decadent and it is.  Body cannot be full with a luscious tick creamy blackened malts, like a not-too-sweet black cake.  Medium roast sensation, fudge chocolate, light coffee beans sensation.  Very nourishing body and absolutely decadent mouthfeel.  That fantastic malt backbone is complemented by the assertive hops bitterness that has a citrusy and pine needles signature.  Not very resinous, the hopping is all about making this monster beer more refreshing.  This Imperial Black IPA is  extremely as decadent as it is easy to drink.  This is the blueprint of what an extreme Imperial Black IPA should be, the execution is flawless.  Maybe the best hoppy malt orgy Ive ever had.

I dont know what to say about them. Theres no reason to talk about malt, no reason to talk about hops. One might begin to discuss the balance of water chemistry and minerals attained to showcase hops and roast malt in the way this beer does, but it kind of ruins the experience.

3968,"2012-04-20",4.3,"750ml growler picked up at the brewery yesterday. Pours a black body with a finger-width, dense and creamy, dark brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is big, dry, leafy, resiny and piney citruses with a moderate roast backing. Dark chocolate malts behind the big hops with a touch of coffee coming through. Flavor is just as awesome. Tons of leafy, resiny, slightly juicy citrus pines up front as a soft chocolate malt backing comes in alongside a really nice, moderate roastiness that gives of a light coffee and tobacco note that increases towards the end. Citruses grow as well with a touch of tropical fruit before this finishes dry, leafy, piney, resiny, and roasty with a silky smooth maltiness. Lengthy aftertaste following a soft and smooth, medium body and a gentle, moderate carbonation. Overall, an excellent Black IPA. Tons of fresh, leafy, resiny citrus pines and a really nice roast backing that gives off just a touch of coffee and tobacco all balanced with a silky smooth dark chocolate malt backing.

The aroma is very fresh with lots of pine and citrus with hints of black licorice and sweet tropical fruit. The flavor is a bit fruity and sweet up front with mango and peaches followed quickly by a very spicy, piney hop bite. the finish is incredibly strong with more pine and a slight roasted malt character that is balanced perfectly with the hops. The piney/spicy/dank and roasted finish give the impression of campfire without the smoke. The mouthfeel is incredible.

T - Starts off with some pine hops with some deep roasted dark chocolate malts with some light bitterness. Through the middle, some more chocolate malt flavor comes through alongside some citrus hops and a touch more bitterness. The finish is a mix of chocolate malt, citrus and pine hop, some bitterness, and a touch burnt malt character.

Pours seal brown, with a half finger of tan head, the bubbles of which sluggishly banish themselves to one side of the glass.  

An artful nose of citrus, grapefruit, sweet melon, and an indescribable mulchy earthiness.  More piney and cedary on the palateas with Jim, I get some Tsuga-in-the-winter evergreen, presumably from the simcoe.  Peppercorn dark chocolate malt backdrop.  The hop oils give the illusion of sweetness on the late palate, but it ends with a bitter and spicy kick on the finish.

Creamy, a touch oily, with medium, medium-low carbonation.

3968,"2012-03-19",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 10, 2012 Served on-tap at Shady McGradys on St. Pattys day during the charity brunch.

A - Pours deep dark brown, bordering on black, with a nice one finger tall khaki colored head leaving small rings of lace down the glass.

S - Smells of dark roasted malt, fresh cut pine, chocolate, citric hops and a light herbal quality. Good balance of aromas from start to finish.

T - Starts off with a big dose of dark roasted malt and some dulled chocolaty sweetness slowly giving way to a mix of pungent citric hops and some fresh pine needles. Finish is a mix of dark roast and hop bitterness, lingering on the pallet long after consumption.

M - Smooth body and strong flavors with moderate carbonation. Lots of roast and hop bitterness throughout. The balance of dark flavors to hops is very well done, unlike some of the other examples of this style I have tried.

O - I dont really like the style but this is probably the best black ale I have ever had. The huge amount of hops really held up well with all that darkness surrounding it. Awesome stuff yet again from HF.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
3968,"2012-03-10",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 3, 2012 My Bottom Line:
Roasted malts and citrusy hop resins coalesce in this harmonious, balanced Imperial Black IPA.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the blackness.
-Roasted malts ramify into dark chocolate and coffee flavors.
-As always for Hill Farmstead, the soft, natural carbonation and lean residual sugars create a very comfortable mouthfeel.
-Hop resins emulate pine needles at times.
-That hop aroma is something else. Leafy, resinous, coniferous, citrusy, etc.

Again the hops dominate the flavor, but in a very good way.  This beer some some roasted/toasted and chocolate malt notes.

3968,"2012-03-04",4.1,"Picked this up two days ago in a 750ml growler. Poured into a Hill FarmStead tall glass. I had been storing the 750 in the fridge so its pouring at about 40 degrees F. Nothing beats remarkably fresh HFS beers.

A - Poured a chocolate colored 2 finger head that subsided over the course of about 4 minutes with a nice creamy lacing around the edges of the glass. The brew itself is a solid black color but while pouring, you get the amber and brown color. In the glass, its pitch black throughout.

S - Im getting a very pleasant balance of  citra hops, grapefruit, pine and some woodiness. Maybe some smoked malts but its very muted and almost impossible to pick out.

T - Wow. This is absolutely delicious. A terrific balance of aromatic hops that light up the taste buds and solid malts that go down impossibly smooth. Holy moly. Im getting some floral and a bit of spice in the aftertaste.

M - A solid 90% carbonation on a single mouth swish. Its a solid medium bodied beer with a smoked malt and hop linger that sticks around for a very long time.

O - Terrific and solid. What an incredibly drinkable beer on a Sunday afternoon.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

Aroma on this one is really nice and big.  Being a Black IPA or whatever you want to call the style I was expecting more roastiness here but it was definitely a nicely hopped aroma more than anything.  Grapefruit, citrus,  pine, floral hoppiness.  Slight roastiness here.

Taste is just more of the same.  Big piney hops, bitter grapefruit and citrus.  Im just really really impressed on how hoppy this Black IPA is.  Its just big and fresh.  I picked up some more roastiness in this one with a slight bit of chocolate.  Nice bitter grapefruit taste left on the palette.
