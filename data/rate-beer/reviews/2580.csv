2580,"2015-07-11",2.8,"This beer with the approved label that the supermarket COOP has agreed, has an interesting historical background. It is in fact made from the 3800 years old recipe as archeologists found along with the hymn to Ninkasi in the former Mesopotamia (now Iraq). Perhaps it is in fact the worlds first written beer receipt!
It has stable creamy foam and an aroma of grapes and lemon. Slight hint of honey adds a brief sweetness, before a slightly sour vinous flavor of the grapes takes over. This mixed with citrusy acidity makes it a very different ale, which certainly does not fall in with the expectation of Easter brew. I certainly imagined something else, but welcome the diversity of the beer market and the fact that I once fell over a wannabe-bock-imitation.
This is a beer that keeps what the description on the back label promises. It is delicious on its own and very special way. There will unfortunately probably be many who do not like it! It can remind a lot about Mystikale from the danish brewery Djævlebryg.","Valby, DENMARK","TorbenJensen"

2580,"2012-04-23",3.0,"0.5l bottle from beermerchants.com Since its Good Friday and all, I suppose its suitable with an Easter brew. This one pours a light blurry almost glowing amber-orange body with a small quite bubbly off-white head. The aroma has yeasty, malty and a bit of alcohol tones, continues with some fruity and sweet hints. The texture on this one is light watery and it has a soft to average carbonation level. In the flavor I get hints of heather honey, its sweet but it also has a mild acidity. The flavors just seems like they are not blended, and they all go in their own directions. It ends light astringent and watery with a strange light sour-ish aftertaste. Not sure what I think of it as a Easter beer, but the whole bottle went down the good old stomach quite quickly, so I guess you can say that its quite light drinkable. 06.04.2012","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Dry and hoppy, really not that far removed from the Christmas IPA. Which was outstanding...
Honey and grapes are prominent on the label, but less so in the beer itself. I can live with that, and I think this is a really tasty IPAish beer. I had had it with lamb chops for the sake of Easter tradition, and it doesnt add much. Just a tasty beer in itself...","Odense, DENMARK","Christian"
