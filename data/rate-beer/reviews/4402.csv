4402,"2016-02-13",3.5,"Pour on tap at Crunchys, dark reddish black pour with off white head, aroma brought notes of dark cocoa, roast, caramel, toasted bread, hints of dark fruit, slight earth. Taste was a mix of dark fruit, cocoa, some caramel, hints of earth, spice, touch of bready notes, finishing slightly bitter.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
4402,"2014-07-20",3.2,"Bottle. Pours black with a medium beige head. Great aroma of dark chocolate and coffee. Thin mouthfeel with low carbonation. Taste is sweet with a slightly sour aftertaste. Not a bad dark lager, but the taste left me wanting for more.","Michigan, USA","eaglebones"
4402,"2014-06-10",3.9,"Shocked at how dark this was as I started pouring it. A deep black color even with the dark brown colored head. A big fresh clean aroma with a hint of roasty chocolate. The flavors match the aroma well with a nice refreshing drink. Very unique brew. A feel of a lager but a roasty quality of a stout. Leaves a tasty frosted chocolate doughnut flavor on the lips. Quite drinkable. Maybe it was just unexpected but I really enjoyed this one.","Michigan, USA","SpongeRuiner"
4402,"2014-05-01",3.4,"Ann Arbor bottle drank in FL. Nice dark brown pour with a medium, foamy tan head and thick lacing. Light chocolate and dark roasted malt in the flavor. Smooth mouthfeel with a little peat smoke in the flavor and almost a touch of sweet chocolate in the finish. Nice.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BelgianBeerGal"
4402,"2014-04-24",3.7,"The lager is black, solid black, like a stout, with a medium-brown head. The nose is incredibly smooth, with no immediately noticeable notes of lager yeast. Instead, its packed full of chocolate and a touch of coffee thats a smooth as fatty silk. Its even smoother in the mouth, and despite how dark this beer is theres only a slight touch of roast bitterness. The flavor is mostly a mixture of meaty chocolate, a whisper of espresso, and watered-down molasses. Its truly delightful. The finish is incredibly easy and just as smooth as the rest of the experience,with cocoa powder and a touch of coffee perfectly balancing the lagers smoothness. Craving a dark, roasted beer when its hot outside? Pop this puppys cap.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"
4402,"2014-04-11",3.3,"Its Shorts, which means a bottle recd from tectactoe, one of several fine Michigan traders Ive dealt with over the years: they grow them generous. 12 oz. bottle. 

Poured into my Cantillon glass: blasphemy, perhaps. Black as the name with a dying quail of a head. Nose is 7AM at Starbucks, caught me by surprise for a lager, plus an exhale of chocolate croissant. Very nice start. 

Black Diamond is a cross-pollination between a black IPA & schwarzbier & a porter, minus the hops. What? Something. Roast is featured once again, some slickness from the lager yeast. Tentative bitterness mid-palate, earthy sweetness round out the beer. Plenty easy to drink. 

Simple as an earthworm, but much tastier. Nothing groundbreaking here, just a good, solid brew.","Minnesota, USA","maximum12"
4402,"2014-03-04",2.7,"12oz Bottle. Wet malt and roasted barley aroma. Low on carbonation and high on residual unfermented malt. The roast is very espresso, dark chocolate, and old coffee. I think this has potential, but the residual sweetness and high proportion of unfermented malt sugars make it sticky, unbalanced, and a little bit cola-like.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
4402,"2014-02-14",3.7,"Has caramel, coffee, and earthy aromas. Nice dark lager with a thin tan coloured head. It is sweet, with minimal bitterness. Has a fuller body, and a flatter head with little carbonation. Overally, a very decent beer.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","BrianPopis"
4402,"2014-02-01",2.7,"Bottle. The pour is very dark, black. The aroma is crisp malt. The taste is true to the style. Has a bite to it mid way through. Average.

4402,"2014-01-26",3.4,"Bottle, part of a seasonal mixed 12 pack. Pours near black. Small tan head. Mild aroma of chocolate and roast. Flavor is the same. Overall nice beer. I would prefer more body in a beer, but sounds like this is appropriate for the style.","Coldwater, Michigan, USA","wmubronco1992"
4402,"2014-01-22",4.0,"Really light on the smell. A hint of malty woodiness. 

Looks great especially for a lager. Nice lacing. Nice dark brown color. Head is a nice dark tan.

Taste is great overall and amazing for a lager. A nice hickory note. Nice roastiness. Smooth going down. Very very very balanced acidity. 

Lighter on the palate. Goes down easy and tastey. 

This is an amazing beer. A lot like a porter but lighter. The balance on the palate really sets this one apart. Killer for the style.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Jamesthebrit"
4402,"2014-01-20",3.4,"12 oz bottle. Pours black with a light tan head. Faint burnt peanut buttery aroma. Light, clean roasty, earthy, nutty flavor with a slight hint of dark chocoloate. This is a pretty well-done version of what it is.","Northville, Michigan, USA","flatmatt"
4402,"2014-01-08",3.6,"It has a weaker aroma, but makes up for it in taste and palate. There is a well balanced with a note of sugar on your palate. For a dark lager, It has all the right flavors but none of the heaviness, which I like.","Belmont, Michigan, USA","bmulder87"
4402,"2014-01-07",3.6,"Bottle, in trade from Sammy. Dark brown with an average brown head. Chcolate, coffee, roasty-- drinks bigger than the ABV. Solid schwarz.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

4402,"2013-12-10",3.4,"Mild roasted aroma, with a touch of smoke. Pours an opaque dark brown, with a thin light tan head. Light clean flavor, with just a touch of the roast and smoke notes coming through. Very thin bodied, and easy drinking. An interesting take on the style.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","Nephilium"
4402,"2013-12-09",4.0,"Part of a mix-a-six for $10. Poured into a good ol shaker pint. Bottled 11/05/13. My first schwarzbier, that I know of.

Appearance: Pretty much just pitch black. A soapy little head floats on top, but doesnt last long. Lacings here-and-there... nothing really special, but looks alright.

Smell: Think of an old man with chronic halitosis who just took a sip of coffee and did that ""Ahhhh!!"" right in your face. It seriously smells almost exactly like that. I should rate this beer a 1 on aroma because of that, but for some reason, I wont. Okay, Im exaggerating. I got that smell on my first whiff, but now its just a roasty coffee and chocolate and ... molasses? sort of aroma on it. A bit of charcoal and alcohol there too, but not much. Interesting.

Taste: Coffee and roast all the way. A lot of char/charcoal. I also get a significant sort of nuttiness in the back of my mouth on the finish, which I wasnt expecting. Its really kind of strong for me. A sort of pecan note or something. Really no chocolate in the flavor. No alcohol in the taste or feel. Aftertaste is a huge amount of roasted malt, leaving almost a burnt but not bitter flavor along with that nuttiness. Reading that this is a lager, it sort of drinks like one. Medium sort of carbonation, and a relatively thin mouthfeel with the heavy burnt nut sort of flavor make this feel and taste different than, say, a porter.

Gotta be honest, impressed. I like the depth of flavor on this beer. I had no idea this was being bottle released this year, but saw it in my bottle shop and decided to give it a shot... so incredibly glad I did. Its reminiscent of a porter, but adds more smoke/char to the flavor, and theres that great sort of nutty aftertaste. Wish I had purchased more.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"
4402,"2013-12-04",3.7,"12 oz. bottle. Pours a very dark brown-- near black-- with a beige head. Aroma of dark chocolate, cocoa, mild roast, some mild dark breadiness. Flavor is roasty, chocolate, mildly bitter, with bits of cocoa sweetness. Full bodied, crisp carbonation, finishes chocolate and roasty. A top notch Schwarz, but thats to be expected from Shorts.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
4402,"2013-11-28",2.9,"Sampled from a bottle, 
a fast pour of this dark beer into the glass gave a one finger tan head that receded to spotty cover and small ring, 
it was a dark red with lots of dark brown-black shades when held against a light, 

there were roasted malt like aromas, coffee, faint dried dark fruit notes and some chocolate that added a touch of sweetness, 

it had flavors of roasted malt with some coffee and faint dry chocolate, 
the finish did not have any bitterness, there was not a lot of sweetness in this drink, 

the mouth feel was light and it felt a little flat, it was not creamy feeling and appeared to be under carbonated, 

a simple schwarzbier with a light nose and flavor, I thought the nose was better than the flavor, I was disappointed.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"
4402,"2013-11-28",3.7,"bottle. Near black with small head. Bordering on a light bodied stout. Rich toasted malt. Dry with good flavor. I wasnt expecting to like this as much as I did.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"

4402,"2013-11-07",4.0,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 10/3/2013. Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a small dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, light char, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes with light-moderate yeast ester presence; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, light char, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, light char, toast, dark bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors with light-moderate yeast esters; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice schwarzbier! All around nice robustness, balance, and complexity of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

4402,"2013-11-05",3.7,"Looks like a stout, but taste is more like a light black ale. Mouth feel and taste are excellent, but not getting much in the way of aroma. Good addition to the Shorts winter variety pack!","Michigan, USA","knezek"
