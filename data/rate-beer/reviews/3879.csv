3879,"2017-02-10",3.4,"Can... Pours lightly hazy and yellow with small, brief, white head. The aroma delivers a truckload of citrus and fuzzy stone-fruits. Medium-bodied with modest carbonation. The flavor is medium to heavily bitter with a slight garlic component. Musky, moderately bitter, lengthy finish. I like more balance. More malt character. Bottle courtesy of landhoney!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3879,"2017-01-26",4.2,"Really hazy golden color with off-white head. Aroma is really dank and vegetal with spinach, cabbage and chives. Taste follows, really vegetal, oniony, herbal, medium bitterness on the finish. Full bodied, really smooth on the palate. A really dank IPA, smooth and extremely hoppy.","Timisoara, ROMANIA","ciocanelu"
3879,"2016-12-03",4.1,"Had only had the Citra and that was some time ago. This seems more tropical fruit than straight citrus. Still hazy and sweet, slight astringency in there and a little dankness.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
3879,"2016-11-26",4.2,"On tap at The Gingerman, Manhattan, New York, USA. A hazy golden/orange coloured pour with a medium white head on top. Hoppy, citrus, tropical fruit, orange, on the nose.

3879,"2016-10-29",4.0,"Murky tawny pour with soapy white head. Ooh, nose is rife with crystallized weed leaf (havent gotten that in any Tree House or Tired Hands IPAs), and some light fruit pulp. Mouth is big upfront with more weed leaf, bitter throughout, with some meaty peach/apple. I like this style of IPA more than the ""juice bomb"" IPAs that are overly sweet and sometimes overly dull. Mouthfeel is nice but not quite as ""soft"" as the Tree House stuff. Dang good though.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
3879,"2016-10-23",4.2,"Can into a pilsner glass showing lightly filtered tangerine orange with a finger of quickly dissipating white foam.

Thanks Kevin.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"
3879,"2015-09-29",4.2,"Tasted several times throughout September 2015. Pours deep orange with a thick off-white head that slowly recedes to average, rocky lace. The nose is the super-dank, herbal, and almost over-ripe melon aroma that I associate with the mosaic hop, with just a bit of bread malt playing backbone. The flavor is even more of the super ripe tropical fruit and melon, with the lightly bitter herbal note taking a back seat, and a bit more caramel and bread malt than on the nose. The body is medium with lively carbonation and a long, lightly bitter tropical fruit and lightly malty finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
