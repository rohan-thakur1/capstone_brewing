2987,"2016-12-07",3.3,"Avec son mignon petit diablotin rouge sur sa bouteille noire, complètement opaque, on sent immédiatement le marketing de la brasserie grain dorge (propriété de la brasserie du Gayant) pointer son nez. Pourtant à la lecture de létiquette, lutilisation de malt dorge, davoine blanche, de seigle et décorces dorange dans la recette aurait plutôt tendance à rassurer. En verre, la Belzebuth 8.5 est dorée et limpide (EBC de 13) avec une effervescence peu marquée, des bulles peu fines, et une mousse blanche la nappant de quelques mm. Le nez est agréable et se porte essentiellement sur les céréales, la coriandre et le miel. A la dégustation, lattaque est fraîche sur les céréales et le citron. En deuxième bouche apparaît lamertume, moyennement intense (19 EBU) mais très fleuri et aux accents de pommes. Larrière bouche présente quant à elle de belles notes de fruits jaunes et de miel. Le final est quant à lui en très léger déséquilibre avec une présence plus marquée de lalcool (8,5 % Abv) et quelques pointes épicées. En conclusion, ce nest pas une diablesse mais bien un diablotin qui se présente devant nous. ET si lensemble est plutôt relativement homogène et agréable, il ny a pas de quoi se damner pour cette Belzebuth 8. non plus!","FRANCE","jybi"

2987,"2016-07-17",2.6,"One of the new incarnations of this well-known French strong beer brand, bottle from a shop in Bastogne. Creamy, irregular, egg-white head retaining densely on the edges but thinning quickly in the middle, clear deep old gold colour with medium fizz. Aroma of honey waffles, candied banana, dry bitter herbs, flowers, hint of iron, sugar corn, touch caramel, orange liqueur, white pepper, young jenever. Sweet onset, residual white candi sugar, but low in fruitiness so I suspect this is bottom-fermented; minerally accents, sharpish carbonation with slightly souring effect. Honeyish and lightly caramelly malt middle, slick and full, spicy accents announcing a finish of ongoing malt sweetness dried by some leafy hop bitterness but more so by strong, gin-like alcohol, burning a bit on the back of the tongue and becoming unpleasantly astringent way at the back (fortunately not sooner). Too sweet, too straightforward and definitely way too alcoholic for me, basically alcoholics swill from a fancy (albeit rather naive) bottle instead of the cheap tin cans I usually encounter this usually cheerless beer style in, but I admit I had worse Euro strong lagers than this so I reckon it is above average for its specific style and intended audience.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
