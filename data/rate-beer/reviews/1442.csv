1442,"2015-12-13",3.6,"I acquired this lovely by way of a friend down in Southern California, oddly enough. Since I am much closer to Loveland, Colorado, it does seem a bit funny. Sort of like leaving Boise, Idaho and having a layover in San Francisco for two hours on your way to South Carolina. Funny, and not so funny. (How many of you are visualizing the geography and getting it right?) Ah well, its in my hands now, this Big Bad Wolf from Grimm Brothers Brewhouse, and Im about to tell you what I think of it.
- I pour the beer into the glass, the aroma is malty, light caramel and sweet dough. The visual is pleasing enough; a dark, clear copper liquid capped with a thick, khaki head. The foam is four fingers deep, partly because of an aggressive pour, but mostly just because this is a style that tends to have a thick head. Hmmm. Leaving that alone...
- The beer is hop-forward in taste and flavor, but pretty much nowhere on the nose, so a bit of a surprise when I pull the initial quaff. The sweetness of the beer is full of raisins and caramel, ripe pears becoming evident in the exhale, but although its a nice bitter at the front, it does turn a bit flat on the swallow. And...I let this get too warm. The body is well carbed and quite heavy enough to carry the flavor, but too warm and it falls apart. After a chilled re-pour, Im enjoying it again and my spirits are lifted. There is a bit of booziness in this Altbier, but it doesnt assault my taste buds, or my tongue. Its actually a nice, mellow burn on my tongue that makes this quite pleasant.
- Ill have to admit that I wasnt expecting to enjoy this beer. Id never heard of it, or its brewery, and the bottle art seemed a bit archaic. (of course it did! Its based on an old Grimm fairy tale. Have any of you ever read the originals? Fucking creepy!) Anyway, this is just a straight forward, nicely done Altbier. If I was in the market for this style, Id very likely buy this one again, and Ill have to watch for Grimm Brothers Brewhouse in the future! Id love to see what else they can do...","USA","lightbias"

1442,"2014-01-02",3.5,"Dark amber color - very dense, sweet, strong beer, but represents the style well - very deep notes of dark bread (pumpernickel, rye), toffee, and dark fruit (raisin, fig), as well as bread pudding (treacle) and a hop bitterness that keeps the sweetness from becoming cloying - the alcohol is a bit too present in the finish, but otherwise a strong showing.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
