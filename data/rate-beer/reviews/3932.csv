Initial has a mild sourness / mid amps up the sour notes a bit / finish dissipates so quickly. Thin and somewhat astringent. Interesting stuff. A very restrained sour beer, without much of an acid attack. Maybe a session sour?","Hirakata, JAPAN","maekchu"

3932,"2013-06-09",3.8,"Bottle, acquired through trade -- thanks Aaron!  Label art on this bottle is fantastically cool.  Seriously.  Anyway, aroma is bright, floral, tart, fruity.  Hazy pale pour with a pinkish hue.  Sweet tart (like the candy, if they made pomegranate flavor -- at least, so I presume, as I dont eat a lot of pomegranate) taste, nicely integrated acidity.  Light body, crisp mouthfeel, lively carbonation.  Overall: great summer beer, wish I had more of these.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

Fizzy lightish body. Light lemony acidity balanced with sweeter fruit and floral notes. Beautifully light, crisp, refreshing, and delicious. Wish I had a couple cases for summer.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

3932,"2013-03-12",3.9,"22oz bottle purchased from Belmont Station. Was nice to randomly find it on the shelf since Ive wanted to try this for awhile. Split.

A: Pale pink like a zinfandel with no appreciable head. No legs. This is almost translucent as you might expect.

N: Hibiscus, pomegranate, raspberries. The fruit is very dominant here, though theres some sweetness that lends a kind of kool-aid smell. Vinous white wine grapes. 

T: Tart raspberries, pomegranates, lemons, white wine grapes, and a little bit of leather. Some lactic acid, and the hibiscus is appreciable if faint.

M: Very light and goes down as quickly as a Berliner Weisse should.

O: So, I confess that I thought this was a sour ale, and not a BW at first, and its funny how reading the label drastically changed my perception of this. Its a great beer that showcases the pomegranate and hibiscus well. Even nicer that I get touches of raspberries even if they arent actually present in the beer. I dare say you wont be disappointed.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

Still needs work on fermentation temp  slightly too sour and not just all dough and lactobacillus. Phlegmy lactic palate. Sad oxidation from the growler.

3932,"2011-11-10",2.4,"On tap at the brewery. The aroma was disjointed as the pomegranate did not work here and maybe clashed with the hibiscus.  Pinkish color was hazy.

Nose... delightfully fruity and wheat-like with the pomegranate really coming through! Palate... wonderfully tart, acidic and spritely with waves of pomegranate, general tropical fruits and subtle hints of the hibiscus and wheat though not much funk (which is fine with me in this case!).

3932,"2011-10-03",3.4,"UPDATED: NOV 1, 2011 Judging bottle from GABF (brewers afterparty) as well as samples at the festival itself. Pours with a slightly hazy pink hue with a small white head. Aromas are floral and slightly juicy with a bit of wheat and a strong lactic note. Flavors are quite sour (lactic and malic). No real funk too it, but some juicy fruit notes that I cannot quite identify. Lightly floral/tangy hibiscus like notes Light body with medium high carbonation. Clean lactic acidity. Pretty good.  Notes from the floor:  Lightly hazed yellow to slightly pink hue with a white head. Aromas are sweet, jammy, lactic, herbal, spice, pomegranate. Flavors are lactic acidic and quite strongly so.
