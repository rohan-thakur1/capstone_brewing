3307,"2017-03-24",3.9,"Hazy pale golden, average white head shows nice persistence and leaves very nice lacing. Aroma of cereal, honey, delicate lemonish fruitiness and slight grassiness. A delicate aroma gives way to a mild but rich taste with lots of flavours showing up here and there. Cereal, slight crackery crispness, honey, lemonish fruitiness (probably the one standing out), flowery hops, slight grassiness, a slight mineral feel. Overall the beer feels a bit more fruity and sweet than the average keller, but its still a perfect example of drinkability, with a rustic touch to it. Light bodied with delicate carbonation, very smooth and easy, even slightly oily. Overall it is kind of mild, but it drinks so quickly, its superbly pleasant, and has its own underlying complexity. Great stuff.","ITALY","ozzatoadisback"

3307,"2014-05-21",4.1,"Draught half-liter at Franconian Bierfest Nürnberg, June 2013: Hazy pale golden. Fluffy, creamy, fully sustained white head. Elegant nose of lemon oil, wildflower honey, canydish yeast, new-mown hay, lemongrass and a perfect touch of sulfurous rusticity. Firm and snug carbonation. Quite juicy and supple, initially, with a pineapple marmalade hoppiness laced with stiff minerals. Dry pils malt flavors proceed with finesse, lending a refined tandem of fresh cracker and new-mown hay. Rustic mouth-filling yeast accentuates the snappy minerals. Sharp and zestful lemongrass dries out the body as the deeply spicy hops ooze with flowery and candyish lemon-tinged oils. Mineralic pizazz precedes succulent honeydew melon juices and wildflower honey which lend yet another layer of intrigue and artfulness. Finishes yeasty yet unobtrusively so, and squeaky clean with a remarkably vibrant fusion of herbaceous hops and weightless but well-textured new-mown-hay pils malt. Well, all I can say is that repeat glasses were in order after first getting my lips around the glass of this fine nectar. A lip-smacking, mineral-rich kellerbier featuring stunningly polished hops and adeptly extracted, finespun malt. Its the ""discovery"" of beers like this that warrant repeat trips to Franconia.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
