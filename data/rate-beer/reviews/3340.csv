It was not initially too complex mostly smelling of ting but then it opened up nicely. Flavor is decent. Bit of medicinal herb, much sweeter than I was anticipating, it again is grapefruit dominant, and a touch dank/minty. Too sweet and not bitter enough for a session ipa but it is god for what it is though the price point was shit, you can buy 6 packs of world class session ipas for a few more bucks than this bottle.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

The pour is a foggy bright orangey straw color with a thin film of off white head and some solid lacing as it falls. The aroma is good. There is a nice juiciness to it and a light dank, yet citrusy hop. The Amarillo stands out for the dank see and aromas that Im not crazy about. It finishes dry and bitter. The flavor is hoppy up front, but then the combination of hops just start to fight each other. There is a dank bitterness from the Amarillo, and then the citrus and bright floral hops try to fight through unsuccessfully. In the end its just not that great. There is a disappointingly plain light hop finish and a dryness to it. The mouth feel is thin and light with a lint carbonation and a lingeringly hoppy smorgasbord.

Anyways, the gold ale has big potent juicy tropical fruit hops of pineapple, tangerine, clementine. Some fresh juicy peaches. Lifts quite a bit. Very inviting. Hint of grapefruit, pine bitterness but quite restrained and balanced nicely by the juiced up tropical fruit sweetness. If one hop stands out amongst all the hops used it is perhaps the Nelsen sauvin maybe. Perfectly moderately dry. Very pleasant combination of freshly squeezed tropical fruits, oranges, pineapple with a hint of grapefruit zest to make things interesting. No booze notes. Pleasant neutral malt backing lets hops bo shine. This is a fun juicy chuggable tame Pete to be sure.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"

3340,"2015-06-22",3.8,"Bottled 5/29/15, from the brewery, drunk 6/22/15Big pine aroma right out of the gate, but its highly pleasant and combines with mango, pineapple and dry citrus with bare, very well-attenuated cracker-like malts in the background. Juicy and yet very dry, with no blandness from yeast or hop particulate nor any huskiness from the grain. No alcohol noted, nor flaws.Diving in to it, its zesty and tangy, with a big tangerine and unripened peach flavor that is flavorful yet dosent overpower the very light maltiness present. I do get a bit of b vitamin and some popcorn-like astringency, unfortunately, but its fairly minor and these hops are so delicious that its hard to complain. Lemons, limes, cherries, and a good measure of pine bitterness, but it trails off before it has a chance to fatigue the palate, thankfully. Very, very dry, perhaps a touch too much so? With tight carbonation and a lightly grainy texture. No alcohol noted, of course. Sticking my nose back in the snifter, after some more warming, I think I do actually get a little bit of the darjeeling aroma that people have mentioned, but thats not really surprising, both being a very aromatic, citrusy, dried leaf. The beer definitely improves with warming, gaining some sweetness, yet also more pine acidity from the simcoe.Minimally hazy, pale, white-gold body with some light peach tints and a good-sized white head that fades to cover.Nicely assertive session IPA. Maybe a bit too heavy-handed with the simcoe and some minor astringency problems on the finish, but the hops are complex and interesting in both the nose and flavor.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3340,"2015-06-19",4.7,"Nose is honeydew, mango, apricot, lemon zest. Flavor is same plus orange marmalade, faint biscuity malt, soft grassy bitterness. Delicate, but not watery or astringent as some session ipas tend to be.","brooklynzzzzz, New York, USA","hopwine"
3340,"2015-06-14",4.1,"Bottle two weeks old. Pours slight hazy straw with a soft lasting head and great lace. Aroma is delightful and complicated hops over a dusting of dry grain--dank, citrus juice and pith, almost ripe tropical florals, slight herbaceous. Flavor is a light citrus and not yet ripe tropical fruit and mild bitterness with a very clean finish. Feeling watery, clean, softly carbonated. Delightful in every way.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","bmerz"
3340,"2015-06-14",4.3,"Bottle from Meditrina. Hazy golden pale orange with lasting head and lace. Fresh orangy spicy peppery doughy aroma. Mild tropical fruit pineapple sweetness with medium assertive citrus and peppery bitterness and very clean dry finish. Light and lively body. Whats not to like. Excellent.","Springfield, Vermont, USA","malrubius"
3340,"2015-06-13",3.9,"Bottled on 05/29/15.
This was poured into a nonic pint glass.
The appearance was a ruddy to hazy yellow color with light streams of carbonation seen rising at a moderate pace. About a two finger white foamy head dissipates within less than about forty seconds leaving a light lingering semi-sliding lacing.
The smell starts off with a sharp mango, orange and grapefruit leading into a sweet refreshing crisp grassiness.
The taste combines and revolves around the citrus and tropical notes to sweeten and make crisp. Theres no aftertaste but it does have a quick tropical to citrus finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Carbonated nicely as an AIPA, the harshness from the bitterness is there but refined nicely.
Overall, Maine Beer Company did an excellent job of making a session AIPA. Definitely one to have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
3340,"2015-06-06",3.8,"500 ml bottle purchased at 7-11, Kittery. With a bottle date of 5-29-15. Color has a haze with a bright yellow hue. Aroma is grapefruits, mango, and a moderate level of fresh cut grass. 
The base has light grain with a good level of fruit and grass. The bitterness is on the mild side and more grassy then fruity. Mouthfeel is juicy with grapefruits and orange pith. Honestly it reminds me of a scaled back Dinner. If you can; grab this soon otherwise I feel like the greatness of this session will fade very quickly. On the higher end for a session IPA.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

3340,"2015-06-05",3.6,"Pours a hazy medium golden color with two ginger of white foam. Nose is beautiful array of nectarine, tangerine, candied orange, mango, juicy hop smackin goodness ! Palate follows but is more restrained and tighter than the juiciness on the nose. Simple backend grain bill, stale grass, some citrus but more in the herbal grassy flavors Wish the dry hopped aroma profile came across more in the flavor. Still easy to drink and tasty but damn that nose had me thinking this was gonna be next level.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
