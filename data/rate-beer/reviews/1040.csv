1040,"2017-03-21",3.4,"22 oz. bottle, consumed on 2-12-17. Bottled on 03/22/13, so it has had nearly four years of aging. 2013 Classic Release. Scents of clay, milk chocolate, and chocolate-covered raisin. Also dried apricot, peanut dust, and malted milk balls. Good smell, but Ive smelled much better, especially within the style. A lot is going on in the aroma, and it has a fair amount of complexity, but its not outstanding beyond that. Pours a rich, dark brown with a small to moderate amount of sable head. Nice appearance, although not outstanding for the style. The head is short-lasting, unfortunately. Dry, bitter, tarry flavor reminds me of burnt bread crust. The flavor, to the beers benefit, is much more bitter than the sweet-leaning aroma suggests. Coffee with some spice (cinnamon and chili pepper). Mulled apple cider. Medium body, on the light side for the style. Decent liveliness. Forgettable and nondescript palate effects. Im surprised I havent rated this beer previously.

1040,"2016-12-02",3.9,"Valahogy sejteni lehetett, hogy a Stone Imperial Russian Stout-ja esetében nem feltétlenül valami behemót kőolajszörny testet öltésére kell számítani, bár a kitöltés során igen selymes, sikamlós módon érkezik a pohárba, a túlzott habképződés pedig tovább kuszálja a szálakat. Érdemesnek tűnik átlépni azon a néhány percen, amíg az ital eléri az üzemi hőfokot, a kezdeti jegyei ugyanis imperial stout-hoz mérten kissé esetlennek tűnnek, a típusbeli besorolás vonatkozásában mindenesetre egyértelmű iránymutatással nem szolgálnak. Éppoly élesztős, mint amennyire black ipás a karakter, a szerkezet viszont tagadhatatlanul sima és bársonyos, már az első percekben is. Némi édesgyökér, medvecukor, mandula aromája rajzolódik ki rögtön, s válik egyre teltebbé, mint ahogyan a kortyok is mindinkább tartalmasabbak lesznek az idő múlásával, mégis azt érezzük, hogy kissé éretlen, túlzottan is fiatalos az ital, mindamellett, hogy a keretek adottak a karakter elmélyüléséhez. Már csak azért is, mert a szerkezet tökéletes terepet biztosítana ehhez, a marcipános, rumos meggyes, pörkölt ízjegyek szinte szétolvadnak az italban. A 2016-os imperial stout személyében egy remek sörrről van szó, a rejtett tartalékok kibontakozása tehetné valóban első osztályú főzetté, amely azonban csak a fogyasztó türelmén múlik.","HUNGARY","adster"

1040,"2016-11-21",3.8,"Imperial Russian Stout 2016 Release  
 Alkohol:  10,8% obj. 
 Data butelkowania:  03.03.2016 
 Kolor: Czarny, nieprzejrzysty. 
 Piana:  Średniej klasy, umiarkowanie trwała, drobnopęcherzykowata o beżowym kolorze.
Początkowo całkiem nieźle sobie radziła, lecz po paru chwilach opadła do półcentymetrowego krążka.
Lacing raczej średniej kategorii.
Nic szczególnego. Jeden czy dwa krążki. 
 Zapach:  Aromat jest bardzo ładny i głęboki.
Pierwsze skojarzenia zapachowe to: anyż i odrobina lukrecji.
Sporo słodyczy karmelowej, cukier trzcinowy i miód.
Kolejno dołączają do bukietu mleczna czekolada, pralinki z owocowym nadzieniem i odrobina kandyzowanych owoców.
Niebywała jest też waniliowa nutka w oddali.
Piwo nie było leżakowane w żadnej beczce, a pomimo tego czuć wyraźnie wanilię.
Dla mnie bomba! 
Już mi ślinka cieknie;) 
 Smak:  W smaku bardzo bogate, złożone, wielowarstwowe.
Pierwsze łyki orbirują wokół ciemnych i czerwonych owoców (czarna porzeczka, jeżyna, wiśnie, lekka śliweczka).
Kolejne hausty dostarczają na podniebienie akcentów anyżu, lukrecji, lekkiej wanilii.
Na ostatniej prostej do przełyku pojawia się mnóstwo czekoladowych pralinek, czekolady deserowej, ciasteczek, delicji, krówek z karmelem w środku.
Kawa jest ostatnią wyczuwalną przeze mnie nutką zapachową.
Nie daję się jednak zwieść tej słodyczy, gdyż sam finisz jest półsłodki, lub nawet półwytrawny.
Goryczka jest wypadkową sił ciemnych owoców, kawy, lekkiego rozgrzewającego alkoholu. 
Po paru łykach czuć delikatne ściąganie na języku.
Piwo ma gęstą, zbitą teksturę, gładkie odczucie w ustach.
O alkoholu wspomniałem już powyżej. Rozgrzewa w żołądku, ale nie dominuje.
Wysycenie ciut za wysokie.
Całościowo trunek świetny, ale nie wybitny. 
 Wysycenie:  Średnie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Imperial Russian Stout kupiony w USA parę misięcy temu. Odleżakowany ponad pół roku.
Z pewnością lepszy od tego samego piwa z Stone Berlin.

To jest taki RIS dla każdego. Klasyczny, świetnie wyważony.
Nie ma żadnych dodatków i nie był leżakowany w żadnej beczce.
Imperial Stout, który stoi gdzieś pośrodku wytrawnego RIS-a, a tego słodkiego, pełnego.
Dzięki tej zależności udaje mu się połączyć serca obu grup zwolenników.
Na uwagę, poza standardowymi zapachowo-smakowymi sugestiami zasługują nuty anyżu, krówek z karmelem i delikatnej wanilii.
Ukrycie alkoholu i faktura piwa mieszczą się w dopuszczalnych normach.
Mankamentami są zbyt wysokie wysycenie i trochę za ostra, zbyt ściągająca goryczka.
Wypicie w pojedynkę 0,66l było sporym ""funem"", ale cóż zrobić w końcu to mój Miesiąc RIS-ów.
Poza tym trunek warty skosztowania dla fanów klasyków.

1040,"2016-09-10",4.3,"One of the great classics in the American craft beer revolution, finally got my hands on a bomber, from the 2016 edition at 10.8% ABV (so not the 10.5% mentioned here and with slightly different label). Thick and very regular, lightly lacing, deep tan coloured, creamy head resting on top of an ink black beer only revealing its burgundy hue on the edges and under bright light. Strong and classic impy aroma of espresso beans, bitter chocolate, mocha ice cream, undisturbing haemoglobin iron as in many Stone beers, burnt cane sugar, black tea, leather, unsmoked pipe tobacco, parsley, Haagse hopjes, moldy walnuts, toasted brown bread, gin, nutmeg, toffee, cocoa nibs even though they arent physically there, dried plums, black peppercorns and some faint varnish-like solvents, but only in the very end and embedded into the whole so not bothering me at all. Lovely start: some restrained candied, raisin-like sweetness opens with a thin umami coating and a sourish undercurrent of roasted barley, burnt sugar-like sensations, immediately coating the mouth cavity and with the perfect softish amount of carbonation, prickling just a little bit here and there. Dried fruits and caramelized sugar are effortlessly carried onwards by a wave of smooth, thick, creamy maltiness, deeply and pleasantly nutty at first with toffeeish edges, deeply toasted and gaining more and more fondant- and black coffee-like roasted bitterness towards the end, where it gets the company of peppery hops adding a layer of spicy, long-lasting bitterness to the powerful roasted flavour, followed by a glow of warming, gin- and somewhat whisky-like alcohol. Caramelly malt sweetness lingers along with the roasted bitterness and the hops. Clean, to the point, rich and potent: this is an exemplary imperial stout. More experimental elaborations of the style may have surpassed it meanwhile, this is still very classic, almost English, in its general make-up, but beers like this are apparently indestructible and still act as milestones and style references in an ever shifting craft beer culture. I guess this could be one of many perfect introductions to the imperial stout style, it has the right body, stature, perfect technical execution, balance of style characteristics and historical background for that. I love a good imperial stout like so many other beer geeks do, and this feels like revisiting my first experiences with the style. Lovely, righteously a classic indeed.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

1040,"2016-04-10",3.9,"2013 Classic Release.

10.6%ABV.  Russian Imperial Stout.

Poured out black.  40ºSRM.

Nose is sweet with the syrupy cloy of stewed dark fruit and prunes. Dark chocolate and some coffee.  There is a spicy sweetness to it that is reminiscent of Japanese curry which tends to be sweet.  There is also a sweet medicinal aspect to the nose which is described locally as the palate of Chinese cooling tea, or by the western palate as licorice.

Mouthfeel is soapy and almost syrupy.  Palate is aggressively alcoholic.  There are roasted malt and dark malt flavors of black bread, with an nice oat-y base.   Coffee with espresso at the back of the palate, likely a function of the alcohol.  Hard to tell if there are hops, which may be bitter because of the deeply roasted malt flavors or the alcohol. 

Finish is dry and there is no ume but instead some nice sweet prune, dates and plums in the palate on the finish.  

Overall, a very full bodied brew that showcases the style so very very very well. As the brew warms you start to appreciate more of the abundant grain bill with dark malts, roasted malt and oats which are somewhat left over that the yeast in the bottle didnt convert to alcohol.

Pours black with a medium sized tan head that is thick and well retained. The lacing on the glass is very nice. 

The aroma is sweet, chocolaty, rich and has a nice roasty malt character to it. This one is a 2015 bottle, so not quite a year old yet, but it still shows some signs of leafy and fruity hops on the bouquet. Its defiantly got some dark fruit on the nose and a little bit of alcohol. 

The flavor is a serious interplay of big roastiness (and the bitterness that comes along with that), some leafy hops, a sweet chocolate character, some molasses and a mild but warming alcohol character. Honestly the bitter on sweet balance is a lot more apparent in the flavor of this beer, I expected it to be much sweeter from the aroma.

The aromas follow directly into the taste along with a strong licorice/anise flavor. The overall body and flavor seem relatively light for such a big beer, but thats most likely the product of a very well balanced approach to this. This is true when its at the proper serving temperature, but its much harsher when its a bit too cold (you gotta experiment a bit with something like this, right?).

Smells mostly of dark cocoa and esspresso, some roasted maltiness, vanilla, dark fruits, and a certain grape like characteristic. Its fresh so its still got that bite to it, but theres a sweetness that comes through and in addition to the coffee and chocolate theres some currant or raisins present and a certain wine or grape juice like flavor that I cant quite put my finger on

There's a light roast, and the complexity is absolutely beautiful. The flavor is lighter, but too balanced. There seems to be a lot of dominance on the roast, and that's what lingers. I like the initial licorice bitterness, but then it seems Torah together too well to have nicely discerning flavors of the dark fruits and sweet molasses that the aroma offered.

This was poured into a pint glass and a snifter.
The appearance had a nice dark brown close to a black color with a one finger white to off white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. The lacing was there as it speckled the glass adequately.
The smell had a super nice blend of roasted chocolate tones to a slight coffee beans with light vanilla and anise.
The taste was very nice as it allowed a super nice sweet and roastiness to invade the tastebuds in a slight boozy pummeling of sorts.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with more of sipping aspect assigned to this brew. The carbonation finishes roasty and smooth.

1040,"2014-06-15",4.5,"Transfer from BA review on 5-15-12 - 
Poured from bottle into snifter

Appearance  Pours a pitch black color with a two finger brown head. The head has great persistence and eventually fades to give some decent lacing.

Smell  A heavy sweet chocolate aroma and malty brown bread mixed with good hints of vanilla, coffee and caramel are mixed within. There is a very light boozy aroma that rounds out the sweeter and maltier aromas well, creating an overall great smell experience.

Taste  The taste begins with a huge sweeter cocoa/ semi-sweet chocolate flavor with a nice strong dark breadiness. The sweetness given to the cocoa is of vanilla and the light caramel that was in the nose. As the taste moves on, the dark breadiness remains as a base for the beer along with the cocoa flavor. While the cocoa is ever present, its sweetness profile changes throughout. It begins sweet and then bitters more in the middle as some roasty flavors enter the taste. As the cocoa bitters in the middle, it is joined with a coffee flavor accentuating/enhancing the bitterness. This bitter however is soon again lessened as sweetness comes back to the tongue. At the very end, the alcohol that was detected in the nose comes to fruition and takes the taste to the end. While the taste in the mouth finishes leaves sweeter, the aftertaste turns more bitter. Overall its fantastic.

Mouthfeel Thick, chewy and creamy. The body is absolutely awesome. The carbonation level however is a bit too high and pulls away from the wonderful creaminess and prevents the tastes from soaking into the tongue. While the carbonation isnt superb, overall the amazing body makes for a great mouthfeel.

Overall  A very tasty and slow drinking stout. It has a wonderful flavor profile, aroma, appearance and a fantastic body. Very enjoyable.","","Darkmagus82"

I couldnt help but think of a grilled steak that had been marinated in soy sauce and red wine - topped with mushrooms just to bring out that extra umami connection. Its settled.

1040,"2014-01-19",4.4,"This is my kind of imperial stout. Intense, thick and massive, but at the same time balanced and, if not exactly gentle, at least drinkable and more-ish. The aroma is intense and of course heavily malt driven with roasted notes and bitter coffee, but its not overly roasted, and there are also delicious sweet notes of dark caramel and dark chocolate. Almost as strong are fruity notes, dark dried fruits mostly, with prune being the most obvious. In the back there are some alcohol and a touch of black currant. The flavours are very strong and initially dominated by sweet notes of dark caramel and chocolate with dark dried fruits in the back. A light bitterness starts out early and is in the beginning just a modest background to the moderate sweetness and the sweet gentle flavours, but then the bitterness grabs the gentle notes by the balls, smacks them up and hangs them upside down in meat hooks, and in the long-lasting finish the heavy bitterness totally runs the show along with dark roasted coffee and citric hints. The mouthfeel is perfect with the expected full body, oily texture and soft carbonation. In the glass the beer is black with a small, medium brown head that ends up as a partially covering film and some foam sticking to the walls of the glass. Perfection!

1040,"2013-11-06",4.9,"COMMERCIAL DESCRIPTION
""Theres no question that Stone Imperial Stout is revered among enthusiasts,"" states Stone CEO Greg Koch. ""I know, because Im one of em and I can hardly wait for it to come out each year!"" Some may think that a late Spring release for a special brew of this sort is an odd time for it to come out onto the market. Koch justifies this with the rationalization ""What better than a warm time of year to come out with a brew that tastes great as it warms up!"" Thats because ""ice cold"" is certainly not the appropriate way to serve the beer. Nearly without exception, the darker, richer and more alcoholic a brew is, the warmer the serving temperature should be. The Stone Imperial Stout label describes the brew as being ""intensely aromatic (notes of anise, black currants, coffee, roastiness and alcohol) and heavy on the palate...expect this mysterious brew to pour like used motor oil and taste even heavier! Serve at 55 degrees.""","massillon, Ohio, USA","MoorFiend"

1040,"2013-08-04",4.4,"I know that Im a bit late on the review train for this monstrously popular seasonal beer from Stone, but I cant pass up the opportunity to check this stuff out. This beer is released every year in the spring, and, because it is an odd year, it has been simultaneously released with the Stone Espresso Imperial Russian Stout as part of the Odd Beers for Odd Years program. Ill be reviewing that one shortly.

Appearance (5/5)
Stone IRS pours like motor oil from the bottle, pure opaque black with a small dark khaki-colored head. Because of the style, this appearance excites me because just looks like something that is going to be big, bad, and bold. 

Aroma (9/10)
The nose is full of huge medium-to-dark chocolate notes. Seriously, I was amazed at just how big of a chocolate bomb the aroma on this stuff was. That chocolate aroma comes along with some notes of coffee ice cream, molasses, and a touch of dark fruit. Really nice.

Taste (19/20)
While the aroma is full of chocolate, that the taste is a nice combination of medium roast coffee and chocolate. Every sip seems to go back and forth between milk and dark chocolate tastes, and the chocolate notes make way for a nice roasty, coffee aftertaste that lingers nicely for a few minutes. As the stout warms, the volume of those roast notes slowly increases, but never to a point where it dominates the palate.

Drinkability (3/5)
Honestly, the mouthfeel doesnt have the luscious, velvety feeling that the appearance had me expecting. Instead, I get a medium body with a touch of carbonation present. While Im not going to say that it has low drinkability for the style, it doesnt coat my mouth and provide the same experience as some other imperial stouts. (Honestly, though, if this is my biggest complaint, Id say were doing pretty well.)

Intangibles (8/10)
The Stone IRS is a big, tasty beer that looks good in my snifter and has a taste to back up the overall appearance. That said, there isnt anything going on here that I havent had before; this is a great benchmark stout because it represents a great standard by which to judge other great stouts. I just wish there was something about it that pushed the envelope to that transcendent level. This is a must buy for stout lovers, and it should be relatively easy to acquire even now.

This pours black a little bit thick. Its got no light even on the edges and the head is a cocoa brown. Its thin but lasts well. Wet shimmering lace and alcohol legs. Head refreshes on each tip of the glass. Nose is dark, roasted malt thats slightly burnt. Dark roasted coffee that is very intense, espresso, bittersweet chocolate and a brief flash of a bright fruit that was cherry until it faded to a dark fruity quality overall. As it warmsit become sa bit earthy and woody and you begin to notice a hop presence. A little toffee and a nice sugary scent. Tiny bit of char and the toasted malt together with the cherry fruit is quite the start of the nose. The chocolate takes a back seat for now. Theres some alcohol on the nose that creeps in intermittently. Its not always there. Taste follows the nose. Its dark and full with malt. The malt is bitter and theres a hop bitter too. Not too much and it leaves for a dry and warming finish. The chocolate sweetens deeply as this warms and the sugar remains pretty light. The coffee helps to smooth it out. Light molasses and a slight nutty flavor. There is a bit of alcohol on the palate intermittently as well but it remains in check. 

When I rated this the first time I didnt like it as much so I I got myself another bottle. I have to say that this one is fresher than the last and I like it much more. The mouthfeel is creamy and not too oily this time. The fruit stays up and bright this time to lend an all around sweetness and bright flavor to the darker heavier aspects. The nutty flavor intensifies as it warms and suddenly I am begining to change my mind. What kept it from a higher score in taste and smell is that pesky alcohol.

Stone describes this brew as ""intensely aromatic (notes of anise, black currants, coffee, roastiness and alcohol) and heavy on the palate"". This about sums up the semantics. It is heavy and complex without the burnt flavor that some other heavy brews have had. It has a spice and desertiness to it... at times reminds me of buttered rum chocolates, but not so sweet.

Strong caramel mingles with milk chocolate, cream, molasses, bread, cereal, dark fruit, and notes of coffee. Stone IRS taxes the nose with a rich, complex bouquet that is just downright titillating.
The gargoyle does not disappoint! Roasted malts, caramel, toffee, and brown sugar give way to a slightly hoppy, bitter and roasty malt finish thats smoothed out with cream. Dark roasted malts and- maybe even a little smoke- linger long on the palate. The delightfully bitter finish demands that sweet, creamy front. You will find it hard to put this stout down.

1040,"2013-06-17",4.5,"I received a 12oz bottle of a 2008 vintage in a trade with ""Ding"" (thanks, man!). It actually had an ""enjoy by"" date of 1/1/2013. I poured it into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Completely opaque black of the deepest shades. Forms a small, brown, foamy head which mostly dissipates but not completely and leaves minor lacing on the glass.

Smell: An interesting combination of red grape, orange citrus and chocolate syrup.

Taste: If you know me youd probably assume I drink ""Stone IRS"" every year, but I actually havent had this beer in quite a few years. I was definitely excited to try a 5-year-old vintage of it since I do remember it being quite an intense beer when it was fresh. The aging has definitely helped to take the edge off, though the flavors seem a tad muted as well. Its a small price to pay because the net result is still a complex and delicious beer.

A delicious blend of chocolate, black licorice, red grape, some orange fruit and just enough bitterness to balance it out. I do remember a fresh vintage having a slightly sour/tart note, which is barely recognizable this time around. Chocolate syrup is still quite prominent, as is some black licorice or root beer flavors but without any spiciness. Theres some black cherry through the middle along with slightly dank hoppiness coupled with some orange flavor. A beer this beer needs plenty of hops to balance it out and after five years theyve faded a bit as its not exactly a bitter bomb, but still retains enough hop character to maintain the balance as the sweetness never becomes cloying. The alcohol has faded to the background well, though its still noticeable and does tie all the flavors together. This is definitely one of the best examples of the style Ive ever had.

Drinkability: After five years in the cellar, Stone Imperial Russian Stout has mellowed wonderfully. The mouthfeel is soft, smooth and slightly slick but not oily. It goes down remarkably easy and is only slightly dry in the aftertaste. The 10.8% ABV weight is quite efficient as the beer is still overtly strong, but its actual boozy character has mellowed and is easily tolerable. I highly recommend cellaring a bottle since the results are this good.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

T:  The dark coffee again leads, followed by the dark chocolate.  Some caramel sweetness but finishes with a combination of roast and hop bitterness and some alcohol warming. 

M:  Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied with a medium/high carbonation that makes the beer seem lighter than it pours.

1040,"2013-04-24",4.2,"Dark murky with very little head that marbles on the surface. Smells of anise, chocolate, alcohol. Fairly thick, with coffe, chocolate, roast, a wee bit of hop bitter in the finish. A nice subtle sweet throughout with alcohol fairly present with the anise. The roasted coffee is most apparent about mid to late taste. Perhaps a little smokiness in there too. Pretty complex overall and very impressive.

Toffee, molasses, dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, black licorice, plumb, dark cherry, accents of cola, really all the same characteristics I experienced in the fresh bomber of this vintage with obviously less hop assertiveness, but everything has merged and thickened to hit that level of dessert like wonder I expect in the style; strangely enough, I enjoyed this on the cooler side of 50º, with warmth the stark grassy characteristics and stanch alcohol notes began to take over and remind me of the fresher bottle; I do enjoy a hoppy stout, but the textured, grassy house Stone hop characteristic just doesnt quite work for me in this one; Im excited to see where this batch is headed

Pours jet black with a thick chocolate colored two finger head that disappates quickly and leaves a decent amount of sticky lacing. Aroma is HUGE and mouth-watering! Roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, caramel, raisins, and alcohol. Taste is heavy roasted malts and alcohol up front. The alcohol is not masked behind other flavors and comes through very pronounced. Not that this is a bad thing, and I certainly dont think Stone was attempting to hide it. You know youre drinking a 10.5%er with this one. After letting it warm on the tongue, coffee, chocolate and dark fruit all come through. Long finish of roasty malts and coffee. The full body and chewy, thick and sticky texture should come as no surprise. Carbonation is average, but combined with the alcohol it does sting the mouth and tongue pretty well. Definitely one to cellar for a year or longer, however I wanted one RIGHT NOW and wanted something special for my 100th review. Overall, every bit as amazing as one would expect. Its in the 100th percentile for a reason!  You know when you open this that you should expect the best, and Stone delivers!

1040,"2012-08-25",3.9,"Poured into a Williamsburg Winery wine glass.

A: Pours a damn near pitch black body with good thickness and viscosity. The head is a two finger light tan color with excellent texture, decent retention, and solid lacing.

S: All the usual RIS notes are here; slight soy, dry bakers chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, leather, and tobacco nicely mingle on the nose. While its a nice melange, its too subdued, much to its detriment.

T: The flavor starts off with some dark fruit notes (raisins, currants, plums) along side some leather and licorice. Afterward, it progresses toward dark chocolate and roast notes, and it finishes salty and slightly boozy. There are hints of tobacco and piny hops throughout the flavor progression. Balance is decent, but not impeccable, as it slightly leans towards fruitiness. On the plus side, it featured the kind of complexity I was expecting from a beer of this caliber.

M: Decently heavy with good viscosity and low carbonation, with a dry finish, almost to the point of causing the mouth to water. The aftertaste lingers nicely with dried dark fruits. Touches of alcohol can be felt on the tongue, throat, and stomach.

O: A tough beer to digest at first - but one that rewards its drinker with good complexity and a breadth of flavor storytelling. It isnt immensely drinkable, but then again, something like this should be savored slowly. Given its price point, its one I can heartily recommend; having said that, it doesnt live up to hype most give it.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Poured into a tulip

A-- Poured jet black, nice looking light brown head that grew to one finger before going to film. Good retention early on. No lacing. 

S-- Big, thick baking chocolate, roasted malts, and coffee. Really took on a nose that seemed to me of oak. Really blended together well and had the nose of a beer than had been on wood. 

T-- Dark chocolate, baking chocolate and coffee. Big in your face taste. Hops had dropped off and the malts had really taken over. 

M-- Big, rich and dry. Very dry baking chocolate and coco powder finish. Had enough carbonation up front to smooth out the chocolate up front. No trace of alcohol at all in the mouth. Just chocolate. Big body and low carbonation

1040,"2012-08-20",3.8,"Creamy, milk chocolate nose when cold. 1 finger light brown head. Dried dark fruit palate, mixed with layers of toasty malt, coffee, caramel and molasses.  Not overly sweet or sticky though.. A subtle rich lingering finish of dried black fruit and coffee grounds remains on the palate.. Surprisingly little coffee and chocolate overtones, and very little bitterness, with a dry finish, with only a tiny touch of sweetness... Still something keeps it from being round and seamless on the palate though.. And the lower carbonation also seems to detract from a more balanced mouthfeel. Reminds me more of barley wine, with a roasted malt character, then a stout... Maybe I am just clueless of how a Imperial Russian Stout should ideally be. Enjoyable, just not what I was expecting.

The alcohol, particularly in the finish, is a bit forward. This is a fresh bottle, brewed Spring 2010. I can definitely see how this beer would greatly benefit from a few years of proper cellaring.

Shockingly smooth (at first). Leaves a nice coating around the palate. Warming alcohol finish, which gets harsher as you progress through the bottle.

Alcohol becomes more and more evident as I continue to sip. This would be a good beer to split, perhaps several ways. I had trouble making it through the bomber by myself.

Notes: I understand that this beer improves with age, but so do a lot of beers. I just dont understand why this beer has such a high rating. There was never a moment when I was really moved by the taste of Stone IRS.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

The result is a very enjoyable IRS that you can drink easily, but isnt overly filling or rich, yet still maintaining enough complexity and character to keep me interested. Pours thick and dark with a heavy rocky medium brown head. Overall aroma is very light, especially for a Stone beer. Chocolate and caramel scents with a hint of something like butterscotch and slight herbal hops. Flavor is mostly sweet, with a touch of sour and bitterness, and somewhat savory. The appearance suggests an overly-heavy bodied beer, but this is misleading, as the body is heavy enough to carry the flavors without being too thick and hard to swallow. Creamy and silky texture with soft carbonation that smooths out the bite from the high alcohol content very nicely without overshadowing the flavor.

Thick, viscous, and mouth coating.  Licorice and alcohol on the aftertaste.  The age has clearly been kind to this beer, but at the same time it hasnt had barrel time like most of the competitors in its class have.  Not quite the complexity of a barrel aged RIS, but remarkable for its age nonetheless.  Then again, those beers easily cost twice as much, when you can find them.  Not quite as good as Abyss, for example, but not far back and given the easy availability and reasonable price this is easily the best beer you can find daily in the grocery store.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"
1040,"2012-05-09",4.0,"A: This Stone offering pours like a typical Russian imperial stout. Black, rather thick and not much carbonation to speak of. It produced a real nice one and a half size chocolate milk colored head that dissipates quickly and leaves some nice lacing behind.

S: First off roasted chocolate with some smoke or charred scents followed by Roasted malts and some caramel sweetness and coffee. I also do pick up on the alcohol on this one.

T: I dont know what I was expecting but wow is this one complex in the taste. I get tons of chocolate, coffee, caramel and a toasted/roasted malt. This is a sweet, decadent chocolate covered espresso bean tasting stout. On the tail end the hop bite takes hold to balance out the sweetness just right. Well balanced between sweet and the bitterness from the hops.

M: I thought after pouring this bad boy it was going to be on the thin side but Id say it is instead moderate. Not chewy but this does coat my mouth with a slickness that is rather enjoyable. The taste sticks around for a long, long time and is still evident as I reach for the next sip. Not much carbonation but rather just enough as the balance creates a wonderful silky mouthfeel. 

O: I heard mostly good things about this offering but also some mediocre thoughts as well. I agree with the good things on this one. It was a pleasant surprise and I am really enjoying this. I love bourbon barell aged stouts but this too has its place. So glad I was able to pick up a few of these as I am eager to see how this matures.

1040,"2012-03-01",4.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 1/12/2011.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip. 2010 release.

IRS is an extremely dark mahogany color, nearly black. I can work to tilt the glass and create a walnut edge, but for all intents and purposes, nothing will get through. A foamy, very dark brown head exists at first, slowly and menacingly fading to a thin ring. Spotty lace exists on the glass.

Burnt roasted malts, roast coffee, dark chocolate, molasses, and vanilla create a great, strong aroma. A faint hint of alcohol in the background.

The best part about this beer is how well the flavors come together. Heavily roasted malt and coffee blend together well to start. This is everything I want in a dark RIS and it is delicious. A touch of dark chocolate and vanilla, followed by a warming alcohol presence before some light earthy hops carry it home. A lingering coffee bitterness is the only thing I would like cleaned up a bit.

This is not syrupy, a tough feat for a viscious stout. There is enough carbonation to keep it out of that range. Obviously full bodied, with medium carbonation. A bit sticky, and alcohol warms the stomach.

Stone IRS is ultimately smooth, and the flavors blend really well together. The only issue is really the strong coffee aftertaste. I will definitely look out for this every Spring.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

At first sip it is nice and balanced, but presents itself much more powerfully with each additional sip.  The malt is also very sweet in the aftertaste, with is not quite in balance.  That sweetness and alcoholic warmth is silky smooth upfront, but in the aftertaste leaves your mouth dry.  It also goes to your head a little bit letting me think it might have been fermented a tad warms - perhaps on purpose - and thus the fruity notes.

Pours a 1/2 inch milk chocolate head. Body is black with very dark brown highlights.  Head retention and lacing are slightly above average

Smell is of sweet caramel malts, smoke, and lightly roasted coffee. There is also very slight diacetyl/buttery aromas in there. Hops arent detected and alcohol is very light.

Taste is of burnt malt, slight soy sauce, smoky peat, and some bitter chocolate. Hops arent very present and alcohol is lightly tasted leaving a warming sensation down the throat

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation. Head wasnt present throughout the beer and therefore didnt contribute much. 

Overall beer was good but very different from when it was fresh. Alcohol and hops have diminished but so has the sweet chocolate that was present when it was acouple months old.

1040,"2011-12-02",4.3,"Poured from a bottle, it spilled into my glass black with a slight tan hew ... almost looking like slightly burned motor oil. A small, dark tan head formed up to about a half inch in height, dissipating within a minute or two.  The aroma is immediately of chocolate and coffee.  And I sense something else ... berry, raisin?  Im not sure.  I wish I had a snifter handy to help cuz I may rank it higher. 

Finally, the taste.  Its so smooth, with all the flavors rolling across my tongue and showing themselves one at a time, each taking their turn without conflict.  The brewer states anise, but Ive not been able to detect it in the aroma or the flavor.  Pleasantly bitter, but not overly so.  The head, which has long been reduced to a thin, tan ring, lightly laces the glass.  And while that lacing initially didnt last, as the brew warms it seems to be sticking more.  The body is full, but on the light to medium side of full.  And Id say its between slick and thick.  I love the way is slides off my tongue.  These are traits that would probably make this a Russian Imperial Stout thats more palatable to those who dont normally seek this style out.  

As Im sipping my way through this brew I find myself being more and more satisfied, and yet almost dreading the fact that it wont last beyond this glass that sets before me.  Perhaps thats the alcohol speaking to me?  Could be.  Its 10.5%, and yet its presence is hidden from its taste and aroma.  55 degrees F is the recommended serving temp, and I completely agree.

1040,"2011-11-28",4.1,"650 ml bottle. 2011 release.  Pours a dark black with a small tan chocolate head that has decent retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass.  The aroma is roasty with dark, bitter chocolate.  It has a bit of a floral hop presence as well.  A bit of alcohol as well.  The initial taste has some bitter chocolate, then comes a bit of coffee roastiness and a bit of hops.  There is also some dark fruits, plum, and a hint of cherry.  The finish has a decent bitterness to it and a hint of alcohol, but not nearly as much as in the nose.  Medium bodied with a bit of creaminess.  Low-medium carbonation.  Great beer, especially when you consider the price.","Berkeley, California, USA","jethrodium"
1040,"2011-11-24",4.9,"Poured from a bomber into a snifter

Appearance: rich blackish/brown with amber highlights. Tan, half finger head that recedes rather quickly. Good lacing.

Smell: chocolate with anise. Coffee also enters the picture.

Taste: Wow! Rich. Expresso and chocolate rock the palate. Licorice slides in. Smooth finish. This is what IRSs are all about.

Mouthfeel: medium, almost chewy. Carbonation really lingers on the tongue.

Overall: A royal, omnipotent sipping stout. Even better as it warms. Would happily buy again. Stone IRS and Old Raspy are the best two IRSs Ive tried.","Burbank, USA","Aux84"

A - Pours jet black with a small half finger tall tan head, dissipating down to almost nothing, leaving very little lacing down the glass.
S - Lots of dark roast, bittersweet chocolate, dark roasted coffee, and some vanilla sweetness. Not as sweet and roasty as some of the others, more of a balanced nose.
T - Rich coffee, chocolate, and lots of dark roast mix well to form a well rounded stout. Finish is roasty, but not to the point of being overpowering, and it lingers for a good amount of time. Easily one of the best beers on the market today. I am glad I have a few of these in the cellar.

This brew poured up a black colored body with a billowy tan-colored head that dissipated rather quickly but left moderate lacing. Aromas of roasted coffee beans, dark fruits, burnt sugar, and sweet malts. The body is rich and thick and loaded with sweet malts.  Moderate on the carbonation with flavors of coffee, dark fruits, brown sugar, dark chocolate. This brew continues to improve on flavors the more it warms up. Generally with stouts I will take it out of the refrigerator and open; then let sit for 45 minutes to an hour so that it can breathe and warm up; the flavors and scents just abound when you enjoy it this way!

Big big beer.  Pours a ruby red/black colour with a liqourice, chocolate, malt aroma.  Tastes very sweet of malts and slight chocolate malts, liqourice is a resounding note picked up by both the nose and tongue.  Palate is somewhat pour(haha), being almost oily and not carbonated enough to be refreshing yet still tasty enough to drink. This is a very, very(did I say very?) complex beer with numerous notes, each sip tasting different than the last.

It is definitely thick--somewhat reminiscent of chocolate syrup, between the palate and the flavor. But the bitterness actually dampens the palate effect a bit. Finish is dark chocolate bitter--in the 100% cacao sense. Alcohol shows a bit at times, but mostly masked well. Long finish has a touch of earth/dirt.

1040,"2011-07-10",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 6, 2012 Pitch-black beer with an off-tan, really thin head that dissipates quickly. Delicious aroma of roasted malts, cocoa, blackcurrants, anise, caramel, molasses, and some hops (surprisingly restrained for Stone). The fresh bottle didnt conceal the presence of the alcohol (10.5%) very well, but more mature ones smoothed over it beautifully. The taste is bitter and sweet, with just the right amount of hoppiness and fruitiness. Even the ethanoliness level seems to compliment, not spoil, the beer, which is both amazing and unique for such a huge beer. To me, however, the single most outstanding feature of this beer is its mouthfeel. Other stouts are thicker, others are thinner, CO2ier, stickier, syrupier, or motor-oilier. This doesnt fall into any of those categoriesit starts a bit thin at the tip of the tongue but then gains some viscosity as it goes through the mouth and its oh, so very creamy. As it enters the throat it nearly feels like whipped cream, with an almost foamy feel to it. Its simply the best mouthfeel Ive had. The taste is a concoction of gentle, delicious roast; decadent fudge; plums and raisins; anise; and alcohol. The aftertaste has some roast and also anise. This is a really classy brew.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

Pours a rich black with a quarter inch thick, brown head. Pretty heavy lacing around the snifter that sticks around for a while. Aroma is of roasted chocolate malts, coffee, anise, and dark fruit. Flavor is a very intense chocolatey, roasty combination with a huge malt backbone! Underlying flavors of coffee, chewy caramel, black licorice, and anise. Very well balanced with all its complex flavors. Overall palate is pretty heavy, like they describe in the commercial description. Very much like drinking motor-oil, or so I would imagine! Very oily with soft carbonation and a smooth, chocolatey finish. Ive gotta say, Im pretty impressed with this beer! Its definitely right up there with Abyss, but Im not sure Id say it was better. They both have similar qualities, and they both have different qualities that make them stand out among other RISs.

Appearance: This is exactly what you want to see in an Imperial Stout. It has a very dark black body that blocks out all light. Floating on top is two fingers of thick tan head. This head has good retention and makes lots of lacing on the glass.

Smell: The aroma is boozy with a strong malt presence with notes of burnt toast, roasted grain, coffee and dark chocolate.

Taste/Palate: This full bodied beer has a big roasted toasted malty character with the mellow warmth of the alcohol reminding you to sip slowly and just enjoy. Foremost on the tongue are the bitter black chocolate, dark roasted grains and burnt coffee notes with some dark caramel and light molasses sweetness underneath. The mellow boozy abv creeps in and warms all the way to the finish. Its palate is heavy and viscose with just enough carbonation to keep things from getting sticky.

1040,"2010-12-29",4.1,"Notes from 07/2009. 2009 vintage, making this around 4 months old (I think its better at about a year and a half). 

Almost impenetrably black. (Minor burnt umber edge if eclipsing the bedroom fan light.) A cocoa-fallow head moves smoothly about the glass before settling into bubbles atop the abyss. Perfect.

Wow. The nose is comprised of fudge, coffee bean, molasses, and anise. Toasted dark malts abound; a faint roastiness underlies, with suggestions of a spicy bite from the alcohol and hops. 
Taste - thank God - follows suit in elephantine fashion. Huge mouth-immersing maltiness that lingers on the front of the tongue. Licorice, anise, and molasses coat the palate. And the drying chocolate and coffee flavors finally give way to the spiciness of the hops. This one warms the throat.

Covers the mouth. Silky. Not perfectly thick, no, but it fills ones mouth if given the chance and doesnt leave. 

As one who can be seduced by the style, this beer sings. Though lubricious, it demands monogamy. I wouldnt drink anything after this and Id have a hard time sharing, but its still a beer that can do some damage. Tread lightly.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"

As I look closer at the outer edges of the glass, I can see that this stout takes on some burgundy tones.  Thick, thick, thick mouthfeel (though not quite a syrupy as Dark Lord).  Strong coffee notes (which I expect) with a slight sweetness left on the lips.  I am impressed by the smoothness (if you like bold coffee flavors, that is, and I do).  As expected, the character develops as it warms, bringing out aromas of molasses, alcohol, and dried fruit.  I was moved enough by this experience that I took a trip to my pantry to match the aromas I was picking up. I did not pick up hints of anise, though my senses might not be as refined as I would like them to be.

Overall: This is my favorite style of beer, with Old Rasputin (OR) being the gold standard. In fact, these two beers taste almost identical. Stone Imperial Russian Stout (IRS) is a bit higher in alcohol content. Additionally, I think IRS either has a tad more bitterness than OR, a tad less malt, or a combination of both. Together, I find that the higher alcohol content and the higher bitterness-to-malt ratio of IRS causes me to give a slight edge, and therefore the decision victory, to OR. Although the alcohol in both of these beers hits you very fast, I have found that the extra alcohol of IRS hits you that much faster and harder than OR! Of course, Im splitting hairs to make these distinctions. In reality, either beer gets the job done equally well if you like this style.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","keokani"

This is an excellent RIS that everyone should have at least once.  I will certainly have this again.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

1040,"2010-06-22",5.0,"Wow -- this is one of the best-assembled Imperial Russian Stouts Ive ever had.

Stone throws their signature hops into this -- at first, the idea sounds dubious, but the result is more than pleasant.

Make sure you read the back label.  Its hilarious and reflects the great sense of humor that the Stone guys have.  But it also gives some insight as to how and why they did what they did to this stout.

This stout is all about coffee.  It pours looking like a faintly-ruby red motor oil, with a nice tan cafe-au-lait head.  

The aroma is again coffee, with a bit of dark chocolate, floral hops and citrusy fruit.  Its a quite-pleasing smell.

Once it hits your tastebuds, the real fun begins.  Not surprisingly, coffee jumps at you, but the chocolate and roasted malt follow on quickly.  It is mildly-heavy, but less so than other Russian Stouts.  You wont want to drink more than 2 or 3 of these.  

It finishes well, the carbonation being replaced by a velvety smoothness, and leaving a great aftertaste.

Pours an ultra-dark, opaque brown color with an initially thick, foamy brown head that dissipates into a small but resilient cap on the beer.  Aroma of roasted malts, coffee, anise, black currants, dark chocolate, molasses, and earth.  Some smoke is more apparent as it warms.  Flavor of roasted malts, coffee, molasses, leather, dark chocolate, bitter earthy hops, anise, black currants, dark fruits, and alcohol.  Also gets smoky and woody as it warms.  Roasy finish.  Full-bodied, with average carbonation and a rich, roasty mouthfeel.  Good impy stout, but expectations were a bit higher- the roast and booze seems to overwhelm the other notes, particularly as it warms, when the other notes should be emerging more.  RE-RATE, 9/21/10: 2005 vintage, courtesy of sloth- thanks again!  This one is seeing some oxidation set in, but not overwhelmingly so.  Then again, Im not super sensitive to that.  Tons of dark fruits are on display here, along with molasses and cocoa syrup; very chocolaty.  Full-bodied, with virtually no carbonation and an oily, slick mouthfeel.

Ive enjoyed / adored so many Imperial stouts that I give none a free pass.  This is not as good as I remember; that being said, this is still a great blend of malt and hops.  Perhaps my taste have changed, but this is a bit dry and not as well balanced as a top-tier blend.  Roasted, dry, and smooth, but I will not give a former favorite a rating in the 4 range on reputation alone.  Re-Rated 2011 Ahhh...much better!  More like I remember before 2010.

The dark chocolate intensifies for the finish and becomes slightly bitter as a big toasted malt character emerges. What lingers on the palate are hints of bitter dark chocolate, toasted malt, and toffee-all wrapped in a soft alcohol blanket.

P- Medium carbonation with a heavy and rich body with a slight alcohol slickness. The body is not to thick-which increases drinkability immensely.

O- This is one great RIS. Stone produces some awesome dark beers. I was really impressed by this one as well as the smoked porter. This one is very rich-but not too rich and it is my favorite RIS so far. I will definitely purchase this one again. This beer is definitely worth the hype.

1040,"2010-04-16",4.5,"Limited Spring 2008 Release 12oz bottle. A thick, smooth Imperial Stout with phenomenal depth of flavor and a round, luscious mouthfeel. The liquid is opaque and black topped by a small but sticky dark brown head. The nose is rich with perfectly toasted malt.  The malt is mostly chocolate with some coffee on top of wonderfully burnt toast. Theres still some hop bitterness without too much age on the bottle. There are a number of flavors that will take me a few more years of beer tasting to describe adequately.

Vinous / sherry-like, roasty aroma with vanilla, coffee, and some peanuts. Opaque, almost oily black with a light brown ring that dots the glass walls. The flavour is grainy and pumpernickely-sort of reminiscent of a strong European lager, but with a nice, bitter chocolate overtone. The roasted barley bitterness holds on, but leads into a sweet, hazlenut vanilla finish. Full body, moderate carbonation.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"

The beer pours dark brown to black with a khaki colored head. The aroma is chocolate and roasted malt with some piney hops. The flavor is lots of bitter chocolate, coffee and some piney hops as well as roasted malt. As the beer gets to room temperature you start to get some other flavors including semi-sweet chocolate, caramel, toffee and brown sugar. Medium bitterness overall, much less so than when the beer is fresh. The alcohol is not that present in the taste but it is warming.

1040,"2010-03-29",4.7,"Spring 2009 bottle. Wow. I was not expecting this to be such a tremendous beer. I have enjoyed other Stone beers (the Bastard and Double Bastard) but this was a face-punch out of nowhere. Pouring this monster stout delivers one of the most appealing, gorgeous heads youll see. It looks like chocolate ice cream, or the top of a coke float. It just BEGS to be consumed. Thankfully, the taste matches the appearance! Coffee, chocolate, soy, honey, caramel, alcohol, you name it. You get it all in one monster package. I thoroughly loved this beer and will definitely try buy a case to see how it ages.

1040,"2010-03-29",4.2,"2008 Bottle. Nice looking black pour, somewhat viscous out the bottle, with the perfect amount of airy tan head. Aroma has a strong soy sauce component that blends with chocolate and fig. I also got hints of bbq sauce immediately after pours and hints of chocolate milk as I was tilting the glass to sip. Flavor profile had more mellow notes of soy sauce and included lots of roasted malt and cocoa. Also some licorice and vanilla. Medium body but a very slick and creamy mouthfeel. Strong hops and roasted malt in the finish for a nice smoky bitter lingering. An outstanding RIS.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","italarican"
1040,"2010-03-29",4.8,"Night settles unto my glass thick and heavy. There is no moon tonight; the only glimmer of light and life is of an espresso crema head burbling above the blackest midnight. A luscious web-work of espresso lace graces the sides of my glass while from her nose sings a sirens song. Black, rich, and of the finest pedigree, chocolate oozes out of every orifice imaginable. Bakers, pure cacao, Swiss chocolate, truffle dust, and chocolate covered espresso beans lead into burnt wood, ash, and char. Burnt never smelled so good. Cinnamon sticks, vanilla root, burnt sugars, and toasted marshmallows are the perfect complement to an altogether dry yet somehow creamy nose. Vanilla speckled cream draws me in for the first of many sumptuous quaffs. As promised, she is smooth, creamy, and decadently rich in chocolate, espresso, cinnamon, vanilla cream and burnt delights. All moisture vacates my palate, making room for every imaginable flavor and texture to blossom unhindered. Sweet and burnt, marshmallows catch fire; leaving a crunchy burnt sugar crisp all along the outside while inside is an ooey-gooey delight of cream, vanilla, and fluff. Bakers chocolate, pure black cacao, Swiss, and truffle delights oozing caramel nougat into the chocoholics cauldron of sensual delights. Cinnamon and chocolate powder dust the middle and back of her palate. Her burnt essence gently permeates, allowing all other aspects to take center stage. With each quaff, she warms just a little and with each quaff she perfectly seduces. This is one Imperial Russian Stout destined for greatness in a snifter, and my belly.


I have a bottle of the 2008 Stone Russian Imperial Stout aging for future quaffing bliss. The first time I supped on her perfectly roasted depths, the skies opened, angels sang, and harps rang in the background. The second time I supped on her perfectly roasted depths, beervana descended once more. Truly a worthy tribute to her lofty, if not a bit embellished, past. Catherine the Great would be proud.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Black with a small brown and thick head, Nice lacings. A really good looking beer.

A very balanced and round smell, yet with plenty of bold aromas. Hard roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits and coffee - all listed in order of strength. Some alcohol in the nose.

The taste is really good, smooth and powerful at the same time. Its similar to the smell with lots of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and vanilla. Wonderful subtle fruity notes. The finish is quite bitter with a faint hop note, wood and a hint of licorice. The alcohol provides a warming feeling in the finish. It develops nicely in the glass - the roasted character and the fruity notes gain strength as the chocolate takes a step back.

Not overly full-bodied. Smooth mouthfeel and mellow carbonation.

Lovely beer. A year in the cellar was really good for this one.

Appears to be black, but you get a nice ring of dark brown at the surface when held to a light source. One-finger head of milk chocolate brown colored foam. Dissipates rapidly. Nice foamy lacing that slides down the sides of the glass, eager to be back in the dark.

Big malt notes with a touch of booziness. Chocolate, both dark and milk. Black cherries. Vanilla. Toasted barley notes. A touch of brown sugar.

Big taste of dark chocolate with notes of coffee. Brown sugar sweetness with dark molasses. Toasted wheat bread with burnt caramel. Slight hints of dark fruit. Mild alcohol presence.

Good solid medium body. Not as thick as I was expecting, from reputation or from the look of it. Its pretty smooth, though.

Very tasty and easy to drink. This 12oz bottle is nice, but I think Id like the bomber size better. It goes down smooth.

Killer head, the head evens to the end of the glass and builds up. Really cool. I like this. It is also a thick creamy head although there is not much to it. 

Taste is hoppy, malty, yeasty in abundance. Like someone put 300% the normal allocation lots. The taste is smooth; creamy, chocolatey almost like chocolate brownie. There are German black liquerish notes too. The real liquerish if you ask me. The hard style. I can also sense caramel and marzepan. A fantastic beer. Awesome for the winter and one to age. 

Colour pour is black thick oozing tar. This is a fantastic premium beer. The warmth you get after every sip is second to none. An old English ale style warmth so heads up for managing that. Im trying to descirbe this but it is a powerful beverage. Alcohol is 10.5%abv but I feel I could drink a few of these. I can never thank the Rake people enough for providing me with Stone.

Sweet licorice and chocolate flavour with lots of roasted malt and a hint of smoke. There is hoppy bitterness and a certain hop character, though hiding behind a lot of roasted character. Quite sweet, in fact, after the third sip, it feels a bit cloying.","Odense, DENMARK","Christian"
1040,"2009-09-29",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 1, 2009 22 oz bomber from my local beer store. I believe my anticipation to try this one was palpable, needless to say I wasnt up for sharing the bottle. Stones IRS pours an obsidian black with a plentiful brown head which drops quickly and leaves great lace as I drink it down. The aroma is a complex mix of cocoa, roast coffee, and anise. The flavor comes to life as the beer warms. Tastes of dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and raisins. The full body is lush and silky in my mouth. The alcohol is well hidden up front; comes late in the flavor with a bit of hops to bring it home.","Jersey Shore, New Jersey, USA","Bonster"

This fine specimen pours motor oil black with a creamy brown head. Immediately, smells of chocolate, dark fruits, and roasted coffee, like magic, seem to appear out of nowhere. Really, does it get any better than this? I dont think so. Wow! What a mouthfeel! The flavor of roasted malts and chocolate hit you like theres no tomorrow. You know your drinking something special when all the flavors are able to mask the 10.5% ABV like its not even there! 

For a beer thats relatively inexpensive, and is always available, I wonder why I seek out other stouts? Do I see myself looking for something better, something to put this over-the-top? The fact of the matter is, Im looking for something that just so happens to be right in front of my face. Highly recommended! ~","Long Island, New York, USA","goldfish19"

Nose is very dark chocolatey with some nougat sweetness, almost like whoppers candy. But still, very dark cocoa/chocolateness that dominates.

On the palate is one of the most chocolatey beers Ive ever had. Whereas Youngs Double Chocolate is close to Hersheys Milk Chocolate, the Stone Imperial Stout is close to a bar of Godiva Dark Chocolate. Wow. Huge.

Maltiness is amazing. A pleasant roasted taste is there too, some hops in the balance, but Im mesmerized by the chocolate.

Finish goes on for quite some time. The chocolate just lingers. My wife swears that I have a stash of choclate somewhere because of the chocolatiness on my breath!","Glendale, Arizona, USA","yemenmocha"

1040,"2009-09-08",4.6,"Aroma:  Chocolate frosted cake all day with hints of vanilla and coffee. Later, slight vegetal notes briefly appear before being drowned out by persistent chocolate aromas.
Flavor:  Smooth 60% bitter chocolate and milder cocoa,followed by more roasted chocolate and coffee.  Then, add more chocolate.  Finish has mildly bitter chocolate and coffee flavors.
Comment: 2005 bottle aged 3 years and tasted Sept., 2008. Very smooth, lovely full-bodied mouth feel with integrated flavors, mellow chocolate and coffee.  I was afraid that this might have been past its prime, but in fact it may be at its best at 3 years of age.

Based on a friends remark that he had tried vanilla ice cream with stout on it at Pike Place Brewing in Seattle, we put a small dollop into our glasses later on.  The result:  A tasty chocolate and vanilla float with enhanced bitter chocolate and coffee finish.  Though this seems like an intensely shameful thing to do a a beer, I might try it again, maybe even in public.","Kobe, JAPAN","Wombata"

The smell is a strong mocha coffee flavor. Some sweet roasted malt flavor with some kind of creamy chocolate flavor and a small hint of licorice.

The taste is a bit dark chocolate at first. Some slight maple flavor with a great roasty flavor as well. The beer begins to warm you some as each sip with the slight creamy flavor just toward the back end. Like any Stone beer I have had, this beer is full of flavor.

Aroma mainly of mellow roasted malts and biscuits; hints of coffee and dark chocolate are also present.  Flavor of wonderfully roasted malts along with definite tastes of dark coffee and bittersweet chocolate.  The taste is quite reminiscent of dark chocolate-covered espress beans.

Finally drinking this sucker!

2007 vintage

Fn black! Tiny dark brown skim that is mainly only on the rim. The aroma is awesome - so complete and superbly balanced. Sweet, biscuits, mid to dark chocolate, mild over all but very good, maybe blackberries, noticed some hops early on. The flavour is just amazing! Immediately I knew I was drinking one of the best beers Ive ever had. When its warm there is an initial alcohol taste but that just vanishes and is replaced by dark chocolate without the bitterness. I did not think the bitterness of this beer (which is mild) was associated with the chocolate. Dark fake cherry, weak, slight bitterness and almost no coffee and THAT IS GREAT! NO OVERLY STUPID AMOUNT OF COFFEE TO RUIN ANOTHER BEER! Nice fruit and a spice that makes a cameo appearance. The mouth feel is really smooth, minimal alc spice is manageable, very little carbonation, full bodied beer that leave a coating in my mouth that just adds to the experience. Chocolate and mid strength roasted malt finish. This is a truly excellent beer. Thanks, Dove, for smuggling this somewhere inside of your body.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

Pours molasses and espresso brown with root beer barrel candy-colored head; tight and bready.

Balanced and mellow scent has it all - bready yeast, extra-dark roasted maly and slightly bitter hop backbone (earthy and grassy). Just realized that my cold is precluing me from smelling anything mortal so this must be good - may update later.

The balance and mellowness is both surprising and overwhelming. Not too much of anything but enough of everything. Dark espresso with a little licoricle and cinnamon sugar. Some earth, slate, grassy hops and gobs of malt.

Slithers down the throat nicely - with no aftertaste. Thick but clear.

This is thick and skirting that limit of saturation of the palate.  An intense Malt experience with Chocolate, Coffee, BBQ sauce, Burnt Sugars underneath.  Alcohol is more apparent in the aroma.

While there are a few beers that look darker than this, there arent many.  Even holding the beer up to the sunlight, almost no light makes it through.  The aroma is of sweet anise, molasses and fruit.  The flavor has much more coffee and chocolate than I would have expected from the aroma.  Though the beer has a bit of a sweet flavor it is cut nicely by a bitterness around the edges of the mouth.  Unlike many high alcohol beers, this one does not have an overpowering alcohol flavor.

This smell fairly similar to most other impy stouts only this is a billion times better. Sweet smooth coffee, chocolate cinnamon, fresh baked bread, peach, this taste is fawking awesome. It like liquid dessert. The chocolate is so rich without being overly bitter. Alcohol comes through very mildly. Mouth feel is beyond smooth and creamy. Burnt marshmallow is showing up in the finish or this could possibly be vanilla. Just like the aroma the taste isnt all that different from other impy stouts its just way better than them somehow.

That bar just went up a notch in my book. Pours pitch black and thick, like motor oil, with a relatively thick head which yields some decent lacing. This beer is very roasty with lots of unsweetened chocolate and bitter black coffee, day old coffee, with a heavy dose of hops showing in the finish. It gets a bit softer and creamier as it warms a bit. Great beer. Not my favorite Imperial Stout though but I did just drink this in a bar and am now rating on memory. Ill re-rate.

1040,"2009-04-29",3.3,"Spring 2008 release. Bottle at The Penguin in honour of Nuneaton Boroughs heroic 10 man comeback against Chesham Utd in tonights play off semi final. Just wait and see whats coming out if we win in the final. Think this is one of the highest rated beers in my cellar, and its a disappointment. Pours a light-swallowing pitch with a chunky, dissipating tan collar. Aroma chocolate ice cream, charcoal, margarine, oak and faint burnt toast drenched in harsh spiritous alcohol; blended whiskey and rum. Tiny hint of raisin after its been standing half an hour. Reminds me of some kind of ill- advised Kahlua, rum and ice cream cocktail sucked through a straw. Slick, woodsy, spiritous but oddly thin body exuding oaky booze and fumes; the deep bittering roast, espresso, faint yeast extract and lush oaky cocoa tones which are there struggling to make themselves heard over the FAT HUM of alcohol. Could really use an infusion of hops or fruit or.. anything to complement the really simple charred flavours, and distract from the ABV. Its not even a very good stout, never mind a good 10.8% US imperial stout. Watery Marmite notes amongst the bonfire embers. Alcohol-sodden, charred impy without finesse or complexity- glad I didnt save it for a big rating milestone.

1040,"2009-04-27",3.9,"22oz bomber poured into a pint glass - 10.5% ABV

Appearance - Pours pitch black, with minimal head. Head has a slight tan hue, but nowhere as dark and tan as stones 12th anniversary stout. Nice lacing down the side of the glass.

Smell - hints of roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, roasted (but not burnt) malts. Real nice and appealing aroma.

Taste - Super complex -- can definitely taste the roasted malts and coffee. The malts come on pretty strong and taste slightly burnt. The slightly bitter finish is done pretty well. Real bold flavor that stays strong from start to end. Slight hoppy taste, but nothing like most of the stone beers. There is a bit of a thick syrupy taste, but its not sweet, but rather a roasted and smoked taste.

Mouthfeel - thick and carbonated -- tends to stick to your mouth afterwards, but executed above average. A little bit too much carbonation for my tastes. Gets better the further you drink, although still not exceptional (partially lending to the thick, burnt, syrupy like texture).

Drinkability - Smooth, complex, and a real in your face flavor. A little bit more complex than most Stone beers, but definitely tastes like a Stone beer. As with most Stone beers, the high APV isnt apparent in the taste, but hits you later. The high carbonation also puts this slightly back a bit.

Overall -- Some of the more complex flavors probably will come out better with aging, but definitely worthwhile. Overall, the burnt tone is a little excessive, but regardless on the good side. Im a big fan of complex beers (and a bit of a hophead on the side), and although this doesnt have the hops (I wouldnt expect so in a stout anyways), it does get high marks. However, from stones selection, Id probably prefer the everything but the kitchen sink stout (pilot beer #5) or the 12th anniversary bitter oatmeal chocolate stout much more over this one.

Finishing Notes -- Recommend pouring this into a pint glass straight rather than against the side to take off some of the carbonation tones. I have yet to try this on tap, but it probably would be significantly better than the bottle in my opinion. The burnt taste is a little much, but the other complex flavors make up for it.","San Diego, California, USA","waxhell"

Pours thick black with a thin cocoa head that dissipates rather quickly in a fine ring around the glass. Deep black in appearance with a bit of mahogany around the edges of the glass. Smell is rich in roasted malts with some slight aromas of dried fruits and smoke. The flavor is full of bitter chocolate, roasted malts and a bit of coffee. There is definitely an alcohol presence in the aftertaste but it is very nice. This beer is extremely drinkable, very well done.

Aroma is lots of sweet chocolate with with a sugary syrup sort of quality. Coffee beans and a nice bit of dark fruitiness help balance the sweetness. A nice background floral hop character adds to the complexity. Flavor starts with a surprisingly subtle sweet chocolate character. Gains a base fruitiness that begins to layer the flavors and adds a pepper spiciness along with roasted nuts. Finishes with a very nice mouth feel and not too much bitterness. Medium to full body and a rich complexity make this a all around great beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","FunkyBrewster"

1040,"2009-04-13",4.5,"The most drinkable Imperial Russian Stout youll ever taste. Pours a motor-oil black with a creamy, chocolate head. A big smell of bourbon and coffee beans emanates from the glass. A whiff unfolds layers of roasted malts, espresso, and dried fruits. Further investigation yields undercurrents of earthy hops and oak, something like cigar or leather, and a faint nuttiness. The flavor and aroma can be summed up as sweet, lightly fruity, and heavily roasted. Upfront it tastes like molasses and dark cherries, but this beer is awash in complimentary coffee, bourbon, and semi-sweet chocolate character. It even has what I perceive as a cola-like flavor, but unlike soda this beer is not sugary or syrupy. It has a rich, cocoa-like mouthfeel, and considering the alcohol content, actually finishes quite dry. It is more delicious than lapping at the blood of the unborn. Decadent and delightful.

The body pours a jet black with no light shining through at all.  The tight thin head is a deep smokey brown and lurks around the edges of the glass.  Aromas of rich sweet coffee and cocoa beans dominate my senses but traces of vanilla and caramel are present as well.  The body feels thin on my tongue with lots of alcohol soak and the feeling of extreme over carbonation.  The smokey chocolately body gets mixed up and bubbles around on the roof of my mouth leaving a dry bitter, almost hollow taste.  I feel like a drank a cold fizzy cup of espresso and took a shot of vodka.  There is a nice smokey after aftertaste, but the body is so hard to tolerate.

Aroma - Much lighter than I expected, I was expecting huge coffee and roastiness. I got more black currants and anise. I feel ripped off!!!
Flavor - Definite black currant and alcohol taste. I tend to agree with Pawola22 about this beer being delicate. I just expected more flavor!?
Palate - I am wondering why everyone says this beer has a heavy palate. The mouthfeel is kinda thin and does not poor thick at all. The finish is slightly dry and has alcohol aftertaste.
Overall - WOW am I in shock!!!! I have been waiting to try this beer for quite some time and I am not impressed!? I bought 4 bottles thinking this beer would be as good or better than Expedition Stout and I was wrong!! Re-Rate 4/21/09 -  I tried another bottle to see if maybe my taste buds were messed up. This beer is ok but has this charred wood taste that I dont like. Hopefully some age will make this beer taste better.

Pours dark like worn out motor oil with a consistency that well is even thicker than that.  Full bodied for this guy is putting it lightly.  On the initial flavor you get coffee, malt, toffee, roasted malt, chocolate and a sweet yet very subtle kind of fruit flavor.  Maybe the anise they have talkeda about with this one?  As this is hot I am getting what I affectionately call that bit of mystery in there that I can only guess will transform into something even better over time.  I had an 05 last summer and thought I was in beer heaven if there is such a place.  From vintages past chocolate seems to come out with age more then other characterisitcs that I have been able to tell.  I noticed coffee, malts, chocolate in the aroma.  Huge aroma that smacks you in the face.  I feel an outstanding representation of an imperial stout.  Wonderful does not even do this guy justice plus it is super easy to get around my area.

S - All roasted malts up front, with bittersweet chocolate coming through after. Theres a hop bitterness that pulls through towards the end. Its Stone, theres always hops somewhere.

T - Hint of espresso, followed by bittersweet chocolate flavors. As the beer lingers on the the tongue the espresso flavor returns, only much stronger this time.

1040,"2009-03-28",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2012 Re-rate on 1/22/2012. 22oz, 2010 Vintage from sefus12, big thanks to Beau for this one! Pours a pitch black body with a finger-width, dense and creamy, dark brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing throughout. Aroma is big chocolate malts with some chewy molasses evident from the aging. Slightly bittersweet dark cocoas with mostly rich, creamy chocolates. A nice roast remains behind the malts as well as some dried dark fruits, licorice, and a touch of char. Flavor is similar with lots of chocolate and caramel up front. Some chewy molasses, licorice spice, pruney and figgy dark fruits, a light bread, and some coffee in the middle. Roasts really come on nicely towards the end as this finishes dry and moderately bitter with an excellent balance between rich chocolates, molasses, slightly charred and heavier roasts, licorice spice, and a good amount of dull pine hops. Lengthy aftertaste following a full, slightly chewy body and a moderate carbonation. Overall, Im really digging this much more the second time around and this 2 year old vintage is drinking nicely. Lots of rich chocolates and slightly chewy molasses with a really nice dark fruitiness and licorice spice as well as plenty of balancing roasts and a firm hop bitterness. Really nice beer. (8,4,8,4,16=4.0). Original Rating on 3/28/2009. 2008 Spring release, 12oz bottle. Pours a deep black body with a thin, light brown head that leaves a lot of nice, swirly lacing. Aroma is not what I expected. I expected the big, pungent roast, rich chocolate and dominating bitter hops smell...but what I got instead was a very delicate and pleasant aroma. Lots of raisin/prune and creamy dark chocolate. Very light coffee roast and fruity hops along with a bit of warming booze in the nose. Quite compelling aroma. The flavor is very similar in its delicacy, yet something is throwing me off about this. There are a lot of dried fruits/raisin/prune and it seems to balance well with a light amount of dark chocolate, but theres something off with the roastiness and booze flavor. Its as if the roasts are present, but the light pruney booze flavor wont let it fully come through. Its as if this beer were a nightclub in that the raisins and mellow dark chocolates were in the club while the booze stood as the doorman and didnt let the roast inside. The roast is present, just not fully coming through. Definitely not enough coffee or roast in the aftertaste. I only get a little bit when I breathe out and attempt to taste it. The finish is more of the raisin mixed with booze and dark chocolate. As I mention the booze in the flavor, it never becomes overpowering at all, rather is just seems to stay slightly subdued and fruity while never letting a roast flavor come through. Ugh, hard to explain this one. Palate is rather thin and silky while slowly drying in the finish. Overall, this is a tough one to explain, but I tried. Something is a little off and I guess it would be the inadequate amount of roast/coffee in the backend of the flavor. Hmm...good stuff and definitely worth a $2.99 12oz bottle, but a little over-rated IMO. (8,4,7,3,14=3.6).","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Aroma- Oaky esters and dark dried fruit.  A faint hop aroma.  Alcohol aroma is present.
Appearance-  Black and murky with very little head.
Flavor-  Chocolate, burnt wood, oaky esters are present.  Pine hop flavor with strong bitterness at the end.  No sourness.  Not a huge alcohol taste.  Malt and hops are both strong, yet both are strong without achieving too much balance.
Palate- High carbonation, heavy body. Bitterness makes the back of my mouth feel dry.
Overall Impression- It is chewy, but drinkable.  I think the esters make this beer.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Dmalone102"

1040,"2009-02-13",4.2,"2006 bottle 05/14/2007

Cellared for a year. I poured this beer into my snifter and it was a dark black with slight brown edges. A short brown head faded quickly until no bubbles were left. The smell was slightly chocolate. The taste was vinous and reminded me of wine. There was a little plum flavor going on. This was much better than the 2007 bottle I had a couple weeks back but this can probably still use a year on it.

2007 bottle 02/23/2008

Beautiful smell like gourmet chocolates, an amazing improvement over the last year. This beer is a really good example of a cellar-worthy beer.

2006 bottle 04/20/08

This is about two years old now and Im a little disappointed in how its aged. It doesnt taste as good as the 07 I had a couple months back. It has almost six bubbles total and no carbonation. It is sticky sweet but no chocolate or roasty flavors, mostly dark fruits. hopefully this will pick back up in a couple months.

But what a treat: Pours an inky solid black with a brief loose-bubbled dark brown head - darker than any head Ive ever seen - which disappears all to quickly leaving no trace, not even lacing, which is something Ive noticed in aged beers. Wonderful enticing aroma - butter tart with dark sweet raisins and fancy molasses. So pungent, is the aroma that I probably spent more time inhaling than imbibing. Taste does not disappoint. While maintaining the requisite roastiness of a great stout, the raisin and molasses flavours really come out, as well as warming but not burning alcohol. Very fruity and complex with a hop taste that doesnt conflict at all, lightly oily but unobtrusive. Thin but oily and coating body with decent carbonation that serves its purpose.

1040,"2008-11-20",4.7,"Pours black as night with a thumbs worth of tan head with little retention or lacing until swirled around a bit.

Smell is of dark roast coffee, a bit of molasses, and dark chocolate.

The molasses hits the tongue right away immediately followed by the dark roasted coffee. The chocolate then splits through and blends with what seems to be a slight dark fruit flavor, possibly prunes or dates. All of these swirl together in a nice creamy finish. The alcohol is very well masked.

The mouth feel is nice and viscous. The carbonation is balanced perfectly. Just where it all should be for the style.

For a mighty RIS, this one is extremely drinkable. The description on the bottle does it justice. An exquisite brew!

1040,"2008-11-20",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 10, 2009 Wow, what a great looking beer. This beer had a solid and thick pour. Did not look
watery at all. The head, even though I tried to get it to foam up a little did not foam up,

there is no chance of seeing through this black beer. Lovely range of aromas: coffee, chocolate,
, wood, roast, and some sweet which I cannot describe. I have to say so far this beer is great.
One comment about the aroma. It is not as pungent as I would like it be. The aroma isnt weak, but
it is not smack you in the face which is what I was hoping for. Wow, this beer has an amazing palate, 
it is very creamy and nice. I mean this beer is extra smooth. Not as good as my favorite imperial stout
Ten FIDY, but close. Ah the beer taste great, a nice bittering hop on the back of my tongue with some
great roast, chocolate, and coffee flavors just bursting on my tongue. This is a damn good imperial stout. 
The beer has a nice sweet finish. I would definitely drink this beer again. The beer leaves some nice
lacing behind. Overall, this beer looks good, tastes good, and smells pretty good. It is a little on the
expensive side for a 12 oz., but the Ten FIDY (which is my favorite imperial stout) costs 11$ for a 4 pack.

Upon first sip, I notice that this brew is not as viscous as I expected.  But the flavors are as rich as ever.  There is, firstly the crisp notes of roasts and dark chocolate.  This is followed by the introduction of a coffee-bitterness that will remain throughout the tasting experience.  In the mid-palate I thought some more milky chocolates as well as hops are revealed.  This imperial stout finishes on the bold note of espresso, wood, roasts and alcohol.

1040,"2008-10-02",3.5,"Den har godt nok ligget længe og ventet. Men det var også meningen. Fik den af Kenneth i foråret 2006. Farven er sort, skummet er brunt og forsvinder hurtigt. Duften er sherry/portvin, blommer, svedsker, rosiner, alkohol, lidt sød og mælkeagtig. Smagen er let støvet, gløgg, sprittet, mørke tørrede frugter, lidt bitter choko og igen lidt ""mælket"". Varmer lidt i halsen, let karboneret ikke så olieret som jeg egentlig havde forventet. Ikke rigtig noget bitterhed tilbage, den har mistet noget med tiden.

1040,"2008-09-27",4.4,"Pours black as night... a creampuff lighter brown head. Quite a nice looking glass, and it looks pretty thick. 

A huge roasted malt aroma on the front, with coffee notes and molasses. A little bit of a dark fruit at the very back of it all, but the other scents battle with it a little. Great to sniff over a few times to pick out specific aromas. Some nuttiness and hints of chocolate come through on top of the other features. This is an amazing smelling brew.

Heavy, thick, and viscous paired with a little shimmer of carbonation in there. A rich malt flavour on the front, definitely roasted grains... followed soon after with a little sweeter prunish like flavour. This is all as it approaches the mid-tongue, where the coffee roast bitterness starts to become more noticable and comes out on the finish. Some dark, Belgian chocolate like flavours floating through there, and upon finish, it leaves a wonderful lingering flavour of it all coming together at once. Lovely. Considering how huge it is, it’s very drinkable. I’d like to try aging some as suggested to see how things go, as this is quite a fresh bottle, and I found it to be very smooth already. I’ll certainly be going back for more.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","Proteus93"

A very nicely balanced IS whose taste is an equilibrium betwen a coffeish and chocolatey roasty maltiness and a dusty, bitter aromatic hops that end the taste and stick in the long bitter aftertaste.

Pours opaque black, with a half inch head of brown foam that arose with a stretch pour.
Errant dots of lacework and a few smears of froth in between sips, along with a partial skim coat.

Aromatics are laced with dark chocolate, roast coffee, nougat, and roasted barley.
A slightly sweet and herbal note rounds out the nose.

Thick and chewy mouthfeel with a creamy body. 

The pallet leads off with a heft of resinous hops under all the char and roast.
Heaps of bakers chocolate, espresso, and reduced caramel.
Bitter, drying, and rich. Alcohol is warming but hidden.

Finishes with lingering choco-roast, dark roasted coffee, and a hint of Kahlua.

A great example of the style, but it leaves me wanting more complexity.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","brewandbbq"

Appearance for both was blackness w/ light tan, dense froth head(not quite creamy). Mouthfeel for both was nice, I would call this medium bodied for a stout. As for the flavor, I picked up much more chocolatey/sweet flavors with only slight coffeeness to the newer sample while the older had a much more present coffeeness to it, and an almost bitter quality.

1040,"2008-07-06",3.9,"500th Rating: Poured from a 22oz bomber (2008 vintage) and served in a snifter.  This imperial stout poured an opaque black (a few mahogany highlights around the edges) with a thin head of dark tan foam that quickly settled into a lasting cap.  A decent amount of drippy lacing was left around the glass.  The aroma of the beer was made up of burnt malts, fresh coffee, milk chocolate, prunes, and moalasses.  The flavor consisted of very strong burnt malts, espresso, dark fruits, a hint of bakers chocolate, herbal, woody hops, and also some warming alcohol.  The mouthfeel was thick and full-bodied with light carbonation.  Heavily roasted notes totally take over, leaving little room for anything else.  Not overly complex.

Black color, dark brown head that quickly dissipated, I didn’t get the head the picture shows, but maybe my glass was dirty. Smell is very nice. Full of chocolate, dark fruit, piney hops, coffee, and I think some oak was present. Taste doesn’t let down either, chocolate in the beginning, coffee stepping in before a dry vanilla oak finish.

Poured this into a tulip glass. It looked like I expected. Totally black, with no light shining through. About a half inch of toffee colored head, which dissipated fairly quickly, leaving a ring around the edges. The head renewed itself each time I swirled the glass. Even as I approached the bottom of the glass, I still could not see my fingers through the beer. So far so good. 

This beer didnt have as much of an aroma as I was expecting. I could smell cocoa, coffee, some sweetness and some bitterness, but nothing overpowering. It did smell good, though. 

Now for the big moment, tasting this beast. Coffee, bittersweet cocoa, toffee. Not overly sweet or bitter, but you could taste both at once. Really good, but a bit on the rough side. Alcohol was fairly well hidden, but it was still apparent. 

Mouthfeel: Thick, chewy, warming. Similar in texture to a doppelbock. Not too much carbonation to cut through the thickness.Warmed the throat all the way down to the stomach.

Pours very dark (think motor oil but less viscous) with a nice tan head.  Initial aroma very apparent both with malt and hops.  Flavor is dark - dark chocolate, dark fruit, just dark.  You can certainly taste the initial alcohol but this mellows as the beer warms up.  It also is less apparent once youve had a few sips but thats probably due to the extremely high ABV setting in.

1040,"2008-06-23",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 6, 2009 Sampled with Jblauvs. Used motor oil pour with dark tan frothy head. Lacing is moderate to minimal, but still quite enticing. Pours thick like syrup- super viscous and impenetrable- this is certainly a heavy specimen. Aroma was evident even before pouring. Primarily heavily roasted malt with accents of coffee, dark dark chocolate, and vanilla. Dark fruit notes such as raisin and plum creep in there as well. Aroma is pronounced, robust and powerful while still maintaining a great degree of complexity. Time for the first sip: lets get one thing straight from the get go- alcohol is quite evident though not overpowering. Most evident in the aftertaste, but a slight initial burst is existant as well. Flavors are powerful- most apparent is powerful roasted, and almost burnt malt. Very roasty with chocolate and dark fruit noticeable. Roasty aspects are slightly overpowering, though to some extent residual sugars poke through to create a very moderate balance of sweetness and roasted malt. Hop character is nearly non-existent, not that it needs to be. Palate is wonderful. Feels thicker than it pours. Syrupy mouthfeel with caressing and smooth features malt with significant malt depth. Full bodied and perfect viscous nature creates quite the treat on the palate. Complexity is rivaled by few, and nearly every facet of this brew has been honed to perfection. Nearly every angle is covered, though it could use a bit of aging to smooth out that alcohol character. Malt character is extraordinary and flavors are bursting and incredible.

Pours opaque black into the glass with a 4-finger deep brown head, nice and frothy, leaving thick, soapy lace.... a beautiful pour.  The roasted grains, chocolate, coffee, currants, and slight vinous notes really jumped out at me from several feet away.  The flavors are impeccable... all of the aromas in a liquid explosion.  So much going on, and so reserved, with soft carbo levels and an extremely creamy mouthfeel.  Sweet and roasted takes on bakers chocolate, toasted grains, velvety espresso/coffee and smoked peat shine in a perfectly-integrated flavor palate.  The finish is very nicely bittered, not harsh, enhancing the overall effect.... and it lasts wonderfully.  A touch of alcohol makes its presence known on the side-palate toward the middle/end of the pull, but overall, the ABV is perfectly integrated (not hidden, but integrated).  What else can I say?

1040,"2008-05-31",4.6,"22 oz bomber poured black/dark brown with a generous tan head that left nice lacing. Terrific smell - dark chocolate, espresso, roasted malts, coffee. Roasted malts dominate the taste, chocolate and espresso are also strong flavors, with background of molasses and syrup. Full bodied, creamy smooth, not much carbonation. ABV certainly is not evident. This is my idea of what an Imperial Stout is supposed to be. I need a cigar.","Pacific Palisades, California, USA","RedSox2004"

Flavor is complex mixture of coffee, cocoa and chocolate, roasted malts, dark cherry, and vanilla.  Strong, bitter cocoa and coffee finish.  The alcohol is well hidden.

Alcohol is noticeable, but particular flavours such as coffee or chocolate are not.  Enough hops to try to balance things out, but not hop forward.  Not particularly impressed - and Im a big Stone fan and a pretty decent imperial stout fan.  Would aging it have helped?","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","sstackho"

The aroma was super chocolaty with undertones of wood and coffee.  The flavor is very rich with complex chocolates (at times dark, others sweet/milk), vanilla, and strong, tannic, roastiness.  The bitterness of the beer seemed not to come from hops, but rther from the roastiness.  Very beautiful balance without too too much alcoholic warming.  The year of bottle age seemed to do it a lot of good.  On the palate, it sits heavy, but is very decadently pleasing.  Fantastic beer.","Bloomfield, New Jersey, USA","dogfishho"

1040,"2008-05-29",4.8,"Bottle shared at the Bibendum Beer tasting in Skåne - and beer No 200! This gem was part of a great trade with ClarkVV, to whom I doff my cap across the Atlantic. It was a 2003 release with five years of aging in tow, with a wax seal added by Clark himself to ensure the seal remained airtight over the years. The reassuring pop and gunsmoke upon opening the bottle proved all the trouble was worth it.
Drinking this beer was a decisive case study in just what aging can do for a beer. All the rough corners Ive tasted in fresher bottle of Stone had been knocked off and the huge flavours rounded out. Sticky brown sugar, soft milk chocolate, delicate mocha expresso tones and chewy dark fruits. I could go on but Ill shut up and let the indulgent memory of drinking this beer take over.","Umeå, SWEDEN","lagomswedish"

Pretty hoppy for the style, and the coffee flavor dominates, with touches of molasses, cocoa powder, and herbs.

Perfect pour and appearance, with an aroma full of American hops and intensive malty goodness. Similar to Expedition, in that the second it touched my tongue theres flavour, and lots of it.

First Impression: Aroma is roasted, chocolate, nutty, and slightly metallic. Visuals are pitch dark body topped with a nice thick brown head, which dissipates in a few minutes but not completely. Lacing is nice.  Taste does not disappoint. A deep, hoppy, roasted flavor. Some coffee, some dark chocolate, some smoke, but just a touch. Alcohol is very well hidden. Palate is back of tongue, spongey, yeasty, and blunt, long, very tasty finish. Nicely done. A grave presence. Second Impression: an impressive beer by any standard, but a great stout. Surprisingly drinkable, deep, delicious, and so very well balanced. Stone does amazing things.

Flavor has lots of sugary components with chocolate and licorice dominating the sweetness.  Malts are roasted but not burnt and the coffee flavor is more mild and not as chewy/charred as other RIS.  Flavor finishes with dried fruits and dark, sticky fruits.  Creamy on the tongue, soft on the palate, coffee bitterness until the end and some nice, soothing alcohol heat.  The balance in this RIS is great.  The sweetness is balanced with a peppery flavor and aroma.  The creamy texture is balanced by the alcohol.  Well crafted, deserving of all the praise.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
1040,"2008-04-29",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 5, 2008 Pours pitch black with a dense one finger head which dissipates pretty quickly leaving a swirl of tiny bubbles on the top.  Lacing is excellent.  Smell is fairly typical RIS, with roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and some dark fruit.  It seemed a little boozy and on the bitter/burnt side of things but still pretty nice.  Big roasted malt flavor up front which quickly gives way to a nice blend of roasted coffee, chocolate and a nice raisiny fruit sweetness.  The aftertaste is bitter with an extended coffee flavor along with some hop bitterness.  Fairly thick mouthfeel and low carbonation leaves the mouth coated in creamy goodness.  This is a definitely a great RIS and it almost lives up to the hype.  I probably wouldnt put it in my top 3 for the style but I would actively seek it out.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

You can sniff at this one for a long while, but I found the aroma quite possibly the best part.  Lots of barnyard in the nose, undeniably so.  This is OK with me, as it was rounded out with lots of roasted things.  Body brings bold roasted flavors of coffee, raisins, wood.  Finish is dominated by the alcohol.

Perfectly weighted in the mouth. Thick enough to give an awesome body but never cloying. Rich and creamy. Very sweet but just about held in check by the bitterness from the generous hoppage.

Taste is great - burnt malts, some licorice notes, coffee.  The roast stays with you until the next sip.  The aroma is pretty subtle for an imperial stout.

1040,"2008-04-20",4.2,"2007 Vintage. Pours a viscous, thick jet black color. Completely opaque with some burgundy highlights when held up to the light. Pour initially forms a hefty 2"" dense tan head which gradually fades to a wispy coating of foam. Some spotty streaks of lacing as glass is consumed. Fairly assertive aromas of espresso coffee beans, dark roasted malts, molasses, dark choclate and dark dried fruits waft up from the snifter. Mouthfeel was moderately full and chewy. Seemed to become much fuller and smooth as the beer warmed. Flavors were a tad more assertive than the aromas. Starts off on the sweet side with a firm blast of dark rum soaked raisins and figs, dark cocoa, molasses and vanilla. The mid-palate reveals a transformation to a slightly bitter side with notes of burnt malts, espresso coffee, bakers chocolate and a touch of spicy hops.

1040,"2008-04-15",4.0,"bottle, 2008.  i couldnt wait.  pours black like space.  all hope drains as on tries vainly to search for some light to penetrate the blackness.  sorry, stone makes me poetical.  anyway, its black.  a reasonable light brown head rises up as the pour nears the top of the glass, and gradually fades to a film, where it remains for the life of the beer, leaving the occasional hint of lacing along its journey.  the first sniff is all cocoa and roasted malts.  as you let it sink in, theres a tiny hint of molasses and some black raspberries.  there is also a noticeable spiciness, some wood, and the slightest hint of alcohol.  mmmmm.  very roasty flavor, but somehow without a coffee-like character.  some more cocoa, and light alcohol that plays well in the bigger picture.  similar spice and wood characteristics, but the molasses note is all but gone (all to the good for me).  its a very clean malt flavor profile (virtually no esters), dominated by the roastiness, with a sprinkling of floral hops in the end.  the finish is a great balance, with light sweetness and moderate bitterness.  it reminds me of some of the better belgian darks in that regard.  tight bubbles give a certain airiness to the thick chewy body.  i want to say this is somewhat prototypical.  its the baseline for all imperial stouts, and it works well.  nothing in particular stands out, like the coffee-like roastiness of expedition, or the cocoa sweetness of siberian night, or the coffee-like coffee-ness of black hole.  its simply an exceptional example of the way the style was meant to be.  sort of what i would expect from stone.  just plain ol awesomeness.","pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","hiddenvariable"

Update 6/22/08: Had this on tap at the Ginger Man.  Smells very nice, strongly of coffee.  This is too green as the mouthfeel is heavy, cloying, and sweet.  Strong alcohol presence.  Needs to mellow and definitely should be aged at least 1 year.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LilBeerDoctor"
1040,"2008-04-14",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 28, 2009 Bomber sampled in wine glass (for lack of sniffer) and finished in pint glass.  VERY complex aroma including everything nice from an imp stout: tobacco, oak, rasins, dates, prunes, cocoa, coffee (espresso), yeasty dough, alcohol, molasses, smoke, and a very pleasing creamy vanilla ice-cream undertone.    Pours a motor-oil black with a moderate sized tan/mocha head that was creamy/frothy.  Not a huge head but lasted and provided nice lacing.  Flavor was less impressive than aroma but still great; it was dominated by molasses, hints of roasted coffee beans, oats, oak, and alcohol.  It had an interesting bitter dark chocolate flavor coming in well after the finish.  Silky smooth on the palate with a light alcohol warmth that gets stronger as beer gets warmer, but the alcohol is hidden very well in general for the abv.  Thinner on the palate than expected but still palate coating (full bodied).  Oily texture with soft creamy carbonation.  Overall: very good; nice and stomach warming; very impressive aroma; very rich and classic imp stout.

RERATE (Not really, since this is after having finished the bomber I speak of above):  I started drinking this brew (half a wine glass) at room temp. and found its taste to be quite a bit more pleasing with a little more chill on the brew (maybe around 50 or 55).  Even better than I thought.  One bomber is quite intoxicating too.  Cant wait to try to one I got for aging in 3 or 4 years.


(REAL RE-RATE) Thick and delicious like the last one, but smoother around the edges than I remember.  It tasted fresher too (perhaps because of the 20008 vintage).  Chocolate, vanilla, and booze (warming and pleasant booze though) dominate this brew and your face when you take a bomber of it down.

(ANOTHER RE-RATE)
2009 Bomber.  Nice black body with a good lacing brown head.  More soy on the body than I remember (and than I like).  Not bad by any means, but not as good as anticipated.  Either it isnt as good as earlier vintages, or I have lost my unwincing love for imperial stouts (I;m leaning towards the latter).","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

1040,"2008-04-01",4.2,"22oz bomber. Pours a deep dark brown with a head the color of a chocolate milkshake, which slowly draws down to a thin covering. Excellent lacing. Nose is complex and luxurious, with a lovely melange of coffee, malt, chocolate, licorice and raisins.

Aftertaste brings out an herbal note, with the alcohol and hops making a perfect counterpoint. To me, the beauty of this experience lies in the fact that one bottle is all I need - a second bottle would be too much.

The taste is similar to the aroma with complex flavors of roasted/blackened malts, espresso, biter chocolate, black walnuts, dark fruits and anise. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, the palate is full and well rounded, and the carbonation is lively and perfect for this style. The finish is long with lingering biter walnuts and dark chocolate.

This beer is no Dark Lord; however, the flavors are extremely similar and pleasant.  The most immediate difference is the palate - this has a rather thin mouthfeel  as compared to a Dark Lord.

A medium, foamy, dark khaki head settles to just a minimal edge, leaving delicate sheets and random spots of lacing behind.  The aroma is rich and decadent, with velvety dark chocolate, sweet caramel, roasty coffee, smooth mocha, and earthy star anise coming together wonderfully.  Flavors are nearly as impressive, with all of the aforementioned elements melting together into a smooth, rich, luxurious experience.  At nearly 11%, the alcohol is masterfully hidden behind the dessert-like flavors, with just the slightest warming bite on the finish.

1040,"2008-02-20",4.7,"2007 vintage. 22oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass (consumed: 2/14/08)

A: Pours a thick, viscous dark brown with an equally dark brown 1-finger head. Holding it up to the light reveals some ruby colors around the beers edges; it even sparkles a bit after the initial pour. Phenomenal looking.

S: An almost-overwhelming rich, intoxicating bouquet of chocolate and roasted malts, backed up by even more cocoa, with the slightest hints of a floral hoppiness left.

T/M: Amazing. I cannot believe this is the same beer I had back in April when it was fresh, its an entirely new beer already. Its *very* rich, a dessert chocolate mousse is the closest flavor I would describe this to be. As it warms, even more bittersweet cocoa comes out, as well as luscious dark cherries dripping in sinfully palate-watering juices. The beer doesnt so much as coat your mouth as it does vanquish anything else thats in there, with an oatmeal-like oil slick quality. Exxon Valdez has nothing on this beer.

D: Far, far too easy to drink for a beer thats over 10% ABV. I kept reaching for another sip, it was very difficult to let this warm properly as it was deliciously potable from the get-go. Highly, highly recommended.","Wood Ridge, New Jersey, USA","markgugs"

Pours silky smooth black with a thin tan head.  The head is not overly foamy, but will take a bit to dissipate.  Gorgeous to look at.  I got a strong (but not overbearing) coffee aroma in the nose, strong roasted notes and some mild dry fruit (is that what black currant smells like???).  This one just dances across the palate.  I think that great brewers make a great stout - the pretenders make an overly bitter, overly aromatic brew.  Stone just nailed this one.  Bitterness without being overbearing.  Strong malty flavor.

Pours black as night into a stemmed tulip creating a dark brown dense head that disappears all too soon leaving some lacing, but for the most part it was pretty lifeless. Somewhat disappointing as I had been waiting a year before opening this one. Aromas of chocolate and roasting coffee mask the alcohol well. Taste was excellent. The hops were muted and the malts shone through. Big and thick mouthfeel coats the mouth and throat while alcohol persists. Some dark fruits and sweetness but not what I expected. This was a lot easier to drink than I thought it would be. I expected a bomb of a stout (see DFH WWS) but it wasnt. Dont get me wrong- it was still a great Stout.

The beer was simply far too sweet to be enjoyable.","San Francisco, California, USA","DubC5000"
1040,"2008-01-26",4.8,"2007 vintage poured into a pint glass. The beer is murky and black; the carbonation struggles to make its way to the top where it crests as a beautiful tan froth of a bit less than an inch.

Immediately my nose is pummeled with scents of chocolate and coffee, as well as a subtle alcohol sharpness.

The balance in this beers taste is impeccable; like eating a chocolate-covered coffee bean it starts out sweet and then melds seamlessly into a slightly bitter roasty flavor. Booziness makes an appearance as the beer warms.

The mouthfeel here is just exceptional. Full bodied with just enough carbonation to prevent it from being cloying. Ridiculously smooth.

Sinister, strong, powerful, with an aura permeating from the brew. The label is an excellent portrayal of the feeling I get when I am drinking the black liquefaction of malt and hops. The initial yeasty aroma (the only negative I can say about the beer) quickly dissipates to a caramel chocolate spicy aroma. The initial taste is a bit sour and tangy but not overbearing. Semi-sweet, spicy, with nutty alcoholic flavors (port, brandy, rum all seem to come to mind) kick in. The alcohol content (9.5%) becomes more noticeable as you continue. The brews strong finish and the excellent lacing are a major plus.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","GaltScat"

1040,"2008-01-23",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 13, 2008 Re-rate 7/30/08:  On tap at Lucky Baldwins and also 2008 vintage bottle.  Both experiences fail to live up to previous encounters with this beer.  There is no smoothness, no vanilla, and malt dominance has reared its head.  As with many Stone beers in the last year, the previous craftsmanship is missing to me.  Bottle on Jan 13 2008: An earlier version of their now-dominant RIS, this one lacks the word Russian in the name, therefore lacks the Russian hat on the gargoyle, and is also missing about 2% ABV.  To my taste, it also is missing the signature vanilla smoothness of its modern cousin, concentrating instead on the coffee/dark chocolate bite that one might normally expect.  The bottle I had was 5 years old (2003) procured from Sam at the Stuffed Sandwich.  Earlier Rating: 11/6/2007 Total Score: 4.6On tap at Stuffed Sandwich.  Consistently one of the best beers in the world; my review couldnt add to or clarify the accolades, but I will note that this is the cleanest, sweetest Imperial Russian I have had -- the only one with notes of vanilla.  Quite an achievment to have a smooth - almost light - IRS with all the inebriating effects of its huge-tasting cousins.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"

Im guessing that not too many people in Isla Vista drink this stuff, so it was probably sitting there since the spring.   Pours nearly solid black, but theres a little brown around the edges.   No head, only some light brown lace.   Sweet chocolate, vanilla, and almond aroma.   Flavors of dark chocolate, prunes, roasted coffee.   Doppelbockish.   Thick and syrupy, but not overly so.   Very rich and alcoholic.   Was fantastic for the first glass, but by the end of the bomber it became a little cloying and intense.   I think Ill share it next time. Ƙ,4,8,4,16=4)
Rerate: 2009 release.   Quite sweet, with a burnt toast and damp grain flavor.   Definitely a different animal than the 2008 or 2007 releases, and not as likable for me.   The only bottle that I think deserved a 4 was the almost year-aged one that I first rated.   Hopefully this release will come together with some age, but right now its a pretty average stout. 7,4,7,4,14=3.6 Ɩ/6/2009).

Rerate:  2009 release.   Seems to be coming along after three more months at room temp.   This one really does seem to need a little time after release, and I have high hopes for another year or more.   The flavor is nicely balanced between burnt fruit, molasses, hop bitterness and charred malt.   Alcohol is pretty smooth already.   The nose is actually pretty dull at this point, though still pleasant, with some vague preserved fruit and burnt wood.   Mouthfeel is nice, with creamy carbonation and a heavy weight.

As I was pouring, the color was dark as night and there was no head whatsoever...but wait...after the pour, the beauty head appeared, nice lacing also.

1040,"2007-12-29",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 12, 2009 Side by side vertical of the 05, 06 and 07 releases. All three vintages were in 22oz bombers. I drank all three out of the same exact style of glasses, beginning with the youngest release. 

Aroma:
07: Dark malts, alcohol and dark over-ripe fruits.
06: Very subdued compared to the 07. I mostly get alcohol with just a hint of malt. 
05: Sweet caramelly malts bounce off my nose. Alcohol in the background. 

Appearance: 
All three years pour almost exactly the same color, basically pitch black. The 05 may be a touch darker in color, the 06 and 07 seem to have more brown highlights. The 05 had very little head at all and the 06 and 07 had a thin, but dense brown head that faded quickly to just a ring around the glass. 

Flavor:
07: Dark fruits hit me first, then the sweet dark maltiness, than the alcohol.
06: Very sweet. Kind of a caramelly brown sugar flavor throughout. Dark sweet malts/fruits pop-up towards the finish.
05: Mellow sweetness up front. Tangy but sweet dark fruit taste through the middle. A little boozey tingle on the finish. 

Palate:
07: The thickest of all three, crisp carbonation.
06: Thick but a touch watery, somewhat subdued carbonation.
05: Thick, coats the mouth more so than the others. 

Overall: Needless to say this brew is great. The 06 has always been my favorite but there is something I like about the 07. Probably the more vibrant carbonation. If I dont have an aggressive barrel aged beer to drink than this is a solid call. 

2004 on-tap at Stone a ways back. Pours black with a thin, creamy, tan head and good lace. Smells dark and sweet syrupy roasty malty.

Feels full in the mouth with a perfect touch of carbonation. Smooth as silk and the alcohol is extremely hidden considering the high ABV.

1040,"2007-12-10",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 20, 2008 i had this in 2008 it was not what i recall of the great beer. I personally would like to only remember it the way it was.

*I LOVE IT I will buy it as often as I can!!* 

this was a 2005 bottle I got from Dano213, CHEERS! 
This is my first tasting of an aged RIS.. I think my palms are sweaty. 

App: the only reason I did not go for the full 5.0 here is that it is not magically enchanting, sounds dumb.. but I have seen some big stouts that seem to swirl and shimmer. Other than that, it has a nice sturdy head and all the right colors for the types of beers I like. 

Smell: Got some rasin type smell, dark deep lucious grains in the nose, some booze, but the smell is not huge, not big amounts of cocoa, or huge amounts of coffee. Its a good smell just not huge. 

Taste: first sip, so scared.. tasted a small hint of trash can,wich is the word i think i use for the bad OX word. I said OH NO!, and then leaned in for another sniff, and another gulp... SAFE! no trash can! just rich huge drinkable wonderful stone ris. I will note, it is hard for me to give a down to earth review cause this beer is my lil sip of heaven. I love fat dog, I love Old raspy, I love Wake n bake, I thought storm king was pretty good, just weak for me, I liked the peche imortal coffee stout thingy, but found it a bit to grainy tasting, dog fish head wws, well thats a diff animal, but it was ok. loved dog woods youngblood porter.. the list goes on of my fav beers, BUT this one is king for me. my taste discription is this, take all those, besides some of the stronger coffee flavors, and take out the bitternes and dry mouth (fat dog) the sometimes trashy and overly booze flavor (old raspy) and add more richness, more creamy thick gooey mouthfeel and plant your self in dark beer heaven. 

MF: huge, very full without drying your tounge up or coating the back of your mouth with that snot feel. 

drinkablity: VERY, I have trouble not chugging the thing. If I had a bunch of these around I would soon be laying on the floor in a pile of bottles. 


This is my favorite beer, this bottle was a reminder of that. Cheers to Stone, cheers to Dano, and cheers to Chaingangguy who I had the treat to enjoy this beer with.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","Ando"
1040,"2007-12-09",3.9,"Bomber.  From Spring 2007, had now in December 2007.  Big salty chocolate aroma with a surprisingly lithe hop component even after these months.  Rich and meaty, some roast with fruit and a fair bit of decently-integrated alcohol.  Dark brown head, bubbling and soapy, aboard what I usually describe as ""soul sucking"" blackness.  Taste is very roasty but not overly bitter, chocolaty with a nice, dry profile in the aftertaste.  Fat, full body with a little hop prickle, dry and roasted with a touch of wood.  Flashes of berry here and then there, and very, very salty!  Alcohol is superbly integrated.   Superbly balanced and nuanced, yet big and impressive.

1040,"2007-10-26",4.1,"Ive been waiting to rate this one for awhile.  Poured from a bomber into a neat little tumbler I just bought.  Pours a deep black car, very similar to motor oil.  Thick and sludgy.  The head is a moderately thick, with a beautiful caramel color.  The aroma is of dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt and a noticeable alcohol.  Chocolate and alcohol dominate the flavor.  This beer is not overly carbonated and goes down very very well.  Stone just continues to impress me with every offering of theirs that I try.","New York, New York, USA","patty26"

1040,"2007-10-19",4.6,"22oz bottle poured in a tulip glass.  I am very excited!  Thank you beerbill for this one.  This absolutely gorgeous beer beer pours black as night with a creamy chocolate milkshake head.  It smells like molasses and honey.  Its a little on the cold side now so theres a hint of metal in the flavor.  I fully expect that to go away as it warms up to a more appropriate temperature.  It has a thick coating body that will absolutely ruin any additional beer tasting you may have in mind.  It feels like milk but the alcohol leaves a nice warmth in your belly.  Chocolate, anise and roasted twigs are notable.  There is a dark fruit sweetness as well.  Maybe its raisin.  The alcohol aftertaste is a wonderful topper to this world class brew.  I like to think that Russians are sitting around drinking this kind of beer daily.  Alas I think its just a dream but coupled with this beer Russia is a mysterious Valhalla where burned out Cold War spies go to find emotional comfort in the arms of Russian women and a beer like this.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MrRain"

Dark chocolate on top of cocoa aroma (chocolate squared)with some wafts of peppery booze and Italian-roast coffee beans.  Rich bittersweet bakers chocolate flavor with a slightly smoky roastiness and noticeable hop bitterness on the finish. Smooth mouthfeel with a slightly peppery alcohol bite.  Maybe some underlying black licorice and dried berry hiding behind the alcohol.  My guess is that it would improve greatly with a few cellar years, but even now its very nice.

Its aging really well right now, with some of the aggressiveness that characterized the initial pours (most notably a strong hop presence still intact, albeit somewhat mellowed).

A hint of leather, wood, and alcohol.  Strong notes of tawny port, licorice, red wine, and berries.  Average sized, creamy, light brown head that mostly diminished and left virtually no lacing.  Very dark black/ reddish-brown hue.  Flavor is moderately sweet and bitter with a saltiness on the average finish.  Full bodied and oily flat.  Alcohol is there in the finish but light and acceptable.  I have been wondering what a 5 out of 5 would taste like and what better day than my B-Day for it to happen.  I figure if the scale goes up to 5 there has to be brews that deserve it and this is it.  I love the complexity of the aroma, the classic stout appearance, the bitter sweet flavor, and the full bodied palate that burns a little on the finish.  There might be slightly better brews somewhere but Im not going to reserve a 5 rating for just one beer.  This brew is the best example of its style.","Saginaw, Michigan, USA","polomagnifico"

1040,"2007-09-14",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 2, 2009 I bought this at Austin Liquers in Mass about a month and a half ago, so its atleast that old. Pours as dark as motor oil.

Flavour reflects the aroma, with lots of chocolate and caramel, with some licorice, and a smooth vanilla finish. Warm alcohol feeling. A thick, but velvety smooth mouth feel. Top Notch.

I just had a few more of these that have been aged for almost two years, I gotta say, I prefer the younger version better. It seems the older these beers get the more the black licorice anise finish slowly fades away and the beer becomes more smokey and roasty in character....still delicious though.","Guelph, CANADA","wilderthanyou"

A full bitterness ensues, full of toasty nuts and coffee.  As the beer warmed up, notes of the promised black currants developed.  A pleasingly mild astringency salutes the departure of the beer, accompanied by a subtle alcohol burn down the throat.

There is a lasting bitterness in every sip from the coffee, licorice, and (I know the commercial description says, ""black currants,"" but--) prune flavors.

Deep layers of malt complexity built in with notes of the obligatory chocolate and coffee, but with a slight hint of anise on the tale-end.

Appearance: Oh my, yes. Pours out a rich, inticing jet black body. The foamy tan-colored head recedes quickly.

Smell: The welcome aroma delivers a sweet scent filled with rich espresso, roasted barley, molasses, and anise. A soft scent of port wine can also be found here. Lastly, an inspiriting alcohol vapor fills the nose.

Taste: While tasting this beer I scribbled some complimentary notes down on a notepad, but didnt get all of them because I went through the worlds entire supply of ink and paper in the process. 

The worlds entire supply of ink and paper, I said.

That said, this brew is tremendously malty, with sharp notes of coffee and chocolate. Undertones of vanilla and molasses are present as well. Hop flavor is gentle, barely peeking through the immense gamut of flavors present. Yes, the alcohol is apparent, but quite soothing.

The long finish leaves a sustaining roasted flavor on the tongue. Delicious.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and quite chewy at times, while maintaining an unequaled velvety texture. 

Drinkability: The very best RIS Ive tasted yet.

So, yeah, I liked it. I had very high expectations for this beer, and it met every single one of them.

Dont get me wrong. Its still a great beer. I just think I was expecting too much. The aroma kept changing as it warmed. Plavor is much the same as the aroma, but with a hop finish. It was a little harsh, but should become very nice. Harsh in some ways but still well balanced. If the start of the finish was the only flavor, it wouldnt ber very good, but the two balance each other out.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured an opaque, dark brown that appeared black in the glass with a small, light brown head that fully diminished and left virtually no lacing. The aroma was chocolate syrup and mild coffe anlong with alcohol and dark fruit. The initial flavor was moderately to heavily sweet and lightly to moderately bitter, while the finish was heavily to harshly sweet and heavily bitter with a surprisingly short duration for an imperial stout.

re-rate: 2010 spring release bottle, drank 2010. Pours black, slightly red. Again, less viscous than, say, Great Divides Imperial Stout. Aroma is indisputably perfect.  Hits the mouth and has a moment of sweetness, but turns into bitterness. Flavor: sweet milk, dark chocolates, bourbon for sure, espresso at the end. 10.5%? Yeah right, youre joking...

1040,"2007-05-21",4.7,"Rated 7/4/06:  Spring 2006 edition, I wanted to let this cellar longer but to be honest it never stood a chance I had to open this up and try it. Pours pitch black into my imperial pint glass reminds me of motor oil, very slick and thick. Large brown head that soon becomes nothing and leaves no lacing I expected this due to the very high abv. Aroma is fantastic blending sweet malts, dark roasted malts, licorice, and even smells like plums and raisens. The aroma also gives off an insanely strong alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is perhaps the best Ive ever experienced, this is the fullness and thickness Ive been looking for and a smooth finish to boot you can almost feel the alcohol evaporate before you ultimately swallow. Flavor is phenominal sweet fruity yet dark and bitter. Two opposites clash but yield a wonderful taste, if only that strong alcohol wouldnt kick so hard this is near perfect especially for this style. The licorice and dark fruits also repeat themselves in the taste. Surprisingly sweet and smooth this is nice on the palate, overall a truly wonderful creation.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"
1040,"2007-05-18",4.4,"Bottle from Oak Tree Buy Rite and linked from Dantheman.
I think what makes this a great beer is its drinkability (I stole that from the other site). The hops definitely rule but I prefer hops and Ruination while were at it. But this has balance with dark chocolate, almond, toffee, roasted coffee, raisin-like malts, some citric grapefruit in the aftermath, and literally hundreds of other elements that can be discerned. As this warms up, I notice more. The alcohol is pretty obvious in the dry palate along with some acidity which is a tad bit unpleasant. There is also some nice smokiness here underneath the flavors. I do think a greater malt ratio would even this beer but I like what they mixed. The trademark Stone hoppiness seems to accentuate this style.

Mouthfeel smooth, a bit oily, a little looser than I might have expected, and a little more fizzy as well. Thin rings of fine weepy lacing. Flavor carries all of the elements of the aroma, and also features currants, plum, perhaps cherry, and a lovely doppel-like smokiness.

Tastes real dessert-like, which is another surprise, and a good one!  Lots of chocolate, some coffee, caramel, rum, red wine, and slight grassy hop flavor.  Finishes with dark roast coffee, wood, grass and is actually not as big as I would have hoped, making for a thin aftertaste.

1040,"2007-05-15",4.4,"I drank this beer to celebrate the completion (whether successful remains to be seen) of my last final of law school.  Thanks to Darkelf for the trade.  This was an early Summer 2005 release and has been in my basement for about 2 years. The beer is an English style imperial stout.  It is low on the hops and heavy with sweet malt.  The aroma has roasted grain, sweet fruit, and red wine.  A nice looking beer, oily and thick with not much of a head, and a nice shade of purple hiding in the blackness.  Flavor is intense with sweet, syrupy malt goodness, more wine, maybe just a little port.  The high abv sneaks up on you.  The alcohol is there in the flavor but well hidden.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"

Bomber bottle, pours black with dark tan bubbles, chocolate cake and roasted malt aromas, a faint coffee fragrance, some dark chocolate, real faint smoke fragrance (reminisce of Stones Smoked Porter), the smoke does not take away at all from the brew, a faint fruit-flower fragrance (from the hops?), roasted malt and coffee flavors, some bitter chocolate taste, some alcohol on the tongue, there is a faint burnt/charred wood taste, from dark roasted malt?

The flavor is heavy on soy sauce (especially as it warms), sweet, some alcohol, bakers chocolate, and very roasted. The palate is thick and smooth with predominate roast.

This is definitely the best bottling of the IRS Ive had.  2005 was pretty good, smooth, balanced, with vanilla tones.  2006 was pretty bad; I got kind of drunk drinking it in public with a friend during the day, and the beer itself didnt stand up to that experience...it was too hoppy, fresh, metallic, all those bad things.  The 2007 is really amazing.  The aroma is a little weak, but the flavor is just a perfectly smooth progression of anise, bourbon, bitter chocolate powder, vanilla.  Creamy and delightful; not terribly overpowering, just great.  I love that the coffee tones in this are so subtle; I really dont like too much coffe in a stout.  I think ""coffe stout"" should be its own category, into which Speedway, Expedition, Founders, Blackout, etc. should fall.  Anyway, great beer!","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

1040,"2007-05-02",4.1,"Culmination of ratings of vintages 02, 03, 04, 05. Ive decided to eliminate the 2006 batch from this group, as it was unimpressive and this beer seems to shine after a year or more of aging anyway. Pours midnight black, magenta glints at the perimeter. A firm mid-sized brown head forms and holds magnificently. Looks tantalizing, though very standard. Luckily the true pleasures of this beer lie within the aroma, moreso in the flavor and mouthfeel. Heavily roasted grains and dark chocolates comprise the bulk of the aroma, the sweet chocolate notes acting as a worthy counterbalance to the bruising and hefty dose of roastiness. Hops are muted at the one year mark, but still provide an ample connotation of citrus. Coffee aromas permeate the air surrounding the glass; while not luxurious they are hearty and well recieved. Anise and indistinguishable berries dutifully round out the nose. Alcohol is quite noticeable at cooler temperatures, but fades nicely as the beer warms and the roastiness and chocolate gain strength in delivery. The flavor is distincly hoppy, the bitterness employed from these plants teaming up with toasted grain creates quite the battery. Sweetness from caramel malts and alcohol is strong as well, just intense enough to make this taste very balanced, for an imperial stout. Rich and thick, the palate is caressing and slightly stinging altogether. Full bodied mouthfeel may garner its intrinsic definition from a beer like this one. Finishes rich and sweet, caramel and chocolate notes drying to leave a puckering flitter in the back of the cheeks. A very good beer, though many samples have proven that this is a very inconsistent product. Or, perhaps, so complex it plays out very differently each time its enjoyed. Each go around, its definitely enjoyed. An explosive, crushing blow from Stone is always exciting.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

1040,"2007-04-10",4.9,"This beer is fantastic in every way. The head is a gorgeous dark brown/red, while the brew itself filled me with awe as I poured it. Jet black (but actually an extremely dark red/brown) beer poured from the bottle and filled my glass. Strong, wonderful aroma and a very full, intricately complex flavor. Let this beer warm, and youll experience the wonderful roasty undertones and subtly spiced body in a whole new way! Definately an utterly fantastic brew!","Allendale, Michigan, USA","BeNobleDark"
1040,"2007-04-09",4.4,"Spring 07 Bottle.  Whats not to like about the appearance?  It looks like a beautiful dark imperial stout.  Aroma is really interesting.  Started with apple cinnamon, vanilla, caramel.  Later some fruityness and some musty notes.  Flavor is quite smooth, I was expecting it to be more bold, especially since its such a fresh bottle; well balanced.  It has lots of rich chocolatey-coffeeish notes, and I can definitely taste the black currants.  The mouthfeel has lots of structure, it is smooth and oily.  Overall this was quite nice.  This is the first year Stone has been distributed in my area, and Im glad to try this!","Santa Cruz, California, USA","amorphiss"
1040,"2007-04-09",4.2,"Bottle, 2007 Vintage, poured a almost pitch black with dark brown edges and a decent dark tan head. Aromas of roasted coffee, caramel, dark fruits, anise and a few other things that i could not pin down.  Great flavor, very rich and complex, lots of dried fruits and hoppy bitterness.  Actually fairly balanced for an Impy Stout.  Flavors got more robust as the beer warmed.  Luscious mouthfeel and a complex and bitter finish.  A wonderful beer and not ""overdone"" like a lot of other stone beers.","The Land of Milk and Honey, Ohio, USA","Cliff"
1040,"2007-04-09",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 25, 2011 2007 bottle.  Pour is opaque black with a dark tan, pillowy, creamy, fairly large head; it diminishes in some time with fair  lacing.  Nose is nice but not spectacular; notes of dark chocolate, chicory, moderately roasted coffee with earthy tones, light anise, some fusel alcohol, and an obscure fruit note (probably the black currant from the description).  Palate is thick and full, viscous, even a little oily with moderate carbonation and noticable alcohol warmth (but never hot).  Flavor is daker and roastier than the nose led on; the fruit note is more apparent and is currant-like and starts the flavors.  The tastes progress darker and more bitter as it progresses; burnt caramel, dark chocolate, coffee bitterness, and slight anise, followed by fairly roasted notes.  It ends bittersweet with earthy bitterness, lots of coffee roast, and dark, dark chocolate.  You would expect Stone brews to be in your face, which this definately was, but from such high scores, I thought this was going to be a little more complex.  This sure seems like a beer that would excellent to age for many years, hopefully gaining the complexities of average Stone big beer.  For what it is, it is good but considering the style, it did not leave an incredibly lasting impression, despite the good score.  Solid, simple, flavorful, certainly dark and viscous, just no WOW factor.



2008 bottle.  The nose seems to have some more cocoa and milk chocolate notes in place of some of the darker notes.  The rest remains similar; aging this one seems necessary.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Aroma is strong of coffee and chocolate, heavy on the roasted malt.  Taste reminded me of chocolate on a graham cracker... with roasted malt and coffee.  Some subtle, underlying bitters and hints of the higher abv.  Excellent.  Score = 4.5

<P>Re-rate, now that Ive had this on multiple occasions/vintages/time aged, etc.  Still comes in with a strong overall rating.  The most recent batch I sampled was an 07 aged 18 months.

1040,"2007-03-16",4.9,"Just picked up a case of the 2006 release.

This beer pours a thick tar like black. It has a dark brown head that fades a little fast. It leaves many laces. Absolutely no light shines through the murky depths of this beer.

This beer has a rich coffee like aroma. It smells very malty. Roasted barley is present. It has a dark chocolate aroma also. It smells slightly hoppy.

This beer has a strong chocolate like flavor. It tastes slightly of coffee. The alcohol content is apparent in the flavor. This beer is a little more hoppy than I expected. It has a small taste of dark fruits. Plumbs and rasins.

This beer is very thick. It is low in carbonation. It is surprizingly smooth, considering how massive a beer as it is. It leaves a bittersweet chocolate aftertaste. The alcohol warms slightly as it goes down.

Although this beer is high in alcohol, I have had it as a session beer before. I get a little buzzed, but it works. I think I could drink this beerall week long. I would like to install a drinking fountain in my garage that pumps this beer out.","San Diego, California, USA","OStrungT"
1040,"2007-03-11",4.3,"The aroma was chocolate and strong malt and an estery bit of banana as the head formed. Through the head was chocolate, espresso coffee and and caramel. The beer poured pitch black with a dark brown head which rose slightly, held tightly, and laced the glass. The flavor was chocolate and espresso with caramel, toasted marshmallow, and more of the estery banana character. The chocolate and coffee worked very well together with the dark caramel and biscuity character. The roasted malts and bittering were well balanced with other malt and fruit and neither was overpowering working to hide the 10.8% ABV stated on the label. As the beer warmed a raisin and prune character began to emerge in both the aroma and flavor. The body was full and with a fairly low level of carbonation. The alcohol was really only a factor in the warming that occurred after consumption. A really nice RIS, banana esters when really cold, dark fruits as it warmed, great complexity. 22 ounce bottle.

Pours a deep jet black, with a dense one finger head that settles very slowly to a thick layer of foam, leaving behind a solid sheeting of lace.

Smell; dark roasted coffee mixed with bittersweet chocolate. Theres a nice presence of dark fruits, and Im also getting a little bit of anise.

Taste; the aroma of this beer is really good, but the flavor is incredible. The coffee and chocolate flavors come through much more prominently than they did in the nose. Dark fruits, such as plums and a touch of cherries, fill out the middle, and a touch of that anise and a spicy alcohol presence round out the end. Although the alcohol is noticeable, its only a little, and doesnt detract from the beer at all.

Mouthfeel is full bodied, rich and very creamy, with a very good drikability that would be higher if this were not such a thick beer.

Whenever I try a beer with the magnitude of hype that surrounds a beer such as Stones IRS, Im always a bit worried that it wont live up to it. However, with this one, I had no reason to worry. What a great beer.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

1040,"2006-12-04",4.0,"The season for Imperial Stouts is upon us, and Ive come prepared this year with an army of trained taste buds and several celebrated examples. On the heels of Storm King, Stones interpretation would serve as a comparative element in my effort to appreciate the style. The color is of true nothingness, sealed in a fugacious brown foam. The classic combination of dark chocolate and roasted coffee appears prominently on the nose, added to smooth buttery almond paste (which I adore), Amaretto, a hint of mace and clean ethanol. This rich yet simple alloy emerges as a straightforward but delicious aroma that translates well onto the palate lacking the malty bitterness that I often find detracting. Vanilla, almond, chestnut and cinnamon add to the subtle complexity of the flavor while the true hero is the velvety texture allowing these tones to shine. Finally the caliber I expected from Stone, though if I had to gripe a hint of whimsy would be appreciable.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Sure, the label (and the blurb above) talk about anise, licorice, cassis, and all that, but the sugariness and fruitiness are really subdued here. You pick them up psychosomatically after reading about them, but that intense roasty bitterness is absolutely what sets this one apart. Nothing else achieves such boldly concentrated flavors in the stout world. Theres some chocolate and coffee there, too, as with virtually RISs, but theyre just supporting partners as well.

1040,"2006-10-12",4.0,"2006 bottle tasted October 06.

Pours a viscous black, not much head. Theres a huge roasty aroma here, chocolate and coffee, a bit of agar, some alcohol. In addition to the dominant chocolate and coffee components, the flavor hits plum and black cherry, and brings in an interesting suite of flavors reminiscent of bananas flambe.The beer lacks the intoxicating sweetness of e.g. Old Rasputin, and the finish is quite strongly hopped, at this 6-month age maybe a bit overly so for my personal taste . The beer is not terribly hot, though the alcohol does come out in the flavor. 

If I hadnt come to this beer with exceptionally high expectations, I would have been very impressed. Instead, Im if anything mildly disappointed, in that I dont find this one as appealing as e.g. Old Rasputin or Speedway.

When I started to drink it, it was still a little too cold.  When too cold, you get a lot of fruit notes in it that taste more like black cherry or plums that have gone off a bit.  After letting it sit and warm up a little, I started to get more of the chocolate and coffee flavors.  There is so much going on that the alcohol content gets lost.  Stone says serve at 55 degrees, but I think thats a little low.  It needs to be pretty warm before you really get all the flavors working together nicely.  When you do, though, this is one hell of a good stout.  The funny thing is, Im pretty sure that when I drank them together, I like the 2004 better than the 2005.

Smelled of dirty Hersheys syrup, black liquorish, slight dark fruits and black roasted malts with a hint of alcohol. 

Tasted of huge bitter black chocolate with a smokiness up against my palate. Finishes with the best roasted malt character Ive ever encountered. The standard to which I here after hold all other imperial stouts. It doesnt taste like bonfire, or coffee; just smooth roasted malt (and a lot of it, I might add). Marvelous balance!

9/8/2006 6:50:17 PM: Well, here it is... My 100th review!  Ive been holding off on writing this one until I found a beer that was highly rated, but a bit unique to try to celebrate this milestone.  Today I stumbled across three bottles of the Stone Imperial Stout from Spring 2003 (9.47% alcohol) at my local liquor store.  I bought them all and have just popped one open.  Here goes...  

They werent kidding - this stuff is black.  Im shining a flashlight into it and the light is getting absorbed like a black hole.  Mild carbonation that gives rise to a dark brown hard that bubles off somewhat quickly.  Wonderful aroma of chocolate, caramel, coffee, and some alcohol.  The flavor is a wonderful melding of chocolate, licorice, roasted coffee, and some lingering aged dark fruit.  Mouthfeel is so smooth, rich, and full.  It just coats your mouth and leaves a wonderful creamy, chocolate flavor.  The alcohol flavor is still there a bit, but it is well blended with the other flavors at this point.  This beer has aged well and tastes SO good.  These bottles have been on a shelf for almost 3.5 years now, but I dont think that they will be sitting around too much longer now!

Early Summer 2004 Release
1/23/2010:  Stone Imperial Russian Stout...  Aroma:  Licorice smoke; deep, rich chocolate; heavily roasted coffee; fine brandy or cognac-like alcohol.  Appearance:  Thick, smooth, mostly tranquil pour; near black in color; opaque; some bubbles form and then quickly disappear.  Flavor:  Rich, deep, and complex; quite a bit of alcohol, but it isnt off-putting; chewy dark caramel; cola; anise; coffee; some alcoholic burn.  Palate:  Moderately thick; goes down slick.  Overall:  My wife thinks that its ""kinda tasty"" which is saying a lot coming from her; overall it is still pretty good and easily drinkable, but it seems to be on the decline.

Palate is decadent and very smooth with good carbonation. The 06 batch seems to be a bit hotter than the 05. This beer typically benefits from being aged at least a year.

Consistency is thick! thick! thick! with lots of body that coats the mouth like a thick vanilla cream.  This brew is amazingly well balanced.  It is a little intense to drink a full pint of this stuff in one sitting, but believe me you wont be able to stop.  Best stout I have tasted thus far.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","Hobbledehoy"
1040,"2006-08-11",3.5,"bomber.  Aroma:  Dark fruit, vanilla, alcohol, light coffee, molasses, and roasted grain.  Aroma was fairly intense and inviting.  Appearance:  Dark black and oily looking with a viscous pour into the snifter.  Head was small, medium tan in color, and short lived.  Almost no lacing.  Flavor:  Some sweetness up front with notes of dark fruit, anise, vanilla, and slight chocolate.  Coffee flavor comes on strong in the finish.  Lots  of alcohol flavor towards the finish, as well.  Sweetness is a little cloying and syrupy after a few sips.  Palate:  Full bodied, but was lacking a little of the  chewiness I would expect from a big Imperial Stout.  Moderate carbonation.  Lots of alcohol over entire rear of mouth.  Almost gets a little hot after a few large sips.  Overall:  A good Impy, but not a great one.

Both poured black with a quickly fading thin brown head and medium body.  This beers weakness is definitely its body, mouthfeel and head retention. 
2006: At first very little aromas, as it warmed some coffee, chocolate, and roasted aromas came out.  Flavors increased as well as the bottle warmed, coffee, chocolate, molasses, and alcohol were very carbonated on the tongue.  Overall a better than average RIS. 8/4/9/4/17  is equal to   4.2
2005:  Where as there was very light aroma for the 2006 there is an immediate intense bouquet of coffee, chocolate, anise, and roastiness.  The flavors far surpass the 2006 as strong coffee, chocolate, and alcohol flavors coat your mouth.  It almost seemed as if 2006 was a poor immitation of the 2005.  It had most of the same flavors but it was so much more intense in after one year of aging and probably a better batch to start with.   Ill be aging my 06s and hope they can reach the quality of 05.  9/4/9/4/18  is equal to  4.4.

Its overall flavor is a subdued molasses, and its texture is heavy. This is a winter beer, but Im enjoying it all the same in the pitch of summer. With a subtle warming of the mouth, and a hint of smoked toffee, I find this to be a remarkable imperial, Russian stout. For now, I put it above Old Rasputin, but Ill still need to perform a side-by-side comparison. Spring 2006 limited-edition.","Davis, California, USA","pfhyde"

1040,"2006-07-22",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 29, 2006 2005 22 Oz Bottle. This rating is a placeholder for now. I enjoyed it last night after a few beers and rather quickly. The aroma was restrained, holding back some more usually coffee dances, but displaying mature candied figs among plum alcohol. The pour was truly motor oil, with a fantastic cream and coffee head. The flavor came in three waves, which I heavily appreciate. The first was a bold blast of coffee and chocolate, but it didnt last long. It carried an interruption of alcohol. The second waves rushed forward with gentle caressing melded fruits and sensous aged grape alcohols. Vinous and delicate. Finally, the third wave carried a heavy malt whack, with some of the more typically profile, but still restrained and yearning to break free. Here heavy oak tannins and a touch of surprising sweet hops danced. The palate was exquisite. Prefectally balance alcohol, sweetness and dry smackability. Overall, damn good. I cant wait to give my 2006 a more thorough going over.
RERATE. Same score, just more elaboration. I spill a pint of heavy motor oil on the floor and so my surreptitious journey begins. A generous Lebanese man brings me a frothing pot of Turkish coffee as a I sit down to a table beside the Aegean Sea. I order a plate of Belgian chocolates, smoked Gouda and kippers. Next to me, a woman sips a cappucino kicked with Grappa. My plate arrives, with a side of heavily toasted German dark rye. I slather on some black currant preserve and a drizzle of honey. On the street, a wagon cart full of Retsina barrels make their laboured journey up the steep slope. I can whif smacks of their hewn oak. A young boy carries a bundle of wheat grain wrapped in newspaper past my table. I finish my meal, with a bite of bitter herbs, a nip of Absente and mouthful of sugar coated fennel seeds from Jaipur. I pull out my Meerschaum for a draw or two. I select a few grains of Virginia Burley. Its sugary crisp crackles and releases a white cloud of earthen delight. The day grows older. Sentient of my building soporific state, I return to my apartment above the sausage shop and lie for a slumber, with the salty breeze blowing past the freshly washed curtains. An all around delight.

This Imperial Stout is an exemplary model for the style, but not unique or particularly creative in my opinion. Its almost an old standard. Heavy coffees, heavy roast, some mingling fruit and spice. Fairly predictable. But this isnt to detract from its overall enjoyability or quality. A beer to share and celebrate over a winter repast.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

I finally decided it was most like a soy sauce type smell. The flavor was intense and heavy. The mouthfeel was the best part--absolutely the best Ive ever experienced. The taste was so complex too.

1040,"2006-06-24",4.7,"Pours like thick, black ooze.  Insanely opaque, to the point where I held my LED headlamp up to it and no light could escape.  Nose gives strong espresso and bakers chocolate, mixed with a hint of chicory and dark cherry.  On the palate, it is velvety, with an undeniable presence I would hesitate to describe as heavy; rather, the Imperial Stout is simply THERE, inescapable, not begging for attention but commanding it.  It is emininetly drinkable, with each successive quaff bringing more of the disparate but well-melded flavors to the fore.  The alcohol builds in small crescendos with each sip, warming, but not burning, mixing with the malts for a finish that lets you know you darn well better take another sip.  The hop character, so recognizable as Stones, is present, floating on top of the other flavors.  Its almost too much right now, but I have a few bottles in the cellar, and Id expect the chocolate and espresso to blend, the chicory to soften, and the alcohol bite to smooth out a bit over time.

Very, Very dark, Chocolate dark, Dark as night dark. Very nice head to it and it stays till the end. Flavor is good at first, but gets good with each sip. Honestly this beer really did get better with every sip. It is very drinkable and makes your mouth tell your hand to keep on grabbing the snifter to feed it to it.

Very thin brown tan head that settles near the rim of the glass very quietly and beautifully.  Heavy aroma of coffee, alcohol, dark malt, hints of chocolate, and a tiny bit of spices (not sure which).  Flavor notes are also chocolate, molasses, a touch of coffee, and dark, dark roasted malt.  Extremely bold and thick flavor bringing out rich alcohol flavor that sizzles on the tongue with spices as it goes down in a very mysterious manner.

1040,"2006-06-03",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 9, 2009 Revised after 2009 vintage: Acquired by dad, shared with him in Aug 2009. Cocoa and milk chocolate elements were at the fore, and this was an excellent experience. Glad weve got two years now in a row with a higher quality after a couple off batches. Could have featured more hops, though. Revised after 2008 vintage: Back on track, darned nice brew. Excellent stuff. Revised after 2007 release: Unimpressive again, decent for sure, but not at the top of the style. See otehr vintage notes from 2006. 2006 Release: Nice initial tan head. Not as hoppy as I recall the 2005, somewhat of a decrease in quality, imo. Somewhat astringent, vinous flavor, the increased alcohol is noticeable. The flavor is accompanied this year by some oak, charred nuts, and both light and dark fruits (peaches?). After about 50-55F, I noticed some sort of a spice, cinnamon-like quality. No idea where that was coming from, but it was more than one sip. Again, this needed more hops and fell short in quality of the 2005 version Ive had before. 2005 Release: Ok, the appearance was great. Nice pitch black color with a head that was nice and chocolate-like (brown). Lacing was great and the aroma was sweet chocolate with only a light roasting. Hops detectable in the aroma and they come out and get you in the finish. The base flavor is sweet chocolate with a midly bitter mid flavor. At first I didnt like the hops in my stout at these levels, but as the beer warmed, it became more balanced and the stout flavors and alcohol mellowed the hops. I liked this, but outside of the appearance didnt find it to be more extraordinary than many a good stout out there. Re-rate, April 06, vintages 03-06 in a horizontal, falling just behind Speedway and The Abyss, yet ahead of 3F DL. The 03 version was more choco-cocoa tasting, 04 having more of a choco-brandy taste, and the 05 choco, cocoa, dark fruits, and piney hops. 1-2 years of aging might be optimal for this beer.","","User37895"

Dark fruits, coffee and a bit of bakers dark chocolate pull through well, but I noticed a bit of an undesirable bitterness that I didnt care for too much,   not exactly a hop like bitterness, more of a harsh astringent bitterness. The head didnt last long at all, but at nearly 10% you cant really expect that. This is a thick brew, which is really good given the style.

1040,"2006-05-29",3.8,"22 oz bomber of the 2006 vintage. I remember this beer being much bolder in the past. I still enjoyed it, but I had this one and a Viking Big Swede, and was suprised at how much more impressive Big Swede was when I did a side by side tasting of the two. That being said, this beer is still excellent, and an Impy well worth trying. Stone Russian Imperial pours to a jet black color, with a thick, creamy, white head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is fragrant with aromas of dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, and hints of cracked black pepper. The palate is firm, with good dark chocolate, roast, and coffee flavors, paired with hints of licorice. This beer finishes with more big dark chocolate and coffee, then ends with a light, warming burn. Good Imperial, but Ive have enjoyed other example much better than this one. When I did my Impy tasting recently, I found Viking Brewings Big Swede more impressive than Stone Russian Imperial.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

Big roasted malty taste, chocolate, fruity and caramelized, roasted grainy, a subtle alcohol warmth, the ABV level is well masked, the alcohol warmth starts in the middle and then lasts through out, a little biting spiciness and a sweet roasty and fruity finish.

Rich and thick on the palate, this is quickly making me forget the wicked burn I got on my hand today. A roasty bitterness on the finish, and a gentle warming to go with it. What a great beer.

The nose is heavy on the roasted malts, suggestive of hazelnut coffee, but also with a bit of indistinguishable fruit behind it. The flavor characteristics are incredibly complex but well balanced at the same time.

On the other hand, the alcohol was way too overpowering which made it difficult to enjoy these subtle smells.  All of these subtle aromas are present in the flavour, though, and although the alcohol is definitely present, its not the dominant component of the flavor.  The palate is really enjoyable- its thick, smooth and creamy (rich, full, etc...)!  A sweet and roasty flavour lingers on the palate- for a very long time.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","tcruicks"
1040,"2006-05-12",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 13, 2006 2006 bottle.  Pours blacker than brown and browner than black, quite nearly impenetrable.  A thin  dark tan head, though I never hold that against this style.  This one is a strong son of a gun, alcohol is immediately obvious, but so is the creamy rich malt.  For me to smell the richness of a beer is something unusual, so this is sure to be a treat.  An obvious bit of roast with some fruit in there.  There also appears to be some vanilla and cinnamon at warmer temperatures.  Velvety smooth and creamy, not quite as viscous as I had hoped, but I sure wont complain!  The CO2 level is about as perfect as imaginable, reminding me of Fullers London porter.  This really dazzles on the taste buds.  Not as bold and brash as most Stone brews, this beer really shows they can be subtle when appropriate.  Ridiculously sweet and malty, creamy with definite presence of vanilla and anise and almost lactic.  Theres a slight amount of roast, but somehow, it isnt star of the show, which seems unusual for an impy stout.  This plays off a lot more like a barleywine.  Theres a slight tough of floral hops in there, but its impact on the flavor pales in comparison to the intensity of the alcohol.  The warming sensation is really pleasant, making this a sipper.  the roast really doesnt make itself apparent until the aftertaste, which is subtle and not at all overbearing.  Being a sucker for sweet malty beers, I really love this brew which someone avoids being cloying.  The other flavors are really subtle, but still seem to contribute to the flavor profile.  With this much alcohol, Id imagine this will age for quite some time, and I look forward to drinking my other bottles as the alcohol mellows out.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

I just love staring at the black hole sun that only seems to radiate out of RIStouts.  Great creamy mocha head looked like a fine Italian espresso.
It even smelled like a good coffee, with some sprinkles of lake champlain Tanzanian dark chocolate.  Piney hop effluves slowly creeped up and alcohol in the finale was and soothing.
Surprisingly smooth at first, the hop astringency gradually comes along in the end, making a kind of wave thats creamy, then just a bit sweet, then bitter and warm from the alcohol.  I wouldnt drink tons of this stuff, but when I have a feel for a RIS I wouldnt mind having some of this.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"

The hops are anything but arrogant though they balance things slightly. I also get some chocolate covered banana on the nose. A nice imp stout but it is not as good as the Oaked Yeti or Expedition. Age may improve but wont change the fundamental characteristics of it. Bottom line- I like more IBUs in my imp stouts.","Mt Kisco, New York, USA","Brewso"

Motor oil is not black, in fact it is more like copper and only goes black after 5000 miles of use in the car.  Please refer to the colour or look of these beers as used motor oil.

The nose is alcohol and roasted nuts, with some toast and sweetness, and a note of prunes/raisins. Could be a little more assertive. Flavor starts out with massive alcohol, prunes, dark toast. Short coffee finish with lingering roasted bitterness. The alcohol is a bit too strong in the flavor. Some nutty character and (yes) anise appearing later in the glass.

1040,"2006-04-24",4.1,"From Bottle, 2006 Vintage.  Pours of pitch black molasses with a churning froth of head that looks like sugar scum scraped off of a stovetop caramel sauce.  The head quickly disappears, leaving behind a black hole impenetrable by light.  Waves of anise immediately waft to my nostrils, mixing brilliantly with some supple dark chocolates to create a chocolate black licorice sensation.  Some dark, juicy prune and Irish creme notes are in there as well.  Hmmm... the bouquet is pleasant, but not as complex as I expected and is rather a let down after drooling over the appearance in my snifter glass.  The initial palate feel is really where this beer gets its chance to shine, and a standout category where I feel it is totally worthy of my 5 rating.  At first, the texture is so rich and thick, its almost as though Im drinking some silky Belgian chocolate straight out of a fondue pot.  Rolling this amorphous matter over my tongue brings back fond memories of Brazil, a beach, and a bottle of absinthe.  Definitely some molasses notes as well.  Final smack of an oaky bourbon and a cigar dipped in molasses.  Overall, Im not quite sure how I feel about this beer.  Im blown away by the appearance and richness of the texture, but the bouquet and flavor isnt that much better than many of its competitors in this style.  I will look forward to aging my remaining stash for awhile to see if that will further improves my impressions.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Tangy and golden-raisin sweet in the middle, with a refreshing bitter finish that harbors a bit of banana flavor.

1040,"2006-03-30",4.9,"From the limited 2004 release, this is one beer Id really been looking forward to.

Pours like motor oil. Thick, black, viscous. Really had to tease a head out of it near the end with the pour, but man, what a head. Dark brown, thick, opaque, and lasting. About 1/2"" thick, and just takes forever to fade, leaving *sheets* of foam on the sides. As I drank it down, I could just sit and stare at the blanketing lacing that just smothers the sides.

Smells like thick, syrupy dark malts, toasted nuts and raisins. Hints of chocolate, roasted coffee, and cinnamon. Very thick, very subtle. Definitely looking forward to drinking it.

This is by far the best tasting stout Ive ever had, better even than Poseidon or Storm King. Every last bit of it is silky smooth, and complex. Coffee, chocolate, and cherries up front, pushing on to bananas, more chocolate and cherries, and grapefruits, with a wash of oranges and cherries. The cherries flavor carries through the entire experience, just cruising along in the background, helping to accent the roasted and richer flavors. The hops are certainly not dead after 18 months of cellaring, and almost add an edge to this beer at the end.

Mouthfeel is silky smooth throughout, and massive all the way. It just ripples along the tongue.

This beer does leave a bit of a bitter aftertaste in your mouth. While that certainly leaves you ready for more, it builds in the throat a bit, and Id imagine if you were heart-burn or reflux prone, this beer would be serious trouble. Its hard to resist though...oh so hard.

In the end, this beer is everything Id hoped it would be, and thats saying a lot. The 2005 RIS was the best beer Id had, nearly, and I fully expected the cellared 2004 to raise the bar again.","Bainbridge Island, Washington, USA","waldowin"

For the life of me, I dont know why so many beer aficiandos find this to be a pleasing feature of many imperial stouts, but I most certainly do not.

No offense to the Russians, but what were looking at here is labeled as Stone Imperial Stout in a 22 oz. ""bomber.""  ABV is listed on the bottle as a whopping 10.8%!  The bottle bears the legend Limited Early Summer 2005 Release.  No sign of this particular brand on the Stone roster, so I assume this is where it should be rated?  Well, now that weve cleared that up . . . 

""Motor oil"" indeed. Try as I might, I couldnt get any incandescent light  to shine through my full glass!  A remarkably heady aroma of chocolate, coffee and ripe dark fruit pulls no punches as to what awaits the taste buds.  Extremely powerful without being too overwhelming, there is also -- not unexpectedly -- a strong alcohol presence.  This stout is a monster -- as full-bodied as anything Ive tried -- and definitely not for the faint of heart.

In summary, this is a first-rate concoction from a first-rate brewery.  However, the elephantine nature of this beast makes it best held to only one or two encounters per year.","Waterville, New York, USA","MarkBarnes"

1040,"2006-01-18",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 3, 2009 bottle. Pours like motor oil and leaves a ridiculously dark brown head. The inviting aroma is so strong that I can smell it before I take a whiff up close. This stuff smells damn good. Theres plenty of chocolate and coffee of course, but also there is plenty of sweet wood which reminds me of a good scotch. The flavor is wonderfully complex and very assertive. Plenty of mlik chocolate, more woody notes with a very earthy foundation. Theres a little nut flavor as well, perhaps in the vein of pecans. The alcohol (10.8% for the 05) is not even detectable unless under the harshest scrutiny. Some faint, distant hops make themselves known in the finish. I was expecting something more ridiculous from Stone, but this is just sensibly complex and damn savory.

 Bottle of the 2007 stuff. Pours black with a firm dark tan head. Very nice lacing. This is definitely a good looking beer. Man, this stuff smells so good. Savory, rich roasty espresso, earth, mocha, hickory, a bit of pine are all noted. Palate is thick and chewy. I love this beer. This time around I drank a fresher bottle, but truth to tell, its not a whole lot different than my first experience. Id say there are more bitter notes present now, and the heavy body doesnt seem quite as syrupy, but this beer definitely can hold up with some age on it. There is a very nice chocolate presence that comes out in the finish along with a smoky, nutty flavor that dries the palate a little. Obviously, as this bad boy warms it gets even more delicious. The alcoholic qualities fade away completely and more density is felt. This is truly a top notch imperial stout. I was a little afraid that revisiting this one after Ive tasted so many others in the style since, I would appreciate it less. But no, it is delectable.

1040,"2006-01-18",4.4,"Bottle. Pours black with a tinge of amber only on the extreme edges and a thin dark tan head. The aroma is very, very malty. Lots of raisin, wood, some chocolate, just a faint hint of espresso, and Scotch whisky. The flavor: wow, where to start. It evolves as it moves across the palate. Initially it is quite sweet, like raisins and maple. It moves on toward the more intense grainy malts. Lots of barley, oak, pot ash, earth, and peat. Toward the finish the hops finally come out, though not as obnoxiously as in other Stone offerings. They are fairly mellow, but quite earthy and blend well with the rest of the flavors. There is really no indication at all of the high alcohol. The mouthfeel is really quite thick, but not sticky. This is some excellent stuff. Yum yum.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

Good lacing, a tan color on the glass in intricate patterns.  Drinks a thick chocolatey taste, even a little refreshingly so.  Malts are present and so is deliciousness.  By far better than some other Stones, and that says a lot, because Stone seems to sit near the top of the pack.

This is has just about everthing I love about imperial stouts:
1. motor oil pour with a midnight black opaque color and a nice tan head.
2. flavors of chocolate, roasted malts, and the slight bitterness of coffee that warm you up on chilly days...Im sure the alcohol content has something to do with that ""warming up"" factor to, but anyways... 
3. smooth complexity, alittle bite on the tounge and then a smooth finish
The one thing that wasnt too familar was the slight hoppy tone in the beginning of each sip and in the aftertaste. Pretty interesting, but not suprising as I have found Stone loves giving us that hoppy flavor. All in all a very delicous imperial stout.

2006 spring release. Came across this llittle beauty today and picked up three bombers. The new label is kinda neat, the hat is a nice touch. The beer seems fairly similar, the aroma is kind of roasty and a bit soapy. The flavor is full of chocolate,  roasted malt, coffee all the great comfort flavors youd expect from the style. The mouthfeel is also very nice, rich and chewy...never too clumpy.  Still a great beer and definetly benifits with some age.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"

Jesus. They really didnt fuck around with this one, did they? Pours black as the darkest of nights, like the deepest corner of hell during a power outage. Smells like alcohol, molasses, a hint of black licorice, alcohol, maybe some brown sugar, then more alcohol. 

Mouthfeel is not all that viscous, not too surprising given the amount of alcohol, but the flavors erupt on the taste buds, black coffee, brown sugar, molasses, and of course the alcohol is right up front, all around and dominates the finish. Very similar to the North Coast Old Stock I had a month or two ago. This was obviously intended to be aged at least a year but, this being my first go at this one, I couldnt bring myself to wait. Big mistake: after a couple of normal strength beers and a dopplebock this one really fucked me up but good. I think I ended up consuming three meals the next day before my stomach even started to cooperate with me, and the rest of my senses were similarly out of whack. I cant believe this shit is only available in bombers. The only real knock I have against this thing, actually. You really need someone to share this with unless its going to be your only beer of the day. I imagine this would rate at least a 4.5 if not a 5 on taste given a little aging, but I have to grade based on what Ive got in front of me, and fresh off the truck theres just a bit too much alcohol drowning out the other tastes.","Austin, Texas, USA","julrey"

Wonderfully smooth, rich and creamy.  More coffee, dark chocolate, and licorice punctuated by notes of peppery spice and citrus. Pleasant dry finish, not overly bitter or astringent.

1040,"2005-11-27",3.9,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2007 Oof, this was a knock in the mouth for sure.  I had a room full of people looking into their glass of Stone Imperial Stout with aplomb, then discomfort, then outright terror.  Even I, their experienced beer guide, had a hard time not making faces every time I took a swig.  Everything I expected from Stone Brewery - a confident group of skilled brewers who make some muscled beers and arent afraid to say it  was absolutely true and painfully verified.  The burly demon on the front of their bottles should portend the imminent destruction of your oral cavity.  Warning!  Will make you cry for your Mommas Mommas Momma.  When I poured the beer a friend of mine said it looked like Worchester sauce.  Another one shook her mug and remarked on the saturnine quality of the beer.  Its rough stuff.  The head is a beautiful dark brown straight from a sooty old London library.  To describe the color of the beer itself would be an impossibility verging on blasphemy.  Its not a color; its a lack of color, a deep, inky morass that veils the toothsome goodness inside.    From that swampy darkness comes a gaseous concoction of dark chocolate, peanuts, straight coco, coffee with milk and even some butter.  I looked like Intensive Care patient with an oxygen mask the way I was holding the mug to my nose.  Breathe deep, breathe out, breathe deep, and relax.  Eventually the aroma will draw you in to the tortuous taste, where one finds a prelude of coco, followed by a long astringent twang of coffee and salt.  Also present is a salty quality (not sweet n salty like other stouts Ive had) and a good deal of licorice.  The stout is fairly smooth, but thinner than others of its kind.  If youre longing for a brutal beer after a mellow repast, pick up a bottle of this heathenistic brew and expect to be get your teeth kicked in. 

Second review on 12/12/06: Head is like cooling magma, body is still a the color of deep space.  Smell has chocolate with a bit of funkiness, lots of malts and barbeque sauce.  Taste is apple, orange laden with thick malts and hops and very oily like petroleum politics.  Enough carbonation to inflate a life raft.  Too much alcohol, too little other stuff.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Hops are definately in the background with this one.  Rich full bodied beer with an oily texture.  Soft carbonation breathes a little live into the mouthfeel as well.  This beer has everything you want in an imperial stout if you favor the malty ones over highly hopped versions.  Big bold flavor without any harsh alcohol save for the pleasant warming finish.

Wonderfully integrated aroma; a fine textured roastiness, like a freshly pulled shot of espresso. Toffee and rum seemlessly blend with the roast. A surprising amount of buttery character, but it feels intentional, like a nod to the stouts of Samuel Smith. Smooth and firm, but surprisingly gentle dark chocolate flavors, with a little coffee, a bit of dark pit fruit. Big and mouthfilling, but not harsh. All in all rather understated for such a big beer. Not to say it isnt full flavored--it just seems to do an unsually good job of balancing all the flavor contributions. This was an 05 bottle, but it tastes like it has already been well-aged.

Rich enough and smooth almost like a milkshake going down the hatch. Roasted malts and the alcohol were almost just to good to decribe here.

After a while of drinking, Im starting to come around, but I shouldnt have to come around on a top 10 beer.  I think its somewhat astringant.  Hard to drink.

The complexity of the nose is unparalleled - bakers chocolate is layered upon tons of roasted malt with underlying notes of vanilla, smoke and tobacco.  A mild hint of the alcohol is present as well.  The body is softly carbonated, but not as velvety as I would have expected, although that may come with age.  More bittersweet chocolate and roastiness dominate the body and cling to the tongue for longevity.  The finish is dry and roasty, almost to the point of puckering.

Just as frigging good as the 2001. Same tasting notes as below, alcohol shows a tad more but who cares. Let this bad boy warm up and your in imperial heaven, this is it for me, my all time favorite, 4 years ago I should have given it a perfect 5, well now its got it. Intense, boozy, full of aroma and flavor, rich and easy to drink for its size. The Imperial that sets the standard IMHO. Fantastic and as I said before, this is better then porno. Bravo Stone. 


(Spring 2001 tasting notes)
Oh man. 100% black and opaque. Has some deep but slight ruby edges.Tan head dies quick. The nose..let me stress..as soon as I popped the cap the aroma hit me like a tyson overhand right. Burnt dark fruits(plums,raisons,currants)Burnt caramel, with notes of anise,cocoa and coffee. Best damn Imperial aroma ever. Thick and silky smooth in mouth. Intense flavors hit you hard. Raisons ,plums, sweet malt, roasted coffee ,cocoa ,anise and alcohol. All these flavors and it maintains a mellowness that I never had in an Imperial of this size. Masterful brewing. Flavor sticks forever but thats a good thing, I dont want it going anywhere. This is better then porno ladies and gentleman. Just enough hops to add another page to this magnificient story of a beer.

1040,"2005-07-15",3.6,"(draft) First off, looks fantastic. black with a firm brown head, I was almost reluctant to drink it for fear of messing up the head. Flavor is a nice chocolate, with just a hint of bitterness about halfway through. I was a little surprised, and a little disappointed, that the ABV is so high on this one. Id love to be able to have more than one.","Georgetown, Indiana, USA","barenada"

Smells like you would expect: roasty, coffee, fruit, a bit of malt, anise, and a bit of hop presence. The flavor is similar. Not too sweet or cloying, very well balanced. The abv is warming, but not overwhelming by any means. The mouthfeel of this beer is creamy with small bubbles, fluffy bubbliness when swished. This beer rules.

1040,"2005-07-13",4.2,"2004 bottle, for those who give a damn, courtesy of tpkenned.  Decent thick pour and mostly opaque with some translucency around the edges when put to light.  Midnight brown in color with a few isolated bubble islands for the head, but overall its fairly desolate.  One heck of a nose - heavy roasted malts, black cherries burnt to the pit, dark chocolate and Starbucks espresso.  Flavor unfolds with a decadent dance of dark chocolate and French roasted coffee.  Vinous and melding, with a thick, chew-on-this attitude.  Some nuances of flame licked pecans and ABV accents from time to time.  Good Lord, good palate, like hot wax slowly seeping in from the snifter.  Full-bodied and a big boy.  Finish is espresso-laden with an uncanny warming overlay.  Smooth, balanced and mellower than I imagined, but damn enjoyable.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

A very,very black beer in the glass..e veritable black-hole of an ale, small purple/tan head goes fast leaving minimal lace.
fantastically robust aroma of many things among them aniseed, liquorice,dark roasted coffee beans, dark fruits, prunes and a kick of alcohol.Tremendous.
Tset starts of smooth then tumbles into an enjoyable roughness were the malts dominate and dark coffee is the taste,some very noticable alcoholic flavours in the end, lingering liquorice bitter sweet tastes.

There is absolutely no sign of light getting through this one even when you hold it up to a bulb.  Aroma is of coffee, chocolate, plums, and a touch of molasses.  Flavor is quite complex as well.  Bitter roasted coffee, chocolate, a touch of smoke, and even a bit of vanilla can be found as this one is sipped.  On the palate this is beautifully smooth and creamy.   Thick and chewy in the mouth.  It coats the inside of your mouth with its black creamy body.  Alcohol is just present enough to let you know that this one needs to be sipped and not gulped.

Bomber of 04.  Pours obsidian black, no light can get through.  Head is dark brown and lasts and leaves considerable lacing.  Aroma is very Stone-ish.  Big on rich and fragrant base malt and caramel sweetness....all to complement that massive roasted malt and chocolate presence with coffee in the background.  No hops nor alcohol in the nose.  Flavor is rich and chocolately with caramel sweetness and lingering hop bitterness to complement.  Some fruity esters and espresso are in the taste as well.  Body is thick and rich and smooth as could be with just enough carbonation.  Great beer.  Just behind Dark Lord and a bit ahead of Speedway.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","BlueDevil0206"
1040,"2005-06-28",4.5,"Summer 2004 Bomber.  Poured just as a beer should... jet black with a healthy caramel head.  The room got a little darker when I poured this beast, so I think it may have been absorbing a little extra light.  Coffee, hazelnut, chocolate, roasted malts, and anise were noticable in the aroma.  It really blossomed as it warmed up.  Coffee and chocolate roastiness first hit the palate.  That was complemented by a nice subtle hoppy bite (powerfully weak by Stone standards, but perfectly balanced for this style).  Coated the mouth very well, and was smooth as silk.  Roasted coffee and a little hoppy bitterness provided a wonderful long finish.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1040,"2005-06-27",4.8,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2005 This does in fact look like very dirty car oil.  Nonetheless, this is a very solid stout, somewhat crisp.  The best part about this beer is that it tastes as if it has just a normal (4-5%) alcohol content, not the killer 11% that it does. Excellent.

Re-rate: Apparantly, this one isnt separated by year. That said, this is my 2004 version rating: 10,4,10,5,18 or 4.7! Truly a great beer, with anise clearly in the aroma - glad to see the description verifies it. Fantastic stout.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"

I wanted to try a bunch of beers today, so I gave a small sample to a random beer connoisseur at the bar.  I think I opened his eyes to big stouts.

But it was much smaller (almost non-existant) than I had expected from a stout, and left no lacing to speak of.  The first aroma that hit me was Black Licorice then some roasted coffee.  The coffee is intensified and joined by some roastiness and chocolate in the flavor.

Roasted coffee notes on the nose, a touch subtle for the style. Palate weight is not heavy and again feels  a touch light for the style. Shows excellent balance of roasted malt, chocolate and alcohol sweetness. Good finish with length and some bitterness. Not as thick or formidable as the spin on the back label would have you believe (but the beer is all the better for it).

1040,"2005-05-10",4.2,"(22 oz bottle: $3.99 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) This is the 2004 bottling, aged in my dark, air-conditioned beer cellar (i.e., my bedroom) for over a year.  This is perhaps the most purely malty Imperial Stout I can remember tasting, the maltiness actually beats out the roastiness in an arm wrestling match.  Chocolate is a major contributor as well.  It’s also very sweet, sugary sweet actually, and I think a bit too sugary.  Perhaps aging this beer isn’t the best thing as the hops still has presence, but the beer almost seems out of balance at this point.  Full bodied, sticky, somewhat syrupy mouthfeel.  Intensely sweet, malty and chocolaty, smells like it’s the final course (i.e., dessert).  Fairly alcoholic nose as well.  The beer is an extremely dark brown, but not quite black, and fully opaque.  Dark tan head is fairly small and fades away to almost nothing, but I’ve seen much better head size and retention with this beer during previous sessions.  At some point in the future, I’ll rerate this beer with a fresh bottle to do a direct comparison with an aged bottle.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Flavor of toffee, chocolate covered cherries, some licorice, some other dark fruits thrown in, and surprisingly, the coffee was in the background.  There was some slight hops bitterness, but again, in the background.  As it warmed it became a little sweet, maybe a little too sweet (there I go, looking for the faults) with the chocolate and toffee.  Throughout the entire glass, it has a slight alcohol bite (slight, considering the 10.8%).  It finishes sweet and with a little tingle at the back of the throat from the alcohol.

When the beers heads to the back of the mouth, a bitterness is revealed along with a burst of citrus rind and dark berry flavors , the sweetness that was apparent in the first part of the sip gets mopped up quickly by the hops bitterness, but in the end the hops, nor the malt dominate, just the nice flavors.  The finish is bitter, but also flavorful and sweet? initially, then moves into an equilibrium and just a lingering nice taste. The mouthfeel is very good, it seems to coat the mouth, but it is closer to a 4/5  than a 5/5, but really closer yet to a 4.5/5.  The beer is now at 54.5° and I now get hints of the alcohol. A slight warming sensation points to the near 10% ABV. This is a very, very good beer.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Flavor is strong, malty, roasty, coffee and alcohol.  My one ding on this bee is that it tended to be cloyingly sweet to me and I downgraded it as a result.  Good palate and servicable.

It is just a good looking beer...that is very inticing.  THe aroma intensifies and increases in complexity as it warms.  I smell and tasted an exotic terryaki flavor.  It had darker fruits, roasted coffee, a slight spice, and maltiness to its flavor.  There was a pleasant alcoholic warming effect as it is swallowed.  It had a sticky sweetness that had to be handled at a slow sipping pace.  The palate was like a heavy velvet blanket.

1040,"2005-01-29",4.8,"UPDATED: JUN 27, 2005 Re-rating: 4.8  2004 late summer bomber.  Poured as a third contender in the imperial stout off yesterday.  This guy was up against Speedway and Dark Lord and held its own amazingly well for such a reasonably priced beer.  Pour is opaque black with a dark tan head.  The first rating was right -- this looks like old motor oil.  Aroma is wonderfully complex with a great roastiness and a more apparent hops profile than either Speedway or DL.  Flavor is intiall nice and sweet.  Deliciously chocolaty and thick.  Dried fruits start coming out once the roastiness subsides.  The hops are more notable in the finish than throughout, and balance this sweet nectar very well.  I guess its kind of unfair that we gave this beer an extra year of aging that Speedway and DL didnt get, but it is absolutely on par.  Mouthfeel is somewhere between Speedway and DL, in the range of whole milk or half and half.  The carbonation is very light.  My only reason for docking it is that it doesnt have quite the complexity of flavor that DL does.  For 1/2 to 1/3 the price of the other two beers, this one is where it should be.  Awesome beer.

First rating (very early in my beer career): 4.3  2004 late summer bomber.  Very sweet, understated smell.  Pours black as can be -- looks like an overdue oil change.  Very little, thin, tan head.  Thinner mouthfeel than I expected.  Not very carbonated.  Tastes very roasty, notes of coffee, very bitter chocolate, hops.  Amazing beer.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Jonathan3584"

Black as midnight with a thick dark dark brown head.  Aroma of dark fruit, figs, dates, coffee, malted milk, cherry and a big blast of roasted grain.  As the temperature rises, a hint of beech smoke become obvious as well.  Flavour is very good, sweet dark fruits up front, especially dates and black cherries.  Lots of coffee and heavy roastiness in the finish.  There is a touch of saltiness here as well.  Body is thick and creamy.  Long warming finish.

The first aroma impressions are chocolate, lots of it, a fruitiness that I would describe as dark cherries, and coffee. The first sips reveal a melange of chocolate and coffee that reminds of choco-moccacino. Behind that lies roastmaltiness, sweetness and fruity flavours like blackcurrant and dark cherries. Ends alcoholic (of the vineous variety) and leaves a bitter-chocolate aftertaste. Very full-bodied with a creamy-thick texture. I really loved this beer.

1040,"2004-12-02",4.6,"22oz bomb from the 2004 batch. As I was pouring this I was reminded that my car needs an oil change. Wow this is thick stuff, and about as dark and opaque as a beer can get. An excellent dark tan/brown head arose from the snifter as this was poured and stuck around for a bit before leaving a lace as is dropped to a bubbly ring around the beer. First smells that hit me were the bittersweet dark chocolate and the roasted coffee. After that notes of fruits and a touch of alcohol could be found. The taste begins with a bit of sweetness followed by the chocolate and roasted coffee. You get hit with the alcohol around the middle of the taste but not in a negative way and some fruity flavors as well. A nice bitter finish and this one lingers around a bit in your mouth well after you drink it. Mouthfeel is HUGE, a small sip seems to fill the mouth and it is so rich and creamy feeling. This goes down extremely easy for the alcohol and overall hugeness of the brew.

1040,"2004-11-26",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 13, 2006 2006 Vintage. Rated July 2006. Black body with a small quickly fading chocolate coloured head (3+).  Muted oily roast and a sweetness accented by traces of nut and molasses undertones, particularly as it warms up. Sweet dark malt middle is sweet with extremely muted roasts, and an oily quality. Medium oily palate is lacking a bit of something to take it up a notch (3+). Very nice, but I think it suffers compared to my memory of it and direct comparisons with other beers on this night. 7/3+/7/3+/14-16 - 3.6<P>
2004 Vintage.  Rated Nov-25-04 Black body, a vigourous pour yields a nice chocolate coloured head but can persuade it to stay. (3+) Muted roast, touch of coffee over some notes of alcohol and some dark chocolate. Would rate the aroma higher still if the alcohol was better concealed - that said at 10% its not as in your face as it could be. Flavour has an underlying sour acidity. Surprisingly well balanced with the hops providing a pleasant bitterness that shows up most prominantly in the finish. I found the roast to be very restrained, which I like. Palate is full bodied without being syrupy. Excellent. Thanks again for sharing this one Gunny.

Vertical on Christmas day of 2004-2006.  General comments: Overall I will change my score by one point on aroma, as I think this was low to begin with.  However, I will stick with everything else.  With regard to the tasting the 2005 was the winner across the board.  It had the best balance of smoothness and flavor left to it.  The 2004 was very gentle.  Soft on the palet with very subdued flavors, but it was still better than the 2006.  The 2006 had a much lighter color than either of the previous years and just did not have the flavor profile of either the 2004 or 2005.  A fact I found to be most interesting.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

Good stuff, but do not drink when green. Old rating follows. Pours the expected black colored body with a darker brown color. The aroma is great with bourbon, vanilla and chocolate covered raisins. The taste is hard to take with lots of malt and alcohol burn. There are also notes of dark chocolate and some walnuts. The bitterness is somewhat anise. It reminds me of trying to eat salted peanut shells. I thought the body was a little thin for an impy stout. I could not get past the bitterness. I would like to try one these again after it has been aged for a couple years.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

Did I say big?  Yes, its a bit hot right now, but the layers of flavor just ooze out as this beauty warms.  Is this brewed with Hersheys chocolate syrup?  Thick, a bit sweet (for now), and alcohol kick in the finish.  Overall a super brew that will just get better with cellaring.","Eastampton, New Jersey, USA","Cornboy"

Oh my dear god, this is a black thick brew. it is like a black hole, no light escapes. fat dark brown head that sticks around and laces menacingly.hot chocolate and a roasted aroma escape from my snifte, very inviting. taste is wonderful, at first it is sweet chocolate and bitter, then it slides to an alcohol bite that leaves a great dry roast chocolate flavor. hops are apparent throughout this. notes od caramel and roast coffee come out later in this one. this is the thickest Imp I have had the pleasure to experience. This is the embodiement of what i love in an Imp, and i loves me some Imps.  this is so much better as it warms. there are complexities that emerge that are fantastic. peppery at one point, almost an orange flavor the next.  so chewy, so good.","Montana, USA","Kevin"

OK again BLACK! Truly [again as pretty much expected]  One of the darkest head Ive remember seeing.  Doesnt last long, and no lace, but that seems pretty typical (?) This is so good!

Pours virtually black with a tan head about an inch thick and pretty good retention.  Nice lacing.  Rather sweet and matly with chocolate flavors.  Obvious coffee is balanced well with the malts .  Has a nutty taste to it as well.  Alcohol is noticeable, but for the most part blends together rather nice with the other flavors.  Slightly hoppy moderately sweet in the finish and you get a tinge of alcohol burn.  Aftertaste is a little sweet and a little coffee and licorice.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

Like high-ocate Sam Smiths Imperial.  I was pleasantly surprised by the soft finish despite lotsa alcohol.  Some coffee on the aroma, though not strong or overpowering.  Flavor seemed to get better as it reached room temp.  (Harder to rate objectively the drunker one gets.)  Strangely, no head on this one.  Before tabulating the official score, Id put this around 4.3 out of 5.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"

1040,"2004-09-20",3.9,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2004 Poured jet black with a small dark brown head.  Aroma was not as strong as I would have expected, and smelled of some coffee notes and a slight alcoholic character.  Initial taste was slightly sweet with some roastedness.  A definitive malt character was present throughout the mouthful.  It ended with a moderate bitterness.  Overall, despite the hype, I was not extremely impressed by this brew.  However, I dont think my experience with it was situationally ideal, for 1) I served it too cold (although it did warm up and I did notice that it got more pleasant as it warmed), and 2) I ended having to drink the whole bottle by myself, and I felt rather ill towards the end.  If I get my hands on another bottle, I will rerate it under better conditions at a future time.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

Alcohol is nicely covered but still gives you that warming feeling which is very pleasant because it is so subtle; the alcohol seems more in the 7% range.  Smooth, heavy, the flavor isnt as complex as the aroma would make you think, coffee and malt are the main tastes.  A darn good I.S.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Enniskillen"
1040,"2004-09-05",4.9,"Color is as black as sin, thoroughly opaque, utterly dark, and well-endowed with a full, thick, lush roasty-toasty tan head.
Aroma: Oh, goodness, gracious, golly! Sweetness, rich, lush, chocolatey, and burgeoning with a myriad of further flavors, dates, raisins, anise, molasses, maple syrup, dark, twisted, delicious...Ive compared certain other Imperial Stouts to candy bars (Bells Expedition, to name one, whose glass I drink this from), and this goes a touch beyond that, without testing the boundaries of sweetness. Magnificent.
Taste: No body could be fuller, no taste could be richer, the malt is thick and juicy, even, and the hops keep the tongue busy and happy. A complex melange, a viscous mouthfeel, constant tussel with the palate, insistent pleasure on the tongue. 
Now, the thicker, slicker, motor-oliy feel kicks in, but by now, you love it, or youre out. Strength, too, sets its feelers out and begins to trickle into the feeling and the brain, as well. Sticky and treacly, though dark, and thoroughly delicious, if your tastes run like mine.
It rolls around and around the mouth, washing all the senses with this rich, dark, utterly decadent flavor. 
Oh, what dark malts can do, for this flavor is so rich, so thick, so fully flavorful, this is decadence, indeed.

1040,"2004-08-24",4.6,"Bottled.  I called up the nearest beer store that had access to Stone to see if they could get this and was gladly informed they had a case coming in...I told him my interest, he said held buy another case.  Ill be drinking this until next spring.  Anyways...pourse a deep brown color, black, BLACK in the glass with a small brown head with excellently flowing stout bubbles as glass tilts, nice lacing and that tiny head lasts fully.  Rich, deep aroma of chocolate, nuts, mild coffee, all roasted, alcohol, smells rich, balanced and dry; clean and creamy.  Touch of banana once it gets to room temp!  Mouth is creamy, thick, lots of soft, soft, soft creamy carbonation lasting until after you swallow(provided that you let the bottle sit before pouring, pour it cold and the carbonation dies!), pleasantly dry, exceptionally dry for something so thick, heavy and malt laden.  Flavor is noticably alcoholic, but pleasantly so, provided that you sip it and especially when you consider the rest of the flavors.  Also...so rich, complex...firmly roasty, burned, holding you while it feeds you alcohol, chocolate, coffee, oak.  I like more of a hidden alcohol presence, not a prominent one, although the warning is nice...even though I dont listen.  Terrifically balanced, even though the finish is decidedly bitter(yet not overly so, quite pleasant), the beer is well balanced when you consider everything thats in it and how powerful this stuff is.  Not a big beer, but a tremendous one.  This 22oz is a meal, dessert and a few beers with your meal!  Im making chile, but meh...this stuff may well suffice.  Drinking this stuff is like being challenged to a dual...you think to give up, but the aftertaste is so nice, you like so much, you just keep drinking it--despite some of its less desirable qualities...basically its too alcoholic and thats the only undesirable and related to flavor alone.  So warming though...Ill drink this stuff and laugh at the snow outside.","Reno, Nevada, USA","0o9i"

1040,"2004-08-20",4.6,"The beer looked very dark brown and fully opaque with a nice foamy cream coffee colored head.  The look was closer to a regular stout than the inky black appearance that some other Imperial Stouts assume.  The aroma was very roasty and chocolaty, with strong notes of anise and licorice.  The taste was most impressive, with an intoxicating combination of fruits, coffee, chocolate, and bitter hops that all attempted to squash my taste buds into submission.  The alcohol was quite evident in its peppery warmth at the back of the throat that traveled way down into the stomach.  There is no attempt at subtlety here at all.

Very well balanced with no one flavor dominating.  There was a definite alcohol warming.  THIS is how you do high alcohol.  Too many big alcohol beers are out there that overwhelm you with alcohol flavor.  This was done right.

2002 Bottle aged 5 years.  I have heard that some of these were infected. Fortunately for me, this doesnt smell or taste the least bit infected.  The pour is smooth and black.  Even held up to sunlight, there is no light showing nor any hint of any color other than black.  The carbonation is still very much alive and the bubbles produced are surprisingly large.  It almost looked like I poured a coke.  The head eventually settles to a ring of dark tan cream around the glass.  Swirly results in some spotty bubbles on the sides of the glass, but nothing I would call lacing.  The aroma is heavily chocolate with some mild roast.  I dont smell any alcohol.  Maybe just a touch of fruit or anise hiding in the background.  The flavor profile is much the same as the bouquet, but I cant detect the anise in the flavor.  The body is a little thin, but Im guess that can be attributed to the age.  A pleasure to drink and still very good, but I think 2 years is the target for this beer. 8/3/7/4/17","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","shadey"

1040,"2004-07-21",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 17, 2005 (2003 edition) This is an intense beer, as you would expect.  Aged for just over a year, this beer poured out of the bottle with little head, but wonderful lacing along the glass.  The smell os of coffee and nuts and a hint of alcohol.  The taste is full and dominating.  A bit more aggressive than the rasputin or storm king, but Im not sure its necessarily better.  Given the other comments, this beer may have mellowed a bit over the past year as its also wonderfully smooth and tender.

Re-Rate Summer 2005 edition: intensely thick and viscous.  HUGE aroma and huge taste.  Perhaps Ive come more around on these larger Impies, but this just seemed better than what I had rated it before.","Madrid, SPAIN","CamdenD"

1040,"2004-07-16",4.4,"Late 2003 edition. Pours, in spent motor oil fashion, a near black color with almost no tan head. The aroma is sweet dark chocolate, in muffin form, slightly fruity. Not all that complex, but wonderful anyways. From the start this beer is velvety smooth, very little carbonation. This is about as full-bidied as it gets. Punishingly sweet chocolate, the bitterness comes later on, and the finish is long and lingering. The coffee flavors are restrained by copious amounts of sugar and cream. The hops are subdued as well, especially for Stone. This is a chocolate lovers dream; pair this with some good dark chocolate (70%) and melt away. Filling and damn strong. The taste holds steady from 45 to 70 degrees, with just a bit more of the alcohol appearing towards the end of the bottle. Just a great beer.","Somerville, Massachusetts, USA","DrGonzo"

1040,"2004-07-12",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 10, 2006 Ill stick with my original score, but add some thoughts.  The 2006 version doesnt seem to be nearly as hoppy and uses a pleathora of roasted malt instead.  I dont think Id have enjoyed it as much this time around had it retained all of those piney/citric properties.  Theres still significant hop bitterness, it just doesnt seem to make itself as well known in the aroma and flavor profile.  But damn, this is fine stuff.  Major props to a west coast brewer who chose not to force-feed a beautifully malty Impy with off-key hops.

22 oz bottle, snifter.  Caramel, chocolate, coffee, roasted malt (H); flower, spruce, and citrus hops (M); light alcohol, banana, prune, pear, port, cask wood, smoke, vanilla, pepper aromas.  Average sized, creamy, dark head is well lasting and sits on a deep black body.  Heavily sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter flavor becomes a moderately sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter finish.  Full body, oily/creamy texture, lively carbonation.  Astringent finish.  The bottom line is: acidity and astringency will hopefully improve with time...if only I can keep from opening my other bottle!","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

Pours a pitch black color that supports a deep brown creamy head.  Rich dark malt aromas waft from my glass, and are joined by notes of rum, burnt raisins, toasted biscuits, and a fair amount of grain character.  The taste is intensely malty, and it almost has a saltiness to it.  It is quite rich, yet somehow light for an Imperial Stout.  There is a nice low level of malt sweetness here that balances the roast character, and each of these components is in some way muted by the interaction of the other.  This beer is definitely rich and creamy from the front end to just before the finish, after this the burnt, roast malt flavors kick in and linger around a bit
2001 Bottling, Sampled June 2004
I have been saving this bottle for quite a while.  Since I am going to be getting a case of the 2004 pretty soon I decided that now would be a good time to try an aged sample.

It pours motor oil black with a deep dark brown thin head.  It is quite a clear deep brown color when held up to the light through a thin cross section.  The aroma is ripe with notes of dried prunes, raisins, miso, and sherry.  There appears to be at least some oxidation character in the nose.  Underneath the other aromas I get hints of espresso, and roasted barley.  The beer is still quite thick and viscous; it is fairly sweet up front with strong dark malt flavors just dominating my palate.  This is incredibly tasty and has aged quite well in my closet.  It is slightly oxidized, which adds more complexity to this already complex beast, there is a hint of sherry and some port notes, but none of the wet cardboard type oxidation flavors.  It is quite fruity up front with notes of prune, raisin, and cherry.  The finish is dry and slightly astringent from all of the dark malt notes that includes espresso, burnt toast, and roasted barley.

Did I say that this is damn tasty?  It is quite smooth, and just slides viscously down my throat, coating my entire mouth with lingering flavors that refuse to dissipate entirely.  I take another sip and the process begins anew.  The middle of this beer is laden with smooth dark malt flavors, but the burnt/ roast character of this beer really only hits you at the very end.  As this beer slowly disappears and as it continues to warm up, it just gets better and better.  This beer is awesome right now; I am definitely going to have to age quite a few of the 2004 vintage.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Touch of pepsin, more chocolate notes, cream, mint, anise, and dark fruit.  The layers of flavor are subtle (for an Imperial) and well integrated.  The flavor lingers in your mouth long after the swallow without losing intensity.  A stunningly good brew.  NOTE:  2006 version rather different, most notably sweeter with more of a molasses element thrown in.  Good, but not quite on par with previous years IMHO.  Leaving up previous rating, as I think that is probably the most representative of what this beer in top form is all about.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

1040,"2004-03-22",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 28, 2004  Blind Tasting, thanks Jazz88  Black hue with almost no head, just a light brown ring. Aroma proposes a solid malt profile of dark chocolate and possibly marshmallows, perhaps a touch of salt as well. Bold grapefruity hops accompany this all. Up to now its nothing special. In mouth, the malt profile is huge. Very full-flavoured caramel and brown sugar together with a profound grapefruity hoppiness. The difference is.. it works here, very balanced and intense at the same time. You dont realize how hoppy this is before a few sips. Mouthfeel is excellent, silky and full bodied with low carbonation. My main critics are the almost absent fruitiness and restrained roastiness. But as one who didnt particularly enjoy what he had from Stone, I was bound to recognize in a blind tasting that their imperial stout is world-class. Delicious and one of the best, as much as I hate to admit it.  resampling not blind a few months later: quite sweet, lightly vinous, big balancing bitterness.

Creamy and roasty on the nose at first, but then more seemed to emerge. At times I got vanilla and at other times chocolate. At all times coffee, but mild and in the background.

1040,"2004-03-01",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2007 22 oz bottle, 2003.  Nearly opaque black, very little brownish head.  Some quick-dying fizziness.  Very intense and beautiful dried fruit-grape nose, with a slight roasty edge and some milk chocolate.  Taste:  very very sweet at first, sweet port and chocolate baked pears and raisins and creme brulee, vanilla-almond milk, and very bitter slightly grape-tinged chocolate near the end.  Little coffee roastiness, and weirdly balanced, but absolutely wonderful and fully deserving of its reputation.  I havent always been Stones biggest partisan, but this and the IPA certainly convince me of their abilities.

A little later .. this really is a bit too sweet, not quite cloying, but... as it approaches room temp it does get syrupy, and the hops just dont cut through quite enough.  Very good, but I guess Im starting to appreciate the more robust examples of the style more than these candy-canes. 9/4/9/3 17 4.2


November 2007, another bottle from the same (late Spring 2003) batch sampled above, now 4.5 years old, cellar temperature from a Maudite glass.  A bit of fizz left as the cap is popped....and a fair bit of lasting dark foam atop the ebony.....the nose is at first nothing but sherryish and oxidized, grapy, but with a minute or two of breathing some chocolaty-roasty notes show up and its fairly pleasant....much better on the tongue, in fact this has dried out considerably, the sweetness is not overpowering and near-cloying as I usually find it to be when fresh, the sweet chocolate somewhat liquor-ish (though not really alcoholic, if that makes sense), a better melding of light coffee, fig, and candy...finishes with just a trace of booze, and just a tad papery.  This has aged phenomenally well; judging from my feelings about this beer when fresh and the only slight diminution of body at 4.5 years, Id say this will be a gem with about 2 years on it.

Pours pitch black! I had to pour quite vigorously to get a decent head on it, but when it got there is was fine and brown. The head did last a while, though.

Smells of wonderful coffee. Very malty, as a stout should be.

I gotta be honest about the taste, though. It's good, but not *that* good. For a top-ranked beer, let alone an Imperial Stout, I was expecting something a little...more? Very stong coffee flavor is the first sensation. There's some caramel there as well. The hops also make an appearance, but they definately hide in the background.

Mouthfeel is *really* thick and full. It's not quite syrupy, but almost.

Drinkability is good. The high alcohol content is well hidden. I was expecting something more over the top both in intensity and alcohol taste. 

I gotta admit I'm a bit disappointed. This beer gets a lot of hype and I don't think it lives up to it. I *like* this beer, I just don't think it lives up to the hype. I grabbed an extra to age, I'll revisit soon.","Port Orchard, Washington, USA","Gromit"

Flavor initially is hard to place as it does not establish itself with many predominate flavors. By my best estimate it is a mixture of chocolate, cola, a very slight soy sauce, a very slight coffee.

Big barley-wineish aroma, alcohol perceptible, in a good way.  Begins with lots of dark roasted barley, dark bitter chocolate and a resinous, maybe vinous hops flavor that is lush and slightly syrupy.  Good clean brown sugar flavor as well.  Noticeable acidity suggests this is quite young and has plenty aging potential.  Slight saltiness, but more of a cognac flavor in the background (though sweeter than cognac). Quite delicious.  Some licorice detectable in the aftertaste and a good thick body creates a very distinct and memorable beer.   Beer is not overdone.  Texture is rich and smooth. Salty at times, but well defined and has no problem with carbonation.  2003 bottle aged almost 18 months  Starting to show signs of wear.  Not nearly as thick and creamy a palate as I remember, though it still is delightfully smooth and oily, I couldnt help thinking that after only 18 months, this was really showing more oxidation than I would expect.  Im torn between liking this better fresh or aged because fresh, it is thicker, which I like, but aged, the huge hops bitterness is much more under control and smoothed out.  Alcohol a bit too perceptible on the finish.  More of an oaty flavor than I remember as well.

The flavor pulls things from everywhere starting with very subtle hops to roasted coffee, chocolate, and a complex dark and evil fruitiness that really just tops it off.

This may be to foreshadow the evil effects it will have upon your opinions of other beers. The aroma smacks you hard with chocolate, malt, hops, and some plum fruit. All distinct, but yet one aroma. It's as if this beer transforms it's smell continously. Upon sipping this silky smooth liquid satin, intense plum, chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt flavors bind your tastebuds. Assertive but well balanced hops secure the knots as this deliciously evil brew takes you hostage. You are assaulted by such intense flavors that it is impossible to distinguish the beginning of one from the end of another.

1040,"2003-09-23",4.0,"Thick & dark opaque brown, almost black body w/a cocoa brown head.  The head falls pretty quickly, probably due to alcohol, but it laces well.  Nose is roasty chocolate w/ some caramel and alcohol fruitiness, as well as a little solventy alcohol notes.  The fruitiness is there, but it seems to come from alcohol rather than dark fruit.  Alcohol and chocolate dominate initial sip, but then it turns to roasty coffee and a hop finish.  Reasonably well balanced w/ light bitterness, still no dark fruit.  Carmels creeps in after the first few sips.  Fuller body but not chewy w/ minimal carbonation and a warming alcohol presence.  It seems as though American Micros take the roasty chocolate approach to Imperial Stouts and seem to lack the dark fruit character the their English counterparts have.  I'm disappointed in that fact, but not with this beer.  Given a couple more years of cellaring, it may develope the dark fruit character I so desire.

Not much in the way of hops aromas either. Just burnt. Slight solvent aroma indicates the high alcohol levels in this monster. Tasted good, however.

My Guinness? Makes Guinness taste like a standard pilsner. Oops, where'd the head go? Maybe like light in a black hole, the head was sucked in on itself. The beer now is oily, and when I roll it around in the glass, like 'Kilroy Was Here', it leaves its oily signature all over. Last sip.

Hints of roasted malt, anise, brown sugar, Vienna roast coffee, date and  a light hop twang. Vinous. The mouthfeel is pure delight. It's oily heavy, chewy and syrupy, yet not very sticky. The alcohol cleans the palate nicely. Big malt sweetness is fully countered by spicy hops, a work of art to balance this monster. Taste also hinted of twangy smoke and Turkish coffee dryness.

Nice lacing along the glass while the head lasts, but like most good things, it's not forever.  Nose is not terribly strong, of subtle, inviting, dark, roasted chocolate.  Taste jumps out with dark roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate malt.  Medium-full body and smooth mouthfeel with a dark sweetness that hints at growing overwhelming but somehow still remains on the edges (and roof) of the mouth.

Flavor is of alcohol and maybe slight hop eventually giving way to a light coffee, bittler finish - more coffee than bitter.  This beer warms the belly.  Alcohol flavor is a tad too much and makes this beer not all that appealing.  Others do it better with more flavor and less emphasis on alcohol/ alcohol content.

That means black to the unmotorized-friendly. A waffer thin, tightly sponged, light cocoa brown head sits atop which fades to a skim always present, lace sticks in ink blot patches.

Smell is subdued but moderately present of dark roasted malts and black malts, quite lusciously so...a light sense of dark fruits favoring raisin, plum, fig, and alcohol warmth mixing in the nose with some chocolate sweetness and coffee notes in there as well.

Taste is quite creamy rich and moderately hefty, but mellowing of dark roasty malts with a slight coffeeness, hops arrive quickly with favorable rich bitterness that fits in quite nicely helping finishing this out with some chocolate twingy tangyness.

Quite a nice easy heavily creamy full body, rich, lusious, and filling, with an incredible lingering chocolate and mild hop bitter drying finish with a bit of alcoholic warmth showing up late taking effect on your head after half the bottle or so.

Well, Greg said that the recipe for this has not changed. If it hasen't changed then why is there so much more alcohol?  Why is the body so much more watery than it used to be?

1040,"2003-07-17",3.5,"This beer unfortunately did not sway me from the belief that imperial stouts are much overhyped. This was an above average brew, but not nearly as complex, entertaining, or tasty as the average baltic porter. I find this brew analogous to Alaskan Amber. They are both good beers, with fair, rounded flavors appearing following aeration and warming--beers you would not hesitate to drink again-each good for its own season and occasion, but neither are anywhere near 4pt beers--imo.  
Black forest body with a perfect chocolate head--I am certainly prejudiced in favor of dark beers.  Deep black malts appear aromatically from the start, running into deeper vinous veins that stretch as the beer warms finishing in a slap of chocolate alcohol. The flavor is more ordinary, with coffee and chocolate on the finish, preceded by weak cloud of black malt.

I couldnt smell too much from this beer, which is really my only knock on it.  Once it was in my mouth I was delighted with robust flavors of malt, dark fruits, raisins, yeast, brown sugar and a tad bit of soy sauce. The main focus here are the malts, which are sweet, decadent and very complex. Aftertaste wasn't too long and finished with alcohol and a coffee bitterness. I was actually surprised that there weren't more chocolate and coffee flavors, which seem to be typical of this style; however, it was in no way lacking and actually ended up better because there wasn't much to distract from the excellent malt flavor. In many respects, its crafty sweetness, rich malt and alcohol taste reminded me of a Jr. DFH WWS.

2004 vintage. Pours pitch black. Not even a bit of light coming through this! Small tan head. Consistency of used motor oil. Very thick!

More coffee and licorice with alcohol, molasses, dark chocolate, and rum soaked fruit. The roasted character really comes through and is nicely balanced with the alcohol and sweetness.

2003 -   Black.  Dark brown head.  Musty, smoky aroma filled with firewood, charcoal and licorice.  Extremely thick and rich, sickly syrupy, with a very good alcohol cover.  Flavors jumping out throughout the drink include maple, smoke, and espresso.

Too thick, and actually too mellow, feels like triple bock or something similar.  Missing the characteristic sharp bite of imperials.  Good cover, but these things arent supposed to be covered so well.

2004 -  holy hell this improved... the new batch is a rich smoky demonic motor oil... doesnt have that lactic sweet chemical flavor anymore.


2006, fresh:
Milky, creamy charred wood scents in this one, though it seems the nose is more soft that previous years, but its hard to tell when every beer is impacted by set and setting.  Flavor is very sweet, with even a plastic cayenne flavor in there, only sugary and very sweet... some maple as well.

Some berries do linger on the palate which is really an odd kick, thinking this should be purely roasty and toasty flavours.

This beer has a soft but chewy mouth-feel, yet the flavor is sweet and coffee like. This is honestly the best example of an Imperial Stout that I have ever had, the only problem I found with this beer is that it is packaged in an un-soberingly large 22oz bottle. This beer is incredibly viscous and filling, but it is a brew that truly rocks!!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

1040,"2003-06-26",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 2, 2009 2003This is probably the darkest looking stout Ive had. First scent to hit my nose as I uncapped this 22oz bottle was cocoa and espresso. Reminded me of an espresso gelato I once had. Very enticing aromas, from a deep black brew with a thin head resting atop. Chocolate, espresso, intensely roasted malts and hints of alcohol and yeast. Velvety smooth stout, extremely smooth and approachable with a slight dryness at the end. Superbly balanced and pure decadence. This is the best product Ive had from Stone brewery. I drank this bottle at approx. 65 degrees.","Cape Coral Waterfront Wonderland, Florida, USA","BierBauch"
1040,"2003-06-24",4.8,"The 2002 was my latest. Viscous, ebon liquid with a great, complex nose and taste. Burnt toast, coffee, cocoa, malt, shale, mineral, leather, and very subtle hop flavors. Incredibly smooth despite the malt/alcohol content. One could get lost just in the aromas, but the taste is so rich and full that it feels like a mouthful of stout nearly 30 seconds after you've swallowed. This is definitely one of my top 25 beers of all time.","San Clemente, California, USA","Smacky"
1040,"2003-06-23",4.7,"man is this stuff good.  Great stout smell, with coffee, malt, and choclate aromas.  And the falvor is the same. Deep black color and a clean finish.  A wonderful dessert beer.  And now tied for my favorite imperial stout.","Chico, California, USA","GreatStelle"
1040,"2003-06-22",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 24, 2003 2003 release.  Pours very very black, with a decent amount of dark tan head that rapidly dissapates.  Tiny bit of chocolate, some coffee and lots of roasted malt in the flavor, with just a touch of hops coming through.  Pretty big alcohol burn.  A nice special occasion beer, in my opinion, but not something I would drink every week, like an Old Rasputin.

1040,"2003-06-18",5.0,"UPDATED: SEP 9, 2007 Spring 03 release: Complete and totally black. Licorice, coffee, and a slight roastiness and alcohol aroma. Not much head or lacing going on in my glass. Lots of wonderful maltiness and I like to let it linger in my mouth for awhile. The finish is a combo of malt sweet and hoppy bitterness (my only complaint would be not enough bitter). Really comes alive once it warms up a bit. I have not yet reached uber beer geek status, but in my humble opinion this imperial stout is the shit. I cant wait to buy some more.

EDIT: I rated this one a couple of weeks ago and I feel I have to tell you that I cant stop drinking the stuff. Im going to go broke at $5 a bottle and the local liquor store only lets me buy two at a time. This is truly a wonderful beer.


RE-RATE: Ive had every release since the original rating. My palate has done nothing but improve and I still come back each year and find this to be one of the most delightfull experiences.

1040,"2003-06-13",4.1,"Had on tap at Callahan's on Wednesday, June 11th, 2003Oddly enough, it's taken me this long to rate this beer that's available all over the place here in San Diego.  This amazingly complex beer has a small, slightly tan head with a pitch black coloring.  The lacing is quite good and lasts from start to finish.  The flavors jump out of the pint glass and just drag you in - from coffee to chocolate to a sweet berry flavor.  While the alcohol level isn't masked as well as other stouts I've tried, they do a good job and the beer is extremely drinkable.  I'm still a sucker for the Double Bastard, but this Imperial Stout is a great beer and a fine Stone offering.","Orange, California, USA","Blake"
1040,"2003-06-10",4.7,"wow this is really really good. pours jet black and totaly opague with a deep tan head that slowly disapates but still leaves lacing. massive amounts of toffee, chocolate, and coffee flavors, yet is still very drinkable (empahsis on very). its like a punch in the face that feels like a kiss. this is the epitimy of what a good stout should be. well done stone.","Ohio, USA","gerdy555"
1040,"2003-06-09",4.7,"Oh my god! This is nirvana, valhalla, the pentultimate of stout! Stone has totally outdone themselves with this magnificent brew. Indeed, it pours with the thickness of used motor oil...damned near the thickness of molasses! A beautiful brown head which fairly quickly dissipates becomes evident. Then, the aroma. Oh, how delicious and sweet it truly is! Complex, to be sure, but the overwheliming notes of chocolate mocha coffee are surely there. The mouthfeel is like sweet syrup, with a bit of a hint of salt. Black currants become evident as this wickedly marvelous brew begins to warm. And the malt, oh the lucious, delicious malt! Like a chocolate, malty, mocha shake. The alcohol? No hint, none, it's so well and gorgeously hidden, yet the power of this brew is quite subtle. This is THE perfect brew. The color is opaque, with a VERY bright light, you hint a note of ruby red. I cannot believe how marvelous this brew is. It is, IMNSHO, the best stout on the planet, BAR NONE. I'm in love, totally and absolutely in love, and it is must assuredly not infatuation!","San Diego, California, USA","BeerRunner"
1040,"2003-06-08",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2015   Syrupy black, tar-like body, thin head. Strong roasted mocha/chocolate aroma. Flavor is more of the same, with powdery coffee notes and strong dark chocolate. Soft mouthfeel. Slightly sweet notes of black licorice and black plum. Hoppy finish for the style, smooth. Hops dominate the finish and nicely balance the large ABV. Chocolate flavor lingers, pleasant.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
1040,"2003-06-07",4.4,"22 oz. bomber, 2003 Release.  This Bolshevik beauty pours almost like molasses - thick, black and opaque.  Absolutely no light makes its way through this stout-hearted Imperialist.  A small brown head formed and took its own time to recede to a murky ring around the top of the dense liquid. The aroma is also molasses, Italian roast coffee and raspberries  it was love at first sniff.  This bottle was refrigerated and though I gave it about 15 minutes to warm before opening (I have to admit to a little impatience), it wasn't enough.  The flavor was initially a little disappointing with the alcohol too prominent for my tastes.  Though as it warmed, the sweet burnt chocolate, coffee and black currents came to the fore with the alcohol receding nicely to assume a more balanced role.  This brew prowls around on the palate like the rich, dark, syrup your pancakes always dreamed of.  Then it slips away leaving an enigmatic and intriguing bitter-sweet finish that languorously fades to a happy memory.  My advice: drink this unruly Russian warm and slowly to reap the greatest reward.  Additional patience may be of benefit as well while this still brash brew ages and mellows, I can hardly wait to see what the bottles I've cellared taste like 3, 6, 9 and 12 months down the road!","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"
1040,"2003-06-05",4.2,"Very nice, big stout.  Sweet flavor with strong hints of coffee.  Might have opened it a bit soon - maybe give it a year in the bottle (it's bottle conditioned), it had a strong alcoholic warmth that could use a little mellowing.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","invalid"
1040,"2003-06-04",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2004 This is sooooo gooooood.  Tates a bit like Rogue shakespeare, but a lot better.  It's very thick and pretty sweet.  It's smoother than my favorite (old favorite?) Rasputin.  It's going down way too fast and I can feel it catching up to me.  I'm drinking it a bit on the warm side and look forward to drinking it just a bit cooler.  I bought case but might go back and get another before it's gone.

Rerate 2004 release 061504:  I think this is like a cros between Rasputin and Speedway.  It has the coffe, hops and dryness of the Rasputin, but also has some of the sweet creaminess that Speedway has.

1040,"2003-05-23",4.7,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2005 Re-Rate of an 03 on 3.5.2005:  Still one helluva stout, but now it is bursting with aroma.  Coffee and chocolate are all over the place, but upon closer inspection, caramel, molasas and alcohol are present. Which is why I upped the Aroma to 10 from 8.  The flavor has an odd spot in the middle, which is keeping it from a perfect 5.  Otherwise, Amazing brew.    

2003 bottle, rated on 5.23.03 :Dark black with a nice shine to it.  Very thin brown foam that disappeared as soon as it formed.  Smell is very heavy on the coffee.  Smoked and a little chocolate is present also.  First taste is extremely heavy and thick.  This hits with the alcohol bite right after it leaves your tongue, then smooths out with the malty goodness one might expect.  As this one warmes up it is quite a thing of beauty.  Not as hard on the palate because the alcohol is hidden better, and the malts take its place.  Strong on the coffee and roasted flavor are all over this again with a very nice sweetness. Cant say enough nice things about this one honestly, certainly one of the most drinkable beers thats this goddamn strong.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","MAP"
1040,"2003-05-23",4.0,"Wow, Greg!  What a wicked-ass brew!  I popped this vicious beast open and poured it into my wide-mouth glass.  Yowza!  Never such a dark and thick beer have I seen.  Almost no head.  Top of this liquid looks like a thick espresso.  Taste is like a thick, rich espresso (only sweeter) with a slightly bitter bite at the end.  The light malty taste helps balance it out, and you are left with the great sensation of varied roasted flavors that compliment the beer well.  Is there Belgian chocolate in this beer?  Hmmm...  You know.  This has a nice finish that isn't as hard on the hops as Victory's Storm King.  I'm impressed.  I think that my old Mitsubishi used to drip this stuff.

1040,"2003-05-15",3.4,"UPDATED: MAY 16, 2003 Damn this is a huge beer. Pours a deep oily black with a velvety brown film of a head. Nose of dark chocolate, coffee, and alcohol. Full, round mouthfeel. Notes of raisins, liquorish, molasses. Extremely rich. Goes along great until the intensely bitter finish. The anise notes along with the hops are just too much. It sort of tastes like someone poured Jagermeister in it. I was wincing by the end of my glass. A quasi-masochistic pleasure I must admit but not one I'm going to partake in often.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
1040,"2003-05-14",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 30, 2003 (new 2003 release) Poured jet black (always a good sign) with a quickly dissipating tan head.  Aroma dominated by roasted and chocolate notes.  Nice, thick, viscous mouthfeel.  Flavor is dominated by roasted chocolate, with a sweet malty backbone.  Well-done.  I place this a couple notches above Victory Storm King (which has a hoppier essence with a thinner body) but below the ridiculous Bells Expedition.  I have to give Stone credit though: their malty, viscous beast is at least carbonated (Note to Bells...)!  My experience with Stone suggests that this brewer deserves all the hype it receives.  The IPA and Ruination IPA are waiting...for another day, alas.  Does this deserve a poem?

Stone Imperial, thick succulent jelly Warms my throat, mouth and young belly Reaches my brain and causes a smile Nice to drink an Imperial, it's been awhile.

Warming, smooth, succulent beast My wallet thanks you, bank account not upset in the least.  Lucky me, when you're gone, another bottle's in store A wise decision I must say, and a satisfying score.  There's still half of you left in my glass I do see Before you're gone I bet I'll go pee!  For Stone Imperial Stout is a delectable brew My mind has been made, my desire anew To seek out the stout and drink of its glory Dark, malty it's true, always good for a story.

1040,"2003-04-10",5.0,"Limited Late Spring 2002 Release.  Pours very thick into the pint glass.  I could hardly hear a splash.  The color is black with a huge brown/beige head that slowly reduces to a half inch and holds there leaving a nice dark lace all the way down.  There is a fine carbonation.  I caught myself repeatedly tilting the glass and quicly tilting it back upright to watch the fine bubbles try and catch up to the head.  The smell is pleasant and complex.  I notice hints of currant, raisin, black cherry, caramel, dark chocolate and coffee to name a few.  There is a fine balance of malty sweetness and hop bitterness along with the complex flavor.  The taste seems familiar but difficult for me to describe and yes, exceptional.  I wonder if all of the ingredients I used to describe the odor were put in a blender and mixed thoroughly, if this would be the resulting flavor.  I guess I'd also have to mention the nougat like odors as well, but I'll never know because I will save some time and go buy another bottle or two.  The mouthfeel is silky smooth and creamy thick with a nice tingle from the carbonation.  The 22 oz. bottle left me definately looking forward to my next opportunity to grab another.

1040,"2003-03-19",4.3,"(2002 Release) This beer is very dark, perhaps opaque. I poured at a normal pace and the end result was a wonderful thick tan head and lasting lace. The nose is very fruity with a touch of dark chocolate. The palate is thick and warming. I am surprised how fruity this beer is, I was expecting a hop bomb. Fruity is not an underestimation either; there are wonderful flavors of raspberry and black currant. What balances out all the lovely fruitiness is a foundation of rich malt that is very rich in chocolate flavors. As for the finish, it is mellow and reminds me off a good café latte. Heading into this beer, I expected something that would be hopped to the max. It is great to know that Stone can make a well-balanced beer.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","HighGravity"
1040,"2003-03-14",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2005 2002 edition :This is one big beer. The only Imperial Stout Ive had but this is amazing. Pours like motor oil and it has a good warming feeling to it. Despite the 10% ABV it doesnt dominate. If you like stouts dont pass this one up. It has no flaws!........2003 edition : Didnt get it due to our bitch ass distributor!.......2004 edition : This just came in to town today. When I had the previous 02 version this beer came as quite a shock, I had never tried an Imperial Stout before. But now Im ready. So here it goes. Pitch black with a suprisingly small head. Flavor is quite sweet with some licorice, loads of coffee beans, some dark chocolate, smoke and tobacco. The alcohol lets you know its hanging around. Like ""Hi, this beer is 10.8% and dont you freaking forget it!"" Theres not a load of hops in this beer, which one may expect from Stone. If this were just a tad less sweet it would probably be perfect. 2004 edition a year later : My how this beer has changed. The rough around the edges alcohol burn of a new bottle is now gone. The sweetness and syrupy feel is toned down. The balance is great on this one after a year of aging! Try one Komrad, as the bottle states. 2005 edition : Minus the Russian thanks you PC pieces of crap. Well anyway the appearance is still pitch black. This one has less alcohol showing through than previous young vintages. The flavor is less sticky sweet than the young 2004 with a heavy dose of milk chocolate and raisins coming through. It seems to be more balanced.  Unlike previous vintages this one is smooth and velvty in its young form and should only improve with age. Great stuff after all these beers!","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"

It takes the first couple of sips to get adjusted to the beer (high alcohol), but afterwards it is not even an issue.  Very complex, remniscient of a dogfish head worldwide stout.

1040,"2003-01-22",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2003 (1/22/03) Sweet plum and molasses aroma from the black oily body with a light brown head.  The onset of flavor is almost overly sweet, but it mellows toward the finish.  Body consists of cranberry, raisin, and lots of malt with a thick palate.  Lightly hoppy with a touch of bitterness in the finish.  Hides its abv very well.  The 2002 bottle almost tastes like it's been aged for a few years.

Re-Rate (6/12/03): It's true the 2002 bottle I just tried was sour.  Too acidic for enjoyment.  This loses points for an imperial stout that can't last a year.

Third rating 2003 vintage (10/31/03):  This is much better than the soured 2002 I tried last.  In fact this is better than the fresh 2002 I remember.  Has a nice thick sweet body with even some bock character to it.  Roasted malt and plums are the main flavors supplemented with an assertive bitterness.  A very nice beer that I hope ages better than last year.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1040,"2003-01-22",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2003 Very rich, intense aroma.  The alcohol is evident and so is the sweetness of this beer--sweeter than other ImpStouts I've tried.  The balance of malts and hops, however, is wonderful.  Bitterness subdued and present in the end of the swallow.  Quite tart, acidic, and irony, especially as the beer grew warmer.  Lots of fruits like apples and pears in the finish and it was also quite dry.  Overall very well done.","Washington DC, USA","jskendzel"
1040,"2003-01-20",4.0,"A tasty offering to be sure.  It is quite complex, with notes of coffee, chocolate, some fruitiness, some ""funny"" tartness or sourness.  The alcohol heat is very prevelant (not much of an attempt to conceal it) but it works well in this brew.  The beer has almost no head and has no carbonation to speak of.  It is thick and syruppy in texture.  This likely my favorite imperial stout so far, but I've only really sampled a small handful.  It is not a very hoppy Imp. Stout (especially for a stone beer).","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","dhurtubise"
1040,"2003-01-16",3.7,"Definitely opaque, but there""s a steady source of bubbles rising up the perimeter, light froth around the edges of the glass.  Complex nose, lots of molasses and brown sugar, amaretto, sweet dark malt, and pungent hops.  Thick mouthfeel, bordering on syrupy.  Very sweet, nearly cloying, with a welcome touch of puckering astringency.  Becomes salty at room temperature.  Too sweet for me...I thought this was Stone, where""s the hop onslaught?  Also, I find the palate lacks the complexity, dark fruit, roastiness etc. I look for in the style.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"

1040,"2003-01-09",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 18, 2007 (my original rating of this seems extremely ignorant, either that or I had a slightly off bottle - it is now one of my favorite imperials, right behind alesmith and bells) Great, jet black, opaque appearance and the perfect amount of carbonation.  I expected a bit more from the aroma, it just has a gentle maltiness.  This has decent body and nice coffee flavor, and I can curtainly taste the anise and currants the commerical description suggests.  There is a brief bitterness that is very suprising.  This beer seems like a beefed-up version of Heavyweight Imperial Porter.  Not bad at all.  Thanks Racegoer!","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
1040,"2003-01-08",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2004 Pitch black color, opaque, with a nice light brown head. The aroma was full of coffee, cherry, dark chocolate, and alcohol.

Beautiful work of art!","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"

Best imperial stout that I have had.","Southampton, Pennsylvania, USA","amx1970390"

1040,"2003-01-02",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 28, 2004 I'm really beginning to feel this beer with every sip. Motor-oil darkness with a little blood redness around the edges. Head is firm and lasting, yet subdued. Big, yeast-cake nose teases the olfactory senses. Mouthfeel is soft and gentle, with a light milkshake-like presence. My gums cringed with acidity though. Some roast; some coffee; some dark fruit; some of a lot of other things too. Oily flavors linger and dance and prance in the mouth, long after the music has stopped. Sweet and sour flavors swirl. Lasting and enjoyable. Re-rate, 2004: Smooth and rewarding palate. Very rich and chocolaty with dark-roasted malt flavors throughout. Acidity is not like it was last year -- much better. Warm alcohol. Quite a large hop presence, leaving behind a decent amount of bitterness. Really good stuff.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

Original:  Pumpkin spice nose.  Nice balance of malt and hops, which is very noticable.  An excellent craft beer that demonstrates an equitable drinking experience.

1040,"2002-12-25",4.9,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2003 An absolutely impressive and unmistakable Stout by Stone Breweries. Even before the first sip the brown/black hue lets you know you have quite a kick awaiting you! The color shows signs of amber towards the end, but through and through, it is a magnificent looking piece of work. The smells of coffee and alcohol are extremely appealing and the taste does dances around the tongue. It absolutely grabs your tongue and takes it along for the ride. It has a very strong, defined taste that is not for the beer unsophisticates. An impressive Stout worthy of a very high rating. Update: Upon my second taste of a mildly aged bottle, this is the king of beers thus far. This is the type of booty wars were fought over! Outstanding....in a word

RERATE 12/25/02: Aroma of coffee, espresso, mocha, vanilla, and roast. Head of a mild orangey brown color, and a viscous liquid black as death even when held directly in front of a light source. A taste of berries, chocolate, caramel, cracker jacks, espresso, mocha, coffee, and alcohol which only gets stronger and fuller with each taste. After facing this against my other favorites, there is no comparison....the imperial russian stout is by far tops in my book, nothing even comes close.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"
1040,"2002-12-17",4.1,"Limited late spring 2002 release:  Chocolatey head with a syrupy texture, faint aroma revealing some of the alcohol content.

Thanks to hopsrus for the trade!!!!!!!","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","jpknight22"

1040,"2002-12-10",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2004 Finally, a rerate: This is quite sweet. Hoppiness kicks in and the beer ends up a bit winey when fully warmed up. The alcohol presence is pretty in your face. Ultimately a fine beer, but not enough roastiness to counter the super sweet something in there.
Original: uhhh, excellent, so much in there! I really should have had it earlier in the evening, without previous beers, and slower. But I have one more bottle!","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"

Smooth as butter, but packs all the flavor you could ever want in a fine beer. Lovin the 9.4. Ok, so know my head has been removed from my ass , 2003, i love stout, its probably my favorite as long as its imperial, i still dont like that oatmeal and cream shit, but this is fucking great.

Nice brew, very nice.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"
1040,"2002-12-08",4.2,"OK, time to re-rate.  Tried it again, and the first bottle was obviously damaged in some way.  This beer has a rich dark brown head over an extremely dark body, very pretty.  The aroma is rather subdued, without the huge burnt/roasted notes I expected.  The flavor, however, is great; milk-chocolate balances well with coffee notes that are more reminiscent of Kahlua than most cups of joe.  It is very thick and somewhat creamy on the tongue.  Overall, a very good imperial, which means its an incredible beer.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","gthank"
1040,"2002-12-08",4.2,"Absolutely black opaque with a dark tan head that is about what you expect from the style. Alcohol is stronger on the nose than some of the other imperial stouts.

Great beer.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
1040,"2002-12-07",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2005 Early Summer 2004 release (sampled January 2005): significant small bubbled chocolate coloured foam.  Body is blacker than any night I have seen in ages (the sodium glow of the city never dies)  The dark head is retentive, but not sticky.  Dark roasted black cherry aroma with subtle alcohol and an almost overwhelming coffee presence.  Dusty Bakers chocolate mix with raisins and a touch of anise to round an aroma that grows on me and is at its best only after it warms.  Creamy, melted chocolate palate  barely seems carbonated, but it works pretty well here: the smoothness across the tongue delivers the warming alcohol, lightly bitter chocolate and sweet (though darkly roasted) coffee beans wonderfully.  Though this one seems a step or two up from the 2002 (creamier, more velvety mouth feel, more dark chocolate bitterness all enhanced by the coffee), this still isnt top on my list of Imperial Stouts. 8/4/8/4/16

Late spring 2002 release (sampled early December 2002): poured with a massive inspiring brown head. . . Aroma filled with alcohol, raisins, tiny bits of chocolate and a slight roastedness.  Average flavour all around: roasted chocolate, malt, and some subtle hops.  Finish full of alcohol, with none of the flavours lingering for even a second.  Stone had some high expectations to fill, and this one didnt quite live up to them like its brothers have, but a great beer all the same.

1040,"2002-12-07",3.8,"Spring 2002 in 22oz Bottle.  The pour appeared thick resulting in a black beer with slight hints of red and a dark brown head.  The aroma is interesting, sort of sour, not much roastedness coming through.  At first the flavors seem almost nonexistent, but if you hold the beer in your mouth for a while, they really come out.  A touch of sour (almost like a milk stout), sweet fruit, plenty of roasted malt, a touch of chocolate, slight alcohol, and a decent hop finish.  It all grew on me as I drank more.  This is a damn fine beer, but lacked the brashness I have come to expect from Stone.  Not my favorite for the style, but certainly nice to drink.  Many thanks again to Racegoer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
1040,"2002-12-06",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 9, 2003 Spring 2002 Release in a 22oz bottle: Pours a jet black color with a small, tan head that does not linger. Funky, very nutty, somewhat sour aroma with a strange fruitiness I am not familiar with. Full bodied and very thick, with hints of coffee, roasted malts, alcohol, and a slight sourness in the flavor. However, the sourness recedes as your tastebuds adjust. A good Imperial stout, but not my favorite offering from Stone. 
2003 22 oz Bottle: Jet black color with a small, brown head. Light malty aroma with some hop and alcohol notes. Full body with a very rich and creamy mouthfeel. The flavor lacks the sourness of last years. Wonderfully balanced between hop, malt, chocolate, anise, and licorice flavors. The finish is long and full of chocolate malts. Yummy. Much better than the bottle of last year's I had.","Greenville, South Carolina, USA","Uglyradio"
1040,"2002-12-05",2.7,"UPDATED: APR 8, 2008  Notes of dark cherry, yeast, and milk chocolate.  Wonderfully balanced, with a roasted edge of harshness, but not enough to counter the massive chocolate character. Lush and velvety on the palate. Flavors are full of toffee, almonds, and milk chocolate.  Finishes moistly full with a relentless onslaught of milk chocolate and slight roast astringency. Just awesome. Post-2007 bottlings are a drastic change from previous batches. Take the sharp alcohol, for instance, or the thinned out body which is now extremely sugary and littered with flabby fruitiness, dull malts, and no malt softness or fullness whatsoever. Yet another dime-a-dozen Imperial Stout utterly lacking  in the finesse department. Used to be pretty solid, but more than a few ounces of this in one sitting are more than enough.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

1040,"2002-11-29",3.8,"I feel almost let-down. Stone on the label is usually a bond, and although this certainly wasnt bad, it wasnt the usual high quality i expect. The aroma was pleasant exuding chocolate and roastiness. The body resembled a dark morass crowned by a rich brown head. The flavor began pleasant with the chocolate and roastiness but then this sour/vinegar flavor cuts in and ruins the flavor development. I cant imagine (judging from reviews and my past experiences with Stone) that this was intentional or the result of carelessness. Still, I feel like something happened with this batch that wasnt supposed to.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Jake Barnes"

Wow, I'm really taken aback by the richness of this beer, but it is really fantastic. Lacks a bit in head and lace but more than makes up for it in taste and palate.

This brew, the Cantillons and Southampton Baltic Porter were all best in show. The 2004 version is the the best I have tasted yet. Loads more chocolate and more mellowed hops this time around. Higher score awarded !...
This beer rocks!
The aroma is of dark, roasted nuts, roasted malt and alcohol. Hints of espresso and dark fruits.
This imperial pours as slow and thick as unrefined oil. The small, light brown head is quickly diminishing. A menacing looking beer. It has no hue, even when held up to a halogen bulb. Just BLACK.
The flavor is heavy on malt, butter, cream, cocoa and alcohol up front. Lightly sweet and pungent and moderately bitter on the backside.
Full-bodied. Lively carbonation with a syrupy mouthfeel. The long finish is slightly alcoholic, bitter and sweet, while leaving the mouth as dry as a bone moments later. Excellent imperial stout. I love this beer. Thanks go out to herbjones for this one.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

1040,"2002-10-30",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 19, 2005 No, this is the blackest darkest head Ive ever seen on a beer.  Head quickly returns to its home inside the deep muky glass.  Aroma is initially lightly hoppy, with some but not a ton of sweet malt aroma.  The first sip and the third sip and even the 5th sip are not this beers finest.  Even coming out of the beer fridge at 50F is not warm enough for this beer.  Patience patience, a amazing beer is lurking, waiting to pounce.  Then as if out of nowhere the coffee flavors begin to flow with deep malt complexity.  Hops keep things in check.  An excellent beer and a great beer to spend an evening with.  Im taking my last sip now after an hour and a half with it, and while the alcohol nose comes on at the end, the deep roastiness and coffee flavors ward it off and win in the end.

1040,"2002-10-29",3.5,"this dark mahogany pour has startling mass and viscosity. it appears so dense that surely just one more ounce of malt would cause it to congeal like a hockey puck. a head appeared only briefly, but like a masked gunman, it made an indelible impression on the witness: it bloomed like an automobile airbag, portabello brown, then carved lovely archipelegos of lace on the glass so rigid that ill need a wire brush to scoure them off.  likewise, the aroma is so thick its nearly visible, a fog of scent-drenched molecules in a hypnotic and lugubrious dance of competing olfactory messages. to picture the aroma: pile your holiday fireplace high with logs of licorice, slathered with vegemite, marinated in molasses -and ignite this sodden slag with vodka and let it burn, baby, burn. let it burn all winter in fact, stoking the conflagration with whiskied raisins, with charcoal peatbog bricks and probably oxblood.  whatever gummy gelatinous mass of resin that can be scraped off the inside of the chimney is your beer. theres enough blackened slag in every bottle to mold a truck tire.   the taste is barleywine sweet, a milkshake of molasses, cabernet and brown sugar spun in a blender with a loaf of pumpernickel and a delicate note of open pit coal mine. i fought off a charitable impulse to donate some of it to our local highway department to fill some pitted rural county roads, but i drank it and gained six pounds. it gets credit for sheer corpulence, but it aint my cup of sludge.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"

Quite possibly the prettiest beer I have ever poured. 2/3 oily black evilness under 1/3 beautiful dark brown head. Aroma of dark chocolate and anise. Amazingly rich and complex flavor consisting of coffee, cloves, chocolate, and lots of other stuff I couldnt wrap my brain around. This is not a beer, this is an experience.

Flavor knocked me over - oh why did I share this...it must be truly love. Wonderful Chocoate-flavor, just like my favorite Scharfenberger-Chocolate-Sauce. Also roasted coffee.

Pivo ""Thats a Yogi_Beera-Beer!"" Yeeeeh, right on pivo, true. And I havent given a 5.0 until now. If this beer doesnt deserve a 5.0 no beer deserves it!

Ahhh the RERATE makes it a 4.8 - but oh well! Thanks Saarlander for sending me one of my all time favorite beers!

1040,"2002-09-17",4.4,"A very high caliber stout! Screams with tons of flavor.  Truely a stout that speaks out loud.  Sinister, strong, powerful, with a calmitous aura permeating from the brew.  The label is an excellent portayal of the feeling I get when I am drinking the black liquifaction of malt and hops. The initial yeasty aroma (the only negative I can say about the beer) quickly dissipates to a caramel chocolate spicey aroma. The initial taste is a bit sour and tangy but not overbearing. Semi-sweet, spicy, with nutty alcoholic flavors (port, brandy, rum all seem to come to mind)  kick in.  The alcohol content (9.5%) becomes more noticeable as you continue. The brews strong finish and the excellent lacing are a major plus.  Thanks jcalabre for the opportunity to make this my 100th beer!","Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania, USA","ARMed"

About as viscous as a beer can be. Rich, bready aroma with undertones of chocolate and coffee that are so soft that it almost betrays this monsters appearance. The flavors are as rich as this beer is dark. Cocoa and espresso dance across the palate with a finish that is ever so silky smooth.

1040,"2002-08-11",4.4,"Appearance certainly belies this beers character.  Opaque ebony, with a light tan, rather thin head composed of very fine bubbles.  Roasty, cocoa-malt in the aroma along with some surprisingly strong yeast and a bit of alcohol.  Malt profile manages to usher in quite a few characteristics; some molasses, an estery fruitiness, highly roasted coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, and some pleasing spiciness as well.  Flavor possesses far more subtlety than I had imagined.  Hops are here towards the finish, but dont contribute enough bitterness to distract from the expertly blended malt flavors.  Hops do lend a nice spicy note, however.  Sweetness becomes more evident in the aftertaste, and as the beer warms.  Served at 55-60 F, as suggested by the bottle itself.  Body and palate are on the viscous side, but are not overpoweringly heavy by any means.  Cool silver metallic paint used for the silkscreened bottle, too!

Down to the review ... 
Dark body, thick brown foam. Fruity grapey aroma at first, some roasted malt but keeps a sweet fruitiness.
Creamy almost buttery feel, a little burnt and charred around the edges. Roasted chocolaty towards the end. Some hoppiness towards the end but never really bitters or spoils the essential purpose of this style. Greg told me it may compare to Victorys Storm King, but the hop in that one was a little too adventurous for a nightcap. This one is much better, incredibly complex but remaining sweet, comforting and halucigenic while making me question my own spelling. A fruitiness that has no purpose in this style.","California, USA","BeerLimey"

This time around It was slightly better.... maybe its a little young and I will have to wait , but it still isnt one of th best.  The flavors were more cohesive than my last 2004.  I will rerate again in hopes of having the longest rating of all time. Rerate-  2004---What a huge dissapointment. I picked up a case of this brew because it is one of my alltime favorites.  The alcohol is different and the beeer is a lot different as well..  Sure its 1% stronger and I wonder if they use the same recipe ore not because this one doesnt even compare to the brew from before.  This brew poured the same , looked the same, but the flavor was off.. sure the alcohol was less noticable, but the flavors where completely off.  I sorta feel that the 2004 edition should have its ratings because what came before was heaven.  This is not even in the top 100 or top 20 imperial stouts.  I am done ranting and raving...sorry.

Original rating: My new fave.  Tan head, utterly opaque black color.  Complex smell: Alcohol, sweetness, a tad bit of fruitiness?  The alcohol didnt come out in the taste for me at all, very smooth for the alcohol content.  The balance of roasted coffee and sweetness is absolutely perfect in all ways.

Nose has a deep roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate aroma, toasted grains and a sugary sweetness, the start is rich in malt, sweet with the top as full as they get.

1040,"2002-03-19",4.8,"This is a big beer, high in alcohol (9.47% alcohol by volume) that pours with a deep, red-black color and produces a very thin brown colored head.

Well, this is a big, dark, heavy and aromatic stout that smells of treacle, blueberries, chicory coffee and anise. It is strong and thick, but not quite as viscous as old motor oil.

1040,"2001-12-28",4.1,"This is something you have with a friend and taste with three. I liken it to the style of their 5th Anniversary IPA: Solid character; Hard, but clean bitterness. Palate changed four or five times from the end of the front through to the finish. Usually found fresh in LA. Alcoholic finish lingers,  supplemented by a sweet, tapering background. Cool, but not warm is best for this puppy.","California, USA","adamlau"
1040,"2001-12-07",4.0,"Just a huge beer!  Big sweet, roasted flavors with the big alcohol content apparent.  I made this my first choice of the evening because of the high alcohol.  A slightly sour, but roasty aroma.  This beer is on the sweet side with not much hops to overpower the malt and alcohol.  In the big bomber bottle, youll probably want just one for the evening.","Acworth, Georgia, USA","billb"
1040,"2001-11-11",4.5,"Pure black color with minimal brown, creamy head.  Sensational aroma of light licorice, mocha, coffee, brandy, all combined in a sweet, alluring almalgam of olfactory delight.  The flavor starts with a bit of roasted coffee, then chocolate, caramel, nuttiness and then a high-beam of alcohol and a well-hopped finish through the after-taste.  This beer is insanely thick and full-bodied, you have to taste it to believe it.  Certainly the best Imperial Stout Ive had, far and away.  Stout lovers need to put this on their Christmas wish-list.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
1040,"2001-10-22",4.5,"Pratically no head. Aroma: chocolate, coffee, hazelnut and carajillo. Full-bodied with a nice long finish. Very impressive and delicious.","SWITZERLAND","Rutzicka"

1040,"2001-09-16",4.6,"STRONG!!  Every taste that is characteristic to Imperial Stouts is amplified in this big 9.47% beer.  The malt, the roast and the alcohol are just perfect!  (for me...!)","Wisconsin, USA","Got Stout?"
1040,"2001-01-07",4.4,"fine long lasting head, very very deep mocha aroma; flavor: roasty coffee, very strong; aftertaste: very long, slight bitter - great beer but may be a little bit too uniforme","Bienne, SWITZERLAND","Bov"
