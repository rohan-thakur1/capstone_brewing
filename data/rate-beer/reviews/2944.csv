2944,"2014-10-03",3.8,"750 ml bottle, 30.04.15-5 stamped on the back label. Served in a Prairie Teku glass, the cider pours a hazy straw gold color with pretty much no head at all. It smells like green apples, oak and some funk. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but theres also some earthiness and lemon peel noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, its a bit coating with low carbonation. I admit that I havent tried many ciders, but I liked this one.

2944,"2014-09-10",3.8,"In short: A pale Sidra with strong funk. Funky!
How: From the wood barrel at Sagardoetxea, Astigarraga Spain.
The look: Cloudy yellow-ish body with almost no head.
To me a typical Sidra is: Funky aroma of medium intensity with many light color fruits in the back (not just apples). Body is medium in size, a texture that is both juicy and doughy and with minimal carbonation. Taste is a lot less apple-forward than a regular cider with apples but also various light color tropical/citrus/exotic fruits. Yeast presence accompanied by a bready sensation. Typical Sidras have a mild sourness and ends with a mild-medium acidic bite. Thirst quenching and also a bit nourishing. 
In long: Paler color than the typical Sidra with flavors that are mostly as above except with a stronger funk presence, and I love funk. A funky Sidra is basically like an infected regular cider, and I just love infection, theres not a single penis enlargement weblink I havent clicked.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Pours very hazy, very pale, & very still.

The aroma is earthy with plenty of tart fruit. Its got a bit of apple character and a lot of dusty cellar type of stuff going on. 

The flavor is super tart, almost bracingly (but enjoyably) acidic. Its got a fair amount of apple skin, and apple flesh with some earthy minerallity. 

Pretty cool stuff.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

Very hazy pee yellow in color, no head of course (I tried the traditional method of pouring but I was afraid to go deep). Aroma is only mildly sweet apple, very light like a slightly sweet Granny Smith. That has the tart aspect, lactic (milky tart). Nice long tart finish on the aroma. Flavor is very tart in the finish. Lots of musky apple yet all dry with a mineral feel from the a stronger than expected carbonation. Long tart Granny Smith apple. Light feel to the thing.
