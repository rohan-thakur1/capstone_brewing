Appearance: Welp, its black. What did you expect? Decent lacing, nothing special.

Smell: Ash. Smoke. Chocolate.

Taste/feel: Like the smell... tastes like ground up bricks, soil, smokey ash, roastiness, and a bit of chocolate. That should sound disturbing -- and it was disturbing to my dad and sister -- but its what I thought the beer would taste like, and I enjoyed it. The smoke/ash flavor isnt massive, but its definitely there, and the chocolate/coffee flavors follow. The feel is a bit thin for my liking, but it does make this a very drinkable beer.

Another tasty brew from Shorts. Im not too sure I like this more than their Black Diamond, which is a pretty similar beer, but its still one that Id like to have again when I want a dark beer thats not quite a stout or a porter.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

Pours a very dark brown with a single-finger tan head that sticks around for a bit before fading and leaving a bit of light lacing. The nose has a bit of light roast and a bit of dark fruit as well. Mild anise character. The flavor has a moderate amount of roast along with some sweet malt. Dark fruit and cherry come through a bit, along with some slight black licorice.

The taste seems to begin with a thin layer of astringent like tartness with dark to burnt malts, sweet black licorice, earthy and a sense of yeastiness filling in toward the finish.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4380,"2010-06-23",3.7,"12 oz. bottle - deyholla hooking it up; pours clear dark cola brown; 1"" foamy tan head fading quickly to thin film; caramel, licorice, dry chocolate and ashy malt on the nose; light, crisp mouthfeel with a dry sweetness and light roast; chocolate and dry malt with sticky dry finish and lingering licorice sweetness; easy to drink with crisp, clean flavor profile","Seattle, Washington, USA","SuzyGreenberg"
4380,"2010-06-12",3.9,"Thanks to Northernbrews.  Aroma of coffee, chocolate and strong roast.  Flavor is more of that strong roast and cocoa.  Almost reminds me more of a brown ale than a black beer.  Very good and roasty.","Orlando, Florida, USA","GodOfThunder"
4380,"2010-06-06",3.6,"Thanks Jdubfl for the share.
Pours dark brown with thin tan head. 
Aroma and flavors,  dark chocolate and roasted malts, hints of coffee with a lingering dark fruit bitterness coupled with some grains.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
4380,"2010-06-06",3.5,"Thanks to the Tampa Crew for sharing.  Pours brown with a tan head.  Nose is roast, spice, chocolate, licorice, a hint of smoke, and dark stuff.  Flavor is some dry roasted coffee along with the flavors in the aroma.  Light to medium body and very surprising for a Schwarz.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
4380,"2010-06-04",3.3,"This Shorts beer has a black-brown pour (it is a dark ruby when held up to a light) with a one to two finger tan head that recedes to a broken cover and ring after a few minutes, and left some lacing on the glass as I drank, 

there were aromas of dark caramel, dark toast, dry chocolate, roasted malt, licorice and a dark honey sweetness with a little vanilla, 

the beer had flavors of dark bread, licorice, some roasted malt sweetness and little notes of dry bitter chocolate, 
finish has barely a bite to it but there is a little bitterness, licorice and earthy mint run along on the palate after each drink, 

has a medium mouth feel, 

I thought this beer had more licorice and sweetness than the other Schwarzbiers I had tried, I do not mind a little licorice but more than that is too much for me, so, my rating will reflect how much I enjoyed this beer, its not the beer, it is me, if you like licorice, you will more than likely prefer this beer more than I.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"
4380,"2010-06-03",3.7,"Black pour with a loose tan head.  Lots of deeply roasted malt, with hints of licorice, tobacco, and coffee.  The flavor follows through from the aroma but with a more pronounced licorice note, some spicy hops on the finish with a clean lager crispness and a lasting bitterness.  Oily medium body with moderate carbonation.","Berkley, Michigan, USA","punkrkr27"
4380,"2010-05-30",3.6,"12oz bottle as an extra from Attitude Brew.  Pours deep cola brown with a nice frothy beige head, decent lacing.  Nice roasted malts and toffee with faint herbal hop notes.","San Diego, California, USA","Snojerk321"
4380,"2010-05-28",3.6,"Another awesome beer shared by Timbo! Pours a pure black color with a large brown head. The aroma is sweet chocolates, some hops for sure, caramel and toasted malts. The flavor is a really well-made Schwarzbier; chocolates, rich earthy malts, caramel, very flavorful. I could drink a ton of these.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
4380,"2010-05-23",3.7,"out of the white-labeled and white-capped bottle comes a black beer, not stout opaque but certainly porter black.  tiny barely mentionable beige head circles atop, and clean caramel and burnt sugars float around in the aroma with classic schwarz lager yeast. molasses and slightly green balanced finish; neither cloying nor dry and no perceptible alcohol heat. an uncommon style to take to market, but its sweet and clean enough to appeal. pricier at $11 a sixer, but an enjoyable beer nonetheless.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"
4380,"2010-05-22",3.3,"Bottle. Pours black with a small light brown head. Aroma has notes of dark grains with some roast and a bit of caramel. Flavor is full of dark grains and caramel with a bit of a roasted kick towards the finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
4380,"2010-05-18",3.5,"A pretty average beer to me.  One of my favorite style,s but this one just has all of the typical features of the style without anythin being wonderful.  Slight head, nice dark color, a static, carmel malt profile without much depth.","Sylvania, Ohio, USA","smooch"
4380,"2010-05-13",3.1,"This poured a black as night color with a beige head. Aroma was grassy hops, some lightly toasted malt, and some other things. Flavor was light bodied toasted malts, very light chocolate, and light german grassy hops. Typical Schwartz but nothing special.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
4380,"2010-05-11",2.5,"Pretty black color is this beers only claim to fame. Bland!!! No tastes or aromas that are worth describing. No hops anywhere. Thin body and head.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","milewide"
4380,"2010-05-09",4.0,"Very dark brown pour -- almost black.  Very subtle tan head.  Aroma of chocolate, licorice, light roast.  Some dark fruits.  Flavor of licorice, dark chocolate, oreos.  I detect a bit of creaminess which makes this taste like an ice cream sandwich.  Really delicious.  Full mouthfeel, thick texture, nice carbonation.  Finishes with chocolate wafers.  Easily my fav schwarz ever.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
4380,"2010-05-07",3.6,"Bottle. Best schwartzbier Ive had. Porteresque. Black pour with beige head. no infection here. Was worried considering all their problems as of late. Aroma of roasted coffee, chocolate, grass. Rich flavor. Bitter, dry chocolate. Coffee, roasted malt. Like a Porter or dry stout. Nicely done","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","badnewsbeers"
4380,"2010-04-26",3.7,"Sampled at Schlafly Repeal.  Enjoyed with Vyvvy and Terminus.  A very nice black lager with some fun stuff going on.  Gobs of roasted accents reign supreme.  A bit of smoke.  A great looking beer and one that has some ornery attitude to it.  Very enjoyable and a fun beer to sample.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
4380,"2010-04-25",4.0,"tap at repeal prohibition festival at Schalfly in Maplewood, MO.  probably my favorate beer of the festival for sure!  pours deep brown/mahogony hue in the light with a soapy beige head.  very nice looking beer!  chocolate, nuts (almonds) with a hint of vanilla and roast on the nose. flavors of dark chocolate dominate along with roast, char, and nutty notes.  slightly chalky feel on the palate, but that didnt detract-pretty common for this style.  Very nise for the style-better than Black Bavarian and reminds me alot of Rio Salados version way back when it was around.  i dig it!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
4380,"2010-04-24",4.4,"Tasted 4/17/10.  Schlaflys Repeal of Prohibition Festival.  Dark with an opaque hue.  Great dark roasted malts with an almost burnt quality, which I loved!  All malts in the palate.  But very full, rich and delicious.  The roasty aspect lingers in the finish.  Very full and complex with a great flavor and mouthfeel.  This was my favorite of the festival!  Wonderfully done!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","sneagrams3"
4380,"2010-04-23",3.8,"On draft, Schlafly Beer Fest.  Was at first quite skeptical when I saw ""dark"" and ""spring seasonal"" in the description.  One smell and one taste later, I am all over this great beer.  Like the ""Hangin Frank"" this shows the skills of the Shorts brewers.  Roasty, licorice, coffee, all the things youd say about a great stout BUT much lighter in body while still weighing in at 5.7%.  If I lived in Northern Michigan, this would be in my regular Spring lineup.  Excellent!","Dallas, Texas, USA","dukefan"
4380,"2010-04-19",4.8,"Without hesitation, I can assure you, this is the greatest beer I have ever had. It is dark and rich and contains a mysterious richness without falling into a bitter finish. If youre into creamy, dark beer, you must try Sustenance.","Michigan, USA","watchman146"
4380,"2010-04-18",3.6,"(draught at Schlafly Repeal of Prohibition) black with tan head. Roast malt aroma Flavor is roast malt, hints of coffee, but the lighter body of a lager than a stout.","Manchester, Missouri, USA","kwoeltje"
4380,"2009-10-24",2.6,"Almost black in color. Shared at the CL Flaming Fury release.  Some light chocolate, roast, and some sour cherry in the aroma, with touches of funk.  Taste has some roast, light chocolate, and sour cherry, funky - and brett.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
4380,"2009-07-28",3.5,"5oz sample at brewery 7/2/09-Pours a light black with ruby tints with a small tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate.

4380,"2008-08-05",3.8,"Draft at MBGF Summer08. Poured  cloudy black color with medium brown creamy head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Medium to heavy roasted coffee and sweet malt aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture. Medium to heavy flavor of toasted sweet malt with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate to long duration. Interesting solid brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
4380,"2008-07-30",3.8,"2008 MiBGF: Very deep brown, nearly black with a very good creamy head. The aroma has notes of prune, walnut, grassy hops, slight smoke and roast, minty and yeasty. The taste has a nice malty, fruity, and herbal balance. Slightly nutty and bready upon the finish. The mouth feel is smooth and quite drinkable.
