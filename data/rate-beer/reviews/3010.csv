3010,"2012-04-01",3.2,"Tap at moto-i. Clear pour - very little color. Nose is pear and honeydew. Taste is similar - seems fairly subtle. Tasty.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
3010,"2009-07-12",3.7,"[On-tap at moto-i] Pours mostly clear. Aroma is very nice. Pineapple, honey dew, touch of lime, sweet tart candy, and blackberry. There is a little burn in the taste, good deal of sweetness, honey dew again, and what I assumed to be rice. Good mouthfeel and smooth. I really dont know much about sakes, but this was good, especially the aroma.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"
3010,"2009-06-01",3.7,"On tap at the brewpub on 05/31/2009. Very clear white body with no head and some light but thick legs. Light fruit and vanilla aroma with a rice background. Very sweet flavor with lots of fruit and a light fruit and vanilla finish. Medium full body with no carbonation.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","maniac"
3010,"2009-03-10",3.5,"Gold color, but Moto is so dark, it might be clear.  Anyway, we will say gold.  Light melon is perceivable in the aroma and flavor.  Standard sake flavors as well.  Fairly flavorful.  Clear.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
3010,"2009-01-12",3.7,"Sampler @ the Sake brewhouse.  Clear as water.  It has strong melon aspects for sure but that has a light creaminess to it as well.  Alcohol a bit more apparent in the flavor.  Did not seem bad or cheap, still not sure how to think of it, either well made or boring, not sure.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
3010,"2008-10-28",3.8,"On draught at the sake brewhouse in uptown, Minneapolis, MN. Pours a still, clear sake with some golden light blonde highlights. Aroma of lightly sweet mellon, a hint of floral dandelion, and even a little apple. Taste is a little smoother than the genshu like I would add a few drops of spring water to a cask strength scotch whiskey, with light flavors of apple, coconut milk, and pear. Finish is silky, with a semi-sweet light pear aftertaste that makes way for a mild white pepper and alcohol burn finish. A little heavier texture than most other namasakés Ive tried and with more character.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
3010,"2008-10-28",3.4,"Crisp and clear with a floral aroma and solid mellons, though not the honeydew on the first sake.  The mouthfeel was incredibly thick and stood-out.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
3010,"2008-10-28",3.2,"Clear.  Aroma of orchids and melons.  Solid floral taste.  Very thick and almost viscious mouthfeel.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
