Tropical fruits, mango, peach, papaya, marmalade, melon. Taste is medium to strong sweetness and low to medium bitterness. Really intense. Full bodied, fine carbonation, texture is sticky, oily, like a juice. Finish is very very long, spices, fruity and bitter. Was my first DIPA in London and.. What a DIPA!","Milano, ITALY","Tinaccio"

Taste of sweet citrus, dank hops, ripe orange, stone fruits and a tropical feel to it. Lots and lots of hops in this and a somewhat sweet outcome.

Smooth airy dry palate, decent fine carbonation. Light dry sweetish malts. Nibbly hop spice that builds in strength. Chalky minerals. More hop spice. Mellow tropical fruits. Little orange and lemon. Tangy bitterness. Some orange peel on the finish. Bitter linger with that strong hop spice almost burning. Seeing the scores for this one I was anticipating this one hugely, but it never reached the stratosphere. Its a very good DIPA but no wow factor for me. Strange!",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"

1180,"2017-02-26",3.6,"Huge hop, haze bomb. Incredible Aroma of tropical fruits. I can see why people love this but for me the lingering, almost unbalancing bitterness took this away from a top class double IPA for me.","Surrey, ENGLAND","Gramoit"

More pine, grass, bitterness intensifying, soft carbonation, full bodied, a touch harsh in the finish. Very nice IIPA, fantastic aroma, would even say more intense and better than v12 but not quite balanced in taste and palate.

1180,"2017-02-22",4.0,"February 2017 - Bottle share at CBC Islington for the Matteo Farewell tasting as Cloudwater Birthday DIPA. Huge thanks to Matteo for sourcing this insta-whale! Pours a dirty matte orange, hazy and opaque, foamy off-white head, full lacing. Aroma is quite light, some peach, dank and oniony. A bit muted. Body is smooth with soft carbonation. Taste has light peach, straw, rubbery, floral hops, some petrol vibes, touch more bitterness than you often get in NE IPAs. I like it a lot. Maybe theres some variability - took my time with it but couldnt get the fireworks other have. Still, its great. (4.0)","Richmond, Greater London, ENGLAND","The_Osprey"
