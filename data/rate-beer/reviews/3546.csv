3546,"2017-06-02",4.0,"On tap @ Tørst. This is quite a cloudy looking one, dark strawish yellow in colored and a nice medium sized quite lacing whole white head on the top. At first I got traces if cabbage on the nose, that quickly went away leaving a mild tangy clementine zesty fruitiness combined with lime-onade, straws, some hints of grains and a little olive saltiness. Really interesting, different and good! It has a lovely flavor this. Mild lemonic with lime, sweet lime zest and more of that clementine orangey fruitiness found in the aroma.

Sour lemon upfront and turns to citrus and melon. In fact quite a bit of orange citrus through the base of the brew.

3546,"2015-07-03",4.0,"Purchased from One Stop Market on a brisk Wednesday afternoon. $11.00 for the 750 mL bottle. Enjoyed at home. 
 To long-stemmed red whine glass, it pours a partially cloudy unmellow yellow with which a snowy white head 1 pinky nail in length stood. 
 Aromas of papaya, clementine zest, mixed Belgian cultures, lemon sage,well minerals, saltwater taffy, unripe apricot, and aged hops. Tastes much the same with the addition of wheat grain, sweat, and plastic. A sneakily presented touch of kitchen salt and candle wax experienced by swallow. Buttery in consistency.The tartness is unexpectedly just right: bordering on sour, the orange note hanging off to the side, ultimately gives it the push it needed. And everything is precisely where it needs to be. Nothing is out of place; but after more than a few minutes of allowing the Gose to sit in my glass, the mouthfeel had taken on a rather, lets say, ""sluggish"" texture similar to that of a week-old yogurt. For $11.00, this could have been a surely regrettable decision; however, I dont t honestly think Ive ever tried a bad gose before. Im not even joking: there have been unremarkable, boringly stiff examples of the styles, but never one Id happily pour down the drain. This must be my style, then. 
Its not only that this was dry-hopped and brewed with oranges, but also fermented with a mixed wild culture, AND conditioned on American white oak. Theres a lot going on, but it thankfully worked. I dont think luck had anything to do with its deliciousness : ""Super Going"" was carefully planned and masterfully brewed. The flavors hardly linger, so I was forced to continue taking little dainty sips to get a decent feeling of what I was tasting.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"

3546,"2015-06-22",3.0,"June 2015 bomber drunk 6/22/15Absolutely cloudy pour, despite the beer resting cold for a week and a careful pour. But the large white head sits atop and slowly recedes to a good covering. Pale golden with white gold hues.Lactic acid in the nose alerts to the acidity while fruity hops add a rarely seen element to the ""style"". It works well with the sour acids, bringing forth dry pineapple, mango and even passion fruit hints and adding lots of complexity. WIth some warming, however, the orange zest and light oak emerge, somewhat harrying the otherwise lighter, more playful hop and lactic notes. Seems like a bit more sweetness than Id expect, based on the nose, though perhaps thats just the richness from the oak.The flavor, unfortunately, is dominated by the orange zest. After Night Shift orange zested the hell out of their much anticipated Cape Codder weisse, it was about a full year before the heavy handed orange zest finally faded and allowed the cranberries (which were supposed to be the center piece of the beer) to shine. Point being, Im going to half to put a moratorium on brewers using orange zest, as obviously they dont know their limits. Anyways, behind the orange zest youve got some fresh, heavily woody and toasty oakiness as well as light lactic sourness and grapefruity hops. The orange comes back on the finish and lingers. It dosent taste bad, just way too much of it.Clean though, and so nice to try a Grimm beer not from the evil Paper City. As I said with Rainbow, I think their beers are incredibly ambitious and it would be nice to see what they could do with a classic example of a Belgian style. Its good to push the envelope, but their beers have a lot more going on than they need to, most of the time. Furthermore, this beer could be a good deal more dry and crisp on the end. The hop flavor is nice, but this could use a good deal more bitterness from the hops or acidity from the lacto.As an orange shandy though, this is near a 5.0","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Cloudy and looks like a shandy. Has a sharp hop bitterness in the finish which is nice but almost more resiny and adds to the funk vs tropical hops which I think would compliment more. That is my impression. I like it and it is complex, but it is a bit odd and doesnt entirely work. The more I drink the more the combo of orange and dry hop is like grapefruit with the bitter finish. Bump it up a tenth. EDIT: having again and it is more like a lactic sour with the hops and orange creating a great grapefruit character. Really unique and delicious.
