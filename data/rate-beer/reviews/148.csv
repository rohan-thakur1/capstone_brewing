148,"2015-06-05",4.1,"sample from 2012 vintage, thanks tommy! tasted side by side with their regular ice cider. clear bright golden orange pour with some nice legs. lightly buttery and salty caramel, spicy and sweet golden raisins, apple sauce with brown sugar, honey and woodsy maple syrup sweetness, warming and tingling. flat carbonation, medum-full body - syrupy; sweet but never cloying spicy-woodsy finish. spices are subdued compared to regular version. pretty solid but i prefered the regulars uniqueness!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
148,"2015-05-31",4.1,"2 oz sample from bottle (375 ml). Vintage 2012.

Appearance: Clear bright golden with some legs. A bit darker than their regular ice cider. 

Aroma: Yellow pears, caramel, apples, mild spiciness and honeyed notes. Not too boozy.

Taste: Medium to heavy sweetness, but never cloying. Moderate acidity. Yellow pears forward, apples, light spiciness and a bit of alcohol (but definitely not enough to consider it boozy).

Palate: Medium to full body. Thick and oily mouthfeel. Yellow pears finish with a mouth coating sweetness. Light warmth. 

Overall: Tasty and complex ice cider. Its a top tier ice cider, but it was overshadowed by their regular ice cider from the same vintage which was mindblowing. On one side, this one has the freshness from their cryoconcentrated ice cider (but without the massive tropical fruits presence) and on the other side it has the complexity of a cryoextracted ice cider and while he is doing very well in both catagories (freshness and complexity), he isnt stellar in any. Its not every day that the cryoconcentrated ice cider is better than cryoextracted version from the same cidery and vintage (of course its not the same apples used, but still). Definitely worth a try though.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
