1600,"2012-01-22",3.7,"Bottle. No head (still). Body is nearly colorless (faint hint of yellow). Aroma is notes of honeydew melon, oak, cedar, orange flowers, lemon zest, honey, grain/rice, alcohol. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery/silky texture, no carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic, lightly astringent. 

Ok, now this I like.  The aroma is alive with floral and fruity notes, quite attractive.  Pretty clean and well balanced in the mouth...a bit on the sweet side but plenty of acidity.  Quite good, especially in the nose.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1600,"2012-01-12",2.5,"Appearance: Nearly colorless, but there is a small, small hint of yellow.

Smell: Huh. This one smells like those powder packets from those cheap, store-brand macaroni and cheese boxes but with some ethanol wafts.

Taste: Nil sweetness with an instant twinge of alcoholic heat and that underlying cheese powder taste.

Mouthfeel: Body remains light.

Overall: Do I have bats in the belfry? Is it just me on this cheese thing??","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

1600,"2009-09-21",2.6,"This bottled sake from a bottle shop poured a extremely small sized head of frothy medium sized clear colored bubbles that were very quickly diminishing and left behind a transparent uncarbonated clear with a light yellow hued body and no lacing. The aroma was alcohol and polished rice. The smooth mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a burning alcohol aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of alcohol and polished rice. A typical alcohol burn sake, OK just nothing special.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

1600,"2008-07-02",3.8,"Sipped chilled.  Poured crystal clear like water with a slight yellow tint to it.  The aroma was clean with no alcohol.  Some rice and fruit.  Notes of pear and honeydew.  The flavor had a semi-sweet start and was very smooth and clean.  The alcohol was well hidden and there was a good dryness.  Tasty stuff and went very well with my sushi dinner.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
1600,"2008-05-01",3.3,"300mL bottle from State Line Liquors, Elkton, MD. Poured absolutely clear with no head; about as exciting as a sake can look. Nice lacing. Aroma of rice, nuts, melon, plum and some alcohol. Sweet flavor at first; with some tropical fruit and nuts complimenting the rice. Initial sweetness gives way to rubbing alcohol flavor and a long, alcohol burn.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","kkearn"
1600,"2008-04-11",3.5,"300ml bottle. Nearly water like pour with just the faintest touch of gold. I mean really faint. Faint fruity aroma. Perhaps some kiwi and melon. Koji and rice. Simple but inoffensive. Bright fruit on the tongue initially. Followed by a pleasant woody dryness. The 15% is  barely detectable. Medium bodied and quite firm on the palate for a sake. Finishes quite dry.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"

1600,"2007-10-07",4.0,"Clear with a yellowish tint. Aroma is not very pronounced, some butter, fruity, maybe raisins or plums. Velvet butter flavor, light honey sweetness. A flavorful sake with almost no alcohol profile. Subtly delicious and refined.","Somerville, Massachusetts, USA","DrGonzo"

1600,"2007-08-03",3.5,"Sampled at The Cellars Wine & Spirits wine tasting. Pours a clear, still (with a touch of golden yellow) beverage. Aroma of some sweet pears, light cotton candy, and well steamed rice. Taste is almost neutal, maybe one click towards the sweet side with flavors of pear and flowers. Finish is semi-sweet, peppery with plenty of alcohol warmth.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
1600,"2007-06-21",3.3,"Crystal clear beige color.  Definite alcohol in the nose. Kind of lightly American whiskey smell. No sweetness. Warm alcohol. Grainy taste, very warm. Lightly sweet. Like a jack and water only different. Better than the only other sake I tried. But that was a futsu shu. Good for playing weaboo. But in general I dislike the sake mouthfeel. Though thats not important.","Dothan, Alabama, USA","Rictus"
1600,"2006-11-11",3.9,"300mL Bottle: Pours an egg shell clear color, just a vague tint of beige, light rings of bubbles and thin lacing. The nose is a bit grainy with some light cotton candy, anise, rice dust and traces of koji, no alcohol. The flavor has a light impact, a sweet soft acidity and light koji notes that just skip across the palate, never lingering. A light caramel and tappioca note in the end. Nice sake for an import. Clean, fragrant, subtle flavor, very light alcohol presence and low acidity in the tail. Very approachable. Nice light melon and kiwi in the nose as it breathes a bit. I could use a bit more aggression in the nose and a bit more umami overall. I see the puckering thing austinpowers was talking about here.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1600,"2006-07-29",3.8,"Clear, chilled, with a scent of rice dough.  Definitely a ""velvet fist"" flavour with floral tones over a kick of alcohol.  Fabulous.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","starfireming"
1600,"2006-07-29",2.7,"Clear body with no tinting.  Rice and grain aroma.  Taste is rather nice, sweet with some light fruit, maybe some dough characteristics coming through.  Slight burn on the back of the tongue in the ending.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Numenor"

1600,"2006-07-04",3.1,"Purchsed at the local Co op. The body was mostly clear with a slight yellow tint. That almost seemed to be part of my imagination. The aroma was sweet and floral with some strogn alcohol burn. There was also an earthy potting soil type note. The taste was relatively mild with grass and other plant stems. There was also rubbing alcohol in the finish. A little harsh, but still a decent sipper.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
1600,"2006-04-22",3.8,"And my sake cherry is popped.  Got this at the Pioneer Coop. 300mL bottle.  Pours clear.  Aroma is very sweet with a very light fruit essence (i know that sounds dumb but thats how Im saying it).  Taste is plums and alcohol, also very sweet. Plenty of alcohol burn noted.  Very smooth, full bodied.  Like I said, its my first sake.  If most sakes taste like this, I think Ill be a fan.  Im not too big a fan of wine though, so sake is a pleasant surprise.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
1600,"2005-11-08",3.2,"Devils Night at Mullmans, bottle shared by Mullman. Clear color. Strong alcohol aroma with some pear and plum. Flavor of alcohol was also very prevalent, with some light fruitiness and a dry finish.","Nutley, New Jersey, USA","jimmack"
1600,"2005-11-04",2.6,"Devils night at Mullmans.  Pours pretty much clear like water and still.  Aroma is like vodka, paint thinner, pure ethanol, and some other fusel alcohols.  Flavor is actually very light with just a bit of sweetness, lots of alcohol, and some light honey in there like a light mead.  Very dry finish, with more alcohol.  I dont like Sake that much.  This was the perfect ""Bad Jazz""  drink (view Mullmans rating for explanation).  I didnt stay around too long after this one.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
1600,"2005-11-01",3.5,"ok Shimane, forgive me a thousand forgivenesses, but I called this ""the bad jazz"" all night before opening this split-size bottle.  the reference is from the owner of Surfer Supplies in Ocean City NJ.  whenever the shop got too many customers, he would play sad jazz to make people leave.  but this sake wasnt that bad and I wouldnt have minded having everyone stay longer for the devils night party.  the color was clear and cloudy.  aroma is earthy dirt, mild isoprpyl, and a little dried plum.  flavor is milder than expected.  starts w/ far away vodka then kicks in with heat, dried plum, and other fruit skins.  mild isopropyl finish.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","MullMan"
1600,"2005-05-04",3.6,"clear. nut aroma, strong nuttiness in the aroma. taste is upfront chocolate with a brown ale like flavor(if i had to put it in beer terms this would be the best i could do) nice smooth finish with a lingering burn, nice.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
1600,"2005-03-23",2.4,"As sakes go, this wasnt too bad but I still cant get around them.  Clear body.  Aroma was perfumy.  Some sweetness and floral.  Honey.  Texture was smooth and ample.  The flavor was still very much pure alcohol.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
1600,"2004-09-13",3.8,"This is a good Ginjo Sake.  Earthy, alcohol, and some fruit (plum)  flavor.  Finishes smooth, clean, and warming.","New Jersey, USA","beerslayer"
1600,"2004-09-01",4.0,"My first Sake.  I sampled this one starting at refrigerator temperature and let it warm.  This pours a crystal clear light shade of pewter.  The aroma is sweet and almosty fruity with a distilled spirits hint to the aroma.  More honey notes in the aroma as it warms.  The flavor is nice and hard to describe.  I almost taste a honey quality, Vodka, and a lingering saltiness and as it warms, some funky - but nice, flavor that reminds me of the sea (sort of like an Islay malt).  All very rounded and mild, blended, smooth, lingering...  A very complex beverage.  Wow, pretty cool.  Thanks Ryan at Cellars!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"
1600,"2004-07-20",4.1,"Nice clear water color.Kind of a mild over ripe fruit aroma with just a faint hint of alcohol.The flavor is very light with just a faint fruit flavor of maybe plum with the alcohol coming on only mildly towards the end,and maybe just a swift quick bite at the end.I think i could drink this stuff all day if it werent for the ABV. sneaking up on me later.Very nicely light flavored Sake that is easy to drink.Thanks go to Flipbrewer for sending another fine brew my way.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
1600,"2004-02-09",4.6,"UPDATED: SEP 4, 2005 Remarkably strong aroma, very perfumey!  Nice.  Strong flavor, as well, with lots of candyish body, and some light butteriness.  Definitely a more flavorful Ginjo with some astringency.  Im looking for the famed Shimane Prefecture tartness, written about by John Gauntner in The Sake Handbook, and can perhaps taste what hes talking about because I see a considerable amount of mouth-puckering acidity here.  Most importantly to me, the alcohol burn is very subdued.  Almost as good as the Ohtouka, but they arent really all that comparable: different types of sake entirely with Rihaku being quite aromatic, distinctive and enjoyable, with very little burn.  Like Rihaku himself, I now feel a poem coming on...","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
