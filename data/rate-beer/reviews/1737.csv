APPEARANCE: Amber, almost ruby red, dark but mostly translucent; head is off-white, swift and forms a halo around an island... AROMA: a slam of caramel with cherry, raspberry and other fruity hints; the hops are not so present, but in a lager, I am not surprised... PALATE: speaking of style, unlike any Vienna I have had--full-bodied, balanced between the teeth and the tongue, and dry--almost a winelike finish; the ABV is clearly a force... TASTE: again, the strength of a pinot noir, with caramelized malts and pepper, chocolate, and some cherry qualities as well...

Heavy medium body with a creamy texture. Slightly above normal carbonation with a touch of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish. 

The World Class flavor profile is intense, complex and a masterpiece in balance. It begins with creamy blend of toffee and caramel against a slight sweetness that has a cracker character. In the middle, a nice noble hop flavor emerges over a mild bitterness. Against a fading bitterness, a nice spicy hop character emerges that is a bit tart, a bit clove like and has a pepper aspect - outstanding. The finish is a bit dry, but also has a sweet biscuit component. A slightly tart note lingers for a bit over a receding caramel and biscuit sweetness leaving the tongue with a slight pucker.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

1737,"2014-10-15",4.9,"12 oz bottle, poured into a pint glass at approximately 40 degrees F.

A: Looks like free-flowing honey on the pour, which swells into a beautiful clear amber. Small streams of bubbles rise slowly from the bottom at the start, before dying away to leave the beer a deep amber shading towards russet. A thick head of foam forms, which slowly dies down to a cap. The lacing is minimal, but present.

S: Sweet toasted malt and caramel, wreathed around bready yeast with some faint notes of rich soil and ripe fruit.

T: Mother of god, this is a fantastic Vienna lager. The taste opens with sweet bread and lightly toasted caramel, before some hints of walnut, raisin, and pecan join in. Theres some slight bitterness from the malt, as well as an earthen, loamy bitter that offsets the sweetness just enough. Warm yeasty bread with toffee-like tinges form the finish, which lingers without overstaying its welcome.

M: A light, smooth, silky lager, with exactly the right amount of carbonation to avoid feeling flat without sparkling up too much. Just heavy enough to impart a feeling of drinking a good beer, while remaining light enough for refreshment duty.

O: I have yet to encounter another Vienna lager thats comparable to this one. Its virtually everything I could look for in this style, from the complex malt profile to the slight hop presence and the silken mouthfeel. This is a staple of my beer enjoyment.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

1737,"2014-06-20",4.1,"Transfer from BA review from 7-3-12 - 
\Poured from bottle into pint glass

Appearance  Pours a lovely amber color with a big off white head that has a wonderful retention. The head faded very slowly over time to give a good level of lacing.

Smell  The smell is heaviest in a bready and biscuit aroma. These are mixed some lighter sweet caramel a mild citrus hop aroma.

Taste  A smooth lightly roasted and bready flavor meets the tongue. This is mixed with some light nutty flavors as well as a very light caramel flavor. The carmel fades and the nuttiness gets a bit stronger as the taste advances. While these flavors transition, notes of a citrus hop also come to the tongue. At the very end, the taste bitters ever so slightly leaving a rather nice bready-lighty bitter flavor on the tongue. Very pleasing.

Mouthfeel The body of the beer is just above average in creaminesss with a carbonation level that is just below average to average. Both are great for the lighter roasted flavors, but niehter are too intense to take away from the flavors and drinkability.

Overall  One fantastic easy drinking brew with great flavors. A great drinking experience for this Vienna.","","Darkmagus82"

1737,"2014-06-05",3.5,"Reviewed from notes.
Several times poured into a pilsener and a couple times poured into a pint glass - there really wasnt much noticeable difference.
The appearance was a nice golden amber hazy sort of color with a decent one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Once the head died, there was some light stringy lacing sticking to both glasses for the most part.
The smell had a nice roasty maltiness running all about the nose. Id say it was a decent caramel of sorts that made everything seem right about it.
The taste was slightly sweet, but not bitter. It was somewhat roasty, but also a bit nutty.
On the palate, it sat about a light to medium in body with a decent sessionable quality about it.
Overall, I say this was a good Vienna Lager well worthy of having again if I ever saw it again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

1737,"2014-01-02",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2016 12oz bottle poured into an English Tulip pint glass. Buttery caramel, and fruit are the first aromatic impressions that struck me - a faint berry and/or orange citrus aroma. This gives way to a slight dampness / mildewy smell as the head recedes, but the buttery notes are present and eventually turn to a baked cookie smell. Theres also a faint roasted grain in there too. The head is a creamy, slightly yellow/brown shade, a hearty amount of which remains throughout the drink, and it leaves an abundant lacing along the glass. The head sits atop a very clear orange-brown (""deep amber"" I suppose) beer. Its mostly a sweet beer, but a mellow sweet at that.. It has some spiciness to it too - root beer comes to mind as theres maybe anise or sarsaparilla notes to it, as well as perhaps some molasses? Theres some light roasted bitterness with an ever so slight hoppy kick too, but the hops only appear at the finish. Its a astringent too. Its a medium bodied beer with a decent amount of carbonation to it - although it goes down smooth. Theres a roasted flavor that sticks around shortly, but its a mostly clean finish. The hops also contribute a slight grassy coating of the mouth, but, again, it doesnt stick around long. As it warms up, the root beer flavoring disappears and is replaced by maple syrup and butter (pancakes came to mind) with some slight burnt toast hints.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

Strong notes of nuts and nut shell open up followed by bread crusts, light citrus hops, hint of old chocolate and some toast. Solid beer.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"

The caramel that I was expecting is a minor footnote here, as is the hoppiness. Aftertaste is nuts, bread, and a bit of cinnamon. Medium bodied, chewy in texture, and soft, bubbly carbonation.

Really good job of keeping things fro getting too sweet which is easy in this kind of beer.

Overall, an amazing beer and one of the best I have ever had in the style. Definitely one to pick up when given the chance.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

1737,"2012-02-22",4.0,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/28/2009.  Served on tap in a pint glass.

Eliot Ness pours a deep burgundy color. When the draught arrived, it had a thick, taupe head, which slowly clung to the side of the glass. A residual ring and thin film remained for the life of the beer.

A nice, smooth toasted malt aroma, with a bit of spice. A light fruity hop smell is present as well.

The smooth bready malt flavor is the preliminary and most dominant flavor, nuanced by a light caramel flavor. The hop flavor itself is fairly balanced, with a light citrus flavor. A bitter aftertaste lasts just a moment. Definitely a bold lager, with exceptional balance.

Moderate carbonation, with a nice balance between the chewy malt and puckering hops feels. Very smooth.

The subtle transition between malt and hops, along with the smooth feel, make this an easy choice for a repeat.  By far the best selection for the style I have ever had.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Some fruity hops abound.  Almost smells like a mild Oak barreled Kentucky Bourbon.  The fruitiness seems to be a cross between grapes and peach.  Not for sure.  With the taste, I am again picking up the very sweet malt with some fruity, bitter tinges.  Picked up the Oak flavoring of Bourbon again.  Its mild, but in there.  Medium mouthfeel.  Nicely smooth and dry with a sophisticated alcohol warmth.  The flavor is wrapped across the palate gently.  The brew has an almost slick or oily feeling.  This is a nice little beer.

1737,"2010-08-19",3.9,"Whole Foods, DC ($10): Pours a lovely amber color (very bright and fancy looking), with a ephemeral but also quite pleasant beige head. The aroma is the weakest part of the beer being mostly caramel malts and is not so noticeable when cold, but becomes more prominent as it warms up (as is of course the course of all aromas). The palate and the taste are the true champions of this beer and I dare say that they champion quite well. The beer in your mouth goes through a few successive stages beginning with a smooth and creamy feel and some malts and then hitting some slightly bitter hops and uncovering a yeast note and finally coming to the finish, which is indeed a splendid culmination. Kind of dray aftertaste after that. Very well-balanced and nothing bad about it.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

S- Nose is of medium strength and is a perfect balance between bright citrus hops and smooth caramel malt. This is a lager?

T- Initial flavor is quite bright and is full of citrus hop flavor with a great balance of sweet caramel malt in the background. The finish is consistent with the initial flavor with just a slight touch of bitterness and maybe a hint of piny hop flavor. A mild bitterness lingers along with a lot of sweet caramel malt.

P- Low carbonation and very smooth body. Mouthfeel is exceptional for a lager.

O- This is another one that I have had available to me since I started craft beer and didnt try until now. Its wonderful-the perfect balance of citrus hops and caramel malt. Both Eliot Ness and Dortmunder are excellent lagers from Great Lakes.

1737,"2010-04-19",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Deeply bready malts, spicy hops and delicate caramel create a most efficient, slender Vienna.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A thick head of foam settles upon the clear coppery amber.
-The spicy hops provide levelled bitterness.
-This is relatively dry, like most of Great Lakes staple products as a matter of fact.
-Bubbles are quite present in the mouthfeel yet do not hinder on the drinkability.

Another freebie left over from a recent party this one was another respectable beer.  I would not hesitate to buy a pint if this were the best option and in some cases it might be around Ohio.  For the price this is a nice year round option that mixes things up from the usual ""big beer"" equation.  Recommend it to your friends who do not rate and simply want to drink good beer that they can find almost anywhere.

Aroma / Appearance - Deep ruby red the body absorbs around half the light that filters through.  Carbonated with a bubbly head it suggests positive things are to come.  The aroma reminds of a sun bleached deck that is drying out from a recent application of wood stain.  Waxy chocolate hovers the edge like a Hersheys kiss in a bowl of candy.

Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel was surprisingly full.  After spending some time enjoying that aspect I discovered a nice depth of cherry wood, chocolate, and malt balls.  The hops that come forward never dominate but complement the other flavor profiles well.  If I were to drink this regularly I think it would make a nice spring beer for when the season changes from imperial stouts to lighter lawnmower styles.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1737,"2009-11-22",3.4,"Location: 12 oz bottle from jcos, 11/22/09 


Aroma: The nose has lots of caramel, toffee, and sweet fruits, with notes of cereal/bread and earthy hops

Appearance: Pours a clear amber color with a disappearing off-white head and light lace

Flavor: Flavor is medium-high sweetness, with a bit of earthy bitterness for balance

Palate: The body is light-medium, with some lively carbonation, and a somewhat sticky mouthfeel

Overall Impression: 
Overall, this is turns out to be a well-structured and tasty beer, maybe a drop too sweet for my palate, but very good none-the-less.  One that works well as both a highly drinkable brew, and a nice example of its style.  Truly a nice beer that, that you might say even borders on being ""Untouchable"" (sorry, I couldnt resist, it was just too easy...)

1737,"2009-08-09",3.2,"Are we alone in this infinitely vast and yet tiny world we live in? Are there creepy crawlies that go bump in the night? Is Bigfoot real? Does the loch really have a Ness? I dont have the answers to those and other burning questions of mythology, but I can offer you an alternative. He is smaller than his motherly namesake, but the Eliot Ness that I hold in my hands is an amber lager from Great Lakes Brewing. Based in Cleveland, Ohio, Great Lakes has an amazing standard portfolio of which Elliot Ness is part one of them. Based not on myth but fact, historically speaking the Eliot Ness is named after Mr. Eliot Ness himself, a notorious agent and advocate of prohibition in the 1920s. Ok, a bit removed from being front page news in the latest Enquirer, but far more invigorating and fascinating, and if nothing else, definitely controversial for this beer geek.


He burbles and boils over in my glass as a copper-tinged head churns above deep amber depths with brilliant copper highlights reflecting in my eyes. While his head holds fast, his nose captures my rapt attention with toast glazed in sweet, crunchy caramelized sugars. A bouquet of floral esters and fields of grass carry under it a soft whisper of lemon, melon, and orange. Sweet, toasty, and rich with nutmeg and cinnamon sticks adding the final touch. Amber lagers and amber ales are rather incongruous unto themselves, but there is usually a reasonable level of uniformity and expectancy. So far, the Eliot Ness from Great Lakes has performed admirably. I throw all inhibitions to the wind and dive headfirst into the deep-end. Effervescent and vibrant, the top of my tongue tingles with fresh lemons and key limes while a sweet, meaty undercurrent of oranges and cantaloupe lingers with a tropical kiss. Each quaff leaves trails of lace sticking to the sides of my glass, much like his honey sweetness sticks to my lips. His malty finish is subtle and lightly crunchy with soft grains, toast, and caramelized sugars. Rinse and repeat; each quaff is admirably refreshing and soothing at the same time. A growing presence of dryness on top of my tongue hints of bitter lemon skins. There is something to be said about a good session beer, but Ill have to get back to you on that because my glass is empty.


UFOs are still Unidentified Flying Objects, Bigfoot apparently has big feet, and Eliot Ness is anything but mythical. I imagine that no matter what fate may have conspired during those tumultuous days, a pint of amber in hand would have made it all OK.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

I poured this bottle into my Pilsener glass and it produced a finger worth of white head that turned to a thick lace. The body of the brew was amber to brown.

The look: Clear amber body with a short-lived beige head
In long: Candy-like crisp toffee sweetness.  Quite a bit of dried fruits of all kinds, like taking mouthful of one of those grocery store mix-bag dried fruits.  I personally found the floral hopping insufficient.  This is a good beer and undoubtedly one of the best American dark lager Ive had.  But I pub-crawled the land of dark lagers (Czech Republic) and this Eliot Ness doesnt measure up to the good Czech Viennas, it barely measures up to the average Czech Viennas.

Like fresh baked wheat bread, buttered warmly and lightly spiced, and taken with a side of unsweetened cranberries.  Medium body is generous and expansive in the mouth.

Or does it? This beer just wasnt very good, which is strange because I absolutely love Great Lakes. An aroma of iced tea, lightly sweet with a bit of a twang to it. Appearance is stunning. A beautiful reddish/orange hue, mostly clear with a nice 1 inch head on pour which disipated to a thin scummy foam. The thing about the flavor was the tartness/sour factor which wasnt pleasing at all, especially in a lager. I would almost dismiss it as hop bitterness, but it reminds me of some kind of bug spray. I will definitely have to hunt down a fresher bottle and will re-rate if/when I do. But until that time, this beer was a letdown.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

Eliot Ness poured a very nice, very clear amber. Some red highlights when held to the light. The head was white and creamy with a few larger bubbles mixed in. Only about quarter inch head which disappeared rather quickly to just a light sprinkling on top throughout the drink. Minimal lacing. This beer looked real good except for the head dissapating so quickly.

The smell is just average. Smells of grain and maybe a little husk? Its strange but for some reason theres something in there that brings to mind a wet dog. I also pick up a tiny touch of sweet malt and when it warms a little alcohol.

The taste is very good. A slight sourness on the tongue at first followed by quickly maltiness and a touch of bitterness to finish things off. As it warms it brings out a tiny bit of alcohol.

Nice mouthfeel that had a nice balance of carbonation.
overall an enjoyable and drinkable beer that i would be delighted to have again.","dayton, Ohio, USA","dumacub"

""Enjoy by 30-Nov-05"" but its been in my fridge for the 3 months Ive had the beer, so I should be fine.  With the first sip, its caramely and mildly sweet, more flavorful than most other amber lagers, but not just being sweet and caramely.  Better balance, too, provided by a mild bitterness.  While the beer isnt nearly as earthy and mushroomy like the last time I tried this beer, I have to admit, after several sips, mild earthy flavors start to build on the palate.  Medium bodied from the start right through to the finish, so no thinning with this beer.  Medium amber color, good clarity, a fingers width worth of off-white head on the pour settles to a ring after several minutes.  A very solid amber lager, possibly one of the best Ive tried.01-Oct-05 (12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with bkelley68, thanks Brian!) Uh oh, I kind of lost track of this beer, and now its seen significant time in the bottle, so I guess well see how well this has aged over the past year.  Well, it has a fairly pungent and earthy aroma.  And the flavor is earthy, malty, sweet and mushroomy.  Medium bodied.  Deep amber in color.  The light tan head pours to an average size and settles to a small ring, leaving only a few spots of lace.  So its aged fine by my tastes, but its clearly not the same beer, so I should rerate this at some point.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Head is initially large and beige, receding eventually to a light covering, but providing for a fair amount of lace.  Aroma is packed with intense bready and nutty malts.  Yeasty, doughy, grainy and quite strong.  Light soily hops and touches of caramel and toffee, but lots of breadiness.  The flavor is quite similar, having a good amount of breadiness (brown bread) and plenty of nuts and caramel.  Light notes of vanilla and a moderate yeastiness on end.  The flavor is quite strong and really builds on the your palate.  Low acidity, which is somewhat surprising, as these highly bready notes can often times impart that.  Texture is lightly creamy/watery, with lively, but unobtrusive carbonation.  I almost think I note some alcohol in the finish, after it has warmed significantly, but perhaps not (was sort of a peaty, dry, whiskey note).  Could stand some crisper hops, or more of a lager yeast bite, to clear the palate and the texture can be a bit too aerated/bubbly at times.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1737,"2005-11-22",3.4,"Pours with a  brilliantly clear amber color that shows a rich brownish tinged ruby color when held up to the light.  It is topped by frothy, almost creamy, light tan colored head.  Wow the aroma is quite rich with a malty sweetness that I was not expecting from a Vienna.  The aroma is so sweet it almost takes on a fruity note that is a bit like raisins, or even perhaps a hint of cherry.  There is also a light spicy hop note here that accentuates the fruit character found in the nose.  Underneath the sweetness is a bit of dry toasted malt aromatics that are just noticeable.

The taste is definitely sweet, though thankfully not nearly as much as the aroma might expect.  There are fruity notes of raisins and again a hint of cherry.  The hops have a nice, though subtle, contribution here that is lightly spicy, every so slightly herbal and a nice balancing bitterness in the finish.  As the beer warms up the sweetness picks up a bit, at times it becomes a bit too much.  Most of the time it is held in check by the hopping levels and the under-current of dry maltiness; like notes of biscuits and lightly toasted malt.  This beer certainly blows most examples of the style out of the water, but I cant help but think that this would be that much better if it had not finished a little bit drier; it would be a bit more in balance and all that much more quaffable.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Sweet malt and lightly fruitish hops on the nose.   Flavor is very well balanced.  Malt and hops (citrus and spice) compete for some dominance but none really gets a big leg up.  Malt is ultimately what you have to discuss here.  Sweet caramel and general maltyness (toasty is an after thought).  Really very nice and quaffable.

Nice aroma from this one (others tasted like they werent stored well for some reason), smells like a lager, but a tad more rich, with a bit more fruity hops.  Taste follows the aroma with a bit more emphasis on a deeper version of the typical lager malt flavour.  A beer does lots of things well but is not in any way exceptional, nice and casual, great with grilled food (such as  german sausages).","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","sandwichpants"

1737,"2004-07-07",3.8,"(Best by Sep/20/04) I really like the color of this beer, sort of chestnut red. The nose is full of Hallertau and light sweet malts. The head only lasted for a little while, but there still is a small ring holding onto the rim of the glass. Malt and spicy hops meld effortlessly to produce a tasty brew. I taste bitter chocolate and smooth coffee and cream. This beer is nice and malty, but it is not overly sweet. Actually, the beer finishes dry and hoppy. A good interpretation of the style.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","HighGravity"

1737,"2004-06-19",3.7,"Bottled.  Pour produced an average sized beige head that fell to a thin layer after a few minutes; fair lacing.  Clear med-dark amber color.  Aroma was a harmoniously layered complex of toasty caramel malt, floral hop nose, and some esteriness.  It was marred somewhat by a subtle but discordant sulfury off-note.  Flavor was a nice balance of bitter/sweet up front with some esteriness that emerged mid-palate.  It finished with the same balanced bitter/sweet character accompanied by a pleasant yeastiness.  A gentle but present hop character was evident throughout. Palate was creamy and medium to full bodied with a lively carbonation.  A nice amber (Vienna) lager that was enjoyably crisp and refreshing and easy drinking.  It had a definite American craftbrew character i liked  that was manifest in its subtle but present hop flavor and aroma.

Nose is a slightly musky with a big malt sweet backing and the start mildly sweet with a pleasing malt presence, the top moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is pesky in its acidity, the hops bountiful and pleasing in their spiciness, droughty aftertaste that lingers long on the palate, a great beer from a great brewery.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
1737,"2004-02-27",4.5,"Solid rust/coppery color with a slight chill haze, medium, softly topped chicken meat colored head that sits a good while before settling to a favorable skim and thin, speckled curtains of lace sticking as we go. Aroma is quite light on the nose with some light toasty grains and bread with just a bit of sweetened fruitiness. As it warms a nice smokey-like dryness, roasty hazel nuts, and hard caramel appear in the nose making it much nicer and even a bit stronger. Taste is mild but eager with a small easy start that remains in some mixed maltyness of slight sweetness and light toastyness, but that gains with a gradual presence of uniquely thick seven grain pancake-like toasty roundness. Perfectly milding light grassy spice and hops poke through. Add in the teriffic finish of smokened grains and malts slightly drying and lifting into the finishwith mixed roasty nuttyness. Very intriguing flavors indeed, well put together with a delicately rich and smooth body that keeps convalescing. A true showmanship of the meaning behind hand crafted. Wow, what a recipe, great stuff!  Try it and see, you'll be impressed no doubt! Absolutely drinkable to the fullest! My new Vienna/Marzen to keep around at all costs!

Nice, deep amber color with a tannish head which proves ephemeral. A touch of spotty lacing remains.

Smells like a caramel factory. Sweet burned sugar aromas and hints of molasses and toasted raisin bread.

Big malt up front, riding on just enough hops to carry it through. Well carbonated, this beer has a medium to full mouthfeel and a sweet finish. Faint hints of caramel and chocolate abound. Final kick of mild hops really makes this drinkable.","New York, USA","DCopperfields"

The nose is of toffee, caramel, buttermilk, grapefruit and white wine or a very dry port or sherry.

As I believe to be true with Vienna-style lagers, this beer is predominantly malt aroma and flavor, with enough hops to clean up the finish.

1737,"2003-03-01",3.3,"Interesting beer.  Has a sweet malty taste, with a little hops balance.  Overall gives a thin, sweet impression.  Not one of my favorites, but a smooth drink nonetheless.  So far my favorite Great Lakes varieties are the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter and the Dortmunder Gold.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
1737,"2003-02-26",3.4,"This has a subtle malt aroma dominated by German hops.  Glowing copper with a thin nougat colored head.  The mouthfeel is fizzy and lacks complexity and balance.

1737,"2003-02-25",3.4,"Deep amber with a malty, caramel aroma with a definite sweetness.  Hops present at end; very dry.  Slightly stale sample, doesn't measure up to the other beers I've had from Great Lakes.  Lots of carbonation.","Washington DC, USA","jskendzel"
1737,"2003-02-10",3.4,"Pours a perfect amber color in my book. Thick beige head. Nice lacing.
Deep malty aromas, almost like there's some biscuit malt in there. Roasted malt is evident in the aroma too.
The noble hops (Saaz?) really shows through in the flavor. The caramelized malts sweetness balances out the nitter hop bite nicely.
Has a very smooth drinkablity. The touch of a lager. Nice.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bender"

Slight caramel that blends perfectly with the malt to give the impression you have just eaten a piece of bread right out of the oven.  Along with Lakefronts Riverwest the best Vienna you can get in America.","Ohio, USA","redlem"

Sadly, these brews are near impossible to find west of the Rockies.

Amazing that this beer comes from  Cleveland .   I first had it there .  I am delighted to see that my neighborhood deli. sells it by the sixer .
Its got a mature angle about it.
the nuttyness is nice, especially with certain foods .
It has a certain swarthyness that keeps me coming back for more.
Its great with hearty foods as well .

Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, cookie, toasted light bread), lightly to moderately hoppy (flowers, apricot), with notes of peach and honey. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.  Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation.

1737,"2002-03-10",4.0,"I had a bottle of this tonight after work.  This brew pours a hazy medium orangish red
hue.  The brew is not pasteurized and has tiny particles of thin density.  The mostly lasting
head is huge, off white and creamy and has excellent lacing.  The aroma is well balanced: a
bit spicy with moderate hints of roasted grains and nuts, also having a moderate resinous
piney hoppy texture, and light yeasty tones.  To be quite honest, I was better able to analyze
more of the hoppy qualities from my burps than from the nose.  The beers initial flavor is
moderately sweet and slightly bitter, transcending to a finish that is lightly sweet with a
moderate sharp roasted bitterness that is slightly nutty.  I enjoyed the medium body and
dry texture.  The carbonation was a bit lively for my liking, and the finish has a moderate
amount of clean astringency.  Overall a very decent brew.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"
