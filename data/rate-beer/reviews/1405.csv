1405,"2013-02-16",4.0,"On draft at the Livermore Saloon. It pours a dark brownish red color with a khaki head. The aroma is a good balance of toasted malt with some cherry and dry notes of wood. The flavor has toasty malt with just a hint of roasted malt, cherry, earth and spicy wood in the finish. Very well balanced and warming. It was a delight.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

Palate is thick, sticky and chewy. Seems like it is probably a great beer for what it is but it isnt what im looking for. Too Sweet. Really really sweet.","California, USA","dukeredhair"
1405,"2012-09-16",4.5,"thanks to Tim for the hookup on this, and in the new 4th Ann glass to boot.  You rock!  Pours dark brown with a huge light tan head that leaves a nice lacing the length of the glass.  Aroma is really nice and have tremendous depth.  Big toast and nutty malts, the rye whiskey is apparent but finessed well as it only complements.  Flavor is extremely rich, caramel and light roast notes blend with nutty character and big wood in the finish.  This is awesome stuff, and one of my favorites from this brewery.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","fata2683"
