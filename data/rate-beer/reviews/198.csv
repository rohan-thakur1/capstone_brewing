198,"2015-11-10",4.0,"Plum-like, toffee malt aroma with some earthiness and a tiny bit of floral hop aroma. Subdued due to low carb and cold temp. Wish the aroma was stronger as it is very nice.

Pours murky black-brown with tiny fizz and almost no head that fades quick after swirling.

Flavor is restrained chocolate over light wood/earth, light sweetness followed by a touch of roast and a little bit more hop bitterness. All elements that taste fresh and not overpowering as this beer finishes very dry and is light bodied and a little slick on the tongue. No chalkiness or astringency typical of a porter is found here, which is pretty nice. Also no unpleasant roast tartness.

Overall, a great subtle porter. Not a domineering flavorful beer, but one that is VERY well balanced and extremely pleasant to drink with enough interesting malt character to keep from being boring. Very well done as it invites sip after sip.","","jmanock"

Bien quil ne faut pas se fier à lallure dune bouteille, jaime lorsque celle-ci représente bien le produit quelle contient. À linstar de son contenant, le contenu affiche un caractère noble et élaboré avec soin. Tout se joue en finesse: tant les arômes que la texture, cest satiné, souple, léger, chaud. Dès le nez au bord du verre, jy retrouve des notes complexes de mélasse, de caramel, de chocolat, de vanille mais le tout très délicatement amalgamé. Tiens, je crois que les trois mots qui traduisent le mieux ma pensée en ce moment précis sont: complexité, équilibre et cohérence. Tout se tient dans cette bière: les malts sont juste assez torréfiés sans trop être sucrés; saveurs qui sunissent parfaitement à la légère fraîcheur provenant de quelques jeunes houblons verts. La densité est relativement faible malgré une rondeur agréable et lalcool, et bien celui-ci est complètement dissimulé.

This aromatic English-style Porter brings together blackberry jam, chocolate and molasses flavors, as roastiness and hop earthiness make the palate pause before a sensuous return of the initial malt-driven forces in the aftertaste.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the darkest brown.
-The malty return (malt flavors and residual sugars) is as sublime as the aroma.
-That fruity fermentation character is wonderful with the chosen grain bill.
-All this in a bottle thats been all the way across the globe! This must be absolutely to die for, fresh, on cask, near the source... Dark Star level quality, Im sure.
-Mouthfeel is smooth and enhances drinkability despite the richness of flavors.

198,"2014-04-01",4.3,"100th Porter Rating, I didnt have a great bookend for this milestone & finding one was pretty well not worth the effort, so I opted for a Porter that I had on hand & had been wanting to try for a good long while now. 
Pours basically black with an absolutely gigantic fluffy khaki head that leaves good lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is really very rich, plenty of chocolate, pipe tobacco, & dark fruit all around. Its pungent & has some lightly hoppy, but is really just a big rich elegantly bouquet beer. 

The flavor follows the aroma in a similar, elegant, & well nuanced fashion. Its really nicely bitter, mostly in a roasty/coffe like way but thats not without a noticeable sharp & lightly fruity hop character and subsequent bitterness. The beer has some rich molasses & cavendish tobacco notes, its got a great dark chocolate character as well. The sweetness level is moderately low but the way sweetness is used for balance in this beer is excellent. As it warms more espresso & dark fruit emerge. This hits all the right porter notes for me then does a little overtime... goodness.

The mouthfeel is velvety at first but there is a lingering sharpness. Feels as hie on the tongue as any mouth coating Imperial Stout ever could. 
Fantastic beer that exceeded all my expectations, Im happy to mark it as my 100th Porter rating.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

Impressive, lingering flavors of dark chocolate and mocha captivate the senses. Creamy mouthfeel, with full carbonation. Medium-medium-plus body.

198,"2013-06-09",4.0,"A diminutive off-white cap reigns above the close to blackness. Whew, thats an aromatic one with plenty of intricacies. Its dominant feature is probably that of a quality dark chocolate, albeit perhaps a bit fudgey and dense in nature, with plenty of substance, evolving as it warms up toward anise and raisin subterfuges. Bold, chewy and earthy, it showcases abundant esters and bready yeast character, marking one think of blueberry and chocolate muffins. Thick texture with tiny yet abundant bubbles managing to cleanse the palate up and remove the mollasses-like sweetness impression with the help of an above average acidity level from the roast and efficient leafy hops in the background. Impressive ale, certainly far more intense than anything Ive had in the UK, but focused, well-extracted flavours with intensity and texture yet neglectable alcohol presence.

Aroma is quite nice, chocolate, chocolate milk, mild coffee, toffee, hint of maple and/or vanilla. Flavour features a lot of these same sweet elements but theres a nice dryness to the finish that adds balance, which may or may not be from earthy/herbal hop characters.

App.:  Deep brown-black with a fair mocha head.

Palate:  Medium+ body, disorganized effervescence.
  
Flav.:  A little more black coffee, about the same dark chocolate, slightly less of that odd note, cooked green peppers, pretty big but not entirely to my liking; dry with pretty good bitterness and a long, mouth-coating finish of dark-roasted malts.

S-- Fresh Licorice is the dominant smell, followed by coffee and dark sweet berry chocolate.Very big smell and quite earthy and a bit of a pungent smell.

T-- Still get a bit of the licorice but strong roasted coffee is very prevalent, more like overdrawn cold espresso. Quite bitter and still earthy. Very rich dark chocolate is also there, as well as blackberries and raspberries 

M-- Coffee taste sticks around for a while but the rest of the flavor is a little flat and disappears very quickly, a little bit thin. Needs more hops. The coffee and chocolate flavor hides it well and in some ways overdo the hop presence. Could use a bit less carbonation.

198,"2012-04-19",3.8,"In short: A nice tasty roasted porter with grassy peppery hops.  Very good.
How: Bottle 500ml.  consumed relatively fresh a few weeks after purchase (after a boat ride from New-Zealand).  Bottle sent to me by blankboy, thanks a lot Paul 
The look: Black body topped by a medium tan-beige head
In long: Nose is roasted, light notes of coffee and has a strong showing of peppery hops. Taste has some burnt caramel, chocolaty malts, some raisins, light notes of espresso.  Carbonation is a bit aggressive.  By itself the grassy peppery hops didnt seem so dominant, but when sipping back and forth between this beer and my girlfriends Fullers London Porter (her fetish porter) then the peppery character of the Renaissance Elemental Porter seemed totally disproportionate.  Rather dry (again compared to the Fullers London Porter) and quite tasty for the style. Lacks the smoothness and class of a classic like Fullers London Porter but makes up for it with more Omph!.

The flavor leads me to believe that theres a touch of infection setting in here.  The flavor is slightly sour and theres way more carbonation than there should be for the style.  The body is a little thin also.  The hoppiness that is in here doesnt really work all that well for the style for me either.  Depressing, as this is the second fancy New Zealand Porter I bought for what I thought was an excessively high price that turned out to be off.

The flavour has a nice start with roast malt and bitter chocolate but these harsher burnt bitter tastes develop too much giving a harsh finish of burnt caramel / black treacle.

Average creamy beige head that mostly lasted. Good display of lacework. Black color. Aroma of berries, toasted malt, dried fruit, mild port wine like. Over the palate came dry roasted malty feel. Chocolate and hint of coffee and wood. Underlying hops. Medium bodied with a soft carbonation and dry and light alcoholic texture. Moderated bitter and sweet flavor. Roasted malty and chocolate like finish.

198,"2008-02-29",4.9,"This is my favourite beer style ,what a great 4 pack from this brewery. The bottle poured an inky black with a fluffy tan head, very tight bubbles. The scent of this beer was coffeeish and chocolaty with hints of ripe plums. The creamy rich head was followed by an intense flavour dominated by roasted notes and sweet caramel, finishing with a lovely chocolate sensation. The lingering flavour was still around well after the bottle was gone. This beer is truely a stand out in their range and accordingly this is the brewers favourite style.","Tauranga, NEW ZEALAND","Cconners"
198,"2008-02-24",3.9,"Pours a sparkling black with diminishing beige head and a hint of lacings. Smells of toasted malts and oak. Low sweetness with some lingering bitterness. Aromas of toasted malts, dark chocolate and oak. Nice, quite heavy hops profile with slightly piney. Tastes a lik redwine. Soft carbonation. Medium bodied with a slightly sticky mouthfeel. Long dry finish with aromas of hops, and hints of sweet liquirish. This stout can easily messure up with the best American stouts.","Copenhagen OE, DENMARK","sunevdj"
198,"2008-02-16",4.1,"Bottle, a lively pour, black with a purple-tinge and a huge pillowy tan head. Beautiful aroma, very fruity (like raisins) and quite hoppy for a porter. A good full mouth of chocolate, some aniseed, and a high hop presense again. The finish brings more roasted malt to the palate and stay with you for a while. Delicious!","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","TheGrandMaster"
198,"2008-02-08",4.1,"Fairly hoppy and tons of body - quite thick and notes of chocolate and burnt tree.  Very solid from a terrific brewer out of Blenheim.  A must-try.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
198,"2007-08-17",4.0,"Bottle. A great porter, very true to style, and a refreshing change from many NZ takes on Porter, which often have a very thin burnt character. None of that here. Big aroma, roasty/toasty notes, and a hint of plums maybe. A full rich smooth flavour, with very well integrated malt and hops. Caramel and coffee dominate, and lead into a dry finish with a roasted flavour that really sticks around.","Hamilton, NEW ZEALAND","greig"
198,"2007-05-26",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 28, 2008 Fantastic beer, loads of flavour without the sharp taste.  Thoroughly enjoy this beer on a winters day in front of the TV on the couch!!!  Love it!!","Bakewell, Derbyshire, ENGLAND","kempicus"
198,"2007-05-10",4.1,"A joy to taste. Deep black colour, rich plum like scents with hints of stonefruit. The taste lingers long after the bottle is empty. Worth indulging with a Cuban cigar (apologies American raters).","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
198,"2007-03-21",3.6,"Dark black in colour with thick creamy toffee coloured head. Tropical fruit and hints of fejoia. Roasted coffee and malts, mild hop bitterness, dry finish.

198,"2006-02-09",4.0,"Draught at the brewpub.  Near black. Dry and surprisingly crisp, medium bodied. Heavily roasty, anise and licorice dominates. Well hopped, resulting in a mangoish bitter finish. Like the other beers at this new brewpub its well crafted.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
