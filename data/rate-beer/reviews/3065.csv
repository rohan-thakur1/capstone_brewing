3065,"2015-08-27",4.0,"1 liter growler gifted to me by my buddy nick. Drank it on the edge of a large cliff near Lake of the Clouds, Mi. Brown/amber pour, large tannish head. Nice aroma with a bit of dank hops, dakr fruits, leather, bourbon, and oak. Flavor is caramel, bitter hops, bourbon and oak, nice mouthfeel fully carbed, believe it was counterpressure filled and its held up for the few months its been in the swingtop.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
3065,"2015-01-08",3.7,"On tap at some point at bells. Took this rating from my notes.. And as I remember it tastes just like regular third coast used to taste. Somewhat disappointing when you wait what seems like forever hoping itll come out again only to just drink a pretty decent normal third coast. Whatever... Its a barley wine the way they should taste so its all good.",", Michigan, USA","coyotehunter"

3065,"2013-08-20",3.9,"Draft pour at GTMW 2013. Pours a hazy, murky brown with a small beige head. Lots of bourbon barrel in this one; vanilla, oak, caramel, raisins, dates, candied pecans, and coconut. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a dry, malty mouthfeel. Really nice barrel treatment, and Im not a Third Coast guy.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

The beer is listed on the beer list as Third Coast Reserve, was on regular draft (not cask), and is listed at 10.9% abv. Looks good; a cloudy amber-tinted brown with thin off-white lacing.

3065,"2008-08-18",4.3,"Bottle from Santa.  Thanks!Pours a decent tea brown with an aroma of alcohol soaked raisin with a slight touch of peanut butter chocolate.  Flavor is a nice blend of raisin, plumb, cherry chocolate, and a touch of white wine.  Thick and full mouthfeel.

3065,"2008-05-17",4.2,"Tap @ The Oak Cafe 3-1-08. Cloudy/muddy brown, film for head. Nice sweet bourbon aroma up front, vanilla, butter, caramel, and surprisingly some hop citrus in the background. Flavor is dominated by buttery/vanilla bourbon, caramel/toffee is very mellow. Big, thivk luscious mouthfeel. As it warms becomes way too easy a drink.","Lincoln Park, Michigan, USA","Styles"
3065,"2008-03-24",4.1,"On tap @ Bells tasting. Hazy dirty orange pour with a yellowed off white head.

Flavors of butterscotch, bready caramel malt, vanilla, booze...again a lot of big, heavy flavors. Thick body, buttery/boozey with a boozey/sweet finish.

Amazingly there was quite a bit of sediment that settled out of the handbottle (from tap!)... never seen that.  Has a huge, rich, oak and bourbon filled nose, with sharp plum, leafy tobacco, some richly sweet dark fruits, mashed plums and red wine... really complex, unique, inviting, decadent and amazing aroma.  Sweet flavor of maple, bacon, banana, bourbon, charred, woody plums, some resinous black cherry, more resinous oak, brown sugar, etc, you get the picture.  Damn good.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3065,"2008-03-17",4.1,"At The Oaks.  Pours a ruby brown in color with a short lived head.  Smell is bourbon soaked dark fruit and malt.  Taste is very balanced and complex.  This could be sipped all day, Im really enjoying this.  I dont know if the barrel aging brings out flavors in Larrys beers that arent in the original beer, but they become more complex.  Dont get me wrong the beers are already amazing, but the barrel aging takes these to an unholy level.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AllAboutStout"
3065,"2008-03-16",3.9,"Growler shared by goldtwins.  Deep amber-brown beer with a thin head.  Aroma is very sweet and fruity.  Lots of rich bourbony oaky sweetness.  Bright sweet vanilla character, a bit of brown sugar, oak and sweet toffee.  Spicy and lightly herbal.  The flavour is a little bit boozy but there is a soft toffeeish character.  As it warms, the booziness fades and the beer really comes together.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
3065,"2008-03-15",4.3,"Growler shared, thanks to goldtwins.  Brown pour, a little muddy.  Aroma is oaky vanilla, rich malt, and a little alcohol / bourbon.  The mouthfeel is very smooth and soft for the intensity of this beer.  Flavor is sweet malt, candy sugar, chocolate, vanilla, and some of the bourbon in the finish.  A lot of different flavors, and I enjoyed it immensely.","San Mateo, California, USA","golubj"
3065,"2008-03-15",3.6,"Thanks to goldtwins for sharing this - growler - really hazy dark red beer - very spicy, oak and vanilla aroma, heavy on the bourbon, but not overpowering, with some cinnamon way in the back - the flavor is a bit too sweet, and very bourbon-heavy up front - some vanilla and toasted coconut - strong alcohol and spiciness on the back end, and the wood starts to come through, along with some brown sugar and chocolate - a bit boozy and sweet, but as it warms it gets a little more vinous, balancing out the sweetness and giving it a little more character - I think I prefer the regular third coast.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

Lots of sweet, toasty bourbon and warm coconut and buttery notes in the aroma; vanilla-tinged, tasty, syrupy barrel notes; just a bit more reserved than Id like.  Medium-to-full, chewy mouthfeel: relaxed carbonation; tasty, dense bourbon character with soft edges: tons of brown sugar, vanilla, and melted butter; generous, excellent bourbon over a warming caramel and dried fruit core; tasty, tasty stuff with an excellent barrel presence.

The nose is just chuck full of bourbon.  This is one hot beer.  The Third Coast Old Ale is one of my favorite beers, but I dont think that the barrel helped it at all.  Flavor is just dominated by bourbon, with caramel sweetness and some bready malts.  This beer just tingles on the tongue.  The barrel just bludgeons this beer.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
3065,"2008-03-08",4.1,"On tap.  Pours a dark red/mahogany color with a small, scattered white head.  Aroma is intense.  Heavy notes of bourbon, wood, oak, vanilla.  Really strong but I enjoyed them.  There is some caramel maltiness underneath from the beer but the oak notes really are in the foreground.  Taste is the same.  Loads of vanilla and oak, bourbon, with a bittersweet finish.  Full bodied and sticky. Reminded me a lot of Founders Backwoods Bastard.

Flavor had lots of caramel/toffee, vanilla, a bit of sherry and chocolate, and some mild alcohol.  The bourbon is still ever-present.  Full body with light carbonation.  Very good.

3065,"2008-01-09",4.4,"Tap at Capital Ale House - Innsbrook.  Damn... I love this beer in its normal state and when you put the Bourbon ageing on it I was in heaven.  Great smooth aroma with some light fruits, cherry is noticeable.  Loved the taste, some of the harshness of the normal version has gone out and been mellowed.  Loved the light vanilla accents in the ending.  Amazing stuff.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Numenor"
3065,"2008-01-05",3.7,"On tap at Bar Louie - Ann Arbor, MI. Heavy bourbon nose over pineapple, hops, cream and the typical TCOA estery aroma. Very nice, if a twinge hot. Even glowing at a cold temp. Pours a muddied rufous and brown, with a thin rim of tan. Right away, on the front end the flavor is too bourbon hot. Coarse. Bitter. Straight fresh bourbon, right  in a glass dominates the front end of the beer. Then theres a discordant clash with the hops, having aged lightly into some vegetal notes. Following through is the good estery run and warm, rich creaminess this beer plays. So, its not working real well right now, but I bet if you aged this 3-5 years, it would be completely out of sight. Im surprised by how well the carbonation is working. Finishes on a light toast note.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3065,"2007-12-30",3.9,"Draft at the Capital Ale House Innsbrook Kerstbier Fest.  Sampled after a firkin pour of Expedition and Expedition through the ""Caffeinator.""  Delighted to try this.  Murky brown, slight head.  Bourbon, oak, and slight cherry nose, rich caramel malt in the background.  Flavor has massive rich caramel malts, loads of bourbon barrel tannins, and vanilla in the back.  Nice.  You could make an argument that there is too much bourbon influence here, but I enjoyed it.  Although I probably prefer the normal version of the Old Ale.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
3065,"2007-11-19",4.0,"On tap at Graydons Crossing, Grand Rapids. Murky orange-brown body, thin, tight cream head. Heavy oak dominates the aroma, which warms to sweet breads, musty caramels, and alcohol. Big oak body, the oak tending to dominate the flavor profile. Sweet, musty caramels kick in over time, in addition to oxidized hops. Dusty. A thin red wine or brandy character also becomes apparent after the palate is coated. And, a touch of plum pudding and bubblegum. But, the predominant characteristic is oak beginning to finish. Just a touch of prickly alcohol reminds the drinker of its potency. Very good.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
3065,"2007-11-18",4.5,"On tap at Maduro prior to the 2007 GTMW: Pours a barely transparent dark mahogany with a thin, frothy coating of light tan head.  Sweet caramely malty bourbon oaky vanilla nose smells like a dessert.  Rich complex body starts with full sweet caramely malt and a nice balance of oaky bourbon and smooth bittersweetness with lots of molasses and a hint of warmth toward the finish.

3065,"2007-08-13",3.7,"On tap at Maduro. Enjoyed this side by side with BA 7000 -- not bad double-fisting. This was surprisingly sweet -- bitter hops were muted in favor of cane syrup, brown sugar, and stone fruit flavors.  The bourbon again dominated (similar to 7K) with strong vanilla and hazelnuts components to the beer. Finish was boozy. Solid, but there are better barrel aged interpretations of the style out there. Nonetheless, an experiment worthy of Bells.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
3065,"2007-08-13",3.6,"On tap at Maduro for the GTMW pre party
Dark red to brownish colore with no head.  Basic bourbon, oak, vanilla aromas of virtually every bourbon barrel aged beer.  The flavor still has some malt character, but is mostly over run by booze.  I went back and checked my regular Third Coast rating.  I didnt get any of the character I did then.  Bummer.  I love the regular stuff.  This was just too hot for me.  I think I still gave it a good number.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
3065,"2007-08-13",4.8,"On tap at Maduro  GTMW pre-party.  Rating #1800!  This was my winner from a hotly-contested weekend of drinking bliss!  Poured a deep, murky, and seductive brown with a short but well-retained cap of milky-beige head.  The aroma picked up dry, smoky, and nutty notes for an intriguing first impression.. the barrel-aging slowly creeps in with toasted oak and vanilla beans.. soft and enticing.. hints of cherry, toffee, and aged caramel show up after that.   This just blew me away in the flavor department!!  light vanilla, bourbon, and dry brandy sugars flow seamlessly over the buttered toffee, aged caramel, and nutty notes at the core of this beast.. picked up more of the barrel as it warmed, but remained perfectly-integrated.. just Brilliant!  Heavy-bodied on the palate and toasty with expert precision on the great build of power from the first impression through the finish.  All I can ask of Larry now is that he bottle some!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

This was very stong and I had two samples and the whiskey was so strong I had to just try to taste everything that was in there.  Still a nice BB barleywine.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","KingpinIPA"
3065,"2007-08-12",3.8,"On tap at Maduros
This free sample was the second best beer of the night.  If I wasnt attempting to save myself for Saturdays festival I would have gotten a pint but the pours that night were ridiculous ($4 for sixteen ounces of amazing beer?  If you cant make the Great Taste then come for the Friday night events).  It took a while to work my way through it by which time I wa beginning to wish I had more.
Aroma / Appearance - Caramel, oak and vanilla play the old ale aspect of the beer against the bourbon barrel.  It is very mellow and as Blake said would go perfectly with a cigar.  The body was the color of dark stained wood with no head.
Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel is thick and suffocating.  Oak forms a base against which the vinous and bourbony flavors can unfold.  Creamy caramel and yeast are evident.  I found it a bit strong but still extremely solid in most aspects.  While it is not quite on par with some of the regular Old Ales it is no slouch.  If you happen across this at a festival or tap room do not hesitate to order a pint.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
3065,"2007-08-12",4.2,"Tap at Maduro pre-GTMW party.  This would be a GREAT cigar beer.  The beer pours to a murky dark mahogany brown body with no head.  The aroma is perfume hops with bourbon and brandy barrels blended with toffee.  The beer has a nice pine hop flavor to compliment the cookie malt and toffee that is balanced by a strong bourbon and brandy barrel aging.  The beer is really sweet and has a creamy full body and moderate alcohol.  I wanted a cigar with it but alas, didnt want to blow my palate out for the GTMW.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
