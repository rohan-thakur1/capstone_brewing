4381,"2016-12-03",3.8,"Dark beer with a lasting foamy beige head. Almost smoky roasted grain nose. Rich chocolate flavors with brown sugar sweetness, some burnt sugar, and the roasted grains. Smooth mouth feel. The ABV sneaks up on you.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
4381,"2016-07-07",4.1,"A good thick malty beer. Dark brown and opaque with a full tan head. Chocolate notes with a hint a hoppy bitterness and lots of malty sweetness.","Amesbury, Massachusetts, USA","MrMeadMan"
4381,"2016-07-07",4.3,"DATE: July 7, 2016... OCCASION: A Game of Thrones Thursday, still catching up on Season Five... GLASSWARE: Sam Adams lager... an oil-black body upholds its namesake, while the brownish head sits as two thick fingers that forms its creaminess and resilience... chocolate, creamy coffee, peat and caramel meld for an alluring invitation, a stoutish one, at that... toasted, warming mouthfeel rich with creaminess and strength... for a beer at 7%, quite agreeable, with its body cloaked in smooth sippability... sweet, lactic milkiness that holds enough malt to maintain its lager status... a fantastic flavor profile, brimming with peat, fire and cereal malts--oats and earth... a surprisingly authentic schwarzbier whose strength is palpable... a winner in this mix of six...","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"
4381,"2016-05-30",3.8,"From the Adventures in Lager pack. Dark brown to black pour with a decent sized, foamy and rocky cappuccino head that settles to a thick film and leaves some splotchy stuff for lacing. Nose involves roasted coffee and cream, some chocolate, some minty and leafy hops, almost like a maple sugar note, some marshmallow. Pretty sweet, fairly bitter. Medium to full bodied toward thick, softer, creamy, finishing roasty, a touch fruity (raisin, prune), and minty with some bitterness lingering. This is pretty tasty. I would probably rather have it around 5.7-6.2% just for drinkability, but it doesnt show alcohol or anything like that. Nice example of a fun style that doesnt get enough love here stateside.","North Central, Indiana, USA","574deadzone"
4381,"2016-05-25",3.1,"12oz bottle on 13th May 2016 in California while on holiday. Poured into a Corsendonk badged tulip. As the name suggests this is a black coloured beer, the head a little brown affair. Coffee and chocolate notes in both the nose and taste, liquorice hints too, all a bit thin strength wise, but findable if you try.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"
4381,"2016-05-16",3.5,"Pours black into a Sam glass. Mocha head with medium retention recedes leaving spot lacing. Chocolate and espresso aromas. Sweet milk chocolate, soy and licorice upfront turning to espresso in the lasting finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"

4381,"2016-03-23",3.5,"Fits the style though I prefer the Germans. Nose is bright with light anise, cocoa, and a bit of dark fruit. Palate starts aggressive, bubbly, heavier dark malt presence than I expected, and finishes rich, not particularly clean. Plenty going on here. Clear reddish brown with thick head and soapy lacing.","Rochester, New York, USA","jb"

4381,"2016-02-12",2.0,"Pours a dark brown with head. A coffee, dark fruit and malt aroma. Taste is not what I expected - very strong prunes, caramel, toasted malts, and liquorish. Has a dry finish from the prunes and malts.","New Jersey, USA","jflopsu"
4381,"2015-03-18",3.5,"Deep dark brown coloured body with a thinnish, half a centimetre tall tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, toffee, caramel, earth and some hints of coffee - nice and deep. Medium-bodied; Strong roasty flavours with hints of rye and grain showing some caramel, brown sugar, earth and a little metallic notes at the end. Aftertaste shows a good sweetness with a little coffee finish and a strong roastiness that doesnt leave any bitterness - just a nice profile thats moderately complex. Overall, a nice rich beer with some pungent sweetness and a solid toasty flavour. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased as a 24-pack from Costco in Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia for US$30,99 for 24 bottles on 17-October-2014 sampled at home in Washington on 17-March-2015 - for Saint Patricks Day 2015!","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
4381,"2014-12-12",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2016 12 oz bottles (2 - different days) with a BB date of Feb. 2015. 
Pours opaque and black with brownish edges. Small head has decent retention.
Excellent aroma is followed by a somewhat disappointing flavor. The flavor is a bit above average but not as stellar as the aroma suggests. Lightly smokey. Nice lingering flavor of medium and dark roasted malts with hints of spicy hops and coffee.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
4381,"2014-12-03",4.1,"Pours deep dark brown with a foamy tan head. aroma of dark sweet syrupy malt and chocolate with a touch of breadiness. the taste is malt forward sweet chocolatey little bit of smokiness and a slight bitterness allowing for a dry finish.

4381,"2014-11-02",3.5,"Lightly tarry, olivine roast aroma. Black, sure enough. Thin bone-colored foam. Delightful balance except it was slightly too acidic. Tanginess clung in the finish. On tap, Brass Tap, Tallahassee Midtown.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"

4381,"2014-09-08",3.6,"First rating. 12oz bottle from the Lager case. Brown-black body, some translucent edges. Foamy beige head. Has that Eastern European bakers brown chocolate sweetness. Not really so much a double as just a biggish Schwarzbier. A little oily, though it has some nice lager tones, it lacks much complexity. Deep fruity tones reminiscent of a Dopplebock at times. Respectable offering.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
