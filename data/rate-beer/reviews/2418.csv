Flavor immediately shows the barrel aging. Vanilla, strawberry and tannins. Super sweet, but somehow balanced. Pretty assertive acidity in the back when youre looking for it, but I didnt even notice at first. Wood, alcohol burn, apple, clove, honey, a touch of black pepper.

2418,"2015-09-06",4.5,"How: Sample (1½ oz) at Northern Kingdom Tasting Center. 

>>> An elegant, wonderfully complex and incredibly tasty ice cider with a flavor profile leaning toward liquorous wine and Sauternes. Wow! 

-  Clear bright orangey-golden color leaving long sticky legs on the glass. 
-  The complexity of this one is just out of this world. Flavors are swirling between sweet decadent apples, bright acidic presence and superb oak features... and yet this is still wonderfully balanced. 
-  The oak-aging is suiting this one like a glove. 
-  I love the liquorous Sauternes-like flavor profile. 
-  Medium body. Liquorous and rather tannic. Finish is impressive with a mouth coating sweetness cut by a sharp acidity, followed by a much welcome alcohol warming and ending with mild lingering oak spiciness. 
-  This is a masterpiece! 

Flavors:  Baked apples, oak, wood spiciness, apple sauce, alcohol, winey notes, toffee, butter (in a good way).","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
