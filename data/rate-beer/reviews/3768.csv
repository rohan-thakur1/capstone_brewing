3768,"2010-06-15",3.7,"Sampled on tap April 2010 @ ChurchKey, Washington DC
A dark, amber-brown color shows a lightly hazy plum color when held up to the light. The head is thin, wispy and has a tan color to it. Softly tart smelling and there is a light clove note as well as aromas of tart plum, floral plum, something that is potpourri like, a hint of orange somehow as well as some toasted, biscuit-like malt character that becomes noticeable after a bit. Somehow this smells a bit soap like (a potpourri flavored soap).

The beer tastes sweet with ample clove flavors and has a nice tart finish. It is quite fruity tasting with lots of plum like notes as well as some caramelized apple flavors. The finish is quite spicy tasting , both from carbonic acid as well as the fermentation character and higher alcohol notes. Hmm, there is a lot of spiciness to this beer really, again I am drawn to that potpourri comparison, but there is also some floral notes, a light herbal component as well as some touches of lavender and pepper. As the beer warms up the malt character becomes more noticeable; flavors of whole grain, toasted though not burnt bread, brown sugar and biscuit notes.

This is an interesting beer, it is quite complex and even a bit confusing for a traditional Weizenbock as there is lots of spiciness in this beer, but in the end it is quite tasty.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3768,"2008-03-24",3.1,"Objectively speaking:
A dark, fully malty, gently spicy toasted ale with little yeast or wheat character.


I like:
Chewy malt character. Large cerealic flavours array- complex maltiness. Pleasant roasty undertones. Fun nutty (hazelnut) touch. No alcohol noticed. Well-extracted toastiness. Quite fruity, but in a very ripe way - not juicy.




I dislike:
Rather oily texture could use more tightness despite the rather active carbonation. Very limited yeast character - more of a very subtly spicy malt bomb. Not refreshing at all, this is quite sweet and did not show much wheatiness.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

The weizen yeast gives off plenty of esters and the dark, roasted malts supply a nice bittersweet mix.  Like bananas dipped in melted chocolate.

Low carbonation and little to no hop presence gave it almost no bitterness at all, I was expecting it to have a more robust roasted taste but its the yeast that is firmly in control here, with green, unripe banana flavors.  Warm alcoholic bite became more present as the Beer warmed up.  I really enjoyed this one!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"

3768,"2007-01-17",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2008 Any first impressions?
-A ring of foam circles near blackness, as a few burgundy highlights show up under the light.
-Inspiring cloves are deeply rooted in a fruit cake comprised of multifarious candied fruit. A memorable perfume.
-Dessert spiciness wondrously melds into the raisins and roasting fruit cake.
-The rich maltiness is well-carbonated, and makes this fine sipper quite supple.

What if you dig deeper?
-Alcohol is very well-hidden.
-Roastiness and banana esters bloom under the aromas candied spiciness.
-That candied sweetness wisely flows into juicy tartness, an impressive rolling flavor landscape.
 -Right on style, this is rich, flavorful, complex, and drinkable; what more could you want from a weizenbock? Or from any beer for that matter?
