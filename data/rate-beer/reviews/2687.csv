2687,"2017-06-20",3.3,"50 cl. can @ Home. 
Aroma: not very intense aromas of toasted malts, caramel, malts, bread crust, biscuits. Only very subtle hops overtones. Hints of alcohol.
Appearance: deep amber to brown color with high head thickness. Very creamy foam. Beige head made of mid to big sized bubbles. Low to medium hazyness. Very high retention. Medium Brussels lacing.
Taste: medium sweetness, medium bitterness, no sourness. Flavors of toasted malts, caramel, bread crust, biscuits. Burnt caramel and roasted malts overtones. Balance is towards the sweetness. No much perceived bitternessat first. Sweet at first and more bitter towards the end. Alcohol level is noticeable in the flavor. 
Palate: medium body, oily to creamy texture, low to medium carbonation, very long bittersweet (more bitter than sweet and increasingly bitter) finish with flavors of toasted malts, caramel, hints of burnt caramel and roasted malts. The bitterness is slightly astringent.
Overall: very good color and appearance. Not very intense but good toasted malts and caramel aromas. Good flavors too. Not much noticeable hops in aroma or flavor. A very good beer. Pretty pleasant and drinkable. Very complex mix of flavors. Intriguing.","Pontevedra, SPAIN","GoddamnNoise"
2687,"2017-06-18",3.8,"Une bière brune, aux reflets rubis, avec une grosse carbonatation et une bonne effervescence. Au nez, caramel, toffee, réglisse noire, et un espèce de côté de grain fumé bizarre que jai jamais senti auparavant dans une bière. En bouche, on remarque tout de suite une absence totale deffervescence, mes yeux me jouent des tours. Cest fort malté! Le gout de toffee est fort present, le côté caramélisé de lalcool également. Il y a également une petite amertume... ca me fait somme toute penser à un barleywine à laméricaine... avec peut-être un peu moins de corps. Lamertume se fait certainement autant présente quun petit côté fumé qui ne démord pas. Pas mon style préféré, mais définitivement une bière complexe qui mérite dêtre essayé au moins une fois.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","LouisP"

Full body and hoppy, strong rustic flavoring of well toasted bread and sharp cheddar. Perhaps my tastes have changed, since the abundance of hoppy beers mean that those were on vanguard dont stick out as much and there is a now more of a desire to have maltier beers to juxtapose hop beer overload. Regardless it is still good, even when past its BBD. Allso, I could go into a meandering rant about Arrogant Brewing and Stone Brewing, but Ill save it.","","balloonbuffoon"

Well, on the one hand, this is probably a fresher version than my prior experience with this beer, making the hops much more emphatic. On the other, Ive had a lot more experience since first giving this a perfect score. Ill be honest: its tough being unbiased here now. Its definitely not perfect - for example, the lacing could be better-defined. But, is that a flaw that justifies dropping a whole point, from 5/5 to 4/5? I dont (quite) think so. Same goes for some of the minor character flaws in the aroma and flavour. And for obvious reasons, some (most?) people will find it too aggressive, while I, as a major hop-head, dont. At the end of the day, Its close enough to perfect that my subjective single point penalty here in the overall doesnt affect the final score. (19/20)","CANADA","UXO"

The aroma is hop forward with some pine and some citrus. Its got a big bunch of caramel sweetness and some bug spray going on there as well. The alcohol is noticeable but not overpowering. Cohesive enough, but not really something I find especially inviting.

2687,"2015-08-17",4.3,"Bottle bought at the BeerTemple, thanks to Ster for keeping this aside. Classic red strong ale with thick, moussy, lacing, light yellowish white head and beautifully deep and warm, orangey copper red colour, clear with quiet fizz, misty with deposit. Strong bouquet of caramel, biscuit, persimmon, toast, gingerbread, dried grapefruit peel, spruce needles, nutmeg, roasted pine nuts, bourbon, dried apricot, walnuts, white pepper, dried flowers, hay, pipe tobacco and green tea. Clean fruity onset, crisp, subdued sweetishness with a light salty edge, red berries, orange peel, smooth body with soft carbo, lovely smooth maltiness, caramelly, nutty and very toasted, bittersweet with a long drying finish of firm, peppery, dried citrus-peel and lightly piney hop bitterness, warming the throat along with a dash of bourbon-like alcohol.

A light citrus aroma gives way to candy sugar, then a light coffee and light woody note comes through with some caramel late - some extra points for complexity. It pours a murky red brown color with a lught brown / orange colored head.

The sticky and slick textured beer has a medium full body and soft, fuzzy carbonation.

2687,"2014-08-28",4.2,"Transfer from BA review on 2-23-13-
 Served on tap in a snifter glass

 Appearance-Served a mahogany colored brew with ruby highlights shining throughout. Upon serving there is a one finger cream colored head that fades rather quickly to leave a persistent film on the top of the brew and a very nice level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is a nice mix of bready malts, caramel, and a moderate hop aroma. The hop while mainly grapefruit citrus in nature is also mixed with aromas of a pine hop aroma as well. 

Taste  The taste begins with a bready and biscuit base with a lighter caramel sweetness. Up front there are also some hop flavors of a pine nature. The caramel fades as the taste advanced with the pine getting stronger and more potent. While the caramel fades, fruit flavors of a light cherry and apple flavor come to the tongue. While the pine levels out in the middle, it is joined by a lighter grapefruit citrus hop flavor. This citrus grows stronger more toward the end of the taste with it, when mixed with the rest of the flavors, leaving a bitter pine and citrus flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel-The body of the beer is on the slightly creamier side with a carbonation level that is a b it on the higher side. The creaminess allows all the hop flavors of the brew a chance to linger on the tongue, while the carbonation level makes it easier drinking and more refreshing. 

 Overall  A quite tasty brew. Its on the hoppier side, but balanced quite nicely by the sweeter fruit, caramel, and more malty flavors of the brew. Its well know for a good reason; its quite a good moderate strength IPA.","","Darkmagus82"

2687,"2014-08-25",3.8,"Just back from France where Ive been drinking lots of Belgian beer, so on my return I really fancied something like a classic English ale. And this is something like a classic English ale. It looks the part; reddy brown with a really good off- white head leaving lacing all the way down. Medium bodied, slightly creamy - could have been pulled from the cask in a small village pub, but was instead imported from San Diego by my lovely local beer shop. Not much aroma. Main flavour is bitterness at the beginning, followed by a bitter middle section and a bitter finish. Beneath that - malt, caramel, grapefruit, and more buried under the bitterness. If this had just been pulled in an English village pub, Id have another, even if only to try and pick out the other flavours lurking beneath the, did I mention, bitterness.

Picked up another bottle the other day for shits and giggles. I wanted to rate this classic and I needed a reminder of exactly what it was I would be dealing with. I cracked it open and poured it into pint glass and right away I was shocked at the massive head of this thing, and it would not go away. You could have built a house on the froth or used the stuff to spackle cracks in boat hulls. I needed a machete to hack through the foam and get to the actual liquid essence of this thing. That is exactly how Stone would have wanted it. The color is a beautiful dark amber with bubbles elevating from minute imperfections in the glass. Resin, pine and hops on the nose. Gives way to toffee and dank malt. The finish is dry and bitter, intense hops at the very end, everlasting on the pallet.

Big rich body, oily, sticky, resiny, lingers long on the palate. Moderately high carbonation.
Palate explodes with big upfront malt; more biscuit and toffee sweetness. Hops cut through with a barrage of citrus rind, dried herbs, cut grass and pine needle. Strong lingering persists, well balanced, alcohol sneaks in pretty much undetected.

A: Pours a dark brown, when held to the light, a toasted orange. Excellent clarity. Less than single finger of toasted peanut head which falls quickly leaving a sheet of the same. Spotty lacing.

S: Piney, resiny hop profile. I take a couple deep breaths and the sweet malty backbone comes through. Brown sugar, candi sugar. 

T: Bitter, arrogantly bitter. Nicely balanced. I know they label this as an American strong ale, but it reminds me of a balls-deep amber with the capacity to satisfy and challange the palate. I rarely skip over the actual adjectives and tote the skill in formation. Pine, bitter, amber, sweet, tea-like hops. 

M: medium to heavy body with low to medium carbonation. Slicks the palate ever so lightly.

The beer is a dark, ruby-ish color. A very nice little head on it with super sexy lacing... a very pretty looking beer, for sure. Arrogant Bastard has a taste not quite like beers Ive had before... theres some bitterness in there, for sure, but its not as intense as it seems a lot of people like to describe it. The hops in this beer mixed with the malts balance it perfectly. Ive had some people try and tell me it tastes/feels ""soapy"", but I dont get that at ALL ... maybe thats because I had it on-tap. The taste is complex to the point where I cant pinpoint exactly how I remember it being, but it was interesting, and it was super tasty... a seemingly wild blend of hops and malt, and I couldnt get quite enough of my sample.

My initial response to a Stone Brewing Company product was ""Wow, I think this might be the best beer I've ever tasted!"". That was the Stone IPA. This is my first try of Arrogant Bastard Ale and after my taste buds stopped screaming ""Uncle!"", my response was ""Ahh, Seven Hells, that's good!!"". The first thing that caught my attention was smell. I knew then that Fate, that sultry mistress with the warm hand and sensible footwear had pushed us together and I was truly in for a treat. The rich head on this beer is the equivalent of a steak dinner at the Buckhorn Exchange. Once the beer hits your tongue it's like a cacophony of flavors. It takes your mind a few seconds to catch up with it. This beer is almost too good.

Hoppy aroma with some pine scents. When you drink it, it starts nice and smooth and sweet with said pine notes and some minor lemony and grapefruity flavors as well, but then you begin to notice the carbonation and the flavor profile quickly shifts to bitter and remains that way for the finish. Its this quick flavor shift quality that makes this beer really complex and interesting to me.

I didnt like it then but was still surprised to find I dont like it now either.  In general, Im a big fan of Stone Brewing and my tastes have expanded to include many extreme and big ales.  This revisit started well enough, with an attractive red-amber ale topped by a small but durable tan head.  The aroma was a slightly boozy mix of medium malt and herbal/earthy hops.

The beer appears a gorgeous hue of ruby tinged sunburst orange. The head is off white and measures a fingers width, leaving some sticky lacing on the sides of the goblet. The aroma offers pine, hops, malt, bread, alcohol. The flavor brings a subtle sharpness, with dank malts and pine resin. Lingering pine and wet hop flavors with a substantial malt body.

S: Some citrus fruit smells, mostly light grapefruit. A caramel malt presence with a light grassy hop undertone rounds it out.

T: A toasted malt body with a slight sweet caramel makes up the body of this beer. There are nice citrus grapefruit and grassy-like hop undertones that brings the beer together. Slight bitterness on the finish. Very good.

The arrogance appears in the first sip with a hit of resiny bitterness that settles into a harmony of balanced flavors: to burnt toast, chocolate, caramel, and an under tone of citrussy hops that remind me of orange/grapefruit rind.  Big body, and a bitterness that is very noticeable but in no way unpleasant.  Finish is smooth and bitter with lingering flavors of burnt toast and grapefruit rind.

The head lingers and leaves thick lacing on the glass; a thin film of head remains throughout and leaves a ring to the bottom of the glass.  I love the nose of this beer.  The hops are by far the dominant force with bright citrusy smells of grapefruit and maybe a touch of orange along with resiny pine.  There right behind it, is a backbone of caramel malt, very sweet and definitely very present.  I loved taking deep wafts of this one.  The taste was hops forward; more citrus and pine note, like on the nose, and blooming on your palate.  As the hops develop, there is a good balance with the sweet malts that keep the hops ever so slightly in check.  The mouthfeel is almost creamy, but not quite, maybe a touch oily with a long bitter finish.  Overall, I have had this beer (along with many others) before I found this site, so I waited till I got it again to give it justice.  I think I had it before I had really developed my palate, because I had not remembered this one as good as I found it today.

I did say Id never have this again after my bottle review, but seeing it on-tap I thought Id do the decent thing and give it another go.

Looked like the bottle version, ruby red and with an off-white head, thin covering and very little lacing.

The smell was sweetish caramel, malts and a splattering of hops.

Still not a huge fan, the flavours dont blend too well in my opinion, the hops dont like the malts and vice versa.

The pint and 6Fl Oz bottle, came to me via Prague, thanks Fred, you know who you are!

Poured into a huge Judas glass and a palm tulip glass, didnt know what to expect, hence the two glasses ready.

A dull ruby red body that had a slight haze to it filled the glasses, a creamy tan coloured head sat on top of each glass, foamy and thick.

Waves of hops and yeast aromas hit my nose, nothing else could get through the strenght of those two ingediants.

The bitterness in the taste from the hops was too much for my wife, I just found it a little overpowering and hid whatever other flavours might have been present.

Glad Ive tried one, will not be bothering with another, it reminded me of a flat Belgian beer I had a few years ago, didnt like that much either!","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

Alcohol is very well hidden; with hardly any warming noticed on the finish.  Overall this is a fantastic brew from Stone.  I have not had this in a while, but it impressed me much more this time around.  Excellent balance; with nice flavor complexity.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

2687,"2012-02-16",4.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/13/2008.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

Being from Chicago, when I was in San Diego I knew that it was imperative to try out some good local brews, especially from Stone Brewery. I saw this one at a liquor store the first night I was in town, and I read the label:  ""This is an aggressive beer. You probably wont like it. It is quite doubtful that you have the taste of sophistication to be able to appreciate an ale of this quality and depth...""  Wow, I would have gotten it based on the name, the gargoyle, or the first line, but this beer is actually daring me to drink it. Ok, I said, lets get a 22 oz bottle and see if I can handle it.

Well, needless to say I was quite impressed. This beer kicks your ass and wonders why you are being such a wuss while taking your beating. 
The color is a deep, dark amber with a thick off-white head that goes absolutely nowhere. As you sip it down the lace reminds you of every level the beer had been at previously. Wow, its hard to make a beer look any better.

Strong hops, a bit of alcohol, strong roasted malt. I definitely smell and advanced bouquet of spices and fruit, with just a floral hint as well. A very complex aroma.

Bam! Arrogant bastard hits you with an assault of roasted malt, bringing a strong flash of caramel at first. The malt also brings forth some chocolate flavors, with just a hint of vanilla as well. Just before the alcohol kicks in, I can taste a bite of cloves, which is a nice touch. From the middle on out, the hops clearly dominate. There is a citrusy fruit taste I cant quite distinguish exactly, but the bitterness is clearly there. Right at the end there is a slight, mild sweetness, with the hops still carrying the flavor.

Although medium bodied, this packs such a punch. The malt adds a chewy aspect to the feel. 

I wish you could session this one. It might take you 20 or so of these to figure out all of the smells and flavors.  As mentioned above, the brewers are not lying when they say this is not for the faint of heart. Dont give this to your friend who you are trying to ween off Miller Lite.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Hoppy, reminds me of a strong pale ale, a hint of iron?

Taste
Hoppy bitterness, IPA-like characteristics, not much malt at all, although one might expect it from looking at the beer. It is nevertheless quite smooth.

Overall
Ive had the Arrogant Bastard from tap before, and I recall quite liking it. Its hoppier than I remembered, and indeed youd think that this is a particularly bitter IPA from just tasting it. The strange thing is that it looks like a brown ale, and the creamy head would suggest something completely different than what you get: in your face hoppy intensity. Stone Brewing makes a case for this beer being something alternative that not many people will like, but actually I think that this comes quite close to some of the stronger and bolder IPAs or maybe Double Pale Ales that are not uncommon in the US.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","Arborescence"

Clear dark amber to reddish beer, nice creamy yellowish head, unstable, little adhesive. Aroma: very fruity, passion fruits, bit piny, touch of wood. MF: soft carbon, full body. Taste: pretty fruity, pineapple, resin, very bitter, bit of lychee, some sweet malts. Aftertaste: bitter and very dry. Meh. You dont make a beer better by just adding more hops.

2687,"2012-01-14",3.2,"[Rated 10/10/2009] Bottle. Pours dark red with a thin head. While aroma is very soft, flavor is rough, very hoppy. Somehow it feels a little overhopped, not the kind thats too bitter, but rather overbrewed and acidic. That is not to say that flavor is dull, just a little different. Overall I am not too impressed, given that its made by Stone Im willing to give it another try some day.","New Jersey, USA","IvoR"
2687,"2012-01-13",4.4,"Ive had this brew several times, and I dont think Ive ever actually sat down to evaluate it.  So, here goes

The distinctive 22oz painted bottle sticks out on the shelf like a sore thumb.  The gargoyle catches your eye immediately.  If you take the time to read the back of the bottle, you endure a few insults, insinuations, and some other comical anecdotes. 

The Arrogant Bastard pours a dark rusty color, and fairly opaque.  The foam is heavy at first, but subsides relatively quickly.  The almond-colored foam leaves behind a fairly heavy lacing.  There is very little, if any, carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass, which surprises me.  At 7.2% abv, I expected more visible carbonation.

Putting my nose in the glass, Im getting some hops, but nothing over-whelming.  Its not nearly as hoppy in the nose as the Lagunitas Hop Stoopid I had last night.  Im also getting a bit of malts, but very roasty, almost burnt malts. 

Once I take a sip, I remember why I never review this beer.  It really is just like they describe on the bottle!  The Arrogant Bastard is mildly hoppy, but well ""balanced"" with some dark roasted (burnt) malts.  I say ""balanced"" because the two dont really seem to balance either other at all.  Its as if you took the oil and vinegar and through them into a pot in exactly the same proportions.  Just because its equal, doesnt mean its balanced.

The malt sweetness is definitely present, but very short-lived.  The hops seem to stick to my tongue for hours.  The brew overall is kind-of rough, strong, and I dont know, the exact opposite of mellow, smooth and balanced?!","Connecticut, USA","TheCorkStops"

I mean really, besides what everyone else has been writing about this beer, what more is there to say?  Compare it though to some of the extreme hopped beers that we see today and AB is rather tame and quite frankly mundane.

En finale, les houblons sont parfumés et sexpriment par de belles et longues morsures.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

The aroma is tantalizing, with fresh hops and some slight, roasted sweetness. The taste is not as mellow and complex as the aroma; it is mostly piney and bitter, with less of a roasted-malt backbone than I had imagined. It is still good and full, but based on the aroma I was expecting a lot more. The aftertaste overstays its welcome and is, unfortunately, a bit unidimensional.

This was my first craft beer and my last for quite a while...I wasnt worthy.  Living in SD, this beer is everywhere, from your local supermarket to kegs at house parties.  Ive had it many times, but this is my first in at least a couple years.  This is definitely not the best beer in the world, even though it thinks it is.  It has all of the hard-to-get-right details down: dark ruby pour; nice foamy head; full bodied; thick, sticky texture; bitter finish...it is a pioneer for a reason.  However, the initial aroma is not at all inviting, Ill call it pungent.  There is something in the hop profile that just doesnt appeal to me (overripe fruit, perhaps).  Whatever it is, it makes its way to the tongue and even to the aftertaste a bit, and it ruins the whole experience.  Oh well.  If you hand me this beer, Ill happily drink it, Ill even enjoy it; I love what Arrogant Bastard represents, I love Arrogant Bastard.

2687,"2011-03-07",3.2,"Poured into a snifter. The oaked version of this was my first true love. Back then, a beer like this was as rich and flavorful as they come. Seems like those days are over though. The last Oaked AB I had didnt have the effect it did those years ago given the amount of good beer Ive put down and the growth of my palate since.

4.5 A: Clear deep amber/mahogany color. Nearly three fingers of beige creamy/frothy hybrid head. Average to good retention and plentiful nonuniform lacing.

3.5 S: Caramel, brown sugar, and even a touch of nuttiness. Hops add pine, orangy citrus, and a touch of flowers.

3.5 T: The taste is still aggressive enough to warrant a name like Arrogant Bastard. The first thing I noticed was a decent hop bitterness punch. Orange, grapefruit, and piney hop flavor. Good amount of caramel and toffee malt flavor with a general biscuity maltiness.

3.5 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Smooth, but could be creamier.

4.0 D: I was glad I had a bomber. AB is a solid beer and a good introduction into the world of higher ABV, more flavorful beers. While now it doesnt impress me like it once did, drinking it again takes me down memory lane when craft beer could not have been any more exciting.

Its a stone product for sure when it comes to the hopping and that is the first thing you get in the nose big old pine and citrus hops. The pretty much dominate the nose.

I would say that it is clean in h sense that it kept my mouth tingling. Overall I would say that this is a good beer but not a great beer. I felt like the complexities and the pleasures in the taste were somewhat diminished by the discomfort caused by the bitterness.

2687,"2010-09-22",4.7,"Living in Kansas, I dont often have the opportunity to get great fresh beer from the coasts.  Sure, we have access to big breweries like Sierra Nevada, Rogue, and Samuel Adams, but we dont have access to those ""chic"" breweries.  One such name is Stone, a brewery that Ive always admired from afar but never had the opportunity to sample.  On a recent trip to Denver I made it a point to seek out a bevy of beers that I just cant get here locally, including several from Stone.  For tonight, I figured that I may as well start with the beer that is arguably Stones most famous, Arrogant Bastard.  I have to admit that Im both nervous and excited to try this beer.    This one is a 22 ounce bomber, with the famous Stone Gargoyle on the front.  As if I wasnt intimidated enough theres the phrase Youre Not Worthy greeting me as I crack the bottle open.  

Im treating this beer as I would a Belgian, as surprisingly outside the name I know very little about it.  So that means that Im using my Chimay chalice.  Blasphemy you say?  Well, considering the name is Arrogant Bastard, I figured it appropriate.  Pours similarly to a Belgian beer as well, a deep amber color.  The color is the first thing that surprises me about this beer, as its much darker, bordering on brown, than I expected.  Half inch head that dissipates but leaves a fine bubbly lacing along the sides of the glass.  Nice.  

Aroma is surprisingly malty.  Considering Stones profile (i.e. California, I was expecting this to be quite hoppy, but again thats not the case.  Its a complex smell, and my first thought was of pretzels, like the big soft pretzels you can get on a street corner.  Theres some sweetness to the malt aroma as well, kind of like a French loaf or something similar.  I want to say that there are some faint fruit aromas, like figs or other dark fruits.  This aroma is just fantastic.  I could smell it all day.  

Mouthfeel is pretty tremendous.  Its thick without being syrupy, full without being sticky.  While the hops were not present in the nose theres this super huge lingering bitterness that smothers your palate, choking it from the front to the back with your first drink.  And again, the Arrogant Bastard surprises me, as it tastes like nothing I was expecting.  Theres this huge, full-on malt sweetness up front, which gives way to a dryness before heading into the bitterness at the end.  I attribute the middle dryness to house character that seems to be present in all of Stones beers.  When tasting the beer Im surprised at how fruity it really is, as I get these huge hits of raisin and fig on my palate.  Whats amazing is how the sweetness just evaporates in the middle, giving way to this dryness and then the big bitterness.  Its a really incredible feat to move from the sweet to dry realm so quickly.  

This is a Belgian beer without the Belgian yeast.  Arrogant Bastard only gets better the longer you let it warm up.  The fruit flavors and malt profile are amplified the closer that it gets to room temperature.  Its a delicious beer, and I can easily see why so many people enjoy it.  Overall Im quite impressed with it, and I have absolutely nothing to add but wow.",", Missouri, USA","VengefulOdin"

2687,"2010-09-03",4.5,"Bomber. Pours a cloudy dark amber color with a thick, bubbly layer of light brown head. The aroma is caramel malt, herbal hops and orange citrus. The taste kicks off with lots of toasted malt and caramel flavors followed by intense bitterness, resinous hops and sour grapefruit. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and creamy with a citrusy, alcohol warming finish. The hops are assertive and aggressive throughout but are always kept in check by the malt.

The creamy head does not last.. but leaves a decent amount of lace down the glass. The flavor is a crisp, spicy hops with a distinct sweet malting. Mild acidic taste, but that is balanced well with the hops. The body is full and rich with a crisp clean feel. A faintly sweet, mostly bitter somewhat dry finish.

This is, without a doubt, the finest beer on the market.  The ONLY reason I didnt give it a 5.0 is because the bomber bottle taste falls a little flat to me (as opposed to draught).  Get this from the tap and you will stay until last call.

Alcohol? Whatever. Tastes good, of course, a little citrus, pine and caramel to compliment the nice lingering hoppy aftertaste. Dry enough.

Pours a deep, hazy amber brown, very cola-ish, with a small thick beige head that recedes to a hefty cap and leaves some clings streaks of lacing.

The aroma is very hoppy with bright citrus, including lemons and tangerines, and some floral pine.  There is a light malty sweetness in the background but the hops are dominant in the nose.

The hops lead the charge in the taste as well with bitter/tart lemon zest up front.  The backbone is malty with lots of caramel and toasted malts.  But the sweetness is swept away again in the finish, which leaves a dry hoppy bitterness.

The mouthfeel is bitter, dry and prickly with the bright citrus leaving a nice coating on the tongue.  Moderate carbonation and medium body overall.

This is a very tasty beer, especially given its relatively low ABV, and the hops are the main attraction here.  Id probably prefer it a little more balanced but thats not exactly Stones style.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

pours a beautiful red amber, with a thick light tan head that fades into pillows and leaves great lacing all over the glass.  ive always considered this one of the prettiest beers available.  deep, grand smell of piney and citrusy hops mixed with a great, complex malt character, featuring a nutty bread but mingled with a roasty character.  taste is kind of like that, but a bit fruitier, with a grape character and an earthy note joining the complex malt and hop interplay.  finishes moderately bitter with a perfect lightly sweet malt balance.  medium thick of body, great, abundant, big carbonation (not champagne big, but not exactly creamy, either), that makes it feel bubbly and tingly.  this has the features of some of my favorite stand-bys (e.g. great lakes burning river), but the crystal is toned down, and theres a dark malt note that really shapes this one.  stone sure does know how to make a beer!  this is a favorite, and i must make it a point to drink more of it!","pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","hiddenvariable"

Appearance: The beer has a beautiful dark ruby red hue with good clarity and a creamy light tan head. The thick creamy head has good retention and slowly fades to a thin cap of frothy foam. From this head I get lots of cool lacing and lace rings on the glass.

Smell: It has a big juicy citrusy hop presence over nice bready maltiness in the background. 

Taste/Palate: There is a good solid mix of bready, caramely, grainy malt with loads of juicy of citrusy, grapefruity, lemony, and piney hop notes. The hops bring solid bitterness which slowly fades off the tongue deep into the finish. The palate has a firm yet still easy drinking texture with active carbonation and a good solid medium to full body.

2687,"2010-04-30",4.2,"You have to have a lot of respect for a beer that flatly states on the bottle Youre not worthy and You probably wont like it. As someone who has be ensconced into the craft beer scene over the last year I understand where Arrogant Bastard Ale by the Stone Brewing Company, is coming from. It is indeed a strong beer for discriminating tastes and if you can appreciate good beer youre bond to love it.POUR, COLOR AND AROMASince this is only available in 22oz bomber bottles, the beer pours rather rough with plenty of kickback. It forms a beautiful shade of clear but dark maroon with little carbonation noticeable. Its complimented by a thick, frothy, tan head which lasts throughout the life of the beer and leaves generous amounts of lacing on the glass. The aroma is surprisingly subdued with hints of a strong hop presence with some floral notes but also a distinct maltiness as well.TASTEI have never experienced a beer with such a continually-changing flavor as I have with Arrogant Bastard Ale. Upon my first swig I noticed a taste of deep sweetness like caramel and chocolate  reminiscent of a doppelbock. However, on the finish I noticed a distinct hop bite with a mild citrus and pine flavor. This was very unusual and pleasantly surprising since it seemed to be a combination of the best of both worlds: sweet malts and bitter hops.This beer is classified as an American Strong Ale, which I suppose would make it an American take on the Belgian strong ale style. Whatever the case may be I definitely enjoyed it since there was a strong presence of everything here  malts, hops, sweetness, bitterness and more. Although, the more I drank the more I noticed the beer began to take on the qualities of an India Pale Ale with a strong citrusy taste and a wicked bitter bite. As something of a hop head myself I really enjoyed this, but couldnt help but wonder what happened to that rich caramel sweetness from the beginning.FINISHWith a name like Arrogant Bastard Ale, you might assume this is going to be a difficult beer to drink, but nothing could be further from the truth. With a very soft, gentle mouthfeel and a rather thick composition, this is actually a very easy-drinking beer. The only caveat is the strong, dry, chalky aftertaste not unlike flour. BODYThis is a heft beer to be sure. At 7.2% ABV and a slogan that tells you that youre not worthy, its no surprise that Arrogant Bastard Ale packs a punch. I drank my bomber after dinner and still felt its effects. This is definitely not a beer for lightweights.FINAL THOUGHTSWhile I wouldnt consider Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale one of my all-time favorites, or even among the best of the best, it definitely does live up to its name and reputation. As an amateur connoisseur I could definitely appreciate the craftsmanship that went into this brew as well as the strong, complex, and delicious palate. In fact, I might even take some pride in knowing how much I really like this beer. Perhaps the name is meant to describe those who like it more than the beer itself.NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de4RzKp1FpE","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

2687,"2010-04-26",3.4,"A- Nice deep red/amber body with thick creamy head.

S- very malty with hints of hops. I thought the smell was rather pungent.

T- I had a bomber of this and everytime I sipped I noticed something different. There was obviously a hoppy finish that remained on the palate. The hops all together were good but the aftertaste was a bit unpleasant. There are subtle hints of dark fruit and chocolate and of course a nice malt backing. What I liked the best about this brew was a nice spicy flavor that lasts thrroughout it. Carmel can be noticed when there is a great length between sips.

P- well done. medium carbonation and medium weight body. Feels good in the mouth.

O- it was different. Not an everyday thing for me. One bomber is enough for at least the next month.

This beer is above average overall-but a little bit over hyped. There are hoppier, more complex, not for the ""faint of heart"" brews out there. This just didnt live up to my expectations. I will probably have it again. I do not hate it nor am I in love with it.

I have had it before, back in the days I didnt rate, but its lovely to re-visit. Arrogant Bastard is a crystal-clear mahogany ale that is quite sparkling and is adorned with a small, rocky, light coloured head that is mostly diminishing and leaves thin lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is mostly of grapefruit from the hops, followed by rich malt that is slightly sweet. There are hints of nuts, resin, plum, honey and vanilla. It is medium-to-full bodied with slightly soft carbonation. It is ever so smooth. It is well-bittered, lightly sweet. It starts citrusy and turns wooden. The aftertaste is on the long side and exhibits notes of oak, pine and juniper. The balance is superb. This really hit the spot.

One good whiff and you get a nice hint of hops. There was also a slight bit of fruit in it as well. I couldnt really detect what fruit it was but it seemed like a neutral fruit like apples. When you taste it, the frothy head is the first flavor to hit you with a followup of hops. In the middle, you get a hint of barley and it finishes off with the hops again. I didnt get the taste of fruit like I initially smelled. The aftertaste of the brew is pretty alcoholic, though. I did not perceive the texture as very smooth. The flow of the textures and tastes didnt really transition that well and I thought it was a pretty generic beer.","Long Valley, New Jersey, USA","dekeq"

Semi-sweet fruity malts upfront, which quickly turns to a very flavorful pine and citrus hop middle, before ending with waves of bitterness. Detect some spiciness from the hops at the end as well.

Low carbonation with a full, very smooth body. Finishes quite dry.

My first American Strong Ale, but I really like this and want more. Good thing its a bomber and I am only half done.

The colour is lovely red/amber and glows invitingly like burning embers, the head is big and creamy and sits a god half inch above the top of the glass without falling over the side. The first thing Im struck by is the maltiness of the aroma, after hearing how hoppy this Bastard was meant to be, I was surprised. The aroma is malty, roasty and heavy with bread and also with some delicious citrus creeping through, then in to floral hops tasty. The flavour is absolutely delicious, however, I am blown away, and I mean BLOWN AWAY by how controlled the hop action is... The hops ride along playfully on a tidal wave of biscuity red malt only ever becoming bitter as it reaches the back of your tongue. Amazingly well balanced! But the characteristic I adore most is its sensual, soft, creamy full body. Stupendous beer and far more elegant than I had anticipated from this well known brewery.","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"

Flavor is, as noted, an assault on the palate. Pleasant fruit and malt with a hint of chocolate and a noticeable burst of alcohol to start and then bitter, bitter bomb of hops on the roof of the mouth to finish. As it warmed, the booziness was more focused and less pleasantly integrated to where it overwhelmed. Interesting effort, but Not my favorite.","Littleton, Colorado, USA","alagnak"

Poured from a awesome looking bomber. That insulted me several times while reading the back story. I loved it. Its a deep red brown color with a wee bit of head. I was expecting more head but, Im not that concerned about. The aroma is faint but,there. I really had to get my nose in this one. It smells of citrus and hops. The taste was wonderful. Theres the initial bite of the citrus hops and nice caramel smoothness that makes this very drinkable. The mouth feel is pleasant with a decent heartyness moderate carbonation. 

Overall this is a winner in my book. Im not a hop head by any means but, if this the gateway to bigger and stronger hop flavors. The door has been kicked wide open my friends.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","beerwolf77"

A good amount of nutty grain maltiness, lots of thicker fruit notes such as apples, pears, and melons, a good earth of earthy and bold citrus hops.  It definitely smells stronger than 7.2% abv.  Pour was nice as well, with a medium sized creamy head, good retention, and caramel crimson in color.  The taste is well balanced, and the flavors come out quite nicely.  Lots of malty fruitness to back up the thick offering of hops.  Main players on the flavor notes include earth, nutty caramel cereal grains, a good amount of medium fruit salad, pine, and thicker citrus bitterness that lingers better than i was expecting upon initial sip.

Aroma:  Buiscuity malts, earthy hops.

Taste:  Huge amounts of bitter, metallic hops head straight for the back of my tongue. Just a really minute level of malt sweetness is there, but most of the malt I taste is close to bready, rather than sweet.

Mouthfeel:  Heavy and thick for sure.

Overall:  Im worthy, but this is a tough sell. I can appeal to many audiences, all for different reasons.  I give this beer extra credit for hooking me on Stone.

The taste like the aroma was pretty simple yeast, hops, and grape fruit that blend together for a creamy taste. The moth feel is soft and tangy and there is a bitter after taste left in your mouth.

Grassy dark malt aroma up front; strong molasses-like smells. Sweet like caramel candy or maple syrup. 

The flavor is rich and complicated. Strong carmelized sugar flavors in the beginning of the sip. The hops crecendo slowly and powerfully. I am fascinated with the experience after the swallow: the molasses sweetness returns followed by an intense IPA-like hop bitterness. This beer has a body like light cream. The higher-than-typical carbonation provides the perfect foil to nearly overwhelming flavors. 

This beer offers one of the best carnival taste rides: malty to hoppy to candy sweetness to dry hop bitterness. Id love to know how they made this beer. Its like drinking a symphony.

Really well done strong, flavorful ale. Love this one. This was really the beer that got me interested in the Micro beer movement and sampling new beers.  I remember ordering one of these on tap when the Capital Ale House opened in Richmond, VA, and just loving it, and I still really enjoy it today.

2687,"2009-04-25",3.9,"Im no arrogant bastard, but apparently that is one of the required personality traits one needs to even try to be worthy of the enjoyment of this particular offering from Stone Brewing. Of course, I am referring to the Arrogant Bastard Ale.


My Arrogant Bastard Ale poured rustic amber with copper hues, rather befitting an evening outdoors watching the burning crimson orb shrink below the towering mountains. A head peaks nicely with a mix of big and small bubbles striving for attention. Swift swirls inspire scattered lace along with a short-lived revival of her puffy head. Rising with the night mists is an embracing presence of sweet fruits, caramel and toffee, roasted malts and warm bread, grass, orange, peaches, and grapefruit. Carried away in a delirious fog of sensory delights, I savor our first quaff as I clutch her bounty close. Arrogant Bastard is definitely hop-forward, soaking my tastebuds in dry grass, hay, and bitter-sweet grapefruit esters. Faintly sweet and pleasantly sticky, my mouth waters after each hoppy quaff now overflowing with multiple varieties of ripe grapefruit. As she warms, pine needs and sap tingle on top of my tongue which, despite her rather sticky nature, is enjoying a growing sense of dryness. Offering silent support from the background is a quiet strength of toasted malts and rich whole-grain breads that are laced with faint notes of honey and orange. Arrogant Bastard that she is, our time is over when she decides and well, I guess her decision has been made considering my glass is empty. All that remains are vivid memories of fresh grapefruit, sweet pine, sticky sap, and dry grass balanced perfectly with toasty malts and honey.


A small part of me feels a twinge of guilt every time I say Arrogant Bastard Ale, but I swiftly squash that little voice with a flare of indifference. We all have our inner arrogant bastard which must be embraced from time to time. The brewers at Stone Brewing may embrace theirs at all times, but if such delicious works of brewing are the result, I really cant complain.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

2687,"2009-04-05",3.6,"22oz bottle. Pours a polished red-brown body with a thin, beige to tan head that leaves a good amount of delicate swirling on the surface and runny lacing on the glass. The aroma is initially a wave of of earthy and spicy citrus hops before it opens up and concedes to sweet, berry malts. Lots of caramel. The malts are abundant, but never smell thick or syrupy. A touch of toasted toffee. Very nice. A light booze note reminiscent of most strong ales, but definitely hidden with the berries. Much more of a sweet aroma than anything else. The flavor is no where near as sweet as I thought it would be after experiencing the aroma. Starts off with a distinct, moderate earthy hop taste that never goes away. Lots of soft malts as well initially. The berries and caramels come through more in the middle and the hop flavor starts becoming very bitter and earthy. It conitinues to grow and becomes even more bitter in the finish and even more yet during the lingering aftertaste. The intense earthy hops kind of give it a ""dirty"" taste...not that thats a bad thing. A nice citrus, sour grapefruit comes through as well. The caramels are both sweet and toasty. A balanced combination of the two. Not boozy at all, but has that ""strong ale"" taste to it in the end...but maybe thats just the intense hop bitterness that doesnt seem to go away. Palate is medium bodied, extremely creamy and clean for such a bitter beer, and a bitter duration unlike anything Ive ever come across. Overall, an intensely hopped beer. I mentioned it tasting dirty earlier and with a name like Arrogant Bastard, I think they picked a damn perfect name for this cavalier. Pretty cool version of a strong ale for sure. I liked it a lot, but it just didnt rub me as much as some of the other highly hyped beers Ive tried lately. Despite that, it was delicious.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Why a score of 5?
Because,when i find a beer, that in my opinion,defines a style i give it a perfect score.Aroma is a mix of piney hops and roasted malts.In good light it is a dark ruby red with a nice tan head.
Flavor wise it is a solid mix of bitter hops and varying degrees maltiness as it warms up.Very tasty! Medium palate which makes it very drinkable.(maybe my taste buds are dead because of too much IIPA)As far as i am concerned this is one of the best beers in the world which fits the strong ale description perfectly.If i was stuck in an elevator and had a dozen of these i could stay in there for quite a long time before i would start to panic.","Laval, Quebec, CANADA","lalu"

UPDATE: 11/11/09 On tap at the saucer. Pours a heavy red hue. Smell is of fat pine dripping with heavy heavy hops.

Strong grapefruity smell dominates.

The initial blast of flavor is of strong grapefruit followed by hops. The malts show up very briefly but are indeed present. The carbonation is a bit strong for my taste but works well with the tangy grapefruit notes.

Overall it is a fine example of the style. I could not have more than one in a sitting that is for sure. It is complex in many ways and is a must have for American Strong Ale lovers. I am more of an Imperial Stout man myself, but can definitely appreciate what this brew has to offer.

An inexperienced beer peon may easily mistake this as an IPA, however it has enough balance and character to qualify as a strong ale.

Battle of hops and malt on the nose and tongue, with both sides bringing out their big guns.  Some may feel caught in the crossfire.  Tons of malty caramel and citrus/resiny hops.  Some notes of wood, butterscotch, toffee, biscuit/cookie.  Ends with crisp hop bitterness. Despite the bottle’s challenge to make me feel man enough to like this beer, it really is over the top.

2687,"2008-06-30",3.5,"Its true. Im not worthy. I bought this beer with very high expectations. Bottle pours deep cloudy amber, with almost no crown at all. Smell is good, with hints of slightly piney hop amid woody earthiness. Taste is the deal breaker. What is hinted at in the aroma knocks you back in the mouthfeel. Hops aplenty gives you a kick in the teeth with medium sweetness and a bit of citrus following. Bitterness sticks with you for a while. I dont think Ive had a beer this thick and hoppy at the same time since I tried Smuttys impy stout in the big beer series. Bottom line: Im not the guy that disdains everything that someone else likes so he can feel superior and elitist. Im the guy who appreciates the artwork but probably wouldnt hang it on his wall.

Medium head, lightly colored, disipated slowly.  Dark red color to the beer.  Powerful floral aroma backed by citrus notes is amazing but washes out the malt aroma for me.

The taste didnt disappoint either--medium full to full body, quite malty-sweet with a touch of grapefruit and something else I cant put my finger on when it first hits the tongue, giving way to a malty-bitter finish. If it has any shortcomings, it may be that the aftertaste lingers a touch too long. Other than that, its a strong, bitter, but very drinkable behemoth of a beer. One of my personal favorites.","Ft.

Its a malty taste, a little bit of dark berry with some bitterness, but not overly bitter. A bit of hoppiness as well. Lots of flavor to this beer. The finish was the best part for me, it sticks around for a while and thats not at all a bad thing. American ales dont get too much better than this.

Update (06.28.2008) - Had this again tonight, and its still as perfectly balanced as I remember. You really cant go wrong with this beer- super hoppy for an American ale and super enjoyable for anybody who enjoys beer.","Lincoln Park, New Jersey, USA","Underhook"

Appearance: Dark, bold, clear, rusty orange-red with magenta highlights and puffy parchment-colored head with great retention.

Flavor: Much more malty than the smell (but still predominantly hoppy); a well-balanced ale. The hops are mostly grapefruit pith with a grassy character. Finish could be a bit cleaner, but on the whole, this is one yummy beer.

Palate: The beers finish is ultimately crisp, dry, and hoppy, but it starts off strangely sticky and cloying. Other than that, no complaints. Smooth mouthfeel.

Some dark fruits, but mostly like eating burnt caramel on the bottom of the pot.  Nice sophisticated palate, fluffy medium/full body, slightly syrupy.

I was able to distinguish the AB apart from the oaked version and it was alot easier than I thought.  Heres what I found with regular AB.  Pours amber with large off white head.  Aroma is of caramel, sweet malt and hops.  Flavor has a nice bite to it but not overwhelming.  My opinion is the Oaked is far better than the regular AB but I liked both.  The regular version is more agressive with its strong malt and hop flavor.  It also has a stronger alcohol flavor whereas the oaked is more balanced.

Ive put down quite a few bitter and high-ABV beers in my time on earth (and hope to have many more in my remaining time!), yet I still find this beer a bit difficult to drink.  It is a substantial beer, and while I like the strong hop bitterness, there is a robust maltiness that when combined with the hoppiness feels like a punch in the mouth to me.  I might have enjoyed it more if I had not been having it with food, and if it were my first beer of the evening rather than my 3rd and final one.  Appearance is surprisingly red and head is sturdy.  Aroma is serious hoppiness (with some nice fruity under-tones) and a substantial maltiness that comes across as to me as metallic, caramel-y, and bitter in a non-hoppy way.

2687,"2008-04-20",4.6,"22 oz. bomber. Pours a magnificent reddish-amber with a thick beige head. Perhaps my favorite beer appearance-wise. It smells sweet, but the hops are present too. The nose also has a ""burnt"" character to it, and the malt also shows itself in the odor. If the aroma was just a bit more potent, it would be perfect. The flavor is extremely floral with loads of delicious hops along with raisin and pear. Some caramel sweetness is also present. Light to medium bodied with a little carbonation. Nice bitter, warming finish. This is actually one of the first craft beers I had tried a while back, and it really took me by surprise at the time I tried it. I was skeptical and didnt really like it as the label suggested I wouldnt. I was coming off of Molson Canadian as my favorite, and that probably explained the not-so-pleasant palate assault. However, I gave some other craft beers a try, got hooked, came back to this beast and now it is definitely one of my favorites. I buy it time and time agian.

Full-bodied and creamy with a dry, bitter, resinous finish. This is easily the fullest bodied beer that Ive sampled with an ABV below 8%.

Fresh outdoor, earthy hops aroma.  Heavy textured body that tastes precisely how it looks.  Heavy hops with a powerful nose bite that lingers in the throat after a swig; the alcohol flavor seems to come primarily after the swig.  Notes of grapefruit; oak-ey earthy flavor settles with the brew in the stomach. Descent lacing.  Im a bit disappointed, but only because of the hype.  Nonetheless, this  is a damn good beer.  Great for a pale ale lover.  The alcohol content is pretty warming after 22 Oz. too, which is nice.

I think the aroma out weighs the flavor this time around.  Pretty bitingly bitter without the hop flavor complexity that I hope for in hop bombs. Bumping this one down from 3.9 to 3.4.

The nose begins with citric hops followed by tart cherry, orange zest, plum and cocoa.  In the mouth it is medium-bodied with good palate weigh and rich midpalate that fades to a dry hoppy finish.

Typically, I drink it in an ill-lit bar, and in those instances my impression has always been that its sort of a well-balanced double pale ale.  Now I see that this puppy is pretty dark and malty.  The hops are still there, and its far from an extreme brown ale, but its tough to categorize the real balance of it between malt and hop.

The taste didnt disappoint either--medium full to full body, quite  malty-sweet with a touch of grapefruit and something else I cant put my finger on when it first hits the tongue, giving way to a malty-bitter finish.  If it has any shortcomings, it may be that the aftertaste lingers a touch too long.  Other than that, its a strong, bitter, but very drinkable behemoth of a beer.

This beer has so much hype I just had to give it a chance. Aroma was very complex... a nice balance of malt, copious amounts of citrus and pine hops, and a fruity note. Stones marketers we definitely not kidding when they wrote the discription for arrogant bastard... the first sip of this brew literally attacked my palate. I wasnt expecting nearly the hop content as this beer had, but it was surely there. Despite an astringent first sip however, this beer mellows out significantly after a minute or two. It eventually evolved to be very smooth and drinkable. I would be interested to find out the IBUs on this monster, but I can only guess it to be 80+. Malt character is great too; very balanced and drinkable. Alcohol content is definitely present, but not as much as one would guess for the 7.2% abv. It remained well balanced throughout, and is another winner by Stone.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"

Rerate: 22oz bottle.   Deep red color with a lasting beige head.   Earthy caramel, tea, pine, and grapefruit in the aroma.   The flavor has some soil, caramel and damp tea leaves, with bitter and piney hops in the finish.   The caramel almost overtakes the bitterness of the hops, but falls short in the end.

First taste is a beautiful complexity of barley, hops and malt in a nearly perfect harmony. I would like to see the malt toned down a hair, but thats just me. In fact, the temptation is to just keep drinking this in order so enjoy the drinking/savoring/swallowing/aftertaste  experience, but, given the 7.2% alcohol content, this probably wouldnt be a good idea on a weekday morning if you are a school bus driver.

Strange taste to this.  Would really like to have a fresh bottle.  This may be old.  Sorta hoppy and a little malty.  Most of what I get is kinda like paint thinner smells.  Pretty bitter finish which I do like but not as hoppy as I was led to believe.  

Still a good beer but I have to admit, I was a bit let down.

Many Belgian qualities make themselves known throughout this beer... such as the spice, raisin and sweet malt characters.  Nice medium body and smooth over the palate with a bitter back-end and finish.  A very high quality brew with a very unique name and story on the bottle.

The predominant malt flavor is spice and caramel, and it is balanced very nicely by a subtle piney hops kick.  This ale is very smooth--I didnt even notice the 7.2% alcohol until I finished the 22 oz. bottle.  This ale is very expensive--$40 for a case in Southeastern Pa. where I live.

Went down about the same way,  lots of grapefruit and a bit of malty goodness.  Hop bitterness lasted for ages with a nice dry finish.  Wish this could be a session beer for me,  maybe some day...


UPDATE! And today is that day thanks to Iowa finally carrying stone. This beer isnt that good. No grapefruit to speak of. Malty goodness in a strong hoppy beer? Gross.

At first I thought they bottled some IPA in the wrong bottle.  Afterwards you get a little bit of burnt malt and hints of chocolate.  The taste itself is very hoppy up front and the malt hits you when its sliding down your throat.  Very enjoyable.  Perfect level of carbonation makes for a great mouthfeel.

The smell is strongly of hops, mostly pine-oil and fresh cut grass. The taste is very malty, not nearly as much hops as I expected from the smell. The upfront taste is all caramel malt with a lot of sweetness, and then the hops hit you at the end and a couple seconds after swallowing the bitterness from the hops and the alcohol warmth lingers in the back of your throat.

Great balance, but still aggressive, the result is something between styles.  Enough hops to get a good bitter finish, but still sweet.  Im more of a hoppy, non-sweet kind of hophead, but this is one is balanced ok, and doesnt overwhelm my sensitive sweet tooth.  I usually drink this as an after dinner drink, or after mowing the lawn.  Pours a deep amber with an off white fluffy head.  I can smell the sweet end of the malt, but its followed by fresh hops. Yum.  Drank this one at about 45 degrees f, and it was just about perfect.  Grapefruity finish, good hop bite that something with the title ""arrogant bastard"" should have.

A touch of alcohol.  An intial taste of fat strawberries and cream is quite charming.  Massive resinous hops power through with a syrupy punch.  Toasted malts and sweet orange juice round a classic interplay of strong ale benchmarks - most intelligently executed.  Smooth, textured, green palate with a predictable hit of oaky heat.

2687,"2007-08-25",3.9,"Poured from 22oz bomber - dark, clear brown/copper with highlights of dark amber and a huge tan head that leaves loads of lace on the glass and fades into a thin, persistent, unevenly bubbled pad floating on the beer. The aroma is hoppy, but is also very nutty and full of caramel. The hop smell has hints of pine needles tossed with lemon grass. The taste starts bitter and sweet - a nicely balanced, albeit firm, hop bitterness combines with a complex malt profile - some chocolate, caramel, biscuits fresh from the oven, vinous malts, and roasted grains. The middle of the flavor picks up strong flavors of roasted grains, nuts, and chocolate along with a mellow citrus bite.  The hop flavor grows after a few mouthfuls - a mix of earthy, spicy, and citrusy bitter flavors mix with the hearty malt backbone. The back of the tongue picks up more chocolate and nutty, brown malt with more citrus bitterness. A fruity character also grows as the beer nears the back. The finish is long and surprisingly dry, its very hoppy, and it leaves an after-taste that resembles the flavor: lots of hops and lots of dark malts. The mouthfeel is sudsy and creamy (though not quite ""luxurious"") and medium- to-full in body. Overall, an interesting and tasty beer.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Nice lacing all the way down the glass.  The aroma is a very nice blend of caramel, herbal hops, toffee and biscuit.  As appealing as the aroma is, its the flavor that really steals the show here.  Simple yet intriguing, the taste tiptoes down the tightrope between overt bitterness and supreme craftsmanship, settling on the latter.  This beer has a very whisky-like profile in its masterful blending of caramel, toffee, and biscuit, three of the classic whiskey tastes.  The hoppiness of this brew approaches perfection, as any more or less would certainly throw off its near perfect balance.  Medium body that goes down smooth and leaves behind a lingering bitterness.

The initial flavor was moderately sweet and lightly bitter, while the finishwas light to moderate sweetness and heavy bitterness (citrus hops) with a long duration.

This is a real sum of its parts near-sessionable beer--its considerably better than looking at the individual elements on their own merits might suggest. It starts off promisingly enough, dense and mahogany brown with a thick moussy tan head. Looks kinda beasty. Nose is virtually nothing at all, though; a little sweet malt, maybe caramelish. How they hide the hops in the aromatics is beyond me even as I sit and type this. The bodys full and the carb is there; the flavors are reasonably strong so the attack en toto is assertive enough. The mid-palate doesnt seem to carry much oomph, really; theres raisin and caramel and maybe a little light toast. The finish, though, is an awesome blast of rich resiny hop that just ties it all together. Every drink is satisfying, if not huge or complex.

Arrogant Bastard poured a deep, dark ruby with a 2 finger creamy light tan head. The moderate lacing is good and sticky. This beer glows when held to the light. The glow of this beer adds a lot to the appearance along with the lasting head.

Smells juicy. There is a great big grapefruit bitterness smell. Its strange but I also pick up celery stalk. I never noticed that in other bottles Ive had. Theres a solid malt backbone thats actually pretty complex. Some lightly roasted grains and white toast among other, less aromatic, aromas. As it warms alcohol fumes rise into my nose.

Oh, the taste!... Toasty grains and mild caramel make the initial appearance. The malts fades to the background as the delicious bitter grapefruit hops take over the palate. After a strong bite the hops simmer down to a moderate bitterness and the grains come back for a night cap with a stronger showing of the caramel the second time around. The bitterness lingers around for a little while after each drink. This beer isnt polished. There are a lot of rough edges that go together seamlessly. Alcohol fumes come through as it warms and they just add more complexity to this drink. Lots of interesting flavors. Very nice. 

Mouthfeel is good. Medium bodied and very smooth. Leaves with a little grittiness. Carbonation keeps it pushing through and the tongue takes a beating from the big amount of hops. Just the way I like it.

Drinkability is good for the fact of how good this beer actually tastes. I dont think Id want to drink much more than a 22 in a sitting but it definately is good.

2687,"2007-05-11",5.0,"This beer says what it means.  You probably wont like it.  Unless you love, and I mean LOVE bitter beers, the aroma is heaven, to hop lovers, its an amber, beautiful amber color.  The smell is like people are hitting you inside of your nose.  And when the beer hits your pallet, oh my god...its like a punch in the face.  I recommend everyone at least try it once, it will change your life, it changed mine.  Well...beer wise it did.","Levittown, Pennsylvania, USA","bbp182"
2687,"2007-05-10",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2007 The back of the bottles describes this as an ""aggressive"" beer, I was curious as to the meaning of this. After one taste I immediately understood and was instantly hooked. This is one of the best ales ever to pass my lips. The flavor is so complex it was like the fourth of July in my mouth. I cant wait to try their other brews. //12-7-07: Ive enjoyed a number of bombers since my initial review including one tonight. This brew is one of the first beers that really lead me to the craft beer craze and for that I am very thankful. Some additional comments in regards to this great beer to complete this review. Pours a dark, burnt copper color with a very large tan head and sticky lacing. A very aromatic hop scent is emitted into the air. Bitter citrus with caramel and sweet breads. I cant believe how well the aroma permeates the air surrounding the top of the glass. Creamy on the palate with a nice bite and puckering finish. Medium bodied and filling. Grand flavor of resinous hops and roasted, sweet malts. A touch nutty, grapefruit and spruce. The flavor sticks to your ribs and assaults the senses. Overall a nicely aggressive and flavorful ale, still one of my favorites that I look forward to returning to every once in a while. A sentimental beer that deserves its rating.""","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"
2687,"2007-05-09",3.6,"UPDATED: AUG 22, 2007 Pours a deep vermillion with moderate carbonation, a slight haze and capped with a full, tan head. Heavily malted nose with an alcohol presence that cant be covered. Pepper, pine and tart citrus show in both aroma and flavor. Peaty and dry for the most part, with a heavy palate.
Agressive? Indeed. Sophisticated? Not really... it is what it is... a strong ale with heavy-handed PNWs, high IBUs and thick malts to back them up. Id call it a DIPA. The ""arrogance"" implied thru its flavor-text was probably considered a sweeeeeeeet marketing technique, but it annoyed the f*ck out of me. Ill drink this if its offered but Im not going to seek it out...  Im ""not worthy"", dont you know.  If I truly want an arrogant bastard, Ill call my buddy Gene.

2687,"2007-04-13",3.8,"22 oz. bottle purchased for me by iradog on his trip to Colorado. Thanks, Ira! Aroma of piney and citrusy Pacific Northwest hops. Smell also possesses a pronounced sweetness, featuring cherry and chocolate scents. Aroma similar to that one might find in a barley wine, but it could stand to be a little stronger. Pours an impressive, dark, amber/ruby-brown with a golden-amber hue and a small to moderate amount of yellowish tan head. Looks like pure cranberry juice or liquid clay in the glass. Produces extensive lacing. Bitter hops dominate the flavor, despite the fact that the beer looks and smells as though the malts would be stronger in the flavor profile. Grapefruit and other citrus flavors deriving from the hops are evident, but the English-style dirt bitterness is what sets this beer apart from so many other American strong ales. Improves after multiple sips and as it warms. Long, satisfying, dirt-bitter aftertaste. Medium to full in body. Tangy and sharp, silky but lively in the palate. Easy to drink for a relatively big and thick brew. The mouthfeel to some extent stands out more than the flavor in this beer. Arrogant Bastard is a good, solid, bitter spin on the classic American hops-dominated ale.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

2687,"2007-04-08",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 4, 2009 22 oz. in quart Mason. Deep mahogany that is a clear, ruby red when held to the light. Medium large, tan head lasts fairly well with some crusty lacing. Aroma is fresh and prickly pine hops with grapefruit and some malt support. Initial taste is surprisingly not so hoppy, and very smooth. Hops still dominate this beer -  pine resin, dirty leaf, oak and light citrus - but the big malt body balances it pretty well with some dark fruit tastes. Very luscious and creamy, medium-bodied beer. Pretty two dimensional, but still a nice beer.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
2687,"2007-04-07",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2007 This, for me, is the brew that opened the door into the microbrew world...based on the name alone.  It is red-brown and clear.  The aroma and flavor are certainly hoppy, as one would expect, but it is not unbalanced.  Unfortunately, the mere existence of Double Bastard renders it virtually obsolete.  But, then again, the relative availability between the two knocks Arrogant Bastard back into relevancy.","Chester Springs, Pennsylvania, USA","RoboHop"
2687,"2007-04-07",3.3,"On draft at Nicholsons in downtown Cincy.
Served in a pub pint glass.
Has a dark gold/brown color with a huge two inch head. That is frothy and plenty sticky. There was very good lacing that covered the entire interior of the glass throughout drinking.
Smell is mostly bitter hops, with some citrusy notes coming through slightly. Taste is bitter but refreshing at the same time. Mouthfeel is somewhat astringent but enjoyable at the same time. Becomes a little cloying after a while.
Its a very good offering on draft, however I think I could only drink a two pints of this at most. Would tire of the taste after that. Would highly recommend, a little more ""relaxed"" than served from the bottle.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AllAboutStout"

The head was nearly three fingers and off-white, not quite tan.  Rocky foam sat on top of this one the entire way down the glass.  Rings of lacing.  The aroma was a nice mix of sweet malt, roasted malt, citrusy hops and pine.  The flavor was caramelly sweet up front with citrus and piney hops leading into a succinct, dry finish.

Has a medium thick head with lots of bubbles and a tannish overtone to its head. The carbonitation is great. The in mouth feel is medium light, not thick or syrupy. It does have a bit of a floral hoppy aftertaste but in general is smooth all the way around. After number brew 2 you either hate or love it.....I love it.

Prominent hops - spicy floral and just plain old bitter. I start to think about them but the malt takes over. Sweet with dark caramel, more dark caramel, and then some dark caramel. Theres a fruitiness in there too - like a dried plum (which sounds nicer than prune). Anyways, lets go with complex hops and complex malt. All in perfect balance - assuming you want a balance weighted towards hoppiness. With big malt. There is a spicy (white pepper) hops with faint licorice (from the malt) aftertaste.

2687,"2006-12-26",3.2,"22 oz bottle.  I am annoyed by beers like this.  Its yet another overrated, over-hopped Stone brew with no real uniqueness or defining character.  Appearance is pretty much perfect, though; pours a dark garnet with a big, frothy, tan head; decent lacing down the glass.  Aroma is heavily floral and hoppy; some caramel and nuttiness.  Flavor--not surprisingly--is hops, hops, and hops, with a little sweet malt and grassiness as an afterthought; its 7.2% alcohol by volume is not evident; an hour after drinking, brushing my teeth followed by gargling with Listerine wont get the bitter aftertaste out of my mouth.  Medium bodied with medium carbonation.  This drink is utterly lacking in the balance department and is drastically overrated, in great part because it says ""Stone"" on the label.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sfontain"

Arrogant Bastard Ale is a deep reddish-copper color.  It has a very large, fluffy, and creamy tan head that has a nice lacing effect on the glass.  The aroma has a sweet maltiness and some fruity hoppiness that hints at whats to come.  This beer has a wonderfully balanced flavor of sweet caramel malt and fruit/citrus/pine hop bitterness.  The finish is also balanced between a moderate sweetness and orangy hop bitterness.  The bitterness of this beer is ""aggressive"", but quite well controlled.  There is no alcohol in the aroma or flavor; its completely hidden.  The mouth feel is a bit thicker than average, quite creamy, and very smooth.  22 oz bottle from Josephs Beverage Center.  Rating:  8  4  8  4  17 = 4.1

I gotta hand it to Stone...  All their beers are great, but its amazing that such a well made beer with an elevated alcohol content like Arrogant is so widely available and so reasonably priced!_________________________
Double Dry Hopped Cask Conditioned Arrogant Bastard Ale 
I managed to get a 0.3 L glass of this special beer at ""The Most Arrogant Bar (Pub) in America 2006-2007"" event at Bostons Bistro & Pub (Dayton, Ohio) on 2/22/2007.  This was supposed the the first firkin of Stone Double Dry Hopped Cask Conditioned Arrogant Bastard Ale ever made.  It was double dry hopped with Centennial hops...
When first pumped into the glass, the Double Dry Hopped Cask Conditioned Arrogant Bastard is nearly all head.  Eventually it falls out to reveal a mostly clear amber colored beer.  There is still a substaintial creamy beige head that lasts the entire time.  The head also some ring pattern lacing on the glass.  The aroma reminds me of sweet clementines with a bit of bitter orange zest.  The flavor was fairly dry and reserved.  The usual huge maltiness and obscene hoppiness of the regular Arrogant Bastard was replaced by a smooth, moderately dry and bitter flavor with a bit of earthiness.  Lighter mouthfeel than the original as well (medium to medium-full overall).  The palate was soft, smooth, and creamy.  Quite good, but why mess with the original?!  I feel privileged to have been able to try this rare beer...  Rating:  8  4  7  4  16 = 3.9.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"

First thing that hit me is a touch of sweetness then instantly it is balanced out by a huge kick of hops but nothing overbearing. Grassy, piney, and spicy hop flavor with the sweetness being fruity and toffee. Thicker mouthfell is always appreciated.

Hops take center stage, and have some grassy, peppery and piney notes. Malt backbone of dark fruit and caramel. This is the benchmark american strong ale for me.

Alcohol VERY well-integrated........  There is literally a gap of a couple seconds between the last of the flavours and the the wave of bitterness in the finish.

Really nice, frothy mouthfeel off the top, with a big huge hop and malt blast, though actually in good balance with one another despite the size of the attack. Piney, earthy American hops, with the thick malt character standing right behind the massive hop front. The finish is a bitter assault from The Gates of Hell, and it just goes on and on and on.

22 oz bomber
Recent brewing, argued over 10/06
Medium pour in a tulip glass

Poured dark ruddy brown with a medium sized mostly lasting fizzy off white head.

Smelt of strong citrusy lemon lime hops, some light piney perfumey hops as well,   with light sweet caramel tones. Pineapple candy overall.

Taste was upfront strong grapefruit and moderate pine, with light nutty maltiness, followed by a dark breaded maltiness, somewhat bittersweet, followed by a second front of hops, this time harshly grapefruit in nature, followed by an herbal, tea-like bitter hops, licorice, and the same sweet gelatineous lingering finish.  Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, slightly creamy, fizzy and moderately astringent.

Overall, the nose is spellbinding, the appearance good. The balance of hops to malt seems such to enliven the hops, but to not let it get overly out of character.  Perfect in that sense.  The finish is rich with flavors, but I would have liked to see a bit more complexity on the foretaste though.  Excellent overall.","Midland, MI, Michigan, USA","xav33"

The taste starts strong, has great flavor, smooth, crisp and finishes off actually somewhat bitter.  Pretty dry for an ale but definitely worth the buy every single time.  This has to be one of my favorites, always coming back to it, anyone who likes a good ale definitely should lool forward to this.  It is quite a treat.

The brew pours a deep cloudy amber with a small but thick head.  The aroma is smooth and hoppy.  The taste seemed smoother then normal, smoother then when I typically have this beer, it is possible that this happened because I had a red ale right before this beer but I cant be sure.

The nose is heavily citrus hop, predominately grapefruit with hints of pine.  The taste is obviously strongly hoppy - detectable once again through a  huge grapefruit explosion.  But, wait, is that malt I sense?  Yes! - there is some malt lurking somewhere here - perhaps caramel but Im not positive - adding some semblance of balance to a beer that probably didnt even need any.

Smell is of hops, but not overpoweringly so; really a subdued surprise here. Taste is a combination of both floral and fruity hops. Most pronounced are the apricot and pineapple flavors that are also found in the regular stone IPA. The major differences of this beer are a darker color and a bigger bitter, more varied taste. There are indeed aggressive hops added to the mix that give a really nice bite. The aftertaste is more bitter hops and fruity sweetness; both well disguise any alcohol that may have been lurking. So thats the Arrogant Bastard, not as daunting as I had imagined it would be, though certainly a worthwhile beverage with a confounding compilation of hops.","Gardners, Pennsylvania, USA","99beerman"

This is one complex mutha! it pours a very deep amber hue with a really nice frothy head which  you can expect to sit on top your beer for the entire drink. Under the right conditions gigantic pillows of lacing will form on the sides of your glass letting you know that this is one bad-ass of a beer.

Some people say that this beer is overrated, I beg to differ, I proudly drink my Arrogant Bastard because to me the dark complexities that are hidden in all corners of this brew really drive this beer in the right direction. This is a complex beer with nice dark fruit flavors such as raisins and prunes. The complexities only grow as your palate adjusts to this beer and it gets a bit warmer. I like mine at room temperature - maybe a hair colder. This beer is quite hoppy, but not in an aggressive IPA way, it just has a buttload of hops to help even out all of the maltiness.

Flavors in turn are definitely all about the hops here, but the sweetness of the malts balance things out very nicely. Starts out with somewhat semi-sweet dark wheat bread, smokey, fig flavor, but quickly transcends into a big, crisp and bitter hoppy long finish.

2687,"2006-05-08",3.8,"I only recently returned to serious homebrewing and beer enthusiasm after close to a decade of basically settling for what I could get at the local Trader Joes. While plenty familiar with the old-school, west-coast originals, I was thus way behind the times when it comes to the great second-generation (1990s) craft brewers, not the least of which is Stone. The whole gargoyle motif and ""arrogant bastard"" tude never really did it for me, but Id read so many good things--and more than that, Im a proud SoCal guy wholl firmly believes in thinking globally but drinking locally--that I finally had to get with the times and try this stuff.

Bottom line: good but not great. Im just an old-school guy, and the over-the-top, IBU-flooded bitterness is just not for me. I love the fact that a Stone exists and that theyre willing to push the envelope, but for me, the defining factor of a great beer is balance and harmony. While Arrogant Bastard offers that in its wonderfully inviting, strong but not overpowering, aroma--sweet and citrusy, that I pegged as grapefruit at first but then became more mango-like, with a very pleasant floral hop background--the flavor is just too bitter. As the beer warms, the complexity begins to come out in the background, but its still dominated by the raw, even harsh, bitterness of the excessive hops--kind of like a good piece of music being overpowered by the bass being turned up way too high. If only the bittering hops were turned down, allowing some of the sweetness of the malt to come through, this would truly be a great beer. Or maybe it really is a great beer, and Im just ""not worthy"".","Los Angeles, California, USA","californiapete"

Flavor is very bitter with an explosion of hops of all types and with a strong malt backbone that is almost kind of smokey/earthy/coffee-like. Cold, this was just very bitter, as it warmed, so many more dimensions came out and the palate was much richer. Overall its really very good. Although it is pricy, at least in NJ.

2687,"2006-03-23",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 27, 2007 I dont know, maybe Im not worthy?  Poured a very deep cloudy brown nutty fresh pressed apple juice.  Head was two finger frothy dark tan that stuck around about four minutes before leaving a thin tan film.  Did leave a very nice lacing.  Aroma was caramel, dark fruit, and a nutty coffee.  Flavor was initially intensly malty, and it really threw me off.  Below the malt were lots of hops with lots of citrus, some sweet dark fruits, and maybe even a very sweet maple syrup.  There was a tinge of spiciness, but not too pronounced.  I really thought the malts were a little too much, and made me work to get to the underlying flavors, but then again, maybe thats the point.  As it warmed, I must say, the hoppy flavors, especially a deep orange came out.  Finished this thing an hour ago and its still on the back of my tounge.  Palate is a light cream/syrup with moderate carbonation.  Theres no question that this beers a beast, but it really is one Im going to have to revisit to get a true understanding of.  Definitly a good brew.  Im just not sure what to make of it.

Revisit 2/26/07:  My ability to appreciate this one has increased significantly.  While the taste has remained unchanged, Ive gotta say I am picking up much more of an initial hop onslaught, but followed immidtaly by the sweeter flavors named above, with hops finishing  things off and lingering for quite some time.","Washington DC, USA","gallaghermurph"

Hops are predictably big and lasting, with a woody maltiness. Mouthfeel is nice - heavy and creamy - and palate is interesting, with notes of caramel, flowers and citrus. Something about this combination didnt work for me though. The malts were too heavy, stifling the freshness of the hops, or something. Kind of like a good English strong ale and good IPA mashed together. Tasty, no doubt, but a little awkward.","Washington DC, USA","theacelatrain"

Pours a cloudy, murky iced tea brown with a small tan head that leaves boatloads of lacing.  Looks like I just had a root beer float!

Very dark hazy pour, with a medium head that spider-laces the glass from top to bottom.  Full-bodied, bold caramel malts paired with aggressive hops supply an extreme bitter back to the pull, really filling up the mouth.  I taste notes of pine needles, pepper, citrus, spice, thai, caramel, cinammon, ginger and bitter hops.  This beer definitely sticks to the palate for awhile.... its got a long, hoppy finish.  It is drinkable, very much so, but also quite complex.  My only issue might be that the complexity is somewhat lost on the backend, as its linger turns a bit simple, especially after the front pull offers so many interwoven hues.","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"

2687,"2006-02-14",3.6,"22oz bomber. Poured deep clear amber-brown with a HUGE, lasting tan head--wasnt able to fit nearly the whole bottle into an ABA footed glass. Very enticing aroma: moderately hoppy with some definite malt character as well. Flavor starts off with deceptive sweet bready malt and rapidly gives way to resinous hops and distinct alcohol. The flavor profile seems more distinct to my young palate in small sips (some prune, more balanced malt character, faint vinous notes). Finish is long, moderately dry and quite bitter. I love bitterness in a strong ale, but this finish strikes me as bitter to the exclusion of other flavors and sensations. Very substantial body on the palate; texture is a bit oily but not in a bad way.

Perhaps, as the label suggests, I lack the sophistication to appreciate this beer, but I thought the aroma and palate deserved a more balanced flavor or at least a more interesting hop profile.","Berkeley, California, USA","ghorsche"

Overall, the hop bitterness vastly overpowers the malt, making this one dry and acutely bitter.  The hops also provide a fruity character, mostly citrus and pineapple, but reminiscent of all sorts of tropical fruits.  As it warms up, the malt gains strength and holds off the bitterness, but also the other hop character, making it actually a bit less enjoyable.  Also, I found a bit of a sawdust flavor.

Pours a dark and robust brown with amber highlight and an adequate head. This beer is almost a caricature of a Stone Brewing beer - not that this is a bad thing.The aroma is a brash and in-your-face combination of strong PacNW hops and conspicuous toasted malts; the taste follows as expected, avoiding the heavy hop + too-dark roasted malt mistake of many American strong ales (particularly the winter seasonals). No war between hops and malt here, both hold up their end of the bargain. The palate is pleasing, and beer is very satisfying to drink. A good in-your-face session beer, this one.

I picked up an arrogant bastard one night because it was the best that the store had... I had really forgotten how great AB is.  It has a good punch that the Double bastard doesnt have.

2687,"2005-12-03",3.7,"For my first Stone brew Arrogant Bastard seemed like a natural choice especially as a base for the double and aged variants. The standard Stone bottles have a great personality and attention to detail, it was a joy to crack open and pour. The hue reminds me of a dark chestnut color that shines red-orange in the light. A frothy pale yellow head sits uncomfortably above the liquid and leaves sparse bubbly lacing on the glass. The aroma first strikes as powerful and very hoppy, with grapefruit dominating the first whiff. With closer inspection a blend of cherry, red apples and banana strike the nose while coffee, cream and a slight woody note provide a soft balance. Sweet fruity malts hit the tongue initially but soon the hops override the main flavor with a touch of smoky spices. Im not a big hop nut myself but I enjoyed the change from my usual Belgian preference. The aftertaste leaves a long Sahara-dry hop flavor that sticks to the back of your tongue forever and encourages another sip. As far as hoppy beers go, I do appreciate the complexity but it is always hard for me to enjoy the overpowering bitterness.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Hazy deep copper with a beautiful tan head that clings wonderfully to the glass. Bready caramel aroma with the faintest spicy hops peeking around the corner. Full malty body that coats the tongue with caramel, toffee, and flavors of roasted malt. Faint hop flavors of grapefruit and peppery spice give way to an astringent  bitterness that balances the massive malt perfectly. The bitterness lingers long after youve set the glass down.

2687,"2005-11-23",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2007 Imagine how surprised I was to one day find my own nickname on a beer bottle.  The picture on the label is a poor likeness of myself, but I can forgive the artist for his creative liberty in adding horns and a chiseled, devilish chin to my normal features.  Still, stunned and somewhat flattered by Stone Brewerys clear admiration for my distasteful personality I purchased the bottle and walked out of the store with my newfound chin high in the air, and a kingly swagger in my step.  At home, when I poured the ale I learned why it they had chosen the great and wonderful me as their cover art.  Arrogant Bastard Ales color is absolutely passionate.  Imagine a blood drenched Saigon sunset, like a fire burning in the jungle night, like a tiger burning bright.  It is absolutely resplendent.  The foam leaves something to be desired, but under that is the glow of fire & brimstone, glimmering in the deepest cavernous bowels of the Earth.  I was almost too busy mesmerized by the color to even take the time and pick apart the aroma.  There, I scrounged up a bouquet of flavors bound by a hazy smoke.  Nose pleasers like licorice, banana and apple wafted up from the glowering brew and enticed me to finally stop staring at the chalice like a buffoon and actually taste the beer.  The taste is something akin to a pleasurable whiplash; a rickety theme park ride with a spontaneous, unexpected beginning and a long, drawn out end.  It starts with a loose collection of sweet fruits, some slight hoppy grapefruit and a tender, creamy mouthfeel all overshadowed by a dark smoky flavor.  It finishes with a long, persistent screech of hops.  The sheer hoppiness of the aftertaste compels you take another sip to reintroduce theinitial burst of sweetness in a vain attempt to dispel the wracking hops harshness.  The process repeats again and again, ad infinitum  a terrible purgatory. But then, before you know it the beer is gone, and suddenly my grandiloquent, magniloquent, pompous, vainglorious, Arrogant Bastardliness is shattered leaving a semi-inebriated, cowering fool.  This is, indeed, a demonic beer.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Luckly, this beer isnt crap... far from it.  It looked very sexy inthe glass.  I remember it being similar to an imperial pale, if there was such.  Very good, and will drink again to get a better idea.  Kellers IGA","Columbia, South Carolina, USA","slang"
2687,"2005-09-04",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2008 bottle. For some reason, this is the most available high alcohol beer in Knoxville, TN, so I have it every now again when theres nothing new to drink. After drinking a few hundred different beers since I last approached the Bastard, I realize now that this, I think, is a great example of the mythical imperial red ale style. Aside from the attractive dark red pour, that sweet biscuity-breadiness is also predominant. The hops are steady and even throughout. This is just a solid, big beer. It goes beyond merely being a hop bomb and delivers adequate sophistication for a satisfying beer consumption experience.


[Nov.24, 2007]

 Here I am again drinking the old Bastard. This is a very solid beer, I get desensitized to its quality from time to time since I consume it so often, but damn, this is a good beer. The beer selection in my county is abysmal, but thank God we get Stone for whatever reason. Again Im reminded just how cleanly hoppy this stuff is. Its not off the charts, but man, its assertive. Excellent citrusy, sprucy acidity highlights sweet, biscuity, caramelly malts. This is a real American amber ale with some juevos.  

[December 20, 2007]

 I think I forget just how good this beer is. Its hard to find another similar beer that pulls of this kind of flavor with such finesse. I retasted Double Bastard just a few days ago. Id like to note that I might just prefer Arrogant Bastard due to its crystal clear hop profile and commendable balance. Its a tough call.

[August 5, 2008]

Bomber from McScrooges best before August 30, 2008. Damn right. I  havent seen a fresh Stone beer on any shelves in my area for a few months, pissin me off. Finally I got my hands on a new Arrogant Bastard. Pours cloudy amber with thick lacing and a firm white head. The aroma has crystal clear grapefruit, some pine, thick biscuits, caramel, lemon, earth. Carbonation is medium high, just a little spritzy, and suits the flavor well. Now this is a true American beer. Loads of PNW hops, thick biscuity malts, no regard for subtlety. The level of balance in this beast is quite a feat. This is one of those ASAs that really doesnt belong in another style. . .kind of sets the bar for other similar beers.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
2687,"2005-09-02",3.9,"Bottled at GBBF, August 2005. I must confess, I didnt find this as arrogant as I expected. In fact, I thought it was relatively restrained and subtle. No shrinking violet certainly, but not the loudmouthed show-off Id been expecting. Perhaps Im just getting more accustomed to these big US beers so they dont have the shock factor that they once did. The aroma was surprisingly malty, with the fat hops bubbling under. The grapefruit and pine hoppiness built up in the mouth but there was still a solid underlying malt base and hints of caramel.  Quite refined and very satisfying.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
2687,"2005-09-01",4.1,"Bottle. Now this is beer. Pours a lovely red-orange-brown with a good off-white head. Aroma of hops and... canned pears? The palate is smooth--the flavor is anything but.

Damned good brew, but definitely not for the faint of tongue.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

2687,"2005-08-30",3.9,"Ok I can now imagine what melted caramel and an IPA would taste like all mixed up together.  I had a 22 oz bottle of the Bastard, and though I *thought* Id tried it before, apparently not.  The aroma is sweet, not floral but that of sugar and candy.  I think its one of the best smelling brews Ive tried, to be honest.  Color is a nice dark copper/red/amber hue with a medium-thick, creamy head upon pouring.    And the taste...very bitter at first, but after 3 or 4 sips it just turns sweet...and more sweet...with a hoppy, lingering finish.  The alcohol is there, but not too much so.  I love bittersweet chocolate, and I will use the word bittersweet to describe this one, but its not even close to the same animal.  Its bitter, damned sweet, and good!  The only detraction to me is the almost syrupy, slightly cloying mouthfeel.  I expected it, Im just not crazy about it.

Ill admit, that the first couple of sips were HARSH, but then it became more appealing as it warmed.  It has great deep red-brown color and a thick caramel head.

2687,"2005-08-20",4.1,"22 oz bottle.  Hands down one of the prettiest looking beers Ive had in a real long time, a undisputable 5 in appearance.  Poured into a pint glass with a perfect frothy off-white 1"" head, the color is amazing.  At the narrow base of my glass it appears ruby  and turns a deeper tawny color as it nears the wider upper part of the glass.  Aroma is great, balanced wonderfully between malt and hops, some toffee, some resin, some floral tones.  On the palate it feels oily and full bodied, with some distinct alcohol warmth.   Only downside for me was the finish, a bit to harsh and rather medicine like.  Not that it was too bitter per se, but just a little harsh.  I picked up a case of this today and Ill be very interested to see if the finish changes over time.  This is one you should seek out.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Lots of light spice, lemon and herb.  Nutmeg?  Coriander?  Ginger?  What is that underneath there?  Tasting gives you a timid entry, then blows you away with prolific hops and malts.  There is a caramel complexity to the beer that takes you to the river where there is more citrus on the finish, and several minutes later, perhaps, the ride is over.  Fantastic, true ale.

Wow. Big malt but a very very hoppy taste comes right after. Wouldnt have expected it to be this big from the aroma. Very full bodied malt with an extremely assertive hops profile. It would sound like this beer is just a one-dimensional big beer but its actually very well balanced and complex. There are alot of strong flaovors in here (sweet malt, caramel, hops and spice) and they all complement each other wonderfully. On top of all that, its just one ass-kicker of a beer, in ABV and big taste. I am always suspicious of ""gimmicky"" ad campaigns but Arrogant Bastard is a perfect name for this brew.

2687,"2005-05-08",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 9, 2005 22oz bottle.  Served at 53.5 degrees in my NB worthy glass. Pours crimson red with a cream colored head. The head laces and there are plenty of tears when the beer is swirled. The aroma is malty, with some bright hop notes. The tasty is initially malty, almost brown sugar caramelly followed by a piney hops flavor, with some good bitterness, not too much, but you certainly know its there. The mouthfeel is pretty full for this type of beer. It is good, but not great, a bit of a dissapointment so far. I have tried to update my rating twice tonight, but the site is giving me the shaft, so I will write this addentum for the third time. Tasted at 63.5°. The hops are more in the mix in the aroma, it is much better at this temp. The flavor is nicer, too, it is almost more like a bigfootish-barley wine.

For a relatively old sample (bought ~10 months ago), the smell was quite fresh.  Sugary and resinous hop aromas made me think of a cross between a Barleywine and a Scotch ale.
It came down like an easy drinking Barleywine, too, having the complexities I like, but with restrained cloyness and not too boozy.  Its malty, chewy and has a light, almost crack caramel flavor.  The aftertaste is an interesting amalgam of sensations on my tongue; its candi sweet on the tip, the bitterness bites you on the sides and on the gums, and the back is bone dry.  Nothing takes command, nothing overpowers, no nerve endings get scrambled.  Ive scarcely encountered an american Beer over 7% with this much balance.

Strong fruity and spicy hop aroma with a biscuity malt backing.  Full body, aggressive from nose to finish.  Seemingly super chewy mouthfeel caves in before barelywine levels of chewiness are reached.  Spritely hop astringency matched with enough syrup malt character to keep everything assertive, but in check.

3-20-2006
Bottled.  Nice rich mahogany color; clear and sparkling like champaign.  Off-white, almost beige head--fully lasting, smallish to medium; nice, thick sheets of lace leaving behind a lovely, balanced patchwork.  The aroma is exciting for me: it smells similar to an IPA; its simple, but very nice.  Honey, honey-comb, fruity, floral hops, the slightest touch of pleasant juniper bushes and some mild, sweetish wheat-bready yeast.  The mouth on this one is more pleasant than that of the bottle--with its warnings and naysayings.  Fullish, lots of rich, foamy carbonation, yet the mouth retains pleasant liquidity; noticably dry.  Flavor: honeycomb malts, touch of sugar, not very sweet--its a natural kind of sweet, like unsugared strawberries.  Hops are introduced and finish with considerable, enjoyable bite.  Grapefruit RIND, very bitter rind, pine, juniper and all three mix into a pungent finish that introduces and covers the alcohol.  Theres some yeasty undertones throughout; tastes much like what it is: unreacted yeast.  Its lightly wheat-bready and pleastant though, mediating between your palate and the hops.  Some floral hops are tastable as well, complementing the yeast and further blending the hops with the malts and creating the ""honeycomb"" flavor.  ...loved by few...  Not all aces in my book, but masterfully done.  Powerful; pleasant.","Reno, Nevada, USA","0o9i"

In the end the beer itself is another west-coast Cascade dry-hopped pale ale, with a little more character than Sierra Nevada.

I found the initial flavor to be sweet with nice chocolate, caramel/molasses, and cedar wood malt flavors.  The sweetness, however, is replaced quickly by a strong pine resin flavor that continues to grow and lasts long after beer meets belly.  An interesting mix of flavors and an enjoyable beverage!

The title in itself is excellent, it encapsulates my entire personality in two words.  So theres a special connection right there.  Extremely strong and bitter but with such elegance / grace.  As I drink beneath the bottleneck, I cannot help but notice the complexity.  Upbeat hoppy and sweet flavors initially dominate, with dark chocolate overtones bombarding the palate afterwards.  Haha, through the halfway point, I turn the bottle around and read the back, and it provides an ignorant comment to the non-sophisticated beer drinkers of the world.  Good stuff.  It honestly gets better as you get to the bottom.  More hard and more dark, but never lets the alcohol intrude upon the rich flavoring.  An excellent beer, throughly enjoyed, one that will be definitely sought after in the near future.","USA","Loddeer"

Lovely caramel, cookie dough, and vanilla malty flavor backs up an assertive grapefruit-citrus hop aroma. Flavour is fantastic, sweet toffee and caramel malts on the front fading to a strong alcoholic warming character before the citrusy and earthy herbal hops flavours make an appearance. These fade out leaving an awesome bitter kick in the teeth. As this beer warmed, you got even more citrus hop character and some spicy and fruity maltiness on the nose. Truly a first rate beer.

Take a sniff...Spruce resin, orange flowers, malty malt, WOW! This is like taking a hit from a 6 foot bong! Its an aromatic orangatuan climbing up my nose, and playing my ole-factory like a jungle gym. The dryness outta shrink my head fast enough to make a headhunter cry with joy as he decorates his tent post with my shriveled, devil-puckered up mug. Astringent but not aseptic; this big beer has plenty of expression. In a Barry White voice this beer says to my taste buds, ""Hello taste babies, Im gonna make love to you."" The taste babes are passing out all over my mouth. What a hit! Theres a little smoky, and a lot of sweet malt. A citric rind-like burn on the top of my mouth. This brew is so warm, feels stronger then it says. Man its taut in the mouth like a live wire with all those hops. Theres enough malt to fill your mouth though. Dont be worried about being bored with this munster. The beautiful thick, velvety, steamed milk froth is clinging all over the glass like sex juices after intercourse. What happened in that mug?  I suggest:
Sip and chug your way through 2/3 of a bomber, then kick back and let it warm up. As it warms up you should find yourself contemplating all the naughty things you want to do to satisfy your lover. Sip the last third of this brew saying those things with your eyes. This is a McNasty beer that will have its way with you, and you should share that feeling.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","gabbledbabble"

Flavor opens up bitter and spicy, and then the rich and roasted character appears again with a nice layering of hop flavor and finishes with a malty sweetness. This beer is so unique, the flavor profile is really unlike any other beer I have ever tried. Mouthfeel is medium to full and leaves a slight sticky coating on the throat, warming as it goes down. Arrogant Bastard is incredibly tasty, drinkable and in my opinion a nice session beer... cause frankly you cant drink much else after the havok this wreaks on your pallate.","San Diego, California, USA","Hopgeek"

Both versions reek of hops and malt (the way a good beer should) and hold their heads well, the bottled version more so.  Both have a clear, antique gold color.  The draft version allows one to better appreciate the complex malt recipe, including a sour mash flavor (the old Guinness trick).  Both have deep, well extracted hop flavor, the draft version has less aromatic flavor, again favoring its palate.

The nose was full of prunes, vanilla, alcohol, floral hops, citrus fruits and a malt undertone.

Sharp hops at first followed by flavors of prunes, apricots, caramel and light toffee. Hops are dominant but the malt presense is very high too and balances well. Hops still take over this beer and make it very bitter. Excellent mouthfeel as well.

2687,"2004-09-12",4.6,"This beer pours deep dark brown; held up to the light it presents itself as dark, opaque amber. Develops a rich, bubbly head that swirls as if it were the portal to whatever hell the label character has come from. The head itself is a yeasty bread colored cloud of bubbles that lasts acceptably long and leaves a lot of intricate lacing behind. Aroma is sweet and malty with hints of yeast, alcohol, sweet fruits, hops, maple, and cherries. Port like characteristics and notes of apricot brandy fill the nose of this fragrant ale. Just before tasting I noticed a spiral of yeasty foam in the center of the glass; it looks like our galaxy, or maybe a hurricane. Whatever else it may look like one thing is for sure, it looks inviting! Flavor? Okay, this is a bitter beer; the aroma is deceptive because the smell and taste of this beer are two very different things. While sweet malt dominates the aroma hops and alcohol dominate the palate. Flavors of grapefruit, vodka, pepper, tobacco, and HOPS!!!, stand out in violent opposition to the sweet aroma. It only takes a moment to get used to the bitterness at which time you realize how perfectly the aroma and flavor compliment one another. The alcohol hits you with a giant sucker punch about 1/2 way through the glass and then all is truly good. As the beer warms the flavor profile changes and more subtle malt flavors begin to emerge. This is cigar beer 100%. Some piano jazz, a fine maduro cigar, a box of dark chocolates, and a few bottles of Arrogant Bastard sounds like the perfect evening to me.

Flavour is fairly bitter with what lots of a quality I attributed to humulin but I am not sure. Not as hoppy and bitter as I expected. Heavy aftertaste seems a bit off at first but is less noticable after a few belts. Nice mouthfeel, a bit thicker than average. This is a bit of an adjustment. I had high hopes for this one and while good it was a bit of a disappointment. I have a second bottle so we shall see how it compares. Thanks to Callie for the pick up in California, and to the Ratebeerian who brought one to Dougs place. 7/3/6/4/15","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"

2687,"2004-07-12",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 23, 2007 Deep ruby-brown beer with a thick off-white head.  Aroma is lovely, biscuity malt, caramel and toffee with a sweet grapefruty citrus malt.  Bitterness is much more restrained than the last time I had it.  Sticky with a soft resinousness on the back.  Palate is good, but the sweet malty aroma doesnt really come through on the flavour very much.  Not as good as it used to be, but still excellent.

Dark ruby coloured beer with a thin skin of tan bubbles over the surface.  Lovely caramel, cookie dough, and vanilla maltiness backing up an assertive citrusy hop aroma.  Flavour is fantastic, sweet toffee and caramel malts on the front fading to a hint of coffee/chocolate character before the citrusy and earthy herbal hops flavours make an appearance.  These fade out leaving an awesome bitter kick in the teeth.  As this beer warmed, you got even more citrus hop character and some spicy and fruity maltiness on the nose.  Truly a first rate beer.

2687,"2004-06-23",0.9,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2008 I appreciate good beer.  Ive had over 500 different kinds since I became a SERIOUS beer drinker.  However, this concoction is just a bit too over the top for me.  The label warns of its ""aggressiveness,"" and touts that anyone who is not a REAL beer drinker ""probably wont like it,"" thereby, subliminally at least, making everyone like it for fear of being called a wimp.  Well, I  can tell you with certainty that I am no wimp, and I have had much better beer than this.  The taste is not what bothers me; rather, its the pungent aftertaste that reminds me of Robitussin that appalls me.   I had to eat an apple while drinking this thing to keep from vomiting (and remember, I have had Buffalo Butt), so that should tell you something.  (And after paying almost 5 bucks for a pint and a half, youre damn straight I was finishing it.)  So, go on and tout your love of this potion; I will go on enjoying my more mellow blends that have less to prove in terms of how ""manly"" they are.

Strong alcohol taste, but thin enough for the hops to get through and bite you, while giving a smooth malt taste.

It has not remained as high in my esteem as my tastes have developed but I still grab one now and then. +++Pours a cloudy brown color (same color as the bottle in fact). No light shines through. Small tan head. The aroma is of grapefruit and molasses. The flavor is sharp and bitter with a strong grapefruit presence. This beer really slaps you in the face with hop presence. Some sweet maltiness comes along as the beer warms up a bit, but overall this is a really unbalanced beer. The hops really overwhelm any other flavor present.

Aroma is incredible. It almost made my eyes water. Hoppy to the max with some citrusy notes present as well. Taste is a well balanced hops/citrus/malt mixture that leaves an interesting sweet and sour bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. This stuff hits the nail right on the head. Aggressive indeed!","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"

Initial aroma of a freshly opened sour grapefruit slapped me in the face.  Alcohol and a full richness lingered in the nose of this noble beast.  As I put my lips up to the glass the beer bit my tongue. The grapefruit tartness runs throughout the beer as its strong backbone.  Carmel sweetness lingers in the background.  Spices and other unique flavor round this beverage out wonderfully.  Mouth feel is medium, and the aftertaste might be the most impressive thing of all.

RERATE: Dark color reddish brown color. Delicate ring of tight white creamy bubbles.  Aroma is bitter hops.  Dark, resiny. Also as the beer warms up, the malt starts to show up.  The flavor is very bitter with an abundance of hops. Fresh, rough, Arrogant.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","shadey"

2687,"2004-04-30",3.7,"Bottle.

Garnet colored with a great big, fluffy tan head that has solid staying power and drapes the glass is brussels lace galore.

The nose is full of malt, hops, brown sugar, pepper and toffee.  I was hoping for more fresh hop nose from the opinions Id gotten from others.  Maybe my bottle isnt quite as fresh as some.

The flavor is big.  Hop bitterness forward, with an acidic wang on the tip of the tongue.  Then malt comes pouring forth in a tidal wave of molasses, toffe, caramel, cinnamon, and brown sugar.  Crystal malt in quantity it seems, always with a vegetal, acidic hop presence.  I guess Id say this beer is 60/40 hop vs malt split with both sides of the equation off the scale!

Finish is tannic/acidic with a crisp hop bite to top it off.

2687,"2004-04-27",3.5,"OK, no real milestone for a 650th beer but still good to be able to try one of these bastards. In Australia there is an order of the old bastard which requires every member to greet one another as one, or buy a shout. No one is arrogant here, just bastards. Anyway this bastard decided to wait until the very last beer of the night to present his credentials. Arrogant indeed given that this was the 23rd of the night. Lucky he isn't a subtle bastard as we would have thought the finesse had been bastardised by numbers 1 to 22. Looks fabulous in the glass and so it scores very well for that. It has a pine needle type of hop resin nose with a hint of caramel. The taste is quite an experience, yep sure is bitter but for my palate seems to be a little unbalanced. Slighty OTT, as is expected of one so sure of himself.","Potts Point, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA","Sully"

It pours a deep red color with an off white head of medium size.  Head dissipated too quickly, and seems to leave little lacing.  Pfeh, who cares, let's get to the good stuff.  Aroma is pretty hoppy but strong alcohol and sweet crystal malts.  Taste is much the same!  The malt complexity is pretty impressive and hits right away, but with plenty of hop bitterness to keep things in line.  Mouthfeel may be a touch too carbonated, but the effervensance does serve to move the flavor around quite a bit.  Finishes dry and clean with a good alcohol taste and burn lingering.

To me it was very bitter and all of the hops overpowered some of the other less prevalent sweet flavors.  The mouthfeel wasnt anything special, but it was fine.  This wouldnt be my first choice for this style of beer.  Although drinkable, I wouldnt drink much of this at one time.

The hops in this one were subdued allowing the malty richness to come to the front. It still poured a deep clear chestnut brown with deep red highlights. Thick head that laced the glass with each sip. Rich complex aromas and a smooth, rich flavor that rememinded me of a better Barleywine.

I cannot stress this enough. First sip: Initial thought ""So, this is what badly fermented orange juice tastes like."" Second sip: Ok, a little more mellow.  OK, burnt orange taste, VERY bitter acrid aftertaste. 3rd sip: Am I rating something that is an overall 4.03? Did the fine folks at SBC accidently bottle dishwater in the bottle? 4th sip: Ok, the aftertatse from the first 3 sips is killing me. I wonder how many people buy this shit more than once? 5th sip: No more. As I finished this beer, it got a little better, but was still not plesant. Everything about this beer is overproduced. It is too sweet, too hopy, too freakn fruity. This is officaly the most overrated beer on this website. Period. A valuable lesson can be learned from this beer: a cute name does not a good beer make. If Budweiser released this very same beer with a name like ""Bud Strong Ale"" then most people would rate it around a 0.8 and complain about it. But, a micro with a cute name=masterpiece. Once again,a cute name does not make for a good beer.

Tastes extremely malty, with the aforementioned aromas as flavors.  This beer is dense and slightly thick on the palate (which is good).  Finishes smooth, malty, and hoppy, with a final burst of sweetish malt, slight hops, and fine cognac/scotch.  As the label says, ""You are not worthy"".

I can't imagine many (normal)people getting on with this, but we lot are a bit different!  Aggressive and arrogant are not the words.  The aroma is so very very tart.  I noted passion fruit and grapefruit.  The colour is a dirty brown, but we shouldn't pay too much credence to that.  This beer tastes at first like grapefruit in need of sugar (lots), but you soon start to enjoy the tartness of it.  It is hard going as a first experience of this type of beer and I probably cannot do it justice with my English palate.  Certainly a sipping type beer rather than guzzling; but a beer that when you finish it, it is with pleasure rather than pain - well worth drinking.","Wootton, Northampton, Northamptonshire, ENGLAND","maeib"

Aroma is on the sweetish side with flowery hops and malts that smell like honey. I can also detect a fair bit of grain on the nose with hints on vanilla and oak. Malt profile is very Scottish with sweet caramel, plum, cherry, vanilla, and a bit of smoked grain. Hops are quite detectable, and become more pronounced as the beer warms some. The hops add some dryness to the aftertaste due to their spicy, woody character, but they are not really bitter. As the beer gets warmer still, the malts that had been subdued by the hops make a big comeback with very fruity esters. Silky smooth mouthfeel with a nicely warming alcohol content. A sipping beer to wind down a stressful day at work, as the experience is totally relaxing and mellow.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Despite being apparently different styles, the entire time I drank this I was comparing it to Alpha King. Three Floyds and Stone I see as two premiere microbreweries in high demand. AB and AK are the two flagship brews so I subconciously was measuring the two against each other.

The taste is not nearly as bold as I was expecting.  I'm not normally a hop-head, but this is hops well done.  Some sweetness and citrus up front, but the hops really dominate the flavor.  The citrus, grapefruity twang really helps to balance the bitterness and keep it in line.  It packs a bitter aftertaste, but not overwhelmingly so.

The mouthfeel is very smooth and pleasantly bubbly.

I get lots of citrus again, but with more orange, and this blends seamlessly with the sweet maltiness to make a coherent, billet-like chunk of apricot-infused goodness.

2687,"2003-09-17",4.4,"A rich, assertive but nicely balanced West Coast ale with a quite complex aroma and flavor.  Poured with a beige med-sized rocky head that's fairly long lasting; good lacing.  Deep amber color with coppery red highlights.  Slight chill haze typical of bottle conditioned beers; cleared as the beer warmed.  Perfumy floral hop bouquet with underlying citrus-grapefruit notes.  Sweet caramel malt nose with a myriad of fruity esters that I was a bit hard pressed to put my finger on; perhaps raisin and plum with a bit of pear?  Noticeable alcohol aroma that became more evident as the glass warmed.  Flavor starts with a rich malt sweetness and bold hop bitterness that follows through to the finish.  Fruity esters emerge mid-palate with a subtle toasty note.  Malt richness dries a bit towards the finish but the hop bitterness remains assertive.  Palate has a velvety firmness enhanced by a soft carboantion.  Very slight astringency in the aftertaste.  For all its bold arrogance this brew actually mellows a bit (relatively speaking) as the glass warms making it a nice ale to enjoy at a leisurely pace.","San Francisco, California, USA","Flipbrewer"

I am starting to suspect that Stones bottles do not travel well to the East coast all the time.  This was my second disappointing experience with Stone.  
Pours a deep reddish mahogany, with some slight beige/white mildly creamy head.  Again, no sediment whatsoever.  Aroma is sharp and smells overly bitter and citrusy.
Opens up with a muted malt taste. In the middle of the beer, all of a sudden there is a bitter twang of hops flavor. Earthy yet piney, like a musty pinecone lying in the dirt. The malt is most curious in that it is not terribly sweet, but more dry and salty.  Texture is very similar to ruination ipa, velvety.  Beer certainly dosent thin out and has a nice full body, but the flavors are strange to say the least.  Slight astringency problems arise.  Has a muted honey herb flavor as it finishes and there is still bittersweetness on the palette.  I really wish I could try this on tap. I would imagine it to be much better.  Definitely want to try again.  Rerate.  Bottle again.  Opened up bitter, muddled and syrupy BUT as it warmed and breathed, I finally saw some goodness in this beer.  Flavor of a double IPA comes out, moderate caramel malt, chewy, almost leafy-like texture, fuzzy, peppery.  Big bitter flavor and too much acid on the finish, but the nice hop flavor is apparent.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Smell is of hops, but not overpoweringly so; really a subdued surprise here. Taste is a combination of both floral and fruity hops. Most pronounced are the apricot and pineapple flavors that are also found in the regular stone IPA. The major differences of this beer are a darker color and a bigger bitter, more varied taste. There are indeed “aggressive” hops added to the mix that give a really nice bite. The aftertaste is more bitter hops and fruity sweetness; both well disguise any alcohol that may have been lurking.

2687,"2003-07-25",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 2, 2003 OK, the first time I had this beer was a few months ago on a very hot and humid east coast day. I poured it in a pint glass and sipped on it while cleaning and getting ready to move out of my apartment. I remember thinking, ""Wow! This is agressive!"" It took me about an hour to finish the pint, and by the end my palate was destroyed. Well, I tried ""the bastard"" again yesterday and it was a milder, yet more complex experience, and totally enjoyable. The aroma jumps out at you as soon as the cap is popped. It smells like canned peaches and pine needles. Pours a beautiful dark, ruby red. Tastes like piney hops, bitterness surrounds the entire toungue. To quote a friend, ""it's like a freakin' orchard."" One more thing...whatever beer you drink right after you have an arrogant will taste like an arrogant. that taste is burned into your taste buds. Crazy stuff. Agressive. AMAZING.","Redondo Beach, California, USA","drinkbeer"
2687,"2003-07-24",4.1,"Just because this beer has a devil on the bottle doesn't mean it's a spawn of Satan. Oh no, this beer is all about the sweet, tenderness that your mother coddled you with as a child.  The warm caress of a lover as you picnic next to a sunny , bubbling brook.  The rich smell of a field of poppies blooming under the hot vision of the sun.  In fact, this beer pours snuggle bunnies that hop, hop hop around in chocolate, coffee, caramel and raisons.  That hop, hop, hop until they get put under the blade and stuffed in the oven.  Yeah - that's your little bunny cooking in the oven now!  And you're going to eat it and enjoy it or else the gargoyles will fly down and grab you and take you away to the dark place!  Now drink the damn beer!","San Francisco, California, USA","MrDick"

The aroma is quite malty, caramel, and lots of citrus hoppiness. The flavor is complementary to the aroma, sweet caramel and tons of hops. Medium-full body with a big malty finish, still lots of bitterness on the tongue though! While I still like this beer I am not quite as enamoured with it as I once was. Its actually somewhat simple and has a fairly astringent aftertaste. I am thinking that my bottle was not so fresh and this is the culprit. 7/23/2003 8/4/9/4/18 - 4.3 I have had this both on tap and out of the bottle. Both delivery methods were very similar (a good sign). Massive hops aroma, not flowery (no Cascades here). Nice head with good lacing. Tastes bitter but ha/s a very thick malty mouth-feel to balance out the bitterness. Quite simialr to its big brother Double Bastard just a wee bit toned down comparatively (to Double Bastard definitely not compared to other brews).","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"

2687,"2003-07-19",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 17, 2004 Okay, so I just need to start by saying that this is my 100th rating  Im so excited, here comes the little crown by my user name and a whole new level of respect (I think!?!)  Although I didnt specifically plan it this way until just about a week ago, the Arrogant Bastard gets to cross this esteemed threshold with me.  And that seems fitting somehow.  It was this aggressive muther of a beer that lured me back to the dark side 3 years ago and inspired me to recommit to drinking good quality brews rather than those mass produced light posers that Id settled with for a few years.  So I do hold a fond spot in my heart for this liquid arrogance.  Its also fitting that this is a beer from Stone, a San Diego brewery  and if you notice, my user name is SD bru boy!  Local boy, local brew.  Okay, enough exposition, on to the rating.  This ale pours thick and dark  almost opaque, but caramel-red if you hold it up to a bright light.  It gives rise to a massive light brown head, which takes its own good time to dissipate.  The head also leaves beautiful lacing from the top to the bottom of the glass.  The aroma, ahhhh heavenly (in my version of heaven anyway), rich roasted malts, spices, caramel, dried apricots, citrus, light roasted coffee and abundant floral hops (but not those pretty, dainty little flower kind of floral hops, these are the bold, assertive kind of flower, floral hops that reach out and smack you in the nose overly zealous, huge, flesh eating and redolent  those kind of flower, floral hops).  The flavor is big, really big and scary.  Its the kind of flavor that the entirety of the Anheuser-Busch Corp. cringes and runs away from like a little schoolgirl confronted by a roaring, drooling, stalking tyrannosaur.  Its a flavor that assails the tongue with muscular  yet oddly graceful  sweet roasted malts, ripe berries, subtle alcohol and fruitiness balanced by the most amazing blast of hops ever to lay waste to a patch of taste buds.  The body is thick  charging the border toward syrupy, but then pulling back at the last minute to deliver a supple, creamy dose of carbonation.  It has a body to lust after (in mind, in heart and in palate).  So now Ill say it again, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh!  An amazing brew and one to which I owe a debt of gratitude.  Thank you Stone, thank you Arrogant Bastard, Im doing my best to prove myself worthy","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"

2687,"2003-07-15",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 23, 2003 22 oz bottle served in tulip glass.  Off-white head diminishes quickly.  Red-brown color on the table; plum when held to a light.  Strong grapefruit and resin presence in the aroma.  Malt and yeast are in the back (molasses and dough?).  Body seemed a bit watery and lacked carbonation.  Bitterness throughout with a moderately acidic finish.  Similar to Rogue's Brutal Bitter, but not quite as chewy IMHO.  I would have given this one a much higher rating if the malt played a bigger role.

ORIGINAL RATING: Frothy, robust tan head that lingers moderately.  Dark amber color, almost burgundy with some opacity.  Scent of dark caramel and some fruity hints (citrus?  sure.  apples?  peach?  nectarine?  ok.).  Very nice lacing on the glass.  Initial taste is of bitter fruit, very creamy and full.  Goes down smooth as silk, leaving behind a tingly warmth on the tongue, mouth with a long-lasting buzz.  Strong hops presence, but not that floral-- mostly fruity and refreshingly bittersweet.  This stuff is not strongly alcoholic for a beer as robust and powerful as this, but something hit me very quickly-- I can't say I was drunk, but I was definitely feeling different after just one 22 oz. bottle.  Very tasty stuff, deservingly the flagship beer from Stone (although I'd prefer the Imperial Stout).  One of the best things about my recent move to California.  Can't wait to try this on draft! (Original score: 7/5/8/4/16/4.0)  RE-RATE: 11/14/03.  On draft at Stone Brewery in San Marcos, CA 11/14/03.  Dark amber brown-- very dark.  Nice fluffy dark cream head, disappears.  Quick and light lacing.  Nose is mostly malt with bright, light subtle sweetness.  Pleasantly smooth medium mouthfeel until the stinging hops, then a little bright sweetness on the edge.

It should not be served as cold as lagers and as Americans are used to having beers served.  At that temperature, it's is incredibly hoppy, perhaps overpoweringly so.  Yet, as the beer warms, it sweetens in your mouth, filling your tongue with many flavors, both sweet and bitter at the same time.

A very attractive and inviting beer with a dark ruby color and firm creamy head with heavy lacing.  Reminiscent of Bigfoot ale:  strong caramel malt backbone topped by a ton of hops - just a different kind of hop than Bigfoot.  Very piney and resiny.  Malts are present, providing a syrupy body with some caramel and toffee presence, but the hops effectively mask most malt taste.  A quinine type bitterness, hop flavors are tingly in the mouth, mixing with the syrupy feel in an almost unpleasant way.   Maybe Im not worthy, but I dont believe this beer is particularly great.
Rerate: not sure what was wrong the last time I had this, but this bomber (purcahsed at my local gas station here in FL, rockin!) was a fairly decent, somewhat balanced dark hoppy ale. The malts were mildly chewy, caramelized and sweet. The hops were resiny with a slight citric character. Not overly bitter.

2687,"2003-05-31",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 14, 2005 Original rating: Bronze body and an interesting aroma of rich crystal malts, strong, enigmatic Stone-style hops, and honeydew. Flavor is fairly hoppy but has a big fat brown sugar and cinnamon malty middle from the obnoxious malts. Full, chewy palate that becomes cloying. Every time I sample this beer, I find myself dissappointed. The thick malt qualities remind me of a double Fat Tire. Considerably less nuanced than advertised. Im a huge Stone fan, but not so much when it comes to this beer. I guess Im ""not worthy"". Stone IPA is a champion and clearly superior to this brew. Ditto for Double Bastard. For some reason I still keep coming back to the Arrogant Bastard though. 8,4,6,3,15.
Re-rate from a fresh draught pint: This is a completely different beer. Big fat fruit notes and nice, fresh hop sting balance the chewy malts wonderfully.

It wasn't so much I was worried the ale would be too strong for me as that I just plain wouldn't like it.

The beer pours to a rich dark amber color with a foamy beige head which leaves a fair amount of lacing. The smell is intensely astringent and citrusy. The taste was reminicent of unsweetened grapefruit juice with a light overtone of crisp hop bitterness.

RARELY does a beer come along that is new and original.  Something that hasnt been done yet.  This is an aggresive beer, not for pansies.  Hoppy and bitter, alcoholic and deep. Color is somewhat amber and non flattering,  hiding the truth of the beer.  Head holds its own.  Buy this beer.","Los Angeles, California, USA","WestsideThreat"
2687,"2003-05-10",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2004 I've had this a lot.  One time it resulted in me locking myself in the laundry room.  Right now it tastes excellent.  Sometimes the first one is a bit of a shock.  But the next always tastes like nectar.  Reddish brown with beautiful lace.  Just a little chocolatey with a medium bitter finish.  Stone has to be one of the best breweries in the country.  Rerate Oak Aged:  Very spicy compared to regular.  Kind of has a pumpkin pie taste to me.  More complex than the original.  Also had Oak Aged on cask once.  It was a little softer than the regular Oak Aged.  Overall, Arrogant Bastard is one of the most consistantly satisfying beers out there.  Great price too.","Fallbrook, California, USA","Kasteelfreak"

I have been known to put stamps on envelopes upside down. I have even worn my underwear two days in a row. But putting my mouth to THAT! And DRINKING it! Now, that's going a bit too far. This is all Krisbierjaeger's fault. Now, there's an arrogant bastard for you. He sends me a bottle of this stuff and expects me not only to drink it, but to be somehow grateful? Grateful! Ha! I am clearly not worthy of being grateful. So, let go of my ears and let me breathe some clean air, the spicy fumes are just too much. I mean, this stuff smells like.... well, it's way too fruity for me. I'll just have a glass of low fat milk, if it's all the same to you. Or a nice cup of camomile tea. I mean, there's chocolate and licorice in that... Devilish flavours. Tempting flavours... Quite nice flavours... Well, maybe one little sip - after all, it does look rather fetching there in the glass. Sort of like a dirty raspberry colour. A rather naughty little raspberry that's been rubbing against a buffaloe's arse. I swear it just winked at me! O yes, that's good! Spank me! Spank me! Pull me down and let me nestle my nose in the bosom of your lupine delights. Tickle me with the hairs of your mighty orifice. Teach me how to drink in the glory of all that is life! Let me gulp down great draughts of marmite and the belching aroma of warthogs fed on the meaty droplets of behelzebub's farts. Let me... just stop a moment. Mmmm. This stuff tickles. It's arrogant, and it's laughing at me. Is it mocking my helpless indulgence in its sheer beauty? Or it is rejoicing in its own confidence? In its life affirming assurance? In its ability to open my eyes to a whole new world of assertive affirmation? Wow! I feel like a new man. Is this really my house? Is this really my wife? Is that really the tie I am wearing?

I think they tried too hard with the hops. There are other flavors there that are trying to get through to your taste buds, but can't because the bitterness is just too overpowering.

First things first, this is a Big Beer: Big Taste, Big Aroma, Big Hops, Big Deep Blood-Red Color. The scent hits you the moment you crack the bottle open- fruity, hoppy, INSANELY strong. Pours with a nice brown-tan head that quickly diminishes into a little top-fizz. Tastes about how it smells, monstrously hoppy with a strong bite and aftertaste that keeps going for ages. To be honest, I'm worthy enough to like this for the great, ultra-strong beer that it is, but I'm not worthy enough to fully appreciate everything that there is about this beer.

Kids playing in the back gardens, the first tiny green leaves on trees and coming out of the ground, announcing the flowers that will soon arise. The first little bugs crawling over the finally dry floor of my garden. Birds getting excited about the bugs and making love. Then the sound of a beerbottle being opened - pssshh. It pours a beautiful red-brown color with a light brown head leaving very nice lace. Smelling the beer gave me a feeling even beyond the extasy I already felt. A very very beautiful hop perfume with some caramel and raisin. This beer must be yummy! The first sip was so much in contrast with all surrounding me. A very harsh hoppy flavor but yet light sweet. A nice fruitiness, raisin, plum and hell I don't know what - complex. A nice body, full and filling my stomache but not like liquid bread. A medium long lasting finish with much bitterness that almost makes it acidic. You can imagine I had much trouble rating this beer objectively.

The alcohol manages to be filling without being overpowering and can't be tasted. It's a tad on the (over)pricey side and difficult to acquire outside CA.

After a couple disappointments with Stone beers, Id started to wonder if the brewery wasnt overhyped.
Im happy to report that Arrogant Bastard Ale lives up to any hype it has received.
This is real beer!
Attractive beer, perfect frothy head, fine bubbles, deep red/brown color.  Slight haziness is a bit offputting.
Complex, pleasing aroma; malty, hoppy, and strong bread/french toast as the beer warms.
Even more complex and pleasant palate; perfect full,creamy mouthfeel, sweet (peachy), appropriately bitter, with a strong peppery note. 
Also the same french toast as in the nose.
In summary, an unforgettable, highly unique beer.

2687,"2003-01-04",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2003 An exceptional dark amber ale fully of character and a striking amount of hops.  This is an aggressive beer says the label, and I""ll vouch that it doesn""t lie.  I had this beer on tap several weeks back and really enjoyed it but found that it was surprinsingly close to Mac & Jacks African Amber Ale.  Being able to sit back and relax with a bottle in hand and the time and place to actually take some better notes to review it, I""m guessing my notes were wrong, or I was poured the wrong beer.  (As such, I""ve resubmitted my review for this beer).

From the bottle, Arrogant Bastard doesn""t look, smell or taste like Mac & Jacks, it""s far superior.  AB pours a deep reddish hue with a big white rocky head.  Glass lacing is extensive.

Aroma wise, this one carries a very enjoyable hoppy kick, hints of fruit, and complex malts.  It doesn""t carry the pine hit that the Ruination IPA offers, which helps to make this a much more rounded ale which can be savored in more than one serving per sitting.

On the palette, the hops and malts are creatively balanced, providing hints of fruit, toasted malts and a slight peppery smokiness to it.  Despite its edgy hoppiness, the malt factor kicks in to really make this an exceptionally well rounded ale that can be enjoyed again and again.  

Great balance worth a closer look for those who have yet to venture into the grip of the Arrogant Bastard.

(ADDENDUM: 12/27/02 I had the opportunity to visit a place called Fogg & Suds on the outskirts of Vancouver, BC the other day, and to my astonishment this place is trying to fetch $30.00cdn for a bottle of this stuff.

The color, a dark cherry was suprisingly murky, not as clear as I hoped.  Dark but not clear up to the light.  The first sip took me by suprise.  It was strong, rough and bitter.  Not my favorite.  But after the first sip or two the mellow under tones smoothened it out. I should have continued to simply drink this strong ale alone but I had it with dinner.  BIG MISTAKE.  I ate it with chicken and vegatables and it was almost undrinkable.  It made the food seem too sweet and the food made it seem too bitter.  Too bitter you say?  Is that possible?  YES.

Original Rating: This has a fresh citrusy hop aroma with hints of caramel malt.  Deep copper with a thick, lacy, cougar-colored head that coats the glass as it diminishes.  Starts slightly malty and sweet, almost chocolatey, finishes sort of sticky and astringently bitter, but remains pretty well balanced.  Another plus is that you really can't taste the ABV.  In my opinion, they used to many bittering hops, and not enough aroma or flavor hops.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

Original Rating: Hops! Mind expanding amounts of flavor. Maybe too much of some but I think that's the point. A real killer. It's not my favorite beer but Arrogant Bastard is a definite must try, if only for the name and the cool bottle. My favorite part: the grapefruit finish. Avoid drinking this too cold; it throws off the balance of flavors. At refrigerator temp, it's a fist of hops straight to your face. Wait for it to warm and it's much more well rounded.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

2687,"2002-11-21",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2003 It's been over a year since I originally rated this - 2 new observations:  1. I now notice a very sweet thick malt in the taste and palate.  2.  My best friend Gina wants to have the top 3rd cut off so that she can use the bottle as a vase for flowers - would that be sacreligious, twisted and bent? or would it be a great new industry to get into? - the Beer Bottle/Flower Vase Industry?
  


original rating: Extreme beer should be a new category for beers that challenge you.  The first time I tried this, I hated it. (maybe because I was on a porter kick, not prepared for this Bastard's hop content?).  So, every week at the beer store it kept taunting me from the shelf.  Fine. bought 2 more bottles. Damn it - this is one of my faves. I like the initial bite of the hops followed by the full mouthfeel, finally you have to swallow, crisp, warming finish, how can it be so balanced in the end when it tries to hop you to death at the begining.  THis is not for beginners - you need a full appreciation of the beer tasting spectrum before you are truly 'worthy' of this beer.  I've actually warned a couple of friends away from this - when they are ready, I will buy them one and maybe walk them thru the experience like a shaman......can't say anymore about it.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"

Flavor is excellent, really over the top on both the hops and the malt.  If I hadnt had a 3Fs Dreadnaught a couple of months ago, I would probably think this was ""the shit"" in the Am Strong category; as it is, it does most things right, though there is a weird heavy molasses-like quality to the body in the middle that Im not crazy about.

2687,"2002-11-07",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2004 This beer rocks.
What was I thinking with my previous rating? I rated it fairly high, but was way off with my description... I think. I described the appearance as a cloudy mohogany color. Ummmm, the beer I am currently staring at is as clear and sparkling as the Golden Dome in South Bend, Indiana. Mohogany isnt a bad description, but ruby is more accurate. The medium-sized head is off-white, creamy and mostly lasting. Excellent lacing too.
The aroma is left coast all the way. Malty, mysteriously spicey and very floral. A little buttery too.
The flavor is malty and bitter up front... leaning farther toward the left coasts hops than Londons toasted malts. Not balanced. Not supposed to be. Yeah, sure, there are notes of caramel and toffee on the tongue, but the hops beat the living shit out of them. Im glad that all dark ales arent this massively hopped, but I am rather enjoying this one. The perfect beer for a cold, rainy, November West Virginia night such as this.
This beer is full-bodied with lively carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel. Medium length, semi-dry, bitter finish. Notes of buttery toffee at the wee end of the finish. Great Beer! Have one.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2687,"2002-11-06",4.1,"Hops, of course. Also an earthy texture in the finish. If you pour it cold, drink it slowly and let it warm up (much like Stones Imperial Stout), the flavor becomes much more more complex as it warms.
I tasted this and immediately thought of SN Bigfoot, but then I hadnt had one in a while. It would be an interesting back to back taste test.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"

I read the label before I drank it so I was expecting something a little more harsh I guess but it turned out to be quite pleasant. This is a fine ale. The first time I tried this beer was the first time I ever saw Taxi Driver, the greatest film of all time. Whenever I drink this, it makes me want to watch the film, and when I watch the film, it makes me want to drink this. May 10th.

2687,"2002-10-09",4.2,"This cranks out tons of pine tar and flowers in the nose, kind of like you poured a bunch of it over a flower patch. Yet, its a good smell. I almost feel like Im in the brewery and a new batch is ready to go, a really fresh smell. The color of this beer is unlike any other. A deep magenta, almost on the edge of purple, rusty, orange brown, it is very clear , and very deep nonetheless. The head is a creamy beige microbubble soup that stays the course and laces up the sides. I dont usually base my ratings on the container, but I have to give this an extra appearance point for some of the best beer label literature around.  Yes, this is a big beer, but it balances like an elephant on the head of a pin, a move in any direction and it wouldnt work. Yet, it does. It starts of with a bit of black licorice sweetness and pine needles, the segues into a screaming hop finish, much like a meal of fresh flower petals. A classic and and one of a kind.

I mean, being able to be with a bunch of crappy beer drinking friends and saying to the bartender, Give me a pint of the bastard! and when your friends ask for a taste, they cringe at the intensity...how cool is that?  RE-RATE: How my taste has changed in about 6 months.  I gave this beer several more chances because I love everything else that Stone puts out and because its perfect to drink from my Arrogant Bastard pint glass.  I have definitely developed a taste for it.  The aftertaste still doesnt appeal much to me, but the flavor has a very strange and complex fruitiness - something that is hard to describe in terms of existing fruits, its as if it tastes like a fruit that God forgot to invent.  If I had to describe it, Id say lemons and grapefruit is about as close as one could get.  It seems to somehow make it into the malt profile and hoppiness.  Quite nice!  ORIGINAL RATING:  I find this stuff over-rated.  The flavor is okay but unremarkable (raisins, figs?) but the aftertaste kills anything else good about the beer.

2687,"2002-08-28",3.8,"<P>I really wish I could have liked this beer, not because of its marketing (which is pretty damn cool) but because it is a great beer in almost every aspect. It had a beautiful dark red hue that is unusual for a beer not flavored with a berry. There was a complete lack of head, but I may have been overly careful after an experience with a bottle of Guinness earlier in the weekend. The aroma was nicely hopped and hinted of a complex flavor. The flavor itself was complex and very Belgian-like with hints of fruitiness and other hard to identify flavors. The problem came in the overwhelming bittereness. It was just too strong and ended up overwhelming all of the other flavors in the beer. This however may change, (originally all beer tasted this way to me, and I may have still been recovering my taste for beer after a small hangover from late in the previous week) so I may have to come back and rerate this beer later.

<P>rerate 8-29-02: Its only been a few months since my original rating and already the overwhelming bitterness has changed to easily palateable bitterness. Nice creamy foam pitted head this time. Too dark to be called off-white. Body is reddish brown, nice but not exceptional. Aroma is some sweet malt and a slightly pine-liek hop bite. Flavor bites first, a little interesting maltiness in the middle and some fruitiness (I could have sworn it was peach there a couple of times, but it became more vague after that) It ends with a fairly short, bitter finish.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

2687,"2002-08-25",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 18, 2003 Nice hazy brown color with a thick tan head. The aroma and flavor of this beer are all over the place. At first, the aroma is very similar to a Stone IPA. Later, it becomes more sweet (sugary) and malty. The flavor evolved in a similar way with hints of alcohol towards the end. I'm still not sure where I stand on this beer, but I will say that I think the Double Bastard has a more direct, assertive character that best represents the idea of the Arrogant Bastard Ale. The Stone Brewery certainly has challenged the way I think about beer, and what my standards for a great beer are. Awesome!
Re-rate  I drink this brew about once a month or so, and I'm always struck by how tangy it is. I mean, it's sweet, tangy, bitter, and has a bunch of indescribable flavors in there as well. This is perhaps the most tangy beer I've ever had! AWESOME!!!","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"

2687,"2002-07-22",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 21, 2004 Nice blend of caramel, fruit and pine in the aroma.  Arrogant Bastard is a deep red color, with very fine carbonation.  More choice blending of hops and malt in the flavor.  Malt is almost sticky sweet, but the earthy hop flavors are right on top of it to make sure it doesn't run too far.  I like the hops that are in this beer, whatever they are.  I do have a preference for the piney, spicy hops over the citrusy or less complex ones.  Finish sees some tingle on the palate from the hoppiness, then both malt and hops mingle again.  Similar in profile to a Winter Warmer or English Strong style, but has a bit more bitterness than most of those.  Quite tasty.  My kind of thing.  Not yours, though.  ;)","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

This is just one of those beers that is so unique and difficult to categorize that it is always a pleasure to drink. Pours a deep dark reddish brown with a thin and foamy beige head. Thin lacing. Aroma is alternatingly floral, fruity (citrus mostly), and malty. Medium-bodied and tart, with flavors of citrus, caramel, malt and pine. Complex yet easy to drink, with a nice strong and bitter finish. I have grown to appreciate this beer after having it so many times. 02/21/02 (3.7):I have to admit I didn't like this one on the fist taste, but at ounce 5 or so it started to taste really good. Not sure if this is a beer you want to spend the whole night drinking though, as it is expensive and hard to keep up with. Perfect color and different from the norm, which always scores points with me.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

2687,"2002-01-17",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2004 Stone Oak Aged Arrogant Bastard - Cask @ Real Ale Fest
Oh my grannies bustle, this was my second most favorite at the Real Ale Fest, just a tad behind the Russian River OVL Stout, in fact I had several samplers of this to be sure I was able to judge its character lol.
A somewhat hazy brown, the head a tan crown that was creamy in texture, the lace a thick coating upon the glass, with the nose sweet with the aroma of malt and Oak, hints of alcohol and bubble gum, yummy is a good description. Start was ambrosial, thick with malt, the top moderate to full in its feel. Finish was moderate in its a acidity, the hops delightful, quite dry and a bit of a tummy warmer, one damn fine beer in this old dawgs book.


Re-Rate 01/16/02: Been a while sence I had this bad boy, and it is a beer that 99.9% of the beer drinkers will not like? But I believe if you 'Can't Run With The Big Dogs, Stay On The Porch'. Pours a deep dark ruby brown, large beige head and lots of lace. Nose is malt, some what toasted, hints of hops, the start is malt, the middle full, robust, the finish is hop bitter and dry. Very hearty, a 'Beer Lovers' beer, not meant for the Palate Challenged Lite Beer Drinkers'.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
2687,"2002-01-16",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 8, 2006 Bottle. If youre a hophead, this is the one. Its not over the top as some beers can be and tries to find some balance with the malt, but its the hops thatll keep you coming back. This is one of a few beers I miss while living in the UK.

Rich dark reddish brown/amber color with a big off-white head. Rich flavor and body. Caramel backing. Grapefruit and tar","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
2687,"2002-01-03",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 3, 2003 Re-rate bottled.
Known in the Middle-East as Bush Beer this is a soft little mild and unassuming beer... No. Let's be serious. Reddish ruby in colour with fine, firm head. Aggresive citrusy aroma. Short blast of reasonably soft, clean firm maltiness. Very bitter finish, and (ha!) there is this celery salt flavour. 
OK, you win... 
This IS a good beer. Much better than I first thought (and thanks for the beer).

Old rating:
Nut brown. Dry, big weird celery aroma, very bitter. A love/hate beer. Must probably taste it again to decide which it is for me, but that is easier said than done on this side of The Pond... 5/4/4/3/8","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"

2687,"2001-12-22",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 23, 2010 12/22/01: A complex but possibly overdone and overrated beer. I enjoyed it but found the burnt malt flavor and lack of balance in the finish (a lot of alcohol flavor in only a moderately strong ale) to be a little displeasing. To its credit, a complex hop presence and an interesting malt flavor, and it did get better as it warmed. Well above average but not world class. 3.8. 

9/23/10: Nearly a decade later, my palate has gained wisdom. I was correct that this brew is very aggressive, but wrong about its balance on the palate, which nears perfection. Burnt caramel malt dominates above dark berry fruit and banana, with hints of grassy barnyard adding complexity. The long finish is wonderfully hoppy and creamy, and mingles beautifully with the dark malt body...anything but overdone.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
2687,"2001-12-13",3.7,"I would love to taste this beer without the hops, just out of curiosity.  They seem so, well, harsh and distracting, from what is probably a nice blend of dark goodies.  Ill say one thing, though, this beer has one hell of a silky mouthfeel, creamy even.  I suppose the extra attitude of the hops is the point theyre making, a kind of rebellious war cry lest the warm dark heart of this brew lull you.  Anyway, thanks, Michael, for the gift!","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
