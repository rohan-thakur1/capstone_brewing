Maku on stoutmaisempi: paahdetta, lakritsia ja suklaata on enemmän, nyt sitrus on hieman taustalla. Havuakin löytyy jälleen. Suutuntuma on melko täyteläinen ja lähes öljyinen. Humalointi tuntuu hieman ja kuivattaa lopuksi, mutta enemmän mennään aromi- kuin katkeropuolella sen suhteen. Hyvä ja täyteläinen BIPA, jossa tuokusssa pääosassa on sitruksinen humalointi, jota säestää suklainen ja lakritsinen runko, kun taas maussa on juuri päin vastoin humaloinnin ollessa vain hyvin tukemassa runkoa.","FINLAND","fantti"

3986,"2014-04-02",4.7,"Poured from bottle: Dark brown with a nice creamy mocha brown head.
Aroma - Chocolate, piney hops, brown bread, dark fruit underneath, hint of nutmeg
Taste - The taste on this beer is awesome. Starts out with sweet dark fruit, brown sugar, caramel, chocolate, to brown bread and roasted malt, to coffee and bitter, piney, citrus hops, to dark burnt malt. 
Palate - medium body, fizzy carbonation, bready mouthfeel, long, satisfying bitter finish following an initial sweet chocolatey, fruity taste.

I poured this beer expecting a typical IBA with a bitter punch to the mouth. Instead I got more complexity and everything I love in a beer. Sweet fruit and chocolate, roasted malt, bitter hops, and a long, bitter finish.","","dbeatdano"

The aroma is dark chocolate, malt, earthy, and pine hops. The taste is bitter, dark chocolate, malty, and fruity hops The mouthfeel is lively and this beer is medium bodied. Wow! What a good beer! It is not overly hoppy tasting which is a good thing for this non-hop head! The flavors come together very, very well and this is a beer I could drink again and again and again.

3986,"2013-08-31",3.6,"A steady pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a three-finger thick, nice tan colored head that leaves some layered lacing patterns as I slowly work my way through this beer. The beer is a concentrated brown / amber hue that isnt really black; when held up to the light the beer shows a brilliantly clear, concentrated ruby hue. The aroma is dense with candied citrus fruit and tropical fruit hop notes; candied tangelo zest, lychee, sweet guava, Curacao orange, and a huge, floral, sort of peach like, but definitely tropical fruit laden character is noticeable up front. This is backed by some earthy roasted malt notes that provide a whole grain toasted character, and a touch of smooth, not quite burnt malt character.

Sweet hoppy fruit notes up front are balanced by bitter, pine leaning, and slightly herbal hop notes in the finish that mostly dry things out. Up front, flavors of lychee, peach concentrate, candied tangelo zest, and orange rock candies, some passion fruit notes and even some pineapple all play a prominent role. The middle and finish is a bit sharper with a bitterness mostly from the hop character, but also accentuated by a roast grain bitterness, some woody pine needle notes, some menthol, and a woody-herbal character that melds with the sharp roasted malt flavors. Touches of black coffee, some burnt grain huskiness, and just an all-around, fairly smooth roasted malt character lingers in the finish. Still the finish does not escape the ample hop fruit character that dominates the front half of each sip. This is nice and quaffable, the body has a certain viscosity to it, but is light enough to be what an IPA needs to be. At times the hop character brings out a sharpness and bite to the finish that is accentuated by some alcohol notes and can be sharp, though not quite characterizable as harsh.

Defintiely a nice beer for those looking for a hop fix with roasted overtones; this is nicely hop dominated, and the roast character does not get in the way if the bright hop fruit character.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Such a nice blend of flavors from a stout and an IPA: As it hits your tongue, you get a very sweet, sugary start. In the middle, youre hit with the stout part - dark roasted malt, coffee notes, maybe even a small hint of licorice. The aftertaste is dominated by the hops. Even though I dont think this is the freshest bottle, the hops are very dominant - very, very nice! Extremely good beer! A small hint of the 8.5 % ABV as it warms up. Mouthfeel is a little bit bigger than medium and dry, surprise. Again, super nice blend of the two styles - not too thin, not too big. And the aftertaste of dark, bitter hops just lingers forever 5.

Creamy texture, medium carbonation, medium to full body and a bitter finish. Flavour has a heavy malty profile, which is however offset nicely by hoppy bitterness.

Moderate to light sweet initial taste, followed by a fantastic long and lingering heavy bitter hoppy fruity finish accompanied by roasted notes and coffee. Prominent but pleasant vinous alcohol notes. Some faint liquorice as well. Deeper into the bottle I think that the fresh hop notes start to become even more evident.

If youve ever had coffee ice cream (a Rhode Island thing I know) you with recognize the cloying aftertaste. Obviously heavy body, though the hop content pushes it right along.

3986,"2011-11-09",3.9,"My Bottom Line :  
This complex brew sports a complex array of aromas and flavors amongst which bloom raisins, roasted cereals, chocolate, caramel, molasses and bitter, resinous hops. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A veil of foam skirts the brown-hued blackness.
-The malt profile shares lineage with the great Hill Farmstead Everett and Olfabrikken Porter.
-Drinkability is relatively high even though the flavors are rather intense.
-The resinous hop bitterness becomes drying after a while.
-The quiet carbonation lets the flavors dominate the mouthfeel.

The nose was chocolate, and citrus hops.  The flavor was both of those, too.  Early, the hops lead and they tasted citrus.  That was a bit of a challenge as the chocolate tended to take out those nuances.  Later, chocolate took charge and this became a hoppy stout.  Alcohol was tasted and was the only detriment here.  This was very tasty and smooth.  Often this style is an IPA that is dark or has a bit of roasted notes.  Not this one.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a very dark brown that was opaque black in the glass with a large, light brown head that stuck around for a long while and left good lacing. The aroma was very nice, but a little weaker than I expected. There was moderate to heavy dark chocolate and roasted malts; medium to heavy pine hops and lighter citrus hops; slight cherry and slight licorice. The initial flavor was moderate to heavily sweet and moderately bitter; while the finish was moderately sweet, heavily bitter, lightly salty and lightly sour. There was chocolate, pine hops, dark chocolate, cream, slight vanilla, chocolate syrup, very rich chocolate mousse, licorice, chocolate ice-cream and a little citrus hops.

Mouth is fairly lightweight yet full, somewhat creamy, lightly carbonated with a wet finish.  Flavor is lightly sweet, chocolate, molasses, toasted malt, caramel, toffee, and a long hop finish mixed with said dark malts that boasts a strong grapefruit rind splash leading the charge.  Not really my style.  Great malt profile for a stout or Istout, but needs to age significantly (1-2yrs+) to be suitable there.  As far as black IPAs go, its my second, and second favorite.  Smells great.  Flavor is harsh, almost astringent, as the hops cut through the dark malts...and those malts are so heavy and thick...its just not my thing in this case.  Even cutting the malts back would help so the hops could take more of a front seat instead of fighting in the back...not a huge fan with it in this state.

3986,"2011-01-14",4.4,"27-Sep-10 (500-ml bottle: Purchased 31-Dec-09 for $7.49 at www.wineandcheeseplace.com)  The Black IPA style is still in its infancy, but Black Hops is one of the finest example of this style Ive ever tried.  What separates this beer from most others in the style is that despite loads of dark-roasted malt and hops, the bitterness level is moderate; most examples combine strong, roasty bitterness with astringent hop bitterness for a beer that bludgeons the palate.  Aromas of dark chocolate cake, licorice, earth, decaying logs, molasses, and pine needles lead into flavors of pure cacao, coffee, molasses, burnt toast, earth and prunes, with finishing flavors of smoke and ashtray.  Piney hops manage to balance the malt-driven flavors perfectly, lending medium-high bitterness.  Softly carbonated, full bodied, slightly viscous, and fairly sweet on the palate, yet dry in the finish.  Black in color and fully opaque, the beer sports a full inch of creamy, light-brown head that settles slowly to a thin layer while leaving patches of lace on the glass.  Black sludge coats the bottom of the bottle.  Just an excellent beer.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

The body is full and creamy, with average carbonation, and a long resin hops with molasses and coffee finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"

The aroma is dank resiny piney hops in a sandwich of dark chocolate. leather baseball glove, smoked  ham meat and wrapped in cavendish tobacco leaves. Yes, I just had a boner and it was good!  The taste is lush sweet chocolate and charred black malts fighting for play with the dank and fruity hops yet in the end peace is achieved and harmony is found all over my palate. Me so f**king happy right now. Cygnus the God of Balance would be proud and proclaim this an otherworldly experiance! This brew has layers of earthy goodness that simply rocks it out. Hoppy enough not to be a Imperial Porter or Stout, it is very much akin to fresh Alpha Klaus but with more body and bitterness. Best of all is that while some ashy and chalky character is found on the palate, this brew is oh so drinkable and oh so smooth. Damn dangerous this is. I have had more than a few Black IPAs and this sets a benchmark for the new and expanding genre. Beer Here Please!

3986,"2010-10-13",3.8,"From notes - fresh 500ml bottle consumed soon after U.S. import.  Pours nearly black at first glance, showing truer hues of dark mahogany upon closer inspection.  Theres a slight translucency at the edges.  A moderate head of smooth, whipped, light brown foam gives skinny snakes and small spots of lacing.  Bold, resinous, piny hops leap from the glass, leading the aromatic charge, followed by bits of earth and dry roast.  Beneath, notes of cocoa powder and dried caramel comprise the malt base.  Flavors follow suit, replicating the Cascadian style of the Pacific Northwest very closely.  Rich, bittersweet cocoa roast is met with just a little burnt caramel sweetness, as the sharp, resinous pine hops add ample bitter character.  Toasty bread and some dried molasses also come through.  The palate is slightly more substantive than medium bodied, and the carbonation is moderate and primarily dry.  Biting pine hop resins grip the tongue well after the finish.  Overall, a very fine example of the hoppy stout/black IPA category.  Right up there with the best examples that Ive had.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

The same holds true for the flavor, with rich chocolate, roasted malts, peat, earth, burnt toast, yeast, and brown sugar.  The body is medium- if it were a little fuller this would resemble an imperial stout even more closely- with low carbonation.  Dank, peaty mouthfeel.  Reminds me a lot of a foreign stout in a lot of ways; upon smelling, I knew right away this was from Northern Europe somewhere and it absolutely reminded me of a few Nogne O brews Ive had.

This is a pretty interesting beer.  You can definitely taste the roasted/chocolate malts, but the hops are the stronger aspect of this one.

3986,"2010-05-28",3.7,"2/10/2010:  Beer Here Dark Hops Hoppy Black Ale...  Aroma:  Over-ripe citrus hoppiness; just a tinge of chocolate.  Appearance:  As dark or darker than most Imperial Stouts; two finger (or more) head of lasting tan-colored foam.  Flavor:  Dark to bittersweet chocolate and coffee malt, roasty followed by an extremely dry and citrus-like hoppy bitterness; very pleasing mocha flavor left on the palate.  Palate:  Medium-full, smooth.  Overall:  Wow, based on the name I was really expecting a ""Black IPA"" but this was something altogether different and maybe even better!  It packs both maltiness and a more than generous hop presence and bitter.  The dryness is a bit off-putting at first, but the rich, chocolate/coffee flavor that follows more than makes up for it.  Wow, this beer is definitely unique and unlike anything you might be expecting.

3986,"2010-05-26",3.9,"Appearance: Pours a lush dark brown to black with a massive brown crown that displays lots of retention and uber lacing.

Smell: Rye, dark roast malt, resiny hops, dark chocolate, and a slight citrus almond tinge. The resiny hops are my favorite part.

Taste: Malt is roasted much more than the nose led me to believe. It almost has a hint of smoke or char. Also getting fig notes, toffee, and butterscotch. Hops arent as dominant as they were in the nose. A small alcohol tinge is present.

Mouthfeel: Fairly thick but creamy!

Drinkability: This is a pretty hefty brew with a decent abv but it is real tasty!

3986,"2010-04-07",3.3,"In short: An intense Black IPA/Mega-hoppy Stout.  Bold roasted maltiness and brutal bitterness.  Good in small servings.
How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed fresh a few weeks after purchase
The look: Near black body topped by a medium tan head
In long: The nose is intensely hoppy.  In a blind test I might have guessed IPA/IIPA.  The aroma is a ton of orangey hops with roasted malts underneath.  Taste brings the malts more upfront.  Molasses and burnt malts are the dominant flavors.  milk chocolate, some dark fruits, citrus fruits.  Body is creamy.  A truckload of hops with a signature that is halfway between fresh oranges and fresh green hops.  Very sharp bitterness.  The beer is very tasty, very very tasty, this is as intense as it gets for the style.  But it just feels like a bunch of stuff thrown at me just for the sake of being very tasty.  It took me over 30 minutes to drink a 500ml bottle, unusual for me.  I suspect the current high score on this one comes from a lot of tasting session ratings because this beer is really not something that can be enjoyed by the pints.  Is it well balanced?

I just recently heard about a beer thats a combination of my two favorite styles of beer. Imperial stout, and IPA. And i knew i had to try it. Dark Hops by Beer Here is that beer.

Poured into a tulip glass. Black with no light showing at all. One finger of a roasted hazelnut color head with tremendous lacing that hugs the glass for dear life.

Smell is very hoppy. Mostly citrus hops. Chocolate and roasted malts with some caramel and coffee also.

Well can literally taste this beer change flavors in your mouth. First you get hit with the citrus hop bite and slowly it warms as you swallow and turns to a roasted chocolate flavor and finishes tasting big time of coffee.

Mouthfeel is rich and medium to full bodied. Finishes super creamy with a tremendous after taste.

This is a hell of a beer! Best of both worlds. Hops, coffee, chocolate, alcohol. What more could you want. This beer is really a good time. Im glad i found this. I recommend you going out and getting one if you can find it.","Pennsylvania, USA","BigMike"

3986,"2010-01-10",4.0,"Jet black with a big brown and creamy head with very good retention. Nice lacings. A fine looking brew.

The smell has pleasant fresh hop aromas up front. Floral notes, hop resins, some citric notes. Faint spices. The hops blend nicely with a roasted malty backbone with nice coffee and chocolate aromas. A very good and fascinating smell.

The hops are up front in the mouth as well, and they are quite aggressive. Very fresh hop flavors, floral notes, resins and perhaps some grapefruit. However, the hops are not as powerful as in the smell, nor as complex. Nice foundation of roasted malts, big coffee flavors, chocolate. Perhaps some spices, faint vanilla and licorice. The finish is rather bitter with pleasant flavors of roasted malts, pine-needles, hop resins and wood. All in all, a very nice taste with a beautiful mix of fresh hops and the ""usual"" stout flavors of coffee and chocolate.

M: Medium body going towards full. Quite alot of carbonation actually that slightly bothers me. But other than that, this is a really good beer.

A little chocolate and hop resin are present behind all that roast.  Bitterness abounds throughout each sip, but isnt overblown. Mouthfeel is medium, with an oily texture and lively carbonation.

These two aromas really work together, melding nicely and fresh smelling. Taste is the roast up front with the pine and straw taking the middle and finish. Taste is really quite simple, just the two flavors, but as with the nose nicely melded. Palate is bright active carbonation with a medium to light mouthfeel and a clean bitter finish.

3986,"2009-11-16",3.9,"500mL bottle.

Pours a seriously dark brown out of the bottle and is an opaque black in the glass with a massive dark tan, creamy head that shows great retention and lacing.  A fantastic looking beer.

The aroma is interesting as the first thing I notice is the green herbal hops with hints of citrus.  But there is also a big roasted dark malt presence with dark chocolate as well.  Two big and bold aromas competing for supremacy.

The taste starts with a huge herbal, almost spicy, green hop kick - extremely bitter on the tongue from start to finish.  behind the bitterness is the dark roasted malts, which take on an almost charred character in the finish with the hops bringing an astringent bitterness at the same time.  Whoa.

The mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied but feels a little lighter than that at times due to the massive herbal hop profile which keeps the malts from settling in.  Lots of carbonation as well, maybe a little too much, but thats being picky.

I wouldnt call this one extremely drinkable but its still fun to drink with all the competing flavors popping on the palate at once.  Very creative and quite tasty.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

3986,"2009-11-03",4.1,"Excellent pour with a black body and a massive, creamy, dense, dark tan head which settles in time to a creamy, frothy layer and leaves plenty of frothy lace rings; must be the Grimstad water from Nogne that produces these perfect heads.  Nose is very pleasant with lots of pine, orange zest, light grapefruit, plenty of dark chocolate, burnt toast, roasted walnuts, toasted molasses, and some restrained coffee roast.  Flavor is nice but a bit of a letdown with lots of bakers chocolate, burnt toast, pine needles, light earthy rustic, cocoa, and light orange zest.  Palate is very silky smooth, nearly lively, medium to full, but fairly short flavor progression.  Finish is fairly short but nice with faint orange zest, rustic and pine, bakers chocolate, and light burnt toast.  At first, I thought this would be a black IPA hybrid, but actually the moderate bitterness portrays more of an Imperial Porter with plenty of finishing hops.  I wish there were just a bit more sweetness in the flavor and a longer flavor progression.  I really did like this one and it did not contain any unlikable notes like their Pumpernickel Porter.

Holy cow, whats with all the sourness?  The Morke was fairly sour as well, although not this bad.  So its probably as the brewer intends, but seriouisly...undrinkably sour, and quite astringent to boot.  So, the mouth experience is pretty unpleasant other than the thick, creamy texture.

Notes of citrus, pine, coffee grounds, chocolate, burnt toast, slight chocolate. This one is interesting in all the right ways and is one well done beer.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"

3986,"2009-10-02",4.2,"Very nice, hoppy stout.  This beer pours deep and dark, opaquely black.  The liquid actually seemed quite viscous during the pour.  It feels like a heavy glass of beer, though the hops and roasted malt balance out this weight on the palate.  Anyway, the head is thick, creamy and mocha-colored.  The beer smells quite good.  Its floral and a bit piney with some deep coffee/chocolate malt character.  I was expecting more hops and more aroma punch, but whats there is quite nice and hardly the mess thats possible with this sort of experimentation.  The flavor is just wonderful and delivers the hop punch that I expected in the aroma.  Its mostly a bitter bite, but there are some citric/pine notes around the edges and at the finish.  The malt flavors are round and full.  Theres a lot of roast, some fruitiness, prunes and raspberries, and an excellent coffee note.  Id call it a stout, but the hopping makes the strong ale categorization understandable.  Really good beer.  Im excited that were getting Beer Here in San Francisco.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Black colour with huge head. The hoparoma is intense, with hard, grassy, green, almost pepper-like hops. Due to the hard (dry)hopping, the darker malts get less outspoken. Here is licorice most prominent. Flavour brings more maltiness. Big licorice, along with dakr, peppery chocolate. The attenuation seems a bit low, just like the Ølfabrikken brews. Thats not a problem with me, as long as the beers are this tasty. Good hoppy flavour along with a solid bitter finish. On a first glance, I would call this an Imperial Porter, just like the heavily hopped Gonzo. Great beer nevertheless!","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rickgordon"
3986,"2009-05-25",3.7,"Bottle. Black with huge brown head. Aroma fresh hopy wit a little sweetness and after a while roasted malts. Taste roasted malts a little coffee and some hops to finish things off. Palate thick and syrupy. Another interesting beer from Beer Here. Somewhere on the border between American strong ale and Imperial Stout by my opinion, but the brewer says ASA. Lorteøllene er efterladt hos Ølfabrikken, og de gode fortsætter hos Beer Here.","Nibe, DENMARK","rane"

3986,"2009-05-22",4.3,"Bottle. Thanks to Enjoyit. Pours black with a firm light brown head. Some lacing. Aroma is roasted with pine hops; like a mix of a stout and an (I)IPA. Well-balanced and very nice. Flavour is pretty much like the aroma; again; well-balanced and very nice. Finish is a lingering bitterness with roasted and tart notes. Soft palate with a touch of too much carbonation; otherwise very good. A beer like this could have been quite cloying in the long run, but surprisingly isnt at all.

3986,"2009-05-17",3.9,"(Bottle) Pours black with a large, creamy brown head. The aroma is heavily (dry) hopped with a striking green profile of resiny wood, dry grapefruit, earth and sticky cannabis alongside mild herbal and mild floral hints. The roasted malt brings dry tones of liquorice, tar, coffee and some dark chocolate. A whisper of smoke and spicy rye is also present. A typical Danish nose with boat loads of roast and hops. Some hints of brown sugar make the aroma more complex. The flavour is lightly sweet, lightly acidic and medium to heavily bitter. Tones of resin, wood, grapefruit, flowers, coffee, brown sugar, asphalt, tar and liquorice. The mouthfeel is soft, round and light creamy with light to medium carbonation. Citric resiny hops and roast lingers. Medium to full bodied. Pretty much like an old Ølfabrikken beer - but on hop crack. Nice.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","Marsiblursi"
