1863,"2016-01-18",3.9,"0,33l bottle. Pours deep amber with thin white head. Nose is country wine cellar: wine, oak, some salt, bourbon, warm alcohol. Medium body. Taste is dry with pronounced oak overtones and crisp slightly hoppy finish. More like a good strong pills with some barrel nuances than a traditional bock. Still a good beer though.","MOLDOVA","sunstoneale"
1863,"2016-01-14",4.2,"Pours amber and somewhat flat looking into the glass. Very little head. Aroma is of oak and bourbon, but with an apple cider fruitiness. Taste is buttery, with noticeable strands of vanilla and rum, and just a hint of smokiness underlying it all. Carbonation is soft. Body is medium, slightly viscuous, and each sip ends with a warm, long, and lightly bitter finish. Intriguing. This has a very high drinkability ... wish I had another bottle of this. A very good bock.","Butzbach, Hesse, GERMANY","hauxe"

1863,"2015-10-20",3.0,"Nice crystal clear caramel color covered by a white head of medium stability.
Wooden aromas combined with bourbon notes, caramel and dried raisin, rhum.
The first sip is sweet and blasts of bourbon and rhum notes. The alcohol burn is overdefined in my eyes, too heavy for a 6.6 ABV beer. Didnt they empty the barrels before filling them with this Bock? Three months in bourbon, rum and tequila barrels sounds a lot, but it isnt. Seems that the aromas are somehow enhanced. There are a lot of barrel aged beers that stay longer in barrels but have a smoother, more subtle and harmonic taste picture.
Thats why the balance is not at a top level. Welde gives an optimal drinking temperature of 12°C and its true that at this temp the different aromas and flavors combine the best.
The body is full and the finish is warm, lasting and full of dried fruit sweetness.","Vught, NETHERLANDS","TheFoamhead"

1863,"2015-08-11",2.6,"UPDATED: SEP 16, 2015 33cl, Welde sampler Maruhn. Upfront perfumy barrel wafts, mild yet all honey and vanilla, like impregnated wood for interior design use. Instead of a yeast complexity, there is an architecture of a lean, sweetish Heller Bock providing the base on which some vanilla and mild rum perfumes perch, whilst the tequila seems to thin out the mouthfeel to provide a higher drinkability, yet also produces some gin-jenever notes that donot find a home in the Bocks flavour profile. Quite some rummed butterscotch and even real cream butter in mouthfeel, odd. Really missing depth of flavours here, as in the other two Welde craft experiments.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"
