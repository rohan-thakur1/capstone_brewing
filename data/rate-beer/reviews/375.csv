375,"2017-06-03",4.0,"Bottle shared at Akkurat. Haz dark orange color with bo head. Aroma is a bit plasticy, lots of Iris-like hoppy pale lambic, dusty, peach skin. Taste is subtle peach, dank, a bit of barnyard, moss, musty, wet wood, foresty, but well-balanced. Ridiculously dry, slightly bitter woody finish. Mouthfeel is oily and a bit watery, due to the incredible dry. Complexity is high, but I get why some people are not convinced. I like it a lot though.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","SinH4"
375,"2016-12-29",3.6,"Bottle at Akkurat on 11/28/16.Rapidly fizzling bubbles top a mostly clear, brassy-golden body with moderate carbonation visible.Strong acidity in the nose reminds, to some extent, of Cantillon vintages of old (not that old though, maybe like ca. 2004). More acetic character than is found now. Very oaky, much more so than I can remember most any Cantillon beer being. Wouldnt call it overdone but it doesnt help with the already surplus of acetic character. Grapefruit rind on the end announces the lactic acidity and there is no flaw or alcohol. Certainly very mousey-funky.The flavor follows the nose to a T. Unfortunately, that means a surplus of acidity, quite biting and dry and seemingly not supported by quite enough malt/body. Lots of oak, acetic character and lactic character. Quite sour, but just too thin, really. It gets a little softer, with warming/breathing, but its still so young. I assume, like GCB and Iris do, it will get much better with 5-10 years on it, but its a bit worrisome about the thinness.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
375,"2016-12-27",4.1,"Bottled at Akkurat, Stockholm.  Hazy orange colour, no head. Intense minerally barnyard aroma. Bone dry with light-medium body and rounded mouthfeel, perfectly still. Citric and spicy with stable and distinct stale hop bitterness. Intense, rich and unique.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
375,"2016-11-02",3.8,"Bottle at akkurat. Pours clear dark blonde, no real head. Smell is sour, dry, fruity, oak, very full. Taste is sour, dry, some iris-components coming trough. Very sour background. Intense !","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"
375,"2016-08-29",3.4,"Bottle purchased with my wife on a visit to Akkurat. Bottle opens with no pop whatsoever. Pours a brownish orange in color, almost cider-like in appearance. Very few bubbles on first pour. Nose is gentle and inviting with nice floral notes from the Iris. Taste is again floral with a good balance between the acidity and sweetness. I taste elderflower and my wife tastes lemon oil. Moderate mouthfeel, not really watery. Flat and somewhat slick though. Blend seems pretty young still. Not entirely loving the current beer, but think it can be a beauty if allowed the proper amount of time to age.","Illinois, USA","Dunt"
375,"2016-08-18",4.1,"(750ml shared w/phyllomedusa @ Akkurat, June 4 2016) Pours slightly hazy pale burnt orange with no head. Aroma has a core of dark wildflower honey, slight caramel, grainy bread, loads of wood and attic notes, cobwebs, musty, very subtle green apple and cider, floral, dry grass, almost oxidized notes and a hint of very young cheese. Flavour is lightly sour with a surprisingly sweet honey and malt core from the Iris component, light cider vinegar, floral, crab apple, lots of wood planks, old dried hops, tannic, puckering quality to the finish with loads and loads of wood in the aftertaste along with a slight cheesy note. Medium bodied, flat. Still in its infancy and likely will become something special with time, but its drinking quite well already. Fairly austere overall but the sweetness at the centre bumps up drinkability, and there are lots of layers to enjoy. A real thinker!","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"
375,"2016-07-27",3.9,"Bottle @ Akkurat. Clear golden with a tiny off-white head. Aroma is sweet, malty, lemon, wood and barnyard. Flavor is medium sweet and moderate acidic. Dry and moderate acidic finish. I had this next to Zenne y Frontera, and while this is still a very good beer, it was vastly inferior. 270716","Beder, Aarhus, DENMARK","Rasmus40"
375,"2016-06-20",3.9,"A complex, still treat packed with subtlety. Has little to no carbonation but did pour with a slight large-bubbled pseudo froth, rich golden color. Very nice body, smooth and light on the palate. I enjoyed how the Iris GC juxtaposed with the stillness of the GCB seemed to give off a slight ACV note. Would be a treat to see how this one ages, but Im afraid it likely wont be around for much longer. Heres to another 20 years!","Massachusetts, USA","gn0sis"
375,"2016-05-16",4.0,"Bottle at Akkurat. 
Aroma has a nice Iris note to it with some medium light oak and a hint of a sherry character. Medium light oak notes. 
Pours still with a classic, somewhat clear, golden orange. 
Flavor is very Iris-like with a nice herbal, spice note. Medium light oak. Some light bitterness. Hint of sherry character in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with no carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice beer but it is very much like Iris Grand Cru right now. Some Bruscella notes, would be really curious to try this again in a few years.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
375,"2016-04-11",2.7,"Bottle at Akkurat. Hazy golden with very small white head. A blend of my two least favorites from Cantillon, does two wrongs make a right? No. Some hay, funk and wood and not so much else.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","Nische"

A bit hazy golden with no head. Flat with apples, lemon, grape, oak, some hay and funk. Really easy to drink. Medium sour and with dry finish. Tasty. I wonder how this will taste 2035?","Stockholm, SWEDEN","gyllenbock"
375,"2016-01-07",3.9,"Bottle at Akkurat season 15/16 cork. A slightly cloudy beer with a light amber color, totally flat with no bubbles what so ever! Aroma consists of a few spices including coriander seeds, fennel seed and onion powder. The beer got a big mouth coating mouth feel, slightly thick (for a lambic). I can feel both the Oude lambic and the Iris in this blend! The smoothness of lambic and the tartness of Iris. The taste is long lasting with a lot of cognac notes, red apple purè in the mouth but quickly fading to give away to a hay flavour.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","Ludvig"

375,"2015-12-27",4.0,"Bottle at Akkurats 20th anniversary party. Still. Very young and wheat forward. light/miild funk, very low acidity. Super drinkable, I could drink a pitcher everyday for a week. The beer has not yet developed into what is was meant to be. I look forward to drinking this in 20 year and being blown away.","Dallas, Texas, USA","Experiment_Ale"
375,"2015-12-27",4.0,"@ Akkurats 20th Anniversary Party. Lightly hazy bronze color. Both aroma and flavor are sprung from Iris with tasty influences of old Bruoscella, enhanced by mild body with small bubbles. Mellow yet beautiful with lots and lots of potential. Slight sweetness from Bruoscella with flavors of soaked wood and a somewhat tart and mild bitterness. Promising yet extremely sessionable!","SWEDEN","manker"
